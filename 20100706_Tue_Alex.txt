[00:00:05.185 --> 00:00:10.007]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[00:00:10.007 --> 00:00:11.608]  You want answers?
[00:00:11.608 --> 00:00:13.149]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:13.149 --> 00:00:17.351]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.351 --> 00:00:23.714]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:23.714 --> 00:00:25.015]  We're live, my friends.
[00:00:25.015 --> 00:00:27.116]  It is Tuesday, the 6th day of July, 2010.
[00:00:27.116 --> 00:00:30.477]  We're going to be live here for the next four hours.
[00:00:36.394 --> 00:00:42.765]  The Drudge Report's top headline is Big Sis Blocks Websites with Controversial Opinions.
[00:00:44.551 --> 00:00:47.112]  That, of course, is our headline from yesterday.
[00:00:47.112 --> 00:01:06.121]  TSA to block websites with controversial opinions is the PrisonPlanet.com article, but the Drudge Report, and I'm glad he did link to it, CBS News, he basically used our headline, but linked to CBS News with the headline, TSA to block controversial opinions on the web.
[00:01:08.112 --> 00:01:12.516]  And I'm glad that Drudge is covering this.
[00:01:12.516 --> 00:01:33.633]  I'm glad CBS is covering this because I was driving around this morning, taking care of some errands on my way to work and scanning through the talk radio dial and tuned in to a national morning show that was making a joke about our PrisonPlanet.com article.
[00:01:35.888 --> 00:01:43.671]  Making jokes about our conspiracy theories that the government would ever censor the internet.
[00:01:43.671 --> 00:01:52.695]  Because I tuned in and a caller was talking about how we had written an article a few weeks ago titled, Obama to have kill switch over internet.
[00:01:52.695 --> 00:01:58.998]  Since then, literally hundreds of newspapers have run with a similar headline because that's actually how the government describes it.
[00:02:00.714 --> 00:02:03.415]  And so I'm really glad that people are making fun of us.
[00:02:03.415 --> 00:02:05.637]  That means we're dangerous to them.
[00:02:05.637 --> 00:02:08.618]  It means the system is concerned.
[00:02:08.618 --> 00:02:15.962]  And it's great to be able to randomly turn on the radio and to hear someone talking about PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:02:15.962 --> 00:02:23.946]  What's even more incredible is I then went in a store, walked out 10 minutes later, flipped to a local station,
[00:02:25.931 --> 00:02:36.737]  And heard a caller talking about how the federal government is using this as a beta test, the TSA censoring what's on government computers.
[00:02:36.737 --> 00:02:52.287]  And the caller was saying it was a beta test, very astutely, and that the head of the FCC, the head of the Federal Trade Commission, and others have all called in recent months for censoring the internet as a whole.
[00:02:53.394 --> 00:03:03.988]  And putting software in to all new computers, basically black boxes, Australia's already doing this, that tracks everything you look at and sensors what you can look at.
[00:03:03.988 --> 00:03:06.111]  So both spies on you and gatekeeps.
[00:03:07.523 --> 00:03:07.623]  and
[00:03:28.294 --> 00:03:39.782]  Something that's thought-provoking, but still, you know, the issue was here was this local show first making fun of me and then making fun of another show.
[00:03:39.782 --> 00:03:43.465]  And it shows just what incredible denial people are in.
[00:03:43.465 --> 00:03:52.251]  I don't think that national show was making fun of me because there's so much government agents as they're just in denial.
[00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:55.201]  Deep denial.
[00:03:55.201 --> 00:04:00.585]  Because they've heard us talk about this for years, how this was coming, and now that it is unfolding, they're in denial.
[00:04:00.585 --> 00:04:06.549]  And I don't think the local show or feds, they're just under mind control.
[00:04:06.549 --> 00:04:18.498]  They just basically regurgitate and promote whatever they want.
[00:04:18.498 --> 00:04:19.919]  They just go along with
[00:04:21.892 --> 00:04:32.438]  The system and they think that they can choose whatever the reality is and that the system offers them a nice false reality that everything's fine and we're not even in a recession.
[00:04:32.438 --> 00:04:36.901]  I mean, they're having debates in the media, the mainstream media, about are we in a recession again?
[00:04:36.901 --> 00:04:38.241]  Is it a double dip?
[00:04:38.241 --> 00:04:39.122]  We're in a depression.
[00:04:40.464 --> 00:04:45.470]  Alright, that's just some of the news that's coming up today, and of course your phone calls.
[00:04:45.470 --> 00:04:55.261]  And we've got Mike Rivera popping in in the second hour, and just a bunch of really important news today that is going to be vital for everyone to be made aware of.
[00:04:55.261 --> 00:04:57.183]  We'll be right back after this quick break.
[00:04:57.183 --> 00:04:59.786]  The website's rinfowars.com or prisonplot.com.
[00:05:00.166 --> 00:05:05.131]  The question is, where should the American people draw their line in the sand?
[00:05:05.131 --> 00:05:06.132]  What have we got?
[00:05:06.132 --> 00:05:08.574]  A republic or a monarchy?
[00:05:08.574 --> 00:05:09.575]  A republic.
[00:05:09.575 --> 00:05:12.237]  It's based on a constitution which protects minority rights.
[00:05:12.237 --> 00:05:14.499]  Not democracy, not mob rule.
[00:05:14.499 --> 00:05:16.521]  Two wolves and a sheep voting on what's for dinner.
[00:05:16.521 --> 00:05:18.203]  So they think they own our land?
[00:05:18.203 --> 00:05:19.524]  They think they own our water?
[00:05:19.524 --> 00:05:20.125]  Children?
[00:05:20.125 --> 00:05:21.246]  Our education?
[00:05:21.246 --> 00:05:22.086]  Our money?
[00:05:22.086 --> 00:05:25.730]  We have to define who we are and what we will tolerate.
[00:05:26.090 --> 00:05:31.055]  Somebody's gonna ask you what you did during the Patriot Uprising.
[00:05:31.055 --> 00:05:32.076]  We have the facts.
[00:05:32.076 --> 00:05:33.237]  We have the Constitution.
[00:05:33.237 --> 00:05:34.158]  We have the Bill of Rights.
[00:05:34.158 --> 00:05:35.039]  We have common law.
[00:05:35.039 --> 00:05:37.561]  Knowledge is power, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:05:37.561 --> 00:05:41.345]  And I'm so excited to be able to offer you Don't Tread on Me, Rise of the Republic.
[00:05:41.445 --> 00:05:46.391]  Tyranny is upon us, but liberty and the sleeping giant that is the American people is rising.
[00:05:46.391 --> 00:05:47.893]  A new tool in the Info War.
[00:05:47.893 --> 00:05:48.994]  Don't tread on me.
[00:05:48.994 --> 00:05:55.862]  Order it at InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com or call toll free 888-253-3139 and support independent patriotic liberty films.
[00:05:59.947 --> 00:06:04.411]  Alex Jones here with urgent information concerning TrendsResearch.com.
[00:06:04.411 --> 00:06:11.898]  The Trends Journal distills the voluminous ongoing research of the Trends Research Institute into a concise, readily accessible form.
[00:06:11.898 --> 00:06:15.342]  By tracking 300 separately defined domestic and international trends,
[00:06:15.942 --> 00:06:20.464]  The Trends Journal establishes the connections that others fail to see or misinterpret.
[00:06:20.464 --> 00:06:28.326]  Gerald Salente's Trends Journal allows you to anticipate change, recognize the implications, and take protective strategies.
[00:06:28.326 --> 00:06:33.028]  Individual readers from every walk of life can put the Trends Journal Trends Forecast
[00:06:33.348 --> 00:06:33.708]  I'm good.
[00:06:59.707 --> 00:07:03.910]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones asking you for a minute of your time to tell you about soap.
[00:07:03.910 --> 00:07:10.315]  Not detergents, but good old-fashioned pure soap made by the Calbin Soap Company, a family-owned and operated American company.
[00:07:10.315 --> 00:07:17.701]  My family, staff, friends, and radio listeners are constantly telling me how much they love these products for bath, hair, laundry, and dishes.
[00:07:17.701 --> 00:07:22.585]  There is nothing like these factory-direct, big-money-saving, triple-concentrated soaps anywhere.
[00:07:22.585 --> 00:07:24.727]  Get a free, detailed catalog by calling 800-340-7091.
[00:07:27.529 --> 00:07:31.272]  As founder and owner for over 63 years, people keep asking me, how's business?
[00:07:31.272 --> 00:07:33.573]  I'm happy to say our business is going down the drain.
[00:07:33.573 --> 00:07:33.894]  Call us!
[00:07:47.043 --> 00:07:55.566]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[00:07:55.566 --> 00:07:58.187]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:13.340 --> 00:08:16.201]  It is Tuesday, the sixth day of July, 2010.
[00:08:16.201 --> 00:08:19.083]  We're going to be live here for the next four hours.
[00:08:19.083 --> 00:08:25.366]  Thank you so much for joining us, my friends.
[00:08:25.366 --> 00:08:28.848]  I want to repeat, basically, what I talked about yesterday.
[00:08:28.848 --> 00:08:34.951]  We have CNBC, we have the London Telegraph, we have the New York Times, the Associated Press, Reuters.
[00:08:36.170 --> 00:08:39.671]  All now saying that we're in a depression, not a recession.
[00:08:39.671 --> 00:08:49.253]  Now they've known this for the last two years, and they've steadfastly gone along with the government propaganda that we were in this wonderful, fabulous recovery.
[00:08:49.253 --> 00:08:51.154]  Now they admit that 46 U.S.
[00:08:51.154 --> 00:08:56.375]  states are on the verge of collapsing, have already gone into bankruptcy.
[00:08:58.191 --> 00:09:15.259]  All over the nation, county cities are laying off large portions of their city and county staff, but the taxes are going up that are paid on interest to the private banks, because those cities and counties and states were swindled into buying derivatives.
[00:09:15.259 --> 00:09:18.180]  And God forbid the bankers ever go to jail for this.
[00:09:18.180 --> 00:09:20.802]  God forbid the Ponzi scheme operators ever get in trouble.
[00:09:20.802 --> 00:09:21.622]  No.
[00:09:21.622 --> 00:09:23.003]  Our taxes must go up.
[00:09:23.823 --> 00:09:37.333]  And everything must be paid to the criminals, because they control the media and own the media, and they say so, and they're wearing fancy suits.
[00:09:37.333 --> 00:09:47.641]  And so like programmed lemmings, everyone is marching like drone robots, biological androids, off the edge of the cliff.
[00:09:47.641 --> 00:09:51.324]  And so the system is now shifting into depression.
[00:09:52.483 --> 00:09:58.449]  They're now shifting into admitting we're in a depression, but don't worry, they've got a plan to fix it.
[00:09:58.449 --> 00:10:16.847]  If we'll just pay carbon taxes, this is being announced everywhere now in the last week, if we'll just pay carbon taxes to the very same private six banks and give them global government power, that's now a quote, global governance, global government, they've got a plan that'll fix it and they'll loan you more money.
[00:10:18.897 --> 00:10:28.644]  So they've got a plan, more taxes that'll further stall the economy and carbon taxes selectively enforced on anybody they want.
[00:10:28.644 --> 00:10:33.448]  And then when things get worse, they'll have more government as the solution.
[00:10:33.448 --> 00:10:42.695]  And then when things get worse after that, they'll have more solutions which will make things worse.
[00:10:44.687 --> 00:10:47.994]  This is all being done by design.
[00:10:53.092 --> 00:10:58.977]  And the bureaucrats that are left are the hardest, meanest, most vicious enforcers.
[00:10:58.977 --> 00:11:02.059]  And they're going to squeeze the blood out of you.
[00:11:02.059 --> 00:11:04.641]  And they're going to take your farms and your ranches.
[00:11:04.641 --> 00:11:07.343]  They're going to harass the Amish off their land.
[00:11:07.343 --> 00:11:15.389]  They're going to take your children for abortion rackets in the United States, England, and Europe before your baby's even born.
[00:11:15.389 --> 00:11:17.691]  They're already tracking you through the medical system.
[00:11:18.931 --> 00:11:25.196]  And have actuaries on what color the child's eyes and hair are going to be and what family wants it.
[00:11:25.196 --> 00:11:30.319]  They've already got little computer programs on what trumped up charges to put on you.
[00:11:30.319 --> 00:11:38.284]  Until we wake up to the fact that we are the food.
[00:11:38.284 --> 00:11:39.625]  That's what tyranny is.
[00:11:39.625 --> 00:11:42.787]  Crooks take over government and the people are the food.
[00:11:44.008 --> 00:11:46.030]  We are the slave labor.
[00:11:46.030 --> 00:11:47.591]  We are the cannon fodder.
[00:11:47.591 --> 00:11:48.812]  This is tyranny.
[00:11:48.812 --> 00:11:50.053]  We know what it looks like.
[00:11:50.053 --> 00:12:04.804]  The cameras, the microphones hidden in lampposts, the children trained to spy on their parents, thumb scanning to get school lunches, to get library books, to go in the tanning salon, or to go to work and clock in and clock out.
[00:12:04.804 --> 00:12:07.787]  We know what tyranny is.
[00:12:07.787 --> 00:12:08.968]  They just phase it in.
[00:12:09.892 --> 00:12:17.257]  Where all new cell phones track you in real time and the NSA dials in and listens to you with keyword software.
[00:12:17.257 --> 00:12:18.338]  You want a cell phone?
[00:12:18.338 --> 00:12:19.298]  They all have it.
[00:12:19.298 --> 00:12:20.679]  That's the way it is.
[00:12:20.679 --> 00:12:24.241]  Standardized worldwide in international agreements in 1996.
[00:12:24.241 --> 00:12:30.225]  It's all standardized.
[00:12:30.225 --> 00:12:34.068]  We had to buy a Byzantine old-fashioned
[00:12:36.001 --> 00:12:45.425]  Punching clock, and I was trying to buy a new one from the one we bought a few years ago, and it just doesn't exist.
[00:12:45.425 --> 00:12:50.567]  Every system is thumbprint.
[00:12:50.567 --> 00:12:54.509]  See, that's how they get you.
[00:12:54.509 --> 00:13:00.612]  They're now coming out with ATMs all over the world where you must thumb scan to get the money.
[00:13:01.561 --> 00:13:06.383]  That everything you do is tracked and controlled and it trains you to completely phase out of the cash.
[00:13:06.383 --> 00:13:08.244]  And then you're fully under their control.
[00:13:08.244 --> 00:13:09.544]  Everything you do being tracked.
[00:13:09.544 --> 00:13:12.885]  Everything you do being traced.
[00:13:12.885 --> 00:13:14.086]  Now they know your habits.
[00:13:14.086 --> 00:13:15.526]  They know what you're purchasing.
[00:13:15.526 --> 00:13:18.187]  They've got a better psychological profile on you.
[00:13:18.187 --> 00:13:19.948]  They can turn your thumbprint off.
[00:13:19.948 --> 00:13:27.971]  I mean, do you understand that criminals took control of society and the banking system and the issuance of currency and credit a long time ago?
[00:13:31.204 --> 00:13:47.177]  And they figured out that, well, when we do engage in this Ponzi scheme by design, and when we do make everybody bankrupt and poor, so they will be forced onto socialism and government plantations and reservations, that when we do this, they're going to rebel.
[00:13:47.177 --> 00:13:57.225]  And so we've got to shut down the farms, the ranches, we've got to shut down the industry, we've got to shut down the factories, we've got to get everyone dependent.
[00:13:57.918 --> 00:14:00.519]  Before we pull the rug out from under them.
[00:14:00.519 --> 00:14:09.901]  And we've got to have Pentagon-designed microphones at four-way stops, even in small towns.
[00:14:09.901 --> 00:14:23.824]  Nationwide, for at least a decade, they have hundreds of thousands of microphones hooked into the NSA in parks and in malls and on street corners and
[00:14:25.948 --> 00:14:33.510]  In businesses just everywhere hooked into the NSA, listening to everything you're doing.
[00:14:33.510 --> 00:14:39.992]  And if somebody complains and says, why is there microphones on that cameras that the feds put in with this local grant?
[00:14:39.992 --> 00:14:41.853]  They say, oh, that's a gunshot detector.
[00:14:47.042 --> 00:14:49.544]  Just a little plausible cover story.
[00:14:49.544 --> 00:14:54.868]  Doesn't matter that you go one millimeter beneath the surface, and it's all admitted it's NSA.
[00:14:54.868 --> 00:15:14.925]  All admitted that they're tracking everything you're doing with high-def, omnidirectional, and shotgun mics from hundreds of yards away, recording everything you say, and sending it through behavioral, controlled, analytical systems that gauge your tone,
[00:15:16.750 --> 00:15:21.431]  Oh yes, when it hears you whispering, that's what it hones in on.
[00:15:21.431 --> 00:15:30.074]  And then the public finds out they're actually recording it and listening to it and running it through NSA computers and they say, well, this way we'll stop family violence.
[00:15:30.074 --> 00:15:37.096]  If we hear someone cussing at someone or we hear someone sounding angry, we go ahead and alert police.
[00:15:37.096 --> 00:15:45.439]  And now they're coming out admitting, oh, and then when the camera is now able to zoom in on the person who sounds angry and then face scans you,
[00:15:47.990 --> 00:15:53.311]  It takes a digital image in the high-def camera, uploads it instantly.
[00:15:53.311 --> 00:15:55.492]  London admitted five years ago they have these.
[00:15:55.492 --> 00:16:02.993]  Runs it against hundreds of thousands of people in the local area, then runs it against larger databases in seconds.
[00:16:02.993 --> 00:16:05.794]  Oh, Mr. Johnson, you were seen yelling at your children.
[00:16:05.794 --> 00:16:07.514]  Well, yeah, they were running out in the street.
[00:16:07.514 --> 00:16:09.575]  That's abuse.
[00:16:09.575 --> 00:16:10.735]  We're gonna take your children.
[00:16:14.053 --> 00:16:19.915]  We're going to dispatch little secret police who use color of law excuses to take control of you.
[00:16:19.915 --> 00:16:25.576]  I mean, I have all the mainstream news here in front of me.
[00:16:25.576 --> 00:16:30.618]  All of a sudden, scores of newspapers the last three days came out and said,
[00:16:31.727 --> 00:16:34.528]  Yes, we are recording you.
[00:16:34.528 --> 00:16:37.369]  Yes, we are tracking your cell phones in real time.
[00:16:37.369 --> 00:16:54.697]  Yes, we can predict what you're going to do with over a 93% total certainty, 93% of the time, they have total certainty of where you're going and what you're going to do next before you know it, because you're not consciously aware of patterns that you carry out.
[00:16:56.516 --> 00:17:07.146]  You have a literal crystal ball future prediction modeling system aggressively scanning everything you do.
[00:17:07.146 --> 00:17:13.151]  The entire world is being weaponized against us.
[00:17:13.151 --> 00:17:22.900]  Police are now being trained, not just on bomb retrieval or bomb disposal robots, but aggressor robots, killer robots.
[00:17:24.329 --> 00:17:31.691]  Sound cannons, microwave guns.
[00:17:31.691 --> 00:17:38.153]  And the only jobs your sons and daughters can get now will be servicing these and operating these.
[00:17:38.153 --> 00:17:40.474]  There's going to be those of us that are basically slaves.
[00:17:42.224 --> 00:18:01.441]  And work in the slave grids, and then there's gonna be the overseers all on their arrogant power trips, and the symbiosis, the synthesis of the worst of society, the most controlling, the most thuggish, the most hateful, the most greedy, are gonna rule over us, and they're gonna take our women.
[00:18:01.841 --> 00:18:03.542]  They're going to abuse our wives.
[00:18:03.542 --> 00:18:06.704]  They're going to demand our daughters, many of our daughters.
[00:18:06.704 --> 00:18:07.965]  This is what happens in a tyranny.
[00:18:07.965 --> 00:18:10.186]  We'll actually bow down to the black uniforms.
[00:18:10.186 --> 00:18:18.331]  You'll have to sit there while the Nazi scum is in your house, you know, bringing them coffee, kissing up to them.
[00:18:18.331 --> 00:18:21.913]  You're going to live in hell.
[00:18:21.913 --> 00:18:23.194]  Hell is here.
[00:18:23.194 --> 00:18:26.176]  Hardcore scientific tyranny.
[00:18:26.176 --> 00:18:27.256]  Now here's what I'm going to do.
[00:18:27.256 --> 00:18:27.837]  I'm not going to take
[00:18:30.154 --> 00:18:36.655]  A lot of calls in the last hour today.
[00:18:36.655 --> 00:18:48.818]  But in the first, second, and third, I am, but I've got a lot of video and audio clips I wanna play, and so we'll get to some of those today, but most of them, we'll get to some of those today early in the show, but most of them in the last hour.
[00:18:48.818 --> 00:18:53.239]  I wanna play different clips and analyze them here on air and go over some legislation.
[00:18:53.239 --> 00:18:55.499]  I do have a lot of news to cover as well.
[00:18:55.499 --> 00:18:57.500]  But I wanna open the phones up and ask you
[00:18:59.594 --> 00:19:01.735]  A. How bad do you think the depression's gonna get?
[00:19:01.735 --> 00:19:03.556]  We've been in it for two years, conservatively.
[00:19:03.556 --> 00:19:04.837]  Recession for four to six.
[00:19:04.837 --> 00:19:08.239]  Depending on how you look at the numbers, the real numbers.
[00:19:08.239 --> 00:19:18.245]  And B. Why is the media now... Why is the media now starting to admit that they're gonna censor the internet?
[00:19:18.245 --> 00:19:20.906]  And admitting that, okay, we're listening to you with microphones everywhere.
[00:19:20.906 --> 00:19:22.647]  I mean, this is beyond 1984.
[00:19:22.647 --> 00:19:26.330]  And yeah, we're taking your baby's blood.
[00:19:26.330 --> 00:19:27.250]  They just do everything.
[00:19:27.250 --> 00:19:28.551]  They're just total crooks.
[00:19:32.734 --> 00:19:33.394]  Makes me angry.
[00:19:33.394 --> 00:19:35.415]  And it makes me sad.
[00:19:35.415 --> 00:19:38.335]  Makes me disgusted.
[00:19:38.335 --> 00:19:44.456]  The problem is they've got a computer screen in here that's running through a slideshow of the front page of InfoWars.com.
[00:19:44.456 --> 00:19:49.337]  And I just keep looking at all the scum and all the government people and it makes me mad.
[00:19:49.337 --> 00:19:53.118]  Anyways, I'm going to take a lot of your phone calls on any issue you wish to discuss after this quick break.
[00:19:53.118 --> 00:19:53.198]  1-800-259-9231.
[00:19:53.198 --> 00:19:54.238]  We'll be right back.
[00:19:54.238 --> 00:19:54.678]  Stay with us.
[00:20:00.819 --> 00:20:04.201]  When you hear the words water purification, what comes to mind?
[00:20:04.201 --> 00:20:08.104]  If it's Berkey Water Purification Systems, this message is for you.
[00:20:08.104 --> 00:20:11.826]  Did you know that over 60% of municipal water contains fluoride?
[00:20:11.826 --> 00:20:18.310]  At less than $0.02 per gallon, Berkey water filters purify treated and untreated water, remove dangerous chlorine,
[00:20:18.550 --> 00:20:18.910]  I think so.
[00:20:33.507 --> 00:20:33.947]  I think so.
[00:21:00.731 --> 00:21:05.695]  The question is, where should the American people draw their line in the sand?
[00:21:05.695 --> 00:21:06.695]  What have we got?
[00:21:06.695 --> 00:21:09.157]  A republic or a monarchy?
[00:21:09.157 --> 00:21:10.158]  A republic.
[00:21:10.158 --> 00:21:12.800]  It's based on a constitution which protects minority rights.
[00:21:12.800 --> 00:21:15.062]  Not democracy, not mob rule.
[00:21:15.062 --> 00:21:17.103]  Two wolves and a sheep voting on what's for dinner.
[00:21:17.103 --> 00:21:18.784]  So they think they own our land?
[00:21:18.784 --> 00:21:20.105]  They think they own our water?
[00:21:20.105 --> 00:21:20.706]  Children?
[00:21:20.706 --> 00:21:21.827]  Our education?
[00:21:21.827 --> 00:21:22.647]  Our money?
[00:21:22.647 --> 00:21:26.310]  We have to define who we are and what we will tolerate.
[00:21:26.670 --> 00:21:30.354]  Somebody's gonna ask you what you did during the Patriot Uprising.
[00:21:30.354 --> 00:21:31.616]  You're being warned.
[00:21:31.616 --> 00:21:32.657]  We have the facts.
[00:21:32.657 --> 00:21:33.818]  We have the Constitution.
[00:21:33.818 --> 00:21:34.740]  We have the Bill of Rights.
[00:21:34.740 --> 00:21:35.621]  We have common law.
[00:21:35.621 --> 00:21:38.144]  Knowledge is power, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:21:38.144 --> 00:21:41.087]  And I'm so excited to be able to offer you Don't Tread on Me.
[00:21:41.087 --> 00:21:41.908]  Rise of the Republic.
[00:21:42.028 --> 00:21:46.971]  Tyranny is upon us, but liberty and the sleeping giant that is the American people is rising.
[00:21:46.971 --> 00:21:48.472]  A new tool in the Info War.
[00:21:48.472 --> 00:21:49.553]  Don't tread on me.
[00:21:49.553 --> 00:21:55.997]  Order it at InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com or call toll free 888-253-3139 and support independent patriotic liberty films.
[00:22:00.711 --> 00:22:02.973]  Good day, Jim Newcomer from Midas Resources.
[00:22:02.973 --> 00:22:03.453]  July 6th, 2010.
[00:22:03.453 --> 00:22:04.394]  Gold opened this morning at $1206.30.
[00:22:04.394 --> 00:22:07.496]  A one ounce gold coin can be purchased for $1238.59, $619.29 for a half ounce, or $309.65 for the quarter ounce.
[00:22:07.496 --> 00:22:07.956]  That's $1238.59, $619.29, or $309.65.
[00:22:20.362 --> 00:22:23.226]  Making the right decision is a challenge to investors.
[00:22:23.226 --> 00:22:27.511]  Are we going to see economic growth slide into a recession or worse, depression?
[00:22:27.511 --> 00:22:32.397]  Many investors are turning to gold as a common sense alternative to traditional paper investments.
[00:22:32.397 --> 00:22:38.484]  Midas has put together a powerful book titled 10 Reasons to Own Gold, discussing costs, benefits, risks,
[00:22:38.764 --> 00:22:38.984]  I think so.
[00:23:01.263 --> 00:23:02.583]  Who is Sam Andy?
[00:23:02.583 --> 00:23:05.104]  Sam Andy Foods is life insurance in a can.
[00:23:05.104 --> 00:23:06.744]  Life insurance you can eat.
[00:23:06.744 --> 00:23:11.266]  Sam Andy Foods has been serving loyal customers worldwide for over 50 years.
[00:23:11.266 --> 00:23:12.306]  Why so long?
[00:23:12.306 --> 00:23:12.846]  Simple.
[00:23:12.846 --> 00:23:16.667]  Sam Andy Foods have perfected the taste and quality of low-moisture foods.
[00:23:16.667 --> 00:23:19.328]  Foods that last 15 to 25 years.
[00:23:19.328 --> 00:23:24.089]  And that's made us an industry leader among families, sportsmen, outdoorsmen, churches, schools,
[00:23:24.229 --> 00:23:26.051]  People living in remote areas, U.S.
[00:23:26.051 --> 00:23:28.212]  troops in wartime, and many others.
[00:23:28.212 --> 00:23:36.219]  Sam Andy is America's leading supplier of over 100 high-quality, low-moisture products and everything you need to survive in any emergency.

[00:23:57.042 --> 00:23:58.324]  Sam Andy Foods.
[00:23:58.324 --> 00:24:00.147]  Life insurance in a can.
[00:24:03.988 --> 00:24:04.968]  Don't worry.
[00:24:04.968 --> 00:24:06.989]  This show is documented.
[00:24:06.989 --> 00:24:12.252]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:24:12.252 --> 00:24:16.893]  Okay, here's what I'm gonna do.
[00:24:16.893 --> 00:24:20.035]  I'm gonna take calls for the balance of this hour.
[00:24:20.035 --> 00:24:21.195]  Mike Rivera's coming up.
[00:24:21.195 --> 00:24:31.660]  We'll cover a lot of the news on the oil spill, the situation with Iran, what's happening with the economy, but... CNBC, London Telegraph, AP...
[00:24:33.427 --> 00:24:40.969]  Wall Street Journal, New York Times, they're all saying, okay, we're in a depression, but the solution has given the bankers even more power.
[00:24:40.969 --> 00:24:41.769]  They'll save us.
[00:24:41.769 --> 00:24:42.889]  They care about us.
[00:24:42.889 --> 00:24:44.869]  They're good free market people.
[00:24:44.869 --> 00:24:47.670]  They created derivatives and destroyed us.
[00:24:47.670 --> 00:24:48.770]  No, they're not free market.
[00:24:48.770 --> 00:24:51.731]  They're swindling con artists.
[00:24:51.731 --> 00:25:03.073]  But they have bought off the government, put their people in every major regulatory position, not just here in the U.S., but in scores of wealthy nations that they're stealing, blind.
[00:25:04.608 --> 00:25:07.350]  It's very elementary.
[00:25:07.350 --> 00:25:12.815]  But in America now, the worship of government has replaced patriotism.
[00:25:12.815 --> 00:25:26.546]  And so can people wake up fast enough and get serious enough and realize these bankers are going to stage wars, they're going to stage oil spills, they're going to stage all sorts of diversions to complete their world government?
[00:25:28.001 --> 00:25:35.585]  And they've got a bunch of militarized police that think it's macho to basically feed on the public and slap around the slaves.
[00:25:35.585 --> 00:25:38.646]  And the cops have got to ask themselves, I mean, do you like what's happening?
[00:25:38.646 --> 00:25:40.267]  Here's USA Today.
[00:25:40.267 --> 00:25:43.109]  Expect lots of government layoffs at state and local level.
[00:25:43.809 --> 00:25:46.050]  Yeah, notice every, but the feds are hiring.
[00:25:46.050 --> 00:25:48.131]  Their pay is going up, they're hiring.
[00:25:48.131 --> 00:25:52.472]  But once they're done robbing us blind, they're going to lay them off there too.
[00:25:52.472 --> 00:25:53.673]  But the feds don't care.
[00:25:53.673 --> 00:25:59.074]  You feds have got another five years or so left before they start getting rid of most of your jobs.
[00:25:59.074 --> 00:26:01.855]  And then we'll just be a third world wasteland.
[00:26:01.855 --> 00:26:04.016]  But mission complete.
[00:26:04.016 --> 00:26:09.118]  You'll still have bigger pot bellies than anybody else and act cool and have all the special badges though.
[00:26:09.118 --> 00:26:10.659]  Let's go ahead and go to Mike in Texas.
[00:26:10.659 --> 00:26:11.479]  Mike, you're on the air.
[00:26:11.479 --> 00:26:11.779]  Welcome.
[00:26:12.955 --> 00:26:15.717]  Hey Dallas, Dallas, Texas here.
[00:26:15.717 --> 00:26:21.422]  I just want to let you know that, you know, it doesn't sound like I probably have a Texas accent.
[00:26:21.422 --> 00:26:27.566]  I basically voted with my feet and left New York, New Jersey area about six months ago and came to Texas.
[00:26:27.566 --> 00:26:31.369]  I just couldn't stand that police state I was living in out there anymore.
[00:26:31.369 --> 00:26:37.134]  But Alex, I was raised in a family who has very strong Wall Street ties.
[00:26:37.134 --> 00:26:42.178]  I won't give you the name over the air, but if you want to put me on hold, I can give you some names and you can Google them and you can see.
[00:26:43.617 --> 00:26:54.244]  My family, a very close family member, was part of the team that lobbied for the ERISA legislation that created all these 401k, these self-funded retirement plans.
[00:26:54.244 --> 00:27:03.171]  And I remember sitting around the dinner table and around his swimming pool, where he said, these plans are doomed to fail.
[00:27:03.171 --> 00:27:07.354]  What happens, Alex, when you sell a stock in mass quantities?
[00:27:08.908 --> 00:27:11.729]  This is what this person was telling me from the very beginning.
[00:27:11.729 --> 00:27:23.055]  These ERISA plans are going to have laws that say when you reach a certain age, when the baby boomers all reach a certain age, they're going to be forced by law to start liquidating these stocks.
[00:27:23.055 --> 00:27:34.200]  And the value of their plans is going to crash because when you sell a stock in mass quantities, and the baby boomers are the largest group of people who go into retirement in the history of this country,
[00:27:34.946 --> 00:27:38.807]  Those plans, the values of them are going to crash.
[00:27:38.807 --> 00:27:43.889]  When they were lobbying to create the laws so that you could have a 401k plan, they knew.
[00:27:43.889 --> 00:27:48.170]  They knew that these plans were doomed to failure someday.
[00:27:48.170 --> 00:27:55.613]  Well the system's stated goal at the highest levels is to destroy industrialized societies and keep people at subsistence level.
[00:27:55.613 --> 00:27:58.474]  That's why you pay into social security your whole life and at 64 years old,
[00:28:00.374 --> 00:28:00.855]  I mean, look.
[00:28:18.840 --> 00:28:22.944]  It's a complex issue because people say, well, do you have government involved in the stock market or not?
[00:28:22.944 --> 00:28:24.505]  Well, you can't have both.
[00:28:24.505 --> 00:28:32.152]  I mean, either people invest in areas of the market and it's not backed up by the government too big to fail, or you've got to have government involvement.
[00:28:32.152 --> 00:28:34.414]  But it's the perfect storm of government.
[00:28:35.405 --> 00:28:46.471]  Involvement in the corrupt stock market that has allowed this to take place and they wanted to take the investment of the baby boomers and make sure they never got it.
[00:28:46.471 --> 00:29:00.459]  So right as the baby boomers start to retire, most of them have lost about half the value of their 401k and they're staying in to try to keep that other half they've still got and at the end of the day they're going to end up with a pittance of what they ever invested
[00:29:01.139 --> 00:29:07.106]  But the offshore banks, they're going to get the majority of the capital because they're holding us hostage.
[00:29:07.106 --> 00:29:08.107]  It's a complete scam.
[00:29:08.107 --> 00:29:09.009]  Go ahead.
[00:29:09.009 --> 00:29:17.679]  IRAs, another thing that an uncle of mine, he told me, he says, if you think these people who are investing in Roth IRAs are going to get away tax free, no way.
[00:29:17.679 --> 00:29:21.243]  Just like in these other countries where people's pension funds are being stolen from them.
[00:29:21.676 --> 00:29:23.877]  The government is going to change the rules.
[00:29:23.877 --> 00:29:35.245]  You're going to have invested with post-tax money your whole life, and then when you go to withdraw that, the government's going to say, I'm sorry, because of a national issue, we need that money.
[00:29:35.245 --> 00:29:38.367]  We're going to have to change the rules and tax you.
[00:29:38.367 --> 00:29:39.628]  Well, that's already started.
[00:29:39.628 --> 00:29:42.369]  We had the Bloomberg headline two months ago.
[00:29:42.369 --> 00:29:43.130]  Great point, sir.
[00:29:43.130 --> 00:29:44.111]  I appreciate your call.
[00:29:44.111 --> 00:29:45.191]  You ought to write an article about it.
[00:29:45.191 --> 00:29:49.134]  I mean, they announced two months ago they're quietly already taking your pension funds.
[00:29:50.834 --> 00:29:54.761]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[00:29:54.761 --> 00:29:57.446]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:02.059 --> 00:30:06.020]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about the Silver Lungs Generator.
[00:30:06.020 --> 00:30:14.882]  Now you can produce pure and endless colloidal silver and deliver the solution directly into the bloodstream by breathing the solution through the lungs.
[00:30:14.882 --> 00:30:19.503]  The respiratory system is the first line of defense for airborne pathogens and viruses.
[00:30:19.503 --> 00:30:30.325]  The Silver Lungs Generator infuses the respiratory system with your self-produced nano-silver solutions and also delivers the silver nanoparticles instantly into the bloodstream.
[00:30:30.965 --> 00:30:40.467]  With continued legislation threatening the sale of nano silver products, you can now produce pure and endless loyal silver with the Silver Lungs Generator.
[00:30:40.467 --> 00:30:45.909]  Very easy to follow step-by-step instructions are provided, making production fast and simple.
[00:30:45.909 --> 00:30:53.390]  Go to www.SilverLungs.com today and learn more about the breakthrough technology of the Silver Lungs Generator.
[00:30:53.390 --> 00:30:56.151]  That's www.SilverLungs.com.
[00:30:59.940 --> 00:31:04.484]  This is Alex Jones with 5 good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[00:31:04.484 --> 00:31:05.404]  Number 1.
[00:31:05.404 --> 00:31:08.827]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[00:31:08.827 --> 00:31:09.688]  Number 2.
[00:31:09.688 --> 00:31:14.591]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[00:31:14.591 --> 00:31:15.332]  It's true.
[00:31:15.332 --> 00:31:20.196]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[00:31:20.196 --> 00:31:21.036]  Number 3.
[00:31:21.036 --> 00:31:24.619]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[00:31:24.619 --> 00:31:28.322]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[00:31:28.502 --> 00:31:29.302]  Number 4.
[00:31:29.302 --> 00:31:32.063]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[00:31:32.063 --> 00:31:35.744]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[00:31:35.744 --> 00:31:36.544]  Number 5.
[00:31:36.544 --> 00:31:40.685]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[00:31:40.685 --> 00:31:45.747]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[00:31:45.747 --> 00:31:49.908]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[00:31:49.908 --> 00:31:51.709]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[00:31:51.709 --> 00:31:56.310]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun, so go to mysolarbackup.com or call 1-866-422-9000.
[00:31:56.630 --> 00:31:56.710]  877-327-0365.
[00:31:56.710 --> 00:32:03.952]  You may be arrested and or subject to other police action.
[00:32:03.952 --> 00:32:05.212]  Tyranny is here.
[00:32:05.212 --> 00:32:08.933]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[00:32:08.933 --> 00:32:11.374]  It really says that the state is God.
[00:32:11.374 --> 00:32:17.235]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on Earth.
[00:32:17.235 --> 00:32:23.477]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps now being expanded nationwide.
[00:32:23.897 --> 00:32:29.878]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful shadow state.
[00:32:29.878 --> 00:32:34.059]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depths to which our republic has fallen.
[00:32:34.059 --> 00:32:38.340]  Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship.
[00:32:38.340 --> 00:32:44.301]  Body scanners, sound cannons, citizen spies, stage terror and cameras on every street corner.
[00:32:44.301 --> 00:32:47.841]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[00:32:47.841 --> 00:32:49.822]  The police state isn't coming.
[00:32:49.822 --> 00:32:50.262]  It's here.

[00:33:01.249 --> 00:33:06.913]  They railed against the crowd Another ragtag band Declaring independence
[00:33:24.664 --> 00:33:28.868]  Government isn't screwing things up by accident.
[00:33:28.868 --> 00:33:33.973]  This is a tried and true system of dependency.
[00:33:33.973 --> 00:33:41.239]  This is stated by the UN, by the megacorporations, in all their white papers.
[00:33:42.301 --> 00:33:44.943]  They know exactly what they're doing.
[00:33:44.943 --> 00:33:46.885]  They want you dumbed down.
[00:33:46.885 --> 00:33:51.469]  They want you pathetic and wanting and dependent on everything they do.
[00:33:51.469 --> 00:33:55.592]  They don't want you independent and strong and red-blooded.
[00:33:55.592 --> 00:33:57.314]  They want you domesticated.
[00:33:59.397 --> 00:34:00.878]  They want you castrated.
[00:34:00.878 --> 00:34:09.226]  And the only places you're allowed to be, quote, manly or tough guy or macho is within the government system.
[00:34:09.226 --> 00:34:14.751]  And then that's in a limited role of kicking the rest of the sheep around.
[00:34:14.751 --> 00:34:19.656]  That's how these different roles are set up.
[00:34:19.656 --> 00:34:21.518]  This is all social engineering.
[00:34:26.052 --> 00:34:27.915]  We are being socially engineered.
[00:34:27.915 --> 00:34:31.120]  We are living in a scientific dictatorship.
[00:34:34.090 --> 00:34:42.359]  And that's why it's so important that we reach out to people now, because we're now going into the depression.
[00:34:42.359 --> 00:34:44.481]  The time for denial is over.
[00:34:44.481 --> 00:34:49.086]  It is now admitted that we are living in a high-tech police state.
[00:34:49.086 --> 00:34:56.694]  It is now admitted that world government, a private corporate structure of global governance, is being established.
[00:34:58.459 --> 00:35:07.624]  How many callers do you hear who've had almost no success trying to wake friends and family up by talking to them, but they give them a copy of Road to Tyranny.
[00:35:07.624 --> 00:35:11.207]  They give them a copy of Endgame, Blueprint for Global Enslavement.
[00:35:11.207 --> 00:35:20.592]  They give them a copy of The Obama Deception, or Fall of the Republic, or Police State 4, The Rise of FEMA.
[00:35:20.592 --> 00:35:24.795]  Or Don't Tread on Me, Rise of the Republic.
[00:35:24.795 --> 00:35:26.736]  And it is waking them up.
[00:35:27.910 --> 00:35:35.543]  I'm going to your calls in a moment, but I want to encourage everyone to get our newest film, Invisible Empire, A New World Order Defined.
[00:35:37.520 --> 00:35:39.601]  This is the New World Order on trial.
[00:35:39.601 --> 00:35:45.524]  For the first time ever, the secret agenda of the planet's ruthless superclass is exposed in stark detail.
[00:35:45.524 --> 00:35:54.148]  This documentary film chronicles how men of power and influence have worked in stealth for centuries to establish an oppressive world government that is now here.
[00:35:54.148 --> 00:36:00.951]  Learn how this global oligarchy controls the populace through drug trafficking, money laundering, staged terror attacks, and media propaganda and debt.
[00:36:02.162 --> 00:36:09.769]  The criminal controllers have successfully dominated the globe and are now in the final phase of consolidating power over the individual itself.
[00:36:09.769 --> 00:36:14.373]  They are trying to reprogram and change what the human is inherently.
[00:36:14.373 --> 00:36:19.057]  They are trying to destroy human structures of family and community and language.
[00:36:19.994 --> 00:36:24.736]  Invisible Empire is a damning indictment of the globalists through their own words and documents.
[00:36:24.736 --> 00:36:27.777]  Worldwide tyranny isn't coming, it is here.
[00:36:27.777 --> 00:36:30.459]  This isn't conspiracy theory, it's conspiracy fact.
[00:36:30.459 --> 00:36:34.941]  The New World Order is out in the open, all documented in stunning living color.
[00:36:34.941 --> 00:36:39.943]  Unelected bureaucrats are establishing regional unions under one super state.
[00:36:39.943 --> 00:36:47.246]  Witness their plan for a global tax and a cashless surveillance society in which every man, woman, and child is microchipped at birth.
[00:36:49.707 --> 00:36:52.968]  The bonus features are Peter Dale Scott interview and the G20 protest.
[00:36:52.968 --> 00:36:55.629]  It's over three hours of material.
[00:36:55.629 --> 00:36:56.309]  $19.95.
[00:36:56.309 --> 00:36:59.690]  You can also get it discounted when you get it with some of the other films.
[00:36:59.690 --> 00:37:03.952]  Invisible Empire available at Infowars.com.
[00:37:03.952 --> 00:37:10.914]  And for a limited time, because when the group of books we bought sells out, we're still going to carry it, but we're not going to order as many.
[00:37:12.315 --> 00:37:17.136]  So we won't have a discount on them for ourselves, we can't pass that on to you.
[00:37:17.136 --> 00:37:22.458]  So we'll still be carrying it, it's just that it won't be massively discounted.
[00:37:22.458 --> 00:37:28.559]  Right now it's roughly about 20% off, instead of $24.95, it's $19.95.
[00:37:28.559 --> 00:37:32.520]  And then you get a free film, one of my films, for free.
[00:37:32.520 --> 00:37:35.221]  One of my films, and there's quite a few to choose from, free.
[00:37:36.061 --> 00:37:40.224]  When you get Jesse Ventura's American Conspiracies, New York Times Best Seller.
[00:37:40.224 --> 00:37:42.706]  It's a really great read, great to give folks.
[00:37:42.706 --> 00:37:44.107]  Very handsome cover.
[00:37:44.107 --> 00:37:45.368]  Covers a lot of key subjects.
[00:37:45.368 --> 00:37:50.813]  You can get that book discounted and get a free film of your choice at InfoWars.com.
[00:37:50.813 --> 00:37:52.254]  Or you can also call toll free 888-253-3139.
[00:37:52.254 --> 00:37:52.734]  That's 888-253-3139.
[00:37:52.734 --> 00:37:57.017]  They can answer your questions there and tell you about some of the combos and specials.
[00:38:02.296 --> 00:38:03.797]  You can also write to us at P.O.
[00:38:03.797 --> 00:38:05.118]  Box 19549.
[00:38:05.118 --> 00:38:06.279]  That's P.O.
[00:38:06.279 --> 00:38:11.122]  Box 19549, Austin, Texas, 78760.
[00:38:11.122 --> 00:38:17.126]  And your purchase of the books, the t-shirts, the materials, it makes this entire broadcast, what we do here, possible.
[00:38:17.126 --> 00:38:21.029]  But even more importantly, the public is now ready to be woken up.
[00:38:21.029 --> 00:38:22.170]  They know something's wrong.
[00:38:23.123 --> 00:38:35.545]  And the globalists think they're so dumb that the media, the controlled corporate media is up there saying, oh, the bankers, the geniuses that sold you all the derivatives and caused all this, but they leave that part out.
[00:38:35.545 --> 00:38:38.526]  They've got a carbon tax, that'll get your economy going.
[00:38:38.526 --> 00:38:42.887]  Selective taxes on Europe and the United States and Canada only.
[00:38:42.887 --> 00:38:50.548]  Australia, New Zealand, Western civilization, the engine of liberty, the engine of wealth, the engine of creativity, the main enemy of the globalists.
[00:38:52.034 --> 00:38:54.836]  Anybody that can rub two pennies together is their enemy.
[00:38:54.836 --> 00:39:02.600]  Anybody not living in a mud hut where they can just hire a local thug group to go in and forcibly sterilize them or just line them up and shoot them.
[00:39:02.600 --> 00:39:09.924]  See, they like to have you where they can fly over in their helicopters and you're in a mud hut and your kids are dying of dysentery.
[00:39:09.924 --> 00:39:11.405]  And they're going to get you where they want you.
[00:39:12.279 --> 00:39:12.960]  They're able to.
[00:39:12.960 --> 00:39:14.683]  This is scum.
[00:39:14.683 --> 00:39:16.486]  They use poverty as a weapon.
[00:39:16.486 --> 00:39:18.028]  Alright, I'm ranting.
[00:39:18.028 --> 00:39:21.013]  The point is, we better expose these terrorists now.
[00:39:21.013 --> 00:39:27.263]  These social engineer, smiley face criminal control freaks that use anthropology, sociology.
[00:39:30.083 --> 00:39:31.503]  to dominate us.
[00:39:31.503 --> 00:39:33.304]  I don't want to be socially engineered.
[00:39:33.304 --> 00:39:34.744]  I'm aware of their operation.
[00:39:34.744 --> 00:39:36.124]  I'm not disillusioned.
[00:39:36.124 --> 00:39:39.225]  I'm not dumbfounded and bamboozled and under a spell.
[00:39:39.225 --> 00:39:42.566]  We've got to wake up these other zombies and get them out of the Matrix now!
[00:39:42.566 --> 00:39:43.526]  Red alert!
[00:39:43.526 --> 00:39:45.447]  Red alert!
[00:39:45.447 --> 00:39:47.347]  And the films, they're the best tool out there.
[00:39:47.347 --> 00:39:50.248]  People ask me, you know, you'll wake up.
[00:39:50.248 --> 00:39:54.369]  Waking people up is the first move.
[00:39:54.369 --> 00:39:56.009]  And you're seeing the effect of that.
[00:39:58.408 --> 00:40:10.492]  Every week they have off-year elections or special elections or primaries that are going on right now because they're staggered in different states, as you know.
[00:40:10.492 --> 00:40:19.034]  And the Patriot candidates, the anti-New World Order candidates, the anti-incumbent type individuals are winning.
[00:40:19.034 --> 00:40:21.235]  They can have $5,000 or $50,000 up against people with $3,000 or $4,000 or $5,000,000 and they're winning.
[00:40:26.547 --> 00:40:31.211]  When the media demonizes somebody, the general public says they must be good.
[00:40:31.211 --> 00:40:35.614]  The system is in trouble, and they're moving to dominate us right now.
[00:40:35.614 --> 00:40:41.319]  And I know you know that as listeners, and that's why this show is so effective and why it's feared by the New World Order.
[00:40:41.319 --> 00:40:44.761]  But I'm telling you, we gotta up our games, all of us, right now.
[00:40:44.761 --> 00:40:46.643]  We gotta get really aggressive with these people.
[00:40:48.188 --> 00:40:49.329]  That means banner hangs.
[00:40:49.329 --> 00:40:50.850]  That means bullhorning City Hall.
[00:40:50.850 --> 00:40:57.695]  That means going and speaking in Citizens Communications, in the Telecommunications Commission, or the Water District, or the School District.
[00:40:57.695 --> 00:41:01.057]  Bring up whatever issues you want.
[00:41:01.057 --> 00:41:02.078]  Just state the facts.
[00:41:04.093 --> 00:41:07.554]  Because our society is being collapsed by design.
[00:41:07.554 --> 00:41:09.854]  It is only going to get worse from here.
[00:41:09.854 --> 00:41:21.817]  And they intend to use the crisis to fully domesticate us, to fully bankrupt us, and to sick the giant hordes of starving people on the tiny middle class that's left.
[00:41:21.817 --> 00:41:28.358]  They're going to tell poor people that somebody living in a half million dollar house who's got a bank account is the rich.
[00:41:28.358 --> 00:41:31.699]  And they're going to shake down whatever's left of the middle class.
[00:41:31.699 --> 00:41:33.619]  It's the middle class that goes to the cleaners.
[00:41:34.844 --> 00:41:36.626]  It's the middle class that goes to the restaurants.
[00:41:36.626 --> 00:41:38.849]  It's the middle class that goes in your boutique.
[00:41:38.849 --> 00:41:42.154]  It's the middle class that owns businesses that give you jobs.
[00:41:42.154 --> 00:41:46.500]  And the globalists want to shut them down, just like they've shut the factories down and everything else.
[00:41:49.654 --> 00:41:54.935]  And the ruling elite are going to use the giant, poor, starving masses as a weapon.
[00:41:54.935 --> 00:42:02.777]  We have got to reach out to those people now, before they're bankrupt, and explain to them why they're about to be bankrupt.
[00:42:02.777 --> 00:42:06.817]  Why they're about to be laid off if they haven't already been laid off.
[00:42:06.817 --> 00:42:09.358]  We've got to explain to them now, okay?
[00:42:09.358 --> 00:42:14.459]  It's only going to get worse and get tougher and become an uphill battle if we don't supercharge now.
[00:42:14.459 --> 00:42:17.640]  This is an emergency situation.
[00:42:17.640 --> 00:42:18.400]  Alright, let's talk to
[00:42:19.962 --> 00:42:21.497]  Adam in Missouri, you're on the air, go ahead.
[00:42:22.698 --> 00:42:25.258]  Yeah, thanks for taking my call.
[00:42:25.258 --> 00:42:37.561]  Speaking of getting the word out, what I want to do is put a video on YouTube, and I just wanted to ask to see your opinion and your take on what's allowed to be used and not allowed to be used.
[00:42:37.561 --> 00:42:46.922]  I want to use, like, news clips, clips that you had from your radio show, clips from your movies, Burmese's movies, Stills' movies, Ike's, you know, you name it.
[00:42:46.922 --> 00:42:49.903]  I don't know what's permissible or not.
[00:42:49.903 --> 00:42:51.163]  Adam, listen.
[00:42:52.343 --> 00:43:04.073]  Number one, it's all a gray area, and it's taken me 15 years of studying this to even have a basic understanding of it.
[00:43:04.073 --> 00:43:12.820]  But you could shoot a video of yourself talking on your front lawn, and if somebody doesn't like it, they'll go file fake complaints.
[00:43:12.820 --> 00:43:15.783]  And then what you've got to do is file through YouTube a counter.
[00:43:16.543 --> 00:43:17.445]  Uh, but it doesn't matter.
[00:43:17.445 --> 00:43:18.506]  They shut down your channel.
[00:43:18.506 --> 00:43:19.888]  Just go start another one.
[00:43:19.888 --> 00:43:28.078]  But as long as you're using small clips of something, people email me all the time and say, can I have your permission to hand out bumper stickers with Infowars.com on it?
[00:43:28.078 --> 00:43:30.482]  Or can I have your permission to link to you on my website?
[00:43:30.482 --> 00:43:32.624]  You don't need permission to do that.
[00:43:32.624 --> 00:43:34.206]  You don't need permission to do any of it.
[00:43:34.907 --> 00:43:46.251]  What you need permission to do is to make copies of my films in whole and sell them and no one has permission to do that because I'd have to give you my copyright and I would lose control of my films.
[00:43:46.251 --> 00:43:54.114]  But I do authorize people to make copies of all my films and all my work and to give them to people for non-profit educational purposes.
[00:43:54.114 --> 00:43:55.595]  I appreciate your call, Adam.
[00:43:55.595 --> 00:43:57.176]  But I mean, I wouldn't wait.
[00:43:57.176 --> 00:43:58.216]  Everything's collapsing.
[00:43:59.502 --> 00:44:06.807]  So of course you can use clips from news to point out what you're saying and then mix it in with things I've said and mix it in with whatever you want.
[00:44:06.807 --> 00:44:08.208]  That's what the news does.
[00:44:08.208 --> 00:44:18.915]  You don't think Fox News and CNN ask permission from me whenever they show a clip of my show on CNN, which they've done, I don't know, 10, 15 times that I've seen in the last year.
[00:44:18.915 --> 00:44:20.656]  No, because it's a short clip.
[00:44:20.656 --> 00:44:28.742]  When CNN shows 10 seconds of me torturing an iPad to death to illustrate that people care more about things and machines than they do people,
[00:44:30.334 --> 00:44:33.761]  They didn't ask permission.
[00:44:33.761 --> 00:44:34.021]  Okay?
[00:44:34.021 --> 00:44:35.444]  Because it's a small clip.
[00:44:35.444 --> 00:44:37.828]  They're showing it.
[00:44:37.828 --> 00:44:40.213]  And so, knock yourself out, Adam.
[00:44:40.213 --> 00:44:42.016]  Catherine in Maryland, you're on the air.
[00:44:42.016 --> 00:44:42.316]  Welcome.
[00:44:43.080 --> 00:44:44.421]  Hi, Alex.
[00:44:44.421 --> 00:44:46.822]  Thank you for taking my call.
[00:44:46.822 --> 00:44:53.646]  Listen, speaking of red alerts, I need to speak with you about something that I got really worried about yesterday.
[00:44:53.646 --> 00:44:57.608]  I was online, and I'm aware of everything.
[00:44:57.608 --> 00:45:05.213]  I watch you on YouTube, and I'm aware of everything that's going on, but what I wasn't aware of was the harp powers and the chemtrails, okay?
[00:45:05.213 --> 00:45:07.554]  And I saw these on YouTube in a video.
[00:45:09.495 --> 00:45:10.896]  And then I looked into it further.
[00:45:10.896 --> 00:45:17.519]  I YouTubed these individually in one of your Chemtrail videos, I believe it was produced by you.
[00:45:17.519 --> 00:45:27.604]  I didn't know what they were, so then later on, ironically, later on that night, I looked at the weather channel online because I always check the local weather, you know.
[00:45:27.604 --> 00:45:28.745]  Typed in my zip code, 21811.
[00:45:28.745 --> 00:45:29.545]  I saw an orange alert.
[00:45:33.368 --> 00:45:34.849]  Okay, for air quality.
[00:45:34.849 --> 00:45:36.569]  And I've never seen this in 25 years.
[00:45:36.569 --> 00:45:38.890]  I've never seen any kind of air quality alert.
[00:45:38.890 --> 00:45:40.411]  I've seen high pollen.
[00:45:40.411 --> 00:45:41.431]  I've seen heat advisers.
[00:45:41.431 --> 00:45:45.373]  They're fear-mongering you to sell new taxes.
[00:45:45.373 --> 00:45:57.658]  I mean, in the middle of the countryside, they have ozone alerts, when ozone actually, at many levels, from what I've read, actually is a cleansing agent and is naturally occurring.
[00:45:57.658 --> 00:45:59.378]  It's just all part of fear-mongering.
[00:45:59.378 --> 00:46:02.340]  I mean, they've convinced schoolchildren that carbon
[00:46:03.607 --> 00:46:06.630]  Dioxide that plants breathe is a deadly poison.
[00:46:06.630 --> 00:46:07.971]  But go ahead.
[00:46:07.971 --> 00:46:11.593]  Yeah, and I don't buy any of the global warming hype.
[00:46:11.593 --> 00:46:15.036]  It's just all a way for them to rape you and take control of your life.
[00:46:15.036 --> 00:46:16.557]  Exactly, yes.
[00:46:16.557 --> 00:46:24.944]  But what I was saying was that when I looked into the chemtrails and stuff like that, and I looked at it, it says, what are the most polluted U.S.
[00:46:24.944 --> 00:46:25.724]  cities?
[00:46:25.724 --> 00:46:28.927]  And it's all in California, Texas, Detroit.
[00:46:29.409 --> 00:46:32.336]  And all those heavily populated industrialized cities.
[00:46:32.336 --> 00:46:37.508]  And then when you look at the red alert and the orange alert, it's all here up here in the northeast.
[00:46:38.604 --> 00:46:40.825]  In Maryland, right here on the Eastern Shore, it's very warm.
[00:46:40.825 --> 00:46:50.010]  Well, that's because when you've got really hot temperatures, pockets of ozone and other things supposedly can pool down at ground level.
[00:46:50.010 --> 00:46:53.211]  And it's just, it's total fear-mongering.
[00:46:53.211 --> 00:46:59.795]  This is a government that by design has authorized GMO crops that no one else is allowed to eat worldwide.
[00:46:59.795 --> 00:47:01.255]  I mean, it's banned everywhere.
[00:47:01.255 --> 00:47:07.759]  That they know sterilizes and attacks the kidneys and other organs of every rodent species they feed it to.
[00:47:08.359 --> 00:47:11.480]  And they know in the clinical trials it's hurting humans.
[00:47:11.480 --> 00:47:23.025]  I mean, this is a government that puts hundreds of deadly chemicals by design, on purpose, in the water, and then they tell you, oh my gosh, ozone action day, we're all dead, it's hot.
[00:47:23.025 --> 00:47:28.428]  It's just total fear-mongering for new emissions tests, new taxes, Catherine, but I appreciate your call.
[00:47:29.918 --> 00:47:32.800]  Yes, there's weather modification going on everywhere.
[00:47:32.800 --> 00:47:46.611]  Yes, they do have hundreds and hundreds of tower arrays, not just in Alaska, not just in Northern Europe, not just in Sweden and other areas and Russia, but also in the continental United States.
[00:47:46.611 --> 00:47:53.237]  There are all sorts of Air Force bases and other facilities that are classified where they are manipulating the weather.
[00:47:54.127 --> 00:48:01.973]  Because the fact that these programs are going on has been declassified thousands of times in thousands of different documents.
[00:48:01.973 --> 00:48:06.256]  But the specifics are classified of what exactly they're doing.
[00:48:06.256 --> 00:48:14.603]  And the old timers 15 years ago said, it's barium salts, it's aluminum dioxide, they're mixing it with the jet fuel so it's compartmentalized and dispersed.
[00:48:14.603 --> 00:48:16.244]  Even the airlines don't know what's going on.
[00:48:16.244 --> 00:48:19.046]  It's done at the supplier of jet fuel level.
[00:48:19.046 --> 00:48:20.588]  Now we have those government documents.
[00:48:20.588 --> 00:48:21.809]  Now we have the government patents.
[00:48:22.369 --> 00:48:24.732]  I mean, it's just all hidden in plain view.
[00:48:24.732 --> 00:48:28.776]  Just like taking baby's blood at birth for a Pentagon database is hidden in plain view.
[00:48:28.776 --> 00:48:39.408]  Just like microphones in every major town and city listening to you, piped into the NSA with keyword software, scanning everything you're saying, is hidden in plain view now.
[00:48:39.408 --> 00:48:41.590]  It's all right out in the open.
[00:48:41.590 --> 00:48:43.312]  That is what's so hellish about this.
[00:48:44.293 --> 00:48:50.378]  And they know that psychologically most people don't have the courage to face up to what's even admitted.
[00:48:50.378 --> 00:48:57.303]  And so that people just go into a catatonic state and say, look, I choose to only care about football and sex and drinking.
[00:48:57.303 --> 00:49:00.346]  And then a lot of people look at the facts and say, you know what?
[00:49:00.346 --> 00:49:01.546]  I'm going to go party.
[00:49:01.546 --> 00:49:02.727]  I don't care about my kids.
[00:49:02.727 --> 00:49:04.329]  I don't care about my family.
[00:49:04.329 --> 00:49:05.490]  I'm going to go along with this.
[00:49:05.490 --> 00:49:08.472]  And they make the decision to just to just make a joke about it.
[00:49:09.898 --> 00:49:15.400]  And more and more people are deciding to make that choice, but also many others.
[00:49:15.400 --> 00:49:16.760]  There's a separation happening.
[00:49:16.760 --> 00:49:26.963]  People are getting deeper into brainwashing, deeper into accepting the lie, deeper into rationalizing, and they'll accept anything now.
[00:49:26.963 --> 00:49:29.304]  They'll accept torture, secret arrest, you name it.
[00:49:30.319 --> 00:49:33.220]  They'll watch their neighbor's kids drug away.
[00:49:33.220 --> 00:49:35.761]  They'll watch newborn babies taken for no reason.
[00:49:35.761 --> 00:49:47.986]  And just like mainstream news in the US and England are now just going, okay, the government does have secret quotas, it is about money, and we are taking your children at birth for no reason, and that's just the way it is, what you gonna do about it?
[00:49:47.986 --> 00:49:52.707]  If you try to fight back, we'll just have SWAT teams come and kill you.
[00:49:52.707 --> 00:49:54.508]  It's just mafia now.
[00:49:54.508 --> 00:49:56.509]  Yeah, we're criminal, we're gonna do it.
[00:49:57.759 --> 00:50:07.124]  Just like they admit world government, just like they admit private banks are going to take everything over and raise your taxes, and that's just the way it is.
[00:50:07.124 --> 00:50:18.390]  Just like Obama comes out now and just openly says... I mean, last night I watched four or five different clips of CNN, MSNBC, and Fox with the reporters admitting in
[00:50:19.312 --> 00:50:30.595]  That they've got all the rock for the jetties to block the oil in the estuaries, and they know it's coming because of the hurricanes, and that the government, Obama, blocked them blocking the estuaries.
[00:50:30.595 --> 00:50:34.416]  He's just admitted it, and Obama's blocking the skimmer ships still.
[00:50:34.416 --> 00:50:36.097]  That's just the way it is.
[00:50:36.097 --> 00:50:38.278]  And he'll be hated.
[00:50:38.278 --> 00:50:39.398]  And then in
[00:50:44.636 --> 00:50:45.296]  This is not a drill.
[00:50:45.296 --> 00:50:46.697]  Repeat, this is not a drill.
[00:51:08.756 --> 00:51:15.983]  Gun prices are going through the roof and that means desperate, vicious criminals now want your guns and will do anything to get them.
[00:51:15.983 --> 00:51:20.367]  Now a new book reveals powerful secrets for hiding your guns from thieves and looters.
[00:51:20.367 --> 00:51:30.717]  You'll learn step-by-step, battle-hardened techniques, where to hide your guns so criminals will never find them, how to create the perfect hiding place, as well as the places you should never hide your guns.
[00:51:31.257 --> 00:51:31.737]  We're good to go!
[00:52:01.195 --> 00:52:03.578]  They helped to create a New World Order.
[00:52:03.578 --> 00:52:05.780]  We are part of a New World Order.
[00:52:05.780 --> 00:52:09.124]  A New World Order based upon collective action.
[00:52:09.124 --> 00:52:14.230]  Invisible Empire is a damning indictment of the globalists through their own words and documents.
[00:52:14.230 --> 00:52:18.415]  The New World Order really is a tool for addressing a new world of possibilities.
[00:52:18.715 --> 00:52:21.079]  It means all the world under their control.
[00:52:21.079 --> 00:52:23.963]  The United Nations would take over America.
[00:52:23.963 --> 00:52:26.867]  The Trilateral Commission would control the world.
[00:52:26.867 --> 00:52:34.479]  Invisible Empire chronicles how men of power and influence have worked in stealth for centuries to establish an oppressive world government.
[00:52:34.799 --> 00:52:40.201]  I believe first of all that we now need nothing short of a world constitution for the global financial system.
[00:52:40.201 --> 00:52:43.041]  Global governance with the establishment of the G20.
[00:52:43.041 --> 00:52:46.722]  So it's going to be an inner ruling elite and then everyone else.
[00:52:46.722 --> 00:52:47.823]  And I got news for you.
[00:52:47.823 --> 00:52:49.143]  You're everyone else.
[00:52:49.143 --> 00:52:50.644]  Invisible Empire.

[00:54:07.461 --> 00:54:13.266]  I've got a hammer at home over and over again.
[00:54:13.266 --> 00:54:18.390]  The establishment is so evil.
[00:54:18.390 --> 00:54:20.371]  They enjoy corruption.
[00:54:20.371 --> 00:54:23.674]  They enjoy abusing innocents.
[00:54:23.674 --> 00:54:30.740]  And they have been trying to acclimate and turn the police and military into sickos that have their taste.
[00:54:31.789 --> 00:54:40.131]  Torture of innocents, torture of children, secret arrest, beating people, lying, framing people.
[00:54:40.131 --> 00:54:53.634]  By every measurement, what the system is pushing here in the United States and in the West is classical hardcore corruption and tyranny.
[00:54:53.634 --> 00:54:57.595]  And we can't underestimate how much trouble we're in.
[00:54:57.595 --> 00:54:59.535]  People have got to really have it burn in that
[00:55:03.151 --> 00:55:06.273]  That we're not in Kansas anymore.
[00:55:06.273 --> 00:55:11.196]  And I'll say it again, I'll say it succinctly.
[00:55:11.196 --> 00:55:17.499]  Everything we've talked about here in the last decade has unfortunately come true or is coming true.
[00:55:17.499 --> 00:55:26.965]  And a decade in the scheme of human time is a flash in the pan, a twinkling of the eye.
[00:55:26.965 --> 00:55:28.906]  And things are moving so quickly now.
[00:55:30.202 --> 00:55:38.785]  But compared to the average person's time attention span, that's maybe five, 10 minutes, a decade seems like eons.
[00:55:38.785 --> 00:55:53.992]  And so, because we are in low attention span mode as a society, because television has conditioned us to be that way and other reasons, because we are a spectator society, we're just completely immobilized.
[00:55:53.992 --> 00:55:59.554]  We're just laying back and accepting all of this corruption going wild.
[00:56:00.646 --> 00:56:02.387]  We are in a depression.
[00:56:02.387 --> 00:56:04.888]  They are shutting down the state and local governments.
[00:56:04.888 --> 00:56:08.650]  Things are collapsing.
[00:56:08.650 --> 00:56:17.434]  I know it seems like slow motion to some of you out there, but the fact that we've been in a depression for two years, and most people I know have now been laid off.
[00:56:21.024 --> 00:56:25.367]  And every economic measurement shows we're in serious trouble.
[00:56:25.367 --> 00:56:30.029]  I mean, I'm not just saying depression up here because it's a fancy, scary word, folks.
[00:56:30.029 --> 00:56:31.390]  I'm freaked out.
[00:56:31.390 --> 00:56:32.851]  And we need to be freaked out.
[00:56:32.851 --> 00:56:35.533]  Because the crooks in Washington have designed this.
[00:56:35.533 --> 00:56:39.975]  Just like they're doing everything they can to block the oil coming in.
[00:56:39.975 --> 00:56:42.137]  And that isn't just words.
[00:56:42.137 --> 00:56:42.757]  It is 100% confirmed.
[00:56:45.779 --> 00:56:58.125]  That the federal government is still, almost 80 days into this, blocking sand berms and rock berms that would protect the estuaries.
[00:56:58.125 --> 00:56:59.026]  They're just doing it!
[00:57:00.731 --> 00:57:15.865]  Now you watch, once the oil comes ashore, they're gonna flutter around down there like a beehive that's been hit with a baseball bat, and you know, the feds will go around and tell everybody that, you know, thank God they're there to fix the crisis that they have exacerbated.
[00:57:15.865 --> 00:57:17.467]  I mean, this is treason!
[00:57:19.264 --> 00:57:26.309]  And they're setting the precedent that A, you're not allowed to help yourself, and that B, they're not gonna help you either.
[00:57:26.309 --> 00:57:34.114]  I mean, since when could hundreds of thousands of people stuck in New Orleans not walk out on the highways?
[00:57:34.114 --> 00:57:38.577]  The highways were above the water from any point in the city.
[00:57:38.577 --> 00:57:42.480]  The population was blocked in by police with guns.
[00:57:42.480 --> 00:57:42.960]  And you know what?
[00:57:42.960 --> 00:57:44.381]  The American people passed the test.
[00:57:45.984 --> 00:57:49.086]  The American people cowered and didn't push their way past the cops.
[00:57:49.086 --> 00:57:54.129]  Those cops were involved in crimes against humanity.
[00:57:54.129 --> 00:57:59.372]  And when the public did try to push by, they machine-gunned them under federal orders.
[00:57:59.372 --> 00:58:02.934]  And then you notice the cops sent the police to prison.
[00:58:02.934 --> 00:58:03.915]  Federal charges!
[00:58:06.343 --> 00:58:18.291]  Just like you follow orders at Abu Ghraib or Camp X-ray to torture, and then it comes out, you go to prison, and the former president gives speeches about how he ordered the torture, and now he's proud of it.
[00:58:18.291 --> 00:58:21.914]  This is all a modus operandi.
[00:58:21.914 --> 00:58:24.756]  This is a wavelength, a signature.
[00:58:24.756 --> 00:58:26.297]  This is a policy.
[00:58:26.297 --> 00:58:27.818]  This is a tropism.
[00:58:27.818 --> 00:58:31.140]  This is how the globalists do it.
[00:58:31.140 --> 00:58:35.363]  This is their mode of getting things done.
[00:58:37.418 --> 00:58:42.688]  And they're going to do the same thing with the oil.
[00:58:42.688 --> 00:58:45.313]  Thank you for listening to GCN.

[01:00:06.903 --> 01:00:08.665]  Mainstream media.
[01:00:08.665 --> 01:00:10.447]  Government cover-ups.
[01:00:10.447 --> 01:00:12.028]  You want answers?
[01:00:12.028 --> 01:00:13.590]  Well, so does he.

[01:00:17.774 --> 01:00:21.838]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:30.199 --> 01:00:30.899]  We're back live.
[01:00:30.899 --> 01:00:31.980]  It's hour number two.
[01:00:31.980 --> 01:00:38.805]  Open phones in this short segment and throughout the hour, Mike Rivero, syndicated radio host and runs WhatReallyHappened.com.
[01:00:38.805 --> 01:00:46.270]  He'll be joining us to give us his take on the oil spill, on the economy and so much more.
[01:00:46.270 --> 01:00:48.632]  We're going to go simulcast at PrisonPlanet.TV.
[01:00:48.632 --> 01:00:58.478]  We're going to start simulcasting the radio show here in about seven minutes when we come back in the second segment for PrisonPlanet.TV viewers.
[01:00:58.478 --> 01:00:59.159]  Let's talk to
[01:01:01.306 --> 01:01:02.547]  Alec in Texas.
[01:01:02.547 --> 01:01:05.029]  You're on the air, Alec.
[01:01:05.029 --> 01:01:05.690]  Hello.
[01:01:05.690 --> 01:01:07.171]  Hey, buddy.
[01:01:07.171 --> 01:01:14.356]  I took the red pill a long time ago, and I'm a Prison Planet member.
[01:01:14.356 --> 01:01:17.419]  I buy your DVDs and spread them around.
[01:01:17.419 --> 01:01:17.779]  Thank you.
[01:01:17.779 --> 01:01:18.760]  I couldn't operate without it.
[01:01:18.760 --> 01:01:20.241]  Go ahead.
[01:01:20.241 --> 01:01:26.406]  I have a question for you, and it'll take me a minute to frame this question.
[01:01:26.406 --> 01:01:27.247]  It seems like the
[01:01:28.888 --> 01:01:57.771]  banking or financial cartel that is destroying our society uh... is out of the what we might call the anglo-american dutch empire i mean they're sort of headquartered in uh... this empire which has had uh... a great deal of power in the world for a couple hundred years and uh... i would suggest that the source of their power has been uh... the fact that
[01:01:59.575 --> 01:02:06.138]  These countries that make up this empire have traditionally been very strong.
[01:02:06.138 --> 01:02:06.999]  They've been healthy.
[01:02:06.999 --> 01:02:08.419]  They've had liberty.
[01:02:08.419 --> 01:02:11.140]  They've had excellent education.
[01:02:11.140 --> 01:02:24.767]  Yes, England and of course the Dutch have been very free and the United States compared to others, not perfect, have been the freest in the world and so incredible wealth was produced and the populations are very warlike, very tough.
[01:02:25.727 --> 01:02:27.109]  And very smart.
[01:02:27.109 --> 01:02:41.105]  And so, of course, the powerful elites and the banking cartels that were able to covertly, at a corporate level, take over our three nations have now set up the world government.
[01:02:41.105 --> 01:02:43.408]  And that's very well said.
[01:02:43.408 --> 01:02:46.071]  And they've now made the decision to fully gut us.
[01:02:47.093 --> 01:02:48.835]  Well, here's my question.
[01:02:48.835 --> 01:02:52.778]  It seems to me that they are destroying their own power base.
[01:02:52.778 --> 01:03:02.867]  Because once they've destroyed our society, our health, our education, our patriotism, our national identities, who's going to look out after them?
[01:03:02.867 --> 01:03:04.489]  Because they're in the endgame!
[01:03:05.134 --> 01:03:06.976]  They're in the endgame.
[01:03:06.976 --> 01:03:14.042]  They've got to have a worldwide police state be clamped down, in their own words, so they can carry out the mass extermination.
[01:03:14.042 --> 01:03:23.732]  It's going to slowly go from, let's say on your street you've got 20 neighbors you know and five of them have got cancer, to half the neighborhood dies of cancer in a five-year period.
[01:03:24.212 --> 01:03:28.473]  You know, everyone you know, almost everyone will have kidney failure.
[01:03:28.473 --> 01:03:30.774]  Almost everyone you know will have diabetes.
[01:03:30.774 --> 01:03:34.636]  Almost everyone you know, and they'll be like, oh, it's the unhealthy lifestyle.
[01:03:34.636 --> 01:03:36.396]  No, it's the GMO.
[01:03:36.396 --> 01:03:43.078]  It's the chemical weapons in the hamburgers, in the fries, in the nuggets.
[01:03:43.078 --> 01:03:44.519]  I mean, it's silicon.
[01:03:44.519 --> 01:03:45.559]  They know.
[01:03:45.559 --> 01:03:50.341]  And they've just been testing their soft kills quietly in the background.
[01:03:50.341 --> 01:03:53.002]  Only eight of the major foods
[01:03:54.062 --> 01:03:57.104]  Crops right now are GMO.
[01:03:57.104 --> 01:04:00.946]  Every one of them sterilizes every rodent species that is fed it.
[01:04:00.946 --> 01:04:03.627]  And of course they test on rodents because they're very similar to us.
[01:04:03.627 --> 01:04:07.489]  And all the studies show our birth weights are down, fertility's way down.
[01:04:07.489 --> 01:04:09.190]  We're getting soft killed right now.
[01:04:09.190 --> 01:04:12.231]  It's slow, degenerative weapon system.
[01:04:12.231 --> 01:04:18.555]  Okay, and then they have treatments that prop us up and suck all the money out of us before we die that then extend life.
[01:04:19.215 --> 01:04:24.078]  But, and then if you take out the averages, because people always counter with, well, what do you mean?
[01:04:24.078 --> 01:04:25.118]  We live longer now.
[01:04:25.118 --> 01:04:29.221]  Not if you take out infant mortality from the 20s and 30s, which was higher then.
[01:04:29.221 --> 01:04:33.103]  You take those numbers out, we have a lower life expectancy.
[01:04:33.103 --> 01:04:34.184]  And so it's done.
[01:04:34.184 --> 01:04:39.086]  Anyone, this is eugenics.
[01:04:39.086 --> 01:04:43.249]  They want to kill the third world people just as much as they want to kill us.
[01:04:43.249 --> 01:04:46.531]  But they've got to get us out of the way so we don't bring them to justice.
[01:04:47.728 --> 01:04:54.839]  You see, if we are ever able to take control of the empire again, they're going to be in a lot of trouble.
[01:04:54.839 --> 01:04:58.724]  So they're just going to chemically lobotomize us where we can't stand up against them.
[01:04:58.724 --> 01:04:59.586]  And that's going on now.
[01:05:01.584 --> 01:05:08.027]  The Fall of America and the Western World is an all-new 10-hour documentary and survival guide rolled into one.

[01:06:59.707 --> 01:07:02.108]  They helped to create a New World Order.
[01:07:02.108 --> 01:07:04.409]  We are part of a New World Order.
[01:07:04.409 --> 01:07:07.610]  A New World Order based upon collective action.
[01:07:07.610 --> 01:07:12.732]  Invisible Empire is a damning indictment of the globalists through their own words and documents.
[01:07:12.732 --> 01:07:16.913]  The New World Order really is a tool for addressing a new world of possibilities.
[01:07:17.233 --> 01:07:19.696]  It means all the world under their control.
[01:07:19.696 --> 01:07:22.479]  The United Nations would take over America.
[01:07:22.479 --> 01:07:25.382]  The Trilateral Commission would control the world.
[01:07:25.382 --> 01:07:32.991]  Invisible Empire chronicles how men of power and influence have worked in stealth for centuries to establish an oppressive world government.
[01:07:33.331 --> 01:07:38.716]  I believe first of all that we now need nothing short of a world constitution for the global financial system.
[01:07:38.716 --> 01:07:41.558]  Global governance with the establishment of the G20.
[01:07:41.558 --> 01:07:45.261]  So it's going to be an inner ruling elite and then everyone else.
[01:07:45.261 --> 01:07:46.322]  And I got news for you.
[01:07:46.322 --> 01:07:47.663]  You're everyone else.

[01:08:04.320 --> 01:08:07.123]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:08:11.670 --> 01:08:21.235]  We're live at PrisonPlanet.tv simulcasting the last three hours of the radio show In Living Color at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:08:21.235 --> 01:08:26.097]  Mike Rivero joining us from Hawaii via video Skype here in just a moment.
[01:08:26.097 --> 01:08:26.918]  Thank you for joining us.
[01:08:26.918 --> 01:08:28.699]  We'll talk about a host of issues with him.
[01:08:28.699 --> 01:08:30.359]  But here's a report.
[01:08:30.359 --> 01:08:30.700]  U.S.
[01:08:30.700 --> 01:08:33.021]  warships cause anger in Costa Rica.
[01:08:33.871 --> 01:08:39.893]  This is all over the Latin American news, all over the European news, but very little news here in the United States.
[01:08:39.893 --> 01:08:41.833]  Costa Rica has allowed 46 U.S.
[01:08:41.833 --> 01:08:49.376]  warships, 7,000 Marines to enter the country despite objections by the opposition parties which describe the move as illegal.
[01:08:49.376 --> 01:08:56.698]  Costa Rican opposition parties denounced the decision of legislative assembly describing it as illegal in violation of national sovereignty.
[01:08:57.999 --> 01:09:03.324]  And it goes on that they're going to be engaged basically in combat operations fighting drug traffickers.
[01:09:03.324 --> 01:09:06.747]  That means people that haven't laundered their money through the U.S.
[01:09:06.747 --> 01:09:07.888]  banks.
[01:09:07.888 --> 01:09:08.789]  Incredible.
[01:09:08.789 --> 01:09:12.612]  Now let's dovetail that with some background.
[01:09:12.612 --> 01:09:15.815]  Christina Farrars, if I'm pronouncing that correctly,
[01:09:19.899 --> 01:09:29.902]  Give me a document cam shot.
[01:09:29.902 --> 01:09:36.083]  I want to show people an image of this steely-eyed, wicked woman.
[01:09:36.083 --> 01:09:42.505]  And there's the lady that's going to help worldwide bring total tyranny in and put taxes on what humans exhale.
[01:09:42.505 --> 01:09:48.446]  And then if you notice, her father was President José Ferrer.
[01:09:50.876 --> 01:10:14.393]  of Costa Rica abolished the military of Costa Rica after the victory of the Civil War that year because he didn't want to have a group to overthrow him in a ceremony in the main government facility and it goes on to talk about how they got rid of their military.
[01:10:16.550 --> 01:10:18.593]  I mean, this is insane, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:10:18.593 --> 01:10:21.817]  Our country has been taken over by foreign corporations.
[01:10:21.817 --> 01:10:26.602]  We are being overthrown, just like a third world country, and looted and robbed.
[01:10:26.602 --> 01:10:29.266]  And we must stand up and say no to it.
[01:10:29.266 --> 01:10:32.470]  Now, going to Mike Rivero, joining us.
[01:10:32.470 --> 01:10:33.891]  Of course, he runs WhatReallyHappened.com.
[01:10:35.293 --> 01:10:35.653]  We're good to go.
[01:10:52.912 --> 01:10:53.192]  I don't know.
[01:11:14.543 --> 01:11:33.088]  And Obama's approval rating has fallen even further, and of course that's his job, to be built up as a messianic savior, then to be destroyed, and a new puppet comes in, but why does the establishment want that oil to come ashore when the hurricane season kicks in here in the next month?
[01:11:33.088 --> 01:11:34.208]  Mike, what's your take on this?
[01:11:35.245 --> 01:11:51.449]  I'm not so sure that they want the oil to come ashore so much as we're dealing with governmental arrogance and I like to call this disaster America's Chernobyl and if you go back and you look at the Soviet Union's response when the reactor blew up for the first
[01:11:51.989 --> 01:11:55.410]  Several weeks there, they kept saying, no, no, we got it taken care of.
[01:11:55.410 --> 01:11:57.111]  We don't need any help.
[01:11:57.111 --> 01:12:04.314]  It was seen as a political negative to admit the situation was so out of control that they needed help from other countries.
[01:12:04.314 --> 01:12:15.278]  There is another aspect in that if you look at the specific methodologies that are being chosen to deal with this catastrophe, all of them are based on BP's desire to somehow corral up the oil
[01:12:15.698 --> 01:12:16.460]  We're good to go.
[01:12:32.102 --> 01:12:43.045]  We know the company that makes that is partly owned by Goldman Sachs, so it's all being driven by money and greed and an attempt to minimize the losses and somehow salvage the oil for resale.
[01:12:43.045 --> 01:12:45.065]  And the rest of it is just saving face.
[01:12:45.065 --> 01:12:48.506]  There have been so many things that were done wrong during this whole operation.
[01:12:48.506 --> 01:13:00.169]  I think one of the reasons they don't want any outsiders coming in from anywhere is that once the outsiders see how bad things are, it's going to go public around the world just how completely this was messed up from day one.
[01:13:01.021 --> 01:13:19.324]  Well Mike, I agree with you that the bureaucracy, not just of government, but of BP, slows everything down because everything BP does has to be about some business partner or subsidiary, like Goldman Sachs, where just a year ago
[01:13:20.313 --> 01:13:26.255]  The chairman of Goldman Sachs, as you know, but for some out there that may not, was also the head of BP.
[01:13:26.255 --> 01:13:29.517]  So these are Siamese twins we're talking about.
[01:13:29.517 --> 01:13:34.379]  And BP, it's come out, is paying its subsidiaries to do the cleanup.
[01:13:34.379 --> 01:13:36.920]  So they're saying, oh, we've spent $3 billion here.
[01:13:38.732 --> 01:13:38.972]  We're good
[01:13:56.758 --> 01:13:57.058]  Take a look.
[01:14:16.043 --> 01:14:21.749]  Uh, the counties and the cities and the states, and I don't have to go over the instances of this.
[01:14:21.749 --> 01:14:23.130]  Everybody's seen it on the news.
[01:14:23.130 --> 01:14:39.486]  Just last night, I watched Anderson Cooper, and they had reporters there with giant mountains of rock that are there to block up the estuaries and save, you know, for those that don't know, Louisiana is like a maze of rivers and marshes and literally tens of thousands of square miles.
[01:14:40.447 --> 01:14:41.288]  Of course not.
[01:15:00.154 --> 01:15:15.348]  Well, I think they're partly oblivious, but there is another agenda behind here, because over the weekend there was an announcement that the Environmental Protection Agency was forcing a whole bunch of Texas refineries to refile their environmental impact paperwork.
[01:15:15.348 --> 01:15:21.173]  There'd been this program in place for about 16 years, under which the refineries were operating.
[01:15:21.693 --> 01:15:23.194]  And the EPA just cancelled it.
[01:15:23.194 --> 01:15:30.577]  So now all the refineries have to halt operations while they go through that whole paperwork process of getting a new license to operate.
[01:15:30.577 --> 01:15:39.581]  Now remember, just before the Deepwater Horizon exploded, the Obama administration was handing out waivers and exemptions for EPA requirements to all those gulf drilling platforms.
[01:15:40.001 --> 01:15:54.586]  So, there's one theory going on here that Obama is using this disaster to trigger an oil crisis and an oil price crisis as a means of blackmailing his cap and credit tax through Congress and through the American people.
[01:15:54.586 --> 01:15:56.227]  I mean, today you're seeing the headlines.
[01:15:56.227 --> 01:16:00.768]  They're talking about, oh, there's a heat wave in New England and it's not just hot, it's dangerous.
[01:16:00.768 --> 01:16:05.590]  They're trying to scare us back into that cap and credit tax situation because without that new tax,
[01:16:05.970 --> 01:16:08.072]  The federal government is running out of money.
[01:16:08.072 --> 01:16:14.818]  And so I think it's just like the way Obama is using the immigration crisis in Arizona to push through his amnesty program.
[01:16:14.818 --> 01:16:22.826]  I think he's trying to use the oil disaster and the refinery shutdowns to blackmail Congress into going along with his carbon cap and credit tax program.
[01:16:23.800 --> 01:16:26.082]  Well, there's no doubt, Mike, that you're absolutely right.
[01:16:26.082 --> 01:16:38.653]  In fact, I dovetailed that with Senator Kyle three weeks ago in a speech saying, and we played it here, that he was in a private meeting with Obama and said, we're getting thousands of dead here on the U.S.
[01:16:38.653 --> 01:16:39.114]  side.
[01:16:39.114 --> 01:16:40.955]  Mexico has collapsed.
[01:16:40.955 --> 01:16:44.338]  The illegals are past Tucson.
[01:16:44.338 --> 01:16:45.900]  It's literally Wild Wild West.
[01:16:45.900 --> 01:16:50.343]  They're putting up signs saying the public can't go down certain highways or into national parks.
[01:16:51.184 --> 01:16:53.745]  And Obama said, yes, I know the crisis is good.
[01:16:53.745 --> 01:17:01.650]  I'm not going to fix the problem down there or allow the states to fix it themselves until I've gotten my amnesty passed.
[01:17:01.650 --> 01:17:11.255]  So there you see a great window into the mindset of these people of not letting a good crisis go to waste, as Rahm Emanuel said.
[01:17:11.255 --> 01:17:17.438]  And you have BP giving the suspicious orders that their own engineers told them would make the well.
[01:17:18.498 --> 01:17:38.912]  Come in early and and cause a spill You now have them blocking the aid effort for right up to 80 days now in just a day or two You've got all that going on and you've got Obama saying cap and trade will fix this give me a carbon tax Which what does a new tax have to do with any of this?
[01:17:38.912 --> 01:17:46.978]  And you've got select top oil companies from the Associated Press article in 2000 when they sued and got the intercorporate
[01:17:48.095 --> 01:17:48.456]  Minutes?
[01:18:03.010 --> 01:18:03.270]  I think?
[01:18:24.361 --> 01:18:29.904]  Created the cap-and-trade tax in 95 with Ken Lay of Enron and Bill Clinton and Al Gore.
[01:18:29.904 --> 01:18:33.346]  We know they're the top globalist funding cap-and-trade worldwide.
[01:18:33.346 --> 01:18:36.227]  We know they've invested tens of billions in it.
[01:18:36.227 --> 01:18:38.749]  We know they're subsidiaries of Goldman Sachs.
[01:18:38.749 --> 01:18:48.774]  So absolutely, if you look at this, there's no other way to come away, but this is a crisis they're at least using to bring this in.
[01:18:48.774 --> 01:18:50.595]  But Mike, expanding on that,
[01:18:51.533 --> 01:18:55.437]  Do you think the evidence leans towards them actually blowing the oil well?
[01:18:55.437 --> 01:18:57.259]  No, I actually do not.
[01:18:57.259 --> 01:19:11.353]  I know they would like the public to think that because if there's some unknown and unknowable saboteur or terrorist that blew up the well, then British Petroleum is off the financial hook for all the damage it caused and the Obama administration is off the hook
[01:19:11.593 --> 01:19:21.399]  For the negligence of allowing the MMS to just sit there surfing internet porn on their office computers while British Petroleum was just out there engaging in all this reckless behavior.
[01:19:21.399 --> 01:19:28.583]  There is one other aspect we need to look at, and this may account for a lot of the secrecy that we're seeing around the BP disaster.
[01:19:28.583 --> 01:19:40.491]  And that is, we're hearing some reports that the Obama administration, as a quid pro quo for all those waivers, pushed British Petroleum to bring in the wells sooner to offset a potential loss during the attack on Iran.
[01:19:42.179 --> 01:19:47.385]  Well, we know they've been racing to drill new wells in the Gulf and onshore in the last year.
[01:19:47.385 --> 01:19:48.226]  Stay there.
[01:19:48.226 --> 01:19:52.671]  Come back and elaborate on that, and where you think this oil spill's going.
[01:19:52.671 --> 01:19:58.197]  Then we'll talk about Iran, and a lot more with Mike Rivero, and of course, then your phone calls.
[01:19:58.197 --> 01:19:59.438]  Key information straight ahead.
[01:19:59.438 --> 01:19:59.859]  Stay with us.

[01:22:00.774 --> 01:22:10.803]  Originally, we the people have entrusted government to be the guardians of currency, to ensure purity, content, weights and measures of gold and silver coins citizens would use for commerce.
[01:22:10.803 --> 01:22:17.249]  This reinstalled confidence after the demise of the fiat continental system, wisdom being lost with time.
[01:22:17.249 --> 01:22:26.097]  The government we once entrusted to protect from counterfeit has colluded with private business, creating the largest fiat counterfeiting scheme our country ever experienced.
[01:22:26.457 --> 01:22:35.642]  This is not only a transfer of power to an institution that is not accountable to our elected government, but has also caused the dollar to lose more than 90 cents of its original value.
[01:22:35.642 --> 01:22:40.665]  Now foreign governments are trying to divest themselves from this once world-reserved currency.
[01:22:40.665 --> 01:22:42.046]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.

[01:23:54.745 --> 01:23:56.586]  No matter how hard you try, you can't stop us now.
[01:24:27.714 --> 01:24:31.036]  Okay, let's go back to Mike Rivero.
[01:24:31.036 --> 01:24:32.697]  Mike, you got cut off by the break.
[01:24:32.697 --> 01:24:53.528]  Go back into that point, because when I've studied globalist operations, they always hit on multi-fronts, and some of these have been declassified, and so we know that they have discussions about, this'll be good to jack up oil prices, it'll be a good distraction when we hit Iran, it'll be a good way to pass the cap-and-trade tax, it'll be a good way to get more power into FEMA.
[01:24:54.248 --> 01:24:57.870]  And to shut down more industry in the United States for globalism.
[01:24:57.870 --> 01:24:59.772]  Let's go ahead and go with it.
[01:24:59.772 --> 01:25:11.059]  But we do know that two months before, BP gave orders to Anadarko and Halliburton, and that their own engineers said, this will cause the well to blow.
[01:25:11.059 --> 01:25:14.601]  And it did start leaking two months before, and there's been a cover-up of that.
[01:25:14.601 --> 01:25:22.466]  So regardless, BP gave orders, BP gave orders that they were told would cause it to blow up.
[01:25:22.466 --> 01:25:22.806]  Go ahead.
[01:25:23.820 --> 01:25:36.245]  Yeah, basically it's been known long before the actual explosion of the Deepwater Horizon that they were encountering problems because they were drilling down deeper and into areas of far greater pressure than the technologies designed to deal with.
[01:25:36.245 --> 01:25:40.127]  A lot of what BP's using in the Gulf dates back to the 1970s.
[01:25:40.127 --> 01:25:44.789]  They haven't been upgrading their equipment because with that 75, I think a $75 million cap,
[01:25:47.230 --> 01:25:56.938]  On damages, there was no financial incentive to invest in putting newer safety equipment like acoustic decouplers, acoustic shutoffs and things like that.
[01:25:56.938 --> 01:26:11.589]  But what we're hearing from certain sources is that even though they were experiencing problems, the pressure to keep going and to try and reach that oil was actually coming from the administration as the quid pro quo for all the EPA waivers and exemptions that were being handed out.
[01:26:12.069 --> 01:26:31.173]  And this story that we're getting is that the Obama administration wanted that huge reservoir of oil in the Gulf on tap and ready to deliver because when they attack Iran, and by the way, Netanyahu's on TV right now screaming about why you Americans have to go kill Iran for us, it's going to disrupt oil traffic through the Strait of Hormuz.
[01:26:31.673 --> 01:26:40.423]  And the Obama administration wanted that Gulf oil online to be able to go to all the other allies around the world and say, don't worry about the disruption to your oil flow.
[01:26:40.423 --> 01:26:42.586]  We've got it covered from the Gulf of Mexico.
[01:26:42.586 --> 01:26:47.952]  You can come get all of your oil from British Petroleum, while the Mideast oil fields are unavailable.
[01:26:47.952 --> 01:26:50.394]  And that's why, even though they were running into difficulties,
[01:26:51.258 --> 01:27:09.059]  The pressure to keep going and keep going and keep going was there, and now we've had the blow-up, and we know that ever since the Deepwater Horizon explosion, the administration continues to hand out these exemptions and waivers and permits for more of these deepwater gulf drilling operations to continue.
[01:27:09.059 --> 01:27:10.181]  I think this whole thing about
[01:27:10.541 --> 01:27:19.747]  Blocking the drilling and then overturned by the court was political theater to make Obama look like he cared about the environment to the American people ahead of the elections.
[01:27:19.747 --> 01:27:24.270]  But the reality is the drilling is continuing and they're still obviously moving to an attack on Iran.
[01:27:24.270 --> 01:27:25.171]  Well, let me go back.
[01:27:25.171 --> 01:27:34.036]  Something that backs up your view on that is that we know Obama, out of 3,000 plus wells in the Gulf, we've looked the number up, it's over 3,000,
[01:27:36.192 --> 01:27:36.432]  That's
[01:27:53.331 --> 01:27:53.631]  I don't
[01:28:12.717 --> 01:28:12.837]  to
[01:28:30.336 --> 01:28:30.636]  I don't
[01:28:54.191 --> 01:28:58.916]  A hundred and fifty million gallons or more towards landfall.
[01:28:58.916 --> 01:29:04.742]  I mean if the media is hysterical over the small amounts that have come to shore, what's going to happen when that hits?
[01:29:06.002 --> 01:29:10.746]  I think it absolutely is the worst environmental disaster in the history of the world.
[01:29:10.746 --> 01:29:12.527]  I don't think there's a thing they can do about it.
[01:29:12.527 --> 01:29:24.736]  We are continually getting reports from citizen investigators who are defying the heavy fines and Class D felony that BP has put out there for anybody daring to use a camera to show the extent of the spill.
[01:29:24.736 --> 01:29:28.919]  And we're finding out that what BP is doing is just putting new sand on the beach.
[01:29:28.919 --> 01:29:30.300]  They're not cleaning up the oil.
[01:29:30.520 --> 01:29:32.281]  They're not cleaning up the contamination.
[01:29:32.281 --> 01:29:36.105]  They're just putting new sand over it and taking a picture to say, see, it's all better.
[01:29:36.105 --> 01:29:40.148]  But every time the waves come in and wash the sand away, the oil is coming up again.
[01:29:40.148 --> 01:29:41.829]  They don't know how to deal with this thing.
[01:29:41.829 --> 01:29:42.430]  You know what?
[01:29:42.430 --> 01:29:42.910]  You know what?
[01:29:42.910 --> 01:29:43.411]  Stay there.
[01:29:43.411 --> 01:29:51.217]  Let's talk about felonies if you try to videotape in America.
[01:29:51.217 --> 01:29:52.618]  We're on the march.
[01:29:52.618 --> 01:29:55.160]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:29:55.160 --> 01:29:57.843]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:30:00.623 --> 01:30:02.265]  Hello friends, this is Alex Jones.

[01:30:53.976 --> 01:30:54.416]  Thank you!
[01:31:00.287 --> 01:31:05.251]  The question is, where should the American people draw their line in the sand?
[01:31:05.251 --> 01:31:06.252]  What have we got?
[01:31:06.252 --> 01:31:08.694]  A republic or a monarchy?
[01:31:08.694 --> 01:31:09.714]  A republic.
[01:31:09.714 --> 01:31:12.356]  It's based on a constitution which protects minority rights.
[01:31:12.356 --> 01:31:14.618]  Not democracy, not mob rule.
[01:31:14.618 --> 01:31:16.640]  Two wolves and a sheep voting on what's for dinner.
[01:31:16.640 --> 01:31:18.321]  So they think they own our land?
[01:31:18.321 --> 01:31:19.642]  They think they own our water?
[01:31:19.642 --> 01:31:20.242]  Children?
[01:31:20.242 --> 01:31:21.383]  Our education?
[01:31:21.383 --> 01:31:22.204]  Our money?
[01:31:22.204 --> 01:31:25.867]  We have to define who we are and what we will tolerate.
[01:31:26.207 --> 01:31:31.194]  Somebody's gonna ask you what you did during the Patriot Uprising.
[01:31:31.194 --> 01:31:32.215]  We have the facts.
[01:31:32.215 --> 01:31:33.376]  We have the Constitution.
[01:31:33.376 --> 01:31:34.278]  We have the Bill of Rights.
[01:31:34.278 --> 01:31:35.179]  We have common law.
[01:31:35.179 --> 01:31:37.682]  Knowledge is power, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:31:37.682 --> 01:31:41.467]  And I'm so excited to be able to offer you Don't Tread on Me, Rise of the Republic.
[01:31:41.567 --> 01:31:46.531]  Tyranny is upon us, but liberty and the sleeping giant that is the American people is rising.
[01:31:46.531 --> 01:31:48.032]  A new tool in the Info War.
[01:31:48.032 --> 01:31:49.112]  Don't tread on me.

[01:32:00.020 --> 01:32:04.582]  This is Alex Jones with 5 good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[01:32:04.582 --> 01:32:05.482]  Number 1.
[01:32:05.482 --> 01:32:08.903]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[01:32:08.903 --> 01:32:09.763]  Number 2.
[01:32:09.763 --> 01:32:14.665]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[01:32:14.665 --> 01:32:15.405]  It's true.
[01:32:15.405 --> 01:32:20.267]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[01:32:20.267 --> 01:32:21.107]  Number 3.
[01:32:21.107 --> 01:32:24.689]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[01:32:24.689 --> 01:32:28.370]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[01:32:28.590 --> 01:32:29.390]  Number 4.
[01:32:29.390 --> 01:32:32.151]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[01:32:32.151 --> 01:32:35.832]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[01:32:35.832 --> 01:32:36.612]  Number 5.
[01:32:36.612 --> 01:32:40.773]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[01:32:40.773 --> 01:32:45.815]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[01:32:45.815 --> 01:32:49.996]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.

[01:33:23.559 --> 01:33:26.481]  Okay my friends, we are back live here on the radio.
[01:33:26.481 --> 01:33:31.564]  We're also simulcasting at PrisonPlanet.tv and living video color.
[01:33:31.564 --> 01:33:33.925]  Joining us from Hawaii is Mike Rivera.
[01:33:33.925 --> 01:33:38.147]  We're going to your phone calls coming up here in about 10 minutes on a host of subjects.
[01:33:38.147 --> 01:33:46.973]  Mike's a very well versed and intelligent fellow and you can get his perspective and my perspective or give us your perspective on any of the subjects you raise.
[01:33:48.233 --> 01:34:03.485]  Now, continuing here with the point you were trying to get at as we went to break concerning BP and where you see this crisis going, calling it the America's Chernobyl.
[01:34:03.485 --> 01:34:07.007]  One of our guests this week compared it to the Dust Bowl.
[01:34:08.008 --> 01:34:17.879]  Uh, that we saw, uh, in the 1920s that, uh, populated California with Oklahomans and Texans and people from Kansas.
[01:34:17.879 --> 01:34:23.926]  I mean, definitely, uh, if the oil spill, uh, well, I mean, give us your take on it.
[01:34:24.790 --> 01:34:26.050]  Well, you're absolutely right.
[01:34:26.050 --> 01:34:29.952]  In the economic and sociological sense, this is a new dust bowl.
[01:34:29.952 --> 01:34:34.133]  The Gulf Coast states, every one of them has been contaminated with oil.
[01:34:34.133 --> 01:34:43.056]  And it's important to remember that the danger and the risk is far beyond the tar balls and the brown sludge that you can see.
[01:34:43.056 --> 01:34:50.059]  Because along with those contaminants, there are chemicals coming out of the well in large volume that are invisible.
[01:34:50.179 --> 01:34:50.319]  I think?
[01:35:11.600 --> 01:35:16.302]  But the bottom line is, the economy of the Gulf Coast states is absolutely destroyed.
[01:35:16.302 --> 01:35:24.225]  Even the $20 billion that they're talking about having for compensation claims is a drop in the bucket to deal with that kind of damage.
[01:35:24.225 --> 01:35:30.667]  We're getting reports that the claim centers for British Petroleum are very hard to find and still have unlisted phone numbers.
[01:35:30.667 --> 01:35:33.528]  They're just putting so many roadblocks in the way.
[01:35:34.008 --> 01:35:46.060]  We're finding out now that all those people who volunteered their boats to go out and try and clean up the spill and the wildlife, the bottoms of their fiberglass boats are being etched through by the correxent dispersant and the oil itself.
[01:35:46.060 --> 01:35:50.544]  There's no plans to compensate these boat owners for the loss of their boats and their livelihood along...
[01:35:51.545 --> 01:35:51.806]  I think?
[01:36:08.647 --> 01:36:15.295]  British Petroleum is owned by the Queen of England and I find it rather interesting she's in New York today for just five hours.
[01:36:15.295 --> 01:36:23.224]  That's a heck of a flight two ways to spend just five hours in New York and I know there's an overt reason for her to be there to address the United Nations.
[01:36:23.584 --> 01:36:31.868]  But I kind of wonder if maybe she isn't talking to some of the local British Petroleum people about how they're going to deal with this mess, because I don't see any way that they've got to stop it.
[01:36:31.868 --> 01:36:33.349]  The well casing is destroyed.
[01:36:33.349 --> 01:36:34.850]  The drill pipe is destroyed.
[01:36:34.850 --> 01:36:41.253]  We know there's a subsurface blowout about a thousand feet down that's beginning to seep up through fissures in the ocean floor.
[01:36:41.253 --> 01:36:45.135]  It's just, it's, it's just, it's out of control.
[01:36:45.135 --> 01:36:46.936]  I don't think they've got the resources to stop it.
[01:36:48.390 --> 01:36:53.493]  But their government, I mean they've got to be able to wave a magic wand and save us all.
[01:36:53.493 --> 01:36:56.955]  And we saw the government not let people leave New Orleans.
[01:36:56.955 --> 01:37:01.178]  We saw the government not bring them food and water, but come for their guns.
[01:37:01.178 --> 01:37:06.081]  Can you imagine what they're going to try if those hundreds of millions of gallons of oil
[01:37:06.801 --> 01:37:13.646]  Starts coming into shore, and we've only seen a tiny fraction of the oil actually hit shore, and that's been devastating.
[01:37:13.646 --> 01:37:19.329]  I mean, this is going to be like Armageddon if those hundreds of millions of gallons hit.
[01:37:19.329 --> 01:37:21.431]  And I'm already seeing video footage.
[01:37:21.431 --> 01:37:25.814]  Kurt Nimmo wrote a story about it at Infowars.com, troops patrolling Florida.
[01:37:26.434 --> 01:37:32.801]  There's troops and BP people already stomping around bossing Floridians laying out in the sun around.
[01:37:32.801 --> 01:37:38.427]  I mean, what is having a bunch of troops with guns bossing people around going to do?
[01:37:38.427 --> 01:37:40.569]  I mean, this is going to be hellish.
[01:37:40.569 --> 01:37:42.451]  And then the feds are such control freaks.
[01:37:43.052 --> 01:37:48.573]  We'll only give the cleanup contracts to BP subsidiaries so they make money off of it.
[01:37:48.573 --> 01:37:51.214]  They're hell-bent on making money out of this crisis.
[01:37:51.214 --> 01:37:57.475]  And so I guess just the Gulf won't be inhabitable for four or five years until the oil rots away.
[01:37:57.475 --> 01:38:06.336]  And by then it'll be a ghost town and it just won't matter because the elite doesn't care and they'll just put a new puppet in because they don't care if we throw out their puppets.
[01:38:06.336 --> 01:38:09.617]  It's the corporate government that we can't ever get rid of.
[01:38:10.936 --> 01:38:13.117]  Well, it's going to be longer than four or five years.
[01:38:13.117 --> 01:38:19.159]  I mean, if you go up to Prince William Sound, where the Exxon Valdez ran aground, there's still oil up there.
[01:38:19.159 --> 01:38:25.581]  They cleaned off what you can see on the surface, but if you dig a hole in the edge of the waterline or you pick up some rocks, it's still there.
[01:38:26.081 --> 01:38:36.849]  And all those cleanup workers who clean up after the Exxon Valdez, they're all dead and they died of these illnesses that you get from exposure to these very toxic chemicals.
[01:38:36.849 --> 01:38:45.456]  And now we've got BP down there in the Gulf telling their cleanup workers they are not allowed to wear respirators or gloves because it looks bad in the press cameras.
[01:38:45.456 --> 01:38:53.942]  We've got CNN reporting they're being told they can get no closer than 65 feet to any of the oiled wildlife or the booms or the beaches.
[01:38:53.942 --> 01:38:54.943]  They're trying to basically...
[01:38:55.103 --> 01:38:59.885]  They're more concerned about how this looks than by the actual damage being done to the environment.
[01:38:59.885 --> 01:39:09.490]  And as I said before, we're getting reports from some of our readers that British Petroleum just shows up with a truck of sand, spreads it along the beach to cover the oil, declare it clean, and then they leave.
[01:39:09.490 --> 01:39:12.611]  And of course, the next time the tide comes in... Well no, I mean, Mike, Mike, that's confirmed.
[01:39:12.611 --> 01:39:21.215]  That's why they've run off CBS, CNN, ABC, Fox, local newspapers, people that live there, because that's what they do.
[01:39:21.215 --> 01:39:23.356]  They are coming in and dumping sand on it.
[01:39:24.116 --> 01:39:24.757]  On record.
[01:39:24.757 --> 01:39:26.298]  I mean, that's on record.
[01:39:26.298 --> 01:39:39.270]  And then I've got the press reports here where BP is on record with the feds and they have the head of the Coast Guard threatening federal felonies on anyone that videotapes him and they claim it's only
[01:39:40.635 --> 01:39:42.176]  So many hundred feet.
[01:39:42.176 --> 01:39:47.137]  But time and time again, it's reporters who are a quarter mile away.
[01:39:47.137 --> 01:39:50.518]  Then BP orders cops to chase them down and arrest them.
[01:39:50.518 --> 01:39:53.820]  I mean, I've got all the press reports and videos right here.
[01:39:53.820 --> 01:39:56.040]  I mean, it's just in America.
[01:39:56.040 --> 01:40:02.663]  I've got Anderson Cooper on video announcing, quote, the First Amendment is dead in America, which is actually true.
[01:40:02.663 --> 01:40:06.304]  But why are they just it seems like they're trying to break our will.
[01:40:07.628 --> 01:40:20.015]  Well, I think what it is is they're afraid that if the American people were forced to confront the totality of the disaster and how badly it has affected all of us, not just the people in the Gulf Coast states, but it's destroying the entire economy.
[01:40:20.015 --> 01:40:24.437]  It's just, you know, the Gulf Coast fishing zones are pretty much shut down.
[01:40:24.437 --> 01:40:26.318]  Now it's coming up the Atlantic seaboard.
[01:40:26.318 --> 01:40:31.481]  We're going to be looking at famine and starvation here in the United States because we are very dependent
[01:40:31.841 --> 01:40:50.968]  on those coastal fishing waters and they're being shut down because of all this contamination and it's all going to come back the american people are so angry with the government right now this could be the final straw justice chair noble was that last big step before the collapse of the soviet union and uh... so they're all terrible that's a good point showed that
[01:40:52.031 --> 01:41:01.676]  Despite all their fancy uniforms and the big red square parades, that the government was basically weak and pathetic, but only good at putting on a show.
[01:41:01.676 --> 01:41:07.140]  And then now Bloomberg reports 46 states bankrupt or on the verge of bankruptcy.
[01:41:07.140 --> 01:41:12.403]  USA Today today expect lots of government layoffs at state, local level.
[01:41:12.403 --> 01:41:18.506]  I literally see more than 10 articles a day without even looking, Mike, and I know you see them because you're a newshound.
[01:41:20.587 --> 01:41:25.109]  Where they are laying off more than half the cops, more than half the firemen.
[01:41:25.109 --> 01:41:29.792]  Where whole counties are announcing, we're never gonna fix another pothole.
[01:41:29.792 --> 01:41:34.694]  But then meanwhile, in one county they said, well, we'll have 44 cops left.
[01:41:34.694 --> 01:41:36.715]  We're getting rid of more than half.
[01:41:36.715 --> 01:41:41.398]  And the 44 that are left are only allowed to write tickets and raise money and run the jail.
[01:41:41.398 --> 01:41:46.961]  And there'll be one deputy per shift who's actually on patrol to help you, or three a day.
[01:41:47.681 --> 01:42:04.790]  I mean, this is treason, and how do they have these counties and cities under mine control where they've raised taxes and openly say all the money must go to interest to bankers because the central banks came in and sold derivatives to the cities?
[01:42:04.790 --> 01:42:08.012]  I mean, this is literally a road warrior scenario.
[01:42:08.012 --> 01:42:09.593]  I saw footage last week in Detroit.
[01:42:10.473 --> 01:42:20.559]  of armed men with assault rifles guarding the unloading of trucks in Michigan at a grocery store.
[01:42:20.559 --> 01:42:24.761]  I mean, it is literally already road warrior in many areas.
[01:42:24.761 --> 01:42:27.202]  I mean, the Southwest is collapsing.
[01:42:27.202 --> 01:42:29.924]  The illegal aliens and the drug dealers know it's collapsed.
[01:42:29.924 --> 01:42:31.524]  They're just taking over.
[01:42:31.524 --> 01:42:33.906]  I mean, this country is in a hell of a
[01:42:35.166 --> 01:42:43.169]  I mean, we're going to hell in a handbasket here.
[01:42:43.169 --> 01:42:43.989]  We certainly are.
[01:42:43.989 --> 01:42:55.933]  I mean, a story this last week that shocked me, here on the island of Oahu, just down at the bottom of this hill that I'm living on, there is a 50, that's 5-0, acre campsite of homeless people in tents.
[01:42:55.933 --> 01:42:56.853]  Thousands of people.
[01:42:57.313 --> 01:43:00.234]  Living right along the North Shore of Pearl Harbor.
[01:43:00.234 --> 01:43:01.674]  I knew we had a homeless problem.
[01:43:01.674 --> 01:43:03.595]  I had no idea it was that bad.
[01:43:03.595 --> 01:43:09.277]  It came to national attention when Dog the Bounty Hunter went through there and put it all up on national TV.
[01:43:09.277 --> 01:43:14.878]  And everybody is shocked to see the scale of the homeless problem here on the island of Oahu in Hawaii.
[01:43:14.878 --> 01:43:16.619]  And it's that way everywhere.
[01:43:16.619 --> 01:43:17.979]  It's just an ugly situation.
[01:43:17.979 --> 01:43:19.140]  The country's shutting down.
[01:43:19.140 --> 01:43:23.341]  And the part that annoys me is Barack Obama could stop this overnight.
[01:43:23.681 --> 01:43:36.191]  Because he's got the authority to issue government-issued currency the way Abraham Lincoln did, the way John F. Kennedy did, the way this country was started, and, you know, remove our dependency and enslavement to the private bankers.
[01:43:36.191 --> 01:43:37.572]  Well, I'm not for socialism.
[01:43:37.572 --> 01:43:38.473]  Great point, Mike.
[01:43:38.473 --> 01:43:39.774]  I'm not for socialism.
[01:43:39.774 --> 01:43:44.237]  But if we're going to give $28 trillion, and that number's seven months old.
[01:43:44.237 --> 01:43:47.480]  That number is from January of this year, Bloomberg.
[01:43:48.240 --> 01:44:01.948]  If we're going to give $28 trillion to bankers who don't even deserve it and who are criminal, I mean, if they just gave everybody $30,000, and that's basically everybody's debt is what, $36,000 out of this bailout.
[01:44:01.948 --> 01:44:06.871]  If they just gave us all $36,000, that would actually supercharge the economy.
[01:44:06.871 --> 01:44:14.476]  Instead, they're raising taxes, which is like coming up to a man who's having a heart attack and slitting his wrist.
[01:44:14.476 --> 01:44:15.757]  I mean, it's going to kill us.
[01:44:16.789 --> 01:44:17.829]  Yeah, it absolutely is.
[01:44:17.829 --> 01:44:30.413]  I mean, the bottom line is, if they had given that money, that bailout and tarp money to the American people, we wouldn't have a foreclosure crisis because people would be making their mortgage payments, people would be investing in small businesses, they'd be buying American cars.
[01:44:30.413 --> 01:44:35.734]  Everything that has gone wrong with this country is because the money is moving in the wrong direction.
[01:44:35.734 --> 01:44:39.495]  Now, I'm not a socialist either, but what we have right now is fascism.
[01:44:39.795 --> 01:44:44.439]  Which is where profits are kept private and the losses are socialized across all the people.
[01:44:44.439 --> 01:44:45.960]  And that's what's going on in this country.
[01:44:45.960 --> 01:44:47.862]  That's what all the tarp and the bailout.
[01:44:47.862 --> 01:44:48.983]  It's not communism.
[01:44:48.983 --> 01:44:50.184]  It's not socialism.
[01:44:50.184 --> 01:44:51.405]  It is fascism.
[01:44:51.405 --> 01:44:52.846]  And that's, it's destroying the country.
[01:44:54.005 --> 01:44:57.226]  Well, people better make a decision right now than we're going to phone calls.
[01:44:57.226 --> 01:44:58.246]  You better make a decision.
[01:44:58.246 --> 01:44:59.467]  This is real.
[01:44:59.467 --> 01:45:03.308]  What is starting to unfold now is going to dwarf the Great Depression.
[01:45:03.308 --> 01:45:05.569]  It is going to dwarf World War III.
[01:45:05.569 --> 01:45:06.969]  It is going to dwarf it all.
[01:45:06.969 --> 01:45:13.892]  The New World Order is moving on every front right now to bring in a cascading
[01:45:15.390 --> 01:45:15.970]  I think?
[01:45:39.264 --> 01:45:40.024]  This is real.
[01:45:40.024 --> 01:45:41.265]  This isn't a drill.
[01:45:41.265 --> 01:45:41.965]  It isn't a game.
[01:45:41.965 --> 01:45:52.588]  So all you yuppies and all you cops and all the bureaucrats and all the FBI agents and all of you people out there that have been smug in the system and that think you're safe, you are not safe.
[01:45:52.588 --> 01:45:56.490]  You are killing the goose that lays the golden eggs.
[01:45:56.490 --> 01:45:59.591]  This system that's coming into fruition is hellish.
[01:45:59.591 --> 01:46:01.732]  Mike, let me ask this question and then we're going to calls.
[01:46:01.732 --> 01:46:02.532]  Why do you think
[01:46:03.615 --> 01:46:11.507]  They've gone after two years of denying we're in a depression, when by every classic indicator of a depression, we were in one.
[01:46:11.507 --> 01:46:12.789]  Three quarters of no growth.
[01:46:13.755 --> 01:46:15.776]  Massive unemployment.
[01:46:15.776 --> 01:46:22.861]  You've got inflation in products, but deflation in Main Street and in what people are being paid.
[01:46:22.861 --> 01:46:26.524]  And that's, again, unnatural, even in Keynesian economics, for those that don't know.
[01:46:26.524 --> 01:46:28.545]  Only a rigged system can do that.
[01:46:28.545 --> 01:46:31.347]  Dow repeats Great Depression pattern.
[01:46:31.347 --> 01:46:32.508]  Chart shows.
[01:46:32.508 --> 01:46:33.648]  We reported this a year ago.
[01:46:33.648 --> 01:46:35.470]  Here it is, CNBC.
[01:46:35.470 --> 01:46:36.490]  Here's another one.
[01:46:36.490 --> 01:46:42.674]  I've got a whole stack of headlines here, where all these mainstream newspapers are reporting.
[01:46:42.674 --> 01:46:43.115]  Here they are.
[01:46:44.095 --> 01:46:45.376]  Happy 4th of July.
[01:46:45.376 --> 01:46:46.836]  America needs it.
[01:46:46.836 --> 01:46:51.018]  The Great Republic is in a perilous state, politically and economically.
[01:46:51.018 --> 01:46:52.839]  Here's London Telegraph.
[01:46:52.839 --> 01:46:57.760]  With the US trapped in depression, this really is starting to feel like 1932.
[01:46:57.760 --> 01:46:58.881]  Ambrose Evans Pritchard.
[01:46:59.361 --> 01:47:01.982]  You know, the New York Times, the Third Depression.
[01:47:01.982 --> 01:47:04.282]  This is just the articles that we're laying around here.
[01:47:04.282 --> 01:47:08.123]  They've suddenly shifted and are admitting we're going into a depression.
[01:47:08.123 --> 01:47:11.103]  So, first they're denying we're even in a second recession.
[01:47:11.103 --> 01:47:16.704]  We never left the first recession that started between six to four years ago, depending on how you look at it, with the real numbers.
[01:47:16.704 --> 01:47:18.985]  We've been in a depression for at least two years.
[01:47:18.985 --> 01:47:23.606]  Now they skip denying we're in a recession, going right into depression.
[01:47:23.606 --> 01:47:24.466]  Why are they doing that?
[01:47:25.202 --> 01:47:28.626]  Well, they've been trying to avoid the word depression because of the negative connotation.
[01:47:28.626 --> 01:47:35.293]  And you need to understand that the word depression was used back during 1929 to avoid using the word crash.
[01:47:35.293 --> 01:47:37.014]  So they're always looking for a new word.
[01:47:37.014 --> 01:47:40.798]  We don't want to call it what it was before because people have got negative connotations.
[01:47:40.798 --> 01:47:42.460]  It's all about perception management.
[01:47:42.700 --> 01:47:44.822]  Can't call it a crash, so we'll call it a depression.
[01:47:44.822 --> 01:47:47.163]  Don't want to call it a depression, so we'll call it a recession.
[01:47:47.163 --> 01:47:49.585]  Don't want to call it a recession, so we'll call it a shrunk.
[01:47:49.585 --> 01:47:51.787]  Can't call it a shrunk anymore, we'll call it a fizzbin.
[01:47:51.787 --> 01:47:54.249]  This is all about propagandizing the people.
[01:47:54.249 --> 01:47:59.252]  I mean, earlier today, there was this story out there saying, you know, time to buy back into the stock market.
[01:47:59.252 --> 01:48:06.838]  They're heading to record highs, and it's an absolutely ridiculous statement, but they're just trying to rah-rah the people into thinking things are going to be okay.
[01:48:06.838 --> 01:48:08.239]  Give us a little more time.
[01:48:08.239 --> 01:48:09.880]  Don't tar and feather the politicians.
[01:48:09.880 --> 01:48:10.821]  It's all going to work out.
[01:48:11.081 --> 01:48:20.608]  And I think the American people have woken up to the fact that that is definitely not going to be the case because the Dow is definitely headed back down again despite the early morning shove and rah-rah.
[01:48:20.608 --> 01:48:26.893]  And the bottom line is the government has created this huge credibility crisis where nobody is going to believe them any longer.
[01:48:26.893 --> 01:48:35.379]  They're just looking for a new word, a new sales pitch, a new branding that they can put on the government to convince the people to go along with it a little bit longer.
[01:48:35.379 --> 01:48:37.461]  And I think we're approaching the breaking point.
[01:48:37.461 --> 01:48:38.802]  I know I'm at my breaking point.
[01:48:39.142 --> 01:48:46.707]  And I'm glad you raised that point, because I get emails saying, how dare you say we're in a depression?
[01:48:46.707 --> 01:48:48.749]  You're destroying confidence.
[01:48:48.749 --> 01:48:49.589]  You're a traitor.
[01:48:49.589 --> 01:48:52.211]  I've been seeing that for at least four years.
[01:48:52.211 --> 01:48:57.034]  And people comment in the online versions, the Obama deception, fall of the republic.
[01:48:57.034 --> 01:48:59.176]  And I've seen it even on some financial sites.
[01:48:59.176 --> 01:49:01.017]  Guys, don't listen to this guy.
[01:49:01.017 --> 01:49:04.860]  If you do, you're going to lose your 401K, as if it's my fault.
[01:49:05.640 --> 01:49:12.842]  When the Washington Post admits it's 600 trillion conservatively in made-up derivatives.
[01:49:12.842 --> 01:49:18.423]  I mean, how many times is that above our 14 trillion dollar entire GDP every year?
[01:49:18.423 --> 01:49:23.744]  This is a black hole where more debt is created than actual currency.
[01:49:23.744 --> 01:49:28.865]  It's designed by these private banking families to take over our society.
[01:49:28.865 --> 01:49:31.565]  We have their own IMF, World Bank, White Papers admitting it.
[01:49:31.565 --> 01:49:33.766]  And all I'm doing is stating that
[01:49:34.757 --> 01:49:36.101]  A derivatives would destroy us.
[01:49:36.101 --> 01:49:38.731]  I said this 10 years ago when Economist I Trust laid it out.
[01:49:38.731 --> 01:49:39.734]  It was common sense.
[01:49:41.661 --> 01:49:47.446]  B, all I'm doing is laying out the facts and they're saying that I'm the traitor, Mike.
[01:49:47.446 --> 01:49:48.386]  You're the traitor.
[01:49:48.386 --> 01:49:53.490]  We're supposed to just say, yes, Wall Street is God, raise the taxes, carbon taxes.
[01:49:53.490 --> 01:49:59.595]  No, taxes in big government and derivative counterfeit crap is the problem.
[01:49:59.595 --> 01:50:02.157]  Not us saying, stop these bankers.
[01:50:02.157 --> 01:50:04.239]  We're not the reason this is happening.
[01:50:04.239 --> 01:50:07.942]  If people would have listened to us and Ron Paul, this wouldn't be going on right now.
[01:50:08.820 --> 01:50:10.481]  Well, you're absolutely true about that.
[01:50:10.481 --> 01:50:18.187]  I mean, the major impetus for the war of independence in this country was to free ourselves from the manipulations of the Bank of England.
[01:50:18.187 --> 01:50:33.079]  And I know our schools talk about the Tea Act and the Stamp Act, but it was the Currency Act where King George III forbade the states from printing their own currency and demanded that they borrow currency from the Bank of England at interest, the same situation we have with the Federal Reserve.
[01:50:33.079 --> 01:50:36.601]  That's what produced the anger that supported the American Revolution.
[01:50:36.601 --> 01:50:38.403]  And we're back in the same mess we were in
[01:50:39.223 --> 01:50:53.397]  That's right, I've read scores of books on the revolution and it was all about money manipulation, all about mercantilism, the globalism of their age, all about fat cats with unfair trade advantages.
[01:50:53.397 --> 01:50:55.959]  It was not about tea and tea taxes.
[01:50:55.959 --> 01:50:59.122]  There was one protest that dealt with that, the Boston Tea Party.
[01:50:59.122 --> 01:51:00.223]  We'll be right back, stay with us.
[01:51:01.243 --> 01:51:02.204]  Here's a question.

[01:51:57.617 --> 01:52:02.379]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[01:52:02.379 --> 01:52:07.962]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[01:52:07.962 --> 01:52:12.984]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds can become more valuable than silver or gold?
[01:52:12.984 --> 01:52:13.464]  It's true.
[01:52:13.464 --> 01:52:16.265]  Seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country.
[01:52:16.265 --> 01:52:18.006]  And it's possible that could even happen again.

[01:53:01.598 --> 01:53:05.362]  So you think the massive Gulf oil leak won't affect the air you breathe?
[01:53:05.362 --> 01:53:05.863]  Think again!
[01:53:06.644 --> 01:53:14.310]  Benzene, a toxic gas emitted from crude oil and a known carcinogen, is now airborne traveling hundreds, even thousands of miles inland.
[01:53:14.310 --> 01:53:21.536]  Whether you live near the Gulf or not, benzene and other volatile organic compounds could cause adverse reactions to those living inside your home.
[01:53:21.536 --> 01:53:29.783]  NOAA, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, came to airfiltersandpurifiers.com for answers on how to clean the air on boats aiding in the Gulf cleanup.

[01:54:07.186 --> 01:54:09.768]  Every morning at the mine you could see him arrive.
[01:54:09.768 --> 01:54:12.189]  He stood six foot six and weighed 245.
[01:54:12.189 --> 01:54:15.490]  Kind of broad at the shoulder and narrow at the hip.
[01:54:15.490 --> 01:54:18.772]  And everybody knew you didn't give no lip to Big John.
[01:54:24.580 --> 01:54:27.263]  Ladies and gentlemen, the public is now ready to be awakened.
[01:54:27.263 --> 01:54:28.625]  They're now ready for real solutions.
[01:54:28.625 --> 01:54:34.792]  And one of the big ones is Bill Still's new film, The Secret of Oz, exposing the banking cartel.
[01:54:34.792 --> 01:54:38.076]  And it has really good monetary solutions to counter it.
[01:54:38.797 --> 01:54:39.958]  And we sold out of these.
[01:54:39.958 --> 01:54:40.879]  We had them on Friday.
[01:54:40.879 --> 01:54:41.780]  We sold out.
[01:54:41.780 --> 01:54:44.923]  And luckily, we just got more in today.
[01:54:44.923 --> 01:54:46.785]  So that's how popular this film is.
[01:54:46.785 --> 01:54:49.668]  Available at Infowars.com.
[01:54:49.668 --> 01:54:53.152]  The Secret of Oz, Solutions for a Broken Economy.
[01:54:53.152 --> 01:54:54.574]  Available at Infowars.com.
[01:54:56.115 --> 01:54:58.476]  You can call toll-free 888-253-3139.
[01:54:58.476 --> 01:55:06.658]  I'm going to keep Mike Rivera with us a little bit into the next hour, if he can do it.
[01:55:06.658 --> 01:55:11.220]  Brad, Pastor Al, Mike, Tim, we're going to get to all of you now.
[01:55:11.220 --> 01:55:15.241]  And then coming up, illegal immigration costs U.S.
[01:55:15.241 --> 01:55:21.243]  $113 billion a year, study finds, and here's another one, feds to file lawsuit over Arizona immigration law.
[01:55:21.843 --> 01:55:39.469]  The state is literally on the verge of collapsing in many areas, totally lawless, and the government is involved in treason, trying to block the state from saying, if we pull somebody over, drunk driving, and they don't have a driver's license and they're an illegal alien, we'll take them to jail.
[01:55:39.469 --> 01:55:42.750]  Again, they're not a schmuck citizen meant to be fed on.
[01:55:42.750 --> 01:55:45.391]  They are an illegal alien meant to drive down the wages.
[01:55:45.391 --> 01:55:46.771]  It's part of globalism.
[01:55:46.771 --> 01:55:49.412]  Brad in California, you're on the air with Mike Rivero, go ahead.
[01:55:50.462 --> 01:55:52.205]  Alright, hello gentlemen.
[01:55:52.205 --> 01:55:53.266]  I have two questions.
[01:55:53.266 --> 01:55:56.731]  I'll address my more important one first.
[01:55:56.731 --> 01:55:59.135]  I have been researching just recently this
[01:56:01.971 --> 01:56:06.914]  That was a citizen's court, which I think are good to kind of illustrate issues, but it wasn't an official court.
[01:56:32.465 --> 01:56:43.136]  Yeah, my second thing was I was wondering if you guys know about genetically modified plants with vaccines and drugs in them coming out?
[01:56:43.476 --> 01:56:51.038]  Yeah, they're called pharmacological crops, and a lot of the GMO crops you already eat really are pharmacological crops.
[01:56:51.038 --> 01:56:52.379]  They just didn't tell you.
[01:56:52.379 --> 01:56:55.360]  And we've got all the government documents on that in the upcoming film.
[01:56:55.360 --> 01:56:56.340]  It's incredible.
[01:56:56.340 --> 01:56:57.280]  Thanks for the call, Brad.
[01:56:57.280 --> 01:56:58.661]  Interesting points.
[01:56:58.661 --> 01:57:05.183]  Mike Rivera, your comment on Manning's trial that he had of Obama, Barry Sitaro, and then on the GMO.
[01:57:06.570 --> 01:57:25.162]  Well, uh, this issue of Obama's eligibility to be president, I think it's a distraction to get people to argue back and forth about his birth certificate instead of looking at the real issues about, uh, well, for me, the number one issue is Americans got attacked in international waters and Obama did nothing about it, and now he's making buddy-buddy with Netanyahu.
[01:57:25.162 --> 01:57:28.685]  I think that's far more important than the story of his birth certificate.
[01:57:28.685 --> 01:57:36.090]  What do you make of Turkey saying, and Turkey's a big ally of Israel, uh, even sells them weapons, uh, in fact, vice versa,
[01:57:36.690 --> 01:57:49.958]  Turkey's saying if you don't apologize for that we are gonna break off ties with you and Israel says we're not gonna apologize I mean they could at least say okay We could have done that a little bit better, and we'll you know I mean that's called detente, but but no
[01:57:51.243 --> 01:58:06.266]  Well, first of all, congratulations to Turkey, and if Obama was a real president of the American people, he should have started off this meeting with Netanyahu by saying, item number one is an apology to America for attacking our people.
[01:58:06.266 --> 01:58:13.268]  And short of such an apology, the meeting is over, thank you very much, and there are no more checks being signed for Israel this month.
[01:58:13.268 --> 01:58:14.948]  And that's what should have been done.
[01:58:14.948 --> 01:58:18.129]  But then it would come out that Obama is a cocaine addict, and
[01:58:19.682 --> 01:58:24.363]  Is involved in other things with mafia bosses in Chicago.
[01:58:24.363 --> 01:58:29.224]  Alright Mike, stay there Mike.
[01:58:29.224 --> 01:58:31.925]  I'm going to hold you over if you can do it and continue with phone calls.
[01:58:31.925 --> 01:58:36.366]  Pastor, Al, Mike, Tim and others, your calls are straight ahead with Mike.
[01:58:36.366 --> 01:58:38.586]  And of course I'm Alex Jones, InfoWars.com.

[02:00:01.724 --> 02:00:02.485]  Big Brother!
[02:00:07.145 --> 02:00:08.926]  Mainstream media.
[02:00:08.926 --> 02:00:10.667]  Government cover-ups.
[02:00:10.667 --> 02:00:12.268]  You want answers?
[02:00:12.268 --> 02:00:13.810]  Well, so does he.

[02:00:18.012 --> 02:00:22.075]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:26.363 --> 02:00:29.005]  We've reached the waypoint in broadcast.
[02:00:29.005 --> 02:00:30.886]  Mike will be leaving us here in about 15 minutes.
[02:00:30.886 --> 02:00:39.151]  I will continue with calls and a big news blitz coming up on the economy, the oil spill, the situation with Iran.
[02:00:40.419 --> 02:00:47.561]  We're going to take a few more calls, and I'm going to get Mike's take, because he really does do a lot of research on this, on whether or not they're going to be hitting Iran.
[02:00:47.561 --> 02:00:49.442]  They've got an Israeli, a U.S.
[02:00:49.442 --> 02:00:54.704]  flotilla, there's a Dutch flotilla of all countries making its way to the Gulf.
[02:00:54.704 --> 02:01:05.467]  Open saber-rattling, open talk of a preemptive strike on Iran, and on intensifying economic blockades of the country that are acts of war.
[02:01:05.467 --> 02:01:09.589]  We'll talk about that, but Pastor in Ohio, Pastor, you're on the air, go ahead.
[02:01:10.327 --> 02:01:10.947]  Okay.
[02:01:10.947 --> 02:01:22.252]  Alex, I, uh, first of all want to say thank you for taking on the people that you've been taking on as far as, uh, that have their products listed on your internet site.
[02:01:22.252 --> 02:01:25.833]  We've been using that, uh, Silver Lungs thing now.
[02:01:25.833 --> 02:01:28.834]  And not only just us, but people in our church.
[02:01:28.834 --> 02:01:34.816]  And I can tell you that nobody has had as much as even a common cold since last October.
[02:01:34.816 --> 02:01:36.097]  I mean, things are just awesome.
[02:01:36.641 --> 02:01:47.284]  The other thing is, is I talked to you when you was interviewing Lindsey Williams, and I was sharing with the thing, because I, before I got called into the ministry, I was a petroleum engineer.
[02:01:47.284 --> 02:01:49.204]  I worked for Halliburton, and I worked for B.J.
[02:01:49.204 --> 02:01:54.226]  Hughes both, and they both do offshore cementing and everything else.
[02:01:54.226 --> 02:02:02.428]  And I knew, and I was even saying then, that this was, that oil rig disaster down there was not an accident.
[02:02:02.428 --> 02:02:03.768]  And back in February,
[02:02:04.668 --> 02:02:14.873]  Uh, before that even happened, they, Halliburton, when they cemented that pipe in, they even said then that the cement job wasn't any good for plain simple reason.
[02:02:14.873 --> 02:02:21.917]  They hit, uh, gas pockets and oil pockets, which compromised the pipe being cemented in correctly.
[02:02:21.917 --> 02:02:26.059]  Well, they could have went in and redone that, but they didn't.
[02:02:26.059 --> 02:02:29.540]  And they went ahead and drilled through the plug and went on down.
[02:02:29.540 --> 02:02:30.601]  In a hurry.
[02:02:30.601 --> 02:02:32.422]  Now, the other thing is, is this.
[02:02:33.283 --> 02:02:39.045]  I, you know, I even said back then the main thing is that we're going to have to worry about is the gas is coming out of that.
[02:02:39.045 --> 02:02:45.767]  And also said that it was like a reservoir sitting on top of a volcano and I still stick to that.
[02:02:45.767 --> 02:02:51.709]  And the other, uh, one thing I want to point out is they're keeping everybody out of that gulf.
[02:02:51.709 --> 02:02:55.110]  No pictures, no flyovers, no nothing.
[02:02:55.110 --> 02:03:02.613]  And just from when you just look at the situation as far as the, what's going, you know, if you know anything about oil and gas,
[02:03:03.177 --> 02:03:04.958]  Drilling and such.
[02:03:04.958 --> 02:03:17.404]  One of the things that can actually happen, when they went in there and pumped that mud down there to try to shut that well off, it went out through, they busted the pipe and it went out through there and cracked the seafloor.
[02:03:17.404 --> 02:03:26.208]  Well, I still say, and I'll stand by this, the next thing that's probably going to happen is that pipe's going to come out of the ground.
[02:03:27.133 --> 02:03:31.954]  And when that pipe starts coming out of the ground, there's no way of controlling that whatsoever.
[02:03:31.954 --> 02:03:32.975]  No, I hear you, Pastor.
[02:03:32.975 --> 02:03:34.655]  I appreciate your info.
[02:03:34.655 --> 02:03:43.278]  Mike, I mean, it appears it's already, for a month and a half, it's already broken through the pipe and it's ruptured and they've got stuff 20 miles away coming up out of the ground.
[02:03:44.127 --> 02:03:46.228]  Yeah, there's no question.
[02:03:46.228 --> 02:03:48.349]  They used a very cheap well casing.
[02:03:48.349 --> 02:03:54.632]  It's been pounded on by gravel and grit and rocks coming up out of that well for the last 70 plus days.
[02:03:54.632 --> 02:04:01.795]  We knew that even before the Deepwater Horizon explosion, the drill was bringing up pieces of hard rubber from the safety equipment.
[02:04:01.795 --> 02:04:04.516]  They'd accidentally drilled their own safety gear.
[02:04:04.516 --> 02:04:10.359]  That's why they knew that there was that valve about 1,000 feet down under the floor of the Gulf of Mexico that was damaged.
[02:04:10.359 --> 02:04:12.440]  And that's why the top kill operation failed.
[02:04:12.740 --> 02:04:15.483]  And what happens when the Gulf heats up this summer?
[02:04:15.483 --> 02:04:17.304]  Is it starting to do and all that methane gets released?
[02:04:37.439 --> 02:04:46.786]  The methane is the biggest problem because if there are more of these methane kicks, there are no safety systems whatsoever to deal with new methane explosions coming up out of that pipe.
[02:04:46.786 --> 02:04:55.273]  Alright, let's come back and talk about that and then more calls and we'll also talk more about Iran with Mike Rivera, WhatReallyHappened.com is his website.

[02:07:57.203 --> 02:07:58.944]  This information is too important to wait.
[02:08:01.058 --> 02:08:06.464]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents The Alex Jones Show.
[02:08:06.464 --> 02:08:10.368]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[02:08:10.368 --> 02:08:11.229]  Okay, my friends.
[02:08:11.229 --> 02:08:14.592]  For the rest of this segment, we're talking with Mike Rivero and taking your calls.
[02:08:14.592 --> 02:08:15.793]  I will then continue with calls.
[02:08:16.534 --> 02:08:19.996]  Throughout the balance of the broadcast today, interspersed with news and information.
[02:08:19.996 --> 02:08:26.320]  First, I wanted to tell you about how to start getting off the grid, and that's mysolarbackup.com.
[02:08:26.320 --> 02:08:30.363]  Have you lost your power and wanted to simply flip a switch to get the lights back on?
[02:08:30.363 --> 02:08:39.389]  If so, you should check out mysolarbackup.com, because there's never been a better time to start getting off the grid and generate your own supply of electrical power.
[02:08:40.089 --> 02:08:47.514]  These wonderful plug-and-play solar generators are available from our longtime sponsors of Solutions from Science.
[02:08:47.514 --> 02:08:51.076]  Unlike gas generators, the solar generator runs quietly and emits no fumes.
[02:08:51.076 --> 02:08:55.279]  It's like having your own electric power plant and it's perfect for your home or your campsite.
[02:08:55.839 --> 02:09:09.049]  Whether it's hurricanes, ice storms, brownouts, or blackouts, or you just don't want to pay the blood-sucking power companies money, you need to check out mysolarbackup.com or give them a call for a free information package at 877-327-0365, 877-327-0365, mysolarbackup.com.
[02:09:16.155 --> 02:09:19.536]  And lastly, I want to tell you about FrontSight.com.
[02:09:19.536 --> 02:09:21.377]  Have you heard of the Millionaire Patriot?
[02:09:21.377 --> 02:09:25.058]  He has a free handgun and five days of firearms training waiting for you.
[02:09:25.058 --> 02:09:33.540]  You can attend five days of world-class gun training at FrontSight Firearms Training Institute and secure a 30-stake concealed weapons permit, all for pennies on the dollar.
[02:09:33.540 --> 02:09:38.842]  Plus, if you act fast, the Millionaire Patriot will give you a free Springfield Armory XD pistol in the caliber of your choice.
[02:09:39.322 --> 02:09:45.407]  I believe now is the time for you and your family need to be armed and trained to levels that exceed law enforcement military standards.
[02:09:45.407 --> 02:09:56.775]  Front Sight provides such training without any boot camp or drill instructor attitudes, and the military patriot is paying his own money to help you get this.
[02:09:56.775 --> 02:09:57.836]  This is an awesome deal.
[02:09:57.836 --> 02:09:59.477]  Go to FrontSight.com.
[02:09:59.477 --> 02:10:03.801]  That's FrontSight.com, like the front of your rifle, FrontSight.com.
[02:10:04.401 --> 02:10:07.302]  Okay, going back to Mike Rivero.
[02:10:07.302 --> 02:10:13.523]  Mike, I want to go to at least Al, Mike, Tim and Joe, but you got cut off by a break earlier.
[02:10:13.523 --> 02:10:21.224]  Finish up the point that you were trying to make about Iran and where you see that going.
[02:10:21.224 --> 02:10:28.265]  I mean, this seems like a repeat of the exact propaganda we saw with Iraq in the lead up to the invasion seven years ago.
[02:10:28.265 --> 02:10:32.486]  They just replaced the last letter in Iraq
[02:10:33.146 --> 02:10:35.569]  They've removed the Q and put an N in.
[02:10:35.569 --> 02:10:36.851]  I mean, it's the same thing.
[02:10:36.851 --> 02:10:37.692]  They've got nukes.
[02:10:37.692 --> 02:10:39.254]  They've got WMDs.
[02:10:39.254 --> 02:10:41.637]  They're going to kill us.
[02:10:41.637 --> 02:10:48.386]  And that would also be the perfect distraction for the banking takeover, the police state, the depression we see here domestically.
[02:10:49.366 --> 02:10:50.247]  Yeah, absolutely.
[02:10:50.247 --> 02:10:54.750]  There are a lot of people who see a major war as their best solution.
[02:10:54.750 --> 02:11:03.477]  Right now, Obama and the Democrats are getting ready to run in November with the economy on their heads, the inability to change it, the unwillingness to change it.
[02:11:03.477 --> 02:11:10.563]  They're definitely dealing with the aftermath of the flotilla accident, of the flotilla attack and the Gulf oil accident.
[02:11:10.563 --> 02:11:13.926]  It's all bad news and I think the conventional wisdom
[02:11:14.546 --> 02:11:22.593]  Is that because the United States was able to get out of the crash of 1907 with World War I, the crash of 1929 with World War II.
[02:11:22.593 --> 02:11:28.539]  Here we are in the crash of 2007 and look how many countries we've invaded and are getting ready to invade.
[02:11:28.539 --> 02:11:35.925]  If we get a new war going in the Korean Peninsula, by definition that's a two-front war and that makes it a world war.
[02:11:35.925 --> 02:11:39.689]  They're rushing us into World War III because they can't think of anything better to do.
[02:11:41.533 --> 02:11:59.204]  Well said, and what really concerns me, what indicates that they are planning to go to war, not just their open statements that they are, but what indicates that this is more than just saber-rattling is that we see all these White House officials and Republican leaders openly talking about arresting citizens
[02:12:00.184 --> 02:12:03.786]  Because the Pentagon wants them arrested, or U.S.
[02:12:03.786 --> 02:12:08.108]  citizens being killed, and how the list is now in the hundreds.
[02:12:08.108 --> 02:12:09.268]  No judge, no jury.
[02:12:09.268 --> 02:12:12.850]  You're not just tortured, you're hunted down and killed.
[02:12:12.850 --> 02:12:20.153]  And now the open announcements of plans to start censoring the Internet, and to start shutting down free speech.
[02:12:20.153 --> 02:12:24.315]  I mean, they're openly saying Obama has a kill switch.
[02:12:24.315 --> 02:12:28.397]  They're openly saying they want to restrict, quote, conspiracy theories.
[02:12:28.897 --> 02:12:31.700]  Which is anything that criticizes the corrupt system.
[02:12:31.700 --> 02:12:35.024]  And so, they're getting it all lined up and ready.
[02:12:35.024 --> 02:12:38.489]  And people need to know, again, this is not a game.
[02:12:38.489 --> 02:12:39.390]  This is really happening.
[02:12:40.387 --> 02:12:52.675]  Well they're already doing it with their own TSA people and I guess they kind of got tired of all their employees reading on the internet how badly TSA is annoying people and messing people up and certainly they destroyed tourism here in Hawaii.
[02:12:52.675 --> 02:13:01.781]  So already the TSA is blocking their own internal networks from seeing websites like yours and mine or anything controversial or conspiratorial.
[02:13:01.781 --> 02:13:10.267]  So the idea is the government is now trying to protect their own people from seeing what's really going on with the country in order to try and hang on to that loyalty.
[02:13:10.367 --> 02:13:11.048]  A little bit longer.
[02:13:25.706 --> 02:13:33.674]  And Infowars.com, PrisonPlanet.com are blocked on the continent of Europe in many of the quote government Wi-Fi systems.
[02:13:33.674 --> 02:13:35.275]  They are blocked all over England.
[02:13:35.275 --> 02:13:36.496]  We've listed the systems.
[02:13:36.496 --> 02:13:43.523]  We've done screenshots of it because two of my writers are in London and they've written articles about it.
[02:13:43.523 --> 02:13:49.268]  And now they're basically saying, the FCC is saying, we're going to give you free broadband
[02:13:50.009 --> 02:13:57.278]  But anybody else who offers broadband is going to be under FCC control, and we're going to block what sites you can see.
[02:13:57.278 --> 02:14:04.566]  And the FCC, as you know Mike, two weeks ago came out and brazenly stated, this was in mainstream news, this is not just us saying this, that...
[02:14:05.347 --> 02:14:18.517]  You're gonna have software that basically acts as a black box on your TV, which is digital, and on your computer, that blocks what you can see, so it acts as a gatekeeper, but also surveils what you're doing.
[02:14:18.517 --> 02:14:23.161]  I mean, again, even Alex Jones, you know, Mr. Anti-New World Order.
[02:14:23.161 --> 02:14:28.465]  I'm shocked that we're actually at this precipice now, that they're actually announcing it.
[02:14:28.465 --> 02:14:34.990]  It's just brazen, naked, authoritarian, anti-American, Stalinistic crap.
[02:14:36.229 --> 02:14:39.730]  Well, they have to announce it because everybody sees that it's happening.
[02:14:39.730 --> 02:14:52.094]  What they're trying to do is convince everybody that it's for their own good, that they really ought not to be looking at these alternative news sites, because after all, trust the government, trust the corporate media, they would never lie to you.
[02:14:52.094 --> 02:14:54.195]  They're really fighting a losing battle here.
[02:14:54.195 --> 02:14:59.777]  And again, the historical perspective I like to use is Gutenberg and his movable type printing press.
[02:14:59.777 --> 02:15:02.198]  If you look at how the established power structure
[02:15:02.518 --> 02:15:08.163]  Reacted to that, you will see exactly the same reactions today against the blogs and the internet.
[02:15:08.163 --> 02:15:11.346]  And in the long run, it has to fail.
[02:15:11.346 --> 02:15:14.830]  In fact, I saw another Telegraph article today.
[02:15:14.830 --> 02:15:16.271]  Separately, I saw another U.S.
[02:15:16.271 --> 02:15:20.855]  newspaper report that, look, the corporate media is dying.
[02:15:20.855 --> 02:15:22.737]  The government is falling apart.
[02:15:22.737 --> 02:15:24.278]  They're trying to block the internet.
[02:15:24.278 --> 02:15:25.579]  It's not going to work.
[02:15:25.579 --> 02:15:27.701]  I mean, the minute they try to come in and block,
[02:15:28.447 --> 02:15:32.630]  The Drudge Report and Infowars.com and what really happened.
[02:15:32.630 --> 02:15:44.578]  Then that just makes all of us have a form of solidarity and basically stick together and it radicalizes even quote more mainline type media like Drudge Report.
[02:15:44.578 --> 02:15:46.159]  I mean look at the Drudge Report now.
[02:15:46.159 --> 02:15:49.481]  It reads many days like PrisonPlanet.com.
[02:15:49.481 --> 02:15:51.603]  I mean it is anti-New World Order.
[02:15:51.603 --> 02:15:53.064]  It admits the world government.
[02:15:53.604 --> 02:16:12.449]  It links to all the globalists making these admissions, it admits the globalists are trying to overthrow the country, that they're overthrowing the internet, and now I'm seeing more quote mainline or transitional media basically being radicalized as the White House would call it and just telling the truth.
[02:16:12.449 --> 02:16:13.469]  And so I think
[02:16:14.562 --> 02:16:16.123]  I think it's too little too late.
[02:16:16.123 --> 02:16:19.226]  I don't think they can put Humpty Dumpty back together again.
[02:16:19.226 --> 02:16:22.489]  I absolutely agree here and we've got a saying on a coffee cup around here.
[02:16:22.489 --> 02:16:27.573]  The fastest way to bring down a dictatorship is to force them to act like one where everybody can see it.
[02:16:27.573 --> 02:16:39.384]  And on the day that they try and shut down portions of the internet to protect the American people, I think that's going to be when the American people really wake up and realize we're living in the 21st century version of Nazi Germany.
[02:16:39.784 --> 02:16:54.481]  What did you think of, I don't know if you saw it, you probably did, there were a bunch of British news and European Union newspapers that reported in the last few days, we covered it yesterday, I'm going to get back into it in the next hour because I didn't spend enough time on it.
[02:16:55.302 --> 02:17:02.328]  Where they go, oh yeah, there are microphones everywhere in the street lamps hidden and we are listening to you.
[02:17:02.328 --> 02:17:10.095]  Well, I remember 11 years ago them putting the microphones in an Austin and saying that they were gunshot detectors, but they've never used them for that.
[02:17:11.036 --> 02:17:35.263]  And then, I went and search-engined, I remember it was like Dogpile at the time in 99, Google wasn't even around, I went and did an AltaVista or whatever search, and there was the company bragging that it's, we can listen to people at 200 yards away, and then send it through the software for keywords, and here are those very same companies, but the difference is now the government and the media are saying, okay,
[02:17:35.623 --> 02:17:38.845]  We are listening to you and analyzing your keywords.
[02:17:38.845 --> 02:17:46.952]  I mean, that is right out of 1984, where he's hiding in the woods, having sex with his girlfriend, and Big Brother's got the woods mic'd.
[02:17:46.952 --> 02:17:48.573]  I mean, this is, this is incredible.
[02:17:49.716 --> 02:17:55.479]  Well, you know, I remember it wasn't that long ago when people who were saying, you know, they can listen to you over your cell phone.
[02:17:55.479 --> 02:18:01.323]  That's the reason it's got a speakerphone mode is so that they can justify having a microphone that can hear the entire room.
[02:18:01.323 --> 02:18:02.844]  And people are saying that's nonsense.
[02:18:02.844 --> 02:18:06.606]  Now you've got the FBI admitting that, yeah, that's built into the cell phone system.
[02:18:06.606 --> 02:18:08.807]  They can turn on the microphone in your cell phone.
[02:18:08.807 --> 02:18:11.309]  You're carrying your own tracking and listening.
[02:18:11.309 --> 02:18:14.971]  Even when it's off, even when it's off, and then people have to remove the battery.
[02:18:14.971 --> 02:18:16.252]  You can't remove it with iPhones.
[02:18:17.299 --> 02:18:18.740]  That's exactly true.
[02:18:18.740 --> 02:18:26.846]  If you really want security, you have to walk away from your phone, or you have to put it in a box that blocks all radio signals.
[02:18:26.846 --> 02:18:42.658]  By the way, we do have a sponsor that has those LED shielding, and that's the way to go, because if you've got your cell phone by electrical equipment, every minute or two you hear a beep through your speaker system, and we went and looked it up, that is the GPS system pinging it to check your location.
[02:18:45.037 --> 02:18:49.619]  So they are able to basically listen to you, possibly even watch you through the cameras.
[02:18:49.619 --> 02:18:51.120]  It's set up to be that way.
[02:18:51.120 --> 02:18:53.861]  The government is obviously terrified of the American people.
[02:18:53.861 --> 02:18:59.423]  They're trying to figure out some way they can squeeze the last few pennies out of our pockets without triggering a revolution.
[02:18:59.423 --> 02:19:03.585]  Frankly, my readers and I are somewhat amazed that it hasn't started yet.
[02:19:03.585 --> 02:19:09.888]  But Mike, my concern is, and I want to hold you over for one more segment to take calls, my concern is, is that
[02:19:12.145 --> 02:19:13.386]  They want a revolution.
[02:19:13.386 --> 02:19:18.068]  They want it to be violent, because we're winning it with the hearts and minds.
[02:19:18.068 --> 02:19:23.791]  And if enough people wake up and realize just how illegitimate this system is, it'll fall on its own.
[02:19:23.791 --> 02:19:26.813]  That's my thought about this as well.
[02:19:26.813 --> 02:19:28.034]  That the U.S.
[02:19:28.034 --> 02:19:34.397]  is going to go the way of the U.S.S.R., and more and more people are beginning to write and contemplate that the U.S.
[02:19:34.397 --> 02:19:37.379]  is headed for a Soviet-style breakup, and I do think it's inevitable.
[02:19:40.134 --> 02:19:41.555]  Mike Rivero is our guest.
[02:19:41.555 --> 02:19:42.415]  We'll do one more segment.
[02:19:42.415 --> 02:19:46.937]  I'm going to get to everybody coming up here, but we're going to go quickly to your calls.
[02:19:46.937 --> 02:19:50.958]  Al, Mike, Tim, Joe, John, and others who are patiently listening.
[02:19:50.958 --> 02:19:52.719]  This is such important information.
[02:19:52.719 --> 02:19:55.440]  We are at a historical crossroads.
[02:19:55.440 --> 02:19:59.842]  I mean, the destiny of humanity, to a great extent, is being decided right now.
[02:20:01.442 --> 02:20:06.005]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[02:20:06.005 --> 02:20:06.905]  Number one.
[02:20:06.905 --> 02:20:10.327]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[02:20:10.327 --> 02:20:11.207]  Number two.
[02:20:11.207 --> 02:20:16.090]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[02:20:16.090 --> 02:20:16.830]  It's true.
[02:20:16.830 --> 02:20:21.373]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[02:20:21.693 --> 02:20:22.533]  Number 3.
[02:20:22.533 --> 02:20:26.115]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[02:20:26.115 --> 02:20:30.017]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[02:20:30.017 --> 02:20:30.817]  Number 4.
[02:20:30.817 --> 02:20:33.578]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[02:20:33.578 --> 02:20:37.260]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[02:20:37.260 --> 02:20:38.060]  Number 5.
[02:20:38.060 --> 02:20:41.922]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[02:20:42.202 --> 02:20:47.248]  Folks, I really believe in the solar-powered generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[02:20:47.248 --> 02:20:51.433]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[02:20:51.433 --> 02:20:53.215]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[02:20:53.215 --> 02:20:57.820]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun, so go to mysolarbackup.com or call 1-877-327-0365.
[02:21:02.037 --> 02:21:03.057]  Gold isn't for you?
[02:21:03.057 --> 02:21:08.599]  Ted Anderson, President of Midas Resources, one of the world's premier gold and precious metal investing firms.
[02:21:08.599 --> 02:21:09.139]  I get it.
[02:21:09.139 --> 02:21:18.763]  You wouldn't buy gold if you believed that the government is doing a great job, that the Fed will stop handing out trillions of dollars like bailout candy, that Social Security would be there for you.
[02:21:18.763 --> 02:21:19.903]  That's not what's happening.
[02:21:20.163 --> 02:21:28.630]  You might even pass on gold if the stimulus package wouldn't fuel inflation, or that the dollar wouldn't lose value, or that your retirement would be secure.
[02:21:28.630 --> 02:21:32.032]  If all looks rosy to you, then now is not the time to buy gold.
[02:21:32.032 --> 02:21:36.296]  For the realists, there have never been more sobering reasons to diversify with gold.
[02:21:36.296 --> 02:21:37.897]  Since 2001, the U.S.
[02:21:37.897 --> 02:21:41.860]  dollar index has tanked 30%, while gold has risen 300%.
[02:21:41.860 --> 02:21:45.463]  Right now, savvy investors are adding gold to their portfolios.
[02:21:45.663 --> 02:21:46.564]  You should too.
[02:21:46.564 --> 02:21:47.706]  Find out what they know.
[02:21:47.706 --> 02:21:51.031]  Call us and I'll send you 10 reasons why gold will do very well, free.
[02:21:51.031 --> 02:21:51.091]  800-686-2237.
[02:21:51.091 --> 02:21:51.431]  800-686-2237.
[02:21:51.431 --> 02:21:51.611]  That's 800-686-2237.
[02:22:01.576 --> 02:22:03.958]  They helped to create a New World Order.
[02:22:03.958 --> 02:22:06.281]  We are part of a New World Order.
[02:22:06.281 --> 02:22:09.504]  A New World Order based upon collective action.
[02:22:09.504 --> 02:22:14.609]  Invisible Empire is a damning indictment of the globalists through their own words and documents.
[02:22:14.609 --> 02:22:18.793]  The New World Order really is a tool for addressing a new world of possibilities.
[02:22:19.113 --> 02:22:21.456]  It means all the world under their control.
[02:22:21.456 --> 02:22:24.340]  The United Nations would take over America.
[02:22:24.340 --> 02:22:27.264]  The Trilateral Commission would control the world.
[02:22:27.264 --> 02:22:34.854]  Invisible Empire chronicles how men of power and influence have worked in stealth for centuries to establish an oppressive world government.
[02:22:35.194 --> 02:22:40.576]  I believe first of all that we now need nothing short of a world constitution for the global financial system.
[02:22:40.576 --> 02:22:43.436]  Global governance with the establishment of the G20.
[02:22:43.436 --> 02:22:47.117]  So it's going to be an inner ruling elite and then everyone else.
[02:22:47.117 --> 02:22:48.198]  And I got news for you.
[02:22:48.198 --> 02:22:49.538]  You're everyone else.
[02:22:49.538 --> 02:22:51.019]  Invisible Empire.

[02:23:01.041 --> 02:23:04.043]  You've seen our Sinofresh banner on the GCN website.
[02:23:04.043 --> 02:23:06.104]  Yet your sinusitis is still a problem.
[02:23:06.104 --> 02:23:08.866]  Are you waiting for your sinusitis to go away by itself?
[02:23:08.866 --> 02:23:11.088]  Are you waiting for a Sinofresh discount?
[02:23:11.088 --> 02:23:12.488]  Okay, here it comes.
[02:23:12.488 --> 02:23:14.390]  But first, the facts.
[02:23:14.390 --> 02:23:16.331]  67 other products merely treat symptoms.
[02:23:16.331 --> 02:23:18.312]  And not the cause of sinus problems.
[02:23:18.312 --> 02:23:22.015]  And 37 million Americans suffer from sinus distress just like you.
[02:23:22.015 --> 02:23:29.760]  But now many are finding relief with the only patent-protected homeopathic nasal product that antiseptically eliminates the known causes of sinusitis.
[02:23:29.760 --> 02:23:30.360]  Sinofresh.

[02:23:51.294 --> 02:23:51.494]  It works!
[02:24:10.871 --> 02:24:11.931]  Al in Delaware.
[02:24:11.931 --> 02:24:14.112]  What's on your mind today, Al?
[02:24:14.112 --> 02:24:15.093]  Hey, how you doing, Alex?
[02:24:15.093 --> 02:24:15.273]  Good, sir.
[02:24:15.273 --> 02:24:17.654]  I've been trying to get to you for a couple weeks.
[02:24:17.654 --> 02:24:20.695]  I've got a couple of questions for you.
[02:24:20.695 --> 02:24:27.157]  One, do you feel as though Obama has been cultivated for this for the last 25 years?
[02:24:29.642 --> 02:24:31.223]  Oh, there's no doubt, absolutely.
[02:24:31.223 --> 02:24:36.185]  His entire family was involved in foundations that are even above U.S.
[02:24:36.185 --> 02:24:37.426]  intelligence.
[02:24:37.426 --> 02:24:42.309]  And there's no doubt he's got intelligence ties, and he's been groomed for this.
[02:24:42.309 --> 02:24:46.291]  They tried to sell him as a messianic leader, but it didn't work.
[02:24:46.291 --> 02:24:47.011]  But that's fine.
[02:24:47.011 --> 02:24:52.494]  They're just as happy to destroy him and give us another messianic leader.
[02:24:52.494 --> 02:24:53.955]  Mike Rivera, what's your take on that?
[02:24:54.775 --> 02:24:56.357]  Yeah, absolutely.
[02:24:56.357 --> 02:25:06.587]  With the rare exception of people like Ron Paul, pretty much everybody offered to us on the voting menu every election is cultivated, trained, groomed, and manufactured from the ground up.
[02:25:06.587 --> 02:25:10.491]  There are very few real genuine candidates, like I said, Ron Paul being the exception.
[02:25:10.911 --> 02:25:12.853]  Yeah, they've been compromised so many times.
[02:25:12.853 --> 02:25:16.235]  I mean, this guy came from the Chicago machine.
[02:25:16.235 --> 02:25:27.605]  He was publicly incubated in the heart of the most hardcore mafia organization there with communist bombers and slumlords and mafiadons.
[02:25:27.605 --> 02:25:29.827]  I mean, just, he is hardcore mafia.
[02:25:31.028 --> 02:25:31.909]  And he's expanding wars.
[02:25:31.909 --> 02:25:32.009]  Yes.
[02:26:01.609 --> 02:26:24.704]  Do you guys believe that we are in crisis mode before these midterm elections come and do you think this man will have the audacity to actually suspend the elections and possibly use the southern states and the Gulf as a, as a, we know they're turning it into a tar pit.
[02:26:24.704 --> 02:26:25.044]  Come on.
[02:26:26.570 --> 02:26:31.717]  Do you believe that with the Queen coming here, was she signing documents?
[02:26:31.717 --> 02:26:33.380]  We're buddy-buddy with China.
[02:26:33.380 --> 02:26:34.862]  We're buddy-buddy with Russia.
[02:26:35.789 --> 02:26:44.833]  Is this the tipping point and should we start preparing for crisis mode in America before the elections?
[02:26:44.833 --> 02:26:48.795]  Well, I'm going to answer that in more detail in the next segment because I'm actually getting into that.
[02:26:48.795 --> 02:26:55.278]  But you should always prepare for crises because what government has shown us is it can't and it won't protect us.
[02:26:55.278 --> 02:26:56.738]  We've got to protect ourselves.
[02:26:56.738 --> 02:27:02.361]  But yes, I see this confluence, all these different factors coming together where
[02:27:03.041 --> 02:27:14.866]  I literally catch my breath sometimes now and am just shocked to my core that I can intellectually see it, but also in my gut, in my spirit, I can feel the disturbance.
[02:27:14.866 --> 02:27:21.408]  To use a Star Wars line, you know, the last time I felt the disturbance in the Force was in the presence of my old master.
[02:27:21.408 --> 02:27:23.269]  Let's get a comment from Mike Rivera on that.
[02:27:24.028 --> 02:27:24.969]  Yeah, absolutely.
[02:27:24.969 --> 02:27:37.667]  I think more and more people are just realizing on a gut level, even if they can't analyze it, even if they can't intellectualize it, in their gut they know something is really changing about this country and how it's run and how it's organized.
[02:27:37.667 --> 02:27:38.808]  And again,
[02:27:39.489 --> 02:27:49.992]  I think it's because of shows like yours, Alex, and websites like both of ours, that we've panicked the New World Orderists into this last desperate push to try and achieve their agenda.
[02:27:49.992 --> 02:27:57.074]  Because I think, left to themselves, they would have preferred a more leisurely transition that didn't call as much attention to themselves.
[02:27:57.074 --> 02:28:02.016]  But I think they realize that if they're not able to make it happen now, that the whole thing is going to fall flat on their face.
[02:28:02.236 --> 02:28:11.345]  And these guys are confident, they're smart, they work hard, they've studied tyranny, they admit they've studied it, and they're not accustomed to losing, and they're very bold.
[02:28:11.345 --> 02:28:21.895]  And so, everything we do now, gathering our forces, illuminating these enemies, exposing them as the tyrants, not their Obama puppet or their Republican puppets,
[02:28:23.237 --> 02:28:29.021]  That is key because if people think the battle's joined right now, they haven't seen anything yet.
[02:28:29.021 --> 02:28:40.208]  This is only going to get crazier from here on out and it is every person you reach out to now is going to be a game changer, is going to be a deciding element
[02:28:41.028 --> 02:28:42.570]  In this unfolding situation.
[02:28:42.570 --> 02:28:45.073]  Al, I appreciate your call.
[02:28:45.073 --> 02:28:46.634]  And we'll come back and take more calls.
[02:28:46.634 --> 02:28:47.856]  We're going to let Mike go now.
[02:28:47.856 --> 02:28:50.138]  But Mike, I appreciate you joining us.
[02:28:50.138 --> 02:28:51.319]  But do you concur with me?
[02:28:51.319 --> 02:28:53.201]  Or do you agree?
[02:28:53.201 --> 02:28:55.704]  Disagree?
[02:28:55.704 --> 02:28:56.165]  You said it.
[02:28:56.165 --> 02:28:57.186]  You can feel it in your gut.
[02:28:57.898 --> 02:28:59.199]  Yeah, absolutely.
[02:28:59.199 --> 02:29:01.682]  We're in a period of tremendous change.
[02:29:01.682 --> 02:29:09.910]  And what you said before, the best thing that any of us can do is speak out publicly, because then you give courage to other people to speak out publicly.
[02:29:09.910 --> 02:29:15.356]  And the illusion that those of us who know there's a problem is a minority, that gets destroyed.
[02:29:15.356 --> 02:29:19.060]  And America stands up and says, yeah, something's gone really, really wrong with this country.
[02:29:19.460 --> 02:29:40.953]  Yeah, Ron Paul said it over and over again from studying history, I concur that the danger point is when they go into their period of globalist takeover, their artificial change, the danger point for us is not being pre-positioned with an alternative to defeat them and letting them use the crisis to bring in another level of tyranny.
[02:29:42.013 --> 02:29:44.075]  So it's a danger point for them and us.
[02:29:44.075 --> 02:29:45.836]  We've got to be in there now.
[02:29:45.836 --> 02:29:49.179]  History is in a flux vortex, basically, right now.
[02:29:49.179 --> 02:29:50.180]  Mike, great hearing from you.
[02:29:50.180 --> 02:29:51.601]  Thanks for joining us.
[02:29:51.601 --> 02:29:52.982]  We're on the march.
[02:29:52.982 --> 02:29:55.525]  The Empire's on the run.
[02:29:55.525 --> 02:29:58.207]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:00.725 --> 02:30:05.288]  This is Alex Jones with 5 good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[02:30:05.288 --> 02:30:06.209]  Number 1.
[02:30:06.209 --> 02:30:09.632]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[02:30:09.632 --> 02:30:10.492]  Number 2.
[02:30:10.492 --> 02:30:15.376]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[02:30:15.376 --> 02:30:16.116]  It's true.
[02:30:16.116 --> 02:30:21.000]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[02:30:21.000 --> 02:30:21.821]  Number 3.
[02:30:21.821 --> 02:30:25.403]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[02:30:25.403 --> 02:30:29.106]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[02:30:29.306 --> 02:30:30.107]  Number 4.
[02:30:30.107 --> 02:30:32.869]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[02:30:32.869 --> 02:30:36.553]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[02:30:36.553 --> 02:30:37.334]  Number 5.
[02:30:37.334 --> 02:30:41.497]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[02:30:41.497 --> 02:30:46.242]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[02:30:46.522 --> 02:30:50.704]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[02:30:50.704 --> 02:30:52.484]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[02:30:52.484 --> 02:30:54.725]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun.

[02:31:00.495 --> 02:31:04.698]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones asking you for a minute of your time to tell you about soap.
[02:31:04.698 --> 02:31:11.103]  Not detergents, but good old-fashioned pure soap made by the Calbin Soap Company, a family-owned and operated American company.
[02:31:11.103 --> 02:31:18.489]  My family, staff, friends, and radio listeners are constantly telling me how much they love these products for bath, hair, laundry, and dishes.
[02:31:18.489 --> 02:31:23.373]  There is nothing like these factory-direct, big-money-saving, triple-concentrated soaps anywhere.

[02:31:32.022 --> 02:31:35.747]  Let's talk to the owner of 5 Star Soap, Marty Schachter, and see what he has to say.
[02:31:36.280 --> 02:31:43.045]  As founder and owner for over 63 years, people keep asking me, how's business?
[02:31:43.045 --> 02:31:46.928]  I'm happy to say our business is going down the drain.
[02:31:46.928 --> 02:31:55.014]  Call us at 1-800-340-7091 or visit our website 5starsoap.com for buying a 1 to 2 month soap sampler.
[02:31:55.014 --> 02:31:55.955]  Thank you.
[02:31:55.955 --> 02:31:58.276]  You may be arrested and or subject to
[02:32:04.375 --> 02:32:05.615]  Tyranny is here.
[02:32:05.615 --> 02:32:09.557]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[02:32:09.557 --> 02:32:11.777]  It really says that the state is God.
[02:32:11.777 --> 02:32:17.659]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on Earth.
[02:32:17.659 --> 02:32:24.321]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps, now being expanded nationwide.
[02:32:24.321 --> 02:32:30.303]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful shadow state.
[02:32:30.303 --> 02:32:34.004]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depth to which our Republic has fallen.
[02:32:34.464 --> 02:32:38.767]  Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship.
[02:32:38.767 --> 02:32:44.711]  Body scanners, sound cannons, citizen spies, stage terror and cameras on every street corner.
[02:32:44.711 --> 02:32:48.273]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[02:32:48.273 --> 02:32:50.234]  The police state isn't coming.
[02:32:50.234 --> 02:32:51.375]  It's here.

[02:33:09.274 --> 02:33:13.156]  Okay, we've got an hour and 27 minutes left in broadcast.
[02:33:13.156 --> 02:33:16.958]  I've got a bunch of audio and video clips I want to play next hour and break down.
[02:33:16.958 --> 02:33:19.420]  First, I wanted to just run through some of the headlines.
[02:33:19.420 --> 02:33:19.880]  Look at this.
[02:33:19.880 --> 02:33:21.841]  Turkey wants Israeli apology.
[02:33:21.841 --> 02:33:24.143]  Israel rejects demand.
[02:33:24.143 --> 02:33:26.724]  That's out of Reuters.
[02:33:26.724 --> 02:33:30.847]  And whether you're pro-Israel or anti-Israel or whatever,
[02:33:31.667 --> 02:33:34.089]  Yeah, you know, Turkey had some of its citizens on board.
[02:33:34.089 --> 02:33:35.791]  It was a Turkish ship.
[02:33:35.791 --> 02:33:41.316]  And they just want some kind of half-hearted, face-saving apology to say it could have been handled a little better.
[02:33:41.316 --> 02:33:43.098]  And Israel won't do that.
[02:33:43.098 --> 02:33:44.239]  Very arrogant.
[02:33:44.239 --> 02:33:45.740]  And that's a huge escalation.
[02:33:45.740 --> 02:33:51.185]  And Netanyahu, of course, met with Obama today, trying to push the U.S.
[02:33:51.185 --> 02:33:53.387]  to launch an attack on Iran.
[02:33:53.387 --> 02:33:54.569]  Either way you slice it,
[02:33:55.509 --> 02:34:00.311]  This is going to be used as a political diversion for the banking takeover that's happening here domestically.
[02:34:00.311 --> 02:34:02.091]  Meanwhile, look at the federal government.
[02:34:02.091 --> 02:34:07.753]  One of the few things the federal government is supposed to do under the Constitution is issue the currency and credit.
[02:34:07.753 --> 02:34:08.814]  They don't do that.
[02:34:08.814 --> 02:34:10.374]  Private banks do.
[02:34:10.374 --> 02:34:11.695]  And it's protect our borders.
[02:34:11.695 --> 02:34:12.935]  They don't do that.
[02:34:12.935 --> 02:34:15.616]  Illegal immigration costs the U.S.
[02:34:15.616 --> 02:34:17.397]  $113 billion a year of study fines.
[02:34:17.397 --> 02:34:18.717]  That's out of Fox News, folks.
[02:34:18.717 --> 02:34:21.218]  It's far worse than that.
[02:34:21.218 --> 02:34:22.979]  We'll be going over that more later.
[02:34:24.626 --> 02:34:33.821]  Also, there is another report today here out of the Associated Press that feds the final lawsuit over Arizona immigration law.
[02:34:34.850 --> 02:34:39.391]  And, you know, this was a rumor a month ago, and now it's not a rumor.
[02:34:39.391 --> 02:35:01.795]  And it was a rumor two weeks ago that Obama's talking about signing an executive order to legalize illegals, and now White House is starting to put out some releases saying, well, we're looking at an executive order to basically order ICE to leave people alone inside the U.S., which is another act of treason.
[02:35:01.795 --> 02:35:03.375]  There's no other country in the world that just
[02:35:04.813 --> 02:35:05.974]  Has completely open borders.
[02:35:21.681 --> 02:35:23.381]  Amazing.
[02:35:23.381 --> 02:35:26.982]  And also the San Francisco Chronicle.
[02:35:26.982 --> 02:35:28.882]  This is a San Francisco Chronicle.
[02:35:28.882 --> 02:35:31.263]  This is Yobi Benjamin wrote this.
[02:35:31.263 --> 02:35:32.243]  And we have the clips.
[02:35:32.243 --> 02:35:33.343]  We don't have time to play it.
[02:35:33.343 --> 02:35:35.024]  Fox, CNN, you name it.
[02:35:35.024 --> 02:35:39.425]  It's all up on InfoWars and Present Planet if you want to go watch the full clips.
[02:35:39.425 --> 02:35:46.706]  With Anderson Cooper and other CNN hosts saying, yes, there's a form of martial law in the Gulf.
[02:35:46.706 --> 02:35:49.607]  And yes, there's no First Amendment.
[02:35:49.607 --> 02:35:50.827]  And yes, it's a felony.
[02:35:51.926 --> 02:35:52.846]  I mean, look at this headline.
[02:35:52.846 --> 02:35:56.408]  BP and Coast Guard bans all media access to spill.
[02:35:56.408 --> 02:35:57.828]  This happened Monday.
[02:35:57.828 --> 02:36:00.149]  Boom cleanup sites and workers.
[02:36:00.149 --> 02:36:09.033]  Under threat of federal felony, National Incident Commander Thad Allen has banned all media access to boom operation sites and cleanup sites.
[02:36:09.033 --> 02:36:11.334]  Now, before they even had this, quote, ban.
[02:36:11.334 --> 02:36:17.037]  And this is a order by the Coast Guard, by an admiral.
[02:36:17.037 --> 02:36:17.917]  This is martial law.
[02:36:20.643 --> 02:36:26.647]  Allen's orders effectively bans all media, print, television, radio, internet bloggers.
[02:36:26.647 --> 02:36:28.568]  And it just goes on.
[02:36:28.568 --> 02:36:34.451]  And then here's CNN's Anderson Cooper reveals full media restrictions and access by Coast Guard.
[02:36:34.451 --> 02:36:40.294]  And that video, they tell you the First Amendment is now dead.
[02:36:40.294 --> 02:36:42.556]  They are just throwing this in our face here.
[02:36:42.556 --> 02:36:45.317]  And now tar balls are hitting Texas as of yesterday.
[02:36:45.317 --> 02:36:47.939]  And these are gigantic, huge tar balls.
[02:36:49.588 --> 02:36:52.389]  Because that oil comes out of the ground 5,000 feet under.
[02:36:52.389 --> 02:36:55.290]  It's freezing cold down there.
[02:36:55.290 --> 02:36:58.571]  And it congeals.
[02:36:58.571 --> 02:37:02.653]  And some people are saying, well, tar balls are always hitting the Texas coast.
[02:37:02.653 --> 02:37:02.913]  I don't know.
[02:37:02.913 --> 02:37:05.854]  The oil industry has been pretty clean the last decade.
[02:37:05.854 --> 02:37:07.115]  I go down to the beach a lot.
[02:37:07.115 --> 02:37:10.396]  Galveston, Port Aransas, you name it, you rarely see tar balls.
[02:37:10.396 --> 02:37:12.157]  And these tar balls are gigantic.
[02:37:12.157 --> 02:37:14.497]  And it probably did come from the oil spill, but who knows.
[02:37:16.238 --> 02:37:27.907]  But don't worry, Tony Blair, the globalist who killed Magna Carta and the British rights, Tony Blair has been tapped to take over chairman of Crisis Hit BP.
[02:37:27.907 --> 02:37:31.470]  Don't worry, Tony Blair to the rescue.
[02:37:31.470 --> 02:37:36.914]  And then we have a detailed article up on PrisonPlanet.com by Paul Watson.
[02:37:36.914 --> 02:37:40.577]  Despite rumors, officials insist no Gulf evacuation planned yet.
[02:37:41.297 --> 02:37:45.580]  But what happens when 150 plus million gallons gets blown in by the hurricanes?
[02:37:45.580 --> 02:37:52.284]  And we do have a CFR member in the Washington Post saying he believes 20 million will be evacuated.
[02:37:52.284 --> 02:37:57.747]  And so very, very serious situation on that front.
[02:37:57.747 --> 02:38:04.471]  And then separately, USA Today expect lots of government layoffs at state, local level, but not federal.
[02:38:04.471 --> 02:38:07.093]  Their pay's going up and their numbers are growing.
[02:38:07.093 --> 02:38:09.094]  And the police are becoming federalized everywhere.
[02:38:10.199 --> 02:38:16.965]  Here's CNBC, Dow repeats Great Depression pattern.
[02:38:16.965 --> 02:38:19.748]  Here is another one.
[02:38:19.748 --> 02:38:24.472]  With US trapped in depression, this really is starting to feel like 1932.
[02:38:24.472 --> 02:38:25.333]  London Telegraph.
[02:38:25.333 --> 02:38:32.779]  So, the establishment has engineered this depression, but now they're admitting that it's a depression and offering you their solutions.
[02:38:32.779 --> 02:38:34.120]  Folks, you cannot
[02:38:34.841 --> 02:38:49.388]  Depend on government to protect yourself with looming war with Iran that could lead to World War 3, with the Gulf oil coming in, with all of this happening, with the depression we're in, with almost everyone I know being laid off or having their pay cut.
[02:38:49.388 --> 02:38:52.409]  This is serious business.
[02:38:52.409 --> 02:39:00.073]  And that's why I wanted to bring the owner of the J. Michael Stevens Group, efoodsdirect.com, up for the rest of this segment.
[02:39:01.417 --> 02:39:04.079]  Because the time of screwing around is over.
[02:39:04.079 --> 02:39:12.466]  You need firearms, you need food, you need water filters, and the place to get your storable food is efoodsdirect.com.
[02:39:12.466 --> 02:39:28.019]  And because they make it new every month, it's non-GMO, non-hybrid, they've got a lot of different variants, ready-to-eat, gourmet meals, they've got the raw base stuff, it's everything you need, one-stop shop, free shipping, so all the money that you put into the food
[02:39:28.760 --> 02:39:29.180]  Go to
[02:39:47.105 --> 02:39:48.746]  This has been done by design.
[02:39:48.746 --> 02:39:54.431]  I wanted to bring up Steve Schenck because he's doing a July 4th special that runs through July 14th.
[02:39:54.431 --> 02:40:02.617]  Free shipping on Storable Food is a giant discount, folks, because shipping is one of the main costs because it is bulky.
[02:40:02.617 --> 02:40:03.858]  Steve Schenck, thanks for coming on with us.
[02:40:04.994 --> 02:40:20.386]  Well Alex, all that you've just been summarizing here for your listeners is just way beyond the pale of what I'd ever expect that we'd see in the United States of America, but you're absolutely right on.
[02:40:20.386 --> 02:40:32.115]  And as this whole mess develops, it becomes more and more incumbent on every individual to look to their own independence and their own freedom.
[02:40:33.056 --> 02:40:48.502]  And the first great dependency, obviously, you and I have talked about it hundreds and hundreds of times, is the fact that the greatest dependency and the greatest step that anybody can take is to make sure they've got food to get through this thing.
[02:40:49.242 --> 02:40:52.883]  And now something else has just raised its absolutely ugly head.
[02:40:52.883 --> 02:41:12.370]  We've got hundreds of people calling us wanting to put in food for their evacuation because notwithstanding the fact that we're getting news media coverage that says there might be one, the people that are living in the middle of this thing, Alex, know that they are going to have to get out.
[02:41:12.370 --> 02:41:16.612]  And one of the things that was brought up by several of these folks
[02:41:17.535 --> 02:41:30.931]  And that's what prompted this free shipping, this 10 days of free shipping, and this is huge, is the fact that people are saying, you know, Steve, we need food to evacuate.
[02:41:30.931 --> 02:41:34.816]  We need these quick two-week packs or whatever that we order.
[02:41:36.738 --> 02:41:46.802]  And if there aren't mass evacuations in your area, or if by a miracle none of this ever happens, as the media starts hyping it, then you've got food insurance you can eat.
[02:41:46.802 --> 02:41:49.403]  But, I mean, look at the facts here.
[02:41:49.403 --> 02:41:53.725]  Hundreds of millions of gallons dumped in the Gulf, over 150 million conservatively.
[02:41:53.725 --> 02:41:55.126]  They're not letting people clean it up.
[02:41:55.866 --> 02:42:04.851]  I mean, I have seen CNN admit that almost everyone, over 95% of people that worked on the Exxon Valdez are dead.
[02:42:04.851 --> 02:42:15.277]  The average life expectancy is 51 when it's over 75 for somebody who isn't around the benzene and the heavy metals and the off-gassing.
[02:42:15.277 --> 02:42:20.699]  And BP won't even let their own employees wear masks because then they'd have to admit it was toxic.
[02:42:21.940 --> 02:42:24.160]  They're not letting the media cover it.
[02:42:24.160 --> 02:42:36.603]  A state of martial law now exists in the Gulf, and so I was calling people fear mongers a month ago that were saying this, but now I've got to say, okay, this is starting to get a lot of validity here.
[02:42:36.603 --> 02:42:43.484]  Just another reason for people to stop counting on the government and to get storable food today.
[02:42:43.484 --> 02:42:46.885]  Well, the thing, Alex, that people aren't thinking of, and this
[02:42:47.654 --> 02:42:53.339]  This has been brought to our attention in the last two weeks just tremendously.
[02:42:53.339 --> 02:43:09.654]  We've got people calling in and they're saying, hey, we need a small supply ship to where we are, but we've got to get, you know, we're planning with relatives or whoever, wherever we're planning to evacuate to, those people can't feed us.
[02:43:10.539 --> 02:43:16.763]  And if it's going to be a couple hundred miles away or a couple thousand miles away, it doesn't matter.
[02:43:16.763 --> 02:43:19.384]  What we're having are double orders.
[02:43:19.384 --> 02:43:25.908]  People are ordering a small amount to get them evacuated, and then they're ordering for their destination point.
[02:43:25.908 --> 02:43:34.973]  That doubles the shipping that people have to have, and so we had a board meeting last week and decided the thing that we had to do is we've got to help somehow.
[02:43:35.603 --> 02:43:56.648]  Now, you know from working with us before that we've got more of a better quality food for less money than anything else people can do, but we have decided that for these 10 days, folks must get in their immediate supply, but the big supply that they need to have is at their destination location, and we're covering shipping to both places.
[02:43:57.448 --> 02:44:00.849]  Well, Steve, you've been doing this for decades and decades.
[02:44:00.849 --> 02:44:07.911]  There are people that claim that they've been around longer than you or claim that they're better than you, but I bought from a lot of different places.
[02:44:07.911 --> 02:44:09.411]  I did a lot of research.
[02:44:09.411 --> 02:44:12.992]  You've got the best quality food, the freshest, the best prices.
[02:44:12.992 --> 02:44:16.353]  That's why you're probably the biggest outfit in the country.
[02:44:16.353 --> 02:44:18.213]  There's a lot of people selling 5, 10, 15-year-old government MREs.
[02:44:21.534 --> 02:44:24.518]  And you know, quite frankly, that's very immoral.
[02:44:24.518 --> 02:44:26.059]  I feel good promoting you.
[02:44:26.059 --> 02:44:29.964]  I know this is fresh, new, non-GMO, non-hybrid.
[02:44:29.964 --> 02:44:32.006]  I know you've got the widest selection.
[02:44:32.006 --> 02:44:33.448]  I know you're the best.
[02:44:33.448 --> 02:44:35.430]  And just in these uncertain times,
[02:44:36.351 --> 02:44:37.131]  It's a no-brainer.
[02:44:37.131 --> 02:44:54.461]  I mean, my reason for having storable food, and really increasing the amount three years ago, and so tripling the amount of food I'd previously bought from you, so every one of my family has a three-year supply, my attic and garage just jam-packed full of it, my reason for doing that was the Depression.
[02:44:54.461 --> 02:45:04.667]  Because I know that during the Depression, 90% of people were rural, but still, major universities report that over seven million people in that decade
[02:45:05.547 --> 02:45:05.907]  Starved
[02:45:22.282 --> 02:45:22.522]  That's
[02:45:42.071 --> 02:45:43.873]  I'm not going to be dependent on the UN.
[02:45:43.873 --> 02:45:45.955]  These bankers want me to be dependent on them.
[02:45:45.955 --> 02:45:54.103]  That's why I got storable food, and that's why I researched it and bought from you and found that it was good, so I went and approached you to be a sponsor, and that's why you're our sponsor.
[02:45:54.103 --> 02:46:00.630]  And there's a lot of other, I don't want to name names, but some of the same people that have sponsors that shell gold and a franc's 360 bucks and Midas has it for 250.
[02:46:03.132 --> 02:46:15.082]  Some of those same talk show hosts have food crowds that sell stuff for twice what you sell it for, and I just want to put people in the direction of someone I know is good, and that I trust, and I have confidence in.
[02:46:15.082 --> 02:46:24.851]  So Steve, tell folks about some of the food packages you've got, and people have another, you know, 10 days or so, or 9 days, to take advantage of free shipping, which is just an amazing discount.
[02:46:25.748 --> 02:46:39.838]  Well, the basic units are always there, the dehydrated foods that last, you know, the 20 years and all of this, and that people can cook from scratch, and it virtually is the mainstay that people are putting in.
[02:46:39.838 --> 02:46:49.385]  But this new, new traversal line that we've got, which are all recipes put together, very literally, a one-year supply of this new traversal that
[02:46:49.825 --> 02:46:56.867]  All you do is just bring water to a boil and all these meals are designed so a ten-year-old can prepare it.
[02:46:56.867 --> 02:47:03.809]  Very simply, a one-year supply for one adult will still fit in one cubic yard of space.
[02:47:03.809 --> 02:47:18.273]  And so the fact is that right now we've got not only the nation struggling with what probably about 36 to 38 percent of our population right now goes to the grocery store.
[02:47:19.395 --> 02:47:23.136]  And has to decide whether they're going to pay their bills or buy food.
[02:47:23.136 --> 02:47:28.717]  We've got so many people on food stamps that they say it's something like coming up on 60 million.
[02:47:28.717 --> 02:47:30.277]  Well, it was 40, then 45.
[02:47:30.277 --> 02:47:33.018]  They project within another year it could be 60 million.
[02:47:33.018 --> 02:47:35.098]  And of course, we know the government plays down numbers.
[02:47:35.098 --> 02:47:42.940]  They say unemployment has gone down from 10 to 9.4 when all the private groups say it's above 23 percentage points.
[02:47:43.320 --> 02:47:51.146]  So, you can't believe anything that comes out of the government, but I mean, we're talking about, what, 20% of the United States on food stamps.
[02:47:51.146 --> 02:47:52.587]  I mean, this is insane.
[02:47:52.587 --> 02:48:03.816]  Again, ladies and gentlemen, the media has been trying to cover it up, but there are giant tent cities from Texas to California out to Hawaii.
[02:48:03.816 --> 02:48:11.822]  Ladies and gentlemen, I hope you never have to use this food, and then if five years from now this doesn't happen, you can eat your investment and it tastes really good.
[02:48:12.142 --> 02:48:15.384]  But unfortunately, I think you're going to end up having to use this.
[02:48:15.384 --> 02:48:18.667]  And look, it's way past time to get to horrible food.
[02:48:18.667 --> 02:48:23.650]  You don't want to wait until the collapse is completely evident, and then it's going to be hard to get food.
[02:48:23.650 --> 02:48:28.113]  It's getting harder and harder with the prices going up that Steve talked about a few years ago.
[02:48:28.113 --> 02:48:30.375]  We're now seeing it with staples going up.
[02:48:30.375 --> 02:48:32.556]  It's been hard for Steve to keep prices down.
[02:48:32.556 --> 02:48:34.138]  This is really a mission with Steve.
[02:48:34.138 --> 02:48:37.020]  I mean, he's doing this because he believes in it.
[02:48:37.020 --> 02:48:38.801]  Just like I believe in what I'm doing.
[02:48:39.441 --> 02:48:46.447]  Steve, again, give folks the number and the website so they can check this out and not screw around anymore.
[02:48:46.447 --> 02:48:50.831]  Okay, the phone number for those who can't get up and do the internet thing is 800-409-5633.
[02:48:50.831 --> 02:48:51.031]  That's 800-409-5633.
[02:48:51.031 --> 02:48:55.755]  And that's free shipping on all of the eFoodsDirect products, the prepared ones as well as the long-term storables.
[02:49:06.484 --> 02:49:08.225]  And that will run until the 14th of July.
[02:49:22.513 --> 02:49:44.194]  Uh, but please make sure on efoodsdirect.com when you do your calculations, not only have food shipped to yourself if you are in danger of a possible evacuation, but make sure that you get an evacuation route, find a destination for you to land your family, agree with those people that they can accept you and have
[02:49:44.955 --> 02:49:51.580]  And have another batch of food, your large batch of food that you're going to have to survive on, shipped to that destination.
[02:49:51.580 --> 02:50:04.649]  We'll pay both shippings, the one to your present location to get out of Dodge, and then for your final location, we'll handle all shipping on all eFoods Direct products for the next 10 days.
[02:50:06.310 --> 02:50:07.891]  800-409-5633.
[02:50:07.891 --> 02:50:25.882]  My concern is that even if the oil doesn't blow into shore, which it's forecast to do with the hurricane season starting and Obama openly blocking any cleanup effort, is that they'll just use it as an excuse to make people evacuate from areas to set that precedent.
[02:50:25.882 --> 02:50:26.823]  I mean, this is their
[02:50:27.543 --> 02:50:28.184]  Mindset.
[02:50:28.184 --> 02:50:29.886]  This is their methodology.
[02:50:29.886 --> 02:50:31.027]  I've learned what they do.
[02:50:31.027 --> 02:50:35.912]  And now we have these quotes from Obama and Emmanuel about using crises.
[02:50:35.912 --> 02:50:37.775]  I mean, it's terrorism.
[02:50:37.775 --> 02:50:40.097]  And folks, I believe in self-sufficiency.
[02:50:40.097 --> 02:50:42.380]  I believe in rugged individualism.
[02:50:42.380 --> 02:50:43.741]  I believe you need firearms.
[02:50:44.662 --> 02:50:52.413]  I mean, how many sheriffs have come out in the last year and said, buy guns, we're having to lay off more than half the sheriff's department, crime is exploding.
[02:50:52.413 --> 02:50:53.734]  I mean, you know, it's common sense.
[02:50:53.734 --> 02:50:55.677]  Buy food, buy guns, be ready.
[02:50:55.677 --> 02:50:58.521]  This is High Quality Food, eFoodsDirect.com.
[02:50:58.521 --> 02:51:00.163]  We're gonna come back, final comments with him.
[02:51:00.163 --> 02:51:00.624]  Stay with us.
[02:51:01.798 --> 02:51:06.084]  Is there a favorite radio station or show that you just love and can't stand to miss?
[02:51:06.084 --> 02:51:08.267]  Then you need Replay AV.
[02:51:08.267 --> 02:51:17.240]  With Replay AV, you can set up your PC to record your favorite radio shows, podcasts, XM and Sirius radio feeds, even streaming video automatically.
[02:51:17.240 --> 02:51:18.142]  More than one favorite?
[02:51:18.382 --> 02:51:19.223]  No problem!
[02:51:19.223 --> 02:51:23.229]  Replay AV can simultaneously record multiple shows and stations.
[02:51:23.229 --> 02:51:26.534]  You never have to miss any of your favorite programs again.
[02:51:26.534 --> 02:51:34.286]  Replay AV comes with a built-in media guide to make it easy to find your favorites and a converter for playback in any of the popular formats.
[02:51:34.406 --> 02:51:35.186]  We're good to go.
[02:52:03.865 --> 02:52:06.006]  Subject to other police action.
[02:52:06.006 --> 02:52:07.266]  Tyranny is here.
[02:52:07.266 --> 02:52:10.907]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[02:52:10.907 --> 02:52:13.428]  It really says that the state is God.
[02:52:13.428 --> 02:52:19.289]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on Earth.
[02:52:19.289 --> 02:52:25.531]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps, now being expanded nationwide.
[02:52:25.951 --> 02:52:31.934]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful shadow state.
[02:52:31.934 --> 02:52:36.095]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depths to which our republic has fallen.
[02:52:36.095 --> 02:52:40.397]  Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship.
[02:52:40.397 --> 02:52:46.359]  Body scanners, sound cameras, citizen spies, stage terror, and cameras on every street corner.
[02:52:46.359 --> 02:52:49.901]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[02:52:49.901 --> 02:52:51.882]  The police state isn't coming.
[02:52:51.882 --> 02:52:52.322]  It's here.

[02:53:00.948 --> 02:53:02.728]  Normal blood pressure, naturally.
[02:53:02.728 --> 02:53:04.069]  How would that make you feel?
[02:53:04.069 --> 02:53:05.789]  I'm Don from New Mexico.
[02:53:05.789 --> 02:53:08.330]  January of 2000, I had a heart attack.
[02:53:08.330 --> 02:53:15.892]  Then my real health began going downhill, and I had high blood pressure, high blood sugar, poor vision, and I really wasn't sleeping well.
[02:53:15.892 --> 02:53:17.392]  I was a mess, pretty much.
[02:53:17.392 --> 02:53:20.133]  Don reports dramatic improvements with hardened body extract.
[02:53:20.133 --> 02:53:25.434]  I started taking hardened body extract, and from within a few days, I started sleeping a lot better.
[02:53:25.434 --> 02:53:30.515]  My blood pressure normalized, my blood sugar normalized, and my sleep really did improve.
[02:53:30.675 --> 02:53:35.779]  Experience these benefits and more when your body gets what it needs with the assistance of Heart and Body Extract.
[02:53:35.779 --> 02:53:40.203]  Order at HBextract.com or call 866-295-5305.
[02:53:40.203 --> 02:53:45.487]  That's HBextract.com or call 866-295-5305.
[02:53:45.487 --> 02:53:48.269]  Folks, I did not expect this at all.
[02:53:48.269 --> 02:53:52.993]  By the 7th, 8th, and 9th day, I saw dramatic improvements from taking Heart and Body Extract.
[02:53:52.993 --> 02:53:57.036]  Details at HBextract.com or call 866-295-5305 for Heart and Body Extract.
[02:54:03.030 --> 02:54:08.854]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[02:54:08.854 --> 02:54:12.177]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[02:54:12.177 --> 02:54:14.859]  Steve Schenck leaves us here in just a few minutes and this is what I'm going to do.
[02:54:14.859 --> 02:54:18.602]  I'm going to take call after call for the first 30 minutes of the next hour.
[02:54:18.602 --> 02:54:22.765]  Then I've got a few video and audio clips and a bunch of news I want to at least hit on briefly.
[02:54:22.765 --> 02:54:24.546]  And I will keep to that schedule.
[02:54:24.546 --> 02:54:28.729]  Everybody that's been holding will be getting to you when the next hour starts here in about five minutes.
[02:54:28.729 --> 02:54:28.769]  1-800-259
[02:54:31.331 --> 02:54:31.791]  I don't know.
[02:54:49.696 --> 02:54:59.478]  Steve Shank from the J. Michael Stevens Group, www.efoodsdirect.com forward slash free ship to take advantage of this or 800-409-5633.
[02:54:59.478 --> 02:55:02.379]  This free shipping through July 14th.
[02:55:02.379 --> 02:55:08.101]  This has got to be the best deal they've ever offered because shipping is a big part of the cost of food.
[02:55:08.101 --> 02:55:12.602]  Again, he said on multiple orders he'll do this per individual, 800-409-5633 or efoodsdirect.com.
[02:55:17.463 --> 02:55:24.468]  You know, I love the ad that Steve had me cut for this a few days ago when I called him and I said, I think this is serious.
[02:55:24.468 --> 02:55:27.029]  You know, I really like to, you know, warn people to get food.
[02:55:27.029 --> 02:55:29.371]  He was already a sponsor, but I said, we need to really expand this.
[02:55:29.371 --> 02:55:30.712]  And he said, I agree with you.
[02:55:30.712 --> 02:55:33.614]  You know, I said, look, this is about independence.
[02:55:33.614 --> 02:55:35.215]  Fourth of July is coming up.
[02:55:35.215 --> 02:55:38.337]  And Steve said, yes, this is how people declare their independence.
[02:55:38.337 --> 02:55:40.418]  It's a lifestyle change.
[02:55:40.418 --> 02:55:46.903]  You know, it's not just having guns or having a garden or talking to your neighbors or going to your state house and speaking out.
[02:55:46.903 --> 02:55:47.043]  It's
[02:55:48.348 --> 02:55:50.409]  It's that it's all of that together.
[02:55:50.409 --> 02:55:55.771]  It's not being dependent on the system and realizing the government can't and won't take care of you.
[02:55:55.771 --> 02:55:59.813]  And it's a hard thing to make the decision, you know, to face the fact that
[02:56:00.945 --> 02:56:03.407]  America's in deep trouble.
[02:56:03.407 --> 02:56:04.988]  I mean, it's scary.
[02:56:04.988 --> 02:56:07.070]  But around my dinner table, this is all we talk about.
[02:56:07.070 --> 02:56:09.192]  I mean, I believe the things I'm saying.
[02:56:09.192 --> 02:56:17.759]  I was here a decade ago telling you derivatives would be sold to the counties and cities and states to bankrupt us because I'd seen what the same banks had done worldwide.
[02:56:17.759 --> 02:56:19.581]  And now this is happening today.
[02:56:19.581 --> 02:56:21.783]  This isn't a joke, folks.
[02:56:21.783 --> 02:56:28.889]  And the fact that we do have guns and some of us do live on farms, that's one of the few reasons they haven't tried to overthrow us like Cambodia.
[02:56:29.758 --> 02:56:32.321]  But it looks like they're going to go ahead and try it.
[02:56:32.321 --> 02:56:38.086]  And because some of us are self-sufficient, and because patriots are self-sufficient, we've got a chance of beating these people.
[02:56:38.086 --> 02:56:39.968]  Now, we want to keep this peaceful.
[02:56:39.968 --> 02:56:41.910]  But this could turn into a Red Dawn scenario.
[02:56:41.910 --> 02:56:43.952]  I mean, I'm not going to lie to you, folks.
[02:56:43.952 --> 02:56:46.034]  I mean, this government is really evil.
[02:56:46.034 --> 02:56:49.678]  I mean, we've seen the Nazis, we've seen the Soviets.
[02:56:49.678 --> 02:56:50.198]  This is it.
[02:56:51.159 --> 02:56:54.500]  Well Alex, there's just one thought that I'd like to leave you with.
[02:56:54.500 --> 02:56:57.562]  If these potentially controlled areas, if people in these potentially controlled areas,
[02:57:12.037 --> 02:57:18.360]  Like this oil spill area is obviously a potentially and in fact controlled area.
[02:57:18.360 --> 02:57:26.863]  If these folks don't get out under their own power, the option is just like with Katrina, a gathering center.
[02:57:26.863 --> 02:57:30.324]  And a gathering center, this is a FEMA camp my friend.
[02:57:30.324 --> 02:57:39.768]  And so what we're offering is the means, shipping usually runs anywhere between 17 and 20 percent of the cost of the food.
[02:57:40.408 --> 02:57:41.549]  We're absorbing this.
[02:57:41.549 --> 02:57:42.270]  We're taking it.
[02:57:42.270 --> 02:57:43.471]  We're covering it.
[02:57:43.471 --> 02:57:55.141]  In fact, if people will concentrate on realizing what we're saying right now, the facts that you've been trying to tell them, if they don't get out of these potentially controlled areas into safe havens,
[02:57:55.861 --> 02:58:10.452]  Well, that's what's crazy is they went to the high and dry safe areas and made people go to the sports center and then wouldn't let people walk out on the high and dry highways.
[02:58:10.452 --> 02:58:13.194]  You know, the point is the oil may not even come into shore.
[02:58:13.194 --> 02:58:14.935]  It may not even be a crisis.
[02:58:14.935 --> 02:58:22.821]  It probably is going to be, but they could just say evacuate and send in troops to take your guns because they want to dominate us.
[02:58:22.821 --> 02:58:24.142]  They want to set that precedent.
[02:58:24.742 --> 02:58:28.146]  Give eFoodsDirect a call for free shipping for the next 10 days.
[02:58:28.146 --> 02:58:30.408]  eFoodsDirect.com or 800-409-5633.

[02:58:33.070 --> 02:58:33.971]  Take care, Alex.
[02:58:33.971 --> 02:58:35.853]  You bet.
[02:58:35.853 --> 02:58:38.956]  All right, we'll be right back with the final hour.
[02:58:38.956 --> 02:58:40.037]  Your call straight ahead.

[02:59:56.557 --> 02:59:59.318]  Alex Jones on the GCM Radio Network.
[03:00:09.306 --> 03:00:10.306]  Alright, here's the deal.
[03:00:10.306 --> 03:00:12.787]  The toll-free number to join us is 800-259-9231.
[03:00:12.787 --> 03:00:17.347]  I'm going to take calls for the entire first half hour.

[03:00:20.828 --> 03:00:23.929]  If we're going to get to callers, each caller's got to keep it short.
[03:00:23.929 --> 03:00:25.749]  Mike in Louisiana, you're on the air.
[03:00:25.749 --> 03:00:26.349]  Thanks for holding.
[03:00:26.349 --> 03:00:27.469]  Go ahead.
[03:00:27.469 --> 03:00:28.149]  Thank you, Alex.
[03:00:28.149 --> 03:00:33.890]  I want to let you know my next phone call after you will be to eFoods Direct to get some, uh, food.
[03:00:33.890 --> 03:00:37.411]  And, uh, what I've got here is some hard evidence.
[03:00:38.430 --> 03:00:39.010]  I don't know.
[03:00:51.141 --> 03:00:58.905]  Doing nighttime spraying with planes with the lights out over the shoreline, bleaching the beaches.
[03:00:58.905 --> 03:01:01.307]  That is so huge.
[03:01:01.307 --> 03:01:05.229]  And again, everybody keeps telling me to go to the Gulf, and I didn't see a reason why.
[03:01:05.229 --> 03:01:11.272]  Now that they're blocking the First Amendment and doing this, so they're spraying chemicals.
[03:01:11.272 --> 03:01:12.513]  No wonder they don't want people there.
[03:01:12.513 --> 03:01:15.974]  You're saying you've got footage of them doing this at nighttime?
[03:01:15.974 --> 03:01:18.196]  And got samples of the spray.
[03:01:19.076 --> 03:01:21.178]  Well, sir, you need to get that uploaded.
[03:01:21.178 --> 03:01:23.119]  Most talk shows will say, get me that footage.
[03:01:23.119 --> 03:01:23.860]  No, no, no.
[03:01:23.860 --> 03:01:27.703]  You need to get that uploaded to YouTube right now.
[03:01:27.703 --> 03:01:28.624]  I got it.
[03:01:28.624 --> 03:01:29.284]  It's there.
[03:01:29.284 --> 03:01:31.506]  And I got eyewitnesses to it.
[03:01:31.506 --> 03:01:32.447]  When did you shoot this?
[03:01:32.447 --> 03:01:34.068]  When did this happen?
[03:01:34.068 --> 03:01:36.490]  Approximately 10 days ago.
[03:01:36.490 --> 03:01:38.632]  OK, have you put it up on the web yet?
[03:01:38.632 --> 03:01:41.414]  No.
[03:01:41.414 --> 03:01:43.256]  I'm getting it right now.
[03:01:43.256 --> 03:01:44.937]  I don't have the film in my possession.
[03:01:44.937 --> 03:01:45.858]  I've seen it.
[03:01:45.858 --> 03:01:47.159]  I'm going to get it today.
[03:01:47.159 --> 03:01:48.500]  I'm uploading it today.
[03:01:49.019 --> 03:01:49.699]  Unbelievable.
[03:01:49.699 --> 03:01:52.080]  Do you have a YouTube channel?
[03:01:52.080 --> 03:01:52.460]  No, I don't.
[03:01:52.460 --> 03:02:01.104]  Okay, what I'm going to do is I'm going to put you on hold, and the minute you get that... Again, I said I'm going to give each caller a minute, and it's incredible stuff like this.
[03:02:01.104 --> 03:02:03.805]  Mike, where are you in Louisiana, roughly?
[03:02:03.805 --> 03:02:04.845]  I'm right in the city.
[03:02:04.845 --> 03:02:05.945]  I'm right in the city.
[03:02:05.945 --> 03:02:07.266]  So you're in New Orleans?
[03:02:07.266 --> 03:02:08.306]  Mm-hmm.
[03:02:08.306 --> 03:02:14.149]  Okay, and you've seen footage of them nighttime spraying and bleaching the beaches?
[03:02:14.149 --> 03:02:17.610]  I've got evidence of a white witness on film.
[03:02:18.464 --> 03:02:27.065]  Who has witnessed the nighttime spraying and we have samples of the and film of the bleach on the beach.
[03:02:28.326 --> 03:02:29.847]  Uh, where things were bleached.
[03:02:29.847 --> 03:02:36.192]  You can see where if you roll over a boom where it's bleached on one side and it's just ordinary on the other.
[03:02:36.192 --> 03:02:46.460]  Wow, can you imagine, uh, that, and we know they sprayed a million and a half gallons of that, uh, toxic chemical that is eating the boats and is a carcinogen.
[03:02:46.460 --> 03:02:50.543]  The same thing they use in the Exxon Valdez that killed almost everybody involved.
[03:02:51.283 --> 03:02:57.105]  Can you imagine why they're blocking all the media and acting so suspicious?
[03:02:57.105 --> 03:03:00.906]  And can you imagine the health effects of them spraying this on the beach?
[03:03:00.906 --> 03:03:01.767]  I mean, if this is true?
[03:03:01.767 --> 03:03:04.708]  Yeah, but you have no idea what's going on down here.
[03:03:04.708 --> 03:03:09.949]  It's worse than anything I've been hearing reported so far.
[03:03:09.949 --> 03:03:10.490]  Well, tell us.
[03:03:10.490 --> 03:03:11.250]  Tell us what's going on.
[03:03:12.113 --> 03:03:15.134]  Well, it's just hardcore.
[03:03:15.134 --> 03:03:17.875]  Everything is shut down.
[03:03:17.875 --> 03:03:22.417]  I mean, now you can't even go down there with a camera.
[03:03:22.417 --> 03:03:26.519]  Nunzinger has said, well, yes, oh yes, come on down if you want to.
[03:03:26.519 --> 03:03:27.900]  I'll take you there.
[03:03:27.900 --> 03:03:30.481]  That's partially true.
[03:03:30.481 --> 03:03:32.122]  You're going to go through checkpoints.
[03:03:32.122 --> 03:03:33.142]  You're going to get harassed.
[03:03:33.142 --> 03:03:38.864]  And now they will come up and arrest you if you even act like you're going towards the booms.
[03:03:40.956 --> 03:03:42.857]  The evidence I have, though, is real.
[03:03:42.857 --> 03:03:47.100]  There's one other thing I just want to shamelessly promote.
[03:03:47.100 --> 03:03:53.024]  I am probably the only conspiracy nut cartoonist.
[03:03:53.024 --> 03:03:53.985]  I'm published.
[03:03:53.985 --> 03:03:57.608]  I'm reaching 50,000 people in a local publication here.
[03:03:57.608 --> 03:04:02.091]  And I get a lot of my material from your show.
[03:04:02.091 --> 03:04:03.952]  And I'm reaching a lot of people.
[03:04:03.952 --> 03:04:04.352]  That's awesome.
[03:04:04.352 --> 03:04:05.593]  You've told us about it before.
[03:04:05.593 --> 03:04:06.514]  What, it's a weekly favor?
[03:04:07.268 --> 03:04:10.330]  It's a monthly, it's a New Orleans levy.
[03:04:10.330 --> 03:04:12.352]  We don't hold anything back, is our motto.
[03:04:12.352 --> 03:04:13.072]  That's for you today, sir.
[03:04:32.867 --> 03:04:33.627]  All right, thank you.
[03:04:33.627 --> 03:04:34.588]  Well, I want to see that.
[03:04:34.588 --> 03:04:36.349]  We'll put him on hold and get his info, guys.
[03:04:36.349 --> 03:04:41.791]  I'm going to go to Tim, Joe, John, Bobby, and others.
[03:04:41.791 --> 03:04:49.976]  I tell you, I mean, I guess I can go down there and get arrested, but everybody... I mean, they're on CNN saying you're not allowed to videotape the dead dolphins or anything, or they'll arrest you.
[03:04:49.976 --> 03:04:54.358]  Since when was the power of the press dead in America?
[03:04:54.358 --> 03:05:00.741]  And we've got this illegal alien, Barry Sitaro, up there, just getting away with murder and blocking the relief effort.
[03:05:01.081 --> 03:05:01.842]  Listen up, folks.
[03:05:01.842 --> 03:05:02.783]  This is important.
[03:05:02.783 --> 03:05:03.884]  Alex Jones here.

[03:07:00.370 --> 03:07:04.913]  This is Alex Jones with 5 good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[03:07:04.913 --> 03:07:05.833]  Number 1.
[03:07:05.833 --> 03:07:09.256]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[03:07:09.256 --> 03:07:10.116]  Number 2.
[03:07:10.116 --> 03:07:14.999]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[03:07:14.999 --> 03:07:15.760]  It's true.
[03:07:15.760 --> 03:07:20.623]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[03:07:20.623 --> 03:07:21.443]  Number 3.
[03:07:21.443 --> 03:07:25.026]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[03:07:25.026 --> 03:07:28.728]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[03:07:28.928 --> 03:07:29.729]  Number 4.
[03:07:29.729 --> 03:07:32.492]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[03:07:32.492 --> 03:07:36.176]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[03:07:36.176 --> 03:07:36.957]  Number 5.
[03:07:36.957 --> 03:07:41.122]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[03:07:41.122 --> 03:07:45.887]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[03:07:46.167 --> 03:07:50.328]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[03:07:50.328 --> 03:07:52.108]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[03:07:52.108 --> 03:07:54.349]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun.
[03:07:54.349 --> 03:07:56.869]  So go to mysolarbackup.com or call 1-877-327-0365.
[03:07:56.869 --> 03:07:58.069]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[03:07:58.069 --> 03:07:59.230]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[03:08:12.814 --> 03:08:19.136]  We are experiencing the greatest acceleration of technological development in human history.
[03:08:19.136 --> 03:08:22.358]  And there's good things happening as a result of that, but there's also a lot of bad.
[03:08:22.358 --> 03:08:30.421]  And we have a very corrupt, predatory elite who admittedly is using scientific forms of control to manipulate humanity.
[03:08:31.061 --> 03:08:41.247]  And the general public has been sucked into a malaise of sports and Hollywood garbage, distracting them from the real things that are happening in the world.
[03:08:41.247 --> 03:08:46.289]  This radio broadcast is here to get the public to think about real issues.
[03:08:46.289 --> 03:08:48.190]  We've got wide open phones right now.
[03:08:48.190 --> 03:08:54.614]  I'm going to news blitz and go over a lot of key information coming up at the bottom of the hour, like the lights are going out.
[03:08:55.174 --> 03:08:55.734]  Hey Alex!
[03:08:55.734 --> 03:09:00.275]  First I'd like to say happy belated Independence Day to one of the most prominent, truthful patriots that I know.
[03:09:25.081 --> 03:09:28.262]  I really appreciate everything that you shared with me.
[03:09:28.262 --> 03:09:36.485]  I have one speaking point and also an article I'd like to share with you.
[03:09:36.485 --> 03:09:37.985]  Let me get it all out here.
[03:09:37.985 --> 03:09:44.067]  Me and my girlfriend wanted to make the fourth kind of a special thing so we chose to
[03:09:45.117 --> 03:09:49.620]  Take some action in being advocates.
[03:09:49.620 --> 03:09:56.204]  So we went out, I actually made a t-shirt that resembles the American flag.
[03:09:56.204 --> 03:10:03.769]  It simply says that Uncle Sam wants you to believe the insane idea that if you give up all your rights and freedoms, they can't protect you.
[03:10:03.769 --> 03:10:07.111]  Your rights and your freedom are your only protection.
[03:10:07.111 --> 03:10:09.952]  We each were wearing one of those t-shirts.
[03:10:09.952 --> 03:10:13.935]  Then I made up a little flyer that just says we're curious about how many people
[03:10:14.773 --> 03:10:25.517]  And again, that's not going to save the world in and of itself, but your act of resistance and your act of caring, that will awaken the sleeping giant that is America.
[03:10:25.517 --> 03:10:25.838]  Continue.
[03:10:41.912 --> 03:10:43.833]  I want to tell you something, Alex.
[03:10:43.833 --> 03:10:48.975]  You would not believe how positive the response was.
[03:10:48.975 --> 03:10:51.416]  A lot of people are awake, Alex.
[03:10:51.416 --> 03:10:52.636]  This is working.
[03:10:52.636 --> 03:10:53.636]  You would not believe.
[03:10:53.636 --> 03:10:55.777]  I couldn't call it anything less than remarkable.
[03:10:55.777 --> 03:11:00.599]  People were thanking us for being out there handing out the Bill of Rights.
[03:11:00.599 --> 03:11:08.642]  I printed, I printed in triplicate 30 of your movies and was passing them out with a copy of the Bill of Rights.
[03:11:09.529 --> 03:11:21.517]  And the little pamphlet that we had also says that we feel that, being it 4th of July, that we think it's our civic duty to pass out the Bill of Rights in a related video.
[03:11:21.517 --> 03:11:23.078]  That's what the 4th is about!
[03:11:23.078 --> 03:11:32.724]  It's not about hamburgers and beer, as much fun as that is, and I did that, and it's not about fireworks and going out to the lake or whatever.
[03:11:33.764 --> 03:11:37.186]  We're celebrating our liberties, but we're losing our liberties.
[03:11:37.186 --> 03:11:39.788]  The Fourth is about that Bill of Rights.
[03:11:39.788 --> 03:11:41.489]  It is about that Constitution.
[03:11:41.489 --> 03:11:50.694]  And look, it's not perfect, but it's under attack by the globalists because it is like holy water to a vampire, and that's why they want to eradicate it.
[03:11:50.694 --> 03:11:52.475]  Tim, I said I gotta move quick.
[03:11:52.475 --> 03:11:53.796]  Real fast.
[03:11:53.796 --> 03:11:55.317]  Okay.
[03:11:55.317 --> 03:12:02.601]  We brought our video equipment with us, and we really only got one person that would really allow us to videotape them.
[03:12:03.274 --> 03:12:10.759]  Accepting the Bill of Rights and the video, and somehow my video got screwed up.
[03:12:10.759 --> 03:12:12.220]  Anyway... Well, you should have just videoed it.
[03:12:12.220 --> 03:12:12.980]  Tim, I gotta jump.
[03:12:12.980 --> 03:12:13.460]  Good job.
[03:12:13.460 --> 03:12:14.521]  I appreciate it.
[03:12:14.521 --> 03:12:15.742]  I mean, look, it's a public place.
[03:12:15.742 --> 03:12:18.603]  There's no perception of privacy.
[03:12:18.603 --> 03:12:20.925]  The key is, walk around and just do what you want.
[03:12:21.818 --> 03:12:25.541]  Okay, and then if somebody has a problem, just say, yeah, don't worry, pal, home movie.
[03:12:25.541 --> 03:12:28.764]  Okay, but good job, Tim, keep it up, very exciting.
[03:12:28.764 --> 03:12:42.836]  And there are millions of Tims out there making copies of The Obama Deception, Fall of the Republic, Truth Rising, Camp FEMA, The Money Man, you know, all the, not just my films, other films, getting them out to people.
[03:12:42.836 --> 03:12:43.757]  It's so exciting.
[03:12:43.757 --> 03:12:45.579]  Joe in Chicago, Joe, you're on the air.
[03:12:46.434 --> 03:12:47.796]  Yes, Alex.
[03:12:47.796 --> 03:12:56.685]  From last Thursday, there was a public communique issued by the Foreign and Colonial Office, Charles Street, London.
[03:12:56.685 --> 03:13:00.529]  It had to do with Great Britain expanding its influence in the world.
[03:13:00.529 --> 03:13:02.812]  It was given by the Secretary of State, William Hague.
[03:13:03.263 --> 03:13:04.784]  Let me stop you for just a minute.
[03:13:04.784 --> 03:13:07.244]  Specifically, what are you talking about?
[03:13:07.244 --> 03:13:08.105]  Who did what?
[03:13:33.082 --> 03:13:37.345]  The British Secretary of State, William Hague.
[03:13:37.345 --> 03:13:39.766]  Yeah, he was saying he was at a meeting where?
[03:13:39.766 --> 03:13:45.190]  No, he issued a public declaration of imperialism.
[03:13:45.190 --> 03:13:47.231]  How they're going to re-imperialize.
[03:13:47.231 --> 03:13:52.734]  This was in the Financial Times Deutschland.
[03:13:52.734 --> 03:13:54.776]  The German Financial Times?
[03:13:54.776 --> 03:13:54.976]  Yes.
[03:13:55.914 --> 03:13:57.175]  Okay, well send me the article.
[03:13:57.175 --> 03:14:00.098]  Send it to showtipsandinfowars.com.
[03:14:00.098 --> 03:14:04.703]  I mean, it is the British Empire model that's running the globe.
[03:14:04.703 --> 03:14:06.585]  Not the British people themselves.
[03:14:06.585 --> 03:14:10.849]  They've just paid for it, and so that's interesting information.
[03:14:10.849 --> 03:14:12.971]  John in Ohio, thanks for holding her on the air.
[03:14:13.772 --> 03:14:26.040]  Yeah, before I get to my point about how the United States and Israel are trying to provoke an attack against Iran, a country that has zero nuclear weapons, by these two countries that have thousands.
[03:14:26.040 --> 03:14:29.001]  Now wait a minute, they said Saddam had them, it must be true.
[03:14:29.001 --> 03:14:42.450]  Yeah, that's the kind of lies that you'll fool me once, fool me twice, you can fool me a hundred times, I guess, with some people in this country, with the same lies, exact same lies, but before I get to that... Well, it's fun to be scared of brown people.
[03:14:43.735 --> 03:15:05.311]  Well, okay, I'll get straight to that, because I think that the real key here is Israel and the whitewash and the influence that Israel has within the media, within the government, the Senate, the Congress, through both Republican and Democratic administrations, dual citizens, agents of Israel like Rahm Emanuel, Richard Perle, Wolfowitz, and the Bush administration.
[03:15:05.971 --> 03:15:12.559]  You have, I think, the military-industrial complex of the United States, which is the vicious dog.
[03:15:12.559 --> 03:15:15.362]  And then you've got Israel, which is the rabid dog.
[03:15:15.362 --> 03:15:19.587]  And I think that rabid dog has gained so much ability to infect our own
[03:15:20.183 --> 03:15:24.165]  Already inclined to war mongers within the military-industrial complex.
[03:15:24.165 --> 03:15:25.246]  That is really dangerous.
[03:15:25.246 --> 03:15:28.447]  And I think that the whitewashing... Well, have you ever seen dogs?
[03:15:28.447 --> 03:15:29.468]  Or like coyotes?
[03:15:29.468 --> 03:15:31.829]  I've been deer hunting before and watched coyotes.
[03:15:31.829 --> 03:15:35.891]  When they're hunting, they'll yip and yap at each other and jump around and get each other excited.
[03:15:35.891 --> 03:15:38.332]  And it's kind of like you can tell your dog, wanna go for a walk?
[03:15:38.332 --> 03:15:39.032]  Wanna go for a walk?
[03:15:39.032 --> 03:15:40.673]  Alright, get him, get him!
[03:15:40.673 --> 03:15:42.654]  And yes, they're like exciting each other.
[03:15:42.654 --> 03:15:44.355]  It's a radicalization process.
[03:15:44.355 --> 03:15:48.617]  Yes, and I believe that whitewashing is real at this time.
[03:15:49.364 --> 03:16:15.599]  And I have a bone to pick with you here because of Kegel's patting on the wrist for a murderous massacre on the high seas, as I feel you did, and bringing on immediately afterwards, after Michael Rivero, this voice in the wilderness amongst this polluted tsunami of pro-Israeli whitewash of this massacre of these aid workers, that you thought you had to go out and get a Zionist apologist
[03:16:16.044 --> 03:16:27.846]  The very next day and that you had to give credibility to this one video that you never give any credibility to others where you know they're forging and they're editing and they're spicing which is exactly what happened with that Israeli video.
[03:16:28.419 --> 03:16:41.606]  And I also feel that your whitewash of Rand Paul, who is an obsequious brown-noser of Israel at this very dangerous time, calling for all of these sanctions against Iran... Hey, listen, listen, listen.
[03:16:41.606 --> 03:16:52.732]  John, the reason you were able to get on is because we don't censor calls A, and B, I've told callers they can have one minute and everybody's getting about two or three, and that's why a bunch of callers aren't going to get on today.
[03:16:52.732 --> 03:16:53.213]  So it's a catch-22.
[03:16:54.213 --> 03:16:54.513]  I've got
[03:17:11.238 --> 03:17:11.538]  Agent
[03:17:33.447 --> 03:17:45.510]  To blame everything on Israel and to demonize Israel all day and to just literally say that if you've got mold on your bread, when you open up your cupboard, Israel did it.
[03:17:45.510 --> 03:17:50.812]  Like a little guy with a yarmulke on at night, like a gremlin, came out and peed on your bread or something.
[03:17:50.812 --> 03:17:54.233]  I'm sorry to use that analogy, but I'm just sick of it.
[03:17:54.953 --> 03:18:03.436]  I have seen the Israel bashing crowd, if they're trying to win friends and influence enemies, they're not very good at it.
[03:18:03.436 --> 03:18:10.699]  Because they lie, they exaggerate, they twist about me.
[03:18:10.699 --> 03:18:11.440]  Okay?
[03:18:11.440 --> 03:18:14.001]  Quite frankly, I don't like what Israel's doing.
[03:18:14.001 --> 03:18:17.662]  Quite frankly, I don't like the Israeli lobby manipulating our policies.
[03:18:17.662 --> 03:18:20.803]  I don't like foreign aid to Israel or anybody else for that matter.
[03:18:20.803 --> 03:18:22.404]  I don't want to have war with Iran.
[03:18:23.570 --> 03:18:25.432]  Okay, I'm critical of the wars.
[03:18:25.432 --> 03:18:28.014]  I've been critical before they started.
[03:18:28.014 --> 03:18:32.998]  I'm not like the Republican leadership now, just now becoming anti-war because it's popular.
[03:18:32.998 --> 03:18:35.781]  So, I mean, it's not enough that I'm anti-war.
[03:18:35.781 --> 03:18:37.963]  It's not enough that I'm against attacking Iran.
[03:18:37.963 --> 03:18:42.607]  I mean, you know, I've got to be Bobby Fischer or whatever and start wearing a Nazi armband.
[03:18:42.607 --> 03:18:43.468]  I'm not going to do it.
[03:18:44.412 --> 03:18:56.875]  Okay, I know that all governments are corrupt and out of control, some more than others, and I blame corrupt governments and global mafias, not individuals.
[03:18:56.875 --> 03:19:02.796]  And so, you know, no one's going to bully me into making my whole show about bashing Israel.
[03:19:02.796 --> 03:19:08.877]  I could care less if a bunch of federally financed Nazis and people keeps coming out there, a bunch of feds attack me.
[03:19:08.877 --> 03:19:12.418]  They want to radicalize the patriot movement so it doesn't have a big tent.
[03:19:12.998 --> 03:19:17.243]  So that when you talk about anti-globalism, it's like anti-black or anti-Jew.
[03:19:17.243 --> 03:19:18.724]  I'm not going to do that.
[03:19:18.724 --> 03:19:19.025]  Okay?
[03:19:19.025 --> 03:19:24.591]  I want everybody to make the decision for themselves whether they're for liberty or whether they're for tyranny.
[03:19:24.591 --> 03:19:30.737]  And so I don't care how much stuff the anti-Israel crowd makes up about me.
[03:19:30.737 --> 03:19:34.641]  I'm going to continue to criticize Israel when they do things that are wrong.
[03:19:35.282 --> 03:19:39.786]  And I'm going to continue to criticize Saudi Arabia when they do things that are wrong, or England, or anybody else.
[03:19:39.786 --> 03:19:45.271]  I mean, a year ago I reported Israel was killing Palestinians and taking their organs.
[03:19:45.271 --> 03:19:47.273]  And now Israel's had to admit that's the case.
[03:19:47.273 --> 03:19:49.815]  I got attacked when I did it because I knew it was true.
[03:19:49.815 --> 03:19:54.459]  But then I go on and add other governments are killing people, taking their organs, including the U.S.
[03:19:54.459 --> 03:19:55.240]  government.
[03:19:55.240 --> 03:19:59.484]  And then that Jew haters don't like that because only Jews can steal organs.
[03:19:59.484 --> 03:20:00.745]  Only Jews, they say.
[03:20:00.745 --> 03:20:01.566]  We'll be right back.
[03:20:03.864 --> 03:20:06.046]  You're subject to public police action.
[03:20:06.046 --> 03:20:07.307]  Tyranny is here.
[03:20:07.307 --> 03:20:11.250]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[03:20:11.250 --> 03:20:13.492]  It really says that the state is God.
[03:20:13.492 --> 03:20:18.536]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on Earth.
[03:20:19.335 --> 03:20:26.005]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps, now being expanded nationwide.
[03:20:26.005 --> 03:20:32.013]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful shadow state.
[03:20:32.013 --> 03:20:35.679]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depth to which our Republic has fallen.
[03:20:36.159 --> 03:20:40.441]  Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship.
[03:20:40.441 --> 03:20:46.404]  Body scanners, sound cameras, citizen spies, stage terror and cameras on every street corner.
[03:20:46.404 --> 03:20:49.945]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[03:20:49.945 --> 03:20:51.926]  The police state isn't coming.
[03:20:51.926 --> 03:20:53.047]  It's here.

[03:21:00.990 --> 03:21:03.951]  Making the right decisions is a challenge to investors.
[03:21:03.951 --> 03:21:08.093]  Are we going to see economic growth slide into a recession or at worst depression?
[03:21:08.093 --> 03:21:10.354]  Hi, Ted Anderson from Midas Resources.
[03:21:10.354 --> 03:21:15.536]  We all know when a company acts irresponsibly, divesting ourselves in a move towards safety is prudent.
[03:21:15.536 --> 03:21:17.337]  When the market becomes volatile, U.S.
[03:21:17.337 --> 03:21:18.898]  Treasuries are a safe haven.
[03:21:18.898 --> 03:21:20.379]  But what do you do when the U.S.
[03:21:20.379 --> 03:21:23.420]  government overextends itself and spends beyond its means?
[03:21:23.740 --> 03:21:29.121]  Many investors are turning toward gold as a common-sense alternative to traditional paper investments.
[03:21:29.121 --> 03:21:38.444]  Midas Resources has put together a powerful book titled 10 Reasons to Own Gold, discussing costs, benefits, risks, featuring full-color illustrations, weights, and measures.
[03:21:38.444 --> 03:21:40.804]  The book is free and can be yours by calling 800-686-2237.
[03:21:40.804 --> 03:21:42.505]  Paper investments are dwarfed by gold's 6,000-year history.
[03:21:47.106 --> 03:21:47.607]  Don't answer it!
[03:22:02.876 --> 03:22:10.982]  If fear strikes your heart when the phone rings, knowing it may be another bill collector, it's time for you to call Zero Debt in 90 Days.
[03:22:10.982 --> 03:22:12.463]  800-477-9256.
[03:22:12.463 --> 03:22:18.807]  Settlements, bankruptcy, and attorneys are not the answer, and may end up costing you up to 10 times more than necessary.
[03:22:18.807 --> 03:22:23.090]  Listen, if you're already in debt, does it make sense to get buried in another payment plan?
[03:22:23.090 --> 03:22:28.054]  Zero Debt in 90 Days gets you out of debt in 90 days, guaranteed, without a payment plan.
[03:22:28.334 --> 03:22:28.734]  I think so.
[03:22:53.439 --> 03:22:53.519]  800-477-9256.
[03:22:53.519 --> 03:22:53.700]  That's 800-477-9256.
[03:22:59.966 --> 03:23:00.726]  Listen up, folks.
[03:23:00.726 --> 03:23:01.666]  This is important.
[03:23:01.666 --> 03:23:02.787]  Alex Jones here.

[03:24:05.340 --> 03:24:11.824]  You know, I don't want to digress because I want to go to your phone calls, Bobby, John and Matt.
[03:24:11.824 --> 03:24:14.205]  We'll at least get to those before I get into the news and the video clubs.
[03:24:16.038 --> 03:24:24.390]  But time is running out here, but we have articles today on InfoWars.com that we wrote critical of what Israel's doing.
[03:24:24.390 --> 03:24:25.352]  Here's one.
[03:24:25.352 --> 03:24:29.658]  Israel suspected in bogus claim Iran developing nuclear trigger.
[03:24:30.683 --> 03:24:37.185]  And the Sunday Times is out putting this info out and Israel's been caught before putting out exaggerated and dubious claims.
[03:24:37.185 --> 03:24:38.305]  There we are.
[03:24:38.305 --> 03:24:40.066]  Every day.
[03:24:40.066 --> 03:24:46.308]  I mean, I've got people that work for me paid to, you know, go out and research things and come out with the truth.
[03:24:46.308 --> 03:24:47.988]  Just like our government.
[03:24:47.988 --> 03:24:51.709]  But at the same time, I'm not here saying, see, see, I'm good.
[03:24:51.709 --> 03:24:52.729]  I'm bashing Israel.
[03:24:52.729 --> 03:24:54.170]  I don't care what you think of me.
[03:24:56.516 --> 03:25:03.320]  I mean, I'm sick of the peer pressure to worship Israel, and I'm equally as sick of the peer pressure to attack Israel.
[03:25:03.320 --> 03:25:08.283]  I look at the facts, and I report what it is.
[03:25:08.283 --> 03:25:08.584]  Okay?
[03:25:08.584 --> 03:25:10.425]  And I try to look at both sides.
[03:25:10.425 --> 03:25:15.128]  I mean, I get emails saying, you've had all these guests on with different views on the oil spill.
[03:25:15.128 --> 03:25:17.729]  That's what I do!
[03:25:17.729 --> 03:25:22.232]  I had a bunch of different guests on with different perspective on the whole flu thing.
[03:25:22.232 --> 03:25:23.673]  I mean, I don't have all the answers.
[03:25:23.673 --> 03:25:24.794]  I'm trying to figure this out.
[03:25:26.262 --> 03:25:28.813]  It's just, I want it said that...
[03:25:31.172 --> 03:25:40.797]  I cover what I want to cover, and it doesn't bother me when people lie about me and, you know, make stuff up and sit there and, like, I'm even more anti-Jew than you are.
[03:25:40.797 --> 03:25:43.938]  You know, I think Jews should all be killed, you know.
[03:25:43.938 --> 03:25:46.379]  Some people say, and they're like, that's not enough, you know.
[03:25:46.379 --> 03:25:48.780]  I watch these Nazi groups and anti-Israel groups.
[03:25:48.780 --> 03:25:50.841]  I mean, they're just a bunch of scum.
[03:25:50.841 --> 03:25:55.824]  They all fight with each other and lie, and just because you make something up doesn't mean it's true.
[03:25:55.824 --> 03:25:58.705]  And most of you are led by FBI agents like Hal Turner.
[03:25:58.945 --> 03:26:02.446]  Who I told you 10 years ago was an FBI agent, and it turned out he was.
[03:26:02.446 --> 03:26:04.126]  Because I could tell he was.
[03:26:04.126 --> 03:26:05.807]  They want to radicalize everybody.
[03:26:05.807 --> 03:26:08.347]  They want to have people bashing Israel.
[03:26:08.347 --> 03:26:12.768]  And then Israel gets to control its people more when they get persecuted.
[03:26:12.768 --> 03:26:15.209]  How do you think this works?
[03:26:15.209 --> 03:26:19.890]  That's why the media comes out and says, men and men are killing illegal aliens and want them all dead.
[03:26:19.890 --> 03:26:24.051]  It's not true, but then that makes the illegal aliens team up with the government more.
[03:26:25.458 --> 03:26:28.082]  I mean, I understand how this stuff works, folks.
[03:26:28.082 --> 03:26:29.525]  I'm pretty smart.
[03:26:29.525 --> 03:26:33.351]  And I'm surprised other people aren't smart and can't see how it's working.
[03:26:33.351 --> 03:26:38.520]  I want to be able to criticize Israel when it's doing something wrong from a credible standpoint.
[03:26:40.003 --> 03:26:58.138]  Not, I see these Nazi sites with people dressed up in weird Jewish outfits making fun of them or they'll photoshop my head onto a fat guy's body next to a fat woman at a Jewish wedding and say it's me and have all these big articles, how it's the proof, and I mean, it's a joke!
[03:26:58.138 --> 03:26:59.238]  It's a joke!
[03:26:59.238 --> 03:27:01.801]  These are discredited, pathetic people!
[03:27:02.862 --> 03:27:05.804]  And so many weak-minded idiots get caught by that.
[03:27:32.722 --> 03:27:35.166]  Big shot.
[03:27:35.166 --> 03:27:41.938]  I am the biggest guy in the fight against the New World Order, except for Ron Paul, but I'm a lot more hardcore because I can be.
[03:27:41.938 --> 03:27:42.859]  I'm not a congressman.
[03:27:44.588 --> 03:28:02.240]  Because I tell it like it is, I've got a real track record, our predictions have almost all come true, we've looked at history, we've done hard work, I've made 25 plus films, I've produced three other films, I've written a book, published another book, we bust our butt, we get a lot of work done, and it's good!
[03:28:02.240 --> 03:28:08.765]  I'm here saying they're putting cameras up with microphones listening to you and running it through NSA keyword software.
[03:28:09.085 --> 03:28:10.486]  That's now mainstream news.
[03:28:10.486 --> 03:28:14.708]  I was reading federal funding packages 11 years ago about it.
[03:28:14.708 --> 03:28:17.589]  I was reading federal grants about it.
[03:28:17.589 --> 03:28:21.651]  I told you 15 years ago they're taking your baby's blood at birth for a bioweapons lab.
[03:28:21.651 --> 03:28:23.212]  Now it's admitted.
[03:28:23.212 --> 03:28:26.314]  I told you they're designing GMO crops to sterilize you.
[03:28:26.314 --> 03:28:27.454]  Now it's mainstream news.
[03:28:27.454 --> 03:28:33.517]  I've got a Fox News report here admitting that the chemicals in plastics are sterilizing men.
[03:28:33.517 --> 03:28:34.498]  And it's by design.
[03:28:35.831 --> 03:28:42.796]  You know, I got a CNN report admitting they, in Chicken McNuggets, they put a plastic in it, which just so happens to reduce fertility.
[03:28:42.796 --> 03:28:44.877]  I mean, you know what?
[03:28:44.877 --> 03:28:46.318]  Let's say I am the devil.
[03:28:46.318 --> 03:28:50.702]  Let's say I'm the worst guy in the world, which I'm not, but all of us are fallen creatures.
[03:28:50.702 --> 03:28:53.404]  What are you gonna do about poisoning your food and water?
[03:28:53.404 --> 03:28:55.965]  What are you gonna do about World War III that I'm opposing?
[03:28:55.965 --> 03:28:59.588]  What are you gonna do about that oil coming in towards shore with these hurricanes?
[03:28:59.588 --> 03:29:03.571]  No, you're gonna sit there and Photoshop my head on a fat man.
[03:29:03.891 --> 03:29:04.652]  Good!
[03:29:04.652 --> 03:29:05.592]  Knock yourself out!
[03:29:05.592 --> 03:29:06.293]  You're a loser!
[03:29:06.293 --> 03:29:07.313]  You're a failure!
[03:29:07.313 --> 03:29:08.474]  You're a joke!
[03:29:08.474 --> 03:29:09.895]  You don't like a real man!
[03:29:09.895 --> 03:29:11.836]  You don't like somebody who uses their real name!
[03:29:11.836 --> 03:29:13.698]  You don't like somebody who's out in the open!
[03:29:13.698 --> 03:29:18.721]  You don't like somebody who doesn't hate black people and doesn't hate Mexicans and doesn't hate Jews!
[03:29:18.721 --> 03:29:30.969]  Now I'll say this, when you got racist Jewish groups and Mexican groups and black groups that don't like Whitey, I stand up and say they're a bunch of racist trash as well, being manipulated by the globalists who play all these groups off against each other!
[03:29:30.969 --> 03:29:31.730]  So get it straight!
[03:29:33.123 --> 03:29:34.504]  Okay, you want to be the big man?
[03:29:34.504 --> 03:29:36.926]  You think it's easy to take shots at Alex Jones?
[03:29:36.926 --> 03:29:50.696]  I love it because I am successful in great part because of all your lies and your propaganda because you have sent all the hundreds of thousands of you out there that attack me have sent people to me and they find out who I really am.
[03:29:50.696 --> 03:29:51.877]  Thank you.
[03:29:51.877 --> 03:29:53.278]  We're on the march.
[03:29:53.278 --> 03:29:54.879]  The Empire's on the run.
[03:29:54.879 --> 03:29:58.502]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[03:30:01.237 --> 03:30:02.879]  Hello friends, this is Alex Jones.

[03:31:00.885 --> 03:31:03.266]  They helped to create a New World Order.
[03:31:03.266 --> 03:31:05.587]  We are part of a New World Order.
[03:31:05.587 --> 03:31:08.808]  A New World Order based upon collective action.
[03:31:08.808 --> 03:31:13.889]  Invisible Empire is a damning indictment of the globalists through their own words and documents.
[03:31:13.889 --> 03:31:18.091]  The New World Order really is a tool for addressing a new world of possibilities.
[03:31:18.411 --> 03:31:20.873]  It means all the world under their control.
[03:31:20.873 --> 03:31:23.294]  The United Nations would take over America.
[03:31:23.294 --> 03:31:26.556]  The Trilateral Commission would control the world.
[03:31:26.556 --> 03:31:34.161]  Invisible Empire chronicles how men of power and influence have worked in stealth for centuries to establish an oppressive world government.
[03:31:34.488 --> 03:31:39.870]  I believe first of all that we now need nothing short of a world constitution for the global financial system.
[03:31:39.870 --> 03:31:42.730]  Global governance with the establishment of the G20.
[03:31:42.730 --> 03:31:46.411]  So it's going to be an inner ruling elite and then everyone else.
[03:31:46.411 --> 03:31:47.492]  And I got news for you.
[03:31:47.492 --> 03:31:48.832]  You're everyone else.
[03:31:48.832 --> 03:31:50.312]  Invisible Empire.

[03:33:39.987 --> 03:33:41.568]  Thank you for joining us.
[03:33:41.568 --> 03:33:45.089]  Let's try to run through some of the phone calls quickly here now.
[03:33:45.089 --> 03:33:47.490]  Let's talk to Bobby Lee in Texas quickly.
[03:33:47.490 --> 03:33:49.131]  Bobby Lee, go ahead.
[03:33:49.131 --> 03:33:50.232]  Hi, Alex.
[03:33:50.232 --> 03:33:57.095]  You know, the state of Arizona, they could put an end to the persecution, threats, and intimidation by the Obama administration.
[03:33:58.150 --> 03:34:02.773]  That lady over there, she's got more cojones than 80% of the men in this country.
[03:34:02.773 --> 03:34:13.878]  All she has to do is get her representatives from her state and the adjoining border states to file impeachment charges against Obama for treason.
[03:34:13.878 --> 03:34:19.521]  And those people who don't want to go along with it, you have a perfect example of who you want to kick out.
[03:34:20.143 --> 03:34:21.344]  And throw out of office.
[03:34:21.344 --> 03:34:25.505]  Because it would not only bring to light to the rest of the people of the country.
[03:34:25.505 --> 03:34:26.786]  I speak to a lot of people.
[03:34:26.786 --> 03:34:29.467]  I tell them what's going on on the border.
[03:34:29.467 --> 03:34:30.747]  And they don't believe it.
[03:34:30.747 --> 03:34:32.508]  The news media has blacked it all out.
[03:34:32.508 --> 03:34:35.769]  This would bring it all out in the open, you know.
[03:34:35.769 --> 03:34:45.653]  And it would also give an indication of those particular representatives who don't give a dang about our country and want to see it go down in tubes.
[03:34:45.653 --> 03:34:47.394]  And you get rid of all of them.
[03:34:50.100 --> 03:34:50.981]  No, it's a good point.
[03:34:50.981 --> 03:35:03.451]  In fact, I'm going to shoot a YouTube video today as an emergency release just dealing with the treason issue of his impending executive order and his lawsuit to try to block Arizona from protecting itself.
[03:35:03.451 --> 03:35:10.237]  I mean, Arizona, 80 to 100 miles in, a third of the state, many areas are now off limits to the citizens.
[03:35:10.237 --> 03:35:12.518]  I mean, Mexico is a failed state.
[03:35:12.518 --> 03:35:13.479]  This isn't a game.
[03:35:13.479 --> 03:35:17.262]  I mean, for all these trendies and fake liberals and people out there,
[03:35:18.263 --> 03:35:20.144]  Mexico controls its borders.
[03:35:20.144 --> 03:35:21.844]  Every other nation does.
[03:35:21.844 --> 03:35:32.128]  Especially when you're bordering a collapsing third world country that's very nationalistic and very anti-America because it's lost wars with this country.
[03:35:32.128 --> 03:35:32.528]  Okay?
[03:35:32.528 --> 03:35:33.668]  I mean, that's just a fact.
[03:35:33.668 --> 03:35:36.189]  The facts are the facts.
[03:35:36.189 --> 03:35:37.570]  And we've got to defend ourselves.
[03:35:38.470 --> 03:35:47.146]  But we've got this treacherous federal government that's globalist and it wants global government and it wants to bankrupt the country because then we collapse under federal control.
[03:35:47.146 --> 03:35:47.927]  It is treason!
[03:35:49.565 --> 03:36:03.288]  Most of the people have no idea that the Mexican military is running interference for the drug lords as far as 10, 20 miles up inside with also not only the armored personnel carriers, but the helicopters and everything else.
[03:36:03.288 --> 03:36:10.550]  And Bobby, that's all over Texas news, it's all over Arizona news, but it's not national news.
[03:36:11.730 --> 03:36:13.571]  It is insane.
[03:36:13.571 --> 03:36:22.935]  They have troops coming miles and miles over the border on major highways and actually robbing police at gunpoint and telling them, you don't come on this road or you're dead.
[03:36:22.935 --> 03:36:33.239]  We are giving up parts of our states to Mexico and the globalists and the traitors in Washington love it because they want to bring down America as much as they want to bring down Iran.
[03:36:33.239 --> 03:36:36.440]  Any country that's been sovereign must be destroyed.
[03:36:36.440 --> 03:36:37.301]  I appreciate your call.
[03:36:38.106 --> 03:36:39.367]  It's unbelievable.
[03:36:39.367 --> 03:36:43.528]  Let's go ahead and talk to, let me see, John in Washington.
[03:36:43.528 --> 03:36:45.049]  You're on the air, John.
[03:36:45.049 --> 03:36:49.851]  Hi Alex, I just wanted to let you know I spoke with some friends of mine down on the Gulf Coast.
[03:36:49.851 --> 03:36:54.953]  I ran a fish camp down there in Grand Bay for some time and had a crabbing business.
[03:36:54.953 --> 03:36:58.495]  I met a lot of people in the industry and we're still in touch.
[03:36:58.495 --> 03:37:03.117]  I just spoke with actually two different ones, one from Grand Bay.
[03:37:03.117 --> 03:37:03.917]  They were down south and west
[03:37:06.118 --> 03:37:07.559]  of where the oil leak is.
[03:37:07.559 --> 03:37:26.248]  They said that there are huge mats of floating, rotting fish down there and that occasionally bursts of bubbles, foamy bubbles, will come to the surface and that the gas odor is so heavy and so strong they're afraid that it's going to cause their boat to ignite.
[03:37:26.248 --> 03:37:30.070]  And they finally got into the slip, into the bay, to come home.
[03:37:33.684 --> 03:37:37.407]  And, uh, the, there were, there were, uh, personnel there.
[03:37:37.407 --> 03:37:46.173]  They didn't say if they were, uh, National Guard or, or whatever, or Coast Guard, but they said that they took his thousand dollar camera.
[03:37:46.173 --> 03:37:49.015]  He had a bunch of pictures for me and they took his camera from him.
[03:37:51.802 --> 03:37:58.669]  Well, that's on record that they're vandalizing the cameras, and they do that basically everywhere now, because they've hired a bunch of thugs.
[03:37:58.669 --> 03:38:00.871]  The police should be refusing.
[03:38:00.871 --> 03:38:08.418]  I mean, the captain should have said, you know, the feds don't have jurisdiction to, like, stop people coming on their boats and taking their cameras.
[03:38:08.418 --> 03:38:09.859]  I mean, it's just... But see...
[03:38:10.782 --> 03:38:13.945]  We're a nation of cowards now, and I'm sorry.
[03:38:13.945 --> 03:38:26.076]  It's cowardice that these policing people follow these dirtbag orders, and they're going to follow other dirtbag orders, but everybody that this has happened to, everybody that this has happened to,
[03:38:27.017 --> 03:38:39.606]  Has got to go to YouTube and other channels and upload their eyewitness reports so that there's a record because I, you know, I get these calls, but I specifically want to hear those people specifically who've been violated.
[03:38:39.606 --> 03:38:42.749]  In fact, write to us at ShowTipsAtInfoWars.com.
[03:38:42.749 --> 03:38:45.291]  Got any photos, video, eyewitness accounts?
[03:38:45.291 --> 03:38:47.292]  We'll try to get it up, but don't wait for us.
[03:38:47.292 --> 03:38:47.953]  You get it up.
[03:38:48.613 --> 03:38:53.075]  And get it out there, because these people need to file complaints.
[03:38:53.075 --> 03:38:55.356]  They need to contact the mainstream media.
[03:38:55.356 --> 03:38:56.996]  We need to continue to expose this.
[03:38:56.996 --> 03:39:02.978]  But for a month, they've been denying they're arresting people and taking cameras and blocking media.
[03:39:02.978 --> 03:39:11.002]  Now, they say, you know what, the Coast Guard says, 10 miles inland, basically martial law, felonies if you tape us.
[03:39:11.002 --> 03:39:13.022]  I mean, this is tyranny.
[03:39:13.022 --> 03:39:14.363]  This is the Soviet Union.
[03:39:15.143 --> 03:39:23.226]  And they're blocking the relief because they want that oil to come in so they can screw up things even more.
[03:39:23.226 --> 03:39:25.167]  This is a treasonous government.
[03:39:25.167 --> 03:39:26.988]  They want to wreck America.
[03:39:26.988 --> 03:39:29.329]  That's their stated UN goal.
[03:39:29.329 --> 03:39:33.550]  And people better realize the government is a pack of crooks.
[03:39:33.550 --> 03:39:36.432]  And they're training their low-level dogs how to rape us.
[03:39:36.432 --> 03:39:37.692]  I'm sorry, go ahead.
[03:39:37.692 --> 03:39:42.514]  Well, my friend said that things are so bad in their opinion
[03:39:42.967 --> 03:39:46.996]  They say it's going to be a very short period of time until people start to die.
[03:39:46.996 --> 03:39:49.902]  They said that they know people that are really sick right now.
[03:39:49.902 --> 03:39:54.311]  They're supplying up, and if they can get out of the bay, they're headed to Argentina.
[03:39:54.873 --> 03:40:09.263]  And then I called friends in Orlando, Florida, that I also know, and they basically confirmed what my other friend in Grand Bay said, and they said that they even saw a couple of small whales out there floating and rotting.
[03:40:09.263 --> 03:40:19.731]  No, no, over a month ago, there's dead sperm whales all over the place, and again, I get emails from the idiot public saying there's no sperm whales in the Gulf of Mexico, and I mean, how dumb are people?
[03:40:19.731 --> 03:40:21.152]  Like, I would just make that up.
[03:40:23.080 --> 03:40:25.464]  I mean, I've seen sperm whales in the Gulf of Mexico.
[03:40:25.464 --> 03:40:26.626]  They're there.
[03:40:26.626 --> 03:40:29.992]  You can Google sperm whales Gulf of Mexico Caribbean.
[03:40:29.992 --> 03:40:32.256]  They're a tropical stinking whale.
[03:40:33.683 --> 03:40:37.605]  Well, nobody ever went broke betting on the ignorance of the American public.
[03:40:37.605 --> 03:40:39.186]  So I'll let you go and have a good one.
[03:40:39.186 --> 03:40:40.006]  Thanks a lot.
[03:40:40.006 --> 03:40:41.146]  Hey, I appreciate your call.
[03:40:41.146 --> 03:40:44.528]  Yeah, that's I know it's almost like a willful ignorance.
[03:40:44.528 --> 03:40:47.449]  It's like if they hear the truth, they rebuke it.
[03:40:47.449 --> 03:40:50.291]  And if they hear a lie, they run over and grab it.
[03:40:50.291 --> 03:40:56.974]  I was down at the beach a month and a half ago, and I and these people were sitting there mumbling and I was walking back on the beach at night.
[03:40:58.320 --> 03:40:59.541]  And it had just gotten dark.
[03:40:59.541 --> 03:41:07.024]  I've been jogging and I was like 15 feet from him and it was like four adults and four females, or three adults, three females.
[03:41:07.024 --> 03:41:10.926]  And they saw me and they said, are you trying to pick my pocket?
[03:41:10.926 --> 03:41:11.907]  And I kind of laughed.
[03:41:11.907 --> 03:41:12.707]  I was like 50 feet away.
[03:41:12.707 --> 03:41:14.208]  And I said, yeah, I'm just going for a jog.
[03:41:14.208 --> 03:41:16.969]  And then, well, you're not jogging.
[03:41:16.969 --> 03:41:20.371]  And I guess they were kind of big guys that were maybe looking for trouble.
[03:41:20.371 --> 03:41:20.491]  And,
[03:41:21.846 --> 03:41:27.710]  I can tell, in fact, there it is, Florida oil spill disaster threatens Gulf of Mexico sperm whales with extinction.
[03:41:27.710 --> 03:41:29.632]  Yep, there's a photo of a dead sperm whale.
[03:41:29.632 --> 03:41:30.812]  Well, I don't show them that.
[03:41:30.812 --> 03:41:42.100]  Side issue, the point is, is that, is that, so I tried to be friendly, and I said, yeah, I ran down to the jetty.
[03:41:42.100 --> 03:41:43.201]  You ought to check it out tomorrow.
[03:41:43.201 --> 03:41:46.924]  There's green sea turtles and dolphins, and they're just everywhere.
[03:41:47.807 --> 03:41:51.908]  I mean, every time I go down to that Port Aransas jetty, there's just dolphins and turtles everywhere.
[03:41:51.908 --> 03:41:54.109]  Anybody who goes there, you can see it for yourself.
[03:41:54.109 --> 03:41:56.430]  Not for long when that oil comes in.
[03:41:56.430 --> 03:42:01.832]  And the woman just said, heh heh heh heh, there's only dolphins in cold water.
[03:42:01.832 --> 03:42:03.092]  There's no dolphins here.
[03:42:03.092 --> 03:42:09.575]  And then they started laughing, going, yeah, and I guess they were like monkeys or something.
[03:42:09.575 --> 03:42:15.597]  They were white yuppies, but I mean, they were like monkeys, like a troop of gorillas or baboons or apes or something.
[03:42:16.784 --> 03:42:26.212]  And it was the fact that they were so cowardly and domesticated deep down inside that a man on the beach 15 feet away from him right after sunset was scary.
[03:42:26.212 --> 03:42:37.681]  And then, kind of like monkeys, because I startled them, I guess, they kind of together hooped and hollered and let me know that I was scum and that I was a liar about dolphins.
[03:42:37.681 --> 03:42:40.143]  I mean, this is domesticated scum.
[03:42:40.143 --> 03:42:43.086]  These are people who were just, I mean, I'm a Texan.
[03:42:43.086 --> 03:42:44.146]  People always, British,
[03:42:44.907 --> 03:42:47.808]  Media comes, French media, Japanese, Russian.
[03:42:47.808 --> 03:42:50.049]  They always say, we've been in Texas for a week.
[03:42:50.049 --> 03:42:51.289]  Everyone's so nice here.
[03:42:51.289 --> 03:42:53.570]  Everyone's so friendly.
[03:42:53.570 --> 03:42:56.672]  And I'm not bashing my fellow Americans because there's people nice all over.
[03:42:56.672 --> 03:43:00.653]  But I mean, I was brought up to be nice and friendly and not look for trouble.
[03:43:00.653 --> 03:43:10.177]  And let me tell you something, it's a wake up call when you're walking along through New York City and you go, officer, can you please tell me where this street is?
[03:43:10.177 --> 03:43:12.858]  Do I look like a phone book to you?
[03:43:14.804 --> 03:43:17.988]  I mean, you know, I mean, I guess that's what we are as America.
[03:43:17.988 --> 03:43:20.712]  It's a bunch of surly, stupid trash.
[03:43:20.712 --> 03:43:22.294]  And I've had enough of it.
[03:43:22.294 --> 03:43:25.498]  OK, I'm nobody's slave and I'm not putting up with it anymore.
[03:43:25.498 --> 03:43:25.799]  All right.
[03:43:25.799 --> 03:43:28.983]  And all you parasites and the rest of you just better get out of my way.
[03:43:29.684 --> 03:43:39.391]  Because I'm here trying to wake up as many people as I can to stand up against you, because I know you're criminals, I know you're trash, and I know you're a bunch of child molesters on top of it.
[03:43:39.391 --> 03:43:48.157]  And it's my job to expose you, scum, and then you're going to show everybody, even the people that are blind out there, just how evil you are, and in the end, you're going to go down.
[03:43:48.157 --> 03:43:51.059]  All right, I'm ranting.
[03:43:51.059 --> 03:43:52.040]  I said I'd cover news.
[03:43:52.040 --> 03:43:54.181]  I'm just out of control today.
[03:43:54.181 --> 03:43:54.882]  Who's up next here?
[03:43:56.607 --> 03:43:59.169]  I'm giving each person one minute because I gotta hit some news.
[03:43:59.169 --> 03:44:01.530]  Annie in New York, go ahead.
[03:44:01.530 --> 03:44:03.291]  I'm awake, Alex.
[03:44:03.291 --> 03:44:05.873]  Just a few things about the Gulf Coast.
[03:44:05.873 --> 03:44:07.874]  I don't know if you saw the Raw Story.
[03:44:07.874 --> 03:44:10.916]  The headline was Marine Biologist Claims U.S.
[03:44:10.916 --> 03:44:14.178]  Coast Guard Involved in Corexit Spraying.
[03:44:14.178 --> 03:44:18.841]  And so that goes along with what the man from New Orleans was saying about
[03:44:19.481 --> 03:44:28.807]  They're spraying it, that BP has purchased more than a third of the world's supply of Corexit, and is in the process of mass-producing it in Shetland, Texas.
[03:44:28.807 --> 03:44:42.135]  The other thing, there was a guest on George Norrie last night, the first hour, Earth Changes Something Media, but he said he's been down in that area, and that the people, he went to the gate like twice, but didn't go through it.
[03:44:42.722 --> 03:44:49.427]  Implying, couldn't say it, that people down in that area are so fed up, they are ready to explode.
[03:44:49.427 --> 03:44:54.130]  And then the last point, because I know you've got other callers, Steve, you're gone for me foods.
[03:44:54.130 --> 03:45:02.556]  My sister lives in East Texas, like 240 miles from the Gulf, and I said to her, even if that stuff doesn't get to you, you're going to have people bolting.
[03:45:03.112 --> 03:45:06.413]  When the stuff hits the fan, so I sent her a seven-day responder.
[03:45:06.413 --> 03:45:07.393]  Hang in there, Alex.
[03:45:07.393 --> 03:45:08.154]  God bless you, ma'am.
[03:45:08.154 --> 03:45:09.394]  I appreciate you.
[03:45:09.394 --> 03:45:12.095]  My reason for having this horrible food is not the oil.
[03:45:12.095 --> 03:45:16.617]  Even though, more and more, it looks like it could be a big problem.
[03:45:16.617 --> 03:45:17.997]  My issue is the depression.
[03:45:17.997 --> 03:45:20.598]  I mean, my issue is... I'll go back to it!
[03:45:22.044 --> 03:45:25.905]  90% of people were rural in the Great Depression.
[03:45:25.905 --> 03:45:28.866]  Now 90% are urban.
[03:45:28.866 --> 03:45:30.886]  10% of our population lives on the land.
[03:45:30.886 --> 03:45:32.867]  Half of them are self-sufficient.
[03:45:32.867 --> 03:45:37.328]  So out of 100 percentage points, 5% are self-sufficient.
[03:45:37.328 --> 03:45:40.409]  That's the university studies I've seen.
[03:45:40.409 --> 03:45:41.489]  Can you imagine
[03:45:42.930 --> 03:45:43.790]  What's gonna happen?
[03:45:43.790 --> 03:45:47.411]  I mean, there's already just homeless people just all over the place where I live.
[03:45:47.411 --> 03:45:52.333]  And they're not the drunk or schizophrenic type let out of a mental institution, the types you normally see.
[03:45:52.333 --> 03:45:57.194]  I mean, I'm starting to see a lot of people that... It makes me angry.
[03:45:57.194 --> 03:46:05.056]  It makes me angry.
[03:46:05.056 --> 03:46:06.617]  Let's go ahead and talk to Matt in New York.
[03:46:06.617 --> 03:46:07.157]  Matt, go ahead.
[03:46:08.268 --> 03:46:08.768]  Oh, I agree.
[03:46:08.768 --> 03:46:09.089]  Absolutely.
[03:46:35.209 --> 03:46:37.650]  Yeah, these investments are funding tyranny.
[03:46:37.650 --> 03:46:40.691]  Hey, I've been saying that for over 10 years and being laughed at.
[03:46:40.691 --> 03:46:43.352]  I told people, the bankers are going to take your pensions.
[03:46:43.352 --> 03:46:47.073]  The same banks that run America have done this in every other country.
[03:46:47.073 --> 03:46:51.155]  And the yuppies would just laugh at me because they just are born to lose.
[03:46:51.155 --> 03:46:52.155]  They're born to get hurt.
[03:46:52.155 --> 03:46:53.856]  They love being scammed.
[03:46:53.856 --> 03:46:54.496]  I don't understand.
[03:46:54.496 --> 03:46:55.196]  They love it.
[03:46:55.196 --> 03:46:58.558]  Their religion is being loser suckers.
[03:46:59.398 --> 03:46:59.999]  Oh, absolutely.
[03:46:59.999 --> 03:47:12.952]  We need to fund the business of freedom with a massive and ongoing fundraising campaign via something that's sort of an action committee that builds a stream of recurring contributions on a weekly, monthly, and annual basis to fund that freedom.
[03:47:12.952 --> 03:47:15.195]  So, you know, this way freedom is fully restored.
[03:47:15.195 --> 03:47:19.439]  And, you know, we're working on a plan to mobilize the people to create, you know, a business plan.
[03:47:19.439 --> 03:47:20.701]  Well, tell me about your plan, Matt.
[03:47:21.141 --> 03:47:28.544]  Well, you know, what it comes down to is, uh, you know, what we need to do is we need to start, uh, creating a fundraiser, an ongoing one.
[03:47:28.544 --> 03:47:39.989]  You know, the stuff you've been doing is great with the, uh, the money bombs and the short-term blast, but what we need to do is we need to get people to buy into freedom just as they do their phony 401k's and their investment
[03:47:40.149 --> 03:47:40.969]  No, no, I agree.
[03:47:40.969 --> 03:47:43.350]  People have to invest in putting their time in.
[03:47:43.350 --> 03:47:50.733]  If you won't go knock on 20 doors tonight to warn them about the New World Order and get past feeling weird, what are you going to do as the tyranny gets worse?
[03:47:50.733 --> 03:47:52.614]  It's the fact that we won't get in the streets.
[03:47:52.614 --> 03:47:54.895]  It's the fact that we won't get in the state houses.
[03:47:54.895 --> 03:47:56.495]  And we won't get aggressive.
[03:47:56.495 --> 03:47:59.396]  And we won't call into all the talk shows and put out newsletters.
[03:47:59.396 --> 03:48:04.778]  And every person doing their little bit is the reason we've got the globalists coming down on us.
[03:48:04.778 --> 03:48:09.080]  Now people are getting moving, so the government's trying to come in to censor the internet.
[03:48:09.520 --> 03:48:11.061]  We've got to have plan B for that.
[03:48:11.061 --> 03:48:12.361]  I appreciate your call.
[03:48:12.361 --> 03:48:13.882]  Very exciting, Matt.
[03:48:13.882 --> 03:48:15.062]  Let's talk to Mike Enmasse.
[03:48:15.062 --> 03:48:16.443]  Go ahead, Mike.
[03:48:16.443 --> 03:48:17.623]  How you doing, Alex?
[03:48:17.623 --> 03:48:19.964]  Good, sir.
[03:48:19.964 --> 03:48:31.849]  I tuned in a little late, so I'm sorry if I'm being redundant, but I wanted to know, what did you think of Andrew Napolitano's conversation with Geraldo and his characterization of the G20 protesters?
[03:48:31.849 --> 03:48:34.731]  I didn't see Andrew Napolitano talk to Geraldo.
[03:48:34.731 --> 03:48:35.331]  What did he say?
[03:48:36.576 --> 03:48:39.998]  It was just a real fluff piece, I thought.
[03:48:39.998 --> 03:48:41.418]  You should check it out.
[03:48:41.418 --> 03:48:47.021]  He kind of let her wobble off the hook, never pinned her elbow down on his interview with the Marines.
[03:48:47.021 --> 03:48:57.126]  And then he was saying that the G20 protesters were wrong, because these were crazies that were looking for more government handouts.
[03:48:58.172 --> 03:49:07.997]  Well, there were a bunch of socialists and communists, and the media only pointed their cameras at them, so I haven't seen what Napolitano said, so I can't speak to it.
[03:49:07.997 --> 03:49:10.619]  I just know he's the best thing on Fox.
[03:49:10.619 --> 03:49:12.300]  But, yeah, no, send me that clip.
[03:49:12.300 --> 03:49:13.901]  I'd like to see it.
[03:49:13.901 --> 03:49:14.541]  Okay.
[03:49:14.541 --> 03:49:15.121]  Thank you.
[03:49:15.121 --> 03:49:16.722]  God bless you.
[03:49:16.722 --> 03:49:18.683]  Thank you, sir.
[03:49:18.683 --> 03:49:21.305]  You know, I said I'd get to all this news, and then here I am taking your calls.
[03:49:22.250 --> 03:49:23.131]  That's it for calls.
[03:49:23.131 --> 03:49:32.317]  I'm sorry, I've got to at least hit the headlines at the end of this segment and the next, but Marty and Michael and Michelle and others, call me back tomorrow, 11 a.m.
[03:49:32.317 --> 03:49:35.840]  Central, 12 noon Eastern, and we'll discuss it.
[03:49:35.840 --> 03:49:37.881]  I mean, here's just some of the headlines I've got.
[03:49:37.881 --> 03:49:39.242]  Look at this Fox News report.
[03:49:39.242 --> 03:49:41.924]  Now, people say, well, that's Fox News.
[03:49:41.924 --> 03:49:48.409]  When I read a mainstream article, I can judge whether it's true or not because I already have the base background knowledge.
[03:49:49.850 --> 03:50:02.157]  And so the media more and more, I mean I was watching Fox News last week and they were admitting that Prozac causes heart disease and heart attacks and cardiovascular problems and brain damage.
[03:50:02.157 --> 03:50:05.139]  Now they knew that in 1981 during the trials.
[03:50:05.139 --> 03:50:09.821]  So I already knew when I was watching Fox News last week that what they were saying was true.
[03:50:09.821 --> 03:50:11.962]  But the question is why are they saying it?
[03:50:11.962 --> 03:50:18.326]  Because the mainstream media has lost all credibility and the mainstream media just to stay in the game.
[03:50:19.448 --> 03:50:23.912]  To even be relevant, has to admit all this now.
[03:50:23.912 --> 03:50:41.267]  I mean, I knew 10 years ago, just like you knew, many of you longer, that globally they standardized, and government would subsidize, and oil companies would subsidize, of thousands of different formulas of plastic, the one formula that leaches an estrogen mimicker that sterilizes men.
[03:50:42.168 --> 03:50:51.572]  And here's Fox News admitting in this article, deadly chemical found in baby bottles banned in Maryland, later in the article they admit it's reducing men's fertility.
[03:50:51.572 --> 03:50:54.973]  This is part of a UN slash eugenics program.
[03:50:54.973 --> 03:50:56.313]  I have the documents.
[03:50:56.313 --> 03:50:58.674]  But I mean it's now admitted!
[03:50:58.674 --> 03:50:59.675]  This is amazing!
[03:50:59.675 --> 03:51:00.155]  Stay with us.
[03:51:01.994 --> 03:51:06.938]  The question is, where should the American people draw their line in the sand?
[03:51:06.938 --> 03:51:07.959]  What have we got?
[03:51:07.959 --> 03:51:10.401]  A republic or a monarchy?
[03:51:10.401 --> 03:51:11.422]  A republic.
[03:51:11.422 --> 03:51:14.064]  It's based on a constitution which protects minority rights.
[03:51:14.064 --> 03:51:16.326]  Not democracy, not mob rule.
[03:51:16.326 --> 03:51:18.348]  Two wolves and a sheep voting on what's for dinner.
[03:51:18.348 --> 03:51:20.029]  So they think they own our land?
[03:51:20.029 --> 03:51:21.351]  They think they own our water?
[03:51:21.351 --> 03:51:21.951]  Children?
[03:51:21.951 --> 03:51:23.072]  Our education?
[03:51:23.072 --> 03:51:23.913]  Our money?
[03:51:23.913 --> 03:51:27.556]  We have to define who we are and what we will tolerate.
[03:51:27.910 --> 03:51:31.617]  Somebody's gonna ask you what you did during the Patriot Uprising.
[03:51:31.617 --> 03:51:32.900]  You are being warned!
[03:51:32.900 --> 03:51:33.922]  We have the facts.

[03:53:53.433 --> 03:54:04.621]  Listen, the reason this is huge news is that for decades people, scientists, chemists, have pointed out that the chemicals in plastics
[03:54:14.810 --> 03:54:27.313]  Particularly two different subtypes are sterilizing and feminizing men and hyper-feminizing women and are really linked to breast cancer, sterility, you name it.
[03:54:27.313 --> 03:54:30.733]  But listen how Fox News makes a joke about this.
[03:54:30.733 --> 03:54:35.154]  Listen, deadly chemical found in baby bottles banned in Maryland.
[03:54:35.154 --> 03:54:41.616]  Men around the world were delighted to have a new excuse to avoid shopping after a deadly chemical.
[03:54:41.616 --> 03:54:41.756]  Oh!
[03:54:41.756 --> 03:54:42.896]  I mean,
[03:54:44.656 --> 03:54:47.777]  And it's only serious articles where the media makes a joke out of it.
[03:54:47.777 --> 03:54:49.558]  It's not just Fox that does this.
[03:54:49.558 --> 03:54:56.100]  Men around the world were delighted to have a new excuse to avoid shopping after a deadly chemical... Oh, a deadly chemical!
[03:54:56.100 --> 03:54:57.160]  Oh, it's so funny!
[03:54:57.160 --> 03:55:06.683]  ...in printed receipts was linked to impotency.
[03:55:06.683 --> 03:55:12.645]  Oh, so the ink that you're handling is sterilizing you.
[03:55:12.645 --> 03:55:13.705]  It's just everywhere.
[03:55:14.738 --> 03:55:21.301]  But it's more serious side effects were highlighted Thursday as a ban on the substance came into effect in Maryland.
[03:55:21.301 --> 03:55:22.501]  Maryland was the fourth U.S.
[03:55:22.501 --> 03:55:37.288]  state to ban the chemical bisphenol A, commonly known as BPA, which was linked to early puberty, childhood obesity, autism, reproductive problems, breast cancer, and other medical issues.
[03:55:38.479 --> 03:55:45.882]  I mean, I've been talking about this for 15 years since I got on air, and I get emails every time I do going, shut up, kook, wear your tinfoil hat.
[03:55:45.882 --> 03:55:47.163]  You people emailing me?
[03:55:47.163 --> 03:55:49.024]  I mean, you like messing your kids up?
[03:55:49.024 --> 03:55:52.405]  You like just laughing at me when I have scientist on?
[03:55:52.405 --> 03:56:02.970]  You think it's funny that the eight major food crops, soybeans, corn, the list goes on, that are filler foods, are designed to sterilize your butt and give your butt cancer in all the major studies?
[03:56:04.158 --> 03:56:05.599]  Those are pharmacological crops.
[03:56:05.599 --> 03:56:07.020]  That wasn't done on accident.
[03:56:07.020 --> 03:56:09.802]  And now they're coming out with hundreds of crops.
[03:56:09.802 --> 03:56:14.745]  From beets, to sugar peas, to everything.
[03:56:14.745 --> 03:56:15.886]  Over a hundred.
[03:56:15.886 --> 03:56:19.249]  You won't be able to escape it.
[03:56:19.249 --> 03:56:23.431]  Over 80% of the corn you eat in this country is GMO.
[03:56:23.431 --> 03:56:27.674]  Honeybees eat it and die a dutter than a hammer.
[03:56:27.674 --> 03:56:30.556]  Monsanto GMO corn linked to organ failure study reveals.
[03:56:32.731 --> 03:56:34.132]  The guys just found that in five seconds.
[03:56:34.132 --> 03:56:35.593]  I don't know how they do that so fast.
[03:56:35.593 --> 03:56:39.016]  Folks, this isn't a game, and I'm not even gonna get to all the rest of the news.
[03:56:39.016 --> 03:56:42.079]  I got to a lot of it today, and I'll try to do a better job tomorrow.
[03:56:42.079 --> 03:56:48.925]  It's just, I'm a regular guy who cares about people, and just wants to have a good life, and wants my children to grow up free.
[03:56:48.925 --> 03:57:00.435]  And I've got all these government textbooks and documents, 60, 70, 80 years ago, right through to today, where they talk about, we're gonna add stuff to the water that cumulatively sterilizes and reduces life expectancy.
[03:57:01.075 --> 03:57:08.760]  Well, we'll be able to hide it by, you know, not teaching it in the medical schools, but it's key that our people be in the top positions over those institutions.
[03:57:08.760 --> 03:57:19.428]  And I'm reading this stuff, and I'm making films showing you the documents, and UN documents about it, I mean... And I gotta have goon-head stupid cops laugh at me at protests.
[03:57:19.428 --> 03:57:21.189]  There's the kook, you Austin cops!
[03:57:21.189 --> 03:57:22.730]  There's the kook, Alex!
[03:57:22.730 --> 03:57:25.532]  You know, you fool, I'm not your enemy.
[03:57:25.532 --> 03:57:27.733]  I want you to have a good life too, but you know what?
[03:57:27.733 --> 03:57:28.514]  It's not funny.
[03:57:29.773 --> 03:57:32.955]  And I'm not just calling you a fool, I'm calling everybody else a fool.
[03:57:32.955 --> 03:57:39.440]  This foolish, silly culture, where everything's a joke, this is not a joke.
[03:57:39.440 --> 03:57:46.426]  This stuff is in the juice, you know, little paper juice packs, is lined with this plastic.
[03:57:46.426 --> 03:57:48.567]  And the water bottles you buy is lined with it.
[03:57:48.567 --> 03:57:52.811]  And if you try to not drink that and drink tap water, they're putting hundreds of deadly chemicals in that.
[03:57:54.298 --> 03:57:57.319]  By design, don't you understand?
[03:57:57.319 --> 03:57:58.880]  Don't you get it?
[03:57:58.880 --> 03:58:00.760]  Don't you understand?
[03:58:00.760 --> 03:58:02.601]  We're all in this together.
[03:58:02.601 --> 03:58:08.543]  This is only a few thousand scientists that are aware of all this information who are consciously supporting it.
[03:58:08.543 --> 03:58:16.186]  The rest of us simply have to face up to how bad it is and get conscious about it and then get focused to remove it.
[03:58:16.186 --> 03:58:18.967]  And we're having a lot of successes and they're getting really mad.
[03:58:18.967 --> 03:58:23.089]  That's why Bill Gates is coming out with mosquitoes that are loaded with viruses that bite you.
[03:58:23.829 --> 03:58:30.053]  Uh, with fake pollen that's released from aircraft that has vaccines that go through the skin and the nasal cavity.
[03:58:30.053 --> 03:58:37.778]  Uh, everything they're doing is about covertly hitting you and hitting you hard and these little smiley face devils think you're too stupid to wake up and fight them.
[03:58:37.778 --> 03:58:38.779]  The choice is up to you.
[03:58:38.779 --> 03:58:39.740]  Great job, crew.
[03:58:39.740 --> 03:58:40.680]  Retransmission starts now.
