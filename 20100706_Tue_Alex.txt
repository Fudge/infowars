[00:00.000 --> 00:12.360]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[00:12.360 --> 00:23.080]  he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones
[00:23.080 --> 00:29.040]  we're live my friends it is Tuesday the 6th day of July 2000 and Timber to be live here
[00:29.040 --> 00:40.200]  for the next four hours the drudge reports top headline is big sis blocks
[00:40.200 --> 00:46.440]  websites with controversial opinions that of course is our headline from
[00:46.440 --> 00:50.960]  yesterday TSA to block websites with controversial opinions is the prison
[00:50.960 --> 00:55.680]  planet dot com article but the drudge report and I'm glad he did link to it
[00:55.680 --> 01:01.280]  CBS news he basically used our headline but linked to CBS news with the
[01:01.280 --> 01:10.320]  headline TSA to block controversial opinions on the web and I'm glad that
[01:10.320 --> 01:16.160]  drudge is covering this I'm glad CBS is covering this because I was driving
[01:16.160 --> 01:21.560]  around this morning taking care of some errands on my way to work and scanning
[01:21.560 --> 01:30.120]  through the talk radio dial and tuned in to a national morning show that was
[01:30.120 --> 01:37.200]  making a joke about our prison planet dot com article making jokes about our
[01:37.200 --> 01:42.920]  conspiracy theories that the government whatever censor the internet
[01:42.920 --> 01:47.400]  because I tuned in and a caller was talking about how we had written an
[01:47.400 --> 01:52.920]  article a few weeks ago titled Obama to have kill switch over internet since
[01:52.920 --> 01:56.440]  then literally hundreds of newspapers have run with a similar headline
[01:56.440 --> 02:01.120]  because that's actually how the government describes it and so I'm
[02:01.120 --> 02:05.160]  really glad that people are making fun of us that means we're dangerous to them
[02:05.160 --> 02:10.400]  it means the system is concerned and it's great to be able to randomly turn on
[02:10.400 --> 02:16.480]  the radio and to hear someone talking about prison planet dot com what's even
[02:16.480 --> 02:22.480]  more incredible is I then went in a store walked out 10 minutes later flipped
[02:22.480 --> 02:29.320]  to a local station and heard a caller talking about how the federal government
[02:29.320 --> 02:35.560]  is using this is a beta test the TSA censoring what's on government
[02:35.560 --> 02:40.680]  computers and the caller was saying it was a beta test very astutely and that
[02:40.680 --> 02:43.840]  the head of the FCC the head of the Federal Trade Commission and others
[02:43.840 --> 02:52.680]  have all called in recent months for censoring the internet as a whole and
[02:52.680 --> 02:59.160]  putting software in to all new computers basically black boxes Australia is
[02:59.160 --> 03:02.920]  already doing this that tracks everything you look at and censors what
[03:02.920 --> 03:09.840]  you can look at so both spies on you and gate keeps and the caller was hung up
[03:09.840 --> 03:16.040]  on and they laughed at him and then played the coast-to-coast AM theme music
[03:16.040 --> 03:20.760]  of when they go to commercial done done done done done done done done which I
[03:20.760 --> 03:23.440]  think make me make interesting music I think coast-to-coast has a lot of
[03:23.440 --> 03:28.560]  important work they also cover way out stuff you know as part of something
[03:28.560 --> 03:33.280]  that's thought-provoking but but still you know the issue was here was this
[03:33.280 --> 03:39.760]  local show first making fun of me and then making fun of another show and
[03:39.760 --> 03:45.000]  it shows just what incredible denial people are in I don't think that
[03:45.000 --> 03:49.360]  national show was making fun of me because there's so much government
[03:49.360 --> 03:56.000]  agents as they're just in denial deep denial because they've heard us talk
[03:56.000 --> 03:59.280]  about this for years how this was coming and now that it is unfolding they're in
[03:59.280 --> 04:05.600]  denial and I don't think the local show or feds they're just under mind control
[04:05.600 --> 04:13.040]  they just basically regurgitate and promote
[04:15.080 --> 04:24.760]  whatever they want they just go along with the system and they think that they
[04:24.760 --> 04:29.280]  can choose whatever the reality is and that the system offers them a nice
[04:29.280 --> 04:33.200]  false reality that everything's fine and we're not even in a recession I mean
[04:33.200 --> 04:35.960]  they're having debates in the media the mainstream media about are we in a
[04:35.960 --> 04:41.080]  recession again is it a double dip we're in a depression all right that's just
[04:41.080 --> 04:46.040]  some of the news that's coming up today and of course your phone calls and we've

[05:10.120 --> 05:14.600]  constitution which protects minority rights not democracy not mob rule two

[08:09.600 --> 08:17.480]  and the GCN radio network it is Tuesday the 6th day of July in 2010 we're gonna
[08:17.480 --> 08:21.960]  be live here for the next four hours thank you so much for joining us my
[08:21.960 --> 08:30.440]  friends I want to repeat basically what I talked about yesterday we have CNBC we
[08:30.440 --> 08:34.360]  have the London Telegraph we have the New York Times the Associated Press
[08:34.360 --> 08:39.960]  Reuters all now saying that we're in a depression not a recession now they've
[08:39.960 --> 08:44.760]  known this for the last two years and they've steadfastly gone along with the
[08:44.760 --> 08:49.360]  government propaganda that we were in this wonderful fabulous recovery now
[08:49.360 --> 08:55.480]  they admit that 46 US states are on the verge of collapsing are have already gone
[08:55.480 --> 09:01.840]  into bankruptcy all over the nation the county cities are laying off large
[09:01.840 --> 09:07.800]  portions of their city and county staff but the taxes are going up that are
[09:07.800 --> 09:12.000]  paid on interest to the private banks because those cities and counties and
[09:12.000 --> 09:16.600]  states were swindled into buying derivatives and God forbid the bankers
[09:16.600 --> 09:20.360]  ever go to jail for this God forbid the Ponzi scheme operators ever get in
[09:20.360 --> 09:26.880]  trouble no our taxes must go up and everything must be paid to the criminals
[09:26.880 --> 09:32.760]  because they control the media and on the media and they say so and they're
[09:32.760 --> 09:41.400]  wearing fancy suits and so like programmed lemmings everyone is marching
[09:41.400 --> 09:46.760]  like like drone robots biological androids off the edge of the cliff and
[09:46.760 --> 09:53.480]  so the system is now shifting into depression they're now shifting into
[09:53.480 --> 09:57.640]  admitting we're in a depression but don't worry they've got a plan to fix it
[09:57.640 --> 10:01.920]  if we'll just pay carbon taxes this is being announced everywhere now in the
[10:01.920 --> 10:07.520]  last week it will just pay carbon taxes to the very same private six banks and
[10:07.520 --> 10:12.160]  give them global government power that's now a quote global governance
[10:12.160 --> 10:16.360]  global government they've got a plan that'll fix it and they'll loan you more
[10:16.360 --> 10:23.200]  money so they've got a plan more taxes that'll further stall the economy and
[10:23.200 --> 10:29.160]  carbon taxes selectively enforced on anybody they want and then when things
[10:29.160 --> 10:34.120]  get worse they'll have more government as the solution and then when things get
[10:34.120 --> 10:43.840]  worse after that they'll have more solutions which will make things worse
[10:43.840 --> 10:55.480]  this is all being done by design and the bureaucrats that are left are the
[10:55.480 --> 11:01.520]  hardest meanest most vicious enforcers and they're going to squeeze the blood
[11:01.520 --> 11:04.760]  out of you and they're going to take your farms and your ranches they're
[11:04.760 --> 11:09.160]  going to harass the Amish off their land they're going to take your children
[11:09.160 --> 11:13.960]  for abortion rackets in the United States England and Europe before your
[11:13.960 --> 11:17.720]  babies even born they're already tracking you through the medical system
[11:17.720 --> 11:23.240]  and have actuaries on what color the child's eyes and hair are going to be
[11:23.240 --> 11:27.720]  and what family wants it they've already got little computer programs on what
[11:27.720 --> 11:36.760]  trumped up charges to put on you until we wake up to the fact that we are the
[11:36.760 --> 11:42.800]  food that's what tyranny is crooks take over government and the people are the
[11:42.800 --> 11:49.040]  food we are the slave labor we are the cannon fodder this is tyranny we know
[11:49.040 --> 11:54.200]  what it looks like the cameras the microphones hidden in lamppost the
[11:54.200 --> 11:59.040]  children trained to spy on their parents thumb-scanning to get school lunches to
[11:59.040 --> 12:03.520]  get library books to go in the tanning salon or to go to work and clock in and
[12:03.520 --> 12:10.880]  clock out we know what tyranny is they just phase it in where all new cell
[12:10.880 --> 12:15.840]  phones track you in real time and the NSA dials in and listens to you with key
[12:15.840 --> 12:20.040]  word software you want a cell phone they all have it that's the way it is
[12:20.040 --> 12:28.000]  standardized worldwide in international agreements in 1996 it's all
[12:28.000 --> 12:38.320]  standardized we had to buy a Byzantine old-fashioned punch-in clock and I was
[12:38.320 --> 12:42.280]  trying to buy a new one from the one we bought a few years ago and it just doesn't
[12:42.280 --> 12:54.720]  exist every system is thumbprint see that's how they get you they're now
[12:54.720 --> 13:00.400]  coming out with ATMs all over the world where you must thumb scan to get the
[13:00.400 --> 13:04.320]  money that everything you do is tracked and controlled and it trains you to
[13:04.320 --> 13:07.840]  completely phase out of the cash and then you're fully under their control
[13:07.840 --> 13:13.160]  everything you do being tracked everything you do being traced now they
[13:13.160 --> 13:16.040]  know your habits they know what you're purchasing they've got a better
[13:16.040 --> 13:20.640]  psychological profile on you they can turn your thumb print off I mean do you
[13:20.640 --> 13:25.920]  understand that criminals took control of society and the banking system and the
[13:25.920 --> 13:32.520]  issuance of currency and credit a long time ago and they figured out that well
[13:32.520 --> 13:37.360]  when we do engage in this Ponzi scheme by design when we do make everybody
[13:37.360 --> 13:41.600]  bankrupt and poor so they will be forced onto socialism and government
[13:41.600 --> 13:47.440]  plantations and reservations that when we do this they're going to rebel and so
[13:47.440 --> 13:52.000]  we've got to shut down the farms the ranches we've got to shut down the
[13:52.000 --> 13:56.360]  industry we've got to shut down the factories we've got to get every one
[13:56.360 --> 14:01.360]  dependent before we pull the rug out from under them and we've got to have
[14:01.360 --> 14:09.160]  Pentagon designed microphones at four-way stops even in small towns
[14:09.160 --> 14:15.840]  nationwide for at least a decade they have hundreds of thousands of
[14:15.840 --> 14:22.800]  microphones hooked into the NSA in parks and in malls and on street corners
[14:22.800 --> 14:30.240]  and in businesses just everywhere hooked into the NSA listening to
[14:30.240 --> 14:35.240]  everything you're doing and if somebody complains and says why is there
[14:35.240 --> 14:40.080]  microphones on that cameras that the feds put in with this local grant they
[14:40.080 --> 14:49.840]  say oh that's a gunshot detector just a little plausible cover story doesn't
[14:49.840 --> 14:54.040]  matter that you go one millimeter beneath the surface and it's all admitted
[14:54.040 --> 14:59.520]  it's NSA all admitted they're tracking everything you're doing with high-def
[14:59.520 --> 15:05.040]  omnidirectional and shotgun mics from hundreds of yards away recording
[15:05.040 --> 15:12.200]  everything you say and sending it through behavioral control analytical
[15:12.200 --> 15:19.200]  systems that gauge the your tone oh yes when it hears you whispering that's what
[15:19.200 --> 15:23.720]  it owns in on and then the public finds out they're actually recording it and
[15:23.720 --> 15:28.360]  listening to it and running it through NSA computers and they say well this way
[15:28.360 --> 15:32.920]  we'll stop family violence if we hear someone cussing at someone or we hear
[15:32.920 --> 15:37.920]  someone sounding angry we go ahead and alert police and now they're coming out
[15:37.920 --> 15:42.920]  admitting oh and then when the camera is now able to zoom in on the persons who
[15:42.920 --> 15:50.640]  sounds angry and then face scans you it takes a digital image in the high-def
[15:50.640 --> 15:55.040]  camera uploads it instantly London admitted five years ago they have these
[15:55.040 --> 15:59.160]  runs it against hundreds of thousands of people in the local area then runs it
[15:59.160 --> 16:05.240]  against larger databases in seconds oh mr. Johnson you were seen yelling at
[16:05.240 --> 16:09.720]  your children well yeah they were running out the street that's abuse we're
[16:09.720 --> 16:16.680]  gonna take your children we're gonna dispatch little secret police who use
[16:16.680 --> 16:24.280]  color of law excuses to take control of you I mean I have all the mainstream news
[16:24.280 --> 16:30.000]  here in front of me all the sudden scores of newspapers the last three days came
[16:30.000 --> 16:36.320]  out and said yes we are recording you yes we are tracking your cell phones in
[16:36.320 --> 16:41.440]  real time yes we can predict what you're going to do with over a 93 percent
[16:41.440 --> 16:46.880]  total certainty 93 percent of the time they have total certainty of where you're
[16:46.880 --> 16:50.200]  going and what you're going to do next before you know it because you're not
[16:50.200 --> 16:58.520]  consciously aware of patterns that you carry out you have a literal crystal
[16:58.520 --> 17:06.040]  ball future prediction modeling system aggressively scanning everything you do
[17:06.040 --> 17:14.440]  that entire world is being weaponized against us police are now being trained
[17:14.440 --> 17:21.080]  not just on bomb retrieval or bomb disposal robots but aggressor robots
[17:21.080 --> 17:33.120]  killer robots sound cannons microwave guns and the only jobs your sons and
[17:33.120 --> 17:38.440]  daughters can get now we'll be servicing these and operating these there's gonna
[17:38.440 --> 17:44.680]  be those of us that are basically slaves and and and work in the slave grids and
[17:44.680 --> 17:49.280]  then there's gonna be the overseers all on their arrogant power trips and the
[17:49.280 --> 17:55.120]  symbiosis the synthesis of the worst of society the most controlling the most
[17:55.120 --> 18:00.440]  thuggish the most hateful the most greedy are gonna rule over us and they're
[18:00.440 --> 18:04.360]  gonna take our women they're gonna abuse our wives they're gonna demand our
[18:04.360 --> 18:08.440]  daughters many of our daughters this is what happens in a tyranny will actually
[18:08.440 --> 18:12.240]  bow down to the black uniforms you'll have to sit there while the Nazi scum
[18:12.240 --> 18:18.800]  is in your house you know bring them coffee kissing up to them you're going
[18:18.800 --> 18:26.800]  to live in hell hell is here hardcore scientific tyranny now now here's what
[18:26.800 --> 18:37.240]  I'm gonna do I'm not gonna take a lot of calls in the last hour today but in the
[18:37.240 --> 18:41.680]  first second and third I am but I I've got a lot of video and audio clips I want
[18:41.680 --> 18:46.080]  to play and so we'll get to some of those today but most of them we'll get to
[18:46.080 --> 18:50.040]  some of those today early in the show but most of them in the last hour I want
[18:50.040 --> 18:52.600]  to play different clips and analyze them here on air and go over some
[18:52.600 --> 18:56.280]  legislation I do have a lot of news to cover as well but I want to open the

[24:18.400 --> 24:22.120]  for the balance of this hour micro vero is coming up we'll cover a lot of the
[24:22.120 --> 24:27.080]  news on the oil spill the situation with Iran what's happening with the economy
[24:27.080 --> 24:35.120]  but CNBC London Telegraph AP Wall Street Journal New York Times they're all
[24:35.120 --> 24:39.960]  saying okay we're in a depression but the solution is given the bankers even
[24:39.960 --> 24:44.520]  more power they'll save us they care about us they're good free market people
[24:44.520 --> 24:48.920]  they created derivatives and destroyed us no they're not free market they're
[24:48.920 --> 24:54.000]  swindling con artist but they have bought off the government put their
[24:54.000 --> 24:58.800]  people in every major regulatory position not just here in the US but in
[24:58.800 --> 25:07.520]  scores of wealthy nations that they're stealing blind it's very elementary but
[25:07.520 --> 25:13.320]  in America now the worship of government has replaced patriotism and so can
[25:13.320 --> 25:19.080]  people wake up fast enough and get serious enough and realize these bankers
[25:19.080 --> 25:22.560]  are going to stage wars they're going to stage oil spills they're going to stage
[25:22.560 --> 25:28.640]  all sorts of diversions to complete their world government and they've got a
[25:28.640 --> 25:32.960]  bunch of militarized police that think it's macho to basically feed on the
[25:32.960 --> 25:37.400]  public and slap around the slaves and the cops have got to ask themselves I
[25:37.400 --> 25:41.440]  mean do you like what's happening here's USA today expect lots of government
[25:41.440 --> 25:45.640]  layoffs at state and local level yeah notice every but the feds are hiring
[25:45.640 --> 25:49.880]  their pay is going up they're hiring but once they're done robbing us blind
[25:49.880 --> 25:54.240]  they're going to lay them off there too but the feds don't care you feds have
[25:54.240 --> 25:58.600]  got another five years or so left before they start getting rid of most of your
[25:58.600 --> 26:04.120]  jobs and then we'll just be a third world wasteland but mission complete you'll
[26:04.120 --> 26:07.200]  still have bigger pot bellies than anybody else and act cool and have all
[26:07.200 --> 26:11.120]  the special badges though let's go ahead and go to Mike and Texas Mike here on
[26:11.120 --> 26:16.680]  the air welcome hey Dallas and Dallas Texas here I just want to let you know
[26:16.680 --> 26:20.920]  that you know it doesn't sound like they're probably having a Texas accent
[26:20.920 --> 26:25.200]  I basically voted with my feet in left New York New Jersey area about six
[26:25.200 --> 26:30.080]  months ago and came to Texas I just couldn't stand that police data was
[26:30.080 --> 26:34.840]  living in out there anymore but Alex I was raised in a family who has a very
[26:34.840 --> 26:39.040]  strong Wall Street ties I won't give you the name over the air but if you want to
[26:39.040 --> 26:41.720]  put me on hold I could give you some names and you can Google them and you
[26:41.720 --> 26:47.600]  can see my family very close family member was part of the team that lobbied
[26:47.600 --> 26:52.440]  for the ERISA legislation that created all these 401k the self-funded
[26:52.440 --> 26:57.040]  retirement plans and I remember sitting around the dare table and around his
[26:57.040 --> 27:03.680]  swimming pool where he said these these plans are doomed to fail what happens
[27:03.680 --> 27:09.480]  now it's when you sell a stock in in mass quantities well this is what this
[27:09.480 --> 27:13.240]  person was telling me from the very beginning these ERISA plans are going
[27:13.240 --> 27:17.560]  to have laws that say when you reach a certain age when the baby boomers all
[27:17.560 --> 27:21.840]  reach a certain age they're going to be forced by law to start liquidating these
[27:21.840 --> 27:27.320]  stocks and the value of their plans is going to crash because when you sell a
[27:27.320 --> 27:31.560]  stock in mass quantities and the baby boomers are the largest group of people
[27:31.560 --> 27:36.600]  who go into retirement in the history of this country those plans the values of
[27:36.600 --> 27:40.760]  them are going to crash so they are when they were lobbying to create that the
[27:40.760 --> 27:46.120]  laws so that you can have a 401k plan they knew they knew who that these plans
[27:46.120 --> 27:50.960]  were doing the failure someday well the system stated goal at the highest levels
[27:50.960 --> 27:55.720]  is destroy industrialized societies and keep people at subsistence level that's
[27:55.720 --> 28:00.800]  why you pay into social security your whole life and it's 64 years old if you
[28:00.800 --> 28:06.600]  want to keep working but also get your social security you get penalized or you
[28:06.600 --> 28:10.200]  lose it and now they're trying to raise it up to 70 and make you work till you're
[28:10.200 --> 28:14.120]  70 and steal all that money you invested and it's because you've got
[28:14.120 --> 28:20.240]  government involvement in it I mean look it's a complex issue because people say
[28:20.240 --> 28:23.480]  well do you have government involved in the stock market or not well you can't
[28:23.480 --> 28:27.720]  have both I mean either people invest in areas of the market and it's not backed
[28:27.720 --> 28:31.840]  up by the government too big to fail or you've got to have government involvement
[28:31.840 --> 28:38.360]  but it's the perfect storm of government involvement in the corrupt stock
[28:38.360 --> 28:42.920]  market that has allowed this to take place and they wanted to take the
[28:42.920 --> 28:47.000]  investment of the baby boomers and make sure they never got it so right as the
[28:47.000 --> 28:51.200]  baby boomers start to retire most of them have lost about half the value of
[28:51.200 --> 28:55.960]  their 401k and they're staying in try to keep that other half they've still got
[28:55.960 --> 28:59.640]  and at the end of the day they're gonna end up with a pittance of what they
[28:59.640 --> 29:04.320]  ever invested but the offshore banks they're gonna get the majority of the
[29:04.320 --> 29:08.200]  capital because they're holding us hostage it it's a complete scam go
[29:08.200 --> 29:13.320]  ahead another thing that's an uncle mine he told me he says if you think these
[29:13.320 --> 29:17.600]  people who are investing in rock our IRAs are gonna get away tax-free no way
[29:17.600 --> 29:20.560]  just like in these other countries where people's pension funds are being
[29:20.560 --> 29:24.360]  stolen from them the government is gonna change the rules you're gonna have
[29:24.360 --> 29:28.920]  invested with post-tax money your whole life and then when you go to withdraw that
[29:28.920 --> 29:34.640]  the government's gonna say I'm sorry because of a national issue we need
[29:34.640 --> 29:38.360]  that money we're gonna have to change the rules and tax if you think that you're
[29:38.360 --> 29:42.520]  gonna get started we had the Bloomberg headline two months ago great
[29:42.520 --> 29:46.240]  point sir I appreciate your call you gotta write an article about it I mean

[31:15.600 --> 31:19.480]  government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is
[31:19.480 --> 31:23.760]  coming number three in some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously
[31:23.760 --> 31:27.920]  overloaded and now new socialist legislation is only compounding the
[31:27.920 --> 31:32.240]  problem number four dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids every
[31:32.240 --> 31:35.960]  year thousands of families lose their power from weather related onages number
[31:35.960 --> 31:40.120]  five a solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of

[33:14.940 --> 33:20.360]  the
[33:24.300 --> 33:29.860]  government isn't screwing things up by action this is a tried-and-meЕТ
[33:29.860 --> 33:39.940]  true system of dependency. This is stated by the UN, by the megacorporations in
[33:39.940 --> 33:45.700]  all their white papers. They know exactly what they're doing. They want you
[33:45.700 --> 33:51.100]  dumbed down. They want you pathetic and wanting and dependent on everything they
[33:51.100 --> 33:56.180]  do. They don't want you independent and strong and red-blooded. They want you
[33:56.180 --> 34:03.460]  domesticated. They want you castrated. And the only places you're allowed to be
[34:03.460 --> 34:09.380]  quote manly or tough guy or macho is within the government system. And then
[34:09.380 --> 34:15.020]  that's in a limited role of kicking the rest of the sheep around. That's how
[34:15.020 --> 34:23.420]  these these different roles are set up. This is all social engineering.
[34:23.420 --> 34:31.100]  We are being socially engineered. We are living in a scientific dictatorship.
[34:31.100 --> 34:38.900]  And that's why it's so important that we reach out to people now because we're
[34:38.900 --> 34:45.500]  now going into the depression. The time for denial is over. It is now admitted
[34:45.500 --> 34:50.500]  that we are living in a high-tech police state. It is now admitted that world
[34:50.500 --> 34:55.740]  government, a private corporate structure of global governance, is being
[34:55.740 --> 35:01.660]  established. How many callers do you hear who've had almost no success trying to
[35:01.660 --> 35:06.620]  wake friends and family up by talking to them? But they give them a copy of Road
[35:06.620 --> 35:10.780]  to Terony. They give them a copy of Endgame, blueprint for global enslavement.
[35:10.780 --> 35:15.060]  They give them a copy of the Obama deception or fall of the Republic or
[35:15.060 --> 35:22.780]  police state for the rise of FEMA. Or don't tread on me, rise of the Republic.
[35:22.780 --> 35:29.540]  And it is waking them up. I'm going to your calls in a moment, but I want to
[35:29.540 --> 35:34.820]  encourage everyone to get our newest film, Invisible Empire, a new world order
[35:34.820 --> 35:41.140]  defined. This is the new world order on trial for the first time ever. The secret
[35:41.140 --> 35:45.460]  agenda of the planet's ruthless superclasses exposed and start to tell
[35:45.460 --> 35:48.940]  this documentary film Chronicles How Men of Power and Influence have worked and
[35:48.940 --> 35:53.020]  stealth for centuries to establish an oppressive world government that is now
[35:53.020 --> 35:56.620]  here. Learn how this global oligarchy controls the populace through drug
[35:56.620 --> 36:00.700]  trafficking, money laundering, staged terror attacks, and media propaganda and
[36:00.700 --> 36:05.260]  debt. The criminal controllers have successfully dominated the globe and are
[36:05.260 --> 36:09.860]  now in the final phase of consolidating power over the individual itself. They
[36:09.860 --> 36:14.740]  are trying to reprogram and change what the human is inherently. They are trying
[36:14.740 --> 36:20.380]  to destroy human structures of family and community and language. Invisible
[36:20.380 --> 36:23.580]  Empire is a damning indictment of the globalists through their own words and
[36:23.580 --> 36:28.660]  documents. Worldwide tyranny isn't coming, it is here. This isn't conspiracy
[36:28.660 --> 36:32.780]  theory, it's conspiracy fact. The new world order is out in the open, all
[36:32.780 --> 36:36.740]  documented in stunning living color. Unelected bureaucrats are establishing
[36:36.740 --> 36:42.180]  regional unions under one super state. Witness their plan for a global tax and
[36:42.180 --> 36:46.100]  a casual surveillance society in which every man, woman, and child is
[36:46.100 --> 36:51.980]  microchipped at birth. The bonus features are Peter Del Scott interview and the
[36:51.980 --> 36:57.820]  G20 protest. It's over three hours of material, 1995. You can also get it

[38:54.540 --> 38:58.700]  anybody not living in a mud hut where they can just hire a local thug group to
[38:58.700 --> 39:02.820]  go in and forcibly sterilize them or just line them up and shoot them so they
[39:02.820 --> 39:06.580]  like to have you where they can fly over in their helicopters and you're in a

[39:16.060 --> 39:21.060]  alright I'm ranting the point is we better expose these terrorists now the
[39:21.060 --> 39:26.300]  social engineer smiley face criminal control freaks that use anthropology
[39:26.300 --> 39:33.820]  sociology to dominate us I don't want to be socially engineered I'm aware of
[39:33.820 --> 39:38.260]  their operation I'm not disillusioned I'm not dumbfounded and bamboozled under
[39:38.260 --> 39:41.380]  a spell we've got to wake up these other zombies and get them out of the
[39:41.380 --> 39:47.260]  matrix now red alert red alert and the films that the best tool out there
[39:47.260 --> 39:54.380]  people ask me you know you'll wake up waking people up is the first move and
[39:54.380 --> 40:02.180]  you're seeing the effect of that every week they have off-year elections or
[40:02.180 --> 40:07.100]  special elections or primaries that are going on right now because they're
[40:07.100 --> 40:13.580]  staggered in different states as you know and the Patriot candidates the
[40:13.580 --> 40:18.180]  anti-nuclear order candidates the anti-incumbent type individuals are
[40:18.180 --> 40:21.940]  winning they can have five thousand dollars or fifty thousand dollars up
[40:21.940 --> 40:26.660]  against people with three or four or five million and they're winning when
[40:26.660 --> 40:31.300]  the media demonizes somebody the general public says they must be good the
[40:31.300 --> 40:36.340]  system is in trouble and they're moving to dominate us right now and I know you
[40:36.340 --> 40:39.780]  know that is listeners and that's why this show is so effective and why it's
[40:39.780 --> 40:43.340]  feared by the new world order but I'm telling you we got to up our games all
[40:43.340 --> 40:48.500]  of us right now we got to get really aggressive with these people that means
[40:48.500 --> 40:52.180]  banner hangs that means bullhorning city hall that means going and speaking and
[40:52.180 --> 40:55.820]  citizens communications in the telecommunications commission or the
[40:55.820 --> 41:01.220]  water district or the school district bring up whatever issues you want just
[41:01.220 --> 41:07.940]  state the facts because our society is being collapsed by design it is only
[41:07.940 --> 41:11.860]  going to get worse from here and they intend to use the crisis to fully
[41:11.860 --> 41:17.940]  domesticate us to fully bankrupt us and to sick the giant hordes of starving
[41:17.940 --> 41:23.060]  people on the tiny middle class that's left they're going to tell poor people
[41:23.060 --> 41:27.100]  that somebody live in a half million dollar house who's got a bank account is
[41:27.100 --> 41:31.780]  the rich and they're going to shake down whatever's left the middle class it's
[41:31.780 --> 41:35.860]  the middle class that goes to the cleaners it's the middle class that goes
[41:35.860 --> 41:39.060]  to the restaurants it's the middle class that goes in your boutique it's the
[41:39.060 --> 41:43.260]  middle class that owns businesses that give you jobs and the globalist want to
[41:43.260 --> 41:49.540]  shut them down just like they've shut the factories down and everything else and
[41:49.540 --> 41:54.500]  the ruling elite are going to use the giant poor starving masses as a weapon
[41:54.500 --> 41:59.900]  we have got to reach out to those people now before they're bankrupt and
[41:59.900 --> 42:03.740]  explain to them why they're about to be bankrupt why they're about to be laid
[42:03.740 --> 42:09.260]  off they haven't already been laid off we've got to explain to them now okay
[42:09.260 --> 42:12.540]  it's only going to get worse and get tougher and become an uphill battle if
[42:12.540 --> 42:18.220]  we don't supercharge now this is an emergency situation alright let's talk
[42:18.220 --> 42:24.660]  to Adam in Missouri you're on the air go ahead yeah thanks for taking my call
[42:24.660 --> 42:30.940]  speaking of getting the word out what I want to do is put a video on YouTube and
[42:30.940 --> 42:36.140]  I just wanted to ask to see your opinion and your take on what's allowed to be
[42:36.140 --> 42:40.540]  used and not allowed to be used I want to use like news clips clips that you had
[42:40.540 --> 42:44.860]  from your radio show clips from your movies Burmese movies stills movies
[42:44.860 --> 42:50.260]  like you know you name it I don't know what's permissible or not Adam Adam I
[42:50.260 --> 42:59.700]  listen number one it's all a gray area and it's taken me 15 years of studying
[42:59.700 --> 43:05.380]  this to even have a basic understanding of it but you'll have you could shoot a
[43:05.380 --> 43:10.220]  video of yourself talking on your front lawn and if somebody doesn't like it
[43:10.220 --> 43:14.820]  they'll go file fake complaints and then what you've got to do is file through
[43:14.820 --> 43:18.740]  YouTube a counter but it doesn't matter they shut down your channel just go
[43:18.740 --> 43:22.660]  start another one but as long as you're using small clips of something people
[43:22.660 --> 43:26.060]  email me all the time and say can I have your permission to hand out bumper
[43:26.060 --> 43:29.420]  stickers with info wars calm on it or can I have your permission to link to
[43:29.420 --> 43:32.860]  you on my website you don't need permission to do that you know you don't
[43:32.860 --> 43:37.180]  need permission to do any of it what you need permission to do is to make
[43:37.180 --> 43:41.660]  copies of my films in whole and sell them and no one has permission to do
[43:41.660 --> 43:45.100]  that because I'd have to give you my copyright and I would lose control of
[43:45.100 --> 43:49.340]  my films but I do authorize people to make copies of all my films and all my
[43:49.340 --> 43:53.900]  work and to give them to people for nonprofit educational purposes I
[43:53.900 --> 43:59.580]  appreciate your call Adam but I mean I wouldn't wait everything's collapsing so
[43:59.580 --> 44:02.820]  of course you can use clips from news to point out what you're saying and then
[44:02.820 --> 44:06.900]  mix it in with things I've said and mix it in with whatever you want that's
[44:06.900 --> 44:11.500]  what the news does you don't think Fox News and CNN asked permission from me
[44:11.500 --> 44:16.100]  whenever they show a clip of my show on CNN which they've done you know I don't
[44:16.100 --> 44:20.220]  know 10 15 times that I've seen the last year no it because it's a short clip
[44:20.220 --> 44:24.900]  when CNN shows 10 seconds of me torturing an iPad to death to illustrate
[44:24.900 --> 44:30.860]  that people care more about things and machines they do people they didn't ask
[44:30.860 --> 44:38.140]  permission okay because it's it's a small clip they're showing it and so
[44:38.140 --> 44:43.180]  knock yourself out Adam Catherine in Maryland you're on the air welcome hi
[44:43.180 --> 44:49.660]  Alex thank you for taking my call listen speaking of red alerts I just I need to
[44:49.660 --> 44:54.740]  speak with you about something that I got really worried about yesterday I was
[44:54.740 --> 44:59.500]  online and I'm aware of everything I watch you on YouTube and I'm aware of
[44:59.500 --> 45:03.420]  everything that's going on but what I wasn't aware of was the heart powers and
[45:03.420 --> 45:09.980]  the chemtrails okay and I saw these on YouTube in a video and then I looked
[45:09.980 --> 45:14.060]  into it further I YouTube these individually in one of your chem trail
[45:14.060 --> 45:19.820]  videos I believe it was produced by you I didn't know what what they were so then
[45:19.820 --> 45:25.300]  later on ironically later on that night I looked at the weather channel online
[45:25.300 --> 45:29.700]  because I always check the local weather you know typed in my zip code 21811 I
[45:29.700 --> 45:36.540]  saw an orange alert okay for air quality and I've never seen this in 25 years
[45:36.540 --> 45:40.700]  I've never seen any kind of air quality alert I've seen high pollen I've seen
[45:40.700 --> 45:46.140]  heat is fire mongering you to sell new taxes I mean in the middle of the
[45:46.140 --> 45:52.740]  countryside they have ozone alerts when ozone actually at many you know levels
[45:52.740 --> 45:57.100]  from what I've read actually is a cleansing agent and is naturally
[45:57.100 --> 46:00.220]  occurring it's just all part of fear mongering I mean they've convinced
[46:00.220 --> 46:06.140]  schoolchildren that that carbon dioxide that plants breathe is a deadly poison
[46:06.140 --> 46:11.780]  but go ahead yeah and I don't buy any of the global warming hype but what I was
[46:11.780 --> 46:16.060]  just all the way for them to rape you and take control of your life exactly yes
[46:16.060 --> 46:19.540]  but but what I was saying was that when I looked into the chemtrails and stuff
[46:19.540 --> 46:24.380]  like that and I looked at it says what are the most ten popular most polluted
[46:24.380 --> 46:29.740]  U.S. cities and it's all back in California Texas Detroit and all those
[46:29.740 --> 46:34.820]  heavily populated industrialized cities and then when you look at the red alert
[46:34.820 --> 46:39.660]  and the orange alert it's all here up here in the northeast and in Maryland is
[46:39.660 --> 46:44.540]  it in right here on the eastern when you got really hot temperatures pockets of
[46:44.540 --> 46:50.980]  ozone other things supposedly can pool down at ground level and it's just it's
[46:50.980 --> 46:56.860]  total fear mongering this is a government that by design has authorized GMO
[46:56.860 --> 47:00.780]  crops that no one else is allowed to eat worldwide and it's banned everywhere
[47:00.780 --> 47:05.900]  that they know sterilizes and attacks the kidneys and other organs of every
[47:05.900 --> 47:10.380]  rodent species they feed it to and they they know in the clinical trials it's
[47:10.380 --> 47:14.140]  hurting humans I mean this is a government that puts hundreds of deadly
[47:14.140 --> 47:19.060]  chemicals by design on purpose in the water and then they tell you oh my gosh
[47:19.060 --> 47:24.700]  ozone action day we're all dead it's hot it's just total fear mongering for new
[47:24.700 --> 47:30.580]  emissions test new taxes Catherine but I appreciate your call yes there's weather
[47:30.580 --> 47:35.100]  modification going on everywhere yes they do have hundreds and hundreds of
[47:35.100 --> 47:41.620]  tower arrays not just in Alaska not just in northern Europe not just in Sweden
[47:41.620 --> 47:46.780]  and other areas and Russia but also in the continental United States there are
[47:46.780 --> 47:52.060]  all sorts of Air Force bases and other facilities that are classified where they
[47:52.060 --> 47:56.700]  are manipulating the weather because the fact that these programs are going on
[47:56.700 --> 48:01.660]  has been declassified thousands of times in thousands of different documents
[48:01.660 --> 48:06.580]  they but the specifics are classified of what exactly they're doing and the old
[48:06.580 --> 48:11.020]  timers 15 years ago said it's barium salts it's aluminum dioxide they're
[48:11.020 --> 48:14.860]  mixing it with the jet fuel so it's compartmentalized and dispersed even the
[48:14.860 --> 48:18.700]  airlines don't know what's going on it's done at the supplier of jet fuel level
[48:18.700 --> 48:22.020]  now we have those government documents now we have the government patents I
[48:22.020 --> 48:26.340]  mean it's just all hidden in plain view just like taking babies blood at birth
[48:26.340 --> 48:30.260]  for a Pentagon database is hidden in plain view just like microphones in
[48:30.260 --> 48:34.780]  every major town and city listening to you piped into the NSA with keyword
[48:34.780 --> 48:39.100]  software scanning everything you're saying is hidden in plain view now just
[48:39.100 --> 48:44.660]  it's all right out in the open that is what's so hellish about this and they
[48:44.660 --> 48:48.860]  know that psychologically most people don't have the courage to face up to
[48:48.860 --> 48:52.980]  what's even admitted and so that people just go into a catatonic state and say
[48:52.980 --> 48:57.500]  look I choose you to only care about football and sex and drinking and then
[48:57.500 --> 49:01.300]  a lot of people look at the facts and say you know what I'm gonna go party I
[49:01.300 --> 49:05.180]  don't care about my kids I don't care about my family I'm gonna go along with
[49:05.180 --> 49:10.180]  this and they make the decision to just to just make a joke about it and more
[49:10.180 --> 49:15.580]  and more people are deciding to make that choice but also many others there's
[49:15.580 --> 49:20.100]  a separation happening people are getting deeper into brainwashing deeper
[49:20.100 --> 49:25.980]  into accepting the lie deeper into into rationalizing and they'll accept
[49:25.980 --> 49:30.700]  anything now they'll accept torture secret arrest you name it they'll watch
[49:30.700 --> 49:34.820]  their neighbor's kids drug away you know they'll watch newborn babies taken for
[49:34.820 --> 49:39.420]  no reason and and just like mainstream news in the US and England are now just
[49:39.420 --> 49:43.620]  going okay the government does have secret quotas it is about money and we
[49:43.620 --> 49:46.660]  are taking your children at birth for no reason and that's just the way it is
[49:46.660 --> 49:49.540]  what you're gonna do about it if you try to fight back we'll just have SWAT
[49:49.540 --> 49:56.340]  teams come and kill you it's just mafia now yeah we're criminal we're gonna do
[49:56.340 --> 50:00.540]  it just like they admit world government just like they admit private
[50:00.540 --> 50:04.180]  banks are gonna take everything over and raise your taxes and that's just the
[50:04.180 --> 50:10.900]  way it is just like Obama comes out now and just openly says I mean I've last
[50:10.900 --> 50:16.220]  night I watched four or five different clips of CNN MSNBC and Fox with the
[50:16.220 --> 50:21.700]  reporters admitting in that they've got all the rock for the jetties to block
[50:21.700 --> 50:24.700]  the oil in the estuaries and they know it's coming from because of the
[50:24.700 --> 50:30.540]  hurricanes and that the government Obama blocked them blocking the estuaries
[50:30.540 --> 50:34.900]  he's just admitted and Obama's blocking the skimmership still that's just the way
[50:34.900 --> 50:46.020]  it is and he'll be hated and then in a couple years we'll get a new president
[50:46.020 --> 50:49.180]  and they'll do everything the globalists want sabotage America and then they'll
[50:49.180 --> 50:52.860]  be hated and a new puppet will be put in meanwhile the bankers just sit up
[50:52.860 --> 50:57.700]  there doing whatever they want this is they're destroying us by design that's
[50:57.700 --> 51:05.620]  the most important point I could make this is not a drill repeat this is not
[51:05.620 --> 51:10.220]  a drill gun cells are on a staggering pace gun prices are going through the
[51:10.220 --> 51:14.380]  roof and that means desperate vicious criminals now want your guns and we'll
[51:14.380 --> 51:18.860]  do anything to get them now a new book reveals powerful secrets for hiding your
[51:18.860 --> 51:22.380]  guns from thieves and looters you'll learn step by step battle-hardened
[51:22.380 --> 51:25.940]  techniques where to hide your guns so criminals will never find them how to

[53:59.180 --> 54:18.420]  I've got a hammer at home over and over again the establishment is so evil they
[54:18.420 --> 54:24.580]  enjoy corruption they enjoy abusing innocence and they have been trying to
[54:24.580 --> 54:30.280]  acclimate and turn the police and military into sickos that have their
[54:30.280 --> 54:36.040]  taste torture of innocence torture of children secret arrest beating people
[54:36.040 --> 54:45.400]  lying framing people by every measurement what the system is pushing here in the
[54:45.400 --> 54:50.480]  United States and in the West is classical hardcore corruption and
[54:50.480 --> 54:58.080]  tyranny and we can't underestimate how much trouble we're in people got to
[54:58.080 --> 55:06.840]  really have it burn in that that we're not in Kansas anymore and I'll say it
[55:06.840 --> 55:12.920]  again I'll say it succinctly everything we've talked about here in the last
[55:12.920 --> 55:19.160]  decade is unfortunately come true or is coming true and a decade in the scheme of
[55:19.160 --> 55:27.480]  human time is a flash in the pan a twinkling of the eye and things are
[55:27.480 --> 55:34.280]  moving so quickly now but compared to the average person's time attention span
[55:34.280 --> 55:40.840]  that's maybe five ten minutes a decade seems like eons and so because we are in
[55:40.840 --> 55:46.040]  lowered attention span mode as a society because television is conditioned us to
[55:46.040 --> 55:52.520]  be that way and other reasons because we are a spectator society we're just
[55:52.520 --> 55:58.240]  completely immobilized where we're just laying back and accepting all of this
[55:58.240 --> 56:03.480]  corruption going wild we are in a depression they are shutting down the
[56:03.480 --> 56:09.520]  state and local governments things are collapsing I know it seems like slow
[56:09.520 --> 56:13.440]  motion to some of you out there but the fact that we've been in a depression for
[56:13.440 --> 56:22.000]  two years and most people I know have now been laid off and every economic
[56:22.000 --> 56:26.280]  measurement shows we're in serious trouble I mean I'm not just saying
[56:26.280 --> 56:31.600]  depression up here because it's a fancy scary word folks I'm freaked out and we
[56:31.600 --> 56:35.080]  need to be freaked out because the crooks in Washington have designed this
[56:35.080 --> 56:40.080]  just like they're doing everything they can to block the oil coming in and and
[56:40.080 --> 56:46.360]  that isn't just words it is a hundred percent confirmed that the federal
[56:46.360 --> 56:52.680]  government is still almost 80 days into this blocking sand berms and rock berms
[56:52.680 --> 57:01.680]  that would protect the estuaries they're just doing it now you watch once the
[57:01.680 --> 57:06.280]  oil comes ashore they're gonna flutter around down there like a beehive that's
[57:06.280 --> 57:10.680]  been hit with a baseball bat and you know the feds will go around and tell
[57:10.680 --> 57:14.840]  everybody that you know thank God they're there to fix the crisis that they
[57:14.840 --> 57:21.400]  have exacerbated I mean this is treason and they're setting the precedent that
[57:21.400 --> 57:25.440]  a you're not allowed to help yourself and that be they're not gonna help you
[57:25.440 --> 57:30.880]  either I mean since when could hundreds of thousands of people stuck in New
[57:30.880 --> 57:36.920]  Orleans not walk out on the highways the highways were above the water from
[57:36.920 --> 57:42.640]  any point in the city the population was blocked in by police with guns and you
[57:42.640 --> 57:47.320]  know what the American people passed the test the American people coward and
[57:47.320 --> 57:52.120]  didn't push their way past the cops those cops in were involved in crimes
[57:52.120 --> 57:57.240]  against humanity and when the public did try to push by they machine gunned them
[57:57.240 --> 58:02.480]  under federal orders and then you notice the cops sent the police to prison
[58:02.480 --> 58:09.080]  federal charges just like you follow orders at Abu Ghraib or Camp X rate of
[58:09.080 --> 58:13.120]  torture and then it comes out you go to prison and the former president gives
[58:13.120 --> 58:18.560]  speeches about how he ordered the torture and now he's proud of it this is
[58:18.560 --> 58:25.800]  all a modus operandi this is a wavelength the signature this is a policy
[58:25.800 --> 58:34.120]  this is a tropism this is how the globalists do it this is their their mode
[58:34.120 --> 58:40.960]  of getting things done and they're gonna do the same thing with the oil

[01:00:54.720 --> 01:01:00.320]  we come back in the second segment for prisonplanet.tv viewers let's talk to
[01:01:00.320 --> 01:01:10.600]  Alec in Texas you're on the air Alec. Hello. Hey buddy. I took the red pill a
[01:01:10.600 --> 01:01:15.920]  long time ago and I'm a prisonplanet member I'd buy your DVDs and spread
[01:01:15.920 --> 01:01:19.440]  them and spread them around. Thank you I couldn't operate without it go ahead. I
[01:01:19.440 --> 01:01:26.400]  have a question for you and it'll take me a minute to frame this question it
[01:01:26.400 --> 01:01:33.280]  seems like the banking or financial cartel that is destroying our society
[01:01:33.280 --> 01:01:40.840]  is out of the what we might call the Anglo-American Dutch Empire I mean
[01:01:40.840 --> 01:01:46.720]  they're sort of headquartered in this empire which has had a great deal of
[01:01:46.720 --> 01:01:52.920]  power in the world for a couple of hundred years and I would suggest that
[01:01:52.920 --> 01:02:00.760]  the source of their power has been the fact that these countries that make up
[01:02:00.760 --> 01:02:07.120]  this empire have traditionally been very strong they've been healthy they've
[01:02:07.120 --> 01:02:14.000]  had liberty they've had excellent education. Yes England and of course the
[01:02:14.000 --> 01:02:17.240]  Dutch have been very free and the United States compared to others not
[01:02:17.240 --> 01:02:20.720]  perfect have been the freest in the world and so incredible wealth was
[01:02:20.720 --> 01:02:27.480]  produced and the populations are very warlike very tough and very smart and so
[01:02:27.480 --> 01:02:34.400]  of course the powerful elites and the banking cartels that were able to
[01:02:34.400 --> 01:02:39.480]  covertly at a corporate level take over our three nations have now set up the
[01:02:39.480 --> 01:02:44.320]  world government and that's that's very well said and they've now made the
[01:02:44.320 --> 01:02:50.280]  decision to fully gut us. Well here's my question it seems to me that they are
[01:02:50.280 --> 01:02:56.320]  destroying their own power base because once they've destroyed our society our
[01:02:56.320 --> 01:03:02.200]  health our education our patriotism our national identities who's gonna look out
[01:03:02.200 --> 01:03:07.080]  after them. Because they're in the end game they're in the end game they've
[01:03:07.080 --> 01:03:11.800]  got to have a worldwide police state be clamped down in their own words so they
[01:03:11.800 --> 01:03:16.640]  can carry out the mass extermination it's gonna slowly go from let's say on
[01:03:16.640 --> 01:03:20.680]  your street you got 20 neighbors you know and five of them have got cancer to
[01:03:20.680 --> 01:03:25.240]  half the neighborhood dies of cancer in a five-year period. You know everyone
[01:03:25.240 --> 01:03:29.320]  you know almost everyone will have kidney failure almost everyone you know
[01:03:29.320 --> 01:03:33.520]  will have diabetes almost everyone you know and they'll be like oh it's the
[01:03:33.520 --> 01:03:39.880]  unhealthy lifestyle no it's the GMO it's the it's the chemical weapons in the
[01:03:39.880 --> 01:03:46.280]  hamburgers in the fries in the nuggets I mean it's silicon it's they know and
[01:03:46.280 --> 01:03:50.560]  they've just been testing their soft kills quietly in the background only
[01:03:50.560 --> 01:03:58.400]  eight of the major foods crops right now are GMO every one of them sterilizes
[01:03:58.400 --> 01:04:02.320]  every rodent species that is fed it and of course they test on rodents because
[01:04:02.320 --> 01:04:05.480]  they're very similar to us and all the studies show our birth weights are down
[01:04:05.480 --> 01:04:10.880]  fertility's way down we're getting soft killed right now it's slow degenerative
[01:04:10.880 --> 01:04:15.560]  weapon system okay and then they have treatments that prop us up and suck all
[01:04:15.560 --> 01:04:20.880]  the money out of us before we die that then extend life but and then if you
[01:04:20.880 --> 01:04:24.160]  take out the averages people always counter with wool what do you mean we
[01:04:24.160 --> 01:04:28.040]  live longer now not if you take out infant mortality from the 20s and 30s
[01:04:28.040 --> 01:04:31.680]  which was higher than you take those numbers out we have a lower life
[01:04:31.680 --> 01:04:40.040]  expectancy and then so it's done anyone this is eugenics they want to kill the
[01:04:40.040 --> 01:04:44.240]  third world people just as much as they want to kill us but they've got to get
[01:04:44.240 --> 01:04:50.360]  us out of the way so we don't bring them to justice you see if we are ever able
[01:04:50.360 --> 01:04:54.960]  to take control of the Empire again they're gonna be in a lot of trouble so
[01:04:54.960 --> 01:04:58.400]  they're just gonna chemically lobotomize this where we can't stand up against
[01:04:58.400 --> 01:05:04.080]  them and that's going on now the fall of America and the Western world is an

[01:08:16.720 --> 01:08:22.320]  the radio show in living color at prisonplanet.tv Mike Rivera joining us
[01:08:22.320 --> 01:08:26.920]  from Hawaii via video Skype here in just a moment thank you for joining us
[01:08:26.920 --> 01:08:31.440]  we'll talk about a host of issues living but here's a report US warships cause
[01:08:31.440 --> 01:08:36.440]  anger in Costa Rica which is all over the Latin American news all over the
[01:08:36.440 --> 01:08:40.640]  European news but very little news here in the United States Costa Rica has
[01:08:40.640 --> 01:08:46.480]  allowed 46 US warships 7,000 Marines to enter the country despite objections by
[01:08:46.480 --> 01:08:50.400]  the opposition parties which describe the move as illegal Costa Rican opposition
[01:08:50.400 --> 01:08:54.000]  parties to announce the decision of legislative assembly describing it as
[01:08:54.000 --> 01:08:59.280]  illegal in violation of national sovereignty and it goes on that they're
[01:08:59.280 --> 01:09:02.800]  going to be engaged basically in combat operations fighting drug traffickers
[01:09:02.800 --> 01:09:07.400]  that means people that haven't laundered their money through the US banks
[01:09:07.400 --> 01:09:14.600]  incredible now let's dovetail that with some background Christina Ferrer's if
[01:09:14.600 --> 01:09:24.000]  I'm pronouncing that correctly Ferrer Christine Ferrer of Costa Rica selected
[01:09:24.000 --> 01:09:30.200]  as the new UN climate chief that give me a document cam shot I want to show
[01:09:30.200 --> 01:09:37.280]  people a image of this steely-eyed wicked woman and there's the lady that's
[01:09:37.280 --> 01:09:41.240]  going to help worldwide bring total tyranny in and put taxes on what humans
[01:09:41.240 --> 01:09:51.400]  exhale and then if you notice her father was president Jose Ferrer of Costa
[01:09:51.400 --> 01:09:57.560]  Rica abolished the military of Costa Rica after the victory of the civil war that
[01:09:57.560 --> 01:10:03.400]  year because he didn't want to have a grip to overthrow him in a ceremony in
[01:10:03.400 --> 01:10:13.840]  the main government facility and it goes on to talk about how they got rid of
[01:10:13.840 --> 01:10:19.360]  their military I mean this is insane ladies and gentlemen our country has
[01:10:19.360 --> 01:10:23.640]  been taken over by foreign corporations we are being overthrown just like a
[01:10:23.640 --> 01:10:28.560]  third-world country and looted and robbed and we must stand up and say no to
[01:10:28.560 --> 01:10:33.680]  it now going to Mike Rivera joining us of course he runs what really happened
[01:10:33.680 --> 01:10:40.600]  calm we just joined us I'm Alex Jones from info wars calm we are gonna have
[01:10:40.600 --> 01:10:44.560]  him with us for at least the rest of this hour and we're also gonna have open
[01:10:44.560 --> 01:10:48.040]  phones throughout the hour on any subject you want to raise Mike can comment
[01:10:48.040 --> 01:10:53.520]  on it but I he joins us once a month I wanted to get his take out of the gates
[01:10:53.520 --> 01:10:59.200]  on the entire history of the oil spill and the fact that every day I turn the
[01:10:59.200 --> 01:11:04.160]  news on and it's admitted that still the feds are blocking the skimmerships the
[01:11:04.160 --> 01:11:15.000]  feds are blocking the the states and BP from rock jetty's sand jetty's and
[01:11:15.000 --> 01:11:20.320]  Obama's approval rating has fallen even further and of course that's his job to
[01:11:20.320 --> 01:11:24.320]  be built up as a messianic savior than to be destroyed and a new puppet comes
[01:11:24.320 --> 01:11:30.240]  in but why does the establishment want that oil to come ashore when the
[01:11:30.240 --> 01:11:34.000]  hurricane season kicks in here in the next month Mike what's your take on
[01:11:34.000 --> 01:11:40.200]  this I'm not so sure that they want the oil to come ashore so much as we're
[01:11:40.200 --> 01:11:45.280]  dealing with governmental arrogance and I like to call this disaster America's
[01:11:45.280 --> 01:11:49.400]  chair noble and if you go back and you look at the Soviet Union's response when
[01:11:49.400 --> 01:11:53.880]  the reactor blew up for the first several weeks there they kept saying no no
[01:11:53.880 --> 01:11:58.600]  we got it taken care of we don't need any help it was seen as a political
[01:11:58.600 --> 01:12:03.000]  negative to admit the situation was so out of control that they needed help
[01:12:03.000 --> 01:12:06.600]  from other countries there is another aspect in that if you look at the
[01:12:06.600 --> 01:12:11.080]  specific methodologies that are being chosen to deal with this catastrophe all
[01:12:11.080 --> 01:12:16.400]  of them are based on BP's desire to somehow corral up the oil and be able to
[01:12:16.400 --> 01:12:19.640]  resell it that's why they're not bringing in the microbes that's why they're not
[01:12:19.640 --> 01:12:23.040]  bringing in foreign skimmers that might wind up taking the oil back to their
[01:12:23.040 --> 01:12:28.360]  foreign home ports we're seeing the use of this corrects it which is not really
[01:12:28.360 --> 01:12:32.480]  dispersant it lowers the oil in the water to get it out of sight we know the
[01:12:32.480 --> 01:12:36.080]  company that makes that is partly owned by Goldman Sachs so it's all being driven
[01:12:36.080 --> 01:12:41.800]  by money and greed and an attempt to minimize the losses and somehow salvage
[01:12:41.800 --> 01:12:45.600]  the oil for resale and the rest of it is just saving face there have been so
[01:12:45.600 --> 01:12:49.120]  many things that were done wrong during this whole operation I think one of the
[01:12:49.120 --> 01:12:53.280]  reasons they don't want any outsiders coming in from anywhere is that once the
[01:12:53.280 --> 01:12:57.400]  outsider see how bad things are there it's gonna go public around the world
[01:12:57.400 --> 01:13:02.240]  just how completely this was messed up from day one well my guy agree with you
[01:13:02.240 --> 01:13:10.040]  that the bureaucracy not just of government but a BP slows everything
[01:13:10.040 --> 01:13:15.320]  down because everything BP does has to be about some business partner or
[01:13:15.320 --> 01:13:21.440]  subsidiary like Goldman Sachs were just a year ago the chairman of Goldman Sachs
[01:13:21.440 --> 01:13:27.120]  as you know but for some out there that may not was also the head of BP so these
[01:13:27.120 --> 01:13:31.720]  are Siamese twins we're talking about and BP it's come out is paying its
[01:13:31.720 --> 01:13:36.840]  subsidiaries to do the cleanup so they're saying oh we've spent $3 billion
[01:13:36.840 --> 01:13:43.200]  here with the cleanup but they're really just using it as a write-off and also as
[01:13:43.200 --> 01:13:47.640]  a way to pay money into their subsidiaries and the $20 billion they've
[01:13:47.640 --> 01:13:53.360]  agreed to is just a new derivative fund where they're going to basically just
[01:13:53.360 --> 01:13:58.560]  invest that in the market and then take the quote profits of that $20
[01:13:58.560 --> 01:14:04.600]  billion and use it to pay for the cleanup and then in the process it is
[01:14:04.600 --> 01:14:09.000]  going to make the disaster much worse and this really does show criminal
[01:14:09.000 --> 01:14:14.560]  negligence by Obama and by BP but I think it goes further than that I mean not
[01:14:14.560 --> 01:14:19.960]  letting the counties and the cities and the states and I and I don't have to go
[01:14:19.960 --> 01:14:23.840]  over the instances of this everybody's seen it on the news just last night I
[01:14:23.840 --> 01:14:28.040]  watched Anderson Cooper and they had reporters there with giant mountains of
[01:14:28.040 --> 01:14:32.280]  rock that are there to block up the estuaries and save you know for those
[01:14:32.280 --> 01:14:37.520]  that don't know Louisiana is like a maze of rivers and marshes and you know
[01:14:37.520 --> 01:14:41.560]  literally tens of thousands of square miles of that they're not allowed to
[01:14:41.560 --> 01:14:50.280]  protect it and it says that even on CNN admits Obama is blocking it so it the
[01:14:50.280 --> 01:14:55.640]  only way to look at this is that they do want it to be as bad as possible or I
[01:14:55.640 --> 01:15:00.320]  guess you're saying that you just think they're completely oblivious well I
[01:15:00.320 --> 01:15:04.080]  think they're partly oblivious but there is another agenda behind here because
[01:15:04.080 --> 01:15:07.600]  over the weekend there was an announcement that the environmental protection
[01:15:07.600 --> 01:15:13.640]  agency was forcing a whole bunch of Texas refineries to refile their
[01:15:13.640 --> 01:15:17.840]  environmental impact paperwork they've been this this program in place for
[01:15:17.840 --> 01:15:22.520]  about 16 years under which the refineries were operating and the EPA just
[01:15:22.520 --> 01:15:26.200]  canceled it so now all the refineries have to halt operations while they go
[01:15:26.200 --> 01:15:30.600]  through that whole paperwork process of getting a new license to operate now
[01:15:30.600 --> 01:15:34.440]  remember just before the deep water horizon exploded the Obama administration
[01:15:34.440 --> 01:15:38.640]  was handing out waivers and exemptions for EPA requirements to all those gulf
[01:15:38.640 --> 01:15:43.400]  drilling platforms so there's one theory going on here that Obama is using
[01:15:43.400 --> 01:15:49.760]  this disaster to trigger an oil crisis and an oil price crisis as a means of
[01:15:49.760 --> 01:15:54.240]  blackmailing his cap and credit tax through Congress and through the American
[01:15:54.240 --> 01:15:57.160]  people I mean today you're seeing the headlines they're talking about oh
[01:15:57.160 --> 01:16:00.880]  there's a heat wave in New England and it's not just hot it's dangerous they're
[01:16:00.880 --> 01:16:04.720]  trying to scare us back into that cap and credit tax situation because without
[01:16:04.720 --> 01:16:08.920]  that new tax the federal government is running out of money and so I think it's
[01:16:08.920 --> 01:16:12.880]  just like the way Obama is using the immigration crisis in Arizona to push
[01:16:12.880 --> 01:16:17.480]  through his amnesty program I think he's trying to use the oil disaster and the
[01:16:17.480 --> 01:16:21.560]  refinery shutdowns to blackmail Congress into going along with this carbon
[01:16:21.560 --> 01:16:25.680]  cap and credit tax program well there's no doubt Mike that you're absolutely
[01:16:25.680 --> 01:16:31.040]  right in fact I dovetail that with senator Kyle three weeks ago in a
[01:16:31.040 --> 01:16:35.160]  speech saying we played it here that he was in a private meeting with Obama and
[01:16:35.160 --> 01:16:40.400]  said we're getting thousands of dead here on the US side Mexico has collapsed
[01:16:40.400 --> 01:16:46.240]  the illegals are past Tucson it's literally Wild Wild West they're putting
[01:16:46.240 --> 01:16:49.960]  up signs saying the public can't go down certain highways or international
[01:16:49.960 --> 01:16:55.280]  parks and Obama said yes I know the crisis is good I'm not gonna fix the
[01:16:55.280 --> 01:17:00.200]  problem down there or allow the states to fix it themselves until I've gotten
[01:17:00.200 --> 01:17:07.480]  my amnesty passed so there you see a great window into the mindset of these
[01:17:07.480 --> 01:17:11.880]  people of not letting a good crisis go to waste as Rahm Emanuel said and you
[01:17:11.880 --> 01:17:16.480]  have BP giving the suspicious orders that their own engineers told them would
[01:17:16.480 --> 01:17:23.400]  make the well come in early and cause a spill you now have them blocking the
[01:17:23.400 --> 01:17:29.360]  aid effort for right up to 80 days now and just a day or two you've got all
[01:17:29.360 --> 01:17:33.720]  that going on and you've got Obama saying cap and trade will fix this give
[01:17:33.720 --> 01:17:38.560]  me a carbon tax which what does it new tax have to do with any of this and
[01:17:38.560 --> 01:17:43.800]  you've got select top oil companies from the Associated Press article in 2000
[01:17:43.800 --> 01:17:53.920]  when they sued and got the inter corporate minutes from 1995 and 96 where
[01:17:53.920 --> 01:17:57.880]  the big 10 oil companies met and said there's all these miners that are
[01:17:57.880 --> 01:18:00.840]  cutting in you know all these minor oil companies that are cutting in on our
[01:18:00.840 --> 01:18:05.480]  operations let's regulate for more regulations to shut down more
[01:18:05.480 --> 01:18:09.280]  refineries push for that let's fund environmental groups to do that let's
[01:18:09.280 --> 01:18:12.280]  fund environmental groups to not let oil come in with a new pipeline out of
[01:18:12.280 --> 01:18:16.720]  Alaska and let's buy up refineries and shut them down to create an
[01:18:16.720 --> 01:18:21.360]  artificial bottleneck and the public will never look for an oil company to
[01:18:21.360 --> 01:18:25.320]  actually be in bed with Obama but we know it's BP that created the cap and
[01:18:25.320 --> 01:18:30.200]  trade tax in 95 with Ken lay of Enron and and Bill Clinton and Al Gore we know
[01:18:30.200 --> 01:18:33.880]  they're the top globalist funding cap and trade worldwide we know they've
[01:18:33.880 --> 01:18:38.880]  invested tens of billions in it we know they're subsidiaries of Goldman Sachs so
[01:18:38.880 --> 01:18:45.240]  absolutely if you look at this there's no other way to come away but this is a
[01:18:45.240 --> 01:18:51.560]  crisis they're at least using to bring this in but Mike expanding on that do
[01:18:51.560 --> 01:18:55.520]  you think the evidence leans towards them actually blowing the oil well no I
[01:18:55.520 --> 01:19:00.360]  actually do not I I know they would like the public to think that because if
[01:19:00.360 --> 01:19:04.920]  there's some unknown and unknowable saboteur or terrorists that blew up the
[01:19:04.920 --> 01:19:08.720]  well then British Petroleum is off the financial hook for all the damage it
[01:19:08.720 --> 01:19:12.560]  caused and the Obama administration is off the hook for the negligence of
[01:19:12.560 --> 01:19:16.480]  allowing the MMS to just sit there surfing internet porn in on their
[01:19:16.480 --> 01:19:20.200]  office computers while British Petroleum was just out there engaging in all this
[01:19:20.200 --> 01:19:24.040]  reckless behavior there is one other aspect we need to look at and this may
[01:19:24.040 --> 01:19:28.400]  account for a lot of the secrecy that we're seeing around the BP disaster and
[01:19:28.400 --> 01:19:33.400]  that is we're hearing some reports that the Obama administration as a quid pro
[01:19:33.400 --> 01:19:37.040]  fall for all those waivers pushed British Petroleum to bring in the well
[01:19:37.040 --> 01:19:42.720]  sooner to offset a potential loss during the attack on Iran well we know they've
[01:19:42.720 --> 01:19:47.560]  been racing to drill new wells in the Gulf and on shore in the last year stay
[01:19:47.560 --> 01:19:51.560]  there come back and elaborate on that and and and where you think this well
[01:19:51.560 --> 01:19:56.720]  spills going then we'll talk about Iran and a lot more with Mike Rivera and of
[01:19:56.720 --> 01:19:59.720]  course then your phone calls key information straight ahead stay with

[01:22:24.960 --> 01:22:29.400]  ever experienced this is not only a transfer of power to an institution that
[01:22:29.400 --> 01:22:32.600]  is not accountable to our elected government but has also caused the
[01:22:32.600 --> 01:22:36.680]  dollar to lose more than 90 cents of its original value now foreign governments
[01:22:36.680 --> 01:22:40.920]  are trying to divest themselves from this once world reserve currency hi this

[01:24:26.800 --> 01:24:32.960]  okay let's go back to Mike Rivera Mike you got cut off by the break I go back
[01:24:32.960 --> 01:24:38.160]  into that point because when I study globalist operations they always hit
[01:24:38.160 --> 01:24:42.480]  on multi fronts and some of these have been declassified and so we know that
[01:24:42.480 --> 01:24:46.120]  they have discussions about this will be good to jack up oil prices it'll be a
[01:24:46.120 --> 01:24:50.520]  good distraction when we hit Iran it'll be a good way to pass the cap and trade
[01:24:50.520 --> 01:24:55.080]  tax it'll be a good way to get more power into FEMA and to shut down more
[01:24:55.080 --> 01:24:59.200]  industry in the United States for globalism let's go ahead and go with it
[01:24:59.200 --> 01:25:05.120]  but but we do know that two months before they BP gave orders to Anna Darko
[01:25:05.120 --> 01:25:09.960]  and Halliburton and that their own engineers said this will cause the well
[01:25:09.960 --> 01:25:13.920]  to blow and it did start leaking two months before and there's been a cover
[01:25:13.920 --> 01:25:20.960]  up of that so regardless BP gave orders BP gave orders that they that they were
[01:25:20.960 --> 01:25:25.680]  told would cause it to blow up go ahead yeah basically it's been known long
[01:25:25.680 --> 01:25:28.640]  before the actual explosion of the Deepwater horizon that they were
[01:25:28.640 --> 01:25:33.000]  encountering problems because they were drilling down deeper and into areas of
[01:25:33.000 --> 01:25:36.440]  far greater pressure than the technologies designed to deal with a lot
[01:25:36.440 --> 01:25:40.640]  of what BP is using in the Gulf dates back to the 1970s they haven't been
[01:25:40.640 --> 01:25:46.560]  upgrading their equipment because with that 75 I think a 75 million dollar cap
[01:25:46.560 --> 01:25:51.520]  on damages there was no financial incentive to invest in putting newer
[01:25:51.520 --> 01:25:56.280]  safety equipment like acoustic decouplers acoustic shutoffs and things like that
[01:25:56.280 --> 01:26:00.160]  but what we're hearing from certain sources is that even though they were
[01:26:00.160 --> 01:26:04.520]  experiencing problems the pressure to keep going and to try and reach that
[01:26:04.520 --> 01:26:08.640]  oil was actually coming from the administration as the quid pro quo for
[01:26:08.640 --> 01:26:12.600]  all the EPA waivers and exemptions that were being handed out and this story
[01:26:12.600 --> 01:26:17.160]  that we're getting is that the Obama administration wanted that huge reservoir
[01:26:17.160 --> 01:26:22.080]  of oil in the Gulf on tap and ready to deliver because when they attack Iran
[01:26:22.080 --> 01:26:26.360]  and by the way Netanyahu's on TV right now screaming about why you Americans
[01:26:26.360 --> 01:26:30.480]  have to go kill Iran force it's going to disrupt oil traffic through the Strait
[01:26:30.480 --> 01:26:35.920]  of Hormuz and the Obama administration wanted that Gulf oil online to be able
[01:26:35.920 --> 01:26:38.800]  to go to all the other allies are on the world and say don't worry about the
[01:26:38.800 --> 01:26:42.240]  disruption to your oil flow we've got it covered from the Gulf of Mexico
[01:26:42.240 --> 01:26:45.880]  you can come come get all of your oil from British petroleum while the Mid
[01:26:45.880 --> 01:26:49.520]  East oil fields are unavailable and that's why even though they were running
[01:26:49.520 --> 01:26:53.560]  into difficulties the pressure to keep going and keep going and keep going was
[01:26:53.560 --> 01:26:58.920]  there and now we've had the blow-up and we we know that ever since the deep
[01:26:58.920 --> 01:27:02.400]  water horizon explosion the administration continues to hand out
[01:27:02.400 --> 01:27:07.200]  these exemptions and waivers and permits for more of these deep water Gulf
[01:27:07.200 --> 01:27:12.200]  drilling operations to continue I think this whole thing about blocking the
[01:27:12.200 --> 01:27:16.120]  drilling and then overturned by the court was political theater to make Obama
[01:27:16.120 --> 01:27:18.920]  look like he cared about the environment to the American people ahead of the
[01:27:18.920 --> 01:27:22.520]  elections but the reality is the drilling is continuing and they're still
[01:27:22.520 --> 01:27:25.480]  obviously moving to an attack on Iran well let me go back something that
[01:27:25.480 --> 01:27:32.000]  backs up your your view on that is that we know Obama out of 3,000 plus wells in
[01:27:32.000 --> 01:27:37.600]  the Gulf we've looked the number up it's over 3,000 that specifically he gave a
[01:27:37.600 --> 01:27:43.800]  presidential award for safety to that particular rig a month before all this
[01:27:43.800 --> 01:27:49.120]  happened and now we know that rig was having trouble a month before that it
[01:27:49.120 --> 01:27:53.720]  was having trouble two months before and so a month before it blew out they
[01:27:53.720 --> 01:27:57.640]  already knew it had problems they'd already been out there and so it's very
[01:27:57.640 --> 01:28:02.400]  bizarre that they're there giving them safety awards even though they knew the
[01:28:02.400 --> 01:28:06.800]  well was already cracked and already leaking and having problems and they
[01:28:06.800 --> 01:28:13.040]  and I went and looked up the filings they estimate between 2 and 4 billion 2 and
[01:28:13.040 --> 01:28:21.400]  4 billion gallons of oil is in that well so it's basically 99% still full 70 plus
[01:28:21.400 --> 01:28:27.680]  days in and so they did know this was a mega mega find and that does make sense
[01:28:27.680 --> 01:28:33.080]  to you know to get that oil supply ready quickly domestically because BP is at
[01:28:33.080 --> 01:28:36.480]  the top of the food chain I mean the US oil companies weren't ever allowed to
[01:28:36.480 --> 01:28:41.880]  have Alaskan oil only BP is allowed to have it for over 25 years BP is is is
[01:28:41.880 --> 01:28:46.680]  a predominantly owned by the Queen of England and we have to ask ourselves you
[01:28:46.680 --> 01:28:50.920]  know there why is this happening Mike how do you see this ending though as the
[01:28:50.920 --> 01:28:59.680]  hurricanes drive 150 million gallons or more towards landfall if the I mean if
[01:28:59.680 --> 01:29:03.720]  the media is hysterical over the small amounts that have come to shore what's
[01:29:03.720 --> 01:29:08.480]  gonna happen when that hits I think it absolutely is the worst environmental
[01:29:08.480 --> 01:29:12.000]  disaster in the history of the world I don't think there's a thing they can do
[01:29:12.000 --> 01:29:15.920]  about it we are continually getting reports from citizen investigators who
[01:29:15.920 --> 01:29:21.240]  are defying the heavy fines and class D felony that BP has put out there for
[01:29:21.240 --> 01:29:24.960]  anybody daring to use a camera to show the extent of this bill and we're
[01:29:24.960 --> 01:29:28.800]  finding out that what you piece doing it's just putting new sand on the beach
[01:29:28.800 --> 01:29:32.440]  they're not cleaning up the oil they're not cleaning up the contamination they're
[01:29:32.440 --> 01:29:36.200]  just putting new sand over it and taking a picture to say see it's all better but
[01:29:36.200 --> 01:29:39.880]  every time the waves come in and wash the sand away the oil is coming up again
[01:29:39.880 --> 01:29:43.060]  they don't know how to deal with this thing you know what you know what stay
[01:29:43.060 --> 01:29:51.680]  there let's talk about felonies if you try to videotape in America we're on the

[01:32:04.240 --> 01:32:08.440]  number one new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric
[01:32:08.440 --> 01:32:12.720]  bill number two our new energies are wants to control how much power your
[01:32:12.720 --> 01:32:16.680]  electric company allows you to have it's true total government control of
[01:32:16.680 --> 01:32:21.080]  electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming number three in
[01:32:21.080 --> 01:32:25.360]  some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously overloaded and now new
[01:32:25.360 --> 01:32:29.080]  socialist legislation is only compounding the problem number four
[01:32:29.080 --> 01:32:33.240]  dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids every year thousands of
[01:32:33.240 --> 01:32:37.200]  families lose their power from weather related onages number five a solar power
[01:32:37.200 --> 01:32:41.040]  generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind folks I
[01:32:41.040 --> 01:32:43.760]  really believe in the solar power generators offered by solutions from
[01:32:43.760 --> 01:32:48.720]  science one of my oldest sponsors you can get more information at WWW dot my
[01:32:48.720 --> 01:32:52.840]  solar backup dot com that's my solar backup dot com remember the government
[01:32:52.840 --> 01:33:11.640]  doesn't own the sun should go to my solar backup dot com or call 1-877-327-0365
[01:33:23.160 --> 01:33:28.000]  okay my friends we are back live here on the radio we're also simulcasting at
[01:33:28.000 --> 01:33:33.720]  prisonplanet.tv and living video color joining us from Hawaii is Mike Rivera
[01:33:33.720 --> 01:33:37.520]  we're going to your phone calls coming up here in about 10 minutes on a host of
[01:33:37.520 --> 01:33:42.040]  subjects and Mike's very well versed an intelligent fellow and you can get his
[01:33:42.040 --> 01:33:45.280]  perspective and my perspective or give us your perspective on any of the
[01:33:45.280 --> 01:33:52.880]  subjects you raise now continuing here with the point you were trying to get at
[01:33:52.880 --> 01:33:59.360]  as we went to break concerning BP and and where you see this crisis going
[01:33:59.360 --> 01:34:05.800]  calling it the America's Chernobyl one of our guests this week compared it to
[01:34:05.800 --> 01:34:14.400]  the dust bowl that we saw in the 1920s that populated California with
[01:34:14.400 --> 01:34:20.640]  Oklahomans and Texans and people from Kansas I mean definitely give the oil
[01:34:20.640 --> 01:34:26.280]  spill well be give us your take on it well you're absolutely right in the
[01:34:26.280 --> 01:34:31.120]  economic and sociological sense this is a new dust bowl the Gulf Coast states
[01:34:31.120 --> 01:34:34.800]  every one of them has been contaminated with oil and it's important to
[01:34:34.800 --> 01:34:41.320]  remember that the danger and the risk is far beyond the tar balls and the brown
[01:34:41.320 --> 01:34:46.640]  sludge that you can see because along with those contaminants there are
[01:34:46.640 --> 01:34:50.320]  chemicals coming out of the well in large volume that are invisible that are
[01:34:50.320 --> 01:34:55.120]  dissolved in the water including methane hydrogen sulfide even arsenic is coming
[01:34:55.120 --> 01:34:58.880]  out of that well and that's a tasteless odorless colorless material dissolved
[01:34:58.880 --> 01:35:02.960]  in water so when you see these tourism boards and the governor of Florida
[01:35:02.960 --> 01:35:06.320]  standing out there and pointing at the clean water and saying see it's safe to
[01:35:06.320 --> 01:35:10.720]  swim in that's not absolutely a given you don't know that without laboratory
[01:35:10.720 --> 01:35:14.760]  tests but the bottom line is the economy of the Gulf Coast states is
[01:35:14.760 --> 01:35:18.600]  absolutely destroyed even the twenty billion dollars that they're talking
[01:35:18.600 --> 01:35:23.040]  about having for compensation claims is a drop in the bucket to deal with that
[01:35:23.040 --> 01:35:26.680]  kind of damage we're getting reports that the acclaimed centers for British
[01:35:26.680 --> 01:35:30.640]  petroleum are very hard to find and still have unlisted phone numbers
[01:35:30.640 --> 01:35:35.120]  they're just putting so many roadblocks in the way we're finding out now that
[01:35:35.120 --> 01:35:38.400]  all those people who volunteered their boats to go out and try and clean up the
[01:35:38.400 --> 01:35:42.840]  spill and the wildlife the bottoms of their fiberglass boats are being etched
[01:35:42.840 --> 01:35:46.920]  through by the corrects in this person and the oil itself there's no plans to
[01:35:46.920 --> 01:35:50.280]  compensate these boat owners for the loss of their boats and their livelihood
[01:35:50.280 --> 01:35:56.920]  along those issues it's just a huge disaster and BP can't handle it MSNBC
[01:35:56.920 --> 01:36:00.360]  is once again trying to bring up the idea of maybe nuking the wellhead
[01:36:00.360 --> 01:36:04.240]  nobody's really sure what effect that would have whether would really stop it
[01:36:04.240 --> 01:36:07.720]  or just make the matter that much worse you were mentioning in the last segment
[01:36:07.720 --> 01:36:12.080]  how of British petroleum is owned by the queen of England and i find it rather
[01:36:12.080 --> 01:36:15.960]  interesting she's in new york today for just five hours that's a heck of a
[01:36:15.960 --> 01:36:20.400]  flight two ways to spend just five hours in new york and i know there's an
[01:36:20.400 --> 01:36:24.040]  overt reason for her to be there to address the united nations but i kind
[01:36:24.040 --> 01:36:27.040]  of wonder if maybe she isn't talking to some of the local British petroleum
[01:36:27.040 --> 01:36:30.520]  people about how they're going to deal with this mess because i don't see any
[01:36:30.520 --> 01:36:34.080]  way that they've got to stop at the well casing is destroyed the drill pipe is
[01:36:34.080 --> 01:36:38.160]  destroyed we know there's a subsurface blowout about a thousand feet down that's
[01:36:38.160 --> 01:36:43.120]  beginning to see pop through fissures in the ocean floor it's just it's it's
[01:36:43.120 --> 01:36:48.480]  just it's out of control i don't think they've got the resources to stop it but
[01:36:48.480 --> 01:36:52.480]  their government i mean they've got to be able to wave a magic wand and save us
[01:36:52.480 --> 01:36:57.520]  all and we saw the government not let people leave new orleans we saw the
[01:36:57.520 --> 01:37:01.480]  government not bring them food and water but come for their guns can you
[01:37:01.480 --> 01:37:05.760]  imagine what they're going to try if those hundreds of millions of gallons of
[01:37:05.760 --> 01:37:10.960]  oil starts coming into shore and we've only seen a tiny fraction of the oil
[01:37:10.960 --> 01:37:14.720]  actually hit shore and that's been devastating i mean this is going to be
[01:37:14.720 --> 01:37:19.880]  like armageddon if those hundreds of millions of gallons hit and i'm already
[01:37:19.880 --> 01:37:24.800]  seeing video footage curtain emma wrote a story about it info wars dot com troops
[01:37:24.800 --> 01:37:30.520]  patrolling florida there's troops and bp people already stomping around bossing
[01:37:30.520 --> 01:37:34.840]  floridians laying out in the sun around i mean what is having a bunch of troops
[01:37:34.840 --> 01:37:40.440]  with guns bossing people around going to do i mean this is going to be hellish
[01:37:40.440 --> 01:37:44.120]  and then the feds are such control freaks and will only give the cleanup
[01:37:44.120 --> 01:37:48.920]  contracts to be piece of city rary's so they make money off of it their hell
[01:37:48.920 --> 01:37:53.320]  bent on making money out of this crisis and so i guess just the gulf won't be
[01:37:53.320 --> 01:37:58.200]  inhabitable for four or five years until the oil rots away and by then it'll be a
[01:37:58.200 --> 01:38:01.560]  ghost town and it just won't matter because the elite doesn't care and
[01:38:01.560 --> 01:38:05.720]  will just put a new puppet in because they don't care if we throw out their
[01:38:05.720 --> 01:38:10.840]  puppets it's the corporate government that we can't ever get rid of
[01:38:10.840 --> 01:38:13.960]  well it's going to be longer than four or five years and if you go up to prince
[01:38:13.960 --> 01:38:17.080]  william sound where the exxon valdez ran aground
[01:38:17.080 --> 01:38:20.680]  uh... there's still a lot there are they cleaned off what you can see on the
[01:38:20.680 --> 01:38:23.880]  surface but if you take a hole in the uh... edge of the waterline you pick up
[01:38:23.880 --> 01:38:28.360]  some rocks it's still there and all those uh... eight of those cleanup workers
[01:38:28.360 --> 01:38:32.120]  who clean up after the exxon valdez they're all dead or and they design
[01:38:32.120 --> 01:38:35.800]  they died of these illnesses that you get from exposure to these very toxic
[01:38:35.800 --> 01:38:39.000]  chemicals and now we've got bp down there in the gulf
[01:38:39.000 --> 01:38:42.920]  telling their cleanup workers they are not allowed to wear respirators or gloves
[01:38:42.920 --> 01:38:47.400]  because it looks bad in the press cameras we've got cnn reporting
[01:38:47.400 --> 01:38:50.920]  they're being told they can get no closer than sixty five feet to any of the
[01:38:50.920 --> 01:38:54.920]  oiled wildlife or the booms or the beaches they're trying to basically
[01:38:54.920 --> 01:38:57.000]  they're more concerned about how this looks
[01:38:57.000 --> 01:39:00.680]  than by the actual damage being done to the environment and as i said before
[01:39:00.680 --> 01:39:03.880]  we're getting reports from some of our readers that british patrolling just
[01:39:03.880 --> 01:39:07.400]  shows up with a truck of sand spreads it along the beach to cover the oil
[01:39:07.400 --> 01:39:11.160]  declare it clean and then they leave and of course the next time that i mean
[01:39:11.160 --> 01:39:16.360]  mike mike that's confirmed that's why they've run off cbs cnn abc
[01:39:16.360 --> 01:39:19.880]  fox local newspapers people that live there
[01:39:19.880 --> 01:39:23.960]  because that's what they do they are coming in and dumping sand on it
[01:39:23.960 --> 01:39:28.600]  on record i mean that's on record and then i've got the press reports here
[01:39:28.600 --> 01:39:32.200]  where bp is on record with the feds and they have
[01:39:32.200 --> 01:39:36.040]  the head of the coast guard threatening federal felonies
[01:39:36.040 --> 01:39:40.520]  on anyone that videotapes them and they claim it's only
[01:39:40.520 --> 01:39:44.520]  so many hundred feet but time and time again it's reporters
[01:39:44.520 --> 01:39:50.040]  who are a quarter mile away then bp orders cops to chase them down and arrest
[01:39:50.040 --> 01:39:52.280]  them i mean i've got all the press reports and
[01:39:52.280 --> 01:39:55.880]  videos right here i mean it's just in america
[01:39:55.880 --> 01:39:59.160]  i've got anderson cooper on video announcing quote
[01:39:59.160 --> 01:40:03.080]  the first amendment is dead in america which is actually true but
[01:40:03.080 --> 01:40:07.480]  why are they just it seems like they're trying to break our will
[01:40:07.480 --> 01:40:10.760]  well i think what it is is they're afraid that if the american people were
[01:40:10.760 --> 01:40:13.560]  forced to confront the totality of the disaster
[01:40:13.560 --> 01:40:17.000]  and how badly it has affected all of us not just the people in the gulf coast
[01:40:17.000 --> 01:40:19.880]  states but it's destroying the entire economy
[01:40:19.880 --> 01:40:24.280]  it's just you know the the gulf coast fishing zones are pretty much shut down
[01:40:24.280 --> 01:40:27.720]  now it's coming up the atlantic seaboard we're going to be looking at famine
[01:40:27.720 --> 01:40:31.640]  and starvation here in the united states because we are very dependent
[01:40:31.640 --> 01:40:35.000]  on those coastal fishing waters and they're being shut down because of all
[01:40:35.000 --> 01:40:37.640]  this contamination and it's all going to come back
[01:40:37.640 --> 01:40:40.520]  the american people are so angry with the government right now
[01:40:40.520 --> 01:40:43.560]  this could be the final straw just as chair noble
[01:40:43.560 --> 01:40:47.320]  was that last big step before the collapse of the soviet union
[01:40:47.320 --> 01:40:51.880]  and uh... so they're trying to noble and that's a good point showed that
[01:40:51.880 --> 01:40:55.800]  despite all their fancy uniforms and the big red square parades
[01:40:55.800 --> 01:41:00.440]  that the government was basically weak and pathetic but only good at putting
[01:41:00.440 --> 01:41:03.960]  on a show and then now bloomberg reports 46 states
[01:41:03.960 --> 01:41:08.680]  bankrupt or on the verge of bankruptcy uh... us say today today
[01:41:08.680 --> 01:41:12.200]  expect lots of government layoffs at state local level
[01:41:12.200 --> 01:41:15.720]  i literally see more than ten articles a day
[01:41:15.720 --> 01:41:19.160]  without even looking mike and i know you see him because you're a newshound
[01:41:19.160 --> 01:41:23.560]  and where they are laying off more than half the cops
[01:41:23.560 --> 01:41:27.320]  more than half the firemen where whole counties are announcing we're never
[01:41:27.320 --> 01:41:31.320]  going to fix another pothole we're never but then meanwhile
[01:41:31.320 --> 01:41:34.600]  in one county they said well we'll have 44 cops left
[01:41:34.600 --> 01:41:38.600]  we're getting rid of more than half and the 44 that are left are only
[01:41:38.600 --> 01:41:41.240]  allowed to write tickets and raise money and run the jail
[01:41:41.240 --> 01:41:45.960]  and there'll be one deputy per shift who's actually on patrol to help you
[01:41:45.960 --> 01:41:50.040]  or three a day i mean this this is treason
[01:41:50.040 --> 01:41:53.240]  and and and how do they have these counties and cities
[01:41:53.240 --> 01:41:56.360]  under mind control where they've raised taxes
[01:41:56.360 --> 01:41:59.560]  and openly say all the money must go to interest
[01:41:59.560 --> 01:42:02.920]  to bankers because low because the central banks came in
[01:42:02.920 --> 01:42:07.320]  and sold derivatives to the cities i mean this is literally a road warrior
[01:42:07.320 --> 01:42:10.200]  scenario i saw footage last week in detroit
[01:42:10.200 --> 01:42:17.000]  of armed men with assault rifles guarding the unloading of trucks
[01:42:17.000 --> 01:42:23.560]  in in michigan at a grocery store i mean it is literally already road warrior
[01:42:23.560 --> 01:42:27.080]  in many areas i mean the southwest is collapsing
[01:42:27.080 --> 01:42:30.200]  the illegal aliens and the drug dealers know it's collapsed they're just
[01:42:30.200 --> 01:42:33.240]  taking over i mean this country is in a
[01:42:33.240 --> 01:42:37.880]  hell of a shape here and the corporate borg is saying all
[01:42:37.880 --> 01:42:41.080]  as well all as well all as well i mean we're going to
[01:42:41.080 --> 01:42:44.840]  hell in a hand basket here we certainly are i mean a story this
[01:42:44.840 --> 01:42:47.880]  last week that shocked me here on the island of oahu
[01:42:47.880 --> 01:42:51.880]  just down at the bottom of this hill that i'm living on there is a 50
[01:42:51.880 --> 01:42:55.400]  that's five zero acre campsite of homeless people
[01:42:55.400 --> 01:42:59.480]  intense thousands of people living right along the north shore of pearl
[01:42:59.480 --> 01:43:02.040]  harbor i knew we had a homeless problem i had no
[01:43:02.040 --> 01:43:05.960]  idea it was that bad it's uh... came to national attention when dog the bounty
[01:43:05.960 --> 01:43:09.160]  hunter went through there and put it all up on national tv
[01:43:09.160 --> 01:43:12.680]  and everybody is shocked to see the scale of the homeless problem
[01:43:12.680 --> 01:43:15.960]  here on the island of oahu in hawaii and it's that way
[01:43:15.960 --> 01:43:19.480]  everywhere it's just an ugly situation the country shutting down and the part
[01:43:19.480 --> 01:43:23.560]  that annoys me is barack obama could stop this overnight
[01:43:23.560 --> 01:43:26.920]  because he's got the authority to issue government issued currency
[01:43:26.920 --> 01:43:31.000]  the way abraham lincoln did the way john f kennedy did the way this country was
[01:43:31.000 --> 01:43:35.400]  started and uh... you know remove our dependency and enslavement to the
[01:43:35.400 --> 01:43:38.040]  private bank well i'm not for socialism great point
[01:43:38.040 --> 01:43:41.080]  mike i'm not for socialism but if we're going to give
[01:43:41.080 --> 01:43:44.120]  28 trillion in that month and that number seven months old
[01:43:44.120 --> 01:43:48.040]  that number is from january of this year uh... bloomberg
[01:43:48.040 --> 01:43:52.200]  if we're going to give 28 trillion to bankers uh... who who don't even deserve
[01:43:52.200 --> 01:43:55.800]  it and who are criminal i mean if they just gave everybody
[01:43:55.800 --> 01:43:59.240]  thirty thousand dollars that's basically everybody's debt is what thirty six
[01:43:59.240 --> 01:44:01.800]  thousand dollars uh... out of this bailout
[01:44:01.800 --> 01:44:05.160]  if they just gave us all thirty six thousand dollars that would actually
[01:44:05.160 --> 01:44:09.640]  supercharge the economy instead they're raising taxes
[01:44:09.640 --> 01:44:12.760]  which is like coming up to a man who's having a heart attack
[01:44:12.760 --> 01:44:16.680]  and splitting his wrist i mean it it's going to kill us
[01:44:16.680 --> 01:44:20.440]  yeah it absolutely is i mean the bottom line is if they had given that money
[01:44:20.440 --> 01:44:22.760]  that bailout and talk money the american people
[01:44:22.760 --> 01:44:25.640]  we wouldn't have a foreclosure crisis because people would be making their
[01:44:25.640 --> 01:44:28.280]  mortgage payments people would be investing in small businesses
[01:44:28.280 --> 01:44:32.200]  they'd be buying american cars everything that has gone wrong with this
[01:44:32.200 --> 01:44:35.640]  country is because the money is moving in the wrong direction
[01:44:35.640 --> 01:44:39.640]  now i'm not a socialist either but what we have right now is fascism
[01:44:39.640 --> 01:44:43.560]  which is where profits are kept private and the losses are socialized across
[01:44:43.560 --> 01:44:46.440]  all the people and that's what's going on in this country that's what all the
[01:44:46.440 --> 01:44:49.240]  tarp and the bailout it's not communism it's not
[01:44:49.240 --> 01:44:53.880]  socialism it is fascism and that's it's destroying the country
[01:44:53.880 --> 01:44:57.080]  well people better make a decision right now and we're going to phone calls
[01:44:57.080 --> 01:45:01.320]  you better make a decision this is real one is starting to unfold now is going
[01:45:01.320 --> 01:45:05.320]  to dwarf the great depression it is going to dwarf world war three
[01:45:05.320 --> 01:45:09.560]  it is going to dwarf it all the new world order is moving on every front right
[01:45:09.560 --> 01:45:18.360]  now to bring in a cascading mode of crisis after crisis
[01:45:18.360 --> 01:45:21.240]  and then they're going to manage those crises
[01:45:21.240 --> 01:45:25.320]  into greater crises and they believe it's going to catapult them into total
[01:45:25.320 --> 01:45:28.120]  control and the white house is on record saying this
[01:45:28.120 --> 01:45:32.680]  this is the order out of chaos new world order management system
[01:45:32.680 --> 01:45:37.960]  is order out of ko okay that's latin for order out of chaos
[01:45:37.960 --> 01:45:43.240]  and this is real this isn't a drill it isn't a game so all you yuppies and all
[01:45:43.240 --> 01:45:46.760]  you cops and all the bureaucrats and all the fbi agents and all
[01:45:46.760 --> 01:45:50.120]  you people out there that have been smug in the system
[01:45:50.120 --> 01:45:54.120]  and that think you're safe you are not safe you are killing the goose that lays
[01:45:54.120 --> 01:45:57.800]  the golden eggs this this system that's coming into
[01:45:57.800 --> 01:46:01.000]  fruition is hellish mike let me ask this question we're going to
[01:46:01.000 --> 01:46:06.120]  calls why do you think they've gone after two years of
[01:46:06.120 --> 01:46:09.800]  denying war and depression when by every classic indicator of a
[01:46:09.800 --> 01:46:13.640]  depression we were in one three quarters of no growth
[01:46:13.640 --> 01:46:19.160]  massive unemployment you've got inflation in products but deflation
[01:46:19.160 --> 01:46:22.680]  in main street and in what people are being paid
[01:46:22.680 --> 01:46:25.720]  and that's again unnatural even in kinsley and economics for those that
[01:46:25.720 --> 01:46:28.440]  don't know only a rig system can do that
[01:46:28.440 --> 01:46:32.280]  dowell repeats great depression pattern chart shows
[01:46:32.280 --> 01:46:36.280]  we reported this a year ago here at his cnbc here's another one
[01:46:36.280 --> 01:46:41.400]  i've got a whole stack of headlines here where all these mainstream newspapers
[01:46:41.400 --> 01:46:46.680]  are reporting here they are happy fourth of july america needs it
[01:46:46.680 --> 01:46:50.920]  the great republic is in a perilous state politically and economically
[01:46:50.920 --> 01:46:55.400]  here's london telegraph with the u.s. trapped in depression this really is
[01:46:55.400 --> 01:46:59.160]  starting to feel like 1932 ambrose evans pritchard
[01:46:59.160 --> 01:47:02.920]  you know the new york times the third depression this is just the articles that
[01:47:02.920 --> 01:47:06.840]  we're laying around here they've suddenly shifted and are admitting we're
[01:47:06.840 --> 01:47:09.800]  going into a depression so first they're denying we're even in a
[01:47:09.800 --> 01:47:13.080]  second recession we never left the first recession started
[01:47:13.080 --> 01:47:16.120]  between six to four years ago depending on how you look at it with the real
[01:47:16.120 --> 01:47:18.280]  numbers we've been in a depression for at least two
[01:47:18.280 --> 01:47:22.040]  years now they skip denying we're in a recession
[01:47:22.040 --> 01:47:25.080]  going right into depression why are they doing that
[01:47:25.080 --> 01:47:27.880]  well they've been trying to avoid the word depression because of the negative
[01:47:27.880 --> 01:47:31.480]  connotation and you need to understand that the word depression was used
[01:47:31.480 --> 01:47:35.160]  back during uh... 1929 to avoid using the word crash
[01:47:35.160 --> 01:47:38.440]  so they're always looking for a new word we don't want to call it what it was
[01:47:38.440 --> 01:47:41.480]  before because people have got negative connotations it's all about
[01:47:41.480 --> 01:47:44.680]  perception management can't call it a crash so we'll call it a depression
[01:47:44.680 --> 01:47:47.400]  don't want to call it a depression so we'll call it a recession don't want to
[01:47:47.400 --> 01:47:49.480]  call it a recession so we'll call it a shrunk
[01:47:49.480 --> 01:47:52.680]  can't call it a shrunk anymore we'll call it a fizzbin this is all about
[01:47:52.680 --> 01:47:55.400]  propagandizing the people i mean earlier today
[01:47:55.400 --> 01:47:58.840]  there was this story out there saying you know time to buy back into the stock
[01:47:58.840 --> 01:48:02.440]  market they're heading to record highs and it's an absolutely ridiculous
[01:48:02.440 --> 01:48:05.720]  statement but they're just trying to rah rah the people into thinking things are
[01:48:05.720 --> 01:48:08.120]  going to be okay give us a little more time
[01:48:08.120 --> 01:48:11.400]  don't tire and feather the politicians it's all going to work out and i think
[01:48:11.400 --> 01:48:13.400]  the american people have woken up to the fact
[01:48:13.400 --> 01:48:16.440]  that that is definitely not going to be the case because the dow is definitely
[01:48:16.440 --> 01:48:20.360]  headed back down again despite the early morning shove and rah rah
[01:48:20.360 --> 01:48:24.360]  and the bottom line is the government has created this huge credibility crisis
[01:48:24.360 --> 01:48:26.760]  where nobody is going to believe them any longer
[01:48:26.760 --> 01:48:30.360]  they're just looking for a new word a new sales pitch a new branding
[01:48:30.360 --> 01:48:33.480]  that they can put on the government to convince the people to go along with it
[01:48:33.480 --> 01:48:37.800]  a little bit longer and i think we're approaching the breaking point i know i'm
[01:48:37.800 --> 01:48:41.720]  at my breaking point and i'm glad you raised that point
[01:48:41.720 --> 01:48:46.760]  because i get emails saying how dare you say we're in a depression you're
[01:48:46.760 --> 01:48:51.160]  destroying confidence you're a trader i've been seeing that for at least four
[01:48:51.160 --> 01:48:54.200]  years and people comment in the online versions the
[01:48:54.200 --> 01:48:57.880]  obama deception fall the republic and i've seen it even on some
[01:48:57.880 --> 01:49:01.480]  financial sites guys don't listen to this guy if you do you're
[01:49:01.480 --> 01:49:05.880]  going to lose your 401k as if it's my fault when the
[01:49:05.880 --> 01:49:12.680]  washington post admits it's 600 trillion conservatively in made-up derivatives
[01:49:12.680 --> 01:49:16.440]  i mean how many times is that above our 14 trillion dollar
[01:49:16.440 --> 01:49:21.800]  entire gdp every year this is a black hole where more debt is created
[01:49:21.800 --> 01:49:27.480]  than actual currency it's designed by these private banking families to take
[01:49:27.480 --> 01:49:30.120]  over our society we have their own imf world bank
[01:49:30.120 --> 01:49:33.480]  white papers admitting it and all i'm doing is stating
[01:49:33.480 --> 01:49:37.800]  that a derivatives would destroy us i said this 10 years ago an economist i
[01:49:37.800 --> 01:49:41.560]  trust laid it out it was common sense
[01:49:41.560 --> 01:49:45.320]  b all i'm doing is laying out the facts and they're saying
[01:49:45.320 --> 01:49:49.240]  though that i'm the trader mike you're the trader we're supposed to just say
[01:49:49.240 --> 01:49:53.000]  yes wall street is god raise the taxes carbon taxes
[01:49:53.000 --> 01:49:57.080]  you know taxes in big government and derivative
[01:49:57.080 --> 01:50:02.680]  counterfeit crap is the problem not us saying stop these bankers we're not the
[01:50:02.680 --> 01:50:05.480]  reason this is happening if people would have listened to us
[01:50:05.480 --> 01:50:08.680]  and ron paul this wouldn't be going on right now
[01:50:08.680 --> 01:50:12.120]  well you're absolutely true about that i mean the the major impetus
[01:50:12.120 --> 01:50:16.040]  for the war of independence in this country was to free ourselves from
[01:50:16.040 --> 01:50:19.480]  the manipulations of the bank of england and i know our schools talk about the
[01:50:19.480 --> 01:50:22.520]  t act and the stamp act but it was the currency act
[01:50:22.520 --> 01:50:26.600]  where king george the third forbade the states from printing their own currency
[01:50:26.600 --> 01:50:29.880]  and demanded that they borrow currency from the bank of england at
[01:50:29.880 --> 01:50:32.920]  interest the same situation we have in the federal reserve
[01:50:32.920 --> 01:50:36.440]  that's what produced the anger that supported the american revolution
[01:50:36.440 --> 01:50:40.520]  and we're back in the same mess we were in before the declaration of independence
[01:50:40.520 --> 01:50:45.480]  that's right i've read scores of books on the revolution and it was all about
[01:50:45.480 --> 01:50:49.960]  money manipulation all about mercantilism the globalism of their age
[01:50:49.960 --> 01:50:54.920]  all about fat cats with unfair trade advantages it was not about t and t
[01:50:54.920 --> 01:50:57.880]  taxes there was one protest that dealt with that
[01:50:57.880 --> 01:51:01.080]  the boss and tea party will be right back stay with us

[01:55:24.520 --> 01:55:29.400]  collapsing in many areas it totally lawless and the government is involved
[01:55:29.400 --> 01:55:33.400]  in treason trying to block the state from saying have we pulled

[01:55:45.720 --> 01:55:48.360]  globalism brad in california you're on the air with
[01:55:48.360 --> 01:55:52.680]  micro vero go ahead all right hello gentlemen um i have two
[01:55:52.680 --> 01:55:56.520]  questions i'll address my more important one first um
[01:55:56.520 --> 01:56:00.360]  i have been researching just recently this reverend
[01:56:00.360 --> 01:56:04.840]  james d manning's case against columbia university and obama
[01:56:04.840 --> 01:56:09.560]  and uh i can't really find that much information about although i know he won
[01:56:09.560 --> 01:56:13.160]  the case and it will be going probably to spring court shortly
[01:56:13.160 --> 01:56:17.880]  and it proved that obama is not a citizen brand that was a citizens court
[01:56:17.880 --> 01:56:20.920]  that was a citizens court which i think are good
[01:56:20.920 --> 01:56:26.840]  to to kind of illustrate issues but it but it wasn't an official court
[01:56:26.840 --> 01:56:32.200]  uh okay and then everybody's asking me about it and
[01:56:32.200 --> 01:56:36.280]  anything else brad yeah um my second thing was i was
[01:56:36.280 --> 01:56:39.880]  wondering if you guys know about uh genetically modified uh
[01:56:39.880 --> 01:56:43.320]  plants with uh vaccines and drugs in them coming out
[01:56:43.320 --> 01:56:47.320]  yeah they're called pharmacological crops and a lot of the
[01:56:47.320 --> 01:56:50.920]  gmo crops you already eat really are pharmacological crops
[01:56:50.920 --> 01:56:54.120]  they just didn't tell you and we've got all the government documents on that
[01:56:54.120 --> 01:56:57.160]  and in the upcoming film it's it's incredible thanks for the call brad
[01:56:57.160 --> 01:57:00.440]  interesting points uh micro vero your comment on manning's
[01:57:00.440 --> 01:57:06.440]  trial that he had of obama a berry sitaro and then on the gmo
[01:57:06.440 --> 01:57:10.440]  well this issue of obama's eligibility to be president i think it's a
[01:57:10.440 --> 01:57:13.240]  distraction to get people to argue back and forth about his birth
[01:57:13.240 --> 01:57:16.520]  certificate instead of looking at the real issues about
[01:57:16.520 --> 01:57:20.760]  well for me the number one issue is americans got attacked in international
[01:57:20.760 --> 01:57:24.680]  waters and obama did nothing about it and now he's making buddy buddy with net
[01:57:24.680 --> 01:57:28.120]  and yahoo i think that's far more important than the story of his
[01:57:28.120 --> 01:57:31.560]  birth certificate what do you make of turkey saying and turkey's a big ally of
[01:57:31.560 --> 01:57:35.320]  israel uh even sells them weapons uh but in fact
[01:57:35.320 --> 01:57:39.160]  vice versa turkey saying if you don't apologize for that we are
[01:57:39.160 --> 01:57:42.040]  going to break off ties with you and israel says we're not going to
[01:57:42.040 --> 01:57:45.720]  apologize i mean they could at least say okay we could have done that a little
[01:57:45.720 --> 01:57:51.080]  bit better and we'll you know i mean that's called datan but but no
[01:57:51.080 --> 01:57:54.600]  well i first of all congratulations to turkey and if
[01:57:54.600 --> 01:57:58.840]  uh you know if obama was a real president of the american people
[01:57:58.840 --> 01:58:02.120]  he should have started off this meeting with net and yahoo by saying
[01:58:02.120 --> 01:58:06.040]  item number one is an apology to america for attacking our people
[01:58:06.040 --> 01:58:09.400]  and short of such an apology the meeting is over thank you very much
[01:58:09.400 --> 01:58:12.760]  and there are no more checks being signed for israel this month
[01:58:12.760 --> 01:58:16.680]  and uh that's what should have been done but then it would come out that obama
[01:58:16.680 --> 01:58:20.680]  is a cocaine addict and is involved in other
[01:58:20.680 --> 01:58:26.360]  things with uh mafia bosses in uh chicago
[01:58:27.640 --> 01:58:30.680]  all right mike stay there mike well i'm gonna hold you over if you can do it

[02:00:41.720 --> 02:00:44.600]  going to get mike's take because he really does do a lot of research on
[02:00:44.600 --> 02:00:47.800]  this on whether or not they're going to be hitting iran

[02:00:56.840 --> 02:01:02.680]  preemptive strike on iran and on intensifying economic
[02:01:02.680 --> 02:01:05.320]  blockades of the country that are acts of war
[02:01:05.320 --> 02:01:10.200]  we'll talk about that but pastor in ohio pastor you're on the air go ahead
[02:01:10.200 --> 02:01:16.120]  okay alex hiya first of all i'd say thank you for taking on the people that
[02:01:16.120 --> 02:01:20.680]  you've been taking on as far as uh that have their products listed on your
[02:01:20.680 --> 02:01:24.280]  internet site we've been using that uh
[02:01:24.280 --> 02:01:28.680]  dumberland's thing now and not only just us but people in our church
[02:01:28.680 --> 02:01:33.160]  and i can tell you that nobody has had as much as even a common cold since last
[02:01:33.160 --> 02:01:36.840]  october other things are just awesome the other
[02:01:36.840 --> 02:01:39.960]  thing is is i've talked to you when you was interviewing
[02:01:39.960 --> 02:01:44.760]  lindsay wins and i was shared with the thing because i before i got
[02:01:44.760 --> 02:01:48.200]  called into the ministry i was a petroleum engineer i work for haliburton
[02:01:48.200 --> 02:01:51.800]  and i work for bj hughes both and they both do offshore
[02:01:51.800 --> 02:01:56.920]  cementing and everything else and i knew and i was even saying then that this
[02:01:56.920 --> 02:02:01.000]  was that oil rig uh disaster down there was not an
[02:02:01.000 --> 02:02:06.440]  accident and back in february uh before that even happened
[02:02:06.440 --> 02:02:09.720]  they haliburton when they cemented that pipe in
[02:02:09.720 --> 02:02:14.760]  they even said then that the cement job wasn't any good for plain simple reason
[02:02:14.760 --> 02:02:18.920]  they had gas pockets and oil pockets which compromised
[02:02:18.920 --> 02:02:22.680]  the pipe being cemented incorrectly well they could have
[02:02:22.680 --> 02:02:27.240]  went in and redone that but they didn't and they went ahead and drilled through
[02:02:27.240 --> 02:02:33.080]  the plug and went on down in a hurry now the other thing is is this
[02:02:33.080 --> 02:02:36.360]  i you know i even said back then the main thing is is we're going to have to
[02:02:36.360 --> 02:02:41.080]  worry about is the gas is coming out that and also said that it was like a
[02:02:41.080 --> 02:02:44.120]  reservoir sitting on top of a volcano and i still
[02:02:44.120 --> 02:02:49.080]  stick to that and the other the one thing i want to point out is
[02:02:49.080 --> 02:02:54.920]  they're keeping everybody out of that golf no pictures no flyovers no nothing
[02:02:54.920 --> 02:02:58.600]  and it just from when you just look at the situation
[02:02:58.600 --> 02:03:03.080]  as far as the what's going you know if you know anything about a little gas
[02:03:03.080 --> 02:03:08.280]  drilling and such one of the things that that can actually happen when they went
[02:03:08.280 --> 02:03:11.320]  in there and pumped that mud down there to try to
[02:03:11.320 --> 02:03:15.000]  shut that well off it went out through they busted the pipe and went and it
[02:03:15.000 --> 02:03:18.440]  went out through there and cracked the seafloor well
[02:03:18.440 --> 02:03:22.120]  i still say and i'll stand by this the next thing
[02:03:22.120 --> 02:03:27.000]  that's probably going to happen is that pipe's going to come out of the ground
[02:03:27.000 --> 02:03:30.840]  and when that pipe starts coming out of the ground there's no way of controlling
[02:03:30.840 --> 02:03:34.600]  that whatsoever no i hear you pastor i appreciate your info
[02:03:34.600 --> 02:03:37.880]  mike i mean it appears it's already for a month and a half
[02:03:37.880 --> 02:03:40.760]  it's already broken through the pipe and it's ruptured and
[02:03:40.760 --> 02:03:44.040]  they've got stuff 20 miles away coming up out of the ground
[02:03:44.040 --> 02:03:48.200]  yeah there's no question the uh... you know they used a very cheap well casing
[02:03:48.200 --> 02:03:51.960]  it's been pounded on by gravel and grit and rocks coming up out of that well
[02:03:51.960 --> 02:03:55.960]  for the last 70 plus days uh... we knew that even before the deep
[02:03:55.960 --> 02:03:59.320]  water horizon explosion the drill was bringing up
[02:03:59.320 --> 02:04:03.000]  pieces of hard rubber from the safety equipment they'd accidentally drilled
[02:04:03.000 --> 02:04:06.680]  their own safety gear that's why they knew that there was that valve about a
[02:04:06.680 --> 02:04:09.320]  thousand feet down under the floor of the Gulf of Mexico
[02:04:09.320 --> 02:04:12.600]  that was damaged and that's why the top kill operation failed
[02:04:12.600 --> 02:04:16.520]  and all they did was pump oil and mud out into the strata around the
[02:04:16.520 --> 02:04:19.800]  the well casing but the well casing is destroyed the drill pipe
[02:04:19.800 --> 02:04:23.400]  is destroyed apparently sections of it were blown out completely during the
[02:04:23.400 --> 02:04:26.600]  initial methane kick and that's another reason why they
[02:04:26.600 --> 02:04:29.800]  couldn't get the blowout preventative work is all the debris that shoved up
[02:04:29.800 --> 02:04:33.160]  inside it from down below and what happens when the gulf heats up this
[02:04:33.160 --> 02:04:37.000]  summer is it starting to do and all that methane gets released
[02:04:37.000 --> 02:04:40.200]  uh... the methane is biggest problem because if there are more of these
[02:04:40.200 --> 02:04:42.920]  methane kicks there is there are no safety systems
[02:04:42.920 --> 02:04:46.520]  whatsoever to deal with new methane explosions coming up out of that pipe
[02:04:46.520 --> 02:04:49.640]  all right well let's come back talk about that and then more calls
[02:04:49.640 --> 02:04:53.720]  and uh... we'll also talk more about iran with mike revero what really happened

[02:10:04.280 --> 02:10:09.560]  okay going back to mike revero mike i want to go to at least al
[02:10:09.560 --> 02:10:14.520]  mike tim and joe but i you got cut off by a break earlier
[02:10:14.520 --> 02:10:20.440]  finish up the point that you were trying to make about iran and where you see
[02:10:20.440 --> 02:10:23.720]  that going i mean this seems like a repeat of the exact
[02:10:23.720 --> 02:10:28.120]  propaganda we saw with iraq in the lead up to the invasion seven years ago
[02:10:28.120 --> 02:10:33.000]  they just replaced the last letter in iraq
[02:10:33.000 --> 02:10:36.760]  they removed the queue and put an end in i mean it's the same thing
[02:10:36.760 --> 02:10:41.480]  they've got nukes they've got wmds they're going to kill us uh
[02:10:41.480 --> 02:10:45.240]  and that would also be the perfect distraction for the banking takeover
[02:10:45.240 --> 02:10:49.240]  the police state the depression we see here domestically
[02:10:49.240 --> 02:10:53.000]  yeah absolutely there are a lot of people who see a major war as their best
[02:10:53.000 --> 02:10:56.840]  solution uh but right now obama the democrats are getting
[02:10:56.840 --> 02:11:00.360]  ready to run in november uh with the economy on their heads the
[02:11:00.360 --> 02:11:03.080]  inability to change it the unwillingness to change it
[02:11:03.080 --> 02:11:06.600]  uh they're definitely dealing with the aftermath of the flotilla accident
[02:11:06.600 --> 02:11:10.120]  of the full full till attack and the gulf oil accident
[02:11:10.120 --> 02:11:14.360]  uh it's all bad news and i think the conventional wisdom
[02:11:14.360 --> 02:11:18.200]  is that because the united states was able to get out of the crash of 1907 with
[02:11:18.200 --> 02:11:22.440]  world war one the crash of 1929 with world war two
[02:11:22.440 --> 02:11:26.680]  here we are in the crash of 2007 and look how many countries we've invaded
[02:11:26.680 --> 02:11:31.000]  and are getting ready to invade if we get a new war going in the korean
[02:11:31.000 --> 02:11:34.200]  peninsula by definition that's a two front war
[02:11:34.200 --> 02:11:37.720]  and that makes it a world war they're rushing this into world war three
[02:11:37.720 --> 02:11:41.480]  because they can't think of anything better to do
[02:11:41.480 --> 02:11:45.960]  well said and what really concerns me what indicates that they are planning
[02:11:45.960 --> 02:11:49.000]  to go to war not just their open statements that they are
[02:11:49.000 --> 02:11:52.680]  but what indicates that this is more than just saber rattling
[02:11:52.680 --> 02:11:56.920]  is that we see all these white house officials and republican leaders
[02:11:56.920 --> 02:12:00.920]  openly talking about arresting citizens uh because the
[02:12:00.920 --> 02:12:05.560]  the pentagon wants them arrested or us citizens being killed
[02:12:05.560 --> 02:12:09.720]  and how the list is now in the hundreds no judge no jury you're not just
[02:12:09.720 --> 02:12:12.680]  tortured you're you you're hunted down and killed
[02:12:12.680 --> 02:12:16.360]  and now the open announcements of plans to start
[02:12:16.360 --> 02:12:20.440]  censoring the internet and to start shutting down free speech i mean
[02:12:20.440 --> 02:12:24.200]  they're openly saying obama has a kill switch
[02:12:24.200 --> 02:12:28.680]  they're openly saying they want to restrict quote conspiracy theories
[02:12:28.680 --> 02:12:31.560]  which is anything that criticizes the corrupt system
[02:12:31.560 --> 02:12:35.960]  and so uh they're getting it all lined up and ready
[02:12:35.960 --> 02:12:40.280]  and people need to know again this is not a game this is really happening
[02:12:40.280 --> 02:12:43.560]  well they're already doing it with their own tsa people and i guess they kind of
[02:12:43.560 --> 02:12:48.040]  got uh tired of all their employees reading on the internet how badly tsa
[02:12:48.040 --> 02:12:51.560]  is annoying people and messing people up and certainly they destroyed tourism
[02:12:51.560 --> 02:12:55.800]  here in hawaii so already the tsa is blocking their own
[02:12:55.800 --> 02:12:59.160]  internal networks from seeing websites like yours and mine or anything
[02:12:59.160 --> 02:13:03.480]  controversial or conspiratorial so the idea is the government is now
[02:13:03.480 --> 02:13:07.560]  trying to protect their own people from seeing what's really going on with the
[02:13:07.560 --> 02:13:10.680]  country in order to try and hang on to that loyalty a little bit
[02:13:10.680 --> 02:13:14.040]  longer and we've seen this in england going back two years
[02:13:14.040 --> 02:13:18.760]  ago the government in many areas of england offers free broadband to cell
[02:13:18.760 --> 02:13:23.000]  phones and laptops and everything is converting uh is converting to that
[02:13:23.000 --> 02:13:27.240]  3g and that 4g system and info wars dot com prison
[02:13:27.240 --> 02:13:30.440]  planet dot com are blocked on the continent of europe
[02:13:30.440 --> 02:13:34.840]  in many of the quote government wi-fi systems uh they are blocked all over
[02:13:34.840 --> 02:13:38.840]  england we've listed the systems we've done screenshots of it because two of my
[02:13:38.840 --> 02:13:44.440]  writers are in london uh and they've written articles about it and uh now
[02:13:44.440 --> 02:13:47.640]  they're basically saying the fcc is saying we're gonna
[02:13:47.640 --> 02:13:52.200]  give you free broadband but anybody else who offers broadband is going to be
[02:13:52.200 --> 02:13:56.280]  under fcc control and uh we're going to block what
[02:13:56.280 --> 02:14:00.440]  sites you can see in the fcc as you know mike two weeks ago came out and
[02:14:00.440 --> 02:14:04.360]  brazenly stated this was in mainstream news this is not just us saying this
[02:14:04.360 --> 02:14:08.440]  that you're going to have software that's basically acts as a black box on
[02:14:08.440 --> 02:14:12.680]  your tv which is digital and on your computer
[02:14:12.680 --> 02:14:16.040]  that blocks what you can see so it acts as a gatekeeper
[02:14:16.040 --> 02:14:21.080]  but also surveils what you're doing i mean again even alex jones you know
[02:14:21.080 --> 02:14:26.280]  mr anti-new world order i'm shocked that we're actually at this precipice now
[02:14:26.280 --> 02:14:30.280]  that they're actually announcing it it's just brazen
[02:14:30.280 --> 02:14:36.120]  naked authoritarian anti-american stylistic crap
[02:14:36.120 --> 02:14:39.560]  well they have to announce it because everybody sees that it's happening
[02:14:39.560 --> 02:14:43.160]  what they're trying to do is convince everybody that it's for their own good
[02:14:43.160 --> 02:14:47.080]  that they really ought not to be looking at these alternative news sites because
[02:14:47.080 --> 02:14:50.440]  after all trust the government trust the corporate media
[02:14:50.440 --> 02:14:54.200]  they would never lie to you they're really fighting a losing battle here and
[02:14:54.200 --> 02:14:56.840]  again the historical perspective i like to use
[02:14:56.840 --> 02:15:00.840]  is guttenberg and his movable type printing press if you look at how the
[02:15:00.840 --> 02:15:04.360]  established power structure reacted to that you will see
[02:15:04.360 --> 02:15:08.040]  exactly the same reactions today against the blogs and the internet
[02:15:08.040 --> 02:15:13.640]  and in the long run it has to fail in fact i saw another telegraph article
[02:15:13.640 --> 02:15:18.200]  today separately i saw another u.s newspaper report that
[02:15:18.200 --> 02:15:22.600]  look the corporate media is dying the government is falling apart
[02:15:22.600 --> 02:15:26.200]  they're trying to block the internet it's not going to work i mean the minute
[02:15:26.200 --> 02:15:30.680]  they try to come in and block the drudge report and info wars
[02:15:30.680 --> 02:15:34.680]  dot com and what really happened then that just makes all of us have a form
[02:15:34.680 --> 02:15:37.960]  of solidarity and basically stick together
[02:15:37.960 --> 02:15:42.920]  and and it it radicalizes even quote more mainline
[02:15:42.920 --> 02:15:45.960]  type media like drudge report i mean look at the drudge report now
[02:15:45.960 --> 02:15:49.960]  it reads many days like prisonplanet.com i mean it is
[02:15:49.960 --> 02:15:53.400]  anti-new world order it admits the world government
[02:15:53.400 --> 02:15:56.520]  it links to all the globalists making these admissions
[02:15:56.520 --> 02:16:00.120]  it admits the globalists are trying to overthrow the country
[02:16:00.120 --> 02:16:03.800]  that they're overthrowing the internet and now i'm seeing more
[02:16:03.800 --> 02:16:09.320]  quote mainline or transitional media basically being radicalized as the
[02:16:09.320 --> 02:16:12.280]  white house would call it and just telling the truth
[02:16:12.280 --> 02:16:15.960]  and so i think i think it's too little too late
[02:16:15.960 --> 02:16:19.080]  i don't think they can put Humpty Dumpty back together again
[02:16:19.080 --> 02:16:22.360]  i absolutely agree here and we've got a saying on a coffee cup around here
[02:16:22.360 --> 02:16:25.400]  the fastest way to bring down a dictatorship is to force them to act
[02:16:25.400 --> 02:16:29.560]  like one where everybody can see it and on the day that they try and shut down
[02:16:29.560 --> 02:16:32.520]  portions of the internet to protect the american people
[02:16:32.520 --> 02:16:35.400]  i think that's going to be when the american people really wake up and
[02:16:35.400 --> 02:16:38.600]  realize we're living in the 21st century version of
[02:16:38.600 --> 02:16:42.520]  nazi germany what did you think of i don't know if you saw it you probably
[02:16:42.520 --> 02:16:46.360]  did there were a bunch of british news and uh
[02:16:46.360 --> 02:16:50.840]  european union newspapers uh that reported in the last few days we
[02:16:50.840 --> 02:16:53.160]  covered it yesterday i'm going to get back into it the next hour
[02:16:53.160 --> 02:16:56.680]  because i didn't spend enough time on it where they go oh yeah there are
[02:16:56.680 --> 02:17:00.760]  microphones everywhere in the street lamps hidden
[02:17:00.760 --> 02:17:04.440]  and we are listening to you well i remember 11 years ago then putting the
[02:17:04.440 --> 02:17:07.880]  microphones in in austin and saying that they were gunshot
[02:17:07.880 --> 02:17:12.600]  detectors but they've never used them for that and then i went and search
[02:17:12.600 --> 02:17:15.960]  engine i remember it was like dog pile at the time in 99
[02:17:15.960 --> 02:17:19.880]  google wasn't even around i went to an altivist or whatever search
[02:17:19.880 --> 02:17:23.960]  and there was the company bragging uh that it that it's
[02:17:23.960 --> 02:17:27.480]  we can listen to people at 200 yards away and then send it through the
[02:17:27.480 --> 02:17:31.000]  software for key words and here are those very same
[02:17:31.000 --> 02:17:34.840]  companies and but the difference is now the government the media are saying
[02:17:34.840 --> 02:17:38.040]  okay we are listening to you and analyzing your
[02:17:38.040 --> 02:17:43.160]  key words i mean that is right out of 1984 where he's hiding in the woods
[02:17:43.160 --> 02:17:47.080]  having sex with his girlfriend and big brothers got the woods miked i mean
[02:17:47.080 --> 02:17:51.080]  this is this is incredible well you know i remember it wasn't
[02:17:51.080 --> 02:17:54.280]  that long ago when uh people who were saying you know they can listen to you
[02:17:54.280 --> 02:17:57.640]  over your cell phone that's the reason it's got a speakerphone mode
[02:17:57.640 --> 02:18:01.160]  is so that they can justify having a microphone that can hear the entire room
[02:18:01.160 --> 02:18:04.360]  and people are saying that's nonsense now you've got the fbi admitting that
[02:18:04.360 --> 02:18:07.880]  yeah that's built into the cell phone system they can turn on the microphone
[02:18:07.880 --> 02:18:11.560]  in your cell phone you're carrying your own tracking and listening even when
[02:18:11.560 --> 02:18:14.840]  it's off even when it's off and then people have to remove the battery
[02:18:14.840 --> 02:18:18.600]  you can't remove it with iPhones that's exactly true
[02:18:18.600 --> 02:18:21.480]  if you really want security you have to walk away from your phone
[02:18:21.480 --> 02:18:26.680]  or you have to put it in a a box that blocks all radio signals
[02:18:26.680 --> 02:18:30.040]  by the way we do have a sponsor that has those led shielding and then
[02:18:30.040 --> 02:18:33.080]  that's the way to go because if you've got your cell phone by electrical
[02:18:33.080 --> 02:18:37.240]  equipment every minute or two you hear a beep through your speaker system
[02:18:37.240 --> 02:18:41.400]  and we went and looked it up that is the gps system pinging it
[02:18:41.400 --> 02:18:47.480]  to check your location so they are able to basically listen to you
[02:18:47.480 --> 02:18:51.000]  possibly even watch you through the cameras it's set up to be that way
[02:18:51.000 --> 02:18:53.720]  the government is obviously terrified of the american people
[02:18:53.720 --> 02:18:56.600]  they're trying to figure out some way they can squeeze the last few pennies out
[02:18:56.600 --> 02:18:59.320]  of our pockets without triggering a revolution
[02:18:59.320 --> 02:19:03.480]  frankly my readers and i are somewhat amazed that it hasn't started yet
[02:19:03.480 --> 02:19:06.760]  but my my concern is and i want to hold you over for one more segment to take
[02:19:06.760 --> 02:19:12.040]  calls my concern is is that
[02:19:12.040 --> 02:19:14.840]  they want a revolution they want it to be violent
[02:19:14.840 --> 02:19:17.880]  because we're winning it in with the hearts and minds
[02:19:17.880 --> 02:19:21.480]  and if enough people wake up and realize just how illegitimate this system is
[02:19:21.480 --> 02:19:26.680]  it'll fall on its own that's that's my thought about this as well
[02:19:26.680 --> 02:19:31.000]  that uh the us is going to go the way of the ussr and i'm more
[02:19:31.000 --> 02:19:33.640]  more and more people are beginning to write and contemplate
[02:19:33.640 --> 02:19:36.840]  that the u.s is headed for a soviet style breakup and i do think it's
[02:19:36.840 --> 02:19:39.960]  inevitable
[02:19:39.960 --> 02:19:43.800]  my revero is our guest we'll do one more segment i'm gonna get to everybody
[02:19:43.800 --> 02:19:46.760]  uh coming up here but we're gonna go quickly your calls
[02:19:46.760 --> 02:19:50.840]  al mike tim joe john and others who are patiently listening
[02:19:50.840 --> 02:19:55.320]  this is such important information we are at a historical crossroads
[02:19:55.320 --> 02:19:59.640]  i mean the destiny of humanity to a great extent is being decided right
[02:19:59.640 --> 02:20:03.400]  down this is alex jones with five good reasons
[02:20:03.400 --> 02:20:05.880]  you should consider buying a solar power generator
[02:20:05.880 --> 02:20:09.400]  number one new climate legislation could easily double or triple your
[02:20:09.400 --> 02:20:12.280]  electric bill number two our new energies are
[02:20:12.280 --> 02:20:15.880]  wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have
[02:20:15.880 --> 02:20:20.120]  it's true total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid
[02:20:20.120 --> 02:20:23.320]  technology is coming number three in some areas of the
[02:20:23.320 --> 02:20:25.960]  country the power grid is dangerously overloaded
[02:20:25.960 --> 02:20:29.880]  and now new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem
[02:20:29.880 --> 02:20:33.400]  number four dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids
[02:20:33.400 --> 02:20:36.520]  every year thousands of families lose their power from weather-related
[02:20:36.520 --> 02:20:39.560]  onages number five a solar power generator provides
[02:20:39.560 --> 02:20:43.080]  powerful backup insurance and peace of mind folks i really believe in the
[02:20:43.080 --> 02:20:45.640]  solar power generators offered by solutions from science
[02:20:45.640 --> 02:20:48.600]  one of my oldest sponsors you can get more information at
[02:20:48.600 --> 02:20:53.080]  www.mysolarbackup.com that's mysolarbackup.com

[02:21:09.000 --> 02:21:12.440]  you wouldn't buy gold if you believed that the government is doing a great
[02:21:12.440 --> 02:21:14.520]  job that the fed will stop handing out
[02:21:14.520 --> 02:21:18.280]  trillions of dollars like bailout candy that social security would be there for
[02:21:18.280 --> 02:21:20.760]  you that's not what's happening you might even
[02:21:20.760 --> 02:21:24.600]  pass on gold if the stimulus package wouldn't fuel inflation
[02:21:24.600 --> 02:21:28.440]  or that the dollar wouldn't lose value or that your retirement would be secure
[02:21:28.440 --> 02:21:31.880]  if all looks rosy to you then now is not the time to buy gold
[02:21:31.880 --> 02:21:35.480]  for the realists there have never been more sobering reasons to diversify
[02:21:35.480 --> 02:21:39.240]  with gold since 2001 the us dollar index has tanked
[02:21:39.240 --> 02:21:43.720]  30 percent while gold has risen 300 percent right now savvy investors are
[02:21:43.720 --> 02:21:46.440]  adding gold to their portfolios you should too

[02:22:32.520 --> 02:22:36.360]  to establish an oppressive world government i believe first of all
[02:22:36.360 --> 02:22:39.560]  that we now need nothing short of a world constitution for the global
[02:22:39.560 --> 02:22:43.320]  financial system global governance with the establishment of the g20

[02:24:13.960 --> 02:24:17.480]  hey how you doing alex good sir we're trying to get to you for a couple weeks
[02:24:17.480 --> 02:24:21.000]  um got a couple of uh questions for you one
[02:24:21.000 --> 02:24:26.840]  um do you feel as though obama has been cultivated for this for the last
[02:24:26.840 --> 02:24:31.320]  25 years oh there's no doubt absolutely his
[02:24:31.320 --> 02:24:35.160]  entire family uh it was involved in foundations that are
[02:24:35.160 --> 02:24:38.440]  even above us intelligence and there's no doubt he's got
[02:24:38.440 --> 02:24:42.200]  intelligence ties and he's been groomed for this
[02:24:42.200 --> 02:24:46.200]  they try to sell him as a messianic leader but it didn't work
[02:24:46.200 --> 02:24:49.400]  but that's fine they're just as happy to destroy him
[02:24:49.400 --> 02:24:54.680]  and give us another messianic leader um michael vero what's your take on that
[02:24:54.680 --> 02:24:58.920]  yeah absolutely uh with the rare exception of people like ron paul pretty
[02:24:58.920 --> 02:25:02.280]  much everybody offered to us on the voting menu every election
[02:25:02.280 --> 02:25:06.440]  is cultivated trained groomed and manufactured from the ground up
[02:25:06.440 --> 02:25:09.960]  there are very few real genuine candidates like i said ron paul being the
[02:25:09.960 --> 02:25:12.760]  exception yeah they've been compromised so many times
[02:25:12.760 --> 02:25:17.000]  i mean this guy came from the chicago machine he was
[02:25:17.000 --> 02:25:20.840]  publicly incubated in the heart of the most hardcore
[02:25:20.840 --> 02:25:24.680]  mafia organization there with communist bombers
[02:25:24.680 --> 02:25:30.840]  and slum lords and mafia dons i mean just he is hardcore mafia
[02:25:30.840 --> 02:25:35.160]  and uh he apparently holds the record for largest political campaign
[02:25:35.160 --> 02:25:39.240]  contributions from british petroleum uh and basically
[02:25:39.240 --> 02:25:42.840]  he's absolutely not a president of the united states of america uh he has turned
[02:25:42.840 --> 02:25:46.680]  his back on the american people uh sending money all over the world
[02:25:46.680 --> 02:25:50.120]  and we've got homelessness here he's not doing any of the things that would be
[02:25:50.120 --> 02:25:53.720]  necessary to turn this economy around it's almost like they want the us to
[02:25:53.720 --> 02:25:56.280]  collapse because then they can pick up the pieces and put it in their pocket
[02:25:56.280 --> 02:26:01.480]  he's expanding wars yes color you had one other point you wanted to make
[02:26:01.480 --> 02:26:07.240]  do you guys believe that we are in crisis mode before
[02:26:07.240 --> 02:26:13.640]  these midterm elections come and do you think this man will have the audacity
[02:26:13.640 --> 02:26:19.720]  to actually suspend the elections and possibly use the southern states and the
[02:26:19.720 --> 02:26:23.400]  gulf as a as a we know they're turning it
[02:26:23.400 --> 02:26:28.120]  into a tar pit come on and do you believe that
[02:26:28.120 --> 02:26:31.560]  with with the queen coming here was she signing documents
[02:26:31.560 --> 02:26:35.560]  we're buddy buddy with china we're buddy buddy with russia
[02:26:35.560 --> 02:26:39.480]  is this the tipping point and should we start
[02:26:39.480 --> 02:26:45.240]  preparing for crisis mode in america before the elections well i'm gonna
[02:26:45.240 --> 02:26:47.800]  answer that more detail in the next segment because i'm actually getting
[02:26:47.800 --> 02:26:51.480]  into that but you should always prepare for crises because
[02:26:51.480 --> 02:26:55.080]  what government has shown us is it can't and it won't protect us
[02:26:55.080 --> 02:26:59.880]  we've got to protect ourselves but yes i see this confluence all these
[02:26:59.880 --> 02:27:04.280]  different factors coming together where i literally catch my breath
[02:27:04.280 --> 02:27:08.040]  sometimes now and am just shocked to my core
[02:27:08.040 --> 02:27:11.560]  that i can intellectually see it but also in my gut
[02:27:11.560 --> 02:27:14.680]  in my spirit i could feel the disturbance
[02:27:14.680 --> 02:27:18.280]  he's a star wars line you know the last time i felt the disturbance
[02:27:18.280 --> 02:27:22.120]  and the force was in the presence of my old master uh let's get a comment from
[02:27:22.120 --> 02:27:25.400]  mike revero on that yeah absolutely i think more and
[02:27:25.400 --> 02:27:29.080]  more people are just realizing on a gut level even if they can't analyze it
[02:27:29.080 --> 02:27:33.000]  even if they can't intellectualize it in their gut they know something
[02:27:33.000 --> 02:27:37.400]  is really changing about this country and how it's run and how it's organized
[02:27:37.400 --> 02:27:42.120]  and uh... again uh... i think it's because of shows like yours alex and
[02:27:42.120 --> 02:27:45.080]  websites like both of ours that we've panicked
[02:27:45.080 --> 02:27:48.440]  the new world orders into this last desperate push
[02:27:48.440 --> 02:27:51.880]  to try and achieve their agenda because i think left to themselves
[02:27:51.880 --> 02:27:54.680]  they would have preferred a more leisurely transition
[02:27:54.680 --> 02:27:58.040]  that didn't call as much attention to themselves but i think they realize that
[02:27:58.040 --> 02:28:01.160]  if they're not able to make it happen now that the whole thing is going to fall
[02:28:01.160 --> 02:28:05.000]  flat on their face and these guys are confident they're smart they work hard
[02:28:05.000 --> 02:28:08.040]  they've studied tyranny they admit they studied it
[02:28:08.040 --> 02:28:11.240]  and they're not accustomed to losing and they're very bold
[02:28:11.240 --> 02:28:15.160]  and so everything we do now gathering our forces
[02:28:15.160 --> 02:28:19.160]  uh illuminating these enemies exposing them as the tyrants not their
[02:28:19.160 --> 02:28:23.160]  obama puppet or their republican puppets
[02:28:23.160 --> 02:28:27.320]  that is key because the people think the battles joined right now
[02:28:27.320 --> 02:28:31.000]  they haven't seen anything yet this is only going to get crazier
[02:28:31.000 --> 02:28:35.800]  from here on out and it is every person you reach out to now
[02:28:35.800 --> 02:28:39.640]  is going to be a game changer is going to be a deciding
[02:28:39.640 --> 02:28:44.440]  element in this unfolding situation now i appreciate your call
[02:28:44.440 --> 02:28:47.960]  uh... and we'll come back and take more calls we're going to let mike go now but
[02:28:47.960 --> 02:28:52.440]  uh... mike i appreciate you joining us but do you concur with me or do you
[02:28:52.440 --> 02:28:57.800]  do you agree disagree with that uh... when you said it you can feel it in your gut
[02:28:57.800 --> 02:29:01.400]  yeah absolutely uh... where we're in a period of tremendous change
[02:29:01.400 --> 02:29:05.400]  and uh... what you said before the best thing that any of us can do is speak out
[02:29:05.400 --> 02:29:09.720]  publicly because then you give courage to other people to speak out publicly
[02:29:09.720 --> 02:29:13.880]  and the illusion that those of us who know there's a problem is a minority
[02:29:13.880 --> 02:29:17.880]  that gets destroyed and america stands up and says yeah something's gone really
[02:29:17.880 --> 02:29:21.480]  really wrong with this country yeah ron paul said it over and over again
[02:29:21.480 --> 02:29:26.760]  from studying history i concur that the danger point is when they go into their
[02:29:26.760 --> 02:29:30.280]  period of globalist takeover their artificial change
[02:29:30.280 --> 02:29:33.720]  the danger point for us is not being prepositioned
[02:29:33.720 --> 02:29:37.480]  with an alternative to defeat them and letting them
[02:29:37.480 --> 02:29:41.880]  use the crisis to bring in another level of tyranny
[02:29:41.880 --> 02:29:45.720]  so it's a danger point for them and us we've got to be in there now
[02:29:45.720 --> 02:29:49.000]  history is in a flux vortex basically right now
[02:29:49.000 --> 02:29:51.480]  mike right here in front of you thanks for joining us
[02:29:51.480 --> 02:29:55.320]  we're on the march the empires on the run

[02:30:00.600 --> 02:30:03.800]  this is alex jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a
[02:30:03.800 --> 02:30:08.120]  solar power generator number one new climate legislation could easily double
[02:30:08.120 --> 02:30:11.560]  or triple your electric bill number two our new energies are
[02:30:11.560 --> 02:30:15.160]  wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have
[02:30:15.160 --> 02:30:19.400]  it's true total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid
[02:30:19.400 --> 02:30:23.800]  technology is coming number three in some areas of the country the power grid
[02:30:23.800 --> 02:30:27.480]  is dangerously overloaded and now new socialist legislation
[02:30:27.480 --> 02:30:31.400]  is only compounding the problem number four dangerous weather is always a
[02:30:31.400 --> 02:30:34.520]  threat to local grids every year thousands of families lose
[02:30:34.520 --> 02:30:38.440]  their power from weather related onages number five a solar power generator
[02:30:38.440 --> 02:30:41.880]  provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind folks i really
[02:30:41.880 --> 02:30:45.160]  believe in the solar power generators offered by solutions from science one

[02:33:14.120 --> 02:33:16.840]  and video clips want to play next hour and break down
[02:33:16.840 --> 02:33:20.120]  first i wanted to just run through some of the headlines look at this turkey
[02:33:20.120 --> 02:33:25.320]  wants israeli apology israel rejects demand uh that's out of
[02:33:25.320 --> 02:33:31.560]  Reuters and whether you're pro-israel or anti-israel or whatever
[02:33:31.560 --> 02:33:35.560]  you know turkey had some of its citizens on board it was a turkish ship
[02:33:35.560 --> 02:33:39.480]  and they just want some kind of half-hearted face-saving apology
[02:33:39.480 --> 02:33:43.000]  to say it could have been handed a little better and israel won't do that
[02:33:43.000 --> 02:33:47.160]  very arrogant and that's a huge escalation and netanyahu of course
[02:33:47.160 --> 02:33:51.000]  met with obama today trying to push the u.s to
[02:33:51.000 --> 02:33:55.320]  to launch an attack on iran either way you slice it
[02:33:55.320 --> 02:33:58.680]  this is going to be used as a political diversion for the banking takeover that's
[02:33:58.680 --> 02:34:02.200]  happening here domestically meanwhile look at the federal government one of
[02:34:02.200 --> 02:34:06.120]  the few things the federal government is supposed to do under the constitution
[02:34:06.120 --> 02:34:08.680]  is issue the currency and credit they don't do that
[02:34:08.680 --> 02:34:12.760]  private banks do and it's protect our borders they don't do that
[02:34:12.760 --> 02:34:17.240]  illegal immigration cost the u.s 113 billion a year study finds
[02:34:17.240 --> 02:34:21.000]  that's out of fox news folks it's far worse than that

[02:34:41.320 --> 02:34:47.160]  talking about signing an executive order uh to legalize the legals and now
[02:34:47.160 --> 02:34:51.400]  white house is starting to put out some releases saying well
[02:34:51.400 --> 02:34:57.400]  we're looking at an executive order to uh basically order ice to leave people
[02:34:57.400 --> 02:35:01.640]  alone inside the u.s which is another act of treason
[02:35:01.640 --> 02:35:04.680]  there's no other country in the world that just

[02:36:20.440 --> 02:36:24.680]  allen's orders effectively bans all media print television radio internet
[02:36:24.680 --> 02:36:30.520]  bloggers and it just goes on uh and then here's singing in zanders and cooper
[02:36:30.520 --> 02:36:34.280]  reveals full media restrictions and access by coast guard
[02:36:34.280 --> 02:36:38.200]  and that video they tell you the first amendment is now dead
[02:36:38.200 --> 02:36:42.360]  they're they are just throwing this in our face here
[02:36:42.360 --> 02:36:45.960]  and now tar balls are hitting texas as of yesterday and these are
[02:36:45.960 --> 02:36:51.320]  gigantic huge tar balls uh because that oil comes out of the ground
[02:36:51.320 --> 02:36:59.000]  5000 feet under it's freezing cold down there uh and it it congeals and
[02:36:59.000 --> 02:37:01.880]  there some people are saying well tar balls are always hitting the texas
[02:37:01.880 --> 02:37:05.640]  coast i don't know the oil industry has been pretty clear clean the last decade
[02:37:05.640 --> 02:37:09.560]  i go down to the beach a lot galveston port aransas you name it you rarely see
[02:37:09.560 --> 02:37:12.280]  tar balls and these tar balls are gigantic and it
[02:37:12.280 --> 02:37:15.080]  probably did come from the oil spill but who knows
[02:37:15.080 --> 02:37:18.840]  um but don't worry to tony blair the globalist
[02:37:18.840 --> 02:37:22.760]  who killed magna carta and the british rights tony blair
[02:37:22.760 --> 02:37:26.520]  uh it has been tapped uh to take over chairman of
[02:37:26.520 --> 02:37:32.280]  crisis hit bp don't worry tony blair uh to the rescue and then we have a
[02:37:32.280 --> 02:37:35.400]  detailed article up on prisonplanet.com by
[02:37:35.400 --> 02:37:38.680]  paul watson uh despite rumors officials insist no
[02:37:38.680 --> 02:37:43.000]  gulf evacuation plan yet but what happens when 150 plus
[02:37:43.000 --> 02:37:46.600]  million gallons gets blown in by the hurricanes and we do have a cfr
[02:37:46.600 --> 02:37:50.840]  member in the washington post saying he believes 20 million will be
[02:37:50.840 --> 02:37:57.080]  evacuated uh and so uh very very serious uh situation on
[02:37:57.080 --> 02:38:00.600]  that front and then separately usa today expect
[02:38:00.600 --> 02:38:04.360]  lots of government layoffs at state local level but not federal
[02:38:04.360 --> 02:38:08.040]  their pay's going up and their numbers are growing and the police are becoming
[02:38:08.040 --> 02:38:12.760]  federalized everywhere here's cnbc down repeats
[02:38:12.760 --> 02:38:19.640]  great depression pattern uh here is another one uh
[02:38:19.640 --> 02:38:24.360]  with us trapped in depression this really is starting to feel like 1932
[02:38:24.360 --> 02:38:27.640]  london telegraph so the establishment is engineered this
[02:38:27.640 --> 02:38:30.680]  depression but now they're admitting that it's a
[02:38:30.680 --> 02:38:34.760]  depression and offering you their solutions folks you cannot
[02:38:34.760 --> 02:38:38.760]  depend on government to protect yourself with looming war with iran that
[02:38:38.760 --> 02:38:42.440]  could lead to world war three with the gulf oil coming in
[02:38:42.440 --> 02:38:46.040]  with all of this happening with the depression we're in with almost everyone
[02:38:46.040 --> 02:38:49.240]  i know being laid off or having their pay cut
[02:38:49.240 --> 02:38:54.040]  this is serious business and that's why i wanted to bring
[02:38:54.040 --> 02:38:57.160]  um the owner of the j michael stevens group
[02:38:57.160 --> 02:39:01.320]  efoodsdirect.com up for the rest of this segment
[02:39:01.320 --> 02:39:06.040]  because the time of screwing around is over you need firearms you need food

[02:39:18.760 --> 02:39:21.480]  gourmet meals they've got the you know raw
[02:39:21.480 --> 02:39:24.520]  based stuff it's everything you need one-stop shop

[02:39:32.440 --> 02:39:37.240]  want my patriot listeners to be prepared and i told you two years ago you know
[02:39:37.240 --> 02:39:42.760]  20 30 chance total depression by 2010 now i'd say 70 to 80 percent
[02:39:42.760 --> 02:39:47.000]  this is i want to say a hundred percent i mean
[02:39:47.000 --> 02:39:50.840]  this has been done by design i wanted to bring up steve shank because
[02:39:50.840 --> 02:39:54.280]  he's doing a july 4th special that runs through july 14th
[02:39:54.280 --> 02:39:59.000]  free shipping on storeable food is is a giant discount folks because shipping
[02:39:59.000 --> 02:40:02.440]  is one of the main cost because it is bulky um
[02:40:02.440 --> 02:40:07.560]  steve shank thanks for coming on with us well alex all that you've just been
[02:40:07.560 --> 02:40:11.560]  summarizing here for for your listeners is
[02:40:11.560 --> 02:40:15.320]  just way beyond the pale of what i'd ever expect
[02:40:15.320 --> 02:40:19.000]  uh... that we'd see in the united states of america but you're absolutely
[02:40:19.000 --> 02:40:24.520]  right on and as this as this whole mess develops
[02:40:24.520 --> 02:40:29.400]  it becomes more and more incumbent on every individual
[02:40:29.400 --> 02:40:32.840]  to look to their own independence and their own freedom
[02:40:32.840 --> 02:40:36.840]  and the first great dependency obviously you know you and i've talked
[02:40:36.840 --> 02:40:42.040]  about it hundreds and hundreds of times is the fact that the greatest
[02:40:42.040 --> 02:40:45.560]  dependency and the greatest step that anybody can take
[02:40:45.560 --> 02:40:49.080]  is to make sure that they've got food to get through this thing
[02:40:49.080 --> 02:40:53.560]  and now something else has just raised it's absolutely ugly head we've got
[02:40:53.560 --> 02:40:58.440]  we've got hundreds of people calling us uh... wanting to put in food for their
[02:40:58.440 --> 02:41:02.040]  evacuation because notwithstanding the fact that
[02:41:02.040 --> 02:41:04.760]  uh... we're getting news media coverage that says
[02:41:04.760 --> 02:41:09.320]  there might be one the people that are living in the middle of this thing alex
[02:41:09.320 --> 02:41:12.040]  know that they are going to have to get out
[02:41:12.040 --> 02:41:15.640]  and uh... and one of the things that was brought up by
[02:41:15.640 --> 02:41:19.000]  several of these folks and that's what prompted this
[02:41:19.000 --> 02:41:23.320]  this free shipping this ten days of free shipping and this is huge
[02:41:23.320 --> 02:41:27.240]  is the fact that people are saying you know steve
[02:41:27.240 --> 02:41:33.480]  uh... we need food to evacuate we need these these quick two week packs or
[02:41:33.480 --> 02:41:36.600]  whatever whatever that uh... we order
[02:41:36.600 --> 02:41:40.760]  and if there are mass evacuations in your area or if by a miracle
[02:41:40.760 --> 02:41:44.280]  none of this ever happens as the media starts hyping it
[02:41:44.280 --> 02:41:47.400]  then you've got food insurance you can eat but
[02:41:47.400 --> 02:41:51.320]  i mean look at the facts here hundreds of millions of gallons dumped in the
[02:41:51.320 --> 02:41:55.720]  gulf over 150 million conservatively they're not letting people clean it up
[02:41:55.720 --> 02:42:01.720]  i mean i have seen CNN admit that almost everyone over 95 percent
[02:42:01.720 --> 02:42:06.440]  of people that worked on the exxon valdez are dead the average life expectancy
[02:42:06.440 --> 02:42:11.400]  is 51 when it's over 75 uh... for somebody who isn't around
[02:42:11.400 --> 02:42:15.080]  the benzene and the heavy metals and the off gassing
[02:42:15.080 --> 02:42:18.520]  and bp won't even let their own employees wear mask
[02:42:18.520 --> 02:42:21.800]  because then they'd have to admit it was toxic and now
[02:42:21.800 --> 02:42:26.120]  they're not letting the media cover it a state of martial law
[02:42:26.120 --> 02:42:30.760]  now exist in the gulf and so i i was calling people fearmongers a month ago
[02:42:30.760 --> 02:42:34.360]  that were saying this but now i've got to say okay
[02:42:34.360 --> 02:42:37.880]  this is starting to get a lot of validity here just another reason
[02:42:37.880 --> 02:42:41.400]  for people to stop counting on the government and to get
[02:42:41.400 --> 02:42:45.320]  storable food today well the thing alex that uh...
[02:42:45.320 --> 02:42:49.800]  people aren't thinking of and this this has been brought to our attention in
[02:42:49.800 --> 02:42:53.160]  the last two weeks just uh... tremendously
[02:42:53.160 --> 02:42:56.920]  we've got people calling in and they're saying hey we need we need a small
[02:42:56.920 --> 02:43:01.240]  supply ship to where we are but we've got to get
[02:43:01.240 --> 02:43:05.960]  you know we're planning with relatives or whoever wherever we're planning to
[02:43:05.960 --> 02:43:10.200]  evacuate to uh... those people can't feed us
[02:43:10.200 --> 02:43:14.280]  and uh... if it's going to be uh... you know a couple hundred miles away or a
[02:43:14.280 --> 02:43:16.600]  couple thousand miles away doesn't matter
[02:43:16.600 --> 02:43:20.840]  what we're having uh... our double orders people are ordering a small amount
[02:43:20.840 --> 02:43:23.960]  to get them evacuated and then they're ordering for their
[02:43:23.960 --> 02:43:28.120]  destination point that that double the shipping that people have to have and
[02:43:28.120 --> 02:43:31.800]  so we we had a board meeting uh... last week
[02:43:31.800 --> 02:43:35.560]  and decided that the thing that we had to do is we got to help somehow
[02:43:35.560 --> 02:43:39.320]  now you know from from working with us before that we've got
[02:43:39.320 --> 02:43:43.720]  more of a better quality food for less money than anything else people can do
[02:43:43.720 --> 02:43:47.240]  but we have decided that for these ten days
[02:43:47.240 --> 02:43:51.560]  folks must to get in their immediate supply but the big supply that they
[02:43:51.560 --> 02:43:54.520]  need to have is that their destination location
[02:43:54.520 --> 02:43:58.760]  and that we're covering shipping to both places so steve you've been doing this
[02:43:58.760 --> 02:44:02.600]  you've been doing this for decades and decades there are people that claim
[02:44:02.600 --> 02:44:05.480]  that you know they've been around longer than you are claim that they're better
[02:44:05.480 --> 02:44:08.440]  than you but i bought from a lot of different places i did a lot of
[02:44:08.440 --> 02:44:12.040]  research you've got the best quality food the freshest
[02:44:12.040 --> 02:44:15.560]  the best prices that's why you're probably the biggest outfit in the
[02:44:15.560 --> 02:44:19.400]  country there's a lot of people selling five ten fifteen year old
[02:44:19.400 --> 02:44:24.280]  government mre's and uh... you know quite frankly that's very immoral
[02:44:24.280 --> 02:44:27.320]  i feel good promoting you i know this is fresh
[02:44:27.320 --> 02:44:32.440]  new non-gmo non-hybrid i know you've got the widest selection i know you're the
[02:44:32.440 --> 02:44:36.200]  best and just in these uncertain times
[02:44:36.200 --> 02:44:39.320]  it's a no-brainer i mean my reason for having storeable food
[02:44:39.320 --> 02:44:42.680]  and and and really increasing the amount three years ago and so
[02:44:42.680 --> 02:44:45.880]  tripling the amount of food i'd previously bought from you
[02:44:45.880 --> 02:44:49.800]  so everyone in my family has a three year supply my attic and garage just jam
[02:44:49.800 --> 02:44:54.360]  packed full of it my reason for doing that was the depression
[02:44:54.360 --> 02:44:58.280]  because i know that during the depression ninety percent of people were
[02:44:58.280 --> 02:45:03.720]  uh... rural but still major universities report that over seven million people
[02:45:03.720 --> 02:45:08.040]  in that decade starved to death or died from crime
[02:45:08.040 --> 02:45:11.720]  and if we now have ninety percent are urban ten percent rural
[02:45:11.720 --> 02:45:15.320]  only half of that ten percent that are rural are self-sufficient
[02:45:15.320 --> 02:45:21.320]  we are such a dependent industrialized post-industrial country
[02:45:21.320 --> 02:45:26.040]  that that we're going to fall apart if we ever have a depression so when i
[02:45:26.040 --> 02:45:28.920]  bought a bunch of food three years ago it was because
[02:45:28.920 --> 02:45:32.680]  i saw a twenty thirty percent chance of depression now we're seventy eighty
[02:45:32.680 --> 02:45:36.680]  percent of a total crash and and the mainstream media saying we're
[02:45:36.680 --> 02:45:39.240]  going to have one and i'm not going to be dependent
[02:45:39.240 --> 02:45:43.720]  on berry sataro aka barack obama i'm not going to be dependent on the un
[02:45:43.720 --> 02:45:47.560]  these bankers want me to be dependent on them that's why i got storeable food
[02:45:47.560 --> 02:45:50.520]  and that's why i researched it and bought from you and found that it was good so
[02:45:50.520 --> 02:45:53.880]  i went and approached you to be a sponsor and that's why you're our sponsor
[02:45:53.880 --> 02:45:56.760]  and there's a lot of other i don't want to name names but some of the same people
[02:45:56.760 --> 02:46:00.600]  that have sponsors that shell gold and a frank's three hundred and sixty bucks
[02:46:00.600 --> 02:46:03.000]  and mitis has it for two hundred and fifty
[02:46:03.000 --> 02:46:06.600]  some of those same talk show house to have food crowds that sell stuff for
[02:46:06.600 --> 02:46:10.600]  twice what you sell it for and i just want to put people in the direction
[02:46:10.600 --> 02:46:14.920]  of someone i know is good and that i trust and i have confidence in
[02:46:14.920 --> 02:46:18.120]  so steve tell folks about some of the food packages you've got
[02:46:18.120 --> 02:46:20.920]  and people have another you know ten days or so
[02:46:20.920 --> 02:46:24.360]  or nine days to take advantage of free shipping which is just an amazing
[02:46:24.360 --> 02:46:28.520]  discount well the basic units are always there
[02:46:28.520 --> 02:46:32.280]  the dehydrated foods that last you know the twenty years and
[02:46:32.280 --> 02:46:35.640]  and all of this and that people can cook from scratch
[02:46:35.640 --> 02:46:39.720]  and it virtually is the mainstay that people are putting in
[02:46:39.720 --> 02:46:44.120]  but this this new a new traversal line that we've got which are all recipes
[02:46:44.120 --> 02:46:48.280]  put together very literally the one a one-year supply of this
[02:46:48.280 --> 02:46:52.600]  new traversal that all you do is just bring water to a boil and they're all
[02:46:52.600 --> 02:46:56.120]  does all these meals are designed so a ten-year-old can prepare it
[02:46:56.120 --> 02:47:01.800]  uh... very simply a one-year supply for one adult will still fit in one cubic
[02:47:01.800 --> 02:47:05.960]  yard of space and so the fact is that
[02:47:05.960 --> 02:47:10.360]  uh... right now we've got not only the nation
[02:47:10.360 --> 02:47:13.800]  uh... struggling with what probably about
[02:47:13.800 --> 02:47:17.400]  thirty six to thirty eight percent of our population right now goes to the
[02:47:17.400 --> 02:47:20.920]  grocery store and has to decide whether they're
[02:47:20.920 --> 02:47:25.160]  going to pay their bills or buy food we've got so many people on food stamps
[02:47:25.160 --> 02:47:28.360]  that they say is something like they're coming up on sixty million
[02:47:28.360 --> 02:47:31.960]  yeah it was forty then forty five they project within another year it could be
[02:47:31.960 --> 02:47:35.000]  sixty million and of course we know the government plays down numbers
[02:47:35.000 --> 02:47:39.720]  they say unemployment has gone down from ten to nine point four
[02:47:39.720 --> 02:47:43.240]  when all the private groups say it's above twenty three percentage points
[02:47:43.240 --> 02:47:46.520]  so yeah you can't believe anything that comes out of the government but i mean
[02:47:46.520 --> 02:47:51.000]  we're talking about what twenty percent of the united states on food stamps
[02:47:51.000 --> 02:47:55.320]  i mean this is insane again ladies and gentlemen the media has been trying to
[02:47:55.320 --> 02:47:59.320]  cover it up but there are giant tent cities from texas
[02:47:59.320 --> 02:48:03.640]  uh... to uh... california out to hawaii
[02:48:03.640 --> 02:48:07.080]  ladies and gentlemen i hope you never have to use this food
[02:48:07.080 --> 02:48:09.880]  and then in five years from now this doesn't happen you can eat your
[02:48:09.880 --> 02:48:13.560]  investment and it tastes really good but unfortunately i think you're going to
[02:48:13.560 --> 02:48:17.720]  end up having to use this and and and and look it's way past time to get
[02:48:17.720 --> 02:48:20.040]  horrible food you don't want to wait until the
[02:48:20.040 --> 02:48:23.480]  the collapse is completely evident and then it's going to be hard to get food
[02:48:23.480 --> 02:48:26.920]  it's getting harder and harder with the prices going up that steve
[02:48:26.920 --> 02:48:29.000]  talked about a few years ago we're now seeing it
[02:48:29.000 --> 02:48:32.360]  with staples going up it's been hard for steve to keep prices down
[02:48:32.360 --> 02:48:36.440]  this is really a mission with steve i mean he's doing this because he believes
[02:48:36.440 --> 02:48:39.320]  in it just like i believe in what i'm doing
[02:48:39.320 --> 02:48:42.680]  steve again give folks the number and the website

[02:49:27.880 --> 02:49:32.200]  not only have food shipped to yourself if you are in danger of a possible
[02:49:32.200 --> 02:49:36.920]  evacuation but make sure that you get an evacuation route

[02:50:04.920 --> 02:50:10.280]  800-409-5633 my concern is that even if the oil doesn't blow into
[02:50:10.280 --> 02:50:13.960]  shore which it's forecast to do with the hurricane season
[02:50:13.960 --> 02:50:18.200]  starting and obama openly blocking any cleanup effort
[02:50:18.200 --> 02:50:23.720]  uh is that they'll just use it as an excuse to make people evacuate from
[02:50:23.720 --> 02:50:27.480]  areas to set that precedent i mean this is their
[02:50:27.480 --> 02:50:31.400]  mindset this is their methodology i've i've learned what they do and now we
[02:50:31.400 --> 02:50:34.360]  have these quotes from obama and immanuel about
[02:50:34.360 --> 02:50:39.960]  using crises i mean it's terrorism and and folks i believe in self-sufficiency
[02:50:39.960 --> 02:50:44.600]  i believe in rugged individualism i believe you need firearms
[02:50:44.600 --> 02:50:47.880]  i mean how many sheriffs have come out in the last year and said buy guns
[02:50:47.880 --> 02:50:51.080]  we're having to lay off more than half the sheriff's department crime is
[02:50:51.080 --> 02:50:54.520]  exploding i mean you know it's common sense buy food buy
[02:50:54.520 --> 02:50:57.160]  guns be ready this is high quality food eat food

[02:54:49.560 --> 02:54:52.280]  steve shank from the j michael stevens group

[02:55:05.880 --> 02:55:10.760]  part of the cost of food again has said on multiple orders he'll do this
[02:55:10.760 --> 02:55:17.320]  per individual 800-409-5633 or efoodsdirect.com
[02:55:17.320 --> 02:55:22.200]  you know i love the ad that steve had me cut for this a few days ago when i
[02:55:22.200 --> 02:55:24.360]  called him and i said i think this is serious
[02:55:24.360 --> 02:55:27.400]  you know i really like to you know warn people to get food he was already a
[02:55:27.400 --> 02:55:29.560]  sponsor but i said we need to really expand this
[02:55:29.560 --> 02:55:33.480]  and he said i agree with you i you know i said look this is about independence
[02:55:33.480 --> 02:55:37.160]  fourth of july's coming up and steve said yes this is how people declare their
[02:55:37.160 --> 02:55:40.760]  independence it's a lifestyle change you know it's
[02:55:40.760 --> 02:55:43.960]  not just having guns or having a garden or talking to your neighbors or
[02:55:43.960 --> 02:55:48.200]  going to your state house and speaking out it's
[02:55:48.200 --> 02:55:52.360]  it's that it's all of that together it's not being dependent on the system
[02:55:52.360 --> 02:55:55.560]  and realizing the government can't and won't take care of you
[02:55:55.560 --> 02:55:58.120]  and it's a hard thing to make the decision
[02:55:58.120 --> 02:56:01.880]  you know to face the fact that america's
[02:56:01.880 --> 02:56:06.360]  in deep trouble i mean it's it's scary but around my dinner table this is all
[02:56:06.360 --> 02:56:09.000]  we talk about i mean i believe the things i'm saying
[02:56:09.000 --> 02:56:13.000]  i was here a decade ago telling you derivatives would be sold to the counties
[02:56:13.000 --> 02:56:16.280]  and cities and states to bankrupt us because i'd seen what the same banks
[02:56:16.280 --> 02:56:19.400]  had done worldwide and now this is happening today
[02:56:19.400 --> 02:56:23.640]  this isn't a joke folks and the fact that we do have guns
[02:56:23.640 --> 02:56:26.840]  and and some of us do live on farms that's one of the few reasons they
[02:56:26.840 --> 02:56:30.520]  haven't tried to overthrow us like Cambodia but it looks like they're
[02:56:30.520 --> 02:56:34.120]  going to go ahead and try it and because some of us are self-sufficient
[02:56:34.120 --> 02:56:37.400]  because patriots are self-sufficient we've got a chance of beating these
[02:56:37.400 --> 02:56:41.240]  people now we want to keep this peaceful but this could turn into a red dawn
[02:56:41.240 --> 02:56:43.800]  scenario i mean i'm not going to lie to you folks
[02:56:43.800 --> 02:56:47.000]  i mean this government is really evil i mean it's
[02:56:47.000 --> 02:56:50.920]  it's we've seen the nazis we've seen the soviets this is it
[02:56:50.920 --> 02:56:55.400]  and you need to get ready uh steve shank i appreciate the great work you do and
[02:56:55.400 --> 02:56:58.920]  there's your support of the patriot movement for almost three decades
[02:56:58.920 --> 02:57:01.880]  and i just hope people will take advantage of this special you're offering
[02:57:01.880 --> 02:57:06.040]  them well alex there's just one thought that i'd like to leave you with
[02:57:06.040 --> 02:57:11.080]  if these potentially controlled areas if people in these potentially controlled
[02:57:11.080 --> 02:57:16.200]  areas like this oil spill area is obviously a potentially and
[02:57:16.200 --> 02:57:22.280]  in fact controlled area if these folks don't get out under their own power
[02:57:22.280 --> 02:57:26.680]  the option is just like with Katrina a gathering center
[02:57:26.680 --> 02:57:30.200]  and a gathering center this is a femicant my friend
[02:57:30.200 --> 02:57:34.440]  and so what we're offering is the means it is shipping
[02:57:34.440 --> 02:57:39.400]  usually runs anywhere between 17 and 20 percent percent of the cost of the
[02:57:39.400 --> 02:57:42.360]  food we're absorbing this we're taking it we're
[02:57:42.360 --> 02:57:47.240]  covering it in fact if people will concentrate on realizing
[02:57:47.240 --> 02:57:50.760]  what we're saying right now the facts that you've been trying to tell them
[02:57:50.760 --> 02:57:54.280]  if they don't get out of these potentially controlled areas and to
[02:57:54.280 --> 02:57:58.120]  safe havens and have their own food there their guns won't do
[02:57:58.120 --> 02:58:01.880]  any good because they'll be in those gathering centers that's what's crazy
[02:58:01.880 --> 02:58:06.520]  is they went to the high and dry safe areas and made people go to the sports
[02:58:06.520 --> 02:58:10.680]  center and then wouldn't let people walk out on the high and dry highways
[02:58:10.680 --> 02:58:13.880]  you know the point is the oil may not even come into shore it may not even be a
[02:58:13.880 --> 02:58:18.280]  crisis it probably is going to be but they could just say evacuate
[02:58:18.280 --> 02:58:22.840]  and send in troops to take your guns because it they want to dominate us they
[02:58:22.840 --> 02:58:26.120]  want to set that precedent give e-foods direct a call for free

[03:07:03.480 --> 03:07:07.480]  solar power generator number one new climate legislation could easily
[03:07:07.480 --> 03:07:11.240]  double or triple your electric bill number two our new energies are
[03:07:11.240 --> 03:07:14.840]  wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have
[03:07:14.840 --> 03:07:19.080]  it's true total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid
[03:07:19.080 --> 03:07:23.480]  technology is coming number three in some areas of the country the power grid
[03:07:23.480 --> 03:07:27.160]  is dangerously overloaded and now new socialist legislation
[03:07:27.160 --> 03:07:31.000]  is only compounding the problem number four dangerous weather is always a
[03:07:31.000 --> 03:07:34.200]  threat to local grids every year thousands of families lose
[03:07:34.200 --> 03:07:37.640]  their power from weather related onages number five a solar power

[03:08:21.240 --> 03:08:23.560]  there's also a lot of bad and we have a very
[03:08:23.560 --> 03:08:26.680]  corrupt predatory elite who admittedly is using
[03:08:26.680 --> 03:08:30.920]  scientific forms of control to manipulate humanity
[03:08:30.920 --> 03:08:35.400]  and the general public has been sucked into a malaise of sports and
[03:08:35.400 --> 03:08:39.240]  hollywood garbage distracting them from the real
[03:08:39.240 --> 03:08:43.560]  things that are happening in the world this radio broadcast is here to get the
[03:08:43.560 --> 03:08:47.160]  public to think about real issues we've got wide open

[03:08:50.760 --> 03:08:55.000]  information coming up at the bottom of the hour like the lights are going out

[03:09:10.520 --> 03:09:15.320]  let's go ahead and go back to the calls tim in michigan you're on the air
[03:09:15.320 --> 03:09:20.600]  hey alex hey buddy first i'd like to say happy belated independent state
[03:09:20.600 --> 03:09:24.760]  to one of the most prominent truthful patriots that i know
[03:09:24.760 --> 03:09:28.760]  and i really appreciate everything that you shared with me
[03:09:28.760 --> 03:09:33.400]  uh i have two one speaking point and also an article i'd like to share with
[03:09:33.400 --> 03:09:37.800]  you go it's good thank you go ahead okay let me let me get it all out here
[03:09:37.800 --> 03:09:42.680]  me and my girlfriend wanted to make the uh fourth uh kind of a special thing
[03:09:42.680 --> 03:09:49.480]  so uh we chose to uh take some uh uh um action in being advocates
[03:09:49.480 --> 03:09:53.320]  so we uh went out i uh actually made a t-shirt that
[03:09:53.320 --> 03:09:58.120]  uh resembles the american flag it simply says that uncle sam wants you to
[03:09:58.120 --> 03:10:02.360]  believe the insane idea that if you give up all your rights and freedoms they
[03:10:02.360 --> 03:10:06.920]  can't protect you your rights and your freedom are your only protection
[03:10:06.920 --> 03:10:09.800]  we each we're wearing one of those t-shirts
[03:10:09.800 --> 03:10:13.480]  then i made up a little flyer that just says we're curious about how many
[03:10:13.480 --> 03:10:17.800]  people have read the bill of rights we also are wondering how many people
[03:10:17.800 --> 03:10:22.520]  actually have a copy so i put it off about 150 so
[03:10:22.520 --> 03:10:27.080]  copies off from a uh national emergency civil liberties committee out in
[03:10:27.080 --> 03:10:31.320]  new york that is just a one page and again again that's not going to save
[03:10:31.320 --> 03:10:34.760]  the world in of itself but your act of resistance
[03:10:34.760 --> 03:10:40.600]  and your act of caring that will awaken the sleeping giant that is america
[03:10:40.600 --> 03:10:43.720]  continue i want to tell you something alex
[03:10:43.720 --> 03:10:50.200]  you would not believe how positive the response was a lot of people
[03:10:50.200 --> 03:10:54.280]  are awake alex this is working you would not believe i couldn't call it
[03:10:54.280 --> 03:10:57.640]  anything less than remarkable people were thanking us
[03:10:57.640 --> 03:11:00.360]  for being out there handing out the bill of rights
[03:11:00.360 --> 03:11:03.560]  i printed it i printed it through in triplicate
[03:11:03.560 --> 03:11:07.080]  30 of your movies and was passing them out
[03:11:07.080 --> 03:11:11.880]  with a copy of the bill of rights and uh the little the little pamphlet that we
[03:11:11.880 --> 03:11:17.640]  had also says that we feel that uh being at fourth of july that we
[03:11:17.640 --> 03:11:21.240]  think it's our civic duty to pass out the bill of rights in a related video
[03:11:21.240 --> 03:11:25.160]  that's what the fourth is about it's not about hamburgers
[03:11:25.160 --> 03:11:28.360]  and beer as much fun as that is and i did that
[03:11:28.360 --> 03:11:32.200]  and it's it's not about fireworks and and and you know going out to the lake
[03:11:32.200 --> 03:11:35.880]  or whatever we're celebrating our liberties but we're
[03:11:35.880 --> 03:11:39.640]  losing our liberties the fourth is about that bill of rights
[03:11:39.640 --> 03:11:43.080]  it is about that constitution and look it's not perfect
[03:11:43.080 --> 03:11:47.480]  but it's under attack by the globalist because it is like holy water
[03:11:47.480 --> 03:11:51.640]  to a vampire and that's why they want to eradicate it tim i said i got to move
[03:11:51.640 --> 03:11:57.160]  quick uh real fast okay um we we we brought up we brought a video
[03:11:57.160 --> 03:12:01.400]  equipment with us and we really only got one person that would really allow us
[03:12:01.400 --> 03:12:05.240]  to videotape them accepting the uh bill of rights
[03:12:05.240 --> 03:12:11.560]  in the video and uh somehow my video got screwed up anyway you should have just

[03:13:49.640 --> 03:13:54.680]  dutchland the the german financial times
[03:13:54.680 --> 03:14:00.040]  yes okay well send me the article send it to show tips and info wars dot com
[03:14:00.040 --> 03:14:04.840]  i mean it is the british empire model that's running the globe not the
[03:14:04.840 --> 03:14:08.520]  british people themselves they've just paid for it and uh
[03:14:08.520 --> 03:14:12.680]  so that's interesting information uh john and ohio thanks for holding her on
[03:14:12.680 --> 03:14:16.200]  the air yeah uh before i get to uh my point
[03:14:16.200 --> 03:14:20.280]  about how the united the united states and israel are trying to provoke an
[03:14:20.280 --> 03:14:23.880]  attack against uh iran a country that has zero nuclear
[03:14:23.880 --> 03:14:27.240]  weapons by these two countries that have thousands now wait a minute they said
[03:14:27.240 --> 03:14:32.200]  Saddam had them it must be true yeah that's the kind of uh lies that you'll
[03:14:32.200 --> 03:14:35.800]  fool me once fool me twice so you can fool me a hundred times i guess with some
[03:14:35.800 --> 03:14:39.960]  people in this country with the same lies exact same lies but before i get to
[03:14:39.960 --> 03:14:43.640]  that i was fun to be scared of brown people and
[03:14:43.640 --> 03:14:49.480]  well it uh okay i'll get straight to that because i think that uh the the real
[03:14:49.480 --> 03:14:53.640]  key here is is israel and the whitewash and the influence that is real has
[03:14:53.640 --> 03:14:57.080]  within the media within the government to senate the congress through both
[03:14:57.080 --> 03:15:01.400]  republican and democratic administrations dual dual citizens agents of israel
[03:15:01.400 --> 03:15:05.800]  like ron emmanuel richard pearl will fall within the bush administration
[03:15:05.800 --> 03:15:09.880]  you have i think the uh military industrial complex of the united states
[03:15:09.880 --> 03:15:14.840]  which is the vicious uh dog and then you've got israel which is the rabbit
[03:15:14.840 --> 03:15:19.320]  dog and i think that rabbit dog has gained so much ability to infect our
[03:15:19.320 --> 03:15:23.320]  own already inclined to warmongers within the military industrial
[03:15:23.320 --> 03:15:27.480]  complex that is really dangerous and i think that the way we've all seen dogs
[03:15:27.480 --> 03:15:31.720]  are like coyotes i've i've been deer hunting before and watch coyotes
[03:15:31.720 --> 03:15:34.920]  when they're hunting they'll yip and yapp at each other and jump around and get
[03:15:34.920 --> 03:15:37.880]  each other excited and it's kind of like you can tell your dog won't go for a
[03:15:37.880 --> 03:15:41.320]  walk won't go for a walk all right get them get them and yes they're like
[03:15:41.320 --> 03:15:45.960]  exciting each other it's a radicalization process and i believe that
[03:15:45.960 --> 03:15:50.680]  whitewashing uh israel at this time and i have a bone to pick with you
[03:15:50.680 --> 03:15:53.880]  here because uh kid goes patting on the wrist for
[03:15:53.880 --> 03:15:58.200]  uh murder murderous massacre on the high seas
[03:15:58.200 --> 03:16:03.080]  uh as i i feel you you did and bringing on and immediately afterwards after a
[03:16:03.080 --> 03:16:07.400]  lot of the michael reveral this voice in the wilderness amongst this polluted
[03:16:07.400 --> 03:16:12.120]  tsunami of pro-israeli whitewash of this massacre of these aid workers
[03:16:12.120 --> 03:16:15.880]  that you thought you had to go out and get a a zionist apologist
[03:16:15.880 --> 03:16:20.120]  the very next day and that you had to give credibility to uh this one video
[03:16:20.120 --> 03:16:23.320]  that you never give any credibility to others where you know they're foraging
[03:16:23.320 --> 03:16:26.760]  and they're editing and they're spicing which is exactly what happened with that
[03:16:26.760 --> 03:16:30.040]  israeli video and i also feel that your
[03:16:30.040 --> 03:16:35.960]  whitewash of uh uh rand paul who's a an obsequious uh uh uh brown noser of israel
[03:16:35.960 --> 03:16:39.640]  at this very dangerous time uh calling for all of these sanctions against the
[03:16:39.640 --> 03:16:43.800]  right listen listen listen john the reason you were able to get on is because
[03:16:43.800 --> 03:16:47.720]  we don't censor calls a and b i've told callers they're gonna have one minute
[03:16:47.720 --> 03:16:50.840]  everybody's getting about two or three and that's why a bunch of callers
[03:16:50.840 --> 03:16:54.040]  aren't going to get on the day uh but so it's a catch twenty two
[03:16:54.040 --> 03:16:57.960]  i've got to cut you off i'm going to get to others and i've got to cut myself off
[03:16:57.960 --> 03:17:01.400]  in in in the defense of myself so i just really won't defend myself
[03:17:01.400 --> 03:17:04.600]  i appreciate your call but you got to rant that out for two minutes
[03:17:04.600 --> 03:17:14.120]  um i had uh a former massad agent on two uh who was in the washington post
[03:17:14.120 --> 03:17:19.240]  critical of israel and i had revero on and i had another guest on critical israel
[03:17:19.240 --> 03:17:22.280]  so that was three people critical of israel
[03:17:22.280 --> 03:17:26.920]  and then one uh who was apologetic and um
[03:17:26.920 --> 03:17:30.680]  look i'm not into doing what the in crowd does
[03:17:30.680 --> 03:17:37.080]  it's very popular to blame everything on israel and demonize israel all day and
[03:17:37.080 --> 03:17:40.760]  to uh just just literally say that if you've
[03:17:40.760 --> 03:17:45.240]  got mold on your bread when you open up your cupboard israel did it
[03:17:45.240 --> 03:17:48.360]  you know like a little guy with a yamaka on it night like a gremlin
[03:17:48.360 --> 03:17:51.480]  came out and you know peed on your bread or something i'm sorry to
[03:17:51.480 --> 03:17:54.760]  you know use that analogy but i'm just sick of it
[03:17:54.760 --> 03:17:58.040]  i have seen the israel the israel bashing crowd
[03:17:58.040 --> 03:18:01.960]  if they're trying to win friends and and and and influence enemies
[03:18:01.960 --> 03:18:06.440]  they're not very good at it because they lie they exaggerate
[03:18:06.440 --> 03:18:13.080]  uh they twist and about me okay quite frankly i don't like what israel's
[03:18:13.080 --> 03:18:17.000]  doing quite frankly i don't like the israeli lobby manipulating our
[03:18:17.000 --> 03:18:19.480]  policies i don't like foreign aid to israel or anybody
[03:18:19.480 --> 03:18:23.480]  else for that matter i don't want to have war with iran
[03:18:23.480 --> 03:18:27.880]  okay i'm critical of the wars i've been critical before they started
[03:18:27.880 --> 03:18:31.640]  i'm not like the republican leadership now just now becoming anti-war because
[03:18:31.640 --> 03:18:34.600]  it's popular so i mean it's not enough that i'm
[03:18:34.600 --> 03:18:38.360]  anti-war it's not enough that i'm against attack and i ran
[03:18:38.360 --> 03:18:41.560]  i mean i you know i've got to be bobby fisher or whatever and start wearing a
[03:18:41.560 --> 03:18:45.880]  nazi armband i'm not going to do it okay i know that all
[03:18:45.880 --> 03:18:49.720]  governments are corrupt and out of control some more than others
[03:18:49.720 --> 03:18:55.320]  uh and uh i i i blame corrupt governments and global mafias
[03:18:55.320 --> 03:19:00.200]  not individuals and so you know no one's going to bully me
[03:19:00.200 --> 03:19:03.880]  and to make it my whole show about bashing israel i could care less
[03:19:03.880 --> 03:19:07.400]  if a bunch of federally financed nazis and people keeps coming out there a
[03:19:07.400 --> 03:19:11.000]  bunch of feds attack me they want to radicalize the patriot movement
[03:19:11.000 --> 03:19:14.760]  so it doesn't have a big tent so that when you talk about anti-globalism
[03:19:14.760 --> 03:19:18.600]  it's like anti-black or anti-jew i'm not going to do that
[03:19:18.600 --> 03:19:21.640]  okay i want everybody to make the decision for themselves whether they're
[03:19:21.640 --> 03:19:26.840]  for liberty or whether they're for tyranny and uh so i don't care
[03:19:26.840 --> 03:19:30.520]  how much stuff the anti-israel crowd makes up about me
[03:19:30.520 --> 03:19:35.080]  i'm going to continue to criticize israel when they do things that are wrong
[03:19:35.080 --> 03:19:37.960]  and i'm going to continue to criticize saudi arabia when they do things that
[03:19:37.960 --> 03:19:40.280]  are wrong or england or anybody else i mean
[03:19:40.280 --> 03:19:43.800]  i i a year ago i reported israel was killing palestinians to take on their
[03:19:43.800 --> 03:19:46.840]  organs and now israel's had to admit that's the
[03:19:46.840 --> 03:19:49.640]  case i got attacked when i did it because i knew it was true
[03:19:49.640 --> 03:19:52.680]  but then i go on and add other governments are killing people taking
[03:19:52.680 --> 03:19:56.120]  their organs including the u.s government and then that jew haters
[03:19:56.120 --> 03:19:59.240]  don't like that because only jews can steal organs
[03:19:59.240 --> 03:20:03.320]  only jews they say they're right back you may be arrested
[03:20:03.320 --> 03:20:07.160]  and or subject to other police action tyranny is here

[03:24:50.520 --> 03:24:56.360]  see i'm good i'm bashing israel i don't care what you think of me
[03:24:56.360 --> 03:24:59.720]  i mean i'm sick of the peer pressure to worship israel
[03:24:59.720 --> 03:25:03.080]  and i'm equally as sick of the peer pressure to attack israel
[03:25:03.080 --> 03:25:08.120]  i look at the facts and i report what it is
[03:25:08.120 --> 03:25:12.200]  okay and i try to look at both sides i mean i get email saying you've had all
[03:25:12.200 --> 03:25:15.000]  these guests on with different views on the oil spill
[03:25:15.000 --> 03:25:19.320]  that's what i do i had a bunch of different guests on with different
[03:25:19.320 --> 03:25:23.720]  perspective on the whole flu thing i mean i don't have all the answers i'm
[03:25:23.720 --> 03:25:28.680]  trying to figure this out uh it's just i want it said
[03:25:28.680 --> 03:25:34.040]  that i cover what i want to cover and it doesn't bother me when people lie
[03:25:34.040 --> 03:25:37.160]  about me and you know make stuff up and and and sit
[03:25:37.160 --> 03:25:40.760]  there and like i'm even more anti-jew than you are
[03:25:40.760 --> 03:25:43.800]  you know i think jews should all be killed you know
[03:25:43.800 --> 03:25:47.640]  some people say and are like that's not enough you know i watch these nazi groups
[03:25:47.640 --> 03:25:50.680]  and anti-israel groups i mean they're just a bunch of scum
[03:25:50.680 --> 03:25:54.680]  they all fight with each other and lie and just because you make something up
[03:25:54.680 --> 03:25:58.360]  doesn't mean it's true and most of you are led by fbi agents like hal
[03:25:58.360 --> 03:26:02.280]  turner who i told you 10 years ago was an fbi agent and turned out he was
[03:26:02.280 --> 03:26:06.440]  because i can tell he was they want to radicalize everybody they want
[03:26:06.440 --> 03:26:10.520]  to have people bashing israel and then israel gets to control its people more
[03:26:10.520 --> 03:26:15.000]  when when they get persecuted how do you think this works
[03:26:15.000 --> 03:26:18.440]  that's what the media comes out and says men and men are killing illegal aliens
[03:26:18.440 --> 03:26:22.680]  and want them all dead it's not true but then that makes the illegal aliens
[03:26:22.680 --> 03:26:27.720]  team up with the government more i mean i i understand how this stuff works
[03:26:27.720 --> 03:26:31.560]  folks i'm pretty smart and i'm surprised other people aren't smart
[03:26:31.560 --> 03:26:35.320]  and can't see how it's working i want to be able to criticize israel
[03:26:35.320 --> 03:26:39.880]  when it's doing something wrong from a credible standpoint
[03:26:39.880 --> 03:26:43.880]  not i see these nazi sides with people dressed up in
[03:26:43.880 --> 03:26:47.240]  weird jewish outfits making fun of them or they'll they'll
[03:26:47.240 --> 03:26:50.600]  they'll photoshop my head on to a fat guy's body
[03:26:50.600 --> 03:26:54.440]  next to a fat woman at a jewish wedding and say it's me and have all these big
[03:26:54.440 --> 03:26:57.960]  articles how it's the proof and i mean it just it's a joke
[03:26:57.960 --> 03:27:02.680]  it's a joke these are discredited pathetic people
[03:27:02.680 --> 03:27:06.680]  and so many weak-minded idiots get caught by that but you know what not
[03:27:06.680 --> 03:27:09.720]  everybody is going to make it not everybody's intelligent not everybody
[03:27:09.720 --> 03:27:13.800]  sophisticated and and and over driving reason i get
[03:27:13.800 --> 03:27:17.400]  attacked a lot is there's co-and-tell pro funding it there's a lot of mentally
[03:27:17.400 --> 03:27:20.280]  ill people but there's also people who are just jealous
[03:27:20.280 --> 03:27:23.800]  they're jealous they're not fighting tyranny because they really care about
[03:27:23.800 --> 03:27:27.640]  humanity and liberty and freedom they're fighting tyranny because they want to be
[03:27:27.640 --> 03:27:31.480]  leaders or hot shots and you are failures and you're not big
[03:27:31.480 --> 03:27:37.000]  shots because you want to be a big shot okay i am you know the biggest guy in
[03:27:37.000 --> 03:27:40.120]  the fight against the new world order except for ron paul but i'm a lot more
[03:27:40.120 --> 03:27:44.440]  hardcore because i can be i'm not a congressman
[03:27:44.440 --> 03:27:48.280]  because i tell it like it is i've got a real track record our predictions of
[03:27:48.280 --> 03:27:51.560]  almost all come true we've looked at history we've
[03:27:51.560 --> 03:27:54.840]  done hard work i've made 25 plus films i've produced

[03:27:58.120 --> 03:28:02.040]  we bust our butt we get a lot of work done and it's good
[03:28:02.040 --> 03:28:06.680]  i'm here saying they're putting cameras up with microphones listening to you and
[03:28:06.680 --> 03:28:10.280]  running it through nsa keyword software that's now mainstream news
[03:28:10.280 --> 03:28:14.520]  i was reading federal uh you know funding packages 11 years ago about it
[03:28:14.520 --> 03:28:19.160]  i was reading federal grants about it i told you 15 years ago they're taking
[03:28:19.160 --> 03:28:21.800]  your baby's blood at birth for a bio weapons lab
[03:28:21.800 --> 03:28:26.280]  now it's admitted i told you they're designing gmo crops to sterilize you now
[03:28:26.280 --> 03:28:29.320]  it's mainstream news i've got a fox news report here
[03:28:29.320 --> 03:28:33.320]  admitting that the chemicals and plastics are sterilizing men
[03:28:33.320 --> 03:28:37.560]  and it's by design you know i got a cnn report admitting they
[03:28:37.560 --> 03:28:40.440]  in chicken mcnuggets they put a plastic in it
[03:28:40.440 --> 03:28:44.760]  which just so happens to reduce fertility i mean you know what
[03:28:44.760 --> 03:28:48.680]  let's say i am the devil let's say i'm the worst guy in the world which i'm not
[03:28:48.680 --> 03:28:52.520]  but all of us are fallen creatures what are you going to do about poison in your
[03:28:52.520 --> 03:28:55.800]  food and water what are you going to do about world war three that i'm opposing

[03:33:44.920 --> 03:33:49.000]  let's talk to bobby lee in texas quickly bobby lee go ahead
[03:33:49.000 --> 03:33:54.200]  hi alex you know uh state of arizona they could put an end to the persecution
[03:33:54.200 --> 03:33:57.800]  threats and intimidation by the obama administration
[03:33:57.800 --> 03:34:01.400]  uh that lady over there she got more cahones than 80 percent of the men in
[03:34:01.400 --> 03:34:05.720]  this country all she has to do is get her representatives from her state
[03:34:05.720 --> 03:34:09.960]  and the adjoining border states to file um
[03:34:09.960 --> 03:34:13.640]  impeachment charges against obama for treason
[03:34:13.640 --> 03:34:17.720]  and those people who don't want to go along with it you have a perfect
[03:34:17.720 --> 03:34:21.240]  example of who you want to kick out and throw out of office
[03:34:21.240 --> 03:34:24.840]  because it would not only bring to light to the rest of the people of
[03:34:24.840 --> 03:34:28.360]  country because i speak to a lot of people i tell them what's going on
[03:34:28.360 --> 03:34:32.360]  on the border and they don't believe it the news media is blacked it all out
[03:34:32.360 --> 03:34:35.480]  this would bring it off all out in the open you know
[03:34:35.480 --> 03:34:41.240]  and um it would also give an indication of those particular representatives
[03:34:41.240 --> 03:34:45.400]  who don't give a dang about our country and want to see go down to tubes
[03:34:45.400 --> 03:34:49.240]  and you get rid of all of them
[03:34:49.240 --> 03:34:53.640]  now it's a good point in fact i'm going to shoot a youtube video today as an
[03:34:53.640 --> 03:34:57.800]  emergency release just dealing with the treason issue of his impending
[03:34:57.800 --> 03:35:01.800]  executive order and his lawsuit to try to block
[03:35:01.800 --> 03:35:06.600]  arizona from protecting itself i mean arizona 80 to 100 miles in a third of
[03:35:06.600 --> 03:35:10.120]  the state many areas are now off limits to the citizens
[03:35:10.120 --> 03:35:14.760]  i mean mexico is a failed state this isn't a game i mean for all these
[03:35:14.760 --> 03:35:19.960]  trendies and fake liberals and people out there mexico controls its borders
[03:35:19.960 --> 03:35:24.040]  every other nation does especially when you're bordering a collapsing
[03:35:24.040 --> 03:35:27.640]  third world country that's very nationalistic
[03:35:27.640 --> 03:35:31.960]  and very anti america because it's lost wars with this country
[03:35:31.960 --> 03:35:35.960]  okay i mean that's just a fact the facts are the facts
[03:35:35.960 --> 03:35:40.200]  and we've got to defend ourselves but we've got this treacherous federal
[03:35:40.200 --> 03:35:43.560]  government that's globalist and it wants global government and it wants to
[03:35:43.560 --> 03:35:47.000]  bankrupt the country because then we collapse under federal control
[03:35:47.000 --> 03:35:51.080]  it is treason uh most of the people have no idea that
[03:35:51.080 --> 03:35:54.520]  the mexican military has run an interference for the drug lords
[03:35:54.520 --> 03:35:59.240]  as far as 10 20 miles up inside with also not only the
[03:35:59.240 --> 03:36:03.160]  armored personnel carriers but the helicopters and everything else
[03:36:03.160 --> 03:36:07.720]  and mommy mommy that's all over texas news it's all over
[03:36:07.720 --> 03:36:11.560]  arizona news but it's not national news i mean that
[03:36:11.560 --> 03:36:16.360]  it is insane they have troops coming miles and miles over the border on
[03:36:16.360 --> 03:36:20.360]  major highways and actually robbing police at gunpoint and
[03:36:20.360 --> 03:36:22.760]  telling them you don't come on this road or you're dead
[03:36:22.760 --> 03:36:25.880]  we are giving up parts of our states to mexico
[03:36:25.880 --> 03:36:29.560]  and the globalist and the traders in washington love it because
[03:36:29.560 --> 03:36:33.080]  they want to bring down america as much as they want to bring down iran
[03:36:33.080 --> 03:36:37.960]  any country that's been sovereign must be destroyed i appreciate your call
[03:36:37.960 --> 03:36:42.280]  it's unbelievable uh let's go ahead and talk to uh let me see
[03:36:42.280 --> 03:36:46.440]  john in washington you're on the air john hi alex i just wanted to let you
[03:36:46.440 --> 03:36:50.120]  know i spoke with some friends of mine down on the gulf coast um i
[03:36:50.120 --> 03:36:54.520]  ran a fish camp down there in grand bay for uh some time and had a crabbing
[03:36:54.520 --> 03:36:56.920]  business i met a lot of people in the industry
[03:36:56.920 --> 03:37:01.640]  and we're still in touch i just spoke with actually two different ones one
[03:37:01.640 --> 03:37:05.960]  from grand bay they were down south and west
[03:37:05.960 --> 03:37:10.360]  of where the oil leak is they said that there are huge mats of
[03:37:10.360 --> 03:37:16.200]  floating rotting fish down there and that um occasionally bursts
[03:37:16.200 --> 03:37:20.280]  of bubbles foamy bubbles will come to the surface and that the
[03:37:20.280 --> 03:37:23.640]  gas odor is so heavy and so strong they're afraid that it's
[03:37:23.640 --> 03:37:28.840]  going to cause their boat to ignite and they finally got into the uh
[03:37:28.840 --> 03:37:33.400]  to the to the slip into the bay uh to come home
[03:37:33.400 --> 03:37:38.120]  and uh the there were there were a personnel there they didn't say if
[03:37:38.120 --> 03:37:43.320]  they were by national guard or or whatever our coast guard but they
[03:37:43.320 --> 03:37:47.240]  said that they took his thousand dollar camera he had a bunch of pictures for
[03:37:47.240 --> 03:37:51.640]  me and they took his camera from him and uh refused to return it
[03:37:51.640 --> 03:37:54.920]  well that's on record that they're vandalizing the cameras and they do
[03:37:54.920 --> 03:37:58.680]  that basically everywhere now because they've hired a bunch of thugs the
[03:37:58.680 --> 03:38:02.840]  police should be refusing i mean the captain should have said
[03:38:02.840 --> 03:38:06.280]  you know the feds don't have jurisdiction to like stop people coming on
[03:38:06.280 --> 03:38:10.600]  their boats and taking their cameras i mean it's just but see
[03:38:10.600 --> 03:38:15.080]  we're a nation of cowards now and i'm sorry it's cowardice
[03:38:15.080 --> 03:38:19.640]  that these police and people follow these dirtbag orders and
[03:38:19.640 --> 03:38:23.000]  they're going to follow other dirtbag orders but everybody that this that
[03:38:23.000 --> 03:38:26.840]  this has happened to everybody that this has happened to
[03:38:26.840 --> 03:38:30.520]  has got to go to youtube and other channels and upload their eyewitness
[03:38:30.520 --> 03:38:34.600]  reports so that there's a record because i you know i get these calls
[03:38:34.600 --> 03:38:37.880]  but i specifically want them to hear those people
[03:38:37.880 --> 03:38:41.480]  specifically who've been violated in fact write to us at show tips and info
[03:38:41.480 --> 03:38:45.800]  wars dot com got any photos video eyewitness accounts we'll try to get
[03:38:45.800 --> 03:38:48.440]  it up but don't wait for us you get it up
[03:38:48.440 --> 03:38:51.640]  and get it out there and because these people need to
[03:38:51.640 --> 03:38:55.240]  file complaints they need to contact the mainstream media
[03:38:55.240 --> 03:38:59.240]  we need to continue to expose this but you know for a month they've been denying
[03:38:59.240 --> 03:39:02.920]  they're arresting people and taking cameras and blocking media
[03:39:02.920 --> 03:39:07.320]  now they say you know what the coast guard says 10 miles inland
[03:39:07.320 --> 03:39:10.840]  basically martial law felonies if you tape us
[03:39:10.840 --> 03:39:14.920]  i mean this is tyranny this is the soviet union
[03:39:14.920 --> 03:39:19.000]  and and and and they're blocking the the uh relief
[03:39:19.000 --> 03:39:23.160]  because they want that oil to come in so they could screw up things even more
[03:39:23.160 --> 03:39:26.840]  this is a treasonous government they want to wreck america
[03:39:26.840 --> 03:39:32.040]  that's their stated u n goal and people better realize the government is a pack
[03:39:32.040 --> 03:39:35.480]  of crooks i'm and they're training their low-level dogs
[03:39:35.480 --> 03:39:39.000]  how to rape us i'm sorry go ahead well my friend said that they're
[03:39:39.000 --> 03:39:42.840]  they're uh things are so bad in their opinion
[03:39:42.840 --> 03:39:46.600]  they say it's going to be a very short period of time till uh people start to
[03:39:46.600 --> 03:39:49.800]  die they said that they know people that are really sick right now
[03:39:49.800 --> 03:39:53.640]  they're supplying up and if they can get out of the bay they're headed to
[03:39:53.640 --> 03:39:57.880]  argentina and then i called friends in orlando florida
[03:39:57.880 --> 03:40:02.680]  uh that i also know and they basically confirmed what my other friend in grand
[03:40:02.680 --> 03:40:05.720]  base said and they said that they even saw
[03:40:05.720 --> 03:40:09.080]  a couple of small whales out there floating and rotting
[03:40:09.080 --> 03:40:13.160]  no no over a month ago there's dead sperm whales all over the place and
[03:40:13.160 --> 03:40:16.680]  again i get emails from the idiot public saying there's no sperm wells in the
[03:40:16.680 --> 03:40:20.360]  gulf of mexico and i mean how dumb are people like i would just
[03:40:20.360 --> 03:40:24.600]  make that up or i mean i've seen sperm whales in the

[03:40:41.000 --> 03:40:45.080]  yeah that's i know it it's almost like a willful ignorance it's like
[03:40:45.080 --> 03:40:49.160]  if they hear the truth they rebuke it and if they hear a lie they run over and
[03:40:49.160 --> 03:40:52.600]  grab it i was down at the beach a month and a half ago
[03:40:52.600 --> 03:40:56.120]  and i and these people were sitting there mumbling and i was walking back on
[03:40:56.120 --> 03:40:59.560]  the beach at night and it had just gotten dark i've
[03:40:59.560 --> 03:41:03.560]  been jogging and i was like 15 feet from them and it was like four adults and
[03:41:03.560 --> 03:41:07.320]  four females or three adults three females and they
[03:41:07.320 --> 03:41:10.760]  saw me and they said are you trying to pick my pocket
[03:41:10.760 --> 03:41:13.640]  and i kind of laughed it's i was like 50 feet away and i said now i'm just going
[03:41:13.640 --> 03:41:17.560]  for a jogging and well you're not jogging and i guess they were kind of
[03:41:17.560 --> 03:41:20.120]  big guys they were maybe looking for trouble
[03:41:20.120 --> 03:41:25.000]  and i can tell in fact there is florida oil spill disaster threatens gulf of
[03:41:25.000 --> 03:41:28.920]  mexico's sperm whales with extinction you know there's a photo of a dead
[03:41:28.920 --> 03:41:33.400]  sperm whale well i don't show them that side issue the point is
[03:41:33.400 --> 03:41:35.880]  is that
[03:41:38.040 --> 03:41:41.880]  is that i tried to be friendly and i said yeah it was i ran down to the jetty
[03:41:41.880 --> 03:41:44.760]  you ought to check it out tomorrow there's there's there's green sea turtles

[03:41:50.760 --> 03:41:53.960]  and turtles everywhere anybody who goes there you can see it for yourself
[03:41:53.960 --> 03:41:59.480]  not for long when that oil comes in and the woman just said
[03:41:59.480 --> 03:42:05.000]  there's only dolphins in cold water there's no dolphins here
[03:42:05.000 --> 03:42:08.520]  and they sure laugh i'm going yeah and i guess they were like monkeys or
[03:42:08.520 --> 03:42:11.800]  something they were white yuppies but i mean they were like monkeys like a
[03:42:11.800 --> 03:42:16.600]  troop of of gorillas or baboons or apes or something
[03:42:16.600 --> 03:42:20.520]  and it was the fact that they were so cowardly and domesticated deep down
[03:42:20.520 --> 03:42:23.800]  inside that a man on the beach 15 feet away from a
[03:42:23.800 --> 03:42:28.040]  right at her sunset was scary and then kind of like monkeys
[03:42:28.040 --> 03:42:32.200]  because i startled them i guess they they they kind of together

[03:44:03.240 --> 03:44:07.720]  just a few things about the gulf coast i don't know if you saw the raw story
[03:44:07.720 --> 03:44:12.200]  the headline was marine biologist claims u.s coast guard involved in
[03:44:12.200 --> 03:44:17.240]  corexit spring and so that goes along with what the man from
[03:44:17.240 --> 03:44:22.440]  new orleans was saying about their spring it um that bp has purchased more than
[03:44:22.440 --> 03:44:26.600]  a third of the world supply of corexit and it's in the process of mass producing
[03:44:26.600 --> 03:44:29.960]  it in sugarland texas the other thing there was a
[03:44:29.960 --> 03:44:33.640]  guest on george norie last night the first hour earth
[03:44:33.640 --> 03:44:37.480]  changes something media but he said he's been down in
[03:44:37.480 --> 03:44:41.640]  in that area and that the people he went to the gate like twice but didn't go
[03:44:41.640 --> 03:44:47.240]  through it implying couldn't say it that people down in that area are so set up
[03:44:47.240 --> 03:44:50.440]  they are ready to explode and then the last point
[03:44:50.440 --> 03:44:53.960]  because i know you got other callers steve you're got for me foods
[03:44:53.960 --> 03:44:57.480]  my sister lives in east texas like 240 miles from
[03:44:57.480 --> 03:45:00.920]  the gulf and i said to her even if that stuff doesn't get to you
[03:45:00.920 --> 03:45:05.160]  you're gonna have people bolting when the stuff hits the fan so i sent her a
[03:45:05.160 --> 03:45:09.240]  seven-day responder hang in there alex god bless you man i appreciate you
[03:45:09.240 --> 03:45:11.960]  my reason for having storeable food is not the oil
[03:45:11.960 --> 03:45:16.520]  even though more and more it looks like it could be a big problem
[03:45:16.520 --> 03:45:21.640]  my issue is the depression i mean my issue is i'll go back to it
[03:45:21.640 --> 03:45:28.200]  90% of people were rural in the great depression now 90% are urban
[03:45:28.200 --> 03:45:32.680]  10% of our population lives on the land half of them are self-sufficient
[03:45:32.680 --> 03:45:37.160]  so out of 100 percentage points 5% are self-sufficient
[03:45:37.160 --> 03:45:42.760]  that's the university studies i've seen can you imagine
[03:45:42.760 --> 03:45:45.560]  what's going to happen i mean there's already just homeless people just all
[03:45:45.560 --> 03:45:48.520]  over the place where i live they're just and they're not the drunk or
[03:45:48.520 --> 03:45:52.120]  schizophrenic type let out of a mental institution the types you normally see
[03:45:52.120 --> 03:45:56.040]  i mean i'm starting to see a lot of people that
[03:45:56.040 --> 03:45:59.320]  makes me angry i just
[03:46:02.760 --> 03:46:07.800]  makes me angry let's go ahead and talk to matt in new york matt go ahead
[03:46:07.800 --> 03:46:11.080]  alex map from mobilize the people in new york i have a few points i'll hit them
[03:46:11.080 --> 03:46:14.760]  real fast the bottom line here is the bankers and corrupt officials who
[03:46:14.760 --> 03:46:18.440]  engineered this massive collapse treat what they're doing as a business
[03:46:18.440 --> 03:46:22.200]  and it's business as usual for them we need to start treating freedom
[03:46:22.200 --> 03:46:25.720]  as a business and create a business and action plan to fund promote and
[03:46:25.720 --> 03:46:29.880]  sustain freedom we need to really stop funding 401k
[03:46:29.880 --> 03:46:33.880]  is a retirement plan they're going to be stolen by the bankers anyway oh i agree
[03:46:33.880 --> 03:46:36.680]  absolutely yeah these investments are funding
[03:46:36.680 --> 03:46:40.520]  tyranny people have been saying that for over 10 years and being laughed at
[03:46:40.520 --> 03:46:44.120]  i told people the bankers are going to take your pensions the same banks that
[03:46:44.120 --> 03:46:46.760]  run america have done this in every other country
[03:46:46.760 --> 03:46:49.800]  and the yuppies would just laugh at me because they just
[03:46:49.800 --> 03:46:53.160]  they just are born to lose they're born to get hurt they love being
[03:46:53.160 --> 03:46:56.360]  scammed i don't understand they love it their religion
[03:46:56.360 --> 03:47:01.960]  is being loser suckers oh absolutely we need to fund the business of freedom
[03:47:01.960 --> 03:47:04.680]  with a massive and ongoing fund raising campaign
[03:47:04.680 --> 03:47:07.480]  via something that's sort of an action committee that builds a stream of
[03:47:07.480 --> 03:47:11.720]  recurrent contributions on a weekly monthly and annual basis to fund that
[03:47:11.720 --> 03:47:14.440]  freedom um so you know this way freedom is fully
[03:47:14.440 --> 03:47:17.320]  restored and uh you know we're working on a plan to mobilize the people
[03:47:17.320 --> 03:47:21.000]  to create uh you know a business tell me about your plan man
[03:47:21.000 --> 03:47:24.840]  well you know what it comes down to is uh you know what we need to do is we
[03:47:24.840 --> 03:47:28.840]  need to start uh creating a fundraiser an ongoing one you know the
[03:47:28.840 --> 03:47:31.800]  the stuff you've been doing is great with the uh the money bombs and the
[03:47:31.800 --> 03:47:36.120]  short-term blast but what we need to do is we need to get people to buy into
[03:47:36.120 --> 03:47:40.520]  freedom just as they do their phony 401ks and their investment plan no no i
[03:47:40.520 --> 03:47:44.360]  agree people have to invest and put in their time in if you won't go knock on
[03:47:44.360 --> 03:47:47.960]  20 doors tonight to warn about the new world order and get past feeling
[03:47:47.960 --> 03:47:50.600]  weird what are you going to do is the tyranny gets worse
[03:47:50.600 --> 03:47:53.720]  it's the fact that we won't get in the streets it's the fact that we won't get
[03:47:53.720 --> 03:47:56.360]  in the state houses and we won't get aggressive
[03:47:56.360 --> 03:47:59.720]  and we won't call into all the talk shows and put out newsletters and
[03:47:59.720 --> 03:48:03.560]  every person doing their little bit is the reason we've got the globalists
[03:48:03.560 --> 03:48:07.080]  coming down on us now people are getting moving so the government's
[03:48:07.080 --> 03:48:11.080]  trying to come in to censor the internet we've got to have plan b for that i

[03:48:26.200 --> 03:48:31.640]  heraldo and his characterization of the g20 protesters
[03:48:31.640 --> 03:48:36.360]  i didn't see andrew napolitano talk to heraldo uh what did he say
[03:48:36.360 --> 03:48:42.200]  uh it was just a real rough piece i thought you should check it out um
[03:48:42.200 --> 03:48:45.720]  he kind of let her all off the hook never pin her all the time on his uh
[03:48:45.720 --> 03:48:49.560]  interview with the marines and then he was saying that the g20 protesters were
[03:48:49.560 --> 03:48:53.960]  uh that that they were wrong because these were these
[03:48:53.960 --> 03:48:58.040]  were crazies that were looking for more government handouts
[03:48:58.040 --> 03:49:02.520]  well there were a bunch of socialists and communists and the media only pointed
[03:49:02.520 --> 03:49:07.080]  their cameras at them so i haven't seen what napolitano said so i can't speak
[03:49:07.080 --> 03:49:10.200]  to it i just know he's the best thing on fox
[03:49:10.200 --> 03:49:13.800]  uh but uh yeah no send me that clip i'd like to see it
[03:49:13.800 --> 03:49:17.640]  okay thank you god bless you thank you thank you sir
[03:49:17.640 --> 03:49:22.120]  um you know i said i get to all this news and then here i am taking your calls
[03:49:22.120 --> 03:49:25.400]  that's it for calls i'm sorry i've got to at least hit the headlines at the end
[03:49:25.400 --> 03:49:29.560]  of this segment the next but uh marty and michael and michelle
[03:49:29.560 --> 03:49:33.800]  and others call me back tomorrow 11 a.m central 12 noon eastern
[03:49:33.800 --> 03:49:37.720]  and we'll discuss it i mean here's just some of the headlines i've got
[03:49:37.720 --> 03:49:41.800]  look at this fox news report now people say well that's fox news
[03:49:41.800 --> 03:49:45.880]  when i read a mainstream article i can judge whether it's true or not
[03:49:45.880 --> 03:49:49.720]  because i already have the base background knowledge
[03:49:49.720 --> 03:49:53.080]  and so the media more and more i mean i was watching fox news last week and they
[03:49:53.080 --> 03:49:59.160]  were admitting that uh prozac causes heart disease and heart attacks and
[03:49:59.160 --> 03:50:03.560]  cardiovascular problems and brain damage now they knew that in 1981
[03:50:03.560 --> 03:50:07.720]  during the trials so i already knew when i was watching fox news last week
[03:50:07.720 --> 03:50:11.800]  that what they were saying was true but the question is why are they saying it
[03:50:11.800 --> 03:50:15.400]  because the mainstream media has lost all credibility
[03:50:15.400 --> 03:50:19.240]  and the mainstream media just to stay in the game
[03:50:19.240 --> 03:50:23.720]  to even be relevant has to admit all this now
[03:50:23.720 --> 03:50:27.080]  i mean i knew 10 years ago just like you knew many of you longer
[03:50:27.080 --> 03:50:31.640]  that globally they standardized and government would subsidize and all
[03:50:31.640 --> 03:50:35.960]  companies would subsidize of thousands of different formulas of plastic
[03:50:35.960 --> 03:50:39.880]  the one formula that leeches an estrogen mimicar
[03:50:39.880 --> 03:50:44.040]  that sterilizes men and here's fox news
[03:50:44.040 --> 03:50:47.640]  admitting in this article deadly chemical found in baby bottles ban in
[03:50:47.640 --> 03:50:50.600]  maryland later in the article they admit it's reducing men's
[03:50:50.600 --> 03:50:55.160]  fertility this is part of a un slash eugenics program i have
[03:50:55.160 --> 03:50:58.600]  the documents but i mean it's now admitted
[03:50:58.600 --> 03:51:02.840]  this is amazing stay with us the question is
[03:51:02.840 --> 03:51:06.840]  where should the american people draw their line in the sand
[03:51:06.840 --> 03:51:11.960]  what have we got a republic or a monarchy a republic is based on a
[03:51:11.960 --> 03:51:16.200]  constitution which protects minority rights not democracy not mob rule
[03:51:16.200 --> 03:51:19.240]  two wolves and a sheep voting on what's for dinner so they think they own our
[03:51:19.240 --> 03:51:22.040]  land they think they're on our water children our
[03:51:22.040 --> 03:51:26.040]  education our money we have to define who we are
[03:51:26.040 --> 03:51:30.280]  and what we will tolerate somebody's gonna ask you what you did
[03:51:30.280 --> 03:51:35.240]  during the patriot uprising we have the facts we have the constitution we have
[03:51:35.240 --> 03:51:39.240]  the bill of rights we have common law knowledge is power ladies and gentlemen

[03:54:12.600 --> 03:54:17.880]  in plastics particularly two two different subtypes
[03:54:17.880 --> 03:54:22.520]  are sterilizing and feminizing men and hyperfeminizing women
[03:54:22.520 --> 03:54:26.040]  and are really linked to breast cancer sterility

[03:54:39.320 --> 03:54:46.440]  after a deadly chemical oh i mean and it's only serious articles where the
[03:54:46.440 --> 03:54:49.400]  media makes a joke out of it it's not just Fox that does this
[03:54:49.400 --> 03:54:53.160]  men around the world were delighted to have a new excuse to avoid shopping
[03:54:53.160 --> 03:54:59.080]  after a deadly chemical oh a deadly chemical oh it's so funny
[03:54:59.080 --> 03:55:09.880]  in printed receipts was linked to impotency oh so the the the ink
[03:55:09.880 --> 03:55:14.600]  that you're handling is sterilizing you see it's just it's just everywhere
[03:55:14.600 --> 03:55:18.040]  but it's more serious side effects were highlighted Thursday
[03:55:18.040 --> 03:55:21.160]  as a ban on the substance came into effect in Maryland
[03:55:21.160 --> 03:55:25.720]  Maryland was the fourth u.s state to ban the chemical buys phenol a
[03:55:25.720 --> 03:55:30.040]  commonly known as bpa which was linked to early puberty

[03:55:36.280 --> 03:55:40.360]  medical issues i mean i i've been talking about this for
[03:55:40.360 --> 03:55:43.960]  15 years since i got on here and i get emails every time i do go and shut up

[03:55:47.880 --> 03:55:52.280]  messing your kids up you you like just laughing at me when i have scientists on
[03:55:52.280 --> 03:55:55.400]  you think it's funny that the eight major food crops
[03:55:55.400 --> 03:55:58.920]  soybeans corn the list goes on that are filler foods
[03:55:58.920 --> 03:56:02.520]  are designed to sterilize your butt and give your butt cancer in all the major
[03:56:02.520 --> 03:56:05.880]  studies those are pharmacological crops that wasn't
[03:56:05.880 --> 03:56:09.640]  done on accident and now they're coming out with hundreds of crops
[03:56:09.640 --> 03:56:13.960]  from beets to sugar peas to everything
[03:56:13.960 --> 03:56:19.000]  all the man over a hundred you won't be able to escape it

[03:56:52.280 --> 03:56:55.880]  60 70 80 years ago right through to today where they talk about
[03:56:55.880 --> 03:56:59.480]  we're going to add stuff to the water that cumulatively sterilizes and reduces
[03:56:59.480 --> 03:57:02.680]  life expectancy well we'll be able to hide it by
[03:57:02.680 --> 03:57:06.040]  you know not teaching it in the medical schools but it's key that our people
[03:57:06.040 --> 03:57:09.800]  be in the top positions over to those institutions and i'm reading this stuff
[03:57:09.800 --> 03:57:12.520]  and i'm making films showing you the documents and
[03:57:12.520 --> 03:57:17.800]  you in documents about it i mean and i i got to have goon heads stupid cops

[03:57:46.280 --> 03:57:49.960]  and the water bottles you buy is lined with it and if you try to not drink that
[03:57:49.960 --> 03:57:54.200]  and drink tap water they're putting hundreds of deadly chemicals in that
[03:57:54.200 --> 03:57:58.760]  by design don't you understand don't you get it
[03:57:58.760 --> 03:58:02.440]  don't you understand this is we're all in this together
[03:58:02.440 --> 03:58:06.440]  this is only a few thousand scientists that are aware of all this information
[03:58:06.440 --> 03:58:10.680]  who are consciously supporting it the rest of us simply have to
[03:58:10.680 --> 03:58:15.320]  face up to how bad it is and get conscious about it and then get focused to
[03:58:15.320 --> 03:58:18.200]  remove it and we're having a lot of successes and they're getting really
[03:58:18.200 --> 03:58:21.160]  mad that's why bill gates is coming out with mosquitoes
[03:58:21.160 --> 03:58:25.640]  that are loaded with viruses that bite you uh with fake pollen that's released
[03:58:25.640 --> 03:58:30.120]  from aircraft that has vaccines that go through the skin and the nasal cavity
[03:58:30.120 --> 03:58:33.720]  everything they're doing is about covertly hitting you and hitting you
[03:58:33.720 --> 03:58:37.160]  hard and these little smiley face devils think you're too stupid to wake up and
[03:58:37.160 --> 03:58:39.560]  fight them the choice is up to you great job crew
