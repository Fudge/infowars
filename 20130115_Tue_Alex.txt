[00:00.000 --> 00:12.000]  Big Brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups. You want answers? Well, so does
[00:12.000 --> 00:20.720]  he. He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network. And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:20.720 --> 00:47.560]  Ladies and gentlemen, we are so busy, I literally just slid into the chair here. I was busy
[00:47.560 --> 00:52.560]  in there in the other office watching a two-minute excerpt of the Obama phone lady from the show
[00:52.560 --> 00:57.360]  yesterday. You can't go to mfullwars.com. We're rebooting the site right now, but it
[00:57.360 --> 01:00.640]  is linked on drugsreport.com, halfway down the right-hand side.
[01:00.640 --> 01:05.400]  Nice little excerpt of the Obama phone lady here in town with us yesterday. We need to
[01:05.400 --> 01:09.920]  go through all the interviews that she did and kind of boil it down, because the average
[01:09.920 --> 01:14.240]  person can't watch an hour and a half of it. I'm glad somebody on YouTube got a clip out.
[01:14.240 --> 01:19.360]  We need to get the clips from her on the TV show last night, cuz she was so nervous in
[01:19.360 --> 01:29.120]  here in studio with us yesterday. She was so incredibly nervous that she, it was kind
[01:29.120 --> 01:34.920]  of subdued. But when she got on the TV show, she really talked about a lot of important
[01:34.920 --> 01:38.360]  issues and we played the clips of Obama lying to folks.
[01:38.360 --> 01:43.360]  So that certainly woke her up as an example of what we can do for others. Okay, here's
[01:43.360 --> 01:51.200]  the deal. The news that we've got is so incredible that words really can't even describe how
[01:51.200 --> 01:59.720]  serious our situation is right now. But I will do the best job I can when we come back
[01:59.720 --> 02:05.800]  from break and I'm kind of officially kick off the broadcast today to go over all of
[02:05.800 --> 02:08.000]  this.
[02:08.000 --> 02:15.960]  This is so amazing when I'm looking at Joe Biden, White House eyeing 19 executive actions
[02:15.960 --> 02:24.840]  on guns. Politico, CBS News, New York Assembly Speaker Silver, we are going to ban assault
[02:24.840 --> 02:29.040]  weapons, period. And the governor said, first they make you come in and register them, then
[02:29.040 --> 02:31.200]  they'll order them, hand it in.
[02:31.200 --> 02:39.000]  And that is what the bill says. It's now passed the Senate in the New York legislature and
[02:39.000 --> 02:45.000]  it's going to the full house. So we are in deep trouble, ladies and gentlemen. By decree
[02:45.000 --> 02:49.120]  of the king, there are some steps that we can take that don't require legislation. That's
[02:49.120 --> 02:53.160]  a video clip of Obama in his press conference yesterday.
[02:53.160 --> 02:57.480]  Rahm Emanuel, we played this clip yesterday, says take American people out of the Second
[02:57.480 --> 03:02.680]  Amendment debate. We have that that's gonna be coming up. I'm gonna play all these clips
[03:02.680 --> 03:06.440]  coming up in the next segment.
[03:06.440 --> 03:10.360]  And New York's also preparing to put gun owners in mental hospitals. I mean, you just can't
[03:10.360 --> 03:15.520]  make up the magnitude of this takeover. All over the country, governors, legislatures,
[03:15.520 --> 03:20.880]  they're all declaring war on the Second Amendment. New York Senate passes draconian gun bill.
[03:20.880 --> 03:24.480]  We've got some good news though, sheriffs all over the US are going public and we have
[03:24.480 --> 03:29.400]  one particular video we're gonna play coming up. Sheriff says teachers should be armed,
[03:29.400 --> 03:32.160]  Second Amendment shall not be infringed.
[03:32.160 --> 03:37.440]  And Aaron Dykes' video report is up on our YouTube channel and at prisonplanet.tv. That's
[03:37.440 --> 03:42.640]  why we have those auxiliary sites so that when in full war is down, people are able
[03:42.640 --> 03:49.440]  to get there. Rand Paul slams King Obama over executive order. And there's also talk in
[03:49.440 --> 03:55.920]  the Congress of impeachment against Obama. In fact, guys, will you go to the search engine
[03:55.920 --> 03:56.920]  and type in impeachment?
[03:56.920 --> 04:02.280]  Cuz I saw several articles this morning that I forgot to print out or send to you. And
[04:02.280 --> 04:09.480]  I wanna be able to show those news articles that there's multiple people in Congress now
[04:09.480 --> 04:14.560]  talking about impeachment. And that is the only way. I mean, that should have happened
[04:14.560 --> 04:19.880]  when Obama's get fast and furious or when they said that our military was under NATO
[04:19.880 --> 04:22.520]  command and Congress should sit down and shut up.
[04:22.520 --> 04:28.360]  GOP congressman threatens impeachment if Obama uses executive action for gun control. That
[04:28.360 --> 04:37.680]  is a report there that we're gonna be going over as well today. That is just some of what
[04:37.680 --> 04:45.120]  we're going to be breaking down. But this is it. This is the big enchilada. And I hope
[04:45.120 --> 04:50.640]  that everybody realizes that this is the time to put up or shut up beside which side of
[04:50.640 --> 04:53.080]  the republic that we are on.
[04:53.080 --> 05:00.600]  We'll be right back. Stay with us.

[08:24.360 --> 08:30.320]  Ladies and gentlemen, these are the times that try men's souls. It's times that we all
[08:30.320 --> 08:35.680]  have to have a gut check and get right with God. Everything that we have unfortunately
[08:35.680 --> 08:42.120]  predicted these globalists would do is now unfolding and soon the gun confiscation will
[08:42.120 --> 08:44.360]  be in the present.
[08:44.360 --> 08:48.960]  It's in the near future right now and then soon we will be in the aftermath of whatever
[08:48.960 --> 08:54.720]  comes out of this. Now, ladies and gentlemen, the corporate media in collusion with the
[08:54.720 --> 09:02.480]  politicians and their globalist owners are openly saying in the news, the president is
[09:02.480 --> 09:05.880]  allowed to take guns by executive order.
[09:05.880 --> 09:10.880]  The president is allowed to shut down gun shows by executive order. The president is
[09:10.880 --> 09:16.520]  allowed to order you to turn your semi-autos in. And they are passing or are in the process
[09:16.520 --> 09:21.940]  of passing outright gun confiscation in multiple states right now. We're going to be going
[09:21.940 --> 09:28.440]  over all of it. Now, if you go to DrudgeReport.com, you see the big headline up there, Congressman
[09:28.440 --> 09:38.200]  threatens Obama with impeachment if he tries to use executive action to restrict the Second
[09:38.200 --> 09:43.080]  Amendment. And if you click on that report, it's from the Daily Caller.
[09:43.080 --> 09:48.200]  We have our own reports obviously predicting this the last few months because the gun control
[09:48.200 --> 09:52.720]  group said, don't worry, once he gets reelected, we're going to use executive action. People
[09:52.720 --> 09:58.240]  are like, Alex, don't fear monger, that's unconstitutional, he won't do that. Texas
[09:58.240 --> 10:03.320]  Republican Representative Steve Stockman, who you notice Larry Pratt has pointed out
[10:03.320 --> 10:07.840]  would be our champion and had told him privately he would do this, threatened Monday afternoon
[10:07.840 --> 10:10.000]  that he would file articles of impeachment.
[10:10.000 --> 10:15.280]  Let's get it going, let's go, against President Barack Obama if he institutes gun control
[10:15.280 --> 10:20.640]  measures with an executive order. Stockman warned that such executive orders will be
[10:20.640 --> 10:25.560]  unconstitutional and infringe on our constitutionally protected right to keep and bear arms. And
[10:25.560 --> 10:31.880]  he went on to say that I will seek to thwart this action by any means necessary, including
[10:31.880 --> 10:37.060]  but not limited to, eliminating funding for implementation, defunding the White House
[10:37.060 --> 10:39.760]  and even filing articles of impeachment.
[10:39.760 --> 10:43.880]  Stockman said in a statement, boy, he didn't wanna get on the airplanes anytime soon, we
[10:43.880 --> 10:49.360]  need more people to come out and support him now, like Rand Paul, now, not later. That
[10:49.360 --> 10:53.160]  this is late they're doing this, this should have been done a long time ago. At his press
[10:53.160 --> 10:57.840]  conference Monday, Obama floated the possibility of using executive action to enact policies
[10:57.840 --> 10:59.240]  aimed at reducing gun violence.
[10:59.240 --> 11:04.640]  He didn't float it, look, look, you see this magazine, this was published in late November.
[11:04.640 --> 11:12.040]  And it says this man wants your guns, December issue of Enforce Magazine. And in the article,
[11:12.040 --> 11:20.240]  go read it, we sent out an e-version of it to everybody. We have 10 predictions for 2013
[11:20.240 --> 11:25.760]  and it's they would be coming for our guns by Mike Adams. In fact, the prediction in
[11:25.760 --> 11:30.560]  here is that they would use executive action to do it, boom, that happened.
[11:30.560 --> 11:34.760]  You've got the article, Obama wants your guns and the rest of your freedoms. And we go on
[11:34.760 --> 11:39.720]  to say they will use executive action to get our guns. Why? Because they said they would
[11:39.720 --> 11:45.440]  do that, okay? Now, here we are, and some of the more timid mainline conservatives are
[11:45.440 --> 11:50.280]  like, how dare you get in a red coat's face and say, look, it's gonna cause a civil war
[11:50.280 --> 11:54.720]  if you do this.
[11:54.720 --> 11:59.220]  It's not that we want one of these civil wars, it's that they have set up Homeland Security
[11:59.220 --> 12:03.280]  and put it in a posture where they say gun owners, conservatives, libertarians, returning
[12:03.280 --> 12:10.960]  veterans are the enemy. And they've got the state police all over the United States training
[12:10.960 --> 12:11.960]  for gun confiscation.
[12:11.960 --> 12:16.840]  The new army manuals that we've listed and shown over 100 times here, they talk about
[12:16.840 --> 12:25.840]  gun confiscation in US cities. This is now happening, this is now unfolding, this isn't
[12:25.840 --> 12:33.160]  a game, this isn't a joke, this isn't a drill, this is the real deal. In fact, as soon as
[12:33.160 --> 12:41.960]  infoawards.com is back up, we're rebooting it and doing some scans of the site.
[12:41.960 --> 12:47.440]  As soon as it's back up, I'm gonna have Kurt Nemo, Paul Watson, I'm gonna have all of them.
[12:47.440 --> 12:51.360]  Cuz I called Paul Watson about 7 this morning, even before I saw the Daily Caller. And I
[12:51.360 --> 12:55.840]  said, we need to do a report on this congressman saying impeachment. And I said, impeachment
[12:55.840 --> 12:58.400]  is the way to go.
[12:58.400 --> 13:05.020]  And I said, now we've got to get on the offensive and we've got them on Fast and Furious, lying.
[13:05.020 --> 13:08.080]  The Republicans could gut the Democratic Party right now for all the stuff they've done.
[13:08.080 --> 13:11.400]  They don't want to cuz they're bought and paid for at the top by the same people, Boehner
[13:11.400 --> 13:15.440]  and all the rest of them. They're traitors, they're Benedict Arnold's.
[13:15.440 --> 13:19.080]  Three hearings last year where they told Congress NATO is now over the military and tells the
[13:19.080 --> 13:24.840]  president what to do. We don't come to Congress, boom, instant impeachment. Obama ordering
[13:24.840 --> 13:29.520]  the Department of Energy to shut down coal power plants outside of law, massively increasing
[13:29.520 --> 13:37.120]  our power prices outside of congressional law, boom, impeachable right there.
[13:37.120 --> 13:41.940]  And so I want Paul Watson, and I want Kurt Nemo, and I want Adan Salazar, and I want
[13:41.940 --> 13:46.520]  Steve Watson. And I want all the rest of our riders, everybody else out there should be
[13:46.520 --> 13:53.840]  beating the drum, beating the drum for all out impeachment. And we're gonna impeach Obama
[13:53.840 --> 13:54.840]  publicly.
[13:54.840 --> 13:59.120]  Hold on, Watson, listen, remember this morning I called you and I said the way to go is to
[13:59.120 --> 14:03.040]  go after him and call for impeachment for all the stuff they've done. We need to put
[14:03.040 --> 14:07.480]  out our own articles of impeachment. And I'm gonna talk about the articles of impeachment
[14:07.480 --> 14:08.760]  on air in the next hour.
[14:08.760 --> 14:12.600]  Okay, and you can go check everything I say historically and pull it up. There's at least
[14:12.600 --> 14:17.240]  ten reasons, people always like the number ten, ten reasons to impeach Obama, that we
[14:17.240 --> 14:23.040]  must impeach Obama now. Okay, we've gotta get on the offense. And we've gotta get behind
[14:23.040 --> 14:27.800]  this Texas congressman and others, okay?
[14:27.800 --> 14:32.920]  Because it's just all out. And by the way, while Infowars is down, you can go to prisonplanet.com.
[14:32.920 --> 14:37.080]  And again, we're trying to upgrade and revamp the site so they can handle the increased
[14:37.080 --> 14:41.800]  traffic. We're getting like three times the traffic we used to the last week and a half.
[14:41.800 --> 14:48.960]  And it's just sustained. And the ad servers just can't handle it, so I'm suspending outside
[14:48.960 --> 14:49.960]  ads.
[14:49.960 --> 14:54.100]  So let's have our own house ads up there just to get the info out. So they're busy reloading
[14:54.100 --> 14:57.920]  the site right now and everything else. And I'm just telling the listeners that right
[14:57.920 --> 15:02.920]  now, prisonplanet.com is the backup auxiliary, be sure and go there. And Paul, we just need
[15:02.920 --> 15:07.920]  to go through also, you and Steve are always good at ferreting out old articles.
[15:07.920 --> 15:11.240]  How many articles did we write the last year saying he would become a dictator, he would
[15:11.240 --> 15:16.840]  use executive orders and we have to impeach now. We need to also flashback so people understand
[15:16.840 --> 15:20.700]  not hey, look, we're smart. Hey, look, we know what we're talking about, better listen
[15:20.700 --> 15:21.700]  to us, okay?
[15:21.700 --> 15:29.800]  So have somebody do a report on that, okay? All right, God bless you, my friend. Thank
[15:29.800 --> 15:35.960]  you. All right, by the way, ladies and gentlemen, I guess Infowars is back up now. That was
[15:35.960 --> 15:42.040]  Prison Planet, okay, Infowars should be back up soon.
[15:42.040 --> 15:47.700]  New York State Senator, gun bill passed in the middle of the night turns law abiding
[15:47.700 --> 15:52.600]  citizens into criminals. That's how mafia does it. New York Senate passes tough gun
[15:52.600 --> 15:58.360]  control law. Paul, most Americans support new gun control measures after Newtown massacre.
[15:58.360 --> 16:03.360]  By the way, this is how they play it. The Washington Post puts out some fraudulent poll.
[16:03.360 --> 16:08.240]  Post polls show the majority of people are pro second amendment all the way. And it doesn't
[16:08.240 --> 16:13.900]  matter if 51% say they wanna put me in chains and make me pull a plow, I don't have to do
[16:13.900 --> 16:15.080]  it under natural law.
[16:15.080 --> 16:21.080]  If 51% say I gotta turn my guns and I don't have to. If 51% say they support Obama becoming
[16:21.080 --> 16:26.040]  a dictator, it's not just my right, it's my duty to resist. Do you understand the globalist
[16:26.040 --> 16:32.680]  have installed dictators over multiple European countries? Do you understand we're going head
[16:32.680 --> 16:34.040]  long into tyranny?
[16:34.040 --> 16:40.640]  Look at this, Politico, Joe Biden, White House eyeing 19 executive actions on guns. Iowa
[16:40.640 --> 16:48.560]  lawmaker calls for retroactive gun ban, confiscation of semi-automatic weapons. New York Assembly
[16:48.560 --> 16:56.920]  Speaker Silver, we are going to ban assault weapons. Boom, gonna ban them, make you turn
[16:56.920 --> 17:01.920]  them in. And see, that's what the bill that's passed the Senate in New York says.
[17:01.920 --> 17:05.520]  That's what Cuomo said two weeks ago in the New York Times. People are like, this can't
[17:05.520 --> 17:10.200]  be true. I mean, he's on the radio saying it. The New York Times wrote about it. We
[17:10.200 --> 17:13.280]  wrote a story about it and people couldn't believe it. They wouldn't even follow the
[17:13.280 --> 17:16.360]  links to find out it was true.
[17:16.360 --> 17:21.320]  Because you can't believe it's actually coming to this. Yes, they're coming, they're coming,
[17:21.320 --> 17:26.920]  they're coming for us. They want to get a shooting war started. That's why I went on
[17:26.920 --> 17:34.120]  CNN and said don't start this. Because people need to know where this is going. People need
[17:34.120 --> 17:39.200]  a heads up, ladies and gentlemen.
[17:39.200 --> 17:45.840]  Let's play Rand Paul on gun control. And again, it's not gun control, folks. It's victim disarmament.
[17:45.840 --> 17:51.720]  It's enslavement. We need to stop using their terms. Here's Rand Paul saying King Obama.
[17:51.720 --> 17:52.720]  And Rand Paul-
[17:52.720 --> 17:57.800]  I think it's having a king. I think having a monarch is what we fought the American Revolution
[17:57.800 --> 18:04.000]  over. And someone who wants to bypass the Constitution, bypass Congress, that's someone
[18:04.000 --> 18:09.160]  who wants to act like a king or a monarch. I've been opposed to executive orders, even
[18:09.160 --> 18:13.320]  with Republican president. But one that wants to infringe on the Second Amendment, we will
[18:13.320 --> 18:19.320]  fight tooth and nail. And I promise you there'll be no rock left unturned as far as trying
[18:19.320 --> 18:25.920]  to stop him from usurping the Constitution, running roughshod over Congress. And you will
[18:25.920 --> 18:30.320]  see one heck of a debate if he decides to try to do this.
[18:30.320 --> 18:33.820]  Senator Paul spoke to us in our Jerusalem bureau. Look for more of his comments on the
[18:33.820 --> 18:37.960]  Middle East and Israel in the days ahead.
[18:37.960 --> 18:46.240]  That's not strong enough, Rand. Okay, you need to do what the Texas Congressman Steve
[18:46.240 --> 18:57.520]  Stockman has done. Okay, you need to get aggressive right now. And we need to start, not threatening
[18:57.520 --> 19:01.880]  impeachment. The president is saying he's gonna sign 19 executive orders taking our
[19:01.880 --> 19:04.180]  guns, okay?
[19:04.180 --> 19:09.920]  Now this is not a game. We've gotta come out and say this is illegal. The dictator word,
[19:09.920 --> 19:14.240]  not the king word, the dictator, it's here, it's happening. Let's go out to break with
[19:14.240 --> 19:18.240]  Rand Paul, here it is, one more time.
[19:18.240 --> 19:23.800]  I'm against having a king. I think having a monarch is what we fought the American Revolution
[19:23.800 --> 19:30.000]  over. And someone who wants to bypass the Constitution, bypass Congress, that's someone
[19:30.000 --> 19:32.520]  who wants to act like a king or a monarch.
[19:32.520 --> 19:35.840]  I've been opposed to executive orders even with Republicans.
[19:35.840 --> 19:40.320]  That's good, we're gonna go to break, but listen to me and listen good. Dictator, we
[19:40.320 --> 19:45.160]  are segueing into a dictatorship. People are like, well, wait, he got elected, Hitler got
[19:45.160 --> 19:49.400]  elected. If you get elected and then overthrow the checks and balances, it's called a dictator.
[19:49.400 --> 19:54.920]  The office is becoming a dictatorship. The executive run by the globalist, we're under
[19:54.920 --> 20:00.600]  occupation. Okay, those aren't words, that's the truth, we're occupied.
[20:00.600 --> 20:05.440]  Looking back on 2012, we ask ourselves, how did we ever survive from natural disasters
[20:05.440 --> 20:10.020]  like Hurricane Sandy and the devastating summer drought to the family hardships brought on
[20:10.020 --> 20:15.120]  by a disastrous economy? Our hearts go out to those that have lost everything. At eFoods

[20:28.480 --> 20:34.160]  in time to be able to help my sister and niece. It is better to be prepared 10 years too early

[24:22.160 --> 24:28.040]  Ladies and gentlemen, we are back live here. Yesterday, I was on air talking about what
[24:28.040 --> 24:34.500]  would Paul Revere do during this entire period of history. Mainline conservatives would call
[24:34.500 --> 24:38.080]  him a traitor, and if he rode down the street saying to arms to arms, the redcoats are coming
[24:38.080 --> 24:42.320]  to confiscate our guns, the average neocon would step out with pleasure and shoot him
[24:42.320 --> 24:47.320]  from the horse, guaranteed, and then salute the redcoats.
[24:47.320 --> 24:51.360]  And that's what some conservatives said about me. They said, you shouldn't yell, you shouldn't
[24:51.360 --> 24:58.840]  get upset. Really, our forebears killed people. When someone comes to usurp and enslave you,
[24:58.840 --> 25:02.720]  that's the response or you become a slave. I'm just trying to peacefully fix things.
[25:02.720 --> 25:09.560]  I'm a wimp compared to Paul Revere. But then the super wimps call me bad. And here is Boston
[25:09.560 --> 25:19.560]  Magazine, AMC is developing a show called We Hate Paul Revere.
[25:19.560 --> 25:26.080]  Isn't that just cute? And it's all over TV and the culture bad mouthing the founders.
[25:26.080 --> 25:30.680]  And they've got three or four different TV shows now that have just come out airing.
[25:30.680 --> 25:34.040]  One's called Founding Fathers, where anybody who's a patriot's evil. And guess who they
[25:34.040 --> 25:40.800]  waged war against? Gun owners during gun confiscation, and the gun owners are all horrible scum.
[25:40.800 --> 25:46.320]  And the army infiltrates them and takes them down in Texas. They've actuated this out.
[25:46.320 --> 25:52.120]  They knew it'd be Texas congressmen that resisted them like Steve Stockman. They knew, and so
[25:52.120 --> 25:57.960]  they've got all these TV shows on ABC, NBC, all airing, where the bad guys are the gun
[25:57.960 --> 26:04.040]  owning libertarians. They were all being developed last year.
[26:04.040 --> 26:07.960]  That's why I said they're coming for the guns next year, because of that and hundreds of
[26:07.960 --> 26:17.560]  other data points. They pre-program us, they get us ready. This is brainwashing. AMC is
[26:17.560 --> 26:22.800]  not satisfied with Mad Men's foray in the 1960s is setting a new comedy in colonial
[26:22.800 --> 26:30.400]  Boston and titling it We Hate Paul Revere.
[26:30.400 --> 26:35.500]  And it's basically about two brothers who are not fans of industrialist and activist
[26:35.500 --> 26:40.480]  Paul Revere. And then the show reportedly from Deadline Hollywood just makes the founders
[26:40.480 --> 26:47.160]  look bad. I mean, whoa, a bunch of TV shows demonizing the founders. This is what a foreign
[26:47.160 --> 26:54.560]  occupation force does. That isn't rhetoric, okay? And Obama's not becoming a king, he's
[26:54.560 --> 26:57.060]  becoming a dictator.
[26:57.060 --> 27:00.240]  And that's why the Republicans are going, you know what, we'll legalize the illegals.
[27:00.240 --> 27:04.080]  You know what, we will go for some gun control. You know what, we will raise taxes. You know
[27:04.080 --> 27:09.040]  what, we are gonna go for Obamacare. Because they've been told, you sit down and you shut
[27:09.040 --> 27:11.040]  up and you get in line.
[27:11.040 --> 27:14.360]  We know about your insider trading, we know about your girlfriend, we know about your
[27:14.360 --> 27:21.320]  boyfriend. A mafia takeover is taking place and I'm here going, hey man, we're in trouble.
[27:21.320 --> 27:27.320]  I'm here having to do this, which is not fun, but it's my duty, and I will not be a slave.
[27:27.320 --> 27:30.640]  And then I get to watch all these armchair quarterbacks going, man, you're going a little
[27:30.640 --> 27:36.600]  far, don't raise your voice. Okay, fine, folks, they're gonna take everything, okay? You got
[27:36.600 --> 27:37.600]  that?
[27:37.600 --> 27:41.280]  They're gonna gut the country, open North American Union, toll roads on all the roads,
[27:41.280 --> 27:47.080]  doubling, tripling water prices, energy prices. They are going to rape us. They've said they're
[27:47.080 --> 27:52.260]  going to rape us. And as things get worse and worse, I was on Current TV with The Young
[27:52.260 --> 27:53.260]  Turks last night.
[27:53.260 --> 27:57.680]  And he's like, come on, all right, they secretly arrest us. They've got more wireless wiretapping.
[27:57.680 --> 28:02.960]  They're setting up highway checkpoints. You're right, but still, do you need mental health?
[28:02.960 --> 28:08.600]  You shouldn't get upset about this. And I'm like, you know what, you're mentally ill.
[28:08.600 --> 28:13.400]  If I was in Nazi Germany in 1941 saying this is wrong, I would have been called insane.
[28:13.400 --> 28:17.320]  If I was in the Aztec Kingdom 500 years ago, I would have been called insane for saying
[28:17.320 --> 28:22.680]  don't have human sacrifices. That's what I said to him. He just laughed at me, man. It's
[28:22.680 --> 28:25.120]  funny to these people.
[28:25.120 --> 28:29.200]  All this is happening. It's all happening. It's all gonna get worse and worse. There's
[28:29.200 --> 28:35.600]  army manuals on FEMA camps. There's army manuals on gun confiscation. And people are so cowardly
[28:35.600 --> 28:41.360]  they flip it around and go, it's not that bad. Real cowards lie to themselves and say
[28:41.360 --> 28:43.480]  something isn't happening or it's okay.
[28:43.480 --> 28:49.760]  Yeah, all this is happening, but it's not that bad. And then I am mentally ill. Because
[28:49.760 --> 28:54.620]  I see straight, I know history, I'm concerned, and I've got enough courage to get up here
[28:54.620 --> 28:59.440]  and put my name, my honor, everything on the line. Folks, they're testing us right now.
[28:59.440 --> 29:05.120]  If we bend over, ladies and gentlemen, if we lay down, they are gonna run right over
[29:05.120 --> 29:09.920]  the top of us. Again, a lot of people hear this show and they go, man, you're scaring
[29:09.920 --> 29:10.920]  me.
[29:10.920 --> 29:14.520]  Why are you trying to scare us? I don't think you're cowards. I mean, look, if you're in
[29:14.520 --> 29:21.260]  a parking lot and a guy comes up to you, and another guy behind you, and they go, we're
[29:21.260 --> 29:24.640]  gonna beat the daylights out of you, might as well go ahead and fight. There's nowhere
[29:24.640 --> 29:27.840]  to run, we're cornered in an alley.
[29:27.840 --> 29:31.880]  I'm not gonna lay down while they can kick me in the teeth. I mean, it just isn't happening.
[29:31.880 --> 29:38.800]  It's not an issue of courage. These are authoritarians who wanna gut this country. They're not liberals,
[29:38.800 --> 29:45.540]  they're authoritarian monsters. And their minions will soon be saying, so they're arresting
[29:45.540 --> 29:49.720]  right wingers, big deal, cuz they're now talking about that, just getting rid of us all.
[29:49.720 --> 30:01.120]  Here on the march, the empire's on the run. Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.

[32:05.560 --> 32:11.160]  economic system runs from bad to worse. The globalist model is to shut down societies

[33:26.880 --> 33:33.120]  there are four different TV shows airing or about to air on broadcast TV and cable bad
[33:33.120 --> 33:35.840]  mouthing the founding fathers.
[33:35.840 --> 33:41.280]  Situational comedies running them down. I hate Paul Revere. Shows like founding fathers
[33:41.280 --> 33:47.700]  and others coming out where they admit in the variety write ups that gun owners during
[33:47.700 --> 33:53.840]  gun confiscation resist and they are dealt with. And the average yuppie will sit there
[33:53.840 --> 33:58.420]  now and fantasize about being the SWAT teams hunting us down.
[33:58.420 --> 34:02.600]  And most of these shows are based again in Texas. The globalists know where their resistance
[34:02.600 --> 34:09.200]  is gonna come from. Because here's the deal, I can't give in to these people. Okay, I've
[34:09.200 --> 34:18.660]  said I'm not turning my guns in. I am a political information person. I don't plan in the early
[34:18.660 --> 34:24.120]  stages of this cuz I'm not gonna give them what they want, armed resistance.
[34:24.120 --> 34:28.200]  You know, I'm not sitting there watching my back. If they pull up and take my guns after
[34:28.200 --> 34:33.540]  they're banned, that will be something I'll try to fight through the courts and politically.
[34:33.540 --> 34:37.420]  But they're not gonna stop there. They're all over the news saying lock up gun owners
[34:37.420 --> 34:40.780]  and mental institutions. We're mentally ill because we don't wanna give up the Bill of
[34:40.780 --> 34:41.780]  Rights.
[34:41.780 --> 34:47.480]  When I was on Al Gore's foreign owned TV network owned by the Arabs last night, he sold it.
[34:47.480 --> 34:52.600]  They were saying, do you need mental help? And I'm like, why? Because we have the NDAA
[34:52.600 --> 34:57.800]  and secret arrest and army manuals training for gun confiscation and FEMA camps and all
[34:57.800 --> 35:01.800]  this stuff coming true.
[35:01.800 --> 35:10.440]  In fact, Bloomberg, here's one of the headlines. Bloomberg urged Obama to take executive action
[35:10.440 --> 35:17.000]  and to ban guns outside of Congress. He urged him to defy Congress. That's Bloomberg, the
[35:17.000 --> 35:20.420]  guy that wants to tell you what you can eat, where you can sleep, how big a house you can
[35:20.420 --> 35:24.620]  live in, how many painkillers hospitals can give out.
[35:24.620 --> 35:30.120]  He just has orders in New York. I order the hospitals not to distribute painkillers to
[35:30.120 --> 35:34.720]  people. I mean, it's just, I'm God. I tell you what to eat. I tell doctors what to do.
[35:34.720 --> 35:42.060]  It's called a dictator pig who swore he wouldn't run for reelection and then got the law changed.
[35:42.060 --> 35:49.140]  He helped passed on term limits. I mean, it's just a fraud. A guy with armed guards, a gangster.
[35:49.140 --> 35:53.840]  There have been 50 plus thousand signatures signed in Mexico to the Mexican government
[35:53.840 --> 35:58.500]  calling for the US citizens to have all our guns taken like the poor Mexican people who've
[35:58.500 --> 36:03.900]  had total gun bans and the highest crime rate in the world, almost 60,000 dead the last
[36:03.900 --> 36:06.340]  five years.
[36:06.340 --> 36:11.400]  Just mercilessly under the control of mafia and mafia government and our government saying,
[36:11.400 --> 36:15.000]  yes, the Mexicans want us to turn our guns and we better do it. And we've got the British
[36:15.000 --> 36:20.660]  government and we've got Piers Morgan and the Russian TV and the Chinese TV, all saying
[36:20.660 --> 36:28.060]  take their guns. And the UN treaty coming up in March. They've got the whole world guns
[36:28.060 --> 36:34.900]  confiscated and they've got to get us in line with global governance.
[36:34.900 --> 36:40.140]  And again, the impeachment must start now for Obama three times last year in a letter
[36:40.140 --> 36:44.580]  and three congressional committees saying NATO is over our military. And Congress said,
[36:44.580 --> 36:50.060]  no, wait, we fund the military. We direct all that and the president executes it like
[36:50.060 --> 36:52.240]  the football coach.
[36:52.240 --> 37:02.180]  But he's given the playbook agreed upon by the general manager. And they said, no, we're
[37:02.180 --> 37:09.260]  going to be under NATO command. Boom, impeach him for that. Obama needs to be impeached
[37:09.260 --> 37:12.820]  for Fast and Furious. They've all been caught perjuring themselves and lying. We have them
[37:12.820 --> 37:16.420]  doing press conferences before they even got caught shipping the guns in, talking about
[37:16.420 --> 37:21.260]  the Operation Gunwalker and Fast and Furious.
[37:21.260 --> 37:23.740]  People that said they never knew about it were doing press conferences on it when they
[37:23.740 --> 37:28.340]  were promoting it, when the public didn't know the full extent of it. Boom, perjury
[37:28.340 --> 37:33.260]  right there. Obama shutting down power plants so that his buddies in General Electric make
[37:33.260 --> 37:35.380]  bigger profits and increasing our power prices.
[37:35.380 --> 37:39.860]  When Congress didn't pass his carbon tax legislation three years ago, he's still just doing it
[37:39.860 --> 37:46.700]  by executive fiat. We need to start the impeachment of Obama for directing the auto bailout to
[37:46.700 --> 37:52.140]  spend $20 plus billion to ship General Motors, Volt, and Cadillac factories to Eastern Europe,
[37:52.140 --> 37:58.060]  China, and Brazil. Boom, impeach for that economic espionage against this country.
[37:58.060 --> 38:07.740]  Get impeachment for his environmental departments and people involved in using shadow email
[38:07.740 --> 38:12.540]  systems throughout his administration. Start the impeachment hearings now and start the
[38:12.540 --> 38:20.780]  impeachment hearing saying he can use executive orders to restrict our Second Amendment.
[38:20.780 --> 38:27.000]  And actively promoting that sedition and that treason against our republic. What more evidence
[38:27.000 --> 38:39.740]  do you need? And the executive power grabs just go on from there. The conflicts of interest.
[38:39.740 --> 38:44.100]  He needs to be impeached. Of course, Congress is involved in treason as well. But it doesn't
[38:44.100 --> 38:49.100]  mean you can't have good members that voted against it on the NDAA to secretly arrest
[38:49.100 --> 38:50.100]  Americans.
[38:50.100 --> 38:57.940]  Here's a big one. His secret order on cybersecurity, which then the EU and others bragged, that
[38:57.940 --> 39:01.900]  gives him control of the Internet. He's gonna give the UN control of the Internet. Congress
[39:01.900 --> 39:08.420]  being told two months ago, you can't see my secret order, my secret cyber order when Congress
[39:08.420 --> 39:13.700]  has the power of the purse and the power over the agencies as a checks and balance.
[39:13.700 --> 39:21.360]  He said, I signed a secret order. And the impeachable offenses go on and on and on.
[39:21.360 --> 39:30.260]  But chief amongst them is Obama saying he's preparing to act with executive orders. Also,
[39:30.260 --> 39:36.360]  he had the ATF last year with a rule, rulemaking order gun shops when they sold more than two
[39:36.360 --> 39:41.500]  guns to report it to ATF as a suspicious transaction to order a criminal investigation.
[39:41.500 --> 39:45.620]  And to open that when it's already on record that you bought firearms through the instant
[39:45.620 --> 39:55.300]  check, and that's law. What they did is outside of law, extrajudicial. I mean, there's many
[39:55.300 --> 40:00.500]  other examples, and many a constitutional lawyer has pointed this out. And by the way,
[40:00.500 --> 40:02.780]  I wanna get Edwin Viera on.
[40:02.780 --> 40:11.620]  I wanna get Lou Rockwell back on. I wanna get constitutional lawyer Fine back on to
[40:11.620 --> 40:17.740]  pick their brains and other examples, and we need to codify articles of impeachment.
[40:17.740 --> 40:23.700]  I want Paul Watson to take the points I just put together. Write the article, I'll approve
[40:23.700 --> 40:29.660]  it during the broadcast later, slap my name on it, my John Hancock on it, and we'll put
[40:29.660 --> 40:34.700]  that out there. Just an example to people, because we gotta ride out like Paul Revere
[40:34.700 --> 40:37.980]  and at least point out the treason that's going on.
[40:37.980 --> 40:45.500]  I mean, are there any men left in this country? Is there anybody that cares about freedom
[40:45.500 --> 40:52.660]  left in this country? I got another one for you. Obama last year signed a directive, not
[40:52.660 --> 40:59.860]  an executive order, not a national security order, not a PDD, presidential decision directive.
[40:59.860 --> 41:10.940]  Just a directive, just a letter to ICE saying this large swath of illegal aliens, do we
[41:10.940 --> 41:11.940]  forget this?
[41:11.940 --> 41:17.220]  This is why he's now saying he'll just take our guns, cuz he's gotten away with it. He
[41:17.220 --> 41:20.980]  comes out and he says, I'm gonna sign this order saying we're just gonna go ahead and
[41:20.980 --> 41:27.860]  legalize these illegal aliens kids who weren't born here, but they're under 18. And so we're
[41:27.860 --> 41:35.220]  just gonna legalize you, we're just gonna say you're legal now.
[41:35.220 --> 41:38.580]  And now he's talking about an executive order just legalizing all the illegal aliens that
[41:38.580 --> 41:42.300]  are here and then letting them bring their families here. And then they're all gonna
[41:42.300 --> 41:46.100]  be on welfare, and then they're all going to be able to go vote illegally. We all know
[41:46.100 --> 41:48.380]  that goes on all day long.
[41:48.380 --> 41:52.060]  Cuz they give them driver's licenses everywhere, you got driver's licenses, you vote. And it's,
[41:52.060 --> 41:59.500]  hey, we already got 56,000 Mexicans being reported, signing a petition. I mean, look
[41:59.500 --> 42:04.140]  at these headlines, Joe Biden, White House eyeing 19 executive actions on guns. They're
[42:04.140 --> 42:09.220]  eyeing executive actions and they're saying, we're gonna lean on gun manufacturers, lean
[42:09.220 --> 42:10.860]  on the retailers.
[42:10.860 --> 42:16.260]  What did Chuck Schumer say? They've said their plan, they've gone and had public meetings.
[42:16.260 --> 42:24.620]  We saw Rahm Emanuel say, the police are over, who can have guns now. The public isn't part
[42:24.620 --> 42:29.700]  of that discussion now. I'm gonna play that clip in a moment. Joe Biden, White House eyeing
[42:29.700 --> 42:33.420]  19 executive actions on guns, Politico.
[42:33.420 --> 42:38.780]  Iowa lawmaker calls for retroactive gun ban, confiscation of semi-automatic weapons, door-to-door
[42:38.780 --> 42:46.460]  confiscation. Daily Times Herald out of Iowa. New York Assembly Speaker, Silver, we are
[42:46.460 --> 42:51.780]  going to ban assault weapons, CBS News, and make you physically turn them in. Boom, you
[42:51.780 --> 42:52.780]  hearing this?
[42:52.780 --> 42:57.740]  I thought I was a fear monger. By decree of the king, there are some steps we can take
[42:57.740 --> 43:01.460]  that don't require legislation. That's Obama. We're gonna play that clip in a minute. Rahm
[43:01.460 --> 43:05.980]  Emanuel, quote, take American people out of Second Amendment debate. Let me keep going
[43:05.980 --> 43:13.460]  here. In New York, preparing to put gun owners in mental hospitals.
[43:13.460 --> 43:18.700]  New York Senate passes draconian gun bill. Sheriff says teachers should be armed, Second
[43:18.700 --> 43:23.500]  Amendment shall not be infringed. That's in Kentucky. Folks are standing, that sheriff
[43:23.500 --> 43:28.180]  starts crying a little bit. He goes, I'm ashamed of the founding fathers were here. But he's
[43:28.180 --> 43:31.100]  freaking out cuz he realizes he's committed.
[43:31.100 --> 43:35.780]  He's drawn his line in the sand and he gets sad, not because he's scared. He's realizing
[43:35.780 --> 43:41.460]  what's happened here. How much trouble we're in. All you people out there need to get your
[43:41.460 --> 43:46.540]  heads out of the sand, folks. They're going for this cuz they think you're weak. That's
[43:46.540 --> 43:47.540]  what I told Piers Morgan.
[43:47.540 --> 43:52.460]  I said, there's gonna be some of us aren't going along. I'm not gonna play into your
[43:52.460 --> 43:58.580]  hands. They come to me and take me out, folks. I'm not planning to resist. I want that on
[43:58.580 --> 44:02.900]  record because the minute I said I would resist them, they'll come kill me. And they don't
[44:02.900 --> 44:08.340]  care about the minions that come. I'm out in the open here. But this is the waters we've
[44:08.340 --> 44:09.340]  entered.
[44:09.340 --> 44:14.980]  This is it. We're entering DEFCON 1 for the Second Amendment, ladies and gentlemen. If
[44:14.980 --> 44:25.260]  you don't know what DEFCON is, DEFCON, you better find out. Rand Paul slams King Obama
[44:25.260 --> 44:34.220]  over executive order threat. Report, Walmart forbids new ammunition orders.
[44:34.220 --> 44:40.580]  Mike Adams, war, thou son of hell. As America stands on the verge of domestic war, my heart
[44:40.580 --> 44:49.100]  sobs for histories. And history harshly learned. And then I've got my articles here in the
[44:49.100 --> 44:57.420]  stack. In fact, I had that in my stack where it's up on infowars.com, it's now back up.
[44:57.420 --> 45:03.860]  Here it is, 54,000 Mexicans signed petition, that's out of Fox News, for US gun control
[45:03.860 --> 45:09.420]  and for us to have our guns taken. Oakland leaders have lost grip on violence. Everything's
[45:09.420 --> 45:15.900]  disintegrating.
[45:15.900 --> 45:18.580]  And a lot of people are just like, well, I'll just do what they want. I'll just turn them
[45:18.580 --> 45:22.780]  around. They're gonna take everything, folks. They are already doubling power prices in
[45:22.780 --> 45:25.980]  many areas of the country, shutting down the power plants that are city and state owned,
[45:25.980 --> 45:27.540]  that are totally clean.
[45:27.540 --> 45:31.820]  So General Electric makes huge profits. They wanna bankrupt you, they want you poor. This
[45:31.820 --> 45:36.300]  is like Stalin shutting off the food and not letting farmers produce their own food in
[45:36.300 --> 45:42.420]  Ukraine. Let's start going to these clips. Let's go to Rand Paul one more time, saying
[45:42.420 --> 45:48.220]  King Obama. And then we'll go to Obama saying, I can accomplish through executive order.
[45:48.220 --> 45:49.460]  Let's go to that.
[45:49.460 --> 45:54.820]  I'm against having a king. I think having a monarch is what we fought the American Revolution
[45:54.820 --> 46:01.260]  over. And someone who wants to bypass the Constitution, bypass Congress, that's someone
[46:01.260 --> 46:03.220]  who wants to act like a king or a monarch.
[46:03.220 --> 46:04.220]  All right, that's enough.
[46:04.220 --> 46:05.220]  I've been opposed to executive order.
[46:05.220 --> 46:08.820]  And he goes on to say, he'll do whatever he can in the law and Congress will fight him.
[46:08.820 --> 46:13.020]  No, impeach now. And by the way, people are like, why are they so arrogant? This is so
[46:13.020 --> 46:18.540]  illegal what they're doing. They're going to stage false flags and blame it on the Patriots.
[46:18.540 --> 46:22.540]  You can bet your bottom dollar that they're gonna blow stuff up and then play clips of
[46:22.540 --> 46:25.740]  people like myself saying 1776 will commence.
[46:25.740 --> 46:30.700]  And we've got to have people on the ground the minute stuff happens videotaping. That's
[46:30.700 --> 46:34.540]  one thing holding them back is when they did the underwear bombing thing when they staged
[46:34.540 --> 46:39.300]  that. We had witnesses that were there and saw it and later it came out in Congress that
[46:39.300 --> 46:41.020]  indeed it was a government operation.
[46:41.020 --> 46:48.620]  Yeah, that came out. So again, ladies and gentlemen, they're gonna hit more schools.
[46:48.620 --> 46:52.300]  I have no doubt they were behind Sandy Hook. You can see it all riding on the wall. All
[46:52.300 --> 46:58.620]  the evidence is there. Look it up for yourself. And this is their season. They're going for
[46:58.620 --> 47:06.020]  broke. And police and military better understand the plan is for us to kill each other.
[47:06.020 --> 47:14.480]  Okay, let's go to the next clip here. This is Obama in his press conference yesterday.
[47:14.480 --> 47:21.420]  And Biden's saying it's 19 orders he's planning. 19 things. This is a purge against gun owners.
[47:21.420 --> 47:25.700]  They want a war. That's why they're now saying he is Lincoln. I told you four years ago this
[47:25.700 --> 47:26.700]  was a plan.
[47:26.700 --> 47:32.980]  He is Lincoln, his face on Lincoln. He is Lincoln. He will crush us. He will show us.
[47:32.980 --> 47:37.080]  He will show us the federal power. Here is Lincoln right now.
[47:37.080 --> 47:42.220]  My understanding is the vice president's gonna provide a range of steps that we can take
[47:42.220 --> 47:47.820]  to reduce gun violence. Some of them will require legislation. Some of them I can accomplish
[47:47.820 --> 47:53.140]  through executive action. And so I'll be reviewing those today. And as I said, I'll speak in
[47:53.140 --> 47:58.640]  more detail to what we're gonna go ahead and propose later in the week.
[47:58.640 --> 48:03.300]  But I'm confident that there's some steps that we can take that don't require legislation
[48:03.300 --> 48:11.660]  and that are within my authority as president. And where you get a step that has the opportunity
[48:11.660 --> 48:14.420]  to reduce the possibility of gun violence.
[48:14.420 --> 48:18.540]  That's enough. It all goes on, the articles up at mfullwars.com and prisonblonded.com
[48:18.540 --> 48:26.260]  right now. He says he can have warrantless wiretapping without law of you cuz he's God.
[48:26.260 --> 48:30.780]  He says he can shut down our power plants without law. He's God. He can give waivers
[48:30.780 --> 48:33.900]  to his friends and not have to get Obamacare for their employees. He's God. He can say
[48:33.900 --> 48:35.300]  that well, he's not God.
[48:35.300 --> 48:40.180]  The UN and NATO are God and they say he can launch wars cuz he's a peace prize winner.
[48:40.180 --> 48:44.300]  The plan is to try to start a civil war and use homeland security that was set up day
[48:44.300 --> 48:50.840]  one to attack the states, legislatures and the people. And this is pre-Obama. The John
[48:50.840 --> 48:56.460]  Warren Defense Authorization Act of 2007. Now six years ago, five and a half years ago,
[48:56.460 --> 49:00.540]  states for insurrection by the states and legislatures.
[49:00.540 --> 49:05.700]  Obama was scripted for his role of Lincoln from the beginning. And now they admit it.
[49:05.700 --> 49:10.220]  He's gonna be our Lincoln, but not Lincoln for a north versus south that you can debate.
[49:10.220 --> 49:14.340]  And Lincoln was a tyrant. You can't debate the fact that he arrested hundreds of newspaper
[49:14.340 --> 49:19.940]  editors, members of Congress, you name it. It was martial law by a dictator. He overturned
[49:19.940 --> 49:26.940]  theirs. This is a occupying dictator under a foreign corporate takeover and they've already
[49:26.940 --> 49:35.360]  got countries like Spain, to a great extent, but the ones that are 100% are Italy and Greece
[49:35.360 --> 49:41.440]  where they appoint the technocratic leaders, the former Goldman Sachs heads.
[49:41.440 --> 49:46.220]  And they're gonna do it. And they want war with the American people. Let's go to one
[49:46.220 --> 49:53.540]  more clip here. This is Obama. I won't take your guns away. I won't take your guns.
[49:53.540 --> 49:57.060]  When y'all go home and you're talking to your buddies and they say, he wants to take my
[49:57.060 --> 50:04.460]  gun away. You've heard it here. I'm on television, so everybody knows it. I believe in the Second
[50:04.460 --> 50:11.900]  Amendment. I believe in people's lawful right to bear arms. I will not take your shotgun
[50:11.900 --> 50:19.620]  away. I will not take your rifle away. I won't take your handgun away.
[50:19.620 --> 50:26.460]  But they're now saying that they're going to order everyone under executive order, that's
[50:26.460 --> 50:30.080]  what they're floating in the Washington Post, you name it, to come and get your lawfully
[50:30.080 --> 50:35.500]  already bought guns or guns your grandfather gave you when he died, some semi-auto from
[50:35.500 --> 50:40.500]  the 50s. And you're gonna go in while gangsters, let me tell you, they're gangsters, I've been
[50:40.500 --> 50:44.700]  around them. They're going to say, all right, hey, you're looking at me wrong. You got a
[50:44.700 --> 50:52.460]  problem? I'll arrest you right now. Line up. Get the serial number. Now get out, get out
[50:52.460 --> 50:57.540]  of here, you American trash. That's how they talk to you. Get out of here. They're gangsters.
[50:57.540 --> 51:00.620]  They know they got to be in your face to keep you down.
[51:00.620 --> 51:04.360]  If you've ever wanted one of our best selling generators, but we're waiting for an offer
[51:04.360 --> 51:09.300]  so crazy you couldn't refuse, then you're not going to want to miss this exciting message.
[51:09.300 --> 51:15.120]  Here's why. Our solar generators provide life-saving electrical power. And unlike gas generators,
[51:15.120 --> 51:20.220]  solar generators run quietly, emit no fumes, and produce electricity from the sun. So when
[51:20.220 --> 51:25.060]  the lights go out, you'll always have the power you need. Now here's the best part.
[51:25.060 --> 51:30.260]  Every year we accumulate a few solar generators that we just can't sell as new. We put them
[51:30.260 --> 51:35.600]  in a special spot in our warehouse, and we discount them heavily at the end of each year.
[51:35.600 --> 51:40.500]  We call them scratch and dent units, but they're really just like new. Each unit comes with
[51:40.500 --> 51:45.500]  a full factory warranty and special bonuses you just won't believe. Don't wait. They go
[51:45.500 --> 51:51.100]  fast. Go to scratchanddentsolar.com. That's scratchanddentsolar.com. For the craziest

[52:05.320 --> 52:10.780]  Pastor Ginny, and that was the state I was in back in 2010. Then I learned about RNA
[52:10.780 --> 52:17.140]  drops. I learned that 97% of my DNA that scientists have called junk is actually packed with millions
[52:17.140 --> 52:21.900]  of gene switches that play a critical role in controlling how my cells, organs, and other
[52:21.900 --> 52:26.140]  tissues behave. I learned I don't have to put up with disease decay or decline like
[52:26.140 --> 52:31.840]  I'd been conditioned to believe. I began taking RNA drops, a 100% natural formula designed
[52:31.840 --> 52:37.340]  to turn on those switches and provide me with amazing health and joy. Learn more about RNA

[52:57.100 --> 53:03.580]  Hello, this is Ty Bollinger, author of the bestselling book, Cancer Step Outside the
[53:03.580 --> 53:09.860]  Box. I want you to know some very important information. In 1985, President Ronald Reagan
[53:09.860 --> 53:14.000]  requested that Carnivora be sent directly to the White House at a time when only the
[53:14.000 --> 53:19.580]  president could obtain its world-class healer. Now, 27 years later, Carnivora capsules are
[53:19.580 --> 53:24.100]  used around the world to keep people healthy. Now you can protect yourself and your loved

[53:57.700 --> 54:20.780]  It's the only one you've got.
[54:20.780 --> 54:40.580]  So I defended myself. I shot the sheriff.
[54:50.780 --> 54:59.980]  He's done his self-defense. Let's cue up Obama one more time. We'll play it in a second saying
[54:59.980 --> 55:05.360]  I won't take your guns because it's now official. They've told the establishment a mouthpiece
[55:05.360 --> 55:10.140]  Washington Post where they've been announcing all their plans. White House to announce gun
[55:10.140 --> 55:16.540]  plans Wednesday, which they said they do before New Haven even happened, before Sandy Hook
[55:16.540 --> 55:21.340]  happened, before Aurora happened. President Obama will unveil a sweeping set of gun control
[55:21.340 --> 55:27.700]  proposals, victim disarmament, at midday Wednesday, high noon, including an assault weapons ban.
[55:27.700 --> 55:32.060]  And they're saying it's going to be a physical turn in. Universal background checks and limits
[55:32.060 --> 55:36.700]  on the number of bullets magazines can hold, according to sources familiar with the plans.
[55:36.700 --> 55:40.500]  The announcement to be delivered by the White House is also expected to include a slate
[55:40.500 --> 55:48.180]  of up to 19 executive actions that the Obama administration can take on its own to attempt
[55:48.180 --> 55:53.340]  to limit gun violence. The White House has invited key lawmakers as well as gun control
[55:53.340 --> 55:58.300]  advocates to appear at Wednesday's policy rollout, according to two officials who have
[55:58.300 --> 55:59.780]  been invited to the event.
[55:59.780 --> 56:03.980]  Obama said at the news conference Monday that he would present his gun proposals later this
[56:03.980 --> 56:12.100]  week. A White House spokesman said Tuesday morning that he could not confirm the plans.
[56:12.100 --> 56:17.540]  And ladies and gentlemen, Bloomberg is out, there's video of it, running around saying
[56:17.540 --> 56:24.900]  just defy Congress, take them. Man, I mean, whoa, the headline should read Bloomberg calls
[56:24.900 --> 56:27.700]  for Obama to become open dictator.
[56:27.700 --> 56:34.940]  And I'll say this, and I've said it a million times, I will not bow to this. I am not going
[56:34.940 --> 56:39.980]  along with this. I may selfishly get my family out of the country. It just continues to degenerate
[56:39.980 --> 56:45.480]  this fast. But I am gonna stay here and deal with this. And believe me, that's not some
[56:45.480 --> 56:46.480]  macho thing.
[56:46.480 --> 56:51.660]  I'm not happy about this. I'm really sad. And folks, you should be freaked out. If your
[56:51.660 --> 56:55.180]  preachers are telling you go along with this, they're scum, leave that church. If your local
[56:55.180 --> 57:00.660]  talk show host is going along with this, they're scum. Now's the time to say no, no, no, you
[57:00.660 --> 57:02.300]  shall not pass.
[57:02.300 --> 57:09.040]  You shall not pass this gate. You shall not do this. Folks, there are a bunch of lawless
[57:09.040 --> 57:13.720]  globalists that strip countries down ruthlessly. If they'll do this to us, they'll do anything,
[57:13.720 --> 57:17.980]  and they are, they're gutting everything. They've already taken 47 trillion from us
[57:17.980 --> 57:19.220]  offshore.
[57:19.220 --> 57:26.620]  They're bankrupting us. We're going into bondage. It's world government. They're like, but they
[57:26.620 --> 57:30.780]  already run everything. Why are they doing this? Because they want war. They want domination.
[57:30.780 --> 57:35.620]  They want control. They hate you. They hate real Americans. They know you're not gonna
[57:35.620 --> 57:42.700]  turn your guns in. They want this to happen. They want a civil war.
[57:42.700 --> 57:45.820]  I just hope that when the history of this is written and these people end up losing
[57:45.820 --> 57:51.260]  that we have, like they supposedly had Nazi hunters, I hope these people are hunted down
[57:51.260 --> 57:56.900]  worldwide and brought to justice. No matter what happens to me, do not let them run to
[57:56.900 --> 57:58.700]  South America.
[57:58.700 --> 58:03.900]  Do not let them run to other countries. These people need to be held accountable. Nuremberg
[58:03.900 --> 58:08.020]  trials for all of them. Let's go out to break with Obama's pledge that he wasn't coming
[58:08.020 --> 58:10.860]  after any of your guns. Here it is.
[58:10.860 --> 58:16.940]  When y'all go home and you're talking to your buddies and he wants to take my gun away.
[58:16.940 --> 58:23.660]  You've heard it here. I'm on television. Everybody knows it. I believe in the Second Amendment.
[58:23.660 --> 58:30.220]  I believe in people's lawful right to bear arms. I will not take your shotgun away. I
[58:30.220 --> 58:35.420]  will not take your rifle away. I won't take your handgun away.
[58:35.420 --> 58:41.900]  We'll be back. I have a stack of articles saying they're going to confiscate our guns.
[58:41.900 --> 58:50.900]  This is GCN, the Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[58:50.900 --> 58:54.900]  Millions of people are going to get sick this winter from colds, flu and other illnesses.

[01:00:11.580 --> 01:00:20.420]  Well so does he. He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network. And now live from Austin, Texas,
[01:00:20.420 --> 01:00:32.820]  Alex Jones. America is being completely overthrown. There's been a lot of attacks on us. Our health
[01:00:32.820 --> 01:00:42.300]  freedom, forced inoculations going on outside of law. The open borders, all of it.
[01:00:42.300 --> 01:00:46.900]  But now they're talking about executive orders to restrict our Second Amendment. There's
[01:00:46.900 --> 01:00:51.580]  an all out call for Obama to basically be a dictator. It's very, very sad. I've had
[01:00:51.580 --> 01:00:56.340]  him scheduled for a few weeks. We're gonna talk to him about 30, 40 minutes and then
[01:00:56.340 --> 01:01:00.660]  we'll get back into how we need to move with articles of impeachment.
[01:01:00.660 --> 01:01:07.020]  And I wanted to get him on about what gluten does in the gut. Cuz I'm trying to go gluten
[01:01:07.020 --> 01:01:13.420]  free myself. And my wife's done it and had some amazing results and also wanted to get
[01:01:13.420 --> 01:01:20.700]  his take on the flu. And they admit they never guess which flu vaccine needs to be formulated
[01:01:20.700 --> 01:01:26.000]  to actually give you some protection from the flu, so it's a total hoax.
[01:01:26.000 --> 01:01:30.700]  And so it was such a popular interview we did about six months ago that I have twisted
[01:01:30.700 --> 01:01:37.460]  the arm of Theo Ratliff, the just now retired famous NBA star. Back on, well, this is coming
[01:01:37.460 --> 01:01:41.980]  up in the next segment, and Doc Wallach, to just talk about health news in general, but
[01:01:41.980 --> 01:01:47.080]  also talk about the fact that the establishment knows that we've got mineral and vitamin deficiencies
[01:01:47.080 --> 01:01:48.420]  and trace element deficiencies.
[01:01:48.420 --> 01:01:54.260]  But out of the gates, Dr. Wallach, what is your take on the move to disarm the American
[01:01:54.260 --> 01:01:57.460]  people with executive orders? I mean, if they can take the guns, they're gonna be able to
[01:01:57.460 --> 01:01:58.460]  take the supplements.
[01:01:58.460 --> 01:02:04.180]  Well, exactly right. Basically, I don't think the American people are gonna allow that to
[01:02:04.180 --> 01:02:09.580]  happen. I don't care what the Congress does. I deal a lot with farmers. I deal a lot with
[01:02:09.580 --> 01:02:14.900]  the average person. I'm out there giving 300 free lectures a year, Alex, all across this
[01:02:14.900 --> 01:02:15.900]  planet.
[01:02:15.900 --> 01:02:22.580]  And what we find out is that absolutely the American public is not gonna tolerate their
[01:02:22.580 --> 01:02:28.420]  weapons being taken away for self-defense. It is not gonna happen.
[01:02:28.420 --> 01:02:31.820]  What are folks telling you out there across the country you talk to?
[01:02:31.820 --> 01:02:36.940]  Well, people are digging holes and putting their weapons in. People are buying from each
[01:02:36.940 --> 01:02:43.420]  other as opposed to official areas. They're accumulating guns from, grandmas and grandpas
[01:02:43.420 --> 01:02:44.900]  aren't gonna use them.
[01:02:44.900 --> 01:02:52.060]  And they're actually accumulating weapons from private sales as opposed to sales from
[01:02:52.060 --> 01:02:58.380]  a Walmart or a Costco's or maybe a big sporting store, you know, these big five stores and
[01:02:58.380 --> 01:03:03.100]  things like that that sell weapons. So they're going to private sales.
[01:03:03.100 --> 01:03:10.740]  Well, I tell you, these are the times that tries people's souls. Why do you think the
[01:03:10.740 --> 01:03:15.500]  system is so bold to actually try to go after our guns right now, Dr. Wallach?
[01:03:15.500 --> 01:03:18.780]  Didn't Eric Holder say that crisis is a terrible thing to waste?
[01:03:18.780 --> 01:03:24.180]  Yeah, they've all said things, Rahm Emanuel, you name it.
[01:03:24.180 --> 01:03:31.060]  And so basically what they're doing is they're using this tragic story of this new town,
[01:03:31.060 --> 01:03:35.060]  what is it, Connecticut, where these kids were all shot.
[01:03:35.060 --> 01:03:37.340]  Yeah, Sandy Hook, it's outside there, yeah.
[01:03:37.340 --> 01:03:42.500]  Yeah, okay. And so basically, they missed the whole point. Really, when you look back
[01:03:42.500 --> 01:03:47.260]  and actually in the book, Rare Earths Been Cures, which you have in your bookstore, Rare
[01:03:47.260 --> 01:03:53.420]  Earths Been Cures, there's a whole section on these types of mass murders. And basically,
[01:03:53.420 --> 01:03:59.820]  they are caused by psychologists who don't want to give up their weekly check from talk
[01:03:59.820 --> 01:04:04.180]  therapy. They know, and there's actually laws in the cities and then the counties and in
[01:04:04.180 --> 01:04:10.140]  the states and federal government, where a caregiver who is a psychologist or psychiatrist
[01:04:10.140 --> 01:04:15.180]  can, in fact, have somebody institutionalized that they feel they're of eminent danger to
[01:04:15.180 --> 01:04:20.060]  themselves or the community. But the psychologists and psychiatrists say, you know, if I just
[01:04:20.060 --> 01:04:24.740]  put them on one more drug, I can keep them out of the institution because they give up
[01:04:24.740 --> 01:04:28.100]  their weekly check if they put them in an institution.
[01:04:28.100 --> 01:04:34.060]  And when you look at the records of these people who are managing these individuals
[01:04:34.060 --> 01:04:37.620]  who do the mass murder of serial killers, they've been working with them for a long
[01:04:37.620 --> 01:04:40.180]  time. It's not like it's any mystery that these people are dangerous.
[01:04:40.180 --> 01:04:44.180]  They know exactly, you know what, I want to recap that. And then obviously get Theo's
[01:04:44.180 --> 01:04:48.740]  take on this because it's such big news right now. And then we'll get into, you know, ADHD,
[01:04:48.740 --> 01:04:51.420]  you name it. I mean, they know vitamins and minerals are the answer. They know getting
[01:04:51.420 --> 01:04:54.540]  people off the the dyes of the answer. And I'm gonna talk about some of the incredible
[01:04:54.540 --> 01:05:00.900]  products as well from Young Jevity available at Infowarshealth.com.

[01:06:04.540 --> 01:06:09.540]  Tyranny is here. The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[01:06:09.540 --> 01:06:14.700]  It really says that the state is God. The United States is now recognized globally as
[01:06:14.700 --> 01:06:20.100]  one of the most impressive police states on Earth. This film conclusively proves the existence
[01:06:20.100 --> 01:06:25.900]  of a secret network of FEMA camps now being expanded nationwide. This documentary exposes
[01:06:25.900 --> 01:06:30.660]  how the continuity of government program has established an all powerful shadow state.
[01:06:30.660 --> 01:06:35.260]  Police state four chronicles the sickening depths to which our republic has fallen. Prepare
[01:06:35.260 --> 01:06:41.140]  to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship, body scanners, sound cameras,
[01:06:41.140 --> 01:06:45.780]  citizen spies, stage terror and cameras on every street corner. It's only the beginning
[01:06:45.780 --> 01:06:51.900]  of the New World Order's hellish plan. The police state isn't coming. It's here. Secure

[01:07:00.340 --> 01:07:05.220]  Coming back on 2012, we ask ourselves how did we ever survive from natural disasters
[01:07:05.220 --> 01:07:09.780]  like Hurricane Sandy and the devastating summer drought to the family hardships brought on
[01:07:09.780 --> 01:07:14.740]  by a disastrous economy. Our hearts go out to those that have lost everything. At E Foods
[01:07:14.740 --> 01:07:18.980]  Direct we hear from customers every day that are fortunate enough to weather life's storm
[01:07:18.980 --> 01:07:23.500]  by having a supply of food on hand. After Hurricane Sandy, Danny from New York City
[01:07:23.500 --> 01:07:29.180]  wrote almost all the grocery stores are closed but I managed to get my E Foods just in time
[01:07:29.180 --> 01:07:33.940]  to be able to help my sister and niece. It is better to be prepared ten years too early
[01:07:33.940 --> 01:07:38.540]  than one day too late. I can warn you but I can't feed you. Heed the warnings and do

[01:08:21.500 --> 01:08:28.500]  You know we're all about solutions on this broadcast. Thank you for joining us. I'm your
[01:08:35.180 --> 01:08:42.100]  host Alex Jones. It is Tuesday the 15th day of January 2013. And if you just tuned in,
[01:08:42.100 --> 01:08:46.860]  the White House is talking about 19 executive orders to restrict the Second Amendment. Joe
[01:08:46.860 --> 01:08:52.460]  Biden headline, White House eyeing 19 executive actions on guns.
[01:08:52.460 --> 01:08:56.820]  Multiple Congress people now are coming out saying that more and more the executive branch
[01:08:56.820 --> 01:09:01.660]  is becoming a dictatorship or a king. New York Assembly Speaker says we are going to
[01:09:01.660 --> 01:09:08.980]  ban assault weapons. That's all semi-autos. Continuing here, just incredible news. Rahm
[01:09:08.980 --> 01:09:12.900]  Emanuel, we haven't played this clip again yet. We're gonna play it later in the hour.
[01:09:12.900 --> 01:09:16.580]  He says hey, the people don't have a right to even debate guns. The police will run things
[01:09:16.580 --> 01:09:22.180]  now. They'll decide. I mean, that's called dictatorship. That's the Chicago mob boss
[01:09:22.180 --> 01:09:23.180]  Emanuel.
[01:09:23.180 --> 01:09:26.280]  Now that is just some of what's coming up. And in about 40 minutes, I'll play a special
[01:09:26.280 --> 01:09:32.300]  report by Aaron showing different sheriffs and police saying they're not gonna be part
[01:09:32.300 --> 01:09:40.180]  of this. So this is a big, big deal. The articles are all up at infowars.com and prisonplanet.com.
[01:09:40.180 --> 01:09:44.940]  But I also wanted to talk about solutions here today. And a few weeks ago, it was one
[01:09:44.940 --> 01:09:47.700]  of the most popular interviews we've done on health.
[01:09:47.700 --> 01:09:52.900]  I wanted to get Theo Ratliff on the broadcast. He just retired. He was able to stay in the
[01:09:52.900 --> 01:09:58.500]  NBA 10 years more than he would have with Dr. Joel Wallach's research. And we promote
[01:09:58.500 --> 01:10:02.300]  all the products that they've developed at infowarshealth.com. When you purchase them
[01:10:02.300 --> 01:10:05.340]  there, it also supports our transmission.
[01:10:05.340 --> 01:10:09.980]  So I've got Theo back on to talk about his experience just with minerals and vitamins
[01:10:09.980 --> 01:10:15.380]  with proprietary systems that have been developed by Dr. Wallach. He's an American former professional
[01:10:15.380 --> 01:10:20.420]  basketball player who played last with the NBA Los Angeles Lakers, primarily a center.
[01:10:20.420 --> 01:10:25.420]  He was an excellent shot blocker who's led the league three times in blocks per game.
[01:10:25.420 --> 01:10:32.140]  As of 2011, he's ranked 18th all time in career blocks and 13th all time for career blocks
[01:10:32.140 --> 01:10:33.140]  per game.
[01:10:33.140 --> 01:10:38.100]  Also a great rebounder. And of course, Ratliff played basketball at Dinopoulos High School
[01:10:38.100 --> 01:10:44.460]  and later graduated from University of Wyoming. And again, he is one of the people that work
[01:10:44.460 --> 01:10:48.900]  with Dr. Wallach and others to develop the product Rebound, the ultimate sports drink
[01:10:48.900 --> 01:10:52.980]  that I know my wife, who's a sports addict, absolutely swears by.
[01:10:52.980 --> 01:10:58.020]  I personally am a big Polymers Plus guy and beyond tangy tangerine. And again, all of
[01:10:58.020 --> 01:11:04.060]  them discounted. Occasionally we do infomercial here amongst the info at infowarshealth.com.
[01:11:04.060 --> 01:11:07.900]  You can sign up there and get free shipping or become a distributor and get discounts
[01:11:07.900 --> 01:11:12.940]  at infowarshealth.com. But the plugging out of the way, there's a cornucopia of things
[01:11:12.940 --> 01:11:18.900]  I wanted to get both these men on the broadcast about, and we'll get Theo to talk about his
[01:11:18.900 --> 01:11:21.320]  experiences and what's happened with him.
[01:11:21.320 --> 01:11:30.540]  But number one, Dr. Wallach, I mean, yesterday we posted an article with Samjay Gupta, how
[01:11:30.540 --> 01:11:36.220]  do you pronounce his name? Gupta, yeah, the brain surgeon on CNN saying almost all these
[01:11:36.220 --> 01:11:40.460]  shooters have been on psychotropics Prozac type drugs. And then the former head of Homeland
[01:11:40.460 --> 01:11:45.140]  Security came out, Governor Ridge, and said we should look at these drugs.
[01:11:45.140 --> 01:11:48.580]  Because in almost every case, these are involved. And of course, for those that don't know who
[01:11:48.580 --> 01:11:55.820]  Dr. Wallach is, I'm not gonna go over his entire giant bio. But he is a doctor of veterinary
[01:11:55.820 --> 01:11:59.340]  medicine that worked for the federal government and did all these autopsies and found out
[01:11:59.340 --> 01:12:01.580]  a lot of stuff because of mineral deficiencies.
[01:12:01.580 --> 01:12:06.300]  He's also got several other doctor's degrees on top of it. Some reason I don't have his
[01:12:06.300 --> 01:12:10.620]  bio here in front of me today, but it's lengthy and it's up at info.warshealth.com. There's
[01:12:10.620 --> 01:12:20.220]  other videos there where that's all introduced. But he joins us now. Dr. Wallach, also a lot
[01:12:20.220 --> 01:12:24.100]  of these behavioral things they admit are the dyes in the processed foods.
[01:12:24.100 --> 01:12:29.180]  And the chemicals that are in the processed foods like McNuggets, they admit have, well,
[01:12:29.180 --> 01:12:33.980]  but basically it is silicone, like you have in breast implants. How do they get away with
[01:12:33.980 --> 01:12:38.220]  this? And as more and more kids drink Cokes all day and eat Snickers bars, and then they're
[01:12:38.220 --> 01:12:42.700]  bound, I mean, if I eat a Snickers bar and then crash an hour later, I wanna beat somebody
[01:12:42.700 --> 01:12:43.700]  up.
[01:12:43.700 --> 01:12:46.980]  I mean, I'm in a horrible mood. If I eat a well-balanced meal, drink some Beyond Tangy
[01:12:46.980 --> 01:12:51.140]  Tangerine, I mean, I feel great. And I can work a lot harder because of Beyond Tangy
[01:12:51.140 --> 01:12:55.940]  Tangerine and the essential fatty acids. The system knows this, but they don't want, they
[01:12:55.940 --> 01:13:00.100]  don't, you were talking in the last segment about what psychiatrists and psychologists
[01:13:00.100 --> 01:13:03.740]  are doing, people that should be locked up.
[01:13:03.740 --> 01:13:08.820]  This woman, she had her guns through background checks, registration, draconian gun laws in
[01:13:08.820 --> 01:13:13.340]  Connecticut. None of these gun laws would have stopped this guy, but they're blaming
[01:13:13.340 --> 01:13:18.780]  gun owners now. What's happening on that front? Then we'll get Theo's take on that and then
[01:13:18.780 --> 01:13:19.780]  give his testimonial.
[01:13:19.780 --> 01:13:26.100]  Sure. Well, certainly gun owners are not default here. Basically, it's the medical system.
[01:13:26.100 --> 01:13:30.860]  You've hit the nail on the head again, Alex, you're just a genius at this kind of stuff.
[01:13:30.860 --> 01:13:34.940]  But it's the medical system that has failed us terribly. There was a wonderful study that
[01:13:34.940 --> 01:13:39.700]  was done in Texas in your state where they looked at two counties, and I get those counties
[01:13:39.700 --> 01:13:44.400]  for you, where they looked at the violent crime, they looked at domestic violence, they
[01:13:44.400 --> 01:13:48.880]  looked at suicides, and two adjoining counties, one of them had an enormous amount of minerals,
[01:13:48.880 --> 01:13:53.500]  particularly natural lithium, which is not a drug, it's really a trace mineral, in the
[01:13:53.500 --> 01:13:58.580]  water compared to the adjacent county that had none in the water. And of course, it was
[01:13:58.580 --> 01:14:02.380]  like night and day. The county that had lots of natural lithium in the drinking water,
[01:14:02.380 --> 01:14:06.740]  the amount of domestic violence, violent crime, rapes, murders, suicides, all that kind of
[01:14:06.740 --> 01:14:11.660]  stuff was nearly like 10% of the neighboring county that didn't have any lithium in the
[01:14:11.660 --> 01:14:12.660]  drinking water.
[01:14:12.660 --> 01:14:17.900]  The nice thing about the Healthy Start Pack, or the Alex Pack, is that the Alex Pack has
[01:14:17.900 --> 01:14:22.020]  a significant amount of natural lithium in there, and that's why you and I are such nice
[01:14:22.020 --> 01:14:28.460]  guys. And if everybody in America would take the 90 essential nutrients, they would avoid
[01:14:28.460 --> 01:14:34.500]  the need for all these terrible psychotropic drugs. The combination of bad food, psychotropic
[01:14:34.500 --> 01:14:41.700]  drugs, and nutritional deficiencies is an explosive mix. And the medical system has
[01:14:41.700 --> 01:14:45.820]  brought all this together for two reasons. Number one, there's insurance, which allows
[01:14:45.820 --> 01:14:52.220]  them to do whatever they want to do for the money. And then they're a protective monopoly.
[01:14:52.220 --> 01:14:57.860]  The medical system is the only monopoly in America. And so they have no competition.
[01:14:57.860 --> 01:15:02.020]  And so this is where I just really applaud you for bringing this stuff to the surface.
[01:15:02.020 --> 01:15:05.420]  Because without you, Alex, this is not going to get out there. It's a combination of bad
[01:15:05.420 --> 01:15:10.140]  food, psychotropic drugs, and nutritional deficiencies. We solve all that. There won't
[01:15:10.140 --> 01:15:15.140]  be any more of our military people coming back home and committing suicide and being
[01:15:15.140 --> 01:15:19.780]  involved in domestic violence. If we do all this, there won't be another mass murder.
[01:15:19.780 --> 01:15:24.220]  And actually, in the book, Rarest Performing Cures, there's several chapters, four, five,
[01:15:24.220 --> 01:15:31.060]  and six, that deal with serial killers and mass murders. And half of them firebomb churches
[01:15:31.060 --> 01:15:36.300]  by throwing Molotov cocktails. They drive cars through malls and run over people. Half
[01:15:36.300 --> 01:15:40.500]  of them don't even use guns. Guns are not the problem. It's a basic trilogy, I would
[01:15:40.500 --> 01:15:45.260]  call it, of bad food, psychotropic drugs, and nutritional deficiencies. And you've hit
[01:15:45.260 --> 01:15:46.260]  the nail on the head once.
[01:15:46.260 --> 01:15:50.500]  Well, you know about the lead conspiracy, which they've proven. I'd love to say guns
[01:15:50.500 --> 01:15:54.900]  is what has made crime drop so much since the 70s and 80s. And that has been part of
[01:15:54.900 --> 01:15:57.740]  it. More guns means less crime in the general population.
[01:15:57.740 --> 01:15:59.300]  That is correct.
[01:15:59.300 --> 01:16:04.900]  But the lead was making people mad as a hatter. And they've got direct correlations of lead,
[01:16:04.900 --> 01:16:09.980]  lower IQ, more violent. So you get the lead out of everything, people start becoming less
[01:16:09.980 --> 01:16:10.980]  violent.
[01:16:10.980 --> 01:16:16.100]  You're exactly right. Of course, toxic metals like lead and mercury, the medical system
[01:16:16.100 --> 01:16:22.860]  actually uses mercury as a treatment. And it's just really sort of backwards. And so
[01:16:22.860 --> 01:16:28.460]  this is where you're educating people on these subjects. It's just genius on your part. Because
[01:16:28.460 --> 01:16:34.460]  if we educate America, the average American is a pretty commonsensical person. And they
[01:16:34.460 --> 01:16:38.060]  will find a way to survive. It's that old song, that old country went through the song,
[01:16:38.060 --> 01:16:44.420]  every boy will survive. And people are going to have their guns. If you depend on the government
[01:16:44.420 --> 01:16:48.540]  taking away guns, they're not going to get all the guns away from the bad guys. I like
[01:16:48.540 --> 01:16:52.740]  the idea. I spent almost 20 years in the military, Alex, and the only way to stop a bad guy with
[01:16:52.740 --> 01:16:59.300]  a gun is have a good guy with a gun. And you point out again, when you have the ability
[01:16:59.300 --> 01:17:04.620]  to carry, you have a permit to carry a concealed weapon, everybody gets real nice. They tip
[01:17:04.620 --> 01:17:09.420]  their hand to the lazies, they open the doors, because you don't know who's carrying a gun.
[01:17:09.420 --> 01:17:11.740]  And so that's a good thing.
[01:17:11.740 --> 01:17:16.780]  Now I want to shift gears into another area. Again, we have Theo Ratliff here, a retired
[01:17:16.780 --> 01:17:24.540]  basketball player, star, just to get people the idea that minerals, vitamins, trace elements
[01:17:24.540 --> 01:17:30.100]  are more powerful than drugs. They're what were actually designed to use. And it's so
[01:17:30.100 --> 01:17:37.420]  much the food we have as adulterated. Shifting gears, Theo, tell folks how you woke up to
[01:17:37.420 --> 01:17:42.220]  this, how you met Dr. Wallach, how it enabled you to stay in the NBA longer, and really
[01:17:42.220 --> 01:17:43.220]  how miraculous.
[01:17:43.220 --> 01:17:48.420]  I mean, this didn't talk, folks, this is true, that the proprietary blends developed by Dr.
[01:17:48.420 --> 01:17:51.660]  Wallach and Young Jebrady were for you, sir.
[01:17:51.660 --> 01:17:57.500]  Well, thanks, Alex, for having me on your show once again. I had a great time last time
[01:17:57.500 --> 01:18:03.220]  we had a chance to speak and, you know, always great to be with the great Dr. Wallach and
[01:18:03.220 --> 01:18:08.720]  all his people over there at Young Jebrady do a great job of just trying to keep people
[01:18:08.720 --> 01:18:11.140]  informed and keep people healthy.
[01:18:11.140 --> 01:18:18.020]  My situation was, you know, I was, I've been playing basketball all my life. And I got
[01:18:18.020 --> 01:18:24.980]  to the point where I had made it to the NBA, doing a great job, taking care of my body,
[01:18:24.980 --> 01:18:30.740]  doing all the necessary things, taking the drugs they give me, the supplement, different
[01:18:30.740 --> 01:18:35.300]  things, and was at a stellar career.
[01:18:35.300 --> 01:18:41.540]  Got to the point where I got all the way to being an All-Star. And as I became an All-Star,
[01:18:41.540 --> 01:18:49.220]  I started breaking things just out of the blue. I broke my hand, had a knee fracture,
[01:18:49.220 --> 01:18:55.080]  had a hip fracture, and all these things was going on. And I tried to condition myself
[01:18:55.080 --> 01:19:01.020]  that bleep, bleep, discipline, no drinking alcohol, taking the right supplements, but
[01:19:01.020 --> 01:19:08.300]  it wasn't the wrong supplements, turned out, and just try to stay focused on my craft as
[01:19:08.300 --> 01:19:14.180]  far as being an NBA player and trying to be the best that I can be.
[01:19:14.180 --> 01:19:20.180]  Then it turns to once I broke my hip, had to go into surgery, felt that my career was
[01:19:20.180 --> 01:19:25.060]  about to be over with because it was hard because I had a labrum tear in my hip and
[01:19:25.060 --> 01:19:35.340]  had congenital arthritis in my knees. So just constantly dealing with that and microfracture
[01:19:35.340 --> 01:19:39.640]  and different things that was just thing after thing after thing.
[01:19:39.640 --> 01:19:45.780]  So I had the honor of once I got here with the Hawks here in Atlanta to meet with the
[01:19:45.780 --> 01:19:53.340]  great Mike Glenn, the Stinger, and the great and late Phil Oliver that introduced me to
[01:19:53.340 --> 01:20:00.700]  Dr. Wylie. And they spoke to me about the mental deficiencies that athletes have and
[01:20:00.700 --> 01:20:05.100]  what I was going through. And the light turned on, the light bulb turned on in my head. It
[01:20:05.100 --> 01:20:11.120]  was like, wow, I've been doing all this stuff and having the best doctors and no one has
[01:20:11.120 --> 01:20:18.180]  ever told me about minerals and how minerals work within your body and athletes and how
[01:20:18.180 --> 01:20:24.020]  we sweat out our memories, not just salt, but all 90 nutrients that we put into our
[01:20:24.020 --> 01:20:25.520]  body, we sweat them out.
[01:20:25.520 --> 01:20:31.660]  And as you deplete them, your body started deteriorating. So you become a lot older as
[01:20:31.660 --> 01:20:36.620]  the more and more you play the game. And that's why you see a lot of people once they retire
[01:20:36.620 --> 01:20:42.660]  not walking with the canes, knees back, hip replacements, blase, blase, go on and on.
[01:20:42.660 --> 01:20:51.780]  So with me being able to get with Phil, Dr. Wylie, and the Stinger, I got on the 90 nutrients,
[01:20:51.780 --> 01:20:59.460]  great program, built my body up, got back to my old self, led the league three years
[01:20:59.460 --> 01:21:05.460]  in a row after I came back and shot blocked, was up for the defensive player of the year.
[01:21:05.460 --> 01:21:12.540]  Two of those years went on to have a stellar career, went on to go in and sign another
[01:21:12.540 --> 01:21:22.540]  $40 million contract. And it was just a blessing, a blessing to basically receive what Dr. Wylie
[01:21:22.540 --> 01:21:27.900]  has prepared within Young's equity in the minerals and also having an opportunity to
[01:21:27.900 --> 01:21:35.660]  formulate an energy drink because I did so well, reformulated the rebound FX energy drink
[01:21:35.660 --> 01:21:40.980]  so I can sustain my energy throughout the game when the guys in the fourth quarter are
[01:21:40.980 --> 01:21:43.540]  dwelling down and their energy is going away.
[01:21:43.540 --> 01:21:49.620]  I'm still at my highest level. And guys, up until this day, until I stopped playing, always
[01:21:49.620 --> 01:21:55.540]  asked, man, you out here 38 years old, how you still running out here with these 20 year
[01:21:55.540 --> 01:22:01.740]  olds? And I tell them every time I take my minerals, I take my supplements, my 90 nutrients
[01:22:01.740 --> 01:22:05.180]  every day, and I'm running on this rebound.
[01:22:05.180 --> 01:22:09.700]  How many of the players have listened to you? Because I've noticed that, and this is real,
[01:22:09.700 --> 01:22:15.100]  this really works. They've done studies with rats decades ago where they know if it's a
[01:22:15.100 --> 01:22:20.300]  super high level, a full spectrum of vitamins, minerals, and trace elements that the rats
[01:22:20.300 --> 01:22:26.540]  live twice as long. In some studies, worms have lived four to five times longer. Anybody
[01:22:26.540 --> 01:22:27.660]  can pull those studies up.
[01:22:27.660 --> 01:22:32.740]  I mean, the system knows this and they know that all these different degenerative diseases
[01:22:32.740 --> 01:22:36.540]  are connected to this. They know that all these new diseases that are happening that
[01:22:36.540 --> 01:22:42.380]  they make up the system. Dr. Wallach, how many doctors out there know this or how many
[01:22:42.380 --> 01:22:46.980]  are just ignorant? Because I was reading about basketball players die so young, doctors die
[01:22:46.980 --> 01:22:51.180]  so young. I guess a lot of them just actually don't know this.
[01:22:51.180 --> 01:22:57.220]  Well they have access to the information Alex, and the problem is they get taught to use
[01:22:57.220 --> 01:23:00.740]  the insurance system. The insurance is probably the worst possible thing for the American
[01:23:00.740 --> 01:23:06.860]  public when it comes to health because there's no law or ethical canon that requires the
[01:23:06.860 --> 01:23:11.380]  medical doctor to cure you if there's a cure available. And so they don't. What they do
[01:23:11.380 --> 01:23:17.060]  is they figure out the best way to get every penny of your insurance money. If they, for
[01:23:17.060 --> 01:23:20.460]  instance, rheumatoid arthritis, if they cure you, they're going to make $300 in office
[01:23:20.460 --> 01:23:24.140]  calls. I can cure rheumatoid arthritis in two weeks. And that sounds bizarre, but it's
[01:23:24.140 --> 01:23:28.380]  an infection with antibiotics. You can kill the bug. It'll take 90 days to rebuild the
[01:23:28.380 --> 01:23:32.820]  damage from rheumatoid arthritis, and it's that simple. But a doctor doesn't have to
[01:23:32.820 --> 01:23:36.580]  do that, even though the cure is available by killing that bug, the mycoplasma bug that
[01:23:36.580 --> 01:23:40.900]  caused the rheumatoid arthritis. They choose to do joint replacements. They use methotrexate,
[01:23:40.900 --> 01:23:47.500]  gold shot injections, and they run up a bill over 25 years of $750,000 versus $300,000.
[01:23:47.500 --> 01:23:50.500]  Well it's well known that, I mean, not just what you develop, but I worked for a large
[01:23:50.500 --> 01:23:55.260]  animal vet off and on in high school. And when winter was coming up, they'd say, now
[01:23:55.260 --> 01:23:59.900]  put them on this mineral mix so you don't lose cattle in the cold weather. You just
[01:23:59.900 --> 01:24:03.900]  give them more of the minerals, I forget which ones they were, and the cows wouldn't freeze
[01:24:03.900 --> 01:24:10.300]  to death. What are those minerals? Well, it'd be selenium is the primary one. And of course
[01:24:10.300 --> 01:24:14.900]  you're looking at calcium is another good one. Magnesium is another good one. And those
[01:24:14.900 --> 01:24:16.540]  would be the three big ones for livestock.
[01:24:16.540 --> 01:24:21.420]  Well see, vets know this because their job is actually to deliver food, beef, and things
[01:24:21.420 --> 01:24:26.900]  to the market and not have it die, not bankrupt the industry. So that's why you get real medicine
[01:24:26.900 --> 01:24:31.100]  there. Theo, I asked you a question and then interrupted going to Dr. Wallach. I mean,
[01:24:31.100 --> 01:24:34.840]  how many people in the NBA around you, where you were about to have to retire, saw you
[01:24:34.840 --> 01:24:39.440]  get what, almost 11 years more because of the minerals? I mean, I would think it would
[01:24:39.440 --> 01:24:41.820]  just sweep the entire industry.
[01:24:41.820 --> 01:24:48.620]  Well that's the problem. I mean, you can tell the story, but you know who control those
[01:24:48.620 --> 01:24:55.580]  guys are the trainers and the doctors. So like I said, I had the best of the doctors
[01:24:55.580 --> 01:25:02.260]  and the best of the trainers, but they have their own way of doing things, their own mechanism
[01:25:02.260 --> 01:25:07.300]  and which how they give supplements and who they listen to.
[01:25:07.300 --> 01:25:11.300]  Some of them do listen, but some of them won't take that leap of faith.
[01:25:11.300 --> 01:25:16.980]  Well what's incredible is Ted Anderson, the owner of the Genesis Network we're on, a couple
[01:25:16.980 --> 01:25:20.740]  of years ago we start promoting the longevity adds good products. It was just a side issue.
[01:25:20.740 --> 01:25:26.020]  Okay, great. You know, vitamins, minerals. I knew it was true. But Ted then went and
[01:25:26.020 --> 01:25:30.740]  he was going to have knee surgery, went to three doctors and he finally got all the products,
[01:25:30.740 --> 01:25:36.100]  the osteo FX, the beyond tangy tangerine, the essential fatty acids, all of it.
[01:25:36.100 --> 01:25:40.340]  And his knees totally better. What happened there, Dr. Wallett?
[01:25:40.340 --> 01:25:44.420]  Well, actually when you look at that, but we can actually regrow cartilage. The medical
[01:25:44.420 --> 01:25:48.620]  system says you cannot regrow cartilage if you have bone to bone arthritis. You're the
[01:25:48.620 --> 01:25:53.340]  perfect candidate for knee replacement, hip replacement, shoulder replacement, when in
[01:25:53.340 --> 01:25:56.700]  fact you can regrow cartilage. It's very simple. You give it the body, the right nutrition,
[01:25:56.700 --> 01:26:02.920]  the body will rebuild itself. We're constructed to do that. And so what I did, I took everything
[01:26:02.920 --> 01:26:08.140]  I learned from the veterinary industry where we don't have insurance. There's no incentive
[01:26:08.140 --> 01:26:12.180]  for a veterinarian to treat you any longer, treat your livestock any longer than he has
[01:26:12.180 --> 01:26:17.300]  to, because you'll figure out a way to do it yourself if, you know, he starts dragging
[01:26:17.300 --> 01:26:23.660]  it out and obviously using it for an ATM machine. Or in the human health industry, there's insurance
[01:26:23.660 --> 01:26:27.140]  either through the government or private. And so the medical doctors try to get every
[01:26:27.140 --> 01:26:30.740]  penny in your insurance policy and they don't feel they're hurting you because insurance
[01:26:30.740 --> 01:26:33.060]  pays is the way they say. This doesn't hurt the patient.
[01:26:33.060 --> 01:26:37.980]  Listen, I know multiple women, I'll just leave it at that, who were not even that old and
[01:26:37.980 --> 01:26:42.960]  had their hair falling out. That's an epidemic now. And one of them even had a thyroid problem
[01:26:42.960 --> 01:26:46.860]  and began taking beyond tangy tangerine, the other products at Infowars Health and their
[01:26:46.860 --> 01:26:52.500]  hair came back. I mean, you know, Wallach, Doc, why are women's hair falling out all
[01:26:52.500 --> 01:26:53.500]  over the place?
[01:26:53.500 --> 01:26:58.080]  Well, their thyroid gland requires all 90 essential nutrients. The medical doctors want
[01:26:58.080 --> 01:27:02.780]  you to believe that all you need is iodine to make your thyroid healthy. And of course,
[01:27:02.780 --> 01:27:08.140]  low thyroid issues can cause loss of hair. But there's a bigger problem with gluten intolerance,
[01:27:08.140 --> 01:27:11.980]  which results oftentimes in low thyroid, because you can't absorb nutrients when you have a
[01:27:11.980 --> 01:27:21.380]  gluten intolerance. And according to Mayo Clinic, a 2009 study, 30%, 100 million Americans
[01:27:21.380 --> 01:27:25.740]  are gluten intolerant. And this is why people are losing their hair, they're getting 14
[01:27:25.740 --> 01:27:29.420]  diseases they didn't have before, because they're all nutritional deficiencies, including
[01:27:29.420 --> 01:27:35.060]  obesity, diabetes, fibromyalgia, which they call it lupus, which they call a autoimmune
[01:27:35.060 --> 01:27:40.420]  disease, it's nonsense. This is all a gluten intolerance. And then you can't absorb your
[01:27:40.420 --> 01:27:44.300]  nutrients and so you wind up with all these nutritional deficiencies diseases.
[01:27:44.300 --> 01:27:49.220]  Absolutely. And folks, I am plugging this and we do fund the Infowar to defend the Second
[01:27:49.220 --> 01:27:53.540]  Amendment and property rights and our sovereignty, promoting things I believe in, whether it's
[01:27:53.540 --> 01:27:58.320]  propure water filters that we have discounted at infowarshop.com, or whether it's come and
[01:27:58.320 --> 01:28:04.220]  take it, pro Second Amendment t-shirts. But you've never heard me promote supplements
[01:28:04.220 --> 01:28:09.460]  like this, because I've never run into anything this incredible. And that's why Dr. Wallach
[01:28:09.460 --> 01:28:14.060]  and Young-Jebedee is one of the biggest companies out there in the last 15, 16 years, because
[01:28:14.060 --> 01:28:16.100]  they know what they're doing.
[01:28:16.100 --> 01:28:20.260]  They've got the researchers, they've got the products. If you wanna call and you're a new

[01:28:45.860 --> 01:28:49.620]  And there's great interviews and videos. You see what happened with Aaron Dykes. He actually
[01:28:49.620 --> 01:28:54.940]  followed the whole program and lost 97 pounds. It looks like a new person. I work 18 hours
[01:28:54.940 --> 01:28:59.900]  a day and I've never been a pill person and a vitamin person. I do about 20% of what I
[01:28:59.900 --> 01:29:02.380]  should and I've just had energy increase.
[01:29:02.380 --> 01:29:06.740]  Unfortunately, it's made me get more aggressive. I'm gonna be honest, the side effect is, it's
[01:29:06.740 --> 01:29:10.060]  like I'm 20 again and almost have road rage and stuff. So I'm gonna be honest with people.
[01:29:10.060 --> 01:29:13.940]  And I'm gonna come back and talk to Theo about that. What happened with him once he got on
[01:29:13.940 --> 01:29:17.980]  this stuff? Cuz I feel like I'm 20 again. Problem is when I was 20, I didn't take anything
[01:29:17.980 --> 01:29:21.380]  off anybody. And I don't know how vitamins and minerals make me more aggressive, they
[01:29:21.380 --> 01:29:22.380]  just do.
[01:29:22.380 --> 01:29:25.260]  Dr. Wallach says that doesn't happen with most people, but I'm gonna be honest. Well,
[01:29:25.260 --> 01:29:29.260]  you've seen the difference last year here on air. And then we're gonna get some more
[01:29:29.260 --> 01:29:34.160]  testimony from Theo. But all the products from Polymer's Plus to Rebound and Beyond

[01:33:46.700 --> 01:33:54.940]  testimony? What what were the sports doctors? And nutritionist giving you versus what you
[01:33:54.940 --> 01:33:57.940]  discovered with Dr Wallach and Young Jeavity.
[01:33:57.940 --> 01:34:05.520]  Well, there are a lot of the synthetic drugs, you know, the you know, the different pain
[01:34:05.520 --> 01:34:10.860]  killers and the different masking agents, basically, you know, it wasn't anything that
[01:34:10.860 --> 01:34:15.800]  was helping you to cure your problem. It was only helping to mask the problem and take
[01:34:15.800 --> 01:34:20.380]  the pain away. So you can go out there, you can play ball, but then you go and sit down.
[01:34:20.380 --> 01:34:27.500]  You can't walk. So that's not good. So we're with the product, with the Gluco gel and the
[01:34:27.500 --> 01:34:34.880]  osteo FX and all these different natural products is actually absorbing into your body and helping
[01:34:34.880 --> 01:34:36.020]  to heal your body.
[01:34:36.020 --> 01:34:42.740]  Like Dr Wallach said, it's healing. It's not just creating a temporary heal. It's creating
[01:34:42.740 --> 01:34:47.540]  a lifetime here. So you don't have, I don't have any issues. I don't have back issues.
[01:34:47.540 --> 01:34:51.460]  I don't have any of that stuff right now. Whereas most guys, when they retire, they
[01:34:51.460 --> 01:34:56.180]  got all kind of different problems going on because they don't have the proper nutrients
[01:34:56.180 --> 01:34:57.180]  more in their bodies.
[01:34:57.180 --> 01:35:03.780]  And now I'm having the opportunity to be in front of a lot of the retired guys because
[01:35:03.780 --> 01:35:11.420]  I'm one of those guys and I'm going to make it my mission to try to explain to guys about
[01:35:11.420 --> 01:35:17.660]  what this product is and what it's about and how it changed my life and give my testimony
[01:35:17.660 --> 01:35:21.860]  to them in order to help them in their future.
[01:35:21.860 --> 01:35:26.700]  Because it's not over with. A lot of people think, okay, just because I got to get this
[01:35:26.700 --> 01:35:31.460]  knee replacement and I'm on bone on bone that I'm going to have to live with this for the
[01:35:31.460 --> 01:35:37.700]  rest of my life. But it don't have to be that way. You just have to use the proper things
[01:35:37.700 --> 01:35:45.340]  in your body to help rebuild that correlation and maintain that bone density and in the
[01:35:45.340 --> 01:35:47.700]  longevity product is the product that does that.
[01:35:47.700 --> 01:35:52.460]  By the way, it's not just Dr. Wallach pioneering this and talking about it. Dr. Blalock, who's
[01:35:52.460 --> 01:35:56.860]  a top retired brain surgeon, he talks about and writes about, and he's got studies that
[01:35:56.860 --> 01:36:01.700]  are published, many of them and a lot of the terms he's developed like excitotoxin are
[01:36:01.700 --> 01:36:04.940]  now mainline terms used in the scientific community.
[01:36:04.940 --> 01:36:11.540]  He says so many problems are just deficiencies and their chronic irritation, inflammation
[01:36:11.540 --> 01:36:18.140]  from the additives. And we think of fancy drugs as something special, but it's almost
[01:36:18.140 --> 01:36:22.860]  like white bread in the 40s and 50s. White bread came out, everybody saw it as fancy.
[01:36:22.860 --> 01:36:28.500]  When it wasn't even bread, it was bleached poison. But it's high tech, it's white bread.
[01:36:28.500 --> 01:36:32.680]  That's almost what these drugs are like. When meanwhile, the real nutrients, it's what we
[01:36:32.680 --> 01:36:38.960]  eat. It's what we're designed for. That's what we really need. And the soils are so
[01:36:38.960 --> 01:36:41.300]  depleted that we're just not getting what we need.
[01:36:41.300 --> 01:36:46.300]  And that was my question for Dr. Wallach. Why did it make me feel, I mean, I was always
[01:36:46.300 --> 01:36:49.860]  naturally kind of an aggressive guy. I'm angry some of the time and stuff, but I mean, not
[01:36:49.860 --> 01:36:55.540]  in a bad way. Why would I take beyond tany tangerine, essential fatty acids, and things
[01:36:55.540 --> 01:36:57.060]  like rebound and stuff?
[01:36:57.060 --> 01:37:01.420]  Why does it make me bounce off the walls and have so much more energy?
[01:37:01.420 --> 01:37:09.300]  Well, because your testicles, Alex, God love them, require all 90 essential nutrients to
[01:37:09.300 --> 01:37:13.940]  make testosterone. So if you're eating four to six eggs a day, you're taking the Alex
[01:37:13.940 --> 01:37:18.920]  pack twice a day because you're a big guy, you're going to produce enough testosterone
[01:37:18.920 --> 01:37:23.540]  to make an elephant happy. And so you don't need to do any doping here. You don't need
[01:37:23.540 --> 01:37:27.980]  to take testosterone patches and all that kind of stuff. You just give your body what
[01:37:27.980 --> 01:37:32.380]  it needs and you'll make enough testosterone that you will be a man's man. And that's what's
[01:37:32.380 --> 01:37:36.540]  happening to you. You've noticed that. And this is why the Olympic athletes, we have
[01:37:36.540 --> 01:37:44.220]  Olympic athletes that have four gold medals. We have one gal, Delicia Jones. She is a woman's
[01:37:44.220 --> 01:37:49.660]  woman, but women like testosterone too, because that's what gives them libido. When a woman
[01:37:49.660 --> 01:37:53.680]  goes for menopause, she stops making not only estrogen and progesterone, but she also stops
[01:37:53.680 --> 01:37:59.460]  making testosterone. And so you get these aggressive women basketball players or football
[01:37:59.460 --> 01:38:04.220]  players or soccer players and they have lots of testosterone because they're eating four
[01:38:04.220 --> 01:38:08.660]  to six eggs a day, they're taking the Alex pack twice a day, and they wind up with gold
[01:38:08.660 --> 01:38:14.500]  medals because they have enough testosterone for muscle strength, for energy, stamina,
[01:38:14.500 --> 01:38:18.980]  and the proper amount of aggression. Women, if you look at who does the killing in the
[01:38:18.980 --> 01:38:25.180]  animal world, it's the female lion. The lioness does the killing. The male just sort of lays
[01:38:25.180 --> 01:38:30.460]  there, looks beautiful. And the female does most of the killing. And so that's the way
[01:38:30.460 --> 01:38:35.300]  it is with humans too. Women should be very aggressive, but then there's times for them
[01:38:35.300 --> 01:38:39.260]  to be very feminine and wear long gowns and put on their makeup. And then there's time
[01:38:39.260 --> 01:38:43.660]  for them to be aggressive, to save their kids. And of course, right now, women aren't supposed
[01:38:43.660 --> 01:38:48.680]  to be feigning and all domesticated. That's a modern affectation of control. Going back
[01:38:48.680 --> 01:38:54.860]  to Theo, what did you notice? Go back in the timeframe of when you were breaking down,
[01:38:54.860 --> 01:38:56.940]  you were gonna have to get out.
[01:38:56.940 --> 01:39:00.580]  It was about 10 years, right, that the products helped you continue. Describe what happened
[01:39:00.580 --> 01:39:05.980]  with your focus. I mean, was it just your body or did you experience getting the old
[01:39:05.980 --> 01:39:06.980]  stamina back?
[01:39:06.980 --> 01:39:14.700]  Yeah, I mean, a lot of the times, before I started taking the product, if I came home
[01:39:14.700 --> 01:39:20.740]  from practice, it was immediately, I gotta go take a nap. And just trying to stay up
[01:39:20.740 --> 01:39:26.500]  and read a book, different things in nature, it was pretty much impossible without me just
[01:39:26.500 --> 01:39:29.500]  falling asleep while reading.
[01:39:29.500 --> 01:39:38.180]  But once I started taking the minerals and the rebound effects, everything just became
[01:39:38.180 --> 01:39:45.020]  clear. It became more clear as far as when I'm reading, understanding, being able to
[01:39:45.020 --> 01:39:51.100]  maintain your focus. And that's what I liked about it a lot because when you're tired,
[01:39:51.100 --> 01:39:52.100]  you lose focus.
[01:39:52.100 --> 01:39:56.900]  And when you're playing in the game, the most critical time in a basketball game is the
[01:39:56.900 --> 01:40:03.260]  last four or five minutes of the game. And if you look at most NBA games, the teams that
[01:40:03.260 --> 01:40:12.060]  have that better focus and that better game plan, usually win those games. And if you're
[01:40:12.060 --> 01:40:20.020]  tired, you're gonna lose that focus, which helps, which attributes to you losing games.
[01:40:20.020 --> 01:40:25.140]  And that's something that it did for me as far as on the basketball court. Like I said,
[01:40:25.140 --> 01:40:31.980]  as far as my personal life and being able to focus and concentrate on doing deals and
[01:40:31.980 --> 01:40:36.500]  being able to sit down, read prospectus and different things of that nature, which people
[01:40:36.500 --> 01:40:37.500]  consider boring.
[01:40:37.500 --> 01:40:44.740]  I was able to do it and really focus in on it and help propel my entrepreneurial side
[01:40:44.740 --> 01:40:45.740]  at the same time.
[01:40:45.740 --> 01:40:51.100]  That's right, you're involved in a whole bunch of stuff and very successful. I mean, how
[01:40:51.100 --> 01:40:54.940]  much money does you total make being able to stay in the NBA 10 more years?
[01:40:54.940 --> 01:41:06.100]  Well, like I said, I signed another $40 million contract, so I hit the lottery again, so to
[01:41:06.100 --> 01:41:07.100]  speak.
[01:41:07.100 --> 01:41:14.380]  Well, that's just amazing. And again, the other stories we see, but I mean, Dr. Wallach
[01:41:14.380 --> 01:41:19.940]  and also Theo, do the sports medicine people not know about this? Or are they so set that
[01:41:19.940 --> 01:41:22.220]  their thing is right, they won't look at it?
[01:41:22.220 --> 01:41:26.660]  Or is there an evil motive? Cuz I can't imagine the average doctor, I mean, they're dying
[01:41:26.660 --> 01:41:30.020]  young too. I mean, I just think they're ignorant most of them.
[01:41:30.020 --> 01:41:35.720]  Well, I mean, you're talking about people that's going to these high level schools,
[01:41:35.720 --> 01:41:42.740]  and they're seeing patients every single day. And they did all these different studies on
[01:41:42.740 --> 01:41:50.500]  what creates, what helps what person that has this disease and that disease.
[01:41:50.500 --> 01:41:56.540]  So when you're speaking of that, when you don't blow, come off the street. They've never
[01:41:56.540 --> 01:42:03.460]  been to medical school or anything to be able to come and tell them something that's better
[01:42:03.460 --> 01:42:08.740]  for their patient. Nine times out of ten, they really not gonna listen.
[01:42:08.740 --> 01:42:13.700]  Incredible, I think that's absolutely what's happening. Dr. Wallach, your take on that.
[01:42:13.700 --> 01:42:18.780]  Okay, well, basically, in 14 years of medical school, Alex, the medical doctors do not get
[01:42:18.780 --> 01:42:24.380]  30 minutes of nutritional training. And so it's not a piece of their language, it's not
[01:42:24.380 --> 01:42:29.340]  something they recognize as being functional. In their brains, they think if you eat variety
[01:42:29.340 --> 01:42:33.740]  and put four different colors on your plate, that you're doing okay. They have no earthly
[01:42:33.740 --> 01:42:40.060]  idea that nutrition can help your body maintain itself. And so when you have a high performance
[01:42:40.060 --> 01:42:44.980]  athlete or somebody who's doing a lot of physical work, they're looking at you down the line
[01:42:44.980 --> 01:42:51.060]  as a knee replacement, a hip replacement, a disc surgery in your back, a shoulder surgery.
[01:42:51.060 --> 01:42:56.100]  And this is what they look at. And so their whole focus is on surgery, surgery, surgery,
[01:42:56.100 --> 01:42:57.100]  surgery.
[01:42:57.100 --> 01:43:01.260]  Every little school kid gets taught, I hope they still get taught, your skin goes away
[01:43:01.260 --> 01:43:04.820]  every 28 days and it replaces itself. But the same thing is true with your cartilage,
[01:43:04.820 --> 01:43:08.780]  your ligaments, your tendons, your bones, your liver, your kidneys, your heart, your
[01:43:08.780 --> 01:43:13.860]  lungs, your muscles, skin, everything goes away. And if you don't have the raw materials
[01:43:13.860 --> 01:43:18.700]  to replace it, then you get disease. And of course, the more high performance you are,
[01:43:18.700 --> 01:43:23.100]  like an athlete, as Theo pointed out, you're sweating out these nutrients. And so you actually
[01:43:23.100 --> 01:43:29.540]  break down faster than a librarian. For instance, there's hundreds of librarians every year
[01:43:29.540 --> 01:43:35.500]  who reach 100 years of age. The average lifespan of a professional athlete in America is 62.
[01:43:35.500 --> 01:43:39.260]  A football player, the average professional football player in America, lives to be 51.
[01:43:39.260 --> 01:43:42.980]  With the exception of a couple of black guys in the old Negro baseball league days, there's
[01:43:42.980 --> 01:43:47.380]  never been a professional athlete ever lived to be 100. The people who you find living
[01:43:47.380 --> 01:43:52.620]  to be 100 are these little old ladies living out in the swamps Louisiana with no utilities,
[01:43:52.620 --> 01:43:58.580]  no education, never see a doctor, and they live to be 114. And librarians, they don't
[01:43:58.580 --> 01:44:03.500]  have knee replacements, and they live to be 100. And they don't exercise. They sit on
[01:44:03.500 --> 01:44:07.380]  a chair and they work on the computer all day in an air conditioned place. They don't
[01:44:07.380 --> 01:44:12.140]  sweat. And it's not because of genetics, it's because they don't need as many nutrients
[01:44:12.140 --> 01:44:18.580]  to maintain themselves as somebody who's a high performance athlete like a guy like Theo.
[01:44:18.580 --> 01:44:24.420]  Just amazing. And again, it's common sense that you need more minerals and vitamins.
[01:44:24.420 --> 01:44:28.100]  And it's common sense that if you don't get vitamin C, you get scurvy and your skin rots
[01:44:28.100 --> 01:44:33.540]  off. I mean, it's common sense, but it's hiding there just in plain view in front of everyone.
[01:44:33.540 --> 01:44:39.300]  And I can say this more than anything about the longevity products, that the more I take
[01:44:39.300 --> 01:44:43.260]  of them, the better I feel. I'm trying to habitualize myself like friends and family
[01:44:43.260 --> 01:44:46.580]  have done to take it all, but I've just never been good at that.
[01:44:46.580 --> 01:44:51.340]  But I can tell you the big thing is just energy. And it's just been amazing. And I hope listeners
[01:44:51.340 --> 01:44:56.780]  will check out infowarshealth.com. They're on the bottom of the site. We also have the

[01:45:20.740 --> 01:45:26.460]  Gentlemen, thank you so much for spending time with us today. I'm sorry, I rescheduled
[01:45:26.460 --> 01:45:32.260]  last week when I had to fly up to New York to be on CNN. And hopefully we can get Theo
[01:45:32.260 --> 01:45:37.500]  back sometime just to tell some NBA stories. But I'll say this in closing. Theo, a couple
[01:45:37.500 --> 01:45:44.220]  times when I was out in Hollywood, I got taken to parties and saw a lot of retired NBA players,
[01:45:44.220 --> 01:45:45.780]  some of them very famous.
[01:45:45.780 --> 01:45:49.300]  And I noticed that when you see them on ESPN, they're not hobbling with canes. But these
[01:45:49.300 --> 01:45:52.900]  are guys that weren't even that old and all of them were kind of hobbling and you could
[01:45:52.900 --> 01:45:57.220]  tell were in pain. And so what you were saying, I didn't know that. They kind of cover that
[01:45:57.220 --> 01:46:02.660]  up. You're on the inside of this. How many of these guys that are only 45, 50, can't
[01:46:02.660 --> 01:46:03.660]  even walk?
[01:46:03.660 --> 01:46:10.100]  There's a lot. I mean, you wouldn't believe the numbers because a lot of guys end up retiring
[01:46:10.100 --> 01:46:17.460]  early because of an injury. So that injury doesn't rehabilitate themselves just because
[01:46:17.460 --> 01:46:23.360]  they retire. And they end up, like I said, with the knee replacements, the hip replacements
[01:46:23.360 --> 01:46:31.380]  and different joint diseases. So that's why it's my mission to go and make sure I at least
[01:46:31.380 --> 01:46:35.420]  disseminate the information and try to get some of these guys healthy.
[01:46:35.420 --> 01:46:40.620]  All right, well, thank you so much for spending time with us. And I really appreciate it.
[01:46:40.620 --> 01:46:45.900]  We look forward to having you guys back on. Find out more about Rebound FX in the liquid
[01:46:45.900 --> 01:46:51.620]  and the powder available at mfolwarshealth.com. Theo and Dr. Wallach, thank you so much, gentlemen.
[01:46:51.620 --> 01:46:54.180]  All right. Thank you. Super job.
[01:46:54.180 --> 01:46:59.020]  Thank you, sir. God bless you. Okay. Again, I had those guys shut up last week. We have
[01:46:59.020 --> 01:47:02.680]  somebody off from Young Jevity at least once a month. I really believe in it. And it supports
[01:47:02.680 --> 01:47:06.260]  the info war. We're not like the government that takes your tax money and then gives it
[01:47:06.260 --> 01:47:16.340]  to MSNBC or CNN or the governments of Bahrain giving money to folks over at CNN.
[01:47:16.340 --> 01:47:21.600]  That's come out with Amber Lyon. All of that. We're gonna open the phones up in the third
[01:47:21.600 --> 01:47:29.020]  hour. I'm gonna be honest with you. I am so shell shocked by the Second Amendment stuff
[01:47:29.020 --> 01:47:34.000]  happening and all coming true, nightmare coming true that I was glad we had that health interview
[01:47:34.000 --> 01:47:35.000]  shut up.
[01:47:35.000 --> 01:47:39.020]  Normally, I would have just canceled it again because the news is so serious. I was glad
[01:47:39.020 --> 01:47:45.660]  to become distracted with something I can do like go jog or take a vitamin drink or
[01:47:45.660 --> 01:47:51.900]  something and try to help people because I am just completely freaked out. And I know
[01:47:51.900 --> 01:47:55.380]  you're freaked out too.
[01:47:55.380 --> 01:47:58.140]  It's just that sinking feeling. It's like I told you three months ago, I said I got
[01:47:58.140 --> 01:48:01.780]  a bad feeling and I've never had one like this. And of course, it's intellectual too
[01:48:01.780 --> 01:48:05.820]  with all the political information I had. I've been all over the map with you guys with
[01:48:05.820 --> 01:48:07.420]  the clips of what's coming up next.
[01:48:07.420 --> 01:48:12.080]  We're gonna come back from break and play a very important report Aaron Dykes did that's
[01:48:12.080 --> 01:48:16.860]  just unbelievably important. Sheriff says teachers should be armed. Second Amendment
[01:48:16.860 --> 01:48:20.380]  shall not be infringed. We're gonna play that but right now before we go to break cuz it
[01:48:20.380 --> 01:48:23.140]  ties into the sheriff saying the same thing basically.
[01:48:23.140 --> 01:48:33.600]  Here's Judge Head over one of the big West Texas towns. Lubbock, this is before the election
[01:48:33.600 --> 01:48:40.600]  saying look, they're gonna try gun confiscation. There's gonna be a 1776 and I need more deputies
[01:48:40.600 --> 01:48:42.180]  to get ready for this.
[01:48:42.180 --> 01:48:45.820]  We're not gonna turn the guns in and then suddenly there's sheriffs and police chiefs
[01:48:45.820 --> 01:48:50.300]  all over the country and city councils who are now moving in this direction. In fact,
[01:48:50.300 --> 01:48:54.540]  so many of these are coming in. I can't even keep track of them right now. And you watch
[01:48:54.540 --> 01:48:57.260]  the sheriff and he starts to cry.
[01:48:57.260 --> 01:49:01.940]  You can hear him cuz he realizes what he's committing to. It's the sadness. He says I'm
[01:49:01.940 --> 01:49:11.980]  so sad. It's not a fear of Obama. It's very sad. And that's the sound I feel like I should
[01:49:11.980 --> 01:49:18.140]  make just. Man, they're gonna take everything. The fact they're going after the guns that
[01:49:18.140 --> 01:49:21.620]  means they mean business.
[01:49:21.620 --> 01:49:25.300]  It's time to pray. I'm gonna tell you right now because listen, they're gonna push till
[01:49:25.300 --> 01:49:31.280]  you resist. They want you to resist. There's no way out of this. You understand that? There's
[01:49:31.280 --> 01:49:39.180]  no way out. The only hope we've got is breaking the trance, breaking the spell, getting angry.
[01:49:39.180 --> 01:49:42.820]  Now here's Judge Head. We come back, I'll play the other sheriff and others that are
[01:49:42.820 --> 01:49:43.820]  coming out.
[01:49:43.820 --> 01:49:48.100]  And I was watching this clip last night. I watched this morning, this sheriff. And you
[01:49:48.100 --> 01:49:52.060]  can hear him getting chills. You hear him when he's talking and go, and it's not fear.
[01:49:52.060 --> 01:49:57.100]  It's man, because everybody knows in their gut. That's why everybody's out buying 10
[01:49:57.100 --> 01:50:01.820]  million guns a month right now. But you hear the, let's go to Judge Head. Here it is.
[01:50:01.820 --> 01:50:06.880]  He is gonna try to hand over the sovereignty of the United States to the UN. Okay, what's
[01:50:06.880 --> 01:50:10.140]  gonna happen when that happens? I'm thinking worst case scenario.
[01:50:10.140 --> 01:50:11.140]  Right, right.
[01:50:11.140 --> 01:50:17.020]  Civil unrest, civil disobedience, civil war, maybe. And we're not talking just a few riots
[01:50:17.020 --> 01:50:23.940]  here and demonstrations. We're talking Lexington, Concord, take up arms and get rid of the guy.
[01:50:23.940 --> 01:50:28.620]  Okay, now what's gonna happen if we do that? If the public decides to do that? He's gonna
[01:50:28.620 --> 01:50:34.820]  send in UN troops. I don't want them in Lubbock County. Okay, so I'm gonna stand in front
[01:50:34.820 --> 01:50:39.300]  of their armored personnel carriers and say, you're not coming in here. And the sheriff,
[01:50:39.300 --> 01:50:42.300]  I've already asked him, I said, you're gonna back me? He said, yeah, I'll back you. Well,
[01:50:42.300 --> 01:50:43.860]  I don't want a bunch of rookies back there.
[01:50:43.860 --> 01:50:44.860]  All right.
[01:50:44.860 --> 01:50:45.860]  True.
[01:50:45.860 --> 01:50:46.860]  I want trained.
[01:50:46.860 --> 01:50:50.420]  Full clip is up at infowars.com, so they're having to get ready. People say that guy's
[01:50:50.420 --> 01:50:54.060]  crazy and never happened. No, that's the guy who knows what's going on. That's an American
[01:50:54.060 --> 01:50:58.980]  right there. You either capitulate to the globalist and say, I give up, occupy us, carry
[01:50:58.980 --> 01:51:01.220]  on a Gena 21 or resist.
[01:51:01.220 --> 01:51:07.220]  Hey there, Frank Bates here. Have you heard about the weird device that could wipe out
[01:51:07.220 --> 01:51:13.300]  280 million Americans? This is really scary stuff. Defense experts warn that this odd
[01:51:13.300 --> 01:51:18.580]  device poses the gravest threat we've ever known. In fact, just a few weeks ago, former
[01:51:18.580 --> 01:51:22.660]  speaker of the house Newt Gingrich wrote an op-ed piece for the Washington Post warning
[01:51:22.660 --> 01:51:27.500]  about this deadly threat. I can't believe that more people aren't talking about this.
[01:51:27.500 --> 01:51:32.200]  It may be because the liberals and the government are trying to cover it up. That's why my friend
[01:51:32.200 --> 01:51:38.300]  just created a free video at weirddevice.com that exposes this threat and blows the doors
[01:51:38.300 --> 01:51:43.980]  off the conspiracy. Go watch the shocking video at weirddevice.com right now to discover
[01:51:43.980 --> 01:51:49.180]  exactly what it is, plus discover the number one way you and your family can survive this
[01:51:49.180 --> 01:51:54.420]  deadly attack. I'm not sure how long this video will be online, so go to weirddevice.com
[01:51:54.420 --> 01:51:58.060]  before it's gone forever. Again, that's weirddevice.com.
[01:51:58.060 --> 01:52:07.280]  You land in Buenos Aires, then a shuttle to Santa Rosa, where a nicely furnished cabin
[01:52:07.280 --> 01:52:13.400]  with all amenities, Wi-Fi, executive food and wine, and laundry service awaits. After

[01:53:58.900 --> 01:54:12.540]  My friends, do you want to be conquered? You want to be run by fire and ruthless, eugenicist
[01:54:12.540 --> 01:54:18.180]  based banks who've wrecked every other country they dominate as a tool of control? Well,
[01:54:18.180 --> 01:54:22.820]  you're going to get what you want. Everybody else better get real aggressive. Just like
[01:54:22.820 --> 01:54:28.620]  I said a couple months ago when I said 1776, part two, we got to get politically aggressive.
[01:54:28.620 --> 01:54:34.060]  We got to move for secession because the federal government's been taken over. Succede to re-upload
[01:54:34.060 --> 01:54:39.500]  the republic, not to get rid of the republic. They're going to act like Obama used the George
[01:54:39.500 --> 01:54:45.940]  Washington rolled into Lincoln and is there to save us.
[01:54:45.940 --> 01:54:49.300]  That's how they're billing him and now they're officially saying that. He's going to take
[01:54:49.300 --> 01:54:53.860]  your guns. Lincoln was a dictator. Obama can do it. That's the sales pitch and they're
[01:54:53.860 --> 01:54:57.760]  trying to see if he can get away with it right now. They want to take this country over right
[01:54:57.760 --> 01:55:03.380]  now. This is the biggest news since 1776. What's happening right now? They're going
[01:55:03.380 --> 01:55:04.380]  for broke, okay?
[01:55:04.380 --> 01:55:07.820]  Let's go ahead and go to Aaron Dykes special report on this. Here it is.
[01:55:07.820 --> 01:55:12.780]  Aaron Dykes for infowars.com. Now we've already seen a big pushback against the system's gun
[01:55:12.780 --> 01:55:17.340]  control agenda. Now we're hearing from Rahm Emanuel that if you're not in law enforcement,
[01:55:17.340 --> 01:55:21.500]  if you're not a police officer, you need to shut your mouth and not weigh in on the Second
[01:55:21.500 --> 01:55:22.500]  Amendment.
[01:55:22.500 --> 01:55:26.860]  Put the police chief in the law enforcement community front and center. Everybody else
[01:55:26.860 --> 01:55:31.500]  from politician to whatever, take a back seat because the police chiefs have a credibility
[01:55:31.500 --> 01:55:33.300]  and authority and a voice on this.
[01:55:33.300 --> 01:55:36.660]  First of all, we're not going to give up our First Amendment as you try to destroy the
[01:55:36.660 --> 01:55:40.340]  Second Amendment. We will never give up our First Amendment. We will never give up our
[01:55:40.340 --> 01:55:44.740]  Second Amendment. They're inalienable rights. They are not to be infringed. We're not going
[01:55:44.740 --> 01:55:49.380]  to be lectured to by the mayor of the murder capital of the world, Chicago, as you try
[01:55:49.380 --> 01:55:54.140]  to get these insane policies passed all around the country. But second of all, you haven't
[01:55:54.140 --> 01:55:58.300]  been listening to law enforcement who've been speaking up across the country saying we will
[01:55:58.300 --> 01:55:59.460]  not infringe.
[01:55:59.460 --> 01:56:03.960]  We will not enforce any unconstitutional gun laws. We heard a week and a half, two weeks
[01:56:03.960 --> 01:56:08.340]  ago from the Pennsylvania police chief of the small town who's introducing a Second
[01:56:08.340 --> 01:56:12.340]  Amendment defense ordinance to protect and keep the Second Amendment and saying they're
[01:56:12.340 --> 01:56:17.860]  going to nullify any laws which are unconstitutional and otherwise trying to infringe. We've seen
[01:56:17.860 --> 01:56:23.100]  Wyoming lawmakers and others trying to introduce legislation upholding the Second Amendment
[01:56:23.100 --> 01:56:27.340]  and reminding and sending the message back to Washington that they too will not be in
[01:56:27.340 --> 01:56:30.780]  part of infringing on the Second Amendment.
[01:56:30.780 --> 01:56:35.900]  And that's really what we need. We need people recognizing their legal jurisdiction at the
[01:56:35.900 --> 01:56:40.700]  state, local and county level and saying no, we're not going to cooperate with the feds.
[01:56:40.700 --> 01:56:45.500]  We will not participate in destroying our God given and guaranteed rights. Now we're
[01:56:45.500 --> 01:56:50.880]  hearing from Sheriff Denny Payman of Jackson County, Kentucky. He too is saying he will
[01:56:50.880 --> 01:56:55.480]  not enforce federal gun grabbing laws. He's standing up for his oath. He's recognizing
[01:56:55.480 --> 01:57:01.420]  the fact that he is the highest law enforcement officer in his jurisdiction at the county
[01:57:01.420 --> 01:57:06.520]  level and that even the feds do not have higher jurisdiction there and cannot tell him what
[01:57:06.520 --> 01:57:07.520]  to do.
[01:57:07.520 --> 01:57:12.580]  If Obama passes this, it doesn't matter what he passes. The sheriff has more power than
[01:57:12.580 --> 01:57:17.660]  the federal people. They need to go back and they study that. We're a commonwealth. I can
[01:57:17.660 --> 01:57:21.180]  ask the federal people to leave. They have to leave. I can ask state people to leave.
[01:57:21.180 --> 01:57:22.180]  They have to leave.
[01:57:22.180 --> 01:57:27.200]  And he's being asked by journalists how he's going to participate in confiscating guns
[01:57:27.200 --> 01:57:28.200]  that dangerous task.
[01:57:28.200 --> 01:57:32.540]  You're never going to pull a gun from Jackson County. I can't get their equipment to help
[01:57:32.540 --> 01:57:36.540]  those people. My best help to them is to let them keep their firearm. I can't do it for
[01:57:36.540 --> 01:57:41.020]  the other counties. I can't stand up for them, but I can't stand up for my people. And you
[01:57:41.020 --> 01:57:44.060]  know, I was one of the first people to say, I think they need to arm school teachers.
[01:57:44.060 --> 01:57:48.040]  Not all of them, but they need, there's somebody that needs to have a weapon.
[01:57:48.040 --> 01:57:52.020]  And it's so clear what's going on that this sheriff is saying the founding fathers will
[01:57:52.020 --> 01:57:53.980]  be turning over in their graves.
[01:57:53.980 --> 01:57:57.980]  Second amendment, they said very clear and our forefathers made that very clear. Otherwise
[01:57:57.980 --> 01:58:01.980]  they would have been so high on the amendment. It would have been down the list someplace
[01:58:01.980 --> 01:58:07.980]  to me. And I would be ashamed if one of them was in this room right now and having to listen
[01:58:07.980 --> 01:58:12.300]  to what we're having to talk about. I would be ashamed to have them sit here and listen
[01:58:12.300 --> 01:58:18.540]  to all the people that have given their lives for this right for us. And we just give it
[01:58:18.540 --> 01:58:21.360]  up so flippantly just because somebody says so.
[01:58:21.360 --> 01:58:26.140]  First of all, you shouldn't want to participate in destroying the things that make this country
[01:58:26.140 --> 01:58:29.580]  great. Our country was different. That's why the bill of rights and the constitution gave
[01:58:29.580 --> 01:58:35.700]  us the quote 5,000 year leap. Second of all, this whole time, that full report is up at

[02:00:37.780 --> 02:00:45.540]  Congress, everybody to circulate their own bill of particulars dealing with the crimes
[02:00:45.540 --> 02:00:56.060]  of this administration and impeachable offenses. We need to issue a petition for the executive
[02:00:56.060 --> 02:01:00.940]  wannabe dictator to be impeached.
[02:01:00.940 --> 02:01:08.820]  Let's not talk about starting impeachment proceedings. We need to list the bill of impeachment.
[02:01:08.820 --> 02:01:12.860]  That's what we'll call it at mfullawards.com with our points in case people don't know
[02:01:12.860 --> 02:01:18.220]  all the stuff this president's done. I was sitting here thinking during the last few
[02:01:18.220 --> 02:01:27.380]  hours during the breaks about all the different things, all the different things that Obama
[02:01:27.380 --> 02:01:31.940]  has done that are completely unconstitutional.
[02:01:31.940 --> 02:01:36.180]  The secret orders on cyber security and telling Congress they can't see him. Saying our troops
[02:01:36.180 --> 02:01:43.060]  are under UN control and that Congress has no authority over that. Now saying you'll
[02:01:43.060 --> 02:01:48.660]  sign executive orders on guns, lying to Congress, fast and furious. Congress not doing anything
[02:01:48.660 --> 02:01:54.140]  about it. I know Congress is bad, but it's their job to impeach this guy. Do it, start
[02:01:54.140 --> 02:01:57.540]  it now. This is super creepy.
[02:01:57.540 --> 02:02:02.580]  You've got an armed to the teeth, crazy government, working for a bunch of foreign banks, training
[02:02:02.580 --> 02:02:09.660]  at all these military drills to kill role players and John Deere hats and overalls.
[02:02:09.660 --> 02:02:12.900]  And they practice killing grandpa, folks. I've been to the drills, I've shot video,
[02:02:12.900 --> 02:02:17.860]  you've seen them. Troops have called in, yeah, no, we practice killing rural people. They
[02:02:17.860 --> 02:02:22.500]  practice killing my granddaddy. They practice killing old men on tractors.
[02:02:22.500 --> 02:02:26.660]  They know who isn't gonna go along with this. There's not many Americans left, I guess.
[02:02:26.660 --> 02:02:32.180]  Go wipe out old country people. Bunch of sick traders, man, I cannot believe we've gotten
[02:02:32.180 --> 02:02:41.020]  this low in this country. And I mean, is there nothing we won't put up with? Secret arrest,
[02:02:41.020 --> 02:02:44.660]  warrantless wiretapping, torture, the government, we're running Al-Qaeda.
[02:02:44.660 --> 02:02:48.960]  That's another thing, I wanna start impeachment over the Libya and Syria attacks when Congress
[02:02:48.960 --> 02:02:53.340]  said don't do it and the president did it. And then impeachment for our government giving
[02:02:53.340 --> 02:03:01.820]  weapons to Al-Qaeda, that's the big one. Now arming Al-Qaeda, arming Al-Qaeda. Let's go,
[02:03:01.820 --> 02:03:02.820]  let's go.
[02:03:02.820 --> 02:03:09.900]  Look, I don't like to get up here and say 1776 part two, states secede to get rid of
[02:03:09.900 --> 02:03:14.780]  the federal government and then re-upload it. A novel approach to what's constitutional,
[02:03:14.780 --> 02:03:20.540]  I've had constitutional scholars on to agree with my analysis. I told you months ago, people
[02:03:20.540 --> 02:03:22.300]  are like, why are you calling for his impeachment now?
[02:03:22.300 --> 02:03:26.380]  Why are you calling for 1776? Because they were saying what they were gonna do. And then
[02:03:26.380 --> 02:03:34.960]  right on time, the enabling crisis comes and it smells to high heaven. So when we come
[02:03:34.960 --> 02:03:42.220]  back, we're gonna be taking your phone calls here today. Specifically on what do you think
[02:03:42.220 --> 02:03:44.740]  you should be impeached for? Or do you disagree with me?
[02:03:44.740 --> 02:03:48.820]  And there's so many things that are impeachable. I'm thinking of new ones every few minutes.
[02:03:48.820 --> 02:03:55.580]  So you call in with what we should call it. I mean, the Bill of Particulars, the Bill
[02:03:55.580 --> 02:03:59.700]  of Impeachment for Barack Hussein Obama, that's what it's called, starts in the House. They
[02:03:59.700 --> 02:04:06.180]  vote to then have a trial in the Senate. I mean, it's time to go after Obama. He's their
[02:04:06.180 --> 02:04:09.460]  front man, he's their puppet, but he's the usurper.
[02:04:09.460 --> 02:04:14.620]  And look, I'm not some macho guy looking for trouble, but I'm not gonna be a slave. And
[02:04:14.620 --> 02:04:23.940]  I know what's going on. 800-259-9231 on this issue of treason, the executive orders. And
[02:04:23.940 --> 02:04:27.380]  they're playing this game of, yeah, I can do an executive order. I can't take everything
[02:04:27.380 --> 02:04:29.360]  with executive order, but I can take some stuff.
[02:04:29.360 --> 02:04:35.260]  You can't take anything. The Congress can't even pass a law to take our guns, folks, because
[02:04:35.260 --> 02:04:43.740]  it is unalienable. You cannot put a lien on it, inalienable. The Bill of Rights points
[02:04:43.740 --> 02:04:48.540]  out what's already there organically. I am not your slave. You are not getting my guns.
[02:04:48.540 --> 02:04:54.340]  And it's not the obsession over the guns, okay? My guns aren't even locked and loaded
[02:04:54.340 --> 02:04:58.780]  except for handguns and stuff for self-defense. It's the bellwether, the canary in the coal
[02:04:58.780 --> 02:05:00.780]  mine.
[02:05:00.780 --> 02:05:04.860]  Sick of the globalist eugenicist control freaks adding poison to your water and laughing as

[02:06:05.760 --> 02:06:11.460]  economic system runs from bad to worse. The globalist model is to shut down societies

[02:07:00.540 --> 02:07:05.640]  Looking back on 2012 we ask ourselves how did we ever survive from natural disasters
[02:07:05.640 --> 02:07:10.220]  like Hurricane Sandy and the devastating summer drought to the family hardships brought on
[02:07:10.220 --> 02:07:15.180]  by a disastrous economy. Our hearts go out to those that have lost everything. At eFoods

[02:08:21.900 --> 02:08:44.500]  From the front lines of the information war it's Alex Jones. Well all of you claimed you'd
[02:08:44.500 --> 02:08:50.860]  fight back if they came to confiscate the guns. Obama thinks you're weak and he thinks
[02:08:50.860 --> 02:08:58.260]  you're going to turn them in.
[02:08:58.260 --> 02:09:01.260]  Coming to you from the front lines of the info war and we're trying to keep it an info
[02:09:01.260 --> 02:09:07.880]  war. Bloomberg is in the news. Those articles are up at Infowars.com saying defy Congress.
[02:09:07.880 --> 02:09:14.900]  Just take the guns. The legislature has passed in the Senate a outright assault weapons confiscation.
[02:09:14.900 --> 02:09:22.500]  Here's the Biden headline. Joe Biden. White House eyeing 19 executive actions on guns.
[02:09:22.500 --> 02:09:26.780]  Executive orders. White House to announce the executive orders tomorrow. They are to
[02:09:26.780 --> 02:09:33.980]  include assault weapons ban. Ban of magazines that hold more than seven rounds. It's the
[02:09:33.980 --> 02:09:40.940]  Chicago gun ban. It's the Illinois gun ban. It's the universal background checks and limits
[02:09:40.940 --> 02:09:45.460]  on the number of bullets magazines can hold. And that's retroactive. They're saying you
[02:09:45.460 --> 02:09:48.620]  can't, you have to come in and register all your guns because you're not allowed now to
[02:09:48.620 --> 02:09:50.420]  sell it to your neighbor ever.
[02:09:50.420 --> 02:09:56.340]  According to sources familiar with the White House, or people working for the White House.
[02:09:56.340 --> 02:10:01.860]  Iowa lawmaker calls for retroactive gun ban, house to house gun confiscation of all semi-autos.
[02:10:01.860 --> 02:10:07.880]  CBS News, New York Assembly, Speaker, Silver. We are going to ban assault weapons, all semi-autos
[02:10:07.880 --> 02:10:21.260]  to be turned in. And the bill has passed the Senate. It's in the legislative session in
[02:10:21.260 --> 02:10:25.580]  the House. This is just unprecedented. And it says you come in and register them and
[02:10:25.580 --> 02:10:27.500]  we can take them on the spot if we want.
[02:10:27.500 --> 02:10:31.560]  That's what Cuomo called for two and a half weeks ago, remember? I mean, they got a plan.
[02:10:31.560 --> 02:10:38.120]  We know what it is. And then they'll get most the guns in this push, then there'll be more
[02:10:38.120 --> 02:10:41.620]  mass shootings. And they'll say that's it, just turn them in. And then they know there'll
[02:10:41.620 --> 02:10:46.220]  be resistance. Let me explain what's happening everybody here, okay?
[02:10:46.220 --> 02:10:57.700]  The toll free number to join us on air is 800-259-9231, 800-259-9231. And we will get
[02:10:57.700 --> 02:11:06.860]  you up and on the air today. A foreign criminal banking mafia took over the United States
[02:11:06.860 --> 02:11:10.780]  with the Federal Reserve with a beachhead in 1913. They used our energy, our power,
[02:11:10.780 --> 02:11:14.440]  our taxes to dominate most of the world and set up a world government.
[02:11:14.440 --> 02:11:18.340]  It's European banks, that's why we're merging with the EU basically. Those very same banks
[02:11:18.340 --> 02:11:23.020]  funded Lenin to get him into power, to get rid of that national sovereignty the Russians
[02:11:23.020 --> 02:11:28.940]  had. That's now been declassified. The same banks put Mao in to kill over 60 million people,
[02:11:28.940 --> 02:11:33.540]  some estimates are 80 plus mil, and to bring in that tyranny, that's a deal.
[02:11:33.540 --> 02:11:38.140]  They set up tyrannies all over the world. They put Muslim extremists in Libya and Syria.
[02:11:38.140 --> 02:11:42.980]  They're bad, their fruits are bad. They're really vicious. The people running our government
[02:11:42.980 --> 02:11:48.940]  have put real al-Qaeda in with al-Qaeda flags, al-Qaeda brigades, black uniforms with al-Qaeda
[02:11:48.940 --> 02:11:54.260]  patches. They are cutting Christians heads off on camera, the news thinks it's great.
[02:11:54.260 --> 02:11:58.420]  They are making father's suicide bomb or they kill their whole families. They are shooting
[02:11:58.420 --> 02:12:06.060]  at passenger airliners and blowing them up. And our media is like good, al-Qaeda is good.
[02:12:06.060 --> 02:12:10.580]  Back of the newspaper, al-Qaeda is doing a great job attacking Assad, who didn't do anything
[02:12:10.580 --> 02:12:12.580]  to anybody.
[02:12:12.580 --> 02:12:17.420]  That's how bold and how evil they are, okay? They think you're so dumb, the people running
[02:12:17.420 --> 02:12:25.300]  our country run al-Qaeda. And that's mainstream news. And even Glenn Beck admits that now,
[02:12:25.300 --> 02:12:28.700]  but calls me a traitor for saying our government runs al-Qaeda all these years. Why don't I
[02:12:28.700 --> 02:12:31.940]  get an apology?
[02:12:31.940 --> 02:12:38.020]  This isn't our government. And they have stolen 1.5 quadrillion in fake derivative money and
[02:12:38.020 --> 02:12:41.340]  they've signed us onto it. And it's hundreds of times what we could ever pay back. It's
[02:12:41.340 --> 02:12:46.020]  not our debt. Our real debt's about 16 trillion. And they use that to control us and tell us
[02:12:46.020 --> 02:12:49.460]  how we're debtors all day from the most wealthy nation in the world to the biggest debtor
[02:12:49.460 --> 02:12:51.580]  nation in the world in 50 years.
[02:12:51.580 --> 02:12:55.220]  From the highest test scores to the lowest, from the lowest cancer rate to the highest.
[02:12:55.220 --> 02:13:01.340]  We are a cursed, overtaken nation of debt slaves. They're now starting forced inoculations
[02:13:01.340 --> 02:13:06.780]  all over the country of school children outside of parental consent, abortions without parental
[02:13:06.780 --> 02:13:10.980]  consent. They just do what they want. And it's a felony every time they do it. No one
[02:13:10.980 --> 02:13:17.380]  will enforce. No attorney general will go after them. No county attorney, no city attorney,
[02:13:17.380 --> 02:13:21.220]  no one will stand up.
[02:13:21.220 --> 02:13:25.940]  Now we're starting to see state reps and federal, mainly people in Texas, Kentucky, Wyoming,
[02:13:25.940 --> 02:13:30.620]  places like that, places that the television demonizes, places the occupier collaborators
[02:13:30.620 --> 02:13:36.160]  demonize. They're starting to say, look, this is gonna go 1776. We're gonna nullify taking
[02:13:36.160 --> 02:13:38.180]  guns. Don't come in the state and do this.
[02:13:38.180 --> 02:13:42.420]  Don't, don't do this. Don't, don't, don't. Cuz everybody knows they, when they come for
[02:13:42.420 --> 02:13:47.820]  the guns, they're super bold, and they're gonna drop the hammer on 100 different fronts.
[02:13:47.820 --> 02:13:53.580]  The globalists are all going to go to prison unless they go for it all. The Chicago mafia,
[02:13:53.580 --> 02:14:01.020]  Emanuel, the DC mafia, the New York mafia, Bloomberg. They are the government mafia.
[02:14:01.020 --> 02:14:05.300]  They are the federal family. So that's what Janet calls them in letters. You are the federal
[02:14:05.300 --> 02:14:12.860]  family. The federal cancer, the federal family is taking over. The federal family is gonna
[02:14:12.860 --> 02:14:17.460]  double your power prices. The federal family is gonna triple your, they do the same thing
[02:14:17.460 --> 02:14:20.020]  in every other country, okay?
[02:14:20.020 --> 02:14:25.120]  They have an IMF World Bank 112 point plan. They're gonna implement it, all of it, right
[02:14:25.120 --> 02:14:29.940]  down the middle. And when you go bankrupt, they're gonna say, we got food stamps for
[02:14:29.940 --> 02:14:36.340]  you. We got full steps. We got social security. They want you broke. And then they're gonna
[02:14:36.340 --> 02:14:40.100]  have the conservatives say, make all these people hundreds of millions on welfare work.
[02:14:40.100 --> 02:14:43.980]  Now you're gonna be in government work brigades. Now you're gonna be government security brigades.
[02:14:43.980 --> 02:14:48.020]  This is the takeover. This is the collectivization. That's why they're going after farmers. That's
[02:14:48.020 --> 02:14:52.020]  why they're going after ranchers. That's why they're going after anybody that's self-sufficient.
[02:14:52.020 --> 02:14:56.020]  That's why they outlawed two years ago cash and secondhand sales in Louisiana. And they're
[02:14:56.020 --> 02:15:00.060]  actually putting people in jail for using cash. That's why they're surveilling us. That's
[02:15:00.060 --> 02:15:01.500]  why they're opening the borders.
[02:15:01.500 --> 02:15:04.380]  That's why they're getting ready to legalize all the illegal aliens, because they're gonna
[02:15:04.380 --> 02:15:09.740]  break this country. And they know you're not gonna turn your guns in and they're gonna
[02:15:09.740 --> 02:15:13.600]  pick you off one at a time. And they know some of you are gonna start fighting back
[02:15:13.600 --> 02:15:17.380]  and you're gonna be called terrorist on the news.
[02:15:17.380 --> 02:15:20.920]  And as they see patriots getting arrested, as they see police chiefs getting killed that
[02:15:20.920 --> 02:15:27.460]  don't play ball, as they see federal troops enter legislatures, they are gonna be on the
[02:15:27.460 --> 02:15:34.580]  news calling us terrorist and calling Obama Abraham Lincoln part two.
[02:15:34.580 --> 02:15:39.740]  Texas threatens to arrest any feds who try enforcing new gun rags. White House readies
[02:15:39.740 --> 02:15:45.060]  19 executive orders. Obama to surround himself with children to announce the new gun controls.
[02:15:45.060 --> 02:15:49.300]  See, it's for the children while he kills kids with the drones. Click on that top article.
[02:15:49.300 --> 02:15:57.180]  It's also up at mfallwars.com. W-O-A-I, TV and radio, Texas proposal, jail any federal
[02:15:57.180 --> 02:16:00.180]  officials trying to enforce new gun restrictions in the state.
[02:16:00.180 --> 02:16:04.940]  And what did the feds say last year when the House voted unanimously to not let the TSA
[02:16:04.940 --> 02:16:09.620]  grab our genitals and enforce party laws on the books? They said we'll have an armed F-16
[02:16:09.620 --> 02:16:14.900]  blockade and we will shoot down aircraft entering or flying out of your state. Bring it, come
[02:16:14.900 --> 02:16:19.300]  on, Obama. You already got Al Qaeda shooting down airlines in Europe or threatening to
[02:16:19.300 --> 02:16:21.660]  and shooting them down in Middle East.
[02:16:21.660 --> 02:16:26.420]  Go ahead, do it, you scum. You're an American usurper, you filth. We put that article back
[02:16:26.420 --> 02:16:32.420]  up there. I mean, it's on. A Texas lawmaker says, I want them on right now, guys, call
[02:16:32.420 --> 02:16:36.000]  them. A Texas lawmaker says, it's gonna be impossible in an hour. Everybody call that
[02:16:36.000 --> 02:16:37.420]  number right now, get them on.
[02:16:37.420 --> 02:16:41.460]  A Texas lawmaker says he plans to file the Firearms Protection Act, which would make
[02:16:41.460 --> 02:16:46.260]  any federal laws that may be passed, yeah, we reported on this yesterday, by Congress
[02:16:46.260 --> 02:16:50.620]  or imposed by presidential order, which would ban or restrict ownership of semi-automatic
[02:16:50.620 --> 02:16:54.940]  firearms or the limit the size of the gun magazines illegal in the state.
[02:16:54.940 --> 02:17:04.860]  WOAI 1200 reports, Republican Representative Steve Toth, good for him, says his measure
[02:17:04.860 --> 02:17:09.980]  also calls for felony charges to be filed against internal federal official, how about
[02:17:09.980 --> 02:17:15.100]  servant who tries to enforce the rule in the state. If a federal official comes to the
[02:17:15.100 --> 02:17:18.460]  state of Texas to enforce the federal executive order, they already have all the states and
[02:17:18.460 --> 02:17:21.100]  counties on arresting legal aliens, that's constitutional.
[02:17:21.100 --> 02:17:27.720]  Why can't we do this? See, if a federal official comes into the state of Texas to enforce the
[02:17:27.720 --> 02:17:35.620]  federal executive order, that person is subject to criminal prosecution. Toth told 1200 WOAI
[02:17:35.620 --> 02:17:42.380]  Joe Pags, listen to Joe Pags on the morning. I heard Joe Pags say it's okay to pay off
[02:17:42.380 --> 02:17:45.620]  the police when they want payoffs last week, I couldn't believe it.
[02:17:45.620 --> 02:17:50.060]  Let's go back to that, let's just go back to that article, thank you. Toth told 1200
[02:17:50.060 --> 02:17:57.180]  WOAI Joe Pags, he says his bill would make attempting to enforce a federal gun ban in
[02:17:57.180 --> 02:18:03.260]  Texas punishable by $50,000 five years in prison. Toth says he will file the measure
[02:18:03.260 --> 02:18:06.940]  after speaking with the state Republican Attorney General, Greg Abbott, who has already vowed
[02:18:06.940 --> 02:18:10.900]  to fight any federal measures which call for restrictions on weapons possession.
[02:18:10.900 --> 02:18:17.140]  Toth concedes that he would welcome a legal fight over his proposals. At some point, there
[02:18:17.140 --> 02:18:20.420]  needs to be a showdown between the state and the federal government over the supremacy
[02:18:20.420 --> 02:18:26.660]  clause, he said. Darn right, I want Toth on. You know what Toth means, and what is it,
[02:18:26.660 --> 02:18:27.660]  Hungarian?
[02:18:27.660 --> 02:18:39.300]  That's death to gun control right there. Dr. Death for the gun bill. Man, ladies and gentlemen,
[02:18:39.300 --> 02:18:47.980]  we need to deal with this. I got a new favorite person, this state rep. I want him on, I want
[02:18:47.980 --> 02:18:54.780]  him on, I want him on. We gotta get on the offensive now. It's gonna be horrible, Obama's
[02:18:54.780 --> 02:18:57.900]  gonna be surrounded by little kids when we have to protect him. How about from government
[02:18:57.900 --> 02:18:58.900]  tyranny?
[02:18:58.900 --> 02:19:03.460]  How about from all the kids you've been drone attacking? It's for the kids. I mean, how
[02:19:03.460 --> 02:19:10.220]  manipulative, how evil. We need to have counter demonstrations and counter press conferences
[02:19:10.220 --> 02:19:15.900]  with children. And say the federal government took guns out of schools and then the media
[02:19:15.900 --> 02:19:17.520]  advertise it as shooting zones.
[02:19:17.520 --> 02:19:22.820]  The blood's on your hands. The blood's on your hands, man, I'm so glad I got in the
[02:19:22.820 --> 02:19:28.620]  face of Piers Morgan. I'm so glad I raised the Paul Revere alarm. I'm so glad. That's
[02:19:28.620 --> 02:19:39.700]  what's gonna beat him is getting hardcore, not backing off to this. 800-25-99231, 800-25-99231.
[02:19:39.700 --> 02:19:44.620]  They're coming, they're coming, drums, drums, drums in the deep. Now they're here. Told
[02:19:44.620 --> 02:19:47.220]  you I heard the drums, now they're here.
[02:19:47.220 --> 02:19:51.900]  They are coming, they are coming. Your call straight ahead, straight ahead. Stay with
[02:19:51.900 --> 02:19:56.940]  us. Spread the word. Everybody tune in now. Key intel coming up and I'm calling for the
[02:19:56.940 --> 02:20:01.020]  impeachment. I'm writing the bill of impeachment.
[02:20:01.020 --> 02:20:04.860]  My name is Stephen Huir. After 22 years of nutritional counseling, I've observed that
[02:20:04.860 --> 02:20:09.580]  most brain malfunctions have at their roots some form of toxicity and brain damage. So
[02:20:09.580 --> 02:20:13.680]  whether it is poor memory, poor focus, lack of creative thinking, or more serious matters
[02:20:13.680 --> 02:20:18.060]  like inability to focus, speak normally, or remember things, the emphasis to getting one's
[02:20:18.060 --> 02:20:23.080]  brain working optimally needs to be on detoxification. One World Way supports your body's number
[02:20:23.080 --> 02:20:26.600]  one means of detoxification, which is glutathione production.
[02:20:26.600 --> 02:20:31.580]  My name is Angie and my son has suffered from borderline autism and constipation. I got
[02:20:31.580 --> 02:20:36.500]  him on One World Way and in two months his constipation is gone. He has become friendlier,
[02:20:36.500 --> 02:20:41.380]  he can carry on a normal conversation with me, and he has made his first friend. He's
[02:20:41.380 --> 02:20:45.900]  doing great and he looks forward to taking One World Way every day. You could offer him
[02:20:45.900 --> 02:20:49.820]  a present or a cake and he would prefer the One World Way.
[02:20:49.820 --> 02:21:00.780]  Go to OneWorldWay.com, that's OneWorldW-H-E-Y.com or call 888-988-3325, that's 888-988-3325.
[02:21:00.780 --> 02:21:06.300]  We travel so much and having a fake TV gives added peace of mind.
[02:21:06.300 --> 02:21:12.180]  Burglars look for houses that appear to be easy targets, but fake TV can fool even professional
[02:21:12.180 --> 02:21:15.780]  burglars into thinking someone is home watching television.
[02:21:15.780 --> 02:21:20.820]  As a recent widow living alone, it gives me great peace of mind to set my fake TV near
[02:21:20.820 --> 02:21:25.340]  a window and know that passing motorists and pedestrians will think someone is home watching
[02:21:25.340 --> 02:21:28.340]  TV when I'm actually away from home.
[02:21:28.340 --> 02:21:32.700]  Fake TV easily plugs into any outlet, just like a light on a timer.
[02:21:32.700 --> 02:21:37.260]  And they're so easy to use, you just plug them in and they're ready to go. Plus, they're
[02:21:37.260 --> 02:21:40.900]  so affordable that we have one upstairs and downstairs.
[02:21:40.900 --> 02:21:50.740]  Fake TV is only $34.95. Order your fake TV by calling 877-5FAKETV or go to Faketv.com.
[02:21:50.740 --> 02:21:57.140]  That's 877-532-5388 or Faketv.com.
[02:21:57.140 --> 02:21:59.780]  Fake TV, the burglar deterrent.
[02:21:59.780 --> 02:22:04.580]  Gold, it's like nothing else on earth. From the Romans through the Renaissance, from the
[02:22:04.580 --> 02:22:10.740]  industrial age to the space age, gold has weathered the test of time. For 6,000 years,
[02:22:10.740 --> 02:22:14.620]  gold has remained the ultimate store of wealth. According to the World Gold Council and the
[02:22:14.620 --> 02:22:19.440]  U.S. Mint, demand is at an all-time high. The stage is being set for the reemergence
[02:22:19.440 --> 02:22:24.620]  of gold as the common sense alternative to a fiat paper currency that gets weaker every
[02:22:24.620 --> 02:22:25.620]  day.

[02:24:10.420 --> 02:24:21.140]  Okay, I'm gonna go to your phone calls as promised and Paul Watson out here in the brakes
[02:24:21.140 --> 02:24:27.980]  are working on a bill of impeachment for Obama. So people can take our research and get it
[02:24:27.980 --> 02:24:35.140]  into official documents. And that is the point of this. Bill of impeachment of Obama for
[02:24:35.140 --> 02:24:40.820]  sedition and treason against the Republic of the United States of America. Boom, that's
[02:24:40.820 --> 02:24:41.820]  your headline.
[02:24:41.820 --> 02:24:46.200]  And then you take the Declaration of Independence and you basically rewrite it at the top. It's
[02:24:46.200 --> 02:24:50.620]  the same thing. Whereas we've seen a long train of abuses against the Bill of Rights,
[02:24:50.620 --> 02:24:56.320]  the Constitution, a president who's used his office to turn us over to NATO and UN control
[02:24:56.320 --> 02:25:03.300]  that has publicly told Congress that the UN gives him orders and not the Congress who
[02:25:03.300 --> 02:25:12.940]  has openly been fomenting and working with media, including foreign media, to overthrow
[02:25:12.940 --> 02:25:16.560]  our Second Amendment.
[02:25:16.560 --> 02:25:22.280]  And then you just break down the fact that it is an absolute imperative for Congress
[02:25:22.280 --> 02:25:30.700]  not to have all of their just powers completely usurped. That Obama has signed secret directives
[02:25:30.700 --> 02:25:36.220]  on cybersecurity and blocked Congress from seeing it when it is their right and their
[02:25:36.220 --> 02:25:42.380]  duty. I mean, I've listed a whole laundry list of this, but it's two or three paragraphs
[02:25:42.380 --> 02:25:44.660]  written like the Declaration of Independence.
[02:25:44.660 --> 02:25:50.700]  You can read Clinton's bill of impeachment. It just states what he's done. That Obama
[02:25:50.700 --> 02:25:56.380]  lied to Congress and lied to the people saying he didn't want the NDAA passed when he had
[02:25:56.380 --> 02:26:02.860]  written it. And then said he wouldn't sign it and then did, lying. That's the president
[02:26:02.860 --> 02:26:07.420]  lying to Congress. He wrote letters to Congress saying don't pass this when behind the scenes
[02:26:07.420 --> 02:26:09.280]  he'd written letters saying pass it.
[02:26:09.280 --> 02:26:17.660]  That's lying, that's perjury. Violating his oath of office on so many fronts, shutting
[02:26:17.660 --> 02:26:22.700]  down power plants, implementing Kyoto protocols, even though Congress three years ago did not
[02:26:22.700 --> 02:26:29.540]  pass the Kyoto greenhouse gas legislation. I mean, it's incredible. Giving selective
[02:26:29.540 --> 02:26:35.280]  waivers to thousands of companies that are donors for that under Obamacare.
[02:26:35.280 --> 02:26:42.580]  I mean, the list goes on and on here. I know Watson's listening right now. He's codifying
[02:26:42.580 --> 02:26:45.700]  it all and I'll work with him more when the show's over. But we're gonna get this out
[02:26:45.700 --> 02:26:54.860]  on infowars.com and prisonplanet.com. And it is absolutely essential that you get this
[02:26:54.860 --> 02:26:59.080]  bill of impeachment because that's how impeachment works.
[02:26:59.080 --> 02:27:04.620]  It goes through the House for a vote and you have a trial in the Senate. And if there was
[02:27:04.620 --> 02:27:09.140]  any justice in this world, Obama would be impeached. We're gonna list Fast and Furious
[02:27:09.140 --> 02:27:14.480]  and the lying to Congress about that. Look, look, look, he's getting away with everything.
[02:27:14.480 --> 02:27:21.340]  And they're going to go for broke. And then finally, we need to state in the declaration
[02:27:21.340 --> 02:27:29.200]  that we know that the criminals are moving, the usurpers, the occupiers for these corporate
[02:27:29.200 --> 02:27:32.540]  foreign banks are doing this because they think they can win.
[02:27:32.540 --> 02:27:36.880]  They think they've got enough dirt, enough blackmail, and enough everything that they
[02:27:36.880 --> 02:27:43.720]  can get this through. And even if they can't, it gets us used to the idea of a dictator.
[02:27:43.720 --> 02:27:50.240]  And whereas members of the Senate have pointed out that he's becoming a king, that's right.
[02:27:50.240 --> 02:27:57.520]  And we kicked a king out of here in 1776, we've got to do it again.
[02:27:57.520 --> 02:28:01.780]  And whereas Obama is trying to block arming the schools so they can protect themselves
[02:28:01.780 --> 02:28:08.320]  and trying to bar the public from their ancient common right, common law right to self-defense,
[02:28:08.320 --> 02:28:12.960]  he must be removed. And again, people say, well, Obama's a puppet.
[02:28:12.960 --> 02:28:17.440]  Yes, they've all been puppets for a long time. But this guy is the head puppet and he's the
[02:28:17.440 --> 02:28:24.520]  titular head of this treason. He's moving at warp speed. And Mitt Romney supported banning
[02:28:24.520 --> 02:28:25.520]  guns as well.
[02:28:25.520 --> 02:28:31.720]  I warned you folks that the fix was in either way you slice it. And if you think you're
[02:28:31.720 --> 02:28:35.820]  just gonna turn your guns in and this is all gonna stop, you're gravely mistaken. There
[02:28:35.820 --> 02:28:42.160]  will be people that resist this. And if there isn't, they will manufacture it to call them
[02:28:42.160 --> 02:28:51.240]  terrorists to start the great purge. Homeland Security is a Soviet-style NKVD, okay?
[02:28:51.240 --> 02:28:56.520]  That's what it is. That's why they popularized torture. By the way, he used to be impeached
[02:28:56.520 --> 02:29:00.120]  for Benghazi, lying about that, saying he didn't know. Turned out they did know, add
[02:29:00.120 --> 02:29:07.880]  that to the bill of impeachment. Missiles being sent to Al Qaeda with the Turkish ambassador,
[02:29:07.880 --> 02:29:09.800]  add it to the impeachment, all of it.
[02:29:09.800 --> 02:29:13.560]  There are crimes out in the open. Don't you wrap a bunch of kids up there around you on
[02:29:13.560 --> 02:29:17.560]  the stage and say, I'm coming for your guns. Here's my executive order to see if you can
[02:29:17.560 --> 02:29:22.040]  get away with this. Don't you do it. They want world government. These foreign banks
[02:29:22.040 --> 02:29:25.280]  want unified, 80% worldwide taxes.
[02:29:25.280 --> 02:29:30.840]  They can't stand the mafia in Chicago and New York that people are running down to places
[02:29:30.840 --> 02:29:36.040]  like Texas and other areas that have lower taxes and more freedom. They want a worldwide
[02:29:36.040 --> 02:29:39.920]  mafia where they're armed, you're not, and they can do whatever they want to you. Well,

[02:30:41.240 --> 02:30:46.320]  chemistry of aloe vera to quickly penetrate and nourish the skin while delivering the

[02:33:16.840 --> 02:33:29.880]  Traveling patriots worldwide. You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:33:29.880 --> 02:33:35.040]  Ladies and gentlemen, I'm proud of Texas. We're not perfect, but you notice we're national
[02:33:35.040 --> 02:33:42.080]  news everywhere. Texas has the bill to arrest feds down here trying to take our guns. Texas
[02:33:42.080 --> 02:33:47.200]  tried to get the bill passed, got killed by Perry at the top, unanimously in the house,
[02:33:47.200 --> 02:33:50.800]  passed it to arrest the TSA.
[02:33:50.800 --> 02:33:55.800]  Texas just introduced the legislation and our state representatives calling for the
[02:33:55.800 --> 02:34:03.640]  impeachment of Barack Obama for high crimes and misdemeanors. It's happening. And I come
[02:34:03.640 --> 02:34:11.500]  to you from the capital of Texas, Austin. I come to you from the heart of the resistance.
[02:34:11.500 --> 02:34:16.840]  We are here. We are standing to the end. This is only the beginning, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:34:16.840 --> 02:34:22.820]  This is only the beginning. And again, if we give the guns up, it's over. If you give
[02:34:22.820 --> 02:34:27.840]  the guns up, they're gonna take everything. They will steal everything. They will shut
[02:34:27.840 --> 02:34:28.840]  the economy down.
[02:34:28.840 --> 02:34:38.200]  That is the Agenda 21 plan. These are hardcore criminals in government. I know a lot of congressmen
[02:34:38.200 --> 02:34:42.200]  and women listen to this show in Tennessee and Virginia, you name it. I know I've talked
[02:34:42.200 --> 02:34:46.040]  to them off air. I've had them on as guests, a lot of them. And they know, they privately
[02:34:46.040 --> 02:34:47.040]  completely agree with me.
[02:34:47.040 --> 02:34:51.440]  Well, it's now time to go public. Time to get up there on the floor of the house and
[02:34:51.440 --> 02:34:57.880]  go, you are a crook, Obama. Okay, we either get in their face hardcore right now, or they're
[02:34:57.880 --> 02:35:03.200]  gonna bring in tyranny, martial law. They're gonna hunt us down. They are gonna one by
[02:35:03.200 --> 02:35:05.200]  one come after us.
[02:35:05.200 --> 02:35:08.940]  And then if we resist to defend ourselves, we're gonna be called terrorist. We have got
[02:35:08.940 --> 02:35:13.640]  to hit them while we still have the Internet and we still have talk radio with everything
[02:35:13.640 --> 02:35:20.400]  we've got and stop playing Mr. Nicey Pants. Paul Revere rode through saying, to arms,
[02:35:20.400 --> 02:35:22.120]  to arms, the redcoats are coming.
[02:35:22.120 --> 02:35:27.120]  All I did was go on stand and say, you're on notice. You know this is gonna start 1776
[02:35:27.120 --> 02:35:34.520]  part two if you try this. You redcoat? He's a redcoat. A guy fleeing justice in England.
[02:35:34.520 --> 02:35:46.480]  I mean, give me a pirate. I'm here where my family's been for 300 plus years in the United
[02:35:46.480 --> 02:35:47.480]  States.
[02:35:47.480 --> 02:35:53.840]  I'm here in Texas where we've been since 1830 or even before. I'm here. I'm here. I'm in
[02:35:53.840 --> 02:35:58.800]  a corner. I've got a right to self defense. I'm not your slave. I declare that natural
[02:35:58.800 --> 02:36:04.560]  right before God in the universe. And it's time you declare it as well. By the way, the
[02:36:04.560 --> 02:36:07.000]  Bundesbank's pulling their gold out of the US.
[02:36:07.000 --> 02:36:12.960]  How many countries? It's more than 20 countries in the last year, since early 2012, that have
[02:36:12.960 --> 02:36:19.520]  pulled their gold out of the US. That article's up at infullwars.com. German Bundesbank to
[02:36:19.520 --> 02:36:25.140]  repatriate gold from New York Fed. Trust in central banks by other central banks is ending.
[02:36:25.140 --> 02:36:31.920]  That's a mainstream media headline by the New York Fed. The trust is over. That's why
[02:36:31.920 --> 02:36:36.000]  they want the guns. These people are crooks. They should all be in jail like Bernie Madoff.
[02:36:36.000 --> 02:36:41.720]  You put Ken Lay and Bernie Madoff in jail. You put all these banksters, these Federal
[02:36:41.720 --> 02:36:46.120]  Reserve top board members, a lot of their own board members have been saying it's tyranny.
[02:36:46.120 --> 02:36:48.820]  Even board members have been saying what's happening is wrong, cuz they realize they're
[02:36:48.820 --> 02:36:51.920]  gonna bring the whole thing down.
[02:36:51.920 --> 02:36:54.920]  You know they've had the Dallas Fed head, the Kansas City Fed head, and others come
[02:36:54.920 --> 02:37:01.360]  out and say what the Fed's doing is criminal? Their own people are saying it's criminal
[02:37:01.360 --> 02:37:11.360]  publicly, because it's criminal. And listen, I'm not asking, I'm commanding police and
[02:37:11.360 --> 02:37:14.880]  military as a sovereign citizen.
[02:37:14.880 --> 02:37:19.400]  Just like you have citizens arrest, I'm giving you a citizens order to another citizen. You
[02:37:19.400 --> 02:37:25.080]  know why I give you that order? You swore before God and man to protect and defend the
[02:37:25.080 --> 02:37:31.260]  Constitution from all enemies foreign and domestic. And our Constitution is in shreds
[02:37:31.260 --> 02:37:32.260]  right now.
[02:37:32.260 --> 02:37:37.520]  They're trying to burn what's left of it. And if you won't hit the streets right now
[02:37:37.520 --> 02:37:42.300]  aggressively, I don't care what you've got to do. I'm thinking about putting bullhorns
[02:37:42.300 --> 02:37:46.640]  on the top of my car and driving around at 2 AM in neighborhoods bullhorning. And when
[02:37:46.640 --> 02:37:49.760]  the cops pull up with their lights on and jump out and freak out, I'm gonna go, what
[02:37:49.760 --> 02:37:51.920]  am I supposed to do?
[02:37:51.920 --> 02:37:55.780]  I'm just Paul Revere driving through the night saying you're in danger. Our government's
[02:37:55.780 --> 02:38:01.000]  been taken over by foreign powers. And see, that's a psy-op of truth. People only pay
[02:38:01.000 --> 02:38:05.920]  attention cuz they've never been warned in their sleep. I'm serious, I may put bullhorns
[02:38:05.920 --> 02:38:10.460]  on my truck tonight and drive around announcing to people that the redcoats are coming.
[02:38:10.460 --> 02:38:15.680]  Not saying the arms to arms, to info arms, because people will wake up. See, they're
[02:38:15.680 --> 02:38:20.000]  in a comfort zone. They've got a normalcy bias. They've got a Stockholm syndrome, a
[02:38:20.000 --> 02:38:26.320]  learned helplessness to put up with anything. I wouldn't ask you to do that. I am intending
[02:38:26.320 --> 02:38:28.760]  soon to start doing midnight rides.
[02:38:28.760 --> 02:38:36.480]  I'm gonna start driving through neighborhoods. And if the cops arrest me, so be it. Because
[02:38:36.480 --> 02:38:39.240]  I'm gonna start telling people, get up, get up when they come out. I'm gonna get out with
[02:38:39.240 --> 02:38:42.480]  a bullhorn at night and say, Paul Revere, road to warn you what was happening.
[02:38:42.480 --> 02:38:46.160]  Our country's been taken over by foreign banks. They're like, what are you doing, crazy man?
[02:38:46.160 --> 02:38:50.280]  I'm crazy. You think you're gonna be free watching ESPN all day? You think you're gonna
[02:38:50.280 --> 02:38:54.400]  be free not knowing about politics and not being involved? No, you're gonna be overrun
[02:38:54.400 --> 02:38:59.640]  and made a slave if you don't defend your freedom, Thomas Jefferson.
[02:38:59.640 --> 02:39:04.260]  That's how domesticated and sick the public is, that they see it weird when you hang a
[02:39:04.260 --> 02:39:09.040]  banner hang on the highway about tyranny. Or when you call into radio and get upset.
[02:39:09.040 --> 02:39:13.680]  I was on The Young Turks on Al Gore's foreign-owned TV thing last night. And they're going, you
[02:39:13.680 --> 02:39:21.720]  need mental help. You need to go, yeah, I need mental help, don't I? I need mental help
[02:39:21.720 --> 02:39:24.960]  because I know they're putting cancer viruses in the vaccines.
[02:39:24.960 --> 02:39:30.240]  The top friend of the royal family, it's now being confirmed doing satanic rituals with
[02:39:30.240 --> 02:39:35.680]  little kids. And it's not even a news item that why was this guy given total access to
[02:39:35.680 --> 02:39:41.080]  the royal family? And it just confirms everything I already know. These are a bunch of child
[02:39:41.080 --> 02:39:44.600]  molesting devil worshipers that run the New World Order.
[02:39:44.600 --> 02:39:49.320]  They're evil. And people are like, that sounds crazy, really, that you don't know history.
[02:39:49.320 --> 02:39:57.680]  Have you studied any historical groups? Scum always gets in control. That's why our forebearers
[02:39:57.680 --> 02:40:03.760]  were this multi-thousand year leap forward, pointing out the evil and corruption of humankind,
[02:40:03.760 --> 02:40:07.600]  especially at the top, and systems to tie that down and control it.
[02:40:07.600 --> 02:40:14.520]  And now those final bulwarks are under absolute Alamo-level assault right now. I mean, this
[02:40:14.520 --> 02:40:20.880]  is it, okay? This is a full-on assault. I know that we've got eugenicist criminals running
[02:40:20.880 --> 02:40:24.440]  things. I've read countless books, they wrote how they're poisoning our food and water.
[02:40:24.440 --> 02:40:30.160]  They think you're so dumb, they write confessions how they're killing us. And they know using
[02:40:30.160 --> 02:40:35.640]  psychology how to hide it in plain view. Every cop, every military person, I command you
[02:40:35.640 --> 02:40:40.480]  to follow your oath and to speak out and to resist this tyranny.
[02:40:40.480 --> 02:40:47.120]  I command you, who have taken oaths to protect and defend, to speak out about what's happening.
[02:40:47.120 --> 02:40:52.040]  I command the union heads, the politicians, all of the people that aren't pure evil, you
[02:40:52.040 --> 02:40:56.480]  better decide what side you're on right now. And I command you, in the name of the Bill
[02:40:56.480 --> 02:41:00.080]  of Rights, the Constitution, and the Declaration of Independence, not just the military and
[02:41:00.080 --> 02:41:01.080]  the police.
[02:41:01.080 --> 02:41:07.960]  But the public who has sat there on your hind ends, I command you, if you claim you're good
[02:41:07.960 --> 02:41:13.920]  and you serve justice, I command you, in the name of the Republic, to activate now and
[02:41:13.920 --> 02:41:21.040]  to stand up and to get in a posture of total resistance. But you think I came out and called
[02:41:21.040 --> 02:41:24.640]  for a second American Revolution a few months ago cuz I was playing games?
[02:41:24.640 --> 02:41:31.760]  I know what's happening. I know what's going on. I know what's happening. Listen, if we
[02:41:31.760 --> 02:41:36.560]  just had regular old corrupt groups in who were really misguided and all this stuff,
[02:41:36.560 --> 02:41:40.400]  I would not be this freaked out. Because I would say politically, we can fix it down
[02:41:40.400 --> 02:41:41.400]  the road.
[02:41:41.400 --> 02:41:45.100]  You're not gonna fix any of this. The pendulum isn't gonna swing back. The pendulum already
[02:41:45.100 --> 02:41:48.940]  swung back. They know you hate them. They know you don't trust them. They didn't really
[02:41:48.940 --> 02:41:56.840]  elect Obama. It's all a fraud, and they're coming for everybody. They want a hot takeover.
[02:41:56.840 --> 02:42:00.080]  And if you don't know what a hot takeover is, look at what the Soviets did in the Ukraine
[02:42:00.080 --> 02:42:01.080]  and Czechoslovakia.
[02:42:01.080 --> 02:42:07.080]  Look at what Hitler did in Poland. If you don't know what a hot takeover is, it means
[02:42:07.080 --> 02:42:13.340]  absolute war, guaranteed, and the globalists want the police to be killed. That's part
[02:42:13.340 --> 02:42:19.960]  of the plan. Then they'll bring their scum in as the second wave. Let me tell you, I
[02:42:19.960 --> 02:42:21.040]  can see it in their eyes.
[02:42:21.040 --> 02:42:24.840]  The globalists are excited now. They're engaged. They're confident. And you know why they're
[02:42:24.840 --> 02:42:28.840]  confident? They've been on the defensive. They're confident now because they're going
[02:42:28.840 --> 02:42:33.980]  operational. They've already jumped out of the back of the plane, folks. They're already
[02:42:33.980 --> 02:42:37.680]  coming in. They already pulled the trigger.
[02:42:37.680 --> 02:42:46.320]  It's on. It's on. It is on. It is on. It is on. False flags, all of it. It is on. It
[02:42:46.320 --> 02:42:54.540]  is on. It is on. You understand? These people put in the newspapers, they run Al-Qaeda.
[02:42:54.540 --> 02:42:57.920]  And they saw the public suck their thumb. They went, okay, we're gonna take your guns
[02:42:57.920 --> 02:42:58.920]  now.
[02:42:58.920 --> 02:43:01.800]  We're gonna give your kids shots without telling you. We're gonna take your 12-year-old, give
[02:43:01.800 --> 02:43:07.040]  them an abortion without telling you. We will raise your taxes. They're already saying they're
[02:43:07.040 --> 02:43:13.700]  gonna raise the taxes again. They're already raising the payroll taxes on the entire population
[02:43:13.700 --> 02:43:23.180]  that works. Man, they're sick. Let's go to the calls. Michelle, that's Michael in Canada.
[02:43:23.180 --> 02:43:24.180]  You're on the air. Go ahead.
[02:43:24.180 --> 02:43:30.200]  Hey, listen, Alex. First of all, I wanna say a couple of things about your appearances
[02:43:30.200 --> 02:43:36.720]  on mainstream media lately. And number one is I cannot believe what a slimeball coward
[02:43:36.720 --> 02:43:42.920]  that Piers Morgan is. To drag out the victim's families, to hide behind and throw rocks at
[02:43:42.920 --> 02:43:50.280]  you from, what an act of absolute cowardice, betraying their very nature. Next thing I
[02:43:50.280 --> 02:43:59.400]  wanna say about it is you have no idea still yet just what effect you are having with your
[02:43:59.400 --> 02:44:04.880]  anger on the mainstream media. It is awakening and anger that's been there the whole time.
[02:44:04.880 --> 02:44:09.920]  You are rousing people, giving them the permission themselves to get angry. And it's gonna unleash
[02:44:09.920 --> 02:44:13.760]  their reaction and the response needed at this time.
[02:44:13.760 --> 02:44:19.080]  Well, I just said, God, whatever you want me to do on the air, do it. And I just got
[02:44:19.080 --> 02:44:23.280]  mad at that guy and that's what I did. And it's up to you guys what happens out of all
[02:44:23.280 --> 02:44:27.000]  this. I mean, I am right up on the tip of the spear. I need everybody's prayers, but
[02:44:27.000 --> 02:44:29.320]  whatever happens, I'm not in fear.
[02:44:29.320 --> 02:44:33.480]  I'm only in fear that I won't work hard enough, I won't do a good enough job. We've gotta
[02:44:33.480 --> 02:44:39.660]  get America out of the trance. America is in a ninnying trance. The average American
[02:44:39.660 --> 02:44:44.480]  would come out and shoot Paul Revere today. Okay, we've got to get out of this trance,
[02:44:44.480 --> 02:44:47.620]  this learned helplessness. God bless you, Michael.
[02:44:47.620 --> 02:44:53.160]  Let's go ahead and talk to who's up next here. Let's go ahead and talk to Mark in Kansas.
[02:44:53.160 --> 02:44:56.680]  Mark in Kansas, you're on the air, go ahead.
[02:44:56.680 --> 02:45:03.720]  Yes, Alex. Thanks for taking the call. I just want to first off say that my family prays
[02:45:03.720 --> 02:45:12.960]  for your family every day and we appreciate everything you do. The local Prestitude Media
[02:45:12.960 --> 02:45:22.560]  broke a story today that Walmart is offering to employ any veteran that wants a job here
[02:45:22.560 --> 02:45:30.240]  on the local media. And I just want to call attention to that. I hope that our veterans
[02:45:30.240 --> 02:45:38.000]  don't fall for this McDonald's trinket in the Happy Meal bobble that they're gonna hang
[02:45:38.000 --> 02:45:41.400]  out there in front of them and fall for that crap.
[02:45:41.400 --> 02:45:46.800]  Walmart shouldn't have sold the slave goods all these years and been used to deindustrialize
[02:45:46.800 --> 02:45:51.240]  our country. And Walmart shouldn't have promoted NAFTA and GATT. But no, yeah, exactly. They've
[02:45:51.240 --> 02:45:55.900]  domesticated you now and we're down here in the pits kind of like telling us rub the lotion
[02:45:55.900 --> 02:45:58.900]  on our skin.
[02:45:58.900 --> 02:46:02.400]  They just want a good skin when they skin us.
[02:46:02.400 --> 02:46:08.800]  Better way to surveil and keep a thumb on our veterans than to try and bring them into
[02:46:08.800 --> 02:46:15.880]  the fold for 29 hours a week so that they don't have to pay the Obamacare tax on them
[02:46:15.880 --> 02:46:23.000]  again. That being said, I hope our military and our veterans understand what that's all
[02:46:23.000 --> 02:46:24.240]  about.
[02:46:24.240 --> 02:46:31.840]  The other thing is I just implore that your listeners do anything that they can with their
[02:46:31.840 --> 02:46:37.000]  state legislatures to try and get them to abolish.
[02:46:37.000 --> 02:46:41.160]  Everyone should be driving to their state house now, whether it's in session or not,
[02:46:41.160 --> 02:46:45.120]  and running up and down the halls getting in everybody's faces. Everybody should be
[02:46:45.120 --> 02:46:50.760]  doing banner hangs. Everyone should be spending hours a day fighting, okay?
[02:46:50.760 --> 02:46:55.560]  I mean, and again, just get aggressive, get the buzz going, wake up America, and just
[02:46:55.560 --> 02:47:00.200]  keep pointing out criminals run Washington. They're not misguided liberals. These are
[02:47:00.200 --> 02:47:03.560]  horrible authoritarian mafia thugs.
[02:47:03.560 --> 02:47:12.600]  Yeah, the listeners need to understand we are financing our own enslavement. And just
[02:47:12.600 --> 02:47:19.400]  one thought in getting off the air, when we can no longer feed the beast, the beast is
[02:47:19.400 --> 02:47:22.280]  gonna feed on us, and we're almost there.
[02:47:22.280 --> 02:47:27.680]  Well, that's how it always works. You're absolutely right. You're absolutely right. And that's
[02:47:27.680 --> 02:47:32.840]  where it always goes to forced labor camps because the parasites always destroy everything.
[02:47:32.840 --> 02:47:36.440]  And then finally just say, okay, you're gonna work in a forced labor camp for me.
[02:47:36.440 --> 02:47:40.000]  And then there's never even goods there, so they always invade the next country to loot
[02:47:40.000 --> 02:47:45.720]  them. I mean, this is what we have been overrun by absolute criminals. God bless you. Yeah,
[02:47:45.720 --> 02:47:49.640]  I was looking at impeachment reasons in the Constitution. We're gonna add to the article
[02:47:49.640 --> 02:47:54.600]  that Paul Watson and I are putting together, impeachment for high crimes and misdemeanors.
[02:47:54.600 --> 02:48:00.000]  Perjury of oath. Swear to uphold the Constitution, authorize for war. I mean, boom, right there.
[02:48:00.000 --> 02:48:06.200]  Said that the UN and NATO runs it, not Congress. Second Amendment, NATO. Birth certificate
[02:48:06.200 --> 02:48:12.960]  issues, NDAA. Abuse of authority, Second Amendment, Libya, Fast and Furious, TSA, Fourth Amendment,
[02:48:12.960 --> 02:48:13.960]  NDAA hoax.
[02:48:13.960 --> 02:48:18.840]  EPA versus Cole, lying to Congress, abuse of executive orders to circumvent Congress
[02:48:18.840 --> 02:48:26.040]  and bragging about it to the press. Missiles to Al-Qaeda, Libya, Syria. Bribery. I mean,
[02:48:26.040 --> 02:48:30.320]  what do you call it when he gives waivers to companies that give him campaign donations?
[02:48:30.320 --> 02:48:37.360]  Intimidations, Valerie Jarrett, misuse of assets, the vacations, the selective waivers
[02:48:37.360 --> 02:48:42.560]  for EPA versus Cole, failures to supervise Fast and Furious. So you don't even have to
[02:48:42.560 --> 02:48:47.600]  be consciously doing it, just dereliction of duty. Get out of here, you scum. Okay,
[02:48:47.600 --> 02:48:49.520]  you got caught lying to Congress about Fast and Furious.
[02:48:49.520 --> 02:48:53.480]  How about you killed all those people in Mexico and the US, you're impeached for that, along
[02:48:53.480 --> 02:48:59.580]  with your stinking Attorney General. Fast and Furious, lying about Benghazi, missiles
[02:48:59.580 --> 02:49:06.560]  to Al-Qaeda, lying about radiation dangers in the wake of Fukushima. And the 48 leaking
[02:49:06.560 --> 02:49:12.640]  nuclear power plants, dereliction of duty goes on. Conduct unbecoming, and we go through
[02:49:12.640 --> 02:49:17.240]  a big list of those, refusal to obey a lawful order, authorization for war.
[02:49:17.240 --> 02:49:20.840]  Congress sent him a letter, said you can't do this, he still did it. Said I don't need
[02:49:20.840 --> 02:49:27.400]  you, he was belligerent to Congress. Man, man, they're planning something big, they're coming
[02:49:27.400 --> 02:49:32.200]  after the guns. I can just see when they blow up some buildings and then pose as saviors,
[02:49:32.200 --> 02:49:37.360]  it's gonna be so sick. And the public's so soft too. Mark in Oregon, you're on the air,
[02:49:37.360 --> 02:49:38.360]  go ahead.
[02:49:38.360 --> 02:49:39.360]  Hello, brother Alex.
[02:49:39.360 --> 02:49:41.360]  Good, go ahead sir, welcome.
[02:49:41.360 --> 02:49:48.200]  Alex, I've got what I think are two of the most important points that could be made at
[02:49:48.200 --> 02:49:54.600]  this point in time. And number one is simply that Joyce Riley is having an expose of all
[02:49:54.600 --> 02:50:00.160]  of the gross inconsistencies of the Sandy Hook shooting, including the big red circle
[02:50:00.160 --> 02:50:03.280]  around Sandy Hook on the map in the Batman movie.
[02:50:03.280 --> 02:50:09.600]  Today or tomorrow, I thought maybe you'd have her on and she could go over things with him.
[02:50:09.600 --> 02:50:14.480]  Yeah, that's an interesting idea. We've done some expose of that, we pretty much broke
[02:50:14.480 --> 02:50:20.400]  the Batman information. Before it happened, we said Batman's a trigger movie. And the
[02:50:20.400 --> 02:50:25.160]  media is like, why are they pointing at Batman now? Like we just randomly went and looked
[02:50:25.160 --> 02:50:27.280]  in Batman and found Sandy Hook.
[02:50:27.280 --> 02:50:33.300]  Bain mailed out, the movie producers had Bain mail out to hundreds of different media groups
[02:50:33.300 --> 02:50:38.920]  a map of targets and one of them Sandy Hook. And then the other movie, before it had a
[02:50:38.920 --> 02:50:43.000]  bunch of triggers in it, so I hear you, I hear you. Look, I just haven't gone there
[02:50:43.000 --> 02:50:48.880]  because the general public doesn't understand why they do this stuff, it's too esoteric.
[02:50:48.880 --> 02:50:53.040]  Obviously there were other shooters, obviously the Batman shooting. Again, that happened
[02:50:53.040 --> 02:50:59.280]  with the Batman film. You get it, it's Batman, Batman in Colorado. He was under government
[02:50:59.280 --> 02:51:00.280]  funding.
[02:51:00.280 --> 02:51:06.480]  Feeling like there are too many pressures and demands on you? Losing sleep, worrying
[02:51:06.480 --> 02:51:11.380]  about tests and school work, either on the run because your schedule is just too busy?

[02:52:16.480 --> 02:52:21.120]  incompetent line crooks that are counting on your ignorance and fear to keep your power
[02:52:21.120 --> 02:52:26.640]  bills criminally high. Some have called this a conspiracy, others have called it a cover-up

[02:54:18.080 --> 02:54:25.720]  I give you our leader Rahm Emanuel, our king. He says we don't need the people to be involved
[02:54:25.720 --> 02:54:30.760]  in the debate. You're just scum. The police are God and they'll decide to take the guns.
[02:54:30.760 --> 02:54:35.760]  Here is the Chicago Don Rahm Emanuel, Israeli officer. Here he is.
[02:54:35.760 --> 02:54:40.800]  One, it's all about criminal access. It's not about gun control. It's about criminal
[02:54:40.800 --> 02:54:47.440]  access to guns. That changes the debate. Two, put the police chief in the law enforcement
[02:54:47.440 --> 02:54:53.560]  community front and center. Everybody else, from politician to whatever, take a back seat,
[02:54:53.560 --> 02:54:57.080]  because the police chiefs have a credibility and authority and a voice on this, which is
[02:54:57.080 --> 02:55:02.260]  why they're all there. I do believe, as it relates to both the type of weapon being an
[02:55:02.260 --> 02:55:07.440]  assault weapon in this case, or the assault magazine, as Mike has, I think, strenuously
[02:55:07.440 --> 02:55:14.580]  focused us on message on that, because the difference between a magazine that holds ten
[02:55:14.580 --> 02:55:19.640]  and a magazine that holds 20 or 30 is a lot of different type of damage that's done.
[02:55:19.640 --> 02:55:21.520]  And those are the three things I do think-
[02:55:21.520 --> 02:55:28.400]  All right, folks, so there you go. The government has credibility. The police do. Even elected
[02:55:28.400 --> 02:55:32.480]  representatives, you take a back seat, pandering to the police. These police chiefs are all
[02:55:32.480 --> 02:55:39.440]  basically federal minions, almost all the big ones are. Just amazing that we've gotten
[02:55:39.440 --> 02:55:44.580]  to this point in this country. And it's gonna get bad, but the offshore banks, they want
[02:55:44.580 --> 02:55:45.580]  a civil war.
[02:55:45.580 --> 02:55:50.280]  That's part of the plan. It's not that they don't care if you die. They want you to die
[02:55:50.280 --> 02:55:55.760]  in a war with the American people. It's essential to call Congress, to call your state reps,
[02:55:55.760 --> 02:56:01.500]  but to travel there physically. It is essential to print off news articles from mfallwars.com
[02:56:01.500 --> 02:56:05.520]  and to physically bring them to the local radio station, the local TV station.
[02:56:05.520 --> 02:56:12.640]  It is essential when these articles of impeachment, this bill of impeachment, but it will be articles
[02:56:12.640 --> 02:56:17.900]  of impeachment. That's what we'll call it. That's the proper term. Go everywhere. It'll
[02:56:17.900 --> 02:56:29.180]  be up the next hour or so at mfallwars.com and prisonplanet.com. It's essential. Let's
[02:56:29.180 --> 02:56:31.640]  go ahead and go to John in Texas.
[02:56:31.640 --> 02:56:38.600]  John, you're on the air. I'm not doing too good, man. They wouldn't be doing this if
[02:56:38.600 --> 02:56:41.440]  they're not planning something else. They're gonna probably shoot up some more schools
[02:56:41.440 --> 02:56:44.960]  and probably blow up some federal buildings to make themselves look like heroes.
[02:56:44.960 --> 02:56:50.800]  That's true. Hey, I'm a professional dog trainer here out of Dallas, Texas. And I was in the
[02:56:50.800 --> 02:56:55.760]  middle of one of my sessions the other day. And there was a lady, one of my clients, she
[02:56:55.760 --> 02:56:58.640]  had a problem with her dog jumping on the couch.
[02:56:58.640 --> 02:57:03.720]  That's a very simple thing to solve. And she kept telling me, she yells at the dog. She
[02:57:03.720 --> 02:57:07.640]  tried to get treats to reel the dog off into the floor. And I just simply went up to the
[02:57:07.640 --> 02:57:12.120]  dog and did a little, and just gave him a little poke and he got off the couch. He never
[02:57:12.120 --> 02:57:16.520]  got back on the couch again. And she was amazed at how quickly I trained her dog.
[02:57:16.520 --> 02:57:21.140]  These criminals are running wild. They're trying to intimidate us with all the weapons
[02:57:21.140 --> 02:57:25.160]  and stuff that we paid for. And they need to be put in line.
[02:57:25.160 --> 02:57:31.920]  Here's my point, Alex. This topic about our guns and the Second Amendment is not up for
[02:57:31.920 --> 02:57:36.120]  debate. The dog on the couch, we don't have a debate with the dog. We don't ask him to
[02:57:36.120 --> 02:57:40.680]  get off the couch. We are here to tell the government, do not take our guns. It's our
[02:57:40.680 --> 02:57:45.440]  Second Amendment. It's in law. It's in stone. We know our rights. It's not up to you. We
[02:57:45.440 --> 02:57:50.680]  don't belong to you. You belong to us. We pay our taxes for your salary. You got that?
[02:57:50.680 --> 02:57:55.280]  I agree. Everybody should call Obama and call all their media publications and get aggressive
[02:57:55.280 --> 02:58:01.100]  with them. Say, look, you gangster scum. You're not gonna run a New York operation here. You
[02:58:01.100 --> 02:58:02.100]  got that?
[02:58:02.100 --> 02:58:10.120]  We don't need to call them. They're listening to this right now. Better believe it.
[02:58:10.120 --> 02:58:14.380]  It's important to put it into action. Listen, if you're not an approved little protest group,
[02:58:14.380 --> 02:58:18.440]  they arrest you trying to hold a sign in front of the White House. They wanna turn America
[02:58:18.440 --> 02:58:24.120]  into North Korea. And I wanna tell everybody something. They're already shutting the economy
[02:58:24.120 --> 02:58:27.280]  off. They're already gonna shut your power off and increase the power prices. They're
[02:58:27.280 --> 02:58:31.320]  already gonna, listen, they just want the guns because they wanna get a physical fight
[02:58:31.320 --> 02:58:37.000]  going with us. The new world order has occupied America. The federal government is overrun

[02:59:52.240 --> 02:59:58.760]  Coast to coast, direct from Austin. You're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network.
[02:59:58.760 --> 03:00:12.760]  Big brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups. You want answers? Well, so does
[03:00:12.760 --> 03:00:21.760]  he. He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network. And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[03:00:21.760 --> 03:00:29.200]  Ladies and gentlemen, they're gonna devalue the dollar down to nothing. It's already started.
[03:00:29.200 --> 03:00:32.960]  Foreign countries everywhere like Germany are jerking their gold out of the Federal
[03:00:32.960 --> 03:00:38.640]  Reserve. Everybody knows America is run by evil. Everybody knows our government runs
[03:00:38.640 --> 03:00:45.800]  Al-Qaeda. And I wish that wasn't the case. But I am proud of Texas. We got state reps
[03:00:45.800 --> 03:00:47.960]  and federal reps fighting hard.
[03:00:47.960 --> 03:00:52.720]  Those articles are all up at Infowars.com. Obama's anti-Second Amendment executive orders
[03:00:52.720 --> 03:00:58.760]  may result in articles of impeachment. And we are putting out our own articles of impeachment.
[03:00:58.760 --> 03:01:04.580]  I mean, the people's articles of impeachment, that's what I'm gonna call it. Where'd my
[03:01:04.580 --> 03:01:09.320]  cell phone go? I was just, you had it with Watson out there on it. I gotta finish writing
[03:01:09.320 --> 03:01:10.320]  this with him.
[03:01:10.320 --> 03:01:16.200]  A German boondess bank to repatriate gold from New York Fed. Texas Congressman threatens
[03:01:16.200 --> 03:01:22.400]  Obama with impeachment if he uses executive orders on guns. New York State Senator gun
[03:01:22.400 --> 03:01:27.440]  bill passed in the middle of the night, turns law-abiding citizens into criminals. New York
[03:01:27.440 --> 03:01:33.920]  Senate passes draconian gun bill. Walmart forbids new ammunition orders. Yes, that's
[03:01:33.920 --> 03:01:35.600]  Chuck Schumer's order.
[03:01:35.600 --> 03:01:39.760]  By decree of the king, there are some steps that we can take that don't require legislation.
[03:01:39.760 --> 03:01:47.080]  I mean, it is just on, on, on, on, on. And folks, I mean, if they can take the guns,
[03:01:47.080 --> 03:01:54.660]  they can do anything. Man, it's gonna be like a new drug war. I guess you'll get your guns
[03:01:54.660 --> 03:01:58.200]  from the government in the future, like you get your drugs from the government.
[03:01:58.200 --> 03:02:03.400]  You'll still get your guns, they can lock up whoever they want selectively. But I guess
[03:02:03.400 --> 03:02:10.800]  you'll buy your guns from the corrupt police now. So ridiculous. Man, I have seen this
[03:02:10.800 --> 03:02:16.580]  from every angle. I know exactly where it's going. Who's up next here? Let's talk to Jed
[03:02:16.580 --> 03:02:17.580]  in Michigan.
[03:02:17.580 --> 03:02:20.840]  And you disagree with impeaching our Lord and Savior Obama?
[03:02:20.840 --> 03:02:27.520]  Yes, sir, I do. I don't think he should be impeached. I think he should be arrested immediately,
[03:02:27.520 --> 03:02:31.200]  thrown into chains, tied to a pole, whatever you wanna call it.
[03:02:31.200 --> 03:02:37.600]  He's a puppet, but his office is evil. And Obama does hate liberty. He is an authoritarian
[03:02:37.600 --> 03:02:42.920]  scum who thinks he's better than everybody. And you can see him, like he said, I'm not
[03:02:42.920 --> 03:02:46.560]  gonna act nice anymore. Now the mean Obama, when he has those little kids out there tomorrow
[03:02:46.560 --> 03:02:49.800]  though, he's sure gonna use them, isn't he?
[03:02:49.800 --> 03:02:55.920]  Yeah, he will use every single little avenue that he can. But every time somebody talks
[03:02:55.920 --> 03:03:01.640]  about impeaching him, it reminds me of an example of if a McDonald employee was to give
[03:03:01.640 --> 03:03:04.680]  me the keys in the middle of the night and I go in there and rob the place. And then
[03:03:04.680 --> 03:03:08.520]  they think about, there's a debate on whether or not the guy should be fired from McDonald's
[03:03:08.520 --> 03:03:09.520]  or not.
[03:03:09.520 --> 03:03:14.280]  And by the way, Obama wants background checks to buy bullets and is gonna make it illegal
[03:03:14.280 --> 03:03:18.080]  all your retroactive bullets. Look at the Washington Post right here. They're announcing
[03:03:18.080 --> 03:03:23.760]  all the evil that's gonna be announced tomorrow. Unbelievable. Obama to Unville, broad gun
[03:03:23.760 --> 03:03:32.320]  plan, including going after the bullets with executive orders. I mean, I'm sorry, go ahead.
[03:03:32.320 --> 03:03:37.360]  Two days after Ron Paul gave his farewell speech, and during his farewell speech, he
[03:03:37.360 --> 03:03:42.600]  said that he made a comment that the Constitution has failed. And I heard you agree with him,
[03:03:42.600 --> 03:03:45.760]  and I love you, man, but the Constitution has not failed, okay?
[03:03:45.760 --> 03:03:48.800]  We the people have failed the Constitution. And-
[03:03:48.800 --> 03:03:51.760]  Wait, I didn't say the Constitution's failed.
[03:03:51.760 --> 03:03:54.680]  You might have to go back, cuz I could have swore to God that you-
[03:03:54.680 --> 03:04:00.640]  No, no, I say all the time, people say the Constitution or capitalism failed. We failed.
[03:04:00.640 --> 03:04:03.880]  We're not following it is why things are getting so bad.
[03:04:03.880 --> 03:04:10.440]  We the people have allowed this to happen. I mean, at every point in time in history,
[03:04:10.440 --> 03:04:16.480]  we could have prevented this, but we don't have the fire under us, I guess, to do that.
[03:04:16.480 --> 03:04:22.080]  You know, when Obama gave a little speech saying that he's not gonna, don't worry, I'm
[03:04:22.080 --> 03:04:26.440]  not gonna come get your gun. I'm sitting there saying, don't worry, you ain't got the manpower
[03:04:26.440 --> 03:04:28.160]  to come get our guns, all right?
[03:04:28.160 --> 03:04:32.800]  There's 100 million of us. What are we gonna do? We don't even need guns. We can all just
[03:04:32.800 --> 03:04:38.360]  pick up stone, throw it at the same time, and that's over.
[03:04:38.360 --> 03:04:44.600]  It's just to order all gun owners licensed every five years. Bloomberg urges Obama to
[03:04:44.600 --> 03:04:51.120]  defy Congress, 54,000 Mexican sign petition to take our guns. My gosh, I mean, this is
[03:04:51.120 --> 03:04:56.720]  so bad. Feds delay arrest of illegal immigrant and registered sex offender working for senator
[03:04:56.720 --> 03:04:57.720]  until after election.
[03:04:57.720 --> 03:05:17.400]  They're a bunch of scum.
