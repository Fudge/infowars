[00:00.000 --> 00:18.600]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want to stop tyranny well
[00:18.600 --> 00:33.840]  so does he live from the info wars dot com studios it's alex jones don't you
[00:33.840 --> 00:42.440]  want to know why cnn's done a u-turn a 180 a bat turn and come out and said okay
[00:42.440 --> 00:45.760]  looks like it came out of the lab here's a headline we need to know how
[00:45.760 --> 00:50.600]  COVID-19 emerged so we can stop it from happening and ABC News saying well looks
[00:50.600 --> 00:57.920]  like it came out of the lab they knew 16 months ago there's no cell phone
[00:57.920 --> 01:05.160]  activity no cars nothing around the Wuhan virology lab in October 2019 they
[01:05.160 --> 01:10.280]  pretty much shut it down let's let's just recognize where we are we're not
[01:10.280 --> 01:16.400]  talking about bat caves in the suburbs right Wuhan is a major city in China
[01:16.400 --> 01:23.440]  larger than New York City no activity in for several weeks in October 2019 around
[01:23.440 --> 01:27.520]  the lab right so if you go to page 12 of the report it lays out the concerns
[01:27.520 --> 01:31.520]  about the activities that are happening at Wuhan and then the occurrences at the
[01:31.520 --> 01:35.720]  lab right before the virus breaks out and goes worldwide both the lack of
[01:35.720 --> 01:40.600]  activity and reports of individuals becoming sick this really shows I think
[01:40.600 --> 01:44.440]  of grave concern of both the activities that were there and raises a concern
[01:44.440 --> 01:47.640]  about u.s. involvement and then of course it goes to the bite administration
[01:47.640 --> 01:52.680]  being completely unwilling to continue to pursue the original origins of the
[01:52.680 --> 01:55.960]  virus a fact sheet released by the state department in the closing days of the
[01:55.960 --> 01:59.160]  last administration written by some of the same people who are doing the
[01:59.160 --> 02:03.920]  investigation the bite administration shut down told us that several researchers
[02:03.920 --> 02:09.360]  at the Wuhan Institute of Virology became seriously ill in the fall of 2019
[02:09.360 --> 02:14.120]  they had quote symptoms consistent with both COVID-19 and common seasonal
[02:14.120 --> 02:19.120]  illness three of them went to the hospital now that came out in January the
[02:19.120 --> 02:24.160]  American media caught up this week the Intel community confirmed it in a state
[02:24.160 --> 02:28.040]  of defox news state the State Department contractor that led that now defunct
[02:28.040 --> 02:33.040]  probe a man called David Asher reiterated that based on that investigation's
[02:33.040 --> 02:39.320]  findings so far quote there is probable cause for deep suspicion that the virus
[02:39.320 --> 02:43.560]  escaped from the lab in Wuhan and the Chinese government lied about it
[02:43.560 --> 02:48.000]  Virology says genetic fingerprints prove COVID-19 man-made no credible
[02:48.000 --> 02:53.360]  ancestor the big news is that there's six inserts created through gain of
[02:53.360 --> 02:57.520]  function research at the Wuhan Institute in the virus it's a bunch of its
[02:57.520 --> 03:04.000]  species of virus didn't naturally mutate into this a lizard does it mutate in you
[03:04.000 --> 03:11.160]  know in a million years into a giraffe with its whole different viruses
[03:11.160 --> 03:18.200]  different species of virus from the the the wild fused into one in a
[03:18.200 --> 03:24.400]  laboratory and as Rand Paul being a doctor when over the medical system of
[03:24.400 --> 03:32.160]  this they use natural animals to gestate it in to basically produce it in so that
[03:32.160 --> 03:35.920]  it would then not have all the markings of being made in the lab but it was
[03:35.920 --> 03:39.880]  spliced in a lab then put into animals to be produced in their blood and then
[03:39.880 --> 03:42.760]  strained out that's why it was like a slaughterhouse because it was just
[03:42.760 --> 03:48.960]  massive amounts of these viruses that they were purifying on preparing for the
[03:48.960 --> 03:53.360]  bio attack they then launched but humans are so strong and so healthy it
[03:53.360 --> 03:57.320]  didn't work on most people only old on the sick and the Chinese and we'll on the
[03:57.320 --> 04:01.440]  most toxic city in the world who already have destroyed lungs from the toxic air
[04:01.440 --> 04:06.680]  a lot of them did die and so then that was used to create massive hype and
[04:06.680 --> 04:13.960]  massive fear but it's all the timing of the release look at Fauci saying Trump
[04:13.960 --> 04:17.640]  will be challenged in the next few years by a massive pandemic when he first got
[04:17.640 --> 04:23.560]  into office and if there's one message that I want to leave with you today based
[04:23.560 --> 04:28.400]  on my experience and you'll see that in a moment is that there is no question
[04:28.400 --> 04:32.840]  that there will be a challenge the coming administration in the arena of
[04:32.840 --> 04:37.120]  infectious diseases both chronic infectious diseases in the sense of
[04:37.120 --> 04:41.640]  already ongoing disease and we have certainly a large burden of that but
[04:41.640 --> 04:46.760]  also there will be a surprise outbreak I mean they had the motive they had the
[04:46.760 --> 04:51.240]  background they had the history they bragged about it all right ladies and
[04:51.240 --> 04:55.760]  gentlemen it's Tuesday June 1st 2021 other special reports trade ahead and
[04:55.760 --> 05:01.120]  then I launched a massive attack against the globalist I always shoot you
[05:01.120 --> 05:04.600]  straight and when I've told you over the years that if you don't support us we'll
[05:04.600 --> 05:10.480]  be off the air it's been true but info wars has never been in a position where
[05:10.480 --> 05:14.720]  your support is more critical and more vital the enemy behind the scenes is
[05:14.720 --> 05:18.400]  doing so many things I'm not gonna take time up to whine about it it's okay I
[05:18.400 --> 05:22.520]  expect to be attacked because we're over the target we're having a great effect
[05:22.520 --> 05:26.360]  we're exposing evil you're exposing evil so you spread the word about the
[05:26.360 --> 05:31.080]  broadcaster when you buy products or when you pray for info wars and our talk
[05:31.080 --> 05:36.560]  show hosts and our crew it is so powerful so again as Memorial Day 2021
[05:36.560 --> 05:41.040]  comes and goes I want all you to realize that I appreciate you as being
[05:41.040 --> 05:44.760]  veterans of the info war and I particularly think our veterans as well
[05:44.760 --> 05:48.360]  serve the armed forces because they understand what it is to sacrifice and
[05:48.360 --> 05:52.760]  they're needed more now than ever to be leaders in our republic to expose the
[05:52.760 --> 05:55.960]  globalist of a foreign takeover that we're in the middle of right now so it's
[05:55.960 --> 05:58.600]  a very historical time to be alive I want to thank you all for your support and
[05:58.600 --> 06:01.400]  ask you to support us again
[06:02.520 --> 06:07.560]  from his central Texas command center deep behind enemy lines the
[06:07.560 --> 06:14.640]  information war continues it's Alex Jones and the GCN radio network it's
[06:14.640 --> 06:22.120]  Tuesday June 1st the year is 2021 and our globalist overlords now announced
[06:22.120 --> 06:27.040]  the planetary planet not just eat bugs and rick sewage water but to eat dead
[06:27.040 --> 06:34.600]  human flesh this is the artificial zombie apocalypse it is upon us is your
[06:34.600 --> 06:39.960]  mind really your own unbeknownst to the masses the campaign of mass mind control
[06:39.960 --> 06:45.320]  has been well underway longer than most people alive were even born between two
[06:45.320 --> 06:51.240]  ages this is 49 years old almost a half a century day and it's the blueprint for
[06:51.240 --> 06:57.400]  the for the the way in which the world has a reformed around technology the
[06:57.400 --> 07:02.960]  technocracy that exists today was predicted and ushered in by as a big
[07:02.960 --> 07:08.240]  new brzezinski all those decades ago and this is where we're at today in fact he
[07:08.240 --> 07:13.480]  predicted the socioeconomic breakdowns that the rise of technologies the
[07:13.480 --> 07:18.200]  direction in which personal privacy would be shattered and you know going back
[07:18.200 --> 07:24.040]  even further you know back to the 50s and the predictions in things like 1984
[07:24.040 --> 07:29.720]  right I mean it's worse than anything anyone ever imagined while the non-elite
[07:29.720 --> 07:35.120]  have been deliberately manipulated to have their own belief system deprogrammed
[07:35.120 --> 07:40.960]  and their natural lives altered and culled the control has metastasized all
[07:40.960 --> 07:46.960]  around us the mainstream corporate media are absolute mercenary trash who
[07:46.960 --> 07:52.720]  also hate the country and enjoy what they're doing and have absolutely no
[07:52.720 --> 07:59.960]  morals and literally have been hired because their profiles their algorithm
[07:59.960 --> 08:06.600]  their psychological signature their profile assessment is that they are
[08:06.600 --> 08:11.360]  psychotics or at least sociopaths and then you realize they have built an
[08:11.360 --> 08:15.840]  army of these people and put them in charge you see the tactic of subversion
[08:15.840 --> 08:22.000]  about which I'm talking is similar to the martial art if an enemy is bigger and
[08:22.000 --> 08:28.680]  heavier than yourself it would be very painful to resist his direct strike the
[08:28.680 --> 08:36.560]  Chinese and Japanese judo art tells us what to do first to avoid the strike then
[08:36.560 --> 08:42.880]  to grab the fist and continue his movement in the direction where it was
[08:42.880 --> 08:50.080]  before what happens here the target country obviously does something wrong
[08:50.080 --> 08:55.600]  if it's a free democratic society there are many different movements within the
[08:55.600 --> 09:03.320]  society that obviously in every society there are people who are against this
[09:03.320 --> 09:07.560]  society they may be simple criminals ideologically in disagreement with the
[09:07.560 --> 09:13.080]  with the state policy conscientious enemies simply psychotic personalities
[09:13.080 --> 09:18.600]  who are against anything but and finally there are small group of agents of a
[09:18.600 --> 09:27.680]  foreign nation bought subverted recruited right the moment all these
[09:27.680 --> 09:34.000]  movements will be directed in one direction right this is the time to
[09:34.000 --> 09:39.920]  catch that movement and to continue until the movement forces the whole
[09:39.920 --> 09:45.040]  society into collapse into crisis the progressive roots of the cancer that
[09:45.040 --> 09:49.720]  would lead America to Joe Biden after the elite had swindled the American
[09:49.720 --> 09:54.960]  public by creating the Federal Reserve System in 1913 it was key that future
[09:54.960 --> 09:59.560]  generations would be deprogrammed to accept the crime of the century an
[09:59.560 --> 10:04.880]  income tax that benefited the elite and subjugated the peasants and so the
[10:04.880 --> 10:10.160]  lies accelerated and poisoned Western culture British oligarchs use the
[10:10.160 --> 10:15.080]  Tavistock Institute to mold public opinion to manipulate the British and
[10:15.080 --> 10:20.160]  American public into accepting the notion that war with Germany was necessary
[10:20.160 --> 10:25.160]  in order to secure a lasting peace a sentiment at odds with the majority of
[10:25.160 --> 10:29.960]  the public that has been repeated ad nauseam following the birth of global
[10:29.960 --> 10:34.280]  financial governance by the IMF and the World Bank due to the Bretton Woods
[10:34.280 --> 10:40.720]  monetary agreement of 1944 and the collapse of the gold standard in 1971 in
[10:40.720 --> 10:46.880]  1972 the club of Rome published the limits to growth these dire predictions
[10:46.880 --> 10:51.480]  made about the future of civilization emboldened the elite to undermine the
[10:51.480 --> 10:57.200]  natural future of humanity in order to engage in genocide with quiet weapons
[10:57.200 --> 11:02.040]  for silent wars the globalist think tanks and media moguls that would take
[11:02.040 --> 11:06.840]  the reins from the Tavistock Institute to promulgate the history of propaganda
[11:06.840 --> 11:11.960]  and mind control over more than 100 years ago are too many to mention in this
[11:11.960 --> 11:17.840]  short report but the total control has become monolithic in 1948 the Smith
[11:17.840 --> 11:22.360]  Mundt Act was signed by Harry Truman and if you listen to that noise right now
[11:22.360 --> 11:26.720]  on to hear that rumble that's Harry Truman rolling over in his grave because
[11:26.720 --> 11:35.000]  what this is is in addition to the NDA of 2012 is to remove the prohibition
[11:35.000 --> 11:43.120]  against external foreign propaganda and it internalizes it and directs it here
[11:43.120 --> 11:50.080]  now the question we have to ask is what would be wrong with the State Department
[11:50.080 --> 11:57.520]  or the government basically providing what amounts to absolutely propaganda
[11:57.520 --> 12:03.400]  directed towards American citizens you were creating story there that's I
[12:03.400 --> 12:08.200]  think that's probably a chef sucker tell you how to report sir you know we
[12:08.200 --> 12:15.320]  expose everybody right comments are say we have it Anderson Cooper New York
[12:15.320 --> 12:19.840]  New York he's got nothing to say about Charlie Chester it is inevitable that
[12:19.840 --> 12:24.080]  the unyielding manipulation will have the same results for the elites puppet
[12:24.080 --> 12:29.440]  Joe Biden a progressive train wreck prophesized by broken US president and
[12:29.440 --> 12:34.560]  New World Order pawn Woodrow Wilson who finally realized to his own horror
[12:34.560 --> 12:40.880]  saying in 1924 quote I am a most unhappy man I have unwittingly ruined my
[12:40.880 --> 12:45.720]  country a great industrial nation is controlled by its system of credit all
[12:45.720 --> 12:50.760]  our activities are in the hands of a few men we have come to be one of the worst
[12:50.760 --> 12:55.600]  ruled one of the most completely controlled and dominated governments in
[12:55.600 --> 13:00.400]  the civilized world no longer a government by free opinion no longer a
[13:00.400 --> 13:04.920]  government by conviction and the vote of the majority but a government by the
[13:04.920 --> 13:09.880]  opinion and the rest of a small group of dominant men well at least Woodrow
[13:09.880 --> 13:17.800]  Wilson didn't read it from a teleprompter John bound ported excellent
[13:17.800 --> 13:22.520]  report that's why I started the broadcast whether we are your overlords it is
[13:22.520 --> 13:26.720]  headband on video in the John bound section clip the left-hand corner
[13:26.720 --> 13:34.400]  navigation bar click that link and it will take you directly to all the
[13:34.400 --> 13:39.760]  different contributors like John bound and others we are your overlords it is
[13:39.760 --> 13:49.520]  there to share okay here we are 13 minutes into this live Tuesday broadcast
[13:49.520 --> 13:55.120]  feels like a Monday because of the Memorial Day long weekend and I have
[13:55.120 --> 14:01.040]  been a very busy individual over the long weekend co-leading a lot of data
[14:01.040 --> 14:04.640]  and information about what's currently happening on the planet and what the
[14:04.640 --> 14:11.040]  globalist are planning next and I can tell you as I said last week as I said
[14:11.040 --> 14:15.640]  the week before they are planning the release of another virus to cause another
[14:15.640 --> 14:22.760]  shutdown and more fear but they're gonna have loosening of the restrictions so
[14:22.760 --> 14:27.720]  when the next bigger longer lockdown comes you will behave yourself and
[14:27.720 --> 14:34.320]  follow orders believing that someday the restrictions will be taken off and the
[14:34.320 --> 14:39.880]  restrictions will never be taken off I said that a year and a half ago and I
[14:39.880 --> 14:44.360]  stand by it today the real restrictions are still in place almost
[14:44.360 --> 14:50.400]  everywhere Matthew McConaughey has come out what a disgusting person and said
[14:50.400 --> 15:01.560]  that he wants us to wear masks forever just a Hollywood drug addict folks who
[15:01.560 --> 15:06.760]  does his fake smile we're all supposed to bow down to him let me tell you he is
[15:06.760 --> 15:10.520]  from Texas there's a lot of white trash from Texas so just might as from Texas
[15:10.520 --> 15:13.200]  that mean they should be our next governor and look he just his latest
[15:13.200 --> 15:15.760]  statements I've been on the fence about McConaughey because I can forgive
[15:15.760 --> 15:20.040]  people for being drug addicts all the rest of that nobody's perfect but there's
[15:20.040 --> 15:24.920]  just a little too much sorry I just went off on a jag there anyways the masks are
[15:24.920 --> 15:33.680]  gonna go forever ladies and gentlemen and we have to say no to it but I'm gonna
[15:33.680 --> 15:37.280]  break down the future of humanity if we don't stand up and take action we come
[15:37.280 --> 15:42.080]  back on the other side this is a really important broadcast they're all
[15:42.080 --> 15:46.920]  important but I'm in the zone and I am going to kick the globalist up and down
[15:46.920 --> 15:51.680]  the street we come back and lay out a blueprint to smash them forever it's us
[15:51.680 --> 15:59.640]  or them ladies and gentlemen this is war I'm Alex Jones stay with us the
[15:59.640 --> 16:03.880]  federal government commissioned secret radiation experiments on thousands of
[16:03.880 --> 16:09.360]  non-consenting patients hundreds of hospitals in the US injected healthy
[16:09.360 --> 16:14.640]  men women and children with uranium and plutonium at dosage levels ranging from
[16:14.640 --> 16:19.600]  non-therapeutic to lethal killing many of the test subjects
[16:19.600 --> 16:23.160]  blue print for global enslavement is one of the most important films ever made
[16:23.160 --> 16:27.120]  14 years ago we tracked and documented the boulderberg group's activities and
[16:27.120 --> 16:31.160]  they're planned for a great reset using the threat of a fake virus the film now
[16:31.160 --> 16:34.120]  is more important than ever when it's shot to number one on Amazon last year
[16:34.120 --> 16:38.760]  they banned it we have it back in print available now at info wars store dot com
[16:38.760 --> 16:42.920]  selling them as low as 395 a piece of the environment both and there's a zero
[16:42.920 --> 16:46.240]  country code so anywhere on the planet you can make copies in fact I want you to
[16:46.240 --> 16:52.080]  make copies you are the Paul Revere's 1776 worldwide 1776 worldwide in-game
[16:52.080 --> 16:57.520]  blueprint for global enslavement available now at info wars store dot com
[16:58.240 --> 17:03.680]  I've been on there 27 years and we've gone through a lot of criticism a lot of
[17:03.680 --> 17:07.560]  attacks but also a lot of amazing support and so that's why I always take
[17:07.560 --> 17:11.080]  time out to thank you for keeping us on there because without you without the
[17:11.080 --> 17:15.240]  crew without our sponsors without our affiliates without everybody we would not
[17:15.240 --> 17:18.440]  be on air and the world would be a different place so it's not a power
[17:18.440 --> 17:23.800]  trip when I realized the great effect we've had it's really counting the cost
[17:23.800 --> 17:28.920]  and in realizing that if we weren't here if you hadn't supported us the whole
[17:28.920 --> 17:32.880]  planet would be in a much worse position with the globalist instead a lot of
[17:32.880 --> 17:36.200]  really really positive things are happening and so many of the corrupt
[17:36.200 --> 17:39.840]  things the globalists have been involved in are now coming out in the open and so
[17:39.840 --> 17:43.840]  info wars credibility is higher than it's ever been but the enemy is trying to
[17:43.840 --> 17:47.040]  shut us down with so many different attacks we've had to build our own

[18:27.760 --> 18:43.080]  it's Tuesday June 1st the year is 2021 and I'm your host Alex Jones thank you
[18:43.080 --> 18:49.560]  for joining us okay let's go ahead and drill right into the big picture of why
[18:49.560 --> 18:57.240]  this is happening exactly what's happening and how we stop it here's a
[18:57.240 --> 19:07.920]  quote from 1984 published in 1948 and it was an analysis of what the Fabian
[19:07.920 --> 19:14.080]  Socialists running England would do if they were successful and merged the
[19:14.080 --> 19:21.560]  West with the Soviet Union and Stalin or well wrote essays and gave speeches
[19:21.560 --> 19:27.520]  before he died the next year he was at highest level of British intelligence
[19:27.520 --> 19:36.080]  there will be no curiosity no enjoyment of the process of life all competing
[19:36.080 --> 19:42.360]  pleasures will be destroyed but always do not forget this Winston always there
[19:42.360 --> 19:47.880]  will be the intoxication of power constantly increasing and constantly
[19:47.880 --> 19:55.920]  growing subtler always at every moment there'll be the thrill of victory the
[19:55.920 --> 20:03.000]  sensation of trampling on the enemy who is helpless if you want a picture of the
[20:03.000 --> 20:12.200]  future imagine a boot stamping on a human face forever now he's talking
[20:12.200 --> 20:20.000]  about the people that were able to take over and set up the CIA in 1947 the year
[20:20.000 --> 20:25.560]  he was writing this not the British people but the but the the the the
[20:25.560 --> 20:33.960]  Illuminati Jacobin satanic order the Hellfire Club and other names it goes by
[20:33.960 --> 20:41.840]  and what its plan for the world was if it got control now again Julian
[20:41.840 --> 20:47.560]  Huxley who died in 62 the memory serves he gave a speech in Berkeley in 61 when
[20:47.560 --> 20:52.360]  he was already dying and said I'm part of the same elite as George Arwell which
[20:52.360 --> 20:56.600]  was true even more so part of a secret breeding program was later declassified
[20:56.600 --> 21:03.200]  well back to the 1850s with Galton Wedgewood Huxley and others Darwin and
[21:03.200 --> 21:11.160]  he said 1984 is the old model to be phased out we're gonna make people love
[21:11.160 --> 21:16.680]  their servitude and use drugging and electromagnetics and inoculations to
[21:16.680 --> 21:22.200]  turn people into different species we're gonna make the act of having children
[21:22.200 --> 21:28.520]  via the womb obsolete with chemicals and we're gonna destroy the nuclear
[21:28.520 --> 21:33.360]  family and people will be so brainwashed from birth they will love their
[21:33.360 --> 21:37.160]  servitude but these are real speeches I'm paraphrasing them pretty much word for
[21:37.160 --> 21:43.880]  word you can go online and type in Huxley's all this Huxley's 1961 Berkeley
[21:43.880 --> 21:49.120]  speech and these weren't speeches against this these are speeches for this
[21:49.120 --> 21:58.720]  but but let me let me show you now where we are and and where they've taken us
[21:58.720 --> 22:04.800]  just just with some headlines look at this headline here out of the New York
[22:04.800 --> 22:10.600]  Post scientists suggest eating human flesh to fight climate change we didn't
[22:10.600 --> 22:15.360]  say that he said you must awaken to the idea we're all gonna die Magnus
[22:15.360 --> 22:21.080]  Soderlum and now a bunch of US states of legalized spring round up dead people on
[22:21.080 --> 22:26.680]  crops which is soil and green Swedish behavioral scientists as eating humans
[22:26.680 --> 22:31.920]  to save the planet the idea is your trash your garbage your a commodity you
[22:31.920 --> 22:39.240]  don't have any sanctity you don't have any connection to God don't value
[22:39.240 --> 22:43.720]  yourself in any way and once you don't stand up for yourself or others you're
[22:43.720 --> 22:49.320]  wide open and the social contract of Christianity and the Western ethos falls
[22:49.320 --> 22:58.560]  civilization falls and we're back in the Barbary days of conquest and dark ages
[22:58.560 --> 23:03.200]  which is what the Club of Rome and Deimos and the UN in my film in game I
[23:03.200 --> 23:07.800]  show the quotes and in the extras of in game I show the quotes and an in-game
[23:07.800 --> 23:12.480]  2.0 that's only at prisonplanet.tv we ought to find that in an air 2.0
[23:12.480 --> 23:19.240]  sometime it's actually on prisonplanet.tv now free the public is an archive and
[23:19.240 --> 23:23.960]  they said we're gonna get rid of science for the general public make
[23:23.960 --> 23:28.680]  everybody like beast and we'll even bring back human sacrifice not just
[23:28.680 --> 23:34.360]  gladiatorial death sport this is the UN committees voting to do this you know
[23:34.360 --> 23:41.280]  the UN committees unidire voted back in 2000 for total abolition of civilian
[23:41.280 --> 23:44.800]  ownership of firearms that's a quote
[23:44.800 --> 23:54.720]  the ownership of civilian firearms threatens the legitimate power monopoly
[23:54.720 --> 24:01.920]  of the state and should be abolished worldwide that's a quote it threatens
[24:01.920 --> 24:11.640]  the power monopoly what did Orwell say Paul Winston is torturing while
[24:11.640 --> 24:15.120]  O'Brien is being tortured to death
[24:17.640 --> 24:21.240]  both of them are being tortured death by the culture by the society by the
[24:21.240 --> 24:25.520]  civilization both the torturer and the torturer E. Paul Winston is being tortured
[24:25.520 --> 24:30.680]  death by O'Brien O'Brien says there will be no curiosity no enjoyment of the
[24:30.680 --> 24:35.040]  process of life all competing pleasures will be destroyed but always do not
[24:35.040 --> 24:39.960]  forget this Winston always there will be the intoxication of power constantly
[24:39.960 --> 24:44.480]  increasing and constantly growing settler always at every moment there will
[24:44.480 --> 24:48.960]  be the thrill of victory the sensation of trampling on enemy who is helpless who
[24:48.960 --> 24:53.880]  if you want a picture of the future imagine a boot stamping on a human
[24:53.880 --> 25:01.040]  face forever and that's why clout Schwab comes out and says you will eat
[25:01.040 --> 25:07.120]  bugs you will drink sewage you will eat water weeds water plants you will have
[25:07.120 --> 25:11.920]  nothing you will own nothing and you will like it robots will rule you you are
[25:11.920 --> 25:18.280]  obsolete they are just saying the most outrageous criminal things like hey the

[25:36.800 --> 25:41.800]  so you give up and I have a stack of similar articles going along with that
[25:41.800 --> 25:47.120]  here here's the Australian dot com the biggest newspaper in Australia Anthony
[25:47.120 --> 25:52.240]  Fauci backed virus experiments despite pandemic risk he said it was well worth
[25:52.240 --> 26:01.320]  it then he said Trump will be challenged the next three years by a virus that is
[26:01.320 --> 26:09.480]  going to be released and of course you saw all of that unfold we're going to be
[26:09.480 --> 26:19.920]  walking through it all for you today but they know what they're doing that they
[26:19.920 --> 26:23.080]  do things that are so horrible so evil a lot of you just go into a catatonic
[26:23.080 --> 26:29.560]  state a psychological fetal position others just try to escape it and try to
[26:29.560 --> 26:35.280]  deny it others join with the evil and then others of course decide to fight
[26:35.280 --> 26:41.720]  it because we will win we don't have any other choice in fact we will win

[30:44.880 --> 30:49.040]  very honored to be here live today all right now that I got into some of the
[30:49.040 --> 30:57.000]  motive in the last segment and the mindset of the Fabian Socialist who are
[30:57.000 --> 31:02.200]  the real governing model of the planet and I could do a whole another hour on
[31:02.200 --> 31:06.960]  that but I'll just leave it at that I'm gonna drill into the latest news on the
[31:06.960 --> 31:13.800]  COVID train going off the rails that is the globalist takeover to put China in
[31:13.800 --> 31:20.400]  the driver's seat that whole program is falling apart ultra massively and I'll
[31:20.400 --> 31:26.760]  be covering that today in the third hour Roger Stone is going to be joining us
[31:26.760 --> 31:33.000]  it became the number one trending news story over the weekend on Twitter and a
[31:33.000 --> 31:39.200]  bunch of other platforms Alex Jones Roger Stone Roger Stone Alex Jones say
[31:39.200 --> 31:43.440]  Trump to be indicted well that's what they're telling people in New York that's
[31:43.440 --> 31:46.880]  what the Democrats are bragging about doing is what Leticia James promised to
[31:46.880 --> 31:51.320]  do and it's what our sources said they're gonna do by pointing out this and
[31:51.320 --> 31:56.120]  pointing out it's political and pointing out that the prosecutor in New York is a
[31:56.120 --> 32:02.120]  Democrat fraud we're hoping to stop that so we're not coming out and saying this
[32:02.120 --> 32:08.040]  hoping Trump gets indicted and we're not just making the prediction out of hand
[32:08.040 --> 32:12.680]  but that's where this is going and and they've telegraphed to the next month
[32:12.680 --> 32:19.800]  and so what's a month out July 4th so on or about it may not happen Roger Stone
[32:19.800 --> 32:27.320]  was on this show a month before he got SWAT teamed with the indictment and he
[32:27.320 --> 32:32.360]  said I think within a month we can find the clip I will be arrested he was on a
[32:32.360 --> 32:37.440]  few days before he said I think it's imminent because he had seen it and
[32:37.440 --> 32:42.480]  others parked down the street from his house an FBI driving by all the time
[32:42.480 --> 32:48.640]  you know it gets a little obvious so that became a huge story Roger's gonna be
[32:48.640 --> 32:53.040]  joining us at the start of the next hour and it's perfect timing because he's
[32:53.040 --> 32:57.280]  been meeting a lot with General Flynn they've been giving speeches to groups of
[32:57.280 --> 33:02.640]  as much as 5,000 people every weekend and the crowds are getting bigger it was
[33:02.640 --> 33:07.280]  one in Jupiter that was 5,000 on the ground more than 10,000 boats for another
[33:07.280 --> 33:13.400]  big Trump won 2020 rally and that really angers the globalist and if Trump
[33:13.400 --> 33:17.760]  keeps pushing and goes ahead with these rallies he's got this month that we're
[33:17.760 --> 33:22.520]  gonna be yet by the way they are moving to do that as punishment because they
[33:22.520 --> 33:25.960]  stole the election and the idea that it's criminal for Trump to challenge the
[33:25.960 --> 33:29.360]  election when that's your right as an American when the Democrats do it all
[33:29.360 --> 33:36.400]  the time is crazy but General Flynn will play this next hour and get Stone's
[33:36.400 --> 33:42.440]  take on it was asked about Miramar who had a coup against the Biden Soros
[33:42.440 --> 33:47.240]  backed takeover and election fraud that clearly happened there and I've studied
[33:47.240 --> 33:53.800]  the case I'm not defending the military coup in completion but it's the same
[33:53.800 --> 34:00.840]  thing that we saw over and over again in Ukraine and other areas where Soros
[34:00.840 --> 34:05.040]  and the globals do overthrow countries and do regular elections hell we just
[34:05.040 --> 34:13.720]  saw it happen here in November of last year eight months ago and so that's up
[34:13.720 --> 34:17.800]  to those people over there but but but but it does look suspicious what Soros
[34:17.800 --> 34:23.760]  and others are up to and so I can't say I blame those people that's the wheel
[34:23.760 --> 34:27.720]  house the left has brought us into but now it was one of the other top stories
[34:27.720 --> 34:35.680]  over the weekend that Flynn called for violence when he didn't article at
[34:35.680 --> 34:39.920]  info wars.com by Kellerman green left calls for court martial of General
[34:39.920 --> 34:46.400]  Flynn after he suggests Miramar's foul coup should happen in the US which he
[34:46.400 --> 34:54.200]  didn't really do but he has a right to say that particularly because we've had
[34:54.200 --> 35:00.400]  a coup in this country and massive fraud and we've had Biden selling us out the
[35:00.400 --> 35:04.480]  foreign powers and opening our borders and illegally smuggling hundreds of
[35:04.480 --> 35:07.440]  thousands of women and children and others in and giving them to known
[35:07.440 --> 35:15.620]  smugglers so you you can't create this climate and then be surprised that
[35:15.620 --> 35:20.160]  things like this start happening and so next hour I'm gonna show you not just the
[35:20.160 --> 35:25.240]  articles but the videos here's one new book reveals General Mad Dog Mattis
[35:25.240 --> 35:29.520]  discussed secret military coup against President Trump while serving in his
[35:29.520 --> 35:35.960]  White House so did quote the Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein remember
[35:35.960 --> 35:42.120]  all that? Info wars reveal the 25th Amendment deep state coup in 2017 the
[35:42.120 --> 35:45.200]  illegal spying came out two years later that we were dead on right remember all
[35:45.200 --> 35:51.680]  that? Biden actually convinced military would engage in a coup against Trump
[35:51.680 --> 35:57.160]  seeing it so now you see him in a mild statement and oh my gosh it was one of
[35:57.160 --> 36:01.720]  the top trending stories he wants a coup arrest him court martial him people
[36:01.720 --> 36:04.840]  pointed out how he's out of the military he can't do that but then read
[36:04.840 --> 36:11.440]  state him and then indict him Flynn said let's be very clear and such a
[36:11.440 --> 36:16.080]  record straight on coup comment said that is not the case we'll get into all of it
[36:16.080 --> 36:22.760]  next hour but we've been under a globalist UN orchestrated coup and
[36:22.760 --> 36:27.080]  America's waking up to it and part of our intelligence agencies are aware of
[36:27.080 --> 36:31.640]  this and the general public's aware of it because they thought she did this in
[36:31.640 --> 36:35.880]  plain view and that's why they're in trouble they're very easy targets they
[36:35.880 --> 36:38.720]  want to keep the lockdown going in the West when it's not happening in China
[36:38.720 --> 36:42.240]  they want to go ahead and accelerate the end of the country and there are
[36:42.240 --> 36:46.000]  powerful globalist forces that want to keep the US somewhat strong along with
[36:46.000 --> 36:51.680]  the EU to have a multipolar world a tripolar world that they control from
[36:51.680 --> 36:59.200]  the UN level and so this again China file arm has this China centric arm has
[36:59.200 --> 37:04.160]  gotten big for its britches and so it's being brought down to size and Biden
[37:04.160 --> 37:07.160]  says in 90 days will have his intelligence agencies tell you what
[37:07.160 --> 37:11.640]  really happened when he was the one the first day he got in on January 20th to
[37:11.640 --> 37:15.960]  order Trump's Wuhan investigation was going on the State Department under Mike
[37:15.960 --> 37:21.960]  Pompeo to be ended and it is redonkulous how much evidence there is that they did
[37:21.960 --> 37:25.960]  it on purpose not just the scientific evidence not just the virus being made
[37:25.960 --> 37:30.520]  there not just Fauci running the operation not just them sending it out
[37:30.520 --> 37:34.480]  shut down society get rid of Trump bring in the world cashless system or I
[37:34.480 --> 37:39.520]  mean it's all there it's ridiculous Fauci lying saying I know nothing about
[37:39.520 --> 37:43.880]  gain a function using the racial testimony admitting he was funding it and
[37:43.880 --> 37:47.760]  do about what the vaccines would do they've pre-tested and pre-programmed
[37:47.760 --> 37:52.080]  this all and so off the study Fauci funded you can follow the trail and see
[37:52.080 --> 37:56.320]  what he was building my god this is ridiculously obvious completely
[37:56.320 --> 38:01.560]  transparent open and shut isn't a jury in the world wouldn't sentence him to
[38:01.560 --> 38:05.960]  life in prison for the conspiracy he engaged him with the UN and the Chai
[38:05.960 --> 38:11.440]  cons to take over the world they said to James Bond movie you go eat popcorn
[38:11.440 --> 38:17.360]  and have a nice cold Coca-Cola maybe some milk that's watching this is a real
[38:17.360 --> 38:20.760]  James Bond villain world and we're living in it and I'm not gonna be a
[38:20.760 --> 38:24.640]  spectator and just sit here with my thumb you know where I'm going to go
[38:24.640 --> 38:28.920]  after these people with information warfare and the truth and so are you

[38:33.760 --> 38:37.360]  gonna go to break I'm gonna come back and hit all of that huge developments but
[38:37.360 --> 38:41.440]  let me just tell you about this we're very excited about it people are really
[38:41.440 --> 38:45.360]  taking action we were in the red the first five months of the year because of
[38:45.360 --> 38:48.600]  bunch of our best-selling products were sold out some for six seven months most
[38:48.600 --> 38:51.960]  about five months supply chain breakdowns everywhere you hear about it the

[39:00.280 --> 39:03.760]  everything else well especially high-end supplements they have been

[39:23.960 --> 39:27.480]  in and the supply chain is continuing to break down so we're in a precarious

[40:07.680 --> 40:13.920]  admitted that roughly half of the CDC's top brass and workers medical doctors
[40:13.920 --> 40:19.200]  scientists nurses you name it have taken the so-called COVID-19 franken shot I'm

[43:56.320 --> 43:59.320]  patriot points check it out
[43:59.320 --> 44:26.320]  you're listening to the Alex Jones show
[44:29.320 --> 44:35.440]  all right my friends thank you for joining us on this live Tuesday
[44:35.440 --> 44:43.600]  transmission now I mentioned the Thabian socialists that came out of Cecil
[44:43.600 --> 44:48.040]  Rhodes and a model of the British Empire on how to maintain control of
[44:48.040 --> 44:52.280]  populations and how to dumb them down and how to finally exterminate them but
[44:52.280 --> 44:56.080]  have them love it and appreciate it and so they were funding all these different
[44:56.080 --> 45:01.000]  top scientists not just in England and Scotland and Ireland but in Germany and
[45:01.000 --> 45:10.000]  in France and in America to develop what they called mind war and here is their
[45:10.000 --> 45:18.760]  symbol it's a wolf tearing its way out of sheep's clothing in fact it's a wolf
[45:18.760 --> 45:27.440]  rampant meaning a wolf on the attack and they believe in survival of the fittest
[45:27.440 --> 45:32.520]  that you deserve to die if you're not smart and cunning and oppressing others
[45:32.520 --> 45:37.320]  now that creates again a conquest society dark ages causes the collapse of
[45:37.320 --> 45:42.800]  civilization Christianity and a emeritus based society meritorious where
[45:42.800 --> 45:47.520]  success is rewarded but also goodness is rewarded and being honorable and
[45:47.520 --> 45:55.320]  chivalry built civilization not this but but this is the cancer this is
[45:55.320 --> 45:59.800]  conscious cancer and George Arwell was allowed into the inner sanctums of this
[45:59.800 --> 46:04.440]  on record the highest levels of this because he was related to the five
[46:04.440 --> 46:11.320]  British families that were part of a secret breeding program under Sir Francis
[46:11.320 --> 46:19.920]  Galton who was developing ongoing plans from this man Thomas Robert Malthus he
[46:19.920 --> 46:24.440]  said crowd the poor together in tiny areas so the disease will kill them
[46:24.440 --> 46:30.000]  create licenses end the what is known as a nuclear family that wasn't called that
[46:30.000 --> 46:34.720]  then but in the classical family which is just a human group family it's any
[46:34.720 --> 46:38.840]  maybe all groups do it from Africa to Asia the ancient Meso-Americans
[46:38.840 --> 46:41.960]  everybody formed families once civilization started collapsing though
[46:41.960 --> 46:45.800]  they would always get rid of the family so that's a sign of the collapse of
[46:45.800 --> 46:49.520]  civilization and so they all had an exact plan and we're living under the
[46:49.520 --> 46:54.160]  21st century beginning of the end of the plan everything else has been beta
[46:54.160 --> 46:58.120]  test operational they could never get it fully in control because humans are so
[46:58.120 --> 47:03.640]  diverse and so powerful and amazing and we've defeated them a lot with Cecil
[47:03.640 --> 47:07.480]  Rhodes created the Rhodes Scholarship you wanted world government he created
[47:07.480 --> 47:12.440]  the CIA all of that on record this is all mainline history and you have these
[47:12.440 --> 47:16.120]  British files they're called Anglophiles they're not really even for England
[47:16.120 --> 47:21.120]  that took over the CIA and really set it up actually and if you go back to the
[47:21.120 --> 47:26.400]  CFR set up in 1922 at Pratt House in New York they were called Atlantics or
[47:26.400 --> 47:31.120]  Anglophiles and that's why all your first movies when they had talkies by the
[47:31.120 --> 47:36.200]  late 20s everyone spoke in a British accent you would affect a British
[47:36.200 --> 47:44.400]  accent or you weren't in society so that's the facts on that and so they set
[47:44.400 --> 47:50.440]  up a medical dictatorship a takeover plan and going back even 300 years they
[47:50.440 --> 47:55.720]  wanted to herd people into areas and have them die from disease just like they
[47:55.720 --> 47:59.520]  did the British troops did to the Native Americans and that's actually been in
[47:59.520 --> 48:07.440]  the famous dispatches from British generals to British colonels to that
[48:07.440 --> 48:10.600]  when the troops were dying of smallpox take those blankets and give them when
[48:10.600 --> 48:14.960]  they were freshly infected to the Native Americans so this is all an ongoing
[48:14.960 --> 48:22.400]  program so now let's move on from that to the news today just understanding who
[48:22.400 --> 48:25.280]  these people are where they come from what they're doing and of course they
[48:25.280 --> 48:28.840]  teach you about racism all day teach you white people are bad so blacks and
[48:28.840 --> 48:32.160]  whites kill each other while they're targeting everybody with a system they
[48:32.160 --> 48:35.200]  don't care what color you are they everybody in fact they they don't just
[48:35.200 --> 48:38.800]  take people they think are dumb or weak they really hate those they think are
[48:38.800 --> 48:41.760]  smarter than them and they want to get you while you're young and poison you
[48:41.760 --> 48:45.080]  with fluoride other chemicals and they all Bertrand Russell and others talk
[48:45.080 --> 48:49.120]  about that and he's hailed as a great liberal he said in the 40s we will give
[48:49.120 --> 48:53.760]  everyone injections to lower their IQ and of course he proposed fluoride in the
[48:53.760 --> 48:59.520]  water which they then did he won Nobel prizes you name it and you've seen 60
[48:59.520 --> 49:03.680]  years of fluoride I absolutely timing us down but continuing here's the
[49:03.680 --> 49:08.920]  Australian Anthony Fauci back virus experiments despite pandemic risk close
[49:08.920 --> 49:13.400]  quote so he did nothing about gain a function never was involved in it
[49:13.400 --> 49:18.320]  testified to Congress in 2012 that he was all behind it and 2015 moved it from
[49:18.320 --> 49:22.520]  Wuhan I mean moved it from Chapel Hill North Carolina to Wuhan and everybody's
[49:22.520 --> 49:26.360]  like Jones how'd you know this last year I had all the experts on it was he was
[49:26.360 --> 49:31.520]  in a controversy articles in 2015 in the Journal of Nature in the Journal of
[49:31.520 --> 49:35.560]  Science it's like saying Jones how do you know the Statue of Liberty is it
[49:35.560 --> 49:42.340]  Staten Island and then people go it's there he he he put he strike it he how
[49:42.340 --> 49:45.440]  do you know the Grand Canyon's in Northern Arizona well I've been there
[49:45.440 --> 49:50.160]  I'm oh my god it's there he's a genius this is what's frustrating me is everyone's
[49:50.160 --> 49:54.960]  like how does he know all this it's all right there
[49:54.960 --> 50:00.360]  ridiculous so sorry that's one article about a hundred let's continue heart
[50:00.360 --> 50:06.160]  inflammation blood clots and other dangerous side effects occur from
[50:06.160 --> 50:11.280]  COVID-19 vaccines a whole new giant prestigious study and of course it's
[50:11.280 --> 50:13.800]  being banned all over the world but they tell you it's safe and Maddy McConney
[50:13.800 --> 50:18.080]  tells you take it and it's so liberal and this is a very important article with
[50:18.080 --> 50:24.040]  some PhDs and medical doctors that's an info wars calm you may know this but
[50:24.040 --> 50:27.800]  your friends and neighbors and family don't this is emergency situation most
[50:27.800 --> 50:32.480]  people won't die from this right away they're gonna become debilitated which
[50:32.480 --> 50:38.040]  weighs down the civilization so you're like oh let those idiots take it we're
[50:38.040 --> 50:43.200]  gonna be wiping their butts for 50 years no no no that's why soft kills worse
[50:43.200 --> 50:46.320]  than a hard kill because it sucks everything out of society taking care
[50:46.320 --> 50:52.680]  of the infirm which then again makes society collapse and makes us finally
[50:52.680 --> 50:57.520]  accept mass euthanasia they're gonna make us accept survival the fittest by
[50:57.520 --> 51:02.160]  crippling us so we've got a kill off all the dummies that took the shots all the
[51:02.160 --> 51:06.920]  liberals want the free stuff that's why behind the scenes I've never had David
[51:06.920 --> 51:10.560]  Rockefeller do this I never had Fauci do it I never had Bill Gates to it but I
[51:10.560 --> 51:16.200]  had people right below them in off-regard discussions tell me all this tell
[51:16.200 --> 51:19.440]  me we agree with you we want to empower the public's bad they've got to be
[51:19.440 --> 51:23.160]  gotten rid of they're stupid and if the public doesn't believe me and does this
[51:23.160 --> 51:27.480]  see that's why this is all really to the globalist a big test I don't work for
[51:27.480 --> 51:30.800]  them I don't like them but they're like oh look at that old-fashioned goody
[51:30.800 --> 51:34.920]  two-shoes guy you know he can see what we're doing but he just doesn't have
[51:34.920 --> 51:38.560]  what it takes to make the hard decisions these are I've been given these
[51:38.560 --> 51:43.040]  speeches my dad was given them as well and it's not like it's even that special
[51:43.040 --> 51:46.960]  millions of people have been given the speech in the US and they joined with the
[51:46.960 --> 51:50.440]  dark side because they wanted to have value they wanted to count they wanted
[51:50.440 --> 51:56.560]  to be in on the wedding team but it's not the winning team it's satanic
[51:56.560 --> 52:01.760]  another big study about that Dr. Slam's COVID vaccine my patients are not
[52:01.760 --> 52:06.380]  laboratory rats to be sacrificing global vaccine experiment top New Zealand
[52:06.380 --> 52:10.560]  doctor very powerful video we'll get to after Roger Stone leaves us
[52:10.560 --> 52:15.200]  Wuhan lab staff were seen being bitten by bats covered in blood and wearing no
[52:15.200 --> 52:19.920]  protective gear in new video because it's a giant virus harvesting industrial
[52:19.920 --> 52:27.400]  site world's first case of human infection with H1ON3 bird flu recorded
[52:27.400 --> 52:32.480]  in China a new reason to freak out and run around crazy former State Department

[57:21.800 --> 57:27.920]  coming up with some really important information in the next two segments we
[57:27.920 --> 57:33.320]  are here Monday through Friday from 11 a.m. to 3 p.m. central and we have got a
[57:33.320 --> 57:40.040]  major move to try to demonize General Flynn and they've got all the talking
[57:40.040 --> 57:47.440]  heads was on every channel this weekend calling for him to be arrested for a clip
[57:47.440 --> 57:54.000]  will play next segment in Dallas this weekend talking about Miramar and the
[57:54.000 --> 57:59.120]  fact that there could be a coup here well we've had a globalist coup here with
[57:59.120 --> 58:04.000]  Joe Biden but now he's clarified that and we'll get to that with Roger Stone and
[58:04.000 --> 58:08.480]  also clarify what the media is thinking on a context with all the headlines
[58:08.480 --> 58:11.160]  biggest story this weekend it was literally trending number one on
[58:11.160 --> 58:16.920]  Twitter Trump to be indicted by July 4th and like we were happy about that like
[58:16.920 --> 58:21.520]  we were saying it like it was legitimate so Roger Stone will set the record
[58:21.520 --> 58:27.080]  straight coming up next segment but I had the crew put together just a short
[58:27.080 --> 58:32.400]  quick little compilation of Democrats well it isn't a short one we've got a
[58:32.400 --> 58:37.840]  15 minute one this is what two and a half minutes long coming out and saying we
[58:37.840 --> 58:42.720]  want to kill him the deep state's gonna kill him we want a coup against Trump you
[58:42.720 --> 58:49.720]  know he needs to go to a jail here are some of those headlines right here new
[58:49.720 --> 58:53.160]  book reveals General Mad Dog Madness because secret military coup against
[58:53.160 --> 58:58.600]  President Trump while serving in his White House in fours revealed 25th
[58:58.600 --> 59:02.720]  Amendment deep state coup in 2017 with Roger Stone the illegal spying that
[59:02.720 --> 59:07.240]  later all came out by an absolutely convinced military to be used against
[59:07.240 --> 59:13.960]  Trump so they all wanted the coup that they're now claiming General Flynn is
[59:13.960 --> 59:19.480]  pushing that is not happening so here's who's really been calling for coups and
[59:19.480 --> 59:23.240]  they did engage in one with the election and the election fraud that's now
[59:23.240 --> 59:28.240]  coming out here it is the risk of going to trial he's convicted that could be
[59:28.240 --> 59:32.280]  seen as an impeachable offense I don't see how that wouldn't be an impeachable
[59:32.280 --> 59:36.720]  offense that tweet fits the Republican definition of an impeachable offense
[59:36.720 --> 59:40.960]  where do you see an impeachable offense it is grounds for impeachment potentially
[59:40.960 --> 59:45.200]  criminal or even impeachable grounds for impeachment you may scapegoat Andy
[59:45.200 --> 59:50.240]  McCabe but you will not destroy America America will triumph over you that
[59:50.240 --> 59:55.120]  apparently directed for the president of the United States is it impeachable 100%
[59:55.120 --> 59:59.560]  is impeachable very substantial evidence that the president is guilty of high
[59:59.560 --> 1:00:03.440]  crimes and misdemeanor you take on the intelligence community they have six
[1:00:03.440 --> 1:00:06.960]  ways from Sunday at getting back at you as a former government official
[1:00:06.960 --> 1:00:10.360]  government's gonna kill this guy impeachments not good enough for Trump
[1:00:10.360 --> 1:00:15.080]  he needs to be imprisoned and placed in solitary confinement but for now
[1:00:15.080 --> 1:00:20.240]  impeachment is the imperative that's right I asked you tonight me is with so
[1:00:20.240 --> 1:00:24.680]  many people knowing about this it's interesting and I'm kind of proud to
[1:00:24.680 --> 1:00:28.640]  say this it took a member of the intelligence community to step up and
[1:00:28.640 --> 1:00:33.360]  bring it forward it's hard to imagine a set of circumstances that would have
[1:00:33.360 --> 1:00:38.840]  alarmed the founders more than what's on that call where you have a president
[1:00:38.840 --> 1:00:45.800]  using the full power of his office to try to effectively coerce a foreign
[1:00:45.800 --> 1:00:50.120]  leader that is completely dependent on our country for military economic
[1:00:50.120 --> 1:00:55.280]  diplomatic and other support to intervene in our election to help his
[1:00:55.280 --> 1:01:00.440]  campaign talk about pressuring a foreign country to interfere with and
[1:01:00.440 --> 1:01:05.600]  control a U.S. election it couldn't be clearer and that's not just undermining
[1:01:05.600 --> 1:01:10.880]  democratic institutions that is treason it's treason pure and simple and the
[1:01:10.880 --> 1:01:17.240]  penalty for treason under the U.S. code is death that's the only penalty I mean
[1:01:17.240 --> 1:01:20.720]  president only a four-year job but it feels like it's taking a five years to
[1:01:20.720 --> 1:01:25.160]  just fire his ass it's frustrating you know I bet somebody explain how long
[1:01:25.160 --> 1:01:28.880]  impeachment takes to John Wilkes Booth and he was like okay well where's he at
[1:01:28.880 --> 1:01:31.160]  right now
[1:01:31.160 --> 1:01:36.720]  when was the last time an actor assassinated a president
[1:01:37.720 --> 1:01:43.040]  the call is the call but there's nothing here that rises to the level of high
[1:01:43.040 --> 1:01:49.520]  crimes and misdemeanors whatever all right Roger Stokes will respond to this
[1:01:49.520 --> 1:01:56.720]  and a lot more on the other side stay with us on my own shows a lot of
[1:01:56.720 --> 1:02:01.000]  virtue signalers out there will tell you how much they care about troops and how
[1:02:01.000 --> 1:02:04.600]  much they care about veterans but at the same time they won't stand up for what
[1:02:04.600 --> 1:02:09.200]  those veterans and what those troops fought for the last 250 years of U.S.
[1:02:09.200 --> 1:02:13.840]  history and now more than ever what our republic stands for and it stood for is
[1:02:13.840 --> 1:02:19.120]  under attack America is under globalist takeover it's an information war it is an
[1:02:19.120 --> 1:02:24.960]  economic war but most importantly it is a spiritual war and now of course it's a
[1:02:24.960 --> 1:02:29.760]  biological and chemical war with the vaccines we were the first to tell you
[1:02:29.760 --> 1:02:33.040]  that the virus came out of Wuhan we were the first to tell you the vaccine
[1:02:33.040 --> 1:02:37.080]  passports were coming we're the first to lay out basically everything because we
[1:02:37.080 --> 1:02:40.000]  actually do our research know what we're talking about and that's why it's
[1:02:40.000 --> 1:02:43.520]  important to keep in force in the air now more than ever and for Memorial Day
[1:02:43.520 --> 1:02:46.800]  week we're having store-wide free shipping and double-patriot points a
[1:02:46.800 --> 1:02:50.520]  lot of great products are back at stock like DNA force alpha power and pollen
[1:02:50.520 --> 1:02:54.280]  block so to all the veterans all the pages we salute you and I want to ask the
[1:02:54.280 --> 1:02:57.840]  listeners please support it for worse now more than ever
[1:03:04.560 --> 1:03:12.000]  crashing through the lies and disinformation it's Alex Jones
[1:03:16.280 --> 1:03:22.720]  well I don't normally headline chase we tend to make the news around here but I
[1:03:22.720 --> 1:03:28.000]  win info wars is right in the center of the two top trends on Twitter and Google
[1:03:28.000 --> 1:03:34.160]  trends this weekend we're gonna respond to it because it's newsworthy because
[1:03:34.160 --> 1:03:38.880]  it's important we don't sit there when we talk about what the Queen of England
[1:03:38.880 --> 1:03:42.320]  eats for lunch and that's some top story we don't follow that big story but when
[1:03:42.320 --> 1:03:46.160]  it's important to America and the world and every man woman and child on this
[1:03:46.160 --> 1:03:50.440]  planet we do go there so I appreciate on short notice Roger Stone you know in the
[1:03:50.440 --> 1:03:53.800]  middle of his wife being diagnosed with stage 3 cancer last week and fighting
[1:03:53.800 --> 1:03:58.640]  that they have time to be able to join us here today on two big stories Flynn who
[1:03:58.640 --> 1:04:02.120]  I know that Roger and others have been talking to about running for president
[1:04:02.120 --> 1:04:07.120]  if Trump doesn't was in Dallas gave a speech to play a clip in a moment and
[1:04:07.120 --> 1:04:10.880]  was asked about Miramar on the coup there and could we have one here and he
[1:04:10.880 --> 1:04:14.800]  you know he basically just responded that yeah you could have one and you know
[1:04:14.800 --> 1:04:18.240]  maybe there should be one because because we've had a globalist coup and
[1:04:18.240 --> 1:04:21.480]  election fraud and you have the Democrats calling for all these coups and
[1:04:21.480 --> 1:04:25.360]  military calling for coups against Trump and spying on his phones and lying so
[1:04:25.360 --> 1:04:29.640]  they actually did that they tried the coup Rob Rosenstein tried the coup and
[1:04:29.640 --> 1:04:32.560]  Roger can respond to that well now they've called for him to be court
[1:04:32.560 --> 1:04:36.000]  Marshall he's come out and clarified what what he really meant by this but
[1:04:36.000 --> 1:04:39.560]  they're the ones that have been putting this out a hundred times a thousand
[1:04:39.560 --> 1:04:43.480]  times with Flynn ever even imagine they've been calling for our deaths my
[1:04:43.480 --> 1:04:46.880]  goodness not just trumps and then of course you've got the big story Roger has
[1:04:46.880 --> 1:04:51.200]  sources any smart but he lives in New York part of the year he's got his ear
[1:04:51.200 --> 1:04:56.200]  to the ground that they want to indict Trump by July 4th then around I've got
[1:04:56.200 --> 1:04:59.760]  the same sources plus Democrats are on the news saying it's a criminal
[1:04:59.760 --> 1:05:03.640]  investigation saying it's imminent and they know Trump's starting to go on the
[1:05:03.640 --> 1:05:08.840]  road and starting to galvanize you a good populist movement to continue to
[1:05:08.840 --> 1:05:14.360]  control the Republican Party so I think it's a very good call we made we're not
[1:05:14.360 --> 1:05:16.960]  saying we want it to happen we're not saying it's going to happen I think
[1:05:16.960 --> 1:05:20.320]  Roger's point he told me this week in him saying this is a great danger is to
[1:05:20.320 --> 1:05:23.960]  get a debate going about how this is political how it's a witch hunt to get
[1:05:23.960 --> 1:05:28.040]  ahead of it so that hopefully they don't or if they do we're not caught flat
[1:05:28.040 --> 1:05:32.280]  footed but that's my take on both of these stories that are binary that that
[1:05:32.280 --> 1:05:36.600]  orbit each other which one you want to tackle first my friend well let's go
[1:05:36.600 --> 1:05:40.880]  first to the fact that there is no question whatsoever in my mind based
[1:05:40.880 --> 1:05:46.000]  on my own sources that fabricated charges will be brought against Donald
[1:05:46.000 --> 1:05:51.440]  Trump in a Manhattan courtroom I never said that these that these charges were
[1:05:51.440 --> 1:05:57.040]  legitimate you I am reading between the lines the Wall Street Journal this
[1:05:57.040 --> 1:06:01.760]  morning essentially confirms our interview of last week which is they are
[1:06:01.760 --> 1:06:06.800]  going to allege either bank fraud or tax fraud these are fabricated politically
[1:06:06.800 --> 1:06:12.760]  motivated charges brought by Cyrus Vance Jr. an epically corrupt partisan
[1:06:12.760 --> 1:06:17.400]  prosecutor in Manhattan so basically what I think is about to happen is the
[1:06:17.400 --> 1:06:22.160]  president is about to be subjected to the exact same thing that I was
[1:06:22.160 --> 1:06:27.380]  subjected to fabricated and politically motivated charges a corrupted
[1:06:27.380 --> 1:06:33.560]  political prosecution a biased judge more than likely in terms of the
[1:06:33.560 --> 1:06:39.800]  Manhattan district and a smear campaign why are they doing this I think it's
[1:06:39.800 --> 1:06:44.120]  very clear first of all the announcement by the president that he was going to go
[1:06:44.120 --> 1:06:48.960]  out to on the road in June and July and start rallying the American people
[1:06:48.960 --> 1:06:54.800]  against the disintegration the decline of the country and the draconian
[1:06:54.800 --> 1:06:59.760]  authoritarian policies of the by administration in which one if one
[1:06:59.760 --> 1:07:04.440]  simply expresses their first amendment rights to disagree with the government or
[1:07:04.440 --> 1:07:08.400]  to question the anomalies or irregularities in the election or the
[1:07:08.400 --> 1:07:13.280]  safety of these vaccinations you are immediately branded as a domestic
[1:07:13.280 --> 1:07:18.480]  terrorist as a threat to the state and your civil liberties vanish they're
[1:07:18.480 --> 1:07:23.560]  allowed to spy on you listen to your phone calls read your emails so surveil
[1:07:23.560 --> 1:07:29.080]  you illegally and therefore I put this story out when I interviewed you Alex as
[1:07:29.080 --> 1:07:35.400]  a warning as a cautionary tale they want to go after the president because they
[1:07:35.400 --> 1:07:41.880]  fear that if his name is on the ballot in 2024 he will beat them yet again so
[1:07:41.880 --> 1:07:47.360]  this is an attempt to stigmatize of the the president to smear him when in fact
[1:07:47.360 --> 1:07:51.760]  I don't think he's done anything wrong if you read these stories the allegation
[1:07:51.760 --> 1:07:56.600]  is that he inflated the value of assets in order to borrow against them and
[1:07:56.600 --> 1:08:01.320]  therefore he is guilty of bank fraud nonsense the banks have their own
[1:08:01.320 --> 1:08:06.240]  appraisers the banks know what things are worth they are petrified about the
[1:08:06.240 --> 1:08:10.880]  political movement that Donald Trump heads and this is yet another effort to
[1:08:10.880 --> 1:08:17.600]  disqualify him from beating the Democrats yet again I know you've got a
[1:08:17.600 --> 1:08:22.000]  lot coming out on this prosecutor but I mean leticia James has joined it you've
[1:08:22.000 --> 1:08:26.320]  got the FBI joining it how do you have the southern district of New York which
[1:08:26.320 --> 1:08:31.120]  is admittedly political against Giuliani he used to head it up against
[1:08:31.120 --> 1:08:35.880]  President Trump presidents have always had immunity if they go after the
[1:08:35.880 --> 1:08:39.280]  president they're then retroactively opening up all these other presidents
[1:08:39.280 --> 1:08:44.080]  this is a very very dangerous road to be going down well the most amazing thing
[1:08:44.080 --> 1:08:47.920]  about that very powerful clip that you just showed Alex is that every single
[1:08:47.920 --> 1:08:52.240]  one of those public officials we have overwhelming evidence of both corruption
[1:08:52.240 --> 1:08:57.160]  and treason there is no question that with the Donald Trump is being held to
[1:08:57.160 --> 1:09:02.880]  extraordinarily different standard look let's be clear Joe Biden and Barack
[1:09:02.880 --> 1:09:07.160]  Obama illegally and unconstitutionally use the full authority of the US
[1:09:07.160 --> 1:09:11.440]  government and the capabilities of our intelligence agencies to spy on the
[1:09:11.440 --> 1:09:15.800]  president of the United States they have that's treasonous they should be
[1:09:15.800 --> 1:09:20.840]  prosecuted that's what mr. Durham was supposed to be doing my lawyers were in
[1:09:20.840 --> 1:09:25.280]  touch with the Durham prosecution we let them know that the only Russian I met
[1:09:25.280 --> 1:09:31.160]  in 2016 was an FBI informant and that they're nothing illegal transpired
[1:09:31.160 --> 1:09:35.720]  other than the fact that it was a setup mr. Durham has never responded the
[1:09:35.720 --> 1:09:41.280]  Mueller report glosses over the saying oh Roger Stone met with Henry Greenberg a
[1:09:41.280 --> 1:09:45.320]  Russian national but we have concluded that he wasn't working for the Russian
[1:09:45.320 --> 1:09:50.160]  State why didn't they mention that he was in the country on an informants visa
[1:09:50.160 --> 1:09:56.640]  signed off for by the Miami office of the FBI one of nine such visas paid off
[1:09:56.640 --> 1:10:02.640]  signed off on by the FBI but that doesn't get mentioned so expect nothing
[1:10:02.640 --> 1:10:08.640]  from mr. Durham that was that that was a holding action that was to a sage those
[1:10:08.640 --> 1:10:15.080]  Americans who are increasingly furious about the Russian collusion hoax so mr.
[1:10:15.080 --> 1:10:21.240]  Barr the attorney general also in on the coup as we now know basically threw us a
[1:10:21.240 --> 1:10:26.800]  bone by appointing a prosecutor who is going to do absolutely nothing about the
[1:10:26.800 --> 1:10:31.400]  overwhelming evidence of illegal activity by John Brennan James Comey
[1:10:31.400 --> 1:10:36.920]  Andrew McCabe Barack Obama Joe Biden Susan Rice and Hillary Clinton herself
[1:10:36.920 --> 1:10:42.920]  this list goes on secondarily the attack on General Flynn is because they fear
[1:10:42.920 --> 1:10:46.720]  him also because there is a growing groundswell saying well if president
[1:10:46.720 --> 1:10:51.080]  Trump elects not to run maybe general Flynn is the next white Eisenhower maybe
[1:10:51.080 --> 1:10:55.840]  he can be drafted I don't think he has any aspirations for political office and
[1:10:55.840 --> 1:11:00.800]  like most Americans he hates the dirty corrupt nature of American politics and
[1:11:00.800 --> 1:11:05.960]  what it has become but I also believe in my heart that he would do his duty to the
[1:11:05.960 --> 1:11:10.120]  country if that moment came we're not there at the moment so now they're
[1:11:10.120 --> 1:11:13.720]  attempting to discredit him by the way I don't believe you can court court
[1:11:13.720 --> 1:11:20.040]  Marshall a retired military officer who's no longer on active duty so this is a
[1:11:20.040 --> 1:11:24.800]  smear by the way the business insider has to be singled out as one of the worst
[1:11:24.800 --> 1:11:29.760]  pieces of crap on the face of the earth these guys are distortionists their
[1:11:29.760 --> 1:11:33.240]  propagandists but I'll tell you one thing they're most definitely not that
[1:11:33.240 --> 1:11:38.320]  would be journalists and let me just make this statement here I'm not gonna
[1:11:38.320 --> 1:11:42.600]  elaborate on it but a and we're gonna say any names but a lawsuit against the
[1:11:42.600 --> 1:11:46.840]  two of us is in the process of being dismissed there's one more hearing but
[1:11:46.840 --> 1:11:50.080]  the judge has signaled a dismissal of that so we'll be able to talk about that
[1:11:50.080 --> 1:11:54.280]  in the next few weeks so there there is a lot of stuff going on you've been
[1:11:54.280 --> 1:11:58.120]  attacked I've been attacked that's why we need your support we need your prayers

[1:14:08.840 --> 1:14:13.200]  the spiral censorship info wars has never been more influential and has
[1:14:13.200 --> 1:14:17.440]  never had a bigger effect exposing the global agenda and fighting it but that's
[1:14:17.440 --> 1:14:22.200]  said the covid lockdowns the shutdown of supply chains has almost shut us down
[1:14:22.200 --> 1:14:25.880]  because most of us selling products which you want to buy like DNA Force

[1:14:54.960 --> 1:14:57.200]  wars
[1:14:57.200 --> 1:15:24.560]  you're listening to the Alex Jones show
[1:15:27.920 --> 1:15:32.920]  I want to get to general Flynn and his statement in Dallas on Saturday that the
[1:15:32.920 --> 1:15:37.040]  entire corporate media is howling for his arrest including former generals I
[1:15:37.040 --> 1:15:42.400]  don't see how he can't be charged with treason for saying yeah Maramar had a
[1:15:42.400 --> 1:15:47.000]  coup maybe we need one here I mean there they called for a coup against Trump
[1:15:47.000 --> 1:15:52.240]  they they plotted Rod Rosenstein a bad dog Mattis in the White House we they
[1:15:52.240 --> 1:15:56.520]  legally spied on him as a candidate and as the president they engaged in trees
[1:15:56.520 --> 1:16:00.080]  and they work for Ukraine they work for Russia they work for China every damn
[1:16:00.080 --> 1:16:05.480]  thing they say about us Roderstone famously busted up a Russian spiring in
[1:16:05.480 --> 1:16:10.880]  the 80s he was the top lobbyists in the world that's quite a feat top lobbyist
[1:16:10.880 --> 1:16:15.520]  the world my gosh made a black cape with that but anyways the point is he's here
[1:16:15.520 --> 1:16:19.920]  with us now I want to get into Flynn more in a second but first people go well
[1:16:19.920 --> 1:16:23.880]  these mad dogs won't indict us a former president didn't do anything but they
[1:16:23.880 --> 1:16:28.920] 've shown they never think a several steps forward this is going to empower
[1:16:28.920 --> 1:16:32.760]  Trump this is going to enrage America this is going to turn the temp from
[1:16:32.760 --> 1:16:37.080]  boiling to exploding do you really think they're going to do it because like you
[1:16:37.080 --> 1:16:40.680]  said they're saying they are they're making all the noises they are will they
[1:16:40.680 --> 1:16:45.880]  really go ahead with it Roderstone you know Alex I really think that they will
[1:16:45.880 --> 1:16:50.800]  I mean clearly you saw the jujitsu that was attempted in the weekend media I
[1:16:50.800 --> 1:16:56.440]  mean our interview late last week was recycled neither one of us are allowed
[1:16:56.440 --> 1:17:00.760]  on Twitter but we were trending on Twitter the third time I've trended on
[1:17:00.760 --> 1:17:06.000]  Twitter since January not bad for an old man who isn't even on Twitter no they
[1:17:06.000 --> 1:17:10.600]  fear Donald Trump they fear the American people being behind Donald Trump and
[1:17:10.600 --> 1:17:15.920]  therefore I think the same kind of epic corruption you saw in my trial the same
[1:17:15.920 --> 1:17:20.840]  kind of epic corruption you saw in general Flynn's trial where they use
[1:17:20.840 --> 1:17:26.440]  trumped-up fabricated charges a biased judge a stacked jury and incredibly
[1:17:26.440 --> 1:17:31.000]  corrupt prosecutors they want to destroy Donald Trump they're not satisfied
[1:17:31.000 --> 1:17:34.560]  having cheated him out of the White House they actually want to put him in
[1:17:34.560 --> 1:17:39.400]  prison or kill him and it's ironic because you're absolutely right you want to
[1:17:39.400 --> 1:17:44.440]  talk about court-martials where is med dog Mattis's court-martial he openly
[1:17:44.440 --> 1:17:49.360]  called for a coup against the president he was involved in plotting one why
[1:17:49.360 --> 1:17:54.160]  hasn't he been arrested why didn't attorney general Barr arrest him when he
[1:17:54.160 --> 1:17:59.800]  was in authority oh that's right he was in on the coup as we now know and then
[1:17:59.800 --> 1:18:04.520]  also disappointing but I have to bring this up is the continued headaches of
[1:18:04.520 --> 1:18:09.200]  Steve Bannon let's be very clear not only did Steve Bannon steal the name of my
[1:18:09.200 --> 1:18:14.880]  info or show with the great American Owen shroyer the war room but he testified
[1:18:14.880 --> 1:18:20.880]  falsely at my trial against me he was an informant for Robert Mueller if you
[1:18:20.880 --> 1:18:25.400]  take his sworn testimony before the House Intelligence Committee which was
[1:18:25.400 --> 1:18:31.520]  sealed at the time of my trial and his testimony on the stand at my trial he
[1:18:31.520 --> 1:18:37.440]  clearly perjured himself in my trial so right now here today I'm challenging Steve
[1:18:37.440 --> 1:18:41.800]  Bannon to come on info wars and debate this let's have it out Alex you can
[1:18:41.800 --> 1:18:46.200]  moderate it so it stays civil but he needs to answer as to why he was working
[1:18:46.200 --> 1:18:50.880]  with Robert Mueller to destroy me and send me to prison so there it is the
[1:18:50.880 --> 1:18:56.120]  challenge the gauntlet has been laid down big Steve come on sloppy Steve we
[1:18:56.120 --> 1:18:59.760]  can find a suit and tie for you that's clean I think and you should come on
[1:18:59.760 --> 1:19:04.440]  info wars and answer what I just said and by the way all you little banding
[1:19:04.440 --> 1:19:09.120]  groupies who want to go on social media and challenge me I wouldn't suggest it
[1:19:09.120 --> 1:19:14.040]  because I will merely block you facts are facts as the New York Post reported
[1:19:14.040 --> 1:19:18.580]  and Jonathan Turley the George Washington University law professor who read
[1:19:18.580 --> 1:19:23.920]  both transcripts and concluded Bannon clearly perjured himself at one place
[1:19:23.920 --> 1:19:29.560]  or the other and since the entire central question on which I was being tried
[1:19:29.560 --> 1:19:34.000]  was lying to the House Committee you would think that it would be germane it
[1:19:34.000 --> 1:19:38.400]  would be important as professor Turley pointed out there were 40 lawyers in the
[1:19:38.400 --> 1:19:44.000]  room at the time that Bannon testified prior pardon me contrary Roger you're
[1:19:44.000 --> 1:19:47.560]  fired up please go back at this in a moment but you just you just brought
[1:19:47.560 --> 1:19:51.480]  this in shocking great idea I don't know if you got the idea because Barnes and
[1:19:51.480 --> 1:19:55.360]  point has had a great debate with over a million people that tuned in to that
[1:19:55.360 --> 1:19:58.800]  show and about a million have watched it since it banned our video so that's
[1:19:58.800 --> 1:20:02.640]  pretty successful I want to have debates I would let Bannon have his
[1:20:02.640 --> 1:20:06.520]  moderator here as well we could we could agree upon rules I want to have debates
[1:20:06.520 --> 1:20:10.640]  Bannon's been saying some nice things about me and I used to admire him you
[1:20:10.640 --> 1:20:14.400]  used to say great things off air about him and on air I know you like you were
[1:20:14.400 --> 1:20:21.080]  shocked by this and but I think he really should come on and debate you I
[1:20:21.080 --> 1:20:25.480]  mean let's go back to used to really like Bannon why are you saying he did
[1:20:25.480 --> 1:20:30.760]  this to you well I have to assume that he did it because as we now know he was
[1:20:30.760 --> 1:20:35.560]  under federal investigation at the time he testified against me the
[1:20:35.560 --> 1:20:40.920]  prosecutors had a legal obligation under Giglio to tell us that at the time of
[1:20:40.920 --> 1:20:44.440]  his prosecution but of course they didn't do so my case could have been
[1:20:44.440 --> 1:20:50.320]  overturned on that basis alone had I not been pardoned but once I waved my right
[1:20:50.320 --> 1:20:55.240]  to a to an appeal because I knew an appeal in the DC circuit was hopeless
[1:20:55.240 --> 1:20:59.800]  neither the law nor the Constitution matters to virtually any judge in that
[1:20:59.800 --> 1:21:04.440]  circuit that opportunity was lost but he should not continue to be able to put
[1:21:04.440 --> 1:21:09.720]  himself forward as an advocate for the America first agenda Steve Bannon
[1:21:09.720 --> 1:21:13.640]  publicly accused the president of having Alzheimer's he said the Trump
[1:21:13.640 --> 1:21:18.520]  organization was a criminal enterprise he said that Trump would be prosecuted I
[1:21:18.520 --> 1:21:21.720]  can do this almost verbatim when the American people learn he's not a
[1:21:21.720 --> 1:21:25.680]  billionaire he's just another scumbag let me ask you this I mean do we know all
[1:21:25.680 --> 1:21:29.880]  that was really said or just a media claim that I'm sorry say it again do we
[1:21:29.880 --> 1:21:32.600]  know we really said all that or just the media said that because the media claims
[1:21:32.600 --> 1:21:38.120]  that that is reported by the Guardian it's also in the book a fast and furious
[1:21:38.120 --> 1:21:42.120]  way and he's never denied it his his defenders say oh well that was two years
[1:21:42.120 --> 1:21:45.800]  ago doesn't matter when it was Steve Bannon called the president of the
[1:21:45.800 --> 1:21:49.560]  United here's the 64 trillion dollar question why did Trump give him a
[1:21:49.560 --> 1:21:54.600]  pardon I think he was blackmailed that's what I think that is my opinion but
[1:21:54.600 --> 1:22:00.000]  again I noticed that in Chinese Steve Bannon's patron Miles Kwok last week
[1:22:00.000 --> 1:22:04.760]  in an interview in the Chinese language but with subtitles accused Patrick
[1:22:04.760 --> 1:22:09.160]  Byrne who I think has been a hero in this entire recourse of being a red
[1:22:09.160 --> 1:22:14.000]  Chinese agent because he once lived in China many years ago Patrick Byrne is a
[1:22:14.000 --> 1:22:19.080]  patriot and I think Mr. Kwok just defamed him just an observation I know this I've
[1:22:19.080 --> 1:22:24.160]  seen the trailer for their new film deep rig that's it manned out video it looks
[1:22:24.160 --> 1:22:29.080]  like the slickest thing I ever saw well I think it's I think it is a factual look
[1:22:29.080 --> 1:22:33.120]  and that is why they are running a campaign of censorship and deep
[1:22:33.120 --> 1:22:36.880]  platforming and control oh absolutely the proof is there of the fraud but man
[1:22:36.880 --> 1:22:41.680]  it's just a production quality looks better than HBO Roger I do five more
[1:22:41.680 --> 1:22:44.520]  minutes with me because I want to get into Flynn and drafting him if Trump

[1:24:43.080 --> 1:24:59.920]  I always shoot you straight and when I've told you over the years that if you don't support us, we'll be off the air. It's been true
[1:25:00.320 --> 1:25:06.720]  But info wars has never been in a position where your support is more critical and more vital
[1:25:06.720 --> 1:25:11.280]  The enemy behind the scenes is doing so many things. I'm not gonna take time up to whine about it
[1:25:11.280 --> 1:25:16.160]  It's okay. I expect to be attacked because we're over the target. We're having a great effect
[1:25:16.160 --> 1:25:18.600]  We're exposing evil. You're exposing evil
[1:25:18.600 --> 1:25:23.400]  So you spread the word about the broadcaster when you buy products or when you pray for info wars and
[1:25:23.680 --> 1:25:27.560]  Our talk show hosts and our crew it is so powerful
[1:25:27.560 --> 1:25:31.360]  So again as Memorial Day 2021 comes and goes
[1:25:31.360 --> 1:25:37.920]  I want all you to realize that I appreciate you as being veterans of the info war and I particularly think our veterans as well
[1:25:37.920 --> 1:25:42.600]  To serve the armed forces because they understand what it is to sacrifice and they're needed
[1:25:42.760 --> 1:25:49.000]  More now than ever to be leaders in our Republic to expose the globalism of foreign takeover that we're in the middle of right now
[1:25:49.000 --> 1:25:53.160]  So it's a very historical time to be alive. I want to thank you all for your support and ask you to support us again
[1:25:53.160 --> 1:26:00.760]  We here at info wars are proud to announce the first-ever kava kava root supplement that is now available at info wars store
[1:26:00.760 --> 1:26:08.520]  Dot com kava is one of the hottest new breakthroughs in the natural health world today though it has been used for hundreds of years in the
[1:26:08.520 --> 1:26:14.280]  Pacific Islands for its relaxation and euphoric effects according to ancient Samoan legend
[1:26:14.280 --> 1:26:20.680]  Kava was given as a gift by the Sun God Tagaloa who they considered to be the supreme ruler and
[1:26:20.920 --> 1:26:28.280]  Creator of the universe the Samoan people would drink kava tea during social gatherings and sacred ceremonies to loosen up a little
[1:26:28.280 --> 1:26:34.880]  Nowadays kava is used around the world by many who enjoy its serious benefits the new kava chill by dr.

[1:26:59.560 --> 1:27:01.560]  Oh
[1:27:21.600 --> 1:27:28.800]  Mondays or Fridays from 8 a.m. To 11 a.m.. It's Harrison Smith an American journal right here on the info wars network
[1:27:28.800 --> 1:27:36.960]  Samo cast by GCN radio network and then of course you've got your truly Alice Jones 11 a.m. To 3 p.m. Central and then the great war room
[1:27:37.240 --> 1:27:43.160]  With Owen shroyer formerly his talk show host Roger Stone who got indicted and barred from being on air
[1:27:43.280 --> 1:27:46.520]  So he can no longer be a talk show host and now Roger
[1:27:46.880 --> 1:27:52.280]  Is so busy just taking care of his wife at a stage 3 cancer and also battling all the new attempts to put him in prison
[1:27:52.280 --> 1:27:55.600]  But he's unable to join us five days a week, but he has been able to join us
[1:27:55.600 --> 1:27:58.920]  Last Friday the it was the top story
[1:27:59.360 --> 1:28:02.840]  Everywhere is on all the news channels the number one on Twitter over the weekend
[1:28:03.280 --> 1:28:08.240]  Spending it that oh we wanted to be arrested Trump deserves to be arrested Trump will be arrested
[1:28:08.720 --> 1:28:14.400]  For fraud we said no such thing and now you have the very group that said
[1:28:15.000 --> 1:28:21.720]  Habakkuk against Trump that spotty legally against Trump that worked with foreign governments like Ukraine against Trump and others
[1:28:21.720 --> 1:28:28.500]  Saying a rest Flynn put him in jail. They're all over the news. Here's what Flynn really said in Dallas this weekend
[1:28:29.800 --> 1:28:32.800]  I'm a simple marine. I want to know why
[1:28:32.800 --> 1:28:53.080]  What happened in Minomar can't happen here? You know, yeah, no reason
[1:28:53.080 --> 1:28:58.960]  So
[1:28:58.960 --> 1:29:01.440]  It's hyperbole. They're all up there
[1:29:01.440 --> 1:29:07.160]  Roger you were here at the start when I heard that two-and-a-half minute compilation that will post this whole interview later when it's not live
[1:29:07.360 --> 1:29:10.560]  So people can see it at manda video and it was two-and-a-half minutes
[1:29:10.560 --> 1:29:14.720]  We have a 14 minute long and I didn't want to play that because you were here of them saying kill him
[1:29:15.000 --> 1:29:20.760]  Spy on him arrest his family put him in prison have a military coup and this was Democrat leaders
[1:29:20.760 --> 1:29:27.560]  Some of which are sitting in Congress saying this so what they said is a thousand times literally
[1:29:28.280 --> 1:29:34.160]  Orders of magnitude bigger than what Flynn said, but but their tone death of the hypocrisy
[1:29:35.640 --> 1:29:37.640]  You know Alex I
[1:29:37.760 --> 1:29:43.920]  Developed really a telephone relationship with General Flynn because I was going through a epic trial at the same time
[1:29:43.920 --> 1:29:46.400]  He was and we were essentially being persecuted
[1:29:46.400 --> 1:29:52.560]  By the same people at the same time, but I didn't really get to know him until more recently
[1:29:52.560 --> 1:29:57.760]  We recently had three hours together. I must tell you he is a good man. He is a man of destiny
[1:29:58.160 --> 1:30:04.800]  He is a man who believes in God. He is a man who understands his duty to his country and that flip comment
[1:30:04.800 --> 1:30:12.000]  I don't think compares or even even approaches the epic corruption of people like Adam Schiff or
[1:30:12.000 --> 1:30:19.640]  General Mattis or Maxine waters. I mean in all honesty Maxine waters pressures the government to bail out a bank that
[1:30:19.640 --> 1:30:25.280]  She and her husband own stock in in which he's a member of the board up if she were a white Republican
[1:30:25.280 --> 1:30:29.140]  She'd be in prison right now, but they are held to a different standard
[1:30:29.200 --> 1:30:36.440]  Why are they smearing General Flynn because he's a man of destiny because they know that if President Trump my first choice for president
[1:30:36.440 --> 1:30:38.560]  I want to be clear. I'm for Donald Trump
[1:30:38.560 --> 1:30:43.640]  They could be our strongest candidate, but if we're ever whatever reason he elects not to run
[1:30:43.800 --> 1:30:48.480]  Then I think the people need to draft general Flynn the way they have drafted Dwight Eisenhower
[1:30:48.720 --> 1:30:52.520]  So this is a smear on a truly great American
[1:30:53.000 --> 1:30:59.080]  When his critics have said far far far worse than he has said it is outrageous
[1:30:59.320 --> 1:31:07.360]  But it's also typical. It's a perfect example of the two-edged sword the the two-tiered justice system on the day
[1:31:07.360 --> 1:31:13.080]  That I was convicted the prosecutor in my case who at that point was also the prosecutor
[1:31:13.480 --> 1:31:20.000]  Potentially of Andrew McCabe announced that there would be no charges brought against McCabe for lying to the FBI in
[1:31:20.200 --> 1:31:23.840]  Covering up essentially operation crossfire hurricane
[1:31:24.320 --> 1:31:29.800]  Meanwhile, we're waiting for the Durham at a report. Where is that? Mr. Durham?
[1:31:29.800 --> 1:31:32.520]  I mean in the Mueller report they
[1:31:32.520 --> 1:31:41.120]  Correctly reported that I was approached by a Russian national in 2016 who offered to sell me dirt on Hillary Clinton
[1:31:41.120 --> 1:31:47.200]  I turned him down flat, but the Mueller report says there's no evidence that he was working for the Russian government
[1:31:47.200 --> 1:31:51.880]  No, there isn't because he was working for the FBI because we have a copy of his
[1:31:52.360 --> 1:31:57.160]  His visa that was assigned off on by the FBI office in Miami
[1:31:57.160 --> 1:32:04.420]  He was here as an FBI informant. He approached me as an FBI informant, but that's not included in Mr.
[1:32:04.420 --> 1:32:11.680]  Mueller's report and when my lawyer sent that information to mr. Durham, we got no response whatsoever none
[1:32:11.840 --> 1:32:17.000]  So that's right. They're running around saying in congressional hearings that I was a Russian agent
[1:32:17.000 --> 1:32:22.680]  I mean this is hundreds of times, but McCarthy did most of the time he called real communist in and then grilled him
[1:32:22.680 --> 1:32:26.440]  It was still looked a little un-American. We now know it was actually he was dead on
[1:32:26.440 --> 1:32:32.440]  But but everything they ever accused McCarthy of or Nixon out of the red scare is what they've now done
[1:32:33.480 --> 1:32:35.480]  Again way way more intense
[1:32:35.920 --> 1:32:39.920]  No, this is right out of the linsky's, you know rules for radicals always
[1:32:40.280 --> 1:32:45.800]  Accuses your opponents of that which you yourself are doing. They are the ones engaged in truisin
[1:32:45.800 --> 1:32:52.680]  They're the ones who got caught in a massive abuse of power in which they use the authority of the US government and the
[1:32:52.680 --> 1:32:59.720]  Capability of our intelligence agencies to spy on Donald Trump even Richard Nixon didn't do that the Watergate break-in was stupid
[1:32:59.720 --> 1:33:04.000]  But it was done by private individuals. This is ten times worse
[1:33:04.000 --> 1:33:08.720]  This is an abuse of power that is greater than anything we have ever seen in American history
[1:33:09.040 --> 1:33:12.680]  Trump is right. This is the greatest political scandal in our history
[1:33:12.720 --> 1:33:18.240]  So you have to always take a grain of salt when you read the mainstream media and again
[1:33:18.240 --> 1:33:24.480]  I want to point it out the business insider is the single most inaccurate insidious vicious
[1:33:25.480 --> 1:33:30.920]  Propagandist distortionist website out there. How are they because there were so many hundreds of articles I couldn't read them all
[1:33:30.920 --> 1:33:34.320]  I mean, how are they the worst out of that field of disinfo?
[1:33:34.840 --> 1:33:39.760]  It's really hard when you throw in salon and vice and the rest of these other
[1:33:40.800 --> 1:33:42.800]  Jerks clean that up. Sorry
[1:33:42.800 --> 1:33:50.160]  But but it's just malicious in what they report because there's no accuracy. There are no longer standards
[1:33:50.160 --> 1:33:54.640]  Let me be very clear. I've been in American politics for 40 years
[1:33:54.840 --> 1:33:59.360]  Here's how it works when a journalist is about going to write about a person
[1:33:59.360 --> 1:34:05.960]  It is a journalistic rule that you call that person and you give them an opportunity to respond on the record
[1:34:05.960 --> 1:34:11.660]  They don't have to respond, but you're supposed to give them the opportunity. We both should have gotten hundreds of calls
[1:34:11.660 --> 1:34:14.000]  We both got zero or at least I didn't get any goals
[1:34:14.440 --> 1:34:19.680]  Of course not because they just write a fabricated narrative that is false now
[1:34:19.680 --> 1:34:24.840]  I'm not obligated to respond but for example, there's a story in the business insider that says
[1:34:25.280 --> 1:34:30.520]  Jason Sullivan former advisor to Donald Trump calls for the hanging of Hillary Clinton
[1:34:30.520 --> 1:34:33.720]  Well, Jason Sullivan was not a media advisor for me
[1:34:33.800 --> 1:34:36.160]  He was hired by someone who worked for me
[1:34:36.160 --> 1:34:44.280]  Because he allegedly had proprietary technology that could be used to maximize the value of your Twitter feed in fact
[1:34:44.480 --> 1:34:50.600]  This violated Twitter's rules and ended up with every single person. I was following being
[1:34:51.080 --> 1:34:56.680]  Unfollowed and he was fired after 30 days. No, he's not an associate of mine
[1:34:56.800 --> 1:35:01.280]  No, I am not responsible for anything he has to say and in this case
[1:35:01.280 --> 1:35:08.680]  I urge Sidney Powell not to allow him to speak according to Reuters. He was among those who testified against me at the grand jury
[1:35:08.680 --> 1:35:15.360]  I don't know that independently. Sure. The point is this is the media just absolutely twist and lies at levels number 14
[1:35:15.560 --> 1:35:20.080]  Roger, I appreciate your time in closing in 30 seconds and then I've got one point
[1:35:20.080 --> 1:35:24.240]  I want to make what can Trump do to get out ahead of their attempt to indict him
[1:35:24.240 --> 1:35:28.620]  I mean, he ought to go have a rally in New York or something and just get in the face of this lie
[1:35:28.620 --> 1:35:32.700]  Well, first of all, I think he needs to be aware that this is happening
[1:35:32.700 --> 1:35:37.780]  The one of the main reasons that I said this on your show last week is as a as a warning as a
[1:35:38.460 --> 1:35:41.620]  Questionary tale so people understood that what was about to happen
[1:35:42.260 --> 1:35:48.100]  You know, this would be this would be unique in our history that a former president would be harassed
[1:35:48.900 --> 1:35:54.860]  But if that were the case then George W. Bush could be tried right now for war crimes, but that isn't going to happen
[1:35:54.860 --> 1:36:00.580]  So I think the president needs to speak out now and point out the American people that this is a fraud
[1:36:00.580 --> 1:36:06.140]  This is a politically motivated completely fabricated bogus prosecution
[1:36:06.140 --> 1:36:10.020]  Which I am absolutely convinced is coming because they fear Donald Trump
[1:36:10.020 --> 1:36:15.660]  They don't want his name on the ballot again because they know how beloved he is by the American people
[1:36:15.660 --> 1:36:21.660]  I went to this Memorial Day boat parade in Jupiter, Florida. This is months after the election
[1:36:21.660 --> 1:36:25.620]  I've never seen anything like this the outpouring of love and paper
[1:36:25.620 --> 1:36:30.940]  And that's why they want to go after him to discredit the fact that he is still the leader of the Republican Party real fast
[1:36:30.940 --> 1:36:34.700]  Because I know you've lost everything and I'm gonna support you and your wife and keep you in the fight Roger
[1:36:34.860 --> 1:36:40.460]  How do people go make a donation for your wife some massive bills now that they've already bankrupted you now
[1:36:40.460 --> 1:36:47.180]  She's got stage three cancer go to stone family fund calm stone family fund calm
[1:36:47.180 --> 1:36:53.780]  Yes, well hey Roger you should come back on the wall room in the next few days. There's so much to talk about a hold on a minute
[1:36:55.300 --> 1:36:57.300]  Your voice counts
[1:36:57.340 --> 1:37:04.500]  When you share information be it over the internet or in person it changes the world the globalists know their agenda is
[1:37:04.500 --> 1:37:08.140]  Unpopular they know you're angry and now to get around big tech
[1:37:08.140 --> 1:37:12.380]  It's more important than ever that we use every tool we've got well

[1:40:54.100 --> 1:41:07.620]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show
[1:41:24.740 --> 1:41:38.780]  Welcome back ladies and gentlemen, I'm Alex Jones your host honored and blessed to be here in our attempt to unify humanity
[1:41:40.340 --> 1:41:46.100]  Well, ladies and gentlemen, you may have never heard of the Tulsa massacre that happened a hundred years ago
[1:41:46.820 --> 1:41:50.940]  And it was a terrible thing that happened and some more things happen around the world constantly
[1:41:50.940 --> 1:41:58.060]  There are massacres every day in Africa where somebody does something wrong and another group gets mad and the fight starts
[1:41:58.060 --> 1:42:00.380]  And then it becomes a chain reaction and hundreds die
[1:42:01.340 --> 1:42:03.740]  But why are you hearing about the Tulsa massacre now?
[1:42:03.740 --> 1:42:08.900]  Why is president the puppet Biden gonna speak on it repeatedly in the next few days?
[1:42:09.300 --> 1:42:17.420]  Well, George Floyd did so well for them dividing the country and causing a summer of rage and two billion dollars of damage with thousands of
[1:42:17.420 --> 1:42:25.020]  Buildings burned down and hundreds of people killed it turns out George Floyd death was questionable probably shouldn't have happened
[1:42:25.900 --> 1:42:29.740]  But Tulsa massacre really did happen and was a travesty
[1:42:30.620 --> 1:42:33.420]  And so now you can have Tulsa memorials everywhere
[1:42:34.700 --> 1:42:37.900]  And teach black folks that the white people are out to get you
[1:42:38.780 --> 1:42:43.580]  And so don't worry about the vaccines. Don't worry about the open borders. Don't worry about world government
[1:42:43.580 --> 1:42:50.460]  Have the new black panther party march in and talk about how killing white people is good because whites are inherently bad
[1:42:52.060 --> 1:42:54.940]  That's what you do when you're a communist Chinese globalist agent
[1:42:54.940 --> 1:43:00.460]  You want to divide the country is you come out and you hype up anything you can find because you know
[1:43:00.460 --> 1:43:05.420]  They say that lynchings and cross burnings are an all-time high because they're at an all-time low and
[1:43:05.420 --> 1:43:12.780]  And 99% of the hate crimes of a swastika painted on the wall or across in a yard turns out are staged
[1:43:14.460 --> 1:43:16.620]  Staged by the left to create division
[1:43:17.180 --> 1:43:20.220]  Remember when all those Jewish centers were getting attacked in New Jersey in New York?
[1:43:20.700 --> 1:43:25.740]  Right where Trump got elected came such an issue you had to do an early state of the union and address and say
[1:43:25.740 --> 1:43:31.020]  I like Jews and I don't want to burn down Jews synagogues and it turned out it was leftist Jews
[1:43:31.500 --> 1:43:33.740]  Burning down their own buildings and they got caught
[1:43:33.740 --> 1:43:38.940]  Three different men and it got shut down where you never even heard of it
[1:43:39.740 --> 1:43:41.740]  knocking over the gravestones
[1:43:41.820 --> 1:43:43.820]  throwing firebombs at the synagogues
[1:43:44.700 --> 1:43:47.420]  And it was leftist Jews to blame Trump
[1:43:48.060 --> 1:43:51.660]  Does that mean Jews are bad? Absolutely not. Does it mean black people are bad because
[1:43:52.300 --> 1:43:57.180]  Thousands of black people not just jesse small it not just bubble Wallace staged events
[1:43:57.660 --> 1:43:59.820]  So they could be victims how I got an article right here
[1:43:59.820 --> 1:44:04.460]  We're a white woman adopted a black girl and basically tortured her for years
[1:44:04.700 --> 1:44:07.580]  Now when she gets sympathy with a black baby to get money
[1:44:08.460 --> 1:44:13.580]  That's a crazy white person doing that these people exist ladies and gentlemen
[1:44:14.700 --> 1:44:16.700]  but out of stack articles
[1:44:17.340 --> 1:44:23.660]  of black folks going up and shooting crowds of other black folks in Chicago in Miami in Dallas
[1:44:24.140 --> 1:44:27.020]  in LA in Portland in
[1:44:27.020 --> 1:44:29.020]  the Bay Area of
[1:44:30.380 --> 1:44:32.380]  San Francisco and Oakland
[1:44:33.020 --> 1:44:35.020]  and it's a blip
[1:44:35.020 --> 1:44:40.380]  when 20-something people get shot and a bunch die because it's black on black and it just happened
[1:44:43.820 --> 1:44:45.820]  But oh my gosh
[1:44:45.820 --> 1:44:51.820]  Doesn't matter if thousands of blacks die here in Chicago shooting each other. We're not gonna have memorials. We're not gonna have plaques
[1:44:51.820 --> 1:44:53.820]  We're not gonna have that for them
[1:44:53.820 --> 1:45:01.500]  We're gonna have it where some white people went crazy and killed some black folks and don't worry
[1:45:01.820 --> 1:45:06.700]  If the new black panther party gets its way and actually starts killing white people in mass
[1:45:06.860 --> 1:45:11.420]  There's a bunch of crazy white people. They're gonna go out and randomly start killing innocent black people
[1:45:11.500 --> 1:45:15.580]  Just the other way around and they're gonna be a whole bunch of dead people black and white
[1:45:18.460 --> 1:45:21.260]  And I don't think you're gonna see the new black panther party
[1:45:21.260 --> 1:45:27.180]  In fact, let's get one of the original founders of black panther party on to break this down as soon as you guys can please this week
[1:45:28.700 --> 1:45:30.700]  He's got his own channel
[1:45:31.260 --> 1:45:32.220]  now
[1:45:32.220 --> 1:45:34.220]  He's been censored off twitter for standing up against
[1:45:34.940 --> 1:45:38.860]  Racism and division at band dot video and what's his name?
[1:45:39.420 --> 1:45:43.820]  Everybody forgets real black panther's names. How you got put in prison trying to promote peace
[1:45:45.580 --> 1:45:47.580]  That's right. What's his name folks?
[1:45:47.580 --> 1:45:52.460]  They're telling me my username. I know his name. I'm sorry. It's rhetorical guys. Larry pink me
[1:45:56.700 --> 1:45:58.220]  And we need to get in fact this weekend
[1:45:58.300 --> 1:46:01.100]  I try to turn the tv off, but I can't help the research and
[1:46:01.980 --> 1:46:05.980]  It was just I mean I've got hours of black people saying kill white people on video
[1:46:06.620 --> 1:46:08.620]  I mean it is the most vile
[1:46:08.780 --> 1:46:13.580]  Beyond kkk stuff because you know, you don't see the kkk out as unsavory as they are saying
[1:46:13.580 --> 1:46:18.380]  Let's kill all the black people and they're all bad kill every one of them and I would say that's really bad thing to do
[1:46:18.620 --> 1:46:24.300]  It's so stupid, but no this is being done ladies and gentlemen on a mass scale
[1:46:25.420 --> 1:46:30.940]  So I've got a fox news clip on this. I've got the threats being made. I've got the new black panther party run by the globalist stomping around
[1:46:30.940 --> 1:46:32.940]  We got all that coming up at the bottom
[1:46:35.340 --> 1:46:39.500]  Of the next hour hell I may even just get to that at 15 after next hour
[1:46:39.500 --> 1:46:43.900]  I just got a lot of clips I want to get together because I got busy today and didn't get all the clips the crew
[1:46:43.900 --> 1:46:46.860]  But I've got a yeah, we'll do it bottom of the hour because I do some preparation on this
[1:46:47.100 --> 1:46:50.140]  I'm going to show you footage of black folks killing white people killing each other
[1:46:51.180 --> 1:46:52.780]  killing Asians
[1:46:52.780 --> 1:46:54.780]  And then you never see that on the news
[1:46:54.780 --> 1:47:00.940]  But then my goodness one crazy white person goes into a black church and kills nine people. It's terrible
[1:47:03.180 --> 1:47:07.180]  And man, it's the end of the world and all whites are guilty
[1:47:07.180 --> 1:47:12.060]  And there's vigils at meetings and everywhere because it fits in to the media narrative
[1:47:12.220 --> 1:47:15.100]  And so all these lives are valuable black white. It doesn't matter
[1:47:15.740 --> 1:47:22.300]  And I know as an audience you get that now let me shift gears into what I need to hit because I only hit part
[1:47:24.140 --> 1:47:29.500]  Of the vaccine news and how the wheels are coming off on that and where all that's going and I need to
[1:47:30.300 --> 1:47:32.300]  get that together
[1:47:32.300 --> 1:47:34.300]  and then I've got
[1:47:34.300 --> 1:47:38.540]  These two folders right here. You see these two folders this affects everybody
[1:47:40.620 --> 1:47:44.700]  And it deals with fertility and eugenics and how we're all being targeted
[1:47:46.540 --> 1:47:48.540]  And what that
[1:47:48.540 --> 1:47:53.180]  Is going to end up looking like very very soon incredible stuff when we start next hour that's in this stack
[1:47:53.500 --> 1:47:55.500]  Let me just give you a little sneak peek
[1:47:56.060 --> 1:48:00.060]  China raises cap on birth to three in major policy shift
[1:48:00.060 --> 1:48:04.700]  First they said you can only have one kid now. They want you to have three. What's behind that? That's a huge deal
[1:48:05.180 --> 1:48:11.820]  It ties into this all these articles how together mercury poisoning makes birds act homosexual. What does that mean? National geographic
[1:48:14.700 --> 1:48:19.340]  Researchers in japan use soybean compound to make catfish hundred percent female
[1:48:21.660 --> 1:48:25.900]  I mean you'll go out to the mall the grocery store anywhere and you'll see a big old strong black man
[1:48:25.900 --> 1:48:30.700]  And a good-looking strong black woman and you'll see three other kids
[1:48:31.980 --> 1:48:33.980]  And they all look like
[1:48:33.980 --> 1:48:38.220]  Affeminate little boys and they're like 18. Do you see a big old white guy a big old?
[1:48:38.300 --> 1:48:39.660]  You know help me black
[1:48:39.660 --> 1:48:44.460]  Lady or hispanic lady or white lady and they all look big and strong and then their kids
[1:48:45.180 --> 1:48:47.180]  look like
[1:48:49.900 --> 1:48:51.900]  Girls

[1:48:58.300 --> 1:49:02.220]  So if you don't want your son's endocrine system
[1:49:03.420 --> 1:49:07.500]  To tell his olfactory nerve that men smell good
[1:49:09.340 --> 1:49:12.620]  They don't look good, but they start smelling good and that's why you get excited
[1:49:13.100 --> 1:49:15.100]  Maybe your son needs to start
[1:49:15.420 --> 1:49:18.140]  Not eating soy big studies on that
[1:49:18.140 --> 1:49:25.740]  It literally makes you attracted to males and the less like hey, this is it's all planned. Hey everybody's gonna be gay now
[1:49:25.900 --> 1:49:28.380]  This isn't about bashing homosexuals

[1:49:35.180 --> 1:49:39.900]  It's about sterilizing us and making it cool when we're all sterile it did some we're all sterile
[1:49:40.060 --> 1:49:44.060]  I'm gonna lay all this out while they're busy trying to tell you about Tulsa, Oklahoma

[1:49:49.980 --> 1:49:51.980]  You're gonna hear a damn word out of the left on that

[1:51:50.140 --> 1:51:55.260]  And so that's why I always take time out to thank you for keeping us on air because without you without the crew
[1:51:55.660 --> 1:52:01.100]  Without our sponsors without our affiliates without everybody we would not be on air and the world would be a different place
[1:52:01.100 --> 1:52:04.860]  So it's not a power trip when I realized the great effect we've had
[1:52:05.340 --> 1:52:11.820]  It's really counting the cost and realizing that if we weren't here if you hadn't have supported us
[1:52:12.540 --> 1:52:15.660]  The whole planet would be in a much worse position with the globalist
[1:52:16.140 --> 1:52:18.460]  Instead a lot of really really positive things are happening
[1:52:18.860 --> 1:52:23.260]  And so many of the corrupt things the globalists have been involved in are now coming out in the open
[1:52:23.500 --> 1:52:26.300]  And so info wars credibility is higher than it's ever been
[1:52:26.620 --> 1:52:29.740]  But the enemy is trying to shut us down with so many different attacks
[1:52:29.740 --> 1:52:32.940]  We've had to build our own infrastructure to stay on air. It's so expensive

[1:53:53.660 --> 1:53:55.660]  I
[1:54:09.260 --> 1:54:12.940]  Let's start out this segment with the george floyd memorial body count
[1:54:12.940 --> 1:54:24.060]  And coming up. We'll get into what's really going on with the promotion of the tulsa race massacre. I'm alex jones. Stay with us
[1:54:25.580 --> 1:54:31.900]  Get behind me. Uh, is the george floyd memorial. This is where george floyd was killed back in may take a look
[1:54:32.860 --> 1:54:38.140]  These mayoral deeds have been set up by uh by protesters and supporters of the movement
[1:54:38.140 --> 1:54:43.020]  Uh, they don't allow anyone in not even the police. It's called an autonomous zone
[1:54:43.500 --> 1:54:45.500]  Uh, and
[1:54:45.500 --> 1:54:47.500]  That
[1:55:06.380 --> 1:55:12.060]  How many lives will be offered at the altar of saint george floyd on june 19th
[1:55:12.060 --> 1:55:18.780]  2020 damien chambers was fatally shot at the george floyd square then on july 5th
[1:55:19.260 --> 1:55:25.260]  2020 lanisha columbus was fatally shot a block away from the george floyd square and the child
[1:55:25.340 --> 1:55:32.620]  She was pregnant with died four weeks later one of lanisha columbus's closest friends and her daughter marveled at the fresh memorial
[1:55:33.180 --> 1:55:36.540]  I don't understand why a person would take her life
[1:55:37.580 --> 1:55:40.540]  I don't I don't then on march 6th
[1:55:40.540 --> 1:55:47.260]  2021 emas right was shot outside the cup food store and died at a nearby hospital
[1:55:47.340 --> 1:55:52.540]  He was a navigator helping people find a better path focusing on youth in and around 38th and chicago
[1:55:53.020 --> 1:55:59.660]  Friends and family believe it was that effort that cost him his life and as the george floyd debacle reached its anniversary
[1:55:59.660 --> 1:56:10.620]  Shots continued to ring out
[1:56:22.060 --> 1:56:28.220]  All at the intersection of east 38th street and chicago avenue in minneapolis, minnesota
[1:56:28.220 --> 1:56:32.460]  In the wake of the local unrest in the minneapolis saint paul area
[1:56:32.700 --> 1:56:41.740]  Following george floyd's death the second most destructive property damage took place in us history only after the 1992
[1:56:41.900 --> 1:56:49.180]  Los angeles riots the devastation would tally up at least two billion dollars in insurance claims spreading across
[1:56:49.900 --> 1:56:55.420]  140 us cities it's also true that there are times where that square is
[1:56:55.420 --> 1:57:01.660]  Fight it's creating a haven though unintentionally for a criminal activity and behavior
[1:57:02.220 --> 1:57:03.980]  when I open my door
[1:57:03.980 --> 1:57:06.780]  I look across the street and
[1:57:07.580 --> 1:57:13.660]  george floyd square is directly across the street depending on who's on the barriers
[1:57:14.780 --> 1:57:22.140]  Sometimes it's easy to get in and sometimes it's not these rules that are hanging near the area that the protesters have occupied
[1:57:22.140 --> 1:57:27.980]  Has been circulating around the internet for several days now it defines this zone as a sacred place for the community
[1:57:28.060 --> 1:57:32.300]  It asks people to enter with humility and reverence and that's all fine and good of course
[1:57:32.380 --> 1:57:36.140]  But if you continue reading the rules a little bit farther, you'll find
[1:57:36.940 --> 1:57:40.140]  Some rules that are specifically for white people only for example
[1:57:40.140 --> 1:57:46.300]  They require people with a lighter skin tone to quote seek to contribute to the energy of the space rather than than to drain it
[1:57:46.300 --> 1:57:52.540]  They also say that white people should de-center themselves the innocent and unacknowledged
[1:57:52.860 --> 1:57:58.540]  Became collateral damage as the marxist black lives matter mob and antifa
[1:57:59.020 --> 1:58:05.900]  Looted destroyed and murdered those they chaotically deemed deserving of their rage. I was a tv's cut
[1:58:06.380 --> 1:58:07.900]  Come on cut
[1:58:07.900 --> 1:58:09.900]  Come on man. We better than this cut
[1:58:10.460 --> 1:58:12.460]  over a tv cut
[1:58:12.460 --> 1:58:19.420]  Would george floyd agree that his life is more important than that of 53 year old federal law enforcement officer
[1:58:19.500 --> 1:58:23.340]  patrick underwood or 53 year old louisville barbacue man
[1:58:23.580 --> 1:58:32.380]  james macatee or 22 year old iowan italia marie kelly or the others people who have died as a result of the swirling inertia of the
[1:58:32.460 --> 1:58:36.220]  chaotic protests or the brutal beatings of innocent people
[1:58:36.220 --> 1:58:43.580]  Desperately trying to protect their businesses the destruction of which destroys the lives of innocent people
[1:58:43.740 --> 1:58:48.300]  Connected to those businesses either by employment community or family
[1:58:51.980 --> 1:58:55.020]  i've got some really good news for the viewers and listeners this broadcast
[1:58:55.980 --> 1:58:58.780]  And then i've got some really really really really really good news
[1:58:58.780 --> 1:59:05.660]  Yes, i could spend an hour telling you about how the globals are getting exposed and how they launched covid 19 as a bio weapon and how much
[1:59:05.900 --> 1:59:10.860]  Trouble bill gates and fouts you're in i can even tell you about how the states are turning against the puppet president
[1:59:10.860 --> 1:59:14.300]  Byte and saying we're gonna have thousand dollar fines to try to make people wear masks
[1:59:14.460 --> 1:59:21.180]  I could tell you about all of that, but why shouldn't i instead tell you about the super good news concerning the info war
[1:59:21.260 --> 1:59:27.500]  That's right, ladies and gentlemen. We are running right now the memorial day special for the next week only
[1:59:27.500 --> 1:59:29.500]  With store-wide free shipping

[1:59:46.940 --> 1:59:50.540]  And it comes in four and it's incredible products and sword sorrows hates it
[1:59:50.540 --> 1:59:52.540]  Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha
[1:59:55.020 --> 2:00:01.340]  Live from austin texas broadcasting world wide it's alex johns
[2:00:01.340 --> 2:00:21.020]  Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the third hour of the broadcast.
[2:00:21.020 --> 2:00:22.820]  It's Tuesday, June 1st.
[2:00:22.820 --> 2:00:24.820]  The year is 2021.
[2:00:24.820 --> 2:00:26.820]  All right.
[2:00:26.820 --> 2:00:31.260]  Let me get into this right now because Joe Biden wants to distract from the human smuggling
[2:00:31.260 --> 2:00:32.260]  the open borders.
[2:00:32.260 --> 2:00:36.780]  He wants to distract from hundreds of thousands getting sick and dying from the poison vaccines.
[2:00:36.780 --> 2:00:40.780]  He wants to distract from being a communist Chinese agent and the three million Muslims,
[2:00:40.780 --> 2:00:45.100]  Christians, and Buddhists in death camps and all the current things that are happening.
[2:00:45.100 --> 2:00:48.780]  He wants to distract from the blue cities collapsing and hundreds of thousands dying
[2:00:48.780 --> 2:00:52.300]  from fentanyl and other drug overdoses.
[2:00:52.300 --> 2:00:59.580]  He wants to distract from 4,000, I have the fed zone numbers right here, 4,000 people
[2:00:59.580 --> 2:01:05.820]  shot a year in Chicago, 95% of them black, 90% of that black on black.
[2:01:05.820 --> 2:01:11.940]  They want to distract from all of that and continue to divide and conquer this country.
[2:01:11.940 --> 2:01:17.060]  America is only 4% of the world population, 96% without side the country.
[2:01:17.060 --> 2:01:22.100]  But you tune into our media, you would think there's a race war in this country.
[2:01:22.100 --> 2:01:25.380]  You would think black people and white people hate each other.
[2:01:25.380 --> 2:01:27.500]  We've seen crime going down since the early 90s.
[2:01:27.500 --> 2:01:31.660]  Now it started to go back up the last few years and if you look at the crime statistics
[2:01:31.660 --> 2:01:35.260]  that they try to suppress in the media, it's 10 to 1 black on white.
[2:01:35.260 --> 2:01:40.060]  Still, it doesn't mean black people are out on purpose in large statistics trying to kill
[2:01:40.060 --> 2:01:41.060]  white people.
[2:01:41.060 --> 2:01:47.140]  But when it comes to people hunting down people because of what color they are, ladies and
[2:01:47.140 --> 2:01:54.340]  gentlemen, it is overwhelmingly black on white, black on Asian because the media and all these
[2:01:54.340 --> 2:01:59.980]  different websites like World Star Hip Hop and the rest of it promote that that's what
[2:01:59.980 --> 2:02:00.980]  needs to happen.
[2:02:00.980 --> 2:02:04.500]  And the new black Panther Party has been in the Houston Chronicle.
[2:02:04.500 --> 2:02:10.020]  I've had them on and debated these guys saying, don't go out and mug, don't go out and loot
[2:02:10.020 --> 2:02:15.100]  in the black neighborhood, go and do it to the whites and the Asians, they deserve it.
[2:02:15.100 --> 2:02:19.460]  Now it doesn't really happen in the Hispanic neighborhoods because the Hispanics stick together
[2:02:19.460 --> 2:02:21.460]  and shoot back.
[2:02:21.460 --> 2:02:26.860]  But it's a terrible thing and the black people in these neighborhoods are being fed on by
[2:02:26.860 --> 2:02:29.220]  these thugs as well.
[2:02:29.220 --> 2:02:32.660]  So it's getting very, very scary and the media then covers it up.
[2:02:32.660 --> 2:02:33.660]  They don't prosecute.
[2:02:33.660 --> 2:02:38.660]  I have a stack of articles here where black people kill white people in cold blood and
[2:02:38.660 --> 2:02:42.020]  the grand jury's no-bill saying, well, they're black, we're not, we're going to let them
[2:02:42.020 --> 2:02:43.020]  kill whites.
[2:02:43.020 --> 2:02:48.300]  Kind of like the illegal aliens are allowed to kill whites or blacks, like in San Francisco,
[2:02:48.300 --> 2:02:53.500]  you've seen the cases where the jury, the grand jury says, no, you know, you're allowed
[2:02:53.500 --> 2:02:58.620]  to shoot a white lady in the back twice, she deserves it because she's white.
[2:02:58.620 --> 2:03:03.100]  And you see the New York Times saying whites are inherently bad, deserve to die.
[2:03:03.100 --> 2:03:08.660]  So it's the corporate media and the big tech companies that literally are totally evil
[2:03:08.660 --> 2:03:12.340]  that are distracting and diverting us to kill each other.
[2:03:12.340 --> 2:03:16.980]  I can show you hours of footage of a white lady walking in St. Louis by the lake and
[2:03:16.980 --> 2:03:18.460]  black folks just shoot it for fun.
[2:03:18.460 --> 2:03:23.220]  I can show you hundreds of videos just this year.
[2:03:23.220 --> 2:03:28.780]  But the reason I say that is there's a bigger picture here.
[2:03:28.780 --> 2:03:33.100]  The globalist already had a lockdown to try to bankrupt the economy.
[2:03:33.100 --> 2:03:37.420]  They already tried to have a bunch of riots with a 10 plus billion dollars of big corporate
[2:03:37.420 --> 2:03:41.100]  funding to Black Lives Matter and others last summer, but it wasn't enough.
[2:03:41.100 --> 2:03:44.740]  And they know there's going to be some questionable events and some cops are going to do some
[2:03:44.740 --> 2:03:45.740]  wrong things.
[2:03:45.740 --> 2:03:47.100]  People are people.
[2:03:47.100 --> 2:03:51.860]  And they planned this summer to really destabilize this country so Biden can bring in not just
[2:03:51.860 --> 2:03:55.220]  martial law in D.C., but martial law nationwide.
[2:03:55.220 --> 2:03:59.340]  And they're trying to exacerbate racial divisions with stuff like this.
[2:03:59.340 --> 2:04:04.460]  Biden administration sought to use race to determine federal benefits, courts now have
[2:04:04.460 --> 2:04:05.460]  stepped in.
[2:04:05.460 --> 2:04:11.620]  But Biden says he'll sign executive orders and ignore what the courts say.
[2:04:11.620 --> 2:04:13.300]  So this is really evil.
[2:04:13.300 --> 2:04:16.300]  So you've got a white-owned business.
[2:04:16.300 --> 2:04:17.580]  We ordered shutdown for a year.
[2:04:17.580 --> 2:04:18.580]  You don't get any money.
[2:04:18.580 --> 2:04:20.300]  But if you're black, you do.
[2:04:20.300 --> 2:04:26.300]  You don't replace one wrong 60, 70, 100 years ago with another wrong.
[2:04:26.300 --> 2:04:27.740]  This is just insane.
[2:04:27.740 --> 2:04:29.580]  And again, the globalists know what they're doing.
[2:04:29.580 --> 2:04:30.900]  It's in the WikiLeaks.
[2:04:30.900 --> 2:04:33.100]  This top professor is talking to Hillary.
[2:04:33.100 --> 2:04:36.860]  And they say once you get in, you've got to accelerate culture war.
[2:04:36.860 --> 2:04:41.260]  Men against women, women against men, black against white, white against black.
[2:04:41.260 --> 2:04:42.780]  That's what all this is.
[2:04:42.780 --> 2:04:46.260]  So there's a lot of real white racists, real black racists killing each other.
[2:04:46.260 --> 2:04:49.980]  And the more that happens, the more there's reasons for people to get tribal because it's
[2:04:49.980 --> 2:04:51.220]  like a gang.
[2:04:51.220 --> 2:04:54.940]  You don't want to be in the crypts of the bloods, but you wear a red hat, you get shot.
[2:04:54.940 --> 2:04:58.100]  You don't want to be in a race war, but you're white, so you get mugged.
[2:04:58.100 --> 2:04:59.380]  Now you become a racist.
[2:04:59.380 --> 2:05:02.180]  Now you go out and target a random black person.
[2:05:02.180 --> 2:05:04.700]  That's called a race war.
[2:05:04.700 --> 2:05:10.100]  And so they go back into our history, a witness is saying that a black man that worked in
[2:05:10.100 --> 2:05:17.620]  a building, uh, one of the first high rises through this white lady down a elevator shaft
[2:05:17.620 --> 2:05:22.740]  in a fight, he gets arrested, folks said there's going to be a lynching, a hundred black guys
[2:05:22.740 --> 2:05:25.780]  show up with their guns.
[2:05:25.780 --> 2:05:28.380]  Somebody shoots 10 white people died, two black people died.
[2:05:28.380 --> 2:05:30.660]  Now the white people go, we're not going to let that happen.
[2:05:30.660 --> 2:05:36.060]  They go get their guns and a giant war starts for two days on Memorial Day weekend.
[2:05:36.060 --> 2:05:38.980]  You know, liquor was involved on both sides.
[2:05:38.980 --> 2:05:40.540]  That's a historical thing that went on.
[2:05:40.540 --> 2:05:47.300]  Biden's dredging it up, shitting in feds to dig up graves and create all sorts of hysteria
[2:05:47.300 --> 2:05:53.540]  to distract from what's currently happening, the burying of America.
[2:05:53.540 --> 2:05:54.540]  That's all there knows.
[2:05:54.540 --> 2:05:57.700]  Talk about 50 plus percent of blacks being aborted before they're born.
[2:05:57.700 --> 2:06:00.700]  There's no talk about drugs being shipped by the CIA and your neighborhood.
[2:06:00.700 --> 2:06:01.700]  Oh, no, no, no.
[2:06:01.700 --> 2:06:05.020]  It's all how white people in Tulsa, almost everybody's dead.
[2:06:05.020 --> 2:06:06.420]  This is a hundred years ago.
[2:06:06.420 --> 2:06:07.420]  This happened a hundred years ago.
[2:06:07.420 --> 2:06:13.700]  I don't know how folks that are 105 or 102 say they remember it, but okay.
[2:06:13.700 --> 2:06:16.780]  And now open the wounds up again.
[2:06:16.780 --> 2:06:20.220]  So they got all this traction for race war with George Floyd.
[2:06:20.220 --> 2:06:21.220]  Imagine what they're going to get now.
[2:06:21.220 --> 2:06:26.100]  Well, here's the new black Panther Party, not the real black Panther Party.
[2:06:26.100 --> 2:06:28.540]  This is the new black Panther Party.
[2:06:28.540 --> 2:06:31.060]  And there's hours of this at info wars.com.
[2:06:31.060 --> 2:06:34.260]  What they were saying to a crowd buying into it.
[2:06:34.260 --> 2:06:35.260]  Listen to this nonsense.
[2:06:35.260 --> 2:06:38.980]  We go with them.
[2:06:38.980 --> 2:06:42.860]  Because that time of coming around.
[2:06:42.860 --> 2:06:43.860]  Check.
[2:06:43.860 --> 2:06:44.860]  We're chilling.
[2:06:44.860 --> 2:06:45.860]  They ain't right.
[2:06:45.860 --> 2:06:46.860]  What you're done to us all.
[2:06:46.860 --> 2:06:47.860]  You've done with the six thousand years of chilling.
[2:06:47.860 --> 2:06:50.860]  Six hundred million of us and four hundred and eighty years in particular in 150 million
[2:06:50.860 --> 2:06:51.860]  in the past.
[2:06:51.860 --> 2:07:09.020]  They're tying the day up because it's the time and it's the state of the race of
[2:07:09.020 --> 2:07:24.580]  the country.
[2:07:24.580 --> 2:07:28.740]  Why does everybody want to get into countries founded by whites that are Christian?
[2:07:28.740 --> 2:07:30.780]  Because there are basic rights or basic freedoms.
[2:07:30.780 --> 2:07:32.580]  Things aren't perfect, but it's better than other countries.
[2:07:32.580 --> 2:07:35.940]  You know, it was black soul, blacks in the slavery, white soul, whites in slavery.
[2:07:35.940 --> 2:07:41.700]  Nobody knows that he's going back six thousand years, white people are the bad guys.
[2:07:41.700 --> 2:07:43.820]  So this goes on and on.
[2:07:43.820 --> 2:07:47.260]  Hundreds of black people with guns sent the fights about the start.
[2:07:47.260 --> 2:07:51.540]  Well, just like it did a hundred years ago, when a hundred blacks showed up at the jail,
[2:07:51.540 --> 2:07:53.220]  no one was being lynched.
[2:07:53.220 --> 2:07:54.220]  Shots came out.
[2:07:54.220 --> 2:07:55.220]  Ten whites got killed.
[2:07:55.220 --> 2:07:56.220]  Two blacks got killed.
[2:07:56.220 --> 2:07:58.020]  And he had a little mini race war.
[2:07:58.020 --> 2:08:02.940]  So the globalists are looking for this to repeat on a national scale what happened in Tulsa
[2:08:02.940 --> 2:08:07.660]  or looking to repeat what happened in L.A. in 1992.
[2:08:07.660 --> 2:08:13.100]  And that's why Biden's going there going, boy, if we use one black guy dying questionably,
[2:08:13.100 --> 2:08:17.940]  imagine what we can do now to divert from the takeover of the country.
[2:08:17.940 --> 2:08:21.940]  And as Biden said, China's going to win its war against America by 2030.
[2:08:21.940 --> 2:08:25.980]  It's when they want to win 2030, 2035.
[2:08:25.980 --> 2:08:30.620]  And so you see the actual enemies playing us off against each other.
[2:08:30.620 --> 2:08:31.620]  And it really is disgusting.
[2:08:31.620 --> 2:08:36.620]  We're going to come back and go to a little Fox News clip where, again, no one's even
[2:08:36.620 --> 2:08:38.860]  pointing out this is old wounds being opened.
[2:08:38.860 --> 2:08:42.060]  No one's pointing out this is an opportunistic.
[2:08:42.060 --> 2:08:44.860]  And now they're saying, oh, there have been other cases of this.
[2:08:44.860 --> 2:08:47.260]  Yeah, there's other cases of one town killing another town.
[2:08:47.260 --> 2:08:51.460]  And there's other cases of one black town killing another black town.
[2:08:51.460 --> 2:08:54.580]  There's cases of Native Americans killing each other and whites killing Native Americans.
[2:08:54.580 --> 2:08:56.180]  Native Americans killing whites.
[2:08:56.180 --> 2:08:57.180]  That's what people do.
[2:08:57.180 --> 2:08:59.300]  That's what goes on all over the world.
[2:08:59.300 --> 2:09:03.220]  But you don't hear them talking about, oh, a million blacks killed by other blacks at
[2:09:03.220 --> 2:09:05.660]  the behest of the UN and the Clintons in Rwanda.
[2:09:05.660 --> 2:09:09.020]  Christians killed by the other tribe at the UN directive.
[2:09:09.020 --> 2:09:13.820]  No, you don't hear about millions killed in the year of spring funded by Obama and the
[2:09:13.820 --> 2:09:14.820]  globalists.
[2:09:14.820 --> 2:09:18.740]  No, because these are cold-blooded killers, but they can try to, with all the Hollywood
[2:09:18.740 --> 2:09:22.940]  movies and all the TV shows, talking about whites killing blacks and creating all these
[2:09:22.940 --> 2:09:27.580]  fake narratives and then threading up old narratives and magnifying them to bring the
[2:09:27.580 --> 2:09:28.580]  country down.
[2:09:28.580 --> 2:09:30.300]  This is just how you kill the country.
[2:09:30.300 --> 2:09:32.580]  It's how the dollar's no longer the World Reserve currency.
[2:09:32.580 --> 2:09:34.420]  It's how your pension funds aren't worth anything.
[2:09:34.420 --> 2:09:36.060]  It's how you don't have a job anymore.
[2:09:36.060 --> 2:09:40.300]  And now you've got universal guaranteed income to live in a little 200-square-foot prison
[2:09:40.300 --> 2:09:45.660]  cell, coffin apartment, and you get your universal income, but forced inoculations come with
[2:09:45.660 --> 2:09:46.660]  it.
[2:09:46.660 --> 2:09:48.660]  This is America going into slavery.
[2:09:48.660 --> 2:09:51.820]  They want to start a race war this summer.
[2:09:51.820 --> 2:09:55.060]  Gerald in South Carolina, go ahead, you're on the air, trying to move quicker.
[2:09:55.060 --> 2:09:56.060]  Hey, Alex.
[2:09:56.060 --> 2:09:57.060]  Welcome.
[2:09:57.060 --> 2:10:01.540]  Well, first off, thanks for being the voice of reason and amongst all this stupidity.
[2:10:01.540 --> 2:10:04.660]  Wanted to warn people, I've been trying to get ahold of you for a year, okay?
[2:10:04.660 --> 2:10:11.380]  I'm a double amputee and I have bacteria infection on my lung that'll never go away.
[2:10:11.380 --> 2:10:12.860]  Living defense saved my life.
[2:10:12.860 --> 2:10:17.220]  They had me on antibiotics for two years that almost killed me.
[2:10:17.220 --> 2:10:18.660]  Living defense brought me back.
[2:10:18.660 --> 2:10:24.380]  I wanted to just quote from the Bible, Jesus is saying as to where we are right now.
[2:10:24.380 --> 2:10:31.180]  This is Matthew 24, verse nine, then they shall deliver you up to be afflicted and shall
[2:10:31.180 --> 2:10:36.100]  kill you, and ye shall be hated of all nations for my name's sake.
[2:10:36.100 --> 2:10:41.460]  And then shall many be offended and shall betray one another and shall hate one another.
[2:10:41.460 --> 2:10:43.220]  That's right where we're at, brother.
[2:10:43.220 --> 2:10:47.660]  And that's because God's name is on the founding of this country, no matter what they say,
[2:10:47.660 --> 2:10:51.980]  and that's why the enemy hates it, because God created this country.
[2:10:51.980 --> 2:10:56.740]  I share with you the viewers and listeners the facts of where Info Wars is, and it's
[2:10:56.740 --> 2:11:01.260]  always a complex picture, but I do my best to explain it to you because you are the patrons
[2:11:01.260 --> 2:11:03.300]  that make all this possible.
[2:11:03.300 --> 2:11:08.580]  So in short, the world's awakening, the spiral of censorship, Info Wars has never been more
[2:11:08.580 --> 2:11:13.540]  influential and has never had a bigger effect exposing the global agenda and fighting it.
[2:11:13.540 --> 2:11:19.100]  But that said, the COVID lockdowns, the shutdown of supply chains has almost shut us down because
[2:11:19.100 --> 2:11:23.140]  most of the best-selling products which you want to buy, like DNA Force Plus and others,
[2:11:23.140 --> 2:11:25.060]  have been sold out for up to seven months.
[2:11:25.060 --> 2:11:26.060]  Well guess what?
[2:11:26.060 --> 2:11:29.660]  DNA Force Plus just came back in, thank God, for seven months.
[2:11:29.660 --> 2:11:34.540]  It's 40% off, it's amazing, at InfoWarsTour.com, and for the week leading up through Memorial
[2:11:34.540 --> 2:11:39.380]  Day, we have store-wide free shipping and double-patria points, and alpha powers back
[2:11:39.380 --> 2:11:44.100]  in stock, and supermilitalies back in stock, and pollen block, and vasovistor all back in
[2:11:44.100 --> 2:11:49.580]  stock, as much as 50% off, store-wide free shipping, double-patria points, InfoWarsTour.com.
[2:11:49.580 --> 2:12:18.580]  Thanks for keeping us on the air, InfoWars.
[2:12:19.580 --> 2:12:30.180]  So there's a lot of ignorance out there, there's a lot of people that drive under the speed
[2:12:30.180 --> 2:12:34.740]  limit, the fast lane, there's a lot of folks that let their kids play out in traffic, a
[2:12:34.740 --> 2:12:41.420]  lot of people that are scared of their own shadows and superstitious, and there are a
[2:12:41.420 --> 2:12:47.540]  lot of people who don't understand why America, really England, was the first place to get
[2:12:47.540 --> 2:12:53.260]  rid of tribalism, and a belief that we could unify people around Jesus Christ, but now
[2:12:53.260 --> 2:12:57.060]  the globalists don't want that, they want to unify people under the New World Order,
[2:12:57.060 --> 2:13:01.500]  and they want to racially divide everybody, and create such a division that no one can
[2:13:01.500 --> 2:13:07.980]  ever get together, and oppose their dominance, and their control, in fact, even Michael Moore
[2:13:07.980 --> 2:13:13.260]  in his last film interviewed a famous leptist about that, but when you hear them mention
[2:13:13.260 --> 2:13:18.020]  the tactics they use, realize that they're telling you about the tactics acting like
[2:13:18.020 --> 2:13:23.180]  conservatives or Christians are doing it when they're the ones clearly doing it, and again,
[2:13:23.180 --> 2:13:30.060]  it's so transparent that Biden hides behind protecting black people, and he's the one
[2:13:30.060 --> 2:13:34.740]  with Robert Byrd, the KKK leader, and Hillary, that passed the law to give black people
[2:13:34.740 --> 2:13:39.300]  sentences three times longer than white people, which is a terrible idea if you take a bunch
[2:13:39.300 --> 2:13:44.660]  of young black males, put them in prison for nonviolent crimes, they come out with a degree
[2:13:44.660 --> 2:13:51.300]  in crime, but that was the plan, very, very sick, here's a little bit of Fox News gushing
[2:13:51.300 --> 2:13:56.660]  over Biden, how great him opening these old wounds are, who is going to call this out,
[2:13:56.660 --> 2:13:59.700]  how obvious this is, here it is.
[2:13:59.700 --> 2:14:20.060]  John, good to see you, this is the first president, by the way, to travel here to Tulsa to commemorate
[2:14:20.060 --> 2:14:25.540]  the dark days, and to pay homage to so many who lost their lives, their property, and
[2:14:25.540 --> 2:14:31.180]  their livelihood 100 years ago, you know, right now there are only a handful of survivors
[2:14:31.180 --> 2:14:37.140]  remaining of the actual attack, and before speaking today, President Biden will be meeting
[2:14:37.140 --> 2:14:41.460]  with them, and he is also going to tour at least one of the cultural centers here in
[2:14:41.460 --> 2:14:47.700]  the Greenwood district of Tulsa, formerly known as the Black Wall Street, until 1921,
[2:14:47.700 --> 2:14:52.420]  when an angry white mob burned almost everything to the ground.
[2:14:52.420 --> 2:14:59.180]  At least 300 people died, exact numbers, this many years later, still not known.
[2:14:59.180 --> 2:15:07.860]  I still see black men seeing, being shot, black bodies lying in the street, I still smell
[2:15:07.860 --> 2:15:12.540]  smoke and see fire.
[2:15:12.540 --> 2:15:17.580]  Very, very painful memories, as you can imagine, for a lot of people in this community, to
[2:15:17.580 --> 2:15:22.420]  say a speech, by the way, will be hitting on a number of things, including President
[2:15:22.420 --> 2:15:29.300]  Biden's announcement of some specific measures to address racial inequality in this country,
[2:15:29.300 --> 2:15:36.180]  one example being a new plan to help narrow the wealth gap between white Americans and
[2:15:36.180 --> 2:15:37.180]  black Americans.
[2:15:37.180 --> 2:15:38.180]  John.
[2:15:38.180 --> 2:15:43.140]  The president is going to be meeting with three people who survived that massacre from
[2:15:43.140 --> 2:15:46.100]  101 to 107 years old.
[2:15:46.100 --> 2:15:51.340]  I bless them that they're still around, Casey Stagall for us, they had to have been very
[2:15:51.340 --> 2:15:52.340]  young back then.
[2:15:52.340 --> 2:15:53.340]  Good to see you to my friend.
[2:15:53.340 --> 2:15:54.340]  Thanks.
[2:15:54.340 --> 2:15:59.780]  This is so incredibly exploitative, so incredibly exploitative.
[2:15:59.780 --> 2:16:05.300]  You know the top nine wealthiest groups per capita in this country are Asian, because
[2:16:05.300 --> 2:16:09.020]  they work hard, they go get their grades, they start businesses, they reinvest almost
[2:16:09.020 --> 2:16:10.020]  all the money.
[2:16:10.020 --> 2:16:16.900]  And the idea that black versus white and the income disparity, separation that's almost
[2:16:16.900 --> 2:16:23.140]  gone away on average, I mean, this is pure racism, pure division, whites are evil, it
[2:16:23.140 --> 2:16:26.780]  will make whites go be in their own racial group, whites that weren't racist are becoming
[2:16:26.780 --> 2:16:31.060]  that out of sheer protection, and then it's going to make all the, quote, brown groups
[2:16:31.060 --> 2:16:35.700]  of the majority worldwide coming in to get their free stuff, hate white people, with
[2:16:35.700 --> 2:16:42.660]  a bunch of multinational corporations manipulating and controlling the whole damn thing.
[2:16:42.660 --> 2:16:46.540]  You're not going to sit here and show you hours of black folks shooting white people,
[2:16:46.540 --> 2:16:48.780]  but I don't even really get to that because I don't want to create the division and we're
[2:16:48.780 --> 2:16:54.980]  not hiding it, we show some of it, but again, it's all being done in the media hyping only
[2:16:54.980 --> 2:16:59.580]  certain events, just like saying whites are attacking Asians at record numbers, that's
[2:16:59.580 --> 2:17:00.660]  not even true.
[2:17:00.660 --> 2:17:04.620]  They use black attacks on Asians to say whites are doing it, they have marches in Chicago
[2:17:04.620 --> 2:17:11.460]  and New York against white supremacism, and now the new Amazon headquarters in New York
[2:17:11.460 --> 2:17:16.140]  are finding all these nooses, I mean, this is ridiculous, this is Psyop, it's how you
[2:17:16.140 --> 2:17:20.100]  sink the ship, it's how you bring the country down, here's some of the numbers, this is
[2:17:20.100 --> 2:17:26.380]  ABC News out of Chicago, Chicago shootings, 32 shot for fatally in Memorial Day weekend
[2:17:26.380 --> 2:17:36.780]  violence across the city, 4,000 on average shot a year, almost all black on black, 1,298
[2:17:36.780 --> 2:17:44.180]  so far this year, that's 291 more than last year, it's growing, there's the statistics
[2:17:44.180 --> 2:17:50.500]  on that, let's continue here, the whole Tulsa massacre, notice the news doesn't tell you,
[2:17:50.500 --> 2:17:53.740]  and I'm not defending what happened there, it's stupid, it's a tragedy, but it's how
[2:17:53.740 --> 2:17:58.500]  a real race war starts, they report that a black man gets into some altercation where
[2:17:58.500 --> 2:18:03.220]  he worked in a building with a 17-year-old white woman, she gets thrown down the elevator
[2:18:03.220 --> 2:18:07.900]  shaft, the guy is taken to jail, there's a rumor there's going to be a lynching or
[2:18:07.900 --> 2:18:14.660]  he has been lynched, 100 armed black men show up, white folks show up, 10 whites get shot,
[2:18:14.660 --> 2:18:19.580]  two blacks get shot, and then the whole race war starts for two days, and a bunch of people
[2:18:19.580 --> 2:18:23.660]  get killed, and you notice the news just says, oh just for no reason, the white people just
[2:18:23.660 --> 2:18:27.820]  burned down the whole city and killed the black people, again just say how it started,
[2:18:27.820 --> 2:18:34.860]  say what went on, say it was stupid, and people drunk on a weekend, no, they don't tell you
[2:18:34.860 --> 2:18:41.020]  that, because they want to repeat it but on a wider scale, and again, and I always see
[2:18:41.020 --> 2:18:44.620]  the racist blacks go, oh that Jones is scared, we're going to come get him, yeah I'm real
[2:18:44.620 --> 2:18:48.620]  scared man, they're putting cancer viruses in everybody, they've got chemtrails, they've
[2:18:48.620 --> 2:18:53.300]  got 5G killing everybody, world governments here, China's got 3 million people in death
[2:18:53.300 --> 2:18:58.540]  camps, run by big tech, yeah I'm scared of, for everybody, I'm not sitting here stupidly
[2:18:58.540 --> 2:19:03.260]  scared of black people, and how are you going to come get me, and I've got my second amendment
[2:19:03.260 --> 2:19:07.100]  because I'm scared and all this crap, look at this BLM co-founder, Marxist works for
[2:19:07.100 --> 2:19:11.700]  George Soros, called for an end to Israel, whether you like Israel or not, the left
[2:19:11.700 --> 2:19:16.340]  calls me a Nazi for believing America should exist, this woman hates Jews, says Israel
[2:19:16.340 --> 2:19:22.460]  shouldn't exist, but she's wonderful, New York black men sucker punches Asian woman,
[2:19:22.460 --> 2:19:27.300]  this is just today, Chinatown knocks her out cold, yeah let's show the footage of the white
[2:19:27.300 --> 2:19:34.620]  supremacist, can we show all the white supremacists attacking Asians, that's what the news says,
[2:19:34.620 --> 2:19:39.540]  and it goes on and on and on, and we got leftist attacking Trump supporters, we got pizza delivery
[2:19:39.540 --> 2:19:46.140]  man ambushed by teams in lawless Paris neighborhood, again because he's white, South Carolina jury
[2:19:46.140 --> 2:19:50.460]  find black man who confessed to killing white man for no reason, not guilty of murder, spends
[2:19:50.460 --> 2:19:57.300]  less than two hours liberating, just randomly shot him, it goes on and on and on, and then
[2:19:57.300 --> 2:20:02.460]  you got all the other weirdness that's happening, but what's really happening I'll describe
[2:20:02.460 --> 2:20:09.100]  when we come back, because there's articles that parallel this that are keystones to it,
[2:20:09.100 --> 2:20:14.420]  look at this, white mom charged with medical child abuse for subjecting black daughter
[2:20:14.420 --> 2:20:17.900]  to unnecessary treatment, you go what does that mean, how does that tie in, I'll tell
[2:20:17.900 --> 2:20:22.460]  you how my brain works, when we come back, because this explains it all, then the answer
[2:20:22.460 --> 2:20:27.980]  is right here in this article, secretary for Kenya's atheist society announces he's found
[2:20:27.980 --> 2:20:33.460]  Jesus Christ resigns, we're going to talk about it all, we need to resign from being manipulated
[2:20:33.460 --> 2:20:37.860]  by the globalist, we need to resign from Satan, we need to sign up with Jesus, that's the
[2:20:37.860 --> 2:20:45.460]  answer, infowars.com, newswars.com, tomorrow's news today, but the first president to visit
[2:20:45.460 --> 2:20:52.860]  the hundred years, yeah, to try to cause a damn race war in Tulsa, I'm giving you a status

[2:21:05.020 --> 2:21:09.460]  coming out, and yes, I'm risking my life and yes, it's very dangerous, but it's worth it,
[2:21:09.460 --> 2:21:13.180]  I'm very honored to be in the fight, so thanks for keeping me in the fight, and our great

[2:21:51.180 --> 2:21:55.700]  A lot of virtue signalers out there will tell you how much they care about troops and how
[2:21:55.700 --> 2:21:59.500]  much they care about veterans, but at the same time, they won't stand up for what those
[2:21:59.500 --> 2:22:05.180]  veterans and what those troops fought for in the last 250 years of US history, and now
[2:22:05.180 --> 2:22:10.180]  more than ever what our republic stands for and stood for is under attack, America is
[2:22:10.180 --> 2:22:16.100]  under globalist takeover, it's an information war, it is an economic war, but most importantly,
[2:22:16.100 --> 2:22:22.260]  it is a spiritual war, and now of course, it's a biological and chemical war with the
[2:22:22.260 --> 2:22:26.460]  vaccines, we were the first to tell you that the virus came out of Wuhan, we were the first
[2:22:26.460 --> 2:22:31.420]  to tell you the vaccine passports were coming, we were the first to lay out basically everything
[2:22:31.420 --> 2:22:34.700]  because we actually do our research, know what we're talking about, and that's why it's
[2:22:34.700 --> 2:22:38.740]  important to keep infowars in the air now more than ever, and for Memorial Day week,
[2:22:38.740 --> 2:22:42.260]  we're having store wide free shipping and double patriot points, a lot of great products
[2:22:42.260 --> 2:22:47.140]  are back in stock by DNA Force, Alpha Power, Impala Block, so to all the veterans and all
[2:22:47.140 --> 2:22:50.220]  the patriots we salute you, and I want to ask the listeners, please support infowars
[2:22:50.220 --> 2:22:51.220]  now more than ever.
[2:22:51.220 --> 2:22:54.060]  When I get up here and tell you that most of our best selling products have been sold
[2:22:54.060 --> 2:22:58.060]  out for three months, four months, six months, seven months, it's not a gimmick to make
[2:22:58.060 --> 2:23:02.700]  you buy the products, I'm really genuinely freaked out because listeners were buying
[2:23:02.700 --> 2:23:06.700]  enough of our great supplements and books and films and t-shirts to fund the operation
[2:23:06.700 --> 2:23:09.340]  because they're great products and we're coming back and getting more and saying it
[2:23:09.340 --> 2:23:10.500]  for the sport.
[2:23:10.500 --> 2:23:14.820]  But whether it's DNA Force Plus or whether it's Pollen Block or whether it's Super
[2:23:14.820 --> 2:23:20.820]  Mobitality or Vaso Beats, because of the ongoing lockdowns around the world, we're not going
[2:23:20.820 --> 2:23:25.260]  to lower the quality of our products and so we just can't offer them, but thank God it
[2:23:25.260 --> 2:23:29.780]  looks like some good things are starting to happen right now because suddenly a lot of
[2:23:29.780 --> 2:23:33.740]  products have been sold out for a long time are back in stock, and one of them is Pollen
[2:23:33.740 --> 2:23:34.740]  Block.
[2:23:34.740 --> 2:23:38.780]  It takes a long time to get into Pollen Block, but it's for seasonal discomfort, stuff like
[2:23:38.780 --> 2:23:44.740]  allergies, it's from France, it's a special proprietary system, this is the highest quality
[2:23:44.740 --> 2:24:10.740]  back in stock, infowarstore.com, store line pre-shipping, and double patriot points,
[2:24:10.740 --> 2:24:19.740]  is in high gear.
[2:24:19.740 --> 2:24:25.900]  Mark of the Beast, implantable microchips are being announced, mourners wide open, millions
[2:24:25.900 --> 2:24:30.220]  of people, hundreds of thousands of children are being smuggled across, many of them given
[2:24:30.220 --> 2:24:36.580]  to sex traffickers, the FBI's wave background checks for where the children are even going,
[2:24:36.580 --> 2:24:43.420]  that's happening right now, but we're hearing all day about Tulsa, Oklahoma, and a race war
[2:24:43.420 --> 2:24:47.660]  that started out a hundred years ago and people aren't even being told why it started
[2:24:47.660 --> 2:24:55.220]  or what happened, they're just told a bunch of evil white people just randomly did something,
[2:24:55.220 --> 2:25:01.060]  and then it's a bunch of weird, lying, multinational anchors telling you that, we've got the rest
[2:25:01.060 --> 2:25:06.540]  of the story here in just a moment, but first our sponsors are great and one of the best
[2:25:06.540 --> 2:25:12.500]  is infowarstone.com, they're one of the biggest sellers of sat phones in the country, there's
[2:25:12.500 --> 2:25:17.180]  a lot of customers, board patrol, all of them, they're great folks, and they have one of
[2:25:17.180 --> 2:25:23.380]  the best deals out there where you get the phone, a $600 plus unit, for free with a charger
[2:25:23.380 --> 2:25:29.180]  and all the equipment and everything, it works anywhere you can see the sky, it's handheld,
[2:25:29.180 --> 2:25:34.900]  all you pay for is the minutes, and then everybody can call you for free from regular cell phones,
[2:25:34.900 --> 2:25:41.660]  the system, when you call out you get 150 minutes per month for just $99.95, that's infowarstone.com,
[2:25:41.660 --> 2:25:45.660]  then you can't be tracked, you can't be traced, they can't listen into it, the cell towers
[2:25:45.660 --> 2:25:50.020]  don't track you, it's amazing, so they're always tracking and logging what you're doing,
[2:25:50.020 --> 2:25:54.060]  that's what cell phones do, but not one of these sat phones, and everybody needs them,
[2:25:54.060 --> 2:25:56.300]  you can put it away in your car, put it away in your house, but I think you should get
[2:25:56.300 --> 2:26:01.740]  it, learn how to use it, it's very easy to use, infowarstone.com, infowarstone.com or
[2:26:01.740 --> 2:26:09.620]  941-955-1020, 941-955-1020, and ask the Alex Jones Special, it's one of the best deals
[2:26:09.620 --> 2:26:13.980]  you're going to find, and they're a great sponsor of this show.
[2:26:13.980 --> 2:26:18.580]  Now, separately, and I'm going to get back into this news, we're also running the biggest
[2:26:18.580 --> 2:26:24.940]  sale yet of the year, double patriot points on your next order, that means 10% off on
[2:26:24.940 --> 2:26:30.700]  whatever the cost of it is you buy, you get that going forward at infowarstone.com, storewide
[2:26:30.700 --> 2:26:35.940]  for shipping on the order you're making now, and it's 40-50% off on all the best selling
[2:26:35.940 --> 2:26:43.500]  products that have been sold out, and finally, in the last month or so, all of them came
[2:26:43.500 --> 2:26:46.700]  back in, a long list.
[2:26:46.700 --> 2:26:50.340]  We have a new product, of course, the Ionic Fizzy Magnesium Drink, everybody knows how
[2:26:50.340 --> 2:26:56.140]  great magnesium is, well, this is the two types of magnesium, it's the best quality
[2:26:56.140 --> 2:26:58.660]  you're going to find out, they're so good for your whole body, all your cells, your
[2:26:58.660 --> 2:27:02.580]  heart, your lungs, your brain, it's one of those really central things.
[2:27:02.580 --> 2:27:05.340]  Now, I'm going to tell you that everybody knows about Fizzy Drinks and how good they
[2:27:05.340 --> 2:27:09.740]  are for you with their magnesium base, well, this is really a great product.
[2:27:09.740 --> 2:27:14.460]  Get one canister for $19.95, get the second one for $14.95, that's a great deal.
[2:27:14.460 --> 2:27:19.100]  We also have DNA Force Plus, back in stock, 40% off, PolyBlock, back in stock, 40% off,
[2:27:19.100 --> 2:27:23.060]  Supermellal Vitality, 50% off, Prosthetic Gardens, it goes on and on, and that funds
[2:27:23.060 --> 2:27:28.580]  our operation and everything we're doing, and remember, it costs a lot for us to do
[2:27:28.580 --> 2:27:35.980]  this because we've got to pay for the satellites, the uplinks, the decoders, the encoders, all
[2:27:35.980 --> 2:27:43.340]  the crew, everything, every piece of software, everything basically, almost everything we
[2:27:43.340 --> 2:27:44.340]  had to build.
[2:27:44.340 --> 2:27:48.100]  And I'm not going to get into all the things they've done, the persecution, I'm not a loser
[2:27:48.100 --> 2:27:51.820]  and I'm not a victim, and I'm not going to sit there and whine about it, but they've
[2:27:51.820 --> 2:27:58.540]  gone through the last four years and scanned everything, and they go, oh, you're using
[2:27:58.540 --> 2:28:06.180]  this software for your InfoWars members on your shopping cart that allows people to have
[2:28:06.180 --> 2:28:10.980]  an account and to get Patriot points and to sign up for auto-ship, we're taking both
[2:28:10.980 --> 2:28:11.980]  those away from you.
[2:28:11.980 --> 2:28:16.580]  Well, I've paid for the software, sorry, sue us if you want, okay, well, we already
[2:28:16.580 --> 2:28:21.060]  had that built by a separate firm for us, and I'm not going to go over it all, but
[2:28:21.060 --> 2:28:25.780]  we started knowing this was happening a few years ago, so right when that happened that
[2:28:25.780 --> 2:28:30.780]  we go funny, we already paid to have both those developed, we had them ready, but it
[2:28:30.780 --> 2:28:33.180]  made us go ahead and move over to that, I mean, everything.
[2:28:33.180 --> 2:28:37.500]  So that which doesn't kill you only makes you stronger, that's really true, but then
[2:28:37.500 --> 2:28:42.660]  we take so much of our time up, squirreling around, trying to just stay on air.
[2:28:42.660 --> 2:28:47.300]  I mean, they death-threaded and got rid of all our sponsors six, seven years ago, so
[2:28:47.300 --> 2:28:51.180]  I kind of just, well, I went away for sponsors to direct sales, which we were already doing,
[2:28:51.180 --> 2:28:54.660]  and they try to go out to the suppliers, and we just, it goes on and on.
[2:28:54.660 --> 2:28:56.180]  This is a criminal takeover.
[2:28:56.180 --> 2:28:59.780]  They hate you, they hate America, they hate you if you're black, they hate you if you're
[2:28:59.780 --> 2:29:02.900]  white, they hate you if you got red blood, they hate you if you're independent, they
[2:29:02.900 --> 2:29:07.420]  hate you for being alive, they want the whole planet for themselves, and I'll hit that the
[2:29:07.420 --> 2:29:12.940]  final segment coming up, but let me finish up with Tulsa, the Tulsa massacre, the Tulsa
[2:29:12.940 --> 2:29:13.940]  massacre.
[2:29:13.940 --> 2:29:20.740]  See, they saw how the feds got really in trouble and got a black eye, no pun intended, for burning
[2:29:20.740 --> 2:29:25.100]  up Waco and killing that diverse, multi-racial group of people, and they knew they could
[2:29:25.100 --> 2:29:27.060]  have got correction town anytime they wanted.
[2:29:27.060 --> 2:29:31.900]  So that brought America together and realized that the feds and the new ATF director that
[2:29:31.900 --> 2:29:35.980]  helped murder everybody, he said he loved doing it, you know, posed with their skulls
[2:29:35.980 --> 2:29:40.380]  and everything, are a problem, that that could be the problem, a centralized out-of-control
[2:29:40.380 --> 2:29:43.300]  government that's unconstitutional.
[2:29:43.300 --> 2:29:49.460]  And so now they go, oh, well, we got a massacre 100 years ago, let's go talk about that.
[2:29:49.460 --> 2:29:55.980]  And it goes on and on and on, but let's just show for TV viewers, here's the Miami event,
[2:29:55.980 --> 2:30:00.300]  you know, I looked up that Miami nightclub and saw last week that it was a black club
[2:30:00.300 --> 2:30:05.740]  and I said on here, I said, you know, probably end up being a black club gang related, and
[2:30:05.740 --> 2:30:11.740]  sure enough, black guys get out of the car, they go shoot other black people, 20 innocent
[2:30:11.740 --> 2:30:15.380]  people, two people they think were in the rival gang.
[2:30:15.380 --> 2:30:19.060]  But you know, not very cool to go shoot the rival gang amongst a bunch of other people,
[2:30:19.060 --> 2:30:20.260]  but there you go.
[2:30:20.260 --> 2:30:28.300]  Now imagine you have five white people had got out, the police now have confirmed it's
[2:30:28.300 --> 2:30:33.820]  a rival black gang and gone and shot up the other gang.
[2:30:33.820 --> 2:30:38.020]  It would have been burned the country down, but that hasn't happened yet unless they can
[2:30:38.020 --> 2:30:42.620]  trigger a race war like Tulsa, where a bunch of whites do get killed, like the new black
[2:30:42.620 --> 2:30:44.140]  Panther Party says do.
[2:30:44.140 --> 2:30:47.420]  And if you go out and kill a couple hundred white people randomly, the bunch of crazy
[2:30:47.420 --> 2:30:50.540]  white people are going to start randomly killing black folks, and then we're off the
[2:30:50.540 --> 2:30:53.660]  races, everybody killing each other and the globalists sit back and laugh.
[2:30:53.660 --> 2:30:57.140]  And that's how Fauci and Bill Gates are going to get away with what they've done to everybody
[2:30:57.140 --> 2:31:00.500]  with these poison vaccines and their world government and the chai comms, because we're
[2:31:00.500 --> 2:31:03.460]  a bunch of dumbasses.
[2:31:03.460 --> 2:31:06.060]  Or we cannot be idiots and say no to this and wake up.
[2:31:06.060 --> 2:31:07.540]  Now let me show you the answer to this.
[2:31:07.540 --> 2:31:09.900]  Look at this big article, Moonchilds and Biproxy.
[2:31:09.900 --> 2:31:15.980]  White mom charged with medical child abuse for suggesting, subjecting black daughter
[2:31:15.980 --> 2:31:17.460]  to the unnecessary treatment.
[2:31:17.460 --> 2:31:20.940]  You guys actually pull up the Daily Mail article, it's chilling.
[2:31:20.940 --> 2:31:23.540]  And this woman got all this attention.
[2:31:23.540 --> 2:31:28.740]  She talked about what a virtue signal or she was how she was taking care of the black child
[2:31:28.740 --> 2:31:32.860]  for all these years, putting breathing tubes in her, doing all this stuff.
[2:31:32.860 --> 2:31:34.820]  The child thought this is my mommy.
[2:31:34.820 --> 2:31:40.740]  So I better do what she says and I better let her do all these treatments.
[2:31:40.740 --> 2:31:47.940]  This woman is a microcosm of the globalist, of the big banks, of Soros, of Apple and Google
[2:31:47.940 --> 2:31:51.420]  and Facebook giving billions to these race groups.
[2:31:51.420 --> 2:31:55.700]  They're hiding, they're evil behind black people, just like this woman was milking donations
[2:31:55.700 --> 2:31:58.660]  and money while she tortured this little black girl.
[2:31:58.660 --> 2:32:02.220]  I don't care if that girl is black or white, that's torture.
[2:32:02.220 --> 2:32:06.140]  And so these people become these heroes, they get all over the news how they're the
[2:32:06.140 --> 2:32:09.420]  white savior taking care of this little black girl.
[2:32:09.420 --> 2:32:13.660]  So that's what the big banks are doing.
[2:32:13.660 --> 2:32:18.460]  That's how they're literally taking the black community that's been kept in a bad position,
[2:32:18.460 --> 2:32:23.540]  kept down, allowed crime in the areas, gangster society, destroyed the black family, they're
[2:32:23.540 --> 2:32:26.980]  doing it to everybody else now and then play us all off against each other and that's the
[2:32:26.980 --> 2:32:31.380]  white liberal, the white globalist behind the whole thing, playing it off because they're
[2:32:31.380 --> 2:32:36.020]  not really a liberal, they're parasites and that dovetails with this, off-duty officers
[2:32:36.020 --> 2:32:41.100]  stop government from mass attack in Houston nightclub, you'll never hear because it's
[2:32:41.100 --> 2:32:42.100]  black on black.
[2:32:42.100 --> 2:32:46.180]  But here's another one, white crazy dude, planned mass shooting at Wal-Mart, stopped
[2:32:46.180 --> 2:32:52.820]  by a rest of Texas man, authority say, the point is there's evil in all colors.
[2:32:52.820 --> 2:32:55.780]  But imagine if you happen to shoot some black people, then it would be a greater crime.
[2:32:55.780 --> 2:32:59.060]  No, it's bad periods and it goes on from there.
[2:32:59.060 --> 2:33:05.060]  The answer is this article from NationalFile.com, Secretary for Kenya's Atheist Society announces
[2:33:05.060 --> 2:33:07.620]  he's found Jesus Christ resigns.
[2:33:07.620 --> 2:33:11.740]  We need to come together under Christ, under God, that's what everything shows.
[2:33:11.740 --> 2:33:16.700]  That's how we come together, that's how we're not controlled by these evil satanic forces.
[2:33:16.700 --> 2:33:20.060]  But there it is, ladies and gentlemen, just like she was using that black baby because
[2:33:20.060 --> 2:33:25.020]  the media makes blacks God, not because they're empowering blacks, but because they are putting
[2:33:25.020 --> 2:33:30.000]  them as their shield so then the white low-level people pretend they're black or they go get
[2:33:30.000 --> 2:33:34.100]  a black baby they adopt as a social worker and then go and do medical experiments on
[2:33:34.100 --> 2:33:39.100]  it to be the mama that's protecting the little kid when actually she's the one abusing it.
[2:33:39.100 --> 2:33:44.460]  And that's a microcosm of what Soros and the left are doing to everybody in general when
[2:33:44.460 --> 2:33:47.100]  they actually hate every damn one of us.
[2:33:47.100 --> 2:33:48.100]  We'll be right back.
[2:33:48.100 --> 2:33:53.220]  Stay with us, ladies and gentlemen.
[2:33:53.220 --> 2:33:55.180]  Your voice counts.

[2:34:00.180 --> 2:34:02.780]  The globalists know their agenda is unpopular.
[2:34:02.780 --> 2:34:04.300]  They know you're angry.
[2:34:04.300 --> 2:34:08.620]  And now to get around big tech, it's more important than ever that we use every tool
[2:34:08.620 --> 2:34:09.620]  we've got.

[2:35:56.340 --> 2:35:58.460]  air, it's been true.
[2:35:58.460 --> 2:36:04.220]  But Info Wars has never been in a position where your support is more critical and more
[2:36:04.220 --> 2:36:05.220]  vital.
[2:36:05.220 --> 2:36:08.260]  The enemy behind the scenes is doing so many things, I'm not going to take time up to
[2:36:08.260 --> 2:36:09.740]  why and about it, it's okay.
[2:36:09.740 --> 2:36:14.300]  I expect to be attacked because we're over the target, we're having a great effect, we
[2:36:14.300 --> 2:36:16.700]  are exposing evil, you're exposing evil.
[2:36:16.700 --> 2:36:20.100]  So when you spread the word about the broadcast or when you buy products or when you pray
[2:36:20.100 --> 2:36:25.380]  for Info Wars and our talk show hosts and our crew, it is so powerful.
[2:36:25.380 --> 2:36:31.820]  So again, as Memorial Day 2021 comes and goes, I want all of you to realize that I appreciate
[2:36:31.820 --> 2:36:35.820]  you as being veterans of the Info War and I particularly think our veterans as well
[2:36:35.820 --> 2:36:39.700]  that have served the armed forces because they understand what it is to sacrifice and
[2:36:39.700 --> 2:36:44.620]  they're needed more now than ever to be leaders in our republic to expose the globalist of
[2:36:44.620 --> 2:36:46.820]  the foreign takeover that we're in the middle of right now.
[2:36:46.820 --> 2:36:49.900]  So it's a very historical time to be alive, I want to thank you all for your support and
[2:36:49.900 --> 2:36:51.260]  ask you to support us again.
[2:36:51.260 --> 2:36:55.420]  In 60 seconds, I don't have time to tell you how amazing Polym Block is, but you should

[2:37:08.900 --> 2:37:15.220]  that quail that eat a certain diet produce eggs and eggshells that are amazing when people
[2:37:15.220 --> 2:37:20.100]  eat them for knocking out seasonal discomfort or what folks call allergies.

[2:37:54.540 --> 2:38:12.300]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[2:38:12.300 --> 2:38:18.700]  Welcome back to the end of the Alex Jones section of today's transmission, but we've
[2:38:18.700 --> 2:38:26.420]  got coming up a very informative guest host, Paul Joseph Watson, and I'm going to be hosting
[2:38:26.420 --> 2:38:32.940]  tomorrow, not just my regular show, I'm going to be hosting the war room with Rob Duke as
[2:38:32.940 --> 2:38:39.940]  Owen Schreuer is getting some well-deserved time to go visit his family in Missouri.
[2:38:39.940 --> 2:38:47.140]  But let me just finish up with something we've been covering, is this attempted race war,
[2:38:47.140 --> 2:38:51.420]  this attempt that whites are inherently bad by the corporations, by the media, by big tech,
[2:38:51.420 --> 2:38:57.580]  by the chai comms, it's all just a very cynical divide and conquer in their own words, but
[2:38:57.580 --> 2:39:01.540]  look at this video, I don't have time to get to it, it's on infowars.com.
[2:39:01.540 --> 2:39:09.740]  Watch students sign, cancel Memorial Day petition, it's a celebration of U.S. imperialism and
[2:39:09.740 --> 2:39:10.740]  colonialism.
[2:39:10.740 --> 2:39:14.140]  Boy, didn't everybody want to live under the U.S. Empire, now they're living under the
[2:39:14.140 --> 2:39:19.220]  Communist Chinese Empire, so what will be the dominant system we're under?
[2:39:19.220 --> 2:39:23.620]  It certainly is an American system, it's a total system of poverty, medical tyranny,
[2:39:23.620 --> 2:39:28.700]  divide and conquer, dehumanization, what did George R. R. Well say, there will be no curiosity,
[2:39:28.700 --> 2:39:33.100]  no enjoyment, or the process of life, all competing pleasures will be destroyed, but
[2:39:33.100 --> 2:39:39.140]  always, do not forget this Winston, always there will be the intoxication of power constantly
[2:39:39.140 --> 2:39:43.900]  increasing and constantly growing subtler, always at every moment there will be the thrill
[2:39:43.900 --> 2:39:48.540]  of victory, the sensation of trampling on the enemy, who is helpless, if you want a
[2:39:48.540 --> 2:39:53.340]  picture of the future, imagine a boot stomping on the human face forever.
[2:39:53.340 --> 2:40:02.820]  So we have Jocelyn Adams, shot in the face, killed in a drive-thru hamburger shop, for
[2:40:02.820 --> 2:40:08.620]  absolutely no reason, you got white devils coming and trying to save her, and you don't
[2:40:08.620 --> 2:40:13.140]  even ever learn her name, the media never really says it, you know, we had to dig it
[2:40:13.140 --> 2:40:20.580]  up, but see that's the reality of what goes on here, meanwhile we're all being targeted
[2:40:20.580 --> 2:40:24.620]  by the globalist for extinction, we're all being dehumanized, and let me lead you now
[2:40:24.620 --> 2:40:33.460]  to what I mentioned earlier in the last hour right now, the rest of the story, fertility,
[2:40:33.460 --> 2:40:39.060]  and the attack on humanity, I'm going to shoot some special reports on this because this
[2:40:39.060 --> 2:40:53.220]  is really front and center now, communist China, communist China, if you were lower class,
[2:40:53.220 --> 2:40:57.700]  they didn't force it on party members, the million or so party members, but the other
[2:40:57.700 --> 2:41:04.140]  billion or so people under the system would be killed, you'd be taken to a labor camp
[2:41:04.140 --> 2:41:07.620]  and they would take your baby, it was already born in harvest its organs, if you were pregnant
[2:41:07.620 --> 2:41:12.940]  they would do a forced abortion, and our media praised that as loving and liberal, meaning
[2:41:12.940 --> 2:41:19.020]  they'd put you under that if they could, well now China's decided to break with the globalist,
[2:41:19.020 --> 2:41:22.300]  they were given all the military power, all the economic power as part of the subject
[2:41:22.300 --> 2:41:26.980]  plan to lead the way into sterilization, but the Chinese government I told you a month
[2:41:26.980 --> 2:41:32.540]  ago said, we won the bio war with America, they admitted they did it, and we're going
[2:41:32.540 --> 2:41:39.060]  to now, permanently shut them down, but we need three children, and we recommend you
[2:41:39.060 --> 2:41:43.580]  abort most of your daughters, we want more men to export as we take the world over, our
[2:41:43.580 --> 2:41:48.940]  Chinese men will take African and American and European and Latin American wives, that's
[2:41:48.940 --> 2:41:54.820]  actually a plan of genetic colonization, but that's okay because they're Asian, so Hitler
[2:41:54.820 --> 2:42:02.380]  level stuff from Asians is okay, China raises cap on births to three in major policy ship,
[2:42:02.380 --> 2:42:07.660]  that the Fabian socialist Trudeau of Canada really praises, you know you can make decisions
[2:42:07.660 --> 2:42:13.740]  like that, like Biden said, married Chinese couples may have three children, China announced
[2:42:13.740 --> 2:42:18.940]  on Monday in a major shift from the existing limit of two, every recent data showed a dramatic
[2:42:18.940 --> 2:42:22.620]  decline in births in the world's most populous country, and of course they ended in one cell
[2:42:22.620 --> 2:42:25.940]  policy five years ago and said okay you can have two, but well they're just not having
[2:42:25.940 --> 2:42:29.820]  them because they've been so sterilized, and that leads us to this, mercury poisoning makes
[2:42:29.820 --> 2:42:36.340]  birds homosexual, national geographic, almost every major bird species is seeing massive
[2:42:36.340 --> 2:42:41.140]  declines that are around any industrialized areas because the male birds try to have sex
[2:42:41.140 --> 2:42:47.160]  with other male birds when they are in contact with mercury, that's why the Romans started
[2:42:47.160 --> 2:42:51.860]  lining their pots with lead towards their decline, they became psychotic, more warlocked
[2:42:51.860 --> 2:42:58.580]  and homosexual, and again I don't hate people that are into the same sex, I'm explaining
[2:42:58.580 --> 2:43:05.540]  this as being done to end us, like the birds or major colonies of birds are collapsing,
[2:43:05.540 --> 2:43:10.420]  major groups of frogs are coming extinct, because they're so trendy, oh and don't worry
[2:43:10.420 --> 2:43:18.620]  they have articles making fun of me with blues clues with the gay frogs and mollock with
[2:43:18.620 --> 2:43:22.420]  a child being sacrificed, that's even on it, but that's for another show, I'm out of time
[2:43:22.420 --> 2:43:29.740]  there, mercury poisoning makes birds act homosexual, national geographic, researchers this is new,
[2:43:29.740 --> 2:43:35.740]  this is really big, researchers in Japan say soybean compound to make catfish 100% female
[2:43:35.740 --> 2:43:43.140]  and all the studies if you eat soy from the full soybean, which is what Henry Ford started
[2:43:43.140 --> 2:43:47.020]  the processing of, before that you didn't feed soybeans to humans, if you eat the center
[2:43:47.020 --> 2:43:52.740]  of the soybean you might as well go take estrogen, and that's why whether you're black or whether
[2:43:52.740 --> 2:43:57.500]  you're white or Hispanic, if mothers that eat a lot of soy in utero the boy's penis
[2:43:57.500 --> 2:44:03.500]  is smaller and smaller testicles and lower sperm count, so it's a cocktail of soy, it's
[2:44:03.500 --> 2:44:08.060]  a cocktail of phthalates, it's all there, remember they had Stephen Colbert and all
[2:44:08.060 --> 2:44:11.780]  of them attacked me a few years ago saying, Jones is insane when I warned of this because
[2:44:11.780 --> 2:44:16.540]  they want to make sure it becomes a joke to you, so that when it actually comes out you
[2:44:16.540 --> 2:44:19.420]  subconsciously have already been programmed to think it's funny, so you don't take it
[2:44:19.420 --> 2:44:26.260]  as a threat, oh but nobody's going to tell you that's happening, Japanese researchers
[2:44:26.260 --> 2:44:30.900]  use soybean compound to turn male fish into females, infowars.com wrote a big story about
[2:44:30.900 --> 2:44:39.660]  it, Paul Joseph Watson, very damn important, it had 13,000 retweets, retweets, blues, clues,
[2:44:39.660 --> 2:44:43.980]  gay frogs and scare Alex Jones, no that helped push me to number one this weekend on Twitter,
[2:44:43.980 --> 2:44:47.700]  so I was so scared to see us trending number one and being proven right, oh my gosh the
[2:44:47.700 --> 2:44:52.020]  left really got to me, and of course that ties into all these articles looking forward
[2:44:52.020 --> 2:44:55.820]  to the end of the Humanity Wall Street Journal, how wrong are these sterile fertility crisis
[2:44:55.820 --> 2:45:02.860]  women will no longer have sperm by 2045, says top epidemiologist, and here's an old article
[2:45:02.860 --> 2:45:08.100]  from 15 years ago celebrating the plan, human species will split into two under a UN operation,
[2:45:08.100 --> 2:45:11.940]  that's going to happen very, very quickly, and that's the general public after being
[2:45:11.940 --> 2:45:17.060]  radiated and given all the GMO, that's the globalist, they describe us as goblin like
[2:45:17.060 --> 2:45:26.860]  creatures, scientists propose lunar arc to store 6.7 million sperm samples as global
[2:45:26.860 --> 2:45:30.900]  insurance policy from total collapse, that's the whole children of men program in your
[2:45:30.900 --> 2:45:37.340]  face, just simply incredible, what are the sperm telling us, New York Times, plummeting
[2:45:37.340 --> 2:45:42.300]  sperm counts, shrinking, penises, toxic chemicals, threatened humanity, oh but when I said it
[2:45:42.300 --> 2:45:45.860]  I was a liar even though I was reading the documents 20 years ago, now it's in the Lening
[2:45:45.860 --> 2:45:50.900]  Guardian today, they're going to all get big awards, add failing sperm counts to the list
[2:45:50.900 --> 2:45:55.660]  of threats to human survival, and again they can put out plastics easily without the hardening
[2:45:55.660 --> 2:45:59.900]  agent that's the same, but they pick it on purpose as a global agreement, just like the
[2:45:59.900 --> 2:46:04.700]  big jet fuel groups as part of the Manhattan style project, add barium salt to the oxide
[2:46:04.700 --> 2:46:09.740]  to the jet fuel, then the average person doesn't know why persistent contrails continue thus
[2:46:09.740 --> 2:46:15.220]  blocking out some from the earth and dimming the planet all part of a larger operation,
[2:46:15.220 --> 2:46:20.140]  just like the plastic formula out of thousands they choose causes sterilization, they don't
[2:46:20.140 --> 2:46:23.540]  have to do that but they do it.
[2:46:23.540 --> 2:46:27.660]  Here's another one, the Atlantic, a big article, the nuclear family was a mistake, get rid
[2:46:27.660 --> 2:46:34.620]  of it, despite the fact that every study shows nuclear families are the healthiest, the best,
[2:46:34.620 --> 2:46:38.980]  they're natural, but see they want to get rid of humans so the nuclear family's bad,
[2:46:38.980 --> 2:46:43.060]  they want you owing no allegiance but to them while you're being killed, they are your enemy,
[2:46:43.060 --> 2:46:46.460]  but don't tell the new black Panther Party that, who broke up their family, who hurt
[2:46:46.460 --> 2:46:50.860]  them, just tell them it's the average poor white person panhandling on the side of the
[2:46:50.860 --> 2:46:54.380]  road, if he just gets shot in the head it'll all be fine, oh and look, the nuclear family
[2:46:54.380 --> 2:47:00.060]  they tell you not to have is black, look, oh, oh, the nuclear family, oh especially the,
[2:47:00.060 --> 2:47:03.860]  what does black ones matter say, we don't want nuclear families, we don't want nuclear,
[2:47:03.860 --> 2:47:07.980]  we don't want men in the house and we want to pay to have black men have their genitals
[2:47:07.980 --> 2:47:12.380]  removed and it's breaking that Republicans in Texas have been caught involved with top
[2:47:12.380 --> 2:47:18.020]  Democrats funding a multi-billion dollar over the last few years program of sterilizing
[2:47:18.020 --> 2:47:21.820]  the Hispanic immigrants that come here by saying, have your balls cut off and we'll
[2:47:21.820 --> 2:47:29.420]  make you a U.S. citizen, but you won't hear LaRosa say a damn word about that, whoo,
[2:47:29.420 --> 2:47:34.900]  all right, look, I gotta, I'm gonna start the show with this tomorrow, I meant to get
[2:47:34.900 --> 2:47:39.220]  to this, it's so huge, but this is just the tip of the iceberg, but man, print me that
[2:47:39.220 --> 2:47:43.260]  article about, we gotta get rid of the nuclear family and it shows black people, so while
[2:47:43.260 --> 2:47:47.300]  they're busy getting rid of everybody and really targeting blacks, every show is like
[2:47:47.300 --> 2:47:51.580]  we love blacks, every corporate sponsor, black, black, black, look, our actors are black,
[2:47:51.580 --> 2:47:59.380]  our people in our ad are black, I was talking to a major Hollywood individual that was contacted
[2:47:59.380 --> 2:48:03.100]  me and they were talking about their manager or their agent, now they tell people, you've
[2:48:03.100 --> 2:48:07.380]  got to be black now to be in anything, it's not to help black people, the globalists are
[2:48:07.380 --> 2:48:12.300]  literally morphing like the thing into a black shell to not attack them, don't overthrow
[2:48:12.300 --> 2:48:16.820]  the new world order, don't overthrow the banks, don't have the Rothschilds, we're black, we're
[2:48:16.820 --> 2:48:21.500]  black, don't attack us, we're black, it's like the thing where it grabs a human, turns into
[2:48:21.500 --> 2:48:26.340]  it, I'm not an alien, I'm a man, I'm a, just say to, I'm, you trust me, I'm black, I'm
[2:48:26.340 --> 2:48:31.820]  the new world order, I'm black, I mean, my God, this is obvious, holy hell, I was in
[2:48:31.820 --> 2:48:36.220]  there getting caught during the break, watch three ads, nothing but black people on it,
[2:48:36.220 --> 2:48:40.740]  on purpose, ha ha ha.

[2:49:51.700 --> 2:50:16.580]  Come on over here.
[2:50:46.580 --> 2:50:47.580]  show.
[2:50:47.580 --> 2:51:12.580]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide is Alex Jones.
[2:51:12.580 --> 2:51:32.580]  I believe you're probably surprised, I pray, and the sky is gray.
[2:51:32.580 --> 2:51:52.580]  What was done in the 50s and 60s tested in the 20s by Margaret Sanger and the Rockefeller Foundation.
[2:51:52.580 --> 2:51:59.580]  The same ones that run the whole great reset COVID-19 operation lockstep.
[2:51:59.580 --> 2:52:04.580]  They went in and bought off the black religious leaders in New York as a beta test for the rest of the country.
[2:52:04.580 --> 2:52:09.580]  And they said, these IBM computers to program it, this is all on record.
[2:52:09.580 --> 2:52:16.580]  And they said, hey, we've been able to basically take black families that were some of the most compact and successful in the country.
[2:52:16.580 --> 2:52:24.580]  They had a lower level back then of even white promiscuity and white illegitimacy.
[2:52:24.580 --> 2:52:26.580]  That is not having a father in the home.
[2:52:26.580 --> 2:52:32.580]  And by the 60s, they had totally reversed those numbers and now upwards of 80% of black families are broken up.
[2:52:32.580 --> 2:52:39.580]  This article in the Atlantic says the nuclear family was a mistake, uses black people as an example and says it's very liberating and good to get rid of it.
[2:52:39.580 --> 2:52:45.580]  They say that the nuclear family was a short, happy life of the nuclear family.
[2:52:45.580 --> 2:52:51.580]  But now it's been gotten rid of and we've gotten rid of clans and it shows a picture of a family together and blurred their faces out.
[2:52:51.580 --> 2:53:00.580]  No one has anybody just like they've done to the black people and now our sons can be led by gang members just like they did to blacks and be put in prison.
[2:53:00.580 --> 2:53:03.580]  And the enemy wins.
[2:53:03.580 --> 2:53:07.580]  And that's now they're breaking up the whole human family with their race war.
[2:53:07.580 --> 2:53:22.580]  Meanwhile, Paul Joseph Watson has a new article on fours.com. He takes over in a few minutes. UK records zero cuba deaths pro lockdown advisor told to shut up as the country basically still kept under lockdown.
[2:53:22.580 --> 2:53:27.580]  But that's all done by turning the PCR test down to 28 or 29 cycles. All of it is a fraud. You've got to destroy the fraud or they'll keep bringing it back.
[2:53:27.580 --> 2:53:29.580]  But they know there's a huge tipping point.
[2:53:29.580 --> 2:53:33.580]  So then they pulled back because of how many scientists and doctors have gone public.
[2:53:33.580 --> 2:53:44.580]  They did a good show today. Powerful, but I didn't get to the five or six new doctor interviews with PhD scientists all over the world from New Zealand to the US to Canada to Europe saying this is pure bull, pure evil.
[2:53:44.580 --> 2:53:47.580]  We're seeing mass death from the vaccines. It's pure poison.
[2:53:47.580 --> 2:53:51.580]  Major studies out on that subject, but the whole show can't be covered all the time.
[2:53:51.580 --> 2:53:57.580]  But my God, this is their takeover plan is the covered mass brave of 215 children in Canada.
[2:53:57.580 --> 2:54:03.580]  It's not a reminder of the dark history of Native American boarding schools in the US, but it's all still ongoing.
[2:54:03.580 --> 2:54:11.580]  And I years ago had Native American leaders on to expose this 20 years ago, 10 years ago, but you never see the media pick up on that.
[2:54:11.580 --> 2:54:16.580]  Now they're doing it because now there's the push to say white people did it and not eugenics.
[2:54:16.580 --> 2:54:21.580]  It's been eugenics groups that did it and that led it.
[2:54:21.580 --> 2:54:29.580]  And that monster to do that eugenics is to do his father, the Fabian socialist that wants Chinese style communism.
[2:54:29.580 --> 2:54:33.580]  In Canada and Canada is a microcosm of where we're going.
[2:54:33.580 --> 2:54:35.580]  So it is extremely dangerous.
[2:54:35.580 --> 2:54:39.580]  A poll takes over for 55 minutes after this break.
[2:54:39.580 --> 2:54:43.580]  And then the war room today.
[2:54:43.580 --> 2:54:45.580]  Paul Watson does the next hour, but.
[2:54:45.580 --> 2:54:49.580]  Oh, Troyer is off this week and well deserved recharge.
[2:54:49.580 --> 2:54:51.580]  So who's who's hosting the war room?
[2:54:51.580 --> 2:54:53.580]  Say that again.
[2:54:53.580 --> 2:55:00.580]  Harris and Smith pulling double duty hosting today and I'm going to be hosting some this week with a lot of big special guests.
[2:55:00.580 --> 2:55:02.580]  Roger Stone's got a lot more not ready to break today.
[2:55:02.580 --> 2:55:09.580]  He'll be breaking tomorrow's big stuff on the first hour of the war room 3pm central standard time.
[2:55:09.580 --> 2:55:13.580]  So the host of American Journal is going to be hosting today.
[2:55:13.580 --> 2:55:17.580]  And I've got a lot to cover and a lot to do in a bunch of special reports haven't done yet.
[2:55:17.580 --> 2:55:19.580]  So who knows those may end up on that show today.
[2:55:19.580 --> 2:55:23.580]  Whatever you do, please tune in because your word of mouth is king.

[2:57:12.580 --> 2:57:30.580]  Hello everyone and welcome to the Summit News Hour, where the scientific dictatorship,
[2:57:30.580 --> 2:57:37.580]  which has had a stranglehold of the Western world for over a year now, continues to refuse
[2:57:37.580 --> 2:57:44.580]  to relinquish its control over our lives, our behavior, who we associate with, where we go,
[2:57:44.580 --> 2:57:47.580]  what we do, everything under the sun.
[2:57:47.580 --> 2:57:50.580]  We've now recorded in the UK today.
[2:57:50.580 --> 2:57:56.580]  And the headline is UK records zero COVID deaths, clues in the headline, pro lockdown
[2:57:56.580 --> 2:57:58.580]  advisor told to shut up.
[2:57:58.580 --> 2:58:05.580]  So we've recorded zero COVID deaths for the first time since March, early March, 2020,
[2:58:05.580 --> 2:58:08.580]  before the first official lockdown.
[2:58:08.580 --> 2:58:12.580]  And yet what do we see day after day after day?
[2:58:12.580 --> 2:58:16.580]  Government advisors saying, oh my God, the situation is apocalyptic.
[2:58:16.580 --> 2:58:19.580]  We're going to have to lock down again.
[2:58:19.580 --> 2:58:25.580]  There's literally zero people dying, even by their official inflated numbers.
[2:58:25.580 --> 2:58:27.580]  Zero people.
[2:58:27.580 --> 2:58:33.580]  One person died yesterday, bearing mind this is over the past 28 day period that they count these deaths.
[2:58:33.580 --> 2:58:36.580]  One person died yesterday in the entirety of the UK.
[2:58:36.580 --> 2:58:39.580]  Zero people died in England itself.
[2:58:39.580 --> 2:58:43.580]  Now across the whole of the UK, zero COVID deaths.
[2:58:43.580 --> 2:58:46.580]  And yet you still have these pro lockdown advisors.
[2:58:46.580 --> 2:58:50.580]  And the main fault from my perspective doesn't even lie with the advisors.
[2:58:50.580 --> 2:58:51.580]  They grift us.
[2:58:51.580 --> 2:58:53.580]  They got into the limelight.
[2:58:53.580 --> 2:58:58.580]  They got the clout from being the scientific dictatorship from taking their perch on the
[2:58:58.580 --> 2:59:05.580]  peanut gallery for the past year by being these big vaunted scientific establishment
[2:59:05.580 --> 2:59:11.580]  authorities that get to dictate how you live your life when you can see your grandma or your kids.
[2:59:11.580 --> 2:59:17.580]  So the obvious motivation for them is there to try to stay in the limelight by continually
[2:59:17.580 --> 2:59:23.580]  hyping up the fear mongering scare propaganda that has left people in such a state that we
[2:59:23.580 --> 2:59:28.580]  literally now have a new mental illness called COVID-19 Anxiety Disorder,
[2:59:28.580 --> 2:59:30.580]  which many people are suffering.
[2:59:30.580 --> 2:59:37.580]  Apparently it's turned them into weak rusted jellyfish agrofolks who are afraid to leave their
[2:59:37.580 --> 2:59:42.580]  own homes, afraid to go outside because they think death is around every corner,
[2:59:42.580 --> 2:59:47.580]  despite the fact that as we've documented many times over and over again,
[2:59:47.580 --> 2:59:54.580]  the survival rate for COVID, which the WHO at the beginning of this fear mongering campaign
[2:59:54.580 --> 2:59:59.580]  said was 3.6% and they made very little effort to correct that,
[2:59:59.580 --> 3:00:05.580]  is actually for healthy people under a certain age, 99.8%,
[3:00:05.580 --> 3:00:10.580]  even more depending on what barometer you look at.
[3:00:10.580 --> 3:00:14.580]  So on the day that the UK recorded zero coronavirus deaths for the first time
[3:00:14.580 --> 3:00:17.580]  since before the first lockdown over a year ago,
[3:00:17.580 --> 3:00:22.580]  a government advisor who wants lockdown restrictions to remain in place
[3:00:22.580 --> 3:00:26.580]  says he's being told to shut up.
[3:00:26.580 --> 3:00:29.580]  Thank God that people are telling him to shut up.
[3:00:29.580 --> 3:00:35.580]  What kind of political capital do you have to want the entire country to lock down again
[3:00:35.580 --> 3:00:38.580]  for these restrictions, which are still in place, by the way,
[3:00:38.580 --> 3:00:41.580]  to a great extent until the 21st of June,
[3:00:41.580 --> 3:00:45.580]  to remain in place when literally zero people are dying?
[3:00:45.580 --> 3:00:49.580]  Probably more people died today from drowning in a swimming pool
[3:00:49.580 --> 3:00:52.580]  and we don't have that many swimming pools in the United Kingdom
[3:00:52.580 --> 3:00:54.580]  because it's a very cold place indeed.
[3:00:54.580 --> 3:00:58.580]  What political capital do they even have to get this attention?
[3:00:58.580 --> 3:01:00.580]  But again, who's giving them the attention?
[3:01:00.580 --> 3:01:02.580]  It's the mainstream media.
[3:01:02.580 --> 3:01:05.580]  It's BBC News, the state-funded broadcaster.
[3:01:05.580 --> 3:01:07.580]  It's Sky News.
[3:01:07.580 --> 3:01:11.580]  I mean, these people who've been proven wrong time and time again
[3:01:11.580 --> 3:01:15.580]  with their apocalyptic modelling, which is frankly ridiculous,
[3:01:15.580 --> 3:01:19.580]  half a million people dead, they said, complete bunk,
[3:01:19.580 --> 3:01:23.580]  still giving them the attention, the limelight, the authority
[3:01:23.580 --> 3:01:26.580]  to make these predictions, to make these scaremongering,
[3:01:26.580 --> 3:01:31.580]  fear-mongering proclamations that we're going to have another wave
[3:01:31.580 --> 3:01:33.580]  that many more people are going to die.
[3:01:33.580 --> 3:01:36.580]  They should be completely ignored and, yes,
[3:01:36.580 --> 3:01:38.580]  be told to shut up.
[3:01:38.580 --> 3:01:40.580]  That's exactly what people should be telling them,
[3:01:40.580 --> 3:01:45.580]  and yet Sky News BBC is still giving them the most prominent attention,
[3:01:45.580 --> 3:01:52.580]  even more so in some cases than before or right as the pandemic was beginning.
[3:01:52.580 --> 3:01:55.580]  So again, after recording just one COVID death yesterday,
[3:01:55.580 --> 3:01:58.580]  the whole of the UK reported no deaths whatsoever today.
[3:01:58.580 --> 3:02:03.580]  There was government scientists are literally crying into their cornflakes
[3:02:03.580 --> 3:02:06.580]  this morning upon learning that news.
[3:02:06.580 --> 3:02:08.580]  Oh, my God, it's disappearing.
[3:02:08.580 --> 3:02:09.580]  Nobody's dying anymore.
[3:02:09.580 --> 3:02:11.580]  How are we going to get on TV?
[3:02:11.580 --> 3:02:14.580]  How are we going to get our 15 minutes of fame?
[3:02:14.580 --> 3:02:18.580]  How are we going to continue to get our unearned clout?
[3:02:18.580 --> 3:02:22.580]  Seriously, it's not just the scientists.
[3:02:22.580 --> 3:02:25.580]  Seriously, these people, these brainwashed sheep
[3:02:25.580 --> 3:02:29.580]  who have invested their entire identity into supporting lockdown
[3:02:29.580 --> 3:02:33.580]  and the polls show it's a vast, clear majority of the British population,
[3:02:33.580 --> 3:02:37.580]  mainly because a lot of them are being paid their wages by the government
[3:02:37.580 --> 3:02:41.580]  on furlough to sit on their arses all day and do absolutely nothing,
[3:02:41.580 --> 3:02:45.580]  play Xbox and watch YouTube videos.
[3:02:45.580 --> 3:02:48.580]  They've religiously supported the lockdowns,
[3:02:48.580 --> 3:02:51.580]  religiously supported the cult-like mass mandates
[3:02:51.580 --> 3:02:54.580]  and it finally looks like it's coming to an end.
[3:02:54.580 --> 3:03:00.580]  Those people are absolutely devastated that nobody has died of COVID today
[3:03:00.580 --> 3:03:02.580]  according to the official record.
[3:03:02.580 --> 3:03:03.580]  They're devastated.
[3:03:03.580 --> 3:03:04.580]  They want more deaths.
[3:03:04.580 --> 3:03:05.580]  They want more illness.
[3:03:05.580 --> 3:03:09.580]  They want it to continue to infinity
[3:03:09.580 --> 3:03:11.580]  because that's how they define themselves.
[3:03:11.580 --> 3:03:13.580]  That's how they define their personality.
[3:03:13.580 --> 3:03:15.580]  That's how they judge other people.
[3:03:15.580 --> 3:03:19.580]  That's how they look at videos of people enjoying themselves on the beach
[3:03:19.580 --> 3:03:22.580]  this past bank holiday Monday weekend.
[3:03:22.580 --> 3:03:25.580]  God forbid people should actually enjoy their lives,
[3:03:25.580 --> 3:03:27.580]  go out and meet their friends and relatives.
[3:03:27.580 --> 3:03:31.580]  Those are the kind of sad curtain twitchers who have no friends.
[3:03:31.580 --> 3:03:35.580]  Nobody wants to hang out with them because they're miserable bastards.
[3:03:35.580 --> 3:03:37.580]  So they want this to continue forever.
[3:03:37.580 --> 3:03:40.580]  Then of course you have the sage government advisors
[3:03:40.580 --> 3:03:42.580]  who get their entire raise on debtor,
[3:03:42.580 --> 3:03:45.580]  their entire plow out of being that authority figure.
[3:03:45.580 --> 3:03:47.580]  Well, it's coming to an end.
[3:03:47.580 --> 3:03:51.580]  Hopefully touch what it looks like it's coming to an end.
[3:03:51.580 --> 3:03:56.580]  Sky News is reporting the last time there were no deaths on any day
[3:03:56.580 --> 3:03:59.580]  was 7th of March 2020 before the first lockdown.
[3:03:59.580 --> 3:04:02.580]  However, despite deaths having been plummeting for weeks,
[3:04:02.580 --> 3:04:06.580]  then bear in mind they started to lift these restrictions again
[3:04:06.580 --> 3:04:09.580]  against the advice of many of these government scientists
[3:04:09.580 --> 3:04:12.580]  who want them to remain in place forever,
[3:04:12.580 --> 3:04:15.580]  started to lift them on the 12th of April.
[3:04:15.580 --> 3:04:18.580]  So we're talking about over six weeks ago now,
[3:04:18.580 --> 3:04:22.580]  they allowed us to go outside in a pub
[3:04:22.580 --> 3:04:26.580]  when it was pissing down with rain and like three degrees.
[3:04:26.580 --> 3:04:28.580]  They allowed us that privilege.
[3:04:28.580 --> 3:04:30.580]  Six weeks after that,
[3:04:30.580 --> 3:04:34.580]  weeks after we've been allowed to meet other people indoors.
[3:04:34.580 --> 3:04:36.580]  Oh my God, can you imagine?
[3:04:36.580 --> 3:04:40.580]  Can you imagine being able to meet five other of your friends indoors?
[3:04:40.580 --> 3:04:42.580]  Thank God for the government.
[3:04:42.580 --> 3:04:45.580]  Nothing happened. There's no explosion in deaths.
[3:04:45.580 --> 3:04:49.580]  This Indian variant, which they hoped would have a 50%
[3:04:49.580 --> 3:04:52.580]  transmissibility rate, hasn't proven to be the case.
[3:04:52.580 --> 3:04:56.580]  Even in the Muslim areas at Bolton and Blackburn
[3:04:56.580 --> 3:04:59.580]  where this supposed Indian variant was exploding,
[3:04:59.580 --> 3:05:02.580]  hospitalizations have decreased.
[3:05:02.580 --> 3:05:06.580]  No people are dying basically, zero people are dying today.
[3:05:06.580 --> 3:05:10.580]  They're devastated that they can gin it up,
[3:05:10.580 --> 3:05:13.580]  hype it up for more fear mongering.
[3:05:13.580 --> 3:05:15.580]  We have this professor, Adam Finn,
[3:05:15.580 --> 3:05:17.580]  being quoted by Yahoo News.
[3:05:17.580 --> 3:05:21.580]  This is an individual from the Joint Committee
[3:05:21.580 --> 3:05:23.580]  on Vaccination and Immunization
[3:05:23.580 --> 3:05:26.580]  who is demanding that the final stage of unlocking
[3:05:26.580 --> 3:05:28.580]  on June 21st be delayed,
[3:05:28.580 --> 3:05:32.580]  even though we've literally got zero people dying of COVID.
[3:05:32.580 --> 3:05:36.580]  We've probably got more people dying of putting their pants on
[3:05:36.580 --> 3:05:39.580]  and falling over, which is actually the real statistic
[3:05:39.580 --> 3:05:43.580]  for young people under the age of 16 who have died from COVID.
[3:05:43.580 --> 3:05:45.580]  More people died from putting their pants on
[3:05:45.580 --> 3:05:47.580]  and falling over because it's so deadly
[3:05:47.580 --> 3:05:50.580]  and all those kids need to take the vaccine.
[3:05:50.580 --> 3:05:53.580]  Professor Finn said, quote,
[3:05:53.580 --> 3:05:55.580]  there are a lot of people who are very fed up
[3:05:55.580 --> 3:05:57.580]  about the idea of us even worrying about this.
[3:05:57.580 --> 3:05:59.580]  Oh, under why?
[3:05:59.580 --> 3:06:01.580]  Is that because they haven't been able to see their grandma
[3:06:01.580 --> 3:06:07.580]  who's 82 years old and about to die for the past 15 months?
[3:06:07.580 --> 3:06:09.580]  Do you think that's why they're fed up?
[3:06:09.580 --> 3:06:11.580]  He went on to say,
[3:06:11.580 --> 3:06:13.580]  since I've been saying in the last 24 hours
[3:06:13.580 --> 3:06:15.580]  that we should be cautious,
[3:06:15.580 --> 3:06:17.580]  I've been getting lots of messages from people
[3:06:17.580 --> 3:06:19.580]  telling me, basically, to shut up.
[3:06:19.580 --> 3:06:23.580]  And that's from what I can tell
[3:06:23.580 --> 3:06:25.580]  from reading these news articles,
[3:06:25.580 --> 3:06:28.580]  people within the government itself,
[3:06:28.580 --> 3:06:32.580]  which, finally, TouchWord maybe has found a backbone
[3:06:32.580 --> 3:06:35.580]  and realized that a virus from which
[3:06:35.580 --> 3:06:38.580]  99.8% of young healthy people survived,
[3:06:38.580 --> 3:06:40.580]  maybe they shouldn't need to get the vaccine,
[3:06:40.580 --> 3:06:43.580]  is not as fearful, not as threatening
[3:06:43.580 --> 3:06:45.580]  as we originally thought it would be.
[3:06:45.580 --> 3:06:47.580]  In fact, summit.news.org.
[3:06:47.580 --> 3:06:50.580]  One of the most popular memes on the Internet
[3:06:50.580 --> 3:06:53.580]  in the last decade has been Alex Jones was right,
[3:06:53.580 --> 3:06:56.580]  but it now routinely trends number one
[3:06:56.580 --> 3:06:59.580]  on platforms like Twitter and Facebook
[3:06:59.580 --> 3:07:02.580]  making the globalists pull their hair out in anger.
[3:07:02.580 --> 3:07:05.580]  Well, let me tell you, we are Tomorrow's News today
[3:07:05.580 --> 3:07:07.580]  and thanks to your support, we're still on air
[3:07:07.580 --> 3:07:09.580]  at infowards.com and Bandai Video
[3:07:09.580 --> 3:07:11.580]  radio stations and TV stations across the country.
[3:07:11.580 --> 3:07:12.580]  And our film Endgame,
[3:07:12.580 --> 3:07:14.580]  censored and taken offline by Amazon
[3:07:14.580 --> 3:07:16.580]  when it hit number one a few years ago,
[3:07:16.580 --> 3:07:17.580]  is now available again.
[3:07:17.580 --> 3:07:19.580]  We have reprinted it on high quality DVD.
[3:07:19.580 --> 3:07:21.580]  In HD, it has a zero country code.
[3:07:21.580 --> 3:07:24.580]  Anyone in the world is authorized to make copies of it
[3:07:24.580 --> 3:07:26.580]  and I'm asking you to get the original, make copies,
[3:07:26.580 --> 3:07:27.580]  give it to everyone you know.
[3:07:27.580 --> 3:07:29.580]  Get it on local access TV, give it to your pastors,
[3:07:29.580 --> 3:07:31.580]  your police chiefs, your state reps,
[3:07:31.580 --> 3:07:33.580]  your prime ministers, whatever you do,
[3:07:33.580 --> 3:07:35.580]  warn the world, this film uses their own documents
[3:07:35.580 --> 3:07:38.580]  and those statements 14 years ago to expose them.
[3:07:38.580 --> 3:07:39.580]  It's more important than ever,
[3:07:39.580 --> 3:07:42.580]  available at infowardsstore.com.
[3:07:42.580 --> 3:07:43.580]  That's infowardsstore.com.
[3:07:43.580 --> 3:07:45.580]  Endgame, blueprint for global enslavement.
[3:07:47.580 --> 3:07:50.580]  I don't really need to sell you on how beat concentrate
[3:07:50.580 --> 3:07:52.580]  is really good for your heart, good for your liver,
[3:07:52.580 --> 3:07:54.580]  good for your lungs, good for your cardiovascular system
[3:07:54.580 --> 3:07:55.580]  and your brain.
[3:07:55.580 --> 3:07:58.580]  It's well known and so beat supplements
[3:07:58.580 --> 3:08:00.580]  are amongst the best sellers out there.
[3:08:00.580 --> 3:08:02.580]  So I went out to a top lab and I said,
[3:08:02.580 --> 3:08:04.580]  what is the strongest beat concentrate?
[3:08:04.580 --> 3:08:07.580]  You can do a copy of the popular formula you have.
[3:08:07.580 --> 3:08:09.580]  They explained that their formula had a certain percentage
[3:08:09.580 --> 3:08:12.580]  and I said, just like with body's ultimate turmeric formula,
[3:08:12.580 --> 3:08:15.580]  for the average competitors at five percent per humanoid,
[3:08:15.580 --> 3:08:18.580]  I said, no one else does 95, that's the highest level.
[3:08:18.580 --> 3:08:20.580]  I said, give me 95 percent per humanoid.
[3:08:20.580 --> 3:08:21.580]  Didn't even cost much more.
[3:08:21.580 --> 3:08:23.580]  And we have 95 percent per humanoid.
[3:08:23.580 --> 3:08:25.580]  Well, it's the same thing here.
[3:08:25.580 --> 3:08:27.580]  This is a very strong beat extract
[3:08:27.580 --> 3:08:30.580]  and it's very good for your body, good for your heart
[3:08:30.580 --> 3:08:31.580]  and it's back in stock.
[3:08:31.580 --> 3:08:33.580]  Vaso beats at infowarstore.com.
[3:08:33.580 --> 3:08:35.580]  50 percent off.
[3:08:35.580 --> 3:08:37.580]  Turbo forces back in.
[3:08:37.580 --> 3:08:38.580]  DNA forces back in.
[3:08:38.580 --> 3:08:40.580]  Ultra 12 is back in.
[3:08:40.580 --> 3:08:43.580]  Super metal vitality is back in and they all fund the info war
[3:08:43.580 --> 3:08:44.580]  and they're store-wide free shipping
[3:08:44.580 --> 3:09:10.580]  and double-patria points for the week of Memorial Day.
[3:09:10.580 --> 3:09:13.580]  So we've had the first few days of actual summer here
[3:09:13.580 --> 3:09:15.580]  in the UK over the past few days
[3:09:15.580 --> 3:09:18.580]  and people are out in the beaches, they're out sun tanning,
[3:09:18.580 --> 3:09:20.580]  enjoying themselves, meeting up with friends and family
[3:09:20.580 --> 3:09:22.580]  and we can't be having that, can we?
[3:09:22.580 --> 3:09:23.580]  No.
[3:09:23.580 --> 3:09:26.580]  The sage, the much-vaunted sage government advisers
[3:09:26.580 --> 3:09:28.580]  have come out once again and said,
[3:09:28.580 --> 3:09:30.580]  we're going to have a third wave
[3:09:30.580 --> 3:09:31.580]  or is it a fourth wave?
[3:09:31.580 --> 3:09:33.580]  Who's keeping count at this point?
[3:09:33.580 --> 3:09:37.580]  Terrified that their position on the peanut gallery
[3:09:37.580 --> 3:09:40.580]  will be dislodged for eternity.
[3:09:40.580 --> 3:09:42.580]  Now saying that despite the fact we've had zero deaths
[3:09:42.580 --> 3:09:44.580]  recorded today in the UK,
[3:09:44.580 --> 3:09:49.580]  that we need to keep these restrictions in place.
[3:09:49.580 --> 3:09:51.580]  And I hasten to add, by the way,
[3:09:51.580 --> 3:09:55.580]  as we previously highlighted and as I highlight in this article,
[3:09:55.580 --> 3:09:58.580]  an issue which didn't get much media attention at the time,
[3:09:58.580 --> 3:10:02.580]  there was one report on it out of the telegraph surprise, surprise.
[3:10:02.580 --> 3:10:05.580]  The government advisers, some of the same ones on the sage committee
[3:10:05.580 --> 3:10:07.580]  that has been advising the British government
[3:10:07.580 --> 3:10:10.580]  for the past 15 months on this pandemic,
[3:10:10.580 --> 3:10:12.580]  literally admitted,
[3:10:12.580 --> 3:10:15.580]  we cannot emphasise how important this is enough,
[3:10:15.580 --> 3:10:18.580]  literally admitted that their scare propaganda,
[3:10:18.580 --> 3:10:20.580]  their scare tactics, there,
[3:10:20.580 --> 3:10:23.580]  what they called psychological manipulation
[3:10:23.580 --> 3:10:27.580]  of the British public was too effective,
[3:10:27.580 --> 3:10:30.580]  those are their words, too effective,
[3:10:30.580 --> 3:10:33.580]  and that it terrorised people to such a degree
[3:10:33.580 --> 3:10:35.580]  that again, as I mentioned before,
[3:10:35.580 --> 3:10:37.580]  people have developed a new mental illness called
[3:10:37.580 --> 3:10:40.580]  COVID-19 anxiety disorder,
[3:10:40.580 --> 3:10:42.580]  which is a combination of being a literal jellyfish
[3:10:42.580 --> 3:10:45.580]  with no spine, combined with being afraid to go out,
[3:10:45.580 --> 3:10:47.580]  agrophobia, as it were.
[3:10:47.580 --> 3:10:49.580]  They admitted, again,
[3:10:49.580 --> 3:10:52.580]  that they use psychological manipulation techniques
[3:10:52.580 --> 3:10:55.580]  that were, quote, unethical and, quote, totalitarian,
[3:10:55.580 --> 3:10:57.580]  as methods of instilling fear in the population
[3:10:57.580 --> 3:11:00.580]  in order to control behaviour during the pandemic.
[3:11:00.580 --> 3:11:03.580]  So they overreacted the pudding, that's putting it lightly,
[3:11:03.580 --> 3:11:06.580]  to the point where, as I mentioned,
[3:11:06.580 --> 3:11:08.580]  in a video last week,
[3:11:08.580 --> 3:11:11.580]  some people are so afraid of COVID
[3:11:11.580 --> 3:11:14.580]  that they're still not only wearing their face masks indoors,
[3:11:14.580 --> 3:11:17.580]  they're wearing them during sexual intercourse
[3:11:17.580 --> 3:11:19.580]  with their own partners.
[3:11:19.580 --> 3:11:23.580]  That is the degree of pathological trauma
[3:11:23.580 --> 3:11:25.580]  that this scientific dictatorship
[3:11:25.580 --> 3:11:30.580]  has instilled into the population writ large.
[3:11:30.580 --> 3:11:32.580]  So zero COVID deaths in the UK,
[3:11:32.580 --> 3:11:36.580]  yet still these scientists being given column spaces,
[3:11:36.580 --> 3:11:39.580]  column inches, being given TV platforms
[3:11:39.580 --> 3:11:42.580]  to say, no, despite the fact that nobody's dying,
[3:11:42.580 --> 3:11:44.580]  despite the fact that this is basically over,
[3:11:44.580 --> 3:11:47.580]  we need to lock down again.
[3:11:47.580 --> 3:11:51.580]  Now the raft of headlines to rattle off regarding that issue,
[3:11:51.580 --> 3:11:55.580]  Sputnik News reports Johnson urged to delay lifting of lockdown
[3:11:55.580 --> 3:11:59.580]  over new virus strains to stop mini-COVID volcanoes,
[3:11:59.580 --> 3:12:01.580]  whatever the hell that means.
[3:12:01.580 --> 3:12:04.580]  They've just come up with a new scare-mongering term,
[3:12:04.580 --> 3:12:08.580]  which is mini-COVID volcanoes.
[3:12:08.580 --> 3:12:12.580]  Breitbart reports top Tory corona-obsessed scientists
[3:12:12.580 --> 3:12:16.580]  staging a coordinated effort to extend lockdowns.
[3:12:16.580 --> 3:12:18.580]  Gee, I wonder why they want to do that?
[3:12:18.580 --> 3:12:21.580]  The money, the clout, the attention.
[3:12:21.580 --> 3:12:23.580]  A group of coronavirus-obsessed scientists in Britain
[3:12:23.580 --> 3:12:26.580]  are launching a coordinated effort to derail plans
[3:12:26.580 --> 3:12:29.580]  to fully reopen the country by pushing fears of another wave
[3:12:29.580 --> 3:12:33.580]  of the virus, said formatory leader Ian Duncan Smith.
[3:12:33.580 --> 3:12:35.580]  Prime Minister Boris Johnson has told the nation
[3:12:35.580 --> 3:12:38.580]  that lockdowns would be lifted on June 21st.
[3:12:38.580 --> 3:12:40.580]  However, media reports spurred on by warnings
[3:12:40.580 --> 3:12:44.580]  from select members of the government's SAGE coronavirus
[3:12:44.580 --> 3:12:47.580]  Congo, a third wave, have increasingly suggested
[3:12:47.580 --> 3:12:51.580]  that the Freedom Day will need to be pushed back.
[3:12:51.580 --> 3:12:54.580]  Speaking on talk radio, Sir Ian said that while there may be
[3:12:54.580 --> 3:12:56.580]  legitimate concerns about emerging variants,
[3:12:56.580 --> 3:12:59.580]  he found it quite ridiculous listening to various scientists
[3:12:59.580 --> 3:13:02.580]  go on, and it seems like an organized push by a group
[3:13:02.580 --> 3:13:06.580]  of scientists to stop June 21st.
[3:13:06.580 --> 3:13:08.580]  He said the campaigns have been building up over the past couple
[3:13:08.580 --> 3:13:11.580]  of weeks, saying it looks to him as really coordinated
[3:13:11.580 --> 3:13:13.580]  and quite deliberate.
[3:13:13.580 --> 3:13:16.580]  He noted that while there's been a slight uptick in cases,
[3:13:16.580 --> 3:13:20.580]  the death rate has been static, and indeed today
[3:13:20.580 --> 3:13:22.580]  it's dropped to zero.
[3:13:22.580 --> 3:13:23.580]  They're really mad about that.
[3:13:23.580 --> 3:13:25.580]  They're crying into their cornflakes that nobody's dying
[3:13:25.580 --> 3:13:29.580]  anymore of this virus.
[3:13:29.580 --> 3:13:32.580]  A number of hospitalizations have been flat due to the UK's
[3:13:32.580 --> 3:13:33.580]  vaccination drive.
[3:13:33.580 --> 3:13:35.580]  Well, really, we'll get into that.
[3:13:35.580 --> 3:13:39.580]  He says what we have got now is a bunch of scientists obsessed
[3:13:39.580 --> 3:13:42.580]  with one single issue to the detriment of absolutely
[3:13:42.580 --> 3:13:45.580]  everything else.
[3:13:45.580 --> 3:13:49.580]  Then over in the US, you have this, again, out of Breitbart,
[3:13:49.580 --> 3:13:55.580]  Rona Forever, WHO, and Fauci, warn monumental error to assume
[3:13:55.580 --> 3:13:57.580]  coronavirus danger is over.
[3:13:57.580 --> 3:13:59.580]  They never want it to end.
[3:13:59.580 --> 3:14:03.580]  We could be here in five years' time, and they'll find some
[3:14:03.580 --> 3:14:06.580]  obscure variant, which is still hanging around in the background,
[3:14:06.580 --> 3:14:08.580]  and they'll seize upon that.
[3:14:08.580 --> 3:14:11.580]  Probably they'll just create a new virus, and it'll be
[3:14:11.580 --> 3:14:13.580]  accidentally leaked from a lab, and it'll be even worse,
[3:14:13.580 --> 3:14:18.580]  but we've learned that method so far, haven't we?
[3:14:18.580 --> 3:14:23.580]  So, UPI reports WHO director, General Ted Ross, the guy whose
[3:14:23.580 --> 3:14:26.580]  name is impossible to pronounce, and I'm not even going to attempt
[3:14:26.580 --> 3:14:27.580]  it, you know the guy.
[3:14:27.580 --> 3:14:31.580]  The guy who amplified Chinese state propaganda on January 14,
[3:14:31.580 --> 3:14:34.580]  saying there was no human-to-human transmission of the
[3:14:34.580 --> 3:14:38.580]  coronavirus, the guy who fought weeks after the initial
[3:14:38.580 --> 3:14:41.580]  outbreak of the pandemic said it was racist and bigoted for
[3:14:41.580 --> 3:14:45.580]  countries to close their borders to stop the spread of the
[3:14:45.580 --> 3:14:49.580]  virus, which led literally to mayors or authority figures in
[3:14:49.580 --> 3:14:52.580]  Italy, which was the fulcrum of the first major outbreak in
[3:14:52.580 --> 3:14:55.580]  Europe, literally telling their population to go out on the
[3:14:55.580 --> 3:14:59.580]  street and hug Chinese people so they wouldn't be seen as racist
[3:14:59.580 --> 3:15:03.580]  because being called racist is worse than dying from a virus.
[3:15:03.580 --> 3:15:06.580]  That guy, speaking at the World Health Assembly, cautioned
[3:15:06.580 --> 3:15:09.580]  against a, quote, monumental error to presume the danger of
[3:15:09.580 --> 3:15:10.580]  coronavirus is over.
[3:15:10.580 --> 3:15:13.580]  The White House chief medical advisor, Dr Anthony Fauci, joined
[3:15:13.580 --> 3:15:17.580]  him to declare the world can't declare victory prematurely
[3:15:17.580 --> 3:15:20.580]  because they don't want to declare victory because it's the
[3:15:20.580 --> 3:15:22.580]  end of their power.
[3:15:22.580 --> 3:15:26.580]  Monopoly, it's the end of their medical scientific dictatorship.
[3:15:26.580 --> 3:15:29.580]  Fauci's warning against any relaxation reprises a
[3:15:29.580 --> 3:15:32.580]  declaration he made in April for the public to get vaccinated
[3:15:32.580 --> 3:15:34.580]  and continue wearing masks.
[3:15:34.580 --> 3:15:39.580]  So you have that happening between the WHO and Fauci.
[3:15:39.580 --> 3:15:43.580]  Meanwhile, BBC continues to insist employees wear social
[3:15:43.580 --> 3:15:45.580]  distancing tags despite complaints.
[3:15:45.580 --> 3:15:49.580]  So basically they forced them back in January to wear these
[3:15:49.580 --> 3:15:54.580]  proximity sensors, which give off a loud annoying beep whenever
[3:15:54.580 --> 3:15:58.580]  BBC employees within the newsroom get within two meters of
[3:15:58.580 --> 3:16:03.580]  anyone else to, quote, help maintain social distancing.
[3:16:03.580 --> 3:16:08.580]  Turns out these electronic tags have literally been exploding
[3:16:08.580 --> 3:16:10.580]  and smoking.
[3:16:10.580 --> 3:16:13.580]  And yet the BBC came out and said, doesn't matter, we're
[3:16:13.580 --> 3:16:16.580]  going to continue to force you to wear them anyway.
[3:16:16.580 --> 3:16:19.580]  One of the tags had to be retired from use after it started
[3:16:19.580 --> 3:16:22.580]  smoking with an employee telling the Guardian, quote, if they
[3:16:22.580 --> 3:16:26.580]  can't handle daily use and start setting on fire or overheating
[3:16:26.580 --> 3:16:28.580]  then they shouldn't be here.
[3:16:28.580 --> 3:16:31.580]  Another employee said the beeping sensors were a nightmare in
[3:16:31.580 --> 3:16:34.580]  a working environment where absolute silence is often
[3:16:34.580 --> 3:16:39.580]  required. So they're literally forcing them to wear these slave
[3:16:39.580 --> 3:16:44.580]  cattle tags that beep while they're in a newsroom.
[3:16:44.580 --> 3:16:48.580]  As the guys running the show will know right now, silence is
[3:16:48.580 --> 3:16:51.580]  quite an important thing when you're running a newsroom and
[3:16:51.580 --> 3:16:53.580]  trying to do a live broadcast.
[3:16:53.580 --> 3:16:56.580]  So they keep beeping, they keep being set off, in some cases
[3:16:56.580 --> 3:16:58.580]  overheating, catching on fire.
[3:16:58.580 --> 3:17:03.580]  And yet the BBC came out and said, quote, we are surprised that
[3:17:03.580 --> 3:17:05.580]  a problem with the single electronic device is a news
[3:17:05.580 --> 3:17:08.580]  story, especially as devices that are being used where social
[3:17:08.580 --> 3:17:12.580]  distancing is challenging and they're about safety.
[3:17:12.580 --> 3:17:17.580]  Now I referred back in this article to two different articles
[3:17:17.580 --> 3:17:21.580]  from both the British and the Australian government who
[3:17:21.580 --> 3:17:26.580]  previously seriously considered forcing British citizens,
[3:17:26.580 --> 3:17:30.580]  Australian citizens to wear electronic ankle bracelets like
[3:17:30.580 --> 3:17:33.580]  prisoners to ensure they're complying with home quarantine
[3:17:33.580 --> 3:17:37.580]  orders, literally considered, and maybe it's in the offering
[3:17:37.580 --> 3:17:41.580]  for the future, forcing people to wear prisoner style tags to
[3:17:41.580 --> 3:17:45.580]  make sure they're complying their behaving themselves.
[3:17:45.580 --> 3:17:46.580]  Put it back.
[3:17:46.580 --> 3:17:47.580]  Some of it don't use the gold.
[3:17:47.580 --> 3:17:49.580]  You know, the listeners call into the show when they thank me
[3:17:49.580 --> 3:17:53.580]  and it makes me feel pathetic because I sit there and I beg
[3:17:53.580 --> 3:17:57.580]  you for support constantly, for prayer, for financial support,
[3:17:57.580 --> 3:18:00.580]  for word of mouth, and we're all in this together.
[3:18:00.580 --> 3:18:03.580]  And you know, it gets old having to come to you and say, hey,
[3:18:03.580 --> 3:18:05.580]  I've got great products, please buy them or we won't be here
[3:18:05.580 --> 3:18:06.580]  on air.
[3:18:06.580 --> 3:18:07.580]  But it's true.
[3:18:07.580 --> 3:18:09.580]  We're the only media organization in the United States that
[3:18:09.580 --> 3:18:12.580]  promotes liberty at this level that is not beholden to big
[3:18:12.580 --> 3:18:13.580]  corporate sponsors.
[3:18:13.580 --> 3:18:15.580]  And they've harassed and almost shut down everybody else.
[3:18:15.580 --> 3:18:17.580]  They crippled all the other groups.
[3:18:17.580 --> 3:18:18.580]  And we're still here.
[3:18:18.580 --> 3:18:21.580]  And as this whole new world order comes out and be open,
[3:18:21.580 --> 3:18:22.580]  our credibility is going up.
[3:18:22.580 --> 3:18:24.580]  That's why we've got to be taken off air.
[3:18:24.580 --> 3:18:26.580]  That's why America has got to be taken down.
[3:18:26.580 --> 3:18:28.580]  You can't have all these other nations enslaved.
[3:18:28.580 --> 3:18:30.580]  And America is still quasi-free.
[3:18:30.580 --> 3:18:33.580]  You can't have info wars has been proven right being on air
[3:18:33.580 --> 3:18:35.580]  with all the craziness that's about to unfold.
[3:18:35.580 --> 3:18:38.580]  Because if you think stuff's bad now, just get ready.
[3:18:38.580 --> 3:18:39.580]  So thank you all.
[3:18:39.580 --> 3:18:40.580]  And get an infowarstore.com.
[3:18:40.580 --> 3:18:42.580]  Get some great 2020 election shirts.
[3:18:42.580 --> 3:18:44.580]  Supplements and so much more.
[3:18:44.580 --> 3:18:45.580]  They're wonderful products.
[3:18:45.580 --> 3:18:46.580]  And they support the info.
[3:18:46.580 --> 3:18:47.580]  We're thanking you.
[3:18:47.580 --> 3:18:49.580]  You know, I'm cutting an ad right now.
[3:18:49.580 --> 3:18:51.580]  And I've been here on the Saturday cutting days.
[3:18:51.580 --> 3:18:55.580]  I'm doing a terrible job because I just cut like five ads.
[3:18:55.580 --> 3:18:58.580]  And I didn't tell people the most important part.
[3:18:58.580 --> 3:18:59.580]  No.
[3:18:59.580 --> 3:19:03.580]  It's not that DNA Force Plus has been sold out for seven months
[3:19:03.580 --> 3:19:05.580]  and is back in stock and is 40% off.
[3:19:05.580 --> 3:19:07.580]  Or how the supply chain broke down
[3:19:07.580 --> 3:19:08.580]  and how it almost bankrupted us.
[3:19:08.580 --> 3:19:10.580]  But thank God it finally came in.
[3:19:10.580 --> 3:19:12.580]  Or how it cleans up your mitochondria
[3:19:12.580 --> 3:19:14.580]  and makes your telomeres last longer
[3:19:14.580 --> 3:19:15.580]  and can regrow nerves.
[3:19:15.580 --> 3:19:17.580]  You've got to go research DNA Force Plus.
[3:19:17.580 --> 3:19:18.580]  No, it's not that.
[3:19:18.580 --> 3:19:20.580]  The reason I just cut all those ads
[3:19:20.580 --> 3:19:22.580]  and forgot the most important point.
[3:19:22.580 --> 3:19:25.580]  The Superdoll Vitality is back in stock.

[3:19:40.580 --> 3:19:41.580]  No.
[3:19:41.580 --> 3:19:42.580]  It's dead.
[3:19:42.580 --> 3:19:43.580]  We've got double Patreon points
[3:19:43.580 --> 3:19:44.580]  and free shipping store wide.
[3:19:44.580 --> 3:19:45.580]  Double Patreon points.

[3:19:47.580 --> 3:19:49.580]  I've got some really good news
[3:19:49.580 --> 3:19:51.580]  for the viewers and listeners of this broadcast.
[3:19:51.580 --> 3:19:53.580]  And then I've got some really, really, really,
[3:19:53.580 --> 3:19:55.580]  really, really good news.
[3:19:55.580 --> 3:19:57.580]  Yes, I could spend an hour telling you about
[3:19:57.580 --> 3:19:58.580]  how the Globals are going to expose
[3:19:58.580 --> 3:20:01.580]  and how they launch COVID-19 as a bio weapon
[3:20:01.580 --> 3:20:03.580]  and how much trouble Bill Gates and Fauci are in.
[3:20:03.580 --> 3:20:05.580]  I can even tell you about how the states are turning
[3:20:05.580 --> 3:20:07.580]  against the public president Biden
[3:20:07.580 --> 3:20:09.580]  and saying we're going to have $1,000 fine
[3:20:09.580 --> 3:20:10.580]  to try to make people wear masks.
[3:20:10.580 --> 3:20:12.580]  I could tell you about all of that,
[3:20:12.580 --> 3:20:14.580]  but why shouldn't I instead tell you
[3:20:14.580 --> 3:20:17.580]  about the super good news concerning the info war?
[3:20:17.580 --> 3:20:18.580]  That's right, ladies and gentlemen.
[3:20:18.580 --> 3:20:20.580]  We are running right now,
[3:20:20.580 --> 3:20:23.580]  a real day special for the next week only

[3:20:49.580 --> 3:20:51.580]  to tell you how amazing Pollen Block is,
[3:20:51.580 --> 3:20:53.580]  but you should go to infowarstore.com
[3:20:53.580 --> 3:20:55.580]  and read the third party review sites

[3:20:57.580 --> 3:20:59.580]  and people love it.
[3:20:59.580 --> 3:21:02.580]  Pollen Block is a proprietary formula from France
[3:21:02.580 --> 3:21:05.580]  where they just learned by happenstance
[3:21:05.580 --> 3:21:08.580]  that quail that eat a certain diet
[3:21:08.580 --> 3:21:10.580]  produce eggs and eggshells
[3:21:10.580 --> 3:21:12.580]  that are amazing when people eat them
[3:21:12.580 --> 3:21:14.580]  for knocking out seasonal discomfort
[3:21:14.580 --> 3:21:16.580]  or what folks call allergies.

[3:21:46.580 --> 3:21:48.580]  This stuff really, really works.
[3:21:48.580 --> 3:21:51.580]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[3:22:01.580 --> 3:22:03.580]  Live from London, England,
[3:22:03.580 --> 3:22:07.580]  it's Paul Joseph Watson with Summit.News.
[3:22:12.580 --> 3:22:14.580]  We're going to go to this video now,
[3:22:14.580 --> 3:22:16.580]  which went up a couple of hours ago
[3:22:16.580 --> 3:22:18.580]  called Why You Should Boo Take A Knee.
[3:22:18.580 --> 3:22:21.580]  We have the European Football Championships coming up
[3:22:21.580 --> 3:22:24.580]  across Europe a week on Friday,
[3:22:24.580 --> 3:22:27.580]  where fans are graciously allowed back into the stadiums
[3:22:27.580 --> 3:22:30.580]  and they have the opportunity to express their free speech,
[3:22:30.580 --> 3:22:33.580]  their personal opinion on Take A Knee,
[3:22:33.580 --> 3:22:35.580]  what it actually represents,
[3:22:35.580 --> 3:22:37.580]  and that is what this video is about.
[3:22:37.580 --> 3:22:39.580]  We're going to go to it now, come back, talk about it.
[3:22:39.580 --> 3:22:47.580]  Here is the video.
[3:22:47.580 --> 3:22:49.580]  Chelsea fans at the Champions League final
[3:22:49.580 --> 3:22:51.580]  audibly booed before the start of the game
[3:22:51.580 --> 3:22:53.580]  as players took the knee.
[3:22:56.580 --> 3:22:58.580]  You want to reconnect?
[3:23:01.580 --> 3:23:03.580]  Hello, Base Department.
[3:23:03.580 --> 3:23:06.580]  So now race grifters across the board are paranoid
[3:23:06.580 --> 3:23:09.580]  that that will be replicated when fans are allowed
[3:23:09.580 --> 3:23:12.580]  to fill stadiums again from next season onwards.
[3:23:12.580 --> 3:23:14.580]  What's the FA's stance on this?
[3:23:14.580 --> 3:23:16.580]  So our stance on this is it is absolutely
[3:23:16.580 --> 3:23:18.580]  a personal choice for players.
[3:23:18.580 --> 3:23:21.580]  FA equality diversity and inclusion director.
[3:23:23.580 --> 3:23:25.580]  Let's be clear on what taking the knee is.
[3:23:25.580 --> 3:23:28.580]  Taking the knee is players protesting against inequality,
[3:23:28.580 --> 3:23:31.580]  injustice and discrimination across the game.
[3:23:31.580 --> 3:23:34.580]  No, it's not. UK football players began to take a knee
[3:23:34.580 --> 3:23:37.580]  in June 2020, specifically in response
[3:23:37.580 --> 3:23:40.580]  to Black Lives Matter's global white guilt trip,
[3:23:40.580 --> 3:23:42.580]  which began in June 2020.
[3:23:42.580 --> 3:23:44.580]  The players literally wore the words
[3:23:44.580 --> 3:23:46.580]  Black Lives Matter on the back of their shirts
[3:23:46.580 --> 3:23:48.580]  for weeks on end.
[3:23:48.580 --> 3:23:50.580]  Sky Sports literally still to this day
[3:23:50.580 --> 3:23:52.580]  flashes up the message Black Lives Matter
[3:23:52.580 --> 3:23:55.580]  during every game it broadcasts.
[3:23:55.580 --> 3:23:57.580]  Stadiums are festooned with giant flags
[3:23:57.580 --> 3:23:59.580]  that say Black Lives Matter.
[3:23:59.580 --> 3:24:02.580]  Correct me if I'm wrong, but that kind of suggests to me
[3:24:02.580 --> 3:24:05.580]  that this is about a group called Black Lives Matter.
[3:24:05.580 --> 3:24:08.580]  Arguing otherwise is like claiming that C. Kyling
[3:24:08.580 --> 3:24:10.580]  has nothing to do with the Nazis.
[3:24:10.580 --> 3:24:13.580]  So no, it's not just some vague message about inequality.
[3:24:13.580 --> 3:24:16.580]  Because modern football is so riddled with inequality,
[3:24:16.580 --> 3:24:18.580]  the lack of diversity is atrocious.
[3:24:18.580 --> 3:24:20.580]  It isn't aligned to a political party.
[3:24:20.580 --> 3:24:23.580]  It's about signalling support for Black Lives Matter,
[3:24:23.580 --> 3:24:25.580]  the political group.
[3:24:25.580 --> 3:24:28.580]  You know, the group that desecrates statues and memorials.
[3:24:28.580 --> 3:24:30.580]  The group that burns down cities
[3:24:30.580 --> 3:24:32.580]  in muscly peaceful demonstrations.
[3:24:32.580 --> 3:24:34.580]  The group that routinely intimidates and harasses people
[3:24:34.580 --> 3:24:36.580]  at restaurants if they refuse to support their cult.
[3:24:36.580 --> 3:24:38.580]  The group that openly espouses its agenda
[3:24:38.580 --> 3:24:40.580]  to destroy the family.
[3:24:40.580 --> 3:24:42.580]  The group whose founders say their spiritual guru
[3:24:42.580 --> 3:24:45.580]  is a convicted cop killer fugitive terrorist.
[3:24:45.580 --> 3:24:48.580]  The group whose followers have literally carried out
[3:24:48.580 --> 3:24:50.580]  mass shootings.
[3:24:50.580 --> 3:24:52.580]  So much for the tolerant left.
[3:24:52.580 --> 3:24:54.580]  Point is, this has always been about
[3:24:54.580 --> 3:24:56.580]  Black Lives Matter, uppercase.
[3:24:56.580 --> 3:24:59.580]  A violent far left extremist.
[3:24:59.580 --> 3:25:00.580]  Political group.
[3:25:00.580 --> 3:25:02.580]  When you're booing players who are taking the knee,
[3:25:02.580 --> 3:25:05.580]  what you are in effect booing is the right of those individuals
[3:25:05.580 --> 3:25:07.580]  on that pitch to have a voice
[3:25:07.580 --> 3:25:09.580]  and to protest against inequality.
[3:25:09.580 --> 3:25:11.580]  So why can't fans have a voice too?
[3:25:11.580 --> 3:25:14.580]  If players want to support BLM, fair enough,
[3:25:14.580 --> 3:25:17.580]  let them express their opinion by taking the knee.
[3:25:17.580 --> 3:25:19.580]  They can have their free speech.
[3:25:19.580 --> 3:25:21.580]  So why can't fans?
[3:25:21.580 --> 3:25:24.580]  Why can't the fans who shell out huge chunks of their income
[3:25:24.580 --> 3:25:28.580]  to fund the lavish lifestyles of these pampered, privileged multi-millionaires
[3:25:28.580 --> 3:25:30.580]  express their opinion too?
[3:25:30.580 --> 3:25:33.580]  The same fans, by the way, who have never booed
[3:25:33.580 --> 3:25:36.580]  and have generously supported the Kick It Out campaign
[3:25:36.580 --> 3:25:38.580]  for decades.
[3:25:38.580 --> 3:25:41.580]  We just had a giant European Super League scandal
[3:25:41.580 --> 3:25:44.580]  where the takeaway message, the consensus
[3:25:44.580 --> 3:25:48.580]  from every football pundit, media outlet and news commentator
[3:25:48.580 --> 3:25:51.580]  was listen to the fans.
[3:25:51.580 --> 3:25:53.580]  Listen to the fans.
[3:25:53.580 --> 3:25:56.580]  So listening to the fans is the most important thing
[3:25:56.580 --> 3:25:58.580]  in the world of football.
[3:25:58.580 --> 3:26:00.580]  Yet as soon as some of them express an opinion
[3:26:00.580 --> 3:26:02.580]  that challenges the omnipresent mandated
[3:26:02.580 --> 3:26:05.580]  bleeding subservience to Black Lives Matter,
[3:26:05.580 --> 3:26:08.580]  as soon as some of them refuse to bow down and grovel
[3:26:08.580 --> 3:26:11.580]  to this onerous, sanctimonious, woke monoculture.
[3:26:11.580 --> 3:26:14.580]  Oh, now, suddenly, not only do we not listen to them,
[3:26:14.580 --> 3:26:18.580]  we kick them out of games, we demand they take reeducation classes
[3:26:18.580 --> 3:26:21.580]  and we give them lifetime stadium bands.
[3:26:21.580 --> 3:26:23.580]  Oh, listen to the fans, though.
[3:26:23.580 --> 3:26:25.580]  Who's listening to them now?
[3:26:25.580 --> 3:26:28.580]  Some players from QPR, Wigan Athletic and Middlesbrough
[3:26:28.580 --> 3:26:31.580]  all tried to exercise their choice,
[3:26:31.580 --> 3:26:34.580]  their freedom of expression to stop taking the knee.
[3:26:34.580 --> 3:26:36.580]  And what happened?
[3:26:36.580 --> 3:26:39.580]  They were pressured and dragooned back into doing it.
[3:26:39.580 --> 3:26:42.580]  That doesn't sound like supporting free expression to me.
[3:26:42.580 --> 3:26:45.580]  That sounds like intimidation through the threat
[3:26:45.580 --> 3:26:48.580]  of social media mobs and official sanctions
[3:26:48.580 --> 3:26:53.580]  into endorsing a dogmatically totalitarian political movement.
[3:26:53.580 --> 3:26:55.580]  Taking a knee is an action that is respectful.
[3:26:55.580 --> 3:26:58.580]  It enables us to continue to have conversations
[3:26:58.580 --> 3:27:01.580]  about inequality, about discrimination, about racism.
[3:27:01.580 --> 3:27:04.580]  Yeah, because we don't talk about racism enough, do we?
[3:27:04.580 --> 3:27:06.580]  It's not like it's rammed down our throats
[3:27:06.580 --> 3:27:08.580]  by every corporation, government entity,
[3:27:08.580 --> 3:27:10.580]  cultural institution, social media network,
[3:27:10.580 --> 3:27:14.580]  and media outlet on a second-by-second basis, is it?
[3:27:14.580 --> 3:27:17.580]  Anyone who has a problem in players taking the knee is a racist.
[3:27:17.580 --> 3:27:18.580]  Simple as that.
[3:27:18.580 --> 3:27:21.580]  How can you oppose a peaceful protest against inequality?
[3:27:21.580 --> 3:27:23.580]  First of all, calling Black Lives Matter peaceful
[3:27:23.580 --> 3:27:26.580]  is like calling Ted Bundy an ardent feminist.
[3:27:26.580 --> 3:27:28.580]  Second of all, who are you calling racist?
[3:27:28.580 --> 3:27:32.580]  Millwall fans were amongst the first to boo taking the knee.
[3:27:32.580 --> 3:27:36.580]  No sooner had they knelt than it began.
[3:27:36.580 --> 3:27:39.580]  Hello, based department, and they're so racist
[3:27:39.580 --> 3:27:42.580]  that they awarded this dude, Najeem Abdu,
[3:27:42.580 --> 3:27:45.580]  Player of the Year, twice.
[3:27:45.580 --> 3:27:47.580]  Yeah, pretty shit racist, aren't they?
[3:27:47.580 --> 3:27:49.580]  If you want to know what these fans actually think.
[3:27:49.580 --> 3:27:51.580]  How about, oh, I don't know,
[3:27:51.580 --> 3:27:53.580]  reading what they actually have to say?
[3:27:53.580 --> 3:27:56.580]  This is a post from a Millwall supporter on a fan's forum.
[3:27:56.580 --> 3:27:58.580]  The whole BLM movement is insulting to many
[3:27:58.580 --> 3:28:01.580]  because it seeks to destroy our country's values.
[3:28:01.580 --> 3:28:03.580]  I don't mean nationalism or jingoism,
[3:28:03.580 --> 3:28:06.580]  but the values that unite people across the political spectrum
[3:28:06.580 --> 3:28:08.580]  are belief in the rule of law, free speech,
[3:28:08.580 --> 3:28:10.580]  respect for others, and the social justice
[3:28:10.580 --> 3:28:12.580]  that many of our forebearers had to fight for
[3:28:12.580 --> 3:28:14.580]  in the trade union movement.
[3:28:14.580 --> 3:28:16.580]  Your excuse for supporting this movement
[3:28:16.580 --> 3:28:17.580]  is an insult to our intelligence
[3:28:17.580 --> 3:28:19.580]  and an overtly political statement.
[3:28:19.580 --> 3:28:21.580]  It's particularly damaging at this time
[3:28:21.580 --> 3:28:23.580]  when so many fans are suffering financial hardship
[3:28:23.580 --> 3:28:26.580]  that you couldn't even begin to understand.
[3:28:26.580 --> 3:28:29.580]  By supporting BLM, you're not healing divisions,
[3:28:29.580 --> 3:28:30.580]  but creating them.
[3:28:30.580 --> 3:28:32.580]  I fear that your actions will cause
[3:28:32.580 --> 3:28:34.580]  not just the division between players and fans,
[3:28:34.580 --> 3:28:37.580]  but a gulf of betrayal that will never be bridged.
[3:28:37.580 --> 3:28:39.580]  If you want to campaign against discrimination,
[3:28:39.580 --> 3:28:42.580]  then please do so, but supporting BLM
[3:28:42.580 --> 3:28:44.580]  is the wrong way to do it.
[3:28:44.580 --> 3:28:47.580]  It's easier to just dismiss them as racist though, right?
[3:28:47.580 --> 3:28:49.580]  Black footballers like Wilfrid Zahar
[3:28:49.580 --> 3:28:51.580]  have also asked this question.
[3:28:51.580 --> 3:28:53.580]  What does any of it achieve anyway?
[3:28:53.580 --> 3:28:55.580]  During the whole of 2019,
[3:28:55.580 --> 3:28:58.580]  UK police killed just one black person,
[3:28:58.580 --> 3:29:00.580]  and he was a terrorist.
[3:29:00.580 --> 3:29:03.580]  The UK sports media constantly whips up moral panics
[3:29:03.580 --> 3:29:06.580]  about racist comments sent to players on social media.
[3:29:06.580 --> 3:29:09.580]  So the media conglomerates and their stooges that own them
[3:29:09.580 --> 3:29:12.580]  can then lobby for more social media censorship.
[3:29:12.580 --> 3:29:14.580]  Then time and time again,
[3:29:14.580 --> 3:29:16.580]  you look at the accounts sending these racist messages,
[3:29:16.580 --> 3:29:20.580]  and 99% of the time it's Abdull, or Ibrahim.
[3:29:20.580 --> 3:29:24.580]  99% of the time they're from Dubai, Morocco, or Egypt.
[3:29:24.580 --> 3:29:27.580]  It kind of suggests to me that the UK isn't the problem.
[3:29:27.580 --> 3:29:31.580]  In the US, BLM raked in $70 million last year.
[3:29:31.580 --> 3:29:33.580]  And where did that go?
[3:29:33.580 --> 3:29:35.580]  Well, we know where some of it went,
[3:29:35.580 --> 3:29:37.580]  straight into the bank account of BLM co-founder,
[3:29:37.580 --> 3:29:41.580]  Patrice Calors, so she could buy multiple mansions.
[3:29:41.580 --> 3:29:43.580]  What about the rest?
[3:29:43.580 --> 3:29:46.580]  To bail out violent criminals who rampage through cities,
[3:29:46.580 --> 3:29:49.580]  attacking people, and burning down small businesses.
[3:29:49.580 --> 3:29:52.580]  So when the stadiums are packed with fans once again,
[3:29:52.580 --> 3:29:54.580]  not only should they not be punished
[3:29:54.580 --> 3:29:56.580]  for booing the taking of the knee,
[3:29:56.580 --> 3:29:59.580]  they should be openly encouraged to do so.
[3:29:59.580 --> 3:30:02.580]  Black Lives Matter is a hateful, divisive, violent,
[3:30:02.580 --> 3:30:05.580]  extremist organization that has achieved nothing
[3:30:05.580 --> 3:30:08.580]  apart from worsening race relations
[3:30:08.580 --> 3:30:12.580]  and lining the pockets of its grifter, race-baiting leaders.
[3:30:12.580 --> 3:30:15.580]  So please, if you're planning to attend a game at the Euros,
[3:30:15.580 --> 3:30:18.580]  or when you return to watch your own club next season,
[3:30:18.580 --> 3:30:21.580]  do exactly what some Chelsea fans did this past weekend
[3:30:21.580 --> 3:30:23.580]  when the players took the knee.
[3:30:23.580 --> 3:30:25.580]  Boo and heckle to your heart's content.
[3:30:25.580 --> 3:30:28.580]  It's a commendable act of righteous dissent,
[3:30:28.580 --> 3:30:30.580]  not only against BLM, an organization
[3:30:30.580 --> 3:30:32.580]  that's making the world immeasurably worse
[3:30:32.580 --> 3:30:34.580]  for both black and white people,
[3:30:34.580 --> 3:30:36.580]  but also a giant middle finger
[3:30:36.580 --> 3:30:38.580]  against the malevolent establishment
[3:30:38.580 --> 3:30:42.580]  that has facilitated the growth of their cancerous influence.
[3:30:47.580 --> 3:30:49.580]  As far as I made the point in that video,
[3:30:49.580 --> 3:30:52.580]  Black Lives Matter once again does not care about black people.
[3:30:52.580 --> 3:30:55.580]  We had dozens of people shot over the Memorial Day weekend
[3:30:55.580 --> 3:30:58.580]  in Chicago, mainly by black criminals,
[3:30:58.580 --> 3:31:01.580]  the victims also black people, nobody cares about that.
[3:31:01.580 --> 3:31:04.580]  Not just me saying that, we had this headline a couple of days ago,
[3:31:04.580 --> 3:31:07.580]  founder of Black Lives Matter chapter quits,
[3:31:07.580 --> 3:31:10.580]  says BLM doesn't actually care about black people.
[3:31:10.580 --> 3:31:12.580]  This is Rashad Turner,
[3:31:12.580 --> 3:31:14.580]  who released a video revealing the truth about BLM
[3:31:14.580 --> 3:31:18.580]  after having spent a year inside the organization.
[3:31:18.580 --> 3:31:20.580]  Don't forget the guy that blew the whistle
[3:31:20.580 --> 3:31:24.580]  who tried to start an investigation into Pope Therese Clause,
[3:31:24.580 --> 3:31:26.580]  spending millions of dollars on mansions
[3:31:26.580 --> 3:31:29.580]  in predominantly white areas of California.
[3:31:29.580 --> 3:31:30.580]  What happened to him?
[3:31:30.580 --> 3:31:35.580]  He was targeted by BLM for elimination from the organization.
[3:31:35.580 --> 3:31:37.580]  So the people who actually blew the whistle
[3:31:37.580 --> 3:31:39.580]  on the true corruption within that organization
[3:31:39.580 --> 3:31:41.580]  are immediately ostracized.
[3:31:41.580 --> 3:31:43.580]  We'll be back to talk about it on the other side.
[3:31:43.580 --> 3:32:12.580]  Summit.News, don't go away.
[3:32:13.580 --> 3:32:41.580]  We'll be back.
[3:32:41.580 --> 3:32:46.580]  We'll be back.
[3:33:11.580 --> 3:33:36.580]  We'll be back.
[3:33:36.580 --> 3:33:46.580]  We'll be back.
[3:34:06.580 --> 3:34:33.580]  We'll be back.
[3:34:33.580 --> 3:34:47.580]  We'll be back.
[3:35:03.580 --> 3:35:22.580]  We'll be back.
[3:35:22.580 --> 3:35:47.580]  We'll be back.
[3:35:47.580 --> 3:36:09.580]  We'll be back.
[3:36:09.580 --> 3:36:35.580]  We'll be back.
[3:36:35.580 --> 3:37:01.580]  We'll be back.
[3:37:01.580 --> 3:37:27.580]  We'll be back.
[3:37:27.580 --> 3:37:53.580]  We'll be back.
[3:37:53.580 --> 3:38:19.580]  We'll be back.
[3:38:19.580 --> 3:38:45.580]  We'll be back.
[3:38:45.580 --> 3:39:07.580]  We'll be back.
[3:39:07.580 --> 3:39:33.580]  We'll be back.
[3:39:33.580 --> 3:39:55.580]  We'll be back.
[3:39:55.580 --> 3:40:21.580]  We'll be back.
[3:40:21.580 --> 3:40:47.580]  We'll be back.
[3:40:47.580 --> 3:41:13.580]  We'll be back.
[3:41:13.580 --> 3:41:39.580]  We'll be back.
[3:41:39.580 --> 3:42:01.580]  We'll be back.
[3:42:01.580 --> 3:42:23.580]  We'll be back.
[3:42:23.580 --> 3:42:49.580]  We'll be back.
[3:42:49.580 --> 3:43:01.580]  This is a New York Times reporter who specializes, that's in her own bio in COVID-19 coverage, tweeted that it was racist to even talk about the Wuhan lab leak theory.
[3:43:01.580 --> 3:43:13.580]  The New York Times itself also reported yesterday that the US intelligence community has been sitting on a raft of evidence pertaining to the Wuhan Institute of Virology, but that did not stop.
[3:43:13.580 --> 3:43:19.580]  It was somebody whose name I still cannot pronounce, just as with the WHO director.
[3:43:19.580 --> 3:43:33.580]  I'll have to go, a pauver Mandevili, that's probably close enough, who in her bio says she reports for the New York Times, quote, mainly on COVID asserted in a tweet that even discussing the issue was racist.
[3:43:33.580 --> 3:43:52.580]  To talk about the fact that this virus emerged literally hundreds of meters from the Weapons Research Institute, where they were literally conducting these experiments with COVID and animals, even to discuss that in May 2021 and now June 2021 is still racist.
[3:43:52.580 --> 3:44:12.580]  Now, that may seem like a clown world hilarious joke. It's not a joke, because as we know, countries in the West across the board imposed border control policies or didn't fail to impose border control policies based on the emergence of this pandemic, because they were in fear that they would be called racist.
[3:44:12.580 --> 3:44:22.580]  And we had another headline regarding that subject a few days ago. Here in the UK, Boris Johnson refused to close borders to stop COVID because he thought it would be racist.
[3:44:22.580 --> 3:44:33.580]  According to his former chief advisor, Dominic Cummings, to stop the spread of coronavirus would be racist because Chinese people may get offended.
[3:44:33.580 --> 3:44:53.580]  It would be bigoted and that as we know from when we were reported on it at the time was coming directly from the World Health Organization itself, where they literally put our advisories to governments across the West, who followed it to the T, saying that to impose border controls back in February would cause
[3:44:53.580 --> 3:45:02.580]  stigmatization against Chinese people and it would lead to a wave of hate crime against Chinese people now.
[3:45:02.580 --> 3:45:14.580]  There was a wave of hate crime against Chinese people over the last year. It wasn't caused by people saying that the virus emerged out of China. It was caused by something else.
[3:45:14.580 --> 3:45:22.580]  We have this headline of RT black homeless man charged with hate crime after assaulting Asian woman in New York attack.
[3:45:22.580 --> 3:45:34.580]  The 48 year old Alexander right black homeless man from New York was arrested and charged with committing a hate crime after a video showed him spontaneously assaulting an Asian woman in Chinatown on Monday.
[3:45:34.580 --> 3:45:44.580]  Now, if you followed this broadcast, you will know there are literally examples of this videos of this footage of this on a daily basis. And yet we have this narrative.
[3:45:44.580 --> 3:46:00.580]  The last six months, it's kind of stopped now hasn't it as very interesting with the hashtag stop Asian hate and they tried to link it to this imaginary white supremacist takeover movement that doesn't exist.
[3:46:00.580 --> 3:46:16.580]  I think that that was what fostered the massive and I think it's 600% increase over the past year in hate crimes violent attacks targeting Chinese people targeting Asian people in major metropolitan cities in America.
[3:46:16.580 --> 3:46:29.580]  Turns out if you watch the videos and if you watch this video in particular once again, it's not white supremacy strikes again. It's criminal populations in New York in these major cities, which continue to be a big problem.
[3:46:29.580 --> 3:46:33.580]  It's going to wrap it up. War Room is coming up next with Owen Shroyer. Don't go away.
