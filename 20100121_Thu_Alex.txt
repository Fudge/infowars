[00:00.000 --> 00:14.120]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he he's Alex Jones
[00:14.120 --> 00:34.300]  on the GCN Radio Network and now live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones. For the last three hours
[00:34.300 --> 00:44.420]  Secretary of the Treasury little Timmy Geithner is being grilled concerning all of his criminal
[00:44.420 --> 00:51.540]  activity giving himself and his former boss, the former head of Goldman Sachs and the former
[00:51.540 --> 00:59.880]  head of the Treasury, Henry Paulson billions and billions of dollars and ordering AIG the
[00:59.880 --> 01:05.340]  holding company they use for the scam not to tell the federal government or the public
[01:05.340 --> 01:11.820]  or the stockholders what had happened. He's being grilled we've got some of the transcript
[01:11.820 --> 01:17.020]  of the serious questions that have been brought up to this individual and Paulson's also set
[01:17.020 --> 01:25.020]  to testify later today. Other branches of the Congress want to interview him next week
[01:25.020 --> 01:36.220]  we're going to be breaking that down today. Obviously I want to talk more about Mr. Brown
[01:36.220 --> 01:43.660]  winning in Massachusetts yesterday on the one year anniversary of Obama's first year
[01:43.660 --> 01:52.460]  in office isn't that apropos and again it doesn't matter if Mr. Brown is a rhino because
[01:52.460 --> 01:58.820]  this vote was a message to the government that we don't want big government we don't
[01:58.820 --> 02:04.060]  want to be looted by the insurance companies we don't want to go to prison and pay half
[02:04.060 --> 02:13.780]  million dollar fines if we don't have insurance we don't want the agenda that's being pushed
[02:13.780 --> 02:24.340]  the problem is the Republicans pushed almost the exact same agenda under George W. Bush
[02:24.340 --> 02:28.260]  many Republicans like Newt Gendrich and others have been some of the biggest supporters of
[02:28.260 --> 02:34.980]  the global greenhouse tax greenhouse gas tax Glenn Beck and others are calling for new
[02:34.980 --> 02:44.660]  taxes to pay off the debt to the bankers from their swindle and so yes it's a big message
[02:44.660 --> 02:49.460]  to government that we don't want what they're doing we don't like what they're doing the
[02:49.460 --> 02:54.940]  problem is just like I told Democrats don't hold your breath for Obama to do the right
[02:54.940 --> 02:59.300]  thing I'm telling Republicans out there and conservatives don't hold your breath with
[02:59.300 --> 03:13.820]  the Republican Party but people are waking up faster and faster and faster and faster
[03:13.820 --> 03:18.220]  whereas it took years for people to wake up to a particular political parties fraud now
[03:18.220 --> 03:24.820]  it only takes months and so there has been a major realignment against tyranny against
[03:24.820 --> 03:35.740]  corruption in this country there has been a massive realignment a huge realignment now
[03:35.740 --> 03:41.660]  for the establishment the only question is can they sabotage that realignment can their
[03:41.660 --> 03:47.980]  operatives misguide that realignment and that's what Rush Limbaugh and Glenn Beck and others
[03:47.980 --> 03:54.420]  are for though Rush Limbaugh is does some good actually he was against the bailout from
[03:54.420 --> 04:00.500]  the beginning even when Bush was for it he was he's criticized the Patriot Act being
[04:00.500 --> 04:06.700]  used against US citizens as bad as he is he's an angel compared to Glenn Beck I mean Glenn
[04:06.700 --> 04:11.060]  Beck is super bad news but I'll tell you what I'm gonna do I'm not gonna talk about Glenn
[04:11.060 --> 04:21.980]  Beck anymore until next week and I am putting together with Paul Watson a catalog a chronicle
[04:21.980 --> 04:28.020]  of his flip-flopping and his lying and his deceit and who he really is instead of just
[04:28.020 --> 04:34.180]  kind of sideways going after Beck and mentioning things he does on a daily basis we're just
[04:34.180 --> 04:39.180]  putting together a big catalog with video and audio of him in his own words so you can

[09:03.900 --> 09:09.740]  by the end of the broadcast today I'm going to play some clips from the ongoing hearing
[09:09.740 --> 09:18.220]  with Tim Geithner as he's being grilled for all of his clearly criminal activity so that
[09:18.220 --> 09:25.300]  is coming up as well in the last hour well what type of news do we have here in front
[09:25.300 --> 09:34.500]  of us Ron Paul says the US is under a CIA coup and runs our military now you talk about
[09:34.500 --> 09:39.060]  bold most people in history that have come out who have any political power and have
[09:39.060 --> 09:44.940]  stated this have died in hunting accidents car wrecks or canoeing accidents or have
[09:44.940 --> 09:49.900]  heart attacks basically within a month because the CIA was set up by wall street to bring
[09:49.900 --> 09:55.380]  in narcotics to run child kidnapping and to murder anyone that tries to upset what wall
[09:55.380 --> 10:02.340]  streets doing and that's just mainline historical record and Ron Paul came right out and admitted
[10:02.340 --> 10:09.100]  that the CIA is involved in narcotics trafficking and he did this at the campaign for liberty
[10:09.100 --> 10:16.620]  conference that's why I love Ron Paul he just has amazing courage so he's not only going
[10:16.620 --> 10:22.740]  out to the Federal Reserve the private consortium of the true government in this country but
[10:22.740 --> 10:29.980]  he's going after their murder arm their hit arm and you heard Anthony Schaefer of able
[10:29.980 --> 10:34.260]  danger who was who would have been able to kill bin Laden and al-Qaeda leadership in the
[10:34.260 --> 10:41.980]  months before 9 11 he was pulled off of it by the CIA and he said here on air the CIA
[10:41.980 --> 10:47.500]  is taking over the army they run everything they run most the mainstream media they run
[10:47.500 --> 10:58.580]  Glenn Beck they run Chris Matthews and they've got to be stopped they're there to make sure
[10:58.580 --> 11:08.060]  wall street can rob and destroy this country and Ron Paul has called him out Ron Paul is
[11:08.060 --> 11:12.660]  the real bonafide I mean if you don't have discernment out there and haven't watched his history
[11:12.660 --> 11:21.060]  let me just tell you Ron Paul's the real deal and so that is coming up today we're going
[11:21.060 --> 11:26.860]  to play that clip later in this hour Hugo Chavez we have this clip as well but it's
[11:26.860 --> 11:35.140]  in Spanish but Chavez says US weapon caused Haiti quake Venezuelan leader Hugo Chavez
[11:35.140 --> 11:40.340]  yesterday accused the United States of causing the destruction in Haiti by testing a tectonic
[11:40.340 --> 11:47.700]  weapon to induce the catastrophic earthquake that hit the country last week Hugo Chavez
[11:47.700 --> 11:51.940]  said the US was playing God by testing devices capable of creating eco type catastrophes
[11:51.940 --> 12:00.500]  of Spanish newspaper ABC quoted him as saying the 7.0 magnitude quake rattled the desperately
[12:00.500 --> 12:08.940]  poor country on January 12th killing an estimated 100 200,000 people over 2 million are homeless
[12:08.940 --> 12:14.060]  Chavez said the killer quake followed the test of a weapon of earthquakes just offshore
[12:14.060 --> 12:18.220]  from Haiti he did not elaborate on the source of the claim we do know the Pentagon was running
[12:18.220 --> 12:24.860]  a drill of Haiti being hit by a hurricane at the exact same time but that isn't proof
[12:24.860 --> 12:31.860]  Secretary of Defense William Cohen and later when I get to this article I'm going to read
[12:31.860 --> 12:35.260]  from it Secretary of Defense Cohen in the Army Times he gives at a press conference
[12:35.260 --> 12:41.300]  April 28th 1996 said there are other governments have earthquake weapons we have earthquake
[12:41.300 --> 12:46.500]  weapons he called them tectonic weapons but just because they say they have these weapons
[12:46.500 --> 12:50.900]  and we know they do we know they have hurricane creation systems that's been declassified
[12:50.900 --> 12:58.620]  five years ago they had it certified in 67 doesn't mean that's what happened here there
[12:58.620 --> 13:05.140]  are naturally occurring earthquakes in Central and South America and in North America they're
[13:05.140 --> 13:13.300]  particularly bad in Guatemala and places like that and in Ecuador Haiti is not known for
[13:13.300 --> 13:20.020]  particularly bad earthquakes but they do have them they had another one yesterday there is
[13:20.020 --> 13:24.700]  a 1950s declassified plan of the Australian news reported on to the Australian government
[13:24.700 --> 13:29.620]  with the British government wanting to set nukes off on the undersea floor to cause earthquakes
[13:29.620 --> 13:37.980]  and tsunamis and so yes as early as what 1955 in that case 54 excuse me they were saying
[13:37.980 --> 13:44.700]  they had it I don't know I don't know I mean I wouldn't put it past them but Hugo Chavez
[13:44.700 --> 13:49.500]  really is letting power go to his head with really no evidence because I've got the newspaper
[13:49.500 --> 13:56.900]  report here and him on TV saying in Spanish and he doesn't really ever offer any proof
[13:56.900 --> 14:07.340]  but we're gonna get into it nevertheless and get your get your take on that also and again
[14:07.340 --> 14:12.860]  I'm gonna cover this more on Monday instead of just covering back a little here a little
[14:12.860 --> 14:18.100]  there going a look he wants to do tax a new national sales tax and a value added tax which
[14:18.100 --> 14:24.700]  they'll keep on top the income tax to pay off the the the the banks and hey look he
[14:24.700 --> 14:29.540]  said Ron Paul's a terrorist or look he's saying the bailouts needed or look he's saying we
[14:29.540 --> 14:34.780]  got to attack more countries and the Patriot acts good and tortures good instead of just
[14:34.780 --> 14:40.060]  mentioning a few of these we're just creating a catalog of it all in his own words and I'm
[14:40.060 --> 14:50.700]  gonna cover it on Monday because he's dangerous I mean now he says this article is up on the
[14:50.700 --> 14:55.460]  prison planet dot com info wars dot com Beck says truth activists in White House threaten
[14:55.460 --> 15:02.140]  Obama's life I mean it's completely insane no proof no nothing talk about slander libel
[15:02.140 --> 15:07.300]  defamation just comes out and says there's nine eleven truthers in his administration
[15:07.300 --> 15:11.540]  you know the only person that was ever connected nine eleven truth in any way got kicked out
[15:11.540 --> 15:16.260]  cast Sunstein the White House regulations are says arrest nine eleven truthers make
[15:16.260 --> 15:25.140]  it illegal the White House agrees with you Becky and so I want to just like I exposed
[15:25.140 --> 15:32.100]  Obama as a false revolutionary as a deceiver as someone who would lie and bait and switch
[15:32.100 --> 15:37.860]  I did that at the height of his popularity and even mainstream news sites the Obama deception
[15:37.860 --> 15:44.740]  and follow the republic as seminal films that have really damaged Obama because we attacked
[15:44.740 --> 15:50.100]  him not from a fake right wing perspective but from a truthful perspective of what he
[15:50.100 --> 15:56.780]  really is a corporate shell here to rob people and here to get the population to stand down
[15:56.780 --> 16:08.940]  now back is the equivalent of Barack Obama we must target him now
[16:08.940 --> 16:16.300]  we are forced to go after him because he understands what the White House understands what cast
[16:16.300 --> 16:21.140]  Sunstein understands in his talking points the number one enemy of the new world order
[16:21.140 --> 16:28.420]  is nine eleven truth because nine eleven truth exposed that that was a false flag terror attack
[16:28.420 --> 16:32.700]  and they expose other events as false flag terror attacks and we educate the public
[16:32.700 --> 16:36.740]  that there are hundreds of examples where our government other governments admit they
[16:36.740 --> 16:42.140]  stage terror attacks and now the government the Pentagon and the CIA's favorite tool of
[16:42.140 --> 16:53.220]  stage terror is a broken mechanism and back again last night did it again on his show
[16:53.220 --> 16:59.620]  he said nine eleven truth is planning to kill the president and then last night he came
[16:59.620 --> 17:15.580]  out again he came out and basically said the same thing so we have a big problem
[17:15.580 --> 17:21.260]  and so this is what he does over and over and over again but I look I'm going to hold
[17:21.260 --> 17:37.620]  my tongue on the subject I'm going to hold my tongue and I'm just going to properly go
[17:37.620 --> 17:44.940]  after him with a mini documentary that will premiere in the next few weeks the problem
[17:44.940 --> 17:50.660]  is you got so much evil duplicity he's involved in that it it it really is hard to make it
[17:50.660 --> 17:55.020]  short but we're just going to do it and put it out there so it's on record so people
[17:55.020 --> 18:00.180]  start paying attention and start noticing what this guy's doing for anybody who studied
[18:00.180 --> 18:05.740]  how these people operate it is obvious as the nose on your face but I'm done talking
[18:05.740 --> 18:14.980]  about the point is it needs to be exposed and we're going to expose it but isn't it
[18:14.980 --> 18:20.220]  interesting that on the first anniversary of hope and change and everything was going
[18:20.220 --> 18:24.500]  to be different the wars were going to end the Patriot Act was going to end and torture
[18:24.500 --> 18:28.340]  was going to end and secret arrest was going to end and transparency and government was
[18:28.340 --> 18:38.340]  going to be back and there wasn't going to be any more signing statements and it was
[18:38.340 --> 18:43.560]  a new dawn we were saved by the messianic leader Barack Obama a year later a complete
[18:43.560 --> 18:50.020]  rebuke of him the lowest approval rating of any president in history one year in and plunging
[18:50.020 --> 18:57.220]  fast I mean he's way below previous people that had low approval ratings like Jimmy
[18:57.220 --> 19:08.420]  Carter and Dwight Eisenhower he's way beneath them that state senator Brown Scott Brown
[19:08.420 --> 19:13.700]  has now been put into the Senate replacing Ted Kennedy slot Scott Brown election when
[19:13.700 --> 19:19.500]  a massive rebellion against big government the problem is the Republicans are going
[19:19.500 --> 19:25.740]  to continue to expand the Pentagon budget that Obama's already broken the record on they're
[19:25.740 --> 19:29.220]  going to continue to want to use the Patriot Act against the American people you're not
[19:29.220 --> 19:33.220]  going to hear a rebuke of Homeland Security and FEMA training to go up against gun owners
[19:33.220 --> 19:38.700]  conservatives libertarians Ron Paul supporters after all Glenn Beck says Ron Paul supporters
[19:38.700 --> 19:43.340]  need to have the army used against them you're not going to see any of it reversed mark my
[19:43.340 --> 19:48.940]  words when the Republicans get into control of the house next year letter this year into
[19:48.940 --> 19:55.900]  next year they'll be seated next year when the Republicans get into power you're going

[24:30.460 --> 24:35.620]  federal reserve being private the media had demonized people for decades saying it didn't
[24:35.620 --> 24:41.100]  even exist Rothschilds didn't exist Rockefellers didn't exist council on foreign relations
[24:41.100 --> 24:45.220]  didn't exist they actually said that kind of like singing in three years ago saying

[24:50.940 --> 24:56.780]  clip when it was openly announced and billboards up everywhere in the state where I live part
[24:56.780 --> 25:04.180]  of the Napa super highway they think you're so dumb they would tell you it didn't exist
[25:04.180 --> 25:09.100]  and I love the fact that media continues to try this deception but it's hurt them so bad
[25:09.100 --> 25:13.220]  that now they're going yeah we want a world government but it's for your best interest
[25:13.220 --> 25:19.700]  and yeah there is a carbon tax and it's for your best interest but it blows up in their
[25:19.700 --> 25:31.980]  face I mean look at what's happening on the first anniversary of hope and change look
[25:31.980 --> 25:37.140]  at what's happening there is hope and change but it didn't come from Obama by him dashing
[25:37.140 --> 25:48.780]  everyone's hopes for change he's actually woken everybody up their scam on the swine
[25:48.780 --> 26:01.340]  flu has now completely fallen apart the White House TSA nominee Eroll Suthers has withdrawn
[26:01.340 --> 26:07.140]  his nomination after a six-month battle he gave public press conferences where he said
[26:07.140 --> 26:11.660]  that Christians are the number one enemy of the government and the number one terror
[26:11.660 --> 26:20.780]  threat poor Mr. Suthers was simply publicly saying what was in all their training manuals
[26:20.780 --> 26:32.140]  hey you're not supposed to tell the slaves that Eroll Suthers or Eroll you weren't supposed
[26:32.140 --> 26:38.380]  to let the slaves know that the whole government's gunning for the American people you're supposed
[26:38.380 --> 26:43.340]  to be like Glenn Beck and say homeland securities for the brown people in Central Asia in the
[26:43.340 --> 26:49.100]  Middle East and to get up on a show and say Al Qaeda's got nukes in America and is going
[26:49.100 --> 26:56.020]  to nukes any minute that's the Pentagon talking point it came out that they paid Tommy Franks
[26:56.020 --> 27:02.580]  half a million bucks plus to run around and go on TV and go geez shucks I don't want it
[27:02.580 --> 27:08.300]  but it's what we need one more big terror attack like a nuke from Al Qaeda and we're
[27:08.300 --> 27:13.660]  going to have a military form of government in America it's what the people want oh shucks
[27:13.660 --> 27:19.220]  the CIA just hates it they don't want an open dictatorship like they've set up in over a
[27:19.220 --> 27:25.300]  hundred countries oh shucks they set up torture centers all over the world in countries they
[27:25.300 --> 27:31.820]  take over oh shucks we don't want that here we're not dominant powerful psychopathic men

[30:07.780 --> 30:12.500]  or triple your electric bill number two our new energies are wants to control how much
[30:12.500 --> 30:16.980]  power your electric company allows you to have it's true total government control of
[30:16.980 --> 30:22.260]  electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming number three in some areas of the
[30:22.260 --> 30:28.220]  country the power grid is dangerously overloaded and now new socialist legislation is only compounding
[30:28.220 --> 30:32.900]  the problem number four dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids every year
[30:32.900 --> 30:37.300]  thousands of families lose their power from weather related onages number five a solar

[31:19.260 --> 31:25.100]  are calling the shots I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay
[31:25.100 --> 31:30.180]  attention full of the republic identifies the enemies of our nation the criminal offshore
[31:30.180 --> 31:35.860]  cartel hell bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government

[33:40.900 --> 33:56.460]  out his real record I'm gonna expose who he really is because people just watch him day
[33:56.460 --> 34:01.860]  to day and don't see his history so that when he goes further once the republicans get back
[34:01.860 --> 34:07.180]  in office it'll take years everyone will then know the truth and then it was premeditated
[34:07.180 --> 34:10.940]  and then he'll just be like bill o'reilly he'll he'll still be on the air it's just
[34:10.940 --> 34:17.180]  that he will only have the dumbest of the dumb that believe him and that's our job is
[34:17.180 --> 34:21.760]  to get a real constitutional republic back I mean if the change we're gonna get from
[34:21.760 --> 34:26.940]  glenn beckon the republican party is more george bush type behavior that is not what
[34:26.940 --> 34:32.260]  the people want that is not what will save this country you know we do not need a new
[34:32.260 --> 34:36.180]  sales tax we do not need an excise tax or a value added tax that they're gonna keep
[34:36.180 --> 34:40.580]  right along with the income tax for more than a decade I told you when the banks tried
[34:40.580 --> 34:46.020]  to bankrupt us by design they would have conservative groups push a sales tax to replace it and
[34:46.020 --> 34:50.660]  then give you both and now that is happening exactly as I told you because I've looked
[34:50.660 --> 34:54.460]  at the big foundations that have been funding this for more than a decade they've been planning
[34:54.460 --> 35:02.500]  this all along I know their game plan new taxes is not conservative the patriot act
[35:02.500 --> 35:08.580]  being used against the american people is not conservative maroc obama launching new
[35:08.580 --> 35:15.340]  wars is not anti-war it's all a fraud they work for the same people and I know all day
[35:15.340 --> 35:21.420]  beckon others have taken on the political coloration of this radio show and they get
[35:21.420 --> 35:25.820]  up there and say it's not about a D it's not about an R it's about being patriots but
[35:25.820 --> 35:30.700]  then being a patriot means launching more wars and raising taxes and saying that 9-11
[35:30.700 --> 35:36.980]  truthers want to kill obama and that ron paul's a kook and bad and every time I mentioned
[35:36.980 --> 35:40.220]  that I get glenbeck supporters emailing me saying where did he say that where did he
[35:40.220 --> 35:45.180]  say that you must be hiding under a rock last night I did some research and found more than
[35:45.180 --> 35:51.700]  10 clips of him saying it one of them just a few months ago on his radio show that's
[35:51.700 --> 35:55.220]  the problem I haven't even done much research into this guy and it's completely apparent
[35:55.220 --> 36:01.700]  okay obviously you know once I put my thinking cap on and start focusing on somebody I can't
[36:01.700 --> 36:06.740]  stop thinking about him or attacking him just like Obama all you democrats that emailed
[36:06.740 --> 36:11.820]  me and called me and attacked me everywhere how dare you say Obama isn't real change you
[36:11.820 --> 36:17.820]  stinking republican how dare you say how dare you lie about him he never said he was going
[36:17.820 --> 36:21.580]  to end the war he never said he wasn't going to have signing statements he never said he
[36:21.580 --> 36:25.820]  wouldn't hire lobbyist he never said he wouldn't stop torture he never said he wouldn't stop
[36:25.820 --> 36:30.700]  secret arrest he never said he never said he never said he would cut the defense budget
[36:30.700 --> 36:39.860]  he never said yes he did say and we made the film showing his lies and the obama deception
[36:39.860 --> 36:46.620]  did it first and is on record torpedoing obama because our great listeners who are real patriots
[36:46.620 --> 36:51.900]  got the information out to everybody now they've created another counter revolution remember
[36:51.900 --> 36:57.580]  all the democrats all crying and oh my gosh the economy saved I'm going to get my house
[36:57.580 --> 37:03.660]  and car payment paid for my problems are over oh thank you obama you saved me now they're
[37:03.660 --> 37:10.180]  crying now they know they were conned and running into the hands of the republicans as if they're
[37:10.180 --> 37:21.500]  going to save you now we've got to expose them but we are winning on every front their
[37:21.500 --> 37:30.140]  Copenhagen greenhouse gas tax initiative just went down in flames the times of London is
[37:30.140 --> 37:39.460]  reporting the US did not even sign on to the internal UN agreement their flu hoax completely
[37:39.460 --> 37:49.700]  blew up in their face their health care plan the democrats are now in the news saying that
[37:49.700 --> 37:54.980]  this signals the fact that they will not get the health care bill and all they can hope
[37:54.980 --> 38:00.300]  for is the senate version which is the better of the two the least egregious and that the
[38:00.300 --> 38:08.260]  states are still going to block that because it's unconstitutional and unfair the way it's
[38:08.260 --> 38:15.740]  implemented not just weights and measures it's discriminatory that's in flames national
[38:15.740 --> 38:19.620]  polls show the majority of americans are against all these new wars they've launched in Yemen
[38:19.620 --> 38:26.380]  and Pakistan even though they staged the underwater the underwear bomber congressmen are coming
[38:26.380 --> 38:30.500]  out from both parties against the naked body scanners lawsuits are being filed people are
[38:30.500 --> 38:37.980]  taking action and saying no there's a major realignment taking place against big government
[38:37.980 --> 38:48.140]  across the board raw story democrat talking points we can't pass legislation anymore despite
[38:48.140 --> 38:53.420]  majority democrats have conceded they can no longer pass health care on their own ensuring
[38:53.420 --> 38:58.100]  that their key legislative reform either dies or accepts further compromises to gain approval
[38:58.100 --> 39:03.020]  from republican members what republican members want is abortion cut out and that's good but
[39:03.020 --> 39:07.860]  not good enough it's still got the provision to force you to get the overpriced health
[39:07.860 --> 39:16.620]  care it's still got all the bad provisions in it no no we're not going to let the republican
[39:16.620 --> 39:23.740]  sell us out you know dick morris says obama will never get another major piece of legislation
[39:23.740 --> 39:31.340]  passed not unless he sets off a nuke in a major u.s. city i agree with michael savage
[39:31.340 --> 39:37.780]  i'd like to hear glenn beck talk about false flag terror like michael savage did tell the
[39:37.780 --> 39:44.700]  truth once in your life back you up savage but before we do that i want to play ron paul
[39:44.700 --> 39:53.580]  this is ron paul at the campaign for liberty speech he gave he was representative ron paul's
[39:53.580 --> 39:59.380]  as the cia has in effect carried out a coup against the u.s. government the intelligence
[39:59.380 --> 40:04.940]  agency needs to be quote taken out boy kennedy said that they blew his head off speaking to
[40:04.940 --> 40:08.180]  an audience of like minded libertarians at the campaign for liberty regional conference
[40:08.180 --> 40:11.820]  in atlanta over the past weekend i can't wait to get him back on in two weeks talk about
[40:11.820 --> 40:17.620]  this joins us once a month the texas republican said there's been a coup have you heard it's
[40:17.620 --> 40:23.020]  the cia coup the cia runs everything they run the military they're the ones who are
[40:23.020 --> 40:29.460]  over there lobbing lobbing missiles and bombs on countries and of course the cia is every
[40:29.460 --> 40:35.660]  bit as secretive as the federal reserve and yet think of the harm they have done since
[40:35.660 --> 40:40.700]  they were established after world war two they are the government unto themselves they're
[40:40.700 --> 40:47.140]  in business in the drug business they take out dictators we need to take out the cia
[40:47.140 --> 40:56.660]  ron paul we love you you are a man of courage you are a man of strength you are a man of
[40:56.660 --> 41:06.820]  honor you are real you are bonafide ron paul can't prove nine eleven is an inside job but
[41:06.820 --> 41:12.580]  he said he wants a new investigation and there are questions but he says even if you believe
[41:12.580 --> 41:22.580]  the official story the cia created o sama bin laden and allowed him to attack and then
[41:22.580 --> 41:27.140]  we attack the wrong country iraq where none of the hijackers came from when fifteen came
[41:27.140 --> 41:34.540]  from saudi arabia but then every time he comes on this show he says you will we alex
[41:34.540 --> 41:40.580]  we know they will stage things without me even asking so we know where his heart really
[41:40.580 --> 41:49.300]  is the point is he knows what he's doing and ron paul is the real deal judge andrew napolitano
[41:49.300 --> 41:54.620]  is the real deal he's got a fox show but on business with about one tenth of viewers
[41:54.620 --> 42:00.580]  you gave him a daily show would be more popular than beck he's a scholar he's for real i'm
[42:00.580 --> 42:05.580]  not attacking beck he's got a big radio show in a big tv show i'm attacking beck because
[42:05.580 --> 42:14.380]  he's at the head of our movement and is trying to take it over just like i attacked president
[42:14.380 --> 42:19.620]  barack obama because i knew he was a fraud if somebody's a fraud and working for wall
[42:19.620 --> 42:24.540]  street i go after him you don't hear glenn beck saying all at the fed or go after the
[42:24.540 --> 42:30.660]  fed again i'm trying to shut up about him it's just it's so clear to me and for some people
[42:30.660 --> 42:38.780]  it's not clear that's why we're going to make this many documentary the glenn beck deception
[42:38.780 --> 42:45.300]  in fact i was going to come out with police state for the rise of fema march first i'm
[42:45.300 --> 42:49.780]  going to go ahead and have it come out in later march maybe even april now i'm suspending
[42:49.780 --> 43:03.940]  that film right now and we're going full time beck to make this glenn beck deception because
[43:03.940 --> 43:09.300]  i've got to fire on him right now and people won't listen i will be attacked it will be
[43:09.300 --> 43:14.540]  unpopular with many if i was smart i would have cozyed up to him years ago you know i
[43:14.540 --> 43:18.740]  basically don't get on clear channel interviews as much and on other shows that would have
[43:18.740 --> 43:22.860]  me on routinely you notice i'm not on them anymore because of this i've been told basically

[43:52.140 --> 43:58.700]  be glenn beck ladies and gentlemen and i said no and it wasn't hard to say no the only thing

[44:39.420 --> 44:45.420]  to con people back into the left right paradigm it's not gonna work it's over we've devastated
[44:45.420 --> 44:52.340]  you the question is though how fast can we beat these people we've got benedict arnold's
[44:52.340 --> 44:57.660]  in our midst in our general staff and that's why we're losing a lot of battles and winning
[44:57.660 --> 45:02.380]  some as well but we got enemies in the gates enemies in our camp co and tell pro running
[45:02.380 --> 45:07.300]  operations in all directions print me the encyclopedia on benedict arnold i want to
[45:07.300 --> 45:12.580]  read about benedict arnold on air for people and all that matters is we win the war in
[45:12.580 --> 45:25.140]  the end and that the benedict arnold and all his pumps and all his pimps be exposed
[45:25.140 --> 45:30.660]  so i'm coming straight at you buddy you need to know that my listeners are coming straight
[45:30.660 --> 45:37.740]  at you because we understand what you're doing all right here is congressman ron paul who
[45:37.740 --> 45:45.500]  we salute this is courage this is honor this is real here's congressman ron paul on abolish
[45:45.500 --> 45:50.900]  the cia how they've had a coup d'etat over our government our military and how we need
[45:50.900 --> 46:03.660]  to quote take them out here it is
[46:03.660 --> 46:28.460]  it's not even a military that does have a cia runs this and of course the cia is every
[46:28.460 --> 46:35.620]  bit as secret as the fellow reserve and yet think of the harm that they have done since
[46:35.620 --> 46:40.500]  they were established in since world war two they are a government under themselves they're
[46:40.500 --> 46:50.860]  in businesses they're in drug businesses and and and they take on ginseng and he said take
[46:50.860 --> 46:54.380]  the cia out there at the end that was shot from the crowd i'm trying to find a better
[46:54.380 --> 46:59.180]  version of that video if you've got it please send it to us we'd like to include it in the
[46:59.180 --> 47:04.300]  film but people wonder who tommy pilates movie producer that's put me in a few movies scanner
[47:04.300 --> 47:11.940]  darkly and waking life with rick linkletters the director tommy pilata when he was at college
[47:11.940 --> 47:20.300]  at ut shot the video you're about to hear the audio from with a long standing show that
[47:20.300 --> 47:31.820]  ran for more than 15 years on access tv in in austin this is uh ron paul in 1989 being
[47:31.820 --> 47:40.140]  asked about the cia here's that club let's talk about what could be the most explosive
[47:40.140 --> 47:45.460]  issue of this campaign if the mass media would get a hold of and do something about it but
[47:45.460 --> 47:50.380]  they're covering it up and that is the you were talking about the government involvement
[47:50.380 --> 47:56.300]  in drugs there have been government investigations there have been private investigations and
[47:56.300 --> 48:02.540]  we've interviewed a lot of people cia people who have talked about the cia involvement
[48:02.540 --> 48:09.420]  in drug operations for many decades it's public knowledge so once again the media are not
[48:09.420 --> 48:16.740]  saying anything about it that oliver north and his people involved with the the contras
[48:16.740 --> 48:21.580]  have been running drug operations cocaine primarily bringing it back into the united
[48:21.580 --> 48:27.820]  states and there are other investigations which show that george bush's office donald
[48:27.820 --> 48:35.100]  greg particularly the people he was working with have been supervising an enormous drug
[48:35.100 --> 48:42.620]  operation which once again was bringing sending illegal arms or down to the contras and elsewhere
[48:42.620 --> 48:48.620]  and bringing cocaine and other types of drugs back into the united states but neither the
[48:48.620 --> 48:53.900]  democrats aren't talking about this now are the libertarians talking about this and did
[48:53.900 --> 48:59.140]  they put this into the framework of the drug law situation that you're talking about we
[48:59.140 --> 49:02.540]  talk about a whole lot of course we always have the trouble of getting the attention
[49:02.540 --> 49:06.420]  that we think it deserves there have been a few democrats have talked about sir to carry
[49:06.420 --> 49:11.220]  his office and some work he's done a lot of the investigation right and i think he's
[49:11.220 --> 49:15.980]  on to something and i think we've gotten some other information too of course that george
[49:15.980 --> 49:21.060]  or the cia has given oriega over the years two hundred thousand dollars a year or yes
[49:21.060 --> 49:28.220]  and they kept feeding him money even when bush was the head of the cia i think george
[49:28.220 --> 49:34.780]  bush is deep into it well over this head somebody asked me once if i thought george bush knew
[49:34.780 --> 49:39.300]  about as much what's going on as as ronald reagan i think george bush knew a lot more
[49:39.300 --> 49:43.940]  about what was happening in the cia because i think reagan was probably more removed from
[49:43.940 --> 49:49.220]  it i mean just by his own personality and maybe his age or something but i think george
[49:49.220 --> 49:54.140]  bush through his office and through and through the fact that he was a member of this you
[49:54.140 --> 49:59.700]  know head of the cia i think he was very very close to it he knows exactly what was happening
[49:59.700 --> 50:05.740]  and i believe the rule that once a cia member always a cia member and i think it's awful
[50:05.740 --> 50:09.620]  interesting can you imagine it would alarm a few of us in this country of all of a sudden
[50:09.620 --> 50:15.100]  we knew that the leader in the soviet union would be the head kgb agent and here we take
[50:15.100 --> 50:20.980]  our head cia agent and put him you know potentially the head of our entire country i'm fortunately
[50:20.980 --> 50:27.420]  i wish that we could get this information out and i continue to talk about it but i sadly
[50:27.420 --> 50:32.540]  believe that there will be very little said which means that the democrat aren't doing
[50:32.540 --> 50:36.900]  it that means they're involved they're involved also and i don't think there's any doubt about
[50:36.900 --> 50:42.140]  it i mean it was even some other got reported in the iran contra scandals we did know that
[50:42.140 --> 50:51.820]  they're going to come back with the rest of this but uh... again this was shot in eighty-eight

[54:08.940 --> 54:15.380]  back and let rock ball finish up from nineteen eighty eight austin access tv that was a program
[54:15.380 --> 54:19.900]  that ran for more than fifteen years the two u.t. professors ran tommy pilota for four
[54:19.900 --> 54:27.060]  years at u.t. before he went on a few years later to make slacker with rick link letter
[54:27.060 --> 54:32.140]  he was there running and researching on this particular show just an example of the great
[54:32.140 --> 54:38.060]  people that i've got a chance to know living here in austin texas here's ron paul now again
[54:38.060 --> 54:42.380]  last weekend he exposed them for cia narcotics trafficking and said abolish them that they've
[54:42.380 --> 54:53.860]  had a coup over our government and here he is twenty two years ago twenty two years ago
[54:53.860 --> 54:59.100]  telling the truth here it is that there were drugs being drugs involved in and they were
[54:59.100 --> 55:04.740]  selling drugs back and forth i think that might be the number one reason for the drug
[55:04.740 --> 55:09.180]  laws i mean they use and play on the good people of america to support him but i think
[55:09.180 --> 55:16.580]  the number one reason is not not to have high prices for some two-bit drug dealer as much
[55:16.580 --> 55:21.940]  as to raise the funds necessary to for governments to do illegal things whether it's some terrorist
[55:21.940 --> 55:26.740]  government someplace or whether it's our own cia to fund programs that they can't get
[55:26.740 --> 55:32.580]  congress to fund i think it's tragic and the sooner we get rid of the drug laws the
[55:32.580 --> 55:41.180]  sooner this would end well there you go twenty two years ago telling the truth and twenty
[55:41.180 --> 55:46.140]  two years later telling the truth here's savage telling the truth about obama planning
[55:46.140 --> 55:49.940]  the stage terror attacks but glenn beck says anybody that talks about government sponsored
[55:49.940 --> 55:56.500]  terror needs to get in trouble just like cast sunstein the white house regulations are
[55:56.500 --> 56:03.260]  says you need to be arrested what you want to arrest uh... michael savage
[56:03.260 --> 56:07.460]  now i'll make another prediction and i predict that very soon
[56:07.460 --> 56:12.740]  obama will create a crisis along the lines of the right start fire right start fire
[56:12.740 --> 56:14.580]  i don't know what form it will take
[56:14.580 --> 56:18.020]  but i believe that once the minions are seen for what they are
[56:18.020 --> 56:23.100]  ramman u l and his gang will set off a rice dog fire in this country of some kind
[56:23.100 --> 56:27.740]  and they will recall the military dictatorship of lincoln and stand during the civil war
[56:27.740 --> 56:31.060]  when civil civilian suspects were arrested without warrant
[56:31.060 --> 56:34.780]  i will tell you as i sit here i fear that every night as i go to sleep
[56:34.780 --> 56:39.220]  i put nothing past these agitators who have suddenly seized control of the most
[56:39.220 --> 56:43.020]  powerful economy and the most powerful military on earth
[56:43.020 --> 56:45.980]  no my friends i am losing a great deal of sleep every night
[56:45.980 --> 56:47.580]  because i do see
[56:47.580 --> 56:50.660]  this happening right before my eyes again i write
[56:50.660 --> 56:54.580]  all right he goes on and on the point is he said that eleven months ago
[56:54.580 --> 56:56.740]  i've been saying that of course
[56:56.740 --> 56:59.540]  for fourteen years that government stages terror
[56:59.540 --> 57:02.380]  and you notice what savage said this is the key
[57:02.380 --> 57:05.340]  why are we playing this eleven months later
[57:05.340 --> 57:09.860]  he said when they're seen for what they are when they implode when they lose the
[57:09.860 --> 57:11.020]  support
[57:11.020 --> 57:13.420]  we're a year later as we predicted
[57:13.420 --> 57:15.180]  obama is imploding
[57:15.180 --> 57:16.060]  look
[57:16.060 --> 57:18.180]  for the terror attack
[57:18.180 --> 57:23.260]  before the midterm election coming up
[57:23.260 --> 57:28.340]  in seven eight nine months seven eight nine months from now
[57:28.340 --> 57:30.180]  before the elections coming up
[57:30.180 --> 57:31.500]  in november
[57:31.500 --> 57:35.420]  look for them to have a devastating terror attack
[57:35.420 --> 57:39.700]  it could be domestic it could be against our ships they could blame it on iran
[57:39.700 --> 57:40.700]  look
[57:40.700 --> 57:42.700]  for that
[57:42.700 --> 57:45.940]  and they now admit in the mayak and homeland security reports
[57:45.940 --> 57:51.180]  the whole homeland security system has been set up for the american people

[1:02:40.300 --> 1:02:43.700]  and all the different things he's done supporting the patriot act against us
[1:02:43.700 --> 1:02:44.460]  citizens

[1:08:09.500 --> 1:08:14.220]  america and the world are waking up right now
[1:08:14.220 --> 1:08:17.100]  they're waking up to the private banking syndicate
[1:08:17.100 --> 1:08:21.100]  that rules our planet they're waking up the major intelligence agencies
[1:08:21.100 --> 1:08:27.260]  cia masad mi6 all the major governments control the narcotics trade
[1:08:27.260 --> 1:08:31.100]  that's why they keep drugs illegal to keep the price high and unregulated
[1:08:31.100 --> 1:08:35.500]  so they can have larger profits off the black market
[1:08:35.500 --> 1:08:38.780]  they're waking up that the major political parties of every country are
[1:08:38.780 --> 1:08:42.620]  controlled i haven't even gotten to the news
[1:08:42.620 --> 1:08:47.340]  stack yet today that the supreme court has ruled
[1:08:47.340 --> 1:08:51.660]  that corporations can give unlimited political contributions
[1:08:51.660 --> 1:08:55.980]  but private citizens still can't see they're tying your hands
[1:08:55.980 --> 1:09:02.060]  the original campaign finance reform of what 2002
[1:09:02.060 --> 1:09:06.300]  allowed corporations to give more money but for citizens to give less
[1:09:06.300 --> 1:09:12.460]  everything is about tying your hands politically
[1:09:12.460 --> 1:09:16.700]  that's the bottom line of what's going on unabandoned copenhagen deadline
[1:09:16.700 --> 1:09:20.220]  countries not signing on spokesman says the deadline has gone soft
[1:09:20.220 --> 1:09:23.420]  the entire program of global taxation through
[1:09:23.420 --> 1:09:28.140]  carbon dioxide has imploded it's rolled over dead
[1:09:28.140 --> 1:09:31.260]  they're still moving forward with state and city taxes with their operatives in

[1:09:37.420 --> 1:09:43.420]  the swine flu hoax is an admitted mass fraud and is
[1:09:43.420 --> 1:09:47.260]  imploding everything is imploding for these people
[1:09:47.260 --> 1:09:50.860]  their government takeover of health care is in desperate
[1:09:50.860 --> 1:09:54.940]  straits hanging by the last shred of a thread
[1:09:54.940 --> 1:09:59.340]  everything they do is turning to dust everything they do
[1:09:59.340 --> 1:10:05.740]  is rotting and falling apart in front of everyone
[1:10:05.740 --> 1:10:10.540]  but the only way we can be beaten is by letting the main line republican party
[1:10:10.540 --> 1:10:13.980]  hijack things we need them to get control of the
[1:10:13.980 --> 1:10:17.180]  house but then immediately put heat on them
[1:10:17.180 --> 1:10:22.780]  when they continue the entire agenda it took seven years to wake up to bush
[1:10:22.780 --> 1:10:25.980]  it took one year to wake up to obama it needs to take
[1:10:25.980 --> 1:10:30.380]  two weeks to wake up to the republicans the time is running out
[1:10:30.380 --> 1:10:34.620]  the scams don't work anymore we need to run real
[1:10:34.620 --> 1:10:39.260]  libertarian constitutionalist like ron paul like debber medina
[1:10:39.260 --> 1:10:43.340]  like other people we see for every political office we can
[1:10:43.340 --> 1:10:47.340]  we are popular our message is constitutional we need to take over
[1:10:47.340 --> 1:10:52.060]  the republican and democratic parties
[1:10:52.540 --> 1:10:56.140]  so what is the supreme court rule
[1:11:01.660 --> 1:11:07.580]  the supreme court rules today that corporations can give all the money
[1:11:07.580 --> 1:11:11.740]  they want but private citizens can't see they're panicking
[1:11:11.740 --> 1:11:14.700]  they're saying okay we'll tie the citizen's hand to give money
[1:11:14.700 --> 1:11:18.140]  and we'll turn the big banks that robbed everybody loose
[1:11:18.140 --> 1:11:21.740]  we'll dump billions and billions into establishment candidates
[1:11:21.740 --> 1:11:25.580]  we'll put in more electronic voting machines we'll engage in more election
[1:11:25.580 --> 1:11:27.980]  fraud
[1:11:29.260 --> 1:11:33.340]  they're not going to give up power easily they're not going to back off
[1:11:33.340 --> 1:11:36.540]  easily they're not going to go away easily
[1:11:36.540 --> 1:11:41.980]  mike and louisiana you're on the air

[1:12:09.340 --> 1:12:15.420]  it's an hour long interview and almost every single call over 90 percent
[1:12:15.420 --> 1:12:20.460]  brought up 9 11 being an inside job 9 11 truth is the majority in many major
[1:12:20.460 --> 1:12:23.100]  polls that's why they say we're the number one enemy
[1:12:23.100 --> 1:12:27.020]  because they can't stage terror attacks anymore and i salute you sir go ahead
[1:12:27.020 --> 1:12:30.940]  thank you sir i salute you back you are an inspiration
[1:12:30.940 --> 1:12:34.460]  and i don't know how if you know how funny you are
[1:12:34.460 --> 1:12:39.180]  sometimes when you go on your analogies you crack me up you gave
[1:12:39.180 --> 1:12:43.420]  well give me an idea i i i write for the new allen's levy newspaper
[1:12:43.420 --> 1:12:46.620]  uh we don't hold anything back is our motto
[1:12:46.620 --> 1:12:52.620]  uh i have been running a comic strip called conspiracy nut for the past
[1:12:52.620 --> 1:12:56.300]  three months and it's been allowing me to
[1:12:56.300 --> 1:12:59.420]  and you've given me a lot of inspiration in fact i think my next comic
[1:12:59.420 --> 1:13:04.620]  strip is going to be on uh beck uh and off of what the rant you went on
[1:13:04.620 --> 1:13:09.020]  yesterday about the alien's landing and eating purple i don't know you went on
[1:13:09.020 --> 1:13:13.180]  some hilarious rant him saying that 9 11 truth is in the
[1:13:13.180 --> 1:13:16.700]  winehouse and is going to kill obama is the equivalent of saying marvin the
[1:13:16.700 --> 1:13:19.900]  martian is going to land with a can opener and open our
[1:13:19.900 --> 1:13:24.140]  children's brains and eat their brains i mean it's it's as ridiculous
[1:13:24.140 --> 1:13:27.580]  kind of things that you you start coming off with that crack me up
[1:13:27.580 --> 1:13:30.620]  anyway uh you give me an inspiration to start this
[1:13:30.620 --> 1:13:34.940]  comic strip it's very popular and reach we're reaching over 50 000 people
[1:13:34.940 --> 1:13:38.460]  every month here with this trip you're not understanding them
[1:13:38.460 --> 1:13:43.740]  yes um there's one other now i've been doing this a long long time longer than
[1:13:43.740 --> 1:13:47.820]  you've been alive i was involved with the uh early
[1:13:47.820 --> 1:13:51.020]  uh ace trucking company the committee's uh
[1:13:51.020 --> 1:13:54.940]  back that started the free speech movement uh long long ago
[1:13:54.940 --> 1:14:00.460]  uh and one of the tactics we used is one of the things i'm also starting up
[1:14:00.460 --> 1:14:04.140]  here now is a guerrilla street theater group
[1:14:04.140 --> 1:14:08.140]  and we're going to be putting together skits that will be performed
[1:14:08.140 --> 1:14:14.460]  on the street that will gather crowds and as the crowds are gathered the
[1:14:14.460 --> 1:14:20.460]  skits will inform people of the of the different issues we got going on
[1:14:20.460 --> 1:14:24.300]  and at the same time we'll be passing out your dvd
[1:14:24.300 --> 1:14:28.780]  this is extremely effective it's more effective than just
[1:14:28.780 --> 1:14:33.260]  uh passing out dvd i mean just getting out there and saying here here here
[1:14:33.260 --> 1:14:37.020]  when you can gather a lot of people a lot of people are doing street theater
[1:14:37.020 --> 1:14:40.860]  now all over the world where they get a bullhorn and say i love the government
[1:14:40.860 --> 1:14:44.380]  i love the naked body scanners i think it's great that the banks
[1:14:44.380 --> 1:14:48.060]  have taken 28 trillion are keeping it for themselves i think it's wonderful
[1:14:48.060 --> 1:14:50.220]  children are being trained to inform on their parents
[1:14:50.220 --> 1:14:54.860]  that's the american way and this guy made this video that says it's wrong he's a
[1:14:54.860 --> 1:14:59.740]  coke he's scum it's a funny video look at this conspiracy nut
[1:14:59.740 --> 1:15:02.380]  and you give him that boy that's really effective
[1:15:02.380 --> 1:15:06.140]  yes it was now one of the things when i first started the script is about two
[1:15:06.140 --> 1:15:08.940]  months ago i know you receive a lot of things but i
[1:15:08.940 --> 1:15:12.700]  and i also know you illustrate you said you were an illustrator
[1:15:12.700 --> 1:15:16.460]  and uh you inspired me then matter of fact you brought it up again you said
[1:15:16.460 --> 1:15:20.380]  that you brought up this image of obama and
[1:15:20.380 --> 1:15:26.380]  then and uh urnaki and all of them on top of a bunch of dead bodies raising a
[1:15:26.380 --> 1:15:29.900]  flag so i went ahead and did that illustration
[1:15:29.900 --> 1:15:34.780]  and sent it to you along and i've been collecting
[1:15:34.780 --> 1:15:42.220]  uh music uh protest music for for 50 years and i sent you a dvd
[1:15:42.220 --> 1:15:46.700]  or cd with some of the better stuff more obscure stuff that i have
[1:15:46.700 --> 1:15:51.420]  along with the illustration and the first copy of the conspiracy nut
[1:15:51.420 --> 1:15:54.700]  i said that to you about two months ago registered now but i haven't received
[1:15:54.700 --> 1:15:58.220]  anything back if you have your guys check that out and see if you got that

[1:16:03.100 --> 1:16:06.940]  almost all of it piles bags come in a week sir
[1:16:06.940 --> 1:16:10.540]  and we don't even have the staff or the money for more people
[1:16:10.540 --> 1:16:14.300]  and so we're we end up looking at a lot of it but then don't even have time to
[1:16:14.300 --> 1:16:17.980]  respond or do anything with it it's also good to scan stuff
[1:16:17.980 --> 1:16:21.740]  and email it to erin at info wars dot com and other addresses

[1:17:17.740 --> 1:17:22.860]  oh yeah well my topic uh... your spot on with glenn beck by the way he is a
[1:17:22.860 --> 1:17:27.340]  complete trader uh... and i little off subject here but i was
[1:17:27.340 --> 1:17:30.700]  just my point was about uh... the health care
[1:17:30.700 --> 1:17:35.340]  and i was reading an article that said the amish are going to be exempt
[1:17:35.340 --> 1:17:39.660]  from the health care mandate that's right there they're exempt because they
[1:17:39.660 --> 1:17:43.820]  know it's a community of around a half million people in the u.s
[1:17:43.820 --> 1:17:47.420]  that will not do it and they've tried to cps their kids they've tried to break
[1:17:47.420 --> 1:17:50.860]  them up now they just can't force them into it the amish
[1:17:50.860 --> 1:17:56.460]  have no instances of autism uh... lower cancer rates everything because they're
[1:17:56.460 --> 1:18:01.740]  not living in our evil system i absolutely agree i live near amish
[1:18:01.740 --> 1:18:06.780]  people are here in western new york and i guess my point mostly was that
[1:18:06.780 --> 1:18:11.340]  this kind of open to loophole in the case that the uh... globalists do get this
[1:18:11.340 --> 1:18:14.780]  health care mandate uh... you know ram down our throat here
[1:18:14.780 --> 1:18:18.700]  is that it opens up uh... objection on a religious basis
[1:18:18.700 --> 1:18:21.500]  you can object does let listen i have a plan
[1:18:21.500 --> 1:18:25.100]  that never openly announced on air i don't want like
[1:18:25.100 --> 1:18:28.140]  compounds they can call extremist facilities people can do whatever they
[1:18:28.140 --> 1:18:31.900]  want but to have like high-tech amish
[1:18:31.900 --> 1:18:36.540]  where where where groups of people with a but you gotta have strict rules or it
[1:18:36.540 --> 1:18:39.980]  falls apart moved to the country but then have
[1:18:39.980 --> 1:18:43.820]  shifts where they go to high-tech facilities tough to to fight for their
[1:18:43.820 --> 1:18:47.900]  rights and freedoms and fight the new world order but then live in an
[1:18:47.900 --> 1:18:51.580]  agrarian society but keep a completely compartmentalized where they then
[1:18:51.580 --> 1:18:55.260]  rotate into basically like the gun ports
[1:18:55.260 --> 1:18:59.180]  and the info war to go in and be involved in city government locally to
[1:18:59.180 --> 1:19:02.220]  protect themselves is what i'll guarantee you the amish and the men
[1:19:02.220 --> 1:19:05.020]  and i it's are not going to be able to continue their way of life for long the
[1:19:05.020 --> 1:19:09.100]  enemy is coming for them and and anyone that the name of the game with the
[1:19:09.100 --> 1:19:11.500]  globalist is they want you dependent on them
[1:19:11.500 --> 1:19:15.900]  we have to get back to the land and
[1:19:15.900 --> 1:19:19.820]  be self-sufficient but at the same time we've got to wear two hats
[1:19:19.820 --> 1:19:24.220]  and be able to in a limited fashion interface with technology
[1:19:24.220 --> 1:19:28.700]  to take on the new world order you must do this or the matrix will absorb them
[1:19:28.700 --> 1:19:32.140]  the matrix isn't too worried about them right now because
[1:19:32.140 --> 1:19:34.860]  because they're not interfacing in government so they're not threatening
[1:19:34.860 --> 1:19:39.420]  the takeover that's going on around them but as the amish and others get
[1:19:39.420 --> 1:19:41.820]  persecuted more they're beginning to realize they're
[1:19:41.820 --> 1:19:45.660]  going to have to stand up for themselves anything else sir
[1:19:45.660 --> 1:19:49.020]  well just to point on the amish yeah i don't know if this is i'm trying to
[1:19:49.020 --> 1:19:52.940]  research is and from what i understand is the land
[1:19:52.940 --> 1:19:57.740]  that the amish have was given as an ecclesiastical trust

[1:24:23.580 --> 1:24:36.380]  back before elves and before vietnam war came along
[1:24:36.380 --> 1:24:42.220]  before the beetles and yesterday
[1:24:42.220 --> 1:24:48.780]  when a man could still work and still would look on the subject of the amish
[1:24:48.780 --> 1:24:52.860]  they came over from germany and switzerland more than 200 years ago
[1:24:52.860 --> 1:24:58.220]  they were set up in the 1600s and they have been grandfathered
[1:24:58.220 --> 1:25:02.140]  into their land as sovereign landholders there's a bunch of
[1:25:02.140 --> 1:25:05.020]  different subgroups there's the old amish the new amish
[1:25:05.020 --> 1:25:08.620]  the menonites there's a bunch of different groups
[1:25:08.620 --> 1:25:12.940]  what the amish need to test is having a group
[1:25:12.940 --> 1:25:20.940]  in their council break off and buy small facilities in town
[1:25:20.940 --> 1:25:27.820]  and elect representatives who outside of their communities has to be separate
[1:25:27.820 --> 1:25:31.580]  rotate through into a high technology facility
[1:25:31.580 --> 1:25:35.980]  to run their own websites to fight for their rights to fight for their freedoms
[1:25:35.980 --> 1:25:40.220]  and to be politically involved in the community but have it compartmentalized
[1:25:40.220 --> 1:25:44.060]  even if they have to have groups that volunteer
[1:25:44.060 --> 1:25:52.060]  to split off and to be the defense system
[1:25:52.060 --> 1:25:56.140]  for their rural communities but other modern people
[1:25:56.140 --> 1:25:59.340]  groups who've never been part of the amish or menonites they could do this
[1:25:59.340 --> 1:26:03.420]  as well we see that happening in new hampshire
[1:26:03.420 --> 1:26:06.940]  with this free state project tens of thousands of people have moved there
[1:26:06.940 --> 1:26:10.860]  they're really changing things they're creating these loosely net
[1:26:10.860 --> 1:26:14.540]  communities that are high technology interfaced
[1:26:14.540 --> 1:26:19.020]  with the system to fight it because there's no doubt that the
[1:26:19.020 --> 1:26:22.300]  establishment is beginning to target the amish and menonites and others and
[1:26:22.300 --> 1:26:27.980]  try to set them up and bring them down but again that's for them to decide
[1:26:27.980 --> 1:26:31.340]  it's just that their things have changed we are on the 21st century
[1:26:31.340 --> 1:26:34.220]  and the new world order is not going to allow these groups to continue operating
[1:26:34.220 --> 1:26:37.420]  the way they have been coming up supreme court removes limits on corporate
[1:26:37.420 --> 1:26:41.100]  labor donations campaigns will cover that right now let's go to jeff in
[1:26:41.100 --> 1:26:45.500]  indiana jeff you're on the air mr joe with absolute pleasure to be talking
[1:26:45.500 --> 1:26:49.260]  to you i mean it is a truly an honor um
[1:26:49.260 --> 1:26:53.740]  since i've been listening to your show i i'm a loyal podcast listener um
[1:26:53.740 --> 1:26:57.980]  everyone tells me how much healthier i look i'm telling how much how much
[1:26:57.980 --> 1:27:01.500]  healthier i feel i recommend you show to everybody with that small
[1:27:01.500 --> 1:27:05.980]  joke aside um i have two activists ideas um
[1:27:05.980 --> 1:27:11.500]  one of them is um where i live i won't name any businesses but uh there are
[1:27:11.500 --> 1:27:15.020]  boxes of vending machines they happen to be red
[1:27:15.020 --> 1:27:21.020]  and um they distribute dvds and what i do is i i take a copy
[1:27:21.020 --> 1:27:28.220]  of you know especially your your newest films uh you know um are especially
[1:27:28.220 --> 1:27:33.340]  wonderful for this but you you take the dvd you put a piece of a note in it
[1:27:33.340 --> 1:27:38.860]  and it says it watch this dvd if at the very least put this dvd back where you
[1:27:38.860 --> 1:27:43.420]  found it for the next person to watch it if you feel like i do you will take this
[1:27:43.420 --> 1:27:47.580]  dvd and you will make a copy of it and give it to your friends your family
[1:27:47.580 --> 1:27:52.780]  um and then also put one back on the box um i i made an email address so that the
[1:27:52.780 --> 1:27:57.180]  person can contact me if they need to find out different ways to do things
[1:27:57.180 --> 1:28:01.100]  but it's a method that i think would easily
[1:28:01.100 --> 1:28:04.540]  you can find people who are already looking for a movie to watch
[1:28:04.540 --> 1:28:09.180]  and you can spring their mind open um i hope that other activists out there
[1:28:09.180 --> 1:28:11.420]  will will take this idea and run with it
[1:28:11.420 --> 1:28:15.100]  my other idea or the other thing i do is
[1:28:15.100 --> 1:28:18.780]  is sir i have taken to gardening and it is an absolute
[1:28:18.780 --> 1:28:22.780]  i mean to to to get back to the creative
[1:28:22.780 --> 1:28:26.860]  it is the most creative i felt since having a child
[1:28:26.860 --> 1:28:31.100]  in in the sense of of being at one with our creator
[1:28:31.100 --> 1:28:35.980]  and uh yes humans are meant to be out on the sun outside working in the dirt
[1:28:35.980 --> 1:28:39.980]  again we're losing our humanity and in little steps
[1:28:39.980 --> 1:28:43.980]  turn into big steps turn into long marches against tyranny
[1:28:43.980 --> 1:28:47.740]  and it's simple things like drinking purified water eating healthier food
[1:28:47.740 --> 1:28:50.860]  getting out on the sun spending more time with our families turning the
[1:28:50.860 --> 1:28:55.260]  television sets off uh for at least part of the day
[1:28:55.260 --> 1:29:01.740]  and you will start to extricate yourself from the matrix like system
[1:29:01.740 --> 1:29:05.580]  yes sir absolutely i mean to pull a carrot out of the ground
[1:29:05.580 --> 1:29:09.500]  wash it off and hand it to my three-year-old there is no better feeling
[1:29:09.500 --> 1:29:13.820]  in the world knowing that you're giving him what god has created
[1:29:13.820 --> 1:29:20.380]  and and i i hope that did you i i hope i was clear as far as my activist idea
[1:29:20.380 --> 1:29:25.260]  no i mean you said boxes it's you said red boxes at certain businesses i mean
[1:29:25.260 --> 1:29:29.100]  i uh i tell people to make copies of my films and give them to people and tell
[1:29:29.100 --> 1:29:33.340]  them to make copies i don't i don't know what the red boxes are no
[1:29:33.340 --> 1:29:38.140]  oh well it's basically it's it's their their dvd vending machines
[1:29:38.140 --> 1:29:41.180]  that they have throughout the nation especially where i live
[1:29:41.180 --> 1:29:44.460]  and i know that they're in new york chicago
[1:29:44.460 --> 1:29:49.020]  all your major metropolitan they they they they are in most uh
[1:29:49.020 --> 1:29:51.660]  and you put them in the youth you put them in the bin where they drop down
[1:29:51.660 --> 1:29:55.500]  we're on the march the empires on the run
[1:29:55.500 --> 1:30:00.460]  alex jones and the gcn radio network
[1:30:01.820 --> 1:30:05.900]  hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone
[1:30:05.900 --> 1:30:10.140]  this is our last chance to not relive history as we're finishing off this
[1:30:10.140 --> 1:30:13.100]  agenda that they'll be pulling the rug from underneath the
[1:30:13.100 --> 1:30:16.300]  americans at home i have a tremendous influence
[1:30:16.300 --> 1:30:20.300]  on our president in congress and they really are calling the shots
[1:30:20.300 --> 1:30:25.500]  i think it's incumbent upon all of us as american citizens to pay attention
[1:30:25.500 --> 1:30:29.500]  full of the republic identifies the enemies of our nation the criminal
[1:30:29.500 --> 1:30:34.140]  offshore cartel hell bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes

[1:30:40.140 --> 1:30:43.980]  saying who do we make the checkout to today seems like nobody does care

[1:32:53.500 --> 1:33:07.740]  eFoodsDirect.com again that number 1-800-409-5633
[1:33:15.340 --> 1:33:20.380]  all right i said open phones today and yes i've got Hugo Chavez saying the
[1:33:20.380 --> 1:33:24.300]  earthquake was a tectonic weapon that is a ridiculous
[1:33:24.300 --> 1:33:29.580]  conspiracy theory it's ridiculous for him to say
[1:33:29.580 --> 1:33:33.420]  it was a tectonic attack he should have said
[1:33:33.420 --> 1:33:37.420]  could it be a tectonic attack and quote the pentagon admitting they have these
[1:33:37.420 --> 1:33:40.060]  weapons he should have called for an investigation
[1:33:40.060 --> 1:33:43.660]  but he discredits himself because i have the text of what he said from a
[1:33:43.660 --> 1:33:47.500]  venezuelan government approved newspaper the media is
[1:33:47.500 --> 1:33:50.860]  controlled there with him saying it was an attack
[1:33:50.860 --> 1:33:54.060]  and they're not giving evidence
[1:33:54.620 --> 1:33:57.660]  so we're going to be covering that i'm going to get into the attacks on free
[1:33:57.660 --> 1:34:02.380]  speech in the country supreme court removes list
[1:34:02.380 --> 1:34:07.660]  on limits of corporate labor donations to campaigns
[1:34:09.820 --> 1:34:13.260]  so it's saying groups
[1:34:13.260 --> 1:34:17.340]  groups and corporations can give money
[1:34:17.340 --> 1:34:21.340]  but the restrictions on individual giving it's still there
[1:34:21.340 --> 1:34:29.900]  the way i read this ruling that's just like campaign finance reform of 2002
[1:34:29.900 --> 1:34:35.660]  that bush signed on to breaking his promise not to sign it remember
[1:34:36.940 --> 1:34:41.900]  the mccain fine gold legislation said that corporations could double the money
[1:34:41.900 --> 1:34:45.420]  they gave but individuals could give less
[1:34:45.420 --> 1:34:49.420]  so great labor unions and big corporations can give more money but the
[1:34:49.420 --> 1:34:53.980]  citizens can't the way i read this calling and correct me if i'm wrong
[1:34:53.980 --> 1:34:56.860]  and believe me we get stuff wrong especially when it's brand new and we're
[1:34:56.860 --> 1:35:00.300]  trying to analyze it kind of like they said they were going to have the
[1:35:00.300 --> 1:35:03.580]  hearings today but now they postpone them to next week with
[1:35:03.580 --> 1:35:07.180]  geithner and pulsing but then the news is still reporting that some type of
[1:35:07.180 --> 1:35:10.540]  banking hearings going on so we're trying to keep track of that i mean
[1:35:10.540 --> 1:35:14.140]  there is so much going on in the world
[1:35:15.020 --> 1:35:19.980]  ladies and gentlemen i am a documentary filmmaker i have made
[1:35:19.980 --> 1:35:24.380]  i don't know what is it 24 films and the last
[1:35:24.380 --> 1:35:27.660]  couple i mean they just get better and better fall the republic the production
[1:35:27.660 --> 1:35:31.180]  quality the information shattering left right paradigm exposing the
[1:35:31.180 --> 1:35:33.420]  environmental takeover that has nothing to do with the
[1:35:33.420 --> 1:35:35.900]  environment the police state takeover how they're
[1:35:35.900 --> 1:35:39.660]  brainwashing the boy scouts to serve homeland security
[1:35:39.660 --> 1:35:44.060]  it's all covered in the obama deception fall the republic
[1:35:44.060 --> 1:35:47.820]  and both these dvds are discounted right now info wars dot com
[1:35:47.820 --> 1:35:50.940]  we're also carrying the new film that i didn't produce but i'm
[1:35:50.940 --> 1:35:55.900]  shocked by its quality its shadow government very revealing

[1:37:22.380 --> 1:37:25.580]  systematically go through it all because it's so important and there's so much of
[1:37:25.580 --> 1:37:31.340]  it so much good news i mean i'm buoyed and excited
[1:37:31.340 --> 1:37:33.980]  but at the same time i know the globalists are using
[1:37:33.980 --> 1:37:37.740]  their tricks again and so i want to expose that

[1:37:49.580 --> 1:37:53.820]  they're in full retreat ladies and gentlemen the problem is if we take the
[1:37:53.820 --> 1:37:57.020]  bait and switch and let establishment republicans take over again

[1:38:07.260 --> 1:38:13.020]  and i believe obama is at the greatest threat point right now
[1:38:13.020 --> 1:38:17.500]  at the greatest danger level right now of staging a terror attack
[1:38:17.500 --> 1:38:21.740]  or starting a new war or releasing a bio weapon so the government can respond
[1:38:21.740 --> 1:38:24.460]  as the savior
[1:38:25.740 --> 1:38:28.700]  we have the rand corporation saying the government needs
[1:38:28.700 --> 1:38:32.540]  to stage events we have all the cfr white papers
[1:38:32.540 --> 1:38:36.380]  ladies and gentlemen now is the danger zone
[1:38:36.380 --> 1:38:39.820]  we have got to start warning people to look for stage terror

[1:38:52.300 --> 1:38:57.820]  say your name is mad you know that you're a human calling from somewhere
[1:38:57.820 --> 1:39:03.500]  just you know just say i am homo erectus i am homo sapiens sapien from texas
[1:39:03.500 --> 1:39:06.860]  or new yorker wherever you're calling from it says that we have a member of
[1:39:06.860 --> 1:39:10.460]  the amish community but they don't want their name said
[1:39:10.460 --> 1:39:15.820]  uh so let's just call you uh adam and let's go to adam adam where are you
[1:39:15.820 --> 1:39:21.260]  calling from in the united states hi alex i'm actually calling from michigan
[1:39:21.260 --> 1:39:24.940]  okay so i'm a little bit nervous here but i just uh i
[1:39:24.940 --> 1:39:31.660]  this amish thing keeps coming up and uh listening i know that there's a lot of
[1:39:31.660 --> 1:39:36.380]  myths out there there's one thing i would like to clarify
[1:39:36.380 --> 1:39:42.860]  is as far as the land thing um we're just like everybody else we pay
[1:39:42.860 --> 1:39:49.340]  our land taxes we have the deq the dnr all those
[1:39:49.340 --> 1:39:56.300]  uh outside government agents um you know unelected
[1:39:56.300 --> 1:40:00.140]  people you know breathing down our throat too
[1:40:00.140 --> 1:40:05.900]  we're not exempt from those things you know there are some things that help
[1:40:05.900 --> 1:40:10.300]  us as a community and as a people we have we have a voice
[1:40:10.300 --> 1:40:15.900]  we do have a steering committee that represents the amish in general they go
[1:40:15.900 --> 1:40:21.020]  to washington um back where we're one of the pioneers of the
[1:40:21.020 --> 1:40:25.340]  homeschooling movement that actually started out as being a
[1:40:25.340 --> 1:40:30.540]  pro-school school where our fathers actually went to prison because we
[1:40:30.540 --> 1:40:34.220]  didn't no longer want to send our children to the
[1:40:34.220 --> 1:40:38.700]  public school you know maybe i should do an interview sometime with you
[1:40:38.700 --> 1:40:41.420]  and i should add that we actually know who you are
[1:40:41.420 --> 1:40:45.100]  sure and that and that you just called in to one of the back lines and we're
[1:40:45.100 --> 1:40:49.020]  not saying your name but you really are amish uh but the the
[1:40:49.020 --> 1:40:51.820]  i mean so we can confirm but i've done my own research and
[1:40:51.820 --> 1:40:56.060]  absolutely the amish are under massive sustained attack
[1:40:56.060 --> 1:40:59.340]  and so even some of the old amish as the groups are known
[1:40:59.340 --> 1:41:02.780]  are having to have some of the elders you know the big daddy
[1:41:02.780 --> 1:41:07.420]  as a lot of locals call them you know have to get cars now
[1:41:07.420 --> 1:41:11.260]  have to interface have to have to deal with this they are coming after your
[1:41:11.260 --> 1:41:14.300]  kids with a cps they are harassing you they are
[1:41:14.300 --> 1:41:17.980]  trying to destroy you right now and that's my point is
[1:41:17.980 --> 1:41:21.500]  is the amish need to get even more proactive but i wasn't aware of
[1:41:21.500 --> 1:41:25.100]  how active you guys are i mean in the amish community
[1:41:25.100 --> 1:41:28.300]  and i know i've talked to some that are very aware of what's happening
[1:41:28.300 --> 1:41:32.060]  do you guys know about the new world order and what's going on
[1:41:32.060 --> 1:41:35.980]  i would say yes and no it really depends on on which
[1:41:35.980 --> 1:41:40.060]  part of the communities that you're talking about we're a fairly diversified
[1:41:40.060 --> 1:41:44.060]  people at this point we do have a strong
[1:41:44.060 --> 1:41:48.380]  belief of work ethics and being separated from the world it's called
[1:41:48.380 --> 1:41:52.140]  nonconformity to the world and i think there's a protection in that
[1:41:52.140 --> 1:41:56.620]  um i don't want to use up a lot of time but this is one of the
[1:41:56.620 --> 1:42:03.020]  um modos biblical modos for example that a lot of our people will go by and
[1:42:03.020 --> 1:42:09.340]  quote and this is from timothy uh two and first timothy two
[1:42:09.340 --> 1:42:13.420]  and says that i exhort therefore that first of all supplications prayers
[1:42:13.420 --> 1:42:16.220]  and assessments giving a thanks be made for all men
[1:42:16.220 --> 1:42:20.780]  and then it says for kings and for all they're in authority that we may lead a
[1:42:20.780 --> 1:42:26.940]  quiet and peaceful life in all godliness and honesty so that is
[1:42:26.940 --> 1:42:29.980]  why we are here in the united states to begin with
[1:42:29.980 --> 1:42:34.780]  and so that we can do that and so we don't we're not
[1:42:34.780 --> 1:42:39.340]  super proactive as far as in politics goes because we tried to stay separated
[1:42:39.340 --> 1:42:43.100]  from that but this is all that we ask the government
[1:42:43.100 --> 1:42:47.340]  to do for us to let us lead a quiet and peaceful life
[1:42:47.340 --> 1:42:50.700]  and i believe that there's a lot of other people out there that won't have
[1:42:50.700 --> 1:42:55.580]  that same wish they just want to live and we do
[1:42:55.580 --> 1:42:58.540]  realize that the new world order is a threat to that
[1:42:58.540 --> 1:43:02.380]  and all these uh so-called security majors that are now in control
[1:43:02.380 --> 1:43:05.260]  so you know i want to thank you for what you do
[1:43:05.260 --> 1:43:08.460]  of course i don't agree with everything but that's fine
[1:43:08.460 --> 1:43:12.620]  we all want to simply live and i believe that's what you're trying to tell
[1:43:12.620 --> 1:43:15.180]  people adam what's the bible verse the amish
[1:43:15.180 --> 1:43:19.340]  have about uh not going to churches because there's a lot of verses about
[1:43:19.340 --> 1:43:23.180]  don't worship in temples that's actually very occultic
[1:43:23.180 --> 1:43:27.260]  uh but again actually not something that we get out of the bible that was
[1:43:27.260 --> 1:43:31.740]  due to persecution and uh no no actually i was
[1:43:31.740 --> 1:43:35.500]  reading a quote out of the encyclopedia
[1:43:35.500 --> 1:43:39.420]  it is a bible verse about you know don't don't
[1:43:39.420 --> 1:43:43.500]  don't worship in the in the temples okay well
[1:43:43.500 --> 1:43:46.940]  i guess i don't know about that but what i do know is that
[1:43:46.940 --> 1:43:50.940]  when we were persecuted back in the reformation time
[1:43:50.940 --> 1:43:56.300]  um it wasn't safe to meet in public so we started meeting at home that kind of
[1:43:56.300 --> 1:43:59.660]  continued as a tradition now a lot of our churches actually do have church
[1:43:59.660 --> 1:44:02.940]  houses now so are you originally from switzerland or
[1:44:02.940 --> 1:44:06.860]  germany or i'm switzerland yes and then right
[1:44:06.860 --> 1:44:09.980]  many of my forefathers would have given their life
[1:44:09.980 --> 1:44:14.140]  to not bend to the government and their
[1:44:14.140 --> 1:44:19.900]  unscriptural and uh tyrannical demand just simply you know allow themselves to
[1:44:19.900 --> 1:44:25.020]  be beheaded and drowned and burned at the stake
[1:44:25.020 --> 1:44:27.900]  that's right because the homage got persecuted by the catholic church didn't
[1:44:27.900 --> 1:44:32.140]  they uh not just the catholic church actually
[1:44:32.140 --> 1:44:37.740]  the reformers were even crueler when it actually come down to it there's
[1:44:37.740 --> 1:44:41.340]  yes but the catholics started it between the when uh
[1:44:41.340 --> 1:44:45.980]  wingley and uh martin luther they they ended up being worse than the
[1:44:45.980 --> 1:44:50.700]  than the catholics are just bad
[1:44:50.700 --> 1:44:53.660]  but yeah people don't people don't know that there was also
[1:44:53.660 --> 1:44:57.740]  there was a lot of protestant persecution uh yeah
[1:44:57.740 --> 1:45:00.540]  i mean i've read the histories of all the people that killed
[1:45:00.540 --> 1:45:04.460]  yeah but that's you know that's neither here nor there
[1:45:04.460 --> 1:45:07.900]  we you know the bible tells us that if we get persecuted in one
[1:45:07.900 --> 1:45:10.940]  place then just move to another and i realize that's not
[1:45:10.940 --> 1:45:17.260]  your philosophy and that's okay i'm not here to tell you that that's not
[1:45:17.260 --> 1:45:21.740]  you know for you to be like that but we just tried to follow
[1:45:21.740 --> 1:45:27.500]  what we understand to be our moral compass the creator of the universe
[1:45:27.500 --> 1:45:31.660]  and he did leave his last will and testament for us here on this earth
[1:45:31.660 --> 1:45:36.700]  we tried to follow that and all we want we don't want
[1:45:36.700 --> 1:45:41.820]  wealth fame political power we simply want to live
[1:45:41.820 --> 1:45:46.220]  a quiet and peaceful life that and am i accurate in saying
[1:45:46.220 --> 1:45:49.820]  that the government is really starting to come in and harass you more
[1:45:49.820 --> 1:45:53.660]  well it's like the um in for instance this uh
[1:45:53.660 --> 1:45:58.380]  new health care thing for example social security we're exempt from social
[1:45:58.380 --> 1:46:02.540]  security we don't pay in but then we also do not draw social
[1:46:02.540 --> 1:46:07.340]  security but we pay our taxes on our land most of the
[1:46:07.340 --> 1:46:11.740]  goes to school but we fund our own school with absolutely no government
[1:46:11.740 --> 1:46:15.180]  help we don't get government help to fund our own school
[1:46:15.180 --> 1:46:19.740]  and there's and we don't have special privileges we're hardworking people
[1:46:19.740 --> 1:46:25.580]  that simply don't you know
[1:46:26.380 --> 1:46:31.740]  i'm not trying to pat anybody on the back but it comes down to a fact
[1:46:31.740 --> 1:46:38.220]  that if you lose your moral compass and you don't have anything to guide you
[1:46:38.220 --> 1:46:42.220]  life becomes meaningless and so that's what's happening with our
[1:46:42.220 --> 1:46:46.540]  society and i've heard you talk many times about our society
[1:46:46.540 --> 1:46:51.340]  the core issue here is our society and i realize that there's a big mean
[1:46:51.340 --> 1:46:57.020]  censure agenda behind a lot of the powerful in the world but the reason
[1:46:57.020 --> 1:47:00.300]  it's been able to happen is because people did become
[1:47:00.300 --> 1:47:03.740]  rudderless they're empty and so that can be filled with the world's evil i
[1:47:03.740 --> 1:47:06.140]  appreciate your call good to hear from you
[1:47:06.140 --> 1:47:08.620]  all right i'm gonna try to really accelerate through calls now i just

[1:47:23.500 --> 1:47:28.140]  deception that's a great idea uh i mean i would even do a little showcase on
[1:47:28.140 --> 1:47:32.220]  some of the other uh fox news talking heads like uh handy limbaugh or
[1:47:32.220 --> 1:47:37.420]  riley who uh all seem to claim a false allegiance to the constitution
[1:47:37.420 --> 1:47:40.700]  where they you know they talk about we need torture we need wiretaps we need
[1:47:40.700 --> 1:47:46.220]  more war you know if they tell obama to defy the constitution one hand
[1:47:46.220 --> 1:47:49.980]  but then on the other hand they they get mad when he defies it for things like
[1:47:49.980 --> 1:47:54.140]  health care and these guys are just uh total and they say
[1:47:54.140 --> 1:47:57.580]  and they give him left cover they say he's not attacking enough countries
[1:47:57.580 --> 1:48:00.940]  when he's brought forward the two biggest defense budgets in history
[1:48:00.940 --> 1:48:04.620]  is letting the cia take over the pentagon absolutely running wild and
[1:48:04.620 --> 1:48:08.620]  they say oh he's a communist no he's not a communist he's a globalist
[1:48:08.620 --> 1:48:13.980]  banker looter yeah these guys these guys all claim the false allegiance that
[1:48:13.980 --> 1:48:17.900]  they're these true patriots and that they're great americans and that they're
[1:48:17.900 --> 1:48:22.460]  they're for the constitution but hey they just they completely act and say
[1:48:22.460 --> 1:48:27.100]  things in the total contrary to that you know it's it's it's do as i say not
[1:48:27.100 --> 1:48:30.780]  none of the do and uh it's it unfortunately i mean
[1:48:30.780 --> 1:48:35.180]  the many people in this nation they just they listen to that
[1:48:35.180 --> 1:48:38.620]  and they fell out on their ethics their morals their allegiance to the
[1:48:38.620 --> 1:48:42.860]  constitution and even their values associated to the religious faith
[1:48:42.860 --> 1:48:48.220]  in order to align himself to these these talking heads and these politicians
[1:48:48.220 --> 1:48:52.860]  and and they say we've got to give up our rights and torture people because
[1:48:52.860 --> 1:48:55.820]  al-qaeda will get us i appreciate your call great points
[1:48:55.820 --> 1:49:02.060]  here is the quote it's from ax 1724 we found it
[1:49:02.060 --> 1:49:06.380]  it says the majority of old order amish congregations do not have church
[1:49:06.380 --> 1:49:09.420]  buildings but hold worship services and private homes
[1:49:09.420 --> 1:49:13.180]  thus they are sometimes called house amish
[1:49:13.180 --> 1:49:16.860]  this practice is based on a verse from the new testament
[1:49:16.860 --> 1:49:20.700]  the god who made the world and all things in it
[1:49:20.700 --> 1:49:24.700]  since he is the lord of heaven and earth does not dwell in temples
[1:49:24.700 --> 1:49:30.540]  made with hands ax 1724
[1:49:30.540 --> 1:49:35.260]  and of course christ also said look at the Pharisees and Sadducees up on the
[1:49:35.260 --> 1:49:38.140]  you know at the temple praying in front of everybody telling you how good they
[1:49:38.140 --> 1:49:41.740]  are go into your prayer closet privately
[1:49:41.740 --> 1:49:45.580]  that's where you're going to find god so i find god at 3 30 in the morning
[1:49:45.580 --> 1:49:49.420]  in my living room with the lights off
[1:49:49.420 --> 1:49:55.580]  not up on the radio or at church in front of people all dressed up fancy
[1:49:55.580 --> 1:49:59.340]  telling people what a great christian i am and how good i am
[1:49:59.340 --> 1:50:03.180]  now i think church communities are good if you use them to fellowship and

[1:56:00.780 --> 1:56:04.300]  then educate others because if we educate the public which
[1:56:04.300 --> 1:56:07.420]  that film does and i believe a devastating fashion
[1:56:07.420 --> 1:56:11.900]  it's over for the new world order if the people understand what they're facing
[1:56:11.900 --> 1:56:17.020]  there's no way they'll go along with it and the good news is
[1:56:17.020 --> 1:56:20.860]  the bad news things are getting bad so people will finally
[1:56:20.860 --> 1:56:25.260]  wake up and listen they are ready to wake up and even if they laugh when they
[1:56:25.260 --> 1:56:29.180]  watch it today as they get squeezed tighter and tighter jessica
[1:56:29.180 --> 1:56:33.500]  they're going to remember that the film showed them the entire paradigm that
[1:56:33.500 --> 1:56:39.900]  two hour 24 minute film gives you a to z a general overview of who the elite are
[1:56:39.900 --> 1:56:44.620]  how they operate what they're doing and how they are the
[1:56:44.620 --> 1:56:48.540]  developers the progenitors of this sick society
[1:56:48.540 --> 1:56:52.140]  and that's why i think it's so so informative
[1:56:52.140 --> 1:56:59.820]  absolutely i i just and like i said my mom has been telling me this for years
[1:56:59.820 --> 1:57:04.860]  and i i kind of grew up around i mean you know my mom was the
[1:57:04.860 --> 1:57:10.460]  you know 60s 70s kind of hippie chick whatever and
[1:57:10.460 --> 1:57:16.300]  was very docile but kind of had an idea of
[1:57:16.300 --> 1:57:22.060]  what the government does it was more her uncle or i'm sorry my
[1:57:22.060 --> 1:57:28.700]  uncles that um tried to push it on us as kids you know you know so the
[1:57:28.700 --> 1:57:32.620]  seeds were planted the seeds were planted decades ago
[1:57:32.620 --> 1:57:36.940]  and now they've sprouted as see again my film didn't
[1:57:36.940 --> 1:57:40.540]  tell you really anything you didn't already know you already knew it but
[1:57:40.540 --> 1:57:44.860]  hadn't consciously faced it again those seeds were already there that's what
[1:57:44.860 --> 1:57:48.380]  i'm saying patriots have planted billions of
[1:57:48.380 --> 1:57:53.980]  seeds worldwide and tyranny is the water and sunshine that makes them sprout
[1:57:53.980 --> 1:57:59.180]  yes yeah you just woke up a whole new plant in my
[1:57:59.180 --> 1:58:03.980]  in my body and i am going to just cast this on to

[2:01:26.300 --> 2:01:28.540]  at work because i guess you kind of got a
[2:01:28.540 --> 2:01:32.620]  reputation as a conspiracy theorist so i uh
[2:01:32.620 --> 2:01:35.980]  went and i found other places on the internet i actually had the quotes and
[2:01:35.980 --> 2:01:39.180]  then they like through the magazine what whatever
[2:01:39.180 --> 2:01:42.620]  you know or the newspaper where all these quotes that you said
[2:01:42.620 --> 2:01:46.140]  they would they were right there so i highlighted them all i took them to work

[2:02:13.260 --> 2:02:16.300]  country that no one can believe it's happening even with the
[2:02:16.300 --> 2:02:20.460]  you know the 9-11 in our economy crashing people are still in denial

[2:06:03.900 --> 2:06:08.060]  power generator number one new climate legislation could easily double or
[2:06:08.060 --> 2:06:12.300]  triple your electric bill number two our new energies are wants to control how
[2:06:12.300 --> 2:06:15.020]  much power your electric company allows you to have
[2:06:15.020 --> 2:06:19.260]  it's true total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid
[2:06:19.260 --> 2:06:23.740]  technology is coming number three in some areas of the country the power grid is
[2:06:23.740 --> 2:06:27.340]  dangerously overloaded and now new socialist legislation
[2:06:27.340 --> 2:06:31.180]  is only compounding the problem number four dangerous weather is always a
[2:06:31.180 --> 2:06:34.380]  threat to local grids every year thousands of families lose
[2:06:34.380 --> 2:06:38.300]  their power from weather related onages number five a solar power generator

[2:08:01.100 --> 2:08:04.780]  the genesis communications radio network probably presents
[2:08:04.780 --> 2:08:11.980]  the alex jones show because there's a war on for your mind
[2:08:11.980 --> 2:08:15.900]  we are back live ladies and gentlemen we are simulcasting
[2:08:15.900 --> 2:08:22.780]  this radio show at prisonplanet.tv
[2:08:22.780 --> 2:08:26.380]  all right coming up i want to go over the fact that big government
[2:08:26.380 --> 2:08:33.660]  the new order agenda is imploding on every front but they still control the
[2:08:33.660 --> 2:08:36.220]  government the bureaucracy most of the planet
[2:08:36.220 --> 2:08:39.420]  they're not going to go away they're not going to stop unless we force them to
[2:08:39.420 --> 2:08:43.820]  go away unless we force them to stop but there is a huge
[2:08:43.820 --> 2:08:49.020]  awakening happening there is a lot of positive things going on
[2:08:49.020 --> 2:08:52.060]  the state senator brown getting elected to the u.s senate
[2:08:52.060 --> 2:08:56.300]  is a very positive message to big government
[2:08:56.300 --> 2:08:59.500]  there's a lot of news i want to cover coming up at the bottom of the hour and
[2:08:59.500 --> 2:09:03.660]  about 23 minutes from now but i want to go back to your calls
[2:09:03.660 --> 2:09:07.580]  now i want to try to start over we had a rough start with
[2:09:07.580 --> 2:09:11.020]  randy and florida with me trying to understand exactly what he was getting
[2:09:11.020 --> 2:09:15.740]  at there's an article from truth alliance
[2:09:15.740 --> 2:09:19.740]  you can't both support the troops and the constitution
[2:09:19.740 --> 2:09:25.020]  and i actually agree with that because the media has
[2:09:25.020 --> 2:09:30.140]  miscast supporting troops hitler said that he said you've got to
[2:09:30.140 --> 2:09:32.620]  support my war against the u.s and against
[2:09:32.620 --> 2:09:38.300]  england and against france and russia or you don't support the troops
[2:09:38.300 --> 2:09:44.300]  i have mainstream news articles where as soon as the troops are done serving
[2:09:44.300 --> 2:09:47.660]  they go through their barracks in iraq and afghanistan
[2:09:47.660 --> 2:09:51.900]  and in one case the guy's stepdaughter they'd mailed him a picture of her that
[2:09:51.900 --> 2:09:55.420]  was on their facebook of her in a bathing suit and they said
[2:09:55.420 --> 2:09:59.180]  a bathing suit is child pornography this is abc news
[2:09:59.180 --> 2:10:06.700]  and he's being court-martialed for it so they love persecuting the troops
[2:10:06.700 --> 2:10:10.780]  they love going after him obama tried to cut their healthcare last year
[2:10:10.780 --> 2:10:14.220]  and he wanted to make the troops pay for their own
[2:10:14.220 --> 2:10:18.460]  healthcare through getting their own insurance making the troops serve two
[2:10:18.460 --> 2:10:22.220]  three four tours is not supporting the troops
[2:10:22.220 --> 2:10:25.980]  starting all these new wars is not supporting them congress never declared
[2:10:25.980 --> 2:10:30.620]  war uh since world war two not in vietnam not in desert
[2:10:30.620 --> 2:10:35.980]  store desert storm one in none of these events
[2:10:35.980 --> 2:10:41.660]  was war declared congress said well for wmds in iraq for nukes
[2:10:41.660 --> 2:10:46.220]  you do have this limited mandate to remove the weapons which you didn't have
[2:10:46.220 --> 2:10:50.220]  so i'm trying to understand what randy is getting at randy do you agree
[2:10:50.220 --> 2:10:54.140]  do you disagree i mean for me it's the definition
[2:10:54.140 --> 2:10:58.540]  of supporting the troops it's not supporting the troops sending them into
[2:10:58.540 --> 2:11:03.420]  preemptive illegal wars or having military people
[2:11:03.420 --> 2:11:10.140]  in in offices in in dc uh controlling predator drones dropping bombs on
[2:11:10.140 --> 2:11:15.340]  weddings in pakistan uh so i mean what are you getting at here
[2:11:15.340 --> 2:11:19.100]  what i'm saying is that the constitution requires a declaration of war and as you
[2:11:19.100 --> 2:11:21.820]  said it hasn't been done since world war two
[2:11:21.820 --> 2:11:26.380]  and you saw any order to deploy to these wars is unconstitutional and lawful
[2:11:26.380 --> 2:11:30.700]  and even more so importantly it's immoral and our soldiers should refuse that if
[2:11:30.700 --> 2:11:33.820]  they're going to take their oath seriously and that includes the members
[2:11:33.820 --> 2:11:37.980]  of this oath keepers website which as far as i'm concerned is
[2:11:37.980 --> 2:11:41.340]  it's phony because many of the members on that site are
[2:11:41.340 --> 2:11:46.300]  active duty military serving and i or have served in iraq in afghanistan
[2:11:46.300 --> 2:11:49.660]  yet they claim they're keeping their oath like when they engage in unlawful
[2:11:49.660 --> 2:11:53.980]  and unconstitutional activity it can't be done
[2:11:53.980 --> 2:11:57.580]  well particularly the oath keepers are saying we're going to follow the
[2:11:57.580 --> 2:12:01.980]  declaration of independence constitution and they're trying to educate
[2:12:01.980 --> 2:12:05.340]  people that don't confiscate guns in the us of your
[2:12:05.340 --> 2:12:09.500]  ordered and things like that and i mean i think overall they're very positive
[2:12:09.500 --> 2:12:13.420]  that's why chris mathews and others are viciously attacking them but i
[2:12:13.420 --> 2:12:15.820]  appreciate your call randy glad you called
[2:12:15.820 --> 2:12:20.460]  uh let me give you this article right here this is out of w
[2:12:20.460 --> 2:12:24.540]  gn radio but it but it's also i saw an abc news article about it
[2:12:24.540 --> 2:12:30.620]  galesburg an illinois national guard soldier in afghanistan has been
[2:12:30.620 --> 2:12:33.820]  charged with the u.s army with possessing child pornography over
[2:12:33.820 --> 2:12:37.260]  pictures of a young relative his mother says she's sending
[2:12:37.260 --> 2:12:42.700]  he didn't even take the picture but but what's crazy about this is
[2:12:42.700 --> 2:12:49.580]  that the photo that the news showed is several photos of a little girl
[2:12:49.580 --> 2:12:52.700]  running around in the yard playing with a water hose
[2:12:52.700 --> 2:12:57.340]  and in one of them it shows the back of the bathing suit and that the army put
[2:12:57.340 --> 2:13:01.180]  the report out saying because part of her lower butt
[2:13:01.180 --> 2:13:05.340]  is shown this is child porn and folks i see articles now
[2:13:05.340 --> 2:13:09.820]  they're mainstream news we saw the abc news you covered that big case
[2:13:09.820 --> 2:13:15.020]  in arizona last year where it didn't even show
[2:13:15.020 --> 2:13:19.260]  the little girl's bodies one was two one was three
[2:13:19.260 --> 2:13:22.540]  they got out of the bathtub they had towels around them
[2:13:22.540 --> 2:13:26.460]  and their mom took a photo every parent has done that
[2:13:26.460 --> 2:13:29.260]  plus you got two three four kids you know the littler ones you stick them in
[2:13:29.260 --> 2:13:33.420]  the bathtub together all they play with rubber duckies and boats or whatever
[2:13:33.420 --> 2:13:37.580]  the government's now got cases saying kids together in a bathtub
[2:13:37.580 --> 2:13:41.580]  is some type of sexual assault on the two children
[2:13:41.580 --> 2:13:44.540]  meanwhile the government's full of all these degenerate pedophiles they're
[2:13:44.540 --> 2:13:49.740]  constantly getting caught most your top cps people are always being busted
[2:13:49.740 --> 2:13:53.260]  they're five to seven times more likely depending on the federal government
[2:13:53.260 --> 2:13:56.540]  report to be pedophiles or abusers in government
[2:13:56.540 --> 2:14:00.220]  and they're saying a photo of two little girls one with a towel around her
[2:14:00.220 --> 2:14:03.660]  another with a towel around her with them beside each other
[2:14:03.660 --> 2:14:07.980]  they said that was having them engaged in sexual activity
[2:14:07.980 --> 2:14:11.900]  because they were you know huddled with towels out of the bath
[2:14:11.900 --> 2:14:16.860]  see now they're going to take your kids for wearing bathing suits at the at the
[2:14:16.860 --> 2:14:21.260]  at the swimming pool and you'll say but it's a bathing suit and they'll say
[2:14:21.260 --> 2:14:26.620]  we have swat teams now we'll ban your gun show even if it's legal
[2:14:26.620 --> 2:14:29.980]  you know oh an old man was cleaning his gun in his garage neighbor saw it
[2:14:29.980 --> 2:14:33.420]  he had 12 guns and a couple thousand rounds ammo that's an arsenal there's no
[2:14:33.420 --> 2:14:39.420]  law against it it isn't an arsenal there's no law you still got a prison
[2:14:39.420 --> 2:14:42.140]  i mean they send people to prison every day for not even committing crimes they
[2:14:42.140 --> 2:14:47.260]  just make up other folks we
[2:14:47.260 --> 2:14:51.660]  it just came home to me again yesterday
[2:14:51.660 --> 2:14:55.020]  again just how criminal and illegitimate this government is
[2:14:55.020 --> 2:15:02.620]  because uh matt ryan who works in our office worked at the city
[2:15:02.620 --> 2:15:07.660]  in the gas and electric customer service line
[2:15:08.380 --> 2:15:13.660]  and he said upwards of 90 or more in fact he said they never pay
[2:15:13.660 --> 2:15:18.780]  he he said 10 of the time they had huge meetings about this
[2:15:18.780 --> 2:15:23.020]  the illegals pay the first bill or the 250 bucks to get their power and gas
[2:15:23.020 --> 2:15:26.700]  turned on and then three months later when
[2:15:26.700 --> 2:15:29.980]  they turn their power off another person calls with another console
[2:15:29.980 --> 2:15:33.340]  matricula that are fake ids the mexican consulate gives them to
[2:15:33.340 --> 2:15:36.940]  anybody i can go get one there's been investigative reports on it
[2:15:36.940 --> 2:15:41.100]  and then they just never pay they only pay when they first get it turned on or
[2:15:41.100 --> 2:15:44.300]  get it turned back on and then that's passed on but then an old
[2:15:44.300 --> 2:15:48.300]  lady who's ten dollars down in her bill they turn their power off and you've
[2:15:48.300 --> 2:15:51.500]  seen those reports up and freezing to death or burning up to death in the
[2:15:51.500 --> 2:15:54.780]  summer all over the country
[2:15:57.740 --> 2:16:01.100]  i mean i saw this winter every two or three days
[2:16:01.100 --> 2:16:05.420]  in fact let's just google it live on air man dies in home man freezes the death
[2:16:05.420 --> 2:16:08.780]  in home after power turned off i mean you'll just see hundreds and hundreds
[2:16:08.780 --> 2:16:13.500]  and hundreds of reports uh where this is happening
[2:16:13.500 --> 2:16:16.700]  and so there's so many facets to this the illegal aliens
[2:16:16.700 --> 2:16:21.500]  all over there's more than 800 sanctuary cities
[2:16:21.500 --> 2:16:24.940]  and the i've had already surveyed the police of austin he said alex we have
[2:16:24.940 --> 2:16:27.980]  to do this we have to know who these people are so we can protect them when
[2:16:27.980 --> 2:16:31.340]  there's a problem that doesn't stop
[2:16:31.340 --> 2:16:35.420]  illegals from calling if there's a problem at their home
[2:16:35.420 --> 2:16:38.940]  you know this isn't some sanctuary where there's a commission of a crime
[2:16:38.940 --> 2:16:43.340]  and so if you call with a crime or a problem they don't arrest you or deport
[2:16:43.340 --> 2:16:47.660]  you see that's how they started sanctuaries 20 years ago
[2:16:47.660 --> 2:16:51.340]  now it's we're gonna hire illegal aliens for the police force
[2:16:51.340 --> 2:16:56.540]  that's associated press we're going to say you can have
[2:16:56.540 --> 2:16:59.420]  everything without an id card you can have a bank account you can have a
[2:16:59.420 --> 2:17:03.980]  housing loan but citizens have to show three ids
[2:17:03.980 --> 2:17:08.060]  to get power or gas and the minute you don't pay you're in trouble
[2:17:08.060 --> 2:17:11.260]  i talked to uh one of my old family friends

[2:25:58.460 --> 2:26:04.220]  the bombing of the governor's mansion was clearly a staged event all the
[2:26:04.220 --> 2:26:06.780]  evidence in hindsight we weren't sure at the time
[2:26:06.780 --> 2:26:10.460]  points towards that i've told you i believe a false flag
[2:26:10.460 --> 2:26:16.380]  i said this what three weeks ago
[2:26:17.500 --> 2:26:20.220]  when it came out that federal agents were trying to
[2:26:20.220 --> 2:26:23.820]  provocateur people into firebombing brave new books
[2:26:23.820 --> 2:26:30.380]  trying to connect it into 9-11 truthers uh then groups connected into those
[2:26:30.380 --> 2:26:33.260]  same organizations the media tried to say that they were
[2:26:33.260 --> 2:26:36.540]  involved in firebombing the governor's mansion
[2:26:36.540 --> 2:26:39.740]  and did they get some mentally ill person to go do this
[2:26:39.740 --> 2:26:44.140]  god only knows or is it just a crazy person thank god no one was injured
[2:26:44.140 --> 2:26:46.700]  no one was injured shots fired at texas

[2:27:09.500 --> 2:27:11.900]  the building the officers were in the process of securing the
[2:27:11.900 --> 2:27:18.140]  capitals third floor around noon so
[2:27:18.140 --> 2:27:23.020]  said tristan leshischer police communications operator the building

[2:27:26.700 --> 2:27:30.380]  lisa block said a witness said he heard at least four
[2:27:30.380 --> 2:27:36.620]  shots fired this is now all over the national media
[2:27:36.620 --> 2:27:40.860]  i've told you look for false flag attacks we told you the flu thing was fake
[2:27:40.860 --> 2:27:45.180]  that's now admitted mainstream media a giant fair mongering federalization
[2:27:45.180 --> 2:27:50.300]  un globalization profit drill we've told you so many of these events
[2:27:50.300 --> 2:27:55.820]  are staged we don't know about this one at this time
[2:27:55.820 --> 2:28:01.900]  but the first report came out about 52 minutes ago
[2:28:01.900 --> 2:28:05.900]  and the latest report came out about 15 minutes ago
[2:28:05.900 --> 2:28:13.180]  from kxan so we're continuing to monitor that situation shots fired
[2:28:13.180 --> 2:28:16.620]  at the texas
[2:28:16.620 --> 2:28:21.260]  capitol building remember when somebody drove a gasoline truck into the
[2:28:21.260 --> 2:28:24.860]  california building california statehouse
[2:28:24.860 --> 2:28:27.740]  you didn't really ever hear much about that because it looked like it was a
[2:28:27.740 --> 2:28:31.180]  real event if this is staged they'll hype it
[2:28:31.180 --> 2:28:38.380]  to the stars but uh 1-800-259-9231
[2:28:38.380 --> 2:28:44.860]  1-800-259-9231 if we don't get any eyewitnesses we're going to hold the
[2:28:44.860 --> 2:28:49.180]  lines open for tessa larry matt bob and others that
[2:28:49.180 --> 2:28:56.380]  were patiently holding 1-800-259-9231 and it'll only
[2:28:56.380 --> 2:29:00.540]  take a few dozen of these type events to try to scare government going along
[2:29:00.540 --> 2:29:02.780]  with the police state just like an underwear bomber
[2:29:02.780 --> 2:29:05.820]  has been used to say everybody's got a naked body scan to fly and all the
[2:29:05.820 --> 2:29:09.180]  courthouses are going to get it a real attack that's not going to stop
[2:29:09.180 --> 2:29:12.860]  somebody from going up against a capitol or a courthouse
[2:29:12.860 --> 2:29:16.220]  it'll just stop somebody from sneaking one in everybody can't be treated as if
[2:29:16.220 --> 2:29:18.940]  they're guilty and lose their second amendment
[2:29:18.940 --> 2:29:23.660]  because there's a few nuts out there and with so many of these events
[2:29:23.660 --> 2:29:28.140]  it is staged but they're also forcing the population more and more people
[2:29:28.140 --> 2:29:37.340]  into this mindset 1-800-259-9231 we can also take local calls 512-646-1776

[2:36:08.380 --> 2:36:17.100]  if you want to talk about the capital situation
[2:36:17.100 --> 2:36:24.220]  and for listeners generally across the country
[2:36:24.220 --> 2:36:26.940]  this got me sidetracked i wanted to go over news blitz right now but i'm just
[2:36:26.940 --> 2:36:31.180]  going to continue with your calls because um in the next hour i'm going to
[2:36:31.180 --> 2:36:34.700]  get into more of the news we haven't covered yet
[2:36:34.700 --> 2:36:37.580]  i mean i've alluded to a lot of it but i don't want to really drill into some of
[2:36:37.580 --> 2:36:42.300]  it let's go to calls right now rob in hawaii you're on the air
[2:36:42.300 --> 2:36:45.740]  thanks for taking my call thanks for calling what's on your mind
[2:36:45.740 --> 2:36:49.180]  um well first i wanted to thank you for how you ended your show yesterday like
[2:36:49.180 --> 2:36:53.340]  stressing a piece for resistance um because myself i'm a former marine
[2:36:53.340 --> 2:36:57.420]  and i could tell you 13 years ago my company commander was going on asking
[2:36:57.420 --> 2:37:01.100]  our platoon if we would raise weapons or disarm our own
[2:37:01.100 --> 2:37:05.100]  brothers flat out this was 13 years ago
[2:37:05.100 --> 2:37:08.220]  um yeah that standard procedure the military now trains to take on the
[2:37:08.220 --> 2:37:11.580]  american people go ahead oh absolutely um so so what i was
[2:37:11.580 --> 2:37:14.460]  going to say like people need to understand any sort of armed or
[2:37:14.460 --> 2:37:18.140]  violent revolutionary system just feeds right in that's what they want
[2:37:18.140 --> 2:37:21.020]  that way that justifies them to go overboard
[2:37:21.020 --> 2:37:24.300]  um so i really appreciate that you were stressing it yesterday and then if you
[2:37:24.300 --> 2:37:28.620]  could have two quick questions for you sure um one have you ever considered
[2:37:28.620 --> 2:37:33.900]  running for political office for about a week one time i ran for republican
[2:37:33.900 --> 2:37:37.580]  uh state house because nobody was running against the democrat when i saw
[2:37:37.580 --> 2:37:41.420]  the rules and the campaign rules and i just couldn't
[2:37:41.420 --> 2:37:43.820]  stomach going out and trying to raise the money
[2:37:43.820 --> 2:37:47.340]  and i really i was talked into it and my gut was
[2:37:47.340 --> 2:37:51.100]  i can do more outside the system than i can in the system
[2:37:51.100 --> 2:37:54.780]  educating people right i understand that fully
[2:37:54.780 --> 2:37:58.860]  okay um my second question is back on um yesterday you were talking about 9 11
[2:37:58.860 --> 2:38:02.300]  truth um when charlie sheen released that uh video
[2:38:02.300 --> 2:38:05.740]  message to the president like it really inspired me to go research
[2:38:05.740 --> 2:38:08.620]  how many other celebrities have spoken out because i wanted to make myself a
[2:38:08.620 --> 2:38:11.580]  few youtube videos and i ended up finding so many
[2:38:11.580 --> 2:38:14.700]  footage of so many celebrities like it just blows my mind
[2:38:14.700 --> 2:38:18.060]  so i was i was wondering if there's any way you or so many no could kind of
[2:38:18.060 --> 2:38:21.900]  organize all the groups like art and art tech and engineers
[2:38:21.900 --> 2:38:25.100]  all the celebrities and just get everybody together and just
[2:38:25.100 --> 2:38:30.060]  bring this to the public already i mean it's well try and try and get
[2:38:30.060 --> 2:38:33.980]  celebrities i mean if a celebrity's at a event or a benefit
[2:38:33.980 --> 2:38:36.940]  and somebody walks over and says what do you think about 9 11 they'll say inside
[2:38:36.940 --> 2:38:39.500]  job but once you call them to really go out on
[2:38:39.500 --> 2:38:42.460]  this show or really get together for a big stand
[2:38:42.460 --> 2:38:45.500]  then their managers and others start threatening them
[2:38:45.500 --> 2:38:48.780]  the media took the bait with charlie sheen he knew this would happen he knew
[2:38:48.780 --> 2:38:52.140]  because of all his past they would end up attacking him but then that would
[2:38:52.140 --> 2:38:55.500]  bring the issues up so charlie sheen was perfect
[2:38:55.500 --> 2:38:58.380]  because that's one of the few celebrities they would actually cover
[2:38:58.380 --> 2:39:02.300]  because they thought they could discredit it because of some of his past
[2:39:02.300 --> 2:39:08.140]  it actually blew up in their face but i mean again i'm just trying to organize
[2:39:08.140 --> 2:39:13.820]  building my new studio making films i have limited staff limited funds
[2:39:13.820 --> 2:39:16.620]  you know i had to pull people off key projects just to send them down to the
[2:39:16.620 --> 2:39:20.940]  capital we don't you know we can't just spontaneously
[2:39:20.940 --> 2:39:24.220]  create like god can you know we're not just here just doing
[2:39:24.220 --> 2:39:26.540]  things and making things but i appreciate your call
[2:39:26.540 --> 2:39:31.100]  we do what we can rob and i appreciate it uh let's talk to joe in texas joe you're
[2:39:31.100 --> 2:39:38.780]  on the air hey hi alex are you sir pretty good alex um i was calling about uh
[2:39:38.780 --> 2:39:43.900]  uh i was around austin just a kid when they had the tower shootings there my
[2:39:43.900 --> 2:39:47.740]  stepdad was uh with the air force and i remember that
[2:39:47.740 --> 2:39:52.060]  distinctly and it's just coincidental about the gun show
[2:39:52.060 --> 2:39:55.180]  and then i also want to tell you you can check on
[2:39:55.180 --> 2:39:58.700]  if you check like what i think it was wednesday night or tuesday night of this
[2:39:58.700 --> 2:40:03.100]  week our local news uh san anton had uh
[2:40:03.100 --> 2:40:08.940]  ready to guys house the guy had uh was in a uniform military uniform and he

[2:43:37.580 --> 2:43:40.540]  i work at the capital they're gonna think it's me
[2:43:40.540 --> 2:43:44.380]  i want to leave you with this big box of stuff and then my guys walked out and
[2:43:44.380 --> 2:43:51.100]  looked and there were off-duty i mean uh unmarked police cars and
[2:43:51.100 --> 2:43:54.060]  and people walking around like it was some big bus like they wanted to get
[2:43:54.060 --> 2:43:59.580]  him in my office with this box and they called me because i was gone
[2:43:59.580 --> 2:44:03.500]  no it was when i was on the radio this happened one and and
[2:44:03.500 --> 2:44:06.860]  then when i ran out of the radio this is their old office
[2:44:06.860 --> 2:44:10.300]  they said did we do the right thing and i said hell yeah you did the right thing
[2:44:10.300 --> 2:44:14.220]  do not take anything it was a big box and then they and they were smart enough
[2:44:14.220 --> 2:44:17.980]  to walk out front and and and see the cops and it was going to be on the news
[2:44:17.980 --> 2:44:21.260]  alex jones he did it you know i mean but luckily
[2:44:21.260 --> 2:44:24.460]  we have a containment operation to keep these infiltrators out
[2:44:24.460 --> 2:44:27.340]  and they're constantly trying to get in we had to move just because of it
[2:44:27.340 --> 2:44:31.260]  no one is allowed at this office never if you know our address come to our door
[2:44:31.260 --> 2:44:34.540]  you will be screamed at not because you're bad but because you could be an
[2:44:34.540 --> 2:44:38.220]  operative uh i mean i mean folks that we i live in a
[2:44:38.220 --> 2:44:41.420]  james bond situation and i'm not james bond
[2:44:41.420 --> 2:44:45.260]  okay
[2:44:50.140 --> 2:44:56.620]  so we have that going on we talked to lisa blot the spokeswoman for

[2:45:02.860 --> 2:45:05.660]  most of them are listeners of the show when i'm down there they tell me about
[2:45:05.660 --> 2:45:09.660]  the show but uh 24 year old male from houston we need to get this out because
[2:45:09.660 --> 2:45:12.940]  this is not yet in the other news this is breaking
[2:45:12.940 --> 2:45:16.380]  we just got this from her three minutes ago 24 year old male
[2:45:16.380 --> 2:45:20.300]  from houston fired several shots on the south steps of the capital
[2:45:20.300 --> 2:45:24.940]  no reported injuries including the gunman she would not say she said she
[2:45:24.940 --> 2:45:29.100]  did not know what direction he shot did he fire in the air did he fire down
[2:45:29.100 --> 2:45:32.700]  congress avenue did he fire into the granite steps
[2:45:32.700 --> 2:45:36.780]  was it blanks uh is this some
[2:45:36.780 --> 2:45:40.700]  folks if they if it turns out this guy's ever been in psychiatric care of the
[2:45:40.700 --> 2:45:44.060]  government or was in the army that's where they do the brainwashing
[2:45:44.060 --> 2:45:47.500]  or was protected and already made threats
[2:45:47.500 --> 2:45:53.660]  or they can also threaten your family to get you to do this
[2:45:53.660 --> 2:45:57.580]  there is an intelligence operation we've proven going on down there
[2:45:57.580 --> 2:46:03.020]  to provoke a tour now i don't know if if this is a nut or not but i'm telling
[2:46:03.020 --> 2:46:06.700]  you i predicted a staged attack on the
[2:46:06.700 --> 2:46:10.700]  governor's mansion or capital i remember that from memory i don't
[2:46:10.700 --> 2:46:15.900]  know how i do it uh but um
[2:46:20.780 --> 2:46:23.820]  and there's nothing really there's nothing really new here
[2:46:23.820 --> 2:46:28.060]  again texas state capital shots fired at least four shots
[2:46:28.060 --> 2:46:34.300]  jaren oh you need this uh here you bet awesome yeah give it to curtain
[2:46:34.300 --> 2:46:39.660]  demo thank you um dps shots fired at state
[2:46:39.660 --> 2:46:43.340]  capital austin chronicle houston chronicle excuse me
[2:46:43.340 --> 2:46:47.820]  jim majid visiting from new york said he was inside the building on the first
[2:46:47.820 --> 2:46:51.820]  floor and people started rushing to the south entrance prompted by reaction of
[2:46:51.820 --> 2:46:57.180]  two troopers he said the man next to her said he heard four or five pops
[2:46:57.180 --> 2:47:01.820]  when uh majid or whatever he pronounced his name got outside she saw about 25
[2:47:01.820 --> 2:47:05.980]  officers surrounding a man lying on the ground
[2:47:05.980 --> 2:47:09.420]  on his side in a fetal position his officers held him down
[2:47:09.420 --> 2:47:12.940]  he was not resisting arrest she said she heard one of the troopers say there
[2:47:12.940 --> 2:47:16.780]  might be another person on the building's third floor folks this
[2:47:16.780 --> 2:47:20.700]  sounds completely staged this guy's got a gun and he's shooting it and they
[2:47:20.700 --> 2:47:24.140]  didn't shoot him you come in my office or my
[2:47:24.140 --> 2:47:31.260]  my area and you're shooting a gun you are deader to doornail
[2:47:31.260 --> 2:47:35.900]  and that's how the police are trained they should have killed this guy
[2:47:35.900 --> 2:47:40.300]  but if he shot the shots laid the gun down he's either a lunatic looking for
[2:47:40.300 --> 2:47:46.060]  attention or this was staged and more and more this is looking staged
[2:47:46.060 --> 2:47:52.300]  i don't know if it was staged we will certainly learn more as this unfolds
[2:47:55.340 --> 2:47:57.980]  i don't know
[2:47:59.420 --> 2:48:03.260]  a witness told statesmen that six shots were fired in rapid succession
[2:48:03.260 --> 2:48:07.580]  that's fox news were heard at noon
[2:48:10.060 --> 2:48:12.860]  state employees are standing on the grounds as authorities secure the
[2:48:12.860 --> 2:48:16.220]  capital building authorities thought they were
[2:48:16.220 --> 2:48:22.300]  peace officers man i don't know what to uh say about this i'll tell you
[2:48:22.300 --> 2:48:26.220]  joe in texas you're on the air go ahead
[2:48:27.500 --> 2:48:32.860]  hey okay i'm out of control larry in texas go ahead larry
[2:48:32.860 --> 2:48:37.900]  hello alex hey buddy hey i got some ballistic information that might
[2:48:37.900 --> 2:48:42.220]  save somebody's life if uh if they own a 223
[2:48:42.220 --> 2:48:46.540]  uh back in 82 i sit at the sheriff's office waiting to go on patrol
[2:48:46.540 --> 2:48:50.620]  and i was thumbing through a law magazine and uh
[2:48:50.620 --> 2:48:54.220]  it was articles about the ineffectiveness of
[2:48:54.220 --> 2:49:02.060]  the m16 at a roadblock so my partner was expecting his new delivery of m16
[2:49:02.060 --> 2:49:06.060]  a semi-alimatic version you know i finished the article i passed it
[2:49:06.060 --> 2:49:09.100]  across the desk as hey you might want to get your money back after you read
[2:49:09.100 --> 2:49:13.420]  this so he read it and said ah that had nothing about that
[2:49:13.420 --> 2:49:19.500]  so i uh anticipated this so i contacted a tow driver asked him if he had a
[2:49:19.500 --> 2:49:24.140]  vehicle he could sacrifice so uh he got his new gun in we went
[2:49:24.140 --> 2:49:27.740]  out there and uh he had a clip of a full
[2:49:27.740 --> 2:49:33.020]  metal jacket and a clip of hollow point and the three tests that we
[2:49:33.020 --> 2:49:36.380]  done according to article was put a cardboard target behind the steering
[2:49:36.380 --> 2:49:39.740]  wheel stand 10 steps in front of the vehicle and open
[2:49:39.740 --> 2:49:46.460]  up on it so uh he raised up cut loose with five rounds we went up and looked
[2:49:46.460 --> 2:49:50.300]  and all it does is just you could do more damage with a daisy red rider just
[2:49:50.300 --> 2:49:54.300]  chips a windshield so he tried with the hollow points the same
[2:49:54.300 --> 2:49:59.500]  results second test was uh shooting through the side door
[2:49:59.500 --> 2:50:04.780]  put the target there sideways uh between the seat and the door panel
[2:50:04.780 --> 2:50:08.140]  and it punches really nice holes in the side door
[2:50:08.140 --> 2:50:12.060]  but uh the shrapnel that came out the other side was like
[2:50:12.060 --> 2:50:15.740]  taking a piece of rice and cutting it lengthwise and about four or five pieces
[2:50:15.740 --> 2:50:19.660]  and yeah i had a range rifle from uh ruger
[2:50:19.660 --> 2:50:26.140]  and i would shoot washing machines in a 30 odd six 308 30 30 would shoot right
[2:50:26.140 --> 2:50:30.220]  through the washing machine all four layers the outer layer the inner layer
[2:50:30.220 --> 2:50:34.140]  the next inner layer and the outer layer and most of the two two threes
[2:50:34.140 --> 2:50:35.740]  wouldn't even make it all the way through
[2:50:35.740 --> 2:50:39.500]  but if they did it was just a little bit of shrapnel because the bullet turns
[2:50:39.500 --> 2:50:43.580]  it's very small it's a 22 caliber uh as you know
[2:50:43.580 --> 2:50:48.540]  and uh it's why you shoot 222 or 223 through that
[2:50:48.540 --> 2:50:54.220]  and uh it is really not a very good round unless it hits flesh it's very
[2:50:54.220 --> 2:50:57.180]  devastating when it actually hits flesh stay there we'll come back and see if
[2:50:57.180 --> 2:50:59.900]  you're going with this

[2:54:18.780 --> 2:54:24.140]  the atlanta journal constitution talk to witnesses
[2:54:24.140 --> 2:54:27.660]  republican senator dan patrick wrote on his twitter page that he wasn't in the
[2:54:27.660 --> 2:54:31.180]  office but his staff called security and told him this
[2:54:31.180 --> 2:54:37.020]  an individual came into my austin senate office today acting strangely
[2:54:37.020 --> 2:54:42.140]  staff called security moments later shots fired on capital steps he wrote
[2:54:42.140 --> 2:54:46.060]  so it looks like he came in something happened he ran out
[2:54:46.060 --> 2:54:49.820]  maybe he didn't want the police to arrest him and he shot it at the ground or
[2:54:49.820 --> 2:54:54.220]  something we're only speculating why didn't they kill him
[2:54:54.220 --> 2:54:58.460]  somebody comes around my office and starts shooting a gun trying to hurt
[2:54:58.460 --> 2:55:02.060]  people i'm not gonna talk to him i'm gonna kill him
[2:55:02.060 --> 2:55:07.900]  i mean i would expect the police draw down and shoot him don't talk to him
[2:55:07.900 --> 2:55:11.180]  see people always defend police when they shoot somebody who's unarmed in the
[2:55:11.180 --> 2:55:14.220]  back but then they get on police if they
[2:55:14.220 --> 2:55:17.500]  shoot somebody who's already got a gun look you got a gun and you're already
[2:55:17.500 --> 2:55:22.460]  shooting it i don't think anybody should wait you just need to shoot
[2:55:22.460 --> 2:55:25.580]  you know i always see these cases where somebody breaks in a business and the
[2:55:25.580 --> 2:55:28.860]  person says hands up i'm not going to say hands up
[2:55:28.860 --> 2:55:33.260]  if you've broken in i'm just going to shoot you and that's what the law says
[2:55:33.260 --> 2:55:36.300]  i should do but
[2:55:36.300 --> 2:55:43.340]  it goes on from there this is terrible going back
[2:55:43.340 --> 2:55:47.180]  to larry in texas says he's a sheriff's deputy
[2:55:47.180 --> 2:55:50.460]  warning people about how ineffective 223 is it's fired from
[2:55:50.460 --> 2:55:57.260]  the m16 ar-15 uh ruger range rifles the list goes on and on but separately from
[2:55:57.260 --> 2:56:00.140]  that i've tested it myself i know you're right
[2:56:00.140 --> 2:56:04.140]  people do need a heavier round why does our military use the 223
[2:56:04.140 --> 2:56:07.740]  because they did studies with the cult the original m16 and found
[2:56:07.740 --> 2:56:11.660]  that when it hits it changes directions i shot deer with the 223
[2:56:11.660 --> 2:56:14.860]  and as long as you shoot them 100 yards or closer
[2:56:14.860 --> 2:56:17.980]  the bullet doesn't even generally come out but it goes all over i don't like
[2:56:17.980 --> 2:56:21.500]  it because it messes up a lot of meat but i've shot deer with 223s and they
[2:56:21.500 --> 2:56:24.860]  always drop immediately whereas i shoot them with a 30 odd six or
[2:56:24.860 --> 2:56:29.020]  308 they tend to run 10 15 10 15 feet they got a big hole blown in them on the
[2:56:29.020 --> 2:56:32.860]  other side and the and the meat's a lot cleaner
[2:56:32.860 --> 2:56:36.460]  but the 223 man it just goes in and that bullet goes through bones everything
[2:56:36.460 --> 2:56:39.660]  else breaks into pieces same thing when you shoot
[2:56:39.660 --> 2:56:42.700]  a vehicle so i i agree with you it's not good for roadblocks but
[2:56:42.700 --> 2:56:46.380]  shepherd from that what do you think of this capital situation
[2:56:46.380 --> 2:56:51.100]  uh it sounds suspicious i mean what would you do if somebody if you were
[2:56:51.100 --> 2:56:54.860]  a capital uh state police officer and somebody's shooting a gun waving around
[2:56:54.860 --> 2:56:57.900]  i mean how did how did he survive this
[2:56:57.900 --> 2:57:04.540]  without even being shot i couldn't answer that i
[2:57:04.540 --> 2:57:08.380]  too bad they didn't take them out but that doesn't it sounds suspicious that
[2:57:08.380 --> 2:57:10.700]  they wouldn't i mean normal procedure if somebody's
[2:57:10.700 --> 2:57:15.260]  shooting a gun as you shoot them oh yeah neutralize
[2:57:15.260 --> 2:57:19.660]  um back to the last test we done with the 223 was uh
[2:57:19.660 --> 2:57:23.660]  if someone was in the brush and you're returning fire at someone hiding in the
[2:57:23.660 --> 2:57:28.060]  brush and we set the target behind the waist-high brush
[2:57:28.060 --> 2:57:32.460]  and left the head portion showing where you could gauge
[2:57:32.460 --> 2:57:36.620]  12 inches blowing and be able to shoot none of the rounds made it through the
[2:57:36.620 --> 2:57:41.420]  brush so uh if someone's in the weeds with the ghillie suit on
[2:57:41.420 --> 2:57:44.700]  shooting at you you're going to have a hard time trying to return with the
[2:57:44.700 --> 2:57:49.180]  223 um one other thing i want to pass on to you about
[2:57:49.180 --> 2:57:54.300]  rfid um i was listening to a computer show a guy that
[2:57:54.300 --> 2:57:58.300]  helped you with your computer and someone called in about the rfid
[2:57:58.300 --> 2:58:01.900]  and he said that there's a youtube i don't have a computer
[2:58:01.900 --> 2:58:09.420]  he said there's a youtube video that uh shows a situation where um these new
[2:58:09.420 --> 2:58:13.340]  passports have the rfid chip in them and they're coated by
[2:58:13.340 --> 2:58:18.540]  yeah and the guy drives around san francisco stealing people's passports
[2:58:18.540 --> 2:58:22.380]  this was a garbage can they had a bomb in it
[2:58:22.380 --> 2:58:27.020]  and numerous people were walking by it but as soon as an american went by it
[2:58:27.020 --> 2:58:31.260]  it blowed up now rfid are super bad really good
[2:58:31.260 --> 2:58:35.100]  points yeah it's that is a really good point you've
[2:58:35.100 --> 2:58:38.700]  got the passport on you it knows who you are it detonates really
[2:58:38.700 --> 2:58:41.180]  good point
[2:58:41.180 --> 2:58:50.700]  thank you for listening to gcm be sure to visit gcmlive.com today

[2:59:08.860 --> 2:59:13.580]  and they really are calling the shots i think it's incumbent upon all of us

[2:59:51.660 --> 3:00:03.180]  waging war on corruption alex jones on the gcm radio network
[3:00:03.180 --> 3:00:22.700]  we've got photos taken from on top an office building across the street as
[3:00:22.700 --> 3:00:29.020]  the reported alleged shooter uh was apprehended by police i i find it
[3:00:29.020 --> 3:00:34.780]  very suspicious like where's my fact sheets 24 year old right can i can i
[3:00:34.780 --> 3:00:39.980]  have that 24 year old male from houston
[3:00:39.980 --> 3:00:42.700]  we call the state police and got this information this is even out in the
[3:00:42.700 --> 3:00:46.220]  media yet this is from the spokeswoman
[3:00:46.220 --> 3:00:52.140]  lisa block i mean i find it very suspicious that you've got a guy on the
[3:00:52.140 --> 3:00:56.620]  steps of the capital crawling with armed state police waving a gun around
[3:00:56.620 --> 3:00:59.820]  shooting it and they didn't shoot him and that
[3:00:59.820 --> 3:01:03.100]  i guess they then said freeze while he's shooting a gun and then
[3:01:03.100 --> 3:01:06.700]  he put it down and they didn't shoot him
[3:01:09.340 --> 3:01:13.020]  i mean the cops half the time go and shoot homeowners they're so
[3:01:13.020 --> 3:01:16.540]  they're so trigger happy when they're investigating something and i mean i'm
[3:01:16.540 --> 3:01:19.420]  not saying they're bad when they do that but there's a lot of accidents that
[3:01:19.420 --> 3:01:22.220]  happened i know i know the dps is supposedly better
[3:01:22.220 --> 3:01:27.180]  train a lot of police departments but i don't understand how somebody is
[3:01:27.180 --> 3:01:30.620]  running around shooting five to six shots they're now saying
[3:01:30.620 --> 3:01:35.980]  and no one shoots him the scenario i start thinking about now according to
[3:01:35.980 --> 3:01:39.340]  the state senator who said he was in his office
[3:01:39.340 --> 3:01:42.300]  he was acting strangely left and then they heard shots so he's acting
[3:01:42.300 --> 3:01:46.380]  strangely maybe he had a concealed carry
[3:01:46.380 --> 3:01:49.980]  you're not supposed to have that in the capital they start grabbing on him
[3:01:49.980 --> 3:01:54.060]  it looks like a glock we there's an image of the state police
[3:01:54.060 --> 3:01:57.420]  and the state police wouldn't hold their own firearm plus it's not what the
[3:01:57.420 --> 3:02:01.340]  state police carry it looks like a small glock or one of the knockoffs of the
[3:02:01.340 --> 3:02:03.980]  plastic gun
[3:02:05.100 --> 3:02:08.540]  you know the capital doesn't have metal detectors in it you know they're just
[3:02:08.540 --> 3:02:11.180]  going to stick them in there as if that'll do anything i bet they're going to
[3:02:11.180 --> 3:02:13.580]  put naked body scanners in there and i bet this whole thing
[3:02:13.580 --> 3:02:18.380]  it's a dps intelligence operation but i don't know that
[3:02:18.380 --> 3:02:22.620]  but dps was marked as the worst in the country under coantel pro
[3:02:22.620 --> 3:02:26.860]  staging fake terror attacks and keeping list on citizens and they still do it
[3:02:26.860 --> 3:02:30.380]  but that came out in the 80s and they got barred from it blow up that photo for
[3:02:30.380 --> 3:02:33.900]  prisonplanet.tv viewers and send these photos over to curtain demo
[3:02:33.900 --> 3:02:38.140]  now that's the shot a better face shot of the alleged perpetrator let's blow that
[3:02:38.140 --> 3:02:40.700]  up first
[3:02:41.420 --> 3:02:45.900]  and then the other photo is of the gun
[3:02:45.900 --> 3:02:48.860]  now blow it up some more let's blow it right up to his face so everybody can
[3:02:48.860 --> 3:02:51.180]  see it
[3:02:51.420 --> 3:02:55.980]  where did you guys get these so people can go look at them for themselves
[3:02:55.980 --> 3:03:01.260]  this is kxan blow it up some more kxan.com
[3:03:01.260 --> 3:03:09.900]  yep that looks like a white male crew cut haircut white t-shirt blue jeans
[3:03:09.900 --> 3:03:13.660]  you got dps there with a bike cop okay go to the other photo
[3:03:13.660 --> 3:03:18.540]  now blow that up look at that firearm that is a Glock
[3:03:18.540 --> 3:03:21.740]  or one of the similar there's so many now that imitate the Glock
[3:03:21.740 --> 3:03:27.740]  that is one of the smaller little snub-nosed semi-automatic black
[3:03:27.740 --> 3:03:34.380]  uh composite column plastic they're really composite firearms
[3:03:34.380 --> 3:03:39.260]  that's what that is and it looks like the chamber is open
[3:03:39.260 --> 3:03:43.900]  so the slide the top of the firearm let's go back to that
[3:03:43.900 --> 3:03:47.260]  is open see how it's sticking out further past the handle
[3:03:47.260 --> 3:03:50.700]  and the police officer is holding it by the barrel
[3:03:50.700 --> 3:03:54.460]  that's not how he would hold his own firearm it'd be in his hand
[3:03:54.460 --> 3:03:58.060]  and i believe he does have it he does have a
[3:03:58.140 --> 3:04:05.660]  yeah he's got a shotgun in his right hand a black semi-auto shotgun
[3:04:05.660 --> 3:04:09.900]  he's got a riot shotgun in one hand and he and and i'll guarantee you that
[3:04:09.900 --> 3:04:12.060]  officer's not going to be holding a firearm
[3:04:12.060 --> 3:04:15.420]  that way unless he had just grabbed it up off the ground and these photos
[3:04:15.420 --> 3:04:19.100]  they report were just seconds after they apprehended him
[3:04:19.100 --> 3:04:26.220]  so did he fire the shots to scare people and then put it back in his
[3:04:26.220 --> 3:04:30.700]  belt buckle and and then run that's the only way they wouldn't have killed him
[3:04:30.700 --> 3:04:34.940]  if it is or at least shot him if this wasn't staged
[3:04:34.940 --> 3:04:38.220]  so we're trying to work the different angles of this
[3:04:38.220 --> 3:04:42.220]  could it be suspicious yes or could it be just a lunatic
[3:04:42.220 --> 3:04:46.700]  yes but i'll guarantee you this there aren't any police in the planet where
[3:04:46.700 --> 3:04:51.740]  somebody's on the steps of the capital with a gun firing shots
[3:04:51.740 --> 3:04:54.300]  they're not going to sit there and say drop the gun drop the gun they're
[3:04:54.300 --> 3:04:56.780]  going to shoot them
[3:04:56.780 --> 3:05:03.500]  well they're right back one major world crisis away from
[3:05:03.500 --> 3:05:08.140]  having a totalitarian type of system the main event is the the wholesale
[3:05:08.140 --> 3:05:11.420]  destruction of the world to push for every nation on the globe

[3:08:28.540 --> 3:08:32.220]  welcome yes thank you yeah it's a scary what's going on at the capital right
[3:08:32.220 --> 3:08:37.900]  now oh it certainly is it certainly is i mean it is
[3:08:37.900 --> 3:08:40.860]  what do you think of what's happening to talk about something else that went down
[3:08:40.860 --> 3:08:43.580]  at the capital on uh... january 16th
[3:08:43.580 --> 3:08:48.780]  um... the nullification rally and the events that ensued after that
[3:08:48.780 --> 3:08:51.420]  which i caught on film is up on my youtube channel
[3:08:51.420 --> 3:08:53.900]  tell us about the rally tell them what happened
[3:08:53.900 --> 3:08:58.300]  okay well i had come there just to support nullification
[3:08:58.300 --> 3:09:02.700]  and i had no idea that there would be so many deborah medina supporters there
[3:09:02.700 --> 3:09:06.300]  uh... i mean it made up basically the entire crowd
[3:09:06.300 --> 3:09:10.780]  and supposedly uh... they were under the impression that she was going to speak
[3:09:10.780 --> 3:09:14.300]  that day and near the end of the rally the
[3:09:14.300 --> 3:09:17.260]  crowd started getting a little bit boisterous about it and we're saying
[3:09:17.260 --> 3:09:20.380]  where's deborah why isn't she allowed to speak
[3:09:20.380 --> 3:09:23.740]  well she never got to get up there and speak so
[3:09:23.740 --> 3:09:28.540]  what i filmed was um it was just a flight confrontation it was it was really
[3:09:28.540 --> 3:09:33.020]  more of a discussion but it was kind of a you know just an argument between
[3:09:33.020 --> 3:09:37.500]  one of the medina supporters wondering why she wasn't allowed to speak
[3:09:37.500 --> 3:09:41.180]  and then uh... one of the people that was putting the rally on
[3:09:41.180 --> 3:09:45.100]  and then i don't know if you've got to fill people in deborah medina is the
[3:09:45.100 --> 3:09:49.340]  one of the republican candidates uh... for governors he's surging in the polls
[3:09:49.340 --> 3:09:52.620]  against rick perry i mean she's coming from way behind
[3:09:52.620 --> 3:09:56.460]  rick perry and kabeli hutchinson tell people what the nullification rally was
[3:09:56.460 --> 3:09:59.020]  for you'll let people know
[3:09:59.020 --> 3:10:03.180]  yeah and uh... anyway so nullification of what
[3:10:03.180 --> 3:10:09.100]  nullification of the health care bill yes but but really i mean any bill
[3:10:09.100 --> 3:10:12.460]  uh... that could come you know the congressman passes that and deborah
[3:10:12.460 --> 3:10:16.380]  medina was there and wasn't allowed to speak she was there
[3:10:16.380 --> 3:10:20.460]  uh... and uh... wasn't on the invited list
[3:10:20.460 --> 3:10:24.140]  from all the research that i've been able to do i i know she wasn't on the list
[3:10:24.140 --> 3:10:28.940]  officially but what i think was a little miscommunication between the
[3:10:28.940 --> 3:10:33.020]  person that had the permit and then the people that were putting on the rally
[3:10:33.020 --> 3:10:37.420]  um... supposedly i don't i've got to look up at the the code
[3:10:37.420 --> 3:10:41.180]  well that's in the past we can move forward now what else is on your mind
[3:10:41.180 --> 3:10:45.340]  sure so anyway um... you know basically i interviewed a lot of people

[3:10:48.220 --> 3:10:52.140]  her and she wasn't allowed to speak and so now articles are coming out
[3:10:52.140 --> 3:10:57.020]  uh... there's a blog up on wordpress and author civil west and she's basically
[3:10:57.020 --> 3:11:00.460]  saying that deborah medina supporters are

[3:11:10.620 --> 3:11:15.660]  uh... supporting her for governor and so

[3:11:39.980 --> 3:11:43.660]  and i wondered if you have any inner information about uh...
[3:11:43.660 --> 3:11:49.340]  the government uh... taking human fat and turning it into a bio diesel
[3:11:49.340 --> 3:11:54.060]  haha i'm no i don't i know in the movie fight club they take human fat and turn

[3:12:02.620 --> 3:12:05.820]  around the world but no i don't know anything about turning human fat into
[3:12:05.820 --> 3:12:10.380]  bio diesel johnny i was just wondering

[3:12:24.780 --> 3:12:28.780]  garden that's right you're a mayor says that's uh...
[3:12:28.780 --> 3:12:32.460]  evil that's right you might grow marijuana
[3:12:32.460 --> 3:12:35.500]  you might grow marijuana so we need to restrict you being able to have a
[3:12:35.500 --> 3:12:38.300]  garden you can't let you can't let prisoners have their own
[3:12:38.300 --> 3:12:41.500]  gardens no
[3:12:41.500 --> 3:12:45.180]  well the reason for my call today i wanted to tell you that i listened to a
[3:12:45.180 --> 3:12:47.740]  little bit of glen beck this morning
[3:12:47.740 --> 3:12:51.820]  and as if we needed any more proof that he's trying to become you
[3:12:51.820 --> 3:12:57.340]  he said that he's going into the documentary filmmaking business
[3:12:57.340 --> 3:13:01.180]  you're joking no i'm not second hour
[3:13:01.180 --> 3:13:05.580]  about the first it was the first half of the second hour
[3:13:05.580 --> 3:13:08.700]  any he didn't really he said i can't really say much about it but it's going
[3:13:08.700 --> 3:13:12.380]  to be really big well good for him it'll be in
[3:13:12.380 --> 3:13:16.060]  theaters will be bigger than michael more it'll be a fake right wing view of the
[3:13:16.060 --> 3:13:19.580]  world like what we have with
[3:13:19.580 --> 3:13:23.260]  michael more giving you a left-wing rebel view
[3:13:23.260 --> 3:13:26.700]  uh... and that's just how they operate but the truth will continue to smash
[3:13:26.700 --> 3:13:30.620]  their propaganda right that's right i'm so glad that you're
[3:13:30.620 --> 3:13:34.540]  gonna go after him i agree with you a hundred percent i think he is just an
[3:13:34.540 --> 3:13:39.180]  absolute he's just a demon
[3:13:41.340 --> 3:13:44.940]  well every time i tune in and i i didn't do it this morning i turned it on
[3:13:44.940 --> 3:13:47.980]  driving into work and i just i can't listen i had to turn it off
[3:13:47.980 --> 3:13:51.420]  because of just how disingenuous and manipulative he is and how obvious it
[3:13:51.420 --> 3:13:56.460]  is to me it's hard to listen to and uh...
[3:13:56.460 --> 3:14:00.060]  we'll just see what happens but no left right paradigm
[3:14:00.060 --> 3:14:04.540]  i mean he literally when i listen it's like oh my gosh
[3:14:04.540 --> 3:14:07.500]  he's expropriated so much of what we do and then
[3:14:07.500 --> 3:14:10.780]  always days after we cover something he then covers it
[3:14:10.780 --> 3:14:14.380]  but then puts his spin on it and to watch my work
[3:14:14.380 --> 3:14:18.460]  turned into what he's doing with it but you know what in the end it'll just
[3:14:18.460 --> 3:14:22.460]  turn out good because he will wake up a mainstream audience
[3:14:22.460 --> 3:14:25.340]  they'll then find out what's going on and they'll find out
[3:14:25.340 --> 3:14:29.900]  the the full story but i appreciate your call
[3:14:29.900 --> 3:14:33.900]  we're getting a lot of emails like this my feeling is
[3:14:33.900 --> 3:14:37.100]  that this shooting at the texas state building this morning
[3:14:37.100 --> 3:14:40.780]  is a direct staged event in response to the closing of the gun show
[3:14:40.780 --> 3:14:44.540]  you watch he will have gotten his weapon at the gun show
[3:14:44.540 --> 3:14:50.860]  see ya we gotta close the gun shows keep them up
[3:14:50.860 --> 3:14:54.700]  d francis i don't know
[3:14:56.620 --> 3:15:01.100]  it may be that he was some concealed carry guy
[3:15:02.380 --> 3:15:05.260]  who came in and said something threatening at the senator's office they
[3:15:05.260 --> 3:15:09.740]  said he was acting strangely and then they tried to grab him and it's a
[3:15:09.740 --> 3:15:12.620]  semi-auto and it went off or something i mean
[3:15:12.620 --> 3:15:15.420]  who knows we don't know yet we'll find out soon
[3:15:15.420 --> 3:15:19.740]  we'll have articles and info wars dot com and prison planet dot com
[3:15:19.740 --> 3:15:24.460]  uh... the break that down uh... let's go ahead and talk to peter in canada
[3:15:24.460 --> 3:15:28.060]  peter you're on the air hey alex nice to talk to you
[3:15:28.060 --> 3:15:31.580]  to talk to you i've i've got two questions on two uh... different issues
[3:15:31.580 --> 3:15:35.500]  here the first one is uh... debba medina i heard her speak uh... on the debate
[3:15:35.500 --> 3:15:39.180]  last week and i was quite impressed are you gonna have her on your show
[3:15:39.180 --> 3:15:42.540]  yeah she's in here well i'll win next week
[3:15:42.540 --> 3:15:47.660]  she's in studio next week on a one day okay i'll be waiting to uh... waiting to
[3:15:47.660 --> 3:15:51.420]  listen to that one another one i've been listening to you for a year now and i
[3:15:51.420 --> 3:15:55.020]  agree with what ninety five percent of uh... of what you say but one thing
[3:15:55.020 --> 3:16:00.140]  uh... on peak oil you know the u.s. is in iraq seemingly for the oil and now
[3:16:00.140 --> 3:16:03.740]  they're in afghanistan pakistan to block pipelines to china
[3:16:03.740 --> 3:16:07.820]  why would they be doing that if peak oil was a hoax and all made up
[3:16:07.820 --> 3:16:11.500]  well that's a very easy way to answer that
[3:16:11.500 --> 3:16:15.260]  uh... it's confirmed that there's more oil discovered
[3:16:15.260 --> 3:16:19.420]  proven reserves in alaska than there is in saudi arabia
[3:16:19.420 --> 3:16:24.780]  on one area uh... one small field uh... there is enough to run the country for
[3:16:24.780 --> 3:16:28.940]  another fifty years but they will not allow those pipelines to be brought in
[3:16:28.940 --> 3:16:32.940]  because it's artificial scarcity there's too much oil
[3:16:32.940 --> 3:16:37.660]  there's too much natural gas and so that if they don't shut down large sectors of
[3:16:37.660 --> 3:16:41.660]  the gulf of mexico and alaska and other areas
[3:16:41.660 --> 3:16:47.420]  then they won't be able to have their huge profits they don't want china
[3:16:47.420 --> 3:16:51.340]  and other countries to have their own cheap oil they want them to have to buy
[3:16:51.340 --> 3:16:56.140]  it from western oil companies and so it's just like to beers
[3:16:56.140 --> 3:16:58.780]  uh... you know if there's so many diamonds in the world why are they so
[3:16:58.780 --> 3:17:02.460]  expensive because the beers owned by the openheimers
[3:17:02.460 --> 3:17:07.020]  and others a big consortium they have a world diamond monopoly that's a fact
[3:17:07.020 --> 3:17:11.100]  sir uh... and so they're trying to make sure that they can make
[3:17:11.100 --> 3:17:17.660]  oil more scarce oil in alaska is proven where can i go to see this proof
[3:17:17.660 --> 3:17:21.020]  uh... it's it's so voluminous it's completely insane that they've only
[3:17:21.020 --> 3:17:24.940]  allowed one uh... small area there on the west slope
[3:17:24.940 --> 3:17:28.620]  to be opened a few other areas the oil companies admit they could build more
[3:17:28.620 --> 3:17:31.420]  than ten pipelines the size of the one they have
[3:17:31.420 --> 3:17:34.700]  that already supplies what is it fourteen percent of u.s
[3:17:34.700 --> 3:17:37.900]  uh... needs on the west coast of the rest of its sold
[3:17:37.900 --> 3:17:40.540]  that they pumped to the japanese and chinese
[3:17:40.540 --> 3:17:44.540]  uh... i mean it's just it's common knowledge it's admitted everywhere there
[3:17:44.540 --> 3:17:48.140]  there's an oil field six hundred and forty square miles
[3:17:48.140 --> 3:17:52.380]  right off of louisiana mississippi uh... that's just everywhere you drill you
[3:17:52.380 --> 3:17:53.180]  hit oil
[3:17:53.180 --> 3:17:56.900]  everywhere you drill you hit oil sir uh... in that area
[3:17:56.900 --> 3:17:59.500]  getting back to deborah medina do you think she has a chance at winning that
[3:17:59.500 --> 3:18:02.820]  governorship
[3:18:02.820 --> 3:18:06.660]  if the mainstream media covered or more and said she could win yes and and she
[3:18:06.660 --> 3:18:09.620]  is rising in the polls and
[3:18:09.620 --> 3:18:11.820]  patriots other people
[3:18:11.820 --> 3:18:13.900]  uh... out there
[3:18:13.900 --> 3:18:18.380]  uh... need to run at their different state levels for similar positions
[3:18:18.380 --> 3:18:20.060]  it's showing people
[3:18:20.060 --> 3:18:23.740]  just like what we just saw in massachusetts that if you start early enough
[3:18:23.740 --> 3:18:25.340]  you can basically beat
[3:18:25.340 --> 3:18:31.940]  any big incumbent people aren't just mad at democrats they're mad at incumbents
[3:18:31.940 --> 3:18:32.740]  uh...

[3:24:23.060 --> 3:24:31.580]  he says abolish the CIA he said we need to get rid of it we need to take it out
[3:24:31.580 --> 3:24:37.100]  back what's the actual actual quote you know what let's just play Ron Paul's
[3:24:37.100 --> 3:24:42.860]  quote again right now instead of me just sitting here and paraphrasing it this is
[3:24:42.860 --> 3:24:46.660]  Ron Paul this week at the campaign for liberty one of the regional rallies and
[3:24:46.660 --> 3:24:52.100]  here he is saying we need to abolish and get rid of the CIA they've had a coup over
[3:24:52.100 --> 3:24:56.860]  our government and they have Republicans and Democrats come and go but
[3:24:56.860 --> 3:25:02.820]  the CIA stays in power it's the shadow government it's a big part of the shadow
[3:25:02.820 --> 3:25:07.500]  government he goes on to say get rid of it this is courage here's Ron Paul I
[3:25:07.500 --> 3:25:12.140]  mean but they're they're almost like they live in a different world the
[3:25:12.140 --> 3:25:16.060]  military's down the brown is down the money is an area going looking for a
[3:25:16.060 --> 3:25:21.380]  couple more wars to fight it makes no sense whatsoever but no we don't have to
[3:25:21.380 --> 3:25:26.420]  worry about the military anymore because it's there's been a coup have you
[3:25:26.420 --> 3:25:31.940]  heard it's the CIA the CIA runs everything they run the military they're the
[3:25:31.940 --> 3:25:37.020]  ones who are over there lobbing missiles and bombs on these countries it's not
[3:25:37.020 --> 3:25:41.820]  even the military that does that the CIA runs this and of course the CIA has
[3:25:41.820 --> 3:25:47.980]  ever been as secret as the Federal Reserve and yet think of the harm that
[3:25:47.980 --> 3:25:51.860]  they have done since they were established in since World War two they
[3:25:51.860 --> 3:25:55.500]  are a government under themselves they're in businesses they're in drug
[3:25:55.500 --> 3:26:08.660]  businesses and is that not powerful that's congressman Ron Paul you can go
[3:26:08.660 --> 3:26:15.740]  watch the video at prisonplanet.com and info wars.com in fact I'm trying to give
[3:26:15.740 --> 3:26:20.300]  you the exact headline it's lost somewhere here in my stack if you want to
[3:26:20.300 --> 3:26:25.820]  go watch that video my guys are writing so many articles and posting so much
[3:26:25.820 --> 3:26:33.060]  that here it is Ron Paul the CIA runs everything that's a quote from Ron Paul
[3:26:33.060 --> 3:26:39.060]  and you can watch that video and you can read the article that Curtin Emo put
[3:26:39.060 --> 3:26:46.180]  together at info wars.com and then we fished out another clip from documentary
[3:26:46.180 --> 3:26:50.620]  filmmakers here in Austin Texas that Tommy Pallotta worked on in late 1980s
[3:26:50.620 --> 3:26:56.220]  interviewing Ron Paul where he's talking about the CIA drug dealing and
[3:26:56.220 --> 3:27:00.820]  George Bush senior drug dealing now that's powerful info and you notice the
[3:27:00.820 --> 3:27:03.940]  media knew about these clips during the campaign they didn't want to go after
[3:27:03.940 --> 3:27:10.580]  Ron Paul on that because the CIA solicitor inspector general found in 1996
[3:27:10.580 --> 3:27:13.900]  that they were running in most the narcotics into the country this is an
[3:27:13.900 --> 3:27:19.260]  open secret just like it's an open secret that illegal aliens are above the law
[3:27:19.260 --> 3:27:23.820]  as you know that all over the country and almost every major city over 800
[3:27:23.820 --> 3:27:28.940]  cities illegals don't get DWI's they don't get speeding tickets they don't get
[3:27:28.940 --> 3:27:33.220]  arrested for not having a driver's license citizens do and I talked to some
[3:27:33.220 --> 3:27:37.180]  of the Hispanic lobbying groups and they say well that's okay everybody else
[3:27:37.180 --> 3:27:41.140]  gets arrested but illegals you're a racist if you are for you having the
[3:27:41.140 --> 3:27:47.860]  same rights I mean America is a joke ladies and gentlemen the Austin police
[3:27:47.860 --> 3:27:51.660]  department can shut down illegal gun show because they say so without a law but
[3:27:51.660 --> 3:27:59.100]  illegal aliens are above the law this is a sick joke this is a sick joke and the
[3:27:59.100 --> 3:28:02.260]  government set the precedent they're now giving matriculas out not just to
[3:28:02.260 --> 3:28:05.860]  Mexicans but the Mexican government pioneered this and made payoffs to people
[3:28:05.860 --> 3:28:10.220]  illegally in government to do it now all these other countries Poland's issuing
[3:28:10.220 --> 3:28:15.540]  their own card Russia's doing it Venezuela Nicaragua Salvador they're all
[3:28:15.540 --> 3:28:19.580]  issuing them so you don't have any rights if you're a citizen but you don't
[3:28:19.580 --> 3:28:25.900]  just have rights you're above the law if you're a fire because the government
[3:28:25.900 --> 3:28:29.780]  wants to give welfare and grease the skids for foreigners to come here to
[3:28:29.780 --> 3:28:33.620]  make them a political weapon against the republic to remove the middle class
[3:28:33.620 --> 3:28:38.660]  and the bank rep the nation for the banks the country is imploding in to
[3:28:38.660 --> 3:28:44.980]  tyranny it's falling apart and again I was talking to one of my employees who
[3:28:44.980 --> 3:28:49.660]  formerly a few years ago worked at the city of Austin in gas and power and he
[3:28:49.660 --> 3:28:54.140]  said more than 90% of the illegals don't pay their bills and they just have
[3:28:54.140 --> 3:28:57.580]  another illegal come in six months later when they get their gas turned off
[3:28:57.580 --> 3:29:02.020]  to start a new matricula card and they they're ordered you will give them free
[3:29:02.020 --> 3:29:09.060]  power you will give them free gas this is what we've been told to do and again
[3:29:09.060 --> 3:29:19.860]  just the illustration of how lawless government is how lawless they've become
[3:29:19.860 --> 3:29:29.500]  we're gonna come back blitz through a bunch of news and then go to your phone

[3:33:26.660 --> 3:33:30.060]  I did tune in to Glenn Beck for about a minute this morning and I had to turn it
[3:33:30.060 --> 3:33:32.500]  off I just couldn't listen to his voice and I was getting a cell phone call in
[3:33:32.500 --> 3:33:42.640]  my car and I did hear him making fun of you know the Democrats big documentary
[3:33:42.640 --> 3:33:53.220]  filmmaker and saying we'll see how the maker of Fahrenheit 9-11 Michael Moore
[3:33:53.220 --> 3:33:57.100]  likes what I'm gonna do and the caller said he says he's gonna make
[3:33:57.100 --> 3:34:03.180]  documentaries now that may not be copying me but him using all my terms
[3:34:03.180 --> 3:34:10.380]  and then twisting and around is and remember a year ago Fox launched this
[3:34:10.380 --> 3:34:18.020]  website Fox Nation that just looks just like prison planet calm and info wars
[3:34:18.020 --> 3:34:22.780]  calm and runs the same kind of news see they want the Patriot Libertarian
[3:34:22.780 --> 3:34:30.300]  audience but they don't want it for their main Fox audience and so there was an
[3:34:30.300 --> 3:34:35.700]  info wars calm article about how Fox launches a clone in fact post that
[3:34:35.700 --> 3:34:46.420]  article if you can the original article that we wrote about that but that's the
[3:34:46.420 --> 3:34:50.980]  type of information Fox launches info wars calm clone website attempt to
[3:34:50.980 --> 3:34:56.380]  cannibalize the Patriot movement and that was written back in April of 2009 and
[3:34:56.380 --> 3:35:00.340]  they've now taken over much of the Patriot movement and are misdirecting
[3:35:00.340 --> 3:35:08.220]  it into pro-war pro-patriot act new taxes as the answer to Obama and again
[3:35:08.220 --> 3:35:11.500]  that's why we've got a counter I've kind of ignored it I've tried to be
[3:35:11.500 --> 3:35:17.540]  somewhat friendly they've tried to do olive branches and Fox has plugged us a
[3:35:17.540 --> 3:35:24.700]  lot and had me on the Palatino show and then a few little things like that but
[3:35:24.700 --> 3:35:29.420]  I just I just don't want to be invited to the party I mean just makes me sick
[3:35:29.420 --> 3:35:34.660]  even thinking about it I don't want to be on Fox news I don't want to be with
[3:35:34.660 --> 3:35:38.300]  them I don't want to go say the Muslims want to kill us give up all your rights
[3:35:38.300 --> 3:35:41.460]  al-Qaeda is going to get you I just I don't even want to do this anymore I'm
[3:35:41.460 --> 3:35:45.900]  just sick of it and yes Glenn back is going to make quote underground
[3:35:45.900 --> 3:35:50.460]  documentaries of course he is they know my films are devastating them they're
[3:35:50.460 --> 3:35:54.340]  exposing left-right paradigm that's why it's so important that all of you get
[3:35:54.340 --> 3:35:58.740]  fall the Republic and the Obama deception and make copies of the DVD and
[3:35:58.740 --> 3:36:02.860]  never stop giving amount because it exposes them all you could show fall
[3:36:02.860 --> 3:36:07.220]  the Republic or the Obama deception to a liberal or a conservative and it breaks
[3:36:07.220 --> 3:36:11.180]  their paradigm and the game's over and if we could get this out everybody that
[3:36:11.180 --> 3:36:20.500]  would indeed happen
[3:36:20.940 --> 3:36:31.820]  now a lot of people were excited today to hear that the Supreme Court had ruled
[3:36:31.820 --> 3:36:44.300]  against the First Amendment violations that are involved in the McCain fine
[3:36:44.300 --> 3:36:49.620]  gold campaign finance reform of now eight years ago I'm actually looking for my
[3:36:49.620 --> 3:36:54.980]  articles I had a whole bunch of them here here it is Supreme Court removes
[3:36:54.980 --> 3:37:01.380]  limits on corporate labor donations to campaigns and I read the ruling all it
[3:37:01.380 --> 3:37:05.860]  does is take the restrictions off of labor unions and big corporations to
[3:37:05.860 --> 3:37:12.380]  give money six weeks before an election but it left the changes in there where
[3:37:12.380 --> 3:37:19.740]  citizens are limited how much private money they can give and so the original
[3:37:19.740 --> 3:37:23.700]  restriction double the amount of money corporations could give but put limits
[3:37:23.700 --> 3:37:29.380]  on how close to a campaign they could do it now and I've got to read the full
[3:37:29.380 --> 3:37:35.100]  ruling I tried to this morning scan over it but there's no mention anywhere
[3:37:35.100 --> 3:37:39.460]  here and obviously it was unconstitutional to say Hillary the movie
[3:37:39.460 --> 3:37:45.900]  couldn't even show in theaters before an election back during the election
[3:37:45.900 --> 3:37:49.380]  courts tried to rule that I mean obviously you can make a documentary
[3:37:49.380 --> 3:37:53.860]  about Hillary Clinton as free speech and show it and no campaign rule can do
[3:37:53.860 --> 3:37:59.380]  that so the good news is it it threw that out but it's left and no one's
[3:37:59.380 --> 3:38:04.660]  talking about that the restrictions on I can only give what is it three thousand
[3:38:04.660 --> 3:38:14.340]  dollars to Ron Paul and I'm done as an individual so but I guess individuals
[3:38:14.340 --> 3:38:18.700]  need to sue now so that they give their rights to give because now if labor
[3:38:18.700 --> 3:38:22.580]  unions and corporations can give unlimited but citizens can't we're in
[3:38:22.580 --> 3:38:26.980]  trouble so it's good in that it defend some of the first amendment but it's
[3:38:26.980 --> 3:38:31.940]  unequal it's like Obama's health care plan saying certain states and labor
[3:38:31.940 --> 3:38:37.140]  unions are exempt from the taxes on health care plans I mean you can't do
[3:38:37.140 --> 3:38:41.500]  that just like Obama said if you're a democratic contributor you get to keep
[3:38:41.500 --> 3:38:47.380]  your 90 year old or 70 year old some of the cases car dealership but if you're
[3:38:47.380 --> 3:38:50.780]  not we're taking it because the government runs GM I mean that really
[3:38:50.780 --> 3:38:54.340]  happened I mean this is so lawless
[3:38:58.180 --> 3:39:02.540]  I just can't believe that this is all going on and that these people are
[3:39:02.540 --> 3:39:05.820]  actually getting away with this I'm gonna get into some of the other good

[3:39:24.980 --> 3:39:33.860]  actually drowning in it this is one week of news last Sunday I came in here and
[3:39:33.860 --> 3:39:39.540]  cleaned off my desk and every one of these stories is just a nightmare of
[3:39:39.540 --> 3:39:43.340]  evil a nightmare of government corruption
[3:39:43.340 --> 3:39:52.380]  oh I am gonna take a few days off every once in a while I get really tired when
[3:39:52.380 --> 3:39:58.580]  I get emotionally spent I'm freaked out about all the work we've done and now

[3:40:28.540 --> 3:40:34.300]  political ideology Eroll Souther's had faced fierce opposition Republicans
[3:40:34.300 --> 3:40:38.980]  ever since news surfaced that he may have misled Congress about an incident in
[3:40:38.980 --> 3:40:44.700]  late 80s involving a background check of his boyfriend's ex of the boyfriend of
[3:40:44.700 --> 3:40:51.580]  his ex-wife I mean yeah they use these databases to harass people but the real
[3:40:51.580 --> 3:40:55.740]  reason he got in trouble is he gave video interviews saying the number one
[3:40:55.740 --> 3:40:59.620]  enemy of America is Christians and that's the number one terror threat we
[3:40:59.620 --> 3:41:04.340]  played that in the last few weeks so you know the good news is this guy won't have
[3:41:04.340 --> 3:41:09.540]  access to your wife's naked body I mean he likes access to data illegally so God
[3:41:09.540 --> 3:41:14.740]  knows what he'll do with the naked body scanners here's Beck Parrots White House
[3:41:14.740 --> 3:41:18.700]  informations are talking points Kurt Nemo that's a key story you need to read
[3:41:18.700 --> 3:41:25.780]  that H1N1 swine flu hoax falls apart at the seams it's openly coming out that
[3:41:25.780 --> 3:41:31.100]  it's a criminal operation that they're doing a criminal inquiry in the EU let
[3:41:31.100 --> 3:41:34.420]  me let me read some of this I mean here's an article from Steve Watson about
[3:41:34.420 --> 3:41:39.260]  it on Tuesday and then there's another great article we got up at info wars
[3:41:39.260 --> 3:41:43.300]  dot com by Mike Adams a natural news
[3:41:43.980 --> 3:41:50.500]  international hearings begin on falsified swine flu pandemic the
[3:41:50.500 --> 3:41:54.820]  Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe 47 member body encompassing
[3:41:54.820 --> 3:41:58.100]  democratically elected members of the parliament has begun hearings to
[3:41:58.100 --> 3:42:02.620]  investigate whether H1N1 swine flu pandemic was falsified or exaggerated
[3:42:02.620 --> 3:42:07.940]  in attempt for the profit the vaccine sales and then it's got the director of
[3:42:07.940 --> 3:42:13.540]  its saying it was all hype it was a lie it was a fraud the vaccine is dangerous
[3:42:13.540 --> 3:42:18.180]  I mean it sounds like Alex Jones runs that Council of Europe in order to
[3:42:18.180 --> 3:42:22.700]  promote their patented drugs and vaccines against flu pharmaceutical
[3:42:22.700 --> 3:42:26.180]  companies influence scientists and official agencies responsible for
[3:42:26.180 --> 3:42:30.620]  public health standards to alarm governments worldwide and make them
[3:42:30.620 --> 3:42:35.140]  squander tight health resources for insufficient vaccine strategies and
[3:42:35.140 --> 3:42:38.740]  needless exposed millions of healthy people to the risk of an unknown amount
[3:42:38.740 --> 3:42:43.780]  of side effects of insufficiently tested vaccines this is the Council of Europe
[3:42:43.780 --> 3:42:47.940]  speaking the bird flu campaign of 2005 2006 combined with the swine flu
[3:42:47.940 --> 3:42:51.660]  campaign seem to have caused a great deal of damage not only to the some
[3:42:51.660 --> 3:42:56.100]  vaccinated patients and to some health budgets but the credibility of the
[3:42:56.100 --> 3:43:00.980]  accountability of the important international health agencies who's
[3:43:00.980 --> 3:43:08.260]  reporting this the EU health board out of Strasburg who else is reporting this
[3:43:08.260 --> 3:43:15.980]  Fox News associated press Reuters washed in post I mean look at this I like Mike
[3:43:15.980 --> 3:43:19.180]  Adams articles they're like info wars articles he's gracious to let us post
[3:43:19.180 --> 3:43:25.060]  him in full but natural news comms the main site because just every paragraph
[3:43:25.060 --> 3:43:29.860]  is multiple links to all the mainstream news and documents and drug inserts and
[3:43:29.860 --> 3:43:37.860]  I mean here it is washed in post CDC Reuters Fox News so I mean when you give
[3:43:37.860 --> 3:43:42.580]  somebody these articles by Steve Watson or by Mike Adams let's get Mike Adams
[3:43:42.580 --> 3:43:50.220]  on next week let's get him on to talk about this in hindsight so when
[3:43:50.220 --> 3:43:53.580]  somebody says how dare you you got to take the shot you should be arrested if
[3:43:53.580 --> 3:43:56.340]  you don't take the shot you should be sued if you don't take it like Dr.
[3:43:56.340 --> 3:44:00.180]  Dean Adele said that guy gets up there on the radio every time I hear him
[3:44:00.180 --> 3:44:04.740]  because he comes on before me on the weekend on kale BJ I listen to him and
[3:44:04.740 --> 3:44:08.580]  he says there are no side effects it's all a lie you need to be arrested if you
[3:44:08.580 --> 3:44:14.140]  don't take it well I mean here it is admitted I mean the the the British in
[3:44:14.140 --> 3:44:18.940]  German and other governments they wouldn't even take it themselves it does
[3:44:18.940 --> 3:44:22.020]  brain damage you it does cause neurological disorders it does cause
[3:44:22.020 --> 3:44:27.860]  Guillain-Barré it does do all of this it does in many cases reduce fertility or
[3:44:27.860 --> 3:44:32.300]  outright sterilize you it does cause autoimmune disorders it's a fact folks

[3:44:36.660 --> 3:44:40.700]  you the truth about Glenn Beck I mean I do the research this is all I do I'm
[3:44:40.700 --> 3:44:43.740]  obsessed with it too much
[3:44:46.740 --> 3:44:50.660]  and I think about the fact that they were still able to shut down so many
[3:44:50.660 --> 3:44:54.580]  people I think about the fact they were still able to con so many people I think
[3:44:54.580 --> 3:44:59.180]  about the fact that so many women and I know you printed it again printed it for
[3:44:59.180 --> 3:45:03.140]  me I can't find it the stack all the mainstream news articles about all the
[3:45:03.140 --> 3:45:07.300]  unexpected miscarriages from the shot that's being talked about in the
[3:45:07.300 --> 3:45:11.620]  investigation and notice in the major EU investigation because their doctors
[3:45:11.620 --> 3:45:16.780]  aren't corrupt bureaucrats I'm sure they'll all be fired now they're talking
[3:45:16.780 --> 3:45:24.340]  about the campaign of 2005 2006 they did test up until 2008 where more than 30
[3:45:24.340 --> 3:45:28.260]  percent of the people that took the experimental bird flu shot would die
[3:45:28.260 --> 3:45:32.780]  that's London Telegraph I mean they're giving a hundred homeless people the
[3:45:32.780 --> 3:45:41.700]  shot and 31 are dying the government knows it they know them on Santo corn

[3:45:50.100 --> 3:45:58.300]  this to people why do I get called a conspiracy theorist when all I do is the
[3:45:58.300 --> 3:46:05.260]  research why do I have to be enemies with the police you're just like me you
[3:46:05.260 --> 3:46:10.620]  put your pants on one leg at a time you've got children these varieties of

[3:46:18.540 --> 3:46:22.700]  specifically going in there and changing the chemical composition to

[3:47:09.540 --> 3:47:24.060]  everything we do gets like alchemy they turned the gold into crap and I just
[3:47:24.060 --> 3:47:28.980]  wish that Glenn Beck would not be a sniveling little trader he knows what
[3:47:28.980 --> 3:47:34.580]  he's doing folks you got to tell Glenn Beck we are not gonna have a national
[3:47:34.580 --> 3:47:40.380]  sales tax and we know the feds don't plan to replace the income tax with it I
[3:47:40.380 --> 3:47:44.220]  told you this for over 10 years they were planning this it's all now happening

[3:47:49.780 --> 3:47:53.820]  they are now coming into power you watch they are going to say we've got to have
[3:47:53.820 --> 3:47:58.140]  taxes to pay these bankers off they're pushing new taxing systems and anybody
[3:47:58.140 --> 3:48:01.500]  that does that as your enemy we don't owe this money it's a fraud to these

[3:48:12.220 --> 3:48:18.100]  Federal Reserve that Ron Paul's telling you about it's simple if somebody
[3:48:18.100 --> 3:48:23.540]  supports more wars and fake Patriot Act they're an enemy if somebody supports
[3:48:23.540 --> 3:48:31.980]  more taxes they're an enemy and I'm telling you the only threat from Obama
[3:48:31.980 --> 3:48:37.140]  is a massive stage terror attack and because of 9-11 truth exposing
[3:48:37.140 --> 3:48:41.540]  government-sponsored terrorism he may not be able to carry it out they're in
[3:48:41.540 --> 3:48:45.780]  there with their tacticians and their theoreticians and their sociologists and
[3:48:45.780 --> 3:48:49.100]  their anthropologists and their people that cracked the numbers and track the
[3:48:49.100 --> 3:48:53.500]  population and they're trying to gauge how to beat us taking our country by
[3:48:53.500 --> 3:49:03.500]  back right now and I'm telling you at the heart of it is Glenn Beck and I'm
[3:49:03.500 --> 3:49:13.100]  shaken by the responsibility I'm sick of the responsibility and I'm sick of

[3:49:31.140 --> 3:49:37.060]  conservative about Roger Ailes Glenn Beck and the Republican leadership

[3:55:25.140 --> 3:55:31.860]  the deadline had an effect been shelled and it goes into how they're just
[3:55:31.860 --> 3:55:37.140]  annihilated again the people know that carbon dioxide that plants breathe is
[3:55:37.140 --> 3:55:41.500]  an evil they know the government wants a new tax they know the new government to
[3:55:41.500 --> 3:55:45.940]  be set up on a planetary scale is a private banking consortium the problem
[3:55:45.940 --> 3:55:50.340]  is they just want open government power we already have the same central banks
[3:55:50.340 --> 3:55:55.020]  running our countries they just wanted a new more intensified scam where they
[3:55:55.020 --> 3:55:59.940]  actually have the government power not just through government have the power
[3:55:59.940 --> 3:56:05.460]  so we've got to defeat that but everybody should celebrate this upcoming
[3:56:05.460 --> 3:56:11.660]  weekend you know toast your iced tea or whatever when you're at dinner that we
[3:56:11.660 --> 3:56:18.060]  did it we shot down Copenhagen we shot down Coakley we are shooting down the
[3:56:18.060 --> 3:56:22.260]  government health care bill it is very close to being defeated Democrats are
[3:56:22.260 --> 3:56:26.220]  saying they're not gonna vote for it now but the Republicans are saying oh we'll
[3:56:26.220 --> 3:56:32.820]  do a compromise just get rid of abortion so you better concentrate on those
[3:56:32.820 --> 3:56:37.460]  Republicans the few that voted for it and the quote conservative Democrats and
[3:56:37.460 --> 3:56:42.980]  say no health care isn't broken you got 25 million people that are uninsured
[3:56:42.980 --> 3:56:47.660]  through charity care they already get care that's another lie as Ron Paul has
[3:56:47.660 --> 3:56:57.300]  said it's all a fraud a video editor six years ago self-employed he had to have a
[3:56:57.300 --> 3:57:02.580]  surgery Austin told him go ahead and die I told him here's the real rules on
[3:57:02.580 --> 3:57:06.220]  charity care and he ended up getting a twenty something thousand dollar
[3:57:06.220 --> 3:57:11.740]  surgery and everything got fixed for free the illegal aliens all get it they
[3:57:11.740 --> 3:57:14.500]  just don't want you know and that's a little goodie that's reserved to the
[3:57:14.500 --> 3:57:19.780]  illegal aliens my dad does about 30% of his dental care charity when you go to
[3:57:19.780 --> 3:57:23.060]  medical school they tell you you're gonna do 30% of your health care is
[3:57:23.060 --> 3:57:27.100]  charity you understand but see doctors have had their own power taken away by
[3:57:27.100 --> 3:57:31.180]  HMOs by health care companies who don't want that they want to take it from
[3:57:31.180 --> 3:57:36.940]  taxpayers and do it little kids that need heart surgery don't go without it
[3:57:36.940 --> 3:57:44.380]  it's all a lie but it is the illegal aliens bankrupting our system because
[3:57:44.380 --> 3:57:47.860]  they come here they have anchor babies they get on four or five different
[3:57:47.860 --> 3:57:53.420]  welfare checks they're babies a u.s. citizen and it's over and citizens
[3:57:53.420 --> 3:57:56.660]  get in trouble if we do that they should get in trouble and that's one of the
