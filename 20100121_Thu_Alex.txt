[00:00:05.003 --> 00:00:09.846]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[00:00:09.846 --> 00:00:11.427]  You want answers?
[00:00:11.427 --> 00:00:12.988]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:12.988 --> 00:00:17.171]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.171 --> 00:00:21.234]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:32.569 --> 00:00:39.515]  For the last three hours, Secretary of the Treasury, Little Timmy Geithner, is being grilled.
[00:00:39.515 --> 00:00:56.850]  He's being grilled concerning all of his criminal activity, giving himself and his former boss, the former head of Goldman Sachs and the former head of the Treasury, Henry Paulson, billions and billions of dollars.
[00:00:57.992 --> 00:01:07.183]  And ordering AIG, the holding company they use for the scam, not to tell the federal government or the public or the stockholders what had happened.
[00:01:08.635 --> 00:01:09.656]  He's being grilled.
[00:01:09.656 --> 00:01:15.599]  We've got some of the transcript of the serious questions that have been brought up to this individual.
[00:01:15.599 --> 00:01:19.921]  And Paulson's also set to testify later today.
[00:01:19.921 --> 00:01:25.003]  Other branches of the Congress want to interview him next week.
[00:01:25.003 --> 00:01:30.646]  We're going to be breaking that down today.
[00:01:30.646 --> 00:01:33.648]  Obviously, I want to talk more about Mr. Brown.
[00:01:36.061 --> 00:01:45.587]  Winning in Massachusetts yesterday on the one-year anniversary of Obama's first year in office.
[00:01:45.587 --> 00:01:48.008]  Isn't that apropos?
[00:01:48.008 --> 00:01:56.133]  And again, it doesn't matter if Mr. Brown is a rhino because this vote was a message to the government
[00:01:57.165 --> 00:01:58.585]  That we don't want big government.
[00:01:58.585 --> 00:02:01.306]  We don't want to be looted by the insurance companies.
[00:02:01.306 --> 00:02:08.408]  We don't want to go to prison and pay half million dollar fines if we don't have insurance.
[00:02:08.408 --> 00:02:13.810]  We don't want the agenda that's being pushed.
[00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:22.692]  The problem is the Republicans pushed almost the exact same agenda under George W. Bush.
[00:02:24.246 --> 00:02:32.913]  Many Republicans, like Newt Gingrich and others, have been some of the biggest supporters of the global greenhouse gas tax.
[00:02:32.913 --> 00:02:41.921]  Glenn Beck and others are calling for new taxes to pay off the debt to the bankers from their swindle.
[00:02:41.921 --> 00:02:49.447]  And so, yes, it's a big message to government that we don't want what they're doing, we don't like what they're doing.
[00:02:49.447 --> 00:02:50.328]  The problem is,
[00:02:51.960 --> 00:03:04.330]  Just like I told Democrats, don't hold your breath for Obama to do the right thing, I'm telling Republicans out there and Conservatives, don't hold your breath for the Republican Party.
[00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:09.974]  But people are waking up faster and faster and faster and faster.
[00:03:13.663 --> 00:03:20.008]  Whereas it took years for people to wake up to a particular political party's fraud, now it only takes months.
[00:03:20.008 --> 00:03:28.154]  And so there has been a major realignment against tyranny, against corruption in this country.
[00:03:28.154 --> 00:03:33.998]  There has been a massive realignment, a huge realignment.
[00:03:35.652 --> 00:03:41.260]  Now for the establishment, the only question is, can they sabotage that realignment?
[00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:45.246]  Can their operatives misguide that realignment?
[00:03:45.246 --> 00:03:49.653]  And that's what Rush Limbaugh and Glenn Beck and others are for.
[00:03:49.653 --> 00:03:50.754]  Though Rush Limbaugh is
[00:03:52.150 --> 00:03:53.290]  Does some good, actually.
[00:03:53.290 --> 00:03:56.932]  He was against the bailout from the beginning, even when Bush was for it.
[00:03:56.932 --> 00:04:01.353]  He's criticized the Patriot Act being used against U.S.
[00:04:01.353 --> 00:04:02.594]  citizens.
[00:04:02.594 --> 00:04:06.315]  As bad as he is, he's an angel compared to Glenn Beck.
[00:04:06.315 --> 00:04:09.156]  I mean, Glenn Beck is super bad news.
[00:04:09.156 --> 00:04:10.136]  But I'll tell you what I'm going to do.
[00:04:10.136 --> 00:04:17.218]  I'm not going to talk about Glenn Beck anymore until next week.
[00:04:17.218 --> 00:04:21.160]  And I am putting together with Paul Watson a catalog, a chronicle,
[00:04:22.108 --> 00:04:27.089]  of his flip-flopping and his lying and his deceit and who he really is.
[00:04:27.089 --> 00:04:41.972]  Instead of just kind of sideways going after Beck and mentioning things he does on a daily basis, we're just putting together a big catalog with video and audio of him in his own words so you can see the real Glenn Beck coming up next Monday.
[00:04:41.972 --> 00:04:47.833]  Okay, Hugo Chavez says the US used a tectonic weapon on Haiti.
[00:04:47.833 --> 00:04:48.773]  I'll tell you what I think of that.
[00:04:50.339 --> 00:04:52.941]  A TSA nominee got shot down.
[00:04:52.941 --> 00:04:55.742]  The one that says Christians are the number one enemy.
[00:04:55.742 --> 00:04:57.323]  It is all coming up today.
[00:04:57.323 --> 00:05:00.225]  You'll want to stay with us and open phones.
[00:05:00.225 --> 00:05:07.228]  This is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about the Ecola Blue Atmospheric Water Generator that produces pure drinking water right from the humidity in the air.
[00:05:07.228 --> 00:05:08.489]  No, this isn't science fiction.
[00:05:08.489 --> 00:05:09.309]  It's very real.
[00:05:09.309 --> 00:05:13.192]  I know because I use one every day in my own home and it's available right now to you.
[00:05:13.192 --> 00:05:17.494]  Because you know exactly where your water comes from with Ecola Blue, you'll know what's in your cup.

[00:06:01.829 --> 00:06:05.852]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[00:06:05.852 --> 00:06:09.075]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[00:06:09.075 --> 00:06:10.516]  As we're finishing off this agenda,
[00:06:11.221 --> 00:06:13.903]  That we're pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[00:06:13.903 --> 00:06:20.288]  I have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[00:06:20.288 --> 00:06:25.832]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[00:06:25.832 --> 00:06:35.460]  For the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation, the criminal offshore cartel, hell-bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government.
[00:06:35.580 --> 00:06:37.922]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists!
[00:06:37.922 --> 00:06:39.523]  They're asking for more matches!
[00:06:39.523 --> 00:06:41.965]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[00:06:41.965 --> 00:06:44.107]  Today seems like nobody does care.
[00:06:44.107 --> 00:06:49.251]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[00:06:49.251 --> 00:06:54.255]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com.

[00:07:00.256 --> 00:07:02.117]  Hi everyone, Andy Anderson here.
[00:07:02.117 --> 00:07:06.518]  Are you using those little bottles of hand gel that kill germs, bacteria, and other nasties?
[00:07:06.518 --> 00:07:12.320]  In today's world, that's smart, especially with the filthy doorknobs, shopping carts, and handrails we touch every day.
[00:07:12.320 --> 00:07:16.661]  Did you know that once the alcohol evaporates in a few seconds, goodbye effectiveness?
[00:07:16.661 --> 00:07:18.342]  No more protection till you use it again.
[00:07:18.502 --> 00:07:19.863]  PureWorks to the rescue!
[00:07:19.863 --> 00:07:24.248]  Our FDA-compliant foam, lotion, soap, and spray do not contain alcohol.

[00:08:02.091 --> 00:08:08.739]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[00:08:08.739 --> 00:08:11.703]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:30.029 --> 00:08:31.690]  We're live, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:08:31.690 --> 00:08:35.453]  It is Thursday, the 21st day of January 2010.
[00:08:35.453 --> 00:08:41.177]  We're going to be live here for the next three hours and 52 minutes.
[00:08:41.177 --> 00:08:46.481]  And what I'm going to do is open the phones up for the full four hours.
[00:08:46.481 --> 00:08:49.383]  The entire broadcast, we're going to open the phones up at 1-800-259-9231.
[00:08:55.247 --> 00:08:58.289]  Let me throw out the important news, what I think is important.
[00:08:58.289 --> 00:09:01.712]  You're welcome to call him with whatever you think is interesting or informative.
[00:09:01.712 --> 00:09:03.954]  And we will go over it all.
[00:09:03.954 --> 00:09:17.584]  By the end of the broadcast today, I'm going to play some clips from the ongoing hearing with Tim Geithner as he's being grilled for all of his clearly criminal activity.
[00:09:17.584 --> 00:09:21.227]  So that is coming up as well in the last hour.
[00:09:23.493 --> 00:09:25.674]  Well, what type of news do we have here in front of us?
[00:09:25.674 --> 00:09:28.675]  Ron Paul says the U.S.
[00:09:28.675 --> 00:09:33.836]  is under a CIA coup and runs our military.
[00:09:33.836 --> 00:09:35.697]  Now, you talk about bold.
[00:09:35.697 --> 00:09:46.621]  Most people in history that have come out who have any political power and have stated this have died in hunting accidents, car wrecks, or canoeing accidents, or have heart attacks basically within a month.
[00:09:47.609 --> 00:09:57.191]  Because the CIA was set up by Wall Street to bring in narcotics, to run child kidnapping, and to murder anyone that tries to upset what Wall Street's doing.
[00:09:57.191 --> 00:09:59.471]  And that's just mainline historical record.
[00:09:59.471 --> 00:10:07.233]  And Ron Paul came right out and admitted that the CIA is involved in narcotics trafficking.
[00:10:07.233 --> 00:10:11.094]  And he did this at the Campaign for Liberty conference.
[00:10:11.094 --> 00:10:12.294]  That's why I love Ron Paul.
[00:10:14.196 --> 00:10:15.958]  He just has amazing courage.
[00:10:15.958 --> 00:10:27.588]  So he's not only going after the Federal Reserve, the private consortium of the true government in this country, but he's going after their murder arm, their hit arm.
[00:10:27.588 --> 00:10:37.876]  And you heard Anthony Schaeffer of Able Danger, who would have been able to kill Bin Laden and Al Qaeda leadership in the months before 9-11, he was pulled off of it by the CIA.
[00:10:40.253 --> 00:10:43.734]  And he said here on air, the CIA is taking over the army.
[00:10:43.734 --> 00:10:45.555]  They run everything.
[00:10:45.555 --> 00:10:47.216]  They run most of the mainstream media.
[00:10:47.216 --> 00:10:48.916]  They run Glenn Beck.
[00:10:48.916 --> 00:10:56.119]  They run Chris Matthews.
[00:10:56.119 --> 00:10:57.720]  And they've got to be stopped.
[00:10:57.720 --> 00:11:04.562]  They're there to make sure Wall Street can rob and destroy this country.
[00:11:04.562 --> 00:11:06.303]  And Ron Paul has called them out.
[00:11:07.267 --> 00:11:09.529]  Ron Paul is the real Bonafide.
[00:11:09.529 --> 00:11:13.994]  I mean, if you don't have discernment out there and haven't watched his history, let me just tell you.
[00:11:13.994 --> 00:11:16.236]  Ron Paul's the real deal.
[00:11:19.389 --> 00:11:20.950]  And so that is coming up today.
[00:11:20.950 --> 00:11:24.232]  We're going to play that clip later in this hour.
[00:11:24.232 --> 00:11:30.056]  Hugo Chavez, and we have this clip as well, but it's in Spanish, but Chavez says U.S.
[00:11:30.056 --> 00:11:32.357]  weapon caused Haiti quake.
[00:11:32.357 --> 00:11:45.206]  Venezuelan leader Hugo Chavez yesterday accused the United States of causing the destruction in Haiti by testing a tectonic weapon to induce the catastrophic earthquake that hit the country last week.
[00:11:47.079 --> 00:11:48.379]  Hugo Chavez said the U.S.
[00:11:48.379 --> 00:11:56.842]  was playing God by testing devices capable of creating eco-type catastrophes, a Spanish newspaper ABC quoted him as saying.
[00:11:56.842 --> 00:12:05.105]  The 7.0 magnitude quake rattled the desperately poor country on January 12th, killing an estimated 100,000 to 200,000 people.
[00:12:05.105 --> 00:12:06.105]  Over 2 million are homeless.
[00:12:08.837 --> 00:12:14.900]  Chavez said the killer quake followed the test of a weapon of earthquakes just offshore from Haiti.
[00:12:14.900 --> 00:12:17.001]  He did not elaborate on the source of the claim.
[00:12:17.001 --> 00:12:24.304]  We do know the Pentagon was running a drill of Haiti being hit by a hurricane at the exact same time, but that isn't proof.
[00:12:24.304 --> 00:12:28.386]  Secretary of Defense William Cohen, and later when I get to this article I'm going to read from it,
[00:12:31.257 --> 00:12:44.184]  Secretary of Defense Cohen, in the Army Times, he was at a press conference, April 28th, 1996, said, there are other governments that have earthquake weapons, we have earthquake weapons, he called them tectonic weapons.
[00:12:44.184 --> 00:12:56.310]  But just because they say they have these weapons, and we know they do, we know they have hurricane creation systems, that's been declassified five years ago, they had it certified in 67, doesn't mean that's what happened here.
[00:12:58.513 --> 00:13:05.020]  There are naturally occurring earthquakes in Central and South America and in North America.
[00:13:05.020 --> 00:13:12.188]  They're particularly bad in Guatemala and places like that, and in Ecuador.
[00:13:12.188 --> 00:13:16.733]  Haiti is not known for particularly bad earthquakes, but they do have them.
[00:13:16.733 --> 00:13:17.854]  They had another one yesterday.
[00:13:19.721 --> 00:13:32.404]  There is a 1950s declassified plan of the Australian News reported on of the Australian government with the British government wanting to set nukes off on the undersea floor to cause earthquakes and tsunamis.
[00:13:32.404 --> 00:13:38.686]  And so, yes, as early as what, 1955 in that case, 54, excuse me, they were saying they had it.
[00:13:38.686 --> 00:13:39.066]  I don't know.
[00:13:40.822 --> 00:13:41.242]  I don't know.
[00:13:41.242 --> 00:13:56.933]  I mean, I wouldn't put it past him, but Hugo Chavez really is letting power go to his head with really no evidence, because I've got the newspaper report here and him on TV saying in Spanish, and he doesn't really ever offer any proof.
[00:13:56.933 --> 00:14:05.559]  But bring it into it, nevertheless, and get your take on that.
[00:14:05.559 --> 00:14:09.062]  Also, and again, I'm going to cover this more on Monday.
[00:14:10.089 --> 00:14:22.814]  Instead of just covering back a little here, a little there, going, hey, look, he wants a new tax, a new national sales tax, and a value-added tax, which they'll keep on top, the income tax, to pay off the banks.
[00:14:24.108 --> 00:14:26.169]  And, hey, look, he's saying Ron Paul's a terrorist.
[00:14:26.169 --> 00:14:28.289]  Or, look, he's saying the bailout's needed.
[00:14:28.289 --> 00:14:33.951]  Or, look, he's saying we've got to attack more countries and the Patriot Act's good and torture's good.
[00:14:33.951 --> 00:14:39.912]  Instead of just mentioning a few of these, we're just creating a catalog of it all in his own words.
[00:14:39.912 --> 00:14:43.133]  And I'm going to cover it on Monday, because he's dangerous.
[00:14:47.418 --> 00:14:57.568]  I mean, now he says, this article is up on PrisonPlanet.com, InfoWars.com, Beck says truth activists in White House threaten Obama's life.
[00:14:57.568 --> 00:14:59.050]  I mean, it's completely insane.
[00:14:59.050 --> 00:15:00.651]  No proof, no nothing.
[00:15:00.651 --> 00:15:02.954]  Talk about slander, libel, defamation.
[00:15:04.597 --> 00:15:07.339]  Just comes out and says there's 9-11 truthers in his administration.
[00:15:07.339 --> 00:15:11.582]  No, the only person that was ever connected to 9-11 truth in any way got kicked out.
[00:15:11.582 --> 00:15:16.145]  Cass Sunstein, the White House regulations czar, says arrest 9-11 truthers.
[00:15:16.145 --> 00:15:17.566]  Make it illegal.
[00:15:17.566 --> 00:15:22.810]  The White House agrees with you, Becky.
[00:15:22.810 --> 00:15:31.056]  And so, I want to, just like I exposed Obama as a false revolutionary, as a deceiver, as someone who would lie and bait and switch,
[00:15:32.190 --> 00:15:43.739]  I did that at the height of his popularity, and even mainstream news cites the Obama deception and Fall of the Republic as seminal films that have really damaged Obama.
[00:15:43.739 --> 00:15:52.265]  Because we attacked him, not from a fake right-wing perspective, but from a truthful perspective of what he really is.
[00:15:52.265 --> 00:15:56.888]  A corporate shill here to rob people, and here to get the population to stand down.
[00:15:56.888 --> 00:16:00.091]  Now, Beck is the equivalent of Barack Obama.
[00:16:00.091 --> 00:16:01.612]  We must target him now.
[00:16:08.885 --> 00:16:14.892]  We are forced to go after him because he understands what the White House understands.
[00:16:14.892 --> 00:16:18.976]  What Cass Sunstein understands in his talking points.
[00:16:18.976 --> 00:16:23.041]  The number one enemy of the New World Order is 9-11 Truth.
[00:16:23.041 --> 00:16:26.805]  Because 9-11 Truth exposed that that was a false flag terror attack.
[00:16:28.325 --> 00:16:31.167]  And they expose other events as false flag terror attacks.
[00:16:31.167 --> 00:16:38.332]  And we educate the public that there are hundreds of examples where our government and other governments admit they staged terror attacks.
[00:16:38.332 --> 00:16:46.817]  And now the government, the Pentagon, and the CIA's favorite tool of staged terror is a broken mechanism.
[00:16:46.817 --> 00:16:53.261]  And Beck again last night did it again on his show.
[00:16:53.261 --> 00:16:57.024]  He said 9-11 Truth is planning to kill the President.
[00:16:58.120 --> 00:17:04.285]  And then, last night, he came out again.
[00:17:04.285 --> 00:17:07.167]  He came out and basically said the same thing.
[00:17:07.167 --> 00:17:15.494]  So, we have a big problem.
[00:17:15.494 --> 00:17:20.398]  And so, this is what he does over and over and over again.
[00:17:20.398 --> 00:17:22.320]  But, look, I'm going to hold my tongue on the subject.
[00:17:30.174 --> 00:17:43.053]  I'm going to hold my tongue and I'm just going to properly go after him with a mini-documentary that will premiere in the next few weeks.
[00:17:44.465 --> 00:17:51.588]  The problem is you've got so much evil duplicity he's involved in that it really is hard to make it short.
[00:17:51.588 --> 00:17:58.432]  But we're just going to do it and put it out there so it's on record so people start paying attention and start noticing what this guy's doing.
[00:17:58.432 --> 00:18:08.836]  I mean, for anybody who's studied how these people operate, it's as obvious as the nose on your face, but I'm done talking about it.
[00:18:08.836 --> 00:18:12.078]  The point is, it needs to be exposed and we're going to expose it.
[00:18:14.551 --> 00:18:35.133]  But isn't it interesting that on the first anniversary of hope and change and everything was going to be different, the wars were going to end, and the Patriot Act was going to end, and torture was going to end, and secret arrest was going to end, and transparency in government was going to be back, and there wasn't going to be any more signing statements, and
[00:18:38.188 --> 00:18:39.108]  It was a new dawn.
[00:18:39.108 --> 00:18:42.090]  We were saved by the messianic leader, Barack Obama.
[00:18:42.090 --> 00:18:51.894]  A year later, a complete rebuke of him, the lowest approval rating of any president in history, one year in, and plunging fast.
[00:18:51.894 --> 00:18:58.817]  I mean, he's way below previous people that had low approval ratings like Jimmy Carter and Dwight Eisenhower.
[00:18:58.817 --> 00:19:06.060]  He's way beneath them that State Senator Brown, Scott Brown,
[00:19:08.362 --> 00:19:12.486]  Has now been put into the Senate, replacing Ted Kennedy's slot.
[00:19:12.486 --> 00:19:17.290]  Scott Brown election win, a massive rebellion against big government.
[00:19:17.290 --> 00:19:25.637]  The problem is, the Republicans are going to continue to expand the Pentagon budget that Obama's already broken the record on.
[00:19:25.637 --> 00:19:28.980]  They're going to continue to want to use the Patriot Act against the American people.
[00:19:28.980 --> 00:19:34.464]  You're not going to hear a rebuke of Homeland Security and FEMA training to go up against gun owners, conservatives, libertarians.
[00:19:35.359 --> 00:19:36.640]  Ron Paul supporters.
[00:19:36.640 --> 00:19:41.022]  After all, Glenn Beck says Ron Paul supporters need to have the army used against them.
[00:19:41.022 --> 00:19:43.023]  You're not going to see any of it reversed.
[00:19:43.023 --> 00:19:44.564]  Mark my words.
[00:19:44.564 --> 00:19:52.128]  When the Republicans get into control of the House next year, later this year, into next year, they'll be seated next year.
[00:19:52.128 --> 00:19:57.530]  When the Republicans get into power, you're going to see them betray you.
[00:19:57.530 --> 00:19:59.431]  Just get ready.
[00:19:59.431 --> 00:20:01.352]  We'll be back.
[00:20:01.352 --> 00:20:04.314]  When you hear the words water purification, what comes to mind?
[00:20:05.162 --> 00:20:08.626]  Berkey Water Purification Systems, this message is for you.
[00:20:08.626 --> 00:20:12.350]  Did you know that over 60% of municipal water contains fluoride?
[00:20:12.350 --> 00:20:19.638]  At less than 2 cents per gallon, Berkey Water Filters purify treated and untreated water, remove dangerous chlorine, fluoride, and

[00:20:45.491 --> 00:20:49.974]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[00:20:49.974 --> 00:20:52.295]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[00:20:52.295 --> 00:20:53.455]  As we're finishing off this agenda,
[00:21:11.886 --> 00:21:14.569]  They'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[00:21:14.569 --> 00:21:20.955]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[00:21:20.955 --> 00:21:26.500]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[00:21:26.500 --> 00:21:36.129]  For the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation, the criminal offshore cartel, hell-bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government.
[00:21:36.229 --> 00:21:38.591]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists!
[00:21:38.591 --> 00:21:40.172]  They're asking for more matches!
[00:21:40.172 --> 00:21:42.635]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[00:21:42.635 --> 00:21:44.756]  Today seems like nobody does care.
[00:21:44.756 --> 00:21:49.921]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[00:21:49.921 --> 00:21:54.925]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com.
[00:21:54.925 --> 00:21:59.029]  Or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:22:00.922 --> 00:22:03.244]  Good day, Jim Newcomer from Midas Resources.
[00:22:03.244 --> 00:22:03.725]  January 21st, 2010.
[00:22:03.725 --> 00:22:04.746]  Gold opened this morning at $1,105.
[00:22:04.746 --> 00:22:08.089]  A one ounce gold coin can be purchased for $1135.26, $567.63 for a half ounce, and $283.82 for the quarter ounce.
[00:22:08.089 --> 00:22:08.850]  That's $1135.26, $567.63, and $283.82.
[00:22:20.962 --> 00:22:34.596]  How is it that we the people grow the cotton, weave it into fabric, engrave the ink, embed the strips and fibers that protect it from counterfeit, then cart the money off to a privately owned bank to have it lent back to us at interest, forcing us to pay taxes to service the debt?
[00:22:34.596 --> 00:22:43.425]  Is this capitalism, or was Jefferson correct when he said, a central bank issuing a public currency is a greater menace to the liberties of the people than a standing army?
[00:22:43.425 --> 00:22:44.326]  Hi, Ted Anderson
[00:22:44.506 --> 00:22:48.868]  I'm placing a silver dollar inside of a book that explains how the monetary system works.
[00:22:48.868 --> 00:22:49.969]  Call for your copy 1-800-686-2237.
[00:22:49.969 --> 00:22:50.969]  Isn't it time to understand the system?
[00:22:50.969 --> 00:22:51.229]  Call 800-686-2237.
[00:22:51.229 --> 00:22:51.590]  That's 800-686-2237.
[00:23:00.994 --> 00:23:03.415]  You have a mortgage and a load of other debt.
[00:23:03.415 --> 00:23:05.316]  Wouldn't it be great if it all just went away?
[00:23:05.316 --> 00:23:07.177]  No More Mortgage can change your life.
[00:23:07.177 --> 00:23:08.597]  We paid off all of our bills.
[00:23:08.597 --> 00:23:11.379]  All your debt, including your mortgage, in as little as nine years.
[00:23:11.379 --> 00:23:17.041]  With No More Mortgage, we will have saved over $313,000 in interest payments.
[00:23:17.041 --> 00:23:18.722]  Even have more money left over each month?
[00:23:18.722 --> 00:23:21.323]  It lowered our monthly payments by a little over $500.
[00:23:21.323 --> 00:23:21.783]  No More Mortgage.
[00:23:23.824 --> 00:23:25.105]  Where have they been all of our life?
[00:23:25.105 --> 00:23:27.606]  If you knew about something like that, you'd want to tell everybody.
[00:23:27.606 --> 00:23:31.489]  Whenever I have a friend or someone that needs this service, I give them the number.
[00:23:31.489 --> 00:23:33.650]  I'm Larry Ruff, president of No More Mortgage.

[00:23:48.559 --> 00:23:49.079]  This works.
[00:23:49.079 --> 00:23:49.380]  Call the number.
[00:23:53.522 --> 00:23:54.563]  Call now for your free CD.
[00:23:54.563 --> 00:23:54.623]  800-578-6279.
[00:23:54.623 --> 00:23:54.763]  800-578-6279.
[00:23:54.763 --> 00:23:56.464]  Geithner's getting grilled right now, so is Paulson.
[00:23:56.464 --> 00:23:57.105]  Look how far we've come.
[00:24:24.704 --> 00:24:32.651]  The general public just ten years ago would look at you like you were a twelve-headed monster if you talked about the Federal Reserve being private.
[00:24:32.651 --> 00:24:36.794]  The media had demonized people for decades saying it didn't even exist.
[00:24:36.794 --> 00:24:38.216]  Rothschilds didn't exist.
[00:24:38.216 --> 00:24:39.817]  Rockefellers didn't exist.
[00:24:39.817 --> 00:24:42.099]  Council on Foreign Relations didn't exist.
[00:24:42.099 --> 00:24:43.560]  They actually said that.
[00:24:43.560 --> 00:24:46.282]  Kind of like CNN three years ago saying Ron Paul's a kook.
[00:24:47.502 --> 00:24:49.943]  The Trans-Texas Corridor doesn't even exist.
[00:24:49.943 --> 00:24:51.743]  I actually have that video clip.
[00:24:51.743 --> 00:25:04.086]  When it was openly announced and billboards up everywhere in the state where I live, part of the Napa Superhighway, they think you're so dumb, they would tell you it didn't exist.
[00:25:04.086 --> 00:25:07.727]  And I love the fact the media continues to try this deception.
[00:25:07.727 --> 00:25:13.268]  But it's hurt them so bad that now they're going, yeah, we want a world government, but it's for your best interest.
[00:25:13.268 --> 00:25:15.609]  And yeah, there is a carbon tax.
[00:25:16.570 --> 00:25:23.654]  And it's for your best interest, but it blows up in their face.
[00:25:23.654 --> 00:25:31.879]  I mean, look at what's happening on the first anniversary of hope and change.
[00:25:31.879 --> 00:25:32.959]  Look at what's happening.
[00:25:32.959 --> 00:25:36.241]  There is hope and change, but it didn't come from Obama.
[00:25:36.241 --> 00:25:43.085]  By him dashing everyone's hopes for change, he's actually woken everybody up.
[00:25:45.788 --> 00:25:56.211]  Their scam on the swine flu has now completely fallen apart.
[00:25:56.211 --> 00:26:04.073]  The White House TSA nominee, Eroll Southers, has withdrawn his nomination after a six-month battle.
[00:26:04.073 --> 00:26:12.155]  He gave public press conferences where he said that Christians are the number one enemy of the government and the number one terror threat.
[00:26:15.865 --> 00:26:20.830]  Mr. Southers was simply publicly saying what was in all their training manuals.
[00:26:20.830 --> 00:26:22.112]  Ha ha!
[00:26:22.112 --> 00:26:25.556]  Hey, you're not supposed to tell the slaves that!
[00:26:25.556 --> 00:26:28.619]  E-roll, Southers!
[00:26:28.619 --> 00:26:31.522]  Or E-roll!
[00:26:31.522 --> 00:26:35.587]  You weren't supposed to let the slaves know that the whole government's gunning for the American people!
[00:26:37.961 --> 00:26:44.592]  You're supposed to be like Glenn Beck and say Homeland Security's for the brown people in Central Asia and the Middle East.
[00:26:44.592 --> 00:26:48.758]  And to get up on a show and say, Al-Qaeda's got nukes in America.
[00:26:48.758 --> 00:26:50.141]  And it's gonna nuke us any minute.
[00:26:51.567 --> 00:26:53.768]  That's the Pentagon talking point.
[00:26:53.768 --> 00:27:04.392]  It came out that they paid Tommy Franks half a million bucks plus to run around and go on TV and go, geez, shucks, I don't want it, but it's what we need.
[00:27:04.392 --> 00:27:10.895]  One more big terror attack like a nuke from Al-Qaeda and we're going to have a military form of government in America.
[00:27:10.895 --> 00:27:13.056]  It's what the people want.
[00:27:13.056 --> 00:27:15.997]  Oh, shucks, the CIA just hates it.
[00:27:15.997 --> 00:27:20.199]  They don't want an open dictatorship like they've set up in over a hundred countries.
[00:27:21.179 --> 00:27:26.140]  Oh, shucks, they set up torture centers all over the world in countries they take over.
[00:27:26.140 --> 00:27:29.081]  Oh, shucks, we don't want that here.
[00:27:29.081 --> 00:27:34.082]  We're not dominant, powerful, psychopathic men, warmongering killers.
[00:27:34.082 --> 00:27:40.243]  We want to keep you safe from al-Qaeda that we founded in 1979 that we run and protect.
[00:27:40.243 --> 00:27:43.924]  I mean, excuse me.
[00:27:43.924 --> 00:27:45.085]  I'm a conservative.
[00:27:45.085 --> 00:27:46.325]  I'm keeping you safe.
[00:27:50.254 --> 00:27:54.658]  Every Pentagon talking point, that all comes out of any of their mouths.
[00:27:54.658 --> 00:27:57.940]  Obama czars, arrest 9-11 truthers.
[00:27:57.940 --> 00:28:01.223]  Beck, 9-11 truthers are going to kill Obama.
[00:28:01.223 --> 00:28:03.825]  Beck, we've got to go after Iran.
[00:28:03.825 --> 00:28:07.007]  Obama, we've got to go after Iran.
[00:28:07.007 --> 00:28:09.950]  Obama, increasing all the warfare.
[00:28:09.950 --> 00:28:13.553]  And then that's the liberal position and the Republicans are just nuke everyone.
[00:28:14.301 --> 00:28:21.527]  See how they play this political game by having the Republicans come out for even more war and then criticize Obama?
[00:28:21.527 --> 00:28:23.148]  You're only starting two new wars!
[00:28:23.148 --> 00:28:24.449]  We want 50 new ones!
[00:28:24.449 --> 00:28:25.169]  More!
[00:28:25.169 --> 00:28:28.212]  Give us more now!
[00:28:28.212 --> 00:28:30.874]  We need new taxes to pay the banks!
[00:28:30.874 --> 00:28:32.195]  What's wrong with you, Obama?
[00:28:32.195 --> 00:28:33.035]  You liberal?
[00:28:33.035 --> 00:28:33.836]  Raise taxes!
[00:28:33.836 --> 00:28:37.819]  You're not raising enough!
[00:28:37.819 --> 00:28:39.020]  What's wrong with you, Obama?
[00:28:40.074 --> 00:28:42.017]  You know, your health care plan isn't good.
[00:28:42.017 --> 00:28:46.042]  What we need is an excise tax, a value-added tax, and a sales tax.
[00:28:46.042 --> 00:28:50.588]  That's what's really conservative, and these Ron Paul people need to be arrested!
[00:28:50.588 --> 00:28:55.434]  They want to kill the president!
[00:28:55.434 --> 00:28:55.715]  That...
[00:28:57.185 --> 00:28:58.386]  is George Washington.
[00:28:58.386 --> 00:28:59.967]  That's our George Washington.
[00:28:59.967 --> 00:29:02.329]  An effeminate, prancing weasel.
[00:29:02.329 --> 00:29:03.990]  Okay, I can't stop.
[00:29:03.990 --> 00:29:08.593]  See, I've been doing all this research for the Glenn Beck deception.
[00:29:08.593 --> 00:29:10.374]  I'll go ahead and tell you the name.
[00:29:10.374 --> 00:29:11.535]  It's going to be a free film.
[00:29:11.535 --> 00:29:15.838]  It's not going to be that long.
[00:29:15.838 --> 00:29:18.380]  It can be 100 hours long, but I'm doing this for humanity.
[00:29:19.482 --> 00:29:26.665]  We're going to expose him and play a bunch of clips next week, but then a few weeks after that, I'm going to make the Glenn Beck Deception.
[00:29:26.665 --> 00:29:31.928]  And Beck, hope you enjoy this torpedo of truth, because it's going to sink you, pal.
[00:29:31.928 --> 00:29:34.249]  Oh, it won't sink you today.
[00:29:34.249 --> 00:29:36.650]  But see, it'll give everybody your trail, your scent.
[00:29:36.650 --> 00:29:41.613]  Everybody will know where to look.
[00:29:41.613 --> 00:29:44.074]  And then the sinking begins.
[00:29:44.074 --> 00:29:45.935]  So you enjoy it, boy.
[00:29:45.935 --> 00:29:48.136]  You're going to sink yourself when you engage in the treason.
[00:29:48.136 --> 00:29:48.696]  I know you will.
[00:29:51.235 --> 00:29:55.158]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[00:29:55.158 --> 00:29:57.840]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:00.356 --> 00:30:04.898]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[00:30:04.898 --> 00:30:05.818]  Number one.
[00:30:05.818 --> 00:30:09.240]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[00:30:09.240 --> 00:30:10.100]  Number two.
[00:30:10.100 --> 00:30:15.002]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[00:30:15.002 --> 00:30:15.743]  It's true.
[00:30:15.743 --> 00:30:20.605]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[00:30:20.605 --> 00:30:21.065]  Number three.
[00:30:21.425 --> 00:30:25.008]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[00:30:25.008 --> 00:30:29.732]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[00:30:29.732 --> 00:30:32.495]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[00:30:32.495 --> 00:30:36.959]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[00:30:36.959 --> 00:30:41.103]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[00:30:41.103 --> 00:30:45.867]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[00:30:46.147 --> 00:30:50.309]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[00:30:50.309 --> 00:30:52.110]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[00:30:52.110 --> 00:30:54.372]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun.
[00:30:54.372 --> 00:31:02.176]  So go to mysolarbackup.com or call 1-877-327-0365.
[00:31:02.176 --> 00:31:06.198]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[00:31:06.198 --> 00:31:09.440]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[00:31:09.440 --> 00:31:10.861]  As we're finishing off this agenda,
[00:31:11.559 --> 00:31:14.220]  They'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[00:31:14.220 --> 00:31:20.622]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[00:31:20.622 --> 00:31:25.804]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[00:31:25.804 --> 00:31:35.788]  Fall of the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation, the criminal offshore cartel, hell-bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government.
[00:31:35.908 --> 00:31:38.270]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists!
[00:31:38.270 --> 00:31:39.851]  They're asking for more matches!
[00:31:39.851 --> 00:31:42.312]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[00:31:42.312 --> 00:31:44.153]  Today seems like nobody does care.
[00:31:44.153 --> 00:31:49.577]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[00:31:49.577 --> 00:31:54.600]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com.
[00:31:54.600 --> 00:31:58.702]  Or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:32:00.885 --> 00:32:04.406]  Before you throw away your used batteries, you need to listen to this.
[00:32:04.406 --> 00:32:06.407]  Now, going green can save money.
[00:32:06.407 --> 00:32:11.968]  Go green and save money by giving life to your used batteries by charging them with the Renaissance Charger.
[00:32:11.968 --> 00:32:19.990]  The Renaissance Charger uses a new revolutionary battery charging technology that effectively extends the life of new batteries and gives new life to used batteries.
[00:32:19.990 --> 00:32:30.333]  Invented by legendary audio genius John Bedini, this unique and patented charging system rejuvenates the electrochemical plate structure in the battery without additives, increasing capacity
[00:32:30.513 --> 00:32:31.093]  I think so.
[00:33:09.367 --> 00:33:21.417]  Glenn Beck, Roger Ailes, the Republican Party have taken over the Tea Parties.
[00:33:37.131 --> 00:33:42.819]  So when I say I'm gonna sink Glenn Beck, I'm gonna lay out his real record.
[00:33:52.569 --> 00:34:09.103]  I'm going to expose who he really is, because people just watch him day to day and don't see his history, so that when he goes further, once the Republicans get back in office, it'll take years, everyone will then know the truth and that it was premeditated, and then he'll just be like Bill O'Reilly.
[00:34:09.103 --> 00:34:14.168]  He'll still be on the air, it's just that he will only have the dumbest of the dumb that believe him.
[00:34:16.226 --> 00:34:20.251]  And that's our job, is to get a real constitutional republic back.
[00:34:20.251 --> 00:34:29.264]  I mean, if the change we're going to get from Glenn Beck and the Republican Party is more George Bush-type behavior, that is not what the people want, that is not what will save this country.
[00:34:30.899 --> 00:34:33.101]  You know, we do not need a new sales tax.
[00:34:33.101 --> 00:34:38.305]  We do not need an excise tax or a value-added tax that they're going to keep right along with the income tax.
[00:34:38.305 --> 00:34:47.373]  For more than a decade, I told you when the banks tried to bankrupt us by design, they would have conservative groups push a sales tax to replace it and then give you both.
[00:34:47.373 --> 00:34:50.115]  And now that is happening exactly as I told you.
[00:34:50.115 --> 00:34:53.878]  Because I've looked at the big foundations that have been funding this for more than a decade.
[00:34:53.878 --> 00:34:55.439]  They've been planning this all along.
[00:34:55.439 --> 00:34:56.921]  I know their game plan.
[00:34:58.880 --> 00:35:01.662]  New taxes is not conservative.
[00:35:01.662 --> 00:35:07.226]  The Patriot Act being used against the American people is not conservative.
[00:35:07.226 --> 00:35:10.729]  Barack Obama launching new wars is not anti-war.
[00:35:10.729 --> 00:35:12.010]  It's all a fraud.
[00:35:12.010 --> 00:35:14.492]  They work for the same people.
[00:35:14.492 --> 00:35:19.816]  And I know all day Beck and others have taken on the political coloration of this radio show.
[00:35:21.121 --> 00:35:25.745]  And they get up there and say it's not about a D, it's not about an R, it's about being patriots.
[00:35:25.745 --> 00:35:33.471]  But then being a patriot means launching more wars and raising taxes and saying that 9-11 truthers want to kill Obama.
[00:35:33.471 --> 00:35:36.093]  And that Ron Paul's a kook and bad.
[00:35:36.093 --> 00:35:39.956]  And every time I mention that, I get Glenn Beck supporters emailing me saying, where did he say that?
[00:35:39.956 --> 00:35:40.997]  Where did he say that?
[00:35:40.997 --> 00:35:43.279]  You must be hiding under a rock.
[00:35:43.279 --> 00:35:49.364]  Last night I did some research and found more than 10 clips of him saying it, one of them just a few months ago on his radio show.
[00:35:51.496 --> 00:35:52.357]  That's the problem!
[00:35:52.357 --> 00:35:55.302]  I haven't even done much research into this guy and it's completely apparent.
[00:35:55.302 --> 00:35:57.927]  Okay.
[00:35:57.927 --> 00:36:04.016]  Obviously, you know, once I put my thinking cap on and start focusing on somebody, I can't stop thinking about them or attacking them, just like Obama.
[00:36:05.336 --> 00:36:08.677]  All you Democrats that emailed me and called me and attacked me everywhere.
[00:36:08.677 --> 00:36:13.058]  How dare you say Obama isn't real change, you stinking Republican?
[00:36:13.058 --> 00:36:16.859]  How dare you say, how dare you lie about him?
[00:36:16.859 --> 00:36:18.760]  He never said he was going to end the war.
[00:36:18.760 --> 00:36:20.920]  He never said he wasn't going to have signing statements.
[00:36:20.920 --> 00:36:22.861]  He never said he wouldn't hire a lobbyist.
[00:36:22.861 --> 00:36:24.722]  He never said he wouldn't stop torture.
[00:36:24.722 --> 00:36:26.802]  He never said he wouldn't stop secret arrest.
[00:36:26.802 --> 00:36:30.783]  He never said, he never said, he never said he would cut the defense budget.
[00:36:30.783 --> 00:36:32.864]  He never said, yes he did say,
[00:36:33.806 --> 00:36:35.884]  And we made the film showing his lies!
[00:36:38.598 --> 00:36:49.181]  And the Obama deception did it first and is on record, torpedoing Obama, because our great listeners who are real patriots got the information out to everybody.
[00:36:49.181 --> 00:36:51.782]  Now, they've created another counter-revolution.
[00:36:51.782 --> 00:37:03.405]  Remember all the Democrats all crying, and, oh my gosh, the economy's saved, I'm gonna get my house and car payment paid for, my problems are over, oh thank you, Obama, you saved me!
[00:37:03.405 --> 00:37:04.245]  Now they're crying.
[00:37:05.683 --> 00:37:12.247]  Now they know they were conned, and running into the hands of the Republicans as if they're going to save you.
[00:37:12.247 --> 00:37:16.309]  Now we've got to expose them!
[00:37:16.309 --> 00:37:20.232]  But we are winning.
[00:37:20.232 --> 00:37:29.197]  On every front, their Copenhagen greenhouse gas tax initiative just went down in flames.
[00:37:29.197 --> 00:37:31.198]  The Times of London is reporting the U.S.
[00:37:31.198 --> 00:37:34.801]  did not even sign on to the internal U.N.
[00:37:34.801 --> 00:37:35.221]  agreement.
[00:37:37.608 --> 00:37:42.992]  Their flu hoax completely blew up in their face.
[00:37:42.992 --> 00:37:59.605]  Their health care plan, the Democrats are now in the news saying that this signals the fact that they will not get the health care bill and all they can hope for is the Senate version, which is the better of the two, the least egregious.
[00:37:59.605 --> 00:38:03.588]  And that the states are still going to block that.
[00:38:03.588 --> 00:38:04.789]  Because it's unconstitutional.
[00:38:07.099 --> 00:38:10.400]  And unfair the way it's implemented, not just weights and measures.
[00:38:10.400 --> 00:38:11.541]  It's discriminatory.
[00:38:11.541 --> 00:38:15.362]  That's in flames.
[00:38:15.362 --> 00:38:25.546]  National polls show the majority of Americans are against all these new wars they've launched in Yemen and Pakistan, even though they staged the underwater, the underwear bomber.
[00:38:25.546 --> 00:38:28.748]  Congressmen are coming out from both parties against the naked body scanners.
[00:38:28.748 --> 00:38:30.188]  Lawsuits are being filed.
[00:38:30.188 --> 00:38:31.909]  People are taking action and saying no.
[00:38:33.442 --> 00:38:39.440]  There's a major realignment taking place against big government across the board.
[00:38:43.382 --> 00:38:44.062]  Raw story.
[00:38:44.062 --> 00:38:45.403]  Democrat talking points.
[00:38:45.403 --> 00:38:49.565]  We can't pass legislation anymore, despite majority.
[00:38:49.565 --> 00:38:59.790]  Democrats have conceded they can no longer pass health care on their own, ensuring that their key legislative reform either dies or accepts further compromises to gain approval from Republican members.
[00:38:59.790 --> 00:39:04.092]  What Republican members want is abortion cut out, and that's good, but not good enough.
[00:39:04.092 --> 00:39:08.735]  It's still got the provision to force you to get the overpriced health care.
[00:39:08.735 --> 00:39:10.816]  It's still got all the bad provisions in it.
[00:39:10.816 --> 00:39:11.056]  No!
[00:39:13.476 --> 00:39:15.157]  No!
[00:39:15.157 --> 00:39:20.499]  We're not gonna let the Republicans sell us out.
[00:39:20.499 --> 00:39:25.740]  You know, Dick Morris says Obama will never get another major piece of legislation passed.
[00:39:25.740 --> 00:39:28.261]  Not unless he sets off a nuke in a major U.S.
[00:39:28.261 --> 00:39:29.542]  city.
[00:39:29.542 --> 00:39:31.422]  I agree with Michael Savage.
[00:39:31.422 --> 00:39:37.565]  I'd like to hear Glenn Beck talk about false flag terror like Michael Savage did.
[00:39:37.565 --> 00:39:40.006]  Tell the truth once in your life.
[00:39:40.006 --> 00:39:40.946]  Back you up, Savage.
[00:39:42.605 --> 00:39:44.766]  But before we do that, I want to play Ron Paul.
[00:39:44.766 --> 00:39:51.230]  This is Ron Paul at the campaign for liberty speech he gave.
[00:39:51.230 --> 00:39:54.012]  He was representative of Ron Paul's as the CIA.
[00:39:55.526 --> 00:39:58.468]  Has, in effect, carried out a coup against the U.S.
[00:39:58.468 --> 00:40:02.350]  government, and the intelligence agency needs to be, quote, taken out.
[00:40:02.350 --> 00:40:04.551]  Boy, Kennedy said that, and they blew his head off.
[00:40:04.551 --> 00:40:12.035]  Speaking to an audience of like-minded libertarians at the Campaign for Liberty regional conference in Atlanta over the past weekend, I can't wait to get him back on in two weeks to talk about this.
[00:40:12.035 --> 00:40:13.656]  He joins us once a month.
[00:40:13.656 --> 00:40:16.177]  The Texas Republican said, there's been a coup.
[00:40:16.177 --> 00:40:17.558]  Have you heard?
[00:40:17.558 --> 00:40:19.259]  It's the CIA coup.
[00:40:19.259 --> 00:40:20.499]  The CIA runs everything.
[00:40:20.499 --> 00:40:21.400]  They run the military.
[00:40:22.000 --> 00:40:27.444]  They're the ones who are over there lobbing missiles and bombs on countries.
[00:40:27.444 --> 00:40:31.688]  And of course the CIA is every bit as secretive as the Federal Reserve.
[00:40:31.688 --> 00:40:38.573]  And yet, think of the harm they have done since they were established after World War II.
[00:40:38.573 --> 00:40:40.394]  They are the government unto themselves.
[00:40:40.394 --> 00:40:42.716]  They're in business, in the drug business.
[00:40:42.716 --> 00:40:44.257]  They take out dictators.
[00:40:44.257 --> 00:40:47.080]  We need to take out the CIA.
[00:40:47.080 --> 00:40:49.321]  Ron Paul, we love you!
[00:40:50.430 --> 00:40:53.192]  You are a man of courage.
[00:40:53.192 --> 00:40:55.474]  You are a man of strength.
[00:40:55.474 --> 00:40:57.596]  You are a man of honor.
[00:40:57.596 --> 00:40:59.077]  You are real.
[00:40:59.077 --> 00:41:02.580]  You are bona fide.
[00:41:02.580 --> 00:41:11.267]  Ron Paul can't prove 9-11 is an inside job, but he said he wants a new investigation and there are questions.
[00:41:11.267 --> 00:41:19.234]  But he says, even if you believe the official story, the CIA created Osama bin Laden,
[00:41:21.107 --> 00:41:31.881]  And allowed him to attack, and then we attacked the wrong country, Iraq, where none of the hijackers came from, when 15 came from Saudi Arabia.
[00:41:31.881 --> 00:41:37.488]  But then every time he comes on this show, he says, Alex, we know they will stage things without me even asking.
[00:41:39.150 --> 00:41:40.912]  So, we know where his heart really is.
[00:41:40.912 --> 00:41:43.995]  The point is, he knows what he's doing.
[00:41:43.995 --> 00:41:47.638]  And Ron Paul is the real deal.
[00:41:47.638 --> 00:41:50.621]  Judge Andrew Napolitano is the real deal.
[00:41:50.621 --> 00:41:54.685]  He's got a Fox show, but on business, with about one-tenth the viewers.
[00:41:54.685 --> 00:41:57.388]  You gave him a daily show, it'd be more popular than Beck.
[00:41:57.388 --> 00:41:58.509]  He's a scholar.
[00:41:58.509 --> 00:41:59.230]  He's for real.
[00:42:00.515 --> 00:42:04.177]  I'm not attacking Beck because he's got a big radio show and a big TV show.
[00:42:04.177 --> 00:42:09.759]  I'm attacking Beck because he's at the head of our movement and is trying to take it over.
[00:42:09.759 --> 00:42:17.262]  Just like I attacked President Barack Obama because I knew he was a fraud.
[00:42:17.262 --> 00:42:22.364]  If somebody's a fraud and working for Wall Street, I go after them.
[00:42:22.364 --> 00:42:24.845]  You don't hear Glenn Beck saying audit the Fed or go after the Fed.
[00:42:26.065 --> 00:42:27.226]  Again, I'm trying to shut up about him.
[00:42:27.226 --> 00:42:31.288]  It's just, it's so clear to me, and for some people it's not clear.
[00:42:31.288 --> 00:42:38.813]  That's why we're going to make this mini-documentary, The Glenn Beck Deception.
[00:42:38.813 --> 00:42:48.819]  In fact, I was going to come out with Police State 4, The Rise of FEMA, March 1st, but I'm going to go ahead and have it come out in later March, maybe even April now.
[00:42:48.819 --> 00:42:52.161]  I'm suspending that film right now.
[00:42:56.567 --> 00:43:03.714]  And we're going full-time back to make this Glenn Beck deception.
[00:43:03.714 --> 00:43:08.279]  Because I've got to fire on him right now, and people won't listen.
[00:43:08.279 --> 00:43:09.100]  I will be attacked.
[00:43:09.100 --> 00:43:10.341]  It will be unpopular with many.
[00:43:10.341 --> 00:43:12.524]  If I was smart, I would have cozied up to him years ago.
[00:43:14.275 --> 00:43:20.986]  You know, I basically don't get on Clear Channel interviews as much, and on other shows that would have me on routinely, you notice I'm not on them anymore.
[00:43:20.986 --> 00:43:22.969]  Because of this, I've been told, basically.
[00:43:22.969 --> 00:43:23.610]  I don't care!
[00:43:23.610 --> 00:43:24.612]  I don't care!
[00:43:24.612 --> 00:43:25.594]  I don't care!
[00:43:25.594 --> 00:43:26.515]  I don't care!
[00:43:27.685 --> 00:43:28.546]  What happens?
[00:43:28.546 --> 00:43:30.607]  I'm not here trying to win a popularity contest.
[00:43:30.607 --> 00:43:34.830]  Every time I have major media here, they say, well, when do you think you'll be big time on national TV?
[00:43:34.830 --> 00:43:36.331]  You know, do you try to get on TV?
[00:43:36.331 --> 00:43:36.991]  Do you try to?
[00:43:36.991 --> 00:43:39.193]  No, we don't want to be on national TV.
[00:43:39.193 --> 00:43:40.293]  We don't care.
[00:43:40.293 --> 00:43:42.595]  We don't care about being big stars.
[00:43:42.595 --> 00:43:49.199]  I was offered deals by two of the biggest syndicators in the country eight years ago and 10 years ago, respectively.
[00:43:49.199 --> 00:43:51.401]  I was offered to be the new Rush Limbaugh.
[00:43:51.401 --> 00:43:54.083]  I was offered to be Glenn Beck, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:43:54.083 --> 00:43:55.484]  And I said no.
[00:43:55.484 --> 00:43:56.945]  And it wasn't hard to say no.
[00:43:58.186 --> 00:44:00.708]  The only thing I've got is my integrity.
[00:44:00.708 --> 00:44:08.394]  The only thing I've got is I'm real.
[00:44:08.394 --> 00:44:10.456]  I want to make history for freedom.
[00:44:10.456 --> 00:44:12.978]  I want my children to grow up free.
[00:44:12.978 --> 00:44:15.701]  I don't care about some big giant sack of money.
[00:44:17.116 --> 00:44:18.417]  Or people knowing who I am.
[00:44:18.417 --> 00:44:20.998]  I can't stand losing my privacy.
[00:44:20.998 --> 00:44:22.259]  Let me give the New Order news.
[00:44:22.259 --> 00:44:23.459]  I can be in England.
[00:44:23.459 --> 00:44:25.480]  I can be in Central America.
[00:44:25.480 --> 00:44:26.320]  I can be in Canada.
[00:44:26.320 --> 00:44:27.341]  I can be in Montana.
[00:44:27.341 --> 00:44:28.402]  I can be anywhere.
[00:44:28.402 --> 00:44:32.483]  And cars stop all over the place and get out and say Alex Jones and shake my hand.
[00:44:32.483 --> 00:44:35.065]  We've already blown you people to bits.
[00:44:35.065 --> 00:44:35.545]  Look at you.
[00:44:35.545 --> 00:44:37.906]  Your full program is in retreat right now.
[00:44:37.906 --> 00:44:39.027]  You're desperate.
[00:44:39.027 --> 00:44:42.108]  You're trying to con people back into the left-right paradigm.
[00:44:42.108 --> 00:44:43.849]  It's not going to work.
[00:44:43.849 --> 00:44:44.669]  It's over.
[00:44:44.669 --> 00:44:45.610]  We've devastated you.
[00:44:47.128 --> 00:44:51.151]  The question is, though, how fast can we beat these people?
[00:44:51.151 --> 00:44:58.696]  We've got Benedict Arnold in our midst, in our general staff, and that's why we're losing a lot of battles and winning some as well.
[00:44:58.696 --> 00:45:05.400]  But we've got enemies in the gates, enemies in our camp, COINTELPRO, running operations in all directions.
[00:45:05.400 --> 00:45:07.161]  Print me the encyclopedia on Benedict Arnold.
[00:45:07.161 --> 00:45:10.764]  I want to read about Benedict Arnold on air for people.
[00:45:10.764 --> 00:45:15.607]  And all that matters is we win the war in the end, and that the Benedict Arnold
[00:45:17.961 --> 00:45:25.106]  And all his pumps and all his pimps be exposed.
[00:45:25.106 --> 00:45:26.727]  So I'm coming straight at you, buddy.
[00:45:26.727 --> 00:45:29.309]  You need to know that.
[00:45:29.309 --> 00:45:33.472]  And my listeners are coming straight at you.
[00:45:33.472 --> 00:45:34.893]  Because we understand what you're doing.
[00:45:35.984 --> 00:45:39.746]  Alright, here is Congressman Ron Paul who we salute.
[00:45:39.746 --> 00:45:40.967]  This is courage.
[00:45:40.967 --> 00:45:42.188]  This is honor.
[00:45:42.188 --> 00:45:43.489]  This is real.
[00:45:43.489 --> 00:45:52.595]  Here's Congressman Ron Paul on Abolish the CIA, how they've had a coup d'etat over our government and our military, and how we need to, quote, take them out.
[00:45:52.595 --> 00:45:53.215]  Here it is.
[00:45:53.215 --> 00:45:58.498]  I mean, they're almost like they lived in a different world.
[00:45:58.498 --> 00:46:01.620]  The military's down, the morale is down, the money is in the air.
[00:46:01.620 --> 00:46:03.922]  They're going looking for a couple more wars to fight.
[00:46:04.762 --> 00:46:06.743]  It makes no sense whatsoever.
[00:46:06.743 --> 00:46:07.964]  But no, we don't have to worry.
[00:46:07.964 --> 00:46:12.606]  It's not the military anymore because there's been a coup.
[00:46:12.606 --> 00:46:13.547]  Have you heard?
[00:46:13.547 --> 00:46:15.288]  It's the CIA coup.
[00:46:15.288 --> 00:46:16.929]  The CIA runs everything.
[00:46:16.929 --> 00:46:18.090]  They run the military.
[00:46:18.090 --> 00:46:23.192]  They're the ones who are over there lobbing missiles and bombs on these countries.
[00:46:23.192 --> 00:46:24.893]  It's not even the military that does it.
[00:46:24.893 --> 00:46:26.114]  The CIA runs this.
[00:46:26.647 --> 00:46:32.448]  And of course, the CIA has never been as secret as the Federal Reserve.
[00:46:32.448 --> 00:46:38.230]  And yet, think of the harm that they have done since they were established since World War II.
[00:46:38.230 --> 00:46:40.370]  They are a government unto themselves.
[00:46:40.370 --> 00:46:41.330]  They're in businesses.
[00:46:41.330 --> 00:46:42.771]  They're in drug businesses.
[00:46:42.771 --> 00:46:45.471]  And they take on different kinds of things.
[00:46:50.211 --> 00:46:52.533]  Again, he said, take the CIA out there at the end.
[00:46:52.533 --> 00:46:53.614]  That was shot from the crowd.
[00:46:53.614 --> 00:46:55.456]  I'm trying to find a better version of that video.
[00:46:55.456 --> 00:46:57.137]  If you've got it, please send it to us.
[00:46:57.137 --> 00:46:59.479]  We'd like to include it in a film.
[00:46:59.479 --> 00:47:10.068]  But people wonder who Tommy Pallotta is, movie producer that's put me in a few movies, Scanner Darkly and Waking Life with Rick Linklater as the director.
[00:47:10.068 --> 00:47:17.435]  Tommy Pallotta, when he was at college at UT, shot the video you're about to hear the audio from.
[00:47:18.564 --> 00:47:26.207]  With a long-standing show that ran for more than 15 years on AXS TV in Austin.
[00:47:26.207 --> 00:47:33.310]  This is Ron Paul in 1989 being asked about the CIA.
[00:47:33.310 --> 00:47:34.571]  Here's that clip.
[00:47:34.571 --> 00:47:41.594]  Let's talk about what could be the most explosive issue of this campaign.
[00:47:42.615 --> 00:47:46.936]  If the mass media would get a hold of and do something about it, but they're covering it up.
[00:47:46.936 --> 00:47:52.857]  And that is the, you were talking about the government involvement in drugs.
[00:47:52.857 --> 00:48:06.320]  There have been government investigations, there have been private investigations, and we've interviewed a lot of people, ex-CIA people, who have talked about the CIA involvement in drug operations for many decades.
[00:48:06.320 --> 00:48:10.201]  It's public knowledge, so once again, the media are not saying anything about it.
[00:48:11.099 --> 00:48:22.988]  That Oliver North and his people involved with the Contras have been running drug operations, cocaine primarily, bringing it back into the United States.
[00:48:22.988 --> 00:48:35.778]  And there are other investigations which show that George Bush's office, Donald Gregg particularly, and the people he was working with, have been supervising an enormous drug operation
[00:48:36.701 --> 00:48:46.917]  Which, once again, was sending illegal arms down to the Contras and elsewhere, and bringing cocaine and other types of drugs back into the United States.
[00:48:46.917 --> 00:48:50.443]  But the Democrats aren't talking about this.
[00:48:51.841 --> 00:48:53.702]  Are the Libertarians talking about this?
[00:48:53.702 --> 00:48:59.066]  And do they put this into the framework of the drug law situation that you're talking about?
[00:48:59.066 --> 00:49:00.186]  We talk about it a whole lot.
[00:49:00.186 --> 00:49:03.709]  Of course, we always have the trouble of getting the attention that we think it deserves.
[00:49:03.709 --> 00:49:05.790]  There have been a few Democrats that have talked about it.
[00:49:05.790 --> 00:49:08.011]  Senator Kerry's office has done some work on it.
[00:49:08.011 --> 00:49:09.672]  He's done a lot of the investigation.
[00:49:09.672 --> 00:49:10.213]  Right.
[00:49:10.213 --> 00:49:12.054]  And I think he's on to something.
[00:49:12.054 --> 00:49:18.878]  And I think we've gotten some other information too, of course, that George, or the CIA, has given Noriega over the years $200,000 a year.
[00:49:20.539 --> 00:49:20.940]  Sure, yes.
[00:49:39.241 --> 00:49:39.741]  We're good to go.
[00:50:05.829 --> 00:50:06.310]  Interesting.
[00:50:06.310 --> 00:50:20.380]  Can you imagine it would alarm a few of us in this country if all of a sudden we knew that the leader in the Soviet Union would be the head KGB agent and here we take our head CIA agent and put him, you know, potentially the head of our entire country.
[00:50:20.380 --> 00:50:31.289]  Unfortunately, I wish that we could get this information out and I continue to talk about it, but I sadly believe that there will be very little said, which means that the Democrat
[00:50:32.049 --> 00:50:35.611]  We're going to come back with the rest of this, but again, this was shot in 88, released in 89.
[00:50:35.611 --> 00:50:38.553]  Austin Access TV interview, TV show that Tommy Pallotta worked on.
[00:50:38.553 --> 00:50:41.095]  Tommy Pallotta, from talking to him, I believe, ran camera on this shoot.
[00:51:01.735 --> 00:51:08.601]  AaronAqua.com is your one-stop shop for some of the most affordable air and water purification systems available on the market today.
[00:51:08.601 --> 00:51:17.408]  AaronAqua.com knows exactly what doesn't belong in our air and our water, and they know exactly how to help you rid your home or office of these harmful toxins.
[00:51:17.408 --> 00:51:22.171]  Did you know that your skin actually absorbs more chlorine while you shower than from the water you drink?
[00:51:22.171 --> 00:51:26.095]  AaronAqua.com can help you eliminate dangerous chlorine from your water.
[00:51:26.095 --> 00:51:30.238]  AaronAqua.com carries atmospheric water generators, glass water bottles,
[00:51:30.518 --> 00:51:30.898]  We're good.
[00:52:02.179 --> 00:52:06.208]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[00:52:06.208 --> 00:52:09.455]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[00:52:09.455 --> 00:52:10.877]  As we're finishing off this agenda...
[00:52:11.759 --> 00:52:15.000]  We're pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[00:52:15.000 --> 00:52:20.621]  Tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[00:52:20.621 --> 00:52:25.823]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[00:52:25.823 --> 00:52:35.805]  For the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation, the criminal offshore cartel, hell-bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government.
[00:52:35.925 --> 00:52:38.267]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists!
[00:52:38.267 --> 00:52:39.868]  They're asking for more matches!
[00:52:39.868 --> 00:52:42.329]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[00:52:42.329 --> 00:52:44.450]  Today seems like nobody does care.
[00:52:44.450 --> 00:52:49.594]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[00:52:49.594 --> 00:52:54.617]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com.
[00:52:54.617 --> 00:52:58.719]  Or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:53:00.854 --> 00:53:05.259]  Americans have heard much about change in recent times and are now waking up to the truth.
[00:53:05.259 --> 00:53:08.422]  Well, here's a few facts about your food you may want to change.
[00:53:08.422 --> 00:53:17.511]  Did you know that nearly 100% of the food on store shelves comes from a few corporations and that most is genetically engineered, chemically sprayed, and transported great distances?
[00:53:18.012 --> 00:53:25.237]  Baker Creek Heirloom Seed Company, like you, wants to see Americans change and take control of their own food supply, one seed at a time.
[00:53:25.237 --> 00:53:32.081]  Over 12 years, we've become America's premier supplier of pure, non-GMO seeds with over 1,400 varieties.
[00:53:32.081 --> 00:53:40.847]  Gardeners and homesteaders know Baker Creek offers some of the most popular seed collection kits, like our large heirloom kit with 60 full-size seed packets for only $99.
[00:53:40.847 --> 00:53:46.991]  The kit contains 25 types of vegetables and comes packaged in a metal can for long-term storage for just $99.
[00:53:48.052 --> 00:53:48.613]  I think so.
[00:54:08.427 --> 00:54:11.751]  Alright, let's go back and let Ron Paul finish up from 1988.
[00:54:11.751 --> 00:54:25.307]  Austin Access TV, that was a program that ran for more than 15 years that two UT professors ran, Tommy Pallotta for four years at UT, before he went on a few years later to make Slacker with Rick Linkletter.
[00:54:27.092 --> 00:54:30.394]  He was there running and researching on this particular show.
[00:54:30.394 --> 00:54:36.038]  Just an example of the great people that I've gotten a chance to know living here in Austin, Texas.
[00:54:36.038 --> 00:54:37.780]  Here's Ron Paul.
[00:54:37.780 --> 00:54:44.164]  Now again, last weekend he exposed them for CIA narcotics trafficking and said, abolish them, that they've had a coup over our government.
[00:54:44.164 --> 00:54:44.985]  And here he is, 22 years ago.
[00:54:52.304 --> 00:54:54.727]  Twenty-two years ago, telling the truth.
[00:54:54.727 --> 00:54:55.107]  Here it is.
[00:55:10.726 --> 00:55:13.027]  Well, there you go, 22 years ago, telling the truth.
[00:55:40.666 --> 00:55:43.087]  And 22 years later telling the truth.
[00:55:43.087 --> 00:55:58.056]  Here's Savage telling the truth about Obama planning to stage terror attacks, but Glenn Beck says anybody that talks about government-sponsored terror needs to get in trouble, just like Cass Sunstein, the White House regulations are, says you need to be arrested.
[00:55:58.056 --> 00:56:03.319]  What, you want to arrest Michael Savage?
[00:56:03.319 --> 00:56:05.060]  Now I'll make another prediction.
[00:56:05.060 --> 00:56:06.281]  I predict that very soon
[00:56:07.538 --> 00:56:12.780]  Obama will create a crisis along the lines of the Reichstag fire.
[00:56:12.780 --> 00:56:30.505]  I don't know what form it will take, but I believe that once the minions are seen for what they are, Rahm Emanuel and his gang will set off a Reichstag fire in this country of some kind, and they will recall the military dictatorship of Lincoln and Stanton during the Civil War, when civilian suspects were arrested without warrant.
[00:56:31.212 --> 00:56:34.854]  I will tell you as I sit here, I fear that every night as I go to sleep.
[00:56:34.854 --> 00:56:43.059]  I put nothing past these agitators who have suddenly seized control of the most powerful economy and the most powerful military on earth.
[00:56:43.059 --> 00:56:49.383]  Know, my friends, I am losing a great deal of sleep every night because I do see this happening right before my eyes.
[00:56:49.383 --> 00:56:51.064]  Again, I... Alright, alright.
[00:56:51.064 --> 00:56:52.305]  He goes on and on.
[00:56:52.305 --> 00:56:54.626]  The point is, he said that 11 months ago.
[00:56:54.626 --> 00:56:55.647]  I've been saying that, of course.
[00:56:56.783 --> 00:56:57.283]  We're good to go.
[00:57:15.334 --> 00:57:26.278]  Look for the terror attack before the midterm election coming up in 7, 8, 9 months.
[00:57:26.278 --> 00:57:35.621]  7, 8, 9 months from now, before the elections coming up in November, look for them to have a devastating terror attack.
[00:57:35.621 --> 00:57:39.922]  It could be domestic, it could be against our ships, they could blame it on Iran.
[00:57:39.922 --> 00:57:41.743]  Look for that.
[00:57:42.728 --> 00:57:49.816]  And they now admit in the MIAC and Homeland Security reports, the whole Homeland Security system has been set up for the American people.
[00:57:51.209 --> 00:57:53.870]  You will not hear Glenn Beck telling the truth like Michael Savage.
[00:57:53.870 --> 00:58:01.173]  You will hear him say anybody that says the government may stage an attack is a traitor who wants to kill Obama.
[00:58:01.173 --> 00:58:03.534]  No one is talking about killing Obama.
[00:58:03.534 --> 00:58:05.475]  I don't want anything to happen to Obama.
[00:58:05.475 --> 00:58:15.199]  That's one of the false flags the government could pull and make him this big messianic hero and then push through his agenda and use that for riots and then a crackdown.
[00:58:15.199 --> 00:58:15.339]  No.
[00:58:16.633 --> 00:58:19.154]  I do not want anything to happen to Barack Obama.
[00:58:19.154 --> 00:58:25.096]  Just like I want nothing to happen to George W. Bush or Bush Senior or any of these crooks.
[00:58:25.096 --> 00:58:31.198]  Now, one of the only cards they've got is bio-attack, chemical attack, nuke attack, massive terror attack.
[00:58:31.198 --> 00:58:37.140]  And notice Obama, two weeks ago, signed an executive order getting ready for massive biological attack.
[00:58:37.140 --> 00:58:42.362]  We'll be right back with your phone calls in a second hour.
[00:58:42.362 --> 00:58:44.083]  You are listening to GCN.
[00:58:45.865 --> 00:58:48.012]  Visit GCNlive.com today!
[00:58:51.206 --> 00:58:54.227]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[00:58:54.227 --> 00:58:59.550]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[00:58:59.550 --> 00:59:01.610]  My answer would be all I can get.
[00:59:01.610 --> 00:59:06.613]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[00:59:06.613 --> 00:59:07.793]  How much do you want?
[00:59:07.793 --> 00:59:08.914]  When do you want it?
[00:59:08.914 --> 00:59:10.794]  Now or after the battle starts?
[00:59:10.794 --> 00:59:11.875]  When will you need it?
[00:59:11.875 --> 00:59:14.076]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[00:59:14.076 --> 00:59:15.416]  Will there be any food?
[00:59:15.416 --> 00:59:16.717]  Will it make your children sick?
[00:59:16.937 --> 00:59:22.203]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[00:59:22.203 --> 00:59:25.788]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[00:59:25.788 --> 00:59:29.612]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[00:59:29.612 --> 00:59:30.833]  How much will you need?
[00:59:30.833 --> 00:59:31.735]  We don't know.
[00:59:31.735 --> 00:59:32.836]  How much do you want?
[00:59:32.836 --> 00:59:33.777]  All you can get.
[00:59:33.777 --> 00:59:34.578]  I'm Alex Jones.
[00:59:34.858 --> 00:59:37.899]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.
[00:59:37.899 --> 00:59:40.099]  Call 1-800-409-5633 or check it out on the web at efoodsdirect.com.
[00:59:40.099 --> 00:59:41.119]  Again, that number, 1-800-409-5633.
[00:59:41.119 --> 00:59:42.320]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:59:42.320 --> 00:59:44.140]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:05.447 --> 01:00:10.290]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[01:00:10.290 --> 01:00:11.871]  You want answers?
[01:00:11.871 --> 01:00:13.432]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:13.432 --> 01:00:17.615]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:17.615 --> 01:00:21.697]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:40.485 --> 01:00:48.634]  Man, I'm looking at PrisonPlanet.com and TheInfoWars.com articles that Kurt Nemo, Paul Watson, Steve Watson, Aaron Dykes are writing.
[01:00:48.634 --> 01:00:49.675]  These guys are on fire!
[01:00:49.675 --> 01:00:53.319]  They're writing five, six bombshell articles a day apiece sometimes.
[01:00:53.319 --> 01:00:55.701]  They are all just devastating to the New World Order.
[01:00:55.701 --> 01:00:56.782]  We're going to be going over those.
[01:00:57.683 --> 01:01:00.544]  Also, great news, UN abandons Copenhagen deadline.
[01:01:00.544 --> 01:01:02.145]  Country's not signing on.
[01:01:02.145 --> 01:01:05.687]  They claimed they were going to sign on later and that it hadn't totally failed.
[01:01:05.687 --> 01:01:07.908]  Now it's completely imploded.
[01:01:07.908 --> 01:01:17.272]  London Guardian spokesman says deadline has gone soft and the image is a de-inflated balloon with the image of the Copenhagen summit on it.
[01:01:17.272 --> 01:01:18.332]  The logo.
[01:01:18.332 --> 01:01:21.674]  I mean, they are just in full routed retreat.
[01:01:21.674 --> 01:01:24.195]  We are having massive victories against the New World Order.
[01:01:25.117 --> 01:01:26.818]  Let's go to Seth in California.
[01:01:26.818 --> 01:01:28.839]  You're on the air, Seth.
[01:01:28.839 --> 01:01:30.480]  Yo, what's happening, Alex Jones?
[01:01:30.480 --> 01:01:32.682]  Thank you very much for what you do, man.
[01:01:32.682 --> 01:01:33.362]  Thank you.
[01:01:33.362 --> 01:01:34.383]  Thank you.
[01:01:34.383 --> 01:01:38.145]  I think I've been listening for about a year now, and you know, you've really opened my mind.
[01:01:38.145 --> 01:01:47.331]  I'm so excited for the Glenn Beck thing, because my parents are really big into Glenn Beck, so I just can't wait for next week to kind of, like, booyah!
[01:01:49.767 --> 01:01:51.928]  I just really want to say thank you for what you do.
[01:01:51.928 --> 01:02:02.853]  I spend a lot of time online posting your articles on Facebook and Dig and all the other social networking sites I can get them on and do what I can to spread the word, man, so thank you.
[01:02:02.853 --> 01:02:07.495]  Well, do you agree with me that Beck is a key operative and has to be targeted?
[01:02:07.495 --> 01:02:08.755]  Yeah, that video.
[01:02:08.755 --> 01:02:11.356]  He's a neocon, not a libertarian.
[01:02:11.356 --> 01:02:15.198]  I mean, you can't watch that and just not see right through it completely.
[01:02:15.862 --> 01:02:21.915]  And him crying and blubbering and arguing with idiots that book, it just, the whole thing just creates a division.
[01:02:22.779 --> 01:02:25.100]  It doesn't want people to critically think about the issues.
[01:02:25.100 --> 01:02:26.680]  They're just being parrots.
[01:02:26.680 --> 01:02:43.766]  Well, I'm creating a special email because we need people to find us all the times he's attacked Ron Paul and patriots and gun owners and the times he's called for higher taxes and the times he said that he met with Bush secretly and got orders from him and all the different things he's done supporting the Patriot Act against U.S.
[01:02:43.766 --> 01:02:46.927]  citizens, whitewashing the MIAC and Homeland Security reports.
[01:02:47.407 --> 01:02:51.869]  I need everybody to help us research and pull more of this, because there's always more.
[01:02:51.869 --> 01:02:57.011]  I'm always shocked by what I didn't know about, because I haven't really been paying attention to him.
[01:02:57.011 --> 01:03:01.253]  Just kind of half-way, keeping half an eye trained on him.
[01:03:01.253 --> 01:03:04.914]  Send it to Viper at InfoWars.com.
[01:03:04.914 --> 01:03:05.355]  Viper.
[01:03:05.355 --> 01:03:08.056]  He is a viper in our bosom.
[01:03:08.056 --> 01:03:09.196]  A viper in our midst.
[01:03:09.196 --> 01:03:14.859]  So everybody send your Beck research to Viper at InfoWars.com.
[01:03:14.859 --> 01:03:15.299]  Help us.
[01:03:15.999 --> 01:03:17.900]  So that we can put all these clips together.
[01:03:17.900 --> 01:03:21.623]  Viper at InfoWars.com.
[01:03:21.623 --> 01:03:26.566]  You know, and another easy way that I've found to share you guys' stuff is it's called Add This.
[01:03:26.566 --> 01:03:29.568]  It's like this easy thing to put on your web browser.
[01:03:29.568 --> 01:03:33.290]  You just click a button and you can post articles anywhere, you know?
[01:03:33.290 --> 01:03:37.873]  And so, like you were just saying, Curt Nemo, Paul Alton, you guys are writing some amazing stuff, man.
[01:03:37.873 --> 01:03:41.636]  So I just keep putting it out there wherever I can because people need to wake up.
[01:03:42.520 --> 01:03:43.721]  It's frustrating.
[01:03:43.721 --> 01:03:46.123]  They know they're being brainwashed and they say, isn't that weird?
[01:03:46.123 --> 01:03:49.485]  And they turn on the TV and just go right back to it.
[01:03:49.485 --> 01:03:51.747]  You guys are fighting a good fight and thank you very much.
[01:03:51.747 --> 01:03:53.088]  Keep it up, my man.
[01:03:53.088 --> 01:03:53.988]  God bless you.
[01:03:53.988 --> 01:04:00.033]  The good news, Seth, is that they're now having to basically act like the real patriots.
[01:04:00.033 --> 01:04:02.054]  Act like Ron Paul, behave like me.
[01:04:03.044 --> 01:04:04.886]  But only about half the time.
[01:04:04.886 --> 01:04:06.547]  Then the rest of the time, they slip in.
[01:04:06.547 --> 01:04:07.888]  We need new wars.
[01:04:07.888 --> 01:04:09.329]  The real terrorists want to get us.
[01:04:09.329 --> 01:04:10.930]  The Patriot Act is good.
[01:04:10.930 --> 01:04:13.432]  Torture is good.
[01:04:13.432 --> 01:04:16.155]  We need new taxes, you know, to pay off the bankers.
[01:04:16.155 --> 01:04:17.416]  We need the banker bailout.
[01:04:18.800 --> 01:04:27.228]  I mean, he is on record for the banker bailout, and then I've seen the clips, I need to pull them again, where lately he says he was against the bailout.
[01:04:27.228 --> 01:04:31.393]  See, not just that he was for the bailout, he now lies and says he never was.
[01:04:31.393 --> 01:04:33.415]  He said, we had to have that bailout.
[01:04:33.415 --> 01:04:34.676]  Go ahead.
[01:04:34.676 --> 01:04:35.817]  My mom even talked about this.
[01:04:35.817 --> 01:04:37.299]  She said he apologized for it.
[01:04:37.299 --> 01:04:38.800]  He was wrong.
[01:04:38.800 --> 01:04:40.482]  He made a mistake, you know?
[01:04:42.589 --> 01:04:44.611]  People are so caught up too in the paradigm.
[01:04:44.611 --> 01:04:47.354]  You're talking about Ron Paul and the CIA and the drugs.
[01:04:47.354 --> 01:04:48.615]  It wasn't just Bush.
[01:04:48.615 --> 01:04:52.860]  Air America was flying the coke into Arkansas when Clinton was governor.
[01:04:52.860 --> 01:04:53.801]  You know, it's all the same.
[01:04:53.801 --> 01:04:55.623]  They're all in bed together.
[01:04:55.623 --> 01:04:58.847]  Absolutely, and it's that simple fact we've got to get out to everybody.
[01:05:00.489 --> 01:05:07.474]  This is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about the Ecola Blue Atmospheric Water Generator that produces pure drinking water right from the humidity in the air.
[01:05:07.474 --> 01:05:09.575]  No, this isn't science fiction, it's very real.
[01:05:09.575 --> 01:05:11.796]  I know because I use one every day in my own home.
[01:05:11.796 --> 01:05:13.458]  And it's available right now to you.
[01:05:13.458 --> 01:05:17.940]  Because you know exactly where your water comes from with Ecola Blue, you'll know what's in your cup.
[01:05:17.940 --> 01:05:20.202]  Clean, great tasting water without all the pollutants.

[01:05:31.285 --> 01:05:34.126]  The Ecolablue 28 is easy to use and economical.
[01:05:34.126 --> 01:05:36.847]  Generate your own pure water from the humidity in the air.
[01:05:36.847 --> 01:05:44.009]  This system is free of chemicals and uses a multi-stage filtration system including reverse osmosis, carbon filters, and ultraviolet lights.
[01:05:44.309 --> 01:05:48.031]  Order now and claim your water independence today by calling a Coloblue at 1-800-691-6043.
[01:05:48.031 --> 01:05:48.291]  That's 1-800-691-6043.
[01:05:48.291 --> 01:05:50.212]  Or visit a Coloblue on the web at www.ecoloble.com today.
[01:06:00.177 --> 01:06:04.741]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[01:06:04.741 --> 01:06:05.642]  Number one.
[01:06:05.642 --> 01:06:09.065]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[01:06:09.065 --> 01:06:09.925]  Number two.
[01:06:09.925 --> 01:06:14.830]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[01:06:14.830 --> 01:06:15.570]  It's true.
[01:06:15.570 --> 01:06:20.434]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[01:06:20.434 --> 01:06:20.895]  Number three.
[01:06:21.255 --> 01:06:24.838]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[01:06:24.838 --> 01:06:29.562]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[01:06:29.562 --> 01:06:32.324]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[01:06:32.324 --> 01:06:36.788]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[01:06:36.788 --> 01:06:40.932]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[01:06:40.932 --> 01:06:45.696]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[01:06:45.976 --> 01:06:50.138]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[01:06:50.138 --> 01:06:51.939]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[01:06:51.939 --> 01:06:54.181]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun.
[01:06:54.181 --> 01:06:56.542]  So go to mysolarbackup.com or call 1-877-327-0365.
[01:07:01.837 --> 01:07:05.798]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about the Silver Lungs Generator.
[01:07:05.798 --> 01:07:14.661]  Now you can produce pure and endless colloidal silver and deliver the solution directly into the bloodstream by breathing the solution through the lungs.
[01:07:14.661 --> 01:07:19.282]  The respiratory system is the first line of defense for airborne pathogens and viruses.
[01:07:19.282 --> 01:07:30.106]  The Silver Lungs Generator infuses the respiratory system with your self-produced nano-silver solutions and also delivers the silver nanoparticles instantly into the bloodstream.
[01:07:30.746 --> 01:07:40.248]  With continued legislation threatening the sale of nano-silver products, you can now produce pure and endless colloidal silver with the Silver Lungs Generator.
[01:07:40.248 --> 01:07:45.690]  Very easy to follow step-by-step instructions are provided, making production fast and simple.
[01:07:45.690 --> 01:07:53.171]  Go to www.silverlungs.com today and learn more about the breakthrough technology of the Silver Lungs Generator.
[01:07:53.171 --> 01:07:55.912]  That's www.silverlungs.com.
[01:08:01.416 --> 01:08:04.160]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[01:08:04.160 --> 01:08:09.650]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:08:09.650 --> 01:08:12.915]  America and the world are waking up right now.
[01:08:14.309 --> 01:08:18.251]  They're waking up to the private banking syndicate that rules our planet.
[01:08:18.251 --> 01:08:24.794]  They're waking up to the major intelligence agencies, CIA, Mossad, MI6.
[01:08:24.794 --> 01:08:27.395]  All the major governments control the narcotics trade.
[01:08:27.395 --> 01:08:29.096]  That's why they keep drugs illegal.
[01:08:29.096 --> 01:08:35.639]  They keep the price high and unregulated so they can have larger profits off the black market.
[01:08:35.639 --> 01:08:39.401]  They're waking up that the major political parties of every country are controlled.
[01:08:40.856 --> 01:08:54.005]  I haven't even gotten to the news stack yet today that the Supreme Court has ruled that corporations can give unlimited political contributions, but private citizens still can't.
[01:08:54.005 --> 01:08:56.167]  See, they're tying your hands.
[01:08:56.167 --> 01:09:06.434]  The original campaign finance reform of what, 2002, allowed corporations to give more money, but for citizens to give less.
[01:09:06.434 --> 01:09:10.397]  Everything is about tying your hands politically.
[01:09:12.608 --> 01:09:14.969]  That's the bottom line of what's going on.
[01:09:14.969 --> 01:09:16.771]  UN abandons Copenhagen deadline.
[01:09:16.771 --> 01:09:18.211]  Countries not signing on.
[01:09:18.211 --> 01:09:20.373]  Spokesman says the deadline has gone soft.
[01:09:20.373 --> 01:09:25.936]  The entire program of global taxation through carbon dioxide has imploded.
[01:09:25.936 --> 01:09:28.298]  It's rolled over dead.
[01:09:28.298 --> 01:09:32.060]  They're still moving forward with state and city taxes with their operatives in your local area.
[01:09:32.060 --> 01:09:33.021]  Fight them.
[01:09:33.021 --> 01:09:35.222]  Expose their fraud.
[01:09:35.222 --> 01:09:36.403]  But we are beginning to win.
[01:09:40.566 --> 01:09:45.308]  Swine flu hoax is an admitted mass fraud and is imploding.
[01:09:45.308 --> 01:09:47.389]  Everything is imploding for these people.
[01:09:47.389 --> 01:09:55.132]  Their government takeover of healthcare is in desperate straits, hanging by the last thread of a thread.
[01:09:55.132 --> 01:09:58.193]  Everything they do is turning to dust.
[01:09:58.193 --> 01:10:03.915]  Everything they do is rotting and falling apart in front of everyone.
[01:10:06.246 --> 01:10:12.948]  The only way we can be beaten is by letting the mainline Republican Party hijack things.
[01:10:12.948 --> 01:10:21.151]  We need them to get control of the House, but then immediately put heat on them when they continue the entire agenda.
[01:10:21.151 --> 01:10:22.911]  It took seven years to wake up to Bush.
[01:10:22.911 --> 01:10:24.832]  It took one year to wake up to Obama.
[01:10:24.832 --> 01:10:28.893]  It needs to take two weeks to wake up to the Republicans.
[01:10:28.893 --> 01:10:30.493]  The time is running out.
[01:10:30.493 --> 01:10:32.134]  The scams don't work anymore.
[01:10:33.086 --> 01:10:43.454]  We need to run real libertarian constitutionalists like Ron Paul, like Deborah Medina, like other people we see for every political office we can.
[01:10:43.454 --> 01:10:44.575]  We are popular.
[01:10:44.575 --> 01:10:46.476]  Our message is constitutional.
[01:10:46.476 --> 01:10:52.741]  We need to take over the Republican and Democratic parties.
[01:10:52.741 --> 01:10:54.242]  So what is the Supreme Court rule?
[01:11:02.083 --> 01:11:11.026]  The Supreme Court rules today that corporations can give all the money they want, but private citizens can't.
[01:11:11.026 --> 01:11:11.886]  See, they're panicking.
[01:11:11.886 --> 01:11:18.269]  They're saying, okay, we'll tie the citizens' hand to give money, and we'll turn the big banks that robbed everybody loose.
[01:11:18.269 --> 01:11:21.890]  We'll dump billions and billions into establishment candidates.
[01:11:21.890 --> 01:11:24.171]  We'll put in more electronic voting machines.
[01:11:24.171 --> 01:11:29.432]  We'll engage in more election fraud.
[01:11:29.432 --> 01:11:31.073]  They're not going to give up power easily.
[01:11:32.025 --> 01:11:34.407]  They're not gonna back off easily.
[01:11:34.407 --> 01:11:36.628]  They're not gonna go away easily.
[01:11:36.628 --> 01:11:38.269]  Mike in Louisiana, you're on the air.
[01:11:38.269 --> 01:11:43.913]  Okay, is Mike not there, guys?
[01:11:43.913 --> 01:11:49.517]  Yeah, I just want to team.
[01:11:49.517 --> 01:11:50.898]  Let's go to Mike in Louisiana.
[01:11:50.898 --> 01:11:52.359]  Mike, you're on the air.
[01:11:52.359 --> 01:11:54.141]  Hello, Alex, can you hear me?
[01:11:54.141 --> 01:11:55.301]  Yes, go ahead.
[01:11:55.301 --> 01:11:57.083]  Yeah, Alex, good to talk to you again.
[01:11:57.083 --> 01:12:01.246]  I'm the guy that called up Chertoff when he was on C-SPAN.
[01:12:01.246 --> 01:12:01.766]  Oh, one of them.
[01:12:02.844 --> 01:12:06.372]  We're going to call you and give you an update on what's going on here in New Orleans.
[01:12:06.372 --> 01:12:08.617]  Let me interrupt you again because you just brought that up.
[01:12:09.480 --> 01:12:17.428]  It's an hour long interview, and almost every single call, over 90%, brought up 9-11 being an inside job.
[01:12:17.428 --> 01:12:21.252]  9-11 Truth is the majority in many major polls.
[01:12:21.252 --> 01:12:26.216]  That's why they say we're the number one enemy, because they can't stage terror attacks anymore, and I salute you, sir.
[01:12:26.216 --> 01:12:27.117]  Go ahead.
[01:12:27.117 --> 01:12:27.958]  Thank you, sir.
[01:12:27.958 --> 01:12:29.279]  I salute you back.
[01:12:29.279 --> 01:12:31.121]  You are an inspiration.
[01:12:31.121 --> 01:12:33.864]  And I don't know if you know how funny you are.
[01:12:34.540 --> 01:12:37.862]  Sometimes when you go on your analogies, you crack me up.
[01:12:37.862 --> 01:12:43.746]  You gave... Well, you know, I write for the New Orleans Levy newspaper.
[01:12:43.746 --> 01:12:47.748]  We don't hold anything back, is our motto.
[01:12:47.748 --> 01:12:54.673]  I have been running a comic strip called Conspiracy Nut for the past three months.
[01:12:54.673 --> 01:12:58.035]  And it's been allowing me to... You've given me a lot of inspiration.
[01:12:58.035 --> 01:13:01.637]  Matter of fact, I think my next comic strip's going to be on Beck.
[01:13:03.287 --> 01:13:10.515]  Off of what the rant you went on yesterday about aliens landing and eating purple, I don't know, you went on some hilarious rant.
[01:13:10.515 --> 01:13:21.447]  Him saying that 9-11 truth is in the White House and is going to kill Obama is the equivalent of saying Marvin the Martian is going to land with a can opener and open our children's brains and eat their brains.
[01:13:21.447 --> 01:13:23.289]  I mean, it's as ridiculous.
[01:13:24.258 --> 01:13:25.039]  You're devastating them.
[01:13:46.938 --> 01:13:54.545]  Uh, early, uh, Ace Trucking Company, the committee's, uh, back that started the free speech movement, uh, long, long ago.
[01:13:54.545 --> 01:14:04.413]  Uh, and one of the tactics we used is one of the things I'm also starting up here now is a guerrilla street theater group.
[01:14:04.413 --> 01:14:10.298]  And we're going to be putting together skits that will be performed on the street that will
[01:14:11.311 --> 01:14:11.711]  Good to go.
[01:14:29.043 --> 01:14:30.765]  Uh, passing out DVDs.
[01:14:30.765 --> 01:14:33.367]  I mean, just getting out there and saying, here, here, here.
[01:14:33.367 --> 01:14:41.053]  When you can gather a crowd... A lot of people, a lot of people are doing street theater now all over the world where they get a bullhorn and say, I love the government!
[01:14:41.053 --> 01:14:42.755]  I love the naked body scanners!
[01:14:42.755 --> 01:14:47.238]  I think it's great that the banks have taken 28 trillion and are keeping it for themselves.
[01:14:47.238 --> 01:14:50.321]  I think it's wonderful children are being trained to inform on their parents.
[01:14:50.321 --> 01:14:51.982]  That's the American way!
[01:14:51.982 --> 01:14:54.604]  And this guy made this video that says it's wrong!
[01:14:54.604 --> 01:14:55.485]  He's a kook!
[01:14:55.485 --> 01:14:56.506]  He's scum!
[01:14:56.506 --> 01:14:57.567]  It's a funny video!
[01:14:57.887 --> 01:14:59.908]  Look at this conspiracy nut!
[01:14:59.908 --> 01:15:02.508]  And you give him that, boy, that's really effective.
[01:15:02.508 --> 01:15:03.209]  Yes, it was.
[01:15:03.209 --> 01:15:10.611]  Now, one other thing, when I first started this trip, it was about two months ago, I know you receive a lot of things, but I also know you illustrate.
[01:15:10.611 --> 01:15:14.532]  You said you were an illustrator, and you inspired me.
[01:15:14.532 --> 01:15:16.173]  Then, matter of fact, you brought it up again.
[01:15:16.173 --> 01:15:26.876]  You said that you brought up this image of Obama and Bernanke and all of them on top of a bunch of dead bodies raising a flag.
[01:15:27.856 --> 01:15:40.608]  So I went ahead and did that illustration and sent it to you along with, and I've been collecting, um, uh, music, uh, protest music for, for 50 years.
[01:15:40.608 --> 01:15:50.878]  And I sent you a DVD or a CD with some of the better stuff, more obscure stuff that I have, along with the illustration and the first copy of the Conspiracy Nut.
[01:15:51.630 --> 01:15:55.412]  I sent that to you about two months ago, registered mail, but I haven't received anything back.
[01:15:55.412 --> 01:15:59.234]  If you could have your guys check that out and see if you got that, it would be appreciated.
[01:15:59.234 --> 01:16:04.476]  Well, here's the problem, Mike, and I don't want to discourage people to send us stuff because we look at almost all of it.
[01:16:04.476 --> 01:16:10.179]  Piles, bags come in a week, sir, and we don't even have the staff or the money for more people.
[01:16:12.020 --> 01:16:16.063]  We end up looking at a lot of it, but then don't even have time to respond or do anything with it.
[01:16:16.063 --> 01:16:25.491]  It's also good to scan stuff and email it to Aaron at InfoWars.com and other addresses so that the guys can then post it on InfoWars.com.
[01:16:25.491 --> 01:16:27.132]  But I appreciate your call, Mike.
[01:16:27.132 --> 01:16:28.373]  Keep it up.
[01:16:28.373 --> 01:16:33.377]  I mean, if you want us to post an online version of the conspiracy nuts, send it to us.
[01:16:33.377 --> 01:16:36.159]  Let's go ahead and take a call from Dean.
[01:16:36.159 --> 01:16:36.800]  Dean was there.
[01:16:36.800 --> 01:16:37.260]  I skipped him.
[01:16:37.260 --> 01:16:37.861]  Sorry.
[01:16:37.861 --> 01:16:38.661]  Dean, you're on the air.
[01:16:38.661 --> 01:16:39.002]  Go ahead.
[01:16:39.890 --> 01:16:40.811]  Yes, sir.
[01:16:40.811 --> 01:16:45.574]  Thanks for everything you're doing, Alex, and thanks for keeping us informed.
[01:16:45.574 --> 01:16:55.600]  Like the gentleman said in the previous call, you're very motivational, and I'd like to refer to you as the Vince Lombardi of the truth movement.
[01:16:55.600 --> 01:16:56.781]  Well, that's a big compliment.
[01:16:56.781 --> 01:16:57.521]  Thank you.
[01:16:57.521 --> 01:17:00.563]  Yeah, well, I have a Vince Lombardi quote as well.
[01:17:00.563 --> 01:17:08.028]  People who work together will win, whether it be against complex football defenses or the problems of a modern society.
[01:17:08.846 --> 01:17:12.008]  And it's true, you really keep my head in the game.
[01:17:12.008 --> 01:17:15.250]  Keep us informed, and like I said, I really appreciate that.
[01:17:15.250 --> 01:17:16.671]  Well, I appreciate you, my friend.
[01:17:16.671 --> 01:17:17.952]  Anything else?
[01:17:17.952 --> 01:17:18.372]  Oh, yeah.
[01:17:18.372 --> 01:17:22.555]  Well, my topic, you're spot on with Glenn Beck, by the way.
[01:17:22.555 --> 01:17:25.197]  He is a complete traitor.
[01:17:25.197 --> 01:17:30.900]  And I'm a little off subject here, but my point was about the healthcare.
[01:17:30.900 --> 01:17:34.763]  And I was reading an article that said the Amish are going to be exempt
[01:17:35.427 --> 01:17:37.228]  From the healthcare mandate.
[01:17:37.228 --> 01:17:37.708]  That's right.
[01:17:37.708 --> 01:17:43.890]  They're exempt because they know it's a community of around a half million people in the U.S.
[01:17:43.890 --> 01:17:48.472]  that will not do it, and they've tried to CPS their kids, they've tried to break them up.
[01:17:48.472 --> 01:17:50.092]  They just can't force them into it.
[01:17:50.092 --> 01:17:59.315]  The Amish have no instances of autism, lower cancer rates, everything, because they're not living in our evil system.
[01:17:59.315 --> 01:18:00.776]  I absolutely agree.
[01:18:00.776 --> 01:18:03.577]  I live near Amish people here in western New York.
[01:18:04.404 --> 01:18:18.776]  And I guess my point mostly was that this kind of opened a loophole in the case that the globalists do get this health care mandate rammed down our throats here, is that it opens up the objection on a religious basis.
[01:18:18.776 --> 01:18:19.896]  Well it does.
[01:18:19.896 --> 01:18:23.880]  Listen, I have a plan that I've never openly announced on air.
[01:18:23.880 --> 01:18:31.245]  I don't want like compounds they can call extremist facilities, people can do whatever they want, but to have like high-tech Amish
[01:18:31.966 --> 01:18:52.057]  Where groups of people, but you've got to have strict rules or it falls apart, move to the country, but then have shifts where they go to high-tech facilities to fight for their rights and freedoms and fight the new world order, but then live in an agrarian society, but keep it completely compartmentalized where they then rotate
[01:18:52.677 --> 01:19:00.161]  into basically like the gun ports and the info war to go in and be involved in city government and locally to protect themselves.
[01:19:00.161 --> 01:19:05.004]  Because look, I'll guarantee you, the Amish and the Mennonites are not going to be able to continue their way of life for long.
[01:19:05.004 --> 01:19:06.704]  The enemy is coming for them.
[01:19:06.704 --> 01:19:11.607]  And anyone, the name of the game with the globalists is they want you dependent on them.
[01:19:11.607 --> 01:19:13.728]  We have to get back to the land and
[01:19:16.007 --> 01:19:17.287]  Be self-sufficient.
[01:19:17.287 --> 01:19:26.030]  But at the same time, we've got to wear two hats and be able to, in a limited fashion, interface with technology to take on the New World Order.
[01:19:26.030 --> 01:19:28.871]  You must do this or the Matrix will absorb them.
[01:19:28.871 --> 01:19:38.093]  The Matrix isn't too worried about them right now because they're not interfacing in government, so they're not threatening the takeover that's going on around them.
[01:19:38.093 --> 01:19:43.215]  But as the Amish and others get persecuted more, they're beginning to realize they're going to have to stand up for themselves.
[01:19:44.352 --> 01:19:45.833]  Anything else, sir?
[01:19:45.833 --> 01:19:47.654]  Well, just a point on the Amish.
[01:19:47.654 --> 01:20:00.603]  I don't know if this is... I'm trying to research this, and from what I understand is the land that the Amish have was given as an ecclesiastical trust, and basically as long as they remain passive, that's
[01:20:01.638 --> 01:20:06.240]  We all know that the Berkey water purification systems are the most trusted name in water filtration.
[01:20:06.240 --> 01:20:14.023]  As an authorized Berkey dealer for over four years and serving thousands of satisfied customers, the Berkey Guy offers amazing specials for Berkey water systems.

[01:21:01.278 --> 01:21:06.606]  One major world crisis away from having a totalitarian type of system.
[01:21:06.606 --> 01:21:09.370]  The main event is the wholesale destruction of the world economy.
[01:21:09.370 --> 01:21:13.856]  The push for every nation on the globe to identify and number all of its citizens.
[01:21:14.727 --> 01:21:19.230]  Friends, I hope that you will order Shadow Government from InfoWars.com.
[01:21:19.230 --> 01:21:20.330]  We also have some specials.
[01:21:20.330 --> 01:21:24.253]  You can get some of our other films half price when you order Shadow Government.
[01:21:24.253 --> 01:21:27.355]  A new level in production quality and in information.
[01:21:27.355 --> 01:21:35.480]  It exposes how a cashless society, surveillance beast grid of total control is being put into place.
[01:21:35.480 --> 01:21:37.081]  This film needs to be seen.

[01:21:49.176 --> 01:21:50.196]  Shadow Government.

[01:22:00.914 --> 01:22:10.943]  Originally, we the people have entrusted government to be the guardians of currency, to ensure purity, content, weights and measures of gold and silver coins citizens would use for commerce.
[01:22:10.943 --> 01:22:15.427]  This reinstalled confidence after the demise of the fiat continental system.
[01:22:15.427 --> 01:22:26.237]  Wisdom being lost with time, the government we once entrusted to protect from counterfeit has colluded with private business, creating the largest fiat counterfeiting scheme our country ever experienced.
[01:22:26.597 --> 01:22:35.780]  This is not only a transfer of power to an institution that is not accountable to our elected government, but has also caused the dollar to lose more than 90 cents of its original value.
[01:22:35.780 --> 01:22:40.802]  Now foreign governments are trying to divest themselves from this once world reserve currency.
[01:22:40.802 --> 01:22:42.182]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[01:22:42.182 --> 01:22:44.683]  I'm offering a book that explains how the system works.

[01:23:02.613 --> 01:23:05.856]  How would you feel with a normal cholesterol reading without the drugs?
[01:23:05.856 --> 01:23:07.738]  What if you could avoid bypass surgery?
[01:23:07.738 --> 01:23:10.280]  Would it not be nice to have your heartbeat regularly again?
[01:23:10.280 --> 01:23:11.802]  To have a sex life again?

[01:24:12.372 --> 01:24:39.295]  I wish a buck was still silver It was back when the country was strong Back before Elvis And before the Vietnam War came along Before the Beatles and yesterday
[01:24:46.556 --> 01:24:52.981]  Look, on the subject of the Amish, they came over from Germany and Switzerland more than 200 years ago.
[01:24:52.981 --> 01:24:55.183]  They were set up in the 1600s.
[01:24:55.183 --> 01:25:01.728]  And they have been grandfathered into their land as sovereign landholders.
[01:25:01.728 --> 01:25:03.129]  There's a bunch of different subgroups.
[01:25:03.129 --> 01:25:05.851]  There's the old Amish, the new Amish, the Mennonites.
[01:25:06.937 --> 01:25:08.738]  There's a bunch of different groups.
[01:25:08.738 --> 01:25:26.725]  What the Amish need to test is having a group in their council break off and buy small facilities in town and elect representatives who outside of their communities has to be separate
[01:25:27.936 --> 01:25:38.919]  Rotate through into a high-technology facility to run their own websites, to fight for their rights, to fight for their freedoms, and to be politically involved in the community.
[01:25:38.919 --> 01:25:51.103]  But have it compartmentalized, even if they have to have groups that volunteer to split off and to be the defense system
[01:25:52.230 --> 01:25:53.991]  For their rural communities.
[01:25:53.991 --> 01:26:01.998]  But other modern people, groups who've never been part of the Amish or Mennonites, they could do this as well.
[01:26:01.998 --> 01:26:05.160]  We see that happening in New Hampshire with this Free State Project.
[01:26:05.160 --> 01:26:07.022]  Tens of thousands of people have moved there.
[01:26:07.022 --> 01:26:08.683]  They're really changing things.
[01:26:08.683 --> 01:26:15.849]  They're creating these loosely knit communities that are high technology, interfaced with the system to fight it.
[01:26:17.230 --> 01:26:25.054]  Because there's no doubt that the establishment is beginning to target the Amish and Mennonites and others and try to set them up and bring them down.
[01:26:25.054 --> 01:26:28.135]  But again, that's for them to decide.
[01:26:28.135 --> 01:26:30.016]  It's just that things have changed.
[01:26:30.016 --> 01:26:31.537]  We are in the 21st century.
[01:26:31.537 --> 01:26:35.379]  And the New World Order is not going to allow these groups to continue operating the way they have been.
[01:26:35.379 --> 01:26:39.221]  Coming up, Supreme Court removes limits on corporate labor donations to campaigns.
[01:26:39.221 --> 01:26:40.342]  We'll cover that right now.
[01:26:40.342 --> 01:26:41.902]  Let's go to Jeff in Indiana.
[01:26:41.902 --> 01:26:42.623]  Jeff, you're on the air.
[01:26:43.430 --> 01:26:45.852]  Mr. Jones, absolute pleasure to be talking to you.
[01:26:45.852 --> 01:26:49.356]  I mean, it is truly an honor.
[01:26:49.356 --> 01:26:54.000]  Since I've been listening to your show, I'm a loyal podcast listener.
[01:26:54.000 --> 01:26:56.343]  Everyone tells me how much healthier I look.
[01:26:56.343 --> 01:26:59.486]  I'm telling how much healthier I feel.
[01:26:59.486 --> 01:27:06.172]  I recommend your show to everybody, but that small joke aside, I have two activist ideas.
[01:27:06.172 --> 01:27:06.913]  One of them is
[01:27:07.974 --> 01:27:15.261]  Um, where I live, I won't name any businesses, but there are boxes of vending machines that happen to be red.
[01:27:15.261 --> 01:27:18.644]  And they distribute DVDs.
[01:27:18.644 --> 01:27:21.327]  And what I do is I take a copy of
[01:27:22.170 --> 01:27:47.143]  You know, especially your newest films, you know, are especially wonderful for this, but you take the DVD, you put a piece, a note in it, and it says, watch this DVD, if at the very least put this DVD back where you found it for the next person to watch it, if you feel like I do, you will take this DVD and you will make a copy of it and give it to your friends, your family,
[01:27:47.844 --> 01:27:50.787]  Um, and then also put one back on the box.
[01:27:50.787 --> 01:27:57.314]  Um, I made an email address so that the person can contact me if they need to find out different ways to do things.
[01:27:57.314 --> 01:28:06.484]  But it's a method that I think would easily, you can find people who are already looking for a movie to watch and you can spring their mind open.
[01:28:07.462 --> 01:28:11.504]  I hope that other activists out there will take this idea and run with it.
[01:28:11.504 --> 01:28:27.873]  My other idea, or the other thing I do is, sir, I have taken to gardening, and it is an absolute, I mean, to get back to the creative, it is the most creative I've felt since having a child, in the sense of
[01:28:28.959 --> 01:28:31.842]  Being at one with our Creator.
[01:28:31.842 --> 01:28:36.126]  Humans are meant to be out in the sun, outside, working in the dirt.
[01:28:36.126 --> 01:28:39.108]  Again, we're losing our humanity in little steps.
[01:28:40.066 --> 01:29:00.243]  Turn into big steps, turn into long marches against tyranny, and it's simple things like drinking purified water, eating healthier food, getting out on the sun, spending more time with our families, turning the television sets off for at least part of the day, and you will start to extricate yourself from the Matrix-like system.
[01:29:01.826 --> 01:29:02.846]  Yes, sir.
[01:29:02.846 --> 01:29:03.267]  Absolutely.
[01:29:03.267 --> 01:29:13.971]  I mean, to pull a carrot out of the ground, wash it off, and hand it to my three-year-old, there is no better feeling in the world knowing that you're giving him what God has created.
[01:29:13.971 --> 01:29:19.213]  And I hope I was clear as far as my activist idea.
[01:29:20.481 --> 01:29:24.442]  No, I mean, you said red boxes at certain businesses.
[01:29:24.442 --> 01:29:29.944]  I mean, I tell people to make copies of my films and give them to people and tell them to make copies.
[01:29:29.944 --> 01:29:33.566]  I don't know what the red boxes are, no.
[01:29:33.566 --> 01:29:41.348]  Oh, well, it's basically, they're DVD vending machines that they have throughout the nation, especially where I live.
[01:29:41.348 --> 01:29:43.469]  And I know that they're in New York, Chicago,
[01:29:44.585 --> 01:29:51.749]  All your major metropolitans, they are in most, uh... And you put them in the BIM where they drop down.
[01:29:51.749 --> 01:29:53.130]  We're on the march.
[01:29:53.130 --> 01:29:55.671]  The empire's on the run.
[01:29:55.671 --> 01:29:58.333]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:30:01.949 --> 01:30:05.972]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[01:30:05.972 --> 01:30:09.214]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[01:30:09.214 --> 01:30:14.018]  As they're finishing off this agenda, they'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[01:30:14.018 --> 01:30:20.402]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[01:30:20.402 --> 01:30:22.644]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us
[01:30:23.184 --> 01:30:23.485]  Tim Geithner?
[01:30:23.485 --> 01:30:24.005]  Bernanke?
[01:30:24.005 --> 01:30:24.786]  They're arsonists!
[01:30:24.786 --> 01:30:25.947]  They're asking for more matches!
[01:30:25.947 --> 01:30:28.190]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[01:30:42.085 --> 01:30:49.355]  Today seems like nobody does care and right now in Washington DC we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[01:30:49.355 --> 01:30:58.487]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv
[01:31:00.663 --> 01:31:06.010]  One major world crisis away from having a totalitarian type of system.
[01:31:06.010 --> 01:31:08.754]  The main event is the wholesale destruction of the world economy.
[01:31:08.754 --> 01:31:13.220]  The push for every nation on the globe to identify and number all of its citizens.
[01:31:15.503 --> 01:31:18.566]  Order Shadow Government from Infowars.com.
[01:31:18.566 --> 01:31:23.570]  We also have some specials when you get some of our other films half price when you order Shadow Government.
[01:31:23.570 --> 01:31:26.673]  A new level in production quality and in information.
[01:31:26.673 --> 01:31:34.740]  It exposes how a cashless society, surveillance beast grid of total control is being put into place.
[01:31:34.740 --> 01:31:36.581]  This film needs to be seen.
[01:31:36.581 --> 01:31:37.742]  Everybody needs to get it.
[01:31:37.742 --> 01:31:38.923]  So order yours today.

[01:31:48.525 --> 01:31:49.926]  Shadow Government.

[01:32:01.192 --> 01:32:04.194]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[01:32:04.194 --> 01:32:09.539]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[01:32:09.539 --> 01:32:11.580]  My answer would be all I can get.
[01:32:11.580 --> 01:32:16.584]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[01:32:16.584 --> 01:32:17.505]  How much do you want?
[01:32:17.745 --> 01:32:18.886]  When do you want it?
[01:32:18.886 --> 01:32:20.767]  Now or after the battle starts?
[01:32:20.767 --> 01:32:21.848]  When will you need it?
[01:32:21.848 --> 01:32:24.049]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[01:32:24.049 --> 01:32:25.390]  Will there be any food?
[01:32:25.390 --> 01:32:26.911]  Will it make your children sick?
[01:32:26.911 --> 01:32:32.175]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[01:32:32.175 --> 01:32:35.757]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[01:32:35.757 --> 01:32:39.240]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[01:32:39.580 --> 01:32:40.801]  How much will you need?
[01:32:40.801 --> 01:32:41.702]  We don't know.
[01:32:41.702 --> 01:32:42.823]  How much do you want?
[01:32:42.823 --> 01:32:43.744]  All you can get.
[01:32:43.744 --> 01:32:44.845]  I'm Alex Jones.
[01:32:44.845 --> 01:32:47.887]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.
[01:32:47.887 --> 01:32:49.669]  Call 1-800-409-5633 or check it out on the web at efoodsdirect.com.
[01:32:49.669 --> 01:32:50.589]  Again, that number 1-800-409-5633.
[01:33:07.851 --> 01:33:18.257]  Alright, I said open phones today.
[01:33:18.257 --> 01:33:23.220]  And yes, I've got Hugo Chavez saying the earthquake was a tectonic weapon.
[01:33:23.220 --> 01:33:25.322]  That is a ridiculous conspiracy theory.
[01:33:27.884 --> 01:33:32.667]  It's ridiculous for him to say it was a tectonic attack.
[01:33:32.667 --> 01:33:40.233]  He should have said, could it be a tectonic attack, and quote the Pentagon admitting they have these weapons, he should have called for an investigation.
[01:33:40.233 --> 01:33:52.121]  But he discredits himself, because I have the text of what he said from a Venezuelan government approved newspaper, the media is controlled there, with him saying it was an attack, and then not giving evidence.
[01:33:54.744 --> 01:33:55.964]  So we're gonna be covering that.
[01:33:55.964 --> 01:33:59.466]  I'm gonna get into the attacks on free speech in the country.
[01:33:59.466 --> 01:34:09.989]  Supreme Court removes list on limits of corporate labor donations to campaigns.
[01:34:09.989 --> 01:34:21.453]  So it's saying groups, groups and corporations can give money, but the restrictions on individual giving, it's still there.
[01:34:21.453 --> 01:34:23.534]  The way I read this ruling.
[01:34:25.660 --> 01:34:37.126]  That's just like campaign finance reform of 2002 that Bush signed on to, breaking his promise not to sign it, remember?
[01:34:37.126 --> 01:34:45.511]  The McCain-Feingold legislation said that corporations could double the money they gave, but individuals could give less.
[01:34:45.511 --> 01:34:46.551]  So great!
[01:34:46.551 --> 01:34:51.454]  Labor unions and big corporations can give more money, but the citizens can't, the way I read this.
[01:34:51.454 --> 01:34:52.715]  Call in and correct me if I'm wrong.
[01:34:54.110 --> 01:34:58.933]  And believe me, we get stuff wrong, especially when it's brand new and we're trying to analyze it.
[01:34:58.933 --> 01:35:08.899]  Kind of like they said they were gonna have the hearings today, but now they've postponed them to next week with Geithner and Paulson, but then the news is still reporting that some type of banking hearing's going on.
[01:35:08.899 --> 01:35:10.519]  So, we're trying to keep track of that.
[01:35:10.519 --> 01:35:15.122]  I mean, there is so much going on in the world.
[01:35:15.122 --> 01:35:18.264]  Ladies and gentlemen, I am a documentary filmmaker.
[01:35:18.264 --> 01:35:20.885]  I have made, I don't know, what is it, 24 films?
[01:35:23.402 --> 01:35:26.244]  And the last couple, I mean, they just get better and better.
[01:35:26.244 --> 01:35:39.796]  Fall of the Republic, the production quality, the information, shattering the left-right paradigm, exposing the environmental takeover that has nothing to do with the environment, the police state takeover, how they're brainwashing the Boy Scouts to serve homeland security.
[01:35:39.796 --> 01:35:40.817]  It's all covered.
[01:35:41.727 --> 01:35:44.228]  In the Obama Deception, Fall of the Republic.

[01:35:47.948 --> 01:35:52.869]  We're also carrying the new film that I didn't produce, but I'm shocked by its quality.

[01:37:11.360 --> 01:37:25.716]  Now I want to try to now take calls until the bottom of the next hour and then I am going to reconvene all my stacks of news because it all gets mixed up in big piles here in front of me and try to systematically go through it all because it's so important and there's so much of it.
[01:37:27.808 --> 01:37:29.449]  So much good news.
[01:37:29.449 --> 01:37:37.895]  I mean, I'm buoyed and excited, but at the same time, I know the globalists are using their tricks again, and so I want to expose that.
[01:37:37.895 --> 01:37:39.576]  But so much good news happening.
[01:37:39.576 --> 01:37:48.503]  I mean, the White House TSA czar, who said Christians are the number one threat to homeland security and the main terror threat, he's now withdrawn his nomination.
[01:37:49.755 --> 01:37:52.476]  They're in full retreat, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:37:52.476 --> 01:37:58.279]  The problem is if we take the bait and switch and let establishment Republicans take over again, we're gonna be cooked.
[01:37:58.279 --> 01:37:59.900]  We'll be back in the same position.
[01:37:59.900 --> 01:38:07.423]  Then people will put Democrats back in to fix it and it'll get even worse!
[01:38:07.423 --> 01:38:11.005]  And I believe Obama is at the greatest threat point right now.
[01:38:13.260 --> 01:38:22.459]  At the greatest danger level right now of staging a terror attack, or starting a new war, or releasing a bioweapon, so the government can respond as the savior.
[01:38:25.913 --> 01:38:30.234]  We have the Rand Corporation saying the government needs to stage events.
[01:38:30.234 --> 01:38:32.595]  We have all the CFR white papers.
[01:38:32.595 --> 01:38:36.556]  Ladies and gentlemen, now is the danger zone.
[01:38:36.556 --> 01:38:39.978]  We have got to start warning people to look for stage terror.
[01:38:39.978 --> 01:38:42.018]  That's coming up later in the next hour.
[01:38:42.018 --> 01:38:47.320]  Now, I get these calls all the time and that's fine, but people say, I don't want to say my name.
[01:38:47.320 --> 01:38:49.701]  Make up a name then.
[01:38:49.701 --> 01:38:52.442]  I don't care.
[01:38:52.442 --> 01:38:53.682]  Say your name as man.
[01:38:55.205 --> 01:38:56.906]  Hi Alex, I'm actually calling from Michigan.
[01:39:22.231 --> 01:39:30.313]  I'm a little bit nervous here, but this Amish thing keeps coming up and listening.
[01:39:30.313 --> 01:39:32.574]  I know that there's a lot of myths out there.
[01:39:32.574 --> 01:39:39.976]  There's one thing I would like to clarify as far as the land thing.
[01:39:39.976 --> 01:39:41.776]  We're just like everybody else.
[01:39:41.776 --> 01:39:44.897]  We pay our land taxes.
[01:39:44.897 --> 01:39:48.638]  We have the DEQ, the DNR, all those.
[01:39:50.487 --> 01:40:00.293]  Outside government agents, you know, unelected people, you know, breathing down our throat, too.
[01:40:00.293 --> 01:40:04.195]  We're not exempt from those things.
[01:40:04.195 --> 01:40:07.917]  You know, there are some things that help us as a community and as a people.
[01:40:07.917 --> 01:40:10.458]  We have a voice.
[01:40:10.458 --> 01:40:15.681]  We do have a steering committee that represents the Amish in general.
[01:40:15.681 --> 01:40:18.503]  They go to Washington back.
[01:40:19.048 --> 01:40:33.895]  We're one of the pioneers of the homeschooling movement that actually started out as being a parochial school where our fathers actually went to prison because we didn't no longer want to send our children to the
[01:40:35.467 --> 01:40:48.137]  You know, maybe I should do an interview sometime with you, and I should add that we actually know who you are, and that you just called in to one of the backlines, so we're not saying your name, but you really are Amish.
[01:40:48.137 --> 01:40:50.399]  So we can confirm.
[01:40:50.399 --> 01:40:55.584]  But I've done my own research, and absolutely, the Amish are under massive, sustained attack
[01:40:56.204 --> 01:41:10.354]  And so even some of the old Amish, as the groups are known, are having to have some of the elders, you know, the big daddy, as a lot of locals call them, you know, have to get cars now, have to interface, have to deal with this.
[01:41:10.354 --> 01:41:12.976]  They are coming after your kids with a CPS.
[01:41:12.976 --> 01:41:14.097]  They are harassing you.
[01:41:14.097 --> 01:41:16.499]  They are trying to destroy you right now.
[01:41:16.499 --> 01:41:20.362]  And that's my point is, is the Amish need to get even more proactive.
[01:41:20.362 --> 01:41:23.504]  But I wasn't aware of how active you guys are.
[01:41:23.504 --> 01:41:24.825]  I mean, in the Amish community,
[01:41:25.465 --> 01:41:28.408]  I know I've talked to some that are very aware of what's happening.
[01:41:28.408 --> 01:41:32.251]  Do you guys know about the New World Order and what's going on?
[01:41:32.251 --> 01:41:34.113]  I would say yes and no.
[01:41:34.113 --> 01:41:38.917]  It really depends on which part of the community that you're talking about.
[01:41:38.917 --> 01:41:42.000]  We're a fairly diversified people at this point.
[01:41:42.000 --> 01:41:48.066]  We do have a strong belief of work ethics and being separated from the world.
[01:41:48.066 --> 01:41:51.629]  It's called non-conformity to the world and I think there's a protection in that.
[01:41:52.433 --> 01:42:03.766]  I don't want to use up a lot of time, but this is one of the biblical mottos, for example, that a lot of our people will go by and quote.
[01:42:03.766 --> 01:42:05.068]  This is from 1 Timothy 2.
[01:42:10.675 --> 01:42:16.319]  I exhort, therefore, that first of all supplications, prayers, and intercessions, and giving of thanks be made for all men.
[01:42:16.319 --> 01:42:26.067]  And then it says, for kings and for officers, in authority, that we may lead a quiet and peaceable life in all godliness and honesty.
[01:42:26.067 --> 01:42:31.852]  So that is why we are here in the United States to begin with, so that we can do that.
[01:42:31.852 --> 01:42:34.374]  And so we don't, we're not
[01:42:34.915 --> 01:42:40.357]  Super proactive as far as in politics goes, because we try to stay separated from that.
[01:42:40.357 --> 01:42:44.298]  But this is all that we ask the government to do for us.
[01:42:44.298 --> 01:42:47.560]  Let us lead a quiet and peaceable life.
[01:42:47.560 --> 01:42:52.501]  And I believe that there's a lot of other people out there that want to have that same wish.
[01:42:52.501 --> 01:42:54.922]  They just want to live.
[01:42:54.922 --> 01:42:58.644]  And we do realize that the New World Order is a threat to that.
[01:42:58.644 --> 01:43:01.865]  And all these so-called security measures that are now in control.
[01:43:02.489 --> 01:43:05.410]  So, you know, I want to thank you for what you do.
[01:43:05.410 --> 01:43:08.551]  Of course, I don't agree with everything, but that's fine.
[01:43:08.551 --> 01:43:13.272]  We all want to simply live, and I believe that's what you're trying to tell people.
[01:43:13.272 --> 01:43:17.594]  Adam, what's the Bible verse the Amish have about not going to churches?
[01:43:17.594 --> 01:43:21.235]  Because there's a lot of verses about don't worship in temples.
[01:43:21.235 --> 01:43:27.016]  That's actually very occultic, but again... That's actually not something that we get out of the Bible.
[01:43:27.016 --> 01:43:28.517]  That was due to persecution.
[01:43:29.817 --> 01:43:35.664]  No, no, actually I was reading a quote out of the encyclopedia.
[01:43:35.664 --> 01:43:42.471]  It is a Bible verse about, you know, don't worship in the temples.
[01:43:42.471 --> 01:43:50.119]  Okay, well, I guess I don't know about that, but what I do know is that when we were persecuted back in the Reformation time,
[01:43:52.316 --> 01:43:55.639]  It wasn't safe to meet in public, so we started meeting in homes.
[01:43:55.639 --> 01:43:57.701]  That kind of continued as a tradition.
[01:43:57.701 --> 01:44:01.103]  Now, a lot of our churches actually do have church houses now.
[01:44:01.103 --> 01:44:04.166]  So are you originally from Switzerland or Germany?
[01:44:04.166 --> 01:44:05.567]  I'm Switzerland, yes.
[01:44:05.567 --> 01:44:18.057]  And then, right, many of my forefathers would have given their lives to not bend to the government and their unscriptural and tyrannical demands.
[01:44:18.057 --> 01:44:21.200]  Just simply, you know, allow themselves to be beheaded and drowned.
[01:44:22.391 --> 01:44:28.112]  That's right, because the Amish got persecuted by the Catholic Church, didn't they?
[01:44:28.112 --> 01:44:29.352]  Yes.
[01:44:50.874 --> 01:44:52.715]  Yeah, people don't know that.
[01:44:52.715 --> 01:44:55.877]  There was also, there was a lot of Protestant persecution.
[01:44:55.877 --> 01:45:00.640]  I mean, I've read the histories of all the people they killed.
[01:45:00.640 --> 01:45:02.000]  Yeah.
[01:45:02.000 --> 01:45:04.562]  But that's, you know, that's neither here nor there.
[01:45:04.562 --> 01:45:09.625]  We, you know, the Bible tells us that if we get persecuted in one place, then just move to another.
[01:45:09.625 --> 01:45:14.968]  And I realize that's not your philosophy, and that's okay.
[01:45:14.968 --> 01:45:16.749]  I'm not here to tell you that that's not
[01:45:17.438 --> 01:45:31.743]  You know, for you to be like that, but we just tried to follow what we understand to be our moral compass, the creator of the universe, and he did leave his last will and testament for us here on this earth.
[01:45:31.743 --> 01:45:39.967]  We tried to follow that, and all we want, we don't want wealth, fame, political power.
[01:45:39.967 --> 01:45:43.588]  We simply want to live a quiet and peaceful life.
[01:45:44.713 --> 01:45:49.916]  And am I accurate in saying that the government is really starting to come in and harass you more?
[01:45:49.916 --> 01:45:55.559]  Well, it's like the, for instance, this new healthcare thing.
[01:45:55.559 --> 01:45:57.540]  For example, Social Security.
[01:45:57.540 --> 01:45:59.041]  We're exempt from Social Security.
[01:45:59.041 --> 01:46:03.804]  We don't pay in, but then we also do not draw Social Security.
[01:46:03.804 --> 01:46:05.505]  But we pay our taxes
[01:46:06.354 --> 01:46:12.215]  On our land, most of it goes to school, but we fund our own school with absolutely no government help.
[01:46:12.215 --> 01:46:15.316]  We don't get government help to fund our own school.
[01:46:15.316 --> 01:46:17.976]  And we don't have special privileges.
[01:46:17.976 --> 01:46:33.959]  We're hard-working people that simply don't, you know... I'm not trying to pat anybody on the back, but it comes down to a fact that if you lose your moral compass,
[01:46:35.118 --> 01:46:38.319]  And you don't have anything to guide you.
[01:46:38.319 --> 01:46:40.479]  Life becomes meaningless.
[01:46:40.479 --> 01:46:43.020]  And so that's what's happening with our society.
[01:46:43.020 --> 01:46:46.681]  And I've heard you talk many times about our society.
[01:46:46.681 --> 01:46:49.081]  The core issue here is our society.
[01:46:49.081 --> 01:46:56.063]  And I realize that there's a big mean, sinister agenda behind a lot of the powerful in the world.
[01:46:56.462 --> 01:47:00.864]  But the reason it's been able to happen is because people did become rudderless.
[01:47:00.864 --> 01:47:03.726]  They're empty, and so that can be filled with the world's evil.
[01:47:03.726 --> 01:47:05.267]  I appreciate your call.
[01:47:05.267 --> 01:47:05.987]  Good to hear from you.
[01:47:05.987 --> 01:47:08.468]  Alright, now I'm going to try to really accelerate through calls now.
[01:47:08.468 --> 01:47:11.710]  I just want to take a lot of calls, but I'd also like to have the callers have time to talk.
[01:47:11.710 --> 01:47:15.352]  We're going to go to Matt, Jessica, Curtis, Randy, Tessa, and others.
[01:47:15.352 --> 01:47:18.213]  Matt, in Minnesota, you're on the air.
[01:47:18.213 --> 01:47:19.754]  Hey Alex, thanks for taking my call.
[01:47:19.754 --> 01:47:21.095]  Welcome.
[01:47:21.095 --> 01:47:24.777]  Hey, I just, I think the Glenn Beck deception, that's a great idea.
[01:47:25.970 --> 01:47:42.497]  I mean, I would even do a little showcase on some of the other Fox News talking heads, like Andy Limbaugh and O'Reilly, who all seem to claim a false allegiance to the Constitution, where they talk about, we need torture, we need wiretaps, we need more war.
[01:47:42.497 --> 01:47:50.440]  They tell Obama to defy the Constitution on one hand, but then on the other hand, they get mad when he defies it for things like healthcare.
[01:47:52.008 --> 01:47:53.469]  And these guys are just total hypocrites.
[01:47:53.469 --> 01:48:06.855]  And they say, and they give him left cover, they say he's not attacking enough countries when he's brought forward the two biggest defense budgets in history, is letting the CIA take over the Pentagon, absolutely running wild, and they say, oh, he's a communist.
[01:48:06.855 --> 01:48:11.097]  No, he's not a communist, he's a globalist, banker, looter.
[01:48:11.097 --> 01:48:20.042]  Yeah, these guys, these guys all claim the false allegiance that they're these true patriots and that they're great Americans and that they're for the Constitution, but hey,
[01:48:21.354 --> 01:48:25.237]  They completely act and say things in the total contrary to that.
[01:48:25.237 --> 01:48:29.160]  You know, if they do as I say, none of them do.
[01:48:29.160 --> 01:48:46.513]  Unfortunately, I mean, many people in this nation, they just, they listen to that, and they sell out on their ethics, their morals, their allegiance to the Constitution, and even their values associated to their religious faith, in order to align themselves to these talking heads and these politicians.
[01:48:49.564 --> 01:48:54.112]  And they say we've got to give up our rights and torture people because Al-Qaeda will get us.
[01:48:54.112 --> 01:48:54.974]  I appreciate your call.
[01:48:54.974 --> 01:48:56.036]  Great points.
[01:48:56.036 --> 01:48:57.038]  Here is the quote.
[01:48:57.038 --> 01:48:57.659]  It's from Act 1724.
[01:48:57.659 --> 01:48:58.039]  We found it.
[01:49:02.242 --> 01:49:09.504]  It says, the majority of old order Amish congregations do not have church buildings but hold worship services in private homes.
[01:49:09.504 --> 01:49:13.285]  Thus they are sometimes called House Amish.
[01:49:13.285 --> 01:49:16.985]  This practice is based on a verse from the New Testament.
[01:49:16.985 --> 01:49:27.248]  The God who made the world and all things in it, since he is the Lord of heaven and earth, does not dwell in temples made with hands.
[01:49:27.248 --> 01:49:27.448]  Acts 17 24.
[01:49:31.238 --> 01:49:38.903]  And of course, Christ also said, look at the Pharisees and Sadducees up on the, you know, at the temple, praying in front of everybody, telling you how good they are.
[01:49:38.903 --> 01:49:41.905]  Go into your prayer closet privately.
[01:49:41.905 --> 01:49:43.106]  That's where you're gonna find God.
[01:49:43.106 --> 01:49:49.510]  So I find God at 3.30 in the morning in my living room with the lights off.
[01:49:49.510 --> 01:49:58.056]  Not up on the radio or at church in front of people all dressed up fancy, telling people what a great Christian I am and how good I am.
[01:49:59.485 --> 01:50:08.369]  Now I think church communities are good if you use them to fellowship and organize, to be politically involved and fight corruption.
[01:50:08.369 --> 01:50:14.612]  And to protect each other from the government and to protect each other with charity when people in your church need help.
[01:50:14.612 --> 01:50:18.313]  Giving them jobs, money, helping people.
[01:50:20.148 --> 01:50:25.631]  A lot of these churches are like shopping malls with helicopter pads and swimming pools and country clubs.
[01:50:25.631 --> 01:50:29.132]  And, you know, that's not where you're going to find God.
[01:50:29.132 --> 01:50:34.375]  I mean, I go in these big churches and I get a bad feeling, folks.
[01:50:34.375 --> 01:50:37.757]  I go to some church Bible study at a house.
[01:50:37.757 --> 01:50:38.357]  I feel good.
[01:50:38.357 --> 01:50:41.178]  I mean, let me tell you what I feel in big churches.
[01:50:41.178 --> 01:50:42.859]  Satan.
[01:50:42.859 --> 01:50:44.340]  It's like when I watch Glenn Beck.
[01:50:44.340 --> 01:50:48.162]  I mean, not just his actions, but his whole spirit.
[01:50:49.119 --> 01:50:51.023]  Everything in me says, Red Alert!
[01:50:51.023 --> 01:50:52.225]  Danger, Will Robinson!
[01:50:52.225 --> 01:50:52.746]  Danger!
[01:50:52.746 --> 01:50:53.708]  Danger!
[01:50:53.708 --> 01:50:55.051]  There's an enemy approaching!
[01:50:55.051 --> 01:50:55.852]  Just like with Obama!
[01:50:55.852 --> 01:50:58.878]  I mean, follow your guts, folks!
[01:50:58.878 --> 01:51:00.401]  Come on, just look at Glenn Beck!

[01:51:57.015 --> 01:52:02.717]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[01:52:02.717 --> 01:52:08.300]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[01:52:08.300 --> 01:52:13.322]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds could become more valuable than silver or gold?
[01:52:13.322 --> 01:52:18.904]  It's true, seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country, and it's possible they could even happen again.
[01:52:18.904 --> 01:52:23.586]  So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds.
[01:52:24.107 --> 01:52:31.230]  They call it a survival seed bank and it can produce an endless supply of nutrient dense food for you and your family.
[01:52:31.230 --> 01:52:32.331]  And here's the best part.
[01:52:32.331 --> 01:52:35.412]  These seeds have not been genetically modified in any way.
[01:52:35.412 --> 01:52:39.034]  And you actually get enough seeds to plant a full acre crisis garden.
[01:52:39.034 --> 01:52:42.215]  So visit them today at survivalseedbank.com.
[01:52:42.215 --> 01:52:45.316]  That's survivalseedbank.com or give them a call at 877-327-0365.
[01:52:45.316 --> 01:52:45.556]  That's 877-327-0365.
[01:52:45.556 --> 01:52:45.817]  Remember,
[01:52:54.161 --> 01:52:58.083]  In a real crisis, non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item.
[01:52:58.083 --> 01:53:01.965]  This is Alex Jones for SurvivalSeedBank.com.
[01:53:01.965 --> 01:53:08.669]  Why is drinking pure high alkaline pH water the most important factor in maintaining high energy and vibrant health?
[01:53:08.669 --> 01:53:15.072]  Because alkalizing water helps your body rid itself of acidic waste and increases the oxygen content of your body.
[01:53:15.072 --> 01:53:21.055]  Disease organisms like bacteria, viruses, and cancer cannot survive in an alkaline high pH environment.
[01:53:21.375 --> 01:53:26.778]  AlkaVision Plasma pH Drops combine a unique formula of the most alkaline minerals.
[01:53:26.778 --> 01:53:34.942]  Using AlkaVision pH Drops is the best way to make your water alkaline to help you get rid of acid and regain your health and energy.
[01:53:34.942 --> 01:53:39.044]  Simply put 10 drops in the water you drink to raise the pH to an alkaline level.
[01:53:39.544 --> 01:53:44.207]  Most experts agree that the water you drink should be at a pH level of 8 or higher.
[01:53:44.207 --> 01:53:49.950]  Order your bottle of AlkaVision Plasma pH Drops now by going directly to AlkaVision.com.

[01:54:08.260 --> 01:54:18.602]  Continuing with your calls, giant news blitzes, and the huge victories we're having coming up in the next hour, as well as world news, financial news, Jessica in Michigan.
[01:54:18.602 --> 01:54:19.382]  You're on the air.
[01:54:19.382 --> 01:54:25.383]  Hello?
[01:54:25.383 --> 01:54:26.223]  Yes, Jessica.
[01:54:26.223 --> 01:54:30.624]  Sorry for a while.
[01:54:30.624 --> 01:54:32.544]  I can give you five seconds, Jessica.
[01:54:32.544 --> 01:54:35.525]  Um, can I just say, I, um,
[01:54:36.744 --> 01:54:50.071]  I haven't felt this passionate about anything since the JFK conspiracy and I watched your movie last night.
[01:54:50.071 --> 01:54:50.671]  Wow.
[01:54:50.671 --> 01:54:52.092]  That's all I can say.
[01:54:52.092 --> 01:54:52.832]  What film was that?
[01:54:52.832 --> 01:55:02.176]  I have called everybody in my phone this morning and told them about a fall from the Republic.
[01:55:05.508 --> 01:55:14.712]  I'm just blown away that people are so either oblivious or they choose to be oblivious.
[01:55:14.712 --> 01:55:16.233]  They choose to be oblivious.
[01:55:16.233 --> 01:55:19.774]  To everything that's going on.
[01:55:19.774 --> 01:55:21.415]  And I was one of those people.
[01:55:21.415 --> 01:55:23.616]  I chose to be oblivious.
[01:55:23.616 --> 01:55:24.476]  I didn't want to know.
[01:55:24.476 --> 01:55:25.457]  I didn't watch the news.
[01:55:25.457 --> 01:55:26.457]  I didn't pay attention.
[01:55:26.457 --> 01:55:30.199]  I didn't want to know.
[01:55:35.029 --> 01:55:42.214]  Now I'm just, wow, kudos to Alex is all I have to say.
[01:55:42.214 --> 01:55:44.655]  Well, ma'am, please don't give me kudos.
[01:55:44.655 --> 01:55:45.856]  Do what you've done.
[01:55:45.856 --> 01:55:50.619]  Call everybody you know, make copies of the DVD, send them the free video link on YouTube.
[01:55:50.619 --> 01:55:53.281]  It's up there for free, not in the highest quality.
[01:55:53.281 --> 01:55:55.342]  Get a PrisonPlanet.tv membership.
[01:55:55.342 --> 01:55:57.424]  Share the Pasco with a few friends and family.
[01:55:58.144 --> 01:55:58.745]  Yeah, yeah.
[01:56:17.133 --> 01:56:18.334]  The bad news.
[01:56:18.334 --> 01:56:22.277]  Things are getting bad, so people will finally wake up and listen.
[01:56:22.277 --> 01:56:32.984]  They are ready to wake up, and even if they laugh when they watch it today, as they get squeezed tighter and tighter, Jessica, they're going to remember that the film showed them the entire paradigm.
[01:56:32.984 --> 01:56:43.351]  That two-hour, 24-minute film gives you A to Z a general overview of who the elite are, how they operate, what they're doing, and how they are the
[01:56:44.733 --> 01:56:48.734]  Developers, the progenitors of this sick society.
[01:56:48.734 --> 01:56:52.275]  And that's why I think it's so informative.
[01:56:52.275 --> 01:56:54.836]  Absolutely.
[01:56:54.836 --> 01:57:00.057]  I just, and like I said, my mom has been telling me this for years.
[01:57:00.057 --> 01:57:08.299]  And I kind of grew up around, I mean, you know, my mom was a, you know, 60s, 70s kind of hippie chick, whatever.
[01:57:10.549 --> 01:57:11.030]  What's going on?
[01:57:26.656 --> 01:57:29.978]  Push it on us as kids, you know.
[01:57:29.978 --> 01:57:34.861]  So the seeds were planted decades ago and now they've sprouted.
[01:57:34.861 --> 01:57:39.544]  See, again, my film didn't tell you really anything you didn't already know.
[01:57:39.544 --> 01:57:42.927]  You already knew it but hadn't consciously faced it.
[01:57:42.927 --> 01:57:44.708]  Again, those seeds were already there.
[01:57:44.708 --> 01:57:45.808]  That's what I'm saying.
[01:57:45.808 --> 01:57:54.114]  Patriots have planted billions of seeds worldwide and tyranny is the water and sunshine that makes them sprout.
[01:57:54.114 --> 01:57:54.234]  Yes.
[01:57:55.822 --> 01:58:01.224]  Yeah, you just woke up a whole new plant in my body.
[01:58:01.224 --> 01:58:05.385]  And I am going to just pass this on to everybody.
[01:58:05.385 --> 01:58:13.828]  I actually was talking to one of my co-workers the other day and I was telling her about the gun show incident in Texas.
[01:58:13.828 --> 01:58:14.808]  Yes.
[01:58:14.808 --> 01:58:22.550]  And she said, you know, Jessica, I'm so scared right now.
[01:58:22.550 --> 01:58:24.211]  I said, well, you know, we should be.
[01:58:25.754 --> 01:58:26.714]  We need to be scared.
[01:58:26.714 --> 01:58:29.555]  We need to be scared so that makes us aware.
[01:58:29.555 --> 01:58:30.015]  I agree.
[01:58:30.015 --> 01:58:31.075]  Jessica, good hearing from you.
[01:58:31.075 --> 01:58:33.256]  Look, let's say you get a grease fire in your house.
[01:58:33.256 --> 01:58:36.776]  You get scared for a second, but that makes you take action to put it out.
[01:58:36.776 --> 01:58:42.978]  So now, tell her, put that fear into action.
[01:58:42.978 --> 01:58:45.578]  Thank you for listening to GCN.

[02:00:32.754 --> 02:00:37.956]  Continuing with your calls, Curtis in Michigan, you're on the air, welcome.
[02:00:37.956 --> 02:00:41.317]  Hi, I'm from... Hi, this is Curtis from Montana.
[02:00:41.317 --> 02:00:43.577]  Okay, well they told me Michigan, go ahead.
[02:00:43.577 --> 02:00:49.979]  No, I'm from Montana, uh... No, you're not, Curtis, you're from Michigan!
[02:00:49.979 --> 02:00:51.780]  Okay, whatever, but uh...
[02:00:53.770 --> 02:00:59.372]  I'm a new listener, first time caller from Montana.
[02:00:59.372 --> 02:01:07.535]  I've been listening to you a lot about the gun show a couple days ago.
[02:01:07.535 --> 02:01:09.356]  We enjoy our freedoms in this state.
[02:01:09.356 --> 02:01:12.617]  We take pride in being one of the most free states.
[02:01:12.617 --> 02:01:22.161]  And I've been telling everyone I work with about that Austin gun show and I printed stuff that you made available on the internet about that Sustein guy.
[02:01:23.260 --> 02:01:44.334]  And, uh, I actually went to other... No one would believe me at work, because I guess you kind of got a reputation as a conspiracy theorist, so... I, uh, went and I found other places on the Internet, and I actually had the quotes, and then they, like, through the magazine, whatever, you know, or the newspaper, where all these quotes that you said, they were right there.
[02:01:44.334 --> 02:01:45.455]  So I highlighted them all.
[02:01:45.455 --> 02:01:52.320]  I took them to work and showed people, and I think people are finally starting to wake up, you know, a little bit in this country.
[02:01:57.051 --> 02:02:09.417]  Well, people are living in denial, but it's on the news that they shut the gun show down, and again, people just can't believe this is happening because they know it's tyranny.
[02:02:09.417 --> 02:02:20.603]  Yeah, I think the people are, we're so used to our comfortable lives in this country that no one can believe it's happening, even with the, you know, the 9-11 and our economy crashing, people are still in denial.
[02:02:20.603 --> 02:02:22.564]  What did they say once you showed them the proof?
[02:02:23.851 --> 02:02:35.301]  Then they still ask me, well, how come I haven't seen this on, and this is my other point, on Fox News or CNN, and that goes back to your Glenn Beck, your O'Reilly, your Hannity.
[02:02:35.301 --> 02:02:45.329]  I mean, some guys are so corrupt, and I could see right through them right after 9-11 started when they were saying that we should terrorize the terrorists.
[02:02:45.329 --> 02:02:49.833]  We should, you know, there's no such thing as abusing the terrorists.
[02:02:49.833 --> 02:02:52.255]  I mean, you could see right then that who's the real terrorist?
[02:02:53.004 --> 02:02:58.126]  Well, they will get it as the jackboot stomps on their face a little more.
[02:02:58.126 --> 02:03:00.446]  Good to hear from you, Curtis in Montana.
[02:03:00.446 --> 02:03:02.987]  Let's go to Randy in Florida.
[02:03:02.987 --> 02:03:04.908]  You're on the air, Randy.
[02:03:18.300 --> 02:03:19.781]  Afternoon Alex.
[02:03:19.781 --> 02:03:21.122]  Welcome.
[02:03:21.122 --> 02:03:29.766]  One quick thing, your website for your webmaster, the link to the Sunday Show page is not working.
[02:03:29.766 --> 02:03:33.548]  Okay, well send that to Kurt Nemo.
[02:03:33.548 --> 02:03:36.990]  I mean, are you saying a link to the archives of the show?
[02:03:36.990 --> 02:03:43.414]  No, the link on the homepage where it says Sunday Show, the link, when you click on it, does not work.
[02:03:44.261 --> 02:03:48.824]  Well, I mean, sir, the Listen Live links are what the Sunday Show streams off of.
[02:03:48.824 --> 02:03:51.565]  I mean, what particular link are you talking about?
[02:03:51.565 --> 02:03:55.487]  Well, anyway... No, no, I need to know the link!
[02:03:55.487 --> 02:03:57.489]  Hold on, hold on, whoa, whoa!
[02:03:57.489 --> 02:03:59.990]  Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!
[02:03:59.990 --> 02:04:00.550]  Whoa!
[02:04:00.550 --> 02:04:02.632]  I mean, I want to fix it.
[02:04:02.632 --> 02:04:06.894]  So just, what link is this?
[02:04:06.894 --> 02:04:10.076]  Well, I'll have to go back to it to tell you for sure.
[02:04:12.216 --> 02:04:13.157]  Okay, well thank you, Randy.
[02:04:13.157 --> 02:04:13.838]  We'll try to fix it.
[02:04:13.838 --> 02:04:14.699]  What else is on your mind?
[02:04:14.699 --> 02:04:18.122]  Hang on, I got an article I want to talk about.
[02:04:18.122 --> 02:04:18.983]  I just said, Randy.
[02:04:18.983 --> 02:04:22.467]  I just said, I just said, go ahead!
[02:04:22.467 --> 02:04:30.996]  Okay, on your page where there's an article about the Truth Alliance and you can't both support the truth and the Constitution.
[02:04:30.996 --> 02:04:34.180]  I don't know what you're talking about there.
[02:04:35.529 --> 02:04:36.810]  It's on your page today.
[02:04:36.810 --> 02:04:39.332]  It's an article from Truth Alliance.
[02:04:39.332 --> 02:04:43.776]  It says you can't both support the troops and the Constitution.
[02:04:43.776 --> 02:04:45.157]  I don't know that particular article.
[02:04:45.157 --> 02:04:47.018]  We post links to a lot of stuff.
[02:04:47.018 --> 02:04:48.199]  What is it dealing with?
[02:04:48.199 --> 02:04:49.240]  Military.
[02:04:49.240 --> 02:04:54.044]  Our military cannot be engaged in the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.
[02:04:55.861 --> 02:05:07.810]  This is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about the Ecola Blue Atmospheric Water Generator that produces pure drinking water right from the humidity in the air.
[02:05:07.810 --> 02:05:09.732]  No, this isn't science fiction, it's very real.

[02:06:00.560 --> 02:06:05.103]  This is Alex Jones with 5 good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[02:06:05.103 --> 02:06:06.023]  Number 1.
[02:06:06.023 --> 02:06:09.445]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[02:06:09.445 --> 02:06:10.305]  Number 2.
[02:06:10.305 --> 02:06:15.208]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[02:06:15.208 --> 02:06:15.949]  It's true.
[02:06:15.949 --> 02:06:20.811]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[02:06:20.811 --> 02:06:21.632]  Number 3.
[02:06:21.632 --> 02:06:25.234]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[02:06:25.234 --> 02:06:28.916]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[02:06:29.116 --> 02:06:29.917]  Number 4.
[02:06:29.917 --> 02:06:32.679]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[02:06:32.679 --> 02:06:36.362]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[02:06:36.362 --> 02:06:37.163]  Number 5.
[02:06:37.163 --> 02:06:41.307]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[02:06:41.307 --> 02:06:46.071]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[02:06:46.351 --> 02:06:50.518]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.

[02:07:00.987 --> 02:07:03.988]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[02:07:03.988 --> 02:07:09.311]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[02:07:09.311 --> 02:07:11.371]  My answer would be all I can get.
[02:07:11.371 --> 02:07:16.374]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[02:07:16.374 --> 02:07:17.554]  How much do you want?
[02:07:17.554 --> 02:07:18.675]  When do you want it?
[02:07:18.675 --> 02:07:20.555]  Now or after the battle starts?
[02:07:20.555 --> 02:07:21.636]  When will you need it?
[02:07:21.636 --> 02:07:23.837]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[02:07:23.837 --> 02:07:25.177]  Will there be any food?
[02:07:25.177 --> 02:07:26.478]  Will it make your children sick?
[02:07:26.698 --> 02:07:31.964]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[02:07:31.964 --> 02:07:35.548]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[02:07:35.548 --> 02:07:39.372]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[02:07:39.372 --> 02:07:40.613]  How much will you need?
[02:07:40.613 --> 02:07:41.514]  We don't know.
[02:07:41.514 --> 02:07:42.615]  How much do you want?
[02:07:42.615 --> 02:07:43.556]  All you can get.
[02:07:43.556 --> 02:07:44.357]  I'm Alex Jones.
[02:07:44.617 --> 02:07:47.679]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.
[02:07:47.679 --> 02:07:55.203]  Call 1-800-409-5633 or check it out on the web at efoodsdirect.com.
[02:07:55.203 --> 02:07:56.344]  Again, that number, 1-800-409-5633.
[02:07:56.344 --> 02:08:08.992]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show, because there's a war on for your mind.
[02:08:12.117 --> 02:08:14.637]  We are back live, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:08:14.637 --> 02:08:20.418]  We are simulcasting this radio show at PrisonPlanet.TV.
[02:08:20.418 --> 02:08:32.701]  All right, coming up, I want to go over the fact that big government, the New World Order agenda, is imploding on every front.
[02:08:32.701 --> 02:08:36.321]  But they still control the government, the bureaucracy, most of the planet.
[02:08:36.321 --> 02:08:37.341]  They're not going to go away.
[02:08:37.341 --> 02:08:41.062]  They're not going to stop unless we force them to go away, unless we force them to stop.
[02:08:42.386 --> 02:08:45.387]  But, there is a huge awakening happening.
[02:08:45.387 --> 02:08:49.129]  There is a lot of positive things going on.
[02:08:49.129 --> 02:08:51.470]  The state Senator Brown getting elected to the U.S.
[02:08:51.470 --> 02:08:56.472]  Senate is a very positive message to big government.
[02:08:56.472 --> 02:09:00.874]  There's a lot of news I want to cover coming up at the bottom of the hour in about 23 minutes from now.
[02:09:01.852 --> 02:09:04.713]  But I want to go back to your calls now.
[02:09:04.713 --> 02:09:05.914]  I want to try to start over.
[02:09:05.914 --> 02:09:11.776]  We had a rough start with Randy in Florida with me trying to understand exactly what he was getting at.
[02:09:11.776 --> 02:09:15.858]  There's an article from Truth Alliance.
[02:09:15.858 --> 02:09:20.020]  You can't both support the troops and the Constitution.
[02:09:20.020 --> 02:09:25.903]  And I actually agree with that because the media has miscast
[02:09:27.051 --> 02:09:28.753]  Supporting troops.
[02:09:28.753 --> 02:09:29.593]  Hitler said that.
[02:09:29.593 --> 02:09:31.956]  He said you've got to support my war against the U.S.
[02:09:31.956 --> 02:09:38.522]  and against England and against France and Russia or you don't support the troops.
[02:09:38.522 --> 02:09:46.750]  I have mainstream news articles where as soon as the troops are done serving they go through their barracks in Iraq and Afghanistan
[02:09:47.853 --> 02:09:54.879]  And in one case, the guy's stepdaughter, they mailed him a picture of her that was on their Facebook, of her in a bathing suit.
[02:09:54.879 --> 02:09:57.521]  And they said, a bathing suit is child pornography.
[02:09:57.521 --> 02:10:00.844]  This is ABC News, and he's being court-martialed for it.
[02:10:02.788 --> 02:10:06.809]  So they love persecuting the troops.
[02:10:06.809 --> 02:10:08.369]  They love going after them.
[02:10:08.369 --> 02:10:17.291]  Obama tried to cut their health care last year, and he wanted to make the troops pay for their own health care through getting their own insurance.
[02:10:17.291 --> 02:10:22.352]  Making the troops serve two, three, four tours is not supporting the troops.
[02:10:22.352 --> 02:10:24.932]  Starting all these new wars is not supporting them.
[02:10:24.932 --> 02:10:28.073]  Congress never declared war since World War II.
[02:10:29.074 --> 02:10:31.885]  Not in Vietnam, not in Desert Storm 1, in none of these events.
[02:10:36.067 --> 02:10:38.188]  Was war declared.
[02:10:38.188 --> 02:10:46.330]  Congress said, well, for WMDs in Iraq, for nukes, you do have this limited mandate to remove the weapons, which you didn't have.
[02:10:46.330 --> 02:10:48.510]  So I'm trying to understand what Randy is getting at.
[02:10:48.510 --> 02:10:50.311]  Randy, do you agree?
[02:10:50.311 --> 02:10:51.291]  Do you disagree?
[02:10:51.291 --> 02:10:56.172]  I mean, for me, it's the definition of supporting the troops.
[02:10:56.172 --> 02:11:01.234]  It's not supporting the troops, sending them into preemptive illegal wars or having
[02:11:02.114 --> 02:11:06.998]  Military people in offices in D.C.
[02:11:06.998 --> 02:11:12.943]  controlling predator drones, dropping bombs on weddings in Pakistan.
[02:11:12.943 --> 02:11:15.466]  So, I mean, what are you getting at here?
[02:11:15.466 --> 02:11:21.991]  What I'm saying is that the Constitution requires a declaration of war, and as you said, it hasn't been done since World War II.
[02:11:21.991 --> 02:11:28.677]  And so, any order to deploy to these wars is unconstitutional and unlawful, and even more so, importantly, it's immoral.
[02:11:29.249 --> 02:11:51.872]  And our soldiers should refuse that if they're going to take their oath seriously, and that includes the members of this Oath Keepers website, which as far as I'm concerned is felony because many of the members on that site are active duty military, serving in Iraq, or have served in Iraq and Afghanistan, yet they claim they're keeping their oath when they engage in unlawful and unconstitutional activity.
[02:11:51.872 --> 02:11:52.553]  It can't be done.
[02:11:54.059 --> 02:12:05.128]  Well, particularly the Oath Keepers are saying we're going to follow the Declaration of Independence, Constitution, and they're trying to educate people that don't confiscate guns in the U.S.
[02:12:05.128 --> 02:12:07.249]  if you're ordered, and things like that.
[02:12:07.249 --> 02:12:09.651]  And I mean, I think overall they're very positive.
[02:12:09.651 --> 02:12:13.334]  That's why Chris Matthews and others are viciously attacking him.
[02:12:13.334 --> 02:12:14.855]  But I appreciate your call, Randy.
[02:12:14.855 --> 02:12:16.857]  Glad you called.
[02:12:16.857 --> 02:12:18.138]  Let me give you this article right here.
[02:12:18.138 --> 02:12:18.698]  This is out of W...
[02:12:20.481 --> 02:12:24.563]  GN Radio, but it's also, I saw an ABC News article about it.
[02:12:24.563 --> 02:12:26.544]  Galesburg.
[02:12:26.544 --> 02:12:31.586]  An Illinois National Guard soldier in Afghanistan has been charged by the U.S.
[02:12:31.586 --> 02:12:37.449]  Army with possessing child pornography over pictures of a young relative his mother says she sent him.
[02:12:37.449 --> 02:12:39.230]  He didn't even take the picture.
[02:12:39.230 --> 02:12:46.053]  But what's crazy about this is that the photo that the news showed
[02:12:47.270 --> 02:13:11.144]  is several photos of a little girl running around in the yard playing with a water hose and in one of them it shows the back of the bathing suit and that the army put the report out saying because part of her lower butt is shown this is child porn and folks I see articles now they're mainstream news we saw the ABC News cover that big case in Arizona last year
[02:13:12.472 --> 02:13:16.815]  Where it didn't even show the little girl's bodies.
[02:13:16.815 --> 02:13:19.377]  One was two, one was three.
[02:13:19.377 --> 02:13:24.700]  They got out of the bathtub, they had towels around them, and their mom took a photo.
[02:13:24.700 --> 02:13:26.622]  Every parent has done that.
[02:13:26.622 --> 02:13:33.646]  Plus, you got two, three, four kids, you know, the littler ones, you stick them in the bathtub together while they play with rubber duckies and boats or whatever.
[02:13:33.646 --> 02:13:40.331]  The government's now got cases saying kids together in a bathtub is some type of sexual assault on the two children.
[02:13:41.721 --> 02:13:44.462]  Meanwhile, the government's full of all these degenerate pedophiles.
[02:13:44.462 --> 02:13:46.403]  They're constantly getting caught.
[02:13:46.403 --> 02:13:49.905]  Most of your top CPS people are always being busted.
[02:13:49.905 --> 02:13:56.688]  They're five to seven times more likely, depending on the federal government report, to be pedophiles or abusers in government.
[02:13:56.688 --> 02:14:08.133]  And they're saying a photo of two little girls, one with a towel around her, another with a towel around her, with them beside each other, they said that was having them engaged in sexual activity.
[02:14:08.133 --> 02:14:08.734]  Because they were
[02:14:09.690 --> 02:14:11.991]  You know, huddled with towels out of the bath.
[02:14:11.991 --> 02:14:18.993]  See, now they're going to take your kids for wearing bathing suits at the swimming pool.
[02:14:18.993 --> 02:14:20.633]  And you'll say, but it's a bathing suit.
[02:14:20.633 --> 02:14:23.894]  And they'll say, we have SWAT teams.
[02:14:23.894 --> 02:14:26.755]  Now, we'll ban your gun show even if it's legal.
[02:14:26.755 --> 02:14:30.116]  You know, oh, an old man was cleaning his gun in his garage in Everside.
[02:14:30.116 --> 02:14:32.436]  He had 12 guns and a couple thousand rounds of ammo.
[02:14:32.436 --> 02:14:33.157]  That's an arsenal.
[02:14:33.157 --> 02:14:34.837]  There's no law against it.
[02:14:34.837 --> 02:14:36.158]  It isn't an arsenal.
[02:14:36.158 --> 02:14:36.818]  There's no law.
[02:14:36.818 --> 02:14:37.558]  You still go to prison.
[02:14:39.605 --> 02:14:42.086]  I mean, they send people to prison every day for not even committing crimes.
[02:14:42.086 --> 02:14:47.449]  They just make up other folks.
[02:14:47.449 --> 02:14:51.831]  It just came home to me again yesterday.
[02:14:51.831 --> 02:14:55.153]  Again, just how criminal and illegitimate this government is.
[02:14:55.153 --> 02:15:05.758]  Because Matt Ryan, who works in our office, worked at the city in the gas and electric customer service line.
[02:15:08.556 --> 02:15:11.460]  And he said upwards of 90% or more.
[02:15:11.460 --> 02:15:14.244]  In fact, he said they never pay.
[02:15:14.244 --> 02:15:23.517]  He said 10% of the time, and they had huge meetings about this, the illegals pay the first bill of the $250 to get their power and gas turned on.
[02:15:24.986 --> 02:15:32.092]  And then, three months later, when they turn their power off, another person calls with another consulate matricula that are fake IDs.
[02:15:32.092 --> 02:15:34.154]  The Mexican consulate gives them to anybody.
[02:15:34.154 --> 02:15:34.854]  I can go get one.
[02:15:34.854 --> 02:15:37.096]  There's been investigative reports on it.
[02:15:37.096 --> 02:15:39.198]  And then they just never pay.
[02:15:39.198 --> 02:15:42.741]  They only pay when they first get it turned on or get it turned back on.
[02:15:42.741 --> 02:15:43.761]  And then that's passed on.
[02:15:43.761 --> 02:15:48.185]  But then an old lady who's $10 down on her bill, they turn their power off.
[02:15:48.185 --> 02:15:52.769]  And you've seen those reports of them freezing to death or burning up to death in the summer all over the country.
[02:15:57.915 --> 02:16:01.036]  I mean, I saw this winner every two or three days.
[02:16:01.036 --> 02:16:03.316]  In fact, let's just Google it live on air.
[02:16:03.316 --> 02:16:04.576]  Man dies in home.
[02:16:04.576 --> 02:16:07.257]  Man freezes to death in home after power turned off.
[02:16:07.257 --> 02:16:13.678]  I mean, you'll just see hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of reports where this is happening.
[02:16:13.678 --> 02:16:15.479]  And so there's so many facets to this.
[02:16:15.479 --> 02:16:20.240]  The illegal aliens all over, there's more than 800 sanctuary cities.
[02:16:21.667 --> 02:16:24.069]  And I've had R-Day surveyed of the police chief Austin.
[02:16:24.069 --> 02:16:25.811]  He said, Alex, we have to do this.
[02:16:25.811 --> 02:16:29.814]  We have to know who these people are so we can protect them when there's a problem.
[02:16:29.814 --> 02:16:35.539]  That doesn't stop illegals from calling if there's a problem at their home.
[02:16:35.539 --> 02:16:39.081]  You know, this isn't some sanctuary where there's a commission of a crime.
[02:16:39.081 --> 02:16:43.925]  And so if you call with a crime or a problem, they don't arrest you or deport you.
[02:16:43.925 --> 02:16:46.668]  See, that's how they started sanctuaries 20 years ago.
[02:16:47.765 --> 02:16:51.506]  Now, we're going to hire illegal aliens for the police force.
[02:16:51.506 --> 02:16:53.427]  That's Associated Press.
[02:16:53.427 --> 02:16:58.088]  We're going to say you can have everything without an ID card.
[02:16:58.088 --> 02:16:59.048]  You can have a bank account.
[02:16:59.048 --> 02:17:00.449]  You can have a housing loan.
[02:17:00.449 --> 02:17:06.150]  But citizens have to show three IDs to get power or gas.
[02:17:06.150 --> 02:17:08.231]  And the minute you don't pay, you're in trouble.
[02:17:08.231 --> 02:17:14.853]  I talked to one of my old family friends, who is the manager of some of the biggest apartment complexes in Austin.
[02:17:16.542 --> 02:17:23.868]  And it was like four years ago, she got called up to the Christmas corporate party in Dallas for one of the... I mean, I'll let you know the company.
[02:17:23.868 --> 02:17:29.772]  It's the one whose executive got indicted and then his car blew up and his body burned up, staged his death last year.
[02:17:29.772 --> 02:17:35.396]  And they called him in and they said, the federal government is secretly subsidizing us.
[02:17:35.396 --> 02:17:36.417]  You're to tell no one.
[02:17:36.417 --> 02:17:39.779]  This is with hundreds of their top managers in the auditorium.
[02:17:40.985 --> 02:17:44.990]  Illegals are allowed to be 10 to a one-person apartment.
[02:17:44.990 --> 02:17:52.320]  If citizens even have a grandmother visiting for a week, kick them out with the one-person occupancy rule.
[02:17:52.320 --> 02:17:53.441]  Illegals are above the law.
[02:17:54.497 --> 02:17:59.619]  And Aaron Dykes, Rob Jacobson, you know, are in moderately low-priced apartments nearby.
[02:17:59.619 --> 02:18:02.421]  They're not bad apartments, pretty nice.
[02:18:02.421 --> 02:18:09.824]  The illegals have chickens running around, sides of beef hanging up, mariachi bands literally playing till 5 in the morning.
[02:18:09.824 --> 02:18:10.984]  They are God.
[02:18:10.984 --> 02:18:12.505]  The police won't come.
[02:18:12.505 --> 02:18:13.926]  No one will stop them.
[02:18:13.926 --> 02:18:15.006]  Drunk driving.
[02:18:15.006 --> 02:18:16.067]  They are not arrested.
[02:18:16.067 --> 02:18:16.807]  No ID.
[02:18:16.807 --> 02:18:18.888]  I've had Austin Police admit it to me.
[02:18:18.888 --> 02:18:20.649]  They are literally gods.
[02:18:22.060 --> 02:18:23.922]  Literally gods.
[02:18:23.922 --> 02:18:34.955]  Because the government wants them here to drive down wages, to bankrupt the society, and to become a political force to pull the lever for gun control and open borders and higher taxes.
[02:18:34.955 --> 02:18:36.717]  It is a lawless government.
[02:18:36.717 --> 02:18:38.839]  They won't follow the state or federal law.
[02:18:38.839 --> 02:18:40.721]  They won't follow the drunk driving laws.
[02:18:40.721 --> 02:18:41.822]  The police don't enforce.
[02:18:42.443 --> 02:19:00.730]  But citizens, you take a photo of your five-year-old daughter in a bathing suit at the pool, and you take it to Walmart or some other place, they've been told, get me a SWAT team, bring in the pedophile units, and here come the pot-bellied, here come the pot-bellied CPS, and they're ready for your kids that night, they're going to enjoy themselves.
[02:19:00.730 --> 02:19:10.954]  Texas Commission on Youth, giant rape rooms, every facility raping kids, giant pedophile guild, they look at those kids in a bathing suit, and they go, take them, I want them right now.
[02:19:12.111 --> 02:19:13.812]  They're going to be mine.
[02:19:13.812 --> 02:19:18.934]  And that's who they are, and they run everything, and they've got the automatic weapons, and they rule.
[02:19:18.934 --> 02:19:20.435]  That's the end of it.
[02:19:20.435 --> 02:19:25.417]  And they're going to take your bank accounts, they're going to take everything else you've got, because they feel like it.
[02:19:25.417 --> 02:19:27.478]  You have a lawless criminal government.
[02:19:27.478 --> 02:19:31.961]  There's no law against this gun show, we don't care, we're shutting it down.
[02:19:31.961 --> 02:19:37.003]  There's a law against illegals drunk driving, we're not enforcing.
[02:19:37.003 --> 02:19:40.585]  Because we're your criminal government, and we rule you, and we decide what to do.
[02:19:41.499 --> 02:19:43.980]  More calls straight ahead.
[02:19:43.980 --> 02:19:50.441]  But it says the pictures show the child in a swimsuit playing in a wading pool.
[02:19:50.441 --> 02:19:56.562]  And it says, in one photo, part of the girl's hip can be seen.
[02:19:56.562 --> 02:19:57.523]  Oh!
[02:19:57.523 --> 02:20:03.004]  That's it!
[02:20:03.004 --> 02:20:05.904]  Our economy is in great distress.
[02:20:05.904 --> 02:20:08.685]  The financial dominoes can fall at any time.
[02:20:09.438 --> 02:20:14.960]  It's time to stop hoping it doesn't happen and prepare just in case it does.
[02:20:14.960 --> 02:20:17.620]  You have auto and home insurance.
[02:20:17.620 --> 02:20:20.841]  Why wouldn't you have food insurance?
[02:20:20.841 --> 02:20:24.122]  Are you prepared to feed your family long term?
[02:20:24.122 --> 02:20:26.783]  Because it might take years to recover.
[02:20:26.783 --> 02:20:32.445]  As the adult, it's your responsibility to feed your family, especially during rough times.
[02:20:33.311 --> 02:20:40.655]  SurvivalistSeeds.com is offering a package that will give you a 3-acre heirloom vegetable garden anywhere.
[02:20:40.655 --> 02:20:48.760]  50 heirloom varieties, 8,000 vegetable seeds, over 5 pounds of healthy food.
[02:20:48.760 --> 02:20:53.243]  Don't be fooled by marketing companies disguised as patriots.
[02:20:53.243 --> 02:20:59.066]  SurvivalistSeeds.com is owned by Big John Lipscomb, host of Don't Tread on Me radio show.
[02:21:02.603 --> 02:21:06.651]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[02:21:06.651 --> 02:21:09.898]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[02:21:09.898 --> 02:21:11.300]  As we're finishing off this agenda...
[02:21:12.006 --> 02:21:14.668]  They'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[02:21:14.668 --> 02:21:21.073]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[02:21:21.073 --> 02:21:26.617]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[02:21:26.617 --> 02:21:36.245]  For the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation, the criminal offshore cartel, hell-bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government.
[02:21:36.365 --> 02:21:38.707]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists!
[02:21:38.707 --> 02:21:40.308]  They're asking for more matches!
[02:21:40.308 --> 02:21:42.750]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[02:21:42.750 --> 02:21:44.892]  Today seems like nobody does care.
[02:21:44.892 --> 02:21:50.036]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[02:21:50.036 --> 02:21:55.000]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com.
[02:21:55.000 --> 02:21:59.144]  We're watching online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[02:22:01.005 --> 02:22:07.330]  Did you know that the dollar has lost 10% of its value against other currencies in the last 90 days?
[02:22:07.330 --> 02:22:12.274]  Ever think about how inflation will change your life, your savings, your retirement plans?
[02:22:12.274 --> 02:22:16.357]  Remember inflation in Zimbabwe, Argentina, the Weimar Republic?
[02:22:16.357 --> 02:22:17.698]  Let's put this another way.
[02:22:17.698 --> 02:22:23.062]  Who cares if your investments go up 10% but you lose 40% of your purchasing power?
[02:22:23.062 --> 02:22:25.964]  Gold still buys the same amount of stuff it always did.
[02:22:25.964 --> 02:22:28.606]  Gold does not require trust in a third party.
[02:22:28.606 --> 02:22:30.328]  You can possess it in your hand.
[02:22:30.328 --> 02:22:30.828]  You can take it
[02:22:31.569 --> 02:22:33.050]  Gold is real money.
[02:22:33.050 --> 02:22:34.411]  Gold is honest money.
[02:22:34.411 --> 02:22:37.133]  My name is Daniel Larson from Midas Resources.

[02:22:45.158 --> 02:22:46.099]  800-686-2237 extension 134.
[02:23:01.161 --> 02:23:01.841]  Hello.

[02:23:16.468 --> 02:23:21.152]  As a homesteader attempting to live sustainably, I was floored by the amount of information in this book.
[02:23:21.152 --> 02:23:25.375]  Dear Linda, I would be hard pressed to express how much you have impacted my life.
[02:23:25.375 --> 02:23:29.739]  I'm amazed by the wealth of the author's knowledge and the depth of the coverage in this book.
[02:23:29.739 --> 02:23:34.282]  As we see more and more GMO foods on the shelves, this information is good to know.
[02:23:34.282 --> 02:23:36.144]  I am thankful to God for you, Linda.
[02:23:36.564 --> 02:23:38.526]  I can't say enough about this book.
[02:23:38.526 --> 02:23:40.428]  Blessings to you and your family.
[02:23:40.428 --> 02:23:46.133]  The greatest effect this book has had on me and my family is that we truly see Earth's bounty everywhere.
[02:23:46.133 --> 02:23:49.556]  Folks, thanks for letting us help you get back to basics.
[02:23:49.556 --> 02:23:53.139]  Read all of the testimonials at ofthefield.com.

[02:24:01.328 --> 02:24:02.048]  Austin News at noon.
[02:24:02.048 --> 02:24:05.370]  We're covering some breaking news out of the Texas State Capitol.
[02:24:05.370 --> 02:24:07.352]  Shots fired at the Texas State Capitol.
[02:24:07.352 --> 02:24:11.954]  No injuries reported immediately, but they do say one person is in custody.
[02:24:11.954 --> 02:24:14.976]  That's your live picture right now from the downtown tower cam.
[02:24:14.976 --> 02:24:16.217]  Front steps to the Capitol there.
[02:24:16.217 --> 02:24:23.601]  They're reporting six DPS cars responded to that area, and legislative offices told to lock their doors and stay inside.
[02:24:23.601 --> 02:24:28.304]  We have Angie Woodring on the phone now, a witness that was at the Capitol when this allegedly occurred.
[02:24:28.304 --> 02:24:28.924]  Angie, are you there?
[02:24:28.924 --> 02:24:29.845]  Yes, sir.
[02:24:30.325 --> 02:24:32.666]  Good afternoon, can you tell us what happened?
[02:24:32.666 --> 02:24:39.831]  Well, yeah, we were, we had just been inside the Capitol building, had just walked over to the visitor's center to look around.
[02:24:39.831 --> 02:24:55.120]  We walked out of the visitor's center and suddenly heard five or six distinctive shots and saw security rush a gentleman on the front of the state capitol steps and then tell everybody to get away and people were running and
[02:24:56.209 --> 02:25:04.238]  They were not letting anybody in or out now and then about five minutes after we saw the security officers form the gentleman on the front bench.
[02:25:18.010 --> 02:25:21.993]  Well, shots fired at the Texas Capitol just a few miles from where I am.
[02:25:21.993 --> 02:25:25.435]  I'm dispatching some camera crews down there right now.
[02:25:25.435 --> 02:25:26.016]  I'm going to need to
[02:25:28.086 --> 02:25:29.988]  Clear the phone lines.
[02:25:29.988 --> 02:25:32.390]  I apologize to those patiently holding.
[02:25:32.390 --> 02:25:36.514]  You'll be able to call back in and get to the front of the line.
[02:25:36.514 --> 02:25:47.844]  Tessa, Larry, Matt, Bob, write their names down and they'll be able to call back in after I open the phones up specifically for any eyewitnesses that are our listeners or anyone at the Capitol.
[02:25:47.844 --> 02:25:50.927]  I know a lot of legislative aides are listeners.
[02:25:50.927 --> 02:25:54.049]  I know a lot of our listeners work downtown in and around the Capitol.
[02:25:54.650 --> 02:25:57.212]  1-800-259-9231.
[02:25:57.212 --> 02:26:04.037]  The bombing of the governor's mansion was clearly a staged event.
[02:26:04.037 --> 02:26:07.779]  All the evidence in hindsight, we weren't sure at the time, points towards that.
[02:26:07.779 --> 02:26:10.661]  I've told you I believe a false flag.
[02:26:10.661 --> 02:26:14.344]  I said this, what, three weeks ago.
[02:26:17.622 --> 02:26:25.894]  When it came out that federal agents were trying to provocateur people into firebombing Brave New Books, trying to connect it into 9-11 truthers.
[02:26:29.246 --> 02:26:31.989]  Then groups connected into those same organizations.
[02:26:31.989 --> 02:26:36.754]  The media tried to say that they were involved in firebombing the governor's mansion.
[02:26:36.754 --> 02:26:39.838]  And did they get some mentally ill person to go do this?
[02:26:39.838 --> 02:26:40.659]  God only knows.
[02:26:40.659 --> 02:26:42.080]  Or is it just a crazy person?
[02:26:42.080 --> 02:26:44.323]  Thank God no one was injured.
[02:26:44.323 --> 02:26:45.264]  No one was injured.
[02:26:45.264 --> 02:26:48.207]  Shots fired at Texas Capitol, Austin, Texas.
[02:26:48.968 --> 02:26:54.831]  Texas State Police said one person is in custody after gunshots were fired on the south steps of the Texas Capitol.
[02:26:54.831 --> 02:26:56.892]  They're gonna use this to pass anti-gun bills.
[02:26:56.892 --> 02:26:58.032]  You just watch.
[02:26:58.032 --> 02:27:00.193]  Luckily, no injuries are reported.
[02:27:00.193 --> 02:27:04.996]  More than a half dozen Texas Department of Public Safety cars descended on the Capitol Thursday.
[02:27:04.996 --> 02:27:06.216]  Yeah, they're already there.
[02:27:06.216 --> 02:27:10.358]  Afternoon, and officers toting rifles surrounded the building.
[02:27:10.358 --> 02:27:15.060]  The officers were in the process of securing the Capitol's third floor around noon.
[02:27:15.060 --> 02:27:15.120]  So...
[02:27:18.114 --> 02:27:20.795]  This is now all over the national media.
[02:27:36.846 --> 02:27:39.147]  I've told you look for false flag attacks.
[02:27:39.147 --> 02:27:41.027]  We told you the flu thing was fake.
[02:27:41.027 --> 02:27:42.948]  That's now admitted mainstream media.
[02:27:42.948 --> 02:27:48.469]  A giant fear-mongering, federalization, UN globalization, profit drill.
[02:27:48.469 --> 02:27:50.929]  We've told you so many of these events are staged.
[02:27:50.929 --> 02:27:55.911]  We don't know about this one at this time.
[02:27:55.911 --> 02:28:00.012]  But the first report came out about 52 minutes ago.
[02:28:02.130 --> 02:28:08.296]  And the latest report came out about 15 minutes ago from KXAN.
[02:28:08.296 --> 02:28:12.060]  So we're continuing to monitor that situation.
[02:28:12.060 --> 02:28:17.825]  Shots fired at the Texas Capitol building.
[02:28:17.825 --> 02:28:23.471]  Remember when somebody drove a gasoline truck into the California building, California State House?
[02:28:25.063 --> 02:28:29.106]  You didn't really ever hear much about that because it looked like it was a real event.
[02:28:29.106 --> 02:28:33.749]  If this is staged, they'll hype it to the stars.
[02:28:33.749 --> 02:28:34.189]  But 1-800-259-9231.
[02:28:34.189 --> 02:28:34.269]  1-800-259-9231.
[02:28:34.269 --> 02:28:40.273]  If we don't get any eyewitnesses, we're gonna hold the lines open for Tessa, Larry, Matt, Bob, and others that were patiently holding.
[02:28:40.273 --> 02:28:40.333]  1-800-259-9231.
[02:28:55.990 --> 02:29:01.395]  It'll only take a few dozen of these type of events to try to scare government into going along with the police state.
[02:29:01.395 --> 02:29:07.640]  Just like an underwear bomber has been used to say everybody's got a naked body scan to fly and all the courthouses are going to get it.
[02:29:07.640 --> 02:29:13.065]  A real attack, that's not going to stop somebody from going up against the Capitol or a courthouse.
[02:29:13.065 --> 02:29:14.907]  It'll just stop somebody from sneaking one in.
[02:29:14.907 --> 02:29:21.212]  Everybody can't be treated as if they're guilty and lose their Second Amendment because there's a few nuts out there.
[02:29:21.212 --> 02:29:22.613]  And with so many of these events,
[02:29:23.599 --> 02:29:30.182]  Uh, it is staged, but they're also forcing the population, more and more people, into this mindset.
[02:29:30.182 --> 02:29:30.762]  1-800-259-9231.
[02:29:30.762 --> 02:29:32.103]  We can also take local calls.
[02:29:32.103 --> 02:29:32.163]  512-646-1776.
[02:29:32.163 --> 02:29:32.343]  512-646-1776.
[02:29:32.343 --> 02:29:34.604]  Specifically, for people who are eyewitnesses to this situation.
[02:29:34.604 --> 02:29:35.885]  We'll be right back after the break.
[02:29:35.885 --> 02:29:36.205]  Stay with us.
[02:29:51.900 --> 02:29:53.281]  We're on the march.
[02:29:53.281 --> 02:29:55.822]  The Empire's on the run.
[02:29:55.822 --> 02:30:01.003]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:01.003 --> 02:30:05.125]  This is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about the Ecola Blue Atmospheric Water Generator.
[02:30:05.125 --> 02:30:08.006]  It produces pure drinking water right from the humidity in the air.
[02:30:08.006 --> 02:30:09.267]  No, this isn't science fiction.

[02:31:00.723 --> 02:31:05.287]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[02:31:05.287 --> 02:31:06.187]  Number one.
[02:31:06.187 --> 02:31:09.610]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[02:31:09.610 --> 02:31:10.471]  Number two.
[02:31:10.471 --> 02:31:15.375]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[02:31:15.375 --> 02:31:16.115]  It's true.
[02:31:16.115 --> 02:31:20.659]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[02:31:20.979 --> 02:31:21.800]  Number 3.
[02:31:21.800 --> 02:31:25.383]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[02:31:25.383 --> 02:31:29.307]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[02:31:29.307 --> 02:31:30.107]  Number 4.
[02:31:30.107 --> 02:31:32.870]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[02:31:32.870 --> 02:31:36.553]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[02:31:36.553 --> 02:31:37.334]  Number 5.
[02:31:37.334 --> 02:31:41.478]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[02:31:41.478 --> 02:31:46.242]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[02:31:46.522 --> 02:31:50.685]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[02:31:50.685 --> 02:31:52.487]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[02:31:52.487 --> 02:31:54.749]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun.
[02:31:54.749 --> 02:31:57.070]  So go to mysolarbackup.com or call 1-877-327-0365.
[02:32:02.401 --> 02:32:06.362]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about the Silver Lungs Generator.
[02:32:06.362 --> 02:32:15.225]  Now you can produce pure and endless colloidal silver and deliver the solution directly into the bloodstream by breathing the solution through the lungs.
[02:32:15.225 --> 02:32:19.846]  The respiratory system is the first line of defense for airborne pathogens and viruses.
[02:32:19.846 --> 02:32:30.669]  The Silver Lungs Generator infuses the respiratory system with your self-produced nanosilver solutions and also delivers the silver nanoparticles instantly into the bloodstream.
[02:32:31.309 --> 02:32:40.812]  With continued legislation threatening the sale of nano silver products, you can now produce pure and endless colloidal silver with the Silver Lungs Generator.
[02:32:40.812 --> 02:32:46.254]  Very easy to follow step-by-step instructions are provided, making production fast and simple.
[02:32:46.254 --> 02:32:53.737]  Go to www.SilverLungs.com today and learn more about the breakthrough technology of the Silver Lungs Generator.
[02:32:53.737 --> 02:32:56.478]  That's www.SilverLungs.com.
[02:33:04.255 --> 02:33:10.899]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[02:33:10.899 --> 02:33:18.003]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:33:18.003 --> 02:33:24.827]  We are lining up some eyewitnesses that are calling into the local line about what they saw at the
[02:33:26.240 --> 02:33:29.802]  Capitol shots fired at Texas Capitol building.
[02:33:29.802 --> 02:33:34.924]  Texas State Police said one person in custody after gunshots were fired on the south steps of the Texas Capitol.
[02:33:34.924 --> 02:33:38.346]  Luckily, no injuries are reported.
[02:33:38.346 --> 02:33:40.306]  That sounds so staged, folks.
[02:33:40.306 --> 02:33:50.871]  More than half a dozen Texas Department of Public Safety cars descended on the Capitol Thursday afternoon as officers toting rifles surrounded the building.
[02:33:50.871 --> 02:33:53.893]  The officers were in the process of securing the Capitol's third floor.
[02:33:54.878 --> 02:33:57.980]  And it goes on, the building is in lockdown as the suspect is in custody.
[02:33:57.980 --> 02:34:06.966]  DPS spokeswoman Lisa Block said a witness said he heard at least four shots fired.
[02:34:06.966 --> 02:34:09.527]  And so, again, we've had a lot of people call in.
[02:34:09.527 --> 02:34:13.910]  We're trying to find out exactly who is actually a witness right now.
[02:34:16.894 --> 02:34:19.556]  I have all this other news that I want to go over.
[02:34:19.556 --> 02:34:32.523]  No one called into the Genesis line, so those callers who we hung up on to open the phone lines, we are now going to open the phones back up for the folks that were already on hold to call back in.
[02:34:32.523 --> 02:34:37.787]  Please give them a chance, folks, and then you can try to call in.
[02:34:37.787 --> 02:34:38.207]  1-800-259-9231.
[02:34:38.207 --> 02:34:44.531]  Guys, you've got a photo of the person being arrested just a little while ago, and it looks like drug out of the Capitol.
[02:34:45.051 --> 02:34:49.293]  Looks like APD is helping the state police carry him.
[02:34:49.293 --> 02:34:51.974]  It's five officers helping carry him out.
[02:34:51.974 --> 02:34:55.715]  Can you blow that up so we can see the individual's face?
[02:34:55.715 --> 02:34:57.956]  Continue blowing it up.
[02:34:57.956 --> 02:35:00.417]  Continue blowing it up.
[02:35:00.417 --> 02:35:03.758]  I can't tell if it's a white male or a Hispanic male.
[02:35:03.758 --> 02:35:06.779]  Looks like it's a white male with a tan.
[02:35:06.779 --> 02:35:10.601]  I don't know guys, that look like a white or Hispanic person to you.
[02:35:10.601 --> 02:35:11.341]  Give me your judgment.
[02:35:12.432 --> 02:35:14.553]  Looks like a white guy, doesn't it?
[02:35:14.553 --> 02:35:15.894]  But like a carpenter.
[02:35:15.894 --> 02:35:19.296]  He's got a deep, deep tan.
[02:35:19.296 --> 02:35:21.057]  White t-shirt.
[02:35:21.057 --> 02:35:25.780]  Military-style haircut.
[02:35:25.780 --> 02:35:27.441]  My God.
[02:35:27.441 --> 02:35:30.843]  They're going to have a heyday with this against our Second Amendment.
[02:35:30.843 --> 02:35:35.246]  No matter what they pull, no matter what they do, don't let them get your guns, folks.
[02:35:35.246 --> 02:35:37.488]  They want to make us live like Chicago or people in New York.
[02:35:38.257 --> 02:35:40.378]  We have got to stand against this together.
[02:35:40.378 --> 02:35:44.459]  Those calls that came in to the local line, were any of them eyewitnesses?
[02:35:44.459 --> 02:35:45.619]  Okay, we're going to leave.
[02:35:45.619 --> 02:35:46.380]  This is what we're going to do.
[02:35:46.380 --> 02:35:48.180]  I forgot we had our own phone system.
[02:35:48.180 --> 02:35:58.844]  We're going to have our phone system open here in my studio for any eyewitnesses or for calls specifically from Austin on the Capitol.
[02:36:00.356 --> 02:36:05.240]  And again, I want to punch up on screen that the number for locals to call is 512-646-1776.
[02:36:05.240 --> 02:36:05.340]  512-646-1776.
[02:36:05.340 --> 02:36:09.703]  If you want to talk about the Capitol situation and for listeners generally across the country,
[02:36:24.431 --> 02:36:25.491]  This got me sidetracked.
[02:36:25.491 --> 02:36:35.035]  I wanted to go over a news blitz right now, but I'm just going to continue with your calls because in the next hour I'm going to get into more of the news we haven't covered yet.
[02:36:35.035 --> 02:36:38.056]  I've alluded to a lot of it, but I don't want to really drill into some of it.
[02:36:38.056 --> 02:36:39.357]  Let's go to calls right now.
[02:36:39.357 --> 02:36:41.037]  Rob in Hawaii, you're on the air.
[02:36:41.037 --> 02:36:43.838]  Thanks for taking my call.
[02:36:43.838 --> 02:36:44.399]  Thanks for calling.
[02:36:44.399 --> 02:36:44.919]  What's on your mind?
[02:36:45.911 --> 02:36:51.435]  Um, well, first I wanted to thank you for how you ended your show yesterday, like, stressing a peaceful resistance.
[02:36:51.435 --> 02:37:02.663]  Um, because myself, I'm a former Marine, and I could tell you 13 years ago, my company commander was going around asking our platoon if we would, uh, raise weapons or disarm our own brothers, flat out.
[02:37:02.663 --> 02:37:05.404]  This was 13 years ago.
[02:37:05.404 --> 02:37:06.745]  Yeah, that's standard procedure.
[02:37:06.745 --> 02:37:08.987]  The military now trains to take on the American people.
[02:37:08.987 --> 02:37:10.168]  Go ahead.
[02:37:10.168 --> 02:37:10.868]  Oh, absolutely.
[02:37:10.868 --> 02:37:14.911]  Um, so what I was going to say, like, people need to understand, any sort of armed or violent
[02:37:15.543 --> 02:37:15.663]  Sure.
[02:37:30.933 --> 02:37:53.210]  For about a week one time I ran for Republican State House because nobody was running against the Democrat, but when I saw the rules and the campaign rules and I just couldn't stomach going out and trying to raise the money and I really, I was talked into it and my gut was I can do more outside the system than I can in the system educating people.
[02:37:53.210 --> 02:37:54.972]  Right, I understand that fully.
[02:37:54.972 --> 02:37:58.614]  Okay, my second question is back on yesterday you were talking about 9-11 Truth.
[02:38:00.083 --> 02:38:10.270]  Um, when Charlie Sheen released that, uh, video message to the President, like, it really inspired me to go research how many other celebrities have spoken out, because I wanted to make myself a few YouTube videos.
[02:38:10.270 --> 02:38:14.873]  And I ended up finding so many footage of so many celebrities, like, it just blows my mind.
[02:38:14.873 --> 02:38:26.482]  So I was wondering if there's any way you or someone you know could kind of organize all the groups, like, architects and engineers, all the celebrities, and just get everybody together and just bring this to the public already.
[02:38:26.482 --> 02:38:26.822]  I mean, it's...
[02:38:27.797 --> 02:38:36.306]  Well, trying to get celebrities, I mean, if a celebrity's at an event or a benefit and somebody walks over and says, what do you think about 9-11?
[02:38:36.306 --> 02:38:37.747]  They'll say inside job.
[02:38:37.747 --> 02:38:44.894]  But once you call them to really go out on this show or really get together for a big stand, then their managers and others start threatening them.
[02:38:45.675 --> 02:38:47.716]  The media took the bait with Charlie Sheen.
[02:38:47.716 --> 02:38:48.576]  He knew this would happen.
[02:38:48.576 --> 02:38:53.737]  He knew because of all his past, they would end up attacking him, but then that would bring the issues up.
[02:38:53.737 --> 02:39:02.560]  So Charlie Sheen was perfect because that's one of the few celebrities they would actually cover because they thought they could discredit it because of some of his past.
[02:39:02.560 --> 02:39:05.240]  It actually blew up in their face.
[02:39:05.240 --> 02:39:07.301]  But, I mean, again, I'm just trying to organize
[02:39:08.351 --> 02:39:11.533]  Building my new studio, making films.
[02:39:11.533 --> 02:39:14.014]  I have limited staff, limited funds.
[02:39:14.014 --> 02:39:17.476]  You know, I had to pull people off key projects just to send them down to the Capitol.
[02:39:17.476 --> 02:39:22.318]  We don't, you know, we can't just spontaneously create like God can.
[02:39:22.318 --> 02:39:26.761]  You know, we're not just here just doing things and making things, but I appreciate your call.
[02:39:26.761 --> 02:39:29.202]  We do what we can, Rob, and I appreciate it.
[02:39:29.202 --> 02:39:30.823]  Let's talk to Joe in Texas.
[02:39:30.823 --> 02:39:32.624]  Joe, you're on the air.
[02:39:32.624 --> 02:39:33.724]  Hey, hi, Alex.
[02:39:33.724 --> 02:39:34.685]  How are you, sir?
[02:39:34.685 --> 02:39:35.045]  Pretty good.
[02:39:36.059 --> 02:39:43.902]  Alex, I was calling about, I was around Austin, just a kid, when they had the tower shootings there.
[02:39:43.902 --> 02:39:52.265]  My stepdad was with the Air Force, and I remember that distinctly, and it's just coincidental about the gun show.
[02:39:52.265 --> 02:40:05.190]  And then I also wanted to tell you, you can check on, if you check, I think it was Wednesday night or Tuesday night of this week, our local news, San Antonio, had a radio guy's house, the guy had
[02:40:06.145 --> 02:40:06.585]  I don't think so.
[02:40:36.607 --> 02:40:38.829]  No, they don't have Art Acevedo, I guess.
[02:40:38.829 --> 02:40:41.651]  He hasn't spoken out against it, so I guess he's for it.
[02:40:41.651 --> 02:40:45.693]  They don't have a police chief that just says, I don't care if it's not a law.
[02:40:45.693 --> 02:40:49.436]  You know, we're going to tell the landlord not to do this and shut it down.
[02:40:49.436 --> 02:40:53.939]  They already ran off the old person that had been there for close to 20 years, Saxit.
[02:40:53.939 --> 02:40:57.461]  But as far as I know, Saxit and others are still having their shows in San Antonio.
[02:40:57.461 --> 02:41:03.365]  I actually looked that up in the last few days, but I appreciate your call, sir.
[02:41:05.427 --> 02:41:12.949]  I don't remember the exact day I did it, but when Aaron Dykes gets back, I sent him down with a camera to the Capitol.
[02:41:12.949 --> 02:41:15.430]  It was the day he wrote the article.
[02:41:15.430 --> 02:41:16.650]  In fact, guys, pull it up.
[02:41:16.650 --> 02:41:18.651]  That's how I can find the date.
[02:41:18.651 --> 02:41:19.911]  I forget the exact headline.
[02:41:19.911 --> 02:41:26.513]  FBI informant planned to attack Firebomb Brave New Books, I think.
[02:41:26.513 --> 02:41:29.193]  Brave New Books, bookstore that sells my books and videos.
[02:41:29.193 --> 02:41:30.594]  One of my fans set it up.
[02:41:30.594 --> 02:41:33.215]  They have speakers all the time that speak there.
[02:41:33.215 --> 02:41:34.175]  It's very successful.
[02:41:35.240 --> 02:41:43.167]  And this guy who was a federal informant, he was buddies... It was December 8th.
[02:41:43.167 --> 02:41:46.170]  He was buddies... Print me the article then, thanks.
[02:41:46.170 --> 02:41:55.458]  He was buddies with the Palestinian that committed suicide by slitting his throat, gutting himself, tying his hands and feet, and throwing himself in the river.
[02:41:55.458 --> 02:41:56.599]  They said that was a suicide.
[02:41:56.599 --> 02:41:57.640]  APD.
[02:41:57.640 --> 02:41:59.182]  That gives you an idea of our police here now.
[02:42:00.328 --> 02:42:02.149]  And he was hanging out with him.
[02:42:02.149 --> 02:42:10.612]  He tried to get activists, according to their reports, and he now admits he was FBI, to firebomb Brave New Books.
[02:42:10.612 --> 02:42:15.394]  This is right at the time that there was the firebombing of the Capitol.
[02:42:15.394 --> 02:42:17.335]  I mean, of the governor's mansion by the Capitol.
[02:42:18.004 --> 02:42:23.686]  And it was on December 8th and December 9th, both those days, I said on air.
[02:42:23.686 --> 02:42:24.727]  So go to the archives, folks.
[02:42:24.727 --> 02:42:25.407]  I don't have the staff.
[02:42:25.407 --> 02:42:26.247]  Pull it for yourself.
[02:42:26.247 --> 02:42:26.768]  Put it on YouTube.
[02:42:26.768 --> 02:42:27.768]  We'll post it.
[02:42:27.768 --> 02:42:29.309]  Where I said, they're getting ready.
[02:42:29.309 --> 02:42:31.410]  I don't know how I always know this.
[02:42:31.410 --> 02:42:33.831]  I don't throw out a lot of predictions.
[02:42:33.831 --> 02:42:36.232]  Maybe one a month or something.
[02:42:36.232 --> 02:42:38.513]  They're going to stage some big flu hype in January.
[02:42:38.513 --> 02:42:40.213]  I can see them getting ready.
[02:42:40.213 --> 02:42:42.614]  They're going to attack the Capitol or something.
[02:42:42.614 --> 02:42:44.555]  Here in Texas, they're going to try to set us up.
[02:42:47.654 --> 02:42:49.075]  It's not even like I'm psychic.
[02:42:49.075 --> 02:42:58.984]  It's like I just can tell from their operations and I study them as like a lay criminologist so much that I know what they're gonna do.
[02:42:58.984 --> 02:43:00.165]  And I got a bad feeling.
[02:43:00.165 --> 02:43:02.687]  I got a really, really, really, really, really, really bad feeling.
[02:43:02.687 --> 02:43:03.748]  Here's the article.
[02:43:03.748 --> 02:43:14.438]  FBI informant who stung RNC 2008 anarchist connected to firebomb plot on Brave New Books and suicided Palestinian activist Raed Hamad.
[02:43:16.189 --> 02:43:26.216]  And it was when this article came out, give me a document cam shot on that, thank you, for PrisonPlanet.tv viewers, it was when all this came out that
[02:43:28.442 --> 02:43:33.588]  The pieces came together and I just... There was some other stuff happened behind the scenes too.
[02:43:33.588 --> 02:43:37.873]  We had people showing up at the office going, I work at the Governor's Mansion.
[02:43:37.873 --> 02:43:39.234]  I work at the Capitol.
[02:43:39.234 --> 02:43:40.736]  They're gonna think it's me.
[02:43:40.736 --> 02:43:43.219]  I want to leave you with this big box of stuff.
[02:43:43.219 --> 02:43:47.584]  And then my guys walked out and looked and they were off-duty... I mean...
[02:43:48.949 --> 02:43:59.735]  Uh, unmarked police cars and people walking around like it was some big bus like they wanted to get him in my office with this box and they called me because I was gone.
[02:43:59.735 --> 02:44:00.795]  No, it was when I was on the radio.
[02:44:03.732 --> 02:44:08.074]  Then when I ran out of the radio, this is at our old office, they said, did we do the right thing?
[02:44:08.074 --> 02:44:10.435]  And I said, hell yeah, you did the right thing.
[02:44:10.435 --> 02:44:11.596]  Do not take anything.
[02:44:11.596 --> 02:44:18.039]  It was a big box, and they were smart enough to walk out front and see the cops, and it was going to be on the news.
[02:44:18.039 --> 02:44:19.560]  Alex Jones, he did it!
[02:44:19.560 --> 02:44:24.082]  You know, I mean, but luckily we have a containment operation to keep these infiltrators out.
[02:44:24.642 --> 02:44:25.882]  They're constantly trying to get in.
[02:44:25.882 --> 02:44:27.483]  We had to move just because of it.
[02:44:27.483 --> 02:44:29.243]  No one is allowed at this office.
[02:44:29.243 --> 02:44:31.444]  Never, if you know our address, come to our door.
[02:44:31.444 --> 02:44:32.884]  You will be screamed at.
[02:44:32.884 --> 02:44:36.265]  Not because you're bad, but because you could be an operative.
[02:44:36.265 --> 02:44:41.486]  I mean, folks, I live in a James Bond situation and I'm not James Bond.
[02:44:41.486 --> 02:44:50.228]  Okay?
[02:44:50.228 --> 02:44:50.408]  So,
[02:44:52.008 --> 02:44:53.349]  We have that going on.
[02:44:53.349 --> 02:44:59.811]  We talked to Lisa Blount, the spokeswoman for the Capitol State Police.
[02:44:59.811 --> 02:45:01.272]  It's a separate special unit.
[02:45:01.272 --> 02:45:03.053]  Pretty nice guys.
[02:45:03.053 --> 02:45:04.934]  Most of them are listeners to the show when I'm down there.
[02:45:04.934 --> 02:45:06.114]  They tell me about the show.
[02:45:06.114 --> 02:45:08.795]  But a 24-year-old male from Houston.
[02:45:08.795 --> 02:45:11.536]  We need to get this out because this is not yet in the other news.
[02:45:11.536 --> 02:45:13.097]  This is breaking.
[02:45:13.097 --> 02:45:14.518]  We just got this from her three minutes ago.
[02:45:14.518 --> 02:45:19.440]  24-year-old male from Houston fired several shots on the south steps of the Capitol.
[02:45:20.430 --> 02:45:23.691]  No reported injuries, including the gunman.
[02:45:23.691 --> 02:45:27.213]  She would not say, she said she did not know what direction he shot.
[02:45:27.213 --> 02:45:28.554]  Did he fire in the air?
[02:45:28.554 --> 02:45:29.954]  Did he fire down Congress Avenue?
[02:45:29.954 --> 02:45:32.895]  Did he fire into the granite steps?
[02:45:32.895 --> 02:45:35.597]  Was it blanks?
[02:45:35.597 --> 02:45:47.882]  Is this some... Folks, if they... If it turns out this guy's ever been in psychiatric care of the government, or was in the army, that's where they do the brainwashing, or was protected and already made threats, or
[02:45:49.534 --> 02:45:53.775]  They can also threaten your family to get you to do this.
[02:45:53.775 --> 02:45:59.136]  There's an intelligence operation we've proven going on down there to provocateur.
[02:45:59.136 --> 02:46:09.339]  Now, I don't know if this is a nut or not, but I'm telling you, I predicted a staged attack on the governor's mansion or Capitol.
[02:46:09.339 --> 02:46:10.599]  I remember that from memory.
[02:46:10.599 --> 02:46:11.899]  I don't know how I do it.
[02:46:21.018 --> 02:46:24.040]  And there's nothing really, there's nothing really new here.
[02:46:24.040 --> 02:46:28.143]  Again, Texas State Capitol, shots fired, at least four shots.
[02:46:28.143 --> 02:46:30.925]  Jaren?
[02:46:30.925 --> 02:46:32.867]  Oh, you need this here?
[02:46:32.867 --> 02:46:33.607]  You bet.
[02:46:33.607 --> 02:46:35.609]  Awesome, yeah, give it to Kurt Nemo.
[02:46:35.609 --> 02:46:38.110]  Thank you.
[02:46:38.110 --> 02:46:43.434]  DPS shots fired at State Capitol, Austin Chronicle, Houston Chronicle, excuse me.
[02:46:43.434 --> 02:46:49.879]  Jim Magid, visiting from New York, said he was inside the building on the first floor and people started rushing to the south entrance.
[02:46:50.930 --> 02:46:53.191]  Prompted by a reaction of two troopers.
[02:46:53.191 --> 02:46:57.313]  He said the man next to her said he heard four or five pops.
[02:46:57.313 --> 02:47:07.779]  When Magid, or however you pronounce his name, got outside, she saw about 25 officers surrounding a man lying on the ground on his side in a fetal position.
[02:47:07.779 --> 02:47:08.740]  His officers held him down.
[02:47:09.676 --> 02:47:10.837]  He was not resisting arrest.
[02:47:10.837 --> 02:47:16.359]  She said she heard one of the troopers say there might be another person on the building's third floor.
[02:47:16.359 --> 02:47:18.461]  Folks, this sounds completely staged.
[02:47:18.461 --> 02:47:22.643]  This guy's got a gun and he's shooting it and they didn't shoot him?
[02:47:22.643 --> 02:47:27.365]  You come in my office or my area and you're shooting a gun?
[02:47:27.365 --> 02:47:31.447]  You are deader than a doornail.
[02:47:31.447 --> 02:47:33.248]  And that's how the police are trained.
[02:47:33.248 --> 02:47:34.509]  They should have killed this guy.
[02:47:36.052 --> 02:47:42.133]  But if he shot the shots, laid the gun down, he's either a lunatic looking for attention or this was staged.
[02:47:42.133 --> 02:47:46.314]  And more and more, this is looking staged.
[02:47:46.314 --> 02:47:47.934]  I don't know if it was staged.
[02:47:47.934 --> 02:47:55.536]  We'll certainly learn more as this unfolds.
[02:47:55.536 --> 02:47:55.996]  I don't know.
[02:47:55.996 --> 02:48:05.658]  A witness told Statesman that six shots were fired in rapid succession, that's Fox News, were heard at noon.
[02:48:10.225 --> 02:48:13.806]  State employees are standing on the grounds as authorities secure the Capitol building.
[02:48:13.806 --> 02:48:15.747]  Authorities.
[02:48:15.747 --> 02:48:18.608]  Thought they were peace officers.
[02:48:18.608 --> 02:48:22.389]  Man, I don't know what to say about this, I'll tell you.
[02:48:22.389 --> 02:48:24.330]  Joe in Texas, you're on the air, go ahead.
[02:48:24.330 --> 02:48:28.931]  Hey!
[02:48:28.931 --> 02:48:30.052]  Okay, I'm out of control.
[02:48:30.052 --> 02:48:33.013]  Larry in Texas, go ahead, Larry.
[02:48:33.013 --> 02:48:33.993]  Hello, Alex.
[02:48:33.993 --> 02:48:35.253]  Hey, buddy.
[02:48:35.253 --> 02:48:39.235]  Hey, I got some ballistic information that might save somebody's life if...
[02:48:39.983 --> 02:48:42.644]  If they own a 223.
[02:48:42.644 --> 02:48:57.030]  Back in 82 I was at the Sheriff's Office waiting to go on patrol and I was filming through a law magazine and the article was about the ineffectiveness of the M16 at a roadblock.
[02:48:57.030 --> 02:49:04.654]  So my partner was expecting his new delivery of a M16, a semi-automatic version.
[02:49:04.654 --> 02:49:09.356]  And I finished the article, I passed it across the desk and said, hey, you might want to get your money back after you read this.
[02:49:09.878 --> 02:49:13.541]  So he read it and said, ah, nothing about that.
[02:49:13.541 --> 02:49:16.503]  So I, uh, anticipated, uh, this.
[02:49:16.503 --> 02:49:20.927]  So I contacted a tow driver, asked him if he had a vehicle he could sacrifice.
[02:49:20.927 --> 02:49:31.956]  So, uh, he got his new gun in and we went out there and, uh, he had a clip of a full metal jacket and a clip of hollow point.
[02:49:31.956 --> 02:49:36.660]  And the three tests that we'd done, according to article was put a cardboard target behind the steering wheel.
[02:49:37.389 --> 02:49:40.450]  Stand 10 steps in front of the vehicle and open up on it.
[02:49:40.450 --> 02:49:44.551]  So, uh, he raised up, cut loose with five rounds.
[02:49:44.551 --> 02:49:46.632]  We went up and looked.
[02:49:46.632 --> 02:49:52.454]  And all it does is just, you could do more damage with a daisy red rider, just chips of windshield.
[02:49:52.454 --> 02:49:55.294]  So he tried it with the hollow points, same results.
[02:49:55.294 --> 02:49:59.296]  Second test was, uh, shooting through the side door.
[02:49:59.296 --> 02:50:04.937]  Um, put the target there sideways, uh, between the seat and the door panel.
[02:50:04.937 --> 02:50:07.078]  And it punches really nice holes in the side door.
[02:50:08.237 --> 02:50:15.740]  But the shrapnel that came out the other side was like taking a piece of rice and cutting it lengthwise in about four or five pieces.
[02:50:22.671 --> 02:50:28.833]  30-odd 6, 308, 30-30 would shoot right through the washing machine, all four layers.
[02:50:28.833 --> 02:50:32.634]  The outer layer, the inner layer, the next inner layer, and the outer layer.
[02:50:32.634 --> 02:50:42.916]  And most of the .223s wouldn't even make it all the way through, but if they did, it was just a little bit of shrapnel, because the bullet turns, it's very small, it's a .22 caliber, as you know.
[02:50:45.057 --> 02:50:48.782]  That's why I can shoot .222 or .223 through that.
[02:50:48.782 --> 02:50:52.507]  And, uh, it is really not a very good round.
[02:50:52.507 --> 02:50:53.688]  Unless it hits flesh.
[02:50:53.688 --> 02:50:56.272]  It's very devastating when it actually hits flesh.
[02:50:56.272 --> 02:50:57.854]  Stay there, we'll come back and see where we're going with this.
[02:51:01.400 --> 02:51:04.941]  Hounded by debt collectors with phone calls and letters?
[02:51:04.941 --> 02:51:07.242]  Thinking of calling a debt relief company?
[02:51:07.242 --> 02:51:08.102]  Don't!
[02:51:08.102 --> 02:51:11.544]  Greedy lawyers and debt companies charge thousands.

[02:51:49.201 --> 02:51:53.022]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[02:51:53.022 --> 02:51:55.183]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[02:51:55.183 --> 02:51:57.463]  As we're finishing off this agenda
[02:52:11.972 --> 02:52:14.655]  They'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[02:52:14.655 --> 02:52:21.040]  I have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[02:52:21.040 --> 02:52:26.225]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[02:52:26.225 --> 02:52:36.214]  For the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation, the criminal offshore cartel, hell-bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government.
[02:52:36.334 --> 02:52:38.675]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists!
[02:52:38.675 --> 02:52:40.276]  They're asking for more matches!
[02:52:40.276 --> 02:52:42.717]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[02:52:42.717 --> 02:52:44.578]  Today seems like nobody does care.
[02:52:44.578 --> 02:52:50.001]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic.

[02:54:18.954 --> 02:54:24.338]  The Atlanta Journal-Constitution talked to witnesses.
[02:54:24.338 --> 02:54:31.383]  Republican Senator Dan Patrick wrote on his Twitter page that he wasn't in the office but his staff called security and told him this.
[02:54:31.383 --> 02:54:35.687]  An individual came into my Austin Senate office today acting strangely.
[02:54:37.208 --> 02:54:39.409]  Staff called security moments later.
[02:54:39.409 --> 02:54:42.390]  Shots fired on Capitol Steps, he wrote.
[02:54:42.390 --> 02:54:46.212]  So it looks like he came in, something happened, he ran out.
[02:54:46.212 --> 02:54:50.214]  Maybe he didn't want the police to arrest him and he shot it at the ground or something.
[02:54:50.214 --> 02:54:52.495]  We're only speculating.
[02:54:52.495 --> 02:54:54.376]  Why didn't they kill him?
[02:54:54.376 --> 02:54:58.838]  Somebody comes around my office and starts shooting a gun, trying to hurt people.
[02:54:58.838 --> 02:55:00.459]  I'm not gonna talk to him.
[02:55:00.459 --> 02:55:02.280]  I'm gonna kill him.
[02:55:02.280 --> 02:55:04.240]  I mean, I would expect the police to draw down and shoot him.
[02:55:04.240 --> 02:55:05.061]  Don't talk to him.
[02:55:08.103 --> 02:55:12.245]  See, people always defend police when they shoot somebody who's unarmed in the back.
[02:55:12.245 --> 02:55:16.486]  But then they get on police if they shoot somebody who's already got a gun.
[02:55:16.486 --> 02:55:18.147]  Look, you got a gun and you're already shooting it?
[02:55:18.147 --> 02:55:19.387]  I don't think anybody should wait.
[02:55:19.387 --> 02:55:22.608]  You just need to shoot.
[02:55:22.608 --> 02:55:27.450]  You know, I always see these cases where somebody breaks into business and the person says, hands up.
[02:55:27.450 --> 02:55:29.811]  I'm not going to say hands up if you've broken in.
[02:55:29.811 --> 02:55:32.472]  I'm just going to shoot you.
[02:55:32.472 --> 02:55:33.853]  And that's what the law says I should do.
[02:55:38.996 --> 02:55:39.977]  It goes on from there.
[02:55:39.977 --> 02:55:42.219]  This is terrible.
[02:55:42.219 --> 02:55:49.625]  Going back to Larry in Texas, as he's a sheriff's deputy, warning people about how ineffective 223 is.
[02:55:49.625 --> 02:55:56.450]  It's fired from the M16, AR-15, Ruger range rifles, the list goes on and on.
[02:55:56.450 --> 02:55:59.173]  But separately from that, I've tested it myself, I know you're right.
[02:56:00.103 --> 02:56:01.484]  Uh, people do need a heavier round.
[02:56:01.484 --> 02:56:02.725]  Why does our military use the .223?
[02:56:02.725 --> 02:56:09.690]  Uh, because they did studies with the Colt, the original M16, and found that when it hits, it changes directions.
[02:56:09.690 --> 02:56:17.675]  I've shot deer with a .223, and as long as you shoot them a hundred yards or closer, the bullet doesn't even generally come out, but it goes all over.
[02:56:17.675 --> 02:56:27.601]  I don't like it because it messes up a lot of meat, but I've shot deer with .223s and they always drop immediately, whereas I shoot them with a .30-06 or .308, they tend to run 10-15 feet.
[02:56:27.601 --> 02:56:29.523]  They got a big hole blown in them on the other side.
[02:56:30.543 --> 02:56:31.264]  It sounds suspicious.
[02:57:01.467 --> 02:57:04.649]  I couldn't answer that.
[02:57:04.649 --> 02:57:06.530]  Too bad they didn't take them out.
[02:57:06.530 --> 02:57:09.031]  But doesn't it sound suspicious that they wouldn't?
[02:57:09.031 --> 02:57:12.652]  I mean normal procedure of somebody shooting a gun is you shoot them.
[02:57:12.652 --> 02:57:16.394]  Oh yeah, neutralize.
[02:57:16.394 --> 02:57:28.320]  Back to the last test we done with the 223 was if someone was in the brush and you were returning fire at someone hiding in the brush and we set the target behind the waist high brush and
[02:57:28.928 --> 02:57:35.531]  Left the head portion showing where you could gauge 12 inches blow and then be able to shoot.
[02:57:35.531 --> 02:57:47.436]  None of the rounds made it through the brush, so if someone's in the weeds with the ghillie suit on shooting at you, you're going to have a hard time trying to return with the .223.
[02:57:47.436 --> 02:57:50.118]  One other thing I want to pass on to you about RFID.
[02:57:50.118 --> 02:57:57.121]  I was listening to a computer show, a guy that helps you with your computer, and someone called in about the RFID.
[02:57:58.473 --> 02:58:18.626]  And he said that there's a YouTube, I don't have a computer, he said there's a YouTube video that shows a situation where these new passports had RFID chip in them and they're coded by... Yeah, and the guy drives around San Francisco stealing people's passports.
[02:58:18.626 --> 02:58:27.752]  This was a garbage can that had a bomb in it and numerous people were walking by it, but as soon as an American went by it, it blowed up.
[02:58:29.252 --> 02:58:30.193]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[02:58:30.193 --> 02:58:31.334]  Be sure to visit GCNlive.com today.
[02:58:52.409 --> 02:58:56.430]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[02:58:56.430 --> 02:58:59.671]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[02:58:59.671 --> 02:59:04.472]  As they're finishing off this agenda, they'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[02:59:04.472 --> 02:59:10.854]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[02:59:10.854 --> 02:59:13.095]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us
[02:59:13.635 --> 02:59:13.935]  Tim Geithner?
[02:59:13.935 --> 02:59:14.435]  Bernanke?
[02:59:14.435 --> 02:59:15.056]  They're arsonists!
[02:59:15.056 --> 02:59:15.776]  They're asking for more matches!
[02:59:15.776 --> 02:59:17.897]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[02:59:32.543 --> 02:59:34.664]  Today seems like nobody does care.
[02:59:34.664 --> 02:59:39.805]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the republic.
[02:59:39.805 --> 02:59:54.349]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[02:59:54.349 --> 02:59:56.730]  Waging war on corruption.
[02:59:56.730 --> 02:59:59.511]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[03:00:17.346 --> 03:00:28.311]  We've got photos taken from on top of an office building across the street as the reported alleged shooter was apprehended by police.
[03:00:28.311 --> 03:00:30.112]  I find it very suspicious.
[03:00:30.112 --> 03:00:32.993]  In fact, where's my fact sheet?
[03:00:32.993 --> 03:00:34.234]  It's 24 year old, right?
[03:00:34.234 --> 03:00:36.535]  Can I have that?
[03:00:36.535 --> 03:00:38.016]  Yeah, 24 year old male from Houston.
[03:00:40.191 --> 03:00:42.092]  We called the state police and got this information.
[03:00:42.092 --> 03:00:43.953]  This isn't even out in the media yet.
[03:00:43.953 --> 03:00:48.015]  This is from the spokeswoman, Lisa Block.
[03:00:48.015 --> 03:00:58.840]  I mean, I find it very suspicious that you've got a guy on the steps of the Capitol, crawling with armed state police, waving a gun around, shooting it, and they didn't shoot him.
[03:00:58.840 --> 03:01:04.823]  And that, I guess they then said, freeze while he's shooting a gun, and then he put it down and they didn't shoot him?
[03:01:09.502 --> 03:01:12.084]  I mean, the cops half the time go and shoot homeowners.
[03:01:12.084 --> 03:01:16.267]  They're so trigger happy when they're investigating something.
[03:01:16.267 --> 03:01:20.390]  And I mean, I'm not saying they're bad when they do that, but there's a lot of accidents that happen.
[03:01:20.390 --> 03:01:33.780]  I know the DPS is supposedly better trained than a lot of police departments, but I don't understand how somebody is running around shooting five to six shots, they're now saying, and no one shoots him.
[03:01:33.780 --> 03:01:37.903]  The scenario I start thinking about now, according to the state senator who said he was in his office,
[03:01:39.537 --> 03:01:41.879]  He was acting strangely left and then they heard shots.
[03:01:41.879 --> 03:01:44.641]  So he's acting strangely.
[03:01:44.641 --> 03:01:46.602]  Maybe he had a concealed carry.
[03:01:46.602 --> 03:01:48.564]  You're not supposed to have that in the Capitol.
[03:01:48.564 --> 03:01:50.125]  They start grabbing on him.
[03:01:50.125 --> 03:01:52.006]  It looks like a Glock.
[03:01:52.006 --> 03:01:58.651]  There's an image of the state police and the state police wouldn't hold their own firearm, plus it's not what the state police carry.
[03:01:58.651 --> 03:02:05.216]  It looks like a small Glock or one of the knockoffs of the plastic gun.
[03:02:05.216 --> 03:02:07.378]  You know, the Capitol doesn't have metal detectors in it.
[03:02:08.120 --> 03:02:10.284]  You know they're just going to stick them in there as if that'll do anything.
[03:02:10.284 --> 03:02:16.676]  I bet they're going to put naked body scanners in there and I bet this whole thing is a DPS intelligence operation, but I don't know that.
[03:02:18.490 --> 03:02:25.853]  But DPS was marked as the worst in the country under COINTELPRO, staging fake terror attacks and keeping lists on citizens.
[03:02:25.853 --> 03:02:27.054]  And they still do it.
[03:02:27.054 --> 03:02:29.395]  But that came out in the 80s and they got barred from it.
[03:02:29.395 --> 03:02:34.077]  Blow up that photo for PrisonPlanet.tv viewers and send these photos over to Curt Nemo.
[03:02:34.077 --> 03:02:37.638]  Now that's the shot, a better face shot of the alleged perpetrator.
[03:02:37.638 --> 03:02:42.080]  Let's blow that up first.
[03:02:42.080 --> 03:02:43.921]  And then the other photo is
[03:02:44.924 --> 03:02:46.245]  of the gun.
[03:02:46.245 --> 03:02:46.925]  Blow it up some more.
[03:02:46.925 --> 03:02:51.647]  Let's blow it right up to his face so everybody can see it.
[03:02:51.647 --> 03:02:56.208]  Where did you guys get these so people can go look at them for themselves?
[03:02:56.208 --> 03:02:57.209]  This is KXAN.
[03:02:57.209 --> 03:02:58.709]  Blow it up some more.
[03:02:58.709 --> 03:03:01.370]  KXAN.com.
[03:03:01.370 --> 03:03:05.212]  Yep, that looks like a white male.
[03:03:05.212 --> 03:03:10.094]  Crew cut, haircut, white t-shirt, blue jeans.
[03:03:10.094 --> 03:03:11.914]  You got DPS there with a bike cop.
[03:03:11.914 --> 03:03:13.115]  Okay, go to the other photo.
[03:03:13.769 --> 03:03:14.830]  Now, blow that up.
[03:03:14.830 --> 03:03:16.411]  Look at that firearm.
[03:03:16.411 --> 03:03:18.693]  That is a Glock.
[03:03:18.693 --> 03:03:21.815]  Or one of the similar, there's so many now that imitate the Glock.
[03:03:21.815 --> 03:03:34.504]  That is one of the smaller little snub-nosed, semi-automatic, black, composite, call them plastic, they're really composite firearms.
[03:03:34.504 --> 03:03:35.625]  That's what that is.
[03:03:35.625 --> 03:03:39.368]  And it looks like the chamber is open.
[03:03:39.368 --> 03:03:41.670]  So the slide, the top of the firearm,
[03:03:42.762 --> 03:03:44.023]  Let's go back to that.
[03:03:44.023 --> 03:03:44.543]  It's open.
[03:03:44.543 --> 03:03:47.424]  See how it's sticking out further past the handle?
[03:03:47.424 --> 03:03:50.886]  And the police officer is holding it by the barrel.
[03:03:50.886 --> 03:03:52.667]  That's not how he would hold his own firearm.
[03:03:52.667 --> 03:03:54.628]  It'd be in his hand.
[03:03:54.628 --> 03:04:00.651]  And I believe he does have a... He does have a... Yeah, he's got a shotgun in his right hand.
[03:04:00.651 --> 03:04:04.874]  A black semi-auto shotgun.
[03:04:05.879 --> 03:04:14.669]  He's got a riot shotgun in one hand, and I'll guarantee you that officer's not going to be holding a firearm that way, unless he had just grabbed it up off the ground.
[03:04:14.669 --> 03:04:17.573]  And these photos, they report, were just seconds after they apprehended him.
[03:04:21.701 --> 03:04:28.845]  Did he fire the shots to scare people and then put it back in his belt buckle and then run?
[03:04:28.845 --> 03:04:35.149]  That's the only way they wouldn't have killed him if it isn't, or at least shot him, if this wasn't staged.
[03:04:35.149 --> 03:04:38.350]  See, we're trying to work the different angles of this.
[03:04:38.350 --> 03:04:39.631]  Could it be suspicious?
[03:04:39.631 --> 03:04:40.612]  Yes.
[03:04:40.612 --> 03:04:42.273]  Or could it be just a lunatic?
[03:04:42.273 --> 03:04:43.653]  Yes.
[03:04:43.653 --> 03:04:45.254]  But I'll guarantee you this.
[03:04:45.254 --> 03:04:48.116]  There aren't any police on the planet where somebody's on the steps of the Capitol
[03:04:49.755 --> 03:04:54.236]  With a gun firing shots, they're not going to sit there and say, drop the gun, drop the gun.
[03:04:54.236 --> 03:04:59.738]  They're going to shoot him.
[03:04:59.738 --> 03:05:01.379]  We'll be right back.
[03:05:01.379 --> 03:05:06.720]  One major world crisis away from having a totalitarian type of system.
[03:05:06.720 --> 03:05:09.481]  The main event is the wholesale destruction of the world economy.
[03:05:09.481 --> 03:05:14.803]  The push for every nation on the globe to identify and number all of its citizens.
[03:05:14.803 --> 03:05:16.203]  Friends, I hope that you will order

[03:06:01.889 --> 03:06:04.910]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[03:06:04.910 --> 03:06:10.231]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[03:06:10.231 --> 03:06:12.292]  My answer would be all I can get.
[03:06:12.292 --> 03:06:17.294]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[03:06:17.294 --> 03:06:18.474]  How much do you want?
[03:06:18.474 --> 03:06:19.594]  When do you want it?
[03:06:19.594 --> 03:06:21.475]  Now or after the battle starts?
[03:06:21.475 --> 03:06:22.555]  When will you need it?
[03:06:22.555 --> 03:06:24.756]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[03:06:24.756 --> 03:06:26.096]  Will there be any food?
[03:06:26.096 --> 03:06:27.617]  Will it make your children sick?
[03:06:27.617 --> 03:06:28.637]  If there's a quarantine,
[03:06:28.837 --> 03:06:29.237]  I'm Alex Jones.
[03:06:45.530 --> 03:06:48.593]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.
[03:06:48.593 --> 03:06:50.694]  Call 1-800-409-5633.
[03:06:50.694 --> 03:06:56.119]  Or check it out on the web at efoodsdirect.com.
[03:06:56.119 --> 03:06:58.641]  Again, that number, 1-800-409-5633.
[03:06:58.641 --> 03:07:06.347]  Well, we are opposed around the world by a monolithic and ruthless conspiracy.
[03:07:06.347 --> 03:07:08.849]  The JFK assassination.
[03:07:08.849 --> 03:07:09.469]  This is Houston.
[03:07:09.469 --> 03:07:11.211]  Say again, please.
[03:07:11.211 --> 03:07:12.792]  Houston, we've had a problem.
[03:07:12.792 --> 03:07:13.813]  Landing on the moon.
[03:07:14.858 --> 03:07:22.042]  The pictures of airplanes flying into buildings, fires burning, huge structures collapsing, have filled us with disbelief.
[03:07:22.042 --> 03:07:24.023]  9-11.
[03:07:24.023 --> 03:07:26.645]  I know that many of my supporters are disappointed.
[03:07:26.645 --> 03:07:27.605]  I am too.
[03:07:27.605 --> 03:07:30.187]  Global warming.
[03:07:30.187 --> 03:07:32.228]  Historic events.
[03:07:32.228 --> 03:07:33.229]  Or conspiracies.

[03:07:52.973 --> 03:07:53.793]  Exposing tyranny since 1991.
[03:08:02.529 --> 03:08:05.290]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[03:08:05.290 --> 03:08:08.191]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[03:08:08.191 --> 03:08:15.673]  Alright, let's go through these calls that are up on the board right now and then I'm going to get to all the other news we haven't covered yet.
[03:08:15.673 --> 03:08:17.134]  I'm believing there's a lot of it.
[03:08:17.134 --> 03:08:20.035]  Tessa in Texas, you're on the air, welcome.
[03:08:20.035 --> 03:08:21.555]  Hey Alex, how you doing today?
[03:08:21.555 --> 03:08:22.896]  I guess okay.
[03:08:22.896 --> 03:08:28.658]  Oh man, I tell you, this is scary.
[03:08:28.658 --> 03:08:28.978]  Welcome.
[03:08:29.502 --> 03:08:30.502]  Yes, thank you.
[03:08:30.502 --> 03:08:33.963]  Yeah, it's scary what's going on at the Capitol right now.
[03:08:33.963 --> 03:08:35.543]  Oh, it certainly is.
[03:08:35.543 --> 03:08:36.384]  It certainly is.
[03:08:36.384 --> 03:08:38.084]  I mean, it is.
[03:08:38.084 --> 03:08:39.705]  What do you think of what's happening?
[03:08:39.705 --> 03:08:44.666]  Talk about something else that went down at the Capitol on January 16th.
[03:08:44.666 --> 03:08:48.907]  The nullification rally and the events that ensued after that.
[03:08:48.907 --> 03:08:51.547]  Which I caught on film and it's up on my YouTube channel.
[03:08:51.547 --> 03:08:52.888]  Tell folks about the rally.
[03:08:52.888 --> 03:08:53.988]  Tell them what happened.
[03:08:53.988 --> 03:08:57.609]  Okay, well, I had come there just to support nullification.
[03:08:58.459 --> 03:09:03.342]  And I had no idea that there would be so many Debra Medina supporters there.
[03:09:03.342 --> 03:09:06.524]  I mean, it made up basically the entire crowd.
[03:09:06.524 --> 03:09:13.027]  And, supposedly, they were under the impression that she was going to speak that day.
[03:09:13.027 --> 03:09:18.551]  And near the end of the rally, the crowd started getting a little bit boisterous about it, and were saying, where's Debra?
[03:09:18.551 --> 03:09:20.512]  Why isn't she allowed to speak?
[03:09:20.512 --> 03:09:22.933]  Well, she never got to get up there and speak.
[03:09:22.933 --> 03:09:24.974]  So, what I filmed was, um,
[03:09:26.494 --> 03:09:27.956]  It was just a slight confrontation.
[03:09:27.956 --> 03:09:36.648]  It was really more of a discussion, but it was kind of a, you know, just an argument between one of the Medina supporters wondering why she wasn't allowed to speak...
[03:09:37.640 --> 03:09:43.727]  And then, uh, one of the people that was putting the rally on... Well, ma'am, you've got to fill people in.
[03:09:43.727 --> 03:09:48.051]  Deborah Medina is one of the Republican candidates for governor.
[03:09:48.051 --> 03:09:50.374]  She's surging in the polls against Rick Perry.
[03:09:50.374 --> 03:09:54.658]  I mean, she's coming from way behind Rick Perry and Kay Bailey Hutchinson.
[03:09:54.658 --> 03:09:57.321]  Tell people what the nullification rally was for.
[03:09:57.321 --> 03:09:58.082]  You know, let people know.
[03:09:59.181 --> 03:10:03.324]  Yeah, and anyway, so... Nullification of what?
[03:10:03.324 --> 03:10:05.925]  Nullification of the health care bill.
[03:10:05.925 --> 03:10:06.666]  Yes.
[03:10:06.666 --> 03:10:14.951]  But really, I mean, any bill that could come, you know, the Congress passes that... And Deborah Medina was there and wasn't allowed to speak?
[03:10:14.951 --> 03:10:22.636]  She was there, and wasn't on the invited list from all the research that I've been able to do.
[03:10:22.636 --> 03:10:24.717]  I know she wasn't on the list officially,
[03:10:25.987 --> 03:10:32.453]  But what I think was there was a miscommunication between the person that had the permit and then the people that were putting on the rally.
[03:10:32.453 --> 03:10:37.557]  Supposedly, I've got to look up the code.
[03:10:37.557 --> 03:10:38.658]  Well, that's in the past.
[03:10:38.658 --> 03:10:39.679]  We can move forward now.
[03:10:39.679 --> 03:10:41.280]  What else is on your mind?
[03:10:41.280 --> 03:10:42.121]  Sure.
[03:10:42.121 --> 03:10:47.565]  So anyway, you know, basically I just interviewed a lot of people just wondering why she wasn't allowed to speak at the rally.
[03:10:47.565 --> 03:10:50.048]  And the people wanted her and she wasn't allowed to speak.
[03:10:50.048 --> 03:10:51.549]  And so now articles are coming out
[03:10:52.499 --> 03:11:00.485]  There's a blog up on WordPress, and the author is Sybil West, and she's basically saying that Debra Medina supporters are thugs.
[03:11:00.485 --> 03:11:01.946]  I appreciate your call, ma'am.
[03:11:01.946 --> 03:11:03.647]  I appreciate your call.
[03:11:03.647 --> 03:11:08.630]  I mean, look, Debra Medina, every time I turn on the talk radio, they're talking about the governor's race.
[03:11:08.630 --> 03:11:12.773]  Almost everyone calls in supporting her for governor.
[03:11:15.779 --> 03:11:19.821]  You know, getting into little fights with other Republicans and people, it really goes nowhere.
[03:11:19.821 --> 03:11:22.982]  People listening in Japan right now don't really know what we're talking about.
[03:11:22.982 --> 03:11:24.042]  Johnny in Alabama.
[03:11:24.042 --> 03:11:26.383]  Johnny, you're on the air.
[03:11:26.383 --> 03:11:27.384]  Hey, Alex.
[03:11:27.384 --> 03:11:29.745]  I haven't been listening to you very long.
[03:11:29.745 --> 03:11:31.566]  I'm waking up.
[03:11:31.566 --> 03:11:40.089]  Obama's are talking about people getting thinner, talking about fat people, people overweight, kids overweight.
[03:11:40.089 --> 03:11:44.391]  And I wonder if you have any information about the government
[03:11:45.391 --> 03:11:50.995]  Taking human fat and turning it into biodiesel.
[03:11:50.995 --> 03:12:03.804]  No, I know in the movie Fight Club they take human fat and turn it into designer soap because melted down fat from murdered Chinese political dissidents is put into some of the more fancy cosmetics around the world.
[03:12:03.804 --> 03:12:06.826]  But no, I don't know anything about turning human fat into biodiesel, Johnny.
[03:12:06.826 --> 03:12:10.549]  I was just wondering.
[03:12:10.549 --> 03:12:12.971]  I tell you, that's off the wall, Johnny, but I appreciate it.
[03:12:12.971 --> 03:12:14.432]  Very interesting thought there for the day.
[03:12:15.501 --> 03:12:17.042]  Valerie in Oklahoma.
[03:12:17.042 --> 03:12:17.723]  You're on the air.
[03:12:17.723 --> 03:12:20.085]  Go ahead.
[03:12:20.085 --> 03:12:21.045]  Hi, Alex.
[03:12:21.045 --> 03:12:26.549]  I'm in Tulsa, land where the slaves can't be trusted to have their own garden.
[03:12:26.549 --> 03:12:27.070]  That's right.
[03:12:27.070 --> 03:12:29.812]  Your mayor says that's evil.
[03:12:29.812 --> 03:12:32.614]  That's right.
[03:12:32.614 --> 03:12:36.117]  You might grow marijuana, so we need to restrict you being able to have a garden.
[03:12:36.117 --> 03:12:39.699]  You can't let prisoners have their own gardens.
[03:12:39.699 --> 03:12:40.400]  No.
[03:12:40.400 --> 03:12:41.661]  Huh.
[03:12:41.661 --> 03:12:43.122]  Well, the reason for my call today
[03:12:43.740 --> 03:12:57.423]  I wanted to tell you that I listened to a little bit of Glenn Beck this morning, and as if we needed any more proof that he's trying to become you, he said that he's going into the documentary filmmaking business.
[03:12:57.423 --> 03:12:58.683]  You're joking.
[03:12:58.683 --> 03:13:00.164]  No, I'm not.
[03:13:00.164 --> 03:13:05.745]  Second hour, about the first, it was the first half of the second hour.
[03:13:05.745 --> 03:13:09.686]  And he, he didn't really, he said, I can't really say much about it, but it's going to be really big.
[03:13:11.226 --> 03:13:11.967]  Well, good for him.
[03:13:11.967 --> 03:13:25.139]  It'll be in theaters, he'll be bigger than Michael Moore, and it'll be a fake right-wing view of the world like what we have with Michael Moore giving you a left-wing rebel view, and that's just how they operate.
[03:13:25.139 --> 03:13:28.642]  But the truth will continue to smash their propaganda.
[03:13:28.642 --> 03:13:29.303]  Right.
[03:13:29.303 --> 03:13:29.823]  That's right.
[03:13:29.823 --> 03:13:32.085]  I'm so glad that you're gonna go after him.
[03:13:32.085 --> 03:13:33.547]  I agree with you 100%.
[03:13:33.547 --> 03:13:37.070]  I think he is just an absolute... he's just a demon.
[03:13:41.414 --> 03:13:46.638]  Well, every time I tune in, and I didn't do it this morning, I turned it on driving to work and I just, I can't listen.
[03:13:46.638 --> 03:13:51.842]  I had to turn it off because of just how disingenuous and manipulative he is and how obvious it is to me.
[03:13:51.842 --> 03:13:53.844]  It's hard to listen to.
[03:13:53.844 --> 03:13:57.667]  And we'll just see what happens.
[03:13:57.667 --> 03:13:59.728]  But no, left-right paradigm.
[03:13:59.728 --> 03:14:01.170]  I mean, he literally
[03:14:02.622 --> 03:14:17.772]  When I listen, it's like, oh my gosh, he's expropriated so much of what we do, and then always, days after we cover something, he then covers it, but then puts his spin on it, and to watch my work turned into what he's doing with it, but you know what?
[03:14:17.772 --> 03:14:27.719]  In the end, it'll just turn out good, because he will wake up a mainstream audience, they'll then find out what's going on, and they'll find out the full story.
[03:14:27.719 --> 03:14:29.220]  But I appreciate your call.
[03:14:30.060 --> 03:14:32.301]  We're getting a lot of emails like this.
[03:14:32.301 --> 03:14:40.863]  My feeling is that this shooting at the Texas State Building this morning is a direct staged event in response to the closing of the gun show.
[03:14:40.863 --> 03:14:41.963]  You watch.
[03:14:41.963 --> 03:14:44.644]  He will have gotten his weapon at the gun show.
[03:14:44.644 --> 03:14:46.885]  See ya.
[03:14:46.885 --> 03:14:49.625]  We gotta close the gun shows.
[03:14:49.625 --> 03:14:50.986]  Keep them up.
[03:14:50.986 --> 03:14:52.426]  D. Francis.
[03:14:52.426 --> 03:14:56.787]  I don't know.
[03:14:56.787 --> 03:14:59.108]  It may be that he was some concealed carry guy
[03:15:02.540 --> 03:15:05.283]  Who came in and said something threatening at the Senator's office.
[03:15:05.283 --> 03:15:08.226]  They said he was acting strangely.
[03:15:08.226 --> 03:15:11.749]  And then they tried to grab him and it's a semi-auto and it went off or something.
[03:15:11.749 --> 03:15:13.251]  I mean, who knows?
[03:15:13.251 --> 03:15:14.051]  We don't know yet.
[03:15:14.051 --> 03:15:15.473]  We'll find out soon.
[03:15:15.473 --> 03:15:21.779]  We'll have articles at InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com that break that down.
[03:15:21.779 --> 03:15:24.622]  Let's go ahead and talk to Peter in Canada.
[03:15:24.622 --> 03:15:25.403]  Peter, you're on the air.
[03:15:26.618 --> 03:15:28.179]  Hey Alex, nice to talk to you.
[03:15:28.179 --> 03:15:29.460]  Good to talk to you.
[03:15:29.460 --> 03:15:31.841]  I've got two questions on two different issues here.
[03:15:31.841 --> 03:15:33.883]  The first one is Debra Medina.
[03:15:33.883 --> 03:15:36.945]  I heard her speak on the debate last week and I was quite impressed.
[03:15:36.945 --> 03:15:39.346]  Are you going to have her on your show?
[03:15:39.346 --> 03:15:40.507]  Yeah, she's in here.
[03:15:40.507 --> 03:15:42.728]  When next week?
[03:15:42.728 --> 03:15:44.129]  She's in studio next week.
[03:15:44.129 --> 03:15:45.950]  I know one day.
[03:15:45.950 --> 03:15:48.112]  Okay, I'll be waiting to listen to that one.
[03:15:49.500 --> 03:15:58.046]  Another one, I've been listening to you for about a year now, and I agree with about 95% of what you say, but one thing, on peak oil, the U.S.
[03:15:58.046 --> 03:16:03.950]  is in Iraq, seemingly, for the oil, and now they're in Afghanistan, Pakistan, to block pipelines to China.
[03:16:03.950 --> 03:16:07.992]  Why would they be doing that if peak oil was a hoax, and all made up?
[03:16:07.992 --> 03:16:11.875]  Well, that's a very easy way to answer that.
[03:16:11.875 --> 03:16:18.780]  It's confirmed that there's more oil discovered, proven reserves, in Alaska than there is in Saudi Arabia.
[03:16:19.580 --> 03:16:31.490]  On one area, one small field, there is enough to run the country for another 50 years, but they will not allow those pipelines to be brought in because it's artificial scarcity.
[03:16:31.490 --> 03:16:40.238]  There's too much oil, there's too much natural gas, and so if they don't shut down large sectors of the Gulf of Mexico and Alaska and other areas,
[03:16:41.761 --> 03:16:45.744]  Then, they won't be able to have their huge profits.
[03:16:45.744 --> 03:16:50.287]  They don't want China and other countries to have their own cheap oil.
[03:16:50.287 --> 03:16:54.009]  They want them to have to buy it from Western oil companies.
[03:16:54.009 --> 03:16:56.511]  And so, it's just like De Beers.
[03:16:56.511 --> 03:16:59.393]  You know, if there's so many diamonds in the world, why are they so expensive?
[03:16:59.393 --> 03:17:06.337]  Because De Beers, owned by the Oppenheimers and others, a big consortium, they have a world diamond monopoly.
[03:17:06.337 --> 03:17:07.258]  That's a fact, sir.
[03:17:08.259 --> 03:17:13.930]  And so they're trying to make sure that they can make oil more scarce.
[03:17:13.930 --> 03:17:14.972]  Oil in Alaska is proven.
[03:17:14.972 --> 03:17:16.454]  Where can I go to see this proof?
[03:17:18.388 --> 03:17:20.669]  It's so voluminous, it's completely insane.
[03:17:20.669 --> 03:17:27.092]  They've only allowed one small area there on the West Slope to be opened, a few other areas.
[03:17:27.092 --> 03:17:35.036]  The oil companies admit they could build more than 10 pipelines the size of the one they have that already supplies, what is it, 14% of U.S.
[03:17:35.036 --> 03:17:36.636]  needs on the West Coast.
[03:17:36.636 --> 03:17:39.898]  The rest of it sold that they pumped to the Japanese and Chinese.
[03:17:41.098 --> 03:17:43.140]  I mean, it's just common knowledge.
[03:17:43.140 --> 03:17:44.621]  It's admitted everywhere.
[03:17:44.621 --> 03:17:52.847]  There's an oil field, 640 square miles, right off of Louisiana and Mississippi, that's just everywhere you drill, you hit oil.
[03:17:52.847 --> 03:17:56.971]  I mean, everywhere you drill, you hit oil, sir, in that area.
[03:17:56.971 --> 03:18:00.013]  Getting back to Deborah Medina, do you think she has a chance at winning that governorship?
[03:18:03.024 --> 03:18:06.245]  If the mainstream media covered her more and said she could win, yes.
[03:18:06.245 --> 03:18:07.985]  And she is rising in the polls.
[03:18:07.985 --> 03:18:18.488]  And other patriots, other people out there need to run at their different state levels for similar positions.
[03:18:18.488 --> 03:18:26.910]  It's showing people, just like what we just saw in Massachusetts, that if you start early enough, you can basically beat any big incumbent.
[03:18:26.910 --> 03:18:29.111]  People aren't just mad at Democrats.
[03:18:29.111 --> 03:18:30.431]  They're mad at incumbents.
[03:18:32.880 --> 03:18:34.680]  Well, I'm trying to spread the word on the forums.
[03:18:34.680 --> 03:18:38.781]  Coming from Canada, I really can't vote, but I hope her all the best.
[03:18:38.781 --> 03:18:39.421]  Thank you, Peter.
[03:18:39.421 --> 03:18:40.761]  I appreciate your call.
[03:18:40.761 --> 03:18:42.282]  By the way, we have her in here the 26th.
[03:18:42.282 --> 03:18:44.482]  So that is it this week.
[03:18:44.482 --> 03:18:47.143]  It's next week, and she's been in studio with us.
[03:18:47.143 --> 03:18:49.463]  Okay, previously, a few months ago.
[03:18:49.463 --> 03:18:50.243]  Let's go ahead.
[03:18:50.243 --> 03:18:55.124]  It's our supporters, just like with Ron Paul, that are really energizing her, along with many others.
[03:18:55.124 --> 03:18:57.684]  Let's go ahead and talk to Ray in Colorado.
[03:18:57.684 --> 03:18:59.265]  Ray, you're on the air.
[03:18:59.265 --> 03:18:59.485]  Hi, Alex.
[03:18:59.485 --> 03:19:00.865]  How are you?
[03:19:02.854 --> 03:19:07.137]  So I just wanted to give this quote out for your listeners.
[03:19:07.137 --> 03:19:13.861]  It pretty much has to do with the fear tactics the government is using against us and all the false flag attacks.
[03:19:13.861 --> 03:19:16.462]  It just is perfect when I found it.
[03:19:16.462 --> 03:19:23.386]  Those who can give up essential liberty to obtain a little temporary safety deserve neither liberty nor safety.
[03:19:23.386 --> 03:19:24.247]  Benjamin Franklin!
[03:19:26.317 --> 03:19:29.639]  Yeah, and I just thought it would be really good for you to hear about it.
[03:19:29.639 --> 03:19:31.500]  Well, that's how tyranny works.
[03:19:31.500 --> 03:19:33.841]  Somebody might do something illegal with guns.
[03:19:33.841 --> 03:19:35.602]  We've got to ban all your guns.
[03:19:35.602 --> 03:19:37.843]  Some parent might abuse their child.
[03:19:37.843 --> 03:19:42.006]  We've got to ban parents raising their kids.
[03:19:42.006 --> 03:19:45.268]  Somebody might shout at their spouse and a fight might get started.
[03:19:45.268 --> 03:19:47.969]  So we're going to arrest you if you shout at each other.
[03:19:47.969 --> 03:19:52.051]  Meanwhile, the government's mass murdering, poisoning our food, poisoning our water.
[03:19:52.051 --> 03:19:53.052]  They think we're animals.
[03:19:53.052 --> 03:19:54.012]  They want to get rid of us.
[03:19:54.012 --> 03:19:54.593]  Anything else?
[03:19:57.667 --> 03:20:01.732]  Well, I'm just saying that I'm a nanny and I work for, you know...
[03:20:11.337 --> 03:20:12.137]  We're good to go!
[03:20:34.003 --> 03:20:35.344]  We're good to go.
[03:21:03.220 --> 03:21:05.582]  Are you wondering about your retirement portfolio?
[03:21:05.582 --> 03:21:11.808]  Are you confident that the financial advisor is experienced enough to combat climbing interest rates, taxes, and inflation?

[03:21:39.788 --> 03:21:40.069]  I think so.
[03:22:02.910 --> 03:22:06.959]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[03:22:06.959 --> 03:22:10.206]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[03:22:10.206 --> 03:22:11.608]  As we're finishing off this agenda...
[03:22:12.313 --> 03:22:14.994]  They'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[03:22:14.994 --> 03:22:21.375]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[03:22:21.375 --> 03:22:26.556]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[03:22:26.556 --> 03:22:36.538]  Fall of the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation, the criminal offshore cartel, hell-bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government.
[03:22:36.678 --> 03:22:39.020]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists!
[03:22:39.020 --> 03:22:40.602]  They're asking for more matches!
[03:22:40.602 --> 03:22:43.064]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[03:22:43.064 --> 03:22:45.207]  Today, it seems like nobody does care.
[03:22:45.207 --> 03:22:50.352]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[03:22:50.352 --> 03:22:59.461]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[03:23:01.531 --> 03:23:03.952]  A revolution in smoking is underway.
[03:23:03.952 --> 03:23:07.813]  A revolution all smokers of traditional cigarettes should know about.
[03:23:07.813 --> 03:23:11.415]  Keep listening for a special offer from PowerVapor.com.
[03:23:11.415 --> 03:23:15.416]  Standard tobacco cigarettes contain over 4,000 harmful chemicals.
[03:23:15.416 --> 03:23:19.718]  Now it's time to release yourself from the grip of big tobacco and experience
[03:23:19.718 --> 03:23:21.220]  It's true smoking freedom!
[03:23:39.701 --> 03:23:40.181]  I think so.
[03:24:06.588 --> 03:24:08.989]  Waging war on corruption.
[03:24:08.989 --> 03:24:16.574]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[03:24:16.574 --> 03:24:23.198]  Ron Paul, ladies and gentlemen, article up at Infowars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[03:24:23.198 --> 03:24:26.299]  He says, abolish the CIA.
[03:24:26.299 --> 03:24:30.022]  He said, we need to get rid of it.
[03:24:30.022 --> 03:24:30.942]  We need to take it out.
[03:24:30.942 --> 03:24:33.504]  In fact, what's the actual
[03:24:34.890 --> 03:24:35.591]  Actual quote.
[03:24:35.591 --> 03:24:35.931]  You know what?
[03:24:35.931 --> 03:24:40.095]  Let's just play Ron Paul's quote again right now instead of me just sitting here.
[03:24:41.309 --> 03:24:51.253]  And paraphrasing it, this is Ron Paul this week at the Campaign for Liberty, one of the regional rallies, and here he is saying, we need to abolish and get rid of the CIA.
[03:24:51.253 --> 03:24:53.674]  They've had a coup over our government, and they have.
[03:24:53.674 --> 03:24:59.977]  Republicans and Democrats come and go, but the CIA stays in power.
[03:24:59.977 --> 03:25:01.178]  It's the shadow government.
[03:25:01.178 --> 03:25:03.178]  It's a big part of the shadow government.
[03:25:03.178 --> 03:25:05.239]  He goes on to say, get rid of it.
[03:25:05.239 --> 03:25:06.060]  This is courage.
[03:25:06.060 --> 03:25:06.580]  Here's Ron Paul.
[03:25:07.220 --> 03:25:12.084]  I mean, they're almost like they lived in a different world.
[03:25:12.084 --> 03:25:18.348]  The military's down, the morale is down, the money is in the air, they're going looking for a couple more wars to fight!
[03:25:18.348 --> 03:25:20.349]  It makes no sense whatsoever.
[03:25:20.349 --> 03:25:26.674]  But no, we don't have to worry about the military anymore, because there's been a coup, have you heard?
[03:25:27.114 --> 03:25:28.637]  It's the CIA coup.
[03:25:28.637 --> 03:25:30.520]  The CIA runs everything.
[03:25:30.520 --> 03:25:31.682]  They run the military.
[03:25:31.682 --> 03:25:36.790]  They're the ones who are over there lobbing missiles and bombs on these countries.
[03:25:36.790 --> 03:25:38.513]  It's not even the military that does that.
[03:25:38.513 --> 03:25:39.695]  The CIA runs this.
[03:25:40.231 --> 03:25:45.815]  And of course, the CIA has never been as secret as the Federal Reserve.
[03:25:45.815 --> 03:25:51.799]  And yet, think of the harm that they have done since they were established, since World War II.
[03:25:51.799 --> 03:26:04.368]  They are a government unto themselves, they're in businesses, they're in drug businesses, and they take on dictators.
[03:26:04.368 --> 03:26:05.649]  Is that not powerful?
[03:26:06.926 --> 03:26:08.347]  That's Congressman Ron Paul.
[03:26:08.347 --> 03:26:15.151]  You can go watch the video at PrisonPlanet.com and InfoWars.com.
[03:26:15.151 --> 03:26:16.832]  In fact, I'm trying to give you the exact headline.
[03:26:16.832 --> 03:26:18.173]  It's lost somewhere.
[03:26:19.110 --> 03:26:22.693]  Here in my stack if you want to go watch that video.
[03:26:22.693 --> 03:26:31.822]  My guys are writing so many articles and posting so much that here it is, Ron Paul, the CIA runs everything.
[03:26:31.822 --> 03:26:39.509]  That's a quote from Ron Paul and you can watch that video and you can read the article that Kurt Nemo put together.
[03:26:40.590 --> 03:26:56.959]  And then we fished out another clip from documentary filmmakers here in Austin, Texas that Tommy Pallotta worked on in the late 1980s interviewing Ron Paul where he's talking about the CIA drug dealing and George Bush Sr.
[03:26:56.959 --> 03:26:58.460]  drug dealing.
[03:26:58.460 --> 03:27:00.101]  Now that's powerful info.
[03:27:00.101 --> 03:27:03.142]  And you notice the media knew about these clips during the campaign.
[03:27:03.142 --> 03:27:05.563]  They didn't want to go after Ron Paul on that because the CIA
[03:27:07.492 --> 03:27:13.537]  A solicitor inspector general found in 1996 that they were running in most of the narcotics into the country.
[03:27:13.537 --> 03:27:15.938]  This is an open secret!
[03:27:15.938 --> 03:27:20.162]  Just like it's an open secret that illegal aliens are above the law.
[03:27:20.162 --> 03:27:27.087]  Did you know that all over the country, in almost every major city, over 800 cities, illegals don't get DWIs.
[03:27:27.087 --> 03:27:28.568]  They don't get speeding tickets.
[03:27:28.568 --> 03:27:30.609]  They don't get arrested for not having a driver's license.
[03:27:30.609 --> 03:27:31.110]  Citizens do.
[03:27:32.270 --> 03:27:36.631]  And I talked to some of the Hispanic lobbying groups and they say, well, that's okay.
[03:27:36.631 --> 03:27:38.712]  Everybody else gets arrested, but illegals.
[03:27:38.712 --> 03:27:41.692]  You're a racist if you are for you having the same rights.
[03:27:41.692 --> 03:27:47.174]  I mean, America is a joke, ladies and gentlemen.
[03:27:47.174 --> 03:27:54.335]  The Austin Police Department can shut down a legal gun show because they say so without a law, but illegal aliens are above the law.
[03:27:54.335 --> 03:27:56.616]  This is a sick joke.
[03:27:56.616 --> 03:27:57.536]  This is a sick joke.
[03:27:58.860 --> 03:28:02.923]  And the government set the precedent, they're now giving matriculas out, not just to Mexicans.
[03:28:02.923 --> 03:28:07.987]  The Mexican government pioneered this and made payoffs to people illegally in government to do it.
[03:28:07.987 --> 03:28:16.133]  Now all these other countries, Poland's issuing their own card, Russia's doing it, Venezuela, Nicaragua, El Salvador, they're all issuing them.
[03:28:16.133 --> 03:28:22.598]  So, you don't have any rights if you're a citizen, but you don't just have rights, you're above the law if you're a foreigner.
[03:28:24.878 --> 03:28:32.520]  Because the government wants to give welfare and grease the skids for foreigners to come here to make them a political weapon against the Republic.
[03:28:32.520 --> 03:28:36.240]  To remove the middle class and to bankrupt the nation for the banks.
[03:28:36.240 --> 03:28:39.741]  The country is imploding into tyranny.
[03:28:39.741 --> 03:28:43.522]  It's falling apart.
[03:28:43.522 --> 03:28:52.584]  And again, I was talking to one of my employees who formerly, a few years ago, worked at the city of Austin in gas and power, and he said more than 90% of the illegals don't pay their bills.
[03:28:53.715 --> 03:28:59.938]  And they just have another illegal come in, six months later when they get their gas turned off, and start a new matricula cart.
[03:28:59.938 --> 03:29:02.820]  And they're ordered, you will give them free power.
[03:29:02.820 --> 03:29:04.221]  You will give them free gas.
[03:29:04.221 --> 03:29:08.743]  This is what we've been told to do.
[03:29:08.743 --> 03:29:15.707]  And again, just the illustration of how lawless government is.
[03:29:15.707 --> 03:29:17.928]  How lawless they've become.
[03:29:25.111 --> 03:29:32.977]  We're going to come back, blitz through a bunch of news, and then go to your phone calls.
[03:29:32.977 --> 03:29:34.298]  Again, I'm Alex Jones, your host.
[03:29:34.298 --> 03:29:36.980]  We're here live Monday through Friday from 11 a.m.
[03:29:36.980 --> 03:29:37.560]  to 3 p.m.
[03:29:37.560 --> 03:29:39.062]  Central Standard Time.
[03:29:39.062 --> 03:29:44.786]  And then we come back, of course, Sundays 4 to 6 p.m.
[03:29:44.786 --> 03:29:46.687]  And we just continue to expose the tyranny.
[03:29:46.687 --> 03:29:48.549]  If we do that, the New World Order will fall.
[03:29:52.006 --> 03:29:55.928]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[03:29:55.928 --> 03:30:01.651]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[03:30:01.651 --> 03:30:02.812]  What's your home worth?
[03:30:02.812 --> 03:30:04.933]  How can you compare local real estate agents?
[03:30:04.933 --> 03:30:07.975]  And how do you get MLS listings for the entire country?
[03:30:07.975 --> 03:30:15.679]  If you're thinking of buying a home to take advantage of a tax credit or selling your house, you first need to see an incredible website called HomeGain.com.

[03:31:03.046 --> 03:31:07.067]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[03:31:07.067 --> 03:31:10.328]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[03:31:10.328 --> 03:31:11.728]  As we're finishing off this agenda,
[03:31:12.446 --> 03:31:15.107]  They'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[03:31:15.107 --> 03:31:21.508]  I have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[03:31:21.508 --> 03:31:26.690]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[03:31:26.690 --> 03:31:36.672]  Fall of the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation, the criminal offshore cartel, hell-bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government.
[03:31:36.812 --> 03:31:39.154]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists!
[03:31:39.154 --> 03:31:40.735]  They're asking for more matches!
[03:31:40.735 --> 03:31:43.197]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[03:31:43.197 --> 03:31:45.319]  Today, it seems like nobody does care.
[03:31:45.319 --> 03:31:50.483]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[03:31:50.483 --> 03:31:59.830]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[03:32:01.644 --> 03:32:02.425]  Hi, everyone.
[03:32:02.425 --> 03:32:03.486]  Andy Anderson here.
[03:32:03.486 --> 03:32:07.911]  Are you using those little bottles of hand gel that kill germs, bacteria, and other nasties?
[03:32:07.911 --> 03:32:13.697]  In today's world, that's smart, especially with the filthy doorknobs, shopping carts, and handrails we touch every day.
[03:32:13.697 --> 03:32:18.042]  Did you know that once the alcohol evaporates in a few seconds, good-bye effectiveness?
[03:32:18.042 --> 03:32:19.744]  No more protection till you use it again.
[03:32:19.884 --> 03:32:21.224]  PureWorks to the rescue!
[03:32:21.224 --> 03:32:25.625]  Our FDA-compliant foam, lotion, soap, and spray do not contain alcohol.
[03:32:25.625 --> 03:32:27.826]  Their killing power lasts up to four hours.
[03:32:27.826 --> 03:32:40.889]  PureWorks Disinfecting Spray is EPA-certified to kill swine flu, bird flu, MRSA, HIV, hepatitis B and C, and for our friends in medicine, kills C. diff, along with a whole host of viruses and bacteria, moles, and fungus, too.
[03:32:40.889 --> 03:32:42.449]  It's even safe around pets and children.
[03:32:42.529 --> 03:32:45.711]  You'll love how your skin feels with PureWorks Soft and Supple.
[03:32:45.711 --> 03:32:46.871]  No more dry skin.
[03:32:46.871 --> 03:32:51.474]  Here's to a little peace of mind knowing that your hands are still germ-free hours later.
[03:32:51.474 --> 03:32:58.658]  Call now toll-free 888-245-0300 to get your hands on PureWorks and get PureWorks on your hands.
[03:32:58.658 --> 03:32:58.938]  That's 888-245-0300.
[03:33:27.296 --> 03:33:30.278]  I did tune into Glenn Beck for about a minute this morning, and I had to turn it off.
[03:33:30.278 --> 03:33:33.839]  I just couldn't listen to his voice, and I was getting a cell phone call in my car.
[03:33:33.839 --> 03:33:46.966]  And I did hear him making fun of, uh, of, uh, you know, the Democrats' big documentary filmmaker and saying, uh, we'll see.
[03:33:48.999 --> 03:33:55.725]  How the maker of Fahrenheit 9-11, Michael Moore, likes what I'm going to do.
[03:33:55.725 --> 03:33:59.608]  And the caller said he says he's going to make documentaries now.
[03:33:59.608 --> 03:34:07.395]  That may not be copying me, but him using all my terms and then twisting it around is.
[03:34:07.395 --> 03:34:11.219]  And remember a year ago, Fox launched this website.
[03:34:14.448 --> 03:34:20.469]  Fox Nation that just looks just like PrisonPlanet.com and InfoWars.com and runs the same kind of news.
[03:34:20.469 --> 03:34:28.692]  See, they want the Patriot Libertarian audience, but they don't want it for their main Fox audience.
[03:34:28.692 --> 03:34:34.613]  And so, there was an InfoWars.com article about how Fox launches a clone.
[03:34:34.613 --> 03:34:40.754]  In fact, post that article if you can, the original article that we wrote about that.
[03:34:46.124 --> 03:34:47.385]  That's the type of information.
[03:34:47.385 --> 03:34:53.508]  Fox launches Infowars.com clone website attempt to cannibalize the Patriot movement.
[03:34:53.508 --> 03:34:56.269]  And that was written back in April of 2009.
[03:34:56.269 --> 03:35:06.834]  And they've now taken over much of the Patriot movement and are misdirecting it into pro-war, pro-Patriot act, new taxes as the answer to Obama.
[03:35:06.834 --> 03:35:09.435]  And again, that's why we've got to counter him.
[03:35:09.435 --> 03:35:10.996]  I've kind of ignored it.
[03:35:10.996 --> 03:35:12.697]  I've tried to be somewhat friendly.
[03:35:13.812 --> 03:35:24.614]  They've tried to do olive branches and Fox has plugged us a lot and had me on Napolitano's show and done a few little things like that.
[03:35:24.614 --> 03:35:27.775]  But I just, I just don't want to be invited to the party.
[03:35:27.775 --> 03:35:32.156]  I mean, it just makes me sick even thinking about it.
[03:35:32.156 --> 03:35:33.736]  I don't want to be on Fox News.
[03:35:33.736 --> 03:35:35.016]  I don't want to be with them.
[03:35:35.016 --> 03:35:37.577]  I don't want to go say the Muslims want to kill us.
[03:35:37.577 --> 03:35:38.497]  Give up all your rights.
[03:35:38.497 --> 03:35:39.477]  Al Qaeda is going to get you.
[03:35:39.477 --> 03:35:41.418]  I just, I don't even want to do this anymore.
[03:35:41.418 --> 03:35:42.198]  I'm just sick of it.
[03:35:43.345 --> 03:35:48.006]  And yes, Glenn Beck is going to make, quote, underground documentaries, of course he is.
[03:35:48.006 --> 03:35:50.327]  They know my films are devastating them.
[03:35:50.327 --> 03:35:51.727]  They're exposing the left-right paradigm.
[03:35:51.727 --> 03:36:01.990]  That's why it's so important that all of you get Fall of the Republic and The Obama Deception and make copies of the DVD and never stop giving them out because it exposes them all.
[03:36:01.990 --> 03:36:09.471]  You could show Fall of the Republic or The Obama Deception to a liberal or a conservative and it breaks their paradigm and the game's over.
[03:36:09.471 --> 03:36:12.072]  And if we could get this out to everybody, that would indeed happen.
[03:36:21.806 --> 03:36:47.921]  Now a lot of people were excited today to hear that the Supreme Court had ruled against the First Amendment violations that are involved in the McCain-Feingold campaign finance reform of now eight years ago.
[03:36:47.921 --> 03:36:50.103]  I'm actually looking for my articles.
[03:36:51.229 --> 03:36:53.771]  I had a whole bunch of them here.
[03:36:53.771 --> 03:36:54.151]  Here it is.
[03:36:54.151 --> 03:36:59.314]  Supreme Court removes limits on corporate labor donations to campaigns.
[03:36:59.314 --> 03:37:01.095]  And I read the ruling.
[03:37:01.095 --> 03:37:09.880]  All it does is take the restrictions off of labor unions and big corporations to give money six weeks before an election.
[03:37:09.880 --> 03:37:16.865]  But it left the changes in there where citizens are limited how much private money they can give.
[03:37:16.865 --> 03:37:17.205]  And so
[03:37:19.022 --> 03:37:27.646]  The original restriction doubled the amount of money corporations could give, but put limits on how close to a campaign they could do it.
[03:37:27.646 --> 03:37:35.430]  Now, and I've got to read the full ruling, I tried to this morning, scanned over it, but there's no mention anywhere here.
[03:37:35.430 --> 03:37:44.635]  And obviously it was unconstitutional to say Hillary the movie couldn't even show in theaters before an election, back during the election.
[03:37:46.653 --> 03:37:47.873]  Courts tried to rule that.
[03:37:47.873 --> 03:37:54.756]  I mean, obviously, you can make a documentary about Hillary Clinton as free speech and show it, and no campaign rule can do that.
[03:37:54.756 --> 03:38:07.021]  So the good news is, it threw that out, but it's left, and no one's talking about that, the restrictions on, I can only give, what is it, $3,000 to Ron Paul and then I'm done?
[03:38:07.021 --> 03:38:07.701]  As an individual?
[03:38:11.494 --> 03:38:17.417]  So, but I guess individuals need to sue now, so that they give their rights to give.
[03:38:17.417 --> 03:38:24.159]  Because now if labor unions and corporations can give unlimited, but citizens can't, we're in trouble.
[03:38:24.159 --> 03:38:27.481]  So it's good in that it defends some of the First Amendment, but it's unequal.
[03:38:28.467 --> 03:38:36.435]  It's like Obama's health care plan saying certain states and labor unions are exempt from the taxes on health care plans.
[03:38:36.435 --> 03:38:37.896]  I mean, you can't do that.
[03:38:37.896 --> 03:38:47.005]  Just like Obama said, if you're a Democratic contributor, you get to keep your 90-year-old or 70-year-old, in some of the cases, car dealership.
[03:38:47.005 --> 03:38:50.088]  But if you're not, we're taking it because the government runs GM.
[03:38:50.088 --> 03:38:51.270]  I mean, that really happened.
[03:38:51.270 --> 03:38:52.431]  I mean, this is so lawless.
[03:38:58.846 --> 03:39:04.549]  I just can't believe that this is all going on and that these people are actually getting away with this.
[03:39:04.549 --> 03:39:08.471]  I'm going to get into some of the other good news I've got here, but I'm going to be quite frank with you.
[03:39:08.471 --> 03:39:09.592]  I've let my desk get messy.
[03:39:09.592 --> 03:39:15.155]  I need to clean it off tonight because the desk has just got the last week's news on it.
[03:39:15.155 --> 03:39:18.937]  Give me a shot on that camera so folks can see this, or maybe a document cam shot.
[03:39:18.937 --> 03:39:24.920]  I mean, I'm just waiting in information.
[03:39:24.920 --> 03:39:25.961]  I'm actually drowning in it.
[03:39:29.235 --> 03:39:31.436]  This is one week of news.
[03:39:31.436 --> 03:39:48.784]  Last Sunday I came in here and cleaned off my desk, and every one of these stories is just a nightmare of evil, a nightmare of government corruption.
[03:39:48.784 --> 03:39:50.004]  I am going to take a few days off.
[03:39:50.004 --> 03:39:52.285]  Every once in a while I get really tired.
[03:39:52.285 --> 03:39:53.546]  When I get emotionally spent,
[03:39:56.673 --> 03:40:00.116]  I'm freaked out about all the work we've done and now Glenn Beck's just taking it all over.
[03:40:00.116 --> 03:40:08.984]  I'm freaked out about him shutting down the gun show without a law and laughing about it.
[03:40:08.984 --> 03:40:11.125]  But I should be positive.
[03:40:11.125 --> 03:40:12.687]  I mean, so much is coming out.
[03:40:12.687 --> 03:40:15.749]  People are actually reading what the White House czars are saying.
[03:40:15.749 --> 03:40:16.310]  They're actually
[03:40:17.694 --> 03:40:20.597]  You know, TSA nominee Eroll Southers withdraws.
[03:40:20.597 --> 03:40:30.045]  President Obama's nominee to head the Transportation Security Administration withdrew from consideration on Wednesday, saying his nomination was obstructed by political ideology.
[03:40:30.045 --> 03:40:44.517]  Eroll Southers had faced fierce opposition from Republicans ever since news surfaced that he may have misled Congress about an incident in the late 80s involving a background check of the boyfriend of his ex-wife.
[03:40:48.038 --> 03:40:51.121]  I mean, yeah, they use these databases to harass people.
[03:40:51.121 --> 03:40:59.529]  But the real reason he got in trouble is he gave video interviews saying the number one enemy of America is Christians, and that's the number one terror threat.
[03:40:59.529 --> 03:41:00.910]  We played that in the last few weeks.
[03:41:00.910 --> 03:41:05.895]  So, you know, the good news is this guy won't have access to your wife's naked body.
[03:41:05.895 --> 03:41:11.981]  I mean, he likes access to data illegally, so God knows what he'll do with the naked body scanners.
[03:41:13.322 --> 03:41:17.425]  Here's Beck Perrott's White House Information Czar Talking Points, Curt Nemo.
[03:41:17.425 --> 03:41:20.447]  That's a key story, you need to read that.
[03:41:20.447 --> 03:41:24.710]  H1N1 swine flu hoax falls apart at the seams.
[03:41:24.710 --> 03:41:31.014]  It's openly coming out that it's a criminal operation, that they're doing a criminal inquiry in the EU.
[03:41:31.014 --> 03:41:32.455]  Let me read some of this.
[03:41:32.455 --> 03:41:41.381]  Here's an article from Steve Watson about it on Tuesday, and then there's another great article we got up at InfoWars.com by Mike Adams of Natural News.
[03:41:44.557 --> 03:41:50.443]  International hearings begin on falsified swine flu pandemic.
[03:41:50.443 --> 03:42:05.678]  The Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe, a 47-member body encompassing democratically elected members of the Parliament, has begun hearings to investigate whether H1N1 swine flu pandemic was falsified or exaggerated in an attempt to profit the vaccine sales.
[03:42:06.616 --> 03:42:13.560]  And then it's got the director of it saying it was all hype, it was a lie, it was a fraud, the vaccine is dangerous.
[03:42:13.560 --> 03:42:17.882]  I mean it sounds like Alex Jones runs that Council of Europe.
[03:42:17.882 --> 03:42:18.903]  In order to promote their
[03:42:20.250 --> 03:42:39.475]  Patented drugs and vaccines against flu and pharmaceutical companies influence scientists and official agencies responsible for public health standards to alarm governments worldwide and make them squander tight health resources for insufficient vaccine strategies and needless expose millions of healthy people to the risk of an unknown amount of side effects
[03:42:40.762 --> 03:42:41.722]  Who's reporting this?
[03:42:41.722 --> 03:42:43.403]  The EU Health Board out of Strasbourg?
[03:43:07.008 --> 03:43:08.889]  Who else is reporting this?
[03:43:08.889 --> 03:43:13.911]  Fox News, Associated Press, Reuters, Washington Post.
[03:43:13.911 --> 03:43:15.492]  I mean, look at this.
[03:43:15.492 --> 03:43:16.773]  I like Mike Adams' articles.
[03:43:16.773 --> 03:43:18.173]  They're like InfoWars articles.
[03:43:18.173 --> 03:43:20.774]  He's gracious to let us post them in full.
[03:43:20.774 --> 03:43:23.576]  But naturalnews.com's the main site.
[03:43:23.576 --> 03:43:29.779]  Because just every paragraph is multiple links to all the mainstream news and documents and drug inserts.
[03:43:29.779 --> 03:43:30.599]  And I mean, here it is.
[03:43:30.599 --> 03:43:34.381]  Washington Post, CDC, Reuters.
[03:43:35.612 --> 03:43:37.073]  Fox News.
[03:43:37.073 --> 03:43:46.959]  So, I mean, when you give somebody these articles by Steve Watson or by Mike Adams... Let's get Mike Adams on next week.
[03:43:46.959 --> 03:43:50.021]  Let's get him on to talk about this in hindsight.
[03:43:50.021 --> 03:43:51.462]  So when somebody says, how dare you?
[03:43:51.462 --> 03:43:52.763]  You gotta take the shot.
[03:43:52.763 --> 03:43:54.644]  You should be arrested if you don't take the shot.
[03:43:54.644 --> 03:43:58.146]  You should be sued if you don't take it, like Dr. Dina Dell said.
[03:43:58.146 --> 03:44:02.969]  That guy gets up there on the radio every time I hear him, because he comes on before me on the weekend on KLBJ.
[03:44:02.969 --> 03:44:03.570]  I listen to him.
[03:44:04.707 --> 03:44:07.711]  And he says there are no side effects, it's all a lie.
[03:44:07.711 --> 03:44:09.393]  You need to be arrested if you don't take it.
[03:44:09.393 --> 03:44:11.997]  Well, I mean, here it is admitted.
[03:44:11.997 --> 03:44:16.924]  I mean, the British and German and other governments, they wouldn't even take it themselves.
[03:44:18.641 --> 03:44:19.882]  It does brain damage you.
[03:44:19.882 --> 03:44:21.524]  It does cause neurological disorders.
[03:44:21.524 --> 03:44:23.385]  It does cause Guillain-Barre.
[03:44:23.385 --> 03:44:25.487]  It does do all of this.
[03:44:25.487 --> 03:44:29.231]  It does, in many cases, reduce fertility or outright sterilize you.
[03:44:29.231 --> 03:44:31.413]  It does cause autoimmune disorders.
[03:44:31.413 --> 03:44:32.353]  It's a fact, folks.
[03:44:32.353 --> 03:44:34.115]  We just told you the truth.
[03:44:34.115 --> 03:44:36.277]  Like I told you the truth about Obama.
[03:44:36.277 --> 03:44:37.938]  Like I tell you the truth about Glenn Beck.
[03:44:37.938 --> 03:44:39.680]  I mean, I do the research.
[03:44:39.680 --> 03:44:40.621]  This is all I do.
[03:44:40.621 --> 03:44:41.762]  I'm obsessed with it too much.
[03:44:47.691 --> 03:44:51.072]  And I think about the fact that they were still able to shut down so many people.
[03:44:51.072 --> 03:44:54.333]  I think about the fact they were still able to con so many people.
[03:44:54.333 --> 03:45:06.277]  I think about the fact that so many women, and I know you printed it again, but you printed it for me, I can't find it in the stack, all the mainstream news articles about all the unexpected miscarriages from the shot.
[03:45:06.277 --> 03:45:08.337]  That's being talked about in the investigation.
[03:45:08.337 --> 03:45:13.699]  And notice in the major EU investigation, because their doctors aren't corrupt bureaucrats, I'm sure they'll all be fired now,
[03:45:16.311 --> 03:45:19.552]  They're talking about the campaign of 2005-2006.
[03:45:19.552 --> 03:45:28.896]  They did tests up until 2008 where more than 30% of the people that took the experimental bird flu shot would die.
[03:45:28.896 --> 03:45:30.557]  That's London Telegraph.
[03:45:30.557 --> 03:45:35.639]  I mean, they're giving 100 homeless people the shot and 31 are dying.
[03:45:35.639 --> 03:45:40.101]  The government knows it!
[03:45:40.101 --> 03:45:43.983]  They know the Monsanto corn causes massive liver failure and kidney failure.
[03:45:44.997 --> 03:45:48.378]  They know these other GMO crops are designed to sterilize you.
[03:45:48.378 --> 03:45:53.980]  Why do I even have to get up here and explain this to people?
[03:45:53.980 --> 03:46:01.522]  Why do I get called a conspiracy theorist when all I do is the research?
[03:46:01.522 --> 03:46:03.703]  Why do I have to be enemies with the police?
[03:46:03.703 --> 03:46:05.203]  You're just like me!
[03:46:05.203 --> 03:46:08.064]  You put your pants on one leg at a time, you've got children,
[03:46:09.738 --> 03:46:28.787]  These varieties of potatoes, tomatoes, and corn, and soybeans, and wheat that are GMO, they are specifically going in there and changing the chemical composition to sterilize you, to brain damage you, to give you cancer, to make your organs fail.
[03:46:28.787 --> 03:46:31.128]  I know that's scary.
[03:46:31.128 --> 03:46:35.129]  I know that's hard to believe.
[03:46:35.129 --> 03:46:37.330]  Please investigate.
[03:46:37.330 --> 03:46:38.651]  I don't expect you to believe me.
[03:46:40.433 --> 03:46:57.598]  I don't expect you to believe me, but for God's sakes, at least check into what I've told you, please.
[03:46:57.598 --> 03:47:01.639]  I'm freaked out by Barack Obama and all his cult followers.
[03:47:01.639 --> 03:47:06.520]  I am freaked out by Glenn Beck taking over our tea parties that Ron Paul started.
[03:47:08.502 --> 03:47:12.585]  I'm freaked out by everything we do gets like alchemy.
[03:47:12.585 --> 03:47:23.612]  They turn the gold into crap.
[03:47:23.612 --> 03:47:28.476]  And I just wish that Glenn Beck would not be a sniveling little trader.
[03:47:28.476 --> 03:47:32.098]  He knows what he's doing.
[03:47:32.098 --> 03:47:37.622]  Folks, you got to tell Glenn Beck we are not going to have a national sales tax and we know the feds don't plan to replace the income tax with it.
[03:47:40.322 --> 03:47:41.966]  I've told you this for over 10 years.
[03:47:41.966 --> 03:47:43.109]  They were planning this.
[03:47:43.109 --> 03:47:44.192]  It's all now happening.
[03:47:44.192 --> 03:47:45.575]  They're trying everything right now.
[03:47:47.418 --> 03:47:49.599]  We've got to stop the Republicans, man.
[03:47:49.599 --> 03:47:51.119]  They are now coming into power.
[03:47:51.119 --> 03:47:52.519]  You watch.
[03:47:52.519 --> 03:47:55.860]  They are going to say, we've got to have taxes to pay these bankers off.
[03:47:55.860 --> 03:47:59.502]  They're pushing new taxing systems and anybody that does that is your enemy.
[03:47:59.502 --> 03:48:00.702]  We don't owe this money.
[03:48:00.702 --> 03:48:02.902]  It's a fraud to these offshore banks.
[03:48:02.902 --> 03:48:07.044]  Stop worrying about Obama and Republicans and Sarah Palin.
[03:48:07.044 --> 03:48:07.984]  They're all puppets.
[03:48:07.984 --> 03:48:14.706]  Start talking about the real power structure, the CIA and the Federal Reserve that Ron Paul's telling you about.
[03:48:16.812 --> 03:48:17.574]  It's simple.
[03:48:17.574 --> 03:48:22.667]  If somebody supports more wars and fake Patriot Act, they're an enemy!
[03:48:22.667 --> 03:48:24.952]  If somebody supports more taxes, they're an enemy!
[03:48:29.949 --> 03:48:34.411]  And I'm telling you, the only threat from Obama is a massive stage terror attack.
[03:48:34.411 --> 03:48:41.173]  And because of 9-11 truth, exposing government-sponsored terrorism, he may not be able to carry it out!
[03:48:41.173 --> 03:48:54.639]  They're in there with their tacticians and their theoreticians and their sociologists and their anthropologists and their people that crack the numbers and track the population, and they're trying to gauge how to beat us taking our country back right now.
[03:48:54.639 --> 03:48:57.280]  And I'm telling you, at the heart of it is Glenn Beck!
[03:49:03.291 --> 03:49:05.013]  And I'm shaken by the responsibility.
[03:49:05.013 --> 03:49:12.500]  I'm sick of the responsibility.
[03:49:12.500 --> 03:49:15.603]  And I'm sick of sniveling reporters coming to my office to interview me.
[03:49:15.603 --> 03:49:18.085]  They always do the same thing.
[03:49:18.085 --> 03:49:20.227]  I'm sick of weak people selling out to tyranny.
[03:49:20.227 --> 03:49:23.551]  I'm sick of weak-minded people that just go along with the system.
[03:49:24.773 --> 03:49:30.416]  Who buy into the left-right paradigm, who are either dumb leftists or moron mainline conservatives.
[03:49:30.416 --> 03:49:40.122]  There's nothing conservative about Roger Ailes, Glenn Beck, and the Republican leadership.
[03:49:40.122 --> 03:49:49.228]  Stop being a bunch of simpletons.
[03:49:49.228 --> 03:49:51.309]  We can beat these people.
[03:49:51.309 --> 03:49:54.151]  I have produced the weapons in the Infowar that will destroy them.
[03:49:55.669 --> 03:50:02.572]  If you don't get co-opted by Glenn Beck and all his warmongering and, you know, Lotus Glenn Beck saying Al Qaeda's gonna nuke us.
[03:50:02.572 --> 03:50:05.573]  Just like Obama is.
[03:50:05.573 --> 03:50:07.394]  Just like Cass Sunstein is.
[03:50:07.394 --> 03:50:13.076]  Folks, they're on the same page in reality.
[03:50:13.076 --> 03:50:16.277]  We're on the edge here, ladies and gentlemen.
[03:50:16.277 --> 03:50:17.698]  The enemy is like a cornered rat.
[03:50:26.112 --> 03:50:31.459]  And if Glenn Beck is unable to fully co-opt our movement, it's over for the New World Order.
[03:50:31.459 --> 03:50:34.783]  I mean, we're that close, ladies and gentlemen, in this process to beating him.
[03:50:37.290 --> 03:50:45.716]  So get Fall of the Republic, get the Obama deception, get DVD burners, get the free copies on YouTube, email them to everybody you know, post them on your website.
[03:50:45.716 --> 03:50:50.019]  It is vital because those films will expose the left-right paradigm.
[03:50:50.019 --> 03:50:58.705]  They will expose who the real enemy is so people stop worrying about Republicans and Democrats and realize it's the bankers that have to be dealt with and the CIA.
[03:50:58.705 --> 03:50:59.165]  Stay with us.
[03:51:01.977 --> 03:51:05.559]  America is in deep, deep trouble because we don't know our rights.
[03:51:05.559 --> 03:51:12.021]  Let's get real freedom back into America by teaching and promoting the Bill of Rights with the 2010 Freedom Calendar.
[03:51:12.021 --> 03:51:12.482]  Why?
[03:51:12.482 --> 03:51:14.523]  Because our forefathers gave them to us.
[03:51:14.523 --> 03:51:17.824]  Because the Freedom Calendar is true patriotism in action.
[03:51:17.824 --> 03:51:22.246]  And because if you don't know your rights and use them, you may lose them.
[03:51:22.246 --> 03:51:25.928]  The Freedom Calendar is the best educational tool in over 200 years.
[03:51:25.928 --> 03:51:29.249]  It shows in detail how to use your rights, how to answer any bureaucrat,
[03:51:29.369 --> 03:51:31.651]  How to use your guaranteed rights for true freedom.
[03:51:31.651 --> 03:51:35.993]  The Freedom Calendar is the easy way to learn the proper use and function of each of our rights.
[03:51:35.993 --> 03:51:39.916]  And is perfect for homeschoolers, business promotions, and fundraisers.

[03:51:45.740 --> 03:51:46.720]  The Freedom Calendar.
[03:51:46.720 --> 03:51:47.801]  Know your rights, or lose them.
[03:51:55.626 --> 03:51:57.448]  Order now while supplies last.
[03:51:57.448 --> 03:52:03.232]  Call 651-771-5234 today.
[03:52:03.232 --> 03:52:07.255]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[03:52:07.255 --> 03:52:10.498]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[03:52:10.498 --> 03:52:11.899]  As we're finishing off this agenda,
[03:52:12.617 --> 03:52:15.298]  They'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[03:52:15.298 --> 03:52:21.680]  I have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[03:52:21.680 --> 03:52:26.742]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[03:52:26.742 --> 03:52:36.846]  For the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation, the criminal offshore cartel, hell-bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government.
[03:52:36.966 --> 03:52:39.307]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists!
[03:52:39.307 --> 03:52:40.908]  They're asking for more matches!
[03:52:40.908 --> 03:52:43.369]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[03:52:43.369 --> 03:52:45.490]  Today seems like nobody does care.
[03:52:45.490 --> 03:52:50.633]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[03:52:50.633 --> 03:52:55.655]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com.
[03:52:55.655 --> 03:52:59.757]  Or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.

[03:53:10.164 --> 03:53:14.366]  You can get help today from the leading tax expert in the country, Dan Pilla.
[03:53:14.366 --> 03:53:15.606]  Hi, I'm Dan Pilla.
[03:53:15.606 --> 03:53:17.827]  The IRS isn't going to just forget about you.
[03:53:17.827 --> 03:53:23.009]  Right now, the IRS is hiring thousands of tax collectors to go after delinquent accounts just like yours.
[03:53:23.009 --> 03:53:26.270]  That's why you need to take action today and I can help.
[03:53:26.270 --> 03:53:29.812]  I take a simple but proven approach to solving your tax debt problem.
[03:53:29.812 --> 03:53:33.133]  First, I stabilize collections so you don't have to worry about wage and bank levies.

[03:53:54.523 --> 03:53:55.303]  Call us today at 800-346-6829.
[03:53:55.303 --> 03:53:55.624]  That's 800-34-NO-TAX.
[03:54:04.554 --> 03:54:21.769]  Some of the best news we've had in a long time.
[03:54:21.769 --> 03:54:26.193]  Bigger news than Scott Brown winning in Massachusetts.
[03:54:26.193 --> 03:54:28.335]  Financial Times of London, U.N.
[03:54:28.335 --> 03:54:30.317]  abandons climate change deadline.
[03:54:32.708 --> 03:54:46.455]  The timetable to reach a global deal to tackle climate change lay in tatters on Wednesday after the United Nations waived the first deadline of the process laid out by last month's fractious Copenhagen summit.
[03:54:46.455 --> 03:54:56.000]  So see, they tried to say, even though nobody signed on, the US, England, and the EU say, we're still going to have countries sign on individually with arm-twisting
[03:54:57.329 --> 03:55:07.471]  We're going to go ahead and start raising the taxes to fund this new IMF World Bank run system that will categorize all the world's carbon footprints.
[03:55:07.471 --> 03:55:08.951]  That is now falling apart.
[03:55:08.951 --> 03:55:21.553]  I mean, it is in burning, ruined, incinerated tatters, crashing and burning right now.
[03:55:21.553 --> 03:55:26.754]  Yav Deboer, the UN's senior climate change official, admitted the deadline had in effect been shelled.
[03:55:30.592 --> 03:55:32.913]  And it goes into how they're just annihilated.
[03:55:32.913 --> 03:55:38.134]  Again, the people know that carbon dioxide that plants breathe is an evil.
[03:55:38.134 --> 03:55:39.914]  They know the government wants a new tax.
[03:55:39.914 --> 03:55:45.396]  They know the new government to be set up on a planetary scale is a private banking consortium.
[03:55:45.396 --> 03:55:48.737]  The problem is, they just want open government power.
[03:55:48.737 --> 03:55:51.237]  We already have the same central banks running our countries.
[03:55:51.237 --> 03:55:58.179]  They just wanted a new, more intensified scam, where they actually have the government power, not just through government have the power.
[03:56:00.655 --> 03:56:02.836]  So we've got to defeat that.
[03:56:02.836 --> 03:56:05.978]  But everybody should celebrate this upcoming weekend.
[03:56:05.978 --> 03:56:10.701]  You know, toast your iced tea or whatever when you're at dinner.
[03:56:10.701 --> 03:56:12.262]  That we did it.
[03:56:12.262 --> 03:56:14.283]  We shot down Copenhagen.
[03:56:14.283 --> 03:56:16.784]  We shot down Coakley.
[03:56:16.784 --> 03:56:19.226]  We are shooting down the government health care bill.
[03:56:19.226 --> 03:56:21.607]  It is very close to being defeated.
[03:56:21.607 --> 03:56:24.428]  Democrats are saying they're not going to vote for it now.
[03:56:24.428 --> 03:56:27.650]  But the Republicans are saying, oh, we'll do a compromise.
[03:56:27.650 --> 03:56:28.651]  Just get rid of abortion.
[03:56:29.798 --> 03:56:39.381]  So, you better concentrate on those Republicans, the few that voted for it, and the, quote, conservative Democrats, and say no.
[03:56:39.381 --> 03:56:41.022]  Healthcare isn't broken.
[03:56:41.022 --> 03:56:44.383]  You got 25 million people that are uninsured through charity care.
[03:56:44.383 --> 03:56:46.083]  They already get care.
[03:56:46.083 --> 03:56:47.984]  That's another lie, as Ron Paul has said.
[03:56:47.984 --> 03:56:49.004]  It's all a fraud!
[03:56:49.004 --> 03:56:55.747]  A video editor six years ago, self-employed,
[03:56:56.792 --> 03:56:58.433]  He had to have a surgery.
[03:56:58.433 --> 03:56:59.873]  Austin told him, go ahead and die.
[03:56:59.873 --> 03:57:09.798]  I told him, here's the real rules on charity care, and he ended up getting a twenty-something thousand dollar surgery, and everything got fixed for free!
[03:57:09.798 --> 03:57:11.659]  The illegal aliens all get it!
[03:57:11.659 --> 03:57:12.799]  They just don't want you knowing.
[03:57:12.799 --> 03:57:15.901]  That's a little goody that's reserved to the illegal aliens.
[03:57:15.901 --> 03:57:18.422]  My dad does about 30% of his dental care charity.
[03:57:19.397 --> 03:57:23.501]  When you go to medical school, they tell you, you're going to do 30% of your healthcare's charity.
[03:57:23.501 --> 03:57:24.882]  You understand?
[03:57:24.882 --> 03:57:30.388]  But see, doctors have had their own power taken away by HMOs, by healthcare companies who don't want that.
[03:57:30.388 --> 03:57:34.772]  They want to take it from taxpayers and do it.
[03:57:34.772 --> 03:57:37.015]  Little kids that need heart surgery don't go without it.
[03:57:37.015 --> 03:57:38.977]  It's all a lie.
[03:57:38.977 --> 03:57:41.279]  But it is the illegal aliens bankrupting our system.
[03:57:44.209 --> 03:57:50.273]  Because they come here, they have anchor babies, they get on four or five different welfare checks, their baby's a U.S.
[03:57:50.273 --> 03:57:54.095]  citizen and it's over, and citizens get in trouble.
[03:57:54.095 --> 03:57:57.337]  If we do that, they should get in trouble, and that's one of the biggest issues.
[03:57:59.059 --> 03:58:00.681]  It was a bunch of other news I didn't get to.
[03:58:00.681 --> 03:58:04.424]  Retransmission starts now at a powerful first hour.
[03:58:04.424 --> 03:58:06.526]  Covered a lot of key news we haven't gotten to in this hour.
[03:58:06.526 --> 03:58:08.508]  And we'll be back tomorrow, of course, 11 a.m.
[03:58:08.508 --> 03:58:10.410]  and back Sunday, 4 to 6 p.m.
[03:58:10.410 --> 03:58:15.195]  We'll know more tomorrow online at InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[03:58:15.195 --> 03:58:21.281]  Our sites are the number one and number two, BiggerThanGlennBeck, BiggerThanRushLimbaugh.com, alternative websites.
[03:58:22.932 --> 03:58:26.214]  But the enemy's really turning the heat up to take over our movement.
[03:58:26.214 --> 03:58:30.437]  Tell everybody you know about InfoWars.com and the free podcast.
[03:58:30.437 --> 03:58:32.658]  Continue to get our stories out to everybody.
[03:58:32.658 --> 03:58:36.641]  The grassroots is in a struggle against the neocons to save the republic.
[03:58:36.641 --> 03:58:38.882]  They want to hijack us and split our throats.
