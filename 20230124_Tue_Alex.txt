[00:00.000 --> 00:10.720]  A new world order, a new world order, a new world order, a new world order, a new world
[00:10.720 --> 00:11.720]  order.
[00:11.720 --> 00:13.600]  To forge a new world order.
[00:13.600 --> 00:17.880]  Defense Secretary Dick Cheney has approved a revised draft of a policy document on the
[00:17.880 --> 00:18.880]  new world order.
[00:18.880 --> 00:23.280]  So we have countries that are respecting the rules and we have countries that are respecting
[00:23.280 --> 00:26.880]  their national interest going beyond the rules.
[00:26.880 --> 00:32.200]  And that is what is happening and we have to take into consideration the world order.
[00:32.200 --> 00:37.640]  Here at WEF I believe we're discussing, there's a lot of discussion about what the new world
[00:37.640 --> 00:38.880]  order will be.
[00:38.880 --> 00:46.000]  I believe perhaps we are at the moment in such a hyper-partisan, hyper-polarized time that
[00:46.000 --> 00:50.880]  we're not going to be able to form that new Helsinki today.
[00:50.880 --> 00:56.680]  I hope this time around, once we're building this new world order or new rules-based order,
[00:56.680 --> 01:00.520]  the voice of the global south and the developing world is included.
[01:00.520 --> 01:09.680]  After Mr Musk took over the Twitter with his freedom of speech absolutism, we are the protectors
[01:09.680 --> 01:12.080]  of freedom of speech as well.
[01:12.080 --> 01:17.600]  But at the same time we cannot accept, for instance, the illegal content online and so
[01:17.600 --> 01:18.600]  on.
[01:18.600 --> 01:20.160]  So our message was clear.
[01:20.160 --> 01:26.400]  We have the rules which have to be complied with and otherwise there will be sanctions.
[01:26.400 --> 01:27.400]  We're in panic mode.
[01:27.400 --> 01:30.560]  The reason the globalists are scared is because you did your due diligence.
[01:30.560 --> 01:31.560]  You did the work.
[01:31.560 --> 01:32.560]  You spread the word.
[01:32.560 --> 01:33.560]  You planted the seeds.
[01:33.560 --> 01:34.560]  You got ridiculed.
[01:34.560 --> 01:35.560]  You got censored.
[01:35.560 --> 01:36.560]  You got attacked.
[01:36.560 --> 01:40.240]  And so now we're in a real fight with the global controllers, all right?
[01:40.240 --> 01:41.520]  I mean, we got their attention.
[01:41.520 --> 01:43.760]  We are beating the hell out of them.
[01:43.760 --> 01:47.880]  We're politically non-violently breaking their ribs, gouging out their eyeballs, pulling
[01:47.880 --> 01:51.000]  out their teeth, slamming their head to concrete, okay?
[01:51.000 --> 01:52.960]  And we come to Psalm 2.
[01:52.960 --> 01:55.640]  Let's look at it.
[01:55.640 --> 02:03.800]  The verse says, Why are the nations in an uproar and the peoples devising a vain thing?
[02:03.800 --> 02:10.640]  The kings of the earth take their stand and the rulers take counsel together against the
[02:10.640 --> 02:18.640]  Lord and against his anointed saying, Let us tear their fetters apart and cast their
[02:18.640 --> 02:21.080]  cords from us.
[02:21.080 --> 02:25.520]  You know when I read that I said, you know, here's the description of the world.
[02:25.520 --> 02:28.320]  The economic forum going on right now.
[02:28.320 --> 02:33.000]  Now, the problem is they got bio weapons labs everywhere.
[02:33.000 --> 02:34.520]  They got nuclear weapons.
[02:34.520 --> 02:39.920]  They got armies of scum that work for them, pedophiles, devil worshipers, degenerates,
[02:39.920 --> 02:43.680]  and they're really thinking about turning it all loose and causing a giant global civil
[02:43.680 --> 02:45.120]  war and a collapse.
[02:45.120 --> 02:48.320]  The good news is they were going to do that regardless.
[02:48.320 --> 02:52.440]  Now we're going to force them to do it on our terms and we're going to win, but I can
[02:52.440 --> 02:56.520]  offer you nothing but hell in the next 10 years.
[02:56.520 --> 02:58.520]  Nothing but absolute hell.
[02:58.520 --> 03:03.680]  So you're not in your bed sucking your thumbs when these people hate.
[03:03.680 --> 03:08.320]  Because if you think getting in a catatonic position like a baby and curling up in a ball
[03:08.320 --> 03:15.240]  is going to protect you, I got news for you, these people are devil worshiping pedophiles
[03:15.240 --> 03:21.320]  and they've got their operatives everywhere who are spiritually ignited and spiritually
[03:21.320 --> 03:26.280]  energized against us and they're in the banks, they're in the police departments, they're
[03:26.280 --> 03:32.440]  in the law firms, they're in the universities, they're in the schools, they're everywhere.
[03:32.440 --> 03:41.520]  Because when you have this type of consolidation, apostasy is much easier when people band together.
[03:41.520 --> 03:46.720]  The whole Tower of Babel episode needs to be understood in the light of Genesis 3.15.
[03:46.720 --> 03:54.520]  The devil in this story is trying to consolidate humanity in open rebellion against God to
[03:54.520 --> 04:00.360]  destroy the holy line, to totally corrupt and demoralize the world so that the promised
[04:00.360 --> 04:06.800]  Messiah who would crush the serpent's head would not be able to come.
[04:06.800 --> 04:14.800]  In one great apostate united system against God, you might call this a new world order.
[04:14.800 --> 04:19.880]  Something like Vladimir Putin has now upset this balance of the new world order that they
[04:19.880 --> 04:23.120]  were trying to achieve by going into Ukraine.
[04:23.120 --> 04:27.720]  The evil people want to run things and I know that people like General Flynn is like
[04:27.720 --> 04:33.200]  kind of what I call a military homage person, I don't mean he's against technology, he
[04:33.200 --> 04:40.120]  thinks it's at a subconscious level a little too worldly to want to be the leader, a little
[04:40.120 --> 04:47.120]  too pushy to come out and it's just not, well it's a little arrogant, it's a little
[04:47.120 --> 04:58.520]  egotistical, no it's not, no it's not, we're going to lead or we're going to die.
[04:58.520 --> 05:14.400]  M4 Wars has made history, you have made history by supporting M4 Wars, the globalist are being
[05:14.400 --> 05:18.900]  defeated on every front and now is the time to not just sit on our laurels because we're
[05:18.900 --> 05:25.080]  winning battles, let's win the war, the information war, there's nothing you can do more important

[06:27.200 --> 06:38.960]  From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[06:38.960 --> 06:45.120]  The doomsday clock was established in the 1950s to warn of the danger of nuclear war.
[06:45.120 --> 06:50.960]  The doomsday clock has been set to 90 seconds to midnight, the closest it has ever been
[06:50.960 --> 06:55.120]  to global annihilation of the planet.
[06:55.120 --> 07:00.680]  The members of the science and security board moved the hands of the doomsday clock forward,
[07:00.680 --> 07:07.320]  largely though not exclusively because of the mounting dangers in the war in Ukraine.
[07:07.320 --> 07:17.040]  We moved the clock forward the closest it has ever been to midnight, it is now 90 seconds
[07:17.040 --> 07:24.120]  to midnight.
[07:24.120 --> 07:27.560]  You know I just wrote the headline for the show that I do minutes before I go live every
[07:27.560 --> 07:35.880]  day saying bombshell must watch Tuesday broadcast, Dr. Peter McCullough in studio, Dr. Michael
[07:35.880 --> 07:41.640]  Yedong is going to be joining us as well, the former chief scientist and vice president
[07:41.640 --> 07:48.440]  of Pfizer saying this is a deliberate depopulation attack with the shots and that really is a
[07:48.440 --> 07:53.440]  huge second and third hour but I actually think currently I might have to change the
[07:53.440 --> 07:59.000]  headline or at least have the sub headline be doomsday clock moved to 90 seconds to midnight,
[07:59.000 --> 08:04.640]  the closest it has ever been to annihilation of the planet and I agree with them moving
[08:04.640 --> 08:13.520]  it the closest it has ever been, this is incredibly dangerous time to be alive and when I get
[08:13.520 --> 08:21.080]  to these escalations ladies and gentlemen it is going to blow you away, so we just covered
[08:21.080 --> 08:29.080]  the doomsday clock, now look at this, Germany to provide Poland approval this week to send
[08:29.080 --> 08:45.160]  thousands of heavy battle tanks into Ukraine, think about that ladies and gentlemen, thousands
[08:45.160 --> 08:52.920]  of the tanks, leopard two tanks, here is another headline, American lawmakers urge U.S. to
[08:52.920 --> 08:59.360]  ship Abrams frontline battle tanks to Ukraine, Reuters reports that they believe Biden is
[08:59.360 --> 09:03.600]  set to make the announcement by next week and now it is going to happen, as soon as
[09:03.600 --> 09:14.960]  the Germans escalated the rest of the countries will escalate as well, breaking the Biden
[09:14.960 --> 09:23.680]  administration is leaning toward sending a significant number of Abrams M1 tanks to
[09:23.680 --> 09:28.720]  Ukraine and the announcement of deliveries could start this week U.S. official says,
[09:28.720 --> 09:37.360]  excuse me, not next week, this week, got a shocking video of scores of F-16s spinning
[09:37.360 --> 09:44.240]  around in the air in Denmark in an attack exercise on the Russians, let's play that
[09:44.240 --> 10:04.160]  with some audio whenever you guys are ready, foiling for nuclear war and George Soros is
[10:04.160 --> 10:09.200]  crawled out from under his rock or climbed up out of hell, stories up on info wars dot
[10:09.200 --> 10:16.440]  com, George Soros urged use of Eastern European soldiers to reduce the risk of body bags for
[10:16.440 --> 10:26.160]  NATO countries in a new world order article, they say new world order and it goes on and
[10:26.160 --> 10:34.280]  on and on, what does Gerald Salente always say, when all else fails, they take you to
[10:34.280 --> 10:42.680]  war, that's what the globalist five years ago at the EU said, they said, if you try
[10:42.680 --> 10:46.080]  to get rid of the EU or try to get rid of the new world order, we'll just have a major
[10:46.080 --> 10:54.200]  war, that's how they hold us hostage. Meanwhile, here in the United States, it's true, the
[10:54.200 --> 10:58.760]  FBI official investigated Trump ties to Russia was just arrested for illegal ties to Russian
[10:58.760 --> 11:08.720]  oligarch, Hillary Clinton, Barack Obama, all of them, I wouldn't call them Russian spies,
[11:08.720 --> 11:13.000]  but they are as a vending machine, whether you're the chai comms or the Russians or the
[11:13.000 --> 11:19.400]  Saudi Arabians or the Israelis or the British or the Mexicans or the South Africans or
[11:19.400 --> 11:24.280]  any elite that's got money, you just go put your money in and then you get what you want
[11:24.280 --> 11:29.560]  out of the Clinton foundation, the rest of it, but they were particularly hanging off
[11:29.560 --> 11:36.680]  of the Chinese communist teat and then the next biggest one was the Russians, just flooding
[11:36.680 --> 11:42.560]  them with money and that's why when they said Trump was taking Russian money, of course
[11:42.560 --> 11:48.160]  none of it was true, preposterous. Let me tell you something about Trump, for good and
[11:48.160 --> 11:53.640]  bad, you can't get him to do anything you want and you can't get to do it with money.
[11:53.640 --> 11:58.200]  If he wants to do something, he'll take your money and do it, but Trump cannot be bought
[11:58.200 --> 12:02.920]  and that's a well-known thing about Mr. Pighead, because he's definitely wrong about the shots
[12:02.920 --> 12:07.280]  but right on a lot of other stuff, I don't mean that mean I've been pigheaded as well,
[12:07.280 --> 12:11.120]  I've been a jackass as well, that's a good trait when it comes to not being pushed around
[12:11.120 --> 12:15.240]  but it can also be a problem when you won't see the area of your ways, but the idea that
[12:15.240 --> 12:20.160]  I'm a Russian agent or that Trump's a Russian agent or the Republican leadership part is
[12:20.160 --> 12:28.080]  preposterous, there's almost no Russian connections to Republicans, though the media claims that,
[12:28.080 --> 12:35.160]  the Democrats are in a face-lock with them, they are just absolutely intertwined at an
[12:35.160 --> 12:39.400]  incredible level, the only Republican I know that's been taking Russian money is Mitt
[12:39.400 --> 12:44.040]  Romney and he takes Ukrainian money, he's coming up with Democrats, he'll take money
[12:44.040 --> 12:50.560]  from anybody that'll give it to him and now the saying has gone completely and utterly
[12:50.560 --> 12:55.480]  out of control, you know saying Trump's a Russian agent is like saying he's an agent
[12:55.480 --> 12:58.440]  of Kim Jong-un, why do you want a peace deal?
[12:58.440 --> 13:04.760]  He went to Kim Jong-un and showed him a video graphic, it's never been released but it was
[13:04.760 --> 13:12.320]  described as an artist rendering 3D green screen creation, showing North Korea building
[13:12.320 --> 13:18.760]  giant high-rises and golf courses and resorts all up and down its beautiful coastline and
[13:18.760 --> 13:23.440]  allowing his people to be wealthy and for him to be super wealthy and that he explained
[13:23.440 --> 13:27.360]  that the land was so valuable in South Korea and Japan and all around him that he could
[13:27.360 --> 13:32.280]  get trillions of dollars in there to open up for investment, that's exactly how to hit
[13:32.280 --> 13:39.400]  Kim Jong-un, but the Chai comms control Kim Jong-un so they told him no on the deal, but
[13:39.400 --> 13:45.440]  Trump went there and said how about you free your country up and how about you let your
[13:45.440 --> 13:55.640]  people have good jobs in a service economy and reportedly Kim Jong-un began to cry not
[13:55.640 --> 14:00.960]  bawling but like so excited he was crying, he wants to play basketball, he wants to have
[14:00.960 --> 14:06.360]  party, he wants to be famous, he thinks Hollywood school, he watches Disney TV programs, he's
[14:06.360 --> 14:10.960]  a little kid, he's a horrible monster, a horrible dictator but he's been born into
[14:10.960 --> 14:16.800]  a third generation royalty, communist royalty and that's what Trump wanted with the Russians
[14:16.800 --> 14:20.720]  was, you mean they've got the biggest country in the world with more resources than the
[14:20.720 --> 14:28.280]  other continent and the Russian continent is maybe 5% tapped, 95% is untouched, Trump
[14:28.280 --> 14:34.800]  was salivating like a wolf to a giant steak and of course we should be doing business
[14:34.800 --> 14:39.520]  with Russia, of course we should be doing business with North Korea, we should make
[14:39.520 --> 14:44.040]  peace deals, we should go in and have them normalize particularly North Korea and start
[14:44.040 --> 14:55.040]  building as fast as possible a big free market district on the coast and he's the leader,
[14:55.040 --> 15:02.000]  his party of generals that live in shacks basically and have nothing would instantly
[15:02.000 --> 15:06.120]  get behind that, it'd still be some weird communist thing like China but at least there'd
[15:06.120 --> 15:11.440]  be some wealth for the people but no, ladies and gentlemen, the tyrants are prisoners of
[15:11.440 --> 15:15.560]  their own tyranny and that's what's really sick about this and we're on the verge of
[15:15.560 --> 15:21.280]  nuclear war, there's a threat continuum that rank corporation depending on has, we're getting
[15:21.280 --> 15:26.680]  up into the 30s now, the high 30s are limited nuclear war, the low 30s into the world stuff
[15:26.680 --> 15:32.880]  I mean, low 40s, we've talked about this at Nausium but we're just sleepwalking into
[15:32.880 --> 15:39.840]  Armageddon here, okay so we have FBI official investigating Trump ties to Russia, it was
[15:39.840 --> 15:46.280]  just a resident for legal ties to Russian oligarch yesterday, top former FBI counterterrorism
[15:46.280 --> 15:55.080]  official arrested DOJ announces, just up to his eyeballs in rusky money for illegal activity
[15:55.080 --> 15:59.680]  reportedly and it's just, it's insane, the question is why are they now doing this?
[15:59.680 --> 16:04.520]  The second American revolution is happening right now against the new world order and
[16:04.520 --> 16:11.800]  the answer to their 1984 tyranny is the 1776 mindset and infot wars embodies that fight
[16:11.800 --> 16:16.360]  for human liberty against globalist tyranny, now in the last year we've done a very successful

[16:49.480 --> 16:56.160]  a fundraiser but despite that we're offering $30 off exclusively at 1776 on what coins

[18:06.880 --> 18:11.440]  told you but it's not true, they told you we were going to be shut down, they told
[18:11.440 --> 18:15.520]  you we owed a billion and a half dollars, none of that's true, it's all being appealed,
[18:15.520 --> 18:20.120]  they want you to think infowars is dead but if you simply stand up and support infowars,
[18:20.120 --> 18:24.680]  we've got years and years of appeals and we will not be taken off the air but if they
[18:24.680 --> 18:28.160]  can convince you that we've been shut down, they're going to win.
[18:28.160 --> 18:32.480]  Don't let the globalist sigh up you and your family, go to infowarstore.com and get incredible
[18:32.480 --> 18:37.120]  products, supplements, books, films, t-shirts, you name it, then fund the info war and empower

[18:47.120 --> 18:51.480]  people that can take us off the air is you, the viewers and listeners, the majority of

[18:55.680 --> 19:01.320]  you, go to infowarstore.com and keep us on the air.
[19:01.320 --> 19:08.560]  Cover commander here with an important message to humanity, I have decided that all of you

[19:16.120 --> 19:26.000]  and so, I need all of you to stay indoors for the next 15 days to flatten the cans.
[19:26.000 --> 19:34.680]  I also need you to wear masks and I also need you to only shop at mega corporations, that
[19:34.680 --> 19:41.560]  way we can consolidate control and bankrupt the world economy, leaving companies that
[19:41.560 --> 19:50.720]  only I own profitable, you will then be my slaves, oh and then you get that special shot
[19:50.720 --> 19:55.960]  of freedom from copra, it will remove your immune system, so you will be dependent on
[19:55.960 --> 20:02.160]  me for the rest of your miserable lives.
[20:02.160 --> 20:08.120]  Reading of frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[20:32.160 --> 20:40.200]  Ladies and gentlemen, the developments are coming fast and furious.
[20:40.200 --> 20:48.480]  Right now, we just covered how a former top FBI counterterrorism official that ran the
[20:48.480 --> 21:03.320]  Russian gate investigation on Trump has been arrested for being engaged in espionage with
[21:03.320 --> 21:07.400]  the Russians.
[21:07.400 --> 21:12.960]  That happened yesterday and now what I thought was happening is happening.
[21:12.960 --> 21:17.360]  I said a couple of weeks ago when this Biden classified document thing started that it
[21:17.360 --> 21:23.480]  was well known that in the deep state circles, they don't enforce any laws on each other
[21:23.480 --> 21:29.280]  and they all just basically share classified document insider trading information constantly
[21:29.280 --> 21:33.360]  and that's why they want to get into government and get into power is to sell America out,
[21:33.360 --> 21:38.360]  that's all they've been doing for 60 years.
[21:38.360 --> 21:42.760]  So I said, now they've gone after Trump for legally having documents, only the president
[21:42.760 --> 21:48.720]  can do that, no evidence he was selling information, ever anywhere, contrary to this group.
[21:48.720 --> 21:54.720]  So they go after him and that's the deep state, the bureaucracy with its own branch of government,
[21:54.720 --> 21:59.720]  the permanent state, the deep state, flexing its muscles and power and control.
[21:59.720 --> 22:04.240]  When they went after Biden, I said, you're going to see more and more of this, this is
[22:04.240 --> 22:09.120]  the permanent deep state, not just wanting to have figurehead presidents but wanting
[22:09.120 --> 22:14.840]  to have full control, an actual dictatorship of the intelligence agencies and the Justice
[22:14.840 --> 22:23.480]  Department and I said look for more of this now.
[22:23.480 --> 22:29.880]  The bureaucrats were setting up Trump, even though he had the power to do it and Biden
[22:29.880 --> 22:35.800]  who was there selling the documents and now Mike Pence, classified documents found in
[22:35.800 --> 22:50.000]  Mike Pence's Indiana home and then that way they can basically have all the big contenders
[22:50.000 --> 22:54.880]  under their control, so you play ball with them.
[22:54.880 --> 22:59.440]  A small number of classified documents were found in former Vice President Pence's personal
[22:59.440 --> 23:04.120]  residence in Indiana or this month according to reports, Pence officials found two boxes
[23:04.120 --> 23:08.120]  of possible classified materials inside the home on January 18th as well as another two
[23:08.120 --> 23:12.640]  boxes that could take copies of Vice Presidential papers according to Fox News.
[23:12.640 --> 23:15.680]  The Vice President's team notified the National Archives and Records Administration upon the
[23:15.680 --> 23:20.800]  discovery, officials said the N-A-R-A that informed the FBI was to conduct its standard
[23:20.800 --> 23:24.840]  procedure investigation.
[23:24.840 --> 23:30.280]  So it's the bureaucrats all running around looking for anything they can claim is classified
[23:30.280 --> 23:35.360]  and any briefing, any off-record discussion is highly classified in the White House.
[23:35.360 --> 23:42.800]  So basically everything is, emails Vice President sent to the President, all that stuff and
[23:42.800 --> 23:46.680]  then later that's always been kept, that's always been used, but now no, no, no, no,
[23:46.680 --> 23:56.680]  it's classified fetishizing the permanent, deep state debt the world is living under.
[23:56.680 --> 24:00.320]  So the headline on Infowars.com is very, very important, I hope you share the live show
[24:00.320 --> 24:01.320]  feed article.
[24:01.320 --> 24:06.200]  Doomsday Clock moves closer to midnight than ever before as experts across the globe expose
[24:06.200 --> 24:12.880]  the killer COVID jabs, Dr. Peter McCullough in studio in the third hour, Dr. Michael
[24:12.880 --> 24:17.800]  Yedon, first time he's been on with us, it's going to be huge.
[24:17.800 --> 24:24.320]  Former head of the vaccine program at Pfizer and the Vice President, this is going to be
[24:24.320 --> 24:33.560]  a massive interview with him coming up in just about 36 minutes from now in hour number
[24:33.560 --> 24:34.560]  two.
[24:34.560 --> 24:38.800]  Now, I'm going to continue with the rest of the news and there's a lot of it with them
[24:38.800 --> 24:43.600]  cutting off our energy supplies and what's really happening there, there is a ton of
[24:43.600 --> 24:48.040]  news on global birth rates and Japan's sign of the alarm that their society is going to
[24:48.040 --> 24:52.280]  collapse but they don't have more children.
[24:52.280 --> 24:57.560]  Biden has tried to introduce a new assault weapons man, he says he's going to introduce
[24:57.560 --> 24:58.560]  eminently.
[24:58.560 --> 25:03.320]  I saw the bill last week and talked about it but now she's gone on TV and shed what's
[25:03.320 --> 25:04.320]  in the bill.
[25:04.320 --> 25:07.560]  People said, oh, that can't be Alex when we read the headline and read the article but
[25:07.560 --> 25:08.560]  here it is.
[25:08.560 --> 25:11.760]  We got the video coming up.
[25:11.760 --> 25:12.760]  Video.
[25:12.760 --> 25:18.320]  Dim, Rep, Lodge bill to make it criminal for white people to criticize non-white people
[25:18.320 --> 25:25.320]  in any way, total political correctness and you saw the deputy head of the EU say soon
[25:25.320 --> 25:31.080]  your Americans will ban all speech, right?
[25:31.080 --> 25:37.080]  The Republican congressman on the stage, one of the Jan 6 traitors against America sat
[25:37.080 --> 25:44.800]  up there and nodded his head like a seal that had just been given a fish.
[25:44.800 --> 25:45.800]  It's incredible.
[25:45.800 --> 25:51.760]  I also get into temperatures in northern hemisphere due to fall over the next 25 years
[25:51.760 --> 25:57.120]  according to six top international scientists who have already made these predictions in
[25:57.120 --> 26:00.560]  the last 10 that they would begin to drop and the temperature has indeed been dropping
[26:00.560 --> 26:01.960]  now for the last 10 years.
[26:01.960 --> 26:06.880]  It did peak about 15 years ago in the modern era.
[26:06.880 --> 26:10.080]  It's obviously been much, much hotter previously.
[26:10.080 --> 26:11.080]  All right.
[26:11.080 --> 26:18.880]  We're going to go to break, come back and go over all of that in great detail and more.
[26:18.880 --> 26:28.120]  But first, sold out again for over two years, back already a best seller, reformulated.

[27:07.720 --> 27:13.120]  that we've ever offered with even better ingredients, Ultimate Bone Broth Plus.

[31:53.280 --> 31:59.640]  The globalists are counting on you, not taking action.
[31:59.640 --> 32:06.680]  In the year 2000, Alex Jones' film Dark Secrets Inside Bohemian Grove showed the world how
[32:06.680 --> 32:12.560]  our so-called elite leaders practice mock ritual sacrifices in private.
[32:12.560 --> 32:21.480]  In 2007, Alex Jones releases Endgame, exposing the world elite's plans for covertly using
[32:21.480 --> 32:25.240]  biological weapons against all of mankind.
[32:25.240 --> 32:31.720]  And by the time they launched their attack in 2020, Alex Jones' InfoWars and our audience
[32:31.720 --> 32:37.160]  were there to warn the people of the deadly vaccines that we knew were coming.
[32:37.160 --> 32:39.200]  This is why they attack us.
[32:39.200 --> 32:45.800]  This is why we need your support, because we tell the truth, Alex Jones was right.

[32:52.200 --> 33:17.840]  fight for freedom and help us defeat the New World Order.
[33:17.840 --> 33:39.640]  Well, it's not just Trump, it's not just old Biden, now Vice President Pence discovered
[33:39.640 --> 33:43.360]  classified documents in his home.
[33:43.360 --> 33:48.560]  The FBI's investigating Pence's deep state as it gets, we now know that in hindsight,
[33:48.560 --> 33:55.200]  we always had our suspicions, but he's also doing that to pull heat off of Biden.
[33:55.200 --> 33:57.760]  He's the one that reported it on himself.
[33:57.760 --> 34:03.080]  This is just par for the course with these people.
[34:03.080 --> 34:07.120]  Now, let's move into this area of news.
[34:07.120 --> 34:12.480]  I've got a whole bunch of clips I want to get to, but look at these headlines.
[34:12.480 --> 34:19.520]  Bill Gates flies around Australia on a $70 million private jet, one of 10 eons, lecturing
[34:19.520 --> 34:24.360]  people about climate change and saying they've got to give up their cows, sheep, cars, and
[34:24.360 --> 34:26.760]  don't have children.
[34:26.760 --> 34:33.320]  Continuing, White House Secretary says House Republicans are using their narrow majority
[34:33.320 --> 34:38.480]  to force American people to pay higher gas prices when he cut off the pipelines and,
[34:38.480 --> 34:41.680]  you know, all the rest of it to sold the strategic oil reserve.
[34:41.680 --> 34:47.000]  Meanwhile, WEF chauffeur admits VIP elites refuse to ride in electric cars, demand the
[34:47.000 --> 34:50.640]  biggest gas guzzlers.
[34:50.640 --> 34:52.840]  They love their hypocrisy.
[34:52.840 --> 34:57.200]  Let's just play these clips, there's a lot of them, back to back.
[34:57.200 --> 35:02.760]  This is Greta Thunberg asking Davis if she'll protest Russia and Saudi Arabian oil, she
[35:02.760 --> 35:06.720]  will only protest European oil, it's part of the energy crackdown, and the White House
[35:06.720 --> 35:12.120]  Press Secretary saying the thing I just said that the Republicans are behind the higher
[35:12.120 --> 35:17.360]  gas prices, and then the same idiot saying it's a non-issue that Biden sold US oil reserves
[35:17.360 --> 35:22.120]  to communist China instead of to US refineries that would have lowered prices.
[35:22.120 --> 35:25.320]  Let's play a clip two, three, and four, back to back.
[35:25.320 --> 35:30.800]  Never protest Saudi Arabia or Russia, you only protest Western energy.
[35:30.800 --> 35:34.400]  Why have you never criticized Vladimir Putin or OPEC?
[35:34.400 --> 35:37.120]  Yeah, I've never done that, never ever.
[35:37.120 --> 35:45.640]  Well, will you do so now, will you condemn OPEC energy?
[35:45.640 --> 35:50.440]  The President spent the last two years, as you know, doing everything he could to lower
[35:50.440 --> 35:57.520]  gas prices for American families, and prices are down about $1.60 a gallon since last summer.
[35:57.520 --> 36:02.880]  Now, House Republicans are using their narrow majority to force the American people to pay
[36:02.880 --> 36:08.880]  higher gas prices just as big oil companies are amassing record profits.
[36:08.880 --> 36:14.880]  The House has passed bipartisan legislation that would ban the export of oil from the
[36:14.880 --> 36:21.120]  Strategic Petroleum Reserve to Chinese companies, given that oil has flowed to China from that
[36:21.120 --> 36:24.360]  reserve during both this administration and the previous one.
[36:24.360 --> 36:28.120]  Is that the type of reform that the President would potentially support?
[36:28.120 --> 36:33.080]  So look, I think this is a little bit of what the Secretary was talking about just moments
[36:33.080 --> 36:34.080]  ago.
[36:34.080 --> 36:39.040]  This bill addresses a non-issue, we're very clear on that.
[36:39.040 --> 36:44.080]  Whether you're in Canada, the US, Europe, the UK, Australia, New Zealand, they're cutting
[36:44.080 --> 36:49.720]  the power off everywhere, and they're shutting down the coal power plants that produce almost
[36:49.720 --> 36:50.720]  all the energy.
[36:50.720 --> 36:53.840]  And I saw a report of Bill Gates in Australia a few days ago, we didn't have time to play
[36:53.840 --> 36:54.840]  it.
[36:54.840 --> 36:58.360]  But they said, but Bill Gates is here to save you, yes, we know your energy prices have
[36:58.360 --> 37:04.680]  tripled the last five, six years, and it's killing people's livelihoods, but it's okay.
[37:04.680 --> 37:09.080]  We're putting price caps on coal, so they can't gouge you for the few coal power plants
[37:09.080 --> 37:10.080]  that are left.
[37:10.080 --> 37:12.000]  That'll just bankrupt them.
[37:12.000 --> 37:17.160]  They always pointed to coal power plant at night in the cold weather and say, look how
[37:17.160 --> 37:23.440]  toxic it is, it's hot air coming out with only carbon dioxide and water vapor, and in
[37:23.440 --> 37:28.480]  the freezing, when it's in the winter, it looks hellish, but it's totally clean, unlike
[37:28.480 --> 37:35.240]  China and Mexico and India, where there are no scrubbers, and it is toxic.
[37:35.240 --> 37:36.240]  Let's continue with clip eight.
[37:36.240 --> 37:43.120]  This is Jennifer Granholm, one of the main secretaries Biden has, bizarrely brags about
[37:43.120 --> 37:51.480]  prices at the pump and saying that Biden, this is the energy secretary, has given us
[37:51.480 --> 37:56.960]  better gas prices, even though they're up over a dollar, what they were at their peak
[37:56.960 --> 37:57.960]  with Trump.
[37:57.960 --> 37:58.960]  Here it is.
[37:58.960 --> 38:05.840]  The average price of a gallon of gas is now down about $1.60 from last summer's peak,
[38:05.840 --> 38:09.200]  but a 30% decline.
[38:09.200 --> 38:13.360]  And now let's go ahead and play the other clip of Granholm as well, saying that he's
[38:13.360 --> 38:22.600]  mainly focused Biden on controlling energy prices, you mean jacking them up?
[38:22.600 --> 38:29.360]  You know, President Biden really has been singularly focused on reducing costs for American
[38:29.360 --> 38:36.640]  families, especially energy costs, especially both transportation as well as at home.
[38:36.640 --> 38:45.960]  Now, to take a little bit north to the W.E.F.'s vice leader, she's the real prime minister
[38:45.960 --> 38:56.080]  of Canada, the real leader of Canada, here is Christina Freeland giving a speech saying
[38:56.080 --> 39:01.040]  that the middle class has too much money, and that we need to redistribute it to the
[39:01.040 --> 39:02.040]  poor people.
[39:02.040 --> 39:08.480]  Now, the average poor person generally doesn't have good economics education, but let me
[39:08.480 --> 39:13.640]  explain this, most middle class people don't either, but the elites do.
[39:13.640 --> 39:18.480]  Less than one tenth of 1% has over 70% of the wealth in the world, it's not the 1%.
[39:18.480 --> 39:26.040]  If you make $250,000 a year, even less, like $230,000, you are considered the 1%.
[39:26.040 --> 39:33.280]  All of 99.9% of the 1% and all those below them have 30% or a little more depending on
[39:33.280 --> 39:35.560]  the country of the world's wealth.
[39:35.560 --> 39:41.480]  In 1955, America was 4% of the world's population, we had 56% of the world's wealth, and it
[39:41.480 --> 39:45.240]  was distributed and we had the biggest middle class history had ever seen.
[39:45.240 --> 39:50.960]  A middle class is a ladder up for poor people, and a big middle class is always indicative
[39:50.960 --> 39:55.280]  of the most wealthy successful countries, and it's a product of Europe and a product
[39:55.280 --> 39:59.360]  of Christianity, a product you don't see anywhere else that was then finally exported
[39:59.360 --> 40:04.040]  to the world, that is a countervailing wind to globalism and neofutilism, and making you
[40:04.040 --> 40:09.640]  poor to control you, you'll own nothing, you'll have nothing, you'll like it.
[40:09.640 --> 40:15.360]  But here she is telling the people that, oh, if we get rid of the middle class, people
[40:15.360 --> 40:23.320]  making $70,000 a year, they estimate what they call it, up to about $240,000 a year,
[40:23.320 --> 40:29.200]  if we get rid of them and distribute it to poor people, they'll suddenly have wealth.
[40:29.200 --> 40:32.720]  No, it's the middle class that generates the entrepreneurship and the companies and the
[40:32.720 --> 40:36.400]  small companies and jobs, and every metric and every historical research paper shows
[40:36.400 --> 40:40.200]  that, you don't need to be Milton Friedman to know it.
[40:40.200 --> 40:46.040]  It's a fact, so when you attack the pipelines and attack the industry and attack the energy
[40:46.040 --> 40:51.920]  and attack the family and attack the middle class, and then you don't target the middle
[40:51.920 --> 40:56.320]  class with the giant tax rates, I mean, they did that too, you target the poorest working
[40:56.320 --> 41:07.120]  people and the blue collar folks making $40,000 or less a year, you target them with IRS attack
[41:07.120 --> 41:11.000]  dogs, even though they're a fraction of the tax base.
[41:11.000 --> 41:15.560]  I mean, that's a perfect policy to bankrupt people and make people give up and destroy
[41:15.560 --> 41:20.320]  their lives, just horrible, but it's the same global group trying to give you poison shots
[41:20.320 --> 41:21.320]  and kill your ass.
[41:21.320 --> 41:23.320]  I mean, they really don't like us.
[41:23.320 --> 41:26.960]  They really don't like you, they don't like prosperity, they're horrible people.
[41:26.960 --> 41:34.800]  So here is Christina Freeland selling the total collapse to Canadians and they sell
[41:34.800 --> 41:37.440]  the same thing in universities all over the world.
[41:37.440 --> 41:40.000]  Get rid of the middle class, that's prosperity.
[41:40.000 --> 41:44.720]  Don't raise everybody to a higher standard, lower everyone to a lower standard with a
[41:44.720 --> 41:46.520]  tiny one to the 1% rule in you.
[41:46.520 --> 41:47.520]  Here it is.
[41:47.520 --> 41:51.280]  And this is what he said when I talked to him about what's going on in the American
[41:51.280 --> 41:52.280]  middle class.
[41:52.280 --> 41:57.080]  We demand a higher paycheck than the rest of the world, so if you're going to demand
[41:57.080 --> 42:02.120]  10 times the paycheck, you need to deliver 10 times the value.
[42:02.120 --> 42:08.120]  It sounds harsh, but maybe people in the middle class need to decide to take a pay cut.
[42:08.120 --> 42:14.080]  Again, not untrue if you're looking at the dynamics of the global economy, but politically
[42:14.080 --> 42:18.160]  and socially a very difficult thing.
[42:18.160 --> 42:21.840]  But Bill Gates and Jeff Bezos and the rest of them, they're not going to take pay cuts.
[42:21.840 --> 42:25.840]  They're going to take the most hardcore on record to their employees and screwing their
[42:25.840 --> 42:26.840]  employees.
[42:26.840 --> 42:29.800]  So no, no, no, no, they're not going to stop flying on planes, they're not going to stop
[42:29.800 --> 42:30.800]  having children.
[42:30.800 --> 42:31.800]  You are.
[42:31.800 --> 42:36.680]  And notice he's not just talking about middle class versus working class in America or Canada.
[42:36.680 --> 42:40.120]  She's saying, oh, since people are poor in Africa, you need to be poor.
[42:40.120 --> 42:44.840]  Oh, yeah, if we get real poor and don't buy products from Africa, that'll help them.
[42:44.840 --> 42:48.240]  No, as we get richer, they get richer in a free market system.
[42:48.240 --> 42:49.240]  Everybody knows that.
[42:49.240 --> 42:50.240]  John F. Kennedy knew that.
[42:50.240 --> 42:52.160]  A rising tide raises all ships.
[42:52.160 --> 42:54.880]  She says, no, a lowering tide raises them.
[42:54.880 --> 42:57.680]  That's 1984 level lies.
[42:57.680 --> 43:04.800]  I talk a lot about the great successes and full wars this had.
[43:04.800 --> 43:06.920]  I don't think anybody can deny it.
[43:06.920 --> 43:10.320]  And it is because of listeners and viewers supporting us.
[43:10.320 --> 43:14.240]  When we talk about the crew and info wars, people behind the scenes, the researchers,
[43:14.240 --> 43:19.760]  the writers, they really have been the MVPs in this fight.
[43:19.760 --> 43:24.280]  And we look at Harrison Smith and Owen Schreuer and the hard work they engage in every day,
[43:24.280 --> 43:26.640]  five, six, seven days a week.
[43:26.640 --> 43:28.600]  It's really just incredible.
[43:28.600 --> 43:32.120]  So for myself, the whole info wars crew, I thank you for your past support.
[43:32.120 --> 43:37.080]  I only encourage you now to realize that info wars cannot stay on air if you do not support
[43:37.080 --> 43:38.080]  us.
[43:38.080 --> 43:39.080]  I know you spread the word.
[43:39.080 --> 43:40.080]  I know you pray for us.
[43:40.080 --> 43:41.080]  And that's wonderful.
[43:41.080 --> 43:42.080]  Keep doing it.
[43:42.080 --> 43:46.000]  But most viewers and listeners never go to info wars store.com and you never buy great
[43:46.000 --> 43:47.760]  products that enrich and empower your life.
[43:47.760 --> 43:49.480]  All at the same time, keep us on air.
[43:49.480 --> 43:53.640]  I know that less than 1% of our listeners actually go buy products at info wars store.com.
[43:53.640 --> 43:58.400]  If just 1% more of you took action and went to info wars store.com, our funding problems
[43:58.400 --> 43:59.400]  will be over.
[43:59.400 --> 44:00.400]  Please take action now.
[44:00.400 --> 44:04.720]  Ladies and gentlemen, we are now launching the most powerful supplements in the history
[44:04.720 --> 44:09.880]  of info wars under a new brand name info wars platinum.
[44:09.880 --> 44:14.600]  Now all three of these revolutionary products you see in front of you are already number
[44:14.600 --> 44:19.640]  one best sellers in the market for the last few years because they work so well.
[44:19.640 --> 44:23.680]  We've gone right to the manufacturer who are listeners, the owners of fan, and they've
[44:23.680 --> 44:29.560]  given us this huge deal off of retail, 40% off what these products are found for under
[44:29.560 --> 44:33.160]  other names and not just under one name.
[44:33.160 --> 44:37.760]  They sell these under three or four other brands that other major distributors and suppliers
[44:37.760 --> 44:38.760]  have put out.
[44:38.760 --> 44:43.200]  The difference is we have it for 40% off what it is in stores.
[44:43.200 --> 44:45.080]  We're talking about pain MD.
[44:45.080 --> 44:47.760]  We're talking about HGH max boost.
[44:47.760 --> 44:50.640]  We're talking about 1776 testosterone boost.
[44:50.640 --> 44:52.240]  These things are incredible.
[44:52.240 --> 44:56.320]  I would suggest you take half a dose or less when you first do and consult your healthcare
[44:56.320 --> 45:00.560]  provider, those are so powerful, get them at infowarksstore.com.
[45:00.560 --> 45:03.120]  It's a post COVID world now.
[45:03.120 --> 45:06.880]  Americans have lost trust in their doctors and the healthcare system.

[47:02.080 --> 47:06.400]  a frontal assault on the lies of the new world order.
[47:06.400 --> 47:22.200]  It's Alex Jones.
[47:22.200 --> 47:44.540]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones show Dr. Michael Yeadoff, the former head of the science division,
[47:44.540 --> 47:50.760]  the vaccine division of Pfizer, vice president, gonna be joining us for the first time coming
[47:50.760 --> 47:56.020]  up next hour than in studio Dr. Peter McCullough and I know listeners know it's a poison, you
[47:56.020 --> 48:01.920]  know it's an attack, you know they suppress the therapeutics, you know all that.
[48:01.920 --> 48:06.060]  But now we're talking about prosecuting these people and the criminal investigations happening
[48:06.060 --> 48:10.380]  around the world and the vindication as Elon Musk and everybody else comes out and says
[48:10.380 --> 48:16.220]  it made me sick, it made my family sick, it's killing all these people.
[48:16.220 --> 48:21.660]  Now we're really supposed to push the truth and all the latest information because the
[48:21.660 --> 48:30.500]  globalist are betting on manufactured plagues as a pretext to bring in this total control.
[48:30.500 --> 48:36.660]  So a big second and third hour and fourth hour coming up today and also interspersed
[48:36.660 --> 48:38.260]  a lot of breaking news and information.
[48:38.260 --> 48:43.900]  Okay, about a week ago I saw the bill, I saw the article in info wars and I thought this
[48:43.900 --> 48:47.620]  has got to be fake, even though I knew it was coming, it's just still unbelievable.
[48:47.620 --> 48:54.500]  And sure enough once the bill itself and it said it, any criticism of a person that has
[48:54.500 --> 49:01.820]  dark skin on any issue is a serious federal crime under this legislation.
[49:01.820 --> 49:03.980]  You're like well that'll never pass, they're crazy.
[49:03.980 --> 49:07.780]  Look at the EU deputy head saying soon we'll be in speech in America and laughing and the
[49:07.780 --> 49:10.500]  Americans with them laughing on the stage.
[49:10.500 --> 49:20.220]  Except for villains in a Dr. Evil movie, I guess Dr. Evil in a Austin Powers movie, Michael
[49:20.220 --> 49:26.780]  Myers movie, it's just insane and anybody can read the bill but what about actually
[49:26.780 --> 49:36.100]  seeing the people from Congress on TV promoting this and that's what they're saying, oh five
[49:36.100 --> 49:39.460]  million dollars to all the black people, you're never going to get that five million dollars.
[49:39.460 --> 49:42.780]  Just like Biden said oh vote me in and he still had to steal it but he got some votes
[49:42.780 --> 49:43.780]  out of it.
[49:43.780 --> 49:49.380]  I'll give you free education, all your student debts will be forgiven and then he took it
[49:49.380 --> 49:50.380]  back.
[49:50.380 --> 49:53.860]  They're not going to give five million dollars to black people a piece.
[49:53.860 --> 49:58.340]  Oh I'm sure if you get sterilized and go on a universal basic income they'll say well
[49:58.340 --> 50:03.740]  under the universal basic income you're 25 years old, you'll live to 75 on average, that's
[50:03.740 --> 50:05.740]  five million dollars.
[50:05.740 --> 50:07.260]  That's what they're actually proposing.
[50:07.260 --> 50:11.100]  But it's another form of welfare, not enough to even live and then you've got to do everything
[50:11.100 --> 50:14.980]  they tell you to do and you're like oh but it's my free money, I'm going to put these
[50:14.980 --> 50:17.620]  chains on.
[50:17.620 --> 50:24.220]  So video, dim rep laud's bill to make it criminal for white people to criticize non-white people
[50:24.220 --> 50:26.620]  and they're introduced in crap like this in Europe too.
[50:26.620 --> 50:31.460]  Democrat representative Sheila Jackson Lee said Monday that Tucker Carlson could be the
[50:31.460 --> 50:36.860]  first to be prosecuted under legislation she has introduced that would see any white person
[50:36.860 --> 50:40.980]  talking about replacement theory be criminalized and what did the ADL say about me two years
[50:40.980 --> 50:43.460]  ago at their award ceremony.
[50:43.460 --> 50:49.620]  They said we want Alex Jones and Mark Zuckerberg arrested for their speech, if Mark Zuckerberg
[50:49.620 --> 50:55.180]  doesn't do what we say we want him arrested, we want him put in prison and we want anybody
[50:55.180 --> 51:00.900]  that talks about replacement migration theory even though it's a UN policy should be arrested
[51:00.900 --> 51:07.900]  and that's just where it begins but the bill says anything.
[51:07.900 --> 51:10.100]  So let's go ahead and roll a segment of that clip.
[51:10.100 --> 51:14.460]  Joining me now is Congresswoman Sheila Jackson Lee of Texas and Congresswoman I want to zero
[51:14.460 --> 51:21.780]  in on exactly that point because people, let me read from the law a little bit, it talks
[51:21.780 --> 51:26.740]  about being able to prosecute a person who engages in a conspiracy to engage in white
[51:26.740 --> 51:32.420]  supremacy inspired hate crimes, this conspiracy shall be determined to exist between two or
[51:32.420 --> 51:37.260]  more persons at least one of whom published material advancing white supremacy, white
[51:37.260 --> 51:42.940]  supremacist ideology antagonism based on replacement theory or hate speech that vilifies or otherwise
[51:42.940 --> 51:48.260]  directed against a non-white person or group and they're saying that a reasonable person
[51:48.260 --> 51:53.420]  would be able to determine whether that speech motivated actions by a person who commits a
[51:53.420 --> 51:54.980]  violent crime.
[51:54.980 --> 52:01.260]  I think that is why Tucker Carlson is upset about the law because he is one of the people
[52:01.260 --> 52:04.020]  who promotes white supremacist ideology.
[52:04.020 --> 52:09.820]  Does this bill allow potential prosecution of people like Tucker Carlson?
[52:09.820 --> 52:14.700]  First of all, thank you so very much for having me.
[52:14.700 --> 52:18.220]  The bill has nothing to do with speech.
[52:18.220 --> 52:22.460]  You know, I was thinking about the Pledge of Allegiance and it said justice and equality
[52:22.460 --> 52:29.700]  for all and I would offer to say that everyone deserves justice and equality.
[52:29.700 --> 52:35.300]  It seems that the right way extremists, the violent extremists don't want that to happen.
[52:35.300 --> 52:37.380]  This does not criminalize speech.
[52:37.380 --> 52:38.700]  It is a crime bill.
[52:38.700 --> 52:44.780]  It is a criminal law bill which means that intent would have to be proved that what generated
[52:44.780 --> 52:50.460]  out of that speech or your intent was to provoke someone to violence and that a violent act
[52:50.460 --> 53:02.380]  did occur up Mr. Carlson or anyone else chooses to speak in ugly terms, his speech is protected.
[53:02.380 --> 53:08.340]  It also is not a guarantee that white supremacy is promoted only by people who happen to be
[53:08.340 --> 53:09.340]  Caucasian.
[53:09.340 --> 53:10.980]  It is a philosophy.
[53:10.980 --> 53:15.460]  It is a philosophy and the point of view of that Director Ray has spoken about now for
[53:15.460 --> 53:20.700]  almost three years that white supremacy is the largest part of domestic terrorism and
[53:20.700 --> 53:25.460]  domestic terrorism is larger than our fears of years back of al-Qaeda.
[53:25.460 --> 53:29.940]  I only need to make sure that we had a bill that addressed that.
[53:29.940 --> 53:32.980]  Okay, so translated, yes it goes after your speech.
[53:32.980 --> 53:34.340]  They just showed the bill on screen.
[53:34.340 --> 53:37.220]  So the host gets it right and loves its anti-free speech.
[53:37.220 --> 53:41.580]  Oh, if I say something and then some person does something and they say it's because I
[53:41.580 --> 53:44.060]  influenced them, I go to jail.
[53:44.060 --> 53:49.420]  It's all protected speech and you notice they've branded all of this in the last few years
[53:49.420 --> 53:53.980]  with the FBI that the number one threats white supremacy, even though it's not true, they've
[53:53.980 --> 54:02.660]  branded that everywhere as questioning open borders or shots or forced injections.
[54:02.660 --> 54:05.060]  Any of it, they're now calling white supremacism.
[54:05.060 --> 54:07.980]  That's a huge shift they're engaged in.
[54:07.980 --> 54:10.380]  So she's trying to sneak this legislation through.
[54:10.380 --> 54:13.380]  But let's look at this real quick.
[54:13.380 --> 54:17.940]  We're not going to hear much about the 10 people and 16 injured at the Asian night club
[54:17.940 --> 54:18.940]  in Los Angeles.
[54:18.940 --> 54:19.940]  You know why?
[54:19.940 --> 54:21.420]  Overhead shot, please.
[54:21.420 --> 54:27.660]  Because it turns out it was an old Asian man who went in and shot the people and it
[54:27.660 --> 54:32.060]  was another individual who ended up disarming him.
[54:32.060 --> 54:38.380]  So you're not going to hear about that because it's not going to be listed as a hate crime.
[54:38.380 --> 54:42.340]  Well, all these crimes are hateful and in a matter of Asian shoot Asians or white shoot
[54:42.340 --> 54:46.340]  whites or black shoot blacks or white shoot blacks or black shoot whites, it's all the
[54:46.340 --> 54:47.340]  same damn thing.
[54:47.340 --> 54:52.460]  If you kill some innocent person, you get in trouble for it, you go to prison for it.
[54:52.460 --> 54:58.100]  But all over the country, these George Soros operatives that they put in as the county
[54:58.100 --> 55:02.820]  attorneys and district attorneys and state attorney generals are not prosecuting black
[55:02.820 --> 55:04.660]  on white crime and things like that.
[55:04.660 --> 55:06.780]  And it's simply crazy.
[55:06.780 --> 55:10.860]  All of this crime, when it's cut and dry, should be prosecuted.
[55:10.860 --> 55:14.100]  Here's the photo of the white supremacist.
[55:14.100 --> 55:19.540]  Here's the image for TV viewers of the white supremacist, a 61-year-old Asian man wearing
[55:19.540 --> 55:25.420]  a ski hat, a winter hat, clown world, ladies and gentlemen.
[55:25.420 --> 55:26.980]  Oh, but don't worry.
[55:26.980 --> 55:30.100]  She says it's not just white people who are going to be charged with a hate speech or
[55:30.100 --> 55:33.620]  the hate crime for their speech.
[55:33.620 --> 55:36.940]  Calls grow to band rapper Ye from Australia over hate speech.
[55:36.940 --> 55:38.980]  His wife's from there, his new wife.
[55:38.980 --> 55:45.020]  He's trying to go there and visit his family, his new in-laws, and they're saying no.
[55:45.020 --> 55:47.140]  So they can define hate speech as whatever they want.
[55:47.140 --> 55:50.700]  You can say what Ye said about liking Hitler.
[55:50.700 --> 55:51.860]  I mean, I don't agree with it.
[55:51.860 --> 55:54.700]  I get he says love everybody, but I don't agree with that, but he shouldn't be banned
[55:54.700 --> 55:56.700]  for being shocking.
[55:56.700 --> 55:58.340]  He doesn't have a criminal record.
[55:58.340 --> 56:02.180]  He's not a bad person in his actions, physical actions.
[56:02.180 --> 56:08.580]  But that's where they want this to go is the global social credit score, where what you
[56:08.580 --> 56:12.260]  say and what you do affects where you can travel and your everyday life.
[56:12.260 --> 56:13.260]  All right.
[56:13.260 --> 56:16.900]  I've got a very exciting announcement to make here, and I'm not going to belabor this.
[56:16.900 --> 56:21.220]  You've got a big guest coming up, but it was one of our top five best-selling products.
[56:21.220 --> 56:22.860]  This is supply chain breakdowns.
[56:22.860 --> 56:25.260]  Then it will get it for over two and a half years.
[56:25.260 --> 56:27.500]  We reformulated it and made it even better.
[56:27.500 --> 56:30.580]  Ultimate bone broth plus primal human nutrition.
[56:30.580 --> 56:33.900]  The best bone broth out there, hands down, I challenge you to find better.

[56:36.580 --> 56:40.220]  body is on average the same price as this.
[56:40.220 --> 56:43.020]  They have premium brands that sell for 30, 40% more.
[56:43.020 --> 56:44.580]  This is the ultimate premium brand.
[56:44.580 --> 56:48.860]  This is just have concentrated chicken bone broth or turmeric root or chaga mushroom or
[56:48.860 --> 56:53.020]  bee pollen or goji berry or alfalfa, herb powder, all the incredible things that does.
[56:53.020 --> 56:58.220]  It's got five grams of organic soluble acacia fiber to support digestive help, 400 milligrams

[57:10.180 --> 57:13.780]  the flavoring with natural chocolate flavor and a touch of sea salt.

[57:32.980 --> 57:35.780]  and it's finally back, a game changer.
[57:35.780 --> 57:38.500]  Bone broth Plus.

[57:49.900 --> 57:56.260]  In early 2022, Info Wars launched a very important fundraiser that kept us on air.
[57:56.260 --> 58:01.700]  Your support of that fundraiser is the reason we are still here today fighting the globalist
[58:01.700 --> 58:04.540]  and having incredibly successful results.
[58:04.540 --> 58:06.780]  So I thank you for your pass for support.

[59:30.220 --> 59:31.220]  They're all different formulas.

[59:51.460 --> 59:58.100]  Getting a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[59:58.100 --> 01:00:02.800]  A New World Order.
[01:00:02.800 --> 01:00:04.100]  A New World Order.
[01:00:04.100 --> 01:00:06.100]  A New World Order.
[01:00:06.100 --> 01:00:08.260]  A New World Order.
[01:00:08.260 --> 01:00:10.380]  A New World Order.
[01:00:10.380 --> 01:00:13.060]  To forge a New World Order.
[01:00:13.060 --> 01:00:17.100]  Defense Secretary Dick Cheney has approved a revised draft of a policy document on the
[01:00:17.100 --> 01:00:18.360]  New World Order.
[01:00:18.360 --> 01:00:22.500]  So we have countries that are respecting the rules and we have countries that are respecting
[01:00:22.500 --> 01:00:26.100]  their national interest going beyond the rules.
[01:00:26.100 --> 01:00:31.380]  And that is what is happening and we have to take into consideration the World Order.
[01:00:31.380 --> 01:00:36.820]  Here at WEF I believe we're discussing, there's a lot of discussion about what the New World
[01:00:36.820 --> 01:00:38.060]  Order will be.
[01:00:38.060 --> 01:00:44.980]  I believe perhaps we are at the moment in such a hyper-partisan, hyper-polarized time
[01:00:44.980 --> 01:00:50.060]  that we're not going to be able to form that new Helsinki today.
[01:00:50.060 --> 01:00:55.860]  I hope this time round, once we're building this New World Order or new rules-based order,
[01:00:55.860 --> 01:00:59.740]  the voice of the global south and the developing world is included.
[01:00:59.740 --> 01:01:08.820]  After Mr Musk took over the Twitter with his freedom of speech absolutism, we are the protectors
[01:01:08.820 --> 01:01:11.220]  of freedom of speech as well.
[01:01:11.220 --> 01:01:16.780]  But at the same time we cannot accept, for instance, the illegal content online and so
[01:01:16.780 --> 01:01:17.780]  on.
[01:01:17.780 --> 01:01:24.220]  So our message was clear, we have the rules which have to be complied with and otherwise
[01:01:24.220 --> 01:01:25.220]  there will be sanctions.
[01:01:25.220 --> 01:01:26.220]  They're in panic mode.
[01:01:26.220 --> 01:01:30.460]  The reason the globalists are scared is because you did your due diligence, you did the work,
[01:01:30.460 --> 01:01:34.220]  you spread the word, you planted the seeds, you got ridiculed, you got censored, you got
[01:01:34.220 --> 01:01:35.220]  attacked.
[01:01:35.220 --> 01:01:39.460]  And so now we're in a real fight with the global controllers, all right?
[01:01:39.460 --> 01:01:43.020]  I mean, we got their attention, we are beating the hell out of them.
[01:01:43.020 --> 01:01:47.140]  We're politically non-violently breaking their ribs, gouging out their eyeballs, pulling
[01:01:47.140 --> 01:01:50.260]  out their teeth, slamming their head to concrete, okay?
[01:01:50.260 --> 01:01:54.900]  And we come to Psalm 2, let's look at it.
[01:01:54.900 --> 01:02:03.040]  The verse says, why are the nations in an uproar and the peoples devising a vain thing?
[01:02:03.040 --> 01:02:09.860]  The kings of the earth take their stand and the rulers take counsel together against the
[01:02:09.860 --> 01:02:17.860]  Lord and against His anointed saying, let us tear their fetters apart and cast their
[01:02:17.860 --> 01:02:20.340]  cords from us.
[01:02:20.340 --> 01:02:25.180]  You know when I read that, I said, you know, here's the description of the world economic
[01:02:25.180 --> 01:02:28.100]  form going on right now.
[01:02:28.100 --> 01:02:32.220]  Now the problem is they got bio weapons labs everywhere.
[01:02:32.220 --> 01:02:33.740]  They got nuclear weapons.
[01:02:33.740 --> 01:02:39.140]  They got armies of scum that work for them, pedophiles, devil worshipers, degenerates,
[01:02:39.140 --> 01:02:42.940]  and they're really thinking about turning it all loose and causing a giant global civil
[01:02:42.940 --> 01:02:44.340]  war and a collapse.
[01:02:44.340 --> 01:02:47.540]  The good news is they were going to do that regardless.
[01:02:47.540 --> 01:02:51.380]  Now we're going to force them to do it on our terms and we're going to win.
[01:02:51.380 --> 01:02:55.740]  But I can offer you nothing but hell in the next 10 years.
[01:02:55.740 --> 01:02:57.740]  Nothing but absolute hell.
[01:02:57.740 --> 01:03:02.900]  So you're not in your bed sucking your thumbs when these people hate.
[01:03:02.900 --> 01:03:07.900]  Because if you think get in a catatonic position like a baby and curling up in a ball is going
[01:03:07.900 --> 01:03:08.900]  to protect you.
[01:03:08.900 --> 01:03:15.140]  I got news for you and these people are devil worshiping pedophiles and they've got their
[01:03:15.140 --> 01:03:21.740]  operatives everywhere who are spiritually ignited and spiritually energized against
[01:03:21.740 --> 01:03:22.740]  us.
[01:03:22.740 --> 01:03:26.820]  And they're in the banks, they're in the police departments, they're in the law firms, they're
[01:03:26.820 --> 01:03:31.620]  in the universities, they're in the schools, they're everywhere.
[01:03:31.620 --> 01:03:40.700]  Because when you have this type of consolidation, apostasy is much easier when people band together.
[01:03:40.700 --> 01:03:45.940]  The whole Tower of Babel episode needs to be understood in the light of Genesis 3.15.
[01:03:45.940 --> 01:03:53.700]  The devil in this story is trying to consolidate humanity in open rebellion against God to
[01:03:53.700 --> 01:03:59.580]  destroy the holy line, to totally corrupt and demoralize the world so that the promised
[01:03:59.580 --> 01:04:05.980]  Messiah who would crush the serpent's head would not be able to come.
[01:04:05.980 --> 01:04:14.020]  In one great apostate united system against God, you might call this a New World Order.
[01:04:14.020 --> 01:04:19.260]  One like Vladimir Putin has now upset this balance of the New World Order that they were
[01:04:19.260 --> 01:04:22.340]  trying to achieve by going into Ukraine.
[01:04:22.340 --> 01:04:23.900]  The evil people want to run things.
[01:04:23.900 --> 01:04:29.620]  And I know that people like General Flynn is like kind of a, what I call a military
[01:04:29.620 --> 01:04:30.620]  Amish person.
[01:04:30.620 --> 01:04:36.300]  I don't mean he's against technology, he thinks it's, he thinks it's at a subconscious level
[01:04:36.300 --> 01:04:38.980]  a little too worldly to want to be the leader.
[01:04:38.980 --> 01:04:46.020]  A little too pushy to come out and, you know, it's just not, well, it's a little arrogant,
[01:04:46.020 --> 01:04:47.020]  it's a little egotistical.
[01:04:47.020 --> 01:04:48.020]  No, it's not.
[01:04:48.020 --> 01:04:49.020]  No, it's not.
[01:04:49.020 --> 01:05:00.060]  It's not, we're going to lead or we're going to die.
[01:05:00.060 --> 01:05:01.940]  Info wars has made history.
[01:05:01.940 --> 01:05:04.500]  You have made history by supporting info wars.
[01:05:04.500 --> 01:05:07.220]  The globalists are being defeated on every front.
[01:05:07.220 --> 01:05:11.260]  And now is the time to not just sit on our laurels because we're winning battles.
[01:05:11.260 --> 01:05:14.500]  Let's win the war, the information war.
[01:05:14.500 --> 01:05:18.460]  There's nothing you can do more important than keeping info wars on air in the fight
[01:05:18.460 --> 01:05:19.460]  for liberty.
[01:05:19.460 --> 01:05:23.580]  I don't think anybody denies that fact and I think if you're past support, but I'm encouraging

[01:06:13.980 --> 01:06:24.860]  coming to you live from the front lines of the info war a poll went up on info wars.com
[01:06:24.860 --> 01:06:30.540]  this morning it's got 15,700 votes as of a few minutes ago when I printed this off and
[01:06:30.540 --> 01:06:34.420]  we we asked what issue is most concerned to you right now illegal immigration economy
[01:06:34.420 --> 01:06:40.900]  censorship medical tyranny illegal immigration was 26% economy 25 censorship 11 medical tyranny
[01:06:40.900 --> 01:06:46.900]  2037 and whoever the crew put that up it's a good poll but I would have just added the
[01:06:46.900 --> 01:06:52.860]  other point of the war in Ukraine leading to nuclear war with the doomsday clock moved
[01:06:52.860 --> 01:06:58.820]  by the international committee to 90 seconds to total Armageddon but I would ask our next
[01:06:58.820 --> 01:07:02.620]  guest what does he think is a bigger issue the medical tyranny or the world marching
[01:07:02.620 --> 01:07:07.660]  towards thermonuclear war and I think both of them are the same subject of an establishment
[01:07:07.660 --> 01:07:14.060]  that's gone quite mad well we've had a lot of big guests on here but of the top two or
[01:07:14.060 --> 01:07:19.340]  three people that from the beginning of expose this the guy that first well over two years
[01:07:19.340 --> 01:07:23.780]  ago that specifically predicted everything was going to happen filed emergency motions
[01:07:23.780 --> 01:07:28.540]  the European Union Parliament that I saw with Wolfgang Wudorg and others was Dr. Michael
[01:07:28.540 --> 01:07:36.860]  Yedon and he couldn't have a better curriculum vitae or a background Dr. Yedon is a professional
[01:07:36.860 --> 01:07:41.180]  research scientist he's a lifelong career in big pharma and biotech R&D proceeded by
[01:07:41.180 --> 01:07:46.740]  training with joint first-class honors in biochemistry and toxicology also in three
[01:07:46.740 --> 01:07:51.140]  years of research based on impact of opiates on receptors even more noteworthy is that
[01:07:51.140 --> 01:07:57.580]  he used the fentanyl class of synthetic opiates invented at Janssen labs now part of Johnson
[01:07:57.580 --> 01:08:02.420]  which places him in a unique position to offer expert testimony as well he has trained and
[01:08:02.420 --> 01:08:06.620]  practiced research across a wide range of relevant life sciences for 40 years he retired
[01:08:06.620 --> 01:08:10.900]  what four years ago or so or he could correct me from Pfizer as their vice president one
[01:08:10.900 --> 01:08:14.460]  of their main directors I'm gonna let him give you his background so I don't get it
[01:08:14.460 --> 01:08:20.940]  wrong but you couldn't have a more credentialed individual and I'd call him with really establishment
[01:08:20.940 --> 01:08:25.740]  whistleblower then Dr. Michael Yedon I'm gonna do my best because we have millions of people
[01:08:25.740 --> 01:08:30.820]  tuned in to try to let him just lead this discussion where he wants to go here in the
[01:08:30.820 --> 01:08:36.780]  next 50 minutes we have so Dr. Yedon take it over thank you very much Alex it's a real
[01:08:36.780 --> 01:08:41.340]  privilege to speak to you and through you hopefully to a large audience some of whom
[01:08:41.340 --> 01:08:48.860]  have not heard from me before so yes I think it would be fair to say I am the most qualified
[01:08:48.860 --> 01:08:54.140]  former pharmaceutical company executive speaking anywhere in the world that was true early in
[01:08:54.140 --> 01:09:00.620]  2020 and it's still true now sadly as you say I have a proper training in biochemistry
[01:09:00.620 --> 01:09:07.380]  toxicology and then a research based PhD on opiates and respiration then I spent 23 years
[01:09:07.380 --> 01:09:13.020]  in Big Pharma leaving Pfizer as their vice president worldwide head of respiratory research
[01:09:13.020 --> 01:09:19.100]  in 2011 and then I worked for 10 years in biotech I founded a biotech company myself
[01:09:19.100 --> 01:09:25.740]  I was the CEO and I led that through financing clinical trials and it was acquired by Novartis
[01:09:25.740 --> 01:09:33.140]  in 2017 so the point of saying this is I think I am the peer scientifically of anyone you
[01:09:33.140 --> 01:09:41.260]  will hear on the TV in public health like Dr. Fauci or Sir Patrick Valance in the UK
[01:09:41.260 --> 01:09:48.260]  or any of the senior pharmaceutical R&D staff that are running the vaccine R&D programs
[01:09:48.260 --> 01:09:55.380]  right now I know personally three of the four people running it and I realised very early
[01:09:55.380 --> 01:10:03.180]  on March 2020 that basically we were under attack and I knew this for this reason we
[01:10:03.180 --> 01:10:09.740]  had imposed upon us lockdowns an absurd prison slang type of approach for which there was
[01:10:09.740 --> 01:10:21.460]  no precedent anywhere in public health. Sorry sir your Skype broke up for five seconds
[01:10:21.460 --> 01:10:28.860]  please continue. So basically the lockdown told us that there was a supranational plot
[01:10:28.860 --> 01:10:36.180]  I am afraid to impose these measures upon us and then if I just make three quick points
[01:10:36.180 --> 01:10:46.460]  the first is we have been lied to by government officials and corporate types about absolutely
[01:10:46.460 --> 01:10:51.380]  everything to do with this so called virus pandemic the severity of the public health
[01:10:51.380 --> 01:10:59.860]  threat the necessity to lock down asymptomatic transmission the use of masks mass testing
[01:10:59.860 --> 01:11:08.260]  and finally vaccines every single part of the narrative every single part is a lie scientifically
[01:11:08.260 --> 01:11:14.740]  proven and I know that the people like Fauci likes the Patrick Valance for lying through
[01:11:14.740 --> 01:11:20.740]  the TVs to the audience because we share a common training I trained at the same kind
[01:11:20.740 --> 01:11:25.580]  of universities at the same time that meant we had the same foundational training for
[01:11:25.580 --> 01:11:30.540]  example in immunology and then when they said things I knew were not true I knew that they
[01:11:30.540 --> 01:11:36.140]  knew that too and that they were lying to you and that was what kickstarted me from
[01:11:36.140 --> 01:11:40.180]  very early on. Well I'm not a famous well-known scientist
[01:11:40.180 --> 01:11:45.220]  top of your class like you but I know basic things like learned immunity is better than
[01:11:45.220 --> 01:11:49.860]  artificial immunity and they said no that's not the case or they said this was a vaccine
[01:11:49.860 --> 01:11:53.380]  when it wasn't a classic vaccine I mean they were and they were attacking therapeutics
[01:11:53.380 --> 01:11:57.820]  that is a Pentagon had tested years ago and said we're really good with these type of
[01:11:57.820 --> 01:12:02.580]  viruses so I was having the same concerns as a layperson and then I saw your research
[01:12:02.580 --> 01:12:09.700]  and it really validated my basic understanding. Now you're right and in fact I've got a couple
[01:12:09.700 --> 01:12:13.580]  of phrases people told me were very powerful just threw them out there so I've got this
[01:12:13.580 --> 01:12:18.820]  rhetorical question Alex what's the right number of times your public health officials
[01:12:18.820 --> 01:12:22.780]  should lie to you in a way that could cost you your health or your life what's the right
[01:12:22.780 --> 01:12:27.700]  number now I think the answer is zero right it shouldn't deliberately tell you things
[01:12:27.700 --> 01:12:32.660]  that they know to be untrue. Well you've just listed three or four I've found six seven
[01:12:32.660 --> 01:12:38.900]  eight there is no question these people are lying to you when people lie to you it's to
[01:12:38.900 --> 01:12:45.900]  hide something or to introduce something and I think they are introducing these so-called
[01:12:45.900 --> 01:12:53.500]  vaccines and what I cut to the the cuts of the chase there was no necessity whatsoever
[01:12:53.500 --> 01:12:59.460]  to introduce something called a vaccine let me just explain why the younger people people
[01:12:59.460 --> 01:13:08.180]  my age I'm 62 so a youngish fifth person or younger almost none of them died of this so-called
[01:13:08.180 --> 01:13:12.540]  virus so why would you want to vaccinate all the population when most people have got
[01:13:12.540 --> 01:13:18.180]  perfectly satisfactory immunity so that's one thing and yet Bill Gates and others wanted
[01:13:18.180 --> 01:13:23.380]  a needle in every arm and they still want a needle in every arm but I've got something
[01:13:23.380 --> 01:13:29.700]  even more faithful to the narrative most people will know that you're offered usually free
[01:13:29.700 --> 01:13:37.620]  an annual flu vaccine well the thing is I had a look at the meta-analysis over a decade
[01:13:37.620 --> 01:13:44.580]  in the UK and it turns out that flu vaccines do not reduce severe flu or death from flu
[01:13:44.580 --> 01:13:49.540]  in the UK and there and I can tell you why they don't work the people the reason that
[01:13:49.540 --> 01:13:54.300]  elderly frail people are vulnerable is their immune system slowed down and doesn't respond
[01:13:54.300 --> 01:14:00.460]  well to new challenges right that sounds uncontroversial why in the world Alex would you think they'd
[01:14:00.460 --> 01:14:06.820]  respond well to vaccines and they don't so the people who get benefit don't need it and
[01:14:06.820 --> 01:14:11.980]  the people who are at risk of death don't get the benefit the whole thing is a lie don't
[01:14:11.980 --> 01:14:16.860]  go near these so-called vaccines which I will talk about in depth we've got a few minutes
[01:14:16.860 --> 01:14:21.260]  to break we'll come back but you've really called it years ago it was happening you've
[01:14:21.260 --> 01:14:26.260]  you've now said I don't put words your mouth but your own words but this is a premeditated
[01:14:26.260 --> 01:14:32.460]  poisonous or dangerous thing speak to how you know it's premeditated and then why would
[01:14:32.460 --> 01:14:35.620]  they do it why would they think they're gonna get away with it because now it looks like
[01:14:35.620 --> 01:14:41.340]  they're not getting away with it thanks to you well I'm not the only one I think that
[01:14:41.340 --> 01:14:46.580]  the main weapon they have against people like me and you will know all about this is censorship
[01:14:46.580 --> 01:14:52.300]  I'm probably the most one of the most sense sense of people I've been ejected off Twitter
[01:14:52.300 --> 01:14:57.340]  and I've not been allowed back despite my appeals I can't comment under a YouTube video
[01:14:57.340 --> 01:15:04.020]  or post any they get deleted in real time as I type them I can't you know if you Google
[01:15:04.020 --> 01:15:09.780]  me you'll find I'm a conspiracy theorist but if you use something like Yandex which
[01:15:09.780 --> 01:15:16.860]  is a Russian browser you will find 80 interviews by me so you know so basically they're not
[01:15:16.860 --> 01:15:22.020]  frightened of people like me because they figure that I won't be heard so here's the
[01:15:22.020 --> 01:15:29.420]  thing please listener what I ask you to do is memorize two or three of the most powerful
[01:15:29.420 --> 01:15:35.020]  things I told you you please you must go and tell ten other people please don't tell me
[01:15:35.020 --> 01:15:38.940]  it's hard I know it's hard I've been trying to do this for almost three years but the
[01:15:38.940 --> 01:15:43.660]  only way we'll win is if you tell ten other people the mass media is never gonna tell
[01:15:43.660 --> 01:15:47.620]  them right they're never gonna tell them and they won't work it out on their own they're
[01:15:47.620 --> 01:15:51.540]  still in the narrative well that's right stay there that's so powerful though the people
[01:15:51.540 --> 01:15:55.620]  have to mobilize they tell ten they tell ten tell them tell ten chain reaction stay there
[01:15:55.620 --> 01:16:03.140]  Michael you know we'll come right back well I just want to say about diet force diet force

[01:19:02.300 --> 01:19:10.580]  satirist in minds famously said more than 150 years ago rumors of his demise had been
[01:19:10.580 --> 01:19:14.860]  greatly exaggerated because the newspapers kept saying he died decades before he did
[01:19:14.860 --> 01:19:21.060]  die and it's the same psi op today info wars is more influential and more powerful than

[01:19:29.820 --> 01:19:35.260]  away and you stop supporting you stop spreading the word then they do win ladies and gentlemen
[01:19:35.260 --> 01:19:39.820]  there's only one group of people that could shut down info wars and that's you the viewers
[01:19:39.820 --> 01:19:43.980]  and listeners if you decide we're done we're done if you decide to go to info wars store
[01:19:43.980 --> 01:19:48.220]  dot com and get supplements and books and films and t-shirts and so much more we will
[01:19:48.220 --> 01:19:52.980]  stay on the air indefinitely it is all in your hands so thanks for your support stand
[01:19:52.980 --> 01:19:57.300]  up against the globalist go to info wars store dot com right now and keep us on air it's
[01:19:57.300 --> 01:20:06.580]  up to you leading a frontal assault on the lies of the new world order it's alex jones
[01:20:06.580 --> 01:20:28.300]  i've been following dr michael yeaton for almost three years and totally admiring him
[01:20:28.300 --> 01:20:32.340]  and of course i get his name wrong and say yeaton it's yeaton and we've got him till
[01:20:32.340 --> 01:20:36.620]  the end of the hour and i really want him to just know he has the floor and laser focus
[01:20:36.620 --> 01:20:42.020]  on what he saw he's already on his curriculum the background his predictions that came exactly
[01:20:42.020 --> 01:20:48.060]  true in that emergency filing he did in the e u in december of 2000 that was so powerful
[01:20:48.060 --> 01:20:53.060]  to predict the blood clots the heart attacks the microchorditis the infertility and and
[01:20:53.060 --> 01:20:56.940]  then now the vindication is all this comes out as a confirmed and then where does he
[01:20:56.940 --> 01:21:02.100]  see this needs to go to bring justice to these people because he's right the censorship day
[01:21:02.100 --> 01:21:08.260]  one is what allowed them to get away with this this this attack to obviously bring in
[01:21:08.260 --> 01:21:13.060]  their global social credit score their vaccine passports all of that so so sir please continue
[01:21:13.060 --> 01:21:19.300]  yeah no certainly you asked me alex before the break how i was so sure that this was
[01:21:19.300 --> 01:21:25.100]  deliberate rather than some sort of accidental overreaction but what i can tell you is that
[01:21:25.100 --> 01:21:32.180]  um the the uh this idea or telling us that there's a pandemic and using coordinated media
[01:21:32.180 --> 01:21:37.700]  to terrify people in every country and then as you said uh using the lockdown at a kind
[01:21:37.700 --> 01:21:45.300]  of prison term um that didn't just get worked out in the first quarter of 2020 i didn't
[01:21:45.300 --> 01:21:52.940]  realize till about a year but at least 10 rehearsals have taken place and i've prompted
[01:21:52.940 --> 01:21:58.700]  your researchers to look and pick up a video by a german journalist called paul schreyer
[01:21:58.700 --> 01:22:06.220]  s-e-h-r-e-y-e-r on youtube surprisingly called pandemic simulations preparation for a new
[01:22:06.220 --> 01:22:13.340]  era they have been running simulations of worldwide pandemics mostly for spiritual disease since
[01:22:13.340 --> 01:22:20.220]  1997 uh and they've involved every country and institution uh including coming up to
[01:22:20.220 --> 01:22:25.420]  the billgate sponsored event 201 at the end of 2019 they've rehearsed this again and again
[01:22:25.420 --> 01:22:30.700]  and again and again that tells me it's deliberate that they intended to execute this plan that's
[01:22:30.700 --> 01:22:35.180]  the first thing to say and then the second thing like i've said is all the things they
[01:22:35.180 --> 01:22:40.220]  told us about the virus were lies absolutely everything it's not very serious it doesn't
[01:22:40.220 --> 01:22:45.980]  kill many people children are not faintly at risk and so on and that was so that they could
[01:22:45.980 --> 01:22:52.540]  get you used to taking orders from mass media people you know who are these people that they
[01:22:52.540 --> 01:22:57.260]  think they can order you and i around so they but they've frightened people and got them used to
[01:22:57.260 --> 01:23:04.300]  jumping uh to to orders that's one thing but the main thing they wanted i think was to get people
[01:23:04.300 --> 01:23:09.820]  ready to roll their sleeves up and take a jack now just before the break i told you that flu
[01:23:09.820 --> 01:23:16.140]  vaccines do not reduce serious illness and death in the vulnerable so don't reduce death well i'll
[01:23:16.140 --> 01:23:22.060]  tell you what even if these vaccines had been made well and uh and delivered appropriately
[01:23:22.060 --> 01:23:27.340]  this still wouldn't work because the people who would die of this so-called COVID-19 are the people
[01:23:27.340 --> 01:23:35.820]  who could not be helped by vaccination vaccination is the wrong strategy for any new outbreak like
[01:23:35.820 --> 01:23:41.740]  this it should always be early treatment so what are they doing they've lied they're going forward
[01:23:41.740 --> 01:23:47.260]  with the strategy that i've just explained as an expert could not possibly work does not work in the
[01:23:47.260 --> 01:23:53.900]  case of flu and yet they've injected i think five and a half billion people for goodness sake five
[01:23:53.900 --> 01:23:59.260]  and a half billion people and then i'm going to tell you what i don't know why other people aren't
[01:23:59.260 --> 01:24:06.220]  saying it's in the industry if you introduce uh to the human body mRNA uh basically wrapped in
[01:24:06.220 --> 01:24:11.900]  lipid which is like the Pfizer and Moderna products if they get expressed taken up in your body you
[01:24:11.900 --> 01:24:17.980]  hijack the manufacturing machinery in in your body and you make whatever's encoded alex you will be
[01:24:17.980 --> 01:24:25.660]  made you will turn yourself into a virus protein or foreign protein factory this is terrible your
[01:24:25.660 --> 01:24:32.860]  body uh demarks the inside and keeps it as self and the outside is non-self and when when the when
[01:24:32.860 --> 01:24:38.700]  they mix you get an immune reaction so when they skip so when the shot skips the sinus in your body's
[01:24:38.700 --> 01:24:43.420]  first line of defenses it goes in explain that you're a scientist it programs yourselves to make
[01:24:43.420 --> 01:24:50.700]  the spike protein similar to similar to prions right not necessarily but the main thing is they're
[01:24:50.700 --> 01:24:57.500]  making a protein that does not belong in your body your body notices that those cells and tissues are
[01:24:57.500 --> 01:25:05.500]  are are expressing non-self your immune soldiers or platoon heavy weapons go to work and their job
[01:25:05.500 --> 01:25:11.100]  is to destroy that cell that's how they stop you getting cancer every day if there's a single cell
[01:25:11.100 --> 01:25:15.420]  that goes aberrant humorous so they know they know that it's going to cause an autoimmune response to
[01:25:15.420 --> 01:25:22.060]  the body definitely every time and and here's the worst part the thing that's i mean i wish
[01:25:22.060 --> 01:25:28.380]  it didn't but things keep confirming what i guessed in 2020 which was this is the talent area in control
[01:25:29.340 --> 01:25:34.940]  and ultimately they're going to depopulate which sounds crazy i was i was a person that listened
[01:25:34.940 --> 01:25:41.660]  to the bbc and read the times newspaper until 2020 i have no history of involvement in unusual
[01:25:41.660 --> 01:25:46.940]  campaigns and i probably would have chuckled at conspiracy theorists present company accepted
[01:25:46.940 --> 01:25:52.700]  but i'm now joining you it's absolutely obvious that if you inject people with mrna it doesn't
[01:25:52.700 --> 01:25:58.940]  matter what it encodes for what did we hear a month ago the pharmaceutical companies
[01:25:58.940 --> 01:26:07.260]  are re-manufacturing all the old vaccines in mrna form and they've ordered or there are business
[01:26:07.260 --> 01:26:14.460]  terms with each government force to buy 10 injections per man woman and baby in in every
[01:26:14.460 --> 01:26:19.980]  country and i can assure you you you could not possibly stand up to 10 of these injections
[01:26:19.980 --> 01:26:25.500]  but i can see how easily they could put this in a position where you get no choice so just cut
[01:26:25.500 --> 01:26:30.780]  into the chase what i think is going to happen i wish i wasn't being right i think they will make
[01:26:30.780 --> 01:26:37.740]  a digital id mandatory not necessarily vaccine passport but that would do digital id will become
[01:26:37.740 --> 01:26:43.020]  mandatory you will not be able to shop or travel or work without it or get health care and i think
[01:26:43.020 --> 01:26:47.980]  the other thing they'll do is withdraw cash and replace all currency with central bank digital
[01:26:47.980 --> 01:26:55.020]  currencies at that point alex if they if they say if you don't get your next jab we won't
[01:26:55.020 --> 01:27:01.020]  you will not allow you to buy gasoline or travel or buy food that the system i've just described is
[01:27:01.020 --> 01:27:08.540]  trivia it's already ready to go so i say to people use cash diversify the businesses you work you
[01:27:08.540 --> 01:27:12.780]  buy from any business that won't take cash tell them you're not you're not going to work with them
[01:27:12.780 --> 01:27:18.940]  anymore um and for goodness sake tell people i don't care if it might be a little embarrassing
[01:27:18.940 --> 01:27:23.820]  i can assure you what i've been doing for the last few years it says not enhance my reputation
[01:27:23.820 --> 01:27:28.620]  with the people i used to work with the cowards i'll call them out again you know patrick valance
[01:27:29.420 --> 01:27:36.460]  your liar matai mammon who was the head of r&d at johnson johnson johnson i i told him that he
[01:27:36.460 --> 01:27:42.140]  he should resign before he gets in present and he's resigned he resigned making no announcements
[01:27:42.140 --> 01:27:48.540]  as to the reason why uh who else many pangolosa astrazeneca you were a criminal you need to sue me
[01:27:48.540 --> 01:27:54.620]  uh otherwise you know everyone will know what i've just said is true so uh every person who's
[01:27:54.620 --> 01:28:00.700]  injected with a product that contains messenger RNA that codes for something that doesn't belong
[01:28:00.700 --> 01:28:07.020]  in your body will induce an autoimmune reaction so here's the thing this i think will resonate
[01:28:07.660 --> 01:28:12.300]  no one else has said this have you noticed that there's a wide range of side effects
[01:28:12.300 --> 01:28:19.100]  from the existing mRNA vaccines myocarditis neurological conditions brain blood clots um uh
[01:28:20.220 --> 01:28:26.300]  d-vane thrombosis and so on i think i know why when you get injected with one of these materials
[01:28:26.300 --> 01:28:32.060]  they don't they don't deposit evenly around the body that sometimes more of it will go to one
[01:28:32.060 --> 01:28:37.180]  vascular bed than another so if it goes mostly to your heart i think those are the people who've
[01:28:37.180 --> 01:28:42.540]  got um myocarditis stay this is too important longer segment coming up incredibly important
[01:28:42.540 --> 01:28:48.460]  information dr michael yedon stay right there oh man this is so important and it's all been
[01:28:48.460 --> 01:28:51.980]  vindicated everything he says come true we're gonna talk about it all and what he believes
[01:28:51.980 --> 01:28:56.060]  is coming next we're gonna stop this takeover this biomedical journey together stay with us
[01:29:00.300 --> 01:29:04.700]  i talk a lot about the great successes and four wars this hand i don't think anybody can
[01:29:04.700 --> 01:29:10.940]  deny it and it is because of listeners and viewers supporting us when we talk about the crew at

[01:33:02.380 --> 01:33:19.580]  the lives of the new world order it's alex jones from the front lines of the information war it's
[01:33:19.580 --> 01:33:26.860]  alex jones well this is such a life-saving information dr. monkey even as our guest i
[01:33:26.860 --> 01:33:31.180]  would invite him back for a commercial free podcast that we tape on saturdays we can tape
[01:33:31.180 --> 01:33:35.420]  at any time but those are usually about two three million views people love those commercial
[01:33:35.420 --> 01:33:39.180]  free podcasts that way he can even send us a power point if he wants when we put slides
[01:33:39.180 --> 01:33:43.260]  i'm going to give you a whole presentation without me even talking but but we ran another
[01:33:43.260 --> 01:33:49.020]  break sir you're trying to make a point that was really key as we went to break yeah sure thank you
[01:33:49.020 --> 01:33:54.460]  i was talking just before the break that when a person is injected with one of these mrna
[01:33:54.460 --> 01:34:00.140]  so-called vaccines they don't distribute evenly around the body they'll be kind of lumpy distribution
[01:34:00.140 --> 01:34:06.620]  and so i believe that whenever wherever it lands in your body in the heart or blood vessels in the
[01:34:06.620 --> 01:34:13.420]  brain or in your legs whatever if it gets taken up and expressed there you end up showing non-self
[01:34:13.420 --> 01:34:18.860]  to your immune system which comes in and destroys that tissue and maybe cell by cell it won't kill
[01:34:18.860 --> 01:34:24.060]  you on day one but that's why people get progressive illness quite often and they're just constantly
[01:34:24.060 --> 01:34:30.300]  sick so here's the thing if this if you get a lot of deposition in the heart you'll get myocarditis
[01:34:30.300 --> 01:34:35.580]  or pericarditis if you get a lot of distribution in your brain or spinal cord or peripheral nervous
[01:34:35.580 --> 01:34:40.620]  system any one of a number of horrible neurological conditions that you've seen people shaking
[01:34:40.620 --> 01:34:47.260]  uncontrollably and so on if it lands in the back of your eye you'll get a loss of vision suddenly
[01:34:47.260 --> 01:34:54.860]  one eye and that's happens with two people i know what else if it lands in your ovaries infertility
[01:34:54.860 --> 01:35:02.060]  your immune system will destroy the cell the egg cells in your ovary if it lands in pregnant uterus
[01:35:02.780 --> 01:35:09.740]  silver or premature delivery so you get the point what i've told you explains all the all the
[01:35:09.740 --> 01:35:16.540]  effects the fact that people aren't becoming ill and dying and the huge diversity of adverse events
[01:35:16.540 --> 01:35:22.860]  they are just ignoring it's all clearly there in public databases like va er s in the us very good
[01:35:22.860 --> 01:35:28.860]  system med the medics sorry the military has a similar system shows same pattern yellow car
[01:35:28.860 --> 01:35:34.140]  and so on everywhere in the world honest public health officials can see what i'm saying is true
[01:35:34.140 --> 01:35:39.660]  but they're just lying lying lying and the insurance company actuaries are showing a massive increase
[01:35:39.660 --> 01:35:45.180]  in death never before seen correct they are absolutely let's see and then people when people
[01:35:45.180 --> 01:35:50.620]  say oh well it's cobit no it isn't that the people who are dying now are the people who've been
[01:35:50.620 --> 01:35:55.900]  injected and a lot of those people are young and middle-aged people which is why lots of workforce
[01:35:55.900 --> 01:36:01.180]  is having enormous sickness absence rates at the moment so you're right the life insurance
[01:36:01.180 --> 01:36:06.700]  excess claims is for the working age population they're not the people who typically would have
[01:36:06.700 --> 01:36:13.180]  perished with flu you know at 80 or 90 years of age it's young people it's all around the world
[01:36:13.180 --> 01:36:18.540]  almost without exception where cobit 19 vaccines have been you know reigned upon the population
[01:36:19.580 --> 01:36:26.780]  and just just again just a quick point so that people will know you're being lied to so for
[01:36:26.780 --> 01:36:33.740]  example we were told it's safe to give to pregnant women well i can tell you 60 years of experience
[01:36:33.740 --> 01:36:39.660]  since the lidomide has that because you say red line that operated all the way through my career
[01:36:39.660 --> 01:36:45.900]  you never give experimental medical interventions to a pregnant woman Alex you never do it even if
[01:36:45.900 --> 01:36:50.220]  it's might might save a life you still have to have that argument about whether it's worth risking
[01:36:50.220 --> 01:36:56.700]  birth malformations or killing the fetus that's one group we never should inject people who already
[01:36:56.700 --> 01:37:03.660]  apparently had this disorder yeah as you said immunity from prior illness of the same type is
[01:37:03.660 --> 01:37:09.020]  the strongest defense and then thirdly we should never eject children not one of them in Europe
[01:37:09.020 --> 01:37:15.820]  died because of this so-called virus so they're chasing pregnant women your children or grandchildren
[01:37:15.820 --> 01:37:20.460]  and they're chasing you if you've not been jabbed even if you think you've had it already
[01:37:20.460 --> 01:37:27.020]  these guys are literally they are psychopaths at this point and one thing i wanted to mention
[01:37:27.020 --> 01:37:31.820]  people might say well you know if it wasn't as bad as you say you know this virus and it wasn't an
[01:37:31.820 --> 01:37:39.020]  emergency how did they all die and i can i can tell you medical murder i mean it's absolutely shocking
[01:37:39.020 --> 01:37:45.420]  a lot of people were admitted to hospital and if they had a positive test PCR tests then they were
[01:37:45.420 --> 01:37:52.380]  told we were told they were a a COVID admission those people were given remdesivir which is a
[01:37:52.380 --> 01:37:57.900]  supposed antiviral but it actually destroys the kidneys in about 20 to 30 percent of patients
[01:37:57.900 --> 01:38:03.820]  it's so toxic you shouldn't give it and by the way since you're a world-leading expert in in opiates
[01:38:03.820 --> 01:38:08.860]  and in drugs for surgery i've got the name of the drug but i saw it in the uk that the government
[01:38:08.860 --> 01:38:15.660]  stocked up on before COVID and that they gave patients that had COVID and were on respirators
[01:38:15.660 --> 01:38:20.780]  but the but the but the drug was known to kill respiration what was that drug yeah it's called
[01:38:20.780 --> 01:38:26.940]  my that's called mydazolam and the mixture of mydazolam which is it's like a grand daddy of
[01:38:26.940 --> 01:38:32.780]  valium so it's a real strong sedative so mydazolam and they were also giving them morphine which is
[01:38:32.780 --> 01:38:39.180]  like a fentanyl type drug mydazolam morphine and remdesivir but here's the thing they're also
[01:38:39.180 --> 01:38:44.220]  giving them mechanical ventilation what you would not be expected to know and the public
[01:38:44.220 --> 01:38:48.700]  should not be expected to know because they think of mechanical ventilation as lifesaving
[01:38:48.700 --> 01:38:53.260]  well sure it is if you've come in with a road traffic accident or if you're having to have
[01:38:53.260 --> 01:39:00.300]  open chest surgery but i'll tell you what in my 30 years experience we we never ventilated
[01:39:00.300 --> 01:39:06.700]  someone with of 80 with other diseases because they had flu why not really important this one
[01:39:06.700 --> 01:39:12.060]  influenza like illnesses including COVID are not obstructive airway diseases they don't
[01:39:12.060 --> 01:39:18.060]  obstruct your airway if you're breathless you need oxygen but you definitely don't want to be sedated
[01:39:18.060 --> 01:39:23.340]  intubated and ventilated because that on its own is incredibly aggressive to an elderly person
[01:39:23.340 --> 01:39:29.820]  and then the Watt IV remdesivir mydazolam and morphine and they did it at higher doses than
[01:39:29.820 --> 01:39:35.900]  usual it's not hidden uh the sure and it was globally standardized even the UN had meetings
[01:39:35.900 --> 01:39:41.100]  that said we're told what to do by big pharma so big pharma got together and these confabs
[01:39:41.100 --> 01:39:45.820]  decided the policy did the drills beforehand suppressed the therapeutics suppressed speech
[01:39:45.820 --> 01:39:49.820]  to suppress the truth and then rolled something out as you said that's premeditated murder
[01:39:49.820 --> 01:39:55.420]  you i'm afraid yeah there's no question there was no question about it and you might say well
[01:39:55.420 --> 01:39:59.980]  or people might say well surely the doctors would know this is not right no only a small
[01:39:59.980 --> 01:40:04.780]  percentage of people like the ER people or people who are skilled in acute medicine
[01:40:05.660 --> 01:40:10.300]  would understand what i just said that mechanical ventilation in the right place is lifesaving and
[01:40:10.300 --> 01:40:16.460]  miracle for everybody else to stay away from it and giving it to elderly people without obstructed
[01:40:16.460 --> 01:40:21.660]  airways they just have flu like illness so you should give them um you should give them oxygen
[01:40:21.660 --> 01:40:25.020]  and calm your doctor at the time we have and i can have it back for 10 hours we were so gracious
[01:40:25.020 --> 01:40:30.780]  to join us we got a few minutes to break just 35 000 foot view and i want you to say it in
[01:40:30.780 --> 01:40:36.220]  your own words you were on a show about a month ago we played it a lot and you said look i didn't
[01:40:36.220 --> 01:40:40.300]  really believe in god or any of this but looking at this it makes you know there's there's organized
[01:40:40.300 --> 01:40:46.380]  evil can you in your own words elaborate on that and restate that yes i certainly can and it is uh
[01:40:46.380 --> 01:40:53.020]  i've looked very hard for people always ask me why are they doing it and they claim they're doing
[01:40:53.020 --> 01:40:58.140]  well they claim there's a necessity to reduce the population because the world is overpopulated
[01:40:58.140 --> 01:41:03.340]  it's not true if you if you look at the density of people on the planet and the rate of growth
[01:41:03.340 --> 01:41:08.540]  now is almost here it's almost flattened out uh people like mask have said the biggest problem in
[01:41:08.540 --> 01:41:14.780]  50 years is a falling population so rule that one out we're not overpopulated we're also not running
[01:41:14.780 --> 01:41:20.700]  out of so-called fossil fuels there's loads of coal and oil and the climate we are not destroying
[01:41:20.700 --> 01:41:26.700]  the climate that they've had 50 years worth of lies on that on that front so i've ruled out
[01:41:27.740 --> 01:41:32.300]  the things i would like there to be a reason and i get to the conclusion that they're doing it
[01:41:32.300 --> 01:41:37.980]  because one because they can i think they've been planning it for decades and secondly i think they
[01:41:37.980 --> 01:41:42.380]  they believe it's there i don't know at birth right i think it's but i do believe it's diabolical
[01:41:42.940 --> 01:41:47.900]  it's not science-based these people they want control and they're quite happy to i think they're
[01:41:47.900 --> 01:41:53.340]  going to kill 90 percent of the population if we don't stop them so but here's a here's a point one
[01:41:53.340 --> 01:41:59.580]  of the ways they'll do it the w.h.o i think is a horrible organization it's not not really anything
[01:41:59.580 --> 01:42:06.060]  to do with health they are trying at the moment folks to get all the countries of the world to
[01:42:06.060 --> 01:42:12.140]  sign updated international health regulations whereby in the events of public health emergency
[01:42:12.140 --> 01:42:18.620]  of international concern then ted ross the head of the w.h.o i'm not kidding you here will have
[01:42:18.620 --> 01:42:26.620]  legal autonomy legal power to set health policy in your country in the us in europe in the uk
[01:42:26.620 --> 01:42:32.220]  and and they're close to doing it the international health regulations but i should point out to you
[01:42:32.220 --> 01:42:39.740]  that even if you trusted the w.h.o you it's mad to centralize power when you're facing a new
[01:42:39.740 --> 01:42:45.420]  challenge how have humans solved uh new challenges the answer is they've done lots of different

[01:48:57.500 --> 01:49:02.540]  other key points you want to add and i think the vindication is important because it shows you were
[01:49:02.540 --> 01:49:06.940]  right others were right so we can now prosecute and go after the folks that did this nurenberg to
[01:49:06.940 --> 01:49:13.740]  criminal investigations in japan europe florida um i mean all over the place these things are starting
[01:49:13.740 --> 01:49:20.860]  please continue so uh like i said that they lied to us from the beginning and the right number of
[01:49:20.860 --> 01:49:25.660]  time is that you're a public health official for lyre zero as soon as you realize they are lying
[01:49:25.660 --> 01:49:32.940]  why would you believe anything else that they say um so and then the main theme about the so-called
[01:49:32.940 --> 01:49:39.900]  vaccines uh is that even if the narrative was accurate which is not they would not work they're
[01:49:39.900 --> 01:49:45.980]  not lifesaving just as flu vaccines are not lifesaving and in particular these messenger RNA
[01:49:45.980 --> 01:49:51.980]  uh creations when they're expressed in various tissues of your body cause your body to attack
[01:49:51.980 --> 01:49:58.540]  that tissue and it will happen automatically it's not an accidental side effect it's built into the
[01:49:58.540 --> 01:50:06.460]  mechanism so i i describe these as toxic by design and that's why i know it's deliberate and malign
[01:50:06.460 --> 01:50:11.580]  it's i would say it's immunology 101 you would be taught it in the first couple of weeks of any
[01:50:11.580 --> 01:50:17.020]  basic immunology course that's how you just get distinguished self from non-self and keep yourself
[01:50:17.020 --> 01:50:23.660]  you know safe and healthy so don't do not allow yourself no matter the price and the punishment
[01:50:23.660 --> 01:50:29.100]  and the threats to be injected by these mRNA products if you've been unfortunate enough to
[01:50:29.100 --> 01:50:34.860]  have had one uh today's a good day to resolve not to have any more and there are several groups working
[01:50:34.860 --> 01:50:41.100]  on potential antidotes and and recoveries but don't take the chance they're not there for your health
[01:50:41.100 --> 01:50:46.220]  they're there ultimately to i think to depopulate hope so what are they going to do just to say it
[01:50:46.220 --> 01:50:53.740]  again uh i i predict that we will see ever more encroachment over our freedom of movement our
[01:50:53.740 --> 01:51:00.700]  freedom to buy things our freedom to uh consume you know fresh natural products for example and
[01:51:00.700 --> 01:51:07.180]  things will become more and more you know factory farms including the ghastly news i heard tomorrow
[01:51:07.180 --> 01:51:13.500]  the EU will approve a law that allows them to add uh a ground up cricket flower so almost every
[01:51:14.460 --> 01:51:18.220]  a bait goes and people don't know about the stuff they're going to be eating these
[01:51:18.220 --> 01:51:23.100]  but the other thing i predict i predicted as i said earlier is the introduction of a
[01:51:23.100 --> 01:51:27.100]  mandatory digital id they'll say oh well you really need to have one in order that we know
[01:51:27.100 --> 01:51:32.060]  that it's you that's operating your bank accounts alex i'd point out banks have been around for
[01:51:32.060 --> 01:51:38.620]  centuries we've never needed a digital id and we do not need one now so reject it push back
[01:51:38.620 --> 01:51:42.540]  any bang by the way just interrupt back to the crickets i've seen a bunch of studies that the
[01:51:43.340 --> 01:51:48.460]  chitin shell of bugs humans aren't meant to eat those we can eat grubs and things that don't have
[01:51:48.460 --> 01:51:54.380]  that the larval form but but but but it's very toxic to mammals particularly humans to eat bugs
[01:51:55.500 --> 01:52:01.500]  yeah we do not have the enzymes in our guts to break down the shell chitin as you said
[01:52:01.500 --> 01:52:06.620]  we can't eat we cannot eat it so you know they might say well we'll take the wing cases off and
[01:52:06.620 --> 01:52:12.540]  we'll just use the squashy part is that it's a revolting idea and the whole basis of it that
[01:52:12.540 --> 01:52:19.340]  meat is environmentally bad is just BS so you know don't let them do it to us and don't let them
[01:52:19.340 --> 01:52:26.700]  so i've explained why digital digital id is the heart of tyranny you do not need it you've never
[01:52:26.700 --> 01:52:31.580]  needed it you don't need it now someone's trying to make you have one and they're giving you bullshit
[01:52:31.580 --> 01:52:37.740]  reasons why you must have one i think if they say without digital id you can't travel overseas i would
[01:52:37.740 --> 01:52:41.580]  say well i'm going to campaign against it and i ain't traveling overseas until i win that's right we
[01:52:41.580 --> 01:52:44.540]  gotta draw a line on the sand but you've said some really eloquent words you repeat them or
[01:52:44.540 --> 01:52:49.580]  expand them about nuremberg 2 prosecutions what needs to be done Fauci gate of function
[01:52:50.460 --> 01:52:56.140]  yeah no absolutely this i've just listed out several of the things that public health officials
[01:52:56.140 --> 01:53:00.540]  and senior people in pharmaceutical companies add a minimum and there are many others
[01:53:00.540 --> 01:53:06.140]  they've lied to us they've destroyed or damaged with the intention to destroy the economy of
[01:53:06.140 --> 01:53:12.060]  the developed world and i think that's deliberate i think they want to tell us oh dear the economy's
[01:53:12.060 --> 01:53:17.340]  broken everyone's lost confidence in your currency but the bank of international settlements and we
[01:53:17.340 --> 01:53:22.780]  like the fed federal reserve working together will bring out cash the central bank digital currency
[01:53:22.780 --> 01:53:30.380]  combination digital id mandatory and cash for cbdc is the end of your freedom we must not let this
[01:53:30.380 --> 01:53:37.340]  happen so use cash i don't care you know it cannot be too inconvenient to save your life by going to
[01:53:37.340 --> 01:53:42.140]  an atm if you have oh this makes me want to move to the country next to amish and start bordering
[01:53:42.140 --> 01:53:47.500]  with them i mean the whole future is going to be getting away from this exactly so i've written
[01:53:47.500 --> 01:53:54.300]  you know so i use the cash do some basic preparation you know whatever i'm not a prepper but i make
[01:53:54.300 --> 01:53:59.740]  sure that i i know what my next move is so i'm gonna i will minimize the degree so it's taken
[01:53:59.740 --> 01:54:04.540]  but what about going on the offense though peacefully to prosecute them and nip it in the bud
[01:54:05.500 --> 01:54:11.980]  yeah yeah obviously it's not my not my field of expertise but i i have i have written
[01:54:11.980 --> 01:54:19.820]  um uh affidavits for at least 10 different uh court cases so yes i think wherever in the world
[01:54:19.820 --> 01:54:24.780]  and on whatever basis related to all these these covid lies and the pop poisonous injections and
[01:54:24.780 --> 01:54:31.340]  the terrible hospital treatment on any of those bases we need to attack you know uh using using
[01:54:31.340 --> 01:54:37.820]  law as well as letting sure letting people know that this is happening and just trying to persuade
[01:54:37.820 --> 01:54:44.460]  them as soon as people turn off mass media and and start to think they realize what i've said
[01:54:44.460 --> 01:54:49.660]  she was absolutely true so i say never give up um because these people are not going to know i agree
[01:54:49.660 --> 01:54:53.580]  how powerful it is that even the musk hasn't let you and i back on the people that really have an
[01:54:53.580 --> 01:54:59.020]  effect that at least a lot of the stuff's coming out proving big pharma with big tech colluded to
[01:54:59.020 --> 01:55:05.580]  suppress people i mean that is a scandal of scandals absolutely i'm not i'm not a bragging
[01:55:05.580 --> 01:55:10.860]  person but i think the reason they have not allowed me back on alex is that i am absolutely
[01:55:10.860 --> 01:55:15.580]  correct tonight for their narrative people will believe me because i'm telling the truth i've
[01:55:15.580 --> 01:55:20.620]  lost money people say i'm a grifter i've lost hundreds of thousands of dollars i've made
[01:55:20.620 --> 01:55:26.620]  not one dollar in earnings and i've not accepted one dollar in in gifts i think is your mistake
[01:55:26.620 --> 01:55:32.300]  when you're champion freedom you should be writing books you should be the point is i
[01:55:32.300 --> 01:55:37.500]  point i want to make there is i'm not making money from this even though i could and i think that
[01:55:37.500 --> 01:55:42.700]  improves the confidence the audience should have i'm doing it but what proves it is you you you
[01:55:42.700 --> 01:55:46.300]  fouled stuff with the e you in 2000 saying everything was going to happen that did you're
[01:55:46.300 --> 01:55:53.740]  totally dedicated in spades absolutely absolutely i unfortunately it the idea what what is going on
[01:55:53.740 --> 01:55:59.820]  at high level is incredibly simple i i'm ever read i read the canon of american sci-fi as a
[01:55:59.820 --> 01:56:05.980]  teenager uh and this plot is really done uh it's horrible and frightening but it's really it's
[01:56:05.980 --> 01:56:10.860]  really straightforward digital i d roll up for your for your vaccine else we will not let
[01:56:10.860 --> 01:56:15.180]  medical scientists kill most of us the rest of it is sick for life make us so sick we gotta be
[01:56:15.180 --> 01:56:21.180]  in artificial wombs take over the human species i mean it it's a it's a thx 1138 meets brave new
[01:56:21.180 --> 01:56:27.340]  world meets the matrix it is it's all all of that so what else i would say engage local leaders if
[01:56:27.340 --> 01:56:33.100]  you've got a sheriff or a city mayor in a small town or whatever go and find these people just
[01:56:33.100 --> 01:56:38.220]  take a half an hour meeting respectfully turn up with just two or three pieces of information that
[01:56:38.220 --> 01:56:43.820]  says we're clearly being lied to it's not as described and this guy you're eating and Malone
[01:56:43.820 --> 01:56:48.860]  and mcculloch and so on are really worrying me and the good news is we're starting to win but we
[01:56:48.860 --> 01:56:52.860]  can't give up now we got a push push push because like you said they've got new pandemics ready
[01:56:52.860 --> 01:56:58.620]  they're drilling for yeah and the pandemics are i think i should tell you pandemics are actually
[01:56:58.620 --> 01:57:04.300]  impossible and i'll just explain what respiratory severe respiratory disease pandemics are impossible
[01:57:04.300 --> 01:57:10.460]  let me say why but just like Ebola if you've got a really serious respiratory infection you become
[01:57:10.460 --> 01:57:15.420]  symptomatic the day you're infected and that means you withdraw from circulation you're sick in your
[01:57:15.420 --> 01:57:20.060]  bed in your living room or in bed so that means you've stopped it infecting other people it's
[01:57:20.060 --> 01:57:26.060]  literally not possible to have a severe respiratory disease pandemic and that's why we've never had one
[01:57:26.060 --> 01:57:32.620]  the spanish flu they've lied to us about that people died of bacterial pneumonia in a pre-antibiotic
[01:57:32.620 --> 01:57:37.500]  era all right dr michael yedon incredible please come back soon for a commercial free podcast

[02:00:04.780 --> 02:00:08.940]  if i were the prince of darkness i'd want to engulf the whole world in darkness
[02:00:08.940 --> 02:00:13.260]  and i'd have a third of its real estate in four fifths of its population but i wouldn't be happy
[02:00:13.260 --> 02:00:20.860]  until i obscese the ripest apple on the tree so i said about however necessary to take over the
[02:00:20.860 --> 02:00:26.860]  united states but then kennedy has been seriously wounded by this i'd subvert the churches first
[02:00:26.860 --> 02:00:31.420]  i'd begin with a campaign of whispers with the wisdom of the serpent i would whisper to you as
[02:00:31.420 --> 02:00:36.700]  i whispered to you do as you please to the young i would whisper that the bible is a myth i would
[02:00:36.700 --> 02:00:41.740]  convince them that man created god instead of the other way around i would confide that what's bad
[02:00:41.740 --> 02:00:48.540]  is good and what's good is square and the old i would teach you to pray after me our father
[02:00:48.540 --> 02:00:53.900]  which are in washington and then i'd get organized i'd educate authors in how to make
[02:00:53.900 --> 02:00:58.140]  a lurid literature exciting so that anything else would appear dull and uninteresting i'd
[02:00:58.140 --> 02:01:03.660]  threaten tv with dirtier movies and vice versa i'd peddle narcotics to whom i could i'd sell
[02:01:03.660 --> 02:01:10.460]  alcohol to ladies and gentlemen of distinction i'd tranquilize the rest with pills if i were the
[02:01:10.460 --> 02:01:15.980]  devil i'd soon have families at war with themselves churches at war with themselves and nations at
[02:01:15.980 --> 02:01:22.780]  war with themselves until each in its turn was consumed and with promises of higher ratings
[02:01:22.780 --> 02:01:29.980]  i'd have mesmerizing media fanning the flame the president of united states is racist if i were
[02:01:29.980 --> 02:01:34.220]  the devil i would encourage schools to refine young intellects but neglect the discipline
[02:01:34.220 --> 02:01:40.060]  emotions just like those one while within a decade i'd have prisons overflowing i'd have judges
[02:01:40.060 --> 02:01:45.260]  promoting pornography soon i could evict god from the courthouse then from the schoolhouse
[02:01:45.260 --> 02:01:50.140]  and then from the houses of congress and in his own churches i would substitute psychology for
[02:01:50.140 --> 02:01:57.900]  religion i would lure priests and pastors into misusing boys and girls and church money if i
[02:01:57.900 --> 02:02:03.500]  were the devil i'd take from those who have and give to those who wanted until i had killed the
[02:02:03.500 --> 02:02:10.060]  incentive of the ambitious i would caution against extremes i'm here to warn people you keep telling
[02:02:10.060 --> 02:02:17.020]  me to shut up this isn't a game in hard work in patriotism in moral conduct i would convince the
[02:02:17.020 --> 02:02:22.940]  young that marriage is old-fashioned that swinging is more fun than what you see on tv is the way to
[02:02:22.940 --> 02:02:30.380]  be and thus i could undress you in public and i could lure you into bed with diseases for which
[02:02:30.380 --> 02:02:46.300]  there is no cure in other words if i were the devil i'd just keep right on doing what he's doing

[02:08:00.700 --> 02:08:09.820]  into this i've given more public comments and more analysis on video than fauci wilinski
[02:08:09.820 --> 02:08:19.900]  ja murthy harris biden combined i've actually given more media analysis than them combined
[02:08:19.900 --> 02:08:25.660]  and one thing you will not find on me is a highlight reel of me flipping and flopping
[02:08:25.660 --> 02:08:32.860]  and flipping and flopping on important issues i've been accurate i've been consistent with america
[02:08:32.860 --> 02:08:40.620]  and i've evolved my analyses as the pandemic data have unfolded and dr yaden and doctors in my
[02:08:40.620 --> 02:08:47.260]  circles we've been completely accurate on this from from spread of the virus on early treatment
[02:08:47.260 --> 02:08:53.580]  and the principles of early treatment on uh on the deficiencies in hospital care and the hospital
[02:08:53.580 --> 02:09:01.180]  is simply too late to save patients and now on the horrendous data we're seeing on the safety of
[02:09:01.180 --> 02:09:07.500]  the vaccines and its loss of really any theoretical efficacy as we sit here today we are now in the
[02:09:07.500 --> 02:09:16.300]  midst of the bq and xbb omicron variants the bivalent boosters have no theoretical coverage
[02:09:16.300 --> 02:09:21.340]  of these variants and we have a situation alex in china where china is actually making things
[02:09:21.340 --> 02:09:29.100]  worse china has had a chinese menu of 12 different vaccines mainly killed virus and antigen based
[02:09:29.100 --> 02:09:34.380]  vaccines and all they've done is they've been an incubator for variants and i know you want to go
[02:09:34.380 --> 02:09:38.300]  to the next level of this but let's talk about some of the victories for lessers because they
[02:09:38.300 --> 02:09:42.300]  they trust you they know you they know you predicted at all you're incredible you know it's
[02:09:42.300 --> 02:09:47.580]  it's dr ye done it's you and it's robert malone you guys are the are the three guys out there
[02:09:47.580 --> 02:09:51.340]  it's not about credit but you've been the hardest working of the three and they've all been very hard
[02:09:51.340 --> 02:09:56.460]  working and you guys have literally helped steer the world out of this with everything you've done
[02:09:56.460 --> 02:10:00.060]  i can track it right back to you guys in our audience as well it's not about credit but it's
[02:10:00.060 --> 02:10:04.940]  about you've you're a leader you've won so that's how humans act with hand the ball the guy that's
[02:10:04.940 --> 02:10:12.220]  the steered us right what is it like to see i mean elon must retweeting you and you're getting
[02:10:12.220 --> 02:10:17.100]  you know not hundreds of thousands but tens of millions of people on your tweets i mean it is
[02:10:17.100 --> 02:10:22.780]  i see that i just share how incredible that is what is it like for the two and a half years of
[02:10:22.780 --> 02:10:27.740]  hell you've gone through you don't talk about it but you off air the persecution it's got to be
[02:10:27.740 --> 02:10:32.380]  satisfying to sacrifice so much so many people that sacrifice never see the liberty of their
[02:10:32.380 --> 02:10:37.900]  lifetime they hope it works in the future you're getting to see huge victory now you know i i was
[02:10:37.900 --> 02:10:45.180]  suspended for twitter for two months and uh on some days i was number one i was trending as the
[02:10:45.180 --> 02:10:52.380]  hashtag number one ahead of the world cup on some days and so it was obvious the world uh wanted my
[02:10:52.380 --> 02:10:56.620]  analysis my opinion it's been enormously gratifying alex i'll just tell you this my tells you god's
[02:10:56.620 --> 02:11:01.900]  real i mean you're you're the underdog it's been gratifying the principles of early treatment
[02:11:02.620 --> 02:11:07.660]  as i originally proposed but it wasn't just me it was vladimir selenco pure quarry paul merrick
[02:11:07.660 --> 02:11:14.460]  there's a team of of worldwide heroes didier realt in france listen this is a worldwide effort the
[02:11:14.460 --> 02:11:21.180]  principles of early treatment we believe have spared millions of lives and tens of millions of
[02:11:21.180 --> 02:11:26.540]  hospitalizations i mean this is one of your protocols might have to die yeah it's a massive
[02:11:26.540 --> 02:11:32.860]  it's absolutely massive that we know it you know as we work through four to six drugs we've really
[02:11:32.860 --> 02:11:38.380]  largely figured this out at the most still one of the most dynamic drugs we have is iver mekton
[02:11:38.380 --> 02:11:45.820]  45 randomized trials all small all showing a signal of benefit roughly a 50 percent reduction in
[02:11:45.820 --> 02:11:52.380]  mortality completely concordant with the icon study one of the original studies was a multicenter
[02:11:52.380 --> 02:11:59.980]  prospective comparative study by gege raster and his wife uh in florida american data iver mekton
[02:11:59.980 --> 02:12:05.900]  published in one of the best journals chest now confirmed and actually vindicated in the full
[02:12:05.900 --> 02:12:10.860]  breadth of data on iver mekton one of many useful drugs we treat the condition and again i go back
[02:12:10.860 --> 02:12:15.660]  to vindication yes you're vindicated on saving lives and exposing the shot but it
[02:12:15.660 --> 02:12:18.620]  it's all coming out that it doesn't work it's all coming out it hurts people
[02:12:18.620 --> 02:12:21.740]  it's all coming out they covered it up it's all coming out they had secret agreements
[02:12:21.740 --> 02:12:26.940]  you said all that years ago but now it's definitely turning against them what do you make of that
[02:12:26.940 --> 02:12:31.740]  well it's so true you know i am under review by the american board of internal medicine
[02:12:32.300 --> 02:12:38.780]  for a bogus covid misinformation policy as they were colluding with fiser maderna through
[02:12:38.780 --> 02:12:44.300]  weber shand with their pr firm one of the things the board uh had challenged me on
[02:12:44.300 --> 02:12:48.700]  is the number of deaths due to the vaccine now it's the number of deaths this is very important
[02:12:48.700 --> 02:12:57.580]  today in bmc infectious diseases a highly uh cited peer reviewed manuscript doctor mark
[02:12:57.580 --> 02:13:04.140]  skidmore michigan state university valid survey asking people what they know about the vaccine
[02:13:04.140 --> 02:13:09.980]  how many people in their constellation do they know injured or worse his estimates based on
[02:13:09.980 --> 02:13:18.380]  very good social science research this is astounding through december of 2021 alex 289
[02:13:18.380 --> 02:13:25.020]  thousand americans estimated to lose their life the code covered 19 vaccine completely concordant
[02:13:25.020 --> 02:13:30.940]  with pantos autos and celibate from columbia using a different methodology which was covered
[02:13:30.940 --> 02:13:37.420]  administration data and us census data they came up with 287 thousand america to totally
[02:13:37.420 --> 02:13:41.900]  different studies using different methodology hitting the same point on december of 2021
[02:13:41.900 --> 02:13:48.300]  now carry this forward just a whole year has gone by we now have in the cdc verus system the cdc is
[02:13:49.180 --> 02:13:56.460]  certifying over 16 000 americans that have died after the vaccine uh i think 22 percent
[02:13:56.460 --> 02:14:02.620]  within the first 48 hours very tightly related to now a long tail of deaths the accepted under
[02:14:02.620 --> 02:14:07.500]  reporting ratio for verus because we if we don't have the vaccine card and all the data we can't
[02:14:07.500 --> 02:14:12.460]  report and many patients die at home and or die in the ambulance we don't have a card the under
[02:14:12.460 --> 02:14:21.500]  reporting factor is 30 30 times 16 000 we're talking north of 450 000 americans is our best
[02:14:21.500 --> 02:14:26.780]  estimate that have died after the co and i think that's conservative because i know so many people
[02:14:26.780 --> 02:14:31.900]  like ernaz from eras and others they get contacted by fema and the government saying change your
[02:14:31.900 --> 02:14:37.980]  story you did not your son did dive in us but you know we we have to wonder where is the outrage
[02:14:37.980 --> 02:14:44.620]  from the parents who've lost children from relatives people in close family circles case
[02:14:44.620 --> 02:14:50.540]  after case after case you know the very first one public figure was hank erin hank erin took the
[02:14:50.540 --> 02:14:56.460]  vaccine uh former baseball grade he dies a few days later and the press had actually disconnected
[02:14:56.460 --> 02:15:02.460]  those two on the on the press release and through 2021 we had prominent figures sometimes the the
[02:15:02.460 --> 02:15:07.580]  press release said they died the vaccine like midwin charles a cnn course dump on a beautiful
[02:15:07.580 --> 02:15:12.380]  african-american woman takes the vaccine dies and the press report says she died the vaccine
[02:15:12.380 --> 02:15:19.020]  what about what about uh william shakespeare that was his name the first man to take it in the
[02:15:19.020 --> 02:15:24.540]  uk he died yeah but you know i didn't know that but there's been challenges how about the uh the
[02:15:24.540 --> 02:15:30.380]  fitness a weight weight weightlifter instructor who said listen if the vaccine uh is is safe i'll
[02:15:30.380 --> 02:15:35.340]  take it and i live but if it's unsafe and i take it and i die it's not safe and he dies you mentioned
[02:15:35.340 --> 02:15:39.100]  now elan must coming out stay there let's come back and you want to talk about the nfl player the
[02:15:39.100 --> 02:15:44.380]  collapse let's do it let's talk about that but you are dominating right now and it is power

[02:20:37.580 --> 02:20:40.860]  bbc the lying liars of lies
[02:20:40.860 --> 02:20:52.540]  so
[02:21:03.500 --> 02:21:09.020]  so 50 60 000 people get outside the bbc this weekend and protest the vaccine desk they
[02:21:09.020 --> 02:21:14.220]  take thousands of photos of people that die from the shot on the windows zero coverage doc i know
[02:21:14.220 --> 02:21:18.620]  you want to give the science and what's coming next but please for the listeners and viewers
[02:21:19.340 --> 02:21:22.780]  you were saying some powerful things during the break about the globalists are really angry right
[02:21:22.780 --> 02:21:30.140]  now you know they have to be wondering how in the world could such a small group of people
[02:21:31.100 --> 02:21:37.260]  with limited resources change world history but in fact that's happening and it's the power of the
[02:21:37.260 --> 02:21:42.540]  truth you heard michael yate and say kryptonite he has an s the same word i use when i went on
[02:21:42.540 --> 02:21:47.100]  joe rogan i set all the records for his show his show that the bottom line is the truth is like
[02:21:47.100 --> 02:21:52.940]  kryptonite at this point in time and you can't stop it look at the protesters outside the bbc
[02:21:52.940 --> 02:22:00.940]  headquarters you know with their signs and this is a human outrage occurring and it's occurring at
[02:22:00.940 --> 02:22:07.660]  the end of a hypodermic needle what we know now is the deaths that are occurring after vaccination
[02:22:07.660 --> 02:22:13.900]  are broad they're worldwide they're occurring with all forms of the vaccine alex and on december
[02:22:13.900 --> 02:22:22.620]  7th 2022 in the u.s senate i concluded the senate panel on vaccination with the call to remove all
[02:22:22.620 --> 02:22:30.060]  vaccines from the market none are safe for human use incredible so i know you want to get the current
[02:22:30.060 --> 02:22:35.180]  science and current warnings you're always about the future but how big what do you make of this
[02:22:35.180 --> 02:22:40.300]  capitulation i mean everybody from scott adams and just thousands of other prominent pro-vaxxers
[02:22:40.300 --> 02:22:44.700]  coming out and saying we were wrong you were right we were set up all the news confirming death
[02:22:44.700 --> 02:22:50.220]  and heart attacks the fba cdc having to admit there's connections to it i mean how would you
[02:22:50.220 --> 02:22:58.380]  quantify that you know the the change is it was clearly going to happen uh because this can't go
[02:22:58.380 --> 02:23:03.980]  on forever the sad thing is how many people have been damaged with these vaccines on my
[02:23:03.980 --> 02:23:09.100]  sub-stack courageous discourse this week alex i summarize a paper by woo and colleagues
[02:23:09.740 --> 02:23:16.300]  from the us fda this is astonishing this is from the us fda and it is concerning the use of the
[02:23:16.300 --> 02:23:22.700]  jansen vaccine in the united states and blood clots and they describe thousands upon thousands of
[02:23:22.700 --> 02:23:28.060]  cases of blood clots in americans some of them alex the blood clots go from the ankle to the
[02:23:28.060 --> 02:23:33.740]  hip this is astonishing these are monster blood clots and 11 percent of the cases were fatal
[02:23:33.740 --> 02:23:38.620]  this is an appublished manuscript by the fda what's the difference between me and the cnn
[02:23:38.620 --> 02:23:44.220]  commentators is that i'm fairly evaluating this and i'm bringing it forward to america and telling
[02:23:44.220 --> 02:23:52.860]  america the truth continue please what we know is that through a series of studies now uh and critical
[02:23:52.860 --> 02:23:58.380]  autopsy studies one by heidel from heidelberg germany by schwaven colleagues the other one by
[02:23:58.380 --> 02:24:03.260]  shaves from columbia two different parts of the world they're looking at patients who have died
[02:24:03.260 --> 02:24:08.300]  after the vaccine so they've died and the families have called for autopsies the corners call for
[02:24:08.300 --> 02:24:16.060]  autopsies they have found in both studies concordant results between 70 and 80 percent of the deaths
[02:24:16.060 --> 02:24:21.660]  are directly due to the vaccines they find a fatal blood clot and and the fda and all the agencies
[02:24:21.660 --> 02:24:29.580]  agree the vaccines cause blood clots they say find fatal heart damage myocarditis uh and a cardiac
[02:24:29.580 --> 02:24:37.180]  source of death or they find devastating stroke or intracranial hemorrhage so the autopsy studies
[02:24:37.180 --> 02:24:42.940]  now are coming in they're implicating the vaccines the regulatory agencies say the vaccines cause
[02:24:42.940 --> 02:24:50.460]  heart damage neurologic damage and blood clots and this leads us up to uh the case of demar hamlin
[02:24:50.460 --> 02:24:55.980]  who has a cardiac arrest on the field uh the monday night football game last game of the year
[02:24:55.980 --> 02:25:01.580]  bills versus Cincinnati you know the nfl has never shut down a game before this is the first time in
[02:25:01.580 --> 02:25:07.020]  history the nfl has a wonderful track record in terms of cardiovascular safety the players are
[02:25:07.020 --> 02:25:13.260]  screened for hypertrophic cardiomyopathy vagular disease significant heart disease they're all
[02:25:13.260 --> 02:25:19.500]  from a cardiovascular perspective in great shape when they get on the field and what i told tucker
[02:25:19.500 --> 02:25:25.820]  carlson within 24 hours of the event later on a week later uh laura ingram on both on fox news
[02:25:25.820 --> 02:25:33.500]  i told them there's a straight line of understanding here that in early 2021 uh the white house and
[02:25:33.500 --> 02:25:39.980]  hhs announced the community cove community core funding program 13 billion dollars go to a whole
[02:25:39.980 --> 02:25:45.660]  variety of organizations in the united states to push the vaccines prominently the nfl takes our
[02:25:45.660 --> 02:25:53.500]  taxpayer dollars then in june of 2021 the fda says the vaccines cause heart damage then in august
[02:25:53.500 --> 02:25:58.780]  of 2021 the nfl says they're going to have a mandate the players don't want it nfl forces on
[02:25:58.780 --> 02:26:04.220]  they run the mandates and the vaccines from august of 2021 to march of 2022 then they drop
[02:26:04.220 --> 02:26:09.660]  everything they drop the vaccines they drop all the covet testing protocols and the nfl says that
[02:26:09.660 --> 02:26:16.460]  95 percent of players are taking the vaccine but prominently erin rogers doesn't take it um uh uh
[02:26:16.460 --> 02:26:21.420]  col beasley doesn't take it uh we have you know prominent players who don't take it a lot of the
[02:26:21.420 --> 02:26:25.740]  senior superstar players don't take it you know cam newton gets forced out of his job at a page
[02:26:25.740 --> 02:26:31.260]  is he doesn't take it at the top the top tennis player doesn't take it novak jokovac doesn't take
[02:26:31.260 --> 02:26:36.620]  it kairi erving you know these guys basically kirk cousins another quarterback doesn't take it
[02:26:36.620 --> 02:26:41.500]  so we have this situation this tension a lot of the young guys probably take it uh demar hamlin
[02:26:41.500 --> 02:26:48.860]  young player for the bills uh early in the game uh makes his tackle and uh we have a situation now
[02:26:48.860 --> 02:26:53.900]  where he gets up he about just his helmet you know he recovers and then he passes out he has a
[02:26:53.900 --> 02:27:01.500]  cardiac arrest i saw it live i was contacting my colleagues on this uh you know he got cpr wonderful
[02:27:01.500 --> 02:27:06.700]  resuscitation on the field the aed says shockable rhythm he's shocked he has a little bit of motion
[02:27:06.700 --> 02:27:12.060]  afterwards that tells me he he's gonna uh again he's gonna recover they wait he's stable in the
[02:27:12.060 --> 02:27:15.980]  paramedic unit in the tunnel and they wait to get his mom out of the stand so that's another
[02:27:15.980 --> 02:27:20.620]  indicator to america that you know he's gonna be okay he gets to the hospital i tell tucker he's
[02:27:20.620 --> 02:27:27.020]  gonna survive uh they're gonna quickly rule out uh heart abnormalities uh in terms of hypertrophic
[02:27:27.020 --> 02:27:32.700]  cardiomyopathy valvular disease again electrolyte abnormalities other things quickly and then when
[02:27:32.700 --> 02:27:37.740]  they have their press conference they literally say we don't know what caused it i told tucker that i
[02:27:37.740 --> 02:27:43.900]  told laura as a cardiologist if he was my patient the first thing i think of is covet 19 vaccine
[02:27:43.900 --> 02:27:49.340]  induced myocarditis and a small scar and then a cardiac arrest related to this because it's
[02:27:49.340 --> 02:27:54.940]  happening in the peer reviewed literature why does it hit prime athletes so hard we think it's part
[02:27:54.940 --> 02:27:58.860]  well hey that hits 90 percent men and 10 percent women so there's has something to do with the
[02:27:58.860 --> 02:28:05.900]  antigen receptors uh in the heart but importantly uh it may be athletes because of myocardial
[02:28:05.900 --> 02:28:11.340]  blood flow and the hemodynamic demands that they have uh and we know the lipid nanoparticles
[02:28:11.340 --> 02:28:15.820]  definitely go in the heart a bowmeyer and colleagues from germany shows the vaccine
[02:28:15.820 --> 02:28:20.540]  and the spike protein in the heart causing damage that's been shown and then we have MRI
[02:28:20.540 --> 02:28:25.260]  studies one by jenna shower two actually by her in pediatrics showing the heart damage is a
[02:28:25.260 --> 02:28:31.580]  identifiable on MRI it's clearly the source of the cardiac arrest wow when we come back
[02:28:32.940 --> 02:28:36.140]  i'm gonna just give you the floor because you've got more points to make them but i've got questions
[02:28:36.140 --> 02:28:41.260]  like how do we give them the offense to punish those that have done this like criminal investigations
[02:28:41.260 --> 02:28:46.300]  in japan criminal investigations in places like florida other ones around the world how do we go
[02:28:46.300 --> 02:28:51.340]  on the offense to make them stop rolling out the next power grab stay with us under peter mccullis

[02:33:02.700 --> 02:33:15.020]  the new world order it's alex jones from the front lines of the information war it's alex jones
[02:33:15.020 --> 02:33:19.420]  all right if you go back five years ago we played the c-span club of fauci with all the big
[02:33:19.420 --> 02:33:24.140]  heads of the federal agencies with health saying we're going to blow up the old system
[02:33:24.140 --> 02:33:28.940]  for the use of virus out of china to bring him in m rna we're going to get get rid of the approval
[02:33:28.940 --> 02:33:34.380]  process and now they've announced at debos oh we're getting rid of the approval process we've got
[02:33:34.380 --> 02:33:39.900]  cancer m rna shots we've got stuff for drug abuse stuff for depression stuff for everything we're
[02:33:39.900 --> 02:33:45.020]  going to make you take all these experimental shots so i was talking to peter mccullough in the break
[02:33:45.020 --> 02:33:49.420]  and he said it's gonna be the biggest i told you someone history but i want to talk about something
[02:33:49.420 --> 02:33:55.260]  he didn't even bring up but i know there's a lot of great telemedicine out there but this guy
[02:33:55.260 --> 02:34:01.420]  with a great ceo out of canada he was on tucker carlson about it has brought out the best telemedicine
[02:34:01.420 --> 02:34:06.380]  out there i'm personally using it mccullough didn't come here to plug this but i'm gonna plug it
[02:34:06.380 --> 02:34:11.260]  because it saved my dad it saved a bunch of my family it saved a bunch of people early on when
[02:34:11.260 --> 02:34:15.500]  these guys were just on the phone calling pharmacies and getting people to give people's things they
[02:34:15.500 --> 02:34:20.060]  needed that they were told by the media don't give ivermectin don't give hydroxychloroquine
[02:34:20.060 --> 02:34:25.420]  don't give budesodine or whatever you call it a terrible steroids and it pisses me off because
[02:34:25.420 --> 02:34:30.700]  these are lightly controlled substances very easy to get prescriptions for like inhalers they were
[02:34:30.700 --> 02:34:36.620]  blocking it but not just those anything you need next level online medicine this is the future
[02:34:36.620 --> 02:34:42.620]  something great trump did was make this the law so if you go to online health now dot com

[02:34:51.820 --> 02:34:56.620]  with the folks working with tucker carlson and you know the the ceo they had on you know aside from
[02:34:56.620 --> 02:35:00.940]  dr mccullough but but i'm going to make you talk about this company and the great work you're doing
[02:35:00.940 --> 02:35:06.460]  because you're persecuted you're attacked you've saved millions of lives and who doesn't want you

[02:36:23.660 --> 02:36:30.140]  the the encounter the bad stuff but because he trusted the system he also pushed what the bad guys
[02:36:30.140 --> 02:36:35.660]  were doing that's why it's important to write this down and have this and and and be ready so you

[02:37:04.140 --> 02:37:10.780]  this month they've announced a dental a dental network now companies are bringing on the wellness
[02:37:10.780 --> 02:37:17.180]  company as a benefit because it's a cell phone app people for ten dollars a month get access through
[02:37:17.180 --> 02:37:22.780]  the cell phone to what they need in terms of a doctor when they need them and this is a revolution
[02:37:22.780 --> 02:37:27.580]  bypass all the controlled people and go right to the folks that have stood up for humanity
[02:37:27.580 --> 02:37:32.620]  and get great services at the same time it's so true and you know far and away the most popular
[02:37:32.620 --> 02:37:40.060]  question or the most popular product is dr vanda waters detoxification supplement that features
[02:37:40.060 --> 02:37:47.020]  natto kinase natto kinase is a japanese discovery it's a natural uh proteolytic enzyme well the
[02:37:47.020 --> 02:37:53.180]  japanese discover so much stuff they do and this one is the only enzyme that we're aware of right
[02:37:53.180 --> 02:37:58.140]  now that dissolves the spike protein this is very important the spike protein is loaded in the body
[02:37:58.140 --> 02:38:02.780]  with the cova 19 infection and definitely with the vaccines it looks like it takes a long time
[02:38:02.780 --> 02:38:06.780]  for the body to get rid of it so I keep looking for a mitigator this is it tell us about it the
[02:38:06.780 --> 02:38:12.700]  dr vanda water supplement features natto kinase uh i recommend it twice a day it also has selenium
[02:38:12.700 --> 02:38:19.740]  and some other uh natural herbs and supplements it uh she's a pharmacist on our team she designed it
[02:38:20.300 --> 02:38:25.740]  and it's supported by preclinical science we need obviously human clinical studies but it's an
[02:38:25.740 --> 02:38:31.500]  available supplement now people are looking for anything else i've tried prescription drugs i've
[02:38:31.500 --> 02:38:37.500]  tried ivermectin uh hydroxychloroquine i've tried steroids fluvoxamine i we can't see by the way
[02:38:37.500 --> 02:38:42.380]  anybody saying cova doesn't real hasn't had it i i'm as healthy as a horse i get sick like every
[02:38:42.380 --> 02:38:48.540]  10 years i've been around 48 years 49 now i've never experienced sickness like this it's true
[02:38:48.540 --> 02:38:53.180]  you can imagine what if you were you know 89 you can see how you went down but i'm talking about
[02:38:53.180 --> 02:38:58.380]  this problem of now after the vaccines in multiple bouts of cova people are lower with the spike
[02:38:58.380 --> 02:39:03.500]  protein they don't feel well they have a variety of constitutional symptoms this is a potential
[02:39:03.500 --> 02:39:09.660]  solution we're clearly going to try to advance the science here so they go to online now online
[02:39:09.660 --> 02:39:13.580]  healthnow.com that's a URL so we get some of the support they go there at least from right to the

[02:39:32.220 --> 02:39:39.020]  hydroxychloroquine comes from a natural substance so does ivermectin and now natokinase isn't it
[02:39:39.020 --> 02:39:45.900]  interesting natural substances in a sense combating this man-made disaster sars-cov-2 in the vaccines
[02:39:45.900 --> 02:39:50.060]  online healthnow.com thank you for your support and thank you for getting into that because it's
[02:39:50.060 --> 02:39:54.140]  important you didn't come here to do that but i made you do it continue now with the big news
[02:39:54.140 --> 02:40:00.140]  vindicated it's all coming out you were saying during the break that the the leader just panicked
[02:40:00.940 --> 02:40:08.060]  well you know what we've witnessed is that this in our book courage to face COVID-19 we
[02:40:08.060 --> 02:40:13.740]  described the biopharmaceutical complex this alignment of the world economic forum the gays
[02:40:13.740 --> 02:40:19.260]  foundation the welcome trust the Rockefeller foundation and sepi the coalition of epidemic
[02:40:19.260 --> 02:40:27.340]  preparedness and innovation gavi unitate the worldwide federal agencies pharma and the suppliers
[02:40:27.340 --> 02:40:34.860]  they've basically coalesced around a complex and they are singularly focused on vaccination and
[02:40:34.860 --> 02:40:44.460]  particularly genetic vaccination as a means of influencing world health as they pose it in the
[02:40:44.460 --> 02:40:50.620]  davos meeting we analyze the agenda alexa turns out only 22 of the world economic forum meeting
[02:40:50.620 --> 02:40:57.020]  is on economics the rest of it is on science fiction it's on some type of view that it's a
[02:40:57.020 --> 02:41:01.420]  death it's a science fiction death cult and notice i've played three clips from it where they said
[02:41:01.420 --> 02:41:06.140]  we're going to fix your genetics with mrna so they're admitting they're changing our genetics
[02:41:06.140 --> 02:41:11.580]  there you go and i tell you it is a disaster we've now learned that this messenger RNA looks like
[02:41:11.580 --> 02:41:17.660]  it's permanent the three prime and five prime caps on the end the nucleoside interlock caps do not
[02:41:17.660 --> 02:41:23.820]  get digested by human enzymes they actually enhance reverse transcriptase by endogenous enzyme called
[02:41:23.820 --> 02:41:31.020]  line one this means that this code is then transcribed into your permanent dna then passed down
[02:41:31.020 --> 02:41:35.020]  from parent cells to daughters which i'm not assigned as like you but that's quite defeat they
[02:41:35.020 --> 02:41:41.900]  thought that couldn't be done before well and it is it is a it is the biological misadventure of
[02:41:41.900 --> 02:41:48.380]  you know our lifetimes if not for all time messenger RNA is off to a disastrous start
[02:41:48.380 --> 02:41:54.300]  and now all these leaders are proposing that you know it become part of influenza vaccination
[02:41:54.300 --> 02:41:59.420]  other bible vaccinations actually therapeutics for heart failure and i've given commentary on this
[02:41:59.420 --> 02:42:05.260]  this is a disaster messenger RNA ought to be black box don't you love how maderna is like we got a
[02:42:05.260 --> 02:42:10.940]  problem for all the heart attacks now well maderna yeah maderna has now i think four dozen different
[02:42:10.940 --> 02:42:17.420]  product lines the whole reason why maderna even got going is us our taxpayer dollars filled their
[02:42:17.420 --> 02:42:24.060]  coffers and at this point in time watch out for anything that's made with messenger RNA it's bad
[02:42:24.060 --> 02:42:29.580]  business folks go to online health now dot com online health now dot com see all mccullis reports

[02:47:41.340 --> 02:47:45.660]  all right dr. peter mccullough you've got tons of science to cover we'll have 15 minutes the next
[02:47:45.660 --> 02:47:50.780]  hour for the s.o. takes over you're so gracious to be here but you will not toot your horn you
[02:47:50.780 --> 02:47:56.060]  do is oh this scientist is right that scientist is right yeah they all get credit but most people
[02:47:56.060 --> 02:48:00.060]  don't get to see victory in their lifetime this whole agenda is falling apart criminal
[02:48:00.060 --> 02:48:04.380]  investigations are everywhere the agencies are saying we got lied to they're blaming big pharma
[02:48:04.380 --> 02:48:09.740]  who they should blame but big pharma took control the regulatory system how would you define this
[02:48:09.740 --> 02:48:13.820]  moment we're at and then again at all the other points it's astonishing at the regulatory level
[02:48:13.820 --> 02:48:19.500]  and the the state and federal level state by state i anticipate there's going to be grand juries
[02:48:19.500 --> 02:48:25.180]  investigations public health officials losing their jobs florida ronda santis announcing
[02:48:25.180 --> 02:48:29.980]  grand jury investigations things going on actually in oregon mississippi so many others
[02:48:29.980 --> 02:48:35.420]  federal investigation in japan yeah federal in japan you know and at the uh our federal level
[02:48:35.420 --> 02:48:41.980]  we know there will be congressional investigation lots of planning for this now remember congress
[02:48:41.980 --> 02:48:49.020]  oversees the fda the fda has had a huge degree of culpability in this and not pulling the vaccines
[02:48:49.020 --> 02:48:53.820]  off the market in my view they should have been pulled off the market in january of 2021
[02:48:53.820 --> 02:49:00.860]  as phaser accrued 1,223 deaths within 90 days of release of their vaccine the swine flu got
[02:49:00.860 --> 02:49:05.580]  pulled over three deaths well yeah initially it went up to about 25 is when they made the call
[02:49:05.580 --> 02:49:12.220]  to pull it it went up to 53 550 cases of gambray that's with the president ford and the swine
[02:49:12.220 --> 02:49:17.180]  flu vaccine that's with no bears no so three triggered the investigation 50 did it right
[02:49:17.180 --> 02:49:24.220]  four in the end it was 53 was the tally well we've phaser ran this tally up 1,223 the fda
[02:49:24.220 --> 02:49:31.740]  knew about it and the fda their lawyer wanted to block release of that dossier for 55 years
[02:49:31.740 --> 02:49:36.620]  that in a loan it by itself ought to be the investigative showpiece who had phaser on the
[02:49:36.620 --> 02:49:41.500]  face here why would you try to hide that yeah who had phaser knew who had the fda knew and why
[02:49:41.500 --> 02:49:45.580]  they didn't shut this down but else i gotta tell you the single grass question i get
[02:49:45.580 --> 02:49:51.260]  is from really good people who took the vaccine early because they were told to they were told
[02:49:51.260 --> 02:49:54.700]  it was the right thing i get this too if like you wanted to get i'm sorry to interrupt you
[02:49:54.700 --> 02:49:59.500]  absolutely on the street everywhere okay i took the shot are you mad at me no i've done things
[02:49:59.500 --> 02:50:03.500]  i've been conned i've been wrong i i mean i i've funded abortions when i was a teenager i was
[02:50:03.500 --> 02:50:07.740]  wrong i don't know what's killing my kids i'm sorry i repent nobody's mad at people that took
[02:50:07.740 --> 02:50:12.620]  the shots we understand you're victims we have a great degree of compassion i have to tell you
[02:50:12.620 --> 02:50:19.180]  in my office every day are victims of the vaccine people with dozens of cases of myocarditis blood
[02:50:19.180 --> 02:50:24.540]  clots uh amputations i've seen horrific things in my in my practice with the vaccines we have a
[02:50:24.540 --> 02:50:28.700]  tremendous amount of compassion i think a couple important points for those of you in the audience
[02:50:28.700 --> 02:50:35.740]  who've taken the vaccines first thing is it looks like the damage is cumulative so the first point
[02:50:35.740 --> 02:50:41.740]  is don't take any more of these shots because each shot is loading the body with the woo hand spike
[02:50:41.740 --> 02:50:46.460]  protein which we know is damaging and then cumulative you're probably lethal so first and
[02:50:46.460 --> 02:50:52.460]  foremost no more shots absolutely doesn't matter what brand no more it's gotta stop the second point
[02:50:52.460 --> 02:50:57.980]  is vigilance alex people have to be vigilant they've taken three or four shots they go on a
[02:50:57.980 --> 02:51:03.260]  long a plane trip and the lake starts it gets swollen think blood clot these cause blood clots
[02:51:03.260 --> 02:51:08.060]  look at look at al rocher our favorite weatherman he takes three or four shots uh ends up with blood
[02:51:08.060 --> 02:51:13.820]  clots his fall hospitalized white herb kerke street a favorite espn announcer vaccine blood
[02:51:13.820 --> 02:51:18.940]  clots deon sanders family history of blood clotting disorder he gets arterial blood clots
[02:51:18.940 --> 02:51:24.700]  he has nine surgeries multiple amputations he'll never walk and run normally again jeez be vigilant
[02:51:24.700 --> 02:51:32.540]  so the other thing is heart damage so people who are having uh uh shortness of breath chest pain
[02:51:32.540 --> 02:51:38.460]  they've taken a vaccine uh do not blow it off this is the time to see your doctor get the appropriate
[02:51:38.460 --> 02:51:45.100]  blood test ekg and other tests we think there's an opportunity here to save lives now but people
[02:51:45.100 --> 02:51:50.380]  have to be activated uh wellness company is a great portal to get in can make referrals
[02:51:51.180 --> 02:51:55.500]  get things going but you're gonna need to see doctors on the ground for this these vaccine
[02:51:55.500 --> 02:52:02.220]  injuries are serious please continue i've got a lot of questions but i want to interrupt you here's
[02:52:02.220 --> 02:52:08.140]  the next point everyone's looking for detoxification we talked about nato kinase it needs clinical
[02:52:08.140 --> 02:52:14.220]  trials we need to push for request for applications for clinical trials we need clinical trials in a
[02:52:14.220 --> 02:52:21.500]  whole array of areas to see how we can get this detoxification process going uh there seems to be
[02:52:21.500 --> 02:52:28.460]  the right now no ready answers on how to get the vaccine out of the the human body uh what we are
[02:52:28.460 --> 02:52:35.180]  looking for is we're looking for opportunities for people to push foundations to push our federal
[02:52:35.180 --> 02:52:43.340]  government uh to have vaccine injury research centers we need screening detection diagnosis
[02:52:43.340 --> 02:52:49.340]  prognosis in in management everybody should be now pushing their senators a congressman
[02:52:49.340 --> 02:52:56.780]  for vaccine injury care the zogby survey done last summer i think was so impressive
[02:52:56.780 --> 02:53:01.420]  a valid representative survey of americans two-thirds of americans took the vaccine in the zogby
[02:53:01.420 --> 02:53:06.540]  survey 15 percent of americans say they have some new medical problem because they took a
[02:53:06.540 --> 02:53:12.620]  covid-19 vaccine let me raise the coroners in europe and australia new zealand the u.s canada u k
[02:53:13.420 --> 02:53:17.180]  they say they've never pulled blood clots even out of young people that look like this
[02:53:17.180 --> 02:53:22.940]  and then the scientists say it's it's not really protein from the blood you're an expert on this
[02:53:22.940 --> 02:53:29.580]  one i know it's hard to quantify what is it what what we think is going on is uh you know we know
[02:53:29.580 --> 02:53:35.740]  about the fda publication now by woo and colleagues now focused on the jansen vaccine thousands and
[02:53:35.740 --> 02:53:41.500]  thousands of people not not post mortem but actually living people with giant blood clots
[02:53:41.500 --> 02:53:46.060]  woo from the fda and it's on my courageous discourse sub stack published in peer literature
[02:53:46.060 --> 02:53:54.860]  is describing ankle to hip blood clots in people 11 percent of them are fatal now what the undertakers
[02:53:54.860 --> 02:54:01.500]  are reporting could be post mortem uh findings what we know inside these blood clots is the spike
[02:54:01.500 --> 02:54:06.140]  protein this sure they're not pathologists but the point is they're seeing things they never
[02:54:06.140 --> 02:54:11.340]  pulled out of people right well normally when the human body dies the body the blood is liquefied
[02:54:11.340 --> 02:54:14.940]  they cannulate the blood vessels and actually the blood is drained out of the body and a
[02:54:14.940 --> 02:54:20.220]  perfusion goes in to preserve the body they were finding that the blood wasn't flowing and they
[02:54:20.220 --> 02:54:25.100]  actually dissected the vessels to figure out why and there are these post mortem blood clots developing
[02:54:25.100 --> 02:54:28.540]  sure so they're they're not a sign it's like you they're just saying we never seen this
[02:54:28.540 --> 02:54:33.580]  it is it's new now again this is in the era of we've had covid and we've had the vaccines
[02:54:33.580 --> 02:54:38.220]  they're reporting it during the epoch of the vaccines but remember most people with covid
[02:54:38.220 --> 02:54:44.700]  in 2021 and 2022 we're vaccinated so they've had both exposures i think at this point in time
[02:54:44.700 --> 02:54:49.580]  it's likely what they're describing is post mortem we haven't seen any analysis stratified
[02:54:49.580 --> 02:54:54.380]  according to vaccinated unvaccinated covid or not covid i don't think it's likely post mortem
[02:54:54.380 --> 02:55:01.980]  but the the fda recent publication by woo and colleagues describing giant blood clots in living
[02:55:01.980 --> 02:55:08.380]  human beings is i think should be noted sure so what happens that if it's post mortem how is blood
[02:55:08.380 --> 02:55:13.580]  different now with the shots or with covid that makes it do this it's loaded with the spike protein
[02:55:13.580 --> 02:55:18.940]  the spike protein drives blood clots and on top of that elix the spike protein folds it's
[02:55:18.940 --> 02:55:24.220]  considered to be amyloid genic amyloid genic there's about 32 proteins known in human body
[02:55:24.220 --> 02:55:30.140]  that fold when they do it becomes rubber like amyloid means rubber in the pathology lab
[02:55:30.140 --> 02:55:36.300]  an amyloid heart or amyloid organ is rubberized these blood clots are rubberized what i'm finding
[02:55:36.300 --> 02:55:40.540]  in my clinical practice is i have some patients with giant blood clots i'm using blood thinners
[02:55:40.540 --> 02:55:44.860]  it's been over a year they're not dissolving well that's what i saw in the literature is it's not
[02:55:44.860 --> 02:55:49.420]  working though like well it's not just that it's not just that undertakers are saying we've never
[02:55:49.420 --> 02:55:52.940]  seen this the doctors never seen this right i mean i have a patient in my current practice right
[02:55:52.940 --> 02:55:58.220]  now the radiologist called me 14 inch blood clot i've never seen a 14 inch blood clot normally
[02:55:58.220 --> 02:56:03.980]  these are a centimeter or two so do we know what the shots are doing then the shots are causing
[02:56:03.980 --> 02:56:09.820]  tremendous production of the spike protein the spike protein itself is stimulating blood clot
[02:56:09.820 --> 02:56:15.020]  formation while it damages the inner lining of blood vessels once the blood clots form they become
[02:56:15.020 --> 02:56:22.300]  giant blood clots and they're loaded with the spike protein dr yedin says it's all premeditated
[02:56:22.300 --> 02:56:27.660]  i mean looking back at this i saw the studies at ut in 2014 on that whole initiative it killed
[02:56:27.660 --> 02:56:32.380]  half the racks lived half as long they described all this so they i mean i got on a scientist like
[02:56:32.380 --> 02:56:37.900]  you but it looks pretty premeditated doc i know i can't assess motive i can just tell you these
[02:56:37.900 --> 02:56:44.460]  vaccines and remember darpa the research unit of the military announced in 2012 they were going to
[02:56:44.460 --> 02:56:50.700]  use messenger RNA to end pandemics in 60 days that was the adept p3 program it's on the darpa
[02:56:50.700 --> 02:56:58.060]  website we know that in 2005 that the prep act listed all these diseases that they were going to
[02:56:58.060 --> 02:57:02.940]  have a covered countermeasures on united states has been getting ready for biological warfare
[02:57:02.940 --> 02:57:09.420]  for quite some time the sars-cov-2 program of both the threat sars-cov-2 and the answers vaccines
[02:57:09.420 --> 02:57:15.180]  and monoclonal antibodies has been in development easily since 2012 and whatever happened in the
[02:57:15.180 --> 02:57:21.260]  lab in wuhan china it's been a disaster i think honestly that the lab in china was a contractor
[02:57:21.260 --> 02:57:26.620]  they're a contractor for uh this u.s research it went bad by the way that's the consensus now
[02:57:26.620 --> 02:57:31.500]  that i i love i mean i love america i hate the shotguns but criminal elements in our government
[02:57:31.500 --> 02:57:36.060]  were using that as a cutout or a place to do this it looks like it in fact let's talk about it two
[02:57:36.060 --> 02:57:42.780]  more segments with dr peter mccullough on fire today wow i mean this is just a total vindication
[02:57:43.340 --> 02:57:44.780]  online health now dot com

[03:00:06.540 --> 03:00:11.340]  minutes segment after the break one minute so dr peter mccullough so i'm not asking the questions
[03:00:11.340 --> 03:00:18.060]  is about to host this segment and the next i'll be here to traffic cock a traffic cop please doctor
[03:00:18.060 --> 03:00:24.620]  so many people ask me dr mccullough how could the world have gotten in this type of place
[03:00:25.340 --> 03:00:31.340]  where we're in a situation where it almost seems like it's a government operation against
[03:00:32.300 --> 03:00:38.140]  its own people in every country in the world simultaneously and what we see from a macro
[03:00:38.140 --> 03:00:45.020]  level is the countries that allow doctors and other health care providers to be independent
[03:00:45.020 --> 03:00:50.300]  they didn't sign on to this vaccine agenda they're coming out looking great including
[03:00:50.300 --> 03:00:57.260]  Haiti including ivory coast many countries in africa recent analysis on my uh my twitter feed
[03:00:57.260 --> 03:01:04.220]  shows that africa is coming out great pretty much covet nineteen is over with why because they
[03:01:04.220 --> 03:01:10.380]  didn't take covet nineteen vaccines is very important the covet nineteen vaccines and analyses
[03:01:10.380 --> 03:01:18.220]  published by supermanian uh camp and beady create more cases of covet nineteen and increase covet
[03:01:18.220 --> 03:01:24.700]  mortality how do they do that the covet nineteen vaccines misdirect the immune system so the immune
[03:01:24.700 --> 03:01:31.020]  system is not ready to handle the next version of SARS-CoV-2 it actually gets a more severe case
[03:01:31.020 --> 03:01:36.220]  patients are more communicable with one another they spread the virus more readily when they take
[03:01:36.220 --> 03:01:42.060]  the vaccines essentially the vaccines have backfired and so we've gotten to a situation
[03:01:42.060 --> 03:01:48.140]  that the more vaccines that are taken the worse the countries do analyses out of australia now
[03:01:48.140 --> 03:01:56.140]  on some hospital senses it's 99 if not 100 of australians in the hospital covet nineteen
[03:01:56.140 --> 03:02:03.180]  are fully vaccinated we know in that country wisely 10 of people in australia have not taken
[03:02:03.180 --> 03:02:09.660]  a vaccine so it's the unvaccinated in australia that look terrific i'm going there in a couple weeks
[03:02:09.660 --> 03:02:14.460]  i'm going to work with australians multiple cities and we're going to go over the data together
[03:02:14.460 --> 03:02:21.100]  it's astonishing that covet nineteen vaccination has backfired to the extent it has people have
[03:02:21.100 --> 03:02:28.300]  said how did this terrible idea about messenger RNA coding for the spike protein or adenoviral
[03:02:28.300 --> 03:02:37.740]  DNA or actually just giving the killed viral virus itself or the spike protein antigen
[03:02:37.740 --> 03:02:45.740]  why is that such a bad idea because in this case the spike protein is the most mutagenic part of
[03:02:45.740 --> 03:02:51.660]  the virus the virus literally looks at what the vaccines do and the virus laughs at it
[03:02:51.660 --> 03:02:58.540]  and quickly is able to mutate and get around the vaccines and each time that virus then is is actually
[03:02:58.540 --> 03:03:04.540]  able to reinfect somebody who took the vaccine and sadly is able to reinfect somebody who's
[03:03:04.540 --> 03:03:09.900]  already recovered from covet nineteen remember the majority of people who've developed covet in
[03:03:09.900 --> 03:03:17.340]  2021 and 2022 are fully vaccinated so they have both the exposures of the vaccine as well as covet
[03:03:17.340 --> 03:03:21.900]  so they keep loading the body with spike protein and that's where we're seeing the killment of risks
[03:03:21.900 --> 03:03:28.060]  particularly of myocarditis blood clots and neurologic damage so you know neither one is
[03:03:28.060 --> 03:03:33.980]  good neither the the respiratory infection or the vaccine sadly many people are getting both
[03:03:34.780 --> 03:03:40.140]  it looks like there's a military origin to this and when the vaccines were rolled out in the
[03:03:40.140 --> 03:03:45.260]  united states it was health and human services that announced that there was an emergency to
[03:03:45.260 --> 03:03:51.500]  justify the EUA and then the Department of Defense. Pfizer, Moderna, Johnson, Johnson, Novavax
[03:03:51.500 --> 03:03:57.900]  they're suppliers in a sense they're marketing shields and what we now know is that the vaccines
[03:03:57.900 --> 03:04:04.380]  themselves are manufactured by defense contractors right you know prominently Moderna its product
[03:04:04.380 --> 03:04:09.980]  is made by a company called Resilience they have a big plant outside of Mississauga Ontario
[03:04:09.980 --> 03:04:17.420]  under emergency use authorization the vaccines are not inspected the FDA can't inspect them
[03:04:17.420 --> 03:04:22.060]  even Moderna, Pfizer, the other companies they can't inspect them the final fill and finish is done
[03:04:22.060 --> 03:04:28.940]  by defense contractor that is so unprecedented and we now have great concerns that the quantity
[03:04:28.940 --> 03:04:34.620]  and purity of messenger RNA is not equal in each file and that's the reason why some vials and some
[03:04:34.620 --> 03:04:40.220]  lots are far more deadly than others. Wow we're going to come back final segment we're going to host that as well
[03:04:40.220 --> 03:04:48.540]  what are you going to hit? We're going to touch on the final analysis of where we're going next in
[03:04:48.540 --> 03:04:53.180]  terms of who's taking boosters and what's happening. All right and Peter McCullough is our guest
[03:04:53.180 --> 03:04:55.500]  back in 60 seconds to everybody tune in now.
[03:04:58.060 --> 03:05:02.700]  In full wars is winning. In full wars is reaching more people than ever. We were supposed to be
[03:05:02.700 --> 03:05:07.420]  off the air months and months and months ago mainstream media told you but it's not true
[03:05:07.420 --> 03:05:11.580]  they told you we were going to be shut down they told you we owed a billion and a half dollars
[03:05:11.580 --> 03:05:16.060]  none of that's true it's all being appealed they want you to think info wars is dead
[03:05:16.060 --> 03:05:20.940]  but if you simply stand up and support info wars we've got years and years of appeals
[03:05:20.940 --> 03:05:25.340]  and we will not be taken off the air but if they can convince you that we've been shut down
[03:05:25.340 --> 03:05:29.740]  they're going to win don't let the globalist sigh up you and your family go to info wars
[03:05:29.740 --> 03:05:34.380]  store.com and get incredible products, supplements, books, films, t-shirts, you name it that fund
[03:05:34.380 --> 03:05:39.420]  the info war and empower your life and let the globalist know their sigh up has not worked.
[03:05:39.420 --> 03:05:45.900]  Thanks for keeping us on air take action at infowarstore.com today because the only people
[03:05:45.900 --> 03:05:50.700]  that can take us off the air is you the viewers and listeners the majority of you have not been
[03:05:50.700 --> 03:06:16.220]  sidelined but some of you have do not let the globalist brainwash you go to infowarstore.com to keep us on the air the answer to 1984 is 1776 live from austin texas broadcasting worldwide it's alex jones and i'm just shutting up so dr.
[03:06:16.220 --> 03:06:21.580]  peter bacullo can host the show folks love it we got 10 minutes left to the second sir
[03:06:21.580 --> 03:06:25.660]  during that one minute break you were on fire repeat all that i was like stop saying this saying on air
[03:06:26.220 --> 03:06:32.060]  there seems to be a madness that's taken over the world on vaccines i was astonished to learn
[03:06:33.020 --> 03:06:39.340]  on a veirs report vaccine event reporting system report that a six month old baby
[03:06:39.340 --> 03:06:51.340]  at the same administration received the dpt the mmr influenza vaccine pneumococcal vaccine
[03:06:52.060 --> 03:07:00.460]  and the covet 19 vaccine all at once it's in the veirs record and a six month old baby died two days later
[03:07:00.460 --> 03:07:09.820]  now doctors parents and lay people need to understand the human body can only take so much
[03:07:10.540 --> 03:07:18.780]  this is in a sense vaccinating to death vaccinating to death every vaccine ought to be considered
[03:07:18.780 --> 03:07:26.860]  seriously every vaccine has risks and benefits every vaccine even the old ones deserve some
[03:07:26.860 --> 03:07:32.700]  re appraisal we need to reevaluate these i personally i've taken every vaccine i followed
[03:07:32.700 --> 03:07:37.820]  every single one on the schedule i traveled to india a few years ago i'm going back there uh next
[03:07:37.820 --> 03:07:44.300]  week i've taken additional vaccines to go to india and travel i am you know fully accept vaccines i
[03:07:44.300 --> 03:07:51.580]  am not anti-vax but when it came to the covet 19 vaccines i didn't take it and and not taking the
[03:07:51.580 --> 03:08:00.060]  covet 19 vaccine was the smartest health decision i ever made our cdc says sadly only 17 percent of
[03:08:00.060 --> 03:08:08.620]  americans have not taken any covet 19 vaccine it turns out about a third of americans uh uh only
[03:08:08.620 --> 03:08:14.700]  took uh you know either zero or one shots that means two thirds took the full set but where we
[03:08:14.700 --> 03:08:22.220]  are now with our cdc indicates that only 15 percent of americans are keeping up on the bivalent booster
[03:08:22.220 --> 03:08:28.700]  shots and i think this is very wise david wiseman former j&j scientists who's testified
[03:08:28.700 --> 03:08:35.740]  at the us fda is worried because the bivalent boosters not only are half coded for the original
[03:08:35.740 --> 03:08:41.820]  wuhan spike protein but also produce spike protein against ba4 and ba5 these are different
[03:08:41.820 --> 03:08:49.260]  spike proteins they can interact with one another and to make matters worse ba4 and ba5 is gone it
[03:08:49.260 --> 03:08:55.500]  actually left america through the fall so the current bivalent boosters which failed in animal
[03:08:55.500 --> 03:09:02.220]  studies to stop SARS-CoV-2 gave a surrogate rise in antibodies which the antibodies are unfortunately
[03:09:02.220 --> 03:09:10.940]  an unreliable surrogate for disease prevention the ba4 ba5 variants are gone now we have been
[03:09:10.940 --> 03:09:16.220]  replaced we have the bq variant and the xbb they're the predominant variants in the united states and
[03:09:16.220 --> 03:09:21.340]  my sub stack uh i indicate in the last week that they represent probably three quarters of all the
[03:09:21.340 --> 03:09:28.060]  variants i believe they're slightly more virulent and we're seeing this out of china we're china's
[03:09:28.060 --> 03:09:33.740]  having a large current prevalence pool of those sick and because it's a big country and they have a
[03:09:33.740 --> 03:09:40.620]  lot of people they do have a lot of hospitalizations and proportionally higher deaths because uh it's
[03:09:40.620 --> 03:09:47.020]  such a big country and so many people are sick at the same time but our current bivalent boosters
[03:09:47.020 --> 03:09:54.860]  have no theoretical coverage of working against SARS-CoV-2 i can tell you i would expect as a doctor
[03:09:54.860 --> 03:10:02.300]  that taking a covid-19 bivalent booster shot would provide zero protection and we're starting to see
[03:10:03.260 --> 03:10:08.380]  example after example a recent paper by shretha and colleagues from the cleveland clinic shows
[03:10:08.380 --> 03:10:13.900]  that the lowest risk group in the cleveland clinic are those who've taken none of these shots
[03:10:14.460 --> 03:10:18.860]  and then the next higher risk is one shot two shots and therefore those who've taken the most
[03:10:18.860 --> 03:10:25.740]  shots have the highest risk of getting covid in the cleveland clinic workforce that's now been fully
[03:10:26.380 --> 03:10:34.300]  revealed we have additional data across canada the uk uh scotland south africa and australia
[03:10:34.300 --> 03:10:41.820]  uh that the more shots that are taken the higher chances of getting the illness hospitalization
[03:10:41.820 --> 03:10:46.620]  and death in every single analysis the unvaccinated look the best now people have said well what's
[03:10:46.620 --> 03:10:52.700]  unique about being unvaccinated uh that can be more likely to be younger fitter and stronger
[03:10:52.700 --> 03:10:58.860]  people obviously you know we're discerning but also largely people who uh may have had covid-19
[03:10:58.860 --> 03:11:03.900]  early on that was my circumstance and i felt listen i was already through the illness i already had
[03:11:03.900 --> 03:11:08.620]  natural immunity so we have great news on natural immunity probably the single most
[03:11:08.620 --> 03:11:14.860]  important paper that i saw uh emerged in the last few months was published by chin and colleagues
[03:11:14.860 --> 03:11:23.660]  new england journal of medicine in late october of 2022 59 000 prisoners 17 000 staff in a congregate
[03:11:23.660 --> 03:11:28.540]  setting so they knew every single case and they knew who got hospitalized and died the important
[03:11:28.540 --> 03:11:35.580]  point is if someone's already had covid in the delta or the omicron epics of the pandemic
[03:11:36.780 --> 03:11:43.420]  that there was a negligible risk of hospitalization and death and in that study in chin when i mean
[03:11:43.420 --> 03:11:50.140]  negligible there were zero hospitalizations and deaths in those who had previously had covid and
[03:11:50.140 --> 03:11:55.420]  were naturally immune when they got another case of covid and it didn't matter whether or not they
[03:11:55.420 --> 03:12:01.180]  took a vaccine doc you said that two and a half years ago so you're vindicated again but that's
[03:12:01.180 --> 03:12:06.380]  a known scientific fact what about the prosecutions what about nuremberg two what about stopping them
[03:12:06.380 --> 03:12:13.180]  launching their next attack we have to have full out investigations at this point in time i think
[03:12:13.180 --> 03:12:21.660]  all roads lead to davos switzerland there ought to be really i think a um uh a a a census of who
[03:12:21.660 --> 03:12:29.420]  goes to the world economic forum meetings i think fully deposed what as an organized crime network
[03:12:29.420 --> 03:12:34.460]  what's what's said at this you know people have said well how how is this syndicate or what we
[03:12:34.460 --> 03:12:38.540]  call in our book the biopharmaceutical complex organized i can tell you how to organize they
[03:12:38.540 --> 03:12:45.980]  go meet in davos switzerland they meet and every single person who's uh there in davos switzerland
[03:12:45.980 --> 03:12:52.700]  i think should be uh investigated and deposed in their participation of this crime this crime against
[03:12:52.700 --> 03:13:01.020]  humanity we got three minutes left other key points major key points are that uh uh uh natural
[03:13:01.020 --> 03:13:07.340]  immunity appears to be winning the day the first question i ask when someone calls me and says dr
[03:13:07.340 --> 03:13:12.460]  mccall i have covid the first question i have is did you have it before and if you've had it before
[03:13:12.460 --> 03:13:16.700]  what we've learned now is very few people need prescription drugs we can use over the counter
[03:13:16.700 --> 03:13:22.140]  nutraceuticals and supplements virus idol nasal washes and sprays and gargles and we can get through
[03:13:22.140 --> 03:13:27.820]  it with no prescription drugs and no worry about hospitalization and death if someone
[03:13:28.380 --> 03:13:33.500]  is having their first episode of covid different story they probably will need full macula protocol
[03:13:33.500 --> 03:13:39.020]  flcc or aflbs one of the standard outpatient protocols and don't wait if it's your first
[03:13:39.020 --> 03:13:43.900]  case of covid don't wait contact either your doctor if they know how to treat covid or move
[03:13:43.900 --> 03:13:48.140]  to one of the treatment network's wellness company uh being accessible to all but there's
[03:13:48.140 --> 03:13:52.860]  many wonderful telemedicine companies in fact myfreedoctor.com is now associated with the
[03:13:52.860 --> 03:13:58.700]  wellness company wonderful move by ben marble great god foster culcin to do this but make sure
[03:13:58.700 --> 03:14:04.460]  you let the doctor know is it your first episode or a subsequent episode very very important the
[03:14:04.460 --> 03:14:11.660]  other point Alex is this came out from a recent harvard study by clausen and colleagues concluding
[03:14:11.660 --> 03:14:17.180]  94 percent of americans have been through covid listen there is no emergency this is over with
[03:14:17.180 --> 03:14:22.140]  wars and the reason we harp on it is it's their excuse for world government their excuse for
[03:14:22.140 --> 03:14:27.740]  universal basic income their excuse for the carbon tax their excuse for the the social credit score
[03:14:27.740 --> 03:14:31.820]  it's their big power grab that's why we've got to keep exposing it they're going to launch again
[03:14:31.820 --> 03:14:35.420]  it's a lot of my listeners go look we made it through it screw them what's going on no they're
[03:14:35.420 --> 03:14:41.180]  coming back again well as evidence for that what did biden just do he extended the national emergency
[03:14:41.180 --> 03:14:46.140]  remember there's two and his new chief of staff was the former coveted that's true and you know that
[03:14:46.140 --> 03:14:50.940]  the national emergencies there's two of them there's one declared by the president a national
[03:14:50.940 --> 03:14:58.460]  emergency and then by secretary of hhs the health emergency those need to fall people should put a
[03:14:58.460 --> 03:15:03.980]  tremendous amount of pressure on this do you know there's a recent letter that's gone from 25 governors
[03:15:04.620 --> 03:15:11.980]  25 governors to call for the um dissolution of those two national emergencies
[03:15:11.980 --> 03:15:18.700]  in many states now are getting rid of any emergency declaration that's right so america and the world

[03:20:30.700 --> 03:20:35.660]  right there i'm your guest host maria z guest hosting the fourth hour of the alex jones show
[03:20:35.660 --> 03:20:41.020]  today we're about to have a special guest on simian boykov the osi kozak from australia who's
[03:20:41.020 --> 03:20:46.780]  under immense pressure and attack by the australian government the australian media for telling the
[03:20:46.780 --> 03:20:53.900]  truth about the russia ukraine situation uh and exposing our tyrannical government here in australia
[03:20:53.900 --> 03:20:58.460]  before he comes on the screen i want to show everyone a quick clip that he released recently
[03:20:58.460 --> 03:21:03.820]  uh the team will get that ready for us in a moment he was one of the first well actually he was the
[03:21:03.820 --> 03:21:09.340]  first in australia to expose that our own doherty institute who were responsible for all of the
[03:21:09.340 --> 03:21:17.020]  modeling when it came to covet 19 injections were harvesting or at least invoicing the blood
[03:21:17.020 --> 03:21:23.820]  samples from the ukraine biolabs no one else in the world exposed this information before simian
[03:21:23.820 --> 03:21:28.300]  and now he's found more bombshell information he's going to talk to us about that right now but
[03:21:28.300 --> 03:21:33.980]  i want to show you the start of this quick video before we bring him on if you've been watching
[03:21:33.980 --> 03:21:38.620]  this channel for a long time for the last two years you would have remembered that last year in
[03:21:38.620 --> 03:21:45.020]  march 2022 just at the beginning of the uh conflict with the special operation i made a video where
[03:21:45.020 --> 03:21:49.500]  we unheard some documents we revealed some documents that were seized by the russian military in one
[03:21:49.500 --> 03:21:54.700]  of these uh bio weapons labs facilities now the paper trail which we're going to reveal reveal
[03:21:54.700 --> 03:21:59.580]  he today leads actually back to australia so we've got documents which the russian military
[03:21:59.580 --> 03:22:03.900]  have actually released that i've captured these documents through the course of their campaign
[03:22:03.900 --> 03:22:08.060]  and they've released these documents now the first document on screen check it out this is a document
[03:22:08.060 --> 03:22:15.340]  that's uh addressed to the victorian infectious reference laboratory the doherty institute
[03:22:15.340 --> 03:22:20.460]  and it's coming from a ukrainian organization uh which is very interesting because it's uh
[03:22:20.460 --> 03:22:26.940]  uh linked to the ukrainian government and it's linked to these biolabs which are funded by nato
[03:22:27.900 --> 03:22:34.140]  it was basically exposing the australian melbourne based doherty institutes links to
[03:22:34.140 --> 03:22:39.500]  the ukrainian biolabs which were run by the united states today we've got an excellent video that's
[03:22:39.500 --> 03:22:46.860]  come all the way from one of the uh towns robiers needs called which has been uh liberated by the
[03:22:46.860 --> 03:22:53.820]  russian military absolutely bombshell information when this first came out and immediately the
[03:22:53.820 --> 03:22:58.700]  mainstream media started to attack simian i wonder why they don't want you to know the truth about
[03:22:58.700 --> 03:23:03.900]  ukraine they don't want you to know where millions billions of your tax dollars are going and what
[03:23:03.900 --> 03:23:08.940]  they're actually going to fund and now we have even more information which simian has exposed
[03:23:08.940 --> 03:23:13.420]  he joins us today to talk about all of this simian boykov the osikozak great to see you
[03:23:13.420 --> 03:23:21.100]  you great to see you maria thank you it's wonderful to have you here well first and foremost i want
[03:23:21.100 --> 03:23:27.340]  to i've sent the team some clips from this 14 minute interview uh sorry video that you've
[03:23:27.340 --> 03:23:31.900]  brought forward from ukraine i've asked them if they can play those on mute while we while we're
[03:23:31.900 --> 03:23:37.740]  talking uh because we want to we want to talk about what's actually been discovered in these
[03:23:37.740 --> 03:23:44.540]  ukraine biolabs overseas these are human experiments these are uh you know they're they're they're
[03:23:44.540 --> 03:23:51.100]  treating these people like guinea pigs and they are developing ethnic bio weapons what's been
[03:23:51.100 --> 03:23:56.460]  found here specifically the slavic people but you take the floor simian you talk about how you
[03:23:56.460 --> 03:24:00.300]  want to introduce this and the team will just bring these up on the screen as we're going
[03:24:00.300 --> 03:24:07.660]  well look this is one of the key reasons the one of the objectives which the russian military
[03:24:08.460 --> 03:24:14.220]  very early on stated uh obviously they said that they're conducting their special operation
[03:24:14.220 --> 03:24:21.100]  to demilitarize and denazify ukraine but also they uh made reference to these biolab weapons
[03:24:21.100 --> 03:24:27.900]  labs and and these biolab weapons labs uh were all around ukraine different areas and the reason why
[03:24:27.900 --> 03:24:35.500]  the united states nato opened these biolabs uh biolabs in ukraine is because everything in
[03:24:35.500 --> 03:24:41.900]  ukraine is for sale including humans including organs uh and what better place to test on local
[03:24:41.900 --> 03:24:47.580]  population uh you know the vaccines and this is not exactly what they were doing they were testing
[03:24:47.580 --> 03:24:53.660]  the vaccines and locals in this video are describing how uh you know they were offered very small
[03:24:53.660 --> 03:24:58.860]  amounts of money and to take part in all these human trials and human trials which really
[03:24:58.860 --> 03:25:06.060]  weren't even supposed to be fit for animals and a big shout out and well done to those people that
[03:25:06.940 --> 03:25:12.860]  made it into the biolabs and this video was translated by a girl called marsha and their
[03:25:12.860 --> 03:25:17.260]  team so well done to them for bringing this to light you know i was scheduled to fly over to
[03:25:17.260 --> 03:25:22.380]  russia until the Australian government confiscated my passport you know as you mentioned i have been
[03:25:22.380 --> 03:25:29.180]  under a lot of uh you know pressure from the government and and the police uh for uh you know
[03:25:29.180 --> 03:25:35.500]  my work uh on exposing these situations but the dowry institute which is linked to the
[03:25:35.500 --> 03:25:41.260]  ukrainian biolabs we have a direct link and that link was made early on through a paper trail uh
[03:25:41.260 --> 03:25:46.700]  you know they have a lot to answer for and don't forget dowry institute this is victorian infectious
[03:25:46.700 --> 03:25:53.740]  diseases uh institute was the organization which was running australia well you know we were under
[03:25:53.740 --> 03:26:00.140]  their control and influence our politicians in australia were taking orders from the dowry institute
[03:26:01.180 --> 03:26:06.620]  and that's how uh you know everything in this country was being run on the advice of the dowry
[03:26:06.620 --> 03:26:12.700]  institute so very mysterious we know that they were importing blood serum samples and that's
[03:26:12.700 --> 03:26:17.660]  been proven and they've never commented on it i mean we've exposed this you know and everyone
[03:26:18.300 --> 03:26:21.660]  knows about this but the dowry institute have never actually faced the music
[03:26:22.300 --> 03:26:28.060]  and come clean and said well yes or well no you know we know that they've been doing that we know
[03:26:28.060 --> 03:26:34.300]  that they have been importing blood serum samples from these experimental bio weapons labs in ukraine
[03:26:34.300 --> 03:26:37.580]  which have now been overrun and captured by the russian military but it'd be great if the dowry
[03:26:37.580 --> 03:26:42.860]  institute could come out you know uh you know someone should go to jail it should be either me
[03:26:42.860 --> 03:26:47.340]  for you know not telling the truth or it should be them for doing this so if they want to come out
[03:26:47.340 --> 03:26:52.300]  absolutely let's just discuss let's just discuss the importance of this because people may think
[03:26:52.300 --> 03:26:56.940]  oh well it's it's australia you know why why is this relevant to us if you're watching from overseas
[03:26:56.940 --> 03:27:03.020]  it's relevant because the global pandemic center will be run out of australia all these blood serum
[03:27:03.020 --> 03:27:08.300]  samples that the dowry institute was collecting from slavic people and this is this is what was
[03:27:08.300 --> 03:27:13.500]  on the video for the radio viewers they can't see what we were just playing but essentially the
[03:27:13.500 --> 03:27:20.220]  they were at one of these ukraine bio labs they were talking about how all kinds of blood samples
[03:27:20.220 --> 03:27:25.420]  were found different medicines and pills that were not even safe for animal use were being
[03:27:25.420 --> 03:27:31.900]  experimented on uh people they were being offered as as simian said very little amounts of money
[03:27:31.900 --> 03:27:39.180]  to have experimentation done and what it resulted in was a huge coronavirus outbreak
[03:27:39.180 --> 03:27:45.580]  after they were given these medications so after they were given these vaccines so like we see now
[03:27:45.580 --> 03:27:54.620]  the injected population this huge overwhelming outbreak of uh covid cases hospitalizations
[03:27:54.620 --> 03:28:00.700]  of whatever is wrong with these people who are quadruple injected you know the new south
[03:28:00.700 --> 03:28:08.860]  wales data came out most cases in hospital 198 i think if i'm not mistaken with four doses zero
[03:28:08.860 --> 03:28:14.300]  unvaccinated cases this is what happened in ukraine they tested it on these people first

[03:33:22.380 --> 03:33:28.380]  about it's about testing on these people treating them as lab rats so that they can develop bio weapons
[03:33:28.380 --> 03:33:33.260]  that are ethnic specific it's unbelievable news and simian's been right at the forefront of this
[03:33:33.260 --> 03:33:35.660]  simian please continue what you were saying right before the break
[03:33:37.660 --> 03:33:41.660]  oh look it's it's great to say that a lot of people are awake a lot of people are waking up
[03:33:41.660 --> 03:33:49.100]  because it's very easy to expose you know the globalists that were pushing things all together
[03:33:49.100 --> 03:33:54.780]  they're pushing the climate agenda they're pushing the ukraine agenda that's why it's important for
[03:33:54.780 --> 03:33:59.260]  all of us out there the free world to stand with russia very important for the free world to stand
[03:33:59.260 --> 03:34:04.060]  with russia because russia really is you know the last bastion it's the last bastion to last
[03:34:04.060 --> 03:34:10.220]  stronghold it's the you know last government which doesn't fall into the you know international
[03:34:10.220 --> 03:34:15.820]  banking system it doesn't be out to the ross trials or doesn't be out to you know the claus
[03:34:15.820 --> 03:34:20.860]  schwaub and wef and that's why the west that's why they can't stand let me put in you know and he
[03:34:20.860 --> 03:34:25.900]  does the best for his country but he's also doing a very important mission for the rest of the free
[03:34:25.900 --> 03:34:31.740]  world just imagine a world without russia that means that nato the ceo a the obamas the clinton
[03:34:31.740 --> 03:34:36.540]  the bitons they'll be completely in control so it's very good to have a country like russia
[03:34:36.540 --> 03:34:43.100]  which is powerful which is pushing forward in its interests and in a way and what's happening now and
[03:34:43.100 --> 03:34:46.540]  the way the russians are conducting their war they're really fighting for the whole world they're
[03:34:46.540 --> 03:34:52.300]  fighting for everybody's freedom just take if that if they manage to take down russia you know
[03:34:52.300 --> 03:34:55.980]  if the world will be a completely different place i mean the world already is a dangerous place it's
[03:34:55.980 --> 03:35:01.980]  a scary place and we know that the globalists are in charge build gates is in in australia at the
[03:35:01.980 --> 03:35:07.340]  moment there's a rumor that tomorrow he'll be on the weekend in australia he'll be at the tennis
[03:35:07.340 --> 03:35:13.180]  and there's another you know the organization which needs calling out tennis australia they've
[03:35:13.180 --> 03:35:19.020]  banned russian flags they've banned anything to do with russia now they've even banned russian imperial
[03:35:19.020 --> 03:35:24.940]  flags so there's this paranoia and this anti russian hysteria which has been spun by the same
[03:35:25.500 --> 03:35:31.820]  people the same organizations the same tactics which they used to push the vaccines on everybody
[03:35:31.820 --> 03:35:36.700]  and to push the lockdowns on everybody it's the same team you know they've you know what i find
[03:35:36.700 --> 03:35:43.420]  disgusting regardless regardless of what people's views are on putin on russia on ukraine regardless
[03:35:43.420 --> 03:35:50.220]  of what you have used are the way that the russian people have been demonized for something that really
[03:35:50.220 --> 03:35:55.580]  isn't their decision or they have nothing to do with is disgusting i mean i i i was told by a serbian
[03:35:55.580 --> 03:36:03.260]  journalist who i interviewed sasha borievic he said on the sign on shop signs in europe it says no
[03:36:03.260 --> 03:36:09.420]  russian pigs allowed it is disgusting treatment of the russian people so regardless of what your
[03:36:09.420 --> 03:36:14.700]  thoughts are you're right it is the same tactic that was used against the unvaccinated
[03:36:17.660 --> 03:36:23.820]  exactly right exactly right and look at the end of the day russians are built for this and russia
[03:36:23.820 --> 03:36:28.540]  is built for this it's not the first time russia has had to fight for humanity's freedom it's not
[03:36:28.540 --> 03:36:35.260]  the first time where russia is fighting a joint coalition of you know dozens of countries you
[03:36:35.260 --> 03:36:42.540]  know it is sad that a lot of people are dying and you know the ukrainians have been fooled by
[03:36:43.740 --> 03:36:49.740]  you know the by the cna by nato we know that the bitons and abomas fingerprints were all over
[03:36:49.740 --> 03:36:56.620]  ukraine and they were there from 2014 and they've managed to create a situation where the slavic
[03:36:57.740 --> 03:37:04.780]  guinefont or the genetic pool of the slabs is under attack once more and you know these biolabs
[03:37:04.780 --> 03:37:10.540]  these experiments were taking place um exactly there you know on russia's borders russia have
[03:37:10.540 --> 03:37:16.060]  ever right to come in with its military and to liberate these cities and towns you know in those
[03:37:16.060 --> 03:37:22.860]  cities and towns sorry simian i want to talk more if the team can get that that video up of
[03:37:22.860 --> 03:37:29.020]  computers being destroyed it's video five while you're talking because they they want this evidence
[03:37:29.020 --> 03:37:33.980]  completely destroyed they don't want the world to know that this is what was discovered by the
[03:37:33.980 --> 03:37:42.140]  russians in ukraine well this is a call out to the russian government and to the people in charge
[03:37:42.140 --> 03:37:48.540]  in the russian military i suggest that they try to capture and also release as much information as
[03:37:48.540 --> 03:37:55.980]  possible about the biolabs about the experimental vaccines and so forth because it'll greatly benefit
[03:37:56.780 --> 03:38:01.500]  russia a lot of people have already realized that russia is on the right side of history
[03:38:01.500 --> 03:38:07.020]  and by people supporting russia they themselves are on the right side of history and thankfully
[03:38:07.020 --> 03:38:11.580]  you know thankfully the russians are honorable they are the good guys we can say that the way
[03:38:11.580 --> 03:38:15.980]  within which way they conduct uh you know their military operation they're very honorable you
[03:38:15.980 --> 03:38:20.860]  know they they don't use the carpet bombing tactics that the americans did you know in iraq
[03:38:20.860 --> 03:38:26.060]  afghanistan everywhere else they're very careful they try to preserve as much life as possible
[03:38:26.060 --> 03:38:30.620]  at the end of the day i've said it before you know it maybe sounds shocking but for those people
[03:38:30.620 --> 03:38:36.540]  who understand history i'll you know i'll say it again the only country in the world that will
[03:38:36.540 --> 03:38:42.060]  ever help ukraine is russia every other country the germans the british the americans they're just
[03:38:42.060 --> 03:38:47.180]  they're just there to use the ukrainians you know and it's very sad that the ukrainians are dying
[03:38:47.180 --> 03:38:53.340]  it's a tragedy and you know the faster the russia completes its goals and objectives the better
[03:38:53.340 --> 03:38:58.860]  we've got uh countries around the world debating whether they should send tanks in or not you know
[03:38:58.860 --> 03:39:05.180]  since when does germany have any right to talk about sending tanks against russia you know only
[03:39:05.180 --> 03:39:13.580]  30 years ago it up until 1989 uh the soviet union had two million men stationed in eastern europe
[03:39:13.580 --> 03:39:18.460]  and eastern germany was occupied and look where we are now we've got the german chancellor discussing
[03:39:18.460 --> 03:39:24.540]  whether or not he should send tanks you know leper tanks with the same german crosses the same
[03:39:24.540 --> 03:39:29.740]  uh insignia the german army is using the other they used to use in world war two so how do you
[03:39:29.740 --> 03:39:35.260]  think the russians feel when they've got you know all these western weaponry up against them and the
[03:39:35.260 --> 03:39:39.420]  only thing ukrainian about the ukrainian army is the meat and the flesh and the blood and it's
[03:39:39.420 --> 03:39:44.380]  another thing that we should talk about on this program today is the shocking amount of organ
[03:39:44.380 --> 03:39:50.700]  harvesting and organ trafficking which is occurring uh you know these ukrainian front lines often they
[03:39:50.700 --> 03:39:57.500]  understaffed they're undersupplied but when it comes to evacuating uh freshly dead bodies or it
[03:39:57.500 --> 03:40:03.980]  comes to evacuating uh almost dead soldiers or near-death soldiers or heavily injured soldiers
[03:40:04.700 --> 03:40:10.300]  they have special vans special ambulances ambulances which are all provided uh by the west
[03:40:10.300 --> 03:40:16.220]  in the form of a donation and what happens is they're extracted by special teams and these special
[03:40:16.220 --> 03:40:24.860]  teams extract the ukrainian bodies and the organ harvesting waiting lists all around europe have
[03:40:24.860 --> 03:40:29.500]  now uh almost disappeared it's the best time ever if you want to get a kidney if you want to get a
[03:40:29.500 --> 03:40:38.700]  liver very sad and we've got even in the ukrainian capital kiev mass protests thousands of mothers
[03:40:38.700 --> 03:40:44.860]  ukrainian mothers and wives family members coming out of protesting demanding the ukrainian government
[03:40:44.860 --> 03:40:49.740]  a hand over the bodies or at least tell them where the bodies are because the vast majority of
[03:40:49.740 --> 03:40:55.420]  ukrainian troops are listed as missing so they're not dead they're not alive they're just missing
[03:40:55.420 --> 03:41:02.380]  and of course by listing the troops as missing there's a lensky regime avoids paying any type
[03:41:02.380 --> 03:41:08.780]  of compensation avoid admitting that the ukrainian soldiers are dead it's very sad that this is
[03:41:08.780 --> 03:41:13.900]  happening and yes they're pretending to care about the ukrainian people the governments are pretending
[03:41:13.900 --> 03:41:19.260]  that they care about saving democracy and saving ukraine i had a clip up but but i don't think we
[03:41:19.260 --> 03:41:24.460]  will have time for a true dose finance minister somehow talking about oh our country understands
[03:41:24.460 --> 03:41:31.180]  the need for democracy uh you you call democracy trampling on your own people with horses you call
[03:41:31.180 --> 03:41:38.620]  democracy locking people up in your in in police vans what they were doing was pulling protesters
[03:41:38.620 --> 03:41:43.820]  out of the freezing cold weather peaceful protesters during the trucker protests putting them in boiling
[03:41:43.820 --> 03:41:48.460]  hot police vans cooking these people but our people understand democracy and they need to
[03:41:48.460 --> 03:41:53.500]  fight in ukraine it's absolute gaslighting it's nonsense if the team can just just play that
[03:41:53.500 --> 03:41:58.940]  ethnic bio weapon clip seven while we're finishing up this segment we've got about a minute left
[03:41:58.940 --> 03:42:04.220]  this is actually what what what this evidence shows and what we're going to do is upload this full
[03:42:04.220 --> 03:42:10.940]  video along with some some clips from this segment on to the zmedia uh tab on info wars
[03:42:10.940 --> 03:42:16.860]  on band dog video right after this later on today so that everyone can see the full 14 minute video
[03:42:16.860 --> 03:42:24.380]  it's absolutely astounding they uh they were collecting this blood to develop ethnic bio
[03:42:24.380 --> 03:42:29.580]  weapons we're going to talk about simian's uh simi the attack on simian and everything that he's
[03:42:29.580 --> 03:42:35.100]  been through right on the other side of the break but simian 20 seconds left what do we think they'll
[03:42:35.100 --> 03:42:42.780]  do with this information with this bio weapon ethnic cleansing well before we get to what they'll
[03:42:42.780 --> 03:42:47.020]  do with the information this information is very dangerous it is very hot and this is
[03:42:47.020 --> 03:42:51.500]  it's this type of information it's this type of you know reveals let's continue on the other side
[03:42:51.500 --> 03:42:55.180]  of the break let's continue on the other side of the break we'll be right back stay with us this is

[03:47:16.940 --> 03:47:21.580]  you think the world is going to do with this information that they've tried to destroy
[03:47:21.580 --> 03:47:27.580]  from the video we just showed on screen the the ethnic bio weapons that they're going to
[03:47:27.580 --> 03:47:34.700]  be able to develop from these ukraine biolabs well it's important you know the world takes action
[03:47:34.700 --> 03:47:42.220]  obviously uh this type of information is heavily censored and you know the global giants the tech
[03:47:42.220 --> 03:47:48.620]  giants facebook youtube they try to censor this as much as possible now this video uh from inside a
[03:47:48.620 --> 03:47:53.660]  bioweapons lab which was captured by the russian military uh i'm going to give a shout out here
[03:47:53.660 --> 03:48:00.380]  to iall great tv and um uh john mark duggan and there's a quite a few english-speaking journalists
[03:48:00.380 --> 03:48:05.580]  who are in that part of the world in the conflict zone like patrick landcaster like
[03:48:05.580 --> 03:48:11.900]  graham phillips and they're doing they're doing great work to expose you know the lies of the
[03:48:11.900 --> 03:48:18.220]  western media in relation to the conflict between russia and nato and i don't call it a ukraine
[03:48:18.220 --> 03:48:22.780]  russia conflict because russia has nothing to fight ukraine over it's really a russia-naked
[03:48:22.780 --> 03:48:29.020]  conflict which ukraine is a proxy which is ukraine is being used as cannon fodder and the
[03:48:29.020 --> 03:48:32.940]  ukrainians are being armed to the teeth and the ukrainians have been giving weapons and it's very
[03:48:32.940 --> 03:48:40.540]  sad to see how ukraine is uh losing uh so many people losing everything uh just to appease the
[03:48:40.540 --> 03:48:47.420]  western military industrial complex now this video that's uh come out and shows and proves
[03:48:47.420 --> 03:48:52.060]  exactly what we've been talking about for the last you know two years and we've been talking
[03:48:52.060 --> 03:48:56.300]  about these biolabs a lot of people have been talking about the biolabs the russians said
[03:48:56.300 --> 03:49:00.860]  from day one that that's one of their objective objectives that's one of the reasons they started
[03:49:00.860 --> 03:49:08.300]  these special military operations is to take these bioweapons labs out of commission and of course
[03:49:08.300 --> 03:49:13.180]  the reason why the americans open them in ukraine is in ukraine there are no laws you know it would
[03:49:13.180 --> 03:49:19.980]  be illegal to open these and operate these biolabs on the territory of america or canada or western
[03:49:19.980 --> 03:49:24.940]  europe so they use ukraine because you know ukraine is a very very corrupt country everything's for
[03:49:24.940 --> 03:49:31.980]  sale everything can be sold or bought children organs you know livers kidneys and it's very it's
[03:49:31.980 --> 03:49:39.020]  very sad that the virtue signaling politicians of the west have all got their fingers in that pie
[03:49:39.020 --> 03:49:44.780]  they're all mixed up in there it's just like a cesspool of corruption and at the end of the day
[03:49:44.780 --> 03:49:49.660]  there's a tragedy that the ukrainian people are suffering and so look it's very important for
[03:49:49.660 --> 03:49:55.500]  everybody out there to continue fighting to continue you know on social media wherever you can educating
[03:49:55.500 --> 03:50:02.140]  others educating uh you know the sheep who have been blinded and who follow the mainstream media
[03:50:02.140 --> 03:50:08.460]  narrative it's very similar in fact it's almost the same story the same storyline as we had with
[03:50:08.460 --> 03:50:13.660]  the vaccines and with covid we had a portion of the population who was awake and they started
[03:50:13.660 --> 03:50:18.860]  educating the rest and now we have most of the people on the planet have understood that the
[03:50:18.860 --> 03:50:23.500]  vaccines were a bad idea that apart from the fact that people are dropping like flies and dying
[03:50:24.060 --> 03:50:29.260]  very sad again but it's the same culprits the same people that were behind the same global
[03:50:29.260 --> 03:50:34.380]  and you know what simian and you know what as dr peter mccullough was just saying in studio with
[03:50:34.380 --> 03:50:41.900]  alex people people start to wake up because the truth is so powerful the truth is the kryptonite
[03:50:41.900 --> 03:50:47.820]  the truth is what will destroy their narrative and i don't think the globalists were expecting
[03:50:47.820 --> 03:50:52.940]  people to fight this hard and this is why this fight is so invigorating and this is why we have to
[03:50:52.940 --> 03:50:58.380]  keep going at the same pace and and with the same strength that we did from day one because
[03:50:58.380 --> 03:51:03.660]  we won't give up that we can't give up on the truth you've been under a lot of fire for not
[03:51:03.660 --> 03:51:07.500]  giving up on the truth particularly because what you're saying right now is something that a lot
[03:51:07.500 --> 03:51:12.140]  of people don't want to hear talk to us in the next couple of minutes about as much as you can
[03:51:12.140 --> 03:51:16.620]  say about what your situation is the attack that you're under from the police and the government
[03:51:16.620 --> 03:51:23.740]  right now well look i've been out on the on the radar of the police and the Australian government
[03:51:23.740 --> 03:51:30.540]  for a while now since the lockdowns and the forced you know mandates started in Australia
[03:51:30.540 --> 03:51:35.660]  and yeah all of those police interactions and campaigns against me were documented on
[03:51:36.220 --> 03:51:40.140]  my youtube channel Ozzy Cossack and people have seen that journey of what it's become but in
[03:51:40.140 --> 03:51:48.540]  recent times you know last year 2022 did almost half a year in jail in an Australian maximum
[03:51:48.540 --> 03:51:53.900]  security prison as a national security interest inmate and the reason why i was given that
[03:51:53.900 --> 03:51:59.980]  classification is because of my platform it's because the authorities you know basically told
[03:51:59.980 --> 03:52:05.180]  me that they're afraid of my voice and and they accuse me of being able to radicalise people
[03:52:05.180 --> 03:52:10.620]  and i'm not radicalising anyone the authorities um when they see someone with a large platform
[03:52:10.620 --> 03:52:16.140]  and a voice you know speaking the truth educating the masses they see that as a very big threat
[03:52:16.140 --> 03:52:21.580]  they see that as a threat and look at the end of the day we need to continue to put the pressure
[03:52:21.580 --> 03:52:25.420]  and put the blame on the mainstream media journalists because they are the ones that
[03:52:25.420 --> 03:52:30.860]  allowed this all to happen they continue supporting the government narrative and they
[03:52:31.420 --> 03:52:36.780]  they're the ones who have sold themselves out and are also selling out the people so that's why
[03:52:36.780 --> 03:52:44.140]  the Australian police the government have you know had this campaign against me i've been charged
[03:52:44.140 --> 03:52:50.380]  about you know 35 to 40 times by the police in the last few years you know firearms prohibition
[03:52:50.380 --> 03:52:55.820]  orders all sorts of different restrictions and at the moment you know the police are trying to
[03:52:55.820 --> 03:53:03.820]  put me back in the jail so i conveniently checked myself into the russian consulate in
[03:53:03.820 --> 03:53:09.580]  sydney in a move which the police did not expect at all and you know the russians welcome me with
[03:53:09.580 --> 03:53:15.580]  open arms you know the the russians uh unlike the australians who don't support us the russians
[03:53:15.580 --> 03:53:20.540]  actually look after their own and it's it's good to see that the russians look after their own so
[03:53:20.540 --> 03:53:26.300]  you know i've applied for russian citizenship and you know it's it's strange 2022 you've got people
[03:53:26.300 --> 03:53:32.140]  born in australia who are seeking refuge with the russian government you know because russia
[03:53:32.940 --> 03:53:39.020]  being uh independent from the west russia is a country which doesn't give up its own it looks
[03:53:39.020 --> 03:53:44.460]  after its own people and its own interests and um you know i know a lot of people watching this
[03:53:44.460 --> 03:53:48.460]  program are awake and they understand that the russians are not the bad guys the russians are
[03:53:48.460 --> 03:53:53.900]  the good guys in this whole situation and it's a matter of time before uh you know those virtue
[03:53:53.900 --> 03:54:00.380]  signaling people that used to wear you know two masks and four four jabs now they've you know become
[03:54:00.380 --> 03:54:05.180]  ukraine supporters it's a matter of time before they realize you know look it must be demoralizing
[03:54:05.180 --> 03:54:11.020]  being uh you know on their side being someone who promoted vaccines realized they are wrong
[03:54:11.020 --> 03:54:14.780]  then someone who promoted ukraine then realized they are wrong you know what's next they're
[03:54:14.780 --> 03:54:19.980]  promoting climate and the same the same people the same narrative the same tactics the same
[03:54:19.980 --> 03:54:27.420]  presenters the same stories the same platforms you know the wef and so forth so at the end of the day
[03:54:27.420 --> 03:54:31.580]  you know all i can say is you raise a good point there's you raise a good point there simian about
[03:54:31.580 --> 03:54:36.940]  it must be demoralizing to wake up i recall doing an interview with dr mike eden and i spoke about
[03:54:36.940 --> 03:54:43.340]  this a long time ago and in that interview dr eden described when he woke up and he said
[03:54:43.340 --> 03:54:48.540]  after three days of struggling to be able to sleep he finally in the middle of the night
[03:54:48.540 --> 03:54:53.820]  dropped to his knees and just burst out in tears he was very emotional in this interview uh and he
[03:54:53.820 --> 03:54:59.260]  said it was it was so challenging so so difficult to come to terms with the fact that there are
[03:54:59.260 --> 03:55:03.580]  people out there that want us dead and i was wrong and i used to think that people that thought this
[03:55:03.580 --> 03:55:09.740]  way were wackos it is very hard for people to come to terms with that i am seeing pro vax accounts on
[03:55:09.740 --> 03:55:15.260]  social media coming out and saying i was wrong i was terribly wrong i'm sorry for the way i
[03:55:15.260 --> 03:55:20.380]  treated people more and more people are starting to realize elon musk tweets about the fact that
[03:55:20.380 --> 03:55:26.300]  he's had an injection injury following his second injection the news goes viral worldwide people are
[03:55:26.300 --> 03:55:32.780]  starting to see this and and there is um more and more being spoken about my only concern
[03:55:32.780 --> 03:55:38.460]  and and this is probably relevant because you're on is that the we have told us over the next two
[03:55:38.460 --> 03:55:43.660]  years we can expect a catastrophic cyber attacks all over the world and i think they're probably
[03:55:43.660 --> 03:55:50.860]  going to blame a lot of that on russia and a lot of pro ukraine you know ukraine in bio uh people
[03:55:50.860 --> 03:55:58.540]  are going to go along with that yeah well it's the uh unfortunately they're just sheep and i'll
[03:55:58.540 --> 03:56:03.180]  you know sheep uh what we call them sheep because they're hurt together firstly secondly they're
[03:56:03.180 --> 03:56:10.220]  scared they're always scared and these people uh for them because they were scared a lot of people
[03:56:10.220 --> 03:56:15.980]  that went along with the the vaccine narrative and the covered narrative because to believe in the
[03:56:15.980 --> 03:56:21.500]  alternative narrative to believe in the concept that no the government is corrupt no the government
[03:56:21.500 --> 03:56:26.620]  is attacking its own people no the government is wrong to believe that you know that takes courage
[03:56:26.620 --> 03:56:32.460]  that takes courage to face reality and a lot of people just like to you know like the sheep do
[03:56:32.460 --> 03:56:37.580]  just being a herd and go along with whatever's happening because they they're afraid of facing
[03:56:37.580 --> 03:56:43.340]  reality just like you mentioned where you know that um expert uh you know had a breakdown after
[03:56:43.340 --> 03:56:47.740]  all these years of promoting the vaccine he fell to his knees crying a lot of people are facing that
[03:56:47.740 --> 03:56:53.180]  and a lot of people are having to you know face the music and admit they were wrong and uh you
[03:56:53.180 --> 03:56:57.500]  know backtrack and delete their posts from social media and so forth yeah but what's uh
[03:56:58.380 --> 03:57:01.100]  what's interesting is if this will get to the point where there'll be a class
[03:57:02.620 --> 03:57:07.020]  we're we're almost out of time simian we're just about to run out on the clock please tell people
