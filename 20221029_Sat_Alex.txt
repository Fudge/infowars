[00:18.000 --> 00:20.000]  I'm going to bring down the new
[00:20.000 --> 00:24.000]  world order.
[00:24.000 --> 00:26.000]  Now take you live to the central
[00:26.000 --> 00:28.000]  Texas for man.
[00:28.000 --> 00:30.000]  In the heart of the resistance
[00:30.000 --> 00:34.000]  broadcasting worldwide.
[00:34.000 --> 00:38.000]  Yeah.
[00:38.000 --> 00:40.000]  We now take you live to the
[00:40.000 --> 00:42.000]  central Texas command center
[00:42.000 --> 00:44.000]  in the heart of the resistance.
[00:44.000 --> 00:47.000]  You're listening to Alex Jones.
[00:47.000 --> 01:03.000]  All right, my friends.
[01:03.000 --> 01:05.000]  Thank you so much for joining us.
[01:05.000 --> 01:07.000]  We've got one hell of a broadcast
[01:07.000 --> 01:09.000]  lined up for you.
[01:09.000 --> 01:11.000]  Roger Stone with internals of
[01:11.000 --> 01:13.000]  what trumpet to sand is her up to
[01:13.000 --> 01:15.000]  10 days out from the midterms.
[01:15.000 --> 01:18.000]  Then a major researcher on the
[01:18.000 --> 01:20.000]  new world order that I've known
[01:20.000 --> 01:22.000]  for eight years that is known in
[01:22.000 --> 01:24.000]  some of the more.
[01:24.000 --> 01:26.000]  Informed elite circles but not
[01:26.000 --> 01:27.000]  no other general public.
[01:27.000 --> 01:29.000]  Acharya G will be joining us
[01:29.000 --> 01:31.000]  coming up and then Mark Passio
[01:31.000 --> 01:33.000]  on natural law and his predictions
[01:33.000 --> 01:35.000]  for the near future and the long
[01:35.000 --> 01:36.000]  term as well.
[01:36.000 --> 01:38.000]  It is all coming up today on this
[01:38.000 --> 01:39.000]  very special.
[01:39.000 --> 01:41.000]  Saturday emergency
[01:41.000 --> 01:43.000]  transmission that will be posted
[01:43.000 --> 01:45.000]  in the band on video and then
[01:45.000 --> 01:47.000]  will also be re streamed until
[01:47.000 --> 01:49.000]  four p.m. central tomorrow with
[01:49.000 --> 01:51.000]  a regular Sunday show and I got
[01:51.000 --> 01:53.000]  to tell you that's a very
[01:53.000 --> 01:55.000]  special guest lined up tomorrow
[01:55.000 --> 01:56.000]  night and next week.
[01:56.000 --> 01:58.000]  You do not want to miss any
[01:58.000 --> 02:00.000]  addition of the Alex Jones show
[02:00.000 --> 02:02.000]  this week as if you ever want to
[02:02.000 --> 02:03.000]  miss any of them.
[02:03.000 --> 02:05.000]  The globalists work around the
[02:05.000 --> 02:07.000]  clock to make sure you get
[02:07.000 --> 02:08.000]  disconnected from those.
[02:08.000 --> 02:10.000]  Okay, but let me hit some big
[02:10.000 --> 02:11.000]  breaking news first.
[02:11.000 --> 02:13.000]  The British Navy blew up the
[02:13.000 --> 02:15.000]  Nord Stream Pipeline 2.
[02:15.000 --> 02:17.000]  Also, we have
[02:17.000 --> 02:19.000]  Nancy Pelosi's husband
[02:19.000 --> 02:21.000]  being attacked
[02:21.000 --> 02:23.000]  with a hammer and
[02:23.000 --> 02:25.000]  them trying to say that he's a
[02:25.000 --> 02:27.000]  Trump supporter or a QAnon person
[02:27.000 --> 02:29.000]  but now we have the audio we'll
[02:29.000 --> 02:30.000]  play in just a moment.
[02:30.000 --> 02:32.000]  The 911 call.
[02:32.000 --> 02:34.000]  Police dispatch.
[02:34.000 --> 02:36.000]  Paul Pelosi said he doesn't know
[02:36.000 --> 02:38.000]  who the male is but
[02:38.000 --> 02:40.000]  he advised that his name is David
[02:40.000 --> 02:42.000]  and he is a friend.
[02:42.000 --> 02:44.000]  He was in his underwear.
[02:44.000 --> 02:46.000]  They were naked.
[02:46.000 --> 02:48.000]  The stuff was broken inside not
[02:48.000 --> 02:50.000]  broken into and so
[02:50.000 --> 02:52.000]  something very
[02:52.000 --> 02:54.000]  interesting going on there
[02:54.000 --> 02:56.000]  with Mr. or Herr
[02:56.000 --> 02:58.000]  Monsieur
[02:58.000 --> 03:00.000]  Pelosi will be getting into
[03:00.000 --> 03:02.000]  all of that here
[03:02.000 --> 03:04.000]  today and of course the really
[03:04.000 --> 03:06.000]  big COVID news.
[03:06.000 --> 03:08.000]  The really big
[03:08.000 --> 03:10.000]  COVID news
[03:10.000 --> 03:12.000]  that we also have to get to
[03:12.000 --> 03:14.000]  but again in a moment we're going
[03:14.000 --> 03:16.000]  to play the 911 call
[03:16.000 --> 03:18.000]  from
[03:18.000 --> 03:20.000]  Pelosi's husband
[03:20.000 --> 03:22.000]  not the DWI call
[03:22.000 --> 03:24.000]  the 911 call
[03:24.000 --> 03:26.000]  here in just a moment and then
[03:26.000 --> 03:28.000]  after advocating for COVID-19
[03:28.000 --> 03:30.000]  vaccine for a year
[03:30.000 --> 03:32.000]  Ben Shapiro says he was deceived
[03:32.000 --> 03:34.000]  we're being lied to by everyone
[03:34.000 --> 03:36.000]  by Bill Gates
[03:36.000 --> 03:38.000]  and the New World Order. Now he knows
[03:38.000 --> 03:40.000]  everyone's turning against him. Now he's
[03:40.000 --> 03:42.000]  doubling back and we've got a lot of
[03:42.000 --> 03:44.000]  big developments on that
[03:44.000 --> 03:46.000]  front. They're also getting ready to
[03:46.000 --> 03:48.000]  steal the election if they can in 10 days.
[03:48.000 --> 03:50.000]  You're a cook, you're a terrorist,
[03:50.000 --> 03:52.000]  you're a criminal, you should be censored,
[03:52.000 --> 03:54.000]  you should be outlawed, you should be persecuted.
[03:54.000 --> 03:56.000]  You're the worst person on earth
[03:56.000 --> 03:58.000]  if you question elections.
[03:58.000 --> 04:00.000]  Though the State Department sends the U.S.
[04:00.000 --> 04:02.000]  around everywhere to check other elections
[04:02.000 --> 04:04.000]  now the Democrats are saying they believe
[04:04.000 --> 04:06.000]  the Republicans
[04:06.000 --> 04:08.000]  are going to steal the election in 10
[04:08.000 --> 04:10.000]  days and Pennsylvania
[04:10.000 --> 04:12.000]  has said waiting on Pennsylvania
[04:12.000 --> 04:14.000]  by the U.S. Senate race
[04:14.000 --> 04:16.000]  may drag past election night
[04:16.000 --> 04:18.000]  it's being reported
[04:18.000 --> 04:20.000]  by the Times
[04:20.000 --> 04:22.000]  leader and others so
[04:22.000 --> 04:24.000]  more of those special magical
[04:24.000 --> 04:26.000]  mail-in ballots but here is
[04:26.000 --> 04:28.000]  the audio of this post
[04:28.000 --> 04:30.000]  of the article on infowars.com
[04:30.000 --> 04:32.000]  police dispatch Paul Palos
[04:32.000 --> 04:34.000]  he said he doesn't know
[04:34.000 --> 04:36.000]  who the mail is but
[04:36.000 --> 04:38.000]  he advised that his name is David
[04:38.000 --> 04:40.000]  and he is a friend
[04:40.000 --> 04:42.000]  here it is
[04:42.000 --> 04:44.000]  Northern four car
[04:44.000 --> 04:46.000]  a priority 910-2640
[04:46.000 --> 04:48.000]  Broadway, Cross of Scott and Normandy
[04:48.000 --> 04:50.000]  a 14 hour copy
[04:50.000 --> 04:52.000]  R.P. stated that there's a mail in the
[04:52.000 --> 04:54.000]  home and that he's going to wait for his wife
[04:54.000 --> 04:56.000]  R.P. stated that he doesn't know who the mail is
[04:56.000 --> 04:58.000]  but he advised that his name is David
[04:58.000 --> 05:00.000]  there's a friend
[05:00.000 --> 05:02.000]  R.P. sounded somewhat confused
[05:02.000 --> 05:04.000]  there's a friend
[05:04.000 --> 05:06.000]  R.P. sounded somewhat confused
[05:06.000 --> 05:08.000]  let's go over back and get it
[05:08.000 --> 05:10.000]  alright his name is David
[05:10.000 --> 05:12.000]  and he's a friend but he doesn't know
[05:12.000 --> 05:14.000]  who he is
[05:16.000 --> 05:18.000]  well I guess the dude would look good
[05:18.000 --> 05:20.000]  if your wife
[05:20.000 --> 05:22.000]  was Nancy Pelosi that would turn
[05:22.000 --> 05:24.000]  anybody gay I would think
[05:24.000 --> 05:26.000]  but the whole point
[05:26.000 --> 05:28.000]  is they're trying to saddle
[05:28.000 --> 05:30.000]  they're trying to frame
[05:30.000 --> 05:32.000]  the American people
[05:32.000 --> 05:34.000]  with this right now
[05:34.000 --> 05:36.000]  some type of attempted false flag
[05:36.000 --> 05:38.000]  I'm not saying it didn't happen I'm saying
[05:38.000 --> 05:40.000]  they're trying to blame conservative voters
[05:40.000 --> 05:42.000]  they're calling it a new
[05:42.000 --> 05:44.000]  January 6 but it gets worse
[05:44.000 --> 05:46.000]  Senator Rand Paul who had
[05:46.000 --> 05:48.000]  six ribs broken
[05:48.000 --> 05:50.000]  and a lung punctured
[05:50.000 --> 05:52.000]  and a still and serious health problems because of it
[05:52.000 --> 05:54.000]  the left celebrated we got physically attacked
[05:54.000 --> 05:56.000]  he had a speedy recovery and saying
[05:56.000 --> 05:58.000]  political violence should not happen
[05:58.000 --> 06:00.000]  and it's wrong
[06:00.000 --> 06:02.000]  the left called him a little bitch
[06:02.000 --> 06:04.000]  went on to celebrate the attack on him
[06:04.000 --> 06:06.000]  what a group
[06:06.000 --> 06:08.000]  of
[06:08.000 --> 06:10.000]  scum that we are
[06:10.000 --> 06:12.000]  dealing with ladies and gentlemen
[06:12.000 --> 06:14.000]  now let's look at this we'll play the Shapiro
[06:14.000 --> 06:16.000]  clip here this has been Shapiro
[06:16.000 --> 06:18.000]  walks back to support for the so-called
[06:18.000 --> 06:20.000]  vaccine he now says
[06:20.000 --> 06:22.000]  well he said two shots and his wife said three shots
[06:22.000 --> 06:24.000]  and he got lied to and it's terrible
[06:24.000 --> 06:26.000]  but lied to by who
[06:26.000 --> 06:28.000]  big pharma the corporate media
[06:28.000 --> 06:30.000]  and by you saying it was safe
[06:30.000 --> 06:32.000]  and we should all take it or we're bad
[06:32.000 --> 06:34.000]  people
[06:34.000 --> 06:36.000]  here is Ben Shapiro
[06:36.000 --> 06:38.000]  we were lied to by the scientists
[06:38.000 --> 06:40.000]  we were lied to by Pfizer we were lied to by the government
[06:40.000 --> 06:42.000]  we were lied to by the Biden administration we were lied to
[06:42.000 --> 06:44.000]  I don't like being lied to I don't know about you
[06:44.000 --> 06:46.000]  and it makes me
[06:46.000 --> 06:48.000]  not believe these people
[06:48.000 --> 06:50.000]  now as I've spoken out before
[06:50.000 --> 06:52.000]  I got back twice what happened double
[06:52.000 --> 06:54.000]  that's my wife being a doctor and seeing bone
[06:54.000 --> 06:56.000]  neural patients is triple that's but
[06:56.000 --> 06:58.000]  knowing now what I know then
[06:58.000 --> 07:00.000]  what
[07:00.000 --> 07:02.000]  knowing then what I know now rather
[07:02.000 --> 07:04.000]  what I have actually gotten back
[07:04.000 --> 07:06.000]  based on the information that
[07:06.000 --> 07:08.000]  my actual chance
[07:08.000 --> 07:10.000]  of death from COVID were
[07:10.000 --> 07:12.000]  exorbitantly low and I wouldn't be preventing
[07:12.000 --> 07:14.000]  my parents from getting that was really what I was concerned about
[07:14.000 --> 07:16.000]  because we were bubbled with my parents what I've gotten it
[07:16.000 --> 07:18.000]  I don't know I really don't know
[07:18.000 --> 07:20.000]  I think maybe not
[07:20.000 --> 07:22.000]  because again my personal risk when it
[07:22.000 --> 07:24.000]  comes to the vaccine was
[07:24.000 --> 07:26.000]  extremely low when it came to COVID
[07:26.000 --> 07:28.000]  I'm a young healthy male with no
[07:28.000 --> 07:30.000]  pre-existing conditions
[07:32.000 --> 07:34.000]  yeah he's in damage control
[07:34.000 --> 07:36.000]  on his damage report
[07:36.000 --> 07:38.000]  listen Eddie monster
[07:38.000 --> 07:40.000]  the CDC's
[07:40.000 --> 07:42.000]  own document in October 2000
[07:42.000 --> 07:44.000]  said heart attacks heart swelling
[07:44.000 --> 07:46.000]  blood clots strokes
[07:46.000 --> 07:48.000]  infertility
[07:48.000 --> 07:50.000]  cancer death
[07:50.000 --> 07:52.000]  and you followed the corporate
[07:52.000 --> 07:54.000]  talking point and it's in
[07:54.000 --> 07:56.000]  spars 2025
[07:56.000 --> 07:58.000]  2028 globalist document
[07:58.000 --> 08:00.000]  that they'd hit us with two years of the poison shot
[08:00.000 --> 08:02.000]  and then admit it was wrong
[08:02.000 --> 08:04.000]  to destroy confidence in the government and the system
[08:04.000 --> 08:06.000]  but not in the UN and the big corporations
[08:06.000 --> 08:08.000]  that did it so
[08:08.000 --> 08:10.000]  Shapiro's walking it back
[08:10.000 --> 08:12.000]  but he's not telling us who's the blame
[08:12.000 --> 08:14.000]  or how it was an evil plan or how much
[08:14.000 --> 08:16.000]  money he got
[08:16.000 --> 08:18.000]  as a little monster
[08:18.000 --> 08:20.000]  to promote all this
[08:20.000 --> 08:22.000]  they'll watch our report from almost
[08:22.000 --> 08:24.000]  two years ago
[08:24.000 --> 08:26.000]  spars 2025 2028
[08:26.000 --> 08:28.000]  it's got about four million views
[08:28.000 --> 08:30.000]  banned out of video needs a
[08:30.000 --> 08:32.000]  billion views we want to save ourselves
[08:32.000 --> 08:34.000]  and you will be so blown away
[08:34.000 --> 08:36.000]  it'll make your head spin
[08:38.000 --> 08:40.000]  it even describes how people
[08:40.000 --> 08:42.000]  would find out it was poison
[08:42.000 --> 08:44.000]  they were going to spin that later
[08:44.000 --> 08:46.000]  it's beyond operation lockstep
[08:46.000 --> 08:48.000]  and the Rockefeller Foundation document
[08:48.000 --> 08:50.000]  so
[08:50.000 --> 08:52.000]  the rats are definitely leaving the sinking ship
[08:52.000 --> 08:54.000]  meanwhile this came out weeks ago
[08:54.000 --> 08:56.000]  and where's the congressional hearings
[08:56.000 --> 08:58.000]  where's the arrest
[08:58.000 --> 09:00.000]  say it for me now
[09:00.000 --> 09:02.000]  Alex Jones was right
[09:02.000 --> 09:04.000]  you see they're desperate to silence him
[09:04.000 --> 09:06.000]  Boston University creates new covid strain
[09:06.000 --> 09:08.000]  that is an 80% kill rate
[09:08.000 --> 09:10.000]  and here it is
[09:10.000 --> 09:12.000]  sailing mail even AP
[09:12.000 --> 09:14.000]  and Reuters admitted it
[09:14.000 --> 09:16.000]  but weeks later they want to
[09:16.000 --> 09:18.000]  sweep it on the rug kills 80% of humans
[09:18.000 --> 09:20.000]  it comes in contact
[09:20.000 --> 09:22.000]  with inhumanized mice
[09:22.000 --> 09:24.000]  that are part human and cloning
[09:24.000 --> 09:26.000]  have the exact same effect
[09:28.000 --> 09:30.000]  I wonder if Ben Shapiro is worried about that a little bit
[09:30.000 --> 09:32.000]  meanwhile flu they said
[09:32.000 --> 09:34.000]  was gone for two years they were counting that as covid
[09:34.000 --> 09:36.000]  you take the poison shot now so far
[09:36.000 --> 09:38.000]  the flu season is more severe than it's been
[09:38.000 --> 09:40.000]  13 years there's all these deaths of the vaccinated
[09:40.000 --> 09:42.000]  and they're calling it
[09:42.000 --> 09:44.000]  the flu
[09:44.000 --> 09:46.000]  and they've got new lock downs
[09:46.000 --> 09:48.000]  in China
[09:48.000 --> 09:50.000]  Wuhan plunged back into lock down
[09:50.000 --> 09:52.000]  almost three years after first covid case
[09:52.000 --> 09:54.000]  with 800,000 K in quarantine amid
[09:54.000 --> 09:56.000]  spike in cases
[09:56.000 --> 09:58.000]  and it goes on
[09:58.000 --> 10:00.000]  and on
[10:00.000 --> 10:02.000]  and on from there
[10:02.000 --> 10:04.000]  meanwhile we've got all these
[10:04.000 --> 10:06.000]  Debo Scroop
[10:06.000 --> 10:08.000]  CFR
[10:08.000 --> 10:10.000]  New World Ordered People like the new Prime Minister
[10:10.000 --> 10:12.000]  Rishi Sundack
[10:12.000 --> 10:14.000]  own social credit score
[10:14.000 --> 10:16.000]  he's the new British Prime Minister
[10:16.000 --> 10:18.000]  with links to World Economic Forum
[10:18.000 --> 10:20.000]  and he announces carbon taxes
[10:20.000 --> 10:22.000]  and total control and social credit scores
[10:22.000 --> 10:24.000]  and he meanwhile owns the company
[10:24.000 --> 10:26.000]  that'll be making money out of it
[10:28.000 --> 10:30.000]  it doesn't matter who you elect
[10:30.000 --> 10:32.000]  if they control all
[10:32.000 --> 10:36.000]  the major candidates
[10:36.000 --> 10:38.000]  that's their plan
[10:38.000 --> 10:40.000]  that's their operation
[10:40.000 --> 10:42.000]  remember the idiocy of the last three years
[10:42.000 --> 10:44.000]  people swimming with mask on
[10:44.000 --> 10:46.000]  people swimming with plexiglass in front of them
[10:46.000 --> 10:48.000]  all of it a sign of
[10:48.000 --> 10:50.000]  how mind controlled
[10:50.000 --> 10:52.000]  you really were
[10:52.000 --> 10:54.000]  Canada launched ID together
[10:54.000 --> 10:56.000]  with the WEF Bill Gates funding
[10:56.000 --> 10:58.000]  the initiative removes any physical passports
[10:58.000 --> 11:00.000]  that can also be used as a combined
[11:00.000 --> 11:02.000]  vaccine passport
[11:02.000 --> 11:04.000]  well fit well with the
[11:04.000 --> 11:06.000]  CBDC and its social credit score
[11:06.000 --> 11:08.000]  all for your safety of course
[11:08.000 --> 11:10.000]  all officially being
[11:10.000 --> 11:12.000]  rolled out now
[11:12.000 --> 11:14.000]  but here are the Twitter executives
[11:14.000 --> 11:16.000]  being fired
[11:16.000 --> 11:18.000]  they don't look too happy now
[11:18.000 --> 11:20.000]  and a lot of people are saying Jones
[11:20.000 --> 11:22.000]  when are you going to challenge
[11:22.000 --> 11:24.000]  Elon Musk
[11:24.000 --> 11:26.000]  and demand that you be reinstated to Twitter
[11:26.000 --> 11:28.000]  let me speak to that briefly
[11:28.000 --> 11:30.000]  before we get to these big guests
[11:30.000 --> 11:32.000]  got three of them coming up that are incredible
[11:32.000 --> 11:34.000]  I know because
[11:34.000 --> 11:36.000]  my weekday shows 11 a.m. to 3 p.m. are live
[11:36.000 --> 11:38.000]  my Sunday show 4 to 6 p.m. is live
[11:38.000 --> 11:40.000]  but the Saturday shows are usually taped
[11:40.000 --> 11:42.000]  so I'm taping
[11:42.000 --> 11:44.000]  this little news intro
[11:44.000 --> 11:46.000]  after three hours
[11:46.000 --> 11:48.000]  with Roger Stone
[11:48.000 --> 11:50.000]  with Acharya
[11:50.000 --> 11:52.000]  who'll introduce to you
[11:52.000 --> 11:54.000]  and with
[11:54.000 --> 11:56.000]  Mark Passio and this was a particularly
[11:56.000 --> 11:58.000]  powerful broadcast
[11:58.000 --> 12:00.000]  so that's all coming up here just a few minutes
[12:00.000 --> 12:02.000]  but
[12:02.000 --> 12:04.000]  let me just get back
[12:06.000 --> 12:08.000]  to the main points
[12:08.000 --> 12:10.000]  I wanted to get to here today
[12:10.000 --> 12:12.000]  the wheels are coming off
[12:12.000 --> 12:14.000]  the new world order
[12:14.000 --> 12:16.000]  the world population
[12:16.000 --> 12:18.000]  is waking up
[12:18.000 --> 12:20.000]  at record levels
[12:20.000 --> 12:22.000]  and the globalist are completely
[12:22.000 --> 12:24.000]  and totally
[12:24.000 --> 12:26.000]  absolutely
[12:26.000 --> 12:28.000]  desperate right now
[12:28.000 --> 12:30.000]  and that's why I want to encourage
[12:30.000 --> 12:32.000]  viewers to realize
[12:32.000 --> 12:34.000]  these aren't words when I say this
[12:34.000 --> 12:36.000]  how incredibly essential you are
[12:36.000 --> 12:38.000]  in this fight
[12:38.000 --> 12:40.000]  now getting back
[12:40.000 --> 12:42.000]  to Elon Musk
[12:42.000 --> 12:44.000]  I look at a tree
[12:44.000 --> 12:46.000]  by what fruits it bears
[12:46.000 --> 12:48.000]  you know I used to before
[12:48.000 --> 12:50.000]  my ex-wife divorced me
[12:50.000 --> 12:52.000]  have nine acres out in the country outside Austin
[12:52.000 --> 12:54.000]  on the Barton Creek
[12:54.000 --> 12:56.000]  and we had a couple acres on one side of the creek
[12:56.000 --> 12:58.000]  and like seven acres on the other side
[12:58.000 --> 13:00.000]  the folks we bought the house from
[13:00.000 --> 13:02.000]  had an apple
[13:02.000 --> 13:04.000]  a plum
[13:04.000 --> 13:06.000]  and a pear orchard
[13:08.000 --> 13:10.000]  and
[13:10.000 --> 13:12.000]  we could get more apples and plums
[13:12.000 --> 13:14.000]  and pears
[13:14.000 --> 13:16.000]  than we could ever eat
[13:18.000 --> 13:20.000]  off of that
[13:20.000 --> 13:22.000]  seven acres about four acres of it
[13:22.000 --> 13:24.000]  right in the middle was
[13:24.000 --> 13:26.000]  those trees
[13:26.000 --> 13:28.000]  we didn't take care of them, we didn't prune them
[13:28.000 --> 13:30.000]  but I go over there all the time
[13:30.000 --> 13:32.000]  a little spillway there at the creek
[13:32.000 --> 13:34.000]  so instead of walking through the water
[13:34.000 --> 13:36.000]  I drive my truck across
[13:36.000 --> 13:38.000]  and I just load baskets
[13:38.000 --> 13:40.000]  with
[13:40.000 --> 13:42.000]  apples and plums
[13:42.000 --> 13:44.000]  and pears
[13:44.000 --> 13:46.000]  some other fruit I'm forgetting it
[13:46.000 --> 13:51.000]  but it doesn't matter
[13:51.000 --> 13:53.000]  and the crazy thing was
[13:53.000 --> 13:55.000]  you'd have a little tree
[13:55.000 --> 13:57.000]  next to a big one
[13:57.000 --> 13:59.000]  but it would have twice as many
[13:59.000 --> 14:00.000]  plums on it
[14:00.000 --> 14:02.000]  or twice as many pears on it
[14:02.000 --> 14:03.000]  or apples
[14:03.000 --> 14:05.000]  and sometimes you'd have one of the bigger trees
[14:05.000 --> 14:07.000]  that grew really big and strong and look great
[14:07.000 --> 14:09.000]  but it would have almost nothing on it
[14:11.000 --> 14:13.000]  and that's what the Bible is talking about
[14:13.000 --> 14:15.000]  judging a tree by its fruits
[14:15.000 --> 14:17.000]  you look at this little tree
[14:17.000 --> 14:19.000]  and it's loaded with apples
[14:19.000 --> 14:21.000]  where it's almost weighed down to the ground
[14:21.000 --> 14:23.000]  in fact we had one tree that went down to the ground
[14:24.000 --> 14:26.000]  it had so many apples on it
[14:26.000 --> 14:28.000]  like a hundred apples
[14:28.000 --> 14:30.000]  and we were making apple pies
[14:30.000 --> 14:32.000]  constantly and everything just gods bounding
[14:35.000 --> 14:37.000]  and the same thing for a plum tree
[14:37.000 --> 14:39.000]  you'd have like a medium sized plum tree
[14:39.000 --> 14:40.000]  and then a big plum tree
[14:40.000 --> 14:42.000]  and there would be a few plums on the big plum tree
[14:42.000 --> 14:44.000]  and a whole bunch on the little one
[14:44.000 --> 14:46.000]  and it wasn't always like that
[14:46.000 --> 14:48.000]  we had a few trees, we probably had 50 of them
[14:48.000 --> 14:50.000]  that were big trees that were also loaded
[14:50.000 --> 14:52.000]  you had to get a ladder up there and get them off
[14:52.000 --> 14:54.000]  but that's not where I'm going with this
[14:54.000 --> 14:56.000]  people ask me
[14:56.000 --> 14:58.000]  what I think of Elon Musk
[14:58.000 --> 15:00.000]  and I try to be Christ like
[15:00.000 --> 15:02.000]  I don't claim to be very Christ like
[15:02.000 --> 15:04.000]  I try to be Christ like
[15:04.000 --> 15:06.000]  but I definitely follow the teachings of Christ
[15:06.000 --> 15:08.000]  I certainly respect Christ, he's my leader
[15:08.000 --> 15:10.000]  and my savior but let's just say this
[15:10.000 --> 15:12.000]  Christ is never wrong
[15:12.000 --> 15:14.000]  thinking to Christ that isn't from an arrogant perspective
[15:14.000 --> 15:16.000]  just be very clear
[15:16.000 --> 15:18.000]  but Christ said
[15:18.000 --> 15:20.000]  you judge a tree by its fruits
[15:20.000 --> 15:22.000]  and so when I look at Elon Musk
[15:22.000 --> 15:24.000]  and the things he's done
[15:24.000 --> 15:26.000]  promoting Neuralink
[15:26.000 --> 15:28.000]  and Starlink and all of it
[15:28.000 --> 15:30.000]  that kind of weighs down him being a good guy
[15:30.000 --> 15:32.000]  on the side of bad
[15:32.000 --> 15:34.000]  but then you look at coming out
[15:34.000 --> 15:36.000]  against the vaccine two years ago and saying
[15:36.000 --> 15:38.000]  don't take it at the start
[15:38.000 --> 15:40.000]  and coming out against world government
[15:40.000 --> 15:42.000]  and now coming out against the Ukraine war
[15:42.000 --> 15:44.000]  and now coming out against censorship
[15:44.000 --> 15:46.000]  and now saying we shouldn't get rid of fossil fuels
[15:46.000 --> 15:48.000]  they're a good thing, we need them
[15:48.000 --> 15:50.000]  alongside electric while we develop better
[15:50.000 --> 15:52.000]  systems and then we will collapse
[15:52.000 --> 15:54.000]  and we don't have it
[15:54.000 --> 15:56.000]  and just on and on and on
[15:56.000 --> 15:58.000]  I look at the tree that is Elon Musk
[15:58.000 --> 16:00.000]  and I say
[16:00.000 --> 16:02.000]  this guy's getting better and better
[16:02.000 --> 16:04.000]  and so the good side of him
[16:04.000 --> 16:06.000]  way outside the
[16:06.000 --> 16:08.000]  bad
[16:08.000 --> 16:10.000]  isn't just judging a tree by its fruits
[16:10.000 --> 16:12.000]  in my psychological, cultural,
[16:12.000 --> 16:14.000]  economic, spiritual
[16:14.000 --> 16:16.000]  lexicon
[16:16.000 --> 16:18.000]  and that is
[16:18.000 --> 16:20.000]  the trajectory
[16:20.000 --> 16:22.000]  because let's say Elon used to be somewhat bad
[16:22.000 --> 16:24.000]  we don't know
[16:24.000 --> 16:26.000]  and then he gets better and better and better and better
[16:26.000 --> 16:28.000]  and better and if he starts getting bad again
[16:28.000 --> 16:30.000]  we got a problem and we still can't trust him
[16:30.000 --> 16:32.000]  but he's not getting
[16:32.000 --> 16:34.000]  he's not stopping his peak
[16:34.000 --> 16:36.000]  he's going like this getting better
[16:36.000 --> 16:38.000]  instead of like
[16:38.000 --> 16:40.000]  kind of this and we don't know what he's going to do
[16:40.000 --> 16:42.000]  well, no it's this
[16:42.000 --> 16:44.000]  and so
[16:44.000 --> 16:46.000]  I had dinner with a lot of people
[16:46.000 --> 16:48.000]  I told you about this on the air
[16:48.000 --> 16:50.000]  two years ago and I told you about it
[16:50.000 --> 16:52.000]  other sources and I said
[16:52.000 --> 16:54.000]  people tell me Elon Musk is a listener
[16:54.000 --> 16:56.000]  people tell me Elon Musk cares
[16:56.000 --> 16:58.000]  people tell me watch what Elon's about to do
[16:58.000 --> 17:00.000]  and Elon wants you to know he's about to do all this
[17:00.000 --> 17:02.000]  and then years later I had dinner with some other folks
[17:02.000 --> 17:04.000]  pretty close to Elon, I'll leave it at that
[17:04.000 --> 17:06.000]  you'd say extremely close
[17:06.000 --> 17:08.000]  they basically told me the same thing
[17:10.000 --> 17:12.000]  I used to joke about
[17:12.000 --> 17:14.000]  talking to Trump on the phone all the time
[17:14.000 --> 17:16.000]  and I'd say well I'll talk to someone very close
[17:16.000 --> 17:18.000]  to President Trump
[17:18.000 --> 17:20.000]  but the point is
[17:20.000 --> 17:22.000]  is that I'm not stupid
[17:22.000 --> 17:24.000]  I didn't sell out to the New World Order
[17:24.000 --> 17:26.000]  I'm not selling out to anybody because they're a billionaire
[17:26.000 --> 17:28.000]  they're powerful, I already sold out of the truth
[17:28.000 --> 17:30.000]  but
[17:30.000 --> 17:32.000]  that's what I said, I said to these people
[17:32.000 --> 17:34.000]  I said well if Elon Musk is so good
[17:34.000 --> 17:36.000]  when I was having dinner with one of his chief scientists
[17:36.000 --> 17:38.000]  a well-known household name
[17:38.000 --> 17:40.000]  I said
[17:40.000 --> 17:42.000]  if he's so good two years ago
[17:42.000 --> 17:44.000]  let me see first
[17:44.000 --> 17:46.000]  well now I've been seeing
[17:46.000 --> 17:48.000]  so I'm not up here as an apologist
[17:48.000 --> 17:50.000]  for Elon Musk and
[17:50.000 --> 17:52.000]  Gregory said well I can't even put out pieces of tackling
[17:52.000 --> 17:54.000]  I respect Gregory, I think he brings up pertinent points
[17:54.000 --> 17:56.000]  we're not running a cult here
[17:56.000 --> 17:58.000]  but you can't
[17:58.000 --> 18:00.000]  deny
[18:00.000 --> 18:02.000]  that Elon Musk is going this
[18:02.000 --> 18:04.000]  going straight up towards liberty
[18:04.000 --> 18:06.000]  while Donald Trump not going against the vaccines
[18:06.000 --> 18:08.000]  is doing this
[18:08.000 --> 18:10.000]  that mean I'm throwing Trump out
[18:10.000 --> 18:12.000]  that mean I dislike Trump, that mean I don't support Trump
[18:12.000 --> 18:14.000]  but Trump's like this
[18:14.000 --> 18:16.000]  now I'm going down a little, I'm kind of like man
[18:16.000 --> 18:18.000]  I hope he doesn't keep dropping
[18:18.000 --> 18:20.000]  if he's making that decision
[18:20.000 --> 18:22.000]  what else is he going to do
[18:22.000 --> 18:24.000]  because Elon Musk is kind of like me
[18:24.000 --> 18:26.000]  he's kind of sprawly, half-sized tree
[18:26.000 --> 18:28.000]  kind of over here
[18:28.000 --> 18:30.000]  what's the fruit on?
[18:32.000 --> 18:34.000]  and it's up to you
[18:34.000 --> 18:36.000]  to decide whether that fruit
[18:36.000 --> 18:38.000]  is good or not, you need to pick some
[18:38.000 --> 18:40.000]  you need to eat it, you need to see if it tastes good
[18:40.000 --> 18:42.000]  you need to see if it's poisonous
[18:42.000 --> 18:44.000]  you need to find out for yourself
[18:44.000 --> 18:46.000]  whether that fruit is good or not
[18:46.000 --> 18:48.000]  and so what I see happening
[18:48.000 --> 18:50.000]  at Twitter is a very positive thing
[18:50.000 --> 18:52.000]  now that said
[18:52.000 --> 18:54.000]  here's my equations
[18:54.000 --> 18:56.000]  crew came to me on Friday
[18:56.000 --> 18:58.000]  and they said
[18:58.000 --> 19:00.000]  we're going to send an official letter to Twitter
[19:00.000 --> 19:02.000]  and say we demand you reinstate us to prove you're for real
[19:02.000 --> 19:04.000]  and I said
[19:04.000 --> 19:06.000]  you notice he's creating this council
[19:06.000 --> 19:08.000]  to develop a plan
[19:08.000 --> 19:10.000]  to bring back free speech and new rules
[19:10.000 --> 19:12.000]  because you can't have calls for murder
[19:12.000 --> 19:14.000]  you can't have lettuce provocateurs on there
[19:14.000 --> 19:16.000]  they're going to be saying stuff on purpose to get him shut down
[19:16.000 --> 19:18.000]  because you know the Justice Department
[19:18.000 --> 19:20.000]  is trying to block him taking it over
[19:20.000 --> 19:22.000]  you know Biden is, you know the EU
[19:22.000 --> 19:24.000]  is already suing Twitter
[19:24.000 --> 19:26.000]  so he's got to navigate that
[19:26.000 --> 19:28.000]  I'm going to give Elon Musk
[19:28.000 --> 19:30.000]  a little breathing room
[19:32.000 --> 19:34.000]  and it's not like I need to get back on Twitter
[19:34.000 --> 19:36.000]  I want to see him make the right decision
[19:36.000 --> 19:38.000]  but he needs to do it his own time
[19:38.000 --> 19:40.000]  so if in six months
[19:40.000 --> 19:42.000]  we're not back up on Twitter
[19:44.000 --> 19:46.000]  the weight of him being incredibly good
[19:46.000 --> 19:48.000]  is a little less
[19:48.000 --> 19:50.000]  but if he's still speaking out against the shots
[19:50.000 --> 19:52.000]  in world government, AI
[19:52.000 --> 19:54.000]  new world order and censorship
[19:54.000 --> 19:56.000]  I mean he's still good
[19:56.000 --> 19:58.000]  the point is he's a lot better than
[19:58.000 --> 20:00.000]  Sundar Pachai at Google
[20:00.000 --> 20:02.000]  he's a lot better than Tim Cook at Apple
[20:02.000 --> 20:04.000]  he's a lot better than
[20:04.000 --> 20:06.000]  Mark Zuckerberg over there at
[20:06.000 --> 20:08.000]  Metta
[20:08.000 --> 20:10.000]  Facebook
[20:10.000 --> 20:12.000]  he's lost two thirds of his wealth by the way
[20:12.000 --> 20:14.000]  he's worth 140 billion now
[20:14.000 --> 20:16.000]  he's worth 40 billion
[20:16.000 --> 20:18.000]  so
[20:18.000 --> 20:20.000]  that's where I'm at
[20:20.000 --> 20:22.000]  but you've got to be as wise as a serpent
[20:22.000 --> 20:24.000]  as peaceful as a dove
[20:24.000 --> 20:26.000]  I can't just go
[20:26.000 --> 20:28.000]  and score an easy point of
[20:28.000 --> 20:30.000]  I tried to re-register on Twitter and they banned me
[20:30.000 --> 20:32.000]  he hasn't cleaned the people out yet
[20:32.000 --> 20:34.000]  he just fired the CEO and the head lawyer
[20:34.000 --> 20:36.000]  but people ask
[20:36.000 --> 20:38.000]  why would he buy this platform
[20:38.000 --> 20:40.000]  there's only five big platforms
[20:40.000 --> 20:42.000]  he wants to build InternetX
[20:42.000 --> 20:44.000]  he says it came out in the lawsuit text messages
[20:44.000 --> 20:46.000]  to then have private messaging
[20:46.000 --> 20:48.000]  and video streaming
[20:48.000 --> 20:50.000]  and everything on the platform
[20:50.000 --> 20:52.000]  that doesn't censor you because even if
[20:52.000 --> 20:54.000]  he's not a perfect person
[20:54.000 --> 20:56.000]  which none of us are
[20:56.000 --> 20:58.000]  the whole future is going to be in free open platforms
[20:58.000 --> 21:00.000]  if everybody else
[21:00.000 --> 21:02.000]  is censoring and surveilling and ripping off
[21:02.000 --> 21:04.000]  and controlling like PayPal
[21:04.000 --> 21:06.000]  which he was an early investor in
[21:06.000 --> 21:08.000]  people go oh Peter Till and
[21:08.000 --> 21:10.000]  Musk they're bad they're letting
[21:10.000 --> 21:12.000]  uh
[21:12.000 --> 21:14.000]  PayPal
[21:14.000 --> 21:16.000]  rip people off they haven't had control
[21:16.000 --> 21:18.000]  of PayPal for a decade
[21:18.000 --> 21:20.000]  I looked into it
[21:20.000 --> 21:22.000]  so let's give
[21:22.000 --> 21:24.000]  them a chance
[21:24.000 --> 21:26.000]  let's see what they do
[21:28.000 --> 21:30.000]  and let's not all run around whole
[21:30.000 --> 21:32.000]  ear than now because let me tell you
[21:32.000 --> 21:34.000]  it takes some time
[21:34.000 --> 21:36.000]  to take control of an organization
[21:36.000 --> 21:38.000]  and change the culture
[21:38.000 --> 21:40.000]  and Elon Musk has an uphill battle
[21:40.000 --> 21:42.000]  but let me say this about Elon Musk in closing
[21:42.000 --> 21:44.000]  they say
[21:44.000 --> 21:46.000]  Elon Musk
[21:48.000 --> 21:50.000]  wasn't that smart and just invested
[21:50.000 --> 21:52.000]  in some diamonds
[21:52.000 --> 21:54.000]  but he made a bunch of money and then he wasn't that smart
[21:54.000 --> 21:56.000]  he invested in PayPal big deal
[21:56.000 --> 21:58.000]  and then he wasn't that smart he invested in Tesla
[21:58.000 --> 22:00.000]  and then he wasn't that smart
[22:00.000 --> 22:02.000]  and he invested
[22:02.000 --> 22:04.000]  in space tax right at the time the US
[22:04.000 --> 22:06.000]  government dumped it
[22:06.000 --> 22:08.000]  and he wasn't that smart
[22:08.000 --> 22:10.000]  he went up against the censors
[22:10.000 --> 22:12.000]  and bought Twitter and is trying to fix it
[22:12.000 --> 22:14.000]  no obviously he's smart folks
[22:14.000 --> 22:16.000]  and if he can have be bold
[22:16.000 --> 22:18.000]  and buy Twitter
[22:18.000 --> 22:20.000]  he's a good guy in my view
[22:20.000 --> 22:22.000]  to try to change it and if he can do it
[22:24.000 --> 22:26.000]  well that's something else no obviously
[22:26.000 --> 22:28.000]  Elon Musk
[22:28.000 --> 22:30.000]  is engaged
[22:30.000 --> 22:32.000]  and is smart
[22:32.000 --> 22:34.000]  and is involved and engaged
[22:34.000 --> 22:36.000]  and he's either
[22:36.000 --> 22:38.000]  the next level evil
[22:38.000 --> 22:40.000]  he is engaged and he's reached out
[22:40.000 --> 22:42.000]  and he's acting like he's a nice guy
[22:42.000 --> 22:44.000]  or
[22:44.000 --> 22:46.000]  he is
[22:46.000 --> 22:48.000]  the real deal
[22:48.000 --> 22:50.000]  and wants to build a pro-human future
[22:50.000 --> 22:52.000]  now that said I've read his writings
[22:52.000 --> 22:54.000]  he says I don't want to make you take a brain chip
[22:54.000 --> 22:56.000]  if you want one we're going to sell it to you
[22:56.000 --> 22:58.000]  he just knows where things are going
[22:58.000 --> 23:00.000]  so that's that kind of libertarian angle
[23:00.000 --> 23:02.000]  on that
[23:02.000 --> 23:04.000]  and I'm sitting back thinking
[23:04.000 --> 23:06.000]  well my uncle was in a motorcycle accident
[23:06.000 --> 23:08.000]  and he had epilepsy
[23:08.000 --> 23:10.000]  so bad he was in a wheelchair
[23:10.000 --> 23:12.000]  and first he got a vegas nerve stimulator
[23:12.000 --> 23:14.000]  then he actually got a few years ago a chip
[23:14.000 --> 23:16.000]  in his brain
[23:16.000 --> 23:18.000]  and now he feels great and is running around having a great life
[23:18.000 --> 23:20.000]  and looks like he's 20 years younger
[23:20.000 --> 23:22.000]  a brain chip
[23:22.000 --> 23:24.000]  in and of itself is not evil
[23:24.000 --> 23:26.000]  just like a prosthetic leg isn't evil
[23:26.000 --> 23:28.000]  it's who programs it
[23:28.000 --> 23:30.000]  who controls it and what you've got to give up
[23:30.000 --> 23:32.000]  to have access to it
[23:32.000 --> 23:34.000]  and that's what the social credit score is
[23:34.000 --> 23:36.000]  if I got hit by a car next week
[23:36.000 --> 23:38.000]  and broke my neck
[23:38.000 --> 23:40.000]  and they said we can put a chip in your brain stem
[23:40.000 --> 23:42.000]  where you get to walk again
[23:42.000 --> 23:44.000]  I'd say put that sucker in
[23:44.000 --> 23:46.000]  unless
[23:46.000 --> 23:48.000]  there was strings attached that it would control me
[23:48.000 --> 23:50.000]  the technology like a gun
[23:50.000 --> 23:52.000]  is not bad
[23:52.000 --> 23:54.000]  a car is not bad but that psycho Daryl Brooks
[23:54.000 --> 23:56.000]  used in Kenosha
[23:56.000 --> 23:58.000]  or the white supremacist comeback used to kill those black folks
[23:58.000 --> 24:00.000]  in Buffalo a few months ago
[24:00.000 --> 24:02.000]  the gun's not bad
[24:02.000 --> 24:04.000]  the white supremacist, the black supremacist
[24:04.000 --> 24:06.000]  is who is bad
[24:06.000 --> 24:08.000]  and so I'm all about technology
[24:08.000 --> 24:10.000]  but open source free
[24:10.000 --> 24:12.000]  that's been tested and that people have a choice on
[24:12.000 --> 24:14.000]  unlike these nano tech vaccines
[24:14.000 --> 24:16.000]  that are put in people
[24:16.000 --> 24:18.000]  but that said
[24:18.000 --> 24:20.000]  Elon Musk pushing his neuro link is creepy as hell
[24:22.000 --> 24:24.000]  but it seems like he wants to be involved in everything
[24:24.000 --> 24:26.000]  flamethrowers, I mean the list goes on and on
[24:26.000 --> 24:28.000]  we'll see but
[24:28.000 --> 24:30.000]  let me tell you, Elon Musk has done nothing but impressed me
[24:30.000 --> 24:32.000]  the last two years
[24:32.000 --> 24:34.000]  and I was told get ready, see what Elon's going to do
[24:38.000 --> 24:40.000]  but see, that's the thing about sociopaths
[24:42.000 --> 24:44.000]  and psychopaths
[24:44.000 --> 24:46.000]  you'd think they do stuff that even helped them
[24:46.000 --> 24:48.000]  in the future even if it was pro-human
[24:48.000 --> 24:50.000]  but most globalists will go against humanity
[24:50.000 --> 24:52.000]  even if it hurts them
[24:52.000 --> 24:54.000]  maybe Elon Musk
[24:54.000 --> 24:56.000]  is a good sociopath, I mean I'm not saying
[24:56.000 --> 24:58.000]  that's such a thing
[24:58.000 --> 25:00.000]  he just thinks a pro-human future is the way to go
[25:00.000 --> 25:02.000]  people want freedom, why not give it to them
[25:02.000 --> 25:04.000]  but the globalists
[25:04.000 --> 25:06.000]  they're not giving you freedom
[25:08.000 --> 25:10.000]  they're giving you slavery
[25:10.000 --> 25:12.000]  ladies and gentlemen
[25:12.000 --> 25:14.000]  you know what's a pacemaker in your heart
[25:14.000 --> 25:16.000]  it's a microchip, it's a system
[25:16.000 --> 25:18.000]  electrochemical simulator
[25:18.000 --> 25:20.000]  it's robot control
[25:20.000 --> 25:22.000]  are you against that, no
[25:22.000 --> 25:24.000]  I ever started having defibrillation problems
[25:24.000 --> 25:26.000]  I started having arrhythmias
[25:26.000 --> 25:28.000]  I'm going to get a pacemaker
[25:28.000 --> 25:30.000]  I've got another family member
[25:32.000 --> 25:34.000]  who waited a long time to get a pacemaker
[25:34.000 --> 25:36.000]  it was in a lot of hell and a heart attack
[25:36.000 --> 25:38.000]  finally got it, man they're climbing mountains now
[25:38.000 --> 25:40.000]  that's a great piece of technology
[25:40.000 --> 25:42.000]  right there
[25:44.000 --> 25:46.000]  but again
[25:46.000 --> 25:48.000]  what comes with it
[25:48.000 --> 25:50.000]  that's the issue
[25:50.000 --> 25:52.000]  and we don't want technology programmed by a central system
[25:52.000 --> 25:54.000]  and if they can censor what you say on Facebook
[25:54.000 --> 25:56.000]  or Twitter
[25:56.000 --> 25:58.000]  they can censor what goes into your brain chip
[25:58.000 --> 26:00.000]  or in your heart chip or your hip chip
[26:00.000 --> 26:02.000]  or your back chip or any of it
[26:02.000 --> 26:04.000]  God gave us all this technology
[26:04.000 --> 26:06.000]  to use and to build our future
[26:06.000 --> 26:08.000]  but it serves us, not them
[26:08.000 --> 26:10.000]  that's a prime rule
[26:10.000 --> 26:12.000]  in my rules
[26:12.000 --> 26:14.000]  where I think the future should be run
[26:14.000 --> 26:16.000]  and I'm not going to force my rules down your throat
[26:16.000 --> 26:18.000]  I'm going to promote them and see if you agree with me
[26:18.000 --> 26:20.000]  we're going to go to these interviews now
[26:20.000 --> 26:22.000]  I want to hit a few more of these tweets
[26:22.000 --> 26:24.000]  when someone accuses you
[26:24.000 --> 26:26.000]  of wearing a tin full hat remind them
[26:26.000 --> 26:28.000]  it's better than wearing a blindfold
[26:28.000 --> 26:30.000]  I want to frame that and put it on the wall
[26:32.000 --> 26:34.000]  why is Fox 10 calling the election
[26:34.000 --> 26:36.000]  12 days before election day
[26:36.000 --> 26:38.000]  she said those two days ago
[26:38.000 --> 26:40.000]  Carrie Lake
[26:40.000 --> 26:42.000]  she's really
[26:42.000 --> 26:44.000]  10 points ahead, Carrie Lake is
[26:44.000 --> 26:46.000]  of Katie Hobbs and all the major polls
[26:46.000 --> 26:48.000]  but Fox always goes for the Democrat
[26:48.000 --> 26:52.000]  they're saying she's going to win
[26:52.000 --> 26:54.000]  look how angry
[26:54.000 --> 26:56.000]  the Twitter lawyer was
[26:56.000 --> 26:58.000]  when Elon came in
[26:58.000 --> 27:00.000]  couldn't even hide her staying and who she worked for
[27:00.000 --> 27:02.000]  what she was doing

[29:13.440 --> 29:21.280]  in here, I'm just like you. I ran out of X3 a couple weeks ago. Just remembered today

[30:34.320 --> 30:38.960]  X3 will change your life is that it's not going to most people have iodine deficiencies. The daily
[30:38.960 --> 30:42.960]  allowance they claim is way lower than you need. They bomb you with the fluoride, the chlorine,
[30:42.960 --> 30:46.320]  the bromide, the bromine, all the bad halogens. It's the good halogen.
[30:48.560 --> 30:54.560]  You need it. You should get it. And it funds our operation. And we are in Chapter 11 Subjection
[30:54.560 --> 30:59.680]  5 bankruptcy, which is reorganization, not liquidation. But if we don't make the numbers
[31:00.880 --> 31:05.040]  to be able to fund things, then they can go into liquidation. Another three months,
[31:05.040 --> 31:08.240]  the bankruptcy left because our last CRO got fired by the judge and all the rest of it.
[31:08.240 --> 31:14.480]  And as long as we can prove we're a little bit profitable and that future profits years from
[31:14.480 --> 31:19.520]  now, we'll go to the lefties, whatever, we will stay on air. They can't control our speech. They're
[31:19.520 --> 31:25.360]  so pissed by what they call loophole. That's just federal law in this common sense that you can't
[31:25.360 --> 31:29.280]  fire this whole crew and get rid of us. This is you have your big, fake rig judgments that
[31:29.280 --> 31:34.800]  we're appealing because we're in Chapter 11 Subjection, Sub Chapter 5. But just go to infowarstore.com
[31:34.800 --> 31:40.880]  now and get X3, get DNA Force Plus, get Vita Mineral Fusion. It's the last few days, should have

[31:46.560 --> 31:52.480]  great job to everybody. Roger Stone's coming up after the break. Then we're going to have Mark
[31:52.480 --> 31:58.960]  Passio and Acharya G and so many others here today. But whatever you do, take action now.

[33:13.600 --> 33:32.160]  And we are back for the special Saturday emergency transmission. Three big guests
[33:32.720 --> 33:40.480]  coming up as I promised you. Roger Stone joins us on the Saturday, October 29th, 2022 special
[33:40.480 --> 33:48.960]  transmission with only a few days left, 10 days left until the historic midterms. He is here to
[33:48.960 --> 33:54.000]  give his current analysis. Will it be a Democrat bloodbath? How will election fraud weigh in?
[33:54.000 --> 33:58.000]  The Democrats are now saying Republicans are planning to steal it. All simultaneously saying
[33:58.000 --> 34:03.440]  there's no such thing as election fraud. We'll also be looking forward into 2024 with more and
[34:03.440 --> 34:09.680]  more evidence that the sanis is going to run directly against President Trump or as Roger
[34:09.680 --> 34:17.680]  Stone calls him the champ. So former chief political advisor to Donald Trump, Roger Stone joins us to
[34:17.680 --> 34:24.720]  cover the waterfront. Roger, exciting times. It really is Alex. Look, I want to be as clear as I
[34:24.720 --> 34:30.160]  possibly can. I'm strongly supporting Ron DeSantis for reelection. In fact, I've already voted and
[34:30.160 --> 34:37.200]  I voted for him as is every member of our family. But everybody here in Florida was shocked in the
[34:37.200 --> 34:45.840]  debate between he and Charlie Christ earlier this week when Chris put the question to him,
[34:45.840 --> 34:52.480]  Governor, will you pledge to serve all four years if reelected or are you going to abandon
[34:52.480 --> 35:00.320]  Florida to run for president? And DeSantis hedged. He tried to finesse that question. The key point
[35:00.320 --> 35:08.080]  of course is that he didn't say yes and give that pledge. Alex, I had to go to DEF CON 4. I had no
[35:08.080 --> 35:16.560]  choice because of the history here. Many people who aren't Floridians may not know that Ron DeSantis
[35:16.560 --> 35:23.360]  was a relatively unknown congressman, a member of the Freedom Caucus, but the Republican establishment
[35:23.360 --> 35:30.480]  here in Florida, every Republican county chairman, every Republican state legislator in the state
[35:30.480 --> 35:36.160]  house and the state Senate, every member of the Republican congressional delegation, with the
[35:36.160 --> 35:43.600]  exception of my friend Matt Gaetz, had all endorsed Adam Putnam, the Rhino establishment,
[35:43.600 --> 35:50.240]  who was very far ahead in the polls. It was only a tweeted Donald Trump endorsement
[35:50.240 --> 35:56.960]  that catapulted DeSantis out of obscurity to the Republican nomination. And then
[35:58.160 --> 36:04.640]  Trump came here in the final two weeks of that campaign season and literally dragged Ron DeSantis
[36:04.640 --> 36:12.400]  over the finish line by a mere 34,000 votes. So I've been in politics a long time, Alex.
[36:12.400 --> 36:18.320]  I know you feel the same way as I do in the sense that loyalty is very important. Gratitude
[36:18.320 --> 36:23.840]  is very important. I want Ron DeSantis for governor. He's doing a great job now in his
[36:23.840 --> 36:29.680]  second part of his first term. He's been great on the culture wars. He's been great taking on
[36:29.680 --> 36:38.640]  those who try to force sex and gender and racial lies on our schoolchildren. He's been very good
[36:38.640 --> 36:43.520]  finally on the vaccinations after advocating them for the first two years of his term.
[36:43.520 --> 36:50.320]  But now I think it's an open secret among the Republican establishment in Florida
[36:50.320 --> 36:57.120]  that Ron DeSantis is going to challenge the champ. And since you mentioned the debate and
[36:57.120 --> 37:01.920]  what the challenge are brought up to Governor DeSantis, let's go ahead and roll that clip.
[37:03.920 --> 37:08.880]  And Ron, Ron, you talk about Joe Biden a lot. I understand. You think you're going to be running
[37:08.880 --> 37:12.880]  against him. I can see how you might get confused, but you're running for governor.
[37:12.880 --> 37:17.680]  You're running for governor. And I have a question for you. You're running for governor. Why don't
[37:17.680 --> 37:21.840]  you look in the eyes of the people of the state of Florida and say to them, if you're reelected,
[37:21.840 --> 37:32.160]  you will serve a full four year term as governor? Yes or no? Yes or no, Ron? Will you serve a full
[37:32.160 --> 37:38.000]  four year term if you're reelected governor of Florida? It's not a tough question. It's a fair
[37:38.000 --> 37:43.280]  question. He won't tell you. So you made a big deal of this, Roger. You've been saying this for
[37:43.280 --> 37:49.680]  the last year. Roger Stone warns DeSantis it would be treachery to run against Trump. You've
[37:49.680 --> 37:54.880]  recently said that again. Look, people are allowed to vote for who they want, but even
[37:54.880 --> 38:02.240]  national polls still show Trump getting a much bigger percentage than DeSantis. I want whoever
[38:02.240 --> 38:08.640]  is a good candidate that will defeat the Democrat machine. Where do you see this going? Well,
[38:08.640 --> 38:15.200]  I think there's more to the story now, Alex. President Trump announced two days ago that he
[38:15.200 --> 38:21.680]  was going to have a massive pre-election rally November 6th in Miami with Senator Marco Rubio,
[38:21.680 --> 38:28.960]  who is in a tough but I think winning race for the U.S. Senate. Then Governor DeSantis announced
[38:28.960 --> 38:36.560]  that he would have a rally the same day at the same time in Tampa. So we have dueling rallies.
[38:37.200 --> 38:43.840]  Ironically, Sun City Center in Tampa was the exact location where only one year ago,
[38:43.840 --> 38:50.640]  Ron DeSantis held a press conference to advocate for the vaccination. Look, here's what I don't
[38:50.640 --> 38:57.600]  want, Alex. I don't want a split in the MAGA majority within our party. I think those who
[38:57.600 --> 39:03.600]  want to put America first should stick together because if there's a split, I can see a Mitt
[39:03.600 --> 39:11.280]  Romney or even, God forbid, a Liz Cheney or some other Rhino candidate taking advantage of that
[39:11.280 --> 39:18.640]  division and trying to launch a campaign to take back the Republican party. Why doesn't DeSantis just
[39:18.640 --> 39:23.040]  be Trump's VP? I know they're both from Florida, but Trump could argue that he still lives in New
[39:23.040 --> 39:29.520]  York or New Jersey or anywhere he wants. Here's the fundamental problem with that. Donald Trump
[39:29.520 --> 39:36.640]  does not want to pay New York or New Jersey state income taxes. Florida has no income tax,
[39:37.360 --> 39:43.440]  and Donald Trump is now legally a Floridian. The Electoral College, while it does not
[39:44.240 --> 39:50.160]  prohibit the presidential and vice presidential candidate from being from the same state,
[39:50.160 --> 39:56.080]  what it does is penalize you, meaning you would forfeit the votes of Florida in the Electoral
[39:56.080 --> 40:02.640]  College if a Trump DeSantis ticket, in this case, carried the state of Florida. We can't afford to
[40:02.640 --> 40:08.800]  forfeit 27 electoral votes. Obviously, the governor of Florida can't move, but Donald Trump,
[40:08.800 --> 40:14.800]  particularly given the harassment of the New York state attorney general, there's no reason why he
[40:14.800 --> 40:20.000]  wants to go back to paying massive state income taxes. Let me raise this. Robert Barnes is a smart
[40:20.000 --> 40:25.840]  guy. I respect him. He's right, probably 95% of the time. He did some work for Trump during the
[40:25.840 --> 40:31.360]  2020 campaign exposing election fraud. He says he's talked to lawyers that were in the room
[40:31.360 --> 40:37.440]  over a year ago when DeSantis and Trump were meeting and that the agreement was made that
[40:37.440 --> 40:42.640]  either DeSantis wasn't going to run or he'd run as Trump's VP. And I said, really, Barnes,
[40:42.640 --> 40:46.640]  you really talked to lawyers that were in the room and said that and he said yes. Do you think
[40:46.640 --> 40:51.760]  he's being fed a lot of bull or do you think he's right? Yeah, I think that is categorically false.
[40:51.760 --> 40:55.680]  Now, I like Robert. I think he's a good guy. He would never intentionally lie,
[40:55.680 --> 41:02.720]  but somebody is giving him a false narrative. Look, you know, Ron DeSantis went to Yale,
[41:02.720 --> 41:09.760]  where he was sculling bones. He went to Harvard. He voted for TPP when he was in the Congress.
[41:09.760 --> 41:17.760]  You have, he has $200 million that has been put together by 42 billionaires in a secret slush fund.
[41:17.760 --> 41:24.480]  He's only going to end up spending about 50 million of that in the governor's race or less.
[41:24.480 --> 41:30.400]  He is going to win. I'm happy about that. But you saw that deer in the headlights look in the
[41:30.400 --> 41:38.800]  debate. He's not ready to take on Donald Trump. And then the warm endorsement of Jeb Bush of
[41:38.800 --> 41:46.560]  Ron DeSantis's reelection. This gives one very real pause. Okay, look, I understand his pedigree.
[41:46.560 --> 41:54.400]  And that makes me have some concerns. I also see the great things he's been doing. And I want to
[41:54.400 --> 41:59.120]  believe we've got some good leadership here. You know, I could talk five hours about the great
[41:59.120 --> 42:04.080]  things Trump did with the border, bringing us jobs back, you know, standing up the communist
[42:04.080 --> 42:11.760]  Chinese standing up to the left, reenergizing our military, promoting pro-American views and ideas,
[42:12.640 --> 42:17.040]  getting rid of a bunch of federal regulations that shut down US energy, making us the number one
[42:17.040 --> 42:23.040]  energy producer in the world now reversed in less than two years by Obama's third administration,
[42:23.040 --> 42:28.640]  known as the Biden administration. That said, since you keep firing out the new talking points
[42:28.640 --> 42:36.080]  against DeSantis, which I think are very legitimate, he has been walking back and his new surgeon
[42:36.080 --> 42:40.160]  general for doing a great job saying, don't give kids these poison shots. So he understands that's
[42:40.160 --> 42:46.720]  a liability as he positions himself for president. What is Trump doing? Even when Ben Shapiro that
[42:46.720 --> 42:54.400]  said, take the shots dummies, just take the shots dumbasses, we can pull up his his famous tweet,
[42:54.400 --> 43:00.880]  you know, hey dopes, just take it. His wife said three, he said two. Now he admits he was lied to,
[43:00.880 --> 43:07.040]  it's a fraud. So even if Ben Shapiro is jumping ship from the poison shots, Mr. Neocon, Mr.
[43:08.000 --> 43:13.520]  Globalist, what is going on with Trump? Here is the individual we're talking about, Ben Shapiro.
[43:14.320 --> 43:18.240]  We were lied to by the scientists. We were lied to by Pfizer. We were lied to by the government.
[43:18.240 --> 43:22.160]  We were lied to by the Biden administration. We were lied to. I don't like being lied to. I don't
[43:22.160 --> 43:28.880]  know about you. And it makes me not believe these people. Now, as I've spoken out before,
[43:28.880 --> 43:32.960]  I got back twice or have double that's my wife being a doctor and seeing bone neural patients
[43:32.960 --> 43:40.080]  is triple that's but knowing now what I know then what knowing then what I know now rather
[43:40.080 --> 43:47.040]  what I have actually gotten back based on the information that my actual chances of death
[43:47.040 --> 43:51.360]  from COVID were exorbitantly low. And I wouldn't be preventing my parents from getting that was
[43:51.360 --> 43:54.080]  really what I was concerned about because we were bubbled with my parents. What I've gotten it.
[43:54.640 --> 44:00.480]  I don't know. I really don't know. I think maybe not because again, my personal risk when it comes
[44:00.480 --> 44:06.640]  to the vaccine was extremely low when it came to COVID. I'm a young healthy male with no pre
[44:06.640 --> 44:14.080]  existing conditions. Hey, Ben, in October of 2020, months before the shot was rolled out here in the
[44:14.080 --> 44:18.800]  US, 30 knew what was happening in the UK with the shots, massive blood clots, heart attacks,
[44:18.800 --> 44:26.400]  strokes, infertility, cancer, death, autoimmune diseases, the little liver liquefying. Ben knew
[44:26.400 --> 44:31.920]  all of this. I know Trump's not a doctor. And so I'd be happy if he walked it back. He did try
[44:31.920 --> 44:37.200]  to get us the good therapeutics. He didn't ever try to force the shots on people. And so I'm not
[44:37.200 --> 44:41.760]  trying to hang this around Trump's neck. But Roger, we've agreed for over a year, they're going to
[44:41.760 --> 44:46.880]  hang it around his neck. And so yes, I would support Trump over to San us. I've seen the proofs
[44:46.880 --> 44:52.160]  in the pudding. The deep state hates him. I am going to support President Trump for president.
[44:52.160 --> 44:57.280]  But what about the thing hurting him the most with his constituency, these experimental shots
[44:57.280 --> 45:02.480]  that he got fooled into supporting? Well, first of all, as you point out, he did come out and
[45:02.480 --> 45:08.320]  strongly say that they should not in any way be mandatory. I considered that progress in a victory.
[45:08.320 --> 45:14.480]  Now that the CDC is trying to make the mandatory for schoolchildren, I think he has a great opportunity
[45:14.480 --> 45:21.840]  to attack that bad idea. I'm sorry to hear about Ben Shapiro being triple-vaxxed. Here's a message
[45:21.840 --> 45:27.040]  to the people of the Daily Wire. When Ben's no longer available, if you need somebody to do his
[45:27.040 --> 45:33.920]  show, yes, I'm available. You know, look, Ron DeSantis is 42 years old, Alex. We need him here
[45:33.920 --> 45:40.080]  in Florida. He is now doing a great job. But we need him to stay and not just run off and run for
[45:40.080 --> 45:46.800]  president within weeks of being reelected, which is why I have brought this issue to the fore.
[45:46.800 --> 45:50.720]  Well, I agree. I mean, I mean, it's a reckless thing for him to do because he can guarantee
[45:50.720 --> 45:56.480]  he'd do two more terms as governor totally as a showcase of what he could do for America.
[45:56.480 --> 46:01.760]  And then he could be in there in four years or six years. He could be there in eight years,
[46:01.760 --> 46:07.440]  in 10 years, in 12 years. I mean, definitely he could build that dynasty like Ronald Reagan,
[46:07.440 --> 46:12.720]  and then he could be the president when he's 50 years old. Well, as you know, Alex, I always get
[46:12.720 --> 46:17.520]  right to the point and I never kind of mince words. I really think this decision is not being made by
[46:17.520 --> 46:23.680]  Governor DeSantis, but I think it's being made by Lady Macbeth herself, Ron DeSantis' wife.
[46:23.680 --> 46:28.960]  Now, in the campaign here, they have put Casey DeSantis, who's a former newscaster. She's very
[46:28.960 --> 46:34.480]  beautiful. She's very articulate. They put her up in a lot of ads because, well, their polling
[46:34.480 --> 46:40.560]  shows that Ron doesn't have that kind of warm, charming, engaging side that Donald Trump has,
[46:40.560 --> 46:46.720]  and Casey DeSantis kind of warms up his imagery. But actually, I think she's the one who's made
[46:46.720 --> 46:53.360]  the decision that he should run now. I think she is the one who is forging ahead. But it concerns
[46:53.360 --> 47:00.480]  me when, for example, in Colorado, where Joe O'Day, the Republican U.S. Senate candidate,
[47:00.480 --> 47:06.800]  an out-and-out Trump attacking rhino, says that if he gets to the Senate, he will campaign against
[47:06.800 --> 47:14.640]  Donald Trump. He would be a solid vote for Mitch McConnell and the rhinos. Governor DeSantis is
[47:14.640 --> 47:22.000]  doing robo calls for him, campaigning for him. The governor is flying to New York. He's going to
[47:22.000 --> 47:28.240]  go to Long Island this weekend. I'm happy to see this in the sense that I am for Lee Zeldin. He's
[47:28.240 --> 47:34.480]  a great guy. He is America first. But why would you, if running for reelection in Florida, why would
[47:34.480 --> 47:40.400]  you head to New York unless, of course, it was because you are building a national base to run
[47:40.400 --> 47:46.160]  for president? The reason that I wanted to bring this up on the show today is many, many, many of
[47:46.160 --> 47:52.640]  the people who like both men just don't believe that this is what the governor is going to do.
[47:52.640 --> 47:59.040]  But I'm just telling you, the plan for him to move forward with an all-out candidacy
[47:59.600 --> 48:06.240]  was revealed in this debate. That was a great clip. Charlie Christ, who has been a Republican,
[48:06.240 --> 48:11.840]  an independent, then a Democrat, who was once strongly pro-life, strongly second amendment,
[48:11.840 --> 48:17.120]  now favors abortion on demand and wants to confiscate our guns. It's really pathetic.
[48:17.120 --> 48:23.440]  Well, Roger, let's expand on this. This is giant news if Ron DeSantis is going to run for president.
[48:23.440 --> 48:29.520]  And all the moves we see show that DeSantis and Trump are at loggerheads now and that both men,
[48:29.520 --> 48:34.640]  though, that's the case. So not just the history, not just the $200 million that DeSantis has got,
[48:34.640 --> 48:39.840]  not just all the different pieces of evidence, but the way that they are basically, it looks like
[48:39.840 --> 48:45.440]  campaigning against each other already is massive. I know you talk to 45 quite often,
[48:45.440 --> 48:48.560]  but the easiest way to not talk to Trump is to talk about what you talked about with Trump.
[48:48.560 --> 48:51.840]  But clearly, he probably wants some of his feelings or ideas out there.
[48:52.720 --> 48:56.080]  What do you imagine Trump's thinking about Ron DeSantis right now?
[48:56.880 --> 49:04.000]  Well, last night on Instagram, he put up a promotion for this rally in Miami on Sunday,
[49:04.000 --> 49:10.560]  November 6th. And he specifically said he was campaigning for Rubio and only Rubio.
[49:10.560 --> 49:17.040]  I think that kind of made the point. He also put up a picture of Ron DeSantis sitting alone,
[49:17.040 --> 49:23.760]  kind of like Forrest Gump. So, look, Trump is very clever. I think that he is sending a message.
[49:23.760 --> 49:28.720]  I think, in all honesty, he's very, very disappointed. I mean, he really doesn't
[49:28.720 --> 49:34.480]  understand this. He has always been there for Ron DeSantis. When Ron DeSantis fell short of his
[49:34.480 --> 49:39.760]  fundraising goals when he was elected, Trump did fundraisers for him. He did two rallies for him,
[49:39.760 --> 49:45.840]  as I say, in the final two weeks. For a long time, President Trump just didn't want to believe this.
[49:45.840 --> 49:50.800]  People kept telling him that DeSantis is running around organizing a presidential campaign. He
[49:50.800 --> 49:57.280]  just didn't want to believe it. They had a warm relationship. It's pretty clear to me of all of
[49:57.280 --> 50:05.840]  those potential candidates who want to run in 2024. The only one who has not gone to Trump and said,
[50:05.840 --> 50:12.560]  to him, look, Mr. President, if you run, I wouldn't run. At least the only serious candidate
[50:12.560 --> 50:19.120]  is Ron DeSantis. Now, Mike Pompeo, you remember him, the CIA director under Donald Trump, the guy
[50:19.120 --> 50:24.080]  who said Julian Assange was a foreign state actor, the guy who laid the whole groundwork
[50:24.080 --> 50:29.920]  for the Russian collusion hoax. He has now kind of changed his tune. So, originally, he said he
[50:29.920 --> 50:35.680]  was interested in running for president. He wouldn't run if Trump ran. Now, seeing the split
[50:35.680 --> 50:41.440]  between DeSantis and Trump, he's slowly changing his tune and saying, well, maybe he will run.
[50:42.240 --> 50:47.680]  He, if you look before his service to the Trump administration, he's got Rhino written all over
[50:47.680 --> 50:56.000]  him. So, my real fear here is that the America first majority within our party is going to get
[50:56.000 --> 51:02.640]  divided and that that allows an establishment Republican to walk away with this nomination and
[51:02.640 --> 51:08.880]  retake the party of Lincoln, the party of Goldwater, the party of Reagan, and the party of Trump.
[51:11.600 --> 51:18.560]  Now, let's just pull back here for a moment and finish up with the shots. I made a lot of
[51:18.560 --> 51:23.440]  headlines a few months ago when I said, I'm going to support DeSantis if Trump doesn't come out
[51:23.440 --> 51:28.240]  against these shots for children. And I wanted to see what DeSantis would do because I know
[51:28.240 --> 51:32.560]  as people watch and listen, I know a lot of Floridians would contact him and then I see his
[51:32.560 --> 51:36.560]  search in general come out and say, the shots don't work. They hurt you. They hurt children.
[51:36.560 --> 51:40.720]  Now, DeSantis is starting to echo that, which is going to save a lot of lives, which is the truth.
[51:40.720 --> 51:48.400]  But my real intent was knowing that Trump is in competition or knows that DeSantis is gunning for
[51:48.400 --> 51:53.760]  him to try to get Trump to do the right thing to energize his base and save a lot of lives
[51:53.760 --> 51:58.560]  and break the back of the deep state that's rolled out this depopulation weapon. Because
[51:58.560 --> 52:04.480]  children come first. See, it goes like this, God's on top, then children, then my family,
[52:04.480 --> 52:10.960]  then my country, and then my president. Okay, so I really like Trump. I love Trump.
[52:11.680 --> 52:15.360]  I think that they stole it from him. It'd be beautiful to see him back in this time. He'll
[52:15.360 --> 52:20.720]  know the pitfalls. He's not going to back down from them. They're so scared. I want Trump in.
[52:20.720 --> 52:26.880]  I want Trump in. But you understand, I don't do politics, Roger. I go after issues that I think
[52:26.880 --> 52:33.120]  are the right thing because God's watching me. And so I still support Trump because of all the
[52:33.120 --> 52:37.360]  great things he's done and all the great Republicans he's getting elected and the great job he's doing.
[52:38.080 --> 52:43.520]  But except for the turd and the punch bowl, what can we do to get him to stop being pigheaded?
[52:44.560 --> 52:49.600]  Well, Alex, I think we're doing it right now. As Donald Trump would see, let's see what happens.
[52:49.600 --> 52:56.320]  He often says that. Let's see what happens. I think the CDC decision to try to force the
[52:56.320 --> 53:02.080]  vaccination on schoolchildren puts this issue front and center again. So let's see what the
[53:02.080 --> 53:07.920]  president says. Believe me, Alex, he saw your broadcast. He has great affection for you.
[53:08.480 --> 53:16.320]  He's well aware of the pivotal role that InfoWars played in his initial nomination in 2016.
[53:16.320 --> 53:21.920]  He has great personal affection for you. He knows you have been vilified because of your
[53:21.920 --> 53:29.120]  support for him. So let's see what happens. In the meantime, however, you raised an important
[53:29.120 --> 53:38.560]  point at the very top. The efforts of the Democrats to shift all focus to this attack on Paul Pelosi
[53:38.560 --> 53:47.920]  in his home, claiming that this is an example of the violence among MAGA Republicans, really
[53:47.920 --> 53:53.680]  shows you how incredibly desperate they are about these upcoming elections. There are three
[53:53.680 --> 53:58.480]  triggers here, in my opinion. When the Democrats say the Republicans are going to cut your social
[53:58.480 --> 54:08.560]  security, they're going to cut your Medicare, and this new effort to reinvent the narrative
[54:08.560 --> 54:15.760]  regarding this attack on the speaker's husband, this shows you rank desperation. The numbers are
[54:15.760 --> 54:24.000]  sliding very fast on the Democrats. The Senate now appears to be within reach. Herschel Walker,
[54:24.000 --> 54:31.760]  who many had written off for dead, now leading in his race. If you saw that debate, it was epic.
[54:32.400 --> 54:38.240]  Warnock raises the questions about Herschel Walker's mental stability, but people have forgotten
[54:38.240 --> 54:46.480]  that Warnock ran over his wife with a car after a domestic dispute. So who's mentally unbalanced?
[54:46.480 --> 54:55.680]  Roger, I'm glad you raised the situation with Pelosi's husband and how they're now trying to
[54:55.680 --> 55:00.880]  connect it to QAnon or something. And then Senator Paul comes out and says, you know,
[55:00.880 --> 55:05.680]  I'm really sorry to hear about how you were attacked, and we should all be against violence.
[55:05.680 --> 55:11.520]  And then Democrats make fun of it and celebrate it. Rex Chapman calls Rand Paul a little bitch
[55:11.520 --> 55:17.120]  for wishing Paul Pelosi speedy recovery. So they are just getting so incredibly nasty,
[55:17.120 --> 55:22.240]  and after they burned down, you know, half the United States, nobody's buying into their January
[55:22.240 --> 55:27.520]  six narrative. I agree with you that the evidence shows they're looking at a political bloodbath
[55:27.520 --> 55:30.800]  with 10 days left. What rabbits could they pull from their hat?
[55:32.000 --> 55:38.480]  Well, you can see the way they're trying to reinvent this particular event. This fellow who
[55:38.480 --> 55:45.520]  attacked Pelosi at 2 30 in the morning, first of all, clearly there consensually. Pelosi is not
[55:45.520 --> 55:50.880]  the one who called the police, the neighbors called the police. The glass that is broken is
[55:50.880 --> 55:56.800]  broken from the outside from the inside, not the outside. So unlikely that he broke in.
[55:57.680 --> 56:05.920]  This guy's wife is a woman named Gypsy Taub. She is a ethnic Russian with a lefty connections.
[56:05.920 --> 56:12.480]  The man, I think his name is dupe. This guy is makes hemp jewelry. Does he sound like a right
[56:12.480 --> 56:18.960]  winger to you? And if you look at his Facebook pages, and you look at the writings of his wife,
[56:18.960 --> 56:25.760]  Gypsy Taub, she clearly wrote this stuff. You can you can see this. This is a Foghazy, as we would
[56:25.760 --> 56:31.360]  say back in the old neighborhood. And if this is what they're running on, they're going to lose.
[56:31.360 --> 56:38.000]  The American people are focused on gasoline prices. They're focused on food shortages.
[56:38.000 --> 56:44.240]  They're focused on the epic inflation that's destroying the buying power of the dollar for
[56:44.240 --> 56:50.080]  working families across the country. They can't understand why we're shipping billions of dollars
[56:50.560 --> 56:59.440]  to the Ukraine, walking us to up to the brink of of World War Three when we can't spend millions
[56:59.440 --> 57:06.560]  of dollars just to seal our southern border in order to end the crime and drug epidemic
[57:07.280 --> 57:16.240]  in America. I had dinner the other night with a very prominent former Democrat US Senator who
[57:16.240 --> 57:21.520]  served on the Foreign Affairs Committee when he was in the Senate. And although he is a loyal
[57:21.520 --> 57:28.080]  Democrat, he pointed out to me that we signed a treaty in 1994 with the Russians in which we
[57:28.080 --> 57:36.720]  absolutely guaranteed and agreed that we would not have Ukraine join NATO. In other words, we would
[57:36.720 --> 57:44.560]  not put NATO missiles, Western missiles funded by the United States, pointed at Russia on the ground
[57:44.560 --> 57:50.320]  in NATO, and that we are now violating that agreement. If you simply go out and say that,
[57:50.320 --> 57:57.600]  as I have, as you have Alex, as Tucker Carlson has done and others, we get attacked as Putin,
[57:57.600 --> 58:04.240]  puppets, which is absurd because in my case, I had members of my family mowed down by Russian
[58:04.240 --> 58:11.440]  tanks in Budapest in 1956. I have no illusions. Absolutely. And nobody's buying that. So what is
[58:11.440 --> 58:17.600]  your now 10 days out? What is your quick snapshot, current prediction, the way things are going now?
[58:17.600 --> 58:22.800]  What happens in 10 days? I think we're going to take control of the House. I think that the
[58:22.800 --> 58:29.120]  Senate is really, really close. We're either going to win or lose by a one or two seat majority.
[58:30.000 --> 58:36.320]  But our greatest enemy here, Alex, is overconfidence. Our greatest enemy is believing
[58:36.880 --> 58:41.680]  that there's a red wave in the bag, and therefore I don't need to worry too much about it.
[58:42.480 --> 58:49.760]  They will cheat. I am a proponent of voting on election day. I saw a piece yesterday by
[58:49.760 --> 58:54.640]  Dick Morris. Remember him? He was the guy who breathed life back into the political career of
[58:54.640 --> 59:00.480]  Bill Clinton. He says, we're making a giant mistake by voting on election day. The Republicans
[59:01.600 --> 59:09.600]  should be trying to rack up early votes by mail and absentee voter mailing. Last I heard Dick
[59:09.600 --> 59:15.440]  Morris was a Democrat, so I don't know why he's giving Republicans advice. But I don't agree with
[59:15.440 --> 59:22.640]  that. I believe that by voting on election day, those who would try to game the system are unable
[59:22.640 --> 59:29.280]  to do so because they don't know how many fraudulent votes to try to steal. Therefore, everybody
[59:29.280 --> 59:36.240]  must vote. That's the first and most important thing. Your friends, your family, your circle of
[59:36.240 --> 59:46.080]  business contacts, your social contacts, every single vote must be cast. But I'm a strong proponent
[59:46.080 --> 59:52.960]  in complete disagreement with Dick Morris. I think voting on election day is more effective.
[59:52.960 --> 59:58.720]  This was proven in the Arizona primaries, by the way. Oh, that's my last question.
[59:58.720 --> 01:00:05.600]  Well, what do you make of them trying to say that Kerry Lake had people attack her faltering
[01:00:05.600 --> 01:00:10.320]  opponents election headquarters with no evidence? It's the same thing with this whole Pelosi
[01:00:10.320 --> 01:00:14.640]  husband thing being attacked. Again, when the police get there, he's in his underwear, like you
[01:00:14.640 --> 01:00:20.080]  said, with the glass smashed outward. I mean, this is just out of control. People aren't going to buy
[01:00:20.080 --> 01:00:25.120]  this victimhood of the Democrats unless it's something really big, like a provocateur terror
[01:00:25.120 --> 01:00:30.560]  attack like the Whitmer situation in Michigan, but with actual violence. That's what I'm concerned
[01:00:30.560 --> 01:00:35.760]  about, Roger. Yeah, I totally agree with you, Alex. I think that they are fronding around trying to
[01:00:35.760 --> 01:00:41.920]  find an October surprise. Their big January six subpoena for Donald Trump, in which, by the way,
[01:00:41.920 --> 01:00:47.360]  the very first paragraph of the subpoena was an attempt to get all communications between
[01:00:47.360 --> 01:00:54.240]  Donald Trump and Roger Stone from November 20 November 3 2020 to the current time.
[01:00:54.240 --> 01:01:00.320]  Will they be disappointed in that? Because there are no conversations regarding January 6
[01:01:01.040 --> 01:01:07.600]  or the in the meter aftermath of the election. So that was a flop. That came and went in the
[01:01:07.600 --> 01:01:14.720]  media like that. Nobody's interested in January 6. Nobody's interested in the effort to hold
[01:01:14.720 --> 01:01:20.320]  Donald Trump to a completely different standard regarding his handling of presidential documents.
[01:01:20.320 --> 01:01:27.040]  We now know definitively George H. W. Bush, Barack Obama, George W. Bush all retained
[01:01:27.040 --> 01:01:32.240]  documents, including classified documents after their presidencies. None of them were prosecuted
[01:01:32.240 --> 01:01:39.280]  for that. They're desperate to try to make this an issue to distract from gas prices, food shortages,
[01:01:39.280 --> 01:01:44.640]  inflation. Absolutely. And by the way, Alex, that's my greatest concern.
[01:01:44.640 --> 01:01:51.360]  What if they decide to push the nuclear trigger between now and November? What if they are willing
[01:01:51.360 --> 01:01:59.600]  to go to a devastating world war in order to try to rally people behind the commander-in-chief?
[01:01:59.600 --> 01:02:06.560]  They are not above that, sadly. This is my greatest single fear. Pushing Putin, who's a bad guy,
[01:02:07.200 --> 01:02:12.720]  into a corner where the hardline generals in Russia are asking him what he's waiting for.
[01:02:12.720 --> 01:02:20.080]  Why doesn't he just go ahead and use tactical weapons? This is what weakness provides. This
[01:02:20.080 --> 01:02:27.040]  is what provocation provides. We're right on the precipice of a nuclear war.
[01:02:27.040 --> 01:02:34.560]  And, Roger, let me just back up in closing what you're saying. On Friday, as you know,
[01:02:34.560 --> 01:02:39.120]  the Pentagon came out and said, we now reserve the right to strike non-nuclear targets, even
[01:02:39.120 --> 01:02:45.200]  if no one's attacked us, poking and prodding the Russians to escalate. So the deep state's very
[01:02:45.200 --> 01:02:49.200]  desperate. And so people should not take this election for granted. We should all be praying.
[01:02:49.200 --> 01:02:55.280]  We should all be politically active. We should all be looking for false flags. Again, the best
[01:02:55.280 --> 01:03:01.920]  site for people to visit is stonezone.com. And, Roger, in the next 10 days, I'd like to get updates
[01:03:01.920 --> 01:03:07.600]  from you every single day, election night. We are going to be going until midnight here with a
[01:03:07.600 --> 01:03:12.320]  special live broadcast. I'd love to have you co-hosted. If you're not going to be doing it in
[01:03:12.320 --> 01:03:17.120]  Florida, we'd love to have you come to Austin and co-host like we've done before during the 2016
[01:03:17.120 --> 01:03:21.680]  election and others, stonezone.com. Roger Stone, thank you so much for the time.
[01:03:22.800 --> 01:03:27.920]  Alex, it's great to be with you. And I look forward to both of us being restored to Twitter.
[01:03:27.920 --> 01:03:32.800]  There's a bunch of menopausal bitties on there who are critics of mine. I think they're probably on
[01:03:32.800 --> 01:03:37.280]  the verge of suicide right now. No, I won't say their names that would make them important,
[01:03:37.280 --> 01:03:44.480]  but hats off to Elon Musk for returning to the precepts of free speech. And we'll work something
[01:03:44.480 --> 01:03:48.160]  out for election night. That would be fun. Thank you very much. We'll talk to you soon, Roger.
[01:03:49.600 --> 01:03:52.960]  All right, we're going to go to a quick break. And we're going to come back with a very special
[01:03:52.960 --> 01:03:57.360]  guest that I've known for eight years. And then in the last five or so, I've read several of his
[01:03:57.360 --> 01:04:04.400]  books, but I've personally gotten to have dinner with him and like three hour dinners. And I'm like,
[01:04:04.400 --> 01:04:09.840]  man, you got to go on air and lay out your knowledge of history and the globalist and the
[01:04:09.840 --> 01:04:14.720]  New World Order and where everything's going because this guy is as articulate and interesting
[01:04:14.720 --> 01:04:19.840]  as somebody like David Ike. But outside of his international community he's involved in. A lot
[01:04:19.840 --> 01:04:24.240]  of folks don't know who he is. A lot of prominent people know who he is. A lot of thought leaders
[01:04:24.240 --> 01:04:28.880]  do, but a lot of the general public don't. So I'm going to try to get him to actually flesh out his
[01:04:28.880 --> 01:04:34.240]  world view on the New World Order and the globalist and so much more. I'll introduce you to Acharya
[01:04:34.240 --> 01:04:41.520]  on the other side. Stay with us. Once a tragedy reaches a level of national significance, American
[01:04:41.520 --> 01:04:48.320]  citizens should be allowed to basically question that event in any way that they deem fit. The
[01:04:48.320 --> 01:04:52.640]  First Amendment is unique in the world. That's what they want to take away, your ability to speak
[01:04:52.640 --> 01:04:56.240]  freely. So they're going to go from Mike Lindell next, or they're going to go for Steve Bannon,
[01:04:56.240 --> 01:05:00.320]  or they're going to go for Tucker Carlson. I studied the globalist 30 years ago, but on air 28
[01:05:00.320 --> 01:05:05.040]  years. And I knew they were planning all of this. And I warned the public as a modern Paul Revere.
[01:05:05.040 --> 01:05:08.960]  But I couldn't have done it without your support. And now because we've been so successful warning
[01:05:08.960 --> 01:05:13.440]  the population of the planet, not just America, we're public enemy number one when it comes to
[01:05:13.440 --> 01:05:18.160]  globalist agenda. That's why it's more important than ever to realize how successful Info Wars has
[01:05:18.160 --> 01:05:22.800]  been because of your past support. So I salute you and I thank you. And I ask you now, the critical
[01:05:22.800 --> 01:05:27.520]  juncture of the battle, free double your efforts of visiting infowarstore.com and getting amazing
[01:05:27.520 --> 01:05:34.080]  products that keep us on air 1776. The promo code, the destination is infowarstore.com.
[01:05:34.080 --> 01:05:35.520]  And I thank you all for your support.
[01:05:35.520 --> 01:05:50.240]  Info Wars, tomorrow's news today.
[01:05:50.240 --> 01:06:08.160]  From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[01:06:10.640 --> 01:06:15.920]  Well, about six months ago, I was given a copy by a friend of the principles of perfect leadership
[01:06:15.920 --> 01:06:23.760]  by a good friend of mine, Acharya G. And I'd read some of his other books that they were
[01:06:23.760 --> 01:06:27.920]  interesting and informative. But this one really blew me away the way he cut right to the chase
[01:06:28.480 --> 01:06:34.720]  with how we have a crisis of leadership. And so there's so many reasons I want to get him on.
[01:06:34.720 --> 01:06:39.200]  I've wanted to get him on for years, but now it's happening. Just his knowledge of history
[01:06:39.200 --> 01:06:47.120]  and geopolitical systems and the culture wars and good and evil. And I've run into a lot of
[01:06:47.120 --> 01:06:54.320]  Hindus, both who are Indian or who are European or American. I mean, look at Tulsi Gabbard's how,
[01:06:54.320 --> 01:07:00.080]  you know, dialed in and smart she is, who really have a very populous pro human or in many cases,
[01:07:00.080 --> 01:07:04.960]  very conservative worldview. And so I thought it was interesting with the crises between Islam
[01:07:04.960 --> 01:07:09.360]  and the Hindus, which they think is one of the main kickoff points for World War Three,
[01:07:09.360 --> 01:07:14.080]  not as Ukraine and what's happening with China. And just all of it is so interesting. So he's
[01:07:14.080 --> 01:07:19.040]  only with us about 45 minutes or so commercial free. And we have another big guest joining us.
[01:07:19.840 --> 01:07:23.360]  But I want to talk about the book. I ended up leaving it on my kitchen table this morning and
[01:07:23.360 --> 01:07:28.160]  forgetting it. But here it is, the principles, a perfect leadership. You can go to DharmaCentral.com
[01:07:28.160 --> 01:07:33.600]  and find all his books are at Amazon.com, get the perfect principles, a perfect leadership.
[01:07:33.600 --> 01:07:41.680]  But I wanted to get him on because what really attracts me to Acharya is that he just has an
[01:07:41.680 --> 01:07:46.720]  incredible understanding of the world and how it really works. And I remember when I was getting
[01:07:46.720 --> 01:07:52.000]  divorced, eight and a half years ago, I had met my now wife, been married six years, but then
[01:07:52.000 --> 01:07:58.880]  girlfriend. And she said, you know, you sound like the Acharya G author and researcher that
[01:07:58.880 --> 01:08:05.120]  comes to Austin and give speeches. You know, you'd think at these, you know, big yoga facilities
[01:08:05.120 --> 01:08:09.440]  and studios and be real liberal. And a lot of it is, but this guy's the opposite. He has big crowds
[01:08:09.440 --> 01:08:14.080]  coming out to hearing. So I went and heard a two hour presentation. I thought, wow, I agree with
[01:08:14.080 --> 01:08:19.680]  all of that about the world. So I'm not here pushing any religious system. I'm here and
[01:08:19.680 --> 01:08:26.240]  neither is he. I'm just here saying it's important as Americans or as populist or as patriots
[01:08:26.240 --> 01:08:30.400]  to hear how other people around the world are thinking. Now he's from New York, but he's traveled
[01:08:30.400 --> 01:08:37.040]  the world in his very renowned and respected by the Hindu community and others in India
[01:08:37.040 --> 01:08:42.000]  and around the world. So he's definitely a heavy hitter, but quite frankly, he's the most articulate
[01:08:42.000 --> 01:08:47.280]  I found actually expressing what they really think politically. And there's, you know, close to
[01:08:47.280 --> 01:08:51.840]  what 900 million or so of these folks. So it's important. He correct me if I'm wrong, but it's
[01:08:51.840 --> 01:08:55.360]  a large, large group of people on the planet. It's important to know what their views are in
[01:08:55.360 --> 01:09:00.080]  the world and to know how the left is not really as popular as you think it is around the planet.
[01:09:00.080 --> 01:09:05.120]  So Acharya at Dharma central.com. I'm going to try to shut up here the next 45 minutes and give
[01:09:05.120 --> 01:09:10.800]  me the floor with just a few questions, but we've had dinner five or six times over the years. And
[01:09:10.800 --> 01:09:17.280]  I just, you know, your view and your understanding of the crisis we're in, what's coming, what we
[01:09:17.280 --> 01:09:23.280]  can do to stop it, what we can do to, to, I guess, survive through it is really important. So
[01:09:23.280 --> 01:09:26.640]  wherever you'd like to start, I'd like to talk about the new world order, the globalist, what
[01:09:26.640 --> 01:09:32.400]  they're trying to do versus what we're trying to do. Absolutely. Well, first of all, Alex, thank
[01:09:32.400 --> 01:09:36.480]  you very much for having me on. I truly appreciate it. And indeed, we've known each other for
[01:09:36.480 --> 01:09:42.400]  approximately eight years or so. And interestingly, at our first meeting, I told you how I've watched
[01:09:42.400 --> 01:09:47.840]  many, many, many of your shows for many years actually, you know, at least a decade before
[01:09:47.840 --> 01:09:53.120]  we even met or so. So I was very familiar with your work. And let me just say before we begin
[01:09:53.120 --> 01:10:00.320]  actually that you are indeed one of these unsung heroes of the war against totalitarianism,
[01:10:00.320 --> 01:10:05.280]  of the war against the deep state, the new world order, et cetera. And for that reason,
[01:10:05.280 --> 01:10:13.360]  I've always respected you. Now, as far as just my own background, my own understanding as far as,
[01:10:13.360 --> 01:10:18.400]  indeed, many of the issues that you discuss here on Info Wars, indeed, I've been very much aware
[01:10:18.400 --> 01:10:23.120]  of the situation of the world for, again, many decades, at least since the early 90s, if not
[01:10:23.120 --> 01:10:31.280]  a little bit before then, and how, indeed, there has been operative in the world today, a cabal
[01:10:31.280 --> 01:10:37.040]  that has been attempting to rule the world. Now, as far as how far back this cabal goes,
[01:10:37.040 --> 01:10:42.640]  well, various people will say various things. Really, in one way, it goes back thousands of
[01:10:42.640 --> 01:10:49.280]  years, certainly on a more functional operational level, it's been in existence since roughly the
[01:10:49.280 --> 01:10:57.040]  1600s. Because it was during that time, especially, that indeed, our world became, in a way, one world.
[01:10:57.040 --> 01:11:01.920]  You know, it's as a result of colonialism that began happening, oh, in the previous century to
[01:11:01.920 --> 01:11:08.880]  that, so roughly 15th century, 16th century, and then finally 17th century, that Europeans began
[01:11:08.880 --> 01:11:15.360]  colonizing, inhabiting the rest of the world. And indeed, for the first time in world history,
[01:11:15.360 --> 01:11:22.800]  you could say that the entire globe was connected. So, again, this project of true global domination
[01:11:22.800 --> 01:11:30.160]  began really roughly in the 1600s, early to mid 1600s. Indeed, some people even point to the exact
[01:11:30.160 --> 01:11:38.000]  year of 1666, actually, which is very interesting. And I, for one, also tend to agree that that's
[01:11:38.000 --> 01:11:44.720]  really the year that you can look at where this cabal became truly, truly powerful and had the
[01:11:44.720 --> 01:11:51.200]  mechanisms at their disposal, really for the first time, to at least in theory, but then
[01:11:51.200 --> 01:11:57.360]  practically, indeed, unite the world, quote unquote, but of course, as you like to say,
[01:11:57.360 --> 01:12:03.040]  as a prison planet. See, this is what's interesting, is that very well-meaning people,
[01:12:03.040 --> 01:12:08.000]  really, sometimes very well-meaning people who are very innocent, very naive, they really just
[01:12:08.000 --> 01:12:13.920]  don't know any better. We'll talk about global unity, one world, we want to have one world.
[01:12:14.560 --> 01:12:20.720]  And of course, what they have in mind is something radically different from what the actual globalists,
[01:12:20.720 --> 01:12:25.840]  this elitist cabal have in mind. When the innocent people talk about one world, well,
[01:12:25.840 --> 01:12:31.840]  what they think of are the various dispersed peoples of the world, kind of figuratively
[01:12:31.840 --> 01:12:37.600]  holding hands and singing together and getting along and there being global peace, etc. That's
[01:12:37.600 --> 01:12:43.440]  what the innocent people think of when they hear this term one world. However, when indeed these
[01:12:43.440 --> 01:12:50.320]  globalist elites talk about one world, oh, the vision that they have in mind is radically different
[01:12:50.320 --> 01:12:58.160]  and is dark and is evil. What their idea of one world is, is indeed a slave planet, ultimately.
[01:12:58.160 --> 01:13:04.800]  A world in which the vast, vast majority of individuals in the world are subservient,
[01:13:04.800 --> 01:13:11.440]  are controlled, are told what to do, do not have a voice of their own, do not have the ability to
[01:13:11.440 --> 01:13:19.760]  express who they are as unique and individual, in unique individuals and peoples, but rather,
[01:13:19.760 --> 01:13:27.280]  who are told from the top down what to do, who they are, etc. So indeed, this globalist
[01:13:27.280 --> 01:13:32.880]  elite, again, there are many names for them. Some people call them Illuminati New World Order.
[01:13:32.880 --> 01:13:39.200]  It doesn't matter what you call them. They are a reality. Their goal for the world and this idea
[01:13:39.200 --> 01:13:45.440]  of one world is something that is truly demonic. It's something that is truly evil.
[01:13:45.440 --> 01:13:49.440]  So indeed, this is a project that has been going on for a long time. We've seen that
[01:13:49.440 --> 01:13:55.200]  exponentially with the growth of technology throughout the world, with the growth of communication
[01:13:55.200 --> 01:14:04.640]  technology, especially that their grip on power has grown exponentially. And we have seen this
[01:14:04.640 --> 01:14:10.640]  especially in the last, oh, roughly 30 years or so with the explosion of the information age,
[01:14:10.640 --> 01:14:15.840]  with the explosion of, of course, computers, the internet, etc., with these handheld devices
[01:14:16.400 --> 01:14:23.840]  that people call smartphones that are an actuality tracking devices, etc. So what we have seen is
[01:14:23.840 --> 01:14:31.360]  that especially in the past roughly 30 years, the control that this evil elite has over the
[01:14:31.360 --> 01:14:38.720]  common individual has grown exponentially to the point where in one way of seeing this,
[01:14:38.720 --> 01:14:44.320]  they've almost achieved their goal, at least on the surface. They have achieved their goal of,
[01:14:44.320 --> 01:14:50.080]  indeed, quote unquote, uniting the planet, but again, in their demonic vision of what that means,
[01:14:50.080 --> 01:14:56.560]  but also having complete control over the populations of the world. Now, of course,
[01:14:56.560 --> 01:15:04.400]  this is surface level. And as you know, and as people who have followed my work also know,
[01:15:05.200 --> 01:15:12.160]  I tend to be extremely white-pilled as far as the future. So in other words, oh, I fully understand
[01:15:12.160 --> 01:15:16.640]  probably more than almost anyone on the planet, just how much these people are in control.
[01:15:16.640 --> 01:15:26.080]  They are in tremendous control. They have a truly evil end plan for us. This is true on the one hand.
[01:15:26.080 --> 01:15:35.360]  On the other hand, I am extremely positive about the absolute existential fact that these people,
[01:15:35.360 --> 01:15:42.400]  these evil individuals, these Luciferians on top, are going to be defeated and they're going to be
[01:15:42.400 --> 01:15:48.640]  defeated in our lifetime and decisively so. They're going to be defeated to the point where
[01:15:48.640 --> 01:15:54.320]  it will take them hundreds, if not thousands of years to recover. Evil never goes away. That's
[01:15:54.320 --> 01:15:58.560]  the nature of this world. That's the nature of the material world. That, of course, we have good,
[01:15:58.560 --> 01:16:05.200]  we have evil, happiness and suffering. It's a world of duality. So as of right now, the evil
[01:16:05.200 --> 01:16:11.600]  people seem to be on top. Well, that's going to change. It's not that evil itself will be eradicated.
[01:16:11.600 --> 01:16:17.920]  There will always be some evil people. As I like to say, even in a paradise once in a while,
[01:16:17.920 --> 01:16:23.920]  a fistfight will break out. There's no such thing as a perfect society. But at the same time,
[01:16:24.560 --> 01:16:30.400]  I truly believe that we are approaching a wonderful golden age and we see this all around us.
[01:16:31.200 --> 01:16:36.560]  It's interesting. When I was saying this one or two years ago, when the world seemed especially
[01:16:36.560 --> 01:16:42.480]  darker with COVID suddenly appearing on the scene, et cetera, et cetera, there are some people who
[01:16:42.480 --> 01:16:46.880]  were critical of me. Oh, how can you be so positive? Things are going terribly. Well,
[01:16:47.840 --> 01:16:54.240]  now that we've looked over the last several months and we have seen victory after victory,
[01:16:54.240 --> 01:17:00.800]  after victory of good people throughout the world, good leaders, both in elections, but then
[01:17:00.800 --> 01:17:05.360]  different instances that have been happening in the news that have woken people up.
[01:17:05.360 --> 01:17:09.760]  Now people don't doubt me anymore that we have a positive future to look forward to. Indeed,
[01:17:09.760 --> 01:17:15.200]  we have a golden age that we are going to experience in which this evil elite will be
[01:17:15.200 --> 01:17:21.120]  destroyed and good people will rise to the surface and will finally lead us. And indeed,
[01:17:21.120 --> 01:17:26.800]  that's why I wrote this book, Principles of Perfect Leadership, is precisely because this
[01:17:26.800 --> 01:17:31.600]  is what we've been missing. The reason why- And by the way, let me just interrupt you. I said I
[01:17:31.600 --> 01:17:37.520]  wouldn't interrupt a lot, but when I say that, in fact, we need to carry the book, when I say
[01:17:38.080 --> 01:17:43.680]  I learned a lot from this, you crystallize it very simply, but also beautifully. And I've
[01:17:43.680 --> 01:17:48.480]  experienced principles of leadership. I wasn't really taught them, but doing this 28 years,
[01:17:48.480 --> 01:17:54.000]  you learn how to be a leader. And it's just real truth that people aren't getting and how
[01:17:54.000 --> 01:17:58.400]  there is a crisis of leadership. And the average good person isn't looking for power.
[01:17:58.400 --> 01:18:03.600]  So we think of leadership as wanting power. No, if we don't become leaders and help people,
[01:18:03.600 --> 01:18:08.080]  evil is going to fill that gap in that vacuum. We have a responsibility and you explain that.
[01:18:08.080 --> 01:18:13.120]  So let's go through some of the principles of leadership. Yeah, absolutely. Well, first of all,
[01:18:13.120 --> 01:18:17.120]  Alex, let me tell you, you are an inherent leader. There are some individuals in this world
[01:18:17.120 --> 01:18:22.480]  who are just born to be good leaders and you're definitely one of them as is attested to by the
[01:18:22.480 --> 01:18:27.440]  fruits of your actions over many, many decades. And as far as leadership, yes, let's talk about
[01:18:27.440 --> 01:18:34.160]  this a little bit. This, what I'm about to talk about now goes into two things. First of all,
[01:18:34.160 --> 01:18:41.200]  part of the, let's say modus operandi of the evil individuals, but also addresses some of
[01:18:41.200 --> 01:18:47.840]  the crisis that we're experiencing today. And that is that indeed, we have been lacking good
[01:18:47.840 --> 01:18:54.720]  leaders, real leaders in society for a very long time. So at least several generations,
[01:18:54.720 --> 01:19:01.600]  I would say. Now, why is this the case? Well, because as evil as this evil cabal is,
[01:19:02.320 --> 01:19:08.320]  they're also extremely intelligent. They are incredibly intelligent in an evil way,
[01:19:08.320 --> 01:19:13.840]  of course, in a conniving way, in a manipulative way. But one thing that they understood is that
[01:19:13.840 --> 01:19:19.200]  if you are going to conquer a people, the first thing that you do is you eradicate their leaders.
[01:19:19.200 --> 01:19:25.440]  So this is something that very quietly they have indeed done for, again, generations and generations.
[01:19:25.440 --> 01:19:32.800]  We don't have to go over the list of individuals who were very proficient leaders in the 50s,
[01:19:32.800 --> 01:19:38.160]  in the 60s, in the 70s and on and on, who were assassinated, who were suppressed in one way
[01:19:38.160 --> 01:19:44.800]  or another. Indeed, one could say that even today, in 2022 and for the last several years,
[01:19:44.800 --> 01:19:52.000]  they have been, let's say verbally assassinating our leaders by censoring them. This is why some
[01:19:52.000 --> 01:19:58.640]  of the very best voices, most of the very best voices that were available five, six years ago
[01:19:58.640 --> 01:20:04.000]  on all of the social media platforms, they're gone. They've been eradicated. They've been in a way
[01:20:04.000 --> 01:20:10.000]  through censorship assassinated. So this is the first thing that they understood, is they are
[01:20:10.000 --> 01:20:15.520]  to deprive what they perceive as their enemies of their leadership. Now, as a result of this,
[01:20:15.520 --> 01:20:22.160]  indeed, we have not had good leadership. We've had terrible leadership. This is true in every field.
[01:20:22.160 --> 01:20:27.520]  This is true in religion, and I'm a religious leader, but I can say honestly, oh, when I look
[01:20:27.520 --> 01:20:32.240]  around me and I look at individuals who claim to be religious leaders, they're corrupt. They are
[01:20:32.240 --> 01:20:38.000]  corrupt, many of them. This is true in culture, in so-called entertainment. Look at Hollywood,
[01:20:38.000 --> 01:20:44.640]  look at Hollywood. Individuals who are supposed to be cultural leaders are just vacuous creatures
[01:20:44.640 --> 01:20:49.920]  who just are slaves of their masters and just propagate what they're told to say, et cetera.
[01:20:49.920 --> 01:20:57.280]  They're not leaders, they're repeaters. Exactly, exactly. We don't have artists anymore,
[01:20:57.280 --> 01:21:03.840]  musical artists, visual artists. Well, we have our entertainers. And then of course, oh, let's get
[01:21:03.840 --> 01:21:11.760]  into politics. We have been suffering from corrupt leadership for, again, generations.
[01:21:11.760 --> 01:21:17.200]  This is not something that goes back, oh, just 10, 20, 30 years. This is something that goes back
[01:21:17.200 --> 01:21:22.880]  generations where we have individuals who claim to represent the people, who claim,
[01:21:22.880 --> 01:21:29.520]  as all politicians do, oh, I'm honest, I'm clean, I just want to do what is the best for my constituency
[01:21:29.520 --> 01:21:35.280]  and they're all corrupt. And when I say all, of course, in every field, there are always exceptions
[01:21:35.280 --> 01:21:40.880]  and thank God for those exceptions. Even in politics, there are some good politicians who are there.
[01:21:40.880 --> 01:21:44.880]  And indeed, maybe later we can talk a little bit about this, how there are good people who are
[01:21:44.880 --> 01:21:51.360]  finally arising and have for the last several years. But this is the point, is that, A, we have
[01:21:51.360 --> 01:21:57.200]  been deprived of good leaders as a result that people have suffered. Because I'm very blunt
[01:21:57.200 --> 01:22:04.880]  in saying this. I'm not someone who menses words. The way that you change society is from the top
[01:22:04.880 --> 01:22:10.960]  down. It's from the top down. In other words, you can have the well-meaning people, which we do.
[01:22:10.960 --> 01:22:16.240]  The vast majority of individuals, they know what needs to be done. They know the difference
[01:22:16.240 --> 01:22:24.240]  between right and wrong, et cetera. But without someone to rally them, the people, and lead them,
[01:22:24.240 --> 01:22:29.440]  there's nothing that the people can do in the face of this evil cabal. So indeed, this is what
[01:22:29.440 --> 01:22:35.520]  has been missing. Now, very quickly to talk about what we have been missing in leaders,
[01:22:36.320 --> 01:22:40.080]  several things. And indeed, I can talk about this endlessly. I wrote a whole book about it.
[01:22:40.080 --> 01:22:44.160]  But let me just talk about three principles that have been missing from leaders.
[01:22:44.800 --> 01:22:51.760]  First and foremost, a leader is an individual who is the personification of the very spirit
[01:22:51.760 --> 01:22:59.040]  of their people. In other words, a true leader has to absolutely represent their people. And again,
[01:22:59.040 --> 01:23:03.520]  I talk about this bluntly in the book. They can't be a globalist. They can't claim,
[01:23:03.520 --> 01:23:09.120]  old people are my people. I represent the entire planet. I represent all sentient beings. No,
[01:23:09.120 --> 01:23:15.200]  you represent your people. Your people, whether that's the nation, an ethnos, a community, a
[01:23:15.200 --> 01:23:19.920]  neighborhood, et cetera. You represent your people and your people exclusively. That's
[01:23:19.920 --> 01:23:25.920]  what your people desire of you. And that's what they expect of you. So you're an American politician.
[01:23:25.920 --> 01:23:29.760]  You must represent the American people, not the people of the globe.
[01:23:30.400 --> 01:23:36.160]  You are a British politician. You must represent the indigenous British population,
[01:23:36.160 --> 01:23:40.720]  not the people of the globe and on and on and on like this. So that's the first thing,
[01:23:40.720 --> 01:23:45.600]  is that a true leader truly represents the very spirit, the very essence of their people.
[01:23:45.600 --> 01:23:55.600]  The second thing is that a true leader must be thoroughly incorruptible. And indeed,
[01:23:55.600 --> 01:24:01.360]  this is why I called the book, Principles of Perfect Leadership. It's interesting. It's a bold
[01:24:01.360 --> 01:24:09.200]  title, not principles of good leadership, really wonderful. No, perfect leadership. We are to expect
[01:24:09.200 --> 01:24:14.800]  that if an individual claims, I am a leader, you better be perfect. And let me explain what I mean
[01:24:14.800 --> 01:24:20.480]  by perfect. It doesn't mean that, oh, you don't trip over your shoes once in a while. It doesn't
[01:24:20.480 --> 01:24:26.400]  mean that if someone asks you, oh, what's the capital of the state of North Dakota? Oh, you can't
[01:24:26.400 --> 01:24:32.160]  remember it. This is not what we mean by perfect. What we mean by perfect is that you are incorruptible.
[01:24:32.160 --> 01:24:38.960]  That is, once you have acquired power, you don't let it go to your head. At no point if you are a
[01:24:38.960 --> 01:24:45.840]  leader of your people, do you then, once you have power, do you then use that power selfishly only
[01:24:45.840 --> 01:24:52.800]  for yourself and your immediate loved ones? No. Once you have power, whether it's on a school
[01:24:52.800 --> 01:24:57.840]  board, whether it's as a mayor, as a governor, whether it's as president of the United States,
[01:24:57.840 --> 01:25:04.240]  whether it's as prime minister of X nation, once you have that power, the only thing in your mind
[01:25:04.240 --> 01:25:12.240]  is how, as a leader of my people, can I give all of who I am to benefit my people? That's what I mean
[01:25:12.240 --> 01:25:16.480]  by incorruptible. And now the last thing I want to say is, expanding on that, it makes sense. You're
[01:25:16.480 --> 01:25:21.600]  saying you're not a perfect person. You don't make mistakes. Obviously, you do make mistakes, but
[01:25:21.600 --> 01:25:27.760]  you were executing principles and not compromising on those. And that is the perfection, is the
[01:25:27.760 --> 01:25:34.240]  commitment to doing what's right. Exactly. Exactly. Right. So what's meant by perfect is, yes, not
[01:25:34.240 --> 01:25:38.640]  that you, you know, you don't get a math equation wrong once, well, that, no, that's, that's petty,
[01:25:38.640 --> 01:25:43.520]  that's silly. What we mean by a perfect leader is that indeed, you represent your people perfectly.
[01:25:43.520 --> 01:25:47.280]  Sure. And you might get deceived sometimes with information, and then you admit when you were
[01:25:47.280 --> 01:25:51.840]  wrong, but you're perfect in your heart, trying to do the best job you can on those principles.
[01:25:51.840 --> 01:25:57.520]  Sure. Absolutely. Perfect as finite beings in the face of God. So in other words,
[01:25:57.520 --> 01:26:02.560]  yeah, you know, we're, we're finite beings, you know, we're children of God. What that means is that,
[01:26:02.560 --> 01:26:08.320]  of course, we are imperfect, you know, we're not God, we can't, you know, just walk in perfection
[01:26:08.320 --> 01:26:14.880]  24 hours a day. But at the same time, when it comes to our job as leaders to represent our people,
[01:26:14.880 --> 01:26:21.920]  oh, we do that perfectly, meaning at the very least, we are incorruptible. We truly give of
[01:26:21.920 --> 01:26:29.760]  ourselves honestly to serve our people. And let me just say this one last quality, and it's not
[01:26:29.760 --> 01:26:33.520]  really the last, it's the last. No, no, no, no, take your time. And we'll have you back again.
[01:26:33.520 --> 01:26:37.600]  I'm taking these people need to think about this. And they have to realize you're a leader of a
[01:26:37.600 --> 01:26:41.600]  family, you're a leader of a business, you're a leader as a manager, you're a, you know, a leader
[01:26:41.600 --> 01:26:47.600]  of the garden you're planning. It's realizing the office that God has given you as dominion,
[01:26:47.600 --> 01:26:54.400]  but, but, but you've got to execute it. Right. Exactly. Exactly. And yes, let me just, let me
[01:26:54.400 --> 01:27:01.360]  just say this, there are many, many, many principles of good and perfect leadership. But the last
[01:27:01.360 --> 01:27:07.840]  one I want to talk about for now, which is actually extremely important, a true leader,
[01:27:07.840 --> 01:27:13.760]  a perfect leader, an individual who can claim to be a leader of their people, must, and without
[01:27:13.760 --> 01:27:18.720]  exception, be a spiritual person. In other words, they must be an individual who is surrendered
[01:27:18.720 --> 01:27:24.080]  to God. And not just for political purposes, not just, oh, well, my people are religious,
[01:27:24.080 --> 01:27:28.160]  so I guess it looks good. I'll go to church once in a while to pretend I'm religious. No.
[01:27:28.960 --> 01:27:34.880]  An individual who is a leader has to have a spiritual life in their private life. That
[01:27:34.880 --> 01:27:40.240]  means that they must pray to God daily. That means they must be dependent upon God. That
[01:27:40.240 --> 01:27:46.160]  means they must meditate. They must read scriptures, et cetera, et cetera. They must be an individual
[01:27:46.160 --> 01:27:55.600]  who they see their role as a leader, as their personal service toward God. They see themselves
[01:27:55.600 --> 01:28:00.720]  as a servant of God and of the people. In fact, you know, I've talked about this. There's an
[01:28:00.720 --> 01:28:05.600]  interesting bumper sticker that I saw many years ago that states it perfectly. And that is,
[01:28:05.600 --> 01:28:13.760]  God first, you second, me third. That is how the leader lives his life. That first and foremost,
[01:28:13.760 --> 01:28:20.960]  he sees his role as a leader as his service, his personal service toward God. Second, he sees
[01:28:20.960 --> 01:28:26.240]  his role as a leader as his service toward his people. And again, yes, in whatever strata that
[01:28:26.240 --> 01:28:31.280]  is, of course, we're talking, at least I am in a very high sense, or a president or someone like
[01:28:31.280 --> 01:28:37.280]  this. But you also, you also talk in the book, and it's totally true, you must revere your ancestors
[01:28:37.280 --> 01:28:41.680]  and know your culture. Doesn't mean you don't like other cultures, but as a leader, you represent
[01:28:41.680 --> 01:28:46.480]  and respect those that brought you to where you are, because this evil force wants to erase that
[01:28:46.480 --> 01:28:51.040]  to program you with its anti-human force. So it doesn't mean we don't all work together,
[01:28:51.040 --> 01:28:56.480]  work together, but through leaders and through the masses, through agreements that we make
[01:28:56.480 --> 01:29:03.440]  collectively as a species. But if we give up our ancestors and all of that genetic knowledge,
[01:29:03.440 --> 01:29:08.160]  that's not something God wants. And that is so key is I don't pray to my ancestors, but
[01:29:08.160 --> 01:29:14.320]  I pray to God, and then I feel my ancestor strength and everything they learn, then that opens the
[01:29:14.320 --> 01:29:21.680]  gate. And God literally, I call it knowledge or discernment or weapon systems are then unlocked.
[01:29:23.760 --> 01:29:29.040]  Absolutely. Yeah, this is definitely a very, very important aspect of what it means to be a whole
[01:29:29.040 --> 01:29:34.320]  person that we've lost sight of. And we've lost sight of it, of course, because like with many
[01:29:34.320 --> 01:29:39.680]  other traditional values, it's been taken away from us again from this cabal. And you talk about
[01:29:39.680 --> 01:29:44.000]  that they're waging war on tradition because tradition is powerful. And notice almost all
[01:29:44.000 --> 01:29:47.120]  traditions are the same around the world. It's because it's what it's who we are.
[01:29:48.800 --> 01:29:53.680]  Yes, absolutely. Yeah, it's interesting. You know, in fact, yeah, just to touch on that for a
[01:29:53.680 --> 01:30:00.160]  moment before I go back and talk about ancestors, it is interesting how when you indeed research
[01:30:00.160 --> 01:30:05.200]  the world, which I have, you know, I've got a PhD in languages and cultures of Asia and religious
[01:30:05.200 --> 01:30:10.560]  studies. And it's interesting when you look at the various ancient traditions of the world,
[01:30:10.560 --> 01:30:15.760]  they have more in common than they have dividing them, you know, the core principles, ethical,
[01:30:16.640 --> 01:30:21.280]  religious. Well, you've written about the Hindus are very similar in many ways to the Vikings.
[01:30:21.280 --> 01:30:28.800]  I mean, it's all amazing. Yeah, it is. Oh, that alone is something we could talk about for an
[01:30:28.800 --> 01:30:35.600]  hour. Yeah, it's very interesting. Traditional Hindu principles are principles that actually any
[01:30:35.600 --> 01:30:40.960]  European, whether whether Christian or otherwise, would absolutely relate to completely, they would
[01:30:40.960 --> 01:30:45.520]  understand and relate to. But it's interesting that again, when you look at the various cultures
[01:30:45.520 --> 01:30:51.600]  of the world, they share common, many common principles. And this is one of them, the idea
[01:30:51.600 --> 01:30:58.080]  that we are to, to understand, to honor, to revere, to respect and to follow in the footsteps
[01:30:58.080 --> 01:31:03.280]  of our ancestors of those who came before us. Indeed, this was understood in the Western world,
[01:31:03.280 --> 01:31:09.360]  this was understood in America, up until 50 years ago, or something like that, where people knew
[01:31:09.360 --> 01:31:13.920]  their history, they knew the history of their family, they knew the history of their, their
[01:31:13.920 --> 01:31:20.640]  surroundings of their people, etc. Well, like so many other, let's say, traditional norms that
[01:31:20.640 --> 01:31:26.400]  were artificially taken away from us by this evil cabal, this is one of the most powerful ones that
[01:31:26.400 --> 01:31:32.800]  was taken away from us. And that is taking shelter of our past, learning from our ancestors, revering
[01:31:32.800 --> 01:31:39.040]  and honoring them, etc. And indeed, this is something that the power of which was understood
[01:31:39.040 --> 01:31:43.360]  again by, by all people in the past. Can you briefly speak to that because, because
[01:31:44.160 --> 01:31:48.640]  literally when I think about my ancestors and learn about them and who they were, it empowers me,
[01:31:48.640 --> 01:31:54.240]  but it's more than just psychologically, it opens some type of gate to a discernment and
[01:31:54.240 --> 01:31:58.880]  strength and you literally then know it's not just a feeling, you know your ancestors are there with
[01:31:58.880 --> 01:32:06.160]  you. Yes, and it is because they are with us. They're living through us right now. That's the
[01:32:06.160 --> 01:32:10.560]  thing that's that is interesting that we of course always forget because we've been made to forget.
[01:32:11.120 --> 01:32:18.320]  Everything that we are now, for the most part, everything that we are now is a direct result
[01:32:18.320 --> 01:32:24.560]  of the sacrifices of those who came before us and specifically genetically our ancestors, literally
[01:32:24.560 --> 01:32:29.680]  our parents, their parents, their parents stretching all the way back to the beginning of time.
[01:32:29.680 --> 01:32:37.200]  Everything that we are, even how we look, how we think, our cultural norms, etc. is the result
[01:32:37.200 --> 01:32:44.240]  of all the sacrifices, all the creativity, all the wondrous experiences that these people had.
[01:32:44.240 --> 01:32:48.320]  So it's an ocean, it's an ocean of wealth and creativity and connection to God.
[01:32:48.320 --> 01:32:56.080]  Yes, absolutely. Because they're not God, but their powerful connections are electrochemical.
[01:32:56.080 --> 01:33:00.880]  Because think about it, I am genetically like a power going down a power line,
[01:33:00.880 --> 01:33:04.560]  connected to the most ancient ancestor, however long we believe that goes back or where that came
[01:33:04.560 --> 01:33:11.360]  from, that each person had children that were grown electrochemically inside a body and passed on.
[01:33:11.360 --> 01:33:18.640]  It's a continual chain, it's incredibly, it's a stream or a waterfall, it's powerful.
[01:33:19.280 --> 01:33:25.840]  Yeah, absolutely. Yeah, you described it very, very, very well actually. And this is the thing
[01:33:25.840 --> 01:33:35.040]  that is wonderful practically about this, is that we have the ability even now to access the wisdom
[01:33:35.040 --> 01:33:41.680]  and the strength of our ancestors. And indeed, again, this has been one of the mechanisms of
[01:33:41.680 --> 01:33:48.000]  these evil people, is that they have disconnected us from our ancestors, so thus disconnected us
[01:33:48.000 --> 01:33:54.400]  from that ancient wisdom, that ancient strength, that ancient perseverance that was there in,
[01:33:54.400 --> 01:34:01.120]  again, our great grandparents, their grandparents, their grandparents. We have the ability to access
[01:34:01.120 --> 01:34:07.760]  that strength of our ancestors in the here and now. All we have to do is consciously acknowledge
[01:34:07.760 --> 01:34:12.800]  that. Most people don't. And the globalists are trying to hijack that, cut in, sabotage it,
[01:34:12.800 --> 01:34:19.280]  and create a new biomechanical cyborg system. Can you speak to what they'd like to do to us
[01:34:19.280 --> 01:34:27.600]  if they're successful, Acharya? Oh, yes, I can. Yes, I can. It's horrific, actually, what their
[01:34:27.600 --> 01:34:35.840]  actual end goal is. And indeed, many people have some ideas about what their ultimate end goal is.
[01:34:35.840 --> 01:34:42.000]  And I usually tell people, whatever is the worst that you can think, it's probably worse than that,
[01:34:42.000 --> 01:34:46.800]  actually. Their goal, first to just state it generally, but then I'll go into specifics.
[01:34:47.680 --> 01:34:52.720]  Their goal, as I said before, is indeed to create a slave planet. Their goal is indeed to create a
[01:34:52.720 --> 01:34:59.120]  two-tiered system, similar to the feudal system of the past, oppressive feudal systems, where the
[01:34:59.120 --> 01:35:04.800]  idea is that you have a tiny minority of individuals who are the overlords, who are the
[01:35:04.800 --> 01:35:09.520]  privileged ones, who are the people who truly control everything. They control information.
[01:35:09.520 --> 01:35:17.520]  They control what we do, where we are, etc. They control the food supply, etc. Those are the tiny
[01:35:17.520 --> 01:35:22.720]  minority on top, which, of course, they're hoping will be them. And then there is the majority of
[01:35:22.720 --> 01:35:28.320]  the rest of the planet that will be subservient to these people, and will be living quite literally
[01:35:28.320 --> 01:35:32.880]  as slaves. Now, they're smart enough. They know marketing very well. Of course, we won't be called
[01:35:32.880 --> 01:35:37.840]  slaves. We'll be called whatever they want, citizens of the planet. But the truth of the
[01:35:37.840 --> 01:35:44.640]  matter is that we will be living hellish lives. And indeed, when you listen to such institutions
[01:35:44.640 --> 01:35:51.440]  as the World Economic Forum and Davos and all these various globalist organizations and institutions,
[01:35:52.000 --> 01:35:57.520]  they give us very, very clear hints of what they want for us. They want the vast majority of
[01:35:57.520 --> 01:36:05.360]  individuals, first of all, to be living in mega cities, the largest cities of which exist today
[01:36:05.360 --> 01:36:12.000]  will seem puny in comparison. They ultimately want the entire world to consist of a small number of
[01:36:12.000 --> 01:36:18.240]  cities of, oh, roughly 100 million people each, in which people will be living like sardines,
[01:36:18.240 --> 01:36:24.320]  will be living in little pods. They've told us this, will be eating bugs, whereas they eat all
[01:36:24.320 --> 01:36:30.480]  the richest, most nutritious foods on earth, the most delicious foods on earth. We will be wage
[01:36:30.480 --> 01:36:38.880]  slaves, we'll be working constantly, etc., etc. As far as religion, well, they're in the process,
[01:36:38.880 --> 01:36:45.840]  they have been for a long time, of creating a global, fraudulent religion for us. And that will
[01:36:45.840 --> 01:36:52.320]  be our only expression of spirituality that will be available to us, etc., etc. So yes, this is the
[01:36:52.320 --> 01:36:58.400]  ultimate goal. Now, as far as how to reach that goal, how to get from where we are now to what the
[01:36:58.400 --> 01:37:05.200]  goal of this evil cabal is, that's where the horror is. And indeed, you know, many people
[01:37:05.200 --> 01:37:10.160]  who have appeared on your show, you yourself have spoken about this. Yes, they want to call the planet.
[01:37:10.960 --> 01:37:15.280]  They want to eliminate the vast majority of what they call the useless eaters.
[01:37:15.280 --> 01:37:19.200]  They want to get rid of the vast majority of individuals, because if you have
[01:37:19.200 --> 01:37:25.280]  a smaller population, they're easier to control. And as far as how they're doing this, well, again,
[01:37:25.280 --> 01:37:31.200]  we have very, very clear indications for how they desire to call the planet. You know, they want
[01:37:31.200 --> 01:37:37.360]  hundreds of millions, really several billion people to just die, as far as what that timeline looks
[01:37:37.360 --> 01:37:42.480]  like. But it has to be something realistic. It can't just happen overnight. But on the other hand,
[01:37:42.480 --> 01:37:48.800]  their goal is to have this happen as soon as possible, etc. And indeed, their goal for us is
[01:37:48.800 --> 01:37:55.040]  even physically to be smaller. Their goal for us is to be unhealthy. Their goal for us is to be
[01:37:55.040 --> 01:38:02.320]  ultimately a low IQ population, rather than having a three digit IQ, their goal for us is to have an
[01:38:02.320 --> 01:38:08.720]  IQ of roughly 60 to 70, something like that, so that we can think well enough to maybe operate
[01:38:08.720 --> 01:38:15.600]  machinery, let's say in a factory, but we can't think with the philosophical acumen that's necessary
[01:38:15.600 --> 01:38:21.280]  to then question, what is my life about? Why am I doing this? You know, so they want to keep us
[01:38:21.280 --> 01:38:26.160]  at just that level of intelligence that we can serve them. And let's explain. They could have
[01:38:26.160 --> 01:38:30.240]  robots that did it, but they want to mount our head on the wall metaphysically. They want to
[01:38:30.240 --> 01:38:35.840]  capture the human species and our development and enslave it like a cat playing with a mouse.
[01:38:35.840 --> 01:38:41.600]  This is their religion, which I find very, very alien. I don't get into flying saucers and things
[01:38:41.600 --> 01:38:46.960]  like that. I just look and extrapolate it out logically with what's being done to humanity
[01:38:46.960 --> 01:38:52.000]  and how the leaders are going against humanity and waging war against what's good and dumbing us
[01:38:52.000 --> 01:38:57.520]  down. And then you've all Harari, you mentioned him at the Debo script saying, we're going to be gods,
[01:38:57.520 --> 01:39:02.320]  we're going to get rid of humans, all this. They sound like an invading alien force. I mean, they
[01:39:04.000 --> 01:39:10.320]  sound like our enemy. Yes. Yeah, as far as Harari, I consider him to be a fourth rate
[01:39:10.320 --> 01:39:17.040]  philosopher. Personally, he's a fourth rate thinker. But in any case, yes, yes, it's, it's
[01:39:17.040 --> 01:39:21.920]  absolutely, he just puppets what they tell him to say. But what he says is really what they want
[01:39:21.920 --> 01:39:26.960]  to do to us. So that's the next question. Why do these evil people, these anti God people, these
[01:39:26.960 --> 01:39:31.680]  anti human people, why do they always have to tell you what they're doing to you? Because they'll
[01:39:31.680 --> 01:39:35.280]  tell you, we're setting up world government, getting rid of the family, doing all this.
[01:39:35.280 --> 01:39:38.720]  But then they'll say, Oh, but we want to save you and we love you and we're great.
[01:39:38.720 --> 01:39:44.560]  And they'll attack people that read their own writings on air saying we're conspiracy theorists,
[01:39:44.560 --> 01:39:46.800]  though we're just playing exact clips of what they said.
[01:39:48.560 --> 01:39:54.240]  Yeah, exactly. This, this interestingly is, is part of their religion. And this gets to the,
[01:39:54.240 --> 01:40:00.720]  let's say, more metaphysical slash spiritual aspect of this current war that's going on.
[01:40:00.720 --> 01:40:06.000]  You have very intelligently called it an info war, information war. It certainly is that,
[01:40:06.000 --> 01:40:12.240]  but more than anything, it's a spiritual war. These evil elites indeed have their own religion.
[01:40:12.800 --> 01:40:17.040]  And this is something that's easy to research. Again, like you said, you just have to look at
[01:40:17.040 --> 01:40:22.560]  their own writings, their own actions, the things that they themselves say, these people generally
[01:40:22.560 --> 01:40:27.360]  speaking for to use a generic term, these people are Luciferian, they have their own religion,
[01:40:27.360 --> 01:40:32.720]  they have their own quote unquote spiritual religious principles. One of these is indeed
[01:40:32.720 --> 01:40:40.400]  this principle that in order to accomplish the evil that they wish to do in the way that in
[01:40:40.400 --> 01:40:46.320]  their own mind is quote unquote ethical, they have this idea that well, at least before they
[01:40:46.320 --> 01:40:51.840]  destroy you, they're going to give you a little warning. And it's not much of a warning. It's a
[01:40:51.840 --> 01:40:56.880]  warning that again, only a minority of individuals pick up on, but at least they can say in their
[01:40:56.880 --> 01:41:02.000]  mind, well, but we did warn you before we do X thing, we did give you a little hint that we
[01:41:02.000 --> 01:41:07.360]  were going to do a next thing. So you can't claim that we are unethical. So this is how their mind
[01:41:07.360 --> 01:41:13.120]  operates. Indeed, the way that I've described the religion of the elite, again, this Luciferian
[01:41:13.120 --> 01:41:17.840]  sort of religion, and actually goes deeper than just Luciferianism. That's just a generic term
[01:41:17.840 --> 01:41:25.680]  for their worldview. The way that I've described this is that if you can envision actual religion,
[01:41:25.680 --> 01:41:33.040]  that is healthy whole religion that has goodness and God in the center, if you can imagine that
[01:41:33.680 --> 01:41:40.480]  turned upside down. So an inversion of reality and inversion of the spiritual and inversion of
[01:41:40.480 --> 01:41:46.480]  religion. This is what these people believe and this is what they truly practice. So indeed,
[01:41:46.480 --> 01:41:51.360]  you know, just like religious people, real religious people have religious rituals,
[01:41:51.360 --> 01:41:57.280]  well, these people have their rituals, but they're turned upside down, rather than sacraments that
[01:41:57.280 --> 01:42:02.480]  are, again, whole and sacred and good. These evil people, their sacrament is blood,
[01:42:03.280 --> 01:42:08.560]  their sacrament is pain, et cetera, et cetera. And oh, we can go on and on about this for a very
[01:42:08.560 --> 01:42:15.600]  long time. But essentially, these people have attempted to turn reality upside down. You see
[01:42:15.600 --> 01:42:22.320]  this also culturally. And what is happening even culturally is an extension of this inversion
[01:42:22.320 --> 01:42:29.680]  that they practice where good is bad, bad is good, et cetera. So now we are, and when I say we,
[01:42:29.680 --> 01:42:37.120]  I don't mean you and I obviously, but the culture supposedly is celebrating grooming and pedophilia,
[01:42:37.120 --> 01:42:42.480]  et cetera. Well, these are things that good people know are evil, evil, evil. And yet,
[01:42:42.480 --> 01:42:47.600]  these people are pushing this in the form of, you know, drag queen story hour, et cetera. And
[01:42:47.600 --> 01:42:52.880]  oh, yes, let's normalize this, not only in society, but this is how evil these individuals are and
[01:42:52.880 --> 01:43:00.560]  how they think, not just in society, but among the children. You see, this is how we know that
[01:43:00.560 --> 01:43:07.040]  these globalists are truly evil individuals, is that it's not enough that they want to go after
[01:43:07.040 --> 01:43:13.920]  all of the adults in the world. Explain this, this is key. That's a red line even for these
[01:43:13.920 --> 01:43:18.400]  Luciferians. Normally, like you were saying earlier, just like legally, people post a notice
[01:43:18.400 --> 01:43:22.400]  in the newspaper, they're going to seize your house. Now, obviously, you're not going to read
[01:43:22.400 --> 01:43:26.080]  that little footnote in the newspaper, but they can say, Hey, we told you it's your fault, you
[01:43:26.080 --> 01:43:31.600]  didn't know. But to go after children who we know can't make decisions, can't join the military,
[01:43:31.600 --> 01:43:35.920]  can't buy liquor, can't buy cigarettes, but 10 year olds can have their breasts through penises
[01:43:35.920 --> 01:43:44.400]  cut off to actually do that is crossing a Rubicon. Yes, it is, it is, it is. And interestingly,
[01:43:44.400 --> 01:43:51.120]  however, for people who are, let's say somewhat new to discovering all this, you know, the fact
[01:43:51.120 --> 01:43:55.600]  that these people are going after our children, that they seem to have some overall goal that
[01:43:55.600 --> 01:44:02.000]  they're going after, etc. For people who are somewhat new to this knowledge, it's important
[01:44:02.000 --> 01:44:08.000]  to understand that this has been one of their goals from the very beginning. And the reason why
[01:44:08.000 --> 01:44:15.360]  is because again, religiously speaking, because they invert religious reality for the for good
[01:44:15.360 --> 01:44:22.560]  people, we honor and love and respect and cherish innocence. But with the evil cabal,
[01:44:23.440 --> 01:44:30.880]  they hate innocence. They see innocence as their enemy. And who represents innocence more than
[01:44:30.880 --> 01:44:36.880]  anyone in society, it's the children. So this is why it's not surprising really for those of us
[01:44:36.880 --> 01:44:41.440]  who have known about this for decades. It's not surprising that they're going after our children.
[01:44:41.440 --> 01:44:46.080]  It's because they see innocence as their very enemy. And that being the case, that's why they're
[01:44:46.080 --> 01:44:52.960]  going after the children, they want to deprive children of their innocence. And it's the word
[01:44:52.960 --> 01:44:58.880]  demonic is not strong enough for these individuals. Is the attack on children as Muhammad Gandhi said,
[01:44:58.880 --> 01:45:03.760]  you know, in each seat of a child to see the universe, the attack on free will trying to
[01:45:03.760 --> 01:45:09.920]  destroy children, which even the most evil people in history leave alone. That is a satanic act,
[01:45:09.920 --> 01:45:15.360]  really trying to see to get God to turn his back on the world and turn us over to evil.
[01:45:15.360 --> 01:45:20.960]  Because if they know, even if we're not involved in the children, if we don't stop them,
[01:45:20.960 --> 01:45:26.480]  it then falls on us. And that is an overall ritual to have the whole world fall to a lower
[01:45:26.480 --> 01:45:34.320]  dimension. Yeah, absolutely. You know, you see in the New Testament how Jesus says something to
[01:45:34.320 --> 01:45:40.080]  the effect of all let the children come unto me, you know, so embracing the innocence of children
[01:45:40.080 --> 01:45:44.720]  and loving children for who they are, because of the fact that they're just and the next verse,
[01:45:44.720 --> 01:45:49.520]  he says, hurting one of them, it's better you tie a giant boulder on your neck and drown yourself
[01:45:49.520 --> 01:45:56.800]  in the hurt one of these. Yeah, exactly. And here we have the these Luciferian elitists,
[01:45:56.800 --> 01:46:01.440]  of course, practicing the very opposite, that yes, this is what they want to do. They want to
[01:46:01.440 --> 01:46:07.120]  they want to harm the children. So yeah, it's something absolutely, absolutely hard horrifying.
[01:46:07.120 --> 01:46:12.400]  But more, you said it correctly before, this is the Rubicon, this is the turning point at this
[01:46:12.400 --> 01:46:19.120]  point. This is this is the good outcome of what these evil people are doing. Is that now people
[01:46:19.120 --> 01:46:27.360]  is eyes are opening. People can't pretend to just to just not know anything anymore. People are
[01:46:27.360 --> 01:46:33.120]  awakening now throughout the planet that oh my God, what is this? It was one thing when they were
[01:46:33.920 --> 01:46:40.000]  trying to pervert culture in general. Now they're coming after our children. Now as a result, we
[01:46:40.000 --> 01:46:45.200]  see millions of people like at no other time, waking up and fighting back. And of course,
[01:46:45.200 --> 01:46:52.000]  non violently, we mean verbally, politically, socially, culturally, etc. People are now fighting
[01:46:52.000 --> 01:46:58.560]  back against this evil elite, this evil cabal. And this is the thing that's amazing is that this
[01:46:58.560 --> 01:47:05.440]  evil cabal is panicking right now. They're not accustomed to what they call the cattle that
[01:47:05.440 --> 01:47:10.960]  is all of us. They're not accustomed to the cattle fighting back and actually seeing them for who
[01:47:10.960 --> 01:47:18.080]  and what they are. Now we are waking up. The people are opening their eyes. They're saying oh my God,
[01:47:18.080 --> 01:47:23.360]  what are these people trying to do to our children? And the people are fighting back,
[01:47:23.360 --> 01:47:29.280]  they're pushing back against even the highest echelons of these evil people. And Alex, let me
[01:47:29.280 --> 01:47:38.400]  tell you, these evil people who are trying to harm us, they're panicking. And this has not happened
[01:47:38.400 --> 01:47:43.600]  to before. This is why this is a turning point, this era that we're in right now. And this is why
[01:47:43.600 --> 01:47:49.600]  I tell people, this is why I'm known to be again, white-pilled, very positive. We're going to win
[01:47:49.600 --> 01:47:55.040]  because we've never seen an era like this, the latter part of 2022, when again, millions of
[01:47:55.040 --> 01:47:59.360]  eyes are being opened to the agenda. And people are waking up to the poison shots. They're waking
[01:47:59.360 --> 01:48:03.280]  up everywhere. I know some liberals, the attack on children is too far for them. And there are
[01:48:03.280 --> 01:48:06.640]  people that say, well, why would the global squad for children when it's going to defeat them?
[01:48:06.640 --> 01:48:11.520]  This satanic force must have the innocence and can't help itself. It's like a pedophile can
[01:48:11.520 --> 01:48:16.400]  help themselves. It's the same spirit. We should quit giving evil, like it's already in charge
[01:48:16.400 --> 01:48:21.520]  because it's willing to do bad things. It's like saying cancer is superior because it takes over
[01:48:21.520 --> 01:48:27.440]  a body. No, it ends up killing its own host. It's untenable. They can't help it. They are fallen.
[01:48:27.440 --> 01:48:30.000]  We need to stop seeing them as superior. They're not.
[01:48:30.000 --> 01:48:38.640]  Yeah, exactly. You state something very, very fascinating. And this is kind of almost a
[01:48:38.640 --> 01:48:46.560]  philosophical aside. These people's vision of the future is so evil that if they were to succeed,
[01:48:46.560 --> 01:48:51.440]  it would even destroy them ultimately. And that's the nature of evil. The nature of evil is that
[01:48:51.440 --> 01:48:57.040]  it cannot create. It can only destroy. If these people were successful, it would even destroy
[01:48:57.040 --> 01:49:00.240]  them in the end. That's the thing that's fascinating.
[01:49:00.240 --> 01:49:06.800]  Which shows their slaves of this force. So from your own deep teaching, going back thousands of
[01:49:06.800 --> 01:49:17.440]  years, what is this evil force? What is it? It is the demonic spirit. In every ancient religion
[01:49:17.440 --> 01:49:22.000]  upon the face of the earth, this is true for Hinduism as well. This is true for the Abrahamic
[01:49:22.000 --> 01:49:27.520]  religions. This is true for Buddhism. A lot of people don't know this. This is true for the Asian
[01:49:27.520 --> 01:49:33.280]  religions just as much as the Abrahamic religions. It has always been understood that there are,
[01:49:33.280 --> 01:49:39.760]  let's say, two spirits in the world. There are two ways of being in the world. There is the godly way
[01:49:39.760 --> 01:49:45.200]  of being, and then there is the demonic way of being. And let me state this very scientifically,
[01:49:45.200 --> 01:49:49.680]  actually, very philosophically. If you were to look at the totality of human beings,
[01:49:49.680 --> 01:49:59.040]  on the one side of the extreme, a tiny minority are individuals who are 100% godly. That's a small
[01:49:59.040 --> 01:50:05.120]  minority who they would never harm anyone. They only wish to do good. That's on one extreme. On
[01:50:05.120 --> 01:50:11.440]  the other extreme, you also have a tiny minority of individuals, again, whether it's one, two,
[01:50:11.440 --> 01:50:17.840]  three percent, who are the opposite. They are the psychopaths, the sociopaths. They are the
[01:50:17.840 --> 01:50:25.440]  narcissistic, demonic individuals who only think about harming people. And then you have the vast
[01:50:25.440 --> 01:50:30.080]  spectrum in between who are just kind of innocent, and they can kind of lean one way or another.
[01:50:30.720 --> 01:50:35.040]  This has been true from the very beginning of history and regardless of the culture that you're
[01:50:35.040 --> 01:50:42.080]  talking about. So what these individuals are is that indeed, they fall on the side of psychopathy.
[01:50:42.080 --> 01:50:46.640]  They are individuals who are demonic. Now, on the one hand, this can be understood in
[01:50:46.640 --> 01:50:53.280]  psychological terms, but we need to understand it spiritually. Many of these individuals, and again,
[01:50:53.280 --> 01:51:00.720]  the higher echelons of the demonic individuals, in the same way that good people commune with God,
[01:51:00.720 --> 01:51:09.200]  with angels, with positive beings, positive people, etc., this evil cabal at the highest elite,
[01:51:09.200 --> 01:51:15.120]  they commune with demonic beings. Demonic beings are reality. And indeed, again,
[01:51:15.120 --> 01:51:19.920]  every religion acknowledges this, including Hinduism, that there are, let's say,
[01:51:20.880 --> 01:51:27.280]  metaphysical demonic beings, beings who are not embodied, their spirits, but they are evil.
[01:51:27.280 --> 01:51:34.400]  Well, our human cabal of evil people are in direct communion with these evil beings.
[01:51:34.400 --> 01:51:35.520]  They're in an alliance.
[01:51:37.360 --> 01:51:42.160]  Yes. There is indeed an alliance, and it's a very real one. It's not a theoretical alliance.
[01:51:42.160 --> 01:51:48.880]  It's actually quite real. And again, these very evil people on the top, let me put it this way.
[01:51:49.920 --> 01:51:57.680]  Many of the middle echelon, deep staters, liberals, etc., will claim to be atheists.
[01:51:58.320 --> 01:52:05.520]  Let me put it this way. The evil people on top, trust me, they're not atheists. They know that
[01:52:05.520 --> 01:52:10.320]  there is God. They know that there are good beings, evil beings, etc. The only difference
[01:52:10.320 --> 01:52:14.640]  between these evil people and good peoples, they have chosen to side with the evil.
[01:52:15.680 --> 01:52:20.480]  Exactly. Take skull and bones. And thanks to Charlotte Isherby's dad, who was dying of cancer,
[01:52:20.480 --> 01:52:23.520]  and gave her the documents. She just died this year, a great lady.
[01:52:24.160 --> 01:52:28.880]  August late last year, she released all those to Anthony Sutton, the chief archivist at Congress,
[01:52:28.880 --> 01:52:34.800]  and they would take their sons who were not involved in it, when they were freshmen in college,
[01:52:34.800 --> 01:52:40.480]  and they would bring them in, and they would literally do rituals, satanic rituals, orgies,
[01:52:40.480 --> 01:52:45.680]  both homosexual, heterosexual, get in vats of feces, and then get in coffins for days,
[01:52:46.240 --> 01:52:52.800]  until a demon interface with them. And those that didn't got it pushed aside, literally,
[01:52:52.800 --> 01:52:57.040]  they would take up to three years to get them demon possessed or synced up with Satan.
[01:52:57.840 --> 01:53:02.000]  That's real, folks. And then these people end up running things. This is real. They believe in it.
[01:53:02.000 --> 01:53:09.120]  Absolutely. Absolutely. This is one of the goals of anyone who follows, oh, let's say,
[01:53:09.120 --> 01:53:16.880]  Luciferianism, left-hand path, Crowleyianism. There are many names for this dark, dark occult.
[01:53:17.520 --> 01:53:22.880]  One of their top goals as individuals is to ultimately commune with demonic beings,
[01:53:22.880 --> 01:53:26.560]  demonic entities. And that's what they said in skull and bones, the documents, dark angels.
[01:53:26.560 --> 01:53:35.760]  Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, exactly. Many different names for these beings. And again, I've known Luciferians.
[01:53:35.760 --> 01:53:42.560]  I've known them personally. They try to attack me all the time. From the lowest echelon of just
[01:53:42.560 --> 01:53:48.400]  some nobody who's dabbling in the black arts to the highest ones, people like Alistair Crowley,
[01:53:48.400 --> 01:53:55.360]  to way beyond him, their personal goal is to commune with one or another, or sometimes
[01:53:55.360 --> 01:54:01.600]  multiple demonic beings. And you see historically that, that they do. So for, you know, Alistair
[01:54:01.600 --> 01:54:08.000]  Crowley is one example. You know, he's one of, he was one of the high priests of Luciferianism,
[01:54:08.000 --> 01:54:14.000]  you know, Philema. And he is known to have indeed communed with demonic beings. Indeed,
[01:54:14.000 --> 01:54:18.880]  this is how several of his books were, quote, unquote, revealed it to him, is that he communed.
[01:54:18.880 --> 01:54:22.480]  And notice the first place seen in culture when he went to the Great Pyramid, when he was young,
[01:54:22.480 --> 01:54:27.200]  and the drawing he did of an alien, of a demon was a little gray alien.
[01:54:28.400 --> 01:54:33.440]  Exactly. Exactly. And it's amazing how so, so few people know this, but you can literally
[01:54:33.440 --> 01:54:41.280]  look this up online and you can see this image. Yes. The being who communicated to Alistair Crowley,
[01:54:41.280 --> 01:54:48.640]  his most important book was a demonic being called Lamb, L-A-M, who when you look at the
[01:54:48.640 --> 01:54:55.120]  drawing that he himself created, it's a gray alien. And we're talking about, oh, I don't know, 1912
[01:54:55.120 --> 01:55:01.600]  or something like this before anybody was talking about aliens, UFOs, etc. So yes, this is something
[01:55:01.600 --> 01:55:07.920]  that is very real. The occult, dark occult is something that is truly real. And it is this,
[01:55:07.920 --> 01:55:13.120]  these people's religion. And this is something we could, we could go into for not just hours,
[01:55:13.120 --> 01:55:17.840]  but days and weeks. And Atari, we are. So I finally got you on air. You're a really smart guy.
[01:55:17.840 --> 01:55:22.240]  I know I'm blown away by this. I want to have you back in the next few weeks. Again,
[01:55:22.240 --> 01:55:27.680]  next time you're in Austin in studio. Thank you so much. DharmaCentral.com, your book. I've read
[01:55:27.680 --> 01:55:32.320]  it. It's powerful. I had it on my kitchen table this morning with notes. And of course, forgot it
[01:55:32.320 --> 01:55:37.840]  and didn't bring it. But principle is a perfect leadership. Find it Amazon.com. Acharya, two
[01:55:37.840 --> 01:55:43.520]  minute closing comment. Very good. First of all, it's been my pleasure to be here with you, Alex.
[01:55:43.520 --> 01:55:49.360]  So this has been really, really wonderful. Thank you for having me on. And indeed, this is information
[01:55:49.360 --> 01:55:54.080]  that people need to know. This is the reality of the world. The reality of the world is not what
[01:55:54.080 --> 01:55:59.360]  Hollywood tells us. It's not what the media tells us. It's not what Disney tells us. It certainly
[01:55:59.360 --> 01:56:06.480]  is not what the media, meaning the news media tells us in any way whatsoever. The world is
[01:56:06.480 --> 01:56:13.680]  infinitely more complex and interesting, actually, in both good and bad ways than anyone would imagine.
[01:56:13.680 --> 01:56:20.560]  So let me just say again, I need to congratulate you for the fact that for decades now, you have
[01:56:20.560 --> 01:56:27.200]  done everything in your power given a million challenges and pushback and everything to try
[01:56:27.200 --> 01:56:33.120]  to reveal this knowledge to individuals. And let me tell you, you personally are responsible
[01:56:33.120 --> 01:56:38.720]  probably for the awakening of millions of people in this world. So it is absolutely my pleasure
[01:56:38.720 --> 01:56:44.640]  to be on here with you and I would be very happy to do this again. I am at your service anytime
[01:56:44.640 --> 01:56:48.880]  you'd like to have me back on. All right, Acharya. Thank you because we've talked for three, four hours
[01:56:48.880 --> 01:56:53.520]  at a time. And we need to come back and do like a three hour show. You can just come on and go
[01:56:53.520 --> 01:56:56.960]  through whatever you want because me interrupting gets you diverted and distracted, but you did a
[01:56:56.960 --> 01:57:02.480]  great job. DharmaCentral.com. Acharya, thank you so much for your great book. The Principles of
[01:57:02.480 --> 01:57:06.960]  Perfect Leadership. And God bless you. We look forward to speaking to you soon. Absolutely. Take
[01:57:06.960 --> 01:57:13.920]  care. Thank you. All right. Wow. That was powerful. We got another big special guest coming up on the
[01:57:13.920 --> 01:57:20.240]  nature of the world. Big predictions. A surprise guest. We'll tell you when we come back here in
[01:57:20.240 --> 01:57:26.320]  just a few minutes. I've got some more news to hit as well. But again, this is important information
[01:57:26.320 --> 01:57:32.480]  folks. Evil's real. God's real. We'll be right back. Don't let the globalist monsters and their
[01:57:32.480 --> 01:57:38.240]  mercenary minions be successful at silencing you. And the globalist number one mission is to

[01:58:50.080 --> 01:58:58.880]  this is your song.

[01:59:16.320 --> 01:59:21.440]  the most important information. And then this week, believe me, if you want to tune in,
[01:59:21.440 --> 01:59:26.080]  you're going to see some fireworks on the Info Wars broadcast. I'm going to leave it at that for
[01:59:26.080 --> 01:59:33.600]  you. We got a lot of big, fat, juicy, white hot irons in the fire. Woo! Quote Rick Flair.
[01:59:34.640 --> 01:59:40.160]  All right. A very requested guest. He's been big for years, but blowing up. Mark Passio,
[01:59:40.160 --> 01:59:44.880]  author, researcher, the guy that really cracks the code on natural law while everything's going
[01:59:44.880 --> 01:59:49.440]  haywire. While there's evil forces that want to break that code, even though it's going to
[01:59:49.440 --> 01:59:53.440]  destroy them in the end. So, so he's really an esoteric expert knows this stuff because I've
[01:59:53.440 --> 01:59:57.040]  done my own research. I know a BS or versus somebody that's done deep research, but I want to
[01:59:57.040 --> 02:00:01.440]  get Mark on really commercial free here and try to just shut up and let him talk. He's usually on
[02:00:01.440 --> 02:00:05.200]  the regular show and people complain. Hey, well, there's 14 minutes of ads an hour because we're
[02:00:05.200 --> 02:00:09.360]  on 400 plus radio stations and that's the standard format for TV and radio, you know,
[02:00:09.360 --> 02:00:13.200]  old line media. It's part of that. He platformed us. We're still on air because of those and
[02:00:13.200 --> 02:00:18.400]  use talk radio to build back up what we've done. But I promised to do more and more of these podcast
[02:00:18.400 --> 02:00:22.800]  formats that are so popular. Average ones get about 2 million views. And so I just appreciate
[02:00:22.800 --> 02:00:30.480]  you all taking clips out, sharing it, reposting it. It's commercial, your trademark, copyright free.
[02:00:30.480 --> 02:00:36.400]  I want everything we do to be shared to the forewinds. So Mark Passio, author, researcher,
[02:00:36.400 --> 02:00:41.600]  what on earth is happening.com joins us. And I'm going to just ask him up front,
[02:00:41.600 --> 02:00:47.920]  what on earth, what on earth is really happening? You get into why things are broken,
[02:00:47.920 --> 02:00:52.240]  but why are they going against natural law? And what are they going to build if they succeed?
[02:00:52.240 --> 02:00:57.120]  And what do you make of the elections in the Ukraine war and the transgenderism and just
[02:00:57.120 --> 02:01:03.760]  all of this to know ourselves? We need to also know our enemy. And so we've talked a lot about
[02:01:03.760 --> 02:01:08.560]  the positive out of transcend them. We'll hit some of that later in the hour. But just studying the
[02:01:08.560 --> 02:01:13.360]  enemy because the average person that kind of follows natural law gets common sense,
[02:01:13.360 --> 02:01:17.120]  doesn't want to hurt people, doesn't want to piss in the pool because other people are going to piss
[02:01:17.120 --> 02:01:22.880]  in the pool. Who are these globalists? Why are they so wicked? What's their problem? Mark Passio,
[02:01:22.880 --> 02:01:27.920]  thank you so much for joining us on this special Saturday broadcast. Alex, thank you so much for
[02:01:27.920 --> 02:01:33.520]  having me on. It's a pleasure to be here. So yeah, to get into that material, who these people really
[02:01:33.520 --> 02:01:41.760]  are are occultists. They are people who know hidden knowledge about human psychology and hidden
[02:01:41.760 --> 02:01:51.120]  knowledge about the laws of nature. And in knowing all of that information at a very, very deep,
[02:01:51.120 --> 02:01:59.200]  profound esoteric level about how human psyche functions, how it operates, how it can be manipulated,
[02:01:59.200 --> 02:02:07.200]  how all the laws of nature work and function. And most importantly, how natural law really works,
[02:02:07.200 --> 02:02:15.200]  which are the moral laws of creation, the universal non manmade, eternal and immutable laws of
[02:02:15.200 --> 02:02:23.520]  behavioral consequence that are completely inherent to nature. These people are exploiting
[02:02:23.520 --> 02:02:30.800]  the ignorance of the human masses through their knowledge of that information combined with the
[02:02:30.800 --> 02:02:39.840]  fact that they are in fact psychopathic, total control freaks, completely immoral, wanting complete
[02:02:39.840 --> 02:02:47.600]  control over human beings and ultimately what they really want and what is happening on this planet
[02:02:47.600 --> 02:02:55.280]  is slavery. That is their ultimate goal. People think that it's just power, influence, money
[02:02:55.280 --> 02:03:02.880]  in the world. It's it's those are means to an end. They are not the end goal in and of itself.
[02:03:02.880 --> 02:03:10.160]  And I've been telling this to people for about 15 years now, their end goal is the permanent,
[02:03:10.160 --> 02:03:19.600]  entrenched slavery of all of humanity, with them being a very, very, very tiny, tiny percentage
[02:03:19.600 --> 02:03:28.320]  of the whole human population, ruling that slave class as gods on earth. This is what their ultimate
[02:03:28.320 --> 02:03:34.400]  goal is. This is what they want to achieve. And they are beginning the process in the
[02:03:34.400 --> 02:03:44.160]  post COVID post pandemic, I call it the post pandemic Psyop time that we are living in.
[02:03:45.600 --> 02:03:55.200]  What they are moving toward is an overt form of slavery. See, we are already living under
[02:03:55.200 --> 02:04:02.080]  covert slavery. I'm sorry. Yes, we are living under covert slavery. We are living under occulted
[02:04:02.080 --> 02:04:08.240]  slavery, meaning it's hidden from the eyes of the average human being. They cannot readily see
[02:04:08.880 --> 02:04:13.920]  the complete slavery that human beings are already really living under. It's been
[02:04:14.960 --> 02:04:21.200]  hidden from their awareness so that they will not rebel against it. The perfect slave is one who
[02:04:21.200 --> 02:04:26.480]  has been made to not understand that they're already in the state of slavery because they're
[02:04:26.480 --> 02:04:33.120]  living in a state of duress. They're living in a state of implied threat of violence.
[02:04:33.120 --> 02:04:39.360]  If they do not comply with the commands of the ruling class, of the occult ruling class.
[02:04:39.920 --> 02:04:49.600]  So they now in the post pandemic world, they want to move their control into an even deeper
[02:04:49.600 --> 02:04:56.240]  and more entrenched state where it is no longer just a covert form of slavery. They want to move
[02:04:56.240 --> 02:05:02.240]  it into an overt form of slavery where they are going to come out. They call this in the occult
[02:05:02.240 --> 02:05:09.440]  world the externalization of the hierarchy, the hierarchy of power, the hierarchy of control.
[02:05:09.440 --> 02:05:14.240]  That is going to be externalized now. They're already beginning to do that. They've already
[02:05:14.240 --> 02:05:20.000]  written white papers and books and just come out on interviews openly and say we're going to turn
[02:05:20.000 --> 02:05:25.840]  people into an algorithm. We're going to turn them into a robot that really does not have
[02:05:25.840 --> 02:05:31.360]  free will where free will is a complete illusion and they can only respond to the algorithms
[02:05:31.360 --> 02:05:36.240]  that we programmed into them. And that is the state that they are trying to move the world into
[02:05:36.240 --> 02:05:44.160]  at this point. And there is a subtle war going on between the rulers of the world. Some of them
[02:05:44.160 --> 02:05:51.920]  want to remain in this form of covert or occult control. And now I would say if I had to make a
[02:05:51.920 --> 02:05:59.120]  guesstimate I'd say maybe about one in five, one in six of them maybe wants to move this form of
[02:05:59.120 --> 02:06:07.600]  control to absolute overt in your face slavery where they would come out in the open and basically
[02:06:07.600 --> 02:06:14.720]  say we are your rulers. You are our slaves and subjects. If you do not comply to our commands
[02:06:14.720 --> 02:06:20.160]  we will send our armies, our militaries, our police to simply eliminate you and kill you.
[02:06:20.160 --> 02:06:25.040]  And let's expand on that. Let's expand on that. They could just kill most of us as robots but
[02:06:25.040 --> 02:06:30.640]  they want the ritual of us submitting and bowing and we look at drag queen story time with pedophiles
[02:06:30.640 --> 02:06:35.200]  all of it is about the most extreme thing to see if we'll just give up and roll over. You're
[02:06:35.200 --> 02:06:40.000]  absolutely right. They're going from beta to operational. Why are they emerging right now?
[02:06:40.000 --> 02:06:47.600]  Is it out of strength or weakness? I feel that they believe that they have humanity in the mental
[02:06:47.600 --> 02:06:55.360]  place exactly where they want them. They feel that they have prepared us psychologically for
[02:06:55.360 --> 02:07:01.360]  slavery and ultimately slaughter. And you know as you said this isn't just even about that. This
[02:07:01.360 --> 02:07:09.920]  is about the degradation of the human soul. They ultimately want to destroy the soul of human beings.
[02:07:09.920 --> 02:07:15.920]  That is what they want in their ultimate long-term plan, their ultimate long-term goal and agenda
[02:07:15.920 --> 02:07:24.160]  is to capture the soul of human beings. Slavery itself is actually a means on to that end
[02:07:24.160 --> 02:07:30.720]  because slavery is the complete destruction of the soul. There is no lower state of consciousness
[02:07:30.720 --> 02:07:37.440]  that a being can exist in because in that state what has been removed from the being and from
[02:07:37.440 --> 02:07:43.360]  their whole mental makeup, their whole spiritual makeup is the greatest gift of the creator of
[02:07:43.360 --> 02:07:51.760]  the universe, free will. Free will is what we have been gifted as a birthright to use to create
[02:07:51.760 --> 02:07:58.960]  whatever conditions we wish to create for ourselves. And what these globalist satanic occultists
[02:07:58.960 --> 02:08:06.080]  want to ultimately do is to destroy the human soul by destroying free will. That is the lowest
[02:08:06.080 --> 02:08:13.200]  state of consciousness that they can put people into through a form of seduction through a form
[02:08:13.200 --> 02:08:20.080]  of mental influence and what I just simply call mind control. What is really going on is that they
[02:08:20.080 --> 02:08:26.640]  have mind-controlled people into believing through their media, through their school systems, etc.
[02:08:27.280 --> 02:08:34.400]  that there is legitimacy to the concept of human authority. This is the new religion. The new
[02:08:34.400 --> 02:08:40.400]  religion is that government is God, that authority is God, that their dictates must be obeyed,
[02:08:40.400 --> 02:08:46.720]  that we must comply, that we have some sort of moral obligation to comply to their dictates
[02:08:46.720 --> 02:08:56.560]  and commands. And all this is a continuation in the modern world of the old religion of kingship.
[02:08:57.120 --> 02:09:03.680]  Authority was always vested in the old world. The old world order, as many researchers call it,
[02:09:03.680 --> 02:09:11.520]  was kingship. It was one ruler or one family, perhaps a dynastic family, ruling over other
[02:09:11.520 --> 02:09:17.440]  people as their subjects. The people were the subjects and then they called the king or the
[02:09:17.440 --> 02:09:23.840]  queen the sovereign, the one who is above rulership. And there is only one or a small select group of
[02:09:23.840 --> 02:09:29.200]  royalty and they get to, they are the ruling class and they get to rule everybody else.
[02:09:29.200 --> 02:09:33.520]  And let's expand on that. They're trying to go back to that. So they called the old world order, but
[02:09:33.520 --> 02:09:38.240]  really the new world order is trying to take us back to that. What would you call the Renaissance
[02:09:38.240 --> 02:09:42.400]  and the Great Enlightenment? Was that a good thing or a bad thing? And why do we see our revolution
[02:09:42.960 --> 02:09:50.400]  in 1776, simultaneously by Adam Weisop's revolution over in Europe? I see that as two
[02:09:50.400 --> 02:09:56.320]  competing factions realizing that the turning point was there. Absolutely. Great question,
[02:09:56.320 --> 02:10:01.840]  Alex, and I'll unpack that a little bit. You know, again, the old world order, this form of
[02:10:01.840 --> 02:10:09.200]  authority vested in one being, the king or the queen. I ask people to be honest with themselves
[02:10:09.200 --> 02:10:17.040]  and look at this from a purely moral perspective. Was that condition that humanity was often forced
[02:10:17.040 --> 02:10:21.920]  to live under in any particular geographic region of this planet in the ancient world,
[02:10:21.920 --> 02:10:29.680]  was that situation ever moral? Could it ever have been moral? There is no free will involved,
[02:10:29.680 --> 02:10:34.720]  there is coercion involved, there is duress involved, and there is violence ultimately
[02:10:34.720 --> 02:10:42.880]  involved. That situation can never be moral. And now they have moved it into the space of
[02:10:42.880 --> 02:10:50.080]  creating a new form of this ancient control system, a new form of this old religion,
[02:10:50.080 --> 02:10:56.080]  the old world order. They are now making a new version of it in the modern day. This is the new
[02:10:56.080 --> 02:11:02.640]  world order, or what I call in my research, the dark new world order, because as you rightfully
[02:11:02.640 --> 02:11:11.520]  said, there are competing aspects to what can be created in the future for a new world. And
[02:11:11.520 --> 02:11:16.000]  there I look at it as there's a dark new world order that we can move toward, and we already
[02:11:16.000 --> 02:11:21.680]  are moving toward that as a species very rapidly actually. And then there's a light new world
[02:11:21.680 --> 02:11:27.200]  order, there's a positive new world that we are capable of creating. So just the term new world
[02:11:27.200 --> 02:11:32.960]  order in and of itself, I don't see as a negative thing. And that may horrify some of the viewing
[02:11:32.960 --> 02:11:37.600]  audience because they've been so conditioned to believe that just those words are just negative
[02:11:37.600 --> 02:11:44.400]  in and of themselves. There can be a positive new world order if we work to dispel the myth
[02:11:44.400 --> 02:11:51.200]  of the religion of authority. If we can understand true sovereignty, not the sovereignty of a king
[02:11:51.200 --> 02:11:58.800]  or queen, not the the alleged authority of a government that is simply the same extension
[02:11:58.800 --> 02:12:05.440]  of the old world order of authority of a king, that is just now divested into a few oligarchical
[02:12:06.240 --> 02:12:12.160]  an oligarchical group of people, a few rulers calling themselves government, okay, and claiming
[02:12:12.160 --> 02:12:19.440]  that they are our owners. Exactly. So why did the Illuminati form as that model? And why was it
[02:12:19.440 --> 02:12:23.920]  selling freedom against the old royalty, but also here in the new world? And was there a split
[02:12:23.920 --> 02:12:28.640]  between George Washington and Thomas Jefferson's Illuminati and Adam Weishaupt's Illuminati?
[02:12:29.600 --> 02:12:37.360]  I would say definitely. The Weishaupt Illuminati or the Bavarian Illuminati that was very active
[02:12:37.360 --> 02:12:46.160]  in the mid and then late 1700s was a dark occult organization. And they originally called themselves
[02:12:46.160 --> 02:12:54.240]  the perfectabilists, the perfect ones. I mean, imagine the hubris, the psychological hubris
[02:12:54.240 --> 02:12:59.200]  that you have to have to believe that you are perfected, that there is nothing else that you
[02:12:59.200 --> 02:13:06.720]  can work to achieve except controlling others. And they needed to break down the old world structure.
[02:13:06.720 --> 02:13:14.240]  This was in earnest beginning because of the ideas of freedom that had been ceded in,
[02:13:15.280 --> 02:13:22.880]  you know, the early Americas, in early America, they knew that they needed to move to a form
[02:13:22.880 --> 02:13:28.080]  of covert control through what they call. Exactly. That's what my analysis is, is that was the
[02:13:28.080 --> 02:13:32.640]  counterrevolution against the human revolution, not that ours was perfect, but it had a lot of the
[02:13:32.640 --> 02:13:37.120]  right people involved, a lot of good ideas, and they saw it as a threat. So a few years after ours,
[02:13:37.120 --> 02:13:43.040]  they launched theirs. That's right. That's right. See, you know, the Enlightenment period led to the
[02:13:43.040 --> 02:13:52.640]  ideas that originally formed our country, early America. And without those philosophies, and you
[02:13:52.640 --> 02:13:59.680]  could, you know, rightly call that time period an occult revival, because a lot of the philosophers
[02:13:59.680 --> 02:14:05.600]  discussed natural philosophy, they discussed natural law, which I want to qualify when I use the term
[02:14:05.600 --> 02:14:13.200]  natural law has nothing to do with the so-called laws of nature as Darwinism puts it forward.
[02:14:13.200 --> 02:14:18.880]  This is not Darwinian theory. This is not survival of the fittest, survival of the most
[02:14:18.880 --> 02:14:24.880]  ruthless. This is in social Darwinism. Natural law is the laws of God. It's the laws of the
[02:14:24.880 --> 02:14:31.040]  creator of the universe. It's moral law. It's spiritual law. And those are the ideas that are
[02:14:31.040 --> 02:14:37.120]  ultimately enshrined in early America that the people are sovereign beings, that we are above
[02:14:37.120 --> 02:14:44.800]  rulership, that there is no legitimacy to ruling over other beings. And unfortunately,
[02:14:45.680 --> 02:14:50.320]  you know, the early founders of America and the early philosophers of that time period
[02:14:50.320 --> 02:14:57.120]  only took that idea so far. They still used the old model of, you know, kingship and almost
[02:14:57.120 --> 02:15:03.360]  created a monarchy, and then decided that they would create a representational form of government.
[02:15:03.360 --> 02:15:10.480]  Now, I myself feel that that's an axiomatically flawed idea. It's an axiomatically flawed
[02:15:10.480 --> 02:15:15.200]  ideology. But it's still a big step away from monarchy.
[02:15:15.200 --> 02:15:22.080]  That's correct. It is definitely, it definitely was a stepping stone, which is why I personally,
[02:15:22.080 --> 02:15:28.320]  even as an anarchist, do not crucify the founding fathers and the people who originally
[02:15:28.320 --> 02:15:34.960]  created the nation that we now know as the United States of America. I feel that without their ideas,
[02:15:34.960 --> 02:15:41.200]  we would not be able to push the envelope even farther and really push for true human freedom.
[02:15:41.200 --> 02:15:44.080]  Exactly. We've got to look at the time they were in and how revolutionary it was.
[02:15:44.080 --> 02:15:49.760]  Absolutely. And how absolutely, it was like a powder keg at that time. It could have gone in
[02:15:49.760 --> 02:15:53.600]  many, many different directions. People will again, often, you know,
[02:15:54.320 --> 02:15:57.120]  Oh, the French Revolution went in the wrong direction. Yeah.
[02:15:57.920 --> 02:16:05.440]  It definitely went toward a, you know, a socialist direction that no doubt influenced by
[02:16:05.440 --> 02:16:11.040]  dark occultists, a dark occultist at the time. But, you know, people want to, you know, always
[02:16:11.040 --> 02:16:16.480]  beat up on the founding fathers and denigrate them because, you know, some of them did during their,
[02:16:16.480 --> 02:16:23.760]  you know, lifetime keep human slaves that were a product of being handed down to them from their,
[02:16:23.760 --> 02:16:29.440]  their family members, their, their, their family lines. And many of the northern founding fathers
[02:16:29.440 --> 02:16:36.960]  were absolutely against it and thought that this was a hideous, deplorable practice and worked
[02:16:36.960 --> 02:16:42.480]  tirelessly to try to abolish it even in their time period. Of course, that didn't have a mechanism
[02:16:42.480 --> 02:16:49.360]  to even free the people. That's right. Absolutely. It was so against the law to even attempt to free
[02:16:49.360 --> 02:16:54.960]  a slave that the person that would attempt to do that would all would be executed if they were
[02:16:54.960 --> 02:17:00.640]  found to willingly have released the slave into the population. That is how horrific the time
[02:17:00.640 --> 02:17:05.680]  period was and how horrific the laws were at that time. So, you know, Thomas Jefferson wrote
[02:17:05.680 --> 02:17:10.960]  anti-slavery clauses into the original draft of the Declaration of Independence when he framed it
[02:17:10.960 --> 02:17:17.680]  here in Philadelphia. And he was forced by southern delegates who looked at that as an offense to them
[02:17:18.560 --> 02:17:25.040]  to remove it or they were going to walk out of the Continental Congress in mass and, and let
[02:17:25.600 --> 02:17:30.400]  the notion for American independence die in committee. And there would have not been an
[02:17:30.400 --> 02:17:36.240]  independent country called the United States of America if, you know, Jefferson did not
[02:17:36.240 --> 02:17:42.400]  capitulate to having those clauses removed. He did so at the behest of Benjamin Franklin and John
[02:17:42.400 --> 02:17:47.120]  Adams who said that we have to fight one more at a time. We have to fight the British now.
[02:17:47.120 --> 02:17:51.440]  That's right. And then Jefferson went to France and for a time was the head of the Illuminati
[02:17:51.440 --> 02:17:54.720]  but then turned against it. They tried to kill him. He had to flee France. I mean,
[02:17:54.720 --> 02:17:56.640]  this is in the main line of history. People don't know this.
[02:17:56.640 --> 02:18:02.000]  Absolutely. He knew that there were dark occult influences, particularly in the Masonic lodges
[02:18:02.000 --> 02:18:07.200]  of his day. And he wrote about it and warned people about it. And they use secret societies.
[02:18:07.200 --> 02:18:15.360]  They use, you know, occult brotherhoods to enact secrecy and to basically network with other people
[02:18:15.360 --> 02:18:21.840]  of an occult mindset. They recruit this way. They plan this way. This has been done for centuries
[02:18:21.840 --> 02:18:27.760]  upon centuries. So, you know, it's no different now than it was then. They're still operating through
[02:18:27.760 --> 02:18:33.760]  modern occult societies. And occult means, Mark, you're a really smart guy. I really want your
[02:18:33.760 --> 02:18:38.560]  opinions. I know you probably research is even deeper than I have. What was the force? We know
[02:18:38.560 --> 02:18:44.720]  there wasn't one force behind our revolution versus that advice hop and the perfected ones
[02:18:46.240 --> 02:18:50.800]  revolution and why did George Washington write all those letters against the European Illuminati
[02:18:50.800 --> 02:18:55.840]  that we have on screen? Because we know there was a real split there. Who was behind the European
[02:18:55.840 --> 02:19:00.240]  Illuminati from your deep research versus the American Illuminati? Because let's be honest,
[02:19:00.240 --> 02:19:04.720]  George Washington, Thomas Jefferson were the leaders the Illuminati, but the American version.
[02:19:06.640 --> 02:19:12.560]  Okay, so, you know, the Bavarian Illuminati, I look at as it was a synthesis of occultists that
[02:19:12.560 --> 02:19:17.440]  came together because they knew that the old religion was waning and people did not want to
[02:19:17.440 --> 02:19:24.400]  live under overt kingship. They saw it as why does this one being get to decide the fate of
[02:19:24.400 --> 02:19:29.760]  everybody else? And they knew that that was going to be slipping as a method of holding
[02:19:29.760 --> 02:19:35.360]  power in the world. They knew that they had to create the new world order of doing it covertly
[02:19:35.360 --> 02:19:40.640]  through governments where they gave people the illusion of choice through voting and gave them
[02:19:40.640 --> 02:19:44.880]  the illusion that they were actually calling the shots and that the people were the government,
[02:19:44.880 --> 02:19:51.440]  which has never really truly been the case. This is a PSYOP in and of itself to create the new world
[02:19:51.440 --> 02:19:56.720]  order of government authority and make people believe in that, make people believe that it is
[02:19:56.720 --> 02:20:04.080]  morally acceptable and morally legitimate when it is based upon all of the same axiomatic premises
[02:20:04.080 --> 02:20:11.360]  that the old world order of kingship was based upon. So it's still based in one class of people
[02:20:11.360 --> 02:20:16.080]  considering themselves a ruling class dictating to other people that they consider their subjects
[02:20:16.080 --> 02:20:22.960]  or their slaves and then ruling through coercion, ruling through duress, ruling through violence
[02:20:22.960 --> 02:20:29.040]  if necessary. But it's always a state of implied violence and this is what people have to learn
[02:20:29.040 --> 02:20:34.080]  is that there is no moral legitimacy to the very concept of authority whether you're talking about
[02:20:34.080 --> 02:20:39.360]  the old world authority of kingship or the new world authority of government. That's the idea
[02:20:39.360 --> 02:20:45.680]  that human beings and humanity must transcend. We must transcend that to understand that we can.
[02:20:45.680 --> 02:20:52.000]  It is possible to build a society based in voluntary behavior and voluntary cooperation.
[02:20:52.000 --> 02:20:57.040]  It does not mean that we cannot organize against external potential violent threats,
[02:20:57.040 --> 02:21:01.280]  come together to organize through self-defense. It doesn't mean that we can't build
[02:21:01.280 --> 02:21:06.800]  monumental engineering projects together through voluntary cooperation. Organization
[02:21:06.800 --> 02:21:12.480]  does not necessarily have to contain or imply authority. It is simply people coming together
[02:21:12.480 --> 02:21:17.280]  to perform a task that they know that is required for their betterment. That's all
[02:21:17.280 --> 02:21:22.880]  that really needs to be done in order to create a voluntary society. When people suggest an anarchic
[02:21:22.880 --> 02:21:27.760]  state of existence, which simply means that there are no rulers, it doesn't imply every
[02:21:27.760 --> 02:21:34.000]  world problem is solved overnight. It doesn't imply that there will never be acts of violence
[02:21:34.000 --> 02:21:40.640]  committed by individual members of humanity upon others. It is not a utopia. It is a very
[02:21:40.640 --> 02:21:47.040]  pragmatic real world state where many, many, many problems of humanity still exist and would have to
[02:21:47.040 --> 02:21:55.520]  be worked toward in a way that is cooperative and voluntary. A state of anarchy does not imply
[02:21:55.520 --> 02:22:02.320]  no problems or utopia whatsoever. As a realist, you would realize those problems would absolutely
[02:22:02.320 --> 02:22:06.640]  still be present and humanity would still have to work toward figuring out solutions to all of
[02:22:06.640 --> 02:22:13.120]  those types of problems. But what it does mean is that there would be a general moral state of
[02:22:13.120 --> 02:22:19.360]  existence because people would not believe that the idea of authority, which in and of itself
[02:22:19.360 --> 02:22:25.680]  is backed by violence, would be some type of a morally acceptable condition. They would understand
[02:22:26.240 --> 02:22:31.040]  by definition that that is an immoral state because violence is always immoral.
[02:22:31.040 --> 02:22:37.680]  What a true anarchist advocates for, such as myself, is a state where people are not performing
[02:22:37.680 --> 02:22:44.000]  violence upon others, certainly not in a wide scale sense like government allows to take place,
[02:22:44.000 --> 02:22:50.880]  like enshrining a government and putting it in power, emboldens them to enact upon the rest.
[02:22:50.880 --> 02:22:56.400]  Well, sure, but I mean, I expand on that, but your system would obviously work as Thomas Jefferson
[02:22:56.400 --> 02:23:02.320]  kind of predicted in the future if the public was educated on the tenets of liberty and defended it
[02:23:02.320 --> 02:23:06.480]  and had their own land and produce their own food. He said, you've got to know this and you've
[02:23:06.480 --> 02:23:10.240]  got to have your own independence. You've got to know how to take care of yourself. Then we
[02:23:10.240 --> 02:23:15.200]  create the basic utopia. But without that, we always produce a new hell and expanding on that.
[02:23:15.200 --> 02:23:21.440]  When the Jacobin Illuminati failed at the French Revolution, put a dictator in Napoleon Bonaparte,
[02:23:21.440 --> 02:23:28.640]  then out of that, we see British intelligence and others fomenting Communism with Marx and Ingalls
[02:23:28.640 --> 02:23:35.040]  on record by British intelligence as a new way to con all these serfs in Europe and in Russia,
[02:23:35.040 --> 02:23:39.360]  getting and in America in interest servants and blacks, getting off the plantation. Well,
[02:23:39.360 --> 02:23:44.960]  now there's a new thing where a new Communist leader organizes you under their control,
[02:23:44.960 --> 02:23:47.360]  the actual antithesis of real human power.
[02:23:47.360 --> 02:23:54.560]  Absolutely, Alex. You're spot on, dead on. As a matter of fact, when you really start studying
[02:23:54.560 --> 02:24:03.040]  the occult underpinnings of such types of revolutions, you'll come back to people like
[02:24:03.040 --> 02:24:09.840]  Adam Weishaupt and then his successor, Giuseppe Mazzini. Mazzini actually created the modern
[02:24:09.840 --> 02:24:16.960]  Italian mafia. And he was in contact in the American Civil War with Albert Pike.
[02:24:16.960 --> 02:24:22.880]  So these guys are all coordinated. That's right. That's right. And the main thing that Mazzini did
[02:24:22.880 --> 02:24:30.480]  was he formed an organization called Young Germany. I'm sorry, Young Italy. Young Italy.
[02:24:30.480 --> 02:24:36.960]  And he then became very good friends with Carl Schaper. And a lot of people don't know who that
[02:24:36.960 --> 02:24:44.160]  is, but Carl Schaper formed an organization called Young Germany that then paved the way to being
[02:24:44.160 --> 02:24:51.680]  the Communist League, which penned the Communist Manifesto under Marx and Engels, you know,
[02:24:51.680 --> 02:24:58.000]  authorship. Now, slow down. Say that again. Direct lines to the Illuminati founding Communism.
[02:24:58.000 --> 02:25:01.840]  This is on record historically, folks. This is in main line history books, but nobody,
[02:25:02.480 --> 02:25:07.520]  start over. This is important. Yeah, you can research this anywhere. The roots of Communism
[02:25:07.520 --> 02:25:10.800]  directly to the Illuminati and the French Revolution. Explain it.
[02:25:10.800 --> 02:25:20.240]  Yeah. So Schaper formed Young Germany, which was patterned on Mazzini's Young Italy. And Mazzini
[02:25:20.240 --> 02:25:25.680]  was the second grandmaster of the group that we have been referencing here today, the Bavarian
[02:25:25.680 --> 02:25:32.240]  Illuminati that was began by Adam Weishaupt. He was the second grandmaster after Weishaupt became
[02:25:32.240 --> 02:25:37.200]  in firm and ill and could no longer perform the duties of being the grandmaster of the Bavarian
[02:25:37.200 --> 02:25:44.480]  Illuminati. He handed over the reins to Giuseppe Mazzini. Again, Mazzini formed what you would
[02:25:44.480 --> 02:25:52.000]  call the very underpinnings and the basis of what we would call the Italian Mafia or La Cosa Nostra.
[02:25:52.000 --> 02:25:57.760]  And, you know, his that was his way of ruling, you know, through direct implied violence,
[02:25:57.760 --> 02:26:03.040]  you know, running gangs, running criminal syndicates, etc. You can call him one of the
[02:26:03.040 --> 02:26:08.400]  original godfathers, one of the original capos. And, you know, this organization,
[02:26:09.520 --> 02:26:17.680]  Young Italy, was the beginnings of fascism, you know, and then, you know, the opposite wing when
[02:26:18.480 --> 02:26:28.160]  his protege, Carl Schaper, you know, was beginning to exert his influence in Germany and eventually
[02:26:28.160 --> 02:26:34.480]  spread it to other areas of Europe, such as England, he formed the Communist League.
[02:26:34.480 --> 02:26:43.280]  And that is what, as I said, then, you know, the pen men for, you know, modern communism were,
[02:26:43.280 --> 02:26:48.080]  of course, Marx and Engels, but they were doing this at the behest of these occult organizations.
[02:26:48.080 --> 02:26:54.080]  It was a very clear agenda for those who are studied in the occult and, you know, its methodologies,
[02:26:54.080 --> 02:27:00.960]  that this is how they fomented revolution throughout, you know, all of, you know, Eastern Europe and,
[02:27:01.760 --> 02:27:05.280]  you know, started spreading socialism and communism throughout the world.
[02:27:05.840 --> 02:27:11.840]  This is the neo feudalism that they want to create. That's what communism ultimately really is.
[02:27:11.840 --> 02:27:17.280]  I mean, fascism, of course, is just as evil. But many people always talk about the evils of
[02:27:17.280 --> 02:27:23.920]  fascism, but they neglect to talk about the evils of communism. Communism is just international
[02:27:23.920 --> 02:27:31.120]  socialism taken to its extreme where all of the production and distribution methods are in the
[02:27:31.120 --> 02:27:37.600]  hands of the state, and they can control who gets food. They can control, you know, who is able to
[02:27:37.600 --> 02:27:45.360]  live and sustain themselves. That is ultimately what the goal is to create a form of neo feudalism.
[02:27:45.360 --> 02:27:51.520]  Feudalism and, you know, what's the main tenet of communism, the first tenet of the ten planks is
[02:27:51.520 --> 02:27:58.080]  the abolition of private property, right? That's a surf. A surf has no right to own property. He
[02:27:58.080 --> 02:28:02.480]  just lives upon the land. He rents the house that he's in. He, you know, rents it from the
[02:28:02.480 --> 02:28:09.280]  king or queen. And, you know, it's a form of feudalism. This is what they're trying to create.
[02:28:09.280 --> 02:28:11.840]  He will own nothing and he will like it. Klaus Schwab.
[02:28:12.720 --> 02:28:18.320]  No property. All rights are derived from property rights, right? Without property,
[02:28:18.320 --> 02:28:23.600]  there is no such thing as the understanding of rights, because the understanding of rights
[02:28:23.600 --> 02:28:28.560]  means that you know what you rightfully own and you know what you rightfully do not own,
[02:28:28.560 --> 02:28:36.080]  and you don't step across those boundary lines of property so that you don't transgress against
[02:28:36.080 --> 02:28:41.520]  other people's property, like their life, their rights, their free will association,
[02:28:41.520 --> 02:28:50.000]  their rights, etc. This is the basis of natural law. The basis of moral law in the universe
[02:28:50.000 --> 02:28:56.000]  is that you do not steal. Every moral transgression is a form of theft.
[02:28:56.720 --> 02:29:01.360]  And communists come in and steal whatever they want, and it's always super rich people running
[02:29:01.360 --> 02:29:08.240]  it. That's right. And you know, the book by Gary Allen, None Dare Call Conspiracy,
[02:29:08.240 --> 02:29:15.360]  explains this. It lays it out in an absolutely irrefutable, well-researched way, where extremely
[02:29:16.000 --> 02:29:20.240]  influential and very powerful members of society. Pressure from above, pressure below,
[02:29:20.240 --> 02:29:30.320]  starting to rub. That's absolutely correct. You know, these high-level power brokers always
[02:29:30.320 --> 02:29:36.480]  want to bring the people into the idea of socialism. They want to sell them on that because
[02:29:36.480 --> 02:29:43.680]  it sounds caring. It sounds moral. It sounds like it's just sharing, right? But ultimately,
[02:29:43.680 --> 02:29:47.680]  what you're doing is you're getting the people. Again, that's the pressure from above, and the
[02:29:47.680 --> 02:29:53.840]  pressure from below is getting the people into a state of brainwashing where they actually want
[02:29:53.840 --> 02:30:00.800]  to own nothing. They actually want to be kept as feudal slaves, living on the land, but actually
[02:30:00.800 --> 02:30:06.480]  having zero property rights. Actually, not even understanding the boundaries of property, so then
[02:30:06.480 --> 02:30:12.080]  even bodily autonomy doesn't matter. And your body isn't technically your property anymore,
[02:30:12.080 --> 02:30:16.640]  it's the property of the state. That's what slavery is, you know? And then they could just
[02:30:16.640 --> 02:30:22.240]  decide what you're going to put into your body at will. And you have no right to refuse, no free will
[02:30:22.240 --> 02:30:27.280]  to even refuse what can go into one's body, the loss of bodily autonomy. And we're seeing that
[02:30:27.280 --> 02:30:33.360]  in the aftermath of the so-called pandemic. So this is ultimately their long-term goal,
[02:30:33.360 --> 02:30:40.960]  neo feudalism. And the prefix neo means that it existed in the old world. It's just a new form
[02:30:40.960 --> 02:30:47.440]  of it. The new religion called government is just another variation of the old religion called
[02:30:47.440 --> 02:30:55.040]  kingship. It's no different. And that is the idea. That is the very shift in consciousness
[02:30:55.040 --> 02:31:02.480]  that mankind must learn if it is going to continue in its evolutionary development forward.
[02:31:02.480 --> 02:31:09.520]  The sticking point in our evolution as beings, in consciousness, I'm not talking about Darwinian
[02:31:09.520 --> 02:31:15.840]  evolution here. I'm talking about the evolution of human consciousness, the ability to recognize
[02:31:15.840 --> 02:31:22.400]  what is going on within us and around us, and in doing so to learn how the functions of both
[02:31:22.400 --> 02:31:29.760]  our psyche and the laws of nature actually work in reality, inherently in reality, to then optimize
[02:31:29.760 --> 02:31:36.640]  our progress as a species forward into the future. They are attempting to completely
[02:31:36.640 --> 02:31:43.360]  shut that down and stifle it. They don't want the movement of consciousness forward because
[02:31:43.360 --> 02:31:49.600]  if people recognize their own inherent sovereignty and recognize the pure illegitimacy
[02:31:49.600 --> 02:31:56.160]  of human authority over others, then that progress would be made. That's why they have to keep us
[02:31:56.160 --> 02:32:00.960]  in a state of thrall. They need to keep us in a state of mind control. They need to keep us
[02:32:00.960 --> 02:32:10.000]  accepting that the inherent coercion, duress and violence of the state of government is
[02:32:10.720 --> 02:32:14.160]  necessary and must continue because there would be chaos without it.
[02:32:14.160 --> 02:32:21.280]  So, Mark, you're philosophically laying out the skeleton and the muscles and the guts
[02:32:21.280 --> 02:32:25.760]  and the brain and the bones and the skin, and people don't do that. It's important you do that,
[02:32:25.760 --> 02:32:30.240]  but just I wanted to get you on. You're doing a great job, but I want to get you on specifically
[02:32:30.240 --> 02:32:37.040]  just as a human on this planet with Vladimir Putin, Xi Jinping, the New World Order. What next
[02:32:37.040 --> 02:32:40.880]  move you think they'll pull? Because you're a really smart guy. Super respect to you. So let's
[02:32:40.880 --> 02:32:45.840]  just, for a few minutes here, humor me. And what do you think is going to happen with this election
[02:32:45.840 --> 02:32:50.400]  in 10 days? What do you think of the Ukraine war? There's different factions in the globalist. Who
[02:32:50.400 --> 02:32:54.240]  do you think those factions are right now? Because I really respect your view. I want to see what you
[02:32:54.240 --> 02:32:59.840]  think. Just I understand if we get the basics of how they program us, we'll defeat them. That's
[02:32:59.840 --> 02:33:04.800]  important, but people are also very interested to hear your views just on the current wars that are
[02:33:04.800 --> 02:33:11.200]  happening. Oh, absolutely. I mean, they're all done to completely destabilize whole regions of
[02:33:11.200 --> 02:33:19.920]  the planet. They're done to waste human resources to keep people in a state of a basic, you know,
[02:33:22.000 --> 02:33:27.920]  baseline subsistence, subsistence, agree totally. Their goal is to keep us as serfs on the edge of
[02:33:27.920 --> 02:33:33.760]  subsistence. That's right. And, you know, with the election coming up, I would not doubt that
[02:33:33.760 --> 02:33:41.280]  there would be continued fraud regarding that. They want to push for continued dichotomy between
[02:33:41.280 --> 02:33:46.880]  left and right here in America so that people are always at each other's throats on the lines of
[02:33:46.880 --> 02:33:53.120]  political basis, which is like basically saying, you know, I'm going to hate the person next door
[02:33:53.120 --> 02:33:58.000]  to me because they're picking a different master. You know, that's really all it ultimately amounts
[02:33:58.000 --> 02:34:02.880]  to. So, you know, I definitely do not think the solution comes through voting. I understand
[02:34:02.880 --> 02:34:07.360]  that people want to know that we shouldn't hate each other over like, well, I know Lester Teebles
[02:34:07.360 --> 02:34:13.120]  is a fraud, but I'm trying to pick a better master. We shouldn't be killing each other over what
[02:34:13.120 --> 02:34:19.280]  political party. Right. And that's what they want. It's about polarizing people. It's about
[02:34:19.280 --> 02:34:24.160]  bringing people into deep polarization with each other so that they're always fighting each other.
[02:34:24.160 --> 02:34:29.040]  That's the dialectic. The dialectic pits two forces against each other. And ultimately,
[02:34:29.040 --> 02:34:33.360]  a synthesis is created. So no matter who you vote for, you're voting for government. You're
[02:34:33.360 --> 02:34:38.480]  voting for the continuation of. And no matter what you do, authoritarianism continues to march.
[02:34:39.200 --> 02:34:44.480]  That's right. And, you know, this is the entire idea that that's the pressure from below. They
[02:34:44.480 --> 02:34:48.400]  want the people to support their own enslavement. They want the people to continue to believe in
[02:34:48.400 --> 02:34:52.320]  authority. They want the people to continue to believe that as long as their political party
[02:34:52.320 --> 02:34:57.040]  gets in, they're somehow going to be all right. And they're going to be cared for. And, you know,
[02:34:57.040 --> 02:35:02.960]  things are going to work out. But it's all just a facade. But then Trump comes along and they
[02:35:02.960 --> 02:35:08.640]  totally flip out. Or was that meant to just energize the left? I don't think Trump even knows
[02:35:08.640 --> 02:35:13.120]  the manipulation he's involved in. Is the establishment fundamentally really upset with
[02:35:13.120 --> 02:35:19.280]  Trump? Or are they using that as another haggling and dialectic? I believe it was a dialectical
[02:35:19.280 --> 02:35:24.720]  schism that they were putting in place there. You know, not to say that perhaps if Trump really
[02:35:24.720 --> 02:35:31.280]  did his job, that maybe he could have slowed their agenda. Hold their whole places you're dead on.
[02:35:31.280 --> 02:35:35.840]  They created the internet. They admit to control us and track us. Now they're upset. We're using it.
[02:35:35.840 --> 02:35:41.200]  So they're not God. They're not all powerful. If we, like you said, pull back and see the dialectic,
[02:35:41.200 --> 02:35:47.760]  we can now not manipulate like they do, but be aware of the construct and it has a lot less power.
[02:35:48.560 --> 02:35:54.080]  That's exactly right. I tell people all the time when a dialectic is constructed, which means you're
[02:35:54.080 --> 02:35:59.440]  creating two opposing forces to ultimately bring about something that you wanted to create as a
[02:35:59.440 --> 02:36:07.520]  synthesis all along. When you do that, unfortunately, only one side really needs to be manipulated.
[02:36:07.520 --> 02:36:12.640]  Okay. So you look at the example, perhaps of World War Two, right? They're going to create
[02:36:12.640 --> 02:36:17.920]  fascism in Italy and Germany and they're going to put Germans under 20 years of sanctions,
[02:36:17.920 --> 02:36:22.640]  piss them off, put in a British Intel controlled asset. He attacks you. You don't have a choice
[02:36:22.640 --> 02:36:26.640]  to fight back, but it's the dialectic, but still both sides were being manipulated.
[02:36:27.200 --> 02:36:34.000]  Yes, exactly. And if one side runs rampant with the manipulation, as Germany did under Hitler,
[02:36:34.000 --> 02:36:39.920]  and then starts, you know, destroying, you know, other nations and taking people as his slaves,
[02:36:40.880 --> 02:36:46.320]  you can't say, oh, just let that happen, right? People are going to have to step in and do
[02:36:46.320 --> 02:36:49.120]  something about it. The globalists are good at forcing us into those positions.
[02:36:49.120 --> 02:36:54.000]  Exactly. And we don't back up British Empire. We don't back to Democratic Party,
[02:36:54.000 --> 02:36:58.480]  but Hitler's blowing us up. So they force us, they can script us by the situation.
[02:36:59.360 --> 02:37:06.160]  Exactly. And you know, what can you do? You know, if you're under attack, you can't just sit back
[02:37:06.160 --> 02:37:12.560]  and say, well, they're manipulated, you know, you know, I look at the example of even just,
[02:37:12.560 --> 02:37:19.520]  you know, modern policing, you know, which is an extension of things that, you know, human beings
[02:37:19.520 --> 02:37:26.080]  learned to manipulate and put people under, you know, mental conditions whereby they can't even
[02:37:26.080 --> 02:37:31.120]  see that they're really doing harm to other people, as was done in Nazi Germany. You know,
[02:37:31.120 --> 02:37:37.200]  what are people to do if, you know, a police state is forming? Just say, well, all these people are
[02:37:37.200 --> 02:37:43.760]  manipulated, we just have to lay down. You know, no, that's not the case. You know, so a polarization
[02:37:43.760 --> 02:37:51.120]  dialectic, unfortunately, is going to work unless both sides see the manipulation and do not fall
[02:37:51.120 --> 02:37:55.440]  prey to it. Even if one, if both sides, of course, it's going to be the most powerful, you're going
[02:37:55.440 --> 02:37:59.840]  to have the most polarization. And so here's a modern example, with Tulsi Gabbards and others
[02:37:59.840 --> 02:38:05.360]  and Democrats protesting leftist being pro war, we're starting to see the left and right
[02:38:05.360 --> 02:38:09.680]  being against the Ukraine war. Not saying it's going to succeed, but that's what the establishment
[02:38:09.680 --> 02:38:16.400]  really fears. They don't want peace because peace doesn't really help them. They want conflict,
[02:38:16.400 --> 02:38:23.360]  they want strife, they want division. And that's why they're manipulating wars. People have to see
[02:38:23.360 --> 02:38:31.120]  that government manipulated wars, government inspired wars are never moral wars. Ultimately,
[02:38:31.120 --> 02:38:37.600]  it comes down to that. The only kind of a moral righteous war is one that's truly waged in the
[02:38:37.600 --> 02:38:43.280]  name of real freedom. The American Revolution was one of those wars, what I would consider a
[02:38:43.280 --> 02:38:49.840]  righteous war. And I don't think we've really even had any others other than perhaps World War II,
[02:38:49.840 --> 02:38:56.320]  because obviously, you know, we needed intervention in Europe and, you know, to stop the spread of
[02:38:56.320 --> 02:39:03.600]  Nazism. So that's another war that qualifies as a righteous war. But ultimately, humanity has to
[02:39:03.600 --> 02:39:09.840]  stop being manipulable. And that means rising to a level of consciousness where you can see the
[02:39:09.840 --> 02:39:17.760]  methodology by which these globalists and occultists ultimately are waging cy war against people. We
[02:39:17.760 --> 02:39:24.080]  have to understand their methods. This is why a lot of people love my work because I expose that.
[02:39:24.080 --> 02:39:30.320]  And a lot of people don't like it because they'll say, why are you teaching the mentality of
[02:39:30.320 --> 02:39:34.240]  the enemy? Because if you don't understand the mentality of the enemy, how could you ever hope
[02:39:34.240 --> 02:39:39.680]  to defeat them? This is the... Well, that's a paradox I wrote into is that I've explained how
[02:39:39.680 --> 02:39:45.120]  the new order works in their basic psychology from a layman's perspective. And then I realized
[02:39:45.120 --> 02:39:50.000]  some people I went meant to wake up, realized it and join the enemy. But that's a free will choice.
[02:39:50.000 --> 02:39:55.360]  That's right. Justice be done, may the heavens fall. We just tell the truth. And then I'm not
[02:39:55.360 --> 02:40:00.800]  going to sit there and like, just try to make sure everybody falls my view. That's just part of the
[02:40:00.800 --> 02:40:06.320]  paradox. That's exactly right. That's all that we can do. We can decult that information and we
[02:40:06.320 --> 02:40:12.400]  could put it out there in an egalitarian fashion for people's consideration. And then they have
[02:40:12.400 --> 02:40:16.560]  to take it in. They have to analyze it. They have to make up their own mind about it. You know,
[02:40:16.560 --> 02:40:23.600]  as you were saying before, ultimately, when this country was formed, you know, people like Franklin
[02:40:23.600 --> 02:40:32.400]  and Washington and Jefferson all basically said that this was only going to be a state of existence
[02:40:32.400 --> 02:40:40.240]  that could be sustained by a moral people. Morality is the ultimate building block. If you don't
[02:40:40.240 --> 02:40:45.440]  build upon a moral foundation, everything that you build on top of that foundation ultimately
[02:40:45.440 --> 02:40:52.480]  cannot stand. So the ultimate choice that we have that as I see it, the time period that we are in
[02:40:52.480 --> 02:40:59.840]  is a time period of cosmic judgment. It's a time period of cosmic justice and consequence. And we're
[02:40:59.840 --> 02:41:08.000]  being given a choice. Okay, in my work, in my introduction to my podcast series, the narrator
[02:41:08.000 --> 02:41:14.800]  says, we are approaching our critical moment of choice, words to that effect. And that choice
[02:41:14.800 --> 02:41:22.400]  is here before us now. The choice is we wake up to the understanding of what true morality is and
[02:41:22.400 --> 02:41:29.600]  how authority is actually an immoral illusion. It is a state that we should not condone because it
[02:41:29.600 --> 02:41:35.280]  is based in violence. It's based in coercion. It's based in the destruction of free will,
[02:41:35.280 --> 02:41:42.480]  which is the ultimate gift of the Creator Almighty. Okay, and once we decide to make that choice and
[02:41:42.480 --> 02:41:48.080]  elevate our consciousness into true moral understanding of natural law, of the laws of the
[02:41:48.080 --> 02:41:54.400]  Creator, we will create a positive outcome. We will be able to transcend the current human
[02:41:54.400 --> 02:41:58.400]  condition. So we have to be the little examples in our own life. Because when I look at Satanist
[02:41:58.960 --> 02:42:02.720]  and people that serve even though they're super powerful or low level, they look enslaved,
[02:42:02.720 --> 02:42:06.880]  they look disempowered, they look like wraiths. When I see people like you and others that are
[02:42:06.880 --> 02:42:12.160]  like, you're alive, you're vibrant, you're well spoken, you're smart, you're amazing. I mean, judge the
[02:42:12.160 --> 02:42:18.160]  tree by its fruits. This satanic system doesn't pay in the end. So why are there so many people
[02:42:18.160 --> 02:42:25.840]  serving it? And from your deep research, is there a evil, offworld force, interdimensional?
[02:42:25.840 --> 02:42:31.680]  I mean, what is this entity entities? What is it? So I would say the people become
[02:42:31.680 --> 02:42:42.880]  ensnared by the satanic mindset because they have internal psychological, emotional, and spiritual
[02:42:42.880 --> 02:42:49.040]  failures that they have not developed yet developed the spiritual strength to confront.
[02:42:49.040 --> 02:42:53.120]  And that's why they trauma based mind control children is to break them so they can be programmable.
[02:42:53.120 --> 02:43:03.920]  Exactly. Trauma is the key to putting people into the underlying satanic ideology, which is
[02:43:03.920 --> 02:43:11.360]  essentially, I only ultimately care about myself, my own comfort, and perhaps the comfort and well
[02:43:11.360 --> 02:43:17.520]  being of my own, my immediate family members, my friends, and that's it. And everybody else,
[02:43:17.520 --> 02:43:22.240]  be damned. I'm not going to worry about whether their rights are being taken. I'm not going to
[02:43:22.240 --> 02:43:26.880]  worry about whether they're oppressed. I'm not going to worry about any issues of real justice.
[02:43:26.880 --> 02:43:32.080]  And that's what the left's doing, censoring and corrupting and dominating. And they feel like
[02:43:32.080 --> 02:43:35.440]  as minions, they're being empowered, even though their own rights are being destroyed.
[02:43:36.160 --> 02:43:42.960]  Could you imagine how much of a degraded husk spiritually one must be to want to silence
[02:43:42.960 --> 02:43:48.800]  somebody else's freedom of expression? What they did to you, Alex, was an absolute travesty.
[02:43:48.800 --> 02:43:53.920]  It's the exact inversion of justice, which is what Satanism wishes to create.
[02:43:53.920 --> 02:44:02.000]  True justice is the ultimate power of the universe. That is the creator's way that it ultimately
[02:44:02.960 --> 02:44:10.320]  brings consequence to the entire world of beings that have the capacity for understanding the
[02:44:10.320 --> 02:44:16.000]  difference between right and wrong. That's what cosmic justice is. And could you imagine
[02:44:16.000 --> 02:44:22.080]  just picture being the kind of person that says, well, I don't agree with what you said. Now,
[02:44:22.080 --> 02:44:27.280]  we might not agree with radical leftists, communists, Nazis, fascists, etc. Of course,
[02:44:27.280 --> 02:44:34.400]  we don't. We want freedom. We want humanity to move to the next level of development and build
[02:44:34.400 --> 02:44:41.840]  something that we can even scarcely imagine and move on to greatness. And what these people want
[02:44:41.840 --> 02:44:46.400]  is to degrade the human condition, to keep it in slavery, to keep people down, to keep people
[02:44:46.400 --> 02:44:50.400]  out of base, common denominator level and ultimately enslave them. And I think what you're
[02:44:50.400 --> 02:44:57.120]  saying is, sorry, I'll finish up and I'll have it some day. Yeah, I was saying, even if they endorse
[02:44:57.120 --> 02:45:02.160]  those things, imagine us having so little confidence in what we're saying that we say,
[02:45:02.800 --> 02:45:07.680]  we need to shut down their speech. They can't say that, silence them, take them. Well, that's
[02:45:07.680 --> 02:45:12.720]  exactly where I was going. This universal truth, you know, we didn't talk before you came on about
[02:45:12.720 --> 02:45:18.400]  what we were talking about, is that I'm confident my ideas, I believe my ideas against theirs will
[02:45:18.400 --> 02:45:23.440]  defeat them, which they will. That's why they've got to shut us down. So theirs is the only option.
[02:45:24.640 --> 02:45:31.120]  Absolutely, exactly correct. They know that ultimately they do not have a true legitimate
[02:45:31.120 --> 02:45:36.480]  argument. They don't have an argument factually, they don't even and they certainly don't have an
[02:45:36.480 --> 02:45:43.440]  argument morally. So the only answer is, we have to stop any alternative narratives and any
[02:45:43.440 --> 02:45:49.200]  alternative communication from reaching people's eyes and ears, so that we can continue to brainwashed
[02:45:49.200 --> 02:45:54.080]  them into our psychology, and they can't hear anything that opposes it. That is ultimately
[02:45:54.080 --> 02:45:58.800]  what they are trying to do with the shutdown of freedom of expression and censorship, which shows
[02:45:58.800 --> 02:46:04.000]  how incredibly weak they are. But then it falls to us to not submit into fight even harder. And I
[02:46:04.000 --> 02:46:08.000]  found when we don't give up and fight even harder, people instinctively get it and we just get bigger.
[02:46:09.280 --> 02:46:13.920]  Without a doubt. And that's why I feel it's so important for people to communicate. If there's
[02:46:13.920 --> 02:46:19.440]  no communication, there's no real learning. And we have to understand people need to unlearn
[02:46:19.440 --> 02:46:25.280]  things and they need to learn new things that ultimately make sense, that ultimately are based
[02:46:25.280 --> 02:46:33.920]  in true justice, that are ultimately based in real freedom. And the only way to spread those ideas
[02:46:33.920 --> 02:46:39.360]  is through communication. And through modern communication, meaning digital communication,
[02:46:39.360 --> 02:46:44.320]  communication over the internet in forms of many different forms of multimedia,
[02:46:44.320 --> 02:46:50.960]  is going to be the method that will optimally get that message out to the maximum number of people.
[02:46:50.960 --> 02:46:55.360]  Word of mouth, of course, is okay. I'm not telling people not to speak to their neighbors or friends
[02:46:55.360 --> 02:47:01.760]  or family members. You have to do that too. But one of the crux is that the main tenets of my work
[02:47:01.760 --> 02:47:06.960]  in particular is we have to learn modern communication and become the new media. We have
[02:47:06.960 --> 02:47:12.880]  to become the modern, not only truth seekers, but the modern truth speakers. We have to put the word
[02:47:12.880 --> 02:47:18.400]  out. Just us learning and knowing all this stuff is not good enough. That's the first step. That's
[02:47:18.400 --> 02:47:24.160]  the first step. That's transforming the self, right? But after the self is transformed, then you have
[02:47:24.160 --> 02:47:30.560]  to become an influencer and a person who helps to elevate consciousness in others. And that is
[02:47:30.560 --> 02:47:35.280]  accomplished through communication. That's why we have to become effective communicators. We have
[02:47:35.280 --> 02:47:43.120]  to become people who can put our word out there in a very powerful way, in a confident way, in a
[02:47:43.120 --> 02:47:49.440]  way that is logically expressed and logically oriented for people so that they can easily
[02:47:49.440 --> 02:47:54.480]  take it in and understand it. And we have to know the technology, how to do it. That's the big
[02:47:54.480 --> 02:47:59.440]  sticking point for most people. A lot of people don't want to learn computing. A lot of people
[02:47:59.440 --> 02:48:06.400]  don't want to learn modern digital communication and digital media creation. They're loath to that
[02:48:06.400 --> 02:48:11.120]  because for whatever reason, they don't think that that's really necessary or that they have
[02:48:11.120 --> 02:48:17.040]  to get personally involved in that. My work tries to help them to understand you not only have to
[02:48:17.040 --> 02:48:22.400]  know this stuff yourself and just speak it to family members, friends, etc. You should try to
[02:48:22.400 --> 02:48:28.240]  get involved in media creation yourself, even if it's only to point a phone at your face and hit
[02:48:28.240 --> 02:48:33.920]  upload. That's the minimum that people can do. If we learn a little bit more, we can have nice
[02:48:33.920 --> 02:48:38.960]  production values, nice graphics, etc. It makes it a little bit easier for people to take in. It
[02:48:38.960 --> 02:48:45.360]  makes it attractive for them to watch. This is what I advocate for. This is what I teach. It's
[02:48:45.360 --> 02:48:49.520]  not just learning the moral part of it. That obviously has to be the foundation. That has
[02:48:49.520 --> 02:48:55.040]  to come first. But then it becomes our moral obligation to communicate this out to other
[02:48:55.040 --> 02:49:02.480]  people. I think a lot of people miss that second part. They think that just only certain people
[02:49:02.480 --> 02:49:06.800]  and certain influencers have to do that. Stop right there. Stop right there because I was about
[02:49:06.800 --> 02:49:11.520]  to interrupt you two minutes ago and wrote the note right here. Little people have to think
[02:49:11.520 --> 02:49:16.640]  they're big people because I'm so sick of everybody thinking a leader is going to do it.
[02:49:16.640 --> 02:49:19.760]  When Lister's calling and say, oh, Alex, thank you. We love you. I'm like, listen,
[02:49:20.320 --> 02:49:24.720]  you donate, you buy products. I love you. I'm like a guy thrown in the ocean. You're a piece
[02:49:24.720 --> 02:49:31.440]  of driftwood. We're together. Thank you. I need you to move past just supporting us. Go speak at
[02:49:31.440 --> 02:49:36.480]  City Council. Take the first step or school board or put a YouTube up. So who cares if it gets five
[02:49:36.480 --> 02:49:42.240]  views? The point is that's how the journey starts. And we have to get the general public to realize
[02:49:42.240 --> 02:49:48.720]  that just like Thomas Jefferson said, we must get the yeoman farmer engaged in education
[02:49:48.720 --> 02:49:55.200]  and how the universe works and in metaphysics. And that's what he said. And to get outside the
[02:49:55.200 --> 02:50:02.160]  box because the yeoman farmer was the lowest level blue collar person and white collar person,
[02:50:02.160 --> 02:50:06.880]  middle class, poor middle class that were self sufficient. And he said this will only work
[02:50:06.880 --> 02:50:12.240]  when the general public knows these systems. If we don't have these, he wrote about it extensively
[02:50:12.240 --> 02:50:15.920]  as you know, and we're right back to Thomas Jefferson, we've got to get the average man and
[02:50:15.920 --> 02:50:20.080]  woman to realize they don't have to save the world and have to be Mark Pascio and reach 10
[02:50:20.080 --> 02:50:25.760]  million people a week for Alex Jones. They've just got to engage. And when that happens and the
[02:50:25.760 --> 02:50:32.080]  general consciousness gets off the bench, it's game over for the controllers. Without a doubt,
[02:50:32.080 --> 02:50:38.480]  well, well said, you know, people have to step into their own power and realize that they are
[02:50:38.480 --> 02:50:47.040]  not powerless. People will often ask, what can I do? What can one person do? And the answer is a whole
[02:50:47.040 --> 02:50:51.440]  Well, you talk about quantum mechanics, which is proven, which they've done thousands of times
[02:50:51.440 --> 02:50:55.280]  now at different universities, they can't believe it. When they observe a particle at x one way,
[02:50:55.280 --> 02:51:01.280]  when they don't at x another, we are literally moving particles at the lowest level. But but
[02:51:01.280 --> 02:51:06.640]  again, and then it's like a cyclotron or an amplification, the more you realize you have
[02:51:06.640 --> 02:51:12.000]  that power, it becomes scary. How much power we got? It's the butterfly effect, as they call it.
[02:51:12.800 --> 02:51:21.040]  We have unimaginable influence if we set our mind to it. If we decide I am going to speak,
[02:51:21.040 --> 02:51:26.240]  I am going to help others to learn, I'm going to be a communicator, I'm going to be an influencer.
[02:51:26.880 --> 02:51:33.280]  You cannot imagine what kind of power lies in that. That's the power of the human mind,
[02:51:33.280 --> 02:51:40.000]  then sending out the voice to other people. It's action at a distance. There is no better
[02:51:40.000 --> 02:51:46.080]  definition as far as I am concerned for the concept of magic, literally. That's what these
[02:51:46.080 --> 02:51:51.600]  occultists understand. That's why they do their television broadcast, right? We're doing our
[02:51:51.600 --> 02:51:58.480]  broadcast. We're casting a influence spell, you could say, right? It's putting out word for
[02:51:58.480 --> 02:52:04.400]  action at a distance. Think about how powerful it is that we can speak. That information that we
[02:52:04.400 --> 02:52:08.560]  speak into existence can be carried over technology. And what do they tell us? Humans are dirty.
[02:52:08.560 --> 02:52:11.840]  Humans are killing the earth. You don't have power. You should kill yourself. You're a worthless
[02:52:11.840 --> 02:52:18.960]  piece of crap. Meanwhile, worship Bill Gates, worship Harari, worship Klaus Schwab. No, they
[02:52:18.960 --> 02:52:22.960]  tell us how great they are in this great vision they've got, which is the end of us. We need to
[02:52:22.960 --> 02:52:28.320]  stand up and say, I'm made of the image of God, little G. That's right. And the Old Testament
[02:52:28.320 --> 02:52:32.960]  tells us, and it's true that what you envision is built, it may not happen even in this generation,
[02:52:32.960 --> 02:52:37.760]  but now we've reached this launch pad where basically whatever we want to do now can be
[02:52:37.760 --> 02:52:42.720]  done. And they know that, and they're so jealous of us being able to actually have the keys of the
[02:52:42.720 --> 02:52:48.880]  future. That's what they want to shut down. They want to shut down humanity's potentially
[02:52:48.880 --> 02:52:57.040]  very, very positive progress into the future. They want to stagnate that. And as I was saying,
[02:52:57.680 --> 02:53:03.280]  people have to step into that power and realize, what is more powerful than being able to speak?
[02:53:03.280 --> 02:53:09.200]  Have your words carried over some form of digital media of communication. And then it
[02:53:09.200 --> 02:53:16.320]  reach another person. It reach their mind. It influences their thoughts. It helps them to improve
[02:53:16.320 --> 02:53:23.360]  themselves and improve their lives. That is so, so powerful. It's unbelievably powerful.
[02:53:23.360 --> 02:53:29.520]  And these globalists, these transhumanists, these sick social engineers, these psychopathic, satanic
[02:53:29.520 --> 02:53:35.520]  social engineers want to block that. They don't want us exercising that power because then we're
[02:53:35.520 --> 02:53:41.040]  going to realize we're nobody's rightful slave. And we're going to realize we can create a positive
[02:53:41.040 --> 02:53:47.280]  outcome. We can create a positive future. It is possible. It has to be chosen. And it has to be
[02:53:47.280 --> 02:53:54.160]  willfully enacted through an act of our willpower. We have to stop being lazy about it. We have to
[02:53:54.160 --> 02:53:58.720]  stop being apathetic about it as a species. We have to get involved. We have to get on board. We
[02:53:58.720 --> 02:54:04.160]  have to step into the arena. We have to step onto the battlefield. We have to be that person in the
[02:54:04.160 --> 02:54:10.240]  arena. Okay. And step into that power. And then we're going to see exactly what we are capable
[02:54:10.240 --> 02:54:15.120]  of doing. And let me expand on that because, you know, you're a guy that never tended to do this
[02:54:15.120 --> 02:54:19.200]  and you reach tens of millions. I'm the same way. And I'm always telling listeners, you could be the
[02:54:19.200 --> 02:54:23.520]  next person to break the matrix. And that's why the globalists are so scared of this broadcast
[02:54:23.520 --> 02:54:28.960]  and your broadcast is we're empowering people and saying you're not ugly. You're not bad. You're not
[02:54:28.960 --> 02:54:34.320]  fallen. They want to keep you in that state only by dialing into their energy or that God, the
[02:54:34.320 --> 02:54:38.880]  universe that God created has a plan for you. But God's free will, you've got to follow the
[02:54:38.880 --> 02:54:43.520]  natural law. You've got to have the will. You've got to not hurt other people in that project
[02:54:43.520 --> 02:54:47.520]  and try to empower people. And it's like a video game. The more you empower people,
[02:54:47.520 --> 02:54:52.480]  the stronger you get. I mean, I've been on here 28 years and I was reaching millions of people
[02:54:52.480 --> 02:54:57.280]  in my first few years and then tens of millions and then now hundreds of millions if not billions.
[02:54:57.280 --> 02:55:01.600]  And the key to it all was I realized it was all a test. I didn't let it go to my head when they
[02:55:01.600 --> 02:55:05.920]  came and tried to buy me off and stuff. But as long as you're humble and realize it's part of a
[02:55:05.920 --> 02:55:10.880]  larger program, it's, it's, it's limitless. So that's why we harp so much not to tell viewers
[02:55:10.880 --> 02:55:15.280]  and listeners, oh, you're so great. Oh, you're so wonderful. No, you really are amazing,
[02:55:15.280 --> 02:55:19.040]  but you've got to get in sync with God with the natural law.
[02:55:20.160 --> 02:55:25.680]  Without a doubt, that's the underlying knowledge that has to be the foundation. If people don't
[02:55:25.680 --> 02:55:34.960]  understand moral law, that is the driving force of justice in creation. Justice is the ultimate
[02:55:34.960 --> 02:55:42.400]  expression of God, I would say. I see, if I had to give my, you know, impression or current
[02:55:42.400 --> 02:55:49.360]  understanding of what the Creator really is, it's law. It is law in the universe. And that's a
[02:55:49.360 --> 02:55:54.480]  strange definition for a lot of people because they look at it as a more personalized force
[02:55:54.480 --> 02:55:58.720]  many people do, especially, but that's how the God of the Israelites appeared as the law.
[02:55:58.720 --> 02:56:08.880]  Exactly. You know, and that moral law is going to basically act as the guiding foundation for
[02:56:09.440 --> 02:56:14.720]  what we experienced through consequence. We see the universal. I'm going to shut up and give you
[02:56:14.720 --> 02:56:18.240]  the last 10 minutes here, but I'm going to interrupt you. It's so important, not the false
[02:56:18.240 --> 02:56:23.440]  courts and system. Remember, the worldly corrupt system always creates a counterfeit. That's a
[02:56:23.440 --> 02:56:28.080]  fraud. People say the law, that's a fraud. No, no, we mean universal law. Explain this to them.
[02:56:28.080 --> 02:56:33.440]  I'm going to shut up. Yes. So I'm not referring to man's law here. When I say natural law, I mean
[02:56:33.440 --> 02:56:43.360]  God's law. I mean the universal, non-manmade, inherent to nature conditions that are eternal,
[02:56:43.360 --> 02:56:49.840]  that are objective, that are absolutely immutable, meaning they cannot be changed. So they're
[02:56:49.840 --> 02:56:54.640]  eternal. They're unchangeable. They're non-manmade. They're created by the Creator of the universe.
[02:56:54.640 --> 02:56:59.920]  They're inherent to nature. They're part of the universe, part of the fabric of creation,
[02:56:59.920 --> 02:57:06.560]  and they can never be taken out of existence. And they govern the consequences of our free will
[02:57:06.560 --> 02:57:13.360]  choices. It doesn't mean we don't have free will. We have free will to act, but then once we put our
[02:57:13.360 --> 02:57:20.000]  actions into effect in the universe, through our behavior, then we experience either positive
[02:57:20.000 --> 02:57:27.200]  consequence if those actions were in alignment with moral law, or we receive negative consequence
[02:57:27.200 --> 02:57:33.120]  if those actions are out of alignment and are transgressions against moral law. So the universe
[02:57:33.120 --> 02:57:44.160]  is one huge engine of choice, action, and consequence. We choose through what we have in our mental
[02:57:44.160 --> 02:57:50.400]  makeup, our psychology, our understanding. That comes from information that we take in, which is
[02:57:50.400 --> 02:57:56.320]  why information flow is so important. And that's why information has to, we have to have free access
[02:57:56.320 --> 02:58:02.880]  to it so we can make informed choices, informed decision making. Then we choose to behave. We
[02:58:02.880 --> 02:58:09.280]  behave a certain way, and then there are consequences attached to that behavior. And how I word it,
[02:58:09.280 --> 02:58:14.320]  I've actually written it as a mathematical equation, believe it or not. You know, I come from a somewhat
[02:58:14.320 --> 02:58:20.960]  scientific background. I attended Ivy League University for engineering. However, I've actually
[02:58:20.960 --> 02:58:32.080]  given this a very small equation. The sum of moral behavior is directly proportional to the sum
[02:58:32.080 --> 02:58:39.680]  of human freedom. That is how what we are experiencing in life, collectively, in the aggregate,
[02:58:39.680 --> 02:58:46.720]  as a species on this planet, as humanity, that is how natural law actually functions. The more
[02:58:46.720 --> 02:58:51.840]  moral people behave in the aggregate, the more freedom they have in the aggregate. As Thomas
[02:58:51.840 --> 02:58:58.640]  Jefferson said, only a moral people can be free. Exactly. You cannot ever separate the two things.
[02:58:58.640 --> 02:59:05.280]  The goal of all spirituality is freedom and higher levels of expression of consciousness.
[02:59:05.280 --> 02:59:12.480]  And that can only happen if we understand moral, natural law and align our behavior to it. And
[02:59:12.480 --> 02:59:17.920]  then we'll have freedom. And then freedom is the potential to create, to create ever greater systems,
[02:59:17.920 --> 02:59:24.320]  to create ever greater adventures for ourselves as a species. But we're only going to be able to do
[02:59:24.320 --> 02:59:31.280]  that and transcend the current human condition of slavery if we understand objective morality under
[02:59:31.280 --> 02:59:36.560]  natural law. This is the very basis of my main body of teachings. If people want to learn more
[02:59:36.560 --> 02:59:42.640]  about that in particular, I highly recommend that they watch my seminar called the Natural Law
[02:59:42.640 --> 02:59:47.760]  Seminar. Natural Law Seminar, if you just look for that, you can check that out on my website,
[02:59:47.760 --> 02:59:53.520]  waltonearthishappening.com in the videos section. I did an entire documentary about this called
[02:59:53.520 --> 02:59:59.120]  The Science of Natural Law. So those are the places that I would recommend that people would
[02:59:59.120 --> 03:00:05.440]  start if they want a basic understanding of natural law, moral law principles. But it's very
[03:00:05.440 --> 03:00:13.920]  simple. As morality increases, freedom increases. And as morality declines, freedom invariably and
[03:00:13.920 --> 03:00:19.840]  inevitably declines. So then all you have to do is look at the aggregate picture of the world,
[03:00:19.840 --> 03:00:26.400]  look at the aggregate picture of humanity. Are we free? No, we are not. What does that then mean?
[03:00:26.400 --> 03:00:33.200]  What must it mean by law? By law, it must mean that most people are not making the moral choices
[03:00:33.200 --> 03:00:39.600]  that they should be making. And again, you know, we want to encourage people to become good people.
[03:00:39.600 --> 03:00:44.400]  We want to encourage people to do what they know to be right. It doesn't necessarily mean that
[03:00:44.400 --> 03:00:48.720]  everybody lives up to those expectations. It doesn't mean that they're currently doing the
[03:00:48.720 --> 03:00:54.240]  right thing. So I can get kind of harsh on people, particularly in my podcast, I generally
[03:00:54.240 --> 03:00:59.680]  go a little bit easier in language when I'm on someone else's show out of pure respect, obviously.
[03:00:59.680 --> 03:01:04.560]  But when I'm doing my show... Go ahead, go ahead and let us all have it. Yeah, I mean...
[03:01:04.560 --> 03:01:10.560]  Two minutes, tell us what... I tell people that we as a species are not really currently that good
[03:01:10.560 --> 03:01:15.680]  of human beings. We are not... If we were very good human beings in the aggregate, truly,
[03:01:15.680 --> 03:01:22.560]  according to natural law, then we'd be free. See, beings that are not enacting, are not learning
[03:01:23.600 --> 03:01:28.960]  completely... There's an old saying my uncle would always give me. He said, you can't con an honest
[03:01:28.960 --> 03:01:36.560]  man. Only con artists buy into a con. We put ourselves in the prison. That's right. That's
[03:01:36.560 --> 03:01:44.480]  right. You know, we have... For the lie to be sold, people have to be willing to purchase it. They
[03:01:44.480 --> 03:01:50.000]  have to be willing to buy it. And this is what we are socially engineered and conditioned into.
[03:01:50.000 --> 03:01:55.280]  The lie is made attractive. It's packaged really nicely, right? And then they sell it to people
[03:01:55.280 --> 03:02:01.680]  over their brand of media, over their controlled corporate media and state-run media. And then,
[03:02:01.680 --> 03:02:05.600]  unfortunately, people watch it and take it into themselves and make it a part of their thought
[03:02:05.600 --> 03:02:10.240]  processes. This is what has to fundamentally change. So Mark, let me ask you this in close. It's been
[03:02:10.240 --> 03:02:14.800]  an amazing hour and you got to go soon. This has been a three-plus hour emergency transmission.
[03:02:14.800 --> 03:02:18.480]  Let me ask you this question, just without getting into natural law, which is amazing and
[03:02:18.480 --> 03:02:24.240]  you're absolutely right. Big picture, humanity sliding into the abyss. But I agree with you,
[03:02:24.240 --> 03:02:29.280]  but I do see a big awakening happening. What is your prognosis or your weather forecast for the
[03:02:29.280 --> 03:02:33.760]  near future, medium future, long-term future? I know it's all speculation, but you're a smart
[03:02:33.760 --> 03:02:37.600]  guy. I really want your view on this. Please give it to us. What do you see happening to humanity?
[03:02:37.600 --> 03:02:45.920]  Well, I see nothing as completely set in stone. We have free will. We have free will choice to
[03:02:45.920 --> 03:02:51.280]  choose our behavior. Our behaviors are going to be chosen based upon what we know. So I see two
[03:02:52.160 --> 03:02:55.920]  inevitable potentials that it can only really go two ways.
[03:02:55.920 --> 03:02:58.000]  So we're at the fork in the road. We're at the fork in the road.
[03:02:58.800 --> 03:03:03.040]  Absolutely. This is the critical moment of choice, the fork in the road for humanity,
[03:03:03.040 --> 03:03:09.840]  for our evolutionary development into the future. Either we learn moral, objective,
[03:03:09.840 --> 03:03:17.280]  natural law, and we then align our behavior to those moral principles. And we're going to create
[03:03:17.280 --> 03:03:23.520]  an incredibly positive future that will become a type I civilization. If we do that, I've predicted
[03:03:24.160 --> 03:03:31.920]  humanity will be a type I civilization on the Kardashev scale of civilizations within 100 years,
[03:03:31.920 --> 03:03:41.840]  one century. I predict if we get rid of the ideas and the false religions about authority and about
[03:03:41.840 --> 03:03:47.840]  rulership of people over others that don't serve who we are whatsoever. Now, if we don't do that,
[03:03:47.840 --> 03:03:52.800]  and that's the path, unfortunately, that we're on right now, we're on the negative path right now.
[03:03:52.800 --> 03:03:58.240]  If things continue as they have been, and they do not change drastically in the form of human
[03:03:58.240 --> 03:04:05.040]  understanding of moral law, then we are going to go into such a degraded state that I would predict
[03:04:05.680 --> 03:04:11.680]  within a few hundred years, we're going to be in a situation as predicted by HG Wells and the
[03:04:11.680 --> 03:04:18.800]  time machine between the the more more lock and the Eloy, the Eloy and more lock. Yes. And it will
[03:04:18.800 --> 03:04:25.840]  be like that scenario, where we will have a predator class that is literally devouring people,
[03:04:25.840 --> 03:04:32.320]  it will be it will get that. So it's a soil and green program. It will go there if we don't stop it.
[03:04:33.120 --> 03:04:39.760]  The positive news is we have free will. We have choice. We can learn natural law. It is not
[03:04:39.760 --> 03:04:45.920]  undiscoverable. It is absolutely learnable. It is discoverable. We can understand how it operates,
[03:04:45.920 --> 03:04:50.560]  and then we can choose more wise. No, no, I agree. Let me just throw this out there.
[03:04:50.560 --> 03:04:57.120]  I don't say this to my horn or anything. It's just a fact. I have world leaders calling top people
[03:04:57.120 --> 03:05:02.880]  at every level podcasting music, you name it, you know, tech heads, I've had dinner with them,
[03:05:03.440 --> 03:05:09.280]  and they, and I don't think they're trying to manipulate me. I don't think they're there
[03:05:09.280 --> 03:05:12.720]  for me to feel important because they're not asking me to do anything. They're saying,
[03:05:12.720 --> 03:05:17.040]  what do we do? We don't want to be part of this, but we're captured at what's your advice. So
[03:05:17.040 --> 03:05:22.000]  the globalists are digging armored bunkers around the world. They're hiding on an underground basis.
[03:05:22.000 --> 03:05:26.480]  They know what they've done is not working, but they don't know how to get off the system. So I see
[03:05:26.480 --> 03:05:32.320]  the fact that so many, even of their top practitioners are trying to find a way out, show salvation
[03:05:33.040 --> 03:05:40.560]  in the final equation. It's very simple. Learn natural law because good behavior results in
[03:05:40.560 --> 03:05:46.160]  positive consequence. Good behavior can turn the situation around. It means you have to stop being
[03:05:46.160 --> 03:05:51.600]  selfish. Well, as an example, let's say Elon Musk is for real. Let's say Elon Musk is for real.
[03:05:51.600 --> 03:05:56.560]  I think the jury's out. If he can set up internet access open and free again, he'll be the biggest
[03:05:56.560 --> 03:06:01.840]  guy ever. So natural law, open it up, make it free. You'll run the, you'll be the king of it.
[03:06:02.560 --> 03:06:07.040]  Without a doubt, I think he should explore trying to even replace something like PayPal,
[03:06:07.040 --> 03:06:11.920]  which has become a horrific control freak organization based on censorship and
[03:06:11.920 --> 03:06:19.280]  de-platforming and de-banking people. I'd like to see if Musk truly comes through with a platform
[03:06:19.280 --> 03:06:25.360]  of open and free communication, which again, does remain to be seen. I think he should move into
[03:06:25.360 --> 03:06:29.200]  trying to undo some of the evils of what PayPal has to do.
[03:06:29.200 --> 03:06:34.640]  Well, I can tell you, he said that's his plan. InternetX is free, open banking that doesn't
[03:06:34.640 --> 03:06:39.120]  control you, communication, everything. As long as you're not calling for violence. And
[03:06:39.120 --> 03:06:43.840]  I would, and even if he's not a perfect person, which he obviously isn't, he can see the alternative
[03:06:43.840 --> 03:06:48.800]  freedom is a trillion times better than slavery. Why would you want to be this big, rich mogul
[03:06:48.800 --> 03:06:54.400]  over a stinking, radioactive ashy? Well, why would you not want to stabilize stuff?
[03:06:54.400 --> 03:07:00.080]  I think that's my final question. Why are the current controllers bringing in a system that
[03:07:00.080 --> 03:07:04.480]  they know will destroy them? It's kind of how we started the interview because I'm not a rocket
[03:07:04.480 --> 03:07:10.240]  scientist, but I can see what they're building is not a good system for them.
[03:07:10.240 --> 03:07:18.400]  They're so horribly traumatized and so deeply entrenched in the satanic mindset that they want
[03:07:18.400 --> 03:07:24.960]  to rule a completely degenerate prison. Stop there. Stop there. I'm going to stop there.
[03:07:24.960 --> 03:07:29.280]  What you said is too important. Exactly. From start over, from what I've studied,
[03:07:29.280 --> 03:07:34.720]  the globalist are generation of a generation of tortured and molested children. And so these
[03:07:34.720 --> 03:07:41.120]  evil groups have passed it down to where the very controllers are the most enslaved out there. The
[03:07:41.120 --> 03:07:45.920]  question is, how do we stop that now? And the question is, how did it begin? Go ahead.
[03:07:46.960 --> 03:07:55.200]  So I would say it began really through very, very, very ancient manipulation of humanity.
[03:07:55.200 --> 03:08:02.160]  And again, this is deep dive research where you have to start trying to explore and look
[03:08:02.160 --> 03:08:08.320]  into the actual origins of humanity. And that could be a very, very dark place to go,
[03:08:08.320 --> 03:08:14.320]  but there's been interference with our species. Of course, the universe is teeming with life,
[03:08:14.320 --> 03:08:21.680]  not all of it balanced, not all of it spiritually advanced. And I feel that some species do get
[03:08:21.680 --> 03:08:28.800]  involved in the destiny and courses of other species. I call this interference theory. Other
[03:08:28.800 --> 03:08:35.440]  people have named it other things like, you know, you know, I can't even recall like ancient
[03:08:35.440 --> 03:08:44.320]  aliens theory, etc. Trans pharmacy or whatever. Yeah. You know, where certain species will influence
[03:08:44.320 --> 03:08:50.880]  others. This is an influence. This is interference. We have been directly interfered with. And I
[03:08:50.880 --> 03:08:55.200]  talk about it in some of my work, one of my presentations where I explore this is called
[03:08:55.200 --> 03:09:01.120]  cosmic abandonment. People want to check that out. You know, I give my takes there. But yeah,
[03:09:01.120 --> 03:09:07.520]  I am a proponent that we have been in the very ancient past and leading all the way through to
[03:09:07.520 --> 03:09:12.960]  the modern day we've been interfered with as a species. It is not just human beings that are
[03:09:12.960 --> 03:09:21.040]  ultimately involved in this entire scenario. You know, so I think, though, no matter what was
[03:09:21.040 --> 03:09:26.960]  doing the negative influence and interference, the goal ultimately remains the same. It's all
[03:09:26.960 --> 03:09:35.440]  ultimately the same. If we live a moral existence, and we do not fall prey to doing immoral things,
[03:09:35.440 --> 03:09:42.240]  no matter what is promised to us. In other words, even if comfort, money, influence, power, etc.
[03:09:42.240 --> 03:09:51.200]  we have to be spiritually strong enough to resist all of the things that evil will put before us.
[03:09:51.200 --> 03:09:57.760]  This is like the idea of, you know, in the New Testament allegory, when Jesus has shown the
[03:09:57.760 --> 03:10:04.560]  entire world by Satan, the devil, and he said, all this will be yours. You just have to, you know,
[03:10:04.560 --> 03:10:09.840]  not do what, you know, God is asking you to do and fall down and worship me in the world. That's
[03:10:09.840 --> 03:10:15.520]  it. And see, this is the seduction of evil. It's an allegory about the seduction of evil.
[03:10:15.520 --> 03:10:20.720]  And the seduction of evil is I'll give you worldly power. I'll give you worldly comfort.
[03:10:20.720 --> 03:10:25.840]  You'll have what you want as far as your fleshly concerns, your bodily concerns.
[03:10:25.840 --> 03:10:32.320]  You won't have to want for anything like that. However, that will come at the cost of the soul,
[03:10:32.320 --> 03:10:39.120]  and it will ultimately continue to degrade conditions. So what will ultimately be given
[03:10:39.120 --> 03:10:44.080]  long term is a world of absolute disaster and chaos and death.
[03:10:44.080 --> 03:10:50.320]  By the way, guys, they had an article about it in like Salon or some article last week
[03:10:50.320 --> 03:10:53.920]  from like me five years ago talking about it, but go back to Jesus with the devil
[03:10:53.920 --> 03:10:58.240]  on the mountain because this is a true story. I got a visit by a guy that had been a high level
[03:10:58.240 --> 03:11:02.640]  CIA section chief, and he knew I was on vacation somewhere, found out, came and met with me,
[03:11:02.640 --> 03:11:06.800]  and he said, hey, let me go with you and your family. So we go up, we were already there in
[03:11:06.800 --> 03:11:12.240]  this town. We go up the top of the mountain on those gondolas. It wasn't snowing. It was in the
[03:11:12.240 --> 03:11:19.440]  summer. And my wife and ex-wife and kids are all playing. And this guy, he literally gets on his
[03:11:19.440 --> 03:11:26.160]  knees. This is about 10 years ago. And he goes, listen, I know Obama and he does know Obama.
[03:11:26.160 --> 03:11:30.800]  He's written profiles on him. He goes, well, Obama loves you, wants to work with you.
[03:11:30.800 --> 03:11:34.960]  Please, you can change the world with us. You can do whatever you want. We love you. You're
[03:11:34.960 --> 03:11:40.480]  amazing. Just join us and you can have it all. And the guy was literally on a mountaintop,
[03:11:40.480 --> 03:11:44.880]  on his knees doing this. I'm not going to play myself to Christ. I'm saying it's the art type
[03:11:44.880 --> 03:11:51.360]  that that literally happened to me. Amazing. Amazing. And you know, that's what they're,
[03:11:51.360 --> 03:11:54.720]  they're promising. Well, they know what they're doing though. They're following the art type.
[03:11:55.440 --> 03:11:59.760]  Sure. Oh, absolutely. This is like a, it's like a doomsday cult. They're, they're,
[03:11:59.760 --> 03:12:03.520]  they're trying to bring about a self-fulfilled prophecy. You know, that's ultimately what
[03:12:03.520 --> 03:12:07.920]  these people are doing. They're, they're almost running, running it via a script. You know,
[03:12:08.880 --> 03:12:14.160]  people could look at it the other way that this is like some sort of actual future prediction
[03:12:14.160 --> 03:12:18.480]  by the writers of the, of the scriptures in the past. And yeah, what do you think? How do you
[03:12:18.480 --> 03:12:23.280]  think in Daniel, because it's not just like, it's not like Nostradamus where it's vague. Oh,
[03:12:23.280 --> 03:12:28.640]  the red tower will burn and the king will be killed. And then there's a fire in the town and the
[03:12:28.640 --> 03:12:33.040]  king's jealousy gets killed. Well, that's an easy prediction. But specifically, world government
[03:12:33.040 --> 03:12:38.480]  marked to buy and sell, you know, all this stuff. And then they're following it is what's crazy.
[03:12:39.120 --> 03:12:44.960]  Yeah. I think it's a combination of a form of prophecy and future prediction divination,
[03:12:44.960 --> 03:12:53.040]  if you will, combined with this cult that is, it's, it's a cult of a chileasm, which is end
[03:12:53.040 --> 03:12:58.480]  of the world related. And they're, they're saying humans are going to end the world. We're over in
[03:12:58.480 --> 03:13:05.600]  2030 AOC Meadow to get us to give up, right? That's what the point is. It's, it's basically
[03:13:05.600 --> 03:13:09.680]  following this type of end of the world script that, oh, the world's gonna end soon. You got to
[03:13:09.680 --> 03:13:14.240]  give all of your power over to us. You know, that's one way of doing it. The other way is
[03:13:14.240 --> 03:13:21.040]  destabilization, creating all the conditions, you know, wars, rumors of war, etc. And, you know,
[03:13:21.040 --> 03:13:26.560]  ultimately, it's about them creating as much chaos as possible. That's going to put people in
[03:13:26.560 --> 03:13:31.840]  further trauma. That's going to put people in fear. Fear is how they rule people. The more
[03:13:31.840 --> 03:13:37.040]  deteriorating conditions that they can create, the faster things are going to degrade because
[03:13:37.040 --> 03:13:41.200]  people are going to be fearful, and they're not going to be thinking clearly, and they're going
[03:13:41.200 --> 03:13:48.960]  to be making poor and poorly informed decisions. That's why it's so important to work psychologically.
[03:13:48.960 --> 03:13:57.120]  Do what I call shadow work to work psychologically within your own mindset, within your own psyche
[03:13:57.120 --> 03:14:04.960]  to try to heal traumas and not give in to fear. See, when you heal past traumas,
[03:14:04.960 --> 03:14:09.760]  you recognize them for what they are, and then you see patterns of trauma. This is known as
[03:14:09.760 --> 03:14:15.120]  shadow work, okay? It's a very, very important part of spiritual development. And it's how
[03:14:15.120 --> 03:14:21.680]  one is able to work through fears that they have to continue to do the right thing in spite of
[03:14:21.680 --> 03:14:29.920]  even fear of being present. Again, I don't define courage as the absence of fear, right?
[03:14:29.920 --> 03:14:35.680]  Fear can always be present. It's just we don't give in to it. Courage is not giving in to fear.
[03:14:35.680 --> 03:14:42.320]  It's doing what is right in spite of any fears that happen to be present. That's the key,
[03:14:42.320 --> 03:14:47.600]  is that we not only have to choose what is right mentally, we not only have to know what's right
[03:14:47.600 --> 03:14:54.560]  mentally, we have to choose to enact it and dispel as much fear as possible so that we do
[03:14:54.560 --> 03:15:00.560]  the right thing even if there's negative result in the immediate sense because of how bad and how
[03:15:00.560 --> 03:15:05.760]  screwed up the world is right now. We have to choose the right thing because it is the right
[03:15:05.760 --> 03:15:11.840]  thing to do, and we know that long term when we choose the right thing, it will eventually aggregate
[03:15:11.840 --> 03:15:17.440]  into positive consequence. It's that way by law. It cannot be any other way. That's right. That is
[03:15:17.440 --> 03:15:22.000]  the way that the universe is set up. That is the way the creator of the universe set up those laws
[03:15:22.000 --> 03:15:27.360]  of nature, those laws of morality. What on earth is happening dot com? He's already done an hour
[03:15:27.360 --> 03:15:30.880]  and 15 minutes with us. We're going to end this broadcast. Here in just a few minutes, I've got
[03:15:30.880 --> 03:15:35.760]  a few final things to hit, but let me bring myself into this, which I don't do to like bring myself
[03:15:35.760 --> 03:15:40.320]  up here. It's almost embarrassing to say, but I respect you, Mark. When I get attacked, I realize
[03:15:40.320 --> 03:15:45.120]  it's because I'm over the target. I'm able to deal with it. So is the crew. So is my family.
[03:15:45.120 --> 03:15:49.920]  Though it's been hard and it's been a culling here for a purification with the very best people,
[03:15:49.920 --> 03:15:54.080]  they're able to understand what's happening. But I don't think of myself as that articulate. I would
[03:15:54.080 --> 03:15:58.800]  think you're more articulate. I would think David Eich's more articulate. I would think a, a, uh,
[03:15:58.800 --> 03:16:03.040]  Tucker Carlson's more articulate, but there's no doubt because I've been around the globalist.
[03:16:03.040 --> 03:16:07.040]  They've tried to buy me off many times. I've been around them in court and in Washington. They
[03:16:07.040 --> 03:16:11.760]  literally shake with hatred and fear. I don't think it's me. I, I think it's somehow the mission
[03:16:11.760 --> 03:16:16.240]  I'm on or something in the timeline I'm doing or something I'm going to do in the future. Maybe
[03:16:16.240 --> 03:16:20.960]  it was how I was successful and was able to reach all these people. I don't see it as myself. I see
[03:16:20.960 --> 03:16:26.720]  it as somehow I was like an ingredient, the chain reaction cause. But why do you think, or maybe
[03:16:26.720 --> 03:16:31.920]  you don't think this, that the globalist absolutely hate me so much? I mean, because they are
[03:16:31.920 --> 03:16:37.040]  absurd. What do you think it is that info wars, the guest, the crew? Cause this isn't just me. It's
[03:16:37.040 --> 03:16:42.720]  this whole thing. Is it independent? It's the idea that we're not scared. That it's not scripted.
[03:16:42.720 --> 03:16:46.000]  Well, what is it that horrifies them so much about what we're doing?
[03:16:46.800 --> 03:16:53.200]  It's all of those things. And most of all, it's because that you are an influencer of other people
[03:16:53.200 --> 03:16:58.640]  that could potentially harm their agendas. And they don't want that. They want their agendas to
[03:16:58.640 --> 03:17:05.120]  reign unchallenged in the minds of the human masses. We are influencers who are slowly, but
[03:17:05.120 --> 03:17:11.840]  surely taking people out of that mind control out of their thrall, their spell that they have put
[03:17:11.840 --> 03:17:17.280]  them under. They don't believe they, they don't want to believe that that can happen. And when
[03:17:17.280 --> 03:17:22.560]  they see it, that's it. It's the broadcast they see as the tip of the spear lifting the spell,
[03:17:22.560 --> 03:17:26.320]  breaking the trance. That's it. They just see this is an art type of what they fear.
[03:17:26.320 --> 03:17:32.000]  That's right. And they don't want it influencing other people and showing them,
[03:17:32.000 --> 03:17:38.080]  this is how powerful, powerfully you can do this. You can be a powerful influencer for others for
[03:17:38.080 --> 03:17:43.760]  good and for rights and for natural law as well. And they don't want that spreading. They want to
[03:17:43.760 --> 03:17:50.080]  try to stifle that in its early embryonic stages. That's why they hate influencers at this current
[03:17:50.080 --> 03:17:54.800]  stage so much and want to shut their work down through big tech censorship. That's the ultimate
[03:17:54.800 --> 03:18:01.760]  reason. And then the main reason is they understand that we are already free spiritually and mentally
[03:18:01.760 --> 03:18:07.120]  and they're not. They're constrained. They're completely owned by fear. They're owned by evil.
[03:18:07.120 --> 03:18:10.080]  They're owned by that. That's exactly what Mike Sernovich said because he knows a lot of these
[03:18:10.080 --> 03:18:14.560]  people too. He said they're envious of us and our freedom because they've got to follow orders. We
[03:18:14.560 --> 03:18:20.480]  don't. That's right. That's right. So ultimately it's that type of jealousy and it's the hatred for
[03:18:20.480 --> 03:18:26.720]  the power of the platform. Because they're in a cult and we're not. We're in the alignment with
[03:18:26.720 --> 03:18:31.840]  the universe that God created that is real and the system. They are rebels against that and they're
[03:18:31.840 --> 03:18:37.600]  pissed that they know that we didn't fall like they did. That's right. That's right. And ultimately
[03:18:37.600 --> 03:18:42.240]  that's what enslaves them at the highest level of their being. That's what's enslaving them.
[03:18:42.240 --> 03:18:49.200]  Why don't they get out of it? The desire to control. Again, they're so degraded spiritually,
[03:18:49.200 --> 03:18:55.360]  right? And the spiritual degradation then comes across as it's a physical degradation. As you
[03:18:55.360 --> 03:19:00.880]  said, these people look like they're husks, but they don't get out of it because they've decided
[03:19:00.880 --> 03:19:06.880]  to commit to evil. They've decided to commit toward one side of the human equation. They don't
[03:19:06.880 --> 03:19:14.000]  want to be an influence for good. They look at it like, well, we're committed. We've already gone
[03:19:14.000 --> 03:19:18.960]  down this path so far. We're going to continue down this path because it's gotten us worldly power.
[03:19:18.960 --> 03:19:23.920]  It's gotten us the influence that we have over the throngs of the human masses that are under
[03:19:23.920 --> 03:19:30.400]  mind control. And they figure like, this is easier. This is an easier path to go down. Doing what's
[03:19:30.400 --> 03:19:35.120]  right is often the harder path to go down. Not going to lie to anybody, right? I don't try to
[03:19:35.120 --> 03:19:41.360]  blow smoke up people's rear end. I try to be a pragmatic realist and explain to them, if you're
[03:19:41.360 --> 03:19:47.440]  going to commit to this, yes, it's going to be difficult. It's not going to be easy. It may be
[03:19:47.440 --> 03:19:52.960]  simple in what you need to truly understand. That's common sense knowledge, right? That the truth is
[03:19:52.960 --> 03:19:58.640]  not overwhelmingly complex. It's elegantly simple as a matter of fact. That's how the creator of
[03:19:58.640 --> 03:20:05.840]  the universe designed everything. However, what is going to be difficult is because so many other
[03:20:05.840 --> 03:20:10.320]  people are in a mind control trance in a state of thrall. They're going to come after you. They
[03:20:10.320 --> 03:20:14.320]  are going to make your life miserable. But what I found going through so much is,
[03:20:14.320 --> 03:20:19.680]  if you go to the first waves of the attack, there's always blessings and cool things that happen
[03:20:19.680 --> 03:20:23.600]  after. And so Thomas Jefferson called the animating concepts of liberty. So people ask,
[03:20:23.600 --> 03:20:26.960]  how are you handling all these attacks of the immunization? I've never been more happy. I'm
[03:20:26.960 --> 03:20:30.800]  mad at myself that I eat too much and don't take care of myself. And I'm mad at myself for like,
[03:20:30.800 --> 03:20:35.120]  you know, little physical sins. But at the end of the day, I've been pure to what the mission
[03:20:35.120 --> 03:20:40.480]  is and I'm more alive than ever. And that enrages the enemy that they're so controlled, but I get
[03:20:40.480 --> 03:20:45.680]  to be free. Mark Pascio, incredible in-depth interview. Thanks for coming on with us. What
[03:20:45.680 --> 03:20:50.640]  on earth is happening dot com? You can find your materials, your great t-shirts, your writings there
[03:20:50.640 --> 03:20:55.120]  and mention four or five of the most important talks you've given. There's so many there that
[03:20:55.120 --> 03:21:04.560]  people should watch. Thank you, Alex. Yes, my seminar called natural law seminar is my absolute
[03:21:04.560 --> 03:21:10.080]  magnum opus. That is my seminal work on natural law. That is an absolute must watch for anybody
[03:21:10.080 --> 03:21:15.200]  that wants to explore these topics more. I would tell people to look at my documentary called
[03:21:16.160 --> 03:21:21.200]  the science of natural law, about an hour and eight minute documentary that gives the very
[03:21:21.200 --> 03:21:27.920]  basics of the principles and does it in a very visual format. I would say check out my presentation
[03:21:27.920 --> 03:21:34.720]  called street wise spirituality. Very important information about what it means to be truly awake.
[03:21:34.720 --> 03:21:39.280]  I would tell people to look at my whole demystifying the occult series. And finally,
[03:21:39.280 --> 03:21:46.640]  I would ask them to watch my presentation on order followers, which I call the cult of ultimate evil.
[03:21:46.640 --> 03:21:54.800]  That's a very important presentation to understand why order following is not a virtue and obedience
[03:21:54.800 --> 03:21:59.360]  is not a virtue. I get into what the military and the police do in that one. It's a very,
[03:21:59.360 --> 03:22:04.240]  very powerful presentation. It's a very controversial one, but it's one that will wake a lot of people
[03:22:04.240 --> 03:22:08.560]  up. Those are the seminal works that I would have people check out in my material. And of course,
[03:22:08.560 --> 03:22:15.040]  my podcast series. All right, what on earth is happening.com Mark Passio. Have a great weekend.
[03:22:15.040 --> 03:22:20.480]  Thank you so much for the time. Alex. Thank you so much. All right, folks. I'm going to go to break.
[03:22:20.480 --> 03:22:24.480]  Come back with some closing comments. I want to thank the crew for being here for what is a three
[03:22:24.480 --> 03:22:29.360]  plus hour, four hour broadcast today. And Lord willing, I'll be back tomorrow night, four to six
[03:22:29.360 --> 03:22:34.480]  p.m. at 0 and six to 8 p.m. was Sunday live. But Mark Passio knows what he's talking about.
[03:22:34.480 --> 03:22:41.520]  He's a very smart man. And imagine the enemy knows this and they've decided to go against
[03:22:41.520 --> 03:22:46.640]  this. Like I'm trying to go with God. I'm trying to go with natural law. I'm trying to be good.
[03:22:46.640 --> 03:22:51.280]  And every time I do, it's great. Any little things I do wrong or horrible. And it's just like,
[03:22:51.280 --> 03:22:57.760]  imagine trying to screw things up. Imagine trying to hurt people and getting off on that.
[03:22:58.560 --> 03:23:03.280]  It's, it's, it's absolutely sick. But we're going to run this and air this until four p.m.
[03:23:03.280 --> 03:23:09.120]  tomorrow. So again, please share it because the propaganda would not be necessary. The situation
[03:23:09.120 --> 03:23:24.960]  was helpful. Let's stay with us. It was a rough day for the despicable and ridiculous Alex Jones
[03:23:24.960 --> 03:23:31.440]  today. Alex Jones was ordered by jury in Connecticut to pay $965 million in damages
[03:23:31.440 --> 03:23:34.480]  to the families of eight victims of the Sandy Hook massacre.
[03:23:38.160 --> 03:23:45.360]  Alex Jones has been ordered to pay Sandy Hook victims families nearly $1 billion dollars.
[03:23:51.040 --> 03:23:57.200]  Conspiracy theorist Alex Jones was ordered to pay almost a billion dollars in damages.
[03:23:57.200 --> 03:24:03.200]  A billion dollar verdict. You heard that right. Billion with the capital. Bye.
[03:24:05.520 --> 03:24:14.880]  $965 million. A billion dollars. $100 billion dollars. I am extremely honored
[03:24:16.000 --> 03:24:21.600]  to be seen by the globalists as their number one enemy. I am blessed to know that our information
