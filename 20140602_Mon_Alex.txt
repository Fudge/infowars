[00:00.000 --> 00:12.200]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[00:12.200 --> 00:38.200]  he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin, Texas Alex Jones
[00:38.200 --> 00:46.600]  Ladies and gentlemen it is Monday June 2nd 2014 I am your host Alex Jones and
[00:46.600 --> 00:52.080]  we're going to be live here for the next three hours I am coming to you from
[00:52.080 --> 00:57.920]  the road with my family we are going to have Staff Sergeant Joe Biggs and
[00:57.920 --> 01:04.840]  FallWars.com reporter joining us during the next 45 minutes or so with one of
[01:04.840 --> 01:10.000]  our other reporters Leigh-Anne McAdoo of Info Wars Nightly News we've got a lot
[01:10.000 --> 01:16.080]  of geopolitical news a lot of Obama scandal news more resignation news
[01:16.080 --> 01:21.360]  reportedly coming a lot of other situations boiling around the world
[01:21.360 --> 01:28.080]  but this Beau Bergdahl army story last week we see it come out that Obama has
[01:28.080 --> 01:33.120]  intentionally blown the cover of a CIA asset and we'll be breaking down all
[01:33.120 --> 01:36.200]  the names and details with Staff Sergeant Joe Biggs coming of the next
[01:36.200 --> 01:41.080]  segment we see the report that he blows the cover of the CIA asset and is in
[01:41.080 --> 01:48.680]  hot water for that and before we find out why this is all going on Beau Bergdahl
[01:48.680 --> 01:53.880]  who who told members of his army team I'm gonna go AWOL which is clearly a
[01:53.880 --> 02:02.120]  cover could be a cover for him to then artificially defect to the Taliban to
[02:02.120 --> 02:06.800]  quote then infiltrate that group and we know both groups Taliban Al Qaeda there's
[02:06.800 --> 02:10.120]  two or three different groups of Taliban different sub factions of Al Qaeda
[02:10.120 --> 02:14.800]  different sub factions of the CIA different sub factions in the army this
[02:14.800 --> 02:19.880]  is what countries and intelligence agencies do the whole thing stinks really
[02:19.880 --> 02:24.200]  bad then you've got a Twitter that appears to be his dad's operating for
[02:24.200 --> 02:30.640]  years that came out and we'll put that tweet on screen we have a Twitter account
[02:30.640 --> 02:35.800]  where his father is talking about there'll be great vengeance there'll be
[02:35.800 --> 02:40.560]  great payback for every Afghan child that's been every Afghan child that's
[02:40.560 --> 02:45.040]  been killed and then his dad gets up on television to start speaking in Farsi
[02:45.040 --> 02:49.440]  immediately when they started breaking Friday through Saturday Staff Sergeant
[02:49.440 --> 02:53.880]  Joe Biggs was calling myself and others saying look this just doesn't hold water
[02:53.880 --> 02:58.760]  I'd heard about this guy you know he said years ago from people that were in
[02:58.760 --> 03:02.800]  his unit saying that something was you know going on with him and for those
[03:02.800 --> 03:06.280]  that don't know what sheet dipping is you will stage your death or you'll get
[03:06.280 --> 03:09.840]  out of the military or they'll claim you failed at special forces training like
[03:09.840 --> 03:15.000]  Ed Snowden or Timothy McVeigh and then you're put into clandestine operations
[03:15.000 --> 03:19.400]  which is confirmed now with McVeigh and Snowden that's not speculation so when
[03:19.400 --> 03:23.880]  you see this MO we ought to get Steve Pachinic to pop in for ten minutes today
[03:23.880 --> 03:29.640]  or tomorrow on this I was just thinking he's saying that the Snowden situation
[03:29.640 --> 03:32.760]  is a double agent operation and then now Snowden comes out and says I was
[03:32.760 --> 03:40.480]  trained as a spy of the CIA and by others so we have that report as well so
[03:40.480 --> 03:46.880]  again it becomes a larger diversion and a distraction and just a PR stunt by
[03:46.880 --> 03:51.800]  Obama to say look I'm bringing our boys home by releasing a whole bunch of top
[03:51.800 --> 04:01.320]  Taliban people out of Gitmo so I'm not saying that it is a conspiracy yet but
[04:01.320 --> 04:04.880]  it's definitely pointing in that direction and we should never forget
[04:04.880 --> 04:12.760]  that this is the same administration that hands down hands down stage the
[04:12.760 --> 04:18.840]  release of the death of bin Laden this is the administration that lied and said
[04:18.840 --> 04:21.320]  the Navy witness to being thrown overboard turns out that's not true and
[04:21.320 --> 04:24.680]  fake the situation from photos said they were watching live video fees that
[04:24.680 --> 04:28.360]  didn't happen I've interviewed the Navy Seals families on air they even know
[04:28.360 --> 04:38.080]  the name of the bin Laden lookalike double agent and and I don't have to go
[04:38.080 --> 04:41.120]  back into that whole story of why that was fake meant to cover up the whole
[04:41.120 --> 04:45.400]  birth certificate story but this this has all the earmarks of a stunt we're
[04:45.400 --> 04:49.560]  gonna dissect it coming up in the aftermath of Bilderberg 2014 it was
[04:49.560 --> 04:55.000]  really important and just a ton of other vital news today stay with us we have
[04:55.000 --> 05:00.200]  some huge guests coming up this week as well it's a big week stay with us a
[05:00.200 --> 05:04.240]  chemical spill contaminating the water supply in nine West Virginia counties
[05:04.240 --> 05:07.720]  this year alone over 300,000 people in West Virginia had their drinking water
[05:07.720 --> 05:11.680]  contaminate what are the health effects of having these drugs in our drinking
[05:11.680 --> 05:15.400]  water it's forced medical treatment without the consent of residents my
[05:15.400 --> 05:18.840]  friends water filtration is one of the most basic actions you can take to
[05:18.840 --> 05:22.200]  protect you and your family from the harmful toxins and heavy metals in your
[05:22.200 --> 05:26.200]  tap water on average the county said it sprays with the glyphosate at least once
[05:26.200 --> 05:30.200]  a week few filters cut out the glyphosates that is found in water supplies
[05:30.200 --> 05:35.320]  worldwide removed pesticides herbicides chloramines hydrofluorosalic acid
[05:35.320 --> 05:39.880]  sodium hexafluorosilicate chloride it is in teeth and coffee it's in water to
[05:39.880 --> 05:43.680]  breads and toothpaste it is our responsibility to protect our families
[05:43.680 --> 05:47.360]  the establishment's not gonna do it it's time to take action it's time to

[05:59.720 --> 06:04.840]  from the water table to our soils to the atmosphere itself our world is
[06:04.840 --> 06:08.400]  becoming more and more toxic each and every day but it's not just the air
[06:08.400 --> 06:12.400]  outside that's toxic indoor air has been shown to have two to five times higher
[06:12.400 --> 06:16.640]  concentrations of pollutants than even outdoor air and most Americans spend 90
[06:16.640 --> 06:20.480]  percent of their time inside using toxic chemicals within their homes there are
[06:20.480 --> 06:24.640]  more than 42 million smokers in the United States well over a thousand
[06:24.640 --> 06:28.400]  types of mold in mildew linked to numerous conditions and don't forget the
[06:28.400 --> 06:31.800]  fact that six million Americans live with pets they're allergic to as well
[06:31.800 --> 06:35.480]  when I began to research these statistics it was clear to me it was time to
[06:35.480 --> 06:39.880]  start cleansing my lungs in order to combat the toxic environment that we
[06:39.880 --> 06:43.760]  cannot escape but we can fight back against made with organic and wild

[08:09.720 --> 08:22.200]  waging war on corruption it's Alex Jones
[08:22.200 --> 08:30.400]  so much what we see on the news concerning the CIA the FBI the NSF 8
[08:30.400 --> 08:35.120]  MI6 different intelligence agencies doesn't even have to do with the public
[08:35.120 --> 08:41.520]  it is different agencies that are basically fighting with each other so
[08:41.520 --> 08:47.960]  many times it turns out that that's really what's going on and earlier last
[08:47.960 --> 08:52.880]  week we had the Washington Times break the story that was then picked up by the
[08:52.880 --> 09:00.760]  other media Obama insists on protecting in cell sources days after blowing CIA
[09:00.760 --> 09:07.560]  agents cover the head agent in Kabul in Afghanistan three days after the White
[09:07.560 --> 09:12.480]  House inadvertently blew the cover yeah right of the CIA's top officer in Kabul
[09:12.480 --> 09:16.120]  President Obama on Wednesday said his administration is committed to effective
[09:16.120 --> 09:21.920]  intelligence gathering and protecting sources and methods abroad and again not
[09:21.920 --> 09:25.480]  that this story in and of itself is that important unless you use it to learn how
[09:25.480 --> 09:29.720]  things really work and a first approximation of this looking at it this
[09:29.720 --> 09:36.240]  weekend the Beau Bergdahl army story who's been in captivity for almost five
[09:36.240 --> 09:40.680]  years supposedly looks like an infiltration operation where you
[09:40.680 --> 09:47.320]  purposely claim you've defected to the Taliban and then they don't trust you
[09:47.320 --> 09:51.240]  they grab you and then your quasi prisoner and then you act like you've
[09:51.240 --> 09:56.320]  got Stockholm syndrome and that you basically join them and then you have
[09:56.320 --> 10:00.160]  the dad with his Twitter reportedly it looks like it's his real Twitter it's
[10:00.160 --> 10:03.920]  not verified but it's been operating for years saying you know you know people
[10:03.920 --> 10:08.800]  will pay for the death of Afghan children and growing a big beard and all the
[10:08.800 --> 10:12.560]  rest of it the whole thing stinks to high heaven the fact that Obama has him
[10:12.560 --> 10:17.080]  and his wife out there they wouldn't trot some soldiers dad mom out unless they
[10:17.080 --> 10:20.720]  absolutely knew they were entrusted them this is the same Obama ran the whole
[10:20.720 --> 10:25.040]  fake bin Laden death deal that's been proven to be a fraud hands down up one
[10:25.040 --> 10:28.000]  side and down the other we should probably on the nightly news tonight and
[10:28.000 --> 10:33.120]  I'll air it tomorrow recap the lies of the bin Laden raid with the fact that
[10:33.120 --> 10:36.200]  they court-martialed a record number of people on the aircraft carrier they said
[10:36.200 --> 10:39.360]  they never saw it the Navy SEALs that have families who've been on the show
[10:39.360 --> 10:44.200]  two different families saying no we know the name of the bin Laden double
[10:44.200 --> 10:49.880]  lookalike who was killed at the compound a CIA asset they set up turned out the
[10:49.880 --> 10:54.200]  CIA was running in that whole area of the fake inoculation program that was
[10:54.200 --> 10:58.720]  their cover again ladies and gentlemen this is ridiculous you send Navy SEALs
[10:58.720 --> 11:05.040]  in to literally kill your own double asset bin Laden lookalike and then you
[11:05.040 --> 11:08.000]  blow up their helicopter on the ground trying to get rid of them the
[11:08.000 --> 11:11.720]  experimental helicopter then you bury the fake body on the ship but there is
[11:11.720 --> 11:15.800]  no body no one sees it you put fake photos out claiming they're Pentagon
[11:15.800 --> 11:22.600]  leaked fake situation room photos fake video feeds that weren't real dr. Steve
[11:22.600 --> 11:26.480]  Pachennick who is about the most high-level spy we've ever had on I mean
[11:26.480 --> 11:34.000]  he covered the books with Tom Clancy he obviously ran the Camp David Accords
[11:34.000 --> 11:41.080]  helped found Delta Force with General Boykin it has run all sorts of clandestine
[11:41.080 --> 11:45.160]  operations snuck into North Korea last year for us because he knows the North
[11:45.160 --> 11:49.840]  Koreans basically got in and then admitted he was there you know he said
[11:49.840 --> 11:56.160]  that was totally staged on my show in 2002 before it came out on CBS news that
[11:56.160 --> 12:00.600]  bin Laden had been treated at a US military hospital in Dubai he said
[12:00.600 --> 12:05.040]  that before it was in the news and after he broke that on our show also a
[12:05.040 --> 12:07.440]  member of the Council on Foreign Relations high level at the time till he
[12:07.440 --> 12:16.480]  resigned he then came out and you know basically predicted even more and he
[12:16.480 --> 12:21.120]  said this was staged then that his body was on ice that they would stage his
[12:21.120 --> 12:24.800]  death later maybe even in a new administration and then it all came
[12:24.800 --> 12:30.760]  true like he said so that said until about 45 after were joined by Staff
[12:30.760 --> 12:34.480]  Sergeant Joe Biggs a combat veteran of course been written about an Esquire
[12:34.480 --> 12:38.400]  magazine for some of the big battles he was in that were covered by the late
[12:38.400 --> 12:45.680]  Michael Hastings who I believe was probably a agency asset we don't know
[12:45.680 --> 12:50.160]  which agency but he had the whole cutout of that inside interagency battles
[12:50.160 --> 12:53.960]  probably killed with a car bomb to cover that up told friends and family he was
[12:53.960 --> 12:59.160]  running for his life minutes before he his car blew up and the FBI was
[12:59.160 --> 13:03.520]  investigating him said they weren't so again Michael Hastings friend combat
[13:03.520 --> 13:08.120]  veteran of Afghanistan and Iraq just immediately said things didn't fit
[13:08.120 --> 13:13.280]  Friday and Saturday and I said hold hold off stand down I don't want to be the
[13:13.280 --> 13:17.520]  first out front on this I believe you it is coming on the heels of this head
[13:17.520 --> 13:21.600]  CIA asset having their cover blown that probably meant that this other guy's got
[13:21.600 --> 13:26.880]  cover blown and so they said okay we've got to now stage you coming back and I've
[13:26.880 --> 13:31.240]  seen this before where they will have a quote Al Qaeda operative and their cover
[13:31.240 --> 13:35.240]  gets blown is really CIA or defense intelligence and then they'll quietly
[13:35.240 --> 13:39.200]  release them and change their name so this has been done over and over again
[13:39.200 --> 13:45.320]  now I'm not saying Bo Bergdahl is a CIA asset or is a defense intelligence asset
[13:45.320 --> 13:51.480]  and this is all staged I'm saying all the pieces and the timing of this points
[13:51.480 --> 13:56.440]  at that now sometimes things point at something and that's not what it is but
[13:56.440 --> 14:02.000]  bunch of red flashing arrows you know like it's a late-night diner are pointing
[14:02.000 --> 14:06.600]  into this thing and we're just analyzing it we don't claim we have all the
[14:06.600 --> 14:10.680]  answers but we have a great pool of experts from you know staff sergeants
[14:10.680 --> 14:15.400]  who knew some of the people talked to folks involved in the unit he said that
[14:15.400 --> 14:19.520]  to me Saturday and I said well I haven't seen that yet then Sunday it was in
[14:19.520 --> 14:23.440]  CNN and we'll put that article on screen that his people in his unit are saying
[14:23.440 --> 14:28.920]  something was weird look staged us walked off into the desert this is pretty
[14:28.920 --> 14:34.440]  crazy and again that would be the cover for him actually defecting or or going
[14:34.440 --> 14:38.840]  AWOL and then getting getting captured so we'll get staff sergeant Joe Biggs on
[14:38.840 --> 14:44.040]  this Leanne McAdoo's been following this since she was following the CIA asset
[14:44.040 --> 14:48.880]  section leader in that area having this cover blown and again when they claim
[14:48.880 --> 14:52.680]  this is done by accident give me a break when Bush did this it was a huge deal
[14:52.680 --> 14:56.880]  and should be why is it now happening because there's interagency fighting
[14:56.880 --> 15:02.440]  going on bare minimum and it's not a good trade either for Taliban commanders
[15:02.440 --> 15:08.360]  or is it five for some army soldier they wouldn't normally do this why are they
[15:08.360 --> 15:12.880]  doing it now this will encourage the grabbing of more soldiers and again he
[15:12.880 --> 15:17.800]  me this may not be clandestine maybe a great guy I'm not even saying that I
[15:17.800 --> 15:21.240]  believe that's happening I'm saying things point towards that we'd be
[15:21.240 --> 15:24.520]  crazy if we didn't bring it up staff sergeant Joe Biggs what's your take on
[15:24.520 --> 15:29.440]  this well Saturday just like a lot of people I woke up to the news that Beau
[15:29.440 --> 15:32.840]  Bergdahl was finally coming home and I'm sitting here thinking just like most
[15:32.840 --> 15:36.280]  people that gut reaction wow this is great but as I started really going back
[15:36.280 --> 15:40.600]  and looking at a lot of the stuff that was going on I saw my buddy Jason Lea
[15:40.600 --> 15:46.160]  pulled out of LA he said that he's known about Bergdahl coming back since
[15:46.160 --> 15:51.240]  last Saturday he is on the White House email list and the first email came out
[15:51.240 --> 15:55.720]  saying Beau Bergdahl's coming back and then he said he got another email that
[15:55.720 --> 16:00.280]  you know a person you know unknown was coming back so for some reason the
[16:00.280 --> 16:05.440]  White House went from saying him to then not saying his name again so I found
[16:05.440 --> 16:10.920]  that interesting but if you want pull up that video of Beau's father talking to
[16:10.920 --> 16:18.680]  the president Saturday morning this too in all the aspects of your recovery to
[16:18.680 --> 16:29.360]  full health but most of all I'm proud of how much you wanted to help the Afghan
[16:29.360 --> 16:37.120]  people and what you were willing to do to go to that length
[16:38.120 --> 16:45.120]  father did a an interview yesterday on CNN and what he was talking about and I
[16:45.120 --> 16:51.160]  just found it chilling he the whole interview he's very calm and collective
[16:51.160 --> 16:55.040]  but as soon as he talks about what his son's doing for Afghanistan you see
[16:55.040 --> 16:58.840]  that vein pop up out of his head and you see him get real teary-eyed and choked
[16:58.840 --> 17:04.360]  up and I found that to be just very you know unusual you know a lot of the
[17:04.360 --> 17:10.680]  people were saying that his son even before deployment talked about he said
[17:10.680 --> 17:15.240]  hey if this deployment is bogus I will walk off the base and into the mountains
[17:15.240 --> 17:25.240]  of Pakistan you told me that you have that article upon info wars.com when I
[17:25.240 --> 17:29.920]  got a when I got to Bob Burgdoll's account the Twitter account I saw that
[17:29.920 --> 17:34.080]  tweet and I saw it right before I got deleted he says I'm still working to
[17:34.080 --> 17:38.680]  free all Guantanamo prisoners God will repay for the death of every Afghan
[17:38.680 --> 17:43.720]  child I'm in well Beau's father is supposed to be a devout Christian so
[17:43.720 --> 17:47.240]  the fact that he misspells I'm in I found that to be a little weird too as
[17:47.240 --> 17:55.040]  well but immediately they took that tweet down and I find that you know that's
[17:55.040 --> 17:59.560]  that in itself right there is a little shady too you know yesterday with that
[17:59.560 --> 18:04.800]  press release from his father when he goes and talks about that it just sent
[18:04.800 --> 18:10.480]  chills down my back you know now we know Obama released five Gitmo detainees for
[18:10.480 --> 18:14.320]  Beau's release you know what does that mean well the president's message to the
[18:14.320 --> 18:19.880]  Taliban and other enemies out there as America will pay any price to get someone
[18:19.880 --> 18:25.560]  out I mean these are bad things for our enemies to know that five Gitmo detainees
[18:25.560 --> 18:31.120]  are equivalent to one American now what if the Taliban kidnapped someone
[18:31.120 --> 18:35.560]  tomorrow you know if that's a civilian are we going to just forget about them
[18:35.560 --> 18:40.240]  because they're military no you know we're gonna go after them and when you
[18:40.240 --> 18:44.040]  put the price of an American you know the put the price on an American head
[18:44.040 --> 18:48.320]  like Sergeant Beau Bergdahl you put prices on everyone's head now it's
[18:48.320 --> 18:53.640]  unsafe for all Americans all over the world now to be out we have let me ask
[18:53.640 --> 18:58.600]  you this question though separately on the heels of the CIA assets cover being
[18:58.600 --> 19:04.320]  blown we now learn weeks before I mean that to me is a big connection to
[19:04.320 --> 19:09.640]  suddenly this guy's being sent back what does this sound like to you I mean
[19:09.640 --> 19:12.680]  what's your gut tell you is going on there yeah I mean when I had time to sit
[19:12.680 --> 19:15.920]  down and think about this you know they're talking about how they blew CIA
[19:15.920 --> 19:21.200]  operatives cover and all the sudden Beau Bergdahl needed to be pulled out you
[19:21.200 --> 19:24.760]  know of being captive because he was in danger but he wasn't in danger for the
[19:24.760 --> 19:29.160]  entire five years he was held captive I mean that doesn't make sense the Hakani
[19:29.160 --> 19:33.680]  Network is one of the most vile evil terrorist networks out there they're
[19:33.680 --> 19:38.080]  called the Sopranos of Afghanistan you know these guys chopped people's heads
[19:38.080 --> 19:42.400]  off and he was fine for those five years but now he's in danger I don't get
[19:42.400 --> 19:47.160]  that well let's come back and continue to break this down and what this means
[19:47.160 --> 19:50.480]  for Obama with all the different resignations in his administration and
[19:50.480 --> 19:53.440]  the rest of Australia have a staff sergeant job eggs I'm Alex Jones it's

[24:22.040 --> 24:26.000]  Ladies and gentlemen thank you for joining us with this Monday Worldwide
[24:26.000 --> 24:31.560]  June 2nd 2014 global transmission. I am Alex Jones reporting from on the road
[24:31.560 --> 24:34.960]  and I will be reporting for the next few days from the road but the great part
[24:34.960 --> 24:39.200]  about the Info Wars operation is we have the amazing team of the writers, the
[24:39.200 --> 24:44.240]  researchers, the investigative journalist, the reporters, everyone working
[24:44.240 --> 24:54.040]  together with that great team behind the scenes technically as well. Chris
[24:54.040 --> 24:58.760]  Jordan, John Bowne, Nico, everyone. I mean there's a lot of folks I just don't
[24:58.760 --> 25:03.040]  have time to thank but they are certainly all amazing in there doing a
[25:03.040 --> 25:08.400]  super job. Now going back to Staff Sergeant Joe Biggs who has friends from
[25:08.400 --> 25:13.080]  the Army who knew this guy and then they turned him into this cause celeb and
[25:13.080 --> 25:16.720]  you know what he might have gone off in the desert and got grabbed by these
[25:16.720 --> 25:22.440]  guys. We need to go back to the original story of Bo Bergdahl. What do we know
[25:22.440 --> 25:26.440]  about that? I mean how did he get supposedly captured by the Taliban and
[25:26.440 --> 25:31.960]  why are his comrades saying that he was more of a deserter? That's the
[25:31.960 --> 25:37.760]  headline and CNN than this Taliban victim. What's really going on here and
[25:37.760 --> 25:42.720]  why does his dad get all choked up when he talks about the Afghan people? I
[25:42.720 --> 25:49.200]  mean that just sounds like a siob to me. Well he was in a infantry unit out of
[25:49.200 --> 25:54.480]  Alaska and when he joined the Army a lot of the guys didn't like him because
[25:54.480 --> 25:59.520]  they said he didn't interact with people. He read books all the time,
[25:59.520 --> 26:05.360]  say to himself practice meditation. He would do curls with his saw. You know he
[26:05.360 --> 26:12.680]  was just very dedicated to his cause at the time and now we have two stories in
[26:12.680 --> 26:17.560]  the first story is is you know he had walked off the base and was then AWOL.
[26:17.560 --> 26:23.480]  Another story is is that he was on a foot patrol and fell behind and he
[26:23.480 --> 26:27.240]  actually fell behind to use the bathroom. He had you know sat down and to use the
[26:27.240 --> 26:33.360]  bathroom and a Taliban guy grabbed him and you know took him and you can if you
[26:33.360 --> 26:36.920]  read that the Hastings article it talks about he's got some of the chatter in
[26:36.920 --> 26:41.280]  there on the Taliban. They were laughing saying oh we've got an American let's
[26:41.280 --> 26:44.360]  make a video let's get it out to everyone and let them know that we have
[26:44.360 --> 26:50.040]  somebody. So there's two different stories but I find it believable that he
[26:50.040 --> 26:57.680]  did walk off the base and desert. What do you think about that? Well I mean that's
[26:57.680 --> 27:02.520]  what his buddies are saying and they could be wrong. It's just that again he
[27:02.520 --> 27:06.520]  didn't fit in with everybody and just what you described there it sounds more
[27:06.520 --> 27:11.120]  like an intelligence agency operatives MO than a soldier's MO. What do you
[27:11.120 --> 27:15.960]  think? Well the funny thing of those is about his father he is a U.S. Postal
[27:15.960 --> 27:19.960]  Service worker and had been for 20-something years. The fact that he
[27:19.960 --> 27:25.000]  speaks Pashtun in a very perfect dialect. I don't know many people in Idaho who
[27:25.000 --> 27:28.720]  probably speak Pashtun but I think it's kind of odd that this man speaks it to
[27:28.720 --> 27:33.520]  the tee. I mean just his the way he sounded the way he said everything was
[27:33.520 --> 27:37.400]  spot-on from what I heard when I was in Afghanistan. So I think there's a little
[27:37.400 --> 27:41.840]  something behind him. What was Bergdahl's special mission to help the
[27:41.840 --> 27:46.100]  Afghan people? I mean what does that mean? Well from a lot of the emails that he
[27:46.100 --> 27:50.040]  was sending home he said that you know he was ashamed to be an American
[27:50.040 --> 27:54.760]  because of what he saw going on over there and that he felt like he needed
[27:54.760 --> 27:59.640]  to help the Afghan people and get out there. So I'm thinking he and then he's
[27:59.640 --> 28:02.960]  the one that gets captured. He's the one that gets captured. Yeah sounds like a
[28:02.960 --> 28:06.520]  perfect person to infiltrate their network. I mean I mean maybe he is a
[28:06.520 --> 28:10.520]  hero like his dad says. If he had the courage to get picked up on purpose to
[28:10.520 --> 28:14.800]  go into captivity. I mean maybe the guy is a hero. We're just not getting it.
[28:14.800 --> 28:18.400]  Then the question is why is Obama now revealing it? It's because his cover
[28:18.400 --> 28:23.920]  got blown by this section chief. Well it's weird when his dad talks
[28:23.920 --> 28:29.200]  yes he goes I'm proud of how much you wanted to help Afghan people that you
[28:29.200 --> 28:34.920]  were willing to go to the link that you did to help them out. So is he confirming
[28:34.920 --> 28:40.360]  that his son did in fact walk off a base and go AWOL? That's what I find to be
[28:40.360 --> 28:43.200]  just a little everyone's stories right now when you start putting all these
[28:43.200 --> 28:46.500]  pieces together. You know look at him right now he's smiling looking at the
[28:46.500 --> 28:50.640]  president. I just think there's something other than this whole happy
[28:50.640 --> 28:54.400]  welcoming home story going on. I was about to say most families they're not
[28:54.400 --> 28:58.480]  going to get anywhere near Obama. The Navy SEAL families you name it. I mean
[28:58.480 --> 29:02.240]  they act like they know each other. I mean this this this this whole thing
[29:02.240 --> 29:05.600]  the father needs to answer these questions because he's done some stuff
[29:05.600 --> 29:09.880]  that's unusual. You do unusual stuff under stress but I mean you know I thought
[29:09.880 --> 29:12.680]  he was like a hillbilly with the beard and all that to start speaking Pashtun.
[29:12.680 --> 29:18.040]  I tell you bigs I want to find out from your other Army buddies what they think
[29:18.040 --> 29:20.560]  about this. I know you've already been talking to some of them and when we come
[29:20.560 --> 29:24.160]  back let's talk about that with Leanne McAdoo and let's also open the phones up
[29:24.160 --> 29:31.520]  for active duty or former army that know anything specifically 800-259-9231 do

[32:04.520 --> 32:08.000]  this year alone over 300,000 people in West Virginia had their drinking water
[32:08.000 --> 32:11.920]  contaminate. What are the health effects of having these drugs in our drinking

[32:22.400 --> 32:26.520]  tap water. On average the county said it sprays with glyphosate at least once a
[32:26.520 --> 32:30.400]  week. Few filters cut out the glyphosate that is found in water supplies
[32:30.400 --> 32:36.120]  worldwide. Remove pesticides, herbicides, chloramines, hydrofluorosalic acid, sodium
[32:36.120 --> 32:40.160]  hexafluorosilicate. All right it is in tea, it's in coffee, it's in water, it's in

[33:43.480 --> 33:48.160]  expose bad stuff. I've had family that worked in the Army and CIA and places
[33:48.160 --> 33:53.320]  who were great patriots and who loved Liberty but it's the it's the top-down
[33:53.320 --> 34:00.080]  system that is that is so incredibly corrupt and when you study this for 20
[34:00.080 --> 34:04.080]  years like I ever longer you learn to recognize when a story doesn't wash and
[34:04.080 --> 34:08.440]  by the way I'm not the only one. Our listeners Saturday and Sunday when we
[34:08.440 --> 34:13.240]  had just little articles posted on info wars.com with the mainstream story and
[34:13.240 --> 34:18.040]  just little blurbs from AP and CNN and places people like how dare you post
[34:18.040 --> 34:21.880]  this saying this is real this is pure bull and you know Jones I'm getting
[34:21.880 --> 34:25.560]  sick of you toe in the establishment line and by the way that shooting two
[34:25.560 --> 34:31.840]  weeks ago in California was fake listen I know they stage stuff I know a lot of
[34:31.840 --> 34:36.360]  stuff's fake sometimes things aren't fake and I just don't say something's
[34:36.360 --> 34:40.480]  fake out of the gates the bin Laden thing takes two hours to cover we've done
[34:40.480 --> 34:44.680]  it the videos have you know three four million views apiece on YouTube alone of
[34:44.680 --> 34:50.200]  my radio show and TV show breaking down why the bin Laden thing was fake this
[34:50.200 --> 34:56.120]  looks like it's fake but we don't know how it's fake is my view it we're not
[34:56.120 --> 35:00.160]  getting one-tenth the story this is propaganda for Obama it's blowing up in
[35:00.160 --> 35:05.760]  his face showing that they tried to spin something that was already bad you can
[35:05.760 --> 35:08.920]  tell when they really stage something they're all lined up they're all ready
[35:08.920 --> 35:14.880]  it's a unified message like Sandy Hook or the bin Laden or supposed raid
[35:14.880 --> 35:19.360]  killing but in the case of other events when it's all over the map and a train
[35:19.360 --> 35:24.200]  wreck it's them trying to use a crisis and not let it go to waste as the
[35:24.200 --> 35:29.520]  White House Chief of Staff Rahm Emanuel now Chicago mob boss said now before I
[35:29.520 --> 35:32.560]  go any further we're gonna go back to Biggs place in White House clips get
[35:32.560 --> 35:37.320]  Lee and McAdoo's take on this and take your calls and I'll let Biggs go off
[35:37.320 --> 35:40.720]  the screen and announce who those callers are once we're ready to go to
[35:40.720 --> 35:45.600]  those calls at about 45 after or so because again he's in the main chair
[35:45.600 --> 35:49.600]  running the show in the first hour we have another guest coming up in the
[35:49.600 --> 35:53.720]  second and third hour a John Rappaport who I'd like to have on routinely he was
[35:53.720 --> 35:57.160]  on for 15 minutes with a Sunday he'll be riding shotgun with us covering a host
[35:57.160 --> 36:00.880]  of news as well today will probably rope in some of the other reporters today and
[36:00.880 --> 36:05.760]  play some of their special reports as well but please don't forget this
[36:05.760 --> 36:10.920]  entire media operation that's truly organic truly liberty-based truth-based
[36:10.920 --> 36:15.480]  our bias is telling the truth our bias is being honorable our bias is
[36:15.480 --> 36:20.080]  chivalry our bias is trying to bring back freedom and what made America great
[36:20.080 --> 36:25.720]  our bias is being good guys our bias is not being cowards and we fund this
[36:25.720 --> 36:30.080]  operation bringing you the very best products out there the propure g2 filters
[36:30.080 --> 36:33.440]  that cut out all the glyphosate the hydrofluorosilicic acid all of it
[36:33.440 --> 36:38.000]  annihilates the competition side-by-side or I'd be selling the competition we
[36:38.000 --> 36:42.720]  sell more than 12 different companies non-gmo heirloom super high quality
[36:42.720 --> 36:46.280]  seeds at the lowest price available anywhere at the info or store seed
[36:46.280 --> 36:51.720]  center in four store.com if there were five great gravity-fed filter
[36:51.720 --> 36:55.040]  companies out there that we hadn't tried to work with over the years and had
[36:55.040 --> 37:00.320]  issues with in customer service you name it we would be selling it all so it's
[37:00.320 --> 37:05.680]  not some differentiation of my filter I sells the best and everybody else is
[37:05.680 --> 37:10.480]  terrible I would be selling all of them that's how I do things okay I would sell
[37:10.480 --> 37:14.080]  everything good I could get my hands on we saw like four different companies of
[37:14.080 --> 37:18.240]  shortwave radios from super expensive not a very inexpensive but not you know
[37:18.240 --> 37:23.960]  not junky that's all available at info or store.com when it comes to
[37:23.960 --> 37:28.160]  supplements we've got the great young gravity supplements at infowarshealth.com
[37:28.160 --> 37:33.320]  the Beyond Tangy Tangerine you name it but we wanted to develop truly original
[37:33.320 --> 37:38.480]  things like the proprietary nason iodine that we quietly believe probably is the
[37:38.480 --> 37:41.360]  only real nason iodine out there truly we've got tests that we're gonna be
[37:41.360 --> 37:46.880]  showing people both late tests and scientific very soon also expanding on
[37:46.880 --> 37:50.040]  that we have the super mill vitality that's so popular you've heard the rave
[37:50.040 --> 37:54.600]  reviews the super feminine vitality just came out we got a limited couple thousand
[37:54.600 --> 38:00.080]  bottles they have effectively sold out as of today but the laboratory knew we
[38:00.080 --> 38:04.200]  would want more without us asking and ran about a thousand more those are being
[38:04.200 --> 38:09.680]  labeled now so we're not going to take it down and say back order right now where
[38:09.680 --> 38:14.400]  you can't even get it we are saying you better get the super feminine vitality
[38:14.400 --> 38:18.920]  right now if you want it it's that popular so when that thousands gone it
[38:18.920 --> 38:25.600]  will take a few weeks to get more the x2 we had a lot of it made multi years in
[38:25.600 --> 38:29.720]  the development and testing the doctor group was putting together and we
[38:29.720 --> 38:33.440]  have the regular super nason iodine survival shield is proprietary that's
[38:33.440 --> 38:36.400]  excellent I believe it's great for kids check with your physician it's not as
[38:36.400 --> 38:41.720]  strong it's excellent I had to build up we even with it I had a toxic detox
[38:41.720 --> 38:45.160]  response that group predicted two weeks he said two weeks to a month in and then
[38:45.160 --> 38:49.120]  it was amazing after my skin cleared up just I never really had bad skin all the
[38:49.120 --> 38:53.240]  stuff came out I lost a bunch of weight more energy it came at a perfect time in
[38:53.240 --> 38:56.520]  my life well he said look he told me a year ago don't come out with us I make
[38:56.520 --> 39:00.040]  something even better I go no you take forever I want to put this out it's great
[39:00.040 --> 39:07.600]  he goes okay then he came out with the new x2 for us proprietary with us and it
[39:07.600 --> 39:12.360]  is it's bright red it's not black or dark brown like the other iodine that you
[39:12.360 --> 39:17.920]  still need obviously but aren't as good from our research and then you had the
[39:17.920 --> 39:22.160]  other more palatable but weaker it was stronger than other items of the similar
[39:22.160 --> 39:26.160]  type but but weaker compared to some of the you know loogles type stuff this new
[39:26.160 --> 39:30.440]  x2 is bright red and it turns bright blue purple on paper like five times
[39:30.440 --> 39:33.800]  darker than our other survival shield and we're still selling both we've
[39:33.800 --> 39:37.240]  discounted the original survival shields additional five dollars and the new
[39:37.240 --> 39:41.240]  survival shields the same price as the old survival shield so x2 and then of
[39:41.240 --> 39:44.320]  course we have the original x1 and I don't really see us coming out with any
[39:44.320 --> 39:48.840]  other x's after this it's just that it's fun in the operation at current sales
[39:48.840 --> 39:52.400]  rates it'll be sold out by the end of the week and then it may be as much as
[39:52.400 --> 39:58.080]  two months till we get more of it we believe it'll be sooner but again these
[39:58.080 --> 40:01.920]  purple crystals that nobody else has the other stuff's out of seaweed I'm not
[40:01.920 --> 40:06.440]  knocking that this is from a mine purple crystals that eat through the floor like
[40:06.440 --> 40:12.040]  in the movie alien when they're not in this gas form put into the tincture
[40:12.040 --> 40:15.920]  that's why it goes right in the blood that's why it's so different that I mean
[40:15.920 --> 40:20.560]  literally real iodine is amazing that's why detoxes it why it's go through the
[40:20.560 --> 40:24.560]  body it's why they put stuff that blocks it in the water because it's
[40:24.560 --> 40:28.320]  incredible I mean I just tried for yourself it's fun in the operation we
[40:28.320 --> 40:30.960]  appreciate all your support but that's how we're able to bring you this
[40:30.960 --> 40:35.240]  information is with revolutionary products like x2 and super feminine
[40:35.240 --> 40:42.800]  vitality and super male vitality at m4store.com or m4slife.com or 888-253-3139
[40:42.800 --> 40:46.240]  now until about five after we'll have Leanne McAdoo and Staff Sergeant Joe
[40:46.240 --> 40:49.120]  Biggs with us I know the calls are coming in from active duty or former
[40:49.120 --> 40:54.280]  military to give us your take on the situation and we'll have we'll have big
[40:54.280 --> 40:58.520]  start going to those calls at about 47 after so at that segment the next
[40:58.520 --> 41:01.360]  segment and then that little segment the start of the next hour but let's go
[41:01.360 --> 41:06.760]  back to Staff Sergeant Joe Biggs again looking at the Bo Bergdahl announcement
[41:06.760 --> 41:10.840]  Obama the CIA section chiefs cover blown we're just trying to find out exactly
[41:10.840 --> 41:14.280]  what's going on here but the story doesn't add up and its own members of
[41:14.280 --> 41:17.520]  his unit are saying that Staff Sergeant Biggs you've got a clip you want to
[41:17.520 --> 41:22.760]  play yeah I wanted everyone to see that a clip from his parents talking to the
[41:22.760 --> 41:26.400]  president of the White House on Saturday I just want to see what everyone
[41:26.400 --> 41:30.360]  thinks about how he reacts and how he's talking to the president and listen to
[41:30.360 --> 41:35.000]  his dialect how he's speaking poshtune and how it's so you know perfect and just
[41:35.000 --> 41:42.680]  on point I'd like to say to Bo right now who's having trouble speaking English
[41:42.680 --> 41:49.320]  Bismillahirrahmanirrahim Zayab-e-Yim I'm your father Bo
[41:49.320 --> 42:00.520]  the people of Afghanistan the same Khalifa Althani I mean what is you he's
[42:00.520 --> 42:04.880]  bringing up that Afghanistan again I mean he is it sounds like his son's been
[42:04.880 --> 42:08.280]  trained to super deep cover for this mission all along to penetrate their
[42:08.280 --> 42:13.920]  network yeah definitely I mean I think he was in he had to have been in contact
[42:13.920 --> 42:18.320]  with the Hukhani network as well to keep up his dialect and to be able to keep
[42:18.320 --> 42:21.760]  speaking that way I mean they he had to be doing some negotiations for a long
[42:21.760 --> 42:26.000]  time himself I don't know what you know and and of course five years your son
[42:26.000 --> 42:29.680]  gone you would learn how to do this stuff but but I mean you you told me
[42:29.680 --> 42:32.720]  that's one of the hardest languages to understand or speak correctly yeah I
[42:32.720 --> 42:36.860]  mean when I was over there I had to use a Rosetta Stone and when you're in the
[42:36.860 --> 42:40.760]  Army they give you a free copy of that you're able to go on and and learn
[42:40.760 --> 42:43.680]  languages like that so when I was over there I was able to pick it up for a
[42:43.680 --> 42:47.280]  little bit of time you know learn how to ride a little bit as well but once you
[42:47.280 --> 42:50.720]  get back and you don't have anybody to talk to that goes away really fast I
[42:50.720 --> 42:57.400]  mean I don't know who he's talking to in Idaho to be able to to keep that up at
[42:57.400 --> 43:02.840]  all but also I want to go to I mean to copy a Texas accent properly you need
[43:02.840 --> 43:06.320]  to live here years and years and years it's the same deal I mean how does he in
[43:06.320 --> 43:11.160]  Idaho speak with a you're saying that Pashtun accent sounds dead on or close
[43:11.160 --> 43:16.120]  that's very close I mean it's not easy I mean I've heard a lot of Americans who
[43:16.120 --> 43:19.840]  are interpreters who learn the language and they don't come off as comfortable
[43:19.840 --> 43:23.640]  and as well versus he does in that you know in that interview with the
[43:23.640 --> 43:26.720]  president and he's doing it with the president on national television yes
[43:26.720 --> 43:31.400]  smiling patting each other on the back you know having a good old time do we
[43:31.400 --> 43:36.080]  have any callers yet on the board there staff sergeant um yes I see okay well
[43:36.080 --> 43:39.800]  just just be ready to go to those after we get Leanne's take on this Leanne
[43:39.800 --> 43:44.120]  McAdoo what is your take on this I know you've been researching this the last
[43:44.120 --> 43:48.920]  few days and you have have your perspective on it well it's all kind of
[43:48.920 --> 43:53.160]  throwing me off I was celebrating my little brother's graduation when they
[43:53.160 --> 43:56.840]  announced this on Saturday so I really didn't know who they were even speaking
[43:56.840 --> 44:02.960]  about I just saw you know the the line there POW had been released and so I was
[44:02.960 --> 44:08.040]  just kind of watching it you know watching Obama you know and his demeanor
[44:08.040 --> 44:12.320]  and just looking at it thinking wow this his dad you know that's just someone
[44:12.320 --> 44:16.240]  you don't really ever see this big bearded guy and here I'm thinking he's
[44:16.240 --> 44:20.560]  probably you know just some farmer or something like or some big bearded
[44:20.560 --> 44:25.520]  patriot dude just you know out there with Obama and then he gets up and he you
[44:25.520 --> 44:29.640]  can you can really see in his demeanor though just the way that he was even
[44:29.640 --> 44:34.520]  interacting with Obama and Obama says I want the father to speak and then if the
[44:34.520 --> 44:37.560]  mother has anything to add you know we'll let that happen and they didn't
[44:37.560 --> 44:41.360]  even listen to him they did she spoke and then he went up and speaking you
[44:41.360 --> 44:47.920]  could see Obama's face the way that he reacts to the Bob Bergdahl's father
[44:47.920 --> 44:52.720]  speaking in Pashtun like he wasn't expecting that to happen and then he
[44:52.720 --> 44:57.840]  addresses the Afghan people directly and that's what you know the son was there
[44:57.840 --> 45:02.160]  that he was so disappointed about because he thought he was going to help
[45:02.160 --> 45:06.040]  the people of Afghanistan and then he gets there and finds out it's that's not
[45:06.040 --> 45:12.240]  the case at all so did his father at some point become a sympathizer with him
[45:12.240 --> 45:16.360]  as well or I mean clearly like he's got well that is Stockholm syndrome I mean
[45:16.360 --> 45:20.160]  this could just be Stockholm syndrome that more and more people and Americans
[45:20.160 --> 45:24.400]  are primed for this now that that when they're under an oppressor they tend to
[45:24.400 --> 45:27.840]  start worshiping the oppressor and that explains the worship of our big fat out
[45:27.840 --> 45:32.080]  of control evil government that could be it too he could be he's deep cover to
[45:32.080 --> 45:36.520]  infiltrate the group well that was my first instinct that was my that's what
[45:36.520 --> 45:39.080]  you told me Saturday well yeah well because I didn't know who they were
[45:39.080 --> 45:43.080]  speaking about and then I just see him the man come out speak Pashtun and say
[45:43.080 --> 45:46.040]  we're you know thank you so much for everyone that's helped and then I was
[45:46.040 --> 45:50.680]  like man that guy is deep cover that's that's deep cover right there that
[45:50.680 --> 45:54.800]  they're getting that his kid out now who had gone to you know such lengths to
[45:54.800 --> 46:01.440]  assimilate into this network and then his father as well I mean that's to me
[46:01.440 --> 46:04.480]  that's my first instinct well show that a Bret Bart article real quick if you
[46:04.480 --> 46:09.120]  don't mind and it's titled it did the Obama White House trade five terrorists
[46:09.120 --> 46:14.200]  for Taliban sympathizer it says in 2010 the Taliban claimed that Sergeant Bo
[46:14.200 --> 46:18.440]  Bergdahl had converted to Islam and had taught them bomb-making techniques
[46:18.440 --> 46:22.520]  Bergdahl had also changed his name to Abdullah you know this is very
[46:22.520 --> 46:26.840]  comparable to the tell of Sergeant Brody and the homeland show on showtime
[46:26.840 --> 46:29.840]  that's what I'm glad you said that I was thinking about that last night and
[46:29.840 --> 46:33.200]  forgotten that's what the angle we need to look at here because I'm telling you
[46:33.200 --> 46:36.440]  they have this narrative on all these shows like homeland and cartoons and
[46:36.440 --> 46:39.840]  everywhere that the vets are going to be the terrorist that the vets have all
[46:39.840 --> 46:43.800]  turned to Taliban they've all turned to Al Qaeda they're all going to attack you
[46:43.800 --> 46:48.760]  which is ridiculous so they have to manufacture it then in this narrative to
[46:48.760 --> 46:52.840]  make the troops and the Tea Party the new Al Qaeda I've been writing articles
[46:52.840 --> 46:55.920]  for six years about how they were going to claim white Al Qaeda and claim this
[46:55.920 --> 46:59.240]  narrative because we got some of their internal documents that we published
[46:59.240 --> 47:04.040]  obviously and then here we are you know saying why we don't trust it that's
[47:04.040 --> 47:06.960]  because our subconscious has all this data we've already covered in thousands
[47:06.960 --> 47:11.160]  of shows and now it's bubbling out that's the angle right there bigs you just
[47:11.160 --> 47:16.800]  hit it right exactly well we were speaking you know on Saturday just
[47:16.800 --> 47:20.280]  watching this and bigs is like well the real story is the fact that we traded
[47:20.280 --> 47:23.880]  these five terrorists for this one soldier that's going to set an awful
[47:23.880 --> 47:28.080]  precedent but less than 24 hours you know usually the media would just say
[47:28.080 --> 47:33.480]  well Obama says this guy's a hero case closed and let's move on less than 24
[47:33.480 --> 47:38.400]  hours later they are already all these articles with all this backstory saying
[47:38.400 --> 47:43.520]  is this did we just you know rescue this guy who had defected anyway and so they
[47:43.520 --> 47:47.800]  were all immediately going with this different story and so I was talking to
[47:47.800 --> 47:52.240]  bigs like you know we've got the the photos that surfaced of the first white
[47:52.240 --> 47:57.480]  suicide bomber and how this was a foreign policy I believe who's saying
[47:57.480 --> 48:01.720]  that the big fear is that Americans teaming up with al-Qaeda affiliated
[48:01.720 --> 48:07.760]  groups will return to the US to conduct terrorist attacks and so now they're
[48:07.760 --> 48:13.320]  kind of pulling in this whole story I was talking to my buddy yesterday Jason
[48:13.320 --> 48:17.240]  Leopold and the FBI likes to call him the aphobia terrorist and you know I
[48:17.240 --> 48:20.480]  wanted to throw a few of these things by him as well and one of the things he
[48:20.480 --> 48:24.440]  had mentioned was he's like he's like remember that that email you got from
[48:24.440 --> 48:27.840]  Hastings and he said that the FBI was coming after him and we're looking for
[48:27.840 --> 48:31.760]  him and I go yeah he's like I think this is what it was about because if you
[48:31.760 --> 48:36.640]  remember Hastings last article was America's last prisoner of war and it
[48:36.640 --> 48:41.360]  was about Bo Bergall at the time and wait it's all coming together yeah I'd
[48:41.360 --> 48:44.320]  forgotten you'd said that you need to get your buddy on the show can you do
[48:44.320 --> 48:48.880]  that um possibly I'll give him a call again today and see what he can do well
[48:48.880 --> 48:52.480]  let's do it tomorrow yeah but I mean wait a minute wait a minute wait a minute
[48:52.480 --> 48:57.000]  I forgot Hastings did an article about this you were just mentioning it oh my
[48:57.000 --> 49:01.720]  gosh this this really oh my so so what does your buddy think I mean we all
[49:01.720 --> 49:05.760]  think this is connected now you know with the death and all that as well he
[49:05.760 --> 49:10.160]  he honestly thinks that the FBI was after him because of this you know and
[49:10.160 --> 49:14.240]  shortly after his death he says you know the FBI released a statement saying we
[49:14.240 --> 49:18.320]  have nothing to do with this but after many aphobia attempts all that it come
[49:18.320 --> 49:22.120]  you know it's come to light that the FBI was looking into him because of his
[49:22.120 --> 49:25.560]  interest in Bo Bergall and they found a very disturbing and they called that
[49:25.560 --> 49:31.560]  controversial journalism that's right and you talked about this months ago on
[49:31.560 --> 49:36.040]  the show so here we are talking about Bo Bergall in this months ago in
[49:36.040 --> 49:40.720]  association with Hastings death and we know the FBI visited his house or we
[49:40.720 --> 49:44.000]  know the Fed showed up we know his wife who you went to the funeral who you
[49:44.000 --> 49:48.640]  knew said that you know she was mad and upset then she goes on seeing him with
[49:48.640 --> 49:52.600]  Pears Morgan and says everything's wonderful like a Stepford wife I mean
[49:52.600 --> 49:57.200]  this is really starting to smell coming full circle and she was the head
[49:57.200 --> 50:01.960]  assistant to the National Security Council I mean that's the top of the
[50:01.960 --> 50:06.480]  pyramid that's the top of the black box government I mean that's who runs
[50:06.480 --> 50:10.680]  Homeland Security that's who runs the dictatorship that's it I mean this whole
[50:10.680 --> 50:14.960]  story stinks I don't believe a lick of it it's another looks like you said
[50:14.960 --> 50:18.360]  Hastings would be in like bombs and missiles blowing up in huge battles
[50:18.360 --> 50:21.600]  with you and he was just totally relaxed and smiling you never saw their
[50:21.600 --> 50:24.320]  journalists that acted like that and you know you said on record you think
[50:24.320 --> 50:28.680]  Hastings was some type of operative I mean he was down in there and another
[50:28.680 --> 50:32.880]  thing that was well those he thought that you know for a while he thought his
[50:32.880 --> 50:37.800]  wife was almost kind of sent there is a mole too to well of course of course

[52:56.040 --> 52:59.520]  the direction this country was headed and the Charlottes willing to sell us out
[52:59.520 --> 53:03.840]  for a quick buck deciding to take action a company run by patriots for

[54:35.080 --> 54:39.320]  with a couple of my friends today and one of the guys actually went to that
[54:39.320 --> 54:45.680]  base that the guy left from and the guy when he was there the guys that were
[54:45.680 --> 54:50.240]  there the the troops over there were telling him about how the guy walked up
[54:50.240 --> 54:56.000]  latest gear down the gate and walked out so you you were wondering about but
[54:56.000 --> 55:01.080]  whether this story is actual or not yet yeah yeah I walked up latest gear down
[55:01.080 --> 55:06.640]  and walked away told him I'm going home and then the first sergeant there came
[55:06.640 --> 55:09.440]  up the guy said why did you let him leave and they were like well he's a
[55:09.440 --> 55:15.560]  grown man what are we gonna do shoot him you know so yeah the story where the
[55:15.560 --> 55:19.400]  story is true that he walked up and walked out
[55:19.600 --> 55:24.600]  wow any other tidbits or any other questions you'd like to ask this fellow
[55:24.600 --> 55:31.760]  bigs oh no not at all thank well I mean that's what they're saying people in the
[55:31.760 --> 55:38.160]  unit are saying on CNN so this is blowing up an Obama's face caller Mark and
[55:38.160 --> 55:42.080]  Afghanistan what is your gut tell you is going on did your buddies that were at
[55:42.080 --> 55:45.520]  this pace did they have any idea what was really going on more than just
[55:45.520 --> 55:52.240]  saying that it looked like he won a wall no it's just this guy just flipped out
[55:52.240 --> 55:56.640]  the way that he done out here you know the you have one guy that flipped out and
[55:56.640 --> 56:00.440]  went then you shot a bunch of people out there this guy that walked away you have
[56:00.440 --> 56:04.160]  people out here capping themselves I've heard other I've heard soldiers talking
[56:04.160 --> 56:08.640]  about other soldiers capping themselves you know they're kind of like well why
[56:08.640 --> 56:15.280]  you know I mean you know some you know for the people that have been out I mean
[56:15.280 --> 56:21.600]  I've been out doing jobs I'm an employee of the military industrial complex if you
[56:21.600 --> 56:28.600]  will and I've been out where face has been attacked you know and it's I don't
[56:28.600 --> 56:32.600]  know I guess I just didn't get rattled like some people do I guess but some
[56:32.600 --> 56:38.640]  people can't handle it but why they do what they do like I don't know nobody
[56:38.640 --> 56:44.200]  mark very very interesting information thank you so much Joe and Connecticut
[56:44.200 --> 56:49.160]  Army vet what's your take on this Alex you know one of the first things that I
[56:49.160 --> 56:52.080]  wondered because I mean I've been following this story since the beginning
[56:52.080 --> 56:55.800]  when when he did walk away from the base and and soldier flipped out and went
[56:55.800 --> 57:00.160]  crazy was I was wondering how he got off but he wasn't captured by the Taliban
[57:00.160 --> 57:03.880]  Sergeant Big touched on this like the Taliban wouldn't keep him alive for five
[57:03.880 --> 57:09.120]  years he's unless he assimilated into them he I mean they would look at him as
[57:09.120 --> 57:12.880]  the infidel less than nothing and and immediately dispatch home I mean they
[57:12.880 --> 57:16.600]  wouldn't they wouldn't keep him alive for five years but I find the timing of it
[57:16.600 --> 57:20.440]  so funny because it just totally takes the heat off the VA scandal and and
[57:20.440 --> 57:26.080]  everything else like being totally changes the subject off the VA oh man I
[57:26.080 --> 57:28.360]  tell you these callers really are putting the pieces together I mean one of
[57:28.360 --> 57:31.480]  the things though too when I was in Iraq I remember watching the video of one of
[57:31.480 --> 57:36.800]  the soldiers having his head sawed off I mean that is a chilling image that will
[57:36.800 --> 57:40.760]  never leave my mind and the last thing I would ever do was walk off of a base
[57:40.760 --> 57:44.040]  because I know in the back of my head that I could get my head chopped off I
[57:44.040 --> 57:48.800]  know if I fell behind in a in a ruckmarch I could get my head chopped off you
[57:48.800 --> 57:52.920]  know my cousin was telling me about how off of a base is because you know you
[57:52.920 --> 57:57.480]  have nothing to fear that's what that's another scary thing is he walked off the
[57:57.480 --> 58:00.200]  base and didn't even think alright I'm gonna get my head chopped off the
[58:00.200 --> 58:05.720]  Hikani Network is known as the Sopranos of Afghanistan I mean these are bad guys
[58:05.720 --> 58:10.040]  they were I was about to say my cousin was was given back up to these Medevac
[58:10.040 --> 58:13.920]  helicopters where they're all these burned kids on a road and when they got
[58:13.920 --> 58:16.960]  there they'd burned their own kids up and then they came out with bombs to try
[58:16.960 --> 58:19.640]  to blow them up but they'd already figured it out and they landed their
[58:19.640 --> 58:23.000]  helicopters further away but I mean that's the total brainwashing we're
[58:23.000 --> 58:26.920]  talking about here amazing thank you Staff Sergeant Joe Biggs thank you Joe
[58:26.920 --> 58:32.040]  and Connecticut yeah this diverts off I guess it's a new Malaysian plane story
[58:32.040 --> 58:37.800]  from the VA scandal that was absolutely exposing them Chris Sean and Billy your

[59:01.680 --> 59:05.200]  to five times higher concentrations of pollutants than even outdoor air and

[59:17.800 --> 59:20.960]  don't forget the fact that six million Americans live with pets they're

[01:00:32.600 --> 01:00:38.120]  the bold burgdoll story the last article written by he had more articles
[01:00:38.120 --> 01:00:41.800]  coming out Michael Hastings was on this notice we have one of his good buddies
[01:00:41.800 --> 01:00:45.280]  Staff Sergeant Joe Biggs working for info wars he's been saying these are
[01:00:45.280 --> 01:00:49.240]  connected for a long time since he died I don't know six eight months ago ever
[01:00:49.240 --> 01:00:53.520]  long ago it was maybe a year time flies how long has Hastings been dead now Joe
[01:00:53.520 --> 01:00:57.400]  it'll be a year June 18th so we're coming right up on it right now so almost a
[01:00:57.400 --> 01:01:00.720]  year and we got to go back to all those shows where you mentioned it might have
[01:01:00.720 --> 01:01:04.880]  been the bold burgdoll case I remember rolling my eyes what's a POW you have to
[01:01:04.880 --> 01:01:09.320]  do with it I mean this is really getting serious now folks and as usual we're
[01:01:09.320 --> 01:01:12.840]  right on top of what's going on we just haven't figured it out yet because we're
[01:01:12.840 --> 01:01:16.640]  always in the middle of it to begin with but Leanne McAdoo's riding shotgun
[01:01:16.640 --> 01:01:21.080]  Steve Pachennick's coming up to give his take and Leanne and Joe can have a
[01:01:21.080 --> 01:01:26.160]  roundtable discussion with callers Chris in Nevada Army and law enforcement vet
[01:01:26.160 --> 01:01:31.680]  what is your take on this whole story all right Alex thank you for this provocative
[01:01:31.680 --> 01:01:35.280]  truth-based journalism that you're doing this morning and perhaps off to
[01:01:35.280 --> 01:01:40.800]  Sgt. Bugdoll Bergberg's for his service my apologies thank you brother what do
[01:01:40.800 --> 01:01:45.640]  you think's going on here couple of factoids one whenever this purported
[01:01:45.640 --> 01:01:50.840]  father Robert Bergdoll is making his announcement and the wife is speaking
[01:01:50.840 --> 01:01:56.440]  look at him in the background observed he has a very pronounced closing of his
[01:01:56.440 --> 01:02:01.720]  right eye leading the left eye open specifically almost like a wink in the
[01:02:01.720 --> 01:02:07.120]  nod signals to somebody don't know who but it's very obvious he's communicating
[01:02:07.120 --> 01:02:11.720]  in some sort of fashion to alert someone just like in the show homeland how
[01:02:11.720 --> 01:02:17.200]  Sgt. Brody does the same thing as finger tappings when he was sending the
[01:02:17.200 --> 01:02:20.760]  videos back home when he was being held captive it's the same thing I think he's
[01:02:20.760 --> 01:02:26.080]  kind of sending some kind of code over that video doing that absolutely also
[01:02:26.080 --> 01:02:32.560]  when you look at hagels coming out and trying to claim that capitulation and
[01:02:32.560 --> 01:02:39.040]  negotiation with terrorist is merely hostage negotiation it speaks to the
[01:02:39.040 --> 01:02:43.680]  lies that they're trying to fabricate in this rhetoric based story followed by
[01:02:43.680 --> 01:02:49.320]  Susan lice's coming forward him hauling around stuttering her lack of
[01:02:49.320 --> 01:02:53.320]  credibility based upon her lies perpetrated in the big Aussie scam with
[01:02:53.320 --> 01:02:58.280]  Hillary Clinton just really have destroyed any pretense of credibility
[01:02:58.280 --> 01:03:03.080]  she may have ever had and she seems to be a agent of Valerie Jenrett in the
[01:03:03.080 --> 01:03:09.160]  White House the real talking hand for the puppet Obama but these are really
[01:03:09.160 --> 01:03:15.160]  things that fly in the face and like you say his perfect speaking of posh tune
[01:03:15.160 --> 01:03:21.400]  really just defied any concept of normality for an American unless they
[01:03:21.400 --> 01:03:26.640]  have absolutely been schooled in that particular language for a lengthy time
[01:03:26.640 --> 01:03:29.880]  yeah I agree with you a hundred percent on that I mean he's got and that means
[01:03:29.880 --> 01:03:34.360]  towards him being an infiltrator for some agency not not actually being a
[01:03:34.360 --> 01:03:40.880]  double or or or going over to the Afghans and and so in my gut that tells
[01:03:40.880 --> 01:03:44.680]  me this is part of a whole new roll out that oh look the tea party and the
[01:03:44.680 --> 01:03:49.560]  soldiers are Al Qaeda which we see them actually trying to promote right now in
[01:03:49.560 --> 01:03:54.000]  the news flipping homeland security on to the American people your take on that
[01:03:54.000 --> 01:03:57.240]  Chris and then Joe Biggs
[01:03:59.200 --> 01:04:07.480]  agent revocateur mask as a jihadi terrorist in truth that's what I think
[01:04:07.480 --> 01:04:11.640]  well that color really says it well agent revocateur mask as a jihadi
[01:04:11.640 --> 01:04:15.440]  terrorist Joe big so one of the other things though that Lee and I spoke about
[01:04:15.440 --> 01:04:20.760]  yesterday or the day before was that maybe this is really all about the father
[01:04:20.760 --> 01:04:26.040]  maybe he's the one who is the actual you know the operative and did something
[01:04:26.040 --> 01:04:31.720]  and the son had to go in almost as what was it we were saying yesterday I remember
[01:04:31.720 --> 01:04:35.160]  that we were saying that we were thinking that the the father was the one
[01:04:35.160 --> 01:04:38.480]  who was actually working for the CIA and he had done something as you can see
[01:04:38.480 --> 01:04:41.560]  when he's talking to the president he has that snarl look you know most kind of
[01:04:41.560 --> 01:04:45.680]  like ha you know negotiate yeah to get his son well bottom line they're covering
[01:04:45.680 --> 01:04:49.320]  something up and then this is distracting from the VA scandal and I
[01:04:49.320 --> 01:04:52.040]  don't believe a word of it and now we remember Hastings was hot on the trail of
[01:04:52.040 --> 01:04:55.600]  us I mean this is big we'll be right back and we'll get more from Lee and
[01:04:55.600 --> 01:04:59.280]  Macadoo and Steve Puchinac and Joe Biggs stay with us
[01:04:59.280 --> 01:05:04.000]  I don't know what it is Ralph just won't pay any attention to me when he comes
[01:05:04.000 --> 01:05:08.040]  home from work all he ever does is play video games and go to sleep just like I

[01:08:31.360 --> 01:08:35.800]  segments on for a lot more today to cover the waterfront of propaganda this
[01:08:35.800 --> 01:08:40.440]  information and more popping in on very short notice is dr. Steve Pacinic
[01:08:40.440 --> 01:08:45.400]  former head of psychological operations for the State Department co-author with
[01:08:45.400 --> 01:08:52.240]  Tom Clancy and you know kind of a master negotiator in his own right and
[01:08:52.240 --> 01:08:58.040]  listen I don't know his take on this bow burgdoll army report I just know that
[01:08:58.040 --> 01:09:01.920]  when it all happened I went haven't I heard that before and then it was the
[01:09:01.920 --> 01:09:05.880]  story Hastings was working on he already done one when he got his car got
[01:09:05.880 --> 01:09:10.200]  blown up out in California and then the wife was getting threatened and
[01:09:10.200 --> 01:09:14.200]  everything and then she goes on TV and says everything's fine she's the head
[01:09:14.200 --> 01:09:17.760]  you know minion at the National Security Council doesn't get any more high
[01:09:17.760 --> 01:09:21.520]  level than that I mean you know in those meetings like eight people she's
[01:09:21.520 --> 01:09:26.760]  in there I mean I think both of them have the cutouts of spies of some agency
[01:09:26.760 --> 01:09:31.280]  and and bigs knew him you know Esquire articles in serious combat and he said
[01:09:31.280 --> 01:09:34.320]  all other media would basically freak out bigs just loved it was smiling and
[01:09:34.320 --> 01:09:38.760]  enjoying you know rockets falling all around them or you know bigs was saying
[01:09:38.760 --> 01:09:42.680]  that about Hastings staff sergeant Joe bigs who works for him full wars.com and
[01:09:42.680 --> 01:09:49.960]  now you have bow burgdoll and his dad if you just joined us his own buddy saying
[01:09:49.960 --> 01:09:53.720]  no he walked off the base he went AWOL well bigs was telling me that days ago
[01:09:53.720 --> 01:09:57.040]  when this first broke and I said I can't find that we're not we're not gonna go
[01:09:57.040 --> 01:10:00.960]  with that well now it came out what bigs said bigs has friends that were in the
[01:10:00.960 --> 01:10:04.680]  unit with him and we've got contractors calling in saying no no I mean we know
[01:10:04.680 --> 01:10:07.840]  people on the base same thing happened he left he said he was going same thing
[01:10:07.840 --> 01:10:11.800]  CNN's reporting so there's a lot of issues here I want Leanne McAddy to be
[01:10:11.800 --> 01:10:15.720]  able to ask some questions and I also want to get Joe bigs to be able to ask
[01:10:15.720 --> 01:10:21.520]  some and kind of recap this but just briefly because I appreciate you popping
[01:10:21.520 --> 01:10:26.600]  on short notice you were just on the Sunday show as Dr. Steve Pachinic what
[01:10:26.600 --> 01:10:30.120]  what do you know about this because sometimes you know what happened or what
[01:10:30.120 --> 01:10:34.360]  is your take on it are we wrong to think this doesn't make sense with the CIA boss
[01:10:34.360 --> 01:10:39.240]  in Kabul getting his cover blown by Obama two weeks ago and then now this
[01:10:39.240 --> 01:10:44.560]  happens was this guy's is this guy a deep cover infiltrator into the Taliban
[01:10:44.560 --> 01:10:48.840]  into the economy network dr. Pachinic what do you know well what I know is I'm
[01:10:48.840 --> 01:10:53.600]  going to give you a very special unusual story that will show you the
[01:10:53.600 --> 01:10:58.960]  hypocrisy and inconsistency of this administration one month ago I was all
[01:10:58.960 --> 01:11:04.200]  I was served a subpoena by the FBI on behalf of the US Attorney of the Southern
[01:11:04.200 --> 01:11:10.040]  District of Florida by the name of Brian Fraser at the behest of the Justice
[01:11:10.040 --> 01:11:15.080]  Department Eric Holder and at the behest of Cecilia Altonaga United States
[01:11:15.080 --> 01:11:19.560]  Supreme Court district judge requesting my presence and the potential
[01:11:19.560 --> 01:11:25.240]  indictment for having non-negotiated against terrorists 35 years ago at the
[01:11:25.240 --> 01:11:29.720]  US military officer and deputy assistant secretary of state and I was brought in
[01:11:29.720 --> 01:11:34.880]  on charges of criminal charges for doing exactly the opposite and being
[01:11:34.880 --> 01:11:39.040]  consistent with our policy of no negotiation with a red brigade terrorist
[01:11:39.040 --> 01:11:45.680]  and as a result the Aldo Maro the prime minister of Italy died 35 years later
[01:11:45.680 --> 01:11:50.120]  the State Department and the Justice Department under the orders of Obama has
[01:11:50.120 --> 01:11:56.720]  ordered me to appear before the court just one week ago May 27th 2014 at 10
[01:11:56.720 --> 01:12:02.520]  a.m. in front of Brian Fraser in front of an Italian prosecutor at the behest of
[01:12:02.520 --> 01:12:06.240]  the Italian prosecutor with the overlying notion that I will be
[01:12:06.240 --> 01:12:12.960]  committed for criminal indictment if I don't reveal what I had done in saving
[01:12:12.960 --> 01:12:17.480]  Italy and refusing to negotiate with terrorists so what this shows and what
[01:12:17.480 --> 01:12:21.640]  this just happened to me and you're the only one to know now the case number is
[01:12:21.640 --> 01:12:28.720]  here at 14 mc 213 80 Altonaga the judge was out to Naga the attorney general was
[01:12:28.720 --> 01:12:34.160]  Brian Fraser and I was brought up on charges that I potentially have killed
[01:12:34.160 --> 01:12:39.960]  a prime minister because I refused to negotiate in a time of war with Aldo
[01:12:39.960 --> 01:12:46.480]  Maro with his red brigade I was a US military officer in combat and I was a
[01:12:46.480 --> 01:12:51.680]  deputy assistant secretary under Jimmy Carter and for the very opposite reasons
[01:12:51.680 --> 01:12:55.880]  that this president who's been a total hypocrite and a total incompetent along
[01:12:55.880 --> 01:13:02.800]  with Harry hold Eric Holder and the US military they have negotiated with the
[01:13:02.800 --> 01:13:08.200]  terrorist allowed a deserter this is a deserter this is not an infiltrator to
[01:13:08.200 --> 01:13:13.720]  leave his post he should have been jailed stockaded and incarcerated and he is
[01:13:13.720 --> 01:13:19.280]  not a prisoner of war he is a deserter he should have been tried I in turn have
[01:13:19.280 --> 01:13:25.120]  been tried for saving my country saving Italy and I've had to pay $20,000 to a
[01:13:25.120 --> 01:13:29.080]  lawyer just to show up to explain why I by the way Dr. Pachinic I've got to
[01:13:29.080 --> 01:13:33.240]  interrupt you and we'll go to our guests at 33 after this is too important but for
[01:13:33.240 --> 01:13:36.400]  people that don't know Dr. Pachinic will never talk about this on air but I've
[01:13:36.400 --> 01:13:40.280]  gone and checked into him over the years it's an 11 independent the BBC and
[01:13:40.280 --> 01:13:44.680]  LaFigaro and France and the biggest papers in Italy that where they say
[01:13:44.680 --> 01:13:48.960]  Dr. Steve Pachinic killed the Prime Minister by manipulating the Red
[01:13:48.960 --> 01:13:53.400]  Brigade and not negotiating and then they killed him which is crazy because how
[01:13:53.400 --> 01:13:57.200]  is not negotiating killing him when they're the ones that killed him so
[01:13:57.200 --> 01:14:02.080]  that's in the papers 10 years ago 20 years ago 5 years ago you can look up
[01:14:02.080 --> 01:14:05.840]  Dr. Steve Pachinic and that's pretty much what you get on him I mean you know
[01:14:05.840 --> 01:14:09.400]  running those operations with the army and others and of course he helped found
[01:14:09.400 --> 01:14:13.320]  Delta Force with General Boykin who's also a listener of the show and what I
[01:14:13.320 --> 01:14:17.360]  can't believe here is we get him on about this and he drops this bombshell
[01:14:17.360 --> 01:14:20.920]  you didn't tell us that dr. Pachinic was it was it sealed what happened in the
[01:14:20.920 --> 01:14:24.600]  court is it because I couldn't say a word to you or anybody else but since I
[01:14:24.600 --> 01:14:28.880]  appeared in May 27th in front of a prosecutor who was flown over from
[01:14:28.880 --> 01:14:33.560]  Italy we had an interpreter this is all American tax dollars plus we had Brian
[01:14:33.560 --> 01:14:37.600]  Fraser sitting there I had a higher lawyer for $20,000 but what I want to
[01:14:37.600 --> 01:14:40.600]  say was this under a national security order because I don't want to violate
[01:14:40.600 --> 01:14:44.320]  now it's not under national security or as a matter of fact this is a totally
[01:14:44.320 --> 01:14:48.920]  illegal procedure because they brought in a former military officer in a
[01:14:48.920 --> 01:14:52.680]  civilian court and they didn't even know I was a military officer at the time
[01:14:52.680 --> 01:14:57.160]  because I was a deputy assistant secretary of state for counterterrorism
[01:14:57.160 --> 01:15:02.760]  and management and so what happened is the military the CIA our Justice
[01:15:02.760 --> 01:15:07.560]  Department State Department completely abandoned me as a former officer of
[01:15:07.560 --> 01:15:11.600]  the military and now they're saying that they always leave they never leave
[01:15:11.600 --> 01:15:15.680]  anybody behind it's an absolute lie General Dempsey should resign
[01:15:15.680 --> 01:15:19.680]  Tegel should resign the president of the United States should be impeached for
[01:15:19.680 --> 01:15:24.160]  violation of constitutional orders and the fact that he has committed crimes
[01:15:24.160 --> 01:15:30.360]  this person that they exchanged prisoners for was a deserter I was at
[01:15:30.360 --> 01:15:35.840]  principle hostage negotiation and created that no negotiation hostage by the way
[01:15:35.840 --> 01:15:39.680]  you're on record as the head psychiatrist over the Psiop to be able to get
[01:15:39.680 --> 01:15:43.160]  the camp David as well assistant secretary staying one of the first I had
[01:15:43.160 --> 01:15:47.840]  just saved over 500 hostages and I'm not the Muslim I was asked by Secretary of
[01:15:47.840 --> 01:15:53.400]  State Cyrus fans at the behest of Jimmy Carter and at the behest of Warren
[01:15:53.400 --> 01:15:57.240]  Christopher to go over to Italy it was Prime Minister Kosiga he was the
[01:15:57.240 --> 01:16:00.400]  Interior Minister let me ask you a question are they going after you now
[01:16:00.400 --> 01:16:03.160]  because what you're saying on this show you know they're purging a lot of
[01:16:03.160 --> 01:16:06.960]  people right for this was before no no I know this happened a long time ago but
[01:16:06.960 --> 01:16:09.960]  they're gonna use why are they coming after you now is what I'm saying I have
[01:16:09.960 --> 01:16:14.720]  no idea because they believe that as a result of my actions of no negotiation
[01:16:14.720 --> 01:16:18.120]  with the terrorists which is exactly what we've been doing our entire life
[01:16:18.120 --> 01:16:22.920]  where I've saved countless thousands of Italians I saved the country of Italy
[01:16:22.920 --> 01:16:28.480]  from being totally devalued and and be stabilized they are now going there for
[01:16:28.480 --> 01:16:31.320]  those that don't know the communists we're gonna take Italy over and the
[01:16:31.320 --> 01:16:36.840]  communists and the communists the TCI under Berlinger refused to support the
[01:16:36.840 --> 01:16:41.680]  Red Brigade so what you have is a situation where the president abandoned
[01:16:41.680 --> 01:16:46.560]  a soldier like me the military I had requested that our military help me they
[01:16:46.560 --> 01:16:51.840]  abandoned me the CIA abandoned me you talk about justice abandoned me you
[01:16:51.840 --> 01:16:56.000]  talking about State Department Kerry and in contrast they're telling you how
[01:16:56.000 --> 01:17:00.600]  great they are in a situation where you have a deserter and a man who didn't
[01:17:00.600 --> 01:17:06.240]  serve our country and who became an ally of the Alpeida unit of the I know and
[01:17:06.240 --> 01:17:10.000]  they're spinning it they're spinning and then his dad speaks perfect perfect
[01:17:10.000 --> 01:17:13.960]  Farsi Joe Biggs staff sergeant Joe Biggs says none of this smells right to him
[01:17:13.960 --> 01:17:20.720]  Joe Leanne McAdoo do you have any questions for Dr. Pachennick? Well one of the things I
[01:17:20.720 --> 01:17:24.440]  wanted to ask though was you know how many American lives you think are gonna
[01:17:24.440 --> 01:17:30.160]  be endangered now by us negotiating with terrorists now my answer let me just say
[01:17:30.160 --> 01:17:35.520]  this is Dr. Pachennick my answers every US officer every US non-commissioned
[01:17:35.520 --> 01:17:40.680]  individual and every covert operative from 15 different intelligence units
[01:17:40.680 --> 01:17:46.040]  including the CIA the NSA the NGA and almost every American who's out there
[01:17:46.040 --> 01:17:50.440]  serving our country and it's just unbelievable I mean like you said the
[01:17:50.440 --> 01:17:55.600]  president should be impeached on us I mean this is what is Obama doing it
[01:17:55.600 --> 01:17:59.800]  seems like he's going crazy well I don't know if he's going crazy but he's
[01:17:59.800 --> 01:18:04.400]  completely incompetent from the Benghazi issue to the Osama bin Laden to New
[01:18:04.400 --> 01:18:08.960]  Town to the Santa Barbara to the fact that he keeps on he has no idea of what
[01:18:08.960 --> 01:18:13.400]  he's doing he is incompetent in any situation in any government I've
[01:18:13.400 --> 01:18:16.560]  served five different presidents and continue to work with our Defense
[01:18:16.560 --> 01:18:20.400]  Department I have never seen such incompetence he has nothing to do with
[01:18:20.400 --> 01:18:25.160]  the Democrat Republican or whether he's black or white the man has never had any
[01:18:25.160 --> 01:18:29.960]  experience he's never managed the system and he has no idea of what our history
[01:18:29.960 --> 01:18:34.360]  is he's also got a bunch of foundation heads who've never even been in the
[01:18:34.360 --> 01:18:37.760]  military and I'm not putting down that they're women but it is a bunch of
[01:18:37.760 --> 01:18:42.480]  women I mean that he's got running the State Department and everything who
[01:18:42.480 --> 01:18:46.640]  just want to I mean it seems crazy well there's no excuse for John Kerry who's
[01:18:46.640 --> 01:18:53.280]  a senator there was a combat veteran in Vietnam not to know our policy and to
[01:18:53.280 --> 01:18:57.880]  have accepted this there's absolutely no excuse to Chuck Eagle whom I supported
[01:18:57.880 --> 01:19:03.400]  the Secretary of Defense to allow himself and allow general density to accept
[01:19:03.400 --> 01:19:07.960]  this notion that we had a soldier in need he was not a soldier the minute you
[01:19:07.960 --> 01:19:13.120]  walk off the base you are the deserter that is a criminal offense that there's
[01:19:13.120 --> 01:19:17.840]  no if and and buts about it his mental health is a problem that's an issue with
[01:19:17.840 --> 01:19:22.920]  all my hostages but we deal with it but we never go in on an issue of a
[01:19:22.920 --> 01:19:28.240]  deserter or a person who went AWOL so this is not a soldier we left behind me
[01:19:28.240 --> 01:19:31.800]  okay let me stop right there we're gonna skip this enemy we're gonna skip this
[01:19:31.800 --> 01:19:35.600]  network break let's just skip the network break I want to bring Leanne
[01:19:35.600 --> 01:19:39.000]  McAdoo in who's been holding patiently in the wings she was hopping up and down
[01:19:39.000 --> 01:19:42.080]  Saturday about this I wasn't really paying attention to it I'm glad she
[01:19:42.080 --> 01:19:46.160]  raised it to my attention and that Biggs did as well Leanne what are your
[01:19:46.160 --> 01:19:51.360]  questions or comments for Dr. Pachennick well I just it kind of seems like
[01:19:51.360 --> 01:19:55.400]  they're turning against Obama almost setting him up for impeachment at this
[01:19:55.400 --> 01:20:00.000]  point like they're they're done using him to create chaos as he's done a very
[01:20:00.000 --> 01:20:04.840]  good job of creating chaos but now it's I mean they immediately less than 24
[01:20:04.840 --> 01:20:07.960]  hours you know threw him under the bus so it's almost like they're setting him
[01:20:07.960 --> 01:20:13.800]  up for something but what I'm curious about is why these particular terrorists
[01:20:13.800 --> 01:20:17.560]  were released from Gitmo because they're part of a different network now
[01:20:17.560 --> 01:20:20.440]  obviously we need to do a little bit more research that will have this for the
[01:20:20.440 --> 01:20:24.280]  nightly news but there were other Taliban leaders that were part of the
[01:20:24.280 --> 01:20:28.360]  network that was holding Bergdahl that they could have negotiated for so why
[01:20:28.360 --> 01:20:32.320]  these why these particular guys and yeah we need to look at those people
[01:20:32.320 --> 01:20:37.360]  closely you know working to negotiate for these guys there's dad does not like
[01:20:37.360 --> 01:20:40.600]  a postman that's all I'm saying dr. Pachennick well I think you asked a
[01:20:40.600 --> 01:20:44.480]  brilliant question first of all the people who really held as I understood
[01:20:44.480 --> 01:20:49.280]  Bergdahl were not part of the okay the group they were hot honey hot honey is
[01:20:49.280 --> 01:20:54.560]  a spin-off of the CIA and the Pakistani ISI and we ironically have been
[01:20:54.560 --> 01:20:58.080]  working with them or the US governments were working with hot honey for a long
[01:20:58.080 --> 01:21:02.480]  time so this administration had a very good idea of what was happening to
[01:21:02.480 --> 01:21:07.080]  Bergdahl for a long time but your point about releasing these terrorists who
[01:21:07.080 --> 01:21:12.000]  were not part of the hot honey there are real old line killers and very
[01:21:12.000 --> 01:21:15.520]  professional killers you've killed thousands of Shiites and when they go
[01:21:15.520 --> 01:21:20.160]  out again they will kill again there's no issue that you to release a terrorist
[01:21:20.160 --> 01:21:24.800]  and you get a promise from the tar that they will be fine the tar is a place
[01:21:24.800 --> 01:21:29.160]  where you know you can buy and sell anything it's like Kazablanca well let me
[01:21:29.160 --> 01:21:32.560]  raise this to dr. Pachennick but in the tar though that's just that's the spot
[01:21:32.560 --> 01:21:35.800]  where they send soldiers for mid to relieve you know so you're gonna have
[01:21:35.800 --> 01:21:39.560]  soldiers in Qatar and you're gonna have these five terrorists who hate America
[01:21:39.560 --> 01:21:43.040]  running around out there having a field day correct and then how can we
[01:21:43.040 --> 01:21:46.680]  guarantee that this government can even you know keep dibs on these guys I mean
[01:21:46.680 --> 01:21:49.640]  let me throw this out let me throw this out well they may have been turned or
[01:21:49.640 --> 01:21:52.840]  something but the point is we don't know that or we get Pachennick's take on it
[01:21:52.840 --> 01:21:59.080]  here's my issue we're seeing a public reset with Libya Syria and all these
[01:21:59.080 --> 01:22:04.400]  other proxy wars to try to put al-Qaeda and jihadis out of Saudi Arabia in
[01:22:04.400 --> 01:22:08.840]  charge all over the Middle East to destabilize things further overthrow more
[01:22:08.840 --> 01:22:13.600]  stable governments I know Pachennick was actually arrested by Assad's dad so he's
[01:22:13.600 --> 01:22:17.880]  not a big fan of him but I want to get his take on this this is looks like a
[01:22:17.880 --> 01:22:23.440]  public reset to me with al-Qaeda affiliated groups understand the Akhani
[01:22:23.440 --> 01:22:27.360]  group goes back to 79 as a big presence key and the administration you were
[01:22:27.360 --> 01:22:31.800]  first in but expand on that daughter Pachennick does this feed into the reset
[01:22:31.800 --> 01:22:36.840]  I see happening with al-Qaeda well what's happening is al-Qaeda is becoming
[01:22:36.840 --> 01:22:40.200]  stronger and stronger and Obama can't admit that and that was the issue with
[01:22:40.200 --> 01:22:43.880]  Benghazi what happened in Benghazi was that we didn't have really an embassy
[01:22:43.880 --> 01:22:48.120]  then we had a house where we were interrogating the terrorists and
[01:22:48.120 --> 01:22:52.920]  basically shipping guns into Syria which is what we're doing again we have no
[01:22:52.920 --> 01:22:58.440]  policy and I think what the person said correctly is we're not imploding the
[01:22:58.440 --> 01:23:02.760]  president the president is imploding itself he has no control of what's going
[01:23:02.760 --> 01:23:07.600]  on CIA has no real intelligence they're shipping guns into the system and they
[01:23:07.600 --> 01:23:14.240]  are increasing the volatility of the area by really incompetency and what's
[01:23:14.240 --> 01:23:18.800]  happening now is we have to probably go in at some point in order to control it
[01:23:18.800 --> 01:23:23.680]  but right now we have CIA operatives in Jordan who are determining which which
[01:23:23.680 --> 01:23:27.360]  terrorists can go in there and who are moderate which is absolutely absurd
[01:23:27.360 --> 01:23:30.600]  once you are a terrorist you're terrorist there is no such thing as a
[01:23:30.600 --> 01:23:34.200]  moderate or extreme terrorist if you're willing to use violence you're willing
[01:23:34.200 --> 01:23:37.840]  to use violence what you're seeing now is the absence of intelligence
[01:23:37.840 --> 01:23:42.600]  competency and a historical sense of what's happened to our country and a
[01:23:42.600 --> 01:23:46.840]  future sense of where we should be going if it's as simple as that we have an
[01:23:46.840 --> 01:23:50.880]  incompetent president and incompetent secretary of state and incompetent
[01:23:50.880 --> 01:23:54.800]  secretary of defense well I mean they're clearly going the order out of chaos
[01:23:54.800 --> 01:23:59.480]  model but there's not even order they're taking out of the chaos and that's what
[01:23:59.480 --> 01:24:02.600]  I guess the British intelligence had said a few months ago was that they've
[01:24:02.600 --> 01:24:07.320]  never seen such disjointed lack of a message and I think it's because the
[01:24:07.320 --> 01:24:11.000]  military industrial complex interest and the big banks that only they just want
[01:24:11.000 --> 01:24:14.600]  more conflict so I guess in the final equation they do know what they're doing
[01:24:14.600 --> 01:24:18.680]  dr. Pachennick not really what's happening is even though the military
[01:24:18.680 --> 01:24:22.360]  industrial complex exists what's really happening is we're getting a
[01:24:22.360 --> 01:24:27.160]  escalation of chaos and we're getting what we're not looking at quite frankly
[01:24:27.160 --> 01:24:31.080]  my friend is in China and China is becoming a more and more of a
[01:24:31.080 --> 01:24:36.160]  aggravation on our Asian front and they can they're engaging themselves with
[01:24:36.160 --> 01:24:40.900]  Vietnam the Philippines and let me ask you that dr. Pachennick because you
[01:24:40.900 --> 01:24:43.800]  raise it I know you've been to North Korea you name it and worked with the
[01:24:43.800 --> 01:24:47.560]  South Korean government works the Japanese government expanding on that
[01:24:47.560 --> 01:24:51.040]  you reported last year live for us there you were a few years ago on you know
[01:24:51.040 --> 01:24:54.280]  saying watch China watch China I kind of halfway rolled my eyes because they're
[01:24:54.280 --> 01:24:57.640]  already taking us over economically why on earth would they want to mess with
[01:24:57.640 --> 01:25:01.960]  Japan now they're saying we'll take islands of Japan we'll take islands of
[01:25:01.960 --> 01:25:06.480]  the Philippines they're now threatening to basically invade Vietnam I mean what
[01:25:06.480 --> 01:25:10.320]  what's going on in China that's got them this aggressive when historically they've
[01:25:10.320 --> 01:25:14.480]  not acted like this China has always watched our leaders when they worked
[01:25:14.480 --> 01:25:18.200]  with Nixon it was very much afraid of them when they had to deal with Bush
[01:25:18.200 --> 01:25:22.200]  senior they were very much afraid of them when we have a strong leader they
[01:25:22.200 --> 01:25:26.360]  pulled back when you have a weak leader you have people like Putin who will
[01:25:26.360 --> 01:25:31.600]  annex Crimea and you will have the Chinese leadership say okay now we will
[01:25:31.600 --> 01:25:35.480]  go into the Spratly Islands the reason they're going into that area where we
[01:25:35.480 --> 01:25:40.600]  we have a national interest or a world strategic interest is because it's oil
[01:25:40.600 --> 01:25:45.680]  it's oil and gas which Vietnam the Philippines and Indonesia Taiwan claim
[01:25:45.680 --> 01:25:49.720]  it's been a claim for 20 years but now that they see we have an incompetent
[01:25:49.720 --> 01:25:54.560]  president who should really resign or being teach they will move forward
[01:25:54.560 --> 01:25:58.680]  because they know nothing can happen and sink back and not do very much about it
[01:25:58.680 --> 01:26:02.880]  at this point all they can act is as negotiated yeah for those that don't know
[01:26:02.880 --> 01:26:07.800]  the Chinese have been with arms taking over oil rigs and stuff already so
[01:26:07.800 --> 01:26:12.360]  correct I mean I mean this is really escalating fast correct and at the same
[01:26:12.360 --> 01:26:16.360]  time we're we're incredibly we're incredibly escalating into a chaotic
[01:26:16.360 --> 01:26:20.280]  state in the Middle East in short we have a president who doesn't belong there
[01:26:20.280 --> 01:26:24.480]  who has no idea what he's doing we have a national security advisor who has
[01:26:24.480 --> 01:26:29.880]  already failed in Libya lied to the public in Benghazi and it's really not
[01:26:29.880 --> 01:26:33.560]  a qualified to make any statements we have a Secretary of State who's totally
[01:26:33.560 --> 01:26:37.760]  incompetent talk well here's my final question and opportunity to global
[01:26:37.760 --> 01:26:42.080]  warming and has no idea what he's doing and we have a Hagle who's done absolutely
[01:26:42.080 --> 01:26:45.920]  nothing in short we do not have a government but we're paying a lot of
[01:26:45.920 --> 01:26:51.520]  money for incompetency Leanne McAdoo staff sergeant Joe Biggs final questions
[01:26:51.520 --> 01:26:58.360]  for Dr. Picinnaker final statements well I think you know for me personally I
[01:26:58.360 --> 01:27:02.800]  really I feel like they the globalists or they're done with Obama I mean I
[01:27:02.800 --> 01:27:09.640]  really feel like he has created so much chaos and now with just the media kind
[01:27:09.640 --> 01:27:12.880]  of turning on him and not just accepting the story this guy's a hero let's
[01:27:12.880 --> 01:27:17.880]  let's move on you know this is this is big and the fact that he did all of this
[01:27:17.880 --> 01:27:22.840]  without going through the proper you know 30-day you got a notify Congress you
[01:27:22.840 --> 01:27:27.680]  know change that in the NDAA when in December made that to where he can kind
[01:27:27.680 --> 01:27:32.280]  of fast track it so this whole thing is just it's just very fishy and I agree
[01:27:32.280 --> 01:27:35.800]  but don't think the networks behind Obama are gonna not give a power they
[01:27:35.800 --> 01:27:39.320]  could stage a false flag and try to try to use that to get their butt out of the
[01:27:39.320 --> 01:27:43.720]  fire Biggs any other comments because I want to get Picinnak's take on a false
[01:27:43.720 --> 01:27:47.560]  flag I'm just curious as to whether or not they're gonna somehow spend this to
[01:27:47.560 --> 01:27:51.560]  make him a hero or in fact are they going to actually punish him as a
[01:27:51.560 --> 01:27:56.520]  deserter like he should be they're gonna spend him as a hero but the irony
[01:27:56.520 --> 01:28:00.040]  which you just brought out an excellent point the more they make him a hero I
[01:28:00.040 --> 01:28:03.760]  can guarantee you from his own personal dynamics and I dealt with a lot of
[01:28:03.760 --> 01:28:08.560]  hostages who were not heroes not none of the homeboys of treasonous as his
[01:28:08.560 --> 01:28:13.480]  gentleman was he will commit suicide at some point there's no question about it
[01:28:13.480 --> 01:28:18.640]  because he knows very well he was treasonous he was AWOL and he consorted
[01:28:18.640 --> 01:28:22.800]  with the enemy I've never met a hostage who could not speak English after years
[01:28:22.800 --> 01:28:27.000]  that being incarcerated with their terrorists I've never seen that and
[01:28:27.000 --> 01:28:31.720]  what it means in fact is that he became one of them they never tortured him they
[01:28:31.720 --> 01:28:35.480]  never harmed them he knows that he admitted it they chop people's heads off
[01:28:35.480 --> 01:28:40.400]  all the time but he's left unscathed he's left unscathed and he did the first
[01:28:40.400 --> 01:28:46.240]  words that that are you know words of Arabic and then Pashtun and the
[01:28:46.240 --> 01:28:49.640]  inability to speak English tells me that he went completely to the other side
[01:28:49.640 --> 01:28:53.560]  willing and by the way his dad knows that because he said you need to you know
[01:28:53.560 --> 01:28:58.360]  like a diver coming up too quick you know you need you know you could end up
[01:28:58.360 --> 01:29:02.680]  dying so I guess the army doctors are telling him that dr. Pettenek well what's
[01:29:02.680 --> 01:29:07.320]  happening is his dad basically intimidated Obama and the administration
[01:29:07.320 --> 01:29:11.160]  because what happened is this man should never have been recruited into the
[01:29:11.160 --> 01:29:16.200]  army this was a very sweet boy he was an ex ballet dancer dancing in the nut
[01:29:16.200 --> 01:29:20.760]  cracker suite and he was a free spirit who grew up in a cabin lodge with no
[01:29:20.760 --> 01:29:25.160]  phones nothing else his father was kind of a hippie and that's all fine when he
[01:29:25.160 --> 01:29:28.960]  went to the recruiter the recruiter told him no we in the army are basically
[01:29:28.960 --> 01:29:33.880]  like the peace corps but we have gone give me a break and this guy ended up to
[01:29:33.880 --> 01:29:40.560]  be a machine gunner I mean this was the military is really totally embarrassed

[01:33:28.200 --> 01:33:32.520]  week but I want to make him a bigger part of the nightly news and also the
[01:33:32.520 --> 01:33:36.960]  whole operation and he's a John Rampaport best-selling author researcher
[01:33:36.960 --> 01:33:40.400]  political analyst investigative journalist and so many other hats he's
[01:33:40.400 --> 01:33:45.000]  coming up in just one moment to cover the waterfront of issues and I know that
[01:33:45.000 --> 01:33:51.800]  we have Sean and Wyoming worked with worked on issues concerning the question
[01:33:51.800 --> 01:33:56.080]  I had dealing with Bergdahl and we've got Brandon in Texas whose active army
[01:33:56.080 --> 01:34:01.160]  who's been holding as well so we'll we'll finish up with Bergdahl first with
[01:34:01.160 --> 01:34:05.160]  Rappaport and get his take on that he's always up on the news as a newshound let
[01:34:05.160 --> 01:34:08.920]  those callers they've been holding for 30 minutes get off the line Brandon and
[01:34:08.920 --> 01:34:13.800]  Sean and then move forward into all these other issues with the host of no
[01:34:13.800 --> 01:34:20.640]  more fake news.com John Rappaport before we go any further we are going to sell
[01:34:20.640 --> 01:34:25.920]  out of the super female vitality all it is is ten well-known herbs that are
[01:34:25.920 --> 01:34:32.080]  organic and concentrated in a live cold-pressed tincture form and that's
[01:34:32.080 --> 01:34:37.720]  why everyone I talked to I mean almost everyone I know one person it's not like
[01:34:37.720 --> 01:34:41.440]  ten women I know that have taken it one person said it made them tired at first
[01:34:41.440 --> 01:34:44.160]  and that's because they think they had a hormone imbalance or something so it
[01:34:44.160 --> 01:34:47.440]  can affect people differently have said it makes them bounce off the walls with
[01:34:47.440 --> 01:34:51.800]  energy libido you name it they had already at the laboratory run less than a
[01:34:51.800 --> 01:34:57.080]  thousand extra for our next order so we can get those so we're not back order
[01:34:57.080 --> 01:35:01.120]  those are coming in a few days but when those are gone it could be three weeks
[01:35:01.120 --> 01:35:05.120]  it could be a month and a half because we're waiting on two of the herbs that
[01:35:05.120 --> 01:35:10.680]  are raw to be cold-pressed and you got to get them certified organic and all the
[01:35:10.680 --> 01:35:13.840]  rest of it we're very neurotic about that is want to bring you the very best
[01:35:13.840 --> 01:35:18.640]  quality when it costs us 15 to $20 a bottle other people have similar stuff
[01:35:18.640 --> 01:35:22.240]  it's like $2 a bottle and they sell it for 100 instead of 50 like we do and this
[01:35:22.240 --> 01:35:25.680]  is how we find our operation bringing you the super male vitality which we have
[01:35:25.680 --> 01:35:32.600]  plenty of the super female vitality and the X2 iodine now again we came out a
[01:35:32.600 --> 01:35:37.320]  year ago with the first survival shield we still have that in stock and a
[01:35:37.320 --> 01:35:42.520]  discounted it and it's great it turns blue on paper all the other iodine's
[01:35:42.520 --> 01:35:46.760]  turned black and that's because we believe they're bound with the alcohol or
[01:35:46.760 --> 01:35:49.840]  something but you still need it still need iodine promise is not palatable for
[01:35:49.840 --> 01:35:55.320]  kids and things like that he came out with the X2 that is from deep iodine
[01:35:55.320 --> 01:35:59.560]  crystals that are purple and that's why it's important on paper folks it turns
[01:35:59.560 --> 01:36:03.280]  purple the other items don't turn purple you'll notice that's because this is real
[01:36:03.280 --> 01:36:07.160]  pure iodine and that's why Dr. Group believes it goes into the blood and just
[01:36:07.160 --> 01:36:11.680]  has this big effect because because it just goes right into you and now
[01:36:11.680 --> 01:36:16.360]  consult your physician before you take it and or your healthcare provider and
[01:36:16.360 --> 01:36:20.960]  I would I would go slow that's my advice you know this is all I mean even the
[01:36:20.960 --> 01:36:23.440]  government admits you need iodine they used to put it in the salt and they
[01:36:23.440 --> 01:36:26.880]  don't now and said they put stuff in the food chain that's the opposite of it the
[01:36:26.880 --> 01:36:31.800]  bromines and bromides that block iodine but but for me this has just been
[01:36:31.800 --> 01:36:35.680]  life-changing and we love to promote and sell things that are excellent that
[01:36:35.680 --> 01:36:39.840]  help fund the operation in the hardcore free speech we have so bare minimum try
[01:36:39.840 --> 01:36:43.080]  it out for yourself if you're talking to your healthcare provider and reading
[01:36:43.080 --> 01:36:46.400]  all the you know disclaimers and things I mean hell they can make you have
[01:36:46.400 --> 01:36:49.600]  disclaimers for vitamin C now folks so just whatever look into it for yourself

[01:38:06.960 --> 01:38:11.240]  world to an extent yet to where we can't get the funding so thank you if the
[01:38:11.240 --> 01:38:16.120]  funding continues to come in sometimes it's lean sometimes it's fat we take the
[01:38:16.120 --> 01:38:20.240]  fat we put it into the operation to get more reporters more people trained to do
[01:38:20.240 --> 01:38:25.160]  more and that's what we're doing now from Bilderberg to the FEMA camps in
[01:38:25.160 --> 01:38:30.200]  Virginia to the radiation on the West Coast to just reporters everywhere our
[01:38:30.200 --> 01:38:34.760]  great reporters like Jacarie Jackson Lee and Mancadoo Darren McBreen
[01:38:34.760 --> 01:38:39.960]  sergeant Staff Sergeant Joe Biggs you just all the great reporters all the
[01:38:39.960 --> 01:38:44.760]  like John bound there are so many others Paul Watson Steve Watson the curtain
[01:38:44.760 --> 01:38:49.320]  demo just all of them and the video editors and the whole team it's now over
[01:38:49.320 --> 01:38:53.880]  50 people total you have customer service shipping reporters writers crew
[01:38:53.880 --> 01:38:57.320]  running the shows everyone is just as important as everybody else because
[01:38:57.320 --> 01:39:01.640]  let's face it I'm the first person to not be a narcissist on a power trip I
[01:39:01.640 --> 01:39:04.600]  get very excited about the people we've reached and what we've been able to do
[01:39:04.600 --> 01:39:11.040]  with passion and the truth but different strokes for different folks I come off as
[01:39:11.040 --> 01:39:15.840]  obnoxious I come off as aggressive I come off as bombastic as interrupting it on
[01:39:15.840 --> 01:39:20.720]  many fronts some people don't like me but they'll like our other reporters
[01:39:20.720 --> 01:39:25.840]  they'll like Lee and Maca do they'll like a Rob do and and their perspective on
[01:39:25.840 --> 01:39:30.320]  the world and our yardstick is do you love liberty do you want the truth do
[01:39:30.320 --> 01:39:33.640]  you care about history do you care about freedom that's the kind of reporters we
[01:39:33.640 --> 01:39:36.480]  want some of them have journalism degrees from the University of Texas like
[01:39:36.480 --> 01:39:41.800]  Lee and others have worked for you know McClatchy and Scripps Howard like McBreen
[01:39:41.800 --> 01:39:47.520]  others have worked for you know production for semiconductor companies
[01:39:47.520 --> 01:39:52.440]  like Rob do others have no formal training like yours truly we all just
[01:39:52.440 --> 01:39:56.320]  bring truth and justice to the table and we're very excited to have the whole
[01:39:56.320 --> 01:39:59.480]  team here I want to take some time out to thank all of you for supporting the
[01:39:59.480 --> 01:40:03.720]  operation so we could build this one-of-a-kind operation I want to thank
[01:40:03.720 --> 01:40:08.280]  God number one for the providence of taking a sinner and a weak creature like
[01:40:08.280 --> 01:40:12.800]  myself and the fact that I just turned my will over to liberty and was given
[01:40:12.800 --> 01:40:17.080]  something even greater than free will I still have free will but it's free will
[01:40:17.080 --> 01:40:22.120]  with a drive towards justice and so I am so humble and I'm living the American
[01:40:22.120 --> 01:40:25.680]  dream of liberty there's great evil happening but that's what animates us
[01:40:25.680 --> 01:40:30.480]  that's the opposing force that test our metal and so I am humble before my
[01:40:30.480 --> 01:40:34.680]  creator and humble before other great lovers of liberty like John Rappaport
[01:40:34.680 --> 01:40:38.320]  and so many others that we have on this broadcast John I want to go to a few
[01:40:38.320 --> 01:40:41.880]  calls from Brandon and Shawn and then give you the floor to the fact I may
[01:40:41.880 --> 01:40:45.400]  even let you just take over the last 30 minutes to really get into whatever you
[01:40:45.400 --> 01:40:49.120]  want and may just step away not even because of time while the horses couldn't
[01:40:49.120 --> 01:40:52.760]  drag me away but I'm getting you primed to maybe send you some better
[01:40:52.760 --> 01:40:58.000]  equipment and have you host the show sometimes just like the great David
[01:40:58.000 --> 01:41:01.220]  Knight does who's out of the country with Josh Owens coming back from
[01:41:01.220 --> 01:41:06.720]  Bilderberg today in Copenhagen but give us your brief take on let me not too
[01:41:06.720 --> 01:41:10.880]  brief on the Bo Bergdahl story why it doesn't it doesn't smell good to me I
[01:41:10.880 --> 01:41:13.960]  want to see if it doesn't smell good to you and then we're gonna go to Brandon
[01:41:13.960 --> 01:41:19.280]  and Shawn and then move on to other issues thanks Alex absolutely well I
[01:41:19.280 --> 01:41:24.480]  would say three things quickly one is an operation like this to bring back this
[01:41:24.480 --> 01:41:32.840]  guy is aimed at demoralizing US soldiers the entire you know rank and file
[01:41:32.840 --> 01:41:38.800]  that's number one that's exactly how do you give focus to a trader and someone
[01:41:38.800 --> 01:41:42.560]  who went and joined other people and then hold that up it's meant to make us all
[01:41:42.560 --> 01:41:46.440]  feel bad see I hadn't gone with that angle you you hit it go ahead expand on
[01:41:46.440 --> 01:41:52.680]  that right I mean that's the idea the guy is a wall he deserts whatever and all
[01:41:52.680 --> 01:41:59.160]  of a sudden this tremendous deal is made to return these Taliban chiefs in
[01:41:59.160 --> 01:42:03.320]  return you know for this guy and so what does soldier start thinking well what
[01:42:03.320 --> 01:42:07.800]  are we doing over here in Afghanistan you know we're we're dying we're getting
[01:42:07.800 --> 01:42:14.360]  wounded we're serving multiple tours to capture and kill these Taliban people and
[01:42:14.360 --> 01:42:20.160]  all of a sudden a few of the major ones are free and this guy who walked away
[01:42:20.160 --> 01:42:26.520]  US soldier he's returned to the United States so that immediately puts a total
[01:42:26.520 --> 01:42:34.280]  cold blanket on the whole rank and file of the US Army and then number two of
[01:42:34.280 --> 01:42:41.960]  course it distracts everybody from the enormous VA scandal the enormous and
[01:42:41.960 --> 01:42:46.720]  growing VA scandal that we haven't even begun to scratch the surface on believe
[01:42:46.720 --> 01:42:52.280]  me I mean as huge as the implications are so far that's nothing to compare to
[01:42:52.280 --> 01:42:56.320]  what's going to be dug up on this by people that are really looking so this
[01:42:56.320 --> 01:43:00.520]  proof you know glosses all of that over oh the commander in chief did a great
[01:43:00.520 --> 01:43:04.800]  thing and this and that and it's promoted by all the talking points from the
[01:43:04.800 --> 01:43:09.640]  White House on the Sunday talk shows etc and then the final and third thing that
[01:43:09.640 --> 01:43:15.600]  I would say and yes this is speculation but who knows maybe this guy this US
[01:43:15.600 --> 01:43:21.040]  soldier that was just returned suppose for example he was actually getting
[01:43:21.040 --> 01:43:25.640]  ready to talk in public not because somebody had brainwashed him who knows
[01:43:25.640 --> 01:43:30.520]  I don't know what this guy actually is but just suppose that he wants to go
[01:43:30.520 --> 01:43:35.160]  public and talk about what's happened in the war over there and the US
[01:43:35.160 --> 01:43:40.280]  intelligence community got wind of it wouldn't that be and they say to the
[01:43:40.280 --> 01:43:44.440]  and they say to the economy network you grab him you give him back we'll give you
[01:43:44.440 --> 01:43:48.680]  who you want now they have him locked down in the hospital exactly and never
[01:43:48.680 --> 01:43:56.120]  to be seen again boom and a story could very well be I think we've had all the
[01:43:56.120 --> 01:43:59.040]  angles I think we've had all the angles on that let's take a call from Brandon
[01:43:59.040 --> 01:44:03.360]  and then Sean Brandon is active army thank you for holding Brandon what's
[01:44:03.360 --> 01:44:08.040]  your take on this whole thing yeah I think we need to go back to the the
[01:44:08.040 --> 01:44:12.320]  difference in stories between whether or not this guy walked off the fob or
[01:44:12.320 --> 01:44:18.080]  whether or not he fell behind on a patrol if he walked off that Bob the
[01:44:18.080 --> 01:44:23.240]  soldiers around him would have say he just dropped all his gear in his weapon
[01:44:23.240 --> 01:44:27.920]  his platoon sergeant would have had to check that back in his TA 50 and his
[01:44:27.920 --> 01:44:34.360]  weapon now I think that we have to look at that first I mean there's a paper
[01:44:34.360 --> 01:44:37.840]  trail there there's always a paper trail whenever you're saying the hobbits the
[01:44:37.840 --> 01:44:43.520]  hobbits at the base as they're called would have actually checked all that and
[01:44:43.520 --> 01:44:47.360]  had a record well that's what CNN is saying is that oh my gosh you know people
[01:44:47.360 --> 01:44:54.240]  at the base are saying he walked off but but there'd be proof right so another
[01:44:54.240 --> 01:44:58.160]  thing I don't see how he could have possibly fell behind on a patrol any
[01:44:58.160 --> 01:45:03.200]  squad leader worth of salt's never gonna let anybody outside I mean accountability
[01:45:03.200 --> 01:45:09.640]  is a huge thing in the military I'm just not buying it I think it's more likely
[01:45:09.640 --> 01:45:13.480]  will continue I was interrupting you going back going back to the going back
[01:45:13.480 --> 01:45:21.960]  to this forward base and describing how security works on those well there's um
[01:45:21.960 --> 01:45:27.400]  the only way he could have walked off that Bob was if he was on an ECP which is
[01:45:27.400 --> 01:45:33.840]  entry control point there would have been several people seen him do it yeah
[01:45:33.840 --> 01:45:39.120]  they could have been told to lie or whatever about it but most time they
[01:45:39.120 --> 01:45:43.600]  don't cover all their bases there's gonna be a paper trail and if he was if he
[01:45:43.600 --> 01:45:47.320]  fell behind on a patrol and got picked up out in the middle of nowhere then his
[01:45:47.320 --> 01:45:52.000]  weapon and TA 50 would be missing which TA 50 is what you know your gear you carry
[01:45:52.000 --> 01:45:59.360]  so that's I'm hearing two different stories on that and I think if we get
[01:45:59.360 --> 01:46:03.640]  to the bottom of that we'll find out a lot more about what this guy really is
[01:46:03.640 --> 01:46:10.560]  personally I think he was a traitor to begin with one or other people around
[01:46:10.560 --> 01:46:15.880]  you think same thing that's the conclusion that we've pretty much all
[01:46:15.880 --> 01:46:23.320]  come to I don't know anybody that knows him personally but it it's just not it's
[01:46:23.320 --> 01:46:28.640]  not passing the smell test with any of us why would Obama then do this and
[01:46:28.640 --> 01:46:33.520]  release five of these really bad guys and then you know at the same time build
[01:46:33.520 --> 01:46:37.080]  a scop like a hero I mean it just I mean didn't Obama know that'll blow up in his
[01:46:37.080 --> 01:46:40.960]  face he just doesn't care I don't think he cares I think he's just helping his
[01:46:40.960 --> 01:46:49.480]  buddies out that's it bottom line very interesting I appreciate your call
[01:46:49.480 --> 01:46:53.920]  let's talk to Sean in Wyoming Sean go ahead you're on the air thank you Alex
[01:46:53.920 --> 01:46:57.040]  haven't talked to you in a while I'm the fellow who worked with the Reagan
[01:46:57.040 --> 01:47:00.200]  National Advanced Team for the campaign and 80 with the Secret Service and so
[01:47:00.200 --> 01:47:04.000]  forth and and I've been up here in Wyoming for 36 years and I want to throw
[01:47:04.000 --> 01:47:09.520]  some more food for thought I think you basically we've got all the pieces of
[01:47:09.520 --> 01:47:15.840]  there's been some tremendous points and they all have validity but what I you
[01:47:15.840 --> 01:47:21.160]  know I've been up in Wyoming for 36 years and I know the people and the
[01:47:21.160 --> 01:47:24.820]  different political factions in Montana Wyoming and Idaho like the back of my
[01:47:24.820 --> 01:47:30.680]  hand and what struck me most telling is the fact when they wheeled these folks
[01:47:30.680 --> 01:47:34.560]  out with Obama the other day and then when they flew back into Boise and they
[01:47:34.560 --> 01:47:39.280]  had that press conference there's all kinds of different factions in Idaho as
[01:47:39.280 --> 01:47:43.400]  you might know there's a constitutionalist and white supremacist and
[01:47:43.400 --> 01:47:47.960]  Nazis and former government people and it's a whole plethora it's unlike
[01:47:47.960 --> 01:47:53.720]  anything in Montana or Wyoming and you what you have here is basically by the
[01:47:53.720 --> 01:47:58.120]  way of the appearance of the boy's father a nonconformist and he can be a
[01:47:58.120 --> 01:48:02.760]  nonconformist on the left or right he certainly to me came across as a little
[01:48:02.760 --> 01:48:07.360]  bit in the hippie hippie deal and they're they're naturalists if you look at
[01:48:07.360 --> 01:48:12.400]  her so you're saying he was kind of an odd duck a hippie odd duck well he he
[01:48:12.400 --> 01:48:16.760]  was he was typical of anybody who knows the social climate of Idaho central
[01:48:16.760 --> 01:48:21.560]  Idaho and northern Idaho where all these different people gather and this very
[01:48:21.560 --> 01:48:25.720]  guy you know he could be pachettic may have something this guy may have walked
[01:48:25.720 --> 01:48:29.480]  away he might have been another Brad Tillman he went over there and I had
[01:48:29.480 --> 01:48:34.440]  some moral objections on what we were doing walked over to the other side and
[01:48:34.440 --> 01:48:40.960]  and that's and and he had come from a you know from a family that let's say
[01:48:40.960 --> 01:48:45.920]  we're we're progressives and the thought outside the box and them and that's the
[01:48:45.920 --> 01:48:50.560]  old man was trying to communicate with him the other day how how proud he was
[01:48:50.560 --> 01:48:55.800]  that he did he he held to his moral convictions but it's it it doesn't
[01:48:55.800 --> 01:49:00.360]  smell right it's just part of a continual psi up whether it's in the
[01:49:00.360 --> 01:49:06.000]  Santa Barbara or a new town or this deal and it's obviously the first thing that
[01:49:06.000 --> 01:49:10.680]  hit me was the fact that it's a major distraction from the VA we've got our
[01:49:10.680 --> 01:49:18.200]  own problems here in Wyoming down at the base in Cheyenne a fort warring and
[01:49:18.200 --> 01:49:23.920]  and the and then the fact that they came from Idaho and you know there's it's
[01:49:23.920 --> 01:49:28.320]  just very interesting and it will it's just another psi up as far as I'm
[01:49:28.320 --> 01:49:32.000]  concerned on a very interesting point we're gonna take one more call after
[01:49:32.000 --> 01:49:36.000]  break and then or right now they come back from break with John Rappaport of
[01:49:36.000 --> 01:49:41.400]  no more fake news.com was riding shotgun with me here today but Pat Tillman
[01:49:41.400 --> 01:49:44.720]  didn't like them growing opium and guarding it and didn't like the fact
[01:49:44.720 --> 01:49:47.760]  they were doing photo ops and we're working with some of the al-Qaeda
[01:49:47.760 --> 01:49:52.320]  Taliban but not the others and now that's come out so I don't want to put
[01:49:52.320 --> 01:49:57.280]  him in the same area as this guy Pat Tillman was an amazing guy making five
[01:49:57.280 --> 01:50:00.120]  million dollars a year turned it all loose because he thought America was
[01:50:00.120 --> 01:50:03.680]  under attack and then he went over there and found it was a bigger fraud and got
[01:50:03.680 --> 01:50:10.240]  upset totally different person than this guy let's talk to Max in Idaho real
[01:50:10.240 --> 01:50:13.880]  quick says mother-in-law his friends with family knows parents max what's your
[01:50:13.880 --> 01:50:20.160]  take on all this briefly this is a max this is his mother-in-law okay just

[01:50:33.320 --> 01:50:42.960]  believe that both father through a beard and began to speak Arabic right after
[01:50:42.960 --> 01:50:47.880]  Bo was captured because he I think there was nothing more than just he wanted to
[01:50:47.880 --> 01:50:51.040]  so it was doing it through solidarity stay there ma'am don't hang up well what's

[01:54:22.800 --> 01:54:38.600]  by the way I haven't gotten to any of the aftermath of Bilderberg 2014 a lot of
[01:54:38.600 --> 01:54:42.320]  important Intel I was on coast to coast to him last night breaking some of that
[01:54:42.320 --> 01:54:46.320]  down John Rappaport I said what do you want to get into today some wild card
[01:54:46.320 --> 01:54:50.800]  issue he goes free energy or other old forms of alternative energy that are
[01:54:50.800 --> 01:54:55.880]  being suppressed while they prepare to cut off our old forms of energy and he's
[01:54:55.880 --> 01:55:00.080]  really got a lot of intel on that we're just a lot of the next hour on that
[01:55:00.080 --> 01:55:04.080]  subject if you go up to drudgereport.com it's now scroll down to the bottom
[01:55:04.080 --> 01:55:09.480]  right hand side you can find an article that we put out last night and it says
[01:55:09.480 --> 01:55:17.080]  in the US four major news networks zero Bilderberg 2014 coverage only some CNBC
[01:55:17.080 --> 01:55:22.800]  coverage drudge covered it info wars covered it world net daily covered it a
[01:55:22.800 --> 01:55:29.560]  whole bunch of European newspapers covered it but no news in the US other
[01:55:29.560 --> 01:55:33.040]  than one cable network and that's because people want to know about business so
[01:55:33.040 --> 01:55:40.320]  it was business news and it's just incredible that not even Fox News would
[01:55:40.320 --> 01:55:47.640]  cover this last year the Napolitano did cover when he was filling in on one of
[01:55:47.640 --> 01:55:54.960]  the shows on Fox business so again that's why they're becoming obsolete it's
[01:55:54.960 --> 01:55:57.920]  because they won't talk about world leaders meeting in secret when the
[01:55:57.920 --> 01:56:01.320]  world leaders brag in their own minutes and told German news that they're more
[01:56:01.320 --> 01:56:06.160]  powerful than Davos so I'm going to get Rappaport's take on that John Rappaport
[01:56:06.160 --> 01:56:10.920]  coming up right shotgun with us briefly here going back to Susan so she knows
[01:56:10.920 --> 01:56:15.720]  the family any other points you'd like to make on this whole situation with the
[01:56:15.720 --> 01:56:21.600]  so-called you know prisoner of war release Bo Bergdahl go ahead well I
[01:56:21.600 --> 01:56:25.720]  take on on it I've known the kids since he was a little boy I've known Bob and
[01:56:25.720 --> 01:56:31.960]  Jamie forever my daughter went to school with Bo he was just nothing more than
[01:56:31.960 --> 01:56:37.880]  then I think that he just wandered off because I think he got over there and
[01:56:37.880 --> 01:56:41.840]  he was scared he didn't want to be there I think it was I think it's very
[01:56:41.840 --> 01:56:48.800]  innocent he I think he was brainwashed as far as I'm concerned because if you
[01:56:48.800 --> 01:56:53.320]  knew the valley that that we were all raised in it's very simple valley and
[01:56:53.320 --> 01:56:57.840]  there's nothing to be scared of to be raised there you're just raised and the
[01:56:57.840 --> 01:57:04.720]  boys either go off to service or they go to college and Bo decided to go to the
[01:57:04.720 --> 01:57:09.200]  service and he got caught up in expecting that he wasn't prepared for
[01:57:09.200 --> 01:57:14.440]  and I think it's nothing more or nothing less than that ma'am I'd like to put you

[02:00:36.160 --> 02:00:40.000]  country that's what targets the main line public that doesn't know their hands
[02:00:40.000 --> 02:00:44.480]  from their butt in many cases because of the upbringing of the media brainwashing
[02:00:44.480 --> 02:00:49.560]  system we've got John Rappaport on the line with this investigative journalist
[02:00:49.560 --> 02:00:53.920]  no more fake news this is a short segment bunch of long segments coming up and I
[02:00:53.920 --> 02:00:57.280]  want him to really be able to get into the conspiracy to shut off our old
[02:00:57.280 --> 02:01:01.040]  industry while blocking new energy while acting like they're for the new energy
[02:01:01.040 --> 02:01:04.960]  so I'm going to give him the floor from 24 after to the end that's about 30
[02:01:04.960 --> 02:01:08.880]  minutes of airtime with John Rappaport I don't even have to go anywhere I just
[02:01:08.880 --> 02:01:12.000]  want to turn the show over to him and listen so that's coming up with John
[02:01:12.000 --> 02:01:16.880]  Rappaport today and I'll be back tomorrow with the show with Paul Watson

[02:01:20.480 --> 02:01:24.920]  week but you were getting into the real reality of Afghanistan I've got my
[02:01:24.920 --> 02:01:28.520]  breakdown reality of what it's really like just a big hole to dump money into
[02:01:28.520 --> 02:01:34.280]  a full spectrum dominance globalist system break down your take on Afghanistan
[02:01:34.280 --> 02:01:37.760]  we'll go to break come back mention Bilderberg a few other issues and then
[02:01:37.760 --> 02:01:42.800]  get into free energy no question about it it's as you say a full spectrum
[02:01:42.800 --> 02:01:49.280]  dominance operation it's also drugs it's also you know a rise in the poppies
[02:01:49.280 --> 02:01:56.440]  lots more poppies growing since we went over there the opium is flowing the
[02:01:56.440 --> 02:02:01.880]  opium has to be kept flowing there's a long-standing project to build an oil
[02:02:01.880 --> 02:02:07.600]  pipeline through there there's all kinds of military geopolitical economic
[02:02:07.600 --> 02:02:11.680]  reasons what we're over there and then of course you've got the rules of
[02:02:11.680 --> 02:02:16.120]  engagement which would drive anybody crazy you know do you have to call back
[02:02:16.120 --> 02:02:19.440]  to get permission to kill somebody in case you don't know who they are and
[02:02:19.440 --> 02:02:22.800]  they might have a gun and they're ready to kill you and you're gonna do two or
[02:02:22.800 --> 02:02:28.880]  three tours like this I mean the whole idea that yes we're over there we're an
[02:02:28.880 --> 02:02:32.960]  army we're not just an intelligence group or an army we're killing people this
[02:02:32.960 --> 02:02:37.480]  is a war but we can only kill certain people a certain amount of the time and
[02:02:37.480 --> 02:02:41.400]  we're helping other people build villages and so forth all at the same time
[02:02:41.400 --> 02:02:46.020]  this is not what an army does this is not the way an army can operate this
[02:02:46.020 --> 02:02:50.120]  creates crazy people people want to walk away people who want to kill
[02:02:50.120 --> 02:02:55.320]  themselves and then you put them on all kinds of psychiatric drugs which they
[02:02:55.320 --> 02:03:00.080]  use to self-medicate themselves over there that cause suicide like the SSRI
[02:03:00.080 --> 02:03:05.720]  anti-depressants and you've got a complete catastrophe as witnessed by
[02:03:05.720 --> 02:03:11.720]  what's happening at the VA now so I go back to saying this is a major distraction
[02:03:11.720 --> 02:03:21.160]  this whole prisoner exchange thing to cover up the deep corruption at the VA
[02:03:21.160 --> 02:03:25.280]  well I agree with you man I tell you I mean I know they built Obama up as a
[02:03:25.280 --> 02:03:28.800]  savior and he's meant to be politically destroyed by the end so a new
[02:03:28.800 --> 02:03:33.680]  savior can come in but he is rotting on the vine really fast right now I mean
[02:03:33.680 --> 02:03:37.840]  can they leave him in another two years or or or will he end up getting impeached
[02:03:37.840 --> 02:03:42.560]  or something I don't see any way he can be impeached he's there till the end and
[02:03:42.560 --> 02:03:47.640]  then they're all the media are all gonna try to celebrate his presidency and do
[02:03:47.640 --> 02:03:53.600]  all sorts of you know retrospectives you can count on you know endosomal Exactly
[02:03:53.600 --> 02:03:56.960]  they'll tear him down let him fall on the sword then they'll build him back up
[02:03:56.960 --> 02:04:01.680]  later sure just like they did to Clinton and you even see it a little bit with
[02:04:01.680 --> 02:04:07.240]  Bush they always do the same thing and and Obama is going to take place in the
[02:04:07.240 --> 02:04:13.680]  pantheon of great presidents eventually by revisionist history but that finally
[02:04:13.680 --> 02:04:18.080]  comes to an end I mean the cynicism that the nine percent of people rating is
[02:04:18.080 --> 02:04:22.280]  lowest six for Congress I mean this is not the same old cycle anymore I don't
[02:04:22.280 --> 02:04:24.880]  see him getting away with it I want to talk about that with you when we get
[02:04:24.880 --> 02:04:28.920]  back and something we talked about on the Sunday show that's what I wanted to
[02:04:28.920 --> 02:04:32.680]  get you back today because we ran out of time let's spend some time on positive
[02:04:32.680 --> 02:04:37.720]  stuff first what it is to be free where the world's going how we can change

[02:10:08.600 --> 02:10:12.680]  about energy or I don't work for it energies your number one cost and then
[02:10:12.680 --> 02:10:15.880]  this is where they're really gaming us you want to conquer somebody control the
[02:10:15.880 --> 02:10:21.280]  energy so we're gonna from the calories our kids eat to the oil in our cars to
[02:10:21.280 --> 02:10:24.480]  the coal powered plants to the solar farms to the wind farms there it's all
[02:10:24.480 --> 02:10:29.200]  game folks the globalist or scientific in their takeover read eco science they
[02:10:29.200 --> 02:10:34.360]  break down the control of energy at every level but we saw them black out the
[02:10:34.360 --> 02:10:37.920]  windows at Bilderberg and put up fences and go to the greatest links ever in
[02:10:37.920 --> 02:10:44.560]  Copenhagen Denmark to block the public in the press this year but then on like
[02:10:44.560 --> 02:10:48.440]  the sixth floor men all come up in robes all holding on to each other acting
[02:10:48.440 --> 02:10:52.880]  weird and have some pretty boy come and wave at everybody and flaunt it at the
[02:10:52.880 --> 02:10:56.960]  media and general portray us will come to the window and stare at people and
[02:10:56.960 --> 02:11:01.400]  others and it was really act weird and I guess they're really mad it's being
[02:11:01.400 --> 02:11:05.040]  exposed they can't deny there's a shadow global government this is really
[02:11:05.040 --> 02:11:08.920]  coming out we're showing some video of that for TV viewers right now radio
[02:11:08.920 --> 02:11:14.040]  listeners and go to info wars calm and see the videos in HD but what do you
[02:11:14.040 --> 02:11:17.880]  think's really behind all this black the windows out that have multiple
[02:11:17.880 --> 02:11:21.240]  Bilderberg group members come out and talk to the press in the public saying
[02:11:21.240 --> 02:11:24.880]  we're no big deal that have ever have other Bilderberg members tell the
[02:11:24.880 --> 02:11:29.920]  German press we actually you know pretty much run things and the leader of the
[02:11:29.920 --> 02:11:33.240]  Dutch parliament say I don't violate the law being here to discuss government
[02:11:33.240 --> 02:11:37.480]  policy because we're public we'll know you're not public so are they scared of
[02:11:37.480 --> 02:11:40.880]  indictment there's talk of that in England why are they blocking out
[02:11:40.880 --> 02:11:45.000]  windows but leaving one open and having men old men parade around with a pretty
[02:11:45.000 --> 02:11:51.360]  boy you know scantily clothed and in bath rubs what is this really all about
[02:11:51.360 --> 02:11:55.520]  are they acting like they don't care that we know because they actually do
[02:11:55.520 --> 02:12:02.320]  care John Rappaport it's a complicated situation but point number one is I
[02:12:02.320 --> 02:12:10.000]  think they have to make a pretense that this is now public because it is because
[02:12:10.000 --> 02:12:15.680]  it's been exposed so they can't go around anymore saying secret Bilderberg
[02:12:15.680 --> 02:12:20.160]  secret Bilderberg because everybody knows about it now or I mean through info
[02:12:20.160 --> 02:12:26.200]  wars and other alternative media people realize it so they have to make a
[02:12:26.200 --> 02:12:31.200]  pretense of saying they're public otherwise they could be indicted they
[02:12:31.200 --> 02:12:35.360]  couldn't be indicted for doing national government business as an
[02:12:35.360 --> 02:12:41.320]  international secret society which they are so on the one hand they've got to
[02:12:41.320 --> 02:12:46.680]  now sort of give the impression hey we're not we're trying to conceal anything
[02:12:46.680 --> 02:12:51.080]  we're here we are you know and we'll have a conversation with you and with you
[02:12:51.080 --> 02:12:56.920]  and so on so forth on the other hand you've got some of the crazier members
[02:12:56.920 --> 02:13:01.840]  who are still back in the Stone Age trying to conceal the whole thing and
[02:13:01.840 --> 02:13:06.640]  blocking out windows and then you've got the real looms in their you know white
[02:13:06.640 --> 02:13:13.680]  bath robes doing God knows what reminds me of your old expose of the Bohemian
[02:13:13.680 --> 02:13:18.720]  Grove business I mean so I think you've got several different factions there
[02:13:18.720 --> 02:13:23.440]  operating at the same time giving a contradictory appearance but the main
[02:13:23.440 --> 02:13:28.960]  thrust here is I think they finally decided that they have to now pretend
[02:13:28.960 --> 02:13:33.680]  that they're out in the open so that they can avoid criminal prosecution
[02:13:33.680 --> 02:13:39.720]  because I mean you can't no nation's laws permit government people to go to
[02:13:39.720 --> 02:13:45.880]  a secret international conference and make policy decisions outside their own
[02:13:45.880 --> 02:13:49.560]  government I mean they put you in prison for that if they catch you or if they
[02:13:49.560 --> 02:13:54.360]  want to catch you so that's why I think you're seeing a little bit of this oh
[02:13:54.360 --> 02:13:58.240]  you know we're just a bunch of guys sitting around of course we're meeting
[02:13:58.240 --> 02:14:06.000]  here we're not trying to hide anything and I looked up the floor plan of that
[02:14:06.000 --> 02:14:12.960]  Marriott conference center the gym is down on the lower floor they were in a
[02:14:12.960 --> 02:14:19.160]  suite in a bunch of bathrooms holding on to each other with a pretty boy in the
[02:14:19.160 --> 02:14:24.280]  middle of them flaunting and and teasing everyone and I mean that's very
[02:14:24.280 --> 02:14:28.640]  sophomoric behavior and I don't know what the point of it is but and I agree
[02:14:28.640 --> 02:14:32.440]  with you it just it shows different factions and that's what it is bidding
[02:14:32.440 --> 02:14:36.160]  for control of the of the main levers of power now I want to talk about the
[02:14:36.160 --> 02:14:40.040]  essence of being free we don't need government to make us free we begin to
[02:14:40.040 --> 02:14:45.360]  act like free beings and the rest will follow we ran out of time Sunday talking
[02:14:45.360 --> 02:14:49.240]  about that I wanted to recap that briefly as we go to break but before we go
[02:14:49.240 --> 02:14:52.120]  there and come back with your energy presentation that I won't be here for
[02:14:52.120 --> 02:14:55.560]  you'll have a six-minute segment an 18-minute segment and a six-minute
[02:14:55.560 --> 02:15:00.200]  segment to finish out the show here today because I don't want you to be
[02:15:00.200 --> 02:15:05.480]  interrupted getting into that John but I want to be clear on energy I want to
[02:15:05.480 --> 02:15:10.560]  explore our oil I want to explore natural gas I want to use cold as we have
[02:15:10.560 --> 02:15:14.280]  clean burning plants because that's the energy we have but I also know they've
[02:15:14.280 --> 02:15:17.560]  blocked a lot of the free energy the zero point stuff it's come out they've
[02:15:17.560 --> 02:15:21.760]  been blocking it discrediting it trying to control the new energy systems by
[02:15:21.760 --> 02:15:25.280]  only giving money to their friends who never even build anything or build
[02:15:25.280 --> 02:15:28.640]  something that's a fraud or build something that's 60 year old alternative
[02:15:28.640 --> 02:15:33.040]  energy so they're blocking renaissance in this and some of the you know alternative
[02:15:33.040 --> 02:15:37.200]  energy people go how dare you promote you know an oil boom in the US while
[02:15:37.200 --> 02:15:40.360]  claiming you're for new forms of energy well that's hypocritical of course I'm
[02:15:40.360 --> 02:15:44.560]  for more whatever we've currently got we need more of better than the Saudi
[02:15:44.560 --> 02:15:49.160]  Arabians better to have low prices while developing new systems I don't think the
[02:15:49.160 --> 02:15:55.200]  two conflict with each other at all I mean I'm absolutely for North American
[02:15:55.200 --> 02:15:59.800]  oil exploration I want to be done good I don't like fracking in populated areas
[02:15:59.800 --> 02:16:03.840]  there's a good way to do fracking versus a bad way they can define fracking as
[02:16:03.840 --> 02:16:07.200]  any type of drilling so I mean it's the Saudi Arabians we've caught them
[02:16:07.200 --> 02:16:12.040]  funding the main anti-fracking movement that's just a fact you know and because
[02:16:12.040 --> 02:16:15.760]  they don't want stuff being developed here well most of our oil exploration is
[02:16:15.760 --> 02:16:19.560]  not fracking so I want to let you break it all down coming up I wanted to throw
[02:16:19.560 --> 02:16:24.640]  that in now take us out to break we're going to break here in about three
[02:16:24.640 --> 02:16:27.840]  minutes so I'm not gonna turn things over to you John you'll hear the music you
[02:16:27.840 --> 02:16:31.160]  take us out you introist we'll take the training wheels off here and let you
[02:16:31.160 --> 02:16:34.720]  host the show because you're you know a great guy and I know can do it but
[02:16:34.720 --> 02:16:38.920]  briefly take us out what the essence of freedom is for John Rappaport and I
[02:16:38.920 --> 02:16:43.840]  will see everybody else tomorrow at 11 a.m. Central here with the weekday show
[02:16:43.840 --> 02:16:49.680]  Alex Jones handing the baton off to John Rappaport thanks so much Alex at the
[02:16:49.680 --> 02:16:55.120]  end of the Sunday conversation that we had you made the point and it's
[02:16:55.120 --> 02:16:59.360]  absolutely correct that freedom is not something that's given to you by the
[02:16:59.360 --> 02:17:04.880]  government I don't care what the documents are even the founding documents the
[02:17:04.880 --> 02:17:09.440]  founding documents did not create freedom as if it had never existed before
[02:17:09.440 --> 02:17:14.800]  you individually have your freedom you've always had your freedom everybody
[02:17:14.800 --> 02:17:18.920]  has that potential within them and they have to know what that means at a
[02:17:18.920 --> 02:17:22.960]  profound level not just some superficial level because once you
[02:17:22.960 --> 02:17:28.560]  understand what it really means your own freedom independent from anything else
[02:17:28.560 --> 02:17:33.080]  then you begin to understand what you need to do now in this situation that
[02:17:33.080 --> 02:17:38.200]  we find ourselves and that's the big one but that's the first step the
[02:17:38.200 --> 02:17:43.800]  Constitution did not create freedom the Articles of Confederation the
[02:17:43.800 --> 02:17:48.720]  Declaration of Independence they did not give people freedom that was never
[02:17:48.720 --> 02:17:54.120]  there to begin with it confirmed the freedom that every individual has and
[02:17:54.120 --> 02:17:59.560]  think of the disaster if individuals don't understand within themselves what
[02:17:59.560 --> 02:18:04.840]  their own freedom really is at the most profound level then we're done that has
[02:18:04.840 --> 02:18:12.960]  to change that has to really really change so that's where we're going with
[02:18:12.960 --> 02:18:20.400]  that conversation about freedom it means that every individual begins with a
[02:18:20.400 --> 02:18:25.240]  contemplation of what his own liberty and freedom really means to him does it
[02:18:25.240 --> 02:18:29.880]  mean that you can buy a soda at the 7-eleven instead of at the liquor store
[02:18:29.880 --> 02:18:36.480]  is that where it goes does it mean that you can buy you know a two-seater couch
[02:18:36.480 --> 02:18:44.760]  instead of a chair or a 1999 car that's been completely remodeled I mean is
[02:18:44.760 --> 02:18:48.920]  that the limit of what freedom means that you can take a vacation is that
[02:18:48.920 --> 02:18:53.080]  what it's all about is that the beginning and the end of it is freedom
[02:18:53.080 --> 02:18:57.240]  mean that you can shut your eyes to what's happening in the world and that
[02:18:57.240 --> 02:19:00.560]  nobody's going to punish you for retreating into a little borough
[02:19:00.560 --> 02:19:08.400]  somewhere is that what your freedom means nobody can say to you what your
[02:19:08.400 --> 02:19:14.320]  freedom you have to find you have to decide and you have to go down below the
[02:19:14.320 --> 02:19:21.920]  everyday nonsense of social conversation and mainstream media and so forth to
[02:19:21.920 --> 02:19:25.680]  find out what that is you would think that would be part of the educational
[02:19:25.680 --> 02:19:30.000]  system don't you think so Thomas Jefferson as part of the founding of
[02:19:30.000 --> 02:19:36.600]  the public education system wanted it to be the education of citizens because
[02:19:36.600 --> 02:19:41.880]  why because he said this was a republic unlike any other form of government
[02:19:41.880 --> 02:19:45.800]  that ever existed therefore the entire purpose of the education system should
[02:19:45.800 --> 02:19:50.280]  be to educate children into understanding what the role of the
[02:19:50.280 --> 02:19:56.760]  citizen would be in a republic do you find any discussion of freedom now in

[02:24:07.440 --> 02:24:10.920]  John Raffer Ford sitting in for Alex for the rest of the hour
[02:24:10.920 --> 02:24:15.600]  Ford radio just to wrap up what I was saying about freedom do you know any
[02:24:15.600 --> 02:24:24.400]  schools in America this is the issue as it should be a 2000 word essay on what
[02:24:24.400 --> 02:24:32.680]  it means to you to be free in this country now why not indeed why not what
[02:24:32.680 --> 02:24:36.640]  could be a greater issue but if you happen to bring that up in the school
[02:24:36.640 --> 02:24:40.920]  these days I mean you could be suspended who knows what would happen
[02:24:40.920 --> 02:24:47.000]  individual freedom in an elementary school in a high school in a college
[02:24:47.000 --> 02:24:53.080]  university it could be stoned I mean this is verboten you cannot bring up
[02:24:53.080 --> 02:24:59.520]  this subject this is not a subject for discussion much less assignment in
[02:24:59.520 --> 02:25:03.680]  classes professor gets up at the beginning of a class in college and says
[02:25:03.680 --> 02:25:07.640]  the most important thing you can learn about in college is your individual
[02:25:07.640 --> 02:25:12.160]  freedom and that's what we're going to focus on in this class in full philosophy
[02:25:12.160 --> 02:25:19.400]  of ubladi whatever that guy's on a short leash from that moment on that
[02:25:19.400 --> 02:25:26.600]  teacher his career is going to be sidetracked if he persists in that and
[02:25:26.600 --> 02:25:30.760]  yet that's the basis of the country that's what the Constitution was
[02:25:30.760 --> 02:25:35.160]  Declaration of Independence what happened complete overthrow that's what
[02:25:35.160 --> 02:25:42.320]  happened but that doesn't stop you as an individual from doing that work
[02:25:42.320 --> 02:25:47.960]  because when you hit page and you really understand at the most profound
[02:25:47.960 --> 02:25:56.120]  level what your freedom really means what it is then you know what to do then
[02:25:56.120 --> 02:26:01.640]  you understand then you can apply your mind not to some harebrained scheme but
[02:26:01.640 --> 02:26:07.480]  to something that's going to contribute to turning this whole whole massive
[02:26:07.480 --> 02:26:18.360]  fascist oligarchy around okay energy so now 30% we're gonna cut 30% of coal no
[02:26:18.360 --> 02:26:23.040]  problem the president says this in fact is going to create more jobs it's a
[02:26:23.040 --> 02:26:28.800]  miracle I mean he's got to be a magician it's not an outright messiah if he can
[02:26:28.800 --> 02:26:37.000]  cut coal by 30% and yet in the process create more jobs and even more energy
[02:26:37.000 --> 02:26:42.280]  this is like saying today is tomorrow night is day day is night it's all 1984
[02:26:42.280 --> 02:26:49.260]  lingo at the same time as Alex said in the last segment and this is very
[02:26:49.260 --> 02:26:55.160]  important you've got to keep the energy you have while you actually develop
[02:26:55.160 --> 02:27:01.840]  energy of the future and I'm sorry to insult certain environment analysts
[02:27:01.840 --> 02:27:06.320]  about this who I guess want to go back into the forest and scratch on the
[02:27:06.320 --> 02:27:11.320]  ground for roots and tubers and depopulate the planet down to about a
[02:27:11.320 --> 02:27:15.680]  hundred million people but in a society of civilization you've got to keep the
[02:27:15.680 --> 02:27:24.040]  energy you have while you develop actual new energy not phony new energy real new
[02:27:24.040 --> 02:27:28.560]  energy energy in fact energy technology that's been suppressed for a long time
[02:27:28.560 --> 02:27:33.680]  which is what I'm going to get into for the remainder of the hour here actual
[02:27:33.680 --> 02:27:40.360]  energy suppression for example take the case of one Frank Schuman ever hear of
[02:27:40.360 --> 02:27:50.800]  Frank Schuman a scientist an engineer 1862 to 1918 he was one of the primary
[02:27:50.800 --> 02:27:56.440]  originators of solar power solar panels he discovered a way to transfer solar
[02:27:56.440 --> 02:28:03.600]  energy into pipes within panels and in fact he built a factory in Egypt which
[02:28:03.600 --> 02:28:11.120]  apparently runs to this present day based entirely on solar in Mahadee pumps
[02:28:11.120 --> 02:28:19.480]  out 6,000 gallons of water this solar energy engine per minute 6,000 gallons
[02:28:19.480 --> 02:28:24.480]  per minute to cotton fields along on the Nile that's real that's pretty good
[02:28:24.480 --> 02:28:29.400]  that was back in the earliest days of the 20th century that this happened this
[02:28:29.400 --> 02:28:36.720]  was the real technology back then this had real legs this could be utilized in
[02:28:36.720 --> 02:28:40.880]  fact was utilized if you look at no photographs of Los Angeles all the way
[02:28:40.880 --> 02:28:47.120]  along the line in the early teens of the 20th century you could see solar panels
[02:28:47.120 --> 02:28:53.440]  on all the houses until the oil boom hit and it became obvious that this could
[02:28:53.440 --> 02:28:59.920]  be a monopoly for the future we may not be able to control the Sun boys because
[02:28:59.920 --> 02:29:04.520]  everybody's got access to it but we can certainly control the oil so what we have
[02:29:04.520 --> 02:29:11.440]  to do is destroy suppressed to fame propagandize against all other forms of
[02:29:11.440 --> 02:29:16.900]  phony phony baloney energy and say it's all about oil it always was and it
[02:29:16.900 --> 02:29:21.320]  always will be and you still to this day your propaganda just with that line
[02:29:21.320 --> 02:29:26.800]  whenever anybody really seriously brings up alternative energy I'm not talking
[02:29:26.800 --> 02:29:32.680]  about Obama or Bush or Clinton alternative energy I'm talking about the
[02:29:32.680 --> 02:29:38.720]  real thing which is a separate issue quite apart from these phony scheme to
[02:29:38.720 --> 02:29:43.600]  create what looks like alternative energy when it actually is we're going out
[02:29:43.600 --> 02:29:46.560]  here at the bottom in the hour I'm sitting in for Alex Jones this is John
[02:29:46.560 --> 02:29:51.840]  Raffa port and we will be back after this break break we're on the March the

[02:30:01.800 --> 02:30:05.640]  Ralph just won't pay any attention to me when he comes home from work all he ever
[02:30:05.640 --> 02:30:10.040]  does is play video games and go to sleep it's like I don't even exist oh Betty
[02:30:10.040 --> 02:30:14.320]  that's just awful does this seem familiar if the answer to this question is

[02:31:05.880 --> 02:31:10.240]  his team of Patriots over at my Patriots supply several years ago Matt was
[02:31:10.240 --> 02:31:13.200]  sitting in his two bedroom apartment frustrated with the direction this
[02:31:13.200 --> 02:31:16.760]  country was headed and the charlottes willing to sell us out for a quick buck
[02:31:16.760 --> 02:31:21.680]  deciding to take action a company run by Patriots for Patriots was born by
[02:31:21.680 --> 02:31:25.880]  Patriots supply has never taken a loan or accepted outside funding they now

[02:33:30.200 --> 02:33:36.320]  just want to mention the tremendous work that all the crew at info wars do I
[02:33:36.320 --> 02:33:41.880]  mean because I've been a reporter for 30 years I understand how operations work
[02:33:41.880 --> 02:33:47.720]  and to put this together without you know government subsidies and all kinds
[02:33:47.720 --> 02:33:54.440]  of easy cash to actually make this an entrepreneurial news independent
[02:33:54.440 --> 02:34:00.520]  operation is far from easy especially with about 50 people on board the
[02:34:00.520 --> 02:34:07.280]  reporters in the crew do a great job and they finance this whole operation on
[02:34:07.280 --> 02:34:14.800]  the basis of the products that they tell you about that you buy that are the best
[02:34:14.800 --> 02:34:20.160]  products that can possibly bring to you that you will find at info wars life
[02:34:20.160 --> 02:34:26.960]  dot com which is the store especially two new products x2 which is a nascent
[02:34:26.960 --> 02:34:33.760]  iodine and superfemale vitality those are two of the newest products in the
[02:34:33.760 --> 02:34:39.720]  store I urge you to look into this go to info wars life calm the store and
[02:34:39.720 --> 02:34:46.760]  support the crew at info wars and get yourself access to unique products at
[02:34:46.760 --> 02:34:54.800]  the same time okay okay make sure you do that we're getting back to energy and
[02:34:54.800 --> 02:35:01.440]  of course those products are about energy energy is everywhere how much
[02:35:01.440 --> 02:35:06.840]  energy do you have today can you last can you get through the day how many cups
[02:35:06.840 --> 02:35:12.920]  of coffee do you need how many red bowls everybody is involved with energy on some
[02:35:12.920 --> 02:35:17.440]  level whether it's personal energy energy to run their machines their
[02:35:17.440 --> 02:35:24.160]  devices their cars their houses their offices places of business the society
[02:35:24.160 --> 02:35:32.800]  the civilization runs on energy so what's the problem well we don't have a
[02:35:32.800 --> 02:35:39.280]  problem with that the problem is that the people who control this planet the
[02:35:39.280 --> 02:35:46.200]  elites they want to dominate the energy monopoly cartel that's what we're
[02:35:46.200 --> 02:35:52.600]  talking about and oil is the perfect mechanism for this to do and they can
[02:35:52.600 --> 02:35:57.120]  format wars in the Middle East where a lot of the oil is and they can make oil
[02:35:57.120 --> 02:36:01.440]  seem scarcer and they can raise the price and they can manipulate the price
[02:36:01.440 --> 02:36:09.320]  up and down because they control the basic energy commodity of the planet in
[02:36:09.320 --> 02:36:16.480]  their view which they are promoting to you to everybody this is what we have
[02:36:16.480 --> 02:36:21.120]  folks we have oil that's all we have there's nothing else really if we give
[02:36:21.120 --> 02:36:25.800]  up the oil we're all going to go into the darkness and the chaos which is a
[02:36:25.800 --> 02:36:31.840]  complete lie because there have been many suppressed energy technologies not
[02:36:31.840 --> 02:36:37.320]  the woo-woo fairy tale I put a crystal on the mantle and looked at it and
[02:36:37.320 --> 02:36:42.600]  suddenly my car started driving down the street I'm not talking about that I'm
[02:36:42.600 --> 02:36:46.840]  talking about Frank Schumann that I spoke about in the last segment this
[02:36:46.840 --> 02:36:53.520]  was a guy who pine an engineer who pioneered engines that ran on solar in
[02:36:53.520 --> 02:36:59.400]  the beginning of the 20th century what happened to that that was an existing
[02:36:59.400 --> 02:37:05.480]  workable useful dramatic breakthrough technology right then and there at the
[02:37:05.480 --> 02:37:12.360]  beginning of the 20th century 1913 started pumping 6,000 gallons of water
[02:37:12.360 --> 02:37:18.600]  per minute through that solar energy off of the Nile into cotton fields in
[02:37:18.600 --> 02:37:26.480]  Egypt you would think somebody would get a clue from that revolutionized let me
[02:37:26.480 --> 02:37:29.240]  tell you about something really extraordinary
[02:37:29.240 --> 02:37:39.920]  Passamaquoddy Passamaquoddy the main state of Maine Passamaquoddy title
[02:37:39.920 --> 02:37:48.080]  basin project that JFK was obsessively interested in since his days as a US
[02:37:48.080 --> 02:37:53.840]  senator we're talking in the 19 late 1950s in 1959 he went up to the state of
[02:37:53.840 --> 02:38:00.240]  Maine and looked over this proposal to build a title basin project right off
[02:38:00.240 --> 02:38:08.080]  the coast of Maine with a huge turbine because the height of the water tied
[02:38:08.080 --> 02:38:13.640]  every day was very high and very low and very high and very low very good for
[02:38:13.640 --> 02:38:18.240]  turning a turbine and creating electricity an enormous amount of
[02:38:18.240 --> 02:38:27.160]  electricity get this for the state of Maine in 1962 he commissioned a report
[02:38:27.160 --> 02:38:32.720]  he was president then what is happening with Passamaquoddy it's being sold all
[02:38:32.720 --> 02:38:37.440]  these years different entities are fighting over it different cartels are
[02:38:37.440 --> 02:38:42.720]  trying to stop it I want to report the report was turned into president Kennedy
[02:38:42.720 --> 02:38:49.280]  it was a positive report on the possibilities from Passamaquoddy the
[02:38:49.280 --> 02:38:54.960]  title basin project shortly after that JFK was murdered and the whole project
[02:38:54.960 --> 02:39:03.240]  went into abeyance it's not just the Passamaquoddy project it's anywhere in
[02:39:03.240 --> 02:39:09.320]  the country in America it's anywhere in the world where there is a coastal
[02:39:09.320 --> 02:39:16.040]  inlet that has those conditions there are many many many many coastal inlets
[02:39:16.040 --> 02:39:21.720]  all over the world that could be used to build these water turbine projects this
[02:39:21.720 --> 02:39:28.320]  is not woo-woo fairy tale up in the clouds alternative energy this is straight
[02:39:28.320 --> 02:39:33.720]  ahead down the line electricity production using the ocean using the
[02:39:33.720 --> 02:39:40.360]  tides and turbines everybody knows about this there's at least one company I
[02:39:40.360 --> 02:39:44.520]  researched some years ago there are probably more now that can put small
[02:39:44.520 --> 02:39:51.120]  turbines in rivers and produce energy for local communities this is not
[02:39:51.120 --> 02:39:57.640]  strange weird stuff this is real stuff and remember Nikola Tesla the famous
[02:39:57.640 --> 02:40:04.240]  inventor when he died the FBI and instantly raided his hotel room and took
[02:40:04.240 --> 02:40:07.560]  all of his papers and confiscated them and what were those papers all about
[02:40:07.560 --> 02:40:13.720]  that have never been returned they're about alternative energy which is really
[02:40:13.720 --> 02:40:20.840]  mainstream breakthrough energy when Tesla envisioned being able to supply free
[02:40:20.840 --> 02:40:29.560]  energy to the entire planet or pennies worth of costs for free energy for the
[02:40:29.560 --> 02:40:36.360]  entire planet what are we talking about when we talk about human health folks
[02:40:36.360 --> 02:40:40.880]  think about this come on we're talking about energy what's the difference in
[02:40:40.880 --> 02:40:46.920]  energy level between a very sick person and a very healthy person human energy
[02:40:46.920 --> 02:40:53.880]  not just energy to run cars human energy we've had a great deal of suppressed
[02:40:53.880 --> 02:40:59.520]  research about that starting not starting with but including Royal Rife the
[02:40:59.520 --> 02:41:05.120]  famous scientists in Southern California who developed his own breakthrough
[02:41:05.120 --> 02:41:13.680]  microscope that could observe microorganisms in action and his frequency
[02:41:13.680 --> 02:41:18.840]  generator that he used to experiment on these microorganisms and
[02:41:18.840 --> 02:41:26.120]  kill off destructive ones with frequencies in his time you can see the
[02:41:26.120 --> 02:41:30.400]  newspaper articles they appeared in Southern California he was heralded as
[02:41:30.400 --> 02:41:36.680]  a genius by medical authorities until until he decided not to cooperate with
[02:41:36.680 --> 02:41:41.760]  them to form any sort of cooperative business venture at which point he
[02:41:41.760 --> 02:41:46.160]  became persona non grata at which point he became a fraud all of a sudden the
[02:41:46.160 --> 02:41:50.240]  man was a fraud he was a genius yesterday now he's a fraud now he's
[02:41:50.240 --> 02:41:55.440]  dangerous now he's evil now he's distracting people away from what can
[02:41:55.440 --> 02:42:04.680]  really cure cancer baby life cured what was it 16 people of cancer who were
[02:42:04.680 --> 02:42:10.800]  seriously ill with cancer the newspaper articles appeared on this it was
[02:42:10.800 --> 02:42:16.240]  verified and then suddenly it never happened suddenly it didn't happen do
[02:42:16.240 --> 02:42:22.000]  you realize what we're talking about in terms of human energy uptake the
[02:42:22.000 --> 02:42:26.720]  difference between somebody who's in desperate straits with cancer and a
[02:42:26.720 --> 02:42:32.400]  cured individual what about Stan virginski down in Texas
[02:42:32.400 --> 02:42:38.520]  Houston what is it seven grand juries state and federal that have been
[02:42:38.520 --> 02:42:44.600]  mounted to destroy virginski because he invented his own medicine to treat
[02:42:44.600 --> 02:42:51.000]  cancer that was not part of the not part of the pharmaceutical complex that
[02:42:51.000 --> 02:42:58.200]  worked on a number of patients virginski never overstated what he could do with
[02:42:58.200 --> 02:43:03.800]  his medicine neoplastin he continued to do research he continued to treat
[02:43:03.800 --> 02:43:10.520]  people I know a guy in Los Angeles personally who lives for I'm going to
[02:43:10.520 --> 02:43:15.680]  say 20 to 25 years longer than doctors said he could because he was treated by
[02:43:15.680 --> 02:43:21.600]  virginski and yet now tremendous strictures and restraints on which
[02:43:21.600 --> 02:43:27.360]  patients virginski is allowed to treat who can come to his clinic what can he
[02:43:27.360 --> 02:43:33.360]  do with people as a doctor and the legal assault never seems to stop on the guy
[02:43:33.360 --> 02:43:38.680]  grand jury after grand jury they can indict a ham sandwich it's a saying
[02:43:38.680 --> 02:43:44.320]  about a grand jury but no grand jury ever indicted virginski why because they
[02:43:44.320 --> 02:43:48.680]  all realize that the DA's and the prosecutors were lying through their
[02:43:48.680 --> 02:43:53.840]  teeth when they tried to destroy this humanitarian doctor in Texas and so they
[02:43:53.840 --> 02:44:02.400]  refused to turn back permission to prosecute we're talking about human
[02:44:02.400 --> 02:44:08.240]  energy there which is at least as vital as the energy to power a civilization
[02:44:08.240 --> 02:44:13.680]  through cables through wireless means whatever we're looking at suppression of
[02:44:13.680 --> 02:44:21.120]  alternative technologies from top to bottom all over the place everywhere and
[02:44:21.120 --> 02:44:29.920]  this JFK pass a McQuaddie story you check it out on Google in depth Andrea
[02:44:29.920 --> 02:44:35.920]  Silver formed I believe is the woman's name who did the original research on the
[02:44:35.920 --> 02:44:41.520]  full story behind this the full story we're talking about you want a conspiracy
[02:44:41.520 --> 02:44:48.240]  and a scandal a devastating scandal that ends up one way or another with the
[02:44:48.240 --> 02:44:55.920]  murder of a US president and a project to liberate the country from oil
[02:44:55.920 --> 02:45:04.600]  monopolies pass a McQuaddie these are incredible stories that I'm talking
[02:45:04.600 --> 02:45:10.440]  about here incredible human events and what do they all point to they point to
[02:45:10.440 --> 02:45:18.440]  the fact that for a very long time we the human race have had the capacity to
[02:45:18.440 --> 02:45:25.880]  produce energy abundance in every conceivable way from many different vectors
[02:45:25.880 --> 02:45:31.640]  on this planet and that this has been suppressed by the energy cartels and
[02:45:31.640 --> 02:45:36.960]  monopolies and by the secret societies like Bilderberger like the Council on
[02:45:36.960 --> 02:45:42.000]  Foreign Relations like the Trilateral Commission like the CIA like many
[02:45:42.000 --> 02:45:49.280]  different groups behind the scenes like the mega corporations operating in
[02:45:49.280 --> 02:45:55.320]  concert with intelligence agencies I'm not blowing smoke here folks abundance
[02:45:55.320 --> 02:46:03.000]  is a viable principle that exists now for everybody on the planet through the
[02:46:03.000 --> 02:46:09.200]  means that have been discovered and invented and then suppressed suppressed
[02:46:09.200 --> 02:46:16.880]  to create the scarcity that we now face the artificial money scarcity the
[02:46:16.880 --> 02:46:21.600]  artificial job destruction the artificial health destruction through the
[02:46:21.600 --> 02:46:27.320]  practice of toxic modern medicine the artificial destruction of different
[02:46:27.320 --> 02:46:33.840]  avenues of energy from solar and ocean to more sophisticated means as in the
[02:46:33.840 --> 02:46:41.320]  case of Tesla the destruction of all of that by their suppression so that you
[02:46:41.320 --> 02:46:49.000]  and I and everybody else are now living in an artificially created world that's
[02:46:49.000 --> 02:46:55.680]  the reality that has been imposed upon us and thousands and hundreds of
[02:46:55.680 --> 02:47:02.240]  thousands of lying deceiving scum propagandist pundits fake
[02:47:02.240 --> 02:47:10.680]  sciences have cooperated have sold their souls to prop up the idea that we are
[02:47:10.680 --> 02:47:20.080]  living in a world on a planet of extreme scarcity and its tooth for tooth claw
[02:47:20.080 --> 02:47:26.440]  against claw all the way when that has not been the case for a very long time
[02:47:26.440 --> 02:47:32.920]  this is the secret in the temple of the monopolies this is what they are
[02:47:32.920 --> 02:47:39.240]  concealing and in the field of energy it's absolutely monstrous and there are
[02:47:39.240 --> 02:47:45.000]  many more energy breakthroughs that I could mention here but I wanted to focus
[02:47:45.000 --> 02:47:53.280]  on a few to set you exploring to set you finding out for yourself this is the
[02:47:53.280 --> 02:47:58.960]  case when you drive your car to the pump and you look at the price you're not
[02:47:58.960 --> 02:48:04.560]  just looking at the manipulated money price of oil you're looking at it at
[02:48:04.560 --> 02:48:11.760]  far greater manipulation you're looking at the destruction of societies and
[02:48:11.760 --> 02:48:18.600]  civilizations based on this premise that oil is all we've got folks oil is all
[02:48:18.600 --> 02:48:24.880]  we'll ever have and to assure you once again I'm not with the people who say
[02:48:24.880 --> 02:48:28.120]  well we have to shut down all the oil and while we're at it all the coal and
[02:48:28.120 --> 02:48:33.400]  shut down everything because I want to go out into the forest and crawl along
[02:48:33.400 --> 02:48:43.200]  the floor and eat roots and tubers and live in a tree that's not my goal in
[02:48:43.200 --> 02:48:50.160]  life I'm not talking about that I'm talking about the fact that we keep the
[02:48:50.160 --> 02:48:58.560]  energy avenues open that we have now and we actually let in the door the
[02:48:58.560 --> 02:49:06.200]  suppressed technologies which by now would have obviated our need for oil it
[02:49:06.200 --> 02:49:10.840]  would have been done as it was supposed to be done you see it's not
[02:49:10.840 --> 02:49:16.360]  depopulate the planet let's go back to living in trees and let the few barons
[02:49:16.360 --> 02:49:23.200]  of the estate run the entire earth that's not the picture that was never a
[02:49:23.200 --> 02:49:29.280]  sane picture for anybody only the lunatics running the asylum thought that
[02:49:29.280 --> 02:49:37.200]  was a good idea and still think it is no in the natural scheme of things by the
[02:49:37.200 --> 02:49:44.160]  early part of the 20th century oil would have started to be overtaken it would
[02:49:44.160 --> 02:49:49.520]  have happened and the technologies that Tesla and others developed would have by
[02:49:49.520 --> 02:49:54.880]  now overtaken oil and we would be living in a different world where every human
[02:49:54.880 --> 02:50:05.760]  would have access to energy every human minus nobody would have access to all
[02:50:05.760 --> 02:50:13.800]  the energy they need if these technologies had not been suppressed no
[02:50:13.800 --> 02:50:22.760]  question about it ditto for the field of healing by now we would have seen
[02:50:22.760 --> 02:50:32.240]  incredible breakthrough healing of the entire range of human disease if
[02:50:32.240 --> 02:50:39.440]  technologies have been allowed to develop that's all we needed okay we're
[02:50:39.440 --> 02:50:43.080]  coming to a break here this is John Rappaport sitting in for Alex Jones on

[02:51:15.720 --> 02:51:20.320]  sell us out for a quick buck deciding to take action a company run by Patriots
[02:51:20.320 --> 02:51:24.920]  for Patriots was born MyPatriot Supply has never taken a loan or accepted

[02:54:11.880 --> 02:54:19.360]  sitting in for Alex Jones on our last segment talking about energy energy
[02:54:19.360 --> 02:54:27.520]  suppression I was reminded that take these names down Nick Gonzalez doctor in
[02:54:27.520 --> 02:54:33.400]  New York Stan Brzezinski doctor in Houston Dr. Joseph Gold in New York
[02:54:33.400 --> 02:54:41.720]  State three breakthrough technologies medical technologies and I don't mean
[02:54:41.720 --> 02:54:46.200]  by that oh this cheers everybody all the time people sometimes write to me really
[02:54:46.200 --> 02:54:50.880]  think I am some kind of a complete rube take this and everybody in the world
[02:54:50.880 --> 02:54:58.680]  will be cured all the time hold on what these doctors were saying is very
[02:54:58.680 --> 02:55:05.520]  promising it works we've seen it work we want to study it further because we know
[02:55:05.520 --> 02:55:13.640]  it can be applied to more people it's been shown to work with gold it was
[02:55:13.640 --> 02:55:20.680]  hydrazine sulfate for cancer patients Nick Gonzalez in New York an enzyme and
[02:55:20.680 --> 02:55:27.440]  nutritional protocol for cancer Stan Brzezinski in Houston neoplastin's a
[02:55:27.440 --> 02:55:31.440]  protocol for cancer and here's the kicker folks
[02:55:31.440 --> 02:55:38.000]  eventually all these three were studied by the official domain of medical
[02:55:38.000 --> 02:55:44.800]  science in other words clinical trial with volunteers forced into it by
[02:55:44.800 --> 02:55:48.800]  pressure and pressure all right we'll look at it we'll look at it and then
[02:55:48.800 --> 02:55:54.920]  every single one of those clinical trials in all these cases were perverted
[02:55:54.920 --> 02:56:02.160]  and twisted the protocols were changed to produce a negative and disastrous
[02:56:02.160 --> 02:56:08.640]  outcome that's what we're dealing with here murderers that's what we're dealing
[02:56:08.640 --> 02:56:14.320]  with people who murder in order to protect in this case a monopoly of the
[02:56:14.320 --> 02:56:21.600]  toxic drug pharmaceutical complex and cartel but the difference between
[02:56:21.600 --> 02:56:27.360]  sickness and health is all about energy the difference between a society of
[02:56:27.360 --> 02:56:32.240]  scarcity and abundance is all about energy and if you want to talk about
[02:56:32.240 --> 02:56:41.040]  free energy what it really means is not just energy out of nowhere it means
[02:56:41.040 --> 02:56:48.720]  actual energy delivered for free or for pennies to everybody on the planet yes
[02:56:48.720 --> 02:56:53.080]  it can be sold of course it can be sold it doesn't have to be sold at any kind
[02:56:53.080 --> 02:56:57.800]  of a high price it can be sold for pennies to everybody in which case
[02:56:57.800 --> 02:57:03.080]  whoever is producing this technology however many companies are all making a
[02:57:03.080 --> 02:57:09.320]  nice profit nobody's suffering everybody's having an abundance of energy
[02:57:09.320 --> 02:57:20.200]  we have to liberate this fact about where the world is now we have to liberate
[02:57:20.200 --> 02:57:24.920]  these technologies and more technologies that will give us the
[02:57:24.920 --> 02:57:28.640]  abundance that we need in terms of human energy and the energy to run
[02:57:28.640 --> 02:57:34.120]  civilization that's the agenda that's the agenda that the elites are trying to
[02:57:34.120 --> 02:57:40.480]  destroy and distract us from with all of this other insanity that goes on day by
[02:57:40.480 --> 02:57:49.000]  day by day by day that's why wars are created at the highest level control the
[02:57:49.000 --> 02:57:57.800]  monopoly control the one basic form of energy that we have the big lie distract
[02:57:57.800 --> 02:58:02.160]  everybody give them all kinds of high-flying idealistic reasons for war
[02:58:02.160 --> 02:58:06.800]  and destroying each other oh yes we have to do it in the name of this and that the
[02:58:06.800 --> 02:58:12.720]  other thing no all you have to do is turn your attention to the suppressed
[02:58:12.720 --> 02:58:17.680]  technologies thanks so much folks for tuning in John Rappaport sitting in for
[02:58:17.680 --> 02:58:25.000]  Alex Jones infowars radio my site is no more fake news.com you can read my work
[02:58:25.000 --> 02:58:43.160]  there we'll see you up the road.
