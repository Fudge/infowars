[00:00.000 --> 00:05.600]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[00:05.600 --> 00:08.400]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:21.400 --> 00:24.500]  It is Wednesday, February 5, 2020.
[00:24.500 --> 00:26.700]  I'm your host, Alex Jones.
[00:26.700 --> 00:30.000]  I'm Alex Troyer. We'll be co-hosting via the ATX.
[00:30.000 --> 00:38.400]  Look at this Newsweek article that right now is the top story on Google and on Apple News.
[00:38.400 --> 00:44.200]  This is what the establishment has decided to run today with all the huge news,
[00:44.200 --> 00:53.200]  the State of the Union, the out of control coronavirus that now evidence is mounting is a man-made biological weapon.
[00:53.200 --> 01:04.200]  Despite all of that, Alex Jones' InfoWars YouTube videos uploaded by Proxy accounts attracted hundreds of thousands of views despite ban.
[01:04.200 --> 01:12.200]  So they're doing this to act like I'm totally banned everywhere and to create the illusion that anything I say can't be seen anywhere.
[01:12.200 --> 01:17.700]  No, they said that I was banned off of YouTube two years ago, myself from having an account.
[01:17.700 --> 01:23.400]  But certainly I can go have a press conference at the Capitol and have 50 news cameras there and speak and be heard.
[01:23.400 --> 01:30.400]  But they're trying to set the precedent with yours truly to say no, certain people, no one is allowed to interview,
[01:30.400 --> 01:33.900]  no one is allowed to promote, no one is allowed to push.
[01:33.900 --> 01:40.500]  And again, you'll see these headlines every few days that are pushed on the ticker, on Fox News, on CNN.
[01:40.500 --> 01:42.900]  It'll be some outrageous lie.
[01:42.900 --> 01:49.800]  Alex Jones' employee arrested for stalking families, never been an employee, have nothing to do with him, doesn't matter.
[01:49.800 --> 01:52.100]  They run that ticker and they talk about it.
[01:52.100 --> 01:54.900]  Where Alex Jones loses his lawsuit, didn't happen.
[01:54.900 --> 02:03.500]  That's because they are putting out the idea that we're losers, we're failures, and that if you support us, you're a loser and you're a failure.
[02:03.500 --> 02:12.700]  When our real identity is populism, our real identity is nationalism, our real identity is real Christianity and free market capitalism and success.
[02:12.700 --> 02:20.200]  And that we successfully galvanize and energize the grassroots to get Trump elected and that we've turned the tide against the New World Order.
[02:20.200 --> 02:27.100]  So they have to demonize me and turn me into a pariah by convincing you that I'm a loser and I'm bad.
[02:27.100 --> 02:30.100]  I know as an audience, you understand that's a fraud.
[02:30.100 --> 02:39.000]  But if they're able to demonize info wars and steal our identity and basically sell the idea that we're somebody else, they could win in the end.
[02:39.000 --> 02:41.000]  And this model can be used against everybody.
[02:41.000 --> 02:45.900]  Because once they've shut us down, they can then speak in our voices.
[02:45.900 --> 02:52.900]  Say we said things we never said like saying Trump says all Mexicans are criminals and horrible people offer a million dollars.
[02:52.900 --> 02:54.800]  No one can find that video.
[02:54.800 --> 02:55.700]  Same time.
[02:55.700 --> 02:59.600]  I've offered a million dollars for people to find stuff where I said there's Marxist slave colonies.
[02:59.600 --> 03:00.600]  Never said it.
[03:00.600 --> 03:04.300]  But this is what they're doing to assassinate people's character.
[03:04.300 --> 03:11.400]  Now, shifting years to the coronavirus coming up in the second hour today, Dr.
[03:11.400 --> 03:13.400]  Francis Boyle, the author of the U.S.
[03:13.400 --> 03:23.500]  Biological Weapons Convention will be joining Owen Shroyer live to break down the fact that there's massive evidence and that he says the U.N.
[03:23.500 --> 03:29.200]  knows the WHO knows that this is a man made bio weapon.
[03:29.200 --> 03:38.000]  And now we've got the footage coming out of women being shot in the head at Chinese checkpoints, police locking potential coronavirus victims in their own homes,
[03:38.000 --> 03:44.900]  the drones flying around, surveilling people, using the robots during a plague to go out and control the humans.
[03:44.900 --> 03:50.600]  This is definitely a giant global beta test for control and scientific tyranny.
[03:50.600 --> 03:54.200]  But more and more, it's mounting that's an escaped bio weapon.
[03:54.200 --> 03:59.200]  And so we're going to be laying all this out coming up in the second hour.
[03:59.200 --> 04:07.000]  But when we come back, I want to get into some of Trump's state of the union last night and the bizarre behavior of Nancy Pelosi.
[04:17.400 --> 04:23.000]  We know that 2020 is an insane year already, and it's critical to keep him for us on the air.
[04:23.000 --> 04:31.000]  So when you purchase things like high quality, horrible food, you and your family need and get great products like our immune gargle and our silver infused
[04:31.000 --> 04:36.600]  and nano silver infused toothpaste, that's things you need that make you and your families lives better and safer.
[04:36.600 --> 04:38.900]  And it funds the info or a 360 win.
[04:38.900 --> 04:42.700]  So take advantage and get the immune gargle and other products before they sell out.
[04:42.700 --> 04:46.800]  They will be selling out by the end of the week info or store dot com.
[04:46.800 --> 04:58.800]  We'll be back.
[04:58.800 --> 05:08.800]  It is I, the leader of Cobra here for a message to President Trump, the American people and Alex Jones of info wars.
[05:08.800 --> 05:14.800]  Our operation to our partners, the communist Chinese have bought control of your media.
[05:14.800 --> 05:19.800]  But it's true, your people are beginning to awaken.
[05:19.800 --> 05:30.800]  That's why Cobra is launching operations to trigger race war, mass shootings and bombings which will be blamed on those loyal to America.
[05:30.800 --> 05:35.800]  Anyone wants to stage these attacks, they're just not blaming on Trump.
[05:35.800 --> 05:39.800]  We'll also be targeted by Cobra in the future.
[05:39.800 --> 05:54.800]  You see, when you expose our false flags and fake media, I will carry out attacks and then blame you like we've done with Alex Jones blaming him for mass shootings.
[05:54.800 --> 05:56.800]  We committed.
[05:56.800 --> 06:03.800]  Hey, Cobra.
[06:03.800 --> 06:11.800]  Defending the Republic from enemies, foreign and domestic. It's Alex Jones.
[06:11.800 --> 06:25.800]  Thank you. God bless you and God bless America. Thank you very much.
[06:25.800 --> 06:49.800]  A stunning moment here at the end of the president's speech, Nancy Pelosi tearing up what appeared to be a copy of the president's speech.
[06:49.800 --> 06:55.800]  It is Wednesday, February 5th, 2020. I'm your host Alex Jones.
[06:55.800 --> 07:03.800]  Coming up on Troyer will be taking over and we also have a very special guest that is going to be joining us.
[07:03.800 --> 07:13.800]  He is the individual that wrote the US biological weapons convention that was then welded into the United Nations treaty and made into law.
[07:13.800 --> 07:20.800]  And he is on the record saying that the UN officials and others know that this coronavirus is a man made bio weapon.
[07:20.800 --> 07:29.800]  This is a big deal. We don't have major labs saying it. We have other major organizations coming out and releasing the information that it is engineered.
[07:29.800 --> 07:33.800]  And this is just so huge, so huge that this information is being suppressed.
[07:33.800 --> 07:43.800]  So that's coming up today. But starting the broadcast here is obviously Nancy Pelosi showing the mental illness, showing the disconnect,
[07:43.800 --> 07:49.800]  showing just how removed from reality they're dying political party the Democrats are.
[07:49.800 --> 07:58.800]  She's up there ripping up the speech after Trump is done wearing a white dress so that she stands out.
[07:58.800 --> 08:07.800]  And it's the focal point of everything with all the Democrat women out there in their own little white outfits trying to create the illusion of solidarity with women against Republicans
[08:07.800 --> 08:16.800]  when a lot of those women out there are Islamists who openly believe that women should be genetically mutilated and shouldn't be allowed to drive cars.
[08:16.800 --> 08:24.800]  It's just crazy to watch the Democrats who tell us that MS-13 are all God's children tell us that again they speak for women, they speak for minorities.
[08:24.800 --> 08:35.800]  It's truly, truly sickening to watch their race-pating. But let's watch a clip of that one more time of her tearing up the speech right as Trump finishes it.
[08:35.800 --> 08:40.800]  Because that's the message she's sending is you're never going to get this agenda done.
[08:40.800 --> 08:45.800]  Thank you. God bless you. And God bless America. Thank you very much.
[08:45.800 --> 09:11.800]  A stunning moment here at the end of the president's speech Nancy Pelosi tearing up what appeared to be a copy of the president's speech.
[09:11.800 --> 09:21.800]  Expanding on this, we also see Pelosi not even clapping when Trump talks about helping children and things like that.
[09:21.800 --> 09:30.800]  Because they cannot humanize Trump in any way to their supporters who are only in a few blue dots in the United States.
[09:30.800 --> 09:35.800]  And why are they only in a few geographic areas of the United States of the Democrats?
[09:35.800 --> 09:44.800]  That's because I've done a big study of it and we've documented it extensively as you know. The Democrats have not been really getting popular elected for decades in this country.
[09:44.800 --> 09:51.800]  But in every city they control there's total absolute complete election fraud going on.
[09:51.800 --> 09:55.800]  And so they know that the whole country and the whole world is turning against them.
[09:55.800 --> 10:01.800]  Labor just lost over 50 plus points in the UK, a political realignment.
[10:01.800 --> 10:08.800]  So they are the Communist Party in Britain basically. They've been driven from power and their party probably crippled forever.
[10:08.800 --> 10:14.800]  They'll probably never come back. It's the same thing across the world people understand that socialism and communism is horrible.
[10:14.800 --> 10:26.800]  So the globalists are trying to accelerate their plan and crash the economy ahead of that so they can say that capitalism has failed and then offer us the Venezuelan model which they will control.
[10:26.800 --> 10:38.800]  Now I want to go ahead and end this segment with a clip of President Trump rubbing it in their faces when he gave the freedom medal to Rush Limbaugh during the State of the Union.
[10:38.800 --> 10:45.800]  This is someone that's been demonized, someone that's been lied about, someone that's got late stage cancer that he just announced a few days ago.
[10:45.800 --> 10:53.800]  And again Trump doing what's politically incorrect breaks the back of the establishment Hollywood that tells us what we can think and what we can do.
[10:53.800 --> 11:04.800]  Is Limbaugh perfect? No. He's come a long way. His show sounds like the Alex Jones show. Trump sounds like the Alex Jones show because we're just promoting real Americana and how the world really works.
[11:04.800 --> 11:18.800]  A corporate private world government that's anti-American that believes we are their slaves. So here is Trump historically giving the freedom medal to Rush Limbaugh via the hands of Melania Trump.
[11:18.800 --> 11:29.800]  Almost every American family knows the pain when a loved one is diagnosed with a serious illness. Here tonight is a special man,
[11:29.800 --> 11:38.800]  beloved by millions of Americans who just received a stage 4 advanced cancer diagnosis.
[11:38.800 --> 11:48.800]  This is not good news, but what is good news is that he is the greatest fighter and winner that you will ever meet.
[11:48.800 --> 12:12.800]  Limbaugh, thank you for your decades of tireless devotion to our country.
[12:18.800 --> 12:38.800]  And Rush, in recognition of all that you have done for our nation, the millions of people a day that you speak to and that you inspire and all of the incredible work that you have done for charity,
[12:38.800 --> 12:48.800]  I am proud to announce tonight that you will be receiving our country's highest civilian honor, the Presidential Medal of Freedom.
[13:08.800 --> 13:34.800]  I will now ask the First Lady of the United States to present you with the honor, please.
[13:34.800 --> 13:46.800]  Thank you Rush.
[13:46.800 --> 14:14.800]  Thank you Rush.
[14:14.800 --> 14:40.800]  Thank you Rush.
[14:40.800 --> 14:52.800]  Rush and Catherine, congratulations. Thank you Catherine.
[14:52.800 --> 15:15.800]  Ladies and gentlemen, the brevity of that moment I think will be missed by the average American. But for President Trump to award Rush Limbaugh with that medal of freedom last night was so beyond huge.
[15:15.800 --> 15:30.800]  It was really a breakneck point for the Democrat Party and the leftist hate group that currently occupies our country.
[15:30.800 --> 15:55.800]  And I don't know about you, but last night at that moment I cried like a little baby. Because for the President to say be damned to all the leftist haters that are going to lie about Rush Limbaugh and slander this great moment and to do that anyway was just so classy and so impeccable in its timing.
[15:55.800 --> 16:15.800]  I just can't say enough about it.
[16:15.800 --> 16:26.800]  Don't wait another day. There's no such thing as a hopeless tax case. Call 800-34-no-tax or go to my website, danpilla.com, that's danpilla.com, danpilla.com.

[19:23.800 --> 19:30.800]  My friends, I harp and harp and harp about iodine because it's the good halogen, fluoride's the bad halogen.
[19:30.800 --> 19:38.800]  And people told me about it for years and I didn't listen and I'm so thankful that finally I listened to Dr. Grip like eight years ago.
[19:38.800 --> 19:48.800]  It started taking true iodine, atomic iodine. We've got it back in StockX2, 40% off right now at infowarsstore.com.

[19:55.800 --> 20:09.800]  You can't lose unless you don't take action.
[20:25.800 --> 20:54.800]  Ladies and gentlemen, it's very rare that I am at a loss for words.
[20:54.800 --> 21:03.800]  And it's not that I'm at a loss for words because I'm so stunned by the landscape of news.
[21:03.800 --> 21:21.800]  But honestly, I'm still reeling here today in a good way, still in shock and awe in a good way from last night's State of the Union from President Trump.
[21:21.800 --> 21:31.800]  I laughed, I cried, I had moments of feeling inspired.
[21:31.800 --> 21:42.800]  I had chills. The hairs on the back of my neck and my arm stood up.
[21:42.800 --> 22:08.800]  And it was so powerful and such a home run that I'm still sitting here today kind of soaking it in, measuring it, measuring my emotions and seeing how America is responding.
[22:08.800 --> 22:28.800]  And America has responded. And it's very telling even the response we've had in the short term since the State of the Union last night, who the people are that have hate in their hearts.
[22:28.800 --> 22:48.800]  And I could be specific and we can name names and we know who it is and we could be specific and point out where that hatred is aimed and where it derives from, but it's almost a day to forget about that.
[22:48.800 --> 23:04.800]  It's almost a day to finally just put that hate aside, knowing it's there, but no longer wasting our energy with it, wasting our time with it, being concerned about it.
[23:04.800 --> 23:31.800]  And it's a time to look at the positive, look at the prosperity and look at the significance of what that State of the Union speech meant for the United States of America and for the world.
[23:31.800 --> 23:43.800]  And I'm not kidding you, I cried like a little baby when Rush Limbaugh received the Medal of Freedom.
[23:43.800 --> 24:05.800]  And that's because, yes, not only is Rush Limbaugh a major influence and inspiration for me, not only has Rush Limbaugh been a true American hero with all the lives that he's touched and his courageous endeavors and trailblazing in media.
[24:05.800 --> 24:23.800]  But more than anything, the class of President Donald Trump to just say, I'm going to do what's right here, even though I know there's going to be voices telling me not to.
[24:23.800 --> 24:36.800]  I know there's going to be people trying to slander and smear this beautiful moment and this American icon.
[24:36.800 --> 24:54.800]  And for President Trump to do that last night and then actually put the award by Melania Trump on to Rush Limbaugh. It was a tidal wave of patriotism.
[24:54.800 --> 25:07.800]  It was a tidal wave of doing what's right, saying haters be damned.
[25:07.800 --> 25:18.800]  And so with everything happening really just this week alone, culminated in that moment.
[25:18.800 --> 25:28.800]  It was just a moment for Americans to stand together and again and laugh and cry and toast and celebrate.
[25:28.800 --> 25:35.800]  And yeah, we saw the outliers pouting and whining and complaining.
[25:35.800 --> 25:49.800]  And we just ignored them and said, you know what, if you don't want to be a part of this, that's on you.
[25:49.800 --> 26:06.800]  And if you're going to live in such a state of hatred and denial and classlessness and dishonesty and disingenuousness, then that's on you.
[26:06.800 --> 26:27.800]  And for me, I do sometimes get bogged down by that because we cover it here on air and we respond to it, we point it out and we use it as an example of just the hatred and vitriol and the vile nature of the modern day left and Democrat Party.
[26:27.800 --> 26:33.800]  But that's not what that was about.
[26:33.800 --> 26:43.800]  And for me personally, I have kind of a social gauge, if you will, you know, friends and family obviously know I'm in media and do commentary.
[26:43.800 --> 26:58.800]  And so when I have people responding to events or messaging me about events, that kind of gives me an idea of the scale of social interest and the cultural impact of certain events.
[26:58.800 --> 27:04.800]  And last night was one of those moments where the scales were jumping.
[27:04.800 --> 27:14.800]  And I have liberal friends that were texting me saying, wow, what a speech from President Trump.
[27:14.800 --> 27:30.800]  I had neutral friends and family that usually don't understand why I have so much disgust towards Nancy Pelosi, these Democrats messaging me saying, wow, I see it now. I see what you've been talking about.
[27:30.800 --> 27:46.800]  And there's proof that this is happening with callers calling in to C-SPAN saying I am just appalled at the behavior of Nancy Pelosi and the Democrats last night.
[27:46.800 --> 28:06.800]  But again, we're toasting, we're celebrating, we're crying, we're laughing, we're smiling, we're inspiring, we're growing, we're building, we're learning, and we're doing it all together.
[28:06.800 --> 28:17.800]  And we're just on this day deciding to leave the haters behind, leave the losers behind.
[28:17.800 --> 28:29.800]  They've been extended an olive branch, they've been extended a hand, they've been offered to come on board and celebrate with us, and they're just not interested.
[28:29.800 --> 28:37.800]  And so this was a major turning point for America last night at the State of the Union Address.
[28:37.800 --> 28:44.800]  And we will move forward and continue to have victories and continue to celebrate America.
[28:44.800 --> 28:57.800]  And those voices of hate and those voices of deception against America are being drowned out, are being ignored, and being put where they belong in the trash.
[28:57.800 --> 29:06.800]  Heart disease is on the rise, clogged arteries, high blood pressure, and high cholesterol levels may not be fully detected by you, but the symptoms are there.

[32:08.480 --> 32:12.240]  want them off your back and off your children's back, and you know what, I'm the same way
[32:12.240 --> 32:16.720]  and that's why we're on the same damn team, and it's why Infowars has been delivering
[32:16.720 --> 32:23.200]  time and time again when it's clutch time to focus the people on taking action against

[32:33.560 --> 32:37.480]  thank you for committing to stand with us in 2020 however you can.
[32:37.480 --> 32:41.760]  For the bottom of my heart, for my family, and for the great crew at Infowars, I want
[32:41.760 --> 32:45.880]  to thank you all because you are the Infowar and you know that's not just words, that's
[32:45.880 --> 32:47.640]  reality.
[32:47.640 --> 32:49.240]  You have made history.
[32:49.240 --> 32:51.160]  We have made history together.
[32:51.160 --> 33:01.440]  Infowars.com only has power because of you and I suggest you use it.
[33:01.440 --> 33:19.400]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[33:19.400 --> 33:39.000]  It's kind of like if your team wins a sports championship or like the chief just won the
[33:39.000 --> 33:43.280]  Super Bowl and you're a chief's fan, it's like you're not sitting here talking about
[33:43.280 --> 33:49.080]  last week's game or what's happening in the off season or you know, Monday morning quarterbacking.
[33:49.080 --> 33:58.960]  You're just soaking it in, celebrating, enjoying it, having the feel goods and I don't know.
[33:58.960 --> 34:04.560]  I got all this news to get to and I got other stuff and I'm going to play these clips but
[34:04.560 --> 34:11.120]  I just feel like America just won the Super Bowl.
[34:11.120 --> 34:19.760]  I just feel like we deserve a day to just really just celebrate and reflect on what we
[34:19.760 --> 34:21.960]  witnessed last night.
[34:21.960 --> 34:25.800]  And yeah, the losers lost big league, didn't they?
[34:25.800 --> 34:29.720]  They lost big time and they're still sulking.
[34:29.720 --> 34:38.920]  But I mean, can you imagine, let's use the Super Bowl as an analogy.
[34:38.920 --> 34:43.680]  Can you imagine if after the 49ers lost the Super Bowl, they decided to start throwing
[34:43.680 --> 34:49.760]  things and throwing tantrums and fighting with people and fans and players and moping
[34:49.760 --> 34:50.760]  around.
[34:50.760 --> 34:52.640]  Can you imagine if that happened?
[34:52.640 --> 34:56.920]  That's what the Democrats are today.
[34:56.920 --> 35:06.440]  And they have such little self-awareness that they can't even see how ugly they are.
[35:06.440 --> 35:12.160]  They can't even see how their hatred is just oozing out of them and how turned off and
[35:12.160 --> 35:16.320]  disgusted America is by it.
[35:16.320 --> 35:22.100]  And I see this tweet from Rashida Tlaib who is really one of the most vile, disgusting
[35:22.100 --> 35:23.600]  members of Congress.
[35:23.600 --> 35:24.600]  This pig.
[35:24.600 --> 35:26.760]  I mean, she should get credit.
[35:26.760 --> 35:29.800]  I mean, it's the first pig to be elected to Congress.
[35:29.800 --> 35:36.840]  But it really explains everything to me, she says, I walked out of that speech as if it's
[35:36.840 --> 35:38.840]  all about her.
[35:38.840 --> 35:42.680]  Forget about the Tuskegee Airmen and his grandchild.
[35:42.680 --> 35:45.120]  Forget about the kid that gets school choice.
[35:45.120 --> 35:49.360]  Forget about the cancer patient who's inspired millions of people.
[35:49.360 --> 35:51.360]  No, it's all about her.
[35:51.360 --> 35:58.200]  She wanted you to know it's all about her because she is a pig.
[35:58.200 --> 36:07.480]  And she says the lies, the bigotry, literally celebrating everyone in America.
[36:07.480 --> 36:12.840]  And she says the shameless bragging about taking away food stamps that people depend
[36:12.840 --> 36:13.840]  on living.
[36:13.840 --> 36:17.520]  No, that is so out of touch with reality.
[36:17.520 --> 36:21.400]  It just shows you the very makeup of an average Democrat.
[36:21.400 --> 36:23.880]  They want you dependent.
[36:23.880 --> 36:26.960]  They celebrate you being desperate and dependent.
[36:26.960 --> 36:32.240]  They want you poor and they want you dependent on them.
[36:32.240 --> 36:33.880]  They're ticked.
[36:33.880 --> 36:39.600]  They're ticked that President Trump has uplifted this country and this economy and people to
[36:39.600 --> 36:44.920]  such an extent they don't need the fat of the government.
[36:44.920 --> 36:51.200]  They don't need to depend on someone else to take care of them.
[36:51.200 --> 36:52.640]  They're independent.
[36:52.640 --> 36:59.960]  They're making a live for themselves and the Democrats hate it.
[36:59.960 --> 37:04.320]  And that was put on display last night.
[37:04.320 --> 37:12.040]  Total classlessness from the Democrats and just total distinct class to the utmost from
[37:12.040 --> 37:21.880]  President Trump and from Americans that support him last night.
[37:21.880 --> 37:33.880]  But please, Democrats continue to make it all about you and continue to put your disgust
[37:33.880 --> 37:37.640]  on display.
[37:37.640 --> 37:41.400]  You are the worst of us.
[37:41.400 --> 37:45.560]  And we're leaving you in the dust now.
[37:45.560 --> 37:52.240]  And one good barometer of where America stands is the Washington Journal that takes place
[37:52.240 --> 38:01.120]  on C-SPAN every day where callers can call in and weigh in on topics and current events.
[38:01.120 --> 38:08.440]  And this morning on C-SPAN, and by the way, I will also say this before I go to the clip.
[38:08.440 --> 38:16.080]  I was going through all the different pre coverage and post coverage of the State of
[38:16.080 --> 38:21.480]  the Union, ABC, CBS, NBC, Washington Post, everything.
[38:21.480 --> 38:32.360]  And I was delighted, surprised, but very delighted in the fact that the average pundit covering
[38:32.360 --> 38:37.120]  this on all the mainstream news was honest about what happened.
[38:37.120 --> 38:39.320]  Trump was incredible.
[38:39.320 --> 38:44.560]  This was a beautiful night for America.
[38:44.560 --> 38:49.160]  And they were even people you can tell that didn't want to admit it, had to admit, wow,
[38:49.160 --> 38:53.360]  Trump knocked this out of the park and for the Democrats to go against this is about
[38:53.360 --> 38:57.040]  so out of touch that even they can't give them credit for it.
[38:57.040 --> 39:00.640]  Even they can't say that this is a win.
[39:00.640 --> 39:03.480]  They can't spin it, folks.
[39:03.480 --> 39:13.560]  And so here is a compilation, here is a compilation from C-SPAN today of people responding to
[39:13.560 --> 39:21.440]  the pathetic, immature, disgusting behavior of Nancy Pelosi last night during the State
[39:21.440 --> 39:22.440]  of the Union.
[39:22.440 --> 39:25.240]  I've been a Democrat for 70-something years.
[39:25.240 --> 39:30.720]  And what I've seen tonight of the Democrat Party, I am changing my mind.
[39:30.720 --> 39:34.760]  I mean, I'll probably still be a Democrat, but far around we're looking for a goddamn
[39:34.760 --> 39:36.160]  Democrat never again.
[39:36.160 --> 39:40.880]  I am a Democrat as well, but no longer will I vote Democrat.
[39:40.880 --> 39:46.000]  I think it's outrageous that they sat there when all these good things are happening to
[39:46.000 --> 39:49.600]  our country and how much we love our country.
[39:49.600 --> 39:52.160]  And they looked like they hated our country.
[39:52.160 --> 39:57.480]  And Nancy Pelosi, the whole time she's sitting up there with a disgusting look on her face,
[39:57.480 --> 39:58.640]  it's outrageous.
[39:58.640 --> 40:01.480]  I will never vote Democrat again.
[40:01.480 --> 40:02.640]  And I'm sick of it.
[40:02.640 --> 40:05.080]  And my whole family feels the same way.
[40:05.080 --> 40:10.760]  My husband, my friends are sitting here, all former Democrats, we all voted for Hillary
[40:10.760 --> 40:17.440]  last time, and therefore never, ever will we ever vote Democrat again.
[40:17.440 --> 40:21.560]  You know, it's always portrayed that the Democrats don't love their country, well, we love our
[40:21.560 --> 40:27.280]  country and we want to see it succeed, but it appears to us that our Democratic Party
[40:27.280 --> 40:35.480]  has been stolen from us by a bunch of communists, and no longer will our family ever vote Democrat
[40:35.480 --> 40:36.480]  again.
[40:36.480 --> 40:42.720]  I am literally disgusted with Pelosi and the Democrats' behavior, the way she teared up
[40:42.720 --> 40:46.000]  the speech behind him at the end.
[40:46.000 --> 40:51.400]  I was a registered Democrat, I have gone independent, I'm leaning GOP now.
[40:51.400 --> 41:00.080]  It's a simple rip of a paper, Nancy Pelosi has pretty much sealed the deal of a reelection
[41:00.080 --> 41:01.080]  of Donald Trump.
[41:01.080 --> 41:05.600]  Ladies and gentlemen, it was happening all last night in response.
[41:05.600 --> 41:08.920]  It was happening all this morning in response.
[41:08.920 --> 41:14.680]  And like I said, I kind of get a gauge on things just based on friends and family that
[41:14.680 --> 41:22.360]  respond to me and send me messages, and it was just overwhelming, disgust towards Nancy
[41:22.360 --> 41:30.280]  Pelosi and overwhelming joy in the speech from Donald Trump.
[41:30.280 --> 41:34.240]  And I'm talking about liberal friends, I'm talking about neutral family members, I'm
[41:34.240 --> 41:38.680]  talking about people that normally say, hey, you know, I don't really understand why you
[41:38.680 --> 41:43.240]  don't like these people so much, hey, I don't understand why you're so extreme in your rhetoric
[41:43.240 --> 41:50.360]  against these people, not apologizing for me, but basically saying, wow, I see it now,
[41:50.360 --> 41:54.840]  I understand it now.
[41:54.840 --> 41:58.520]  And you know what the incredible thing is?
[41:58.520 --> 42:03.560]  Nancy Pelosi and the Democrats are only going to get worse.
[42:03.560 --> 42:08.640]  They have no self-awareness, they are totally out of touch with reality, they're so arrogant
[42:08.640 --> 42:15.440]  and selfish in their nature that they're only going to get worse, folks.
[42:15.440 --> 42:25.000]  And for them to make this about them, for them to think they are bigger than the country,
[42:25.000 --> 42:29.560]  it's a major turnoff for the average American.
[42:29.560 --> 42:33.560]  And the only thing at this point that I can see that can be a bigger victory than that
[42:33.560 --> 42:42.800]  speech last night is President Donald Trump getting reelected with 100 million votes.
[42:42.800 --> 42:48.720]  And if the Democrats keep this up, he will be.
[42:48.720 --> 42:53.160]  And the only thing they can do is cheat, lie, and steal.
[42:53.160 --> 42:56.360]  That's all they have, folks, the hatred isn't working.
[42:56.360 --> 43:02.800]  Well, it's here, the year 2020, world governments out in the open, we've got the predicted mass
[43:02.800 --> 43:07.640]  pandemics and they're calling for global government as the answer, and we've got massive, huge
[43:07.640 --> 43:12.680]  censorship taking place that's coordinated by big tech and banks against people that
[43:12.680 --> 43:19.640]  promote America and guns and freedom and Jesus and the family and the protection of the unborn.
[43:19.640 --> 43:20.640]  Wow.
[43:20.640 --> 43:24.720]  Yes, now we know we're right, the new world order is real, Satanism is real, the pedophile
[43:24.720 --> 43:28.800]  elite are real, but we're real as well and we love God and we're standing up and saying
[43:28.800 --> 43:29.800]  no.
[43:29.800 --> 43:33.360]  But I just want to make the point here, one month into 2020, that we have never been in
[43:33.360 --> 43:34.360]  Kansas.
[43:34.360 --> 43:38.160]  We have never been in some small, ill place that didn't matter.
[43:38.160 --> 43:43.000]  Everything we do, every decision we make governs the future of our species and everything
[43:43.000 --> 43:44.720]  we've gone through and everything we're going to go through.
[43:44.720 --> 43:48.040]  So it's an incredible town to be alive, and I want to thank you all for being aware and
[43:48.040 --> 43:53.320]  being involved, but just remember, your action now via prayer, word of mouth, and financial
[43:53.320 --> 43:58.160]  support of InfoWars.com is critical, so please take action.
[43:58.160 --> 44:04.120]  Alex Jones here reporting from the road on the incredibly dangerous developments concerning
[44:04.120 --> 44:05.120]  the coronavirus.
[44:05.120 --> 44:10.840]  It has now infected hundreds and hundreds of thousands of people, it has now spread across
[44:10.840 --> 44:15.920]  the entire planet, and of course we've now discovered that indeed it is man-made and
[44:15.920 --> 44:20.600]  engineered, we're covering it live all with our team at infowars.com for its last show
[44:20.600 --> 44:21.600]  and band.
[44:21.600 --> 44:28.400]  On top of that, we have the patented nano-silver that Congress A&M and Homeland Security have
[44:28.400 --> 44:34.080]  certified is able to take out the corona family viruses and SARS, that's what it comes out
[44:34.080 --> 44:35.080]  of.
[44:35.080 --> 44:39.360]  We have that at 40% off, despite the fact that it's selling out in three different sizes
[44:39.360 --> 44:45.240]  at infowarsstore.com, and that's what I'm using, what my family's using as a frontline
[44:45.240 --> 44:46.240]  defense.
[44:46.240 --> 44:51.320]  Nothing's perfect except prayer in God's intervention, and we hope that this thing isn't as bad as
[44:51.320 --> 44:56.720]  it looks, but definitely we know why governments are panicking right now because this is certainly
[44:56.720 --> 44:59.440]  a bizarre virus.
[44:59.440 --> 45:04.360]  There's a lot of phony garbage out there in the world, a lot of people that never deliver.
[45:04.360 --> 45:12.360]  Well, I'm here to tell you infowars has delivered in royal flush, in a handful of ace of spades
[45:12.360 --> 45:17.360]  because of God, because of the audience of activists, and because of the great team at
[45:17.360 --> 45:21.560]  infowars, and we are all a team, ladies and gentlemen.
[45:21.560 --> 45:26.280]  So right now, humanity's awakening, it's explosive, it's powerful, it's incredible,
[45:26.280 --> 45:30.680]  but there's major obstacles coming down the road, and the only way we can effectively
[45:30.680 --> 45:35.640]  fight the NWO and stay in the game, like infowars has to tip the spear, is your financial support,
[45:35.640 --> 45:41.960]  we make it really easy, at infowarsstore.com, but I am blowing through our backup money
[45:41.960 --> 45:46.120]  right now with our reporters doing triple the work they ever have, because they volunteered
[45:46.120 --> 45:51.080]  to do it, and Owen and the rest of the crew will fight 18 hours a day, 7 days a week during
[45:51.080 --> 45:55.120]  this election year that's so critical, but they need the financing to put them in the
[45:55.120 --> 45:56.120]  field.
[45:56.120 --> 46:00.000]  Go to infowarsstore.com and fight for your own future.
[46:00.000 --> 46:05.360]  The demand for food has not let up, we are selling record amounts of it, everybody else
[46:05.360 --> 46:09.560]  is basically already sold out, or they have a giant wait list.
[46:09.560 --> 46:14.440]  Our suppliers have it in-house, mistaken 7 to 10 days to deliver, because again, they
[46:14.440 --> 46:19.040]  have to package it, they're running 24 hours a day, but in a few days, they're telling
[46:19.040 --> 46:22.360]  me it may go to a longer wait if you haven't gotten your order in.
[46:22.360 --> 46:26.080]  So I wouldn't crash tonight, we wanted this virus to be peering out, we wanted it to just
[46:26.080 --> 46:30.920]  be hype, looks like it is really, really bad, and it is man-made, and so that's why we're
[46:30.920 --> 46:36.440]  seeing the huge freak out, so get your storable food at infowarsstore.com, that helps fund
[46:36.440 --> 46:41.080]  our operation, it's insurance, you can eat a total 360 win, again get your food and actually
[46:41.080 --> 46:46.360]  get it delivered at infowarsstore.com, get your order in, it's locked in, guaranteed
[46:46.360 --> 46:52.520]  7 to 10 days, infowarsstore.com, and regardless it funds the operation, we also have the immune
[46:52.520 --> 46:56.240]  gargle at 40% off, we are going to sell out of that, but I'm just keeping it at that sales
[46:56.240 --> 46:58.760]  price, infowarsstore.com.
[46:58.760 --> 47:26.920]  All right, I'm going to try to move on here, I just can't help, but I'm going to try to
[47:26.920 --> 47:33.960]  move on here, I just can't help, but I just want to soak in as much of that beautiful
[47:33.960 --> 47:40.240]  state of the union from last night, and just all the great moments, I really just want
[47:40.240 --> 47:47.200]  to play the entire thing, and I may do that after I'm joined by Francis Boyle, Dr. Francis
[47:47.200 --> 47:55.880]  Boyle, creator of the Bioweapons Act, is going to be joining me to discuss his very important
[47:55.880 --> 48:06.520]  groundbreaking take on the coronavirus, and that is going to be coming up at 12.30, and
[48:06.520 --> 48:13.600]  so perhaps after that, I'll just air the entire state of the union, again it's like watching
[48:13.600 --> 48:18.120]  your favorite team win the Super Bowl, it's like watching your favorite team win the World
[48:18.120 --> 48:25.280]  Series or Stanley Cup or National Championship, you just love to see it, but I do have some
[48:25.280 --> 48:36.360]  news to get to, and be sure to spread the links far and wide, infowars.com and band.video
[48:36.360 --> 48:44.320]  for when Professor Dr. Francis Boyle is going to be joining us on the coronavirus in the
[48:44.320 --> 48:52.000]  latest coming out of China, and what has been discovered of the coronavirus being man-made,
[48:52.000 --> 48:58.280]  what does that mean, he'll break it all down. I haven't even taken the time to plug here
[48:58.280 --> 49:08.640]  today all the great products at infowars.com, but you've seen recent headlines attacking
[49:08.640 --> 49:14.680]  us, you've seen that the left and the corrupt power structure of this country are doing
[49:14.680 --> 49:21.760]  everything to try to keep us off the air. The good news is they are helpless other than
[49:21.760 --> 49:29.360]  just the means they have of running mainstream media to attack us, running corrupt lawyers
[49:29.360 --> 49:35.120]  to attack us, running social media companies to try to censor us, they may have control
[49:35.120 --> 49:41.840]  over that, but they don't have control over you, and when you go to infowars.com and buy
[49:41.840 --> 49:47.040]  the supplements, buy the emergency food supplies, buy the air filters, buy the water filters,
[49:47.040 --> 49:55.080]  buy the t-shirts, the hats, and everything in between at infowars.com, that's you defeating
[49:55.080 --> 50:03.960]  the corrupt establishment, that's you defeating the anti-American powers that be, and that's
[50:03.960 --> 50:11.880]  you not just keeping info wars on air in the face of the attacks against us and the attempts
[50:11.880 --> 50:18.120]  to shut us down, but it's also making us bigger and stronger and more powerful, and so I can't
[50:18.120 --> 50:26.160]  salute you enough, can't thank you enough, but just remember to go to infowarsstore.com
[50:26.160 --> 50:32.440]  today. If you already have emergency food or you already have a water filter or an air
[50:32.440 --> 50:40.400]  filter, which I think are just necessities for your home, well go get the toothpaste,
[50:40.400 --> 50:45.800]  everybody rushes their teeth, everybody needs toothpaste, why not shop with the good guys
[50:45.800 --> 50:54.720]  at infowarsstore.com, and you'll love the toothpaste. The super blue toothpaste took
[50:54.720 --> 51:00.120]  the audience that shops at infowarsstore.com by storm, overwhelming support for that, then
[51:00.120 --> 51:04.480]  we outdid ourselves and came out with the super silver toothpaste, both great products
[51:04.480 --> 51:11.760]  at infowarsstore.com, and remember, you know, there is the coronavirus, but there's other
[51:11.760 --> 51:19.840]  viruses going around, there's other bugs, the only or the best way for you to prevent
[51:19.840 --> 51:27.680]  this and be preemptive and to make sure that should you do fall ill, you have an immune
[51:27.680 --> 51:34.880]  system built up to fight it, we've got products that do that, the immune gargle, 50% off,
[51:34.880 --> 51:42.160]  the colloidal silver products infused that we have at infowarsstore.com, this is how
[51:42.160 --> 51:46.360]  you can build up your immune system, ladies and gentlemen, super silver immune gargle
[51:46.360 --> 51:54.040]  is a great way, that is on sale at infowarsstore.com, we've got the fish oil, the selenium, I mean
[51:54.040 --> 52:02.920]  the list of supplements seemingly is never ending, all powerful, all get great reviews,
[52:02.920 --> 52:07.240]  we open up the phone lines, people call in, they can't help but just rave about how much
[52:07.240 --> 52:13.800]  they love the supplements, the t-shirts, the hats, it's all at infowarsstore.com, we thank
[52:13.800 --> 52:21.600]  you for keeping us on air, we cannot thank you enough, and there's all kinds of films
[52:21.600 --> 52:25.840]  that we have too that get banned everywhere that maybe new audience members aren't aware
[52:25.840 --> 52:35.400]  of that are just so powerful and impactful, DVDs and books at infowarsstore.com, and again,
[52:35.400 --> 52:40.440]  that's what makes everything we do here possible, okay, so again, coming up next hour, Francis
[52:40.440 --> 52:48.120]  Boyle, the leading expert on this man-made bio weapon that is the coronavirus, he'll
[52:48.120 --> 53:05.160]  be breaking that down coming up in the next hour, I'm not sure where I want to go here
[53:05.160 --> 53:13.360]  but I might as well just stick with the current momentum of the state of the union last night
[53:13.360 --> 53:21.000]  which has a backdrop, not just with the Democrats embarrassing themselves and putting their hatred
[53:21.000 --> 53:29.280]  and vitriol on display, which is a hatred and vitriol for you last night at the state
[53:29.280 --> 53:36.720]  of the union, but the backdrop is them rigging the Iowa caucus the night before, which is
[53:36.720 --> 53:42.240]  really incredible, the Democrats kind of used to do shadow rigging of their elections, kind
[53:42.240 --> 53:45.960]  of a little behind the scenes, I mean, if you have a watchful eye, you notice it, it's
[53:45.960 --> 53:51.000]  pretty obvious, you know, Bernie Sanders got screwed last time around, the Democrats
[53:51.000 --> 53:56.400]  are always engaged in nefarious activity, these are high criminals, but now it's reached
[53:56.400 --> 54:01.960]  a point where they just rig elections and rig caucuses and just rig everything, just
[54:01.960 --> 54:08.160]  wide open, just right there for you to see, just, you know, everybody be damned, hey,
[54:08.160 --> 54:12.000]  we're the Democrats, we lie, cheat and steal, that's what we do, you know, take it or leave
[54:12.000 --> 54:18.400]  it, we hate Trump and this is what they think is going to give them victory, it's really
[54:18.400 --> 54:22.560]  pathetic and in fact, it's so incredible.
[54:22.560 --> 54:29.240]  First of all, voter turnout way down, but I mean, I'm looking at the caucus results
[54:29.240 --> 54:34.120]  finally getting released and they're giving it the victory to Pete Buttigieg, even though
[54:34.120 --> 54:37.280]  Bernie Sanders got more votes.
[54:37.280 --> 54:44.280]  So I mean, it's like, can you imagine, it's like the Kansas city chiefs beat the 49ers
[54:44.280 --> 54:50.560]  24 to 20 and then the NFL comes out and says, well, we're going to give the Niners seven
[54:50.560 --> 54:52.720]  points and declare the Niners the victors.
[54:52.720 --> 54:57.520]  It's like, well, they didn't win, they didn't deserve the victory and they had less points,
[54:57.520 --> 55:03.320]  but okay, that's basically what the Democrats are doing for Pete Buttigieg, which I really
[55:03.320 --> 55:10.600]  don't understand, I guess they're just trying to test the waters and see maybe if Buttigieg
[55:10.600 --> 55:15.240]  has a chance to beat Trump, unfortunately, what they're learning is, I guess Democrats
[55:15.240 --> 55:22.440]  are homophobic because many people that submitted votes in the caucus for Buttigieg, when they
[55:22.440 --> 55:28.560]  found out he was married to a man wanted to change their vote.
[55:28.560 --> 55:33.640]  So they're in all kinds of shambles, ladies and gentlemen, and then after last night's
[55:33.640 --> 55:37.480]  display, it just goes downhill from there.
[55:37.480 --> 55:45.600]  But man, just what an absolute victory last night was just all the highlights, all the
[55:45.600 --> 55:47.080]  positive things.
[55:47.080 --> 55:53.920]  I mean, President Trump couldn't have done a better job of highlighting all the good
[55:53.920 --> 55:59.560]  things happening in America, making sure everybody felt touched, making sure everybody
[55:59.560 --> 56:10.480]  felt included, uplifting, inspiring, and you know, you'd sit there because the president's
[56:10.480 --> 56:17.560]  done this before and has stayed at the union, and you'd sit there and you'd say, if you're
[56:17.560 --> 56:26.080]  writing this speech, you're about to deliver it, I want everyone in America to feel included.
[56:26.080 --> 56:30.440]  I want everyone in America to feel inspired and uplifted.
[56:30.440 --> 56:34.000]  I want everyone in America to feel hope.
[56:34.000 --> 56:42.920]  I want everyone in America to feel positive energy and take that and use it as momentum
[56:42.920 --> 56:50.440]  to just do great things.
[56:50.440 --> 57:05.200]  And you can just assume at this point in doing so, you're going to anger Democrats.
[57:05.200 --> 57:12.760]  And think about how sad that is, that you could sit here and say, I'm going to give
[57:12.760 --> 57:22.320]  a speech that is going to be universally and objectively inspiring and uplifting.
[57:22.320 --> 57:30.680]  And I know in doing so, I'm going to anger Democrats in Congress, and this is going to
[57:30.680 --> 57:35.440]  be on display for America to see.
[57:35.440 --> 57:44.920]  And the sad thing about it is that's how predictable these Democrats have become, ladies and gentlemen.
[57:44.920 --> 57:47.760]  And when you're that filled with hate, it's pretty easy.
[57:47.760 --> 57:52.800]  We now know that more than 60 million people are on total lockdown in China, and the food
[57:52.800 --> 57:55.480]  supplies and medical supplies are running out.
[57:55.480 --> 58:00.060]  We know the virus has already spread to more than a dozen countries, and many Chinese who
[58:00.060 --> 58:04.920]  escaped Wuhan are now confirmed to be arriving on the United States West Coast.
[58:04.920 --> 58:09.440]  We've now confirmed from major food suppliers across the United States that they've already
[58:09.440 --> 58:14.200]  run out of supplies of affordable foods because of institutional and governmental buyers.
[58:14.200 --> 58:18.080]  That's right, the rich, the powerful, the elite, big corporations are now buying up
[58:18.080 --> 58:19.920]  food stores at alarming rates.
[58:19.920 --> 58:24.160]  Info wars, private labels from my patriot supply, and she gets right out of the very
[58:24.160 --> 58:25.600]  same factory.
[58:25.600 --> 58:29.240]  They called and let us know that they have bought food forward, but that's going to run
[58:29.240 --> 58:31.120]  out probably in a few weeks.
[58:31.120 --> 58:35.960]  And that people need to order now, they want to be able to get it within seven to 10 days.
[58:35.960 --> 58:43.360]  But if people wait, it may end up being longer, but if you get your order in now at infowarstore.com,
[58:43.360 --> 58:48.760]  you will be secured to get the food within seven to 10 days.

[1:00:05.480 --> 1:00:13.080]  You know, I apologize to the listeners today if I am sounding redundant or like I'm stuck
[1:00:13.080 --> 1:00:17.280]  in the mud here, but I just, I can't help it, folks.
[1:00:17.280 --> 1:00:21.800]  I mean, why would I not celebrate my team winning the Super Bowl?
[1:00:21.800 --> 1:00:24.520]  Why would I not celebrate America having total victory?
[1:00:24.520 --> 1:00:29.880]  Why would I not celebrate my family coming together and being inspired and uplifted and
[1:00:29.880 --> 1:00:32.880]  all of us?
[1:00:32.880 --> 1:00:37.360]  I mean, it's just where I stand today.
[1:00:37.360 --> 1:00:41.200]  It's just, that's where my spirit is.
[1:00:41.200 --> 1:00:45.320]  I don't want to get into negativity, even though it's the news.
[1:00:45.320 --> 1:00:48.200]  I mean, I've got all the stories here.
[1:00:48.200 --> 1:00:51.360]  I just can't bring myself to do it.
[1:00:51.360 --> 1:00:54.920]  And I know I need to, because that's my job here, and I'll, and I'll eventually break
[1:00:54.920 --> 1:00:55.920]  through this.
[1:00:55.920 --> 1:01:01.000]  But what I want to do, I've decided this.
[1:01:01.000 --> 1:01:02.000]  I've got a big interview.
[1:01:02.000 --> 1:01:08.100]  This is, I mean, this is like, you know, it's about as big as it gets right now when it
[1:01:08.100 --> 1:01:18.040]  comes to the coronavirus virus, Dr. Francis Boyle coming on to talk about the fact this
[1:01:18.040 --> 1:01:25.560]  is a man-made bio weapon, what that means, how we know it, and just his take on all of
[1:01:25.560 --> 1:01:31.920]  that with his expert opinion as the creator of the Bio Weapon Act, he's going to be joining
[1:01:31.920 --> 1:01:35.080]  us in 30 minutes here.
[1:01:35.080 --> 1:01:37.120]  So that's going to be key.
[1:01:37.120 --> 1:01:44.920]  But what I want to do in the third hour, and who has the fourth hour today, guys?
[1:01:44.920 --> 1:01:48.640]  Mike Adams, and he may want to do this as well, I won't speak for Mike.
[1:01:48.640 --> 1:01:53.520]  But in the third hour after Dr. Boyle leaves this, I'm going to open up the phone lines.
[1:01:53.520 --> 1:01:58.040]  I want to get your response to last night's day of the union and everything.
[1:01:58.040 --> 1:02:02.640]  I want to hear from the audience what you thought about it.
[1:02:02.640 --> 1:02:13.520]  And I mean, again, I just, I laughed, I cried, I stood up and cheered, you know, it was just,
[1:02:13.520 --> 1:02:18.120]  it was beyond all expectations for me.
[1:02:18.120 --> 1:02:24.680]  And I think that anybody listening to that that's not filled entirely their hearts with
[1:02:24.680 --> 1:02:31.920]  hate was inspired, was uplifted, and is celebratory today.
[1:02:31.920 --> 1:02:32.920]  And it really drew a line.
[1:02:32.920 --> 1:02:33.920]  Did it not?
[1:02:33.920 --> 1:02:37.680]  It really drew a demarcation line.
[1:02:37.680 --> 1:02:40.520]  I mean, heck, even there were, hey, you got to give credit.
[1:02:40.520 --> 1:02:44.160]  Some of these Democrats stood and cheered like Kristen Sinema.
[1:02:44.160 --> 1:02:46.040]  Good for her.
[1:02:46.040 --> 1:02:47.280]  She still has a heart.
[1:02:47.280 --> 1:02:48.560]  She still has a soul.
[1:02:48.560 --> 1:02:50.680]  She's still in touch with humanity.
[1:02:50.680 --> 1:02:52.760]  She's not filled with hate.
[1:02:52.760 --> 1:02:54.240]  She stood and cheered.
[1:02:54.240 --> 1:02:56.760]  She looked proud to do it.
[1:02:56.760 --> 1:03:00.400]  Sitting to her left was Kamala Harris, stowling like a demon.
[1:03:00.400 --> 1:03:03.600]  Sitting to her right was Kristen Gillibrand wondering, should I stand?
[1:03:03.600 --> 1:03:04.600]  Should I sit?
[1:03:04.600 --> 1:03:05.600]  I don't know.
[1:03:05.600 --> 1:03:08.720]  And she said, damn, be the haters.
[1:03:08.720 --> 1:03:10.680]  I'm proud of America.
[1:03:10.680 --> 1:03:15.680]  I will stand.
[1:03:15.680 --> 1:03:23.000]  So just just incredible, ladies and gentlemen, just incredible.
[1:03:23.000 --> 1:03:25.680]  There is other news to get to, though.
[1:03:25.680 --> 1:03:31.800]  And so I really need to just break through this kind of celebratory mood.
[1:03:31.800 --> 1:03:38.080]  I'm in this, this spirit that's overwhelming me and I'm going to do it in the next segment.
[1:03:38.080 --> 1:03:44.480]  I promise you, but just just for one last time, I just can't help but say this is just
[1:03:44.480 --> 1:03:48.480]  a tremendous victory for America last night.
[1:03:48.480 --> 1:03:52.680]  It was a tremendous victory for President Trump last night.
[1:03:52.680 --> 1:03:57.560]  Not that he intended it to be that way.
[1:03:57.560 --> 1:04:06.360]  But by proxy, the Democrats just could not help themselves, but put their hatred and
[1:04:06.360 --> 1:04:13.120]  vitriol for this country on display one more time for the national states for all to see.
[1:04:13.120 --> 1:04:15.600]  And by the way, I don't know.
[1:04:15.600 --> 1:04:18.520]  I haven't seen these numbers or anybody reporting on it.
[1:04:18.520 --> 1:04:25.600]  Maybe somebody has, but I can just tell you based on the numbers that I saw, because I
[1:04:25.600 --> 1:04:29.880]  was actually watching while I was at the gym and I was just on YouTube going through
[1:04:29.880 --> 1:04:35.720]  all the different streams, millions of people on YouTube alone tuned in.
[1:04:35.720 --> 1:04:40.960]  So that's not, you know, your cable programs or your television or C-span or anything.
[1:04:40.960 --> 1:04:46.600]  That's just on the internet, which is kind of a new medium for people to consume a state
[1:04:46.600 --> 1:04:47.600]  of the union address.
[1:04:47.600 --> 1:04:51.800]  So I mean, this was maybe the most watched state of the union of all time.
[1:04:51.800 --> 1:04:57.520]  And well, folks, you know what people saw and they're responding to it.
[1:04:57.520 --> 1:05:02.800]  It's amazing that we have the only patented nano silver that's been found by Homeland
[1:05:02.800 --> 1:05:08.160]  Security to take out SARS, which is the same family as the Corona virus.
[1:05:08.160 --> 1:05:11.280]  We have it in our super silver toothpaste.
[1:05:11.280 --> 1:05:13.040]  We have it in our super blue toothpaste.
[1:05:13.040 --> 1:05:16.320]  We have it in the immune gargle products.
[1:05:16.320 --> 1:05:20.200]  And of course, it's in the super silver wound gel that is sold nationally.
[1:05:20.200 --> 1:05:26.160]  We just private label it from the people that produce at the nanotech company out of Colorado.
[1:05:26.160 --> 1:05:32.480]  And we have a stockpile of it, but we've already sold half of the stockpile of it.
[1:05:32.480 --> 1:05:40.080]  I'm still offering the products at 40 to 50% off at infowarstore.com until they sell out,
[1:05:40.080 --> 1:05:44.520]  which most of these products are set to sell out within days or then about another week.
[1:05:44.520 --> 1:05:49.000]  So go to infowarstore.com to get your immune gargle, to get the toothpaste and to get the
[1:05:49.000 --> 1:05:50.720]  super silver wound gel.
[1:05:50.720 --> 1:05:54.600]  But the immune gargle is what is so important because you gargle with it and can also drink
[1:05:54.600 --> 1:06:00.280]  it infowarstore.com.
[1:06:00.280 --> 1:06:05.800]  From the front lines of the information war, it's Owen Troyer.
[1:06:05.800 --> 1:06:10.800]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[1:06:10.800 --> 1:06:18.360]  All right, here's what we're going to do, folks.
[1:06:18.360 --> 1:06:22.680]  I'm going to go to some of these highlights here of last night's stay the union before
[1:06:22.680 --> 1:06:23.840]  I move on to the other news.
[1:06:23.840 --> 1:06:26.680]  I just can't help myself.
[1:06:26.680 --> 1:06:31.800]  And so we're going to do that here in just a minute, but folks, infowarstore.com has
[1:06:31.800 --> 1:06:36.640]  the best emergency food supplies at the best price.
[1:06:36.640 --> 1:06:41.560]  And nobody wants to think about the worst happening, whether that's a devastating earthquake
[1:06:41.560 --> 1:06:46.680]  or a hurricane or a flood or like what we're seeing in China with the coronavirus.
[1:06:46.680 --> 1:06:52.280]  But should the worst happen, you don't want to be in a pinch where you're trying to figure
[1:06:52.280 --> 1:06:55.280]  out what am I going to do for food to feed my family.
[1:06:55.280 --> 1:06:58.520]  And then you get to the grocery store, you see the long lines.
[1:06:58.520 --> 1:07:02.520]  If you're lucky, you can even get in, but the shelves are empty.
[1:07:02.520 --> 1:07:06.120]  Do not be faced with that situation.

[1:07:19.000 --> 1:07:20.440]  happen.

[1:07:49.400 --> 1:07:50.400]  emergency food.

[1:07:52.960 --> 1:07:58.560]  Or if you want to get the whole, you know, list of options into an emergency food supply,
[1:07:58.560 --> 1:08:00.280]  that is available too.

[1:08:06.640 --> 1:08:08.440]  Okay.
[1:08:08.440 --> 1:08:10.880]  Let's go to these highlights now.
[1:08:10.880 --> 1:08:17.600]  These are some of the highlights from last night's State of the Union.
[1:08:17.600 --> 1:08:22.440]  Three years ago, we launched the Great American Comeback.
[1:08:22.440 --> 1:08:27.400]  Tonight I stand before you to share the incredible results.
[1:08:27.400 --> 1:08:35.640]  Jobs are booming, incomes are soaring, poverty is plummeting, crime is falling, confidence
[1:08:35.640 --> 1:08:53.440]  is surging, and our country is thriving and highly respected again.
[1:08:53.440 --> 1:09:01.720]  In just three short years, we have shattered the mentality of American decline, and we
[1:09:01.720 --> 1:09:07.760]  have rejected the downsizing of Americans' destiny.
[1:09:07.760 --> 1:09:12.080]  We have totally rejected the downsizing.
[1:09:12.080 --> 1:09:19.360]  We're moving forward at a pace that was unimaginable just a short time ago, and we are never, ever
[1:09:19.360 --> 1:09:31.120]  going back.
[1:09:31.120 --> 1:09:36.840]  Since my election, we have created 7 million new jobs, 5 million more than government experts
[1:09:36.840 --> 1:09:52.880]  projected during the previous administration.
[1:09:52.880 --> 1:10:02.600]  The unemployment rate is the lowest in over half a century, and very incredibly, the average
[1:10:02.600 --> 1:10:09.880]  unemployment rate under my administration is lower than any administration in the history
[1:10:09.880 --> 1:10:27.040]  of our country.
[1:10:27.040 --> 1:10:33.120]  If we hadn't reversed the failed economic policies of the previous administration, the
[1:10:33.120 --> 1:10:53.000]  world would not now be witnessing this great economic success.
[1:10:53.000 --> 1:10:59.440]  The unemployment rate for African Americans, Hispanic Americans, and Asian Americans has
[1:10:59.440 --> 1:11:15.400]  reached the lowest levels in history.
[1:11:15.400 --> 1:11:24.840]  African American youth unemployment has reached an all-time low.
[1:11:24.840 --> 1:11:35.040]  African American poverty has declined to the lowest rate ever recorded.
[1:11:35.040 --> 1:11:40.200]  The unemployment rate for women reached the lowest level in almost 70 years, and last
[1:11:40.200 --> 1:11:59.560]  year women filled 72 percent of all new jobs added.
[1:11:59.560 --> 1:12:11.600]  The veteran's unemployment rate dropped to a record low.
[1:12:11.600 --> 1:12:31.000]  The unemployment rate for disabled Americans has reached an all-time low.
[1:12:31.000 --> 1:12:36.560]  Workers without a high school diploma have achieved the lowest unemployment rate recorded
[1:12:36.560 --> 1:12:48.000]  in U.S. history.
[1:12:48.000 --> 1:12:57.200]  A record number of young Americans are now employed.
[1:12:57.200 --> 1:13:02.360]  Under the last administration, more than 10 million people were added to the food stamp
[1:13:02.360 --> 1:13:03.800]  rolls.
[1:13:03.800 --> 1:13:10.400]  Under my administration, 7 million Americans have come off food stamps, and 10 million people
[1:13:10.400 --> 1:13:39.400]  have been lifted off of welfare.
[1:13:39.400 --> 1:13:45.080]  In eight years under the last administration, over 300,000 working-age people dropped out
[1:13:45.080 --> 1:13:46.720]  of the workforce.
[1:13:46.720 --> 1:13:54.200]  In just three years of my administration, 3.5 million working-age people have joined
[1:13:54.200 --> 1:14:08.120]  the workforce.
[1:14:08.120 --> 1:14:14.280]  Since my election, the net worth of the bottom half of wage earners has increased by 47 percent
[1:14:14.280 --> 1:14:25.080]  three times faster than the increase for the top 1 percent.
[1:14:25.080 --> 1:14:31.200]  After decades of flat and falling incomes, wages are rising fast, and wonderfully, they
[1:14:31.200 --> 1:14:38.040]  are rising fastest for low-income workers who have seen a 16 percent pay increase since
[1:14:38.040 --> 1:14:54.400]  my election.
[1:14:54.400 --> 1:15:07.800]  This is a blue-collar boom.
[1:15:07.800 --> 1:15:13.200]  Our roaring economy has, for the first time ever, given many former prisoners the ability
[1:15:13.200 --> 1:15:17.400]  to get a great job and a fresh start.
[1:15:17.400 --> 1:15:22.200]  This second chance at life is made possible because we passed landmark criminal justice
[1:15:22.200 --> 1:15:24.720]  reform into law.
[1:15:24.720 --> 1:15:29.840]  Everybody said that criminal justice reform couldn't be done, but I got it done and the
[1:15:29.840 --> 1:15:33.120]  people in this room got it done.
[1:15:33.120 --> 1:15:36.640]  Some of the highlights there from last night's State of the Union, and you know, kind of
[1:15:36.640 --> 1:15:43.680]  an intangible, immeasurable that was highlighted in my mind last night, is President Trump
[1:15:43.680 --> 1:15:47.440]  has pretty much erased the Obama legacy.
[1:15:47.440 --> 1:15:51.240]  Obama's presidency, it's almost like it never happened.
[1:15:51.240 --> 1:15:56.200]  It's really incredible how the legacy of Obama is just gone, it's like it doesn't exist.
[1:15:56.200 --> 1:16:00.720]  Heart disease is on the rise, clogged arteries, high blood pressure, and high cholesterol
[1:16:00.720 --> 1:16:05.000]  levels may not be fully detected by you, but the symptoms are there.
[1:16:05.000 --> 1:16:09.760]  Loss of energy, blood sugar, spikes and drops, poor circulation, and irregular heartbeat
[1:16:09.760 --> 1:16:13.400]  are just a few of these that can alert you that something is wrong.
[1:16:13.400 --> 1:16:17.920]  Hear how heart and body extract is making a difference in thousands of people's lives
[1:16:17.920 --> 1:16:18.920]  across America.
[1:16:18.920 --> 1:16:22.840]  My blood pressure has normalized, my diabetes has totally improved.
[1:16:22.840 --> 1:16:26.480]  Everyone is telling me now how much healthier I look, and I'm telling everyone how much
[1:16:26.480 --> 1:16:27.480]  healthier I feel.
[1:16:27.480 --> 1:16:30.120]  I recommend heart and body extract to everyone.
[1:16:30.120 --> 1:16:35.280]  Anybody over 40 in the North American continent should be using this product as a preventative
[1:16:35.280 --> 1:16:37.800]  to keep their cardiovascular system healthy.
[1:16:37.800 --> 1:16:46.000]  Order your two month supply today by calling 866-295-5305, that's 866-295-5305 or order

[1:16:54.600 --> 1:16:59.240]  Finally, there's a way for you to get into the blockchain, the hottest financial sector
[1:16:59.240 --> 1:17:01.040]  without all the speculation.
[1:17:01.040 --> 1:17:06.280]  No, enjoy a 27% annualized payment each month without the ups and downs of Bitcoin.
[1:17:06.280 --> 1:17:10.640]  Seen on programs broadcast on Fox Business News, blockchain data centers offer an equipment
[1:17:10.640 --> 1:17:13.920]  leasing program in the explosive digital asset marketplace.
[1:17:13.920 --> 1:17:17.840]  Inspired by entrepreneurs who sold picks and shovels during the gold rush, the money is
[1:17:17.840 --> 1:17:21.920]  in the mining equipment used to manufacture dozens of critical digital assets.
[1:17:21.920 --> 1:17:26.480]  Not a security IPO or note, blockchain data centers have a proven turnkey equipment sale
[1:17:26.480 --> 1:17:32.520]  lease back program with a 27% annualized lease payment deposited into your bank account
[1:17:32.520 --> 1:17:33.520]  each month.
[1:17:33.520 --> 1:17:41.360]  Don't miss this one, stake your claim today, call 800-600-3388, that's 800-600-3388.
[1:17:41.360 --> 1:17:43.480]  These valuable lease contracts won't last long.
[1:17:43.480 --> 1:17:48.800]  Call now 800-600-3388, 800-600-3388.
[1:17:48.800 --> 1:17:51.240]  Equipment offer poses a financial risk to owners consult with financial professionals
[1:17:51.240 --> 1:17:52.240]  before purchasing.
[1:17:52.240 --> 1:17:57.560]  Not an offer to buy or sell a security which requires an offering document.
[1:17:57.560 --> 1:18:00.000]  The demand for food has not let up.
[1:18:00.000 --> 1:18:02.680]  We are selling record amounts of it.
[1:18:02.680 --> 1:18:07.120]  Everybody else is basically already sold out or they have giant wait list.
[1:18:07.120 --> 1:18:12.240]  Our suppliers have it in-house, mistaken 7 to 10 days to deliver because again they have
[1:18:12.240 --> 1:18:16.680]  to package it, they are running 24 hours a day, but in a few days they are telling me
[1:18:16.680 --> 1:18:19.880]  it may go to a longer wait if you haven't gotten your order yet.
[1:18:19.880 --> 1:18:23.640]  So I wouldn't procrastinate, we wanted this virus to be peering out, we wanted it to just
[1:18:23.640 --> 1:18:24.640]  be hype.
[1:18:24.640 --> 1:18:29.240]  Looks like it is really, really bad and it is man-made and so that's why we are seeing
[1:18:29.240 --> 1:18:30.240]  the huge freak out.
[1:18:30.240 --> 1:18:35.240]  So get your storeable food at infowarsupstore.com, that helps fund your operation, it's insurance,
[1:18:35.240 --> 1:18:42.160]  you can eat a total 360 win, again get your food and actually get it delivered at infowarsupstore.com,
[1:18:42.160 --> 1:18:47.960]  get your order in, it's locked in, guaranteed 7 to 10 days, infowarsupstore.com and regardless
[1:18:47.960 --> 1:18:52.160]  it funds the operation, we also have the immune gargle at 40% off, we are going to sell out
[1:18:52.160 --> 1:18:56.440]  of that but I'm just keeping it at that sales price infowarsupstore.com.
[1:18:56.440 --> 1:19:01.680]  Infowars life is bringing you a breakthrough in modern medicine, introducing pollen block.
[1:19:01.680 --> 1:19:06.880]  We have found an extraordinary new, natural way to alleviate seasonal distress symptoms
[1:19:06.880 --> 1:19:13.720]  including promoting clear nasal and sinus passageways, eye comfort and respiratory function.
[1:19:13.720 --> 1:19:19.580]  In the 1960s, researchers in France noticed that people who ate certain quail eggs experienced
[1:19:19.580 --> 1:19:22.920]  less seasonal immune and inflammatory responses.
[1:19:22.920 --> 1:19:27.840]  They began studying this effect in published trials and decades later we now have the fruit
[1:19:27.840 --> 1:19:34.200]  of this research, a fast-acting, chewable tablet that helps alleviate seasonal distress symptoms.
[1:19:34.200 --> 1:19:39.360]  Pollen block is natural and effective, it is not an antihistamine, in fact current research
[1:19:39.360 --> 1:19:44.200]  has found that it actually acts by blocking the activity of tryptase which is an enzyme
[1:19:44.200 --> 1:19:48.320]  that amplifies immune and inflammatory responses in the body.
[1:19:48.320 --> 1:19:53.560]  Go outside and enjoy the air you breathe, head to infowarsupstore.com and grab a pack
[1:19:53.560 --> 1:19:59.960]  of our pollen block chewable tablets.
[1:19:59.960 --> 1:20:18.360]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[1:20:18.360 --> 1:20:33.880]  I'm really not sure how to properly analyze it or measure it, but what is Obama's legacy
[1:20:33.880 --> 1:20:38.280]  now?
[1:20:38.280 --> 1:20:48.440]  Obama has pretty much just been erased as any form of a significant president at all
[1:20:48.440 --> 1:20:50.640]  by Donald Trump.
[1:20:50.640 --> 1:20:51.760]  He's a nothing now.
[1:20:51.760 --> 1:21:00.560]  Obama is a zero president, it's almost like he never was president.
[1:21:00.560 --> 1:21:07.920]  And I think that this is something that really upsets the left in the Democrat Party and
[1:21:07.920 --> 1:21:09.960]  they know it's true.
[1:21:09.960 --> 1:21:16.720]  Because now even they're being forced to throw Obama under the bus, Biden is extremely unpopular,
[1:21:16.720 --> 1:21:26.000]  they can't tout any success of the Obama administrations and so the Obama legacy is
[1:21:26.000 --> 1:21:32.360]  now basically a nothing burger president.
[1:21:32.360 --> 1:21:41.000]  Or it may get worse for Obama and the Democrats because well if we get justice for the illegal
[1:21:41.000 --> 1:21:50.760]  spying and for the basis of the Russian collusion narrative and investigation with the illegal
[1:21:50.760 --> 1:21:59.080]  spying, Obama's legacy won't be about what he did for America as president.
[1:21:59.080 --> 1:22:06.080]  It will be as a totally corrupt anti-American criminal who belongs in jail.
[1:22:06.080 --> 1:22:13.280]  And that's really the only chance or shot at a legacy Barack Obama now has.
[1:22:13.280 --> 1:22:22.400]  So Obama either goes down as a forgotten president or he goes down as a criminal trader
[1:22:22.400 --> 1:22:25.240]  against this republic.
[1:22:25.240 --> 1:22:34.880]  And that couldn't have been more eloquently nuanced into that speech last night by President
[1:22:34.880 --> 1:22:38.600]  Trump.
[1:22:38.600 --> 1:22:44.360]  Now coming up in the next segment I will switch gears and get into the latest in the coronavirus
[1:22:44.360 --> 1:22:52.000]  outbreak in China and then the expert Professor Francis Boyle will be joining me to talk about
[1:22:52.000 --> 1:23:01.720]  the evidence that this is a man made bio weapon and the significance of that and what it means
[1:23:01.720 --> 1:23:03.000]  that will be coming up next.
[1:23:03.000 --> 1:23:12.400]  But let me just really pile drive through these headlines before we get to that.
[1:23:12.400 --> 1:23:16.640]  Trump at the State of the Union the best is yet to come.
[1:23:16.640 --> 1:23:24.840]  Well if we get another four years of Trump as far as the economy is concerned and American
[1:23:24.840 --> 1:23:36.800]  pride and American exceptionalism is concerned, yes, the current trajectory that we're on
[1:23:36.800 --> 1:23:41.280]  is only going to go up.
[1:23:41.280 --> 1:23:45.040]  Trump completely ignores Pelosi's handshake attempt during State of the Union.
[1:23:45.040 --> 1:23:51.760]  Now this happened before the speech was given and this is how out of touch and how zero
[1:23:51.760 --> 1:23:54.240]  self-awareness Nancy Pelosi has.
[1:23:54.240 --> 1:24:01.200]  She could have actually used that moment and tried to use it against Trump but because
[1:24:01.200 --> 1:24:09.000]  she just couldn't help herself she ended up being the bad guy and Trump even gets a double
[1:24:09.000 --> 1:24:11.640]  victory on that deal.
[1:24:11.640 --> 1:24:16.160]  Melania Trump awards Rush Limbaugh Presidential Medal of Freedom at State of the Union just
[1:24:16.160 --> 1:24:20.280]  total class total victory for America.
[1:24:20.280 --> 1:24:27.760]  I cried like a baby the timing is impeccable the bravery the class for that to happen cannot
[1:24:27.760 --> 1:24:34.240]  be understated wow congratulations to Rush congratulations to America for that.
[1:24:34.240 --> 1:24:41.040]  And of course what makes it so powerful to me is the fact that we all knew the left would
[1:24:41.040 --> 1:24:47.200]  cry and whine and complain about this and President Trump did it anyway because it was
[1:24:47.200 --> 1:24:50.200]  the right thing to do.
[1:24:50.200 --> 1:24:53.960]  Pelosi does not applaud as Trump announces scholarship for fourth grade student.
[1:24:53.960 --> 1:24:59.080]  I mean you can go down the list of the things the Democrats sat for unemployment being low
[1:24:59.080 --> 1:25:05.640]  female unemployment being record lows just all different I mean every walk of life American
[1:25:05.640 --> 1:25:13.440]  unemployment record lows economic booms people winning all inspiring stuff the Democrats
[1:25:13.440 --> 1:25:19.160]  just don't get joy out of that they want a nation full of dependent the lapitated slaves
[1:25:19.160 --> 1:25:24.160]  that's why they cried when President Trump said we're getting people off of food stamps
[1:25:24.160 --> 1:25:30.840]  they they literally want people on food stamps folks really said Pelosi rips up Trump stay
[1:25:30.840 --> 1:25:37.680]  the union speech at the end for all to see I mean how do you measure that just just a
[1:25:37.680 --> 1:25:44.280]  woman who's filled with hatred vitriol and vodka AOC skipped the state of the union
[1:25:44.280 --> 1:25:49.000]  and then did her own little periscope just two once again highlight the arrogance of
[1:25:49.000 --> 1:25:57.480]  that clown just the total arrogance the selfishness it's all about her it's all about me Trump
[1:25:57.480 --> 1:26:02.520]  makes a state of the union all about America the Democrats can't help but make it all about
[1:26:02.520 --> 1:26:10.480]  them and their bitterness private payroll soar in January the best monthly gain in nearly
[1:26:10.480 --> 1:26:20.320]  five years record economic optimism under Trump better than Reagan Clinton and Obama
[1:26:20.320 --> 1:26:27.320]  John's warns Democrats Trump is helping African Americans in real life they don't care they
[1:26:27.320 --> 1:26:36.360]  want African Americans desperate and poor and needy yes the Democrats are pissed that
[1:26:36.360 --> 1:26:42.040]  black Americans are surging in wealth and prosperity and they don't need government
[1:26:42.040 --> 1:26:50.280]  food stamps the Democrats hate that they want black people under foot that was put on display
[1:26:50.280 --> 1:26:57.680]  last night and then an interesting story out of the Daily Beast Trump at America's top
[1:26:57.680 --> 1:27:03.280]  TV news anchors over for lunch and ate them alive this was basically like you know the
[1:27:03.280 --> 1:27:09.760]  kids get home from school after you know getting caught doing a prank or something and daddy
[1:27:09.760 --> 1:27:14.880]  had to scold them that's basically what this was like you know hey you know you guys are
[1:27:14.880 --> 1:27:19.200]  all fake news you're lying about this country you're trying to keep morale down you're lying
[1:27:19.200 --> 1:27:25.200]  about me time to stop it it's time to grow up it's trying to be real of course they can't
[1:27:25.200 --> 1:27:32.160]  do that that's against their mode of operation but well you give Trump credit for trying
[1:27:32.160 --> 1:27:38.000]  up by the way guys did we ever find out now Ruth Bader Ginsburg was not seen last night
[1:27:38.000 --> 1:27:44.640]  I have not seen anybody talking about this or covering this now where is Ruth Bader
[1:27:44.640 --> 1:27:52.680]  Ginsburg what is her current health status why is she even still on the bench well we
[1:27:52.680 --> 1:27:58.600]  know why ladies and gentlemen the Democrats are desperate for power they'll do anything
[1:27:58.600 --> 1:28:06.520]  to maintain their I don't even know the words for their corruption of the Supreme Court their
[1:28:06.520 --> 1:28:13.920]  corruption of justice their politicization of justice their liberal activism posing as
[1:28:13.920 --> 1:28:20.880]  a judge they can't let that go they need Ruth Bader Ginsburg on that bench even though she
[1:28:20.880 --> 1:28:28.160]  can't even walk who knows her current health status if there was any integrity left in
[1:28:28.160 --> 1:28:33.360]  Ruth Bader Ginsburg if there was any integrity left on the Democrat side of the aisle Ruth
[1:28:33.360 --> 1:28:39.120]  Bader Ginsburg would have already left the bench gracefully but they have no grace they
[1:28:39.120 --> 1:28:45.480]  have no self-awareness all they have is lust for power lust for deception and lust for
[1:28:45.480 --> 1:28:51.880]  dominating you and destroying justice in reality in this country the good news is though as

[1:33:22.560 --> 1:33:27.120]  the alex jones show live but I shot this early in the morning and by the time you're watching
[1:33:27.120 --> 1:33:31.120]  this I should be back in Austin and I'll be back on there soon but Owen shroyer is about
[1:33:31.120 --> 1:33:36.720]  to take over that said we had hoped that the coronavirus was just hype now the evidence
[1:33:36.720 --> 1:33:41.280]  isn't mounting the evidence is clear that it is an engineered bio weapon came out a
[1:33:41.280 --> 1:33:47.760]  week ago that coronavirus contain HIV insertions the delivery system of HIV now new coronavirus
[1:33:47.760 --> 1:33:55.320]  in China is treated with HIV med drugs because it is basically the HIV delivery system and
[1:33:55.320 --> 1:34:00.440]  so people need to understand the viewers are mostly to understand we're not sure exactly
[1:34:00.440 --> 1:34:05.880]  how bad this is going to get but folks really should be prepared and you should be boosting
[1:34:05.880 --> 1:34:10.920]  your immune system and you should be prepared to shelter in place if this turns into a global
[1:34:10.920 --> 1:34:14.640]  pandemic and really start spreading inside the United States the chai comms are being
[1:34:14.640 --> 1:34:23.320]  praised by the UN listen to this they're being praised by the UN for literally shooting people
[1:34:23.320 --> 1:34:27.680]  in the streets and locking down whole cities and putting people in prison if they try to
[1:34:27.680 --> 1:34:30.920]  get outside the quarantine but then when the United States says we're going to stop flights
[1:34:30.920 --> 1:34:36.000]  from China it's called racist and evil and bad that is political correctness at the next
[1:34:36.000 --> 1:34:40.520]  level China's shooting their people but if we just try to stop them coming in then we're
[1:34:40.520 --> 1:34:45.960]  the bad guys ladies and gentlemen that's what we're fighting here is the UN evil their system
[1:34:45.960 --> 1:34:50.480]  is designed to prop up authoritarian states but attack open free societies like America
[1:34:50.480 --> 1:34:55.280]  now back to Owen shroyer and the live broadcast here in the ATX and please never forget that

[1:35:17.440 --> 1:35:26.000]  the resume of dr. Francis Boyle speaks for itself member of the council for responsible
[1:35:26.000 --> 1:35:35.520]  genetics in the early 80s they were organized and even had congressional briefings in the
[1:35:35.520 --> 1:35:41.840]  80s as well and he is the creator of the bio weapons act that was approved by both sides
[1:35:41.840 --> 1:35:46.840]  of congress but this isn't about him but it is important to lay out his background as
[1:35:46.840 --> 1:35:55.040]  an expert in this field as dr. Francis Boyle joins me today dr. Francis Boyle thank you
[1:35:55.040 --> 1:36:01.240]  for joining us well thank you very much on i i do hope our colleague jonathan night is
[1:36:01.240 --> 1:36:07.520]  doing better these days well we thank the audience for their prayers because that does
[1:36:07.520 --> 1:36:14.600]  lift us up when we are feeling ill and he is doing a lot better so Francis this is
[1:36:14.600 --> 1:36:19.040]  really amazing the headlines that you made on an interview the other day the evidence
[1:36:19.040 --> 1:36:28.360]  suggests that this form this strain of a coronavirus is indeed a man made bio weapon
[1:36:28.360 --> 1:36:34.760]  now explain to the audience what evidence you've seen that proves that and what that
[1:36:34.760 --> 1:36:48.120]  means right well in my professional activities i routinely monitor outbreaks of disease uh
[1:36:48.120 --> 1:36:56.960]  affecting humans and animals around the world just to see if there might be a bio warfare
[1:36:56.960 --> 1:37:06.520]  agent at work so when this coronavirus began to be reported there in china i began looking
[1:37:06.520 --> 1:37:13.720]  into it and researching it and i won't go through it all here but eventually it was
[1:37:13.720 --> 1:37:23.000]  my considered judgment that this is a biological warfare agent uh that had leaked out of the
[1:37:23.000 --> 1:37:35.400]  wuhan uh biosafety level four laboratory uh that has a previous history of leaks there
[1:37:35.400 --> 1:37:43.440]  and so uh bsl four laboratories have basically one purpose and that is to research develop
[1:37:43.440 --> 1:37:51.800]  test and stockpile biological warfare uh weapons put aside all the propaganda in support of
[1:37:51.800 --> 1:37:58.680]  these things uh by uh anyone uh but that's that's why they're there there's no legitimate
[1:37:58.680 --> 1:38:08.800]  scientific health reason for bsl four uh laboratories so at that point i did put out a notice on
[1:38:08.800 --> 1:38:16.600]  the inter on the internet uh saying that i thought it was a bio warfare uh weapon and
[1:38:16.600 --> 1:38:24.760]  it had gained a function uh properties which meant uh it was dna genetically uh engineered
[1:38:24.760 --> 1:38:35.000]  uh to be more lethal and more uh infectious than uh say a normal uh bio warfare uh agent
[1:38:35.000 --> 1:38:40.640]  and ever since i gave that an interview which was i don't know i guess two weeks ago or
[1:38:40.640 --> 1:38:51.160]  so today um all the evidence coming out has has confirmed uh my conclusion uh it does
[1:38:51.160 --> 1:39:01.560]  appear this is a dna genetically engineered camera that it has uh um in it uh as you correctly
[1:39:01.560 --> 1:39:08.760]  pointed out the uh hiv now i believe the indian researchers have been pressured to withdraw
[1:39:08.760 --> 1:39:14.520]  by their government obvious that good relations with china uh that study but i read it and
[1:39:14.520 --> 1:39:21.800]  it's quite convincing and they have the pictures there uh i also believe it has the uh flu virus
[1:39:21.800 --> 1:39:32.120]  uh in there and then it also has sars uh that lab is uh reported to do sars work uh so at
[1:39:32.120 --> 1:39:38.440]  a minimum i think that is what that we are facing right now uh based on all the evidence
[1:39:38.440 --> 1:39:47.080]  i i have seen which means uh right now there is a lethality rate of 15 percent of the uh
[1:39:47.080 --> 1:39:56.680]  people infected uh there is an infectious rate of uh 83 percent uh any droplets uh expelled uh
[1:39:56.680 --> 1:40:05.240]  from a victim can travel at least six feet uh through the air uh that to me indicates gain
[1:40:05.240 --> 1:40:13.560]  of function uh uh properties um and there is an incubation period of at least 14 days
[1:40:14.280 --> 1:40:21.560]  and right now uh people infected can be uh asymptomatic for those 14 days so you really
[1:40:21.560 --> 1:40:27.800]  don't know if they are infected and they very well could be um uh spreading the disease with
[1:40:27.800 --> 1:40:37.160]  without any of us knowing about it so this is a very dangerous biological warfare agent we
[1:40:37.160 --> 1:40:43.720]  don't even know the rest of it between you and me what what what these uh uh chinese people
[1:40:43.720 --> 1:40:51.080]  researchers did there uh i have no idea it could be even more dangerous that i i don't know uh but
[1:40:51.080 --> 1:40:59.000]  uh it's obvious the chinese government has been lying about this uh from the get go uh the first
[1:40:59.000 --> 1:41:07.640]  patient was identified uh december 1 uh and he had nothing to do with that uh uh uh market
[1:41:08.360 --> 1:41:13.400]  that's just disinformation that people pick this up at at the market it's baloney and then
[1:41:13.960 --> 1:41:19.720]  i buy a warfare uh programs they want to cover up they always blame it on bats you know bats
[1:41:19.720 --> 1:41:26.200]  have been around forever so give me a break so i i added all this together i just concluded that
[1:41:27.000 --> 1:41:32.120]  that's what it is the chinese government has been lying about it from the get go covering it up
[1:41:32.120 --> 1:41:38.360]  just like they did on sars uh the who is in on it you can't believe anything the who uh
[1:41:38.360 --> 1:41:46.440]  is telling you because uh this is a who special designated research lab the who is uh up to its
[1:41:46.440 --> 1:41:54.840]  eyeballs in uh biological warfare uh research and you had the who director tentrose uh over
[1:41:54.840 --> 1:42:01.240]  there uh meeting uh president g shaking his hand and yucking it up and saying oh china is doing a
[1:42:01.240 --> 1:42:07.960]  great job yeah they're doing a great job covering it up so you can't believe uh the who and the cdc
[1:42:07.960 --> 1:42:14.760]  well you can't believe them either the cbc cdc has been up to its eyeballs again in dirty biological
[1:42:14.760 --> 1:42:21.640]  warfare work uh at least going back to the reagan administration when the cdc and the
[1:42:21.640 --> 1:42:29.880]  american-type culture uh collection authorized the uh shipment of at least 40 supplies different
[1:42:29.880 --> 1:42:36.120]  supplies of weapons specific biological agents well we're gonna go to a break here we'll get
[1:42:36.120 --> 1:42:41.640]  back into these specifics but i think the obvious reason for the cover up here would be this is
[1:42:41.640 --> 1:42:47.160]  a violation of the biological weapons act this is a violation of the geneva convention this is a
[1:42:47.160 --> 1:42:57.880]  crime against humanity dr francis boil is with us we'll be right back the demand for food has not
[1:42:57.880 --> 1:43:03.640]  let up we are selling record amounts of it everybody else is basically already sold out
[1:43:03.640 --> 1:43:09.560]  or they have a giant waitlist our suppliers have it in-house mistaken seven to ten days to deliver
[1:43:09.560 --> 1:43:15.080]  because again they have to package it they're running 24 hours a day but in a few days they're
[1:43:15.080 --> 1:43:19.400]  telling me it may go to a longer wait if you haven't gotten your order yet so i wouldn't crash
[1:43:19.400 --> 1:43:24.520]  today we wanted this virus to be peering out we wanted to just be hype looks like it is really
[1:43:24.520 --> 1:43:29.400]  really bad and is man-made and so that's why we're seeing the huge freakouts so get your
[1:43:29.400 --> 1:43:34.680]  storable food at info wars of store dot com that helps funder operation it's insurance you can eat
[1:43:34.680 --> 1:43:40.840]  a total 360 win again get your food and actually get it delivered at info wars of store dot com
[1:43:40.840 --> 1:43:46.840]  get your order in it's locked in guaranteed seven to ten days info wars of store dot com and regardless
[1:43:46.840 --> 1:43:50.920]  it funds the operation we also have the immune gargle at 40 percent off we are going to sell
[1:43:50.920 --> 1:43:55.960]  out of that but i'm just keeping it at that sales price info wars store dot com well it's here the
[1:43:55.960 --> 1:44:01.480]  year 2020 world governments out in the open we've got the predicted mass pandemics and they're calling
[1:44:01.480 --> 1:44:07.320]  for global government as the answer and we've got massive huge censorship taking place it's coordinated
[1:44:07.320 --> 1:44:15.000]  by big tech and banks against people that promote america and guns and freedom and jesus and the family
[1:44:15.000 --> 1:44:20.520]  and the protection of the unborn wow yes now we know we're right the new world order is real
[1:44:20.520 --> 1:44:25.160]  satanism is real the pedophile a leader real but we're real as well and we love god and we're
[1:44:25.160 --> 1:44:30.280]  standing up and saying no but i just want to make the point here one month into 2020 that we have
[1:44:30.280 --> 1:44:36.040]  never been in cancels we have never been in some smallville place that didn't matter everything we
[1:44:36.040 --> 1:44:41.160]  do every decision we make governs the future of our species and everything we've gone through
[1:44:41.160 --> 1:44:44.680]  and everything we're gonna go through so it's an incredible time to be alive i'm gonna thank you all
[1:44:44.680 --> 1:44:50.200]  for being aware and being involved but just remember your action now via prayer word of mouth
[1:44:50.200 --> 1:44:54.440]  and financial support of info wars store dot com is critical so please take action
[1:44:54.440 --> 1:45:02.520]  it was about a week and a half ago that my father came rushing into my office in the morning and said
[1:45:02.520 --> 1:45:07.960]  son you've got to see this uh the company that holds the patents on the nano silver that's in our
[1:45:07.960 --> 1:45:12.120]  toothpaste that's in our immune gargle and that's in some of the other great products like the super
[1:45:12.120 --> 1:45:19.720]  silver wound shell had reports from back in 2007 with the pentagon working with a and m and homeland
[1:45:19.720 --> 1:45:25.880]  security with the director of homeland security certifying an unrestricted document confidential
[1:45:25.880 --> 1:45:31.960]  documents was noted as that this had been proven in their secret test to be knocking out sars well
[1:45:31.960 --> 1:45:37.720]  ladies and gentlemen regardless now they authorized us to talk about this i talked about it on the show
[1:45:37.720 --> 1:45:42.840]  last week just hiding in plain view this is a product that we had stockpile and we're still
[1:45:42.840 --> 1:45:47.880]  selling it 40 percent off or more with the combos so you get it in your hands it's something that's
[1:45:47.880 --> 1:45:52.840]  good for everyday use regardless and it funds the operation so info wars store dot com for your
[1:45:52.840 --> 1:45:57.000]  immune gargle and other products that contain this key net of silver there's a new way to

[1:47:14.680 --> 1:47:22.920]  broadcasting live from the un stronghold austin texas you're listening to the alex jones show
[1:47:22.920 --> 1:47:33.320]  and now your host owin shroyer and by guest is dr frances boyle who made headlines the other day
[1:47:33.320 --> 1:47:42.360]  after seeing the evidence coming from indian doctors seeing hiv basically implanted into the
[1:47:42.360 --> 1:47:51.640]  coronavirus as well as evidence of sars or the flu being put in there as well but dr boyle before
[1:47:51.640 --> 1:47:59.720]  we get back into the specifics of that i think just the very concept of a bio weapon is probably
[1:47:59.720 --> 1:48:05.720]  shocking to a lot of people many people might not even believe that that kind of thing goes on
[1:48:06.360 --> 1:48:10.280]  but we do know this goes on there's labs in china there's labs in the united states
[1:48:10.920 --> 1:48:19.480]  just briefly talk about bio warfare programs that exist that show hey this stuff is very real
[1:48:19.480 --> 1:48:27.640]  well i have an entire book on that called bio warfare and terrorism that's pretty cheap and
[1:48:27.640 --> 1:48:35.240]  inexpensive you can get it at amazon i've i've been involved in this i guess for the i'm only
[1:48:35.240 --> 1:48:42.040]  speaking here i'm not speaking for the council for responsible genetics but they asked me to get
[1:48:42.040 --> 1:48:50.120]  involved in this as a lawyer for them i guess in the early 1980s or uh sometime but let me say this
[1:48:50.920 --> 1:48:58.760]  in all honesty i don't believe president trump is getting proper scientific advice
[1:48:59.560 --> 1:49:06.280]  about how dangerous this really is and that it is an offensive biological warfare weapon
[1:49:06.280 --> 1:49:13.880]  basically he has surrounding him all these scientists who have been up to their eyeballs
[1:49:13.880 --> 1:49:22.200]  in this dirty work dirty biological warfare work here in the united states so i have no idea what
[1:49:22.200 --> 1:49:29.240]  they're telling president trump but i suspect they're spinning it to protect their own rear ends here
[1:49:29.240 --> 1:49:37.640]  in my opinion uh every bsl4 laboratory here in america should be shut down immediately and also
[1:49:37.640 --> 1:49:45.000]  every bsl3 laboratory should be shut down uh immediately if you hit the internet i i gave
[1:49:45.000 --> 1:49:52.280]  an interview on a documentary called anthrax wars dealing with all these uh bsl3 and bsl4
[1:49:52.280 --> 1:49:59.800]  uh facilities uh with respect to the united states of america and i said this is a catastrophe waiting
[1:49:59.800 --> 1:50:07.640]  to happen well now it has happened in china and i feel very badly for the chinese people i'm not
[1:50:07.640 --> 1:50:14.920]  here to bash china or the chinese people the chinese system of government uh under international law
[1:50:14.920 --> 1:50:20.280]  they can have whatever system they want over there uh but we're here in america and we are
[1:50:20.280 --> 1:50:28.360]  going to need to take uh very drastic uh measures here uh to protect ourselves and i just don't think
[1:50:28.360 --> 1:50:34.840]  that uh president trump is is getting that type of advice he has all these swamp creature
[1:50:34.840 --> 1:50:44.200]  scientists around him who i think are are trying to sugarcoat it explain to the audience at a
[1:50:44.200 --> 1:50:52.200]  rudimentary level what goes on in a bio weapons lab or in this specific bsl4 lab in china where
[1:50:52.200 --> 1:50:58.280]  they take a corona virus and then as the indian doctors pointed out with their research insert
[1:50:58.280 --> 1:51:06.840]  hiv or other bugs or viruses into that explain what happens in the lab or why this happens
[1:51:06.840 --> 1:51:15.240]  right well first thing we have to understand the united states government and and apparently china
[1:51:15.960 --> 1:51:21.800]  sent what i could only call these death scientists they like to call themselves life scientists
[1:51:21.800 --> 1:51:29.480]  but the last time i crunched the numbers in 2015 we had 13 000 death scientists doing this dirty
[1:51:29.480 --> 1:51:38.120]  dangerous biological work and they send them out all over the world uh to find uh the most exotic
[1:51:38.120 --> 1:51:45.960]  and dangerous types of biological organisms they can't then they bring them uh back into their labs
[1:51:46.520 --> 1:51:54.920]  and see if they can be weaponized uh one way uh or the other with uh uh dna genetic engineering
[1:51:54.920 --> 1:52:03.880]  uh adding uh taking what might be a very dangerous uh biological or organism in the first place
[1:52:04.440 --> 1:52:11.000]  and then adding additional genetic material to it to make it even more dangerous that that it
[1:52:11.000 --> 1:52:19.080]  could actually be disseminated uh as a weapon then once they have done that they uh reverse
[1:52:19.080 --> 1:52:26.440]  engineered the uh technology uh to create a vaccine allegedly a vaccine because you don't
[1:52:26.440 --> 1:52:33.720]  really have a biological weapon unless uh you you have the agent that has been weaponized
[1:52:33.720 --> 1:52:41.000]  and then you have a vaccine that can protect your uh uh own people and so what they do then is say oh
[1:52:41.000 --> 1:52:49.560]  well we have to go out and make vaccines for all these uh uh potentially uh dangerous uh uh biological
[1:52:49.560 --> 1:52:56.040]  organisms out there that we don't even know about and they bring them back uh dna genetic
[1:52:56.040 --> 1:53:05.320]  engineering uh they uh uh enhance their lethality their effectiveness and then uh they they reverse
[1:53:05.320 --> 1:53:15.000]  engineer a uh vaccine and this has now been uh i would say uh uh turbocharged by uh so called
[1:53:15.000 --> 1:53:22.440]  synthetic uh biology with this CRISPR technology where you can go in there and literally uh pin
[1:53:23.320 --> 1:53:32.200]  uh and excise out a gene and put a new gene in uh the whole synthetic biology field was financed
[1:53:32.200 --> 1:53:39.160]  by the pentagon and their DARPA defense uh advanced research program uh agency all of it the whole
[1:53:39.160 --> 1:53:47.480]  synthetic biology uh field has been financed by the pentagon and for bio warfare purposes
[1:53:47.480 --> 1:53:54.680]  indeed the proof of that is that the first big conference of uh synthetic biologists they all
[1:53:54.680 --> 1:54:03.000]  got together to discuss their uh technology and they released a report which i read and in the
[1:54:03.000 --> 1:54:12.760]  report they called for the repeal of my biological weapons anti-terrorism act that had been passed
[1:54:12.760 --> 1:54:20.280]  unanimously by both houses of congress and signed it along by president bush senior why because they
[1:54:20.280 --> 1:54:29.000]  fully intended to use synthetic biology to develop biological weapons that's what the pentagon pays
[1:54:29.000 --> 1:54:35.320]  for you know the pentagon's not out there paying for uh objective scientific research the pentagon
[1:54:35.320 --> 1:54:44.120]  is paying for war related research and that has been going on uh um the the use of dna genetic
[1:54:44.120 --> 1:54:52.040]  engineering uh for bio warfare purposes uh at least the start of the uh reagan administration
[1:54:52.040 --> 1:54:59.400]  when i i got involved the council for responsibility for responsible genetics got me involved
[1:55:00.200 --> 1:55:09.080]  in that and now we've moved over this new dimension of uh synthetic uh biology but even before uh
[1:55:09.080 --> 1:55:18.200]  reagan uh nixon did sign the biological weapons convention in 1974 but that didn't mean we we
[1:55:18.200 --> 1:55:26.680]  stopped developing uh biological weapons we simply it was brought underground uh by the pentagon
[1:55:26.680 --> 1:55:35.320]  and by the cia and this continued uh underground um and then the reagan people uh and their neocons
[1:55:35.320 --> 1:55:42.280]  and we know the neocons uh you know if you look at that uh p neck uh support uh report you'll see
[1:55:42.280 --> 1:55:49.960]  they they uh advocate biological weapons ethnic specific biological weapons as uh tools of uh
[1:55:50.760 --> 1:55:58.680]  of warfare so under reagan then uh they first began to apply dna genetic engineering uh to
[1:55:58.680 --> 1:56:05.960]  dangerous uh biological uh agents before then that were just in nature to make them more dangerous
[1:56:05.960 --> 1:56:12.040]  uh and that's where i came in on on the story but it's all told in my book there uh bio warfare
[1:56:12.040 --> 1:56:17.160]  and uh terrorism and it's it's inexpensive i'm not here you know making a lot of royalties but
[1:56:17.160 --> 1:56:22.760]  it's important information and in the 90 seconds we have left with you if you could have president
[1:56:22.760 --> 1:56:29.560]  trump's ear right now what would you tell him about this coronavirus and how we need to be responding
[1:56:29.560 --> 1:56:39.080]  to it it's an extremely dangerous um biological warfare agent we have not seen anything uh like
[1:56:39.080 --> 1:56:46.360]  this uh before uh uh you know you have to go back to the spanish flu virus uh i think uh between you
[1:56:46.360 --> 1:56:55.320]  and me um and uh it has to be treated uh accordingly and instead of relying on these swamp creature
[1:56:55.320 --> 1:57:03.960]  scientists he needs to bring in outside independent uh experts who have never been feeding uh at the
[1:57:04.840 --> 1:57:11.400]  trough of biological warfare programs by the united states government uh because they all
[1:57:11.400 --> 1:57:19.160]  have a vested interest in this as i said the last time i crunched the numbers in uh 2015 you had at
[1:57:19.160 --> 1:57:27.400]  least 13 000 of these death scientists uh doing this dr mangala type work they should all be
[1:57:27.400 --> 1:57:34.920]  completely disqualified and president trump has the authority to shut down immediately every bsl
[1:57:34.920 --> 1:57:43.240]  four and bsl three uh laboratory in the united states of america that should be done right away
[1:57:43.240 --> 1:57:48.360]  and then more stringent measures i've got to really hand it to the listeners and viewers from
[1:57:48.360 --> 1:57:55.480]  full wars your support and your help in rebooting americana is a challenge to the globalist system
[1:57:55.480 --> 1:58:01.720]  of corporate tyranny has really caught hold not just here in the u.s worldwide and president trump's
[1:58:01.720 --> 1:58:07.960]  fearlessness when it comes to promoting americana and basic liberty is amazing as well he's still
[1:58:07.960 --> 1:58:13.080]  lacking on the big tech uh censorship taking action against that in some other areas but
[1:58:13.080 --> 1:58:17.720]  trying to end the wars boosting our economy speaking out against chimes china trump's been
[1:58:17.720 --> 1:58:24.040]  doing an amazing job but now more than ever we really have to realize that we're being targeted
[1:58:24.040 --> 1:58:30.520]  because we are effective and the globalists are beginning to lose their war against humanity in a
[1:58:30.520 --> 1:58:34.840]  big way and so we're going to see some major fireworks out of them but it's critical to not
[1:58:34.840 --> 1:58:40.600]  let ourselves get down when we see all the poison they spray at us that's an attempt to demoralize
[1:58:40.600 --> 1:58:47.800]  us we've got to remember that and stay focused and stay happy i love watching david night in the
[1:58:47.800 --> 1:58:52.920]  morning i love tuning in to oh and shroyer i love all the other shows we do here but i'll be honest
[1:58:52.920 --> 1:58:58.440]  with you we run during the breaks a lot of news reports because i'm sick of hearing the ads
[1:58:58.440 --> 1:59:03.320]  so you think you don't want to hear an ad i don't want to hear an ad but here's the bottom line

[2:01:31.000 --> 2:01:41.240]  current political strife and struggle and it was such a victory for america that it needs to be
[2:01:41.240 --> 2:01:47.240]  reflected on it needs to be celebrated it needs to be toasted it needs to be remembered for what it

[2:02:45.640 --> 2:02:52.920]  stops they will stop at nothing to keep this under wraps the truth about the coronavirus
[2:02:52.920 --> 2:02:59.560]  and the death count and just the people in china wanting to be free info wars dot com police lock
[2:02:59.560 --> 2:03:06.440]  potential coronavirus victim in her own home and more and more the disturbing consensus
[2:03:06.440 --> 2:03:11.880]  coming out of reports in china is that this has now been basically turned into whether this was
[2:03:11.880 --> 2:03:17.240]  its original intention or not is debatable it's been turned into an opportunity for the chinese
[2:03:17.240 --> 2:03:25.400]  government to basically arrest people and take people prisoner could it be used for political
[2:03:27.400 --> 2:03:33.320]  prisoners as well absolutely and they're basically just taking people in the chinese
[2:03:33.320 --> 2:03:38.600]  communist government that is and just locking them up throwing away the key some people are
[2:03:38.600 --> 2:03:48.120]  they're basically having mass cremations of people too i mean it really shows you the desolation
[2:03:48.120 --> 2:03:55.400]  of a communist government but then also the seriousness of this outbreak woman wearing
[2:03:55.400 --> 2:04:02.360]  face mask attack in possible coronavirus hate crime that's from the new york post new york post
[2:04:02.360 --> 2:04:10.120]  again chinese baby test positive for coronavirus 30 hours after birth daily star wuhan coronavirus
[2:04:10.120 --> 2:04:17.960]  cremations working 24 7 burning 100 bodies a day according to an insider uh and some other
[2:04:17.960 --> 2:04:23.640]  headlines government unveils new electronic tags for people under wuhan coronavirus home quarantine
[2:04:24.520 --> 2:04:28.760]  you're basically just locked down and if you go out in the streets you're you're
[2:04:28.760 --> 2:04:37.080]  facing either a chinese government killing you or uh you know who knows giant flocks of crowds
[2:04:37.080 --> 2:04:42.440]  and huge excuse me giant flocks of pros and huge mosquitoes invade skies around coronavirus
[2:04:42.440 --> 2:04:49.240]  ground zero in china scary stuff happening in china right now with the corona virus but
[2:04:49.240 --> 2:04:52.920]  when we return from this short break your phone calls on the state of the union
[2:04:52.920 --> 2:05:02.360]  it is i the leader of cobra here for a message to president trump the american people and alex
[2:05:02.360 --> 2:05:09.720]  jones of info wars our operations with our partners the communist chinese have bought control
[2:05:09.720 --> 2:05:17.800]  of your media but it's true your people are beginning to awaken that's why cobra is
[2:05:17.800 --> 2:05:24.520]  launching operations to trigger race war mass shootings and bombings which will be blamed on
[2:05:24.520 --> 2:05:31.800]  those loyal to america anyone once we stage these attacks that does not blame it on trump
[2:05:31.800 --> 2:05:41.720]  we'll also be targeted by cobra in the future you see when you expose our false flags and fake media
[2:05:41.720 --> 2:05:49.880]  i will carry out attacks and then blame you like we've done with alex jones blaming him for mass
[2:05:49.880 --> 2:05:53.720]  shootings we committed ha ha hey oh cobra
[2:05:53.720 --> 2:06:11.640]  you found it the tip of the spear it is the alex jones show with owin croyer
[2:06:15.320 --> 2:06:19.160]  all right ladies and gentlemen the phone lines are lit up we're going to go to your phone calls
[2:06:19.160 --> 2:06:27.960]  let me just put some wraps on a couple things here before we do that death counts are allegedly
[2:06:27.960 --> 2:06:38.040]  being leaked now out of china and it's worse than we think or then original that original reports
[2:06:38.040 --> 2:06:46.920]  were coming out then this story just broke epstein had a mystery bank basically he had his own
[2:06:46.920 --> 2:06:51.080]  offshore bank on the virgin islands that now is being discovered i guess that's where
[2:06:52.440 --> 2:07:01.720]  the financier comes into play uh no this was the most famous and well organized industrial
[2:07:02.680 --> 2:07:11.640]  sex trafficking network in the world that was implicating royalty around the world
[2:07:11.640 --> 2:07:19.800]  uh politicians in the united states celebrities in the united states and beyond and meanwhile
[2:07:19.800 --> 2:07:30.680]  jislane maxwell number one procurer of women for epstein still roams free amazing how that works
[2:07:30.680 --> 2:07:43.080]  the shadow app that came out as basically i guess the app that they used to rig the vote count
[2:07:43.080 --> 2:07:51.960]  of the iowa caucuses a few nights ago not only was it being operated and set up by former
[2:07:51.960 --> 2:08:03.720]  hillary clinton campaign members and supporters the number one funder is you guessed it george soros
[2:08:06.200 --> 2:08:15.000]  george soros strikes again ladies and gentlemen and the iowa caucus uh rig job by the democrats
[2:08:15.000 --> 2:08:19.640]  just out in public combined with the state of the union last night combined with what is about to
[2:08:19.640 --> 2:08:30.520]  be the vote to equip trump basically marks the death of the democrat party and they did it to
[2:08:30.520 --> 2:08:36.840]  themselves and it's ironic the democrat party at the top is scared to death of bernie sanders because
[2:08:36.840 --> 2:08:43.560]  he is a commie a radical communist socialist but if you look at the future of the democrat party
[2:08:43.560 --> 2:08:49.400]  which they're ingratiating themselves to the likes of an aoc or an ilhan omar or a reshita
[2:08:49.400 --> 2:08:57.160]  talib they're radical communists so where the democrat party goes from here hopefully it's the
[2:08:57.160 --> 2:09:04.840]  the likes of the kkk gone for good and you know by the way i want to point this out because this
[2:09:04.840 --> 2:09:13.800]  is so important for people to understand and and almost impossible to comprehend because you really
[2:09:13.800 --> 2:09:21.480]  have no control over this and we've all been conditioned and programmed to trusting search
[2:09:21.480 --> 2:09:30.200]  engine optimization specifically google when we're looking for answers to anything google
[2:09:30.200 --> 2:09:41.800]  is now essentially rigging reality and it needs to be widely understood that search results on
[2:09:41.800 --> 2:09:54.440]  google are not real not organic not legitimate and of course this will be a struggle for current
[2:09:54.440 --> 2:10:00.840]  generations and future generations because of the indoctrination of google into our life
[2:10:02.040 --> 2:10:08.120]  because of the conditioning of oh just google it if you have a question on something no google
[2:10:08.120 --> 2:10:17.880]  search engine algorithm is rigged specifically politically in its nature rigged to protect
[2:10:17.880 --> 2:10:26.440]  communism protect the democrat party in the west and protect the false narratives propping up
[2:10:27.880 --> 2:10:37.960]  those ideologies and those party members and their brainwashed minions where you can't eat folks
[2:10:38.680 --> 2:10:45.080]  i really don't know how else to measure this i'll just give you an example it's well known history
[2:10:45.080 --> 2:10:53.560]  well documented history the democrat party was founded by kkk members at the outset of the democrat
[2:10:53.560 --> 2:10:59.880]  party it is the kkk and in fact if you look at the first members of congress that were republicans
[2:10:59.880 --> 2:11:06.120]  it was freed black men who wanted to fight this political corruption known as the kkk
[2:11:06.120 --> 2:11:16.200]  in politics now masquerading around as the democrat party google has erased that from the memory hole
[2:11:17.320 --> 2:11:24.600]  and so the average leftist will plug into google democrats start the kkk and google has revised
[2:11:24.600 --> 2:11:32.280]  that history and they now use snopes and politico and other fake news sites to bury that fact about
[2:11:32.280 --> 2:11:36.520]  the democrat party because these people run around all day long pointing the finger at everybody
[2:11:36.520 --> 2:11:42.200]  saying oh you're a racist if you disagree with their ideologies no they're the racists at every
[2:11:42.200 --> 2:11:49.720]  level the very foundation of the democrat party is based in racism and it's from the kkk but now
[2:11:49.720 --> 2:11:58.200]  because google becomes the granddaddy of history people will plug that in and think oh it's fake news
[2:11:58.200 --> 2:12:08.040]  even though it's very well documented and this is the threat of google to our history to our reality
[2:12:08.040 --> 2:12:13.880]  and to future generations of americans it is the single greatest threat of knowledge and information
[2:12:13.880 --> 2:12:19.480]  that i can think of right now it's evil it's disgusting it's despicable it's criminal
[2:12:19.480 --> 2:12:31.080]  but you see because the left is so indoctrined into this they don't care and they will allow it to
[2:12:31.080 --> 2:12:37.800]  happen and they will celebrate revisionist history because that's the only way they can exist that's
[2:12:37.800 --> 2:12:45.480]  the only way they can justify their ideologies and it makes me sick it makes me sick for future
[2:12:45.480 --> 2:12:52.760]  generations of americans and humans on earth that don't know any better that are being deceived by
[2:12:52.760 --> 2:13:02.360]  google this is the work of the devil google is now a tool of satan and it quite frankly
[2:13:02.360 --> 2:13:11.320]  angers me to my core in my soul knowing what these people are doing they cannot win elections
[2:13:11.320 --> 2:13:20.760]  legitimately so they cheat they cannot inspire and inform people legitimately so they lie and deceive
[2:13:23.240 --> 2:13:30.920]  and it is so important it is so important that at the outset of this what we're witnessing right now
[2:13:33.000 --> 2:13:38.760]  with the rigged algorithms and fake news search results that google promotes
[2:13:38.760 --> 2:13:46.760]  this we need to market what it is now so future generations of americans and world citizens
[2:13:46.760 --> 2:13:51.960]  know google is lying to you google is evil google is a tool of the devil
[2:13:53.720 --> 2:13:59.720]  and communists and socialists and radicals and leftists are going to use the power of google
[2:13:59.720 --> 2:14:08.680]  to deceive humans to deceive children to deceive reality and it makes me sick
[2:14:11.000 --> 2:14:21.320]  meanwhile on twitter they're banning memes yeah they're banning memes and
[2:14:21.320 --> 2:14:29.080]  the stories at info wars dot com too effective twitter and youtube declare war on memes ahead
[2:14:29.080 --> 2:14:36.600]  of 2020 election and they say our new rule this is from twitter safety you may not deceptively
[2:14:36.600 --> 2:14:42.280]  share synthetic or manipulated media that is likely to cause harm in addition we may label
[2:14:42.280 --> 2:14:46.840]  tweets containing synthetic and manipulated media to help people understand their authenticity and to
[2:14:46.840 --> 2:14:53.160]  provide context this is just like twitter announcing their other new report feature that says oh we're
[2:14:53.160 --> 2:14:57.080]  reporting this you can report things for being misleading about a political election now again
[2:14:57.080 --> 2:15:03.160]  this is all aimed at truth and reality this is all aimed at you this is all aimed at conservatives
[2:15:03.160 --> 2:15:10.440]  this is all aimed at trump in a real world should this be applied organically and fairly
[2:15:11.080 --> 2:15:16.120]  this would actually shut down democrats like mike bloomberg running ads of children cages
[2:15:16.120 --> 2:15:21.080]  during the obama years this would shut down all the lies of the democrats about trump being a racist
[2:15:21.080 --> 2:15:25.880]  in a bigot and everything like that but that's not how it's going to be used that's not how it's
[2:15:25.880 --> 2:15:31.960]  going to be applied so more deception more lies from the tech left more lies from the democrats
[2:15:31.960 --> 2:15:39.560]  and then just a total i don't even know what you would call this sham a total sham
[2:15:39.560 --> 2:15:46.920]  of internet censorship claiming is to protect you when it's to protect their own political interest
[2:15:46.920 --> 2:15:53.800]  that's why they've now locked james oakie and project veritas's account on twitter it's too powerful

[2:19:11.880 --> 2:19:17.640]  toothpaste is by far the best toothpaste i've ever tried and i'm 45 years old and i've tried a lot
[2:19:17.640 --> 2:19:22.760]  of different toothpaste and it's fluoride free i think the big difference the game changer in

[2:19:28.040 --> 2:19:32.840]  toothpaste that i don't even like rinse out my mouth after i brush my teeth with this it feels so

[2:21:53.720 --> 2:21:58.920]  audience's reaction to last night's state of the union address i considered it a super bowl victory
[2:21:58.920 --> 2:22:07.000]  for america let's go to riko in minnesota go ahead riko hey owen how you doing good thank you it's
[2:22:07.000 --> 2:22:12.520]  good talking to you a long time listener and as far as the state of the union i thought it was
[2:22:12.520 --> 2:22:18.360]  absolutely fantastic his speeches just keep getting better and better the thing that i thought was
[2:22:18.360 --> 2:22:24.280]  shameful was the chorus Nancy ripping up the speech and i personally don't think that that was a
[2:22:24.280 --> 2:22:29.320]  random action i believe that that was completely premeditated no no no you're actually a hundred
[2:22:29.320 --> 2:22:34.760]  percent right i don't know if you realize this or not there's actually now new emerging footage
[2:22:34.760 --> 2:22:40.280]  before the speech even started she practiced ripping it to see if she could so yeah she planned
[2:22:40.280 --> 2:22:45.800]  the whole time to do that what a bitch i believe that she planned to do that so that would take
[2:22:45.800 --> 2:22:51.400]  away from people talking about the message in trump speech talking about what he had to say
[2:22:51.400 --> 2:22:56.680]  to make that the focus oh well if we could get them to exactly and doesn't that just show you
[2:22:56.680 --> 2:23:01.880]  who these people really are the most arrogant self-serving people on earth who really think
[2:23:01.880 --> 2:23:05.960]  they're more important than america they really think they're more important than the average american
[2:23:05.960 --> 2:23:11.160]  having a better job having a better life having some hope and inspiration that's what these people
[2:23:11.160 --> 2:23:16.600]  are about that's why there's such pigs they think it's all about them they wanted to steal the energy
[2:23:16.600 --> 2:23:22.200]  from america's prosperity steal the energy from the millions of americans that feel inspired by
[2:23:22.200 --> 2:23:27.720]  a speech like that and make it all about them these are petulant children you know petulant
[2:23:27.720 --> 2:23:32.360]  children is exactly the uh the phrase that was used when she ripped it up the lady who was sitting
[2:23:32.360 --> 2:23:38.440]  next to me we had a mega meat watch party you know um and so we were sitting there and that was the
[2:23:38.440 --> 2:23:44.520]  exact word she was acting like a petulant child and uh i think trump's signal on the very last
[2:23:44.520 --> 2:23:50.760]  thing he said was it's only going to get better or the best is yet to come i think that was the
[2:23:50.760 --> 2:23:56.360]  signal to us as voters because he had mentioned something a few shows ago i was about a week ago
[2:23:56.360 --> 2:24:01.960]  how it's like the fourth of july nine o'clock the fireworks are going off 9 15 9 30 it's like hey
[2:24:01.960 --> 2:24:07.800]  when are the fireworks the book gonna start i think that was his message to us is they just
[2:24:07.800 --> 2:24:12.680]  hold tight folks those fireworks are gonna start coming and i'll tell you you know when i was
[2:24:12.680 --> 2:24:17.800]  referencing that i was speaking more of you know let's start arresting some of these criminals in
[2:24:17.800 --> 2:24:23.800]  the government the james comey's the brennan's the clappers um but you know politically last night
[2:24:24.680 --> 2:24:31.960]  trump has so much momentum politically after that and so many people will never vote democrat
[2:24:31.960 --> 2:24:37.640]  again because of the display the democrats put on last night riko thank you for the call
[2:24:37.640 --> 2:24:46.040]  let's go to danie in organ go ahead danie you know and get back to you again man uh so yeah i i
[2:24:46.040 --> 2:24:51.720]  just kind of echoing what what the last gentleman said um at first i was a little frustrated with
[2:24:51.720 --> 2:24:57.720]  the amount of attention people you know even on the the right side of the aisle uh or with any kind
[2:24:57.720 --> 2:25:04.280]  of sense you know we're giving to uh the anti-plosive stunt because it's exactly what they wanted
[2:25:04.280 --> 2:25:10.840]  they wanted to take away from the amazing speech you know the the guests that they had there which
[2:25:10.840 --> 2:25:18.840]  really just made it the most i i've never cried watching anything political and i wasn't crying
[2:25:18.840 --> 2:25:25.800]  like a like a leftist uh it went hillary clinton lost like a baby whining it was more as you said
[2:25:25.800 --> 2:25:32.440]  earlier that you know i touched my heart it was emotional uh seeing the the the medal given to rush
[2:25:32.440 --> 2:25:38.440]  after his you know cancer diagnosis uh you know the the families of the fallen soldiers and and
[2:25:38.440 --> 2:25:47.400]  so forth you know just incredible uh message from the president yeah and it's not that it's not that
[2:25:47.400 --> 2:25:54.840]  we highlight the behavior of the democrats last night to give it any you know plausible momentum
[2:25:54.840 --> 2:25:59.160]  it's just to point out it's kind of like again like i i keep using sports analogies but it's like
[2:25:59.160 --> 2:26:05.800]  after the super bowl like a 49ers fan runs on the on the field and takes a crap like to try to ruin
[2:26:05.800 --> 2:26:09.720]  the game well that doesn't ruin it for anybody it's just it just makes you look like an idiot
[2:26:10.760 --> 2:26:15.880]  yeah exactly uh you know like and i was saying at first i was a little bit frustrated seeing the
[2:26:15.880 --> 2:26:21.160]  amount of attention that it received uh taking away from the the actual speech itself but you
[2:26:21.160 --> 2:26:25.800]  know that i noticed today uh just looked at twitter a minute ago that all of you know i'm
[2:26:25.800 --> 2:26:31.720]  saying maybe five out of ten of the top uh trending you know things on hashtags in the
[2:26:31.720 --> 2:26:38.040]  us right now or you know number one and petty Pelosi uh you know and it just goes on uh and
[2:26:38.040 --> 2:26:42.360]  i'll tell you what the amazing thing about this is they still won't get it they still have no
[2:26:42.360 --> 2:26:48.120]  self-awareness they have no ability to reflect on their own abhorrent behavior and so they're
[2:26:48.120 --> 2:26:54.120]  just going to get worse i mean i can't imagine how poorly the democrats are going to start
[2:26:54.120 --> 2:26:58.360]  behaving now i mean this is uh it's going to be really abhorrent and disgusting but that's
[2:26:58.360 --> 2:27:03.160]  that's who these people are thanks for the call dany let's go to trina in nebraska go ahead trina
[2:27:04.280 --> 2:27:12.120]  hey how you doing on good thank you good um yeah so besides her ripping up the speech um the
[2:27:12.120 --> 2:27:18.360]  misgrant Pelosi also i don't know if you noticed but she was like talking to somebody randomly i
[2:27:18.360 --> 2:27:22.760]  don't know who she was talking to possibly an imaginary friend while trump was giving the
[2:27:22.760 --> 2:27:27.640]  speech did you notice that even mike was like whoa what are you doing yeah i kind of thought she
[2:27:27.640 --> 2:27:33.640]  was trying to address uh because you know she is kind of a power witch so i thought to me it looked
[2:27:33.640 --> 2:27:37.640]  like she was trying to address the democrats like telling them to sit or stand kind of like she's
[2:27:37.640 --> 2:27:43.000]  done before when she's gathering in hearings and stuff to me that was her her more trying to control
[2:27:43.000 --> 2:27:48.120]  the democrats uh over there but who knows maybe she was so drunk she just started talking to herself
[2:27:48.120 --> 2:27:55.400]  yeah no definitely um and then the second thing about the coronavirus i guess in camp ashland
[2:27:55.400 --> 2:28:03.000]  here we're going to be quarantined um i don't know about 70 possible people that may be infected
[2:28:03.000 --> 2:28:08.440]  or were exposed to the coronavirus and they're going to quarantine them for 14 days and the
[2:28:08.440 --> 2:28:12.920]  gentleman that you just had on speaking about how that may not be enough time to notice any
[2:28:12.920 --> 2:28:21.960]  some done that's kind of scaring me well you know i think that um it is obviously scary
[2:28:21.960 --> 2:28:28.520]  and uh i know that there's other areas that the pentagon have basically listed as quarantine zones
[2:28:29.320 --> 2:28:37.000]  so the best thing you can do is just to build up your immune system obviously take whatever
[2:28:37.000 --> 2:28:42.120]  measures you know you deem necessary to make sure you're not getting any unwanted germs
[2:28:42.120 --> 2:28:47.880]  into your system as well uh but you know hopefully this thing uh stays in china and

[2:33:56.280 --> 2:34:01.960]  state of the union go ahead woody hey owin how are you doing sir good thank you hey we're definitely
[2:34:01.960 --> 2:34:09.320]  going to have to disagree here um front this economy is no better now than what it was under
[2:34:09.320 --> 2:34:17.480]  obama uh i don't see how anyone can even fathom that this economy is even good uh we're still under
[2:34:17.480 --> 2:34:23.560]  23 plus three dollar deficit trump is also printing money and giving back to the central
[2:34:23.560 --> 2:34:29.800]  banks like obama was but when obama did it was bad but when trump does it it's good uh he's talking
[2:34:29.800 --> 2:34:35.880]  about the tax break what happened to the trump that talked about you know eliminating via ira
[2:34:35.880 --> 2:34:38.360]  we're just talking about tax break
[2:34:40.840 --> 2:34:46.440]  the economy's not good the economy is the same one obama had bush had and clinton had nothing's
[2:34:46.440 --> 2:34:52.760]  changed well i can't i don't look i think you're bringing up fair points i don't think it's fair
[2:34:52.760 --> 2:35:00.600]  to say nothing's changed uh a lot has changed if you have a 401k it's going gangbusters uh if you're
[2:35:00.600 --> 2:35:06.440]  trying to start a business you have more opportunity uh if you're an entrepreneur you have less
[2:35:06.440 --> 2:35:13.160]  regulations uh there have been significant tax cuts the points you bring up are fair and valid
[2:35:13.160 --> 2:35:22.680]  however do you not understand the purpose of president trump celebrating the economy as as a
[2:35:22.680 --> 2:35:29.480]  winning factor celebrating the record low unemployment as good things and and using that as
[2:35:29.480 --> 2:35:37.960]  kind of a juxtaposition to all the trajectories it was heading under the past administrations
[2:35:37.960 --> 2:35:43.960]  and just the overall message of get used to being poor get used to the economy going down get used
[2:35:43.960 --> 2:35:48.680]  to america being sucked by the rest of the world that's what you have to deal with uh you don't
[2:35:48.680 --> 2:35:54.440]  think that that was significant well let's let's let's answer that question or that comment i should
[2:35:54.440 --> 2:36:03.640]  say methodically 401k gains are based on artificial fiat currency it doesn't exist okay that's one
[2:36:03.640 --> 2:36:10.120]  number two is all these uh this number's great black americans hispanic americans and and all
[2:36:10.120 --> 2:36:14.760]  those numbers it's literally the equivalent of me and you going back to college and being able
[2:36:14.760 --> 2:36:22.920]  to grade our own papers now again i'm not disagreeing with your overall point the central reserve
[2:36:22.920 --> 2:36:28.040]  the fractional banking system it's all fiat currency it's all fake i'm not disagreeing with
[2:36:28.040 --> 2:36:34.840]  that trump has made the debt just as bad if not worse than obama ever did but what is your solution
[2:36:34.840 --> 2:36:41.240]  to that the end of federal reserve like trump indicated that he would in 2015 and to uh and
[2:36:41.240 --> 2:36:45.960]  stop printing money and given to the central bank sure when you and that's fine and i understand
[2:36:45.960 --> 2:36:52.360]  just as we done may the heavens fall but that would collapse the economy the economy is collapsed sir
[2:36:54.440 --> 2:37:01.080]  well it's it's not i mean you i'm not disagreeing with your points but the economy is not collapsing
[2:37:01.080 --> 2:37:07.480]  i mean people hundreds of millions of people aren't dying of poverty uh the the grocery stores are
[2:37:07.480 --> 2:37:13.800]  still filled with food uh people can afford to get them so i mean again i'm not disagreeing with
[2:37:13.800 --> 2:37:21.160]  your valid points i'm simply saying should those measures be taken which we can argue good or bad
[2:37:21.160 --> 2:37:26.280]  i'm not saying your points aren't valid that would collapse the economy most americans can't
[2:37:26.280 --> 2:37:31.640]  even wrap their head around what the fractional reserve banking system is sure i i understand
[2:37:31.640 --> 2:37:36.680]  that and that is a very complicated issue that you raise in that regard but right now we are
[2:37:36.680 --> 2:37:42.280]  operating under perceived value if people truly understood how broke we were i guarantee you people
[2:37:42.280 --> 2:37:46.600]  stopped buying and get scared and and it would finally collapse but we are collapsed but there
[2:37:46.600 --> 2:37:52.040]  is also we also need to measure there is a a financial struggle happening right now between
[2:37:52.040 --> 2:37:59.800]  the petrodollar and then countries like china and venezuela and others trying to kill that dollar
[2:37:59.800 --> 2:38:06.280]  which is what props up the american fiat currency well that leads me to another point owin is this
[2:38:06.280 --> 2:38:12.040]  puppet president that was installed maduro uh let's let's let's like let me get this straight i don't
[2:38:12.040 --> 2:38:17.720]  i don't agree or like chavez is a successor uh but the bottom line is that they have their
[2:38:17.720 --> 2:38:22.280]  oil and they were throwing it on the market they are literally trying to get a globalist puppet
[2:38:22.280 --> 2:38:27.480]  in there that will play games they play their game with the uh with the the the dollar and the oil
[2:38:27.480 --> 2:38:31.960]  and all that kind of stuff um and then we got iran's not on the central banking reserve they're
[2:38:31.960 --> 2:38:36.680]  getting ready to be invaded north korea and then you mentioned cuba these are all the last places
[2:38:36.680 --> 2:38:42.200]  on earth that do not have a federal reserve dictating their money do you not see the trend
[2:38:43.320 --> 2:38:48.600]  no and that's the trend that's been going on for decades again your points are valid i feel that
[2:38:49.960 --> 2:38:54.680]  and and you may disagree i i just feel that trump has measured it and he's decided to
[2:38:55.400 --> 2:39:01.000]  allow american confidence consumer confidence and this fiat currency to continue to bubble
[2:39:01.000 --> 2:39:07.080]  because at least in his presidency he views it as good for america and again the average american
[2:39:07.080 --> 2:39:12.120]  won't understand the complex things you're talking about he'd rather them understand my 401k just
[2:39:12.120 --> 2:39:17.480]  went up 150 percent uh good or bad you make fair points woody these are trends that have been going
[2:39:17.480 --> 2:39:26.360]  on um i i i just think that maybe the alternative is a uh a worse option than what's going on right
[2:39:26.360 --> 2:39:31.560]  now but only time will tell fair points from woody uh let's go to mary in florida go ahead mary
[2:39:32.840 --> 2:39:40.680]  hi owens hello how you doing i'm so happy i got you i've been listening to info wars since
[2:39:40.680 --> 2:39:48.840]  access television and my take on the state of the union last night it was excellent moving
[2:39:48.840 --> 2:39:58.520]  hopeful uh everything that i agree with what really got me again was watching the democrat
[2:39:58.520 --> 2:40:08.120]  sitting there not moving making snide faces uh well yeah you could hear them jeering and you
[2:40:08.120 --> 2:40:14.520]  could hear the disgust in their reaction to certain things i mean it's like wow these people are really
[2:40:14.520 --> 2:40:26.520]  sick yeah they they are so far gone that they can't see the good in anything and at the end when
[2:40:26.520 --> 2:40:33.000]  i was our every time there's a state of the union they do this so that didn't surprise me but when
[2:40:33.000 --> 2:40:43.080]  nancy polosi tore that speech in half i just about died i i i couldn't believe it well they've
[2:40:43.080 --> 2:40:49.400]  really hurt themselves politically and i just think that their ubris and arrogance and their hatred
[2:40:49.400 --> 2:40:55.000]  has blinded them so much now that they can't even see it and really they just don't care
[2:40:56.680 --> 2:41:04.200]  yes and we see this in a mic chasm in our daily lives when we deal with people like this at work
[2:41:04.200 --> 2:41:11.720]  or at school wherever um they just they're they can't see anything good about anything
[2:41:11.720 --> 2:41:20.920]  they're just horrible i was so mad i was still mad this morning i i i couldn't believe she did that
[2:41:21.640 --> 2:41:24.520]  and you know mary you you you bring up something else too
[2:41:25.560 --> 2:41:31.880]  that i think a lot of people can can relate to and you know i i remember a time in my life i think
[2:41:31.880 --> 2:41:39.160]  everybody has has times in their lives where you're basically faced with a decision to make
[2:41:39.160 --> 2:41:46.840]  internally and spiritually where you're going through a tough time and you you're not even sure
[2:41:46.840 --> 2:41:52.120]  if you can see a light at the end of the tunnel and it's easy to become overwhelmed with bitterness
[2:41:52.120 --> 2:41:57.800]  and anger and it's easy for that to consume you and make you an ugly person and and you have to
[2:41:57.800 --> 2:42:06.520]  make a conscious decision in that struggle to not have that bring you down to not have that to
[2:42:06.520 --> 2:42:13.240]  destroy you to continue to maintain and persevere and keep faith and hope in yourself people give it
[2:42:13.240 --> 2:42:18.040]  to god you know they look at their family there's all kinds of different uh resources but to me
[2:42:18.920 --> 2:42:25.800]  they've just decided to let the bitterness consume them let the hatred consume them and there's just
[2:42:25.800 --> 2:42:30.760]  for them there's just there's no coming back i think you said it right there's just no coming back
[2:42:30.760 --> 2:42:39.400]  no and it's totally ugly and it these people you can see it in them they're sick their health they
[2:42:39.400 --> 2:42:44.600]  don't look good yeah well and that's it too mary thank you so much for the call that's it too the

[2:46:52.760 --> 2:47:00.280]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[2:47:13.320 --> 2:47:21.400]  you found it the tip of the spear it is the alex jones show with oen treuer
[2:47:21.400 --> 2:47:26.360]  we're trying to take as many of your calls in response to last night state of the union
[2:47:26.360 --> 2:47:31.720]  address again i will sign off after the segment mike adams will take over but i will continue
[2:47:31.720 --> 2:47:37.720]  to take your phone calls for three hours during the war room today if you don't get in on the alex
[2:47:37.720 --> 2:47:44.760]  jones show let's go out to robert in organ go ahead robert oh and how you doing good thank you
[2:47:44.760 --> 2:47:51.560]  you good hey just a couple of points same as everybody else mostly you know i think last night
[2:47:51.560 --> 2:47:59.480]  was more than anything a big wake-up call for people to take a look at the division and make a choice
[2:48:01.720 --> 2:48:07.880]  when you look at the reactions of the entire left side from the viewpoint we had of that room
[2:48:07.880 --> 2:48:15.320]  it's disturbing you know i mean uh there there are certain basic things going on that people
[2:48:15.320 --> 2:48:23.880]  need to to be cemented and and understand the choices they make affect the future we have a
[2:48:23.880 --> 2:48:29.320]  big big election coming up and we have a lot of bad things happening and um you know people
[2:48:29.320 --> 2:48:35.480]  need to keep focused keep after the truth and decide what they want to do what they want to back
[2:48:35.480 --> 2:48:41.000]  who they're with and uh you know that's that's pretty much all i have i i think that people
[2:48:41.000 --> 2:48:44.760]  really need to take a look inside themselves and see where they want this country to go
[2:48:44.760 --> 2:48:50.120]  i mean to the points to the guy that made from i believe florida regarding the economy and stuff
[2:48:50.120 --> 2:48:55.560]  let's let this president you know have at least one hand untied to work on something he's been
[2:48:55.560 --> 2:49:02.200]  battling his own existence for three years and again you know i couldn't argue with the
[2:49:02.200 --> 2:49:09.240]  points he was making but if you look at the momentum and is the overall attitude what we
[2:49:09.240 --> 2:49:17.880]  had to ingest under obama versus trump it's just a world of difference absolutely and you know
[2:49:17.880 --> 2:49:22.040]  people need to understand that again the understanding is a big piece you know it's
[2:49:23.000 --> 2:49:27.720]  you have to put away your facebook and your instagram and you have to kind of get focused
[2:49:27.720 --> 2:49:32.520]  on some important things if you have a family if you have uh you know a career and a job you have
[2:49:32.520 --> 2:49:37.400]  to put your head down and be a productive member of this country and i think that understanding
[2:49:37.400 --> 2:49:42.040]  the way things work we can't bury our heads in the sand and pretend like we don't care or it's
[2:49:42.040 --> 2:49:48.120]  too much for us to take these are serious things and i think again the point that that hit me harder
[2:49:48.120 --> 2:49:53.160]  than anything last night was how embarrassing it is to see someone who's in their late 60s or 70s i
[2:49:53.160 --> 2:50:00.600]  don't know how old she is uh act like somebody who i mean to show that that's you know plenty of
[2:50:00.600 --> 2:50:05.000]  people tell you keep control of your emotion you know and she she can't even do that how can
[2:50:05.000 --> 2:50:09.160]  we expect her to know it's like you know it's like the kid that's like afraid there's a monster
[2:50:09.160 --> 2:50:14.360]  under the bed or whatever and the parent looks under the bed and then actually sees a monster
[2:50:15.080 --> 2:50:21.320]  and you know it's it's shocking thanks for the call robert let's go to tom in north carolina go
[2:50:21.320 --> 2:50:31.400]  ahead tom hey i'm uh pleasure to talk to you thanks for calling can you hear me yep uh yeah i uh i
[2:50:31.400 --> 2:50:36.280]  was going to just comment on the uh trump speech there's a couple other callers you had if i could
[2:50:36.280 --> 2:50:43.080]  make a a brief comment about the federal loan shark uh or reserve board with that call it
[2:50:43.080 --> 2:50:48.760]  hadn't realized but i think the banks realized not be the people understand what lion lincoln did
[2:50:48.760 --> 2:50:57.400]  it right before he invaded uh unconstitutionally the confederacy sovereign confederacy he printed
[2:50:57.400 --> 2:51:02.600]  greenbacks because the european bankers want to charge him like 30 percent interest so he
[2:51:02.600 --> 2:51:08.280]  printed greenbacks and actually next to the silver certificate he printed that was the last legal
[2:51:08.280 --> 2:51:13.000]  money in this country but trumps got that in the bag i wouldn't worry too much about that
[2:51:13.000 --> 2:51:19.800]  but uh as far as that speech went i think that one caller was right about the most entertaining
[2:51:19.800 --> 2:51:26.280]  thing about that speech was just watching nancy polos and she uh she looked like a like a junkie
[2:51:26.280 --> 2:51:31.800]  to just have her supply cut off which is i think what's really happening you know when trump dropped
[2:51:31.800 --> 2:51:38.200]  that mother of all bombs over there or opium poppy central and afghanistan and trying to shut down
[2:51:38.200 --> 2:51:45.160]  all these uh sanctuary drug densities but that's how all these democratic machines i think are funded
[2:51:45.160 --> 2:51:50.760]  is what that drug money it's like al capone had the alcohol oh yeah the drug money the human trafficking
[2:51:50.760 --> 2:51:57.320]  absolutely 110 why what why else would they be fighting to shut down ice who trump properly
[2:51:57.320 --> 2:52:02.520]  gave praise to multiple times last night exactly and that's why with every time he said something
[2:52:02.520 --> 2:52:08.920]  like that was like this just slapping slapping polosi slapping polosi space or you know but you
[2:52:08.920 --> 2:52:14.680]  know it was really just such a moment of vindication i think too for for many americans who have been
[2:52:14.680 --> 2:52:23.320]  trying to warn their fellow americans just how evil these democrats are and it was just such a
[2:52:23.320 --> 2:52:28.840]  moment of indication without even having to point the finger or say anything they just came right out
[2:52:28.840 --> 2:52:35.080]  and they just showed the evil disgusting monsters they are thanks for the call tom anthony in new
[2:52:35.080 --> 2:52:45.240]  york you're on the air go ahead hey all in i just wanted to say i like the speech because it was
[2:52:45.240 --> 2:52:51.640]  amazing and um it was just crazy out i was watching it with my mom and we were just looking at polosi's
[2:52:51.640 --> 2:52:58.680]  face and it literally looked like it was distorted like she really does look demonic and well look
[2:52:58.680 --> 2:53:04.360]  i'm gonna be perfectly honest with you i don't know what exactly uh health issues she has it's it's
[2:53:04.360 --> 2:53:10.840]  very serious she has very serious health problems and basically i'm not kidding you they they literally
[2:53:10.840 --> 2:53:15.640]  basically have to tape her nose on her face every day and if you can actually see through the
[2:53:15.640 --> 2:53:22.120]  inch of makeup she puts on you'll see there's literal pieces of tape all across her nose they
[2:53:22.120 --> 2:53:28.600]  have to basically like tape her nose on i mean this woman is very very ill and and disgusting looking
[2:53:29.240 --> 2:53:37.160]  and uh again if these people had any grace or any self-awareness at all they would be stepping off the
[2:53:37.160 --> 2:53:47.000]  stage yeah exactly and um yeah she was just like pretending to like fumble with her papers the whole
[2:53:47.000 --> 2:53:52.760]  entire time like and pretending like she was actually reading it and just like looking up in her face
[2:53:52.760 --> 2:53:58.760]  is just it just looks so weird and it was really was so childish when she ripped up the uh the speech
[2:53:58.760 --> 2:54:05.560]  at the end like it just shows how how disconnected and uh and evil they are well i think there's one
[2:54:05.560 --> 2:54:11.560]  woman celebrating in the democrat party today and that's hillary clinton because hillary clinton i mean
[2:54:11.560 --> 2:54:17.800]  as far as the average american is concerned is the biggest bitch in american political history
[2:54:17.800 --> 2:54:23.000]  i think nancy polosi may have dethroned her last night wow thanks for the call let's go to hector
[2:54:23.000 --> 2:54:30.920]  in texas go ahead hector hey owen how you doing good thank you hey i wanted to comment about that uh
[2:54:30.920 --> 2:54:42.760]  there union um i think it's kind of symbolic it almost already seemed like people had to pick a side and uh
[2:54:42.760 --> 2:54:48.280]  i don't know it's crazy you know it's getting crazy to see those people that preach that they have no
[2:54:48.280 --> 2:54:55.320]  hate in their heart and they look they look evil i mean that lady some bad lady and uh i was listening
[2:54:55.320 --> 2:55:02.520]  to that guy woody talk earlier and uh i disagree with them i just think you know you have to give
[2:55:02.520 --> 2:55:08.200]  people the ability to have a positive outlook on things and you know and not be so negative i
[2:55:08.200 --> 2:55:15.400]  didn't like trump at the beginning um i gave him a chance and i see what he's doing um and you know
[2:55:15.400 --> 2:55:20.680]  i love trump you know i come across a lot of wealthy people i'm an electrician and for some
[2:55:20.680 --> 2:55:27.640]  reason they they they almost act like they're my saviors and and they automatically assume that i hate
[2:55:27.640 --> 2:55:33.240]  trump because i'm mexican and when i tell them that i love trump they can understand that it
[2:55:33.240 --> 2:55:39.000]  it's very safe to me you know and that's the intention of all the hate trump media and the
[2:55:39.000 --> 2:55:44.680]  fake news is to try to keep americans divided which is another significant victory for the state of
[2:55:44.680 --> 2:55:51.400]  the union speech it's a unification of all americans coming together uh to love this country
[2:55:51.960 --> 2:55:56.200]  believe in our prosperity believe in our exceptionalism believe we can make it to mars
[2:55:56.760 --> 2:56:00.920]  uh and so it's a it's a unifying victory for us but you know it's kind of like this
[2:56:02.280 --> 2:56:09.000]  it's like imagine you hate a candy manufacturer so much for whatever reason you just you hate
[2:56:09.000 --> 2:56:14.920]  this candy manufacturer and you just cannot stand it and you hate it so much that on a certain day
[2:56:15.480 --> 2:56:21.480]  somebody comes up to you and says all right this may be a crude approach to this analogy but says
[2:56:21.480 --> 2:56:27.000]  okay you can either eat this candy bar from this candy company or you can literally eat a piece of
[2:56:27.000 --> 2:56:33.160]  human excrement and because they hate that candy manufacturer so much they literally eat poop and
[2:56:33.160 --> 2:56:42.520]  that's that's what the democrats chose last night yeah you know i um i you know i educate my kids
[2:56:42.520 --> 2:56:46.360]  of a lot of this stuff and i make them watch a lot of political stuff with me because i tell them
[2:56:46.360 --> 2:56:51.480]  you know that that mentality of you know we'll give you something for free if you vote our way
[2:56:51.480 --> 2:56:55.880]  i tell my kids that doesn't work you know my dad taught me how to work and it taught me through
[2:56:55.880 --> 2:57:05.320]  yeah and that's another thing too you know like people start to sit here and and somehow demonized
[2:57:05.320 --> 2:57:09.960]  trump because he talks about the youth being employed and and this stuff but no that's a good
[2:57:09.960 --> 2:57:15.800]  thing it's a good thing for for young people to understand work ethic and the value of a dollar
[2:57:16.520 --> 2:57:21.800]  and to see the taxes the democrats take from them that is a good thing hector thank you so much for
[2:57:21.800 --> 2:57:26.760]  the call all right ladies and gentlemen uh i sign off and hand the reins over to mike adams i will

[3:00:18.200 --> 3:00:24.840]  we are going to be taking your calls today however we want to focus exclusively on the
[3:00:24.840 --> 3:00:30.680]  corona virus pandemic i have a lot of new information i'll be breaking this hour on the show
[3:00:30.680 --> 3:00:36.440]  but i'd like you to call in if you have information about this pandemic what's happening locally or
[3:00:36.440 --> 3:00:42.520]  regionally things that you are seeing especially if you're a healthcare worker or a first responder
[3:00:42.520 --> 3:00:55.080]  call us at 877-789-2539 again that's 877-789-2539 calls only about the corona virus pandemic
[3:00:55.080 --> 3:01:01.240]  i apologize to the callers who were holding about the state of the union address that's not the
[3:01:01.240 --> 3:01:06.840]  topic of this hour even though some great callers last hour i really enjoyed listening to owen and
[3:01:06.840 --> 3:01:11.240]  many of the callers and the points raised by the callers as well but this hour is going to be
[3:01:11.240 --> 3:01:17.800]  the corona virus pandemic and we have a lot of very important information breaking now about that
[3:01:17.800 --> 3:01:24.120]  this morning zero hedge rolled out an article that we have confirmed through our sources in
[3:01:24.120 --> 3:01:32.360]  taiwan we published it now it seems to suggest that the actual number of infections may be 155
[3:01:32.360 --> 3:01:38.600]  thousand according to the chinese government's own secret statistics and that the deaths from
[3:01:38.600 --> 3:01:46.680]  this corona virus pandemic in china alone may be approaching 25 000 and as we continue the show here
[3:01:46.680 --> 3:01:52.040]  today in this hour i will explain exactly where those possible numbers are coming from it seems
[3:01:52.040 --> 3:01:59.320]  to be that china has two sets of data one set is being recorded privately in their own databases
[3:01:59.320 --> 3:02:04.280]  but then there's a second set of data that's much lower numbers that's being given to the public
[3:02:04.280 --> 3:02:10.520]  we will cover that also today some more highlights from the francis boil interview
[3:02:11.320 --> 3:02:18.120]  that ova schreuer conducted last hour there is a lot of important information from francis boil
[3:02:18.120 --> 3:02:23.080]  that we need to get into about the biological weapons program and how it's proceeding in the
[3:02:23.080 --> 3:02:29.720]  united states and even how 9 11 was a type of cover in order to relaunch biological weapons
[3:02:29.720 --> 3:02:37.400]  development in america also as we publish on natural news today it appears that the who
[3:02:37.400 --> 3:02:43.240]  wants the pandemic to succeed i'll get into that story today as well and what i mean by that is
[3:02:43.240 --> 3:02:49.080]  they are actively encouraging all countries to stop blocking flights and passengers from china
[3:02:49.880 --> 3:02:56.920]  they seem to want the who seems to want this pandemic to spread and today on the show here
[3:02:56.920 --> 3:03:03.320]  i will be talking about why that is the big theory here depopulation why would the world health
[3:03:03.320 --> 3:03:09.640]  authority be quote up to their eyeballs in bio weapons research according to francis boil
[3:03:09.640 --> 3:03:15.480]  why would they want the pandemic to spread why would they not want countries to defend their
[3:03:15.480 --> 3:03:21.560]  borders against this outbreak we'll get into those reasons you may already know some of the answers
[3:03:21.560 --> 3:03:29.400]  yourself also some of the videos coming out of china appear to depict that the payload of this
[3:03:29.400 --> 3:03:35.080]  virus is almost acting like a nerve agent i'm not saying it is a nerve agent but the symptoms and
[3:03:35.080 --> 3:03:41.160]  the sudden deaths that are occurring among people who are infected appear to be to have
[3:03:41.160 --> 3:03:46.280]  such a sudden rapid onset that it's like they were attacked by a nerve agent some people are
[3:03:46.280 --> 3:03:52.280]  are going into paralysis and death apparently in less than 60 seconds and this is why people are dying
[3:03:52.280 --> 3:04:00.280]  all over the streets sidewalks in china and why those videos are leaking online we also have
[3:04:00.920 --> 3:04:07.000]  quotes today from an expert that i will be reading an infectious disease expert who says
[3:04:07.000 --> 3:04:12.600]  this is going to go global this cannot be contained at this point it's eventually going to get into
[3:04:12.600 --> 3:04:18.760]  every country in the world and wouldn't you know it just as the cdc was sort of celebrating no new
[3:04:18.760 --> 3:04:25.480]  infections for a few days wisconsin just confirmed the 12th case in the united states that's right
[3:04:25.480 --> 3:04:31.880]  the 12th case of confirmed coronavirus infection in wisconsin today which brings up a huge
[3:04:31.880 --> 3:04:37.720]  assortment of questions how did it get to wisconsin and why wasn't it diagnosed earlier and who else
[3:04:37.720 --> 3:04:42.360]  has not yet been tested we'll cover all these questions plus your calls and more as we continue
[3:04:42.360 --> 3:04:45.240]  here on the alex jones show be back in 60 seconds
[3:04:52.440 --> 3:04:57.880]  well it's here the year 2020 world government's out in the open we've got the predicted mass
[3:04:57.880 --> 3:05:02.040]  pandemics and they're calling for global government as the answer and we've got massive
[3:05:02.040 --> 3:05:08.360]  huge censorship taking place it's coordinated by big tech and banks against people that promote
[3:05:08.360 --> 3:05:15.640]  america and guns and freedom and jesus and the family and the protection of the unborn wow yes
[3:05:15.640 --> 3:05:20.440]  now we know we're right the new world order is real satanism is real the pedophile leader real
[3:05:20.440 --> 3:05:25.080]  but we're real as well and we love god and we're standing up and saying no but i just want to make
[3:05:25.080 --> 3:05:30.600]  the point here one month into 2020 that we have never been in Kansas we have never been in some
[3:05:30.600 --> 3:05:36.360]  smallville place that didn't matter everything we do every decision we make governs the future of our
[3:05:36.360 --> 3:05:39.880]  species and everything we've gone through and everything we're gonna go through so it's an
[3:05:39.880 --> 3:05:44.280]  incredible town to be alive i'm gonna thank you all for being aware and being involved but just
[3:05:44.280 --> 3:05:49.880]  remember your action now via prayer word of mouth and financial support of m4 short com
[3:05:49.880 --> 3:05:58.840]  is critical so please take action leading a frontal assault on the lies of the new world
[3:05:58.840 --> 3:06:07.960]  or it's alex jones with mike adam's we wake up in the morning and the light is mike adam's here
[3:06:07.960 --> 3:06:12.760]  continuing the fourth hour thank you for joining us if you're just joining us this hour will focus
[3:06:12.760 --> 3:06:18.360]  entirely on the coronavirus pandemic we have new analysis new information some of it coming from
[3:06:18.920 --> 3:06:25.720]  my staff members we have an office in taiwan many of you know my wife is taiwanese i speak
[3:06:25.720 --> 3:06:29.400]  mandarin chinese even though i don't read the language because i didn't memorize all those
[3:06:29.400 --> 3:06:34.600]  symbols but i i do i do speak it i lived in asia we have staff on the ground we're getting a lot
[3:06:34.600 --> 3:06:39.320]  of good information and confirmations of information that's being reported by other sources i'll be
[3:06:39.320 --> 3:06:45.720]  bringing that to you today we're also going to be taking your calls and we're going to go shortly
[3:06:45.720 --> 3:06:50.920]  not right this instant but johnny and denmark stay on the line i'm going to go to you next i just
[3:06:50.920 --> 3:06:57.320]  want to say before we get into the calls and into the full details of this hour my job and my
[3:06:57.880 --> 3:07:07.320]  intention here is to be as as authentic and honest and upfront with you as possible as this pandemic
[3:07:07.320 --> 3:07:16.280]  is spreading and i have i sort of have to apologize i have been i think too conservative i think i've
[3:07:16.280 --> 3:07:22.120]  i've i've tried not to talk about the bigger numbers that i know to be true and so i have
[3:07:22.120 --> 3:07:29.160]  been reporting the official chinese numbers which i know to be lies and that's it's because we couldn't
[3:07:29.160 --> 3:07:35.080]  cite other numbers what other source is out there that we can cite and so we don't want to go with
[3:07:35.080 --> 3:07:40.600]  numbers that we can't confirm and that's why i've been very conservative about this uh also you know
[3:07:40.600 --> 3:07:47.000]  of course we don't we don't want to put numbers out there if we can't back them up but now from
[3:07:47.000 --> 3:07:52.280]  multiple sources we have so many layers of confirmation that the chinese government is lying
[3:07:52.280 --> 3:07:59.320]  and more importantly that the who is in the pocket of the chinese the who is lying the who
[3:07:59.320 --> 3:08:06.760]  in my assessment wants this pandemic to spread i will be covering that today and i assure you from
[3:08:06.760 --> 3:08:12.200]  this point forward i'm going to go ahead and mention my my assessment of where these numbers
[3:08:12.200 --> 3:08:18.360]  really are i'll qualify them and say this is my assessment this is my opinion you know as a published
[3:08:18.360 --> 3:08:24.200]  scientist as a researcher as an independent journalist there may never be official sources
[3:08:24.920 --> 3:08:31.800]  that tell the true story because from what i'm hearing china is executing citizens who show
[3:08:31.800 --> 3:08:37.560]  infections and the reason that they're executing them is number one then they don't have to report
[3:08:37.560 --> 3:08:43.560]  them as being infected they're no longer infected they're dead and then once they're dead what's the
[3:08:43.560 --> 3:08:49.320]  cause of death well a bullet it wasn't coronavirus it was a bullet so gosh what do you know the
[3:08:49.320 --> 3:08:54.920]  pandemic's not that bad as long as china shoots all the infected citizens so i'm hearing from
[3:08:54.920 --> 3:08:58.920]  multiple sources that that's exactly what is going on in china now we're talking about
[3:08:58.920 --> 3:09:08.280]  a kind of a a holocaust in the making here mass deaths mass graves i'm being told that the cremation
[3:09:08.280 --> 3:09:14.920]  vans are running 24 7 in china people are being kidnapped off the streets and stuffed into cremation
[3:09:14.920 --> 3:09:24.120]  vans and taken to ovens so yes i am i am invoking the imagery the horrifying history of the third
[3:09:24.120 --> 3:09:28.920]  rike we're not there yet in terms of numbers but the tactics appear to be the same from
[3:09:28.920 --> 3:09:34.760]  communist china people are being treated treated as prisoners this is a crime against humanity this
[3:09:34.760 --> 3:09:40.680]  is a prison camp situation the so-called hospitals are nothing but quarantine prison camps this is
[3:09:40.680 --> 3:09:49.000]  very bad we're being lied to by china we're being lied to by the who and i apologize that i haven't
[3:09:49.000 --> 3:09:55.160]  mentioned the higher numbers earlier the numbers that i i'm very certain are true so that that's
[3:09:55.160 --> 3:10:00.920]  my commitment to you today uh this it's a it's a massive cover up out there and humanity is going
[3:10:00.920 --> 3:10:05.080]  to pay the price if we don't get on top of this very quickly we are the voices that are warning
[3:10:05.080 --> 3:10:10.280]  humanity and we are the voices that need to be heard and yet we are the voices that of course
[3:10:10.280 --> 3:10:15.400]  are being silenced now with with that preamble out of the way let's go to johnny and denmark who
[3:10:15.400 --> 3:10:20.840]  who apparently has some comments about about aids and this pandemic johnny you're on with mike
[3:10:20.840 --> 3:10:26.760]  adams go ahead welcome to the show hi mike glad to finally talk to you i've been following you
[3:10:26.760 --> 3:10:31.000]  for a long time we're actually friends on facebook and i especially enjoyed your
[3:10:32.680 --> 3:10:38.520]  conversation with uh dr steve patchenek um i don't know how much you you listen to have
[3:10:38.520 --> 3:10:43.880]  given how busy you are researching um the corona virus i don't know how uh to what extent you're
[3:10:43.880 --> 3:10:49.160]  able to listen to the calls on the other shows but on all three shows uh i told them you were my
[3:10:49.160 --> 3:10:54.600]  pick for the world's leading expert on the at least publicly available information on this
[3:10:54.600 --> 3:10:59.880]  particular corona virus and with all due respect to steve for which i have a lot he's a poly map
[3:10:59.880 --> 3:11:05.960]  in his own right but on this particular corona virus um i i think you politely reputed him
[3:11:05.960 --> 3:11:11.480]  um well i i thank you for your comments and i i agree that i have great respect for for dr
[3:11:11.480 --> 3:11:17.240]  patchenek and uh i don't know how he and i got wrapped up in an unintentional debate actually it
[3:11:17.240 --> 3:11:21.720]  sort of organically formed but thank you for your comments my my goal has always been to give you
[3:11:21.720 --> 3:11:25.960]  the most accurate information possible not always right 100 but that's my goal but but go ahead i
[3:11:25.960 --> 3:11:32.360]  didn't mean to interrupt no problem uh actually the seven people um i most want to hear from about
[3:11:32.360 --> 3:11:37.720]  it beforehand uh actually eight people were you nick uh begge alex jones david night uh
[3:11:37.720 --> 3:11:42.760]  steve patchenek and this is before i heard him right john rapaport owens shroyer and uh davon
[3:11:42.760 --> 3:11:47.560]  the x22 report which has some pretty good coverage and the only one i haven't heard from so far was
[3:11:47.560 --> 3:11:53.080]  nick begge uh but anyway um i don't know if you you heard though my call to uh the david night
[3:11:53.080 --> 3:11:58.280]  show my first ever last week but um just to remind us of things that have happened before which
[3:11:58.280 --> 3:12:03.640]  are relevant i think age is particularly relevant i formulated this acronym which i think is very
[3:12:03.640 --> 3:12:10.840]  apt because it's sleaze which is sars legionnaires disease ebola aid deca and e coli not dismissed
[3:12:10.840 --> 3:12:17.480]  the severity of this however i don't know if you've read this fantastic book uh on aids written by
[3:12:17.480 --> 3:12:26.120]  rebecca coleshow on 2007 um titled science sold out does hiv really cause aids and uh spoiler
[3:12:26.120 --> 3:12:31.400]  alert the answer is no um and she makes a very good scientific case she's actually an insider
[3:12:31.400 --> 3:12:37.080]  she was a world's leading researcher on aids and she quit in disgust on age research because it was
[3:12:37.080 --> 3:12:42.920]  it was the virus that um wasn't properly identified there wasn't even an electron micrograph for it
[3:12:42.920 --> 3:12:51.240]  so the ultimate answer was that um it's the hiv aids hypothesis uh was false in the sense that uh
[3:12:51.240 --> 3:12:57.880]  hiv was not properly isolated and aids didn't exist in the sense that uh many senses but one very
[3:12:57.880 --> 3:13:03.960]  telling one is that the vast majority of so-called aids patients die of you probably know this
[3:13:03.960 --> 3:13:10.040]  liver failure which is not one of the 30 associated uh diseases uh and the reason they die of liver
[3:13:10.040 --> 3:13:15.480]  failure is the medications that they're given um well i've i've heard this before uh yeah i've
[3:13:15.480 --> 3:13:20.920]  heard this before and i've also read books by uh dr gary null who who talks about this as well
[3:13:21.640 --> 3:13:27.320]  just to be clear as i understand it you know we're not we're not denying the existence of aids what
[3:13:27.320 --> 3:13:35.000]  we're saying is that acquired immune deficiency syndrome has many other causes but uh that perhaps
[3:13:35.000 --> 3:13:40.840]  that virus is not the only cause there there's needle sharing you know there's uh sharing of
[3:13:42.200 --> 3:13:48.840]  deadly viruses through anal anal intercourse frankly across the gay community anal cancer
[3:13:48.840 --> 3:13:54.200]  is on the rise in that community i i get your point uh let's bring this back to corona virus
[3:13:54.200 --> 3:14:00.520]  though that's the topic right now what how does this relate to that right i there were certain
[3:14:00.520 --> 3:14:05.720]  lessons learned uh from the aids i would call it little pandemic and with all due respect to you
[3:14:05.720 --> 3:14:10.680]  and believe me i have a lot i think if you read rebecca coleslaw's book you will have some serious
[3:14:10.680 --> 3:14:16.200]  doubts about whether aids really does exist as a valid diagnostic category just for example
[3:14:16.200 --> 3:14:20.520]  the growth curve there's supposed to be this huge growth curve and it's supposed to be a pandemic
[3:14:20.520 --> 3:14:26.200]  and it is at its state constant uh at one per mil in other words point one percent until they
[3:14:26.200 --> 3:14:30.040]  raised the medication that it went up to one point one percent and they lowered the medication
[3:14:30.040 --> 3:14:36.200]  and they went back to one point one percent um interesting so i mean it yeah yeah i would i would
[3:14:36.200 --> 3:14:41.160]  really it's an easy read especially for someone of your scientific background and i would hardly
[3:14:41.160 --> 3:14:46.360]  recommend that you read it anyway i will absolutely i will check that out we've only got one minute
[3:14:46.360 --> 3:14:51.720]  before break so so jump right into it go ahead i can i can i can speak quickly um now the three
[3:14:51.720 --> 3:14:57.080]  lessons learned i will one the mainstream media and almost unbelievably pathogen exaggerating
[3:14:57.800 --> 3:15:04.760]  medical pharmaceutical conspiracy or whatever um complex are almost unbelievably corrupt lying
[3:15:04.760 --> 3:15:10.520]  in unapologetic branches of the nwo the second one is that's a good news for everybody immunity
[3:15:10.520 --> 3:15:17.000]  comes pathogen i mean 0.1 uh even the case of age which is so dreaded uh 0.1 percent that's right
[3:15:17.000 --> 3:15:24.680]  mill is not a lot not a lot and three is exposing the uh corrupt medical pharmaceutical conspiracy
[3:15:24.680 --> 3:15:31.640]  or complex is dangerous even for Nobel science uh prize laureate uh about their um about the
[3:15:31.640 --> 3:15:37.960]  research area of expertise for example luke amontanier who is uh given the Nobel prize
[3:15:37.960 --> 3:15:43.480]  for isolating the virus johnny we gotta we gotta go to break uh sorry i'm rough you got most your
[3:15:43.480 --> 3:15:47.560]  points in but we're going to break here a great great call good information we'll be back after
[3:15:47.560 --> 3:15:53.480]  this break with more of your calls and more breaking news stay with us hi i'm dan pilla i started
[3:15:53.480 --> 3:15:58.360]  fighting the irs over 40 years ago when they tried to seize my mother's house i sued the irs in one

[3:17:54.680 --> 3:18:01.720]  why the servants of satan hate info wars it's because we're awake we're alive we're passionate
[3:18:01.720 --> 3:18:08.200]  and we're not giving up that's why it's critical for those of us that are aware of the new order's
[3:18:08.200 --> 3:18:14.600]  plans to not get down when they attack us and they persecute us and they lie about us that's what we
[3:18:14.600 --> 3:18:20.680]  should expect because we are hurting these scumbags the globalists have literally sold their soul to
[3:18:20.680 --> 3:18:26.360]  the dark side and they do what they do because they're slaves because they are eternally driven to
[3:18:26.360 --> 3:18:32.840]  try to suppress and dominate and destroy the innocent it is up to us who are awake not the sheep
[3:18:32.840 --> 3:18:40.680]  and not the wolves but the sheep dogs to stand firm and resist these wicked tyrants they fear the
[3:18:40.680 --> 3:18:48.200]  fact that we are awake they fear the fact that we are alive they fear the fact that we love god
[3:18:48.200 --> 3:18:54.360]  and that's all we ever have to know is that god is in charge there's a lot of phony garbage out
[3:18:54.360 --> 3:18:59.960]  there in the world a lot of people that never deliver well i'm here to tell you info wars
[3:18:59.960 --> 3:19:07.800]  has delivered in royal flush in a handful of ace of spades because of god because of the
[3:19:07.800 --> 3:19:13.720]  audience of activists and because of the great team at info wars and we're all a team ladies and
[3:19:13.720 --> 3:19:19.640]  gentlemen so right now humanity's awakening is explosive it's powerful it's incredible but there
[3:19:19.640 --> 3:19:25.080]  is major obstacles coming down the road and the only way we can effectively fight the nwo and stay
[3:19:25.080 --> 3:19:30.040]  in the game like info wars has to tip the spear is your financial support we make it really easy
[3:19:30.040 --> 3:19:35.880]  and then fullwarestore.com but i am blowing through our backup money right now with our
[3:19:35.880 --> 3:19:40.760]  reporters doing triple the work they ever have because they volunteered to do it and oan and the
[3:19:40.760 --> 3:19:46.040]  rest of crew will fight 18 hours a day seven days a week during this election year that's so critical
[3:19:46.040 --> 3:19:51.960]  but they need the financing to put them in the field go to info wars.com and fight for your own future
[3:19:56.120 --> 3:19:58.760]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[3:19:58.760 --> 3:20:14.760]  big brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he it's mike adams
[3:20:17.080 --> 3:20:21.560]  all right more breaking news on the coronavirus pandemic today let's talk about the so-called
[3:20:21.560 --> 3:20:28.600]  leaked numbers from china it appears that china has two sets of data on the number of infected
[3:20:28.600 --> 3:20:36.120]  patients and the number of dead now this leaked out of an official chinese government website that
[3:20:36.120 --> 3:20:43.640]  publishes the official data which many experts around the world believe that uh that those data
[3:20:43.640 --> 3:20:51.240]  are artificially low you know the official data that says it's what 24 000 something and and uh
[3:20:51.240 --> 3:21:00.840]  what 400 something deaths right now 494 the real numbers may be much much higher as high as 154
[3:21:00.840 --> 3:21:08.040]  000 infections and nearly 25 000 deaths and the way that this is being discovered is that this
[3:21:08.040 --> 3:21:14.680]  official website accidentally published these higher numbers for a few minutes and then reverted
[3:21:14.680 --> 3:21:19.240]  them back to the lower numbers but as the higher numbers were published the way we know that it
[3:21:19.240 --> 3:21:24.840]  wasn't a typo is because above each of these numbers is another number that shows the growth
[3:21:24.840 --> 3:21:30.520]  from yesterday from the previous day and it's even explained with chinese characters this is the
[3:21:30.520 --> 3:21:35.400]  the difference from yesterday and they were showing for deaths for example i think it was
[3:21:35.400 --> 3:21:45.160]  plus 1546 and for infections it was plus 20 979 so what this shows is that there's an algorithm
[3:21:45.160 --> 3:21:50.760]  that's calculating the difference from the day before and as an engineer myself you know i run
[3:21:50.760 --> 3:21:54.840]  software teams i i build systems like you know i built bright town dot com or at least my team
[3:21:54.840 --> 3:22:00.440]  did and i i ran the team and so on i understand what this was was the database that's running this
[3:22:00.440 --> 3:22:07.480]  site temporarily connected to the wrong database table i.e the second set of data so china has
[3:22:07.480 --> 3:22:13.800]  two sets of books you know just like a a mafia organization would have one you know one set of
[3:22:13.800 --> 3:22:21.160]  books of all their their prostitution and gang you know extortion money or whatever drug trade money
[3:22:21.160 --> 3:22:25.240]  and then they would have a public set of books oh we're just a restaurant or a laundromat or
[3:22:25.240 --> 3:22:32.200]  whatever uh china appears to have two sets of books now it's impossible to ever get a confirmation
[3:22:32.200 --> 3:22:38.600]  of this from china because of course they are lying and the WHO is lying but there are some clues
[3:22:38.600 --> 3:22:44.760]  that underscore this for example china is right now adding more hospital bed capacity
[3:22:45.320 --> 3:22:50.920]  and according to the asian media that was translated to me this morning china is now
[3:22:50.920 --> 3:22:58.360]  saying they need 100 000 more hospital beds that number is consistent with a huge number of
[3:22:58.360 --> 3:23:05.480]  infections such as 154 000 that that appeared to have leaked out those numbers are probably even
[3:23:05.480 --> 3:23:09.960]  low the new leaked numbers are probably low because of course the chinese government
[3:23:09.960 --> 3:23:15.640]  doesn't even have internally in its own secret database it doesn't even have the full extent
[3:23:15.640 --> 3:23:20.040]  of the infections and the deaths fully recorded for all the reasons that we've mentioned already
[3:23:20.040 --> 3:23:25.400]  for example the number of deaths is artificially low because china is executing some people
[3:23:26.040 --> 3:23:30.280]  and then not counting them as coronavirus deaths the number of infections is artificially low
[3:23:30.280 --> 3:23:35.720]  because many of the infections are diagnosed as something different we also know from multiple
[3:23:35.720 --> 3:23:42.360]  sources including the epoch times that has sources that are high level people inside the
[3:23:42.360 --> 3:23:47.960]  communist party in china we know that there has been artificial scarcity of the diagnostic kits
[3:23:48.520 --> 3:23:54.360]  created so that there can't be tests of everyone and every time we hear stories of people going
[3:23:54.360 --> 3:23:59.000]  to the hospitals there to try to get tested we hear that they're being turned away from the
[3:23:59.000 --> 3:24:06.040]  hospitals they're sent home to die and so we know that china isn't testing everybody who's infected
[3:24:06.040 --> 3:24:11.800]  and this leads me to now a new assessment that i'll share with you this is my opinion this was not
[3:24:11.800 --> 3:24:17.720]  infowars opinion or alex jones opinion this is my opinion last week i said my best guess was that
[3:24:17.720 --> 3:24:24.520]  there were 100 000 infections in china today my current belief my best assessment is that there
[3:24:24.520 --> 3:24:32.040]  are between 200 000 and 250 000 infected people in china and that's just based on multiple sources i
[3:24:32.040 --> 3:24:37.240]  can't cite any official source we will never be able to cite an official source but i think right
[3:24:37.240 --> 3:24:42.280]  now today we could be looking at a quarter of a million infected people in china and infections
[3:24:42.280 --> 3:24:48.120]  are spreading outside the country we now have numbers growing every day in thailand in japan
[3:24:48.120 --> 3:24:53.080]  in singapore malaysia and other countries in fact there was a quarantine cruise ship just off the
[3:24:53.080 --> 3:24:59.320]  coast of japan confirmed to have at least 10 cases of infections which means that probably
[3:24:59.320 --> 3:25:04.280]  everybody on that ship i think it was 3 500 passengers roughly in that range probably
[3:25:04.280 --> 3:25:09.640]  every one of them has been exposed and we will see a lot more positive infections confirmed in the
[3:25:09.640 --> 3:25:16.760]  days ahead now uh we're going to go to some calls now mike in kentucky i hope you're still on the
[3:25:16.760 --> 3:25:22.920]  line i'm told you have an interesting call about the the situation what's happening there locally
[3:25:22.920 --> 3:25:26.920]  mike in kentucky if you're with us you're live on the air with mike adams here go ahead sir
[3:25:27.720 --> 3:25:33.880]  and mike i had some information i wanted to pass along to you regarding our immediate region is
[3:25:33.880 --> 3:25:40.200]  is just now starting to see a wave of of respiratory and flu like conditions but listen in regard to
[3:25:40.200 --> 3:25:47.000]  the aging plum island animal bio research facility in new york that is being replaced by the uh
[3:25:47.000 --> 3:25:53.000]  national bio and agro defense facility at the kansas state university and uh that's public
[3:25:53.000 --> 3:25:58.360]  knowledge on that site that site is built that site is up and running now and will completely
[3:25:58.360 --> 3:26:05.400]  phase out plum island by 2023 it's a level four laboratory and the husband and wife team that are
[3:26:05.400 --> 3:26:10.440]  there are doctors that worked with the bowler research in connection with fort detrick and
[3:26:10.440 --> 3:26:17.640]  they're also post uh 9 11 uh wrote the big purple book which is a epidemiology research
[3:26:17.640 --> 3:26:22.840]  type of book but it's a level four lab and uh one thing short now i'll get off of here
[3:26:23.400 --> 3:26:28.120]  is that the darpa p3 program that has been playing with the coronavirus has a civilian
[3:26:28.120 --> 3:26:34.280]  counterpart in this abscilla company and an abscilla representative released about a couple
[3:26:34.280 --> 3:26:40.440]  weeks ago that they were uh they were working on this and her statement is this is just the virus we
[3:26:40.440 --> 3:26:47.640]  were working on so it's just two this is just the virus we were working on is that you broke up there
[3:26:47.640 --> 3:26:51.560]  this is just the virus we were working on is that the is that your your quote that's what you were
[3:26:51.560 --> 3:26:57.960]  saying yeah you'd have to check the abscilla site but their press release has uh uh to affect that
[3:26:57.960 --> 3:27:02.120]  this is just the type of thing we were waiting for this is just the type of thing we've been
[3:27:02.120 --> 3:27:08.120]  doing so i really appreciate i'm a new listener and i appreciate your research i i'm a retired
[3:27:08.120 --> 3:27:12.600]  cryptologist but i have a strong interest still in uh tech and bio research you know
[3:27:13.560 --> 3:27:18.440]  that's fascinating uh if if you're into cryptographic research then you know all about
[3:27:18.440 --> 3:27:24.280]  secrets and you know you know all about uh sort of asymmetrical information which is what's
[3:27:24.280 --> 3:27:29.240]  happening right now the chinese government knows lots of things but the they're they're only sending
[3:27:29.240 --> 3:27:34.520]  a very small portion out to the public and the public is being deceived by the media by the tech
[3:27:34.520 --> 3:27:40.440]  giants as well as the governments themselves a great call thank you mike in kentucky i appreciate
[3:27:40.440 --> 3:27:45.000]  that we're going to continue to take calls even though we only have a short minute left here but
[3:27:45.000 --> 3:27:51.160]  let's go to lauren in ohio and we'll continue with you lauren after the break but go ahead and
[3:27:51.160 --> 3:27:55.720]  and give us the you know the opening statement of what you're calling about and welcome to the show lauren

[3:33:20.760 --> 3:33:30.600]  show just as the fukushima disaster several years ago exposed the danger that the uh the nuclear
[3:33:30.600 --> 3:33:36.040]  industry posed to humanity and we're still paying the price for that and we will be paying that price
[3:33:36.040 --> 3:33:43.560]  for centuries by the way this pandemic outbreak of an engineered biological weapon is showing how
[3:33:43.560 --> 3:33:51.320]  that area of weapons research bio warfare offensive weapons as uh francis boil has said
[3:33:51.320 --> 3:33:59.480]  how that is a grave danger to humanity and unlike nuclear weapons this is a self-replicating weapon
[3:33:59.480 --> 3:34:06.680]  system once it's released into the wild you can't control it you can't recall it in fact it takes on
[3:34:06.680 --> 3:34:09.960]  a life of its own and it begins to mutate and that's already happening and we're going to go
[3:34:09.960 --> 3:34:15.640]  back to our caller lauren here in in just a second but let me let me get you some of these just
[3:34:15.640 --> 3:34:19.560]  bombshell headlines this is just some of what we're covering today my own my own staff and
[3:34:19.560 --> 3:34:25.160]  reporters uh the coronavirus is already mutating as it jumps from person to person human to human
[3:34:25.160 --> 3:34:31.960]  transmission is causing an adaptive response quote viral evolution and it may make vaccines
[3:34:31.960 --> 3:34:39.160]  pointless that's already on the books the united nations who chief sides with communist china
[3:34:39.160 --> 3:34:44.920]  while blasting the free world for creating a stigma over the coronavirus spread so if you
[3:34:44.920 --> 3:34:51.320]  believe there's a pandemic you're a racist just just imagine that just just imagine that you're
[3:34:51.320 --> 3:34:56.600]  you must hate chinese people for being chinese even if you're just commenting about the pandemic
[3:34:56.600 --> 3:35:00.760]  and the the communist chinese cover-up this is this is what they use when obama was president
[3:35:00.760 --> 3:35:07.240]  you couldn't criticize obama on his policies because he was black which makes no sense we were
[3:35:07.240 --> 3:35:13.560]  never attacking his race we're attacking his hatred for america okay one more headline and
[3:35:13.560 --> 3:35:19.880]  then we'll go to lauren the secretary general of the who says that western nations are withholding
[3:35:19.880 --> 3:35:25.400]  coronavirus outbreak data and the mainstream media is blacklisting that news to keep the
[3:35:25.400 --> 3:35:31.800]  public in the dark as the pandemic spreads the who's official position now is that china is telling
[3:35:31.800 --> 3:35:38.760]  the truth america is lying there's really not a pandemic according to the who now even though
[3:35:38.760 --> 3:35:44.680]  they declared a global emergency just a few days earlier and that there should be no travel
[3:35:44.680 --> 3:35:49.560]  restrictions now on chinese people that chinese should be able to freely enter every country
[3:35:49.560 --> 3:35:53.960]  right now anywhere in the world even if they flew straight out of uhan even if they're coughing
[3:35:53.960 --> 3:36:00.200]  whatever just let them go everywhere according to the who and that you're a racist if you try to
[3:36:00.200 --> 3:36:07.160]  control your border where have we heard this before from the democrats attacking trump of course so
[3:36:07.160 --> 3:36:13.720]  now border control to stop a pandemic is now a racist response according to the who that's
[3:36:13.720 --> 3:36:18.600]  that's how political correctness is going to get us killed frankly this that's how
[3:36:18.600 --> 3:36:25.160]  virtue signaling is going to kill people because these these lunatics they want a virtue signal
[3:36:25.160 --> 3:36:31.080]  instead of dealing with the pandemic now let's go back to lauren in ohio who who just told us
[3:36:31.080 --> 3:36:34.840]  about this micro plasma research but lauren go ahead you have you had a fascinating introduction
[3:36:34.840 --> 3:36:38.760]  what what was your main point that you wanted to get to i just have to go back to what you were
[3:36:38.760 --> 3:36:43.800]  saying amen to that that's a four step program obey god ten little commandments keep your money in
[3:36:43.800 --> 3:36:48.360]  your pocket don't pay taxes you don't know figure out whether you owe or not keep your children in
[3:36:48.360 --> 3:36:52.760]  your home meaning control their education don't let these people lie to them and boycott big business
[3:36:52.760 --> 3:36:58.040]  we we don't need to be doing business with these giant impersonal you know you talk to a robot you
[3:36:58.040 --> 3:37:02.360]  know companies we need to go back to your neighbor to neighbor but you know doing things together
[3:37:02.360 --> 3:37:09.240]  being human 3d human 3d interface and let these computers go but okay so with regard to the age
[3:37:09.240 --> 3:37:13.880]  the gentleman was talking about the age virus and there is no age virus i want to read you
[3:37:13.880 --> 3:37:18.840]  something from this micro plasma paper okay so many plans many doctors don't know about this
[3:37:18.840 --> 3:37:23.560]  micro plasma disease agent because it was developed by the u.s military and biological warfare
[3:37:23.560 --> 3:37:29.560]  experimentation and was not made public the path patent excuse me the pathogen was patented
[3:37:29.560 --> 3:37:37.000]  by the u.s military doctor and dr shai ching low um but the i believe that's five two four two
[3:37:37.000 --> 3:37:44.120]  eight two zero if i'm not mistaken 89 page patent on a page 87 a list of all the diseases caused by
[3:37:44.120 --> 3:37:51.080]  this micro plasma which expresses itself depending on your individual dna and whether or not your
[3:37:51.080 --> 3:37:56.840]  rundown this is a weapon and here's the part that's important with regard to the age the special
[3:37:56.840 --> 3:38:02.680]  virus cancer program created by the cia and the national institutes felt and i8 to develop a deadly
[3:38:02.680 --> 3:38:07.960]  pathogen for which humanity had no natural immunity eight was disguised as a war on cancer
[3:38:07.960 --> 3:38:12.600]  but was actually part of mk may only many members of the senate and house represents
[3:38:12.600 --> 3:38:17.800]  anyway it's it's it's in that paper that i'm saying just go and take a look at it and what you'll
[3:38:17.800 --> 3:38:24.040]  see is aid when they were saying there's two structural proteins of aid with regard to this
[3:38:24.040 --> 3:38:31.080]  coronavirus you may want to look and see are you looking at micro plasma see everything doesn't
[3:38:31.080 --> 3:38:36.520]  have the docking site like the the docking site kills black people and brown people what they do
[3:38:36.520 --> 3:38:41.560]  they let it loose in africa everywhere bill gates again has been super imposing map of where they've
[3:38:41.560 --> 3:38:46.120]  done the vaccine and where the population happens it's under the age of 21 because everybody's dead
[3:38:46.840 --> 3:38:52.040]  you know you're you're linking to a big global truth about this and and by the way your call has
[3:38:52.040 --> 3:38:56.360]  been awesome there lauren uh we're we're looking at your document right now but a big global truth
[3:38:56.360 --> 3:39:02.360]  about this is that bio weapons research has always gone hand in hand with global depopulation
[3:39:02.360 --> 3:39:06.200]  agendas and we know who's behind that we know who's funding it and we know why
[3:39:06.200 --> 3:39:11.240]  they're trying to do it they hate humanity these are the same globalists that are pushing abortion
[3:39:11.240 --> 3:39:18.760]  infanticide destruction of the family they're pushing hatred against men uh as as if being male
[3:39:18.760 --> 3:39:23.160]  is is bad and they're saying that there should be no more mothers and fathers i mean this is an
[3:39:23.160 --> 3:39:28.360]  anti-human agenda and biological weapons is just one of the forms that this takes so thank you for
[3:39:28.360 --> 3:39:32.200]  your call lauren that's that's really fantastic uh let me bring in something else here then we're
[3:39:32.200 --> 3:39:40.920]  going to go to one more call in this segment here we go we have an expert now amesh adadja a senior
[3:39:40.920 --> 3:39:46.520]  scholar at john hopkins university center for health security and a spokesperson for the infectious
[3:39:46.520 --> 3:39:54.040]  diseases society of america he says quote it's not a matter of if it's a matter of when there is
[3:39:54.760 --> 3:40:02.120]  not a doubt that this is going to end up in most countries eventually so i've got sobering news
[3:40:02.120 --> 3:40:08.760]  for all of you listening today this has broken containment it's out of control in china they're
[3:40:08.760 --> 3:40:14.040]  covering it up by fudging the numbers but as i said in an earlier segment my assessment is this
[3:40:14.040 --> 3:40:19.640]  could currently already have infected a quarter of a million people in china that's a that's a good
[3:40:19.640 --> 3:40:26.840]  estimate a rational estimate based on the information we have as a result containment is likely impossible
[3:40:26.840 --> 3:40:31.320]  and sooner or later this spreads to other countries in asia in self-sustaining outbreaks
[3:40:31.320 --> 3:40:36.600]  seems to be already happening in certain countries perhaps thailand for example early early numbers
[3:40:36.600 --> 3:40:40.680]  there could really explode over the next few weeks we hope they don't but that's the trend
[3:40:40.680 --> 3:40:46.520]  that we're observing eventually this goes everywhere if these experts are correct rebecca
[3:40:46.520 --> 3:40:52.440]  katz a professor and director of the center for global health science and security at georgetown
[3:40:52.440 --> 3:40:57.400]  university says quote this is about mitigation at this point and keeping the global spread
[3:40:57.400 --> 3:41:03.000]  as minimal as possible to hear that she's not saying that this can be contained we can stop it
[3:41:03.000 --> 3:41:07.640]  it's only going to affect china america is going to be fine what these experts are saying now
[3:41:07.640 --> 3:41:13.800]  is that this is about just mitigating the global pandemic because this is going global that's the
[3:41:13.800 --> 3:41:20.440]  news today this is very likely going global there's no way to stop it although it may take many months
[3:41:21.160 --> 3:41:26.280]  to come to the united states in larger numbers this is burning through the human population now
[3:41:26.280 --> 3:41:32.040]  it's going to continue to spread now i want to go to some some additional calls tim in illinois if
[3:41:32.040 --> 3:41:38.760]  you're still with us uh my notes here says you've got experience in the army in the 1970s tim we got
[3:41:38.760 --> 3:41:43.320]  about a minute so give us give us the intro to what you've uh what you've observed what you have to
[3:41:43.320 --> 3:41:52.840]  say here okay i'll go real fast i was uh in the army in uh in the late 70s i was in germany
[3:41:53.480 --> 3:42:00.920]  everybody in our unit got some type of uh lesions on their face uh and they uh told us the the
[3:42:00.920 --> 3:42:07.880]  padre told us that was uh some type of herpes anyway it stayed with me until i got out and then
[3:42:09.000 --> 3:42:15.560]  but i got it in the corner of my uh of my mouth and i wouldn't go away and i kept applying like
[3:42:15.560 --> 3:42:21.480]  alcohol with swabs of it it would just scab over and it would just break out again and then
[3:42:21.480 --> 3:42:28.520]  my mother told me to take that acidophilus and that cleared it up well that's interesting
[3:42:28.520 --> 3:42:35.960]  uh perhaps showing exposure of of military troops to various infectious agents that's of course part
[3:42:35.960 --> 3:42:40.280]  of the history of medical experimentation interesting call we're going to continue to take
[3:42:40.280 --> 3:42:44.840]  your calls here on the alex jones show this is mike adams going to break right now we'll be back
[3:42:44.840 --> 3:42:53.640]  in just a few minutes to continue stay with us info war's life is bringing you a breakthrough
[3:42:53.640 --> 3:42:59.880]  in modern medicine introducing pollen block we have found an extraordinary new natural way to
[3:42:59.880 --> 3:43:05.800]  alleviate seasonal distress symptoms including promoting clear nasal and sinus passageways
[3:43:05.800 --> 3:43:12.920]  eye comfort and respiratory function in the 1960s researchers in france noticed that people who ate
[3:43:12.920 --> 3:43:18.600]  certain quail eggs experienced less seasonal immune and inflammatory responses they began
[3:43:18.600 --> 3:43:23.960]  studying this effect in published trials and decades later we now have the fruit of this research
[3:43:23.960 --> 3:43:30.600]  a fast-acting chewable tablet that helps alleviate seasonal distress symptoms pollen block is natural
[3:43:30.600 --> 3:43:36.280]  and effective it is not an antihistamine in fact current research has found that it actually acts
[3:43:36.280 --> 3:43:41.640]  by blocking the activity of triptase which is an enzyme that amplifies immune and inflammatory
[3:43:41.640 --> 3:43:47.960]  responses in the body go outside and enjoy the air you breathe head to infowarslife.com

[3:45:05.640 --> 3:45:12.120]  here in the u.s. worldwide and president trump's fearlessness when it comes to promoting americana
[3:45:12.120 --> 3:45:18.280]  and basic liberty is amazing as well he's still lacking on the big tech censorship taking action
[3:45:18.280 --> 3:45:22.680]  against that in some other areas but trying to end the wars boosting our economy speaking on
[3:45:22.680 --> 3:45:28.280]  against communist china trump's been doing an amazing job but now more than ever we really
[3:45:28.280 --> 3:45:34.280]  have to realize that we're being targeted because we are effective and the globalist are beginning
[3:45:34.280 --> 3:45:39.720]  to lose their war against humanity in a big way and so we're going to see some major fireworks
[3:45:39.720 --> 3:45:45.560]  out of them but it's critical to not let ourselves get down when we see all the poison they spray

[3:46:24.200 --> 3:46:30.920]  but also re mineralizes the teeth then it has the patented silver salt silver in it to not
[3:46:30.920 --> 3:46:35.160]  have the bacteria that causes ginsivitis this is all proven you can make claims with this
[3:46:35.160 --> 3:46:41.080]  but i have to tell you no one has a toothpaste this good for knocking out the bacteria the viruses
[3:46:41.640 --> 3:46:47.480]  and cleaning the teeth in a healthy way that doesn't strip away the enamel so we're really proud

[3:47:23.240 --> 3:47:26.760]  we're gonna go to john in colorado here in just a second he's apparently got information about
[3:47:27.800 --> 3:47:33.880]  supplies being perhaps wiped out in colorado there so john you're on here live with mike
[3:47:33.880 --> 3:47:43.240]  adams if you're if you're still there go ahead so is yes hi john welcome to show
[3:47:43.240 --> 3:47:51.480]  you all right so i got just some observations i've just noticed because with my work i'm on
[3:47:51.480 --> 3:47:57.480]  home depot on a walmart i'm at the post office all the time and i just noticed the first thing
[3:47:57.480 --> 3:48:05.480]  that i noticed that was weird was there was men in military fatigues hanging out in the aisles
[3:48:05.480 --> 3:48:10.760]  that sell like all the masks and things like that they weren't getting them but they were just kind
[3:48:10.760 --> 3:48:16.600]  of like there at the end caps okay i don't know what you're wondering about something
[3:48:17.800 --> 3:48:20.920]  just kind of like i guess seeing who is buying them or whatnot
[3:48:22.280 --> 3:48:26.680]  the other strange thing is i noticed a lot of people i don't know where they're from
[3:48:27.400 --> 3:48:32.760]  but they're obviously of asian descent and they're buying up all the math
[3:48:32.760 --> 3:48:40.680]  um at walmart home depots um and then also at the post office i noticed a lot of
[3:48:41.640 --> 3:48:46.440]  people with the same descent filling out international customs forms and shipping
[3:48:46.440 --> 3:48:55.240]  big boxes so i can only assume they're shipping them back to china for uh you know the shortage
[3:48:56.040 --> 3:49:00.440]  and then yeah exactly right this is something that we've confirmed uh from our our staff in
[3:49:00.440 --> 3:49:05.400]  taiwan what's happening in taiwan is the taiwan postal service is actually intercepting large
[3:49:05.400 --> 3:49:10.440]  packages where uh people in taiwan are buying or attempting to buy large amounts of masks and
[3:49:10.440 --> 3:49:14.920]  shipping them to china because china has a severe shortage and so the prices on the black market
[3:49:14.920 --> 3:49:19.800]  for those masks are very high in china so the taiwan government is intercepting those packages
[3:49:19.800 --> 3:49:25.400]  and and shipping them back to the taiwan people where they have now daily restrictions you can
[3:49:25.400 --> 3:49:31.480]  only buy three masks per day per person in taiwan so that's interesting what else did you do you
[3:49:31.480 --> 3:49:36.200]  want to add there you were about to say something else um yeah the only other thing that i wanted
[3:49:36.200 --> 3:49:43.160]  to ask you because i know there's a lot of talk about it being a bio weapon from the laboratory
[3:49:43.160 --> 3:49:51.160]  in wuhan is it possible that the chinese government could have been trying to implement
[3:49:51.160 --> 3:49:58.840]  like uh like an experimental vaccine to protect its people against the weapon they're working on
[3:49:58.840 --> 3:50:06.200]  but the vaccine itself may have not protected but actually had like live virus cells in it
[3:50:06.200 --> 3:50:09.960]  and they might have accidentally given it to their people while they were trying to give them an
[3:50:09.960 --> 3:50:14.920]  immunity or something that that's one of the theories that's out there that's certainly a
[3:50:14.920 --> 3:50:20.520]  possibility that that's that's a theory you know the vaccine experiment theory uh my assessment
[3:50:20.520 --> 3:50:24.360]  even though i'm not ruling that out at the moment my assessment is that this was an accidental release
[3:50:24.360 --> 3:50:30.280]  of a biological weapon uh but it's interesting that francis boyle mentioned that he believes
[3:50:30.280 --> 3:50:35.480]  that the globalists around the world have already received the vaccine against this
[3:50:35.480 --> 3:50:41.400]  pandemic strain of corona virus via the pure bright institute so that's an interesting theory
[3:50:41.400 --> 3:50:45.480]  that needs to be looked into but great call thank you for your call i want to take more calls let's
[3:50:45.480 --> 3:50:51.640]  go to tracy in indiana that you've got some information about local activity is that correct
[3:50:51.640 --> 3:50:59.720]  tracy yes hi mike are you there hi i am here yeah welcome to show thank you thank you for
[3:50:59.720 --> 3:51:05.400]  taking my call it's a privilege yes i live in northwest indiana between chicago and gary
[3:51:06.040 --> 3:51:12.600]  and i was out with my kids my eight nine year old on friday running my errand and i saw a lot
[3:51:12.600 --> 3:51:19.000]  of this kind of piggybacks of the last caller a lot of asian descent people i've lived in indiana
[3:51:19.000 --> 3:51:25.960]  all my life never seen swarms of this before um you know i'm in the grocery store there's a very
[3:51:25.960 --> 3:51:32.760]  overly friendly lady uh she says she's been here for a long time very broken english
[3:51:33.320 --> 3:51:39.640]  saying how nice americans are and and stuff like that i'm in the meat section and i noticed also
[3:51:39.640 --> 3:51:46.600]  that our local grocery store had wet wipes there so call me paranoid or whatever i walked away from
[3:51:46.600 --> 3:51:53.240]  her and went got some wet wipes and then the kids and i were making a preparedness run of all things
[3:51:53.240 --> 3:52:01.560]  do you admire down in texas no not that's not something not a retailer here okay it's like
[3:52:01.560 --> 3:52:09.160]  a target walmart type thing so we go over there to make our our preparedness run and once again
[3:52:09.160 --> 3:52:16.280]  the the mire is just swarmed with them and um there was this very weird guy well the weird
[3:52:16.280 --> 3:52:23.960]  situation um we're in the checkout line and this guy in street clothes of asian descent was walking
[3:52:23.960 --> 3:52:30.600]  back and forth looking around on a cell phone and then and that's on the store side of the uh
[3:52:31.160 --> 3:52:36.920]  the uh cash registers and then on the front of the store where the wall is the front wall
[3:52:36.920 --> 3:52:44.200]  all they're all like loitering around these kids and like their early 20s or so on cell phones
[3:52:45.480 --> 3:52:50.840]  now like i said i've lived in in north wicks in the end all my life and i've never seen anything
[3:52:50.840 --> 3:52:56.600]  like this before okay so i mean it's an interesting call i appreciate your information your call and
[3:52:56.600 --> 3:53:00.040]  a previous call basically what you're both telling me is that asian people are buying
[3:53:00.040 --> 3:53:07.000]  you know preparedness gear which everybody should be doing that so you know i i'm not surprised to
[3:53:07.000 --> 3:53:12.680]  see people of of asian descent out there buying masks and and and hand sanitizers and things
[3:53:12.680 --> 3:53:16.840]  like that it actually tells me they're ahead of the curve on this it actually it makes me wonder
[3:53:16.840 --> 3:53:21.000]  why aren't average americans out there buying this gear because this thing's going global
[3:53:21.000 --> 3:53:26.040]  according to experts that i quoted in the previous segment and i would not be surprised that
[3:53:26.040 --> 3:53:33.560]  that you know asian people and remember my wife is asian i'm i lived in in asia that that asian
[3:53:33.560 --> 3:53:39.080]  people are ahead of the curve on this they're getting texts you know from maybe their relatives
[3:53:39.080 --> 3:53:45.080]  or friends in taiwan or in hong kong or in china and they're they're actually seeing the news
[3:53:45.080 --> 3:53:49.160]  that is being denied to the average american by the mainstream media here in america so
[3:53:49.720 --> 3:53:55.240]  so what you're saying i absolutely believe it is very accurate but let's remember everybody
[3:53:55.240 --> 3:53:59.240]  should be out there doing that and and you know your call is great by the way thank you for your
[3:53:59.240 --> 3:54:05.720]  call i also just want to mention as a as a you know a racial profiling type of thing i'm a little
[3:54:05.720 --> 3:54:10.760]  bit concerned that as this pandemic gets a lot worse we've already started to see i think in
[3:54:10.760 --> 3:54:19.560]  new york one person beat up an asian woman because she was wearing a mask and in asia when you wear
[3:54:19.560 --> 3:54:24.760]  a mask you do so because you don't want to be infected it's normal to see people wearing masks
[3:54:24.760 --> 3:54:29.160]  every day on the street even without a pandemic people riding their motor scooters down the streets
[3:54:29.160 --> 3:54:35.960]  of taipei they've got masks on it's totally normal in america the american view of this is that asians
[3:54:35.960 --> 3:54:42.760]  who are wearing masks must be infected and so what's happening is asian people taiwan people
[3:54:42.760 --> 3:54:48.280]  hong kong people china people are coming to america and they're wearing masks as a measure of
[3:54:48.280 --> 3:54:55.080]  protection to try to prevent getting infected and then some americans who are not familiar
[3:54:55.080 --> 3:54:59.480]  with asian culture are looking at them and saying oh my god that person must be infected i have to
[3:54:59.480 --> 3:55:04.680]  get away so i i want to try to educate people because i've lived in both worlds you know i speak
[3:55:04.680 --> 3:55:12.920]  chinese um i want to tell people that asian people are smart to be getting prepared and american people
[3:55:12.920 --> 3:55:18.680]  are way behind right now and there's going to be a day where the american people wake up and say
[3:55:18.680 --> 3:55:24.200]  hey why didn't we go buy masks why didn't we buy latex gloves why didn't we get colloidal silver or
[3:55:24.200 --> 3:55:29.960]  a backup food supply you know well the media was lying to you and the tech giants were censoring
[3:55:29.960 --> 3:55:35.000]  the truth right and the government was lying to you as well and the government people are lying
[3:55:35.000 --> 3:55:39.080]  to the president president trump is not a virologist he doesn't know all this stuff he's
[3:55:39.080 --> 3:55:43.560]  relying on people who are lying to him so i don't blame trump for this by the way but the people
[3:55:43.560 --> 3:55:51.240]  who are lying to him but i just i just want to mention everybody all human beings on planet earth
[3:55:51.240 --> 3:55:57.880]  should be preparing doesn't matter if you're asian you know if you're latino if you're black or white
[3:55:57.880 --> 3:56:02.200]  or european or russian or whatever everybody should be getting prepared right now and the
[3:56:02.200 --> 3:56:06.760]  fact that most people are not getting prepared is probably going to make this worse and it's the
[3:56:06.760 --> 3:56:12.840]  complicity of the media lying to the people right now covering this up and even attacking those of
[3:56:12.840 --> 3:56:17.560]  us who are telling the truth about all this the media is going to make this much worse the media
[3:56:18.120 --> 3:56:25.800]  i'm convinced the left-wing media and the who and the tech giants they want more people to die
[3:56:25.800 --> 3:56:32.280]  they want this thing to spread why would the who say stop blocking infected chinese people from
[3:56:32.280 --> 3:56:36.520]  entering your country why would they say that if they didn't want it to spread so you know we've
[3:56:36.520 --> 3:56:41.960]  had great callers today a lot of good information a lot of analysis people doing the research out

[3:56:50.600 --> 3:56:56.760]  you are living in a nation of people who are oblivious to the reality of what is happening
[3:56:56.760 --> 3:57:03.000]  right now and most people will remain oblivious until the day they panic because they did nothing
[3:57:03.000 --> 3:57:07.880]  to prepare because they were completely isolated from knowledge because of the censorship in the
[3:57:07.880 --> 3:57:13.080]  fake media and that's why it's crucial to spread the word about info wars get more people to watch
