[00:00:18.559 --> 00:00:21.883]  Trump will never be president!
[00:00:21.883 --> 00:00:25.107]  So said the fake news.
[00:00:25.107 --> 00:00:31.596]  From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[00:00:31.596 --> 00:00:35.881]  What we are looking at is good and evil, right and wrong.
[00:00:41.391 --> 00:00:44.312]  Ladies and gentlemen, I'm your host Alex Jones.
[00:00:44.312 --> 00:00:49.833]  We're in the middle of a 34-hour broadcast that just started three hours ago with David Knight and The Real News.
[00:00:49.833 --> 00:00:51.874]  It's every weekday morning, 8 a.m.
[00:00:51.874 --> 00:00:52.834]  I'm Alex Jones.
[00:00:52.834 --> 00:00:55.075]  This is the InfoWarb.
[00:00:55.075 --> 00:00:58.116]  I'm gonna be here for the next four hours and then I'm coming back tonight.
[00:00:59.096 --> 00:01:07.299]  Eight o'clock, but in between then we've got Leanne McAdoo and Paul Joseph Watson and Owen Schroyer and a bunch of other guests and your phone calls.
[00:01:07.299 --> 00:01:10.781]  Something I'm thinking about doing is starting to have Skype calls.
[00:01:10.781 --> 00:01:16.903]  Segments every day where people can call in on their Skype and be on air with us live that way.
[00:01:16.903 --> 00:01:21.665]  Yes, quite a few interesting things we've got in the works here, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:01:23.032 --> 00:01:25.133]  There's a lot of positive things happening, obviously.
[00:01:25.133 --> 00:01:36.140]  We're going to have some cringeworthy compilations of the left saying Trump would never be president, Madame Hillary, then their meltdown that night, lots of screaming at the sky.
[00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:37.341]  No!
[00:01:37.341 --> 00:01:39.382]  That's not true!
[00:01:39.382 --> 00:01:41.883]  That's impossible!
[00:01:41.883 --> 00:01:43.624]  Search your feelings.
[00:01:43.624 --> 00:01:48.087]  You know it to be true.
[00:01:48.087 --> 00:01:52.290]  In fact, that's all coming up.
[00:01:53.134 --> 00:01:58.856]  But that said, I've got really serious news here.
[00:01:58.856 --> 00:02:03.157]  Quite a bit of it, quite frankly.
[00:02:03.157 --> 00:02:07.999]  We have a source who got picked up by the FBI last night.
[00:02:07.999 --> 00:02:11.740]  I know who the source is.
[00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:19.123]  And he's actually been in the news before and has been a prominent member of the military and the intelligence community.
[00:02:19.123 --> 00:02:22.584]  And he is a private contractor now with another group.
[00:02:24.668 --> 00:02:31.772]  And I could tell he was real calling in the last year or so because of how accurate his information was from my own sources.
[00:02:31.772 --> 00:02:35.954]  But then the last few weeks I learned who he was specifically.
[00:02:35.954 --> 00:02:44.999]  And the FBI came, picked him up two hours after he was on as a caller, took him in to a military facility, and he's there.
[00:02:46.906 --> 00:02:48.186]  He's even still got his phone.
[00:02:48.186 --> 00:02:52.308]  They took it away and downloaded it and took his laptop and home computer.
[00:02:52.308 --> 00:02:59.250]  And he's got a lawyer now over the information he said on air.
[00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:15.995]  Now, obviously, folks, I don't violate national security laws, but as a journalist, you've got some special protections and basically are if it's in the interest of the country and if it doesn't endanger critical infrastructure and all this other verbiage.
[00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:19.021]  I think?
[00:03:37.557 --> 00:03:42.579]  How Yemeni terrorists have been decapitated with what the Saudi King and the U.S.
[00:03:42.579 --> 00:03:44.000]  have done last week.
[00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:49.142]  There's a civil war ongoing and about to be a hot war between Iran and Saudi Arabia.
[00:03:49.142 --> 00:03:50.023]  Well, that's in the news.
[00:03:51.220 --> 00:03:59.342]  But just that the word is Yemeni terrorists are getting ready to strike in Europe and the United States as part of this civil war.
[00:03:59.342 --> 00:04:11.366]  Within two hours of him saying that, the FBI was at his house, had transcription recordings of his last seven or eight phone calls in the last few months here.
[00:04:11.366 --> 00:04:18.108]  He'd already been called in a few weeks ago to the military base to be questioned, but he was basically forcibly taken in.
[00:04:18.108 --> 00:04:18.928]  He didn't resist it.
[00:04:20.225 --> 00:04:27.012]  And I love how I see some commenters on Infowars or commenters over at Media Matters going, Jones claims he has this source.
[00:04:27.012 --> 00:04:28.053]  Yeah, right.
[00:04:28.053 --> 00:04:34.580]  Just like we claimed the president told us that he was going to release the JFK files and the next day announced he was.
[00:04:34.580 --> 00:04:36.682]  Our sources are real and the media hates it.
[00:04:36.682 --> 00:04:39.105]  Because we're real media and they're fake media.
[00:04:39.105 --> 00:04:42.789]  And this is a big deal because the fact that they snatched him up so quick
[00:04:44.039 --> 00:04:52.325]  Trying to claim that he may have violated his national security clearance shows you they do not want him talking and letting you know what's going on.
[00:04:52.325 --> 00:04:55.288]  This is all really, really serious information.
[00:04:55.288 --> 00:04:55.728]  Stay with us.
[00:05:14.262 --> 00:05:20.448]  The truck got in this morning and it's back but it is a limited run because of all the testing and all the rest of it.
[00:05:20.448 --> 00:05:21.630]  It's the highest quality.
[00:05:21.630 --> 00:05:23.612]  Read about what it'll do for you and your family.
[00:05:23.612 --> 00:05:24.493]  It is amazing.
[00:05:24.493 --> 00:05:29.257]  We also have been sold out for three months on biome defense super high quality probiotic.
[00:05:29.257 --> 00:05:29.458]  It's 25% off.
[00:05:31.099 --> 00:05:35.261]  Out of the gates, back in stock, but for a very limited time.
[00:05:35.261 --> 00:05:37.801]  So you get the highest quality, the very cleanest stuff out there.
[00:05:37.801 --> 00:05:39.202]  We're really, really proud of it.
[00:05:39.202 --> 00:05:41.083]  DNA Force and Bomb Defense.
[00:05:41.083 --> 00:05:41.623]  Probiotic.
[00:05:41.623 --> 00:05:42.503]  Now back in stock.
[00:05:42.503 --> 00:05:43.644]  Infowarslife.com.
[00:05:43.644 --> 00:05:47.485]  And when you buy products from Globalist, it's an act of trading with the enemy.
[00:05:47.485 --> 00:05:48.585]  It is an act of war.
[00:05:48.585 --> 00:05:50.646]  It is an act of standing up.
[00:05:50.646 --> 00:05:56.228]  When you spread the links, the articles, and buy products from us, and then we commit to rampage against the enemy totally.
[00:06:00.097 --> 00:06:06.560]  This program contains language and sequences some viewers may find disturbing.
[00:06:06.560 --> 00:06:09.882]  The nation and all of our freedoms hang by a thread!
[00:06:09.882 --> 00:06:13.803]  And the military apparatus of this country is about to be handed over to scum!
[00:06:13.803 --> 00:06:15.864]  Lord behold it to scum!
[00:06:15.864 --> 00:06:17.505]  Russian scum!
[00:06:17.505 --> 00:06:18.646]  Listen.
[00:06:18.646 --> 00:06:26.229]  Please listen.
[00:06:26.229 --> 00:06:27.810]  If you don't, if you won't,
[00:06:28.863 --> 00:06:34.526]  If you fail to understand, then the same incredible terror that's menacing me will strike at you!
[00:06:34.526 --> 00:06:38.668]  The function of all life is survival.
[00:06:38.668 --> 00:06:40.649]  Sleep.
[00:06:40.649 --> 00:06:42.610]  Sleep.
[00:06:42.610 --> 00:06:44.090]  Sleep.
[00:06:44.090 --> 00:06:44.611]  Oh my God!
[00:06:44.611 --> 00:06:45.171]  Oh my God!
[00:06:45.171 --> 00:06:45.511]  Oh my God!
[00:06:45.511 --> 00:06:46.311]  Lock the door!
[00:06:46.311 --> 00:06:46.752]  Lock the door!
[00:06:46.752 --> 00:06:47.672]  They're coming!
[00:06:47.672 --> 00:06:48.813]  They're coming!
[00:06:48.813 --> 00:06:49.533]  Help!
[00:06:49.533 --> 00:06:50.253]  Help!
[00:06:50.253 --> 00:06:51.194]  They're coming!
[00:06:51.194 --> 00:06:51.934]  They're coming!
[00:06:51.934 --> 00:06:52.875]  Listen to me!
[00:06:52.875 --> 00:06:53.175]  Listen!
[00:06:55.931 --> 00:06:57.032]  Please, you're next!
[00:06:57.032 --> 00:06:58.092]  We're in danger!
[00:06:58.092 --> 00:06:59.153]  Please, listen to me!
[00:06:59.153 --> 00:07:00.273]  Something terrible!
[00:07:00.273 --> 00:07:00.533]  Please!
[00:07:00.533 --> 00:07:01.274]  You're next!
[00:07:01.274 --> 00:07:01.614]  Here they are!
[00:07:01.614 --> 00:07:02.434]  They're already here!
[00:07:02.434 --> 00:07:02.994]  Come!
[00:07:02.994 --> 00:07:05.275]  You're next!
[00:07:05.275 --> 00:07:06.156]  They're coming!
[00:07:06.156 --> 00:07:07.096]  They're coming!
[00:07:07.096 --> 00:07:07.837]  Mr. Dunston.
[00:07:07.837 --> 00:07:08.657]  Sleep.
[00:07:08.657 --> 00:07:09.797]  The seed is planted.
[00:07:09.797 --> 00:07:11.758]  Sleep.
[00:07:11.758 --> 00:07:12.699]  Sleep.
[00:07:12.699 --> 00:07:14.079]  Terror grows.
[00:07:14.079 --> 00:07:14.340]  Sleep.
[00:07:14.340 --> 00:07:16.140]  Elizabeth, wake up!
[00:07:16.140 --> 00:07:17.721]  He'll get you when you sleep!
[00:07:17.721 --> 00:07:19.282]  Sit up!
[00:07:19.282 --> 00:07:21.463]  Invasion of the Body Snatchers.
[00:07:22.908 --> 00:07:25.131]  All of a sudden they're growing like parasites.
[00:07:25.131 --> 00:07:26.432]  Is it contagious?
[00:07:26.432 --> 00:07:28.455]  It looked right at me.
[00:07:28.455 --> 00:07:31.899]  You're looking at us as if it was human.
[00:07:31.899 --> 00:07:34.882]  We're not human.
[00:07:34.882 --> 00:07:38.066]  Now, the classic fear begins to grow.
[00:07:38.066 --> 00:07:39.848]  We're being cornered!
[00:07:39.848 --> 00:07:43.312]  In a modern masterpiece of science fiction.
[00:08:16.291 --> 00:08:16.971]  Here we are.
[00:08:16.971 --> 00:08:42.508]  It is the one-year anniversary, ladies and gentlemen, of the massive defeat of the globalists and their propaganda armies and the $3 billion they spent, the $400 million that Trump spent, the American economy turned around, our sovereignty turned around, the VA getting fixed, 70% reduction in illegals coming across the border, and you know how real Trump is by his enemies, the total panicking, the total freaking out, the total insanity.
[00:08:42.508 --> 00:08:44.830]  Eight special elections that were highly contested
[00:08:46.363 --> 00:08:51.227]  Have gone for Tea Party, Patriot, Libertarian Republicans.
[00:08:51.227 --> 00:08:59.593]  In New Jersey and Virginia, both states that Trump lost a year ago today, it went to the Democrats.
[00:08:59.593 --> 00:09:06.478]  The media's spinning that, that, oh my gosh, it's over for Trump, it's over for the House, it's over for the Senate, it's all being reversed.
[00:09:06.478 --> 00:09:09.640]  No.
[00:09:09.640 --> 00:09:11.702]  The Democrats have lost
[00:09:12.907 --> 00:09:17.528]  In many areas that they actually won during the last election.
[00:09:17.528 --> 00:09:29.470]  And the fact that they put all their money, 3 to 1, 4 to 1, against these Republican candidates and then won, is a testament to the fact that Trump didn't endorse them and they were neocons.
[00:09:29.470 --> 00:09:40.292]  And just like we saw in Alabama, the libertarian, conservative, patriot, make America great again movement is not going to vote for Republican in name only people.
[00:09:41.206 --> 00:09:43.748]  We're punishing that political party.
[00:09:43.748 --> 00:09:46.109]  We are taking it over.
[00:09:46.109 --> 00:09:55.136]  There's new polls out showing the Democratic Party is the most unpopular in its history and is the most unpopular institution in America.
[00:09:55.136 --> 00:09:59.319]  The Democrats are even more unpopular than the mainstream media.
[00:09:59.319 --> 00:10:01.480]  Huge.
[00:10:01.480 --> 00:10:04.662]  So this is all coming up today.
[00:10:04.662 --> 00:10:09.646]  Now, we have a source who was formerly in the Army and in special operations in Florida.
[00:10:10.691 --> 00:10:22.193]  And he never gave us any secret info, but I knew he was accurate, because I have sources in that same group, and sources all the way up to the President, as you know, and to many of his advisors.
[00:10:22.193 --> 00:10:26.314]  So I knew what this caller, Zach, had been saying was dead on.
[00:10:26.314 --> 00:10:27.515]  Dead on.
[00:10:27.515 --> 00:10:31.015]  Well, I learned a few weeks ago his identity, looked him up in the news.
[00:10:31.015 --> 00:10:36.336]  He's a decorated, well-known individual in intelligence.
[00:10:36.336 --> 00:10:38.117]  Going back over a decade,
[00:10:39.195 --> 00:10:41.397]  He's now out of the military.
[00:10:41.397 --> 00:10:47.523]  He didn't give us anything secret, but he talked about what was public information that pointed out how to connect the dots.
[00:10:47.523 --> 00:10:50.826]  The FBI came and basically arrested him last night.
[00:10:50.826 --> 00:10:51.687]  They took him by force.
[00:10:51.687 --> 00:10:53.409]  He didn't resist.
[00:10:53.409 --> 00:10:54.370]  They said you have no choice.
[00:10:54.370 --> 00:10:58.974]  They took his computers, laptop, and took him to a military base.
[00:10:58.974 --> 00:11:02.077]  He was given his phone back, able to call us and call his lawyer.
[00:11:02.077 --> 00:11:03.399]  He's asked we not give out his identity.
[00:11:04.318 --> 00:11:05.938]  There's not going to be a President Donald Trump.
[00:11:05.938 --> 00:11:07.519]  That's not going to happen.
[00:11:07.519 --> 00:11:08.639]  Donald Trump will not become President!
[00:11:28.772 --> 00:11:30.212]  He's not going to be president.
[00:11:30.212 --> 00:11:31.413]  He is not.
[00:11:31.413 --> 00:11:34.433]  Donald Trump is not going to be president of the United States.
[00:11:34.433 --> 00:11:35.353]  Take it to the bank.
[00:11:35.353 --> 00:11:36.273]  I guarantee it.
[00:11:36.273 --> 00:11:37.034]  Alright, alright.
[00:11:37.034 --> 00:11:40.914]  I think if he becomes the president, it'll make it great because the states is already great.
[00:11:40.914 --> 00:11:49.016]  I think that man will be president of the United States right about the time that spaceships come down filled with dinosaurs and red capes.
[00:11:49.016 --> 00:11:49.916]  On that note, Tom.
[00:11:49.916 --> 00:11:51.516]  Take it from me.
[00:11:51.516 --> 00:11:53.117]  How about that?
[00:11:53.117 --> 00:11:54.397]  And then of course there's Donald Trump.
[00:11:55.438 --> 00:12:01.397]  Donald Trump has been saying that he will run for president as a Republican, which is surprising since I just assumed he was running as a joke.
[00:12:09.315 --> 00:12:14.076]  Donald Trump, just last week he confirmed to the National Review that he is again considering a run in 2016.
[00:12:14.076 --> 00:12:14.977]  Do it.
[00:12:14.977 --> 00:12:17.417]  Do it.
[00:12:17.417 --> 00:12:19.818]  Look at me.
[00:12:19.818 --> 00:12:20.878]  Do it.
[00:12:20.878 --> 00:12:30.621]  I will personally write you a campaign check now on behalf of this country, which does not want you to be president, but which badly wants you to run.
[00:12:31.375 --> 00:12:42.325]  So when you stand and deliver that State of the Union address, in no part of your mind or brain can you imagine Donald Trump standing up one day and delivering a State of the Union address?
[00:12:42.325 --> 00:12:47.009]  Well, I can imagine it in a Saturday night skit.
[00:12:47.689 --> 00:12:50.130]  I continue to believe Mr. Trump will not be president.
[00:12:50.130 --> 00:12:53.372]  He will never be president of the United States.
[00:12:53.372 --> 00:12:57.994]  And we better be ready for the fact that he might be leaving the Republican ticket next year.
[00:12:57.994 --> 00:13:01.355]  I know you don't believe that, but I want to go on.
[00:13:01.355 --> 00:13:02.216]  Sorry to laugh.
[00:13:02.216 --> 00:13:04.076]  Okay, here we are.
[00:13:04.076 --> 00:13:09.019]  And which Republican candidate has the best chance of winning the general election?
[00:13:09.019 --> 00:13:11.580]  Of the declared ones right now, Donald Trump.
[00:13:19.708 --> 00:13:27.514]  And so, right now, Mr. Trump, to answer your call for political honesty, I just want to say, you're not going to be president, alright?
[00:13:27.514 --> 00:13:28.794]  It's been fun.
[00:13:28.794 --> 00:13:32.557]  It's been great.
[00:13:32.557 --> 00:13:35.759]  I love you.
[00:13:35.759 --> 00:13:38.781]  But, but, come on, come on, buddy.
[00:13:38.781 --> 00:13:47.628]  All, let's say, cow poo poo aside, there is zero chance we'll be seeing you being sworn in on the Capitol steps with your hand on a giant golden Bible.
[00:13:48.976 --> 00:13:50.997]  I'll make a prediction, though, for you.
[00:13:50.997 --> 00:13:55.119]  I don't really get into predictions much, but this one I'll go way out on a limb.
[00:13:55.119 --> 00:14:01.163]  Donald Trump will never, ever be President of the United States.
[00:14:01.163 --> 00:14:03.544]  Trump should not be in this race.
[00:14:03.544 --> 00:14:04.845]  He's an absurdity.
[00:14:04.845 --> 00:14:07.066]  He is a travesty.
[00:14:07.066 --> 00:14:10.868]  Donald Trump will never be elected President of the United States.
[00:14:10.868 --> 00:14:15.811]  Donald Trump is a here-today-gone-tomorrow candidate for President of the United States.
[00:14:17.165 --> 00:14:20.887]  Donald Trump is not going to be president of the United States.
[00:14:20.887 --> 00:14:28.690]  Uh, ever respectful of the fact that the people have not voted, he's not going to be president of the United States.
[00:14:28.690 --> 00:14:29.731]  Let's be clear.
[00:14:29.731 --> 00:14:32.692]  Donald Trump will lose the election.
[00:14:32.692 --> 00:14:38.134]  I mean, he had a really good chance to be different and really have a chance to change things, but he doesn't do the work.
[00:14:38.134 --> 00:14:39.415]  He's lazy.
[00:14:39.415 --> 00:14:41.956]  We talk about him every day and we continuously bash him.
[00:14:41.956 --> 00:14:42.816]  He's not going to be the president.
[00:14:42.816 --> 00:14:43.697]  Don't worry about it.
[00:14:45.402 --> 00:14:48.205]  It's a wake-up call to the Republican Party.
[00:14:48.205 --> 00:14:53.952]  Despite Boris thinking that Donald Trump could win New York, the presidential race is over.
[00:14:53.952 --> 00:14:54.792]  Could I just cut through?
[00:14:54.792 --> 00:14:57.275]  I have one thing to say, one thing only.
[00:14:57.275 --> 00:14:59.998]  And that is that this race is over.
[00:15:00.879 --> 00:15:03.682]  Tomorrow morning, the money will dry up.
[00:15:03.682 --> 00:15:05.824]  The Republicans will start to hide.
[00:15:05.824 --> 00:15:07.185]  Trump has no place to go.
[00:15:07.185 --> 00:15:12.750]  This race, effectively, as of tonight, is no longer a presidential race.
[00:15:12.750 --> 00:15:19.296]  I mean, everything I know about presidential politics, and I've been through five of them, I've never seen one like this.
[00:15:19.296 --> 00:15:20.397]  This race is over.
[00:15:20.397 --> 00:15:21.358]  You might as well accept it.
[00:15:21.658 --> 00:15:24.580]  And the question now is, how do you minimize damage?
[00:15:24.580 --> 00:15:34.867]  And the only way you can do that, it seems to me, is to try to grab hold of some old conservative value things, and do what Mondale did in 84, which is try to save a few people down ballot.
[00:15:34.867 --> 00:15:40.491]  But as far as Donald Trump's concerned, it will never, ever, ever happen.
[00:15:40.491 --> 00:15:45.775]  President Obama will go down as perhaps the worst president in the history of the United States!
[00:15:45.775 --> 00:15:49.077]  Exclamation point, at real Donald Trump.
[00:15:51.141 --> 00:15:53.666]  That's real Donald Trump.
[00:15:53.666 --> 00:15:56.191]  At least I will go down as a president.
[00:15:58.095 --> 00:15:59.956]  Fully cooked, ready-to-eat bacon.
[00:15:59.956 --> 00:16:03.199]  I'm talking thick, meaty, center-cut, presidential bacon.
[00:16:03.199 --> 00:16:04.800]  Savory and delicious.
[00:16:04.800 --> 00:16:07.622]  I buy some, I use some, I store some.
[00:16:07.622 --> 00:16:08.302]  Awesome.
[00:16:08.302 --> 00:16:11.384]  No refrigeration needed with a 10-year shelf life.
[00:16:11.384 --> 00:16:12.946]  NASA PAC Technology.

[00:16:17.729 --> 00:16:19.170]  Or warm and served.
[00:16:19.170 --> 00:16:21.211]  Life-saving, ready-to-eat bacon.
[00:16:21.211 --> 00:16:23.133]  10-year shelf life bacon.

[00:16:27.898 --> 00:16:33.020]  The answer to being in control of your own health care is freedom from insurance.
[00:16:33.020 --> 00:16:38.722]  Become part of a group of self-pay patients that come together to share in each other's medical expenses.
[00:16:38.722 --> 00:16:43.925]  Individual share amounts begin at $107 a month and $347 for families.

[00:16:45.865 --> 00:16:48.246]  Holistic treatment may be eligible for sharing.
[00:16:48.246 --> 00:16:49.207]  See guidelines.

[00:20:01.638 --> 00:20:04.300]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:20:13.864 --> 00:20:15.507]  We've seen the end of the Clintons.
[00:20:15.507 --> 00:20:18.050]  We'll soon see the end of the globalists.
[00:20:18.050 --> 00:20:20.834]  Donald J. Trump is now President of the United States.
[00:20:20.834 --> 00:20:22.096]  It's not true!
[00:20:22.096 --> 00:20:24.539]  That's impossible!
[00:20:24.539 --> 00:20:26.101]  Search your feelings.
[00:20:26.101 --> 00:20:28.545]  You know it to be true.
[00:20:51.397 --> 00:20:58.766]  It's also what happens when you listen to the radio host Alex Jones.
[00:20:58.766 --> 00:20:59.988]  Move, bitch!
[00:20:59.988 --> 00:21:00.789]  Get out the way!
[00:21:07.892 --> 00:21:09.013]  The American flag!
[00:21:09.013 --> 00:21:13.557]  Infowars helped fuel the rumor that President Obama is an ISIS supporter.
[00:21:13.557 --> 00:21:16.800]  It's been a cozy relationship from the beginning.
[00:21:16.800 --> 00:21:18.501]  I will not let you down.
[00:21:18.501 --> 00:21:20.703]  You'll be very, very impressed, I hope.
[00:21:20.703 --> 00:21:23.045]  And I think we'll be speaking a lot.
[00:21:23.045 --> 00:21:25.207]  Donald Trump and Alex Jones.
[00:21:25.207 --> 00:21:30.932]  This means that Donald Trump will be the 45th President of the United States.
[00:21:30.932 --> 00:21:33.514]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:21:33.514 --> 00:21:34.715]  It's Alex Jones!
[00:21:36.400 --> 00:21:38.582]  Well, he's not let us down so far.
[00:21:38.582 --> 00:21:43.505]  Not on the Second Amendment, not on borders, not on sovereignty, not on taxes, not on regulations.
[00:21:43.505 --> 00:21:50.750]  He's just done everything he said he'd done, or been like a bull in a china shop trying to get it done.
[00:21:50.750 --> 00:21:52.492]  He's over-performed.
[00:21:52.492 --> 00:21:55.934]  And he said, I will not let you down.
[00:21:55.934 --> 00:21:58.516]  And I think we'll be speaking a lot.
[00:21:58.516 --> 00:21:59.637]  And he's done everything he said he'd do.
[00:22:01.542 --> 00:22:03.162]  One year anniversary.
[00:22:03.162 --> 00:22:05.803]  By the way, if you just joined us, this is not satire.
[00:22:05.803 --> 00:22:11.885]  This is a story on Infowars.com from Paul Joseph Watson.
[00:22:11.885 --> 00:22:17.746]  They were going to have a Scream at the Sky Fest November 4th, but they canceled that.
[00:22:17.746 --> 00:22:23.187]  They did have their demonstrations and their attacks on police and things, but it kind of fizzled out.
[00:22:23.187 --> 00:22:25.228]  Then the media came out and said, Jones made it up.
[00:22:25.228 --> 00:22:26.608]  Nothing happened November 4th.
[00:22:26.608 --> 00:22:30.309]  See, if their revolution fails, oh, they recycle it and say we made it up.
[00:22:31.852 --> 00:22:35.555]  They never failed, they just said they never even took the field.
[00:22:35.555 --> 00:22:39.039]  But today, I guess we're going to get some new viral videos out of this.
[00:22:39.039 --> 00:22:43.123]  Nationwide anti-Trump temper tantrum takes place today.
[00:22:43.123 --> 00:22:47.207]  They changed the date to the one year anniversary last week.
[00:22:47.207 --> 00:22:49.510]  Liberals will scream helplessly at the sky.
[00:22:49.510 --> 00:22:51.632]  That's the name of the event.
[00:22:51.632 --> 00:22:54.555]  Scream helplessly at the sky.
[00:22:56.004 --> 00:23:05.369]  It's like the universities hand out Play-Doh and construction paper and Etch-A-Sketches if you get triggered by a pocket constitution or by a Halloween costume.
[00:23:05.369 --> 00:23:16.755]  The universities nationwide and in Europe, you go into a toddler room with low desks, like when you were three years old, and you play with Play-Doh and Crayolas.
[00:23:16.755 --> 00:23:20.757]  By the way, I'm not joking.
[00:23:20.757 --> 00:23:21.738]  I'm not joking.
[00:23:21.738 --> 00:23:22.158]  Here's a clip.
[00:23:23.365 --> 00:23:37.198]  Anti-Trump social justice warriors are planning events across America on the anniversary of the election, during which they will scream helplessly at the sky.
[00:23:37.198 --> 00:23:40.361]  And you thought we'd seen the last of the autistic screeching.
[00:23:40.361 --> 00:23:42.663]  Now we get to enjoy it all over again.
[00:23:45.609 --> 00:23:49.955]  The biggest event will be in Boston, where thousands of people have indicated they'll be attending.
[00:23:49.955 --> 00:23:53.860]  Similar events will take place in Austin, Philadelphia, New York, and Chicago.
[00:23:53.860 --> 00:23:59.107]  Come join us as we scream helplessly into the sky using words, moans, yells of choice to lament this show that is American politics!
[00:23:59.107 --> 00:24:03.612]  They're even telling people who can't attend to just scream in their own backyards!
[00:24:05.089 --> 00:24:07.490]  But the attendees themselves are excited.
[00:24:07.490 --> 00:24:09.830]  I intend to scream, begging for help at the sky!
[00:24:09.830 --> 00:24:10.090]  Huh?
[00:24:10.090 --> 00:24:10.731]  This is awesome!
[00:24:10.731 --> 00:24:12.691]  I'll be screaming helplessly at the sky in California!
[00:24:12.691 --> 00:24:14.732]  Hard to believe this nightmare has lasted this long!
[00:24:14.732 --> 00:24:16.672]  We could have a yelling parade from the park to the capital!
[00:24:16.672 --> 00:24:18.373]  This needs to be global, please!
[00:24:18.373 --> 00:24:19.973]  What's the hashtag so we can get this trending?
[00:24:19.973 --> 00:24:22.234]  This is the greatest Facebook event I've ever seen!
[00:24:22.234 --> 00:24:32.477]  And to illustrate how sensitive these snowflakes are, one of them got triggered by the fact that the organizers chose to illustrate the Facebook event page with a picture of white men.
[00:24:32.477 --> 00:24:33.757]  Why is the cover picture seemingly about
[00:24:33.917 --> 00:24:34.277]  Who cares?
[00:24:34.277 --> 00:24:38.960]  They even identified with the screaming woman who became a living meme after the inauguration.
[00:24:48.130 --> 00:24:51.232]  She-Ra was totally feeling that like every day.
[00:24:51.232 --> 00:25:06.801]  So we're nearly a year after the election and still, still, all the left has in terms of a counter-argument is to call everyone Nazis and engage in public temper tantrums where they yell into empty space like deranged mental asylum escapees.
[00:25:06.801 --> 00:25:09.162]  I literally am gonna die, I need an ambulance, I can't believe it!
[00:25:20.718 --> 00:25:23.341]  Good luck attracting voters with that platform!
[00:25:23.341 --> 00:25:25.083]  And no, this is not fake.
[00:25:25.083 --> 00:25:34.132]  Although people have started creating fake identical events to troll them, the organizers of the original event in Boston are both anti-Trump activists.
[00:25:34.132 --> 00:25:35.694]  This is actually happening.
[00:25:35.694 --> 00:25:40.739]  People all over the country are arranging their own autistic, screeching, hissy fits.
[00:25:40.959 --> 00:25:46.663]  And please, don't tell them how stupid this is gonna look, because I can't wait to use the footage.
[00:25:46.663 --> 00:25:50.186]  It could literally be the best video I ever make.
[00:25:50.186 --> 00:26:03.936]  Also, it's gonna look pretty damn good in those Trump 2020 campaign ads too, so... Don't let them know how ridiculous they are until it's over.
[00:26:03.936 --> 00:26:05.978]  By the way, this is not a joke.
[00:26:09.019 --> 00:26:26.871]  There are 4,000 people on a event page in Austin, we'll put on screen for TV viewers, that are interested in this, and generally there's a ratio of about 10% show up, so that's hundreds and hundreds of people that are going to show up, scream, help us hit the sky on the anniversary of the election.
[00:26:26.871 --> 00:26:32.375]  And that's 651 say they're going, see my ratio was about right, 4.1 interested.
[00:26:37.333 --> 00:26:41.454]  I mean, they've been trained to be helpless mental patients by the social engineers.
[00:26:41.454 --> 00:26:44.594]  They go get three, four worthless degrees to sabotage them.
[00:26:44.594 --> 00:26:56.516]  The university engages in psych warfare to create jellyfish that are into being victims, but don't know who they were victimized by, and then march out against the living.
[00:26:56.516 --> 00:27:01.937]  Now, when we come back, I've been covered in this for 20 plus years.
[00:27:01.937 --> 00:27:04.658]  This didn't just start, but they're coming out with it now.
[00:27:05.720 --> 00:27:07.101]  The Sun is reporting on it.
[00:27:07.101 --> 00:27:08.782]  It's top-linked on Drudge.
[00:27:08.782 --> 00:27:12.765]  Scientists are implanting tiny human brains into rats.
[00:27:12.765 --> 00:27:15.007]  Now we know how the Democrats are going to get their voters back.
[00:27:15.007 --> 00:27:16.408]  They're going to create them.
[00:27:16.408 --> 00:27:20.171]  Also, EPA approves bacteria infected insects to kill mosquitoes.
[00:27:20.171 --> 00:27:20.991]  Can anybody say...
[00:27:21.980 --> 00:27:23.081]  The Andromeda Strain?
[00:27:23.081 --> 00:27:25.763]  We're making new alien lifeforms here on Earth.
[00:27:25.763 --> 00:27:27.404]  This is not going to go well.
[00:27:27.404 --> 00:27:31.927]  Lyme's disease has weaponized Rocky Mountain Fever from ticks.
[00:27:31.927 --> 00:27:33.007]  That's admitted.
[00:27:33.007 --> 00:27:35.509]  I mean, it's just like, wow!
[00:27:35.509 --> 00:27:35.849]  Wow!
[00:27:35.849 --> 00:27:39.212]  We're going to destroy ourselves if this doesn't stop.
[00:27:39.212 --> 00:27:46.476]  Of course, we've got more of the big epic fail compilations, more clips of Congress saying, shut down free speech, starting with info wars.
[00:27:46.476 --> 00:27:49.558]  I mean, you know, the Chinese communists meet in secret and talk about it.
[00:27:49.558 --> 00:27:51.320]  Here, they just say it on television.
[00:27:51.320 --> 00:27:51.800]  But briefly,
[00:27:53.401 --> 00:27:59.607]  We are doing a 34-hour global transmission right now on AM and FM stations, TV stations that pick us up, you name it.
[00:27:59.607 --> 00:28:02.470]  But the Internet's where we can really reach new people.
[00:28:02.470 --> 00:28:12.619]  So on Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, Infowars.com, Ford's last show, take the live video links to the 34-hour broadcast that we're now three and a half hours into.
[00:28:13.846 --> 00:28:17.608]  And send it out to everyone you know and say, this is the forbidden information.
[00:28:17.608 --> 00:28:20.590]  American rebirth and renaissance.
[00:28:20.590 --> 00:28:22.731]  One year after the historic victory.
[00:28:22.731 --> 00:28:25.033]  See what Democrats want banned.
[00:28:25.033 --> 00:28:27.414]  Find out the kryptonite they fear.
[00:28:27.414 --> 00:28:29.556]  Find out why they hate it so much.
[00:28:29.556 --> 00:28:30.796]  Be part of the rebellion.
[00:28:30.796 --> 00:28:33.098]  Every time you get excited, we do these live shows.
[00:28:33.098 --> 00:28:34.839]  We did one Saturday, only had like a million views.
[00:28:34.839 --> 00:28:36.280]  Which isn't bad for an internet-only thing.
[00:28:36.880 --> 00:28:37.881]  That's great, actually.
[00:28:37.881 --> 00:28:44.104]  But we've had these before where 10 million people tune in in just a few hours, 30-something million in a day extra.
[00:28:44.104 --> 00:28:51.728]  That's when you do a chain reaction that the globalists fear and spread the live video links on your own Twitter, Facebook, YouTube, email, and in person.
[00:28:51.728 --> 00:28:53.589]  So let's jam their operation!
[00:28:53.589 --> 00:28:54.029]  Attack!
[00:28:54.029 --> 00:28:54.430]  Attack!
[00:28:54.430 --> 00:28:54.870]  Attack!
[00:28:54.870 --> 00:28:55.450]  Attack!
[00:28:55.450 --> 00:28:55.930]  Attack!
[00:28:55.930 --> 00:28:56.551]  Attack!
[00:28:56.551 --> 00:28:56.911]  Attack!
[00:28:58.010 --> 00:29:01.331]  Hey, Daniel Brinkman, why NuMana storable foods?

[00:29:02.671 --> 00:29:06.092]  America needs strong, independent families to endure what's ahead.
[00:29:06.092 --> 00:29:07.632]  And we take this charge seriously.
[00:29:07.632 --> 00:29:08.673]  We got options.

[00:29:27.777 --> 00:29:30.418]  Most people think life insurance pays after you're dead.
[00:29:30.418 --> 00:29:31.419]  That's true.
[00:29:31.419 --> 00:29:36.482]  But did you know you can have tax-free access to your life insurance while you're still alive?
[00:29:36.482 --> 00:29:41.704]  You can use the life benefits of your life insurance to grow your money with certainty and guarantees.
[00:29:41.704 --> 00:29:45.886]  No stock market risk, no tax risk, and no penalties.

[00:29:49.908 --> 00:29:50.109]  That's 702-660-7000.
[00:29:59.651 --> 00:30:02.773]  America is an information-based civil war.
[00:30:02.773 --> 00:30:10.197]  That's why now more than ever, we've got to hit the streets of America and let these globalist scum know we're not backing down from their bullying.
[00:30:10.197 --> 00:30:15.801]  We're only intensifying our operations in the face of their wannabe dictatorship.
[00:30:16.561 --> 00:30:24.244]  Being a conservative, a nationalist, a libertarian, or simply a free speech advocate is truly the counterculture.
[00:30:24.244 --> 00:30:32.128]  The real punk rock is being a patriot who's pro-America, pro-capitalism, and pro-freedom, who at the same time is tolerant.
[00:30:32.828 --> 00:30:37.909]  Modern liberalism is a counterfeit of Thomas Jefferson's classical liberalism.
[00:30:37.909 --> 00:30:40.049]  They are the anti-liberals.
[00:30:40.049 --> 00:30:53.412]  To defend free speech, meet like-minded friends, and promote freedom worldwide, we've got more than 60 original designs of high-quality t-shirts for men and women, as well as more patriot apparel at InfoWarsTore.com.

[00:31:03.108 --> 00:31:10.770]  InfoWars Life brings you a revolutionary toothpaste blend with iodine and nano silver designed to deliver a powerful clean.
[00:31:10.770 --> 00:31:15.011]  Enjoy a minty fresh flavor made with peppermint oil or try our bubblegum flavor.

[00:31:20.572 --> 00:31:21.153]  I think so.

[00:31:44.913 --> 00:31:47.775]  Xylitol, Nano Silver, and Iodine.
[00:31:47.775 --> 00:31:51.397]  Notice the difference with our Super Blue Fluoride-Free products.

[00:31:56.380 --> 00:31:58.301]  That's InfoWarsStore.com.
[00:31:58.641 --> 00:32:02.085]  My fellow freedom lovers, Alex Jones here with a very important message.
[00:32:17.665 --> 00:32:30.676]  Really, really good news is that, yes, we're having to end the sale of 50% off on Anthroplex, but DNA Force, after almost four months, out of stock is back in stock, 25% off our flagship product.
[00:32:30.676 --> 00:32:35.520]  Also, Biome Defense, the great probiotic, that is 25% off as well.
[00:32:35.520 --> 00:32:39.584]  So a lot of things are selling out, but a lot of things are still at record sales.
[00:32:39.884 --> 00:32:41.645]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[00:33:16.213 --> 00:33:26.839]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWar.
[00:33:26.839 --> 00:33:29.181]  Alright, I'm not kidding.
[00:33:29.181 --> 00:33:32.983]  Scientists are implanting tiny human brains into rats.
[00:33:32.983 --> 00:33:35.805]  Mainstream media will probably run with that headline and say that I made it up.
[00:33:36.866 --> 00:33:37.226]  I didn't.
[00:33:37.226 --> 00:33:39.007]  It's out of the sun today.
[00:33:39.007 --> 00:33:45.170]  EPA approves bacteria-infected insects to kill mosquitoes and cause all sorts of serious chain reactions.
[00:33:45.170 --> 00:33:47.151]  That's coming up.
[00:33:47.151 --> 00:33:48.792]  Exclusive leak!
[00:33:48.792 --> 00:34:01.098]  Deep State to launch massive terror attacks in the United States using Yemeni-Islamic cutouts controlled by Deep State assets inside Saudi Arabia.
[00:34:01.098 --> 00:34:03.679]  Trump's been basically rolling up those groups.
[00:34:03.679 --> 00:34:04.380]  So the Deep State
[00:34:05.353 --> 00:34:09.415]  Our intel is, was connected to the Vegas attack using these groups.
[00:34:09.415 --> 00:34:14.076]  They launched an ICBM attack on Saudi Arabia's capital.
[00:34:14.076 --> 00:34:17.077]  There is just a lot of this unfolding.
[00:34:17.077 --> 00:34:18.158]  A lot of this going on.
[00:34:18.158 --> 00:34:26.181]  Now we're going to go to Roger Stone here in just a few minutes with what happened in Virginia and with what happened in, of course, New Jersey.
[00:34:26.181 --> 00:34:29.042]  Is it signaling the end of the global populist role?
[00:34:29.662 --> 00:34:32.945]  The answer is of course not, but the media is spinning that.
[00:34:32.945 --> 00:34:40.313]  We'll give you the cold hard facts in a moment, but we're having flashbacks to the campaign last year and to campaign night coming up next hour.
[00:34:40.313 --> 00:34:46.819]  We're going to air some of the MSNBC, CNN hosts when they got the word that Trump was going to win.
[00:34:48.103 --> 00:34:50.666]  Versus Infowars when we did.
[00:34:50.666 --> 00:34:54.349]  You can also just Google Alex Jones and Roger Stone toast Trump victory.
[00:34:54.349 --> 00:34:58.253]  They hate that champagne shot, believe me.
[00:34:58.253 --> 00:35:06.101]  That's why it's important to remember what we're fighting for, the fact that Trump has delivered, but the fact that they are gunning for all of us.
[00:35:06.101 --> 00:35:07.602]  We are in the thick of battle.
[00:35:07.602 --> 00:35:10.084]  But going back to the campaign itself, this
[00:35:10.865 --> 00:35:22.048]  Video ad we did, got about 20 million views on Facebook, a couple million on YouTube, just on our platforms, and really affected the campaign in a big way.
[00:35:22.048 --> 00:35:30.270]  You see, they lied about Barry Goldwater in 1960s and said that he wanted nuclear war with the Russians because he was a patriot.
[00:35:30.270 --> 00:35:38.113]  And they ran an ad, the little girl with the daisy, pulling the pedals off of the countdown to nuclear war, and a hydrogen bomb gets dropped on her.
[00:35:38.113 --> 00:35:39.393]  And it says, vote Johnson.
[00:35:40.674 --> 00:35:54.124]  Well, if you look at Hillary saying, I will bomb Iran, I want war, we're going to fund the Arab Spring, all the things she'd done in the past, attacking Serbia, Iraq, the list went on and on, that she was the one that really deserved an ad like this.
[00:35:54.124 --> 00:35:57.066]  So we made our own ad based on this.
[00:35:57.066 --> 00:35:59.107]  Deren McBreen did with Leanne McAdoo.
[00:35:59.107 --> 00:36:00.708]  It's pretty powerful.
[00:36:00.708 --> 00:36:01.148]  Here it is.
[00:36:02.202 --> 00:36:10.069]  The bottom line on nuclear weapons is that when the president gives the order, it must be followed.
[00:36:10.069 --> 00:36:17.996]  There's about four minutes between the order being given and the people responsible for launching nuclear weapons to do so.
[00:36:17.996 --> 00:36:20.078]  As president, I will make it clear.
[00:36:20.958 --> 00:36:26.282]  That the United States will treat cyber attacks just like any other attack.
[00:36:26.282 --> 00:36:31.686]  We will be ready with serious political, economic, and military responses.
[00:36:31.686 --> 00:36:35.248]  They're voting for peace on planet Earth if they vote for Trump.
[00:36:35.248 --> 00:36:38.111]  But if they vote for Hillary, it's war.
[00:36:38.111 --> 00:36:40.672]  We came, we saw, we died.
[00:36:43.058 --> 00:36:45.459]  With her, you'll end up in World War III.
[00:36:45.459 --> 00:36:49.141]  I want the Iranians to know that if I'm the president, we will attack Iran.
[00:36:49.141 --> 00:36:57.006]  Right now, Senator, for us to control all of the airspace in Syria would require us to go to war against Syria and Russia.
[00:36:58.925 --> 00:36:59.446]  The U.S.
[00:36:59.446 --> 00:37:03.409]  military has just raised the threat level to DEFCON 2.
[00:37:03.409 --> 00:37:11.416]  Meanwhile, Hillary Clinton is still threatening Russia with military action following unconfirmed reports of further hacking.
[00:37:11.416 --> 00:37:13.758]  It's like she's not even concerned about the repercussions.
[00:37:13.758 --> 00:37:17.421]  Of course not, because she's... Look, there's a really loud noise.
[00:37:17.421 --> 00:37:22.506]  Alright, looks like we're having a little bit of technical difficulties.
[00:37:22.506 --> 00:37:24.728]  We'll try to get Leanne back on in a few minutes.
[00:37:28.610 --> 00:37:32.955]  When the President gives the order, it must be followed.
[00:37:55.095 --> 00:37:56.617]  Mushroom clouds.
[00:37:56.617 --> 00:37:57.838]  November 4th.
[00:37:57.838 --> 00:38:03.803]  Vote like the world depends on it.
[00:38:03.803 --> 00:38:04.964]  And you did.
[00:38:04.964 --> 00:38:06.825]  Now, remember what they did.
[00:38:06.825 --> 00:38:21.097]  And I've got even New York Times here in my stack admitting that the same pollster companies that lied and said Hillary was going to win in a landslide are oversampling Democrats again, targeting Democrat voting pools for their polls.
[00:38:21.991 --> 00:38:28.513]  To create the illusion that Trump... Hell, let's just say Trump has a negative 5,000 instead of saying he's a 40.
[00:38:28.513 --> 00:38:37.117]  The bots, the Google AI systems, the Bloomberg business consoles, as they're called, have Trump at about 65 points right now.
[00:38:38.683 --> 00:38:40.583]  He's not having his support eroded.
[00:38:40.583 --> 00:38:44.825]  In fact, his presidency is succeeding now, and that's why they're panicking.
[00:38:44.825 --> 00:38:52.586]  And it's being confirmed that millions of people voted in the names of dead people, and over a million illegals, and everything's being verified.
[00:38:52.586 --> 00:38:53.567]  That's why they're panicking.
[00:38:53.567 --> 00:38:56.387]  So, how did they win New Jersey and Virginia?
[00:38:56.387 --> 00:38:57.968]  How did they run those governor's races?
[00:38:57.968 --> 00:38:59.408]  How did they do it?
[00:38:59.408 --> 00:39:05.850]  Well, here with the answer, not the spin, but the answer, he predicted this would happen, is Roger Stone.
[00:39:05.850 --> 00:39:06.530]  It's two-fold.
[00:39:07.349 --> 00:39:12.013]  He's going to break down the two-fold reasons why this happened.
[00:39:12.013 --> 00:39:16.317]  They're claiming it is a referendum on Americana and Trumpism.
[00:39:16.317 --> 00:39:17.438]  Is CNN lying to me?
[00:39:17.438 --> 00:39:20.061]  Because they never do that, Roger.
[00:39:20.061 --> 00:39:31.271]  No, Alex, I would have to concede that this is a crushing, stunning defeat for the old establishment Republican Party that despises Donald Trump.
[00:39:32.196 --> 00:39:51.185]  I would point out to you that Ed Gillespie, the Republican candidate in Virginia, former Republican National Chairman under George W. Bush, had George W. Bush actively visit the state and campaign for him, did not ask the president to campaign for him.
[00:39:51.185 --> 00:39:55.727]  At the grassroots, Tea Party activists, conservative activists,
[00:39:56.187 --> 00:40:06.336]  Trump supporters saw no particular reason to turn out despite a very poor campaign by the Democrat Alex.
[00:40:06.336 --> 00:40:12.941]  This was a repudiation of the rhino wing of the Republican Party.
[00:40:12.941 --> 00:40:18.646]  I would point out that President Trump did not carry Virginia in the 2016 election.
[00:40:18.646 --> 00:40:20.247]  So this is a wash.
[00:40:20.882 --> 00:40:23.263]  This is not a net loss.
[00:40:23.263 --> 00:40:34.049]  Now we turn to New Jersey, where this was sadly, even though he didn't particularly like this, a referendum on outgoing Governor Chris Christie.
[00:40:34.049 --> 00:40:40.613]  Christie could be today the single most unpopular governor in the United States.
[00:40:41.253 --> 00:40:55.481]  Again, Donald Trump did not visit the state, did not campaign for the Republican candidate, Lieutenant Governor Kim Gardano, who was inexorably linked to Christie.
[00:40:55.481 --> 00:40:57.342]  Pence did not campaign there.
[00:40:57.342 --> 00:40:59.143]  It was not a major thrust.
[00:40:59.443 --> 00:41:11.393]  Sure, these are both states that, I mean, these are areas that went for Clinton, and so that's why you're saying it is a wash and Trump has come out and said that Gilebsi did not embrace me or what I stand for.
[00:41:11.393 --> 00:41:14.355]  And again, you see populist candidates being elected all over the world.
[00:41:14.355 --> 00:41:18.498]  This is a global phenomenon against globalism, much bigger than these two races.
[00:41:18.498 --> 00:41:19.479]  That's why we see what?
[00:41:19.479 --> 00:41:23.042]  Eight other special elections where the outsider has won in every case.
[00:41:23.851 --> 00:41:34.375]  No, I think you make an excellent point, which is the Trump candidate has won in every special election we have had since his election.
[00:41:34.375 --> 00:41:41.757]  In the case of Alabama, Trumpism seems to have survived and thrived and succeeded without Trump himself.
[00:41:41.757 --> 00:41:46.899]  So reading too much into these two left-leaning states, blue states,
[00:41:47.359 --> 00:41:50.243]  Both of which did not go for the President.
[00:41:50.243 --> 00:41:53.427]  I'm trying to act like this is a giant setback for Trump.
[00:41:53.427 --> 00:41:55.970]  No, this is a setback for the Bushes.
[00:41:55.970 --> 00:42:00.475]  You know, you'd think that Gillespie... They're slowing the hands in an attempt to regain control of the party.
[00:42:00.475 --> 00:42:01.977]  Thwarted again.
[00:42:01.977 --> 00:42:05.221]  We had no investment in Ed Gillespie.
[00:42:05.221 --> 00:42:06.523]  He is not one of us.
[00:42:07.233 --> 00:42:16.875]  You'd think Ed Gillespie would know bringing in George W. Bush is like bringing in the kiss of death, or bringing in the black plague, or bringing in gonorrhea, bringing in... I mean, what's wrong with these people?
[00:42:18.021 --> 00:42:22.644]  No, I mean, look, George W. Bush literally crashed our economy.
[00:42:22.644 --> 00:42:36.832]  The housing meltdown, the foreign war based on a fake pretext of nuclear weapons in the hands of Saddam Hussein, that is a failed presidency and the American people have had it with the Bushes.
[00:42:36.832 --> 00:42:38.053]  They're done.
[00:42:38.053 --> 00:42:38.693]  Finished.
[00:42:38.693 --> 00:42:39.554]  Roger Stone.
[00:42:39.554 --> 00:42:41.615]  Read my book, The Bush Crime Family.
[00:42:41.755 --> 00:42:51.465]  That's right, you're going to be hosting the fourth hour, entering an hour of the war room, part of the 34-hour special coverage of flashback election 2016, the election heard round the world.
[00:42:51.465 --> 00:42:52.426]  Thank you, Roger.
[00:42:52.426 --> 00:42:54.528]  We'll talk to you again coming up in a few hours.
[00:42:54.528 --> 00:42:57.170]  We'll be right back with the impending terror attacks.

[00:47:01.639 --> 00:47:04.281]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:47:17.190 --> 00:47:23.738]  It's time for you men to stand up in the Info War and say, I don't know what's going to happen at the end of this, but you want to fight?
[00:47:23.738 --> 00:47:28.043]  You better believe you got one!
[00:47:28.043 --> 00:47:32.948]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[00:47:39.119 --> 00:47:52.608]  365 days ago, we were all tracking the latest numbers, seeing the fake polls, studying the actual sampling rate and knowing that Trump, barring massive election fraud, would end up being president.
[00:47:52.608 --> 00:47:58.752]  And despite the 5.7 million people who voted who were dead or were illegal aliens,
[00:48:00.117 --> 00:48:04.519]  That's way higher than what Trump said, 3.6 million or 3.7 million.
[00:48:04.519 --> 00:48:06.340]  That's the numbers he had last year.
[00:48:06.340 --> 00:48:23.948]  Despite that, despite state Department of Public Safety's groups in six states catching Homeland Security breaking into the computers electronically, remotely trying to steal the election, Hillary was only able to steal five states.
[00:48:23.948 --> 00:48:25.789]  And of course, she stole the nomination from Sanders.
[00:48:25.789 --> 00:48:27.010]  That's all public.
[00:48:27.010 --> 00:48:29.631]  Their whole house of cards is coming down.
[00:48:31.175 --> 00:48:36.121]  And they know, time and time again, InfoWars is patient zero.
[00:48:36.121 --> 00:48:38.584]  InfoWars is the first domino.
[00:48:38.584 --> 00:48:43.689]  InfoWars is the first to get the intel and punch it out there.
[00:48:43.689 --> 00:48:45.832]  That's why they fear us and they hate us.
[00:48:45.832 --> 00:48:51.578]  Last week, they were having congressional hearings after an Islamicist brought in on the diversity.
[00:48:52.495 --> 00:49:12.106]  Lottery, by Obama, by his program with Chuckie Schumer, plowed his vehicle into 8 people he killed, 11 he mortally, severely injured, some are still fighting for their lives, and they spun it that it was fake news that de Blasio had been warned and didn't do anything.
[00:49:14.517 --> 00:49:21.683]  And then we link to news articles and tweets and Fox News when the Imam was on, weeks before warning him.
[00:49:21.683 --> 00:49:27.567]  Remember he had people in his parades that were connected to cop killers and connected to Islamic groups.
[00:49:27.567 --> 00:49:30.530]  I mean, this is crazy.
[00:49:30.530 --> 00:49:35.334]  And the reason I raise this is, they're trying to shut us down.
[00:49:37.574 --> 00:49:46.604]  And that's why when you share the links to InfoWars.com, when you share the live feed for this 34-hour broadcast on Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, you're getting around there, bots.
[00:49:46.604 --> 00:49:47.805]  You're doing it by hand.
[00:49:47.805 --> 00:49:51.929]  When you tell folks at work or at church or wherever, it's changing the world.
[00:49:51.929 --> 00:49:55.073]  The data we've got, the intel we've got,
[00:49:56.576 --> 00:49:58.177]  It is the globalist number.
[00:49:58.177 --> 00:49:59.257]  And it's bringing them down.
[00:49:59.257 --> 00:50:00.058]  So spread the link.
[00:50:00.058 --> 00:50:02.039]  Infowars.com forward slash show.
[00:50:02.039 --> 00:50:06.341]  And we had a million extra people tune in on a special broadcast Saturday.
[00:50:06.341 --> 00:50:09.322]  And the regular show has 6, 7, 8 million people a day tuning in.
[00:50:09.322 --> 00:50:10.983]  People said, why do you care about a million on a Saturday?
[00:50:10.983 --> 00:50:12.444]  Because those are mainly new people.
[00:50:12.444 --> 00:50:13.504]  That's who we want.
[00:50:13.504 --> 00:50:16.566]  Our folks that are ready to be awakened but aren't yet.
[00:50:16.566 --> 00:50:20.448]  So that said, McBrain and others put together a little piece.
[00:50:20.448 --> 00:50:21.708]  Remember Veritas a month ago?
[00:50:21.708 --> 00:50:24.450]  They got the video where they said our main job is to shut down Alex Jones.
[00:50:26.271 --> 00:50:32.634]  Well then now we have Congress saying, and they have the heads of Twitter, Google, and Facebook admitting, yes sir, we saw him for at lunch.
[00:50:32.634 --> 00:50:35.555]  We blocked it, sir.
[00:50:35.555 --> 00:50:39.017]  This is sensational!
[00:50:39.017 --> 00:50:41.858]  This is the Streisand effect, if you take action.
[00:50:41.858 --> 00:50:43.139]  So here is this important piece.
[00:50:44.218 --> 00:50:46.460]  We confirm suspicions at Veritas.
[00:50:46.460 --> 00:50:53.067]  It's not a shock to you, but to get the employee at YouTube on tape admitting that they do it?
[00:50:53.067 --> 00:50:55.990]  I mean, you must be a threat if they call you out by name.
[00:50:55.990 --> 00:51:00.275]  It's also what happens when you listen to the radio host, Alex Jones.
[00:51:00.695 --> 00:51:24.442]  After just a short time ago, and I'm talking about when this meeting started, on Twitter, if you clicked on the hashtag, NYC terrorist attack, which is, quote, trending, marked with a red button saying, quote, live, the top tweet links to an InfoWars story with the headline, Imam, I warned de Blasio about New York City of terror.
[00:51:24.442 --> 00:51:26.083]  He was too busy bashing Trump.
[00:51:26.323 --> 00:51:36.509]  I don't know what happens in somebody's mind or how dark their heart must be to say things like that.
[00:51:36.509 --> 00:51:40.452]  This is a real-time example of when we talk about
[00:51:41.917 --> 00:51:43.879]  This information being weaponized.
[00:51:43.879 --> 00:51:46.542]  But Trump doesn't challenge these lies.
[00:51:46.542 --> 00:51:51.586]  He actually went on Jones' show and said, Your reputation's amazing.
[00:51:51.586 --> 00:51:53.088]  I will not let you down.
[00:51:53.088 --> 00:51:56.391]  You will be very, very impressed, I hope.
[00:51:56.391 --> 00:51:58.333]  How quickly can you act?
[00:51:58.333 --> 00:52:03.918]  And what's your responsibility to set the record straight so that the people who saw this
[00:52:05.248 --> 00:52:12.853]  Know that it's fake news and at least at some point in time it can't keep spreading like some sort of virus through the legitimate world.
[00:52:12.853 --> 00:52:19.918]  That's something we're thinking about all the time because it's a bad user experience and we don't want to be known as a platform for that.
[00:52:19.918 --> 00:52:21.779]  You have RT, you have Sputnik.
[00:52:22.439 --> 00:52:30.142]  You have Ruppley, and then I think you have them feeding other entities.
[00:52:30.142 --> 00:52:33.023]  InfoWars comes to mind, where those are echo chambers.
[00:52:33.023 --> 00:52:34.244]  The system self-corrected.
[00:52:34.244 --> 00:52:37.105]  That shouldn't be the first tweet you see anymore.
[00:52:37.105 --> 00:52:40.546]  It should be a USA article the last time I checked.
[00:52:40.546 --> 00:52:41.527]  But you saw this?
[00:52:41.527 --> 00:52:42.687]  USA Today.
[00:52:42.687 --> 00:52:43.948]  At lunch I did, yeah.
[00:52:43.948 --> 00:52:46.389]  And I also saw the system correct it.
[00:52:46.389 --> 00:52:47.309]  That man's a threat to this country.
[00:52:47.709 --> 00:52:49.330]  They didn't call out Fox News by name.
[00:52:49.330 --> 00:52:51.171]  They didn't call out anyone else by name.
[00:52:51.171 --> 00:52:58.814]  They said, when it comes to Alex Jones, we need people to scroll and manually find him and manually have to find that video.
[00:52:58.814 --> 00:53:07.178]  We're not going to allow that video, if it gets 10 million views, to be on the front of the so-called news carousel.
[00:53:07.178 --> 00:53:12.460]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[00:53:12.460 --> 00:53:13.621]  It's Alex Jones!
[00:53:15.438 --> 00:53:21.682]  Now I'm going to say this very slowly to the listeners because I know you've been in this battle a long time and you're the reason we're winning and we're in this together.
[00:53:21.682 --> 00:53:23.663]  But we are seen as a capital ship.
[00:53:23.663 --> 00:53:25.725]  That means a flagship in this fight.
[00:53:25.725 --> 00:53:28.606]  And we're the ones they're trying to shoot the rudder off of.
[00:53:28.606 --> 00:53:30.728]  We're the ship under main fire.
[00:53:30.728 --> 00:53:33.569]  And that's why we need you to financially support us.
[00:53:33.569 --> 00:53:38.933]  But to realize it's the information we cover that's got them on the run.
[00:53:38.933 --> 00:53:41.975]  Of course de Blasio was warned that jihad attacks were coming with trucks.
[00:53:43.311 --> 00:53:49.992]  Of course he's hurt by that, so they just say it's evil, ban InfoWars for saying the sky's blue.
[00:53:49.992 --> 00:54:03.795]  And then they have the head of operations for Twitter, who at lunch is shutting down a Paul Joseph Watson article and saying, sir, we put a USA Today article instead.
[00:54:03.795 --> 00:54:11.656]  Entrending, force feeding, rigging the whole thing with a weirdo who looks like a villain out of a movie named Quigley.
[00:54:12.571 --> 00:54:15.312]  Name Wigley!
[00:54:15.312 --> 00:54:18.254]  You got Piggly Wiggly at the House Intelligence Committee.
[00:54:18.254 --> 00:54:20.575]  This is why we're in so much trouble with people like this!
[00:54:20.575 --> 00:54:29.379]  And then they're having 2016 election hearings last Friday, and then just no evidence, no nothing.
[00:54:29.379 --> 00:54:32.001]  I'm a Russian agent, so I'm not human.
[00:54:32.001 --> 00:54:34.182]  I've got to be shut down.
[00:54:34.182 --> 00:54:35.943]  Because I'm the opposite of a Russian agent.
[00:54:35.943 --> 00:54:36.583]  Everybody knows it.
[00:54:37.512 --> 00:54:38.694]  Everybody knows.
[00:54:38.694 --> 00:54:40.997]  Everybody knows.
[00:54:40.997 --> 00:54:44.681]  Look, you don't get more Americana than in full wars.
[00:54:44.681 --> 00:54:47.084]  It just doesn't happen.
[00:54:47.084 --> 00:54:54.714]  Aggressive, freedom-based, committed, fearless, vicious, foaming at the mouth, creative, full of energy.
[00:54:54.714 --> 00:54:55.315]  That's America.
[00:54:59.315 --> 00:55:02.037]  And if they can shut us down, they can shut you down.
[00:55:02.037 --> 00:55:10.322]  That's why I need you to go to InfoWarsTore.com today during this 34-hour broadcast where we have the biggest sales we've run in probably six months.

[00:56:54.522 --> 00:56:57.883]  And ladies and gentlemen, we can only run these specials for the next few days.
[00:56:57.883 --> 00:57:00.765]  A lot of the other specials you notice are over now.
[00:57:00.765 --> 00:57:02.065]  We had to stop them.
[00:57:02.065 --> 00:57:04.746]  But there's no excuse at prices like this.
[00:57:04.746 --> 00:57:08.868]  I want you to wear the shirts to spread the word and the info war and meet like-minded people.
[00:57:08.868 --> 00:57:12.390]  I want you to get products a lot of you never tried and really see how good they are.

[00:57:14.651 --> 00:57:17.652]  This is the time to get super blue toothpaste and we have it for children.
[00:57:19.847 --> 00:57:27.430]  But whatever you do, commit to pray for the broadcast and commit to spread the word and commit to support our local affiliates.
[00:57:27.430 --> 00:57:29.611]  Whatever you do, spread the links.
[00:57:29.611 --> 00:57:32.372]  Infowars.com forward slash show.
[00:57:32.372 --> 00:57:33.272]  Everybody you know.
[00:57:33.272 --> 00:57:36.053]  Let's just not have a few million extra listeners and viewers today.
[00:57:36.053 --> 00:57:38.895]  Let's have it go super viral and defeat their algorithms.
[00:57:38.895 --> 00:57:40.915]  Let's rip the robots brains out.
[00:57:40.915 --> 00:57:42.416]  Let's smash the globalists.
[00:57:42.416 --> 00:57:43.336]  Let's win.
[00:57:43.336 --> 00:57:44.297]  Let's wake up.
[00:57:44.297 --> 00:57:45.637]  Let's rise.
[00:57:45.637 --> 00:57:46.898]  Yeah!
[00:57:46.898 --> 00:57:47.478]  Stay with us.
[00:57:48.038 --> 00:57:49.639]  Vitamin Mineral Fusion.

[00:58:37.259 --> 00:58:38.702]  That means it's clean.
[00:58:38.702 --> 00:58:39.825]  That means it's pure.
[00:58:39.825 --> 00:58:42.730]  And rest secured, you're finding the tip of the spear in the Infowar.
[00:58:42.730 --> 00:58:45.536]  That's InfowarsWimes.com and Vitamin Mineral Fusion.

[00:59:16.025 --> 00:59:19.547]  The larger the particle, the safer it is for your body.
[00:59:19.547 --> 00:59:23.669]  The organic oils help hydrate the skin, leaving it nice and smooth.

[00:59:51.562 --> 00:59:58.486]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:59:58.486 --> 01:00:03.568]  From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[01:00:05.905 --> 01:00:12.947]  We've got flashbacks coming up this hour from the leftists and the globalists, the elitists, when Trump won at 2.30 in the evening.
[01:00:12.947 --> 01:00:16.467]  Then we've got my little victory speech, where I said, watch, Trump's going to deliver.
[01:00:16.467 --> 01:00:18.288]  We've been proven right there.
[01:00:18.288 --> 01:00:20.628]  And we've got so much more.
[01:00:20.628 --> 01:00:27.190]  We've got live reporters on the ground with a big screaming fest, where the left's going to scream at the sky helplessly in their own words.
[01:00:27.190 --> 01:00:31.031]  But here are some excerpts of top Trump media meltdowns 365 days ago.
[01:00:33.288 --> 01:00:36.170]  This is the time for real wisdom.
[01:00:36.170 --> 01:00:37.371]  Lightning round.
[01:00:37.371 --> 01:00:41.335]  If Trump wins, how about bursting into tears and screaming fuck for the next 45 minutes?
[01:00:41.335 --> 01:00:43.196]  America is crying tonight.
[01:00:43.196 --> 01:00:49.261]  I'm not sure how much of America, but a very, very significant portion, and I mean literally crying.
[01:00:49.261 --> 01:00:53.425]  Everybody is crying and so upset, and it is the end of
[01:00:54.145 --> 01:00:55.066]  Their world.
[01:00:55.066 --> 01:00:56.346]  Feels like the end of the world.
[01:01:18.078 --> 01:01:20.040]  You're not having a terrible, terrible dream.
[01:01:20.040 --> 01:01:22.923]  Also, you're not dead and you haven't gone to hell.
[01:01:22.923 --> 01:01:23.844]  This is your life now.
[01:01:23.844 --> 01:01:24.825]  This is our election now.
[01:01:24.825 --> 01:01:25.445]  This is us.
[01:01:25.445 --> 01:01:26.186]  This is our country.
[01:01:26.186 --> 01:01:29.550]  This is a different Earth today than it was 24 hours ago.
[01:01:29.550 --> 01:01:31.772]  It's a different place.
[01:01:31.772 --> 01:01:33.153]  It just is different.
[01:01:33.153 --> 01:01:39.459]  The woman who President Obama called the most qualified person ever to run for the White House couldn't break through.
[01:01:39.459 --> 01:01:41.061]  The question remains, who can?
[01:01:41.121 --> 01:01:46.525]  That deeper concerns tonight that the world's shining light of democracy has gone dark.
[01:01:46.525 --> 01:01:51.488]  Decency lost last night and that's what's so hurtful about this.
[01:01:51.488 --> 01:01:53.549]  This was a white lash.
[01:01:53.549 --> 01:01:56.872]  This was a white lash against a changing country.
[01:01:57.572 --> 01:02:01.413]  It was a white lash against a black president, in part.
[01:02:01.413 --> 01:02:04.094]  And that's the part where the pain comes.
[01:02:04.094 --> 01:02:10.796]  I kind of push back against the advancement of African Americans, of Hispanics, of women, of Muslim Americans.
[01:02:10.796 --> 01:02:17.878]  It is a mourning moment for those people, and it is a moment filled with fear.
[01:02:17.878 --> 01:02:20.899]  I'm on this network and people know my attitudes about things.
[01:02:20.899 --> 01:02:27.241]  They come up to me and they're scared, depressed, despaired, desperate even, almost clinging to me.
[01:02:27.381 --> 01:02:29.322]  It was a rough night for everybody, I think.
[01:02:29.322 --> 01:02:30.062]  Yeah, we're worried.
[01:02:30.062 --> 01:02:31.163]  The people are worried, you know?
[01:02:31.163 --> 01:02:32.663]  Okay, he's the president, now what?
[01:02:32.663 --> 01:02:37.526]  It feels like we're trying to avoid the apocalypse and half of the country is voting for the asteroid.
[01:02:37.526 --> 01:02:41.648]  Is there a doomsday plan for a time like this?
[01:02:41.648 --> 01:02:43.708]  Am I right to ask about a doomsday plan?
[01:02:43.708 --> 01:02:45.389]  Do you see this as a doomsday scenario?
[01:02:45.389 --> 01:02:54.173]  So if Donald Trump is democratically elected and your son is serving as a Marine, you wouldn't trust his life under that commander-in-chief?
[01:02:54.173 --> 01:02:55.414]  And Kane said, I wouldn't.
[01:02:56.174 --> 01:02:59.695]  That's a pretty extraordinary thing to say.
[01:02:59.695 --> 01:03:03.496]  If you have a son in the Marine Corps and that you don't trust the Commander-in-Chief.
[01:03:03.496 --> 01:03:07.037]  The people in the military defend the Constitution.
[01:03:07.037 --> 01:03:13.938]  I can't put a happy face on that.
[01:03:13.938 --> 01:03:15.199]  And that's my job.
[01:03:15.199 --> 01:03:20.260]  This is the first time throughout this entire race where I'm officially shitting my pants.
[01:03:21.613 --> 01:03:26.955]  I genuinely do not understand how America can be this disorganized or this hateful.
[01:03:26.955 --> 01:03:31.877]  How do you govern when your whole campaign was built on the hatred of somebody else?
[01:03:31.877 --> 01:03:38.500]  From slavery to, you know, Nazism, we have faced challenges before to who we are as a people.
[01:03:38.500 --> 01:03:40.721]  Plus the Supreme Court, who knows where that's going to go.
[01:03:40.721 --> 01:03:45.583]  So the only checks and balances we have are us, The View.
[01:03:45.583 --> 01:03:46.983]  How are you supposed to be able to handle the country?
[01:03:51.149 --> 01:03:53.810]  Handle a pussy!
[01:03:53.810 --> 01:03:54.731]  It's not hard!
[01:03:54.731 --> 01:03:56.172]  You learn it in, like, middle school!
[01:03:56.172 --> 01:03:58.693]  She did the best ad campaign, the best ground game.
[01:03:58.693 --> 01:04:01.314]  This is a shot against meritocracy, I think.
[01:04:01.314 --> 01:04:06.216]  Because she merited everything, and the normal way you standardize these things, she did what she was supposed to do to win.
[01:04:06.216 --> 01:04:12.019]  You know, she was Hillary Clinton, the most qualified candidate, the best suited for the job, the best temperament.
[01:04:12.019 --> 01:04:13.360]  Now we're hearing, not a good candidate.
[01:04:13.360 --> 01:04:15.321]  History is put on hold yet again.
[01:04:15.401 --> 01:04:17.382]  We have no idea who won.
[01:04:17.382 --> 01:04:20.004]  And to cover our bases, we taped two different show opens.
[01:04:20.004 --> 01:04:22.365]  First up, here's the outcome I'm hoping for.
[01:04:22.365 --> 01:04:36.274]  Hillary Clinton is the next president of the United States.
[01:04:36.274 --> 01:04:42.939]  But just in case the unthinkable has happened and Donald Trump is our new president, the show open would look something like this.
[01:04:47.279 --> 01:04:57.865]  Oh, hello!
[01:04:57.865 --> 01:05:00.987]  America is an information-based civil war.
[01:05:00.987 --> 01:05:08.431]  That's why now more than ever, we've got to hit the streets of America and let these globalist scum know we're not backing down from their bullying.
[01:05:08.431 --> 01:05:14.014]  We're only intensifying our operations in the face of their wannabe dictatorship.
[01:05:14.794 --> 01:05:22.439]  Being a conservative, a nationalist, a libertarian, or simply a free speech advocate is truly the counterculture.
[01:05:22.439 --> 01:05:30.325]  The real punk rock is being a patriot who's pro-America, pro-capitalism, and pro-freedom, who at the same time is tolerant.
[01:05:31.045 --> 01:05:36.106]  Modern liberalism is a counterfeit of Thomas Jefferson's classical liberalism.
[01:05:36.106 --> 01:05:38.246]  They are the anti-liberals.
[01:05:38.246 --> 01:05:51.629]  To defend free speech, meet like-minded friends, and promote freedom worldwide, we've got more than 60 original designs of high-quality t-shirts for men and women, as well as more patriot apparel at InfoWarsTore.com.
[01:05:51.629 --> 01:05:55.250]  Be part of the Second American Revolution at InfoWarsTore.com.
[01:06:01.886 --> 01:06:04.900]  Remember, we've seen the end of the Clintons.
[01:06:04.900 --> 01:06:06.688]  We'll soon see the end of the globalists.
[01:06:21.916 --> 01:06:29.386]  It's also what happens when you listen to the radio host, Alex Jones.
[01:06:29.386 --> 01:06:31.228]  Move, bitch!
[01:06:31.228 --> 01:06:32.030]  Get out the way!
[01:06:37.811 --> 01:06:40.232]  The red flag is the American flag.
[01:06:40.232 --> 01:06:44.793]  Infowars helped fuel the rumor that President Obama is an ISIS supporter.
[01:06:44.793 --> 01:06:48.054]  It's been a cozy relationship from the beginning.
[01:06:48.054 --> 01:06:49.755]  I will not let you down.
[01:06:49.755 --> 01:06:52.776]  You'll be very, very impressed, I hope.
[01:06:52.776 --> 01:06:54.396]  And I think we'll be speaking a lot.
[01:06:54.396 --> 01:06:56.417]  Donald Trump and Alex Jones.
[01:06:56.417 --> 01:07:02.139]  This means that Donald Trump will be the 45th President of the United States.
[01:07:02.139 --> 01:07:04.720]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:07:04.720 --> 01:07:05.920]  It's Alex Jones!
[01:07:08.246 --> 01:07:15.155]  Alright, coming up in the next segment, I'm going to air just some excerpts from live and continued coverage at 2 in the morning.
[01:07:15.919 --> 01:07:20.783]  When Trump came and gave his celebration victory speech.
[01:07:20.783 --> 01:07:28.588]  We're going to air some excerpts of that from when I and Roger Stone were sitting here in this very studio 365 days ago.
[01:07:28.588 --> 01:07:32.631]  Or a little less than 364 and a half days ago.
[01:07:32.631 --> 01:07:38.416]  But we're going to relive all that tonight with live coverage throughout the evening with myself, Leanne McAdoo.
[01:07:39.833 --> 01:07:49.360]  David Knight, Paul Joseph Watson, Darren McBreen, Rob Dew, Michael Zimmerman, Millie Weaver, I mean the list goes on and on.
[01:07:49.360 --> 01:07:53.563]  Jake Lloyd, I obviously can't list everybody here.
[01:07:53.563 --> 01:07:58.527]  And I'll be on tonight at 8 o'clock nearing that for what's basically commercial free.
[01:07:58.527 --> 01:08:07.794]  We'll play some promos and have some breaks, but it's just free to air to radio stations and TV stations that we're on satellite TV affiliates already with.
[01:08:09.144 --> 01:08:11.265]  I'm going to do a Reddit Ask Me Anything.
[01:08:11.265 --> 01:08:12.225]  I haven't done that in about a year.
[01:08:12.225 --> 01:08:15.987]  I also did that last year on election night.
[01:08:15.987 --> 01:08:17.768]  I think the day before election night.
[01:08:17.768 --> 01:08:22.390]  So we're going to repeat that with a Reddit Ask Me Anything on the Donald.
[01:08:22.390 --> 01:08:26.312]  That is coming up as well tonight.
[01:08:26.312 --> 01:08:28.893]  We have 34 hours of live continued coverage.
[01:08:28.893 --> 01:08:36.597]  I need to hit some other geopolitical news and some really serious issues here before we get back into celebrating the one year anniversary of Trump.
[01:08:36.597 --> 01:08:37.357]  But I got to say this.
[01:08:40.029 --> 01:08:53.454]  People really are looking a gift horse in the mouth if they don't thank God for what's happening with Trump.
[01:08:53.454 --> 01:09:04.918]  Because he has appointed a lot of swamp creatures, but also a lot of good people, to government that are carrying out the restoration of this republic.
[01:09:04.918 --> 01:09:07.399]  But the only argument is, well, Trump's appointed some people
[01:09:08.595 --> 01:09:10.416]  That were for Goldman Sachs or this or that.
[01:09:10.416 --> 01:09:15.358]  Where do you think you get people at the highest levels to run things who know how the system works?
[01:09:15.358 --> 01:09:17.138]  That's where you get them.
[01:09:17.138 --> 01:09:23.541]  What I care about is the results, but the people he's putting in at the Fed are anti-globalist.
[01:09:23.541 --> 01:09:25.801]  EPA, anti-globalist.
[01:09:25.801 --> 01:09:29.643]  Over the Federal Trade Commission, anti-globalist.
[01:09:29.643 --> 01:09:33.924]  He's killing land grabs, water grabs out west and across the country.
[01:09:33.924 --> 01:09:37.886]  He's reversing the regulations, fighting like the devil.
[01:09:39.264 --> 01:09:48.369]  To try to cut taxes across the board and make us competitive, turning our energy back on, bringing our coal-powered plants back?
[01:09:48.369 --> 01:09:52.152]  That is so fundamental right there alone that it makes my head spin.
[01:09:52.152 --> 01:09:56.514]  In fact, there's so much data I get lost in translation.
[01:09:56.514 --> 01:10:00.356]  Paul Watson did an article a few months ago titled,
[01:10:01.667 --> 01:10:05.429]  The first 100 days of Trump and it's got like 50 things Trump did.
[01:10:05.429 --> 01:10:06.810]  The White House put one out too.
[01:10:06.810 --> 01:10:08.972]  I should probably get that over some of those on air.
[01:10:08.972 --> 01:10:12.334]  And then what's happened since then as well.
[01:10:12.334 --> 01:10:18.618]  And also, you know, we go into these big productions and I kind of preach to the crew here on air in a good way.
[01:10:18.618 --> 01:10:20.059]  But everything's transparent here.
[01:10:20.059 --> 01:10:21.940]  You know, you spend months making something.
[01:10:21.940 --> 01:10:25.142]  We're going to air it.
[01:10:25.142 --> 01:10:29.245]  Walker did a great job putting together like a hour long documentary.
[01:10:31.394 --> 01:10:33.595]  And I said, listen, we're way past the first hundred days.
[01:10:33.595 --> 01:10:34.736]  You got to finish it someday.
[01:10:34.736 --> 01:10:36.477]  And he said, well, there's so many accomplishments.
[01:10:36.477 --> 01:10:37.877]  And I said, I know.
[01:10:37.877 --> 01:10:39.398]  Just pick the big ones.
[01:10:39.398 --> 01:10:41.359]  So next break, I just remembered that.
[01:10:41.359 --> 01:10:43.140]  I'm going to go over there and say, where is that?
[01:10:43.140 --> 01:10:45.121]  Because we're going to air it.
[01:10:45.121 --> 01:10:46.241]  That's how this works.
[01:10:46.241 --> 01:10:49.583]  We're going to put the stuff out there.
[01:10:49.583 --> 01:10:52.765]  Because there's so much amazing stuff gets produced here that you never see.
[01:10:52.765 --> 01:10:54.025]  Not by conspiracy.
[01:10:54.025 --> 01:10:59.288]  It's just that we work on something, work on something, and then so much happens, we never get back to the other stuff that's so important.
[01:11:00.356 --> 01:11:04.577]  So throughout the next 30 plus hours, it's a 34 hour broadcast.
[01:11:04.577 --> 01:11:06.178]  We're about four hours into it now.
[01:11:06.178 --> 01:11:13.280]  David Knight did three hours kicking it off this morning with the real news as he does a great job every weekday morning at 8 a.m.
[01:11:13.280 --> 01:11:19.902]  But that's what you're going to be seeing is our best promos, our best pieces, our best mini documentaries that have never aired.
[01:11:21.553 --> 01:11:41.665]  And just a lot of powerful info, your calls, special guests, all of it, InfoWars.com forward slash show, and on local stations across the country, some of which are picking us up 24 hours live today, and that's why we're being good boys and girls and not using any potty language.
[01:11:41.665 --> 01:11:48.009]  Now, let me get to the really serious news here.
[01:11:48.009 --> 01:11:48.850]  There is an individual
[01:11:52.048 --> 01:12:00.074]  Who recently got out of the Army and Special Operations Command out of Florida.
[01:12:00.074 --> 01:12:07.499]  Who's been calling in the last year or so with just really accurate information.
[01:12:07.499 --> 01:12:16.405]  The reason I know it's accurate information is because I do my own research.
[01:12:16.405 --> 01:12:20.488]  He was going to come on about two weeks ago, officially as a guest.
[01:12:22.725 --> 01:12:35.390]  And he got called in by the military to I guess drive into Tampa and be questioned about what he was going to talk about on the show.
[01:12:35.390 --> 01:12:39.732]  And so he said, OK, I won't do the interview.
[01:12:39.732 --> 01:12:45.895]  Then he called back in some more in the last week and talked about a lot of really important things.
[01:12:45.895 --> 01:12:49.616]  And he said, OK, I'll come on your show tomorrow.
[01:12:49.616 --> 01:12:51.617]  Within two hours, the FBI showed up at his door.
[01:12:53.320 --> 01:12:56.542]  And took him away to the military.
[01:12:56.542 --> 01:12:59.384]  And they let him call his lawyer, and they let him call us.
[01:12:59.384 --> 01:13:01.465]  And he sent us a message.
[01:13:01.465 --> 01:13:03.867]  And by the way, we know who this individual is.
[01:13:03.867 --> 01:13:08.329]  We've confirmed from others that this is happening.
[01:13:08.329 --> 01:13:13.893]  And we've been basically told we ought to watch what we're doing, too.
[01:13:13.893 --> 01:13:17.375]  Now, you've seen major persecution of the press under Obama.
[01:13:17.375 --> 01:13:21.557]  But why is Zach, who's now a contractor, doing all this?
[01:13:22.580 --> 01:13:24.621]  Zach who speaks Arabic fluently.
[01:13:24.621 --> 01:13:27.003]  I'll just leave it at that.
[01:13:27.003 --> 01:13:31.285]  Zach who's actually been in the news before.
[01:13:31.285 --> 01:13:33.486]  Zach who's well-known.
[01:13:33.486 --> 01:13:34.667]  I'm gonna stop right there.
[01:13:34.667 --> 01:13:40.771]  His first name's Zachary.
[01:13:40.771 --> 01:13:44.433]  There is a civil war going on in the Middle East between Shiite and Sunni.
[01:13:44.433 --> 01:13:45.794]  There's a civil war within
[01:13:47.793 --> 01:14:03.198]  The heart of Islam, Saudi Arabia and Mecca, they're in Riyadh and Medina, between the Royal House and the globalist arm that funded ISIS and Al Qaeda, Trump went over there, made a deal, said no more funny business, shut it down, the U.S.
[01:14:03.198 --> 01:14:06.460]  policy of funding radical jihadis is over.
[01:14:06.460 --> 01:14:15.923]  The king came to the table, they parlayed, and they made a deal that there were raids in Yemen to get the documents to be able to roll up the networks
[01:14:17.298 --> 01:14:22.582]  So he could present the King with the evidence of who was double-crossing him with Iran and others.
[01:14:22.582 --> 01:14:28.027]  Now we told you that Saturday night with Roger Stone, he talked to a very high up person in the White House.
[01:14:28.027 --> 01:14:29.768]  Very high up.
[01:14:29.768 --> 01:14:33.111]  About as high as you can go in the White House.
[01:14:33.111 --> 01:14:35.753]  The point is, and we told you what was behind it.
[01:14:35.753 --> 01:14:37.455]  It's all come out in the news now.
[01:14:37.455 --> 01:14:39.456]  Zach just echoes that info.
[01:14:39.456 --> 01:14:40.597]  Didn't give us anything secret.
[01:14:40.597 --> 01:14:44.921]  Told us as an intelligence analyst and a guy that's been involved heavily
[01:14:45.902 --> 01:14:48.363]  And a lot of obviously clandestine stuff.
[01:14:48.363 --> 01:14:50.644]  That's why they don't want him talking to us.
[01:14:50.644 --> 01:14:52.324]  They're afraid of what he will say.
[01:14:52.324 --> 01:14:53.525]  I already know basically all of it.
[01:14:53.525 --> 01:14:54.505]  I don't need to get it from him.
[01:14:54.505 --> 01:14:56.846]  I've already reverse engineered the whole thing.
[01:14:56.846 --> 01:15:05.970]  But there's a civil war spilling over and the Saudis were having a military convention in Vegas when that happened.
[01:15:05.970 --> 01:15:06.770]  We were already on that.
[01:15:08.226 --> 01:15:08.426]  I think?
[01:15:24.474 --> 01:15:24.634]  Is it?
[01:15:44.156 --> 01:15:53.200]  If they were ever decapitated, and that's about to happen, and he wanted to warn everybody of an impending Yemeni terror attack in the West and the US.
[01:15:53.200 --> 01:15:55.621]  And right now he's locked up in a military base, basically.
[01:15:56.266 --> 01:16:02.790]  KD Armor has been on a mission to manufacture the most comfortable body armor on the market, and we've succeeded.

[01:18:01.663 --> 01:18:06.945]  Because people are actually waking up to the problem that pretty much scares me the most.
[01:18:06.945 --> 01:18:20.488]  I mean, I try to make sure that I don't put toxins from food and water and beverages in my system, but right now we're dealing with massive parasites, which is anything that's harmful to your body that lives off a host mechanism.
[01:18:20.488 --> 01:18:21.849]  Right now with all the refugees,
[01:18:22.629 --> 01:18:24.290]  Uh, spreading disease around.
[01:18:24.290 --> 01:18:26.852]  We have biological warfare going on everywhere.
[01:18:26.852 --> 01:18:28.153]  These are all parasites.
[01:18:28.153 --> 01:18:29.273]  Tell us about all the stuff that's in it.
[01:18:29.273 --> 01:18:30.594]  There's so many things that are in it.
[01:18:30.594 --> 01:18:31.875]  You have the neem in there.
[01:18:31.875 --> 01:18:35.097]  You have the organic clove bud, the organic wormwood.
[01:18:35.097 --> 01:18:38.239]  I recommend doing a parasite cleanse at least twice a year.
[01:18:38.239 --> 01:18:41.441]  All right, well, I'm glad we've got some back in because I'm going back on it today.
[01:18:41.441 --> 01:18:42.502]  It just came back in yesterday.
[01:18:42.502 --> 01:18:43.322]  Living Defense.
[01:18:43.322 --> 01:18:44.423]  Infowarslife.com.
[01:18:44.423 --> 01:18:45.464]  And folks, you can't lose.
[01:18:45.464 --> 01:18:48.166]  It's full of stuff that's great for your body, period.
[01:18:48.166 --> 01:18:48.366]  And, uh,
[01:18:49.026 --> 01:18:50.066]  You support the broadcast.
[01:18:50.066 --> 01:18:51.407]  Infowarslives.com.
[01:18:51.407 --> 01:18:53.648]  Thank you, Dr. Group from the Global Healing Center.
[01:18:53.648 --> 01:18:56.949]  Thank you so much for all your work, sir, on this great product.
[01:18:56.949 --> 01:19:00.710]  My fellow freedom lovers, Alex Jones here with a very important message.
[01:19:00.710 --> 01:19:06.172]  Secret 12, 40% off the best vitamin B12 out there from our research.
[01:19:06.172 --> 01:19:07.153]  Take it under the tongue.
[01:19:07.153 --> 01:19:08.093]  Simply amazing.
[01:19:08.093 --> 01:19:09.754]  That sale is continuing.
[01:19:09.754 --> 01:19:13.095]  Supramel Vitality for stamina, libido, energy.
[01:19:13.095 --> 01:19:14.115]  That's 30% off.
[01:19:14.115 --> 01:19:15.256]  That's continuing.
[01:19:15.256 --> 01:19:15.736]  And the other
[01:19:15.976 --> 01:19:27.386]  Really, really good news is that yes, we're having to end the sale of 50% off on Anthroplex, but DNA Force, after almost four months of stock, is back in stock.
[01:19:27.386 --> 01:19:28.987]  25% off our flagship product.
[01:19:28.987 --> 01:19:33.832]  Also, Biome Defense, the great probiotic, that is 25% off as well.
[01:19:33.832 --> 01:19:35.173]  So a lot of things are selling out.
[01:19:35.493 --> 01:19:38.194]  A lot of things are still at record sales.
[01:19:38.194 --> 01:19:42.497]  White Silver Bullet, super high quality colloidal silver is still 50% off.
[01:19:42.497 --> 01:19:46.599]  And there's other sales that are still going, but they're all about to end.
[01:19:46.599 --> 01:19:53.242]  Whether it's DNA Force, whether it's Silver Bullet, it's all available right now at InfoWarsLife.com or by calling toll-free, 888-253-3139.
[01:19:53.242 --> 01:19:55.223]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[01:20:13.573 --> 01:20:17.978]  You are listening to an InfoWars.com frontline report.
[01:20:17.978 --> 01:20:21.842]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[01:20:29.452 --> 01:20:39.099]  From deep in the heart of FEMA Region 6, Austin, Texas, transmitting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[01:20:39.099 --> 01:20:46.905]  We're now about three and a half hours, four and a half hours into the live 34-hour worldwide coverage of the American rebirth and renaissance.
[01:20:49.110 --> 01:20:55.553]  We have a lot of callers to the broadcast, but one caller in the last year became personally known to us as who he said he was.
[01:20:55.553 --> 01:21:02.235]  Someone who'd worked in intelligence operations against different radical jihad organizations across the world.
[01:21:02.235 --> 01:21:04.156]  And he never gave us anything classified on air.
[01:21:04.156 --> 01:21:09.938]  He just pointed out things that were already in public knowledge, but that we should connect the dots on.
[01:21:09.938 --> 01:21:13.180]  And he was going to come on as a guest today and announced on air he would.
[01:21:14.656 --> 01:21:25.270]  We confirmed, of course, in the last few weeks exactly who he was, and he is a whistleblower saying that Deep State, left over from before Trump, was running Al Qaeda and ISIS.
[01:21:25.270 --> 01:21:27.352]  There's a civil war in Saudi Arabia.
[01:21:27.352 --> 01:21:31.057]  Trump is moving with the Saudi king to clean that up and end that.
[01:21:31.758 --> 01:21:47.147]  Democrats and globalists, and John McCain namely, are using that breakaway network of Yemenis, terrorists and others in Europe and the US to prepare new attacks in Saudi Arabia and here, and that those attacks are imminent.
[01:21:47.147 --> 01:21:53.211]  Now, within an hour and a half of him getting off the air, the FBI came to his house,
[01:21:54.187 --> 01:21:57.731]  And took him to a military base.
[01:21:57.731 --> 01:22:01.655]  He was able to call his lawyer and send a message, and send us a message.
[01:22:01.655 --> 01:22:04.598]  And I have the messages right here, and we talked to him.
[01:22:04.598 --> 01:22:13.127]  So, it's not to the point where they put a bag over his head, but they took all his computers, everything, looking for him, giving any classified material away, so they can throw him in prison.
[01:22:15.276 --> 01:22:26.738]  And this individual has been a whistleblower before, like Tosh Plumlee, was a famous CIA contractor and exposed everything about Benghazi on this show first.
[01:22:26.738 --> 01:22:29.419]  They called him and threatened to put him in prison.
[01:22:29.419 --> 01:22:35.120]  He said, go ahead and do it.
[01:22:35.120 --> 01:22:41.682]  In this case, they have grabbed Zachary, who's asked us not to give out his full name and information.
[01:22:41.682 --> 01:22:43.422]  If we did give out his full name and information,
[01:22:44.491 --> 01:22:52.380]  He's well known in the military, honorable guy, but has been involved exposing corruption before.
[01:22:52.380 --> 01:22:55.924]  So, this is very, very credible.
[01:22:55.924 --> 01:23:00.629]  And the media out there making jokes about this, listen, this is serious.
[01:23:00.629 --> 01:23:03.332]  Because he exposed connections to the Vegas attacks.
[01:23:04.707 --> 01:23:10.989]  To the breakaway rogue Saudi groups that are backing Yemeni terrorists and others and gun deals.
[01:23:10.989 --> 01:23:17.472]  Confirming our own research and our own data from FBI sources and others.
[01:23:17.472 --> 01:23:18.972]  Now there's a civil war going on.
[01:23:18.972 --> 01:23:24.834]  A missile fired at the International Airport in Saudi Arabia in Riyadh.
[01:23:24.834 --> 01:23:27.415]  Firefights, helicopter explosions, deaths.
[01:23:27.415 --> 01:23:31.517]  The whole globalist pro-ISIS, pro-Al Qaeda network is being
[01:23:32.984 --> 01:23:37.749]  rolled up right now is being taken out.
[01:23:37.749 --> 01:23:44.975]  The globalist arm funding and running radical Wahhabism is being destroyed by President Trump.
[01:23:44.975 --> 01:23:56.366]  And so this patriot calls in to say his sources and his research and his intel, and that's what he does now as a citizen, telling the American people, I mean, his intellect isn't classified.
[01:23:57.858 --> 01:23:59.820]  Well, we really do have no First Amendment.
[01:23:59.820 --> 01:24:11.289]  That Yemenis terrorists have been decapitated, their leadership's gone, but they've got dead man switches, which is standard, to launch terror attacks, and people need to know that.
[01:24:11.289 --> 01:24:15.052]  And the deep state wants to embarrass Trump with more terror attacks.
[01:24:15.052 --> 01:24:17.994]  And it's all connected to the Antifa.
[01:24:17.994 --> 01:24:23.599]  This individual, Devin Kelly, in mental institutions, the Air Force put him in.
[01:24:25.683 --> 01:24:29.329]  Trying to go to bases with guns to kill his commanding officers.
[01:24:29.329 --> 01:24:31.773]  That's the Associated Press and CBS News.
[01:24:31.773 --> 01:24:37.062]  And protected and allowed to assault his wife and other people and children and to be a pedophile.
[01:24:38.362 --> 01:24:39.683]  And then protected?
[01:24:39.683 --> 01:24:41.184]  And then turned loose?
[01:24:41.184 --> 01:24:45.427]  You know, he was told, you're our little secret agent now, the Deep State.
[01:24:45.427 --> 01:24:46.928]  You're not gonna go to jail.
[01:24:46.928 --> 01:24:48.669]  Don't kill your commanding officers.
[01:24:48.669 --> 01:24:50.430]  We have a job for you.
[01:24:50.430 --> 01:25:06.000]  And just like a wind-up toy, right out of a government mental institutions, allowed to get guns, the files, not put into the NICS system, on purpose, so their wind-up toy, classic Manchurian candidate.
[01:25:06.000 --> 01:25:08.042]  Let's put Devin Kelly on screen.
[01:25:09.483 --> 01:25:11.224]  And what did our source start talking about yesterday?
[01:25:11.224 --> 01:25:17.647]  He said, I can't get into this, and I can't get into him, and I can't get into his background, but it's all in the news.
[01:25:17.647 --> 01:25:19.588]  And absolutely, there it is.
[01:25:19.588 --> 01:25:21.429]  Mind control.
[01:25:22.861 --> 01:25:26.842]  If they can't hype up a revolution on November 4th, they'll activate their sleeper cells.
[01:25:26.842 --> 01:25:31.023]  And let me tell you something, they got hardcore drugs, they got programming, they got it all.
[01:25:31.023 --> 01:25:40.005]  And the proof is, they put him in a mental institution for trying to kill his chain of command with weapons, and they let him out, and then they let him continue to attack people and did nothing.
[01:25:40.005 --> 01:25:49.947]  They protected him, just like Major Hassan at Fort Hood for two years was talking to the number two in Al Qaeda about his attacks, and the CIA knew and did nothing.
[01:25:51.994 --> 01:25:55.497]  Because they're, look at that mind control, look at that guy.
[01:25:55.497 --> 01:25:58.819]  I bet if he did an autopsy, he's been under electroshock therapy, you name it.
[01:25:58.819 --> 01:26:04.804]  That guy tried to kill his high command, and they said, put this guy into a black project, scramble his brain.
[01:26:04.804 --> 01:26:07.726]  This guy's a perfect candidate as a wind-up toy.
[01:26:07.726 --> 01:26:09.848]  You wanna be a killer, son?
[01:26:09.848 --> 01:26:12.690]  You're gonna get to be a killer now!
[01:26:12.690 --> 01:26:14.931]  You're in the program whether you like it or not!
[01:26:14.931 --> 01:26:19.435]  And that's how the ball bounces.
[01:26:21.547 --> 01:26:23.571]  And that's why they grabbed Zachary up.
[01:26:23.571 --> 01:26:28.381]  Because Zachary knows how the cow ate the cabbage.
[01:26:28.381 --> 01:26:30.485]  And that, my friends, is the rest of the story.
[01:26:30.485 --> 01:26:32.389]  If you just joined us, imminent!
[01:26:33.464 --> 01:26:45.348]  Yemenis terrorist backed by break-off splinter groups of the CIA tied to the old Clinton globalist Obama guard and John McCain who funded all these terror attacks across the world.
[01:26:45.348 --> 01:26:53.991]  Vandar Bush who told Russia four years ago if you get involved in Syria we'll launch terror attacks against your terrorist zones and they've been hit now.
[01:26:55.196 --> 01:27:01.024]  The whole thing's right there and the same message they gave Russia is the same message they gave Trump.
[01:27:01.024 --> 01:27:05.330]  You roll over and you back off or we're going to blow up casinos.
[01:27:05.330 --> 01:27:07.753]  We're going to shoot people and ruin America's businesses.
[01:27:07.753 --> 01:27:10.718]  You know what Trump said?
[01:27:10.718 --> 01:27:12.180]  Watch you all get arrested and killed.
[01:27:13.735 --> 01:27:14.255]  Hit back.
[01:27:14.255 --> 01:27:15.837]  Oh, you hit us in Vegas?
[01:27:15.837 --> 01:27:17.138]  You just got hit again.
[01:27:17.138 --> 01:27:22.762]  And there's people that don't want you to know that information, but I can tell you right now, I'm not stupid.
[01:27:22.762 --> 01:27:28.347]  It's not like Zachary just magically did all this on the show by himself.
[01:27:28.347 --> 01:27:38.515]  This is a total civil war within the government, and people are telling you what's really going on so it can be stopped, and you know it's been authorized.
[01:27:38.515 --> 01:27:40.077]  Because mama didn't raise a fool.
[01:27:40.077 --> 01:27:41.198]  I see the whole thing, don't you?
[01:27:42.898 --> 01:27:44.359]  So, that's where we are.
[01:27:44.359 --> 01:27:46.280]  Breakaway terror groups.
[01:27:46.280 --> 01:27:52.183]  Breakaway deep state, leftist CIA, Ford Foundation, Carnegie Foundation, Soros-type back groups.
[01:27:52.183 --> 01:27:55.084]  Same ones over through Ukraine with violent uprisings.
[01:27:55.084 --> 01:27:57.045]  They can't get leftists to go out and do anything.
[01:27:57.045 --> 01:27:59.386]  They're too busy wearing pampers.
[01:27:59.386 --> 01:28:01.287]  They're too busy sucking pacifiers.
[01:28:01.287 --> 01:28:02.408]  They're too busy whining.
[01:28:02.408 --> 01:28:04.409]  And so they've got their Islamic wind-ups.
[01:28:04.409 --> 01:28:09.111]  And I want those Islamic wind-ups to know most of them are scrambled brains like Mr. Kelly.
[01:28:10.603 --> 01:28:15.625]  You need to know, stupid, that you're being set up.
[01:28:15.625 --> 01:28:17.545]  You need to know you need to just stop.
[01:28:17.545 --> 01:28:18.665]  You need to just disappear.
[01:28:18.665 --> 01:28:21.466]  You need to just go away!
[01:28:21.466 --> 01:28:26.888]  Because dead men tell no tales and you're going to be in a black site getting tortured until you don't even know which end is up.
[01:28:28.092 --> 01:28:30.853]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, I'm Alex Jones, your host.
[01:28:30.853 --> 01:28:36.756]  This is the most hardcore transmission there is because the truth is the only thing that's going to set us free.
[01:28:36.756 --> 01:28:40.297]  Truth conquers all, and we're going to conquer the globalists.
[01:28:40.297 --> 01:28:42.098]  We're going to win this civil war.
[01:28:42.098 --> 01:28:43.959]  We're going to win the info war.
[01:28:43.959 --> 01:28:47.260]  Powerful information from election night on the other side straight ahead.
[01:28:47.720 --> 01:28:48.400]  I'm Alex Jones.
[01:28:48.400 --> 01:28:49.101]  Please stay with us.
[01:28:49.101 --> 01:28:50.621]  We are on the march.
[01:28:50.621 --> 01:28:53.563]  The empire is on the run.

[01:28:59.445 --> 01:29:07.309]  You need a water filter that removes chlorine, fluoride, pharmaceuticals, BPA and other endocrine disruptors, pesticides, bacteria, viruses and much more, right?
[01:29:07.469 --> 01:29:07.729]  I think so.

[01:30:57.597 --> 01:31:00.719]  America is an information-based civil war.
[01:31:00.719 --> 01:31:08.163]  That's why now more than ever, we've got to hit the streets of America and let these globalist scum know we're not backing down from their bullying.
[01:31:08.163 --> 01:31:13.746]  We're only intensifying our operations in the face of their wannabe dictatorship.
[01:31:14.526 --> 01:31:22.189]  Being a conservative, a nationalist, a libertarian, or simply a free speech advocate is truly the counterculture.
[01:31:22.189 --> 01:31:30.072]  The real punk rock is being a patriot who's pro-America, pro-capitalism, and pro-freedom, who at the same time is tolerant.
[01:31:30.792 --> 01:31:35.857]  Modern liberalism is a counterfeit of Thomas Jefferson's classical liberalism.
[01:31:35.857 --> 01:31:37.979]  They are the anti-liberals.
[01:31:37.979 --> 01:31:51.370]  To defend free speech, meet like-minded friends, and promote freedom worldwide, we've got more than 60 original designs of high-quality t-shirts for men and women, as well as more Patriot apparel at InfoWarsTore.com.

[01:32:59.833 --> 01:33:02.475]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:33:15.602 --> 01:33:17.163]  365 days later.
[01:33:17.163 --> 01:33:19.525]  The shockwaves.
[01:33:19.525 --> 01:33:24.770]  The flashbacks from the front lines of the Information War.
[01:33:24.770 --> 01:33:26.331]  It's Alex Jones.
[01:33:36.785 --> 01:33:38.905]  The video we're about to air was from 3 a.m.
[01:33:38.905 --> 01:33:39.426]  in the morning.
[01:33:39.426 --> 01:33:40.586]  I was totally exhausted.
[01:33:40.586 --> 01:33:46.727]  I had a couple glasses of champagne, but it wasn't alcohol.
[01:33:46.727 --> 01:33:47.907]  I was just totally shot.
[01:33:47.907 --> 01:33:52.368]  I've been on air like 15, 16 hours.
[01:33:52.368 --> 01:33:54.508]  I had to do one final transmission that night.
[01:33:54.508 --> 01:33:57.569]  We're gonna air some excerpts of it here in just a moment.
[01:33:57.569 --> 01:34:04.330]  Then start the next hour and open the phones up and play compilation clips of them all panicking and freaking out.
[01:34:04.330 --> 01:34:04.510]  But...
[01:34:06.095 --> 01:34:15.020]  Back to the impending terror attack according to our source and the civil war going on in Islam.
[01:34:15.020 --> 01:34:21.224]  It all comes together and you can see why they wanted to shut that source up because they're afraid of what else he might say.
[01:34:21.224 --> 01:34:22.405]  But he didn't say anything secret.
[01:34:24.312 --> 01:34:30.978]  But hopefully once he gets out or his lawyer approves it, we'll have Zach via Skype or in studio with us.
[01:34:30.978 --> 01:34:33.420]  But they're threatening to take his job away and his security clearance.
[01:34:33.420 --> 01:34:35.101]  But you know what?
[01:34:35.101 --> 01:34:39.605]  People have a right and they have a duty to stand up against the globalists.
[01:34:43.237 --> 01:34:45.437]  The Deep State clearly has been behind Islam.
[01:34:45.437 --> 01:34:46.538]  They've been behind radical Islam.
[01:34:46.538 --> 01:34:49.698]  They've been behind the destabilization in the Middle East, the Arab Spring.
[01:34:49.698 --> 01:34:52.539]  John McCain funded and helped create ISIS with Hillary and Obama.
[01:34:52.539 --> 01:34:56.259]  And so, of course, they would be suspects in launch attacks inside this country.
[01:34:56.259 --> 01:34:57.600]  And yes, I'm saying it.
[01:34:57.600 --> 01:34:59.660]  The people that control them.
[01:34:59.660 --> 01:35:04.441]  Now, before I go any further, we're running the biggest specials.
[01:35:04.441 --> 01:35:08.822]  We run them like six months and free shipping store-wide at InfoWarsStore.com.
[01:35:11.943 --> 01:35:16.366]  And when we sell products at this lower price, we've got to sell a lot of it to fund the operation.
[01:35:16.366 --> 01:35:22.409]  But I know the products are so good that even though we make a very small profit on each item, you'll like them and then order more.
[01:35:22.409 --> 01:35:32.936]  Especially things like the coffee that's so good, or our toothpaste, or our mouthwash, or our vitamin-mineral fusion, fruit punch drink that's got all the amino acids and multivitamins.
[01:35:34.611 --> 01:35:36.573]  Our probiotic, all of it.
[01:35:36.573 --> 01:35:40.317]  Super Mill Vitality, 50% off, never done that, and free shipping.
[01:35:40.317 --> 01:35:41.078]  Boom.
[01:35:41.078 --> 01:35:43.780]  Super Fill Mill Vitality, 50% off, with free shipping.
[01:35:43.780 --> 01:35:44.781]  Boom.
[01:35:44.781 --> 01:35:48.225]  Biome Defense, 50% off, with free shipping.
[01:35:48.225 --> 01:35:50.687]  With the free shipping, folks, it's a loss leader.
[01:35:50.687 --> 01:35:55.272]  You sign up for AutoShip, we're losing like six, seven dollars on this.
[01:35:56.533 --> 01:35:58.234]  Biodefense, amazing probiotic.
[01:35:58.234 --> 01:36:00.955]  We just got it in, sold out for almost three and a half months.
[01:36:00.955 --> 01:36:03.837]  Doesn't matter, I just want you to see how great it is.
[01:36:03.837 --> 01:36:05.357]  50% off, free shipping.
[01:36:05.357 --> 01:36:07.999]  Vitamin Mineral Fusion, 50% off, free shipping.
[01:36:07.999 --> 01:36:11.260]  Secret 12, free shipping, 50% off.
[01:36:11.260 --> 01:36:20.325]  Super Blue Fluoride, free mouthwash with colloidal silver and iodine, incredibly powerful concentrate, 50% off and free shipping.
[01:36:20.325 --> 01:36:22.326]  It's a big bottle, so the shipping's a big...
[01:36:23.206 --> 01:36:24.188]  Cost in there.
[01:36:24.188 --> 01:36:26.133]  DNA Force, sold out for almost four months.
[01:36:26.133 --> 01:36:27.997]  25% off, out of the gates.
[01:36:27.997 --> 01:36:29.079]  Free shipping.
[01:36:29.079 --> 01:36:32.907]  These specials cannot last long because some of these items are about to sell out.
[01:36:35.427 --> 01:36:39.008]  And quite frankly, folks, again, some of these won't even have back until the new year.
[01:36:39.008 --> 01:36:46.732]  I just want to absolutely blow it all out and let you see how great Secret 12 works, see how great Vitamin Mineral Fusion is.
[01:36:46.732 --> 01:36:50.113]  And the T-shirts, these are just advertisement for the truth.
[01:36:50.113 --> 01:36:51.513]  So I'd love to put them out at cost.
[01:36:51.513 --> 01:36:54.355]  I mean, that's when we sell 100,000 T-shirts.
[01:36:54.355 --> 01:37:00.217]  We've sold 100,000 of the Joker variant shirts, three different shirts, 100,000 total.
[01:37:00.217 --> 01:37:02.898]  But I sold most of them at $5.
[01:37:02.898 --> 01:37:04.939]  You lose money at that after all that.
[01:37:06.089 --> 01:37:07.351]  Cost of everything.
[01:37:18.413 --> 01:37:21.315]  Limited edition shirt that's $13.
[01:37:21.315 --> 01:37:23.816]  I think we're discounting it on top of free shipping.
[01:37:23.816 --> 01:37:24.856]  It's just ridiculous.
[01:37:24.856 --> 01:37:33.461]  We've got the Antifa shirt that says anti-fascism and anti-communism with the Antifa style symbol, but it's the American flag and the Gadsden flag.
[01:37:33.461 --> 01:37:34.201]  Great way to trigger them.
[01:37:34.201 --> 01:37:36.522]  That's only sold in the month of November.
[01:37:36.522 --> 01:37:38.043]  It's now $9.98 and free shipping.
[01:37:41.892 --> 01:37:44.033]  And it's a high-quality shirt.
[01:37:44.033 --> 01:37:47.514]  So, InfowarStore.com or 888-253-3139.
[01:37:47.514 --> 01:37:52.855]  See, it was already, I guess, 40% off.
[01:37:52.855 --> 01:37:54.936]  Now it's 50% off.
[01:37:54.936 --> 01:37:55.876]  $9.98.
[01:37:55.876 --> 01:37:59.037]  And stickers come with it.
[01:37:59.037 --> 01:37:59.777]  And free shipping.
[01:37:59.777 --> 01:38:02.578]  I mean, we lose probably $5 on that.
[01:38:02.578 --> 01:38:03.799]  But I don't care.
[01:38:03.799 --> 01:38:05.679]  I just want to get it out there.
[01:38:05.679 --> 01:38:06.780]  I want to spread the word.
[01:38:06.780 --> 01:38:07.800]  I want to win the Infowar.
[01:38:09.434 --> 01:38:23.245]  So, InfoWarsStore.com, InfoWarsLive.com, or 888-253-3139, store-wide free shipping on everything but like the storable food, because that's so heavy, and a few other things that are drop ship.
[01:38:23.245 --> 01:38:32.973]  But free shipping, InfoWarsStore.com, or 888-253-3139, and sign up for auto-ship, get an additional 10% off.
[01:38:32.973 --> 01:38:36.816]  And then you know every month, or every six days, or nine days, you're canceling time with one click.
[01:38:38.541 --> 01:38:40.946]  It's not like those old encyclopedia things or whatever when you were a kid.
[01:38:40.946 --> 01:38:43.933]  You'd get, you know, the book club and then it was so hard to cancel or whatever.
[01:38:43.933 --> 01:38:46.859]  This is one click digital, 10% off.
[01:38:46.859 --> 01:38:48.262]  Sign up for 14 days, 30 days, 60 days, 90 days.
[01:38:50.526 --> 01:38:54.807]  Every six months, and it just gets delivered to your door an additional 10% off a win-win.
[01:38:54.807 --> 01:38:56.808]  Infowarsstore.com.
[01:38:56.808 --> 01:38:59.209]  Please commit to support the broadcast today.
[01:38:59.209 --> 01:39:00.289]  Please spread the link.
[01:39:00.289 --> 01:39:03.130]  If you're not listening to us on local radio stations, spread their local link.
[01:39:03.130 --> 01:39:06.691]  If you're not, spread the link to Infowars.com forward slash show.
[01:39:06.691 --> 01:39:10.333]  We are now four and a half hours into the worldwide broadcast.
[01:39:10.333 --> 01:39:14.074]  America Rebirth and Renaissance with so much coming up today.
[01:39:14.074 --> 01:39:14.314]  Okay.
[01:39:16.141 --> 01:39:16.901]  Let me get to this.
[01:39:16.901 --> 01:39:20.262]  I'll play part of it in this segment, part of it in the next segment.
[01:39:20.262 --> 01:39:26.663]  Then I'm going to get into some of the geopolitical news and financial news and election news and election fraud news, vindicating Trump further.
[01:39:26.663 --> 01:39:30.564]  And then the big news, scientists are implanting tiny human brains into rats.
[01:39:30.564 --> 01:39:31.725]  Told you that 20 years ago.
[01:39:31.725 --> 01:39:34.765]  In fact, they're not implanting brains.
[01:39:34.765 --> 01:39:35.625]  That's old technology.
[01:39:35.625 --> 01:39:42.487]  They are putting human genetics into where the rat brain has human genetics and human characteristics.
[01:39:43.643 --> 01:39:46.006]  You notice I'm always made fun of this because I'm 20 years ahead.
[01:39:46.006 --> 01:39:47.489]  And I'm not bragging.
[01:39:47.489 --> 01:39:50.553]  Anybody could be 20 years ahead if you read policy papers.
[01:39:50.553 --> 01:39:52.736]  They treat you like idiots, folks.
[01:39:52.736 --> 01:39:53.518]  Like mushrooms.
[01:39:53.518 --> 01:39:54.599]  They keep you in the dark.
[01:39:54.599 --> 01:39:57.363]  So here I am at 3 something in the morning, 365 days ago.
[01:39:59.226 --> 01:40:01.147]  It's almost three o'clock in the morning Central Time.
[01:40:30.510 --> 01:40:35.154]  And we now have President-elect Donald Trump.
[01:40:35.154 --> 01:40:50.506]  Donald Trump is no angel, and neither am I. But Donald Trump's will is that you be prosperous and that you be successful.
[01:40:50.506 --> 01:40:55.990]  Donald Trump is not satanic.
[01:40:55.990 --> 01:40:57.692]  He does not want to see you poor.
[01:40:59.520 --> 01:41:03.123]  He does not wish to ground you under his treads.
[01:41:03.123 --> 01:41:08.768]  And that's why Goldman Sachs and JP Morgan and all the big mega banks have set themselves up against him.
[01:41:08.768 --> 01:41:12.732]  Because they believe they own you.
[01:41:12.732 --> 01:41:19.398]  I knew a year and a half ago when I endorsed Donald Trump he was going to win.
[01:41:19.398 --> 01:41:21.540]  And I've talked to him about why I knew that.
[01:41:23.677 --> 01:41:39.824]  But people I know, and people I trust, that are patriots, that have defended this republic, confirmed to me, and I've seen it in Donald Trump's actions, that he wanted to restore this republic.
[01:41:39.824 --> 01:41:44.746]  But I want to be very clear to you, very clear.
[01:41:44.746 --> 01:41:47.687]  This isn't about credit, it's so that you know the danger.
[01:41:50.307 --> 01:41:55.231]  You've seen the stupid ads with the bunny rabbit that says Energizer inside.
[01:41:55.231 --> 01:42:02.998]  If you want to know what powers Donald Trump, individually it's a love of liberty and a love of standing up to corruption.
[01:42:02.998 --> 01:42:04.820]  He's not perfect, nobody is.
[01:42:04.820 --> 01:42:09.864]  But what powers the movement is Infowars.
[01:42:09.864 --> 01:42:14.468]  They want to establish a private corporate global government.
[01:42:14.468 --> 01:42:15.329]  Nigel Farage,
[01:42:17.711 --> 01:42:23.680]  The leader of UKIP would come on my show 15 years ago when he barely had a few members a part of it.
[01:42:23.680 --> 01:42:26.003]  Now he's 100 times bigger and more.
[01:42:26.003 --> 01:42:30.089]  And he would say, it's your listeners listening to you in the US when I go knock on doors.
[01:42:30.089 --> 01:42:31.771]  That's why we're getting the UK Independence Party.
[01:42:31.771 --> 01:42:32.833]  It's impulse wars.
[01:42:32.833 --> 01:42:33.133]  Thank you.
[01:42:33.974 --> 01:42:34.755]  He said that on the show.
[01:42:56.354 --> 01:43:03.821]  I am very proud to announce the introduction of the highest quality InfoWars Biome Defense Probiotic.
[01:43:03.821 --> 01:43:17.053]  We wanted to come out with the largest spectrum of high quality known probiotics that have been proven to improve overall digestion and health and detoxification in the body.

[01:43:55.780 --> 01:44:00.183]  You go to InfoWarsTore.com and get game-changing, amazing products.
[01:44:00.183 --> 01:44:03.946]  We've been sold out of DNA Force for almost four months.
[01:44:03.946 --> 01:44:06.708]  These ingredients are nutraceutical grade.
[01:44:06.708 --> 01:44:09.510]  You have the highest quality, the bio-PQQ, all of it.
[01:44:09.510 --> 01:44:09.730]  It's 25% off.
[01:44:10.971 --> 01:44:17.158]  The Trump got in this morning, and it's back, but it is a limited run because of all the testing and all the rest of it.
[01:44:17.158 --> 01:44:18.319]  It's the highest quality.

[01:44:20.321 --> 01:44:21.182]  It is amazing.
[01:44:21.182 --> 01:44:26.488]  We also have been sold out for three months on biome defense, super high quality probiotic.
[01:44:26.488 --> 01:44:27.830]  It's 25% off.
[01:44:27.830 --> 01:44:31.674]  Out of the gates, back in stock, but for a very limited time.
[01:44:31.974 --> 01:44:34.475]  So you get the highest quality, the very cleanest stuff out there.
[01:44:34.475 --> 01:44:35.916]  We're really, really proud of it.
[01:44:35.916 --> 01:44:37.797]  DNA Force and Bomb Defense.
[01:44:37.797 --> 01:44:38.337]  Probiotic.
[01:44:38.337 --> 01:44:39.197]  Now back in stock.
[01:44:39.197 --> 01:44:40.338]  Infowarslife.com.
[01:44:40.338 --> 01:44:44.179]  And when you buy products from Globalist, it's an act of trading with the enemy.
[01:44:44.179 --> 01:44:45.320]  It is an act of war.
[01:44:45.320 --> 01:44:47.361]  It is an act of standing up.
[01:44:47.361 --> 01:44:52.923]  When you spread the links, the articles, and buy products from us, and then we commit to rampage against the enemy totally.
[01:44:56.280 --> 01:45:00.044]  My fellow freedom lovers, Alex Jones here with a very important message.
[01:45:00.044 --> 01:45:05.410]  Secret 12, 40% off the best vitamin B12 out there from our research.
[01:45:05.410 --> 01:45:06.471]  Can't get it under the tongue.
[01:45:06.471 --> 01:45:07.433]  Simply amazing.
[01:45:07.433 --> 01:45:09.094]  That sale is continuing.
[01:45:09.094 --> 01:45:12.418]  Super Mel Vitality for stamina, libido, energy.
[01:45:12.418 --> 01:45:13.459]  That's 30% off.
[01:45:13.459 --> 01:45:14.581]  That's continuing.
[01:45:14.581 --> 01:45:15.762]  And the other really, really
[01:45:15.922 --> 01:45:26.715]  Good news is that yes, we're having to end the sale of 50% off on Anthroplex, but DNA Force, after almost four months, out of stock is back in stock.
[01:45:26.715 --> 01:45:28.317]  25% off our flagship product.
[01:45:28.317 --> 01:45:33.162]  Also, Biome Defense, the great probiotic, that is 25% off as well.
[01:45:33.162 --> 01:45:34.504]  So a lot of things are selling out.
[01:45:34.704 --> 01:45:37.527]  But a lot of things are still at record sales.
[01:45:37.527 --> 01:45:41.831]  Like Silver Bullet, super high quality colloidal silver is still 50% off.
[01:45:41.831 --> 01:45:45.935]  And there's other sales that are still going, but they're all about to end.
[01:45:45.935 --> 01:45:52.422]  Whether it's DNA Force, or whether it's Silver Bullet, it's all available right now at InfoWarsLife.com or by calling toll-free, 888-253-3139.

[01:46:59.759 --> 01:47:02.442]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:47:10.032 --> 01:47:11.877]  We are on the march.
[01:47:11.877 --> 01:47:15.044]  The Empire is on the run.
[01:47:15.044 --> 01:47:18.732]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:47:26.204 --> 01:47:30.186]  Alright folks, get ready for this coming up in the next hour.
[01:47:30.186 --> 01:47:34.369]  Facebook wants your nudes to combat revenge porn.
[01:47:34.369 --> 01:47:40.793]  The government wants to basically start the program and then force you in Australia to take nude photos of yourself and put it online.
[01:47:41.753 --> 01:47:46.534]  So that they can have bots go out and stop revenge porn if anybody ever did anything bad to you.
[01:47:46.534 --> 01:47:48.234]  Talk about pre-crime.
[01:47:48.234 --> 01:47:49.194]  Talk about A.I.
[01:47:49.194 --> 01:47:51.635]  controlling everything so it can, quote, protect you.
[01:47:51.635 --> 01:47:52.535]  Talk about nightmare.
[01:47:52.535 --> 01:47:53.575]  That's coming up.
[01:47:53.575 --> 01:48:01.476]  That's a Raquel Phelan article at InfoWars.com, directly linking to the Australian Broadcasting Corporation.
[01:48:01.476 --> 01:48:04.597]  Scientists are implanting tiny human brains into rats.
[01:48:04.597 --> 01:48:05.357]  That's the sun.
[01:48:05.357 --> 01:48:06.497]  We'll get into that.
[01:48:06.497 --> 01:48:10.398]  EPA approves bacteria-infected insects to kill mosquitoes.
[01:48:12.608 --> 01:48:14.029]  That's just some of the news.
[01:48:14.029 --> 01:48:15.069]  Self-driving cars.
[01:48:15.069 --> 01:48:19.971]  We are not in Kansas anymore.
[01:48:19.971 --> 01:48:23.513]  But first, let's go back to that 3 a.m.
[01:48:23.513 --> 01:48:32.856]  transmission where I laid out the fact that already InfoWars had done its mission and been successful and really turned the tide, thanks to you.
[01:48:32.856 --> 01:48:36.978]  And then I believe Trump would then deliver, which we're now seeing unfold.
[01:48:36.978 --> 01:48:38.319]  But the fight is just beginning.
[01:48:38.319 --> 01:48:38.619]  Here it is.
[01:48:40.782 --> 01:48:46.745]  The leader of UKIP would come on my show 15 years ago when he barely had a few members of parliament.
[01:48:46.745 --> 01:48:49.066]  Now he's 100 times bigger and more.
[01:48:49.066 --> 01:48:53.128]  And he would say, it's your listeners listening to you in the US when I go knock on doors.
[01:48:53.128 --> 01:48:55.009]  That's why we're getting the UK Independence Party.
[01:48:55.009 --> 01:48:55.869]  It's info wars.
[01:48:55.869 --> 01:48:57.050]  Thank you.
[01:48:57.050 --> 01:48:58.330]  He said that on the show.
[01:48:58.330 --> 01:48:59.311]  He thought about us bragging.
[01:48:59.311 --> 01:49:08.395]  He said the spirit of the info war across the world from Australia to the UK and Russia, from Nigeria to Mexico is spreading.
[01:49:11.059 --> 01:49:14.781]  And it's the Renaissance idea of freedom.
[01:49:14.781 --> 01:49:17.803]  And that's why they're trying to shut us down.
[01:49:17.803 --> 01:49:21.225]  Because we're not perfect, but we're not out to get people.
[01:49:21.225 --> 01:49:22.966]  We believe in lower taxes.
[01:49:22.966 --> 01:49:25.928]  We know empowering the people is the answer.
[01:49:25.928 --> 01:49:28.389]  We don't want to break up families.
[01:49:28.389 --> 01:49:32.491]  We're not out to get people.
[01:49:32.491 --> 01:49:36.354]  And Donald Trump is not out to get you.
[01:49:36.354 --> 01:49:36.674]  That's all.
[01:49:37.984 --> 01:49:45.590]  He's not some weird **** that wants you to abort your kid, or take a dangerous vaccine, or submit to their system.
[01:49:45.590 --> 01:49:49.533]  Now that said, it's 3 o'clock in the morning, I'm going to shut this down, I'm exhausted.
[01:49:49.533 --> 01:49:55.118]  But this historic occasion has happened, I should warn you.
[01:49:55.118 --> 01:49:57.900]  Donald Trump is more a figurehead of liberty than ever before.
[01:50:00.854 --> 01:50:04.857]  And he has the Holy Ghost protecting him.
[01:50:04.857 --> 01:50:12.064]  And no weapon formed against him will prosper as long as we pray for him.
[01:50:12.064 --> 01:50:14.506]  We're here.
[01:50:14.506 --> 01:50:18.209]  And the evil of the globalists is ongoing.
[01:50:18.209 --> 01:50:20.271]  And Donald Trump isn't some panacea.
[01:50:20.271 --> 01:50:22.973]  He's only a manifestation of our awakening.
[01:50:22.973 --> 01:50:25.315]  So listen to me, and I'm going to close this out.
[01:50:28.257 --> 01:50:31.418]  They are going to try to collapse the world economy.
[01:50:31.418 --> 01:50:33.359]  They've already been prompting it up for a while.
[01:50:33.359 --> 01:50:35.700]  They're going to blame it on Donald Trump.
[01:50:35.700 --> 01:50:37.140]  A global depression.
[01:50:37.140 --> 01:50:39.201]  They knew they couldn't stop the movement.
[01:50:39.201 --> 01:50:43.302]  So now that he's in, they're going to implode the economy and blame him.
[01:50:43.302 --> 01:50:45.743]  Well, they're the ones who created the derivatives.
[01:50:45.743 --> 01:50:48.304]  Well, they're the ones who created the end of Glass-Steagall.
[01:50:48.304 --> 01:50:51.985]  When Hillary Clinton and Larry Summers did it all, they're going to blame Donald Trump.
[01:50:55.143 --> 01:50:56.004]  How do I know that?
[01:50:56.004 --> 01:50:56.905]  They threatened the UK.
[01:50:56.905 --> 01:51:00.047]  They said, you try to leave this unelected thing, we'll implode your economy.
[01:51:00.047 --> 01:51:01.008]  We'll take your jobs away.
[01:51:01.008 --> 01:51:03.030]  Just like they did in Iceland or Greece.
[01:51:03.030 --> 01:51:04.992]  Some countries fold, some fight back.
[01:51:04.992 --> 01:51:06.273]  We know their plan.
[01:51:06.273 --> 01:51:09.595]  If you're just conscious and want to know the truth, it's all there.
[01:51:09.595 --> 01:51:12.278]  It's not my opinion.
[01:51:12.278 --> 01:51:13.479]  I want self-determination.
[01:51:13.479 --> 01:51:17.182]  I won't be held hostage.
[01:51:17.182 --> 01:51:20.525]  So, this isn't like buying a lottery ticket.
[01:51:22.025 --> 01:51:28.767]  Where you elect Donald Trump and beat the establishment and then expect the whole gravy trade to continue on.
[01:51:28.767 --> 01:51:31.528]  Who wants this fake gravy trade?
[01:51:31.528 --> 01:51:34.588]  We need to get back to what makes us human, what makes us real.
[01:51:34.588 --> 01:51:37.509]  And if we're getting ahead of the expense of some third world people, we shouldn't do it.
[01:51:37.509 --> 01:51:43.691]  If we're getting ahead of the expense of our kids, we shouldn't do it.
[01:51:43.691 --> 01:51:47.352]  Donald Trump, for all his gold-plated planes and everything he does,
[01:51:48.584 --> 01:51:52.566]  His sin is that he isn't out to get you.
[01:51:52.566 --> 01:51:56.448]  I saw the enemy truly against Donald Trump.
[01:51:56.448 --> 01:51:57.669]  Spiritually hating him.
[01:51:57.669 --> 01:52:01.070]  So I backed him.
[01:52:01.070 --> 01:52:02.051]  And I've interviewed him on air.
[01:52:02.051 --> 01:52:02.991]  I've talked to Donald Trump.
[01:52:02.991 --> 01:52:05.593]  But I've talked to other people.
[01:52:05.593 --> 01:52:07.794]  I've talked to other presidents.
[01:52:07.794 --> 01:52:10.415]  Governor Bush tried to get me to work with him.
[01:52:10.415 --> 01:52:14.417]  I didn't do it because he wasn't a good man.
[01:52:14.417 --> 01:52:16.298]  Trump, my spirit tells me,
[01:52:19.184 --> 01:52:21.865]  Need to be supported.
[01:52:21.865 --> 01:52:25.687]  And he can falter, he can waver.
[01:52:25.687 --> 01:52:30.650]  But all of us are prodigal sons.
[01:52:30.650 --> 01:52:34.111]  And I can tell you, if you want freedom, it's not free.
[01:52:34.111 --> 01:52:36.072]  The storm is coming now.
[01:52:36.072 --> 01:52:45.357]  This victory is part of the destiny of the Republic.
[01:52:45.357 --> 01:52:46.097]  This country
[01:52:48.723 --> 01:53:02.351]  Is the vision of incredibly pure people who wanted to build up society and create a launch pad for the technology we now enjoy.
[01:53:02.351 --> 01:53:10.136]  And they believed we would be pure and appreciate this technology in their incredible crystal visions.
[01:53:10.136 --> 01:53:14.138]  And not a bunch of lazy ****.
[01:53:14.138 --> 01:53:16.580]  So let's make those pilgrims right.
[01:53:18.422 --> 01:53:23.786]  And let's build what they envisioned, because we're their children.
[01:53:23.786 --> 01:53:30.951]  And let's never look down on people that aren't as smart as us, and are weak, and say, use them as animals, they're dumb.
[01:53:30.951 --> 01:53:39.378]  Because the minute we stoop down to do that, we become cannibals, and we lose our humanity.
[01:53:39.378 --> 01:53:42.940]  It's not some New Age term, because they use this term, but it's God.
[01:53:42.940 --> 01:53:44.922]  It's Christ energy.
[01:53:46.915 --> 01:53:50.777]  is dumping into this planet right now.
[01:53:50.777 --> 01:54:01.781]  We're being bathed in the ambionic fluid of the birth of something magic.
[01:54:01.781 --> 01:54:13.986]  But all of us, individually, have to collectively decide, we want to give birth to what God talked about in the Bible, that the eye has not seen, the ear has not heard,
[01:54:18.206 --> 01:54:21.069]  We have to decide we care.
[01:54:21.069 --> 01:54:23.491]  And we can do anything.
[01:54:23.491 --> 01:54:26.374]  Anything we want.
[01:54:26.374 --> 01:54:29.857]  But we can't hurt the innocent.
[01:54:29.857 --> 01:54:30.438]  All right.
[01:54:30.438 --> 01:54:31.118]  I'm done talking.
[01:54:31.118 --> 01:54:31.759]  I'm exhausted.
[01:54:31.759 --> 01:54:33.280]  It's 2.43.
[01:54:33.280 --> 01:54:35.843]  I want to thank you, Josh.
[01:54:35.843 --> 01:54:41.588]  I want to thank this whole crew, the viewers and listeners.
[01:54:41.588 --> 01:54:43.230]  And I may not have all the answers.
[01:54:46.894 --> 01:54:55.761]  But thank God I'm not one of these people like Lady Gaga and John Podesta and all the stuff they're doing.
[01:54:55.761 --> 01:54:59.163]  Can you imagine being so fallen that you think corrupting children gives you power?
[01:54:59.163 --> 01:55:03.667]  So you're like burning your own hardware up, your own circuitry.
[01:55:03.667 --> 01:55:05.648]  You're like, oh, I'm dying spiritually.
[01:55:05.648 --> 01:55:06.409]  Oh, I've got power.
[01:55:12.022 --> 01:55:19.087]  But it's our weakness and subservience to them that let them think they were God.
[01:55:19.087 --> 01:55:30.194]  And I realize it's those of us that have the spark of creativity and intellect that give in to these people that are their enablers.
[01:55:30.194 --> 01:55:36.778]  And the fact that we won't take control and rule and build is our fault.
[01:55:36.778 --> 01:55:39.560]  We are the real people that did all this.
[01:55:41.280 --> 01:55:47.543]  By creating a vacuum and putting these demons in control, we ceded control.
[01:55:47.543 --> 01:55:49.524]  We committed the crimes.
[01:55:49.524 --> 01:55:51.645]  I committed the crimes.
[01:55:51.645 --> 01:55:56.087]  And I will no longer commit those crimes.
[01:55:56.087 --> 01:56:02.430]  It's time to take charge of this third dimension and beyond.
[01:56:02.430 --> 01:56:06.992]  Donald Trump is only a childlike, as we all are, manifestation of this.
[01:56:09.591 --> 01:56:14.153]  We have the keys to the universe because God gave them to us.
[01:56:14.153 --> 01:56:16.295]  God, who has dreams for us.
[01:56:16.295 --> 01:56:17.996]  God, who loves us.
[01:56:17.996 --> 01:56:21.077]  God, who gave us knowledge of good and evil.
[01:56:21.077 --> 01:56:29.502]  But we must thank God, and then take those keys in our hands, and have the will to open those doors.
[01:56:29.502 --> 01:56:36.906]  The big challenge now comes, because the promise to this country, in Providence, was if you'll hit your knees,
[01:56:38.283 --> 01:56:41.644]  You'll ask God, you'll get it.
[01:56:41.644 --> 01:56:48.787]  But if we now don't deliver, you don't ask God for providence and then not deliver.
[01:56:48.787 --> 01:56:50.268]  Now we are bound forever.
[01:56:50.268 --> 01:57:00.351]  And if we don't deliver this plan and free humanity, we will be bound to the ninth circle of hell.
[01:57:00.351 --> 01:57:04.373]  I'm bound to this truth and I will never stop delivering.
[01:57:06.127 --> 01:57:12.109]  It's time for you to transcend Hollywood and all these other weak people and submit yourself to God.
[01:57:12.109 --> 01:57:14.430]  You won't find God in these schools.
[01:57:14.430 --> 01:57:16.631]  You won't find God in these churches.
[01:57:16.631 --> 01:57:18.592]  They're all there to deflect.
[01:57:18.592 --> 01:57:22.854]  You're gonna find God in your heart.
[01:57:22.854 --> 01:57:24.214]  I've said it.
[01:57:24.214 --> 01:57:25.154]  I've already run my course.
[01:57:25.154 --> 01:57:29.116]  I already know my entire life purpose has been completed.
[01:57:29.116 --> 01:57:30.497]  I will continue on.
[01:57:30.497 --> 01:57:33.898]  But now, I realize I've won.
[01:57:36.477 --> 01:57:38.920]  And now, a year later, Trump is only delivering.
[01:57:38.920 --> 01:57:42.964]  Yes, we're living in epic times.
[01:57:42.964 --> 01:57:43.545]  This is real.

[02:00:06.522 --> 02:00:11.763]  Defending the Republic from enemies, foreign and domestic.
[02:00:11.763 --> 02:00:13.403]  It's Alex Jones.
[02:00:13.403 --> 02:00:19.284]  Now we've got a bunch of clips of mainstream media whores crying and begging and freaking out coming up.
[02:00:19.284 --> 02:00:22.965]  A bunch of science and technology news as well.
[02:00:22.965 --> 02:00:25.185]  Human brains being implanted into rats.
[02:00:25.185 --> 02:00:29.726]  That's how they treat the Democratic Party constituent.
[02:00:29.726 --> 02:00:30.466]  It's all coming up.
[02:00:30.466 --> 02:00:32.107]  I already aired this but it's too important.
[02:00:32.107 --> 02:00:32.747]  I'm going to air it again.
[02:00:32.747 --> 02:00:34.267]  I aired it at the very start of the broadcast today.
[02:00:35.549 --> 02:00:36.909]  Or my leg of it.
[02:00:36.909 --> 02:00:40.811]  We're going to be live for the next 30 hours, still, with a special transmission.
[02:00:40.811 --> 02:00:47.153]  But here are the Democrats telling you, and their operatives, and the fake comedians, and the fake news, that Trump would never be president.
[02:00:47.153 --> 02:00:55.295]  But you bucked their mind control, and now they don't know what to do because they're all about running your life, running your mind, and telling you what to think.
[02:00:55.295 --> 02:00:59.497]  But sorry, you broke the conditioning.
[02:00:59.497 --> 02:01:01.857]  There's not going to be a President Donald Trump.
[02:01:01.857 --> 02:01:03.698]  That's not going to happen.
[02:01:05.489 --> 02:01:08.035]  Donald Trump will not become president!
[02:01:12.506 --> 02:01:13.967]  He's not going to be president.
[02:01:13.967 --> 02:01:18.210]  He is not, Donald Trump, is not going to be president of the United States.
[02:01:18.210 --> 02:01:19.111]  Take it to the bank.
[02:01:19.111 --> 02:01:20.051]  I guarantee it.
[02:01:20.051 --> 02:01:20.792]  Alright, alright.
[02:01:20.792 --> 02:01:24.695]  I think if he becomes the president, he'll make it great because the states is already great.
[02:01:24.695 --> 02:01:32.781]  I think that man will be president of the United States right about the time that spaceships come down filled with dinosaurs and red capes.
[02:01:32.781 --> 02:01:35.282]  On that note, Tom, take it from me.
[02:01:35.282 --> 02:01:36.884]  How about that?
[02:01:36.884 --> 02:01:38.164]  And then, of course, there's Donald Trump.
[02:01:39.185 --> 02:01:45.132]  Donald Trump has been saying that he will run for president as a Republican, which is surprising since I just assumed he was running as a joke.
[02:01:53.086 --> 02:01:57.850]  Donald Trump, just last week he confirmed to the National Review that he is again considering a run in 2016.
[02:01:57.850 --> 02:01:59.151]  Do it.
[02:01:59.151 --> 02:02:01.193]  Do it.
[02:02:01.193 --> 02:02:03.595]  Look at me.
[02:02:03.595 --> 02:02:04.676]  Do it.
[02:02:04.676 --> 02:02:14.364]  I will personally write you a campaign check now on behalf of this country, which does not want you to be president, but which badly wants you to run.
[02:02:15.160 --> 02:02:26.174]  So when you stand and deliver that State of the Union address, in no part of your mind or brain can you imagine Donald Trump standing up one day and delivering a State of the Union address?
[02:02:26.174 --> 02:02:30.779]  Well, I can imagine it in a Saturday night skit.
[02:02:31.440 --> 02:02:33.902]  I continue to believe Mr. Trump will not be president.
[02:02:33.902 --> 02:02:37.145]  He will never be president of the United States.
[02:02:37.145 --> 02:02:40.769]  And we better be ready for the fact that he might be leaving the Republican ticket.
[02:02:40.769 --> 02:02:41.769]  Next.
[02:02:41.769 --> 02:02:43.971]  I know you don't believe that, but I want to go on.
[02:02:43.971 --> 02:02:45.993]  Sorry to have you.
[02:02:45.993 --> 02:02:47.855]  Okay, here we are.
[02:02:47.855 --> 02:02:52.779]  And which Republican candidate has the best chance of winning the general election?
[02:02:52.779 --> 02:02:55.362]  Of the declared ones, right now, Donald Trump.
[02:03:03.456 --> 02:03:12.544]  And so, right now, Mr. Trump, to answer your call for political honesty, I just want to say, you're not going to be president, alright?
[02:03:12.544 --> 02:03:15.226]  It's been fun.
[02:03:15.226 --> 02:03:18.649]  It's been great.
[02:03:18.649 --> 02:03:20.090]  I love you.
[02:03:20.090 --> 02:03:22.552]  But, come on, come on, buddy.
[02:03:22.552 --> 02:03:31.400]  All, let's say, cow poo-poo aside, there is zero chance we'll be seeing you being sworn in on the Capitol steps with your hand on a giant golden Bible.
[02:03:32.748 --> 02:03:34.750]  I'll make a prediction, though, for you.
[02:03:34.750 --> 02:03:38.893]  I don't really get into predictions much, but this one I'll go way out on a limb.
[02:03:38.893 --> 02:03:44.938]  Donald Trump will never, ever be President of the United States.
[02:03:44.938 --> 02:03:47.300]  Trump should not be in this race.
[02:03:47.300 --> 02:03:48.601]  He's an absurdity.
[02:03:48.601 --> 02:03:50.823]  He is a travesty.
[02:03:50.823 --> 02:03:54.626]  Donald Trump will never be elected President of the United States.
[02:03:54.626 --> 02:03:59.591]  Donald Trump is a here-today-gone-tomorrow candidate for President of the United States.
[02:04:00.939 --> 02:04:05.001]  Donald Trump is not going to be President of the United States.
[02:04:05.001 --> 02:04:12.463]  Ever respectful of the fact that the people have not voted, he's not going to be President of the United States.
[02:04:12.463 --> 02:04:13.504]  Let's be clear.
[02:04:13.504 --> 02:04:16.505]  Donald Trump will lose the election.
[02:04:16.505 --> 02:04:21.887]  He had a really good chance to be different and really have a chance to change things, but he doesn't do the work.
[02:04:21.887 --> 02:04:22.427]  He's lazy.
[02:04:23.152 --> 02:04:25.813]  We talk about him every day and we continuously bash him.
[02:04:25.813 --> 02:04:27.734]  He's not going to be the president, don't worry about it.
[02:04:27.734 --> 02:04:28.634]  Exactly!
[02:04:28.634 --> 02:04:31.435]  This is going to be a wake-up call to the Republican Party.
[02:04:31.435 --> 02:04:37.717]  Despite Boris thinking that Donald Trump could win New York, the presidential race is over.
[02:04:37.717 --> 02:04:38.558]  Could I just cut through?
[02:04:38.558 --> 02:04:41.039]  I have one thing to say, one thing only.
[02:04:41.039 --> 02:04:43.760]  And that is that this race is over.
[02:04:44.620 --> 02:04:47.442]  Tomorrow morning, the money will dry up.
[02:04:47.442 --> 02:04:49.583]  The Republicans will start to hide.
[02:04:49.583 --> 02:04:50.944]  Trump has no place to go.
[02:04:50.944 --> 02:04:56.126]  This race, effectively, as of tonight, is no longer a presidential race.
[02:04:56.126 --> 02:04:59.848]  Go to infowarestore.com and get game-changing, amazing products.
[02:04:59.848 --> 02:05:03.611]  We've been sold out of DNA Force for almost four months.

[02:05:35.579 --> 02:05:37.460]  DNA Force and Bomb Defense.
[02:05:37.460 --> 02:05:37.980]  Probiotic.
[02:05:37.980 --> 02:05:38.861]  Now back in stock.
[02:05:38.861 --> 02:05:40.322]  Infowarslife.com.
[02:05:40.322 --> 02:05:43.843]  When you buy products from Globalist, it's an act of trading with the enemy.
[02:05:43.843 --> 02:05:44.984]  It is an act of war.
[02:05:44.984 --> 02:05:47.025]  It is an act of standing up.
[02:05:47.025 --> 02:05:52.588]  When you spread the links, the articles, and buy products from us, and then we commit to rampage against the enemy totally.
[02:06:01.684 --> 02:06:02.505]  It's not true!
[02:06:02.505 --> 02:06:03.567]  That's impossible!
[02:06:38.571 --> 02:06:45.941]  It's also what happens when you listen to the radio host Alex Jones.
[02:06:45.941 --> 02:06:46.983]  Move, bitch!
[02:06:46.983 --> 02:06:48.165]  Get out of the way!
[02:06:56.911 --> 02:07:15.258]  This means that Donald Trump will be the 45th President of the United States.
[02:07:15.258 --> 02:07:19.360]  Waging war on corruption.
[02:07:19.360 --> 02:07:21.661]  It's Alex Jones!
[02:07:23.899 --> 02:07:26.441]  Here we are, 365 days later.
[02:07:26.441 --> 02:07:32.584]  They thought by branding Trump with Infowars it would hurt him, but all the studies now show it helped him.
[02:07:32.584 --> 02:07:34.585]  And all their fake polls blew up in their face.
[02:07:34.585 --> 02:07:37.507]  Now the establishment's even more discredited.
[02:07:37.507 --> 02:07:40.548]  They've lost eight special elections when Patriots ran.
[02:07:40.548 --> 02:07:45.371]  The Democrats have just won two elections where they won last election, so it's not really a surprise.
[02:07:45.931 --> 02:07:48.773]  But because they ran establishment Republicans.
[02:07:48.773 --> 02:07:52.956]  Now Dr. Edward Group, good friend of mine, is here with us today.
[02:07:52.956 --> 02:07:57.779]  I wanted to get him here in the studio with us to talk about science news, technology news.
[02:07:57.779 --> 02:08:01.462]  You know, about a month ago this came out, CNN.
[02:08:01.462 --> 02:08:07.846]  Fluoride exposure in utero, that's in your mama's uterus, linked to lower IQs in kids study finds.
[02:08:07.846 --> 02:08:11.028]  And then of course there's other big Harvard studies about 15 point IQ reductions.
[02:08:11.028 --> 02:08:12.850]  Just a few years bringing one point
[02:08:13.629 --> 02:08:14.594]  1.3 parts per million.
[02:08:17.076 --> 02:08:18.877]  Causing massive brain damage.
[02:08:18.877 --> 02:08:21.978]  And of course the government mandates even higher than that.
[02:08:21.978 --> 02:08:22.338]  Here it is.
[02:08:22.338 --> 02:08:25.559]  Fluoride exposure in utero linked to lower IQ in kids.
[02:08:25.559 --> 02:08:28.680]  Now Facebook wants your nudes to combat revenge porn.
[02:08:28.680 --> 02:08:29.740]  I'm not joking.
[02:08:29.740 --> 02:08:31.601]  And then another report here.
[02:08:31.601 --> 02:08:34.582]  Scientists are implanting tiny human brains into rats.
[02:08:34.582 --> 02:08:35.302]  We're going to get into that.
[02:08:35.302 --> 02:08:35.842]  I've been mentioning it.
[02:08:35.842 --> 02:08:36.822]  We're going to talk about it.
[02:08:36.822 --> 02:08:38.283]  We'll also talk about the election.
[02:08:38.283 --> 02:08:40.083]  Everything that's happened since then.
[02:08:40.083 --> 02:08:42.124]  Nationalists getting elected around the world.
[02:08:42.124 --> 02:08:43.264]  There's a lot of positive things.
[02:08:43.264 --> 02:08:44.185]  Also a lot of negative things.
[02:08:44.185 --> 02:08:44.745]  But first off,
[02:08:45.245 --> 02:08:45.425]  Yeah.
[02:09:04.017 --> 02:09:11.444]  But you told me that it was, I mean, you know, holy men and of course God, Jesus, you know, went out and would fast for 30 plus days or whatever.
[02:09:11.444 --> 02:09:16.128]  But you were talking about some of the mental things that happened, how it basically eats up all the dead stuff in your body.
[02:09:16.128 --> 02:09:19.691]  And so you kind of were a pioneer, because folks can die doing this.
[02:09:19.691 --> 02:09:23.375]  I think, you know, obviously people need to, you know, do some research before you do this.
[02:09:23.375 --> 02:09:26.597]  But you did it, filmed for the documentary.
[02:09:26.597 --> 02:09:27.819]  Tell us about your experiences.
[02:09:28.717 --> 02:09:41.307]  Well, for the last year and a half, I actually hired somebody to help me as a research assistant to try to determine what are the benefits of water-only fasting because it's a very trendy topic.
[02:09:41.307 --> 02:09:44.330]  You have a lot of people that are going into the ketogenic diet right now.
[02:09:44.330 --> 02:09:46.832]  You have a lot of people that are doing the intermittent fasting.
[02:09:47.492 --> 02:09:53.458]  But I'm hardcore like you, Alex, so I wanted to say, what are the benefits of water-only fasting?
[02:09:53.458 --> 02:10:03.929]  And that means no vitamin supplements at all, not even a grain of salt, not even a grain of pepper, and that means only water, distilled water, spring water, and hydrogen water is what I was on.
[02:10:04.449 --> 02:10:11.275]  For 18 days straight and I wanted to monitor myself, monitor my moods, monitor what was happening with my energy levels.
[02:10:11.275 --> 02:10:16.679]  There are a lot of myths about fasting but of course it's mentioned 38 times in the Bible.
[02:10:16.679 --> 02:10:33.493]  It's been used for multiple cultures forever and the recent research that's been coming out that's done by major universities like USC stated that your body in 72 hours will start producing immune stem cells and that means
[02:10:34.827 --> 02:10:36.068]  What else in the world is there?
[02:10:36.068 --> 02:10:38.170]  I've been studying natural medicine for over 20 years.
[02:10:38.170 --> 02:10:44.114]  There's nothing out there where you're going to stimulate and produce stem cells in less than 72 hours.
[02:10:44.114 --> 02:10:48.278]  So what happens is the digestive system completely shuts down.
[02:10:48.278 --> 02:11:00.968]  When the digestive system completely shuts down, your body is then able to focus 100% of its healing ability, because we all have a self-healing mechanism, which we talk about as being suppressed by all the chemicals and the toxins everywhere.
[02:11:02.293 --> 02:11:18.616]  Allows your body to go into a phase called autophagy, and that means your body seeks and destroys any abnormal tissue, and it goes into a regenerative mode and actually regenerates, starts regenerating your organs in your body.
[02:11:18.616 --> 02:11:20.577]  And that's been proven multiple times.
[02:11:20.577 --> 02:11:27.498]  It was known with the liver and the skin, but now I was reading these big studies, mainline science, it's everything but basically the corneas and the eye and a few other things.
[02:11:28.487 --> 02:11:32.650]  Yeah, and it's still debatable depending on the length of the fast that you do.
[02:11:32.650 --> 02:11:43.117]  I chose 18 days because after I was doing a lot of research on it, it seemed like it was a fairly safe way to do a fast in a time period that people can do.
[02:11:43.117 --> 02:11:44.418]  I've been a hardcore blob.
[02:11:44.418 --> 02:11:45.538]  I didn't work out for 10 years.
[02:11:45.538 --> 02:11:47.079]  I used to be a big sports enthusiast.
[02:11:47.079 --> 02:11:48.120]  Stopped doing it.
[02:11:48.120 --> 02:11:49.021]  Just got in a rut.
[02:11:49.021 --> 02:11:50.322]  Gained almost 100 pounds.
[02:11:50.322 --> 02:11:52.043]  I've lost like 60, 70.
[02:11:52.043 --> 02:11:53.624]  But I still have issues.
[02:11:53.624 --> 02:11:56.446]  I'm trying to get better and exercise better.
[02:11:56.446 --> 02:11:57.987]  Water supplements have really helped me.
[02:11:59.067 --> 02:12:02.230]  When you say I'm hardcore, I'm hardcore fatty.
[02:12:02.230 --> 02:12:11.836]  I've tried to fast before, and in about two days, I get higher than a kite, my brain's working really well, I can't sleep, and it's like so intense, it's like a drug.
[02:12:11.836 --> 02:12:13.817]  I can't imagine 18 days.
[02:12:13.817 --> 02:12:15.719]  I can't go more than two or three.
[02:12:15.719 --> 02:12:16.439]  What happened to you?
[02:12:16.439 --> 02:12:23.444]  I mean, because you were sending me nice little texts and things, but like, you know, by like day 12, Alex, I hope you're well, I love you.
[02:12:23.444 --> 02:12:27.967]  You know, and I normally get texts from you saying, and of course, you were obviously in a very spiritual place.
[02:12:28.667 --> 02:12:37.312]  No, it's true, and a lot of people do do fasting for spiritual reasons, and when I was resting and relaxing and meditating, it is the weirdest thing.
[02:12:37.312 --> 02:12:45.977]  It's almost like you become connected spiritually to the world, and you can, like, feel... Well, you were telling me that you can almost, like, see the pattern of the matrix.
[02:12:45.977 --> 02:12:46.537]  Yeah, you could.
[02:12:46.537 --> 02:12:50.299]  But it wasn't digital, it was just like... And I'm pretty clean.
[02:12:50.299 --> 02:12:54.462]  I eat very clean, I take supplements, and I avoid all the chemicals and toxins and stuff, and
[02:12:55.622 --> 02:13:02.326]  Uh, the first three days are always the hardest because you do have some cravings, but then after that, I really was not hungry.
[02:13:02.326 --> 02:13:03.967]  My energy levels were fine.
[02:13:03.967 --> 02:13:09.250]  It's a big myth also that if you fast on water only, you're going to lose a bunch of muscle mass.
[02:13:09.250 --> 02:13:10.851]  I went from 185 pounds to 157 pounds during 18 days.
[02:13:10.851 --> 02:13:13.092]  Now, I did not lose, but about six or seven ounces of muscle mass.
[02:13:13.092 --> 02:13:13.372]  You're kidding.
[02:13:21.897 --> 02:13:25.862]  Everything that I lost was fat because your body is in a stage of ketosis.
[02:13:25.862 --> 02:13:30.187]  So you start running and fueling your body only on fat cells.
[02:13:30.187 --> 02:13:34.412]  People don't realize that they have a lot of fat inside their body too.
[02:13:34.412 --> 02:13:36.034]  So it's not just the fat on the outside.
[02:13:36.034 --> 02:13:37.976]  You have the brown fat that's really bad.
[02:13:37.976 --> 02:13:39.297]  Well, any fat
[02:13:40.242 --> 02:13:49.589]  If you live a, you know, aggressive lifestyle with an aggressive, you know, poor diet, all that, those chemicals and toxins are going to be stored in your fat cells.
[02:13:49.589 --> 02:13:52.512]  So your body is going to choose what to attack.
[02:13:52.512 --> 02:13:54.593]  I mean, especially... But did you go through any detox?
[02:13:54.593 --> 02:14:00.578]  Because even if you're clean, there's stuff in the environment, because I've heard people like day 10 or so, you know, like purple pee, basically.
[02:14:00.578 --> 02:14:01.919]  It's just all this garbage comes out.
[02:14:02.079 --> 02:14:02.800]  Yeah, I did.
[02:14:02.800 --> 02:14:03.140]  I did.
[02:14:03.140 --> 02:14:13.712]  I went through detox, emotional detoxification and physical detoxification were times where I just felt like sleeping for hours at a time and then sometimes it was a roller coaster ride.
[02:14:13.712 --> 02:14:21.120]  I would have a lot of energy and then mentally, you know, yeah, I did get into those phases where it's just like you feel
[02:14:22.205 --> 02:14:27.729]  Like when I was thinking about you and I was thinking about all of the stuff that we're doing and what's taking place.
[02:14:27.729 --> 02:14:29.890]  You could almost predict the future in a way.
[02:14:29.890 --> 02:14:33.313]  I felt like we were in the middle of...
[02:14:34.571 --> 02:14:36.212]  Like you and I have felt for a long time.
[02:14:36.212 --> 02:14:48.857]  We're in the middle of a war, but if you look around and you see the things that are changing, and the subtle things, just like, you know, the stuff that's happening in Saudi Arabia with the princes, and the money, and the assets being frozen, and all these little things.
[02:14:48.857 --> 02:14:51.918]  And it's all the globalist forces that are getting knocked over.
[02:14:51.918 --> 02:14:55.499]  That they're getting knocked over, and the deep state is going down.
[02:14:56.980 --> 02:15:16.325]  The way that it's happening, like taking the money, most people don't know that the majority of the money in Washington is from Saudi Arabia and all the chemicals and all the things that are happening slowly are conditioned like the Uranium One scandal and all of these, you know, these hopeful indictments that are going to be happening.
[02:15:17.845 --> 02:15:26.948]  It would be hard to just come out and say, OK, we're going to arrest Hillary Clinton and we're going to arrest all these people because the majority of the population can't wrap their heads around that.
[02:15:26.948 --> 02:15:28.048]  That's not how you take it down.
[02:15:28.048 --> 02:15:29.989]  You take down the pillars of the corruption.
[02:15:29.989 --> 02:15:37.431]  And so it's this conditioning that's happening with, you know, people are starting to say, wait, maybe there is some corruption in the government, maybe.
[02:15:39.065 --> 02:15:42.226]  We're actually making these positive changes, and I can actually feel that taking place.
[02:15:42.226 --> 02:15:45.207]  And then they try to put it on us that we're corrupt, but then it turns out they're the ones that did it.
[02:15:45.207 --> 02:15:47.768]  So they even prepare the ground for their own downfall.
[02:15:47.768 --> 02:15:49.068]  You can see God doing it.
[02:15:49.068 --> 02:15:51.929]  You can see the mysterious ways the Lord works.
[02:15:51.929 --> 02:15:53.270]  Yes, you can see God's hand.
[02:15:53.270 --> 02:15:53.610]  We'll be back.
[02:15:54.651 --> 02:15:56.632]  Heart disease is on the rise.
[02:15:56.632 --> 02:16:03.534]  Clogged arteries, high blood pressure, and high cholesterol levels may not be fully detected by you, but the symptoms are there.
[02:16:03.534 --> 02:16:11.877]  Loss of energy, blood sugar spikes and drops, poor circulation, and irregular heartbeat are just a few of these that can alert you that something is wrong.
[02:16:11.877 --> 02:16:17.579]  Hear how heart and body extract is making a difference in thousands of people's lives across America.

[02:20:29.445 --> 02:20:32.186]  34-hour live global transmission kicked off at 8 a.m.
[02:20:32.186 --> 02:20:33.547]  this morning with David Knight.
[02:20:33.547 --> 02:20:34.687]  We've expanded the broadcast.
[02:20:34.687 --> 02:20:45.052]  We have The War Room with Owen Schroer, Roger Stone, and I'm lining up getting the crews hired to go right up until basically midnight every night.
[02:20:45.052 --> 02:20:47.533]  And that's because news is breaking all the time.
[02:20:47.533 --> 02:20:50.394]  We're not just here covering news, we're breaking a lot of news.
[02:20:51.949 --> 02:20:57.974]  Especially when big events happen, you want teams of journalists and researchers who know their stuff in place.
[02:20:57.974 --> 02:21:00.656]  And so InfoWars has been built by you, I want to thank you all.
[02:21:00.656 --> 02:21:08.742]  I was just talking to Dr. Grew during the break about Biome Defense, the probiotic that took him seven years to develop.
[02:21:08.742 --> 02:21:12.826]  And by the way, we've gone out and researched and obviously looked at other big companies and third parties have put out
[02:21:13.266 --> 02:21:16.189]  You know, other brands that aren't as much.
[02:21:16.189 --> 02:21:19.331]  But the problem is, is that they're just, you know, not even as good.
[02:21:19.331 --> 02:21:23.375]  I mean, there are some private labs putting stuff out there.
[02:21:23.375 --> 02:21:25.676]  $200, $300 are sold in elite laboratories.
[02:21:25.676 --> 02:21:28.038]  And this system is better.
[02:21:28.038 --> 02:21:29.400]  And I was talking about it.
[02:21:30.447 --> 02:21:42.113]  Ours has been sold out for months, but we're still doing an incredible 50% off because I want you to try Biome Defense 50 billion live cultures in each tablet for yourself and free shipping.
[02:21:42.113 --> 02:21:43.254]  And it's not because we can't sell it.
[02:21:43.254 --> 02:21:45.095]  It's been sold out for three and a half months.
[02:21:45.095 --> 02:21:49.678]  It's because I want you to see how great it is compared to other probiotics.
[02:21:49.678 --> 02:21:51.919]  I want you to experience it.

[02:22:09.070 --> 02:22:09.831]  We're talking shirts as low as $4.95.
[02:22:09.831 --> 02:22:10.371]  The average price $9.98.
[02:22:10.371 --> 02:22:11.392]  $9.98 on designer.
[02:22:11.392 --> 02:22:13.514]  Many of them made in America.
[02:22:21.221 --> 02:22:25.303]  Some of these shirts cost us what we're selling them for, but I want to get InfoWars out there.
[02:22:25.303 --> 02:22:27.004]  I want to get CNN's fake news out there.
[02:22:27.004 --> 02:22:29.385]  A lot of these shirts are limited edition.
[02:22:29.385 --> 02:22:31.426]  They're selling out right now.
[02:22:31.426 --> 02:22:32.747]  Trump is my president 2020.
[02:22:32.747 --> 02:22:35.588]  That's selling out limited edition.
[02:22:35.588 --> 02:22:36.268]  They're all there.
[02:22:36.268 --> 02:22:37.989]  The InfoWars in your face.
[02:22:37.989 --> 02:22:41.611]  Really powerful red on a navy blue background to spread the word.
[02:22:41.611 --> 02:22:42.652]  Moulin Lambe.
[02:22:42.652 --> 02:22:43.272]  Ball caps.

[02:23:03.826 --> 02:23:05.427]  Almost sold out four months.
[02:23:05.427 --> 02:23:07.909]  Infowarsstore.com, Infowarslife.com or 888-253-3139.
[02:23:07.909 --> 02:23:08.689]  Who can say those?
[02:23:08.689 --> 02:23:09.970]  I want the listeners to realize this.
[02:23:14.087 --> 02:23:30.074]  I think it's not bragging, it's realizing how thankful we are to God, how InfoWars and our guests and this whole system has been the critical chain reaction glue, along with Drudge Report and a few other outfits, that are globally leading against the New World Order, that is so incredibly evil.
[02:23:30.074 --> 02:23:34.976]  But just briefly, tell folks about biome defense and why it's so important.
[02:23:35.646 --> 02:23:49.837]  The number one reason why it's so important is because we have a planned attack on our digestive system by the pharmaceutical companies, by the big agri-companies, Monsanto... They're killing the gut, may admit it.
[02:23:49.837 --> 02:23:54.861]  They know that our life exists because of the life inside of our gut.
[02:23:54.861 --> 02:24:00.005]  And that's why it's so important to have good probiotics in your system.
[02:24:00.225 --> 02:24:08.491]  You're explaining this is custom-made, the only company out there, the only production you've done for us, explain it, that doesn't have chemical spray, that's kept basically livid.
[02:24:08.491 --> 02:24:18.177]  So anybody can pull up How to Stabilize, Heat Stabilize Probiotics, and look at the patents, and you will be completely shocked at what you're going to read.
[02:24:19.478 --> 02:24:27.883]  All the probiotics that are cultured, number one, are cultured on animal products a lot of times, they're cultured on dairy products a lot of times, and then they're spray-dried.
[02:24:27.883 --> 02:24:43.874]  And there's literally three or four coats of the most toxic chemicals you can find that are sprayed on probiotics to stabilize them, because people and these companies don't want to put probiotics out there unless they can say, okay, this is going to contain this amount of strains.
[02:24:44.654 --> 02:24:59.901]  The thing is, these are cancer-causing chemicals that the probiotics are being sprayed with, and that's why it took so long for us to develop, first of all, find a company that would work with us and create and culture the probiotics we want, just like in nature.
[02:24:59.901 --> 02:25:04.964]  Like, if you were going to eat and pick your own food, we wanted to come up with a blend.
[02:25:04.964 --> 02:25:07.625]  In nature, they're not sprayed with toxic chemicals.
[02:25:07.625 --> 02:25:09.666]  In nature, you have the perfect balance.
[02:25:09.666 --> 02:25:11.267]  In nature, they're not cultured on
[02:25:11.747 --> 02:25:12.188]  Thank you!
[02:25:24.582 --> 02:25:29.703]  It's gray or brown depending on the batch, just like wine or a food.
[02:25:29.703 --> 02:25:30.624]  It's real.
[02:25:30.624 --> 02:25:32.064]  It hasn't been bleached out.
[02:25:32.064 --> 02:25:33.144]  It's live.
[02:25:33.144 --> 02:25:35.765]  We don't spray it with any chemicals.
[02:25:35.765 --> 02:25:37.626]  It is dairy-free.
[02:25:37.626 --> 02:25:42.127]  Go around and find if you can find any probiotics out there that are dairy-free.
[02:25:42.127 --> 02:25:43.407]  This one's dairy-free.
[02:25:43.407 --> 02:25:46.128]  The activity level is extremely high.
[02:25:46.128 --> 02:25:49.429]  It has the perfect balance of probiotics that you need inside your gut.
[02:25:50.329 --> 02:25:52.851]  And a healthy gut is a healthy you.
[02:25:52.851 --> 02:25:59.476]  By the way, I know four people in this office with all these new gut syndromes and Crohn's and the rest of it that had irritable bowel.
[02:25:59.476 --> 02:26:01.898]  People that worked out, even tried to eat healthy.
[02:26:01.898 --> 02:26:03.420]  I said, you got to take probiotics.
[02:26:03.420 --> 02:26:04.500]  And they said, well, I've tried them.
[02:26:04.500 --> 02:26:05.361]  It didn't really help much.
[02:26:05.361 --> 02:26:06.722]  I said, try these.
[02:26:06.722 --> 02:26:08.804]  All four of them said, why is this different?
[02:26:08.804 --> 02:26:10.105]  It's gone within two months.
[02:26:10.105 --> 02:26:10.445]  Gone.
[02:26:10.445 --> 02:26:14.748]  But they also all lost a bunch of weight.
[02:26:14.748 --> 02:26:15.169]  It was weird.
[02:26:16.072 --> 02:26:25.222]  Well, because what happens when your balance is correct, and you don't have all that yeast overgrowth in there, and you don't have all those parasites, or you don't have all... You have balance.
[02:26:25.222 --> 02:26:26.904]  That's what we're looking for.
[02:26:26.904 --> 02:26:27.345]  Balance.
[02:26:27.345 --> 02:26:28.646]  You're able to break things down.
[02:26:28.646 --> 02:26:29.647]  So that's why it's so important.
[02:26:29.647 --> 02:26:31.830]  Well listen, this really is 50% off.
[02:26:31.830 --> 02:26:34.693]  When you do the free shipping on top of it, it's store-wide right now.
[02:26:34.693 --> 02:26:36.535]  It is a right-at-break-even.
[02:26:37.256 --> 02:26:37.856]  We're good to go.
[02:27:01.761 --> 02:27:04.502]  Yeah, I mean, we'll be able to really expand, okay?
[02:27:04.502 --> 02:27:09.344]  So, I mean, these are lost leaders, like people in the stores saying, try a piece of our pie.
[02:27:09.344 --> 02:27:10.725]  And you're like, well, wow, why?
[02:27:10.725 --> 02:27:12.286]  Because it's so good, you're going to buy a pie.
[02:27:12.286 --> 02:27:14.407]  I mean, that's what I'm doing here.
[02:27:14.407 --> 02:27:16.168]  A lot of this stuff is lost leader today.
[02:27:16.168 --> 02:27:21.730]  The t-shirts is about meeting like-minded people, spreading the word, infowarestore.com.
[02:27:21.730 --> 02:27:23.811]  And listen, now the prices are low.
[02:27:23.811 --> 02:27:28.833]  We've got with gold foil, Moana Labe, women's cut for your wife or girlfriend.
[02:27:28.833 --> 02:27:30.094]  We've got all sorts of other stuff.
[02:27:31.084 --> 02:27:33.205]  By the way, my kids will only sleep in the Infowars t-shirts at home because they're so soft.
[02:27:52.637 --> 02:27:57.899]  So, I'm telling you... Well, we used to have the regular ones that weren't super soft, but I said, well, I want to get the really soft, cool kind.
[02:27:57.899 --> 02:27:59.120]  So, we've kind of converted over to that.
[02:27:59.120 --> 02:27:59.560]  Thanks.
[02:27:59.560 --> 02:28:00.220]  So, anyway.
[02:28:00.220 --> 02:28:06.623]  So, every night, they're patriots and they're sleeping in an info... We still sell the old designs that are, like, regular, but a lot of them are real soft, yeah.
[02:28:06.623 --> 02:28:07.483]  Yeah, they love them.
[02:28:07.483 --> 02:28:08.544]  They love them.
[02:28:08.544 --> 02:28:10.224]  That's what they sleep in.
[02:28:10.224 --> 02:28:13.186]  Well, again, folks, also our local affiliates.
[02:28:13.186 --> 02:28:15.046]  Support those local stations.

[02:28:17.828 --> 02:28:20.469]  Tithe to local news that tells the truth.
[02:28:21.609 --> 02:28:23.091]  We've got to shop with the good guys.
[02:28:23.091 --> 02:28:24.051]  It's an economic war.
[02:28:24.051 --> 02:28:26.233]  They're trying to shut down America.
[02:28:26.233 --> 02:28:27.074]  Globalism tried.
[02:28:27.074 --> 02:28:28.395]  We're rebooting the country.
[02:28:28.395 --> 02:28:33.379]  But you've got to reboot the information warfare systems that are fearless and stalwart.
[02:28:33.379 --> 02:28:34.279]  Because we're just like you.
[02:28:34.279 --> 02:28:35.560]  We don't want to be slaves.
[02:28:35.560 --> 02:28:36.821]  I'm not saying, hey, I'm special.
[02:28:36.821 --> 02:28:37.222]  Look at me.
[02:28:37.222 --> 02:28:38.823]  I'm saying, I'm in a war.
[02:28:38.823 --> 02:28:39.784]  We're hitting the enemy hard.
[02:28:39.784 --> 02:28:41.065]  We're blowing the hell out of them.
[02:28:41.065 --> 02:28:42.026]  I need more ammunition.
[02:28:42.026 --> 02:28:43.947]  My artillery is smoking hot.
[02:28:43.947 --> 02:28:45.668]  And I'm running out of ammo here.
[02:28:45.668 --> 02:28:47.210]  And I'm hitting the enemy right between the eyes.
[02:28:47.210 --> 02:28:48.611]  But I need more ships to come in.
[02:28:48.911 --> 02:28:54.453]  Load it with munition and I will put it down their throats.
[02:28:54.453 --> 02:28:57.014]  Are you happy washing your hands with harsh chemicals?

[02:30:55.760 --> 02:30:58.882]  America is an information-based civil war.
[02:30:58.882 --> 02:31:06.328]  That's why now more than ever we've got to hit the streets of America and let these globalist scum know we're not backing down from their bullying.
[02:31:06.328 --> 02:31:11.932]  We're only intensifying our operations in the face of their wannabe dictatorship.
[02:31:12.652 --> 02:31:20.359]  Being a conservative, a nationalist, a libertarian, or simply a free speech advocate is truly the counterculture.
[02:31:20.359 --> 02:31:28.226]  The real punk rock is being a patriot who's pro-America, pro-capitalism, and pro-freedom, who at the same time is tolerant.
[02:31:28.946 --> 02:31:34.009]  Modern liberalism is a counterfeit of Thomas Jefferson's classical liberalism.
[02:31:34.009 --> 02:31:36.150]  They are the anti-liberals.
[02:31:36.150 --> 02:31:49.537]  To defend free speech, meet like-minded friends, and promote freedom worldwide, we've got more than 60 original designs of high-quality t-shirts for men and women, as well as more patriot apparel at InfoWarsTore.com.

[02:31:54.642 --> 02:31:56.604]  Dr. Grip, you developed Living Defense for us.
[02:31:56.604 --> 02:31:57.925]  It took you over a year to do it.
[02:31:57.925 --> 02:31:59.146]  Why is this so good?
[02:31:59.146 --> 02:32:04.411]  Because people are actually waking up to the problem that pretty much scares me the most.
[02:32:04.411 --> 02:32:17.964]  I mean, I try to make sure that I don't put toxins from food and water and beverages in my system, but right now we're dealing with massive parasites, which is anything that's harmful to your body that lives off a host mechanism.
[02:32:17.964 --> 02:32:19.325]  Right now with all the refugees,
[02:32:20.106 --> 02:32:21.749]  Uh, spreading disease around.
[02:32:21.749 --> 02:32:24.332]  We have biological warfare going on everywhere.
[02:32:24.332 --> 02:32:25.634]  These are all parasites.
[02:32:25.634 --> 02:32:26.735]  Tell us about all the stuff that's in it.
[02:32:26.735 --> 02:32:28.077]  There's so many things that are in it.
[02:32:28.077 --> 02:32:32.584]  You have the neem in there, you have the organic clove bud, the organic wormwood.
[02:32:32.584 --> 02:32:35.728]  I recommend doing a parasite cleanse at least twice a year.
[02:32:35.848 --> 02:32:38.889]  All right, well, I'm glad we've got some back in because I'm going back on it today.
[02:32:38.889 --> 02:32:39.950]  It just came back in yesterday.
[02:32:39.950 --> 02:32:41.890]  LivingDefense, Infowarslife.com.
[02:32:41.890 --> 02:32:42.911]  And folks, you can't lose.
[02:32:42.911 --> 02:32:45.592]  It's full of stuff that's great for your body, period.

[02:32:48.873 --> 02:32:51.114]  Thank you, Dr. Group from the Global Healing Center.
[02:32:51.114 --> 02:32:57.997]  Thank you so much for all your work, sir, on this great product.
[02:32:57.997 --> 02:33:00.658]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:33:22.583 --> 02:33:28.085]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[02:33:28.085 --> 02:33:33.907]  Live from the Infowars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[02:33:33.907 --> 02:33:37.388]  I want to be positive here.
[02:33:37.388 --> 02:33:46.271]  People always accuse me for 20 years or so of being negative, but no, I knew that there was a problem people needed to know about, so that we could fix it.
[02:33:46.271 --> 02:33:47.391]  But now that globally,
[02:33:49.142 --> 02:33:51.985]  Nationalists, populists are winning everywhere.
[02:33:51.985 --> 02:33:57.250]  And everywhere people are demanding non-GMO and they're demanding dangerous chemicals be taken out of things.
[02:33:57.250 --> 02:34:00.494]  I mean, people are really waking up.
[02:34:00.494 --> 02:34:03.156]  It's a very exciting time to be alive.
[02:34:03.156 --> 02:34:06.480]  But I wanted to open the callers up to talk about the election.
[02:34:08.035 --> 02:34:11.560]  To talk about one year later, what has Trump done that's right?
[02:34:11.560 --> 02:34:12.962]  What has he done that's wrong?
[02:34:12.962 --> 02:34:15.184]  He's done a lot of good things that have been positive.
[02:34:15.184 --> 02:34:17.447]  He's done some things that he said he wouldn't do.
[02:34:17.447 --> 02:34:20.852]  I mean, where's the commission to expose the vaccine damage?
[02:34:20.852 --> 02:34:25.077]  Why is he saying go after WikiLeaks when they helped get him elected and I think did a great service?
[02:34:26.229 --> 02:34:28.551]  For our Republic.
[02:34:28.551 --> 02:34:30.873]  There's some issues, but I want to get your take on it.
[02:34:30.873 --> 02:34:34.376]  The toll-free number is 877-789-ALEX.
[02:34:34.376 --> 02:34:35.677]  877-789-2539.
[02:34:35.677 --> 02:34:42.123]  Dr. Group and I will ride a little bit shotgun in the next hour when Roger Stone is going to be joining us.
[02:34:42.123 --> 02:34:51.992]  He told me three months ago, so did Dr. Corsi, because they go to dinner with some of the high-powered folks in D.C.
[02:34:55.026 --> 02:34:57.907]  And we're not toting up the power structure.
[02:34:57.907 --> 02:35:00.367]  We are inside of it to figure out what's going on.
[02:35:00.367 --> 02:35:19.572]  When I send these guys into big lobbying meetings and things to see what's going on, and the word was even then that they wouldn't let the AT&T-Time Warner merger happen unless CNN was spun off so they could continue its warfare against the U.S.
[02:35:19.572 --> 02:35:23.573]  And that's the Obama holdovers of the Justice Department that are doing that.
[02:35:24.815 --> 02:35:28.678]  So, here's Google with a true monopoly, here's Facebook, here's Twitter.
[02:35:28.678 --> 02:35:35.182]  On C-SPAN, a few months ago, and again last Friday, saying, oh, we censored InfoWars at lunch.
[02:35:35.182 --> 02:35:46.630]  The head of Twitter, of operations, said, oh yes, Congressman Wigley, I'm not joking, that's his name, we saw that InfoWars was number one and we blocked it.
[02:35:46.630 --> 02:35:51.393]  Their fake news that de Blasio is soft on Islamic terror, that there was a truck attack.
[02:35:51.393 --> 02:35:52.674]  It was all true.
[02:35:52.674 --> 02:35:54.495]  It was linked to the imam speaking out.
[02:35:56.203 --> 02:35:59.186]  Well, now today, here's an example.
[02:35:59.186 --> 02:36:07.774]  They say, okay, you got to spend CNN off because, again, we want to keep it basically where it is politically.
[02:36:07.774 --> 02:36:11.678]  The Democrats want their little propaganda outfit.
[02:36:11.678 --> 02:36:16.322]  So I guess they can say, look, mom, I'm on TV, even though almost no one watches and it's a laughingstock.
[02:36:16.322 --> 02:36:20.226]  But that just shows how we get the news months and months and months and months before.
[02:36:21.764 --> 02:36:33.130]  On Donna Brazile, the stealing of the nomination from Sanders, or the JFK files, or the fact that he went to the Middle East and had Islamic paraphernalia in Vegas.
[02:36:33.130 --> 02:36:37.513]  I mean, the real reason they hate us is, we're really telling the truth.
[02:36:37.513 --> 02:36:42.235]  And we figured out how stuff works, and we have the contacts, and that upsets them.
[02:36:42.235 --> 02:36:45.337]  That really, really upsets the deep state.
[02:36:45.337 --> 02:36:46.677]  So I wanted to get your take on that.
[02:36:46.677 --> 02:36:47.598]  The toll-free number is 877-789-ALEX.
[02:36:49.699 --> 02:36:58.446]  I wanted to get your take on where we are historically right now, and then I want to talk about nightmare technologies that are being deployed to control us.
[02:36:58.446 --> 02:37:03.010]  You've got 5G news that I heard you talking about a few years ago, now it's mainstream news.
[02:37:03.010 --> 02:37:06.773]  I've also got, like I mentioned, scientists are implanting tiny human brains into rats.
[02:37:06.773 --> 02:37:08.795]  I want to get into that as well with you right now.
[02:37:08.795 --> 02:37:12.418]  And again, we're not being negative here, fear-mongering.
[02:37:12.418 --> 02:37:16.221]  We're saying we should have respect for animal life.
[02:37:17.691 --> 02:37:39.920]  We should have respect for human life, and we should have protections for both that are reasonable, but the no-man's land of animal-human hybrids, the reason for 30 years they've been obsessed with them is because there's no law in that area, and it's the wild, wild west, and why I'm concerned is they're going public now, which means they're going from beta into operational into retail.
[02:37:40.851 --> 02:37:42.512]  This is the full rollout right now.
[02:37:42.512 --> 02:37:46.335]  I notice this is the thing they really hate.
[02:37:46.335 --> 02:37:49.297]  We're talking about chemicals in the water to change us by design.
[02:37:49.297 --> 02:37:49.977]  Show the documents.
[02:37:49.977 --> 02:37:50.778]  They hate that.
[02:37:50.778 --> 02:37:52.079]  Talk about human-animal hybrids.
[02:37:52.079 --> 02:37:52.859]  That's their ooh.
[02:37:52.859 --> 02:37:54.260]  They do not like me talking about that.
[02:37:54.260 --> 02:37:54.780]  Why is that?
[02:37:54.780 --> 02:37:56.562]  They don't like the frog scenario too.
[02:37:56.562 --> 02:37:59.383]  I mean, with all the pesticide residue.
[02:37:59.383 --> 02:38:05.047]  It's just a big plan for population control and it's a big plan to keep people sick and keep people dumbed down.
[02:38:05.047 --> 02:38:10.191]  But they're losing because people are smart and they're starting to cleanse their bodies and they're starting to realize
[02:38:10.971 --> 02:38:20.501]  And understand that their environment is becoming toxic, and they need to cleanse their body, and they need to become aware, and people are becoming awake.
[02:38:20.501 --> 02:38:28.489]  And just like you said, what's happening now is the scary part, and not to be fear-mongering at all, but you have to understand and know about all this.
[02:38:28.489 --> 02:38:34.055]  Well, the Crown Prince of England, he just came out and echoed his grandfather, Prince Philip, and said, we need world government to reduce population.
[02:38:35.609 --> 02:38:38.150]  Well, you know, they come out and say it has been the plan.
[02:38:38.150 --> 02:38:42.113]  Look at what's happening in Hollywood right now with the pedophilia.
[02:38:42.113 --> 02:38:46.195]  Everything is being exposed in just the right moment.
[02:38:46.195 --> 02:38:47.956]  So people are... Yeah, why is that?
[02:38:47.956 --> 02:38:49.677]  Again, it's God.
[02:38:49.677 --> 02:38:50.578]  It's God.
[02:38:50.578 --> 02:38:51.998]  It's everything.
[02:38:51.998 --> 02:38:57.362]  The harder they try to fight it, it seems like everything's backfiring more and more and more and more in their face.
[02:38:57.362 --> 02:38:59.343]  And people, like even the people that are
[02:39:00.163 --> 02:39:13.247]  So conditioned that they just could not believe that our government or the Democratic Party or Hillary or whoever could be involved in any type of conspiracy or any type of, you know, negative thing against the country.
[02:39:13.247 --> 02:39:21.230]  I mean, you're starting to see the connection, the global, the world order connection with individuals going down.
[02:39:22.330 --> 02:39:29.854]  I mean there's obviously some military action taking place that's not being talked about right now with all of our aircraft carriers deployed.
[02:39:29.854 --> 02:39:32.075]  There's things going on behind the scenes.
[02:39:32.075 --> 02:39:36.778]  And you're an army veteran yourself in special groups over in South Korea.
[02:39:36.778 --> 02:39:37.098]  Give us your
[02:39:37.598 --> 02:39:44.027]  Yeah, I know, because we actually help a lot of those soldiers and a lot of those organizations out when they come back.
[02:39:44.027 --> 02:39:50.936]  We help them with PTSD when they're suffering and the medical profession wants to put them on a bunch of medications and they're committing suicide.
[02:39:50.936 --> 02:39:55.582]  But from your deployment on the DMZ, is this all a bunch of hot air or is this serious?
[02:39:57.307 --> 02:39:58.908]  I think it's a combination of both.
[02:40:15.834 --> 02:40:17.275]  Leadership is falling.
[02:40:17.275 --> 02:40:18.876]  Look at what's happening in the EU.
[02:40:18.876 --> 02:40:20.276]  The EU is falling apart.
[02:40:20.276 --> 02:40:25.399]  The control mechanisms that have been put in place are starting to crumble down.
[02:40:25.399 --> 02:40:28.220]  It's because people are becoming more educated.
[02:40:28.220 --> 02:40:39.186]  And that's why they're shifting to more technological silent killers like the 5G scenario, like the mosquitoes that they're releasing everywhere, like the
[02:40:40.446 --> 02:40:48.891]  Artificial intelligence now, which you were talking about, how they're able to control free speech and knock you off the first page.
[02:40:48.891 --> 02:40:55.474]  And by the way, mainstream news, top economists, EU has already failed, it will collapse.
[02:40:55.474 --> 02:40:57.596]  German government prepares for EU collapse.
[02:40:57.596 --> 02:41:02.518]  Juncker, the heir of the Nazi fortune, just threatened Trump a year ago and said, we'll crush America.
[02:41:02.518 --> 02:41:03.779]  What an arrogant piece of garbage.
[02:41:05.788 --> 02:41:17.234]  So, you know, what we have to look out for and what we have to prepare ourselves for and have to be aware of is some of these technologies that we get told about years in advance.
[02:41:17.234 --> 02:41:20.356]  And they go, oh, by the way, we know 3G gives you cancer.
[02:41:20.356 --> 02:41:21.997]  That's been admitted for 20 years.
[02:41:21.997 --> 02:41:24.278]  I mean, they know full well what they're doing.
[02:41:24.278 --> 02:41:30.162]  Causes mutations, breaks in DNA, causes ant colonies and bee colonies to go insane.
[02:41:30.162 --> 02:41:31.022]  This is all confirmed.
[02:41:31.022 --> 02:41:31.623]  So what does 5G do?
[02:41:33.314 --> 02:41:49.644]  So, this just came out the other day, 5G is a technology that promises to put the internet of things together, and state legislatures are rapidly, because the EPA and the FCC, we obviously know those are all controlled by the
[02:41:49.844 --> 02:41:54.325]  They're forcing robot cars, 5G that actually looks through all your walls.
[02:41:54.325 --> 02:41:55.946]  That's really what it is.
[02:41:55.946 --> 02:41:58.447]  Basically, they're even talking about microchipping people.
[02:41:58.447 --> 02:42:01.508]  No, no, Sweden's making you get chips to ride the bus.
[02:42:01.508 --> 02:42:02.008]  It's already here.
[02:42:02.008 --> 02:42:02.928]  Right.
[02:42:02.928 --> 02:42:04.028]  It is already here.
[02:42:04.028 --> 02:42:08.550]  And so the 5G... And see how once it's here, it's like, okay, they're making you get chips in 25 countries.
[02:42:08.550 --> 02:42:08.850]  Big deal.
[02:42:10.232 --> 02:42:11.253]  Listen to this.
[02:42:11.253 --> 02:42:22.239]  I found out that Comcast is using private home routers for Wi-Fi hotspots and they've already installed the 5G network in there.
[02:42:22.239 --> 02:42:29.043]  You can actually call up Comcast and you need to tell them they need to turn off their 5G.
[02:42:29.043 --> 02:42:32.765]  It's a hidden network so that means they're using all of the home routers.
[02:42:32.765 --> 02:42:33.526]  Let me stop you.
[02:42:33.826 --> 02:42:37.107]  Because they can get such great data, communicate with all your other devices.
[02:42:37.107 --> 02:42:46.091]  It's an Imperial Probe Droid, beyond the smart meter on your wall doing it outside, that is scanning everything in your home and stealing the data, just like the Google cars.
[02:42:46.091 --> 02:42:48.372]  And that's the integrated voice communication system.
[02:42:48.372 --> 02:42:49.912]  Yeah, let's talk about it when we come back.
[02:42:49.912 --> 02:42:50.772]  That's right.
[02:42:50.772 --> 02:42:51.873]  An Imperial Probe Droid.

[02:44:13.464 --> 02:44:24.872]  Really, really good news is that yes, we're having to end the sale of 50% off on Anthroplex, but DNA Force after almost four months out of stock is back in stock.
[02:44:24.872 --> 02:44:26.493]  25% off our flagship product.

[02:44:39.982 --> 02:44:44.105]  And there's other sales that are still going, but they're all about to end.

[02:47:17.438 --> 02:47:22.184]  We're going to get to some of that historic night's protest with myself and Roger Stone the next hour.
[02:47:22.184 --> 02:47:23.645]  Some excerpts of it.
[02:47:23.645 --> 02:47:30.213]  The left is freaking out that they couldn't control us and run our lives and they weren't the anointed super intellectuals that controlled everyone.
[02:47:30.213 --> 02:47:31.755]  And again, these aren't even real liberals.
[02:47:31.755 --> 02:47:34.618]  I got arrested by George W. Bush twice.
[02:47:34.618 --> 02:47:36.900]  I exposed the whole neocon operation, all the wars.
[02:47:37.941 --> 02:47:46.726]  These are corporate shills that pose as leftists and then demonize trying to cut our taxes, trying to cut the corporate tax so jobs come back to America.
[02:47:46.726 --> 02:47:48.807]  These are people that think they own us.
[02:47:48.807 --> 02:48:00.234]  I've got a clip coming up in the next hour of Democrats just savagely tearing into a black lady that dares to expose the fact that abortion targets African-Americans unfairly, that Margaret Sanger set it up to do so.
[02:48:00.894 --> 02:48:02.635]  I played it yesterday, but it's so powerful.
[02:48:02.635 --> 02:48:03.335]  I'm going to play it again.
[02:48:03.335 --> 02:48:04.536]  We've got phone calls here.
[02:48:04.536 --> 02:48:07.237]  We're going to take now and into the next hour.
[02:48:07.237 --> 02:48:09.418]  Roger Stone's going to be joining us riding shotgun.
[02:48:09.418 --> 02:48:18.243]  But Dr. Group, get back into the routers in the cable boxes, in the switchers, in the systems, have always been carrying
[02:48:19.143 --> 02:48:32.373]  This tech to watch and spy and gather proprietary information, dial into things in the home, and literally bathe your home in this 5G while spying on you.
[02:48:32.373 --> 02:48:34.314]  And again, it's all about forcing it on us.
[02:48:34.314 --> 02:48:35.035]  Forcing.
[02:48:35.035 --> 02:48:36.156]  I told people 20 years ago.
[02:48:37.279 --> 02:48:40.400]  They had cameras and microphones and scientific Atlantic cable boxes.
[02:48:40.400 --> 02:48:41.461]  It all came out later.
[02:48:41.461 --> 02:48:42.701]  Google now admits they're doing it.
[02:48:42.701 --> 02:48:47.383]  Samsung, in your terms of service, 20 pages in, says, watch what you say.
[02:48:47.383 --> 02:48:52.205]  We have cameras and microphones and third parties subscribe to listen to you.
[02:48:52.205 --> 02:48:57.347]  So the government, through a subscription, can just go through your house and watch and listen to you, Dr. Group.
[02:48:57.347 --> 02:48:58.067]  That's pretty scary.
[02:48:58.067 --> 02:48:59.848]  They know every single thing about you.
[02:48:59.848 --> 02:49:03.249]  If you do use those devices, I mean, even cell phones, I mean, we're
[02:49:03.949 --> 02:49:10.654]  These days with everybody in social media all the time, I mean it's, you know, they sell that information to advertisers.
[02:49:10.654 --> 02:49:11.835]  And that's bad enough though.
[02:49:11.835 --> 02:49:14.797]  This is breaking into your house, doing it beyond Big Brother.
[02:49:14.797 --> 02:49:16.238]  So tell folks what you discovered.
[02:49:16.238 --> 02:49:27.707]  I just like to issue health warnings to people because these are serious things and recently it's something that I've been looking into and it's the implementation of the 5G.
[02:49:27.707 --> 02:49:28.367]  Let's just stop.
[02:49:28.367 --> 02:49:28.908]  I have to interrupt.
[02:49:29.508 --> 02:49:37.531]  They're putting CNET News, all of it, years after we told you on screen, going, oh, Samsung records the chatter and watches it and listens and sells it.
[02:49:38.354 --> 02:49:42.616]  Think about if your neighbor you caught in your corner listening to you, you'd kick their butt.
[02:49:42.616 --> 02:49:44.717]  But again, they just do it.
[02:49:44.717 --> 02:49:46.018]  They just do it.
[02:49:46.018 --> 02:49:47.819]  They're just doing it.
[02:49:47.819 --> 02:49:51.461]  And I'm even thinking to myself, I don't even watch TV hardly.
[02:49:51.461 --> 02:49:53.502]  Why do I have these smart TVs in my house?
[02:49:53.502 --> 02:49:58.704]  Why haven't I even told my wife or myself, go in and turn off the permissions, which I've done before.
[02:49:58.704 --> 02:50:02.926]  But it just shows like an old TV breaks, you put a new one in, it's even creeping in on me.
[02:50:02.926 --> 02:50:03.847]  That's just how they do it.
[02:50:05.237 --> 02:50:09.038]  Yeah, that's exactly how they do it.
[02:50:09.038 --> 02:50:19.441]  The thing is, when you can't see it, feel it, touch it, hear it, that's the things that make me the most nervous, because that's having an effect.
[02:50:19.441 --> 02:50:32.084]  Like Masaru Emoto, who was doing a study on the effects of water, and out of every single thing he tested in water, the most damaging effects came from electromagnetic frequencies, microwave radiation.
[02:50:32.084 --> 02:50:33.945]  Yet we still microwave our foods.
[02:50:34.705 --> 02:50:38.331]  We expose ourselves to massive amounts of electromagnetic frequencies.
[02:50:38.331 --> 02:50:39.352]  By the way, I just thought of this.
[02:50:39.352 --> 02:50:41.155]  Dangerous electromagnetic frequencies.
[02:50:41.155 --> 02:50:42.377]  You're getting into how it's bad for us.
[02:50:42.377 --> 02:50:44.601]  I'm getting into how they're spying and dialing and everything.
[02:50:44.601 --> 02:50:49.749]  Remember all the old movies where, like, you'd go in the creepy castle and the eyes are following you through the painting?
[02:50:50.189 --> 02:50:52.210]  I mean, why do we put up with this?
[02:50:52.210 --> 02:50:53.071]  But think about this.
[02:50:53.071 --> 02:50:55.152]  But how about how we're vindicated?
[02:50:55.152 --> 02:51:02.676]  But the eyes aren't following you now, they're radiating these things going... So instead, it's like Zod shooting lasers.
[02:51:02.676 --> 02:51:17.585]  It's shooting harmful microwave radiation into your body, which, look, the coming upgrade to 5G is likely going to lead to disastrous biological effects because of the amount of dehydration inside cells that it will cause.
[02:51:18.365 --> 02:51:19.106]  It's more dangerous.
[02:51:36.823 --> 02:51:42.706]  So, think about all the news every single day about terror organizations and terrorist groups.
[02:51:42.706 --> 02:51:48.348]  This is more dangerous than a terror group because this one kills you without you even knowing.
[02:51:48.348 --> 02:51:51.369]  Terrorist organization found in most US homes.
[02:51:51.369 --> 02:51:52.410]  There's your headline.
[02:51:52.410 --> 02:51:52.570]  Yeah.
[02:51:54.018 --> 02:52:04.547]  But again, it's the magnitude and the organized evil of it, when even 40 years ago, when they first came out with cell phones, I remember the top engineer over the program went public and said, this needs to be studied.
[02:52:04.547 --> 02:52:08.030]  Our early studies show increased cancer in rats, and that was much weaker!
[02:52:09.144 --> 02:52:22.587]  If they came and knocked on your door when you called for Wi-Fi for them to come and hook up internet access at your house and they said, do you mind if we put a small cell phone tower in your house to where people can access it if they're driving by and it acts as a router, what would you say?
[02:52:22.587 --> 02:52:26.048]  And, oh by the way, the cell tower also dials in everything you're doing.
[02:52:26.048 --> 02:52:26.768]  It also listens.
[02:52:26.768 --> 02:52:32.509]  Yeah, we're putting a Wi-Fi system in your houses and making you pay for it while we're at it and spying on you.
[02:52:32.509 --> 02:52:33.009]  How's that sound?
[02:52:33.009 --> 02:52:37.350]  You're basically hosting a mini cell phone tower in your home
[02:52:38.123 --> 02:52:38.183]  Is
[02:52:54.940 --> 02:52:59.382]  Imagine if aliens landed and put little antennas in your house that slowly kill you and spy on you.
[02:52:59.382 --> 02:53:00.362]  We'd smash them.
[02:53:00.362 --> 02:53:04.944]  But because it's corporations and we've been trained to love it and buy it, we pay to die.
[02:53:04.944 --> 02:53:06.404]  We pay to be spied on.
[02:53:06.404 --> 02:53:07.025]  We pay.
[02:53:07.025 --> 02:53:07.505]  We pay.
[02:53:07.505 --> 02:53:08.525]  Yeah, and they're just laughing.
[02:53:08.525 --> 02:53:09.486]  They're like, ha ha ha.
[02:53:09.486 --> 02:53:10.346]  They're paying, Finn.
[02:53:10.346 --> 02:53:12.407]  We're killing them and they're going to be sterile.
[02:53:12.407 --> 02:53:15.268]  Because one of the things... Here is your antenna.
[02:53:15.268 --> 02:53:16.988]  Prepare to meet your maker.
[02:53:16.988 --> 02:53:18.569]  It will help kill you slowly.
[02:53:18.769 --> 02:53:20.990]  So you know how everything is an attack on the brain, right?
[02:53:20.990 --> 02:53:22.992]  The fluoride, chlorine, bromine, and everything?
[02:53:22.992 --> 02:53:29.136]  Cell phone towers and cell phones rattle the DNA until it breaks within minutes!
[02:53:29.136 --> 02:53:30.797]  Attack four things.
[02:53:30.797 --> 02:53:45.726]  Our health, brain function, dumb us down, integrity of our genomes, breaks the DNA strands, and our ability to produce healthy offspring, which means it creates sterility.
[02:53:45.726 --> 02:53:46.007]  Again,
[02:53:46.747 --> 02:54:04.677]  With all the phthalates, with all of the endocrine disrupting chemicals that we're exposed to, that are all attacking our hormonal system to cause sterility with the glyphosate and all of the GMO foods and the attack on our gut and all the chemicals.
[02:54:04.677 --> 02:54:08.359]  And the sperm counts down 90%?
[02:54:08.359 --> 02:54:14.823]  Like we were talking about last time, they're going to be looking for people, people are going to be paying a million dollars an ounce for clean sperm.
[02:54:15.683 --> 02:54:23.149]  I mean like that's going to be a big time business in the future.
[02:54:23.149 --> 02:54:26.092]  So anyway, it is something that people should be aware of.
[02:54:26.092 --> 02:54:36.760]  If you do have wireless routers, look if your city is thinking about implementing... By the way, I'm not against the fact that Obama's a sperm bank.
[02:54:36.760 --> 02:54:39.422]  How much would you pay for Obama's sperm?
[02:54:41.638 --> 02:54:43.140]  We're trolling the media, folks.
[02:54:43.140 --> 02:54:44.381]  It's a joke.
[02:54:44.381 --> 02:54:45.562]  Okay, let's stop right there.
[02:54:45.562 --> 02:54:46.483]  I want to go to some phone calls.
[02:54:46.483 --> 02:54:46.984]  I got to do it.
[02:54:46.984 --> 02:54:48.125]  Okay, let me read one thing.
[02:54:48.125 --> 02:54:53.872]  The California Medical Association, the branch of the AMA, wrote this in 2014.
[02:54:53.872 --> 02:55:02.001]  Peer-reviewed research has demonstrated adverse biological effects of wireless EMF, including single and double-stranded DNA breaks.
[02:55:02.441 --> 02:55:20.349]  Creation of reactive oxygen species, immune dysfunction, cognitive processing effects, stress protein synthesis in the brain, altered brain development, sleep and memory disturbances, ADHD, abnormal behavior, so they can sell you the mental drug, sperm dysfunction, and brain tumors.
[02:55:20.349 --> 02:55:21.149]  Be aware.
[02:55:21.149 --> 02:55:21.609]  Be aware.
[02:55:21.609 --> 02:55:22.430]  And here's the bottom line.
[02:55:22.950 --> 02:55:29.879]  Twenty years ago I would read articles about cell phones within one minute breaking DNA and the DNA strands and then there it is in the new report.
[02:55:29.879 --> 02:55:32.082]  Yeah, I mean that's been out, been getting tested.
[02:55:32.082 --> 02:55:33.904]  Twenty years ago they admitted that...
[02:55:34.984 --> 02:55:39.686]  A few minutes a day on a cell phone raises brain temperature up to a degree.
[02:55:39.686 --> 02:55:40.206]  Yes.
[02:55:40.206 --> 02:55:42.827]  It actually heats your brain!
[02:55:42.827 --> 02:55:49.949]  They knew back in the 40s when they first got radar, they didn't think, and guys would stand in front of it to warm up, but then they'd be dead a month later.
[02:55:49.949 --> 02:55:54.151]  And so the military put out memos saying, don't stand in front of the radar!
[02:55:55.469 --> 02:55:57.290]  They heat their food up in front of it, too.
[02:55:57.290 --> 02:55:58.951]  It's the same deal!
[02:55:58.951 --> 02:56:12.720]  And now you can't sue the wireless companies because they already have all those government protections, so just like... Can you imagine a man in the Army Air Corps in 1946 and you think, I'll just stand in front of the radar.
[02:56:12.720 --> 02:56:13.641]  Boy, it makes me warm.
[02:56:13.641 --> 02:56:14.821]  It didn't though?
[02:56:16.164 --> 02:56:16.925]  What about Los Alamos?
[02:56:16.925 --> 02:56:18.806]  You know the scientists knew though.
[02:56:18.806 --> 02:56:20.387]  Hey boys, don't stand in front of the radar.
[02:56:20.387 --> 02:56:21.048]  It'll kill you.
[02:56:21.048 --> 02:56:22.769]  Look at what's happening.
[02:56:22.769 --> 02:56:23.790]  Look, here's another study.
[02:56:23.790 --> 02:56:31.376]  Chemotherapy may damage fertility of patients' children, which means if you have chemotherapy now, the offspring
[02:56:31.596 --> 02:56:33.496]  And we've always known that chemicals do that.
[02:56:33.496 --> 02:56:35.597]  I mean, we are under major attack.
[02:56:35.597 --> 02:56:36.397]  72% fewer babies.
[02:56:36.397 --> 02:56:37.037]  We're going to break.
[02:56:37.037 --> 02:56:41.979]  We're going to come back, I promise, and go to Michael, Noel, Scott, Al, Danny, Jason, Kevin, and others.
[02:56:41.979 --> 02:56:43.819]  Don't forget, store-wide free shipping.
[02:56:43.819 --> 02:56:44.939]  We hardly ever do that.
[02:56:44.939 --> 02:56:46.760]  Infowarsstore.com.

[02:56:53.962 --> 02:56:55.082]  We need to fund our operation.

[02:57:30.104 --> 02:57:36.529]  The good news is if humanity wakes up, we can as consumers change all this, but not if we wait much longer.
[02:57:36.529 --> 02:57:37.230]  We'll be back.
[02:57:37.230 --> 02:57:38.030]  Hour number four.
[02:57:38.030 --> 02:57:38.751]  Your phone calls.
[02:57:38.751 --> 02:57:39.631]  Roger Stone.
[02:57:39.631 --> 02:57:40.452]  Dr. Group.
[02:57:40.452 --> 02:57:42.053]  It's the 34-hour transmission.
[02:57:42.053 --> 02:57:44.275]  We're four hours in.
[02:57:44.275 --> 02:57:51.821]  I want to plow into all of this, but I'm going to spend a few minutes here first just encouraging listeners to understand that
[02:57:53.385 --> 02:58:04.216]  When you buy t-shirts, or water filtration systems, or books, or videos, or other materiel from infowarsstore.com, you are funding the revolution.
[02:58:04.216 --> 02:58:06.359]  I mean, I cannot say it any clearer.
[02:58:06.359 --> 02:58:10.082]  And so it is essential that you purchase the products at infowarsstore.com.
[02:58:10.082 --> 02:58:11.564]  I don't want to thank everybody that has, but

[02:58:19.970 --> 02:58:22.611]  We've got the best mouthwash designed by Dr. Jones.
[02:58:22.611 --> 02:58:25.413]  That's my dad, with colloidal silver and iodine as well.

[03:00:06.795 --> 03:00:13.761]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[03:00:13.761 --> 03:00:15.482]  All right, Roger Stoesman.
[03:00:15.482 --> 03:00:17.143]  He'll be riding shotgun with us here in a minute.
[03:00:17.143 --> 03:00:19.425]  We're seven hours in, Nico pointed out to me.
[03:00:19.425 --> 03:00:20.826]  I was thinking of my own show.
[03:00:20.826 --> 03:00:22.888]  Four hours in, but David Knight started at 8 a.m.
[03:00:24.488 --> 03:00:27.549]  We're celebrating the big win, but also looking at the big problems we face.
[03:00:27.549 --> 03:00:32.331]  We're also talking about the successes we've had with Trump, but also the places he hadn't done the best job.
[03:00:32.331 --> 03:00:37.153]  But Michael, Noel, Scott, Al, Danny, Kevin, everybody, we're going to you.
[03:00:37.153 --> 03:00:41.635]  Danny and then others here in just a moment.
[03:00:41.635 --> 03:00:44.576]  One of the callers wanted to get into Soros, but he just hung up.
[03:00:44.576 --> 03:00:46.196]  How to defeat Soros.
[03:00:46.196 --> 03:00:47.857]  But right now, I just want to point something out.
[03:00:48.604 --> 03:00:50.626]  I'm just not out to get humanity.
[03:00:50.626 --> 03:00:56.250]  I don't want to put many cell towers in all your houses and admit give us all cancer, but I'm not in a trance.
[03:00:57.406 --> 03:01:03.812]  So many other people are kind of in a trance and they think if you try to warn them, you're like trying to mess up their daydream.
[03:01:03.812 --> 03:01:05.193]  And that's actually medically happened.
[03:01:05.193 --> 03:01:12.039]  The average person has lower brainwaves than they did just 50 years ago and is in a near hypnotic trance.
[03:01:12.039 --> 03:01:14.381]  And so we're here to get people to break their conditioning.
[03:01:14.381 --> 03:01:17.724]  We don't have the NPR sleepy time.
[03:01:17.724 --> 03:01:18.805]  Everything's okay.
[03:01:18.805 --> 03:01:20.046]  Stay where you're at.
[03:01:20.046 --> 03:01:20.807]  Everything's fine.
[03:01:21.127 --> 03:01:24.929]  I'm like a record skipping or a car wreck happening.
[03:01:24.929 --> 03:01:26.229]  I'm here to get you awake.
[03:01:26.229 --> 03:01:27.110]  Dr. Group?
[03:01:27.110 --> 03:01:39.595]  No, well, if you notice what's happened over the last 50 to 100 years, it's more of an attack on the children these days now because what they're trying to do is try to prevent people like you from showing up.
[03:01:39.595 --> 03:01:48.739]  And so they're trying to get all these kids mentally screened, diagnosed with bipolar, diagnosed with mental disorders so they can always say, oh,
[03:01:49.119 --> 03:01:50.380]  He had a mental disorder.
[03:01:50.380 --> 03:01:53.322]  He was diagnosed and he was screened when he was eight years old.
[03:01:53.322 --> 03:01:54.342]  That's what they're doing now.
[03:01:54.342 --> 03:01:56.244]  That's how sick they are.
[03:01:56.244 --> 03:02:05.049]  They disrupt you, they give you all the red dyes, the chemicals, the electromagnetic, the culture, the TV shows for kids have no attention span or mentally ill on purpose.
[03:02:05.049 --> 03:02:08.532]  Nickelodeon, Viacom admit to fry their brains.
[03:02:08.532 --> 03:02:10.713]  Everything is a total attack.
[03:02:10.713 --> 03:02:12.294]  Let's go to calls here.
[03:02:12.294 --> 03:02:13.115]  Let's talk to Danny.
[03:02:13.115 --> 03:02:14.015]  Let's talk to Dr. Group.
[03:02:14.015 --> 03:02:16.297]  You're on the air, Danny.
[03:02:16.297 --> 03:02:16.437]  Hi.
[03:02:17.150 --> 03:02:23.055]  The nascent iodine, the B12, and the super male are incredible products.
[03:02:23.055 --> 03:02:24.657]  Thank you.
[03:02:24.657 --> 03:02:34.546]  I would like to ask Dr. Group, are there any supplements or products that help promote the growth of stem cells, and would you consider making one, if there is?
[03:02:35.282 --> 03:02:49.113]  Well, the DNA force is probably the biggest product that's designed to do that, but the fastest way to stimulate stem cells, and this was a study by USC, we were talking about it earlier, is water-only fasting.
[03:02:49.113 --> 03:02:58.820]  I haven't found anything in my over 20 years of research that can actually stimulate stem cell production as fast as water-only fasting can do it.
[03:02:58.820 --> 03:03:03.004]  And according to USC, in 72 hours, you can regenerate your entire immune system.
[03:03:03.644 --> 03:03:05.546]  And it reboots itself.
[03:03:05.546 --> 03:03:08.368]  So, I mean, think about that.
[03:03:08.368 --> 03:03:19.937]  You can go overseas to Thailand and get a $120,000 stem cell treatment, or maybe a $50,000 stem cell treatment, or you can do it for $1.99 a day with spring water or distilled water.
[03:03:19.937 --> 03:03:20.838]  And let me be clear.
[03:03:20.838 --> 03:03:23.580]  And do a water fast and regenerate your organs.
[03:03:23.580 --> 03:03:24.201]  Let me be clear.
[03:03:25.373 --> 03:03:38.066]  There's hundreds and hundreds of studies just on bio-PQQ alone that's in DNA Force that we're allowed to talk about because it's so powerful, but it regenerates nerves in some cases, so an area that was dead, like your knee, your back, it may come back.
[03:03:38.066 --> 03:03:39.207]  It may hurt worse for a while.
[03:03:39.207 --> 03:03:42.790]  I had a finger that was chopped off and was still numb up on the front.
[03:03:42.790 --> 03:03:44.292]  I took DNA Force after a few months.
[03:03:44.292 --> 03:03:45.813]  It came back, sort of tingling.
[03:03:45.813 --> 03:03:46.814]  The feeling is back.
[03:03:48.236 --> 03:03:56.721]  So, I mean, you can actually say that and it detoxifies the cells, so it doesn't grow telomeres, it keeps them from shrinking as fast, correct?
[03:03:56.721 --> 03:04:12.531]  Yes, and I mean, the cleaner your body is and the more you detoxify and the healthier you become on a daily basis, the better your body is at producing stem cells because your body has to eliminate pounds, literally pounds of dead cells every single day.
[03:04:12.671 --> 03:04:14.954]  Danny, you've got to try DNA Force for yourself.
[03:04:14.954 --> 03:04:17.216]  As Dr. Group said, the fasting is amazing.
[03:04:17.216 --> 03:04:18.298]  Each person is different.
[03:04:18.298 --> 03:04:19.499]  So consult your physician.
[03:04:19.499 --> 03:04:20.220]  Do your own research.
[03:04:20.220 --> 03:04:22.843]  But you did like the other products?
[03:04:22.843 --> 03:04:23.984]  Oh, they're incredible.
[03:04:23.984 --> 03:04:25.266]  They're incredible.
[03:04:25.266 --> 03:04:32.635]  And I'd like to ask you if you could make the bone broth unflavored because for some reason the flavoring bothered me.
[03:04:33.817 --> 03:04:37.099]  You know, we got a lot of requests for a flavor-free, not strawberry and chocolate, bone broth.
[03:04:37.099 --> 03:04:37.499]  And you know what?
[03:04:37.499 --> 03:04:38.600]  We'll do that for you.
[03:04:38.600 --> 03:04:39.620]  We're gonna work on that, Danny.
[03:04:39.620 --> 03:04:40.701]  Thank you so much.
[03:04:40.701 --> 03:04:44.383]  Alright, Noel, Al, Michael, others, we're going right to your calls on the other side.
[03:04:44.383 --> 03:04:45.423]  Kevin in Florida as well.
[03:04:45.423 --> 03:04:46.324]  Stay with us.
[03:04:46.324 --> 03:04:48.085]  And Roger Stone's coming on with the latest.
[03:04:53.564 --> 03:04:57.950]  You go to InfoWarsTore.com and get game-changing, amazing products.
[03:04:57.950 --> 03:05:01.735]  We've been sold out of DNA Force for almost four months.
[03:05:01.735 --> 03:05:04.439]  These ingredients are nutraceutical grade.
[03:05:04.439 --> 03:05:07.283]  You have the highest quality, the bio-PQQ, all of it.
[03:05:07.283 --> 03:05:07.503]  It's 25% off.
[03:05:08.424 --> 03:05:08.904]  I'm good.
[03:05:25.578 --> 03:05:29.742]  Out of the gates, back in stock, but for a very limited time.
[03:05:29.742 --> 03:05:32.284]  So you get the highest quality, the very cleanest stuff out there.
[03:05:32.284 --> 03:05:33.685]  We're really, really proud of it.
[03:05:33.685 --> 03:05:35.567]  DNA Force and Bomb Defense.
[03:05:35.567 --> 03:05:36.108]  Probiotic.
[03:05:36.108 --> 03:05:36.968]  Now back in stock.
[03:05:36.968 --> 03:05:38.109]  Infowarslife.com.
[03:05:38.109 --> 03:05:41.953]  And when you buy products from Globalist, it's an act of trading with the enemy.
[03:05:41.953 --> 03:05:42.714]  It is an act of war.
[03:05:42.714 --> 03:05:45.136]  It is an act of standing up.
[03:05:45.136 --> 03:05:50.701]  When you spread the links, the articles, and buy products from us, and then we commit to rampage against the enemy totally.
[03:06:09.602 --> 03:06:14.585]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[03:06:14.585 --> 03:06:19.288]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[03:06:36.810 --> 03:06:40.354]  Next year's news today, that's InfoWars.
[03:06:40.354 --> 03:06:48.462]  Don't need a time machine, just need common sense to study the globalists and their architecture, their program, their operation, to know what they're gonna do next.
[03:06:48.462 --> 03:06:50.304]  That's how they ask, how do you know all this classified information?
[03:06:50.304 --> 03:06:52.286]  How do you know all these secrets?
[03:06:52.286 --> 03:06:52.607]  Because...
[03:06:54.468 --> 03:07:14.260]  We do the research, and then we already know what's going on, and then people that are in corporations, high-level intelligence operations, tune into us, because they know we know what we're talking about, and then we get information from them, and it's a symbiotic symbiosis, and why do you think we have, why do you think we have next year's news today?
[03:07:16.704 --> 03:07:18.467]  Because you figure it out.
[03:07:18.467 --> 03:07:29.001]  I mean you figure it out and you have connections and you have the people that there are people out there that want to whistleblow and that want to expose and want to tell the truth and it's all about
[03:07:29.960 --> 03:07:34.582]  People that have this information, that want to share this information and get the truth out there.
[03:07:34.582 --> 03:07:47.289]  And that's why there's such a war to suppress the truth and suppress the people that are telling the truth and to try to prevent the next Alex Jones or the next person that's actually going to expose this information.
[03:07:47.289 --> 03:07:47.890]  I love that.
[03:07:47.890 --> 03:07:50.131]  Next year's news today because it's so true.
[03:07:50.831 --> 03:07:57.155]  It's, you know, you get the information as fast as we get the information.
[03:07:57.155 --> 03:07:59.437]  And we get information every single day.
[03:07:59.437 --> 03:08:01.578]  And now you're starting to see it in mainstream news.
[03:08:01.578 --> 03:08:03.839]  Look at CNN reporting on the fluoride.
[03:08:03.839 --> 03:08:06.601]  I mean, I have all kinds of documentation support, you know, here.
[03:08:06.601 --> 03:08:12.345]  Why do you think CNN's come out now and admitted that fluoride causes massive brain damage?
[03:08:16.289 --> 03:08:17.870]  I don't know why they came out.
[03:08:17.870 --> 03:08:26.295]  I mean, I think to a certain degree they're losing a lot of viewership and they're, because they're not reporting on the truth and they probably have, they are fake news.
[03:08:26.295 --> 03:08:29.857]  I mean, and people are starting to realize that, hopefully.
[03:08:29.857 --> 03:08:41.864]  I mean, I know there's the CNN, you know, lifers and everything like that, but I mean, come on, some of the stuff is just so far out, people are waking up and the consciousness is rising.
[03:08:41.864 --> 03:08:43.044]  Some people are waking up.
[03:08:43.044 --> 03:08:43.605]  Other folks,
[03:08:44.105 --> 03:08:48.551]  Even though they're somewhat awake, they're on phones and computers so much, that it's all just more data.
[03:08:48.551 --> 03:08:52.937]  So if you say, hey, this is important, this is going on, it's not like it's real.
[03:08:52.937 --> 03:08:54.800]  They don't then follow through is what I've noticed.
[03:08:56.260 --> 03:09:02.242]  And it's something that just absolutely, you know, is a plague on those of us that are trying to get people to actually wake up.
[03:09:02.242 --> 03:09:04.763]  Roger Stone's riding a shotgun with us for the hour.
[03:09:04.763 --> 03:09:09.864]  He's going to be hosting another hour of The War Room with Owen Schroyer, coming up in about 51 minutes.
[03:09:09.864 --> 03:09:14.206]  And I want to go to Michael, Noel, Al, and Kevin, then we're going to punch out of here and let Roger take over.
[03:09:14.206 --> 03:09:14.686]  But Roger.
[03:09:15.086 --> 03:09:22.154]  We're going to have a bunch of compilation videos we haven't gotten to yet of the media crying on the night of the election, whining, and then calling for violence.
[03:09:22.154 --> 03:09:34.847]  We're also sending Millie Weaver and Gavin Wince down to the demonstration where hundreds of people said they're going to show up, just scream at the sky is what it's called, and just act like complete maniacs.
[03:09:34.847 --> 03:09:36.529]  What is going on with the left here?
[03:09:37.466 --> 03:10:04.454]  First of all, I'm toasting the first anniversary, as so many others are, of the historic achievement of Donald J. Trump, the most improbable upset in American political history, in celebrating great memories of that night, but also pointing out that you, like he, when he said, look, we may have won the election, he said that night, but the fight is just beginning.
[03:10:05.474 --> 03:10:27.049]  Little did we know how right he was, and you were among the few who anticipated the extraordinary efforts by the left to disenfranchise him, to undermine his, destabilize his presidency, and so on, in the spasm of their epic loss.
[03:10:28.146 --> 03:10:35.733]  So, and the fight goes on, but it is really, it's a signal of an American renaissance.
[03:10:35.733 --> 03:10:43.962]  It's when the American people finally rose up and said to the two-party duopoly, enough of your crap.
[03:10:45.311 --> 03:10:47.792]  You know, they're tired of endless war.
[03:10:47.792 --> 03:10:50.633]  They're tired of the erosion of our civil liberties.
[03:10:50.633 --> 03:10:56.676]  They're tired of the billions of dollars of debt and borrowing that they load on our shoulders.
[03:10:56.676 --> 03:11:02.979]  They're tired of immigration policies that leave their neighborhoods unsafe and their streets unsafe.
[03:11:02.979 --> 03:11:11.983]  They're tired of trade policies that have given the jobs to foreign nations and sucked the jobs out of America.
[03:11:12.543 --> 03:11:21.990]  And then we've got the big Googles and Facebooks and Twitters last week, and a video we'll play coming up later in the hour that's extraordinary, saying, we censored InfoWars at lunch.
[03:11:21.990 --> 03:11:26.413]  Because Congressman Quigley goes, I saw InfoWars was number one on the suicide attack.
[03:11:26.413 --> 03:11:27.054]  They wouldn't even say that.
[03:11:27.054 --> 03:11:29.015]  They said there was no attack in New York.
[03:11:29.015 --> 03:11:29.755]  Jones is fake.
[03:11:29.755 --> 03:11:32.177]  de Blasio isn't soft on terror.
[03:11:32.177 --> 03:11:33.178]  And they actually say this.
[03:11:33.178 --> 03:11:33.938]  It's crazy.
[03:11:33.938 --> 03:11:35.039]  And they go, yes, sir, we know.
[03:11:35.039 --> 03:11:36.020]  We banned it.
[03:11:36.020 --> 03:11:36.981]  We blocked InfoWars.
[03:11:36.981 --> 03:11:38.422]  Now it's a USA Today story, sir.
[03:11:39.142 --> 03:11:44.905]  In live time, they're just admitting like they robbed a bank culturally, that they're doing this in live time.
[03:11:44.905 --> 03:11:48.566]  It is just absolutely insane.
[03:11:48.566 --> 03:11:53.308]  And so now they want to block the AT&T-Time Warner merger, which is fine with me.
[03:11:53.308 --> 03:11:57.510]  Trump's getting an anti-trust guy in at the Federal Trade Commission.
[03:11:57.510 --> 03:12:03.473]  But what about Google and all these folks that are monopolies and then use it to literally screw over the First Amendment?
[03:12:04.215 --> 03:12:05.876]  I've got to be honest with you, Alex.
[03:12:05.876 --> 03:12:09.757]  I'm in favor of the AT&T-Time Warner merger.
[03:12:09.757 --> 03:12:15.160]  I really think the arguments against it from a technical and legal point of view are incorrect.
[03:12:15.160 --> 03:12:15.880]  No, I know what it is.
[03:12:15.880 --> 03:12:20.642]  They want the same power Google has to operate and bring competition.
[03:12:20.642 --> 03:12:21.322]  Google doesn't want it.
[03:12:21.322 --> 03:12:22.043]  That's what I'm saying.
[03:12:22.043 --> 03:12:22.863]  They're the monopoly.
[03:12:22.863 --> 03:12:24.164]  They're the new dominant group.
[03:12:24.164 --> 03:12:25.684]  Why don't they get their nose bloody?
[03:12:25.684 --> 03:12:27.265]  Why doesn't Trump hammer their ass?
[03:12:27.705 --> 03:12:30.006]  Well, here's why I think it's significant, however.
[03:12:30.006 --> 03:12:40.010]  Perhaps the new management that AT&T puts at Time Warner would look at their owned assets, CNN, and make some leadership changes there.
[03:12:40.010 --> 03:12:46.473]  Maybe they should take that back to being a journalistic venture as opposed to a left-wing propaganda front.
[03:12:47.173 --> 03:13:01.043]  I think they should dismiss Mr. Zucker and he would probably, you know, show Jake Tapper and Don Lemon and Anna Navarro and the other brainiacs there the door.
[03:13:01.043 --> 03:13:15.292]  So, in a sense, I would like to see the merger go through if for no other reason, for the selfish reason of cleaning up the most vicious, violent, vituperative, false attacks on our president.
[03:13:16.953 --> 03:13:20.617]  They're so discredited, it's almost good to keep them there like Hillary, but I agree.
[03:13:20.617 --> 03:13:21.898]  Justice be done, may the heavens fall.
[03:13:21.898 --> 03:13:27.042]  Noel, in the great city of Chicago, Noel wants to talk about year in review for Trump.
[03:13:27.042 --> 03:13:28.404]  What's your report card?
[03:13:28.404 --> 03:13:31.366]  I'd give him an A plus for effort.
[03:13:31.366 --> 03:13:34.369]  I'd say on delivery about a B, but man, I tell you, he's gotten better.
[03:13:34.369 --> 03:13:35.450]  He's gotten better than I thought.
[03:13:35.450 --> 03:13:36.031]  What do you think, Noel?
[03:13:37.561 --> 03:13:45.425]  Um, geez, in terms of a grade, you're putting me on the spot there, Mr. Jones, but I'd have to say, I'd say B-.
[03:13:45.425 --> 03:13:48.107]  A for effort, yes.
[03:13:48.107 --> 03:14:01.534]  A little concerned about the swamp factor of the District of Columbia, but overall in terms of trying to build back America on the world stage, he's doing a quite good job with other world leaders.
[03:14:01.534 --> 03:14:03.875]  But Mr. Jones and Roger Stone,
[03:14:04.375 --> 03:14:13.846]  Quite fascinating to see a tale of two debates and the media perception of then candidate Trump at the bowels of the
[03:14:15.129 --> 03:14:31.755]  The casino basement of the Venetian Hotel after one of the debates in December, the Republican debates, and most of the corporate media hacks thought, and this is when I worked in Wyoming at the time, all the corporate media hacks thought that Trump's campaign was a joke.
[03:14:31.755 --> 03:14:33.295]  No shot of winning.
[03:14:33.295 --> 03:14:35.156]  They wanted Jeb Bush to speak.
[03:14:35.156 --> 03:14:39.157]  They all thought Jeb was going to bounce back and Scott Walker this and yada yada yada.
[03:14:39.517 --> 03:14:49.562]  But yes, at the end of the night, Trump was the last person of all the other morons that were candidates at the time, was the last one to speak to every media outlet that was there.
[03:14:49.562 --> 03:14:54.564]  And I saw it with my own two eyes, and I thought at the end of the night, boy, Trump really does have a chance of winning.
[03:14:54.684 --> 03:15:12.059]  I was about to say, just the stamina and the entitlement of them trying to force-feed Jeb with him with 5% rates in the early part of the election and still most of the money being given to them, just like they tried to force-feed Hillary, it shows their Marie Antoinette-level disconnect.
[03:15:12.059 --> 03:15:13.961]  Great point, Noel Rogerstone.
[03:15:13.961 --> 03:15:21.387]  Well, in that period, I think it's important to point out, Alex, the most dangerous place on the face of the planet would be between Donald Trump and a television camera.
[03:15:22.492 --> 03:15:24.853]  I mean, he is a master of the media.
[03:15:24.853 --> 03:15:34.698]  He knows the media that they're giving him is worth literally millions, including the coverage here at InfoWars, and he plays to it like Stradivarius.
[03:15:34.698 --> 03:15:39.740]  And now the Wahhabists are getting their butt handed to them for Vegas, and a lot of big things are happening.
[03:15:39.740 --> 03:15:40.401]  Noelle, thank you.
[03:15:40.401 --> 03:15:42.222]  Michael, Kevin and others, straight ahead.
[03:15:42.222 --> 03:15:47.844]  And Roger Stone takes over the quarterback out of the InfoWars, right into the war room with Owen Schroer.

[03:20:26.473 --> 03:20:28.275]  He'll be going into the war room.
[03:20:29.781 --> 03:20:31.782]  We're on 34 hours live here.
[03:20:31.782 --> 03:20:33.123]  We're like seven and a half hours in.

[03:20:38.766 --> 03:20:42.968]  You want to be watching the live feed tonight?
[03:20:42.968 --> 03:20:47.030]  No, not for me doing an hour of Ask Me Anything Reddit at 8 o'clock.
[03:20:47.030 --> 03:20:49.211]  Yes, I'm going to do that at 8 o'clock tonight, Central.
[03:20:49.211 --> 03:20:51.773]  That's going to be good, but we've got some really good stuff coming.
[03:20:52.493 --> 03:20:52.994]  Uh, for you.
[03:20:52.994 --> 03:20:57.679]  Trying to get your phone calls right now so Roger Strong can take over and get to all the meat and potatoes he's got.
[03:20:57.679 --> 03:21:02.325]  But Dr. Group, sitting here with me, look at this new article.
[03:21:02.325 --> 03:21:05.709]  Dems win in Dem states that voted Dem in 2016.
[03:21:05.709 --> 03:21:07.771]  Kit Daniels, strange.
[03:21:07.771 --> 03:21:09.834]  MSM claims it's a setback for Trump.
[03:21:11.303 --> 03:21:13.885]  As Dems sweep blue states.
[03:21:13.885 --> 03:21:15.887]  Again, you and I, we're not even Republicans.
[03:21:15.887 --> 03:21:19.830]  We just see a real rebellion with Trump, a global rebellion happening.
[03:21:19.830 --> 03:21:23.573]  Why do you think everywhere globalists are being kicked out of office?
[03:21:23.573 --> 03:21:26.416]  I mean, every week countries are removing globalists.
[03:21:26.416 --> 03:21:30.019]  And then prosperity just comes in like day following night.
[03:21:32.352 --> 03:21:47.245]  Well, again, I think that people are waking up because of, you know, everything that you've been doing and everything that all the other alternative media has been doing, and people are... I mean, look, like you said, you can find on The Hill, you can find in Reuters, you can find in...
[03:21:49.046 --> 03:21:57.170]  CNN, I mean, even all the mainstream media are starting to report the same exact things that we've been reporting on for a long time.
[03:21:57.170 --> 03:22:00.451]  I mean, how do you have all the illegals that are coming out?
[03:22:00.451 --> 03:22:07.734]  I mean, how do you, you know, all of this stuff that's coming out is coming out in little tiny pieces so people can actually digest it.
[03:22:07.734 --> 03:22:11.336]  And the more little tiny pieces that are coming out over and over again,
[03:22:12.316 --> 03:22:23.388]  That's conditioning, but this is more or less conditioning in a good way, because these are all things that the lies of the mainstream media are being exposed.
[03:22:23.388 --> 03:22:25.070]  Oh, there was not any illegal.
[03:22:25.070 --> 03:22:28.033]  There was maybe 250,000 illegals that voted.
[03:22:28.033 --> 03:22:30.736]  Oh, now, later on, oh, it's confirmed by Harvard.
[03:22:30.736 --> 03:22:32.918]  There was over a million illegals.
[03:22:32.918 --> 03:22:33.839]  You know, all of these
[03:22:34.887 --> 03:22:39.051]  These different elections, people are coming out and they're saying, we want change, okay?
[03:22:39.051 --> 03:22:53.345]  We are pretty much living in a designed socialist republic, and the only thing left to where we're not pretty much under a Nazi-style regime is the fact that we still have our guns!
[03:22:53.345 --> 03:22:58.410]  That's right, and now what's happened is, it's like the Truman Show, he discovers that
[03:22:59.111 --> 03:23:03.815]  It's a matrix, and there's this whole ruling class that knows they're engineering us.
[03:23:03.815 --> 03:23:05.597]  You know, Roger, and we're going to go to calls.
[03:23:05.597 --> 03:23:15.446]  That's what's so fascinating about the election process was the WikiLeaks coming out and all the other documents, and now that's made it safe for other whistleblowers to come out and to see the Democrats going.
[03:23:15.446 --> 03:23:17.748]  We've got to keep them desperate and poor.
[03:23:18.448 --> 03:23:21.670]  They're starting to wake up, let's use culture war to control them.
[03:23:21.670 --> 03:23:31.255]  I mean, they're like scientists messing with guinea pigs, cold-bloodedly, like a bunch of sociopathic vampires or something.
[03:23:31.255 --> 03:23:44.122]  What we've got to do is go back and look at Julian Assange's incredible interview where he is asked several times whether the murdered Seth Rich is a source of WikiLeaks, and he's very skillful.
[03:23:44.122 --> 03:23:46.844]  He says, our sources are under great physical danger.
[03:23:47.344 --> 03:24:02.047]  We don't confirm who our sources are, but let me stress, yes, they risk their lives, and oh, by the way, I, Julian Assange, am posting a $25,000 reward for information that leads to the apprehension of Seth Rich's killers.
[03:24:02.648 --> 03:24:08.711]  Now comes Donna Brazile, who, believe me, this book is a bombshell.
[03:24:08.711 --> 03:24:15.814]  The mainstream media is trying to ignore her confirmation of things that we reported here at InfoWars.
[03:24:15.814 --> 03:24:25.298]  First, now you have a true Democrat insider saying everything we said about the Clintons, the stealing from Bernie, indeed the murder of Seth Rich.
[03:24:25.298 --> 03:24:26.118]  It's all true.
[03:24:26.118 --> 03:24:30.160]  And the stealing of the money and the blocking of the hacking, not letting the FBI in.
[03:24:30.740 --> 03:24:32.923]  I mean, she's exposing a lot of criminal activity.
[03:24:32.923 --> 03:24:35.187]  I think she did it not to sell a book.
[03:24:35.187 --> 03:24:38.312]  I mean, she called it Hillary's high command stealing the money.
[03:24:38.312 --> 03:24:39.954]  She's doing it, I think, to protect herself.
[03:24:40.666 --> 03:24:57.475]  Well, not only that, but it comes down at the exact same time that William Binney, who is the foremost counterintelligence person, who has been the most, I think, authoritative critic of the idea that the Russians hacked the DNC.
[03:24:57.475 --> 03:25:00.137]  It has a very science, hard science-based
[03:25:00.897 --> 03:25:11.801]  A case why that is wrong met with the CIA director at President Donald Trump's suggestion, which is certainly a step in the right direction.
[03:25:11.801 --> 03:25:27.986]  The point, of course, is that the evidence mostly shows that the if there was a download of information, it was to a portable hard drive and out the back door, most likely, by the way, by a fellow named Seth Rich.
[03:25:28.146 --> 03:25:30.551]  And now he got executed, so let's go there next.
[03:25:30.551 --> 03:25:38.045]  As our credibility goes megastratospheric, and the mainstream media becomes a laughing stock, what's the next shoe to drop, Roger Stone?
[03:25:38.612 --> 03:25:47.399]  Well, Alex, I think it's important to recognize that they really want to silence us here at InfoWars.
[03:25:47.399 --> 03:25:52.263]  And this new expansion, when I was in Austin last week, I walked through the new studios.
[03:25:52.263 --> 03:25:56.447]  They are going to be state-of-the-art, like no one has ever seen.
[03:25:56.447 --> 03:25:58.449]  By the way, they've been videotaping the building for days.
[03:25:58.449 --> 03:25:59.810]  Do we have any footage of that?
[03:25:59.810 --> 03:26:01.011]  Because today would be the day to air that.
[03:26:02.660 --> 03:26:12.866]  Well, it's possible that somebody trailed me there to your secret location, even though everybody in the car was blindfolded but my driver.
[03:26:12.866 --> 03:26:14.347]  Just kidding.
[03:26:14.347 --> 03:26:17.688]  And the best barbecue on the face of the planet, right nearby there.
[03:26:17.688 --> 03:26:18.209]  In any event,
[03:26:19.910 --> 03:26:30.782]  There is no question that the entire Donna Brazile narrative has shaken the power structure to its knees.
[03:26:30.782 --> 03:26:33.565]  I mean, this Brazile thing is almost as big as the WikiLeaks.
[03:26:35.169 --> 03:26:41.111]  Oh, there's no question because it reaffirms so much of what Assange published has been true.
[03:26:41.111 --> 03:26:47.733]  Look, the government's narrative that Assange is a Russian asset is the greatest hoax of all time.
[03:26:47.733 --> 03:26:48.713]  He's a journalist.
[03:26:48.713 --> 03:26:51.434]  He does what we do here at InfoWars.
[03:26:51.434 --> 03:26:55.635]  He is known for the authenticity and the accuracy of his reporting.
[03:26:55.635 --> 03:27:03.317]  Never once has he ever been challenged for fabricating or producing something that wasn't 100% legitimate and therefore accurate.
[03:27:03.837 --> 03:27:05.879]  The New York Times cannot say that.
[03:27:05.879 --> 03:27:08.322]  The Washington Post cannot say that.
[03:27:08.322 --> 03:27:18.572]  I was very proud last week when on his Twitter feed he was among those who objected to the fact that I have been banned for life by the Twitter.
[03:27:18.572 --> 03:27:20.394]  And by the way, you're going to file suit on that.
[03:27:20.394 --> 03:27:23.097]  I'm going to play a video when we come back and then go to these calls.
[03:27:23.097 --> 03:27:26.080]  But Roger, have you seen the congressional hearings where they literally admit
[03:27:27.547 --> 03:27:33.573]  Congressman Wigley, I'm not joking, that's his name, says, have you seen that InfoWars has the top story?
[03:27:33.573 --> 03:27:35.414]  He goes, sir, we banned it at lunch.
[03:27:35.414 --> 03:27:36.355]  He goes, good.
[03:27:36.355 --> 03:27:36.935]  How do we ban it?
[03:27:36.935 --> 03:27:38.617]  He goes, well, we're getting AI computers, sir.
[03:27:38.617 --> 03:27:40.779]  We'll ban them permanently, sir.
[03:27:40.779 --> 03:27:41.940]  He's like, good, good job.
[03:27:41.940 --> 03:27:45.022]  I mean, it's like watching a Soviet meeting on TV.
[03:27:45.663 --> 03:27:51.731]  Well, then they had the other senator that said, well, you're going to weaponize and got your back on that, too.
[03:27:51.731 --> 03:27:53.553]  Sure, he said, I've looked at this report.
[03:27:53.553 --> 03:27:54.935]  There was a truck attack.
[03:27:54.935 --> 03:27:57.338]  The imam did warn Bellazio.
[03:27:57.338 --> 03:27:59.220]  Bellazio, whatever, Bumbo.
[03:27:59.220 --> 03:28:00.602]  What's the mayor of New York's name?
[03:28:01.809 --> 03:28:03.550]  De Blasio, Bumbo, whatever.
[03:28:03.550 --> 03:28:05.552]  I mean, this happened!
[03:28:05.552 --> 03:28:13.257]  That's what's crazy, Roger, is they say we're publishing fake news when we say the sky's blue, the sun's yellow, and birds have wings!
[03:28:13.257 --> 03:28:25.205]  Yeah, in all honesty, I think that that video, that stunning video, shows that they willfully violated your First Amendment rights is probably the basis for an extraordinary free speech lawsuit.
[03:28:25.305 --> 03:28:32.927]  And we have the Project Veritas with the YouTube officials at the New York Times liaison saying, our main mission is to ban InfoWars.
[03:28:32.927 --> 03:28:37.448]  Get you guys in court!
[03:28:37.448 --> 03:28:42.629]  I know, we're gearing up, but I mean, I'm not a litigious person, but the lawyers are just licking their lips on these.
[03:28:42.629 --> 03:28:44.889]  I mean, the problem is two, three year fights.
[03:28:44.889 --> 03:28:48.290]  And yeah, we're going to, we'll be right back.
[03:28:48.290 --> 03:28:48.690]  Stay with us.
[03:28:48.690 --> 03:28:50.250]  We're going to play that clip coming out of you.
[03:28:50.250 --> 03:28:50.811]  Missed it.
[03:28:50.811 --> 03:28:51.431]  Stay there callers.
[03:28:51.431 --> 03:28:52.931]  We're going to go to you.
[03:28:54.537 --> 03:28:55.998]  Hello, Mr. Anderson.
[03:28:55.998 --> 03:28:59.759]  The NSA has noticed how much time you spend on conservative news sites.
[03:28:59.759 --> 03:29:03.561]  We have no choice but to consider you a domestic terrorist.

[03:29:25.396 --> 03:29:33.442]  You need a water filter that removes chlorine, fluoride, pharmaceuticals, BPA and other endocrine disruptors, pesticides, bacteria, viruses and much more, right?

[03:29:54.150 --> 03:29:57.293]  America is an information-based civil war.
[03:29:57.293 --> 03:30:04.722]  That's why now, more than ever, we've got to hit the streets of America and let these globalist scum know we're not backing down from their bullying.
[03:30:04.722 --> 03:30:10.328]  We're only intensifying our operations in the face of their wannabe dictatorship.
[03:30:11.068 --> 03:30:18.752]  Being a conservative, a nationalist, a libertarian, or simply a free speech advocate is truly the counterculture.
[03:30:18.752 --> 03:30:26.676]  The real punk rock is being a patriot who's pro-America, pro-capitalism, and pro-freedom, who at the same time is tolerant.
[03:30:27.356 --> 03:30:32.420]  Modern liberalism is a counterfeit of Thomas Jefferson's classical liberalism.
[03:30:32.420 --> 03:30:34.542]  They are the anti-liberals.
[03:30:34.542 --> 03:30:47.932]  To defend free speech, meet like-minded friends, and promote freedom worldwide, we've got more than 60 original designs of high-quality t-shirts for men and women, as well as more patriot apparel at InfoWarsTore.com.

[03:32:31.984 --> 03:32:33.385]  We're really, really proud of it.
[03:32:33.385 --> 03:32:35.266]  DNA Force and Bomb Defense.
[03:32:35.266 --> 03:32:35.786]  Probiotic.
[03:32:35.786 --> 03:32:36.666]  Now back in stock.
[03:32:36.666 --> 03:32:37.807]  Infowarslife.com.
[03:32:37.807 --> 03:32:41.649]  And when you buy products from Globalist, it's an act of trading with the enemy.
[03:32:41.649 --> 03:32:42.770]  It is an act of war.
[03:32:42.770 --> 03:32:44.831]  It is an act of standing up.
[03:32:44.831 --> 03:32:50.394]  When you spread the links, the articles, and buy products from us, and then we commit to rampage against the enemy totally.
[03:32:55.638 --> 03:32:58.270]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[03:33:18.121 --> 03:33:24.845]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center in the heart of the resistance.
[03:33:24.845 --> 03:33:27.887]  It's Alex Jones.
[03:33:27.887 --> 03:33:33.270]  I'm going to be a good boy and go to your calls with Roger Stone here in just a few minutes, but this is critical.
[03:33:33.270 --> 03:33:35.671]  It's not about, oh, we're number one, oh, they're attacking us.
[03:33:35.671 --> 03:33:37.633]  It's why are they attacking us?
[03:33:37.633 --> 03:33:39.113]  Because we're on target.
[03:33:39.113 --> 03:33:40.794]  We've studied their own documents.
[03:33:40.794 --> 03:33:44.697]  They were so arrogant, they thought no one would study their blueprints and expose it.
[03:33:45.762 --> 03:33:52.232]  And then by osmosis, basically, we built it, you came, because people want to be free, we want to oppose authoritarianism.
[03:33:54.153 --> 03:33:58.135]  The globalists call me a chump because I don't want to join them and screw people over.
[03:33:58.135 --> 03:34:00.076]  And what, build a planet of BS?
[03:34:00.076 --> 03:34:01.237]  We've got enough problems.
[03:34:01.237 --> 03:34:03.578]  If we were good, we might blow ourselves up.
[03:34:03.578 --> 03:34:05.799]  If we're bad, we have no future.
[03:34:05.799 --> 03:34:07.460]  So again, I'm a selfish person.
[03:34:07.460 --> 03:34:10.021]  I feel a connection to everybody and the future.
[03:34:10.021 --> 03:34:12.002]  And I want my progeny to go to the stars.
[03:34:12.002 --> 03:34:16.545]  I want to be a winning species, not a species screwing each other over.
[03:34:16.545 --> 03:34:18.506]  But then you watch these people attacking us.
[03:34:19.306 --> 03:34:28.876]  For saying that an islamicist had killed people in a truck last week and that de Blasio had been warned by a famous imam who did it in person and on Fox News!
[03:34:28.876 --> 03:34:30.337]  We were reporting like saying...
[03:34:31.636 --> 03:34:41.403]  Fire hydrants are red, or Roger Stone's wearing a blue tie, or, you know, I've got a big head, I mean, or is it Nancy Pelosi can hardly talk?
[03:34:41.403 --> 03:34:47.748]  I mean, it's so crazy what they picked to call fake news, because they're still saying, it's fake news.
[03:34:47.748 --> 03:34:52.172]  Jones is claiming that we stole the nomination from Bernie.
[03:34:52.172 --> 03:34:54.934]  Jones is claiming that illegals voted.
[03:34:54.934 --> 03:34:58.256]  They said that in the hearing, that I made that up!
[03:34:58.256 --> 03:34:58.957]  So, here it is.
[03:35:00.046 --> 03:35:05.017]  Let's look at unpaid content for a second.
[03:35:05.017 --> 03:35:08.744]  Sometimes these fake accounts are pulled down, but the fake story...
[03:35:10.353 --> 03:35:20.899]  Takes the false claims of widespread voter fraud, for example, generated by these accounts have spread thousands and thousands of times, often picked up by legitimate news accounts.
[03:35:20.899 --> 03:35:22.700]  What do you do to flag that?
[03:35:22.700 --> 03:35:25.201]  What do you sense is your responsibility?
[03:35:25.201 --> 03:35:32.586]  Before any of you answer, let me just notice this, that if we're asking is, are we still in this situation?
[03:35:33.424 --> 03:35:34.806]  Hey, this is the long clip.
[03:35:34.806 --> 03:35:35.507]  This is the long clip.
[03:35:35.507 --> 03:35:40.975]  We're going to kill this clip and we're going to go to the one that we put together today with Project Veritas.
[03:35:40.975 --> 03:35:47.425]  Introducing, ladies and gentlemen, here is the clip of where Veritas is pointing out in the Google videos, all of it internally.
[03:35:47.425 --> 03:35:48.767]  Their target is now in Congress.
[03:35:48.767 --> 03:35:49.067]  Here it is.
[03:35:49.804 --> 03:35:52.026]  We confirm suspicions at Veritas.
[03:35:52.026 --> 03:35:58.650]  It's not a shock to you, but to get the employee at YouTube on tape admitting that they do it?
[03:35:58.650 --> 03:36:01.572]  I mean, you must be a threat if they call you out by name.
[03:36:01.572 --> 03:36:05.855]  It's also what happens when you listen to the radio host Alex Jones.
[03:36:06.275 --> 03:36:30.020]  As of just a short time ago, and I'm talking about when this meeting started, on Twitter, if you clicked on the hashtag, NYC Terrorist Attack, which is, quote, trending, marked with a red button saying, quote, live, the top tweet links to an InfoWars story with the headline, Imam, I warned de Blasio about New York City terror.
[03:36:30.020 --> 03:36:31.680]  He was too busy bashing Trump.
[03:36:31.900 --> 03:36:38.433]  I don't know what happens in somebody's mind or how dark their heart must be.
[03:36:40.450 --> 03:36:42.091]  To say things like that.
[03:36:42.091 --> 03:36:49.457]  This is a real-time example of when we talk about this information being weaponized.
[03:36:49.457 --> 03:36:52.119]  But Trump doesn't challenge these lies.
[03:36:52.119 --> 03:36:57.183]  He actually went on Jones' show and said... Your reputation's amazing.
[03:36:57.183 --> 03:36:58.664]  I will not let you down.
[03:36:58.664 --> 03:37:01.987]  You will be very, very impressed, I hope.
[03:37:01.987 --> 03:37:09.512]  How quickly can you act and what's your responsibility to set the record straight so that the people who saw this
[03:37:10.814 --> 03:37:18.436]  Know that it's fake news, and at least at some point in time, it can't keep spreading like some sort of virus through the legitimate world.
[03:37:18.436 --> 03:37:25.478]  That's something we're thinking about all the time, because it's a bad user experience, and we don't want to be known as a platform for that.
[03:37:25.478 --> 03:37:35.720]  You have RT, you have Sputnik, you have Ruppli, and then I think you have them feeding other entities.
[03:37:35.720 --> 03:37:38.241]  InfoWars comes to mind, where those are echo chambers.
[03:37:38.601 --> 03:37:39.821]  The system self-corrected.
[03:37:39.821 --> 03:37:42.702]  That shouldn't be the first tweet you see anymore.
[03:37:42.702 --> 03:37:46.123]  It should be a USA article the last time I checked.
[03:37:46.123 --> 03:37:47.343]  But you saw this?
[03:37:47.343 --> 03:37:48.264]  USA Today.
[03:37:48.264 --> 03:37:49.144]  At lunch I did, yeah.
[03:37:49.144 --> 03:37:51.965]  And I also saw the system correct it.
[03:37:51.965 --> 03:37:53.305]  That man's a threat to this country.
[03:37:53.305 --> 03:37:54.926]  They didn't call out Fox News by name.
[03:37:54.926 --> 03:37:56.766]  They didn't call out anyone else by name.
[03:37:56.766 --> 03:37:59.847]  They said, when it comes to Alex Jones, we need people to
[03:38:00.407 --> 03:38:13.356]  Scroll and manually find him and manually have to find that video We're not we're not gonna allow that video if it gets 10 million views to be on the front of the so-called news carousel Alex Jones
[03:38:20.563 --> 03:38:28.068]  Now, in the full piece that's also on InfoWars.com, they say, and he also claims that illegals voted, which we know is fake.
[03:38:28.068 --> 03:38:30.770]  And the heads of Google, Twitter, and Facebook go, yes, we're banning him.
[03:38:30.770 --> 03:38:31.911]  We understand.
[03:38:31.911 --> 03:38:35.033]  Well, they just totally banned for life Roger Stone.
[03:38:35.033 --> 03:38:36.474]  Well, they say they want a good experience.
[03:38:36.474 --> 03:38:43.718]  It's a bunch of leftists threatening to kill and murder the president, threatened to kill Roger Stone, threatening to burn his house down, saying where it is.
[03:38:43.718 --> 03:38:47.801]  Keith Overman foaming at the mouth like a deranged homicidal maniac.
[03:38:47.801 --> 03:38:49.963]  We're all genteely exposing them.
[03:38:50.723 --> 03:38:53.184]  And that's why they're crapping their drawers, Roger.
[03:38:53.184 --> 03:38:55.386]  Alex, look, you're absolutely right.
[03:38:55.386 --> 03:38:57.327]  Look, I've been around politics a long time.
[03:38:57.327 --> 03:38:59.108]  I'm an Italian-American.
[03:38:59.108 --> 03:39:01.869]  And I'm from pretty tough stock.
[03:39:01.869 --> 03:39:11.755]  But when people threaten to, you know, dismember or disfigure my wife, attack my children, when people say, oh, I know where your grandchildren go to school,
[03:39:12.615 --> 03:39:14.936]  Threatened to kill my dogs.
[03:39:14.936 --> 03:39:16.917]  I can't forgive that.
[03:39:16.917 --> 03:39:18.718]  I cannot forget that.
[03:39:18.718 --> 03:39:22.260]  So we're subjected to this torrent of hate.
[03:39:22.260 --> 03:39:38.849]  I know that in certain confines of Austin, you and I can't even go out in public without being accosted by drooling left-wingers who want to spew insults, that we have to move around, unfortunately, with security, which is a sad day for America.
[03:39:39.709 --> 03:39:41.150]  But the left can't.
[03:39:41.150 --> 03:39:44.010]  They have no other answer but shutting us up.
[03:39:44.010 --> 03:39:46.291]  They can't win a debate with Alex Jones.
[03:39:46.291 --> 03:39:49.312]  They can't win a debate with Paul Joseph Watson.
[03:39:49.312 --> 03:39:51.672]  They can't win a debate with Roger Stone.
[03:39:51.672 --> 03:39:52.893]  They don't care to debate.
[03:39:52.893 --> 03:39:56.174]  They just want to silence us.
[03:39:56.174 --> 03:40:04.636]  Frankly, Alex, you're lucky I have time to do the show because my phone is ringing with lawyers who want to represent you in your lawsuit after that
[03:40:05.336 --> 03:40:09.899]  Stunning admission under oath before Congress.
[03:40:09.899 --> 03:40:13.761]  You've got one heck of a lawsuit regarding your First Amendment rights.
[03:40:13.761 --> 03:40:19.925]  They're at lunch saying the head of Twitter, head of operations, yes we banned him at lunch.
[03:40:19.925 --> 03:40:30.432]  I mean my phone is ringing off a hook saying Alex's constitutional rights have just been steamrolled by the federal government and they admitted it under oath.
[03:40:30.432 --> 03:40:32.093]  That's an extraordinary lawsuit.
[03:40:32.093 --> 03:40:34.555]  Why are they so honest about the censorship now?
[03:40:36.058 --> 03:40:50.301]  Well, I think it's because they believe they have put a black hat on us through their, you know, Mockingbird Project-type media stooges, whether it is, uh, uh, Megyn Kelly or whether it is fake Tapper, you know, the drumbeat-o.
[03:40:50.301 --> 03:40:51.462]  Jones is incredible.
[03:40:51.462 --> 03:40:52.562]  Jones is incredible.
[03:40:52.562 --> 03:40:53.882]  Jones is incredible.
[03:40:53.882 --> 03:40:54.882]  Stone is incredible.
[03:40:54.882 --> 03:40:57.703]  When in fact, they're the ones who are not credible.
[03:40:57.703 --> 03:41:05.245]  They're the ones where you do the back of the math, uh, uh, uh, uh, addition and nothing they tell you ever adds up.
[03:41:06.325 --> 03:41:11.786]  By the way, we have to blur out Keith Uberman links on our stories or we could be kicked off our ISPs.
[03:41:11.786 --> 03:41:14.567]  I mean, that's how vicious this stuff is.
[03:41:14.567 --> 03:41:15.727]  Well, and foul-mouthed.
[03:41:15.727 --> 03:41:19.208]  So, look, I use a curse word now and then.
[03:41:19.208 --> 03:41:25.010]  I would admit that my Twitter feed was pungent and pugilistic and pretty blunt.
[03:41:25.010 --> 03:41:27.010]  That's just the way I am, as you know, Alex.
[03:41:27.010 --> 03:41:28.691]  But it was milquetoast compared to Oberman.
[03:41:29.031 --> 03:41:33.993]  Well, just in terms of the obscenity and dropping the F-bomb.
[03:41:33.993 --> 03:41:36.233]  Every other word is the F-bomb.
[03:41:36.233 --> 03:41:38.334]  Attacking the President personally.
[03:41:38.334 --> 03:41:41.855]  I mean, it's just... He does appear to have Tourette's Syndrome.
[03:41:41.855 --> 03:41:42.855]  Well, I don't know.
[03:41:42.855 --> 03:41:49.877]  How do you do the... I don't know how, while wearing a straitjacket, you can type, but somehow this guy tweets.
[03:41:49.877 --> 03:41:50.638]  He's not able to...
[03:41:51.578 --> 03:41:52.238]  Alright, stay there.
[03:41:52.238 --> 03:41:54.099]  I know you've got breaking news, so does Gribble.
[03:41:54.099 --> 03:41:55.040]  I don't want Gribble to jump in here.
[03:41:55.040 --> 03:41:56.701]  You're going to be hosting coming up in a moment.
[03:41:56.701 --> 03:41:57.641]  I'm sorry, callers.
[03:41:57.641 --> 03:42:01.283]  I promise you can kill me, Barry, and James, and Michael, and Kevin.
[03:42:01.283 --> 03:42:04.025]  If I don't get to you, you can all, I guess, kill haul me.
[03:42:04.025 --> 03:42:08.067]  But just briefly, because I've not been plugging hardly any, we've got free shipping store-wide.
[03:42:08.067 --> 03:42:08.868]  We hardly ever do that.
[03:42:09.983 --> 03:42:14.664]  For the celebration of the one-year anniversary of the victory of Trump and the defeat of the globalists.
[03:42:14.664 --> 03:42:15.324]  Are we angels?
[03:42:15.324 --> 03:42:16.865]  No, but we're not out to get you.
[03:42:16.865 --> 03:42:17.825]  The worm has turned.
[03:42:17.825 --> 03:42:19.285]  We're all in this together.
[03:42:19.285 --> 03:42:21.106]  Free shipping store-wide.
[03:42:21.106 --> 03:42:22.066]  Patriot Apparel.
[03:42:22.066 --> 03:42:23.706]  T-shirts, ball caps, sweaters.
[03:42:23.706 --> 03:42:25.487]  A lot of it's made in America, by the way.
[03:42:25.487 --> 03:42:31.828]  It's all 50% off, including new designer anti-antifa shirt that's only selling for one month.
[03:42:31.828 --> 03:42:34.129]  Infowarsstore.com.
[03:42:34.129 --> 03:42:35.849]  50% off on super male vitality.
[03:42:36.729 --> 03:42:43.455]  50% off on so many of the other amazing products that are on the website.
[03:42:43.455 --> 03:42:44.235]  I had all the stuff.
[03:42:44.235 --> 03:42:45.016]  Here it is.
[03:42:45.016 --> 03:42:51.221]  Super Blue Toothpaste, Super Blue Mouthwash, Wattle Silver 9N, DNA Force, Secret 12, Vitamin Mineral Fusion.
[03:42:52.438 --> 03:42:55.880]  My fellow freedom lovers, Alex Jones here with a very important message.
[03:43:11.471 --> 03:43:22.497]  Really, really good news is that yes, we're having to end the sale of 50% off on Anthroplex, but DNA Force, after almost four months, out of stock is back in stock.
[03:43:22.497 --> 03:43:24.478]  25% off our flagship product.
[03:43:24.478 --> 03:43:29.301]  Also, Biome Defense, the great probiotic, that is 25% off as well.
[03:43:29.301 --> 03:43:30.662]  So a lot of things are selling out.
[03:43:30.882 --> 03:43:33.683]  But a lot of things are still at record sales.
[03:43:33.683 --> 03:43:37.985]  Like Silver Bullet, super high quality colloidal silver is still 50% off.
[03:43:37.985 --> 03:43:42.087]  And there's other sales that are still going, but they're all about to end.
[03:43:42.087 --> 03:43:48.570]  Whether it's DNA Force, or whether it's Silver Bullet, it's all available right now at InfoWarsLife.com or by calling toll free, 888-253-3139.
[03:43:52.936 --> 03:43:56.061]  America is an information-based civil war.
[03:43:56.061 --> 03:44:03.511]  That's why now more than ever we've got to hit the streets of America and let these globalist scum know we're not backing down from their bullying.
[03:44:03.511 --> 03:44:09.099]  We're only intensifying our operations in the face of their wannabe dictatorship.
[03:44:09.840 --> 03:44:17.525]  Being a conservative, a nationalist, a libertarian, or simply a free speech advocate is truly the counterculture.
[03:44:17.525 --> 03:44:25.451]  The real punk rock is being a patriot who's pro-America, pro-capitalism, and pro-freedom, who at the same time is tolerant.
[03:44:26.131 --> 03:44:31.195]  Modern liberalism is a counterfeit of Thomas Jefferson's classical liberalism.
[03:44:31.195 --> 03:44:33.316]  They are the anti-liberals.
[03:44:33.316 --> 03:44:46.726]  To defend free speech, meet like-minded friends, and promote freedom worldwide, we've got more than 60 original designs of high-quality t-shirts for men and women, as well as more patriot apparel at InfoWarsTore.com.
[03:44:46.726 --> 03:44:50.669]  Be part of the Second American Revolution at InfoWarsTore.com.
[03:44:52.881 --> 03:45:12.856]  I want to plow into all of this, but I'm going to spend a few minutes here first, just encouraging listeners to understand that when you buy t-shirts, or water filtration systems, or books, or videos, or other materiel from InfoWarsTore.com, you are funding the revolution.
[03:45:12.856 --> 03:45:14.978]  I mean, I cannot say it any clearer.
[03:45:14.978 --> 03:45:18.981]  And so it is essential that you purchase the products at InfoWarsTore.com.
[03:45:18.981 --> 03:45:20.002]  I want to thank everybody that has.
[03:45:20.402 --> 03:45:28.608]  We've got the best chloride-free toothpaste with colloidal silver and with high-quality atomic iodine, and you cannot beat that for children and adults.
[03:45:28.608 --> 03:45:31.229]  We've got the best mouthwash designed by Dr. Jones.
[03:45:31.229 --> 03:45:34.031]  That's my dad, with colloidal silver and iodine as well.
[03:45:34.031 --> 03:45:36.533]  Infowarslife.com or 888-253-3139.
[03:45:36.533 --> 03:45:45.719]  And your purchase of the products stands with us, stands with America, stands with Trump, stands against the globalists and their satanic pedophile armies.
[03:45:45.719 --> 03:45:50.162]  And that's who they are, and they know we know who they are, and they're coming back against us, so we need your support.
[03:45:52.983 --> 03:46:00.465]  I am very proud to announce the introduction of the highest quality InfoWars Biome Defense Probiotic.
[03:46:00.465 --> 03:46:13.669]  We wanted to come out with the largest spectrum of high quality known probiotics that have been proven to improve overall digestion and health and detoxification in the body.
[03:46:14.608 --> 03:46:26.504]  Biome Defense is an exclusive blend of 50 billion live and active cultures from over 23 different probiotic strains that are known to support digestion and intestinal function.
[03:46:26.504 --> 03:46:32.471]  Our researchers are confident that we have been able to develop what will be the leading probiotic on the market.
[03:46:33.212 --> 03:46:42.236]  Secure your biome defense in ultra-strength or regular strength at InfoWarsLife.com today and get started supporting your digestive system naturally.
[03:46:42.236 --> 03:46:56.143]  We've been testing this formula for years, but this is the limited first run to the public, so please take advantage of it today, support your own health, and support the InfoWar.
[03:46:56.143 --> 03:46:58.784]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:47:14.301 --> 03:47:18.684]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[03:47:18.684 --> 03:47:26.390]  You're listening to Alex Jones.
[03:47:26.390 --> 03:47:30.993]  By the way, we knew that Trump was going to greenlight going after pedophile networks.
[03:47:30.993 --> 03:47:32.634]  He tweeted that years ago.
[03:47:32.634 --> 03:47:36.277]  And Newsweek asked, why are we obsessed with pedophiles?
[03:47:36.277 --> 03:47:38.038]  We're not obsessed with it.
[03:47:38.038 --> 03:47:43.602]  Hollywood and the globalists and the elites and the British royalty keep getting caught, including killing little kids.
[03:47:45.208 --> 03:47:46.770]  We told you this dam was going to break.
[03:47:46.770 --> 03:47:52.399]  Now, in the hysteria, there's going to be some people who are going to make false accusations.
[03:47:52.399 --> 03:47:53.480]  But a lot of them are going to be real.
[03:47:53.480 --> 03:47:55.904]  And I'm not saying what's true and what isn't.
[03:47:55.904 --> 03:48:00.290]  But with Harvey Weinstein and others, it had been reported for a long time he was basically raping women.
[03:48:00.991 --> 03:48:03.272]  I've known Charlie Sheen, his dad, and his brother.
[03:48:03.272 --> 03:48:05.652]  That's how I met him was through Emilio Estevez.
[03:48:05.652 --> 03:48:09.533]  And, you know, he's been pretty wild and, you know, partying.
[03:48:09.533 --> 03:48:13.774]  I haven't hung out with him in years because I don't do drugs and things like that.
[03:48:13.774 --> 03:48:16.115]  But Charlie was always a gentleman and nice to the women I was around.
[03:48:16.115 --> 03:48:18.636]  I never saw any gay stuff or any pedophile stuff.
[03:48:18.636 --> 03:48:20.076]  But here it is.
[03:48:20.076 --> 03:48:23.277]  Friends of Corey Haim say he accuses Charlie Sheen of rape.
[03:48:23.937 --> 03:48:24.277]  I don't
[03:48:42.796 --> 03:48:52.808]  Just like the Pizzagate where you have this huge thing confirming New York and the Aleister Crowley stuff and all the rest of it, then they focus the media over on this as a rabbit trail to get people off.
[03:48:52.808 --> 03:48:54.069]  And I'm not saying that's happening here.
[03:48:54.941 --> 03:49:01.564]  I'm just saying I never saw any signs of this or any evidence of this with Charlie Sheen.
[03:49:01.564 --> 03:49:03.764]  But again, I haven't really.
[03:49:03.764 --> 03:49:08.386]  I guess I was there with my wife before we got married.
[03:49:08.386 --> 03:49:12.548]  I had dinner with him about two years ago and he seemed really in a bad place.
[03:49:13.448 --> 03:49:15.189]  And we just left.
[03:49:15.189 --> 03:49:20.953]  But I didn't see, other than him being angry about the media lying about him, I think that was it.
[03:49:20.953 --> 03:49:24.196]  But I don't want to get into stuff like this, but I'm reporting on all of it.
[03:49:24.196 --> 03:49:34.023]  I know Charlie Sheen, and I've been friends with him like 12 years off and on, and because he's politically involved, and so I'm going to report on it in the interest of the fact that I'm reporting on all the rest of it.
[03:49:34.502 --> 03:49:42.106]  Well, I mean, how long have we been talking about corruption in Hollywood and MKUltra and the programs and the behind-the-scenes pedophilia stuff that goes on?
[03:49:42.106 --> 03:49:48.030]  And we've gotten reports of what goes on at the secret locations in Malibu and throughout Los Angeles.
[03:49:48.030 --> 03:49:57.175]  I was about to say, Charlie's the guy that told me about bad stuff and how there was Satanism and really going after the Scientologists and things.
[03:49:57.175 --> 03:50:00.697]  He was the guy telling me how bad it was and exposing it, not the other way around.
[03:50:00.697 --> 03:50:01.958]  So I think we should really look into this.
[03:50:02.358 --> 03:50:07.262]  Yeah, I mean, now you're starting to see the exposure coming to fruition.
[03:50:07.262 --> 03:50:09.263]  I mean, this is not a joke.
[03:50:09.263 --> 03:50:10.804]  I mean, you have people coming forward.
[03:50:10.804 --> 03:50:13.386]  You have, you know, police agencies looking into it.
[03:50:13.386 --> 03:50:15.908]  You had WikiLeaks, you know, with the Podesta emails.
[03:50:15.908 --> 03:50:18.389]  I mean, who knows how deep this is going to go.
[03:50:18.389 --> 03:50:20.031]  But, you know, the good news is,
[03:50:21.957 --> 03:50:24.700]  People are, the truth is actually coming out.
[03:50:24.700 --> 03:50:27.283]  And we're seeing that in a lot of different areas right now.
[03:50:27.283 --> 03:50:34.191]  It's a really good time right now to be alive and to see the things that you've known about that are being exposed.
[03:50:34.191 --> 03:50:35.152]  What do you think of Corey Feldman?
[03:50:35.152 --> 03:50:38.015]  I think he's very articulate and very well spoken on these shows.
[03:50:39.121 --> 03:50:40.642]  I think he comes across pretty credible.
[03:50:40.642 --> 03:50:42.044]  Yeah, I do.
[03:50:42.044 --> 03:50:42.524]  I agree.
[03:50:42.524 --> 03:50:51.812]  He comes across pretty credible, and time will tell how this whole thing pans out, but I guarantee you a lot of people are nervous right now, and it goes a lot deeper than Hollywood.
[03:50:51.812 --> 03:50:57.337]  It goes into a lot of the political arena, and I think a lot of people are running scared right now.
[03:50:57.337 --> 03:51:01.641]  Senators, high-level officials.
[03:51:01.641 --> 03:51:04.683]  By the way, we ought to find that clip of him on Dr. Oz yesterday.
[03:51:05.584 --> 03:51:07.386]  Or was it Dr. Oz or was it Dr. Phil?
[03:51:07.386 --> 03:51:09.447]  I just heard about it earlier in my ear.
[03:51:09.447 --> 03:51:14.871]  That he went on and called and filed a complaint on air with the Los Angeles Police Department.
[03:51:14.871 --> 03:51:15.892]  Alright, let's go to some calls.
[03:51:15.892 --> 03:51:18.654]  I've been really bad here, I apologize.
[03:51:18.654 --> 03:51:23.538]  Roger Stone is riding shotgun about to take over in the next 5 minutes, 10 minutes.
[03:51:23.538 --> 03:51:26.220]  Let's go ahead and talk to Kevin in Florida.
[03:51:26.220 --> 03:51:29.222]  You're on the air.
[03:51:29.222 --> 03:51:30.823]  Thank you so much Alex for taking my call.
[03:51:32.085 --> 03:51:44.628]  I just wanted to say I'm a huge Trump supporter, voted for him, but the one thing I think that he's trying to drop the ball on is the whole indicting any of these criminal politicians.
[03:51:44.628 --> 03:51:48.429]  Maybe Roger could elaborate on that, of why that hasn't been done.
[03:51:48.429 --> 03:51:52.470]  I think it's not necessarily that somebody gets convicted.
[03:51:52.470 --> 03:51:58.511]  I think it's more or less that the majority of the people know that the rules don't apply to everyone.
[03:51:59.091 --> 03:52:00.052]  That's a good question.
[03:52:00.052 --> 03:52:00.613]  Dr. Gribb, Mr. Stone?
[03:52:17.631 --> 03:52:19.592]  I'll let Mr. Stone answer that one.
[03:52:19.592 --> 03:52:22.475]  He's got the inside connects on that answer.
[03:52:22.475 --> 03:52:27.438]  I think the problem here is obvious, and that is we do not have a Trump Justice Department.
[03:52:27.438 --> 03:52:39.587]  We have a hijacked Justice Department, dominated by Obama holdovers, working closely with Rod Rosenstein, the liberal Republican former U.S.
[03:52:39.587 --> 03:52:45.912]  attorney from Maryland, whose political patron in the Trump administration is, believe it or not,
[03:52:46.492 --> 03:52:47.853]  It's ridiculous!
[03:53:07.842 --> 03:53:21.109]  I mean, look, in both the BCCI scandal and later in the biggest financial swindle of all time, the mortgage meltdown, no banker, no rich person, no one went to jail.
[03:53:21.109 --> 03:53:28.993]  Robert Mueller would conveniently arrange for you to pay... Sure, Robert Mueller is as dirty as a public toilet, so why is he still in power?
[03:53:29.713 --> 03:53:34.956]  Well, because I think the American people don't know this guy's pedigree and his track record.
[03:53:34.956 --> 03:53:46.843]  Whether it is smuggling Bin Laden relatives outside, out of the country, the day after 9-11, or whether it is calling off the investigation into foreign national...
[03:53:47.824 --> 03:53:57.346]  They're going after their backdoor with the takeout of the Wahhabist and the Clintons and the Bushes inside Powell's, funneling their Saudi Arabian money in to prop up the New World Order.
[03:53:57.346 --> 03:54:00.787]  I mean, isn't Trump really delivering when he dynamites their operations?
[03:54:00.787 --> 03:54:01.807]  Oh, there's no question.
[03:54:01.807 --> 03:54:10.769]  And I think the net results of these tumultuous changes in Saudi are going to be good for the United States.
[03:54:10.769 --> 03:54:13.849]  Prince bin Salman is not soft on Iran.
[03:54:13.849 --> 03:54:16.210]  He is not soft on radical terrorism.
[03:54:16.210 --> 03:54:17.610]  Now, I have many, many, many
[03:54:18.010 --> 03:54:20.712]  Well, I think what Trump's saying is no more double games.
[03:54:36.083 --> 03:54:49.830]  Well, and look, he's going to ultimately hold the Saudis accountable, and they have some explaining to do, but in essence, what the young prince has done is gotten rid of the Bush-era allies who sucked up millions in foreign corruption.
[03:54:49.830 --> 03:54:52.251]  Well, yeah, the main prince that was against Trump, in front of the Democrats.
[03:54:52.251 --> 03:54:54.512]  Oh, he's in jail now.
[03:54:54.512 --> 03:54:55.633]  Thank you, Kevin.
[03:54:55.633 --> 03:55:00.395]  The bologna sandwiches in there are really good, Al Weed, really good.
[03:55:00.395 --> 03:55:02.777]  Let's talk to Barry in San Francisco.
[03:55:02.777 --> 03:55:03.337]  Thanks for holding.
[03:55:04.737 --> 03:55:07.319]  Thanks for your time here, Alex.
[03:55:07.319 --> 03:55:11.222]  Say, AT&T's about to purchase Time Warner.
[03:55:11.222 --> 03:55:12.603]  Big mistake.
[03:55:12.603 --> 03:55:21.270]  And it ties into whether you have the courage to go with LennonMurderTruth.com or not.
[03:55:21.270 --> 03:55:24.713]  Sir, I don't know what you're talking about.
[03:55:24.713 --> 03:55:29.136]  LennonMurderTruth.com exposes Time and Newsweek.
[03:55:29.136 --> 03:55:31.458]  Newsweek, by the way, selling off half their operation now.
[03:55:32.350 --> 03:55:37.214]  As carriers of government codes in the headlines, all about John Lennon's murder.
[03:55:37.214 --> 03:55:39.495]  Okay, listen, listen.
[03:55:39.495 --> 03:55:41.277]  Whatever you're smoking, I want some of it.
[03:55:41.277 --> 03:55:42.397]  Yeah, I like it.
[03:55:42.397 --> 03:55:43.378]  John Lennon's murder.
[03:55:43.378 --> 03:55:44.199]  We're cooking now.
[03:55:44.199 --> 03:55:45.099]  I'm not!
[03:55:45.099 --> 03:55:45.760]  Okay?
[03:55:45.760 --> 03:55:47.601]  I think John Lennon was murdered.
[03:55:47.601 --> 03:55:48.662]  I think the government was involved.
[03:55:48.662 --> 03:55:53.265]  They had like Strom Thurmond's Shig and 13, get rid of this son of a, you know what?
[03:55:53.265 --> 03:55:54.466]  Because they didn't like him.
[03:55:54.466 --> 03:55:57.148]  John Lennon was really waking up to population control.
[03:55:57.148 --> 03:55:59.530]  He was writing albums about Satanist in government.
[03:55:59.530 --> 03:56:00.911]  I'm not at liberty to get into it.
[03:56:01.471 --> 03:56:05.614]  But I have talked to the family, they contacted me years ago and I'm just going to leave it at that.
[03:56:05.614 --> 03:56:11.638]  Yoko Ono, Sean Lennon, I'm just going to leave it, I've never said that until today.
[03:56:11.638 --> 03:56:19.823]  Alex, interestingly, the security guard at the Dakota where he was gunned down was there for two months and then left.
[03:56:19.823 --> 03:56:27.148]  Strange that he worked for the Central Intelligence Agency in the Bay of Pigs operation and he appears to have gone back on the government payroll.
[03:56:27.148 --> 03:56:31.131]  He just happened to be the doorman at the time of John Lennon's murder.
[03:56:31.631 --> 03:56:32.733]  How interesting.
[03:56:32.733 --> 03:56:34.755]  Yeah, so you say, do I have the courage, Barry?
[03:56:34.755 --> 03:56:40.363]  I mean, I've, I like, reviewed, uh, the people, what is it, the government versus John Lennon, the film.
[03:56:40.363 --> 03:56:42.746]  I mean, I've, I've been all over that.
[03:56:42.746 --> 03:56:42.906]  Yeah.
[03:56:46.468 --> 03:56:47.329]  Okay, thank you.
[03:56:47.329 --> 03:56:48.810]  But thank you for your call.
[03:56:48.810 --> 03:56:49.892]  I'm going to admit it.
[03:56:49.892 --> 03:56:50.853]  I killed John Lennon.
[03:56:50.853 --> 03:56:55.037]  I think I was like six years old, but I remember my mother crying.
[03:56:55.037 --> 03:56:56.238]  I mean bawling.
[03:56:56.238 --> 03:57:00.142]  That's almost the only thing that Mueller left out of his indictment of Mueller.
[03:57:00.142 --> 03:57:02.865]  He should have indicted him for killing John Lennon as well.
[03:57:02.865 --> 03:57:05.548]  It would be just as ridiculous as the charges he did bring.
[03:57:07.839 --> 03:57:11.182]  I just, the callers are like, do you have the courage to expose they killed John Lennon?
[03:57:11.182 --> 03:57:14.405]  I'm like, of course, I don't know, it's crazy.
[03:57:14.405 --> 03:57:15.446]  Dr. Group, thanks for coming in.
[03:57:15.446 --> 03:57:16.367]  Thanks for having me on.
[03:57:16.367 --> 03:57:20.271]  Great job, you got 50% off a lot of the products and free shipping.
