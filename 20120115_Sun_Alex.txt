[00:00.000 --> 00:02.000]  We've got it
[00:07.400 --> 00:09.400]  Waging war on corruption
[00:09.400 --> 00:38.860]  Welcome my friends welcome and thank you so much for joining us on this live
[00:38.860 --> 00:50.320]  Sunday the 15th day of January 2012 we're going to be live here for the next
[00:50.320 --> 00:56.080]  two hours and what I'm gonna do today is something to shake the show up a bit
[00:56.080 --> 01:01.160]  not because the show isn't exploding by leaps and bounds and breaking all
[01:01.160 --> 01:05.880]  previous records but I still don't want to become stagnant here I want to open
[01:05.880 --> 01:14.360]  the phones up at about 20 after or so today and take phone calls pretty much
[01:14.360 --> 01:21.160]  in the first hour and then get into more of the news in the second hour and so
[01:21.160 --> 01:24.040]  without further ado I'm going to give the phone number out right now you guys
[01:24.040 --> 01:30.480]  got the phone system open and ready to roll fantastic on any issue you want to
[01:30.480 --> 01:36.320]  mention the Iran situation European countries losing their debt credit
[01:36.320 --> 01:42.160]  rating IBM announcing the casual society rentness scanning to buy and sell
[01:42.160 --> 01:47.720]  that Harris has got big news on potential election fraud going on Ron
[01:47.720 --> 01:59.360]  Paul surging that's just some of the news we've got coming up today also I want
[01:59.360 --> 02:03.200]  to get into the fact that Stephen Colbert is talking about running for
[02:03.200 --> 02:08.560]  president to kind of make things a joke he's putting out political ads making
[02:08.560 --> 02:13.840]  fun of Romney and really it makes all this criminality a joke but that's what
[02:13.840 --> 02:18.720]  they do quote as you know comedy people but a lot of times they can tell more
[02:18.720 --> 02:26.480]  truth as comics than the bought and paid for globalist ABC NBC CBS Fox CNN can
[02:26.480 --> 02:32.600]  do but still it pretty much has the same goal in the final equation a week or so
[02:32.600 --> 02:37.200]  ago they had a report on the National Defense Authorization Act and John I
[02:37.200 --> 02:43.120]  meant to play or to play today John Stewart makes jokes about it it's not a
[02:43.120 --> 02:46.880]  laughing matter the end of the Bill of Rights the end of the Constitution this
[02:46.880 --> 02:51.560]  is earth-shattering type stuff that is happening so we're going to get to that
[02:51.560 --> 03:01.280]  first but the toll-free number to join us on air here on the Sunday
[03:01.280 --> 03:11.000]  transmission is 877-789 Alex 877-789-2539 and we don't screen your calls but if
[03:11.000 --> 03:16.200]  you'd like to tell us some of the basics maybe one line of what you're
[03:16.200 --> 03:20.800]  calling in about or one word that that like I disagree then you go to the head
[03:20.800 --> 03:30.000]  of the line the toll-free number again is 877-789-2539 here on this live Sunday
[03:30.000 --> 03:34.560]  edition obviously big developments every day there's huge developments in the
[03:34.560 --> 03:41.120]  economy in Iran in Syria Russia saying they take it as a military threat to
[03:41.120 --> 03:47.280]  their national interest if Syria or Iran are struck within a day of Russia saying
[03:47.280 --> 03:52.560]  that the United States canceled its drill in Australia for Moose menacing
[03:52.560 --> 04:02.880]  Iranian forces so still the Ruskies and their big ICBM baseball bat have some
[04:02.880 --> 04:07.680]  effect because the Russians are not known to make threats without being ready
[04:07.680 --> 04:11.760]  to follow through with them in fact even during the Cuban Missile Crisis they
[04:11.760 --> 04:16.320]  were not threatening to use nuclear weapons when the United States back
[04:16.320 --> 04:22.520]  Jordan forces with NATO attack Russian held at Kasia and South Ossetia the
[04:22.520 --> 04:27.640]  Russians did roll in a medium-range mobile missile launchers their chairman of
[04:27.640 --> 04:34.960]  Joint Chiefs of Staff did come out and he said if you don't stop landing US troops
[04:34.960 --> 04:39.400]  and NATO troops these airports we're going to fire nuclear weapons at you
[04:39.400 --> 04:44.720]  needless to say Cheney blanked bionic heart and all and they load the troops
[04:44.720 --> 04:50.760]  back up on the aircraft but they still engage in a probing exercise I guess
[04:50.760 --> 04:55.520]  his old wicked men it's the only thing that gets their hearts beating we'll be
[04:55.520 --> 05:01.520]  right back stay with us hi this is Alex Jones did you know that the global
[05:01.520 --> 05:05.080]  elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds and secret storage vaults near the
[05:05.080 --> 05:08.840]  Arctic Circle did you know that in a real meltdown non-hybrid seeds could
[05:08.840 --> 05:12.520]  become more valuable than silver or gold it's true seeds that all perform even
[05:12.520 --> 05:15.760]  golden silver before in this country and it's possible that could even happen
[05:15.760 --> 05:19.880]  again so our friends at solutions from science have put together the perfect
[05:19.880 --> 05:25.280]  mix of non-hybrid seeds they call it a survival seed bank and it can produce an
[05:25.280 --> 05:29.320]  endless supply of nutrient-dense food for you and your family and here's the
[05:29.320 --> 05:33.280]  best part these seeds have not been genetically modified in any way and you
[05:33.280 --> 05:37.400]  actually get enough seeds to plant a full acre crisis garden so visit them
[05:37.400 --> 05:42.600]  today at survivalseedbank.com that's survivalseedbank.com or give them a
[05:42.600 --> 05:52.760]  call at 877-327-0365 that's 877-327-0365 remember in a real crisis
[05:52.760 --> 05:56.880]  non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item this is Alex Jones for
[05:56.880 --> 05:59.960]  survivalseedbank.com
[05:59.960 --> 06:11.080]  you are listening to an Infowars.com frontline report if you are receiving
[06:11.080 --> 06:15.880]  this transmission you are the resistance
[06:20.640 --> 06:28.560]  from deep in the heart of FEMA region 6 Austin Texas transmitting worldwide it's
[06:28.560 --> 06:31.840]  Alex Jones
[06:37.560 --> 06:42.200]  welcome my friends welcome to all of you out there listening on the AM and FM
[06:42.200 --> 06:48.680]  dial via the internet at Infowars.com and prisonplanet.tv and those listening on
[06:48.680 --> 06:54.000]  global shortwave as well as the weekday radio listeners that listen on XM thank
[06:54.000 --> 07:00.200]  you so much for joining us while others are watching football this Sunday
[07:00.200 --> 07:07.560]  afternoon and while others are going to the topless bars or doing whatever
[07:07.560 --> 07:12.640]  people do we are here live on the radio and a lot of you are listening to us as
[07:12.640 --> 07:21.320]  well because we understand that the future of human civilization is in the
[07:21.320 --> 07:28.880]  balance right now and is being decided and the tyrannies that we face as a
[07:28.880 --> 07:35.000]  society are not a joke in every case in history when governments remove checks
[07:35.000 --> 07:39.560]  and balances remove the common right of the people and assail the right of the
[07:39.560 --> 07:45.280]  family and property and the right of self-defense giant wars subjugation
[07:45.280 --> 07:54.000]  enslavement always invariably follow and we could see that we are on that road
[07:54.000 --> 07:58.440]  to perdition that road to tyranny that road to oppression that road to bondage
[07:58.440 --> 08:07.120]  serfdom slavery we are being usurped by highly competitive combines of mega
[08:07.120 --> 08:11.960]  corporations that control government and our anti-free market what is known as
[08:11.960 --> 08:18.440]  crony monopoly capitalist who use socialism and fascism and other forms
[08:18.440 --> 08:22.320]  of command and control to control populations now here's what I'm going
[08:22.320 --> 08:27.480]  to do shaking the show up we're going to start going to your phone calls in the
[08:27.480 --> 08:32.040]  next segment today and then I'll do the main news in the first 30 minutes of the
[08:32.040 --> 08:39.520]  next hour and then go back in to your calls coming up in the second hour US
[08:39.520 --> 08:44.160]  warns Israel on strike officials lobby against attack on Iran as military
[08:44.160 --> 08:49.160]  leaders bolstered defense 15,000 US troops additionally are added to the
[08:49.160 --> 08:56.760]  Kuwait forces more than 2,000 US troops now on the ground in Israel Jericho
[08:56.760 --> 09:02.680]  medium range ICBMs nuclear tipped are fueled on the Israeli tarmac and
[09:02.680 --> 09:09.120]  gantries Iran says it as evidence the US is behind scientists is killing along
[09:09.120 --> 09:13.160]  with the other now admitted covert war inside Iran a rod side of Israel
[09:13.160 --> 09:17.640]  reports Israel and US postponed massive defense drill in fear of
[09:17.640 --> 09:23.360]  escalation with Iran Iran until about two weeks ago has denied their bases
[09:23.360 --> 09:26.040]  are getting blown up and all this is happening because it makes them look
[09:26.040 --> 09:32.160]  weak now their public knows they've got forces all over their country including
[09:32.160 --> 09:37.000]  four Al-Qaeda groups blowing up dams shooting police of course Al-Qaeda works
[09:37.000 --> 09:40.800]  for the banks that run the US they've been given Libya Amar al-Alaqi the
[09:40.800 --> 09:44.480]  former number three in Al Qaeda they claim they've killed now I predicted
[09:44.480 --> 09:47.200]  they would have a stage killing of him when it came out he really worked for
[09:47.200 --> 09:53.680]  the CIA and the Pentagon as Fox News reported but Israel and US postponed
[09:53.680 --> 09:57.760]  massive defense drill in fear of escalation with Iran they were later
[09:57.760 --> 10:04.000]  the next week to have ships steam right up Israeli and US ships right up to the
[10:04.000 --> 10:08.920]  Iranian ships and the Iranians had said as you know we can have a go okay go
[10:08.920 --> 10:12.760]  ahead and come back through with your fleet this is your only warning don't
[10:12.760 --> 10:20.280]  do it we are going to attack you and the Iranians are well known they do not make
[10:20.280 --> 10:24.600]  threats they don't make threats if they tell you they're gonna do something they
[10:24.600 --> 10:28.280]  pretty much do it same thing with the Russians and again I'm not on the side
[10:28.280 --> 10:32.720]  of the Russians or side of the Iranians I'm giving you facts here not what I
[10:32.720 --> 10:36.640]  want to think or what I want to believe geopolitically are analyzing different
[10:36.640 --> 10:43.160]  countries as I do with my obsession with reality but what will happen the
[10:43.160 --> 10:47.320]  Russians do not make threats they didn't during the Cuban Missile Crisis to use
[10:47.320 --> 10:53.240]  nuclear weapons they did in 2008 on 888 when the Olympics kicked off when
[10:53.240 --> 10:57.160]  Cheney decided that was later declassified through NATO to launch a
[10:57.160 --> 11:04.240]  sneak attack on South Ossetia and Abkhazia in Georgia Russian controlled areas as
[11:04.240 --> 11:10.200]  US forces began to land and mass to back up the Georgians the head of the
[11:10.200 --> 11:15.480]  Russian Joint Chiefs of Staff was all over BBC wasn't on US TV went out and
[11:15.480 --> 11:19.640]  gave a speech and said we have rolled missile launchers in with medium range
[11:19.640 --> 11:25.480]  nukes on the big trucks we're preparing to fire them at the Georgian bases you
[11:25.480 --> 11:29.720]  have 12 hours to pull out and the US pulled out now you have to ask yourself
[11:29.720 --> 11:34.400]  why is our government trying to start World War three with the Russians why
[11:34.400 --> 11:38.680]  are they trying to start the shutdown the Strait of Hormuz with the with the
[11:38.680 --> 11:42.920]  Iranians when China says that is a military attack on them that's their
[11:42.920 --> 11:47.000]  ally and where they get 20% of their oil the Russians say that's on their door
[11:47.000 --> 11:52.480]  step because just Iran does border Russia and you notice the United States
[11:52.480 --> 11:58.000]  announced this about what 15 hours or so ago that they're gonna stop and
[11:58.000 --> 12:05.600]  cancel this big naval engagement with the Iranians basically that now the
[12:05.600 --> 12:12.680]  Russians have come out and said well here's the headline from RT which is
[12:12.680 --> 12:16.920]  Russian television Russian today should anything happen to Iran this will be a
[12:16.920 --> 12:22.400]  direct threat to our national security this is the same thing on Iran the
[12:22.400 --> 12:26.840]  full quote in video of their foreign minister is there and so he tells the
[12:26.840 --> 12:32.360]  US yesterday listen do you attack them it's an attack on us to the attack on
[12:32.360 --> 12:37.560]  our sovereignty and suddenly the fleet's cruising right up to the Iranians and all
[12:37.560 --> 12:44.080]  the war talk stops because now China and Russia are signaling that they are
[12:44.080 --> 12:52.540]  going to take this as an attack on them now could it be a bluff Chinese don't
[12:52.540 --> 12:59.400]  bluff either folks it's kind of like the walk softly carry a big stick it's not
[12:59.400 --> 13:03.320]  China racing around the world invading all these countries and bombing people
[13:03.320 --> 13:06.880]  and doing all this China's taking over their economic development and by the
[13:06.880 --> 13:10.040]  way I don't like the communist Chinese leadership and all their fat generals
[13:10.040 --> 13:14.840]  sucking off the Chinese people I don't like the corruption in Russia I don't
[13:14.840 --> 13:20.800]  like who runs Iran the point is America isn't run by America either America is
[13:20.800 --> 13:26.280]  run by the fortune 100 megabanks the six big megabanks that financed the
[13:26.280 --> 13:30.320]  fortune 100 who have gotten the United States and Europe to sign on to their
[13:30.320 --> 13:39.880]  1,500 trillion the Washington Post says 646 trillion 600 plus trillion of that is
[13:39.880 --> 13:47.000]  quote our debt now the American people in government only owe 15 trillion 100
[13:47.000 --> 13:54.040]  and something billion what is it 15.143 trillion you look it up that's the
[13:54.040 --> 14:05.320]  latest number as of Friday 15 trillion point 143 143 bill and I'm told I'm in
[14:05.320 --> 14:09.040]  debt and I've got to have my taxes raised and everything cut with potholes
[14:09.040 --> 14:13.000]  everywhere because because I'm in debt I didn't pay enough taxes I didn't work
[14:13.000 --> 14:17.840]  enough truth is our country's incredibly wealthy folks but almost all the tax
[14:17.840 --> 14:22.280]  money now goes in banker bailouts that aren't really banker bailouts the
[14:22.280 --> 14:26.920]  megabanks get the government to sign on to their 600 plus trillion just for the
[14:26.920 --> 14:31.920]  US alone globally it's 1.5 trillion and growing and and I know I'd say this
[14:31.920 --> 14:35.360]  every week because it's so important it's the answer to the riddle it's why
[14:35.360 --> 14:40.560]  all this is happening and then they say okay we got to raise your taxes and cut
[14:40.560 --> 14:44.680]  everything and have the age of austerity and cut the military and cut
[14:44.680 --> 14:52.040]  everything because everything's got to go to the bankers and then the bankers
[14:52.040 --> 14:55.920]  themselves the big megabanks blame the free market so they can use government
[14:55.920 --> 14:59.360]  to knock out all their competition when this is not free market that did all of
[14:59.360 --> 15:07.760]  this now here's the Russian foreign minister Iran is our close neighbor just
[15:07.760 --> 15:11.440]  south of the caucus so should anything happen to Iran should Iran get drawn at
[15:11.440 --> 15:14.760]  any political or military hardships this will be a direct threat for national
[15:14.760 --> 15:21.920]  security and that's the there's two quotes or that's Dmitry Raghazan Russian
[15:21.920 --> 15:25.840]  deputy prime minister and former envoy to NATO and there's another quote in
[15:25.840 --> 15:31.000]  here by their foreign their their ambassador the US there's a whole bunch
[15:31.000 --> 15:34.600]  of these quotes I mean this is this is dangerous and just like World War one or
[15:34.600 --> 15:37.800]  World War two it's not even a big news item people are talking about this
[15:37.800 --> 15:42.720]  cruise ship sinking and the Mediterranean off the coast of Italy and five dead
[15:42.720 --> 15:47.320]  they're talking about you know the Washington Redskins the San Francisco
[15:47.320 --> 15:52.960]  49ers and then meanwhile folks if there's a war with Iran bare minimum you're
[15:52.960 --> 15:57.760]  paying $7 a gallon for gas in a couple weeks all right your phone calls coming

[20:00.560 --> 20:07.520]  coast to coast direct from Austin you're listening to the Alex Jones broadcasting
[20:07.520 --> 20:19.240]  network network what we've got here is failure to communicate some man you just
[20:19.240 --> 20:26.800]  can't read so you get what we had here last week which is the way he wants well
[20:26.800 --> 20:45.920]  he's waging war on corruption it's Alex Jones in the final equation it's
[20:45.920 --> 20:51.480]  really simple the new world order is a group of finance oligarchs that control
[20:51.480 --> 20:55.320]  the issuance of currency and credit through fractional reserve money
[20:55.320 --> 21:00.240]  changing fraud the derivatives are an example of that just absolutely
[21:00.240 --> 21:04.880]  worthless but they have government sign you on to pay taxes to back up the
[21:04.880 --> 21:10.640]  derivatives so now they have value and instead of going to jail the big mega
[21:10.640 --> 21:15.400]  banks all six of them that created this fraud take over the world and abolish
[21:15.400 --> 21:19.840]  national sovereignty and sell everyone on the fact that your taxes have to go up
[21:19.840 --> 21:24.800]  and your liberties have to go away in the new age of austerity so that they the
[21:24.800 --> 21:29.720]  technocratic bankers who engineered all this can run your life and because the
[21:29.720 --> 21:33.880]  general public has been raised in front of a television set believing who wins
[21:33.880 --> 21:37.440]  the football game is all that matters it's not even a language that people
[21:37.440 --> 21:42.800]  speak and so they're like dodo birds I like to use this this analogy of
[21:42.800 --> 21:47.200]  sailors arriving on the island and the dodo birds have never had natural
[21:47.200 --> 21:50.880]  predators so they just sat there and let the sailors club them in the head and
[21:50.880 --> 21:55.520]  eat them that's kind of like people in America are folks that are under western
[21:55.520 --> 21:59.280]  mind control we just have no idea what tyranny looks like because we never lived
[21:59.280 --> 22:06.560]  under it and I'm gonna go to your calls but I was at a barbecue joint last night
[22:06.560 --> 22:13.080]  that I like a pokey Joe's in South Austin with my wife and children and they
[22:13.080 --> 22:17.520]  had the little back room closed off for a group of people but there was a curtain
[22:17.520 --> 22:20.160]  right there I could see what was going on because it was only partially closed
[22:20.160 --> 22:28.000]  howling and screaming for an hour over a football game an NFL football game and
[22:28.000 --> 22:32.400]  of course I don't pay attention I'm not cool but I could see through the crack in
[22:32.400 --> 22:38.480]  the in the in the facade there that it was the 49ers were one of the teams and
[22:38.480 --> 22:43.040]  and then later they they opened up the curtains and men were strutting around
[22:43.040 --> 22:48.320]  you know pumped up and it was screaming and yelling and children rolling on the
[22:48.320 --> 22:54.560]  floor and and howling and when someone made a touchdown it was it was f these
[22:54.560 --> 22:57.760]  men were coming in and out their children and wives were in the wives all
[22:57.760 --> 23:02.160]  had incredibly serious looks on their faces and and and they were praying and
[23:02.160 --> 23:09.320]  and you know for field goals to make it and you would think that their family
[23:09.320 --> 23:15.280]  was in a gladiatorial fight for their lives with battle axes or something and
[23:15.280 --> 23:19.800]  I'll guarantee if I walked up to those folks and said hey did you know that most
[23:19.800 --> 23:23.440]  major vaccines have cancer viruses added to them here's some documents or would
[23:23.440 --> 23:27.200]  you like to know that all over the US in the last eight months radiation levels
[23:27.200 --> 23:31.960]  have gone off the charts and here's a new report about it today but the
[23:31.960 --> 23:35.720]  government's not saying take precautions they look at me like I had a
[23:35.720 --> 23:40.000]  hundred heads or if I said hey did you know the government has just passed a
[23:40.000 --> 23:45.680]  law to allow the secret arrest of US citizens or even the killing of US
[23:45.680 --> 23:49.320]  citizens and no one even knows you're arrested or killed the essence of
[23:49.320 --> 23:52.280]  tyranny the total overthrow of our Declaration of Independence of
[23:52.280 --> 23:57.040]  Constitution guaranteed they would have looked at me like I was a man from
[23:57.040 --> 24:00.720]  Mars but if I don't walked in there because they were cheering for the 49ers
[24:00.720 --> 24:07.080]  and said how about them 49ers that would have been an embrace of family of
[24:07.080 --> 24:14.600]  tribalism of love all completely shallow all completely fake all completely
[24:14.600 --> 24:21.400]  just a veneer cheap means nothing globalist propaganda pumped in fake
[24:21.400 --> 24:25.360]  tribalism people don't have a bill of rights a Constitution a free market a
[24:25.360 --> 24:30.640]  family none of that is what you'll fight for no because all day you can wear
[24:30.640 --> 24:35.160]  your favorite teams jersey and strut around and bug your eyes out and
[24:35.160 --> 24:42.400]  primitively jump up and down like a gorilla for your team it's pure mind
[24:42.400 --> 24:49.320]  control and these people are not even living in the real world but coming up
[24:49.320 --> 24:52.680]  later I'm going to get into the draconian legislation the internet
[24:52.680 --> 24:59.240]  censorship what we face and and and the reason we have hardship and the reason
[24:59.240 --> 25:04.440]  that our prosperity is leaving the building Elvis has left the building
[25:04.440 --> 25:08.160]  freedom and prosperity are leaving the building because see when freedom leaves
[25:08.160 --> 25:17.760]  you never have prosperity freedom economic social religious all of it
[25:17.760 --> 25:22.680]  it's the bellwether it's the hallmark it's the indicator and it's leaving the
[25:22.680 --> 25:27.840]  building kind of like at the dog pound dogs that people don't want it's a dog
[25:27.840 --> 25:31.920]  pound they don't strap them down and give them shots to kill them like your
[25:31.920 --> 25:35.920]  little puppy whenever you come into the vet that's too expensive to give them a
[25:35.920 --> 25:42.080]  five-dollar shot they just fill a big chamber cram them full animals and then
[25:42.080 --> 25:46.200]  flip a lever and the oxygen is sucked out and they suffocate them it's
[25:46.200 --> 25:54.800]  essentially free to pressure chamber they just suck the oxygen out but you
[25:54.800 --> 25:58.400]  know when you go to kill your dog because it's in pain or whatever I
[25:58.400 --> 26:01.320]  understand when you go to euthanize it you want to hold it every day and they
[26:01.320 --> 26:03.920]  give it the shot and everything and there's that moment they don't throw
[26:03.920 --> 26:10.400]  sparky in the in the chamber and where you can see it screaming and yelping and
[26:10.400 --> 26:17.840]  begging some of me is carbon monoxide too I mean you don't want to see it
[26:17.840 --> 26:22.120]  begging and gnashing and and all of that no no it's it's it's it's the
[26:22.120 --> 26:28.920]  America is kind of being given a lethal injection to and then there's a whole
[26:28.920 --> 26:39.600]  ceremony to it but my point of the analogy of the euthanasia is that our
[26:39.600 --> 26:44.280]  country is just slowly having its liberties its freedom sucked out like
[26:44.280 --> 26:49.960]  oxygen and so we're now blue in the face and you'll find in Rome and Nazi
[26:49.960 --> 26:55.080]  Germany and so many other corrupt declining systems run by thugs that as
[26:55.080 --> 27:01.040]  things get worse people will cling to sports even more they won't riot over
[27:01.040 --> 27:04.920]  you losing their liberties or the cops shooting an unarmed kid in the back no
[27:04.920 --> 27:11.280]  they'll riot when their team loses or wins because see men don't go out and
[27:11.280 --> 27:15.360]  engage in combat against some tribe trying to enslave them no they go into a
[27:15.360 --> 27:25.400]  parking lot and beat some baseball fans brains out see see that's our value now
[27:25.400 --> 27:30.720]  and it's scientific and Edward Bernays 80 years ago wrote books about how they
[27:30.720 --> 27:36.560]  would sell sports not just the children but adults and let men spin their their
[27:36.560 --> 27:46.000]  tribal and in manly energies on on a facsimile I've used the analogy of it's
[27:46.000 --> 27:49.920]  the difference between actually having a wife and a woman you love and then
[27:49.920 --> 27:55.120]  actually you procreate with and create new beings with and the system says no
[27:55.120 --> 28:00.280]  no no you don't need an actual wife here's a blow-up doll that's what sports
[28:00.280 --> 28:06.520]  is for men here here's a blow-up doll do you want with black hair or blonde hair
[28:06.520 --> 28:12.440]  and that's it and then I go to these men and I say you know the I have a book
[28:12.440 --> 28:16.640]  here a scientific to manipulate you and make you only be concerned about petty
[28:16.640 --> 28:20.680]  things and paint yourself up in fake tribal colors you know why are you
[28:20.680 --> 28:24.080]  hyperventilating over your team right now I mean even if you have a big bed on
[28:24.080 --> 28:30.160]  it why is this all that's valuable to you manhood is teaching your children
[28:30.160 --> 28:34.880]  about liberties and freedoms and history and and and how to plant a garden how to
[28:34.880 --> 28:40.640]  clean a gun how to fix an engine why do you just all day strut around and and
[28:40.640 --> 28:46.960]  and they'll look at you and say listen I don't want the real Marilyn Monroe to
[28:46.960 --> 28:49.520]  be I don't want to be a real man I don't want to live in a real Republic with
[28:49.520 --> 28:54.440]  real responsibilities give me the blow-up doll and so listen this is this
[28:54.440 --> 29:00.600]  radio show is not for men that want blow-up dolls or women for that matter

[35:50.640 --> 35:54.440]  Wall Street Journal editor breaking that down and then also have this other
[35:54.440 --> 35:58.440]  articles that you mentioned Ron Paul coming up you remember with Rand how
[35:58.440 --> 36:03.800]  they had the Democratic challenger guy he was running against his employees
[36:03.800 --> 36:07.800]  would dress up as hayseeds and then to go out and say racist stuff and hold up
[36:07.800 --> 36:13.320]  racist signs well they've caught him again with Ron Paul dressing people up as
[36:13.320 --> 36:18.240]  Ku Klux Klan members and it turns out that's Republican Party doing that so
[36:18.240 --> 36:26.000]  there's gonna be some dirty tricks my friend well they're not gonna turn
[36:26.000 --> 36:31.680]  lucid power easily brother Aaron but I mean listen you got the floor you said
[36:31.680 --> 36:36.400]  you've been waiting years to get on go ahead well like I said I just you know
[36:36.400 --> 36:40.440]  you talked about dodo birds there before I'm I used to be one of those dodo
[36:40.440 --> 36:45.080]  birds I used to be back there I was right now I'd be watching you know NFL
[36:45.080 --> 36:49.800]  football you know two or three years ago but now it's it's not getting more
[36:49.800 --> 36:55.160]  I've woken up and you said it many times reality is a lot more exciting than
[36:55.160 --> 37:00.160]  than what you see on TV it certainly is God bless it give you God bless you Aaron
[37:00.160 --> 37:06.280]  and again folks I played football in high school I ran track I swam one blue
[37:06.280 --> 37:11.400]  ribbons almost every time in Dallas okay yeah Mr. Blue Ribbon Mr. Blue Ribbon
[37:11.400 --> 37:20.160]  got 50 of them or more sports themselves are great that's a wonderful
[37:20.160 --> 37:25.360]  wholesome healthy if you're in the game or if your family member is on the field
[37:25.360 --> 37:31.200]  that's completely different I nothing against high school football any of that
[37:31.200 --> 37:41.480]  but when I watch grown adults only care in a sycophantic way about NFL about NBA
[37:41.480 --> 37:47.640]  about PGA about all of this and it's everything to them and then you notice
[37:47.640 --> 37:51.520]  as a byproduct they don't care about any serious issues because I mean it's life
[37:51.520 --> 37:57.280]  and death to them it's they're living vicariously through it and I want to see
[37:57.280 --> 38:02.800]  you live I want to see you be a champion at business a champion parent I want to
[38:02.800 --> 38:07.080]  be that as well I mean it's hard to raise good children it's hard to make it in
[38:07.080 --> 38:16.480]  this economy and I'm telling you it is a societal bellwether it is known that
[38:16.480 --> 38:20.240]  a society declines people get more obsessed with sports and the system
[38:20.240 --> 38:24.320]  knows that it's called bread and circus they gave the Romans free bread
[38:24.320 --> 38:30.560]  welfare and free games bread and circus folks all right I'm gonna shut a shut up
[38:30.560 --> 38:36.040]  here good points Aaron Adam in Canada you're on the air go ahead yeah I just
[38:36.040 --> 38:42.600]  wanted to say some stuff about vaccines first off the word inoculate comes from
[38:42.600 --> 38:47.960]  Latin inocular which refers to the practice of grafting plant species
[38:47.960 --> 38:52.960]  together to make a third hybrid species given that a lot of vaccines are
[38:52.960 --> 38:57.440]  incubated in monkey kidneys I wonder what's really going on there well here's
[38:57.440 --> 39:02.440]  the deal vaccines are at least 500 years old there is some truth to it the
[39:02.440 --> 39:07.200]  problem is the companies are given liability protection and have a history
[39:07.200 --> 39:13.040]  of absolute carnage from HIV and the products on record bear pharmaceutical
[39:13.040 --> 39:19.920]  with the factor 8 blood drug slash vaccine to I mean every day or two I
[39:19.920 --> 39:24.080]  see articles about this company fine for 15 babies dying and vaccine
[39:24.080 --> 39:28.520]  experiments you cannot trust these companies that you know that's my issue
[39:28.520 --> 39:34.800]  on the vaccines well I think that when you look at what a virus really is
[39:34.800 --> 39:39.440]  it's identified by molecular size and weight not its behavior and you might as
[39:39.440 --> 39:43.600]  well add metal shavings to your car engine to protect it from metal shavings
[39:43.600 --> 39:46.800]  well I agree with you you know you really study viral technology what they
[39:46.800 --> 39:51.440]  call these fourth generation vaccines aren't even vaccines they are nanotech
[39:51.440 --> 39:58.720]  they are fully manufactured viruses that are nothing more than a self
[39:58.720 --> 40:04.920]  replicating data program that reads and runs in a cell and they're a hundred
[40:04.920 --> 40:10.480]  percent manufactured and they've got all sorts of piggyback stuff built into
[40:10.480 --> 40:13.560]  them and then you find out the big vaccine companies were all set up by
[40:13.560 --> 40:17.280]  robber baron eugenicist a hundred years ago and it's all about population
[40:17.280 --> 40:21.280]  reduction they've had vaccines out for a decade and that they haven't gotten
[40:21.280 --> 40:24.440]  approval of but we've documented their piggybacking them into other vaccines
[40:24.440 --> 40:28.760]  that actually change brain chemistry you know tour you can't be aggressive or
[40:28.760 --> 40:31.640]  you can't be depressed you've heard of the vaccines that quote cure drug
[40:31.640 --> 40:38.000]  addiction yeah by attacking endorphin receptor sites you know I ran 10 miles
[40:38.000 --> 40:46.240]  today I'm up to 10 miles now I mean I've lost 34 pounds in six weeks doing that
[40:46.240 --> 40:50.280]  and you know what I had a huge endorphin rush when I crossed over the
[40:50.280 --> 40:53.880]  eight mile mark and went over and leaned over the pole you know you know leaned
[40:53.880 --> 40:57.760]  over the side of the you know road and threw up and went ahead and ran the
[40:57.760 --> 41:02.600]  extra two miles okay I don't need a vaccine that will go and attack my my
[41:02.600 --> 41:09.080]  my receptors I want my natural dope and I'm going to get it I don't need the
[41:09.080 --> 41:12.080]  government's cocaine and heroin being shipped in but those aren't even
[41:12.080 --> 41:17.440]  vaccines those are those are fantastic you know journey in a little microbes
[41:17.440 --> 41:21.080]  that go in and hit the targets I appreciate your call great points
[41:21.080 --> 41:26.120]  Kevin Sean Mario Tommy Zach James Robert Susan Jenna will get to all of you

[42:02.080 --> 42:09.000]  never really been a doto bird I can say I've been like maybe ignorant to
[42:09.000 --> 42:13.880]  something because I did not know but I was just woken up maybe a year ago by an
[42:13.880 --> 42:18.440]  older gentleman friend of mine and he just said you know let me show you
[42:18.440 --> 42:23.360]  something he says can you get to YouTube and I said yes so I sat down and I I
[42:23.360 --> 42:27.120]  got this iPhone that I'm with the connection I could plug it into my TV and see
[42:27.120 --> 42:32.520]  everything on TV and so he told me to go to YouTube and look up loose change and
[42:32.520 --> 42:38.440]  ever since I looked that up I had another niece with me she's about 25 me and

[43:16.440 --> 43:20.680]  president in Congress and they really are calling the shots I think it's
[43:20.680 --> 43:25.880]  incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention for the
[43:25.880 --> 43:30.480]  Republic identifies the enemies of our nation the criminal offshore cartel

[43:38.600 --> 43:42.520]  matches and the Congress is saying who do we make the checkout to today seems
[43:42.520 --> 43:48.080]  like nobody does care and right now in Washington DC we have seen a fall of

[48:16.800 --> 48:23.440]  the inland area of California near the mountains and you know I'm so woke that
[48:23.440 --> 48:27.160]  I mean now I didn't understand you before when you used to say I'm getting
[48:27.160 --> 48:32.160]  chills but you know what I get those when you get them I get those sometimes
[48:32.160 --> 48:34.960]  when you're going in your ranch in your rabies and I'm driving down the street
[48:34.960 --> 48:38.560]  because I'm so addicted I don't even listen to I don't even listen to I've
[48:38.560 --> 48:41.720]  never listened to radio I don't even watch TV anymore I don't even have
[48:41.720 --> 48:46.480]  cable I sometimes will go to friend houses to watch some of the you know the
[48:46.480 --> 48:50.160]  reality shows like housewives or something like that because it's
[48:50.160 --> 48:54.920]  entertaining but as far as the news I only watch it just to compare the what
[48:54.920 --> 48:59.920]  they're leaving out I only watch it to to compare what I know is true to see
[48:59.920 --> 49:04.040]  what they're gonna lie about or not even well that's the same thing I do and
[49:04.040 --> 49:09.080]  God bless you I appreciate your call good to hear from you is is I analyze the
[49:09.080 --> 49:13.120]  corporate media just to see what they're up to but they're really blowing
[49:13.120 --> 49:18.400]  whatever credibility they had left with this excluding Ron Paul from debates or
[49:18.400 --> 49:23.320]  giving him any nine seconds or saying he can't win even though he's in second
[49:23.320 --> 49:28.440]  place all over the country and talking down to people and all these dirty tricks
[49:28.440 --> 49:33.800]  are when he does get in second place in a poll CBS and CNN and Fox all leave him
[49:33.800 --> 49:38.120]  out I mean that shows the system scared of him and any and even if you don't
[49:38.120 --> 49:43.720]  like Ron Paul's politics it shows you the system tries to make you think the
[49:43.720 --> 49:48.280]  way they want to think and who do they work for a bunch of mega corporations
[49:48.280 --> 49:51.240]  bigger than most governments who could care less about our liberties and freedoms
[49:51.240 --> 49:54.800]  and who are trying to set up a global corporate government called a new world
[49:54.800 --> 49:59.760]  order and you bet I get chills all the time when I realize this stuff it's
[49:59.760 --> 50:05.640]  mind-blowing let's go to Susan in California as well Susan welcome thank
[50:05.640 --> 50:10.240]  you Alex let me tell you it is an honor sir to actually get on your show I
[50:10.240 --> 50:14.680]  just wanted to have a little quick story for you I wanted to say thank you for
[50:14.680 --> 50:20.280]  shedding light on the Bohemian Grove I've been a listener every day for about a
[50:20.280 --> 50:26.000]  year and a half the Bohemian Grove is what set the spark and I went and found
[50:26.000 --> 50:29.360]  the information and started it just started building and building and I
[50:29.360 --> 50:33.480]  can't thank you enough for that and I share that with a lot of other you know
[50:33.480 --> 50:38.680]  friends and stuff but my comment is about the dumbing down of America and
[50:38.680 --> 50:43.640]  right now I have a foreign exchange student in our house and I'm just amazed
[50:43.640 --> 50:50.600]  because when she came here she was so she was so excited to share her culture
[50:50.600 --> 50:56.560]  and in the school that she's at now the kids she would tell me couldn't even
[50:56.560 --> 51:00.680]  didn't even know where Europe was they couldn't even point out Europe let alone
[51:00.680 --> 51:04.880]  her you know I meant to cover it and I didn't and the guys will never remember
[51:04.880 --> 51:07.960]  how to find it because I don't remember the headline there was an article like
[51:07.960 --> 51:13.120]  last Monday you guys gave me about I think was something like 40 facts about
[51:13.120 --> 51:17.560]  American school tilt about about Americans students knowledge will blow
[51:17.560 --> 51:21.640]  your mind or something like that and it was like 70 something percent can't find
[51:21.640 --> 51:27.160]  Europe I mean these numbers were just off the charts and that's the thing I
[51:27.160 --> 51:34.520]  talked to adults and they know how to do one job and go home and watch TV and
[51:34.520 --> 51:38.080]  that's it they don't know what continents are they don't know what
[51:38.080 --> 51:43.960]  different species are they don't even have basic information and it you can
[51:43.960 --> 51:48.000]  really see what they've done through this mind control and cultural dumbing
[51:48.000 --> 51:52.120]  down dust 50 years ago we had the highest test scores the most inventors
[51:52.120 --> 51:58.920]  just on every front we the New World Order has ruined us absolutely and she
[51:58.920 --> 52:01.920]  couldn't believe that the kids were more concerned about how she did her nails
[52:01.920 --> 52:06.520]  as opposed to her country I mean it was just I was just like it is just a
[52:06.520 --> 52:10.560]  hunch in the gut here is an American here's what they've done they've they've
[52:10.560 --> 52:14.160]  gotten us to give up our birthright all politics stuff who cares about that all
[52:14.160 --> 52:19.080]  history that's boring and no let's talk about what type of bra you wear what type
[52:19.080 --> 52:24.040]  of lipstick that's what's important they've given us petty mindlessness and
[52:24.040 --> 52:30.080]  made people artificially very very shallow but remember that the globalist
[52:30.080 --> 52:33.280]  have done that so the general public isn't involved in the real world so the
[52:33.280 --> 52:37.480]  current criminals can run things but the the criminals are a tiny minority
[52:37.480 --> 52:41.920]  Susan those of us that are a waker of minority but we dwarf them probably a
[52:41.920 --> 52:46.280]  thousand to one me Kissinger's top guy at Kissinger associates wrote superclass
[52:46.280 --> 52:50.440]  five years ago I had him on he says there's six thousand super gophers that
[52:50.440 --> 52:54.360]  run the whole planet less than 20 families same analysis I had reverse
[52:54.360 --> 53:00.000]  engineering their their system their oligarchy or plutocracy depending on how
[53:00.000 --> 53:04.440]  you want to look at it but but I mean there's way more us than six thousand
[53:04.440 --> 53:08.920]  of them I mean there's probably 20% of the country is pretty much awake even
[53:08.920 --> 53:14.400]  Gallup reports that so we've got tens of millions they got six thousand so the
[53:14.400 --> 53:17.920]  New World Order just because they've turned the general public into drooling
[53:17.920 --> 53:24.360]  zombies who doesn't mean they've won the game you understand that yes yes no I
[53:24.360 --> 53:29.320]  totally understand that and the other thing to that I can't believe that she's
[53:29.320 --> 53:33.280]  going to Washington DC soon she won a contest of all the different exchange
[53:33.280 --> 53:37.960]  students and I told her if they ask you who your host family is going to vote
[53:37.960 --> 53:42.760]  for you tell her Ron you tell them Ron Paul all the way you know like I said I
[53:42.760 --> 53:47.160]  was an Obama zombie and I just feel so disenfranchised and sick that I'm going
[53:47.160 --> 53:51.880]  to fight even harder for Ron Paul in his campaign well that's the way to go and
[53:51.880 --> 54:00.160]  don't feel bad Bush was so horrible and so wicked and so gross that that we
[54:00.160 --> 54:04.360]  hoped Obama we didn't support him of course but but early on oh Obama says
[54:04.360 --> 54:07.560]  he'll do this and that and then before he even got elected I said look at his
[54:07.560 --> 54:12.600]  advisors same people that are Mitt Romney's got I mean Mitt Romney is a
[54:12.600 --> 54:18.080]  carbon copy of Obama he has an R before his name instead of a D that is the
[54:18.080 --> 54:24.840]  only difference and it's so sad and so I don't want to hear any conservatives or
[54:24.840 --> 54:30.240]  libertarians or constitutionalists make fun of Obama supporters Mitt Romney I'm
[54:30.240 --> 54:35.360]  talking about his votes as a governor and what his company Bain Capital lobbied
[54:35.360 --> 54:41.720]  for abortion open borders carbon taxes wrote Obamacare do I need to keep going
[54:41.720 --> 54:48.280]  here bring her back up I can hear go ahead ma'am I get really scared about
[54:48.280 --> 54:52.080]  what they said this election and this one really makes me nervous because of
[54:52.080 --> 54:56.000]  the state we're in we can't our backers up against the wall we can't afford you
[54:56.000 --> 54:59.840]  know four more years of this and I'm just I'm really worried about this
[54:59.840 --> 55:03.560]  election how about a how about a 20-plus percent carbon tax that kicks in this
[55:03.560 --> 55:06.960]  year when everybody's already leaving California I appreciate your call I
[55:06.960 --> 55:10.520]  mean and people are like why would the government raise taxes when they know
[55:10.520 --> 55:15.520]  that stalls economies because the big mega insiders want to shut down
[55:15.520 --> 55:21.020]  everybody else yeah why did Napoleon burn whole countries because he was
[55:21.020 --> 55:26.080]  taking over why did Hitler do that it's cold scorched earth ladies and gentlemen
[55:26.080 --> 55:28.760]  let's jam in one more before we go to the second hour I'll continue with calls
[55:28.760 --> 55:32.120]  so these are off the board then I'm gonna get to all the news but I'm taking
[55:32.120 --> 55:37.000]  calls right now Kevin in New York you're on the air welcome first-time caller
[55:37.000 --> 55:42.200]  long-time listener thanks for everything I was listening to the New York of CBS
[55:42.200 --> 55:46.880]  a.m. affiliate last week and they were talking about on their business report
[55:46.880 --> 55:51.520]  how if the Wall Street executives don't get their big bonuses that's going to
[55:51.520 --> 55:55.360]  have a detrimental effect on the local economy here in the tri-state area which
[55:55.360 --> 55:59.200]  is something you hear about every year for the last quarter century and I live
[55:59.200 --> 56:03.360]  alone and I go into this Alex Jones style rant where I just you know say
[56:03.360 --> 56:06.640]  it's because they're getting the bonuses because they're selling this toxic
[56:06.640 --> 56:11.480]  derivative garbage that that it's a big detriment to our economy to begin with
[56:11.480 --> 56:15.960]  and not you know this bipartisan oh if they don't get their bonuses well let
[56:15.960 --> 56:18.520]  me crystallize it and then we'll hold you over we need you to have you finish
[56:18.520 --> 56:23.160]  but for listeners that just tuned in they simplify it oh you're a commie for
[56:23.160 --> 56:25.640]  Occupy Wall Street I'm not saying they're all commies but that's what the
[56:25.640 --> 56:30.120]  media says either you're that or you're you know Rush Limbaugh Republican and
[56:30.120 --> 56:35.440]  then and corporations can do no wrong the truth is there's a third rail it's
[56:35.440 --> 56:42.480]  mega insiders that get government bailouts to then pay bonuses that's
[56:42.480 --> 56:46.560]  what the real Occupy Wall Street people are concerned about but the media always
[56:46.560 --> 56:50.400]  says they don't know what they want that's not really true they're not
[56:50.400 --> 56:54.560]  talking to the people I have that actually understand it so I'm all for
[56:54.560 --> 56:58.200]  somebody getting a bonus of a company that did well and stock it did well but
[56:58.200 --> 57:03.840]  most of those big firms are getting bonuses from bailouts and from selling
[57:03.840 --> 57:09.440]  people timber will stock they knew was complete garbage fraud that's not free
[57:09.440 --> 57:13.560]  market that's going to destroy our free market and the socialists are gonna
[57:13.560 --> 57:17.760]  scapegoat the free market for what the crony capitalist have done and get rid
[57:17.760 --> 57:22.120]  of the entire free market system that's made this country so great and so that's
[57:22.120 --> 57:27.440]  why when I hear fake neocons all over talk radio bought and paid for by Bain
[57:27.440 --> 57:31.000]  Capital that owns them and all the rest of them you know that's the folks with
[57:31.000 --> 57:35.800]  Mitt Romney telling you that oh no anybody that's mad about bailouts is bad
[57:35.800 --> 57:41.160]  bailouts that's corporate welfare of my tax money of big megabanks that are
[57:41.160 --> 57:44.160]  against my country call her I'm gonna come back to you right after this break
[57:44.160 --> 57:48.840]  we'll be right back stay with us info wars.com

[58:50.520 --> 58:53.880]  Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power
[58:53.880 --> 58:57.840]  generator number one new climate legislation could easily double or
[58:57.840 --> 59:02.080]  triple your electric bill number two our new energies are wants to control how
[59:02.080 --> 59:06.360]  much power your electric company allows you to have it's true total government
[59:06.360 --> 59:10.720]  control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming number
[59:10.720 --> 59:14.760]  three in some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously overloaded and
[59:14.760 --> 59:19.360]  now new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem number four
[59:19.360 --> 59:23.480]  dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids every year thousands of
[59:23.480 --> 59:27.440]  families lose their power from weather related onages number five a solar power
[59:27.440 --> 59:31.280]  generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind folks I
[59:31.280 --> 59:34.000]  really believe in the solar power generators offered by solutions from
[59:34.000 --> 59:37.440]  science one of my oldest sponsors you can get more information at
[59:37.440 --> 59:43.080]  www.mysolarbackup.com that's mysolarbackup.com remember the government
[59:43.080 --> 59:50.680]  doesn't own the Sun so go to mysolarbackup.com or call 1-877-327-0365
[59:50.680 --> 59:57.680]  coast to coast direct from Austin you're listening to the Alex Jones broadcasting
[59:57.680 --> 01:00:06.240]  network from his central Texas Command Center deep behind enemy lines the
[01:00:06.240 --> 01:00:12.760]  information war continues it's Alex Jones and the GCN radio network the
[01:00:12.760 --> 01:00:21.320]  global social engineer crime syndicate zombie controllers always use the
[01:00:21.320 --> 01:00:27.040]  crises they create or help expand as a pretext for more power for themselves
[01:00:27.040 --> 01:00:31.360]  with simplistic solutions for the public but yeah you read about the average
[01:00:31.360 --> 01:00:35.240]  secretary on Wall Street getting about a million bucks a year or more I think I
[01:00:35.240 --> 01:00:41.840]  saw 1.1 million was the number last year and you read about you read about you
[01:00:41.840 --> 01:00:45.080]  know the stock brokers and people some of them getting billions a year
[01:00:45.080 --> 01:00:50.160]  brokerage firm owners and I went and looked at it most of that is stolen its
[01:00:50.160 --> 01:00:55.120]  derivatives it's crud it's bubble it's bailout money and we've all seen the
[01:00:55.120 --> 01:00:59.680]  numbers and and then you never hear it on talk radio now it's all about some
[01:00:59.680 --> 01:01:04.880]  welfare mom has got five kids and those on welfare and I agree giving them the
[01:01:04.880 --> 01:01:08.440]  welfare help create that so why did the system do that to create a dependent
[01:01:08.440 --> 01:01:13.960]  group to vote and leverage out people that don't but again the Democrats are
[01:01:13.960 --> 01:01:17.640]  bought and paid for by the system the Republican leadership is bought and paid
[01:01:17.640 --> 01:01:21.800]  for and it's a nightmare but you've got the floor there Kevin and we went to
[01:01:21.800 --> 01:01:26.920]  break go ahead yeah and you know just on top of that I'm going to my own Orwellian
[01:01:26.920 --> 01:01:31.280]  nightmare up in Connecticut where I have an ex-girlfriend who took my car without
[01:01:31.280 --> 01:01:35.480]  knowledge or permission destroys it she was drunk the state troopers are
[01:01:35.480 --> 01:01:40.080]  complete and competent moron he doesn't give her a field sobriety test or a
[01:01:40.080 --> 01:01:44.040]  breathalyzer they let her go so I got the state trooper the prosecutor and the
[01:01:44.040 --> 01:01:48.120]  judge all tell me that I'm not a victim in this case I'm out of car plus a
[01:01:48.120 --> 01:01:52.040]  whole bunch of expenses so everything that you see in the top end of the world
[01:01:52.040 --> 01:01:56.040]  all trickles down to local stuff here and you know how do you get justice in
[01:01:56.040 --> 01:02:00.080]  this case you know by the way I want to tell Chris and other producers in there
[01:02:00.080 --> 01:02:04.400]  to make sure I cover this before the end of the show I have a whole stack here
[01:02:04.400 --> 01:02:12.720]  about what the stupid ignorantness of this society is causing because you know
[01:02:12.720 --> 01:02:16.240]  we had corrupt elites 30 years ago but they wouldn't let the military use to
[01:02:16.240 --> 01:02:21.080]  plunder uranium we had a corrupt elite 25 years ago with your noble but they
[01:02:21.080 --> 01:02:24.920]  that they told people to take precautions and I've got a whole stack here
[01:02:24.920 --> 01:02:29.960]  just where they don't care now the system just doesn't care and I have an
[01:02:29.960 --> 01:02:36.400]  article where thousands of people the LA Times reports are arrested for sex
[01:02:36.400 --> 01:02:42.000]  crimes robberies you name it and their name isn't even similar and they show
[01:02:42.000 --> 01:02:46.400]  the cops and the cops say this is the address I'm taking you to jail and
[01:02:46.400 --> 01:02:52.200]  sometimes you spend months in there and it doesn't matter I mean it things are
[01:02:52.200 --> 01:02:56.800]  breaking down because everybody passes the buck because they're too busy on
[01:02:56.800 --> 01:03:02.400]  their iPhone you know talking to their buddies and I and a lot of it is the
[01:03:02.400 --> 01:03:06.640]  complexity of the world we spend so much time doing little knick-knack stuff
[01:03:06.640 --> 01:03:10.200]  that we don't spend any time in reality I appreciate that information thank you
[01:03:10.200 --> 01:03:13.040]  Kevin Sean and pencil bank you got a minute and a half we're going to break

[01:03:27.360 --> 01:03:34.480]  here today at 6th Center home Davis is bringing a big endorsement for Ron Paul
[01:03:34.480 --> 01:03:42.440]  oh good and I want to talk about some newspaper propaganda lately I've been
[01:03:42.440 --> 01:03:46.480]  looking at a lot of newspapers around the country and they either just count
[01:03:46.480 --> 01:03:52.120]  Ron Paul together or they just you know whatever they say about them is just
[01:03:52.120 --> 01:03:56.480]  completely wrong and well the older folks of the country there they're the
[01:03:56.480 --> 01:04:02.080]  ones that you know mostly let's you know read the newspapers at all and they're
[01:04:02.080 --> 01:04:07.200]  just getting bad information about them now also I live here in Pittsburgh and
[01:04:07.200 --> 01:04:12.400]  Ron Paul was born here it was that never mentioned at all in the local media if
[01:04:12.400 --> 01:04:15.800]  they know I mean if they're forced to talk about him it's always negative
[01:04:15.800 --> 01:04:21.680]  yeah sure and one last point I want to make a fox news is reporting in South
[01:04:21.680 --> 01:04:27.200]  Carolina's having a closed primary and you know that's just not true either and
[01:04:27.200 --> 01:04:33.400]  I talk on YouTube now three pundits talking about you know it's a closed
[01:04:33.400 --> 01:04:38.800]  primary and whatever and that's also not true well they're running dirty tricks
[01:04:38.800 --> 01:04:43.880]  against Ron Paul a great run down there thank you so much my friend they're in a

[01:09:11.360 --> 01:09:16.080]  on the air welcome sir hey thank you Alex for having me on the show welcome
[01:09:16.080 --> 01:09:20.680]  I'm I'm a local a pawnbroker in town and a very before Christmas I was
[01:09:20.680 --> 01:09:24.080]  listening to your show at work and I had a customer come in to pawn one of his
[01:09:24.080 --> 01:09:29.360]  rifles and he happened to be a Iraq vet and one who was also in the guards right
[01:09:29.360 --> 01:09:36.440]  now and I asked him about the NBA a bill and he wanted to tell me that they say
[01:09:36.440 --> 01:09:39.280]  that there's gonna be under domestic operations within the United States
[01:09:39.280 --> 01:09:42.000]  within the next two years that's what they're said they're planning for a
[01:09:42.000 --> 01:09:45.000]  debate and they said they're gonna be doing the same types of things that he
[01:09:45.000 --> 01:09:48.520]  did in Iraq yeah well that guy thinks he's got some secret info that's
[01:09:48.520 --> 01:09:53.600]  actually Army times and the Stars and Stripes and you know they're they're
[01:09:53.600 --> 01:09:57.520]  training to lockdown cities door-to-door gun confiscation they're gonna stop you
[01:09:57.520 --> 01:10:01.040]  at checkpoints retina scan you that they've already got as I told you a
[01:10:01.040 --> 01:10:04.480]  decade ago but now it's here TSA checkpoints all over the country you
[01:10:04.480 --> 01:10:09.600]  pull up and the feds are commanding local police and in some cases hand goes
[01:10:09.600 --> 01:10:12.200]  down the pants I mean it's an active total submission
[01:10:12.200 --> 01:10:16.480]  the symbol of America shouldn't be red white and blue but it's a five-year-old
[01:10:16.480 --> 01:10:20.120]  being groped by a potbellied pedophile at a checkpoint I mean that should be the
[01:10:20.120 --> 01:10:24.240]  American flag as a pedophile groping a child for their safety of course because
[01:10:24.240 --> 01:10:27.480]  al-Qaeda might get you could of course the government war runs al-Qaeda and gave
[01:10:27.480 --> 01:10:32.040]  him control Libya but you're not supposed to talk about that but what else did he
[01:10:32.040 --> 01:10:35.640]  say was he ever pretty excited about that pretty excited about being sent out
[01:10:35.640 --> 01:10:40.040]  to get the guns which is basically a well it's like playing and in traffic on
[01:10:40.040 --> 01:10:45.000]  interstate highway absolutely not Alex he's actually Alex listener and he
[01:10:45.000 --> 01:10:49.120]  totally disagrees and so he doesn't want to stick his hand in the lion's mouth
[01:10:49.120 --> 01:10:53.040]  he doesn't want to stick his hand in a blender jump off a cliff or jump into
[01:10:53.040 --> 01:10:58.040]  propeller he actually has a brain absolutely he does have a brain and
[01:10:58.040 --> 01:11:01.960]  you know I have several friends and cousins who have been in Iraq and they're
[01:11:01.960 --> 01:11:06.440]  all waking up to they're all big Ron Paul supporters well Ron Paul does get
[01:11:06.440 --> 01:11:10.800]  last time I checked 74% of all military donations for both parties for
[01:11:10.800 --> 01:11:14.640]  presidential candidates but in the mid but in the media the so-called media
[01:11:14.640 --> 01:11:18.880]  because they're arrogant and have big teleprompters and fancy sets they say he
[01:11:18.880 --> 01:11:23.320]  that military hates Ron Paul of course he just got 70 plus percent of all their
[01:11:23.320 --> 01:11:27.680]  money and the military is waking up that's why the secret homeland security
[01:11:27.680 --> 01:11:31.440]  documents that we released now three and a half years ago that made national
[01:11:31.440 --> 01:11:35.920]  news the government admitted to theirs say they're not even talking about al-Qaeda
[01:11:35.920 --> 01:11:40.920]  they're talking about veterans as the number one enemy and the nexus
[01:11:40.920 --> 01:11:45.200]  conservatives and libertarians so all of you out there better understand the
[01:11:45.200 --> 01:11:50.160]  mega corporations want communism in America and a red terror to break your
[01:11:50.160 --> 01:11:53.880]  will and then the new government they put in will suck the money off short of
[01:11:53.880 --> 01:11:59.120]  them so you better understand the mega banks are the commies and you better
[01:11:59.120 --> 01:12:03.640]  understand they're the enemies or there's no future well that's exciting news
[01:12:03.640 --> 01:12:07.760]  that your family and folks coming in are awake that's what I'm seeing and that's
[01:12:07.760 --> 01:12:11.320]  why the globalist are a paper tiger all we got to do is call their bluff my
[01:12:11.320 --> 01:12:17.320]  friend thank you Alex thank you very much God bless you know God bless you
[01:12:17.320 --> 01:12:22.600]  Mario cuz I'm gonna tell you I was in that barbecue joint last now with my
[01:12:22.600 --> 01:12:28.320]  family to get some of that good German barbecue and I'm sitting there and I'm
[01:12:28.320 --> 01:12:33.440]  eating barbecue and I'm listening to people howl and scream and bug their
[01:12:33.440 --> 01:12:37.800]  eyes up and full grown men stand up with their fist clenched bolden bulge in
[01:12:37.800 --> 01:12:42.120]  their eyes out with veins in their neck over touchdowns and I wanted to go to
[01:12:42.120 --> 01:12:46.800]  them and I wanted to say all that male energy is to defend your family and your
[01:12:46.800 --> 01:12:52.920]  country but I knew better so see I get fired up here like I'm in a football
[01:12:52.920 --> 01:12:56.880]  game but I apologize it's not over something that doesn't matter it's over
[01:12:56.880 --> 01:13:02.520]  something that totally matters and that's why I'm in competition against
[01:13:02.520 --> 01:13:07.440]  sports for people's energy and their awakening we need all those energies you
[01:13:07.440 --> 01:13:12.120]  feel in sports that the social engineers are programming that's really for
[01:13:12.120 --> 01:13:18.120]  private property and family rights it was those energies getting excited about
[01:13:18.120 --> 01:13:24.560]  freedom that created the Republic let's jam in one more I got time Tommy in
[01:13:24.560 --> 01:13:30.960]  Kentucky you're on the air go ahead yeah thanks taking my call Alex welcome with
[01:13:30.960 --> 01:13:35.760]  the sports analogies I feel like momentum is definitely shifting I mean I
[01:13:35.760 --> 01:13:39.640]  think that's apparently Ron Paul and what the media is trying to do with him I
[01:13:39.640 --> 01:13:43.480]  mean they're doing everything they can to hold him back and I'll use another
[01:13:43.480 --> 01:13:46.280]  game changer and hold you over and maybe I don't want to shortchange you but a
[01:13:46.280 --> 01:13:52.320]  time out here exactly and Ron Paul is a new philosophy of football as they've
[01:13:52.320 --> 01:13:55.120]  had many that replace the old school that is going to be the winning
[01:13:55.120 --> 01:13:58.400]  philosophy in the future and so it doesn't matter if he doesn't win this
[01:13:58.400 --> 01:14:03.000]  Super Bowl he's developing a program and a system that is going to prove to be a
[01:14:03.000 --> 01:14:07.000]  winner in the future which is actually taking us back to the old Republic form
[01:14:07.000 --> 01:14:12.280]  and that's why playing and resisting is winning go ahead that's a clear in the
[01:14:12.280 --> 01:14:16.640]  debate that he you know he has a logic and truth behind what he's saying and
[01:14:16.640 --> 01:14:20.040]  you know you just can't compete with that and once you see the truth you can't
[01:14:20.040 --> 01:14:24.720]  turn back and away that's right lies cannot compete with the truth so how to
[01:14:24.720 --> 01:14:28.160]  how do lies win then if lies can't compete with the truth how do they win
[01:14:28.160 --> 01:14:35.080]  Tommy they don't win they don't win if you get on the field with truth the
[01:14:35.080 --> 01:14:39.400]  only time lies wins is when the truth doesn't show up or doesn't stand up you
[01:14:39.400 --> 01:14:44.160]  see that beauty that's why resistance is victory you got the truth you stand up
[01:14:44.160 --> 01:14:49.240]  you can't lose you understand absolutely have a couple suggestions for you go
[01:14:49.240 --> 01:14:54.400]  ahead my brother I was frustrated and like I don't know I guess angry at what
[01:14:54.400 --> 01:14:57.440]  they were doing with Ron Paul at first but then it hit me you know I mean
[01:14:57.440 --> 01:15:01.480]  they're giving us the tools to take them down and then there can be a heck of a
[01:15:01.480 --> 01:15:05.800]  documentary made with what they're doing to Ron Paul I mean it's just all out
[01:15:05.800 --> 01:15:09.280]  there in the open you know all you got to do is pull together the clips and you
[01:15:09.280 --> 01:15:12.200]  know we got them I mean you can totally take them down I mean they're ready to
[01:15:12.200 --> 01:15:19.640]  go and also I'd like to suggest a guest for you Richard Grove he's a buddy's
[01:15:19.640 --> 01:15:25.000]  with the Corbett report and young Irvin and I think you know studying the
[01:15:25.000 --> 01:15:28.960]  truvium and quadruvium I think that's that's a good foundation for people
[01:15:28.960 --> 01:15:32.760]  whenever they're arguing with other people I think Richard Grove has been
[01:15:32.760 --> 01:15:38.200]  on you're talking about basic Greek logic yeah yeah all that stuff I mean it's
[01:15:38.200 --> 01:15:44.920]  simple but it's super duper effective in arguing with yeah because in an age of
[01:15:44.920 --> 01:15:50.600]  universal deceit telling the truth is a revolutionary act great points my friend
[01:15:50.600 --> 01:15:56.240]  okay I got to stop with calls for now I got to hit some news but I got callers
[01:15:56.240 --> 01:16:02.480]  that are general callers and I have three little disagreeers hundreds of
[01:16:02.480 --> 01:16:06.680]  nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone this is our last
[01:16:06.680 --> 01:16:11.680]  chance to not relive history as we're finishing off this agenda they'll be
[01:16:11.680 --> 01:16:15.280]  pulling the rug from underneath the Americans at home I've turned in this
[01:16:15.280 --> 01:16:20.320]  influence on our president in Congress and they really are calling the shots I
[01:16:20.320 --> 01:16:25.720]  think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention for
[01:16:25.720 --> 01:16:30.640]  the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation the criminal offshore cartel
[01:16:30.640 --> 01:16:35.040]  held bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world
[01:16:35.040 --> 01:16:38.760]  government Tim Geithner Bernanke their arsonists they're asking for more
[01:16:38.760 --> 01:16:42.720]  matches and the Congress is saying who do we make the checkout to today seems
[01:16:42.720 --> 01:16:48.280]  like nobody does care and right now in Washington DC we have seen a fall of

[01:21:20.080 --> 01:21:24.520]  funny pace because they saw said and so we'll go to your calls then I'll get
[01:21:24.520 --> 01:21:28.680]  into the news into the next segment news then back into the regular callers but
[01:21:28.680 --> 01:21:34.240]  I will say this almost every time I take calls that disagree they never bring up
[01:21:34.240 --> 01:21:39.560]  real issues or they bring up personal issues or side issues I mean I wish it
[01:21:39.560 --> 01:21:43.560]  was about the fact that we're losing our liberties and going into tyranny and
[01:21:43.560 --> 01:21:48.120]  that's not a good idea I mean who can deny that now with the government saying
[01:21:48.120 --> 01:21:52.240]  yeah we'll arrest citizens secretly and kill you if we want I mean that's the
[01:21:52.240 --> 01:21:58.880]  essence of a corrupt government but they obviously disagree let's go to Kiwi
[01:21:58.880 --> 01:22:04.480]  land beautiful emerald isle of New Zealand to talk to Chris Chris what
[01:22:04.480 --> 01:22:13.640]  time is it in New Zealand I'm at some 12 21 p.m. so I'm p.m. yeah p.m. sorry it's
[01:22:13.640 --> 01:22:17.960]  noon but you've had so much liquor that you're not sure okay you're calling us
[01:22:17.960 --> 01:22:22.600]  from New Zealand sir go ahead yeah I'm just wondering why will this affect
[01:22:22.600 --> 01:22:27.400]  New Zealand in a way because it's all about USA for instance wasn't all about
[01:22:27.400 --> 01:22:35.120]  any other country like they say here Australia or New Zealand or Japan or
[01:22:35.120 --> 01:22:41.400]  anything it's all about America and how it's a big country are you sure it's all
[01:22:41.400 --> 01:22:45.720]  about America are you sure it's not about these other countries as well sir I'm
[01:22:45.720 --> 01:22:49.880]  gonna be honest with you all and I want to hear your point
[01:22:49.880 --> 01:22:54.040]  that before I say this I want to I want to hear your point are you saying that
[01:22:54.040 --> 01:22:59.160]  I'm not blaming America enough and I'm not pointing out that it's mainly the
[01:22:59.160 --> 01:23:03.520]  US that that is the main military muscle I mean specifically what do you
[01:23:03.520 --> 01:23:09.840]  disagree with I'm disagree that they you blame in America for everything hey
[01:23:09.840 --> 01:23:15.680]  America could have something like for a change you know why you just put a blame
[01:23:15.680 --> 01:23:21.720]  as well as not just the milk and why not any other countries as well as the
[01:23:21.720 --> 01:23:26.080]  opposite you're saying I'm blaming America and I shouldn't don't blame
[01:23:26.080 --> 01:23:32.040]  America too much see you you like I'm saying America that America that and why
[01:23:32.040 --> 01:23:36.560]  America stop stop stop stop stop I can't understand you I don't know if it's
[01:23:36.560 --> 01:23:40.000]  whether you had too much Jameson's or whatever it is but are you saying I
[01:23:40.000 --> 01:23:44.840]  blame America too much or I'm not blaming America enough you're blaming
[01:23:44.840 --> 01:23:50.520]  America too much okay that's okay okay it's the opposite sir our country
[01:23:50.520 --> 01:23:54.240]  globally is getting the blame for this new world order corporate empire when
[01:23:54.240 --> 01:23:57.760]  we're fitting the bill for the derivatives and the military and all of it
[01:23:57.760 --> 01:24:01.960]  and then getting the blame and getting none of the goodies none of the booty
[01:24:01.960 --> 01:24:06.800]  out of this I'm explaining it's a global corporate government I want my
[01:24:06.800 --> 01:24:11.200]  Republic back I I support George Washington who said don't have foreign
[01:24:11.200 --> 01:24:15.640]  entanglements I support Ron Paul who wants to get us out of all these wars
[01:24:15.640 --> 01:24:22.000]  now to you is that blaming America if I don't want to begin all these wars I'm
[01:24:22.000 --> 01:24:27.680]  yes or no because it's all about America you know you're talking all about
[01:24:27.680 --> 01:24:32.480]  America yes I know you live in America is he any other country can talk about as
[01:24:32.480 --> 01:24:37.680]  well like for instance they'd say here like Australia I want to ask you are

[01:25:15.640 --> 01:25:18.720]  people I don't know how I'm supposed to get through to him you know I take the
[01:25:18.720 --> 01:25:22.840]  disagree call some because I I mean I've never heard one that is actually
[01:25:22.840 --> 01:25:26.760]  coherent unless they're bringing up real stuff I'm wrong about which sometimes I
[01:25:26.760 --> 01:25:30.760]  get facts wrong or sometimes I'm being obnoxious and somebody points it out or
[01:25:30.760 --> 01:25:34.520]  they have a good recommendation but usually it's it's it's just all a bunch
[01:25:34.520 --> 01:25:39.280]  of personal issues or they misunderstand what I'm saying let's go to
[01:25:39.280 --> 01:25:44.480]  Christine in Texas who disagrees let's let's hear this one go ahead hi Alex
[01:25:44.480 --> 01:25:47.840]  first I have to tell you that my husband is a huge fan and he's probably
[01:25:47.840 --> 01:25:52.040]  appalled at the moment but I'm forced to listen to you every Sunday and while I
[01:25:52.040 --> 01:25:56.200]  don't necessarily have a problem with that I just wanted to let you know that
[01:25:56.200 --> 01:26:00.160]  I disagree with some of your tactics which sometimes I think clouds the
[01:26:00.160 --> 01:26:03.760]  message that you're trying to get a crime I disagree with my tactics as well I
[01:26:03.760 --> 01:26:09.120]  wish I was smarter and better and more suave but I'm sorry I'm just a hillbilly
[01:26:09.120 --> 01:26:13.000]  redneck who doesn't like tyranny and I'm like a bull in the china shop you ever
[01:26:13.000 --> 01:26:16.640]  heard the old British admiral who said damn the maneuvers and go straight at
[01:26:16.640 --> 01:26:19.840]  him but you know what that's all I can do it's like you know what forget the
[01:26:19.840 --> 01:26:23.600]  maneuvers I'm going straight at him I'm simply trying to say to you that for
[01:26:23.600 --> 01:26:29.560]  someone like me who is a baby in terms of what you're trying to put forth
[01:26:29.560 --> 01:26:33.960]  talking about animals having a life sucked out of them might be a little
[01:26:33.960 --> 01:26:39.480]  over the top I hear you I hear you but you realize there's a million dead
[01:26:39.480 --> 01:26:45.280]  Iraqis in the last 10 years well last 20s and sanctions and liberation I mean
[01:26:45.280 --> 01:26:48.520]  what about them I mean I always see whenever we put a video out of troops
[01:26:48.520 --> 01:26:51.960]  shooting some little kid for fun and they always remove the video and call it
[01:26:51.960 --> 01:26:57.400]  profane then they'll show simulated murder on TV like it's okay they just
[01:26:57.400 --> 01:27:04.640]  don't want the reality being seen and I was pointing out that they kill dogs at
[01:27:04.640 --> 01:27:08.760]  the pound in a lot more brutal way than when you go put your dog down which I
[01:27:08.760 --> 01:27:14.000]  love dogs and cats and have both and had to put many of them down my point was
[01:27:14.000 --> 01:27:18.800]  is that a lot of brutal stuff goes on behind the scenes and our country is
[01:27:18.800 --> 01:27:22.920]  being butchered but I agree with you I do say a lot of abrasive shocking stuff
[01:27:22.920 --> 01:27:29.360]  and I don't do it on purpose it's it's who I am but the final equation can you
[01:27:29.360 --> 01:27:34.680]  argue with success Christine you are an incredibly successful person it's my
[01:27:34.680 --> 01:27:41.200]  sincere hope that the things that you speak about will be stopped or proved
[01:27:41.200 --> 01:27:45.360]  to be untrue exactly and I've got a scream bloody murder to get people to
[01:27:45.360 --> 01:27:49.560]  pay attention so hopefully you know if I make enough of a spectacle out of this
[01:27:49.560 --> 01:27:53.040]  it's gonna get people's attention and I never knew because I didn't have a
[01:27:53.040 --> 01:27:57.240]  method to my madness this is who I am but luckily who I am naturally because
[01:27:57.240 --> 01:28:01.800]  it's not an act actually works to get people's attention and so who God made
[01:28:01.800 --> 01:28:07.440]  me naturally you know guts eyeballs hair and all that has actually had an
[01:28:07.440 --> 01:28:10.840]  effect I appreciate your call let's go to one more of the disagrees Brian in
[01:28:10.840 --> 01:28:17.520]  New York go ahead Brian hey there Alex hey buddy I'm outraged okay go ahead

[01:28:37.880 --> 01:28:42.120]  bucket on the side of the treadmill no I ran on the road and I actually ran
[01:28:42.120 --> 01:28:46.720]  upstairs and a treadmill today you want to total it all up but I don't know how
[01:28:46.720 --> 01:28:51.680]  that's disagreeing point is I've lost 30 plus pounds so it's not about how I ran
[01:28:51.680 --> 01:28:56.400]  the miles I'm losing the pounds that's what matters you see personal

[01:33:35.600 --> 01:33:41.520]  over bear creek i covered some of the news in the opening segment but you

[01:34:09.880 --> 01:34:13.480]  lady made one about me pointing out how they really kill dogs at the pound i
[01:34:13.480 --> 01:34:17.240]  meant that to go get the dogs out of the pound or spade and neuter your animals
[01:34:17.240 --> 01:34:22.840]  i didn't mean that to be mean you know what that stuff's going on at the pound
[01:34:22.840 --> 01:34:28.920]  at the dog shelter whether i talk about it or not there's this idea that i talk
[01:34:28.920 --> 01:34:31.800]  about something and then it makes it become real
[01:34:31.800 --> 01:34:37.080]  no no no no no no no no no no no people think that if they believe something
[01:34:37.080 --> 01:34:39.880]  that makes it real but if they say it isn't true
[01:34:39.880 --> 01:34:45.480]  i've had people look at me and say i choose not to believe that
[01:34:45.480 --> 01:34:48.840]  i was deer hunting well i wasn't deer hunting i was at our family's ranch and
[01:34:48.840 --> 01:34:52.600]  they had some deer hunters there who were leasing part of the property

[01:35:35.000 --> 01:35:38.920]  and i'm sitting there talking to the guy and i go okay well here's my iPhone
[01:35:38.920 --> 01:35:41.880]  it's got cell let me pull up and we're all

[01:35:45.480 --> 01:35:49.480]  secretly with a pentagon or let me pull up the libyan rebels being al-qaeda
[01:35:49.480 --> 01:35:53.000]  so i start showing it to him and after about 20 minutes he goes
[01:35:53.000 --> 01:35:56.840]  alex do you believe in god and i said yeah
[01:35:56.840 --> 01:36:00.600]  and he said uh do you believe in your faith because some stuff in the bible
[01:36:00.600 --> 01:36:04.360]  has been disproven but still i believe in jesus
[01:36:04.360 --> 01:36:09.320]  so i'm not going to look at your facts i choose to believe that isn't true
[01:36:09.320 --> 01:36:13.080]  and i said well who were you to say the bible has even been disproven
[01:36:13.080 --> 01:36:17.880]  i mean he's saying this is an article of faith for me
[01:36:17.880 --> 01:36:22.360]  and i am saying i'm not gonna look at this evidence
[01:36:22.360 --> 01:36:25.960]  and i was giving him one one millionth of it literally
[01:36:25.960 --> 01:36:30.920]  that's like oh you just want to engage me
[01:36:30.920 --> 01:36:37.400]  and you want to have a debate with me about something
[01:36:37.400 --> 01:36:41.320]  but you don't actually want to have the debate as soon as you realize i've got
[01:36:41.320 --> 01:36:44.680]  my facts i know what i'm talking about
[01:36:44.680 --> 01:36:49.480]  you don't want to hear it and no america didn't stage 9 11
[01:36:49.480 --> 01:36:54.760]  no your cousin who's a marine corps sergeant didn't stage it
[01:36:54.760 --> 01:37:00.280]  criminal globalist infiltrators that fund the radical muslims
[01:37:00.280 --> 01:37:04.120]  on record stage the attacks opened the door
[01:37:04.120 --> 01:37:07.160]  ran the whole deal i've proven it up one side and down the other
[01:37:07.160 --> 01:37:11.160]  i've interviewed the heads of the u.s embassy who were told let
[01:37:11.160 --> 01:37:15.880]  and we're all you know let muhammadatta let them all back into the u.s
[01:37:15.880 --> 01:37:19.880]  they're really u.s government agents i've interviewed the lawyer
[01:37:19.880 --> 01:37:22.920]  who saw the u.s government getting the underwear bomber on the plane two
[01:37:22.920 --> 01:37:26.760]  Christmases ago he's been on this show
[01:37:26.760 --> 01:37:29.880]  and months later the u.s government congress admitted we were ordered to
[01:37:29.880 --> 01:37:32.840]  help get him on the plane by an unnamed u.s agency the state
[01:37:32.840 --> 01:37:36.360]  department said those are facts that don't change
[01:37:36.360 --> 01:37:43.320]  not one but two passports from those aircraft that hit those buildings on
[01:37:43.320 --> 01:37:46.760]  9 11 went through their suits through the fireball
[01:37:46.760 --> 01:37:49.960]  through the millions of papers through the feet of dust and fire
[01:37:49.960 --> 01:37:55.400]  and were found that day by the fbi
[01:37:55.400 --> 01:38:02.200]  that's a total setup they might as well found a lucky charms leprechaun down
[01:38:02.200 --> 01:38:07.720]  there is fine the two passports undamaged in the rubble
[01:38:07.720 --> 01:38:13.240]  it's a frame up muhammadatta's bag didn't go through
[01:38:13.240 --> 01:38:16.680]  the checkout properly and was found with all the admissions and
[01:38:16.680 --> 01:38:20.920]  and the and the flight uniforms and the maps and the confessions
[01:38:20.920 --> 01:38:24.680]  they found me come on man
[01:38:25.160 --> 01:38:29.400]  you ever heard of a frame up you ever heard of us and you're like well why
[01:38:29.400 --> 01:38:33.560]  would they do that let me play you a clip here
[01:38:33.560 --> 01:38:37.000]  i know i told you guys have a daily show ready first then make it from the
[01:38:37.000 --> 01:38:39.880]  police state and secret arrest but but give me sand
[01:38:39.880 --> 01:38:47.720]  torum first pool former senator rick sin torum uh where he says
[01:38:47.720 --> 01:38:51.080]  we'll kill anybody we want without warrants without law
[01:38:51.080 --> 01:38:55.000]  without anything anytime he goes we're killing us citizens
[01:38:55.000 --> 01:38:59.240]  a lucky the guy who's admitted cia and who i predicted you'd have a
[01:38:59.240 --> 01:39:02.760]  stage killing of once you took him out of circulation
[01:39:02.760 --> 01:39:06.120]  this is the guy who hangs out at the pentagon secretly the head of the
[01:39:06.120 --> 01:39:10.600]  seven seven bombing it came out in the london telegraph bbc and fox news was
[01:39:10.600 --> 01:39:13.960]  mi6 i mean i'm not the one making this stuff up i
[01:39:13.960 --> 01:39:18.120]  wish it was a bunch of crazy muslims and caves doing it this is a lot
[01:39:18.120 --> 01:39:21.880]  less scarier than uncle sam being a crazy eyed
[01:39:21.880 --> 01:39:27.320]  murdering terrorist but uncle sam works for the foreign banks now
[01:39:27.320 --> 01:39:33.160]  same folks stealing grandma's pension fund okay
[01:39:33.160 --> 01:39:36.760]  listen i wish every day it'd be so much fun
[01:39:36.760 --> 01:39:40.600]  to just be scared of cavemen in afghanistan
[01:39:40.600 --> 01:39:47.880]  but it's not true so i can't do it i can't be a liar i can't be a sellout i
[01:39:47.880 --> 01:39:52.440]  can't do it i have to live in the real world
[01:39:52.440 --> 01:39:56.760]  now here's sand torum giving a speech just two days ago he's real proud of
[01:39:56.760 --> 01:40:01.000]  himself about killing citizens
[01:40:01.000 --> 01:40:04.760]  then you know they don't they're in the process of developing nuclear weapons
[01:40:04.760 --> 01:40:09.240]  and it appears obvious to me that the administration is doing little to nothing
[01:40:09.240 --> 01:40:13.480]  now i'm hopeful that some of the things we're seeing with respect to the
[01:40:13.480 --> 01:40:16.840]  nuclear program that the united states is involved with
[01:40:16.840 --> 01:40:22.760]  which is on occasion scientists working on the nuclear program in iran turn up
[01:40:22.760 --> 01:40:26.920]  dead i think that's a wonderful thing
[01:40:26.920 --> 01:40:31.560]  can oh yeah very clear message that if you were a scientist
[01:40:31.560 --> 01:40:35.160]  from russia or from north korea or from iran and you're going to work on the
[01:40:35.160 --> 01:40:38.760]  nuclear program to develop a nuclear bomb from iran you are not safe
[01:40:38.760 --> 01:40:42.200]  okay and if people say well you can't go out and assassinate people
[01:40:42.200 --> 01:40:46.600]  will tell that that'll walk okay we've done it we've done it for an american
[01:40:46.600 --> 01:40:50.600]  citizen we can certainly do it for someone who's producing a nuclear bomb
[01:40:50.600 --> 01:40:53.800]  that can be dropped on the state of israel or provides a nuclear shield for
[01:40:53.800 --> 01:40:59.320]  a country that yeah but israel has hundreds of nuclear weapons
[01:40:59.320 --> 01:41:03.800]  now again you hear all the weak men in that room
[01:41:03.800 --> 01:41:07.480]  who think killing is tough they never killed anybody
[01:41:07.480 --> 01:41:10.920]  like their problem is they didn't grow up in a rough part of town and get beat
[01:41:10.920 --> 01:41:14.600]  up every day that they think violence is tough
[01:41:14.600 --> 01:41:19.400]  they think it's cute they think it's sexy
[01:41:19.400 --> 01:41:26.520]  they're all giggling what happens when iran starts killing
[01:41:27.800 --> 01:41:31.720]  us government people oh it's going to be the end of the world how dare them
[01:41:31.720 --> 01:41:35.160]  and iran has now said they're going to respond to the us and israel by trying
[01:41:35.160 --> 01:41:39.320]  to kill people but you'll then start a huge war that'll bring russia and
[01:41:39.320 --> 01:41:42.440]  china and probably and we're off to the races
[01:41:42.440 --> 01:41:46.120]  you know he just sits up there and says oh and people you know whole military
[01:41:46.120 --> 01:41:50.360]  bases are getting bombs dropped on them police stations are being blown up
[01:41:50.360 --> 01:41:54.280]  people are being shot and killed and bombed
[01:41:54.280 --> 01:41:59.560]  he likes that he thinks that's a good thing some little soft chicken hawk
[01:41:59.560 --> 01:42:03.720]  nobody picking on a country of 76 million people
[01:42:03.720 --> 01:42:07.000]  that haven't been under 20 years of sanctions like the iraqis
[01:42:07.000 --> 01:42:10.440]  and are who are going to fight back
[01:42:11.320 --> 01:42:15.240]  but notice when they were first trying to pass the national defense
[01:42:15.240 --> 01:42:19.480]  authorization act last year the obama signed december 31st
[01:42:19.480 --> 01:42:26.040]  2011 if they said don't worry it doesn't affect citizens in the aclu myself
[01:42:26.040 --> 01:42:29.960]  ron paul others said well it says right here affects us citizens secret arrest
[01:42:29.960 --> 01:42:34.600]  we can disappear and they said no it didn't
[01:42:34.600 --> 01:42:37.960]  soon as they passed it though they said you bet it does and they had all these
[01:42:37.960 --> 01:42:42.440]  creepy senators sweating and hopping around like they were
[01:42:42.440 --> 01:42:46.360]  on methamphetamine say on c-span you bet it's for

[01:48:53.720 --> 01:49:02.200]  barack obama ah barack obama the socialist muslim kenyan christian
[01:49:03.560 --> 01:49:07.560]  i wonder what permanent damage he's done to our country from his laboratory of power grabbing
[01:49:08.200 --> 01:49:11.560]  that he inhabits between the small window between christmas and new years he's so
[01:49:11.560 --> 01:49:16.680]  dangerous in his last official act of the year the vacation president obama
[01:49:16.680 --> 01:49:22.360]  signed the 662 billion dollar military spending bill in hawaii that allows the military to
[01:49:22.360 --> 01:49:28.040]  indefinitely uh detain terror suspects including american citizens in the us
[01:49:30.920 --> 01:49:31.800]  who needs trials
[01:49:34.920 --> 01:49:40.120]  i was kidding about the damage i was ironically portraying a character who believes the president
[01:49:40.120 --> 01:49:47.480]  is exercising executive power in an unwarranted fashion creating humor through the juxtaposition
[01:49:49.000 --> 01:49:53.320]  it's not funny steward for the last thing the president did in 2011 was sign of bill
[01:49:53.880 --> 01:49:58.600]  that pretty much does away with due process for anyone suspected of terrorism in america no
[01:49:58.600 --> 01:50:03.080]  no wonder he signed it on new year's eve the one night the media's most tenacious reporter
[01:50:03.080 --> 01:50:11.240]  mr keepin them honest would be completely distracted there was some comedian half naked
[01:50:12.520 --> 01:50:17.800]  anderson cooper couldn't keep the president honest they couldn't even keep gathie griffin's shirt off
[01:50:17.800 --> 01:50:28.760]  is he cia look it up still a big joke still i cannot believe barack obama signed that provision
[01:50:28.760 --> 01:50:36.120]  the president signed it reluctantly oh well now i didn't know i wanted to realize that i didn't
[01:50:36.120 --> 01:50:41.640]  know that as as long as he signed the bill allowing for americans indefinite detention
[01:50:41.640 --> 01:50:48.680]  while sighing perhaps he included an appropriate emoticon with his signature folks this isn't
[01:50:48.680 --> 01:50:53.480]  going to be funny soon this is all about taking your pension funds get ready get ready folks i'm
[01:50:53.480 --> 01:50:58.520]  so i don't want you to not have a lawyer but get ready folks they're doing this for a reason actually
[01:50:58.520 --> 01:51:03.640]  when signing the bill the president issued a signing statement presidential expression of
[01:51:03.640 --> 01:51:08.920]  objection or interpretation which said in part although this bill authorizes the government
[01:51:08.920 --> 01:51:14.360]  to detain americans indefinitely well i'll let him finish my administration will not
[01:51:14.360 --> 01:51:23.480]  authorize the indefinite military detention without trial of american citizens who say presidents can
[01:51:23.480 --> 01:51:31.560]  but he won't which is great since he'll always be president since he lies he said he would veto
[01:51:31.560 --> 01:51:41.080]  the bill i know that voice get my elbow oh my god get my what are you doing here
[01:51:41.080 --> 01:51:47.720]  yeah oh it's real funny isn't it all right that's enough that's enough it goes on and on
[01:51:47.720 --> 01:51:49.640]  hold things up and info wars dot com
[01:51:52.840 --> 01:51:56.760]  obama said he was going to veto that bill so we couldn't form opposition against it
[01:51:56.760 --> 01:52:02.440]  i told you that three weeks before he signed it i told you it affected citizens they said it didn't
[01:52:02.440 --> 01:52:08.200]  these are all tactics to make sure you never wake up and get involved then i've got a whole
[01:52:08.200 --> 01:52:13.240]  stack of news here i you know i see these type of news articles every day this is out of the montreal
[01:52:13.240 --> 01:52:18.680]  gazette radioactive iodine and rainwater this is new radioactive iodine only last eight days
[01:52:19.560 --> 01:52:26.120]  this type uh very carcinogenic though because the Fukushima is still melting down just that's in
[01:52:26.120 --> 01:52:31.000]  the canadian papers and it basically goes on to say the government has covered that up so has our
[01:52:31.000 --> 01:52:38.440]  government used to they didn't know uh here's another one prosecutor says captain left ship
[01:52:38.440 --> 01:52:45.640]  early this is out of uh us today yeah instead of uh just actually helping the folks it took
[01:52:45.640 --> 01:52:51.640]  about 10 hours for the ship finally sunk partially the main crew and the captain just evacuated
[01:52:51.640 --> 01:52:58.040]  themselves first captains never really acted like that previously the captain of the titanic
[01:52:58.040 --> 01:53:04.920]  went down with it but i mean nowadays they just you know so what again it's a society where nobody
[01:53:05.480 --> 01:53:11.560]  cares anymore i don't worry though universal flu vaccine could be available in 2013 never
[01:53:11.560 --> 01:53:16.360]  mind the fact these companies have been given liability protection so so what how many people
[01:53:16.360 --> 01:53:23.000]  they kill are main here's another one the link between process meat and uh cancer uh the british
[01:53:23.000 --> 01:53:28.360]  journal of cancer reports that to all of those things that keep the meat from rotting actually
[01:53:28.360 --> 01:53:33.400]  rocks your pancreas and your colon and it's giving you cancer turns out you should eat fresh meat
[01:53:33.400 --> 01:53:38.680]  not process meat and it could be that virus for a decade they've been spraying on meat that each
[01:53:38.680 --> 01:53:43.960]  bacteria uh is also causing cancer oh yeah they spray a live vaccine on most of your cold cuts
[01:53:45.000 --> 01:53:50.520]  and that's a british journal of cancer so what though hey who doesn't like a case of colon cancer
[01:53:50.520 --> 01:53:56.360]  or pancreas cancer i mean don't listen to me i'm a conspiracy theorist uh that's just some of the
