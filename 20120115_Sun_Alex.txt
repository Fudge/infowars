[00:00:07.471 --> 00:00:11.852]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:00:11.852 --> 00:00:17.433]  It's Alex Jones coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWar.
[00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:38.313]  Welcome my friends welcome and thank you so much for joining us on this live Sunday the
[00:00:44.139 --> 00:01:06.699]  15th day of January 2012 we're going to be live here for the next two hours and what I'm going to do today is something to shake the show up a bit not because the show isn't exploding by leaps and bounds and breaking all previous records but I still don't want to become stagnant here I want to open the phones up
[00:01:09.281 --> 00:01:20.871]  At about 20 after or so today and take phone calls pretty much in the first hour and then get into more of the news in the second hour.
[00:01:20.871 --> 00:01:23.813]  And so without further ado, I'm going to give the phone number out right now.
[00:01:23.813 --> 00:01:26.795]  You guys got the phone system open and ready to roll.
[00:01:26.795 --> 00:01:29.378]  Fantastic.
[00:01:29.378 --> 00:01:36.824]  On any issue you want to mention the Iran situation, European countries losing their debt credit rating.
[00:01:38.391 --> 00:01:40.832]  IBM announcing the cashless society.
[00:01:40.832 --> 00:01:42.853]  Retina scanning to buy and sell.
[00:01:42.853 --> 00:01:47.556]  Bev Harris has got big news on potential election fraud going on.
[00:01:47.556 --> 00:01:52.878]  Ron Paul surging.
[00:01:52.878 --> 00:01:56.500]  That's just some of the news we've got coming up today.
[00:01:56.500 --> 00:02:06.385]  Also, I want to get into the fact that Stephen Colbert is talking about running for president to kind of make things a joke he's putting out.
[00:02:07.296 --> 00:02:07.676]  I don't
[00:02:16.109 --> 00:02:17.350]  Comedy people.
[00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:27.478]  But a lot of times they can tell more truth as comics than the bought-and-paid-for globalist ABC, NBC, CBS, Fox, CNN can do.
[00:02:27.478 --> 00:02:32.021]  But still, it pretty much has the same goal in the final equation.
[00:02:32.021 --> 00:02:37.805]  A week or so ago, they had a report on the National Defense Authorization Act, and I meant to play it.
[00:02:37.805 --> 00:02:39.246]  We're going to play it today.
[00:02:39.246 --> 00:02:39.887]  Jon Stewart.
[00:02:41.072 --> 00:02:42.713]  Makes jokes about it.
[00:02:42.713 --> 00:02:46.776]  It's not a laughing matter, the end of the Bill of Rights, the end of the Constitution.
[00:02:46.776 --> 00:02:52.839]  This is earth-shattering type stuff that is happening, so we're going to get to that first.
[00:02:52.839 --> 00:03:02.506]  But the total free number to join us on air, here, on the Sunday transmission is 877-789-ALEX-877-789-2539.
[00:03:09.454 --> 00:03:22.219]  And we don't screen your calls, but if you'd like to tell us some of the basics, maybe one line of what you're calling it about, or one word that, like, I disagree, then you go to the head of the line.
[00:03:22.219 --> 00:03:25.281]  The toll-free number, again, is 877-789-2539, here on this live Sunday edition.
[00:03:31.531 --> 00:03:33.191]  Obviously big developments.
[00:03:33.191 --> 00:03:36.412]  Every day there's huge developments in the economy.
[00:03:36.412 --> 00:03:45.715]  In Iran, in Syria, Russia is saying they take it as a military threat to their national interest if Syria or Iran are struck.
[00:03:45.715 --> 00:03:53.857]  Within a day of Russia saying that, the United States cancelled its drill, administrative hormuzh, menacing Iranian forces.
[00:03:55.231 --> 00:04:09.921]  So, still the Russkies and their big ICBM baseball bat have some effect because the Russians are not known to make threats without being ready to follow through with them.
[00:04:09.921 --> 00:04:14.705]  In fact, even during the Cuban Missile Crisis, they were not threatening to use nuclear weapons.
[00:04:14.705 --> 00:04:21.470]  When the United States backed Jordan forces with NATO attack, Russian-held Abkhazia and South Ossetia
[00:04:22.455 --> 00:04:27.065]  The Russians did roll in medium-range mobile missile launchers.
[00:04:27.065 --> 00:04:31.535]  Their Chairman of Joint Chiefs of Staff did come out and he said...
[00:04:32.782 --> 00:04:34.703]  If you don't stop landing U.S.
[00:04:34.703 --> 00:04:39.967]  troops and NATO troops at these airports, we're going to fire nuclear weapons at you.
[00:04:39.967 --> 00:04:46.291]  Needless to say, Cheney blinked, bionic heart and all, and they loaded the troops back up on the aircraft.
[00:04:46.291 --> 00:04:50.554]  But they still engaged in a probing exercise.
[00:04:50.554 --> 00:04:55.298]  I guess it's old wicked men, it's the only thing that gets their hearts beating.
[00:04:55.298 --> 00:04:56.699]  We'll be right back, stay with us.
[00:04:59.124 --> 00:05:00.426]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[00:05:00.426 --> 00:05:06.014]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[00:05:06.014 --> 00:05:11.041]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds could become more valuable than silver or gold?
[00:05:11.041 --> 00:05:16.068]  It's true, seeds had outperformed even gold and silver before in this country, and it's possible they could even happen again.
[00:05:16.588 --> 00:05:21.812]  So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds.
[00:05:21.812 --> 00:05:28.936]  They call it a survival seed bank, and it can produce an endless supply of nutrient-dense food for you and your family.
[00:05:28.936 --> 00:05:30.057]  And here's the best part.
[00:05:30.057 --> 00:05:36.421]  These seeds have not been genetically modified in any way, and you actually get enough seeds to plant a full acre crisis garden.
[00:05:36.741 --> 00:05:39.924]  So visit them today at survivalseedbank.com.
[00:05:39.924 --> 00:05:42.146]  That's survivalseedbank.com.
[00:05:42.146 --> 00:05:43.087]  Or give them a call at 877-327-0365.
[00:05:43.087 --> 00:05:43.287]  That's 877-327-0365.
[00:05:43.287 --> 00:05:46.731]  Remember, in a real crisis, non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item.
[00:05:46.731 --> 00:05:48.472]  This is Alex Jones for survivalseedbank.com.
[00:06:03.402 --> 00:06:09.966]  You are listening to an InfoWars.com Frontline Report.
[00:06:09.966 --> 00:06:21.513]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[00:06:21.513 --> 00:06:30.158]  From deep in the heart of FEMA Region 6, Austin, Texas, transmitting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[00:06:38.208 --> 00:06:53.851]  Welcome my friends, welcome to all of you out there listening on the AM and FM dial via the internet at InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.tv and those listening on Global Shortwave as well as the weekday radio listeners that listen on XM.
[00:06:53.851 --> 00:06:57.032]  Thank you so much for joining us.
[00:06:57.032 --> 00:07:05.754]  While others are watching football this Sunday afternoon and while others are going to the topless bars or
[00:07:07.114 --> 00:07:08.455]  Doing whatever people do.
[00:07:08.455 --> 00:07:15.479]  We are here live on the radio and a lot of you are listening to us as well.
[00:07:15.479 --> 00:07:24.604]  Because we understand that the future of human civilization is in the balance right now and is being decided.
[00:07:27.219 --> 00:07:31.402]  And the tyrannies that we face as a society are not a joke.
[00:07:31.402 --> 00:07:49.493]  In every case in history, when governments remove checks and balances, remove the common right of the people, and assail the right of the family and property and the right of self-defense, giant wars, subjugation, enslavement, always, invariably follow.
[00:07:52.247 --> 00:08:01.253]  And we can see that we are on that road to perdition, that road to tyranny, that road to oppression, that road to bondage, serfdom, slavery.
[00:08:01.253 --> 00:08:14.802]  We are being usurped by highly competitive combines of megacorporations that control government and are anti-free market, what is known as crony, monopoly, capitalist.
[00:08:15.242 --> 00:08:21.648]  Who use socialism and fascism and other forms of command and control to control populations.
[00:08:21.648 --> 00:08:23.270]  Now here's what I'm going to do.
[00:08:23.270 --> 00:08:25.332]  Shaking the show up.
[00:08:25.332 --> 00:08:35.883]  We're going to start going to your phone calls in the next segment today and then I'll do the main news in the first 30 minutes of the next hour and then go back in to your calls.
[00:08:37.421 --> 00:08:39.623]  Coming up in the second hour, U.S.
[00:08:39.623 --> 00:08:41.324]  warns Israel on strike.
[00:08:41.324 --> 00:08:46.627]  Officials lobby against attack on Iran as military leaders bolster defense.
[00:08:46.627 --> 00:08:47.388]  15,000 U.S.
[00:08:47.388 --> 00:08:51.611]  troops additionally are added to the Kuwait forces.
[00:08:51.611 --> 00:08:52.711]  More than 2,000 U.S.
[00:08:52.711 --> 00:08:56.174]  troops now on the ground in Israel.
[00:08:56.174 --> 00:09:03.439]  Jericho, medium-range ICBMs, nuclear-tipped, are fueled on the Israeli tarmac and gantries.
[00:09:04.384 --> 00:09:06.205]  Iran says it has evidence the U.S.
[00:09:06.205 --> 00:09:12.089]  is behind scientists' killing, along with the other now-admitted covert war inside Iran.
[00:09:12.089 --> 00:09:14.771]  Haratz out of Israel reports Israel and U.S.
[00:09:14.771 --> 00:09:20.575]  postpone massive defense drill in fear of escalation with Iran.
[00:09:20.575 --> 00:09:27.040]  Iran, until about two weeks ago, has denied their bases are getting blown up and all this is happening because it makes them look weak.
[00:09:27.040 --> 00:09:28.941]  Now their public knows they've got
[00:09:30.441 --> 00:09:35.966]  Forces all over their country, including four Al-Qaeda groups, blowing up dams, shooting police.
[00:09:35.966 --> 00:09:38.307]  Of course, Al-Qaeda works for the banks that run the U.S.
[00:09:38.307 --> 00:09:42.671]  They've been given Libya, Amr al-Awlaki, the former number three in Al-Qaeda.
[00:09:42.671 --> 00:09:44.132]  They claim they've killed now.
[00:09:44.132 --> 00:09:46.174]  I predicted they would have a staged killing of him when it came out.
[00:09:46.174 --> 00:09:49.637]  He really worked for the CIA and the Pentagon, as Fox News reported.
[00:09:50.987 --> 00:09:53.288]  But Israel and U.S.
[00:09:53.288 --> 00:09:56.730]  postponed massive defense drill in fear of escalation with Iran.
[00:09:56.730 --> 00:10:02.254]  They were later next week to have ships steam right up, Israeli and U.S.
[00:10:02.254 --> 00:10:05.055]  ships, right up to the Iranian ships.
[00:10:05.055 --> 00:10:11.239]  And the Iranians had said, as you know, a week and a half ago, OK, go ahead and come back through with your fleet.
[00:10:11.239 --> 00:10:12.600]  This is your only warning.
[00:10:12.600 --> 00:10:13.380]  Don't do it.
[00:10:13.380 --> 00:10:14.541]  We are going to attack you.
[00:10:17.370 --> 00:10:22.131]  And the Iranians are well known, they do not make threats.
[00:10:22.131 --> 00:10:23.431]  They don't make threats.
[00:10:23.431 --> 00:10:25.892]  If they tell you they're going to do something, they pretty much do it.
[00:10:25.892 --> 00:10:27.032]  Same thing with the Russians.
[00:10:27.032 --> 00:10:30.653]  And again, I'm not on the side of the Russians or side of the Iranians.
[00:10:30.653 --> 00:10:32.393]  I'm giving you facts here.
[00:10:32.393 --> 00:10:39.335]  Not what I want to think or what I want to believe geopolitically or analyzing different countries as I do with my obsession with reality.
[00:10:41.087 --> 00:10:43.089]  But what will happen?
[00:10:43.089 --> 00:10:45.010]  The Russians do not make threats.
[00:10:45.010 --> 00:10:48.073]  They didn't during the Cuban Missile Crisis use nuclear weapons.
[00:10:48.073 --> 00:11:02.425]  They did in 2008 on 888 when the Olympics kicked off when Cheney decided, that was later declassified, through NATO to launch a sneak attack on South Ossetia and Abkhazia in Georgia, Russian-controlled areas.
[00:11:04.767 --> 00:11:05.287]  As U.S.
[00:11:05.287 --> 00:11:14.050]  forces began to land en masse to back up the Georgians, the head of the Russian Joint Chiefs of Staff, who was all over BBC, wasn't on U.S.
[00:11:14.050 --> 00:11:21.793]  TV, went out and gave a speech and said, we have rolled missile launchers in with medium-range nukes on the big trucks.
[00:11:21.793 --> 00:11:24.374]  We're preparing to fire them at Georgian bases.
[00:11:25.393 --> 00:11:27.814]  You have 12 hours to pull out, and the U.S.
[00:11:27.814 --> 00:11:28.594]  pulled out.
[00:11:28.594 --> 00:11:34.296]  Now, you have to ask yourself, why is our government trying to start World War III with the Russians?
[00:11:34.296 --> 00:11:45.559]  Why are they trying to start the shutdown of the Strait of Hormuz with the Iranians, when China says that is a military attack on them, that's their ally, and where they get 20% of their oil?
[00:11:45.559 --> 00:11:50.881]  The Russians say that's on their doorstep, because Iran does border Russia.
[00:11:50.881 --> 00:11:53.402]  And you notice the United States announced this about
[00:11:54.420 --> 00:12:19.512]  What, 15 hours or so ago, that they're going to stop and cancel this big naval engagement with the Iranians, basically, that now the Russians have come out and said, well, here's the headline from RT, which is Russian television, Russia Today, should anything happen to Iran, this will be a direct threat to our national security.
[00:12:20.623 --> 00:12:22.303]  They said the same thing on Iran.
[00:12:22.303 --> 00:12:25.784]  The full quote and video of their foreign minister is there.
[00:12:25.784 --> 00:12:27.244]  And so he tells the U.S.
[00:12:27.244 --> 00:12:31.185]  yesterday, listen, if you attack them, it's an attack on us.
[00:12:31.185 --> 00:12:33.125]  It's an attack on our sovereignty.
[00:12:33.125 --> 00:12:40.087]  And suddenly the fleet's cruising right up to the Iranians and all the war talk stops.
[00:12:40.087 --> 00:12:46.168]  Because now China and Russia are signaling that they are going to take this as an attack on them.
[00:12:48.547 --> 00:12:51.848]  Now, could it be a bluff?
[00:12:51.848 --> 00:12:55.889]  Chinese don't bluff either, folks.
[00:12:55.889 --> 00:12:59.150]  It's kind of like the walk-softly-carry-a-big-stick.
[00:12:59.150 --> 00:13:04.531]  It's not China racing around the world invading all these countries and bombing people and doing all this.
[00:13:04.531 --> 00:13:06.712]  China's taking over their economic development.
[00:13:06.712 --> 00:13:11.713]  And by the way, I don't like the Communist Chinese leadership and all their fat generals shucking off the Chinese people.
[00:13:12.492 --> 00:13:14.633]  I don't like the corruption in Russia.
[00:13:14.633 --> 00:13:16.214]  I don't like who runs Iran.
[00:13:16.214 --> 00:13:20.196]  The point is, America isn't run by America either.
[00:13:20.196 --> 00:13:33.424]  America is run by the Fortune 100 megabanks, the six big megabanks that finance the Fortune 100, who have gotten the United States and Europe to sign on to their $1,500 trillion.
[00:13:33.424 --> 00:13:38.206]  The Washington Post says $646 trillion.
[00:13:38.206 --> 00:13:40.728]  Six hundred plus trillion of that is, quote, our debt.
[00:13:41.442 --> 00:13:48.269]  Now the American people, in government, only owe $15 trillion, $100 and something billion.
[00:13:48.269 --> 00:13:48.610]  What is it?
[00:13:48.610 --> 00:13:50.672]  $15.143 trillion.
[00:13:50.672 --> 00:13:53.836]  You can go look it up.
[00:13:53.836 --> 00:13:55.277]  That's the latest number as of Friday.
[00:13:55.277 --> 00:13:56.899]  $15 trillion, .143.
[00:13:56.899 --> 00:13:57.339]  $143 bill.
[00:14:03.334 --> 00:14:13.656]  And I'm told I'm in debt and I've got to have my taxes raised and everything cut with potholes everywhere because I'm in debt and I didn't pay enough taxes, I didn't work enough.
[00:14:13.656 --> 00:14:16.797]  Truth is, our country's incredibly wealthy, folks.
[00:14:16.797 --> 00:14:22.198]  But almost all the tax money now goes in banker bailouts that aren't really banker bailouts.
[00:14:22.198 --> 00:14:27.298]  The mega banks get the government to sign on to their 600 plus trillion, just for the U.S.
[00:14:27.298 --> 00:14:28.119]  alone.
[00:14:28.119 --> 00:14:29.819]  Globally, it's 1.5 trillion and growing.
[00:14:31.134 --> 00:14:33.395]  And I know I say this every week because it's so important.
[00:14:33.395 --> 00:14:35.036]  It's the answer to the riddle.
[00:14:35.036 --> 00:14:37.697]  It's why all this is happening.
[00:14:37.697 --> 00:14:51.342]  And then they say, OK, we got to raise your taxes and cut everything and have the age of austerity and cut the military and cut everything because everything's got to go to the bankers.
[00:14:51.342 --> 00:14:59.606]  And then the bankers themselves, the big mega banks, blame the free market so they can use government to knock out all their competition when this is not free market that did all of this.
[00:15:03.700 --> 00:15:05.961]  Now here's the Russian Foreign Minister.
[00:15:05.961 --> 00:15:08.723]  Iran is our close neighbor just south of the Caucasus.
[00:15:08.723 --> 00:15:17.908]  Should anything happen to Iran, should Iran get drawn into any political or military hardships, this will be a direct threat to our national security.
[00:15:17.908 --> 00:15:19.549]  And that's the, there's two quotes here.
[00:15:19.549 --> 00:15:24.752]  That's Dmitry Rogozin, Russian Deputy Prime Minister and former envoy to NATO.
[00:15:24.752 --> 00:15:26.613]  And there's another quote in here by their foreign
[00:15:28.836 --> 00:15:31.618]  There's a whole bunch of these quotes.
[00:15:31.618 --> 00:15:33.579]  I mean, this is dangerous.
[00:15:33.579 --> 00:15:36.881]  And just like World War I or World War II, it's not even a big news item.
[00:15:36.881 --> 00:15:42.945]  People are talking about this cruise ship sinking in the Mediterranean off the coast of Italy and five dead.
[00:15:42.945 --> 00:15:47.608]  They're talking about, you know, the Washington Redskins, the San Francisco 49ers.
[00:15:48.749 --> 00:15:56.733]  And then meanwhile, folks, if there's a war with Iran, bare minimum you're paying $7 a gallon for gas in a couple weeks.
[00:15:56.733 --> 00:16:01.255]  Alright, your phone call's coming up, then the big news.
[00:16:01.255 --> 00:16:15.703]  You've heard Alex explain how the Silver Lungs Generator infuses the respiratory system with your self-produced colloidal silver solutions, yet many are unaware of the entire function of the Silver Lungs System and how it has been designed to deliver your silver solutions anywhere in or on the body.
[00:16:16.724 --> 00:16:21.426]  My name is Mario Cifaldi and I'm the developer of the Silver Lungs Generator.

[00:17:11.647 --> 00:17:18.136]  And placing your child's name on the angel tree in hopes of a Christmas gift, along with thousands of other Americans.
[00:17:18.636 --> 00:17:21.877]  Did you ever think your future would feel this out of control?
[00:17:21.877 --> 00:17:27.079]  The fact is, in all this craziness, there's only one thing you can control.
[00:17:27.079 --> 00:17:28.619]  Your greatest dependency.
[00:17:28.619 --> 00:17:30.039]  Your food supply.
[00:17:30.039 --> 00:17:34.221]  Make 2012 the year you take control by getting prepared.
[00:17:34.221 --> 00:17:38.502]  eFoods Direct introduces the best way to build your food supply in the 21st century.
[00:17:38.982 --> 00:17:39.542]  We're good.
[00:18:00.632 --> 00:18:07.275]  When you're out on the road, the last place you want to be is on the road.
[00:18:07.275 --> 00:18:12.418]  But if the unfortunate happens, you'll be glad you were wearing diamond gussets.
[00:18:12.418 --> 00:18:21.142]  There's a place down in Tennessee, where they make blue diamond gusset jeans.
[00:18:21.142 --> 00:18:25.204]  They sew pride in every stitch.
[00:18:25.204 --> 00:18:27.566]  Guarantee you'll love the way they fit.
[00:18:29.640 --> 00:18:34.222]  They put a Diamond Gusset in the crotch, where you need it most.
[00:18:34.222 --> 00:18:39.305]  Blue Diamond Gussets got it, others don't.
[00:18:39.305 --> 00:18:41.446]  We turn jeans inside out.
[00:18:41.446 --> 00:18:43.226]  Diamond Gusset Jeans.
[00:18:43.226 --> 00:18:46.108]  Made in the USA with unparalleled quality.
[00:18:46.108 --> 00:18:52.751]  Our Defender Motorcycle Jeans combine Gusset comfort with Kevlar protection, so you can ride all day with confidence.

[00:18:55.452 --> 00:18:58.674]  Diamond Gusset Jeans got it, others don't.
[00:19:04.151 --> 00:19:05.412]  Tyranny is here.
[00:19:05.412 --> 00:19:09.355]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[00:19:09.355 --> 00:19:11.576]  It really says that the state is God.
[00:19:11.576 --> 00:19:17.440]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on earth.
[00:19:17.440 --> 00:19:23.685]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps now being expanded nationwide.
[00:19:24.105 --> 00:19:30.087]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful shadow state.
[00:19:30.087 --> 00:19:34.268]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depth to which our republic has fallen.
[00:19:34.268 --> 00:19:38.549]  Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship.
[00:19:38.549 --> 00:19:44.511]  Body scanners, sound cannons, citizen spies, stage terror and cameras on every street corner.
[00:19:44.511 --> 00:19:48.052]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[00:19:48.052 --> 00:19:50.033]  The police state isn't coming.
[00:19:50.033 --> 00:19:50.453]  It's here.

[00:20:01.196 --> 00:20:04.778]  Coast to Coast, direct from Austin.
[00:20:04.778 --> 00:20:10.360]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network.
[00:20:10.360 --> 00:20:17.362]  What we've got here is failure to communicate.
[00:20:17.362 --> 00:20:20.443]  Some men you just can't reach.
[00:20:21.311 --> 00:20:26.633]  So you get what we had here last week, which is the way he wants it.
[00:20:26.633 --> 00:20:27.833]  Well, he is.
[00:20:27.833 --> 00:20:36.856]  I don't like it any more than you do.
[00:20:36.856 --> 00:20:39.496]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:20:39.496 --> 00:20:40.897]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:20:44.461 --> 00:20:46.763]  In the final equation, it's really simple.
[00:20:46.763 --> 00:20:57.750]  The New World Order is a group of finance oligarchs that control the issuance of currency and credit through fractional reserve money-changing fraud.
[00:20:57.750 --> 00:20:59.351]  The derivatives are an example of that.
[00:20:59.351 --> 00:21:07.056]  Just absolutely worthless, but they have governments sign you on to pay taxes to back up the derivatives, so now they have value.
[00:21:08.044 --> 00:21:28.605]  Instead of going to jail, the big mega banks, all six of them that created this fraud, take over the world and abolish national sovereignty and sell everyone on the fact that your taxes have to go up and your liberties have to go away in the new age of austerity so that they, the technocratic bankers who engineered all this, can run your life.
[00:21:29.366 --> 00:21:36.050]  And because the general public has been raised in front of a television set, believing who wins the football game is all that matters.
[00:21:36.050 --> 00:21:40.172]  It's not even a language that people speak, and so they're like dodo birds.
[00:21:40.172 --> 00:21:51.258]  I like to use this analogy of sailors arriving on the island, and the dodo birds have never had natural predators, so they just sat there and let the sailors club them in the head and eat them.
[00:21:52.452 --> 00:21:56.734]  That's kind of like people in America or folks that are under Western mind control.
[00:21:56.734 --> 00:22:00.556]  We just have no idea what tyranny looks like because we never lived under it.
[00:22:00.556 --> 00:22:11.982]  And I'm going to go to your calls, but I was at a barbecue joint last night that I like, Pokey Joe's in South Austin with my wife and children.
[00:22:12.918 --> 00:22:16.940]  And they had the little back room closed off for a group of people.
[00:22:16.940 --> 00:22:17.960]  There was a curtain right there.
[00:22:17.960 --> 00:22:20.681]  I could see what was going on because it was only partially closed.
[00:22:20.681 --> 00:22:26.683]  Howling and screaming for an hour over a football game, NFL football game.
[00:22:26.683 --> 00:22:29.024]  And of course, I don't pay attention.
[00:22:29.024 --> 00:22:33.546]  I'm not cool, but I could see the crack in the in the
[00:22:34.761 --> 00:22:34.821]  And
[00:22:54.490 --> 00:23:14.040]  These men were coming in and out their children and wives were and the wives all had incredibly serious looks on their faces and and they were praying and and You know for field goals to make it and You would think that their family was in a gladiatorial fight for their lives with battle axes or something
[00:23:15.233 --> 00:23:22.134]  And I'll guarantee you, if I walked up to those folks and said, hey, did you know that most major vaccines have cancer viruses added to them?
[00:23:22.134 --> 00:23:22.915]  Here's some documents.
[00:23:22.915 --> 00:23:24.955]  Or, would you like to know that all over the U.S.
[00:23:24.955 --> 00:23:29.496]  in the last eight months, radiation levels have gone off the charts?
[00:23:29.496 --> 00:23:34.297]  And here's a new report about it today, but the government's not saying take precautions.
[00:23:34.297 --> 00:23:36.978]  They look at me like I had a hundred heads.
[00:23:36.978 --> 00:23:42.539]  Or if I said, hey, did you know the government has just passed a law to allow the secret arrest
[00:23:43.607 --> 00:23:44.027]  Of U.S.
[00:23:44.027 --> 00:23:45.709]  citizens, or even the killing of U.S.
[00:23:45.709 --> 00:23:48.591]  citizens, and no one even knows you're arrested or killed.
[00:23:48.591 --> 00:23:49.992]  The essence of tyranny.
[00:23:49.992 --> 00:23:53.895]  The total overthrow of our Declaration of Independence and Constitution.
[00:23:53.895 --> 00:23:58.318]  Guaranteed they would have looked at me like I was a man from Mars.
[00:23:58.318 --> 00:24:02.681]  But if I'd have walked in there, because they were cheering for the 49ers, and said, how about them 49ers?
[00:24:02.681 --> 00:24:08.846]  That would have been an embrace of family, of tribalism, of love.
[00:24:09.990 --> 00:24:11.891]  All completely shallow.
[00:24:11.891 --> 00:24:13.831]  All completely fake.
[00:24:13.831 --> 00:24:16.272]  All completely just a veneer.
[00:24:16.272 --> 00:24:17.033]  Cheap.
[00:24:17.033 --> 00:24:17.793]  Means nothing.
[00:24:17.793 --> 00:24:21.194]  Globalist propaganda pumped in.
[00:24:21.194 --> 00:24:22.615]  Fake tribalism.
[00:24:22.615 --> 00:24:26.656]  People don't have a Bill of Rights, a Constitution, a free market, a family.
[00:24:26.656 --> 00:24:28.637]  None of that is what you'll fight for.
[00:24:28.637 --> 00:24:39.461]  No, because all day you can wear your favorite team's jersey and strut around and bug your eyes out and primitively jump up and down like a gorilla for your team.
[00:24:41.755 --> 00:24:48.862]  It's pure mind control, and these people are not even living in the real world.
[00:24:48.862 --> 00:25:02.536]  Coming up later, I'm going to get into the draconian legislation, the internet censorship, what we face, and the reason we have hardship, and the reason that our prosperity is leaving the building.
[00:25:03.470 --> 00:25:06.872]  Elvis has left the building, freedom and prosperity are leaving the building.
[00:25:06.872 --> 00:25:10.234]  Because see, when freedom leaves, you never have prosperity.
[00:25:10.234 --> 00:25:18.499]  Freedom, economic, social, religious, all of it.
[00:25:18.499 --> 00:25:23.002]  It's the bellwether, it's the hallmark, it's the indicator, and it's leaving the building.
[00:25:24.858 --> 00:25:26.179]  Kind of like at the dog pound.
[00:25:26.179 --> 00:25:27.520]  Dogs that people don't want.
[00:25:27.520 --> 00:25:34.624]  At the dog pound, they don't strap them down and give them shots to kill them like your little puppy whenever you come into the vet.
[00:25:34.624 --> 00:25:37.086]  That's too expensive to give them a $5 shot.
[00:25:37.086 --> 00:25:46.152]  They just fill a big chamber, cram them full of animals, and then flip a lever and the oxygen is sucked out and they suffocate them.
[00:25:46.152 --> 00:25:49.774]  It's essentially free.
[00:25:49.774 --> 00:25:51.215]  It's a pressure chamber.
[00:25:51.215 --> 00:25:52.536]  They just suck the oxygen out.
[00:25:54.548 --> 00:26:03.397]  But you know, when you go to kill your dog, because it's in pain or whatever, I understand, when you go to euthanize it, you want to hold it and everything and they give it the shot and everything and there's that moment.
[00:26:03.397 --> 00:26:13.447]  They don't throw Sparky in the chamber where you can see it screaming and yelping and begging.
[00:26:13.447 --> 00:26:15.450]  Some of them use carbon monoxide too.
[00:26:17.037 --> 00:26:20.640]  I mean, you don't want to see it begging and gnashing and all of that.
[00:26:20.640 --> 00:26:28.265]  No, no, it's the America is kind of being given a lethal injection too.
[00:26:28.265 --> 00:26:31.828]  And then there's a whole ceremony to it.
[00:26:31.828 --> 00:26:33.689]  But my point, the analogy of
[00:26:36.772 --> 00:26:45.736]  The euthanasia is that our country is just slowly having its liberties, its freedoms sucked out like oxygen.
[00:26:45.736 --> 00:26:48.117]  And so we're now blue in the face.
[00:26:48.117 --> 00:26:58.381]  And you'll find in Rome and Nazi Germany and so many other corrupt, declining systems run by thugs, that as things get worse, people will cling to sports even more.
[00:26:59.341 --> 00:27:04.864]  They won't riot over losing their liberties or the cops shooting an unarmed kid in the back.
[00:27:04.864 --> 00:27:09.706]  No, they'll riot when their team loses or wins.
[00:27:09.706 --> 00:27:14.629]  Because see, men don't go out and engage in combat against some tribe trying to enslave them.
[00:27:14.629 --> 00:27:22.712]  No, they go into a parking lot and beat some baseball fans' brains out.
[00:27:22.712 --> 00:27:25.454]  See, that's our value now.
[00:27:26.542 --> 00:27:40.627]  And it's scientific and Edward Bernays 80 years ago wrote books about how they would sell sports not just to children but adults and let men spend their tribal and manly energies on a facsimile.
[00:27:43.892 --> 00:27:53.899]  I've used the analogy of it's the difference between actually having a wife and a woman you love and that actually you procreate with and create new beings with.
[00:27:53.899 --> 00:27:57.381]  And the system says, no, no, no, no, you don't need an actual wife.
[00:27:57.381 --> 00:27:59.682]  Here's a blow up doll.
[00:27:59.682 --> 00:28:01.284]  That's what sports is for men.
[00:28:01.284 --> 00:28:02.865]  Here, here's a blow up doll.
[00:28:02.865 --> 00:28:04.726]  Do you want one with black hair or blonde hair?
[00:28:08.390 --> 00:28:09.510]  And that's it.
[00:28:09.510 --> 00:28:19.813]  And then I go to these men and I say, you know, I have a book here, a scientific, to manipulate you and make you only be concerned about petty things and paint yourself up in fake trouble colors.
[00:28:19.813 --> 00:28:22.534]  You know, why are you hyperventilating over your team right now?
[00:28:22.534 --> 00:28:26.975]  I mean, even if you have a big bet on it, why is this all this valuable to you?
[00:28:28.682 --> 00:28:38.166]  Manhood is teaching your children about liberties and freedoms and history and how to plant a garden, how to clean a gun, how to fix an engine.
[00:28:38.166 --> 00:28:39.807]  Why do you just all day strut around and...
[00:28:42.025 --> 00:28:47.187]  They'll look at you and say, listen, I don't want the real Marilyn Monroe to be.
[00:28:47.187 --> 00:28:48.147]  I don't want to be a real man.
[00:28:48.147 --> 00:28:50.708]  I don't want to live in a real republic with real responsibilities.
[00:28:50.708 --> 00:28:53.208]  Give me the blow up doll.
[00:28:53.208 --> 00:28:58.790]  And so listen, this is this radio show is not for men that want blow up dolls or women for that matter.
[00:29:01.502 --> 00:29:03.203]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones.
[00:29:03.203 --> 00:29:08.505]  I'm looking for people that have the wisdom to spot savings, opportunity, and recognize risk.
[00:29:08.505 --> 00:29:10.045]  Saving means to make money.
[00:29:10.045 --> 00:29:18.829]  The Cal Bend Pure Soap Company can save you thousands of dollars and give you good old-fashioned real soaps that are triple concentrated and twice as good as what you're using now.
[00:29:19.569 --> 00:29:27.093]  Soaps made from vegetable and coconut oils that contain no useless dyes, perfumes, deodorants, or antibacterials.
[00:29:27.093 --> 00:29:35.097]  Your risk is the hundreds of hazardous toxic detergents that give you rashes, itching sores, and deteriorating clothing called lint.
[00:29:35.097 --> 00:29:42.501]  If you want something better, if you want something you've never had before, you had to do something you've never done before, getting a free catalog is easy by calling 800-340-7091.
[00:29:45.262 --> 00:29:48.485]  Or see Calvin on the web at FiveStarSoap.com.
[00:29:48.485 --> 00:29:50.807]  Take charge of your health now by calling 800-340-7091.
[00:29:50.807 --> 00:29:52.989]  Or see Calvin on the web at FiveStarSoap.com.
[00:30:00.188 --> 00:30:04.333]  Did you ever think you'd be where you are, a decade into the 21st century?
[00:30:04.333 --> 00:30:06.615]  Record foreclosure rates for homes.
[00:30:06.615 --> 00:30:08.477]  If not yours, your neighbor's.
[00:30:08.477 --> 00:30:11.440]  Thankful for the unemployment check since you were laid off.
[00:30:11.440 --> 00:30:17.948]  And placing your child's name on the angel tree in hopes of a Christmas gift, along with thousands of other Americans.
[00:30:18.428 --> 00:30:21.650]  Did you ever think your future would feel this out of control?
[00:30:21.650 --> 00:30:26.874]  The fact is, in all this craziness, there's only one thing you can control.
[00:30:26.874 --> 00:30:28.415]  Your greatest dependency.
[00:30:28.415 --> 00:30:29.836]  Your food supply.
[00:30:29.836 --> 00:30:34.019]  Make 2012 the year you take control by getting prepared.
[00:30:34.019 --> 00:30:38.322]  eFoods Direct introduces the best way to build your food supply in the 21st century.
[00:30:39.242 --> 00:30:39.462]  We're good.
[00:30:59.790 --> 00:31:04.353]  This is Alex Jones with 5 good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[00:31:04.353 --> 00:31:05.253]  Number 1.
[00:31:05.253 --> 00:31:08.696]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[00:31:08.696 --> 00:31:09.536]  Number 2.
[00:31:09.536 --> 00:31:14.439]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[00:31:14.439 --> 00:31:15.180]  It's true.
[00:31:15.180 --> 00:31:20.063]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[00:31:20.063 --> 00:31:20.883]  Number 3.
[00:31:20.883 --> 00:31:24.466]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[00:31:24.466 --> 00:31:28.168]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[00:31:28.368 --> 00:31:29.169]  Number 4.
[00:31:29.169 --> 00:31:31.931]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[00:31:31.931 --> 00:31:35.614]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[00:31:35.614 --> 00:31:36.395]  Number 5.
[00:31:36.395 --> 00:31:40.539]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[00:31:40.539 --> 00:31:45.303]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[00:31:45.583 --> 00:31:49.765]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[00:31:49.765 --> 00:31:51.546]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[00:31:51.546 --> 00:31:53.808]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun.
[00:31:53.808 --> 00:31:56.149]  So go to mysolarbackup.com or call 1-877-327-0365.
[00:32:01.530 --> 00:32:05.511]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about the Silver Lungs Generator.
[00:32:05.511 --> 00:32:14.373]  Now you can produce pure and endless colloidal silver and deliver the solution directly into the bloodstream by breathing the solution through the lungs.
[00:32:14.373 --> 00:32:18.994]  The respiratory system is the first line of defense for airborne pathogens and viruses.
[00:32:18.994 --> 00:32:29.816]  The Silver Lungs Generator infuses the respiratory system with your self-produced nano-silver solutions and also delivers the silver nanoparticles instantly into the bloodstream.
[00:32:30.436 --> 00:32:39.965]  With continued legislation threatening the sale of nano-silver products, you can now produce pure and endless colloidal silver with the Silver Lungs Generator.
[00:32:39.965 --> 00:32:45.390]  Very easy to follow step-by-step instructions are provided, making production fast and simple.
[00:32:45.390 --> 00:32:52.876]  Go to www.silverlungs.com today and learn more about the breakthrough technology of the Silver Lungs Generator.
[00:32:52.876 --> 00:32:55.298]  That's www.silverlungs.com.
[00:33:01.351 --> 00:33:04.942]  Coast to Coast, direct from Austin.
[00:33:04.942 --> 00:33:08.152]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network.
[00:33:20.211 --> 00:33:22.753]  Monday through Friday from 11 a.m.
[00:33:22.753 --> 00:33:23.414]  to 2 p.m.
[00:33:23.414 --> 00:33:24.014]  Central Time.
[00:33:24.014 --> 00:33:25.095]  That's 12 noon to 3 p.m.
[00:33:25.095 --> 00:33:26.176]  Eastern.
[00:33:26.176 --> 00:33:28.117]  I'm here on the radio, and that's not enough.
[00:33:28.117 --> 00:33:31.200]  I come back for two hours every Sunday, 4 to 6 p.m.
[00:33:31.200 --> 00:33:32.861]  Central as well.
[00:33:32.861 --> 00:33:37.264]  That's 2 to 4 Pacific, 3 to 5 Mountain.
[00:33:37.264 --> 00:33:41.567]  Okay, I said I'd go to your calls in this hour, and I'm going to them right now.
[00:33:41.567 --> 00:33:47.112]  And then coming up, controversial online privacy bill shelved until census is found.
[00:33:48.522 --> 00:33:49.824]  A consensus is found.
[00:33:49.824 --> 00:33:56.272]  This is a playing possum operation trying to pass the SOPA bill and the IP bill to censor the internet.
[00:33:56.272 --> 00:33:57.674]  I know their tricks.
[00:33:57.674 --> 00:33:59.216]  Gonna be breaking that down.
[00:33:59.216 --> 00:34:04.163]  Also, we'll get into S&P cuts ratings in nine eurozone nations.
[00:34:04.163 --> 00:34:05.525]  They cut it down to US level.
[00:34:07.506 --> 00:34:11.308]  Fed to way further easing amid doubt about recovery.
[00:34:11.308 --> 00:34:13.249]  That's going to be the QE3.
[00:34:13.249 --> 00:34:14.830]  We thought that would happen by December.
[00:34:14.830 --> 00:34:16.431]  And I talked to my sources.
[00:34:16.431 --> 00:34:18.291]  They said, well, now it's going to happen by February.
[00:34:18.291 --> 00:34:20.112]  And here's CNBC.
[00:34:20.112 --> 00:34:23.134]  That means hyperinflation.
[00:34:23.134 --> 00:34:25.555]  We've got a bunch of news on the Cashless Society.
[00:34:25.555 --> 00:34:29.017]  And that means they can take fines and fees out without even asking you.
[00:34:29.017 --> 00:34:32.559]  Kind of like Bank of America wanting five bucks every time you use your bank card.
[00:34:33.639 --> 00:34:35.561]  That's all coming up.
[00:34:35.561 --> 00:34:38.964]  Also some dirty tricks against Ron Paul, but I'm going to cover that next hour.
[00:34:38.964 --> 00:34:41.866]  That's when all the big news, and we'll continue with your calls then.
[00:34:41.866 --> 00:34:43.527]  Right now, let's hurry through your calls.
[00:34:43.527 --> 00:34:44.668]  Have your question and comment ready.
[00:34:44.668 --> 00:34:50.413]  Let's move the next person, because I've got about 100 people here online.
[00:34:50.413 --> 00:34:54.016]  From Aaron to Jenna, and everybody in between.
[00:34:54.016 --> 00:34:58.099]  Aaron in Illinois, you're on the air, welcome.
[00:34:58.099 --> 00:34:59.240]  Thank you Alex, how are you?
[00:34:59.240 --> 00:35:01.162]  Good sir, thank you for calling on a Sunday.
[00:35:01.800 --> 00:35:03.101]  Hey, this is great.
[00:35:03.101 --> 00:35:04.481]  I'm glad to finally be on your show.
[00:35:04.481 --> 00:35:07.783]  I've been a Prism Planet member for about two years now.
[00:35:07.783 --> 00:35:11.064]  You woke me up about two years ago when I was driving through Texas.
[00:35:11.064 --> 00:35:12.905]  And I just, I love you, man.
[00:35:12.905 --> 00:35:15.146]  You're doing a great job.
[00:35:15.146 --> 00:35:22.029]  I want to thank you and all your crew and just say that, you know, everybody needs to get behind Ron Paul.
[00:35:22.029 --> 00:35:30.693]  I agree with, you know, the new, the latest article there on InfoWars about, from Paul Craig Roberts.
[00:35:31.371 --> 00:35:33.392]  You know, this is our last chance.
[00:35:33.392 --> 00:35:36.133]  Everybody needs to get behind him.
[00:35:36.133 --> 00:35:36.973]  I support him.
[00:35:36.973 --> 00:35:42.054]  By the way, I intend to read that article coming up in the next hour.
[00:35:42.054 --> 00:35:44.475]  That's the first article I'm going to cover.
[00:35:44.475 --> 00:35:45.635]  America's Last Chance.
[00:35:45.635 --> 00:35:52.538]  Paul Craig Roberts, former head of the Department of the Treasury, father of Reaganomics, former Wall Street Journal editor, breaking that down.
[00:35:52.538 --> 00:35:56.379]  And then I also have this other article that you mentioned, Ron Paul, coming up.
[00:35:57.159 --> 00:36:09.051]  Remember with Rand, how they had the Democratic challenger, a guy he was running against, his employees would dress up as hayseeds and then go out and say racist stuff and hold up racist signs?
[00:36:09.051 --> 00:36:18.079]  Well, they've caught him again with Ron Paul dressing people up as Ku Klux Klan members, and it turns out that's Republican Party doing that.
[00:36:18.079 --> 00:36:20.462]  So, there's going to be some dirty tricks, my friend.
[00:36:22.267 --> 00:36:23.628]  Well, that's a shame.
[00:36:23.628 --> 00:36:25.190]  So, I just wanted to thank you.
[00:36:25.190 --> 00:36:29.914]  Well, they're not going to turn loose of power easily, brother, Aaron.
[00:36:29.914 --> 00:36:31.435]  But, I mean, listen, you got the floor.
[00:36:31.435 --> 00:36:32.876]  You said you've been waiting years to get on.
[00:36:32.876 --> 00:36:34.858]  Go ahead.
[00:36:34.858 --> 00:36:39.302]  Well, like I said, I just, you know, you talked about Dodo Birds there before.
[00:36:39.302 --> 00:36:40.863]  I used to be one of those Dodo Birds.
[00:36:40.863 --> 00:36:42.885]  I used to be back there.
[00:36:42.885 --> 00:36:46.028]  Right now, I'd be watching, you know, NFL football, you know.
[00:36:46.823 --> 00:36:49.864]  Two or three years ago, but now it's not like that anymore.
[00:36:49.864 --> 00:36:56.866]  I've woken up, and you've said it many times, reality is a lot more exciting than what you see on TV.
[00:36:56.866 --> 00:36:57.787]  It certainly is.
[00:36:57.787 --> 00:36:59.287]  God bless you.
[00:36:59.287 --> 00:37:00.548]  God bless you, Aaron.
[00:37:00.548 --> 00:37:03.489]  And again, folks, I played football in high school.
[00:37:03.489 --> 00:37:04.489]  I ran track.
[00:37:04.489 --> 00:37:05.369]  I swam.
[00:37:05.369 --> 00:37:08.870]  Won blue ribbons almost every time in Dallas.
[00:37:08.870 --> 00:37:09.691]  Okay?
[00:37:09.691 --> 00:37:10.711]  Yeah, Mr. Blue Ribbon.
[00:37:10.711 --> 00:37:11.491]  Mr. Blue Ribbon.
[00:37:11.491 --> 00:37:13.272]  Got 50 of them, or more.
[00:37:14.699 --> 00:37:18.840]  Sports themselves are great.
[00:37:18.840 --> 00:37:23.381]  That's wonderful, wholesome, healthy, if you're in the game.
[00:37:23.381 --> 00:37:26.102]  Or if your family member is on the field.
[00:37:26.102 --> 00:37:27.323]  That's completely different.
[00:37:27.323 --> 00:37:31.804]  I have nothing against high school football, any of that.
[00:37:31.804 --> 00:37:35.645]  But when I watch grown adults
[00:37:36.650 --> 00:37:50.062]  They only care in a sycophantic way about NFL, about NBA, about PGA, about all of this, and it's everything to them, and then you notice as a byproduct they don't care about any serious issues.
[00:37:50.062 --> 00:37:54.507]  I mean, it's life and death to them.
[00:37:54.507 --> 00:37:58.330]  They're living vicariously through it, and I want to see you live.
[00:37:58.330 --> 00:38:01.193]  I want to see you be a champion at business, a champion parent.
[00:38:02.455 --> 00:38:04.156]  I want to be that as well.
[00:38:04.156 --> 00:38:05.917]  I mean, it's hard to raise good children.
[00:38:05.917 --> 00:38:08.378]  It's hard to make it in this economy.
[00:38:08.378 --> 00:38:15.622]  And I'm telling you, it is a societal bellwether.
[00:38:15.622 --> 00:38:19.724]  It is known that as society declines, people get more obsessed with sports.
[00:38:19.724 --> 00:38:20.645]  And the system knows that.
[00:38:20.645 --> 00:38:22.946]  It's called bread and circus.
[00:38:22.946 --> 00:38:27.228]  They gave the Romans free bread, welfare, and free games.
[00:38:27.228 --> 00:38:29.310]  Bread and circus, folks.
[00:38:29.310 --> 00:38:30.790]  All right, I'm going to shut up here.
[00:38:30.790 --> 00:38:31.411]  Good points, Aaron.
[00:38:32.265 --> 00:38:35.347]  Adam in Canada, you're on the air, go ahead.
[00:38:35.347 --> 00:38:38.889]  Yeah, hey, I just wanted to say some stuff about vaccines.
[00:38:38.889 --> 00:38:51.477]  First off, the word inoculate comes from Latin inoculare, which refers to the practice of grafting plant species together to make a third hybrid species.
[00:38:51.477 --> 00:38:55.840]  Given that a lot of vaccines are incubated in monkey kidneys, I wonder what's really going on there.
[00:38:57.028 --> 00:38:58.590]  Well, here's the deal.
[00:38:58.590 --> 00:39:00.992]  Vaccines are at least 500 years old.
[00:39:00.992 --> 00:39:02.394]  There is some truth to it.
[00:39:02.394 --> 00:39:09.242]  The problem is the companies are given liability protection and have a history of absolute carnage.
[00:39:09.242 --> 00:39:16.610]  From HIV in the products, on record, Bayer Pharmaceutical with a factor VIII blood drug slash vaccine, to
[00:39:18.692 --> 00:39:25.118]  I mean every day or two I see articles about this company fine for 15 babies dying and vaccine experiments.
[00:39:25.118 --> 00:39:27.961]  You cannot trust these companies.
[00:39:27.961 --> 00:39:29.523]  That's my issue on the vaccines.
[00:39:31.374 --> 00:39:39.101]  Well, I think that when you look at what a virus really is, it's identified by its molecular size and weight, not its behavior.
[00:39:39.101 --> 00:39:43.925]  You might as well add metal shavings to your car engine to protect it from metal shavings.
[00:39:43.925 --> 00:39:44.706]  Well, I agree with you.
[00:39:44.706 --> 00:39:50.491]  You know, if you really study viral technology, what they call these fourth-generation vaccines aren't even vaccines.
[00:39:50.491 --> 00:39:51.472]  They are nanotech.
[00:39:51.932 --> 00:40:04.303]  They are fully manufactured viruses that are nothing more than a self-replicating data program that reads and runs in a cell.
[00:40:04.303 --> 00:40:07.406]  And they're 100% manufactured.
[00:40:07.406 --> 00:40:10.629]  And they've got all sorts of piggyback stuff built into them.
[00:40:11.169 --> 00:40:17.995]  And then you find out the big vaccine companies were all set up by robber baron eugenicist a hundred years ago, and it's all about population reduction.
[00:40:17.995 --> 00:40:26.422]  They've had vaccines out for a decade that they haven't gotten approval of, but we've documented they're piggybacking them into other vaccines that actually change brain chemistry.
[00:40:26.422 --> 00:40:29.745]  You know, to where you can't be aggressive or you can't be depressed.
[00:40:29.745 --> 00:40:32.387]  You've heard of the vaccines that, quote, cure drug addiction.
[00:40:32.387 --> 00:40:35.810]  Yeah, by attacking endorphin receptor sites.
[00:40:35.810 --> 00:40:38.453]  You know, I ran 10 miles today.
[00:40:39.249 --> 00:40:42.371]  I'm up to 10 miles now.
[00:40:42.371 --> 00:40:46.815]  I mean, I've lost 34 pounds in six weeks doing that.
[00:40:46.815 --> 00:40:47.595]  And you know what?
[00:40:47.595 --> 00:40:58.564]  I had a huge endorphin rush when I crossed over the eight mile mark and went over and leaned over the side of the road and threw up and went ahead and ran the extra two miles.
[00:40:59.364 --> 00:41:04.466]  Okay, I don't need a vaccine that will go and attack my receptors.
[00:41:04.466 --> 00:41:08.348]  I want my natural dope, and I'm going to get it.
[00:41:08.348 --> 00:41:11.470]  I don't need the government's cocaine and heroin being shipped in.
[00:41:11.470 --> 00:41:12.730]  But those aren't even vaccines.
[00:41:12.730 --> 00:41:19.613]  Those are fantastic, you know, journey, you know, little microbes that go in and hit the targets.
[00:41:19.613 --> 00:41:20.394]  I appreciate your call.
[00:41:20.394 --> 00:41:20.874]  Great points.
[00:41:21.714 --> 00:41:25.435]  Uh, Kevin, Sean, Mario, Tommy, Zach, James, Robert, Susan, Jenna.
[00:41:25.435 --> 00:41:26.276]  We'll get to all of you.
[00:41:26.276 --> 00:41:28.036]  Let's get to the end and go to some ladies.
[00:41:28.036 --> 00:41:29.977]  Let's go to Jenna in California.
[00:41:29.977 --> 00:41:30.977]  Jenna, you're on the air.
[00:41:30.977 --> 00:41:35.939]  Hey, Jenna.
[00:41:35.939 --> 00:41:37.700]  Come on down.
[00:41:37.700 --> 00:41:38.660]  Alex?
[00:41:38.660 --> 00:41:39.040]  Welcome.
[00:41:39.040 --> 00:41:40.041]  Can you hear me?
[00:41:40.041 --> 00:41:40.301]  I can.
[00:41:40.301 --> 00:41:41.301]  Just turn your radio down.
[00:41:41.301 --> 00:41:43.642]  Okay, let me turn it down.
[00:41:43.642 --> 00:41:44.802]  My name is Gina.
[00:41:44.802 --> 00:41:45.223]  Gina.
[00:41:45.223 --> 00:41:46.023]  Okay, go ahead, Gina.
[00:41:46.932 --> 00:41:47.532]  Hi Alex!
[00:41:47.532 --> 00:41:48.652]  Oh my God!
[00:41:48.652 --> 00:41:49.913]  So you know what?
[00:41:49.913 --> 00:41:51.933]  I appreciate your humbleness.
[00:41:51.933 --> 00:41:55.174]  I understand that a lot of us praise you and we say we love you and we do.
[00:41:55.174 --> 00:41:56.394]  I do.
[00:41:56.394 --> 00:42:01.335]  We love you out here but we praise you because we're so thirsty for something real.
[00:42:01.335 --> 00:42:03.875]  You know, I've never really been a dodo bird.
[00:42:03.875 --> 00:42:15.718]  I can say I've been like maybe ignorant to something because I did not know but I was just woken up maybe a year ago by an older gentleman friend of mine and
[00:42:17.068 --> 00:42:18.889]  He just said, you know, let me show you something.
[00:42:18.889 --> 00:42:20.250]  He says, can you get to YouTube?
[00:42:20.250 --> 00:42:21.590]  And I said, yeah.
[00:42:21.590 --> 00:42:25.432]  So I sat down and I, uh, I got this iPhone and I put the connection.
[00:42:25.432 --> 00:42:28.633]  I can plug it into my TV and see everything on TV.
[00:42:28.633 --> 00:42:32.976]  And so he told me to go to YouTube and look up loose change.
[00:42:32.976 --> 00:42:36.097]  And ever since I looked that up, I had another niece.
[00:42:36.097 --> 00:42:36.557]  She's about 25.
[00:42:36.557 --> 00:42:39.939]  Me and her, not only did we wake up,
[00:42:42.067 --> 00:42:43.608]  Tell you what, I want to hear more.
[00:42:43.608 --> 00:42:44.708]  Don't hang up.
[00:42:44.708 --> 00:42:47.489]  Gina, did I get that right the third time?
[00:42:47.489 --> 00:42:52.491]  And then we'll go to Susan, Robert, James, Zach, Tommy, Mario, and others straight ahead.
[00:42:52.491 --> 00:42:58.673]  I want to hear more about your awakening because there's folks out there listening right now who are awakening for the first time themselves.
[00:43:01.747 --> 00:43:05.771]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[00:43:05.771 --> 00:43:09.015]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[00:43:09.015 --> 00:43:14.181]  As they're finishing off this agenda, they'll be pulling the rug from underneath the Americans at home.
[00:43:14.181 --> 00:43:20.207]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[00:43:20.207 --> 00:43:22.450]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us
[00:43:22.990 --> 00:43:23.290]  Tim Geithner?
[00:43:23.290 --> 00:43:23.530]  Bernanke?
[00:43:23.530 --> 00:43:23.971]  They're arsonists!
[00:43:23.971 --> 00:43:24.731]  They're asking for more matches!
[00:43:24.731 --> 00:43:26.132]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[00:43:41.880 --> 00:43:49.169]  Today seems like nobody does care and right now in Washington DC we have seen a fall of the Republic.

[00:44:00.441 --> 00:44:01.743]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[00:44:01.743 --> 00:44:07.330]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[00:44:07.330 --> 00:44:12.357]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds could become more valuable than silver or gold?
[00:44:12.357 --> 00:44:17.403]  It's true, seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country, and it's possible they could even happen again.
[00:44:17.924 --> 00:44:23.148]  So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds.
[00:44:23.148 --> 00:44:25.449]  They call it a Survival Seed Bank.
[00:44:25.449 --> 00:44:30.252]  And it can produce an endless supply of nutrient-dense food for you and your family.
[00:44:30.252 --> 00:44:31.373]  And here's the best part.
[00:44:31.373 --> 00:44:34.455]  These seeds have not been genetically modified in any way.
[00:44:34.455 --> 00:44:38.078]  And you actually get enough seeds to plant a full acre crisis garden.
[00:44:38.078 --> 00:44:41.260]  So visit them today at SurvivalSeedBank.com.
[00:44:41.260 --> 00:44:43.481]  That's SurvivalSeedBank.com.
[00:44:43.481 --> 00:44:44.402]  Or give them a call at 877-327-0365.
[00:44:48.044 --> 00:44:49.486]  That's 877-327-0365.
[00:44:49.486 --> 00:44:57.113]  Remember, in a real crisis, non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item.
[00:44:57.113 --> 00:44:59.495]  This is Alex Jones for survivalseedbank.com.
[00:45:00.225 --> 00:45:04.350]  Did you ever think you'd be where you are, a decade into the 21st century?
[00:45:04.350 --> 00:45:06.652]  Record foreclosure rates for homes.
[00:45:06.652 --> 00:45:08.494]  If not yours, your neighbor's.
[00:45:08.494 --> 00:45:11.457]  Thankful for the unemployment check since you were laid off.
[00:45:11.457 --> 00:45:17.965]  And placing your child's name on the angel tree in hopes of a Christmas gift, along with thousands of other Americans.
[00:45:18.445 --> 00:45:21.688]  Did you ever think your future would feel this out of control?
[00:45:21.688 --> 00:45:26.912]  The fact is, in all this craziness, there's only one thing you can control.
[00:45:26.912 --> 00:45:28.433]  Your greatest dependency.
[00:45:28.433 --> 00:45:29.854]  Your food supply.
[00:45:29.854 --> 00:45:34.057]  Make 2012 the year you take control by getting prepared.

[00:46:04.099 --> 00:46:05.360]  Tyranny is here.
[00:46:05.360 --> 00:46:08.902]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[00:46:08.902 --> 00:46:11.524]  It really says that the state is God.
[00:46:11.524 --> 00:46:17.387]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on Earth.
[00:46:17.387 --> 00:46:23.631]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps, now being expanded nationwide.
[00:46:24.051 --> 00:46:30.034]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful shadow state.
[00:46:30.034 --> 00:46:34.216]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depth to which our republic has fallen.
[00:46:34.216 --> 00:46:38.499]  Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship.
[00:46:38.499 --> 00:46:44.442]  Body scanners, sound cannons, citizen spies, stage terror, and cameras on every street corner.
[00:46:44.442 --> 00:46:48.004]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[00:46:48.004 --> 00:46:49.965]  The police state isn't coming.
[00:46:49.965 --> 00:46:50.405]  It's here.

[00:47:13.274 --> 00:47:14.114]  Can you hear me?
[00:47:42.648 --> 00:48:12.400]  Okay, okay, anyway, uh, when we saw Loose Change, uh, we sat there and we watched it from beginning to end, you know, I didn't understand all of the section codes, I didn't understand a lot of the, uh, I didn't even know half of the people, uh, that the narrator was speaking on, but you know, I got this iPhone, I take notes, you know, I got it where it's called, it's jailbroken, so I can slide it down and do and take notes really quick, so I take notes on names I know all about,
[00:48:13.133 --> 00:48:14.295]  The Big New Brzezinski.
[00:48:14.295 --> 00:48:20.102]  Look, I'm an African American woman out here in the inland area of California near the mountains.
[00:48:20.102 --> 00:48:28.131]  And, you know, I'm so woke that... I didn't understand you before when you used to say, I'm getting chills.
[00:48:28.131 --> 00:48:28.852]  But you know what?
[00:48:28.852 --> 00:48:29.433]  I get those.
[00:48:30.074 --> 00:48:30.915]  We're good to go.
[00:48:45.314 --> 00:48:45.895]  We're good to go.
[00:49:00.128 --> 00:49:00.348]  I don't
[00:49:16.650 --> 00:49:34.702]  Excluding Ron Paul from debates, or giving him 89 seconds, or saying he can't win even though he's in second place all over the country, and talking down to people, and all these dirty tricks, or when he does get in second place on a poll, CBS and CNN and Fox all leave him out.
[00:49:34.702 --> 00:49:36.944]  I mean, it shows the system's scared of him.
[00:49:36.944 --> 00:49:45.169]  And even if you don't like Ron Paul's politics, it shows you the system tries to make you think the way they want to think.
[00:49:45.169 --> 00:49:46.030]  And who do they work for?
[00:49:46.971 --> 00:49:51.817]  A bunch of megacorporations bigger than most governments who could care less about our liberties and freedoms.
[00:49:51.817 --> 00:49:56.382]  And who are trying to set up a global corporate government called the New World Order.
[00:49:56.382 --> 00:49:59.707]  And you bet I get chills all the time when I realize this stuff.
[00:49:59.707 --> 00:50:01.068]  It's mind-blowing.
[00:50:01.068 --> 00:50:03.852]  Let's go to Susan in California as well.
[00:50:03.852 --> 00:50:04.513]  Susan, welcome.
[00:50:05.435 --> 00:50:06.236]  Thank you, Alex.
[00:50:06.236 --> 00:50:10.718]  Let me tell you, it is an honor, sir, to actually get on your show.
[00:50:10.718 --> 00:50:13.000]  I just wanted to have a little quick story for you.
[00:50:13.000 --> 00:50:17.503]  I wanted to say thank you for shedding light on the Bohemian Grove.
[00:50:17.503 --> 00:50:22.066]  I've been a listener every day for about a year and a half.
[00:50:22.066 --> 00:50:34.494]  The Bohemian Grove is what set the spark, and I went and found the information and started, it just started building and building, and I can't thank you enough for that, and I share that with a lot of other, you know, friends and stuff.
[00:50:36.095 --> 00:50:58.868]  But my comment is about the dumbing down of America, and right now I have a foreign exchange student in our house, and I'm just amazed because when she came here, she was so excited to share her culture, and in the school that she's at now, the kids, she would tell me, didn't even know where Europe was.
[00:50:58.868 --> 00:51:01.290]  They couldn't even point out Europe, let alone her country.
[00:51:01.290 --> 00:51:02.551]  You know, I meant to cover it.
[00:51:03.311 --> 00:51:07.112]  And I didn't, and the guys will never remember how to find it because I don't remember the headline.
[00:51:07.112 --> 00:51:17.276]  There was an article like last Monday you guys gave me about, I think it was something like 40 facts about American school children, about American students' knowledge.
[00:51:17.276 --> 00:51:19.196]  It'll blow your mind or something like that.
[00:51:19.196 --> 00:51:22.938]  And it was like 70-something percent can't find Europe.
[00:51:22.938 --> 00:51:26.279]  I mean, these numbers were just off the charts.
[00:51:26.279 --> 00:51:27.439]  And that's the thing.
[00:51:27.439 --> 00:51:28.720]  I talked to adults.
[00:51:29.620 --> 00:51:35.063]  And they know how to do one job and go home and watch TV and that's it.
[00:51:35.063 --> 00:51:37.324]  They don't know what continents are.
[00:51:37.324 --> 00:51:39.685]  They don't know what different species are.
[00:51:39.685 --> 00:51:42.807]  They don't even have basic information.
[00:51:42.807 --> 00:51:48.850]  And you can really see what they've done through this mind control and cultural dumbing down to us.
[00:51:48.850 --> 00:51:51.191]  Fifty years ago we had the highest test scores.
[00:51:51.191 --> 00:51:53.052]  The most inventors.
[00:51:53.052 --> 00:51:54.953]  Just on every front.
[00:51:54.953 --> 00:51:57.154]  The New World Order has ruined us.
[00:51:58.174 --> 00:52:04.317]  Absolutely, and she couldn't believe that the kids were more concerned about how she did her nails as opposed to her country.
[00:52:04.317 --> 00:52:08.618]  I mean, it was just like a punch in the gut here as an American citizen.
[00:52:08.618 --> 00:52:09.979]  Well, here's what they've done.
[00:52:09.979 --> 00:52:14.181]  They've gotten us to give up our birthright, all politics stuff, who cares about that?
[00:52:14.181 --> 00:52:16.182]  All history, that's boring.
[00:52:16.182 --> 00:52:20.183]  And no, let's talk about what type of bra you wear, what type of lipstick.
[00:52:20.183 --> 00:52:21.104]  That's what's important.
[00:52:21.104 --> 00:52:23.725]  They've given us petty mindlessness.
[00:52:24.625 --> 00:52:27.412]  And made people artificially very, very shallow.
[00:52:27.412 --> 00:52:27.933]  But remember...
[00:52:29.518 --> 00:52:35.381]  The globalists have done that so the general public isn't involved in the real world, so the criminals can run things.
[00:52:35.381 --> 00:52:38.743]  But the criminals are a tiny minority, Susan.
[00:52:38.743 --> 00:52:42.645]  Those of us that are awake are a minority, but we dwarf them probably a thousand to one.
[00:52:42.645 --> 00:52:47.467]  I mean, Kissinger's top guy at Kissinger Associates wrote Superclass five years ago.
[00:52:47.467 --> 00:52:47.928]  I had him on.
[00:52:47.928 --> 00:52:53.050]  He says there's 6,000 super gophers that run the whole planet, less than 20 families.
[00:52:53.050 --> 00:52:57.913]  Same analysis I had, reverse engineering their system, their oligarchy.
[00:52:58.673 --> 00:53:02.036]  Our plutocracy, depending on how you want to look at it.
[00:53:02.036 --> 00:53:05.099]  But, I mean, there's way more of us than 6,000 of them.
[00:53:05.099 --> 00:53:08.783]  I mean, there's probably 20% of the country is pretty much awake.
[00:53:08.783 --> 00:53:10.505]  Even Gallup reports that.
[00:53:10.505 --> 00:53:12.126]  So, we've got tens of millions.
[00:53:12.126 --> 00:53:13.007]  They've got 6,000.
[00:53:13.007 --> 00:53:22.256]  So, the New World Order, just because they've turned the general public into drooling zombies, doesn't mean they've won the game.
[00:53:22.256 --> 00:53:22.857]  You understand that?
[00:53:23.533 --> 00:53:24.274]  Yes, yes.
[00:53:24.274 --> 00:53:26.515]  No, I totally understand that.
[00:53:26.515 --> 00:53:30.799]  And the other thing, too, that I can't believe is that she's going to Washington, D.C.
[00:53:30.799 --> 00:53:31.159]  soon.
[00:53:31.159 --> 00:53:34.262]  She won a contest out of all the different exchange students.
[00:53:34.262 --> 00:53:41.628]  And I told her, if they ask you who your host family is going to vote for, you tell them Ron Paul all the way.
[00:53:41.628 --> 00:53:50.255]  You know, like I said, I was an Obama zombie, and I just feel so disenfranchised and sick that I'm going to fight even harder for Ron Paul in his campaign.
[00:53:50.916 --> 00:53:53.047]  Well that's the way to go and don't feel bad.
[00:53:53.047 --> 00:53:54.353]  Bush was so horrible.
[00:53:55.504 --> 00:54:11.335]  And so wicked, and so gross, that we hoped Obama, we didn't support him of course, but early on, oh Obama says he'll do this and that, and then, before he even got elected, I said look at his advisors, same people that Mitt Romney's got.
[00:54:11.335 --> 00:54:21.381]  I mean, Mitt Romney is a carbon copy of Obama, he has an R before his name instead of a D. That is the only difference, and it's so sad.
[00:54:21.381 --> 00:54:23.343]  And so I don't want to hear any conservatives
[00:54:24.795 --> 00:54:29.016]  Or libertarians or constitutionalists make fun of Obama supporters.
[00:54:29.016 --> 00:54:30.156]  Mitt Romney.
[00:54:30.156 --> 00:54:36.358]  I'm talking about his votes as a governor and what his company Bain Capital lobbied for.
[00:54:36.358 --> 00:54:40.959]  Abortion, open borders, carbon taxes, road Obamacare.
[00:54:40.959 --> 00:54:44.760]  Do I need to keep going here?
[00:54:44.760 --> 00:54:45.761]  Bring her back up, I can hear her.
[00:54:45.761 --> 00:54:46.321]  Go ahead, ma'am.
[00:54:47.068 --> 00:54:50.230]  I get really scared about, like I said, this election.
[00:54:50.230 --> 00:54:52.812]  And this one really makes me nervous because of the state we're in.
[00:54:52.812 --> 00:54:54.673]  We can't, our back is up against the wall.
[00:54:54.673 --> 00:54:57.275]  We can't afford, you know, four more years of this.
[00:54:57.275 --> 00:55:00.937]  And I'm just, I'm really worried about this election.
[00:55:00.937 --> 00:55:05.941]  How about a 20 plus percent carbon tax that kicks in this year when everybody's already leaving California?
[00:55:05.941 --> 00:55:07.542]  I appreciate your call.
[00:55:07.542 --> 00:55:12.105]  And people are like, why would the government raise taxes when they know that stalls economies?
[00:55:12.105 --> 00:55:16.748]  Because the big mega insiders want to shut down everybody else.
[00:55:18.149 --> 00:55:20.471]  Yeah, why did Napoleon burn whole countries?
[00:55:20.471 --> 00:55:22.192]  Because he was taking over!
[00:55:22.192 --> 00:55:24.234]  Why did Hitler do that?
[00:55:24.234 --> 00:55:26.095]  It's called scorched earth, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:55:26.095 --> 00:55:27.996]  Let's jam in one more before we go to the second hour.
[00:55:27.996 --> 00:55:33.040]  I'll continue with calls till these are off the board, then I'm gonna get to all the news, but I'm taking calls right now.
[00:55:33.040 --> 00:55:35.042]  Kevin in New York, you're on the air, welcome.
[00:55:36.391 --> 00:55:39.234]  First time caller, long time listener, thanks for everything.
[00:55:39.234 --> 00:55:58.271]  I was listening to the New York CBS AM affiliate last week, and they were talking about on their business report how if the Wall Street executives don't get their big bonuses, that's going to have a detrimental effect on the local economy here in the tri-state area, which is something you hear about every year for the last quarter century.
[00:55:58.271 --> 00:56:01.814]  And I live alone, and I go into this Alex Jones style rant.
[00:56:02.154 --> 00:56:20.193]  Where I just, you know, say it's because they're getting the bonuses, because they're selling this toxic derivative garbage, that it's a big detriment to our economy to begin with, and not, you know, this by-product, oh, if they don't get their bonuses... Well, let me crystallize it, and then we'll hold you over if we need you to have you finished, but for listeners, just tune in.
[00:56:20.936 --> 00:56:22.077]  They simplify it.
[00:56:22.077 --> 00:56:24.159]  Oh, you're a commie for Occupy Wall Street.
[00:56:24.159 --> 00:56:26.681]  I'm not saying they're all commies, but that's what the media says.
[00:56:26.681 --> 00:56:33.166]  Either you're that or you're a, you know, Rush Limbaugh Republican and corporations can do no wrong.
[00:56:33.166 --> 00:56:35.428]  The truth is there's a third rail.
[00:56:35.428 --> 00:56:41.473]  It's mega insiders that get government bailouts to then pay bonuses
[00:56:42.313 --> 00:56:48.900]  That's what the real Occupy Wall Street people are concerned about, but the media always says they don't know what they want.
[00:56:48.900 --> 00:56:50.081]  That's not really true.
[00:56:50.081 --> 00:56:53.945]  They're not talking to the people I have that actually understand it.
[00:56:53.945 --> 00:56:57.849]  So I'm all for somebody getting a bonus off a company that did well and a stock that did well.
[00:56:58.109 --> 00:57:07.691]  But most of those big firms are getting bonuses from bailouts and from selling people timber wool stock they knew was complete garbage.
[00:57:07.691 --> 00:57:08.771]  Fraud!
[00:57:08.771 --> 00:57:21.694]  That's not free market, that's going to destroy our free market and the socialists are going to scapegoat the free market for what the crony capitalists have done and get rid of the entire free market system that's made this country so great.
[00:57:21.694 --> 00:57:23.594]  And so that's why when I hear fake
[00:57:23.974 --> 00:57:36.219]  Neocons, all over talk radio, bought and paid for by Bain Capital that owns them, and all the rest of them, you know, that's the folks with Mitt Romney, telling you that, oh no, anybody that's mad about bailouts is bad.
[00:57:36.219 --> 00:57:37.139]  Bailouts?
[00:57:37.139 --> 00:57:42.081]  That's corporate welfare of my tax money, of big mega banks that are against my country.
[00:57:42.081 --> 00:57:44.482]  Caller, I'm going to come back to you right after this break.
[00:57:44.482 --> 00:57:45.262]  We'll be right back.

[00:58:02.846 --> 00:58:17.593]  There's a place down in Tennessee Where they make blue diamond gusset jeans They sew pride in every stitch Guarantee you'll love the way they fit
[00:58:19.929 --> 00:58:24.651]  They put a Diamond Gusset in the crotch where you need it most.
[00:58:24.651 --> 00:58:28.493]  Blue Diamond Gussets got it.
[00:58:28.493 --> 00:58:29.734]  Others don't.
[00:58:29.734 --> 00:58:31.875]  We turn jeans inside out.
[00:58:31.875 --> 00:58:33.656]  Diamond Gusset Jeans.

[00:58:45.862 --> 00:58:48.243]  Diamond Gusset Jeans got it.
[00:58:48.243 --> 00:58:48.724]  Others don't.
[00:58:50.285 --> 00:58:54.828]  This is Alex Jones with 5 good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[00:58:54.828 --> 00:58:55.749]  Number 1.
[00:58:55.749 --> 00:58:59.172]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[00:58:59.172 --> 00:59:00.032]  Number 2.
[00:59:00.032 --> 00:59:04.916]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[00:59:04.916 --> 00:59:05.656]  It's true.
[00:59:05.656 --> 00:59:10.540]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[00:59:10.540 --> 00:59:11.361]  Number 3.
[00:59:11.361 --> 00:59:14.943]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[00:59:14.943 --> 00:59:18.646]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[00:59:18.846 --> 00:59:19.647]  Number 4.
[00:59:19.647 --> 00:59:22.410]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[00:59:22.410 --> 00:59:26.094]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[00:59:26.094 --> 00:59:26.874]  Number 5.
[00:59:26.874 --> 00:59:31.039]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[00:59:31.039 --> 00:59:35.784]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[00:59:36.064 --> 00:59:40.246]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[00:59:40.246 --> 00:59:42.027]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[00:59:42.027 --> 00:59:44.288]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun.
[00:59:44.288 --> 00:59:46.889]  So go to mysolarbackup.com or call 1-877-327-0365.
[00:59:46.889 --> 00:59:52.952]  Coast to Coast.
[00:59:52.952 --> 00:59:54.993]  Direct from Austin.
[00:59:54.993 --> 00:59:58.194]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network.
[01:00:02.065 --> 01:00:08.692]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[01:00:08.692 --> 01:00:12.696]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:12.696 --> 01:00:16.680]  The Global Social Engineer Crime Syndicate zombie controllers.
[01:00:19.483 --> 01:00:29.787]  Always use the crises they create or help expand as a pretext for more power for themselves with simplistic solutions for the public.
[01:00:29.787 --> 01:00:34.629]  But yeah, you read about the average secretary on Wall Street getting about a million bucks a year or more.
[01:00:34.629 --> 01:00:38.230]  I think I saw 1.1 million was the number last year.
[01:00:38.230 --> 01:00:46.433]  And you read about the stockbrokers and people, some of them getting billions a year, brokerage firm owners.
[01:00:47.560 --> 01:00:48.621]  And I went and looked at it.
[01:00:48.621 --> 01:00:50.062]  Most of that is stolen.
[01:00:50.062 --> 01:00:50.943]  It's derivatives.
[01:00:50.943 --> 01:00:51.763]  It's crud.
[01:00:51.763 --> 01:00:52.824]  It's bubble.
[01:00:52.824 --> 01:00:53.845]  It's bailout money.
[01:00:53.845 --> 01:00:55.587]  I mean, we've all seen the numbers.
[01:00:55.587 --> 01:00:58.889]  And then you never hear it on talk radio.
[01:00:58.889 --> 01:01:03.853]  Now, it's all about some welfare mom who's got five kids and is on welfare.
[01:01:03.853 --> 01:01:04.474]  And I agree.
[01:01:04.474 --> 01:01:06.295]  Giving them the welfare helped create that.
[01:01:06.295 --> 01:01:07.516]  So why did the system do that?
[01:01:07.516 --> 01:01:11.440]  To create a dependent group to vote and leverage out people that don't.
[01:01:12.423 --> 01:01:19.586]  But, again, the Democrats are bought and paid for by the system, the Republican leadership is bought and paid for, and it's a nightmare.
[01:01:19.586 --> 01:01:22.088]  But you've got the floor there, Kevin, and we want to break.
[01:01:22.088 --> 01:01:23.248]  Go ahead.
[01:01:23.248 --> 01:01:33.873]  Yeah, and, you know, just on top of that, I'm going through my own Orwellian nightmare up in Connecticut, where I have an ex-girlfriend who took my car without knowledge or permission, destroys it.
[01:01:33.873 --> 01:01:34.594]  She was drunk.
[01:01:34.594 --> 01:01:37.015]  The state trooper's a complete incompetent moron.
[01:01:37.015 --> 01:01:39.336]  He doesn't give her a field sobriety test or
[01:01:39.796 --> 01:01:44.177]  By the way, I want to tell Chris and the other producers in there to make sure I cover this before the end of the show.
[01:01:44.177 --> 01:01:45.057]  I have a whole stack here about
[01:02:07.080 --> 01:02:12.205]  What the stupid ignorance of this society is causing.
[01:02:12.205 --> 01:02:18.030]  Because, you know, we had corrupt elites 30 years ago, but they wouldn't let the military use depleted uranium.
[01:02:18.030 --> 01:02:23.635]  We had a corrupt elite 25 years ago with Chernobyl, but they told people to take precautions.
[01:02:23.635 --> 01:02:27.058]  And I've got a whole stack here just where they don't care now.
[01:02:27.950 --> 01:02:41.455]  The system just doesn't care, and I have an article where thousands of people, the LA Times reports, are arrested for sex crimes, robberies, you name it, and their name isn't even similar!
[01:02:41.455 --> 01:02:48.397]  And they show the cops, and the cops say, this is the address, I'm taking you to jail, and sometimes you spend months in there.
[01:02:49.693 --> 01:02:50.774]  And it doesn't matter.
[01:02:50.774 --> 01:03:00.222]  I mean, things are breaking down because everybody passes the buck because they're too busy on their iPhone, you know, talking to their buddies.
[01:03:00.222 --> 01:03:04.185]  And a lot of it is the complexity of the world.
[01:03:04.185 --> 01:03:08.789]  We spend so much time doing little knick-knack stuff that we don't spend any time in reality.
[01:03:08.789 --> 01:03:10.010]  I appreciate that information.
[01:03:10.010 --> 01:03:10.950]  Thank you, Kevin.
[01:03:10.950 --> 01:03:11.951]  Sean in Pennsylvania.
[01:03:11.951 --> 01:03:12.592]  You got a minute and a half.
[01:03:12.592 --> 01:03:13.152]  We're going to break.
[01:03:13.152 --> 01:03:13.733]  Thank you for calling.
[01:03:16.969 --> 01:03:18.030]  Sean, you're on the air.
[01:03:18.030 --> 01:03:18.730]  Welcome, sir.
[01:03:18.730 --> 01:03:19.791]  Good to talk to you today.
[01:03:19.791 --> 01:03:22.513]  Hi, Alex.
[01:03:22.513 --> 01:03:23.093]  Go ahead, brother.
[01:03:23.093 --> 01:03:25.395]  Hi.
[01:03:25.395 --> 01:03:29.557]  I just wanted to bring up a couple quick points here.
[01:03:29.557 --> 01:03:35.081]  Today at 6, Senator Halm Davis is bringing a big endorsement for Ron Paul.
[01:03:35.081 --> 01:03:36.622]  Oh, good!
[01:03:36.622 --> 01:03:40.384]  And I want to talk about some newspaper propaganda.
[01:03:41.863 --> 01:03:53.711]  Lately, I've been looking at a lot of newspapers around the country, and they either discount Ron Paul altogether, or they just, you know, whatever they say about him is just completely wrong.
[01:03:53.711 --> 01:04:00.636]  And, uh, well, the older folks of the country, they're the ones that, you know, mostly listen, you know, read the newspapers and all.
[01:04:00.636 --> 01:04:05.379]  And, uh, they're just getting bad information about him.
[01:04:05.379 --> 01:04:08.842]  And, uh, also, I live here in Pittsburgh, and, uh, Ron Paul was born here.
[01:04:09.446 --> 01:04:12.388]  Well, that's never mentioned at all in the local media.
[01:04:12.388 --> 01:04:16.612]  If they... No, I mean, if they're forced to talk about him, it's always negative.
[01:04:16.612 --> 01:04:17.933]  Yeah, sure.
[01:04:17.933 --> 01:04:19.814]  And, uh, one last point I wanted to make.
[01:04:19.814 --> 01:04:24.838]  Fox News is reporting in South Carolina is having a closed primary.
[01:04:24.838 --> 01:04:27.720]  And, uh, you know, that's just not true either.
[01:04:27.720 --> 01:04:30.742]  And it's up on YouTube now.
[01:04:30.742 --> 01:04:35.226]  Three pundits talking about, you know, it's a closed primary and whatever.
[01:04:35.226 --> 01:04:36.447]  And that's also not true.
[01:04:37.776 --> 01:04:40.118]  Well, and they're running dirty tricks against Ron Paul.
[01:04:40.118 --> 01:04:41.039]  Great run down there.
[01:04:41.039 --> 01:04:43.441]  Thank you so much, my friend.
[01:04:43.441 --> 01:04:44.642]  They're in a PA.
[01:04:44.642 --> 01:04:47.705]  Alright, Mario, Tommy, Zach, James, Robert, Susan.
[01:04:47.705 --> 01:04:48.926]  Your call's straight ahead.
[01:04:48.926 --> 01:04:54.151]  Then I'm getting into all that world news I talked about, including indefinite detention.
[01:04:54.151 --> 01:04:56.734]  There's been some new developments on that front.
[01:05:00.666 --> 01:05:02.368]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones.
[01:05:02.368 --> 01:05:07.675]  I'm looking for people that have the wisdom to spot savings, opportunity, and recognize risk.
[01:05:07.675 --> 01:05:09.218]  Saving means to make money.
[01:05:09.218 --> 01:05:18.009]  The Cal Bend Pure Soap Company can save you thousands of dollars and give you good old-fashioned real soaps that are triple concentrated and twice as good as what you're using now.
[01:05:18.730 --> 01:05:26.253]  Soaps made from vegetable and coconut oils that contain no useless dyes, perfumes, deodorants, or antibacterials.
[01:05:26.253 --> 01:05:34.256]  Your risk is the hundreds of hazardous toxic detergents that give you rashes, itching sores, and deteriorating clothing called lint.
[01:05:34.256 --> 01:05:39.498]  If you want something better, if you want something you've never had before, you have to do something you've never done before.
[01:05:39.498 --> 01:05:41.659]  Getting a free catalog is easy by calling 800-340-7091.
[01:05:44.380 --> 01:05:47.040]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[01:06:22.279 --> 01:06:29.161]  Waging war on corruption, crashing through the lies and disinformation.
[01:06:29.161 --> 01:06:30.542]  I'm your host, Alex Jones.
[01:06:30.542 --> 01:06:31.382]  Thank you for joining us.
[01:06:31.382 --> 01:06:33.683]  We're here every Sunday, 4 to 6.
[01:06:33.683 --> 01:06:36.603]  Back weekdays, 11 to 2 Central.
[01:06:36.603 --> 01:06:40.105]  Websites are PrisonPlanet.com and Infowars.com.
[01:06:40.105 --> 01:06:44.526]  We're fighting the establishment of a prison planet via the InfoWar.
[01:06:45.902 --> 01:06:47.683]  Now, look, here's the deal.
[01:06:47.683 --> 01:06:49.785]  I've already taken seven or eight calls.
[01:06:49.785 --> 01:06:56.410]  We've got a computerized phone system, and I can just open it up for a minute or two and get dozens of calls.
[01:06:56.410 --> 01:06:58.132]  All the great listeners out there.
[01:06:58.132 --> 01:07:07.259]  But you notice when I open the phones up for two minutes last hour, and we got more than 20 calls in, none of them disagree with me so far.
[01:07:08.382 --> 01:07:12.927]  Show, I'm going to take calls quickly right now and finish up with who was on this board.
[01:07:12.927 --> 01:07:14.709]  Then I'm going to open the phones up.
[01:07:14.709 --> 01:07:16.691]  Like, I'm going to do it right now.
[01:07:16.691 --> 01:07:18.633]  Only for people that disagree with me.
[01:07:18.633 --> 01:07:22.778]  Because that's always informative, entertaining, thought-provoking.
[01:07:22.778 --> 01:07:23.979]  Certainly gets my pulse up.
[01:07:24.821 --> 01:07:25.861]  Because I know I'm right.
[01:07:25.861 --> 01:07:28.722]  I've done the research and I always find it comical.
[01:07:28.722 --> 01:07:29.862]  I'm sorry.
[01:07:29.862 --> 01:07:34.163]  I just want to hear from those of you that think I'm making stuff up or that I'm wrong.
[01:07:34.163 --> 01:07:35.083]  It's always fun.
[01:07:35.083 --> 01:07:44.705]  And if you got the huevos or cojones or whatever you call them, the boiled eggs to call into the show, I'll be friendly to you.
[01:07:44.705 --> 01:07:45.785]  I'd like to hear from you.
[01:07:45.785 --> 01:07:48.765]  Only people that disagree after I take these calls and then cover news.
[01:07:48.765 --> 01:07:50.786]  And I'll go back to those of you that disagree.
[01:07:50.786 --> 01:07:52.466]  I got a lot of news I want to get to as promised.
[01:07:53.306 --> 01:07:54.267]  Let me give you the number, it's 877-789-ALEX, 877-789-2539.
[01:07:54.267 --> 01:07:57.891]  Folks that disagree, I understand, have a little too much fluoride and vaccines, so I have to say it slow.
[01:07:57.891 --> 01:08:02.075]  For those of you that disagree, 877, on the phone, you go doo-doo-doo-doo.
[01:08:02.075 --> 01:08:03.075]  Okay, let me say, 877-789-ALEX.
[01:08:21.911 --> 01:08:24.211]  Alex.
[01:08:24.211 --> 01:08:26.191]  877-789-2539.
[01:08:26.191 --> 01:08:35.033]  And that's where you talk to the bad man who doesn't think the government's nicey-nice.
[01:08:35.033 --> 01:08:45.975]  I don't believe in the Easter Bunny, or Spider-Man, or Keebler Elves, or Chupacabras, or Bat-Guano,
[01:08:48.283 --> 01:08:48.823]  Santa Claus.
[01:08:48.823 --> 01:08:51.405]  I'm what you call Al Qaeda.
[01:08:51.405 --> 01:08:52.585]  But you can call in.
[01:08:52.585 --> 01:08:54.006]  I'm the bad man.
[01:08:54.006 --> 01:08:55.027]  I'd like to hear from you.
[01:08:55.027 --> 01:08:55.767]  There's the challenge.
[01:08:55.767 --> 01:08:57.128]  You disagree, call in.
[01:08:57.128 --> 01:09:00.409]  Well, I'll just have whole weeks where it's nothing but my enemies.
[01:09:00.409 --> 01:09:07.033]  It'll be like, I heard you work for the aliens.
[01:09:07.033 --> 01:09:07.973]  Okay, I'm out of control.
[01:09:07.973 --> 01:09:08.874]  It is true.
[01:09:08.874 --> 01:09:10.095]  It is true.
[01:09:10.095 --> 01:09:11.896]  Mario in Minnesota, you're on the air.
[01:09:11.896 --> 01:09:12.396]  Welcome, sir.
[01:09:13.772 --> 01:09:15.753]  Hey, thank you, Alex, for having me on the show.
[01:09:15.753 --> 01:09:16.873]  Welcome!
[01:09:16.873 --> 01:09:22.276]  I'm a local pawnbroker in town, and right before Christmas, I always listen to your show at work.
[01:09:22.276 --> 01:09:30.400]  And I had a customer come in to pawn one of his rifles, and he happened to be a Iraq vet, and one who is also in the guards right now.
[01:09:30.400 --> 01:09:40.704]  And I asked him about the NDAA bill, and he wanted to tell me that they say that they're going to be under domestic operations within the United States within the next two years.
[01:09:40.704 --> 01:09:42.445]  That's what they said they're planning for at the base.
[01:09:43.081 --> 01:09:46.223]  And they said they're going to be doing the same types of things that they did in Iraq.
[01:09:46.223 --> 01:09:48.385]  Yeah, well that guy thinks he's got some secret info.
[01:09:48.385 --> 01:09:52.628]  That's actually Army Times and Stars and Stripes.
[01:09:52.628 --> 01:09:56.871]  And yeah, no, they're training to lock down cities, door-to-door gun confiscation.
[01:09:56.871 --> 01:09:59.714]  They're going to stop you at checkpoints, retina scan you.
[01:09:59.714 --> 01:10:04.417]  They've already got, as I told you a decade ago, but now it's here at TSA checkpoints all over the country.
[01:10:04.417 --> 01:10:07.499]  You pull up and the feds are commanding local police and
[01:10:08.460 --> 01:10:10.321]  In some cases, hand goes down the pants.
[01:10:10.321 --> 01:10:12.081]  I mean, it's an act of total submission.
[01:10:12.081 --> 01:10:19.423]  In fact, the symbol of America shouldn't be red, white, and blue, but it's a five-year-old being groped by a pot-bellied pedophile at a checkpoint.
[01:10:19.423 --> 01:10:22.664]  I mean, that should be the American flag, is a pedophile groping a child.
[01:10:22.664 --> 01:10:25.545]  For their safety, of course, because Al-Qaeda might get you.
[01:10:25.545 --> 01:10:30.046]  Of course, the government runs Al-Qaeda and gave them control of Libya, but you're not supposed to talk about that.
[01:10:31.132 --> 01:10:32.232]  But what else did he say?
[01:10:32.232 --> 01:10:34.193]  Was he pretty excited about that?
[01:10:34.193 --> 01:10:42.136]  Pretty excited about being sent out to get the guns, which is basically a... Well, it's like playing in traffic on Interstate Highway.
[01:10:42.136 --> 01:10:43.316]  Absolutely not, Alex.
[01:10:43.316 --> 01:10:49.478]  He's actually an Alex listener, and he totally disagrees, and so do a lot of... So he doesn't want to stick his hand in a lion's mouth.
[01:10:49.478 --> 01:10:53.600]  He doesn't want to stick his hand in a blender, jump off a cliff, or jump into a propeller.
[01:10:53.600 --> 01:10:54.600]  He actually has a brain.
[01:10:56.216 --> 01:10:56.797]  Absolutely.
[01:10:56.797 --> 01:10:58.639]  He does have a brain.
[01:10:58.639 --> 01:11:03.004]  I have several friends and cousins who have been in Iraq and they're all waking up too.
[01:11:03.004 --> 01:11:04.706]  They're all big Ron Paul supporters.
[01:11:05.475 --> 01:11:12.198]  Well, Ron Paul does get, last time I checked, 74% of all military donations for both parties for presidential candidates.
[01:11:12.198 --> 01:11:20.702]  But then the media, the so-called media, because they're arrogant and have big teleprompters and fancy sets, they say the military hates Ron Paul.
[01:11:20.702 --> 01:11:25.924]  Of course, he just got 70-plus percent of all their money, and the military is waking up.
[01:11:25.924 --> 01:11:34.708]  That's why the secret Homeland Security documents that we released now three and a half years ago, the Midnational News, the government admitted are theirs, say they're not even talking about
[01:11:35.328 --> 01:11:43.036]  Al Qaeda, they're talking about veterans as the number one enemy, and the next is conservatives and libertarians.
[01:11:43.036 --> 01:11:54.106]  So all of you out there better understand, the mega-corporations want communism in America, and a red terror to break your will, and then the new government they put in will suck the money offshore to them.
[01:11:54.867 --> 01:11:58.628]  So you better understand the megabanks are the commies.
[01:11:58.628 --> 01:12:02.089]  And you better understand they're the enemies or there's no future.
[01:12:02.089 --> 01:12:06.250]  Well, that's exciting news that your family and folks coming in are awake.
[01:12:06.250 --> 01:12:07.490]  That's what I'm seeing.
[01:12:07.490 --> 01:12:09.771]  And that's why the globalists are a paper tiger.
[01:12:09.771 --> 01:12:11.671]  All we got to do is call their bluff, my friend.
[01:12:11.671 --> 01:12:14.472]  Thank you, Alex.
[01:12:14.472 --> 01:12:15.492]  Thank you very much.
[01:12:15.492 --> 01:12:16.613]  God bless you.
[01:12:16.613 --> 01:12:17.993]  God bless you, Mario.
[01:12:19.104 --> 01:12:41.417]  Because I'm going to tell you, I was in that barbecue joint last night with my family to get some of that good German barbecue, and I'm sitting there, and I'm eating barbecue, and I'm listening to people howl and scream and bug their eyes up and full-grown men stand up with their fists clenched, bulging their eyes out with veins in their neck over touchdowns.
[01:12:41.417 --> 01:12:47.401]  And I wanted to go to them and I wanted to say, all that male energy is to defend your family and your country!
[01:12:49.158 --> 01:12:50.399]  But I knew better.
[01:12:50.399 --> 01:12:54.501]  So see, I get fired up here like I'm in a football game, but I apologize.
[01:12:54.501 --> 01:12:56.542]  It's not over something that doesn't matter.
[01:12:56.542 --> 01:12:59.443]  It's over something that totally matters.
[01:12:59.443 --> 01:13:05.947]  And that's why I'm in competition against sports for people's energy and their awakening.
[01:13:05.947 --> 01:13:10.889]  We need all those energies you feel in sports that the social engineers are programming.
[01:13:10.889 --> 01:13:13.991]  That's really for private property and family rights.
[01:13:15.999 --> 01:13:20.603]  It was those energies getting excited about freedom that created the Republic.
[01:13:20.603 --> 01:13:21.544]  Let's jam in one more.
[01:13:21.544 --> 01:13:24.046]  I got time.
[01:13:24.046 --> 01:13:25.787]  Tommy in Kentucky, you're on the air.
[01:13:25.787 --> 01:13:26.248]  Go ahead.
[01:13:26.248 --> 01:13:30.411]  Yeah, thanks for taking my call, Alex.
[01:13:30.411 --> 01:13:30.832]  Welcome.
[01:13:30.832 --> 01:13:35.516]  With the sports analogies, I feel like the momentum is definitely shifting.
[01:13:35.516 --> 01:13:39.379]  I mean, I think that's apparently Ron Paul and what the media is trying to do with him.
[01:13:40.160 --> 01:13:42.842]  I mean, they're doing everything they can to hold him back.
[01:13:42.842 --> 01:13:45.204]  And I'll use another game changer and hold you over if need be.
[01:13:45.204 --> 01:13:47.506]  I don't want to shortchange you, but a timeout here.
[01:13:47.506 --> 01:13:48.106]  Exactly.
[01:13:48.106 --> 01:13:56.572]  And Ron Paul is a new philosophy of football, as they've had many that replace the old school, that is going to be the winning philosophy in the future.
[01:13:56.572 --> 01:13:59.434]  And so it doesn't matter if he doesn't win this Super Bowl.
[01:13:59.434 --> 01:14:07.280]  He's developing a program and a system that is going to prove to be a winner in the future, which is actually taking us back to the old republic form.
[01:14:07.280 --> 01:14:09.322]  And that's why playing and resisting
[01:14:09.762 --> 01:14:22.213]  It's clearing the debate that he, you know, he has logic and truth behind what he's saying and, you know, you just can't compete with that and once you see the truth you can't turn back and away from it.
[01:14:30.663 --> 01:14:31.444]  They don't win.
[01:14:31.444 --> 01:14:32.064]  Absolutely.
[01:14:32.064 --> 01:14:33.186]  I have a couple suggestions for you.
[01:14:51.198 --> 01:14:57.223]  I was frustrated and like, I don't know, I guess angry at what they were doing with Ron Paul at first, but then it hit me, you know?
[01:14:57.223 --> 01:15:04.828]  I mean, they're giving us the tools to take them down and there can be a heck of a documentary made with what they're doing to Ron Paul.
[01:15:04.828 --> 01:15:06.630]  I mean, it's just all out there in the open.
[01:15:06.630 --> 01:15:09.952]  You know, all you gotta do is pull together the clips and, you know, we got them.
[01:15:09.952 --> 01:15:11.333]  I mean, you can totally take them down.
[01:15:11.333 --> 01:15:12.414]  I mean, they're ready to go.
[01:15:13.946 --> 01:15:18.929]  And also, I'd like to suggest a guest for you, Richard Grove.
[01:15:18.929 --> 01:15:31.557]  He's buddies with Corbett Report and Jan Ervin, and I think, you know, studying the trivium and quadrivium, I think that's a good foundation for people whenever they're arguing with other people.
[01:15:31.557 --> 01:15:33.258]  I think Richard Grove has been on.
[01:15:33.258 --> 01:15:36.520]  You're talking about basic Greek logic?
[01:15:36.520 --> 01:15:37.721]  Yeah, yeah, all that stuff.
[01:15:37.721 --> 01:15:42.004]  I mean, it's simple, but it's super-duper effective in arguing with
[01:15:43.688 --> 01:15:49.573]  Yeah, because in an age of universal deceit, telling the truth is a revolutionary act.
[01:15:49.573 --> 01:15:50.794]  Great points, my friend.
[01:15:50.794 --> 01:15:53.897]  Okay, I gotta stop with calls for now.
[01:15:53.897 --> 01:15:55.618]  I gotta hit some news.
[01:15:55.618 --> 01:15:59.862]  I got callers that are general callers, and I have three little disagreeers.
[01:16:01.917 --> 01:16:05.941]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[01:16:05.941 --> 01:16:09.185]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[01:16:09.185 --> 01:16:13.990]  As we're finishing off this agenda, they'll be pulling the rug from underneath the Americans at home.
[01:16:13.990 --> 01:16:20.377]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[01:16:20.377 --> 01:16:22.620]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us
[01:16:23.160 --> 01:16:23.460]  Tim Geithner?
[01:16:23.460 --> 01:16:23.960]  Bernanke?
[01:16:23.960 --> 01:16:24.641]  They're arsonists!
[01:16:24.641 --> 01:16:25.921]  They're asking for more matches!
[01:16:25.921 --> 01:16:28.162]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[01:16:42.048 --> 01:16:49.333]  Today seems like nobody does care and right now in Washington DC we have seen a fall of the republic.

[01:17:00.615 --> 01:17:04.760]  Did you ever think you'd be where you are, a decade into the 21st century?
[01:17:04.760 --> 01:17:08.905]  Record foreclosure rates for homes, if not yours, your neighbor's.
[01:17:08.905 --> 01:17:11.869]  Thankful for the unemployment check since you were laid off.
[01:17:11.869 --> 01:17:18.357]  And placing your child's name on the angel tree in hopes of a Christmas gift, along with thousands of other Americans.
[01:17:18.857 --> 01:17:22.079]  Did you ever think your future would feel this out of control?
[01:17:22.079 --> 01:17:27.302]  The fact is, in all this craziness, there's only one thing you can control.
[01:17:27.302 --> 01:17:28.842]  Your greatest dependency.
[01:17:28.842 --> 01:17:30.263]  Your food supply.
[01:17:30.263 --> 01:17:34.445]  Make 2012 the year you take control by getting prepared.
[01:17:34.445 --> 01:17:38.728]  eFoods Direct introduces the best way to build your food supply in the 21st century.
[01:17:39.668 --> 01:17:39.888]  We're good.
[01:18:01.365 --> 01:18:03.067]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones.
[01:18:03.067 --> 01:18:08.373]  I'm looking for people that have the wisdom to spot savings, opportunity, and recognize risk.
[01:18:08.373 --> 01:18:09.915]  Saving means to make money.
[01:18:09.915 --> 01:18:18.705]  The Cal Bend Pure Soap Company can save you thousands of dollars and give you good old-fashioned real soaps that are triple concentrated and twice as good as what you're using now.
[01:18:19.426 --> 01:18:26.970]  Soaps made from vegetable and coconut oils that contain no useless dyes, perfumes, deodorants, or antibacterials.
[01:18:26.970 --> 01:18:34.975]  Your risk is the hundreds of hazardous toxic detergents that give you rashes, itching sores, and deteriorating clothing called lint.
[01:18:34.975 --> 01:18:40.197]  If you want something better, if you want something you've never had before, you have to do something you've never done before.

[01:19:00.063 --> 01:19:01.363]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[01:19:01.363 --> 01:19:06.965]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[01:19:06.965 --> 01:19:11.967]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds can become more valuable than silver or gold?
[01:19:11.967 --> 01:19:12.447]  It's true.
[01:19:12.447 --> 01:19:17.009]  Seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country, and it's possible that could even happen again.
[01:19:17.549 --> 01:19:22.773]  So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds.
[01:19:22.773 --> 01:19:25.094]  They call it a Survival Seed Bank.
[01:19:25.094 --> 01:19:29.897]  And it can produce an endless supply of nutrient-dense food for you and your family.
[01:19:29.897 --> 01:19:31.018]  And here's the best part.

[01:20:29.665 --> 01:20:30.085]  He's next!
[01:20:30.085 --> 01:20:31.546]  Escape from the prison planet!
[01:20:31.546 --> 01:20:31.986]  Get him!
[01:20:35.183 --> 01:20:37.845]  Monday through Friday, we're here 11 a.m.
[01:20:37.845 --> 01:20:39.066]  to 2 p.m.
[01:20:39.066 --> 01:20:43.590]  We have a free iPhone app and other apps as well at InfoWars.com, the listen button.
[01:20:43.590 --> 01:20:50.796]  You can find out more there, or you can listen to the free podcast, the audio streams there, or on your local AM or FM affiliate.
[01:20:50.796 --> 01:20:53.539]  And we're getting about three new affiliates a week in the last year.
[01:20:54.983 --> 01:20:59.347]  Now, some get sold or changed, but we're well over 100 affiliates now.
[01:20:59.347 --> 01:21:00.748]  Very, very exciting.
[01:21:00.748 --> 01:21:02.450]  Okay, here's the deal.
[01:21:02.450 --> 01:21:09.396]  I got a bunch of regular callers that I don't know what they're calling about because we don't screen your calls, but I did say if you disagree, you're welcome to call in.
[01:21:09.396 --> 01:21:10.277]  We got three of them.
[01:21:10.277 --> 01:21:15.421]  One from New Zealand, one from closer to home, Texas, and one from New York.
[01:21:15.421 --> 01:21:16.702]  New York City?
[01:21:17.483 --> 01:21:18.464]  I'm just joking.
[01:21:18.464 --> 01:21:22.826]  I love folks from New York, but that is a funny pace PicanteSauce had.
[01:21:22.826 --> 01:21:28.509]  And so we'll go to your calls, then I'll get into the news, into the next segment news, then back into the regular callers.
[01:21:28.509 --> 01:21:31.491]  But, I will say this.
[01:21:31.491 --> 01:21:34.833]  Almost every time I take calls that disagree, they never bring up real issues.
[01:21:35.933 --> 01:21:38.934]  Or they bring up personal issues or side issues.
[01:21:38.934 --> 01:21:45.197]  I mean, I wish it was about the fact that we're losing our liberties and going into tyranny and that's not a good idea.
[01:21:45.197 --> 01:21:47.257]  I mean, who can deny that now?
[01:21:47.257 --> 01:21:51.479]  With the government saying, yeah, we'll arrest citizens secretly and kill you if we want.
[01:21:51.479 --> 01:21:53.080]  I mean, that's the essence!
[01:21:54.420 --> 01:21:55.620]  of a corrupt government.
[01:21:55.620 --> 01:21:57.801]  But, they obviously disagree.
[01:21:57.801 --> 01:22:04.003]  Let's go to Kiwiland, beautiful emerald isle of New Zealand, to talk to Chris.
[01:22:04.003 --> 01:22:06.924]  Chris, what time is it in New Zealand?
[01:22:06.924 --> 01:22:10.745]  I'm at, I'm twelve twenty-one p- a.m.
[01:22:10.745 --> 01:22:13.606]  s- p.m., yeah, p.m., sorry.
[01:22:13.606 --> 01:22:17.047]  It's noon, but you've had so much liquor that you're not sure.
[01:22:17.047 --> 01:22:19.088]  Okay, you're calling us from New Zealand, sir, go ahead.
[01:22:19.909 --> 01:22:23.792]  Yeah, I'm just wondering, um, why will this affect New Zealand in a way?
[01:22:23.792 --> 01:22:26.174]  Because it's all about USA, for instance.
[01:22:26.174 --> 01:22:35.580]  Why is it not about any other country like, um, Australia or New Zealand or, um, Japan or anything?
[01:22:35.580 --> 01:22:39.723]  It's all about America and how it's a big country.
[01:22:39.723 --> 01:22:42.245]  Are you sure it's all about America?
[01:22:42.245 --> 01:22:44.847]  Are you sure it's not about these other countries as well?
[01:22:44.847 --> 01:22:48.770]  Sir, I'm going to be honest with you, and I want to hear your point.
[01:22:50.818 --> 01:22:53.240]  Before I say this, I want to hear your point.
[01:22:53.240 --> 01:22:56.622]  Are you saying that I'm not blaming America enough?
[01:22:56.622 --> 01:23:00.325]  And I'm not pointing out that it's mainly the U.S.
[01:23:00.325 --> 01:23:01.906]  that is the main military muscle?
[01:23:01.906 --> 01:23:04.128]  I mean, specifically, what do you disagree with?
[01:23:05.282 --> 01:23:09.743]  I disagree that you're blaming America for everything.
[01:23:09.743 --> 01:23:13.524]  Hey, America could have something white for a change, you know?
[01:23:13.524 --> 01:23:21.166]  Why don't you just put a blame as well, not just Americans, why not any other countries as well?
[01:23:21.166 --> 01:23:22.146]  Oh, so it's the opposite.
[01:23:22.146 --> 01:23:24.307]  You're saying, I'm blaming America and I shouldn't.
[01:23:25.649 --> 01:23:27.511]  Don't blame America too much.
[01:23:27.511 --> 01:23:34.678]  See, you're like, I'm saying America this, America that, and why America... Stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop.
[01:23:34.678 --> 01:23:35.618]  I can't understand you.
[01:23:35.618 --> 01:23:43.386]  I don't know if it's whether you had too much Jameson's or whatever it is, but are you saying I blame America too much or I'm not blaming America enough?
[01:23:44.286 --> 01:23:46.027]  You're blaming America too much.
[01:24:01.272 --> 01:24:03.274]  None of the booty out of this.
[01:24:03.274 --> 01:24:06.156]  I'm explaining it's a global corporate government.
[01:24:06.156 --> 01:24:08.438]  I want my republic back.
[01:24:08.438 --> 01:24:11.941]  I support George Washington, who said don't have foreign entanglements.
[01:24:11.941 --> 01:24:16.204]  I support Ron Paul, who wants to get us out of all these wars.
[01:24:16.204 --> 01:24:20.288]  Now, to you, is that blaming America, if I don't want to be in all these wars?
[01:24:21.994 --> 01:24:26.657]  Um, yes or no, because, um, it's all about America, you know?
[01:24:26.657 --> 01:24:28.639]  You're talking all about America.
[01:24:28.639 --> 01:24:30.300]  Yes, I know you live in America.
[01:24:30.300 --> 01:24:33.282]  Is there any other country we can talk about as well?
[01:24:33.282 --> 01:24:37.044]  Like, for instance, let's say here, like, Australia?
[01:24:37.044 --> 01:24:40.747]  I want to ask you, so you're from New Zealand your whole life?
[01:24:40.747 --> 01:24:42.648]  Yep, that's correct.
[01:24:42.648 --> 01:24:45.570]  Alright, well, I appreciate your call, sir.
[01:24:45.570 --> 01:24:49.172]  Did you have a long evening last night?
[01:24:49.172 --> 01:24:49.833]  Yes, I have.
[01:24:51.227 --> 01:24:55.288]  Yeah, because you sound drunk as a skunk, pal.
[01:24:55.288 --> 01:24:56.608]  No, I'm not drunk.
[01:24:56.608 --> 01:24:58.469]  You've had a few drinks, though.
[01:24:58.469 --> 01:24:59.789]  No.
[01:24:59.789 --> 01:25:01.750]  You did have a long evening, though.
[01:25:01.750 --> 01:25:02.410]  Yes.
[01:25:02.410 --> 01:25:06.111]  What do you like to drink normally, sir?
[01:25:06.111 --> 01:25:08.831]  I like drinking Coke or lemonade.
[01:25:08.831 --> 01:25:09.772]  No, I'm sure you do.
[01:25:09.772 --> 01:25:10.732]  I appreciate your call.
[01:25:12.405 --> 01:25:13.645]  Oh boy, I appreciate it.
[01:25:13.645 --> 01:25:16.286]  Oh man, please God help me and these people.
[01:25:16.286 --> 01:25:18.007]  I don't know how I'm supposed to get through to them.
[01:25:18.007 --> 01:25:32.330]  You know, I take the disagree calls some because I mean, I've never heard one that is actually coherent unless they're bringing up real stuff I'm wrong about, which sometimes I get facts wrong or sometimes I'm being obnoxious and somebody points it out or they have a good recommendation.
[01:25:32.330 --> 01:25:37.592]  But usually it's just all a bunch of personal issues or they misunderstand what I'm saying.
[01:25:38.892 --> 01:25:41.673]  Let's go to Christine in Texas who disagrees.
[01:25:41.673 --> 01:25:42.553]  Let's hear this one.
[01:25:42.553 --> 01:25:43.873]  Go ahead.
[01:25:43.873 --> 01:25:44.934]  Hi Alex.
[01:25:44.934 --> 01:25:49.595]  First I have to tell you that my husband is a huge fan and he's probably appalled at the moment.
[01:25:49.595 --> 01:25:51.755]  But I'm forced to listen to you every Sunday.
[01:25:51.755 --> 01:25:57.937]  And while I don't necessarily have a problem with that, I just wanted to let you know that I disagree with some of your tactics.
[01:25:58.499 --> 01:26:01.680]  Which sometimes I think clouds the message that you're trying to get across.
[01:26:01.680 --> 01:26:03.820]  Ma'am, I disagree with my tactics as well.
[01:26:03.820 --> 01:26:07.541]  I wish I was smarter and better and more suave.
[01:26:07.541 --> 01:26:12.782]  But I'm sorry, I'm just a hillbilly ragneck who doesn't like tyranny and I'm like a bull in the china shop.
[01:26:12.782 --> 01:26:17.323]  You ever heard the old British admiral who said, damn the maneuvers and go straight at them?
[01:26:17.323 --> 01:26:18.623]  You know what, that's all I can do.
[01:26:18.623 --> 01:26:21.644]  It's like, you know what, forget the maneuvers, I'm going straight at them.
[01:26:21.644 --> 01:26:26.845]  I'm simply trying to say to you that for someone like me who is a baby in terms of
[01:26:27.941 --> 01:26:30.165]  What you're trying to put forth.
[01:26:30.165 --> 01:26:34.493]  Talking about animals having their life fucked out of them might be a little over the top.
[01:26:36.778 --> 01:26:42.102]  I hear you, I hear you, but you realize there's a million dead Iraqis in the last 10 years.
[01:26:42.102 --> 01:26:44.484]  Well, last 20 since sanctions and liberation.
[01:26:44.484 --> 01:26:46.025]  I mean, what about them?
[01:26:46.025 --> 01:26:52.650]  I mean, I always see whenever we put a video out of troops shooting some little kid for fun, and they always remove the video and call it profane.
[01:26:52.650 --> 01:26:56.974]  Then they'll show simulated murder on TV like it's okay.
[01:26:56.974 --> 01:26:59.436]  They just don't want the reality being seen.
[01:27:01.537 --> 01:27:13.283]  I was pointing out that they kill dogs at the pound in a lot more brutal way than when you go put your dog down, which I love dogs and cats and have both and had to put many of them down.
[01:27:13.283 --> 01:27:19.946]  My point was is that a lot of brutal stuff goes on behind the scenes and our country is being butchered.
[01:27:19.946 --> 01:27:21.087]  But I agree with you.
[01:27:21.087 --> 01:27:24.569]  I do say a lot of abrasive, shocking stuff and I don't do it on purpose.
[01:27:24.569 --> 01:27:26.630]  It's who I am.
[01:27:26.630 --> 01:27:30.812]  But the final equation, can you argue with success, Christine?
[01:27:32.125 --> 01:27:34.331]  You are an incredibly successful person.
[01:27:34.331 --> 01:27:37.498]  It's my sincere hope that the things that you speak about
[01:27:42.435 --> 01:27:42.956]  Exactly!
[01:27:42.956 --> 01:27:51.463]  And I've got to scream bloody murder to get people to pay attention, so hopefully, you know, if I make enough of a spectacle out of this, it's going to get people's attention.
[01:27:51.463 --> 01:27:55.367]  And I never knew, because I didn't have a method to my madness, this is who I am.
[01:27:55.367 --> 01:28:00.692]  But luckily, who I am naturally, because it's not an act, actually works to get people's attention.
[01:28:00.692 --> 01:28:02.694]  And so, who God made me naturally,
[01:28:03.294 --> 01:28:07.857]  You know, guts, eyeballs, hair and all, that has actually had an effect.
[01:28:07.857 --> 01:28:08.678]  I appreciate your call.
[01:28:08.678 --> 01:28:10.299]  Let's go to one more that disagrees.
[01:28:10.299 --> 01:28:11.400]  Brian in New York.
[01:28:11.400 --> 01:28:12.981]  Go ahead, Brian.
[01:28:12.981 --> 01:28:14.082]  Hey there, Alex.
[01:28:14.082 --> 01:28:15.083]  Hey, buddy.
[01:28:15.083 --> 01:28:16.964]  I'm outraged.
[01:28:16.964 --> 01:28:17.965]  Okay, go ahead.
[01:28:17.965 --> 01:28:18.825]  Okay.
[01:28:18.825 --> 01:28:21.948]  You've been working out on the treadmill.
[01:28:21.948 --> 01:28:23.589]  Hey, do me a favor and turn the radio down.
[01:28:23.589 --> 01:28:26.131]  Okay.
[01:28:26.131 --> 01:28:28.812]  Well, I also jog on the street, so I'm going to go ahead.
[01:28:28.812 --> 01:28:29.353]  There we go.
[01:28:29.353 --> 01:28:31.835]  I also run upstairs, but go ahead.
[01:28:31.835 --> 01:28:32.135]  I hear you.
[01:28:33.089 --> 01:28:39.855]  So, are you telling me that you ran on the road 10 miles and threw up on the road or threw up in a bucket on the side of the treadmill?
[01:28:39.855 --> 01:28:43.678]  No, I ran on the road and I actually ran upstairs and a treadmill today.
[01:28:43.678 --> 01:28:45.580]  If you want to total it all up.
[01:28:45.580 --> 01:28:47.962]  But, uh, I don't know how that's disagreeing.
[01:28:47.962 --> 01:28:50.524]  Point is, I've lost 30 plus pounds.
[01:28:50.524 --> 01:28:52.746]  So it's not about how I ran the miles.
[01:28:52.746 --> 01:28:54.187]  I'm losing the pounds.
[01:28:54.187 --> 01:28:55.388]  That's what matters.
[01:28:55.388 --> 01:28:57.510]  You see, personal disagreement.
[01:28:57.510 --> 01:28:58.511]  Not the point of the show.
[01:29:01.581 --> 01:29:17.050]  You've heard Alex explain how the Silver Lungs Generator infuses the respiratory system with your self-produced colloidal silver solutions, yet many are unaware of the entire function of the Silver Lungs System and how it has been designed to deliver your silver solutions anywhere in or on the body.
[01:29:17.050 --> 01:29:20.732]  My name is Mario Cifaldi and I'm the developer of the Silver Lungs Generator.
[01:29:21.741 --> 01:29:34.513]  Not only does the Silver Lung System produce endless colloidal and ionic silver solutions, it also comes equipped with the proper applicators and devices needed to deliver your silver solutions directly to key target areas.
[01:29:34.513 --> 01:29:41.780]  This includes the eyes, ears, nose, lungs, topically to the skin, and orally for the digestive system.
[01:29:42.461 --> 01:29:52.830]  Be sure to watch our new 7-minute video tour of the Silver Lungs System at www.SilverLungs.com to learn more about how the Silver Lungs System works.

[01:30:00.600 --> 01:30:04.745]  Did you ever think you'd be where you are, a decade into the 21st century?
[01:30:04.745 --> 01:30:08.889]  Record foreclosure rates for homes, if not yours, your neighbors.
[01:30:08.889 --> 01:30:11.852]  Thankful for the unemployment checks since you were laid off.
[01:30:11.852 --> 01:30:18.340]  And placing your child's name on the angel tree in hopes of a Christmas gift, along with thousands of other Americans.
[01:30:18.840 --> 01:30:22.082]  Did you ever think your future would feel this out of control?
[01:30:22.082 --> 01:30:27.286]  The fact is, in all this craziness, there's only one thing you can control.
[01:30:27.286 --> 01:30:28.807]  Your greatest dependency.
[01:30:28.807 --> 01:30:30.248]  Your food supply.
[01:30:30.248 --> 01:30:34.431]  Make 2012 the year you take control by getting prepared.

[01:31:58.041 --> 01:31:58.902]  Others don't.
[01:32:00.482 --> 01:32:04.343]  You may be arrested and or subject to other police action.
[01:32:04.343 --> 01:32:05.624]  Tyranny is here.
[01:32:05.624 --> 01:32:09.265]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[01:32:09.265 --> 01:32:11.766]  It really says that the state is God.
[01:32:11.766 --> 01:32:17.648]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on Earth.
[01:32:17.648 --> 01:32:23.890]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps now being expanded nationwide.
[01:32:24.310 --> 01:32:30.295]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful shadow state.
[01:32:30.295 --> 01:32:34.458]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depth to which our republic has fallen.
[01:32:34.458 --> 01:32:38.762]  Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship.
[01:32:38.762 --> 01:32:44.707]  Body scanners, sound cannons, citizen spies, stage terror, and cameras on every street corner.
[01:32:44.707 --> 01:32:48.270]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[01:32:48.270 --> 01:32:50.231]  The police state isn't coming.
[01:32:50.231 --> 01:32:50.672]  It's here.

[01:33:27.754 --> 01:33:37.322]  Alright, now I gotta start getting into the news right now, but don't worry, I'll get to Zach, James, Robert, and Susan before this show ends, if the water doesn't rise over Bear Creek.
[01:33:37.322 --> 01:33:50.952]  I covered some of the news in the opening segment, but you notice I opened the phones up to the entire globe, and we have three million listeners a day on the weekday show.
[01:33:50.952 --> 01:33:53.915]  The Sunday show is more of a hobby, only about a million and a half.
[01:33:55.511 --> 01:34:02.557]  A million plus listeners out there, and that's live, not counting internet and podcasts and stuff later.
[01:34:02.557 --> 01:34:04.879]  About 700,000 a day download the podcast.
[01:34:05.808 --> 01:34:09.630]  And no one calls in a disagree who can really make a salient point.
[01:34:09.630 --> 01:34:13.533]  I mean, the lady made one about me pointing out how they really kill dogs at the pound.
[01:34:13.533 --> 01:34:17.915]  I meant that to go get the dogs out of the pound, or spay and neuter your animals.
[01:34:17.915 --> 01:34:19.616]  I didn't mean that to be mean.
[01:34:19.616 --> 01:34:20.677]  You know what?
[01:34:20.677 --> 01:34:27.380]  That stuff's going on at the pound, at the dog shelter, whether I talk about it or not.
[01:34:27.380 --> 01:34:31.943]  There's this idea that I talk about something, and then it makes it become real.
[01:34:31.943 --> 01:34:33.424]  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[01:34:34.602 --> 01:34:38.165]  People think that if they believe something, that makes it real.
[01:34:38.165 --> 01:34:45.670]  But if they say it isn't true, I've had people look at me and say, I choose not to believe that.
[01:34:45.670 --> 01:34:46.691]  I was deer hunting.
[01:34:46.691 --> 01:34:47.572]  Well, I wasn't deer hunting.
[01:34:47.572 --> 01:34:55.218]  I was at our family's ranch and they had some deer hunters there who were leasing part of the property back on opening day.
[01:34:55.218 --> 01:34:57.520]  And we were having a cookout barbecue down there.
[01:34:58.690 --> 01:35:05.933]  And a couple of them came over, veterans, engineers, with an engineering company that had leased a part of the ranch.
[01:35:05.933 --> 01:35:08.073]  They had leased like a thousand acres of it.
[01:35:08.073 --> 01:35:12.655]  And they came over to me, my family's got a big ranch in East Texas, goes back to Spanish Land Grant.
[01:35:12.655 --> 01:35:14.356]  People are like, part of it was a thousand acres?
[01:35:14.356 --> 01:35:15.596]  Yeah, it's big.
[01:35:15.596 --> 01:35:23.839]  And they came over, and were like, I've seen you on TV, you're Alex Jones!
[01:35:23.839 --> 01:35:25.860]  You think 9-11's an inside job?
[01:35:27.441 --> 01:35:28.862]  And I'm like, you know what?
[01:35:28.862 --> 01:35:30.383]  I don't want to get into it right now.
[01:35:30.383 --> 01:35:31.044]  I don't want to argue.
[01:35:31.044 --> 01:35:33.106]  No, let's argue.
[01:35:33.106 --> 01:35:35.227]  Here, have some Crown Royal.
[01:35:35.227 --> 01:35:39.090]  And I'm sitting there talking to the guy, and I go, okay, well here's my iPhone.
[01:35:39.090 --> 01:35:40.371]  It's got Cell.
[01:35:40.371 --> 01:35:47.137]  Let me pull up Amaral, Lockheed, Fox News, number three in Al-Qaeda, meeting secretly with the Pentagon.
[01:35:47.137 --> 01:35:49.679]  Or let me pull up the Libyan rebels being Al-Qaeda.
[01:35:49.679 --> 01:35:54.663]  So I start showing it to him, and after about 20 minutes he goes, Alex, do you believe in God?
[01:35:54.663 --> 01:35:55.964]  And I said, yeah.
[01:35:57.017 --> 01:35:59.538]  And he said, do you believe in faith?
[01:35:59.538 --> 01:36:02.080]  Because some stuff in the Bible's been disproven.
[01:36:02.080 --> 01:36:04.561]  But still I believe in Jesus.
[01:36:04.561 --> 01:36:06.682]  So I'm not going to look at your facts.
[01:36:06.682 --> 01:36:09.543]  I choose to believe that isn't true.
[01:36:09.543 --> 01:36:13.265]  And I said, well, who are you to say the Bible's even been disproven?
[01:36:13.265 --> 01:36:22.589]  I mean, he's saying this is an article of faith for me, and I am saying I'm not going to look at this evidence.
[01:36:22.589 --> 01:36:25.191]  And I was giving him one one millionth of it, literally.
[01:36:26.175 --> 01:36:40.043]  That's like, oh, you just want to engage me and you want to have a debate with me about something, but you don't actually want to have the debate.
[01:36:40.043 --> 01:36:42.444]  As soon as you realize, I've got my facts.
[01:36:42.444 --> 01:36:43.665]  I know what I'm talking about.
[01:36:44.875 --> 01:36:46.396]  You don't want to hear it.
[01:36:46.396 --> 01:36:49.577]  And no, America didn't stage 9-11.
[01:36:49.577 --> 01:36:54.920]  No, your cousin who's a Marine Corps sergeant didn't stage it.
[01:36:54.920 --> 01:37:05.305]  Criminal, globalist infiltrators that fund the radical Muslims on record staged the attacks, opened the door, ran the whole deal.
[01:37:05.305 --> 01:37:07.326]  I've proven it up one side and down the other.
[01:37:07.326 --> 01:37:09.267]  I've interviewed the heads of the U.S.
[01:37:09.267 --> 01:37:10.728]  Embassy who were told,
[01:37:12.389 --> 01:37:16.032]  You know, let Mohammed Adda, let them all back into the U.S.
[01:37:16.032 --> 01:37:16.853]  They're really U.S.
[01:37:16.853 --> 01:37:18.875]  government agents.
[01:37:18.875 --> 01:37:20.876]  I've interviewed the lawyer who saw the U.S.
[01:37:20.876 --> 01:37:24.199]  government getting the underwear bomber on the plane two Christmases ago.
[01:37:24.199 --> 01:37:26.962]  He's been on this show.
[01:37:26.962 --> 01:37:27.942]  And months later, the U.S.
[01:37:27.942 --> 01:37:32.286]  government and Congress admitted, we were ordered to help get him on the plane by an unnamed U.S.
[01:37:32.286 --> 01:37:33.988]  agency, the State Department said.
[01:37:33.988 --> 01:37:36.470]  Those are facts that don't change.
[01:37:36.470 --> 01:37:38.752]  Not one, but two passports.
[01:37:40.998 --> 01:37:55.564]  From those aircraft that hit those buildings on 9-11, went through their suits, through the fireball, through the millions of papers, through the feet of dust and fire, and were found that day by the FBI!
[01:37:55.564 --> 01:37:58.345]  That's a total setup!
[01:37:58.345 --> 01:38:07.909]  They might as well found a Lucky Charms leprechaun down there's find the two passports, undamaged in the rubble.
[01:38:07.909 --> 01:38:08.909]  It's a frame-up!
[01:38:10.236 --> 01:38:21.083]  Mohammed Adda's bag didn't go through the checkout properly and was found with all the admissions and the flight uniforms and the maps and the confessions.
[01:38:21.083 --> 01:38:22.765]  They found... I mean, come on, man!
[01:38:22.765 --> 01:38:27.728]  You ever heard of a frame-up?
[01:38:27.728 --> 01:38:30.610]  You ever heard of a... and you're like, well, why would they do that?
[01:38:30.610 --> 01:38:31.691]  Let me play you a clip here.
[01:38:33.772 --> 01:38:41.155]  I know I told you guys have the Daily Show ready first, then making fun of the police state and secret arrest, but give me Santorum first.
[01:38:41.155 --> 01:38:53.080]  Pull former Senator Rick Santorum up, where he says, we'll kill anybody we want without warrants, without law, without anything, anytime.
[01:38:53.080 --> 01:38:54.481]  He goes, we're killing U.S.
[01:38:54.481 --> 01:38:55.161]  citizens.
[01:38:55.161 --> 01:39:01.824]  Alocki, the guy who's admitted to CIA and who I predicted you'd have a staged killing of once you took him out of circulation?
[01:39:02.895 --> 01:39:05.796]  This is the guy who hangs out at the Pentagon secretly.
[01:39:05.796 --> 01:39:07.237]  The head of the 7-7 bombing.
[01:39:07.237 --> 01:39:11.139]  It came out in the London Telegraph, BBC and Fox News was MI6.
[01:39:11.139 --> 01:39:13.980]  I mean, I'm not the one making this stuff up.
[01:39:13.980 --> 01:39:17.382]  I wish it was a bunch of crazy Muslims in caves doing it.
[01:39:17.382 --> 01:39:24.485]  This is a lot less scarier than Uncle Sam being a crazy-eyed murdering terrorist.
[01:39:24.485 --> 01:39:27.486]  But Uncle Sam works for the foreign banks now.
[01:39:27.486 --> 01:39:30.888]  Same folks stealing Grandma's pension fund.
[01:39:30.888 --> 01:39:31.148]  Okay?
[01:39:33.390 --> 01:39:40.757]  Listen, I wish every day it'd be so much fun to just be scared of cavemen in Afghanistan.
[01:39:40.757 --> 01:39:42.679]  But it's not true.
[01:39:42.679 --> 01:39:44.460]  So I can't do it.
[01:39:44.460 --> 01:39:46.602]  I can't be a liar.
[01:39:46.602 --> 01:39:47.863]  I can't be a sellout.
[01:39:47.863 --> 01:39:49.485]  I can't do it.
[01:39:49.485 --> 01:39:52.648]  I have to live in the real world.
[01:39:52.648 --> 01:39:55.971]  Now here's Santorum giving a speech just two days ago.
[01:39:55.971 --> 01:39:59.074]  He's real proud of himself about killing citizens.
[01:40:01.828 --> 01:40:09.393]  Now they're in the process of developing nuclear weapons and it appears obvious to me that the administration is doing little to nothing.
[01:40:09.393 --> 01:40:25.102]  Now I'm hopeful that some of the things we're seeing with respect to the nuclear program that the United States is involved with, which is on occasion scientists working on the nuclear program in Iran turn up dead.
[01:40:25.102 --> 01:40:26.203]  I think that's a wonderful thing.
[01:40:30.643 --> 01:40:30.783]  Okay.
[01:40:30.783 --> 01:40:33.684]  Yeah, but Israel has hundreds of nuclear weapons.
[01:40:33.684 --> 01:40:34.224]  Now, again,
[01:41:01.348 --> 01:41:05.332]  You hear all the weak men in that room who think killing is tough.
[01:41:05.332 --> 01:41:06.373]  They never killed anybody.
[01:41:06.373 --> 01:41:11.917]  In fact, their problem is they didn't grow up in a rough part of town and get beat up every day.
[01:41:11.917 --> 01:41:14.780]  They think violence is tough.
[01:41:14.780 --> 01:41:17.362]  They think it's cute.
[01:41:17.362 --> 01:41:19.604]  They think it's sexy.
[01:41:19.604 --> 01:41:20.805]  They're all giggling.
[01:41:20.805 --> 01:41:24.689]  What happens when Iran starts killing
[01:41:28.012 --> 01:41:28.332]  U.S.
[01:41:28.332 --> 01:41:31.973]  government people, oh, it's going to be the end of the world, how dare them?
[01:41:31.973 --> 01:41:34.413]  And Iran has now said they're going to respond to the U.S.
[01:41:34.413 --> 01:41:37.154]  and Israel by trying to kill people.
[01:41:37.154 --> 01:41:40.895]  Which will then start a huge war that will bring Russia and China in, probably.
[01:41:40.895 --> 01:41:42.615]  And we're off to the races.
[01:41:42.615 --> 01:41:52.537]  You know, he just sits up there and says, oh, when people, you know, whole military bases are getting bombs dropped on them, police stations are being blown up, people are being shot and killed and bombed.
[01:41:54.426 --> 01:41:55.386]  He likes that.
[01:41:55.386 --> 01:41:57.387]  He thinks that's a good thing.
[01:41:57.387 --> 01:42:11.509]  Some little soft chicken hawk nobody picking on a country of 76 million people that haven't been under 20 years of sanctions like the Iraqis and who are going to fight back.
[01:42:11.509 --> 01:42:18.110]  But notice when they were first trying to pass the National Defense Authorization Act last year that Obama signed December 31st, 2011.
[01:42:22.458 --> 01:42:24.599]  And they said, don't worry, it doesn't affect citizens.
[01:42:24.599 --> 01:42:29.420]  And the ACLU, myself, Ron Paul, others said, well, it says right here it affects US citizens.
[01:42:29.420 --> 01:42:30.761]  Secret arrest, we can disappear.
[01:42:30.761 --> 01:42:34.742]  And they said, no, it doesn't.
[01:42:34.742 --> 01:42:37.343]  Soon as they passed it, though, they said, you bet it does.
[01:42:37.343 --> 01:42:46.866]  And they had all these creepy senators sweating and hopping around like they were on methamphetamine, say on C-SPAN, you bet it's for citizens.
[01:42:46.866 --> 01:42:47.826]  You better be scared.
[01:42:47.826 --> 01:42:49.387]  I want you to be scared!
[01:42:50.421 --> 01:42:51.441]  Because these aren't Americas.
[01:42:51.441 --> 01:42:56.964]  These are... These are errand boys for the foreign banks sucking this country dry, and they fund Al-Qaeda to begin with.
[01:42:56.964 --> 01:43:03.607]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones.
[01:43:03.607 --> 01:43:08.910]  I'm looking for people that have the wisdom to spot savings, opportunity, and recognize risk.
[01:43:08.910 --> 01:43:10.451]  Saving means to make money.

[01:43:27.498 --> 01:43:35.502]  Your risk is the hundreds of hazardous toxic detergents that give you rashes, itching sores, and deteriorating clothing called lint.
[01:43:35.502 --> 01:43:40.744]  If you want something better, if you want something you've never had before, you have to do something you've never done before.

[01:44:08.837 --> 01:44:11.800]  Thankful for the unemployment checks since you were laid off.
[01:44:11.800 --> 01:44:18.289]  And placing your child's name on the angel tree in hopes of a Christmas gift, along with thousands of other Americans.
[01:44:18.789 --> 01:44:22.032]  Did you ever think your future would feel this out of control?
[01:44:22.032 --> 01:44:27.236]  The fact is, in all this craziness, there's only one thing you can control.
[01:44:27.236 --> 01:44:28.757]  Your greatest dependency.
[01:44:28.757 --> 01:44:30.178]  Your food supply.
[01:44:30.178 --> 01:44:34.381]  Make 2012 the year you take control by getting prepared.
[01:44:34.381 --> 01:44:39.786]  eFoods Direct introduces the best way to build your food supply in the 21st century.

[01:45:00.131 --> 01:45:04.674]  This is Alex Jones with 5 good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[01:45:04.674 --> 01:45:05.594]  Number 1.
[01:45:05.594 --> 01:45:09.017]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[01:45:09.017 --> 01:45:09.877]  Number 2.
[01:45:09.877 --> 01:45:14.760]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[01:45:14.760 --> 01:45:15.501]  It's true.
[01:45:15.501 --> 01:45:20.384]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[01:45:20.384 --> 01:45:21.204]  Number 3.
[01:45:21.204 --> 01:45:24.787]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[01:45:24.787 --> 01:45:28.489]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[01:45:28.689 --> 01:45:29.490]  Number 4.
[01:45:29.490 --> 01:45:32.253]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[01:45:32.253 --> 01:45:35.937]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[01:45:35.937 --> 01:45:36.718]  Number 5.
[01:45:36.718 --> 01:45:40.883]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[01:45:40.883 --> 01:45:45.648]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[01:45:45.908 --> 01:45:50.090]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.

[01:46:01.874 --> 01:46:05.835]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about the Silver Lungs Generator.
[01:46:05.835 --> 01:46:14.698]  Now you can produce pure and endless colloidal silver and deliver the solution directly into the bloodstream by breathing the solution through the lungs.
[01:46:14.698 --> 01:46:19.319]  The respiratory system is the first line of defense for airborne pathogens and viruses.
[01:46:19.319 --> 01:46:30.143]  The Silver Lungs Generator infuses the respiratory system with your self-produced nano-silver solutions and also delivers the silver nanoparticles instantly into the bloodstream.
[01:46:30.763 --> 01:46:40.285]  With continued legislation threatening the sale of nano silver products, you can now produce pure and endless loyal silver with the Silver Lungs Generator.

[01:47:01.658 --> 01:47:03.179]  Coast to coast.
[01:47:03.179 --> 01:47:05.240]  Direct from Austin.
[01:47:05.240 --> 01:47:14.344]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network.
[01:47:14.344 --> 01:47:15.345]  Big Brother.
[01:47:15.345 --> 01:47:17.005]  Mainstream media.
[01:47:17.005 --> 01:47:18.406]  Government cover-ups.
[01:47:18.406 --> 01:47:19.687]  You want answers?
[01:47:19.687 --> 01:47:21.708]  Well, so does he.
[01:47:21.708 --> 01:47:25.309]  It's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:47:33.331 --> 01:47:38.976]  Well, I'm looking at dozens of phone calls on the board from Ace in Texas to Zack in Texas.
[01:47:38.976 --> 01:47:44.280]  From Wyatt in Illinois to Cody in PA.
[01:47:44.280 --> 01:47:46.522]  I've got to expand this Sunday Show to three hours.
[01:47:46.522 --> 01:47:51.025]  Why do I even come in here and do two hours and not do a third hour?
[01:47:51.025 --> 01:47:57.190]  Yeah, I haven't even gotten to the Stephen Colbert running joke videos.
[01:47:57.190 --> 01:48:01.714]  Making fun of Mitt Romney, but making it a joke.
[01:48:05.350 --> 01:48:08.473]  You know what, I'll give each caller about 30 seconds so I can get to everybody.
[01:48:08.473 --> 01:48:22.287]  I'm gonna do that, but I want to, I want to right now go ahead and pull up that Jon Stewart show clip where he makes the joke out of secret arrest and imprisonment of U.S.
[01:48:22.287 --> 01:48:23.568]  citizens.
[01:48:23.568 --> 01:48:29.054]  And then I've been sent the secret Homeland Security documents where it's not about Al Qaeda, it's about us!
[01:48:30.520 --> 01:48:32.622]  I mean, this is so creepy.
[01:48:32.622 --> 01:48:34.443]  Crooks took over the government.
[01:48:34.443 --> 01:48:36.004]  Obama's just their pimp.
[01:48:36.004 --> 01:48:37.265]  So was Bush.
[01:48:37.265 --> 01:48:38.846]  They're raping the nation.
[01:48:38.846 --> 01:48:42.549]  They're getting trillions of dollars a month in banker bailouts.
[01:48:42.549 --> 01:48:46.071]  And they think martial law will keep us in political line.
[01:48:46.071 --> 01:48:53.877]  Here's a clip of them making a joke about this after it's law on Comedy Central.
[01:48:53.877 --> 01:48:55.178]  Barack Obama.
[01:48:55.178 --> 01:48:56.359]  Ah, Barack Obama.
[01:48:56.359 --> 01:48:56.919]  Ooh.
[01:48:59.738 --> 01:49:03.781]  The socialist, Muslim, Kenyan, Christian.
[01:49:03.781 --> 01:49:11.228]  I wonder what permanent damage he's done to our country from his laboratory of power-grabbing that he inhabits between the small window between Christmas and New Year's.
[01:49:11.228 --> 01:49:13.189]  He's so dangerous.
[01:49:13.189 --> 01:49:20.375]  In his last official act of the year, the vacationing President Obama signed the $662 billion military spending bill in Hawaii.
[01:49:20.375 --> 01:49:27.842]  That allows the military to indefinitely detain terror suspects, including American citizens in the U.S.
[01:49:35.082 --> 01:49:37.183]  I was kidding about the damage.
[01:49:37.183 --> 01:49:47.647]  I was ironically portraying a character who believes the president is exercising executive power in an unwarranted fashion, creating humor through the juxtaposition of
[01:49:49.281 --> 01:49:50.201]  It's not funny, Stewart.
[01:49:50.201 --> 01:49:58.463]  The last thing the president did in 2011 was sign a bill that pretty much does away with due process for anyone suspected of terrorism in America?
[01:49:58.463 --> 01:50:00.803]  No wonder he signed it on New Year's Eve.
[01:50:00.803 --> 01:50:05.984]  The one night the media's most tenacious reporter, Mr. Keeping Them Honest, would be completely distracted.
[01:50:05.984 --> 01:50:12.685]  There was some comedian half-naked.
[01:50:12.685 --> 01:50:15.666]  Anderson Cooper couldn't keep the president honest.
[01:50:15.666 --> 01:50:17.406]  He couldn't even keep Kathy Griffin's shirt on.
[01:50:18.274 --> 01:50:20.695]  CIA, look it up.
[01:50:20.695 --> 01:50:22.375]  Still a big joke.
[01:50:22.375 --> 01:50:28.956]  Still, I cannot believe Barack Obama signed that provision.
[01:50:28.956 --> 01:50:30.656]  The President signed it reluctantly.
[01:50:30.656 --> 01:50:31.337]  Oh.
[01:50:31.337 --> 01:50:35.998]  Well now, I didn't realize that.
[01:50:35.998 --> 01:50:42.639]  I didn't know that, as long as he signed the bill allowing for Americans indefinite detention while sighing.
[01:50:44.588 --> 01:50:48.170]  Perhaps he included an appropriate emoticon with his signature.
[01:50:48.170 --> 01:50:49.791]  Folks, this isn't going to be funny soon.
[01:50:49.791 --> 01:50:51.512]  This is all about taking your pension funds.
[01:50:51.512 --> 01:50:52.553]  Get ready.
[01:50:52.553 --> 01:50:53.433]  Get ready, folks.
[01:50:53.433 --> 01:50:57.236]  I'm sorry, I don't want you to not have a lawyer, but... Get ready, folks.
[01:50:57.236 --> 01:50:58.356]  They're doing this for a reason.
[01:50:58.356 --> 01:51:12.325]  Actually, when signing the bill, the president issued a signing statement, a presidential expression of objection or interpretation, which said in part, although this bill authorizes the government to detain Americans indefinitely, well, I'll let him finish.
[01:51:13.208 --> 01:51:18.552]  My administration will not authorize the indefinite military detention without trial of American citizens.
[01:51:18.552 --> 01:51:21.114]  Whew!
[01:51:21.114 --> 01:51:21.775]  See?
[01:51:21.775 --> 01:51:24.877]  Presidents can, but he won't.
[01:51:24.877 --> 01:51:29.401]  Which is great, since he'll always be president.
[01:51:29.401 --> 01:51:30.602]  Since he lies.
[01:51:30.602 --> 01:51:32.663]  He said he would veto the bill.
[01:51:32.663 --> 01:51:33.424]  I know that voice.
[01:51:33.424 --> 01:51:35.966]  It's me!
[01:51:35.966 --> 01:51:37.467]  Gitmo!
[01:51:37.467 --> 01:51:39.068]  Gitmo Elmo.
[01:51:39.068 --> 01:51:41.170]  Oh my God, Gitmo, what are you doing here?
[01:51:42.867 --> 01:51:45.169]  Oh, it's real funny, isn't it?
[01:51:45.169 --> 01:51:46.170]  Alright, that's enough.
[01:51:46.170 --> 01:51:46.690]  That's enough.
[01:51:46.690 --> 01:51:47.911]  It goes on and on.
[01:51:47.911 --> 01:51:53.015]  All things up at Infowars.com.
[01:51:53.015 --> 01:51:56.958]  Obama said he was going to veto that bill so we couldn't form opposition against it.
[01:51:56.958 --> 01:51:59.780]  I told you that three weeks before he signed it.
[01:51:59.780 --> 01:52:01.181]  I told you it affected citizens.
[01:52:01.181 --> 01:52:02.522]  They said it didn't.
[01:52:02.522 --> 01:52:07.686]  These are all tactics to make sure you never wake up and get involved.
[01:52:07.686 --> 01:52:09.587]  And I've got a whole stack of news here.
[01:52:09.587 --> 01:52:11.229]  I see these type of news articles every day.
[01:52:12.096 --> 01:52:13.877]  This is out of the Montreal Gazette.
[01:52:13.877 --> 01:52:16.198]  Radioactive iodine in rainwater.
[01:52:16.198 --> 01:52:17.659]  This is new radioactive iodine.
[01:52:17.659 --> 01:52:19.660]  Only lasts eight days.
[01:52:19.660 --> 01:52:21.061]  This type.
[01:52:21.061 --> 01:52:23.302]  Very carcinogenic, though.
[01:52:23.302 --> 01:52:25.283]  Because Fukushima's still melting down.
[01:52:25.283 --> 01:52:27.544]  That's in the Canadian papers.
[01:52:27.544 --> 01:52:30.506]  And it basically goes on to say the government has covered that up.
[01:52:30.506 --> 01:52:32.266]  So has our government.
[01:52:32.266 --> 01:52:33.207]  Used to, they didn't, though.
[01:52:35.570 --> 01:52:36.230]  Here's another one.
[01:52:36.230 --> 01:52:39.512]  Prosecutor says captain left ship early.
[01:52:39.512 --> 01:52:41.453]  This is out of USA Today.
[01:52:41.453 --> 01:52:49.757]  Yeah, instead of just actually helping the folks, it took about 10 hours for the ship finally sunk partially.
[01:52:49.757 --> 01:52:53.779]  The main crew and the captain just evacuated themselves first.
[01:52:53.779 --> 01:52:55.860]  Captains never really acted like that previously.
[01:52:55.860 --> 01:52:58.901]  The captain of the Titanic went down with it.
[01:52:58.901 --> 01:53:02.083]  But I mean, nowadays they just, you know, so what?
[01:53:03.228 --> 01:53:07.269]  Again, it's a society where nobody cares anymore.
[01:53:07.269 --> 01:53:10.990]  Don't worry though, universal flu vaccine could be available in 2013.
[01:53:10.990 --> 01:53:17.972]  Never mind the fact these companies have been given liability protection, so show what how many people they kill or maim.
[01:53:17.972 --> 01:53:18.832]  Here's another one.
[01:53:18.832 --> 01:53:22.153]  The link between processed meat and cancer.
[01:53:22.153 --> 01:53:25.534]  The British Journal of Cancer reports that all of those
[01:53:26.414 --> 01:53:31.995]  Things that keep the meat from rotting actually rots your pancreas and your colon and it's giving you cancer.
[01:53:31.995 --> 01:53:35.196]  Turns out you should eat fresh meat, not processed meat.
[01:53:35.196 --> 01:53:41.377]  And it could be that virus for a decade they've been spraying on meat that eats bacteria is also causing cancer.
[01:53:41.377 --> 01:53:45.218]  Oh yeah, they spray a live vaccine on most of your cold cuts.
[01:53:45.218 --> 01:53:47.698]  And that's a British Journal of Cancer.
[01:53:47.698 --> 01:53:48.399]  So what though?
[01:53:48.399 --> 01:53:52.720]  Hey, who doesn't like a case of colon cancer or pancreas cancer?
[01:53:52.720 --> 01:53:53.560]  I mean, don't listen to me.
[01:53:53.560 --> 01:53:54.640]  I'm a conspiracy theorist.
[01:53:55.526 --> 01:53:56.926]  Uh, that's just some of the news here.
[01:53:56.926 --> 01:53:59.327]  We've got about six minutes left in transmission.
[01:53:59.327 --> 01:54:00.607]  I'm gonna, this is what I'm gonna do.
[01:54:00.607 --> 01:54:03.368]  I'm going to you when you hear the... or whatever.
[01:54:03.368 --> 01:54:04.569]  Does our phone system make a noise?
[01:54:04.569 --> 01:54:06.629]  I know the weekday phone system does.
[01:54:06.629 --> 01:54:08.350]  This one's different.
[01:54:08.350 --> 01:54:11.551]  Okay, well I'll just say you're on the air.
[01:54:11.551 --> 01:54:12.311]  I want to hear from you.
[01:54:12.311 --> 01:54:13.991]  I wish I had ten hours.
[01:54:13.991 --> 01:54:16.532]  But I... and just make your point and go to the next person.
[01:54:16.532 --> 01:54:19.733]  Zack in Texas, you're on the air.
[01:54:19.733 --> 01:54:22.654]  Hey Alex, I got two things for you.
[01:54:22.654 --> 01:54:22.954]  Yes sir.
[01:54:23.707 --> 01:54:30.748]  Um, one of them, I got an update for you from the Strawpoll local activist group, got something funny from uh, Breitbart.
[01:54:30.748 --> 01:54:48.452]  Uh, the other one is that uh, I'm running for Ron Paul's seat as a Libertarian down here, and I went to the Republicanoid, uh, kind of neo-condo, handed out my information yesterday, and did a real good reaction, but the people who are running for his seat are big time, uh, state government guys from the good ol' boy system.
[01:54:49.798 --> 01:54:51.199]  Well, give me some info on that.
[01:54:51.199 --> 01:54:53.580]  That sounds interesting, Zach.
[01:54:53.580 --> 01:54:56.182]  What was your point about Breitbart?
[01:54:56.182 --> 01:54:58.823]  Well, yeah, if anyone can, go to Grady for Congress.
[01:54:58.823 --> 01:55:08.808]  But anyways, Breitbart, the Houston Prefingers put a camera in his face and they did a legit interview with him and he was all kind of paranoid about if it was independent media and it was.
[01:55:08.808 --> 01:55:14.771]  And they were asking him questions and they let him spew the party line and all this stuff and he talked about Occupy.
[01:55:14.771 --> 01:55:18.753]  Well, then when they got down to it, the guy asking a question said, well, what do you think about
[01:55:19.423 --> 01:55:29.107]  The NDAA bill and immediately his face changed, like, the look on it and he got all mad looking and he said to Derek, he's like, uh, is this a Ron Paul interview?
[01:55:29.107 --> 01:55:36.411]  And then he's like, I gotta go to L.A., I gotta find- I hear ya, but hey, at least Drudge, who, you know, is the granddaddy of all that, he covers NDAA.
[01:55:36.411 --> 01:55:42.734]  I mean, you know, the headline, Obama signs NDAA for indefinite detention, but won't use it against Americans.
[01:55:42.734 --> 01:55:45.115]  You know, if Drudge helped get that out, who knows what's going on there.
[01:55:46.239 --> 01:55:48.180]  Let's go ahead and talk to James in Ohio.
[01:55:48.180 --> 01:55:48.941]  James, you're on the air.
[01:55:48.941 --> 01:55:50.822]  Yeah, tell me some.
[01:56:10.954 --> 01:56:22.497]  There's eKaiga, which is a soft phone, and the eKaiga.net does the, they have a server where you can use that to make calls to all your other eKaiga friends.
[01:56:22.497 --> 01:56:23.198]  Good.
[01:56:23.198 --> 01:56:27.639]  And there's also an open source program, it's Asterisk.
[01:56:27.639 --> 01:56:31.660]  It's a server, and it allows you to make, you know, text, voice, and video chats.
[01:56:33.428 --> 01:56:43.044]  For those who just joined us, Microsoft has bought Skype and is planning on ruining it like they do everything else they touch.
[01:56:43.044 --> 01:56:44.387]  So we're having a look at alternatives, Jim.
[01:56:45.123 --> 01:56:46.384]  Well, they probably spy on you.
[01:57:04.989 --> 01:57:06.130]  Oh wow, 30 seconds.
[01:57:06.130 --> 01:57:08.653]  Real quick Alex, this is a soft disagreement.
[01:57:08.653 --> 01:57:18.283]  I'm a long time listener, three years, and you've been making a thematic statement about America's gone or dead because America's an idea and I totally disagree with you.
[01:57:18.283 --> 01:57:19.705]  I mean, totally agree with you.
[01:57:19.705 --> 01:57:24.570]  The point, the part I disagree or the point I'd like to issue is that you're basically a 2012 skeptic.
[01:57:26.238 --> 01:57:32.241]  And basically, I just want to point out one thing, and my name actually is Ace Onslaught, that's my username.
[01:57:32.241 --> 01:57:34.622]  Now, real quick, two points.
[01:57:34.622 --> 01:57:37.363]  What I'm saying is America, as we know it, is dead.
[01:57:37.363 --> 01:57:38.824]  We can revive it.
[01:57:38.824 --> 01:57:41.325]  But it's dead, so admit it's dead so we can get it back.
[01:57:41.325 --> 01:57:42.486]  I'm out of time.
[01:57:42.486 --> 01:57:47.128]  I'm out of time, but I'm saying admit we've been conquered by the globalists through fraud and ignorance.
[01:57:47.128 --> 01:57:49.529]  Time to wake up, kick the banksters out.
