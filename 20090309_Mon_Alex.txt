[00:14.320 --> 00:43.320]  on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones
[00:43.320 --> 00:48.800]  welcome ladies and gentlemen welcome and thank you so much for joining us today
[00:48.800 --> 00:58.440]  we're going to be live here for the next four hours have a lot of extremely important news
[00:58.440 --> 01:06.000]  it is the ninth day of March 2009 we're going to be live here again as I said for the next four
[01:06.000 --> 01:19.200]  hours coming up in the third hour today I'm going to do a detailed review of the blockbuster film
[01:19.200 --> 01:29.720]  that was released nationwide on Friday the Watchman we'll go over the characters night owl the
[01:29.720 --> 01:44.000]  comedian Rorschach Dr. Manhattan silk specter Ozzy mandamus I have never seen such a luminati in
[01:44.000 --> 01:53.920]  your face propaganda it was off the charts and yes spoiler alert I am going to you know lay out
[01:53.920 --> 02:02.400]  what the film covers in detail including the ending it's hard to even mention it right now and then
[02:02.400 --> 02:14.280]  not get into it it's just unspeakable unspeakable and if I would have known how new world order
[02:14.280 --> 02:21.200]  was going to be because I've never really been into comic books a lot of people over the years
[02:21.200 --> 02:27.920]  it sent me Watchman comic books and said you got to read this you got to look at this you know the
[02:27.920 --> 02:35.320]  head of the group of superheroes Ozzy mandamus wears an all-seeing eye crown an all-seeing
[02:35.320 --> 02:44.640]  eye breastplate and I should have taken notes I should have written notes Saturday night watching
[02:44.640 --> 02:49.400]  a three-hour film because it was all in your face propaganda now people are saying why does
[02:49.400 --> 02:54.520]  a comic book matter well the globalist or psychopaths they like to brag they believe they
[02:54.520 --> 02:59.280]  get power out of admitting what they've done and what they're going to do and this is definitely
[02:59.280 --> 03:11.080]  one of those films because then I bought yesterday the actual Watchman book 40 bucks Alan Moore
[03:11.080 --> 03:19.520]  Dave Gibbons DC Comics one of a time magazine's 100 best novels that's what Time magazine had to
[03:19.520 --> 03:26.400]  say so this is the big novel you know of the Watchman condensing basically the whole story and
[03:26.400 --> 03:39.360]  so I read through it and so I could compare the novel to the film and they did do a few updates
[03:39.360 --> 03:50.240]  which only made it more in your face more pro-new world order it is serious serious serious business
[03:50.240 --> 03:56.480]  because remember Fox television ran the lone gunman where the government hijacks a jumbo jet by
[03:56.480 --> 04:01.640]  remote control the flight of the World Trade Center and the government uses norad drills
[04:01.640 --> 04:07.440]  anti-terror drills of the same targets being attacked at the same time to make norad stand
[04:07.440 --> 04:13.760]  down and they want to do it to blame it on Afghanistan and basically start the invasion of
[04:13.760 --> 04:20.640]  the Middle East and Central Asia and the government remote controls the aircraft that did indeed
[04:20.640 --> 04:28.160]  then happen a few months later and it you know just studying low-level psychopaths the kind that
[04:28.160 --> 04:33.440]  go out and grab women and children off the street to torture them to death you know they like to
[04:33.440 --> 04:38.080]  brag to the police they like to leave signals they like to warn people beforehand it's more fun
[04:38.080 --> 04:46.440]  for them and it's the same thing with this so just amazing that's coming up later got a ton of
[04:46.440 --> 04:53.000]  news cyber security chief resigns over the police state here in the US World Bank offers dire

[08:30.680 --> 08:37.480]  do a review of the watchman film number one at the box office a vicious threat to the people of the
[08:37.480 --> 08:46.840]  world the complete illuminati religion revealed to everyone and i uh did a little crash course
[08:46.840 --> 08:52.360]  on the watchman as i said yesterday spent a few hours researching it several people in my office
[08:52.360 --> 08:56.600]  are fans of the comic and had been telling me that i had to read it and had to look at it
[08:57.960 --> 09:03.720]  and then i uh google reviews of it and most reviews for the watchman are saying we don't
[09:03.720 --> 09:09.320]  understand it you know the new york times and seeing and we don't get the ending of the movie we
[09:09.320 --> 09:17.000]  don't understand it i don't believe that for a minute they understand it all too well how could
[09:17.000 --> 09:26.040]  someone not understand this film who works for the establishment it is truly disgusting i'll give
[09:26.040 --> 09:34.840]  you a hint of what's coming up they show the comedian as he's known a special forces killer
[09:34.840 --> 09:39.560]  blow jfk's head off from behind the picket fence at the grassy knoll
[09:43.720 --> 09:49.800]  to give me an idea but all of it is for your own good i'll i'll i'll just leave it at that
[09:49.800 --> 09:53.240]  this is a disgusting message to everyone
[09:56.120 --> 10:01.240]  in fact i think i'm going to go see it again and write notes on it and and do a more detailed
[10:01.240 --> 10:14.440]  write-up on the film just just amazing absolutely mind boggling we don't spend a lot of time on
[10:14.440 --> 10:21.480]  comic books here but this is a cultural phenomenon and this is clearly a revelation of the method
[10:22.680 --> 10:23.960]  predictive programming
[10:23.960 --> 10:31.560]  my point is you'll definitely want to join us coming up in two hours from now
[10:32.360 --> 10:39.160]  because i'm going to detail this film okay here's the headlines
[10:45.400 --> 10:50.600]  cyber security chief resigns the government's coordinator for cyber security programs is
[10:50.600 --> 10:56.280]  quit criticizing what he describes as the national security agencies grip on cyber security
[10:59.960 --> 11:08.920]  rob brextorm a former silicon valley entrepreneur said in his resignation letter that nasa's
[11:08.920 --> 11:16.600]  central the nsa's central role in cyber security is a bad strategy because it is important to have
[11:16.600 --> 11:22.440]  a civilian agency taking a key role in the issue the nsa is part of the defense department
[11:23.720 --> 11:29.320]  yes the defense department is taking over every facet of society notice now that different heads
[11:29.320 --> 11:34.760]  of federal agencies including fema and the deputy heads when they had press conferences it'll be a
[11:34.760 --> 11:43.080]  general or an admiral north com is the controlling military force over the us they've announced
[11:43.080 --> 11:48.040]  here in austin you know new york got two billion bucks to put in police cameras chicago got two
[11:48.040 --> 11:54.920]  billion bucks new york got billions bop boston got billions austin's getting hundreds of millions
[11:54.920 --> 12:01.240]  of dollars to put up more cameras and microphones and listen and track the people of the city where
[12:01.240 --> 12:07.080]  i live and it's all defense department run so i'll get into that now it ties into cyber security
[12:07.080 --> 12:14.120]  another headline here world bank offers dire forecast for world economy international herald
[12:14.120 --> 12:20.360]  tribune in a bleaker assessment than those of most private forecasters the world bank predicted
[12:20.360 --> 12:27.080]  sunday the global economy would shrink in 2009 for the first time since world war two well i have
[12:27.080 --> 12:33.640]  a bbc report they actually said that it is shrinking for the first time but more spin from the media
[12:33.640 --> 12:37.880]  the bank did not provide any specific estimate but bank officials said its economists
[12:37.880 --> 12:45.160]  would be publishing one in the next several weeks check leader joins meeting of climate
[12:45.160 --> 12:51.720]  change deniers that's right that's the london guardian's headline you're a holocaust denier
[12:51.720 --> 12:58.440]  they say it's on par with that you're a denier and now governments and psychiatric organizations
[12:58.440 --> 13:05.560]  are saying they want to make it a mental disorder to say that a climate change isn't normal part
[13:05.560 --> 13:11.960]  of the cycle and that b that it's the sun doing it al gore in front of the wall street journal
[13:11.960 --> 13:18.040]  conference you can watch the video clip up on info wars dot com prison planet dot com friday
[13:18.040 --> 13:22.040]  with boon pickens i'm gonna play this later if i have time
[13:22.040 --> 13:30.920]  time was up there saying it's unanimous with scientists and that thousands of scientists
[13:30.920 --> 13:35.640]  have told the u in any unanimous report that it's manmade global warming and it's deadly
[13:37.000 --> 13:41.240]  now meanwhile hundreds and hundreds of those two thousand scientists have said we never signed
[13:41.240 --> 13:46.840]  on to this we were just invited to this conference and we went to this conference and then suddenly
[13:46.840 --> 13:54.360]  our names were added to a list and there are over 30 000 scientists and engineers and meteorologists
[13:54.360 --> 14:02.440]  and others that have signed letters 30 000 saying it's a complete fraud and by the way the earth's
[14:02.440 --> 14:07.800]  been cooling now of the last year and a half at record pace because the sun suddenly cooled
[14:08.600 --> 14:14.120]  i mean how ashenine folks oh no humans are causing warming or change it's not the sun
[14:14.120 --> 14:22.440]  the sun has nothing to do with eating the earth give me a break so we'll go over that
[14:25.960 --> 14:31.720]  headline from the jerusalem post iran has crossed the nuclear tech threshold
[14:34.920 --> 14:41.000]  iran has crossed the nuclear tech threshold in a chilling indication that iran's arm program
[14:41.000 --> 14:45.880]  is advancing steadily israel acknowledged for the first time that tehran has mastered the
[14:45.880 --> 14:50.360]  technology to make a nuclear bomb on the same day that the iranians announced they had successfully
[14:50.360 --> 14:59.640]  tested a new air-to-air surface missile air-to-surface missile this is uh the same israeli government
[14:59.640 --> 15:06.680]  the same u.s government that told us iraq had mastered making a bombs or hydrogen bombs
[15:06.680 --> 15:13.720]  it's absolute complete total lie there are un inspectors all over tehran's program
[15:15.480 --> 15:21.400]  it is completely peaceful but the media doesn't care they want to attack another country
[15:21.400 --> 15:25.320]  and then they'll claim another nation's has nukes and then another and then another and another
[15:27.240 --> 15:32.520]  soon they'll claim that a baseball bat is a nuclear weapon by the way israel has
[15:32.520 --> 15:43.480]  conservatively 400 high-tech nukes tehran though they build them as a bunch of crazy islamic
[15:44.920 --> 15:51.000]  fascist or whatever is not insane and simply wants a balance of power but the cia says
[15:51.000 --> 15:55.880]  they're seven years away from having a nuke if they're left alone meanwhile israel's saying we
[15:55.880 --> 16:01.480]  have to strike we have to strike and i'm watching the mainstream media now and seeing harder
[16:01.480 --> 16:07.400]  rhetoric towards iran than we saw under bush so they are certainly considering striking iran right
[16:07.400 --> 16:17.480]  now iran using nuclear talks to buy time for a bomb says israel this out of the associated press
[16:17.480 --> 16:21.960]  iran is trying to use the talks of western powers on its nuclear ambitions to buy time to produce
[16:21.960 --> 16:27.480]  an atomic bomb israel's military intelligence chief said on sunday iran has crossed the
[16:27.480 --> 16:33.240]  technological threshold reaching a military-grade nuclear capability in a question of synchronizing
[16:33.240 --> 16:40.760]  its strategy with the production of a nuclear bombs and major general amos yadlin told cabinet
[16:40.760 --> 16:46.760]  ministers iran continues to stockpile hundreds of kilograms of low-level enriched uranium and hopes
[16:46.760 --> 16:53.320]  to use the dialogue with the west to buy time it requires to in order to move towards an ability
[16:53.320 --> 16:59.000]  to manufacture a nuclear bomb but he just contradicted himself in that line with the
[16:59.720 --> 17:03.800]  level of purified uranium they have all they can do is set up peaceful reactors
[17:05.720 --> 17:12.120]  they can't build a bomb with that us president barack obama has signaled a willingness to engage
[17:12.120 --> 17:17.960]  in talks with iran in a bid to resolve the nuclear standoff the five veto wielding permanent members
[17:17.960 --> 17:22.840]  of the un security council in germany announced last week that they were ready for direct talks with
[17:22.840 --> 17:29.080]  iran resolve the long-running crisis you know the issue here is the united states under federal law
[17:29.080 --> 17:36.040]  cannot give aid to any foreign country and israel gets record amounts of aid basically free money
[17:36.040 --> 17:42.200]  one is about six billion a year you add it all together military aid and cash if they're not a
[17:42.200 --> 17:49.720]  signatory to the nuclear nonproliferation act but israel openly has nuclear weapons and is allowed
[17:49.720 --> 17:58.280]  to go by rules that no one else has to follow and that's classic with the globalist system
[17:58.280 --> 18:02.840]  everything the globalists do you know they're allowed to break all the rules they don't have
[18:02.840 --> 18:06.120]  to follow their own rules but then everybody else has to follow their global government rules
[18:07.640 --> 18:12.120]  i mean russia had all these nukes did we have a nuclear war with them no pakistan has nukes
[18:12.120 --> 18:19.320]  nukes it's actually more unstable than iran does have a bunch of extremists you know anyway you
[18:19.320 --> 18:27.560]  cut it living there meanwhile the united states israel and britain you can just google israel
[18:27.560 --> 18:33.560]  helped pakistan get nuked us helped pakistan get nuked haliburton subsidiary helped pakistan
[18:33.560 --> 18:40.120]  get nuked bush blocks fbi investigations of aq con clinton blocks investigations of aq con
[18:40.120 --> 18:45.480]  you know they help arm these people they they distribute the weapons systems to destabilize
[18:45.480 --> 18:50.680]  the whole region between india pakistan and china and then meanwhile they're shaking their finger at
[18:50.680 --> 18:56.760]  iran who isn't anywhere near getting an atomic weapon and by the way atomics are nothing compared
[18:56.760 --> 19:02.760]  unless you have a wide-scale war atomics are nothing compared to biological weapons
[19:02.760 --> 19:17.720]  so we'll go over that today north korea warns intercepting satellite will prompt counter
[19:17.720 --> 19:22.840]  strike they're saying that if anybody shoots down their satellite launch that is clearly
[19:22.840 --> 19:35.080]  an icbm test remember what happened seven years ago they tested an icbm and hit alaska
[19:35.800 --> 19:39.320]  in the news media spun it and said well it's no big deal it was just a
[19:39.320 --> 19:44.520]  satellite test that went wrong by the way they clearly have primitive atomic weapons over there
[19:44.520 --> 19:50.760]  but that's okay let them shoot missiles at us and we'll just call it a satellite test again
[19:50.760 --> 19:55.960]  that's no problem though let's just attack iran they're they're gonna attack iran because iran is
[19:55.960 --> 20:05.640]  weak not because they're strong life change t sets the standard have you heard on radio all the new

[26:14.120 --> 26:21.080]  is is because the illegal aliens are killing so many police and kidnapping so many well-to-do people
[26:21.080 --> 26:25.480]  that finally the establishment is getting concerned you see they wanted the illegal aliens to break
[26:25.480 --> 26:30.200]  down the sovereign the united states all 30 million of them to bankrupt the states with all the free
[26:30.200 --> 26:35.480]  health care and the rest of it that the feds have ordered the states if they take federal money

[27:48.440 --> 27:59.240]  crimes total cop out pun intended there above the law i've had austin police admit to me and i've
[27:59.240 --> 28:04.840]  seen mainstream news articles all over the country that illegal aliens at these checkpoints they set
[28:04.840 --> 28:09.400]  up that are warrantless won't have drivers license won't have insurance they just wave them through
[28:09.400 --> 28:13.160]  because the judges have told them hey there's nothing we can do about these people we just
[28:13.160 --> 28:19.560]  release them so they let them go they let them go when they wreck and kill you and your family
[28:21.000 --> 28:25.480]  i've seen headlines out of the houston chronicle where hundreds of thousands of illegal aliens
[28:25.480 --> 28:32.920]  are released every year just in texas alone who've committed serious crimes
[28:35.080 --> 28:39.640]  their presence in ruthless tactics are largely unknown to most here this is out of us today

[29:29.640 --> 29:34.920]  funerals big lines crying whining freaking out about it but when the illegal aliens kill cops
[29:34.920 --> 29:42.840]  it's all kept very quiet because they know if the cop unions wake up to this the police

[33:21.240 --> 33:27.720]  in the year of 92 so what have we heard from the attorney general eric holder he says we've
[33:27.720 --> 33:34.360]  got to have more restrictions on the second amendment because guns from the united states
[33:35.000 --> 33:40.200]  are going down to mexico that's actually a lie most the weapons are being sold by corrupt
[33:40.200 --> 33:45.560]  individuals inside the u.s military and also the german government sells directly to the mexican
[33:45.560 --> 33:51.560]  military who then sells it to the cartels which they control and the allied crime cartels with
[33:51.560 --> 33:55.480]  the mexican government are going after the smaller cartels that's what this whole war
[33:55.480 --> 34:02.120]  is about but it doesn't matter u.s a today then goes back into demonizing the second amendment
[34:02.120 --> 34:08.040]  and as a photo at the top of the page it says a d a field agent packs up weapons they were
[34:08.040 --> 34:15.800]  confiscated during a raid in guanette county georgia and they again say oh my gosh mexico's
[34:15.800 --> 34:21.640]  collapsing there's all this crime because the government's had an open door to these 30 million
[34:21.640 --> 34:30.600]  illegal aliens all of them criminals violating the law it's just amazing
[34:30.600 --> 34:39.000]  so the headline mexican cartels plague atlanta here's another one out of us say today illegal
[34:39.000 --> 34:46.680]  immigrants might get stimulus jobs experts say and one of obama's appointees robert
[34:46.680 --> 34:52.520]  rike has come out and said you can just google robert rike says that he wants to make sure
[34:52.520 --> 34:57.800]  quote white males don't get the stimulus money and much of the stimulus money will go to the
[34:57.800 --> 35:02.440]  illegal aliens because the states and the feds hire them they use illegal aliens to build the
[35:02.440 --> 35:09.160]  tiny areas of the border fence they have put in tens of thousands of jobs created by the
[35:09.160 --> 35:15.720]  economic stimulus law could end up filled by illegal immigrants particularly in big cities
[35:15.720 --> 35:20.200]  such as california where undocumented workers are heavily represented in construction experts on
[35:20.200 --> 35:24.520]  both sides of the issue say studies by two conservative think tanks estimate immigrants
[35:24.520 --> 35:32.680]  in the united states illegally could take 300 million dollars in construction jobs
[35:33.400 --> 35:39.240]  could take 300 000 construction jobs excuse me as it's more than 300 million or 15 percent of the
[35:39.240 --> 35:45.720]  two million jobs that the new taxpayer finance projects are predicted to create they fault
[35:45.720 --> 35:51.160]  congress for failing to require that employers certify illegal immigration status of workers
[35:51.160 --> 35:57.880]  before hiring by using a department of homeland security program called e-verified that's right
[35:57.880 --> 36:05.880]  they put in the stimulus package that the federal database that citizens are registered through
[36:05.880 --> 36:11.640]  whenever they get a job whether it's in a hot dog place or a video store or working on a golf
[36:11.640 --> 36:16.840]  course or working at a bank it doesn't matter citizens have to go through e-fair verify to have
[36:16.840 --> 36:20.920]  a job and the feds are saying in the near future you haven't paid your taxes or haven't paid all
[36:20.920 --> 36:25.560]  your fines or fees you're just going to be fired because they're going to tell your employer oh
[36:25.560 --> 36:29.640]  that person is not eligible to have a job that's what homeland security is all about and i'll never
[36:29.640 --> 36:34.440]  forget six years ago seeing the first head of homeland security governor ridge say on c span
[36:34.440 --> 36:39.560]  they were going to do that but the illegals are exempt i remember in texas when they were promoting
[36:39.560 --> 36:44.680]  thumb scanning a decade ago to get a driver's license and a digital photo it turned out that
[36:44.680 --> 36:51.560]  texas put in a clause where the illegal aliens were basically exempt from that
[36:51.800 --> 36:55.960]  it goes on to say the program allows employers to check for the viability of social security
[36:55.960 --> 37:02.760]  numbers provided by new hires it is available to employers on a voluntary basis that's not true
[37:02.760 --> 37:09.080]  health and human services to the state departments of labor and to the feds demand that you do that
[37:09.080 --> 37:15.160]  if you're paying taxes if you're paying withholding but the illegal aliens are exempt from that
[37:15.960 --> 37:20.280]  it's another example of the complete lawlessness of the criminals that run the federal government
[37:20.280 --> 37:24.840]  everything they're doing is designed will take the amnesty plan they tried to pass two years ago
[37:24.840 --> 37:29.960]  that they said was secret in congress they said trust us it's not an amnesty plan and then senator
[37:29.960 --> 37:34.840]  sessions leaked the bill gotten trouble for it not supposed to american people know a bill
[37:34.840 --> 37:39.880]  and it said that all illegal aliens would be legalized anyone that wanted to come here for
[37:39.880 --> 37:43.640]  six years could come the people that were already here could then bring their family members here
[37:43.640 --> 37:50.120]  and that even felons who were in the united states illegally and committed crimes could stay as us
[37:50.120 --> 38:00.760]  citizens i mean that's the level that we're talking about here so throw the book at citizens
[38:00.760 --> 38:07.960]  squeeze the citizens but literally worship the illegal aliens here's another story out of the
[38:07.960 --> 38:15.160]  houston chronicle today mexican cartels infiltrate houston recent arrests in a mistaken killing
[38:15.160 --> 38:20.920]  point to a perilous presence of gangs houston based head of the mexican drug cartel cell
[38:20.920 --> 38:24.280]  pumping millions of dollars of cocaine into the city walked away
[38:24.280 --> 38:27.480]  hey
[38:27.640 --> 38:33.080]  peres 27 was just a working guy out getting dinner late on friday with his wife and young
[38:33.080 --> 38:40.760]  children at chelos a seafood restaurant on the gulf freeway his murder and the assassination
[38:40.760 --> 38:45.560]  gone awry point to the perilous presence of mexican organized crime and how cartel violence
[38:45.560 --> 38:51.160]  has seeped into the city arrests came in december when police and federal agents got a break in the
[38:51.160 --> 39:00.200]  2006 shooting as they charted the relationship and rivalries between at least five cartel cells
[39:00.200 --> 39:07.160]  operating in houston a rogues gallery of about 100 names and mugshots taken at texas jails and
[39:07.160 --> 39:15.160]  morgues offered a blueprint of mexican organized crime houston has long been a major staging
[39:15.160 --> 39:18.520]  ground for importing legal drugs from mexico and shipping them to the rest of united states
[39:18.520 --> 39:21.160]  but a recent department of justice report notes
[39:24.040 --> 39:29.400]  that it is one of 230 cities where cartels maintain distribution networks and supply lines
[39:32.360 --> 39:35.880]  at chelos the real crime boss was sitting at another table
[39:37.400 --> 39:43.160]  as were the two spotters the hitman waited in the parking lot for peres to leave the restaurant
[39:43.160 --> 39:47.400]  i just remember the guy coming up to us he started shooting and shooting and shooting and shooting
[39:47.400 --> 39:52.120]  and never stopped said norma gonzalez peres's widow he was hit twice
[39:57.240 --> 40:01.320]  and it just goes on to talk about all the murders in houston and how bad it's getting
[40:05.400 --> 40:12.440]  meanwhile bernie madeoff is a circus side show attraction curtain info wars dot com
[40:12.440 --> 40:18.760]  it looks like ponzi scammer and former chairman of the nasdaq bernie madeoff will be allowed to
[40:18.760 --> 40:25.800]  enter a plea deal with prosecutors it is possible he may not see the inside of a prison cell but
[40:25.800 --> 40:30.680]  more likely he will get a light sentence and be shipped off to one of those golf club minimum
[40:30.680 --> 40:38.120]  security facilities reserved for wealthy criminals prosecutors who have charged him with operating
[40:38.120 --> 40:46.440]  an alleged 500 billion ponzi scheme notified a 50 billion dollar ponzi scheme notified a federal
[40:46.440 --> 40:52.360]  judge on friday that madeoff had agreed to forego a grand jury hearing a step that is typical
[40:54.280 --> 40:58.840]  a precursor to a plea agreement reports the business mirror it's not inconceivable that
[40:58.840 --> 41:05.320]  bernie madeoff could avoid doing one day in jail said brad simon a new york defense attorney
[41:05.320 --> 41:10.040]  and why is the system treating him with such kid gloves why is he allowed to stay in a 60
[41:10.040 --> 41:15.480]  million dollar penthouse why is he allowed to ship out kegs of gold and diamonds and jewels
[41:15.480 --> 41:20.680]  to his family that's now run off to south america why is he allowed to keep billions of his stolen
[41:20.680 --> 41:30.120]  goods because he's the founder of the nasdaq he's a top globalist because it's come out even the
[41:30.120 --> 41:35.160]  mainstream news that every major international bank was tied in with madeoff and the securities
[41:35.160 --> 41:41.720]  and exchange commission a month ago in testimony before congress said that it was a national
[41:41.720 --> 41:46.040]  security issue and that's why they wouldn't answer questions about burning madeoff and they
[41:46.040 --> 41:55.720]  declared presidential prerogative to not answer congress's questions the real numbers we've seen
[41:55.720 --> 42:06.360]  with madeoff is over a hundred billion dollars leveraged hurt never goes on to say burning
[42:06.360 --> 42:10.040]  madeoff should serve the remainder of his life in the sort of prison reserve the rest of us
[42:10.040 --> 42:15.720]  he should spend his remaining days on planet earth with bank robbers stick up men con artists and
[42:15.720 --> 42:21.880]  other sociopaths all of this is a media circus distraction it's a way to deflect the righteous
[42:21.880 --> 42:26.360]  anger of the vast majority of people who are about to suffer mightily under the collapsing
[42:26.360 --> 42:35.240]  Ponzi scheme known as the global economy after burning madeoff is packed off to prison if he
[42:35.240 --> 42:40.360]  is packed off to prison people need to call for the arrest and prosecution of the real economic
[42:40.360 --> 42:47.080]  criminals it's about time the high muckety mucks and leman brothers maryl Lynch city group bear
[42:47.080 --> 42:53.160]  sterns jp morgan goldman sacks will covia fanny may et cetera be arrested paraded around an orange
[42:53.160 --> 42:58.680]  jumpsuits and prosecuted the foolish extent of the law because they openly did violate thousands
[42:58.680 --> 43:06.040]  of laws over and over again hundreds of laws thousands of times to be technical of course
[43:06.040 --> 43:11.640]  before this rogues gallery faces arrest the Ponzi scheme don should be apprehended hank Paulson
[43:11.640 --> 43:17.480]  allen greenspan bernackie and their underlings and minions like kosh kari the federal reserve should
[43:17.480 --> 43:27.800]  be burned to the ground and salt poured over the ashes that's what kurt has to say and i i agree
[43:27.800 --> 43:30.600]  it should be legally done a law should be passed and it should be
[43:32.600 --> 43:36.360]  actually turned into a museum of banking crimes so people understand who the real
[43:36.360 --> 43:41.640]  enemy is the bankers i don't i don't agree with her i don't believe that we did that it should be
[43:41.640 --> 43:54.200]  leveled i mean we don't level um alschwitz we shouldn't level areas in africa where the
[43:54.200 --> 44:00.200]  slave ships were packed with tens of millions of humanity it should be left there for all to see
[44:00.200 --> 44:04.840]  and we should be educated about who the mortal enemies are of any free nation the private bankers
[44:04.840 --> 44:15.560]  as our forefathers warned us over and over again and none of these globalists should be executed
[44:15.560 --> 44:20.840]  they should be in public reviewing cages after they've been convicted of a jury of their peers
[44:22.840 --> 44:26.520]  so everybody can understand who these people are but don't think they're going to turn
[44:26.520 --> 44:30.760]  elusive power lightly ladies and gentlemen in fact they've maneuvered themselves to not even get in
[44:30.760 --> 44:36.600]  trouble but to pose as the saviors of society and so they have to let bernie madoff go easy
[44:37.240 --> 44:42.440]  because he was involved in a scam fencing money out of the country for globalist operations
[44:42.440 --> 44:44.360]  all over the western world including israel
[44:48.760 --> 44:52.040]  but of course they're not going to let bernie madoff get any real trouble
[44:52.040 --> 44:56.360]  they're going to go out and find some little nobodies you know who did a hundred million
[44:56.360 --> 45:00.760]  dollar deal or a five million dollar deal or an eight hundred thousand dollar deal that that that
[45:00.760 --> 45:06.280]  might have bent the law a little bit remember mark cuban was going to distribute through his
[45:06.280 --> 45:11.720]  twenty nine twenty nine loose change final cut in theaters and then i heard through the grapevine
[45:12.680 --> 45:16.520]  that he'd been called up and threatened that we're going to go over everything you've done
[45:16.520 --> 45:20.920]  financially with the fine tooth comb and you're going to go to prison if you release that film so
[45:20.920 --> 45:26.760]  he backed out of it and then later the new york times released the emails because mark cuban
[45:26.760 --> 45:31.480]  released them after he was indicted by the sec the same ones protecting madoff
[45:34.120 --> 45:40.680]  in a stock deal for a few hundred thousand dollars where he just sold some of his stock a few days
[45:40.680 --> 45:45.880]  before the stock went down completely legal completely lawful something he wasn't even paying
[45:45.880 --> 45:52.120]  attention to with his three to four billion dollars in holdings we've got three billion in cash and
[45:52.120 --> 45:56.760]  billions and billions in holdings and now the emails have been released where they were threatening
[45:56.760 --> 46:01.960]  him you piece of filth putting out this nine eleven film we're going to get you and phone calls
[46:01.960 --> 46:08.840]  that were made to him with the sec openly threatening him and then opening the investigation on him
[46:08.840 --> 46:15.640]  culminating three months ago with his indictment and he is fighting it that's who the sec goes after
[46:16.760 --> 46:23.720]  didn't steal a dime from anybody made all of his money through the internet through sales of his
[46:23.720 --> 46:30.600]  conglomerate to yahoo owning sports teams and media companies
[46:34.280 --> 46:38.600]  and i wasn't allowed to talk about it because it was in confidence that i learned all of this
[46:38.600 --> 46:44.520]  a year and a half ago i just had to say that people been intimidated and threatened and
[46:48.280 --> 46:51.720]  people's children were threatened as well but i'm i'm you know i'm not going to go into it
[46:51.720 --> 46:54.680]  anymore people don't want me to so i'm just gonna leave it at that
[46:58.840 --> 47:04.840]  yeah folks were told we will kill your children that's who we deal with ladies and gentlemen
[47:04.840 --> 47:09.880]  you think i'm playing games here when we make these films you think this is a this isn't a game
[47:09.880 --> 47:17.320]  this isn't a joke this is the real world the new world order is real so real they sick the sec on
[47:17.320 --> 47:28.280]  people so real people who are just looking at being producers within days of them coming into the
[47:28.280 --> 47:36.680]  project are getting home visits saying do you want your children to end up dead
[47:40.120 --> 47:46.360]  oh 9 11 is not an inside job they just sick the sec on mark cuban and go to a producer and threaten
[47:46.360 --> 47:55.000]  his children all of our phones surveilled everything we're doing being listened to
[47:55.000 --> 48:02.120]  this happened within 48 hours before mark cuban was even on the project
[48:06.360 --> 48:11.880]  and you imagine meeting up you know at a big palace like houses overlooking the hollywood sign
[48:12.440 --> 48:17.640]  and having major producers household names sit there and talk about their family being threatened
[48:17.640 --> 48:25.800]  can you imagine the magnitude of how much that brings it home to you how real this is
[48:30.520 --> 48:36.600]  and then watching our own quote patriot movement just out of jealousy celebrate when loose change
[48:36.600 --> 48:42.200]  final cut didn't go in theaters because of jealousy of me and jealousy of other people
[48:42.200 --> 48:47.880]  people like charlie sheen charlie sheen was taking a huge risk doing that charlie wouldn't
[48:47.880 --> 48:52.280]  back off and told him to go to hell and you know what happened suddenly you saw all those
[48:52.280 --> 49:02.280]  horrible news pieces about charlie sheen and oh charlie sheen his ex-wife in the divorce

[49:13.080 --> 49:18.600]  off with them to the fbi and they went all through them and couldn't find anything to nail him
[49:19.240 --> 49:23.240]  and so she went out and said well a lot one time i saw him looking at something called
[49:23.240 --> 49:27.160]  barely legal which they have of course in hotel rooms on the tv sets now
[49:27.160 --> 49:35.480]  and i know a lot more of the back story he was told you shut up or we're going to destroy you
[49:35.480 --> 49:39.720]  and charlie sheen said you know what that's all lies about me you go ahead and do it and they
[49:39.720 --> 49:46.200]  did it he survived it but that's how real this is people's children being threatened
[49:48.280 --> 49:50.600]  people having lies made up about them
[49:50.600 --> 50:02.920]  that's how real all of this is ladies and gentlemen that's what i get up every morning
[50:02.920 --> 50:10.440]  and face and deal with knowing they could kill me or set me up any day that's not the exception
[50:10.440 --> 50:16.200]  with the feds that's the rule but i just put my life in the hands of god and whatever god

[1:01:52.520 --> 1:01:57.800]  that's in the stack and of course the last year they've been having the army show up at checkpoints
[1:01:57.800 --> 1:02:04.520]  in major cities quote to stop rowdy drinkers and we of course rightfully said that is preconditioning
[1:02:04.520 --> 1:02:08.760]  ahead of full military occupation of canada and indeed that's happened we're going through the
[1:02:08.760 --> 1:02:14.440]  same acclamation right now but i find canadian's don't stand together and when you go to talking
[1:02:14.440 --> 1:02:17.880]  about the things they just they're a fleet the one thing i wanted to bring to your attention
[1:02:17.880 --> 1:02:23.480]  alex is that in in my children's school district that this has come out they're suspending all the
[1:02:23.480 --> 1:02:30.200]  students now um for um not getting vaccinations or proving that you have vaccinations so my
[1:02:30.200 --> 1:02:35.560]  children's school are now being suspended because we are not proving that that's right but but again
[1:02:35.560 --> 1:02:41.880]  canada is the same as england of the u.s there's no law there is a waiver but that gives the color
[1:02:41.880 --> 1:02:47.640]  of law but you have to demand the religious or conscientious objector's data to be able to put
[1:02:47.640 --> 1:02:51.960]  your children back in the camp but why would you want them in the camp and i know they work you so
[1:02:51.960 --> 1:02:56.680]  hard that you can't be there to take care of them so you need to i guess get a second or third job
[1:02:56.680 --> 1:03:00.840]  or your husband or whoever that's why they want to break families up so we're not self-sufficient
[1:03:00.840 --> 1:03:05.640]  and so that we can be institutionalized uh but yes the schools are little prisons
[1:03:05.640 --> 1:03:09.160]  and they're setting the precedent to forcibly vaccinate everybody so look out
[1:03:10.360 --> 1:03:14.920]  yeah well i just want to thank you alex for all that you're doing and um uh hopefully we can all
[1:03:14.920 --> 1:03:21.320]  stand together against these uh policy theory and control freak tonight i don't empty your position
[1:03:21.320 --> 1:03:27.000]  because uh i pray for you regularly and um i just continue to support you and hope that you
[1:03:27.000 --> 1:03:32.920]  are being blessed for all that you're doing for us as a people well thank you thank you

[1:08:14.440 --> 1:08:20.360]  minutes of the show today i'm gonna have greg pound of free our kids dot com joining us his
[1:08:20.360 --> 1:08:24.680]  children were kidnapped because a neighbor dog bit one of their children on the hand and they were
[1:08:24.680 --> 1:08:33.800]  homeschooling their children and it later came out and the cps lady that did it lost her job
[1:08:33.800 --> 1:08:38.920]  because she falsified reports in hundreds of cases that was in the newspaper but several years later
[1:08:38.920 --> 1:08:43.640]  he still hasn't gotten his children back so he's a big activist that tracks the government kidnapping
[1:08:43.640 --> 1:08:49.880]  children all over the country and he's confirmed that all over florida right now where he's located
[1:08:50.600 --> 1:08:55.560]  they are now coming and cpsing people's children homeschooler christian children
[1:08:56.360 --> 1:09:01.000]  who they're targeting if they haven't been vaccinated now there's no law in florida you've
[1:09:01.000 --> 1:09:05.800]  got to be vaccinated with these deadly bio weapons that are killing and maiming so many
[1:09:06.760 --> 1:09:15.720]  how are they doing it well they just break the law and the family courts were set up
[1:09:16.280 --> 1:09:21.080]  90 years ago in the u.s as the eugenics courts they were known as the
[1:09:23.000 --> 1:09:27.560]  racial hygiene courts of the united states and they were set up extra judicially
[1:09:27.560 --> 1:09:34.120]  outside of the state chartered courts they were just set up there's no jury no nothing in the name
[1:09:34.120 --> 1:09:41.800]  of protecting the children which is the opposite there's no due process no nothing and they say
[1:09:41.800 --> 1:09:46.680]  it's in danger meant to not shoot them up with all these shots and so they take the children
[1:09:48.120 --> 1:09:52.680]  there's no law but they take the children now how do they put children in jail and parents in
[1:09:52.680 --> 1:09:58.600]  jail that are going to government camps they will expel you claiming you violated the school's policy
[1:09:58.600 --> 1:10:06.360]  not a law for not taking the shots then once the truancy accrues they arrest you and your children
[1:10:06.360 --> 1:10:11.960]  for truancy never telling you that you can withdraw your children anytime you want it's all color of
[1:10:11.960 --> 1:10:20.280]  law yet again so they expel the child or children this is how the trick works very simple people
[1:10:20.280 --> 1:10:26.680]  miss this they trigger a criminal statute by expelling the children but they're
[1:10:28.040 --> 1:10:34.200]  have to give you a waiver for the policy which isn't a law but they don't tell the parents that
[1:10:35.160 --> 1:10:39.880]  then they tell them in places like maryland remember that case where they thousands of them
[1:10:39.880 --> 1:10:42.920]  lined up and they had the police dogs and the germanshepers barking at the kids and the kids
[1:10:42.920 --> 1:10:46.680]  are crying i don't want the shots the parents say we don't want the shots but it's the law
[1:10:46.680 --> 1:10:51.960]  i'll be arrested well no it had been triggered because they had expelled the children wouldn't
[1:10:51.960 --> 1:10:56.360]  let them in school and then triggered law there and then said show up at this court hearing
[1:10:56.360 --> 1:11:03.320]  or you'll be arrested all slide of hand all fraud that's what this criminal beastial wicked
[1:11:03.320 --> 1:11:07.640]  degenerate viperous lecherous government does
[1:11:10.360 --> 1:11:15.000]  it's all about conning you all about defrauding you and the and the eugenicists that run the
[1:11:15.000 --> 1:11:20.440]  country want you to take these injections they want the precedent set to force them on you
[1:11:21.400 --> 1:11:25.240]  it doesn't matter how many people the bird flu vaccine kills it doesn't matter how many people
[1:11:25.240 --> 1:11:29.720]  the h pv shot kills it doesn't matter how many people the tetanus shot kills it doesn't matter
[1:11:29.720 --> 1:11:34.280]  how many people are dead and how many people that's admitted these things are killing they will
[1:11:34.280 --> 1:11:42.040]  continue the injections it doesn't matter of the all the major vaccines admittedly when they're
[1:11:42.040 --> 1:11:46.600]  tested have different cancer viruses in them. It doesn't matter. You will take it and you
[1:11:46.600 --> 1:11:55.200]  will die because the government loves you. It is illegitimate. It is degenerate. It
[1:11:55.200 --> 1:12:03.680]  is a complete stinking fraud from pillar to post. Let's go back to your calls. Brett
[1:12:03.680 --> 1:12:13.200]  in Montana. Go ahead, Brett. Thanks for having me on. I just wanted to ask you something
[1:12:13.200 --> 1:12:25.040]  about the WTO. The World Trade Organization? Yes, the WTO. I'm sorry. I'm just trying
[1:12:25.040 --> 1:12:32.000]  to educate myself on all of this. It's a private group set up in 1995 through treaty.
[1:12:32.000 --> 1:12:37.800]  The United States Congress has waived almost all of its rights over trade, over the U.S.
[1:12:37.800 --> 1:12:41.920]  to the foreign body. They can break the treaty or remove themselves from it, extricate themselves
[1:12:41.920 --> 1:12:46.600]  anytime they'd like. It's another private body ruling for the world government. Yes,
[1:12:46.600 --> 1:12:51.880]  sir. And I have actually been reading a little bit about it and I had a question for you
[1:12:51.880 --> 1:13:01.480]  because I was on their website and they say that it's a member-driven, it's member-driven
[1:13:01.480 --> 1:13:10.080]  and that it's ran by its member governments. So meaning that the members of the WTO are
[1:13:10.080 --> 1:13:17.640]  actually our own governments. Is that correct? Yes, there are representatives from the executive
[1:13:17.640 --> 1:13:23.760]  branch in the World Trade Organization. Okay. And there are seats in it but the point is
[1:13:23.760 --> 1:13:29.520]  is that the government itself, the legislatures or the parliaments have signed over authority
[1:13:29.520 --> 1:13:35.640]  to the body. Just like the European Union has two different bodies but rotating members
[1:13:35.640 --> 1:13:42.000]  from the countries run it but the body itself has removed any power the sovereign nations
[1:13:42.000 --> 1:13:52.600]  had left. On their website it goes on to explain that the areas of trade that they're in are
[1:13:52.600 --> 1:13:59.920]  intellectual property, services, capital, agriculture, etc. Here's an example. Obama
[1:13:59.920 --> 1:14:05.960]  just put out language about how the stimulus package with bids when they could it needed
[1:14:05.960 --> 1:14:12.440]  to be given to US companies to stimulate our economy and Brazil threatened with its membership
[1:14:12.440 --> 1:14:16.320]  in the World Trade Organization to block that and so they said, okay, we'll just give it
[1:14:16.320 --> 1:14:20.720]  to foreign companies. So that's an example of Congress and even the president not being
[1:14:20.720 --> 1:14:28.520]  able to exercise sovereignty. On their website they also have a list of their members and
[1:14:28.520 --> 1:14:37.000]  observers. 153 members as of the 23rd of July of 2008 and they even have the date of their
[1:14:37.000 --> 1:14:52.360]  membership. If you scroll down past the members it has a list of observers and in that list
[1:14:52.360 --> 1:15:02.800]  it is Holy See or the Vatican. Now what does the Vatican have to do with World Trade?
[1:15:02.800 --> 1:15:12.040]  I don't understand that. Is that a question? Yes, sir. Okay, I'll answer that. The Vatican
[1:15:12.040 --> 1:15:16.760]  has tens of trillions of dollars. It's one of the most wealthy institutions on the planet.
[1:15:16.760 --> 1:15:22.000]  The Vatican helped found the European Union under the Treaty of Rome, 1957. The Vatican
[1:15:22.000 --> 1:15:26.480]  openly says they're calling for world government, a new world order and that's why Tony Blair
[1:15:26.480 --> 1:15:31.320]  has converted to Catholicism. I'm not bashing Catholics here, folks, just a fact and called
[1:15:31.320 --> 1:15:35.740]  for a new world order so that Tony Blair can later be the head of the EU and he's been
[1:15:35.740 --> 1:15:42.880]  offered that slot down the road. So certainly the Vatican is involved in trade all over
[1:15:42.880 --> 1:15:49.320]  the planet and that's why you have the Vatican and the CIA and the FBI and MI5 and MI6 and
[1:15:49.320 --> 1:15:54.040]  the Rockefeller Foundation and the Carnegie Endowment. I would imagine I haven't looked
[1:15:54.040 --> 1:15:59.000]  at the list in years but you will see those groups as well listed in there.
[1:15:59.000 --> 1:16:05.160]  Well, thank you for your time, sir. You bet. I appreciate your call. Let's talk to Bob
[1:16:05.160 --> 1:16:12.200]  in Connecticut. Bob, you're on the air. Hello. Yes, sir. Yes, hopefully I don't have background
[1:16:12.200 --> 1:16:20.000]  noise. I started here just a minute ago. I'm trying to find out if I can. I know I can,
[1:16:20.000 --> 1:16:25.240]  but first of all, there's one verse in the Bible that said notice also that in the last
[1:16:25.240 --> 1:16:29.680]  day, perilous times shall come. I don't know if that's referring to this time or it could
[1:16:29.680 --> 1:16:35.480]  have been back in a depression or so on, but we are going to be facing perilous times according
[1:16:35.480 --> 1:16:40.600]  to everything you've been reporting. But I like to be able to help some people if that's
[1:16:40.600 --> 1:16:46.200]  possible if I can give a phone number and it'll be my personal phone number. Well, you know,
[1:16:46.200 --> 1:16:51.040]  we don't really like to do that because what we've had years ago was setups where somebody
[1:16:51.040 --> 1:16:55.840]  will call in and say they're one person and it's really somebody else's phone number.
[1:16:55.840 --> 1:17:01.440]  And there's some liability associated with that. And I don't really know you, Bob. I
[1:17:01.440 --> 1:17:04.960]  mean, you're saying you want to help people. Specifically, how do you want to help people?
[1:17:04.960 --> 1:17:16.960]  Can I give a website then? Sure, go ahead, Bob. Okay, www.zmo. That's x-i-m-o-l-h-e-a-l-t-h
[1:17:16.960 --> 1:17:19.120] .com. So you have a product that's going to help
[1:17:19.120 --> 1:17:28.720]  somebody? Well, it gives you some energy, gives you endurance, people work out. I appreciate
[1:17:28.720 --> 1:17:32.560]  the plug. It's just no other talk radio would allow that. I try to let everybody have their
[1:17:32.560 --> 1:17:36.280]  say, but if I let you do that, I actually, about 10 years ago, let anybody say whatever
[1:17:36.280 --> 1:17:40.440]  they wanted. People call up saying I got a tractor for sale in Missouri. Okay, and you
[1:17:40.440 --> 1:17:44.160]  know what? If you want to plug something, you got to bring some content to the show
[1:17:44.160 --> 1:17:51.400]  first and then work it in. But got your plug. I appreciate it, Bob. Steve in Toronto, Canada,
[1:17:51.400 --> 1:17:54.480]  you're on the air, Steve. Hey, Alex, how you doing?
[1:17:54.480 --> 1:17:58.080]  Good, sir. Yeah, I just wanted to call while I want
[1:17:58.080 --> 1:18:02.880]  to say that you have a giant heart. It's like the size of the sun. You know, it's huge.
[1:18:02.880 --> 1:18:08.920]  You're an amazing guy. I know you're going to do an analysis later of the watchman, but
[1:18:08.920 --> 1:18:13.160]  I just wanted to make a quick comment about it. I saw the film and I've read the comic
[1:18:13.160 --> 1:18:19.780]  and I followed Alan's work for quite a few years.
[1:18:19.780 --> 1:18:25.080]  Alan Moore, sorry. I know he had some problems with the film as well.
[1:18:25.080 --> 1:18:30.360]  Yeah, he doesn't actually like any of his writings being turned into films. He doesn't
[1:18:30.360 --> 1:18:34.240]  agree with it, but he's sold the rights to them, so it's up to whoever buys them to make
[1:18:34.240 --> 1:18:42.160]  the film, right? But I think the main point of that story is basically, you know, that
[1:18:42.160 --> 1:18:47.520]  there are people who think they're good out there, like say, like the Illuminati, who
[1:18:47.520 --> 1:18:54.880]  think that what they're doing to the planet, like whether it's annihilating millions of
[1:18:54.880 --> 1:18:59.360]  people, that they wake up in the morning and think that this is a good thing, this is good
[1:18:59.360 --> 1:19:09.160]  for the future. But it's lacking of love. But also, there are still people out there
[1:19:09.160 --> 1:19:14.240]  like you and who are going to stick it to the end and know who true justice is. For
[1:19:14.240 --> 1:19:18.520]  instance, the character Rorschach to me, I mean, not saying you're crazy, like anything,
[1:19:18.520 --> 1:19:24.120]  but he's sticking it out to the end and never giving up. And I think that's the real point,
[1:19:24.120 --> 1:19:30.000]  especially since the story ends kind of that way, you know, where it's like right to the
[1:19:30.000 --> 1:19:37.000]  end and willing to die for it, basically. So I think that's the true meaning of the story.
[1:19:37.000 --> 1:19:40.080]  But you know, if you want to know more about Alan Moore, you know, that he's got like a
[1:19:40.080 --> 1:19:44.160]  documentary called Mindscape of Alan Moore, and he's even asked about it. But Alan Moore
[1:19:44.160 --> 1:19:52.000]  is a Mason. Isn't Alan Moore a Mason? Yeah, absolutely. You're right. And he is asked
[1:19:52.000 --> 1:19:56.600]  about what he thinks about this whole conspiracy, but I mean, you might come to the same conclusion.
[1:19:56.600 --> 1:19:59.760]  Maybe we should try to get Alan Moore on the show. In fact, let's do that. Thanks for
[1:19:59.760 --> 1:20:03.440]  the call. This year, many of us will have to make the
[1:20:03.440 --> 1:20:08.960]  tough decision on what to cut back on and what's essential as we prepare for an uncertain
[1:20:08.960 --> 1:20:13.160]  future. In these troubled times, one of the most important things your family can have
[1:20:13.160 --> 1:20:17.800]  is good health. Some of the contributors to poor health are parasites, viruses, toxins
[1:20:17.800 --> 1:20:23.880]  and heavy metals. It's a documented fact. 80% of all Americans and 85% of people around
[1:20:23.880 --> 1:20:29.440]  the world suffer from internal parasites and parasitic infection. Now you can fight internal
[1:20:29.440 --> 1:20:35.000]  parasites, heavy metals and high cholesterol naturally and safely by mixing fossilized
[1:20:35.000 --> 1:20:40.520]  phytoplankton powder, also known as FPP with your favorite beverage once a day. FPP is
[1:20:40.520 --> 1:20:47.960]  now available to you from FreshwaterOrganics.com. A two-month supply starts at just $17. FPP
[1:20:47.960 --> 1:20:53.760]  is so affordable you can't afford to do without. Visit FreshwaterOrganics.com or call them

[1:21:01.760 --> 1:21:06.240]  Now from the makers of Loose Change, the most downloading film in internet history comes
[1:21:06.240 --> 1:21:12.480]  the long-awaited release of Loose Change Final Cut, an entirely new two-hour film that completely
[1:21:12.480 --> 1:21:17.200]  destroys the official fable forever. Loose Change Final Cut hopes to be a catalyst for
[1:21:17.200 --> 1:21:21.920]  a new independent investigation in which family members receive answers to their questions
[1:21:21.920 --> 1:21:26.440]  and the true perpetrators of the horrendous crime are brought to justice. Loose Change
[1:21:26.440 --> 1:21:31.920]  Final Cut is the ultimate 9-11 expose. From hijackers being trained at U.S. military bases
[1:21:31.920 --> 1:21:37.640]  to bombs in the buildings, Loose Change Final Cut is the one 9-11 film everyone must see.

[1:22:19.520 --> 1:22:22.880]  There has been talk coming from the Council of Foreign Relations of Forming an American
[1:22:22.880 --> 1:22:27.480]  Union Combining Canada, Mexico and the U.S. and Erasing Economic Borders. Bush met with
[1:22:27.480 --> 1:22:32.420]  Vincent Fox, President of Mexico, Paul Martin, Prime Minister of Canada, discussing a security
[1:22:32.420 --> 1:22:36.560]  and prosperity partnership. The formation of a North American Union will have a great
[1:22:36.560 --> 1:22:41.680]  impact on the U.S. economy. Jerome R. Corsi published the document, The Plan to Replace
[1:22:41.680 --> 1:22:47.200]  the Dollar with the Emerald. The sovereignty of the U.S. is under attack, and Corsi uncovers
[1:22:47.200 --> 1:22:53.960]  the secrets and lies that surround the deceit. Call for your copy today, 800-686-2237. We

[1:24:27.600 --> 1:24:36.560]  Kevin in Ohio, you're on the air worldwide, sir. I'm going to talk to you.
[1:24:36.560 --> 1:24:42.000]  Good afternoon. God bless you. And Alex, you have been doing an excellent job of being a
[1:24:42.000 --> 1:24:48.800]  patriot. Now, I'm a 91-year-old disabled decorated veteran of World War II who experienced two
[1:24:48.800 --> 1:24:55.680]  men killed with that in six feet of them in Germany. And I've been studying this decline
[1:24:55.680 --> 1:25:02.080]  in the U.S. for over 30 years. And I've spent about $50,000 and thousands of hours to keep
[1:25:02.080 --> 1:25:08.880]  the U.S. afloat. Now, in the White House, get this, we have a mole in control. All right,
[1:25:08.880 --> 1:25:18.320]  the Democrat sheep are following a traitorous shepherd, Obama, who is a puppet of the globalist
[1:25:18.320 --> 1:25:22.880]  who controlled the money and the media. Now, that's a combination. That's a powerhouse.
[1:25:22.880 --> 1:25:29.040]  But there's two words that will blow it right out of the water, the truth. Now,
[1:25:30.480 --> 1:25:36.080]  where you and I and groups like the John Birch Society have been putting the brakes on them.
[1:25:36.880 --> 1:25:44.000]  Example, we stopped the North American Union like they hit a brick wall. Now,
[1:25:44.880 --> 1:25:49.040]  let's just a little bit more. Among other things, the John Birch Society printed and
[1:25:49.040 --> 1:25:55.680]  distributed one million copies of a special issue of the New American Magazine, where they explained
[1:25:55.680 --> 1:26:03.200]  and exposed how the globalist plotted to combine Canada, United States, and Mexico with a common
[1:26:03.200 --> 1:26:12.160]  border and take away our borders with Canada and Mexico. And also, if that were to pass,
[1:26:12.160 --> 1:26:18.960]  we'd have lost our sovereignty similar to the European Union. And they already had a new money
[1:26:18.960 --> 1:26:24.960]  in mind, American, American dollar. And that's now, they try to do it by stealth. Now, the Wall
[1:26:24.960 --> 1:26:28.960]  Street Journal and countless other publications are admitting that they're setting it up, but they
[1:26:28.960 --> 1:26:33.840]  claim it's a new idea they just got. And that's the only way they can save the economy is this
[1:26:33.840 --> 1:26:39.120]  new bank of the world in the North American Union and the transatlantic merger of the European Union
[1:26:39.120 --> 1:26:44.080]  with the North American Union. It's all now being announced and our credibility has just
[1:26:44.080 --> 1:26:49.280]  absolutely exploded off the charts. And I want to agree with you, if it wasn't for the old timers
[1:26:49.280 --> 1:26:54.160]  like yourself, the last 50, 60 years fighting the globalist, we would have already completely
[1:26:54.160 --> 1:26:58.960]  fallen to this system. And that's what's so exciting, but also frustrating to know we have
[1:26:58.960 --> 1:27:04.080]  power, to know we can stop these people. While most folks sit on the bench sucking their thumb,
[1:27:04.080 --> 1:27:11.200]  saying no one can stop this tyranny, it's for, you know, gained by God, submit to it Romans 13,
[1:27:11.200 --> 1:27:14.720]  when that is paid for by the New World Order and directly out of the pit of hell.
[1:27:15.920 --> 1:27:21.680]  Here's another thing that's not covered very much. And immoral nation cannot long stand.
[1:27:22.560 --> 1:27:31.040]  And where are we today with all this immorality? And we made a place around a Hitler and killing
[1:27:31.040 --> 1:27:37.440]  a group of people. And I've written many letters to the editor and many of them are on pro-life.
[1:27:38.160 --> 1:27:47.600]  And the one I said, let's see, oh, what did I say? So long as Roby Wade is in place,
[1:27:47.600 --> 1:27:54.720]  we are on the slippery slope to oblivion. And here's something, a quote from Mother Teresa.
[1:27:54.720 --> 1:28:03.920]  Abortion is the biggest obstacle to world peace. So we have to be in, as a nation,
[1:28:03.920 --> 1:28:09.920]  become moral and as individuals. And when that happens, why God will heal our land.
[1:28:11.520 --> 1:28:15.760]  And you're doing a great job. Well, sir, God bless you. And it's good to hear from you.
[1:28:15.760 --> 1:28:20.560]  Absolutely. You know, if we've had 50 million abortions in this country, hundreds of millions
[1:28:20.560 --> 1:28:25.680]  worldwide, you know, that lie is so big that once people buy into that dehumanization,
[1:28:25.680 --> 1:28:29.600]  anything else is possible. And they say, oh, it's just some little stem cells we want that
[1:28:29.600 --> 1:28:34.480]  Obama's just announced they're going to legalize. Oh, it'll save all these people when, meanwhile,
[1:28:34.480 --> 1:28:41.120]  they can get the stem cells from skin tissue, breast tissue, anything. It works just as well.
[1:28:41.120 --> 1:28:46.640]  What they really want to do and what the legalization really does is allow them to engage
[1:28:46.640 --> 1:28:54.720]  in manipulation of embryos, of fetuses, of babies all over the world in South Korea
[1:28:54.720 --> 1:28:59.520]  and in England and other nations. It's on record that they have these cross species,
[1:29:00.480 --> 1:29:09.280]  part human, part animal, chimeras. And they have part pig, part human, part cow, part human.
[1:29:09.280 --> 1:29:12.960]  They, in many cases, they have the part bovine, part human, part cow, part human,
[1:29:12.960 --> 1:29:22.960]  so that they can implant humanoid slash bovine embryos in the uterus of the cows to grow the
[1:29:22.960 --> 1:29:28.240]  humanoid up to larger size for organ harvesting. This is all announced. So you hear, oh, it's just
[1:29:28.240 --> 1:29:38.480]  a little stem cell. No, it's a baby. And they want to use those as the blueprint seed to grow these
[1:29:38.480 --> 1:29:44.320]  abominations. Oh, but it's just babies. It's just embryos. Yeah, it's just old people that
[1:29:44.320 --> 1:29:48.800]  euthanize them. Oh, you know, the new health care plan says they're going to ration health care.
[1:29:48.800 --> 1:29:58.000]  It's dehumanization. We're on the march. The empire's on the run. Alex Jones and the GCN radio network.
[1:30:01.760 --> 1:30:06.240]  How many times have you been in the dark looking for a flashlight? Only to find the one that you
[1:30:06.240 --> 1:30:11.440]  have is broken. The batteries are dead or it's just not bright enough. You need the pack light.
[1:30:11.440 --> 1:30:16.640]  The pack light is the longest lasting flashlight on the market and simply snaps onto any nine volt
[1:30:16.640 --> 1:30:22.000]  battery and uses two high powered LED lights. It's small enough to carry in your pocket car,
[1:30:22.000 --> 1:30:27.120]  garage and home. The pack light can survive severe impact, be frozen solid and still work
[1:30:27.120 --> 1:30:31.520]  flawlessly. The pack light is so durable, soldiers overseas rely on them and has been
[1:30:31.520 --> 1:30:36.640]  featured in the New York Times and backpacker magazine. The pack light comes with a 25 year warranty
[1:30:36.640 --> 1:30:42.000]  and prices started just $12.99. To learn more and see for yourself just how incredible this
[1:30:42.000 --> 1:30:50.640]  small flashlight can be, visit ninevoltlight.com. That address again is ninevoltlight.com or call us

[1:31:04.000 --> 1:31:10.000]  history, a terrorist act of war against this country. The enemy struck America on September 11th.
[1:31:10.560 --> 1:31:15.760]  But who is the enemy? Bin Laden. This is his MO. We have to look to the Middle East. We have to look
[1:31:15.760 --> 1:31:21.040]  to Osama bin Laden. Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist
[1:31:21.040 --> 1:31:26.240]  ties to intelligence networks inside the United States. Some US investigators believe that there
[1:31:26.240 --> 1:31:33.120]  are Israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the US. I'm aware that some Israeli
[1:31:33.120 --> 1:31:38.800]  citizens have been detained. Bin Laden's connections to the CIA, the hijackers ties to the FBI,
[1:31:38.800 --> 1:31:43.040]  the Saudi Arabian connection, the Israeli intelligence network, warnings in war games,
[1:31:43.040 --> 1:31:48.720]  the shadow government, and much, much more. Fabled enemies. Get the DVD at infowars.com.

[1:32:27.920 --> 1:32:32.720]  than defending yourself and preventing the crime, don't call eFoodsDirect. If you believe the official
[1:32:32.720 --> 1:32:38.000]  report on 9-11, you won't need food. If you think the warnings on the Alex Jones show are foolish,
[1:32:38.000 --> 1:32:45.520]  don't call eFoodsDirect. For the rest of you, go to eFoodsDirect.com or call 800-409-5633.

[1:33:05.440 --> 1:33:11.920]  We are continuing with open phones. I have Representative Dennis Richardson,
[1:33:11.920 --> 1:33:16.320]  Oregon, who has introduced legislation to restore the 10th and 9th Amendment in their
[1:33:16.320 --> 1:33:20.240]  state against the feds joining us for about 15 minutes. Then we've got Greg Pound with
[1:33:20.240 --> 1:33:23.920]  how they're stanching people's children all over Florida for not taking vaccinations,
[1:33:23.920 --> 1:33:31.120]  even though there's no law. There's absolute criminal activity. By the globalist, that is coming up.
[1:33:33.360 --> 1:33:36.880]  Right now, though, we are continuing with your phone calls. I do want to take just a minute or
[1:33:36.880 --> 1:33:47.040]  so out to remind everybody, we are now five days away, five days away from the online release,
[1:33:47.600 --> 1:33:52.480]  five days away from the release of the Obama deception. You'll be able to watch it in super
[1:33:52.480 --> 1:33:57.040]  high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv. You'll be able to download it and burn it to disc. We're
[1:33:57.040 --> 1:34:02.240]  going to have a Divx version and a high quality Windows version up there built for activism.
[1:34:02.240 --> 1:34:06.480]  It looks almost as good as a regular DVD to just burn it to disc. Give it to everybody you
[1:34:06.480 --> 1:34:12.160]  know. You can, of course, preorder the high quality DVD with all the extras and everything on it
[1:34:12.160 --> 1:34:16.800]  at infowars.com to get that high quality hard copy, the perfect copy to make copies from to get
[1:34:16.800 --> 1:34:22.400]  out to people. It exposes the entire globalist agenda, who the banks are, who the New World Order
[1:34:22.400 --> 1:34:27.760]  are, how they control Bush, how Obama's continuing every policy, all of his lies, what his real agenda
[1:34:27.760 --> 1:34:33.440]  is, the work brigades, the FEMA camps, the youth brigades, the environmental brigades, keeping
[1:34:33.440 --> 1:34:40.720]  the FEMA camps open, expanding the FEMA camps. It's got Gerald Salente, Webster Tarpley, Jesse
[1:34:40.720 --> 1:34:51.200]  Ventura, Professor Griff, KRS-1, George Humphrey, myself, and it's just chop full of, you know,
[1:34:51.200 --> 1:34:57.600]  video clips. It just goes, it's just amazing. It really is, you know, making a film in three months,
[1:34:58.160 --> 1:35:02.800]  three and a half months counting some of the research, physically editing and shooting the
[1:35:02.800 --> 1:35:07.040]  whole thing in two months. Normally, that's about half the time I normally make a film in,
[1:35:07.040 --> 1:35:14.080]  but it turned out being as good as any of my films are better because we just burnt the candle at
[1:35:14.080 --> 1:35:20.720]  both ends here. Please preorder the Obama deception, and as the orders come in, that's the order
[1:35:20.720 --> 1:35:27.040]  that they'll be shipped out to everybody. We begin shipping with EVs out on March 15th,
[1:35:27.040 --> 1:35:34.480]  March 16th, that Monday, a mass of these will be mailed out, and the coming up this Sunday evening,
[1:35:36.480 --> 1:35:39.840]  coming up this Sunday evening, so technically I guess about six days from now,
[1:35:39.840 --> 1:35:46.800]  at 6 p.m. when the Sunday show ends at 6 o'clock central, that will be the premiere
[1:35:46.800 --> 1:35:50.240]  at Presidentplanet.tv. So start your engines.
[1:35:50.240 --> 1:35:57.520]  Also, over the last two months, we have been redesigning with the Web 2.0 design,
[1:35:58.480 --> 1:36:04.080]  prisonplanet.tv. Had an outside firm do this. The site has been done for about a week, but
[1:36:04.080 --> 1:36:09.680]  they're busy trying to migrate the thousands of videos and audio into the new format, where it's
[1:36:09.680 --> 1:36:14.320]  much easier to find everything. And then in phase two, we're going to add where you have your own
[1:36:14.320 --> 1:36:21.280]  MySpace subpage on it, and where you can comment on the videos, and just a bunch of other features
[1:36:21.280 --> 1:36:25.520]  where you can vote videos that you think are the best up to the main page.
[1:36:27.200 --> 1:36:31.040]  That's phase two. That'll be about a month from now. We may launch this in the next two to three
[1:36:31.040 --> 1:36:35.520]  days, or I may wait until after the release of the Obama deception to launch the new site,
[1:36:35.520 --> 1:36:39.840]  because there may be a few bugs with it, and I don't want to be working those out while everybody's
[1:36:39.840 --> 1:36:47.040]  on the site downloading and streaming. It's going to be flash streaming in the highest quality,
[1:36:47.040 --> 1:36:52.160]  several formats. It's going to be in, I don't know, like five different formats,
[1:36:52.160 --> 1:36:57.040]  including DivEx, prisonplanet.tv. If you don't have the 595 a month membership,
[1:36:57.040 --> 1:37:01.120]  595, one-time membership, you can go in there, download everything, burn at the disc, have a
[1:37:01.120 --> 1:37:05.840]  complete library of everything we've done the last five years. All the radio shows in the highest
[1:37:05.840 --> 1:37:12.160]  quality, weekly TV reports, in-studio reports, special extras, prisonplanet.tv, see the Obama
[1:37:12.160 --> 1:37:19.360]  deception coming up this Sunday, 6 p.m. Now, obviously, there's going to be a massive load,
[1:37:19.360 --> 1:37:25.760]  but we have, what, three CDNs now, which are made up of thousands of servers apiece,
[1:37:27.840 --> 1:37:33.120]  but I know folks have shared their passcodes to the site, so it puts a huge load on things.
[1:37:33.120 --> 1:37:37.440]  We've never had a problem with the slowdown since we went to CDNs about a year ago
[1:37:37.440 --> 1:37:43.200]  with prisonplanet.tv, but I'm not counting on that. So if you're going to have a viewing party
[1:37:43.200 --> 1:37:46.880]  Sunday night, it might be smart to wait until Monday, Tuesday, or Wednesday night to have a
[1:37:46.880 --> 1:37:51.280]  viewing party at your house. You can plug your computer right in to your big screen television
[1:37:51.280 --> 1:37:56.400]  set. It's that high a quality. It'll be like watching a DVD, or you can just burn a DivEx copy
[1:37:56.400 --> 1:38:01.280]  and put it in your DVD player and watch it that way. And I want everybody to have viewing parties
[1:38:01.280 --> 1:38:09.440]  for the Obama deception. I don't allow people, you know, because I'm a nice guy. I don't allow
[1:38:09.440 --> 1:38:16.160]  people to make copies of the films and share them. I beg you to. I ask you to. I want you to.
[1:38:16.160 --> 1:38:20.720]  It's not some favor I'm doing. We don't have any future if these people aren't exposed. You
[1:38:20.720 --> 1:38:27.040]  understand? I deal with life and death situations every single day. I live in the trenches watching
[1:38:27.040 --> 1:38:31.600]  them kidnap people's children and murder people. I live in the trenches constantly focused on their
[1:38:31.600 --> 1:38:36.720]  evil, constantly focused on learning more about how the enemy mind operates and how we can defeat
[1:38:36.720 --> 1:38:43.840]  them. So please don't tell me thank you, Alex for letting us make copies of this film. No, thank you.
[1:38:45.520 --> 1:38:52.320]  Thank you for making copies of the films. Thank you for making them go viral on the internet.
[1:38:52.320 --> 1:38:57.920]  Thank you for getting the information out. Thank you for all you do. We have a good chance of
[1:38:57.920 --> 1:39:02.640]  beating the globalist if we just believe we can and know historically we can and if we have the truth.
[1:39:05.520 --> 1:39:09.920]  So go to infowars.com to pre-order the DVD or get a prisonplanet.tv membership today. You just
[1:39:09.920 --> 1:39:22.160]  got six days to wait or you can simply call toll three 888-253-3139-888-2533139. We have the
[1:39:22.160 --> 1:39:29.040]  Obama deception as low as $9.95 apiece. Well actually $8 apiece if you order them in bulk.
[1:39:29.040 --> 1:39:35.920]  So get your bulk orders in. Believe me, we can use the Obama hype machine to defeat the Obama
[1:39:35.920 --> 1:39:42.640]  hype machine. Obama trinkets of any type. I mean they're selling magazines about Obama for $18
[1:39:42.640 --> 1:39:47.520]  where they worship him and call him world leader and they're at all the stores. You, for bookstores
[1:39:47.520 --> 1:39:53.440]  or people that own convenience stores or the churches, whatever. You will sell all of these.
[1:39:54.080 --> 1:39:59.280]  People are smashing up anything Obama related. It's all propaganda and lies from his angle.
[1:40:00.080 --> 1:40:05.920]  This film is the truth. It is going to explode. It's already exploded. We have never had such
[1:40:05.920 --> 1:40:10.160]  interest. Not with in-game, not with loose change, final cut, not with terror storm, not with anything
[1:40:10.160 --> 1:40:19.600]  we've put out. This is ultra massive. So pre-order hundreds. Get them. Get them out to everybody you
[1:40:19.600 --> 1:40:24.960]  know. Sell them because then that will fund your operation and continue to get more and more out.
[1:40:24.960 --> 1:40:29.520]  Or if you've got the money, buy one DVD of the Obama deception in super high quality.
[1:40:29.520 --> 1:40:35.920]  Buy a DVD burner and a bunch of DVD blanks and just it takes four or five minutes to make each one
[1:40:35.920 --> 1:40:41.440]  with most burners and just sit there an hour a night, make 10 or 15 copies and hand them out.
[1:40:41.440 --> 1:40:47.360]  People say, hey, a wicked film about Obama. Tell me what you think about this and you will
[1:40:47.360 --> 1:40:52.240]  deprogram somebody and they will get angry once they realize they've been lied to. And this is
[1:40:52.240 --> 1:40:56.480]  how we fight the enemy. So the Obama deception, ladies and gentlemen, we've had a lot of dirty
[1:40:56.480 --> 1:41:01.600]  tricks going against us due to this film, which is very encouraging. That's excellent news.
[1:41:01.600 --> 1:41:06.800]  We thank God for those blessings and it is just having a massive effect already.
[1:41:10.080 --> 1:41:18.080]  There will be a new trailer coming out Thursday morning at prisonplanet.com and infowars.com.
[1:41:18.080 --> 1:41:22.320]  There's been one trailer before. This will be the official trailer. It'll be about two minutes long.
[1:41:22.880 --> 1:41:27.280]  We're going to have a couple sneak peeks that are released on Thursday as well. And then I'm going
[1:41:27.280 --> 1:41:33.360]  to do a video press release interview today covering the film, a 10 minute piece we're going to be
[1:41:33.360 --> 1:41:40.400]  posting on Friday at infowars.com and prisonplanet.com. We ask everybody to spread that to the
[1:41:40.400 --> 1:41:49.040]  forewinds where we break down the film as well. Okay, let's go to your calls as quickly as possible
[1:41:49.040 --> 1:41:58.080]  now. John in New York, John, you're on the air. I just want to say I'm a huge fan of the show and
[1:41:58.080 --> 1:42:03.680]  I just want to thank you for doing what you've been doing to wake America up. I just wanted to
[1:42:03.680 --> 1:42:09.600]  ask you real quick what you think about the role that Zionism and the state of Israel is playing
[1:42:09.600 --> 1:42:15.920]  this in this whole new world order. Obviously, APEC wields great power in shaping our foreign
[1:42:15.920 --> 1:42:22.240]  policy towards the Middle East and Israel profits greatly from America fighting against the Middle
[1:42:22.240 --> 1:42:27.360]  East and all these wars. So I was just curious on what you thought about all that. I mean,
[1:42:27.360 --> 1:42:33.360]  and obviously we know Israel attacked the USS Liberty according to some survivors and they've
[1:42:33.360 --> 1:42:39.120]  come out about that. So I'm just curious on what you think about the whole Zionism thing in Israel.
[1:42:39.120 --> 1:42:42.080]  Well, I mean, we've covered this at Nauseum. How long have you been a listener?
[1:42:42.080 --> 1:42:47.040]  For a couple of months now. Okay, well, let me comment on that and I appreciate your call.
[1:42:49.440 --> 1:42:54.800]  I want to have a frequently asked questions area up on the websites so that we can just,
[1:42:54.800 --> 1:42:59.760]  I guess, have a video clip there where I explain my view and where I stand on all this. Number one,
[1:42:59.760 --> 1:43:06.160]  sir, if you want the full story on what happened to the USS Liberty, my film Terror Storm.
[1:43:07.840 --> 1:43:11.120]  And I've interviewed the admirals, the former chairman, John Jesus staff,
[1:43:11.120 --> 1:43:14.240]  the people that were on board the ship, the doctor, the first mate,
[1:43:16.240 --> 1:43:23.040]  and now it's been declassified. The Chicago Tribune reported early last year
[1:43:24.960 --> 1:43:33.040]  that the NSA released the encoded recordings where the Israeli fighter pilots were saying what
[1:43:33.040 --> 1:43:36.080]  they'd already testified to. The pilots separately have been in the Israeli press
[1:43:36.080 --> 1:43:40.880]  saying that they were ordered three times. They said that's an American flag. It's an American ship.
[1:43:41.440 --> 1:43:44.960]  Why are we going to attack it? They were ordered, you will attack that now or you're going to be
[1:43:44.960 --> 1:43:50.720]  court-martialed. The leader of the squadron, you know, was told a second time to do it and he said,
[1:43:50.720 --> 1:43:54.240]  no, again. And the third time they came back and they said, you are going to be court-martialed,
[1:43:54.240 --> 1:43:59.040]  attack. And the leader of the squadron went public with that about a decade ago.
[1:43:59.040 --> 1:44:08.560]  But now the NSA has declassified the transcripts of the listening stations that did pick up
[1:44:08.560 --> 1:44:14.640]  and were recording everything that was being said, everything that was going on,
[1:44:14.640 --> 1:44:19.200]  everything that was happening. And what happened is Israel wanted to sink the ship
[1:44:19.200 --> 1:44:23.440]  to blame it on Egypt to widen the war. That's just a fact and it's on record.
[1:44:23.440 --> 1:44:27.360]  They tried to write all these books denying it, but it's come out that it's true.
[1:44:27.360 --> 1:44:33.760]  Now, the next thing I'm going to say doesn't lessen Israel's burden in what they did. Some
[1:44:33.760 --> 1:44:38.640]  people tried to spin it and claim that I'm defending Israel, which I didn't do. I put it
[1:44:38.640 --> 1:44:45.360]  in my film, What the Admirals, What the Captains, What the Judge Advocate General, Captain Thomas
[1:44:45.360 --> 1:44:49.280]  Moore said on this show, the interviews are all out there on the web, dozens of interviews,
[1:44:49.280 --> 1:44:52.720]  probably then 30, 40 interviews with survivors, probably more than that over the years.
[1:44:52.720 --> 1:44:59.280]  And that is that LBJ, because people say, what do you mean LBJ was in control of the ship?
[1:45:00.480 --> 1:45:05.920]  Presidents aren't in control of ships. Yes, they are. The USS Liberty was the most advanced spy
[1:45:05.920 --> 1:45:11.120]  ship in the Navy's arsenal at the time. And it was there spying on what Israel was doing
[1:45:11.120 --> 1:45:17.600]  and on massacres going on in the Sinai at the time being carried out by then General Ariel
[1:45:17.600 --> 1:45:24.000]  Sharon. And they were there recording everything that was happening during the Six Day War.
[1:45:28.960 --> 1:45:32.400]  And when the ship came under attack for over two and a half hours, within minutes,
[1:45:32.960 --> 1:45:37.840]  an aircraft task force about 150 miles away launched fighter bombers to go defend the ship.
[1:45:38.640 --> 1:45:44.480]  And we've interviewed the Admirals, Admiral Geist and others years ago. Most of these guys
[1:45:44.480 --> 1:45:47.920]  have now died, but the interviews are there for everybody to go see. Admiral Moore is dead now,
[1:45:47.920 --> 1:45:51.520]  died in 2004. We interviewed him months before he died, one of many interviews we did with him.
[1:45:53.440 --> 1:46:01.680]  They launched fighter bombers off the aircraft carriers and then McNamara came on and said,
[1:46:01.680 --> 1:46:05.920]  turn those planes around because the National Security Council was in direct control of the
[1:46:05.920 --> 1:46:12.080]  operation. So over the radio phone on the bridge, and they all heard it on multiple aircraft carriers
[1:46:12.080 --> 1:46:18.320]  and the witnesses are all on record, he said, turn those planes around, stand down, and don't
[1:46:18.320 --> 1:46:23.760]  respond to the ship. There's the Israeli fighter bombers, the Dessant missaries, the Mirage fighters,
[1:46:25.280 --> 1:46:30.240]  the torpedo boats of 50 calibers and torpedoes blasted off the mass, blasted off the communications.
[1:46:31.360 --> 1:46:34.480]  The radio man had climbed out even though he was burned on the deck
[1:46:35.760 --> 1:46:41.120]  with napalm and white phosphorus burning, literally melting through his shoes and burning his feet
[1:46:41.120 --> 1:46:46.640]  to rig a ham radio emergency rig to keep calling out for help. The ships were told, don't respond
[1:46:46.640 --> 1:46:50.960]  to them as they're saying, we're under attack, we're under attack, help us, help us. And it went
[1:46:50.960 --> 1:46:59.760]  on and on for hour after hour. And Admiral Geiss said, no, I am, you know, that's an illegal order,
[1:47:00.720 --> 1:47:06.640]  respectfully, Secretary of Defense McNamara, I am giving aid to our ship. But you know,
[1:47:06.640 --> 1:47:10.400]  they've sent out distress signals, they're under attack, the jets are about to be there. And he
[1:47:10.400 --> 1:47:14.240]  said, you are going to be court-martialed if you don't turn those jets back. And he said, I don't care.
[1:47:15.920 --> 1:47:20.880]  And then President Johnson came on the line and he said, you listen to me and you listen good.
[1:47:20.880 --> 1:47:23.120]  I want that GD ship to go to the bottom.
[1:47:25.920 --> 1:47:30.000]  And he said, yes, sir, president. And they turned those jets back. But those men,
[1:47:30.000 --> 1:47:35.760]  the most highly decorated ship in US history, kept that ship afloat and kept that ship up.
[1:47:35.760 --> 1:47:43.680]  And so it didn't sink. And then a Russian intelligence ship came up as Israeli commando
[1:47:43.680 --> 1:47:50.640]  helicopters were coming in armed with riot guns to go, go aboard. The ship was preparing to repulse
[1:47:50.640 --> 1:47:56.080]  that attack. And the Russian ship began speeding in to stop them. And the Israelis peeled off
[1:47:56.080 --> 1:48:00.720]  because the Russians were going to their battle stations preparing to attack the helicopters
[1:48:00.720 --> 1:48:07.200]  in the defense of the US crippled ship, which is just the only thing they could do. And so the
[1:48:07.200 --> 1:48:13.840]  Israelis were not about to attack the Russians. So they had a whole bunch of helicopters about
[1:48:13.840 --> 1:48:22.880]  to go down on that deck and sink that ship to blame it on Egypt. And it's just horrible. And we
[1:48:22.880 --> 1:48:29.680]  have to tell the facts here. Now, you know, that said, polarizing issues, it doesn't matter if you
[1:48:29.680 --> 1:48:34.320]  are Jewish or if you're Catholic or if you're a Protestant or if you're a Muslim, none of us
[1:48:34.320 --> 1:48:38.320]  should want to take cancer filled vaccine shots. None of us should want to be part of the eugenics
[1:48:38.320 --> 1:48:44.800]  New World Order. None of us should want to be part of this. And Israel was established over there
[1:48:44.800 --> 1:48:50.240]  so that it could be a military outpost of the Anglo American Empire. The Rothschilds publicly
[1:48:50.240 --> 1:48:57.520]  funded it being set up. Israel has all these nuclear weapons. And clearly it's destabilizing the entire
[1:48:57.520 --> 1:49:05.520]  region. And it is probably going to end up someday causing World War Three. So that's the bottom line
[1:49:05.520 --> 1:49:11.920]  of what we're dealing with with Israel. And it's just a nightmare situation. Now, the fact that
[1:49:11.920 --> 1:49:17.680]  LBJ was involved in all of this, that's what the captains and the generals and the judge advocate
[1:49:17.680 --> 1:49:21.920]  officers who were ordered to cover it up and we've had them on have gone public. By the way,
[1:49:21.920 --> 1:49:27.440]  is Captain Moore, Larry became Admiral Moore? Is he still alive? I know he was real sick last time
[1:49:27.440 --> 1:49:32.160]  we called him a year or so ago to come on with heart problems. Or was it two years ago? These
[1:49:32.160 --> 1:49:38.320]  guys are all dying. Maybe we should get Admiral at the time Captain Moore back on because they
[1:49:38.320 --> 1:49:43.040]  were ordered in London to cover it up for the Navy. And they did just that. I mean, we've got the
[1:49:43.040 --> 1:49:48.960]  guys that ordered to cover it up coming out. But the fact that LBJ was involved shows the
[1:49:48.960 --> 1:49:56.720]  premeditation between the White House and Israel to carry out this dirty deed. And by the way,
[1:49:56.720 --> 1:50:05.120]  Heritz and Jerusalem Post admit you can just Google so does UPI Israel stages bombings or you
[1:50:05.120 --> 1:50:10.880]  can Google Israel created fake al-Qaeda. Now, there are some real terror attacks in Israel.
[1:50:11.760 --> 1:50:15.200]  But that's, you know, when a woman goes on a bus and stabs 14 people or somebody goes in and
[1:50:15.200 --> 1:50:19.920]  shoots people in the crowd, most of these bombings where they, oh, it was a suicide bomber. It's
[1:50:19.920 --> 1:50:24.400]  actually a bomb placed in the buses or in the nightclubs. It blows up and then they just say
[1:50:24.400 --> 1:50:39.440]  that there was a suicide bomber. Okay, so Thomas Moore is dead. He was pointing out something.
[1:50:39.440 --> 1:50:43.600]  Well, that's too bad. No, no, no, yeah, that's
[1:50:46.240 --> 1:50:49.840]  Admiral Moore. There's another Moore. No, I know he died in 2004.
[1:50:52.000 --> 1:50:56.560]  I don't know all the names of these people. The point is you can do Alex Jones, USS Liberty

[1:54:25.040 --> 1:54:34.240]  You know, I don't know how to describe the overwhelmingness of it all. I mean to know
[1:54:34.240 --> 1:54:39.840]  that the globalists put HIV and hepatitis in different vaccines and products and have been
[1:54:39.840 --> 1:54:44.640]  caught thousands of times in its mainstream news. You could hold up a mainstream news article where
[1:54:44.640 --> 1:54:50.320]  they admit it's happening and they still call you a conspiracy theorist. Or where the HPV shot in
[1:54:50.320 --> 1:54:55.360]  the trials killed people. Now it's killing people en masse and still people just inject their girls
[1:54:55.360 --> 1:55:00.000]  with it. Now they're going to try to force boys to have it. To know that the New World Order stage
[1:55:00.000 --> 1:55:04.080]  is terror attacks. To know they control every dominant nation on earth. To know they're bringing
[1:55:04.080 --> 1:55:09.120]  in a world government. I mean it's so outrageously criminal to have the banks engineering the
[1:55:09.120 --> 1:55:14.240]  financial collapse in their own documents and then be openly announcing world government
[1:55:14.240 --> 1:55:22.080]  as the answer to stop it all. And then I've got to sit up here and beg and plead with the public
[1:55:22.080 --> 1:55:30.720]  to wake up and look at the facts. I mean it's ridiculous. It's like somebody's house is on fire
[1:55:30.720 --> 1:55:34.400]  and you come up and say, hey buddy your house is on fire and they laugh at you and walk back into
[1:55:34.400 --> 1:55:42.000]  the flames and burst into flame. And it's almost like just coming on the air and calmly talking
[1:55:42.000 --> 1:55:46.800]  about all this in a way almost just conditions people and acclimates. It's sick. I don't even
[1:55:46.800 --> 1:55:52.560]  know what to do anymore. And you know I get all these groups and people hating me from all different
[1:55:52.560 --> 1:55:57.440]  sides in many cases just because I report the facts and the truth of what's admitted.
[1:56:01.040 --> 1:56:09.920]  Of what is on record over and over and over and over and over again. We've got a bunch of
[1:56:09.920 --> 1:56:18.400]  psychopathic control freaks that are in control of our society and people are in denial. Oh,
[1:56:18.400 --> 1:56:23.760]  there's no bad people. They're not planning anything bad. Look at history. 99.9% of the time
[1:56:23.760 --> 1:56:30.640]  you get lunatics who think they're God in control that run around murdering people in mass so they
[1:56:30.640 --> 1:56:36.880]  can be the momentary rulers of this little speck of dust in the universe. And then human potential
[1:56:36.880 --> 1:56:40.800]  is so great. We could do so many great things. The elite claim they are doing all this for our
[1:56:40.800 --> 1:56:46.400]  own good when in truth they foster weakness. They foster degeneracy. They foster the dumbing down
[1:56:46.400 --> 1:56:52.240]  so we're more easily managed in control. And you know that is a great crime against humanity.
[1:56:52.240 --> 1:56:58.160]  It's just horrible. Evil people want power so they take over all the power positions and meanwhile
[1:56:58.160 --> 1:57:03.760]  good people are naive and judge the world by the way they think and think everybody else is like
[1:57:03.760 --> 1:57:08.960]  them and that's the biggest trick of these globalists. I know we got Frank, Sherry, Bob, Mike,
[1:57:08.960 --> 1:57:15.200]  Dan and others and we'll get to your calls. I want to first get into an analysis of the Watchman
[1:57:16.560 --> 1:57:22.560]  or Watchman. I keep calling it the Watchman. It's Watchman comic because it's the big number
[1:57:22.560 --> 1:57:29.920]  one film right now online to break records for the amount of money that a film has made.
[1:57:29.920 --> 1:57:35.760]  And you know I'm accustomed to Illuminati, New World Order, Revelation of the Method, programming
[1:57:36.720 --> 1:57:42.320]  on news and in TV and in popular culture but this thing just completely blew me away. I mean
[1:57:42.320 --> 1:57:48.320]  I've never seen anything like it and there's no way I can even do justice to it. Meanwhile even
[1:57:48.320 --> 1:57:53.760]  Patriots are saying oh it's a good film and admits things or oh you know this is good
[1:57:53.760 --> 1:58:00.320]  or the mainstream media saying what's the film mean? It's like they can't even look at a stop sign
[1:58:01.440 --> 1:58:07.840]  and tell what it means. It's all stated in clear English. It is a threatening,
[1:58:07.840 --> 1:58:11.360]  menacing message from the New World Order.
[1:58:11.360 --> 1:58:20.720]  So that's coming up when we go live at prisonplanet.tv here in a little while.
[1:58:24.080 --> 1:58:29.040]  I just have more sorrow than anything else because I wish if the public knew what I knew
[1:58:29.040 --> 1:58:32.320]  and knew how real this was there's no way the Globals would get away with this but
[1:58:32.320 --> 1:58:36.240]  people are so cowardly they rationalize and make excuses about things and that's why
[1:58:36.240 --> 1:58:40.400]  most of us are going to be murdered.
[1:59:07.200 --> 1:59:11.200]  In any emergency if you simply prepare no one is going to take care of your family
[1:59:11.200 --> 1:59:15.120]  in the final equation but you. You know eFoodsDirect.com is still able to shift

[1:59:48.880 --> 1:59:59.040]  Waging war on corruption. Alex Jones on the GCN radio network.
[2:00:05.680 --> 2:00:13.040]  Big brother. Mainstream media. Government cover-ups. You want answers? Well so does he.
[2:00:13.040 --> 2:00:21.920]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas, Alex Jones.
[2:00:30.400 --> 2:00:33.760]  Coming up in 15 minutes I'm going to start my review of the Watchman
[2:00:34.960 --> 2:00:41.280]  comic. Total New World Order propaganda in your face. We'll continue with open phones as well
[2:00:41.280 --> 2:00:45.520]  and get into some of the other news. They're talking about Bernie Madoff may not even spend
[2:00:45.520 --> 2:00:50.560]  any time in jail. Yeah still you know tens of billions of dollars no problem they protect their own.
[2:00:52.080 --> 2:00:56.240]  Also another report here up on prisonplanet.com your hard-earned money is being shipped to
[2:00:56.240 --> 2:00:59.440]  France Germany and China that's where the majority of the money's going. They've also
[2:00:59.440 --> 2:01:04.160]  stolen 250 billion dollars of the bailout money to go to the Cayman Islands. It's the very banks
[2:01:04.160 --> 2:01:10.000]  running the White House that are doing this. Also they're announcing they're going to use
[2:01:10.000 --> 2:01:15.200]  the military against the domestic front against the Canadian people. That's out of the national
[2:01:15.200 --> 2:01:20.880]  post of Canada. Another headline military may patrol bar zone in Canada so just getting everybody
[2:01:20.880 --> 2:01:25.840]  ready for that that's out of the Toronto Starb. New York Times says mileage tax would track
[2:01:25.840 --> 2:01:31.920]  motorists wherever they go. They're doing a 10 state grouping for a new CO2 carbon tax one of
[2:01:31.920 --> 2:01:41.440]  hundreds. New York Times sells its building leases it back just to stay afloat. That's all coming
[2:01:41.440 --> 2:01:46.880]  up ladies and gentlemen but for this segment and part of the next I wanted to bring him up because
[2:01:46.880 --> 2:01:52.240]  we've had a lot of questions from listeners about this system. I had an independent film channel
[2:01:52.240 --> 2:01:57.600]  crew here week and a half ago they're going to be back later this week another IFC film crew
[2:01:57.600 --> 2:02:04.480]  they're doing three pieces on me pretty weird but three pieces is what's weird and they're
[2:02:04.480 --> 2:02:10.240]  actually positive pieces it's very mind-boggling never seen fair mainstream media pieces but
[2:02:10.240 --> 2:02:14.240]  I've seen the new order film coming out that they've made it's actually fair but side issue
[2:02:15.600 --> 2:02:21.200]  I had them here and they were in the in the break room by the refrigerator and stuff and they said
[2:02:21.200 --> 2:02:25.600]  what is this? I said you know they wanted some water and they said it's a water machine it's not
[2:02:25.600 --> 2:02:30.320]  hooked up to the wall and I said no it's out away from the wall so it can suck in air and humidity
[2:02:30.320 --> 2:02:33.840]  and I said no there's no water bottle and they said there's there's water in the air
[2:02:34.400 --> 2:02:37.920]  I said yeah what do you think clouds are what do you think when it's cold outside and you breathe
[2:02:37.920 --> 2:02:44.000]  you see what looks like smoke that's water vapor condensation because it's warm and it's it's
[2:02:44.000 --> 2:02:48.160]  hitting the air it's a cloud it's like fog and they drank the water so that's the best thing I've
[2:02:48.160 --> 2:02:53.200]  ever tasted so I want to explain to listeners I've gotten emails by some people who can't I've
[2:02:53.200 --> 2:02:58.320]  seen YouTube videos when I've talked about it people have posted and they they go well that's
[2:02:58.320 --> 2:03:01.920]  impossible water out of the air I mean our listeners understand it but some people don't
[2:03:02.640 --> 2:03:07.520]  yes folks it's atmospheric water no fluoride no nothing goes through seven filters so I wanted to
[2:03:07.520 --> 2:03:14.720]  have Tyler Palmer the founder of the company and a guy that designed this unit it's the best
[2:03:14.720 --> 2:03:20.400]  atmospheric system we found Tyler great to have you on with us well thanks Alex thanks for having
[2:03:20.400 --> 2:03:26.800]  me on again and hello to all the listeners I mean we're about to break but just explain to people
[2:03:26.800 --> 2:03:36.400]  that yes you really can grab water out of the air yes well it seems like magic but actually it's
[2:03:36.400 --> 2:03:45.040]  very simple very basic atmospheric physics and anytime you see beads of water on your glass
[2:03:45.040 --> 2:03:51.840]  on a hot day that is the basis of the principle of atmospheric water generation there's humidity
[2:03:52.400 --> 2:03:58.960]  in the air water vapor in the air that's sitting there untapped and condensed and along we come
[2:03:58.960 --> 2:04:06.080]  with the echoloblu system and we condense that moisture and filter it seven times and make
[2:04:06.080 --> 2:04:14.320]  outstanding drinking water that you control well you certainly do that and you know there's ways
[2:04:14.320 --> 2:04:19.120]  for folks to primitively do this with about three hundred four dollars worth of equipment the difference
[2:04:19.120 --> 2:04:24.960]  is this goes through reverse osmosis and then six other filters it has hot and cold it has a
[2:04:24.960 --> 2:04:30.160]  computer with a great led area that shows you how much water shows you the humidity in the air
[2:04:30.720 --> 2:04:38.080]  it's just an amazing amazing unit yeah it certainly is and and I would caution people I get uh
[2:04:38.080 --> 2:04:44.880]  comments all the time about well this is just a dehumidifier and I say well actually it's 33
[2:04:44.880 --> 2:04:54.560]  and a third dehumidifier and and 66 percent water filter yeah stay there stay there yeah it's a high
[2:04:54.560 --> 2:05:03.920]  tech seven water filter system stay with us Alex Jones here with a question what does humidity
[2:05:03.920 --> 2:05:08.960]  mean to you most people think of hot and sticky summer days but many people are beginning to
[2:05:08.960 --> 2:05:14.080]  realize that humidity can be a valuable source of pure drinking water that's why I'd like you to visit

[2:08:45.360 --> 2:08:52.400]  water distilled water is what is basically water that boiled so it's water in its liquid state it
[2:08:52.400 --> 2:08:59.840]  becomes a gas and then it's condensed and uh laboratories and scientists the need distilled
[2:08:59.840 --> 2:09:05.680]  water to make uh whatever it is they're making because they need to make sure that what's in
[2:09:05.680 --> 2:09:14.160]  the water is h2o and h2o only and that it has a ph that's neutral so about seven uh ph of seven
[2:09:14.960 --> 2:09:22.480]  um so what we're doing is we're taking the moisture that's in the air around you and
[2:09:22.480 --> 2:09:29.520]  condensing it uh so we're sort of skipping the boiling uh step we're letting nature uh do that
[2:09:29.520 --> 2:09:38.240]  for us and uh we uh filter the water so many times through carbon filters through reverse
[2:09:38.240 --> 2:09:47.520]  osmosis and then through 245 nanometer uv light and it just sterilizes everything and as you know
[2:09:47.520 --> 2:09:54.720]  it produces wonderful uh water that tastes um like nothing you've ever tasted before
[2:09:54.720 --> 2:10:02.400]  with a neutral ph and so this is not just a uh dehumidifier then some people email me saying
[2:10:02.400 --> 2:10:07.760]  but this water doesn't have good humidity it's dehumidified no no no it's using a dehumidifier
[2:10:07.760 --> 2:10:13.280]  to grab the water out of the air it's pure water and then it's run through the filters and it has
[2:10:13.280 --> 2:10:19.120]  a neutral ph which all the study shows very very good for your body and actually has a cleansing
[2:10:19.120 --> 2:10:25.760]  effect just like distilled water uh has a cleansing effect and takes out many impurities uh from your
[2:10:25.760 --> 2:10:31.760]  body uh most people out there have never truly had pure water even the bottled water is normally
[2:10:31.760 --> 2:10:36.160]  taken out of municipal systems and they just take the bad taste out uh with carbon systems even
[2:10:36.160 --> 2:10:41.200]  reverse osmosis if it's from tap water doesn't remove but about 90 percent which is better than
[2:10:41.200 --> 2:10:46.880]  nothing uh of the fluoride but this is out of the air with no fluoride and then it goes through
[2:10:46.880 --> 2:10:51.600]  the filtration system just absolutely amazing the seven and a half gallons a day in regular
[2:10:51.600 --> 2:10:56.240]  humidity here in my office it's only about 25 percent humidity but it still produces about two
[2:10:56.240 --> 2:11:03.680]  gallons uh or more a day and that's what we uh uh use here at the office again just an amazing
[2:11:03.680 --> 2:11:08.240]  system it looks like a water cooler without the water bottle yeah on top of it it comes in a
[2:11:08.240 --> 2:11:14.480]  whole bunch of different great colors go online to a cola blue dot com or you can simply go to
[2:11:14.480 --> 2:11:18.720]  info wars dot com or prison planet dot com there's big banners everywhere they're at the top of the
[2:11:18.720 --> 2:11:28.480]  page ec olo blue dot com a cola blue dot com uh and tell folks about how they can get it well
[2:11:28.480 --> 2:11:34.800]  they if they could what we're going to do today is we have a special uh for the first 100 people
[2:11:34.800 --> 2:11:42.880]  who buy the machine we're going to have a hundred dollars off and uh that will be uh beginning
[2:11:42.880 --> 2:11:53.280]  soon as this interview is over and uh just call 800-691-6043 and you can talk to any of our sales
[2:11:53.280 --> 2:12:02.400]  reps and and uh they'll get you set up or you can go on to our website at www dot ec olo
[2:12:02.400 --> 2:12:10.320]  blue dot com and there's a link there to uh shopping and and just click on that and you
[2:12:10.320 --> 2:12:17.440]  can buy one right now and we'll send it out and uh you get it in about two to three weeks and it's
[2:12:18.400 --> 2:12:25.280]  relatively easy to set up once you get it there's not a lot of uh assembly you have to put the
[2:12:25.280 --> 2:12:32.240]  reverse osmosis filter in and that's about it absolutely and then what about maintenance of
[2:12:32.240 --> 2:12:38.480]  the unit that's that's easy as well yeah um the main the filters uh a lot of people
[2:12:38.480 --> 2:12:45.040]  sort of think that what we're doing is like a model of other water filter companies that uh
[2:12:46.240 --> 2:12:52.720]  they sell you the machine sheet and then um charge a fortune for the filters uh anyone who
[2:12:52.720 --> 2:13:00.080]  goes on to our web store will see that our filters are way below uh what uh competitors would would
[2:13:00.080 --> 2:13:06.960]  charge and uh their high quality filters as well how many gallons until you've got to change the
[2:13:06.960 --> 2:13:13.920]  filters well there's uh one filter on there that's the activated carbon filter the first one that
[2:13:13.920 --> 2:13:24.240]  needs to be uh changed every six months um so that's with uh about you know 28 that's at full
[2:13:24.240 --> 2:13:31.120]  use so let's assume you're using 28 gallons of water uh in a 24 hour period or 28 liters of
[2:13:31.120 --> 2:13:37.280]  water in a 24 hour period so uh i'm like you a public school educated so i can't do the math
[2:13:37.280 --> 2:13:41.120]  uh off the top of my head yeah but most people aren't even going to use it that much and then
[2:13:41.120 --> 2:13:45.360]  a few of the other filters have to be replaced from time to time very easy to do just pops in
[2:13:45.360 --> 2:13:49.920]  the bottom there uh give folks the toll free number again to call and find out more about the
[2:13:49.920 --> 2:14:01.280]  color blue it's uh 1-800-691-6043 and i'd like to add uh some of our canadian listeners have had

[2:15:23.360 --> 2:15:34.400]  okay we are live at prisonplanet.tv simulcasting with the live radio show now for the balance
[2:15:34.400 --> 2:15:39.520]  of the last hour and 45 minutes of this four-hour radio show we do monday through friday from 11 a.m to
[2:15:39.520 --> 2:15:47.280]  3 p.m central standard time i'm now going to do my review of the film watchman now let's be clear here
[2:15:47.280 --> 2:15:55.040]  i'm not a big comic fan because i've always been more serious studying history and government
[2:15:55.040 --> 2:16:01.760]  documents and the way the world actually works but art mimics life life image uh and of course
[2:16:01.760 --> 2:16:08.960]  mimics art itself so that goes vice versa i did go see the movie saturday night because
[2:16:08.960 --> 2:16:15.760]  listeners kept telling me i had to see it uh then on sunday i bought the watchman novel itself and
[2:16:15.760 --> 2:16:22.160]  scanned through it and it's very very similar to the film itself i've done some basic research
[2:16:22.160 --> 2:16:28.480]  on the creator of watchman alan more who is a mason and into all of this illuminati
[2:16:29.120 --> 2:16:35.680]  type stuff but if you look on the cover of the novel itself uh you see
[2:16:37.600 --> 2:16:45.280]  ozzy mandamus the leader of the superheroes the quote smartest man in the world and he has the
[2:16:45.280 --> 2:16:51.920]  all-seeing eye of horus on his breastplate you can see him right there on the uh
[2:16:54.800 --> 2:17:00.800]  right there on the left i guess for those watching on tv it's on your right and you
[2:17:00.800 --> 2:17:06.000]  can see the all-seeing eye of horus or lucifer there on his breastplate uh up at the top you
[2:17:06.000 --> 2:17:12.240]  can see the blue man who is floating and that's dr manhattan who is the only person that actually
[2:17:12.240 --> 2:17:21.360]  has real superpowers and he is a godlike creature and so i want to do a basic breakdown of this film
[2:17:21.360 --> 2:17:28.160]  it is an illuminati new world war threat all of humanity it is the psychopaths love to let the
[2:17:28.160 --> 2:17:32.960]  public know what they're planning what they're doing they believe that it gives them magical powers
[2:17:32.960 --> 2:17:38.080]  they call it lesser magic to to advertise what they're doing and how they operate to the public
[2:17:38.080 --> 2:17:44.160]  in all fairness to ellen more he did not want to be involved in the film because they changed some
[2:17:44.160 --> 2:17:50.480]  of the things that are in his official comic written back in the 1980s but he himself again
[2:17:50.480 --> 2:17:58.800]  is an admitted mason and promotes the whole illuminati ideology and they reveal much of their
[2:17:58.800 --> 2:18:04.560]  mindset and their system and what they believe in in the film so let's go ahead and go to part
[2:18:04.560 --> 2:18:20.480]  of the trailer official trailer for the watchman film
[2:18:34.560 --> 2:18:50.480]  and
[2:18:50.480 --> 2:18:55.480]  The world is lost and blown
[2:18:55.480 --> 2:19:02.480]  And we are flesh and blood, us and our own brain
[2:19:03.480 --> 2:19:07.480]  In your darkest hour
[2:19:07.480 --> 2:19:11.480]  And our own secrets laid
[2:19:11.480 --> 2:19:15.480]  We can't watch the world is now
[2:19:15.480 --> 2:19:21.480]  God help us all
[2:19:21.480 --> 2:19:31.480]  God help us all
[2:19:42.480 --> 2:19:45.480]  The world will look up and shout and save us
[2:19:46.480 --> 2:19:49.480]  And I'll whisper, No
[2:19:49.480 --> 2:19:54.480]  We're gonna come back and finish up with this after the quick break
[2:19:54.480 --> 2:19:58.480]  And then I will break down this in your face Illuminati
[2:19:58.480 --> 2:20:00.480]  Piece of work, stay with us
[2:20:01.480 --> 2:20:04.480]  You worry, you see the signs and worry about the future
[2:20:04.480 --> 2:20:07.480]  You worry about economic turmoil and food shortages
[2:20:07.480 --> 2:20:09.480]  How to be prepared while preserving your sanity
[2:20:09.480 --> 2:20:11.480]  Your answer may be at hand
[2:20:11.480 --> 2:20:14.480]  Author Linda Runyon lived off the land, isolated from civilization
[2:20:14.480 --> 2:20:16.480]  She knows that as long as the sun shines
[2:20:16.480 --> 2:20:19.480]  There will be plenty of free food all over God's green earth
[2:20:19.480 --> 2:20:23.480]  Perhaps the only sane insurance is knowledge of wild edible plants
[2:20:23.480 --> 2:20:25.480]  The cost of learning is minimal
[2:20:25.480 --> 2:20:28.480]  Wild food grows everywhere and you will see it everywhere
[2:20:28.480 --> 2:20:31.480]  It's every bit organic and more nutritious than our modern diets

[2:21:00.480 --> 2:21:04.480]  A day unlike any other in the long course of American history
[2:21:04.480 --> 2:21:07.480]  A terrorist act of war against this country
[2:21:07.480 --> 2:21:09.480]  The enemy struck America on September 11th
[2:21:09.480 --> 2:21:11.480]  But who is the enemy?
[2:21:11.480 --> 2:21:12.480]  Bin Laden
[2:21:12.480 --> 2:21:14.480]  This is his MO
[2:21:14.480 --> 2:21:17.480]  We have to look to the Middle East, we have to look to Osama Bin Laden
[2:21:17.480 --> 2:21:24.480]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside the United States
[2:21:24.480 --> 2:21:31.480]  Some U.S. investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S.
[2:21:31.480 --> 2:21:35.480]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained
[2:21:35.480 --> 2:21:45.480]  Bin Laden's connections to the CIA, the hijackers' ties to the FBI, the Saudi Arabian connection, the Israeli intelligence network, warnings in war games, the shadow government, and much, much more

[2:24:34.480 --> 2:24:36.480]  What their philosophy is?
[2:24:36.480 --> 2:24:39.480]  You see the watchman, you will know
[2:24:39.480 --> 2:24:42.480]  And doing more research on this film
[2:24:42.480 --> 2:24:44.480]  I noticed that most of the reviews say
[2:24:44.480 --> 2:24:47.480]  It's confusing, we don't understand the movie
[2:24:47.480 --> 2:24:49.480]  We don't understand the ending
[2:24:49.480 --> 2:24:51.480]  Well, you'd have to be a complete moron
[2:24:51.480 --> 2:24:53.480]  and not know how the world works and not understand it
[2:24:53.480 --> 2:24:59.480]  It's all about false flag terrorism and how good it is
[2:24:59.480 --> 2:25:01.480]  So we're gonna be breaking that down right now
[2:25:01.480 --> 2:25:03.480]  Let's finish up with the official trailer
[2:25:03.480 --> 2:25:05.480]  Just the tail end of it we were playing here
[2:25:05.480 --> 2:25:06.480]  Here it is
[2:25:06.480 --> 2:25:24.480]  The world will look up and shout save us
[2:25:24.480 --> 2:25:39.480]  Watchman
[2:25:39.480 --> 2:25:41.480]  Alright, now the number one of film in theaters
[2:25:41.480 --> 2:25:46.480]  Now let's break this down
[2:25:46.480 --> 2:25:48.480]  In the Illuminati system of thought
[2:25:48.480 --> 2:25:50.480]  In the religion they believe in a balance
[2:25:50.480 --> 2:25:52.480]  They believe in the yin and yang
[2:25:52.480 --> 2:25:54.480]  They believe there's the evil force, the destructive force
[2:25:54.480 --> 2:25:55.480]  And the creative force
[2:25:55.480 --> 2:25:58.480]  And they believe that they have to guide
[2:25:58.480 --> 2:26:01.480]  And manipulate that force to save humanity
[2:26:01.480 --> 2:26:03.480]  They have to carry out eugenics
[2:26:03.480 --> 2:26:05.480]  They have to kill masses of us
[2:26:05.480 --> 2:26:10.480]  For our own good to rise man up
[2:26:10.480 --> 2:26:14.480]  And the man that wrote Watchman, Alan Moore
[2:26:14.480 --> 2:26:16.480]  Is an admitted mason
[2:26:16.480 --> 2:26:20.480]  And the entire, he writes other comics
[2:26:20.480 --> 2:26:22.480]  Like the Sandman and others
[2:26:22.480 --> 2:26:23.480]  It's all about the New World Order
[2:26:23.480 --> 2:26:24.480]  It's all about the Illuminati
[2:26:24.480 --> 2:26:26.480]  It's all about secret societies
[2:26:26.480 --> 2:26:30.480]  In this novel with the films based on
[2:26:30.480 --> 2:26:31.480]  And it's also like that in the film
[2:26:31.480 --> 2:26:33.480]  It's called the Pyramid Corporation
[2:26:33.480 --> 2:26:36.480]  And the Great Pyramid Corporation
[2:26:36.480 --> 2:26:38.480]  And they can't figure out who it is
[2:26:38.480 --> 2:26:41.480]  Or why the Pyramid Corporation is killing
[2:26:41.480 --> 2:26:43.480]  The other Watchman
[2:26:43.480 --> 2:26:46.480]  Well that's because it's a new age
[2:26:46.480 --> 2:26:53.480]  And Dr. Manhattan in a fission fusion experiment
[2:26:53.480 --> 2:26:57.480]  At Rockefeller Military Research Institute
[2:26:57.480 --> 2:27:00.480]  Has been turned in to this God man
[2:27:00.480 --> 2:27:02.480]  Who can control matter anywhere in the universe
[2:27:02.480 --> 2:27:04.480]  At any time, be in multiple places
[2:27:04.480 --> 2:27:07.480]  Go forwards in time, go backwards in time
[2:27:07.480 --> 2:27:10.480]  He's God, he's the new God man
[2:27:10.480 --> 2:27:15.480]  He is the new man that the elite is reaching for
[2:27:15.480 --> 2:27:20.480]  Now this individual, the comedian
[2:27:20.480 --> 2:27:25.480]  Is a special forces commando
[2:27:25.480 --> 2:27:27.480]  And they have him in the film
[2:27:27.480 --> 2:27:31.480]  Blowing Kennedy's head off from behind
[2:27:31.480 --> 2:27:33.480]  The grassy knoll
[2:27:33.480 --> 2:27:35.480]  They have him running special ops
[2:27:35.480 --> 2:27:37.480]  And assassinations around the world
[2:27:37.480 --> 2:27:40.480]  Richard Nixon, this is based in the early 80s
[2:27:40.480 --> 2:27:42.480]  Is in his third term
[2:27:42.480 --> 2:27:44.480]  As the President of the United States
[2:27:44.480 --> 2:27:46.480]  Are on the verge of nuclear armageddon
[2:27:46.480 --> 2:27:48.480]  With the Soviet Union
[2:27:48.480 --> 2:27:52.480]  Because the United States is surrounding Russia
[2:27:52.480 --> 2:27:55.480]  Notice the Cold War is being brought back right now
[2:27:55.480 --> 2:27:57.480]  Notice they have encircled Russia
[2:27:57.480 --> 2:27:59.480]  And they're moving weapons systems in
[2:27:59.480 --> 2:28:02.480]  They snuck attack Georgia in South Ossetia
[2:28:02.480 --> 2:28:04.480]  As a pretext to start World War III
[2:28:04.480 --> 2:28:06.480]  But that failed back on 888
[2:28:06.480 --> 2:28:08.480]  Look at the numerology yet again
[2:28:08.480 --> 2:28:10.480]  With these individuals
[2:28:10.480 --> 2:28:13.480]  And the different characters are
[2:28:13.480 --> 2:28:17.480]  Maidal, the comedian, Rorschach, Dr. Manhattan, Silk Specter
[2:28:17.480 --> 2:28:19.480]  Ozzy Mandius
[2:28:19.480 --> 2:28:24.480]  And Ozzy Mandius has a super brain
[2:28:24.480 --> 2:28:26.480]  He is the smartest man in the world
[2:28:26.480 --> 2:28:28.480]  In fact, he's even smarter
[2:28:28.480 --> 2:28:30.480]  At this point in his development
[2:28:30.480 --> 2:28:34.480]  Than the God man, Dr. Manhattan
[2:28:34.480 --> 2:28:46.480]  Who is just now discovering his powers
[2:28:46.480 --> 2:28:51.480]  Now, Rorschach is the runt of the group
[2:28:51.480 --> 2:28:53.480]  And Rorschach was abused as a child
[2:28:53.480 --> 2:28:55.480]  And Rorschach goes around killing serial killers
[2:28:55.480 --> 2:28:57.480]  And child kidnappers
[2:28:57.480 --> 2:28:59.480]  And they repeatedly say he's backwards
[2:28:59.480 --> 2:29:01.480]  He's stupid, he's a sociopath
[2:29:01.480 --> 2:29:04.480]  He's the bad guy
[2:29:04.480 --> 2:29:08.480]  Rorschach is fighting the pyramid corporation
[2:29:08.480 --> 2:29:10.480]  He's the conspiracy theorist
[2:29:10.480 --> 2:29:13.480]  And he goes to Ozzy Mandius
[2:29:13.480 --> 2:29:18.480]  And says, I think somebody's trying to kill the watchman
[2:29:18.480 --> 2:29:21.480]  Not knowing he's actually going to the very individual
[2:29:21.480 --> 2:29:23.480]  That is out there trying to kill the watchman
[2:29:23.480 --> 2:29:26.480]  Starting with the comedian
[2:29:26.480 --> 2:29:28.480]  Now, why did they have to kill the comedian?
[2:29:28.480 --> 2:29:31.480]  Because he works for the government
[2:29:31.480 --> 2:29:34.480]  At the highest levels with the pyramid corporation
[2:29:34.480 --> 2:29:38.480]  And he doesn't want to be part of the global false flag attack
[2:29:38.480 --> 2:29:41.480]  That's going to be launched to bring in
[2:29:41.480 --> 2:29:43.480]  The new kingdom of Earth
[2:29:43.480 --> 2:29:45.480]  The new world order
[2:29:45.480 --> 2:29:48.480]  We're going to come right back and break this down
[2:29:48.480 --> 2:29:50.480]  Stay with us
[2:29:50.480 --> 2:29:52.480]  We're on the march
[2:29:52.480 --> 2:29:54.480]  The Empire's on the run
[2:29:54.480 --> 2:29:58.480]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network
[2:30:01.480 --> 2:30:03.480]  With food prices soaring to all time highs
[2:30:03.480 --> 2:30:06.480]  As the dollar continues to fall in value
[2:30:06.480 --> 2:30:08.480]  What can you and your family do to guarantee
[2:30:08.480 --> 2:30:11.480]  That fresh nutritious vegetables will make it to your dinner table?

[2:31:00.480 --> 2:31:02.480]  On September 11th, 2001
[2:31:02.480 --> 2:31:05.480]  Along with hundreds of my fellow troops
[2:31:05.480 --> 2:31:08.480]  I went to ground here and we knew what to do
[2:31:08.480 --> 2:31:10.480]  Or at least we thought we did
[2:31:10.480 --> 2:31:12.480]  Truth Rising is a breakthrough 9-11 film
[2:31:12.480 --> 2:31:15.480]  That finally gives first responders a platform
[2:31:15.480 --> 2:31:17.480]  To tell their story
[2:31:17.480 --> 2:31:23.480]  And then EPA director on the 18th made a statement
[2:31:23.480 --> 2:31:26.480]  That the air was safe to breathe
[2:31:26.480 --> 2:31:29.480]  This film follows the growing momentum of 9-11 truth
[2:31:29.480 --> 2:31:31.480]  As brave souls throughout the world
[2:31:31.480 --> 2:31:33.480]  Take action against their global masters
[2:31:33.480 --> 2:31:36.480]  He had his hand over the radio while he was getting a countdown
[2:31:36.480 --> 2:31:39.480]  He takes his hand off and you hear it three, two, one
[2:31:39.480 --> 2:31:42.480]  And it was boom, boom, boom, boom, boom
[2:31:42.480 --> 2:31:45.480]  This is an emergency transmission worldwide
[2:31:45.480 --> 2:31:48.480]  To download Truth Rising at prisonplanet.tv
[2:31:48.480 --> 2:31:51.480]  And aggressively spread it worldwide

[2:31:54.480 --> 2:31:56.480]  If we don't expose the government sponsored terror
[2:31:56.480 --> 2:32:00.480]  They're going to commit more acts and bring in martial law
[2:32:00.480 --> 2:32:04.480]  Silver is mankind's oldest natural antibiotic
[2:32:04.480 --> 2:32:06.480]  This very special mineral has been used for centuries
[2:32:06.480 --> 2:32:08.480]  By most cultures throughout the world
[2:32:08.480 --> 2:32:12.480]  Utopia, Texas is home to a small but mighty supplement company

[2:32:19.480 --> 2:32:23.480]  Because our colloidal silver is made up of nanosized particles
[2:32:23.480 --> 2:32:25.480]  It can be better utilized at the cellular level
[2:32:25.480 --> 2:32:30.480]  And germs can't mutate to be resistant like they can to modern-day antibiotics
[2:32:30.480 --> 2:32:33.480]  Utopia Silver has a broad range of health supplements

[2:32:35.480 --> 2:32:38.480]  With a money bag guarantee on the colloidal products we produce
[2:32:38.480 --> 2:32:42.480]  For four years Utopia Silver has been fighting in the Texas courts
[2:32:42.480 --> 2:32:45.480]  Against agencies that would steal our God-given rights of health care

[2:33:00.480 --> 2:33:02.480]  All right, thank you for joining us
[2:33:02.480 --> 2:33:05.480]  We'll go right back into the transmission here today
[2:33:07.480 --> 2:33:09.480]  I'm going to take my time doing this review
[2:33:09.480 --> 2:33:13.480]  Because it's very, very important of Watchmen
[2:33:13.480 --> 2:33:16.480]  Now the number one movie in theaters
[2:33:16.480 --> 2:33:19.480]  And with all these different reviewers
[2:33:19.480 --> 2:33:22.480]  Saying they don't understand the ending, they don't understand it
[2:33:22.480 --> 2:33:23.480]  Well, it's real simple
[2:33:23.480 --> 2:33:26.480]  Rorschach, the director of Rorschach
[2:33:26.480 --> 2:33:30.480]  They don't understand the ending, they don't understand it
[2:33:30.480 --> 2:33:31.480]  Well, it's real simple
[2:33:31.480 --> 2:33:34.480]  Rorschach and also the comedian
[2:33:34.480 --> 2:33:36.480]  Want to stop
[2:33:36.480 --> 2:33:39.480]  These are the two, you know, sub superheroes
[2:33:39.480 --> 2:33:43.480]  They want to stop the planned false flag terror attack
[2:33:43.480 --> 2:33:46.480]  That they know is being planned by somebody
[2:33:46.480 --> 2:33:49.480]  Now the comedian knows that it's being planned by
[2:33:49.480 --> 2:33:50.480]  So he's torn
[2:33:50.480 --> 2:33:53.480]  He's the guy that assassinated Kennedy from behind the grass
[2:33:53.480 --> 2:33:55.480]  He's a new world order special forces hitman
[2:33:55.480 --> 2:33:56.480]  He's that archetype
[2:33:56.480 --> 2:33:58.480]  So he has to be killed
[2:33:58.480 --> 2:34:01.480]  Rorschach is then finally killed
[2:34:01.480 --> 2:34:03.480]  Because he's going to expose at the end
[2:34:03.480 --> 2:34:06.480]  Who staged the false flag attack
[2:34:06.480 --> 2:34:09.480]  And we'll break that down coming up here in just a few minutes
[2:34:09.480 --> 2:34:12.480]  But to understand what's happening here
[2:34:12.480 --> 2:34:15.480]  You have to first understand how the globalists operate
[2:34:15.480 --> 2:34:18.480]  How they believe that they must reveal
[2:34:18.480 --> 2:34:21.480]  Their plans to the public before they do it
[2:34:21.480 --> 2:34:24.480]  And there's thousands of examples of this
[2:34:24.480 --> 2:34:27.480]  Scores of books and films
[2:34:27.480 --> 2:34:30.480]  A Tom Clancy book in 99 came out
[2:34:30.480 --> 2:34:34.480]  Where a hijacked jet is flown to the World Trade Center
[2:34:34.480 --> 2:34:37.480]  And the Pentagon did drills of hijacked jets
[2:34:37.480 --> 2:34:39.480]  Being flown to the Pentagon and World Trade Center
[2:34:39.480 --> 2:34:41.480]  They ran drills that morning
[2:34:41.480 --> 2:34:44.480]  Of hijacked jets being flown to the World Trade Center and Pentagon
[2:34:44.480 --> 2:34:47.480]  And Norad's on tape saying, is this real world exercise?
[2:34:47.480 --> 2:34:50.480]  I've got simulated blips over the real blips
[2:34:50.480 --> 2:34:53.480]  When they bombed the trains and the bus
[2:34:53.480 --> 2:34:54.480]  On 7-7
[2:34:54.480 --> 2:34:57.480]  Again, they launched the attack on Russia 8-8-8
[2:34:57.480 --> 2:35:00.480]  They launched the attack on 7-7
[2:35:00.480 --> 2:35:03.480]  They launched the attack in Madrid on 3-3-3
[2:35:03.480 --> 2:35:05.480]  They're obsessed with numerology
[2:35:05.480 --> 2:35:08.480]  Just like low level psychopaths are obsessed with numerology
[2:35:08.480 --> 2:35:11.480]  And the occult, if you study criminology
[2:35:11.480 --> 2:35:14.480]  And they like to leave tokens, they like to leave warnings
[2:35:14.480 --> 2:35:16.480]  They like to write letters to the police
[2:35:16.480 --> 2:35:18.480]  In the case of the Zodiac and many others
[2:35:18.480 --> 2:35:21.480]  Taunting them or son of Sam
[2:35:21.480 --> 2:35:24.480]  Most of these big national serial killer operations
[2:35:24.480 --> 2:35:27.480]  Are done by cults and that's come out
[2:35:27.480 --> 2:35:29.480]  So they're obsessed with numerology
[2:35:29.480 --> 2:35:32.480]  But as the low level people engage in this
[2:35:32.480 --> 2:35:34.480]  So to the high level
[2:35:34.480 --> 2:35:36.480]  As above, so below
[2:35:36.480 --> 2:35:39.480]  And you have the occultist, the Mason
[2:35:39.480 --> 2:35:41.480]  Alan Moore
[2:35:41.480 --> 2:35:45.480]  In his novel, The Watchman
[2:35:45.480 --> 2:35:49.480]  The most celebrated graphic novel out there
[2:35:49.480 --> 2:35:52.480]  Admitting all of this
[2:35:52.480 --> 2:35:55.480]  Okay, so
[2:35:55.480 --> 2:35:57.480]  I get approached
[2:35:57.480 --> 2:36:00.480]  Now four years ago by one of the stars of the X-Files
[2:36:00.480 --> 2:36:03.480]  One of the stars of the spinoff of that
[2:36:03.480 --> 2:36:05.480]  The lone gunman on Fox
[2:36:05.480 --> 2:36:08.480]  And he says, Alex, I know you've been playing clips on air
[2:36:08.480 --> 2:36:10.480]  From that pilot episode of The Load Gunman
[2:36:10.480 --> 2:36:12.480]  That aired six months before 9-11
[2:36:12.480 --> 2:36:14.480]  Where the government hijacks a jet
[2:36:14.480 --> 2:36:16.480]  By remote control to fly it in the World Trade Center
[2:36:16.480 --> 2:36:19.480]  And uses a drill to make NORAD stand down
[2:36:19.480 --> 2:36:21.480]  Exactly what then happened six months later
[2:36:21.480 --> 2:36:25.480]  As a pretext to attack Afghanistan
[2:36:25.480 --> 2:36:27.480]  And he said, yes, it's true
[2:36:27.480 --> 2:36:30.480]  And the CIA would approach us and Chris Carter
[2:36:30.480 --> 2:36:34.480]  And say, we want you to do stories on this
[2:36:34.480 --> 2:36:36.480]  And you can just Google Alex Jones, Dean Haglin
[2:36:36.480 --> 2:36:38.480]  And watch one interview at my house
[2:36:38.480 --> 2:36:40.480]  When he came to my home
[2:36:40.480 --> 2:36:42.480]  I got a call, hey
[2:36:42.480 --> 2:36:44.480]  Dean Haglin wants to come to your house
[2:36:44.480 --> 2:36:46.480]  And sure, boom, Dean Haglin's there a couple days later
[2:36:46.480 --> 2:36:48.480]  Drove from California to meet me
[2:36:52.480 --> 2:36:54.480]  What was he talking about?
[2:36:54.480 --> 2:36:56.480]  How does this tie to the Watchman?
[2:36:56.480 --> 2:36:58.480]  This is from the lone gunman
[2:36:58.480 --> 2:37:00.480]  Where one of the lone gunman investigators
[2:37:00.480 --> 2:37:02.480]  Conspiracy theorists is talking to his father
[2:37:02.480 --> 2:37:04.480]  High-level National Security Council
[2:37:04.480 --> 2:37:06.480]  About the government, a criminal group
[2:37:06.480 --> 2:37:08.480]  Planning a stage of terror attack
[2:37:08.480 --> 2:37:10.480]  And using drills to make NORAD stand down
[2:37:10.480 --> 2:37:12.480]  To then attack
[2:37:12.480 --> 2:37:15.480]  Afghanistan, here it is
[2:37:16.480 --> 2:37:18.480]  What is scenario 12D?
[2:37:20.480 --> 2:37:23.480]  We know it's a war game scenario
[2:37:23.480 --> 2:37:25.480]  That it has to do with airline counter-terrorism
[2:37:26.480 --> 2:37:28.480]  Why is it important enough to kill for?
[2:37:28.480 --> 2:37:30.480]  Because it's no longer a game
[2:37:31.480 --> 2:37:35.480]  If some terrorist group wants to act out this scenario
[2:37:35.480 --> 2:37:38.480]  Why target you for assassination?
[2:37:38.480 --> 2:37:42.480]  Depends on who your terrorists are
[2:37:42.480 --> 2:37:45.480]  The men who conceived of it in the first place
[2:37:46.480 --> 2:37:49.480]  You're saying our government plans to commit a terrorist act
[2:37:49.480 --> 2:37:50.480]  Against a domestic airline?
[2:37:50.480 --> 2:37:51.480]  There you go
[2:37:51.480 --> 2:37:53.480]  Dying the entire government as usual
[2:37:53.480 --> 2:37:55.480]  It's a faction, a small faction
[2:37:55.480 --> 2:37:57.480]  For what possible gain?
[2:37:57.480 --> 2:37:59.480]  The Cold War's over, John
[2:37:59.480 --> 2:38:01.480]  But with no clear enemy to stop pile
[2:38:01.480 --> 2:38:03.480]  Against the arms market's flat
[2:38:03.480 --> 2:38:05.480]  But bring down a fully loaded 727
[2:38:05.480 --> 2:38:07.480]  Into the middle of New York City
[2:38:07.480 --> 2:38:09.480]  And you'll find a dozen tin-pot dictators
[2:38:09.480 --> 2:38:11.480]  All over the world
[2:38:11.480 --> 2:38:13.480]  Just clamoring to take responsibility
[2:38:13.480 --> 2:38:15.480]  And begging to be smart-bombed
[2:38:15.480 --> 2:38:16.480]  I can't believe it
[2:38:16.480 --> 2:38:18.480]  This is about increasing arms sales
[2:38:20.480 --> 2:38:22.480]  When?
[2:38:22.480 --> 2:38:23.480]  Tonight
[2:38:23.480 --> 2:38:25.480]  How are you going to stop them?
[2:38:27.480 --> 2:38:29.480]  Why didn't you tell the world this?
[2:38:29.480 --> 2:38:30.480]  Go to the press
[2:38:30.480 --> 2:38:33.480]  You think I'd still be drawing breath 30 minutes after I made that call?
[2:38:33.480 --> 2:38:34.480]  The press?
[2:38:34.480 --> 2:38:36.480]  Who's going to run this story?
[2:38:36.480 --> 2:38:37.480]  We would
[2:38:37.480 --> 2:38:38.480]  This?
[2:38:41.480 --> 2:38:43.480]  It's a birdcage liner
[2:38:43.480 --> 2:38:45.480]  Wild-eyed crap right up there with
[2:38:45.480 --> 2:38:47.480]  Elvis as an alien and two-headed babies
[2:38:47.480 --> 2:38:49.480]  You'll obviously read it
[2:38:49.480 --> 2:38:51.480]  Don't be so damn naive
[2:38:51.480 --> 2:38:53.480]  You think this is going to save the world?
[2:38:59.480 --> 2:39:01.480]  I'm doing what I can, John
[2:39:01.480 --> 2:39:04.480]  I don't have all the specifics on Scenario 12D
[2:39:04.480 --> 2:39:06.480]  But I think I know the flight they've chosen
[2:39:06.480 --> 2:39:08.480]  I still think we should call
[2:39:08.480 --> 2:39:09.480]  In a bomb threat
[2:39:09.480 --> 2:39:11.480]  Let the FBI deal with this
[2:39:11.480 --> 2:39:13.480]  Set yourself we don't know the full extent of this conspiracy
[2:39:13.480 --> 2:39:15.480]  We can't trust any government official
[2:39:15.480 --> 2:39:17.480]  They hope this to get on that plane
[2:39:27.480 --> 2:39:28.480]  They're boarding
[2:39:28.480 --> 2:39:35.480]  But that's two problems solved
[2:39:50.480 --> 2:39:52.480]  He's now on board the aircraft
[2:39:52.480 --> 2:39:54.480]  Trying to look for the remote control system
[2:39:54.480 --> 2:39:56.480]  So the Pentagon can fly into the World Trade Center
[2:39:56.480 --> 2:39:58.480]  They don't even know it's the World Trade Center
[2:39:58.480 --> 2:40:00.480]  It's the target yet
[2:40:00.480 --> 2:40:02.480]  But you can simply Google
[2:40:02.480 --> 2:40:04.480]  Lone Gunman TV show
[2:40:04.480 --> 2:40:06.480]  For shadows 9-11
[2:40:06.480 --> 2:40:08.480]  Well let it hold clear if this thing can be trusted
[2:40:08.480 --> 2:40:10.480]  But you don't make it with your erector, Seth
[2:40:10.480 --> 2:40:12.480]  I'm so sure that this is the targeted flight
[2:40:12.480 --> 2:40:15.480]  This flight was chosen primarily for its visibility
[2:40:15.480 --> 2:40:18.480]  It's scheduled to pass over Manhattan on its way to Boston
[2:40:20.480 --> 2:40:23.480]  You said they intend to bring this down
[2:40:23.480 --> 2:40:26.480]  In the middle of New York City
[2:40:26.480 --> 2:40:29.480]  What if there is no bomb?
[2:40:29.480 --> 2:40:31.480]  How are they going to bring it down?
[2:40:31.480 --> 2:40:34.480]  The same way a dead man can drive a car
[2:40:38.480 --> 2:40:40.480]  In the Jean of Bob
[2:40:40.480 --> 2:40:43.480]  I need you to hack into the aircraft's onboard navigation system
[2:40:43.480 --> 2:40:45.480]  We need to know where we're headed
[2:40:45.480 --> 2:40:47.480]  Okay, go on to headsets
[2:40:49.480 --> 2:40:51.480]  I'll call on the Air Force carrier
[2:40:51.480 --> 2:40:53.480]  We're sending a ground air fox
[2:40:53.480 --> 2:40:55.480]  That's one twisted Star-69
[2:40:55.480 --> 2:40:57.480]  I'll just get ready to ride the wave
[2:40:57.480 --> 2:40:59.480]  Just get me on that plane and I'll get you out of pilot access
[2:40:59.480 --> 2:41:01.480]  How are you going to do that?
[2:41:01.480 --> 2:41:03.480]  Airline telemetry systems use processors
[2:41:03.480 --> 2:41:05.480]  Similarly those found in CB radios
[2:41:05.480 --> 2:41:07.480]  I'm in. We've got to tell the convoy
[2:41:07.480 --> 2:41:09.480]  What's your progress?
[2:41:09.480 --> 2:41:11.480]  I've hacked into the flight control system output
[2:41:11.480 --> 2:41:13.480]  What's that little bit of help?
[2:41:13.480 --> 2:41:15.480]  It's what the brains of the plane is telling the little black box
[2:41:15.480 --> 2:41:17.480]  Force heading attitude hold
[2:41:17.480 --> 2:41:19.480]  Your access stabilization work
[2:41:19.480 --> 2:41:21.480]  What the heck's that?
[2:41:21.480 --> 2:41:23.480]  Is that what it looks like?
[2:41:23.480 --> 2:41:25.480]  I think it is what it looks like
[2:41:25.480 --> 2:41:27.480]  What does what look like?
[2:41:27.480 --> 2:41:29.480]  Modem protocols, remote access
[2:41:29.480 --> 2:41:31.480]  Somebody on the ground is flying your plane
[2:41:31.480 --> 2:41:33.480]  Bogey sir, keep your course
[2:41:37.480 --> 2:41:39.480]  I need to know where flight plan
[2:41:39.480 --> 2:41:49.480]  I'm mapping the data now
[2:41:57.480 --> 2:41:59.480]  Fires
[2:41:59.480 --> 2:42:01.480]  Your flight's going to make an unscheduled stop
[2:42:01.480 --> 2:42:03.480]  In exactly 22 minutes
[2:42:05.480 --> 2:42:07.480]  Corner of Liberty in Washington
[2:42:07.480 --> 2:42:09.480]  Foreman out
[2:42:09.480 --> 2:42:11.480]  World Trade Center
[2:42:11.480 --> 2:42:13.480]  I'm going to crash the plane into the World Trade Center
[2:42:13.480 --> 2:42:15.480]  I'll tell the flight
[2:42:15.480 --> 2:42:17.480]  Land link
[2:42:17.480 --> 2:42:19.480]  Can you override the flight control system?
[2:42:19.480 --> 2:42:21.480]  I'm working on it
[2:42:23.480 --> 2:42:25.480]  Alright, that's enough
[2:42:25.480 --> 2:42:27.480]  What is this?
[2:42:27.480 --> 2:42:29.480]  If folks want to go watch the full thing, it's online everywhere
[2:42:29.480 --> 2:42:31.480]  You can even buy the DVD and stores of the series
[2:42:31.480 --> 2:42:33.480]  Now
[2:42:33.480 --> 2:42:35.480]  There are hundreds of examples of this
[2:42:35.480 --> 2:42:37.480]  A few months ago we read a prisonplanet.com story
[2:42:37.480 --> 2:42:39.480]  About a 2002 Tom Clancy video game
[2:42:39.480 --> 2:42:41.480]  Where in
[2:42:41.480 --> 2:42:43.480]  2008
[2:42:43.480 --> 2:42:45.480]  The US, Israel and NATO
[2:42:45.480 --> 2:42:47.480]  Launched a sneak attack on Russia
[2:42:47.480 --> 2:42:49.480]  In South Ossetia
[2:42:49.480 --> 2:42:51.480]  And then now the new version of the game
[2:42:51.480 --> 2:42:53.480]  Came out and it continues
[2:42:53.480 --> 2:42:55.480]  And shows how that will then lead to World War 3
[2:42:55.480 --> 2:42:57.480]  By 2011
[2:42:57.480 --> 2:42:59.480]  And they do this everywhere
[2:42:59.480 --> 2:43:01.480]  And the Pentagon admittedly spends
[2:43:01.480 --> 2:43:03.480]  Hundreds of millions of dollars a year
[2:43:03.480 --> 2:43:05.480]  Just having Hollywood write them
[2:43:05.480 --> 2:43:07.480]  Terrorist script scenarios
[2:43:07.480 --> 2:43:09.480]  That are never made into films
[2:43:11.480 --> 2:43:13.480]  They are then used to map and war game
[2:43:13.480 --> 2:43:15.480]  And if somebody catches one of their agents
[2:43:15.480 --> 2:43:17.480]  Planning a terror attack, well it's just a script for a movie
[2:43:19.480 --> 2:43:21.480]  See this is all a stage
[2:43:21.480 --> 2:43:23.480]  As
[2:43:25.480 --> 2:43:27.480]  Was once said
[2:43:27.480 --> 2:43:29.480]  The whole world is nothing but a stage and each of us
[2:43:29.480 --> 2:43:31.480]  Players upon it
[2:43:31.480 --> 2:43:33.480]  William Shakespeare
[2:43:33.480 --> 2:43:35.480]  So
[2:43:35.480 --> 2:43:37.480]  Why am I so concerned about the Watchmen
[2:43:37.480 --> 2:43:39.480]  It was a 3 hour menacing
[2:43:39.480 --> 2:43:41.480]  Threat
[2:43:41.480 --> 2:43:43.480]  The entire agenda thrown in our face
[2:43:43.480 --> 2:43:45.480]  Of what the globalists are going to do to us
[2:43:45.480 --> 2:43:47.480]  Now let me now break it down for you
[2:43:47.480 --> 2:43:49.480]  Let's just go right to the end
[2:43:53.480 --> 2:43:55.480]  Dr. Manhattan who's been endowed with
[2:43:55.480 --> 2:43:57.480]  Godlike powers
[2:43:57.480 --> 2:43:59.480]  Is working overtime
[2:43:59.480 --> 2:44:01.480]  With Ozzy Mandamus
[2:44:01.480 --> 2:44:03.480]  The, quote, smartest man in the world
[2:44:05.480 --> 2:44:07.480]  Who wears an Illuminati all-seeing-eye breastplate
[2:44:09.480 --> 2:44:11.480]  And he's working with Ozzy Mandamus
[2:44:11.480 --> 2:44:13.480]  He believes to stop
[2:44:13.480 --> 2:44:15.480]  A Russian
[2:44:15.480 --> 2:44:17.480]  US nuclear war
[2:44:17.480 --> 2:44:19.480]  With over 100,000 warheads
[2:44:19.480 --> 2:44:21.480]  That would completely destroy the planet
[2:44:21.480 --> 2:44:23.480]  But somebody
[2:44:23.480 --> 2:44:25.480]  Is blocking
[2:44:25.480 --> 2:44:27.480]  His future site
[2:44:27.480 --> 2:44:29.480]  Using some type of
[2:44:29.480 --> 2:44:31.480]  Special radiation generating system
[2:44:31.480 --> 2:44:33.480]  That goes forward and backwards in time
[2:44:33.480 --> 2:44:35.480]  Blocking Dr. Manhattan's site
[2:44:35.480 --> 2:44:37.480]  But Dr. Manhattan is building this giant generator
[2:44:37.480 --> 2:44:39.480]  That has his powers
[2:44:39.480 --> 2:44:41.480]  To give it to
[2:44:41.480 --> 2:44:43.480]  Ozzy Mandamus
[2:44:43.480 --> 2:44:45.480]  So he can have these Godlike powers
[2:44:45.480 --> 2:44:47.480]  And control it through a computer
[2:44:49.480 --> 2:44:51.480]  And
[2:44:51.480 --> 2:44:53.480]  Dr. Manhattan is somewhat of a baby
[2:44:53.480 --> 2:44:55.480]  He's only been a superhuman
[2:44:55.480 --> 2:44:57.480]  For about 25 years
[2:44:57.480 --> 2:44:59.480]  He's learning more and more
[2:44:59.480 --> 2:45:01.480]  About his Godlike power
[2:45:01.480 --> 2:45:03.480]  And at the end of the movie
[2:45:05.480 --> 2:45:07.480]  Rorschach and others have figured out
[2:45:07.480 --> 2:45:09.480]  What's really going on
[2:45:09.480 --> 2:45:11.480]  And
[2:45:11.480 --> 2:45:13.480]  This new God, the first Godlike man
[2:45:13.480 --> 2:45:15.480]  The new man, the Illuminati new man
[2:45:15.480 --> 2:45:17.480]  He's on Mars building these crystal cities
[2:45:17.480 --> 2:45:19.480]  And doing all of this
[2:45:19.480 --> 2:45:21.480]  He's left the love of his life
[2:45:21.480 --> 2:45:23.480]  He's thinking about never coming back to Earth
[2:45:23.480 --> 2:45:25.480]  But she calls him back, she goes to Mars with him
[2:45:25.480 --> 2:45:27.480]  They then come back to Earth
[2:45:27.480 --> 2:45:29.480]  They teleport to the command base
[2:45:29.480 --> 2:45:31.480]  Of Ozzy Mandamus
[2:45:31.480 --> 2:45:33.480]  They now know that he's the one
[2:45:33.480 --> 2:45:35.480]  Behind the plan to blow up
[2:45:35.480 --> 2:45:37.480]  Large portions of every major city on Earth
[2:45:37.480 --> 2:45:39.480]  Including New York City
[2:45:41.480 --> 2:45:43.480]  And the World Trade Center
[2:45:43.480 --> 2:45:45.480]  And so using this special
[2:45:45.480 --> 2:45:47.480]  Advanced technology
[2:45:47.480 --> 2:45:49.480]  Fish and Fusion weapon
[2:45:49.480 --> 2:45:51.480]  Ozzy Mandamus does
[2:45:51.480 --> 2:45:53.480]  Blow up the World Trade Center
[2:45:53.480 --> 2:45:55.480]  And then it cuts to
[2:45:55.480 --> 2:45:57.480]  The wound in the Earth that looks identical
[2:45:57.480 --> 2:45:59.480]  To the wound in the Earth after they had dug it all out
[2:45:59.480 --> 2:46:01.480]  Of the World Trade Center
[2:46:01.480 --> 2:46:03.480]  It shows all the banners of
[2:46:03.480 --> 2:46:05.480]  We'll never forget American flags and things
[2:46:05.480 --> 2:46:07.480]  And he says to
[2:46:11.480 --> 2:46:13.480]  Dr. Manhattan, Ozzy Mandamus
[2:46:13.480 --> 2:46:15.480]  Who's basically Lucifer says to his
[2:46:15.480 --> 2:46:17.480]  Twin brother
[2:46:17.480 --> 2:46:19.480]  God or Jesus
[2:46:19.480 --> 2:46:21.480]  Don't you see why I did this now
[2:46:21.480 --> 2:46:23.480]  This stopped nuclear war
[2:46:23.480 --> 2:46:25.480]  By me staging these terror attacks
[2:46:25.480 --> 2:46:27.480]  Worldwide, now the Soviets
[2:46:27.480 --> 2:46:29.480]  And the United States are friends and working together
[2:46:31.480 --> 2:46:33.480]  And the bad guy
[2:46:33.480 --> 2:46:35.480]  They bill him as the bad guy, Rorschach
[2:46:35.480 --> 2:46:37.480]  Who
[2:46:37.480 --> 2:46:39.480]  Has been saying no to all of this
[2:46:39.480 --> 2:46:41.480]  He says that's it, I'm in the war in the world
[2:46:41.480 --> 2:46:43.480]  I'm going to tell everybody
[2:46:43.480 --> 2:46:45.480]  And Dr. Manhattan
[2:46:45.480 --> 2:46:47.480]  Kills him, blows him into bits
[2:46:47.480 --> 2:46:49.480]  Arisalizes him
[2:46:49.480 --> 2:46:51.480]  And that is the message
[2:46:51.480 --> 2:46:53.480]  The world is saved
[2:46:53.480 --> 2:46:55.480]  There's a new kingdom being set up by the Pyramid Corporation
[2:46:55.480 --> 2:46:57.480]  A world government
[2:46:57.480 --> 2:46:59.480]  And Lucifer
[2:46:59.480 --> 2:47:01.480]  Ozzy Mandamus is going to stay on the Earth
[2:47:03.480 --> 2:47:05.480]  And
[2:47:05.480 --> 2:47:07.480]  The new man is going to travel
[2:47:07.480 --> 2:47:09.480]  The stars as a god
[2:47:09.480 --> 2:47:11.480]  And says I'm leaving to go explore the universe
[2:47:13.480 --> 2:47:15.480]  And that's how the movie ends
[2:47:15.480 --> 2:47:17.480]  The Earth has been saved
[2:47:17.480 --> 2:47:19.480]  The bad guy
[2:47:19.480 --> 2:47:21.480]  Has been killed
[2:47:21.480 --> 2:47:23.480]  Rorschach, who's against child molestation
[2:47:23.480 --> 2:47:25.480]  And against tyranny and against police brutality
[2:47:25.480 --> 2:47:27.480]  He's the bad guy
[2:47:27.480 --> 2:47:29.480]  He is killed, everyone is saved
[2:47:29.480 --> 2:47:31.480]  Because the evil sociopath
[2:47:31.480 --> 2:47:33.480]  Rorschach has been defeated
[2:47:37.480 --> 2:47:39.480]  And there's many other archetypal images and programming
[2:47:39.480 --> 2:47:41.480]  In the film
[2:47:41.480 --> 2:47:43.480]  The real attack the globalists are going to launch
[2:47:43.480 --> 2:47:45.480]  Amongst many
[2:47:45.480 --> 2:47:47.480]  Will be a biological holocaust
[2:47:47.480 --> 2:47:49.480]  To bring the world together
[2:47:49.480 --> 2:47:51.480]  And so
[2:47:51.480 --> 2:47:53.480]  This is an open threat to everyone
[2:47:53.480 --> 2:47:55.480]  And this is the globalist saying
[2:47:55.480 --> 2:47:57.480]  Yes, we killed Kennedy for your own good
[2:47:57.480 --> 2:47:59.480]  Yes, the pyramid
[2:47:59.480 --> 2:48:01.480]  Corporation
[2:48:01.480 --> 2:48:03.480]  Stages the terror attacks
[2:48:03.480 --> 2:48:05.480]  And they showed 9-11 as the pit
[2:48:05.480 --> 2:48:07.480]  After he blows up Lower Manhattan
[2:48:07.480 --> 2:48:09.480]  I mean, it is literally
[2:48:09.480 --> 2:48:11.480]  An exact copy of the pit
[2:48:11.480 --> 2:48:13.480]  After it was dug out with the big American flags
[2:48:13.480 --> 2:48:15.480]  And we will never forget
[2:48:17.480 --> 2:48:19.480]  And that is the message
[2:48:19.480 --> 2:48:21.480]  And after Dr. Manhattan
[2:48:21.480 --> 2:48:23.480]  Finds out that
[2:48:23.480 --> 2:48:25.480]  Ozzy Mandaman staged the terror attacks
[2:48:25.480 --> 2:48:27.480]  He says, yes, it makes total sense
[2:48:27.480 --> 2:48:29.480]  You've done a fabulous job
[2:48:29.480 --> 2:48:31.480]  You know, I totally agree with you
[2:48:31.480 --> 2:48:33.480]  This was the way to go
[2:48:33.480 --> 2:48:35.480]  And that
[2:48:35.480 --> 2:48:37.480]  Gets into some of the Egyptian mythology
[2:48:37.480 --> 2:48:39.480]  Where
[2:48:39.480 --> 2:48:41.480]  One guy kills somebody else's father
[2:48:41.480 --> 2:48:43.480]  But then the son gets to become a god
[2:48:43.480 --> 2:48:45.480]  And finally says, oh, I realize you're right
[2:48:45.480 --> 2:48:47.480]  I want to join you
[2:48:47.480 --> 2:48:49.480]  You actually have more advanced knowledge than I do
[2:48:49.480 --> 2:48:51.480]  But in truth
[2:48:51.480 --> 2:48:53.480]  The Illuminati isn't staging terror attacks
[2:48:53.480 --> 2:48:55.480]  To stop World War III
[2:48:55.480 --> 2:48:57.480]  They're staging them to bring in World War III
[2:48:57.480 --> 2:48:59.480]  And a holocaust to the majority of the population
[2:48:59.480 --> 2:49:01.480]  But at the mid
[2:49:01.480 --> 2:49:03.480]  And higher levels of the globalist order
[2:49:03.480 --> 2:49:05.480]  This is what they teach
[2:49:05.480 --> 2:49:07.480]  Well, we got to kill 3,000 to save America
[2:49:07.480 --> 2:49:09.480]  We got to stage 9-11 to save America
[2:49:15.480 --> 2:49:17.480]  Of course, the tagline
[2:49:17.480 --> 2:49:19.480]  Of the film and the movie poster at the theater
[2:49:19.480 --> 2:49:21.480]  Is there had to be a sacrifice
[2:49:21.480 --> 2:49:23.480]  The elite had to do this
[2:49:23.480 --> 2:49:25.480]  For your own good
[2:49:25.480 --> 2:49:27.480]  This had to be done to protect you
[2:49:27.480 --> 2:49:29.480]  We had to stage the terror attack
[2:49:29.480 --> 2:49:31.480]  To bring the world together
[2:49:31.480 --> 2:49:33.480]  Just as it's now declassified
[2:49:33.480 --> 2:49:35.480]  They've written books about it
[2:49:35.480 --> 2:49:37.480]  For the CIA
[2:49:37.480 --> 2:49:39.480]  As the head of the Georgetown Political Science Department
[2:49:39.480 --> 2:49:41.480]  How they staged World War I
[2:49:41.480 --> 2:49:43.480]  To bring in the League of Nations
[2:49:43.480 --> 2:49:45.480]  That was a prototype
[2:49:45.480 --> 2:49:47.480]  They staged World War II
[2:49:47.480 --> 2:49:49.480]  Funding Hitler, funding others
[2:49:49.480 --> 2:49:51.480]  The Club of Rome prototype
[2:49:51.480 --> 2:49:53.480]  The Milner Group set that up
[2:49:53.480 --> 2:49:55.480]  To bring in world crises
[2:49:55.480 --> 2:49:57.480]  So we would accept world government
[2:49:57.480 --> 2:49:59.480]  So we could be fully dominated
[2:49:59.480 --> 2:50:01.480]  So the elite can control technology
[2:50:01.480 --> 2:50:03.480]  Sequester it so we don't destroy ourselves
[2:50:03.480 --> 2:50:05.480]  So the elite
[2:50:05.480 --> 2:50:07.480]  When I say at the end of Endgame
[2:50:07.480 --> 2:50:09.480]  The elite believe they're going to merge with machines
[2:50:09.480 --> 2:50:11.480]  And then leave the planet and travel to the stars
[2:50:11.480 --> 2:50:13.480]  I'm not saying that's really going to happen
[2:50:13.480 --> 2:50:15.480]  I'm quoting what
[2:50:15.480 --> 2:50:17.480]  The head futurist are saying
[2:50:17.480 --> 2:50:19.480]  What the head of the United Nations
[2:50:19.480 --> 2:50:21.480]  UNESCO department
[2:50:21.480 --> 2:50:23.480]  Julian Huxley said
[2:50:23.480 --> 2:50:25.480]  What
[2:50:25.480 --> 2:50:27.480]  All the top futurists
[2:50:27.480 --> 2:50:29.480]  Are currently saying
[2:50:29.480 --> 2:50:31.480]  They write and say that we will all be killed
[2:50:31.480 --> 2:50:33.480]  They tell their minions we're going to kill 80%
[2:50:33.480 --> 2:50:35.480]  But their deeper documents
[2:50:35.480 --> 2:50:37.480]  And white papers say actually 99%
[2:50:37.480 --> 2:50:39.480]  Or more
[2:50:39.480 --> 2:50:41.480]  And then the elite are going to merge with machines
[2:50:41.480 --> 2:50:43.480]  And technology
[2:50:43.480 --> 2:50:45.480]  And that that is the next evolution
[2:50:45.480 --> 2:50:47.480]  Of man becoming gods
[2:50:47.480 --> 2:50:49.480]  But most of us aren't worthy
[2:50:49.480 --> 2:50:51.480]  To go to that next level
[2:50:51.480 --> 2:50:53.480]  And this film
[2:50:53.480 --> 2:50:55.480]  Watchmen is a threat to everyone
[2:50:55.480 --> 2:50:57.480]  As they are revealing

[2:52:01.480 --> 2:52:03.480]  In the long course of American history
[2:52:03.480 --> 2:52:05.480]  A terrorist act of war
[2:52:05.480 --> 2:52:07.480]  Against this country
[2:52:07.480 --> 2:52:09.480]  The enemy struck America on September 11th
[2:52:09.480 --> 2:52:11.480]  But who is the enemy?
[2:52:11.480 --> 2:52:13.480]  Bin Laden
[2:52:13.480 --> 2:52:15.480]  This is his MO
[2:52:15.480 --> 2:52:17.480]  We have to look to the Middle East
[2:52:17.480 --> 2:52:19.480]  We have to look to Osama Bin Laden
[2:52:19.480 --> 2:52:21.480]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look
[2:52:21.480 --> 2:52:23.480]  At the terrorist ties to intelligence networks
[2:52:23.480 --> 2:52:25.480]  Inside the United States
[2:52:25.480 --> 2:52:27.480]  Some US investigators believe that there are Israelis
[2:52:27.480 --> 2:52:29.480]  Again very much engaged in spying
[2:52:29.480 --> 2:52:31.480]  In and on the US
[2:52:31.480 --> 2:52:33.480]  I'm aware that some Israeli
[2:52:33.480 --> 2:52:35.480]  Citizens have been detained
[2:52:35.480 --> 2:52:37.480]  Bin Laden's connections to the CIA
[2:52:37.480 --> 2:52:39.480]  The hijackers ties to the FBI
[2:52:39.480 --> 2:52:41.480]  The Saudi Arabian connection
[2:52:41.480 --> 2:52:43.480]  The Israeli intelligence network
[2:52:43.480 --> 2:52:45.480]  Warnings and war games
[2:52:45.480 --> 2:52:47.480]  The shadow government

[2:54:19.480 --> 2:54:35.480]  The truth is the elite are dumbing everyone down, denigrating society,
[2:54:35.480 --> 2:54:39.480]  training us to love seeing our fellow humans torn limb from limb
[2:54:39.480 --> 2:54:45.480]  To desensitize us to accept this new wave, this brave new world
[2:54:45.480 --> 2:54:51.480]  And then our destruction is a regenerative good thing
[2:54:51.480 --> 2:54:55.480]  The destruction is creative when they carry it out
[2:54:55.480 --> 2:55:01.480]  And there is no doubt that this film signifies the preparation
[2:55:01.480 --> 2:55:05.480]  The fact that they've released it now for staged massive terror attacks
[2:55:05.480 --> 2:55:09.480]  With conventional weapons, biological weapons, you name it
[2:55:09.480 --> 2:55:13.480]  And out of this crisis the nations of the earth will come together under a tyrannical
[2:55:13.480 --> 2:55:15.480]  One World Government
[2:55:15.480 --> 2:55:19.480]  As a month ago, the Financial Times of London published by a Bilderberg group member
[2:55:19.480 --> 2:55:25.480]  Had a bunch of different articles, but one of them, and now for World Government, was the headline
[2:55:25.480 --> 2:55:29.480]  Yes, it's tyrannical, yes, it's authoritarian, yes, we kept it secret from you for your own good
[2:55:29.480 --> 2:55:33.480]  Now we're doing this to you
[2:55:33.480 --> 2:55:37.480]  And most of the followers, most of the petty elitists that think they're on the inside of this
[2:55:37.480 --> 2:55:41.480]  That think they're part of this power structure, they will be destroyed by the New World Order as well
[2:55:41.480 --> 2:55:45.480]  That's like Dr. Erick Pionka at UT here in Austin
[2:55:45.480 --> 2:55:49.480]  Says, oh, I know it's sad we all have to die, I'm sad for my family having to die
[2:55:49.480 --> 2:55:53.480]  But it's what the New World needs
[2:55:53.480 --> 2:55:57.480]  Humans are a parasite, and see out of this the new superhuman
[2:55:57.480 --> 2:56:01.480]  Can rise, and Dr. Manhattan, the god man, the new man, he understands finally
[2:56:01.480 --> 2:56:05.480]  When he talks to Lucifer, who he's been enemies with
[2:56:05.480 --> 2:56:09.480]  Never knew it was his brother, his friend, his comrade, Ozzy Mandamus
[2:56:09.480 --> 2:56:13.480]  He learns he's been fighting him all these years
[2:56:13.480 --> 2:56:17.480]  And he says, oh, I understand, I want to work with you now
[2:56:17.480 --> 2:56:21.480]  I want to be part of this with you, what you did was beautiful
[2:56:21.480 --> 2:56:25.480]  And of course Ozzy Mandamus worldwide is also blaming Dr. Manhattan
[2:56:25.480 --> 2:56:29.480]  For staging the terror attack
[2:56:29.480 --> 2:56:33.480]  And Dr. Manhattan understands that and says, yes, it's brought the world together
[2:56:33.480 --> 2:56:37.480]  Now I will leave and be a god in the universe, bye bye
[2:56:37.480 --> 2:56:41.480]  Oh, but first they had to kill Rorschach because Rorschach
[2:56:41.480 --> 2:56:45.480]  Said he was going to warn the world and tell folks who had really staged the terror attack
[2:56:45.480 --> 2:56:49.480]  He didn't understand the larger view, he couldn't grasp it, he was outside the lodge
[2:56:49.480 --> 2:56:53.480]  He was profane, he couldn't be given
[2:56:53.480 --> 2:56:57.480]  All of the greater secrets, Rorschach had to die
[2:56:57.480 --> 2:57:01.480]  And the other members of the watchmen
[2:57:01.480 --> 2:57:05.480]  They just realized, oh yes, this is good, oh, our petty minds
[2:57:05.480 --> 2:57:09.480]  We couldn't grasp all of this
[2:57:09.480 --> 2:57:13.480]  The government had to kill Kennedy
[2:57:13.480 --> 2:57:17.480]  It was good, the pyramid corporation works with the highest levels of government
[2:57:17.480 --> 2:57:21.480]  You know, they had to stage the terror attack
[2:57:21.480 --> 2:57:25.480]  And kill tens of millions of people all over the planet
[2:57:25.480 --> 2:57:29.480]  To get America and Russia together under the new pyramid corporation
[2:57:29.480 --> 2:57:33.480]  World government led by the smartest man in the world, Ozzy Mandamus
[2:57:33.480 --> 2:57:37.480]  Who did all these horrible things for the betterment of humanity
[2:57:37.480 --> 2:57:41.480]  For the betterment of society
[2:57:41.480 --> 2:57:45.480]  And so it is a open declaration
[2:57:45.480 --> 2:57:49.480]  They always must tell you what they're doing, they must always tell you why they're doing it
[2:57:49.480 --> 2:57:53.480]  And this is just, and so you have
[2:57:53.480 --> 2:57:57.480]  Tens of millions of people, billions in the aggregate over the next few years will watch this film
[2:57:57.480 --> 2:58:01.480]  And they consciously won't understand it like the reviewers of it, I don't get the ending
[2:58:01.480 --> 2:58:05.480]  But subconsciously
[2:58:05.480 --> 2:58:09.480]  People have now been told why they're going to be killed
[2:58:09.480 --> 2:58:13.480]  Why those that live are going to be so enslaved
[2:58:13.480 --> 2:58:17.480]  It's because the guardians of the future, the men who will be gods
[2:58:17.480 --> 2:58:21.480]  Through technology had to do it to make sure man
[2:58:21.480 --> 2:58:25.480]  Could go to the next level
[2:58:25.480 --> 2:58:29.480]  It's not because they're greedy and selfish or want to dominate the future and control things
[2:58:29.480 --> 2:58:33.480]  It's great goodness, no it's because they love goodness
[2:58:33.480 --> 2:58:37.480]  And they're doing it for your own good
[2:58:37.480 --> 2:58:41.480]  That's my review of Watchmen
[2:58:41.480 --> 2:58:45.480]  Stay with us
[2:58:45.480 --> 2:58:49.480]  Thank you for listening to GCN
[2:58:49.480 --> 2:58:59.480]  Hello friends, this is Alex Jones, I've told you for a long time it's important to be self-sufficient and today that's more important than ever
[2:58:59.480 --> 2:59:03.480]  We need to be independent and food and water is the key
[2:59:03.480 --> 2:59:09.480]  You'll never have to go to the superdome and beg for FEMA to take care of your family in any emergency if you simply prepare
[2:59:09.480 --> 2:59:13.480]  No one is going to take care of your family in the final equation but you
[2:59:13.480 --> 2:59:19.480]  The food is still able to shift to horrible food that's safe from E. coli, salmonella, genetic alteration, or Chinese imports
[2:59:19.480 --> 2:59:23.480]  And they do it at almost half the cost of last year's grocery prices
[2:59:23.480 --> 2:59:28.480]  Call 1-800-409-5633 or on the web go to eFoodsDirect.com
[2:59:28.480 --> 2:59:34.480]  Visit eFoodsDirect.com and look over the find list of high quality, freeze-dried and dehydrated foods they have to offer

[2:59:40.480 --> 2:59:45.480]  Again 800-409-5633 or on the web at eFoodsDirect.com
[2:59:45.480 --> 3:00:11.480]  Take action today, the first step is getting storable food
[3:00:15.480 --> 3:00:26.480]  I'm going to do 5 more minutes on the watchmen and we got a state rep fighting for sovereignty coming on
[3:00:26.480 --> 3:00:29.480]  The government kidnapped people's children
[3:00:29.480 --> 3:00:34.480]  Rob for years would tell me about the watchmen and how it was total neural order and how I should read it
[3:00:34.480 --> 3:00:37.480]  I didn't until he gave me this yesterday when I got it
[3:00:37.480 --> 3:00:41.480]  Seeing the film I knew it was pure neural or Illuminati revelation of the method
[3:00:41.480 --> 3:00:48.480]  But I saw Rob walking along here in the office and I drug him in here for this quick 5 minute segment before our next guest joins us
[3:00:48.480 --> 3:00:52.480]  Rob why don't you, number 1, pull that mic closer to you
[3:00:52.480 --> 3:00:59.480]  And number 2, give folks your quick 3 or 4 minute review of the film
[3:00:59.480 --> 3:01:08.480]  Well I mean the film was basically almost frame for frame except it watered down a little bit of the comic book
[3:01:08.480 --> 3:01:13.480]  You know it followed the comic book pretty accurately if anybody's interested in that
[3:01:13.480 --> 3:01:23.480]  But also I mean reading the comic book years ago I knew that it was loaded with all sorts of symbolism, new world order stuff
[3:01:23.480 --> 3:01:32.480]  The main character's name is Night Owl, you got a guy there with an all seeing eye on his forehead or he's drawn in an atom
[3:01:32.480 --> 3:01:36.480]  But I think it really represents an all seeing eye
[3:01:36.480 --> 3:01:38.480]  You got Alan Moore who's an admitted mation
[3:01:38.480 --> 3:01:44.480]  Yeah and he gives, I mean we saw it at the Alamo and they give Alan Moore interview beforehand
[3:01:44.480 --> 3:01:51.480]  They're just listening to it, you know just briefly the guy, you know I mean he just, the comic book's pretty cryptic
[3:01:51.480 --> 3:01:56.480]  The interview's pretty cryptic as well in Alamo Draft House
[3:01:56.480 --> 3:02:06.480]  And I mean it's just a lot of symbolism going through the book itself from, I mean it's hard to tear down
[3:02:06.480 --> 3:02:10.480]  Well the main message is, well sure you're so talking until you get on air
[3:02:10.480 --> 3:02:15.480]  The main message here is that false flag terrorism is being done for your own good
[3:02:15.480 --> 3:02:20.480]  It's a beautiful wonderful thing and the good guys at the end go yes let's terror attacks are good
[3:02:20.480 --> 3:02:22.480]  It was good to kill all these millions of people
[3:02:22.480 --> 3:02:27.480]  It was for our own, you know best interest in Rorschach, the guy who says no to it, he's the bad guy
[3:02:27.480 --> 3:02:32.480]  Right exactly, he's the one who's made out to be like a psychopath, he's unstable
[3:02:32.480 --> 3:02:37.480]  He's the one who's trying to get down to the bottom of things in the movie
[3:02:37.480 --> 3:02:41.480]  You know he's the investigator but he has psycho problems
[3:02:41.480 --> 3:02:45.480]  And the other guy who is the gentle, you know giant over there
[3:02:45.480 --> 3:02:50.480]  He's like I'll just give up on humanity, what do I even care about this anymore
[3:02:50.480 --> 3:02:57.480]  This planet doesn't interest me and he's the gentle, you know, next evolved person
[3:02:57.480 --> 3:03:02.480]  And when you read the writings that we put in Endgame of all the top futurists they say similar things
[3:03:02.480 --> 3:03:05.480]  You know they write about it and why the future doesn't need us
[3:03:05.480 --> 3:03:08.480]  You know Bill Joy and Wired Magazine about how he goes to elite conferences
[3:03:08.480 --> 3:03:12.480]  They talk about how the new man's about to form, they're going to kill the majority of us
[3:03:12.480 --> 3:03:15.480]  And he doesn't know if that's a good idea
[3:03:15.480 --> 3:03:21.480]  Or watching, for example, the Riddles and Stone or something like that
[3:03:21.480 --> 3:03:29.480]  They talk about how the masons believe in a perfected human and it seems like this would be kind of similar to that as well
[3:03:29.480 --> 3:03:35.480]  This perfected human, next evolved human that will just leave the earth
[3:03:35.480 --> 3:03:40.480]  You know they could see through time and space and whatever
[3:03:40.480 --> 3:03:44.480]  But it's important but there has to be a sacrifice
[3:03:44.480 --> 3:03:49.480]  That's on there, movie posters as there had to be a sacrifice
[3:03:49.480 --> 3:03:54.480]  This was done for your own good to bring in world government under the Pyramid Corporation
[3:03:54.480 --> 3:04:00.480]  Exactly, exactly, I mean that's the underlying plot of the film is that this guy
[3:04:00.480 --> 3:04:11.480]  He basically is being paid to, you know, get rid of knock off these mass superheroes and stage a bunch of false terror events in the cities
[3:04:11.480 --> 3:04:15.480]  Well it's just amazing that the media then says we don't get it, we don't understand it
[3:04:15.480 --> 3:04:21.480]  I think most of the media does understand it, they're just not ready to tell the slaves what the film not even really means
[3:04:21.480 --> 3:04:29.480]  It's stated in clear, you know, on the silver screen that good guy stage terror attacks bring in world government, the Illuminati's good and we love you
[3:04:29.480 --> 3:04:36.480]  Exactly, exactly, and when, I mean, it's loaded with symbolism, you know, up and down
[3:04:36.480 --> 3:04:41.480]  Just like the comic book was, every single character is representation
[3:04:41.480 --> 3:04:47.480]  I mean, I'm myself, I don't know of all the Masonic symbols and all these things, I'm only lightly like them
[3:04:47.480 --> 3:04:49.480]  The women are the goddesses, all of it
[3:04:49.480 --> 3:05:07.480]  Hey, Rob, thanks for being here with us, we're gonna come right back, stay with us
[3:05:19.480 --> 3:05:26.480]  And thanks for being here with us, we're gonna come right back
[3:05:49.480 --> 3:06:01.480]  So don't delay, call today, 908-691-2608 and see what our powder seeds and oil can do for you
[3:06:01.480 --> 3:06:08.480]  A day unlike any other in the long course of American history, a terrorist act of war against this country
[3:06:08.480 --> 3:06:12.480]  The enemy struck America on September 11th, but who is the enemy?
[3:06:12.480 --> 3:06:13.480]  Bin Laden
[3:06:13.480 --> 3:06:14.480]  This is his MO
[3:06:14.480 --> 3:06:17.480]  We have to look to the Middle East, we have to look to his home of Bin Laden
[3:06:17.480 --> 3:06:24.480]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside the United States
[3:06:24.480 --> 3:06:31.480]  Some US investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the US
[3:06:31.480 --> 3:06:35.480]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained
[3:06:35.480 --> 3:06:42.480]  Bin Laden's connections to the CIA, the hijackers' ties to the FBI, the Saudi Arabian connection, the Israeli intelligence network
[3:06:42.480 --> 3:06:47.480]  Warnings and war games, the shadow government, and much much more, fabled enemies

[3:07:41.480 --> 3:08:09.480]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents The Alex Jones Show, because there's a war on for your mind
[3:08:12.480 --> 3:08:21.480]  All right, for this single segment we have Representative Dennis Richardson of Oregon, who has introduced the bill
[3:08:21.480 --> 3:08:30.480]  HJM17 in Oregon, who declared 10th Amendment sovereignty, which the states already have, but it's important to restate that
[3:08:30.480 --> 3:08:36.480]  Some states are passing this, other states aren't, New Hampshire was narrowly defeated, sadly, last week
[3:08:36.480 --> 3:08:42.480]  But the point is, the rediscovery of the 9th and 10th Amendment is happening, that the states created the federal government
[3:08:42.480 --> 3:08:48.480]  The federal government isn't allowed to hand over all our sovereignty to foreign corporations or groups, or the UN
[3:08:48.480 --> 3:08:52.480]  The feds aren't allowed to come in with unfunded mandates and boss the states around
[3:08:52.480 --> 3:08:57.480]  And so that's why we're continuing every week to have a couple state reps on from these different states
[3:08:57.480 --> 3:09:06.480]  Like Representative Dennis Richardson of Oregon, who's introduced HJM17, and I have a copy of that resolution up on infowars.com for folks that want to see it
[3:09:06.480 --> 3:09:08.480]  Sir, thank you for coming on with us today
[3:09:08.480 --> 3:09:10.480]  It's a pleasure to be with you
[3:09:10.480 --> 3:09:19.480]  Okay, in the 10 or 12 minutes we've got with you, break down why you've done this, why it's important and how folks can get behind this resolution there in Oregon
[3:09:19.480 --> 3:09:28.480]  Well, what we have in the country of the last couple of decades, especially, is the federal government has been treating the states as if we were subordinate to them
[3:09:28.480 --> 3:09:36.480]  Like the states are branches of the federal government, and that's just basic intimidation, and it should not continue
[3:09:36.480 --> 3:09:44.480]  We have federal ID, which has been hoisted upon the people without even debating the Senate
[3:09:44.480 --> 3:09:53.480]  And it basically says we're going to have a national ID card, it's going to cost billions of dollars to implement, and it's an unfunded mandate without protection of our documents
[3:09:53.480 --> 3:10:03.480]  We have continuing redeployments of the National Guard to foreign lands to fight foreign wars as if they were an additional branch of the military
[3:10:03.480 --> 3:10:08.480]  That is unconstitutional based on the original constitution
[3:10:08.480 --> 3:10:20.480]  We need to help assure that the federal government understands that they're given enumerated rights, and that the rights that they are not specifically given remain with the states and with the people
[3:10:20.480 --> 3:10:24.480]  That's what the 10th Amendment guarantees
[3:10:24.480 --> 3:10:39.480]  Well, I'm sure you know under Northcom without an act of Congress, the Pentagon is announcing they're fully federalizing and absorbing the state guards, and the governors they say will serve under PDD 51 and others
[3:10:39.480 --> 3:10:50.480]  Other presidential directives at the pleasure of the president and that Congress is ceremonial now during emergencies, including economic or any other emergency
[3:10:50.480 --> 3:11:03.480]  That is open dictatorship. We've had the federal Congress threatened with physical martial law according to senators and congressmen that we have interviewed and have been on record saying they were threatened with martial law by the White House if they didn't pass the
[3:11:03.480 --> 3:11:06.480]  Banker bailout bill of October 3
[3:11:06.480 --> 3:11:12.480]  That's absolutely right. That occurred and we should be shocked. I mean, we must take action before we lose our nation
[3:11:12.480 --> 3:11:25.480]  This is 50 United States that has joined together and created the federal government. We did not plan the federal government having a praetorian guard or to be able to intimidate the states to do whatever they want
[3:11:25.480 --> 3:11:39.480]  In many ways, they've done it through money by getting the states so committed to obtaining federal funds. Of course, the federal funds are funds that come from the states, you know, people that live in states and their wallets and bank accounts
[3:11:39.480 --> 3:11:51.480]  But unless there's some change that takes place in the way we, the people, accept the government and the power that's being imposed upon us, we're going to just get more of the same
[3:11:51.480 --> 3:12:01.480]  Well, sir, as you know, history has shown that every time you allow a central government to do whatever it wants, it always creates a tyranny
[3:12:01.480 --> 3:12:17.480]  That is the law of governments and of how humans operate. So people shouldn't be surprised that a classical tyranny is now forming with gun confiscation bills, gun registration bills introduced with national civilian workforces, FEMA camps all over the news
[3:12:17.480 --> 3:12:33.480]  Being built for our own good in quotes. Can you specifically speak to as a representative what it's like witnessing this unfold? A, and then B, how much support are you getting? Is it bipartisan? What is the sense of your legislature? Are they becoming educated?
[3:12:33.480 --> 3:12:51.480]  Well, I think that it's going to be doubtful that this will make it all the way through the Oregon legislature. I don't feel that the Democrats who are in charge of Oregon's House and Senate fully see the importance in the emergency that I see and that I feel exists across our country
[3:12:51.480 --> 3:13:09.480]  I'm trying very much to get this to be a bipartisan bill. We have a few Democrats that have signed on it. One is co-sponsoring it with me, but to see if it's going to be able to get through the House, the Senate and signed by, or the House and the Senate since it's a memorial, it's going to be a different question
[3:13:09.480 --> 3:13:30.480]  Well, resistance is not futile, and the fact that some states are passing it, many others, now more than 30 introducing it, does show it's an education process, and as things worsen and as the tyranny becomes more and more obvious, I think this is a very important first step in people realizing the solution is the states declaring their inherent sovereignty
[3:13:30.480 --> 3:13:55.480]  Absolutely. We need to impress upon Congress the importance of restoring the balance of power. Congress has relinquished to the executive branch of our country far too much power, and they can take it back if they're willing to stand up and show the courage to reimplement and to rededicate ourselves to the constitutional provisions which were designed to keep us from falling into a tyranny
[3:13:55.480 --> 3:14:10.480]  What do the other state reps in Oregon say, because I've been asking all the state reps that have been on this, some say everybody's waking up, others say some are waking up, others say hardly anybody is realizing it. I mean, you go to them and say, did you know they've signed directives that the federal Congress is ceremonial?
[3:14:10.480 --> 3:14:20.480]  Do you know they're building FEMA camps? Do you know they're federalizing the Guard? Do you know the Army saying North Com's going to put troops in every city? Do you understand that we're going into a classical tyranny?
[3:14:20.480 --> 3:14:26.480]  I mean, so first off, do you say that to them and B, what do they say when you try to warn them?
[3:14:26.480 --> 3:14:39.480]  Actually, I don't go into that kind of detail. It is not so widely known. I mean, I read a lot and I try and understand it, but it is not clearly understood how serious the problem is.
[3:14:39.480 --> 3:14:56.480]  There's not a sense of emergency. I mean, some are asking, you know, some make things happen, some watch things happen, some say, you know, what happened? And that's where we're at right now. Most people are still not even seeing the sense of urgency that we should all be feeling.
[3:14:56.480 --> 3:15:11.480]  Well, that's the good news, though, is that it was a minority. 2% started the war, 5% won the war. The rest sat on the bench in 1776 through 1784, 85. And so it doesn't take a majority to win.
[3:15:11.480 --> 3:15:20.480]  Most people are on the fence. They're in the bleachers. They don't know which end is up. They're in La La Land. You've got the bad guys on one team and the good guys on another.
[3:15:20.480 --> 3:15:34.480]  There are more good guys than there are bad guys. We just have to get into positions of power at the county, city, state and federal level, and we have to spread the word about what's really happening so that as the system unfolds, people will then understand what's happened.
[3:15:34.480 --> 3:15:58.480]  Well, that's true. I mean, it's about educating the people to the situation in which they find themselves because you're not going to get it from the media and you don't get it from the normal channels of information. It's got to come for the internet and from individuals that are willing to get together and take the commitment, make the commitment that they're going to be a part of a solution before it becomes too late.
[3:15:58.480 --> 3:16:13.480]  To do that, people have to face the full severity. I mean, they have to realize this isn't just some boss hog corrupt federal government with some pork barrel. They are hiring the preachers covertly to tell their flocks to hand in their guns and go to FEMA camps and now declassified on record.
[3:16:13.480 --> 3:16:27.480]  They've hired 50,000 InfraGuard corporate executives with shoot to kill orders. They are federalizing, putting federal surveillance cameras up everywhere. I mean, a nightmare control grid is going into place so the foreign banks can loot this nation.
[3:16:27.480 --> 3:16:32.480]  People need to understand that we are being treated like a third world country. We are being imploded right now.
[3:16:32.480 --> 3:16:38.480]  And that's true. We are. We can become a third world country if we're not careful.
[3:16:38.480 --> 3:16:56.480]  So what can we do to help get this bill passed or to put pressure on the Oregon legislature to give them a crass course in education? I mean, if it's in session right now, people could print up the news articles about the FEMA camps, PED 51, about Bush was trying to set up a dictatorship, Obama's continuing it, the White House memos about banning free speech.
[3:16:56.480 --> 3:17:03.480]  I mean, can't listeners go physically to the capital and try to have meetings with their state reps? I mean, isn't that even better than phone calls?
[3:17:03.480 --> 3:17:20.480]  Absolutely. When people actually show up, it makes a big difference. I mean, you have the teachers show up when they have work-in-service days. You have advocates for different programs. They come, but the common person rarely really shows up here because they're working, trying to make a living, trying to make ends meet.
[3:17:20.480 --> 3:17:21.480]  But it does help.
[3:17:21.480 --> 3:17:29.480]  You know, I've talked to so many successful people in business and art and life, and they say just showing up is half the battle. The American people need to just show up, don't they?
[3:17:29.480 --> 3:17:34.480]  It's the first step of leadership is to be there, to have your voice heard.
[3:17:34.480 --> 3:17:40.480]  Absolutely, folks. You're not going to say the world by yourselves, but showing up is half the battle.
[3:17:40.480 --> 3:17:41.480]  Specifically...
[3:17:41.480 --> 3:17:58.480]  There is something that could be done also, and that is to send emails. I mean, you know, that does help to have pressure be felt. I have a series of newsletters that I send out, and there's one of them actually has the list of all the emails for the senators, the governor,
[3:17:58.480 --> 3:18:10.480]  and the representatives in the state of Oregon, and that's at DennisRichardson.org, and just click on emails or newsletters and go to the February 13th edition.
[3:18:10.480 --> 3:18:19.480]  Absolutely. DennisRichardson.org. We have that up on screen right now at prisonplanet.tv. In the minute and a half we have left, sir, any other points you'd like to add?
[3:18:19.480 --> 3:18:29.480]  Only that if we want to maintain our nation, we cannot continue to just sit and, you know, sit on our hands and watch what's going on and say, wow, this is amazing.
[3:18:29.480 --> 3:18:36.480]  I mean, who's going to pay back this $1.2 trillion? Who's going to ask the hard questions?
[3:18:36.480 --> 3:18:44.480]  We must not let those that are in power go unchallenged. I mean, grassroots is important.
[3:18:44.480 --> 3:19:00.480]  We must hold to the fire the feet of those who we've elected to step forward, to speak for the Constitution, to reinstate the principles that rarely are considered in legislation either at the state or the federal level any longer.
[3:19:00.480 --> 3:19:10.480]  Wow. Well, whoever's got you representing them in Oregon is certainly blessed. Representative DennisRichardson.org. What area do you represent there in Oregon?
[3:19:10.480 --> 3:19:22.480]  I represent Oregon between Medford and Grant's Pass. It's kind of a rural district, but actually I represent all of Oregon because Oregon is a great state. It just has leadership that have lost their vision.
[3:19:22.480 --> 3:19:25.480]  Well, I've been to your area. It is gorgeous.
[3:19:25.480 --> 3:19:30.480]  And let me say it's DennisRichardson so that people can find it. It's S-O-N at the end.
[3:19:30.480 --> 3:19:43.480]  DennisRichardson.org. Representative DennisRichardson. Thank you so much. And as this develops, I'd like to get back in touch with you and get an update. Godspeed.
[3:19:43.480 --> 3:19:45.480]  That's great. And keep up the great work.
[3:19:45.480 --> 3:19:52.480]  Representative DennisRichardson. All right. We will be right back, ladies and gentlemen, after this quick break.
[3:19:52.480 --> 3:20:01.480]  Be sure if you live in Oregon or anywhere in the country to support Representative DennisRichardson at DennisRichardson.org.

[3:21:01.480 --> 3:21:09.480]  May I have everyone's attention, please? I've come with a message of information. 9-11 was an inside job.
[3:21:09.480 --> 3:21:14.480]  Do you like being a puppet, sir? Do you like being a puppet from the New World Order?
[3:21:14.480 --> 3:21:21.480]  How do the American people know that 9-11 was a stage? It was engineered by you, David Rockefeller, the Thrallateral Commission, the CAFAR.
[3:21:21.480 --> 3:21:28.480]  The day that we stop asking questions is the day that we have allowed the seeds of despotism to grow at our own door.
[3:21:28.480 --> 3:21:34.480]  Seven years after the attacks of September 11, a global awakening has taken place.
[3:21:34.480 --> 3:21:39.480]  An inside job? How dare you?
[3:21:39.480 --> 3:21:44.480]  If you know that there's treason going on, you can be held accountable for treason yourself.
[3:21:44.480 --> 3:21:47.480]  All hell is breaking loose on 6th Avenue.
[3:21:47.480 --> 3:21:53.480]  And if the government has not told the truth in five years, we will be here on the 10th anniversary of 9-11.
[3:21:53.480 --> 3:21:59.480]  Please rise. Download the film at prisonplanet.tv right now or get the DVD at infowars.com.
[3:21:59.480 --> 3:22:02.480]  It's now time to take the revolution to the next level.
[3:22:02.480 --> 3:22:06.480]  Hello, this is Peter Cronch Novel from Midos Resources and I'd like to share some thoughts with you.
[3:22:06.480 --> 3:22:14.480]  In today's economy, with the government spending on wild, the banking system on the verge of collapse, and Wall Street and continuous freefall,
[3:22:14.480 --> 3:22:19.480]  we both know that it's critical that you protect your savings and retirement programs now.
[3:22:19.480 --> 3:22:24.480]  Macroeconomics can be very confusing, but the solution to securing your personal assets is very simple.
[3:22:24.480 --> 3:22:26.480]  It's purchase of gold and silver.
[3:22:26.480 --> 3:22:33.480]  These precious metals have been the trusted means of exchange for centuries, and they've never been more important in our country's history.
[3:22:33.480 --> 3:22:37.480]  It's up to you to design your survival plan, one based on gold and silver.
[3:22:37.480 --> 3:22:43.480]  Give me a call. I'm Peter Cronch Novel at 800-686-2237, extension 108.
[3:22:43.480 --> 3:22:47.480]  And allow me to outline an easy answer to your questions.
[3:22:47.480 --> 3:23:00.480]  That's Peter Cronch Novel at 1800-686-2237, extension 108. Call Peter at 1800-686-2237, extension 108, while you can still purchase gold with paper.
[3:23:03.480 --> 3:23:08.480]  It's a new year full of uncertainties. People are being laid off in record numbers.
[3:23:08.480 --> 3:23:13.480]  The price of food continues to rise and the economy continues to falter.
[3:23:13.480 --> 3:23:19.480]  You know that you need to prepare, and maybe you've been putting it off, but the time to act is now.
[3:23:19.480 --> 3:23:22.480]  That's why you need to visit OrganicaSeed.com.
[3:23:22.480 --> 3:23:29.480]  At OrganicaSeed.com, you'll find one of the largest online selections of heirloom seeds and survival seed packs,

[3:24:05.480 --> 3:24:15.480]  You know, a point I don't make enough on air that I think about constantly is the United States as 4% of the world's population.
[3:24:15.480 --> 3:24:23.480]  But we had more than half the world's wealth. Now most of that's been stolen.
[3:24:23.480 --> 3:24:30.480]  Why? A small amount of the land geographically in the world, a small amount of people, and we weren't perfect,
[3:24:30.480 --> 3:24:38.480]  but we did follow biblical systems that cut back on corruption that allowed free market to flourish, and we were the apple of the world's eye.
[3:24:38.480 --> 3:24:44.480]  So the globalists came here, took over the nation, set up shop, used the United States to set up their world government.
[3:24:44.480 --> 3:24:48.480]  Now they're done with us. They're going to make us just one more bankrupt third-world country.
[3:24:48.480 --> 3:24:55.480]  South Africa's got roughly twice the resources we have in every level, but they're in total squalor and it's all falling apart.
[3:24:55.480 --> 3:25:00.480]  Mexico has three times the natural resources on every level.
[3:25:00.480 --> 3:25:06.480]  Timber, oil, fertile land, you know, volcanic soil, copper, everything.
[3:25:06.480 --> 3:25:16.480]  They're smart people, but the elite keep everybody on the plantations, keep them in poverty as a tool of control. This is done over and over and over again throughout society.
[3:25:16.480 --> 3:25:21.480]  The elites don't want a free market. They don't want you doing well. They don't want you independent. They don't want you to have a family.
[3:25:21.480 --> 3:25:26.480]  How many government documents, Department of Education, have I read, and the textbooks they give their social workers,
[3:25:26.480 --> 3:25:34.480]  that the family's bad and arcane and primitive and must be broken down, must be destroyed for the new mega-wonder state to rise,
[3:25:34.480 --> 3:25:38.480]  and the people owe their allegiance to the state, and then the state's controlled by these eugenicists
[3:25:38.480 --> 3:25:43.480]  who want to use the state to reduce our numbers one-child policy control us.
[3:25:43.480 --> 3:25:49.480]  You know, there was an article in The New York Times today about Obama during a press conference last week.
[3:25:49.480 --> 3:25:55.480]  They said, are you a socialist? And he said, I'm not going to answer that. That's, you know, and then he kind of freaked out afterwards
[3:25:55.480 --> 3:25:59.480]  and called The New York Times and called some other papers and said, listen, I want to answer that.
[3:25:59.480 --> 3:26:04.480]  I was kind of taken back and didn't answer it because it was so ridiculous. I'm not a socialist.
[3:26:04.480 --> 3:26:10.480]  And in truth, he's not. You know, in the classical sense, taking tens of trillions, it's tens of trillions of dollars,
[3:26:10.480 --> 3:26:15.480]  and if you gave it to the people and stole it from the middle class and the rich, that would be socialism.
[3:26:15.480 --> 3:26:22.480]  But really, it's the ultra-rich, as they always do, robbing the middle class and telling the poor the middle class is the elite.
[3:26:22.480 --> 3:26:29.480]  The elite always use the poor as their weapon, pressure from above and pressure from below to consolidate, to destroy the middle class,
[3:26:29.480 --> 3:26:37.480]  to destroy independent wealth. And then they turn the middle class into a giant underclass and continue playing the poor, uneducated, ignorant
[3:26:37.480 --> 3:26:44.480]  underclass against what's left of the middle class, and it kills the goose that lays the golden egg and hurts the working class
[3:26:44.480 --> 3:26:51.480]  so they can't now rise into the middle class, but they don't know that because they're not educated on the way the world works in history.
[3:26:51.480 --> 3:26:58.480]  And so that's what's happening right now. Our society is being vertically integrated.
[3:26:58.480 --> 3:27:07.480]  It's being consolidated. The middle class is being destroyed. The engines of free market and upward mobility are being destroyed
[3:27:07.480 --> 3:27:13.480]  systematically by the elite so that they will have no bad sons to contend with. What's a bad son?
[3:27:13.480 --> 3:27:18.480]  It's the little trees that grow up under a bigger oak tree, and they go in and they cut down the bad sons,
[3:27:18.480 --> 3:27:22.480]  so none of those grow up to be a mighty oak and rival the elite. It's survival of the fittest.
[3:27:22.480 --> 3:27:30.480]  Why does a grizzly bear male go and smell the cubs, the pups, that a mother bear has had?
[3:27:30.480 --> 3:27:38.480]  Polar bears do this too. It'll go and smell, and when it smells the male, it will kill it because he knows that's going to be competition
[3:27:38.480 --> 3:27:44.480]  against his dominance later. Male grizzly bears will even kill their own sons.
[3:27:44.480 --> 3:27:53.480]  Some species of whale will try to kill other baby whales. Polar bears do it. Wolves will go in and kill other babies.
[3:27:53.480 --> 3:28:02.480]  Lions do it. Tigers do it. This is done over and over and over and over again. That's what the elite are doing.
[3:28:02.480 --> 3:28:07.480]  They are engaged in predatory actions. Their own documents admit that they're putting leadership males.
[3:28:07.480 --> 3:28:13.480]  Males that show leadership qualities of interrupting, fighting, speaking up, always raising their hand.
[3:28:13.480 --> 3:28:18.480]  That is a leadership model. They want to drug them. They want to burn their brains out.
[3:28:18.480 --> 3:28:23.480]  They want to say that that's bad, and it isn't just people saying, oh, they want to target the males.
[3:28:23.480 --> 3:28:27.480]  It's in their documents. We've had former head of policy department of education on.
[3:28:27.480 --> 3:28:32.480]  We've had top people winning all these awards for education, like John Taylor Gatto won.
[3:28:32.480 --> 3:28:38.480]  This is in the government documents. We sell the deliberate dumbing down by Charlotte Isherby the size of a phone book,
[3:28:38.480 --> 3:28:43.480]  the size of an Austin phone book. It's not a Dallas phone book. A Dallas phone book is that big.
[3:28:43.480 --> 3:28:48.480]  The Austin phone book is that big. It's that thick full of government documents. Every time I mention on air,
[3:28:48.480 --> 3:28:51.480]  the government's own documents say they want to dump people down to break up the family.
[3:28:51.480 --> 3:28:57.480]  People don't believe me. So we have guest on and we post on the forum hundreds of government documents and quotes where they want to do this.
[3:28:57.480 --> 3:29:03.480]  This is predatory. This is evil. This is wrong. And we have to face the horror they want to break up the family.
[3:29:03.480 --> 3:29:09.480]  We have to face the horror they want to inoculate us with HIV and cancer virus filled vaccines.
[3:29:09.480 --> 3:29:16.480]  We have to face the horror and face the reality that we have a predator psychopathic New World Order group in control
[3:29:16.480 --> 3:29:24.480]  who love to brag and love to show off about what they're going to do to us through the popular culture and the media.
[3:29:24.480 --> 3:29:30.480]  It is their religion. It is their modus operandi. It is their thought pattern. It is their signature.
[3:29:30.480 --> 3:29:34.480]  It is their way.
[3:29:34.480 --> 3:29:38.480]  We're going to come back here and talk to Greg Pound about the kidnapping of the children for not taking vaccines.
[3:29:38.480 --> 3:29:45.480]  Don't forget, the Obama deception is on sale now and it comes out at prisonplanet.tv this Sunday at 6pm.
[3:29:45.480 --> 3:29:51.480]  Order the DVD at infowars.com. Stay with us.
[3:29:51.480 --> 3:29:55.480]  We're on the march. The empire's on the run.
[3:29:55.480 --> 3:30:01.480]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network
[3:30:01.480 --> 3:30:05.480]  More than 700 chemicals have been found in our drinking water.
[3:30:05.480 --> 3:30:10.480]  And did you know that you have greater exposure to these chemicals while taking hot showers than when drinking the water?
[3:30:10.480 --> 3:30:15.480]  That's because many chemicals are inhaled when they evaporate and others are absorbed into the skin.
[3:30:15.480 --> 3:30:27.480]  The KDF dual media shower filter works with both hot and cold water and is designed to reduce chlorine, lead, mercury and iron and it inhibits the growth of bacteria, mold, algae and fungus.
[3:30:27.480 --> 3:30:33.480]  The KDF dual media shower filter typically lasts 10,000 gallons or one year whichever comes first.
[3:30:33.480 --> 3:30:39.480]  Hospitals, restaurants and water treatment facilities use this media to reduce chlorine, iron, heavy metals and bacteria.
[3:30:39.480 --> 3:30:46.480]  What about you? Order your KDF shower filter normally $49 for a special price of only $39.99 with free shipping.

[3:31:01.480 --> 3:31:08.480]  A day unlike any other in the long course of American history, a terrorist act of war against this country.
[3:31:08.480 --> 3:31:12.480]  The enemy struck America on September 11th. But who is the enemy?
[3:31:12.480 --> 3:31:14.480]  Bin Laden. This is his MO.
[3:31:14.480 --> 3:31:17.480]  We have to look to the Middle East. We have to look to Osama Bin Laden.
[3:31:17.480 --> 3:31:24.480]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside the United States.
[3:31:24.480 --> 3:31:31.480]  Some U.S. investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S.
[3:31:31.480 --> 3:31:35.480]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[3:31:35.480 --> 3:31:42.480]  Bin Laden's connections to the CIA, the hijackers ties to the FBI, the Saudi Arabian connection, the Israeli intelligence network,
[3:31:42.480 --> 3:31:46.480]  warnings in war games, the shadow government and much, much more. Fabled Enemies.

[3:32:01.480 --> 3:32:07.480]  Did you know that pH balance is one of the most important factors in maintaining high energy and vibrant health?
[3:32:07.480 --> 3:32:12.480]  Most experts agree that the water you drink should be at a pH level of 9 or higher.
[3:32:12.480 --> 3:32:17.480]  Plasma pH drops combine a unique formula of the most alkaline minerals and elements.
[3:32:17.480 --> 3:32:21.480]  This product is a one-of-a-kind in its strength and effectiveness.
[3:32:21.480 --> 3:32:31.480]  Using plasma pH drops is one of the best ways to make your water alkaline while helping you get rid of acid and regaining your health and energy.
[3:32:31.480 --> 3:32:36.480]  With just 10 drops, you can raise the pH level of the water you drink up to the pH of 10.
[3:32:36.480 --> 3:32:42.480]  Alkalizing water helps the body rid itself of acidic waste and increases the oxygen content of your body.
[3:32:42.480 --> 3:32:47.480]  Disease organisms like bacteria and cancer cannot survive in an alkaline environment.

[3:33:17.480 --> 3:33:23.480]  Greg Pound does great work at FreeOurKids.com and FreeOurChildren.com.
[3:33:23.480 --> 3:33:30.480]  He calls up every week talking to the producer and he told me today and everything he's always told me turned out to be documented
[3:33:30.480 --> 3:33:35.480]  that he wanted to come on about CPS grabbing people's children for not being vaccinated.
[3:33:35.480 --> 3:33:39.480]  And I've seen mainstream articles about that and I wanted to talk about that.
[3:33:39.480 --> 3:33:51.480]  And he said, no, I've got guests on from the Tony Olamo or Alamo Ministries and I'm familiar with how they've been persecuted
[3:33:51.480 --> 3:33:56.480]  and I've studied the case because listeners have sent me the news clips and articles for about a year.
[3:33:56.480 --> 3:33:59.480]  I've been researching and even thought about getting Tony Alamo on.
[3:33:59.480 --> 3:34:07.480]  It's been quite a witch hunt against this guy because people don't like politically what he's covering and what he's doing.
[3:34:07.480 --> 3:34:14.480]  But I'm a little bit off-kilter here because he's got several people on the line with him,
[3:34:14.480 --> 3:34:18.480]  Angela Morales and others, so I'm just not up to date specifically with their cases.
[3:34:18.480 --> 3:34:20.480]  We're going to go to him in just one moment.
[3:34:20.480 --> 3:34:25.480]  Before we do that, I want to tell you about the sponsors that make this radio show possible.
[3:34:25.480 --> 3:34:30.480]  And one of them is MySolarBackup.com from the great folks at Solution from Science.
[3:34:30.480 --> 3:34:34.480]  It's an 1,800 watts of power on demand in the event of any disaster or outage.

[3:34:38.480 --> 3:34:42.480]  and a high efficiency solar panel designed to provide endless electricity.
[3:34:42.480 --> 3:34:45.480]  The solar generator is like having a silent power plant hidden in your home.
[3:34:45.480 --> 3:34:47.480]  It's the perfect emergency backup for troubled times.
[3:34:47.480 --> 3:34:51.480]  The government doesn't own the sun folks yet, so make your move now.

[3:34:58.480 --> 3:35:04.480]  That's 877-327-0365MySolarBackup.com.
[3:35:04.480 --> 3:35:07.480]  Another fine sponsor is survivalistseeds.com.

[3:35:12.480 --> 3:35:13.480]  and break free of the New World Order.
[3:35:13.480 --> 3:35:17.480]  Our sponsor, Survivalist Seeds, has now drastically reduced their price
[3:35:17.480 --> 3:35:20.480]  on heirloomseeds at survivalistseeds.com.
[3:35:20.480 --> 3:35:25.480]  They now sell 6,000 rare heirloom seeds from 20 varieties for only $108.
[3:35:25.480 --> 3:35:27.480]  Great deal, huge pack.
[3:35:27.480 --> 3:35:30.480]  There's also a real heirloom seed shortage right now,
[3:35:30.480 --> 3:35:32.480]  so people interested in growing their own food supply,
[3:35:32.480 --> 3:35:34.480]  and it's a growing season, just now starting,
[3:35:34.480 --> 3:35:38.480]  need to get their heirloom seeds now and start their victory gardens this spring.

[3:35:47.480 --> 3:35:49.480]  Also, we talked to him earlier in the show,
[3:35:49.480 --> 3:35:52.480]  the great folks at a coloblue, a coloblue.com
[3:35:52.480 --> 3:35:54.480]  atmospheric water generator for your home,
[3:35:54.480 --> 3:35:57.480]  it's for itself in one year if you buy your water from the store,
[3:35:57.480 --> 3:35:59.480]  pure clean water without the fluoride,

[3:36:01.480 --> 3:36:03.480]  machine produces up to 7.5 gallons a day.
[3:36:03.480 --> 3:36:05.480]  That's just one of their small machines, they have bigger ones.

[3:36:17.480 --> 3:36:25.480]  Coloblue.com, or 800-691-6043, 800-691-6043.
[3:36:25.480 --> 3:36:29.480]  Now, Greg, there's always so much going on
[3:36:29.480 --> 3:36:31.480]  because you had your children kidnapped,
[3:36:31.480 --> 3:36:33.480]  and I got the mainstream articles,
[3:36:33.480 --> 3:36:36.480]  the lady that did it lost her CPS license
[3:36:36.480 --> 3:36:38.480]  because she admittedly falsified evidence,
[3:36:38.480 --> 3:36:40.480]  they don't care, you don't get your children back,
[3:36:40.480 --> 3:36:42.480]  now your wife had another baby, she's in hiding,
[3:36:42.480 --> 3:36:44.480]  so they can't get the baby, haven't seen the baby in a few years.
[3:36:44.480 --> 3:36:46.480]  Just recapping for listeners, you had told my producer,
[3:36:46.480 --> 3:36:48.480]  you were coming on about them kidnapping children
[3:36:48.480 --> 3:36:50.480]  for not being vaccinated.
[3:36:50.480 --> 3:36:52.480]  Is that specifically what we're talking about right now?
[3:36:52.480 --> 3:36:55.480]  Well, the thing is, is this alamo-ministries.com
[3:36:55.480 --> 3:36:59.480]  is basically, I mean, they do their studying,
[3:36:59.480 --> 3:37:02.480]  and we know as parents that these immunizations
[3:37:02.480 --> 3:37:04.480]  aren't the best thing for our children.
[3:37:04.480 --> 3:37:06.480]  Okay, specifically then, I hadn't found out which group this was.
[3:37:06.480 --> 3:37:08.480]  I remember reading that they were going after them
[3:37:08.480 --> 3:37:10.480]  for not immunizing when there's no rules.
[3:37:10.480 --> 3:37:12.480]  They tried to take Charlie Sheen's children,
[3:37:12.480 --> 3:37:14.480]  that was in the LA Times
[3:37:14.480 --> 3:37:16.480]  because he doesn't vaccinate,
[3:37:16.480 --> 3:37:18.480]  so yes, we know this is going on.
[3:37:18.480 --> 3:37:21.480]  Specifically though, people can say whatever they want
[3:37:21.480 --> 3:37:23.480]  about Tony Alamo and his ministries,
[3:37:23.480 --> 3:37:25.480]  I have looked at the case after case,
[3:37:25.480 --> 3:37:28.480]  they put him in prison for tax evasion, made up,
[3:37:28.480 --> 3:37:30.480]  they're always sending SWAT teams in,
[3:37:30.480 --> 3:37:32.480]  trying to tell, get people to say
[3:37:32.480 --> 3:37:35.480]  that bad things have happened to him, more lies,
[3:37:35.480 --> 3:37:39.480]  so I can vouch for that, but what else is going on?
[3:37:39.480 --> 3:37:41.480]  Well, the thing is, is now they've got a pickup order
[3:37:41.480 --> 3:37:43.480]  for 120 little children,
[3:37:43.480 --> 3:37:45.480]  they've taken 37 children.
[3:37:45.480 --> 3:37:47.480]  Now, what they did is they put a gag order
[3:37:47.480 --> 3:37:50.480]  on the whole church that if they speak about this to the news,
[3:37:50.480 --> 3:37:52.480]  they're going to end up in jail.
[3:37:52.480 --> 3:37:56.480]  Now, can you imagine such a thing that they can come in
[3:37:56.480 --> 3:37:59.480]  and tell, if you look how big this ministry is,
[3:37:59.480 --> 3:38:01.480]  I mean, it's a huge ministry,
[3:38:01.480 --> 3:38:04.480]  and telling the people that if you talk to the news,
[3:38:04.480 --> 3:38:06.480]  you're going to be put in jail.
[3:38:06.480 --> 3:38:08.480]  Okay, specifically though, with this case,
[3:38:08.480 --> 3:38:10.480]  they're claiming they haven't vaccinated
[3:38:10.480 --> 3:38:12.480]  and that's one of their reasons to go after them.
[3:38:12.480 --> 3:38:15.480]  Well, the whole situation there is basically,
[3:38:15.480 --> 3:38:18.480]  they trump up their lives like they do with everybody else,
[3:38:18.480 --> 3:38:20.480]  but I believe they're moving to a larger scale now.
[3:38:20.480 --> 3:38:22.480]  They're moving, they're coming in
[3:38:22.480 --> 3:38:24.480]  and they're taking Christian children out of Christian home,
[3:38:24.480 --> 3:38:26.480]  out of Christian schools,
[3:38:26.480 --> 3:38:28.480]  and they're doing it at a large scale now.
[3:38:28.480 --> 3:38:30.480]  They've tried it before.
[3:38:30.480 --> 3:38:32.480]  No, no, I get the reports, and the Tatletail neighbors
[3:38:32.480 --> 3:38:35.480]  see children playing in the backyard at lunchtime on recess.
[3:38:35.480 --> 3:38:37.480]  They think it's illegal to have your children at home,
[3:38:37.480 --> 3:38:39.480]  and then they call the police on you.
[3:38:39.480 --> 3:38:43.480]  I mean, it's just absolutely incredible
[3:38:43.480 --> 3:38:45.480]  to have this going on.
[3:38:45.480 --> 3:38:47.480]  Specifically though, recap for folks that don't know
[3:38:47.480 --> 3:38:50.480]  about how they've been going after these communities
[3:38:50.480 --> 3:38:52.480]  and trying to grab their children.
[3:38:52.480 --> 3:38:54.480]  Well, it's just like the situation
[3:38:54.480 --> 3:38:56.480]  with what they've done to me.
[3:38:56.480 --> 3:38:58.480]  I mean, here, I was running for sheriff
[3:38:58.480 --> 3:39:00.480]  for the Republican Party here,
[3:39:00.480 --> 3:39:03.480]  and the Republican Party ended up in jail,
[3:39:03.480 --> 3:39:06.480]  and we just had to hear in this past Thursday on the 5th,
[3:39:06.480 --> 3:39:09.480]  the jury, if it wasn't for the jury between the judge
[3:39:09.480 --> 3:39:11.480]  and the state attorney's office, they wanted me in jail,
[3:39:11.480 --> 3:39:13.480]  the people stood up, one of the ladies said,
[3:39:13.480 --> 3:39:16.480]  listen, this is totally, this is unbelievable.
[3:39:16.480 --> 3:39:18.480]  I mean, right in the middle of the hearing.
[3:39:18.480 --> 3:39:20.480]  That's right, you were an official candidate,
[3:39:20.480 --> 3:39:22.480]  it was in the news, you went there and they said,
[3:39:22.480 --> 3:39:24.480]  you're not allowed to be here as a candidate, arrest him,
[3:39:24.480 --> 3:39:26.480]  and they were trying to charge you with trespassing,
[3:39:26.480 --> 3:39:29.480]  they did, and they tried to put you in prison for it,
[3:39:29.480 --> 3:39:31.480]  but the jury found you not guilty.
[3:39:31.480 --> 3:39:35.480]  Exactly, that's why we parents want our right to a trial by jury.
[3:39:35.480 --> 3:39:37.480]  DCF and Department of Children's Family
[3:39:37.480 --> 3:39:40.480]  will not give parents a right to a trial by jury.
[3:39:40.480 --> 3:39:42.480]  They come up with all these lies and false allegations,
[3:39:42.480 --> 3:39:45.480]  and when other people hear it, it's just totally insane.
[3:39:45.480 --> 3:39:49.480]  Well, I mean, I've seen the cases with the Yalamo case,
[3:39:49.480 --> 3:39:52.480]  wasn't it that some parents spanked lightly,
[3:39:52.480 --> 3:39:54.480]  one of their children, and that's why they're grabbing
[3:39:54.480 --> 3:39:56.480]  hundreds of people's children?
[3:39:56.480 --> 3:39:58.480]  I mean, let's talk about some of the things
[3:39:58.480 --> 3:40:01.480]  that have happened in this case.
[3:40:01.480 --> 3:40:02.480]  Angela?
[3:40:02.480 --> 3:40:05.480]  Yes, well, one of the things is they did say
[3:40:05.480 --> 3:40:07.480]  that they had spanked their children.
[3:40:07.480 --> 3:40:11.480]  It was parents, you know, spanking their children.
[3:40:11.480 --> 3:40:13.480]  But there's no law against that.
[3:40:13.480 --> 3:40:15.480]  There's no law, but they still take children
[3:40:15.480 --> 3:40:17.480]  because it's not real courts.
[3:40:17.480 --> 3:40:19.480]  Right, but then they took children
[3:40:19.480 --> 3:40:22.480]  that had no accusations of being spanked whatsoever,
[3:40:22.480 --> 3:40:24.480]  but they took them, they said,
[3:40:24.480 --> 3:40:26.480]  because it was medical neglect,
[3:40:26.480 --> 3:40:28.480]  because they didn't have their shots,
[3:40:28.480 --> 3:40:30.480]  and educational neglect,
[3:40:30.480 --> 3:40:34.480]  because although the children had been going to private school
[3:40:34.480 --> 3:40:36.480]  with the Apeca curriculum,
[3:40:36.480 --> 3:40:38.480]  and the children, when they tested them,
[3:40:38.480 --> 3:40:41.480]  they gave them the, when the DHS came and took them,
[3:40:41.480 --> 3:40:43.480]  they gave the children the PACE test,
[3:40:43.480 --> 3:40:48.480]  and all the children ranked either good to superior.
[3:40:48.480 --> 3:40:50.480]  A lot of the children ranked superior,
[3:40:50.480 --> 3:40:51.480]  but yet they still said...
[3:40:51.480 --> 3:40:52.480]  But let's understand this.
[3:40:52.480 --> 3:40:56.480]  The CPS was set up 90 years ago in the U.S.,
[3:40:56.480 --> 3:40:58.480]  outside courts, they're not real courts,
[3:40:58.480 --> 3:41:00.480]  to carry out eugenics and forced sterilization.
[3:41:00.480 --> 3:41:01.480]  It's in my film Endgame.
[3:41:01.480 --> 3:41:02.480]  It's on record.
[3:41:02.480 --> 3:41:04.480]  The newsreels from the 20s and 30s
[3:41:04.480 --> 3:41:06.480]  are saying how great eugenics is.
[3:41:06.480 --> 3:41:08.480]  These aren't real courts.
[3:41:08.480 --> 3:41:09.480]  And I remember seeing some of the newscasts
[3:41:09.480 --> 3:41:10.480]  and other articles where they said
[3:41:10.480 --> 3:41:13.480]  they were taking the children for not having vaccines
[3:41:13.480 --> 3:41:14.480]  when there's no law.
[3:41:14.480 --> 3:41:16.480]  You've got to take these deadly things.
[3:41:16.480 --> 3:41:18.480]  Exactly.
[3:41:18.480 --> 3:41:19.480]  Please continue.
[3:41:19.480 --> 3:41:21.480]  This is what I was going to say.
[3:41:21.480 --> 3:41:24.480]  When an animal is dead and a bird of prey comes upon it,
[3:41:24.480 --> 3:41:27.480]  the way they tell whether that carcass is dead or not
[3:41:27.480 --> 3:41:29.480]  is they pick at its eye.
[3:41:29.480 --> 3:41:32.480]  Whatever it is, it'll pick at the eye.
[3:41:32.480 --> 3:41:35.480]  And the Bible says the eye of a people is their children.
[3:41:35.480 --> 3:41:37.480]  And if America will allow them to come in
[3:41:37.480 --> 3:41:41.480]  and steal our children and start picking our children to pieces,
[3:41:41.480 --> 3:41:44.480]  that means this nation is internally dead.
[3:41:44.480 --> 3:41:45.480]  That's right.
[3:41:45.480 --> 3:41:47.480]  They're mad that they couldn't abort all the children,
[3:41:47.480 --> 3:41:48.480]  so they're going to wreck them.
[3:41:48.480 --> 3:41:49.480]  And it's in their own again,
[3:41:49.480 --> 3:41:50.480]  their own Department of Education.
[3:41:50.480 --> 3:41:52.480]  They want to wreck the family.
[3:41:52.480 --> 3:41:56.480]  Over 67% of the children in CPS clutches
[3:41:56.480 --> 3:41:59.480]  are on psychotropic drugs, folks.
[3:41:59.480 --> 3:42:03.480]  And then they testify in the state legislature in Texas
[3:42:03.480 --> 3:42:05.480]  that the children have bad gene pools
[3:42:05.480 --> 3:42:07.480]  and have to be all be put on drugs.
[3:42:07.480 --> 3:42:09.480]  Go ahead.
[3:42:09.480 --> 3:42:12.480]  Well, so, Alex, I want to thank you for being there
[3:42:12.480 --> 3:42:14.480]  because every time I've called,
[3:42:14.480 --> 3:42:16.480]  you have opened your program up
[3:42:16.480 --> 3:42:18.480]  in order for us to cry out as parents.
[3:42:18.480 --> 3:42:20.480]  I mean, I haven't seen my kids now for over a year.
[3:42:20.480 --> 3:42:22.480]  This has gone on for four years.
[3:42:22.480 --> 3:42:24.480]  For three years, we could only see them one hour a month.
[3:42:24.480 --> 3:42:28.480]  And if people were to go to the LMOministries.com
[3:42:28.480 --> 3:42:32.480]  and look at, they put on their website the stipulations
[3:42:32.480 --> 3:42:33.480]  when they go to visit their kids,
[3:42:33.480 --> 3:42:34.480]  what they can and can't say.
[3:42:34.480 --> 3:42:36.480]  They can't whisper to their children.
[3:42:36.480 --> 3:42:37.480]  They can't.
[3:42:37.480 --> 3:42:38.480]  And this is what they're doing.
[3:42:38.480 --> 3:42:40.480]  They're isolating the parents from the children.
[3:42:40.480 --> 3:42:42.480]  And if they destroy our families, we have no nation.
[3:42:42.480 --> 3:42:44.480]  And there's no due process.
[3:42:44.480 --> 3:42:45.480]  There's no nothing.
[3:42:45.480 --> 3:42:48.480]  And they're clearly targeting Christians everywhere,
[3:42:48.480 --> 3:42:50.480]  particularly this is persecution.
[3:42:50.480 --> 3:42:53.480]  Continue with what's happened with the children
[3:42:53.480 --> 3:42:55.480]  that go to this church.
[3:42:55.480 --> 3:42:57.480]  Well, I can put on Alice Andrusack.
[3:42:57.480 --> 3:43:01.480]  She was actually here when they came and they raided.
[3:43:01.480 --> 3:43:04.480]  And they took her sister and five other children
[3:43:04.480 --> 3:43:05.480]  in the first time.
[3:43:05.480 --> 3:43:08.480]  And matter of fact, the judge bumped her
[3:43:08.480 --> 3:43:10.480]  from being able to visit her sister
[3:43:10.480 --> 3:43:11.480]  and her brother who were taken.
[3:43:11.480 --> 3:43:14.480]  And he said the only way she can visit again
[3:43:14.480 --> 3:43:16.480]  is if she puts in a motion
[3:43:16.480 --> 3:43:18.480]  to where she's put under a gag order
[3:43:18.480 --> 3:43:20.480]  because they're obviously so worried about
[3:43:20.480 --> 3:43:23.480]  what she has to say about how they're torturing
[3:43:23.480 --> 3:43:26.480]  and how her brother and sister don't want to be there
[3:43:26.480 --> 3:43:27.480]  and they want to come home.
[3:43:27.480 --> 3:43:28.480]  But I'm going to put her on
[3:43:28.480 --> 3:43:30.480]  because she can of course tell it better than I can.
[3:43:30.480 --> 3:43:31.480]  All right.
[3:43:31.480 --> 3:43:32.480]  Hello?
[3:43:32.480 --> 3:43:33.480]  Yes, ma'am.
[3:43:33.480 --> 3:43:34.480]  Go ahead.
[3:43:34.480 --> 3:43:35.480]  Okay.
[3:43:35.480 --> 3:43:40.480]  The day of the raid was September 20th in 2008.
[3:43:40.480 --> 3:43:43.480]  And the kids were outside playing.
[3:43:43.480 --> 3:43:44.480]  It was a beautiful day.
[3:43:44.480 --> 3:43:46.480]  We have miniature ponies
[3:43:46.480 --> 3:43:48.480]  and they were outside writing the ponies
[3:43:48.480 --> 3:43:51.480]  and playing with the little cocker spaniel dog.
[3:43:51.480 --> 3:43:53.480]  And some of the girls were doing some,
[3:43:53.480 --> 3:43:55.480]  putting together some literature,
[3:43:55.480 --> 3:43:56.480]  gospel literature,
[3:43:56.480 --> 3:43:59.480]  and another section of the school admission.
[3:43:59.480 --> 3:44:04.480]  And I was upstairs in the office answering the phones.
[3:44:04.480 --> 3:44:06.480]  And all of a sudden, all these people,
[3:44:06.480 --> 3:44:10.480]  like hundreds of FBI, BATF,
[3:44:10.480 --> 3:44:14.480]  the state police came swarming up our street
[3:44:14.480 --> 3:44:17.480]  and they jumped over the fence.
[3:44:17.480 --> 3:44:19.480]  First, they were banging on the fence outside
[3:44:19.480 --> 3:44:23.480]  and they freaked the people out outside.
[3:44:23.480 --> 3:44:26.480]  They were saying, open the gate, open the gate.
[3:44:26.480 --> 3:44:27.480]  Let us come in.
[3:44:27.480 --> 3:44:28.480]  And one of the girls that was out there
[3:44:28.480 --> 3:44:30.480]  ran back to the adults and said,
[3:44:30.480 --> 3:44:31.480]  somebody's trying to break in.
[3:44:31.480 --> 3:44:32.480]  We don't know what's going on.
[3:44:32.480 --> 3:44:34.480]  Help us, you know?
[3:44:34.480 --> 3:44:37.480]  And so then when they jumped over the fence
[3:44:37.480 --> 3:44:39.480]  and got into the backyard,
[3:44:39.480 --> 3:44:41.480]  instead of coming in the front door,
[3:44:41.480 --> 3:44:43.480]  which was totally unlocked,
[3:44:43.480 --> 3:44:45.480]  they came over to a sliding glass window.
[3:44:45.480 --> 3:44:48.480]  There's a sunroom and it has sliding glass doors.
[3:44:48.480 --> 3:44:50.480]  And that's where I was.
[3:44:50.480 --> 3:44:53.480]  And then I saw them and they were dressed in black
[3:44:53.480 --> 3:44:54.480]  from head to toe.
[3:44:54.480 --> 3:44:55.480]  And I didn't know who they were
[3:44:55.480 --> 3:44:57.480]  and they had this huge machine.
[3:44:57.480 --> 3:44:59.480]  And the first thing I thought was,
[3:44:59.480 --> 3:45:01.480]  maybe it was a Terminex company or something
[3:45:01.480 --> 3:45:04.480]  coming to, you know, come and terminate the termites
[3:45:04.480 --> 3:45:06.480]  or something, because it's a huge machine they had.
[3:45:06.480 --> 3:45:08.480]  And then I looked over and I saw FBI on their arm
[3:45:08.480 --> 3:45:11.480]  and I realized it was a huge machine gun they had.
[3:45:11.480 --> 3:45:13.480]  And then I could hear them saying,
[3:45:13.480 --> 3:45:15.480]  they couldn't see me because the windows were tinted.
[3:45:15.480 --> 3:45:17.480]  But I could hear them saying,
[3:45:17.480 --> 3:45:19.480]  this is the easiest way they said to get in.
[3:45:19.480 --> 3:45:21.480]  Come on, we've got to take down this door.
[3:45:21.480 --> 3:45:23.480]  And so at that point I freaked out,
[3:45:23.480 --> 3:45:25.480]  because the only thing I know about these people
[3:45:25.480 --> 3:45:27.480]  is I know what they did to the people in Waco.
[3:45:27.480 --> 3:45:29.480]  They killed them mercilessly.
[3:45:29.480 --> 3:45:30.480]  They had no trial.
[3:45:30.480 --> 3:45:31.480]  They had no rights.
[3:45:31.480 --> 3:45:33.480]  They couldn't call the media.
[3:45:33.480 --> 3:45:34.480]  They couldn't call anybody.
[3:45:34.480 --> 3:45:37.480]  So I was terrified and I jumped up
[3:45:37.480 --> 3:45:39.480]  and I ran down to where the other girls
[3:45:39.480 --> 3:45:41.480]  were in the other part of the school and mission,
[3:45:41.480 --> 3:45:43.480]  where they were putting the gospel literature together.
[3:45:43.480 --> 3:45:46.480]  And I told them, we have to get out of here now, hurry.
[3:45:46.480 --> 3:45:48.480]  You know, there's somebody breaking in.
[3:45:48.480 --> 3:45:49.480]  The FBI is here.
[3:45:49.480 --> 3:45:50.480]  They have machine guns.
[3:45:50.480 --> 3:45:51.480]  We've got to get out now.
[3:45:51.480 --> 3:45:53.480]  They could surround things and burn it down again.
[3:45:53.480 --> 3:45:54.480]  And they love that.
[3:45:54.480 --> 3:45:55.480]  Exactly.
[3:45:55.480 --> 3:45:57.480]  There was helicopters flying overhead,
[3:45:57.480 --> 3:45:59.480]  two or three at least.
[3:45:59.480 --> 3:46:01.480]  They came so low.
[3:46:01.480 --> 3:46:02.480]  What?
[3:46:02.480 --> 3:46:04.480]  They had snipers.
[3:46:04.480 --> 3:46:07.480]  They had their medics there with all their riot gear.
[3:46:07.480 --> 3:46:10.480]  They had the bulletproof vest.
[3:46:10.480 --> 3:46:13.480]  They had, you know, they were just dressed to the hilt
[3:46:13.480 --> 3:46:17.480]  for this combat against three women and six children.
[3:46:17.480 --> 3:46:19.480]  That's who they had.
[3:46:19.480 --> 3:46:20.480]  Okay.
[3:46:20.480 --> 3:46:21.480]  And then now they've said,
[3:46:21.480 --> 3:46:23.480]  not vaccinating is the big crime,
[3:46:23.480 --> 3:46:25.480]  but you can't get a jury.
[3:46:25.480 --> 3:46:29.480]  You can't get a real court because it's a eugenics court.
[3:46:29.480 --> 3:46:30.480]  Exactly.
[3:46:30.480 --> 3:46:34.480]  And so then we went, we tried to get out a back gate
[3:46:34.480 --> 3:46:37.480]  on the property and when we opened the gate,
[3:46:37.480 --> 3:46:39.480]  somebody was already there.
[3:46:39.480 --> 3:46:41.480]  Of course, they already had us surrounded and they told us
[3:46:41.480 --> 3:46:45.480]  to go back in that it was just a police safety check.
[3:46:45.480 --> 3:46:48.480]  And they told us we had to go back inside the house
[3:46:48.480 --> 3:46:49.480]  or the school admission.
[3:46:49.480 --> 3:46:51.480]  And so we went back inside and I tried to have,
[3:46:51.480 --> 3:46:53.480]  I had a cell phone, but it was dead.
[3:46:53.480 --> 3:46:55.480]  And I was trying to call somebody to tell them,
[3:46:55.480 --> 3:46:56.480]  please help us.
[3:46:56.480 --> 3:46:57.480]  You know, we're stuck over here.
[3:46:57.480 --> 3:46:58.480]  We don't know what's going on.
[3:46:58.480 --> 3:46:59.480]  We're surrounded.
[3:46:59.480 --> 3:47:00.480]  They have these guns.
[3:47:00.480 --> 3:47:01.480]  And, you know, for all we knew,
[3:47:01.480 --> 3:47:03.480]  we were going to be killed any minute.
[3:47:03.480 --> 3:47:06.480]  And so then as we were going back up to the main part
[3:47:06.480 --> 3:47:09.480]  of the school admission or the office,
[3:47:09.480 --> 3:47:12.480]  three people, three FBI agents came down there
[3:47:12.480 --> 3:47:15.480]  and they had their laser lights pointed at our hearts.
[3:47:15.480 --> 3:47:17.480]  It was me and three other girls.
[3:47:17.480 --> 3:47:19.480]  Well, they feed off that terror.
[3:47:19.480 --> 3:47:21.480]  They were ranging from like 16 to 17.
[3:47:21.480 --> 3:47:23.480]  Yeah, they feed off the power.
[3:47:23.480 --> 3:47:24.480]  Anyway, let's go ahead.
[3:47:24.480 --> 3:47:25.480]  Yeah, exactly.
[3:47:25.480 --> 3:47:26.480]  And we had no idea.
[3:47:26.480 --> 3:47:27.480]  I thought they were going to shoot us.
[3:47:27.480 --> 3:47:29.480]  So they were pointing them at guns.
[3:47:29.480 --> 3:47:30.480]  They were pointing the guns at them.
[3:47:30.480 --> 3:47:32.480]  No, so they didn't see exactly where to shoot.
[3:47:32.480 --> 3:47:33.480]  They had pointed them.
[3:47:33.480 --> 3:47:37.480]  They were pointing it at children.
[3:47:37.480 --> 3:47:40.480]  Then they told us, you know, put your hands in the air.
[3:47:40.480 --> 3:47:41.480]  Stop where you are.
[3:47:41.480 --> 3:47:43.480]  Don't, you know, everyone stands still.
[3:47:43.480 --> 3:47:45.480]  And so we froze there.
[3:47:45.480 --> 3:47:47.480]  And we're like, can we turn on the light?
[3:47:47.480 --> 3:47:48.480]  Because we had some of the windows open.
[3:47:48.480 --> 3:47:50.480]  So there was sunlight, but the actual light wasn't on.
[3:47:50.480 --> 3:47:52.480]  And they're like, no, stay where you are.
[3:47:52.480 --> 3:47:54.480]  And then they come down there with their guns still pointed
[3:47:54.480 --> 3:47:56.480]  at us and they told us to come over.
[3:47:56.480 --> 3:47:58.480]  And I said, why do you have to point those guns at us?
[3:47:58.480 --> 3:47:59.480]  You know, we're just girls.
[3:47:59.480 --> 3:48:00.480]  What are you doing?
[3:48:00.480 --> 3:48:01.480]  Why are you doing this?
[3:48:01.480 --> 3:48:03.480]  We don't have any weapons.
[3:48:03.480 --> 3:48:04.480]  And they said, you don't have any weapons.
[3:48:04.480 --> 3:48:06.480]  And we said, no, we don't have any weapons.
[3:48:06.480 --> 3:48:09.480]  I've never even seen a gun before except for the one you're pointing at me.
[3:48:09.480 --> 3:48:12.480]  And so he's like, oh, well, you know, I'm sorry, miss,
[3:48:12.480 --> 3:48:14.480]  but we just have to do this, you know,
[3:48:14.480 --> 3:48:18.480]  because we've got to check for papers and evidence of stuff we've had.
[3:48:18.480 --> 3:48:20.480]  Did they point the guns, ma'am?
[3:48:20.480 --> 3:48:22.480]  Ma'am, ma'am, ma'am, put her on hold.
[3:48:22.480 --> 3:48:23.480]  Put her on hold.
[3:48:23.480 --> 3:48:25.480]  We're going to have to put her on hold.
[3:48:25.480 --> 3:48:27.480]  You know, again, Greg Pound calls up every week
[3:48:27.480 --> 3:48:29.480]  and he's got new stories, new information to cover.
[3:48:29.480 --> 3:48:31.480]  I didn't know that this was a subject.
[3:48:31.480 --> 3:48:34.480]  There's no way to do it in just 20 minutes.
[3:48:34.480 --> 3:48:36.480]  So I'm going to have to have these ladies and Greg Pound
[3:48:36.480 --> 3:48:41.480]  later in the week or next week to do a full hour, perhaps longer with them on this
[3:48:41.480 --> 3:48:43.480]  because I would have pulled up all my news articles about this
[3:48:43.480 --> 3:48:46.480]  because I'm aware of this case and we've been able to cover it.
[3:48:46.480 --> 3:48:50.480]  He specifically was going to come on dealing, he said, with vaccinations.
[3:48:50.480 --> 3:48:54.480]  And that's the big issue here is that all of this tyranny is wrong.
[3:48:54.480 --> 3:48:56.480]  All of this tyranny is bad.
[3:48:56.480 --> 3:49:01.480]  But specifically, I remember in this case, there's so many, when he brought it up,
[3:49:01.480 --> 3:49:04.480]  I do remember that they're bringing up no vaccinations.
[3:49:04.480 --> 3:49:05.480]  Well, that's not a law.
[3:49:05.480 --> 3:49:08.480]  But remember six months ago when the California court said,
[3:49:08.480 --> 3:49:11.480]  parents aren't the parents, the state owns the children,
[3:49:11.480 --> 3:49:15.480]  and that we say you will not be homeschooled, banning homeschooling.
[3:49:15.480 --> 3:49:16.480]  Now that got overturned.
[3:49:16.480 --> 3:49:20.480]  But that shows the attitude and the mindset and they pick out these religious groups.
[3:49:20.480 --> 3:49:25.480]  They think they can demonize with the public to set the precedent to be able to do all of this.
[3:49:25.480 --> 3:49:28.480]  So what I'm going to do is at a later date and show,
[3:49:28.480 --> 3:49:32.480]  I'm going to get Angela and others back on when I, you know,
[3:49:32.480 --> 3:49:36.480]  can fully talk to them beforehand about their story and cover it properly.
[3:49:36.480 --> 3:49:40.480]  Greg, you know, a lot of times when you call us, it's such short notice,
[3:49:40.480 --> 3:49:43.480]  we need to really, you know, make sure that next time you come on,
[3:49:43.480 --> 3:49:47.480]  I specifically know everything we're going to be covering.
[3:49:47.480 --> 3:49:52.480]  But give us the Alamo Ministries a site again and recap anything else you want to cover.
[3:49:52.480 --> 3:49:55.480]  Well, it's lmoministries.com.
[3:49:55.480 --> 3:49:57.480]  And if you just go there and study this ministry,
[3:49:57.480 --> 3:50:00.480]  it's hard to believe that they can take 37 children out there
[3:50:00.480 --> 3:50:02.480]  and then have a pickup order for 120 more.
[3:50:02.480 --> 3:50:05.480]  But they're doing the same thing in the state of Florida.
[3:50:05.480 --> 3:50:10.480]  And that website, freearkids.com, it's been eliminated.
[3:50:10.480 --> 3:50:14.480]  So now I've got one other website, rescuemykids.com, Alex.
[3:50:14.480 --> 3:50:18.480]  It's rescuemykids.com where people can watch and see what's going on
[3:50:18.480 --> 3:50:22.480]  in Pinellas County where they starved Terry Shival to death.
[3:50:22.480 --> 3:50:26.480]  So what happens is we've got now a system where they're coming in and stealing our kids.
[3:50:26.480 --> 3:50:28.480]  And if we don't somehow, we're going to have to,
[3:50:28.480 --> 3:50:31.480]  we're going to have to hold these people accountable for what they're doing.
[3:50:31.480 --> 3:50:33.480]  I mean, this is totally out of control.
[3:50:33.480 --> 3:50:34.480]  All right, stay there.
[3:50:34.480 --> 3:50:37.480]  I'm going to come back and plug your new websites again.
[3:50:37.480 --> 3:50:40.480]  I didn't realize that freearkids have been, yeah, now I'm on the site.
[3:50:40.480 --> 3:50:42.480]  It says it's going to be auction to go to daddy.
[3:50:42.480 --> 3:50:43.480]  So I guess you lost that site.
[3:50:43.480 --> 3:50:46.480]  That's too bad to hear that because your sites were massive
[3:50:46.480 --> 3:50:48.480]  and had so much evidence of abuse of children.
[3:50:48.480 --> 3:50:51.480]  By the way, even according to Time and Newsweek,
[3:50:51.480 --> 3:50:56.480]  you're five times more likely as a child to be abused in government custody than any other place.
[3:50:56.480 --> 3:50:59.480]  Take the Texas Youth Commission, literal rape rooms.
[3:50:59.480 --> 3:51:01.480]  They want your children.
[3:51:01.480 --> 3:51:05.480]  Do you suffer from aches and pains in your knees, arms, wrists, or elbows?
[3:51:05.480 --> 3:51:09.480]  Is it difficult to get out of bed in the morning because of joint stiffness?

[3:54:09.480 --> 3:54:13.480]  The state always tries to take over the future.
[3:54:13.480 --> 3:54:17.480]  Angela and others, what I'm going to do is
[3:54:17.480 --> 3:54:20.480]  Greg, bringing you up, what I need to do is
[3:54:20.480 --> 3:54:25.480]  get like an hour and a half with you and Pastor Tony Alamo
[3:54:25.480 --> 3:54:29.480]  of Alamo Ministries on, I've been meaning to cover this.
[3:54:29.480 --> 3:54:32.480]  There's just so many cases of them grabbing children or harassing churches
[3:54:32.480 --> 3:54:35.480]  and it's been proven that they've made almost everything up
[3:54:35.480 --> 3:54:37.480]  and now they're saying they're taking the children over vaccines.
[3:54:37.480 --> 3:54:41.480]  I want to do justice to this instead of it just being all over the map.
[3:54:41.480 --> 3:54:47.480]  So, you know, I mean I would guess you've talked to Pastor Alamo.
[3:54:47.480 --> 3:54:50.480]  Alex, the church is like a sleeping giant
[3:54:50.480 --> 3:54:52.480]  and if the church doesn't wake up in America,
[3:54:52.480 --> 3:54:56.480]  I mean if you could tap into the church and get the church woken up,
[3:54:56.480 --> 3:54:58.480]  I mean this battle will be over.
[3:54:58.480 --> 3:55:00.480]  No, I understand that. We don't have a lot of time left.
[3:55:00.480 --> 3:55:03.480]  I'm saying can we set up a longer interview with you guys?
[3:55:03.480 --> 3:55:05.480]  Yeah, that'll work. That's sure.
[3:55:05.480 --> 3:55:07.480]  I want to make sure we coordinate that because Greg,
[3:55:07.480 --> 3:55:09.480]  I know you're really busy sometimes I'll set you up for the show
[3:55:09.480 --> 3:55:12.480]  and you're not there when we call because you're so immersed in all of this
[3:55:12.480 --> 3:55:14.480]  with them stanching children all around you in Florida.
[3:55:14.480 --> 3:55:16.480]  And then this isn't even people in churches.
[3:55:16.480 --> 3:55:19.480]  This is just regular homeschooling middle class families
[3:55:19.480 --> 3:55:21.480]  that they're targeting and ladies,
[3:55:21.480 --> 3:55:23.480]  I want to have you both back up,
[3:55:23.480 --> 3:55:27.480]  but I need to specifically study the angle of the case that you're involved in
[3:55:27.480 --> 3:55:31.480]  and specifically what is the gag order on?
[3:55:31.480 --> 3:55:34.480]  From talking about the case to anybody
[3:55:34.480 --> 3:55:37.480]  and explaining to anybody how the kids don't want to be there
[3:55:37.480 --> 3:55:40.480]  and how the kids are so sick from the shots that they've been giving up,
[3:55:40.480 --> 3:55:43.480]  they don't want us talking about the case.
[3:55:43.480 --> 3:55:45.480]  Can you imagine that, Alex?
[3:55:45.480 --> 3:55:48.480]  You can't even talk about a case where they come in and steal 37 kids
[3:55:48.480 --> 3:55:52.480]  and they've got to pick up order for 120 more kids?
[3:55:52.480 --> 3:55:58.480]  Well, look, Pastor Alamo, or Alamo, they pronounce it both ways,
[3:55:58.480 --> 3:56:01.480]  he's not in their custody right now, is he?
[3:56:01.480 --> 3:56:02.480]  Yes, he is.
[3:56:02.480 --> 3:56:04.480]  Okay, we can't talk to him.
[3:56:04.480 --> 3:56:07.480]  He's been held without bond even though he has not been to trial
[3:56:07.480 --> 3:56:10.480]  and even though he's innocent, they're still holding him.
[3:56:10.480 --> 3:56:14.480]  Okay, I need to research the latest updates on the case then.
[3:56:14.480 --> 3:56:19.480]  Greg, who do you recommend, or ladies, who do you recommend I have on the show
[3:56:19.480 --> 3:56:23.480]  so we can just go through this in a chronological order?
[3:56:23.480 --> 3:56:26.480]  Whoever you say.
[3:56:26.480 --> 3:56:27.480]  We have lots of people.
[3:56:27.480 --> 3:56:30.480]  We have other people who another one, Tamela Reed,
[3:56:30.480 --> 3:56:35.480]  also was stopped from being able to visit her sisters and brother
[3:56:35.480 --> 3:56:40.480]  because unless they can put a specific gag order on her,
[3:56:40.480 --> 3:56:42.480]  they don't want her to be able to go.
[3:56:42.480 --> 3:56:44.480]  They don't want anybody to take any pictures.
[3:56:44.480 --> 3:56:47.480]  They don't want anybody who has contact with them who can tell people
[3:56:47.480 --> 3:56:49.480]  what's really going on.
[3:56:49.480 --> 3:56:53.480]  Well, we're going to wait into this and cover it because it's just, you know,
[3:56:53.480 --> 3:56:57.480]  you guys, I've looked at it, there's no evidence of anything wrong
[3:56:57.480 --> 3:56:59.480]  with that Mormon splinter group.
[3:56:59.480 --> 3:57:01.480]  It was a little weird, but later it came out.
[3:57:01.480 --> 3:57:04.480]  The media had exaggerated it all, violated.
[3:57:04.480 --> 3:57:05.480]  The legislature got involved.
[3:57:05.480 --> 3:57:08.480]  They had to release the hundreds of children and women.
[3:57:08.480 --> 3:57:13.480]  I mean, this group from looking at it is way more mainstream
[3:57:13.480 --> 3:57:14.480]  than even that group.
[3:57:14.480 --> 3:57:17.480]  And clearly if we can get national attention on this,
[3:57:17.480 --> 3:57:20.480]  they need to release these children and have due process.
[3:57:20.480 --> 3:57:22.480]  And that happened in Texas.
[3:57:22.480 --> 3:57:25.480]  It came out that it wasn't due process, that it wasn't real courts,
[3:57:25.480 --> 3:57:27.480]  that they violated everything.
[3:57:27.480 --> 3:57:32.480]  And so this needs to happen here because they're setting the precedent
[3:57:32.480 --> 3:57:34.480]  with you guys and it's very, very scary.
[3:57:34.480 --> 3:57:37.480]  So we'll put up your website on screen again.
[3:57:37.480 --> 3:57:40.480]  RescueMyKids.com, that is the new site, Greg.
[3:57:40.480 --> 3:57:41.480]  Right, that's it.
[3:57:41.480 --> 3:57:43.480]  Okay, well, let's do this.
[3:57:43.480 --> 3:57:48.480]  We've got to coordinate this and sometime later in the week or next week.
[3:57:48.480 --> 3:57:52.480]  Maybe we should have some of the other leaders of the church on.
[3:57:52.480 --> 3:57:55.480]  I think it's always, I mean, are there any other leaders of the church we can have on?
[3:57:55.480 --> 3:58:00.480]  Yeah, we'll go through them and we'll pick out the best ones and we'll get with Rob.
[3:58:00.480 --> 3:58:03.480]  Okay, well, we'll coordinate all this, Greg Pound and ladies, God bless you.
[3:58:03.480 --> 3:58:06.480]  It's just more of the carnage we document here.
[3:58:06.480 --> 3:58:08.480]  I covered a lot of key news in the first hour.
[3:58:08.480 --> 3:58:13.480]  I did a review of the Watchmen and then that Illuminati propaganda.
[3:58:13.480 --> 3:58:16.480]  We had a state rep on, covered a lot of other key news.
[3:58:16.480 --> 3:58:19.480]  Re-broadcast starts now, one place, infowars.com,
[3:58:19.480 --> 3:58:22.480]  and the audio streams and then re-arrows on stations around the country.
[3:58:22.480 --> 3:58:26.480]  If you're listening on AM or FM, please spread the word about that final affiliate and how folks can tune in.
[3:58:26.480 --> 3:58:32.480]  And don't forget, the Obama deception is on sale right now on DVD at infowars.com.
[3:58:32.480 --> 3:58:36.480]  You can watch it at prisonplanet.tv coming up this Saturday, 6pm.
[3:58:36.480 --> 3:58:38.480]  We'll be back in 70 seconds at infowars.com.
[3:58:38.480 --> 3:58:39.480]  God bless you all.
[3:58:39.480 --> 3:59:08.480]  Great job.
[3:59:09.480 --> 3:59:11.480]  Thank you so much for watching.
[3:59:39.480 --> 3:59:49.480]  Thank you.
