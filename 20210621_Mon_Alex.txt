[00:00.000 --> 00:28.840]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[00:28.840 --> 00:36.200]  Ladies and gentlemen, thank you so much for joining us on this live Monday Worldwide Transition.
[00:36.200 --> 00:40.480]  And I say that on purpose because I am here in New York City.
[00:40.480 --> 00:44.800]  And a lot of people are awake, a lot of people are aware of what's happening, but others
[00:44.800 --> 00:52.880]  are under this total scientific takeover that is transitioning us from a human family and
[00:52.880 --> 00:58.000]  from the way we've been biologically designed by God into this artificial system.
[00:58.000 --> 01:03.360]  You see more rainbow flags and you see American flags and that's a symbol of the globalist
[01:03.360 --> 01:05.680]  transhumanist UN takeover.
[01:05.680 --> 01:10.600]  I went down to the United Nations yesterday and even though I'm aware of the New World
[01:10.600 --> 01:16.440]  Order's takeover, you would think more than most people, I was blown away by the signs
[01:16.440 --> 01:25.440]  they had there saying soon you won't live in cities, you'll live in communes.
[01:25.440 --> 01:29.720]  And you won't have families anymore.
[01:29.720 --> 01:36.440]  And science will take control of all life on earth, including the weather.
[01:36.440 --> 01:43.280]  And so it is a total scientific dictatorship, declaration of war.
[01:43.280 --> 01:48.160]  And under this tyrannical science, you are not allowed to question anything they do.
[01:48.160 --> 01:53.160]  They are the science and you will bow down to the tyrant.
[01:53.160 --> 01:58.360]  So it's like I said in the film Endgame that I made 14 years ago, it's a world where the
[01:58.360 --> 02:02.600]  science of tyranny is law.
[02:02.600 --> 02:06.800]  There's different schools of science and thought, but the classical western science that goes
[02:06.800 --> 02:12.880]  back to the Greeks 2,300 years ago is now being replaced with this modern transhumanist
[02:12.880 --> 02:13.880]  system.
[02:13.880 --> 02:17.560]  I want to talk a lot about it here in the first hour today because everything else is window
[02:17.560 --> 02:18.560]  dressing.
[02:18.560 --> 02:24.040]  I also went to the Pfizer headquarters, they had similar revolutionary statements up.
[02:24.040 --> 02:28.480]  It all sounds like Klaus Schwab wrote it, but as Klaus Schwab did, he used to head
[02:28.480 --> 02:33.320]  up the United Nations Sustainability operation, when you hear the word sustainability, that
[02:33.320 --> 02:36.560]  means they're going to put you under siege, cut you off.
[02:36.560 --> 02:42.320]  And they even on the side of the U.N. building had these huge posters here in New York that
[02:42.320 --> 02:46.720]  said soon you won't live in cities, you'll live in communes.
[02:46.720 --> 02:50.040]  And my camera guy goes, what's a commune, and I go, it's like being in boot camp for
[02:50.040 --> 02:51.040]  the rest of your life.
[02:51.040 --> 02:56.320]  You're in a dormitory, women are in a different area, men and women are segregated, your children
[02:56.320 --> 03:00.120]  are taken away from you, you've been allowed to have children.
[03:00.120 --> 03:03.360]  It's truly a nightmare scenario, Facebook's pushing it, Twitter, all of them.
[03:03.360 --> 03:06.560]  This is a real revolution, but it's beyond communist.
[03:06.560 --> 03:12.080]  It's a transhumanist revolution, and I just saw articles on InfoWars.com, we're in the
[03:12.080 --> 03:15.640]  U.K., the U.S., Australia, it's all the same.
[03:15.640 --> 03:22.120]  They're setting up even the famous Oxford, the birth of real classical modern free speech,
[03:22.120 --> 03:27.760]  where the newspaper, one of the oldest student newspapers in the world, has a group of woke
[03:27.760 --> 03:33.080]  students, of course, who are self-appointed, that the university says will give all the
[03:33.080 --> 03:39.160]  orders and who will proofread and allow what is to be published or not, and will also put
[03:39.160 --> 03:43.520]  notes in the newspaper about what's bad, what's hurtful, and what's evil.
[03:43.520 --> 03:48.200]  So this is, again, the plan is everything's pre-approved.
[03:48.200 --> 03:54.280]  They wage war on language, they had Esperanza at the United Nations in the 60s and 70s,
[03:54.280 --> 03:57.600]  where they thought they would get rid of all the individual languages and make you have
[03:57.600 --> 04:02.120]  one language, but that didn't work, people liked their languages, and so Esperanza, the
[04:02.120 --> 04:09.440]  mix of English, Spanish, German, and Chinese, Japanese, it never took off, but now they
[04:09.440 --> 04:14.120]  can destroy the language by claiming all of it's evil and hurtful and bad and bringing
[04:14.120 --> 04:17.680]  in all these pronouns and cult programming, this is a very scientific plan.
[04:17.680 --> 04:21.120]  We've got a lot of other big news today as well, as you can see, I'm here in New York,
[04:21.120 --> 04:25.480]  if your TV viewers are overlooking Central Park, Owen Schreuer will be hosting the second
[04:25.480 --> 04:27.200]  and third hour, we'll be hosting a lot of this hour as well.
[04:27.200 --> 04:29.720]  Owen, tell folks some of the things you're focused on.
[04:29.720 --> 04:34.680]  Well, Alex, quite frankly, the news that I have to cover today, I'd like you to cover
[04:34.680 --> 04:37.480]  it with me because it's just so over the top.
[04:37.480 --> 04:42.840]  We now know that the Biden administration is actively covering up intelligence that
[04:42.840 --> 04:47.000]  COVID-19 was a Chinese bio weapon, they're actively doing that.
[04:47.000 --> 04:51.000]  And as you reported 10 years ago, they're now making police boards that are just all
[04:51.000 --> 04:55.080]  liberal leftists, they're now going to be deciding who gets to be a police and who doesn't.
[04:55.080 --> 04:58.480]  Stay there, let's come back and talk about both those in 60.
[04:58.480 --> 05:03.280]  The scientific dictatorship that I've been warning you about for 27 years has now gone
[05:03.280 --> 05:06.000]  for beta testing to operational.
[05:06.000 --> 05:10.800]  The globalists are out on the open with their planetary depopulation takeover, their robot
[05:10.800 --> 05:11.800]  takeover.
[05:11.800 --> 05:14.920]  But the good news is we've been working and you've been working and others have been
[05:14.920 --> 05:19.840]  working across the planet for decades to get ready for this, to be able to find it on.
[05:19.840 --> 05:23.960]  Humanity is strong, we're incredible and if we're aware of the attack that's happening,
[05:23.960 --> 05:25.640]  we have a real chance of defeating it.
[05:25.640 --> 05:28.120]  If we ask God for guidance, we will defeat it.
[05:28.120 --> 05:32.320]  So prayer is essential, research is essential, getting prepared is essential and warning
[05:32.320 --> 05:34.080]  others is absolutely essential.
[05:34.080 --> 05:38.560]  And at the same time, supporting InfoWars by buying high-quality products to keep us
[05:38.560 --> 05:42.240]  on air is essential because they're great products for you and your family and they're
[05:42.240 --> 05:44.240]  also funding our operation.
[05:44.240 --> 05:50.200]  InfoWarsStore.com, InfoWarsStore.com is incredible, a lot of our products that have been sold
[05:50.200 --> 05:54.400]  out because supply chain breakdowns are back in like bodies, vasobites and others.
[05:54.400 --> 06:12.520]  So get them today at InfoWarsStore.com and I thank you for being part of the resistance.
[06:12.520 --> 06:17.040]  Ladies and gentlemen, thank you so much for joining us on this live Monday edition.
[06:17.040 --> 06:22.920]  I'm Alex Jones, your host and we're going to be here for the next four hours on this
[06:22.920 --> 06:26.200]  June 21st, 2021 transmission.
[06:26.200 --> 06:32.520]  I want to be very, very clear here that everything we've ever talked about on air has basically
[06:32.520 --> 06:36.680]  already now come true and that's not because we were even that smart but we understood
[06:36.680 --> 06:40.800]  the globalists actually were in partial control of the planet.
[06:40.800 --> 06:44.840]  Now they're attempting to get full control, not just of all the corporations and military
[06:44.840 --> 06:50.480]  but of our bodies themselves, the final frontier is to be able to play God as mad scientist
[06:50.480 --> 06:56.880]  and what I've seen in New York City is a very paradoxical, a lot of people are awake and
[06:56.880 --> 07:01.600]  are upset about what's happening but a lot of other people are like zombies and are just
[07:01.600 --> 07:08.320]  caught in the throes of this anti-human takeover, this eugenics depopulation takeover wrapped
[07:08.320 --> 07:19.040]  in a rainbow flag and so that's what this evil is, is coming at us in a non-threatening
[07:19.040 --> 07:25.280]  charcoal unicorn outfit but it's actually deadly, deadly dangerous and they are moving
[07:25.280 --> 07:31.080]  ahead at laser light speed just to overwhelm us, they know the program they've launched
[07:31.080 --> 07:35.320]  is unpopular, they know what they're doing is being opposed across the world, they know
[07:35.320 --> 07:39.840]  their operations behind schedule but they are moving really quick.
[07:39.840 --> 07:51.160]  Now the central control system to all of this is the fact that the big pharma and the mad
[07:51.160 --> 08:02.000]  scientist that run the world are really the people that are in full control of this system
[08:02.000 --> 08:07.920]  and everything else flows out of that and so Fauci talked about how Trump would be challenged
[08:07.920 --> 08:12.640]  by a deadly virus, the UN drilled and prepared a user virus for world government, they did
[08:12.640 --> 08:16.760]  all the preconditioning in the news with the movies and the shows, they bought up all the
[08:16.760 --> 08:23.240]  major national health departments to be prepared, they pulled the wild viruses out of the wild,
[08:23.240 --> 08:28.480]  they integrated them together into a new virus to create fear and then they preconditioned
[08:28.480 --> 08:32.440]  the public and then rolled it out so we know that it didn't just come from the lab as we
[08:32.440 --> 08:39.760]  told you 16, 17 months ago, we now know that it was always planned and done by design so
[08:39.760 --> 08:44.240]  I really like Rand Paul, he's a great guy but he's still on Fox News with the big news,
[08:44.240 --> 08:49.640]  well it looks like it probably came out of the lab so we can't even get from its man
[08:49.640 --> 08:55.800]  made when all the science shows it is to the fact that it was released on purpose to create
[08:55.800 --> 09:00.760]  the fear and they wanted to be artificial so that when scientists looked at it they would
[09:00.760 --> 09:05.480]  get really, really scared of it when it's not a very dangerous strain of real super
[09:05.480 --> 09:10.800]  strains they've made and I want to be clear, new COVID versions, not the new ones they're
[09:10.800 --> 09:14.520]  scaring us with on the news, oh we got to keep you locked down because it's very under
[09:14.520 --> 09:18.200]  that variant, they're getting you ready in the future when they release super deadly
[09:18.200 --> 09:25.400]  variants that are in the same family of cooked up virus that you will then basically accept
[09:25.400 --> 09:31.720]  permanent martial law staying locked in your house while the economy collapses around you,
[09:31.720 --> 09:37.200]  that everyone's going to be formed into community work brigades in communes, there's posters
[09:37.200 --> 09:43.440]  all over the UN, all over Pfizer, all over the streets, New York is a fortress of globalist
[09:43.440 --> 09:48.160]  evil, even though a lot of the people are awake and they're just everywhere announcing
[09:48.160 --> 09:52.160]  it, it's like living in a body snatcher movie or something, people are like in these days
[09:52.160 --> 09:58.680]  just walking and just chirping that they love the New World Order basically and you can
[09:58.680 --> 10:03.600]  palpably see it and feel it and it's all the end of humanity, these leptis all look like
[10:03.600 --> 10:08.320]  some type of satanic spider, suck their soul out and you can see the people that are awake,
[10:08.320 --> 10:12.040]  every race, color and creed, they have light in their eyes, they love God, they're awake
[10:12.040 --> 10:16.400]  and those that have been taken over, it's like they're sleepwalking, old and young,
[10:16.400 --> 10:23.120]  and so this really is spirit of evil is upon people, in these cities where they've got
[10:23.120 --> 10:27.280]  full control and are able to, I believe the 5G and the studies show it are able to manipulate
[10:27.280 --> 10:33.640]  their minds even further and keep people in a trans-like state, this is really a scientific
[10:33.640 --> 10:39.520]  takeover and it's the globalist playing God, but the huge news that Owen Schreuer's got
[10:39.520 --> 10:44.360]  that now we know, Biden said two weeks ago in 30 days, so now that's another 15 days
[10:44.360 --> 10:50.480]  away, that he will tell us whether it came out of the lab or not, but the same group
[10:50.480 --> 10:54.080]  is running that cover up, that ran the cover up a year and a half ago and you've got Peter
[10:54.080 --> 10:58.160]  Dazik, of course now we learn working with Google to cover all this up and working to
[10:58.160 --> 11:03.920]  weaponize viruses with Fauci directly, so it's all one big sick evil club, Facebook's
[11:03.920 --> 11:08.560]  heavily invested, they all are, because they're going to be invested in genetic takeover,
[11:08.560 --> 11:13.120]  you've also got to control all the different facets of news and information, you've got
[11:13.120 --> 11:17.680]  to be able to censor, so that's why they were confident enough to launch this attack,
[11:17.680 --> 11:21.560]  they thought that they would keep it secret that it came out of the lab, but so many whistleblowers
[11:21.560 --> 11:26.040]  came forward, like I told you months ago, now they admit it's whistleblowers that didn't
[11:26.040 --> 11:30.280]  want to be implicated to go to prison and now a lot of their own people realize this
[11:30.280 --> 11:35.840]  is about depopulation, Dazik is a big depopulationist, all the top managers are, but the mid-level
[11:35.840 --> 11:41.560]  people are like, whoa, this is really real, this isn't just to save the earth or create
[11:41.560 --> 11:47.280]  deadly weapons, so in case somebody else makes them, we've got a parallel project, or even
[11:47.280 --> 11:50.760]  those that sign on to depopulation, now that they see it's going to be them and their family
[11:50.760 --> 11:54.480]  as well, and that everybody's going to be affected by this, they're having second thoughts,
[11:54.480 --> 11:58.600]  so that's why we've got to stay on air, as everything we talked about unfolds, as our
[11:58.600 --> 12:01.960]  credibility goes up, we're not supposed to be on air right now, we're supposed to already
[12:01.960 --> 12:05.400]  be forgotten about and memorable, but thanks to you, we're still here, because as they
[12:05.400 --> 12:10.720]  ramp this thing up, we need to be there talking directly to people in the system, at the FBI,
[12:10.720 --> 12:14.840]  at the NSA, at these private corporations, at Big Tech, and saying, is this really what
[12:14.840 --> 12:15.840]  you want from your family?
[12:15.840 --> 12:21.720]  Because this is a dystopia we're being taken to, not a utopia, I want to say this again,
[12:21.720 --> 12:24.480]  we have footage that I won't be able to air for a couple of days, because there's so much
[12:24.480 --> 12:28.560]  evidence, so incredible, I'm going to really do it some justice, but let's just say I've
[12:28.560 --> 12:34.480]  shot hours and hours of footage, probably shot three hours of footage, all of it's powerful,
[12:34.480 --> 12:38.600]  you saw four minutes of it last night, when I went to Jeffrey Epstein's compound, that's
[12:38.600 --> 12:43.640]  a powerful little four minutes, that's unedited, one take, me out there talking about it right
[12:43.640 --> 12:48.600]  in front of his place, I've shot hours of that, at the CFR, at the UN, at Pfizer, at
[12:48.600 --> 12:53.680]  other facilities, I'm going out today to shoot more, and I'm doing some big interviews, so
[12:53.680 --> 12:58.280]  just incredible time to see all this unfolding, but we've got to stay here, you've got to
[12:58.280 --> 13:03.440]  keep us here, because I realize how critical we are together, this whole emporers family,
[13:03.440 --> 13:07.320]  because people are listening on the inside, a lot of them, and we're helping decompartmentalize
[13:07.320 --> 13:14.440]  them, that's my power, that's our power, people are always asking me, who are your sources,
[13:14.440 --> 13:17.480]  how do you know all this stuff, and it's not about bragging, it's about understanding that
[13:17.480 --> 13:22.000]  I've read so much source material, studied these people so long, and also have a lot
[13:22.000 --> 13:26.920]  of great guests on that can also reverse engineer all this, like Dr. Francis Boyle and others,
[13:26.920 --> 13:32.200]  that I know what they're doing, I'm my own source, I can put all the pieces together,
[13:32.200 --> 13:38.160]  and so I advise a lot of former intelligence agency heads, not just a few of them, I advise
[13:38.160 --> 13:45.640]  heads of state, government, overtly and privately, and I mean, Bolsonaro's sun reached out,
[13:45.640 --> 13:48.600]  he says come down here, you help wake my dad up, wake me up, we want to have you here,
[13:48.600 --> 13:51.600]  I'll have that chance to go down there, and it's not about bragging, it's about you
[13:51.600 --> 13:55.880]  knowing why emporers are so special, because I'm able to really change world views and
[13:55.880 --> 13:59.320]  very important people, because they know, how does he know all this, how does he know
[13:59.320 --> 14:04.000]  all this, and this is a secret, I go no it's not, here's where the global is pre-programmed
[14:04.000 --> 14:07.880]  and got it ready, and then made it secret when it goes operational, but the preparation
[14:07.880 --> 14:12.600]  building is almost always public, and all intelligence is transparent because it's happening
[14:12.600 --> 14:16.560]  in the real world, and so our credibility is just incredible thanks to the prayers and
[14:16.560 --> 14:20.400]  support and the rest of it, we've got to stay on here now, because we've got to be here
[14:20.400 --> 14:24.360]  to decompartmentalize people in the system so they know how dark this tunnel is, we're
[14:24.360 --> 14:29.120]  going down so we can turn back, oh and start getting into the big story here, with Biden's
[14:29.120 --> 14:34.000]  suppressing that it was a Chinese bio-weapon with the globalist, with the UN for a worldwide
[14:34.000 --> 14:37.720]  power grab, and that's really the big next shoot-a-drop.
[14:37.720 --> 14:42.400]  Well that's it exactly Alex, and they know that this is inevitable, and what you had
[14:42.400 --> 14:48.520]  was a high-ranking Chinese defector, this guy was on the highest levels of the People's
[14:48.520 --> 14:56.400]  Republic of China's intelligence agencies, and he gave the US government over two terabytes
[14:56.400 --> 15:00.840]  of information, and for people that may not be computer savvy, that's basically two entire
[15:00.840 --> 15:05.600]  computers, like if you had a computer in a lab, you put all your data on there and processed
[15:05.600 --> 15:10.280]  all of it, it's like he turned that over, and nobody's even hearing about this.
[15:10.280 --> 15:14.560]  The mainstream news is reporting this, top-level Chinese defector saying, look, here's all
[15:14.560 --> 15:19.080]  the data out of the lab, here's their bio-weapons experiments, here's the Chinese military involved
[15:19.080 --> 15:24.480]  in the Wuhan lab, here's all the data, and the FBI and the DIA have had this intelligence
[15:24.480 --> 15:30.520]  for months, Alex, for months, Alex, and they are sitting on it, because they know, like
[15:30.520 --> 15:35.840]  we've reported, Fauci's involved, Obama's involved, Google's involved, Facebook is involved,
[15:35.840 --> 15:40.200]  so they have to cover all this up while they're sitting on the biggest intelligence that's
[15:40.200 --> 15:46.280]  just raw data from a Chinese defector saying this was indeed a Chinese bio-weapon, here's
[15:46.280 --> 15:50.080]  all their other bio-weapons research, and the Biden administration, the FBI sits on
[15:50.080 --> 15:51.080]  it.
[15:51.080 --> 15:54.640]  And remember, we're going to come back and talk about this, this is a key, I don't want
[15:54.640 --> 15:57.200]  you to read that whole article on there when we come back, because people need to focus
[15:57.200 --> 16:00.440]  on this.
[16:00.440 --> 16:06.560]  Your voice counts, when you share information, be it over the internet or in person, it changes
[16:06.560 --> 16:07.560]  the world.
[16:07.560 --> 16:12.280]  The globalists know their agenda is unpopular, they know you're angry, and now to get around
[16:12.280 --> 16:16.560]  big tech, it's more important than ever that we use every tool we've got.

[17:00.640 --> 17:17.000]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[17:17.000 --> 17:22.760]  Now imagine it broke over a week ago, exactly what we told you.
[17:22.760 --> 17:31.920]  Over a week ago, it came out that the equivalent of the head of the Chinese CIA had given two
[17:31.920 --> 17:37.760]  terabytes of material to the U.S. government because this individual understands it's a
[17:37.760 --> 17:43.520]  war crime to release a bio weapon like COVID-19.
[17:43.520 --> 17:46.360]  Now there's been a total news blackout on this information.
[17:46.360 --> 17:50.280]  We've had it at InfoWars.com, it's been a gateway pundit, it's been in the Daily Mail,
[17:50.280 --> 17:56.760]  it's all confirmed, and the fact that the Communist Chinese military was in there with
[17:56.760 --> 18:01.280]  the U.N., with Gaetz, with Fauci, and from day one when they released this, Fauci and
[18:01.280 --> 18:06.960]  Gaetz always said China was good, America was bad, that their response was good, that
[18:06.960 --> 18:10.200]  our response was bad, that we should never reopen, that they should stay open.
[18:10.200 --> 18:14.680]  This is economic warfare by the globalist, but there are other camps that are aware
[18:14.680 --> 18:20.120]  of this that think this is wrong or standing up, but other whistleblowers are coming out.
[18:20.120 --> 18:25.920]  That's why you've seen the former head of the CDC, the former head of the NIH, that's
[18:25.920 --> 18:31.320]  why you've seen all of these individuals, including now from the FDA, come out and say,
[18:31.320 --> 18:34.760]  yes, this is horrible, this is evil, because they know it was a serious crime that was
[18:34.760 --> 18:40.240]  committed, and if they don't get out ahead of this, they're going to be held responsible
[18:40.240 --> 18:42.160]  when this all comes out.
[18:42.160 --> 18:45.400]  So this is a big, big deal, folks, and I want to explain something.
[18:45.400 --> 18:50.080]  They didn't pull it out of a hat a year and a half ago, and then just turned out to be
[18:50.080 --> 18:51.080]  exactly right.
[18:51.080 --> 18:53.680]  It's well-known what happened at Chapel Hill, it's well-known what Obama did, how he expanded
[18:53.680 --> 18:58.360]  these bio-weapon labs, the scientists in the U.S. protestants said we should not be taking
[18:58.360 --> 19:02.240]  already dangerous pathogens and making them where they can spread to humans, because there's
[19:02.240 --> 19:07.320]  lots of zoological stuff we can get sick from, from animals, but most of it is an airborne.
[19:07.320 --> 19:10.240]  So why are you making an airborne, why are you making it, where it can deliver into the
[19:10.240 --> 19:11.240]  human body?
[19:11.240 --> 19:14.840]  That's a crime, possible by death, by the way, and I'm not calling for killing people.
[19:14.840 --> 19:18.360]  I'm saying that's what the federal law is, and that law makes sense.
[19:18.360 --> 19:23.440]  So it makes it that much more crazy when Frank Figliuzzi is the FBI official spokesperson
[19:23.440 --> 19:28.440]  for the media, he does the official FBI show, it's on NPR this morning, saying I'm under
[19:28.440 --> 19:33.240]  criminal investigation, saying Roger Stone, we need to be arrested, saying two weeks ago
[19:33.240 --> 19:40.840]  we need to quote, what was the exact words he used, we need to attack Congress, members
[19:40.840 --> 19:45.440]  of Congress for radicalizing the people and need to take out their terror networks, and
[19:45.440 --> 19:49.240]  then now that's the official U.S. government policy of Joe Biden.
[19:49.240 --> 19:55.000]  So while his son's selling art for $500,000 a million a piece as a money laundering operation
[19:55.000 --> 19:59.600]  for his dad, for payoffs, and while the borders are wide open and Biden's human smuggling
[19:59.600 --> 20:04.520]  children by the tens of thousands a week, hundreds of thousands a month total now, while
[20:04.520 --> 20:10.520]  all this is going on, Frank Figliuzzi is tweeting yesterday, Alex Jones and Roger Stone are
[20:10.520 --> 20:15.200]  under criminal investigation, he says yes, he's so happy about it.
[20:15.200 --> 20:19.360]  Again, I'm not concerned about being indicted for something I didn't do, I'm concerned
[20:19.360 --> 20:28.000]  that the official FBI has their spokesperson, that's what he is, on CNN, on MSNBC, on NPR,
[20:28.000 --> 20:37.120]  on Twitter licking his lips, looks like Abinadi with a wig, up there to get me instead of
[20:37.120 --> 20:41.000]  the communist Chinese, the bio weapon that's killed millions of people, because some of
[20:41.000 --> 20:44.600]  us go, oh, there is no such thing as viruses, and oh, this isn't real.
[20:44.600 --> 20:46.200]  They're allowed to have their opinions all day, folks.
[20:46.200 --> 20:49.560]  I've been growing up, that's somebody who's sick, cough on me, and I got sick.
[20:49.560 --> 20:52.280]  Viruses are real, bacteria are real, if you're healthy, you can deal with them.
[20:52.280 --> 20:57.960]  The point is, is that it's a real virus they made, and it's only one generation, they've
[20:57.960 --> 21:02.680]  got much more destructive ones, and that's what Senator Paul keeps warning about, why
[21:02.680 --> 21:08.080]  are we doing things that don't have one tenth of one percent kill rate, like COVID-19, which
[21:08.080 --> 21:13.160]  is still bad enough, why, why are we making things that kill 14, 15 percent of people
[21:13.160 --> 21:14.160]  that get it?
[21:14.160 --> 21:18.120]  Hell, they've got mouse pox they tested on other mammals that has like a 90 percent
[21:18.120 --> 21:19.120]  kill rate.
[21:19.120 --> 21:23.480]  Oh yeah, they got stuff that'll fricking eat the pain off your house and give you a permanent
[21:23.480 --> 21:27.680]  orange afro, that's a quote from some movie, I forget the name of it, but I mean, this
[21:27.680 --> 21:28.680]  is deadly serious.
[21:28.680 --> 21:33.520]  So, I want you to get into those articles at InfoWars.com, read about this guy, and
[21:33.520 --> 21:37.280]  the factors of blackout on this, remember I told you months ago, this is coming out
[21:37.280 --> 21:41.800]  about the lab because of whistleblowers, they've got to get ahead of it now, because the stone
[21:41.800 --> 21:42.800]  walling is collapsing.
[21:42.800 --> 21:46.680]  So, another big victory for humanity, but meanwhile the FBI is not trying to stop Chinese
[21:46.680 --> 21:54.680]  spies, they're literally on the FBI spokesperson that hosts the FBI's radio show, licking their
[21:54.680 --> 21:59.320]  lips about trying to have Owen and myself and others arrested for the fiasco at the
[21:59.320 --> 22:03.840]  Capitol and saying Congress people wanted that to happen when we were about to get a
[22:03.840 --> 22:05.640]  vote for a 10 day investigation.
[22:05.640 --> 22:09.600]  That's the last thing we wanted to have happen, but oh, now it's like, oh, he might have talked
[22:09.600 --> 22:14.640]  to a Russian, that was never, now it's like on TV, like Owen said last night, we're not
[22:14.640 --> 22:20.440]  sure that someone that was in DC that week at the ellipse might have talked to a congressperson.
[22:20.440 --> 22:23.880]  So if you went and talked to a congressperson a mile and a half away while there was a speech
[22:23.880 --> 22:27.720]  being given, figliosi and all these people say you should be arrested as a terrorist.
[22:27.720 --> 22:31.400]  So now it's not talking to Russians that gets you arrested, of course, none of that was
[22:31.400 --> 22:32.400]  true either.
[22:32.400 --> 22:36.440]  Now it's oh, the congresspeople are talking to other patriots, we better not talk to
[22:36.440 --> 22:38.600]  each other or the FBI will get us.
[22:38.600 --> 22:43.360]  I mean, how disgustingly corrupt, how are typally evil?
[22:43.360 --> 22:49.920]  I mean, talk about thugs, talk about political intimidators, talk about the KGB, the NKVD,
[22:49.920 --> 22:50.920]  this is it Owen.
[22:50.920 --> 22:55.000]  Well, and that's the danger is once people like this with this type of psychology that
[22:55.000 --> 22:59.280]  have a will to dominate you, you know, you meet a bunch of different people in life.
[22:59.280 --> 23:04.240]  Some people are driven by success, by wealth, by family, by friends, by love, whatever.
[23:04.240 --> 23:06.560]  These people are driven to dominate you.
[23:06.560 --> 23:11.200]  That's their entire will is to dominate you and they're mad scientists at the top.
[23:11.200 --> 23:14.800]  And all these things are just the pillars that hold it up, Alex.
[23:14.800 --> 23:18.040]  So there's been a lot of developments on this story.
[23:18.040 --> 23:22.560]  And what, what, what it really comes down to is yeah, okay, it was a Chinese bio weapon,
[23:22.560 --> 23:29.120]  but I think the bigger story here is Alex, the Chinese clearly have infiltrated every
[23:29.120 --> 23:35.480]  major institution in the United States of America, including the FBI, including the
[23:35.480 --> 23:38.080]  White House, even under Trump.
[23:38.080 --> 23:42.920]  And that's what this story really proves more than anything, Alex, because if you go back
[23:42.920 --> 23:50.600]  to January, 2020, and this even ties into Pelosi, Trump wanted to ban travel from China
[23:50.600 --> 23:52.640]  in January of 2020.
[23:52.640 --> 23:56.800]  This is I'm just going way back before you even get to the current timeline.
[23:56.800 --> 24:03.320]  And so all these Chinese spies, many of them posing as students at major universities,
[24:03.320 --> 24:10.500]  they somehow got the intelligence that Trump was planning on banning travel from China.
[24:10.500 --> 24:16.080]  So all these Chinese spies headed back to mainland China in January of 2020, when Nancy
[24:16.080 --> 24:19.960]  Pelosi went to Chinatown saying, oh, no, no, no, nothing to be worried about, nothing
[24:19.960 --> 24:25.360]  to be worried about, trying to, trying to run cover while Trump is trying to shut down
[24:25.360 --> 24:33.000]  China travel, trying to run cover so all the Chinese spies can get back to China.
[24:33.000 --> 24:39.240]  And so you had Democrats running that operation, trying to delay the travel ban saying racism
[24:39.240 --> 24:42.720]  so that the spies could all get out of town.
[24:42.720 --> 24:46.200]  And so that's why you say, oh, well, now, why are they, why are they saying Trump was
[24:46.200 --> 24:47.200]  bad?
[24:47.200 --> 24:48.200]  He didn't ban it earlier.
[24:48.200 --> 24:49.720]  Why are they making a big deal out of COVID?
[24:49.720 --> 24:52.880]  But here's Nancy Pelosi and come dance in Chinatown.
[24:52.880 --> 24:57.440]  They were running an operation to get all the Chinese spies out.
[24:57.440 --> 24:59.000]  I mean, it's unbelievable.
[24:59.000 --> 25:02.360]  But here's what we learn now, Alex.
[25:02.360 --> 25:08.840]  Not only did the US government have direct intelligence that this was a Chinese man made
[25:08.840 --> 25:10.200]  by a weapon.
[25:10.200 --> 25:16.960]  They have also now been running cover to make sure that this information doesn't get out.
[25:16.960 --> 25:23.520]  So I mean, again, every major institution has been corrupted by Chinese spies.
[25:23.520 --> 25:27.040]  The White House, the FBI, the DIA, all of it, Alex.
[25:27.040 --> 25:33.160]  I mean, this is like, I mean, this is like red flags, like alert, emergency alert.
[25:33.160 --> 25:34.760]  And let's be clear.
[25:34.760 --> 25:39.360]  It's exactly why the globalists set up China to leverage this out economically and to allow
[25:39.360 --> 25:41.960]  them to be the muscle for the globalist.
[25:41.960 --> 25:42.960]  I don't even blame the Chinese.
[25:42.960 --> 25:44.400]  I want to be totally clear.
[25:44.400 --> 25:46.520]  I don't want war with China.
[25:46.520 --> 25:48.560]  I don't like the Communist Party that's in charge.
[25:48.560 --> 25:49.960]  The Chinese people are good people.
[25:49.960 --> 25:54.160]  But when I come back, I'm going to explain that the globalists have set up this whole
[25:54.160 --> 25:55.160]  conflict with China.
[25:55.160 --> 26:00.960]  There's got to be a way out of it.
[26:00.960 --> 26:05.560]  At the same time, I think the Moon is right behind the moon.
[26:05.560 --> 26:07.760]  Kylin, first of all, let me say I love your products.
[26:07.760 --> 26:12.940]  I am a granny and for all the senior citizens out there that may have spent a lifetime in
[26:12.940 --> 26:18.500]  the sun like me, I was loaded up with sunspots or age spots as they're lovingly called.
[26:18.500 --> 26:23.760]  But since taking your X-2 for the last couple of years, my skin is just really gorgeous,
[26:23.760 --> 26:24.760]  actually.
[26:24.760 --> 26:27.780]  People think I'm 55 years old.
[26:27.780 --> 26:31.860]  And I was already taking your other supplements, but I thought, you know, well, maybe that's
[26:31.860 --> 26:36.140]  what I need to do, because I just thought it was a hopeless situation, but when I started
[26:36.140 --> 26:41.100]  taking it, I mean, it doesn't happen immediately, but, you know, over a period of time, I started
[26:41.100 --> 26:46.220]  noticing, okay, you know, this is a ticket, this is working, this is wonderful, you know,
[26:46.220 --> 26:52.700]  I don't have to put on derma blend anymore, you know, so anyway, it worked wonderfully,
[26:52.700 --> 26:56.940]  and it really has totally cleared up my skin.
[26:56.940 --> 27:00.460]  All the evil men in Taurus seem to flourish as the good men do nothing.
[27:00.460 --> 27:02.380]  Well, I'm trying to be a good man.
[27:02.380 --> 27:07.300]  I'm trying to stand up to the right thing, and I've seen huge effects with what we've
[27:07.300 --> 27:12.140]  done here in InfoWars, other good men and women getting together and telling the truth
[27:12.140 --> 27:16.260]  and standing up to corruption, but now the globals are coming after us, and so I need
[27:16.260 --> 27:17.260]  your prayers.
[27:17.260 --> 27:18.260]  I need your financial support.

[27:57.220 --> 28:03.940]  Big Pharma was born out of the Rockefeller oil industry in 1900 with the petrochemical.
[28:03.940 --> 28:10.180]  The petrochemical then dominated two major industries, plastics and drugs.
[28:10.180 --> 28:15.340]  Companies began synthesizing patented versions of naturally sourced drugs.
[28:15.340 --> 28:21.380]  The natural sources were then made illegal, pharmaceuticals became medicine, and the sicker
[28:21.380 --> 28:24.220]  people got, the more their industry grew.
[28:24.220 --> 28:28.020]  It's a death cult, and it's up to the individual to escape.
[28:28.020 --> 28:34.460]  Good health begins with a healthy immune system, which needs the proper nutrients to thrive.
[28:34.460 --> 28:37.980]  Nutrients we cannot readily get from our food today.
[28:37.980 --> 28:43.020]  The combinations of vitamin C and zinc and vitamin D3 with calcium have been proven to
[28:43.020 --> 28:47.340]  be what we need to maintain a healthy immune system.
[28:47.340 --> 28:52.460]  Go to InfoWarsStore.com and start supporting your natural immune system now with the Mega

[29:17.900 --> 29:23.820]  The truth is there are a lot of really powerful different factions who all want global government,
[29:23.820 --> 29:28.740]  who all want to play God, who all want to legalize testing all sorts of horrible genetic engineering
[29:28.740 --> 29:34.020]  on the public, because they're selfish and want the fruits of that experimentation, life
[29:34.020 --> 29:39.660]  extension, immortality, and that's the holy grail of why they're doing all this, why they
[29:39.660 --> 29:44.620]  think they're God, and they see us just wanting to go play football or go watch TV and think
[29:44.620 --> 29:47.460]  we're idiots and deserve to die.
[29:47.460 --> 29:53.500]  The scientific elite, the mad scientist that run things, see us as animals, but what they
[29:53.500 --> 29:59.340]  need to understand is in the process of them trying to play God, a lot of us aren't acting
[29:59.340 --> 30:04.580]  like animals, a lot of us do exercise our will, and we're not going to sit here and
[30:04.580 --> 30:08.820]  take what they're doing, okay, and we're not going to take our free will being violated,
[30:08.820 --> 30:13.140]  we're not going to take the Nuremberg Code that just codifies our national rights that
[30:13.140 --> 30:19.620]  are already there, and if they assault us with their biological pollution and their
[30:19.620 --> 30:23.820]  mad scientist crap, we're going to take back control of our governments, we're going to
[30:23.820 --> 30:27.660]  indict you, and we're going to have you found guilty, and then we're going to have you march
[30:27.660 --> 30:32.100]  up on a gallows, and we're going to open a trap door and break your damn neck, and I
[30:32.100 --> 30:36.220]  don't talk about killing people that tough, you need to stop killing people, you need
[30:36.220 --> 30:42.020]  to stop playing God, you need to stop pushing it, because I am not going to sit here and
[30:42.020 --> 30:48.020]  watch you run rampant over everybody, you're going to end up getting killed, that's how
[30:48.020 --> 30:53.260]  this works, that's how you start wars.
[30:53.260 --> 30:57.740]  Remember folks, we project our decency on the globalists, these are mad scientists who
[30:57.740 --> 31:04.580]  have been in these agencies like Fauci for 45 years that thinks he's God, and you see
[31:04.580 --> 31:09.420]  Fauci on the news again today, it's on infowars.com saying, questioning me is questioning science,
[31:09.420 --> 31:14.820]  you cannot question me, the essence of science is questioning, well he's not talking about
[31:14.820 --> 31:20.460]  the real science, ladies and gentlemen, of what temperature water boils at, or the periodic
[31:20.460 --> 31:26.140]  table, or the speed of light, he's talking about his scientific dictatorship and the
[31:26.140 --> 31:29.380]  world he's establishing and going through, so I want to read through some of that article,
[31:29.380 --> 31:33.860]  because we covered it some last week, it's gotten almost no attention, next week's news
[31:33.860 --> 31:39.580]  today, the fact that they have this defector, and Biden's trying to figure out how he wants
[31:39.580 --> 31:44.220]  to use this against China to get out from under their full control, he's been a Chinese
[31:44.220 --> 31:51.420]  agent, but without burning up his networks, well we want it all out to burn up Gates politically,
[31:51.420 --> 31:55.940]  to be able to go after Fauci legally and lawfully, so all the rest of these mad scientists get
[31:55.940 --> 32:01.100]  the fear of God into them, let's just remember, keep hammering this, six years ago it was
[32:01.100 --> 32:07.500]  in hundreds of publications, I had top scientist on, I had Dr. Boyle at the time saying they've
[32:07.500 --> 32:12.780]  got 14 level four bio weapons labs that we know of in the United States, and a bunch
[32:12.780 --> 32:19.540]  of other places doing level four type stuff that is illegal, and it's dangerous as hell,
[32:19.540 --> 32:24.900]  and it's going to end up getting out, and that's what's happened, I mean they had a
[32:24.900 --> 32:30.340]  hurricane in Florida 20 years ago, and one of those little tiger fish, or two of those
[32:30.340 --> 32:34.300]  tiger fish got out, and now they're all over the Caribbean killing most of the other fish,
[32:34.300 --> 32:39.980]  like cockroaches, well that's a fish that got out and is causing all sorts of problems,
[32:39.980 --> 32:45.500]  this stuff is out of control, and if they can release this stuff and then be the saviors
[32:45.500 --> 32:49.540]  and control the narrative and censor everybody, they're going to do more of it, this is just
[32:49.540 --> 32:53.380]  the beginning of the psychotic great reset, I'm going to say this again, I have footage
[32:53.380 --> 32:58.460]  of that camera man sitting 10 feet from me shot yesterday that even blew him away, and
[32:58.460 --> 33:04.380]  he's not even really political, and my crew who were a bunch of off duty NYPD, they were
[33:04.380 --> 33:08.460]  blown away, because they're smart guys, but just average guys who aren't even trying
[33:08.460 --> 33:13.460]  to be political either, they're like what is this, it says we're going to live in communes
[33:13.460 --> 33:21.620]  and it showed where you live in a commune and it's in a cage, it's in a dirt bunker,
[33:21.620 --> 33:27.060]  and it says you will live in a commune, and it says you will own nothing and have nothing,
[33:27.060 --> 33:35.900]  whenever we show that video, that's from the UN, so this isn't a game, and I see how domesticated
[33:35.900 --> 33:41.100]  and how passive and how weak the general population is and how emasculated they are, and then
[33:41.100 --> 33:45.180]  how the women are trying to act on power and you're walking around like they're the men,
[33:45.180 --> 33:49.780]  when they're all just idiots manipulated by the globalist, chemically in utero, hit with
[33:49.780 --> 33:55.180]  chemicals to emasculate men, which is now mainstream news, so this is just a disaster,
[33:55.180 --> 33:59.220]  it's an apocalypse, but we're going through the process of awakening and the minute we
[33:59.220 --> 34:03.260]  awaken and say no, that's it for the globalist, so when the time we've got left, get back
[34:03.260 --> 34:07.060]  into this big defector and then I want to segue into that other news that you brought
[34:07.060 --> 34:12.900]  up and also the social war that's the other side of the equation, because this whole take
[34:12.900 --> 34:17.460]  over of the family, take over of free speech, take over of the churches, everybody's got
[34:17.460 --> 34:22.700]  to lower whatever their flag was and hoist up that rainbow flag, that again, if Hitler
[34:22.700 --> 34:25.940]  would have had a rainbow flag, he would have won, no I'm not joking, if he'd have worn
[34:25.940 --> 34:29.740]  a pink suit, he would have won, if he'd have had lipstick on, people wouldn't have taken
[34:29.740 --> 34:33.620]  it seriously, he would have won, these people have camouflage, in fact I ought to do a
[34:33.620 --> 34:38.460]  piece where I'd dress up in a rainbow outfit and chop people up with hatchets, I mean not
[34:38.460 --> 34:43.700]  for real but theoretically, because if I stabbed you with a knife, had a rainbow blade, would
[34:43.700 --> 34:44.700]  it be okay?
[34:44.700 --> 34:49.820]  Had a black blade, it's more scary, Darth Vader's big tall and black and he looks ominous,
[34:49.820 --> 34:54.220]  what if Darth Vader was rainbow colored, well you know and he'd say I'm going to stick my
[34:54.220 --> 34:57.540]  lightsaber in you, it's gay and you're like but I don't want to die and he goes but it's
[34:57.540 --> 35:02.140]  gay, I run death camps, I'm gay, you understand how that works?
[35:02.140 --> 35:07.060]  They literally hide their whole corporate evil behind this stuff, I'm a shroyer.
[35:07.060 --> 35:12.980]  Well it's just incredible that we're witnessing this Alex and like you said, it's hard to
[35:12.980 --> 35:16.820]  say it but as soon as people realize this and this is why they're so scared of January
[35:16.820 --> 35:20.940]  6th, I mean Americans are going to be turned into savages when they realize what's been
[35:20.940 --> 35:23.660]  done to them, what's been done to their family, what's been done to their country and that's
[35:23.660 --> 35:28.580]  why they're so panicked over that tiny little uprising on January 6th, it's a tiny little
[35:28.580 --> 35:32.020]  inscobible of what America is going to do.
[35:32.020 --> 35:36.020]  You're right, it was that image of a million people who weren't attacking the Capitol that
[35:36.020 --> 35:38.660]  if we would have wanted to take it, nobody could have stopped us and the country would
[35:38.660 --> 35:42.020]  be ours because they're the revolutionaries taking the country through fraud and there
[35:42.020 --> 35:45.620]  they see the rightful Americans, they're every race, color, and creed, it's that image that's
[35:45.620 --> 35:48.660]  scared the hell out of them that if we really wanted to have an insurrection, we'd have
[35:48.660 --> 35:53.140]  taken the whole damn city, the government would have quote fallen to us, the military
[35:53.140 --> 35:57.060]  and police would have joined us instantly but we didn't do it so they tried to trick
[35:57.060 --> 36:00.460]  us into a limited level of that so we'd lose our power.
[36:00.460 --> 36:04.180]  And I'm one of those people that likes, I like to play golf, I like to have a cold
[36:04.180 --> 36:08.580]  beer at a ball game and so I don't want to see America turn into that, it's just, you
[36:08.580 --> 36:11.380]  know, when people realize what's been done to them, there's going to be a response but
[36:11.380 --> 36:15.940]  so let's get into the story, Alex, and you see here's why it's so important for us to
[36:15.940 --> 36:21.780]  talk about this and you to have your historical reference point because you started at my
[36:21.780 --> 36:26.580]  final conclusion of just reading all these headlines which was the way the globalists
[36:26.580 --> 36:30.020]  have set up the new global market, the new global economy under the global government
[36:30.020 --> 36:35.460]  is to have China with basically all the real blackmail against nation states, not Epstein
[36:35.460 --> 36:40.820]  running sex stuff but no, China has 99% of the rare earth minerals, China has 90% of
[36:40.820 --> 36:45.540]  the world's manufacturing and production, soon China will be the only source to even
[36:45.540 --> 36:49.900]  get energy out of at this rate since it's all being cut off so then it's like, oh you
[36:49.900 --> 36:54.460]  can go to China as, let's say, as if Biden was a real guy and he'd say, well China, you
[36:54.460 --> 36:57.980]  have all these spies here, you know, we're kicking them out and we're going to take recourse,
[36:57.980 --> 37:00.860]  well China would just say, okay fine, you're not getting any rare earth minerals, you're
[37:00.860 --> 37:04.180]  not getting any energy, you're not getting any manufacturing, so good luck with that
[37:04.180 --> 37:08.940]  and then of course the western leader would stand down, that would be a scenario if they
[37:08.940 --> 37:13.260]  weren't already compromised but so Alex, quickly here in the last 90 seconds, let me just kind
[37:13.260 --> 37:18.540]  of do the boil down here and we can get more into this in the next segment but it started
[37:18.540 --> 37:23.540]  with this story out of red state, high ranking Chinese defector has direct knowledge of several
[37:23.540 --> 37:28.700]  Chinese special weapons programs, not only did he turn over terabytes of information to
[37:28.700 --> 37:34.500]  the federal government, the DIA, the FBI, the Biden administration, he was also whistleblowing
[37:34.500 --> 37:40.260]  that there were Chinese spies inside of all of these federal agencies as well and now
[37:40.260 --> 37:45.300]  that we're learning new details, we're starting to connect the dots of where these Chinese
[37:45.300 --> 37:52.060]  spies are at, where their influence is being felt, in the news, in social media, in the
[37:52.060 --> 37:58.100]  democrat party, in the republican party, in congress, in FBI, in the rest of these things
[37:58.100 --> 38:03.020]  and so here's just some of the follow up stories, high ranking Chinese defector working with
[38:03.020 --> 38:09.900]  DIA has direct knowledge of Chinese bio weapons programs, why is the DIA covering that up?
[38:09.900 --> 38:15.100]  Chinese defector was shielded from FBI leadership and other agencies because of concerns that
[38:15.100 --> 38:19.220]  they are deep state entities who would try to bury the information and in other words
[38:19.220 --> 38:25.180]  the Chinese defector knows there's Chinese spies in all of these agencies and our people
[38:25.180 --> 38:27.900]  aren't even smart enough to figure that out.
[38:27.900 --> 38:31.620]  Chinese defector claims to have evidence that Chinese military coordinated creation and
[38:31.620 --> 38:36.740]  release of COVID-19, yes we know that now, defector claiming Chinese military responsible
[38:36.740 --> 38:42.420]  for COVID-19 identified as top counterintelligence official so that's the new one is that it's
[38:42.420 --> 38:46.980]  now official, it's not a theory, oh this is a top, maybe it's a top Chinese guy, no,
[38:46.980 --> 38:53.540]  he was one of the top ranking ones Alex, we have terabytes of type top Chinese bio weapons
[38:53.540 --> 38:55.780]  research and the FBI is covering it up.

[43:18.060 --> 43:22.140]  all right so welcome back the alex jones show we're about to bow out here go to these reports
[43:22.140 --> 43:28.620]  i want lawyers to take over i wanted to get into the social war on our children i know everybody
[43:28.620 --> 43:34.060]  knows this is happening but when you're in a city like new york or san francisco you really see it
[43:34.060 --> 43:40.300]  it is the culture it is you will give up you're a man you will give up you're a woman uh we you
[43:40.300 --> 43:47.900]  will let our special boards control all speech i mean this is a dangerous evil cult and the people
[43:47.900 --> 43:53.580]  here don't want to be in it but they're very weak uh and they've been brought up and been
[43:53.580 --> 43:58.860]  to conform and been brainwashed and people just happen to start saying no to all this but going
[43:58.860 --> 44:05.980]  back to this uh head of a major chinese intelligence agency their agencies are so secret
[44:05.980 --> 44:12.460]  that we have names for them uh giving them all the data and that's because the infiltration goes
[44:12.460 --> 44:16.540]  both ways when we hear the fbi doesn't want to know about chinese infiltration it's because the
[44:16.540 --> 44:21.740]  globalists set shine up with 98 percent of our earth men roles and everything else where china's
[44:21.740 --> 44:26.300]  been allowed to operate above the law and so there's so much investment there that's like we're
[44:26.300 --> 44:32.140]  signing these twins that are attached to each other and that's how a global system works it's
[44:32.140 --> 44:36.940]  how a takeover happens is the old days they'd have the daughter and the son of the two empires would
[44:36.940 --> 44:42.620]  marry and that's how they would merge their empires and it's basically china's been set up to take
[44:42.620 --> 44:48.380]  the world over not to empower other people but to basically lower us to their level of slavery to
[44:48.380 --> 44:53.180]  set that standard the giant sucking sound that ross perot talked about so accurately back in 1992
[44:53.740 --> 45:01.420]  has now come to fruition 21 years later 22 years later i guess 30 years later
[45:01.980 --> 45:08.220]  man time's flying i'm getting old yeah 28 years later there you go so oh and finish up with that
[45:08.220 --> 45:11.500]  and i've got a few other big points i want to hit here it's just that people need to realize
[45:11.500 --> 45:16.300]  this isn't well-meaning liberals this isn't confused different projects and operations
[45:16.940 --> 45:21.980]  this is you will live in communal homes you will have nothing you will own nothing you will be
[45:21.980 --> 45:30.540]  sterilized to get your credit authorized to get your social credit uh green lit that's why they're
[45:30.540 --> 45:37.500]  pushing reparations for black people has nothing to do with reparations uh for black people it has
[45:37.500 --> 45:41.820]  to do with a universal basic income because once quote oh black people are going to get a basic
[45:41.820 --> 45:47.900]  income but that comes with strings attached of the inoculations and the control as they devalue
[45:47.900 --> 45:52.060]  the currencies and so you'll sell your rights out for a couple thousand dollars a month but it'll
[45:52.060 --> 45:56.380]  be like a couple hundred dollars a month when they're done and so that's what's really happening is
[45:57.180 --> 46:02.060]  uh again a targeted transference of wealth a targeted breakdown of egalitarian societies
[46:02.060 --> 46:10.300]  a breaking of the of the social construct of the social contract and so this is organized scientific
[46:10.300 --> 46:15.980]  evil to take humans out of their natural environment dumb us down and basically make us obsolete
[46:15.980 --> 46:22.300]  and they're using the whole liberal safety net nanny state as the cover for it so it appears
[46:22.300 --> 46:26.380]  non-threatening on the surface uh but they have gone full operational i've said this a thousand
[46:26.380 --> 46:34.620]  times but being here in new york i mean staggering staggering transhumanist great reset artwork is
[46:34.620 --> 46:41.500]  all over the place the american flags are gone the flag of the world government is up the rainbow
[46:41.500 --> 46:45.660]  flag uh but just finish up with that point and then when you had another big topic we were gonna
[46:45.660 --> 46:50.620]  hit together and then you're gonna take over well there's just so much to get into i mean i i've
[46:50.620 --> 46:56.460]  got these other stories just talking about what you're describing the social engineering where you
[46:56.460 --> 47:03.420]  now have manhattan city council members that are in dominatrix porn films uh you also have
[47:03.420 --> 47:09.980]  the same groups that cancel fourth of july parades and fireworks now launching lgbtq pride events so
[47:09.980 --> 47:16.540]  you know it just shows you the agenda but back to the story alex you know the biden administration
[47:16.540 --> 47:22.700]  the fbi the di a and anybody who's involved with this chinese defector right now don jin we
[47:23.660 --> 47:30.060]  the top chinese official the vice minister my vice minister secretary uh of beijing
[47:31.580 --> 47:36.940]  who is telling the u.s government this was made in a lab the chinese military knew about it they
[47:36.940 --> 47:42.380]  released it as a bio weapon here's all their other bio weapons research well all the corrupt
[47:42.380 --> 47:47.100]  officials and biden who's who's corrupt but corrupted by the chinese too blackmailed by
[47:47.100 --> 47:51.420]  the chinese with all his secret deals they don't know what to do because there's probably some
[47:51.420 --> 47:55.900]  good people in there alex that are like hey we got this defector from china he gave us two terabytes
[47:55.900 --> 48:00.300]  of information and then they're probably scratching their heads like why are these fbi officials why
[48:00.300 --> 48:04.540]  are these di officials why why is the biden administration stalling this why are they
[48:04.540 --> 48:11.020]  trying to cover up this rollout and so i mean seriously this guy needs to be like under suicide
[48:11.020 --> 48:15.980]  watch not because he's going to commit suicide but because he could get epstein at any moment
[48:15.980 --> 48:23.260]  they have to cover this up alex this is no one bombshell well absolutely and again this was done
[48:23.260 --> 48:27.660]  strategically to get rid of trump they released it out of wuhan but we need to understand and
[48:27.660 --> 48:32.060]  let the chinese people know let the world know it's not just china because they're gonna try to say
[48:32.060 --> 48:37.900]  oh it's just china no this was done because it was outlawed in the u.s obama got in trouble good
[48:37.900 --> 48:43.980]  u.s scientists just like this whistleblower in china said hey we shouldn't be doing this you you
[48:43.980 --> 48:49.820]  sure as hell shouldn't be doing it had a college laboratory it needs to be outlawed so obama
[48:49.820 --> 48:54.380]  moved it and listen i talked to the people involved okay i'm gonna leave it at that
[48:55.180 --> 49:01.820]  a couple months ago and i said you will soon see seth rogan come out the washington post
[49:01.820 --> 49:08.300]  and say fouchi's bad and yeah i came out of the lab but that's going to be a limited operation
[49:09.020 --> 49:16.220]  to act like it was an accident or to act like it was just fouchi no it's the communist chinese
[49:16.220 --> 49:21.100]  government with the corrupt elements of the u.s government through the global government project
[49:21.100 --> 49:26.940]  of the un the u.s government the chinese government doing this to put the un in place as the world
[49:26.940 --> 49:31.260]  government that dictates our medicine that dictates the lockdowns that dictates the contact
[49:31.260 --> 49:38.140]  tracers to establish and transfer nationhood and power and elected governmental officials
[49:38.140 --> 49:43.260]  into a multinational un unelected system controlled by corporations so this is a
[49:43.260 --> 49:49.660]  corptocracy this is a fascist corporate takeover that's put all its you know eggs in the chinese
[49:49.660 --> 49:54.860]  basket that is pretty much already taken the world over that now has multi quadrillions
[49:54.860 --> 50:00.140]  in fake currencies they're buying everything up at 50 to 100 times what its value because it's all
[50:00.140 --> 50:05.500]  workless and by the time that trickles down the inflation it's going to devastate everybody
[50:05.500 --> 50:11.100]  where we're left with no jobs no security no savings inflated currency that doesn't work and
[50:11.100 --> 50:16.300]  the globalists own everything and they admit that's their plan and hiding behind it are these big
[50:16.300 --> 50:22.060]  corporations that run death camps on china but oh jim cooks gay and there's rainbow flags and
[50:22.060 --> 50:25.900]  all the major corporates most persons are black people what's great it'd be abnormal that was
[50:25.900 --> 50:30.780]  the case case fine have every corporate having a black person but a t&t's not black apple's not
[50:30.780 --> 50:38.460]  black uh the new world order is not black the gg pink they hide and they admit they're hiding behind
[50:38.460 --> 50:43.420]  it because the general public literally thinks that who the spokesperson is of something is who
[50:43.420 --> 50:49.500]  they are uh so i mean if hitler i guess would have hired maybe uh if hitler was alive today he'd
[50:49.500 --> 50:54.300]  hire lebron james as a spokesperson because gg pink's is bad as hitler probably worse on a mass scale
[50:54.300 --> 51:00.140]  but instead the mba just you know through china is their biggest sponsor now controls lebron james
[51:00.140 --> 51:03.740]  so lebron james says i don't care if three million wiggers are in death camps i don't care if a
[51:03.740 --> 51:07.900]  million christians are in death camps because he's getting 20 30 40 50 million year in extor
[51:07.900 --> 51:13.660]  from just sponsorship out of china and so here you got this big you know six foot nine black guy
[51:13.660 --> 51:20.620]  is literally the front guy for uh china why do you think kim jong-un wanted all these black players
[51:20.620 --> 51:25.900]  they're over there with him in north korea these guys are smart man and they know that what they
[51:25.900 --> 51:30.780]  see american culture is supposedly black because the because the corporate media did that to hide
[51:30.780 --> 51:35.260]  themselves and the chinese and others know the u.s has the best propaganda so they go oh yeah we're
[51:35.260 --> 51:39.420]  black too and this is like if i put a blackface on and went and robbed a bank and shot and killed
[51:39.420 --> 51:43.340]  10 people they'd say a black guy did it but you go well you're setting blacks up well they are
[51:43.340 --> 51:48.460]  setting blacks up they're putting their whole agenda of world government new world order transgenderism
[51:48.460 --> 51:54.460]  everything with a black face on it and a rainbow flag and man they got people adopting that here in
[51:54.460 --> 52:00.860]  new york i mean i've never seen what i've seen here where the black men all basically 80 percent
[52:00.860 --> 52:05.820]  of act like women talk like women and and and run around you know doing that and that's what
[52:05.820 --> 52:11.660]  that's what people say oh black lives matter is crazy run by soros where it says uh we're
[52:11.660 --> 52:16.300]  going to get rid of the family nuclear family and we want black men to transition you're like that
[52:16.300 --> 52:22.860]  just sounds crazy let me tell you they've done it i'm maybe not 60 percent of the black men i've seen
[52:22.860 --> 52:28.620]  80 percent of the young ones i've seen are trying to look and act like women and man i mean it freaks
[52:28.620 --> 52:34.220]  me out because i know it's affected and i know that they've been told we will accept you we will
[52:34.220 --> 52:40.140]  employ you we will make you managers as long as you don't have a woman and as long as you act like
[52:40.140 --> 52:44.700]  you're a woman talk about the emasculation talk about the enslavement and i'm not here
[52:44.700 --> 52:48.380]  virtue signaling that black people what they've done to black people they're doing it to everybody
[52:48.380 --> 52:52.220]  but i look what they've done to them being captured going back 120 years ago with margaret
[52:52.220 --> 52:57.100]  sanger and the rockfellers right here in new york and all their psychological studies and we're 120
[52:57.100 --> 53:04.060]  years into this and i see the result of it oh and and it is pure nightmarish death well that's why
[53:04.060 --> 53:09.020]  u.s corporations go along with all of this because they know that most of the goods that they profit
[53:09.020 --> 53:13.500]  off of are made in china so they go along with it that's why lebron james goes along with this he
[53:13.500 --> 53:18.940]  knows his shoes are made in china he wants his movies to be in china and that's why you know
[53:18.940 --> 53:23.020]  when kanye west was kind of reaching this new point this new threshold in his career he was like
[53:23.020 --> 53:26.940]  wait a second i don't want my shoes made in china what my shoes made in the u.s that's when they
[53:26.940 --> 53:32.140]  started demonizing him so you see as soon as you don't want to be a part of this globalist new
[53:32.140 --> 53:36.460]  world order that screws the little guy screws over your neighbor all of a sudden you get attacked
[53:36.460 --> 53:40.940]  you're the bad guy why because again china runs the media i mean it's just it's just incredible
[53:40.940 --> 53:45.260]  alex and that's kind of a low-level understanding of it but that's the easiest one to consume well
[53:45.260 --> 53:49.740]  that's it you're dead on the back all the time and i really really appreciate it but i want you to
[53:49.740 --> 53:56.300]  understand something don't put the horse in front of the cart here don't put the wagon in front of

[55:46.540 --> 56:02.460]  you so much you're listening to the alex jones show
[56:08.860 --> 56:14.380]  all right final segment here alex jones i'm sure it's about to take over uh john bound always does
[56:14.380 --> 56:23.180]  really important reports he's done one on juneteenth and how it's been weaponized uh and he did uh one
[56:23.180 --> 56:28.300]  on another big important subject hunter biden just to show how the corruption works one of the biggest
[56:28.300 --> 56:34.140]  ways to launder money one of the biggest ways to pay off politicians is their wife's an artist
[56:34.140 --> 56:39.740]  and oh it's subjective you buy her painting for half a million dollars and then uh you know the
[56:39.740 --> 56:44.220]  mayor does what you want on the land deal or whatever uh he's selling him these paintings they can
[56:44.220 --> 56:49.580]  never sell before as fast as you can for half a million a million dollars it just shows the insane
[56:49.580 --> 56:56.540]  level of corruption and what's happening and how the system wants to make america as dysfunctional
[56:56.540 --> 57:02.060]  as they can but not just the united states the entire world and if we just make them conscious of
[57:02.060 --> 57:07.100]  that we can change it so i hope that uh oh and has time to air those reports i know he's got a lot
[57:07.100 --> 57:11.500]  on his slate a lot of guests and also taking calls is always really important uh we're going to have
[57:11.500 --> 57:17.340]  some amazing reports for you it'll take a couple days to get them out um but i would imagine that uh
[57:18.940 --> 57:23.740]  sometime next week we'll put out this this this big special report that really answers a lot of
[57:23.740 --> 57:28.620]  questions and strikes the heart of the new order and who runs it and and and how to stop it that
[57:28.620 --> 57:32.940]  should be out sometime early next week um but i want to take some time to voice it and you know
[57:32.940 --> 57:37.740]  add a lot because we put a lot of work into it i want to add some clips and you know you're really
[57:38.540 --> 57:42.220]  kind of a mini documentary about what's happened here in new york uh separately i'll tell you what's
[57:42.220 --> 57:50.380]  not made in china we could source and get all the supplements we want out of china but they're dirty
[57:50.380 --> 57:55.660]  and they're and they've got problems and and and they're they're they're they're adulterated uh and
[57:55.660 --> 58:00.460]  so so we could sell our products at a fraction of the price we do but instead we source them in
[58:00.460 --> 58:05.180]  north america some of the stuff comes from europe some of it from uh south america but it's from the
[58:05.180 --> 58:12.540]  top apothecaries you know the top good facilities in the world uh and so it doesn't come from china
[58:12.540 --> 58:16.380]  i'll tell you when it comes to shortwave radios they're all from china you can't find them
[58:16.380 --> 58:19.980]  we just saw grundig that was made in germany that went out of business like 10 years ago
[58:19.980 --> 58:23.580]  i was a grundig dealer and people didn't buy them grundig's it went out of business so
[58:23.580 --> 58:28.140]  when people say to trump hey why are your ties made in chinese like uh they'd be three times more
[58:28.140 --> 58:33.820]  they were made america i'm trying to do a deal where it would be half the cost uh that it currently
[58:33.820 --> 58:39.340]  is in america still more expensive than china and he did that but then those unfair deals that he
[58:39.340 --> 58:45.260]  got rid of have been put right back in place so that's how this whole scam operates most of our
[58:45.260 --> 58:50.140]  products are made right here in america the t-shirts are textile here in america they are
[58:50.140 --> 58:54.220]  printed here in america i think some of the textiles we use sometimes if there's a shortage
[58:54.220 --> 58:59.260]  because of the shutdown we had to buy some from like honduras we got some from vietnam but they're
[58:59.260 --> 59:03.900]  becoming more capitalist i mean that's another problem we've experienced with the covid lockdown
[59:03.900 --> 59:09.980]  is the economies that aren't command and control like like china when they shut down for over a year
[59:09.980 --> 59:14.460]  most of our companies that we were getting supply from couldn't supply anymore and so that causes
[59:14.460 --> 59:18.460]  supply chain breakdown that's why the products we do have we need folks to get them plus they're
[59:18.460 --> 59:24.700]  great products because that funds our operation and so there's a lot of great deals at infowarstore.com
[59:24.700 --> 59:28.940]  but while you're there you got some great new t-shirts that are out not just save the frogs
[59:28.940 --> 59:33.100]  but some other ones that that are really great conversation pieces it takes a lot of money
[59:33.740 --> 59:38.300]  especially in this inflationary economy as you know to stay on air you can also support us you
[59:38.300 --> 59:43.420]  can donate right at the top of infowarstore.com and you can just see support us become a sponsor
[59:43.420 --> 59:48.540]  and that's viewers like you listeners like you go give five dollars twenty dollars a hundred dollars
[59:48.540 --> 59:52.700]  sign up consecutively each month canceling time for free but that way you don't forget each month
[59:52.700 --> 59:57.500]  to give us ten dollars that way we get nine dollars and fifty cents or whatever because there's some
[59:57.500 --> 1:00:03.100]  fees instead of just you know making thirty forty percent off of say we sell some vitamins and minerals
[1:00:03.100 --> 1:00:09.020]  for thirty bucks and then we get like you know twelve thirteen dollars that sounds great but then
[1:00:09.020 --> 1:00:14.380]  we discount even less and then after all the overhead all the issues i end up spending a lot of my
[1:00:14.380 --> 1:00:18.140]  time is trying to raise funds which i'm not complaining about i'm just saying we're doing
[1:00:18.140 --> 1:00:22.700]  important work and i want to thank you all for your support but just remember infowarstore.com
[1:00:22.700 --> 1:00:28.380]  and and and while you're there sign up for auto ship that way you can cancel any time order out
[1:00:28.380 --> 1:00:32.860]  every month every two months every three months that way products you really like keep coming back
[1:00:32.860 --> 1:00:37.900]  in don't want to get anymore just cancel it it's free but that way it's on auto ship as well so you
[1:00:37.900 --> 1:00:42.300]  keep supporting us and don't forget because i'm really bad about supporting something i want to
[1:00:42.300 --> 1:00:45.820]  support and then getting busy and forgetting about it and then you turn around and it's gone
[1:00:45.820 --> 1:00:49.660]  like oh i love that restaurant well now folks didn't go there it shut down please keep us on
[1:00:49.660 --> 1:00:58.060]  here i'm sure it takes over right now i'm up here working on a thursday night in mid april 2021
[1:00:58.700 --> 1:01:02.460]  and i just want to say something i am so blessed and honored to work with this incredible crew
[1:01:03.180 --> 1:01:07.180]  that has come together over the years and is truly an answer to prayer and i am so blessed and

[1:02:09.180 --> 1:02:17.740]  defending the republic from enemies foreign and domestic it's alex jones and now your host
[1:02:17.740 --> 1:02:26.540]  owin treuer into the second hour of this alex jones show
[1:02:29.020 --> 1:02:36.620]  and you know i did all of this work to prepare for today i'm going to be
[1:02:36.620 --> 1:02:43.340]  hosting the war room as well so that i understood this story about the chinese defector and the
[1:02:43.340 --> 1:02:50.860]  latest developments and and that i could come on here today and be very eloquent and coherent
[1:02:52.780 --> 1:02:57.660]  and decisive in my explanation and coverage of this but you know you get onto the stage and you
[1:02:57.660 --> 1:03:02.380]  have it and you have all the prep work and it's just like i can't really do it justice
[1:03:04.460 --> 1:03:09.820]  again this is the type of information that info wars has to cover on air
[1:03:09.820 --> 1:03:16.940]  and so then there's like all this other psychological stuff that goes on behind it and it's like why they
[1:03:16.940 --> 1:03:27.100]  want to attack alex jones but it's like this is beyond my pay grade this is the kind of stuff
[1:03:27.100 --> 1:03:33.100]  that jens sake should be telling you about but she's a joke she's a clown and she quite frankly
[1:03:33.100 --> 1:03:36.540]  she doesn't even know what's going on the bite administration doesn't even communicate with her
[1:03:36.540 --> 1:03:39.900]  so yeah she gets up there she can't answer questions because she doesn't know she has
[1:03:39.900 --> 1:03:44.060]  no idea her job is to stand up there like a clown and take questions from the media when
[1:03:44.060 --> 1:03:52.860]  she has no clue what's going on but so here we are and info wars and and thank god for the others
[1:03:52.860 --> 1:04:03.180]  that are breaking this and reporting this they are out there but it should be universal
[1:04:03.180 --> 1:04:11.980]  in the american media and it's not and and i wonder why because some in the american media
[1:04:11.980 --> 1:04:15.980]  are truly the enemy of the people and that's what it is that's why donald trump said that
[1:04:15.980 --> 1:04:17.900]  avoid that's extreme well it's the truth
[1:04:21.100 --> 1:04:28.300]  covet is just one example or covering up the manufacturing of covet in the bio weapons lab
[1:04:28.300 --> 1:04:33.820]  is just one level and once you understand how the media has covered that up or how they cover up
[1:04:34.940 --> 1:04:43.260]  all the crimes of the biden family or protect joe biden in his embarrassing whatever 130 days in
[1:04:43.260 --> 1:04:51.500]  office that has been so far his sloppy g7 putin summit that's why the media is the enemy of the
[1:04:51.500 --> 1:04:59.980]  people so you've got again just just i'll finish up on it now and get some of the other news because
[1:05:04.060 --> 1:05:08.780]  again this is something that you should be hearing from chris ray you should be hearing from the
[1:05:08.780 --> 1:05:17.580]  dia the cia the doj the white house you're not going to they're not on our team they are against
[1:05:17.580 --> 1:05:23.900]  us they are against we the people they are against america they they are just like the media they're
[1:05:23.900 --> 1:05:32.060]  connected at the hip it's a symbiote the corrupt media the corrupt politicians
[1:05:35.340 --> 1:05:42.780]  so again here are the headlines this is the latest from the uh from daily mail
[1:05:42.780 --> 1:05:50.540]  has a top chinese official defected to the u.s with wuhan lab secrets vice minister of state
[1:05:50.540 --> 1:05:56.140]  security fled beijing in february with information that sparked biden to u-turn on covid origins
[1:05:56.140 --> 1:06:02.780]  and so that's why you see that flip but of course it's just a cover up they know the information
[1:06:02.780 --> 1:06:07.900]  is inevitably going to get out but how do they control it and then steer the narrative in a way
[1:06:07.900 --> 1:06:15.420]  that protects their themselves and protects their chinese allies and so that's the real
[1:06:15.420 --> 1:06:20.700]  debate that's happening in dc right now in big tech right now that's why you see all the
[1:06:20.700 --> 1:06:25.500]  censorship of these stories that's why you saw the censorship of these stories a year ago when
[1:06:25.500 --> 1:06:32.380]  this was coming out that's why you had people kicked off of fox news for daring to report this
[1:06:32.380 --> 1:06:39.340]  for daring to report this stuff like fox business couple popular hosts just gone overnight
[1:06:40.060 --> 1:06:45.900]  who had the top ratings by the way trish reagan lou dobbs yeah they were a little suspicious of the
[1:06:45.900 --> 1:06:51.260]  covid leak out of the lab they were a little suspicious of all the shutdowns and well they
[1:06:51.260 --> 1:06:57.340]  talked about it on air and so they got they got the hammer banned by the way you have another
[1:06:57.340 --> 1:07:03.340]  fox news reporter at a local level going to project veritas to report corporate censorship but
[1:07:03.340 --> 1:07:09.740]  that's another story moving on so again high ranking chinese defector has direct knowledge
[1:07:09.740 --> 1:07:17.260]  of several chinese special weapons programs but not just that red states sources say that it's
[1:07:18.540 --> 1:07:24.940]  partially true i'm skipping ahead in this story here um about the u.s. intelligence
[1:07:24.940 --> 1:07:30.140]  agencies getting all of this information fbi director christopher ray was ambushed with the
[1:07:30.140 --> 1:07:37.260]  information and legally uh langley was unaware sources say dia leadership kept the defector
[1:07:37.260 --> 1:07:41.260]  within their clandestine services network to prevent langley and the state department from
[1:07:41.260 --> 1:07:46.780]  accessing the person whose existence was kept from other agencies because dia leadership believes
[1:07:46.780 --> 1:07:53.340]  there are chinese spies or sources inside the fbi cia and several other federal agencies
[1:07:53.340 --> 1:07:56.220]  so it's so bad
[1:08:00.060 --> 1:08:07.260]  in dc with chinese spies around every corner they don't even know what to do with this guy
[1:08:09.660 --> 1:08:15.980]  so it's kind of like epstein on a new level it's like okay here's epstein here's a triple agent
[1:08:15.980 --> 1:08:21.180]  quadruple agent whatever running industrial level sex trafficking stuff pedophile island the whole
[1:08:21.180 --> 1:08:27.900]  nine yards all this blackmail on on all these people used for control and capitulation and power
[1:08:29.420 --> 1:08:35.260]  and now you've got him going to jail and so it becomes an issue of wow how are we going to
[1:08:35.260 --> 1:08:43.820]  protect this guy and they couldn't so again it's a different level but it's the same thing
[1:08:43.820 --> 1:08:54.700]  how are they going to control this intelligence asset out of china and the two plus terabytes of
[1:08:54.700 --> 1:09:03.420]  data that he has on chinese bio weapons research including the covet lab and intelligence on us
[1:09:03.420 --> 1:09:11.980]  officials that are bought and paid for owned by the chinese communists as spies so again how do
[1:09:11.980 --> 1:09:18.460]  you control jeffrey epstein getting all that information out well you kill him in jail how do
[1:09:18.460 --> 1:09:23.100]  you control this chinese defector from getting all this information out how do you control
[1:09:23.820 --> 1:09:28.380]  those terabytes of information from getting into the public well they're running that scam
[1:09:28.380 --> 1:09:36.940]  right now they are answering those questions internally right now and to the good people
[1:09:36.940 --> 1:09:43.740]  that are actually in the cia or the dia or the white house or any of this stuff they're going
[1:09:43.740 --> 1:09:52.300]  to learn real quick how bad it is and you know that the biden administration and the fbi
[1:09:53.900 --> 1:09:58.460]  and others are going to do everything they can to keep this information from getting out and
[1:09:58.460 --> 1:10:03.420]  to keep this chinese defector from going fully public so that's the operation they're running
[1:10:03.420 --> 1:10:10.940]  right now so yeah they basically have this guy probably in jail the chikoms are begging them
[1:10:10.940 --> 1:10:16.780]  to be to send him back and they're hoarding and they're holding on to that intelligence so i mean
[1:10:16.780 --> 1:10:21.100]  they're literally keeping this guy from going public they're keeping the information from
[1:10:21.100 --> 1:10:25.580]  being public and they're keeping this defector from going public right now that's the biden
[1:10:25.580 --> 1:10:37.180]  administration that's the fbi they're covering up the origins of covet they're covering up a chinese
[1:10:38.540 --> 1:10:44.060]  military operation that was used against us and used against the world why because they're
[1:10:44.060 --> 1:10:51.420]  involved with it and so that's why zhijian ping laughs at biden because he owns him
[1:10:51.420 --> 1:10:59.020]  him joe biden is zhijian ping's bitch putin's bitch too apparently but for this it's more
[1:10:59.020 --> 1:11:06.700]  important because zhijian ping knows i china owns your corporations china owns your media
[1:11:06.700 --> 1:11:11.180]  and china owns your intelligence agencies what are you gonna do you're gonna come out
[1:11:12.300 --> 1:11:16.620]  and tell the world that we launched this bio weapon guess what we're gonna we're gonna tell the world
[1:11:16.620 --> 1:11:26.140]  who you are so zhijian ping the mafia gangster of the communist party in china now owns our
[1:11:26.140 --> 1:11:30.220]  intelligence agencies owns our major corporations owns our media
[1:11:32.780 --> 1:11:41.900]  owns biden and we get nothing we don't even have enough leadership in dc to blow this story
[1:11:41.900 --> 1:11:48.220]  wide open yesterday when we have the terabytes of information why aren't the chinese spies
[1:11:48.220 --> 1:11:55.500]  in the u.s government being arrested right now why you know it's crazy to get to this point
[1:11:55.500 --> 1:11:59.660]  it's very bittersweet everything we've talked about has happened just like we said it would
[1:12:00.220 --> 1:12:03.420]  and now we have a lot of credibility but i don't care about that i care about beating the new
[1:12:03.420 --> 1:12:08.220]  world border and it's because we have so much credibility they can't allow us to stay on air
[1:12:08.220 --> 1:12:12.540]  much longer and i don't have time to tell you all the stuff they're doing to us for a lot of reasons
[1:12:12.540 --> 1:12:16.940]  i can't tell you what's going on but let's just say this we're gonna see this through the end
[1:12:16.940 --> 1:12:22.140]  we're gonna stay on air as long as we can so please pray for us and please buy the products

[1:12:36.140 --> 1:12:40.860]  and looking for truth that's why the globalists are censoring they can't bring in all this tyranny

[1:14:29.340 --> 1:14:35.020]  from the global government tyranny being foisted upon us right now the medical tyranny
[1:14:36.620 --> 1:14:44.140]  the oppressive global communism that i mean you'll wish you had communism when this thing
[1:14:44.140 --> 1:14:50.140]  rolls out yeah communism uh-huh just another lie of the new world order
[1:14:52.780 --> 1:14:55.660]  well it's going to have to be us it's going to have to be you in the audience it's going
[1:14:55.660 --> 1:15:01.980]  to have to be leaders in politics leaders in business everything that's the only way we
[1:15:01.980 --> 1:15:07.340]  can get out of this ladies and gentlemen and so i'm going to finish up on this chinese defector
[1:15:07.340 --> 1:15:15.020]  story the best i can and it's frustrating because i can't possibly do this story justice i mean
[1:15:15.020 --> 1:15:24.300]  this is just it's just unbelievable i mean we have our our federal institutions and dc and the media
[1:15:25.500 --> 1:15:32.460]  are so corrupted and so against us that they're burying this story
[1:15:32.460 --> 1:15:42.140]  that not only we were lied to about covet in the outset but that
[1:15:44.300 --> 1:15:51.260]  it appears to be by design that this was a bio weapon and that the chinese military
[1:15:53.580 --> 1:16:01.100]  knew all about it and we're even running the program and that's just like again that's one level
[1:16:01.100 --> 1:16:06.860]  the chinese defector is also warning americans all of your top institutions are infiltrated by
[1:16:06.860 --> 1:16:11.500]  chinese spies and we know about swall well we know about feinstein we know about nancy plosie
[1:16:11.500 --> 1:16:18.300]  running cover i explained this earlier running cover for the chinese spies to get out of the us
[1:16:18.940 --> 1:16:22.460]  while covet was breaking out and donald trump was becoming privy to all of it
[1:16:23.100 --> 1:16:27.900]  so plosie goes down to china town and says oh no everything's great come down here nothing
[1:16:27.900 --> 1:16:33.020]  to be afraid of trump's racist don't ban travel from china so that all the chinese spies could
[1:16:33.020 --> 1:16:38.620]  get back to the chinese mainland safely and then they did and then of course just you know as as
[1:16:38.620 --> 1:16:43.340]  they would democrats came out now or for all the travel shut downs blaming trump for everything
[1:16:43.340 --> 1:16:46.620]  shut down the economy all of it after all the chinese spies got out
[1:16:49.980 --> 1:16:54.380]  and again this is a complex thing when dealing with covet
[1:16:54.380 --> 1:16:59.340]  because people will say well wait a second you say don't be afraid of covet we shouldn't
[1:16:59.340 --> 1:17:04.780]  shut down it's not a big deal but you're saying it's a bio weapon well yeah okay both can be true
[1:17:05.900 --> 1:17:09.580]  both are true we've been around long enough through this thing to know that but both of
[1:17:09.580 --> 1:17:15.580]  those things are the cases we actually have the real data on covet now and now we know how
[1:17:15.580 --> 1:17:22.700]  and where it came from and there's the mainstream media still there covering it up
[1:17:22.700 --> 1:17:28.940]  up and so they'll slow roll out the revelations that it came out of the luhan lab while they're
[1:17:28.940 --> 1:17:37.260]  covering it up that it was a military bio weapon and that western big tech companies were involved
[1:17:39.340 --> 1:17:47.260]  and that fauci and gates and obama were involved and that through this revelation that we're now
[1:17:47.260 --> 1:17:55.980]  learning about how the u.s. government is completely just just covered throughout with chinese spies
[1:17:58.940 --> 1:18:03.660]  and again you already know diane feinstein driven around by a chinese spy for two decades
[1:18:03.660 --> 1:18:10.140]  she knew she knew that eric swalwell sleeping with a chinese spy he probably didn't know that
[1:18:10.140 --> 1:18:21.260]  so what is going to happen to the chinese intelligence official don ging we that the
[1:18:22.060 --> 1:18:28.220]  federal government is currently basically keeping under wraps basically you know
[1:18:29.500 --> 1:18:33.020]  being put in jail i mean i don't think they have been in jail cell but you know they'll
[1:18:33.020 --> 1:18:37.900]  probably keep him in jail essentially so that he can't go public and other media won't cover this
[1:18:40.780 --> 1:18:44.860]  because they're all filled with chinese spies
[1:18:48.620 --> 1:18:58.220]  and you had the state run chinese media in 2018 promoting their labs take a look at the
[1:18:58.220 --> 1:19:03.740]  largest virus bank in asia wuhan institute of urology in central china's hubei province
[1:19:03.740 --> 1:19:10.860]  preserves more than 1500 different strains of viruses that came out in may of 18 from chinese
[1:19:10.860 --> 1:19:19.660]  run media china daily they've now deleted that tweet oh i wonder why and then now that again
[1:19:19.660 --> 1:19:24.620]  it's come out that this came out of the wuhan lab and it's pretty much just accepted without it being
[1:19:24.620 --> 1:19:32.220]  admitted the biden security advisor refuses to say how china will be punished for non cooperation
[1:19:32.220 --> 1:19:36.700]  with covid investigations so that's just what the investigations that were covered up not even
[1:19:36.700 --> 1:19:41.740]  with the manufacturing and release of the virus totally against the law against the everything
[1:19:41.740 --> 1:19:49.660]  janima convention nirenberg code all of it oh well the biden administration can't say how china
[1:19:49.660 --> 1:19:55.260]  will be punished because china won't be punished by the biden administration because china owns
[1:19:55.260 --> 1:19:59.500]  the biden administration the biden administration is china
[1:20:01.980 --> 1:20:06.620]  but see that's just another bubble waiting to burst in this deal
[1:20:08.700 --> 1:20:13.660]  and the more dramatic the effort is by the mainstream media and our politicians and our
[1:20:13.660 --> 1:20:19.980]  federal agencies to cover this up the more dramatic the revelations will be the more
[1:20:19.980 --> 1:20:26.380]  dramatic the responses will be from the american people when all this finally is revealed and
[1:20:26.380 --> 1:20:36.460]  understood and it is inevitable it's hard to say on a gauge where it's truly at right now
[1:20:37.180 --> 1:20:39.260]  simply because of all the censorship that happens
[1:20:39.260 --> 1:20:45.020]  and that we just don't even have a real media i mean info wars is as real as it gets in the
[1:20:45.020 --> 1:20:53.020]  media and i mean it's hard for us to really know i mean how many people understand the true origins
[1:20:53.020 --> 1:21:02.860]  the true story of covid-19 how many people really know about that and then how many people forget
[1:21:02.860 --> 1:21:09.260]  about the totally brainwashed leptis out there they they're their their soul is already merged with
[1:21:09.260 --> 1:21:14.780]  the death call so they don't that that's a non-entity but there's still good americans out there they
[1:21:14.780 --> 1:21:19.660]  just want to live their life and don't really know any of this is going on what happens when
[1:21:19.660 --> 1:21:25.820]  they realize this the people whose lives have been destroyed with their businesses getting
[1:21:25.820 --> 1:21:34.700]  shut down or families being torn apart suicides all of it are they going to be more mad at
[1:21:34.700 --> 1:21:38.540]  china for doing this or are they going to be more mad at the american media and our federal
[1:21:38.540 --> 1:21:48.060]  institutions that covered it all up and so that's why the biden administration the fbi the di and
[1:21:48.060 --> 1:21:53.180]  others are just in a panic behind the scenes right now because they're sitting on the they're
[1:21:53.180 --> 1:22:01.100]  sitting on basically an atom bomb that is going to blow them up and they don't know what to do with it
[1:22:03.340 --> 1:22:05.820]  because they'd like to blow it up but for nobody to see
[1:22:07.660 --> 1:22:12.780]  but how do you do that how do you blow up a how do you have a nuclear detonation without anybody
[1:22:12.780 --> 1:22:18.780]  noticing so that's the challenge that is upon the white house and chris ray and others right now
[1:22:18.780 --> 1:22:25.340]  now with this chinese defector being held right now who's given them all the intelligence
[1:22:25.340 --> 1:22:29.340]  that they already knew they already knew all the chinese spies were here they already knew it was
[1:22:29.340 --> 1:22:33.820]  a chinese bio weapon made by the military they already knew all that but now here's a here's a
[1:22:33.820 --> 1:22:38.060]  chinese defector saying hey you're gonna expose this right you're gonna do something about this
[1:22:38.060 --> 1:22:42.460]  right the chinese communists are evil they're launching bio warfare it's only gonna get worse
[1:22:42.460 --> 1:22:45.820]  and he hands it over and then chris ray and the biden administration kind of scratching the heads
[1:22:45.820 --> 1:22:50.380]  like uh okay yeah yeah we'll get this in the public sure just stay here for a minute yeah

[1:26:31.060 --> 1:26:40.820]  war room as well. So much to get to here. I'm going to move on now from this huge story.
[1:26:40.820 --> 1:26:43.940]  It's tough to because it's so big and no one else is making a big deal out of it.
[1:26:45.940 --> 1:26:50.020]  But we talked about it for about an hour plus now. So it's time to move on to some of the other
[1:26:50.020 --> 1:26:58.180]  stuff here. That the media won't tell you like the vaccines are hurting people and then just the
[1:26:58.180 --> 1:27:08.180]  complete now the Stockholm syndrome is just complete when it comes to what some of these
[1:27:08.180 --> 1:27:15.700]  leftists, some of these liberal progressive leftists are now willing to commit to where they'll have
[1:27:15.700 --> 1:27:22.100]  friends and family who die from the COVID vaccine and they'll put out the information on their
[1:27:22.100 --> 1:27:26.500]  social media accounts saying, yeah, my kid, my cousin, whatever died from it, but you should still
[1:27:26.500 --> 1:27:35.220]  get it. What? That is the completion of Stockholm syndrome right there.
[1:27:37.540 --> 1:27:42.980]  But I've got other big news here as well. And then what we witnessed from Juneteenth
[1:27:42.980 --> 1:27:50.180]  over the weekend, I think we're figuring out where this is going and really quickly as well
[1:27:50.180 --> 1:27:57.460]  with what happened over the weekend for Juneteenth, quote, unquote, celebrations,
[1:27:58.260 --> 1:28:05.220]  celebrations is, I suppose, what we're going to be calling those. So we'll have all of that
[1:28:05.220 --> 1:28:10.100]  coming up. I'm going to get to some news clips now. But first, remember, folks, infowarstore.com.

[1:29:15.620 --> 1:29:25.300]  Okay, let's take a look at what happened over the weekend during quote unquote,
[1:29:25.300 --> 1:29:35.220]  Juneteenth celebrations. And so Juneteenth, which I don't know, maybe Trump saw this coming. Trump
[1:29:35.220 --> 1:29:41.700]  wanted to make Juneteenth a federal holiday and make it a thing that American patriots could own
[1:29:41.700 --> 1:29:46.420]  and that we could be proud of. And we could say this is when America ended slavery. This is when
[1:29:46.420 --> 1:29:52.420]  we set an example for the world to stop having slavery. It's not a good thing. And so America
[1:29:52.420 --> 1:29:57.620]  set that standard and we freed our slaves and we fought a battle over it and we came out of that.
[1:30:00.500 --> 1:30:05.140]  But they want to turn it into something negative. Oh, America's racist. Oh, America's all about
[1:30:05.140 --> 1:30:15.300]  slavery to then turn it into some weird, like purge style thing where because of Juneteenth,
[1:30:15.300 --> 1:30:20.260]  you can just go out and riot and loot and do all the stuff again. Like, oh, it's, oh, George
[1:30:20.260 --> 1:30:25.220]  Floyd, I'm rioting and looting. Oh, okay. Oh, Breonna Taylor, I'm rioting and looting. Oh, Mike
[1:30:25.220 --> 1:30:31.140]  Brown, I'm rioting and looting. Oh, Juneteenth, I'm rioting and looting. So it could have been a
[1:30:31.140 --> 1:30:35.300]  good thing. It could have been a good thing for America, another thing for us to wave the flag
[1:30:35.300 --> 1:30:40.740]  and be proud of what we've done here. Not proud that we had a sordid history at times, but proud
[1:30:40.740 --> 1:30:45.140]  that we came out of it, proud that we learned, proud that we became better, proud that we set
[1:30:45.140 --> 1:30:52.020]  a standard again for the globe. No, now it's been weaponized and it becomes a new, I'm rioting,
[1:30:52.020 --> 1:30:57.460]  I'm looting because of George Floyd. And yeah, you've got George Floyd statues going up coast
[1:30:57.460 --> 1:31:04.100]  to coast. It's just, it's, it's insane. So they tear down Thomas Jefferson or Columbus and then
[1:31:04.100 --> 1:31:13.140]  replace it with George Floyd, a career criminal who once held a loaded weapon to a pregnant woman
[1:31:13.140 --> 1:31:20.020]  because he was robbing her. And now he's a hero. Amazing how that works. But so let's take a look.
[1:31:20.020 --> 1:31:24.980]  Yeah, this is just some of the B roll. That's what George Floyd would look like. He was white.
[1:31:24.980 --> 1:31:29.540]  Yeah, they have white statues of George Floyd too. I mean, that's how insane this is. But let's go
[1:31:29.540 --> 1:31:36.420]  to clip one. This is in Oakland. Just some of the scenes guys just roll the B roll from clip one.
[1:31:36.420 --> 1:31:44.740]  This is just the scenes in Oakland where Juneteenth was and you had one dead and five injured in
[1:31:44.740 --> 1:31:50.900]  mass shootings at Juneteenth. And then the EMTs arrived and look at what happened. So here,
[1:31:50.900 --> 1:31:54.900]  let's roll this from the top with audio. I think it's okay. I think I'm pretty sure it's censored.
[1:31:54.900 --> 1:32:01.620]  So here you go. So you had a mass shooting in Oakland at a Juneteenth event. And when the EMTs
[1:32:01.620 --> 1:32:07.060]  arrived to treat the people that just got shot, look what the people that were attending the
[1:32:07.060 --> 1:32:17.140]  Juneteenth quote unquote celebration did. Check this out. So as the EMTs are unloading
[1:32:18.100 --> 1:32:26.260]  journeys and getting medical instruments, the Juneteenth celebrators, whatever you want to call
[1:32:26.260 --> 1:32:36.420]  them, take over the EMT ambulance and turn it into a Cardi B WAP video with their asses hanging
[1:32:36.420 --> 1:32:40.980]  out, their breasts hanging out, they're grinding on one another, they're climbing on top of the
[1:32:40.980 --> 1:32:50.020]  ambulance and they're cheering it all on. And it's just a big joke. Yeah, people got shot here
[1:32:50.020 --> 1:32:53.700]  and the ambulance is here to help them. So let's just dance on the car and let's work on it. Let's
[1:32:53.700 --> 1:33:02.180]  turn this into a Cardi B WAP video. Juneteenth, man, you know, because Juneteenth. So is this
[1:33:02.180 --> 1:33:06.420]  what we're going to see on Juneteenth every year now? Is this the new regular thing for Juneteenth?
[1:33:06.420 --> 1:33:12.020]  Is it going to be now? Businesses are going to board up their windows and doors and shut down
[1:33:12.020 --> 1:33:18.580]  on Juneteenth because it's going to become an insane spectacle of criminal and debauchery activity.
[1:33:18.580 --> 1:33:29.140]  So there you go. Here's another one here in clip four, guys, roll clip four, another Juneteenth
[1:33:29.140 --> 1:33:34.980]  celebration that resulted in four being shot. So, you know, so there you go. So there's another
[1:33:34.980 --> 1:33:42.740]  one. Here's another Juneteenth celebration for people shot. And of course, that didn't stop the
[1:33:42.740 --> 1:33:49.380]  ongoingers from having their party and continuing to party in the streets, you know, because of
[1:33:49.380 --> 1:33:55.620]  Juneteenth, you see. And then you have this was in Chicago. I'll tell you, there was something
[1:33:55.620 --> 1:34:01.700]  even more disgusting perhaps than the event itself. Guys, just roll the b-roll clip five in Chicago
[1:34:01.700 --> 1:34:10.100]  over the weekend. A father and his wife, who have one child together, were pulled out of their vehicle
[1:34:10.100 --> 1:34:16.500]  in Chicago and shot executed at point blank range. The father is now dead. The wife is in critical
[1:34:16.500 --> 1:34:25.460]  condition. Just regular day in Chicago. Now, there's multiple homicides every day. At the end
[1:34:25.460 --> 1:34:29.700]  of the year, it's going to be an average about three homicides a day. And then now is the media
[1:34:29.700 --> 1:34:35.300]  going to show you this footage of this guy dying after being executed on the streets of Chicago,
[1:34:35.300 --> 1:34:41.700]  pulled from his vehicle and executed as he's trying to protect his girlfriend. By the way,
[1:34:41.700 --> 1:34:46.020]  what is what is the one thread that all these videos have in common? It's all white supremacist,
[1:34:46.020 --> 1:34:51.620]  isn't it? This is a bunch of white supremacist activity, isn't it? Are they going to show you
[1:34:51.620 --> 1:34:57.620]  this individual dying on the streets of Chicago being murdered by a bunch of white supremacist
[1:34:57.620 --> 1:35:01.780]  thugs? Oh, that's right. Why supremacist here is codeword for black people, I guess.
[1:35:01.780 --> 1:35:05.700]  We're on where in the media, white supremacist is code for Trump supporter. So I guess we all
[1:35:05.700 --> 1:35:12.020]  have coded verb, verbology now. No, let's call it what it is. Black thugs murdered a guy in Chicago.
[1:35:12.020 --> 1:35:17.940]  Black thugs celebrating Juneteenth around this country, multiple shootings, dancing on EMT cars,
[1:35:17.940 --> 1:35:22.500]  and they say white supremacists are the biggest threat. Here's what's even more disgusting though
[1:35:22.500 --> 1:35:27.540]  about that individual. Leftists are going on Twitter commenting on people posting that video
[1:35:27.540 --> 1:35:32.500]  defending the murderer. I'm not kidding you. Defending the murderer saying, oh,
[1:35:32.500 --> 1:35:36.420]  whitey in the car must have deserved it. The guy was from Puerto Rico saying, hey,
[1:35:36.420 --> 1:35:42.500]  he had a Confederate flag. He deserved it. It was a Puerto Rican flag. So that's how brainwash
[1:35:42.500 --> 1:35:48.500]  leftists are now is they defend criminals that are black and they say that it's the victim's fault.
[1:35:48.500 --> 1:35:53.300]  I mean, this is unbelievable. This is who they are. I started taking high end fish oil and high
[1:35:53.300 --> 1:35:58.020]  end krill oil more than a decade ago because the scientific literature is overwhelming. It's good
[1:35:58.020 --> 1:36:02.580]  for your heart, your brain, your whole body, your well being. A lot of folks take it before
[1:36:02.580 --> 1:36:07.460]  they take tests. People that have arthritis pain, they take it. It's well known for the things it
[1:36:07.460 --> 1:36:13.460]  does for a body. It makes our lives so much better. Then I learned about high grade fish oil
[1:36:13.460 --> 1:36:18.260]  and high grade krill oil. We've got both at FullWareStore.com. But with the COVID lockdown,
[1:36:18.260 --> 1:36:22.340]  supply chains are broken down. So it's been months and months and months since we've had krill oil
[1:36:22.340 --> 1:36:26.420]  back in stock. Well, let's back, ladies and gentlemen. And despite the fact that it's already
[1:36:26.420 --> 1:36:32.580]  very fairly priced for the grade it is, highest quality, we're offering it at 40% off for a limited
[1:36:32.580 --> 1:36:38.100]  time at infowarstore.com with free shipping and double-patriot points. Because I want those of
[1:36:38.100 --> 1:36:41.140]  you that have already been customers to have a chance to get more of it. And I want new viewers
[1:36:41.140 --> 1:36:46.420]  and listeners who haven't tried it to get it from us and then try regular krill oil that is not one
[1:36:46.420 --> 1:36:53.140]  tenth as powerful as ours. This is the highest grade back in stock at FullWareStore.com.
[1:36:55.300 --> 1:36:59.060]  Granny Do Right. Granny Do Right. Thanks for holding her on the air. Go ahead.
[1:36:59.060 --> 1:37:05.060]  Yeah, and first of all, let me say I love your products. I am a granny and for all the senior
[1:37:05.060 --> 1:37:10.340]  citizens out there that may have spent a lifetime in the sun like me, I was loaded up with sunspots
[1:37:10.340 --> 1:37:15.940]  or age spots as they're lovingly called. But since taking your X2 for the last couple of years,
[1:37:15.940 --> 1:37:23.380]  my skin is just really gorgeous, actually. People think I'm 55 years old. And I was already taking
[1:37:23.380 --> 1:37:27.860]  your other supplements, but I thought, you know, well, maybe that's what I need to do because I
[1:37:27.860 --> 1:37:32.180]  just thought it was a hopeless situation. But when I started taking it, I mean, it doesn't happen
[1:37:32.180 --> 1:37:38.180]  immediately. But, you know, over a period of time, I started noticing, okay, you know, this is a
[1:37:38.180 --> 1:37:43.140]  ticket. This is working. This is wonderful. You know, I don't, I don't have to put it on
[1:37:43.140 --> 1:37:49.620]  derma blend anymore, you know. So anyway, it worked wonderfully and it really has totally cleared up my skin.
[1:37:53.620 --> 1:37:57.380]  The entire new world order system is about making you feel pathetic,
[1:37:57.940 --> 1:38:03.220]  making you feel weak, making you play the part of a victim. So you don't take your birthright
[1:38:03.220 --> 1:38:08.500]  as being made the image of God and the incredible mission and destiny we have being given free will
[1:38:08.500 --> 1:38:15.300]  being given free will being given consciousness is literally the seed of an entire universe,
[1:38:15.300 --> 1:38:20.420]  an entire system. And the fact that you're able to commune with God, the fact you're able to see
[1:38:20.420 --> 1:38:25.140]  the beauty of the sunset, or the beauty of the waves in the ocean, or the beauty of your life,
[1:38:25.140 --> 1:38:30.180]  your husband, the beauty of your child learning knowledge, the beauty of music, the fact that
[1:38:30.180 --> 1:38:36.660]  you can commune with that and resonate with that is energetic. And that itself is what God teaches
[1:38:36.660 --> 1:38:41.780]  us is worship. So don't worship the globalist, don't worship the NFL, don't worship all the
[1:38:41.780 --> 1:38:47.140]  things in the system, but worship the things of God because we're made by God and appreciate your
[1:38:47.140 --> 1:38:51.540]  consciousness and appreciate free speech while you still have it, while you still have it.
[1:38:52.820 --> 1:38:59.700]  Scientists agree magnesium is the most important co-factor in the body, regulating and controlling
[1:38:59.700 --> 1:39:06.020]  hundreds of pathways. Magnesium is required for your body to do the following, helps convert
[1:39:06.020 --> 1:39:12.180]  food into energy, helps with muscle contraction function, helps regulate the nervous system,
[1:39:12.180 --> 1:39:18.020]  helps with protein building in the muscles, and so much more. And now it's available in this
[1:39:18.020 --> 1:39:24.740]  concentrated form of ionized, fizzy, magnesium. It tastes great. I take it in the morning, I take
[1:39:24.740 --> 1:39:30.580]  it in the evening. It is so essential in my life. And I hope all of you will check it out and try

[1:40:14.900 --> 1:40:22.180]  So the left is all about division. And the agenda of the globalist is to divide America so that it
[1:40:22.180 --> 1:40:26.580]  can be conquered. So it's all this race baiting. It's all this identity politics. It's all garbage.
[1:40:27.380 --> 1:40:30.100]  The average American doesn't care what color your skin color is.
[1:40:31.860 --> 1:40:36.740]  What color your skin is. It's redundant there. They don't care about your upbringing, your class.
[1:40:36.740 --> 1:40:40.180]  Most people, it's only leftists that really do. They're the ones that seem to be obsessed with
[1:40:40.180 --> 1:40:48.580]  race and class and all this stuff. But see, it then becomes this issue of how do I even cover
[1:40:48.580 --> 1:40:55.940]  what's happening without adding to the problem? Because there's obviously emotional levels involved
[1:40:55.940 --> 1:41:02.180]  here when whether you're black or white, you know, you're getting pulled emotionally
[1:41:04.100 --> 1:41:08.420]  on your heartstrings here by all the propaganda. So it's like here comes the FBI and all this
[1:41:08.420 --> 1:41:12.980]  mainstream media crap where if you're white, you're the problem in the education system
[1:41:12.980 --> 1:41:17.940]  everywhere. You're white, you're bad. You're white, you're the problem. You must be eliminated.
[1:41:17.940 --> 1:41:25.220]  You must be disseminated. Your days are over. And so the white person is like, what are you talking
[1:41:25.220 --> 1:41:34.580]  about? And then if you're a black person, the propaganda targets you saying you're a victim.
[1:41:34.580 --> 1:41:41.300]  You've been wronged. It's the white person's fault. And so you don't want to buy into any of it.
[1:41:42.180 --> 1:41:50.660]  But see, it's my duty here to this audience that tunes in to tell you the truth about what's going
[1:41:50.660 --> 1:41:56.420]  on. And so when all of our media and our federal government is telling you that white supremacy
[1:41:56.420 --> 1:42:02.820]  is the problem, but you look at inner inner inner city run by Democrats with a majority black
[1:42:02.820 --> 1:42:08.500]  population, it's the most violent criminal areas that you can live in. And then you have a Juneteenth
[1:42:08.500 --> 1:42:14.900]  celebration over the weekend in multiple cities where there's mass shootings, people dancing on
[1:42:14.900 --> 1:42:20.900]  EMT ambulances when they arrive to stop the bleeding out of people that had just been shot.
[1:42:22.020 --> 1:42:27.140]  And then in this clip two and clip eight, just breaking out into fights. This is in New Jersey.
[1:42:27.140 --> 1:42:32.340]  So like I said, just roll clip eight, just roll the B roll. So like I said, literally from coast
[1:42:32.340 --> 1:42:41.380]  to coast, Juneteenth weekend became an exhibition in total thuggery. But see, that's what that's
[1:42:41.380 --> 1:42:47.780]  what it's all about. So oh, I'm black. I'm a victim. So I get this day like a purge style event
[1:42:48.980 --> 1:42:56.260]  to behave in a debauchery criminal manner. And so this is what the media does. Oh, George Floyd
[1:42:56.260 --> 1:43:01.700]  died. Go out and loot and riot. Oh, Mike Brown died. Go out and loot and riot. And they lie about
[1:43:01.700 --> 1:43:10.340]  how they died. And then cities are decimated by this massive crime wave. And then the white person
[1:43:10.340 --> 1:43:15.300]  and then the white man is blamed, even though whether you want to watch the videos of all
[1:43:15.300 --> 1:43:21.220]  this going on or look at the FBI crime statistics, it's not white men. No, it's not.
[1:43:23.380 --> 1:43:27.940]  But they're the ones that are told they need to be blamed. They're the ones that are told their
[1:43:27.940 --> 1:43:36.020]  bad. And so again, how do you even cover that without becoming part of the problem?
[1:43:39.140 --> 1:43:47.380]  How how do you fix an issue where as long as people are still buying into the mainstream
[1:43:47.380 --> 1:43:52.740]  media propaganda, it's never going to be fixed, whether that's to hate a white person or hate
[1:43:52.740 --> 1:44:00.100]  police or whatever it else is. So again, I could sit here and roll this footage for you all day
[1:44:00.100 --> 1:44:06.020]  long. And you'll notice there's something in common with all this criminal activity. I mean,
[1:44:06.020 --> 1:44:13.060]  I'm not the one obsessed with race. But if you're observant and honest and you want to talk about
[1:44:13.060 --> 1:44:19.940]  race, we'll go ahead and have that conversation. The left won't have it. And of course they won't
[1:44:19.940 --> 1:44:29.140]  because it's every Democrat city. Look at these numbers. Crime surges in cities across the country,
[1:44:29.140 --> 1:44:36.500]  every single one run by Democrats, Atlanta up 58% and homicides from a year ago, 40% up in
[1:44:36.500 --> 1:44:46.900]  shootings, New York City 13% up in homicide, 64% in shootings, Portland, 533% increase in homicides,
[1:44:46.900 --> 1:44:53.780]  126% increase in shootings, Chicago up 5% in homicides up 18% in shootings.
[1:44:54.980 --> 1:44:59.620]  That number is actually wrong. I don't know why. So now I'm wondering, I know for a fact,
[1:44:59.620 --> 1:45:07.540]  Chicago is up more than 5%. I've done I've run those numbers myself. Chicago is up 50%.
[1:45:09.700 --> 1:45:14.020]  Chicago is on pace to double actually. So so would that be 100% then?
[1:45:14.020 --> 1:45:18.900]  So that number is actually wrong. You can go look at the homicides in Chicago.
[1:45:19.860 --> 1:45:24.740]  There have been over 300 homicides in Chicago so far this year. There were 290
[1:45:25.540 --> 1:45:32.180]  in Chicago last year. So that number is actually inaccurate. Los Angeles up 22% in homicides,
[1:45:32.180 --> 1:45:38.580]  51% shootings. Philadelphia up 37% homicides, 27% in shootings. And if the number in Chicago is low,
[1:45:38.580 --> 1:45:44.580]  I'm wondering if the rest of them aren't low. Those are just numbers from Fox. But see,
[1:45:46.420 --> 1:45:53.860]  this is what's happening now inside of law enforcement. You know, and this is such a critical
[1:45:53.860 --> 1:45:59.700]  thing. You should do like a whole hour just breaking this down and discussing it. But
[1:45:59.700 --> 1:46:07.540]  the story in the LAist, and this story is elsewhere too, but this was the source I was
[1:46:07.540 --> 1:46:13.460]  researching mostly. Here are the people Los Angeles's district attorney who is funded by
[1:46:13.460 --> 1:46:20.340]  Soros. That's George Gaston. Here are the people Los Angeles's district attorney, which is
[1:46:21.220 --> 1:46:27.780]  really Soros's district attorney, has named to review past police shootings. So get this, police
[1:46:27.780 --> 1:46:33.460]  shootings in Los Angeles that have already gone through the system of review and court and all of
[1:46:33.460 --> 1:46:38.580]  it, are now going to go back through the system. Now that would be illegal. That's like double
[1:46:38.580 --> 1:46:44.980]  jeopardy. You can't do that. Oh, but see, they found an end around. And so now this Soros paid for,
[1:46:44.980 --> 1:47:01.140]  Soros bought and paid for DA, George Gaston, has hired a group of Black Lives Matter protesters to
[1:47:01.140 --> 1:47:08.100]  review past police shootings. And if they find any proprieties in those rulings, there will be
[1:47:08.100 --> 1:47:15.220]  an end to this. This is brought up. You can go back 10 years, 20 years. They don't care. They're
[1:47:15.220 --> 1:47:24.660]  going to find you. So this is giving the anti-cop Soros run left wing a knife to hold to the cop's
[1:47:24.660 --> 1:47:29.460]  throat politically. Do you think there's going to be fairness? Do you think there's going to be
[1:47:29.460 --> 1:47:37.460]  neutrality in those decisions? And see, if you understand this, you understand what happens
[1:47:37.460 --> 1:47:49.540]  is they'll hire all of their brainwashed, propagandized minions and goons to select committees
[1:47:49.540 --> 1:47:56.580]  and boards that are above law to then say, yes, these people committed crimes. Yes, these police
[1:47:56.580 --> 1:48:01.540]  committed crimes. Yes, they committed an insurrection. And then whatever law enforcement
[1:48:01.540 --> 1:48:05.540]  agencies will say, see, these are just neutral committees. You know, these are just neutral
[1:48:05.540 --> 1:48:09.540]  committees and we find their decisions to be neutral. So we're going after the people that
[1:48:09.540 --> 1:48:13.220]  they said are the criminals here. We're going after those cops. We're going after those
[1:48:13.220 --> 1:48:21.220]  Trump supporters. This is what they're doing right now. And that's why you have people like
[1:48:21.220 --> 1:48:28.420]  Frank Figluzzi, Frank Figluzzi, celebrating stories from the Washington Post saying that
[1:48:28.420 --> 1:48:32.660]  the federal government wants to arrest Alex Jones. And the funny thing is in the Washington Post
[1:48:32.660 --> 1:48:37.940]  story, it even says it has to admit that Alex Jones was calling for peace that entire day,
[1:48:39.380 --> 1:48:44.820]  which they lied about in their first publication. But then we sent them all the videos of us
[1:48:44.820 --> 1:48:50.260]  saying, don't go in, it's time to be peaceful. Don't go in, be peaceful. And they had to retract
[1:48:50.260 --> 1:48:56.180]  and rewrite their story. But they didn't change the headlines. And that didn't stop Frank Figluzzi,
[1:48:56.180 --> 1:49:00.580]  the FBI official that wants to arrest all Trump supporters from celebrating the fact
[1:49:00.580 --> 1:49:03.380]  that the federal government is being aimed at Americans. He loves it.
[1:49:06.260 --> 1:49:11.700]  So that's what they'll do. And he has a new podcast now. So they'll put
[1:49:12.900 --> 1:49:23.700]  their ideologues on unofficial committees and boards that will act as some sort of surrogate
[1:49:23.700 --> 1:49:28.900]  for actual law enforcement, but has not been defunded. So there's no real local law enforcement.
[1:49:28.900 --> 1:49:35.620]  That's all been defunded. They have these left wing, Soros-backed committees and boards that
[1:49:35.620 --> 1:49:42.100]  will then be making decisions like some sort of a courtroom jury. And then if they decide you're
[1:49:42.100 --> 1:49:46.660]  a racist or you're a bigot or you're this or that, oh, and then they'll send their actual
[1:49:46.660 --> 1:49:53.300]  compromised law enforcement to come scoop you up, which will be nothing but leftist at that time,
[1:49:53.300 --> 1:50:03.220]  because anybody that doesn't want to be a tyrannical corrupt political enforcer of the Democrat
[1:50:03.220 --> 1:50:09.540]  Party like in Portland will quit. So that's why you're seeing all the special forces and police
[1:50:09.540 --> 1:50:18.260]  quit that are like, you know, raid people and riot squads and rapid response squads because
[1:50:18.260 --> 1:50:23.460]  they know like in Portland, oh, okay, they went, hey, a group of people are burning down a building
[1:50:23.460 --> 1:50:30.660]  with people inside. So the rapid response team shows up. One of them happens to barely
[1:50:30.660 --> 1:50:36.420]  breeze a journalist who's like flopping and flailing and then he gets sued and he gets
[1:50:36.420 --> 1:50:40.420]  arrested. Not the people that burn the building down, but the police that showed up to stop it.
[1:50:42.020 --> 1:50:46.980]  Info wars is here because there's a war on for your mind. That's why I spent our motto for more
[1:50:46.980 --> 1:50:53.220]  than 25 years. And if you research even the UN's own admissions over 2 billion people on planet
[1:50:53.220 --> 1:50:59.620]  earth out of 7.5 billion have cognitive disabilities lower IQ because of lack of iodine. That's why
[1:50:59.620 --> 1:51:04.580]  they work to make sure iodine isn't in the food isn't in the salt anymore. Now, regular iodine
[1:51:04.580 --> 1:51:10.740]  that you find in food is bound to different minerals. And so it's hard for your body to absorb.
[1:51:10.740 --> 1:51:14.660]  But if you get the proper type of iodine, there's three types that are good for the body.
[1:51:14.660 --> 1:51:19.940]  It does amazing things. It's essential in the body. But we have our amazing tri iodine,
[1:51:19.940 --> 1:51:25.300]  a big shipment came in and so we're able to offer it at the lowest price ever 60% off. That is

[1:52:41.380 --> 1:52:41.940] .com
[1:52:44.980 --> 1:52:48.740]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[1:52:48.740 --> 1:53:11.540]  Oh, that's a shame that old flu fighter song that was all about fighting the establishment.
[1:53:11.540 --> 1:53:15.380]  Turns out that Dave Groll that wrote it is nothing but an establishment hack
[1:53:15.380 --> 1:53:22.100]  doing concerts for only vaccinated people. So he ends up being the pretender in the long run.
[1:53:24.340 --> 1:53:29.060]  I want to play a couple videos showing you how racist the Democrats actually are. I know it's
[1:53:29.060 --> 1:53:33.860]  not that hard to find, but the media won't cover it. Just go back to the founding of the Democrat
[1:53:33.860 --> 1:53:40.020]  Party. The former KKK members that took their hoods off and then declared themselves Democrats.
[1:53:40.020 --> 1:53:46.420]  Yes, that's how it was founded. And still to this day, they execute their racism across this
[1:53:46.420 --> 1:53:53.380]  country, even maybe even worse nowadays because it's nationwide and in the White House. But
[1:53:54.020 --> 1:54:01.700]  here is Democrat Senator Sheldon White House who belongs to an all white club in Rhode Island.
[1:54:01.700 --> 1:54:08.340]  Now, I can't believe these things still exist. But you know where they exist? In Democrat,
[1:54:08.340 --> 1:54:14.260]  liberal elite areas, they still have whites only clubs. I'm not kidding you. They have
[1:54:14.260 --> 1:54:20.340]  whites only clubs and Democrats are members at them. And so Sheldon White House was questioned
[1:54:20.340 --> 1:54:27.460]  about his membership there while pretending to fight racism and his response is classic.
[1:54:29.220 --> 1:54:34.100]  Okay, back in 2017, you had expressed concerns about the membership of the all white Bailey
[1:54:34.100 --> 1:54:38.420]  speech club said that you hoped it would become more diverse. Now your family's been members,
[1:54:38.420 --> 1:54:42.660]  your wife is one of the largest shareholders. Has there been any traction in that? Are there
[1:54:42.660 --> 1:54:47.140]  any minority members of the club now? I think the people who are running the place are still
[1:54:47.140 --> 1:54:51.620]  working on that. And I'm sorry it hasn't happened yet. Do you have concerns in 2021? I mean,
[1:54:51.620 --> 1:54:55.780]  obviously it's been four years. You had remarks on the floor, following the deaths of Breonna
[1:54:55.780 --> 1:55:00.820]  Taylor and George Floyd saying, you know, hoping to root out systemic racism in the country.
[1:55:00.820 --> 1:55:07.940]  Um, your thoughts on an elite, all white, wealthy club again in this day and age. Um,
[1:55:07.940 --> 1:55:13.220]  you know, should these clubs continue to exist? It's a long tradition in Rhode Island and there
[1:55:13.220 --> 1:55:19.700]  are many of them. Oh, we just need to work our way through the issues. Thank you. It doesn't
[1:55:19.700 --> 1:55:24.580]  want to talk anymore. He gets whisked away by this security. Mr. Richardson, your wife is one
[1:55:24.580 --> 1:55:29.860]  of the main decision makers at an all white country club in Rhode Island that you've been
[1:55:29.860 --> 1:55:34.580]  member of for decades. Uh, what do you think about that bigotry? Well, it's a tradition here.
[1:55:35.940 --> 1:55:42.660]  That's his excuse. It's a tradition. Oh my God. Yeah. It's a tradition in the Democrat party
[1:55:42.660 --> 1:55:49.380]  to be racist and openly segregationists now as well. So, uh, that's the racism of the Democrat
[1:55:49.380 --> 1:55:53.940]  party showing there. Hey, it's a long tradition. He's right. It's a long tradition of Democrats
[1:55:53.940 --> 1:56:00.820]  to be racist. Oh man. Don't expect the media to call him out for that. Can you believe that a
[1:56:00.820 --> 1:56:05.620]  Democrat is a member at an all white country club and says, well, it's a tradition and says,
[1:56:05.620 --> 1:56:09.300]  well, the people in charge may want to change it. His wife basically runs the place. It's just
[1:56:09.300 --> 1:56:16.020]  hilarious stuff. Now here's Joe Biden on a zoom call on Juneteenth with all black people, by the
[1:56:16.020 --> 1:56:22.500]  way. Listen to this. This is stunning. Listen to this quote from Joe Biden on a zoom call for
[1:56:22.500 --> 1:56:37.140]  Juneteenth with all black people. Clip three clip three guys. This country is doomed. It is doomed
[1:56:37.140 --> 1:56:46.660]  not just because of African Americans, but because by 2040, this country is going to be minority
[1:56:46.660 --> 1:56:52.660]  white European. Hear me? And that makes us doomed. European. And now we're doomed. You guys are
[1:56:52.660 --> 1:56:57.380]  going to have to start working more with Hispanics who'll make up a lot of your guys. What does he
[1:56:57.380 --> 1:57:09.060]  mean by that? Y'all do. Y'all. Now folks, what in the world does that mean? Wow. So, Sheldon White
[1:57:09.060 --> 1:57:15.860]  House, prominent Democrat belongs to White's only country clubs that his wife runs and then
[1:57:15.860 --> 1:57:21.540]  Biden on a zoom call with all black people for Juneteenth says that America's doomed because
[1:57:21.540 --> 1:57:28.740]  it's too many black people. You can't make this stuff up. And then even does the whole you people
[1:57:28.740 --> 1:57:36.180]  thing live on the zoom call. So according to Biden, America is doomed because the white race
[1:57:36.180 --> 1:57:44.100]  is becoming a minority. Biden's words, not mine. Happy Juneteenth America. Your president is a
[1:57:44.100 --> 1:57:53.860]  racist. People pat me on the back all the time. And I really, really appreciate it. But I want you
[1:57:53.860 --> 1:58:00.340]  to understand something. Don't put the horse in front of the cart here. Don't put the wagon in front
[1:58:00.340 --> 1:58:04.820]  of the mules here. If you weren't supporting us, if you weren't praying for us, if you weren't

[1:58:49.540 --> 1:59:06.340]  All right, we're in the third hour of the Alex Jones show. Now Gerald Salente going to be hosting
[1:59:06.340 --> 1:59:11.140]  the fourth hour. I'll be back hosting the war room three to 6pm. And so I want to let you know
[1:59:12.500 --> 1:59:17.460]  that I'm going to take calls on the war room today. I do have some other news stories that I'm
[1:59:17.460 --> 1:59:22.900]  holding over to cover exclusively on the war room. But I believe we're guest free today.
[1:59:22.900 --> 1:59:28.340]  And so that means I can take calls for at least two hours probably on the war room today. So if
[1:59:28.340 --> 1:59:34.260]  you're chomping at the bit to get through to info wars today, the war room will be the time. What
[1:59:34.260 --> 1:59:38.980]  does that hold on the crew has something? What was that guys? Oh, okay, that's right. We've got
[1:59:38.980 --> 1:59:45.220]  Oh, yes, we've got new war bin Laden joining me on the war room today to discuss what happened to her
[1:59:45.220 --> 1:59:55.460]  in Switzerland last week with Dan Lyman when she held up a Trump one banner flag on a lake in
[1:59:55.460 --> 2:00:00.580]  Switzerland outside of the Putin Biden summit and the police and the military showed up and
[2:00:00.580 --> 2:00:07.700]  threatened to arrest her. So she'll be giving us her first hand account of that that happened to her.
[2:00:07.700 --> 2:00:11.060]  But other than that were wide open. So we'll be taking calls on the war room probably right out
[2:00:11.060 --> 2:00:17.300]  of the gates even. But I've got this other news I want to get to here in the meantime. Now,
[2:00:19.860 --> 2:00:28.020]  this is this is truly a freaky phenomenon here. And it's it's really scary to see this from
[2:00:28.020 --> 2:00:36.900]  your fellow humans. I mean, imagine if this is graphic, but this is a real illustration. Imagine
[2:00:36.900 --> 2:00:41.940]  if you're, you know, walking down the street in your neighborhood, and there's a line of people.
[2:00:43.140 --> 2:00:49.060]  And you just you don't know what's going on. And you say, what is this line of people doing out here
[2:00:49.060 --> 2:00:56.180]  today? Someone says, Well, this is the woodchipper line. Woodchipper line, I'm sorry, I don't
[2:00:56.180 --> 2:01:01.460]  understand. So yeah, there's people lined up to jump in the woodchipper. Say what? So yeah,
[2:01:01.460 --> 2:01:05.460]  these people are lining up to jump into a woodchipper. Okay, this is insane. I don't believe
[2:01:05.460 --> 2:01:10.740]  you. And so you walk to the front line and sure enough, they're just hopping in just jump in who's
[2:01:10.740 --> 2:01:19.300]  naturally chopped up into into pink mist. And you're like, what the hell? That'd be pretty
[2:01:19.300 --> 2:01:24.180]  shocking. That'd be stunning. That'd be something that changes you. Well, that's basically what's
[2:01:24.180 --> 2:01:30.180]  going on with this COVID vaccine. Yeah, it's not bloody people getting chopped up in woodchippers.
[2:01:30.180 --> 2:01:41.860]  But when you have people that celebrate when you have people that celebrate the COVID vaccine
[2:01:41.860 --> 2:01:47.380]  side effects and saying, Yeah, my my friends, my family died from the COVID vaccine.
[2:01:49.140 --> 2:01:55.540]  But I think you should get it anyway. Again, that that's like watching people hop into a woodchipper.
[2:01:55.540 --> 2:02:02.580]  And so here's just a late, here's just another story here. By the way, even CNN is being forced
[2:02:02.580 --> 2:02:10.580]  to cover this heart inflammation condition looked like heart attack in kids after getting the COVID
[2:02:10.580 --> 2:02:19.140]  19 vaccine, according to pediatricians, K E Y T, a local NBC. And then it was also covered by CNN
[2:02:19.140 --> 2:02:25.540]  having to admit this. The teenage boys all looked like they were having heart attacks.
[2:02:25.540 --> 2:02:30.900]  They complained of chest pain and general discomfort and tests looked at first as if they
[2:02:30.900 --> 2:02:37.860]  were suffering an acute myocardial infraction, a heart attack. But they weren't. Instead,
[2:02:37.860 --> 2:02:43.060]  the seven years age 14 to 19 were suffering from a very rare type of heart inflammation
[2:02:43.060 --> 2:02:49.140]  inflammation linked to COVID 19 vaccines. So the COVID 19 gives you cancer and heart attacks.
[2:02:49.140 --> 2:02:55.060]  And then they just say, Oh, well, you know, it's not actually cancer. It's not actually a heart
[2:02:55.060 --> 2:02:58.420]  attack. It's just a rare side effect of the vaccine. Well, what the hell does that mean?
[2:02:58.420 --> 2:03:05.140]  It means they're covering it up. The vaccines are giving you cancer. They are giving you heart
[2:03:05.140 --> 2:03:14.580]  attacks. You're not even allowed to say that. But that's just it is. Oh, I'm not saying it's
[2:03:14.580 --> 2:03:20.420]  giving you a heart attack. I'm saying it's giving you heart attack like symptoms. Oh,
[2:03:20.420 --> 2:03:26.100]  oh, I'm not saying the vaccine gives you cancer. I'm just saying it shows up as cancer when we do
[2:03:26.100 --> 2:03:39.780]  tests. It's like Dr. Spachemin. It's like, Oh, how come my kid is having a heart attack after the
[2:03:39.780 --> 2:03:48.740]  vaccine? That's not a heart attack. That's just heart attack like symptoms. Hey, you say we
[2:03:48.740 --> 2:03:53.460]  shouldn't have cancer screenings after we get the COVID 19 vaccine. Why is that? Well, because you
[2:03:53.460 --> 2:04:02.980]  test positive for cancer. But it's just a test. Oh, you're having cancer like symptoms from the
[2:04:02.980 --> 2:04:09.860]  vaccine. Oh, you're having heart attack like symptoms. You're nine years old. You just got the
[2:04:09.860 --> 2:04:13.460]  vaccine and you're having heart attack like symptoms. Well, those are just symptoms of the
[2:04:13.460 --> 2:04:20.020]  vaccine. Just heart attack like symptoms. The guy falls over in the middle of a soccer game. He got
[2:04:20.020 --> 2:04:24.820]  the COVID vaccine collapses in the middle of a soccer game. They Oh, Oh, he's just having heart
[2:04:24.820 --> 2:04:30.340]  attack like symptoms. It's not a heart attack. It's heart attack like symptoms from the vaccine.
[2:04:30.340 --> 2:04:37.460]  Big difference. So it's not Oh, the vaccine causes heart attacks. It's Oh, the vaccine causes heart
[2:04:37.460 --> 2:04:43.700]  attack like symptoms. Oh, the vaccine doesn't cause cancer. It just shows up that you have cancer
[2:04:43.700 --> 2:04:54.340]  after you get it. How about the freakiest part? People get the vaccine and then they become
[2:04:54.340 --> 2:05:01.780]  magnetized. And by the way, now it's unvaccinated people or non-vaccinated people becoming
[2:05:01.780 --> 2:05:10.260]  magnetized. I have people that contact me who work as nurses or work in health care and they say
[2:05:10.260 --> 2:05:14.260]  we've never been vaccinated. But because we're in hospitals all day long, we're around vaccinated
[2:05:14.260 --> 2:05:20.660]  people and now they're magnetic. There's a guy in India who they look at as he's like a superhero
[2:05:20.660 --> 2:05:25.700]  now got the COVID vaccine says after I got the COVID vaccine, I turned into a human magnet.
[2:05:25.700 --> 2:05:30.820]  He's like a legend like comic book carrier character in India just sticks everything to him
[2:05:30.820 --> 2:05:36.100]  like dozens of forks and knives and everything. And it's like, Oh, look, he's a superhero. He's
[2:05:36.100 --> 2:05:43.940]  got special powers. Oh, the COVID-19 vaccine doesn't turn you into a magnet. You just have
[2:05:43.940 --> 2:05:50.580]  magnet like symptoms. Oh, I mean, this is, but, but so here's the sickest level I didn't even get
[2:05:50.580 --> 2:06:01.220]  to. Here's the woodchipper part. Now again, I don't like taking news off of Twitter and Twitter
[2:06:01.220 --> 2:06:05.540]  accounts because you just never know what's really behind it. It could be a bot. It could be
[2:06:05.540 --> 2:06:11.860]  fake. It could be anything. And by the way, this is just the crew pulling up all these stories of
[2:06:11.860 --> 2:06:16.340]  all these other people being magnetized. I mean, it's just crazy. Yeah, it's like, go home, check
[2:06:16.340 --> 2:06:23.860]  yourself. I'm freaking. And so I don't like making news reports or stories out of these Twitter
[2:06:23.860 --> 2:06:27.540]  accounts because you really never know. But I went back, I looked at this lady's Twitter account,
[2:06:27.540 --> 2:06:32.820]  appears to be real. It's hard to believe these are real people. But I mean, it's either it's
[2:06:32.820 --> 2:06:37.140]  either a real hardcore leftist or some bot that's just a leftist bot.
[2:06:40.340 --> 2:06:44.100]  And so guys, will you please print me the other tweet that I sent you from this lady,
[2:06:44.100 --> 2:06:51.620]  from the other, uh, because it ties it all together. So here's this lady on Twitter. Her
[2:06:51.620 --> 2:06:59.540]  name is Tammy Burgess. And this tweets now going totally viral. A week ago today, my brother's 13
[2:06:59.540 --> 2:07:06.740]  year old son had his second COVID shot. Three days later, he died. The initial autopsy results
[2:07:06.740 --> 2:07:11.620]  were that his heart was enlarged and there was some fluid surrounding it. You mean a heart attack?
[2:07:11.620 --> 2:07:18.740]  Huh? Oh, he had no known health problems was on no medications. So again, vaccine gives him a heart
[2:07:18.740 --> 2:07:22.180]  attack. Oh, no, no, no, I'm sorry. It's not a heart attack. It's heart attack like symptoms.
[2:07:22.180 --> 2:07:25.300]  Big difference. Come on, man. Cool. You can't say it's giving you a heart attack. It's
[2:07:25.300 --> 2:07:32.580]  heart attack like symptoms. You know, so wicked. Then she has all these people responding saying,
[2:07:32.580 --> 2:07:36.420]  Oh, my kid's about to get the second shot. I'm nervous or I was thinking about vaccinating
[2:07:36.420 --> 2:07:40.580]  my kids, but I'm seeing all these people die. I'm not going to do it now. And she's responding,
[2:07:41.140 --> 2:07:47.220]  still promoting the vaccine saying, I would definitely still get your kid vaccinated.
[2:07:48.260 --> 2:07:52.740]  So here she is saying a kid died from the vaccine, but then promoting it. Now here she is
[2:07:52.740 --> 2:08:00.180]  is in December of 2020 saying casting doubt on vaccine safety might result in millions of deaths.
[2:08:01.140 --> 2:08:10.500]  Oh, the irony. So what do you think of reporting on a vaccine killing your own family members
[2:08:10.500 --> 2:08:17.300]  is going to do? Oh, but see in her own twisted leftist ideology, her own brainwashing, she
[2:08:17.300 --> 2:08:22.820]  realizes, uh-oh. Yeah, that's right. If people learn the vaccine is killing people, then they
[2:08:22.820 --> 2:08:29.780]  might not get it. Duh. But then she says, Oh, I don't want people to not be, I don't want people
[2:08:29.780 --> 2:08:35.060]  to be afraid of the vaccine because it's life saving. So she admits the vaccine kills people,
[2:08:35.060 --> 2:08:39.060]  but then she says she doesn't want negative reporting on the vaccine out there because
[2:08:39.060 --> 2:08:43.540]  she thinks that will kill people. Do you understand how gone these people are mentally?
[2:08:43.540 --> 2:08:48.660]  Liberalism is beyond a mental disorder, folks. They are under complete and total brainwashing.
[2:08:51.460 --> 2:08:57.220]  Your voice counts. When you share information, be it over the internet or in person,
[2:08:57.220 --> 2:09:02.020]  it changes the world. The globalists know their agenda is unpopular. They know you're angry.
[2:09:02.580 --> 2:09:08.020]  And now to get around big tech, it's more important than ever that we use every tool we've got.

[2:09:49.460 --> 2:09:54.420]  I don't like coming to you and saying this to be our last broadcast. I've been on there 27
[2:09:54.420 --> 2:09:58.660]  years and only the last year or so have I said that. But let me tell you, the new world orders
[2:09:58.660 --> 2:10:02.820]  breathe them down our neck. The big globalist publications are coming after us and they're
[2:10:02.820 --> 2:10:06.820]  doing everything they can to shut us down. So please pray to keep info or is on the
[2:10:06.820 --> 2:10:11.300]  air and please support the local station you're listening to as well. At the same time,
[2:10:11.300 --> 2:10:16.980]  go to info or store.com while you still can and get a book, get a film, get a t-shirt,
[2:10:16.980 --> 2:10:22.500]  get some supplements because it's that money that helps us stay on air in the face of this thing.
[2:10:22.500 --> 2:10:26.980]  I need your help more than ever now. I want to keep fighting the globalist but I
[2:10:26.980 --> 2:10:32.580]  can't do it if you don't support us. So pray for us, word of mouth, tell folks about the broadcast
[2:10:32.580 --> 2:10:38.020]  however you can and buy great products that will enrich you and your family's lives every day
[2:10:38.020 --> 2:10:43.140]  at infoorstore.com. Whether it's high quality coffee or supplements or books or films,
[2:10:43.140 --> 2:10:48.980]  all of it nurtures the soul, all of it empowers humanity, all of it is pro-human and pro-god.
[2:10:48.980 --> 2:10:54.020]  Thank you so much. Again, I don't like to lecture people I'm a very private person but because
[2:10:54.020 --> 2:10:58.580]  of the globalist, their attack on humanity, I've been forced the last 27 years to be a public figure
[2:10:58.580 --> 2:11:04.420]  and we've given the globalist one hell of a run for their money because of God and I know some of
[2:11:04.420 --> 2:11:08.180]  our listeners get mad when I talk about God all day but just give me a break. The Satanism's out
[2:11:08.180 --> 2:11:12.740]  of the open. I've always been a Christian but now the fact that it's a fight between good and evil
[2:11:12.740 --> 2:11:17.460]  is so clear and I get it. While you've been turned off by big churches, while you've been turned off
[2:11:17.460 --> 2:11:23.620]  by the corrupt priest class system and I get it, me too. Believe me, I'm one of them but it's that
[2:11:23.620 --> 2:11:30.180]  relationship with God and just God's universe that God created that is so essential and God
[2:11:30.180 --> 2:11:34.820]  created the universe for us to have communion with God through and to have life and so that's
[2:11:34.820 --> 2:11:38.660]  what infill wars is really all about. So thank you all for your word of mouth. Thank you for
[2:11:38.660 --> 2:11:42.580]  spreading the word about infill wars and thank you for supporting us to keep us on air by visiting
[2:11:42.580 --> 2:11:47.380]  infillwarstore.com because without your daily and weekly monthly purchases, we'll be taken off the
[2:11:47.380 --> 2:11:55.380]  air. So thank you for the support infillwarstore.com. You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[2:11:55.380 --> 2:12:21.700]  There is so much developing here and I think what we're gonna see in the coming weeks is they have
[2:12:21.700 --> 2:12:30.260]  to cover up the vaccine deaths that are about to really start to take off and I think they're
[2:12:30.260 --> 2:12:39.220]  gonna do that with the revelations that this did come out of the lab. There's gonna have to be some
[2:12:39.220 --> 2:12:45.380]  kind of twist there because they can't be fully transparent about that lab. They can't be fully
[2:12:45.380 --> 2:12:49.780]  transparent about the Chinese military involvement and they can't be fully transparent about the
[2:12:49.780 --> 2:12:56.740]  U.S. government involvement and big tax involvement but they need something right now to distract
[2:12:56.740 --> 2:13:04.660]  from all the vaccine deaths and I just got another story out of a Taiwanese news agency
[2:13:05.780 --> 2:13:12.260]  that said in the last three days 56 people have died from the AstraZeneca COVID vaccine
[2:13:12.260 --> 2:13:21.780]  that are now being investigated by a health agency there. So I don't know what they're
[2:13:21.780 --> 2:13:27.140]  gonna do to cover this up because when you vaccinate this such a large percentage of the
[2:13:27.140 --> 2:13:33.220]  population which I'm really not even sure what it would be but let's go ahead and actually roll
[2:13:33.220 --> 2:13:39.940]  this clip now because again I just saw this story in the break. A Taiwanese news source saying that
[2:13:39.940 --> 2:13:46.500]  in three days the AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine killed 56 people and a health agency is investigating
[2:13:47.140 --> 2:13:53.700]  so when you try to have they say they want 80% vaccinated in the west within the next two weeks
[2:13:54.340 --> 2:13:59.940]  so I mean yeah you're gonna have people that die people that have all these different side
[2:13:59.940 --> 2:14:05.460]  effects like heart attack like symptoms cancer like symptoms paralysis blood clotting all of it
[2:14:05.460 --> 2:14:14.660]  and you're not going to be able to cover it up so how do you have the media not report on it well
[2:14:14.660 --> 2:14:22.660]  you distract them now with the Wuhan lab story which was really revealed in January and February
[2:14:22.660 --> 2:14:27.860]  of 2020 but they didn't cover it then so now they'll cover it to cover up all the vaccine deaths
[2:14:27.860 --> 2:14:31.540]  but how many people are really getting vaccinated let's take a look at this uh this is a
[2:14:31.540 --> 2:14:37.700]  high school graduation do we know where this is from guys
[2:14:40.900 --> 2:14:46.580]  okay so I'm not sure what state this is in the cruel time to find out as we play this
[2:14:47.380 --> 2:14:56.020]  but this is a high school graduation segregated a vaxed section and a non-vaxed section
[2:14:56.020 --> 2:15:03.700]  and so guys let's just go ahead and roll this so I'm guessing that's the the vaccinated section
[2:15:03.700 --> 2:15:14.580]  is almost completely empty three two one go and then uh I guess uh it was that music from the video
[2:15:17.860 --> 2:15:22.980]  so yeah that was just music from this video so I'm guessing that it they so the people in
[2:15:22.980 --> 2:15:30.340]  so they so they let the vaccinated people sit on the field for graduation and the
[2:15:30.340 --> 2:15:35.780]  unvaccinated people had to be in the bleachers and there's about a hundred people in the vaccinated
[2:15:35.780 --> 2:15:42.340]  section and about a thousand people in the unvaccinated section now again I'm not sure
[2:15:42.340 --> 2:15:49.220]  where this high school graduation is at this is in the state of Washington thank you crew
[2:15:49.220 --> 2:16:00.980]  so if these numbers are any indication of where we're at as a nation what would you say 15 percent
[2:16:00.980 --> 2:16:07.380]  of the population has been vaccinated it's hard for me you know this is one that we could probably
[2:16:07.380 --> 2:16:13.460]  actually go out and find out maybe you know we've got so many great people now that are on board at
[2:16:13.460 --> 2:16:19.780]  band.video so many independent journalists that are there too so I mean folks you gotta understand
[2:16:19.780 --> 2:16:24.820]  like you know it's time for it and people are doing it I'm glad to see it I'm just saying like
[2:16:24.820 --> 2:16:30.660]  I'm just like wargaming out here on air how can we get a real number of vaccinated versus
[2:16:30.660 --> 2:16:36.820]  unvaccinated and I guess one way to just go out on the streets and just ask people just ask people
[2:16:36.820 --> 2:16:41.940]  and just see what the you know the the returns are there because that's a high school graduation
[2:16:41.940 --> 2:16:45.780]  probably a pretty fair depiction in eastern Washington about 10 percent of the people there
[2:16:45.780 --> 2:16:54.900]  got vaccinated the other 90 didn't but I'm saying even through my experience I don't think I could
[2:16:54.900 --> 2:17:00.500]  give you a fair number because when I'm with the people that I know and when I go to the places
[2:17:00.500 --> 2:17:07.060]  that I go here in Austin there's not too many most people aren't vaccinated so by that measurement
[2:17:07.060 --> 2:17:14.500]  I'd say 20 percent of the population is vaccinated but then if I do go out and and I'm just talking
[2:17:14.500 --> 2:17:18.340]  to people at some random place let's say I go to you know a bar or something and then you'll find
[2:17:18.340 --> 2:17:23.060]  out yeah most people are vaccinated at least above 50 percent so it's tough to get a real
[2:17:23.060 --> 2:17:27.220]  number on that I guess just going out and asking people is the best way or looking at these videos
[2:17:27.220 --> 2:17:32.660]  where people are getting segregated uh based on the vaccine is the best way but they're obviously
[2:17:32.660 --> 2:17:38.740]  lying about the numbers there's no way 80 percent of the population is going to be vaccinated by
[2:17:38.740 --> 2:17:42.420]  July 4th but they may claim they may try to make that claim
[2:17:45.780 --> 2:17:52.740]  but man oh man what yeah and they do have vaccine passports they're covering that up too
[2:17:52.740 --> 2:17:59.460]  the vaccine passport is a very real thing ladies and gentlemen and it is already being implemented
[2:17:59.460 --> 2:18:09.140]  in many places not completely enforced yet in those areas but it is there so man oh man but
[2:18:10.820 --> 2:18:21.140]  again how do you properly illustrate the Stockholm syndrome of people that get the
[2:18:21.140 --> 2:18:26.660]  vaccine and have horrible side effects but still promote it who have family that get the vaccine
[2:18:26.660 --> 2:18:37.220]  and die but still promote it they're in a cult and it's this level of never wanting to admit
[2:18:37.220 --> 2:18:41.620]  that they were wrong about anything because then they'd have to admit that they were wrong about
[2:18:41.620 --> 2:18:47.060]  everything and so they're clinging to their false narratives they're clinging to their
[2:18:47.060 --> 2:18:50.980]  false narratives of covid they're clinging to their false narratives about the vaccine
[2:18:50.980 --> 2:18:58.340]  they're clinging to their false narratives about January 6th they cling to these lies because if
[2:18:58.340 --> 2:19:04.260]  they admit one of these things was a lie they have to admit all of them were a lie and so they
[2:19:04.260 --> 2:19:10.100]  hate the fact that it's mostly Trump supporters that are the most vocal about this at least
[2:19:11.540 --> 2:19:17.460]  they hate the fact that or or whether it's info wars or the gateway pundit or whatever
[2:19:17.460 --> 2:19:22.580]  reporting on it they hate the fact that we're out here for over six months now telling people
[2:19:22.580 --> 2:19:26.820]  that this vaccine is going to be deadly this vaccine is going to have horrendous side effects
[2:19:26.820 --> 2:19:33.860]  they hate us so much that they just discount whatever we say doesn't matter we have the proof
[2:19:34.660 --> 2:19:42.100]  doesn't matter it's just mainstream news at the time and so it shows you the level of commitment
[2:19:42.100 --> 2:19:49.940]  to their cult it shows you how complete the brainwashing is it shows you how they are literally
[2:19:49.940 --> 2:20:01.620]  right now in a pattern of mind control mind control mind control i mean this is epic you're
[2:20:01.620 --> 2:20:08.020]  talking about millions of people that are under complete mind control ladies and gentlemen that
[2:20:08.020 --> 2:20:15.060]  is not an exaggeration they are under a spell they are under mind control and so much of it is
[2:20:15.060 --> 2:20:19.940]  derivative of the hatred that they're taught so they hate trump they hate trump supporters they
[2:20:19.940 --> 2:20:24.980]  hate america they hate you so when you say six months ago this vaccine is going to have deadly
[2:20:24.980 --> 2:20:30.740]  side effects and a lot of bad side effects they deny it then when it all comes true and it happens
[2:20:30.740 --> 2:20:38.100]  to them and it happens to their family they just say no still get the vaccine that's how committed
[2:20:38.100 --> 2:20:44.980]  they are to their brainwashing that's how deep their Stockholm syndrome is that's how overwhelming
[2:20:44.980 --> 2:20:54.500]  their hatred is that's their commitment to this crime your voice counts when you share information
[2:20:54.500 --> 2:20:59.940]  be it over the internet or in person it changes the world the globalists know their agenda is

[2:23:56.820 --> 2:24:01.060]  reason and amongst all this stupidity wanted to warn people i've been trying to get a hold
[2:24:01.060 --> 2:24:08.100]  of you for a year okay i'm a double amputee and i have bacteria infection on my lung that'll never
[2:24:08.100 --> 2:24:14.500]  go away uh living defense saved my life they had me on antibiotics for two years that almost killed
[2:24:14.500 --> 2:24:20.980]  me living defense brought me back i wanted to just quote from the bible jesus is saying as to where
[2:24:20.980 --> 2:24:28.180]  we are right now this is matthew 24 verse nine then they shall deliver you up to be afflicted
[2:24:28.180 --> 2:24:35.300]  and shall kill you and you shall be hated of all nations for my name sake and then shall many be
[2:24:35.300 --> 2:24:40.900]  offended and shall betray one another and shall hate one another that's right where we're at brother
[2:24:40.900 --> 2:24:45.620]  and that's because god's name is on the founding of this country no matter what they say and that's
[2:24:45.620 --> 2:25:01.540]  why the enemy hates it because god created this country you're listening to the alex jones show
[2:25:01.540 --> 2:25:23.620]  the media's commitment they're bold the latent commitment to protecting the crimes of the
[2:25:23.620 --> 2:25:29.540]  biden family is really incredible in fact i'm not sure what's more bold the biden's and they're
[2:25:29.540 --> 2:25:35.380]  willing to commit crimes just right in front of the public and broad daylight or the fact that the
[2:25:35.380 --> 2:25:40.100]  media is so in the tank for the biden crime family that they won't report on it both are pretty
[2:25:40.100 --> 2:25:48.260]  astounding the latest has to be hunter biden's art scandal here's a guy who's never sold art before
[2:25:48.260 --> 2:25:54.500]  never been an artist before selling art for a million dollars half a million dollars to secret
[2:25:54.500 --> 2:26:01.060]  it buyers that's right nobody gets to know who the buyers are so when joe biden said hey none of my
[2:26:01.060 --> 2:26:06.180]  family members will be in my administration as a shot at trump well i guess hunter biden isn't
[2:26:06.180 --> 2:26:11.860]  an official member of the administration but believe me he is selling influence and access
[2:26:12.660 --> 2:26:19.060]  laundering that access and influence with the money involved through his artwork hunter biden
[2:26:19.060 --> 2:26:24.500]  now the number one selling artist in america not even an artist a guy that smokes parmesan cheese
[2:26:24.500 --> 2:26:30.820]  because he's so addicted to crack and so this is going on the media is covering it up they won't
[2:26:30.820 --> 2:26:35.060]  even report on it just like they don't report on any other of the crimes of the biden family
[2:26:35.060 --> 2:26:40.980]  just like they've covered up for all of the scandals of hunter biden this will be yet another one
[2:26:40.980 --> 2:26:46.500]  and perhaps the most blatant one i mean at least the stuff that came off of his emails you know
[2:26:46.500 --> 2:26:51.140]  you know that wasn't out in the public we had to get the emails and then those had to be released
[2:26:51.140 --> 2:26:54.420]  for us to see all the stuff that hunter was up to all the sorted activities there
[2:26:55.140 --> 2:26:59.620]  but this is just broad daylight hey hunter biden selling his art for half a million dollars a
[2:26:59.620 --> 2:27:06.340]  piece to secret buyers boy that's not suspicious at all so yeah biden didn't have to put hunter biden
[2:27:06.340 --> 2:27:12.260]  in his administration because he knew he'd be selling art for political influence on the side
[2:27:12.260 --> 2:27:18.180]  uh by the way though i forget the story i saw this weekend it's basically like
[2:27:18.740 --> 2:27:23.140]  12 members of the by administration have like 28 members of their family now getting paid
[2:27:23.140 --> 2:27:27.860]  by the government but that's neither here nor there that's just other nepotism but whatever
[2:27:28.420 --> 2:27:33.620]  so here is the john bound report the media won't cover this i mean it's the most obvious thing
[2:27:33.620 --> 2:27:39.140]  i've ever seen in my life it's well known people use art to launder money and other such things
[2:27:39.140 --> 2:27:43.220]  so hunter biden just does it publicly in the media doesn't even blink an eye here's the john bound
[2:27:43.220 --> 2:27:50.020]  report under the soft scrutiny of the media hunter biden has been allowed to walk away
[2:27:50.020 --> 2:27:56.100]  as the intermediary for his family's pay-to-play scheme that turned the oval office into the
[2:27:56.100 --> 2:28:02.740]  biden family's personal atm machine and now suddenly hunter biden is selling abstract paintings
[2:28:02.740 --> 2:28:09.220]  for five hundred thousand dollars a piece to unknown nefarious donors as those donors will
[2:28:09.220 --> 2:28:16.020]  remain confidential as hunter's resume of zero experience continues to land him the big money
[2:28:16.020 --> 2:28:22.580]  funneled in for the big guy in dealings with the chinese i've heard joe biden say that he's never
[2:28:22.580 --> 2:28:30.260]  discussed business with hunter that is false i first hand knowledge about this because i directly
[2:28:30.260 --> 2:28:38.180]  dealt with the biden family including joe biden did you and your father ever discuss ukraine no
[2:28:38.820 --> 2:28:44.420]  as i said the only time was after a news account it wasn't a discussion in any way there's no but
[2:28:44.420 --> 2:28:47.940]  to this no we never did your dad said i hope you know what you're doing i hope you know what you're
[2:28:47.940 --> 2:28:52.980]  doing i do and i said i do and that was literally the end of our discussion what did ukraine
[2:28:52.980 --> 2:28:59.700]  charges about you have been debunked and were unfair there's one thing that a lot of democrats
[2:28:59.700 --> 2:29:06.340]  even do wonder about and that is hunter biden your son was getting paid a lot of money to serve on
[2:29:06.340 --> 2:29:11.300]  the board of a ukraine energy company facing serious corruption charges you were the vice
[2:29:11.300 --> 2:29:17.940]  president running point on ukraine the average joe hears that and says that sounds fishy what's
[2:29:17.940 --> 2:29:22.740]  your understanding of what your son was doing for an extraordinary amount of money i don't know
[2:29:22.740 --> 2:29:27.700]  what he was doing i know he was on the board i found out he was on the board after he was on the board
[2:29:27.700 --> 2:29:35.060]  and that was it joe biden met with ukrainian russian and kazakhstani business associates of his sons
[2:29:35.060 --> 2:29:41.540]  at a dinner in washington dc while he was vice president according to records on hunter biden's
[2:29:41.540 --> 2:29:47.300]  abandoned laptop hunter's soho art dealer has strong ties to china and was once arrested for
[2:29:47.300 --> 2:29:54.020]  terroristic threats also hunter never relinquished his 10 stake in the chinese company bhr partners
[2:29:54.020 --> 2:29:59.940]  that is partly owned by the bank of china so while hunter biden clearly funnels foreign donations
[2:29:59.940 --> 2:30:05.780]  through his pitiful artwork and the fbi remains silent on the contents of hunter's laptop from
[2:30:05.780 --> 2:30:12.580]  hell and joe biden continues the cover-up it begs the question just how deep does this go the cia has
[2:30:12.580 --> 2:30:17.700]  had a hand in the abstract art world since the cold war the institution admitted to it over eight years
[2:30:17.700 --> 2:30:23.300]  ago as the independent reported unknown to the artist the new american art was secretly promoted
[2:30:23.300 --> 2:30:30.500]  under a policy known as the long leash the decision to include culture and art in the us cold war
[2:30:30.500 --> 2:30:38.180]  arsenal was taken as soon as the cia was founded in 1947 its agents were placed in the film industry
[2:30:38.180 --> 2:30:45.140]  in publishing houses even as travel writers for the celebrated photo guides and we now know it
[2:30:45.140 --> 2:30:52.500]  promoted america's anarchic avant-garde movement abstract expressionism bar grotko orange red yellow
[2:30:53.140 --> 2:31:01.540]  and 24 million dollars starts 24 million dollars now at 24 million 25 million 26 million at 26 27
[2:31:01.540 --> 2:31:08.340]  million 28 million 29 million just how stupid does the biden crime family think the american people
[2:31:08.340 --> 2:31:15.460]  are and if they get away with this they can get away with absolutely anything john bound reporting
[2:31:17.140 --> 2:31:26.980]  seriously i mean this is so obvious i mean you're just you just had a loss for words at this point
[2:31:26.980 --> 2:31:35.940]  at how corrupt the american media is the cover-up of the biden crime family the protection that the
[2:31:35.940 --> 2:31:44.900]  media runs for the bidens and the democrat party is just criminal it's unbelievable
[2:31:46.660 --> 2:31:53.860]  so i mean what do you even do at this point when everything has become so corrupted the
[2:31:53.860 --> 2:31:58.660]  media all of our institutions our law enforcement our judicial branch i mean
[2:32:00.020 --> 2:32:04.260]  that all the crimes of the biden family can just be well known in public from their own
[2:32:04.260 --> 2:32:10.820]  documents from their own activity their own words and the media just says oh this doesn't exist
[2:32:12.820 --> 2:32:18.260]  and that's it and they continue to run their gambit they continue to run their crimes
[2:32:20.020 --> 2:32:27.700]  stunning really stunning i mean i just oh boy
[2:32:27.700 --> 2:32:33.780]  what do you do but it's kind of like this how they cover up the election theft
[2:32:37.860 --> 2:32:43.140]  we caught them trump has recently put out new statements president trump warned raffensberger
[2:32:43.140 --> 2:32:47.860]  and his attorney ryan germany about election fraud new evidence shows germany was made aware
[2:32:49.380 --> 2:32:54.260]  of election fraud on election night and hid this from president trump same with raffensberger
[2:32:54.260 --> 2:32:58.180]  who said oh i did an independent investigation we found no chain of command issues nothing
[2:32:59.780 --> 2:33:04.980]  now even raffensberger is coming out and saying oh wait well you have chain of command problems we
[2:33:04.980 --> 2:33:10.580]  do have sequential ballots uh we do have a legal balance this is odd after all the facts so he
[2:33:10.580 --> 2:33:14.660]  covered it up at the time now he's willing to come out and talk about it but it's too late
[2:33:14.660 --> 2:33:25.140]  or is it there was a hearing today in georgia on folton county that's atlanta absentee ballot
[2:33:25.140 --> 2:33:28.820]  audit and that's where they had the no chain of command that's illegal so they shouldn't have
[2:33:28.820 --> 2:33:33.460]  counted no chain of command record and they had sequential ballots some of which were never even
[2:33:33.460 --> 2:33:36.980]  folded mail-in ballots never folded no creasing them you know what that means right they were
[2:33:36.980 --> 2:33:44.820]  never mailed out so that's all coming out during these hearings and just like in colorado when
[2:33:44.820 --> 2:33:50.100]  it was suggested that there be a vote audit in colorado like the one in arizona the democrats
[2:33:50.100 --> 2:33:57.060]  in colorado made it illegal they made it illegal to audit well now nevada is doing the same thing
[2:33:57.060 --> 2:34:04.100]  so trump won nevada too probably state g o p chair once arizona style audit nevada democrat
[2:34:04.100 --> 2:34:09.700]  leadership pushes back so they made it illegal in colorado to audit the vote and now the democrats
[2:34:09.700 --> 2:34:14.580]  in nevada are trying to do the same thing so trump won colorado and trump won nevada that's what that
[2:34:14.580 --> 2:34:22.980]  means so what does that put trump at now like 340 on the electoral college now that we know
[2:34:22.980 --> 2:34:28.580]  all the states that was stolen from trump for biden nevada georgia arizona wisconsin michigan
[2:34:28.580 --> 2:34:36.900]  pennsylvania new hampshire and our media is in on all of it man they are in on all of it

[2:36:49.680 --> 2:36:56.440]  Big Pharma was born out of the Rockefeller oil industry in 1900 with the petrochemical.
[2:36:56.440 --> 2:37:02.680]  The petrochemical then dominated two major industries, plastics and drugs.
[2:37:02.680 --> 2:37:07.840]  Companies began synthesizing patented versions of naturally sourced drugs.
[2:37:07.840 --> 2:37:11.400]  The natural sources were then made illegal.
[2:37:11.400 --> 2:37:16.680]  Nutrients became medicine and the sicker people got the more their industry grew.
[2:37:16.680 --> 2:37:20.480]  It's a death cult and it's up to the individual to escape.
[2:37:20.480 --> 2:37:26.960]  Good health begins with a healthy immune system which needs the proper nutrients to thrive.
[2:37:26.960 --> 2:37:30.440]  Nutrients we cannot readily get from our food today.
[2:37:30.440 --> 2:37:35.480]  The combinations of vitamin C and zinc and vitamin D3 with calcium have been proven to
[2:37:35.480 --> 2:37:39.840]  be what we need to maintain a healthy immune system.
[2:37:39.840 --> 2:37:45.400]  Go to infostore.com and start supporting your natural immune system now with the Mega Immune

[2:37:57.400 --> 2:38:01.200]  huge effects with what we've done here in Info Wars.

[2:38:52.760 --> 2:39:16.840]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[2:39:16.840 --> 2:39:20.760]  Alright this is my final segment here hosting the Alex Jones show, Owen Troyer filling in
[2:39:20.760 --> 2:39:24.960]  today while Alex is on the road working.
[2:39:24.960 --> 2:39:27.200]  I will be hosting the War Room again three to six p.m.
[2:39:27.200 --> 2:39:29.520]  I'm going to take calls there too.
[2:39:29.520 --> 2:39:33.040]  So anything I've talked about today on the Alex Jones show, I'll take calls on on the
[2:39:33.040 --> 2:39:34.040]  War Room.
[2:39:34.040 --> 2:39:40.280]  We'll also be joined by Noor Bin Laden who was almost arrested for waving a Trump one
[2:39:40.280 --> 2:39:44.040]  flag outside of the Biden-Putin summit in Switzerland.
[2:39:44.040 --> 2:39:47.560]  So that's what's coming up on the War Room.
[2:39:47.560 --> 2:39:54.240]  Let me do just a news blitz here on some of the rest of the news on my desk before I take
[2:39:54.240 --> 2:39:59.720]  off and Gerald Salente takes over.
[2:39:59.720 --> 2:40:05.160]  This is becoming a trend in many different industries.
[2:40:05.160 --> 2:40:09.520]  American Airlines cancels hundreds of flights amid staffing and maintenance issues.
[2:40:09.520 --> 2:40:16.640]  So I mean this has just been a weird phenomenon to witness and experience even firsthand since
[2:40:16.640 --> 2:40:23.760]  the fake pandemic shutdown of just the service industry not being able to get back to where
[2:40:23.760 --> 2:40:27.920]  it was at, not being able to recoup it and really being worse off than I've ever seen
[2:40:27.920 --> 2:40:29.440]  it in my life.
[2:40:29.440 --> 2:40:35.040]  Not just with supply chain shortages but just people don't give a damn anymore.
[2:40:35.040 --> 2:40:38.760]  And I guess it's because they figure they can get on unemployment or they're on unemployment
[2:40:38.760 --> 2:40:40.560]  so they don't want to go back to work.
[2:40:40.560 --> 2:40:43.280]  It's a very strange thing.
[2:40:43.280 --> 2:40:47.560]  And most businesses at least I'm saying here in Austin are so desperate to get people working
[2:40:47.560 --> 2:40:52.000]  they're starting wages right now are $15 or $20 an hour.
[2:40:52.000 --> 2:40:53.960]  I'm not that old folks.
[2:40:53.960 --> 2:40:55.120]  I am not that old.
[2:40:55.120 --> 2:40:57.520]  I'm 31.
[2:40:57.520 --> 2:41:06.080]  And I mean even when I was young and working had my first job I believe when I was 14
[2:41:06.080 --> 2:41:13.000]  refing soccer games which was actually good money compared to the hourly wages I got.
[2:41:13.000 --> 2:41:18.160]  I mean I remember you had to work at a job for at least a year or two before you could
[2:41:18.160 --> 2:41:22.920]  even get to $10 an hour and you felt great when you got to that.
[2:41:22.920 --> 2:41:29.560]  Now people are so desperate to hire they're offering bonuses just to get interviewed and
[2:41:29.560 --> 2:41:35.800]  starting wages at $15, $20 an hour and they still can't staff.
[2:41:35.800 --> 2:41:38.440]  They still can't get accrued.
[2:41:38.440 --> 2:41:43.760]  So this is just the collapse of the service industry in many different fronts that we
[2:41:43.760 --> 2:41:47.480]  are witnessing right now.
[2:41:47.480 --> 2:41:51.080]  This is just wild but it shows you where the left is at.
[2:41:51.080 --> 2:41:56.280]  And so we don't you know it's not something we do for shock jock radio when we talk about
[2:41:56.280 --> 2:42:03.640]  the sex cults that have all of their operatives inside government.
[2:42:03.640 --> 2:42:04.720]  It's very real.
[2:42:04.720 --> 2:42:06.960]  It's beyond just the Epstein blackmailing.
[2:42:06.960 --> 2:42:10.520]  You know there's active members of these sex cults that get into government.
[2:42:10.520 --> 2:42:21.360]  For example, Zach Wiener go figure, Zach Wiener 26 year old city council in Manhattan.
[2:42:21.360 --> 2:42:24.920]  A candidate well a candidate no more.
[2:42:24.920 --> 2:42:33.840]  He was in a dominatrix sex video getting tortured for sexual pleasure.
[2:42:33.840 --> 2:42:37.320]  Do I need to tell you what party he was affiliated with?
[2:42:37.320 --> 2:42:40.040]  Do I need to tell you that?
[2:42:40.040 --> 2:42:44.100]  And no I think that one's pretty obvious isn't it?
[2:42:44.100 --> 2:42:52.800]  And so apparently he's a regular at this BDSM dungeon where they do sex torture on you.
[2:42:52.800 --> 2:42:57.520]  And he was going to be in city council as a democrat.
[2:42:57.520 --> 2:43:01.880]  So yeah that's pretty commonplace actually in the democrat party.
[2:43:01.880 --> 2:43:08.040]  You may be surprised maybe not but you know the people that hang out with Ed Buck, the
[2:43:08.040 --> 2:43:12.480]  people that sleep with Chinese spies like Eric Swalwell, people that promote drag queen
[2:43:12.480 --> 2:43:16.520]  story time and teaching your kids how to masturbate yeah that's the democrats.
[2:43:16.520 --> 2:43:23.920]  And they cancel 4th of July parades and fireworks as they launch new funding and operations
[2:43:23.920 --> 2:43:28.920]  for Juneteenth and LGBTQ pride events.
[2:43:28.920 --> 2:43:34.200]  So this is happening across the nation but national file has a story out of Chicago Illinois.
[2:43:34.200 --> 2:43:41.120]  Illinois City cancels 4th of July parade launches Juneteenth and LGBTQ pride events.
[2:43:41.120 --> 2:43:45.560]  So you're not allowed to do 4th of July celebrations because of COVID but you can go out and have
[2:43:45.560 --> 2:43:51.680]  gay orgies on the street for gay pride or riots on the street for Juneteenth and that's
[2:43:51.680 --> 2:43:53.360]  all good.
[2:43:53.360 --> 2:43:54.800]  That's all good.
[2:43:54.800 --> 2:43:59.680]  Tell me how you haven't heard about this and I haven't.
[2:43:59.680 --> 2:44:05.080]  But I saw it today on the gateway pundit.
[2:44:05.080 --> 2:44:11.520]  Biden administration and American media silent after Texas family goes missing at the border
[2:44:11.520 --> 2:44:15.480]  in cartel territory reportedly kidnapped.
[2:44:15.480 --> 2:44:19.640]  Not even a story ladies and gentlemen.
[2:44:19.640 --> 2:44:29.080]  This is devastating of family on a border town in a border town on a border ranch kidnapped
[2:44:29.080 --> 2:44:33.280]  by cartel members and the media doesn't cover it.
[2:44:33.280 --> 2:44:35.760]  See here's why this is so incredible.
[2:44:35.760 --> 2:44:41.360]  The media really at least it used to be really mostly driven by ratings and so they'd see
[2:44:41.360 --> 2:44:44.600]  a story like this and they'd say we're going to run with this 24 hours because it's going
[2:44:44.600 --> 2:44:46.280]  to be great for ratings.
[2:44:46.280 --> 2:44:50.280]  Now there's a new thing that's more important than ratings and that's protecting the Democrat
[2:44:50.280 --> 2:44:54.160]  party because they're all Democrats protecting the globalist agenda because they're all in
[2:44:54.160 --> 2:44:55.760]  on it.
[2:44:55.760 --> 2:45:02.880]  So you won't hear a bleep of this a family in Texas kidnapped by the Las Vegas Mexican
[2:45:02.880 --> 2:45:07.440]  cartel because it's bad for the Biden administration.
[2:45:07.440 --> 2:45:14.320]  A whole family kidnapped by the Mexican cartel won't be in the news because it's bad for
[2:45:14.320 --> 2:45:17.600]  the Biden administration.
[2:45:17.600 --> 2:45:25.640]  Neither will this gunman kill 15 in Mexico U.S. border town a bloody rampage rocks city
[2:45:25.640 --> 2:45:34.360]  next to McCall in Texas which is where we were at just a few months ago in Rainosa 15
[2:45:34.360 --> 2:45:38.040]  and they're saying it could be as high as 18 they haven't gotten the most updated numbers
[2:45:38.040 --> 2:45:45.080]  not in the news again they love the ratings they love the mass shootings they covered
[2:45:45.080 --> 2:45:48.840]  all the time they demonize guns not at the southern border why because it's bad for the
[2:45:48.840 --> 2:45:54.520]  Biden administration family kidnapped in the southern border bad for the Biden administration
[2:45:54.520 --> 2:46:04.480]  they don't cover it absolutely stunning or maybe not so much court upholds FDA approval
[2:46:04.480 --> 2:46:14.280]  of controversial GMO fake meat ingredient yes so get ready this is just the beginning
[2:46:14.280 --> 2:46:19.640]  of you not even be able to get meat anymore it's going to become this new thing we're
[2:46:19.640 --> 2:46:24.880]  like oh people hoard emergency food or hoard gold or cash or other stuff people are going
[2:46:24.880 --> 2:46:30.920]  to start mass buying quantities of actual beef and just freezing them knowing that they may
[2:46:30.920 --> 2:46:39.880]  not be able to get them in the future I'm not even kidding you so get ready for that
[2:46:39.880 --> 2:46:45.080]  IRS denies Texas based Christian group tax attempt status claims Bible teachings affiliated
[2:46:45.080 --> 2:46:52.320]  with GOP and there it is and there it is so that's next so now Christianity is going to
[2:46:52.320 --> 2:46:59.920]  be considered offensive because we live in fag world so because I live in the gay pride
[2:46:59.920 --> 2:47:07.680]  fag world I can't talk about Jesus or celebrate Christianity because it's offensive to all
[2:47:07.680 --> 2:47:12.800]  these militant liberals out there and see notice I didn't say it's offensive to gay people
[2:47:12.800 --> 2:47:17.560]  because it's not most gay people don't care what your religion is it's live and let live
[2:47:17.560 --> 2:47:25.640]  it's the militant radicalized hate filled left that hates Christianity doesn't matter
[2:47:25.640 --> 2:47:31.560]  if they're gay or not they hate Christians so now they're going to make the argument
[2:47:31.560 --> 2:47:36.360]  that Christianity is offensive to the LGBTQ plus movement and so therefore it needs to
[2:47:36.360 --> 2:47:42.560]  be outlawed and banned and if you wear a shirt that has Jesus on it or a crucifix around
[2:47:42.560 --> 2:47:47.000]  your neck you're bad you're a bigot you won't be able to go to a restaurant you won't be
[2:47:47.000 --> 2:47:57.160]  able to go to a ball game so this institutionally with the IRS is just a sign of where it's going
[2:47:57.160 --> 2:48:03.200]  so get ready I mean within two years most restaurants and bus stops everything will
[2:48:03.200 --> 2:48:08.520]  say oh I'm gay I love gays don't you know don't offend me because you don't like me
[2:48:08.520 --> 2:48:14.280]  because I'm gay and so it's all about ending Christianity ladies and gentlemen here's another
[2:48:14.280 --> 2:48:21.920]  example leftist furious over straight pride posters in Ireland so there's a poster going
[2:48:21.920 --> 2:48:26.800]  around Ireland that says straight pride it's got a man and a woman in wedding garments
[2:48:26.800 --> 2:48:32.160]  and this is offensive because it's far right and homophobic so being straight being heterosexual
[2:48:32.160 --> 2:48:37.920]  is now a far right thing imagine that but in a way that's it's just indicative of everything
[2:48:37.920 --> 2:48:45.240]  else common sense the truth is now considered far right wing so if you're just honest and
[2:48:45.240 --> 2:48:51.440]  have any common sense and logic left you're considered far right so hey heterosexuality
[2:48:51.440 --> 2:48:57.640]  a man and a woman makes a baby makes a nuclear family that's far right because the far left
[2:48:57.640 --> 2:49:05.920]  is far out of their minds Oxford alumni Warren woke mob wants sensitivity readers to vet
[2:49:05.920 --> 2:49:11.760]  and edit university's oldest newspaper so yeah all of these alumni that just write in
[2:49:11.760 --> 2:49:17.640]  this paper are getting edited by a bunch of woke liberal leftist mental defectives and
[2:49:17.640 --> 2:49:21.120]  they're like what the hell is this why am I being censored by a bunch of mental defectives
[2:49:21.120 --> 2:49:27.680]  here because it's the new religion of liberalism of being gay of being black and caring about
[2:49:27.680 --> 2:49:31.200]  your skin color and your sex is the first thing that totally all you care about is your
[2:49:31.200 --> 2:49:35.160]  section your skin color and if somebody offends you because of that well then they'll get cancelled
[2:49:35.160 --> 2:49:42.160]  they'll get banned I started taking high-end fish oil and high-end krill oil more than

[2:58:20.080 --> 2:58:24.800]  what you can't support info was keep the truth alive because they're locking down everything
[2:58:24.800 --> 2:58:35.760]  man anyway going back to what's going on you're estimating in New York that only 62% of the
[2:58:35.760 --> 2:58:43.280]  office workers will return mostly three days a week this is the new abnormal and I don't
[2:58:43.280 --> 2:58:47.960]  blame a man I wouldn't want to you know commute an hour and a half each way on the LIE but
[2:58:47.960 --> 2:58:55.440]  this is going to go on all around the country less people are going to be commuting so where
[2:58:55.440 --> 2:59:02.720]  is commercial real estate going to go well read your trends journal well this week's
[2:59:02.720 --> 2:59:14.400]  was only 149 pages no advertisements and how about with interest rates going up yeah New
[2:59:14.400 --> 2:59:20.000]  York City lags behind other U.S. cities and getting workers to return to office but even
[2:59:20.000 --> 2:59:26.920]  when you look at that number the office rate in the state around the states is only around
[2:59:26.920 --> 2:59:34.120]  31% and most places rebuilt and you see that picture that's how ugly New York has become
[2:59:34.120 --> 2:59:44.040]  all stealing and glass crap ugly ugly one time the place that style but styles gone
[2:59:44.040 --> 2:59:52.120]  yep we're going to get to that later too as style is dead in this country and a lot of
[2:59:52.120 --> 3:00:00.480]  place so what does it mean
[3:00:00.480 --> 3:00:08.240]  office buildings are opening up not all employees want to return this is big stuff it it it
[3:00:08.240 --> 3:00:17.240]  it's not bad is good parts to it it's a it's a new world who would have thought that there'd
[3:00:17.240 --> 3:00:23.360]  be all this online education trends are born they grow they mature each old age and die
[3:00:23.360 --> 3:00:31.840]  I've been writing in my book trends 2000 25 years ago of interactive you interactive
[3:00:31.840 --> 3:00:39.360]  university the system we have stinks was created by the Germans the Wyman Republic at the beginning
[3:00:39.360 --> 3:00:44.240]  of the industrial age people used to make all their own things by hand and it became industry
[3:00:44.240 --> 3:00:48.240]  so they took these people that couldn't work anymore and baking their own things because
[3:00:48.240 --> 3:00:53.520]  they couldn't afford to that competition wiped them out mass production and taught them how
[3:00:53.520 --> 3:01:04.360]  to read write and do math and follow orders so the new education system that has come
[3:01:04.360 --> 3:01:11.600]  about from this is big and it's an on trend pinot opportunity going back to working at
[3:01:11.600 --> 3:01:20.880]  home you know you have to commute every day and a lot of jobs and it's going to be part
[3:01:20.880 --> 3:01:28.720]  of the 21st century so what does it mean for commercial real estate the places were over
[3:01:28.720 --> 3:01:35.640]  built before in New York before this happening east side west side all around the town for
[3:01:35.640 --> 3:01:45.480]  rent for rent for rent 2019 from the West Village up to 50 and Madison Park all over
[3:01:45.480 --> 3:01:51.160]  so major companies as Colorado residents not to apply for remote positions and they're
[3:01:51.160 --> 3:01:59.160]  not alone because what you have also you got the banks the crowd we wrote about this in
[3:01:59.160 --> 3:02:08.560]  a trends journal this past week you got the guy from Morgan Stanley Gorman who is a woman
[3:02:08.560 --> 3:02:16.520]  I'm not sure they may misspelt it the chief executive of Morgan Stanley told investors
[3:02:16.520 --> 3:02:22.800]  and analysts this month if you want to get paid in New York you need to be in New York
[3:02:22.800 --> 3:02:34.840]  and then you're hearing Blackstone you're hearing J.P. Morgan Chase Jamie Diamond Jamie Cole
[3:02:34.840 --> 3:02:42.640]  Jamie crap Jamie diamond they're headed against a bank that got what did they get hit like
[3:02:42.640 --> 3:02:48.360]  five times the fines and they still do business while we the little people get our you know
[3:02:48.360 --> 3:02:53.920]  chops busted for the minor crime that we do oh you're going eight miles over the speed

[3:02:57.520 --> 3:03:06.960]  backwards but slimmers like Diamond and the rest they get a free ride yeah trading practices
[3:03:06.960 --> 3:03:12.800]  not trading practices is right they rig the precious metals market going back to them
[3:03:12.800 --> 3:03:21.680]  they're pushing big time for employees to go back to work you know why you know why
[3:03:21.680 --> 3:03:31.000]  not because it's inefficient no because these scum loaned all the money to the big guys
[3:03:31.000 --> 3:03:39.920]  to build all these big buildings and they want to get paid back because the floors are
[3:03:39.920 --> 3:03:48.160]  empty I don't need 16 floors anymore I only need two sub leases yeah they're really hot
[3:03:48.160 --> 3:03:57.880]  now these are the scum that are telling people go back to work go back to work yeah because
[3:03:57.880 --> 3:04:05.000]  they know how bad it is and now brings us back to the markets you saw what happened
[3:04:05.000 --> 3:04:14.600]  last week the bank stuff your own power yeah and one big club and you ain't in it remember
[3:04:14.600 --> 3:04:23.280]  Jesus Christ right makes his own whip drives the money changes out of the temple has his
[3:04:23.280 --> 3:04:33.640]  last supper is hanging on across the screwing with the banksters they know how bad it is
[3:04:33.640 --> 3:04:40.760]  and with interest rates going up as Powell who worked for the bankster clan as well as
[3:04:40.760 --> 3:04:48.400]  Janet Yellen who quit earlier so she could make millions of dollars shooting or for blubber
[3:04:48.400 --> 3:04:54.320]  mouth she never made any sense talking when she talked like this about that because paid
[3:04:54.320 --> 3:05:02.560]  like $270,000 to speak for an hour by the bankster clan yeah they're all a member of
[3:05:02.560 --> 3:05:09.920]  that criminal group the banksters that have made the bigs bigger the black stones the
[3:05:09.920 --> 3:05:19.480]  black rocks the blacks every the JP Morgan chases one after another they're buying up
[3:05:19.480 --> 3:05:30.720]  everything everything we become our plantation workers of slave landia they're gonna do everything
[3:05:30.720 --> 3:05:43.400]  they can to reverse this trend and it's not going to work even at a 10% loss of people
[3:05:43.400 --> 3:05:48.080]  coming back you're losing hundreds of thousands of workers in New York all the people that
[3:05:48.080 --> 3:05:56.000]  used to buy the the bagels and the coffee and going out for drinks after was they're gone
[3:05:56.000 --> 3:06:01.120]  yeah interest rates would be good for the country treasury secretary Yellen says and
[3:06:01.120 --> 3:06:08.920]  then she backtrack on that like in 60 seconds because all that debt I was talking about
[3:06:08.920 --> 3:06:16.320]  guess what as interest rates go up that debt load goes up and by the way that debt load
[3:06:16.320 --> 3:06:23.080]  it's submerging the emerging markets because they borrow that money in dollars the greatest
[3:06:23.080 --> 3:06:31.080]  depression is on the way it's in front of everybody's eyes the gangsta bandits are in

[3:10:23.640 --> 3:10:33.000]  and i was talking before about the markets let's get this straight they closed down the
[3:10:33.000 --> 3:10:42.120]  country most of 2020 how could the equity markets go up the reason the equity markets
[3:10:42.120 --> 3:10:47.600]  went up is the unprecedented amount of money the government the federal reserve pumped
[3:10:47.600 --> 3:10:54.880]  into the system keeping interest rates near zero so the black rocks and all the big private
[3:10:54.880 --> 3:11:01.680]  equity groups all the hedge funds all the big dealers could gobble up company after
[3:11:01.680 --> 3:11:12.920]  company borrowing money for virtually nothing artificially boost the equity markets we are
[3:11:12.920 --> 3:11:21.600]  in front of our eyes this is one is going to be the biggest market crash in history
[3:11:21.600 --> 3:11:31.040]  never before in front of our eyes as it had been pumped up so artificially again the trillions
[3:11:31.040 --> 3:11:39.000]  in trillions of dollars they pumped artificially into the system to prop it up to make the
[3:11:39.000 --> 3:11:45.480]  bigs bigger and the richer richer again the trillionaires billionaires got eight trillion
[3:11:45.480 --> 3:11:51.760]  dollars richer during this time and then that new york times article i was writing about
[3:11:51.760 --> 3:11:56.080]  in new york about new york about the thousands of businesses small businesses that are gone
[3:11:56.080 --> 3:12:03.960]  out of business gone because you're not essential and let me tell you something i'm the low
[3:12:03.960 --> 3:12:11.640]  life piece of scum arrogant crap daddy's boy from a state near you that i'm gonna play
[3:12:11.640 --> 3:12:16.640]  governor and i'm gonna say who's essential and who's not essential you could go into
[3:12:16.640 --> 3:12:22.360]  walmart walk all over the places you want you could go into cost go you could go into
[3:12:22.360 --> 3:12:31.480]  target you could go into cold you could go anywhere kroger it's okay but can't go into
[3:12:31.480 --> 3:12:37.080]  that small shop over there not that and not essential and we're gonna make alcohol essential
[3:12:37.080 --> 3:12:42.000]  because they get a lot of taxes on alcohol and we're politicians we don't work a day
[3:12:42.000 --> 3:12:47.560]  in our lives all we do and all we ever have done is suck off the public tit so we need
[3:12:47.560 --> 3:12:55.520]  your tax money that's an essential business they have artificially propped up the markets
[3:12:55.520 --> 3:13:08.000]  to enrich the rich never before like is ever been done it's going to crash you go back
[3:13:08.000 --> 3:13:17.680]  read what we've been saying in the trends journal for several months listen to what
[3:13:17.680 --> 3:13:29.240]  i've been saying on info wars for several months that inflation is real the facts are
[3:13:29.240 --> 3:13:37.760]  there all you have to do is live and go out and buy things and you know how bad it is
[3:13:37.760 --> 3:13:46.440]  you don't need a lot of statistical data to support it although it does but yet you have
[3:13:46.440 --> 3:13:54.480]  the bankster bandits shooting off their fat mouths well i should say money mouths like
[3:13:54.480 --> 3:14:03.320]  what's his name over there your own powell saying that big short investor michael barry
[3:14:03.320 --> 3:14:13.720]  warns the mother of what all crashes is coming little late how long have we been saying this
[3:14:13.720 --> 3:14:21.160]  how long but hey if he said it and i respect about that it's real anyway you go back and
[3:14:21.160 --> 3:14:26.280]  listen to powell do fed share shooting his mouth off month after month after month after
[3:14:26.280 --> 3:14:30.640]  month after month after month after month after month all of them and the media repeating
[3:14:30.640 --> 3:14:38.840]  it that inflation is only temporary oh so lumber prices went way down yeah but how much
[3:14:38.840 --> 3:14:45.480]  higher are they than where they were oh they fell 50% but they're still 50% higher and they're
[3:14:45.480 --> 3:14:57.280]  going to stay in that ring so i do not give financial advice today the markets are up
[3:14:57.280 --> 3:15:02.920]  sharply and gold took a nice spike up too they're going to do everything they can to
[3:15:02.920 --> 3:15:14.320]  keep precious metals down just as the slimy lowlife pieces of garbage scum crap jp morgan
[3:15:14.320 --> 3:15:22.440]  chasted in rigging the precious metals market that is not a conspiracy theory that is a
[3:15:22.440 --> 3:15:29.320]  fact as the info wars people just put it up before about how they will find almost a
[3:15:29.320 --> 3:15:37.200]  billion dollars nine hundred million in 20 since 2019 or 2020 the screwing lead a little

[3:15:44.040 --> 3:15:51.200]  metals prices should be much higher and and as you well know and i've long been saying
[3:15:51.200 --> 3:16:00.520]  the crypto markets are going to keep rising until until governments do what they can to

[3:21:10.360 --> 3:21:12.080]  we have a real chance of defeating it.
[3:21:12.080 --> 3:21:14.560]  If we ask God for guidance, we will defeat it.
[3:21:14.560 --> 3:21:17.200]  So prayer is essential, research is essential,
[3:21:17.200 --> 3:21:18.360]  getting prepared is essential,

[3:24:56.320 --> 3:24:58.320]  Supporting your natural immune system.
[3:24:58.320 --> 3:25:01.320]  Well, I believe that's a conspiracy theory.
[3:25:01.320 --> 3:25:03.320]  You don't have to get in good health.
[3:25:03.320 --> 3:25:07.320]  You don't have to be in good health to beat the coronavirus.
[3:25:07.320 --> 3:25:09.320]  No, you need that shot.
[3:25:09.320 --> 3:25:12.320]  You need that shot up, you know you want.
[3:25:12.320 --> 3:25:14.320]  Never a word from the prostitutes
[3:25:14.320 --> 3:25:17.320]  and the mainstream media about getting healthy.
[3:25:17.320 --> 3:25:20.320]  And as you well know, I mentioned it before,
[3:25:20.320 --> 3:25:24.320]  one of my first books I worked on didn't write it.
[3:25:24.320 --> 3:25:27.320]  Natural Healing, 1984, I began working on this book,
[3:25:27.320 --> 3:25:30.320]  came out in 1986.
[3:25:30.320 --> 3:25:32.320]  The Total Health and Nutrition Program
[3:25:32.320 --> 3:25:35.320]  that helps you keep your body disease free
[3:25:35.320 --> 3:25:37.320]  every day of your life.
[3:25:37.320 --> 3:25:41.320]  But, you mean eating healthy and doing healthy things?
[3:25:41.320 --> 3:25:43.320]  No, you need that Vax.
[3:25:43.320 --> 3:25:45.320]  It's a conspiracy theory to think differently.
[3:25:45.320 --> 3:25:46.320]  And vitamins don't count.
[3:25:46.320 --> 3:25:49.320]  No, I'm Big Pharma, you're drug lords anyway.
[3:25:49.320 --> 3:25:51.320]  Talking about health, fitness, nutrition,
[3:25:51.320 --> 3:25:54.320]  the great products that they sell at InfoWars,
[3:25:54.320 --> 3:25:57.320]  and you see the people, the shape they're in,
[3:25:57.320 --> 3:26:00.320]  but look what shape America's now in.
[3:26:00.320 --> 3:26:02.320]  How about going to last Thursday's
[3:26:02.320 --> 3:26:05.320]  Toilet Paper Record in New York Times?
[3:26:05.320 --> 3:26:08.320]  This they call the business section.
[3:26:08.320 --> 3:26:11.320]  This stupid moronic stuff.
[3:26:11.320 --> 3:26:15.320]  Check these photos out.
[3:26:15.320 --> 3:26:21.320]  You see it?
[3:26:21.320 --> 3:26:27.320]  Victoria's secret swaps angels
[3:26:27.320 --> 3:26:33.320]  for what women want.
[3:26:33.320 --> 3:26:35.320]  Look at this.
[3:26:35.320 --> 3:26:38.320]  I mean, I'm not so about the color thing.
[3:26:38.320 --> 3:26:39.320]  We can't make it.
[3:26:39.320 --> 3:26:42.320]  How about black and white?
[3:26:42.320 --> 3:26:45.320]  What I mean, the chick in the middle, man,
[3:26:45.320 --> 3:26:51.320]  is not a picture of health.
[3:26:51.320 --> 3:26:54.320]  And they have the line under there.
[3:26:54.320 --> 3:26:59.320]  The lingerie brand tries to redefine
[3:26:59.320 --> 3:27:05.320]  not just the self, but the meaning of sexy.
[3:27:05.320 --> 3:27:08.320]  So I would say to anybody, person to person,
[3:27:08.320 --> 3:27:11.320]  man to man, women to women, go,
[3:27:11.320 --> 3:27:14.320]  I can't say the word, but it begins with an F
[3:27:14.320 --> 3:27:18.320]  and ends with a K yourself.
[3:27:18.320 --> 3:27:21.320]  Don't you tell me this is sexy.
[3:27:21.320 --> 3:27:27.320]  This is the epitome, the epitome of why
[3:27:27.320 --> 3:27:29.320]  the people dying from coronavirus
[3:27:29.320 --> 3:27:37.320]  that are not elderly with 2.6 comorbidities
[3:27:37.320 --> 3:27:41.320]  at a younger is type 2 diabetics
[3:27:41.320 --> 3:27:49.320]  and obesity, only of which 4%, excuse me,
[3:27:49.320 --> 3:27:56.320]  42% of Americans are 70% overweight, 42 obese.
[3:27:56.320 --> 3:28:01.320]  And these clowns are trying to tell me that this is sexy.
[3:28:01.320 --> 3:28:04.320]  Who the hell do you think you're talking to?
[3:28:04.320 --> 3:28:07.320]  You're nothing but low life scum
[3:28:07.320 --> 3:28:10.320]  that'll do anything to sell your product.
[3:28:10.320 --> 3:28:17.320]  Look at the junk that people are shoving down their throats.
[3:28:17.320 --> 3:28:20.320]  Look at the crap that people are eating.
[3:28:20.320 --> 3:28:24.320]  It all happened when fast food happened.
[3:28:24.320 --> 3:28:30.320]  Go back to my generation, 1969.
[3:28:30.320 --> 3:28:32.320]  Woodstock.
[3:28:32.320 --> 3:28:35.320]  Take a look at the pictures of Woodstock.
[3:28:35.320 --> 3:28:37.320]  People in their 20s.
[3:28:37.320 --> 3:28:40.320]  Look at the shape they're in.
[3:28:40.320 --> 3:28:45.320]  You don't see this chuch.
[3:28:45.320 --> 3:28:47.320]  You want to look like that.
[3:28:47.320 --> 3:28:48.320]  Fine.
[3:28:48.320 --> 3:28:51.320]  But don't tell me this is sexy or healthy.
[3:28:51.320 --> 3:28:54.320]  Tell me this is America going down.
[3:28:54.320 --> 3:28:57.320]  And it's been going down a long time.
[3:28:57.320 --> 3:29:00.320]  And here's another article.
[3:29:00.320 --> 3:29:01.320]  Yeah, there it is.
[3:29:01.320 --> 3:29:04.320]  Look at the shape of the people.
[3:29:04.320 --> 3:29:07.320]  Whole different world.
[3:29:07.320 --> 3:29:11.320]  Not anymore.
[3:29:11.320 --> 3:29:16.320]  Then you look at the Wall Street Journal.
[3:29:16.320 --> 3:29:20.320]  June 5th, you're going back to the office.
[3:29:20.320 --> 3:29:23.320]  What are you going to wear?
[3:29:23.320 --> 3:29:26.320]  And then they show you the photos
[3:29:26.320 --> 3:29:30.320]  of what it used to be in the 50s,
[3:29:30.320 --> 3:29:33.320]  in the 1960s,
[3:29:33.320 --> 3:29:36.320]  in the 70s,
[3:29:36.320 --> 3:29:39.320]  the early 90s,
[3:29:39.320 --> 3:29:41.320]  the late 90s.
[3:29:41.320 --> 3:29:43.320]  And here's the picture of the late 90s
[3:29:43.320 --> 3:29:46.320]  down the bottom here on the right.
[3:29:46.320 --> 3:29:51.320]  Look at the stupid little freaky cut zone.
[3:29:51.320 --> 3:29:53.320]  No life scum.
[3:29:53.320 --> 3:29:55.320]  Not a drop of boogie knot.
[3:29:55.320 --> 3:29:57.320]  An ounce of jive.
[3:29:57.320 --> 3:29:59.320]  Tech slums.
[3:29:59.320 --> 3:30:08.320]  And their jeans and their t-shirts.
[3:30:08.320 --> 3:30:11.320]  Look how low this country's gone.
[3:30:11.320 --> 3:30:15.320]  And these are the freaks like that little sucker-burgin.
[3:30:15.320 --> 3:30:18.320]  You'd take that S out or the Z out
[3:30:18.320 --> 3:30:20.320]  and throw in an F.
[3:30:20.320 --> 3:30:23.320]  Look at this clown.
[3:30:23.320 --> 3:30:25.320]  Look at Cook.
[3:30:25.320 --> 3:30:28.320]  Look what we've become.
[3:30:28.320 --> 3:30:30.320]  Best food, high tech.
[3:30:30.320 --> 3:30:33.320]  High tech. No style, no sound,
[3:30:33.320 --> 3:30:35.320]  no vibe, no passion.
[3:30:35.320 --> 3:30:37.320]  Don't need it.
[3:30:37.320 --> 3:30:39.320]  No.
[3:30:39.320 --> 3:30:42.320]  For America to come back,
[3:30:42.320 --> 3:30:45.320]  we need a renaissance.
[3:30:45.320 --> 3:30:48.320]  Because art is the way of finding
[3:30:48.320 --> 3:30:50.320]  the true meaning of the human spirit.
[3:30:50.320 --> 3:30:52.320]  Not your digital crap.
[3:30:52.320 --> 3:30:54.320]  And I don't carry a cell phone.
[3:30:54.320 --> 3:30:57.320]  I got an old flip phone that I take with me
[3:30:57.320 --> 3:30:59.320]  when I used to travel by air,
[3:30:59.320 --> 3:31:02.320]  but won't anymore because I won't hit the facts.
[3:31:02.320 --> 3:31:04.320]  So I tell the quote,
[3:31:04.320 --> 3:31:06.320]  I'm at gate seven, pick me up.
[3:31:06.320 --> 3:31:08.320]  Because I know about radio frequency radiation
[3:31:08.320 --> 3:31:10.320]  and on and on.
[3:31:10.320 --> 3:31:12.320]  But anyway,
[3:31:12.320 --> 3:31:14.320]  they robbed us of our style.
[3:31:14.320 --> 3:31:16.320]  Fast food
[3:31:16.320 --> 3:31:18.320]  and the geeks.
[3:31:18.320 --> 3:31:21.320]  Could you get less stylish
[3:31:21.320 --> 3:31:24.320]  than the geeky freaks?
[3:31:24.320 --> 3:31:28.320]  Hard to do.
[3:31:28.320 --> 3:31:30.320]  A renaissance.
[3:31:30.320 --> 3:31:32.320]  Art is the way of finding the true meaning
[3:31:32.320 --> 3:31:33.320]  of the human spirit.
[3:31:33.320 --> 3:31:34.320]  Oh, by the way,
[3:31:34.320 --> 3:31:36.320]  the renaissance followed the black plague.
[3:31:36.320 --> 3:31:37.320]  That's right.
[3:31:37.320 --> 3:31:39.320]  Say, renaissance follows the
[3:31:39.320 --> 3:31:41.320]  Cold War.
[3:31:41.320 --> 3:32:09.320]  We'll be right back.
[3:32:09.320 --> 3:32:12.320]  This mouthwash only uses the best natural ingredients,
[3:32:12.320 --> 3:32:14.320]  like real peppermint oil,
[3:32:14.320 --> 3:32:15.320]  thyme oil,
[3:32:15.320 --> 3:32:16.320]  xylitol,
[3:32:16.320 --> 3:32:17.320]  and of course,
[3:32:17.320 --> 3:32:19.320]  high quality charcoal.
[3:32:19.320 --> 3:32:21.320]  Not only fluoride free,
[3:32:21.320 --> 3:32:23.320]  this mouthwash is completely free
[3:32:23.320 --> 3:32:25.320]  of other dangerous ingredients such as
[3:32:25.320 --> 3:32:26.320]  SLS,
[3:32:26.320 --> 3:32:28.320]  harsh detergents,
[3:32:28.320 --> 3:32:29.320]  BPA,
[3:32:29.320 --> 3:32:30.320]  and so much more.
[3:32:30.320 --> 3:32:32.320]  As soon as you use it,
[3:32:32.320 --> 3:32:34.320]  you can tell that this formula is the real deal.
[3:32:34.320 --> 3:32:36.320]  So get your bottle of the new
[3:32:36.320 --> 3:32:38.320]  activated charcoal mouthwash
[3:32:38.320 --> 3:32:43.320]  right now at infowarstore.com.
[3:32:43.320 --> 3:32:45.320]  I don't like coming to you
[3:32:45.320 --> 3:32:47.320]  and saying this could be our last broadcast.
[3:32:47.320 --> 3:32:49.320]  Hell, I've been on there 27 years,
[3:32:49.320 --> 3:32:51.320]  and only the last year or so have I said that.
[3:32:51.320 --> 3:32:52.320]  But let me tell you,
[3:32:52.320 --> 3:32:54.320]  the New World Order is breathing down our neck.
[3:32:54.320 --> 3:32:56.320]  The big, globalist publications are coming after us,
[3:32:56.320 --> 3:32:58.320]  and they're doing everything they can to shut us down.
[3:32:58.320 --> 3:33:01.320]  So please pray to keep Infowars on the air,
[3:33:01.320 --> 3:33:03.320]  and please support the local states
[3:33:03.320 --> 3:33:04.320]  you're listening to as well.
[3:33:04.320 --> 3:33:05.320]  At the same time,
[3:33:05.320 --> 3:33:07.320]  go to infowarstore.com
[3:33:07.320 --> 3:33:08.320]  while you still can,
[3:33:08.320 --> 3:33:09.320]  and get a book,
[3:33:09.320 --> 3:33:10.320]  get a film,
[3:33:10.320 --> 3:33:11.320]  get a t-shirt,
[3:33:11.320 --> 3:33:12.320]  get some supplements
[3:33:12.320 --> 3:33:13.320]  because it's that money
[3:33:13.320 --> 3:33:15.320]  that helps us stay on air
[3:33:15.320 --> 3:33:16.320]  in the face of this thing.
[3:33:16.320 --> 3:33:18.320]  I need your help more than ever now.
[3:33:18.320 --> 3:33:20.320]  I want to keep fighting the globalists,
[3:33:20.320 --> 3:33:23.320]  but I can't do it if you don't support us.
[3:33:23.320 --> 3:33:24.320]  So pray for us,
[3:33:24.320 --> 3:33:25.320]  word of mouth,
[3:33:25.320 --> 3:33:27.320]  tell folks about the broadcast however you can,
[3:33:27.320 --> 3:33:29.320]  and buy great products that will enrich you
[3:33:29.320 --> 3:33:31.320]  and your family's lives
[3:33:31.320 --> 3:33:33.320]  every day at infowarstore.com.
[3:33:33.320 --> 3:33:35.320]  Whether it's high quality coffee for supplements
[3:33:35.320 --> 3:33:37.320]  or books or films,
[3:33:37.320 --> 3:33:39.320]  all of it nurtures the soul,
[3:33:39.320 --> 3:33:41.320]  all of it empowers humanity,
