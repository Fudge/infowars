[00:00.000 --> 00:12.040]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[00:12.040 --> 00:20.800]  he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin, Texas Alex Jones
[00:20.800 --> 00:30.400]  all over the United States
[00:33.400 --> 00:38.600]  the federal government is lobbying the stage to pass bills that remove the
[00:38.600 --> 00:44.880]  Fourth Amendment completely from children that remove habeas corpus from
[00:44.880 --> 00:49.160]  the families where the eugenics courts known as the family courts will seize
[00:49.160 --> 00:53.720]  your children and not even tell you that they've grabbed them medical records
[00:53.720 --> 00:57.880]  will be wide open to them they can grab your children from school and not even
[00:57.880 --> 01:03.440]  tell you that they have them for days without a court order without a subpoena
[01:03.440 --> 01:11.440]  without a grand jury SB 1440 is on the governor's desk and governor Perry
[01:11.440 --> 01:17.960]  right now is expected to sign the bill there is no end to the criminality of
[01:17.960 --> 01:21.960]  government there's also federal bills very similar to this right now so that's
[01:21.960 --> 01:27.800]  coming up for 30 minutes in the third hour today two of the lawyers fighting
[01:27.800 --> 01:31.960]  this last week we're gonna have them live from the press conference but we had a
[01:31.960 --> 01:39.800]  bizarre power outage and after 30 minutes our backup batteries started
[01:39.800 --> 01:45.040]  failing so we had the network go to rebroadcast from Minnesota so we're
[01:45.040 --> 01:51.720]  gonna try to redo this today with these two lawyers on the air with us and then
[01:51.720 --> 01:55.240]  in studio because I ran out of time with them I want to have Gary Franchi of
[01:55.240 --> 01:59.040]  Lone Lantern Society and restore the Republic and William Lewis filmmaker
[01:59.040 --> 02:03.000]  together in studio we had Lewis here but mainly I'm gonna have Franchi today
[02:03.000 --> 02:05.360]  because they're doing part two of an interview with me we ran out of time
[02:05.360 --> 02:09.600]  yesterday because I had so much going on in the office to finish the interview
[02:09.600 --> 02:16.680]  for a film they're making about concentration camps so that is coming
[02:16.680 --> 02:21.000]  up today as well we are going to have open phones throughout the broadcast at
[02:21.000 --> 02:31.040]  1-800-259-9231 1-800-2599-231 because I know you want to chime in on all the
[02:31.040 --> 02:35.400]  earth shaking events that are happening across the planet in fact I'm gonna start
[02:35.400 --> 02:41.240]  getting into some of those headlines right now every couple weeks there's a
[02:41.240 --> 02:48.120]  story that's so big so huge so important that I don't want to just come on
[02:48.120 --> 02:53.880]  air and start covering the story I want to build up to it with a drum roll
[02:53.880 --> 02:59.720]  because that's the only way we can get the audience to really focus in on what's
[02:59.720 --> 03:05.720]  happening my self included incredible off-the-charge things are happening
[03:05.720 --> 03:12.220]  every day now and I catch my shelf not even caring or not even making a big
[03:12.220 --> 03:17.120]  deal out of it myself because I've been covering it and focusing on it and
[03:17.120 --> 03:21.720]  knowing all of this was coming for so long that I myself have become
[03:21.720 --> 03:27.000]  acclimated we must psychologically get control of our thought processes and
[03:27.000 --> 03:33.620]  realize that you know let's say you're chained down to a railroad tracks and you
[03:33.620 --> 03:38.720]  know a train is coming sooner or later to run you over and then off in the
[03:38.720 --> 03:42.600]  distance you hear its horn blowing and it's five miles away it's three miles
[03:42.600 --> 03:46.320]  away it's two miles away it's a mile away now you're looking at it coming down
[03:46.320 --> 03:51.840]  the track at high speed and many of these trains have already hit our free
[03:51.840 --> 03:56.520]  societies they've already been run over repeatedly by all different types of
[03:56.520 --> 04:01.760]  corruption and tyranny and despotism but now the big kahuna the open
[04:01.760 --> 04:10.880]  establishment of world government is openly no debate on record in your
[04:10.880 --> 04:16.960]  face in the establishment's own words admitted and they're now confirming
[04:16.960 --> 04:20.520]  everything we warned you about all these years exactly what life in the New
[04:20.520 --> 04:27.960]  World Order is going to be like so I'm gonna take calls to the bottom of this
[04:27.960 --> 04:32.200]  hour and then I'm gonna get into this and I ask you to call everybody you know

[07:03.160 --> 07:07.240]  affiliate radio stations he got laid off from a job he loved many years ago he
[07:07.240 --> 07:10.880]  was devastated but it taught him a lesson very early in life that even when
[07:10.880 --> 07:14.440]  you do a great job for someone and your boss tells you how much he appreciates
[07:14.440 --> 07:18.600]  you every day there is no job security you are always in danger of losing your
[07:18.600 --> 07:22.720]  job unless you take charge of your livelihood and own your own business
[07:22.720 --> 07:27.920]  since you are the boss nobody can fire you so MZ has been his own boss for over
[07:27.920 --> 07:32.640]  37 years and he is passionate about turning other people on to the joys and
[07:32.640 --> 07:37.080]  benefits of working for themselves and not for others MZ wants to tell you
[07:37.080 --> 07:40.600]  about a low-cost home business opportunity involving the marketing of

[07:59.640 --> 08:05.280]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones show
[08:05.280 --> 08:09.920]  because there's a war on for your mind
[08:09.920 --> 08:37.080]  The so-called government is nothing but a extraction device for private interest to
[08:37.080 --> 08:41.800]  steal money from the general public monopoly capitalist fund communist
[08:41.800 --> 08:47.520]  socialist fascist dictators of every stripe religious dictators they don't
[08:47.520 --> 08:52.480]  care as Carol Quigley at Georgetown writing for the State Department in
[08:52.480 --> 08:57.920]  their official history of how they operate tragedy and hope it's all a big
[08:57.920 --> 09:05.640]  sickening macabre sadomasochistic cold-blooded predatory joke and that's
[09:05.640 --> 09:10.240]  how they operate and that's what the government's there for it's there to
[09:10.240 --> 09:14.240]  kidnap your children it's there to shoot you up with cancer viruses it's there
[09:14.240 --> 09:18.040]  to put poisonous drugs on the market it's there to put mercury in the baby's
[09:18.040 --> 09:23.040]  milk formula it's there to put melamine in the milk it's there to put mercury in
[09:23.040 --> 09:28.080]  your corn syrup it's there to kill you dead in a hammer it's there to suck
[09:28.080 --> 09:33.200]  everything it can off you dummy it down and shove the end of a cremation
[09:33.200 --> 09:40.400]  facility and if people can't figure out that psychopathic cold-blooded pieces
[09:40.400 --> 09:45.720]  of filth run the planet like they have all throughout history good people have
[09:45.720 --> 09:49.800]  been in control very seldom and that that's where we see the great leaps in
[09:49.800 --> 09:55.400]  society and civilization are those blinks of an eye when half decent people
[09:55.400 --> 10:01.280]  get in control everything else is stagnation and corruption like Mexico or
[10:01.280 --> 10:06.040]  North Korea that's how the world works what you see in Mexico and what you see
[10:06.040 --> 10:12.800]  in North Korea that's how the planets always worked and we better recognize it
[10:12.800 --> 10:18.000]  right now because the British royalty the Rothschilds and others got together
[10:18.000 --> 10:24.360]  over a hundred years ago on record and said empires and elites always implode
[10:24.360 --> 10:28.560]  because of their own corruption how do we keep our own servants in line how do
[10:28.560 --> 10:34.880]  we dumb the public down so they can't resist us ever so that it would be as
[10:34.880 --> 10:40.520]  impossible as cows out on a pasture revolting against their owners and the
[10:40.520 --> 10:47.560]  practice of eating beef that's one of the ways they describe it or it would be
[10:47.560 --> 10:52.680]  as impossible for the proletariat to revolt as sheep revolting against the
[10:52.680 --> 11:01.080]  practice of eating mutton and I repeat that a lot on the show because that's
[11:01.080 --> 11:06.000]  their mindset that's their idea that's what they say over and over again they
[11:06.000 --> 11:11.880]  are scientifically been studying psychology hormones our minds
[11:11.880 --> 11:18.840]  anthropology sociology folklore archetypes to scientifically devastate
[11:18.840 --> 11:26.680]  societies to scientifically turn men into sophomoric weak gibbering twits to
[11:26.680 --> 11:35.880]  turn women into mindless shallow insecure whores to get everybody in debt and to
[11:35.880 --> 11:39.760]  totally incinerate society and destroy the family and they have done an
[11:39.760 --> 11:45.960]  absolutely fabulous job and are now engaging in mop up operations and let
[11:45.960 --> 11:49.280]  me explain something when they're done with mop up operations they're going to
[11:49.280 --> 11:53.920]  start going with hot kill weapons they're not going to just be running with
[11:53.920 --> 11:57.280]  soft kills that they've been incrementally testing on us all their
[11:57.280 --> 12:07.680]  devastation depending on what index one in fifty two with cancer now today one
[12:07.680 --> 12:12.120]  in three some indexes one in thirty three dying of cancer now one in two to
[12:12.120 --> 12:19.200]  one in three all the explosions of every disease under the sun all timers when
[12:19.200 --> 12:27.240]  you're 25 all of it is just soft kill weapon test and let me tell you
[12:27.240 --> 12:31.600]  something they're gonna keep rationing it up till people are dying all around
[12:31.600 --> 12:35.760]  you till your family's dying till half your family's in wheelchairs and they're
[12:35.760 --> 12:39.040]  gonna tell you it's normal that half your family's in wheelchairs it isn't
[12:39.040 --> 12:43.000]  normal ladies and gentlemen it didn't normal to have kids dying of cancer on
[12:43.000 --> 12:53.200]  every street in America and it didn't run of the mill pollution in 1920s in
[12:53.200 --> 12:56.880]  London one of the most polluted cities in the world with lead and mercury running
[12:56.880 --> 13:03.000]  down the streets toxic fumes out of the factories falling on the cities they
[13:03.000 --> 13:08.520]  didn't have one tenth of the disease they have today of the types of diseases
[13:08.520 --> 13:13.920]  we're seeing crop up and the types of illnesses so I don't know how to say it
[13:13.920 --> 13:18.240]  to you anymore out there but I'm gonna I'm gonna break it down coming up later
[13:18.240 --> 13:24.320]  in the hour huge news and Paul Watson's got an excellent headline on this but it
[13:24.320 --> 13:31.840]  still doesn't give it the proper import the the the proper magnitude even though
[13:31.840 --> 13:39.600]  it's the headline I gave him to write maybe Kurt Nemo can take the same story
[13:39.600 --> 13:44.400]  and give it a different headline so it's got a different spin to it so maybe it
[13:44.400 --> 13:52.040]  wakes people up Obama regulatory reform plan officially establishes banking
[13:52.040 --> 13:57.280]  dictatorship in the United States and that's absolutely true but the Bank of
[13:57.280 --> 14:01.720]  England the banks in Europe the banks in Japan are all owned by the same people
[14:01.720 --> 14:06.120]  and they're all announcing new powers for the Bank of England new powers for the
[14:06.120 --> 14:10.520]  Bank of Japan new powers for the Bundesbank new powers and it's all for
[14:10.520 --> 14:17.480]  the International Bank of Settlements IMF World Bank openly announcing the new
[14:17.480 --> 14:20.520]  bank of the world you'll pay your taxes to and I know I've talked about this for
[14:20.520 --> 14:24.680]  years and we've made films about it it's in the Obama deception but it's really
[14:24.680 --> 14:33.760]  happening now and the AP and Reuters and the rest of them report on the quote
[14:33.760 --> 14:41.600]  banking reform bill and say oh the scope of the banking reform bill has summoned
[14:41.600 --> 14:49.840]  Congress concerned that it might not do enough see their spin is oh this might
[14:49.840 --> 14:54.640]  not be enough total absolute dictatorship so see they put out fake
[14:54.640 --> 14:58.240]  criticism to make it look like they're criticizing it but then saying it isn't
[14:58.240 --> 15:02.680]  enough so somebody reads that and thinks oh it isn't enough talk about deception
[15:02.680 --> 15:05.520]  within deception
[15:06.600 --> 15:09.760]  ladies and gentlemen I for years I've told you it's we're gonna end up with a
[15:09.760 --> 15:14.080]  open-world government run by private interest and this is it see what they do
[15:14.080 --> 15:21.360]  is they build continuity of government national security control grids under the
[15:21.360 --> 15:25.480]  guise of fighting terrorism and environmental crises and crime they
[15:25.480 --> 15:31.240]  remove the Parliament's and Congress's power all power is vested in the shadow
[15:31.240 --> 15:36.800]  government now out in the open and then the bankers openly passed legislation
[15:36.800 --> 15:44.160]  linking that under their command open complete dictatorship of private banks
[15:44.160 --> 15:47.320]  over the planet but I'm gonna break this down and what life under them will be
[15:47.320 --> 15:54.800]  like coming up after calls and then how that dovetails with articles like this
[15:54.800 --> 15:58.080]  one I see every day in the news and billboards and TV ads about how cash is
[15:58.080 --> 16:02.960]  dirty cash is dangerous cash is criminal and if you call being able to live
[16:02.960 --> 16:06.080]  your life and been able to work in the underground economy and survive when
[16:06.080 --> 16:08.680]  they're planning to set up a world economy where you will have to be on
[16:08.680 --> 16:13.520]  government welfare under their control for eugenics operations so they can have
[16:13.520 --> 16:18.600]  their way with you with the bureaucrat class that's gonna be it see folks with
[16:18.600 --> 16:24.280]  automation and robotics they can produce the cars and houses and bobbles and
[16:24.280 --> 16:28.000]  toys and entertainment for everybody and then once everybody's got that and
[16:28.000 --> 16:34.800]  a little compact control grid cities the only jobs for humans is going to be
[16:34.800 --> 16:40.120]  minding other humans social work environmental assessments audits of
[16:40.120 --> 16:44.520]  your home everything you do categorize and track they're on record saying it
[16:44.520 --> 16:49.600]  and they're building it and that's the new economy because the globalists have
[16:49.600 --> 16:53.320]  said in their white papers that we've repeated and covered at nauseam here we
[16:53.320 --> 16:57.360]  cover an end game that they don't want us anymore they don't want large
[16:57.360 --> 17:02.960]  populations anymore and that they don't need us for manual labor anymore that we
[17:02.960 --> 17:09.280]  aren't just a cheap commodity now life is cheap as they say now it's a
[17:09.280 --> 17:14.880]  liability now it's a negative asset to the elite and so they're gonna convert
[17:14.880 --> 17:22.440]  where the only jobs available in the architecture of the economy is police and
[17:22.440 --> 17:27.840]  spies and government minders and tattletale squads and data analysts
[17:27.840 --> 17:32.720]  over the data this is all been set up the majority of the college graduates
[17:32.720 --> 17:38.720]  now isn't doctors or even lawyers or mechanics or electrical engineers or
[17:38.720 --> 17:44.120]  computer programmers it is bureaucrats and minders and spies and Patriot Act
[17:44.120 --> 17:52.720]  compliance as the whole economy is converted where it's the only job you'll
[17:52.720 --> 18:04.200]  be able to have in an engineered monopoly capitalism system and the
[18:04.200 --> 18:10.280]  bureaucrats are gonna be people with the yuppie scum who love lording over
[18:10.280 --> 18:13.320]  people love being arrogant love being on power groups all they care about is that
[18:13.320 --> 18:17.080]  they get to have sex and drink and go skiing and play golf and they're gonna
[18:17.080 --> 18:21.200]  rule over us with an iron fist and they're gonna dispatched the dumb down

[24:43.920 --> 24:49.320]  probably both sides cheating but it is confirmed the US media and the BBC are

[25:12.320 --> 25:21.740]  Andy Rachel MJ Martino's in Europe he just hung up Russell in Texas and others
[25:21.740 --> 25:27.640]  Chris in Canada you're on the air welcome hey what's up Alex hey buddy yeah
[25:27.640 --> 25:32.000]  so I'm a senior in high school right now and I've been listening to you for about
[25:32.000 --> 25:37.400]  two years now and now that I've been listening to you I just see all the
[25:37.400 --> 25:42.760]  mind control is going on in schools and it's only have regular army patrolling
[25:42.760 --> 25:47.360]  the citizens in Canada now quote stopping drunk drivers same as here in the
[25:47.360 --> 25:52.360]  US yeah all incrementally going under martial law yeah like actually what you
[25:52.360 --> 25:55.320]  say about the military thing I was actually driving a couple of weeks ago
[25:55.320 --> 26:00.160]  and I got I got stopped with me in a buddy of mine and we got questioned by
[26:00.160 --> 26:03.600]  the cops so we had like guns pointed out saying like have you been drinking and
[26:03.600 --> 26:07.160]  everything like that it was actually pretty ridiculous well you got a point
[26:07.160 --> 26:10.560]  guns at slaves you got up there they're there to teach us that we're little
[26:10.560 --> 26:15.520]  people their gods the bankers own us and and we're being taught to have broke
[26:15.520 --> 26:19.200]  backs we're being taught to be subservient we're being taught that
[26:19.200 --> 26:25.920]  we're not free men this is all part of bondage also and you yesterday talked
[26:25.920 --> 26:31.320]  about again about the vaccinations right and in my school and also I also have a
[26:31.320 --> 26:34.720]  little brother who's in elementary school both of us are we being like
[26:34.720 --> 26:38.880]  required to take vaccinations and I refuse to take it and they suspended me
[26:38.880 --> 26:44.520]  from school for a week you know that's all a lie same in Canada and in England
[26:44.520 --> 26:50.360]  by law when it's the same in Canada and all your states they have a waiver form
[26:50.360 --> 26:55.280]  understand it's a school policies like saying we have a policy you can't chew
[26:55.280 --> 26:59.880]  gum so if you chew gum you can get suspended or expelled if you do it
[26:59.880 --> 27:05.400]  repeatedly or we have a policy against having cell phones there's no law you
[27:05.400 --> 27:09.360]  can't have a cell phone but they can have a policy and so they have a state
[27:09.360 --> 27:14.100]  policy and a school district policy because it's the same all over the
[27:14.100 --> 27:18.680]  western world where they run their fraud and then they fraudulently suspend
[27:18.680 --> 27:24.440]  you then they trigger criminal truancy when they're the ones that suspended you
[27:24.440 --> 27:28.200]  so that's been found to be fraudulent court most people don't know so the
[27:28.200 --> 27:32.520]  people Paris for lack of knowledge the people die for lack of knowledge as
[27:32.520 --> 27:37.240]  Christ said so you have to understand that they have by law a waiver form to
[27:37.240 --> 27:44.000]  the regulation and so I would try to get complaints filed on them for
[27:44.000 --> 27:49.120]  falsely expelling you or suspending you when they knew there was a waiver form
[27:49.120 --> 27:53.880]  did you submit and take the IQ reduction cancer virus injection well no
[27:53.880 --> 27:57.480]  what happened was they tried they tried to give it to me and what happened was I
[27:57.480 --> 28:00.840]  my parents said you can do whatever you want I was like I'm not taking that
[28:00.840 --> 28:04.840]  because ever since it's completely normal to have the government trying to
[28:04.840 --> 28:08.680]  enforce injections sounds like freedom so tell me what happened thought
[28:08.680 --> 28:13.680]  criminal okay so I told my parents went in there like you can't just spend my
[28:13.680 --> 28:18.280]  time for this it's his choice well well and then we ended up like taking the
[28:18.280 --> 28:22.040]  school and like getting like the government and everything else involved
[28:22.040 --> 28:25.480]  and they finally like we are causing such kind of a problem that they said
[28:25.480 --> 28:28.800]  fine you don't have to take it but then they told my parents that oh your son's
[28:28.800 --> 28:32.520]  gonna be a huge risk of like and it listed off probably like which is total
[28:32.520 --> 28:37.560]  bull if all the other slaves have taken their chemical lobotomy and their cancer
[28:37.560 --> 28:41.840]  virus implantation program that'll wait to replicate once the hormone levels
[28:41.840 --> 28:47.720]  decrease when you begin to outlive your usefulness triggered at age 55 on average
[28:47.720 --> 28:54.680]  I mean it because you wouldn't take the DNA RNA excuse me implantation oh you're
[28:54.680 --> 28:58.760]  gonna hurt the other kids but if they've taken the IQ reduction cancer virus
[28:58.760 --> 29:03.600]  injection they're supposedly protected so if they've taken their eugenics shots
[29:03.600 --> 29:07.120]  and they're so good how are you endangering them if they've taken it
[29:07.120 --> 29:11.960]  that's it's just what I don't understand and also another thing about what
[29:11.960 --> 29:15.640]  they're just mindless idiots who who all want to die young of cancer and serve
[29:15.640 --> 29:19.440]  the New World Order and they may wake up later after most of their family dies
[29:19.440 --> 29:24.480]  the issue here for you to understand is they're just compartmentalized fools you
[29:24.480 --> 29:28.040]  have done well and protected yourself yeah though they're gonna release
[29:28.040 --> 29:32.040]  controlled bio weapons and say you died because you didn't take the vaccines but
[29:32.040 --> 29:35.200]  it's six one way half a dozen another anything else sir
[29:35.200 --> 29:40.120]  and yeah also another thing was I tried to show like convince people watch you
[29:40.120 --> 29:43.840]  vomit deception I put up posters everywhere throughout the school and they
[29:43.840 --> 29:47.920]  got mad at me let me hear about your what you did that in the present you're

[33:35.080 --> 33:40.520]  obama and they said no and my idea was hang up signs supporting him and I
[33:40.520 --> 33:43.760]  bet they'll give you a medal and maybe even let you be part of the youth
[33:43.760 --> 33:48.080]  brigades as the new work times reported yesterday they're hiring felons to make
[33:48.080 --> 33:53.680]  up his new green core but to go ahead chris you're an evil thought criminal in
[33:53.680 --> 33:57.840]  a government training camp in your last year of primary brainwashing go ahead
[33:57.840 --> 34:02.720]  that's what makes me feel right but anyways um so I put them up and they
[34:02.720 --> 34:06.120]  got all mad at me and we're like you can't be doing this ball brawn I said
[34:06.120 --> 34:09.200]  well it's my freedom of speech what happened to that and they're telling me
[34:09.200 --> 34:12.760]  that oh that's not freedom of speech that's big and then like they're just
[34:12.760 --> 34:17.560]  calling me all these just unnecessary names and then what happened was we had
[34:17.560 --> 34:22.440]  uh like it was like a speech contest or a school and so I thought I was not
[34:22.440 --> 34:25.720]  entering it to win like the speech contest or anything I did it so I could
[34:25.720 --> 34:28.760]  get the word out about what is literally going on in the world about the new
[34:28.760 --> 34:32.560]  world order because it was to the whole entire school body so what happens is I
[34:32.560 --> 34:37.360]  got like slides and pictures and a bunch of information I read it and what
[34:37.360 --> 34:41.560]  happened was about halfway through my presentation they took me off stage and
[34:41.560 --> 34:45.160]  told me and we're yelling at me told me I wasn't allowed to be talking about this
[34:45.160 --> 34:49.000]  and then what happens is they called the police on me and they sat and I sat in
[34:49.000 --> 34:52.560]  the office and they pretty much called me a terrorist for about two hours and
[34:52.560 --> 34:55.320]  said that if you keep doing this you're never going to be allowed to leave your
[34:55.320 --> 34:58.800]  house the country whatever like that and they were considering me a terrorist
[34:58.800 --> 35:04.080]  because I wanted to talk about how I felt well you know what I believe you
[35:04.080 --> 35:08.120]  because we've seen this in other cases I've seen Americans in the newspaper
[35:08.120 --> 35:12.520]  arrested for giving police my videos and Ron Paul videos Kelly rushing
[35:12.520 --> 35:16.820]  lion County Kentucky and many other cases but that's one of the more famous
[35:16.820 --> 35:22.120]  ones and what government training camp do you go to
[35:22.120 --> 35:30.560]  Chris it's my school yes it's no it's called Notre Dame Catholic school and
[35:30.560 --> 35:34.040]  is it a private school or government training camp school feels like a
[35:34.040 --> 35:38.560]  government training camp school but is it public or private or it's not like
[35:38.560 --> 35:42.200]  you can you have like you have two different schools you have like the
[35:42.200 --> 35:45.400]  public schools and then you have Catholic it's not really private kind of like
[35:45.400 --> 35:48.500]  if your parents or Catholic or whatever you just end up going to that school no
[35:48.500 --> 35:51.960]  I understand it it's a government funded in fact the Catholic schools and others
[35:51.960 --> 35:58.800]  got caught in Canada literally exterminating the foster children
[35:58.800 --> 36:03.400]  Native Americans and that's been in the big papers up there so I'm aware of
[36:03.400 --> 36:07.760]  your school system and so they told you that you're basically a terrorist we're
[36:07.760 --> 36:11.280]  trying to talk about the New World Order they told me that I was a terrorist
[36:11.280 --> 36:15.640]  and that terrorist go against the government I was like because I was
[36:15.640 --> 36:19.920]  pretty much talking about the US government to be honest and it's all
[36:19.920 --> 36:23.200]  the same thing your government I got you know what you should write an article
[36:23.200 --> 36:28.640]  about it name names okay and so we can call and and vet that you're a student
[36:28.640 --> 36:32.160]  there and things that you're right to write an article as a senior and you
[36:32.160 --> 36:36.400]  need to make a big stink out of this and headline I could imagine student you
[36:36.400 --> 36:41.160]  know speech cut off detained told he was a terrorist for giving a speech send it

[36:45.880 --> 36:51.200]  we'll post it thank you so much good to hear from me Chris by the way I read
[36:51.200 --> 36:56.520]  the prison planet dot com article that linked to mainstream news stories and
[36:56.520 --> 37:03.080]  a press release by the ACLU this really happened and it states that all
[37:03.080 --> 37:09.280]  protest are an act of terrorism they teach the military like that's in my
[37:09.280 --> 37:16.240]  stack but print me that again guys please prison planet dot com all protest
[37:16.240 --> 37:20.160]  terrorism and they teach them they have the training manuals this isn't even
[37:20.160 --> 37:23.440]  hidden they're proud of it and the army goes out and watches Ron Paul when he
[37:23.440 --> 37:27.280]  gives speeches and that's positively normal in Congress isn't allowed to see
[37:27.280 --> 37:33.520]  PDD 51 it's a completely illegitimate rogue criminal government working for
[37:33.520 --> 37:38.120]  offshore banks that have seized the nation period Andy in New Jersey Andy
[37:38.120 --> 37:42.920]  you're on the air that's good to talk to you Alex hello I I just want to
[37:42.920 --> 37:49.120]  confirm a couple of two quick comments to affirm your accuracy here and then one
[37:49.120 --> 37:55.680]  quick question here in New Jersey child protective services confiscated two
[37:55.680 --> 38:02.280]  children all because they didn't like their names which I have to agree what
[38:02.280 --> 38:05.600]  would make it difficult as a child growing up but they were Aryan nation
[38:05.600 --> 38:09.640]  names like the one kid was named at all Hitler and the other one was Jocelyn
[38:09.640 --> 38:14.400]  Aryan yeah I saw that and it's persecution of a group for their
[38:14.400 --> 38:18.080]  thoughts and it's a thought crime and they have bills introduced like cyber
[38:18.080 --> 38:22.320]  bullying looks like it may pass that openly federal felonies if the
[38:22.320 --> 38:26.720]  government says what you're saying could hurt someone's feelings and I've seen
[38:26.720 --> 38:32.480]  other they're now saying raising your voice to a child they will take them and
[38:32.480 --> 38:36.040]  of course they're seven times I keep saying five that was old numbers seven
[38:36.040 --> 38:39.840]  times more likely to abuse your children in their hands they are the most abusive
[38:39.840 --> 38:44.800]  most degenerate people on average is the government pedophiles and this is I
[38:44.800 --> 38:48.940]  mean you are so accurate and you know I thought you were far out there but the
[38:48.940 --> 38:53.120]  more I see and the more you open up my eyes I'm saying to myself I gotta I got
[38:53.120 --> 38:56.520]  a tune out mainstream media and listen to this guy Alex Jones because they're
[38:56.520 --> 39:00.840]  openly saying sir that all gun owners of the number one threat to homeland
[39:00.840 --> 39:05.640]  security North com Army Times says they are prepared to quote have a shooting
[39:05.640 --> 39:09.600]  war with the American people the John Warren Defense Authorization Act says
[39:09.600 --> 39:14.720]  homeland security's main goal is taken over the states it's rogue on record
[39:14.720 --> 39:20.040]  hijacked by offshore banks period and now they're about to pass a bill making
[39:20.040 --> 39:24.360]  offshore banks the government go ahead oh well listen to this and you had said
[39:24.360 --> 39:28.800]  this earlier in your show and I had a while back and I had to confirm this
[39:28.800 --> 39:35.280]  you know Michael Savage he for the first time mentioned the three big words new
[39:35.280 --> 39:39.400]  world order when you had said he would never say anything like that he's a
[39:39.400 --> 39:43.320]  afraid to admit it I heard and this was going back a few weeks he finally
[39:43.320 --> 39:51.400]  mentioned new world order and on top of that I saw your name proudly displayed
[39:51.400 --> 39:54.880]  or and one of his advertisement things there I don't know if you're advertising
[39:54.880 --> 40:00.520]  with him or something but there was your name in there on his web page and he
[40:00.520 --> 40:04.920]  was endorsing you in some way so I think even Michael Savage is starting to
[40:04.920 --> 40:09.040]  regard you with me the great people there sure well what happened is Ted
[40:09.040 --> 40:17.120]  Anderson decided to advertise through an ad agency the Obama deception so Ted
[40:17.120 --> 40:23.160]  Anderson is selling the Obama deception and he ran ads on Limbaugh didn't get a
[40:23.160 --> 40:28.120]  good response ran ads on a bunch on on a bunch of Hannity and stuff didn't get a
[40:28.120 --> 40:36.240]  good response he gets a good response on Savage and Laura Ingram of all places
[40:36.240 --> 40:40.320]  didn't get a good response on Glenn Beck so we've gone out and tested the market
[40:40.320 --> 40:45.720]  and no look I defended Savage when they said he was a thought criminal and not
[40:45.720 --> 40:48.960]  allowed to travel under EU rules to Europe or England it wasn't just England
[40:48.960 --> 40:53.400]  it got focused on England because she made statements about him they now
[40:53.400 --> 40:58.880]  disgraced for stealing money Jackie Smith of the criminal over there in
[40:58.880 --> 41:04.320]  England running the police state but I so I do support Savage his first
[41:04.320 --> 41:08.080]  amendment I don't support Savage when he would say five years ago if you
[41:08.080 --> 41:11.200]  disagree with the war you're aiding Al Qaeda need to be arrested
[41:11.200 --> 41:15.640]  Sedition Act but I think he's now getting his own message his own medicine
[41:15.640 --> 41:20.440]  and may it be changing his tune but no we we Ted Anderson did target Michael
[41:20.440 --> 41:23.560]  Savage his audience with the Obama deception so that's what you're witnessing
[41:23.560 --> 41:28.320]  final question Alex and I was wondering of nobody can probably handle this more
[41:28.320 --> 41:33.880]  than you can is it possible you can do a segment or any research on the
[41:33.880 --> 41:37.920]  authenticity or the birth certificate as to whether or not Obama is actually a
[41:37.920 --> 41:42.480]  US citizen here I believe he was born in Africa and the way they've covered it up
[41:42.480 --> 41:46.400]  and behaved and what his grandmother said and the way he doesn't help any of
[41:46.400 --> 41:51.400]  his family and the rest of it that he was born in Africa and his dad on record
[41:51.400 --> 41:58.480]  was a communist Muslim well in that an oxymoron very very rare and he's really
[41:58.480 --> 42:04.240]  an Arab nothing wrong with that it's just that he's 6% black and so he's
[42:04.240 --> 42:08.720]  he's really Anglo-Saxon Arab we have our first Arab president but he's just a
[42:08.720 --> 42:14.000]  total puppet and everything about him it is a lie so everything you know it's
[42:14.000 --> 42:19.360]  just all complete fraud so if that's the case then what does this mean for the
[42:19.360 --> 42:23.800]  legislation and the law studies bring in and if he's not look at this point he's
[42:23.800 --> 42:29.240]  just a big distraction oh look at the brown president for everybody you know
[42:29.240 --> 42:36.080]  it's a big political diversion sir they are openly openly giving this is even
[42:36.080 --> 42:40.080]  worse than I thought I I appreciate your call I'm gonna have to get into this when
[42:40.080 --> 42:43.760]  I get into it but but the issue is I'm just gonna start at the start of the next
[42:43.760 --> 42:48.440]  hour I won't keep taking calls here they are openly setting up a bank of the
[42:48.440 --> 42:51.720]  world you'll pay your carbon taxes to it's gonna run interest rates it's gonna
[42:51.720 --> 42:58.160]  set currency rates and I thought that was it this is worse than I thought which
[42:58.160 --> 43:01.760]  is more often than not that's what it is see I just know what they're doing
[43:01.760 --> 43:06.280]  people hear this and can't believe it folks I it's worse than I'm saying they
[43:06.280 --> 43:09.680]  really are injecting you with cancer viruses they've been caught thousands of
[43:09.680 --> 43:19.640]  times they really are carrying out eugenics but this bill in Congress being
[43:19.640 --> 43:23.560]  pushed by the White House and it's set to pass in the next few months openly
[43:23.560 --> 43:30.440]  makes the private banks the government I mean I it's even worse than I I can't
[43:30.440 --> 43:35.120]  believe it I just can't believe it it's so incredible to be living with the
[43:35.120 --> 43:40.120]  world government being set up in front of us and I'm listed in manuals as a
[43:40.120 --> 43:45.320]  terrorist and I've got the army spying on me and I'm even sent to the secret
[43:45.320 --> 43:49.680]  documents and the news admit I mean I have the army watching me because I
[43:49.680 --> 43:58.920]  don't want foreign bankers openly were ruling us I mean I can't believe this
[43:58.920 --> 44:02.320]  myself it's so unbelievable I don't blame a lot of people that can't believe
[44:02.320 --> 44:11.480]  this because I can't believe it but it's admitted I mean it's a fact it's total
[44:11.480 --> 44:19.200]  insanity and I can't believe I'm in this position as the biggest voice fighting
[44:19.200 --> 44:25.600]  it isn't it not a position I enjoy by the way I mean I love life as much as
[44:25.600 --> 44:29.560]  the next person probably more but it's because I love life so much that I'm
[44:29.560 --> 44:33.200]  willing to lay mine down to go up against these people I mean I really
[44:33.200 --> 44:36.800]  know how evil they are I know they run giant child kidnapping rings I know they
[44:36.800 --> 44:40.360]  launder the money I know they ship in the drugs I mean these are ruthless
[44:40.360 --> 44:44.040]  people that don't think we have a right to live or any rights they hate our
[44:44.040 --> 44:53.560]  guts let's go ahead and talk to MJ and Texas MJ are on the air hey Alex rate
[44:53.560 --> 45:00.360]  talk to you talk to you MJ Wow well I've been on a journey of waking up this
[45:00.360 --> 45:04.040]  past few months and I gotta tell you the truth is definitely strange that in a
[45:04.040 --> 45:11.880]  lie I've been watching your your documentaries are the Obama deception
[45:11.880 --> 45:18.640]  was absolutely flawless but I've also been reading from John Taylor it's
[45:18.640 --> 45:24.040]  full books about the education public education and you know the compulsory
[45:24.040 --> 45:31.160]  nature of it how can we just you know take back our own minds and really you
[45:31.160 --> 45:34.240]  know get that free spirit in this that's inherent in all of us how can we
[45:34.240 --> 45:40.120]  actually access that well from birth we're put into this grid they put the
[45:40.120 --> 45:44.400]  kids in front of the television as the babysitter they've set up the tax system
[45:44.400 --> 45:48.800]  where mama's got to work on average so she can pay the bills and daddy's got to
[45:48.800 --> 45:54.080]  work so the baby and they can't afford a babysitter so the baby watches TV then
[45:54.080 --> 45:59.000]  on average now they want the kids at three and quote free government day care
[45:59.000 --> 46:03.200]  head start CPS comes in gives you home visits teaches you you're a slave
[46:03.200 --> 46:09.040]  teaches the kid that the government's the mommy and daddy over the parents then
[46:09.040 --> 46:12.880]  they throw the book at the kids you know when in the old days they would have
[46:12.880 --> 46:15.760]  just gotten in trouble and been disciplined now they don't discipline
[46:15.760 --> 46:19.320]  them sociologically knowing it'll mean they get into even more trouble then
[46:19.320 --> 46:21.840]  they institutionalized them end up putting them in the criminal justice
[46:21.840 --> 46:27.040]  system so a large portion almost half the youth end up with criminal records so
[46:27.040 --> 46:30.560]  they never have a second amendment or any rights so they can be further
[46:30.560 --> 46:35.200]  enslaved that's what tyranny does it makes everybody criminals and sets it up
[46:35.200 --> 46:39.640]  to do that the prisons are colleges for crime hence we have the highest one of
[46:39.640 --> 46:43.080]  the highest crime rates in the world most people in prison they ship in the
[46:43.080 --> 46:46.960]  drugs advertising it's cool the kids usually put you in prison we have to
[46:46.960 --> 46:52.880]  fully pull out of Babylon we are in the world but we are not of the world and
[46:52.880 --> 46:56.920]  we have to discipline ourselves against peer pressure to just not be part of
[46:56.920 --> 47:02.680]  any of it and you know all of us stumble and all of us make mistakes and all of
[47:02.680 --> 47:07.480]  us do it but but more and more it's a process of pulling our soul out of
[47:07.480 --> 47:11.240]  Babylon and that's what this is this is Babylon and it traffics in the souls of
[47:11.240 --> 47:15.960]  men they can enslave your body but they can't enslave your soul is there any
[47:15.960 --> 47:22.000]  evidence for a pre-rapser or you know where God's people will be raptured
[47:22.000 --> 47:29.000]  before the you know the apocalypse and everything that's coming well I mean
[47:29.000 --> 47:31.080]  they are coming out with the world government they are coming out with
[47:31.080 --> 47:33.960]  implantable chips that's official they're gonna force people to take them and
[47:33.960 --> 47:37.160]  the atheists are all gonna take it because they're gonna laugh and say you
[47:37.160 --> 47:42.040]  Christians are just cooks most the churches are 501 C3 on FEMA payroll
[47:42.040 --> 47:48.080]  now so they're gonna the Bible says the Antichrist will rise up in Israel and
[47:48.080 --> 47:52.000]  they will fall down and worship him as Christ and look how the churches the new
[47:52.000 --> 47:55.600]  religion is worshiping Israel whether that's good or bad and so when the
[47:55.600 --> 48:00.880]  Antichrist rises they will fall down and think that is the Christ and the Jews
[48:00.880 --> 48:04.200]  are gonna think it's the Messiah if you believe the Bible what it actually says
[48:04.200 --> 48:07.560]  not what the Rockefeller funded churches the last hundred years have taught
[48:07.560 --> 48:14.200]  and then they wage war against the Saints wipe out most the Saints and it's
[48:14.200 --> 48:18.040]  the Antichrist is also gonna hunt down Jews in the end he's an act like he's
[48:18.040 --> 48:23.600]  friends at first and then he's gonna go after him he's gonna wipe out more than
[48:23.600 --> 48:31.840]  a third of the planet's population and that's how this system works you won't
[48:31.840 --> 48:35.600]  be able to grow food anything without his mark and that's the system going in
[48:35.600 --> 48:43.880]  now whether you believe that's true or not this is a news program the elites do
[48:43.880 --> 48:47.760]  worship Lucifer they do believe they're manifesting this but they believe
[48:47.760 --> 48:52.160]  Lucifer is God and that Jesus is the devil and a liar and that they're gonna
[48:52.160 --> 48:55.680]  have this world government and their Messiah is real and that Christ is the
[48:55.680 --> 49:02.280]  imposter or the evil twin brother of Satan Lucifer they believe Jesus is
[49:02.280 --> 49:09.600]  Lucifer and Lucifer is Jesus if you want to get technical into that so very
[49:09.600 --> 49:13.920]  very sick they're manifesting all of this they're following the Bible and
[49:13.920 --> 49:18.640]  there is no pre-tribulation rapture how does the beast wage war on the Saints
[49:18.640 --> 49:24.560]  and overcome them if the Saints are all gone you know did God teleport the
[49:24.560 --> 49:28.240]  Christians out of Nazi Germany or Soviet Russia or Communist China or Fidel's
[49:28.240 --> 49:38.520]  Cuba did God teleport the Christians out of the the Roman arena the circus
[49:38.520 --> 49:42.400]  Maximus when they were being torn limb from limb by lions and tigers and
[49:42.400 --> 49:49.400]  elephants and gladiators no what happened all the disciples killed boiled
[49:49.400 --> 49:55.880]  alive crucified upside down heads chopped off tortured no you've got to have
[49:55.880 --> 49:59.480]  your metal tested that's the way the universe operates and so it's a giant
[49:59.480 --> 50:04.160]  devilish fraud the devil's greatest trick was convincing the world he didn't
[50:04.160 --> 50:07.400]  exist and whether you believe in that entity or not our human psyche
[50:07.400 --> 50:12.280]  manifests this evil and believes it that archetype and the second biggest trick
[50:12.280 --> 50:15.160]  was convincing people that they don't have to go through this and these stupid
[50:15.160 --> 50:19.240]  fake Christians go praise God it's the end of the world I don't have to face
[50:19.240 --> 50:26.200]  any of this and then they're going to accept the great delusion because
[50:26.200 --> 50:31.920]  they're cowards and they're of their father anything else sir yeah I just
[50:31.920 --> 50:36.200]  wanted to ask if there's any I went to the we are change.org site and I

[51:02.640 --> 51:06.480]  beginning to realize the enormity of the economic and political problems facing

[54:55.000 --> 55:01.800]  come hi Alex I just want to talk a little bit about the 9-11 truth movement
[55:01.800 --> 55:07.600]  and I believe you know that y'all doing did right and trying to research out of
[55:07.600 --> 55:12.920]  all of these things about whether the plane hit the building this or that but
[55:12.920 --> 55:17.680]  I think you that y'all are getting like way too off the subject of finding the
[55:17.680 --> 55:23.040]  people that actually did it and putting a name to who did it so we can get rid of
[55:23.040 --> 55:29.160]  them you see you know what I'm talking about it's like too far into we have
[55:29.160 --> 55:33.840]  to understand sir I don't hold on just a minute I don't control anything I don't
[55:33.840 --> 55:39.280]  control 9-11 truth groups and they're all diverse it's just a name nobody
[55:39.280 --> 55:44.720]  controls the name we are change nobody controls saying you're an info warrior
[55:44.720 --> 55:51.280]  or your attorney response team person there there isn't some monolithic head
[55:51.280 --> 55:56.920]  of the 9-11 truth movement there's a fount there's a place it all started
[55:56.920 --> 56:01.960]  myself before 9-11 happened and on day one taking the heat coming on air and
[56:01.960 --> 56:05.920]  saying it was an inside job but when we get architects and engineers and
[56:05.920 --> 56:10.360]  scientists and peer-reviewed journals to show the buildings were blown up that
[56:10.360 --> 56:15.240]  then demands the investigation and when the system says no to the
[56:15.240 --> 56:21.200]  investigation then a lot of people wake up so I think there's been some groups
[56:21.200 --> 56:25.040]  out there that have been very effective in the path they've taken but you are
[56:25.040 --> 56:28.960]  the 9-11 truth movement sir you're welcome to start a website or a radio
[56:28.960 --> 56:34.080]  show or call in here and tell us who you think did it I don't know who did it
[56:34.080 --> 56:39.040]  but I would like to know who did it eventually that way that we can make
[56:39.040 --> 56:43.200]  sure that it never happens again that was just one subject the other subject I
[56:43.200 --> 56:49.920]  have is the sham election that we had with Barack Obama and John McCain they
[56:49.920 --> 56:58.000]  ran Barack Obama ran a campaign based off an empty word of hope and then
[56:58.000 --> 57:05.480]  Sarah Palin and John McCain ran a campaign off Joe the plumber you understand
[57:05.480 --> 57:10.720]  that that's just a mockery of our whole system yes but I mean I tell people over
[57:10.720 --> 57:15.360]  and over again focusing only or predominantly on the presidential
[57:15.360 --> 57:19.440]  elections is a distraction by design the real fights going on in the counties
[57:19.440 --> 57:24.640]  and cities and states and adults everywhere should be involved keeping
[57:24.640 --> 57:29.640]  CPS from kidnapping people's children when somebody else's who's innocent has
[57:29.640 --> 57:36.480]  the government outside judicial systems outside due process stealing people's
[57:36.480 --> 57:42.520]  kids and the government has the track record of abusing the kids then every
[57:42.520 --> 57:46.160]  that's everybody's own issue but we've lost that instinct that when your
[57:46.160 --> 57:50.920]  neighbor is getting persecuted you better get upset like it's happening to you
[57:50.920 --> 57:55.560]  it's called self-preservation people lost their instinct I mean when somebody's
[57:55.560 --> 57:59.440]  stealing somebody's kid I don't even know it's like they're stealing mine it's a
[57:59.440 --> 58:04.560]  very same feeling and it's because I know evil when I see it and I want to
[58:04.560 --> 58:08.360]  route it out we've lost our instinct to go after evil I appreciate your call
[58:08.360 --> 58:13.920]  though sir Mark in Florida since he disagrees we'll come to him in the next
[58:13.920 --> 58:16.720]  segment then at the eight after second segment next hour I'm going to launch
[58:16.720 --> 58:23.480]  into the latest chapter in the globalist takeover of the planet and it just more

[1:00:45.760 --> 1:00:51.920]  mark in Florida you're on the air go ahead hey Alex I think you may have a
[1:00:51.920 --> 1:00:59.320]  blind spot Kevin Trudeau is someone that you need to really watch having further
[1:00:59.320 --> 1:01:08.440]  liaisons with I find you go and you bullhorn the builder burgers and Kevin
[1:01:08.440 --> 1:01:15.720]  Trudeau has dinner with him on their 200 foot yachts and he I think you
[1:01:15.720 --> 1:01:22.560]  need to consider twice and twice any further liaisons you might have because
[1:01:22.560 --> 1:01:26.800]  for all you know he may be out to get you and to get you off the air and then
[1:01:26.800 --> 1:01:31.080]  all the bill of burgers will say well fine Kevin now you can have your if you
[1:01:31.080 --> 1:01:36.040]  allow me to be specific I had had his mega memory and I was like in high school
[1:01:36.040 --> 1:01:40.520]  and then I'd read one of his books the first edition about natural cures and
[1:01:40.520 --> 1:01:44.680]  really thought it was great stuff and that he was being persecuted but since
[1:01:44.680 --> 1:01:50.120]  then I've been mailed his other books where he's saying he was an area of 51
[1:01:50.120 --> 1:01:56.240]  and stuff so yeah and what happened is we actually got contacted by his people
[1:01:56.240 --> 1:01:59.320]  and he wanted to come on the show and I think he has a right to his first
[1:01:59.320 --> 1:02:03.880]  amendment but yeah there's a lot of stuff I disagree with about Kevin Trudeau
[1:02:03.880 --> 1:02:11.040]  and I guess you know I'm just friendly to my guests who were here and he did he
[1:02:11.040 --> 1:02:14.960]  is a listener he listens to podcast every day I was asking questions about the
[1:02:14.960 --> 1:02:19.160]  show did you hear this did did you hear that and so I guess flattery I will get
[1:02:19.160 --> 1:02:25.000]  you somewhere but you know my issue is that Kevin Trudeau isn't running white
[1:02:25.000 --> 1:02:28.200]  slavery rings like Dinecore and Halliburton and when it comes out in
[1:02:28.200 --> 1:02:33.320]  Congress they are Rumsfeld says they're allowed to I mean I have video of this in
[1:02:33.320 --> 1:02:39.360]  testimony so you know my when ABC news and Fox and CNN are saying Kevin Trudeau
[1:02:39.360 --> 1:02:45.640]  is Satan I automatically you know tend to go give me a break but I might have
[1:02:45.640 --> 1:02:49.000]  him back sometime and give him a little bit more of a tough interview and go
[1:02:49.000 --> 1:02:51.960]  and go through some of the stuff I've been sent by listeners now but I
[1:02:51.960 --> 1:02:57.000]  certainly appreciate the the heads up there buddy just be very careful that
[1:02:57.000 --> 1:03:01.280]  all because I want to see on the I want to continue to see on the the waves here
[1:03:01.280 --> 1:03:04.960]  we listen to you every day well I mean look look I mean they're saying all
[1:03:04.960 --> 1:03:08.680]  protest is terrorism now I mean they're not gonna take me off the air because I
[1:03:08.680 --> 1:03:13.600]  had Kevin Trudeau on the radio I don't think I mean see that's tyranny I mean
[1:03:13.600 --> 1:03:16.840]  that's my whole point if they can shut him down they can shut me down that's
[1:03:16.840 --> 1:03:20.480]  why I was saying he has a right because I've read quite a bit of his stuff and
[1:03:20.480 --> 1:03:26.560]  even if he hasn't been to area 51 which I really sounds ridiculous to me he has
[1:03:26.560 --> 1:03:30.480]  a right to write that I mean don't you understand that if we start taking his
[1:03:30.480 --> 1:03:36.200]  free speech we all lose it I don't like the black supremacist saying all whites
[1:03:36.200 --> 1:03:40.120]  are devils and need to die and they need to kill all the babies like Khalid
[1:03:40.120 --> 1:03:44.960]  Muhammad said you kill the white women why did you kill the women because the
[1:03:44.960 --> 1:03:50.560]  white woman is the military manufacturing center that's a quote I love
[1:03:50.560 --> 1:03:54.360]  doing that that quote but the you know I don't blame all black people because of
[1:03:54.360 --> 1:04:00.560]  that and I and I said don't take Khalid Muhammad's voice away because then
[1:04:00.560 --> 1:04:05.080]  they'll take my voice away just like I say don't take David Duke's voice away
[1:04:05.080 --> 1:04:09.440]  or I you know I said don't take what was his name William Pierce's voice away
[1:04:09.440 --> 1:04:13.520]  they tried to do that you know I don't take mech and la raza saying they're a
[1:04:13.520 --> 1:04:20.000]  cosmic UFO god race biggest Hispanic group la raza and match you separately say
[1:04:20.000 --> 1:04:23.920]  that I mean I've got the former Austin mayor Gus Garcia when he was mayor doing
[1:04:23.920 --> 1:04:30.800]  a proclamation saying the master race is Mexicans now that is insane just as
[1:04:30.800 --> 1:04:34.720]  insane as any of these other supremacist groups but it doesn't mean that I'm
[1:04:34.720 --> 1:04:39.640]  gonna hate all Mexicans because of it or that I'm going to say restrict Gus
[1:04:39.640 --> 1:04:45.960]  Garcia's right to say he's a god he wants to run around and say UFOs laid a
[1:04:45.960 --> 1:04:50.520]  green egg at Chichinitza and he hatched out of it and he's I mean I'm not
[1:04:50.520 --> 1:04:53.960]  kidding folks I got that video around her somewhere I've aired on my local TV
[1:04:53.960 --> 1:04:59.200]  show I know Steve Mason with Frontline Texas has got it right right off TV in

[1:11:04.400 --> 1:11:14.520]  global enslavement 995 when you get this new film we're carrying
[1:11:14.520 --> 1:11:22.840]  Maffa 21 black genocide in the 21st century America black genocide 21st
[1:11:22.840 --> 1:11:27.200]  century America they were stolen from their homes locked in chains and taken
[1:11:27.200 --> 1:11:30.440]  across an ocean and for more than 200 years their blood and sweat would help
[1:11:30.440 --> 1:11:33.600]  to build the richest and most powerful nation the world has ever known but when
[1:11:33.600 --> 1:11:37.120]  slavery ended their welcome was over America's wealthy elite had decided it
[1:11:37.120 --> 1:11:41.120]  was time for them to disappear and they were not particular about how it might
[1:11:41.120 --> 1:11:47.120]  be done well you're about to see is that the plan these people set in motion
[1:11:47.120 --> 1:11:50.400]  every two years ago was still being carried out today so don't think that
[1:11:50.400 --> 1:11:54.520]  this is history it is not this is what is happening here and it's happening now
[1:11:54.520 --> 1:12:00.000]  hmm and how the eugenics society turned into Planned Parenthood you can call up
[1:12:00.000 --> 1:12:03.040]  Planned Parenthood and say I hate blacks I want to exterminate them and they'll
[1:12:03.040 --> 1:12:08.720]  go oh yes give us the money and that's their main operation you can give this
[1:12:08.720 --> 1:12:13.320]  to liberals in the program because a liberal doesn't know they're a eugenicist
[1:12:13.320 --> 1:12:17.720]  you can talk to them and say you know the globalist won a global one-child
[1:12:17.720 --> 1:12:21.280]  policy or putting sterilization hormones and tetanus shots for women all over
[1:12:21.280 --> 1:12:24.120]  the world they've been caught here's mainstream news they'll say so what we
[1:12:24.120 --> 1:12:27.960]  need to they go yeah but ethically a government doing that why do you believe
[1:12:27.960 --> 1:12:32.120]  we need to do this it shouldn't people be told aren't you for freedom you're
[1:12:32.120 --> 1:12:35.760]  against killing Iraqi children they'll be like well of course well then you need
[1:12:35.760 --> 1:12:40.640]  to know about this they'll be like shut up but if you bring up how they take
[1:12:40.640 --> 1:12:45.200]  blacks with CPS test pesticides on them drugs kill them how they sterilized them
[1:12:45.200 --> 1:12:50.000]  how they euthanize the babies how it's still going on
[1:12:56.120 --> 1:13:03.960]  if you show them this information this will really deprogram them because they
[1:13:03.960 --> 1:13:07.240]  got a soft spot for black folks who they know have been persecuted and it's part
[1:13:07.240 --> 1:13:10.840]  of their overall guilt complex the globalist program them with it and there's
[1:13:10.840 --> 1:13:14.080]  nothing to do with blacks it's so they can say turn your guns in it's for blacks
[1:13:14.080 --> 1:13:19.440]  or pay more taxes is for blacks or you know give up your freedom of speech or
[1:13:19.440 --> 1:13:26.200]  you hate blacks it's just like a white guilt thing that they use well you give
[1:13:26.200 --> 1:13:29.600]  this to a yuppie this is something that may be able to deprogram them and it
[1:13:29.600 --> 1:13:33.120]  can stop the CPS from slaughtering the black kids because they they still kill
[1:13:33.120 --> 1:13:37.480]  them it's it's the one group that total open season is on and then they beta
[1:13:37.480 --> 1:13:41.480]  test everything on them and then roll it out later for everybody else so black
[1:13:41.480 --> 1:13:52.320]  genocide ma a fa mafa 21 black genocide in the 21st century America put up by
[1:13:52.320 --> 1:13:56.800]  life dynamics out of Dallas you you want to see this and know what it's all
[1:13:56.800 --> 1:14:02.440]  about black genocide this is the film every bleeding heart liberal should see
[1:14:02.440 --> 1:14:06.280]  this and understand who they've become who they support what Planned Parenthood
[1:14:06.280 --> 1:14:11.800]  is and by the way they source in game as one of their sources in this sub in game
[1:14:11.800 --> 1:14:15.960]  actually inspired this and see that that's my plan is that my films inspire
[1:14:15.960 --> 1:14:19.800]  other people to see the full horror of the New World Order and cause this
[1:14:19.800 --> 1:14:25.720]  cascade effect that can defeat them a chain reaction so don't wait take action
[1:14:25.720 --> 1:14:29.520]  be leaders fellow called in from Dallas saying I you know you come up here and
[1:14:29.520 --> 1:14:32.200]  help me set up a group to fight the New World Order look brother set it up
[1:14:32.200 --> 1:14:39.600]  yourself take action be focused be confident pick issues get out there and
[1:14:39.600 --> 1:14:44.080]  warn people start with telling people locally there's no law you got to take
[1:14:44.080 --> 1:14:49.040]  vaccines then have parents go in and find out they'll lie to you and say
[1:14:49.040 --> 1:14:52.280]  there isn't a waiver and then instruct them by federal law and state law to
[1:14:52.280 --> 1:14:54.920]  give it to you and they will and get mad then you'll know you're sitting there
[1:14:54.920 --> 1:14:58.720]  with a criminal in that nurse's office of that principal's office and that
[1:14:58.720 --> 1:15:02.360]  you've just been attempted to be lied to and then the rabbit hole begins there
[1:15:02.360 --> 1:15:05.920]  you show somebody they're being lied to about that you see this is how it happens
[1:15:05.920 --> 1:15:09.920]  we show them they're being lied to you pick an issue you attack the enemy with
[1:15:09.920 --> 1:15:17.920]  the truth the sort of truth you can't be stopped if you're committed but as
[1:15:17.920 --> 1:15:20.840]  their grid closes it's going to get harder and harder to slow them down and
[1:15:20.840 --> 1:15:27.160]  stop them alright I'm ranting the point is you can get that when you get this
[1:15:27.160 --> 1:15:29.920]  film you can get in game for half price whether we got a bunch of other new huge
[1:15:29.920 --> 1:15:33.040]  specials we're just slashing prices because we know the economy is going

[1:16:10.520 --> 1:16:15.800]  mega massive information Danny in the United Kingdom command base of the New
[1:16:15.800 --> 1:16:21.280]  World Order welcome. Hey great to be on the show. Great to have you Danny. Listen
[1:16:21.280 --> 1:16:25.960]  the show is getting better and better like you know fine wine every year just
[1:16:25.960 --> 1:16:30.000]  getting better and better Alex. Well that's because I get closer and closer to
[1:16:30.000 --> 1:16:34.040]  my death and I know I the time is short I've got to fight them as hard as I can.
[1:16:34.040 --> 1:16:39.240]  Yeah well thanks so much for for waking me up like everybody else it's pretty
[1:16:39.240 --> 1:16:44.760]  hard to realize that I'm actually living in you know the alien hives the
[1:16:44.760 --> 1:16:53.360]  nest of the alien queen so to speak. You certainly are my friend. You know a lot of
[1:16:53.360 --> 1:16:58.440]  my friends have woken up but a lot of them aren't interested in voting and they
[1:16:58.440 --> 1:17:05.700]  think the whole of politics is a scam. It's a real shame. There's one party called the
[1:17:05.700 --> 1:17:10.240]  United Kingdom independence party who are libertarian and people are just you
[1:17:10.240 --> 1:17:13.840]  know they're giving up already they you know what's the point in voting you
[1:17:13.840 --> 1:17:16.320]  know what's the point in paying any attention to any of it they're all they
[1:17:16.320 --> 1:17:19.400]  haven't given up they know the government's evil know all the polls show
[1:17:19.400 --> 1:17:22.200]  that they just don't believe in themselves so they are kind of
[1:17:22.200 --> 1:17:28.360]  capitulating but only in that they understand the grid is controlled but
[1:17:28.360 --> 1:17:32.440]  if everybody just starts saying no in little ways I mean look all these cops
[1:17:32.440 --> 1:17:37.440]  came out and said seven seven wasn't what you were told everybody who we've
[1:17:37.440 --> 1:17:41.560]  arrested is innocent they had to release all of the bombers now it's coming out
[1:17:41.560 --> 1:17:45.760]  the government did do it and suddenly they indicted all those cops to try to
[1:17:45.760 --> 1:17:52.400]  punish them for for telling the truth so see now other police see that but see
[1:17:52.400 --> 1:17:56.400]  now more and more are gonna resent that and realize so the government races to
[1:17:56.400 --> 1:18:01.000]  hire ignorant thugs but then ignorant thugs don't do a good job carrying out
[1:18:01.000 --> 1:18:04.720]  their operations so the system becomes weak look we're gonna kick their butts
[1:18:04.720 --> 1:18:10.560]  sir yeah we're gonna do it together go to go to date together so watch it
[1:18:10.560 --> 1:18:14.800]  looking at you a young citizens guide to the EU in the library today and some
[1:18:14.800 --> 1:18:18.160]  things that they were pointing out was they said that nationalism caused world
[1:18:18.160 --> 1:18:24.320]  war one and two yeah the the Nazi and the British and the US money got
[1:18:24.320 --> 1:18:28.920]  together and said we're gonna tell people nationalism caused war so we're
[1:18:28.920 --> 1:18:32.400]  gonna set up a dictatorship called the EU the Nazis had actually planned that's
[1:18:32.400 --> 1:18:37.520]  declassified it's not Nazi though it was just their plan was adopted and has a
[1:18:37.520 --> 1:18:44.680]  Nazi stripe in it a crump stripe in the whole system and yes everything is
[1:18:44.680 --> 1:18:49.640]  nationalism no everything is evil empires trying to take over and dominate
[1:18:49.640 --> 1:18:56.000]  that's what causes war and this new world order is a technocratic grid with a
[1:18:56.000 --> 1:19:00.680]  military underlay we've got listen people don't realize that if they don't do
[1:19:00.680 --> 1:19:05.200]  something about it now that the British hours is gonna be split into three three
[1:19:05.200 --> 1:19:08.960]  different regions it's already happened my friend they're already operating under
[1:19:08.960 --> 1:19:12.520]  that and that's what they always operate under it and then they tell the
[1:19:12.520 --> 1:19:13.960]  slaves later
[1:19:13.960 --> 1:19:19.960]  digitization Alex I know it's just unbelievable my friend
[1:19:19.960 --> 1:19:23.800]  digitize it digitization is what is that when they just take somewhere and
[1:19:23.800 --> 1:19:28.440]  raise it to the ground that's the word that was in the index well yeah they're
[1:19:28.440 --> 1:19:33.200]  always talking about how farming's back as it causes the area to turn into
[1:19:33.200 --> 1:19:37.400]  desert and that's more baloney the Sahara has been expanding because of low
[1:19:37.400 --> 1:19:42.080]  carbon dioxide levels in the last 2,000 years all these studies show they've
[1:19:42.080 --> 1:19:47.280]  done that's why the earth is an oxygen carbon dioxide poor state so the
[1:19:47.280 --> 1:19:50.040]  globalists are running around chemtrailing trying to increase that

[1:26:21.280 --> 1:26:24.600]  private corporations now I want to explain something reading Club of Rome
[1:26:24.600 --> 1:26:28.440]  documents reading CFR documents reading trial lateral Commission documents and
[1:26:28.440 --> 1:26:32.920]  then even in the last year reading Times of London financial Times of London BBC
[1:26:32.920 --> 1:26:37.400]  Wall Street Journal Time Magazine Newsweek they've all come out and
[1:26:37.400 --> 1:26:45.680]  openly pushed and tried to sell what 10 15 20 30 years ago was in UN documents in
[1:26:45.680 --> 1:26:51.160]  CFR books and in statements made by globalist and in policy reports ran
[1:26:51.160 --> 1:26:54.920]  corporation documents British Ministry of Defense documents that we've covered
[1:26:54.920 --> 1:27:00.720]  at nauseam here how they would bankrupt the world economy by design how they
[1:27:00.720 --> 1:27:04.080]  would bring in a world government run by the bankers because they will have the
[1:27:04.080 --> 1:27:08.280]  whole planet in debt to them with fiat currency and credit they made out of
[1:27:08.280 --> 1:27:14.480]  nothing backed up by our slave labor and how they would use the continuity of
[1:27:14.480 --> 1:27:19.200]  government systems to make all the nations get in line with their regulation
[1:27:19.200 --> 1:27:25.120]  and the payments now the way it was written previously the bankers always
[1:27:25.120 --> 1:27:28.040]  said they would then work through the National Security Councils of the
[1:27:28.040 --> 1:27:32.480]  nations and through the continuity of government national security states and
[1:27:32.480 --> 1:27:35.520]  through their agents that they would finance and put into elected positions
[1:27:35.520 --> 1:27:40.440]  now they're going further completely bypassing that and attempting to have
[1:27:40.440 --> 1:27:44.880]  Congress irrevocably and of course this is fraudulent so it doesn't stand
[1:27:44.880 --> 1:27:49.080]  Congress has said blacks aren't humans and Native Americans aren't humans it
[1:27:49.080 --> 1:27:53.320]  can be killed the courts have said that it's now in void you have an organic
[1:27:53.320 --> 1:27:58.360]  God-given right if you're an atheist it's organic natural law of your a
[1:27:58.360 --> 1:28:02.920]  Christian or religious person it's God's law when you hear we say God-given it
[1:28:02.920 --> 1:28:06.640]  means it's above the state I have a right I don't care if you say you have a
[1:28:06.640 --> 1:28:09.680]  right to kill my kids because you're the government you have a right to blow
[1:28:09.680 --> 1:28:13.600]  their heads off on national TV I have a right to fight you to the end and I
[1:28:13.600 --> 1:28:16.840]  don't care if you pass a law saying you can barbecue children on the White
[1:28:16.840 --> 1:28:28.080]  House lawn you don't have that right you understand now they'd always said they
[1:28:28.080 --> 1:28:31.040]  were going to do this through the executive now they're just bypassing
[1:28:31.040 --> 1:28:36.520]  that and saying the private Federal Reserve the private Bank of England the
[1:28:36.520 --> 1:28:40.640]  private Bundesbank they're all passing it simultaneously first they say give us
[1:28:40.640 --> 1:28:45.600]  the GDP of the nation and more in just a few months every nation on earth it's
[1:28:45.600 --> 1:28:50.320]  owned by these private bankers through fraud dumps the entire GDP and more
[1:28:50.320 --> 1:28:56.360]  everything they've got puts everybody into debt way past their head way above
[1:28:56.360 --> 1:29:00.800]  their heads to where they could never pay it back they complete the singularity
[1:29:00.800 --> 1:29:05.040]  of the black hole of debt of fraud claiming they totally on us then they

[1:29:34.040 --> 1:29:39.000]  the nations themselves not just a world government then controlling countries
[1:29:39.000 --> 1:29:42.880]  through their national security states their shadow governments but the banks
[1:29:42.880 --> 1:29:48.680]  openly turning off their cloaking device coming out in the open and
[1:29:48.680 --> 1:29:54.400]  announcing they are the government we're on the March the Empire's on the run

[1:33:21.400 --> 1:33:43.160]  over and over again in published books David Rockefeller said that he would
[1:33:43.160 --> 1:33:53.800]  like a autocratic fancy way of saying command and control tyranny authoritarian
[1:33:53.800 --> 1:33:59.200]  world government run by international bankers for their administrative
[1:33:59.200 --> 1:34:06.880]  convenience and they just so happen to be eugenicist and his father just so
[1:34:06.880 --> 1:34:13.440]  happen to finance the entire eugenics movement on a planetary scale on record
[1:34:13.440 --> 1:34:19.360]  in the encyclopedia Britannica now you want to world rulers who want to kill
[1:34:19.360 --> 1:34:23.040]  you dead in the hammer that sound like a good idea to you out there and look I'm

[1:34:26.520 --> 1:34:30.240]  telling you a historical fact I'm risking my life to bring you this
[1:34:30.240 --> 1:34:35.840]  information this isn't a game this isn't a joke it didn't patty cake anymore you
[1:34:35.840 --> 1:34:40.920]  been warned this is real now you better go check into the claims I've made that
[1:34:40.920 --> 1:34:44.720]  goes for you police to the think you're part of the system they're shooting you
[1:34:44.720 --> 1:34:49.120]  up with the same stuff you better grow up and listen to me right now for self
[1:34:49.120 --> 1:34:58.400]  preservation now this is worse than I even thought I said in the Obama
[1:34:58.400 --> 1:35:02.000]  deception and I said on October 3rd when they passed the banker take over bell I
[1:35:02.000 --> 1:35:05.400]  said they're now gonna announce a new bank of the world you pay your carbon
[1:35:05.400 --> 1:35:09.680]  taxes to they did that it's gonna set the interest rates it's gonna set the
[1:35:09.680 --> 1:35:12.920]  currency rates it's gonna control every fast year life and I'm gonna get into
[1:35:12.920 --> 1:35:22.000]  that next after I cover this and how this works but to have the bill and I
[1:35:22.000 --> 1:35:28.520]  have it here in front of me openly say that the banks will take over all these
[1:35:28.520 --> 1:35:32.280]  illegitimate federal powers the executives already claimed and then
[1:35:32.280 --> 1:35:37.160]  implement taking over any industries infrastructure land houses and then I
[1:35:37.160 --> 1:35:42.920]  have us say today in the LA Times with the headline about Barack Obama has
[1:35:42.920 --> 1:35:49.520]  planned to bulldoze a fourth of us cities what which is a big new
[1:35:49.520 --> 1:35:53.280]  brzezinski plan that's how they want to make the economy grow is to bulldoze all
[1:35:53.280 --> 1:35:58.720]  the houses instead of just letting people have them at a lower price because
[1:35:58.720 --> 1:36:02.720]  they were overvalued when they were built I mean this is an imploding
[1:36:02.720 --> 1:36:13.280]  eugenics zero growth carbon neutral economy that has nothing to do with the
[1:36:13.280 --> 1:36:16.800]  environment it's about surfdom and control a command and control economy
[1:36:16.800 --> 1:36:22.600]  we're gonna break that down look at this AP headline Democrats plan to pass
[1:36:22.600 --> 1:36:27.920]  financial overhaul quickly Democratic leaders have committed to enacting by
[1:36:27.920 --> 1:36:31.600]  the end of the year the biggest regulatory revision to the US financial
[1:36:31.600 --> 1:36:35.760]  system since the 1930s it isn't a revision to the financial system it
[1:36:35.760 --> 1:36:41.080]  states later that they'll be able to control everything well the president's
[1:36:41.080 --> 1:36:45.680]  already grabbing auto industries and firing CEOs and saying I control them
[1:36:45.680 --> 1:36:51.200]  and then giving it to foreign companies and governments and undertaking so
[1:36:51.200 --> 1:36:55.960]  ambitious it has some lawmakers worried about missteps so see it isn't about is
[1:36:55.960 --> 1:36:59.880]  this constitutional is this good the media is just oh it's gonna happen but
[1:36:59.880 --> 1:37:04.000]  will they do a good job will they save the economy member if you don't pass the
[1:37:04.000 --> 1:37:07.600]  bank or take over bill and give us 14.8 trillion at least there'll be a
[1:37:07.600 --> 1:37:12.160]  depression next week but if you do this we'll get the economy going and jobs
[1:37:12.160 --> 1:37:16.680]  will come back and then now each American just off that bailout owes over
[1:37:16.680 --> 1:37:22.400]  $200,000 to offshore banks we owe them money and interest to money we gave
[1:37:22.400 --> 1:37:32.200]  them the magnitude of this this is the end of the United States but it isn't
[1:37:32.200 --> 1:37:36.440]  just the US this is a world dictatorship what did that article in the
[1:37:36.440 --> 1:37:42.560]  Financial Times of London say with the headline with that famous headline and
[1:37:42.560 --> 1:37:47.320]  now for world government it says oh yes it's an authoritarian government and
[1:37:47.320 --> 1:37:50.680]  we've kept it secret from me because you know people aren't intellectual enough
[1:37:50.680 --> 1:37:53.880]  to understand we have to have it and there's too many people and it's a we've
[1:37:53.880 --> 1:37:57.360]  got to have the green revolution and we're gonna have these private bankers
[1:37:57.360 --> 1:38:04.560]  run things now I mean they're on record but I thought it would be through
[1:38:04.560 --> 1:38:07.840]  treaties and control and through the executives and through the national
[1:38:07.840 --> 1:38:14.200]  security grid now they're saying the bankers will openly run it and openly
[1:38:14.200 --> 1:38:18.400]  do whatever they want not just stealing tens of trillions every six seven
[1:38:18.400 --> 1:38:27.120]  months but quickly implementing the system this story is important and I'm
[1:38:27.120 --> 1:38:32.320]  asking every listener we've got to get this and get it on myspace YouTube your
[1:38:32.320 --> 1:38:36.160]  email list every other talk show host because I keep waiting and thinking
[1:38:36.160 --> 1:38:39.360]  other people the last few days since this was announced would understand this
[1:38:39.360 --> 1:38:43.280]  when it's stated in the Washington Times and Washington Post that all the
[1:38:43.280 --> 1:38:47.240]  bankers will run everything in America and control every industry and anything
[1:38:47.240 --> 1:38:49.760]  that affects the economy will be controlled by the private fellow
[1:38:49.760 --> 1:38:54.040]  reserve oh thank god they're going to save us the news is reporting what's
[1:38:54.040 --> 1:39:00.600]  really going on but saying it's a good thing like it's no big deal this will
[1:39:00.600 --> 1:39:05.640]  be the equivalent of a 10 trillion pound elephant landing on top of New York
[1:39:05.640 --> 1:39:10.560]  City crushing the entire city and no one even noticing are going oh gee there's
[1:39:10.560 --> 1:39:18.800]  a 20,000 foot tall 20,000 foot wide giant fat elephant and then oh hum what's the
[1:39:18.800 --> 1:39:21.720]  price of tea in China
[1:39:24.720 --> 1:39:31.440]  Obama regulatory reform plan officially establishes banking dictatorship in the
[1:39:31.440 --> 1:39:37.120]  United States yes you see because they can't just steal five trillion more than
[1:39:37.120 --> 1:39:43.000]  the GDP in seven months they can't just come in and do that that's why they got
[1:39:43.000 --> 1:39:47.040]  the New York Times yesterday reporting they're hiring felons for the new green
[1:39:47.040 --> 1:39:52.240]  brigades that are doing audits forcing their way in under city ordinances the
[1:39:52.240 --> 1:39:59.240]  feds get passed to force their way in your house these young criminal punks on
[1:39:59.240 --> 1:40:05.160]  power trips and that's going to be only jobs available it's not going to be
[1:40:05.160 --> 1:40:15.720]  government make work building dams or levees or roadside rest stops no that's
[1:40:15.720 --> 1:40:18.920]  bad enough because it's government control and it always gives given them
[1:40:18.920 --> 1:40:23.560]  kickbacks to locals so they'll support the corrupt regime we already have that
[1:40:23.560 --> 1:40:26.520]  with the tens of billions being given in different neighborhood groups two plus
[1:40:26.520 --> 1:40:30.520]  billion almost three billion to acorn alone being fenced out that's local pay
[1:40:30.520 --> 1:40:35.200]  offs and if you're in in good with the establishment GM or Chrysler your
[1:40:35.200 --> 1:40:39.440]  dealership gets to stay open on record you purchase it from the politicians oh
[1:40:39.440 --> 1:40:43.160]  I don't want to have my 15 million dollar or five million dollar depending on

[1:41:21.160 --> 1:41:25.840]  announcing everything from your hot dog shack on the corner of the street to a
[1:41:25.840 --> 1:41:30.280]  car dealership to a doctor's office everything's being taken over right now
[1:41:30.280 --> 1:41:35.480]  every farm every ranch every dental office they've got flotellas of
[1:41:35.480 --> 1:41:44.000]  torpedoes destroying every form of free market and liberty and they're smart in
[1:41:44.000 --> 1:41:47.680]  the first waves if you go work with them and pay them off they'll give you a few
[1:41:47.680 --> 1:41:51.800]  years to keep operating and most the uppy scum is rolling over just like they
[1:41:51.800 --> 1:41:59.120]  did in Nazi Germany and Soviet Russia they love it that most their competition
[1:41:59.120 --> 1:42:02.080]  gets shut down and they're the insiders they make the payments most I've watched
[1:42:02.080 --> 1:42:05.800]  these Democrats here in Austin they steal people's farms ranches swap team
[1:42:05.800 --> 1:42:09.960]  people that don't give them and then the mayor will openly retire open a bank he
[1:42:09.960 --> 1:42:14.520]  owns and then sell the stolen land publicly guarded by men with automatic
[1:42:14.520 --> 1:42:19.080]  weapons I mean it's just mafia ruling having their way doing whatever they
[1:42:19.080 --> 1:42:23.840]  want the police pulling people over all over Texas is robbing everyone laughing
[1:42:23.840 --> 1:42:30.680]  I mean it's just open evil everywhere and you ain't seen nothing yet

[1:42:38.440 --> 1:42:42.360]  you to death and they're gonna take them and they're gonna send huge paramilitary
[1:42:42.360 --> 1:42:47.240]  squads to kill you and your family if you don't unless we stand up and say no
[1:42:47.240 --> 1:42:55.560]  now period this is a hot takeover this isn't some socialist crawling slow
[1:42:55.560 --> 1:43:00.800]  stuff they decided to loot this place and got it down to nothing I'm gonna
[1:43:00.800 --> 1:43:05.400]  shut up and read this Obama regulatory reform plan officially established
[1:43:05.400 --> 1:43:08.640]  was banking dictatorship United States President Obama's plan to give the
[1:43:08.640 --> 1:43:11.680]  privately owned and unconstitutional Federal Reserve complete regulatory
[1:43:11.680 --> 1:43:16.520]  oversight across the entire US economy which is likely to be enacted before the
[1:43:16.520 --> 1:43:19.680]  end of the year will officially herald the beginning of a new form of
[1:43:19.680 --> 1:43:26.440]  government in the United States an ultra powerful banking dictatorship
[1:43:26.440 --> 1:43:33.480]  controlled by a small gaggle of shadowy and corrupt elitist on record the new
[1:43:33.480 --> 1:43:36.760]  rules would see the Fed given the authority to quote regulate any company
[1:43:36.760 --> 1:43:42.120]  whose activity it believes could threaten the economy in the markets you
[1:43:42.120 --> 1:43:45.120]  know forget him using taxpayer money to rig the stock market for themselves and
[1:43:45.120 --> 1:43:49.120]  insider trading every day with billions this is the whole economy grabbing
[1:43:49.120 --> 1:43:53.320]  businesses anything they want farms ranches it's all been announced this
[1:43:53.320 --> 1:43:58.560]  goes a step further than any centrally planned economies of the Soviet Union or
[1:43:58.560 --> 1:44:02.400]  communist China in that the Federal Reserve is not even accountable to the
[1:44:02.400 --> 1:44:06.720]  US government it is a private entity the according to former Fed Chairman Allen
[1:44:06.720 --> 1:44:13.320]  Greenspan is accountable to nobody but the banking families that own it we got
[1:44:13.320 --> 1:44:18.040]  a link right there to him on learn who's our Senate Obama's regulatory reform
[1:44:18.040 --> 1:44:21.680]  plan is nothing less than a green light for the complete and total takeover of
[1:44:21.680 --> 1:44:25.560]  the United States by a private banking cartel that will usurp the power of
[1:44:25.560 --> 1:44:30.840]  existing regulatory bodies who are now being blamed for the financial crisis in
[1:44:30.840 --> 1:44:35.200]  order that their status can be abolished and their roles handed over to the all
[1:44:35.200 --> 1:44:39.560]  powerful Fed yeah the private banks that own the private Fed are now going to be
[1:44:39.560 --> 1:44:43.720]  regulated by themselves and but they don't have to pay off people or have
[1:44:43.720 --> 1:44:48.480]  fake you know securities and exchange commissions now that they just used to
[1:44:48.480 --> 1:44:52.200]  send after their competition now it's just open to whatever they want over
[1:44:52.200 --> 1:44:56.040]  any part of the economy not just banks have you read the Patriot Act
[1:44:56.040 --> 1:45:00.440]  compliance everything to be tracked and traced as this the Speaker of the House
[1:45:00.440 --> 1:45:03.200]  said in China she said everything Americans do is going to be tracked and
[1:45:03.200 --> 1:45:09.840]  traced and chronicled and controlled and under the bailout the Times of London's
[1:45:09.840 --> 1:45:15.040]  reporting as well as us say today that taxpayer money is going to pay the
[1:45:15.040 --> 1:45:18.800]  Chinese to put in a carbon tax because they got to get everybody to get on
[1:45:18.800 --> 1:45:25.200]  board and then they're going to pay that tax directly back to the bankers they
[1:45:25.200 --> 1:45:28.240]  take our tax money give it to the Chinese and they pay it to the bankers I
[1:45:28.240 --> 1:45:32.480]  mean that is a scam isn't it according to the Associated Press report today
[1:45:32.480 --> 1:45:36.660]  Democratic leaders have committed to enacting the plan before the end of the
[1:45:36.660 --> 1:45:39.920]  year and the Republicans in both the House and Senate have indicated that they
[1:45:39.920 --> 1:45:42.880]  won't stand in the way of the overhaul see it's called oh we've had a bunch of
[1:45:42.880 --> 1:45:46.960]  banking crises and we've had the Federal Reserve steal 14.8 trillion in
[1:45:46.960 --> 1:45:51.440]  seven months the answer is is to get these bankers back in line and you do
[1:45:51.440 --> 1:45:57.240]  that by having them take over everything that'll sure teach them in other
[1:45:57.240 --> 1:46:00.680]  words the Fed which is already totally unconstitutional and unaccountable to
[1:46:00.680 --> 1:46:04.880]  Congress is to be placed in control complete control of the entirety of the
[1:46:04.880 --> 1:46:11.040]  US financial system to do as it wishes without repercussion all the healthy
[1:46:11.040 --> 1:46:14.080]  banks and insurance companies they don't own they're already forcing them to
[1:46:14.080 --> 1:46:17.240]  sell and hand it over but now they have the complete power to do it of this
[1:46:17.240 --> 1:46:20.560]  passage as the LA Times reports the government in conjunction with private
[1:46:20.560 --> 1:46:24.240]  Federal Reserve would effectively have the clout to simply seize and take over
[1:46:24.240 --> 1:46:30.880]  any company at desires that's the LA Times total absolute worse than the
[1:46:30.880 --> 1:46:35.240]  Nazis just absolutely this is what they did they seized everything they wanted
[1:46:35.240 --> 1:46:39.480]  this is out of and they weren't doing that till 43-44 when nobody could say
[1:46:39.480 --> 1:46:42.560]  no because Germany was already collapsing and all that was left was the
[1:46:42.560 --> 1:46:48.480]  Nazi Party as infrastructure I mean this is the ultimate tyranny
[1:46:48.480 --> 1:46:55.360]  this is unbelievable as the LA Times reports the government in conjunction
[1:46:55.360 --> 1:46:58.240]  with the probably run for reserve would effectively have the clout to simply
[1:46:58.240 --> 1:47:02.400]  seize and take over any company at desires what does this tell us that
[1:47:02.400 --> 1:47:05.960]  they're going for broke they are gonna implode the economy down to absolute
[1:47:05.960 --> 1:47:08.800]  nothing with people starving in the streets and filling up FEMA camps
[1:47:08.800 --> 1:47:16.600]  begging to be let into them to beta test that and set the precedent and when
[1:47:16.600 --> 1:47:19.200]  you sit there and say hey we're not supposed to be turning our guns and
[1:47:19.200 --> 1:47:21.960]  we're not supposed to be going to FEMA camps we're not supposed to have youth
[1:47:21.960 --> 1:47:24.880]  brigades marching up and down it's gonna be well they gotta have some kind of
[1:47:24.880 --> 1:47:28.400]  job thank God for the government the banks taking over or we'd have been
[1:47:28.400 --> 1:47:33.160]  totally destroyed and yeah they did take my ranch over and they say I might get
[1:47:33.160 --> 1:47:39.000]  it back if I'm a good Stuart and all these ponytail liberals with their
[1:47:39.000 --> 1:47:42.840]  machine guns will be on your property telling you what to do this is parasite
[1:47:42.840 --> 1:47:51.320]  world I can't believe it I mean this is worse than I even thought this is fast
[1:47:51.320 --> 1:47:55.280]  they just everything they're taking everything over why do you think they
[1:47:55.280 --> 1:47:58.720]  told Cosby paramilitary and hateful the public why do you think they're openly
[1:47:58.720 --> 1:48:03.720]  announced they're gonna use north com military on us there is no doubt they're
[1:48:03.720 --> 1:48:09.760]  planning hot purges there is no doubt now the final doubts I hope this was just
[1:48:09.760 --> 1:48:14.000]  sliding socialism and tyranny and you know boss hog corruption gone to seed
[1:48:14.000 --> 1:48:20.400]  it's not it's scientific blitzkrieg corruption absolute broke back America
[1:48:20.400 --> 1:48:25.320]  dead in the ditch overrun by corporate sharks just like they've done third
[1:48:25.320 --> 1:48:29.120]  world countries and they're putting in a hot military dictatorship with
[1:48:29.120 --> 1:48:34.680]  the distractionary puppet presidents for to fool the public so they can remove
[1:48:34.680 --> 1:48:38.560]  them from time to time and put in new puppets they're going for absolute
[1:48:38.560 --> 1:48:44.620]  total broke with no restrictions on any level of raping and controlling the
[1:48:44.620 --> 1:48:50.560]  population financially and physically absolutely illegitimate criminal rogue
[1:48:50.560 --> 1:48:55.760]  government where the government itself has no authority but look Congress
[1:48:55.760 --> 1:48:57.760]  already turned over all its trade authority the World Trade Organization
[1:48:57.760 --> 1:49:01.480]  private and they're just turning it over to the Federal Reserve now over all
[1:49:01.480 --> 1:49:07.000]  domestic operations I mean this is just unbelievable we've got to audit that fed
[1:49:07.000 --> 1:49:10.880]  we've got to let everybody know it's the bankers that are the criminals we got
[1:49:10.880 --> 1:49:16.200]  to shut these bastards down it's them or us folks and they are the real government
[1:49:16.200 --> 1:49:20.360]  no wonder when my Ron Paul myself go out to protest the Fed and give speeches
[1:49:20.360 --> 1:49:23.680]  that they have the army watching us saying we're terrorist and it's now

[1:55:24.520 --> 1:55:30.760]  30 years ago 20 years ago 15 years ago you let a private group of bankers take
[1:55:30.760 --> 1:55:36.160]  over the whole economy they're engaged in a cold-blooded corporate takeover and
[1:55:36.160 --> 1:55:39.240]  they're gonna blow out the rest the economy so they can buy it all up for
[1:55:39.240 --> 1:55:43.800]  pennies on the dollar and if you won't sell they're gonna send armed federal
[1:55:43.800 --> 1:55:47.680]  regulators in to take your car dealership your shopping mall your
[1:55:47.680 --> 1:55:55.720]  restaurant your factory AP LA Times Washington Post all saying it's good I
[1:55:55.720 --> 1:56:01.520]  read you the quotes about how any company any corporation anything they
[1:56:01.520 --> 1:56:06.920]  want the LA Times reports the government quote in conjunction with the
[1:56:06.920 --> 1:56:10.040]  private Federal Reserve would effectively have the cloud to simply
[1:56:10.040 --> 1:56:15.680]  seize and take over any company it desires now you know why they've hopped
[1:56:15.680 --> 1:56:18.560]  the cops up and told them they're God and told them to crack the skull anybody
[1:56:18.560 --> 1:56:21.960]  that looks at them wrong because they're there to make sure this this highway
[1:56:21.960 --> 1:56:26.400]  if they're gonna let little towns all over Texas and Florida and Michigan pull
[1:56:26.400 --> 1:56:32.600]  old ladies over and steal their purses why are the bankers allowing that because
[1:56:32.600 --> 1:56:38.080]  they want criminals in charge they're gonna hurt us all real bad this happens
[1:56:38.080 --> 1:56:41.600]  everywhere else in the world folks it's happening here and there's no more time
[1:56:41.600 --> 1:56:47.960]  to play games and suck your thumb and say we're making this up this is happening
[1:56:47.960 --> 1:56:52.000]  I mean I get chills all over me it's I'm actually getting nauseous right now
[1:56:52.000 --> 1:56:54.440]  thinking about this I mean it's one thing to know they're gonna do this but
[1:56:54.440 --> 1:56:58.240]  it's another to just see the bastards who destroyed our country wallowing in it
[1:56:58.240 --> 1:57:02.120]  and knowing that as things get worse and worse the way the psychology is gonna
[1:57:02.120 --> 1:57:05.400]  be they're gonna say alright do the next horrible thing we're saying or things
[1:57:05.400 --> 1:57:09.080]  won't get better and do the next thing you'll give us unlimited money and we'll
[1:57:09.080 --> 1:57:13.400]  fix it all things are getting worse now we need to have a financial dictatorship
[1:57:13.400 --> 1:57:18.560]  over the whole government in the country of offshore private corporations all
[1:57:18.560 --> 1:57:23.040]  right oh stuff's falling apart now you got to be in the work brigades I mean
[1:57:23.040 --> 1:57:27.680]  they're setting all this up they're hiring felons illegal aliens for the
[1:57:27.680 --> 1:57:31.920]  military and police forces I got the associated press with their hiring
[1:57:31.920 --> 1:57:42.320]  illegal aliens for the police force pointing out the flagrant conflict of
[1:57:42.320 --> 1:57:47.120]  interest in empowering the Federal Reserve to essentially regulate itself
[1:57:47.120 --> 1:57:51.840]  professor of public affairs the universe to Texas Austin Robert Auerbach writes
[1:57:51.840 --> 1:57:55.040]  the Federal Reserve has massive conflicts of interest that will make it
[1:57:55.040 --> 1:57:58.920]  ill-suited for its present regulatory functions and certainly for an expanded
[1:57:58.920 --> 1:58:05.320]  regulatory reach wait a minute what about it being unconstitutional over the
[1:58:05.320 --> 1:58:12.040]  executive the legislative and the judicial what about that what about its
[1:58:12.040 --> 1:58:17.760]  offshore corporations the officials leading the Fed today preside over an
[1:58:17.760 --> 1:58:23.760]  organization that is run in substantial part by bankers they regulate this is the
[1:58:23.760 --> 1:58:27.480]  u.t. professor bank regulators began at the 12th district Federal Reserve banks
[1:58:27.480 --> 1:58:30.720]  each governor by a nine-member board of directors two-thirds of whom are elected
[1:58:30.720 --> 1:58:36.320]  by the bankers in the district this is bank art dictatorship the end of the

[2:00:19.920 --> 2:00:31.640]  Alex Jones I get chills when I read this legislation I get chills in the AP and
[2:00:31.640 --> 2:00:35.800]  Los Angeles Times and Washington Post all announced like it's a good idea oh
[2:00:35.800 --> 2:00:40.000]  private banks will now rule America and be able to take over your gas station
[2:00:40.000 --> 2:00:46.440]  your hot dog stand your factory they will rule everything and it's mainstream
[2:00:46.440 --> 2:00:50.800]  news that it's worse than I had always thought from their own documents it's
[2:00:50.800 --> 2:00:54.640]  not just gonna be a bank of the world that sets world currency rates and sets
[2:00:54.640 --> 2:00:59.600]  interest rates and and sets tax rates worldwide but it's gonna shut down and
[2:00:59.600 --> 2:01:05.960]  take over and sees whatever businesses it wants Obama regulatory reform plan
[2:01:05.960 --> 2:01:10.360]  officially establishes banking dictatorship the United States key story at
[2:01:10.360 --> 2:01:16.200]  present planet calm and the way they work is they bankrupt the economy by
[2:01:16.200 --> 2:01:19.960]  design they say give us the banker takeover they still 14.8 trillion in
[2:01:19.960 --> 2:01:24.760]  seven months five trillion more than the entire GDP in a year online to double
[2:01:24.760 --> 2:01:31.480]  the GDP next October so from October to October double the GDP given to the
[2:01:31.480 --> 2:01:34.880]  banks that we then pay interest on we give them the money and then we had to
[2:01:34.880 --> 2:01:39.200]  pay interest on it to the offshore banks and they got away with that so why not
[2:01:39.200 --> 2:01:44.600]  go ahead and announce okay private banks will now rule the United States and the
[2:01:44.600 --> 2:01:49.160]  Federal Reserve governorship buildings with the army guarding them this is on
[2:01:49.160 --> 2:01:54.120]  the news the army now works for them this is in the news they're saying all
[2:01:54.120 --> 2:01:59.560]  protest is terrorism official news all protest is terrorism period just total
[2:01:59.560 --> 2:02:04.040]  tyranny and it says the executive powers are now to be given to the Fed and
[2:02:04.040 --> 2:02:08.240]  that Congress the courts have no authority no nothing and Congress is
[2:02:08.240 --> 2:02:16.440]  going to vote away this authority in with a treaty is what it is with the
[2:02:16.440 --> 2:02:22.160]  private Federal Reserve governors I mean this is incredible I knew this was
[2:02:22.160 --> 2:02:25.080]  coming later and that through the national security states they've set up
[2:02:25.080 --> 2:02:28.800]  the offshore banks the corporate takeover with an administrator governments
[2:02:28.800 --> 2:02:33.800]  but with some illusion still of a ceremonial Congress this removes it
[2:02:33.800 --> 2:02:39.400]  completely and the other big issue here is is that this isn't making a big
[2:02:39.400 --> 2:02:45.680]  splash they're just reporting yeah private banks in the words the LA Times the
[2:02:45.680 --> 2:02:48.480]  government in conjunction the private Federal Reserve would effectively have
[2:02:48.480 --> 2:02:58.120]  the clout to simply seize and take over any company it desires and it's got UT
[2:02:58.120 --> 2:03:01.880]  professors in here admitting it's a total takeover the sweeping overhaul the
[2:03:01.880 --> 2:03:06.080]  financial system detailed by Geithner on behalf of Obama administration does not
[2:03:06.080 --> 2:03:10.800]  overhaul the system at all writes promise giving the Fed a bigger role
[2:03:10.800 --> 2:03:14.520]  creating a council of regulators to oversee the existing oversight bodies
[2:03:14.520 --> 2:03:17.880]  and allowing the biggest Wall Street players to maintain their status leaves
[2:03:17.880 --> 2:03:21.360]  the system intact well it does more than that the Federal Reserve is not a
[2:03:21.360 --> 2:03:29.640]  fully public entity this is a professor whitewashing it has amassed a set of
[2:03:29.640 --> 2:03:36.400]  7.87 trillion worth of facilities a lot more than that and other entities through
[2:03:36.400 --> 2:03:40.720]  which it has lavish cheap loans in return for questionable collateral from the
[2:03:40.720 --> 2:03:46.400]  banking system which it's just the consortium or holding company of the
[2:03:46.400 --> 2:03:50.080]  private banks so to say it's regulating them as a joke it has kept the true
[2:03:50.080 --> 2:03:55.440]  nature of these transactions a secret despite numerous FOIA request and it
[2:03:55.440 --> 2:03:59.000]  has actively promoted the creation of bigger institutions in a chaotic
[2:03:59.000 --> 2:04:02.720]  environment rather than putting the brakes on the creation of these giants
[2:04:02.720 --> 2:04:07.520]  includes proof of the agenda of implementing overt financial dictatorship
[2:04:07.520 --> 2:04:12.600]  is being carefully coordinated can be seen the fact that an almost identical
[2:04:12.600 --> 2:04:17.320]  scheme is also being set up in the United Kingdom where quote the governor of the
[2:04:17.320 --> 2:04:20.600]  Bank of England has called for greater powers to allow it to fulfill its new
[2:04:20.600 --> 2:04:25.680]  role of promoting financial stability according to BBC over industries and
[2:04:25.680 --> 2:04:33.120]  companies just as the US King the head of the Bank of England is calling for a
[2:04:33.120 --> 2:04:38.000]  traditional independent regulatory bodies to be all but abolished and replaced
[2:04:38.000 --> 2:04:41.200]  by the Bank of England itself which just like the Federal Reserve is a private
[2:04:41.200 --> 2:04:44.960]  outfit with no accountability to the government whatsoever and it just goes
[2:04:44.960 --> 2:04:50.040]  on and on the article is devastating by Paul Watson all footnoted we need your

[2:09:33.240 --> 2:09:39.960]  absolute dictatorial power but nobody is I think putting all the pieces together
[2:09:39.960 --> 2:09:43.800]  of what this means and the interest of time I'm not going to read the rest of
[2:09:43.800 --> 2:09:52.800]  the article there's pages and pages left here with the things they're doing I
[2:09:52.800 --> 2:09:58.640]  mean these bastards have completely bankrupted our society by design now the
[2:09:58.640 --> 2:10:06.200]  most important facet to all of this is if we're unable to defeat the bankers
[2:10:06.200 --> 2:10:17.240]  doing their overhaul which gives them total government power through the
[2:10:17.240 --> 2:10:24.760]  national security grid and notice they just put up on the screen Gerald
[2:10:24.760 --> 2:10:28.200]  Salenta on Russia today by the way we're interviewing him again for the new
[2:10:28.200 --> 2:10:32.520]  Obama film and there he is saying Wall Street is Washington and Washington is
[2:10:32.520 --> 2:10:35.440]  Wall Street and there's all these top Democrats coming out and going yes
[2:10:35.440 --> 2:10:43.000]  banks completely run us and they're offshore banks in fact if I have time
[2:10:43.000 --> 2:10:47.600]  later that's only a six-minute clip I might I might play some of that here
[2:10:47.600 --> 2:10:56.480]  live at prisonplanet.tv this is just so incredible that I am actually dumb
[2:10:56.480 --> 2:11:03.080]  founded I just it's so over the top and then we're the weirdos for not wanting
[2:11:03.080 --> 2:11:07.120]  offshore banks openly running all corporations all companies if you make
[2:11:07.120 --> 2:11:10.880]  contributions to the political parties they let you keep your dealership open
[2:11:10.880 --> 2:11:15.720]  because the government runs it for political favors and they take over 10
[2:11:15.720 --> 2:11:19.320]  billion dollars off the stimulus money and give it to neighborhood groups and
[2:11:19.320 --> 2:11:24.640]  the New York Times reports oh the money's being spent to train Boy Scouts to do
[2:11:24.640 --> 2:11:28.320]  fugitive apprehension and gun confiscation and take on disgruntled vets
[2:11:28.320 --> 2:11:32.920]  for Homeland Security and it shows them with machine guns practicing and then
[2:11:32.920 --> 2:11:38.280]  yesterday oh the green cores made up of criminals who who've set their life
[2:11:38.280 --> 2:11:43.960]  straight now to go out and do audits of people's homes I mean and oh 13 million
[2:11:43.960 --> 2:11:47.840]  Obama supporters are going door-to-door asking people to support the health care
[2:11:47.840 --> 2:12:05.000]  takeover this is a complete and total raping of society and where does it go
[2:12:05.000 --> 2:12:12.400]  from here well the establishment is gonna follow the same methodology they're
[2:12:12.400 --> 2:12:19.240]  gonna continue to do this over and over and over again they are going to create
[2:12:19.240 --> 2:12:23.400]  the crisis say their solution is to give them more power and control crisis gets
[2:12:23.400 --> 2:12:27.040]  worse say do what we say or things are gonna get worse when they wanted the
[2:12:27.040 --> 2:12:30.040]  banker bailout in October people wouldn't do it they said there'll be a huge
[2:12:30.040 --> 2:12:34.320]  depression basically the end of the world the end of America if this doesn't
[2:12:34.320 --> 2:12:39.040]  happen and then things got worse when we did what they wanted and the corruption
[2:12:39.040 --> 2:12:43.040]  intensified they said it's secret where the trillions went we're not gonna tell
[2:12:43.040 --> 2:12:46.000]  you then the banks themselves brag and say we're getting a billion dollar
[2:12:46.000 --> 2:12:49.840]  bonuses we're buying up the infrastructure we're we're using federal
[2:12:49.840 --> 2:12:53.520]  regulators to force smaller banks and insurance companies to sell to us and
[2:12:53.520 --> 2:12:57.200]  we're buying them up with the bailout money it's a vertical integration a
[2:12:57.200 --> 2:13:02.760]  consolidation and now they're saying oh we got to have regulation a change of
[2:13:02.760 --> 2:13:10.800]  things a remake a upgrade as if it's a good thing an overhaul of the banking
[2:13:10.800 --> 2:13:14.400]  system and what is that total dictatorial power through the national
[2:13:14.400 --> 2:13:18.760]  security state for Wall Street that set up the CIA and the National Security
[2:13:18.760 --> 2:13:24.000]  Act of 47 in this whole system they're now just fully with the environmental
[2:13:24.000 --> 2:13:27.680]  regulations and with the corporate regulations and government regulations
[2:13:27.680 --> 2:13:32.040]  taking over the whole society and building up the massive paramilitary
[2:13:32.040 --> 2:13:35.360]  forces and North com openly announcing and preparing to engage the American
[2:13:35.360 --> 2:13:43.320]  people to carry this out now that said they will probably pass this things
[2:13:43.320 --> 2:13:48.240]  will further be bankrupted society will break down there will unemployment will
[2:13:48.240 --> 2:13:52.040]  be at 25 30 percent it's already really at 20 percent according to all the
[2:13:52.040 --> 2:13:55.880]  economists we have on the government's cook numbers are over 10 percent and then
[2:13:55.880 --> 2:13:59.800]  so the only pillar left will be the corrupt government funded by fiat
[2:13:59.800 --> 2:14:04.720]  currency and credit owned by the private bankers paid for with our tax money and
[2:14:04.720 --> 2:14:08.000]  again we pay interest to give them the money we give them the money and pay
[2:14:08.000 --> 2:14:13.080]  interest we're paying to be slaves it's a new form of slavery where you don't
[2:14:13.080 --> 2:14:17.920]  just not get paid as a slave but you pay to be a slave you understand a new
[2:14:17.920 --> 2:14:24.640]  level and the bankers are worshiped by the media their own and everybody says
[2:14:24.640 --> 2:14:28.000]  that they basically created the planet and that we got to pay taxes to breathe
[2:14:28.000 --> 2:14:31.640]  as the New York Times said in fact Google a tax on breathing I want to show
[2:14:31.640 --> 2:14:35.320]  people that New York Times headline where they say it's good though they say
[2:14:35.320 --> 2:14:40.040]  yesterday is the carbon tax will be a tax on respiration a tax to breathe or
[2:14:40.040 --> 2:14:45.560]  a tax on breathing was was the headline and they're going to use that to
[2:14:45.560 --> 2:14:50.360]  regulate shut down the farms and ranches fund huge bureaucrat armies with the
[2:14:50.360 --> 2:14:56.920]  unlimited cash they print to harass your businesses your factories huge carbon
[2:14:56.920 --> 2:15:01.320]  taxes on you not on China India Mexico and hundreds of other countries so that
[2:15:01.320 --> 2:15:06.320]  will further drive industry and jobs out then all that's left is big mega
[2:15:06.320 --> 2:15:12.920]  agribusiness and the big corporations will still own the the factories and
[2:15:12.920 --> 2:15:16.960]  the companies but they'll get government contracts to finance it and so you will
[2:15:16.960 --> 2:15:21.960]  go to work you will swipe a national ID card real ID to have your job the
[2:15:21.960 --> 2:15:27.080]  illegals will be exempt and will all be legalized under the guest worker program
[2:15:27.080 --> 2:15:31.920]  you'll be arrested for letting somebody mow your lawn for barter cash is going to
[2:15:31.920 --> 2:15:34.800]  be phased out even if you pay with cash it's going to have chips in it they've
[2:15:34.800 --> 2:15:38.240]  now announced this and then you'll thumb print to buy and sell there's going to
[2:15:38.240 --> 2:15:44.040]  be a graduated sales tax globally and a carbon tax or group of carbon taxes on
[2:15:44.040 --> 2:15:48.160]  that they're already passing those so every facet of your life is going to be
[2:15:48.160 --> 2:15:54.400]  micromanaged and controlled and all the major university grants and the tuition
[2:15:54.400 --> 2:15:57.920]  that's paid in the scholarships already the majority scholarships are law
[2:15:57.920 --> 2:16:03.600]  enforcement data mining homeland security infrastructure protection law
[2:16:03.600 --> 2:16:08.560]  enforcement ITT technical doesn't teach computer programming they're now ITT
[2:16:08.560 --> 2:16:12.080]  law enforcement or security guards and they're gonna have law enforcement power
[2:16:12.080 --> 2:16:17.240]  and so the entire economy is being shifted from a free market economy into a
[2:16:17.240 --> 2:16:21.080]  command and control with these private banks then own the private prisons own
[2:16:21.080 --> 2:16:24.560]  the private security firms own the private security firms that administered
[2:16:24.560 --> 2:16:28.640]  the municipal police departments and county sheriff's departments now being
[2:16:28.640 --> 2:16:31.680]  federalized and taken over by the states who then handed over to federal
[2:16:31.680 --> 2:16:37.240]  control and so you won't have a chance to be outside the system because the
[2:16:37.240 --> 2:16:43.720]  only jobs available will be government or government related and the very
[2:16:43.720 --> 2:16:50.760]  architecture of the job that are out there will be spying on your neighbors
[2:16:50.760 --> 2:16:55.560]  tattle tailing controlling people going after resistors micromanaging and
[2:16:55.560 --> 2:16:59.200]  squeezing all the farms and ranches through animal ID and premises ID
[2:16:59.200 --> 2:17:03.440]  yeah punch up that article taxing us for breathing real clear politics click
[2:17:03.440 --> 2:17:07.360]  on it go to the original article please we have an archive there but let's see
[2:17:07.360 --> 2:17:16.080]  if it's it's the blue link where it says real clear politics yep and you can see
[2:17:16.080 --> 2:17:20.480]  it there and then that article of our member reports on the New York Times yes
[2:17:20.480 --> 2:17:24.280]  it says last week the New York Times published an extraordinary editorial
[2:17:24.280 --> 2:17:27.600]  explaining that right now everyone is using an atmosphere like a municipal
[2:17:27.600 --> 2:17:31.720]  dump depositing carbon dioxide free the Times editor suggested that the
[2:17:31.720 --> 2:17:35.680]  government start charging for the privilege by imposing a carbon tax or
[2:17:35.680 --> 2:17:40.960]  tax on breathing yeah click on the New York Times link there you have it so
[2:17:40.960 --> 2:17:47.200]  there is the control grid that we're discussing and breaking down here and so
[2:17:47.200 --> 2:17:52.880]  you won't have a choice you'll have to join the police academy or the federal
[2:17:52.880 --> 2:18:01.080]  academy you will have to go into their grids you will have to follow what
[2:18:01.080 --> 2:18:04.480]  they're saying because the whole society's designed they'll only be credit
[2:18:04.480 --> 2:18:08.360]  they'll only be loans given to the bankers out of fiat nothingness backed
[2:18:08.360 --> 2:18:12.520]  up with your tax money to select industries they want and they say
[2:18:12.520 --> 2:18:16.760]  they're doing this because of robotics and automation everybody's gonna have
[2:18:16.760 --> 2:18:21.240]  cars and Xboxes and entertainment but you're gonna be in compact cities and
[2:18:21.240 --> 2:18:25.920]  highly controlled they want to phase all that out and give you jobs in
[2:18:25.920 --> 2:18:30.000]  surveilling and controlling people so they can get their pure dictatorship
[2:18:30.000 --> 2:18:34.760]  their scientific dictatorship in control to then carry out the forced
[2:18:34.760 --> 2:18:39.360]  eugenics and forced exterminations and because the ratio will be 10% of the
[2:18:39.360 --> 2:18:44.800]  public at least being cops alone heavily armed licensed to kill at the drop of a
[2:18:44.800 --> 2:18:50.480]  hat for talking back and then another 40 50% they're saying will be bureaucracy
[2:18:50.480 --> 2:18:56.760]  and surveillance they're talking well over half being government and then the
[2:18:56.760 --> 2:19:00.600]  rest will be corporation servicing government and only if you're an
[2:19:00.600 --> 2:19:03.840]  insider only if you've got special connections will you be able to own a
[2:19:03.840 --> 2:19:08.320]  farm a ranch a business and then in successive waves they're gonna take
[2:19:08.320 --> 2:19:12.400]  those over as well and then only give you a small percentage of your original
[2:19:12.400 --> 2:19:16.800]  business profits and then phase it out completely corruption will run rampant
[2:19:16.800 --> 2:19:22.280]  like it in the Soviet Union Maoist China and Nazi Germany and Soviet Germany
[2:19:22.280 --> 2:19:26.920]  and Eastern Germany locals will kill you imprison you for your property your

[2:24:43.640 --> 2:24:49.000]  swinging on the swings so I think they're gonna go up there and later they're
[2:24:49.000 --> 2:24:52.120]  gonna go visit one of the shopping malls they've publicly turned into a FEMA
[2:24:52.120 --> 2:24:55.920]  local center then they have big regional camps that have all these little
[2:24:55.920 --> 2:25:00.240]  federal spoke camps for aid and you're not against FEMA they're giving out food
[2:25:00.240 --> 2:25:04.280]  you're not against North com outrunning checkpoints for drunk drivers and
[2:25:04.280 --> 2:25:09.720]  helping it car wrecks see it all has PR purposes winning the hearts and minds of
[2:25:09.720 --> 2:25:14.640]  the occupied slave mass so they come in and shut off the resources and even the
[2:25:14.640 --> 2:25:18.160]  troops handing out bags of food think they're helping not knowing their
[2:25:18.160 --> 2:25:22.760]  bank or masters are gonna shut the food off by the way everybody's freaking out
[2:25:22.760 --> 2:25:26.000]  over this blackjack comic book that was in the London telegraph where the
[2:25:26.000 --> 2:25:30.200]  government stages nuke attacks and brings in martial law and now the London
[2:25:30.200 --> 2:25:34.800]  telegraphs and putting out blurbs about real FEMA drills that they're doing
[2:25:34.800 --> 2:25:37.520]  with the Pentagon and foreign governments it's on Homeland Security's
[2:25:37.520 --> 2:25:42.240]  website and North com to take over the US and so they have a comic book
[2:25:42.240 --> 2:25:46.640]  simultaneously that has these codes that everybody's breaking and it even tells
[2:25:46.640 --> 2:25:51.440]  you how to break the codes it's like comic book stuff to promote the launch of
[2:25:51.440 --> 2:26:00.360]  a new Jericho comic book and then it simultaneously list real FEMA martial
[2:26:00.360 --> 2:26:07.120]  law takeover drills going on now this week and so now when we talk about the
[2:26:07.120 --> 2:26:12.360]  real FEMA drills they'll go oh that was that comic book this is all a Psyop this
[2:26:12.360 --> 2:26:16.760]  is why they do this psychiatrists run these operations and I've read
[2:26:16.760 --> 2:26:19.400]  different documents on why they do it but they believe it's revelation of the
[2:26:19.400 --> 2:26:24.920]  method it confuses reality with unreality it's like oh you said the
[2:26:24.920 --> 2:26:27.720]  government flew a hijacked jet in the World Trade Center and used drills to
[2:26:27.720 --> 2:26:32.360]  make Norrath stand down that was on X files six months before 9-11 you got it
[2:26:32.360 --> 2:26:37.520]  from that we're like yeah exactly but there really were drills on 9-11 to
[2:26:37.520 --> 2:26:42.400]  make Norrath stand down it was just like the TV program and they go no it was a
[2:26:42.400 --> 2:26:46.640]  TV show so massive programming going on there we're gonna have a report for you
[2:26:46.640 --> 2:26:55.160]  at prismplanet.com coming up later on that subject as well so definitely stay
[2:26:55.160 --> 2:27:01.440]  with us for that but again in the real world not a comic book not a joke is
[2:27:01.440 --> 2:27:08.120]  this zoom in on that for me again please this is so important ladies and
[2:27:08.120 --> 2:27:12.760]  gentlemen this is absolutely vital for everybody to look at everybody to
[2:27:12.760 --> 2:27:16.560]  understand Obama regulatory reform plan officially established was banking

[2:27:29.040 --> 2:27:33.880]  last segment about how your kids are gonna live in dormitories that's in the
[2:27:33.880 --> 2:27:36.720]  government documents that's in the textbooks we've posted link to at
[2:27:36.720 --> 2:27:41.640]  info wars.com where they say the family is animalistic and ancient and belongs to
[2:27:41.640 --> 2:27:46.320]  the age of barbarism and has got to be outlawed and they admit now the CIA
[2:27:46.320 --> 2:27:49.800]  set up miss magazine to break up the family so both the husband and wife
[2:27:49.800 --> 2:27:53.400]  have got to work for the bankers and pay taxes so the state raises the kids and
[2:27:53.400 --> 2:27:57.440]  now the economy gets worse and worse and right on time the government says oh
[2:27:57.440 --> 2:28:01.840]  we'll keep your babies from birth in head start government programs and
[2:28:01.840 --> 2:28:05.600]  inoculate them and drug them and take care of them and we'll keep your kids
[2:28:05.600 --> 2:28:10.480]  after school until 7, 8, 9, 10 at night so you can have a chance after work to go

[2:28:18.880 --> 2:28:21.680]  don't mind if I do
[2:28:22.320 --> 2:28:26.560]  China the poor families have their kids live in dormitories and then work in
[2:28:26.560 --> 2:28:31.160]  fireworks factories and other factories five six hours a day and then go to
[2:28:31.160 --> 2:28:34.160]  government training and the rest of the day learning how to worship the state
[2:28:34.160 --> 2:28:37.840]  learning how to turn in their parents and then as this gets worse and worse and
[2:28:37.840 --> 2:28:41.680]  the kids are already showing up in red and black uniforms these city year
[2:28:41.680 --> 2:28:45.280]  groups running by David Gergen who gets all this money from the feds to do it
[2:28:45.280 --> 2:28:51.920]  under swearing allegiance to Obama hiring felons and criminals to join it
[2:28:51.920 --> 2:28:54.880]  this is in the New York Times but they're reporting it like it's good
[2:28:54.880 --> 2:28:59.520]  then the kids come home with these tickets they write mock tickets to their
[2:28:59.520 --> 2:29:03.440]  parents you took a hot bath that's a green crime and then they give a copy to
[2:29:03.440 --> 2:29:07.280]  the parents and then take it this is in the New York Times and the parents are
[2:29:07.280 --> 2:29:11.840]  oh i'm so glad my daughter's reporting me so see it's for this oh it's for the

[2:33:17.040 --> 2:33:20.400]  lawyers down at the press conference last week
[2:33:20.400 --> 2:33:25.840]  fighting the senate bill 1440 they have similar bills around the country
[2:33:25.840 --> 2:33:30.800]  to kidnap people's children without a warrant without a court order without a
[2:33:30.800 --> 2:33:34.160]  judge's order just to come grab them for any reason
[2:33:34.160 --> 2:33:37.760]  if they want to because they got in trouble kidnapping those 400 plus kids
[2:33:37.760 --> 2:33:40.640]  from those Mormons it turned out it was all made up lies
[2:33:40.640 --> 2:33:44.080]  and the uh supreme court said they did wrong so they just said you know what
[2:33:44.080 --> 2:33:48.000]  we'll just pass a law saying there's no more fourth amendment in Texas
[2:33:48.000 --> 2:33:50.880]  and of course you can say well they got to do this to keep kids safe
[2:33:50.880 --> 2:33:53.920]  depending on which federal numbers you look at five to seven times more
[2:33:53.920 --> 2:33:58.000]  likely for cps to abuse children than any other group
[2:33:58.000 --> 2:34:01.280]  I mean this is a very dangerous crew of people so we'll talk to those folks
[2:34:01.280 --> 2:34:04.400]  coming up here in just one moment before we do that I want to tell you about a
[2:34:04.400 --> 2:34:07.280]  few of the sponsors that have made this radio show possible today and
[2:34:07.280 --> 2:34:11.440]  sponsors I believe in when you're on info wars.com
[2:34:11.440 --> 2:34:19.360]  look for max the little orange gorilla and max the little orange gorilla
[2:34:19.360 --> 2:34:23.680]  is a banner that will lead you to homegain.com that's their
[2:34:23.680 --> 2:34:29.600]  mascot h o m e g a i n dot com and they it's a free site been around for more
[2:34:29.600 --> 2:34:32.720]  than 10 years you enter in your street address or address of a house you're
[2:34:32.720 --> 2:34:36.560]  looking at it will tell you internally what the realtors are seeing
[2:34:36.560 --> 2:34:40.800]  what what the market really thinks your house is worth or what the house
[2:34:40.800 --> 2:34:44.080]  you're looking at is worth an invaluable tool bunch of other free tools like the
[2:34:44.080 --> 2:34:48.560]  home sale maximizer you enter into that some of the more
[2:34:48.560 --> 2:34:52.320]  less expensive upgrades you could do to a house
[2:34:52.320 --> 2:34:56.480]  or repairs that will increase the resale value
[2:34:56.480 --> 2:35:00.240]  the greatest I mean basically this gives you all the insider tricks
[2:35:00.240 --> 2:35:03.680]  that the realtors know that they don't tell you when you're buying or
[2:35:03.680 --> 2:35:07.680]  selling a house so homegain.com be sure and check that out
[2:35:07.680 --> 2:35:11.360]  also mysolarbackup.com this is a great little solar
[2:35:11.360 --> 2:35:15.440]  power unit it's got 1800 watts of power on demand the event of any disaster
[2:35:15.440 --> 2:35:21.040]  or outage and so with the depression with the talk of war with the government
[2:35:21.040 --> 2:35:24.800]  wanting to restrict how much power you can have
[2:35:24.800 --> 2:35:28.400]  I'm wanting to jack up prices it's just great to start getting off the grid
[2:35:28.400 --> 2:35:31.680]  and these are great little solar power generators that will help you start in
[2:35:31.680 --> 2:35:36.160]  that direction mysolarbackup.com the website's mysolarbackup.com
[2:35:36.160 --> 2:35:40.720]  that's one word mysolarbackup.com or 877-327-0365
[2:35:40.720 --> 2:35:47.120]  877-327-0365 mysolarbackup.com and in closing while we're talking
[2:35:47.120 --> 2:35:49.440]  about what supports the show and makes it all possible
[2:35:49.440 --> 2:35:54.000]  I'm slashing the price of in game to 9.95 because this film is so important
[2:35:54.000 --> 2:35:57.600]  two hours 40 minutes long the globalist master plan the architecture of the
[2:35:57.600 --> 2:36:02.800]  new world order how they operate it is slashed in price and if you get
[2:36:02.800 --> 2:36:08.240]  MAFA 21 black genocide the 21st century America
[2:36:08.240 --> 2:36:15.840]  I guess that's Zulu for murder or genocide and this is
[2:36:15.840 --> 2:36:19.680]  this uses some of the work of in game but to document just how the eugenicists
[2:36:19.680 --> 2:36:23.280]  are using the family courts the family courts were set up in the U.S. to
[2:36:23.280 --> 2:36:26.800]  sterilize blacks kill blacks euthanize black babies
[2:36:26.800 --> 2:36:30.160]  and that's also covered in in game but only like five minutes of in game gets
[2:36:30.160 --> 2:36:34.160]  into that I cover the whole spectrum of the CPS courts are illegitimate they
[2:36:34.160 --> 2:36:37.920]  don't have to process because they were set up as race hygiene courts
[2:36:37.920 --> 2:36:41.200]  then Hitler picked them up from the U.S. and England
[2:36:41.200 --> 2:36:45.280]  so we hope you get that because in games only 9.95 when you get it with this
[2:36:45.280 --> 2:36:48.800]  new eugenics film and also life on the edge of a bubble documenting what the
[2:36:48.800 --> 2:36:51.040]  bankers are doing how they're running all this
[2:36:51.040 --> 2:36:55.360]  okay I apologize to Jerry Lynn Ward and
[2:36:55.360 --> 2:36:59.520]  Joanna Scott because our power went out last week and we had battery backup but
[2:36:59.520 --> 2:37:01.520]  we weren't sure if we'd be able to stay up and
[2:37:01.520 --> 2:37:03.920]  sure enough the batteries ran out in 20 minutes so it's good that we went to
[2:37:03.920 --> 2:37:07.920]  rebroadcast because we couldn't have the show disrupted but they're here now
[2:37:07.920 --> 2:37:12.960]  covering SB 1440 and Jerry Lynn Ward introduce yourself briefly and we'll
[2:37:12.960 --> 2:37:17.360]  get Joanna Scott to introduce herself and then let's break down what this
[2:37:17.360 --> 2:37:20.720]  bill does yes thank you for having me on I'm an
[2:37:20.720 --> 2:37:25.040]  attorney here in Austin Texas and I got involved in this because a year ago I
[2:37:25.040 --> 2:37:29.840]  became so outraged about CPS taking those 400 some
[2:37:29.840 --> 2:37:34.720]  FLDS kids and I decided to volunteer to help one of the dads
[2:37:34.720 --> 2:37:38.320]  fight CPS and I entered a world that I didn't even know existed
[2:37:38.320 --> 2:37:41.840]  before that time and I'm as horrified as you
[2:37:41.840 --> 2:37:46.960]  at these CPS courts and at the whole system I've practiced law for 29 years
[2:37:46.960 --> 2:37:51.200]  and I did civil trial in other areas and they they think that they don't have to
[2:37:51.200 --> 2:37:56.320]  follow the rules of due process in these courts and with regard to CPS it's
[2:37:56.320 --> 2:38:01.040]  just horrifying well 34 states by 1930
[2:38:01.040 --> 2:38:05.520]  had passed the eugenics race laws and I'm just telling you this because see you
[2:38:05.520 --> 2:38:09.200]  were in the real court system and then you in the constitutional system then
[2:38:09.200 --> 2:38:13.120]  you entered the parallel universe of the family court the health department
[2:38:13.120 --> 2:38:17.440]  racial hygiene and this is the max Kaiser
[2:38:17.440 --> 2:38:22.560]  Kaiser Wilhelm not max Kaiser the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute
[2:38:22.560 --> 2:38:26.560]  this is that whole system the Rockefellers funded for race hygiene so
[2:38:26.560 --> 2:38:30.640]  that's why these courts don't operate with due process but now they want to
[2:38:30.640 --> 2:38:35.760]  I guess remove the final link so let's bring up
[2:38:35.760 --> 2:38:39.280]  Joe Anna Scott Joe Anna tell us about yourself
[2:38:39.280 --> 2:38:43.520]  well I am actually not an attorney I am a parent advocate I'm executive director
[2:38:43.520 --> 2:38:47.680]  for a 501c3 organization that I founded with my sister called parent
[2:38:47.680 --> 2:38:51.200]  guidance center and we exclusively advocate for these parents that are
[2:38:51.200 --> 2:38:55.200]  involved with the child protective system well I bet you get flooded with
[2:38:55.200 --> 2:38:57.200]  the millions of kids they're stanching every year
[2:38:57.200 --> 2:39:00.640]  okay let's go back let's go back to Jerry Lynn Ward
[2:39:00.640 --> 2:39:04.240]  and then we'll go back to Joe Anna Jerry for about five minutes break down
[2:39:04.240 --> 2:39:08.160]  what you've seen in the courts what this new bill does it's on the governor's
[2:39:08.160 --> 2:39:11.440]  desk how we defeat it then we'll get a Joe Anna's take on it
[2:39:11.440 --> 2:39:15.520]  well what happened is that CPS got slapped down pretty good
[2:39:15.520 --> 2:39:19.120]  in the supreme court case in the third court of appeals case in the FLDS case
[2:39:19.120 --> 2:39:25.280]  but also in the Gary Gates case and I believe that what this law is is an
[2:39:25.280 --> 2:39:29.360]  attempt to get around the Gary Gates case now they claim
[2:39:29.360 --> 2:39:33.200]  that the reason they introduced this bill was to
[2:39:33.200 --> 2:39:36.960]  affect what the court the Fifth Circuit said
[2:39:36.960 --> 2:39:41.360]  in the Gary Gates case but in my opinion they're not doing that with the
[2:39:41.360 --> 2:39:45.600]  trying to do is a halfway job that gives more power to CPS
[2:39:45.600 --> 2:39:49.200]  that does not give the full constitutional protection that the
[2:39:49.200 --> 2:39:53.120]  Fifth Circuit had in mind and essentially just empowers CPS
[2:39:53.120 --> 2:39:56.480]  to get into people's houses especially people like home
[2:39:56.480 --> 2:40:00.400]  schoolers or like who keeps their kids at home
[2:40:00.400 --> 2:40:03.840]  to whom CPS has no access to the government schools
[2:40:03.840 --> 2:40:08.240]  but also like the FLDS who had that private school
[2:40:08.240 --> 2:40:11.840]  at the ranch so what this is is an attempt to get in there
[2:40:11.840 --> 2:40:15.120]  they purport that it's like a search warrant but they don't have the
[2:40:15.120 --> 2:40:18.560]  protections for the affidavits that would underlie this
[2:40:18.560 --> 2:40:22.160]  order and aid of investigation that they're trying to caught a child
[2:40:22.160 --> 2:40:26.240]  absolutely it's a it's a fake search warrant a fake order they can also use
[2:40:26.240 --> 2:40:28.960]  it to steal people's children out of the school
[2:40:28.960 --> 2:40:32.960]  the way I've read the bill then there's a whole other area of discussion of how
[2:40:32.960 --> 2:40:36.480]  this passed how Kirk Watson tagged it on
[2:40:36.480 --> 2:40:40.000]  a bill that wasn't as bad uh Kirk Watson of course a great
[2:40:40.000 --> 2:40:44.000]  fount of wickedness I've known him of old as the former Austin Mayor
[2:40:44.000 --> 2:40:48.560]  snatching people's property and Johanna can speak to that because she's the one
[2:40:48.560 --> 2:40:52.720]  that detected the problem and immediately reacted oh so yeah yeah
[2:40:52.720 --> 2:40:56.720]  let's go back to Johanna then Scott here uh tell us so you
[2:40:56.720 --> 2:41:00.240]  ferreted this out you detected the scalduggery tell us
[2:41:00.240 --> 2:41:04.240]  about it yes originally it was Senate bill 1064
[2:41:04.240 --> 2:41:07.840]  which was just to access a child's medical or mental
[2:41:07.840 --> 2:41:13.920]  records during an investigation we watched it it didn't have any it wasn't
[2:41:13.920 --> 2:41:17.200]  that bad I mean it was just kind of a normal thing yeah they kind of do this
[2:41:17.200 --> 2:41:20.880]  anyway but they also had to leave to get those
[2:41:20.880 --> 2:41:24.880]  records they had good cause shown and the parents could have a hearing
[2:41:24.880 --> 2:41:28.560]  and it was fine I mean it had due process but the problem is they always
[2:41:28.560 --> 2:41:32.080]  fill out fake reports anyways and lie and like you said they're already
[2:41:32.080 --> 2:41:35.440]  ignoring the law they're trying to retroactively get rid of the bill of
[2:41:35.440 --> 2:41:38.400]  rights because people are pointing out they're not following it but go ahead
[2:41:38.400 --> 2:41:42.320]  but what they did the original senate hearing is they did a committee
[2:41:42.320 --> 2:41:46.240]  substitute which was nothing like the original
[2:41:46.240 --> 2:41:49.760]  and it's what we see today it was completely different
[2:41:49.760 --> 2:41:52.960]  and all the players um they already knew that the
[2:41:52.960 --> 2:41:55.520]  they had to have known that the substitute was coming because they were
[2:41:55.520 --> 2:41:57.920]  already willing and able to testify about it
[2:41:57.920 --> 2:42:03.520]  right then and there um we weren't at the hearing on the senate side because
[2:42:03.520 --> 2:42:06.880]  like I said we didn't know about the committee substitute we caught the
[2:42:06.880 --> 2:42:09.520]  committee substitute when it went to the house side
[2:42:09.520 --> 2:42:12.720]  and that's where the you know school dougary or whatever you want to call
[2:42:12.720 --> 2:42:18.000]  it began because we did uh we did have testimony at the house
[2:42:18.000 --> 2:42:22.480]  hearing before Patrick Rose's um subcommittee on human services
[2:42:22.480 --> 2:42:25.920]  and our testimony has apparently disappeared
[2:42:25.920 --> 2:42:29.920]  we are on the film as you know showing here's our cards being turned in here's
[2:42:29.920 --> 2:42:33.440]  our written testimony the hearing didn't happen that day
[2:42:33.440 --> 2:42:36.880]  they didn't finish that hearing that okay regardless
[2:42:36.880 --> 2:42:40.320]  so regardless he tagged this song that anybody knowing it's now
[2:42:40.320 --> 2:42:43.760]  gone to the governor's desk what are we getting anything out of parry with the
[2:42:43.760 --> 2:42:46.880]  thousands of phone calls he's gotten and knowing it's going to be thrown out of
[2:42:46.880 --> 2:42:51.360]  court but tens of thousands of kidnapped kids later
[2:42:51.360 --> 2:42:57.360]  we we've heard crickets chirping so far yeah yeah unfortunately yeah um you
[2:42:57.360 --> 2:43:00.800]  have to remember this this is something that
[2:43:00.800 --> 2:43:04.960]  certain people including legislators were told had to happen
[2:43:04.960 --> 2:43:08.240]  the department was told the department itself
[2:43:08.240 --> 2:43:12.960]  did not ask for this the department of family protective services did not go
[2:43:12.960 --> 2:43:16.080]  you know their administrative people the commissure go oh the gary gate's
[2:43:16.080 --> 2:43:19.680]  decision is horrible oh the flds should have never they didn't go say what can
[2:43:19.680 --> 2:43:23.760]  we do about this this is a group text-for-text out of
[2:43:23.760 --> 2:43:27.440]  dallas brought this bill
[2:43:27.440 --> 2:43:31.200]  well also the way to go after what's in in people is they've had a lot of
[2:43:31.200 --> 2:43:34.560]  judges and people get in trouble for taking money
[2:43:34.560 --> 2:43:37.680]  from the foster parent lobbies and the child
[2:43:37.680 --> 2:43:41.680]  trafficking lobbies it's what they are they even have bounties i've had
[2:43:41.680 --> 2:43:45.040]  state senator from george on where she listed how they say we need a blonde
[2:43:45.040 --> 2:43:48.720]  hair blue eyed kid a family wants it they're going to pay 400 grand for it
[2:43:48.720 --> 2:43:51.600]  through these adoption agencies so if we can catch
[2:43:51.600 --> 2:43:56.000]  watson or others we know this goes on judge jean miran whoever getting money
[2:43:56.000 --> 2:43:59.200]  from these groups we need to go ahead and go to the grand jury and call for
[2:43:59.200 --> 2:44:02.240]  indictments because this is done all over the country and i'm saying play
[2:44:02.240 --> 2:44:05.200]  hardball with these people but but i'm but but let's talk about the bill i
[2:44:05.200 --> 2:44:09.280]  keep digressing gerrylyn ward i believe you were just speaking so you're
[2:44:09.280 --> 2:44:11.840]  saying it looks like watson's i'm not excuse me
[2:44:11.840 --> 2:44:15.680]  not kirk watson looks like governor perry's gonna sign this
[2:44:15.680 --> 2:44:20.720]  well we don't know what i what i'm saying is that we don't i i know of no one
[2:44:20.720 --> 2:44:23.840]  or no one contacted me to say that they've heard anything
[2:44:23.840 --> 2:44:27.760]  with respect with what he's going to do with this bill which is
[2:44:27.760 --> 2:44:31.600]  pretty amazing to me because the groups that are have come out against this
[2:44:31.600 --> 2:44:35.040]  bill are simply his core constituency so i don't know
[2:44:35.040 --> 2:44:39.600]  uh... what he's doing with respect to this i mean it like johanna said this
[2:44:39.600 --> 2:44:44.480]  is a special interest bill and it was this is being pushed by the
[2:44:44.480 --> 2:44:48.000]  foster parent consortia actually
[2:44:48.000 --> 2:44:51.680]  interestingly enough we've gotten word there's a bunch of foster parents
[2:44:51.680 --> 2:44:53.920]  groups that are actually against this bill
[2:44:53.920 --> 2:44:56.880]  well i mean by that i meant the big adoption combo
[2:44:56.880 --> 2:45:01.680]  young well also scott mcown you know the former district judge who was the
[2:45:01.680 --> 2:45:05.280]  robin had judged he's probably one of the ones who wrote it
[2:45:05.280 --> 2:45:08.880]  this was written by special interest groups who benefit from the all
[2:45:08.880 --> 2:45:12.080]  by feeding on the carcasses of the storage families
[2:45:12.080 --> 2:45:15.520]  who wrote this bill and no parent advocate
[2:45:15.520 --> 2:45:19.520]  was given any input into this bill
[2:45:19.520 --> 2:45:23.440]  so it's really a disgusting situation i've heard that the
[2:45:23.440 --> 2:45:27.280]  permanent judicial commission on children youth and families
[2:45:27.280 --> 2:45:30.160]  supports this bill and that's a piece of work in itself
[2:45:30.160 --> 2:45:34.080]  what that is is a commission where judges who hear these cases
[2:45:34.080 --> 2:45:40.160]  sit down with cps and sit down with special interest groups that benefit
[2:45:40.160 --> 2:45:44.000]  from the destruction of these families and make policy
[2:45:44.000 --> 2:45:47.360]  that's right they benefit because there's federal bounties federal money to
[2:45:47.360 --> 2:45:50.720]  grab these kids that's why they put 68 percent of them on drugs
[2:45:50.720 --> 2:45:53.600]  instantly because then it's a special needs child
[2:45:53.600 --> 2:45:58.880]  and these groups get even more money um so this is going to the governor's desk
[2:45:58.880 --> 2:46:02.480]  and the way i read it then you won't even be notified when they snatch your
[2:46:02.480 --> 2:46:06.640]  kid i mean they already do this a lot and then tell them you get to see mommy if
[2:46:06.640 --> 2:46:10.480]  you tell us mommy touched you or hurt you yeah they usually have to have an
[2:46:10.480 --> 2:46:13.760]  emergency situation when they go to the school which they can
[2:46:13.760 --> 2:46:16.640]  right now and that's what we're trying to tell people
[2:46:16.640 --> 2:46:20.800]  if there's really a kid out there that's black and blue and bleeding
[2:46:20.800 --> 2:46:24.800]  you can still take them at that moment without a hearing
[2:46:24.800 --> 2:46:29.920]  because you need to this does not take that right away from the department in
[2:46:29.920 --> 2:46:33.760]  those cases what this is this is a fishing expedition
[2:46:33.760 --> 2:46:36.800]  this is i wonder what's going on in that house
[2:46:36.800 --> 2:46:41.520]  do those people have perhaps guns i wonder
[2:46:41.520 --> 2:46:45.920]  let me tell you what all you have in my office i mean you're about the big case
[2:46:45.920 --> 2:46:50.000]  with the with the lady in in haze county yes
[2:46:50.000 --> 2:46:54.240]  and and literally they called the kids in they would send them into the
[2:46:54.240 --> 2:46:58.160]  counselor she was wearing shorts saw a bruise down her leg
[2:46:58.160 --> 2:47:01.760]  and they brought in the police and they told her don't tell your parents
[2:47:01.760 --> 2:47:05.040]  made her take her pants off look for more bruises there weren't
[2:47:05.040 --> 2:47:08.400]  and then they were going to go try to force their way into her house
[2:47:08.400 --> 2:47:12.800]  but the issue is they literally have bounties they have quotas
[2:47:12.800 --> 2:47:16.640]  and it's just so monstrous well what type of stuff have you seen jerry
[2:47:16.640 --> 2:47:20.080]  lin ward and then of course uh also uh joanna scott
[2:47:20.080 --> 2:47:23.440]  as you've been fighting this in texas i don't think the general public till they
[2:47:23.440 --> 2:47:27.280]  get hit by these people realizes just how serious this is
[2:47:27.280 --> 2:47:30.400]  well what what i've seen has been based on research and getting to know some of
[2:47:30.400 --> 2:47:32.720]  the attorneys who fight this every day and
[2:47:32.720 --> 2:47:35.760]  and as joanna said one of the big problems is they're going to use this
[2:47:35.760 --> 2:47:39.120]  to force their way into people's houses especially homeschoolers
[2:47:39.120 --> 2:47:44.000]  and a lawyer who practices in this area much more extensively than i do
[2:47:44.000 --> 2:47:48.160]  told me of an instance where cps went into a homeschoolers house
[2:47:48.160 --> 2:47:51.680]  where they actually have kids do chores instead of just go to the mall and
[2:47:51.680 --> 2:47:55.520]  sit on the couch watching tv the eight-year-old daughter was washing
[2:47:55.520 --> 2:48:00.000]  dishes the way that the cps wrote the investigative report was that
[2:48:00.000 --> 2:48:04.160]  an eight-year-old child was playing with fake knives unsupervised
[2:48:04.160 --> 2:48:07.600]  no no absolutely for those that don't know into your house
[2:48:07.600 --> 2:48:11.200]  yeah for those that don't know i have the official manual they gave janet
[2:48:11.200 --> 2:48:14.640]  here in our office for her daughter and it says if you raise your voice
[2:48:14.640 --> 2:48:18.400]  that is abuse we're going to take them there's no law saying that there's not
[2:48:18.400 --> 2:48:21.760]  even a law against spanking you just can't do serious bodily harm so they're
[2:48:21.760 --> 2:48:25.040]  creating all over the country i notice all the groups fighting cps
[2:48:25.040 --> 2:48:28.320]  are the homeschooler groups because they are hunting
[2:48:28.320 --> 2:48:31.200]  these kids they hate it they're winning all the spelling bees and getting all
[2:48:31.200 --> 2:48:35.040]  the big uh... you know awards and uh... the
[2:48:35.040 --> 2:48:39.600]  scholarships and the cps handbooks behave as if
[2:48:39.600 --> 2:48:43.120]  these are cults and they also call it slave labor
[2:48:43.120 --> 2:48:46.800]  to make your kids do chores uh... in fact under the
[2:48:46.800 --> 2:48:50.320]  u n charter of the children you're not supposed people tell your kids take the
[2:48:50.320 --> 2:48:54.480]  trash out well alex what they hate is that family
[2:48:54.480 --> 2:48:58.560]  traditionally and religiously have certain authority
[2:48:58.560 --> 2:49:02.720]  they want to take away that authority they hate these christian homeschooling
[2:49:02.720 --> 2:49:06.080]  families consider the sovereignty of god to be before
[2:49:06.080 --> 2:49:09.280]  the authority of the state they want to destroy
[2:49:09.280 --> 2:49:13.200]  families they want to bring every aspect of our lives under government
[2:49:13.200 --> 2:49:18.480]  control and this is how they do it these attorneys who who work in this system
[2:49:18.480 --> 2:49:22.240]  who are part of the advocacy for taking children away
[2:49:22.240 --> 2:49:25.760]  do not believe that that parents should have
[2:49:25.760 --> 2:49:29.040]  authority over their children this is what this is about
[2:49:29.040 --> 2:49:32.960]  yeah and this is going to destroy families is going to destroy our entire
[2:49:32.960 --> 2:49:35.680]  nation because families have always been the backbone
[2:49:35.680 --> 2:49:39.600]  of liberty absolutely absolutely i mean have you seen
[2:49:39.600 --> 2:49:44.400]  the official textbooks that they have where it calls the family mentally ill
[2:49:44.400 --> 2:49:49.040]  in a disease i've read about that no i have the textbooks we we scan them and
[2:49:49.040 --> 2:49:52.320]  put them up to prisonplanet.com people never believe it and they go
[2:49:52.320 --> 2:49:56.080]  look at it and can't that's what's taught at ut for social workers
[2:49:56.080 --> 2:49:59.200]  is that quote families belong to the age of barbarism
[2:49:59.200 --> 2:50:04.480]  and must be eradicated and most these cps workers if they're not pedophiles
[2:50:04.480 --> 2:50:08.720]  they were abused as children so they think they're punishing mommy and daddy
[2:50:08.720 --> 2:50:11.680]  they're very mentally ill
[2:50:12.080 --> 2:50:17.680]  i'm not kidding i i have seen that myself hold on hold on hold on
[2:50:17.680 --> 2:50:21.520]  this is a joanna scott you're saying you've seen that i i have actually
[2:50:21.520 --> 2:50:26.720]  watched as a very good people get into this
[2:50:26.720 --> 2:50:31.760]  field and within six months they have turned into the most
[2:50:31.760 --> 2:50:34.720]  vile and hateful people and i don't know what
[2:50:34.720 --> 2:50:38.640]  does it to them i don't know if it's what's being asked of them they either
[2:50:38.640 --> 2:50:43.600]  decide to do it or they quit but i have watched it myself the transformation
[2:50:43.600 --> 2:50:47.840]  of a case worker that comes in as a very good well-meaning person
[2:50:47.840 --> 2:50:50.800]  that's turned into a person that just destroys
[2:50:50.800 --> 2:50:53.920]  families and it well i mean they have the biggest
[2:50:53.920 --> 2:50:57.120]  will stay there they have the biggest turnover of any government job 50%
[2:50:57.120 --> 2:51:01.360]  or more and so all that gets left is just psychos

[2:54:19.360 --> 2:54:23.200]  look in the roman empire the ashtag mayan empires
[2:54:23.200 --> 2:54:30.000]  babelonian chin dynasty in china african dynasties in different regions
[2:54:30.000 --> 2:54:32.880]  they would just come kidnap children and bring them
[2:54:32.880 --> 2:54:36.400]  to be reeducated and used as usually as a slave class
[2:54:36.400 --> 2:54:40.240]  and they'd kill the adults now they just use excuses your kids got a bruise on
[2:54:40.240 --> 2:54:43.520]  their leg and uh the cps workers get
[2:54:43.520 --> 2:54:46.800]  bounties for taking them and they take them and they got kangaroo courts to do
[2:54:46.800 --> 2:54:50.640]  it and we're talking to uh lawyer jerry lin ward and
[2:54:50.640 --> 2:54:54.080]  joanna scott who heads up an advocacy group
[2:54:54.080 --> 2:54:57.040]  fighting these criminals and i know their history i know they were founded by
[2:54:57.040 --> 2:55:00.720]  the eugenesis so i understand the whole paradigm and it's it's just very very
[2:55:00.720 --> 2:55:05.600]  wicked sb 1440 to wear fishing expeditions when they
[2:55:05.600 --> 2:55:08.320]  knock at your door and you say go get a warrant
[2:55:08.320 --> 2:55:11.440]  you're not going to come in here just because you know my neighbors these tv
[2:55:11.440 --> 2:55:14.000]  ads saying kids shouldn't be playing in the backyard and
[2:55:14.000 --> 2:55:17.120]  usually it's folks go those kids need to be in school i'm calling
[2:55:17.120 --> 2:55:20.640]  because the other public's a bunch of scum as well on average now a lot of
[2:55:20.640 --> 2:55:23.920]  filth out there and uh even in wealthy neighborhoods they come
[2:55:23.920 --> 2:55:27.280]  and try to take people's kids now because they've run out of the poor kids
[2:55:27.280 --> 2:55:30.720]  plus they get more money for the you know uh well uh wealthier
[2:55:30.720 --> 2:55:34.800]  kids for some reason and um you know for the better looking kids i guess in
[2:55:34.800 --> 2:55:38.240]  some cases uh and it's just abs i mean you cannot
[2:55:38.240 --> 2:55:43.120]  make up stuff as bad as what reality is it's it's so off the charts
[2:55:43.120 --> 2:55:48.160]  jerry lin ward joanna scott other points need to be made about
[2:55:48.160 --> 2:55:53.760]  it seems as if uh these federalized child kidnappers are really starting to get
[2:55:53.760 --> 2:55:57.360]  exposed so their response is to try to pass a
[2:55:57.360 --> 2:56:01.360]  bunch of unconstitutional laws nationwide and go after kids even more
[2:56:01.360 --> 2:56:04.560]  like oh you don't want to stay in your kids for no reason
[2:56:04.560 --> 2:56:08.880]  okay well get ready for this so it seems the battle is really on now can you
[2:56:08.880 --> 2:56:13.280]  comment on that well i think that's exactly right when whenever
[2:56:13.280 --> 2:56:17.200]  you try to trim the powers of a governmental agency
[2:56:17.200 --> 2:56:21.440]  i whereby impacting those who benefit from what that
[2:56:21.440 --> 2:56:24.560]  you know economically benefit from what that agency does
[2:56:24.560 --> 2:56:28.560]  you're going to see all sorts of attempts to get around
[2:56:28.560 --> 2:56:33.200]  the court's decisions about how to trim their power that's just the nature
[2:56:33.200 --> 2:56:35.840]  of government and it's especially the nature of government
[2:56:35.840 --> 2:56:40.320]  where you've got other groups like these groups that benefit
[2:56:40.320 --> 2:56:43.760]  from giving services to family or taking kids around
[2:56:43.760 --> 2:56:50.160]  trying to push back how clearly how did you first get mad jerry i mean you
[2:56:50.160 --> 2:56:52.880]  first just uh how does you first learn about this
[2:56:52.880 --> 2:56:57.120]  i first learned about it when they took those kids out in el dorado and i
[2:56:57.120 --> 2:57:01.600]  couldn't sleep for three nights and so i started calling
[2:57:01.600 --> 2:57:05.280]  to find out how i could help and it ended up that not many lawyers were
[2:57:05.280 --> 2:57:09.040]  volunteering to help the fathers so i helped
[2:57:09.040 --> 2:57:13.440]  one of the fathers and then i entered into the borrow world
[2:57:13.440 --> 2:57:17.600]  i the first hearing i went to was on the the
[2:57:17.600 --> 2:57:22.320]  the services plan and i put on or i cross examined
[2:57:22.320 --> 2:57:25.760]  the case worker who admitted in front of the judge
[2:57:25.760 --> 2:57:29.280]  that there was no evidence of abuse and neglect i made a motion for them to
[2:57:29.280 --> 2:57:33.760]  dismiss the case and they didn't do it to me that's bizarre
[2:57:33.760 --> 2:57:36.880]  that's where i met jerry i've had that hearing
[2:57:36.880 --> 2:57:40.560]  that's right no evidence and they still take your kids we only got five minutes

[3:01:07.280 --> 3:01:13.120]  the best senator what a lot of what a besmirching of the texas monthly
[3:01:13.120 --> 3:01:17.520]  these people think they're saving children they don't really understand
[3:01:17.520 --> 3:01:22.800]  or care evidently about the trauma that a child goes through when strangers come
[3:01:22.800 --> 3:01:27.520]  and ask did daddy touch your pee pee do you do this or that at home these
[3:01:27.520 --> 3:01:30.800]  strangers come take their clothes off and look at them
[3:01:30.800 --> 3:01:34.320]  give them medical exams this only should be happening when you
[3:01:34.320 --> 3:01:40.640]  know they they do the ladies a child who works here and then they lied about it
[3:01:40.640 --> 3:01:43.600]  and even the statesman writer said no first they admitted they did it then
[3:01:43.600 --> 3:01:47.440]  they said they didn't the end of the statesman caught them lying
[3:01:47.440 --> 3:01:50.240]  they they strip search little girls and do whatever they want
[3:01:50.240 --> 3:01:54.640]  yeah i just got while we were sitting here i just got on my email my
[3:01:54.640 --> 3:01:58.080]  little update i'm on the department's update
[3:01:58.080 --> 3:02:01.920]  and children waiting for adoption i pop up my email
[3:02:01.920 --> 3:02:07.600]  all the new kids up for adoption just popped up on my screen
[3:02:07.600 --> 3:02:11.840]  that's what this is about yeah all the new kids they've snatched yeah
[3:02:11.840 --> 3:02:14.880]  the best way to protect children is to protect
[3:02:14.880 --> 3:02:18.240]  dupe the due process rights of their parents yes
[3:02:18.240 --> 3:02:22.400]  and ultimately then because this is just a slippery slope
[3:02:22.400 --> 3:02:26.080]  yes and nobody's going to have any rights if we keep on
[3:02:26.080 --> 3:02:30.000]  in this direction putting you back on the cps i mean
[3:02:30.000 --> 3:02:33.920]  the record they've got of abusing children this is the worst place you'd
[3:02:33.920 --> 3:02:37.200]  want children to be period right what about them being investigated
[3:02:37.200 --> 3:02:40.800]  for a change because we know where all the smart pedophiles go they don't go to
[3:02:40.800 --> 3:02:43.440]  parks to grab kids they go become cps workers
[3:02:43.440 --> 3:02:47.680]  yeah well they they're always covering that and we bring that up all the time
[3:02:47.680 --> 3:02:51.840]  but um there are national studies that have been done that should prove
[3:02:51.840 --> 3:02:55.920]  that if you actually even left the really abused kids in their homes they'd
[3:02:55.920 --> 3:02:58.720]  actually be abused less in their home than they would be in the foster care
[3:02:58.720 --> 3:03:03.440]  system well i mean look i was a car cleaner for one summer and i saw
[3:03:03.440 --> 3:03:07.840]  cps homes and let me tell you something it's held
[3:03:07.840 --> 3:03:10.960]  and you can take one look at the people running them and you're like oh my god
[3:03:10.960 --> 3:03:16.400]  that's a deal but even you're right but even i'm here to say that even
[3:03:16.400 --> 3:03:21.760]  in the best supposedly good home with good well-meaning people that actually
[3:03:21.760 --> 3:03:25.360]  treat a child correctly it's still a stranger
[3:03:25.360 --> 3:03:30.800]  it's still a trauma it totally fries the kids and they want to break the family

[3:08:50.320 --> 3:08:53.360]  it and then you can burn them good when they're
[3:08:53.360 --> 3:08:56.720]  violating the bill of rights and constitution or save yourself when

[3:11:23.680 --> 3:11:27.840]  medicated you know doctors said you know this not going on take these drugs and
[3:11:27.840 --> 3:11:30.560]  and forget about all of it so your parents said
[3:11:30.560 --> 3:11:33.440]  my god he's mentally ill he believes there's a corrupt elite he believes
[3:11:33.440 --> 3:11:36.160]  there's a federal reserve he's he's a criminal we've got a
[3:11:36.160 --> 3:11:38.960]  drugging well it was more so you were already awake
[3:11:38.960 --> 3:11:42.560]  i was i was already awake and then a thought criminal yes i was a thought
[3:11:42.560 --> 3:11:46.160]  criminal and then for 10 years i was i was heavily medicated
[3:11:46.160 --> 3:11:50.000]  uh until you know i always knew deep down something was going on
[3:11:50.000 --> 3:11:54.880]  and uh i started researching the microchip on peer-to-peer networks this is
[3:11:54.880 --> 3:11:58.640]  well before there's anything like youtube or or these types of streaming
[3:11:58.640 --> 3:12:01.280]  video sites i came across a video of you talking
[3:12:01.280 --> 3:12:05.600]  about the rfid chip the very chip uh and i said who is this guy what's he
[3:12:05.600 --> 3:12:09.040]  talking about i mean he's he's what i was talking about before it wasn't
[3:12:09.040 --> 3:12:11.920]  just a just some line that i read in a book
[3:12:11.920 --> 3:12:15.520]  and i started doing some more searching found your name uh saw a video of you
[3:12:15.520 --> 3:12:18.560]  at the sea world you know talking about biometrics
[3:12:18.560 --> 3:12:21.600]  there's actually one from 2000 and another from 2004
[3:12:21.600 --> 3:12:24.880]  as people get those confused but yeah they put the biometrics in
[3:12:24.880 --> 3:12:28.400]  yeah so i watched the video and i said look this guy right here
[3:12:28.400 --> 3:12:32.160]  he is talking the exact same thing that i'm talking about i'm not crazy
[3:12:32.160 --> 3:12:35.680]  okay so before you thought you were crazy and they medicated you
[3:12:35.680 --> 3:12:39.840]  and then years later you're seeing no it's real it's really happening so it's
[3:12:39.840 --> 3:12:43.440]  really so so i i didn't really wake you up i just validated what you already
[3:12:43.440 --> 3:12:45.840]  knew well yeah i mean you had validated what i
[3:12:45.840 --> 3:12:49.520]  knew but you reignited that that spark that needed that was their dwelling
[3:12:49.520 --> 3:12:53.360]  inside me and i said okay it's it's time
[3:12:53.360 --> 3:12:56.880]  you know let's let's organize you know i downloaded all your movies
[3:12:56.880 --> 3:13:00.400]  you know i sat in a basement watched them all emerged from the in from the
[3:13:00.400 --> 3:13:04.720]  darkness uh and i'm in a new light shown upon me and i was like
[3:13:04.720 --> 3:13:08.160]  where is everybody we gotta find everybody let's get organized let's take
[3:13:08.160 --> 3:13:11.520]  action and that's when the uh lone lantern society was created
[3:13:11.520 --> 3:13:13.760]  explain the lone lantern means for those that don't
[3:13:13.760 --> 3:13:18.160]  lone lantern is the uh it is the the single lantern in the virtual tower
[3:13:18.160 --> 3:13:22.320]  and uh telling people that the enemies are here it's it's taken after the
[3:13:22.320 --> 3:13:26.000]  midnight ride of paul revere were one if i land two if i see well
[3:13:26.000 --> 3:13:29.280]  the one the enemies here yeah they are here they're on our soil and is up to
[3:13:29.280 --> 3:13:32.560]  us to ride through the streets and wake up the american people and that's
[3:13:32.560 --> 3:13:36.240]  what the lone lantern society was created to do
[3:13:36.240 --> 3:13:39.280]  and then you got to work with erin russo and then when he died right as he died
[3:13:39.280 --> 3:13:42.160]  he handed over restore the republic and you've done a great job
[3:13:42.160 --> 3:13:45.440]  keeping that alive yeah the lone lantern society erin saw what i was doing
[3:13:45.440 --> 3:13:48.320]  in chicago with the lone lantern society and he said you know
[3:13:48.320 --> 3:13:51.360]  he we met on several occasions you know had some really wild late night
[3:13:51.360 --> 3:13:54.400]  conversations uh in his suite at the uh host
[3:13:54.400 --> 3:13:58.320]  a sofa tell hotel you know those late night 3am conversations
[3:13:58.320 --> 3:14:02.240]  philosophy and and the the meaning of life it was just amazing and uh
[3:14:02.240 --> 3:14:05.600]  you know we developed a bond and trust i work behind the scenes we had a lot of
[3:14:05.600 --> 3:14:08.880]  energy while he was even fighting for his life oh he sure did a total of six
[3:14:08.880 --> 3:14:11.840]  years he fought cancer yes he didn't tell people about it to the very end
[3:14:11.840 --> 3:14:15.520]  that's right and you know that movie was his uh was his his final message to the
[3:14:15.520 --> 3:14:20.560]  people and uh it really catapulted a movement it catapulted ron paul
[3:14:20.560 --> 3:14:24.400]  um you know and then we had all these people who'd seen the film we needed to
[3:14:24.400 --> 3:14:29.200]  to to harness the energy that was created and that's where the restore the
[3:14:29.200 --> 3:14:33.600]  republic organization came in now that's just wonderful and it's another
[3:14:33.600 --> 3:14:36.320]  testament though you took action you got involved
[3:14:36.320 --> 3:14:39.040]  and you've conservatively with your work and the volunteers reach millions of
[3:14:39.040 --> 3:14:42.720]  people uh and it's so exciting i mean all
[3:14:42.720 --> 3:14:46.000]  these scores of universities it's making the news that they're taking the
[3:14:46.000 --> 3:14:50.400]  obama deception and making copies of it this film has been out three months
[3:14:50.400 --> 3:14:53.840]  over 15 million views i quit counting online probably way more than that now
[3:14:53.840 --> 3:14:58.000]  that was a month ago that was two months in so three months and i don't know
[3:14:58.000 --> 3:15:01.040]  what it is uh all over the place you'll read in the
[3:15:01.040 --> 3:15:04.480]  newspaper 15 000 obama deceptions where they burn copies in
[3:15:04.480 --> 3:15:07.280]  hand amount same thing with america freedom to fascism
[3:15:07.280 --> 3:15:10.880]  so now george soros is funding things like the home project
[3:15:10.880 --> 3:15:14.560]  humans are bad gotta have carbon taxes gotta have one-child policies
[3:15:14.560 --> 3:15:18.400]  humans are evil and they're saying give them out for free have street actions
[3:15:18.400 --> 3:15:22.320]  they're now trying to duplicate what we're doing because we're engaged in a
[3:15:22.320 --> 3:15:26.240]  real color revolution against outside bankers coming in and taking over our
[3:15:26.240 --> 3:15:28.640]  country they're trying now to come in with a false
[3:15:28.640 --> 3:15:32.560]  obama revolution but that's sputtering down very quickly
[3:15:32.560 --> 3:15:35.200]  they're even admitting that they can't get their 13 million volunteers do
[3:15:35.200 --> 3:15:38.800]  anything because they're finding out barack obama is a corporate front
[3:15:38.800 --> 3:15:42.800]  so again this doesn't have to happen can you believe that they're openly
[3:15:42.800 --> 3:15:47.040]  announcing la times washington times washington post i've read those articles
[3:15:47.040 --> 3:15:51.040]  earlier in the show just saying yes private offshore banks will run the
[3:15:51.040 --> 3:15:54.800]  whole government any industry no court no judge no jury
[3:15:54.800 --> 3:15:58.720]  they'll grab your business from a hot dog stand to a car dealership
[3:15:58.720 --> 3:16:02.080]  we rule everything you're going to pay carbon taxes
[3:16:02.080 --> 3:16:07.200]  they're now introduced the bill i mean it's not enough they've raped us a 14.8
[3:16:07.200 --> 3:16:11.680]  trillion gary francy well you know these people are reckless they're out of
[3:16:11.680 --> 3:16:15.040]  control and they need to be checked you know that's why
[3:16:15.040 --> 3:16:18.080]  their message is falling through the cracks that's why the people their
[3:16:18.080 --> 3:16:20.240]  volunteers aren't picking up the ball and running with it
[3:16:20.240 --> 3:16:23.760]  because they have lies their their house is built upon
[3:16:23.760 --> 3:16:27.520]  sand it will crumble okay our house is built upon the truth
[3:16:27.520 --> 3:16:30.480]  and that is why we are successful that's why our message
[3:16:30.480 --> 3:16:35.440]  proliferates the way it does my landlord came to my house to pick up a check
[3:16:35.440 --> 3:16:38.640]  you know what he said he had me a copy of the obama deception
[3:16:38.640 --> 3:16:42.320]  and i said i didn't know that yeah he's i said all you've seen you know and we
[3:16:42.320 --> 3:16:46.000]  got a long conversation about it it was pretty interesting so i mean
[3:16:46.000 --> 3:16:49.200]  people that i'm eating every day are handing me stuff now and that's well
[3:16:49.200 --> 3:16:52.400]  listen i don't brag when i say this is actually freaks me out and then i want
[3:16:52.400 --> 3:16:55.120]  to take off and go eat a hamburger i want to take my wife to a movie and i
[3:16:55.120 --> 3:16:57.040]  physically tell her sorry i gotta stay at work
[3:16:57.040 --> 3:17:00.080]  it's becoming a because i know we don't have much time i know
[3:17:00.080 --> 3:17:02.880]  we're hitting them out of the park but just because we're in a machine gun that's
[3:17:02.880 --> 3:17:04.960]  hitting the enemy we're still getting blown to hell
[3:17:04.960 --> 3:17:08.640]  so i can't walk away for one minute for my children but then i do take off three
[3:17:08.640 --> 3:17:11.920]  days and go to port aransas every restaurant we went to
[3:17:11.920 --> 3:17:15.680]  the people that owned it ran it it wasn't just one guy would be here's the
[3:17:15.680 --> 3:17:18.560]  owner here's the manager here's my wife i'm a fan
[3:17:18.560 --> 3:17:22.480]  you know when you sign this film for us you know you know i mean and then go to
[3:17:22.480 --> 3:17:25.760]  the next restaurant and i'm going on the beach in a rented golf cart
[3:17:25.760 --> 3:17:30.160]  pass the cars and alex jones alex jones we have really heard them bad gary we
[3:17:30.160 --> 3:17:32.800]  really have i mean but the thing is they're just coming down on us and
[3:17:32.800 --> 3:17:35.120]  don't care so i mean what do you think what do you see
[3:17:35.120 --> 3:17:38.960]  happening in all this well you know like i said it's it's the truth it's the
[3:17:38.960 --> 3:17:43.200]  message that is piercing the the darkness okay
[3:17:43.200 --> 3:17:47.040]  you know anything that is done in darkness anything that is hidden in secret
[3:17:47.040 --> 3:17:50.720]  will be revealed and that is why we are being successful
[3:17:50.720 --> 3:17:53.760]  it's because people believe in what we're doing and it's and it's having an
[3:17:53.760 --> 3:17:57.520]  impact the people are waking up by the by the millions alex by the millions
[3:17:57.520 --> 3:18:00.320]  the new world order does not stand a chance against the truth
[3:18:00.320 --> 3:18:03.360]  if we're willing to spend the problem is they're getting desperate now and
[3:18:03.360 --> 3:18:07.360]  saying and saying this you know aclu on their front page has the official
[3:18:07.360 --> 3:18:10.960]  pentagon training mail that says all protest is now terrorism
[3:18:10.960 --> 3:18:14.160]  i mean it actually says we're all terrorists right it's the first
[3:18:14.160 --> 3:18:18.080]  amendment it's america but the veterans fought and died for they're saying the
[3:18:18.080 --> 3:18:21.120]  veterans are terrorist gun owners are terrorist
[3:18:21.120 --> 3:18:24.080]  i mean folks the government is the terrorist
[3:18:24.080 --> 3:18:28.400]  they're the illegitimate bastards they are grasping at straws at this point
[3:18:28.400 --> 3:18:32.640]  because they cannot control the messages they try to the internet is their
[3:18:32.640 --> 3:18:34.800]  worst enemy and now they're saying they're going to shut it down
[3:18:34.800 --> 3:18:38.000]  well you imagine when they try that all these dvds are already out there we're
[3:18:38.000 --> 3:18:40.720]  going to use fax machines they can't arrest us all
[3:18:40.720 --> 3:18:43.360]  and they start trying to take people off to fema camps gary you know what's
[3:18:43.360 --> 3:18:46.160]  going to happen and that's what i don't want to go to but you know what
[3:18:46.160 --> 3:18:49.200]  if it goes to that gary do these cops have any idea what's going to happen to
[3:18:49.200 --> 3:18:53.200]  them well i you know there's the cops out there the
[3:18:53.200 --> 3:18:57.600]  swat guys they're americans too and those are the guys we need to reach
[3:18:57.600 --> 3:19:00.320]  you know because they're the ones that gonna follow those orders and we have
[3:19:00.320 --> 3:19:04.320]  to reach them before it's too late alex we have to we have to hit the police the
[3:19:04.320 --> 3:19:07.600]  fire all of those first responder type people
[3:19:07.600 --> 3:19:10.640]  because if we can if we can build up the resistance within
[3:19:10.640 --> 3:19:14.400]  we have we are yeah we are we will yeah i mean i'm too hard on a lot of them
[3:19:14.400 --> 3:19:17.600]  because the media loves to show only the bad cops and people and i figured out a
[3:19:17.600 --> 3:19:20.400]  few years ago that when i was hyping that up and i still do it because it
[3:19:20.400 --> 3:19:23.760]  threatens me in a primitive level that actually makes the cops then get more
[3:19:23.760 --> 3:19:27.120]  isolated from us we're more isolated from them
[3:19:27.120 --> 3:19:31.280]  but then you have to when when the when the oklahoma highway patrol defends the
[3:19:31.280 --> 3:19:33.520]  guy who almost runs the ambulance off the road
[3:19:33.520 --> 3:19:37.280]  and then jumps out and starts roughing the guys up and then they say he's the
[3:19:37.280 --> 3:19:41.360]  bad guy the ambulance guy's bad i mean that is the system
[3:19:41.360 --> 3:19:45.440]  fundamentally run by bad people well it there's there has been you know
[3:19:45.440 --> 3:19:49.680]  brainwashing power trips you know ingrained in a lot of these guys
[3:19:49.680 --> 3:19:53.040]  they think they're terminators walking around when that's been done so they
[3:19:53.040 --> 3:19:56.800]  can be used in an evil job cops you better break yourselves out of them
[3:19:56.800 --> 3:19:59.840]  out of the mind control you're in because i know what i'm saying is true
[3:19:59.840 --> 3:20:04.320]  and so does gary with food prices soaring to all-time highs

[3:24:26.000 --> 3:24:29.440]  it's the best of times it was the worst of times as a famous
[3:24:29.440 --> 3:24:33.760]  literary mind said and it is and i guess the best in this comes out when
[3:24:33.760 --> 3:24:36.640]  things start getting the worst but also the worst in this comes out
[3:24:36.640 --> 3:24:40.080]  and i mean i keep going over this and over this to have them
[3:24:40.080 --> 3:24:43.600]  openly announcing a bank of the world but then i thought they were going to
[3:24:43.600 --> 3:24:46.320]  run us out of the bank of the world through the executive they're saying
[3:24:46.320 --> 3:24:49.520]  no the banks will actually rule the federal government
[3:24:49.520 --> 3:24:53.200]  with government power so this is like a fourth branch of government above it a
[3:24:53.200 --> 3:24:55.680]  new form of government in the united states
[3:24:55.680 --> 3:24:59.440]  openly being announced not with a bang gary it's just being
[3:24:59.440 --> 3:25:02.720]  let you know like slipped out like somebody does something in church
[3:25:02.720 --> 3:25:07.200]  you mean like a global banking system over the federal reserve is that we're
[3:25:07.200 --> 3:25:10.080]  talking about yep but but actually running government
[3:25:10.080 --> 3:25:13.760]  functions and commanding the pentagon and the executive and it's above
[3:25:13.760 --> 3:25:17.040]  government well that's the new order that is what they've been working for for
[3:25:17.040 --> 3:25:19.680]  the past eighty one hundred but i mean they're missed
[3:25:19.680 --> 3:25:22.720]  they're skipping ahead of three or four more steps they're going
[3:25:22.720 --> 3:25:25.920]  right to the end because they don't have the time
[3:25:25.920 --> 3:25:29.040]  because we're waking people up faster than they can go ahead and and develop
[3:25:29.040 --> 3:25:32.880]  the system their plan although all along has been incremental steps
[3:25:32.880 --> 3:25:36.000]  and now because we are pushing out the information at the at the rate that we
[3:25:36.000 --> 3:25:39.760]  are they have to amp up their game and that's why you're seeing the speed and
[3:25:39.760 --> 3:25:43.200]  and and then the the new order developing at this rate
[3:25:43.200 --> 3:25:47.120]  no i agree with you and they decided to go from the soft tyranny
[3:25:47.120 --> 3:25:50.960]  to an open tyranny and they've said that in the financial times of one they said
[3:25:50.960 --> 3:25:54.720]  we are authoritarian but this is good i mean they are saying they're
[3:25:54.720 --> 3:25:58.800]  authoritarian i mean i keep repeating it they are
[3:25:58.800 --> 3:26:02.160]  illegitimate gary so what do we do you know we're pushing people so they want
[3:26:02.160 --> 3:26:06.240]  solutions states rights not not succession we're saying
[3:26:06.240 --> 3:26:09.200]  states created the federal government ninth and tenth amendment
[3:26:09.200 --> 3:26:11.680]  we're saying we're not going to follow your unconstitutional stuff we're going
[3:26:11.680 --> 3:26:14.560]  to get you back under control because the feds have been seized by offshore
[3:26:14.560 --> 3:26:17.840]  corporations the states have got to come back and get control

[3:38:14.320 --> 3:38:17.360]  we just even sure was on a week ago i tried to get through
[3:38:17.360 --> 3:38:21.920]  he said well his barack obama's mother's american i don't understand what the
[3:38:21.920 --> 3:38:25.680]  problem is here's what the problem is the father wasn't but even bigger than
[3:38:25.680 --> 3:38:29.840]  that you have to go back to the law that was in 1961 i believe
[3:38:29.840 --> 3:38:34.960]  and that said if you're uh... you're one parent is natural born here's the
[3:38:34.960 --> 3:38:38.400]  deal you have to live here in over the last ten years
[3:38:38.400 --> 3:38:41.520]  of which five have to be over the age of fourteen
[3:38:41.520 --> 3:38:45.840]  now she gave her mother was too young to have been able to do that yes so
[3:38:45.840 --> 3:38:49.440]  he's not a citizen who can be president
[3:38:49.440 --> 3:38:53.680]  because his mother under federal law had not lived in the united states
[3:38:53.680 --> 3:38:57.760]  continuously for long enough now she lived here continuously
[3:38:57.760 --> 3:39:01.520]  but five of those years had to be over the age of fourteen
[3:39:01.520 --> 3:39:05.280]  which meant she could have given birth out of the country
[3:39:05.280 --> 3:39:09.200]  five years after we read you know she was too young for it to be young
[3:39:09.200 --> 3:39:13.760]  yeah yeah she she gave birth at age 18 the other disagreement and i got this
[3:39:13.760 --> 3:39:17.840]  information to air on the other day with the code word batman in his email

[3:49:48.560 --> 3:49:52.880]  all without question because that is ace that they can suck money out of he's

[3:54:21.360 --> 3:54:24.400]  guys could comment on their recent declaration of the world health
[3:54:24.400 --> 3:54:29.680]  organization um using u.s schools as mandatory vaccination centers and
[3:54:29.680 --> 3:54:33.440]  how you think they're gonna um enforce that are they gonna send people like a
[3:54:33.440 --> 3:54:37.040]  letter or something or well i should have spent more time on this since they
[3:54:37.040 --> 3:54:42.320]  came out and said that on uh monday but see that's a blind spot i have is that i
[3:54:42.320 --> 3:54:46.000]  read the official un treaty that we signed
[3:54:46.000 --> 3:54:49.280]  we me and jason showed it over and over again months ago on air where it says
[3:54:49.280 --> 3:54:53.680]  forced inoculations martial law uh how they're going to use the schools as
[3:54:53.680 --> 3:54:58.560]  forced inoculations the model states health emergency powers act from 2002
[3:54:58.560 --> 3:55:03.440]  2003 said all that and so we've told we told you we were really at level six a
[3:55:03.440 --> 3:55:07.120]  month and a half ago this week they admitted that and people still say we're
[3:55:07.120 --> 3:55:09.680]  not at level six even when it's in roiders and ap
[3:55:09.680 --> 3:55:13.360]  yeah the flu isn't real but it's their height
[3:55:13.360 --> 3:55:16.880]  to bring in international control and yes we're now under
[3:55:16.880 --> 3:55:21.680]  un regulation and control and the head of health and human services is saying
[3:55:21.680 --> 3:55:23.840]  they're going to forcibly inject your kids
[3:55:23.840 --> 3:55:27.040]  at the schools and it's absolutely hellish
[3:55:27.040 --> 3:55:31.920]  and uh i mean the only thing i can say that can be done is you have to
[3:55:31.920 --> 3:55:36.400]  reject uh those vaccinations you know stand on your constitution push the
[3:55:36.400 --> 3:55:39.520]  constitution as hard as you can the school will lie
[3:55:39.520 --> 3:55:43.040]  i mean i've got video of the police in maryland saying it's the law with police
[3:55:43.040 --> 3:55:45.760]  dogs barking at the kids to make them take the shot
[3:55:45.760 --> 3:55:48.880]  and then i had the state attorney on the lap said yeah my kids don't take it
[3:55:48.880 --> 3:55:53.520]  he the guy doing it that i got off cnn was laughing at us on air
[3:55:53.520 --> 3:55:56.960]  about how stupid those people are it's funny to them
[3:55:56.960 --> 3:56:02.400]  lawless people well like i said you you have to stand on religious or
[3:56:02.400 --> 3:56:06.560]  philosophical objection and fight it as hard as you can i mean that's that's
[3:56:06.560 --> 3:56:09.840]  the only recourse we have at this time you don't trust the government gary you
[3:56:09.840 --> 3:56:12.240]  shouldn't i mean they only irradiated all those foster
[3:56:12.240 --> 3:56:14.960]  kids and gave black men syphilis and thousands of other things you
[3:56:14.960 --> 3:56:18.240]  you don't want to take the injections gary well you know i've had enough
[3:56:18.240 --> 3:56:22.400]  mercury throughout my life to uh problem is you had had enough
[3:56:22.400 --> 3:56:25.680]  you'd start loving government and realize it made the sun come up
[3:56:25.680 --> 3:56:29.200]  it makes the grass grow well i was hoping i get some more fluoride treatments
[3:56:29.200 --> 3:56:32.480]  you know where personally you know where easter eggs come from the president
[3:56:32.480 --> 3:56:34.880]  lays them that's what i thought chocolate candy eggs
[3:56:34.880 --> 3:56:39.120]  i heard about that you know you need more medication you learn to
[3:56:39.120 --> 3:56:41.760]  enjoy those
[3:56:43.120 --> 3:56:45.920]  the little obama eggs
[3:56:47.600 --> 3:56:50.400]  and and and and people think when he gets on the commode
[3:56:50.400 --> 3:56:53.680]  that it's not chocolate eggs they're with al-qaeda oh the groom of the stool
[3:56:53.680 --> 3:56:57.440]  right yeah
[3:56:57.440 --> 3:57:01.440]  all right francey you're out of control let's take one more call
[3:57:01.440 --> 3:57:05.280]  you know it's all happening here uh let's talk to
[3:57:05.280 --> 3:57:09.760]  roger in minnesota go ahead roger uh yes i have a question i'd like to ask
[3:57:09.760 --> 3:57:13.200]  both of you i'm sure you both have heard of the gentleman michael to sari and i
[3:57:13.200 --> 3:57:16.160]  don't know if i pronounce his name correctly yeah i've had him on i didn't
[3:57:16.160 --> 3:57:19.840]  know a lot about him uh interesting intelligent fellow i don't
[3:57:19.840 --> 3:57:24.960]  think i agree with some of his religious ideas uh but uh interesting
[3:57:24.960 --> 3:57:28.000]  information yeah well my question is he one of the
[3:57:28.000 --> 3:57:31.520]  things he says that he thinks the constitution is a fraud and of course
[3:57:31.520 --> 3:57:35.360]  that's kind of a big thing to know whether it is or isn't and
[3:57:35.360 --> 3:57:39.200]  well i mean it's a better system than the others and anything can be perverted
[3:57:39.200 --> 3:57:41.920]  but uh no it's bill rights constitution
[3:57:41.920 --> 3:57:45.760]  uh amazing of the founding fathers really did believe in liberty and freedom
[3:57:45.760 --> 3:57:49.600]  and a lot of people attack them and i don't think he does it out of meanness
[3:57:49.600 --> 3:57:53.120]  certainly it's not perfect and there were different factions in there
[3:57:53.120 --> 3:57:56.640]  uh but uh it's produced more wealth and more liberty than any other system and
[3:57:56.640 --> 3:58:00.080]  i stand behind it and the other thing i just wanted to mention is uh
[3:58:00.080 --> 3:58:03.840]  ron paul has on his website uh really good analysis today
[3:58:03.840 --> 3:58:07.520]  of uh of the uh health care bill that obama's trying to get past yeah we're
