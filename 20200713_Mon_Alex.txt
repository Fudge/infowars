[00:00.000 --> 00:24.800]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want to stop tyranny well so does he live from the info wars.com studios it's Alex Jones
[00:24.800 --> 00:33.760]  Ladies and gentlemen, let's go to this vital John Bowne report BLM is a globalist occupying force that you can't fight or your racists. Here it is
[00:33.760 --> 00:39.760]  What are you doing?
[00:39.760 --> 00:43.760]  I just told you what I was what are you what are you in question?
[00:43.760 --> 00:45.760]  Every way you go you would think you're a great father killer.
[00:45.760 --> 00:49.760]  Then you steal people's clothes and then you have to have a hand to fight. Where is our rapper race?
[00:49.760 --> 00:55.760]  Anti-black racism is not only happening in the United States. It's actually happening all across the globe.
[00:55.760 --> 01:05.760]  And what we need now more than ever is a human rights movement that challenges systemic racism in every single context.
[01:05.760 --> 01:07.760]  The white people may have to die. You stick with them.
[01:07.760 --> 01:11.760]  Yeah, I'm confused on why that's so controversial.
[01:11.760 --> 01:24.760]  This anti-police rhetoric sweeping the country has turned out some hateful things inside of people that are now playing themselves out on the American police officer.
[01:24.760 --> 01:26.760]  What is Black Lives Matter?
[01:26.760 --> 01:36.760]  To the average unsuspecting American they have presented themselves as the enemies of liberty, enemies of private property and enemies of the rule of law.
[01:36.760 --> 01:42.760]  The sway Black Lives Matter has over our country right now has become that of an occupying force.
[01:42.760 --> 01:54.760]  And I pointed out because I'd gone to the Black Lives Matter website that they were Marxists. It looked like the Planks came from the Communist Manifesto. They were talking about overthrowing the state.
[01:54.760 --> 02:01.760]  And at that time I said that Black Lives Matter was a destructive force in our society and it was a problem.
[02:01.760 --> 02:10.760]  And I caught a lot of grief for saying that. Now the founders of Black Lives Matter they've come out. They've come out as Marxists.
[02:10.760 --> 02:20.760]  I also think that it might, the first thing I think is that we actually do have an ideological frame. Myself and Alicia in particular are trained organizers.
[02:20.760 --> 02:24.760]  We are trained Marxists.
[02:24.760 --> 02:41.760]  And Black Lives Matter is supported by forces that would like nothing more than to occupy the United States in some way, shape or form. Soros is largely unchallenged social manipulation maneuvers via the Open Society Foundation's engineers Black Lives Matter.
[02:41.760 --> 02:52.760]  As the Daily Caller wrote, one of the group's biggest donors is the Tides Foundation, a nonprofit funded by billionaire progressive philanthropist George Soros.
[02:52.760 --> 03:07.760]  Communist Hollywood propagandizing China supports Black Lives Matter, Silicon Valley and the United Nations support Black Lives Matter, and of course sycophantic globalist corporate wannabe overlords support Black Lives Matter.
[03:07.760 --> 03:19.760]  And who can forget when the Moronic Democrats paraded their pseudo solidarity by unwittingly wearing the African scarves identified with a slave industry African nation.
[03:19.760 --> 03:32.760]  While the entertainment of the left celebrates Black Lives Matter only to face the facts, once their beloved Hamilton is revealed to actually be a celebration of the very people they despise.
[03:32.760 --> 03:52.760]  Black Lives Matter is merely a successful catchphrase to strengthen the planks of communism that already exists in the United States in varying degrees, a violent creeping political statement ignited by the Weather Underground's anti-imperialism prairie fire documents of the early 1970s,
[03:52.760 --> 04:04.760]  which has morphed into the Antifa and BLM of today. As the Gateway Pundit reported, violent domestic terrorist Bill Ayers is officially linked to Antifa through his group, Refused Fascism.
[04:04.760 --> 04:13.760]  Refused Fascism, a fascist organization that wishes to inhibit and deny the speech of conservatives, is partly funded by George Soros.
[04:13.760 --> 04:23.760]  It has organizers like Bill Ayers and it is targeting youth across the country with the intention of indoctrinating and brainwashing individuals who nascent politically.
[04:23.760 --> 04:37.760]  Though it arrived with hushed overtones from the leftist media rather than a bold announcement, Black Lives Matter revealed their ridiculous demands and it reads like a modern-day Weather Underground communist takeover.
[04:37.760 --> 04:49.760]  Judge this movement by its fruit, a tree rooted in treason withering with death and hate. John Bounds reporting.
[04:49.760 --> 04:58.760]  Ladies and gentlemen, I am absolutely loaded for bear today. We'll be right back on Alex Jones, your host, please, for the word.
[04:58.760 --> 05:11.760]  Many reasons that the globalist launch this planetary lockdown. The number one reason is it serves every one of their purposes. We've gone over those purposes many times here on air.
[05:11.760 --> 05:17.760]  The casual society, the surveillance system, global government, medical tyranny, forced inoculation.
[05:17.760 --> 05:33.760]  But the most important facet is it teaches us that we are obsolete, that we are non-essential as we begin to witness automation computers and robots take over the jobs that people once had by design.
[05:33.760 --> 05:54.760]  This isn't like it's some advancement that we just fell into. It's been pre-planned, organized globally, and it's extremely predatory. And through governmental actuaries and tax programs and regulations, the central banks that control it all are able to pick the winners and the losers and consolidate power.
[05:54.760 --> 06:17.760]  This is the truest form of technocracy fascism.
[06:17.760 --> 06:29.760]  Thank you for joining us with 112 days out from the election. It is Monday, July 13th. The year is 2020. I am your host, Alex Jones. We're going to be here myself for the next four hours live.
[06:29.760 --> 06:39.760]  And we're going to open the phones up throughout the entire broadcast to take your phone calls. Ladies and gentlemen, thank you so much for joining us on this live Monday edition.
[06:39.760 --> 06:59.760]  Okay. Everything is going into high gear. We have big news on the Jerry, Jeffrey Epstein, Gisling Maxwell, Pedophile Front. We have massive COVID-19 intensifying lockdown news coming up as Trump finally takes the gloves off and begins to really expose what a compromised fraud
[06:59.760 --> 07:14.760]  Fauci, who's been at the NIH for over 40 years as a globalist operative is. You don't just argue with him about his fake facts. You destroy and discredit him. You sideline him and then destroy him.
[07:14.760 --> 07:23.760]  As I've been saying for five months, Trump is now doing it. That is very positive news. He deserves to be in prison, not directing the collapse of this country.
[07:23.760 --> 07:37.760]  That's coming up next segment and the incredible fear mongering around it. New flu strain, new COVID strain, new swine strain. Something's killing elephants. It may kill us. Run for the hills.
[07:37.760 --> 07:54.760]  But only the United States, only the United States has to stay shut down. And notice now the blue states can open back up. It's only Texas and Florida and Arizona and a few other areas like that. It's all political. That is coming up.
[07:54.760 --> 08:07.760]  We also have the key to victory in cancel culture, doubling down against it and not backing down boycott Goya food sales surge as Trump supporters clean out store shelves.
[08:07.760 --> 08:16.760]  Remember when Chick-fil-A wouldn't back down to the LGBTP crew saying you shouldn't be closed on Sunday. Christianity hurts our feelings.
[08:16.760 --> 08:25.760]  Their sales roughly double the next year. Now the sun's taken over and it's thrown out all of the wind and their sales are slumping. But that's just the way this operates.
[08:25.760 --> 08:39.760]  I wonder if Goya food now that their food's being sold off the shelves will back down and worship the SJW is that's all coming up in a huge raft of Black Lives Matter leftist organizations.
[08:39.760 --> 08:56.760]  It's just a big umbrella for communists and Soros and UN organizations. And now that's becoming crystal clear to everybody and they've been caught Black Lives Matter connected individuals staging more false flags against themselves.
[08:56.760 --> 09:03.760]  So we're going to be going through all of that latest with Maxine Waters and more today.
[09:03.760 --> 09:10.760]  Also, speaking of false flags, more people are being caught claiming they had COVID for an attention.
[09:10.760 --> 09:23.760]  And then turning out they didn't have COVID like the NBC News contributor, Dr. Joseph Fair, who would pop in on all these shows that how he had COVID, but he did not have COVID.
[09:23.760 --> 09:30.760]  The age of the false flag is upon us, but the people of the world are waking up in a big, big way.
[09:30.760 --> 09:36.760]  Again, I don't very often air a report two days in a row, but on the Sunday show I aired this. It's so important.
[09:36.760 --> 09:48.760]  I want to air it again. I want to encourage listeners. This is not a spectator sport. This is Mortal Kombat against the globalist to share the very important report.
[09:48.760 --> 10:00.760]  The truth behind the mask that is at band.video in the Greg Reese section. You go to band.video, just the word band, then the dot, then video.
[10:00.760 --> 10:07.760]  And you go to the left-hand corner where there's three lines. Click that. It will load up all the channels and hosts and reporters and special events.
[10:07.760 --> 10:14.760]  And you'll see Greg Reese. It's right there for you. It's got 180,000 views. That's great since Saturday since yesterday.
[10:14.760 --> 10:23.760]  But that's not enough. It needs five million views like our top video has. That's how we defeat the globalist. That's how we move the ball down the field.
[10:23.760 --> 10:33.760]  And remember, you only get information like this at band.video. It's banned on YouTube. It's banned on Facebook. It's banned on Twitter.
[10:33.760 --> 10:43.760]  They don't want you to see information like this because it's powerful. And all these virologists and all these epidemiologists and all these top scientists and doctors
[10:43.760 --> 10:50.760]  and nurses that have witnessed the fraud of COVID-19, all the different scams involved with it.
[10:50.760 --> 10:58.760]  They're all being banned on Google and Facebook and Twitter and YouTube as well. But their videos live on at band.video. I routinely go.
[10:58.760 --> 11:12.760]  This will be banned and it is banned. It's got two or three million views, medical doctor laying out facts. It's gone because they have to shut up because the U.N. and Fauci are the bosses.
[11:12.760 --> 11:16.760]  They are the masters. They are the kings. They're the only ones that get to speak.
[11:16.760 --> 11:23.760]  But as it comes out that Fauci's invested in all the major vaccines that Gates has involved in, it turns out he was involved in AIDS drugs.
[11:23.760 --> 11:33.760]  It turns out he's been there 78 years old since the 70s. This bureaucrat that thinks he's president is in a lot of trouble.
[11:33.760 --> 11:42.760]  But we're in a lot of trouble as the economic numbers I have show that we are barreling towards a major, major depression if things don't reverse.
[11:42.760 --> 11:48.760]  All right, we're going to go to this special report then to break and then back with the Globalist Army, Black Lives Matter.
[11:48.760 --> 11:56.760]  And what an intelligent name for it. It's not really black people. It's mainly white folks. But then if you say no to them, you're racist. Here is the report.
[11:56.760 --> 12:04.760]  First, we were told that wearing masks would do more harm than good, which is what the science still supports.
[12:04.760 --> 12:15.760]  But now, even as the COVID-19 pandemic is turning out to be less harmful than the seasonal flu, we are being told to wear the mask.
[12:15.760 --> 12:26.760]  Boston, Texas has threatened a $2,000 fine for those not wearing the mask and have even suggested that we wear the mask while at home.
[12:26.760 --> 12:31.760]  We still need people to wear the mask in public. We still need people to keep social distance and isolation.
[12:31.760 --> 12:37.760]  Ryan, the one thing I want to try to get across today is we need to do that when we're in our homes also.
[12:37.760 --> 12:47.760]  Science tells us that these masks are doing nothing but hurting our natural immune system. So why is it so important that we wear the mask?
[12:47.760 --> 12:56.760]  If one were to look at what is happening as if it were a massive initiation ritual, then things may begin to make more sense.
[12:56.760 --> 13:01.760]  The initiation ritual can be found throughout all of human history.
[13:01.760 --> 13:11.760]  We find it in ancient tribes and religions, all the way up to modern gangs, fraternities, and in the military.
[13:11.760 --> 13:23.760]  Psychological studies have taught us how initiation rituals work, primarily how they increase a person's desire to conform to the group they are being initiated into.
[13:23.760 --> 13:30.760]  The ritual is almost always the same. First, the initiate is isolated.
[13:30.760 --> 13:37.760]  Their familiar everyday routines are disrupted, and their normal rules of living are altered.
[13:37.760 --> 13:47.760]  The initiates are made to look the same. Their heads may be shaved, they may be given matching outfits, or they may be instructed to wear a mask.
[13:47.760 --> 14:00.760]  These techniques symbolically strip the initiate of their unique identity, so they can cease seeing themselves as an individual and begin seeing themselves as part of the group.
[14:00.760 --> 14:07.760]  The wearer of the mask loses his previous identity and assumes a new one.
[14:07.760 --> 14:15.760]  The initiate is then subjected to just enough trauma to put them in a mild state of cognitive dissonance.
[14:15.760 --> 14:21.760]  This dissonance puts the initiate into a state of confusion and anxiety.
[14:21.760 --> 14:27.760]  They are now ready to be transformed into a member of the initiating group.
[14:27.760 --> 14:34.760]  In their isolation, thoughts they have ignored or buried for years suddenly become unavoidable.
[14:34.760 --> 14:41.760]  Emotions are triggered, and a new window of thought is opened within the initiate's mind.
[14:41.760 --> 14:46.760]  And in this state, the new normal is introduced.
[14:46.760 --> 14:53.760]  This worldwide initiation ritual is creating a massive separation in humanity.
[14:53.760 --> 15:00.760]  The obedient and the defiant are being drawn apart like a chemistry purification experiment.
[15:00.760 --> 15:06.760]  And it would seem that the obedient ones are being initiated into something.
[15:06.760 --> 15:13.760]  The new normal, the new age, the new world order.
[15:13.760 --> 15:17.760]  A world where science no longer matters.
[15:17.760 --> 15:22.760]  A world where blind obedience is all that is respected.
[15:22.760 --> 15:34.760]  And if this is a worldwide initiation ritual, then we can certainly expect the obedient initiated to be turned against the rest of us.
[15:34.760 --> 15:38.760]  For Infowars.com, this is Greg Rees.
[16:05.760 --> 16:08.760]  It's a pleasure to be talking right now here, man.
[16:08.760 --> 16:10.760]  Sir, it's an honor to talk to you, brother.
[16:10.760 --> 16:13.760]  I'm from New Brink, Connecticut, and I just want to plug in.
[16:13.760 --> 16:17.760]  I'm a truck driver, and two before us have changed the way I drive.
[16:17.760 --> 16:21.760]  Me and my brothers that drive, there's a couple of us.
[16:21.760 --> 16:24.760]  We're all Hispanics, Cubans, Puerto Ricans.
[16:24.760 --> 16:31.760]  We used to be on Monster and Red Bull and Rolla, and I have lost weight because I started drinking all that sugar.
[16:31.760 --> 16:33.760]  And I just want to thank you for that, man.
[16:33.760 --> 16:38.760]  Well, brother, we put more in this than any other long-term high-quality energy powder there is.
[16:38.760 --> 16:41.760]  So this was designed on one of the top guys in the country.
[16:41.760 --> 16:46.760]  He didn't want his name on it because obviously the political issues, but we had to pay a lot of money for this formulation just for the design of it.
[16:46.760 --> 16:50.760]  And we believe it is the best, strongest, but healthiest energy out there.
[16:50.760 --> 16:53.760]  And you're saying that it's made your life better, so that means a lot to me. Thank you.
[16:53.760 --> 16:55.760]  To all your truck drivers, we love you.
[16:55.760 --> 16:57.760]  It's finally here.

[17:57.760 --> 18:07.760]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[18:07.760 --> 18:27.760]  Music
[18:27.760 --> 18:36.760]  I don't need to tell you the listeners of this broadcast that there is a multinational corporate consortium openly trying to break down our
[18:36.760 --> 18:42.760]  society and tear us apart.
[18:42.760 --> 18:47.760]  They've been caught admitting it. They brag about it. Hell, it's out in the open now. It's not just in the WikiLeaks.
[18:47.760 --> 18:54.760]  But just look at some of these headlines before I go to some of these shocking videos.
[18:54.760 --> 19:07.760]  Police, student BLM activist at Texas A&M left racist notes on his own car in viral hate crimes hoax.
[19:07.760 --> 19:15.760]  Because this individual believes the only way they can have an identity, like Jesse Smollett, is to be a victim.
[19:15.760 --> 19:27.760]  Can you imagine if you don't believe you have any choices in the world or you believe that you're so deficient that you've got to go out and be a victim so you can be given special allotment?
[19:27.760 --> 19:44.760]  And because no one's doing it, instead everybody's actually rolling the red carpet out for you, you see Jesse Smollett and Bubba Wallace and nobody, you know, that pulls these getting in trouble, you go ahead and do it yourself.
[19:44.760 --> 19:56.760]  There will be more than 10 articles a day where Democrat politicians, you name it, get caught doing this.
[19:56.760 --> 20:03.760]  And now it's down to the grassroots and when I go out on the streets, I don't care if they're black or they're white.
[20:03.760 --> 20:07.760]  I haven't had yet any Hispanics do a false flag.
[20:07.760 --> 20:19.760]  They will come over an old man in a wheelchair and pinch me harder than hell where I got a little purple mark on my stomach hoping I turn around and punch him in the face so they can videotape it and then edit it.
[20:19.760 --> 20:23.760]  And there are two liberals videotaping while it happens or leftist.
[20:23.760 --> 20:28.760]  I mean, that's the culture of criminal evil.
[20:28.760 --> 20:37.760]  We're imagine you go around trying to frame people so you can be the good guy and they can be the bad guy.
[20:37.760 --> 20:40.760]  That's all the studies show hundreds and hundreds of studies.
[20:40.760 --> 20:41.760]  They're all the same.
[20:41.760 --> 20:42.760]  The left is mentally ill.
[20:42.760 --> 20:44.760]  The left steals more, way more.
[20:44.760 --> 20:47.760]  The left doesn't give to charity but tells you they do.
[20:47.760 --> 20:50.760]  They're just trash.
[20:50.760 --> 20:53.760]  They know America cares about not being racist.
[20:53.760 --> 20:55.760]  They know America cares about being good to the poor.
[20:55.760 --> 20:57.760]  They know America wants to stand up against evil.
[20:57.760 --> 21:01.760]  We're not perfect, but on average, we've been one of the best countries.
[21:01.760 --> 21:08.760]  And so these soulless people punch our buttons and jerk our chains.
[21:08.760 --> 21:10.760]  A great example is up on infowars.com.
[21:10.760 --> 21:15.760]  We'll cover it next segment.
[21:15.760 --> 21:26.760]  The Democrats came out and said that much of their operatives said that Trump's campaign shirt of an American eagle carrying an American flag in its feet.
[21:26.760 --> 21:31.760]  Trump is Nazi and then showed the Nazi eagle.
[21:31.760 --> 21:41.760]  Of course, you know, the Nazis copied our eagle, our Art Deco eagle that was an American style on federal buildings before Hitler ever went to power.
[21:41.760 --> 21:44.760]  And of course, there's a big article showing all of that on info wars.
[21:44.760 --> 21:46.760]  It's ridiculous.
[21:46.760 --> 21:48.760]  It's an eagle.
[21:48.760 --> 21:50.760]  It's got an American flag.
[21:50.760 --> 21:52.760]  It's sitting on.
[21:52.760 --> 21:54.760]  You know, the Mexican eagle's got a snake.
[21:54.760 --> 21:55.760]  It's captured.
[21:55.760 --> 21:57.760]  Is it Nazi?
[21:57.760 --> 21:59.760]  This is what the left does.
[21:59.760 --> 22:07.760]  They take every symbol and they appropriate it, they expropriate it, and then they tell you you're bad.
[22:07.760 --> 22:15.760]  And the left is now defending this, even though it turns out Nancy Pelosi has her campaign symbol is an eagle with a symbol under it.
[22:15.760 --> 22:17.760]  It has nothing to do with that.
[22:17.760 --> 22:21.760]  The Israeli symbol on their fighter jets is an eagle.
[22:21.760 --> 22:23.760]  Are they Nazis too?
[22:23.760 --> 22:25.760]  Saddam Hussein's symbol was an eagle.
[22:25.760 --> 22:30.760]  The eagle is the most common symbol for a nation.
[22:30.760 --> 22:32.760]  Next is the star.
[22:32.760 --> 22:34.760]  Next is a tree.
[22:34.760 --> 22:36.760]  I looked it up this morning.
[22:36.760 --> 22:38.760]  And next is the sign.
[22:38.760 --> 22:42.760]  The eagle is used in Asia.
[22:42.760 --> 22:49.760]  It's used in Russia, double headed, meaning both sides of the empire, both the Pacific and the Atlantic, the Germans.
[22:49.760 --> 22:52.760]  You know, Hitler didn't come up with it either.
[22:52.760 --> 23:01.760]  The Germans have been using the eagle since Roman legions left 1600 years ago and the Germans adopted it.
[23:01.760 --> 23:03.760]  In fact, there's a 1600 year old eagle right there.
[23:03.760 --> 23:06.760]  Oh, look at Pelosi with her Nazi eagle.
[23:06.760 --> 23:07.760]  Sorry, I'm digressing.
[23:07.760 --> 23:08.760]  I said next segment.
[23:08.760 --> 23:14.760]  But see, they're assailing all knowledge because all knowledge can only be approved by them.
[23:14.760 --> 23:16.760]  In fact, look here.
[23:16.760 --> 23:18.760]  I have a piece of art, one of my favorite pieces of art.
[23:18.760 --> 23:22.760]  It's a sculpture of angel wings.
[23:22.760 --> 23:25.760]  I like it because it looks like a Roman standard, but it's not gold.
[23:25.760 --> 23:26.760]  It's different.
[23:26.760 --> 23:30.760]  I've looked for another piece of art like it can't find it.
[23:30.760 --> 23:33.760]  It's a symbol of the transcendence.
[23:33.760 --> 23:34.760]  The spirit doesn't die.
[23:34.760 --> 23:37.760]  The body can die.
[23:37.760 --> 23:44.760]  So you can fear death all day, but if your spirits with God, you will transcend.
[23:44.760 --> 23:46.760]  Is that Nazi now?
[23:46.760 --> 23:49.760]  That's just how they change the subject because they can't win the argument.
[23:49.760 --> 23:51.760]  They're jamming.
[23:51.760 --> 23:54.760]  If you have a radio communication going out, people are listening to in a war.
[23:54.760 --> 23:56.760]  They can't counter it with propaganda.
[23:56.760 --> 23:59.760]  They counter it with jamming the signal.
[23:59.760 --> 24:01.760]  You're like, hey, I'd like to live in a free country.
[24:01.760 --> 24:02.760]  Shut up, Nazi.
[24:02.760 --> 24:03.760]  Hey, I like the American flag.
[24:03.760 --> 24:06.760]  Shut up, Nazi.
[24:06.760 --> 24:08.760]  You know, Satanists use upside down stars.
[24:08.760 --> 24:13.760]  Does that mean we're Satanist because the flag has 50 upright stars, pinnacles?
[24:13.760 --> 24:18.760]  Again, that's all they do at colleges and high school everywhere is now attack.
[24:18.760 --> 24:20.760]  Oh, two plus two might not equal four.
[24:20.760 --> 24:23.760]  That's racist.
[24:23.760 --> 24:24.760]  You know, that doesn't make sense.
[24:24.760 --> 24:30.760]  YouTube, you know, put strikes on channels that have live chests that say white knight takes black pawn.
[24:30.760 --> 24:31.760]  That actually got them a strike.
[24:31.760 --> 24:33.760]  Well, you can't take a black pawn.
[24:33.760 --> 24:35.760]  You can't say a black is a pawn.
[24:35.760 --> 24:39.760]  What mental illness is that?
[24:39.760 --> 24:46.760]  Yes, there's an ancient Roman coin with the eagle.
[24:46.760 --> 24:48.760]  Pretty powerful symbol for your country.
[24:48.760 --> 25:01.760]  Oh, but because Hitler used it, nobody can ever use an eagle again, not Mexico, not the United States, not Iraq, not the Russians, not anybody.
[25:01.760 --> 25:04.760]  In fact, I saw a bunch of comments even on Info Wars.
[25:04.760 --> 25:09.760]  The day I wore this shirt, I've had like 20 years that has an American eagle on it with 20 stars around it.
[25:09.760 --> 25:10.760]  I just like the T shirt.
[25:10.760 --> 25:11.760]  I got it.
[25:11.760 --> 25:12.760]  I like America.
[25:12.760 --> 25:13.760]  I like Eagles.
[25:13.760 --> 25:14.760]  I'm proud of my country.
[25:14.760 --> 25:20.760]  They're like, that's Jones being Masonic with an eagle code because the Mason's use it again.
[25:20.760 --> 25:22.760]  They're making everyone superstitious about information.
[25:22.760 --> 25:23.760]  Sorry.
[25:23.760 --> 25:24.760]  I only got into one article.
[25:24.760 --> 25:27.760]  I've literally got more over that Nazi flag.
[25:27.760 --> 25:33.760]  I've literally got, ladies and gentlemen, 20 different articles, at least on BLM.
[25:33.760 --> 25:37.760]  And Soros funding at all, and just the total insanity.
[25:37.760 --> 25:41.760]  We're going to cover it when we come back and play these clips, but my head's spinning.
[25:41.760 --> 25:43.760]  By the way, I keep saying this is the last day.
[25:43.760 --> 25:44.760]  That's not a sales tactic.
[25:44.760 --> 25:46.760]  It's because I don't have a new sale.
[25:46.760 --> 25:50.760]  We have a new product that's in for like a week and I haven't had time to go cut the ad for it.
[25:50.760 --> 25:57.760]  So even though we're about to sell out of all these products and they told me no, they won't be back in for months, sell them at full price to fund us, get rid of the sale.
[25:57.760 --> 26:00.760]  I haven't because there's not, there's not a new sale.
[26:00.760 --> 26:05.760]  So today is the last day by tomorrow morning.
[26:05.760 --> 26:07.760]  This afternoon I'm cutting the ads.
[26:07.760 --> 26:10.760]  There will be a new product up for sale, but the big, huge mega sell will be over.
[26:10.760 --> 26:12.760]  So I would say you want store on free shipping.
[26:12.760 --> 26:13.760]  You want double Patriot points.
[26:13.760 --> 26:15.760]  You want to get bodies, ultimate turmeric formula.
[26:15.760 --> 26:19.760]  You want to get winter sun with the vitamin D3 and the vitamin K taken out of the tongue.
[26:19.760 --> 26:21.760]  That's so good for your immune system, your body period.
[26:21.760 --> 26:24.760]  You want to get the DNA force plus 50% off.
[26:24.760 --> 26:26.760]  Again, double Patriot points for free shipping.
[26:26.760 --> 26:28.760]  You want to get vitamin mineral fusion 50% off.
[26:28.760 --> 26:30.760]  You want to get lung close 50% off survival.
[26:30.760 --> 26:36.760]  So next three, all of it, 30% off the azobites, take advantage of it now, store on free shipping, double Patriot points.
[26:36.760 --> 26:39.760]  And it will be ending sometime tonight or tomorrow morning.
[26:39.760 --> 26:46.760]  Because I absolutely, absolutely have to end the special because a lot of these things are close to selling out and they won't come in for months.
[26:46.760 --> 26:52.760]  And again, my business guy explains, you want to sell it close to full price Alex and fund the operation to stop the sale.
[26:52.760 --> 26:53.760]  So it will end.
[26:53.760 --> 26:56.760]  I know what we'll do to make them conform to our cult.
[26:56.760 --> 26:58.760]  We'll all tell them to wear masks or they're going to die.
[26:58.760 --> 27:03.760]  And then we'll release the pressure for a while and then bring it back and squeeze it harder and release it again.
[27:03.760 --> 27:04.760]  And we'll be the Virtue second ones.
[27:04.760 --> 27:10.760]  We'll be the Angels even though our Lord and Master Bill Gates helped fund the whole COVID-19.
[27:10.760 --> 27:14.760]  Oh, no, don't seduce me.
[27:14.760 --> 27:15.760]  That's right.
[27:15.760 --> 27:18.760]  That's the code word for Bill Gates's operation.
[27:18.760 --> 27:25.760]  He case that with his good little buddy Dr. Fauci in the surgeon cult.
[27:25.760 --> 27:30.760]  As you know, for girls, there's five different types of villains they secretly desire in the romance novels.
[27:30.760 --> 27:36.760]  One of them is the vampire, the werewolf, the billionaire, and who else?
[27:36.760 --> 27:37.760]  Oh, that's right.
[27:37.760 --> 27:39.760]  There's the surgeon and then there's one other one.
[27:39.760 --> 27:43.760]  And it's so much fun to be ruled over by these psychotic psychopaths.
[27:43.760 --> 27:49.760]  It's so good to know that there are masters and they're coming to rape us with their inoculations.
[27:49.760 --> 27:51.760]  Psychopaths are so hot.
[27:51.760 --> 28:02.760]  Oh, yeah.
[28:02.760 --> 28:05.760]  Where the hell did this water come from?
[28:05.760 --> 28:11.760]  Where did it come from?

[29:30.760 --> 29:39.760]  Thanks to you and your word of mouth that is king, that is queen, that is the master of our own destinies.
[29:39.760 --> 29:50.760]  Ladies and gentlemen, there is a war on reality, a war on civilization, a war on our health, a war on our economy, but being aware of it and standing up to it and speaking out against it will defeat it.
[29:50.760 --> 29:56.760]  So take action or be slaves.
[29:56.760 --> 30:04.760]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[30:04.760 --> 30:19.760]  Music
[30:19.760 --> 30:23.760]  Coming to you from the front lines of the fight to restore the republic.
[30:23.760 --> 30:30.760]  Right now we're in a deep tug of war with the globalist over restoring our country from the brink of destruction.
[30:30.760 --> 30:37.760]  Thank you so much for joining us on this live Monday, July 13 2020 transmission.
[30:37.760 --> 30:39.760]  I am your host Alan Jones.
[30:39.760 --> 30:50.760]  I'm going to open the phones up in the entire second and third hour than Gerald Salantes in the fourth hour ahead of the war room and three hours of a great transmission with the one the only Owen shroyer.
[30:50.760 --> 30:52.760]  Okay, so let's plunge right into it.
[30:52.760 --> 30:54.760]  Let's just run through these headlines.
[30:54.760 --> 31:02.760]  Police student BLM activists at Texas A&M left racist notes on his own car in viral hate crimes hoax.
[31:02.760 --> 31:12.760]  And there are so many of these now have you noticed how 99% of them are staged I mean when are there really people doing this.
[31:12.760 --> 31:21.760]  I mean Americans know that's not the way this country is going to go we know the powerful corporations trying to divide us who really goes around and does this.
[31:21.760 --> 31:31.760]  Student Isaiah Martin, who openly advocates for black lives matter on a Twitter account posted pictures, the social platform in June showing three notes on his car windshield.
[31:31.760 --> 31:38.760]  One reading all lives matter one reading, you don't belong here and a third containing a racial slur.
[31:38.760 --> 31:48.760]  Probably put up to it by Antifa operatives is the same group I'll show you documents in a moment, because they want to make the idea of all lives matter Martin Luther King common sense.
[31:48.760 --> 31:54.760]  Tying that to Nazis. This is ADL run I'm sure.
[31:54.760 --> 31:59.760]  And of course he's now been caught doing it goes into all of that.
[31:59.760 --> 32:07.760]  University training students to confront personal relationship to white supremacy to teach you that you are a white supremacist.
[32:07.760 --> 32:14.760]  To say you're guilty to say you're bad and to say that you have less worth until you go into their political control and start denouncing others.
[32:14.760 --> 32:22.760]  That's a big info wars dot com article students and professor team at the University of Florida teamed up to create a week long training called academics for black.
[32:22.760 --> 32:30.760]  Survival and wellness and you go into announcing that you are inherently bad that whiteness is bad this is happening all over the world, not just in the US.
[32:30.760 --> 32:33.760]  I hope someone kills your effing family.
[32:33.760 --> 32:40.760]  This is coming up BLM radical shouts at Portland police that video is coming up.
[32:40.760 --> 32:45.760]  Washington Redskins officially retire name logo.
[32:45.760 --> 32:51.760]  Here you go saying a teams based on folks and giving him a name like that's a bad thing.
[32:51.760 --> 32:59.760]  It's not bad to call a guy with this out in the sun that's white or redneck or it's not bad I guess Larry the cable guys got to get rid of his whole stick.
[32:59.760 --> 33:02.760]  Or the other guy that says you might be a redneck.
[33:02.760 --> 33:14.760]  Look at this Maxine waters Trump and supporters insuring blacks do not rise to any level of influence or power we're going to play that clip first here in a moment.
[33:14.760 --> 33:18.760]  Going back to what I mentioned USA Today slammed.
[33:18.760 --> 33:24.760]  For repeating idiotic claim that Trump campaign t shirts has Nazi symbol.
[33:24.760 --> 33:37.760]  USA Today's editor actually put an article out decrying the president for putting out a campaign ad with a black man wearing the really good looking cool shirt and I'll let you know a little bit of a secret.
[33:37.760 --> 33:42.760]  Last Friday I said I want the official final shirt of campaign.
[33:42.760 --> 33:44.760]  2020 to be an eagle.
[33:44.760 --> 33:49.760]  Somehow the American flag maybe it's standing on it or maybe it's behind it.
[33:49.760 --> 33:55.760]  But I want stars around it like a blue t shirt I've had for many years I wear on air that's got an eagle on it.
[33:55.760 --> 34:06.760]  And boom I wasn't even aware of this triggering shirts we're going to make one similar but even better I think we're going to have the Betsy Ross flag that the eagle is standing on.
[34:06.760 --> 34:12.760]  And then I think we're going to have the Betsy Ross flag on the right shoulder and then when 2020 on the back with info wars dot com.
[34:12.760 --> 34:18.760]  Particularly triggering but there's that and now this.
[34:18.760 --> 34:22.760]  Of course in the case of black lives matter and.
[34:22.760 --> 34:33.760]  Antifa when they have that iron clenched fist of the communist they say that's why they have that but continue George Soros donates 220 million.
[34:33.760 --> 34:39.760]  To radical BLM groups including move it to end the police as we know it close quote.
[34:39.760 --> 34:49.760]  But remember they've had news articles saying Jones is crazy fact check Soros doesn't fund Antifa or BLM no he just funds.
[34:49.760 --> 34:52.760]  Refuse fascism the group that funds them.
[34:52.760 --> 34:58.760]  Like if I gave $20 to one of the crew members and said please ask my assistant to go get me lunch.
[34:58.760 --> 35:04.760]  Did I pay for the lunch or did the person handed off the 20 pay for the lunch it's all some radical games.
[35:04.760 --> 35:12.760]  Here's another one leftist Islamists and BLM radicals accused St. Louis Catholics of holding white nationals rally.
[35:12.760 --> 35:21.760]  We're going to show you that incredible video coming up as well government funded youth groups foster care providers agitate for George Floyd.
[35:21.760 --> 35:25.760]  All the major unions all the major groups organized weaponized.
[35:25.760 --> 35:33.760]  They'll always have one black person up at the front as the tip of the spear as the mast head as the figurehead.
[35:33.760 --> 35:38.760]  Saying you can't oppose this or your against black people.
[35:38.760 --> 35:51.760]  AOC says skyrocketing crowd in New York City caused by poor people shoplifting bread murders stabbing killings all of it she says is caused.
[35:51.760 --> 35:57.760]  By people shoplifting bread isn't that like some Tolstoy novel.
[35:57.760 --> 36:07.760]  College Democrats satanists and witches team up to shut down young conservatives Texas chapter I'm not getting the groups teamed up to shut it down can't do that University of North Texas.
[36:07.760 --> 36:16.760]  Because they're such good liberals I want to get to the young white mother killed by black lives matter mob for reportedly saying all lives matter when they came by questioning and are you with us.
[36:16.760 --> 36:25.760]  Yes but all lives matter as well well you get shot in the head for that barely getting covered in the news I want to hit Maxine waters but since we talk about violence.
[36:25.760 --> 36:36.760]  Let's show the footage from last week it's got no attention of three white people being stabbed for no reason by a racist crazy black man on a New York subway.
[36:36.760 --> 36:50.760]  Let's play that footage and we'll show New York City mayor now has to backtrack after there's footage of police backing down and then being taunted and choked out by crazy crowds but first let's go to the stabbing.
[36:50.760 --> 37:06.760]  This white privilege.
[37:06.760 --> 37:12.760]  By the way police are not prosecuting any of us now.
[37:12.760 --> 37:23.760]  Now if you go watch if you go watch the Joker I told you would cause all this it's got subliminal messages overt messages the newspaper headlines.
[37:23.760 --> 37:29.760]  Murdering innocent white people on buses on trains it's all a race war programming menu.
[37:29.760 --> 37:42.760]  And the media attack me and said John's insane six months ago but six months later no one's laughing because it's all been pre programmed all beta tested around the country for at least a decade by Obama and George Soros.
[37:42.760 --> 37:58.760]  Here is New York City mayor now calls for unity at revival video shows man putting Bronx cop in chokehold choking him down I have dozens of videos of white cops black cops Hispanic cops being being surrounded by angry racial mobs.
[37:58.760 --> 38:02.760]  Saying you're bad because you're the police here it is.
[38:02.760 --> 38:28.760]  Why you can't afford that.
[38:28.760 --> 38:37.760]  It's not a big deal but but this morning I got up and there's an article in four words about this chokeout article and then it shows another choking event.
[38:37.760 --> 38:45.760]  And then I sent emails I said hey we need our text messages we need to update this with the right one so when we come back we're going to get that for you.
[38:45.760 --> 38:58.760]  Because hey what ends well ends well as they say and then we're going to show that and then I'm going to show you the footage and the newscast about the white woman being shot to death.
[38:58.760 --> 39:03.760]  And the point is there's now 12 to one black on white crime and the media is encouraging it.
[39:03.760 --> 39:15.760]  And so some deranged criminal mentally ill black people not even a large minority but a very active vicious small minority of black folks are going out.
[39:15.760 --> 39:24.760]  Mainly black males about 13 to 25 and targeting white people with knockout games and shooting them in the head and stabbing them and this is all going on.
[39:24.760 --> 39:30.760]  And the media is all busy covering it up.
[39:30.760 --> 39:37.760]  And you've got to ask yourself well why is that well hell in Europe they arrest you if you point out that a brown person hurts a white person.
[39:37.760 --> 39:40.760]  It's part of a larger agenda.
[39:40.760 --> 39:52.760]  The left has a plan will break it all down on the other side info wars dot com tomorrow's news today news wars dot com.
[39:52.760 --> 40:00.760]  The reasons that the globalist launch this planetary lockdown the number one reason is it serves every one of their purposes.
[40:00.760 --> 40:11.760]  We've gone over those purposes many times here on air the casual society the surveillance system global government medical tyranny forced inoculation.
[40:11.760 --> 40:27.760]  But the most important facet is it teaches us that we are obsolete that we are non essential as we begin to witness automation computers and robots take over the jobs that people once had by design.
[40:27.760 --> 40:31.760]  This isn't like it's some advancement that we just fell into.
[40:31.760 --> 40:48.760]  It's been preplanned organized globally and it's extremely predatory and through governmental actuaries and tax programs and regulations the central banks that control it all are able to pick the winners and the losers and consolidate power.
[40:48.760 --> 40:52.760]  This is the truest form of technocracy fascism.
[40:52.760 --> 41:01.760]  A lot of you have been listening for more than 20 years and if you go back to those shows we laid out the takeover plan the tracking of cell phones.
[41:01.760 --> 41:13.760]  How programmed master computers would manipulate control society how they'd be able to not just predict large groups of human movements and activities but even predict what individuals would do.
[41:13.760 --> 41:28.760]  And then once you could predict what individuals were going to be doing you can add stimuli through the AI systems through the computers through digital billboards through face scanning through the social credit score to control people and make them act like you wanted to.
[41:28.760 --> 41:37.760]  But when we cover that the media would attack us and say we were making it up it was a conspiracy theory even though it was in the actual corporate level blueprint documents.
[41:37.760 --> 41:45.760]  Well the next level of the blueprint documents explained to us that they are setting up this control system to make humans obsolete and phase us out.
[41:45.760 --> 41:53.760]  And it's something about a thousand times crazier than what Hitler planned so we might want to dismantle the system now.

[42:53.760 --> 43:09.760]  It's cool that under the mega-opolis technology plan things are going to be so incredibly fair and wonderful because an all-seeing, all-loving computer that doesn't discriminate is going to decide who gets what resources, who gets what jobs.
[43:09.760 --> 43:22.760]  But in reality it's building a post-human world so that you can be made obsolete, domesticated, dumbed down, drugged, distracted, atomized, and then slowly killed.
[43:22.760 --> 43:29.760]  This is the brave new world. It's the post-human world. It's the dreaming of the post-human world.
[43:29.760 --> 43:33.760]  The Wired magazine and the Wall Street Journal all tell us about it.
[43:33.760 --> 43:42.760]  Oh, now they tell us our smart phones don't just track or remove. They're monitoring our psychology and sending it back to a corporate database globally.
[43:42.760 --> 43:53.760]  You see, the bear trap closed on our leg now and the vampire walked out of the bushes and is explaining to us how he's slowly going to bleed us and destroy us.
[44:12.760 --> 44:23.760]  I want to be infinitely clear about something. Thank you for joining us. I'm Alex Jones, your host, and you're tuned in.
[44:23.760 --> 44:33.760]  I don't sit here and say that I care about brown people, black people, pink people, polka-dotted people, speckled people, humans, because I'm something virtually a signaler.
[44:33.760 --> 44:42.760]  I genuinely want to see humanity work together. I genuinely want to see us all use our skills together to go to the stars and beyond.
[44:42.760 --> 44:51.760]  And I hate watching the really satanic, pedophile, satanist at the top play us off against each other, and I'm really tired of it. That's it.
[44:51.760 --> 45:01.760]  I grew up in Dallas, Texas, and I had a lot of black friends as I played sports, and they thought I was crazy when my parents would drop me off in, you know, their neighborhood.
[45:01.760 --> 45:10.760]  Because that area, Rockwell, Texas, had an area that was the older part of town, from the older part of the city, and it was mainly the black part of town, and there were some racist black people there.
[45:10.760 --> 45:18.760]  And I got attacked a few times. My parents are like, well, that's how you make your child tough, kind of old-fashioned.
[45:18.760 --> 45:24.760]  I guarantee you there aren't any black people out there probably walking around that have been, let's not exaggerate.
[45:24.760 --> 45:33.760]  I mean, I probably had, I got in over 100 fights with black people, and almost every time they initiated it.
[45:33.760 --> 45:42.760]  And, you know, I'd beat up some guy my age when I was like 15, and then his brother who was out of prison would catch me at McDonald's, and, you know, it would get into a really bad situation.
[45:42.760 --> 45:46.760]  And that'll teach you how to fight when somebody's trying to kill you.
[45:46.760 --> 45:56.760]  So, I guarantee you there's no black people out there that have ever had 100 white people start fights with you.
[45:56.760 --> 46:01.760]  Maybe you ran into a couple racist white people here or there. I mean, I know how the KKK is.
[46:01.760 --> 46:08.760]  You know, my family's got property out in East Texas, and in the wrong town, you walk into a dairy queen with a good-looking girl on your arm.
[46:08.760 --> 46:17.760]  Two or three pickup trucks will pull up, and these guys will strut in, and they'll go, usually teenagers or college guys, and go, this is our town, are you in the such-and-such?
[46:17.760 --> 46:21.760]  And if you don't know what that means, then, you know, they're like, well, you need to watch yourself.
[46:21.760 --> 46:26.760]  And I'm the type of guy back then, I'll say, how about I take you outside and literally beat the living hell out of all three of you?
[46:26.760 --> 46:37.760]  So, I've been around it, okay? And I had the KKK mess with me twice, twice.
[46:37.760 --> 46:45.760]  And they acted just like the racist black people. It's all tribal gang crap.
[46:45.760 --> 46:53.760]  And I don't know, I mean, you go in the wrong Mexican bar, they're probably not going to throw you out because you're a white guy or a black guy,
[46:53.760 --> 47:03.760]  but if you mess with them, they'll stab you to death. I mean, if you disrespect them, I never really had trouble with Mexicans until one time four of them broke my leg.
[47:03.760 --> 47:11.760]  But that was over a girl. The point is, is that I've lived in the real world.
[47:11.760 --> 47:19.760]  And so I see these leftists raised in these big, high-rise buildings that don't ever even get out, and they're trying to manipulate us, all this race stuff.
[47:19.760 --> 47:27.760]  Everybody that's literally been on the real streets of Dallas, Texas, or Chicago, Illinois, or Detroit, Michigan, or Los Angeles, California, or Washington, D.C.
[47:27.760 --> 47:33.760]  Knows all this race crap is a load of bull.
[47:33.760 --> 47:42.760]  And if you're a black person in the wrong area of a black neighborhood, you're going to get hurt by black males, who everybody in that neighborhood doesn't like, but who are in a gang.
[47:42.760 --> 47:51.760]  And the same thing goes if you're white. So let's all just cut through the crap and get down to what the reality is.
[47:51.760 --> 48:02.760]  Anybody that's lived in the real world, and it needs some globalist high rise, glow in the dark, leftist, you know, suburb, or wherever they're at.
[48:02.760 --> 48:12.760]  This isn't real. We're not buying this. We all, black, white, Hispanic, old, young, we see right through it.
[48:12.760 --> 48:17.760]  Because we know it's a load of crap. People have their issues. People have their problems.
[48:17.760 --> 48:30.760]  It is a fluid white people who are projecting their, not even racism, their fear of the unknown.
[48:30.760 --> 48:40.760]  I know a lot of leftists. They don't really leave their houses, most of them, most of them are very unhealthy, and they live in fantasy land.
[48:40.760 --> 48:50.760]  Now, that's a stereotype, but that's the biggest portion, and the studies show it. So that's why their propaganda isn't as successful as they think.
[48:50.760 --> 48:56.760]  Because it isn't based in the real world.
[48:56.760 --> 49:06.760]  Now, there is a certain thug class of gangster, and you've seen the footage out of churches in New York, St. Louis, you name it,
[49:06.760 --> 49:13.760]  where you'll see a bunch of convict-looking white people and convict-looking black people all strutting around just like convicts.
[49:13.760 --> 49:19.760]  You know, you pull up a gas pump, man, you can tell a real hardened, violent convict just by how they act.
[49:19.760 --> 49:25.760]  Look at that guy in purple, that white guy. I mean, he is thugging out, man.
[49:25.760 --> 49:31.760]  So are the black people. They're scum. They go in a church screaming yell at a multiracial church, calling white supremacists,
[49:31.760 --> 49:37.760]  shoved people trying to start a fight. That's because there wasn't a dad at home to beat their ass when they acted like that.
[49:37.760 --> 49:45.760]  Those people are a joke. But you're then going to have cases like this one, where black people are coming up.
[49:45.760 --> 49:51.760]  This is happening in Austin. You've seen the footage of white people doing it, too, in Utah and in Colorado and in California.
[49:51.760 --> 49:55.760]  People come up to your car and say, black lives matter.
[49:55.760 --> 50:04.760]  And if you don't smile and say, yes, they pull you out, attack you or shoot you.
[50:04.760 --> 50:12.760]  And now they're going to Catholic churches and coming into them and saying, you're white supremacist until they see the person given the rosary is a black woman.
[50:12.760 --> 50:19.760]  That's how crazy all of this has gotten.
[50:19.760 --> 50:26.760]  And Soros is sitting back laughing. Imagine being 24 year old Jessica Dottie Whitaker.
[50:26.760 --> 50:30.760]  Reportedly a group of black young males come up to her.
[50:30.760 --> 50:34.760]  She's a mother. She is was she dead. Dottie Whitaker.
[50:34.760 --> 50:40.760]  And then when she says all lives matter, they go back, get a gun and shoot her in the head.
[50:40.760 --> 50:45.760]  And she's dead now. You're not going to hear about her on the national news, but this is the true racial attack.
[50:45.760 --> 50:53.760]  And this is what racial Maddow and Van Jones and all of them have created this atmosphere and done this.
[50:53.760 --> 51:00.760]  Well, there's a litmus test, just like with the Christians back in Rome, deny Jesus Christ or we're going to kill you, throw you into the lions.
[51:00.760 --> 51:03.760]  He said, I do not deny Jesus Christ. They kill you.
[51:03.760 --> 51:11.760]  Well, now say only black lives matter run by a group controlled by George Soros that actually runs the abortuaries targeting black people.
[51:11.760 --> 51:20.760]  It's so sick. Let George Soros steal black people's identity for their own good.
[51:20.760 --> 51:25.760]  Or we're going to kill you.
[51:25.760 --> 51:32.760]  And she paid for saying what Martin Luther King would say she's dead. Here's the local newscast.
[51:32.760 --> 51:38.760]  According to the victim's family, the shooting here on the canal started with an argument over race.
[51:38.760 --> 51:49.760]  Eventually the two sides separated and walked away from each other until witnesses claim the killer opened fire from a nearby bridge and then ran away.
[51:49.760 --> 51:58.760]  An argument over black lives matter and language led to a confrontation and eventually gunfire early Sunday morning.
[51:58.760 --> 52:07.760]  It was squashed. They went up the hill, left and thought they left, but they were just sitting on St. Clair Street and waiting for us to come under the bridge.
[52:07.760 --> 52:09.760]  And that's when she's got shot.
[52:09.760 --> 52:18.760]  Jose admits he returned fire but didn't hit anyone and says his fiance, Jessica Doty Whitaker, leaves behind a little boy.
[52:18.760 --> 52:23.760]  I think she shouldn't have left her life. She's got a three year old son. She loves dearly.
[52:23.760 --> 52:29.760]  Explaining to Jessica's son that he'll never see his mom again has been the hardest part for the family.
[52:29.760 --> 52:34.760]  It's hard to tell him his mom's in heaven. When you want to talk to mom, you got to look up and say, I love you, mom.
[52:34.760 --> 52:40.760]  Just one week earlier, two people were shot on the same part of the canal during one of those shootings.
[52:40.760 --> 52:46.760]  A 14-year-old identified as Curtis White Jr. died during an attempted armed robbery.
[52:46.760 --> 52:50.760]  Our message is that the canal is still a safe place to go.
[52:50.760 --> 52:59.760]  The IMPD partners with State Police Department and the Department of Metropolitan Development to patrol different areas along the canal.
[52:59.760 --> 53:01.760]  Police have added...
[53:01.760 --> 53:02.760]  That's enough of it.
[53:02.760 --> 53:06.760]  And of course, they haven't caught who did it and the police are overwhelmed and it's not their fault.
[53:06.760 --> 53:09.760]  Even if you're armed, you're not safe. You just saw that.
[53:09.760 --> 53:11.760]  Let me tell you, East Austin's not safe.
[53:11.760 --> 53:14.760]  Downtown Austin's not safe. There's murders all the time.
[53:14.760 --> 53:17.760]  Robbing, stabbing, shootings, most of it's racial.
[53:17.760 --> 53:19.760]  Nothing is going to be done about it.
[53:19.760 --> 53:22.760]  These areas are not safe.
[53:22.760 --> 53:24.760]  Don't let anybody lie to you.
[53:24.760 --> 53:28.760]  Any leftist city is not safe.
[53:28.760 --> 53:29.760]  Period.
[53:29.760 --> 53:34.760]  Because control has been lost.
[53:34.760 --> 53:37.760]  And that's what I tell my son, who's almost 18.
[53:37.760 --> 53:40.760]  I said, son, where he got, you know, attacked.
[53:40.760 --> 53:43.760]  He was in a gas station getting some food at 11 at night.
[53:43.760 --> 53:49.760]  And a crazy black guy came there and started attacking everybody and Rex helped knock him down and stop him.
[53:49.760 --> 53:51.760]  And the police did nothing when they got there.
[53:51.760 --> 53:53.760]  They said, he literally said, they said, I'm BLM.
[53:53.760 --> 53:55.760]  And the police said, you're allowed to attack people.
[53:55.760 --> 53:59.760]  Grab people, slam their heads and things, start robbing the place.
[53:59.760 --> 54:01.760]  The Austin police said, whoa, your black lives matter.
[54:01.760 --> 54:02.760]  Yes, sir.
[54:02.760 --> 54:04.760]  This is not a joke, ladies and gentlemen.
[54:04.760 --> 54:11.760]  And so you need to understand that when you tell, if you told a group of white people, you're allowed to do whatever you want.
[54:11.760 --> 54:13.760]  There'd be crazy white people out doing this.
[54:13.760 --> 54:16.760]  Well, they've told black people, kill and murder to whatever you want.
[54:16.760 --> 54:18.760]  Most black people are like, well, I'm not going to do that.
[54:18.760 --> 54:21.760]  But there are a bunch of crazy black people out there that will do it.
[54:21.760 --> 54:24.760]  So just be warned, everybody.
[54:24.760 --> 54:27.760]  All right, this is the final day. It is the final day.
[54:27.760 --> 54:30.760]  A store-wide free shipping, double-paid three points.
[54:30.760 --> 54:33.760]  Get your X3, get your body's ultimate formula.
[54:33.760 --> 54:35.760]  I got it in the day. I've extended it out.
[54:35.760 --> 54:38.760]  Got some new specials tomorrow at infowarstore.com.
[54:38.760 --> 55:06.760]  Stay with us right back.
[55:08.760 --> 55:16.760]  It's like band.video, newswars.com, infowars.com, Paul Watson Sites Summit.News,
[55:16.760 --> 55:24.760]  and a lot of other great sites that are getting massive traffic thanks to you and your word of mouth that is king, that is queen,
[55:24.760 --> 55:28.760]  that is the master of our own destinies.
[55:28.760 --> 55:33.760]  Ladies and gentlemen, there is a war on reality, a war on civilization, a war on our health,
[55:33.760 --> 55:39.760]  a war on our economy, but being aware of it and standing up to it and speaking out against it will defeat it.
[55:39.760 --> 55:43.760]  So take action or be slaves.
[55:43.760 --> 55:47.760]  So I was taking care of an errand this morning, and I wasn't even close to downtown,
[55:47.760 --> 55:50.760]  but I was parked on the whole side street going to this business.
[55:50.760 --> 55:56.760]  When I came back out, I saw what looked like two Asian folks, probably Chinese,
[55:56.760 --> 55:59.760]  walking down the sidewalk about 50 yards up ahead of me.
[55:59.760 --> 56:04.760]  And here I am parked a truck with the windows up, and the woman stops and points at me,
[56:04.760 --> 56:08.760]  so they stop and they wait while I'm inside my truck, truck started,
[56:08.760 --> 56:15.760]  and they sit there and stretch, just keeps pointing, and they put their hands out like they're waiting for me to go
[56:15.760 --> 56:19.760]  because I'm not wearing a mask inside my car.
[56:19.760 --> 56:23.760]  And so then I just sat there, so they acted angry and walked past me.
[56:23.760 --> 56:28.760]  I almost shot a video of it on my phone, but everybody sees this stuff happening everywhere.
[56:28.760 --> 56:32.760]  This is mental illness. People are pulling guns on folks that aren't wearing masks.
[56:32.760 --> 56:35.760]  This is all cult programming. This is all about submitting.
[56:35.760 --> 56:40.760]  We cannot submit to this UN brainwashing. It's all a giant fraud.
[56:40.760 --> 56:43.760]  We must expose the fraud or become slaves to it.
[56:43.760 --> 56:48.760]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[56:53.760 --> 57:00.760]  Yeah, here's our new single record from Highwayman 2 album, Silver Stallion.
[57:00.760 --> 57:15.760]  Alright, I'm going to give the number out next segment and cover all this other news and clips I've got here on this live Monday
[57:15.760 --> 57:19.760]  Transmission. I want to thank you all here for joining us in defiance of globalist oppression
[57:19.760 --> 57:24.760]  and attempts to shut us down. It really is a miracle thanks to your support and God's providence.
[57:24.760 --> 57:33.760]  But I wanted to go to this report here with Mr. Smirkonnish of CNN asking,
[57:33.760 --> 57:42.760]  has cancel culture gone too far? Now think about what a ridiculous statement that is.
[57:42.760 --> 57:49.760]  CNN helped pioneer cancel culture and got me banned and countless others banned as little police dogs would go out and report people.
[57:49.760 --> 57:54.760]  And they're the ones that have pushed Congress to censor and do all of this.
[57:54.760 --> 57:57.760]  And now that leftists are being censored, oh, now it's too far.
[57:57.760 --> 58:03.760]  What they're saying is we don't get canceled. You get canceled. Here is that report. We'll be right back.
[58:03.760 --> 58:10.760]  What happens when more than 100 intellectuals make a bid to defend free speech in the face of cancel culture?
[58:10.760 --> 58:16.760]  They get canceled, of course, proving the existence of exactly the sentiments about which they were complaining.
[58:16.760 --> 58:20.760]  This week, a letter was published online by Harper's Magazine under the headline,
[58:20.760 --> 58:26.760]  A Letter on Justice and Open Debate. It bore signatures from people all over the political landscape,
[58:26.760 --> 58:33.760]  like Malcolm Gladwell, David Brooks, Neocon Francis Spukuyama, leftist Noam Chomsky, Margaret Atwood,
[58:33.760 --> 58:40.760]  and CNN's own Fareed Zakaria. After acknowledging this important cultural moment of racial and social justice,
[58:40.760 --> 58:47.760]  it said this, this needed reckoning has also intensified a new set of moral attitudes and political commitments
[58:47.760 --> 58:55.760]  that tend to weaken our norms of open debate and toleration of differences in favor of ideological conformity.
[58:55.760 --> 59:02.760]  Well, the response was swift. The signers were called thin-skinned, privileged, and fearing their loss of relevance.
[59:02.760 --> 59:09.760]  Some signers capitulated. Barnard Professor Jennifer Boylan tweeted an apology for having signed, quote,
[59:09.760 --> 59:16.760]  I did not know who else had signed the letter. I thought I was endorsing a well-meaning if vague message against internet shaming.
[59:16.760 --> 59:23.760]  I did know Chomsky, Steinem, and Atwood were in, and I thought, good company. The consequences are mine to bear.
[59:23.760 --> 59:27.760]  I'm so sorry. But best-selling author, Malcolm Gladwell tweeted,
[59:27.760 --> 59:35.760]  I signed the Harper's Letter because there were lots of people who also signed the Harper's Letter whose views I disagreed with.
[59:35.760 --> 59:38.760]  I thought that was the point of the Harper's Letter.
[59:38.760 --> 59:44.760]  By week's end, the letter had caused what the Daily Beast labeled a media circular firing squad.
[59:44.760 --> 59:51.760]  Then came a joint scathing response from an opposing group of 150-plus intellectuals and media figures,
[59:51.760 --> 59:54.760]  some of whom requested anonymity to protect their jobs.
[59:54.760 --> 59:59.760]  This one was headlined a more specific letter on justice and open debate,
[59:59.760 --> 1:00:03.760]  and it reads in part their letter, meaning the first one,
[1:00:03.760 --> 1:00:11.760]  seeks to uphold a stifling atmosphere and prioritizes signal-blasting their discomfort in the face of valid criticism.
[1:00:11.760 --> 1:00:18.760]  The signatories, many of them white, wealthy, and endowed with massive platforms, argue that they are afraid of being silenced,
[1:00:18.760 --> 1:00:23.760]  that so-called cancel culture is out of control, and that they fear for their jobs and free exchange of ideas,
[1:00:23.760 --> 1:00:28.760]  even as they speak from one of the most prestigious magazines in the country.
[1:00:28.760 --> 1:00:33.760]  If you're having trouble following the highbrow brouhaha, fear not.
[1:00:33.760 --> 1:00:37.760]  I think I can bring home the bombast with a trip to the kitchen cupboard.
[1:00:37.760 --> 1:00:38.760]  Beans.
[1:00:38.760 --> 1:00:40.760]  Goya beans.
[1:00:40.760 --> 1:00:46.760]  The CEO of this kitchen staple was in the Rose Garden on Thursday where he praised the president while announcing
[1:00:46.760 --> 1:00:54.760]  that Goya would donate one million cans of chickpeas and one million other food products to American food banks.
[1:00:54.760 --> 1:01:02.760]  We're all truly blessed at the same time to have a leader like President Trump, who is a builder.
[1:01:02.760 --> 1:01:08.760]  Well, there hasn't been this much stink about beans since the campfire scene in Blazing Saddles.
[1:01:08.760 --> 1:01:16.760]  By Friday morning, the hashtag GoyaWay was trending as prominent Hispanic American leaders called for a boycott of Goya products.
[1:01:16.760 --> 1:01:19.760]  Celebrities like Chrissy Teigen were tweeting things like,
[1:01:19.760 --> 1:01:20.760]  A shame.
[1:01:20.760 --> 1:01:22.760]  Don't care how good the beans taste, though.
[1:01:22.760 --> 1:01:23.760]  Bye-bye.
[1:01:23.760 --> 1:01:28.760]  AOC tweeted, so did Hamilton playwright Lin-Manuel Miranda.
[1:01:28.760 --> 1:01:34.760]  Goya Bean's CEO, Robert Unanaway, told Fox News that he was not apologizing for praising the president,
[1:01:34.760 --> 1:01:37.760]  called the boycott suppression of speech.
[1:01:37.760 --> 1:01:41.760]  You know, once beans were controversial only if we were debating chili recipes.
[1:01:41.760 --> 1:01:47.760]  Now they, too, are part of the partisan divide, like everything else.
[1:01:47.760 --> 1:01:51.760]  All right, folks, we're going to be right back on the other side of the articles on the four-section.
[1:01:51.760 --> 1:01:55.760]  Historical food is again available for shipping within three to four weeks.
[1:01:55.760 --> 1:01:56.760]  We have it.
[1:01:56.760 --> 1:01:59.760]  It's high quality, but it's got to be packaged and shipped out to you.
[1:01:59.760 --> 1:02:03.760]  Some items are shipping in a week, some in four weeks, so they're saying three to four weeks.
[1:02:03.760 --> 1:02:04.760]  It's my patriot.
[1:02:04.760 --> 1:02:07.760]  You have their full catalog, they're in our back end of them full wars.
[1:02:07.760 --> 1:02:08.760]  Store.com.
[1:02:08.760 --> 1:02:13.760]  Get your orders in now before the next big surge comes in.
[1:02:13.760 --> 1:02:18.760]  Believe me, every angle I've looked at tells me that really, really serious times are ahead,
[1:02:18.760 --> 1:02:20.760]  whether Trump wins or loses.
[1:02:20.760 --> 1:02:25.760]  The globalists have already created a world-wide depression, lockdowns on the planetary scale,
[1:02:25.760 --> 1:02:26.760]  and it's only intensifying.
[1:02:26.760 --> 1:02:28.760]  This is one of the big boxes.
[1:02:28.760 --> 1:02:29.760]  You've got to get checked off.
[1:02:29.760 --> 1:02:31.760]  It's high quality, storeable food.
[1:02:31.760 --> 1:02:35.760]  My patriot has really good, high quality food at a very affordable price,
[1:02:35.760 --> 1:02:38.760]  and the packaging is the best you're going to find out there.
[1:02:38.760 --> 1:02:44.760]  Check it out for yourself at infowarstore.com, and then the money that comes in that's extra
[1:02:44.760 --> 1:02:48.760]  helps us fund the information warfare operation that fights the globalist toe-to-toe.
[1:02:48.760 --> 1:03:11.760]  Get your storeable food now at infowarstore.com.
[1:03:11.760 --> 1:03:14.760]  It's hour number two.
[1:03:14.760 --> 1:03:18.760]  It's Monday, July 13th, the year is 2020.
[1:03:18.760 --> 1:03:25.760]  We're 112 days out from the election, and I'm going to open the phones up for first-time
[1:03:25.760 --> 1:03:30.760]  callers in this hour, then free for all in the third hour.
[1:03:30.760 --> 1:03:55.760]  The toll-free number to join us is 877-789-2539.
[1:03:55.760 --> 1:03:56.760]  Think about it.
[1:03:56.760 --> 1:04:01.760]  I showed you in the last week, Wall Street Journal, New York Times, Washington Post,
[1:04:01.760 --> 1:04:06.760]  local papers around the country, TV stations, Council on Foreign Relations,
[1:04:06.760 --> 1:04:12.760]  calling for a military coup against the president, and they said if he challenges the results
[1:04:12.760 --> 1:04:16.760]  of the election, which the Democrats say they're going to challenge, in any way,
[1:04:16.760 --> 1:04:22.760]  it's the 25th Amendment, and they want the military to remove the president,
[1:04:22.760 --> 1:04:29.760]  and that if any of the cabinet speaks out against it, they will be arrested.
[1:04:29.760 --> 1:04:33.760]  And if any of the military stands up, you'll be arrested.
[1:04:33.760 --> 1:04:38.760]  When they're in newspaper saying, we're going to take this president out,
[1:04:38.760 --> 1:04:44.760]  and if you go lay down to it, if you don't bow down to it, we're going to arrest you,
[1:04:44.760 --> 1:04:50.760]  you know you are far down the rat hole at that point.
[1:04:50.760 --> 1:04:56.760]  So I would just throw the point out to military, current and former officers, FBI agents,
[1:04:56.760 --> 1:05:00.760]  any of you, because I want to get your view on this.
[1:05:00.760 --> 1:05:02.760]  How do you go with what the legitimate government is?
[1:05:02.760 --> 1:05:04.760]  We know the globalists don't want America to exist.
[1:05:04.760 --> 1:05:06.760]  We know the Democrats steal elections.
[1:05:06.760 --> 1:05:09.760]  We know they're the ones involved in all the rigging and the crime and the Jesse Smolleting
[1:05:09.760 --> 1:05:12.760]  and the race warring and kill the police garbage.
[1:05:12.760 --> 1:05:15.760]  And we know our country is in the process of being overthrown
[1:05:15.760 --> 1:05:19.760]  by a multinational chai combat globalist combine.
[1:05:19.760 --> 1:05:23.760]  And we know that everywhere else is open for business, but America is horrible
[1:05:23.760 --> 1:05:28.760]  and we've got the most cases of COVID and we're the bad guys and we can never reopen.
[1:05:28.760 --> 1:05:31.760]  That's because we've got 100 times the testing literally of anybody else
[1:05:31.760 --> 1:05:33.760]  and it's almost all fake positives.
[1:05:33.760 --> 1:05:35.760]  That's why the death rates way down.
[1:05:35.760 --> 1:05:38.760]  Put those grassroots actually up if we can.
[1:05:38.760 --> 1:05:42.760]  But the infection rates way up because it's bull crap.
[1:05:42.760 --> 1:05:48.760]  And that's why Trump's come out with a giant report with over 50 times Fauci was wrong.
[1:05:48.760 --> 1:05:53.760]  And that's the process of first they sideline him as I told you they would do two months ago.
[1:05:53.760 --> 1:05:55.760]  They did that a few weeks later.
[1:05:55.760 --> 1:05:58.760]  And then Fauci didn't back down with Bill Gates funding.
[1:05:58.760 --> 1:06:02.760]  And so now Trump is hammering him and bringing out his lies.
[1:06:02.760 --> 1:06:04.760]  And you know what's going to come out next?
[1:06:04.760 --> 1:06:08.760]  How he owns the major patents.
[1:06:08.760 --> 1:06:15.760]  We're talking large pieces of them on four of the major vaccines, including the DNA vaccine
[1:06:15.760 --> 1:06:17.760]  that goes in and reprograms yourselves.
[1:06:17.760 --> 1:06:19.760]  That's not a vaccine.
[1:06:19.760 --> 1:06:22.760]  That's a cancer programmer.
[1:06:22.760 --> 1:06:32.760]  So good news that Trump's doing that, but the folks realize how big this is.
[1:06:32.760 --> 1:06:39.760]  Well, you know, cancel culture is going after Tucker Carlson and going after JK Rowling,
[1:06:39.760 --> 1:06:45.760]  going after everybody that doesn't completely bow to I guess the sterilization of our young boys
[1:06:45.760 --> 1:06:47.760]  in medical experiments. That's what the trans movement is.
[1:06:47.760 --> 1:06:50.760]  But now this just broke that way punnet.com.
[1:06:50.760 --> 1:06:52.760]  It's up on info wars.com.
[1:06:52.760 --> 1:06:59.760]  YouTube takes down Tucker Carlson video connecting terrorists Susan Rosenberg to BLM.
[1:06:59.760 --> 1:07:06.760]  And that's actually in my stack right over here was going to cover that today.
[1:07:06.760 --> 1:07:15.760]  Independent Sentinel.com, former weather underground leader handles BLM funds. Now that's a fact.
[1:07:15.760 --> 1:07:20.760]  And that came out a month ago.
[1:07:20.760 --> 1:07:24.760]  But when Tucker Carlson talks about it, that's not allowed.
[1:07:24.760 --> 1:07:28.760]  Remember when judicial watch.
[1:07:28.760 --> 1:07:34.760]  Last year exposed that Soros was funding the migrant waves and it was a fact.
[1:07:34.760 --> 1:07:37.760]  He's on the paperwork. He got awards for doing it.
[1:07:37.760 --> 1:07:40.760]  And they said you could never have that member of judicial watch the actual head of it.
[1:07:40.760 --> 1:07:44.760]  You always see Fenton. He's like one of the top guys, but the actual director.
[1:07:44.760 --> 1:07:51.760]  He was on and he was banned from Lou Dobbs's business show because they said it was fake news.
[1:07:51.760 --> 1:07:55.760]  It's like saying it's fake news that Coca-Cola cans are red.
[1:07:55.760 --> 1:07:59.760]  It's fake news that Trump's hair looks like an orangutan's.
[1:07:59.760 --> 1:08:06.760]  It's fake news that Hitler was a Nazi.
[1:08:06.760 --> 1:08:10.760]  So now Susan Rosenberg is VP of fundraising for BLM.
[1:08:10.760 --> 1:08:12.760]  She was most among the Democrats.
[1:08:12.760 --> 1:08:19.760]  She was charged for her role in 1983 bombing of the United States Capitol building and other targets.
[1:08:19.760 --> 1:08:22.760]  Convicted for explosives possession in 1985.
[1:08:22.760 --> 1:08:25.760]  She was sentenced to 58 years in prison.
[1:08:25.760 --> 1:08:29.760]  She was sprung by Bill Clinton. Remember? He pardoned her.
[1:08:29.760 --> 1:08:36.760]  Oh, Trump's the worst guy on earth for pardoning Roger Stone, a political prisoner.
[1:08:36.760 --> 1:08:42.760]  But Clinton pardoned drug dealers, money launderers,
[1:08:42.760 --> 1:08:50.760]  whether underground people and so YouTube, oh, YouTube now is starting to not just censor Alex Jones,
[1:08:50.760 --> 1:08:52.760]  but now Tucker Carlson and now President Trump.
[1:08:52.760 --> 1:08:56.760]  And so is Twitter because you can't tell a truth like that.
[1:08:56.760 --> 1:08:59.760]  Former Weather Underground leader handles BLM funds.
[1:08:59.760 --> 1:09:02.760]  This broke with Bill O'Reilly.
[1:09:02.760 --> 1:09:04.760]  Glad he pointed this out.
[1:09:04.760 --> 1:09:08.760]  Almost a month ago, Bill O'Reilly explained on his podcast this week the Black Lives Matter.
[1:09:08.760 --> 1:09:11.760]  A commonist organization has thought about George Soros and similar bad actors.
[1:09:11.760 --> 1:09:12.760]  The funding is very sketchy.
[1:09:12.760 --> 1:09:15.760]  Someone should investigate, but no one will.
[1:09:15.760 --> 1:09:20.760]  Well, Tucker Carlson did, ladies and gentlemen.
[1:09:20.760 --> 1:09:26.760]  And the founders of Black Lives Matter say they're Marxist-Leninist who believe in trans men.
[1:09:26.760 --> 1:09:29.760]  We need their main mission is to get rid of the nuclear family.
[1:09:29.760 --> 1:09:30.760]  This is an official statement.
[1:09:30.760 --> 1:09:35.760]  And cut Black men's genitals off with their little boys.
[1:09:35.760 --> 1:09:37.760]  What a cult.
[1:09:37.760 --> 1:09:40.760]  Our main mission is to get rid of the family.
[1:09:40.760 --> 1:09:41.760]  That will help Blacks.
[1:09:41.760 --> 1:09:45.760]  It helped them so much and cut the ones that we don't kill in the womb,
[1:09:45.760 --> 1:09:50.760]  chop their testicles off.
[1:09:50.760 --> 1:09:57.760]  And J.K. Rowling says, listen, I'm a big liberal, but this is a cult over here.
[1:09:57.760 --> 1:10:02.760]  They're grabbing autistic kids with hundreds of thousands and by 789 chopping their testicles off.
[1:10:02.760 --> 1:10:04.760]  Some are getting them chopped off, not just chemically.
[1:10:04.760 --> 1:10:06.760]  You have it and it stunts their growth and gives them cancer.
[1:10:06.760 --> 1:10:08.760]  My God, children can't make decisions.
[1:10:08.760 --> 1:10:10.760]  This is abuse.
[1:10:10.760 --> 1:10:17.760]  And now, boy, they want her destroyed because they've got to cancel the whole culture.
[1:10:17.760 --> 1:10:20.760]  And people say, well, it'll finally burn itself out.
[1:10:20.760 --> 1:10:24.760]  It'll get too ridiculous saying chess is racist and 2 plus 2 is racist, literally.
[1:10:24.760 --> 1:10:33.760]  And these are professors saying this and, you know, we're segregating the schools again because white people are bad.
[1:10:33.760 --> 1:10:42.760]  But no, if we keep capitulating, everyone keeps bowing like Chick-fil-A does now and everything,
[1:10:42.760 --> 1:10:43.760]  then there's no future.
[1:10:43.760 --> 1:10:50.760]  You know, Chick-fil-A's business doubled in one year when they said we're not able for staying closed on Sunday.
[1:10:50.760 --> 1:10:51.760]  And Hobby Lobby did the same thing.
[1:10:51.760 --> 1:10:55.760]  He said, hey, we don't push our religion on you, but we were off on Sunday.
[1:10:55.760 --> 1:10:58.760]  We're Christians.
[1:10:58.760 --> 1:11:02.760]  It's good to rest a day anyways.
[1:11:02.760 --> 1:11:09.760]  But now, again, Chick-fil-A's son has taken over and he is a candy-ass, probably being blackmailed.
[1:11:09.760 --> 1:11:18.760]  But look at this, buy-cott, Goya food sales surge as Trump supporters clean out store shelves.
[1:11:18.760 --> 1:11:20.760]  The silent majority finally strikes back.
[1:11:20.760 --> 1:11:23.760]  And we're going to play a little clip of this in a moment.
[1:11:23.760 --> 1:11:30.760]  But all the CEO did of this company, I bought their beans many times.
[1:11:30.760 --> 1:11:32.760]  Their beans were black beans were really good.
[1:11:32.760 --> 1:11:33.760]  Their pinto beans are good.
[1:11:33.760 --> 1:11:34.760]  I'm getting hungry.
[1:11:34.760 --> 1:11:35.760]  Kidney beans are good.
[1:11:35.760 --> 1:11:36.760]  They're all good.
[1:11:36.760 --> 1:11:37.760]  Their blackout beans are good.
[1:11:37.760 --> 1:11:38.760]  Well, I said black.
[1:11:38.760 --> 1:11:39.760]  I'm being racist.
[1:11:39.760 --> 1:11:46.760]  All he said was, we really thank this great president for getting all this extra food, record amounts of food to food banks.
[1:11:46.760 --> 1:11:47.760]  I saw some number.
[1:11:47.760 --> 1:11:49.760]  It's five times any previous record to food banks.
[1:11:49.760 --> 1:11:52.760]  And they're running out of the food because people are out of jobs.
[1:11:52.760 --> 1:11:55.760]  And most people I've talked to never could get on the computer.
[1:11:55.760 --> 1:11:59.760]  They could never be able to log in to actually get this supposed aid.
[1:11:59.760 --> 1:12:05.760]  You know, Bezos got 32 billion and Soros got a couple billion and all the Nike got a billion.
[1:12:05.760 --> 1:12:09.760]  And everybody else got all the ADL got a millions.
[1:12:09.760 --> 1:12:10.760]  The numbers vary.
[1:12:10.760 --> 1:12:13.760]  I saw a number of 33 million.
[1:12:13.760 --> 1:12:14.760]  But we went and checked.
[1:12:14.760 --> 1:12:16.760]  Oh, we don't get any money.
[1:12:16.760 --> 1:12:20.760]  I didn't really want it, but we went and checked.
[1:12:20.760 --> 1:12:23.760]  So we come back, we'll play that clip and then start going to your calls.
[1:12:23.760 --> 1:12:29.760]  This is the example of how far will it go where you can't thank the president for getting food to food banks?
[1:12:29.760 --> 1:12:31.760]  Because they want everybody to know you don't thank him.
[1:12:31.760 --> 1:12:32.760]  You don't support him.
[1:12:32.760 --> 1:12:36.760]  You let us, the cult members, tell you how to think and what to do.
[1:12:36.760 --> 1:12:37.760]  It's just insane.
[1:12:37.760 --> 1:12:42.760]  877-789-Alex, 877-789-2539.
[1:12:42.760 --> 1:12:47.760]  Your take on all this and more and what Trump needs to do next and how the enemy is going to strike back next.
[1:12:47.760 --> 1:13:05.760]  There's so many points.
[1:13:05.760 --> 1:13:09.760]  It's the end of the world as we know it and I don't feel fun.
[1:13:09.760 --> 1:13:20.760]  This entire takeover has been battle planned, blueprinted, war-gamed, field-martialed by the psychological war chiefs at the United Nations and the Fortune 100.
[1:13:20.760 --> 1:13:22.760]  This is the post-human takeover.
[1:13:22.760 --> 1:13:26.760]  The new skits tighter when you comply, not looser.
[1:13:26.760 --> 1:13:29.760]  The entire COVID-19 operation is a hoax.
[1:13:29.760 --> 1:13:35.760]  Now they admit the quote death numbers are dropping because those are fake, where they count people that died of something else.
[1:13:35.760 --> 1:13:37.760]  But it's all about how many cases there are.
[1:13:37.760 --> 1:13:40.760]  And now they're saying most of the population will get it.
[1:13:40.760 --> 1:13:43.760]  And then no one can go outside ever again.
[1:13:43.760 --> 1:13:45.760]  It's totally insane.
[1:13:45.760 --> 1:13:46.760]  It's a fraud.
[1:13:46.760 --> 1:13:48.760]  It's all a lie.
[1:13:48.760 --> 1:13:52.760]  There are many reasons that the globalist launch this planetary lockdown.
[1:13:52.760 --> 1:13:56.760]  The number one reason is it serves every one of their purposes.
[1:13:56.760 --> 1:14:01.760]  We've gone over those purposes many times here on air.
[1:14:01.760 --> 1:14:07.760]  The casual society, the surveillance system, global government, medical tyranny, forced inoculation.
[1:14:07.760 --> 1:14:14.760]  But the most important facet is it teaches us that we are obsolete, that we are non-essential.
[1:14:14.760 --> 1:14:23.760]  As we begin to witness automation computers and robots take over the jobs that people once had by design.
[1:14:23.760 --> 1:14:27.760]  This isn't like it's some advancement that we just fell into.
[1:14:27.760 --> 1:14:33.760]  It's been pre-planned, organized globally, and it's extremely predatory.
[1:14:33.760 --> 1:14:44.760]  And through governmental actuaries and tax programs and regulations, the central banks that control it all are able to pick the winners and the losers and consolidate power.
[1:14:44.760 --> 1:14:59.760]  This is the truest form of technocracy fascism.
[1:15:14.760 --> 1:15:23.760]  We're all truly blessed at the same time to have a leader like President Trump who was a builder.
[1:15:44.760 --> 1:15:52.760]  All right, I want to go to your phone calls here.
[1:15:52.760 --> 1:15:59.760]  I don't want to talk about what you think we should do next and why the globalists are going to strike back next.
[1:15:59.760 --> 1:16:07.760]  But I got to tell you, the way this is all going down is just beyond insane.
[1:16:07.760 --> 1:16:22.760]  And the way that the Democratic Party and the Psyops are trying to engineer chips onto the shoulders of black people and then onto the shoulders of white people to be these weird,
[1:16:22.760 --> 1:16:37.760]  virtue signaling minders that don't just grobble the black people, but also hin-peck at white people telling us how bad we are.
[1:16:37.760 --> 1:16:43.760]  It's just such a sick, weird, globalist program that they've come up with that just gets worse and worse and crazier and crazier,
[1:16:43.760 --> 1:16:50.760]  where the president pushes a food drive to get big corporations to give away hundreds of millions of dollars of food every month.
[1:16:50.760 --> 1:16:54.760]  And somebody says, thanks for doing this initiative, then they get boycotted.
[1:16:54.760 --> 1:17:04.760]  But the good news is people came back and said, no, we're all truly blessed at the same time to have and did not buy into it.
[1:17:04.760 --> 1:17:09.760]  So yeah, let's play that clip again. Let's cue that up again and play it.
[1:17:09.760 --> 1:17:11.760]  I guess the third time's the charm. Here it is.
[1:17:11.760 --> 1:17:19.760]  We're all truly blessed at the same time to have a leader like President Trump who was a builder.
[1:17:19.760 --> 1:17:24.760]  See, they don't want any type of solidarity. They don't want any type of Trump ever to do anything good.
[1:17:24.760 --> 1:17:27.760]  That's why everything he does, they turn it around into something bad.
[1:17:27.760 --> 1:17:32.760]  On the next clip I want to go to, then we're going to your phone calls, is Maxine Waters.
[1:17:32.760 --> 1:17:39.760]  Trump and supporters ensuring blacks do not rise to any level of influence and power.
[1:17:39.760 --> 1:17:48.760]  Now you talk about total projection, everything the Democrats do and the whole Planned Parenthood Combine have set up.
[1:17:48.760 --> 1:17:54.760]  Is about making sure that these people stay under their control.
[1:17:54.760 --> 1:17:57.760]  That's the Admit a Democrat plan to make everybody dependent.
[1:17:57.760 --> 1:18:04.760]  And so when they turn around and say that about Trump and all his supporters, despite Trump doubling funding to black colleges,
[1:18:04.760 --> 1:18:12.760]  massively increasing incentives for black home businesses, doing prison reform, you'd think he was in the KKK.
[1:18:12.760 --> 1:18:21.760]  It means nothing because the Democrats have been preying on black people and Trump is literally trying to help black people get free of this.
[1:18:21.760 --> 1:18:30.760]  And so that's why Maxine Waters and these other monsters, monstrous racists against black people, these are handlers.
[1:18:30.760 --> 1:18:40.760]  These are Judas Goats. These are the true masters working with the globalist of the black slaves, truly, truly sick.
[1:18:40.760 --> 1:18:43.760]  So here's Mad Maxine.
[1:19:10.760 --> 1:19:33.760]  Well, I think you said it earlier today when you talked about this need for Trump and those who support him to want to have absolute power
[1:19:33.760 --> 1:19:46.760]  and to believe that it is their right and their responsibility to ensure that blacks and people of color and others do not rise to any level of influence and power
[1:19:46.760 --> 1:19:52.760]  significant that would cause them not to be in total charge of this country.
[1:19:52.760 --> 1:20:03.760]  So that young man is typical of so many young black men and women who have been sent to jail, who have been convicted, who served long sentences.
[1:20:03.760 --> 1:20:11.760]  This justice system is broken. It has never really been in our favor and it has basically been responsible.
[1:20:11.760 --> 1:20:15.760]  But back it up to the tweet for TV viewers and I'll read it for radio listeners.
[1:20:15.760 --> 1:20:26.760]  Roger Stone, and you can almost disagree with some of this, his plan is so radical to open up the prisons, I think it would increase crime, but definitely a lot of nonviolent people need to be let out of jail.
[1:20:26.760 --> 1:20:28.760]  And I'm for that.
[1:20:28.760 --> 1:20:42.760]  But it's Roger Stone, not Jared Kushner, that beat the drum for 20 years to get Trump to get rid of the Clinton era rules, giving black people triple the jail sentences of white people and I agree with getting rid of those parts.
[1:20:42.760 --> 1:20:58.760]  We have them put Roger Stone up there saying, look, this white dude got out when he did all these terrible things and this black person is in jail for doing not as much is just absolutely crazy.
[1:20:58.760 --> 1:21:00.760]  Let's back that video up if we can.
[1:21:00.760 --> 1:21:03.760]  I just want to show TV viewers just to still it.
[1:21:03.760 --> 1:21:05.760]  The tweet I'm talking about, so I can read it to them.
[1:21:05.760 --> 1:21:07.760]  It's shown several times in the video you were showing.
[1:21:07.760 --> 1:21:12.760]  So, again, there it is.
[1:21:12.760 --> 1:21:17.760]  Roger Stone found guilty by jury of seven federal criminal counts, no jail time.
[1:21:17.760 --> 1:21:25.760]  Khalif Browder accused of stealing a backpack, couldn't post bail, spent three years in Rikers awaiting trial, ultimately committed suicide after release.
[1:21:25.760 --> 1:21:27.760]  We have two justice systems this country.
[1:21:27.760 --> 1:21:29.760]  You know, I don't know that case is accurate.
[1:21:29.760 --> 1:21:37.760]  I don't know the background on it, but I see cases where people have committed dozens of robberies, hundreds of crimes.
[1:21:37.760 --> 1:21:38.760]  They've been in jail over 100 times.
[1:21:38.760 --> 1:21:39.760]  They're black.
[1:21:39.760 --> 1:21:40.760]  They're white.
[1:21:40.760 --> 1:21:42.760]  They get out.
[1:21:42.760 --> 1:21:44.760]  So are there miscarriages of justice?
[1:21:44.760 --> 1:21:46.760]  Absolutely.
[1:21:46.760 --> 1:21:55.760]  But to then sit there and say it's Roger Stone's fault when he's an advocate for reforming the prisons and believe me, those people on that show know that.
[1:21:55.760 --> 1:22:00.760]  Okay, I'm going to go to break for the next hour and 10 minutes after that, we'll take nothing but calls.
[1:22:00.760 --> 1:22:10.760]  We're going to go to Sandra, David, Jim, Steve, Nebin, Nelson, Leo, Darius, Cedric, Justin, and many others.
[1:22:10.760 --> 1:22:13.760]  Right when we come back, I'm just going to briefly throw this out there.
[1:22:13.760 --> 1:22:16.760]  I've not extended the sale like I've done the last two times.
[1:22:16.760 --> 1:22:31.760]  For more days, because it's a gimmick, we are selling out of these items, we are having trouble getting a lot of the items, nine of our products are either massively delayed, or we've had to discontinue several of them because we cannot get the ingredients.
[1:22:31.760 --> 1:22:36.760]  Alpha Power, a great seller, can't get the proprietary ingredient.
[1:22:36.760 --> 1:22:46.760]  The ultimate bone broth cannot get some of the key ingredients, their shortages, I've been waiting six months to try to reorder it, and then now they're not even sure.
[1:22:46.760 --> 1:22:49.760]  So we got our money back.
[1:22:49.760 --> 1:22:51.760]  There's actually several others around to discontinue.
[1:22:51.760 --> 1:22:57.760]  There's a lot of the items you like we can't get from top manufacturers.
[1:22:57.760 --> 1:23:05.760]  I've always been diverse and a lot of manufacturers from products, but this is serious in the economy, the things that are going on.
[1:23:05.760 --> 1:23:19.760]  And so that's why we got limited amounts of all the things that were sold out, bodies, ultimate turmeric formula, winter sun, vitamin D3 and K under the tongue, vaso beats, vitamin mineral fusion, lung cleanse, Revival Shield X3.
[1:23:19.760 --> 1:23:21.760]  I'm not sure I can get real Red Pill, Red Pill Plus again.
[1:23:21.760 --> 1:23:24.760]  This may be the end of that product because they're so backed up.
[1:23:24.760 --> 1:23:26.760]  So that's about to sell out.
[1:23:26.760 --> 1:23:34.760]  All of them, store-wide free shipping, double Patriot points, and 50 to 60% off, but it has to end today because a bunch of these are about to sell out.
[1:23:34.760 --> 1:23:37.760]  So I just can't sit there and just completely sell it out.
[1:23:37.760 --> 1:23:40.760]  I need to hold on to it because it's going to be a while until we get more in if ever.
[1:23:40.760 --> 1:23:41.760]  Get your orders in.
[1:23:41.760 --> 1:23:43.760]  The supply chain is breaking down.
[1:23:43.760 --> 1:23:46.760]  We have all this in stock right now, ready to ship.
[1:23:46.760 --> 1:23:48.760]  It's been on air in 26 years.
[1:23:48.760 --> 1:23:55.760]  Starting about 24 years ago, I began to get calls from major Hollywood directors, producers, actors.
[1:23:55.760 --> 1:23:58.760]  They wanted to meet with me and they said, what is your formal education?
[1:23:58.760 --> 1:24:07.760]  And I said, well, really, nothing but a few years of college. They said, well, how are you one of the best science fiction or cultural writers we've ever heard?
[1:24:07.760 --> 1:24:11.760]  The stuff you come up with is just unbelievable.
[1:24:11.760 --> 1:24:12.760]  We'd like you to be in movies.
[1:24:12.760 --> 1:24:13.760]  We'd like you to write with us.
[1:24:13.760 --> 1:24:15.760]  We'd like you to do voiceovers.
[1:24:15.760 --> 1:24:16.760]  You're just a Renaissance man.
[1:24:16.760 --> 1:24:20.760]  Folks know I was in some movies and Harry Shearer made statements like that and a lot of others.
[1:24:20.760 --> 1:24:21.760]  I'm not bragging.
[1:24:21.760 --> 1:24:22.760]  I kept explaining to them.
[1:24:22.760 --> 1:24:26.760]  I said, do you understand I didn't come up with any of this?
[1:24:26.760 --> 1:24:31.760]  I'm reading globalist MIT white papers and futurist documents.
[1:24:31.760 --> 1:24:33.760]  And they would just laugh at me and say, oh, no way.
[1:24:33.760 --> 1:24:35.760]  Then I would give them the documents.
[1:24:35.760 --> 1:24:37.760]  They would get very, very scared.
[1:24:37.760 --> 1:24:41.760]  The next time I saw them in a few months and say, and you're right, this is just topic.
[1:24:41.760 --> 1:24:43.760]  Folks, I didn't make any of this up.
[1:24:43.760 --> 1:24:44.760]  Okay, it's real.
[1:24:44.760 --> 1:24:45.760]  It's real.
[1:24:45.760 --> 1:24:56.760]  The bad news is Western governments have totally let multinational big tech bring in communist Chinese style total net surveillance censorship with AI.
[1:24:56.760 --> 1:25:01.760]  The good news is they had to do that to carry out this world government COVID takeover.
[1:25:01.760 --> 1:25:10.760]  This planetary corporate reset that COVID covers for because the truth is powerful and will defeat them and will smash them.
[1:25:10.760 --> 1:25:17.760]  And the good news is there are still sites like band.video, newswars.com, infowars.com,
[1:25:17.760 --> 1:25:22.760]  Paul Watson Sites Summit.News, and a lot of other great sites that are getting massive traffic.
[1:25:22.760 --> 1:25:31.760]  Thanks to you and your word of mouth that is king, that is queen, that is the master of our own destinies.
[1:25:31.760 --> 1:25:36.760]  Ladies and gentlemen, there is a war on reality, a war on civilization, a war on our health,
[1:25:36.760 --> 1:25:43.760]  a war on our economy, but being aware of it and standing up to it and speaking out against it will defeat it.
[1:25:43.760 --> 1:25:46.760]  So take action or be slaves.
[1:25:46.760 --> 1:25:51.760]  As the years go by, it gets harder and harder to keep up with your body's nutritional needs.
[1:25:51.760 --> 1:26:00.760]  With changes in diet, unnatural ingredients and stress, you may not be able to get all the necessary nutrients, amino acids, vitamins and minerals needed daily.

[1:27:04.760 --> 1:27:15.760]  All right.
[1:27:15.760 --> 1:27:19.760]  The rest of this hour and most of the next hour, then I've got a special report I need to get to.
[1:27:19.760 --> 1:27:28.760]  We're going to be taking your phone calls. I really appreciate you all calling. I appreciate you holding any subject you want to raise, any topic, any angle.
[1:27:28.760 --> 1:27:37.760]  We're going to go to it, but I've got a bunch of COVID-19 hoax news I want to hit. They're admitting the lockdown is permanent.
[1:27:37.760 --> 1:27:43.760]  They're going to have a list of demands for you to be able to go outside or have a job or go into a company.
[1:27:43.760 --> 1:27:56.760]  They're just training the public and the companies to carry out the enforcement right now. It's all laid out and we've got to stop it. This is the takeover.
[1:27:56.760 --> 1:28:03.760]  Some good news though. Trump is sidelining and now going after Fauci and that's the key. You've got to not just get rid of these people and let them run around lying on the news.
[1:28:03.760 --> 1:28:10.760]  You've got to destroy them with their lies, their track record of being false on purpose and their profiteering off the vaccine.
[1:28:10.760 --> 1:28:24.760]  They say is the only savior with the media lockstep not telling you about therapeutics, vitamins or minerals. It is unbelievably evil and they should pay for it or they'll continue to carry out these operations.
[1:28:24.760 --> 1:28:37.760]  I've talked to Roger Stone today and I have a lot of inside baseball and I'm just going to leave it at that. He would be here. He would be on handy tonight if he's able to, but we're not sure.
[1:28:37.760 --> 1:28:46.760]  If he does do handy tonight, he'll be here tomorrow, but he's not yet sure. There's a lot of stuff behind the scenes I'm deliberately to get into. I'm going to leave it at that.
[1:28:46.760 --> 1:29:05.760]  There's also some very exciting things going on in Texas on multiple fronts. And I can tell you that if you thought there was an exodus back in exodus in the Old Testament out of Pharaoh's Egypt by Moses and the Israelites.
[1:29:05.760 --> 1:29:18.760]  There is a second great exodus out of Southern California and soon it will be on the news, but Elon Musk is moving here. A lot of other people are moving here and they told me everybody else is moving here.
[1:29:18.760 --> 1:29:36.760]  And there's going to be, well, let's just leave it at that. A lot of people in studio here and a lot of people moving chess pieces around the board who are going to be speaking out in the near future. A lot of big, big, big names.
[1:29:36.760 --> 1:29:51.760]  Because there's, I mean, the New World Order, the Democrats locking everything down, trying to create a race war, the homeless everywhere, the fentanyl everywhere. It's very clear to people that are real liberals that the left is cancer and that they have destroyed everything and are trying to destroy things.
[1:29:51.760 --> 1:30:07.760]  So there's a major, major movement turning against them right now. Okay. Sandra, Dave, Jim, Steve, Nevin, Nelson, Leo, Darius, Shedrick, Justin, we're going to go to all of you.
[1:30:07.760 --> 1:30:13.760]  Who should we go to first? Let's go to Sandra in Colorado. Thanks for holding her on the air, Sandra.
[1:30:13.760 --> 1:30:15.760]  Hi, Alex. How are you?
[1:30:15.760 --> 1:30:21.760]  You know, it's like the old best of times, worst of times. Tell it to cities. A lot of good, a lot of bad. How are you?
[1:30:21.760 --> 1:30:36.760]  I'm fine. Thanks. I'm trying to stay sane. So I must be a real liberal. I have voted Democrat all my life. I was telling the guy who answered the phone that I'm realizing with this COVID thing that there is no real, true, right or left.
[1:30:36.760 --> 1:30:46.760]  There's only critically thinking people who can actually see this thing for what it is. I started questioning it. You know, I took it seriously at first.
[1:30:46.760 --> 1:30:56.760]  My guy and I prepared for things. And then as things went on, because I was not only just watching every news piece on the, you know, on TV, I was also reading everything.
[1:30:56.760 --> 1:31:07.760]  Including CDC, CDPHE. And I started questioning, you know, shortly, like right in April, the numbers and everything. And I haven't always listened to you because I haven't always liked you.
[1:31:07.760 --> 1:31:15.760]  But when I met this man, he kind of turned me on to you. I don't listen to you every day. But when I do listen to you, there are things I agree with, things I don't.
[1:31:15.760 --> 1:31:17.760]  So two questions.
[1:31:17.760 --> 1:31:26.760]  No, I'm not a, I'm not a leftist. So I love people that agree and disagree and have great debates. So absolutely. In fact, I disagree sometimes with things I say in hindsight.
[1:31:26.760 --> 1:31:35.760]  So welcome to the broadcast. We love you. We appreciate you. I was the same way. I saw the apocalyptic images out of China, welding people in their homes, shooting women at checkpoints.
[1:31:35.760 --> 1:31:42.760]  I got really concerned. And scientists said it is manmade. We now know why it's manmade. So it spreads fast so that everybody gets it.
[1:31:42.760 --> 1:31:49.760]  So everybody is then suspect. So everybody's got to be given a quote inoculation. And notice they say now, oh, you don't get well from this.
[1:31:49.760 --> 1:31:59.760]  Even if you have antibodies, you still got to get the vaccine. It's all made up crap. This is them turning epidemiology and virology on its head.
[1:31:59.760 --> 1:32:05.760]  All the normal rules of science are suspended. I mean, this, this is their big move. Go ahead.
[1:32:05.760 --> 1:32:12.760]  Right. So my question is to hold and then I got to run because I have a, I have to rush in and go to an appointment.
[1:32:12.760 --> 1:32:13.760]  Understand.
[1:32:13.760 --> 1:32:21.760]  So we have a governor that's gone completely rogue. I have watched his, I voted for him, regretting it now.
[1:32:21.760 --> 1:32:29.760]  I've watched every one of his press conferences and I've seen him evolve and transmogify and get more and more emboldened.
[1:32:29.760 --> 1:32:35.760]  This last press conference, he was asked about why he just doesn't do a state mandate.
[1:32:35.760 --> 1:32:47.760]  And from his answer, I surmise that the reason he's not doing it just yet is because he hasn't got the authorities all on board, meaning the police force in all of the counties that could enforce it.
[1:32:47.760 --> 1:32:58.760]  So that concerns me for one. And the question I wanted to ask you, why can't Trump do more in this case to reel in some of these governors?
[1:32:58.760 --> 1:33:04.760]  And I don't know enough about, you know, I know that's what it is. It's a mutiny of globalist governors and blue states.
[1:33:04.760 --> 1:33:09.760]  But also now you see the governor of Texas getting on board with the fraud of Fauci, with the fraud of the U.N.
[1:33:09.760 --> 1:33:12.760]  Because all the big corporations are behind it. They're scared to go against it.
[1:33:12.760 --> 1:33:19.760]  And a lot of them, like the governor of Michigan gets off on it. And so this is a giant power grab.
[1:33:19.760 --> 1:33:28.760]  Well, ours too, Governor Polis, you can just watch him and he's just like, wear a damn mask, you know, in a fight and no parting. This is going to be the summer without parties.
[1:33:28.760 --> 1:33:32.760]  And he talks to us in a parental tone and he keeps shaming.
[1:33:32.760 --> 1:33:37.760]  Oh, yeah. No, ma'am, ma'am, you're seeing naked authoritarianism and you're totally right. It's not about left and right.
[1:33:37.760 --> 1:33:44.760]  It's about science and common sense and people that are lying. They lied and said 2.5 million dead.
[1:33:44.760 --> 1:33:49.760]  They put the names of people that died of other things on the covid list. Most of the tests are false.
[1:33:49.760 --> 1:33:55.760]  They're on the news saying the numbers of deaths are skyrocketing. They're not. Exactly. It's a total fraud.
[1:33:55.760 --> 1:34:00.760]  God bless you. I appreciate your call. She's seeing arrogant authoritarianism.
[1:34:00.760 --> 1:34:07.760]  Remember the mayor of LA goes, normally snitches get, well, you know what, I won't say it, but now you get rewards.
[1:34:07.760 --> 1:34:19.760]  Taddle on people. It's a sick joke. It's martial law. It's teaching you to stay in your house and an app on your phone tells you when you can go out.
[1:34:19.760 --> 1:34:26.760]  And the pushback is now here. Stop complying. Are there real pneumonia? Hell, yes.
[1:34:26.760 --> 1:34:30.760]  I'll cover it next hour. Are there all these weird mystery illnesses now? Yes.
[1:34:30.760 --> 1:34:37.760]  Did people point out to me three months ago that, hey, you know, you had Dr. Group on two and a half, three years ago.
[1:34:37.760 --> 1:34:45.760]  And he showed documents where 5G in China was causing an autoimmune response in the lungs and people think they were dying, but there was no liquid.
[1:34:45.760 --> 1:34:49.760]  And I called Group up and he goes, yeah, that's why I won't talk to you. That's why I won't come on. I love you, brother.
[1:34:49.760 --> 1:34:58.760]  But they threatened him really bad. And he said he didn't understand why it was that at the time, but he hit the key.
[1:34:58.760 --> 1:35:09.760]  This electromagnetic radiation system is getting so powerful that it's definitely exacerbating autoimmune responses in the lungs.
[1:35:09.760 --> 1:35:15.760]  And so what David Ike said about 5G is true. It's really exacerbating it.
[1:35:15.760 --> 1:35:19.760]  I mean, we've got all the reports. Folks, you can't make this stuff up.
[1:35:19.760 --> 1:35:26.760]  I mean, this is just a mass awakening because it's about survival. It's about you give your 18-month-old son a shot at the doctor.
[1:35:26.760 --> 1:35:30.760]  They have a convulsion they're never talking in. You're a mother. You know the shot did it.
[1:35:30.760 --> 1:35:35.760]  It's like a honey bee stings your son. He has a convulsion and becomes autistic from blood on the brain.
[1:35:35.760 --> 1:35:43.760]  You know he had brain damage from a convulsion from an autoimmune response.
[1:35:43.760 --> 1:35:54.760]  A cobra bites you. How'd they know in Africa or in India a thousand years ago that a cobra would kill you because a cobra bites you and you die?
[1:35:54.760 --> 1:35:58.760]  All right, we did one call that second. I'm going to take five calls next second.
[1:35:58.760 --> 1:36:04.760]  Five calls next second. We're going to go to Cedric, Darius, and Nelson.
[1:36:04.760 --> 1:36:07.760]  Then we'll get to everybody else on the other side of that.
[1:36:07.760 --> 1:36:14.760]  But again, it's all a lie. You say, well, then why don't they care because they've gotten away with Russiagate and all the other stuff.
[1:36:14.760 --> 1:36:20.760]  And the 5G and the New World Order and shipping the drugs in and the money laundering and the big mega banks have stolen tens of trillions of dollars.
[1:36:20.760 --> 1:36:25.760]  And they believe the world's theirs and they believe we're just walking around tearing up their resources.
[1:36:25.760 --> 1:36:31.760]  They wouldn't all look like Versailles or something. There's a big New World Order plan. We're not in it.
[1:36:31.760 --> 1:36:37.760]  And I know that sounds crazy and frightening, but Wall Street Journal said dreaming of the end of humans.
[1:36:37.760 --> 1:36:43.760]  That was two weeks ago. This is their religion. They're psychotic.
[1:36:43.760 --> 1:36:50.760]  Much of the United States bureaucracy, all of Hollywood and most of our media is under international banking control.
[1:36:50.760 --> 1:36:56.760]  The United Nations was set up by the Rothschilds and Rockefellers on record to carry out this operation.
[1:36:56.760 --> 1:37:02.760]  Now, under the guise of medical security, they're bringing us medical charity.
[1:37:02.760 --> 1:37:08.760]  And we see much of the federal government, the Democrats, the Republicans, all saying, except for Trump and a few people,
[1:37:08.760 --> 1:37:14.760]  that we need a nationwide force mask mandate to make everyone wear a mask.
[1:37:14.760 --> 1:37:19.760]  Even though just months ago we had the Surgeon General and others say, don't wear a mask. It's all fraud.
[1:37:19.760 --> 1:37:24.760]  Now they say you must wear a mask. It's a sign of slavery. It's a sign of submission.
[1:37:24.760 --> 1:37:30.760]  I know you as listeners understand that. We need sheriffs and county commissioners and city councils and others to stand up and say,
[1:37:30.760 --> 1:37:37.760]  we are sanctuary cities for reality and for state and local sovereignty against the globalist.
[1:37:37.760 --> 1:37:43.760]  This isn't the federal government taking over. It's the UN through the federal government and we as American citizens must say no.
[1:37:43.760 --> 1:37:52.760]  Americans have had freedom for so long and most Americans were born into such docile times compared to the rest of history
[1:37:52.760 --> 1:37:54.760]  that we really have a blind spot for tyranny.
[1:37:54.760 --> 1:38:01.760]  We don't appreciate the American way truth, justice, due process, the right to self-defense, private property, because we've had it so long
[1:38:01.760 --> 1:38:04.760]  and we just think that's how the rest of the world is.
[1:38:04.760 --> 1:38:10.760]  Ladies and gentlemen, the renaissance, the social contract that's 500 years old to try to build up humanity
[1:38:10.760 --> 1:38:16.760]  and try to believe in humanity and to try to empower the weak as well as the strong is something the West invented
[1:38:16.760 --> 1:38:18.760]  and that's what made our modern world.
[1:38:18.760 --> 1:38:24.760]  That's now been hijacked by the technocrats, by the globalists who say humans are ugly and bad for the earth
[1:38:24.760 --> 1:38:33.760]  and we need to be culled and dumbed down and put into subgroups that the elites dominate, manipulate and command even if we're even lucky enough to stay alive.
[1:38:33.760 --> 1:38:42.760]  And that's what COVID-19 is, a global UN revolution against free humanity, against your family, against prosperity and against your future.
[1:38:42.760 --> 1:38:45.760]  If you don't stand up and fight, you deserve what you get.
[1:38:45.760 --> 1:38:54.760]  A lot of you have been listening for more than 20 years and if you go back to those shows, we laid out the AI takeover plan, the tracking of cell phones,
[1:38:54.760 --> 1:39:04.760]  how programmed master computers would manipulate control society, how they'd be able to not just predict large groups of human movements and activities
[1:39:04.760 --> 1:39:09.760]  but even predict what individuals would do and then once you could predict what individuals were going to be doing,
[1:39:09.760 --> 1:39:18.760]  you could add stimuli through the AI systems, through the computers, through digital billboards, through face scanning, through the social credit score
[1:39:18.760 --> 1:39:21.760]  to control people and make them act like you wanted to.
[1:39:21.760 --> 1:39:31.760]  But when we cover that, the media would attack us and say we were making it up, it was a conspiracy theory even though it was in the actual corporate level blueprint documents.
[1:39:31.760 --> 1:39:39.760]  Well, the next level of the blueprint documents explained to us that they are setting up this control system to make humans obsolete and phase us out
[1:39:39.760 --> 1:39:45.760]  and it's something about a thousand times crazier than what Hitler planned, so we might want to dismantle the system now.
[1:39:45.760 --> 1:39:55.760]  As men age, they often experience a slowdown in vitality, energy and overall wellness.
[1:39:55.760 --> 1:40:02.760]  And that's why we made one of our most popular formulas to date, Super Male Vitality,
[1:40:02.760 --> 1:40:11.760]  specifically designed to assist the body in regulating proper balance to create superior vitality in males.
[1:40:11.760 --> 1:40:22.760]  Now look, this unique formula promotes your body's own natural responses and it contains no synthetic chemicals and no unwanted additives.
[1:40:22.760 --> 1:40:35.760]  Yes, we're talking about ancient wisdom combined with modern technology, working together in perfect synchronicity to help you get the most out of this herb-packed formula.
[1:40:35.760 --> 1:40:41.760]  So what are you waiting for? Go to the InfoWars store, never been a better time than right now.
[1:40:41.760 --> 1:40:47.760]  Super Male Vitality at InfoWarsStore.com
[1:40:47.760 --> 1:40:56.760]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[1:40:56.760 --> 1:41:09.760]  Here we are on this Monday edition. I have studied the globalists in depth.
[1:41:09.760 --> 1:41:15.760]  I know their next move, I understand their philosophies, how they operate, they are in a massive scaling up operation right now.
[1:41:15.760 --> 1:41:23.760]  That's why I said COVID-19 is only the carrier for a whole family of viruses that are going to roll out against us, each one more deadly than the last.
[1:41:23.760 --> 1:41:27.760]  Now Bill Gates has come out and said exactly that.
[1:41:27.760 --> 1:41:37.760]  Yes, it's a plan. We're not in it. But there's ways to counter it. Now they're announcing all these new deadly COVID mutations, all this new bird flu, new swine flu, new pneumonia.
[1:41:37.760 --> 1:41:45.760]  But don't worry, they'll keep you locked down forever. You've submitted well. You've passed the test, so now the real chains are going on.
[1:41:45.760 --> 1:41:49.760]  But actually people aren't submitting. They're getting pissed off. They're waking up.
[1:41:49.760 --> 1:41:53.760]  All right, catch 22. If I go to you quick and move on to the next person, we'll get to everybody.
[1:41:53.760 --> 1:41:58.760]  But you won't get a lot of time, like the last caller I gave her five minutes. Great caller. We've got to give each person about a minute.
[1:41:58.760 --> 1:42:01.760]  Cedric in Alabama, love you. You're on the air. Welcome.
[1:42:01.760 --> 1:42:03.760]  Hey Alex, how you doing?
[1:42:03.760 --> 1:42:07.760]  Man, I tell you, I'm definitely fighting as hard as I can. This is getting crazy.
[1:42:07.760 --> 1:42:11.760]  Well, this is amazing. Two things we've got to do as the American people.
[1:42:11.760 --> 1:42:21.760]  One, we have to realize that we the people are the solution period. It's not President Trump. It's not our elected officials. Their power comes from us.
[1:42:21.760 --> 1:42:28.760]  The first thing we need to do is continue to shine the light on COVID corruption.
[1:42:28.760 --> 1:42:37.760]  Keep using their weapons against them. The World Health Organization stated a symptomatic person spreading COVID-19 is very rare.
[1:42:37.760 --> 1:42:44.760]  The CDC has said the exact same thing. Look at your State Department of Public Health numbers.
[1:42:44.760 --> 1:42:54.760]  In Alabama, for example, since this stuff began to be reported, only 45 persons have died because of COVID.
[1:42:54.760 --> 1:43:02.760]  I didn't say underlining issues. Go back to the CDC guidelines on COVID death. They're very liberal.
[1:43:02.760 --> 1:43:12.760]  Also, the second thing we need to do, and this comes from President Trump and our elected officials, we have to shift the focus back to America first.
[1:43:12.760 --> 1:43:17.760]  They are trying to hijack this agenda. They're trying to hijack the narrative.
[1:43:17.760 --> 1:43:23.760]  By the way, you're right. They've said, oh, we're not America first in production or in oil or in success.
[1:43:23.760 --> 1:43:32.760]  Now we're first in COVID with the bureaucracies all over and flooding the numbers falsely as an open conspiracy to blame Trump and America. You're damn right.
[1:43:32.760 --> 1:43:39.760]  Right. And we have, we, the people are the solution. We have to make our public officials shift that focus back.
[1:43:39.760 --> 1:43:48.760]  What can we do? We can start sounding the alarm about sanctuary cities. Use that funding to rebuild America.
[1:43:48.760 --> 1:43:56.760]  President Trump can use sanctuary city funding by hundreds of billions of dollars, put it in these inner city communities.
[1:43:56.760 --> 1:44:10.760]  That way the Democrats have to stand up and justify what they're doing pitting black Americans up against immigrants that they're bringing in for their support later to undercut black Americans.
[1:44:10.760 --> 1:44:15.760]  Oh, absolutely. They know black Americans waking up. That's why they're accelerating bringing in the immigrants than trying to brainwash them.
[1:44:15.760 --> 1:44:27.760]  Incredible points, Cedric. I'm glad that Trump's starting to really throw Fauci under the bus. He deserves it. Fauci needs to be indicted for his insider trading and for his profiting off the vaccines.
[1:44:27.760 --> 1:44:36.760]  Absolutely. All these criminals need to be brought on charges because this is treason. This is not about Democrat or Republican.
[1:44:36.760 --> 1:44:45.760]  This is about globalism versus Americanism. And until the American people realize that, they can see through the fog of war.
[1:44:45.760 --> 1:44:54.760]  You can, you can size up these public officials. Do you support America, America first, or do you support a demonic, globalistic, anti-black?
[1:44:54.760 --> 1:45:00.760]  Absolutely. Cedric, call back again. What an incredible caller. Two amazing callers in a row. Darius, listen to that guy for an hour. We got to go.
[1:45:00.760 --> 1:45:03.760]  Darius and Marilyn, you're on the air. Welcome.
[1:45:03.760 --> 1:45:07.760]  How are you doing? How's it going? Fighting as hard as I can. How are you doing, sir?
[1:45:07.760 --> 1:45:17.760]  All good, brother. I want to talk about when COVID pretty much first started and I got activated March 16, 2020 here in Baltimore.
[1:45:17.760 --> 1:45:28.760]  When it first started, they said we didn't have to wear masks and all that stuff like that. And we had a whole company of guys that were together for a month, about three months.
[1:45:28.760 --> 1:45:35.760]  And we, we didn't wear masks. We were together. We were pretty much holed up and everything like that from 19 to 40 years old.
[1:45:35.760 --> 1:45:43.760]  Our first start was about 55. And we were together the whole time and no COVID, no, no one got sick or anything like that.
[1:45:43.760 --> 1:45:54.760]  We went out and did missions. We went to the convention centers that helped set up the 2,000 beds that were in there. Only like three or four people even came in there.
[1:45:54.760 --> 1:45:59.760]  The whole time that we had to set up for three months before we started tearing down everything.
[1:45:59.760 --> 1:46:09.760]  But the one thing that we did do the most that we saw was we handed out a lot of food because people were suffering from not having a job and stuff like that.
[1:46:09.760 --> 1:46:22.760]  So this whole COVID situation is really hurting the American people. It's not hurting those CNN liberals and MSNBC who've been working the whole time and stuff like that, making money.
[1:46:22.760 --> 1:46:32.760]  Well, Darius, you said it. I have talked to so many waitresses and barbers and beauticians and, you know, folks that are just making a living with their families.
[1:46:32.760 --> 1:46:38.760]  And they didn't get any money when they got laid off and they're going bankrupt and they're losing their car and they don't have food for their kids.
[1:46:38.760 --> 1:46:44.760]  And people that have never had to go to a food bank are going to the food bank. They try to get to the welfare office for the first time in their life.
[1:46:44.760 --> 1:46:50.760]  There's lines around the block. The DMV has been shut down. My daughter has been 16 for almost a year.
[1:46:50.760 --> 1:46:57.760]  She can't even go to do a driver's test. And the country has been brought into a total standstill over this.
[1:46:57.760 --> 1:47:04.760]  But go back to what you said, because I talked to people inside the government, inside the military, from the highest level down to the lowest level.
[1:47:04.760 --> 1:47:13.760]  And I was talking to an individual high up in Dyncor. And he said they built five facilities and there were other groups doing it in New York, working with the military.
[1:47:13.760 --> 1:47:22.760]  And that no one that he knew of ever went to one of those facilities or the hospital ships. So remember, we're told it was record numbers.
[1:47:22.760 --> 1:47:30.760]  Again, that was all a lie. And when we first started exposing the empty hospitals, they'd have local news showing cars going in and they'd show people in hazmats.
[1:47:30.760 --> 1:47:38.760]  Oh, there's big lines. Turned out they were fake lines, fake people. They confirmed they faked it in New Jersey, New York, California.
[1:47:38.760 --> 1:47:44.760]  The criminal evil. And now they're faking stories about one year olds dying and stuff. None of it's true.
[1:47:44.760 --> 1:47:51.760]  And they've got NBC reporters staging that they've got COVID. You got the cameraman behind the camera, not wearing the mask, but the person on camera is.
[1:47:51.760 --> 1:48:00.760]  You got a woman on an empty beach wearing a mask. They're all in bed. How do they get so many people to join on and be liars, my friend?
[1:48:00.760 --> 1:48:09.760]  And that you're absolutely right, Mr. Jones, because when it first started, I remember here in Maryland, they said, you didn't have to wear mask whatsoever.
[1:48:09.760 --> 1:48:14.760]  And that they didn't work because they don't. They don't stop buying these little masks that people are wearing.
[1:48:14.760 --> 1:48:20.760]  And then all of a sudden they said, oh, you was managed where you have to wear a mask and you go inside of stores and all that stuff like that.
[1:48:20.760 --> 1:48:24.760]  And then once the lockdown started, it was like, okay, you don't have to wear a mask.
[1:48:24.760 --> 1:48:31.760]  But then all of a sudden they say, oh, you have to wear mask everywhere you at, everywhere you go, even then you come like, no, we're not doing that.
[1:48:31.760 --> 1:48:43.760]  Because when I saw the whole time that I was on orders with the military, with National Guard, was that I saw people not even going into these facilities like you said.
[1:48:43.760 --> 1:48:56.760]  And even the COVID testing sites weren't even online. There wasn't any lines like that. We would be standing there for six, seven hours doing our rotations and maybe a couple of five or six people roll up, do the test and bounce out.
[1:48:56.760 --> 1:48:58.760]  And that was it. So you're absolutely right.
[1:48:58.760 --> 1:49:06.760]  I confirmed with my wife's personal trainer who trains these old ladies that they had snipples and coughs were all scared last week or not two weeks ago.
[1:49:06.760 --> 1:49:13.760]  And they went and they got the line. They said, we're too busy. Just give us your information.
[1:49:13.760 --> 1:49:20.760]  So they gave their information and they got emails back to they both had COVID weren't tested. See, but people say, oh, that's crazy.
[1:49:20.760 --> 1:49:26.760]  It's on record that Texas adopted what seven other Democrat states did only Texas as a Republican state did this.
[1:49:26.760 --> 1:49:32.760]  That's why our governor's betrayed us that if one person has COVID, they count 15 around them as having it.
[1:49:32.760 --> 1:49:43.760]  If you say you have the sniffles or a sore throat, you're counted as a COVID. So because they filled out in the form that they had sniffles and a cough, they have COVID brother.
[1:49:43.760 --> 1:49:52.760]  And it's crazy. And it's very criminal because we don't need to be the flu has killed more people than COVID has ever killed.
[1:49:52.760 --> 1:50:00.760]  The flu has been around for a generation. COVID has just been around for three months and it's killed more people than COVID will probably ever kill.
[1:50:00.760 --> 1:50:04.760]  Oh, absolutely. That's it, sir. Well, God bless you. And I appreciate your call.
[1:50:04.760 --> 1:50:09.760]  Said I get the five callers that's taken. I got the two because they're just great callers, but let's jam in one more before we go to break.
[1:50:09.760 --> 1:50:13.760]  Let's talk to Nelson in California. Go ahead. Thanks for holding.
[1:50:13.760 --> 1:50:17.760]  What's going on, Alex broadcasting worldwide, my friend. Hit us hard.
[1:50:17.760 --> 1:50:29.760]  It's time to speak with your brother. So the purpose of my call here is my girlfriend. She has a business in LA County and her neighbor, which is the owner of the business actually just got shut down and
[1:50:29.760 --> 1:50:35.760]  is required to get a clean bill of health. And my question to you is, have you heard about this clean bill of health?
[1:50:35.760 --> 1:50:40.760]  Yes, sir. Yes. You know what? Stay there. I'm going to come back and we'll cover this.
[1:50:40.760 --> 1:50:48.760]  But what's happening is the UN runs the standards. And then and then it goes through the NIH and through the National Health Boards.
[1:50:48.760 --> 1:50:53.760]  In England, in the United States, you know, in Australia, Spain and Australia have been the most draconian.
[1:50:53.760 --> 1:51:02.760]  Spain never came out of martial law after the dictator. They had Franco and quite frankly, Australia is a great country, but it was a prison colony.
[1:51:02.760 --> 1:51:11.760]  It's never been completely free. Okay. And so they're, they're, they're moving forward with force testing and then forced inoculation very soon.
[1:51:11.760 --> 1:51:19.760]  And they're the beta test for the rest of the planet. The UN has said we're going to come in your house and we're going to take your family and break you up until you've got a clean bill of health.
[1:51:19.760 --> 1:51:26.760]  And we're going to use your fake positive tests just to just keep you. And now they're saying, oh, guess what? The antibodies don't even mean you're healthy.
[1:51:26.760 --> 1:51:33.760]  Once we say you have it, you may just go to a prison. So this is just a way to arrest whoever they want. I'll explain when we come back.
[1:51:33.760 --> 1:51:41.760]  So I was taking care of an errand this morning and I wasn't even close to downtown, but I was parked on the side street going to this business.
[1:51:41.760 --> 1:51:50.760]  When I came back out, I saw what looked like two Asian folks, probably Chinese walking down the sidewalk about 50 yards up ahead of me.
[1:51:50.760 --> 1:51:58.760]  And here I am parked a truck with the windows up and the woman stops and points at me. So they stop and they wait while I'm inside my truck.
[1:51:58.760 --> 1:52:09.760]  Truck started and they sit there and stretch, keeps pointing and they put their hands out like they're waiting for me to go because I'm not wearing a mask inside my car.
[1:52:09.760 --> 1:52:19.760]  And so then I just sat there. So they acted angry and walked past me. I almost shot a video of it on my phone, but everybody sees this stuff happening everywhere.
[1:52:19.760 --> 1:52:26.760]  This is mental illness. People are pulling guns on folks that aren't wearing masks. This is all cult programming. This is all about submitting.
[1:52:26.760 --> 1:52:34.760]  We cannot submit to this UN brainwashing. It's all a giant fraud. We must expose the fraud or become slaves to it.
[1:52:34.760 --> 1:52:40.760]  Whether you believe in evolution in the modern theory or not, the globalist controllers do.
[1:52:40.760 --> 1:52:52.760]  They constantly write about and talk about how they want to create a global crisis or a group of crises that force humans to, quote, evolve in a new, better way.
[1:52:52.760 --> 1:52:55.760]  Now, when you study how they actually want you to evolve, you believe in that.
[1:52:55.760 --> 1:52:59.760]  It is to stop having children emerge with silicon bodies and a post-human future.
[1:52:59.760 --> 1:53:16.760]  Talk about psychotic. Talk about creepy. Talk about crazy. But they need an event like COVID-19 to teach a mammal to wear some covering over its nose, over its breathing tubes to set the precedent for the forced inoculations, for the GMO, for the 5G,
[1:53:16.760 --> 1:53:22.760]  and for all the things that they admit will end our humanity as we know it. That's why this is so evil.
[1:53:22.760 --> 1:53:31.760]  Their whole agenda for cashless society, global government, UN control, getting us all into debt, getting rid of local government.
[1:53:31.760 --> 1:53:55.760]  Think about all the facets of it, the censorship, the surveillance.
[1:53:55.760 --> 1:54:06.760]  That's what the United Nations Director of Emergency Operations has to say. His counterparts all across the United States are now saying, like in Texas, wear a mask in your house.
[1:54:06.760 --> 1:54:15.760]  They're going to be coming to your house soon off of Google and Apple spybots on your phone and demanding to test you and, well, take you and your family away.
[1:54:15.760 --> 1:54:26.760]  And at the moment, in most parts of the world, due to lockdown, most of the transmission that's actually happening in many countries now is happening in the household, at family level.
[1:54:26.760 --> 1:54:42.760]  In some senses, transmission has been taken off the streets and pushed back into family units. Now we need to go and look in families to find those people who may be sick and remove them and isolate them in a safe and dignified manner.
[1:54:42.760 --> 1:55:06.760]  You're locked down. You're not locked down. Wear a mask. You're 25% open. You're 75% open. You're 50% open. And now, California, New York, Michigan, Pennsylvania, and now sadly, shamefully, Texas, are test areas to set the precedent for the rest of the country in the world, just like countries like Spain and Australia have been.
[1:55:06.760 --> 1:55:19.760]  To where now, contact tracers, mainly AmeriCorps, Acorn types, under the Clinton Global Initiative, Chelsea Clinton runs it with Soros money. This is all in record. Bill Clinton's, I play clips and I'm talking about it.
[1:55:19.760 --> 1:55:30.760]  They all have databases now on your phone. And Apple and Google, four months ago, said that whether you have the app or not they're tracking you and it's been given to these groups, they will then, whatever algorithm they use over metric, they make it up.
[1:55:30.760 --> 1:55:38.760]  They go, oh, we got to come to your house and test you and make sure you're not sick because maybe you were in contact with somebody. It's all fraud.
[1:55:38.760 --> 1:55:50.760]  But they're also talking about making businesses go in and get tested all your employees before you can open. And then, of course, you go get tested and half your people are positive because it's all made up.
[1:55:50.760 --> 1:56:00.760]  Again, CDC says you've ever had a corona or flu virus on average in the last 10 years. You still will not just have the antibodies, but it's a test for the detritus.
[1:56:00.760 --> 1:56:10.760]  Well, a papaya, a goat, dirt has this. It's made up. This is all on record. And so this is the fraud. It's just bureaucrats able to come to your in your life.
[1:56:10.760 --> 1:56:22.760]  And then as they release more deadly forms of COVID in the future, this is a whole franchise. This is just the beta test. Then they're going to come for everybody. This is their excuse to come with hazmat suits and machine guns and kill you.
[1:56:22.760 --> 1:56:30.760]  And then the unit has said it. So this is the dystopia. We're in it. Tell me what's happening. I think you said your girlfriend. Tell us about it, Nelson.
[1:56:30.760 --> 1:56:44.760]  Yeah, no problem. Thanks for having my call again. So basically, heard the business neighbor of where they have a business in LA County, one employee tested positive for COVID.
[1:56:44.760 --> 1:56:57.760]  So at that point, the contact tracing went in and they started testing everybody. And some people are quarantined for like 22 days because they can't get a negative test and basically shut down that business until they get a clean bill of health, which I thought was pretty interesting.
[1:56:57.760 --> 1:57:06.760]  And then where I work at, I was actually sent home to work and they actually initiated apps to download so you could screen yourself before you go to work.
[1:57:06.760 --> 1:57:15.760]  And if you have any symptoms, it's not just going to be scanning somebody when you go in a bowling rink or something to see if you have temperature. It's going to be the apps control us.
[1:57:15.760 --> 1:57:25.760]  Look at this right here. Florida Labs reporting 100% positives this weekend. Can you believe the level of fraud? Sorry, go ahead.
[1:57:25.760 --> 1:57:37.760]  Yeah, no, it's perfect. And it's crazy that there's going on. And me, I'm trying to stay out of the radar as much as possible. I do not want to give my name. I don't want contact traces coming over here forcing me to take a test.
[1:57:37.760 --> 1:57:40.760]  And it's crazy what's going on, especially in California.
[1:57:40.760 --> 1:57:50.760]  They don't want any border with all the diseases coming across in crime. But you're going to have to, like you just said, the companies are going to make their employees test themselves with an app every day to go out.
[1:57:50.760 --> 1:57:54.760]  This is just the social credit score being forced on us. What is your girlfriend thing?
[1:57:54.760 --> 1:57:59.760]  Well, she's pretty worried, you know, because it hits super close to home.
[1:57:59.760 --> 1:58:10.760]  Well, people have to stop complying. It's terrorism by the governor and the mayors to create beta test contact tracers that have Nazi level power, martial law power, medical tyranny power.
[1:58:10.760 --> 1:58:17.760]  And to have you guys prime the pump and submit that you can't open your business until you go under this regimen of us.
[1:58:17.760 --> 1:58:23.760]  Notice I said everything that's happening to her before you even told me because it's happening. God bless you. Anything else, sir?
[1:58:23.760 --> 1:58:29.760]  No, that's it, man. You know, we got to keep up the fight, share the information. And, you know, we're all mad in Orange County.
[1:58:29.760 --> 1:58:33.760]  We have a lot of people, you know, not falling into this. So when the baloney scandal.
[1:58:33.760 --> 1:58:40.760]  Oh, that's good. I mean, we must not comply with any of this compliance is death. Go in the stores say you don't have the right to do this to me.
[1:58:40.760 --> 1:58:43.760]  It's do not put up with them.
[1:58:43.760 --> 1:58:54.760]  There are many reasons that the globalist launch this planetary lockdown. The number one reason is it serves every one of their purposes. We've gone over those purposes.
[1:58:54.760 --> 1:59:02.760]  Many times here on air, the casual society, the surveillance system, global government, medical tyranny, forced inoculation.
[1:59:02.760 --> 1:59:18.760]  The most important facet is it teaches us that we are obsolete, that we are non essential as we begin to witness automation computers and robots take over the jobs that people once had by design.
[1:59:18.760 --> 1:59:39.760]  This isn't like it's some advancement that we just fell into. It's been preplanned, organized globally. It's extremely predatory. And through governmental actuaries and tax programs and regulations, the central banks that control it all are able to pick the winners and the losers and consolidate power.
[1:59:39.760 --> 1:59:48.760]  This is the truest form of technocracy fascism.
[1:59:48.760 --> 1:59:53.760]  It's never going to get any better. Don't look for it. Be happy with what you got.
[1:59:53.760 --> 2:00:05.760]  Because the owners of this country don't want that. I'm talking about the real owners now, the real owners, the big wealthy business interest that control things and make all the important decisions.
[2:00:05.760 --> 2:00:17.760]  Forget the politicians. The politicians are put there to give you the idea that you have freedom of choice. You don't. You have no choice. You have owners. They own you.
[2:00:17.760 --> 2:00:26.760]  They own everything. They own all the important land. They own and control the corporations. They've long since bought and paid for the senate, the congress, the state houses and city halls.
[2:00:26.760 --> 2:00:36.760]  They've got the judges in their back pockets and they own all the big media companies so they control just about all of the news and information you get to hear. They got you by the balls.
[2:00:36.760 --> 2:00:53.760]  They want obedient workers, obedient workers, people who are just smart enough to run the machines and do the paperwork and just dumb enough to passively accept jobs with a lower pay, the longer hours to reduce benefits, the end of overtime and the vanishing pension that disappears the minute you go to collect it.
[2:00:53.760 --> 2:01:04.760]  And now they're coming for your social security money so they can give it to their criminal friends on Wall Street. It's a big club and you ain't in it.
[2:01:04.760 --> 2:01:13.760]  And you said recently, quote, when you give, they do whatever the hell you want them to do. You better believe it. So what specifically did they do?
[2:01:13.760 --> 2:01:19.760]  If I ask them, if I need them, you know, most of the people on this stage I've given to just so you understand. A lot of money.
[2:01:19.760 --> 2:01:29.760]  You and I are not in the big club. The owners of this country know the truth. It's called the American dream because you have to be asleep to believe it.
[2:01:29.760 --> 2:01:44.760]  But I'll tell you what they don't want. They don't want a population of citizens capable of critical thinking. They don't want well-informed, well-educated people capable of critical thinking. They're not interested in that. That doesn't help them. That's against their interest. That's right.
[2:01:44.760 --> 2:01:51.760]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[2:02:14.760 --> 2:02:24.760]  That's right. The Washington Post is now calling for the Texas Rangers to get rid of their name.
[2:02:24.760 --> 2:02:36.760]  How about the Texas Cucks? I bet the governor will probably support that. The Texas Cucks team must go. The Texas Rangers team must go.
[2:02:36.760 --> 2:02:46.760]  This is by Karen Atta, and she goes on to say, Texas is evil. America is evil. The Texas Rangers are evil. They're just bad people.
[2:02:46.760 --> 2:02:55.760]  And so the name is bad. Doesn't matter. There's modern Texas Rangers. You've got to get rid of everything, including the American flag. This is really all about hate your country.
[2:02:55.760 --> 2:02:58.760]  That story is now up on infowars.com.
[2:02:58.760 --> 2:03:10.760]  Now, here's another big story before we go back to your calls. It needs to go viral. You know that dirt's been sent off papayas, goats, cows.
[2:03:10.760 --> 2:03:19.760]  Negative tests that are actually done by real labs are sent off to U.N. labs, Bill and Melinda Gates labs that got shut down by the FDA, and they all come back 100% positive.
[2:03:19.760 --> 2:03:32.760]  They've also had cases where they test meat packing plants and everybody comes back positive. In others, they'll test thousands and a couple hundred, three hundred, four hundred will come back positive, and all of them are asymptomatic because it's false positive.
[2:03:32.760 --> 2:03:35.760]  But now look at this news out.
[2:03:35.760 --> 2:03:55.760]  333 Florida testing labs reported 100% positive test today in the state report for 3,528 tests. This is a 34% of today's 10,360 new cases. And that's just the ones they looked at reported 100%. They're not even hiding it.
[2:03:55.760 --> 2:04:06.760]  I bet you money, money, Lobowski, that they're not even doing the test because the test costs money.
[2:04:06.760 --> 2:04:17.760]  I mean, hell, if you can take a person that's got the flu and stick them in a nursing home to kill a bunch of people and call it COVID, you're not going to get in trouble if you're a lab and put out false positives.
[2:04:17.760 --> 2:04:24.760]  Why do the test? It's going to be a false positive almost every time. Anyways, just say you did it.
[2:04:24.760 --> 2:04:33.760]  Just like the two older women that my wife's personal trainer and I got on the phone with them. I didn't just get it second hand. I got on the phone with the trainer.
[2:04:33.760 --> 2:04:39.760]  I got the number. I called the old lady up.
[2:04:39.760 --> 2:04:48.760]  And then she got real scared when I said, I'm going to record this for my show. No, you're not. Click. Call back.
[2:04:48.760 --> 2:04:55.760]  And they go up there, never get in. They're going to give us your name, your info. And then they got emails. You have COVID, you have COVID, you have COVID.
[2:04:55.760 --> 2:05:05.760]  Fraud, a total fraud because it's a war. We're facing a war. We're facing a total takeover. Of course they're going to lie.
[2:05:05.760 --> 2:05:09.760]  Look at this.
[2:05:09.760 --> 2:05:20.760]  LAB24 inclab, 444 tests in a day. Taxpayer paid for. Percent, 100%. It just goes right down the line.
[2:05:20.760 --> 2:05:37.760]  Zoom in a little bit if you can. Yeah, perfect. So wonder why we heard Cuomo and Clinton and all and Obama and all the elected, formerly elected going, we need ventilators and we need testing.
[2:05:37.760 --> 2:05:52.760]  Ventilators, testing, testing, ventilators, ventilators, ventilators, send in the people with pneumonia to the nursing homes.
[2:05:52.760 --> 2:06:05.760]  All of it to get the death numbers up. All of it to put them down the tube and kill them. All of it to jack up the numbers as much as they can. This is insane.
[2:06:05.760 --> 2:06:10.760]  Wow.
[2:06:10.760 --> 2:06:16.760]  And there's the reason you haven't heard Roger Stone on this show yet. He may end up getting on today, tomorrow. He may do handy tonight.
[2:06:16.760 --> 2:06:20.760]  Roger Stone, judge, orders DOJ to submit.
[2:06:20.760 --> 2:06:26.760]  Trump's computation ordered. Commutation ordered.
[2:06:26.760 --> 2:06:34.760]  And so he's still under her jurisdiction and there's little noises out there. She might gag him again. Why not be a total tyrant?
[2:06:34.760 --> 2:06:40.760]  So he can't fight while they attack him going forward on his appeal. All right, let's go to your phone calls.
[2:06:40.760 --> 2:06:50.760]  There's been all the longest here. That would be Steven Chicago. You're on the air, sir. Go ahead. Hey Alex, how you doing, bud?
[2:06:50.760 --> 2:06:58.760]  Man, I'm all right. This is just, I mean, they're nakedly lying to us out in the open. Florida, all the tests come up positive. I checked. This is confirmed numbers.
[2:06:58.760 --> 2:07:08.760]  Oh, I know. It's been going on for decades, centuries even. It's just crazy. I mean, and you know what? You can literally look back at history at the same things that I'm going to say the word.
[2:07:08.760 --> 2:07:15.760]  Everyone hates hearing it though. Nazi. It's the same thing. It's just, it's modern time and it's spread throughout the world. It's not just in Europe.
[2:07:15.760 --> 2:07:22.760]  Like, look at Australia. They got people locked up in apartments. That sounds like a ghetto. They got people busting all the store windows around all the cities.
[2:07:22.760 --> 2:07:33.760]  That sounds like Kristallnacht. The Antifa symbols match Nazi. I forget what exactly it was, but you had it up. It's like, if it's a duck, if it quacks like a duck, it's probably a duck.
[2:07:33.760 --> 2:07:45.760]  And you know what? This all went back to Operation Paperclip. We brought these guys into power. We put them in positions and now they've brought in their whole family members, their relatives, everybody, and they've been running the show as...
[2:07:45.760 --> 2:07:52.760]  Well, I'll say this. The spirit of eugenics and globalism and empire was in the Nazis and it's in our leadership.
[2:07:52.760 --> 2:08:03.760]  And they'd gotten away with it and they put so many criminals in the strata and the public has been so naive that, yeah, now we're in deep, deep, deep trouble.
[2:08:03.760 --> 2:08:10.760]  I mean, COVID is one giant fraud from beginning to end and I wish there wasn't anything real deadly associated with it.
[2:08:10.760 --> 2:08:21.760]  I mean, children, it is weaponized. It is a chimera, so you have an autoimmune response to it, so it freaks your body out because it's got so many different viruses in it that your body's experienced before.
[2:08:21.760 --> 2:08:28.760]  But it's new, so they own it and so they can roll out new versions of it and so Gates and the UN can make money.
[2:08:28.760 --> 2:08:39.760]  And then Fauci publicly is one of the co-owners of the major Wuhan lab studies with the virus itself publicly.
[2:08:39.760 --> 2:08:45.760]  I mean, he's an absolute mastermind James Bond villain in front of us.
[2:08:45.760 --> 2:08:52.760]  He's been there over 40 years at NIH and he thinks he is our God because he is a psychotic eugenics monster.
[2:08:52.760 --> 2:08:54.760]  He is Hitler 2.0.
[2:08:54.760 --> 2:08:59.760]  And they're just doing the confusion conquer, confusion conquer, confusion conquer with everything.
[2:08:59.760 --> 2:09:08.760]  That's why you never get a clear answer in all the news that we have to watch on this free television programming that programs us what to do and what to think.
[2:09:08.760 --> 2:09:11.760]  They're all going to tell you all the things that you're not saying.
[2:09:11.760 --> 2:09:15.760]  And Alex, I got to hand it to you, man. You are a titan.
[2:09:15.760 --> 2:09:19.760]  You just take mud on your face all the time and you keep going.
[2:09:19.760 --> 2:09:23.760]  I'm not just trying to blow smoke up you here. You don't get the credit you should get.
[2:09:23.760 --> 2:09:26.760]  You only get the criticism because of the emotions you show.
[2:09:26.760 --> 2:09:29.760]  I understand, brother. I just did the best I can. I appreciate you.
[2:09:29.760 --> 2:09:33.760]  I'm deep into this. I can't back down now and it's all real, so I just do it the way I can.
[2:09:33.760 --> 2:09:38.760]  I know I could be a lot slicker and polished and might have done a better job and I just I'm swinging for the fences, brother.
[2:09:38.760 --> 2:10:07.760]  We'll be right back with more calls.
[2:10:08.760 --> 2:10:10.760]  We'll be right back with more calls.

[2:11:36.760 --> 2:11:42.760]  Other systems just don't compare.
[2:11:42.760 --> 2:11:56.760]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[2:11:56.760 --> 2:12:03.760]  Monday through Friday from 11 a.m. to 3 p.m. I'm here live. I'm Alex Jones, your host, the most censored talk show host in the world.
[2:12:03.760 --> 2:12:07.760]  Because we're on target. We're over the target. We know what we're talking about.
[2:12:07.760 --> 2:12:12.760]  Some good old Tom Petty right here.
[2:12:12.760 --> 2:12:18.760]  I'm going to take your phone calls for two more segments than I've got.
[2:12:18.760 --> 2:12:23.760]  Special report I want to get into about where COVID-19 is really going in my research for you.
[2:12:23.760 --> 2:12:29.760]  But I've really studied this and I've learned the nuances and I don't just say I know what they're going to do next.
[2:12:29.760 --> 2:12:37.760]  By accident. If I really just think about how evil they are and how bad they are and what they've done before and just think of the most horrible thing.
[2:12:37.760 --> 2:12:39.760]  That's what they do. It's always exactly.
[2:12:39.760 --> 2:12:48.760]  But a good general gets in the enemy's mind. But I remember when Pelosi came out in February and said, oh, go to Chinatown.
[2:12:48.760 --> 2:12:51.760]  Hug people. They were doing the same thing. You know, hug Chinese.
[2:12:51.760 --> 2:12:56.760]  And that was to trick Trump to say COVID is not a problem.
[2:12:56.760 --> 2:13:01.760]  Now, I saw that and went, oh, he better say it's a problem. It's a setup.
[2:13:01.760 --> 2:13:04.760]  But it was more sophisticated.
[2:13:04.760 --> 2:13:06.760]  They were going to exaggerate it at every death.
[2:13:06.760 --> 2:13:10.760]  And when they wanted to have the media turn the switch on and say that Trump had downplayed it.
[2:13:10.760 --> 2:13:24.760]  But it wouldn't matter if they were being two faced or hypocritical or oxymoronical because the media overall wouldn't cover it and would only put pressure on Trump.
[2:13:24.760 --> 2:13:28.760]  And so that's exactly what they were doing. That's why Fauci brought in the COVID-19 people.
[2:13:28.760 --> 2:13:40.760]  That's why he dropped them off without testing because they wanted to have the cases and have the positive test and have the false positive test because it all mixes together.
[2:13:40.760 --> 2:13:45.760]  And now Pelosi's come out and said her and Democrats have no regrets about downplaying COVID.
[2:13:45.760 --> 2:13:52.760]  And then Trump finally called on what they were doing with my advice and other people's advice and played it up.
[2:13:52.760 --> 2:13:54.760]  But then that's a trap too.
[2:13:54.760 --> 2:13:57.760]  But we weren't sure then exactly what was happening.
[2:13:57.760 --> 2:13:59.760]  But early on we figured it out.
[2:13:59.760 --> 2:14:01.760]  So what are they going to do next?
[2:14:01.760 --> 2:14:02.760]  I'll tell you in the last segment.
[2:14:02.760 --> 2:14:04.760]  But before Gerald Salante taking over.
[2:14:04.760 --> 2:14:07.760]  But right now, let's go back to your amazing calls.
[2:14:07.760 --> 2:14:09.760]  He's all been amazing calls. They're always good calls.
[2:14:09.760 --> 2:14:11.760]  He's been amazing calls today.
[2:14:11.760 --> 2:14:14.760]  Who's been holding the longest now?
[2:14:14.760 --> 2:14:17.760]  That would be Jim and Ohio. Sir, go ahead.
[2:14:17.760 --> 2:14:19.760]  Hello.
[2:14:19.760 --> 2:14:20.760]  Welcome.
[2:14:20.760 --> 2:14:23.760]  Hey, the thing I was concerned about.
[2:14:23.760 --> 2:14:26.760]  I'm starting to hear a lot of people say it is voter fraud.
[2:14:26.760 --> 2:14:34.760]  It seems that it's kind of like it's at the conspiracy theory level now.
[2:14:34.760 --> 2:14:38.760]  And it's obvious that they're setting this up.
[2:14:38.760 --> 2:14:47.760]  My mother, who was a lifelong Democrat yesterday, talked to me about, well, I guess we're going to have to mail in our ballots.
[2:14:47.760 --> 2:14:51.760]  And I said, why do you say that? She goes, well, that's what they're saying we're going to have to do.
[2:14:51.760 --> 2:14:57.760]  And I said, well, you know, that's probably going to be a bait and switch.
[2:14:57.760 --> 2:14:59.760]  They're going to, you know, whoever.
[2:14:59.760 --> 2:15:03.760]  Of course, they're telling old people you got to do it over email or you got to do it by written in ballot.
[2:15:03.760 --> 2:15:04.760]  And then they can turn up.
[2:15:04.760 --> 2:15:10.760]  Look, listen, cats, sir, cats are getting ballots in the mail.
[2:15:10.760 --> 2:15:12.760]  Cats are getting voter registration.
[2:15:12.760 --> 2:15:17.760]  They're just scraping all names they know of legal, illegal, dead, you name it.
[2:15:17.760 --> 2:15:20.760]  And they're sending them out to key addresses of Democrats.
[2:15:20.760 --> 2:15:32.760]  I know people that are Democrats who've now woken up who are the ones getting voter registration cards in other people's names and voter information in in dead people's names.
[2:15:32.760 --> 2:15:33.760]  Wink, wink.
[2:15:33.760 --> 2:15:34.760]  They're supposed to be part of the program.
[2:15:34.760 --> 2:15:35.760]  Here's that clip.
[2:15:35.760 --> 2:15:36.760]  I'll come back to you.
[2:15:36.760 --> 2:15:38.760]  We're often being reminded to vote.
[2:15:38.760 --> 2:15:42.760]  Some people are even getting fliers in the mail to register.
[2:15:42.760 --> 2:15:50.760]  But Ron and Carol Timbs say there's no way their cat is going to the polls.
[2:15:50.760 --> 2:15:56.760]  When Ron Timbs checked his mail Wednesday, he found something for Cody Timbs.
[2:15:56.760 --> 2:15:58.760]  Cody doesn't get much mail.
[2:15:58.760 --> 2:16:00.760]  Cody is a cat.
[2:16:00.760 --> 2:16:02.760]  He died 12 years ago.
[2:16:02.760 --> 2:16:05.760]  The family keeps his ashes in this green container.
[2:16:05.760 --> 2:16:12.760]  A great cat, indoor, outdoor, loved his family, loved the neighborhood.
[2:16:12.760 --> 2:16:14.760]  He was 18 and a half when he passed away.
[2:16:14.760 --> 2:16:19.760]  So the Timbs were surprised and a bit amused when they saw what came in the mail.
[2:16:19.760 --> 2:16:23.760]  We have a voter registration application for Cody Timbs.
[2:16:23.760 --> 2:16:25.760]  It even came with a return envelope.
[2:16:25.760 --> 2:16:26.760]  How'd this happen?
[2:16:26.760 --> 2:16:29.760]  I mean, it's not reality.
[2:16:29.760 --> 2:16:30.760]  He's a cat.
[2:16:30.760 --> 2:16:31.760]  Here he is.
[2:16:31.760 --> 2:16:33.760]  And he's been dead for a long time.
[2:16:33.760 --> 2:16:38.760]  Carol Timbs understands that in this election year, there's a huge push to get people to the polls.
[2:16:38.760 --> 2:16:40.760]  There's a huge push.
[2:16:40.760 --> 2:16:47.760]  But if they're trying to register cats, I'm not quite sure who else they're trying to register.
[2:16:47.760 --> 2:16:52.760]  I don't know if they're registering dogs.
[2:16:52.760 --> 2:16:54.760]  Well, of course they are.
[2:16:54.760 --> 2:16:57.760]  They're scraping names, sending it out, wink, wink.
[2:16:57.760 --> 2:16:59.760]  The Democrats are everywhere saying let's engage in fraud.
[2:16:59.760 --> 2:17:05.760]  So when they're sending out millions of mail-in ballots, the courts are having to strike them down.
[2:17:05.760 --> 2:17:06.760]  Some states aren't.
[2:17:06.760 --> 2:17:08.760]  They're going to try to steal the election.
[2:17:08.760 --> 2:17:15.760]  And when Trump challenges that, they're saying in the council on farm relations that the military is going to be used under rogue command by them.
[2:17:15.760 --> 2:17:18.760]  And that any military that doesn't go along will be put in prison.
[2:17:18.760 --> 2:17:21.760]  So they're openly saying, you challenge us, you're going to prison.
[2:17:21.760 --> 2:17:22.760]  What do you think of that?
[2:17:22.760 --> 2:17:29.760]  Well, it brings up my second point is that us, the silent majority, needs to quit being so silent.
[2:17:29.760 --> 2:17:36.760]  Because if they're going to play this game on us, we need to get ourselves armed, get ourselves trained and prepared.
[2:17:36.760 --> 2:17:41.760]  Because there might be a day where we just can't sit on the sofa anymore and complain.
[2:17:41.760 --> 2:17:44.760]  Well, Jim, I don't think, and I hear what you're saying.
[2:17:44.760 --> 2:17:47.760]  Because they're coming to your house, the force will be to inoculate you there.
[2:17:47.760 --> 2:17:48.760]  I mean, it's on.
[2:17:48.760 --> 2:17:55.760]  We've got to get aggressive now with bull horns with putting up signs at night with calling in a talk radio like you're doing and getting others active.
[2:17:55.760 --> 2:17:57.760]  Now is the time to get others registered.
[2:17:57.760 --> 2:18:00.760]  Now is the time to expose the fraud and do what you're doing right now.
[2:18:00.760 --> 2:18:01.760]  Thank you so much.
[2:18:01.760 --> 2:18:02.760]  And God bless.
[2:18:02.760 --> 2:18:09.760]  Okay, let's go ahead and take a call from Nevin in Michigan.
[2:18:09.760 --> 2:18:11.760]  Nevin, thanks for holding your on the year.
[2:18:11.760 --> 2:18:12.760]  Hi, Alex.
[2:18:12.760 --> 2:18:13.760]  Thanks for taking my call.
[2:18:13.760 --> 2:18:14.760]  Thank you, sir.
[2:18:14.760 --> 2:18:21.760]  So I guess just first thing I want to plug real quick, I have to say I've been following you for about one year now.
[2:18:21.760 --> 2:18:24.760]  And I started buying the X2.
[2:18:24.760 --> 2:18:33.760]  The best way I can describe it is it lifted a veil on my overall perspective on life.
[2:18:33.760 --> 2:18:40.760]  And it sounds crazy, but I almost was going through life with a cloud hanging over me.
[2:18:40.760 --> 2:18:43.760]  And that X2 just cleared it.
[2:18:43.760 --> 2:18:49.760]  I mean, it took probably six months to fully feel the full effects from it.
[2:18:49.760 --> 2:18:51.760]  But that right there was an amazing thing.
[2:18:51.760 --> 2:18:54.760]  And now I'm on a DNA force.
[2:18:54.760 --> 2:18:57.760]  So that's what I want you to tell us about that.
[2:18:57.760 --> 2:18:58.760]  And I'll hold you over for your point.
[2:18:58.760 --> 2:19:03.760]  But but since you raised this, thanks for calling because I know what X2 does and X3.
[2:19:03.760 --> 2:19:05.760]  Well, I don't forget to take it.
[2:19:05.760 --> 2:19:09.760]  And I get so busy that it's probably been two weeks since I took it.
[2:19:09.760 --> 2:19:14.760]  I'll get good and I'll take it almost every day and all of a sudden I have energy and libido and want to work out more.
[2:19:14.760 --> 2:19:16.760]  And my wife's like, wow, you're like Superman.
[2:19:16.760 --> 2:19:17.760]  You're losing all this weight.
[2:19:17.760 --> 2:19:19.760]  And then I forget for two weeks to take it.
[2:19:19.760 --> 2:19:22.760]  And I just took on a triple dose, which people shouldn't do.
[2:19:22.760 --> 2:19:26.760]  But since I've forgotten because it's like, wow, God gave us this true atomic.
[2:19:26.760 --> 2:19:28.760]  I and I would get a DEA license to get it.
[2:19:28.760 --> 2:19:30.760]  Nobody else has this folks.
[2:19:30.760 --> 2:19:31.760]  This is the real stuff.
[2:19:31.760 --> 2:19:36.760]  And it on average about two, three weeks when you start taking it, you're going to have a detox.
[2:19:36.760 --> 2:19:39.760]  You're going to feel like total crap for a week or so.
[2:19:39.760 --> 2:19:42.760]  This is what I was told when we first did this by Dr. Group.
[2:19:42.760 --> 2:19:46.760]  And then after that, it felt like I was like walking up the stairs with what you like.
[2:19:46.760 --> 2:19:51.760]  There's a thing called Mount Benel and it's a couple hundred stairs or more up to this hilltop.
[2:19:51.760 --> 2:19:55.760]  And I used to carry my kids up there when you go up those stairs and take them off your shoulders.
[2:19:55.760 --> 2:19:57.760]  You feel like you're flying because the weight's off.
[2:19:57.760 --> 2:20:01.760]  And it was suddenly after about a month of being on it, I felt, you know, so much better.
[2:20:01.760 --> 2:20:03.760]  I didn't get the sunspots I used to.
[2:20:03.760 --> 2:20:05.760]  I was had more libido.
[2:20:05.760 --> 2:20:09.760]  And I'm just going to leave it at that and absolutely true what you're saying.
[2:20:09.760 --> 2:20:11.760]  But with you, it took six months.
[2:20:11.760 --> 2:20:16.760]  That means your pineal gland must have really been calcified with fluoride.
[2:20:16.760 --> 2:20:19.760]  With a lot of people, it only takes a month or so to get a lot of that out of there.
[2:20:19.760 --> 2:20:21.760]  But this is heavy stuff.
[2:20:21.760 --> 2:20:26.760]  The bad halogen is the fluoride, the chlorine, the bromide, the bromine that they dump into everything.
[2:20:26.760 --> 2:20:30.760]  The good halogen is the iodine and it's not just good for all your glands.
[2:20:30.760 --> 2:20:31.760]  It's not just essential.
[2:20:31.760 --> 2:20:36.760]  It deals with consciousness and the lens in my personal view through which your soul stares.
[2:20:36.760 --> 2:21:04.760]  We're right back with the color.
[2:21:07.760 --> 2:21:12.760]  It's time to take a new healthier approach to one of your most basic needs.
[2:21:12.760 --> 2:21:19.760]  The Electropure Pro water filtration system is the same water filter that Alex and the ImpalWars crew use every day for the purest water possible.
[2:21:19.760 --> 2:21:23.760]  You can start cleaning the toxins from your water for clean, healthy and delicious drinking water.
[2:21:23.760 --> 2:21:26.760]  Perfect for preppers or anyone concerned with the healthier source of water,
[2:21:26.760 --> 2:21:30.760]  the Electropure Pro can remove up to 99.9% of impurities.
[2:21:30.760 --> 2:21:34.760]  This groundbreaking, gravity-fed water filtration system is like no other.
[2:21:34.760 --> 2:21:38.760]  Make sure your water is up to your standards today with the Electropure Pro.
[2:21:38.760 --> 2:21:41.760]  I know what we'll do to make them conform to our cult.
[2:21:41.760 --> 2:21:44.760]  We'll all tell them to wear masks or they're gonna die.
[2:21:44.760 --> 2:21:48.760]  And then we'll release the pressure for a while and then bring it back and squeeze it harder and release it again.
[2:21:48.760 --> 2:21:50.760]  And we'll be the virtuous second ones.
[2:21:50.760 --> 2:21:56.760]  We'll be the angels even though our Lord and Master Bill Gates helped fund the whole COVID-19.
[2:21:56.760 --> 2:22:00.760]  No, don't seduce me.
[2:22:00.760 --> 2:22:04.760]  That's right, that's the code word for Bill Gates's operation.
[2:22:04.760 --> 2:22:10.760]  He carries out with his good little buddy Dr. Fauci in the surgeon cult.
[2:22:10.760 --> 2:22:16.760]  As you know, for girls, there's five different types of villains they secretly desire in the romance novels.
[2:22:16.760 --> 2:22:22.760]  One of them's the vampire, the werewolf, the billionaire, and who else?
[2:22:22.760 --> 2:22:25.760]  Oh, that's right, there's the surgeon and then there's one other one.
[2:22:25.760 --> 2:22:31.760]  And it's so much fun to be ruled over by these psychotic psychopaths and it's so good to know that there are masters
[2:22:31.760 --> 2:22:35.760]  that are coming to rape us with their inoculations.
[2:22:35.760 --> 2:22:37.760]  Psychopaths are so hot.
[2:22:37.760 --> 2:22:39.760]  Oh, yeah.
[2:22:39.760 --> 2:22:44.760]  Imagine telling someone just a year ago that in the middle of 2020,
[2:22:44.760 --> 2:22:50.760]  the Democrats as well as many Republican leaders would be calling for the United Nations WHO edict
[2:22:50.760 --> 2:22:57.760]  that all Americans wear masks be a, quote, federal order and mandate.
[2:22:57.760 --> 2:23:01.760]  Totally unconstitutional, annihilating states' rights.
[2:23:01.760 --> 2:23:04.760]  Think about that. A woman can kill her baby.
[2:23:04.760 --> 2:23:07.760]  You pay for illegal aliens' health care.
[2:23:07.760 --> 2:23:13.760]  But you've got to wear a mask for a virus that killed 20 plus times less than what they said,
[2:23:13.760 --> 2:23:15.760]  even if you believe the official story.
[2:23:15.760 --> 2:23:20.760]  This is about the WHO, the globalist testing their power through the media,
[2:23:20.760 --> 2:23:24.760]  over the federal government to set policy in the United States.
[2:23:24.760 --> 2:23:29.760]  This is our punishment for not going with the carbon taxes and the Paris Accord and all of it.
[2:23:29.760 --> 2:23:31.760]  And by the way, they admit that.
[2:23:31.760 --> 2:23:46.760]  They say now your carbon's down one way or another, you stupid Americans.
[2:24:01.760 --> 2:24:03.760]  We're going back to your phone calls in a moment.
[2:24:03.760 --> 2:24:06.760]  I've got the latest COVID-19 information as well.
[2:24:06.760 --> 2:24:08.760]  Joe Salante's coming up as well.
[2:24:08.760 --> 2:24:14.760]  But here's a really important report on the Giselaen Maxwell situation panicking the corrupt alpha maggots.
[2:24:14.760 --> 2:24:21.760]  Giselaen Maxwell, the socialite who was more of a social disease to the powerful pedophiles she introduced
[2:24:21.760 --> 2:24:27.760]  to Jeffrey Epstein's surveillance blackmail, Shakedown, now awaits an arraignment and bail hearing
[2:24:27.760 --> 2:24:32.760]  in a Brooklyn, New York Metropolitan Detention Center that has been described as a third world hellhole.
[2:24:32.760 --> 2:24:39.760]  Cameron Lindsay, a former warden said it is one of the most troubled facilities in the federal prison system
[2:24:39.760 --> 2:24:42.760]  and had a unique history of staff misconduct.
[2:24:42.760 --> 2:24:50.760]  I was the warden at the Metropolitan Detention Center from the spring of 2007 to the late fall of 2009.
[2:24:50.760 --> 2:24:53.760]  So I was there for a little over two and a half years as warden.
[2:24:53.760 --> 2:25:00.760]  So I'm very familiar with the facility. What I would have expected her to experience when she entered the facility
[2:25:00.760 --> 2:25:05.760]  was, first of all, she would have come in full restraints, which would have included leg irons,
[2:25:05.760 --> 2:25:13.760]  a belly chain to attach handcuffs, and the handcuffs will be attached to the belly chain to immobilize her hands.
[2:25:13.760 --> 2:25:25.760]  Maxwell, who is supposedly monitored 24-7, was essentially given a paper bag to wear while her bedding was stripped to prevent any possibility of a suicide attempt.
[2:25:25.760 --> 2:25:32.760]  Ghislaine Maxwell's indictment specifically focuses on the years 1994 to 1997,
[2:25:32.760 --> 2:25:38.760]  as those when she facilitated and contributed to Jeffrey Epstein's abuse of minor girls
[2:25:38.760 --> 2:25:44.760]  by, among other things, helping Epstein to recruit groom and ultimately abuse victims
[2:25:44.760 --> 2:25:47.760]  known to Maxwell and Epstein to be under the age of 18.
[2:25:47.760 --> 2:25:50.760]  Why did you keep going back if you didn't want to go back?
[2:25:54.760 --> 2:26:03.760]  In 2005, an investigation started into Epstein for the sexual abuse of more than 40 young girls in Florida.
[2:26:03.760 --> 2:26:09.760]  I don't know what to do. I was afraid that he was going to harm my family.
[2:26:09.760 --> 2:26:15.760]  A culture of see-no-evil elites allowed Maxwell to continue to move amongst high places,
[2:26:15.760 --> 2:26:21.760]  as Breitbart reported Ellen Powell, who gained infamy overseeing Reddit's lurch toward censorship,
[2:26:21.760 --> 2:26:24.760]  during her brief tenure as CEO of the site.
[2:26:24.760 --> 2:26:30.760]  In 2015, claims she knew Ghislaine Maxwell and Jeffrey Epstein supplied underage girls
[2:26:30.760 --> 2:26:34.760]  as sex toys for the rich and powerful and said nothing.
[2:26:34.760 --> 2:26:41.760]  And as The Sun reported, according to a reformed jewel thief who goes by the pseudonym William Steele,
[2:26:41.760 --> 2:26:47.760]  claims Epstein and Maxwell made him watch recorded videos to prove how they owned people.
[2:26:47.760 --> 2:26:52.760]  The footage included two high-profile U.S. politicians having sex with minors
[2:26:52.760 --> 2:26:57.760]  and two high-society figures having a threesome with an underage girl.
[2:26:57.760 --> 2:27:04.760]  Steele also branded Maxwell a wild nymphomaniac who would try everything and anything in bed.
[2:27:04.760 --> 2:27:10.760]  Steele said, when you're in a situation like that, you have to pretend to be non-judgmental,
[2:27:10.760 --> 2:27:15.760]  but it was shocking. I saw videos of very powerful people, celebrities, world figures,
[2:27:15.760 --> 2:27:20.760]  in those videos having sex, threesome, even orgies with minors.
[2:27:20.760 --> 2:27:26.760]  And those that had breathed a sigh of relief after Jeffrey Epstein didn't kill himself
[2:27:26.760 --> 2:27:30.760]  in the federal facility in Manhattan are once again panicking,
[2:27:30.760 --> 2:27:36.760]  especially Prince Andrew, who according to Christina Ochsenberg, who is Prince Andrew's second cousin,
[2:27:36.760 --> 2:27:42.760]  claims that she was told by Maxwell that secret tapes exist of Prince Andrew's escapades
[2:27:42.760 --> 2:27:46.760]  that he has clumsily denied. But the evidence is stacking up,
[2:27:46.760 --> 2:27:51.760]  and Maxwell may have enough evidence on Prince Andrew and others to lighten her sentence.
[2:27:51.760 --> 2:27:56.760]  In the subculture of jails and prisons, it would be a badge of honor for somebody to...
[2:27:56.760 --> 2:27:59.760]  another roommate to kill somebody like Miss Maxwell.
[2:27:59.760 --> 2:28:05.760]  Currently, the morbid Vegas odds on the future of Glaine Maxwell are three to one.
[2:28:05.760 --> 2:28:10.760]  Right now, that Maxwell will either have an accident or commit suicide.
[2:28:10.760 --> 2:28:12.760]  John Bowen reporting.
[2:28:15.760 --> 2:28:17.760]  That's an important report. I want to get to it.
[2:28:17.760 --> 2:28:23.760]  It's in the John Bowen section at band.video.Gisling Maxwell panics elites.
[2:28:23.760 --> 2:28:26.760]  And boy, do they hope you don't share it in other videos at band.video.
[2:28:26.760 --> 2:28:31.760]  But you are, and when you share it, folks, tell them this is forbidden information.
[2:28:31.760 --> 2:28:35.760]  Share it if you want to bring down these corrupt elites and save these children.
[2:28:35.760 --> 2:28:37.760]  Band.video, folks, you're kicking butt.
[2:28:37.760 --> 2:28:40.760]  Nevin, now you started plugging some products and went off into a rant about that.
[2:28:40.760 --> 2:28:43.760]  What was your point about rebuilding the Republic?
[2:28:43.760 --> 2:28:48.760]  Okay, so I've been doing just a lot of thinking about what, you know,
[2:28:48.760 --> 2:28:51.760]  what each individual person can do.
[2:28:51.760 --> 2:28:53.760]  And, you know, you can go on Facebook and complain.
[2:28:53.760 --> 2:28:55.760]  You can, you know, try to get the word out.
[2:28:55.760 --> 2:28:58.760]  You know, some people are getting banned to try to speak the truth.
[2:28:58.760 --> 2:29:03.760]  And I just feel like we're on a carousel that is never ending.
[2:29:03.760 --> 2:29:07.760]  And you just go around on the carousel and it's like the definition of insanity.
[2:29:07.760 --> 2:29:09.760]  It just keeps going on.
[2:29:09.760 --> 2:29:12.760]  Well, I agree, but here's the good news and the bad news.
[2:29:12.760 --> 2:29:14.760]  It's accelerating into total tyranny now.
[2:29:14.760 --> 2:29:17.760]  So the wheat from the chaff is going to get separated.
[2:29:17.760 --> 2:29:19.760]  This equilibrium is over.
[2:29:19.760 --> 2:29:21.760]  Things are going to get a lot worse a lot quicker, I believe,
[2:29:21.760 --> 2:29:23.760]  but that's going to wake up humanity.
[2:29:23.760 --> 2:29:24.760]  What do you think?
[2:29:24.760 --> 2:29:25.760]  Yes.
[2:29:25.760 --> 2:29:26.760]  So I agree.
[2:29:26.760 --> 2:29:29.760]  So I was actually reading the Drudge here and left this Drudge.
[2:29:29.760 --> 2:29:36.760]  I'd say they had a report about sorrows doing the 220 million.
[2:29:36.760 --> 2:29:39.760]  And in this hill right up, it says,
[2:29:39.760 --> 2:29:42.760]  the investment includes efforts to support local governments
[2:29:42.760 --> 2:29:46.760]  and organizations seeking to strengthen local expertise
[2:29:46.760 --> 2:29:49.760]  in understanding and navigating municipal budgets
[2:29:49.760 --> 2:29:52.760]  as cities reimagine public safety
[2:29:52.760 --> 2:29:56.760]  and move beyond a culture of criminalization and incarceration.
[2:29:56.760 --> 2:29:57.760]  That's right.
[2:29:57.760 --> 2:29:59.760]  George Soros is going to teach your local government
[2:29:59.760 --> 2:30:01.760]  where they put in their district attorneys, their mayors,
[2:30:01.760 --> 2:30:06.760]  how to spend your tax money to fund SJWs and George Soros's revolutionaries.
[2:30:06.760 --> 2:30:10.760]  So what my thoughts are and what I'm actually doing
[2:30:10.760 --> 2:30:14.760]  is I am soon to be appointed for a city council position
[2:30:14.760 --> 2:30:19.760]  and I'm taking a city planning commission appointment also.
[2:30:19.760 --> 2:30:21.760]  I have to get involved.
[2:30:21.760 --> 2:30:22.760]  That's right.
[2:30:22.760 --> 2:30:24.760]  Good people want to hang out with their kids and go fishing.
[2:30:24.760 --> 2:30:27.760]  We have to take the government over legally and lawfully now.
[2:30:27.760 --> 2:30:29.760]  And all you got to do is expose sorrows as doing it
[2:30:29.760 --> 2:30:31.760]  and all these district attorneys are literally saying
[2:30:31.760 --> 2:30:34.760]  that you're allowed to rob white people's houses.
[2:30:34.760 --> 2:30:36.760]  I mean, these are communists, folks,
[2:30:36.760 --> 2:30:39.760]  using race as their operating system.
[2:30:39.760 --> 2:30:40.760]  Horrible.
[2:30:40.760 --> 2:30:41.760]  He's a Nazi collaborator.
[2:30:41.760 --> 2:30:46.760]  Soros during World War II went and found hidden Jews
[2:30:46.760 --> 2:30:48.760]  and rounded them up and took their money.
[2:30:48.760 --> 2:30:50.760]  He looked like he was 12 when he was 14 started it.
[2:30:50.760 --> 2:30:52.760]  He was a little bitty, reportedly.
[2:30:52.760 --> 2:30:55.760]  And he would go ferret outward Jews were and steal their money.
[2:30:55.760 --> 2:30:58.760]  He is a hardcore killer.
[2:30:58.760 --> 2:31:01.760]  He is just imagine who this guy is.
[2:31:01.760 --> 2:31:04.760]  And he runs the ADL, he runs everything now.
[2:31:04.760 --> 2:31:05.760]  So think about that.
[2:31:05.760 --> 2:31:08.760]  One of the main ADL funders is a literal Nazi collaborator
[2:31:08.760 --> 2:31:11.760]  that told 60 Minutes the best time in his life
[2:31:11.760 --> 2:31:15.760]  of happy making that's a term he used.
[2:31:15.760 --> 2:31:17.760]  Exhilarating is a term he used.
[2:31:17.760 --> 2:31:21.760]  But there were Jews like him that helped round up the other Jews.
[2:31:21.760 --> 2:31:23.760]  And that's what the ADL is now.
[2:31:23.760 --> 2:31:25.760]  And actually it's been for a long time.
[2:31:25.760 --> 2:31:27.760]  It's there to shepherd Jews into destruction.
[2:31:27.760 --> 2:31:29.760]  And it's absolutely dangerous.
[2:31:29.760 --> 2:31:30.760]  Anything else, sir?
[2:31:30.760 --> 2:31:32.760]  Yeah, I guess just to finish my point.
[2:31:32.760 --> 2:31:34.760]  I just want to be left alone.
[2:31:34.760 --> 2:31:38.760]  But I feel like I have the moral obligation to take this on
[2:31:38.760 --> 2:31:41.760]  because I can't just sit there and complain on Facebook.
[2:31:41.760 --> 2:31:43.760]  It's not getting me anywhere.
[2:31:43.760 --> 2:31:45.760]  You're trying to get out of quicksand.
[2:31:45.760 --> 2:31:47.760]  And you don't have to be like Democrats
[2:31:47.760 --> 2:31:49.760]  and infiltrate government to get power.
[2:31:49.760 --> 2:31:51.760]  You can be out in the open who you are and now's the time.
[2:31:51.760 --> 2:31:52.760]  God bless you.
[2:31:52.760 --> 2:31:53.760]  All right, let's take a call.
[2:31:53.760 --> 2:31:55.760]  Let's take a call from LD and Nevada
[2:31:55.760 --> 2:31:57.760]  on human trafficking, Michael Jackson, The Mask and More.
[2:31:57.760 --> 2:31:58.760]  Go ahead.
[2:31:58.760 --> 2:31:59.760]  Hello, Alex.
[2:31:59.760 --> 2:32:00.760]  Hi, LD.
[2:32:00.760 --> 2:32:01.760]  How are you?
[2:32:01.760 --> 2:32:02.760]  I'm all right.
[2:32:02.760 --> 2:32:03.760]  Good.
[2:32:03.760 --> 2:32:07.760]  First, I would like to say that you've exposed a lot of things
[2:32:07.760 --> 2:32:10.760]  and given us a lot of information about things
[2:32:10.760 --> 2:32:13.760]  we probably wouldn't have ever known about.
[2:32:13.760 --> 2:32:16.760]  But yesterday I was surprised at the very tail end of your show.
[2:32:16.760 --> 2:32:19.760]  You were talking about the chop in Portland
[2:32:19.760 --> 2:32:23.760]  and these people parading a baby around with the mask on
[2:32:23.760 --> 2:32:27.760]  and how child traffickers use masks to hide the identity of children
[2:32:27.760 --> 2:32:31.760]  and you go right into saying like Michael Jackson.
[2:32:31.760 --> 2:32:33.760]  But the show just dropped from there
[2:32:33.760 --> 2:32:38.760]  and there wasn't any sort of like evidence or proof
[2:32:38.760 --> 2:32:41.760]  that Michael Jackson was trafficking children.
[2:32:41.760 --> 2:32:42.760]  So that kind of blew me away.
[2:32:42.760 --> 2:32:47.760]  They put an image of Michael Jackson with the mask on himself
[2:32:47.760 --> 2:32:50.760]  and making the kids wear masks worried about pneumonia.
[2:32:50.760 --> 2:32:52.760]  And I'm just saying it's all part of this weirdness.
[2:32:52.760 --> 2:32:55.760]  And I think, here's the thing, a lot of people like Michael Jackson.
[2:32:55.760 --> 2:32:57.760]  I like a lot of his music.
[2:32:57.760 --> 2:32:59.760]  A lot of people that knew Michael Jackson
[2:32:59.760 --> 2:33:02.760]  who were friends with him, they said he wasn't into kids.
[2:33:02.760 --> 2:33:05.760]  He said he was abused as a child, so he thought he was a child.
[2:33:05.760 --> 2:33:08.760]  But there are recordings of him giving five-year-olds wine
[2:33:08.760 --> 2:33:10.760]  and the Jesus Jews and him bombed out of his brain
[2:33:10.760 --> 2:33:13.760]  and him, you know, dangling kids over railings.
[2:33:13.760 --> 2:33:16.760]  And so is there proof that he had sex with children?
[2:33:16.760 --> 2:33:17.760]  No.
[2:33:17.760 --> 2:33:19.760]  Was he on drugs and whacked out of his brain
[2:33:19.760 --> 2:33:21.760]  and died of the same stuff Prince died of
[2:33:21.760 --> 2:33:24.760]  and the same stuff that Tom Petty died of?
[2:33:24.760 --> 2:33:25.760]  Yes.
[2:33:25.760 --> 2:33:26.760]  So, LD, I'll come back to you.
[2:33:26.760 --> 2:33:28.760]  Then I've got some COVID-19 news I'm going to add.
[2:33:28.760 --> 2:33:30.760]  We'll do more calls in a few minutes to the next hour.
[2:33:30.760 --> 2:33:32.760]  And then Gerald Stalente takes over.
[2:33:32.760 --> 2:33:33.760]  Please stay with us.
[2:33:46.760 --> 2:33:48.760]  Where the hell did this water come from?
[2:33:49.760 --> 2:33:50.760]  Where did it come from?
[2:33:50.760 --> 2:33:51.760]  Where did it come from?
[2:33:51.760 --> 2:33:54.760]  Where did it come from?

[2:36:00.760 --> 2:36:10.760]  This is the brave new world.
[2:36:10.760 --> 2:36:12.760]  It's the post-human world.
[2:36:12.760 --> 2:36:14.760]  It's the dreaming of the post-human world.
[2:36:14.760 --> 2:36:17.760]  The Wired Magazine and the Wall Street Journal
[2:36:17.760 --> 2:36:19.760]  all tell us about it.
[2:36:19.760 --> 2:36:21.760]  Oh, now they tell us our smart phones don't just track
[2:36:21.760 --> 2:36:22.760]  or remove.
[2:36:22.760 --> 2:36:24.760]  They're monitoring our psychology
[2:36:24.760 --> 2:36:27.760]  and sending it back to a corporate database globally.
[2:36:27.760 --> 2:36:31.760]  You see, the bear trap closed on our leg now
[2:36:31.760 --> 2:36:33.760]  and the vampire walked out of the bushes
[2:36:33.760 --> 2:36:35.760]  and is explaining to us how he's slowly
[2:36:35.760 --> 2:36:38.760]  gonna bleed us and destroy us.
[2:36:38.760 --> 2:36:41.760]  A lot of you have been listening for more than 20 years.
[2:36:41.760 --> 2:36:43.760]  And if you go back to those shows,
[2:36:43.760 --> 2:36:45.760]  we laid out the AI takeover plan,
[2:36:45.760 --> 2:36:47.760]  the tracking of cell phones,
[2:36:47.760 --> 2:36:49.760]  how programmed master computers
[2:36:49.760 --> 2:36:52.760]  would manipulate control society,
[2:36:52.760 --> 2:36:54.760]  how they'd be able to not just predict
[2:36:54.760 --> 2:36:57.760]  large groups of human movements and activities
[2:36:57.760 --> 2:36:59.760]  but even predict what individuals would do.
[2:36:59.760 --> 2:37:01.760]  And then once you could predict what individuals
[2:37:01.760 --> 2:37:04.760]  were gonna be doing, you could add stimuli
[2:37:04.760 --> 2:37:07.760]  through the AI systems, through the computers,
[2:37:07.760 --> 2:37:10.760]  through digital billboards, through face scanning,
[2:37:10.760 --> 2:37:12.760]  through the social credit score to control people
[2:37:12.760 --> 2:37:14.760]  and make them act like you want it to.
[2:37:14.760 --> 2:37:17.760]  But when we cover that, the media would attack us
[2:37:17.760 --> 2:37:19.760]  and say we were making it up.
[2:37:19.760 --> 2:37:21.760]  It was a conspiracy theory, even though it was in
[2:37:21.760 --> 2:37:23.760]  the actual corporate level blueprint documents.
[2:37:23.760 --> 2:37:25.760]  Well, the next level of the blueprint documents
[2:37:25.760 --> 2:37:28.760]  explained to us that they are setting up this control system
[2:37:28.760 --> 2:37:31.760]  to make humans obsolete and phase us out.
[2:37:31.760 --> 2:37:34.760]  And it's something about a thousand times crazier
[2:37:34.760 --> 2:37:35.760]  than what Hitler planned.
[2:37:35.760 --> 2:37:38.760]  So we might want to dismantle the system now.
[2:37:49.760 --> 2:37:51.760]  The other thing is that I thought was interesting
[2:37:51.760 --> 2:37:54.760]  and a smart move is that Senator Hawley said,
[2:37:54.760 --> 2:37:57.760]  to the NBA commissioner, let's have a meeting.
[2:37:57.760 --> 2:37:58.760]  Let's talk about this.
[2:37:58.760 --> 2:38:01.760]  I mean, that's a good way to actually have civil discourse
[2:38:01.760 --> 2:38:03.760]  and perhaps help solve an issue.
[2:38:03.760 --> 2:38:07.760]  Yeah, Hawley also said, don't suspend this guy.
[2:38:07.760 --> 2:38:10.760]  Have him do some reporting on the NBA's relationship with China.
[2:38:10.760 --> 2:38:12.760]  The NBA has been cozying up to Beijing
[2:38:12.760 --> 2:38:15.760]  after getting kicked off Chinese television some months ago
[2:38:15.760 --> 2:38:18.760]  after a Houston Rockets executive had tweeted
[2:38:18.760 --> 2:38:21.760]  in favor of the pro-democracy protesters in Hong Kong.
[2:38:21.760 --> 2:38:24.760]  And so I'm thinking if Adrian Woj,
[2:38:24.760 --> 2:38:26.760]  as he's called on the air, had just said,
[2:38:26.760 --> 2:38:28.760]  you don't know what you're talking about, Senator.
[2:38:28.760 --> 2:38:29.760]  Here's why this is no problem.
[2:38:29.760 --> 2:38:31.760]  By the way, is he a defender of the NBA?
[2:38:31.760 --> 2:38:32.760]  Or is he covering the NBA?
[2:38:32.760 --> 2:38:33.760]  Everyone would have thought that was fine.
[2:38:33.760 --> 2:38:34.760]  He could have said it on the air.
[2:38:34.760 --> 2:38:38.760]  When you start dropping F-bombs, not a good career move.
[2:38:38.760 --> 2:38:41.760]  Oh, you just revealed what the word was.
[2:38:41.760 --> 2:38:42.760]  Howie D.
[2:38:42.760 --> 2:38:57.760]  All right, Senator Josh Hawley has come out and said
[2:38:57.760 --> 2:38:59.760]  that we need to basically criminally investigate the NBA
[2:38:59.760 --> 2:39:01.760]  for being under Chinese government control.
[2:39:01.760 --> 2:39:02.760]  Yeah, let's start with Hollywood.
[2:39:02.760 --> 2:39:06.760]  Four of the big six outfits are totally owned by it.
[2:39:06.760 --> 2:39:10.760]  And you can see the anti-American builds that comes out
[2:39:10.760 --> 2:39:12.760]  while the NBA ranks in billions from China.
[2:39:12.760 --> 2:39:15.760]  Beijing makes clear this morning they expect the NBA
[2:39:15.760 --> 2:39:19.760]  to suppress any dissent on Hong Kong, the Uyghurs,
[2:39:19.760 --> 2:39:21.760]  those three million Muslims and death camps,
[2:39:21.760 --> 2:39:25.760]  walk-to-walk Chinese state press orders, Adam Silver.
[2:39:25.760 --> 2:39:27.760]  Will ESPN report this?
[2:39:27.760 --> 2:39:30.760]  The answer is, hell no.
[2:39:30.760 --> 2:39:32.760]  Because these big corporations are globalist
[2:39:32.760 --> 2:39:35.760]  and they help set up China and they like the communism
[2:39:35.760 --> 2:39:36.760]  and they like the evil.
[2:39:36.760 --> 2:39:38.760]  All right, LD in Nevada.
[2:39:38.760 --> 2:39:40.760]  You heard my point on Michael Jackson,
[2:39:40.760 --> 2:39:44.760]  just the mask wearing, making the kids wear the mask.
[2:39:44.760 --> 2:39:45.760]  I mean, all that's weird.
[2:39:45.760 --> 2:39:47.760]  What's your view on Michael Jackson?
[2:39:47.760 --> 2:39:48.760]  You know, I did.
[2:39:48.760 --> 2:39:50.760]  And thank you for giving me a chance to respond.
[2:39:50.760 --> 2:39:52.760]  I'll respond to some of the things you said.
[2:39:52.760 --> 2:39:56.760]  From what I understand with the skin disease that he had,
[2:39:56.760 --> 2:40:01.760]  the skin condition, he had an immune...
[2:40:01.760 --> 2:40:05.760]  immunology, he had an issue with his immune system.
[2:40:05.760 --> 2:40:08.760]  It's a breakdown of the immune system
[2:40:08.760 --> 2:40:10.760]  and I think that's why he wore a mask.
[2:40:10.760 --> 2:40:12.760]  Now, I've only seen maybe one or two pictures
[2:40:12.760 --> 2:40:14.760]  of children wearing masks with him,
[2:40:14.760 --> 2:40:18.760]  but a lot of those children like to dress like him, too.
[2:40:18.760 --> 2:40:21.760]  I mean, there are a lot of people that are big fans
[2:40:21.760 --> 2:40:24.760]  of Michael Jackson and there's never been evidence
[2:40:24.760 --> 2:40:25.760]  that he penetrated children,
[2:40:25.760 --> 2:40:27.760]  but he was reportedly raped by his dad
[2:40:27.760 --> 2:40:29.760]  and a bunch of other crazy stuff
[2:40:29.760 --> 2:40:31.760]  and so he was a childlike mind.
[2:40:31.760 --> 2:40:36.760]  And so my point was is that it's weird Hollywood,
[2:40:36.760 --> 2:40:39.760]  the mask, the head of Google, Eric Schmidt,
[2:40:39.760 --> 2:40:43.760]  used to be caught hurting women on his pleasure jet,
[2:40:43.760 --> 2:40:46.760]  his jumbo jet, with stockings over their heads
[2:40:46.760 --> 2:40:47.760]  so you couldn't see them.
[2:40:47.760 --> 2:40:49.760]  So my point is a way to traffic children
[2:40:49.760 --> 2:40:51.760]  is to have their faces covered.
[2:40:51.760 --> 2:40:53.760]  And psychiatrists and psychologists came out and said
[2:40:53.760 --> 2:40:56.760]  the TSA touching children was grooming behavior,
[2:40:56.760 --> 2:40:57.760]  not the TSA themselves,
[2:40:57.760 --> 2:40:59.760]  but Congress having those regulations.
[2:40:59.760 --> 2:41:01.760]  The TSA didn't want to do it.
[2:41:01.760 --> 2:41:02.760]  So they complained and said,
[2:41:02.760 --> 2:41:04.760]  we're not going to do this to the five-year-olds.
[2:41:04.760 --> 2:41:05.760]  That is the way to groom children
[2:41:05.760 --> 2:41:07.760]  so when it really happens, they will submit to it.
[2:41:07.760 --> 2:41:08.760]  Do you understand?
[2:41:08.760 --> 2:41:09.760]  I do understand.
[2:41:09.760 --> 2:41:11.760]  It was just strange how you went from that
[2:41:11.760 --> 2:41:12.760]  to Michael Jackson.
[2:41:12.760 --> 2:41:13.760]  He was in a part of the conversation.
[2:41:13.760 --> 2:41:14.760]  Sure, sure.
[2:41:14.760 --> 2:41:16.760]  I mean, I have a tendency to just, you know,
[2:41:16.760 --> 2:41:18.760]  when we're running out of time on the show to do that.
[2:41:18.760 --> 2:41:19.760]  Let's say this real quickly.
[2:41:19.760 --> 2:41:22.760]  He only hung one child over the balcony that was his.
[2:41:22.760 --> 2:41:24.760]  He didn't give those children wine
[2:41:24.760 --> 2:41:27.760]  and something else you said,
[2:41:27.760 --> 2:41:31.760]  he died of propofol, Prince died of fentanyl.
[2:41:31.760 --> 2:41:32.760]  Whatever, man.
[2:41:32.760 --> 2:41:34.760]  They're on a bunch of hardcore opiates,
[2:41:34.760 --> 2:41:35.760]  is what I'm saying.
[2:41:35.760 --> 2:41:37.760]  With the network, we're Christian.
[2:41:37.760 --> 2:41:38.760]  We're Christian.
[2:41:38.760 --> 2:41:39.760]  I'm Christian too.
[2:41:39.760 --> 2:41:40.760]  Born again, spirit filled, dude.
[2:41:40.760 --> 2:41:42.760]  We got, we got to be, we got to be.
[2:41:42.760 --> 2:41:44.760]  Well, I mean, listen, I'm not a,
[2:41:44.760 --> 2:41:46.760]  I'm not a pharmacist,
[2:41:46.760 --> 2:41:48.760]  but I remember he was on a whole bunch of those drugs.
[2:41:48.760 --> 2:41:49.760]  I remember reading.
[2:41:49.760 --> 2:41:50.760]  He died of the same thing as Prince
[2:41:50.760 --> 2:41:51.760]  and I thought it was fentanyl,
[2:41:51.760 --> 2:41:53.760]  but it might have been some medical grade of it.
[2:41:53.760 --> 2:41:54.760]  It's kind of like,
[2:41:54.760 --> 2:41:57.760]  it's kind of like they got Valium
[2:41:57.760 --> 2:41:59.760]  and they got a different,
[2:41:59.760 --> 2:42:00.760]  they got one type of Xanax
[2:42:00.760 --> 2:42:01.760]  and they got a time release Xanax,
[2:42:01.760 --> 2:42:03.760]  so not my intended to save.
[2:42:03.760 --> 2:42:04.760]  You know, quite frankly,
[2:42:04.760 --> 2:42:07.760]  I think Michael Jackson was weird, man.
[2:42:07.760 --> 2:42:08.760]  So I appreciate your call.
[2:42:08.760 --> 2:42:10.760]  I mean, I just, I mean, I'll tell you,
[2:42:10.760 --> 2:42:12.760]  I think Michael Jackson was creepy.
[2:42:12.760 --> 2:42:16.760]  Now, do I go off on Michael Jackson all day long?
[2:42:16.760 --> 2:42:17.760]  No.
[2:42:17.760 --> 2:42:19.760]  Would I send my kids to some place
[2:42:19.760 --> 2:42:21.760]  that had a neverland on it?
[2:42:21.760 --> 2:42:24.760]  Some, you know, weird rich guy in Hollywood
[2:42:24.760 --> 2:42:25.760]  and leave him over there
[2:42:25.760 --> 2:42:27.760]  and have him sleep in the bed with him?
[2:42:27.760 --> 2:42:30.760]  H-E-L-L, no.
[2:42:30.760 --> 2:42:33.760]  I think Michael Jackson was a mind control victim
[2:42:33.760 --> 2:42:34.760]  tortured by his family.
[2:42:34.760 --> 2:42:35.760]  Okay.
[2:42:35.760 --> 2:42:37.760]  Let's go ahead and take more calls here.
[2:42:37.760 --> 2:42:39.760]  I want to hit some of this COVID-19 too.
[2:42:39.760 --> 2:42:41.760]  Let's do some of the longest here.
[2:42:41.760 --> 2:42:43.760]  That'd be Harrison in Oklahoma.
[2:42:43.760 --> 2:42:45.760]  Harrison, thanks for calling.
[2:42:45.760 --> 2:42:46.760]  Hey, Alex.
[2:42:46.760 --> 2:42:47.760]  How's it going?
[2:42:47.760 --> 2:42:48.760]  Good, brother.
[2:42:48.760 --> 2:42:49.760]  Welcome.
[2:42:49.760 --> 2:42:50.760]  Thank you.
[2:42:50.760 --> 2:42:53.760]  I just wanted to share a personal experience with you today.
[2:42:53.760 --> 2:42:54.760]  What's going on?
[2:42:54.760 --> 2:42:56.760]  About the, regarding COVID.
[2:42:56.760 --> 2:42:59.760]  So, so it was last, last week,
[2:42:59.760 --> 2:43:01.760]  the week before, July 1st,
[2:43:01.760 --> 2:43:06.760]  I called into work with the headache, migraine,
[2:43:06.760 --> 2:43:09.760]  and I was just sore, my whole body.
[2:43:09.760 --> 2:43:14.760]  And the doctor asked me if I had any of the COVID symptoms
[2:43:14.760 --> 2:43:17.760]  as far as like fever, sore throat, any of that stuff.
[2:43:17.760 --> 2:43:20.760]  And I said no, none of those.
[2:43:20.760 --> 2:43:24.760]  And he put me down as the COVID anyway.
[2:43:24.760 --> 2:43:28.760]  So that's, that's in my teledoc medical file
[2:43:28.760 --> 2:43:34.760]  that, that I have COVID even though I said no to all the symptoms.
[2:43:34.760 --> 2:43:35.760]  And he didn't do a test.
[2:43:35.760 --> 2:43:40.760]  Well, that's, that's the NIH guidelines is that if you
[2:43:40.760 --> 2:43:43.760]  have anything, basically you, you have it,
[2:43:43.760 --> 2:43:45.760]  but, but again, America's bad.
[2:43:45.760 --> 2:43:48.760]  We have the record number of cases because now they have this new
[2:43:48.760 --> 2:43:49.760]  policy to count everything.
[2:43:49.760 --> 2:43:52.760]  I mean, think about how synthetic and fraudulent that is,
[2:43:52.760 --> 2:43:55.760]  but the big corporations, they line up in lockstep, don't they?
[2:43:55.760 --> 2:43:56.760]  Oh, exactly.
[2:43:56.760 --> 2:43:57.760]  Yeah, yeah.
[2:43:57.760 --> 2:43:59.760]  I mean, just, it's almost as if just being, just living,
[2:43:59.760 --> 2:44:00.760]  you have COVID.
[2:44:00.760 --> 2:44:01.760]  What did you say?
[2:44:01.760 --> 2:44:04.760]  Well, that's actually what the city council up in Dallas
[2:44:04.760 --> 2:44:07.760]  in the, in the suburb there in a Denton said,
[2:44:07.760 --> 2:44:10.760]  they said, you could basically, everybody's got COVID.
[2:44:10.760 --> 2:44:13.760]  But, but in the end, everyone will have COVID because if you've
[2:44:13.760 --> 2:44:17.760]  ever had coronavirus habit, everybody's had a cold, right?
[2:44:17.760 --> 2:44:18.760]  Yeah.
[2:44:18.760 --> 2:44:19.760]  We've all had colds in our lives.
[2:44:19.760 --> 2:44:20.760]  We've had the coronavirus.
[2:44:20.760 --> 2:44:21.760]  It's the Corona family.
[2:44:21.760 --> 2:44:25.760]  It's COVID-19 is a manipulated version of it.
[2:44:25.760 --> 2:44:28.760]  Where do you think this is all going, Harrison?
[2:44:28.760 --> 2:44:29.760]  Oh, geez.
[2:44:29.760 --> 2:44:31.760]  I mean, it's obviously going somewhere.
[2:44:31.760 --> 2:44:36.760]  I mean, there's no telling, you know, I mean,
[2:44:36.760 --> 2:44:41.760]  there are definitely signs that sort of point in the direction.
[2:44:41.760 --> 2:44:44.760]  And I think we'll all, the majority of us will,
[2:44:44.760 --> 2:44:45.760]  we'll all find out one day.
[2:44:45.760 --> 2:44:47.760]  Well, were we going to ask me a second ago?
[2:44:47.760 --> 2:44:51.760]  I was going to ask that final little thing.
[2:44:51.760 --> 2:44:53.760]  Did you say something to your doctor?
[2:44:53.760 --> 2:44:55.760]  Did you say, hey dude, I'd call up and say,
[2:44:55.760 --> 2:44:57.760]  get that out of my medical records because you know,
[2:44:57.760 --> 2:44:59.760]  they're going to mess with folks that have a wreck because
[2:44:59.760 --> 2:45:01.760]  they're not saying, oh, you never really get well from it.
[2:45:01.760 --> 2:45:04.760]  There'll be some new special DNA vaccine you've got to get
[2:45:04.760 --> 2:45:06.760]  before you can ever have a job again.
[2:45:06.760 --> 2:45:07.760]  I mean, let me blame me folks.
[2:45:07.760 --> 2:45:08.760]  You don't want to be tested.
[2:45:08.760 --> 2:45:10.760]  You don't want to be on record having this.
[2:45:10.760 --> 2:45:11.760]  Go ahead.
[2:45:11.760 --> 2:45:12.760]  Oh yeah.
[2:45:12.760 --> 2:45:13.760]  Yeah, exactly.
[2:45:13.760 --> 2:45:16.760]  But no, I said no to everything.
[2:45:16.760 --> 2:45:19.760]  And so yeah, I was just surprised a bit when,
[2:45:19.760 --> 2:45:23.760]  and I took a screenshot of it too through the teledoc app.
[2:45:23.760 --> 2:45:26.760]  And they're also diagnosing folks.
[2:45:26.760 --> 2:45:27.760]  That's right.
[2:45:27.760 --> 2:45:29.760]  Over zoom and over sky.
[2:45:29.760 --> 2:45:30.760]  Oh, you got the snipples.
[2:45:30.760 --> 2:45:32.760]  You got the COVID son.
[2:45:32.760 --> 2:45:33.760]  Give me a favor.
[2:45:33.760 --> 2:45:34.760]  Showtipstemfullwars.com.
[2:45:34.760 --> 2:45:35.760]  Black out your name.
[2:45:35.760 --> 2:45:37.760]  White out your name.
[2:45:37.760 --> 2:45:38.760]  Oh, that's racist too.
[2:45:38.760 --> 2:45:40.760]  You know, cover up your name and info.
[2:45:40.760 --> 2:45:42.760]  And we'd like to have more of that to show people.
[2:45:42.760 --> 2:45:43.760]  Thank you.
[2:45:43.760 --> 2:45:44.760]  All right.
[2:45:44.760 --> 2:45:45.760]  I want to try to jam.
[2:45:45.760 --> 2:45:47.760]  Mike, Mike, Simon, Isaac, and John in.
[2:45:47.760 --> 2:45:49.760]  I've been going to the order that calls are received.
[2:45:49.760 --> 2:45:51.760]  And we're almost out of time here.
[2:45:51.760 --> 2:45:54.760]  I've got Selente come up about 15 minutes.
[2:45:54.760 --> 2:45:56.760]  Just briefly free shipping does in today.
[2:45:56.760 --> 2:45:57.760]  Double patriot points.
[2:45:57.760 --> 2:46:02.760]  The X2, the X3, the, the winter sun, all those 50% off
[2:46:02.760 --> 2:46:04.760]  store-wide free shipping.
[2:46:04.760 --> 2:46:05.760]  We have to end the sale.
[2:46:05.760 --> 2:46:07.760]  I haven't had time to come up with a new sale.
[2:46:07.760 --> 2:46:09.760]  And the supply chain's breaking down.
[2:46:09.760 --> 2:46:10.760]  And it's just totally insane.
[2:46:10.760 --> 2:46:12.760]  We have all this stuff in stock right now, but get it.
[2:46:12.760 --> 2:46:13.760]  And it funds the M4.
[2:46:13.760 --> 2:46:15.760]  So I want to thank you all for your support.
[2:46:15.760 --> 2:46:18.760]  Let's jam in one more.
[2:46:18.760 --> 2:46:21.760]  Let's go ahead and talk to Isaac in California.
[2:46:21.760 --> 2:46:25.760]  Isaac, you're on the year.
[2:46:25.760 --> 2:46:26.760]  Isaac's been on hold.
[2:46:26.760 --> 2:46:27.760]  Hello, Alex.
[2:46:27.760 --> 2:46:28.760]  Hey, welcome, sir.
[2:46:28.760 --> 2:46:29.760]  Thanks for calling.
[2:46:29.760 --> 2:46:30.760]  Go ahead.
[2:46:30.760 --> 2:46:33.760]  Hey, Alex, you know, I just want to tell you that you do an
[2:46:33.760 --> 2:46:35.760]  amazing job in America.
[2:46:35.760 --> 2:46:38.760]  Real American loves the job that you're doing.
[2:46:38.760 --> 2:46:39.760]  I'm trying, brother.
[2:46:39.760 --> 2:46:43.760]  I think the biggest problem right now is every man that
[2:46:43.760 --> 2:46:46.760]  considers himself a man out there needs to grab in between
[2:46:46.760 --> 2:46:47.760]  their legs.
[2:46:47.760 --> 2:46:51.760]  And if they got a pair of balls or a child, then you should
[2:46:51.760 --> 2:46:56.760]  understand that this war is not against us, the adults.
[2:46:56.760 --> 2:46:59.760]  This war is against the children.
[2:46:59.760 --> 2:47:00.760]  Our lives.
[2:47:00.760 --> 2:47:02.760]  And we need your children unannounced to be around convicted
[2:47:02.760 --> 2:47:04.760]  pedophiles dressed up like women.
[2:47:04.760 --> 2:47:07.760]  And we need to tell your sons that it's their right to take
[2:47:07.760 --> 2:47:09.760]  pills to have their genitals scribble up.
[2:47:09.760 --> 2:47:11.760]  That's not chemical abuse of children.
[2:47:11.760 --> 2:47:13.760]  That's not medical experiments.
[2:47:13.760 --> 2:47:15.760]  That's it, bro.
[2:47:15.760 --> 2:47:18.760]  Sir, sir, I'm, I'm ADD and I'm ADHD.
[2:47:18.760 --> 2:47:20.760]  I was diagnosed when I was young and I was put on
[2:47:20.760 --> 2:47:24.760]  well-beautiful, riddling, death coat, all of it.
[2:47:24.760 --> 2:47:25.760]  I have no appetite.
[2:47:25.760 --> 2:47:26.760]  Wow, death coat.
[2:47:26.760 --> 2:47:27.760]  That's for seizures.
[2:47:27.760 --> 2:47:28.760]  I mean, everything.
[2:47:28.760 --> 2:47:30.760]  I was put on everything and now I'm 40 years old.
[2:47:30.760 --> 2:47:31.760]  I have no appetite.
[2:47:31.760 --> 2:47:34.760]  I'm able to go two days without eating.
[2:47:34.760 --> 2:47:37.760]  I just like the doctors are the problem.
[2:47:37.760 --> 2:47:42.760]  And if you let them convert your life into whatever they want.
[2:47:42.760 --> 2:47:43.760]  You're right.
[2:47:43.760 --> 2:47:44.760]  There are good doctors and there are bad doctors.
[2:47:44.760 --> 2:47:46.760]  And let me tell you, I've been around it.
[2:47:46.760 --> 2:47:47.760]  I've seen it.
[2:47:47.760 --> 2:47:49.760]  They've got these female drug sellers.
[2:47:49.760 --> 2:47:52.760]  They're from big pharma who are the hottest women I've ever seen.
[2:47:52.760 --> 2:47:55.760]  I mean, I mean, I've been before at medical offices.
[2:47:55.760 --> 2:47:56.760]  No people are in the medical field.
[2:47:56.760 --> 2:47:57.760]  Don't leave it at that.
[2:47:57.760 --> 2:47:59.760]  And a woman walks in so hot, you're like, wow.
[2:47:59.760 --> 2:48:03.760]  I mean, some of the hottest women I've ever seen in my life are the drug reps.
[2:48:03.760 --> 2:48:05.760]  And let me tell you, they have sex with the doctors.
[2:48:05.760 --> 2:48:06.760]  Okay.
[2:48:06.760 --> 2:48:08.760]  They don't just give them cruises and money and all this.
[2:48:08.760 --> 2:48:09.760]  They have sex with them.
[2:48:09.760 --> 2:48:11.760]  And I'm going to leave it at that.
[2:48:11.760 --> 2:48:13.760]  I mean, it's all, it's the real cult.
[2:48:13.760 --> 2:48:15.760]  The medical system is the takeover.
[2:48:15.760 --> 2:48:16.760]  You're absolutely right.
[2:48:16.760 --> 2:48:17.760]  I'm sorry about the time.
[2:48:17.760 --> 2:48:21.760]  Listen, next hour coming up, I'm going to jam in a few more, hit that big COVID news
[2:48:21.760 --> 2:48:23.760]  and the food shortage news I've got.
[2:48:23.760 --> 2:48:25.760]  And then Gerald Salente taking over.
[2:48:25.760 --> 2:48:31.760]  So I was taking care of an errand this morning and I wasn't even close to downtown,
[2:48:31.760 --> 2:48:34.760]  but I was parked a little side street going to this business.
[2:48:34.760 --> 2:48:40.760]  When I came back out, I saw what looked like two Asian folks, probably Chinese,
[2:48:40.760 --> 2:48:43.760]  walking down the sidewalk about 50 yards up ahead of me.
[2:48:43.760 --> 2:48:48.760]  And here I am parked a truck with the windows up and the woman stops and points at me.
[2:48:48.760 --> 2:48:51.760]  So they stopped and they wait while I'm inside my truck.
[2:48:51.760 --> 2:48:56.760]  Truck started and they sit there and stretch keeps pointing and they put their hands out
[2:48:56.760 --> 2:49:02.760]  like they're waiting for me to go because I'm not wearing a mask inside my car.
[2:49:02.760 --> 2:49:04.760]  And so then I just sat there.
[2:49:04.760 --> 2:49:06.760]  So they acted angry and walked past me.
[2:49:06.760 --> 2:49:09.760]  I almost shot a video of it on my phone,
[2:49:09.760 --> 2:49:12.760]  but everybody sees this stuff happening everywhere.
[2:49:12.760 --> 2:49:13.760]  This is mental illness.
[2:49:13.760 --> 2:49:16.760]  People are pulling guns on folks that aren't wearing masks.
[2:49:16.760 --> 2:49:18.760]  This is all cult programming.
[2:49:18.760 --> 2:49:19.760]  This is all about submitting.
[2:49:19.760 --> 2:49:22.760]  We cannot submit to this UN brainwashing.
[2:49:22.760 --> 2:49:24.760]  It's all a giant fraud.
[2:49:24.760 --> 2:49:28.760]  We must expose the fraud or become slaves to it.
[2:49:28.760 --> 2:49:33.760]  Storeable food is again available for shipping within three to four weeks.
[2:49:33.760 --> 2:49:34.760]  We have it.
[2:49:34.760 --> 2:49:37.760]  It's high quality, but it's got to be packaged and shipped out to you.
[2:49:37.760 --> 2:49:39.760]  Some items are shipping in a week, some in four weeks.
[2:49:39.760 --> 2:49:41.760]  So they're saying three to four weeks.
[2:49:41.760 --> 2:49:42.760]  It's my patriot.
[2:49:42.760 --> 2:49:43.760]  They have their full catalog.
[2:49:43.760 --> 2:49:46.760]  They're in our back end at info wars store.com.
[2:49:46.760 --> 2:49:51.760]  Get your orders in now before the next big surge comes in.
[2:49:51.760 --> 2:49:54.760]  Believe me, every angle I've looked at tells me
[2:49:54.760 --> 2:49:56.760]  that really, really serious times are ahead,
[2:49:56.760 --> 2:49:58.760]  whether Trump wins or loses.
[2:49:58.760 --> 2:50:00.760]  The globalists have already created a world by depression,
[2:50:00.760 --> 2:50:04.760]  lockdowns on the planetary scale, and it's only intensifying.
[2:50:04.760 --> 2:50:06.760]  This is one of the big boxes.
[2:50:06.760 --> 2:50:07.760]  You've got to get checked off.
[2:50:07.760 --> 2:50:09.760]  It's high quality, storeable food.
[2:50:09.760 --> 2:50:13.760]  My patriot has really good, high quality food at a very affordable price.
[2:50:13.760 --> 2:50:15.760]  And the packaging is the best you're going to find out there.

[2:50:51.760 --> 2:50:55.760]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, we are back broadcasting worldwide.
[2:50:55.760 --> 2:50:56.760]  Love our callers.
[2:50:56.760 --> 2:50:58.760]  We don't screen your calls other than where you're calling from
[2:50:58.760 --> 2:51:00.760]  and what your topic is.
[2:51:00.760 --> 2:51:02.760]  I was just talking to one of the producers.
[2:51:02.760 --> 2:51:06.760]  And these great callers call in and plug the products.
[2:51:06.760 --> 2:51:09.760]  And I've seen news articles out there.
[2:51:09.760 --> 2:51:12.760]  And I've seen, we've had guests ask,
[2:51:12.760 --> 2:51:15.760]  hey, are those fake callers I hear?
[2:51:15.760 --> 2:51:18.760]  As if I have time and energy to fake stuff around here.
[2:51:18.760 --> 2:51:20.760]  This is all completely real.
[2:51:20.760 --> 2:51:23.760]  That's what's frustrating about it is people are so used to fraud,
[2:51:23.760 --> 2:51:25.760]  they don't know something real.
[2:51:25.760 --> 2:51:29.760]  When they're seeing, this is people actually trying to tell the truth,
[2:51:29.760 --> 2:51:32.760]  actually trying to figure out what's going on.
[2:51:32.760 --> 2:51:36.760]  So call in sometime and experience it for yourself.
[2:51:36.760 --> 2:51:39.760]  It's real, you'll be on air, real things are happening.
[2:51:39.760 --> 2:51:41.760]  This is a real world.
[2:51:41.760 --> 2:51:43.760]  But see, the establishment stage is so much stuff,
[2:51:43.760 --> 2:51:46.760]  they can't believe that we're not staged.
[2:51:46.760 --> 2:51:48.760]  They also think I'm reading off teleprompters.
[2:51:48.760 --> 2:51:50.760]  A big screen that shows your calls,
[2:51:50.760 --> 2:51:53.760]  and that I'm having trouble saying a word wrong or something.
[2:51:53.760 --> 2:51:55.760]  They'll put it up there like once a day.
[2:51:55.760 --> 2:51:57.760]  Hey, you're pronouncing that wrong.
[2:51:57.760 --> 2:51:59.760]  But in fact, maybe we can swing that jib around.
[2:51:59.760 --> 2:52:01.760]  Want to show folks the jib?
[2:52:01.760 --> 2:52:04.760]  That's the teleprompter right there.
[2:52:04.760 --> 2:52:06.760]  Where you're calling from and stuff like that.
[2:52:06.760 --> 2:52:07.760]  That's it.
[2:52:07.760 --> 2:52:08.760]  There's nothing else.
[2:52:08.760 --> 2:52:10.760]  In fact, swing that jib around 360 if you can.
[2:52:10.760 --> 2:52:13.760]  Show them a whole evil studio.
[2:52:13.760 --> 2:52:15.760]  They got the big studio walls.
[2:52:15.760 --> 2:52:17.760]  You got the desk, everything else.
[2:52:17.760 --> 2:52:19.760]  You swing back around.
[2:52:19.760 --> 2:52:21.760]  You got cameras.
[2:52:21.760 --> 2:52:23.760]  No man behind the curtain.
[2:52:23.760 --> 2:52:25.760]  Tell me what to say.
[2:52:25.760 --> 2:52:27.760]  Just to research the information,
[2:52:27.760 --> 2:52:29.760]  and the Holy Spirit when I'm pointed at God.
[2:52:29.760 --> 2:52:32.760]  Sometimes I kind of turn around and get pointed towards Satan.
[2:52:32.760 --> 2:52:34.760]  If I get turned around the right way.
[2:52:34.760 --> 2:52:36.760]  So there you go, ladies and gentlemen.
[2:52:36.760 --> 2:52:38.760]  That's what's in here right now.
[2:52:38.760 --> 2:52:40.760]  Got a boom operator and a crew behind the window right there.
[2:52:40.760 --> 2:52:42.760]  In fact, let's just fly in there and show some of the folks
[2:52:42.760 --> 2:52:44.760]  through the blocked out window.
[2:52:44.760 --> 2:52:46.760]  It distracted me when the window was clear.
[2:52:46.760 --> 2:52:47.760]  It was clear.
[2:52:47.760 --> 2:52:48.760]  It was clear.
[2:52:48.760 --> 2:52:49.760]  It was clear.
[2:52:49.760 --> 2:52:50.760]  It was clear.
[2:52:50.760 --> 2:52:51.760]  Put a film over.
[2:52:51.760 --> 2:52:53.760]  It's very racist to put a film over something.
[2:52:53.760 --> 2:52:54.760]  Everything's racist.
[2:52:54.760 --> 2:52:56.760]  Oh, there's a painting on the wall too.
[2:52:56.760 --> 2:52:58.760]  It's a nice painting over there.
[2:52:58.760 --> 2:53:00.760]  Of a nice mountain scene at twilight.
[2:53:00.760 --> 2:53:01.760]  Maybe it's dawn.
[2:53:01.760 --> 2:53:03.760]  You can see the morning star.
[2:53:03.760 --> 2:53:05.760]  Okay, enough of that.
[2:53:05.760 --> 2:53:06.760]  Let's go ahead.
[2:53:06.760 --> 2:53:08.760]  And we were just talking about that earlier though.
[2:53:08.760 --> 2:53:10.760]  Let's talk to John in Texas.
[2:53:10.760 --> 2:53:11.760]  Thanks for holding.
[2:53:11.760 --> 2:53:12.760]  Hey, Alex.
[2:53:12.760 --> 2:53:13.760]  Can you hear me?
[2:53:13.760 --> 2:53:14.760]  Yes, sir.
[2:53:14.760 --> 2:53:18.760]  I'm going to get out of here because I know you were short on time.
[2:53:18.760 --> 2:53:23.760]  So, yeah, really quick charge to all the people who claim to love God.
[2:53:23.760 --> 2:53:25.760]  And I'm not trying to be a priest.
[2:53:25.760 --> 2:53:27.760]  I'm not trying to be a fairy.
[2:53:27.760 --> 2:53:29.760]  Just talk closer to the phone.
[2:53:29.760 --> 2:53:31.760]  Hey, can you hear me?
[2:53:31.760 --> 2:53:32.760]  Yeah, I can't.
[2:53:32.760 --> 2:53:33.760]  Yeah.
[2:53:33.760 --> 2:53:34.760]  I'm not a priest.
[2:53:34.760 --> 2:53:36.760]  I'm not a saint.
[2:53:36.760 --> 2:53:37.760]  I'm not a Pharisee.
[2:53:37.760 --> 2:53:39.760]  I'm nothing perfect.
[2:53:39.760 --> 2:53:40.760]  Sure.
[2:53:40.760 --> 2:53:41.760]  You're just warning folks.
[2:53:41.760 --> 2:53:43.760]  So tell us what you're going to say.
[2:53:43.760 --> 2:53:50.760]  So if you're on the fence about fighting globalism and fighting tyranny and fighting communism
[2:53:50.760 --> 2:53:56.760]  that you see all around you, I would highly charge you and warn you to get off because
[2:53:56.760 --> 2:53:58.760]  the devil owns the fence.
[2:53:58.760 --> 2:53:59.760]  Satan owns the fence.
[2:53:59.760 --> 2:54:02.760]  He doesn't just own the bad side and God's on the good side and there's the fence.
[2:54:02.760 --> 2:54:04.760]  No, he owns the fence and the bad side.
[2:54:04.760 --> 2:54:06.760]  Get on the side of God.
[2:54:06.760 --> 2:54:10.760]  I promise you, everybody who's listening regardless if you believe or not, he loves you.
[2:54:10.760 --> 2:54:11.760]  He's real.
[2:54:11.760 --> 2:54:13.760]  King Jesus fights for you daily.
[2:54:13.760 --> 2:54:15.760]  He is a propitiation for your sins.
[2:54:15.760 --> 2:54:19.760]  Our founding fathers were not scared of what was to come.
[2:54:19.760 --> 2:54:20.760]  They had the Bible just like we do.
[2:54:20.760 --> 2:54:21.760]  You know what?
[2:54:21.760 --> 2:54:25.760]  I bet that they thought the New World Order that's mentioned in revelations was coming
[2:54:25.760 --> 2:54:27.760]  for them with King George in England.
[2:54:27.760 --> 2:54:32.760]  I bet they knew that England would not stop at just America, that they would try to conquer
[2:54:32.760 --> 2:54:33.760]  the whole world.
[2:54:33.760 --> 2:54:37.760]  So they knew, hmm, maybe we should stand up and fight and fight for the blessings that
[2:54:37.760 --> 2:54:40.760]  God has given us regardless if we lose them or not.
[2:54:40.760 --> 2:54:41.760]  Let's fight for them.
[2:54:41.760 --> 2:54:44.760]  Let's show God who we are and that we love him and that we care.
[2:54:44.760 --> 2:54:48.760]  And I just want to charge everybody who's listening.
[2:54:48.760 --> 2:54:49.760]  Take action, man.
[2:54:49.760 --> 2:54:50.760]  Don't be afraid to share wings.
[2:54:50.760 --> 2:54:51.760]  I totally agree, brother.
[2:54:51.760 --> 2:54:52.760]  And what you're saying is true.
[2:54:52.760 --> 2:54:55.760]  I've never been a devil worshipper when I was a teenager and stuff.
[2:54:55.760 --> 2:54:59.760]  I was on the fence and I could feel the pull of evil on the other side.
[2:54:59.760 --> 2:55:01.760]  It's the worst place to be.
[2:55:01.760 --> 2:55:05.760]  You want to be with God and not be afraid of the devil, not be afraid of the system.
[2:55:05.760 --> 2:55:09.760]  I want the devil to make you ashamed of yourself so you don't want God.
[2:55:09.760 --> 2:55:10.760]  There's a lot of tricks out there.
[2:55:10.760 --> 2:55:13.760]  You want to just cry out to Christ and Christ will answer your prayers.
[2:55:13.760 --> 2:55:15.760]  Man, 100 percent.
[2:55:15.760 --> 2:55:17.760]  He is with you all the way.
[2:55:17.760 --> 2:55:19.760]  Who cares if you look like an idiot?
[2:55:19.760 --> 2:55:21.760]  Who cares if you look like a fool?
[2:55:21.760 --> 2:55:24.760]  Well, the more you don't care what people think, the more you're a leader when you're in the
[2:55:24.760 --> 2:55:25.760]  right place.
[2:55:25.760 --> 2:55:26.760]  Let me tell you.
[2:55:26.760 --> 2:55:27.760]  I mean, Hollywood, all of it's dead.
[2:55:27.760 --> 2:55:28.760]  It's all a joke.
[2:55:28.760 --> 2:55:29.760]  It's all a fraud.
[2:55:29.760 --> 2:55:31.760]  A few more calls and Joe Salinde takes over.
[2:55:31.760 --> 2:55:36.760]  Stay with us.
[2:55:36.760 --> 2:55:42.760]  The bad news is Western governments have totally let multinational big tech bring in communist
[2:55:42.760 --> 2:55:46.760]  Chinese style total net surveillance censorship with AI.
[2:55:46.760 --> 2:55:52.760]  The good news is they had to do that to carry out this world government COVID takeover.
[2:55:52.760 --> 2:55:58.760]  This planetary corporate reset that COVID covers for because the truth is powerful and will
[2:55:58.760 --> 2:56:00.760]  defeat them and will smash them.
[2:56:00.760 --> 2:56:07.760]  And the good news is there's still sites like band.video, newswars.com, infowars.com,
[2:56:07.760 --> 2:56:12.760]  Paul Watson sites, summit.news and a lot of other great sites that are getting massive
[2:56:12.760 --> 2:56:19.760]  traffic thanks to you and your word of mouth that is king, that is queen, that is the master
[2:56:19.760 --> 2:56:21.760]  of our own destinies.
[2:56:21.760 --> 2:56:26.760]  Ladies and gentlemen, there is a war on reality, a war on civilization, a war on our health,
[2:56:26.760 --> 2:56:31.760]  a war on our economy, but being aware of it and standing up to it and speaking out against
[2:56:31.760 --> 2:56:33.760]  it will defeat it.
[2:56:33.760 --> 2:57:02.760]  So take action or be slaves.
[2:57:02.760 --> 2:57:08.760]  I'm not trying to cliffhanger here, but I've got all this coronavirus nose that I need to hit,
[2:57:08.760 --> 2:57:09.760]  but I'm out of time.
[2:57:09.760 --> 2:57:10.760]  I want to take your calls.
[2:57:10.760 --> 2:57:16.760]  But here's the bottom line.
[2:57:16.760 --> 2:57:21.760]  I've looked at this very, very closely and COVID is manmade.
[2:57:21.760 --> 2:57:25.760]  So Gates can patent it and own it with Fauci and the way to bring Fauci down and Gates
[2:57:25.760 --> 2:57:30.760]  down is to expose they were behind the Wulan lab and that they're behind the plan to have
[2:57:30.760 --> 2:57:35.760]  a contact tracing profit and the testing profit and the vaccine profit, which they all own
[2:57:35.760 --> 2:57:37.760]  and control on record.
[2:57:37.760 --> 2:57:43.760]  And now Trump is sidelining him and discrediting him because Fauci won't stop running around
[2:57:43.760 --> 2:57:45.760]  undermining the country.
[2:57:45.760 --> 2:57:49.760]  They're also covering up good treatments and things for all these weird autoimmune diseases
[2:57:49.760 --> 2:57:50.760]  that are out there.
[2:57:50.760 --> 2:57:52.760]  There's a lot of bad demonias.
[2:57:52.760 --> 2:57:53.760]  People are unhealthy.
[2:57:53.760 --> 2:57:55.760]  They're indoors a lot, especially in the winter.
[2:57:55.760 --> 2:57:59.760]  So they're going to take regular pneumonia deaths and put them in a column and there's
[2:57:59.760 --> 2:58:03.760]  a lot of scientists discovered that the one big assumption everybody has been making about
[2:58:03.760 --> 2:58:05.760]  COVID-19 may be dead wrong.
[2:58:05.760 --> 2:58:10.760]  Oh, you never get antibodies or even if you get them, you never get over it because it's
[2:58:10.760 --> 2:58:11.760]  a catch-all.
[2:58:11.760 --> 2:58:12.760]  It's a common cold.
[2:58:12.760 --> 2:58:13.760]  It's made up.
[2:58:13.760 --> 2:58:15.760]  It's something they can't fix.
[2:58:15.760 --> 2:58:20.760]  Scientists say new strain of swine flu virus is spreading to humans in China.
[2:58:20.760 --> 2:58:23.760]  Oh my gosh, we're all dead.
[2:58:23.760 --> 2:58:26.760]  Flu virus with pandemic potential found in China.
[2:58:26.760 --> 2:58:31.760]  EBC, mystery China pneumonia outbreak likely caused by human coronavirus.
[2:58:31.760 --> 2:58:33.760]  But it's the American virus.
[2:58:33.760 --> 2:58:34.760]  It's Trump's fault.
[2:58:34.760 --> 2:58:37.760]  Chinese researchers warn of new pig virus.
[2:58:37.760 --> 2:58:39.760]  They're going to roll out new crap and new fear.
[2:58:39.760 --> 2:58:40.760]  They already are.
[2:58:40.760 --> 2:58:41.760]  We've been predicting it.
[2:58:41.760 --> 2:58:43.760]  Gates even said this is just a beta test.
[2:58:43.760 --> 2:58:44.760]  A bigger, worse one's coming.
[2:58:44.760 --> 2:58:47.760]  We've got their number.
[2:58:47.760 --> 2:58:51.760]  And if they can take over society and have the Clinton Global Initiative run the contact
[2:58:51.760 --> 2:58:55.760]  tracers and get billions and get in our homes and our lives, they'll do it.
[2:58:55.760 --> 2:58:59.760]  They want to get rid of the regular police and the Constitution and bring in unconstitutional
[2:58:59.760 --> 2:59:05.760]  total tyranny separately.
[2:59:05.760 --> 2:59:09.760]  Remember, I told you months and months ago that it's not the COVID virus that's going
[2:59:09.760 --> 2:59:11.760]  to cause hundreds of millions of dead.
[2:59:11.760 --> 2:59:13.760]  It's going to be the lockdown that came from it.
[2:59:13.760 --> 2:59:16.760]  Because when the first world collapses, the third world dies.
[2:59:16.760 --> 2:59:18.760]  Here's the New York Times.
[2:59:18.760 --> 2:59:22.760]  Instead of coronavirus, the hunger will kill us at Global Food Crisis Looms.
[2:59:22.760 --> 2:59:26.760]  But the UN, the same group, will now save us from it.
[2:59:26.760 --> 2:59:28.760]  Coronavirus crisis could double the number of people suffering.
[2:59:28.760 --> 2:59:31.760]  Acute hunger, UN, already is.
[2:59:31.760 --> 2:59:32.760]  Months later, it's true.
[2:59:32.760 --> 2:59:35.760]  Coronavirus pandemic will cause famine of biblical proportions.
[2:59:35.760 --> 2:59:38.760]  But the UN's answer is give us more money.
[2:59:38.760 --> 2:59:43.760]  The UN warns 10 million face acute food shortages just in Yemen.
[2:59:43.760 --> 2:59:45.760]  The media is like, COVID did it.
[2:59:45.760 --> 2:59:49.760]  No, the panic, the lockdown did it all over the world.
[2:59:49.760 --> 2:59:53.760]  But now, U.S. could face food shortages.
[2:59:53.760 --> 2:59:57.760]  Food prices are already going up because of the panic and the shutting down where, oh, everybody has this.
[2:59:57.760 --> 3:00:01.760]  We have to shut down the meatpacking plant, but nobody is sick.
[3:00:01.760 --> 3:00:03.760]  It's here.
[3:00:03.760 --> 3:00:07.760]  GOP rep warns USA weeks away from food shortages.
[3:00:07.760 --> 3:00:10.760]  And now we see it beginning to happen.
[3:00:10.760 --> 3:00:12.760]  So this has been going on for months.
[3:00:12.760 --> 3:00:14.760]  It's now compounding.
[3:00:14.760 --> 3:00:16.760]  And it'll be an inconvenience here.
[3:00:16.760 --> 3:00:19.760]  It'll be a death sentence in the third world.
[3:00:19.760 --> 3:00:21.760]  And it's absolutely disgusting.
[3:00:21.760 --> 3:00:24.760]  And it never needed to happen.
[3:00:24.760 --> 3:00:26.760]  So we told you this months ago.
[3:00:26.760 --> 3:00:28.760]  Told you this four months ago, five months ago.
[3:00:28.760 --> 3:00:32.760]  American meat producers must leverage their technology to protect consumers, workers.
[3:00:32.760 --> 3:00:33.760]  Oh, they've got to scan everybody.
[3:00:33.760 --> 3:00:36.760]  They've got to be in the AI to prove they're not bad.
[3:00:36.760 --> 3:00:38.760]  This is just an AI takeover.
[3:00:38.760 --> 3:00:39.760]  This is just big tech.
[3:00:39.760 --> 3:00:45.760]  It's all announcing record profits while nobody else is flexing their muscles and taking over the whole society.
[3:00:45.760 --> 3:00:47.760]  But Josh Hawley is right.
[3:00:47.760 --> 3:00:48.760]  The senator is right.
[3:00:48.760 --> 3:00:55.760]  Great idea to subpoena NBA commissioner is close ties with China.
[3:00:55.760 --> 3:00:58.760]  Look, Mike, Mike and Simon, I want to really go to you guys.
[3:00:58.760 --> 3:00:59.760]  I got to about 20 calls.
[3:00:59.760 --> 3:01:00.760]  I'm out of time.
[3:01:00.760 --> 3:01:02.760]  We're trying to let these taking over.
[3:01:02.760 --> 3:01:03.760]  I'm just going to say this.
[3:01:03.760 --> 3:01:05.760]  This is the last day of the big sale.
[3:01:05.760 --> 3:01:07.760]  So I'm free shipping double patriot points.
[3:01:07.760 --> 3:01:09.760]  And you heard about the food.
[3:01:09.760 --> 3:01:11.760]  We were six to eight weeks to get the food.
[3:01:11.760 --> 3:01:12.760]  Everybody got it.
[3:01:12.760 --> 3:01:13.760]  It's high quality.
[3:01:13.760 --> 3:01:14.760]  Now it's three to four.
[3:01:14.760 --> 3:01:15.760]  The package that ship it.
[3:01:15.760 --> 3:01:17.760]  The packaging is the best you're going to find anywhere.
[3:01:17.760 --> 3:01:18.760]  That means it lasts a long time.
[3:01:18.760 --> 3:01:19.760]  It's high quality.
[3:01:19.760 --> 3:01:24.760]  And before this real storm comes, believe me, this, I believe is the calm.
[3:01:24.760 --> 3:01:26.760]  And I wish it wasn't going that direction.
[3:01:26.760 --> 3:01:29.760]  When things are just going to get crazy right now, you need high quality, swarable food.
[3:01:29.760 --> 3:01:30.760]  You need to get a garden going.
[3:01:30.760 --> 3:01:31.760]  You need a firearm.
[3:01:31.760 --> 3:01:32.760]  You need to have a plan.
[3:01:32.760 --> 3:01:38.760]  And infoworkstore.com is a great place to get your water filtration, air filtration and swarable food and infoworkstore.com.
[3:01:38.760 --> 3:01:41.760]  So I would take action now while you still can.
[3:01:41.760 --> 3:01:48.760]  All right, Gerald Salente trends forecaster publisher of the great trends journal is here to cover the waterfront.
[3:01:48.760 --> 3:01:51.760]  He's got a lot to break down and a lot to go over.
[3:01:51.760 --> 3:01:53.760]  And so he joins us right now.
[3:01:53.760 --> 3:01:57.760]  Follow him obviously on Twitter at Gerald Salente.
[3:01:57.760 --> 3:01:58.760]  All right, Gerald.
[3:01:58.760 --> 3:01:59.760]  Thanks for being here.
[3:01:59.760 --> 3:02:00.760]  We love you.
[3:02:00.760 --> 3:02:01.760]  Thanks for having me on.
[3:02:01.760 --> 3:02:03.760]  And thank you for all that you do.
[3:02:03.760 --> 3:02:10.760]  And everyone listening out there, put your money where your mind and heart is and do what you can to support info wars.
[3:02:10.760 --> 3:02:16.760]  Because all we're getting day after day is propaganda and the media.
[3:02:16.760 --> 3:02:25.760]  As we pointed out from the very beginning of this COVID outbreak, you look at our January 28th trends journal cover.
[3:02:25.760 --> 3:02:31.760]  They hyped us to their ratings were in the toilet like the prostitutes hang out in the toilet.
[3:02:31.760 --> 3:02:33.760]  That's where their numbers were.
[3:02:33.760 --> 3:02:42.760]  And our cover read coronavirus 106 dead in China and our line was 1.4 billion still alive.
[3:02:42.760 --> 3:02:50.760]  And what are you telling us this stuff for these numbers don't add up to a pandemic that they're claiming that we have.
[3:02:50.760 --> 3:02:53.760]  There's been many much worse than this.
[3:02:53.760 --> 3:03:03.760]  I have some articles here from a number of papers, including the toilet paper record the New York Times.
[3:03:03.760 --> 3:03:14.760]  And they did this whole big piece on Cuomo and how he locked down the actually didn't lock down.
[3:03:14.760 --> 3:03:26.760]  He sent patients to nursing homes from excuse me from hospitals that COVID into nursing homes.
[3:03:26.760 --> 3:03:37.760]  And he said the New York Times goes on to write those deaths accounted for about 40% in total.
[3:03:37.760 --> 3:03:43.760]  The nursing home deaths 40% of all coronavirus deaths in the country.
[3:03:43.760 --> 3:03:58.760]  Okay, 40% of all coronavirus deaths from the country are from nursing homes and murderer Cuomo sent sick people out of hospitals into nursing homes.
[3:03:58.760 --> 3:04:14.760]  And he also said here the State Department of Health order on March 25 said that nursing homes must readmit residents sent to hospitals with the coronavirus.
[3:04:14.760 --> 3:04:24.760]  I'm not making this up and accept new patients as long as they are deemed quote medically stable.
[3:04:24.760 --> 3:04:25.760]  You ready for this?
[3:04:25.760 --> 3:04:34.760]  The nursing homes were also barred from testing new or returning residents for the coronavirus.
[3:04:34.760 --> 3:04:38.760]  They literally incubated on purpose mass murder.
[3:04:38.760 --> 3:04:39.760]  Mass murder.
[3:04:39.760 --> 3:04:44.760]  Now Alex what's important about this and this is what we've been saying.
[3:04:44.760 --> 3:04:54.760]  Even the toilet paper record the New York Times is saying 40% of the deaths in the United States are from nursing homes.
[3:04:54.760 --> 3:04:59.760]  The average age is over 70 years old.
[3:04:59.760 --> 3:05:18.760]  The other people again they go on to state here which we've stated in the trends journal that it's difficult to do state by state comparisons about nursing home cases or deaths because reporting requirements very widely.
[3:05:18.760 --> 3:05:24.760]  Some states report no cases or deaths at all.
[3:05:24.760 --> 3:05:37.760]  The federal government published some data but it did not require nursing homes to report cases or deaths that occurred before May.
[3:05:37.760 --> 3:05:40.760]  That occurred before May.
[3:05:40.760 --> 3:05:48.760]  Hey, didn't most of the people die before May? That's when the numbers was spiking.
[3:05:48.760 --> 3:05:51.760]  So it's way above 40%.
[3:05:51.760 --> 3:05:56.760]  It's more like the Western average of 50%.
[3:05:56.760 --> 3:05:59.760]  And who are the rest of the people?
[3:05:59.760 --> 3:06:10.760]  Well, you know who they are. They're diabetics and they're people suffering from type 2 diabetes.
[3:06:10.760 --> 3:06:19.760]  Those are the people that are dying and they closed down an entire global economy in the United States economy.
[3:06:19.760 --> 3:06:34.760]  More people will be killed by the politicians COVID war that's going to destroy the lives of many and you're going to see violent crime rise to levels that'll be off the charts.
[3:06:34.760 --> 3:06:51.760]  We'll be right back.
[3:06:51.760 --> 3:07:06.760]  It's the end of the world as we know it and I don't feel fun. This entire takeover has been battle-punned, blueprinted, war-gamed, field-martialed by the psychological war chiefs at the United Nations and the Fortune 100.
[3:07:06.760 --> 3:07:13.760]  This is the post-human takeover. The news gets tighter when you comply, not looser.
[3:07:13.760 --> 3:07:22.760]  The entire COVID-19 operation is a hoax. Now they admit the quote death numbers are dropping because those are fake where they count people that died of something else.
[3:07:22.760 --> 3:07:30.760]  But it's all about how many cases there are and now they're saying most of the population will get it and then no one can go outside ever again.
[3:07:30.760 --> 3:07:35.760]  It's totally insane. It's a fraud. It's all a lie.
[3:07:35.760 --> 3:07:43.760]  One of our best-selling products is Living Defense and it's been sold out for over four months because it's hard to source the ingredients that are organic.
[3:07:43.760 --> 3:07:49.760]  We've got a limited supply right now but it's selling out fast and I want those of you that haven't experienced Living Defense to get it for yourself.
[3:07:49.760 --> 3:07:51.760]  Here's just part of one testimonial.
[3:07:51.760 --> 3:08:06.760]  In January 2016, I went in the VA hospital out here in Boise and I was in there until June and one of the only things that got me through that ordeal was listening to Info Wars three hours a day and I kept hearing Dr. Group and all you guys talking about Living Defense.
[3:08:06.760 --> 3:08:14.760]  Let me tell you something, man. I had an internal digestive problem and I suffered with it for about five or six years and the doctors, they tried every test.
[3:08:14.760 --> 3:08:21.760]  Nobody could figure out what it is and then every day when I kept hearing you and Dr. Group and those commercials, I said, you know what? I'm going to get me some of that freaking Living Defense.
[3:08:21.760 --> 3:08:28.760]  Now, I wasn't supposed to have any nutritionals because they don't want you to have that stuff but I ordered it, had it shipped to me, I got it, I hid it from the nurses.
[3:08:28.760 --> 3:08:46.760]  I started taking it, man. That stuff changed my life. It saved my life. Alex Jones and Info Wars saved my life.
[3:08:59.760 --> 3:09:07.760]  And I normally sit here on Mondays when he hosted and had my lunch late and I know he likes it when I jump in so that's why I'm doing it.
[3:09:07.760 --> 3:09:14.760]  And he's talking about the same subject I was talking about so I'm here. There's a new article on InfoWars.com. We'll put it on screen.
[3:09:14.760 --> 3:09:25.760]  Cuomo unveils this bizarre mural where he's a hero and trumps a man in the moon that did nothing and then you scroll down, he's calling himself a hero.
[3:09:25.760 --> 3:09:34.760]  Gerald, I'm going to get out of here and let you finish up and cover this but clearly it's premeditated to send sick people to nursing homes
[3:09:34.760 --> 3:09:40.760]  and then say the families can't come though because they might be sick but you can't test anybody else and we want to bring sick people there.
[3:09:40.760 --> 3:09:44.760]  We're going to bring sick people there but families can't see them.
[3:09:44.760 --> 3:09:55.760]  They wanted death numbers to be higher. They wanted to innovate them and get the extra $30,000 to get plus the $15,000. It's about money. It's a $52,000 bounty on each of their heads.
[3:09:55.760 --> 3:10:04.760]  Do you disagree with me on that and then if you agree what needs to happen to these criminals will put the bizarre map up there with devils and Trump and everything?
[3:10:04.760 --> 3:10:22.760]  Well, they're doing it for political reasons. There's no question about it. Look what just happened in New York City when you had that other piece of garbage, Bill de Blasio painting Black Lives Matter in front of Trump Towers and making a big deal out of it.
[3:10:22.760 --> 3:10:30.760]  And it says on the thing, COVID came from Europe. It says Europe is the blame. Then it says New York State leads again. This is crazy.
[3:10:30.760 --> 3:10:39.760]  These are crazy people. That's why they're doing it. These are mentally ill people. I'll tell you a quick Cuomo story.
[3:10:39.760 --> 3:10:47.760]  A friend of mine used to, was the photographer at the embassy in Beijing, China.
[3:10:47.760 --> 3:11:04.760]  And this is going back a number of years ago when Cuomo was the head of Health and Human Services under Clinton. And my buddy is a Scottish guy and in perfect Scottish accent, he said,
[3:11:04.760 --> 3:11:21.760]  You would think the privileged prince arrived. Cuomo was so arrogant the way he was bossing people around and his attitude. That's who he is. He's an arrogant little boy born on third base and thought he had a home run.
[3:11:21.760 --> 3:11:36.760]  Would be nobody if daddy wasn't Mario, like his little brother over there on the Cartoon News Network. The arrogance of these people are so high that this jerk, this little low life piece of crap,
[3:11:36.760 --> 3:11:47.760]  renamed the Tappan Z bridge, the Mario Cuomo bridge after his father. Hey, little boy, what do you think your father's better than mine?
[3:11:47.760 --> 3:11:59.760]  Your father's a politician. Take it easy. Oh, no, so lengthy. We're going to take your tax money to change the name all over the place so that we could put my daddy's name up there.
[3:11:59.760 --> 3:12:16.760]  That's what you're dealing with. You're dealing with little sick minded people who are power hungry freaks that will do anything, anything to get power.
[3:12:16.760 --> 3:12:22.760]  What do you expect? What do you expect is coming next? I mean, you pause. What do you think is coming next from these maniacs?
[3:12:22.760 --> 3:12:32.760]  Oh, they're going to do anything they can to destroy Trump. And to me, Trump's playing the wrong card. All Trump should be doing is playing the same card over and over again.
[3:12:32.760 --> 3:12:47.760]  And you can tell him you came from so lengthy if you haven't heard it before. He should be out there day after day saying that the Democrats have destroyed the economy.
[3:12:47.760 --> 3:12:52.760]  You're out of business. You're out of work because they locked down the place.
[3:12:52.760 --> 3:12:59.760]  I totally agree. Instead of trying to prop it up when they're trying to destroy it, put it on them. They'll shut up real fast and stop it.
[3:12:59.760 --> 3:13:09.760]  You got it, especially in the swing states. Hey, and especially in Jersey, not New York. He's never going to get New York.
[3:13:09.760 --> 3:13:16.760]  But if he won't do it, we're doing it right now and the listeners need to, absolutely, the way for Trump to win is to expose the Democrats, destruction of the economy.
[3:13:16.760 --> 3:13:18.760]  He must go on the offense.
[3:13:18.760 --> 3:13:28.760]  Exactly. In every swing state, and even the ones that aren't like a New Jersey, you got this little piece of crap.
[3:13:28.760 --> 3:13:35.760]  Murphy, whatever the hell his name is, making up laws every day. They're making this crap up.
[3:13:35.760 --> 3:13:44.760]  You know, I had Judge Napolitano up here last week when we had the Fourth of July rally and he was talking about this is unconstitutional.
[3:13:44.760 --> 3:13:50.760]  It's against the Bill of Rights. You're not allowed to make these executive orders.
[3:13:50.760 --> 3:14:02.760]  They are destroying the right across the streets of New York's place. Duos in business eight years, great restaurant, wonderful people and a business for rent signs up and down the streets.
[3:14:02.760 --> 3:14:04.760]  This place was packed.
[3:14:04.760 --> 3:14:13.760]  So by the way, you bet on Kingston moved everything when it was down and then you as you predicted it became a boom town and now you're watching them flush it down the toilet.
[3:14:13.760 --> 3:14:20.760]  Yes. And again, the prostitutes did this to boost their ratings. The facts are there.
[3:14:20.760 --> 3:14:34.760]  We quoted that guy, Zucker, or is it with an F that runs CNN in our trends journal quoting him from the Wall Street Journal, him telling his staff to stay on the COVID.
[3:14:34.760 --> 3:14:36.760]  More people were tuning in.
[3:14:36.760 --> 3:14:46.760]  Their ratings are in the crapper. They were way down. Go back to January. Go back to February.
[3:14:46.760 --> 3:14:52.760]  They were tanking. Nobody was tuning in listening to another little boy born on third base.
[3:14:52.760 --> 3:14:58.760]  Anderson Cooper, mommy was Gloria Vanderbilt. Got it.
[3:14:58.760 --> 3:15:06.760]  That's what they did. They boosted their ratings just like they boost their ratings when they put on all that hurricane drag.
[3:15:06.760 --> 3:15:09.760]  Oh, our hurricanes coming. Our hurricanes coming.
[3:15:09.760 --> 3:15:16.760]  They sell fear. That's their major item that they sell. And that's what sick politicians do.
[3:15:16.760 --> 3:15:28.760]  Kyle Hitler, March to Mussolini. Salute Stalin. They sell fear and the stupid people buy it. You should. I don't have to tell you.
[3:15:28.760 --> 3:15:33.760]  You should see the crap that I'm getting for holding that rally.
[3:15:33.760 --> 3:15:40.760]  Yet on Saturday, I'm walking down the street and a woman gives me one of these for holding the rally.
[3:15:40.760 --> 3:15:49.760]  I went one of these and she called me a name that starts with a D, ends with a K, and has an I and C in the middle of it.
[3:15:49.760 --> 3:15:56.760]  Salenty, you. But I said, don't you call me that name. That's sexist.
[3:15:56.760 --> 3:16:01.760]  All right. That's what's going on. The people are little cowards.
[3:16:01.760 --> 3:16:08.760]  It's these gutless little cowards that are destroying this place. And that's what Trump should be saying.
[3:16:08.760 --> 3:16:15.760]  They destroyed Pennsylvania. They destroyed Michigan. They destroyed one state after another.
[3:16:15.760 --> 3:16:19.760]  And they're not coming back. They're not coming back.
[3:16:19.760 --> 3:16:29.760]  Even Yelp is saying what we've been saying since this broke out that 53% of the restaurants aren't going to reopen.
[3:16:29.760 --> 3:16:36.760]  Who else is dying? The people that again, diabetics, lung disease.
[3:16:36.760 --> 3:16:44.760]  You're kidding. Oh, you're a diabetic and you're and excuse me, you're you're obese and you're dying from this.
[3:16:44.760 --> 3:16:49.760]  Guess what? You're going to die from something anyway.
[3:16:49.760 --> 3:16:54.760]  And again, who are the other people smoking cigarettes, chronically ill people before?
[3:16:54.760 --> 3:17:03.760]  The reason why the cases are going up is because crazy people are getting tested like crazy.
[3:17:03.760 --> 3:17:08.760]  No, that's where we're at. And this thing's going to go down hard.
[3:17:08.760 --> 3:17:15.760]  Trump needs to call them out. They kill the economy. He wanted to keep it open.
[3:17:15.760 --> 3:17:21.760]  They kill the economy. He wanted to keep it open. The numbers add up to nothing.
[3:17:21.760 --> 3:17:28.760]  They add up to nothing compared to the other deaths, the other viruses and the other illnesses.
[3:17:28.760 --> 3:17:34.760]  So again, do what you can to support info was keep the truth alive.
[3:17:59.760 --> 3:18:08.760]  It supports healthy nerve and brain cells, helps make DNA, help the body produce more energy,
[3:18:08.760 --> 3:18:13.760]  help produce healthy blood cells essential for proper nervous system function and so much more.
[3:18:13.760 --> 3:18:20.760]  You can take all the energy drinks and they won't do anything if you don't have the basics already in your body like vitamin B12.
[3:18:20.760 --> 3:18:26.760]  Whether you're old, whether you're young, whether you're black, whether you're white, whether you live in Japan or the United States,
[3:18:26.760 --> 3:18:29.760]  if you're older 12 is the best vitamin B12 you're going to find out there.

[3:19:51.760 --> 3:19:54.760]  We just think that's how the rest of the world is.
[3:19:54.760 --> 3:20:01.760]  Ladies and gentlemen, the renaissance, the social contract that's 500 years old to try to build up humanity and try to believe in humanity
[3:20:01.760 --> 3:20:08.760]  and to try to empower the weak as well as the strong is something the West invented and that's what made our modern world.
[3:20:08.760 --> 3:20:16.760]  That's now been hijacked by the technocrats, by the globalists who say humans are ugly and bad for the earth and we need to be cold and dumbed down
[3:20:16.760 --> 3:20:23.760]  and put into subgroups that the elites dominate, manipulate and command if you're even lucky enough to stay alive.
[3:20:23.760 --> 3:20:31.760]  And that's what COVID-19 is, a global UN revolution against free humanity, against your family, against prosperity and against your future.
[3:20:31.760 --> 3:20:46.760]  If you don't stand up and fight, you deserve what you get.
[3:21:01.760 --> 3:21:05.760]  Post Gerald Solente
[3:21:05.760 --> 3:21:19.760]  Uh, great, great being on the Alex Jones show. Love being here and thank you Alex Jones and all the staff for all that you do to keep truth alive at this very time when we're losing it so quickly.
[3:21:19.760 --> 3:21:38.760]  A great divide has happened. This nation is so divided. The COVID war that the politicians started is going to bring an economic crash and violence like we've never seen before.
[3:21:38.760 --> 3:21:54.760]  And we had this rally in Kingston. They showed some of the photos. It was unite for peace and restore freedom. And we invited Black Lives Matter, but that didn't matter to them.
[3:21:54.760 --> 3:22:03.760]  We asked them to have the platform because we all wanted to unite. They wouldn't come because Judge Napolitano was there and he's on Fox.
[3:22:03.760 --> 3:22:16.760]  And they wouldn't come because I'm on Alex Jones. They forget that Napolitano is a judge, former judge, and he's a libertarian. They don't have any clue.
[3:22:16.760 --> 3:22:29.760]  And they forget, but don't care that I also host an hour on progressive radio networking every other Wednesday. So those facts don't matter. So they didn't come.
[3:22:29.760 --> 3:22:40.760]  And the divide is so harsh. Here's another article from the toilet paper record. You saw I underlined the salient points of stories. I read this stuff.
[3:22:40.760 --> 3:22:54.760]  Newspapers, one of the old timers that keeps reading them. Experts feel torn on dangers of different protests. This is from Saturday.
[3:22:54.760 --> 3:23:02.760]  As the pandemic took hold, most epidemiologists had clear prescriptions in fighting it.
[3:23:02.760 --> 3:23:12.760]  No students in classrooms, no in-person religious services, no visits to sick relatives and hospitals, no large public gatherings.
[3:23:12.760 --> 3:23:34.760]  So when conservative anti-lockdown protesters gathered in the state capitol in places like Columbus, Ohio, in Lansing, Michigan in April and May, epidemiologists scolded them and forecast surging infections.
[3:23:34.760 --> 3:23:42.760]  This is an example of propaganda when conservative anti-lockdown protesters.
[3:23:42.760 --> 3:24:00.760]  I'm an anti-lockdown protester in Bissell, Michael Powell, your little low-life piece of propaganda crap from the toilet paper of record.
[3:24:00.760 --> 3:24:21.760]  It goes on to say, when Governor Brian Kemp of Georgia relaxed restrictions on businesses in late April as testing lagged and infections rose, the talk in public health circles was that states embrace of human sacrifice.
[3:24:21.760 --> 3:24:40.760]  And then the killing of George Floyd by the police in Minneapolis on May 25th changed everything. Soon the streets of tens of thousands of people in mass protest movements that continue to this day with demonstrations and the toppling of statues.
[3:24:40.760 --> 3:24:56.760]  And rather than decrying mass gatherings, more than 1,300 public health officials signed a letter of support and many joined the protests.
[3:24:56.760 --> 3:25:11.760]  That's how hypocritical these low-life, slimy pieces of crap are that call themselves health officials.
[3:25:11.760 --> 3:25:26.760]  And it goes on to say, the reaction and the contrast with the epidemiologists early fervent support for the lockdown gave rise to an uncomfortable question.
[3:25:26.760 --> 3:25:41.760]  Was public health advice in a pandemic dependent on whether people approved of the mass gatherings in question? To many, the answer seemed to be yes. The answer is yes.
[3:25:41.760 --> 3:26:00.760]  They go on to say, Catherine Trioci, an infectious disease epidemiologist at the University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston, yeah, down in Texas, down in your land down there.
[3:26:00.760 --> 3:26:16.760]  Studies COVID-19. When wearing a mask and standing at the edge of a great swell of people, she attended a recent protest in Houston, supporting Mr. Floyd, a sense of contradiction tugged at her, quote,
[3:26:16.760 --> 3:26:34.760]  I certainly condemn the anti-lockdown protests at the time, and I'm not condemning the protest now. And I struggle with that, she said. I have a hard time articulating why that is okay.
[3:26:34.760 --> 3:26:49.760]  Hey, Miss Trioci, how about calling yourself an arrogant hypocrite? Does that fit? You condemn one and you don't condemn the other because you believe in one and don't believe in the other.
[3:26:49.760 --> 3:27:07.760]  And that's what this nation has become. A nation ruled by hypocrites, disgusting health official hypocrites that ignore the facts and bow down and suck up to what they like and condemn us for not sucking up and bowing down
[3:27:07.760 --> 3:27:17.760]  and swallowing the crap that they feed out. You are a hypocrite. And we got more.
[3:27:17.760 --> 3:27:40.760]  Mark Lawrie, professor of epidemiology at Brown University, described a similar struggle. Isn't that nice language? Describe the similar struggle. You rotten, slimy hypocrites, come to me, we will talk man to man and woman to woman.
[3:27:40.760 --> 3:27:53.760]  He goes on to say, instinctively, many of us in public health feel a strong desire to act against accumulated generations of racial injustice.
[3:27:53.760 --> 3:28:15.760]  Professor Lawrie, professor this, screw your bullshit, your bull crap lines of professor and doctor and epidemiologist. Let's call it human beings of which you people have descended below.
[3:28:15.760 --> 3:28:32.760]  He goes on to say, but we have to be honest. A few weeks before, we were criticizing protesters for arguing to open up the economy and saying that it was dangerous behavior.
[3:28:32.760 --> 3:28:53.760]  I'm still grappling with that. Grapple on this. Grappling with you being a hypocrite like all the rest. Yes, social injustice. I am sick and tired of people calling America a racist nation.
[3:28:53.760 --> 3:29:04.760]  Are there racists? Of course there are. Are there anti-Semites? Of course there are. Are there people that hate Italians? Of course there are.
[3:29:04.760 --> 3:29:26.760]  America is not a racist nation, little boys and girls that call yourself professor. Maybe you're too ignorant or cowardly to remember a name called Barack Obama, a black man that was elected president in the United States.
[3:29:26.760 --> 3:29:45.760]  If it's a racist nation, Junior, you don't elect a black president. Oh, and how about that other murderer? Oh, Colin Powell. Yeah, going down the crap Powell that sold us the Iraq war with his little vial of crap.
[3:29:45.760 --> 3:29:54.760]  Down the colon. Oh, he was black too. Hey, Condoleezza Rice, she loved war too. How about Susan Rice? Stop with this.
[3:29:54.760 --> 3:30:10.760]  Good bad comes in all racist creeds and colors. But you hypocrites are cowards. You won't admit to the truth.
[3:30:10.760 --> 3:30:26.760]  COVID is hype, fear and hysteria that has destroyed this nation. It's not coming back. The greatest oppression has begun. When you talk about those products that they're selling on info wars, you better prepare.
[3:30:26.760 --> 3:30:33.760]  And we're going to have more articles in the Trends Journal about preparing, and you better stay tuned for more information.
[3:30:33.760 --> 3:30:50.760]  Do you believe in evolution in the modern theory or not? The globalist controllers do. They constantly write about and talk about how they want to create a global crisis or a group of crises that force humans to, quote, evolve in a new, better way.
[3:30:50.760 --> 3:31:01.760]  If you study how they actually want you to evolve, you believe in that. It is to stop having children emerge with silicon bodies and a post human future. Talk about psychotic. Talk about creepy. Talk about crazy.
[3:31:01.760 --> 3:31:18.760]  But they need an event like COVID-19 to teach a mammal to wear some covering over its nose, over its breathing tubes to set the precedent for the forced inoculations for the GMO for the 5G and for all the things that they admit will end our humanity as we know it.
[3:31:18.760 --> 3:31:33.760]  That's why this is so evil. Their whole agenda for cashless society, global government, UN control, getting us all into debt, getting rid of local government, think about all the facets of the censorship, the surveillance.
[3:31:33.760 --> 3:31:54.760]  A lot of you have been listening for more than 20 years and if you go back to those shows, we laid out the AI takeover plan, the tracking of cell phones, how programmed master computers would manipulate control society, how they'd be able to not just predict large groups of human movements and activities, but even predict what individuals would do.
[3:31:54.760 --> 3:32:09.760]  And then once you can predict what individuals were going to be doing, you can add stimuli through the AI systems, through the computers, through digital billboards, through face scanning, through the social credit score to control people and make them act like you wanted to.
[3:32:09.760 --> 3:32:18.760]  But when we cover that, the media would attack us and say we were making it up. It was a conspiracy theory, even though it was in the actual corporate level blueprint documents.
[3:32:18.760 --> 3:32:26.760]  Well, the next level of the blueprint documents explained to us that they are setting up this control system to make humans obsolete and phase us out.
[3:32:26.760 --> 3:32:33.760]  And it's something about a thousand times crazier than what Hitler planned. So we might want to dismantle the system now.
[3:32:33.760 --> 3:32:48.760]  As the years go by, it gets harder and harder to keep up with your body's nutritional needs. With changes in diet, unnatural ingredients and stress, you may not be able to get all the necessary nutrients, amino acids, vitamins and minerals needed daily.
[3:32:48.760 --> 3:33:04.760]  That's why Infowars Life created the powerful Vitamin Mineral Fusion Formula, the new platinum standard of advanced multivitamin formulation.

[3:34:04.760 --> 3:34:22.760]  Folks know I was in some movies and Harry Shearer made statements like that and a lot of others. I'm not bragging. I kept explaining to them, I said, do you understand I didn't come up with any of this? I'm reading globalist MIT white papers and futurist documents and they would just laugh at me and say, oh, no way.
[3:34:22.760 --> 3:34:34.760]  They would give them the documents, they would get very, very scared the next time I saw them in a few months and say, man, you're right, this is dystopic. Folks, I didn't make any of this up. Okay, it's real, it's real.
[3:34:53.760 --> 3:35:01.760]  Waging war on corruption, it's Gerald Salente. You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[3:35:01.760 --> 3:35:22.760]  Great being on the Alex Jones show and it's an honor to be here. And I appreciate everything that Alex Jones in Infowars does to keep the truth alive.

[3:37:06.760 --> 3:37:27.760]  Unimaginable in modern history here. Wall Street Journal. Major cities see violent crime soar. What date is this. Oh Monday, July 13.
[3:37:27.760 --> 3:37:37.760]  Well, blow me away. We only said this would happen when they started locking down all the cities and all the states.
[3:37:37.760 --> 3:37:49.760]  Again, this is what Trump should be talking about. This is why violent crime is rising. You've heard me say it before. When people lose everything and have nothing left to lose, they lose it.
[3:37:49.760 --> 3:38:01.760]  They're losing it. This is from the top to the bottom. It's going to be New York City is a shadow of what it is used to be.
[3:38:01.760 --> 3:38:19.760]  And I'm in New York. I know the place is going on this guy getting stabbed. He's a fighter. It's violent crime.
[3:38:19.760 --> 3:38:33.760]  He's not a close combat cat man. That guy be dead if he was after me. And we're going to be writing more about close combat in the trends journal each article.
[3:38:33.760 --> 3:38:43.760]  We have Brad Steiner, one of the top of the top doing the articles for us. He was a teacher of my teacher, John Perkins attack proof dot com.
[3:38:43.760 --> 3:38:59.760]  And John Perkins, other than my parents made us all rest in peace. He changed my life more than anybody. I'm a little guy, you know, five feet, six and a half inches, you know, hundred and twenty something pounds.
[3:38:59.760 --> 3:39:07.760]  You mess with me. I'll kill you. So that's why I speak out the way I do. If I have to fight for my life, I will.
[3:39:07.760 --> 3:39:19.760]  If I have to fight for freedom, I'm not a coward. So when I talk about these foods and these super sales at InfoWords, you better start stocking up.
[3:39:19.760 --> 3:39:31.760]  This thing, we're going to be living hell on earth if we don't reverse this. It's going to be hell on earth. You saw that subway car was empty, empty.
[3:39:31.760 --> 3:39:46.760]  It's going to sit down like the 50 year loads. New York City boarded up loads of places. One joint going out of business after another.
[3:39:46.760 --> 3:39:57.760]  This is going to be terrible if we don't reverse this trend. I will put my trend forecasting track record up against anyone on earth.
[3:39:57.760 --> 3:40:06.760]  I say that in a bragging manner. I say it the same way Muhammad Ali would say, I'm number one. You show me the books you've written.
[3:40:06.760 --> 3:40:15.760]  You show me the magazines you've been writing. The magazine, what, since 1991? I've been at this since 1980.
[3:40:15.760 --> 3:40:24.760]  Show me a track record and then we could start talking. The future that I see is going to be hell on earth if we don't reverse it.
[3:40:24.760 --> 3:40:39.760]  This is a time to unite, not separate. Yes, black lives matter. Terrible things are happening. Terrible things are happening across the board.
[3:40:39.760 --> 3:40:56.760]  It's a time to unite. United we stand divided we fall. And I'm a warrior of the Prince of Peace. People say, you call yourself a warrior and you want to occupy peace.
[3:40:56.760 --> 3:41:05.760]  And you said you'd kill somebody if you bet I would. I'm not here to be taken out by anybody.
[3:41:05.760 --> 3:41:13.760]  One thing has nothing to do with the other. And as a fighter, you know, the last thing you want to do is fight.
[3:41:13.760 --> 3:41:24.760]  And the last thing you want to do is get killed by somebody like that crazy guy with that knife.
[3:41:24.760 --> 3:41:31.760]  I would have killed that guy. That guy came at me with that knife like that. I would have killed him unquestionably.
[3:41:31.760 --> 3:41:38.760]  And that's the other thing you learn in close combat. Matter of fact, I was taught that as a little boy growing up in the Bronx.
[3:41:38.760 --> 3:41:50.760]  Learn how to fight as a kid. That's right. My father may rest in peace used to say to me, when you're getting a fight, son, show them no quarters.
[3:41:50.760 --> 3:42:01.760]  That means you finish them off. If it gets into a fight and it's that ugly, you better end it. And you end it when the cat is moving.
[3:42:01.760 --> 3:42:11.760]  And John Perkins taught us that too. Yeah, when the spirit leaves their body, then the fight's over.
[3:42:11.760 --> 3:42:17.760]  And as a Russian guy, just when they re-opened Russia was there, you don't mess with the Russians, man.
[3:42:17.760 --> 3:42:26.760]  This guy said to Perkins, what's this spirit you talk about? Yeah, that's the fight.
[3:42:26.760 --> 3:42:40.760]  And we're in a fight. That article, that experts feel torn on dangers of different protests, not torn, they're hypocrites.
[3:42:40.760 --> 3:42:54.760]  Here we go. As public health advocates and the scientists and health workers stated, quote, we do not condemn these gatherings as risky for COVID-19 transmission.
[3:42:54.760 --> 3:43:00.760]  We support them as vital to the national public health.
[3:43:00.760 --> 3:43:10.760]  This is a letter signed by over 1300 epidemiologists and health workers in America.
[3:43:10.760 --> 3:43:17.760]  They're total hypocrites, total, total hypocrites.
[3:43:17.760 --> 3:43:25.760]  So the COVID facts and the mainstream fantasy are two different things.
[3:43:25.760 --> 3:43:32.760]  What's going on in the equity markets, by the way, has nothing to do with reality. You know, they're totally rigged.
[3:43:32.760 --> 3:43:39.760]  Gregory Manorino's writing with us now is putting out good information as well to boost what we've been saying.
[3:43:39.760 --> 3:43:45.760]  As people that know that I've been on info with for many years, I was bearish on gold.
[3:43:45.760 --> 3:43:56.760]  And a year ago, a little over a year and a month ago, our trend alert was the gold bull run began. Gold was $1,332 an ounce.
[3:43:56.760 --> 3:44:02.760]  Today, it's over $1,800 an ounce.
[3:44:02.760 --> 3:44:09.760]  You'd think you would have paid for your subscription to Trends Journal by buying a tiny bit of gold.
[3:44:09.760 --> 3:44:15.760]  Gold breaks over 2,000 an ounce. Watch silver. It's going to run with it.
[3:44:15.760 --> 3:44:18.760]  Again, we'll be writing more about it.
[3:44:18.760 --> 3:44:24.760]  We are going through a period unparalleled in world history.
[3:44:24.760 --> 3:44:36.760]  26% of European tourism is driven by American tourists, and now we're barred from going to Europe.
[3:44:36.760 --> 3:44:42.760]  That means like Italy, 12% of their GDP is tourism based.
[3:44:42.760 --> 3:44:48.760]  Friends of mine in France, in the restaurant business, how's it going over there?
[3:44:48.760 --> 3:44:52.760]  We're about 20% of what they've been doing.
[3:44:52.760 --> 3:44:57.760]  When people lose everything and have nothing left to lose, they lose it.
[3:44:57.760 --> 3:45:00.760]  And you're going to see people losing it big time.
[3:45:00.760 --> 3:45:07.760]  In the future, you know me, guns, gold, and a getaway plan. GC is 3 Gs.
[3:45:07.760 --> 3:45:14.760]  And fight for peace from your heart, from your soul, and from your spirit.
[3:45:14.760 --> 3:45:30.760]  Thank you for having me on. See you next week. And remember, put your money where your mind is.
