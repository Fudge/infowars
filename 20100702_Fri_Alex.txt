[01:03.000 --> 01:07.000]  our founders fought against everything that our founders put down in that
[01:07.000 --> 01:15.000]  Declaration of Independence on July 4 1776 is back in spades on every count if you
[01:15.000 --> 01:18.000]  read that Declaration of Independence in fact later in the broadcast I'm going to
[01:18.000 --> 01:24.000]  read at least part of it on air every usurpation every abuse every form of tyranny

[01:32.000 --> 01:39.000]  foremothers heads is now back back worse than it ever was there is no doubt by
[01:39.000 --> 01:43.000]  every historical yardstick this is oppression this is corruption this is

[03:21.000 --> 03:27.000]  the latest criminal activities of the new world order and shows how this
[03:27.000 --> 03:33.000]  banking cabal is bankrupting nations by design it also shows solutions to take
[03:33.000 --> 03:38.000]  over the money system to take it back from the banksters and put it under
[03:38.000 --> 03:42.000]  Congress again and this film of course is excellent for anyone around the
[03:42.000 --> 03:46.000]  world the same bankers are robbing and looting all but a handful of nations
[03:46.000 --> 03:51.000]  the nations they don't financially control that they aren't sucking dry
[03:51.000 --> 03:58.000]  like Nosferatu on a victim or Count Dracula sucking a victim dry those who
[03:58.000 --> 04:04.000]  they don't control financially through their dictatorship are under siege by
[04:04.000 --> 04:09.000]  the new world order and under sanctions or being military bombarded or about

[04:14.000 --> 04:26.000]  the last hour today now with that said we have to somehow not get basic
[04:26.000 --> 04:31.000]  tyranny fatigue where we are so educated about what's happening we are so
[04:31.000 --> 04:40.000]  informed about what's unfolding in our world that we just become accepting of
[04:40.000 --> 04:47.000]  it number one we need to realize patriots have been right we were right
[04:47.000 --> 04:51.000]  about everything so we need to toot our horn so the sheeple will take notice
[04:51.000 --> 04:56.000]  and realize it's not too late to listen to us we also have to face the fact
[04:56.000 --> 05:01.000]  ourselves and things are more serious than we even thought the fall of
[05:01.000 --> 05:04.000]  America and the Western world is an all-new ten-hour documentary and

[06:02.000 --> 06:06.000]  solar power generator number one new climate legislation could easily
[06:06.000 --> 06:10.000]  double or triple your electric bill number two our new energies are wants
[06:10.000 --> 06:14.000]  to control how much power your electric company allows you to have it's true
[06:14.000 --> 06:18.000]  total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is
[06:18.000 --> 06:22.000]  coming number three in some areas of the country the power grid is
[06:22.000 --> 06:26.000]  dangerously overloaded and now new socialist legislation is only
[06:26.000 --> 06:30.000]  compounding the problem number four dangerous weather is always a threat to
[06:30.000 --> 06:34.000]  local grids every year thousands of families lose their power from weather
[06:34.000 --> 06:38.000]  related onages number five a solar power generator provides powerful backup
[06:38.000 --> 06:41.000]  insurance and peace of mind folks I really believe in the solar power

[08:50.000 --> 08:55.000]  broadcast specifically asking you what the fourth of July means to you the
[08:55.000 --> 08:59.000]  United States certainly hadn't been perfect but it's been the greatest
[08:59.000 --> 09:05.000]  freest most inventive nation in world history and now it has been turned
[09:05.000 --> 09:10.000]  into something diametrically opposed to its founding mission that gave us
[09:10.000 --> 09:15.000]  all of this wealth and power and freedom we have been hijacked through a
[09:15.000 --> 09:21.000]  private corporate offshore takeover and we need to reverse this criminal
[09:21.000 --> 09:28.000]  takeover now it is that simple so I'm going to open the phones up and I
[09:28.000 --> 09:33.000]  specifically want to get your take on what the fourth of July stands for and
[09:33.000 --> 09:42.000]  are you committing to try to reinvigorate the spirit of 1776 and to
[09:42.000 --> 09:46.000]  take that animating spirit of liberty and to breathe life into your
[09:46.000 --> 09:52.000]  communities and to create an example of an alternative to the sickening
[09:52.000 --> 09:58.000]  stinking corruption of the new world order we have to stand as an example
[09:58.000 --> 10:04.000]  and we have to stand as an alternative to what the world is being turned
[10:04.000 --> 10:11.000]  into let me go over some of the news that I have here in front of me today
[10:11.000 --> 10:17.000]  that we'll be covering with our guest a toll free number to join us on air is
[10:17.000 --> 10:27.000]  1-800-259-9231 1-800-259-9231 well you know Obama is pushing immigration
[10:27.000 --> 10:32.000]  reform i.e. treason the end of our country they have incredibly strict
[10:32.000 --> 10:37.000]  immigration rules to Mexico incredibly strict to Zimbabwe Africa incredibly
[10:37.000 --> 10:43.000]  strict to New Zealand now compared to what it was every other country but not
[10:43.000 --> 10:46.000]  the United States we are wide open and that was fine when there was no
[10:46.000 --> 10:51.000]  welfare but the government brings in these foreigners as a foreign political
[10:51.000 --> 10:56.000]  army like I've nothing against Eastern Europeans but in England they're
[10:56.000 --> 11:00.000]  being used as a political weapon just like the illegal aliens from Latin
[11:00.000 --> 11:04.000]  America are being used here and they're brought in and the government is their
[11:04.000 --> 11:10.000]  buddy and gives them free slop and free suckle poison government milk from the
[11:10.000 --> 11:16.000]  giant swollen poison mammary glands of hanging from the bore hogs belly the
[11:16.000 --> 11:22.000]  sow that is drunk on the blood is like a vampiric pig that's what government is
[11:22.000 --> 11:28.000]  that sucks off the productive people of the west and then disgorges it is a
[11:28.000 --> 11:33.000]  bloody meal to its pops I mean look at this video of Congressman Pete Stark
[11:33.000 --> 11:38.000]  spent out for a few days on info wars.com brazenly mocking his constituents
[11:38.000 --> 11:42.000]  going there's no problem with the border said oh you don't want an open border
[11:42.000 --> 11:45.000]  you're murdering men and why don't you kill some more people men and men have
[11:45.000 --> 11:50.000]  killed no one the illegal alien hordes are murdering police burning down old
[11:50.000 --> 11:54.000]  neighborhoods slaughtering they've taken over at least 80 miles one-third of
[11:54.000 --> 12:00.000]  Arizona total collapse Mexico's a failed society and Obama is pushing total
[12:00.000 --> 12:04.000]  treason and he told senator Kyle I'm going to leave that border open and I
[12:04.000 --> 12:09.000]  like that crime that's going on down there so so we have a pretext to pass
[12:09.000 --> 12:14.000]  immigration reform which will only make it worse but hey don't worry America's
[12:14.000 --> 12:18.000]  now collapsing Swartz and nigger just put 200,000 state employees on minimum
[12:18.000 --> 12:22.000]  wage people that have been making $25 an hour you're now going to make six
[12:22.000 --> 12:28.000]  smackers oh you like the open borders oh you want to live like they do in
[12:28.000 --> 12:35.000]  Mexico City well you are now oh globalism has destroyed America and I bet
[12:35.000 --> 12:40.000]  you're happy aren't you well good if we'd have kept Mexico contained the
[12:40.000 --> 12:44.000]  pressure would have caused an overthrow of their corrupt government and at
[12:44.000 --> 12:47.000]  least some chance of liberty down there with those people but not anymore now
[12:47.000 --> 12:51.000]  we will fall like Mexico that's the globalist model we will fall to being
[12:51.000 --> 12:56.000]  fully bankrupt the IMF and World Bank as Mexico did in the last 50 years we will
[12:56.000 --> 13:00.000]  be like Mexico captured by the global corporate board who live in their
[13:00.000 --> 13:05.000]  lavish armored compounds in Caribbean and Mediterranean and South Pacific
[13:05.000 --> 13:11.000]  Islands running the planet via satellite uplink in lavish private islands with
[13:11.000 --> 13:19.000]  all their you know five-star number 10 beauties just enjoying themselves in
[13:19.000 --> 13:25.000]  gourds on our blood they use poverty and sickness and degradation and ignorance
[13:25.000 --> 13:29.000]  the weapon and they're cutting down the west that led the world in the
[13:29.000 --> 13:35.000]  renaissance the west is falling minus Tirith is falling falling to Mordor
[13:35.000 --> 13:41.000]  dollar plunges after you and call to ditch greenback we're going to be
[13:41.000 --> 13:48.000]  covering that amazing mail online story that Matt Ryan just posted on infowars.com
[13:48.000 --> 13:53.000]  attack of the vapors how jet trails block out the sunshine and they admit
[13:53.000 --> 13:59.000]  that it's a toxic spray and they they come within one hair of admitting it's
[13:59.000 --> 14:06.000]  a chemical chemtrail weapon program see out in the open now mainstream news
[14:06.000 --> 14:10.000]  White House science are a year and a half ago first press conference John P.
[14:10.000 --> 14:15.000]  Holdren says oh we are terraforming geoengineering the earth to save you
[14:15.000 --> 14:19.000]  from global warming and ozone holes but we can't tell you the details it's
[14:19.000 --> 14:26.000]  classified oh and we happen to get the Pentagon document Aaron ferreted it out
[14:26.000 --> 14:31.000]  where they admit it's all compartmentalized through the big three kerosene
[14:31.000 --> 14:37.000]  producers that's what jet fuel is and they added and no one even knows it's
[14:37.000 --> 14:40.000]  added at the major facilities and no one even questions it's just one of the
[14:40.000 --> 14:46.000]  additives and that it's aerosolize is nuclei into the sky that's just one part
[14:46.000 --> 14:51.000]  of at least 14 different programs we've identified in the new film I'm making
[14:51.000 --> 14:55.000]  promise it's overload too much chemtrail evidence too much you know where
[14:55.000 --> 14:58.000]  they're really heading us I've discovered it's not just fluoride in the water
[14:58.000 --> 15:03.000]  and the food 900 parts per million in the powdered eggs and dressings you put
[15:03.000 --> 15:07.000]  on your food I mean one part per million is devastating 900 parts per million
[15:07.000 --> 15:12.000]  is just total chemical lobotomy the public is just completely devastated when
[15:12.000 --> 15:18.000]  they spray the toxic waste left over from the petroleum industry nickel mercury
[15:18.000 --> 15:24.000]  every heavy metal you can imagine other poisons plastics they create
[15:24.000 --> 15:28.000]  additives that are put in almost all the fast food even seen in a minute on
[15:28.000 --> 15:33.000]  Monday oh yes chicken McNuggets do have silicon in them plastic you're eating
[15:33.000 --> 15:38.000]  deadly poison it's just oh it's so funny you like that organ failure you like
[15:38.000 --> 15:43.000]  that kidney failure you like the fact that you I mean the magnitude of this
[15:43.000 --> 15:47.000]  the fact that I even have to argue with police and FBI and government people
[15:47.000 --> 15:51.000]  you didn't get a memo to not eat chicken McNuggets did you and by the way
[15:51.000 --> 15:55.000]  it's hundreds of foods have it foods at the store have it CNN admitting oh yeah
[15:55.000 --> 16:01.000]  you're eating plastic in the food silicon you know what silicon does to your kidneys
[16:01.000 --> 16:06.000]  forms crystals just like antifreeze does but it's done slower it takes years
[16:06.000 --> 16:14.000]  but even bigger in my research when I knew about it but to look at the sheer
[16:14.000 --> 16:20.000]  numbers hundreds of chemicals are put in crop fertilizer ever read what's in
[16:20.000 --> 16:23.000]  crop fertilizer or lawn fertilizer you'll even say don't put this on your
[16:23.000 --> 16:30.000]  crops but then they put it on the crops and in it is every poison and did you
[16:30.000 --> 16:36.000]  know plants pull that up into them that's why half the corn syrup has
[16:36.000 --> 16:40.000]  incredibly high levels in studies Washington Post headline half of corn
[16:40.000 --> 16:44.000]  syrup has high levels of mercury because they spray mercury on the crops and
[16:44.000 --> 16:52.000]  then you eat the corn and the wheat your family eats it all by design that's why
[16:52.000 --> 16:55.000]  I have a documentary produced by the British Royal Family one of the
[16:55.000 --> 16:59.000]  princes owns the company aired on PBS where it shows how they've got big
[16:59.000 --> 17:03.000]  palaces all over England palaces some of which that are hundreds of
[17:03.000 --> 17:08.000]  thousands of acres where all their wheat all their corn all their lettuce all
[17:08.000 --> 17:13.000]  their squash all their pumpkins all their beans all their peas all their beef
[17:13.000 --> 17:18.000]  all their chicken all their fish everything is raised there and the royal
[17:18.000 --> 17:23.000]  family has trucks that follow them and jets that follow them when they travel
[17:23.000 --> 17:30.000]  overseas and they only eat meals grown on their facilities and it's admitted in
[17:30.000 --> 17:34.000]  the show with Prince Philip taking a minute going on it's like a little
[17:34.000 --> 17:38.000]  village he goes in and buys the beef at this facility he owns and they're there
[17:38.000 --> 17:41.000]  behind the counter and he goes it's all organic all here all and he talks about
[17:41.000 --> 17:45.000]  how the food is all produced there and only shipped around and prepared for him
[17:45.000 --> 17:51.000]  and his whole family Prince Philip Queen Elizabeth the second's husband the
[17:51.000 --> 17:57.000]  German Prince I mean cops you're gonna sit there in your squad car and laugh
[17:57.000 --> 18:01.000]  at me when the corn and the wheat and the corn syrup you're eating and

[18:47.000 --> 18:52.000]  would do next and how they would cheat each other and then you can search it

[24:14.000 --> 24:19.000]  amounts are addictive and I was covering the CNN on Monday it's Friday now the
[24:19.000 --> 24:24.000]  guys search incident during the break and found a mail online not loving it
[24:24.000 --> 24:29.000]  US chicken McNuggets contain silly putty chemical and it says transatlantic taste
[24:29.000 --> 24:35.000]  McDonald's chicken McNuggets contain more calories fat and chemicals than their
[24:35.000 --> 24:40.000]  British counterparts and the boys just ran in here with the CNN they found the
[24:40.000 --> 24:48.000]  CNN here's the CNN the headline is all McNuggets are not created equal and it
[24:48.000 --> 24:54.000]  goes on to basically say the same thing CNN investigations the differences for
[24:54.000 --> 25:02.000]  receiving in McNuggets and then it goes on from there it says American McNuggets
[25:02.000 --> 25:10.000]  have 190 calories 12 grams of fat for four pieces and contain the chemical
[25:10.000 --> 25:23.000]  preservative TB HQ territory by lethal droquinone a petrochemical petroleum
[25:23.000 --> 25:37.000]  based product they also contain dimethyl polysilixine which is basically a
[25:37.000 --> 25:42.000]  component of silicon an anti foaming agent I'm sorry for some reason I've got
[25:42.000 --> 25:48.000]  good eyes but these CNN stories print the smallest I've ever seen I mean this is
[25:48.000 --> 25:53.000]  this tiny print here and it just goes on from there by contrast British McNuggets
[25:53.000 --> 25:58.000]  170 calories 9 grams of fat 1 gram of saturated fat for four pieces listen
[25:58.000 --> 26:03.000]  either chemical among its ingredients and it just goes on from there but they
[26:03.000 --> 26:08.000]  calmly report and it goes on to say it's a petrochemical byproduct left over from
[26:08.000 --> 26:14.000]  oil and they take all of the byproducts left over from crude oil I mean you're
[26:14.000 --> 26:18.000]  hearing now about all this crude oil and how it's off-gassing all these chemicals
[26:18.000 --> 26:24.000]  and dioxins and benzene and heavy metals and well that's what gets taken to
[26:24.000 --> 26:30.000]  refine race and depending on what type of crude it is in some cases more than half
[26:30.000 --> 26:35.000]  of it is just a byproduct and only half the original oil actually gets turned
[26:35.000 --> 26:43.000]  into refined gasoline and so what do they do with it well it's called distillate
[26:43.000 --> 26:48.000]  and some of it gets turned into Vaseline and some of it into motor oil and machine
[26:48.000 --> 26:53.000]  oil and kerosene and diesel and they've got all these different ways to try to
[26:53.000 --> 26:59.000]  use the byproducts but every refinery from the smallest to the largest just has
[26:59.000 --> 27:06.000]  giant giant giant tanks and huge piles and driving through Houston as a child
[27:06.000 --> 27:14.000]  I would see just pile to the sky huge stinking mountains of green and red and
[27:14.000 --> 27:18.000]  yellow chemicals and I'd say what is that dad and he'd say well that's some type
[27:18.000 --> 27:24.000]  of dioxin you can tell that's yellow and you can smell it that's sulfur and
[27:24.000 --> 27:31.000]  you know describing the Bible is the smell of hell and that's looks like a
[27:31.000 --> 27:38.000]  byproduct of some type of distillate they're gonna use for coke to melt iron
[27:38.000 --> 27:47.000]  into steel and but they take all the rest of it they can't use and they put
[27:47.000 --> 27:52.000]  it in your water they put it in my water and they put it on the crops the
[27:52.000 --> 27:57.000]  mercury the lead the arsenic what do we do with this oh we put it in the water
[27:57.000 --> 28:02.000]  and spray it on the crops and now they allow him to spray sodium fluoride as a
[28:02.000 --> 28:07.000]  pesticide on the crops because it kills the bugs oh yeah you spray some sodium
[28:07.000 --> 28:12.000]  fluoride on a grasshopper or a lady bug or anything else is dead or never in
[28:12.000 --> 28:18.000]  minutes it goes right through the plant roots and into the plants they actually
[28:18.000 --> 28:22.000]  use crops when you have a toxic dump sites they'll like go in and plant corn
[28:22.000 --> 28:26.000]  it's one of the best in just a few generations it can take out almost all
[28:26.000 --> 28:34.000]  of the poison and you eat it and I'm the conspiracy theorist I'm the bad man
[28:34.000 --> 28:40.000]  seeing in comes down here MSNBC comes down here PBS comes here all these
[28:40.000 --> 28:44.000]  networks ABC news comes here and they look at me like I'm a crazy man they
[28:44.000 --> 28:47.000]  say you really think the government wants to kill us and I go gee I've just
[28:47.000 --> 28:51.000]  got hundreds of textbooks we bought and sent off for where they say they're
[28:51.000 --> 28:55.000]  doing this to us in the last 60 years and you can go back even further in
[28:55.000 --> 29:00.000]  England over 100 and I know for a fact and they're doing it and you're so
[29:00.000 --> 29:07.000]  weak-minded you little ABC nightly news anchor they sent here you're so weak-
[29:07.000 --> 29:09.000]  minded you sit there and arrogantly laugh at me I went to dinner with them
[29:09.000 --> 29:13.000]  after I said listen this is real they just kept laughing it's just funny
[29:13.000 --> 29:18.000]  isn't it these people have children they have children and they're not going to
[29:18.000 --> 29:21.000]  look into what's in the corn they're not gonna look into what's in the corn
[29:21.000 --> 29:24.000]  syrup they're not gonna look into what's in the weed they're not gonna
[29:24.000 --> 29:27.000]  look into none of it they're not going to look into how this stuff's fed is
[29:27.000 --> 29:33.000]  animal feed to the chickens and cows and geese and pigs and how we eat it that
[29:33.000 --> 29:36.000]  way no they don't care they don't care they like it
[29:36.000 --> 29:40.000]  because they're under a mind control spell we're gonna get into all the
[29:40.000 --> 29:42.000]  We're going to get into how the dollar is imploding.
[29:42.000 --> 29:44.000]  We're going to cover it all today.
[29:44.000 --> 29:47.000]  We're going to go live at prisonplanet.tv with Gerald Salente in three minutes.
[29:47.000 --> 29:50.000]  You'll want to stay with us.
[29:50.000 --> 29:52.000]  We're on the march.
[29:52.000 --> 29:54.000]  The Empire's on the run.
[29:54.000 --> 30:20.000]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[30:20.000 --> 30:22.000]  The United Nations would take over America.
[30:22.000 --> 30:25.000]  The Tri-Lateral Commission would control the world.
[30:25.000 --> 30:27.000]  Invisible Empire Chronicles.
[30:27.000 --> 30:30.000]  How men of power and influence have worked in stealth for centuries
[30:30.000 --> 30:33.000]  to establish an oppressive world government.
[30:33.000 --> 30:37.000]  I believe, first of all, that we now need nothing short of a world constitution
[30:37.000 --> 30:39.000]  for the global financial system.
[30:39.000 --> 30:41.000]  Global governance with the establishment of the G20.
[30:41.000 --> 30:45.000]  So it's going to be an inner ruling elite and then everyone else.
[30:45.000 --> 30:47.000]  And I got news for you. You're everyone else.

[31:00.000 --> 31:03.000]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[31:03.000 --> 31:07.000]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm,
[31:07.000 --> 31:09.000]  how much ammunition do you want?
[31:09.000 --> 31:12.000]  My answer would be all I can get in the battle for freedom
[31:12.000 --> 31:14.000]  and the lives of your loved ones.
[31:14.000 --> 31:16.000]  Food is your only ammunition.
[31:16.000 --> 31:18.000]  How much do you want? When do you want it?
[31:18.000 --> 31:21.000]  Now or after the battle starts? When will you need it?
[31:21.000 --> 31:23.000]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[31:23.000 --> 31:26.000]  Will there be any food? Will it make your children sick?
[31:26.000 --> 31:28.000]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself,
[31:28.000 --> 31:31.000]  will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[31:31.000 --> 31:35.000]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[31:35.000 --> 31:39.000]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[31:39.000 --> 31:41.000]  How much will you need? We don't know.
[31:41.000 --> 31:43.000]  How much do you want? All you can get.
[31:43.000 --> 31:44.000]  I'm Alex Jones.
[31:44.000 --> 31:47.000]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.
[31:47.000 --> 31:51.000]  Call 1-800-409-5633
[31:51.000 --> 31:54.000]  or check it out on the web at eFoodsDirect.com

[31:59.000 --> 32:04.000]  The question is where should the American people draw their line in the sand?
[32:04.000 --> 32:07.000]  What have we got? A republic or a monarchy?
[32:07.000 --> 32:11.000]  A republic is based on a constitution which protects minority rights.
[32:11.000 --> 32:15.000]  Not democracy, not mob rule, two wolves and a sheep voting on what's for dinner.
[32:15.000 --> 32:18.000]  So they think they own our land, they think they own our water,
[32:18.000 --> 32:21.000]  children, our education, our money.
[32:21.000 --> 32:25.000]  We have to define who we are and what we will tolerate.
[32:25.000 --> 32:29.000]  Somebody's going to ask you what you did during the Patriot Uprising.
[32:29.000 --> 32:32.000]  We have the facts. We have the constitution.
[32:32.000 --> 32:34.000]  We have the Bill of Rights. We have common law.
[32:34.000 --> 32:36.000]  Knowledge is power, ladies and gentlemen,
[32:36.000 --> 32:38.000]  and I'm so excited to be able to offer you.
[32:38.000 --> 32:40.000]  Don't tread on me. Rise the republic.
[32:40.000 --> 32:45.000]  Tyranny is upon us, but liberty and the sleeping giant that is the American people is rising.
[32:45.000 --> 32:48.000]  A new tool in the info war. Don't tread on me.
[32:48.000 --> 32:55.000]  Order it at infowars.com or prisonplanet.com or call toll free 888-253-3139
[32:55.000 --> 33:24.000]  and support independent patriotic liberty films.
[33:24.000 --> 33:31.000]  Welcome, ladies and gentlemen, we're 33 minutes into this Friday, July 2nd, 2010 edition.
[33:31.000 --> 33:38.000]  Max Kaiser, the Kaiser report is going to be popping in with us for 15 minutes at the middle of the next hour.
[33:38.000 --> 33:42.000]  Then we have our once a week visit with Bob Chapman, the international forecaster,
[33:42.000 --> 33:46.000]  and in the last hour, we have a filmmaker who's made an amazing documentary
[33:46.000 --> 33:50.000]  about the private banking dictatorship that's taken over our society.
[33:50.000 --> 33:55.000]  But also, of course, he's the maker of the film Money Masters,
[33:55.000 --> 33:59.000]  the quintessential documentary over 14 years ago that was produced,
[33:59.000 --> 34:07.000]  Bill Still exposing how this cabal of corporate hijackers took over our nation.
[34:07.000 --> 34:10.000]  He'll be joining us in the last hour today.
[34:10.000 --> 34:16.000]  Of course, Gerald Salente is the premier trends forecaster in the world,
[34:16.000 --> 34:23.000]  and he joins us once a month, but things are getting so fast and furious
[34:23.000 --> 34:26.000]  and the birthing pains are getting closer and closer together.
[34:26.000 --> 34:31.000]  As the war with Iran looms, as the mainstream media and the Wall Street Journal,
[34:31.000 --> 34:35.000]  New York Times, Krugman admits, it's the third depression.
[34:35.000 --> 34:38.000]  I'm hearing the term the greatest depression being used.
[34:38.000 --> 34:42.000]  Obama's talking about the greatest recession, so they're trying to spin.
[34:42.000 --> 34:46.000]  Gerald Salente's term that he coined.
[34:46.000 --> 34:52.000]  Gerald Salente, of course, is in my film Fall of the Republic, the presidency of Barack H. Obama,
[34:52.000 --> 34:57.000]  and he's also in Obama deception, and these two films really describe
[34:57.000 --> 35:01.000]  how this criminal network is bringing our society down by design.
[35:01.000 --> 35:06.000]  And so Gerald Salente joins us for one segment today,
[35:06.000 --> 35:09.000]  because I looked on the Drudge Report this morning,
[35:09.000 --> 35:14.000]  and I noticed that Paul Watson's article from yesterday
[35:14.000 --> 35:22.000]  describing how the United Nations has come out and badmouthed the greenback
[35:22.000 --> 35:25.000]  saying all global currencies need to basically die,
[35:25.000 --> 35:28.000]  and that the private central banks that orchestrated this collapse
[35:28.000 --> 35:32.000]  will now have a new global currency, SDR, that's cashless,
[35:32.000 --> 35:34.000]  and that will still have our currencies.
[35:34.000 --> 35:38.000]  They'll just be pegged to this, and this unelected offshore group of crooks
[35:38.000 --> 35:42.000]  will now have control over the dollar, and that article,
[35:42.000 --> 35:47.000]  one of the top stories on Drudge is dollar plunges after a U.N. call to ditch greenback,
[35:47.000 --> 35:51.000]  and of course we link to that U.N. report, and at the bottom of our report
[35:51.000 --> 35:57.000]  we link to Gerald Salente's excellent analysis and breakdown on this.
[35:57.000 --> 36:01.000]  So this is good news that the biggest news site in the world, the Drudge Report,
[36:01.000 --> 36:06.000]  is linking to our analysis as well as Gerald Salente's analysis,
[36:06.000 --> 36:11.000]  because if we're able to expose these crooks and not have them manage this crisis
[36:11.000 --> 36:16.000]  and use it to get more power and control, we can defeat this new world order.
[36:16.000 --> 36:18.000]  So joining us is Gerald Salente.
[36:18.000 --> 36:20.000]  Gerald, thanks for coming on on short notice.
[36:20.000 --> 36:23.000]  Always my pleasure, Alex.
[36:23.000 --> 36:25.000]  Well, break it down for us.
[36:25.000 --> 36:30.000]  You, for the last two, three years, have been really with stunning accuracy,
[36:30.000 --> 36:33.000]  chronicling exactly what was going to unfold.
[36:33.000 --> 36:37.000]  You've predicted by the end of 2010 that they won't be able to deny
[36:37.000 --> 36:41.000]  that we are in a full-blown depression for the last two years,
[36:41.000 --> 36:42.000]  that they've been covering it up.
[36:42.000 --> 36:46.000]  Now, all the economic data is coming out, just piling onto your predictions.
[36:46.000 --> 36:51.000]  So go over your past prediction and then tell us currently where we're at
[36:51.000 --> 36:55.000]  and any tweaking on your forecast of where we're going.
[36:55.000 --> 37:00.000]  Well, in 2004, actually, we wrote in the Trends Journal,
[37:00.000 --> 37:03.000]  and it's on our website, TrendsJournal.com,
[37:03.000 --> 37:09.000]  that by the end of 2007, we'd enter, quote, the Great Recession.
[37:09.000 --> 37:14.000]  In 2007, we even took the domain name out,
[37:14.000 --> 37:19.000]  and it was one of our top trends for 2008, the Panic of 08.
[37:19.000 --> 37:22.000]  Then we forecast in 08 the collapse of 09.
[37:22.000 --> 37:26.000]  The markets collapsed in March of 09.
[37:26.000 --> 37:31.000]  And the only thing that they did was to pump them up with bailout
[37:31.000 --> 37:35.000]  and stimulus money worldwide.
[37:35.000 --> 37:43.000]  China, all of Europe, the UK, Australia, Japan, South Korea,
[37:43.000 --> 37:46.000]  you name the company, the company, that's the right word.
[37:46.000 --> 37:51.000]  I meant to say country, but company fits because that's the ones they're bailing out.
[37:51.000 --> 37:55.000]  The banks, the big companies, they flooded the world with stimulus money.
[37:55.000 --> 38:00.000]  The games ran out. The game ran out with the Greek crisis.
[38:00.000 --> 38:05.000]  So now what we have is the reality, and now as you mentioned,
[38:05.000 --> 38:07.000]  you're hearing people like Krugman.
[38:07.000 --> 38:15.000]  I call the New York Times, Alex, calls what I have to say pessimism porn.
[38:15.000 --> 38:21.000]  So therefore, Krugman, from the toilet paper of record,
[38:21.000 --> 38:27.000]  comes out two years too late and a couple of weeks behind
[38:27.000 --> 38:35.000]  saying that, quote, he fears that we're going to enter into a depression, fears.
[38:35.000 --> 38:40.000]  Oh, but if they listened to Krugman and company, they could get out of it
[38:40.000 --> 38:44.000]  because he says it's about policy.
[38:44.000 --> 38:50.000]  And the policy that he recommends is dump more money into the system,
[38:50.000 --> 38:56.000]  into more stimulus so that it's like you having a second mortgage,
[38:56.000 --> 38:59.000]  you can't pay it off, and I say, hey, listen, Alex,
[38:59.000 --> 39:04.000]  how about taking out a third mortgage so you could pile some more debt on top of it?
[39:04.000 --> 39:06.000]  So the games run out.
[39:06.000 --> 39:09.000]  They're not going to throw any more stimulus into this.
[39:09.000 --> 39:13.000]  It is austerity, austerity means, by the way,
[39:13.000 --> 39:18.000]  you take pay cuts and you pay higher taxes to bail out the banks.
[39:18.000 --> 39:20.000]  We're going into the greatest depression.
[39:20.000 --> 39:25.000]  However, they're also taking us on the path to war.
[39:25.000 --> 39:28.000]  And this is what we wrote when the bailouts began,
[39:28.000 --> 39:32.000]  when the bailout bubble bursts, when all else fails,
[39:32.000 --> 39:36.000]  they become emboldened by their failures and they take us to war.
[39:36.000 --> 39:39.000]  That's what we fear is next.
[39:39.000 --> 39:41.000]  Gerald Salente is our guest.
[39:41.000 --> 39:47.000]  Gerald, we're now seeing Schwarzenegger make 200,000 employees
[39:47.000 --> 39:49.000]  of California take minimum wage.
[39:49.000 --> 39:52.000]  Some of these are 10, 20, 30-year employees
[39:52.000 --> 39:55.000]  who were making $20, $30 an hour.
[39:55.000 --> 39:59.000]  Now they're supposed to live on $6 an hour.
[39:59.000 --> 40:04.000]  We see Bloomberg reporting that 46 states are bankrupt
[40:04.000 --> 40:07.000]  or on the verge of going bankrupt.
[40:07.000 --> 40:11.000]  And the government's answer is raise federal and state taxes
[40:11.000 --> 40:14.000]  by record levels in modern history.
[40:14.000 --> 40:17.000]  And California did that two years ago.
[40:17.000 --> 40:19.000]  And lo and behold, their tax receipts went down.
[40:19.000 --> 40:21.000]  Kennedy cut taxes by 50%.
[40:21.000 --> 40:23.000]  Tax receipts double.
[40:23.000 --> 40:26.000]  Government knows when you cut taxes, more money comes in
[40:26.000 --> 40:29.000]  because the economy speeds up and becomes more healthy.
[40:29.000 --> 40:34.000]  So then by this measurement, they know that the taxes increasing
[40:34.000 --> 40:36.000]  is going to further destroy the economy.
[40:36.000 --> 40:39.000]  What is the method to the madness?
[40:39.000 --> 40:41.000]  Look who they are.
[40:41.000 --> 40:44.000]  As I mentioned, these are the people we used to go to high school
[40:44.000 --> 40:48.000]  and college with that wanted to become the class president
[40:48.000 --> 40:50.000]  and the head of the student council.
[40:50.000 --> 40:56.000]  They were suck ups, brown noses, self-serving, ambitious jerks
[40:56.000 --> 40:59.000]  that most people didn't want to hang around with.
[40:59.000 --> 41:01.000]  They follow their career paths.
[41:01.000 --> 41:03.000]  They've been in competence forever.
[41:03.000 --> 41:05.000]  Let's look at the facts.
[41:05.000 --> 41:09.000]  They have Katrina quality rescue skills.
[41:09.000 --> 41:12.000]  Hey, great job you're doing over there in the Gulf.
[41:12.000 --> 41:14.000]  How about fixing healthcare?
[41:14.000 --> 41:16.000]  No, I have it.
[41:16.000 --> 41:17.000]  Why not?
[41:17.000 --> 41:19.000]  Let's reform education.
[41:19.000 --> 41:21.000]  Let's start a war on drugs.
[41:21.000 --> 41:23.000]  Let's go bigger than that.
[41:23.000 --> 41:26.000]  Let's have wars in Afghanistan and Iraq.
[41:26.000 --> 41:27.000]  They're losers.
[41:27.000 --> 41:31.000]  Everything they touch, they turn to rot.
[41:31.000 --> 41:33.000]  They are incapable.
[41:33.000 --> 41:36.000]  And if you want to start cutting back,
[41:36.000 --> 41:40.000]  let's start cutting back on these jumbo jets
[41:40.000 --> 41:44.000]  that the secretaries of this and that ride around in
[41:44.000 --> 41:48.000]  and every time they go and make a state visit,
[41:48.000 --> 41:50.000]  it's the same predictable scene.
[41:50.000 --> 41:54.000]  Here they are waving from the gangway
[41:54.000 --> 41:58.000]  to a crowd below of other dignitaries
[41:58.000 --> 42:02.000]  bowing and scraping when they roll out a red carpet
[42:02.000 --> 42:04.000]  and strike up the band.
[42:04.000 --> 42:07.000]  Who is kidding who with this stuff?
[42:07.000 --> 42:08.000]  They're robbing us blind.
[42:08.000 --> 42:10.000]  They're living like royalty.
[42:10.000 --> 42:14.000]  They're cutting back on everybody's salaries
[42:14.000 --> 42:19.000]  so the people at the top could keep the game going the same.
[42:19.000 --> 42:21.000]  And it's coming to a head.
[42:21.000 --> 42:24.000]  I mean, when you realize they spend billions and billions
[42:24.000 --> 42:28.000]  a year just for Congress people to fly around
[42:28.000 --> 42:31.000]  on the equivalent of Air Force One type jets,
[42:31.000 --> 42:32.000]  and you're correct.
[42:32.000 --> 42:34.000]  There are news that even their aides and secretaries
[42:34.000 --> 42:36.000]  are flying on private jets.
[42:36.000 --> 42:40.000]  Meanwhile, I fly coach.
[42:40.000 --> 42:42.000]  I mean, this cannot continue.
[42:42.000 --> 42:45.000]  It just shows their Marie Antoinette attitude.
[42:45.000 --> 42:47.000]  And speaking of that, this article,
[42:47.000 --> 42:51.000]  Dollar Plunge after UN called the Ditch Greenback,
[42:51.000 --> 42:55.000]  the G20 meets these 20 central bankers,
[42:55.000 --> 42:59.000]  most of them Harvard, Yale, Princeton, Goldman Sachs alumni.
[42:59.000 --> 43:01.000]  They've stolen trillions of dollars publicly.
[43:01.000 --> 43:03.000]  They engineered the Ponzi scheme.
[43:03.000 --> 43:07.000]  And 1.2 billion is spent on their security.
[43:07.000 --> 43:11.000]  That is almost the budget of Toronto every year in three days.
[43:11.000 --> 43:14.000]  I mean, just to show how unsustainable this is,
[43:14.000 --> 43:16.000]  how they want to bankrupt us.
[43:16.000 --> 43:19.000]  And the United Nations says that the dollar is going to be dead,
[43:19.000 --> 43:21.000]  that other currencies are going to be dead,
[43:21.000 --> 43:24.000]  and that we have to set up a world government.
[43:24.000 --> 43:26.000]  And that's what these banks have been pushing for decades,
[43:26.000 --> 43:30.000]  where we pay carbon taxes to the central banks
[43:30.000 --> 43:35.000]  to issue a new SDR that our money is backed up by.
[43:35.000 --> 43:37.000]  I mean, this is incredible.
[43:37.000 --> 43:39.000]  The very same crooks that have done all of this
[43:39.000 --> 43:42.000]  say their solution is give them more power.
[43:42.000 --> 43:45.000]  And Obama's banking reform bill,
[43:45.000 --> 43:47.000]  even the Washington Post admits,
[43:47.000 --> 43:50.000]  gives unlimited power to the Federal Reserve
[43:50.000 --> 43:53.000]  to manage all sectors of the economy.
[43:53.000 --> 43:55.000]  So we have a banking dictatorship.
[43:55.000 --> 43:59.000]  I mean, Gerald, the media is so worried about 11 Russian spies,
[43:59.000 --> 44:00.000]  especially over here.
[44:00.000 --> 44:03.000]  You notice they were infiltrating Harvard and corporations
[44:03.000 --> 44:05.000]  because that's the government.
[44:05.000 --> 44:07.000]  Those are the governments, like you always say,
[44:07.000 --> 44:09.000]  Harvard's what's hijacked America.
[44:09.000 --> 44:11.000]  The Russians know what to infiltrate
[44:11.000 --> 44:13.000]  because we don't have a government.
[44:13.000 --> 44:18.000]  Congress is ceremonial and globalism is a private corporate takeover
[44:18.000 --> 44:20.000]  of a bunch of arrogant, yuppie scum.
[44:20.000 --> 44:22.000]  Your take on this.
[44:22.000 --> 44:24.000]  Well, you hit it on the head with it,
[44:24.000 --> 44:27.000]  what the UN is talking about with the one currency.
[44:27.000 --> 44:30.000]  And it's happening and that's why we fear it's going.
[44:30.000 --> 44:32.000]  That's why I mentioned the war card.
[44:32.000 --> 44:34.000]  If the war card is played,
[44:34.000 --> 44:37.000]  they'll frighten the people into something like that.
[44:37.000 --> 44:42.000]  We're watching the euro disintegrate in front of our eyes.
[44:42.000 --> 44:44.000]  There's going to be a time when the countries
[44:44.000 --> 44:46.000]  are going to be bailing out of it.
[44:46.000 --> 44:49.000]  Nobody's meeting the master agreement accords
[44:49.000 --> 44:54.000]  on their ratios of budget deficits, GDP, et cetera.
[44:54.000 --> 44:58.000]  So what we're looking at, again, current events form future trends.
[44:58.000 --> 45:01.000]  What's the Dow at now, Alex?
[45:01.000 --> 45:05.000]  It's at March 1999 levels.
[45:05.000 --> 45:06.000]  Hey, stay in the market.
[45:06.000 --> 45:07.000]  Don't worry about it.
[45:07.000 --> 45:09.000]  This is a buying opportunity.
[45:09.000 --> 45:11.000]  You have to be in it for the long term.
[45:11.000 --> 45:14.000]  What was gold doing back in 1999?
[45:14.000 --> 45:17.000]  Oh, it was around $250 an ounce.
[45:17.000 --> 45:19.000]  Oh, and what's it today?
[45:19.000 --> 45:21.000]  Oh, around $1,200 an ounce.
[45:21.000 --> 45:24.000]  But you know, by stock, and they make fun of everybody
[45:24.000 --> 45:30.000]  that wants to buy gold, particularly the toilet paper of record,
[45:30.000 --> 45:35.000]  they call us gold bugs, gloom and doomers,
[45:35.000 --> 45:38.000]  because we don't buy into their line of baloney.
[45:38.000 --> 45:41.000]  Remember, I talked about the people that we couldn't stand
[45:41.000 --> 45:44.000]  that wanted to be the class presidents and the student council.
[45:44.000 --> 45:46.000]  Now, I've noticed that all these globalists,
[45:46.000 --> 45:49.000]  it doesn't matter if it's George Bush or Rick Perry
[45:49.000 --> 45:51.000]  or Trent Lott or Al Gore.
[45:51.000 --> 45:53.000]  They're all male cheerleaders.
[45:53.000 --> 45:55.000]  Exactly.
[45:55.000 --> 45:57.000]  And then there's the other ones, Alex.
[45:57.000 --> 46:01.000]  The other ones were the writers for the school newspaper.
[46:01.000 --> 46:03.000]  Here they are.
[46:03.000 --> 46:05.000]  And they're in front of us.
[46:05.000 --> 46:07.000]  They're Brian Williams.
[46:07.000 --> 46:09.000]  They're Katie Corrick.
[46:09.000 --> 46:11.000]  They're Matt Lowers.
[46:11.000 --> 46:15.000]  They're the people that used to write things about the president,
[46:15.000 --> 46:17.000]  the principal, excuse me.
[46:17.000 --> 46:19.000]  It's high school.
[46:19.000 --> 46:21.000]  Nothing has changed.
[46:21.000 --> 46:27.000]  There are tame little reporters saying what the principal wants them to say.
[46:27.000 --> 46:30.000]  They get away with murder, literally.
[46:30.000 --> 46:32.000]  And by the way, talking about murder,
[46:32.000 --> 46:36.000]  I'm sick of hearing these lefties talk about,
[46:36.000 --> 46:39.000]  oh, these Tea Party people are crazy.
[46:39.000 --> 46:41.000]  Boy, if they got into power,
[46:41.000 --> 46:45.000]  oh, yeah, they'd be sending predator drones into Pakistan
[46:45.000 --> 46:47.000]  and killing innocent people.
[46:47.000 --> 46:51.000]  Oh, yeah, they'd be escalating the war in Afghanistan.
[46:51.000 --> 46:55.000]  Oh, yeah, they'd be putting huge military bases in Iraq.
[46:55.000 --> 46:57.000]  They're worried about the Tea Party.
[46:57.000 --> 46:59.000]  They'd be continuing torture.
[46:59.000 --> 47:03.000]  They would be introducing legislation to secretly arrest citizens.
[47:03.000 --> 47:05.000]  Oh, that's the Democrats.
[47:05.000 --> 47:09.000]  Oh, yeah, right. I thought it was the Tea Party people.
[47:09.000 --> 47:12.000]  Well, Gerald, specifically, because you've said that,
[47:12.000 --> 47:14.000]  and you've been saying this for the last year,
[47:14.000 --> 47:16.000]  do you see the total depression collapse
[47:16.000 --> 47:20.000]  or the media admitting we're in a depression by the end of 2010?
[47:20.000 --> 47:22.000]  How do you see that unrolling?
[47:22.000 --> 47:29.000]  And in which direction do you see a new international order emerging?
[47:29.000 --> 47:33.000]  The direction of the new international order emerging,
[47:33.000 --> 47:35.000]  it has to get to a catastrophic level.
[47:35.000 --> 47:38.000]  And that's what we fear about war.
[47:38.000 --> 47:41.000]  And the depression is unfolding in front of us now.
[47:41.000 --> 47:45.000]  We're seeing today's unemployment numbers.
[47:45.000 --> 47:46.000]  Oh, they increased.
[47:46.000 --> 47:47.000]  Gee, son of a gun.
[47:47.000 --> 47:49.000]  Oh, those factory orders?
[47:49.000 --> 47:53.000]  You know, they were worse than, quote, expected, expected by home.
[47:53.000 --> 47:56.000]  Oh, how about those new home sales that collapsed?
[47:56.000 --> 47:57.000]  It's in front of us.
[47:57.000 --> 48:02.000]  It's going, all the data is adding up to a crash.
[48:02.000 --> 48:05.000]  We believe it's going to be a currency crash.
[48:05.000 --> 48:09.000]  That's our best estimate in thinking about this at the point.
[48:09.000 --> 48:14.000]  It's going to be a currency crash that's going to collapse the markets.
[48:14.000 --> 48:19.000]  Break that down because you've talked about how all major currencies are doomed.
[48:19.000 --> 48:23.000]  You, Ron Paul, countless other economists and researchers have stated
[48:23.000 --> 48:28.000]  that this fractional reserve banking system is designed to consolidate power
[48:28.000 --> 48:30.000]  in the Ponzi scheme operators' hands.
[48:30.000 --> 48:32.000]  And we're now reaching that global meltdown.
[48:32.000 --> 48:36.000]  And the UN says that all major currencies are going to fail.
[48:36.000 --> 48:40.000]  Again, their answer is a world government backed up by carbon taxes.
[48:40.000 --> 48:42.000]  How do you see that unfolding?
[48:42.000 --> 48:45.000]  What we see first is a collapsing in Europe.
[48:45.000 --> 48:46.000]  They can't sustain it.
[48:46.000 --> 48:50.000]  If you think our banks are in bad shape, theirs are in even worse.
[48:50.000 --> 48:56.000]  And I'm sick of hearing this is an American-grown problem with our subprime mortgages.
[48:56.000 --> 48:58.000]  It's much bigger than that.
[48:58.000 --> 49:01.000]  You go to Spain, Ireland, you go around.
[49:01.000 --> 49:07.000]  They overbuilt these areas just like they did in Florida and Las Vegas.
[49:07.000 --> 49:09.000]  They have their own stuff.
[49:09.000 --> 49:15.000]  And so we're looking at the central banks in Europe are doing exactly what they said
[49:15.000 --> 49:17.000]  they weren't going to do.
[49:17.000 --> 49:19.000]  They're buying up all the bad paper.
[49:19.000 --> 49:21.000]  It's going to run out.
[49:21.000 --> 49:24.000]  We believe the collapse is going to happen in Europe.
[49:24.000 --> 49:27.000]  Oh, and here's what's going to happen before then.
[49:27.000 --> 49:33.000]  We're going to start seeing more and more terrorism and what you saw happen in Toronto.
[49:33.000 --> 49:35.000]  They know what's going on.
[49:35.000 --> 49:37.000]  That was a test.
[49:37.000 --> 49:42.000]  What did they spend at the G20 meeting to protect the, quote, leaders?
[49:42.000 --> 49:43.000]  What leaders?
[49:43.000 --> 49:47.000]  A leader doesn't have fear to walk by themselves.
[49:47.000 --> 49:52.000]  They don't have to spend a billion dollars to protect them.
[49:52.000 --> 49:58.000]  That was a, the people are uprising around the world.
[49:58.000 --> 50:00.000]  So that's what we're looking at.
[50:00.000 --> 50:09.000]  Simultaneous issues, terrorism, uprisings by the populations, a currency crisis,
[50:09.000 --> 50:12.000]  and equity markets collapsing at the same time.
[50:12.000 --> 50:15.000]  And you know what, Alex?
[50:15.000 --> 50:26.000]  The BP disaster, unfortunately, looks as though it's going to be the dust bowl of the 21st century.
[50:26.000 --> 50:30.000]  Gerald Solente, I was just going to have you for one second because I know you're busy today.
[50:30.000 --> 50:35.000]  But can you come back with a little five minute segment and give us your breakdown on where the oil spill's going?
[50:35.000 --> 50:36.000]  Yes, I can.
[50:36.000 --> 50:37.000]  Excellent. Thank you.
[50:37.000 --> 50:39.000]  Gerald Solente is our guest.
[50:39.000 --> 50:46.000]  We'll give you his website on the other side and tell you how to subscribe to his Must Read Trends Journal.

[50:54.000 --> 50:55.000]  I know I do.

[52:28.000 --> 52:34.000]  How men of power and influence have worked in stealth for centuries to establish an oppressive world government.
[52:34.000 --> 52:39.000]  I believe, first of all, that we now need nothing short of a world constitution for the global financial system.
[52:39.000 --> 52:42.000]  Global governance with the establishment of the G20.
[52:42.000 --> 52:46.000]  So it's going to be an inner ruling elite and then everyone else.
[52:46.000 --> 52:47.000]  And I got news for you.
[52:47.000 --> 52:48.000]  You're everyone else.

[53:04.000 --> 53:09.000]  As an authorized Berkey dealer for over four years and serving thousands of satisfied customers,

[54:06.000 --> 54:12.000]  The MO of this global corporate crime syndicate that's overthrowing every nation on earth
[54:12.000 --> 54:16.000]  is to create a crisis that offer their solution.
[54:16.000 --> 54:21.000]  That's why it's so important to get the film Fall of the Republic because it details who these people are,
[54:21.000 --> 54:27.000]  what they've done, how they're going to abolish the world currencies or devalue them and then have this new SDR.
[54:27.000 --> 54:30.000]  I made this film six months ago, Fall of the Republic.
[54:30.000 --> 54:32.000]  I made the Obama deception 14 months ago.
[54:32.000 --> 54:34.000]  These films are evergreen.
[54:34.000 --> 54:36.000]  They're more pertinent today than they ever were.
[54:36.000 --> 54:40.000]  Get them on DVD at infowars.com.
[54:40.000 --> 54:44.000]  Now, going back to Gerald Salente of the Trends Research Institute.
[54:44.000 --> 54:49.000]  Gerald, I want you to get into the oil spill and where you see that going and you're comparing it to the dust bowl.
[54:49.000 --> 54:52.000]  I think that's an excellent parallel.
[54:52.000 --> 55:00.000]  But first, tell us about the Trends Research Institute, the website, TrendsResearch.com and how people can subscribe to it.
[55:00.000 --> 55:03.000]  Well, our Trends Journal is accordingly.
[55:03.000 --> 55:07.000]  We're coming out this summer edition in just a few weeks.
[55:07.000 --> 55:12.000]  And we have a discount request page as well because we know people having a difficult time.
[55:12.000 --> 55:14.000]  We try to make it available to everyone.
[55:14.000 --> 55:24.000]  And in the upcoming Trends Journal, there'll be a white paper done by Dr. Robert Shock, the distinguished geologist who's renowned for his work,
[55:24.000 --> 55:30.000]  along with my colleague and executive editor of the Trends Journal, John Anthony West,
[55:30.000 --> 55:38.000]  who's proven geologically that the weathering at the base of the Sphinx is 10,000 years older than currently dated,
[55:38.000 --> 55:46.000]  which means that it predates the Sahara Desert and that we weren't hunters and gatherers when they built this.
[55:46.000 --> 55:51.000]  Well, Dr. Shock has done a white paper on the oil disaster.
[55:51.000 --> 55:56.000]  And the short of it is that this is not a leaking pipe.
[55:56.000 --> 56:03.000]  This is a fracture and the damage is going to be far greater than what they're telling us it's going to be.
[56:03.000 --> 56:07.000]  So there's going to be a lot more of that in this paper.
[56:07.000 --> 56:15.000]  So we see this as a disaster that, you know, it can be those kind of things that just keep adding up if we have a...
[56:15.000 --> 56:22.000]  Hey, how about building some more nuclear power plants that Obama's alternative energy plant?
[56:22.000 --> 56:26.000]  Yeah, a couple of more Chernobyl's, a couple of more big oil leaks.
[56:26.000 --> 56:29.000]  Oh, let's start a real good war.
[56:29.000 --> 56:36.000]  Shoot off a couple of nukes and maybe the mystery of the Sphinx won't be a mystery anymore.
[56:36.000 --> 56:45.000]  Civilizations may wipe themselves out because we have the imbeciles in control now that are leading us down that path.
[56:45.000 --> 56:52.000]  Gerald Solentia, what's going to happen to Obama? He now has the lowest approval rating ever. He's topped even his previous record.
[56:52.000 --> 56:56.000]  They know that they have destroyed themselves politically.
[56:56.000 --> 57:00.000]  Every incumbent, whether they be Republican or Democrat, has been losing in the primaries.
[57:00.000 --> 57:06.000]  This is a political realignment that you predicted four years ago. Where do you see that going?
[57:06.000 --> 57:10.000]  A new third party. We're calling it progressive libertarian at this point.
[57:10.000 --> 57:19.000]  Progressive in terms of environmental issues, the things, the advertisers you have on your show about foods and heirlooms, seeds, etc.
[57:19.000 --> 57:27.000]  Environmental with progressive in terms of education, not the stupid system we have now.
[57:27.000 --> 57:34.000]  And libertarian in the Ron Paul Papu Cannon field of not becoming involved in foreign entanglements,
[57:34.000 --> 57:40.000]  having sleazeballs like Spitzer, the governor of New York, putting laws into place,
[57:40.000 --> 57:48.000]  breaking johns for going out with prostitutes as he's paying for high-paid ones down in Washington, D.C.
[57:48.000 --> 57:53.000]  The libertarian in a sense, as of that, in government getting out of your business.
[57:53.000 --> 58:01.000]  So that's what we see happening. If that party is stopped by the control of the two-headed one-party system,
[58:01.000 --> 58:07.000]  who the Democrats or Republicans is going to put up? So Obama runs, who the Republicans are going to put up?
[58:07.000 --> 58:14.000]  Hey, how about John McCain again? Or Bonner? Or Shelby? Or Mickey Mouse?
[58:14.000 --> 58:22.000]  Mitt Romney and The Fainter Petraeus. Gerald Salente will talk to you again later in the month for a full-hour interview.
[58:22.000 --> 58:28.000]  Thank you so much for spending time with us, TrendsResearch.com, our website's infowars.com.
[58:28.000 --> 58:33.000]  God bless you. I wish you weren't right, but it's better to know what's going on than to be ignorant in the dark.
[58:33.000 --> 58:40.000]  We'll talk to you again soon. Thank you. There goes Gerald Salente. We'll be back in 70 seconds with a second hour.
[58:40.000 --> 58:59.000]  Thank you for listening to GCN. Be sure to visit GCNLive.com today.

[01:00:22.000 --> 01:00:29.000]  We just had Gerald Salente from the TrendsResearch Institute on for 30 minutes come up at the bottom of the hour. Max Kaiser joins us.
[01:00:29.000 --> 01:00:36.000]  I want to open the phones up some, but I also want to get back into dollar plunges after you and Cole to ditch Greenback.
[01:00:36.000 --> 01:00:42.000]  I've been discovering this since CNN and the UN started putting out this propaganda on Tuesday.
[01:00:42.000 --> 01:00:51.000]  Now, I know this is old news to our listeners and old news to anybody that's seen fall the Republic or Obama deception or end game that I made almost four years ago.
[01:00:51.000 --> 01:01:03.000]  Because it's all stated what they planned, how they would destroy the economy, how they would, you'd still have your currency, but it'll be based on a world government system and backed up by carbon taxes.
[01:01:03.000 --> 01:01:12.000]  I love that will be these SDRs. I'll be discussing that, but I'm going to tell the story after the break. Let's take a call right now.
[01:01:12.000 --> 01:01:20.000]  Erica in California, you're on the air. Welcome, Erica. Hi, Alex. How are you today? I'm excellent. Thank you for joining us.
[01:01:20.000 --> 01:01:27.000]  Sure. Well, I was just calling in response to your request at the beginning of the show about what the Fourth of July means to you.
[01:01:27.000 --> 01:01:37.000]  Exactly. My parents immigrated here from a small country called Latvia, so I'm first generation in the United States.
[01:01:37.000 --> 01:01:46.000]  They waited five years in displaced persons camps to come here legally. My mom and family couldn't even come to the States because they weren't able to get a sponsor.
[01:01:46.000 --> 01:01:58.000]  I grew up with my grandparents telling me all the stories about what they went through to escape Stalin's regime.
[01:01:58.000 --> 01:02:02.000]  I had family members who were on the dreaded list and got the knock on the door.
[01:02:02.000 --> 01:02:10.000]  I had family members who were hiding out in the woods for weeks just to not have to be taken away.
[01:02:10.000 --> 01:02:16.000]  I grew up with a real appreciation for what my family had gone through to come to this amazing country.
[01:02:16.000 --> 01:02:25.000]  To be where we are now, arguably one generation later, it's unbelievable to me. I'm the mom of a five-year-old little girl.
[01:02:25.000 --> 01:02:33.000]  To see where we are now and to realize, wow, my parents were able to escape that to come here, and here we are. Where would we go?
[01:02:33.000 --> 01:02:42.000]  The saying is, those who don't know history are doomed to repeat it. Humans behave the same, whether it was 5,000 years ago, 100 years ago, or today.
[01:02:42.000 --> 01:02:51.000]  There's just a high-tech overlay, and the propaganda is a lot more flowery and fancy, but we know this means bondage.
[01:02:51.000 --> 01:03:02.000]  Being a slave is a horrible thing, and living under an oppressive system where all these little nobodies get to rule over you and have their way with your women and your men.
[01:03:02.000 --> 01:03:11.000]  To see your men and your children drug away. In the history books, the CPS will be known as the Stalin's NKVD of America.
[01:03:11.000 --> 01:03:19.000]  To talk to Eastern Europeans and the hell they went through and to talk to Germans and people who suffered at the hands of Hitler,
[01:03:19.000 --> 01:03:27.000]  we know what black uniforms and black masks and secret arrests and knocks on the door and political police mean 100% of the time.
[01:03:27.000 --> 01:03:32.000]  This is an even more sophisticated evil, and this is a life-and-death situation.
[01:03:32.000 --> 01:03:37.000]  That's why I really like people who've come from true tyrannies because they value freedom.
[01:03:37.000 --> 01:03:45.000]  If you go back to our forefathers, they had an experience with tyranny, and that's why they were serious and focused.
[01:03:45.000 --> 01:04:01.000]  It was the French philosopher Victor Hugo who said that hard times and tragedy makes men and plenty and decadence makes monsters to paraphrase them.
[01:04:01.000 --> 01:04:12.000]  He said it much more simply. I'm paraphrasing it, but absolutely, we've turned into decadent slobs, and we don't understand what is upon us right now. Anything else?
[01:04:12.000 --> 01:04:18.000]  Yeah, well, it's funny because I actually was a history major at Harvard, but I was one of the good guys.
[01:04:18.000 --> 01:04:27.000]  It's in the books, and I think very recently I've just gotten even more chilled like sleepless nights just thinking about what's going on because it has happened.
[01:04:27.000 --> 01:04:32.000]  It's happened to good people, and the fact that people around me don't even see it.
[01:04:32.000 --> 01:04:43.000]  I'm doing the best I can to people and sharing your movies. I think the Don't Tread on Me movie that you have on your website is amazing in terms of educating people about it.
[01:04:43.000 --> 01:04:51.000]  Erica, stay there. I want you to be able to finish up your point and talk about some of what your folks went through in Eastern Europe under Stalin and others.
[01:04:51.000 --> 01:05:03.000]  Then we'll go to George, Mark, Derry, Chris, and others. Stay with us.

[01:06:01.000 --> 01:06:05.000]  Hi, folks. This is Alex Jones, and I want to tell you about the Silver Lungs Generator.
[01:06:05.000 --> 01:06:14.000]  Now you can produce pure and endless colloidal silver and deliver the solution directly into the bloodstream by breathing the solution through the lungs.
[01:06:14.000 --> 01:06:19.000]  The respiratory system is the first line of defense for airborne pathogens and viruses.
[01:06:19.000 --> 01:06:30.000]  The Silver Lungs Generator infuses the respiratory system with your self-produced nano-silver solutions and also delivers the silver nanoparticles instantly into the bloodstream.
[01:06:30.000 --> 01:06:40.000]  With continued legislation threatening the sale of nano-silver products, you can now produce pure and endless colloidal silver with the Silver Lungs Generator.
[01:06:40.000 --> 01:06:45.000]  Very easy to follow step-by-step instructions are provided, making production fast and simple.
[01:06:45.000 --> 01:06:53.000]  Go to www.silverlungs.com today and learn more about the breakthrough technology of the Silver Lungs Generator.
[01:06:53.000 --> 01:06:59.000]  That's www.silverlungs.com.
[01:06:59.000 --> 01:07:04.000]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[01:07:04.000 --> 01:07:08.000]  Number one, new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[01:07:08.000 --> 01:07:14.000]  Number two, our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[01:07:14.000 --> 01:07:19.000]  It's true. Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[01:07:19.000 --> 01:07:24.000]  Number three, in some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[01:07:24.000 --> 01:07:31.000]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem. Number four, dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[01:07:31.000 --> 01:07:35.000]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related onages.
[01:07:35.000 --> 01:07:40.000]  Number five, a solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind.
[01:07:40.000 --> 01:07:45.000]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[01:07:45.000 --> 01:07:51.000]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com. That's mysolarbackup.com.
[01:07:51.000 --> 01:07:59.000]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun, so go to mysolarbackup.com or call 1-877-327-0365.
[01:08:01.000 --> 01:08:07.000]  He's the T-Rex of political talk. Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:08:10.000 --> 01:08:16.000]  We got Max Kaiser popping in to talk about dollar plunge after Ewan called a ditch greenback.
[01:08:16.000 --> 01:08:21.000]  And what is going to mean when the dollar gets devalued? It's already being slowly devalued.
[01:08:21.000 --> 01:08:26.000]  And over time, it's what lost 97 plus percent of its value since 1913.
[01:08:26.000 --> 01:08:32.000]  But that last 3 percent, that's all we got, is the fact that worldwide, that's our main export.
[01:08:32.000 --> 01:08:39.000]  So the globalist will really, really have us under their thumb after this happens.
[01:08:39.000 --> 01:08:45.000]  And what incredible treason by the Federal Reserve to be at these meetings and calling for the end of the greenback.
[01:08:45.000 --> 01:08:52.000]  We actually have that clip and follow the Republic where Geithner gets asked about the basket of currencies
[01:08:52.000 --> 01:08:57.000]  and the new global currency, the SDR, and he says, yes, yes, we're moving towards that.
[01:08:57.000 --> 01:09:02.000]  The dollar dropped a few points just that day. But don't worry, people get confused by this.
[01:09:02.000 --> 01:09:06.000]  They go, well, I see the euro going down. I see the yin or the yang going down.
[01:09:06.000 --> 01:09:09.000]  I see the dollar going down together. They're all going down.
[01:09:09.000 --> 01:09:12.000]  One will go down this month. The next month, this one goes down.
[01:09:12.000 --> 01:09:15.000]  And then one will go back up a little bit. And then the other one will go back up a little bit.
[01:09:15.000 --> 01:09:20.000]  Then it drops again. But overall, the graph is down. Okay.
[01:09:20.000 --> 01:09:23.000]  And the globalists are operating in 25-year increments.
[01:09:23.000 --> 01:09:29.000]  We've been trained to operate in daily or weekly or monthly, maximum, hand to mouth.
[01:09:29.000 --> 01:09:35.000]  And so we're almost defenseless against this system until we realize it.
[01:09:35.000 --> 01:09:41.000]  We were talking to Erica in California. I wanted to have her finish up the story she was telling about her parents immigrating
[01:09:41.000 --> 01:09:47.000]  with her from Eastern Europe. And now she had family that was scooped up and never seen again
[01:09:47.000 --> 01:09:52.000]  by Stalin's NKVD and then others after Stalin, Khrushchev and others.
[01:09:52.000 --> 01:09:55.000]  And then we're going to go to other phone calls and get into some more news.
[01:09:55.000 --> 01:09:57.000]  But finish up your point, Erica.
[01:09:57.000 --> 01:10:02.000]  Well, I think the main point really is just, you know, the people that have sacked,
[01:10:02.000 --> 01:10:07.000]  my family sacrificed tremendous things to be able to be here in this country.
[01:10:07.000 --> 01:10:12.000]  I mean, we're talking literally escaping their homes with just the clothes on their backs and their kids in their arms.
[01:10:12.000 --> 01:10:18.000]  And, you know, the sacrifices they made to come here, the time it took, and then to, you know,
[01:10:18.000 --> 01:10:24.000]  I grew up with such an appreciation for what our country stood for and what, you know,
[01:10:24.000 --> 01:10:30.000]  this amazing holiday is coming up here. And it's just sad to me to see how people don't appreciate it.
[01:10:30.000 --> 01:10:34.000]  I think, you know, people have been in, you know, taking history class and they've learned sort of the basics.
[01:10:34.000 --> 01:10:39.000]  But, you know, I've learned firsthand from my family members really what went through their minds
[01:10:39.000 --> 01:10:45.000]  and what they endured. I mean, my dad to this day, you know, has nightmares and night terrors
[01:10:45.000 --> 01:10:49.000]  because, you know, he remembers bombs dropping around him and having to escape.
[01:10:49.000 --> 01:10:54.000]  And my mom was born in a bomb shelter. I mean, there's tons of stories of people just like my family
[01:10:54.000 --> 01:10:57.000]  who have sacrificed to come here. And I think, you know, every fourth of July,
[01:10:57.000 --> 01:11:01.000]  I mean, I believe people should retake the exam it takes to become a United States citizen.
[01:11:01.000 --> 01:11:06.000]  When I was a little girl, I watched my mom take that exam because she wanted to become a United States citizen.
[01:11:06.000 --> 01:11:11.000]  And she was learning all about our history and the Bill of Rights and what it means to be an American.
[01:11:11.000 --> 01:11:14.000]  And I believe everybody should revisit that as we get older.
[01:11:14.000 --> 01:11:16.000]  Absolutely, Erica.
[01:11:16.000 --> 01:11:21.000]  Erica, God bless you and I'm glad you're a listener. Keep spreading the word and we will defend this republic.
[01:11:21.000 --> 01:11:27.000]  And that's what's so insulting about it is that Mexico lost several wars with the United States.
[01:11:27.000 --> 01:11:34.000]  Mexico believes the Southwest belongs to it. Mexico is a joke failed state completely collapsed.
[01:11:34.000 --> 01:11:38.000]  And our government that's treacherous and treasonous because it's bought off.
[01:11:38.000 --> 01:11:43.000]  There's been a corporate takeover and the Mexican government teach in the schools in the U.S.
[01:11:43.000 --> 01:11:47.000]  and in Mexico that America is bad and Mexico is good.
[01:11:47.000 --> 01:11:52.000]  And the media teaches Hispanics that come here to keep their culture from whatever country they came from
[01:11:52.000 --> 01:11:54.000]  and to hate this country.
[01:11:54.000 --> 01:11:57.000]  Why would the government do that? Because the government is illegitimate.
[01:11:57.000 --> 01:12:01.000]  I'm going to say it again. Globalism is treason.
[01:12:01.000 --> 01:12:05.000]  Globalism is a corporate takeover.
[01:12:05.000 --> 01:12:09.000]  We don't have to worry about Russian spies, folks. We don't have to worry about Muslim terrorists.
[01:12:09.000 --> 01:12:11.000]  I mean, some of that exists.
[01:12:11.000 --> 01:12:19.000]  But comparatively, when you compare that to Goldman Sachs, J.P. Morgan Chase,
[01:12:19.000 --> 01:12:27.000]  these mega-massive global institutions that are openly selling trillions of derivatives to county and city and state governments
[01:12:27.000 --> 01:12:31.000]  knowing it would implode so they can then bankrupt them and take them over,
[01:12:31.000 --> 01:12:33.000]  knowing they brought down whole nations.
[01:12:33.000 --> 01:12:37.000]  I mean, we have the IMF World Bank documents from 2002 where this was all admitted.
[01:12:37.000 --> 01:12:44.000]  I've been warning you about the derivative takeover since then intensely telling you exactly what would happen.
[01:12:44.000 --> 01:12:53.000]  Don't toot our horn enough as patriots and break down the fact that we have laid out this radio show over a decade ago
[01:12:53.000 --> 01:12:58.000]  and intensely for at least eight years exactly what would happen.
[01:12:58.000 --> 01:13:04.000]  I mean, go back and watch my old films. Go back and read my book written eight and a half years ago.
[01:13:04.000 --> 01:13:13.000]  Go back and listen to MP3 files of my radio show from 14 years ago and video from my TV show 15 years ago.
[01:13:13.000 --> 01:13:15.000]  That's what I was talking about then.
[01:13:15.000 --> 01:13:19.000]  Bullhorning the capitol saying the banks are taking control of our currency
[01:13:19.000 --> 01:13:23.000]  and they're creating fiat currency and buying up all our infrastructure
[01:13:23.000 --> 01:13:27.000]  and they're selling toxic assets to governments.
[01:13:27.000 --> 01:13:31.000]  They're getting the stock market, the government to invest in the stock market
[01:13:31.000 --> 01:13:35.000]  and they're planning to implode at a key time and they're planning to take over the United States.
[01:13:35.000 --> 01:13:39.000]  Now we're going to burn this UN flag. This is your enemy.
[01:13:39.000 --> 01:13:44.000]  I mean, there's videos of that from me 14 years ago, 15 years ago,
[01:13:44.000 --> 01:13:49.000]  not because I'm a genius, but because I read what these people done in other countries.
[01:13:49.000 --> 01:13:51.000]  It's 100%.
[01:13:51.000 --> 01:13:54.000]  And I'm going to go back to your calls, but I want to briefly tell this story now.
[01:13:54.000 --> 01:13:58.000]  I was driving in this morning and there was some traffic.
[01:13:58.000 --> 01:14:07.000]  So I was in the car about 35, 40 minutes and I listened to talk radio, local, national, San Antonio, Dallas, Houston.
[01:14:07.000 --> 01:14:15.000]  I just have a practice of tuning through and listening about two, three minutes to maybe 10 stations.
[01:14:15.000 --> 01:14:20.000]  And it was, what are you going to barbecue this 4th of July?
[01:14:20.000 --> 01:14:23.000]  Obama's a commie.
[01:14:23.000 --> 01:14:26.000]  The Russian spies are going to get us.
[01:14:26.000 --> 01:14:33.000]  The oil spill on and on and on with really distractions.
[01:14:33.000 --> 01:14:42.000]  And I heard people calling in on two different shows on two different stations about what they're going to barbecue this 4th of July.
[01:14:42.000 --> 01:14:48.000]  And I talked to even friends and family and I'll say, you know, the dollars continuing to plunge.
[01:14:48.000 --> 01:14:52.000]  You know, they're devaluing all the currencies together so people don't notice as much.
[01:14:52.000 --> 01:14:55.000]  You know, they are getting ready for an attack on Iran.
[01:14:55.000 --> 01:15:02.000]  I mean, that's in the news today with all these government ministers and the G8 and others saying, yes, we're getting ready to hit Iran.
[01:15:02.000 --> 01:15:05.000]  The Bilderberg is giving the green light.
[01:15:05.000 --> 01:15:14.000]  And people are just, well, so what?
[01:15:14.000 --> 01:15:23.000]  There's almost just like a completely passive attitude towards this where folks just put up with it.
[01:15:23.000 --> 01:15:32.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, when populations let governments run wild, the very worst people in society will take over and you will get a World War One.
[01:15:32.000 --> 01:15:36.000]  You will get a World War Two, but a 21st century version.
[01:15:36.000 --> 01:15:38.000]  You will get knocks on the door.
[01:15:38.000 --> 01:15:40.000]  You will be drug away.
[01:15:40.000 --> 01:15:42.000]  I mean, that is what they're setting up.
[01:15:42.000 --> 01:15:44.000]  It's guaranteed.
[01:15:44.000 --> 01:15:45.000]  They want that.
[01:15:45.000 --> 01:15:49.000]  They want that savage psychopathic power turned loose.
[01:15:49.000 --> 01:15:56.000]  And they've militarized the police and brainwashed them that it's macho and cool to attack the public.
[01:15:56.000 --> 01:15:58.000]  And we're in trouble.
[01:15:58.000 --> 01:16:05.000]  And just on this Fourth of July, realize that, that what America is is dead.
[01:16:05.000 --> 01:16:13.000]  We may be able to resuscitate it, but that's going to take every one of you screaming bloody murder and really getting aggressive.
[01:16:13.000 --> 01:16:15.000]  The globalists are scared right now.
[01:16:15.000 --> 01:16:17.000]  They're reaching for the whole world.
[01:16:17.000 --> 01:16:18.000]  They've miscalculated.
[01:16:18.000 --> 01:16:19.000]  They know they're in trouble.
[01:16:19.000 --> 01:16:22.000]  That's why they've said they're in trouble and that they've got to accelerate their program.
[01:16:22.000 --> 01:16:24.000]  So we forced them off their time frame.
[01:16:24.000 --> 01:16:26.000]  We forced them to come out in the open.
[01:16:26.000 --> 01:16:30.000]  And so we're in the fight, but this is a fight of our lives.
[01:16:30.000 --> 01:16:31.000]  All right.
[01:16:31.000 --> 01:16:34.000]  I want to go to George, Mark, Derry, Chris, Kyle.
[01:16:34.000 --> 01:16:35.000]  We're going to get to all of you quickly.
[01:16:35.000 --> 01:16:36.000]  George in Texas.
[01:16:36.000 --> 01:16:37.000]  Thanks for holding.
[01:16:37.000 --> 01:16:39.000]  Thank you for taking my call, Alex.
[01:16:39.000 --> 01:16:40.000]  Thank you.
[01:16:40.000 --> 01:16:49.000]  Yes, I'm going to, when I think about the Fourth of July, I'm going to celebrate freedom of speech. I'm going to go to the fireworks event and read a Declaration of Independence out loud.
[01:16:49.000 --> 01:16:56.000]  And make sure when people go through those seatbelt checkpoints, they know what I'm talking about.
[01:16:56.000 --> 01:16:58.000]  Well, that's important to do.
[01:16:58.000 --> 01:17:05.000]  In fact, later in the broadcast, I'm going to read some passages from the Declaration of Independence when Bob Chapman is on with us.
[01:17:05.000 --> 01:17:12.000]  If you read that, that is sedition, that is terrorism, according to FEMA and Homeland Security today.
[01:17:12.000 --> 01:17:27.000]  And that's why I have FEMA on tape to police and firemen and medical people in Kansas City pre 911 demonizing the founding fathers and the Declaration of Independence, because that is a terrorist document to terrorist.
[01:17:27.000 --> 01:17:28.000]  George, anything else?
[01:17:28.000 --> 01:17:31.000]  Well, yeah, I put, I mean, I, I'm even on my website.
[01:17:31.000 --> 01:17:41.000]  I said, um, why we should remember the port for July just hope because I'm celebrating my freedom of speech of what our founders did because those signers, uh, it was no party for them.
[01:17:41.000 --> 01:17:43.000]  Use it or lose it.
[01:17:43.000 --> 01:17:45.000]  I appreciate your call.
[01:17:45.000 --> 01:17:56.000]  But the silver lining in all of this is at the end of the day, people are going to know why freedom special.
[01:17:56.000 --> 01:17:59.000]  They're going to know why we celebrate the fourth.
[01:17:59.000 --> 01:18:02.000]  A lot of people are already discovering that.
[01:18:02.000 --> 01:18:08.000]  But as the tyranny gets worse, people are now going to rediscover why freedom is the key to everything.
[01:18:08.000 --> 01:18:10.000]  Freedom is the engine of happiness.
[01:18:10.000 --> 01:18:11.000]  It is the engine of wealth.
[01:18:11.000 --> 01:18:16.000]  It is the engine of honor and independence and strength.
[01:18:16.000 --> 01:18:20.000]  Let's go to Derry listening in Tennessee on 1470 AM.
[01:18:20.000 --> 01:18:22.000]  Derry, you're on the air.
[01:18:22.000 --> 01:18:23.000]  Welcome.
[01:18:23.000 --> 01:18:25.000]  Hey, how are you doing, Alex?
[01:18:25.000 --> 01:18:26.000]  Good, sir.
[01:18:26.000 --> 01:18:27.000]  Welcome.
[01:18:27.000 --> 01:18:28.000]  Thank you very much.
[01:18:28.000 --> 01:18:33.000]  I just have one, uh, word for America right now and it's hope.
[01:18:33.000 --> 01:18:39.000]  Uh, for many years, uh, I was, uh, a Republican.
[01:18:39.000 --> 01:18:49.000]  Uh, I started voting under Ronald Reagan and then when, when Bob Doe got a letter when they nominated Bob Doe, I quit voting because I knew something was wrong.
[01:18:49.000 --> 01:18:50.000]  Yeah, they ran a corpse.
[01:18:50.000 --> 01:18:52.000]  They ran a corpse against Clinton.
[01:18:52.000 --> 01:18:53.000]  Yeah, evidently.
[01:18:53.000 --> 01:18:56.000]  But the other day I was in, uh, the flea market.
[01:18:56.000 --> 01:19:02.000]  And there was two people that were arguing about abortion and then they turned to me and they said, what do you think?
[01:19:02.000 --> 01:19:08.000]  And I said, well, to be quite frank with you, I don't think that it's a Supreme Court, uh, issue.
[01:19:08.000 --> 01:19:10.000]  And they looked at me and they said, why?
[01:19:10.000 --> 01:19:16.000]  And I said, I think it's the state's issue and if a state wants to vote that way, hey, try to vote it out.
[01:19:16.000 --> 01:19:18.000]  I said, I don't think it's a federal issue.
[01:19:18.000 --> 01:19:22.000]  This lady came up to me and she said, hey, uh, I have something to give you.
[01:19:22.000 --> 01:19:24.000]  And I said, well, what is it?
[01:19:24.000 --> 01:19:27.000]  And she goes, um, it's a pay to CD.
[01:19:27.000 --> 01:19:30.000]  And she handed it to me and it said, don't fret on me.
[01:19:30.000 --> 01:19:33.000]  And, uh, she goes, will you listen to it?
[01:19:33.000 --> 01:19:35.000]  And I said, well, yeah, I will.
[01:19:35.000 --> 01:19:37.000]  And she goes, have you ever heard of Alex Jones?
[01:19:37.000 --> 01:19:40.000]  And I said, no, no, I haven't.
[01:19:40.000 --> 01:19:44.000]  And, uh, she goes, uh, well, just play this tape and tell me what you think.
[01:19:44.000 --> 01:19:53.000]  I tell you what, stay there, stay there, uh, Derry, come back and finish your point because absolutely as we educate each other,
[01:19:53.000 --> 01:19:55.000]  you've got info I need, I've got info you need.
[01:19:55.000 --> 01:19:59.000]  We all raise our level of awareness together.
[01:19:59.000 --> 01:20:25.000]  We'll be back.
[01:20:29.000 --> 01:20:55.000]  We'll be back.
[01:20:55.000 --> 01:21:21.000]  We'll be back.
[01:21:21.000 --> 01:21:47.000]  We'll be back.
[01:21:47.000 --> 01:22:13.000]  We'll be back.
[01:22:13.000 --> 01:22:39.000]  We'll be back.
[01:22:39.000 --> 01:22:59.000]  We'll be back.
[01:22:59.000 --> 01:23:13.000]  You worry, but only because you're paying attention.
[01:23:13.000 --> 01:23:40.000]  You worry, but only because you're paying attention.
[01:23:40.000 --> 01:23:46.000]  So go to ofthefield.com or call toll-free 1-888-51-EAT-FREE and take that first step.
[01:23:46.000 --> 01:23:49.000]  Make your OASIS of food security and nutrition now.
[01:23:49.000 --> 01:23:55.000]  That's O-F-T-H-E-F-I-E-L-D.com or call 1-888-513-2837.
[01:23:55.000 --> 01:24:01.000]  Start now and make 2010 your year of independence.
[01:24:01.000 --> 01:24:11.000]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents The Alex Jones Show because there's a war on for your mind.
[01:24:11.000 --> 01:24:16.000]  I want to play a few minutes of peach, dark. This has been out for a couple days on infowars.com.
[01:24:16.000 --> 01:24:25.000]  This California congressman and the unbelievable arrogance by people at a town hall who just want to control our borders.
[01:24:25.000 --> 01:24:31.000]  You're a citizen, you've got a crooked toenail, they throw a book at you, but America is starting to collapse on the southwest.
[01:24:31.000 --> 01:24:36.000]  46 states are on the verge of bankruptcy according to Bloomberg.
[01:24:36.000 --> 01:24:41.000]  People are coming in having babies for free, everything paid for, citizens.
[01:24:41.000 --> 01:24:43.000]  Everything's disintegrating.
[01:24:43.000 --> 01:24:47.000]  And he just says, oh, you want to kill somebody. You're a minute man.
[01:24:47.000 --> 01:24:49.000]  You want a minute man if it killed anybody.
[01:24:49.000 --> 01:24:53.000]  It's just all arrogance out of these people.
[01:24:53.000 --> 01:24:58.000]  This is the face of incumbency, but I wanted to have Kyle in...
[01:24:58.000 --> 01:25:02.000]  No, Derry in Tennessee, listening to 1470 AM, finish up.
[01:25:02.000 --> 01:25:11.000]  So finish up your point. This lady gave you a copy of Don't Tread on me, a documentary we sell that I'm in on infowars.com, and continue.
[01:25:11.000 --> 01:25:17.000]  Well, anyhow, so she gave me the copy and she said, now promise me that you'll listen to it.
[01:25:17.000 --> 01:25:18.000]  And I said, I promise.
[01:25:18.000 --> 01:25:22.000]  And so I went home and me and my son put it on and we started watching it.
[01:25:22.000 --> 01:25:28.000]  And it was amazing. It was filled with all the things that you need to know about the Constitution.
[01:25:28.000 --> 01:25:33.000]  And I listened to CNN. I listened to Fox. I read newspapers.
[01:25:33.000 --> 01:25:40.000]  I try to keep up with everything, even though I quit voting because it was just based on lies.
[01:25:40.000 --> 01:25:51.000]  But you know something, Alex, in your life, when you hear important things about Christ for the first time, about what America was formed on,
[01:25:51.000 --> 01:25:58.000]  and when I heard your words, you know they're true in your heart.
[01:25:58.000 --> 01:26:07.000]  And something comes over you and you know that the person that is speaking the words is the truth. It's real.
[01:26:07.000 --> 01:26:15.000]  And when I heard it, I knew it was real, and then everything started clicking in and started making sense in my mind.
[01:26:15.000 --> 01:26:19.000]  And then I have followed you religiously, your show now, for a month.
[01:26:19.000 --> 01:26:24.000]  And I've listened to the finance and it makes sense what they're doing.
[01:26:24.000 --> 01:26:30.000]  You know, the world has been jealous of America because we have supported Israel and God blessed us for it.
[01:26:30.000 --> 01:26:35.000]  And all the different things that you're saying are making sense.
[01:26:35.000 --> 01:26:40.000]  Now, I don't believe in everything, but I'm sure that you don't believe in everything that someone else says.
[01:26:40.000 --> 01:26:46.000]  But so much that you say, 99% of it, you can tell in your heart.
[01:26:46.000 --> 01:26:50.000]  And that's why this movement, Alex, is growing.
[01:26:50.000 --> 01:26:57.000]  And you can't stop the truth because the news media, the politicians, whatever, try to brainwash us.
[01:26:57.000 --> 01:27:00.000]  Oh, those are conspiracy nuts and whatever.
[01:27:00.000 --> 01:27:11.000]  But what happens is once you listen to it, their lies fall and you know in your heart it's revealed to you that that's the truth.
[01:27:11.000 --> 01:27:15.000]  God is speaking to you in your heart and you'll say, I know.
[01:27:15.000 --> 01:27:21.000]  And that's why the system wants to start wars and economic collapses and why they want to keep that oil well leaking
[01:27:21.000 --> 01:27:27.000]  and block the ships from scooping up the oil so that the hurricanes can come in and drive it into land
[01:27:27.000 --> 01:27:30.000]  because they are in such desperate straits.
[01:27:30.000 --> 01:27:37.000]  All of their credibility is imploding so bad that they need huge distractions to divert the public.
[01:27:37.000 --> 01:27:46.000]  But I was just about to say before you said those eloquent words and true words that people are coming together
[01:27:46.000 --> 01:27:56.000]  and people know the truth when they hear it because subconsciously our minds are much more powerful than our conscious mind.
[01:27:56.000 --> 01:27:59.000]  And of course, it's also in the spirit as well with discernment.
[01:27:59.000 --> 01:28:01.000]  And that's why the system hates me so much.
[01:28:01.000 --> 01:28:03.000]  I'm not perfect, but I really try to tell the truth.
[01:28:03.000 --> 01:28:05.000]  I really try to get at the truth.
[01:28:05.000 --> 01:28:07.000]  I really try to do the best job I can.
[01:28:07.000 --> 01:28:09.000]  I make mistakes, but that's the difference.
[01:28:09.000 --> 01:28:11.000]  I'm trying to tell the truth.
[01:28:11.000 --> 01:28:13.000]  I'm trying to love God.
[01:28:13.000 --> 01:28:14.000]  I'm trying to be a good person.
[01:28:14.000 --> 01:28:16.000]  I'm trying to be pure.
[01:28:16.000 --> 01:28:19.000]  I'm trying to turn myself over to God to be a vessel of goodness.
[01:28:19.000 --> 01:28:25.000]  That doesn't mean I'm not worldly and the weakness of the flesh and the thorn in the side and all the rest of it.
[01:28:25.000 --> 01:28:30.000]  But at the end of the day, we are making the right choice.
[01:28:30.000 --> 01:28:31.000]  Our hearts are right.
[01:28:31.000 --> 01:28:39.000]  And so we're one group and those that love evil and love lies and love tyranny and just that's what their spirit is inclined to.
[01:28:39.000 --> 01:28:41.000]  That's what their psyche is inclined to.
[01:28:41.000 --> 01:28:42.000]  That is what they've chosen.
[01:28:42.000 --> 01:28:49.000]  But most people love God and deep down are good and they don't like the evil that's part of the human psyche.
[01:28:49.000 --> 01:28:52.000]  And they want to be good people.
[01:28:52.000 --> 01:28:53.000]  They want to have a good future.
[01:28:53.000 --> 01:28:56.000]  They want the blessings that come with doing the right thing.
[01:28:56.000 --> 01:28:58.000]  But freedom has to be fought for.
[01:28:58.000 --> 01:29:05.000]  And we are at a great crossroads right now and we are going into bondage just like Israel went into bondage.
[01:29:05.000 --> 01:29:10.000]  Every time they became evil, God turned them over to bondage and to foreign occupation.
[01:29:10.000 --> 01:29:16.000]  And we're occupied by offshore global corporate interest and globalism is treason.
[01:29:16.000 --> 01:29:21.000]  It is the overthrow of our nation, not by a country but by a corporate borg.
[01:29:21.000 --> 01:29:29.000]  And we are now discovering that and the system is panicking because they know that we know they're a pack of crooks.
[01:29:29.000 --> 01:29:30.000]  God bless you, sir.
[01:29:30.000 --> 01:29:34.000]  Go out and wake others up now and continue to move forward.
[01:29:34.000 --> 01:29:35.000]  We will save the Republic.
[01:29:35.000 --> 01:29:41.000]  We will get that reprieve like Nineveh if we trust in God and take action.
[01:29:41.000 --> 01:29:42.000]  We'll be back with Max Kaiser.
[01:29:42.000 --> 01:29:46.000]  More of your calls and I will get to that clip of this treacherous little congressman.
[01:29:46.000 --> 01:29:51.000]  InfoWars.com is the website. Stay with us.
[01:30:17.000 --> 01:30:24.000]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps now being expanded nationwide.
[01:30:24.000 --> 01:30:30.000]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an old powerful shadow state.
[01:30:30.000 --> 01:30:34.000]  At least state 4 chronicles the sickening depths to which our republic has fallen.
[01:30:34.000 --> 01:30:41.000]  Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship, body scanners, sound cameras, citizen spies,
[01:30:41.000 --> 01:30:48.000]  staged terror and cameras on every street corner. It's only the beginning of the new world order's hellish plan.
[01:30:48.000 --> 01:30:51.000]  The police state isn't coming. It's here.

[01:31:00.000 --> 01:31:03.000]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[01:31:03.000 --> 01:31:08.000]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[01:31:08.000 --> 01:31:15.000]  My answer would be all I can get. In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[01:31:15.000 --> 01:31:21.000]  How much do you want? When do you want it? Now or after the battle starts? When will you need it?
[01:31:21.000 --> 01:31:26.000]  Can you buy it without proper identification? Will there be any food? Will it make your children sick?
[01:31:26.000 --> 01:31:31.000]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[01:31:31.000 --> 01:31:34.000]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[01:31:34.000 --> 01:31:40.000]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life. How much will you need? We don't know.
[01:31:40.000 --> 01:31:43.000]  How much do you want? All you can get. I'm Alex Jones.
[01:31:43.000 --> 01:31:54.000]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day. Call 1-800-409-5633 or check it out on the web at efoodsdirect.com.
[01:31:54.000 --> 01:31:59.000]  Again, that number, 1-800-409-5633.

[01:33:47.000 --> 01:33:54.000]  One of the top stories on the Drudge Report right now. We appreciate Matt Drudge of DrudgeReport.com for that.
[01:33:54.000 --> 01:34:00.000]  We're now getting two or three top links a week and we just tip our hat to the courage of Matt Drudge.
[01:34:00.000 --> 01:34:04.000]  Very, very exciting how mainstream this information is becoming.
[01:34:04.000 --> 01:34:11.000]  But Drudge realizes that we've been on record for 15 years laying all this out and that we now have a more credibility than ever.
[01:34:11.000 --> 01:34:17.000]  So does Max Kaiser, Gerald Salente and others that we routinely interview. We're going to Max Kaiser here in just a moment.
[01:34:17.000 --> 01:34:22.000]  But before I go any further, I want to tell you about mysolarbackup.com.
[01:34:22.000 --> 01:34:28.000]  That's one word, mysolarbackup.com. Have you lost your power and simply wanted to simply flip the switch to get the lights back on?
[01:34:28.000 --> 01:34:35.000]  If so, you should check out mysolarbackup.com because there's never been a better time to start getting off the grid and generate your own supply of electrical power.
[01:34:35.000 --> 01:34:41.000]  You can run a little work shed or your garage. It's great for camping. Get several of the units, run your old house.
[01:34:41.000 --> 01:34:50.000]  It's great during brownouts, ice storms, hurricanes, or if you just want to stop paying the sickening carbon taxes that they're starting to levy on top of our electricity.
[01:34:50.000 --> 01:34:57.000]  New Zealand just passed it and their energy prices went up by 5% in two days and it's estimated to go up 20%.
[01:34:57.000 --> 01:35:03.000]  The point is the global stinkers don't own the sun yet, so start moving off the grid today.
[01:35:03.000 --> 01:35:14.000]  Give them a call at 877-327-0365 to get a free information package or order at 877-327-0365 or mysolarbackup.com.
[01:35:14.000 --> 01:35:18.000]  And of course, a wonderful sponsor. It's not enough to just filter the water you drink.
[01:35:18.000 --> 01:35:24.000]  You bathe in the sodium fluoride and the mercury and the lead and the other Grand Meard reagents that they dump directly into the water.
[01:35:24.000 --> 01:35:30.000]  That's where they get rid of the toxic waste from.
[01:35:30.000 --> 01:35:35.000]  Aluminum production. So I want to tell you about PureWaterFreedom.com.
[01:35:35.000 --> 01:35:42.000]  They have whole house filters, great in-house filters. They have them for your water, for your bathtub, your shower, your washing machines.
[01:35:42.000 --> 01:35:48.000]  They have it all from the inexpensive to the grand. It's all there at PureWaterFreedom.com.
[01:35:48.000 --> 01:35:55.000]  PureWaterFreedom.com. They're patriots and most importantly, it's all made in the United States of America while it's still here.
[01:35:55.000 --> 01:36:06.000]  PureWaterFreedom.com. If you love America and love our industry, what's left of it, the skeleton that's left, you better start supporting American companies, PureWaterFreedom.com.
[01:36:06.000 --> 01:36:14.000]  Okay, ladies and gentlemen, let us now go to the one, the only, Max Kaiser joining us from Paris, France.
[01:36:14.000 --> 01:36:17.000]  He, of course, is the inventor of the Hollywood Stock Exchange system.
[01:36:17.000 --> 01:36:25.000]  He, of course, also is a retired former top broker and he is a TV host and columnist.
[01:36:25.000 --> 01:36:35.000]  And he joins us because I thought in the last few days we got to get Kaiser on to give us his take on dollar plunges after UN call to ditch the greenback.
[01:36:35.000 --> 01:36:42.000]  That's what AP Reuters seeing in all said. The answer to the depression, they're now admitting it's going to be a depression, been in one for two years,
[01:36:42.000 --> 01:36:49.000]  is we'll give the very banks that sold us tens of trillions in derivatives and are above the law and won't tell Congress where the money is.
[01:36:49.000 --> 01:36:57.000]  We'll let them have a global government we pay taxes to, Max, and then all our currencies will be denominated and they'll be able to manipulate things even more.
[01:36:57.000 --> 01:37:05.000]  So I thought we'd get you on as a former insider who really understands how this works to talk about this new system.
[01:37:05.000 --> 01:37:07.000]  Break it down for us, Max Kaiser.
[01:37:07.000 --> 01:37:16.000]  Well, it should be no secret to the people listening to your show and the guests that you have brought on to your show have made this point over the past few years.
[01:37:16.000 --> 01:37:33.000]  And the issuance of a new global currency is really a fate complete because the need for all the banks to re-securitize and repackage all that bad debt
[01:37:33.000 --> 01:37:41.000]  and put it into some new entity, some new global bank as a way to two benefits to this.
[01:37:41.000 --> 01:37:45.000]  Number one, all the bankers get another fee for having repackaged all the bad debt.
[01:37:45.000 --> 01:37:56.000]  And number two, they get to push the liability when, you know, the day of reckoning down the ticket can down the road hopefully a few months or a year or two.
[01:37:56.000 --> 01:38:05.000]  But they're willing to sacrifice America's sovereignty as an independent nation to get this goal accomplished.
[01:38:05.000 --> 01:38:17.000]  And this is a huge problem because you've got the banks on Wall Street who are acting in ways that are not consistent with what's in the interest of all Americans from coast to coast.
[01:38:17.000 --> 01:38:20.000]  They're acting at cross purposes to America.
[01:38:20.000 --> 01:38:36.000]  Now, let me point your direction to something on Bloomberg. July 1, Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke and New York Fed Timothy Geiter told senators on April 3, 2008,
[01:38:36.000 --> 01:38:43.000]  that the tens of billions of dollars in assets the government agreed to purchase in the rescue of Bear Stearns were, quote, investment grade.
[01:38:43.000 --> 01:38:53.000]  What we just discovered today, or in the last couple of days, is what these things that they put on the balance sheet of the Federal Reserve were not investment grade.
[01:38:53.000 --> 01:38:59.000]  They were not even junk. They were pure trash, pure garbage.
[01:38:59.000 --> 01:39:15.000]  They gave the Federal Reserve Bank, which is essentially at this point the People's Bank, pure garbage in exchange for treasury bills that they use to pay themselves those huge bonuses in 2008 and 2009 and 2010.
[01:39:15.000 --> 01:39:21.000]  It's an act of pure, you know, it's illegal. Of course it's illegal.
[01:39:21.000 --> 01:39:30.000]  You're not allowed, the Federal Reserve is not allowed to make loans, unsecured loans. And when the banks gave them paper, that was worthless.
[01:39:30.000 --> 01:39:42.000]  It had no value whatsoever. They just had a notation on a piece of paper saying something like, what are they called? Here's what they called it.
[01:39:42.000 --> 01:39:48.000]  They called it HG-COL Limited. That's all said on a piece of paper.
[01:39:48.000 --> 01:39:51.000]  For that, the Federal Reserve gave them 10, 20, 30 million dollars.
[01:39:51.000 --> 01:40:04.000]  This is just total bank robbing, and now Bloomberg comes out and the government admits that all the major big Federal Reserve holding banks, you know, the big six, are knee-deep in hundreds of billions of narcotics money knowingly.
[01:40:04.000 --> 01:40:07.000]  Now, that's not news to us, but this is now admitted.
[01:40:07.000 --> 01:40:23.000]  And they're also coming out and admitting that it's 600 trillion in derivatives in the Washington Post and that the financial re-regulation package actually gives the Federal Reserve total control over all the other banks so they can rob real local banks and credit unions.
[01:40:23.000 --> 01:40:28.000]  And so they can also take control of any institution that affects the economy.
[01:40:28.000 --> 01:40:38.000]  So we're seeing a total banking dictatorship. It's like you robbed everyone and make Madoff look like a saint. We're going to give you god-like power. That will teach you.
[01:40:38.000 --> 01:40:46.000]  Well, I'll tell you what's going on in France, and this will give you something that you haven't heard from anybody else. This is something happening right here in France.
[01:40:46.000 --> 01:40:56.000]  The French government, of course, is trying to get rid of Goldman Sachs as are other governments in Europe because they have anti-terrorist laws and these banks are acting as terrorists.
[01:40:56.000 --> 01:41:05.000]  So what they're doing is they're introducing new laws and they're trying to get rid of Goldman Sachs by introducing new financial obscenity laws.
[01:41:05.000 --> 01:41:14.000]  So in other words, instead of trying to legally build the case that Goldman Sachs should leave the country because they're breaking the law, it doesn't seem that's enough.
[01:41:14.000 --> 01:41:25.000]  The public doesn't seem to mind if they're breaking the law. The fact that they're committing acts of moral outrage, again, the public doesn't seem really concerned that the bank is committing acts of moral outrage.
[01:41:25.000 --> 01:41:34.000]  So in the French courts right now, they're trying to introduce a new concept called financial obscenity, where they equate the actions of Goldman Sachs and JP Morgan to kitty porn.
[01:41:34.000 --> 01:41:40.000]  And they say these guys are kitty pornographers, in a sense, they're financial pornographers.
[01:41:40.000 --> 01:41:48.000]  And the reason that they're going down this path is they made the observation that in America two things are quite sacred, freedom of speech and private property.
[01:41:48.000 --> 01:41:58.000]  And they noticed that on the freedom of speech route, the way that a lot of these corporations are able to bypass the freedom of speech laws were to make things obscene.
[01:41:58.000 --> 01:42:04.000]  So they said, well, for example, they're trying to shut down the internet because they are trying to protect you from quote unquote obscenity.
[01:42:04.000 --> 01:42:07.000]  So the anti obscenity laws are very, very powerful.
[01:42:07.000 --> 01:42:20.000]  So in the French government right now, what they're trying to do is to make a case for financial obscenity saying Lord Blankfein has the equivalent of a kitty pornographer and that he should be gone to go to jail as such.
[01:42:20.000 --> 01:42:35.000]  And so this is a new concept in Europe because they're infested with banking vermin down in Greece, in Ireland, in Iceland, the banking vermin, the Goldman Sachs, the JP Morgan, the cockroaches that have come in and totally destroyed the economy here in Europe.
[01:42:35.000 --> 01:42:42.000]  They can't get rid of them. The laws aren't strong enough to get rid of this plague of banking.
[01:42:42.000 --> 01:42:44.000]  Well, Max, I want to talk more about that.
[01:42:44.000 --> 01:42:52.000]  I mean, I want to talk more about that and this is profound what you're talking about, but you're influential on the continent of Europe.
[01:42:52.000 --> 01:43:01.000]  You're influential here in the U.S., but very influential all over the biggest TV and radio stations there, national French TV, national Greek TV.
[01:43:01.000 --> 01:43:18.000]  And so you are having a big effect. I would have you recommend that people go after the central bankers this way because this is the most profound information I have to basically give to the public.
[01:43:18.000 --> 01:43:22.000]  And it's something that's hidden in plain view. You've talked about it. I've talked about it.
[01:43:22.000 --> 01:43:34.000]  I want us to take a deep breath in this spectrum of obscenity and corruption and just stuff that's so off the chart criminal, you know, banking heads saying, we won't tell you where trillions of taxpayer money went.
[01:43:34.000 --> 01:43:38.000]  We're just not going to tell you in the congressman or so. Castrated, they say, yes, sir.
[01:43:38.000 --> 01:43:46.000]  I mean, this is a level of just absurdity that it's almost like a spell or under, but let me break the spell this way.
[01:43:46.000 --> 01:43:57.000]  And so after these banks is this way. They are basically foreign private corporate international pirates bigger financially than anyone government in the world.
[01:43:57.000 --> 01:44:03.000]  They've created tens of trillions. We're really thousands of trillions in fiat toxic weaponry.
[01:44:03.000 --> 01:44:11.000]  And we're worried about 11 Russian spies who tried to infiltrate Harvard and Wall Street because that's who's hijacked America.
[01:44:11.000 --> 01:44:16.000]  You don't infiltrate Congress. You don't infiltrate the State Department because they're just little political whores that follow orders.
[01:44:16.000 --> 01:44:24.000]  You infiltrate the Ivy League crux. So yes, those are Russian spies, obviously, but the point is they didn't infiltrate the government because we don't have a government.
[01:44:24.000 --> 01:44:34.000]  And I want this to really boil in. Globalism is the international lawlessness of these globalists legalized by them.
[01:44:34.000 --> 01:44:48.000]  And so what they are is foreign espionage, corporate takeover spies, and they should all be arrested for sedition and for espionage trying to overthrow our countries and hand our money supplies over to their new global government.
[01:44:48.000 --> 01:44:55.000]  I mean, it's so elementary. It's so hidden in plain view. That's how you go after them. This is espionage.
[01:44:55.000 --> 01:45:00.000]  They have come in and taken over our governments and they have taken over the Greece government.
[01:45:00.000 --> 01:45:09.000]  They've taken over the Spanish government and they're not going to give us quarter and they're a bunch of arrogant Eddie Haskell bastards and it's either us or them.
[01:45:09.000 --> 01:45:17.000]  Now, now, Max, what about that mindset really beating the drum that this is a corporate hostile takeover and it is espionage?
[01:45:17.000 --> 01:45:22.000]  It is financial terrorism. As you've said, we're being conquered.
[01:45:22.000 --> 01:45:34.000]  I don't think it's a bad route to take. I would add also the idea of racketeering. You know, that's one thing sorely missing from the prosecution of these guys.
[01:45:34.000 --> 01:45:41.000]  Because the raiding aid is easy. Investment banks and the fund managers and the banks on Wall Street are colluding.
[01:45:41.000 --> 01:45:51.000]  They have a racket and just like Al Capone was taken down, his racket eventually was taken down, this racket has to be taken down.
[01:45:51.000 --> 01:45:58.000]  The Goldman Sachs folks are engaged in racketeering. There are anti-racketeering laws on the books.
[01:45:58.000 --> 01:46:06.000]  It's what, if you recall, Giuliani when he was still running the courts in New York City, he went after Drexel Burnham using these laws.
[01:46:06.000 --> 01:46:17.000]  And you had also the recent, you know, Elliot Spitzer was the sheriff of Wall Street. He was building a case, anti-racketeering case.
[01:46:17.000 --> 01:46:25.000]  It's a very powerful way to go after these guys. And unfortunately, there's nobody in politics or in the legal system in the U.S.
[01:46:25.000 --> 01:46:31.000]  that is independent enough to simply take the laws that are on the books against racketeering.
[01:46:31.000 --> 01:46:41.000]  And clearly, it is a case of racketeering. When the Moody's Investment Agency downgrades the debt of Greece, the day after there's a huge sell-off in the Greek debt
[01:46:41.000 --> 01:46:50.000]  of the hedge funds that Moody's is friendly with, that's a racket. That is not to be condoned in a free market system.
[01:46:50.000 --> 01:46:52.000]  So it's, the case should be cut and dropped.
[01:46:52.000 --> 01:46:53.000]  Exactly.
[01:46:53.000 --> 01:46:55.000]  It will not stand up and make that case.
[01:46:55.000 --> 01:47:00.000]  And we've got Republicans saying, this is corporations, this is free market. It's sacrosanct.
[01:47:00.000 --> 01:47:08.000]  We've got the Democrats bought off by the same interest, lying saying they're bringing him to heel and, you know, trying to stop this.
[01:47:08.000 --> 01:47:13.000]  When none of that's happening, the corruption and the hubris is only accelerating.
[01:47:13.000 --> 01:47:22.000]  And meanwhile, people are so scared of a Chinese or a Russian spy and, oh, they're so afraid of an al-Qaeda-turbaned brown man.
[01:47:22.000 --> 01:47:35.000]  But when the real threat is these guys in $5,000 suits with Harvard, you know, business school degrees, how do we get the public to realize that in the 21st century,
[01:47:35.000 --> 01:47:40.000]  it's corporate takeovers, it's corporate espionage, trumping governments.
[01:47:40.000 --> 01:47:44.000]  How do we get them to understand that this is life and death?
[01:47:44.000 --> 01:47:47.000]  A, and then B, where do you see this going?
[01:47:47.000 --> 01:47:52.000]  Because the bankers only seem to show more hubris. It's like they're completely insane.
[01:47:52.000 --> 01:48:04.000]  I'm so sick of the 9-11 crybabies who are whinging over what, in retrospect, is a minor event in terms of property and loss of life.
[01:48:04.000 --> 01:48:09.000]  When you compare to the outrageous financial terrorism of Goldman Sachs and J.P. Morgan,
[01:48:09.000 --> 01:48:17.000]  the people who are living in tents all over America now are the direct result of the wealth that they confiscated,
[01:48:17.000 --> 01:48:25.000]  and as a result of them co-opting the system in ways that they were able to make riskless bets and make unlimited amounts of money.
[01:48:25.000 --> 01:48:28.000]  And any time they make a loss, they simply dump it into the public domain.
[01:48:28.000 --> 01:48:35.000]  And oh, oh, by the way, there's another 125,000 unemployed this month, and the unemployment benefits are not going to be continued.
[01:48:35.000 --> 01:48:39.000]  And the unemployment rate, the U6, the actual number is over 20%.
[01:48:39.000 --> 01:48:45.000]  And the average guy, the CEO of Walmart makes, let me put this,
[01:48:45.000 --> 01:48:55.000]  the average CEO of Walmart makes in one hour what the average employee at Walmart makes in one year.
[01:48:55.000 --> 01:48:59.000]  One hour he makes what the average worker makes in one year.
[01:48:59.000 --> 01:49:07.000]  Now, this is all basically engineered by totally destroying the fundamental supply-and-demand capitalist system
[01:49:07.000 --> 01:49:16.000]  that was in place before the Federal Reserve took over in 1913 and introduced the income tax to pay for all that debt and interest cost, etc.
[01:49:16.000 --> 01:49:23.000]  And it's perfect. They destroy capitalism and then blame what they've done on capitalism.
[01:49:23.000 --> 01:49:25.000]  It's insane.
[01:49:25.000 --> 01:49:30.000]  Well, as a couple of your guests have pointed out, the capitalism is not the problem here.
[01:49:30.000 --> 01:49:35.000]  The problem is that the folks are not obeying the laws.
[01:49:35.000 --> 01:49:42.000]  You say that the situation is getting worse, and it is getting worse because they keep making more money,
[01:49:42.000 --> 01:49:45.000]  and they use that money to finance more deregulation.
[01:49:45.000 --> 01:49:48.000]  The finance reform bill, as it's called, is a joke.
[01:49:48.000 --> 01:49:53.000]  It doesn't reform anything. It may come into effect many years down the road,
[01:49:53.000 --> 01:49:59.000]  and if anything, it just provides additional cover for more of this wealth confiscation that's going on.
[01:49:59.000 --> 01:50:03.000]  And the result is what I call two paths.
[01:50:03.000 --> 01:50:09.000]  One is the neo feudalism, where you're back to the middle ages of lords and serfs.
[01:50:09.000 --> 01:50:12.000]  The creditors are an indentured servant.
[01:50:12.000 --> 01:50:17.000]  And then the other path, of course, I've talked to you about it, is what I call the casino gulag.
[01:50:17.000 --> 01:50:22.000]  And on that front, I just noticed that in Australia, they've introduced, there's some outrage,
[01:50:22.000 --> 01:50:26.000]  because a company has introduced plastic credit card toys for babies.
[01:50:26.000 --> 01:50:31.000]  Babies hooked on credit cards and introduced them to credit cards.
[01:50:31.000 --> 01:50:35.000]  And I've been saying this for quite some time that the whole credit card companies won't stop
[01:50:35.000 --> 01:50:39.000]  until they'll feed credit card information through the umbilical cord into the womb
[01:50:39.000 --> 01:50:41.000]  to get fetuses hooked on credit cards.
[01:50:41.000 --> 01:50:43.000]  I'll tell you what, Max Kaiser, MaxKaiser.com.

[02:06:00.000 --> 02:06:02.000]  Hello friends, this is Alex Jones.
[02:06:02.000 --> 02:06:05.000]  You've heard me talk about Calvin 5 Star Soaps for years.

[02:06:08.000 --> 02:06:11.000]  and compares to nothing you will find in stores.

[02:06:14.000 --> 02:06:17.000]  Check them out on the web at 5starsoap.com

[02:06:20.000 --> 02:06:22.000]  Take my word for it.
[02:06:22.000 --> 02:06:24.000]  Once you've used pure soap, you won't buy anything else.
[02:06:24.000 --> 02:06:28.000]  Since 1947, Calvin Soap Company has been showing consumers
[02:06:28.000 --> 02:06:31.000]  that soap can be tough on dirt and gentle on the environment.

[02:06:39.000 --> 02:06:41.000]  Well Marty, what do you have to say?
[02:06:41.000 --> 02:06:44.000]  As founder and owner for over 63 years,
[02:06:44.000 --> 02:06:49.000]  satisfaction is guaranteed on W-Dirtback.

[02:06:55.000 --> 02:07:00.000]  and visit our website 5starsoap.com. Thank you.
[02:07:00.000 --> 02:07:03.000]  The question is, where should the American people
[02:07:03.000 --> 02:07:05.000]  draw their line in the sand?
[02:07:05.000 --> 02:07:06.000]  What have we got?
[02:07:06.000 --> 02:07:08.000]  A republic or a monarchy?
[02:07:08.000 --> 02:07:12.000]  A republic is based on a constitution which protects minority rights.
[02:07:12.000 --> 02:07:14.000]  Not democracy, not mob rule.
[02:07:14.000 --> 02:07:16.000]  Two wolves and a sheep voting on what's for dinner.
[02:07:16.000 --> 02:07:19.000]  So they think they own our land, they think they own our water,
[02:07:19.000 --> 02:07:22.000]  children, our education, our money.
[02:07:22.000 --> 02:07:26.000]  We have to define who we are and what we will tolerate.
[02:07:26.000 --> 02:07:28.000]  Somebody is going to ask you what you did
[02:07:28.000 --> 02:07:30.000]  during the Patriot uprising.
[02:07:30.000 --> 02:07:31.000]  You have been warned.
[02:07:31.000 --> 02:07:32.000]  We have the facts.
[02:07:32.000 --> 02:07:33.000]  We have the constitution.
[02:07:33.000 --> 02:07:34.000]  We have the Bill of Rights.
[02:07:34.000 --> 02:07:35.000]  We have common law.
[02:07:35.000 --> 02:07:37.000]  Knowledge is our, ladies and gentlemen,
[02:07:37.000 --> 02:07:39.000]  and I'm so excited to be able to offer you
[02:07:39.000 --> 02:07:41.000]  Don't Tread on Me, Rise of the Republic.
[02:07:41.000 --> 02:07:44.000]  Tyranny is upon us, but liberty and the sleeping giant
[02:07:44.000 --> 02:07:46.000]  that is the American people is rising.
[02:07:46.000 --> 02:07:48.000]  A new tool in the info war.
[02:07:48.000 --> 02:07:51.000]  Don't Tread on Me. Order it at infowars.com
[02:07:51.000 --> 02:07:56.000]  or prisonplanet.com or call toll free 888-253-3139
[02:07:56.000 --> 02:08:22.000]  and support independent patriotic liberty films.
[02:08:22.000 --> 02:08:27.000]  The Wall Street Journal marveled two days ago saying,
[02:08:27.000 --> 02:08:31.000]  this is the most unconventional spies we've ever seen.
[02:08:31.000 --> 02:08:34.000]  Good looking women trying to get into Wall Street,
[02:08:34.000 --> 02:08:36.000]  people infiltrating Harvard,
[02:08:36.000 --> 02:08:39.000]  infiltrating social network sites.
[02:08:39.000 --> 02:08:41.000]  I mean, this was clearly a sleeper cell.
[02:08:41.000 --> 02:08:44.000]  Fake names, illegally here, married.
[02:08:44.000 --> 02:08:45.000]  They're spies, okay?
[02:08:45.000 --> 02:08:47.000]  Unless that's all a hoax.
[02:08:47.000 --> 02:08:49.000]  And we did see the FBI hoax about Hatari
[02:08:49.000 --> 02:08:52.000]  and they've been ordered released and then the feds
[02:08:52.000 --> 02:08:55.000]  tried to block that and that got trumped again
[02:08:55.000 --> 02:08:57.000]  and so that appeal got defeated.
[02:08:57.000 --> 02:09:01.000]  So it may be a hoax, but that redhead is supermodel beautiful
[02:09:01.000 --> 02:09:05.000]  and they are here illegally and they are spies.
[02:09:05.000 --> 02:09:07.000]  I mean, all the evidence shows that,
[02:09:07.000 --> 02:09:09.000]  but it's very interesting that you have spies
[02:09:09.000 --> 02:09:11.000]  infiltrating Wall Street.
[02:09:11.000 --> 02:09:14.000]  If you study what the British did 100 years ago
[02:09:14.000 --> 02:09:19.000]  in CFR around 80 years ago, what, 1924,
[02:09:19.000 --> 02:09:24.000]  was they infiltrated New York and the robber barons
[02:09:24.000 --> 02:09:27.000]  and had British wealth and their robber barons
[02:09:27.000 --> 02:09:31.000]  married with our robber barons in the two-part history
[02:09:31.000 --> 02:09:34.000]  of the English-speaking peoples,
[02:09:34.000 --> 02:09:37.000]  which I've read by the way, incredible by Winston Churchill.
[02:09:37.000 --> 02:09:38.000]  He admits all this, okay?
[02:09:38.000 --> 02:09:41.000]  The British brag they took America back over.
[02:09:41.000 --> 02:09:42.000]  It's more of a merger.
[02:09:42.000 --> 02:09:43.000]  It's kind of like a marriage.
[02:09:43.000 --> 02:09:44.000]  In fact, that's how they describe it.
[02:09:44.000 --> 02:09:47.000]  So wouldn't they take over that they moved in together again?
[02:09:47.000 --> 02:09:49.000]  Of course, Churchill was half American
[02:09:49.000 --> 02:09:53.000]  and the other half royal with the Duke of Marlborough.
[02:09:53.000 --> 02:09:55.000]  Famous footage we've got of Churchill
[02:09:55.000 --> 02:09:57.000]  and his wife actually going to a meeting
[02:09:57.000 --> 02:09:58.000]  with the Queen wearing crowns.
[02:09:58.000 --> 02:09:59.000]  Because back in the old days,
[02:09:59.000 --> 02:10:01.000]  royalty was still wearing their little sub-crowns
[02:10:01.000 --> 02:10:03.000]  to go meet with the Queen.
[02:10:03.000 --> 02:10:06.000]  But I'm going to talk to Bob Chapman
[02:10:06.000 --> 02:10:08.000]  because he was in U.S. intelligence,
[02:10:08.000 --> 02:10:10.000]  Army intelligence assigned to,
[02:10:10.000 --> 02:10:12.000]  well, we won't get into the agency,
[02:10:12.000 --> 02:10:14.000]  up against the Ruskies.
[02:10:14.000 --> 02:10:16.000]  And the media is saying this is a new type of spying.
[02:10:16.000 --> 02:10:17.000]  No, it's not.
[02:10:17.000 --> 02:10:19.000]  This is real spying, okay?
[02:10:19.000 --> 02:10:21.000]  Most spying is economic espionage.
[02:10:21.000 --> 02:10:24.000]  And it just shows the Russians know what to infiltrate.
[02:10:24.000 --> 02:10:26.000]  The Congress is a rubber stamp,
[02:10:26.000 --> 02:10:29.000]  a bunch of whores that don't read 94% of the bills.
[02:10:29.000 --> 02:10:30.000]  The treason is corporate.
[02:10:30.000 --> 02:10:33.000]  Globalism is a corporate takeover, okay?
[02:10:33.000 --> 02:10:35.000]  It's corporate espionage.
[02:10:35.000 --> 02:10:37.000]  So while we're afraid of the Ruskies,
[02:10:37.000 --> 02:10:38.000]  and they could be a threat,
[02:10:38.000 --> 02:10:40.000]  China's much bigger,
[02:10:40.000 --> 02:10:42.000]  3,000 plus admitted front companies,
[02:10:42.000 --> 02:10:44.000]  totally infiltrating us,
[02:10:44.000 --> 02:10:46.000]  our government sold us out and deindustrialized us.
[02:10:46.000 --> 02:10:48.000]  We're going to talk to Bob Chapman about that,
[02:10:48.000 --> 02:10:50.000]  but Max wanted to say some kind words about Bob
[02:10:50.000 --> 02:10:52.000]  and explain that cookie thing.
[02:10:52.000 --> 02:10:54.000]  Now I know he plugs a cookie shop
[02:10:54.000 --> 02:10:56.000]  down the street from him in Paris,
[02:10:56.000 --> 02:10:58.000]  and they get thousands of emails every time he plugs him,
[02:10:58.000 --> 02:11:00.000]  and then he gets a free cookie.
[02:11:00.000 --> 02:11:03.000]  Now, I tell you, that is some expensive cookie there.
[02:11:03.000 --> 02:11:05.000]  I mean, a plug on this show
[02:11:05.000 --> 02:11:07.000]  is probably worth about $1,000.
[02:11:07.000 --> 02:11:08.000]  And that's fine, Max,
[02:11:08.000 --> 02:11:10.000]  but if you want to spend your plugs that way
[02:11:10.000 --> 02:11:12.000]  without saying MaxKaiser.com,
[02:11:12.000 --> 02:11:14.000]  then you can go ahead and plug the cookies.
[02:11:14.000 --> 02:11:16.000]  But I hope you're getting more than one cookie.
[02:11:16.000 --> 02:11:18.000]  Tell us about your favorite cookie place.
[02:11:18.000 --> 02:11:21.000]  Yeah, thesugarplumcakeshop.com
[02:11:21.000 --> 02:11:23.000]  down the street from where I live.
[02:11:23.000 --> 02:11:25.000]  The new bakery in my neighborhood
[02:11:25.000 --> 02:11:27.000]  run by these three women.
[02:11:27.000 --> 02:11:30.000]  Very, very attractive, cute, perky women.
[02:11:30.000 --> 02:11:32.000]  So that's what's happening is
[02:11:32.000 --> 02:11:34.000]  you're actually hitting on the women right now.
[02:11:34.000 --> 02:11:36.000]  Basically, yeah.
[02:11:36.000 --> 02:11:39.000]  So, I mean, you pay five dollars
[02:11:39.000 --> 02:11:42.000]  at sugarplumcakeshop.com,
[02:11:42.000 --> 02:11:45.000]  and I'll be sure to get a cookie.
[02:11:45.000 --> 02:11:48.000]  Okay, this is part of the brainiacs
[02:11:48.000 --> 02:11:50.000]  like to screw around with funny jokes,
[02:11:50.000 --> 02:11:54.000]  and I've noticed that the eccentric types do that.
[02:11:54.000 --> 02:11:56.000]  I'm eccentric myself at some levels,
[02:11:56.000 --> 02:11:59.000]  but you're now basically prostituting people
[02:11:59.000 --> 02:12:01.000]  to worship the women over there,
[02:12:01.000 --> 02:12:02.000]  but that's fine.
[02:12:02.000 --> 02:12:04.000]  I hope people buy you some cookies.
[02:12:04.000 --> 02:12:06.000]  Max Kaiser, we'll see you again in a few weeks.
[02:12:06.000 --> 02:12:07.000]  Thanks for joining us.
[02:12:07.000 --> 02:12:08.000]  Thanks, Alex.
[02:12:08.000 --> 02:12:09.000]  You bet. Take care.
[02:12:09.000 --> 02:12:11.000]  Maybe there's Russian spies over there.
[02:12:11.000 --> 02:12:12.000]  No, I'm being sarcastic.
[02:12:12.000 --> 02:12:14.000]  Okay, let's get serious.
[02:12:14.000 --> 02:12:16.000]  Let's go to Bob Chapman,
[02:12:16.000 --> 02:12:18.000]  who had the biggest newsletter in the financial newsletter
[02:12:18.000 --> 02:12:21.000]  in the world until he retired more than a decade ago.
[02:12:21.000 --> 02:12:23.000]  Of course, the biggest private silver and gold broker.
[02:12:23.000 --> 02:12:24.000]  He's lived all over the world.
[02:12:24.000 --> 02:12:26.000]  South Africa, France, Germany, you name it.
[02:12:26.000 --> 02:12:29.000]  And, you know, during the break,
[02:12:29.000 --> 02:12:30.000]  we forgot to get the plug.
[02:12:30.000 --> 02:12:32.000]  Max was telling me how for decades
[02:12:32.000 --> 02:12:35.000]  he's been reading what Bob Chapman has to say.
[02:12:35.000 --> 02:12:38.000]  So there's another nomination for Bob
[02:12:38.000 --> 02:12:40.000]  as being one of the best experts
[02:12:40.000 --> 02:12:42.000]  and trans forecasters out there,
[02:12:42.000 --> 02:12:43.000]  especially on the markets.
[02:12:43.000 --> 02:12:45.000]  So we have a lot to talk about with him today,
[02:12:45.000 --> 02:12:47.000]  with the dollar plunge after you
[02:12:47.000 --> 02:12:49.000]  and called a ditch greenback and a lot more.
[02:12:49.000 --> 02:12:52.000]  But first, Bob, you heard me before Kaiser
[02:12:52.000 --> 02:12:54.000]  precipitated on cookies again,
[02:12:54.000 --> 02:13:00.000]  that, you know, my take on these Russian sex operatives,
[02:13:00.000 --> 02:13:03.000]  sleeper sex operatives is what I would call them.
[02:13:03.000 --> 02:13:05.000]  And the fact is trying to relaunch a new cold war
[02:13:05.000 --> 02:13:06.000]  on the back of this.
[02:13:06.000 --> 02:13:08.000]  But more interestingly that you see the Russians
[02:13:08.000 --> 02:13:10.000]  trying to infiltrate the gold and silver market
[02:13:10.000 --> 02:13:13.000]  to try to find out what's happening in New York
[02:13:13.000 --> 02:13:16.000]  because they're big buyers, because they know it's rigged,
[02:13:16.000 --> 02:13:24.000]  and also infiltrating Harvard and Facebook-style systems.
[02:13:24.000 --> 02:13:28.000]  I mean, that's really where the real black ops are going on.
[02:13:28.000 --> 02:13:31.000]  Or do you disagree, Bob Chapman?
[02:13:31.000 --> 02:13:34.000]  Well, it's certainly on the ground
[02:13:34.000 --> 02:13:38.000]  a type of counterintelligence.
[02:13:38.000 --> 02:13:44.000]  And you are very, very right in saying that is real spying.
[02:13:44.000 --> 02:13:45.000]  And you're right.
[02:13:45.000 --> 02:13:48.000]  Everything else is usually done by satellite today.
[02:13:48.000 --> 02:13:54.000]  And one of the complaints about the good guys inside the CIA
[02:13:54.000 --> 02:13:57.000]  is we didn't do any of that anymore.
[02:13:57.000 --> 02:13:59.000]  Or we're not doing much of that anymore.
[02:13:59.000 --> 02:14:01.000]  And that's where the action is.
[02:14:01.000 --> 02:14:03.000]  And so the Russians have done it.
[02:14:03.000 --> 02:14:06.000]  And they've done it over and over again.
[02:14:06.000 --> 02:14:08.000]  And they're really good at it.
[02:14:08.000 --> 02:14:13.000]  I mean, people in America discount the abilities of people
[02:14:13.000 --> 02:14:15.000]  in other countries.
[02:14:15.000 --> 02:14:17.000]  The Russians are very bright people.
[02:14:17.000 --> 02:14:19.000]  I know I worked against them.
[02:14:19.000 --> 02:14:23.000]  And so it's not surprising they have such units
[02:14:23.000 --> 02:14:24.000]  within the United States.
[02:14:24.000 --> 02:14:26.000]  And they probably are guilty.
[02:14:26.000 --> 02:14:28.000]  But I think in your conversation with Max,
[02:14:28.000 --> 02:14:30.000]  the timing is very important.
[02:14:30.000 --> 02:14:35.000]  This has been a well-planned takedown and furtherance operation,
[02:14:35.000 --> 02:14:39.000]  perhaps because of the wearing out of the terrorism label.
[02:14:39.000 --> 02:14:42.000]  And maybe we've got to find some no-bogie man
[02:14:42.000 --> 02:14:45.000]  who in this case would be the Russians again.
[02:14:45.000 --> 02:14:48.000]  And yes, the Russians have been buying gold for a long time.
[02:14:48.000 --> 02:14:51.000]  And they're expediting their purchases.
[02:14:51.000 --> 02:14:54.000]  And we've covered all this in the international forecaster.
[02:14:54.000 --> 02:14:59.000]  But I think, and I'm only guessing,
[02:14:59.000 --> 02:15:04.000]  that the Russians are monitoring, monitoring, monitoring.
[02:15:04.000 --> 02:15:09.000]  Yes, I get it out, monitoring several publications.
[02:15:09.000 --> 02:15:10.000]  Mayan's one of them.
[02:15:10.000 --> 02:15:14.000]  And Gader is another one.
[02:15:14.000 --> 02:15:18.000]  And they attended a very high Russian official
[02:15:18.000 --> 02:15:22.000]  from the Finance Division of the Russian government
[02:15:22.000 --> 02:15:25.000]  back about eight years ago,
[02:15:25.000 --> 02:15:28.000]  attended one of Gada's meetings in Alaska.
[02:15:28.000 --> 02:15:31.000]  If I'm not mistaken, that's the location.
[02:15:31.000 --> 02:15:33.000]  And they get filled in.
[02:15:33.000 --> 02:15:38.000]  And they saw the direction that things would eventually have to go
[02:15:38.000 --> 02:15:40.000]  and knew they had to accumulate.
[02:15:40.000 --> 02:15:43.000]  And they knew from attending that meeting
[02:15:43.000 --> 02:15:46.000]  and reading their stuff as well as Mayan
[02:15:46.000 --> 02:15:50.000]  that the markets are being rigged.
[02:15:50.000 --> 02:15:54.000]  And they wanted to be able to take advantage of it.
[02:15:54.000 --> 02:15:57.000]  In other words, like, we'll take this recently.
[02:15:57.000 --> 02:16:01.000]  Gold was taken down $35 or $40 in one day.
[02:16:01.000 --> 02:16:05.000]  And if they can know something like that ahead of time,
[02:16:05.000 --> 02:16:07.000]  they can go short.
[02:16:07.000 --> 02:16:12.000]  And then, like today, cover their short and go long as well.
[02:16:12.000 --> 02:16:16.000]  And so they are heavily playing the gold market.
[02:16:16.000 --> 02:16:19.000]  And they have, even when it was the Soviet Union...
[02:16:19.000 --> 02:16:22.000]  Dr. Titania Karajna, what was it about eight years ago,
[02:16:22.000 --> 02:16:25.000]  one of their chief finance ministers,
[02:16:25.000 --> 02:16:27.000]  one of their chief think tank people,
[02:16:27.000 --> 02:16:30.000]  came out and said there's a $300 trillion group.
[02:16:30.000 --> 02:16:32.000]  They're the Illuminati.
[02:16:32.000 --> 02:16:34.000]  They call themselves the Deadhead Group,
[02:16:34.000 --> 02:16:36.000]  which translates into the English to Scummon Bones,
[02:16:36.000 --> 02:16:38.000]  the Scummon Crossbones, the Deadhead.
[02:16:38.000 --> 02:16:42.000]  And that they are planning to sell derivatives
[02:16:42.000 --> 02:16:44.000]  and destroy the world economy.
[02:16:44.000 --> 02:16:48.000]  I mean, that was in Newsmax, WorldNet Daily, Infowars.com,
[02:16:48.000 --> 02:16:51.000]  Rick Wiles covered it eight, nine years ago.
[02:16:51.000 --> 02:16:54.000]  And I mean, I just forget how right we've all been
[02:16:54.000 --> 02:16:58.000]  about what these people were planning and shifting gears.
[02:16:58.000 --> 02:17:00.000]  What does this signify, Bob,
[02:17:00.000 --> 02:17:02.000]  because it's old news for our listeners and our audience
[02:17:02.000 --> 02:17:06.000]  and people that read your international forecaster newsletter,
[02:17:06.000 --> 02:17:09.000]  but what does it signify to now have the U.N.,
[02:17:09.000 --> 02:17:12.000]  CNN, ABC News, AP Reuters all announced
[02:17:12.000 --> 02:17:15.000]  Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday and Friday today.
[02:17:15.000 --> 02:17:18.000]  It's made national news. Our story is one of the top stories
[02:17:18.000 --> 02:17:22.000]  on drugs, dollar plunges after U.N. call to ditch greenback.
[02:17:22.000 --> 02:17:25.000]  All of this is happening.
[02:17:25.000 --> 02:17:28.000]  And so what does it signify that they're coming out and saying,
[02:17:28.000 --> 02:17:31.000]  okay, all the currencies are going to stay,
[02:17:31.000 --> 02:17:33.000]  but they're going to be devalued,
[02:17:33.000 --> 02:17:35.000]  and a private group of banks is going to run it,
[02:17:35.000 --> 02:17:36.000]  and it's going to be World Government,
[02:17:36.000 --> 02:17:38.000]  as Herman von Rumpi said last November.
[02:17:38.000 --> 02:17:40.000]  They headed the EU.
[02:17:40.000 --> 02:17:44.000]  And you will now pay your carbon taxes to us,
[02:17:44.000 --> 02:17:47.000]  and we will have a new SDR over the whole globe.
[02:17:47.000 --> 02:17:49.000]  I mean, this is a private group of bankers
[02:17:49.000 --> 02:17:51.000]  that have created the fraud,
[02:17:51.000 --> 02:17:54.000]  openly announcing the takeover of our currency.
[02:17:54.000 --> 02:17:58.000]  This is the highest form of economic takeover,
[02:17:58.000 --> 02:18:00.000]  and everyone involved in the government
[02:18:00.000 --> 02:18:03.000]  is guilty of high treason.
[02:18:03.000 --> 02:18:05.000]  And that's absolutely so.
[02:18:05.000 --> 02:18:07.000]  It doesn't mean they're going to be successful
[02:18:07.000 --> 02:18:09.000]  in doing what they're doing.
[02:18:09.000 --> 02:18:11.000]  They're having to expedite their program
[02:18:11.000 --> 02:18:14.000]  for the very reasons that you and I have discussed
[02:18:14.000 --> 02:18:15.000]  over and over again,
[02:18:15.000 --> 02:18:19.000]  and that is we're letting people know exactly
[02:18:19.000 --> 02:18:21.000]  what they're doing, how they're doing it,
[02:18:21.000 --> 02:18:26.000]  and what they expect as a final product.
[02:18:26.000 --> 02:18:29.000]  I think that you have to look at
[02:18:29.000 --> 02:18:32.000]  the directions that they've gone in recently.
[02:18:32.000 --> 02:18:35.000]  I think grease blew up in their face,
[02:18:35.000 --> 02:18:39.000]  and they still may very well lose
[02:18:39.000 --> 02:18:41.000]  by being the alumnus.
[02:18:41.000 --> 02:18:43.000]  The service is a pump and drill
[02:18:43.000 --> 02:18:45.000]  because I keep on drilling them over there
[02:18:45.000 --> 02:18:47.000]  to get rid of them,
[02:18:47.000 --> 02:18:50.000]  and maybe that will have an effect.
[02:18:50.000 --> 02:18:52.000]  But that's what they need to do,
[02:18:52.000 --> 02:18:55.000]  and they need to default,
[02:18:55.000 --> 02:18:57.000]  get out of the euro, go to the drachma,
[02:18:57.000 --> 02:19:02.000]  and also cut expenses in government by...
[02:19:02.000 --> 02:19:03.000]  For those that don't know,
[02:19:03.000 --> 02:19:05.000]  explain to them that Goldman Sachs
[02:19:05.000 --> 02:19:08.000]  has its officials that 10 years ago
[02:19:08.000 --> 02:19:11.000]  set grease up now actually running the takeover
[02:19:11.000 --> 02:19:15.000]  in the handover of 600 islands.
[02:19:15.000 --> 02:19:16.000]  That's correct,
[02:19:16.000 --> 02:19:20.000]  and of course the puppet master in this game
[02:19:20.000 --> 02:19:22.000]  is not only Goldman Sachs,
[02:19:22.000 --> 02:19:25.000]  but the Bilderberger pump and drill.
[02:19:25.000 --> 02:19:27.000]  And I told them, I said,
[02:19:27.000 --> 02:19:29.000]  they just did another documentary,
[02:19:29.000 --> 02:19:31.000]  I don't think it's been released yet,
[02:19:31.000 --> 02:19:32.000]  but I told them, I said,
[02:19:32.000 --> 02:19:34.000]  if you can impeach him,
[02:19:34.000 --> 02:19:36.000]  however you do it, get rid of him.
[02:19:36.000 --> 02:19:38.000]  And you don't want to let any of your islands
[02:19:38.000 --> 02:19:40.000]  go for 20 or 30 cents in the dollar
[02:19:40.000 --> 02:19:43.000]  to a group of aluminists.
[02:19:43.000 --> 02:19:44.000]  Well, I mean, literally,
[02:19:44.000 --> 02:19:47.000]  they swindle them selling them these derivatives,
[02:19:47.000 --> 02:19:50.000]  and then the country is selling the islands
[02:19:50.000 --> 02:19:52.000]  to the heads of the brokerage firms
[02:19:52.000 --> 02:19:54.000]  by name that set them up.
[02:19:54.000 --> 02:19:55.000]  I mean, this is...
[02:19:55.000 --> 02:19:58.000]  They should be calling for these people's arrest,
[02:19:58.000 --> 02:20:01.000]  not giving them their islands and their highways.
[02:20:01.000 --> 02:20:02.000]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[02:20:02.000 --> 02:20:04.000]  Did you know that the global elite
[02:20:04.000 --> 02:20:06.000]  are now storing non-hybrid seeds
[02:20:06.000 --> 02:20:08.000]  in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[02:20:08.000 --> 02:20:10.000]  Did you know that in a real meltdown,
[02:20:10.000 --> 02:20:12.000]  non-hybrid seeds could become more valuable
[02:20:12.000 --> 02:20:13.000]  than silver or gold?
[02:20:13.000 --> 02:20:15.000]  It's true, seeds have outperformed even gold
[02:20:15.000 --> 02:20:17.000]  and silver before in this country,
[02:20:17.000 --> 02:20:19.000]  and it's possible that could even happen again.
[02:20:19.000 --> 02:20:21.000]  So our friends at Solutions from Science
[02:20:21.000 --> 02:20:24.000]  have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds.
[02:20:24.000 --> 02:20:26.000]  They call it a survival seed bank,
[02:20:26.000 --> 02:20:28.000]  and it can produce an endless supply
[02:20:28.000 --> 02:20:31.000]  of nutrient-dense food for you and your family.
[02:20:31.000 --> 02:20:32.000]  And here's the best part.
[02:20:32.000 --> 02:20:35.000]  These seeds have not been genetically modified in any way,
[02:20:35.000 --> 02:20:37.000]  and you actually get enough seeds
[02:20:37.000 --> 02:20:39.000]  to plant a full-acre crisis garden.
[02:20:39.000 --> 02:20:42.000]  So visit them today at survivalseedbank.com.
[02:20:42.000 --> 02:20:44.000]  That's survivalseedbank.com,
[02:20:44.000 --> 02:20:49.000]  or give them a call at 877-327-0365.
[02:20:49.000 --> 02:20:53.000]  That's 877-327-0365.
[02:20:53.000 --> 02:20:55.000]  Remember, in a real crisis,
[02:20:55.000 --> 02:20:58.000]  non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item.
[02:20:58.000 --> 02:21:02.000]  This is Alex Jones for survivalseedbank.com.

[02:22:26.000 --> 02:22:29.000]  This is not only a transfer of power to an institution
[02:22:29.000 --> 02:22:31.000]  that is not accountable to our elected government,
[02:22:31.000 --> 02:22:34.000]  but is also caused the dollar to lose more than 90 cents
[02:22:34.000 --> 02:22:36.000]  of its original value.
[02:22:36.000 --> 02:22:38.000]  Now foreign governments are trying to divest themselves
[02:22:38.000 --> 02:22:40.000]  from this once-world reserve currency.
[02:22:40.000 --> 02:22:42.000]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.

[02:24:04.000 --> 02:24:07.000]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:24:14.000 --> 02:24:15.000]  Coming up in the next segment,
[02:24:15.000 --> 02:24:17.000]  we're going to be taking some of your phone calls
[02:24:17.000 --> 02:24:20.000]  and I'm going to play this clip and get Bob Chapman's take on it
[02:24:20.000 --> 02:24:23.000]  of Congressman Pete Stark.
[02:24:23.000 --> 02:24:25.000]  You've seen little clips on the news the last few days,
[02:24:25.000 --> 02:24:28.000]  but we have the whole 10-minute exchange
[02:24:28.000 --> 02:24:32.000]  posted up at infowars.com and prisonplanet.com
[02:24:32.000 --> 02:24:34.000]  where he just says there's no problem with the border
[02:24:34.000 --> 02:24:37.000]  and anybody that wants to control the border wants to kill people.
[02:24:37.000 --> 02:24:40.000]  I mean, their propaganda is just arrogantly delivered.
[02:24:40.000 --> 02:24:43.000]  It's asinine and we see this throughout history
[02:24:43.000 --> 02:24:45.000]  where elites get into trouble.
[02:24:45.000 --> 02:24:48.000]  A lot of times they just become even more arrogant
[02:24:48.000 --> 02:24:51.000]  and that only hastens their implosion.
[02:24:51.000 --> 02:24:54.000]  But Bob, I'm starting to think more and more.
[02:24:54.000 --> 02:24:56.000]  Gerald Salente may be right again.
[02:24:56.000 --> 02:24:59.000]  Putting a date on it, we've seen
[02:24:59.000 --> 02:25:02.000]  top New York Times, Wall Street Journal,
[02:25:02.000 --> 02:25:05.000]  and other writers saying we are in the Greatest Depression
[02:25:05.000 --> 02:25:08.000]  or the Third Depression.
[02:25:08.000 --> 02:25:11.000]  Obama's now calling it the Greatest Recession.
[02:25:11.000 --> 02:25:14.000]  By every yardstick, as you said two years ago,
[02:25:14.000 --> 02:25:16.000]  we are in a depression.
[02:25:16.000 --> 02:25:18.000]  Do you think they may announce it?
[02:25:18.000 --> 02:25:22.000]  Because they're now saying they're not going to have a second stimulus,
[02:25:22.000 --> 02:25:27.000]  which you've said would put this off another year.
[02:25:27.000 --> 02:25:32.000]  Well, first of all, I think if they are going to say we're in a depression,
[02:25:32.000 --> 02:25:34.000]  they're going to wait until they start their war
[02:25:34.000 --> 02:25:37.000]  and then blame the depression on the war.
[02:25:37.000 --> 02:25:40.000]  That's logical and that's what they've done before.
[02:25:40.000 --> 02:25:43.000]  And so that might be an up and coming event
[02:25:43.000 --> 02:25:47.000]  that may start out in a limited way with Iran
[02:25:47.000 --> 02:25:49.000]  and may spread.
[02:25:49.000 --> 02:25:52.000]  Russia may be brought into it.
[02:25:52.000 --> 02:25:56.000]  And the recent apprehension of these spies
[02:25:56.000 --> 02:26:00.000]  might be a lead into that as you indicated it could be
[02:26:00.000 --> 02:26:02.000]  a lead into something.
[02:26:02.000 --> 02:26:07.000]  And so, you know, the groundwork is there
[02:26:07.000 --> 02:26:10.000]  and they could very well go ahead with it,
[02:26:10.000 --> 02:26:14.000]  but I don't think they're going to use the word depression.
[02:26:14.000 --> 02:26:18.000]  Maybe Paul Krugman, Ken in the New York Times.
[02:26:18.000 --> 02:26:23.000]  But I don't think you're going to see it officially coming out
[02:26:23.000 --> 02:26:28.000]  from any important alumnus or the President of the United States
[02:26:28.000 --> 02:26:30.000]  until it's time.
[02:26:30.000 --> 02:26:35.000]  And as far as stimulus in the economy,
[02:26:35.000 --> 02:26:40.000]  I don't think under present circumstances they can get the stimulus they want,
[02:26:40.000 --> 02:26:42.000]  although maybe it's still possible.
[02:26:42.000 --> 02:26:47.000]  But, you know, the Federal Reserve is perfectly capable
[02:26:47.000 --> 02:26:51.000]  of putting $5 trillion into the economy
[02:26:51.000 --> 02:26:56.000]  between now and the election two and a half years from now.
[02:26:56.000 --> 02:27:01.000]  And that could keep the markets up to an extent.
[02:27:01.000 --> 02:27:04.000]  Although I do think they're going down,
[02:27:04.000 --> 02:27:08.000]  maybe they wouldn't during that time period go as low as they might go.
[02:27:08.000 --> 02:27:14.000]  But they have the ability to keep the economy going sideways to slightly higher.
[02:27:14.000 --> 02:27:19.000]  I think they could get employment going in the other direction.
[02:27:19.000 --> 02:27:25.000]  And they could do that by allowing or forcing banks to lend
[02:27:25.000 --> 02:27:29.000]  to small and medium-sized businesses, which they're not doing.
[02:27:29.000 --> 02:27:32.000]  And that money is being held in a bay and so they have lots of it.
[02:27:32.000 --> 02:27:35.000]  Well, Bob, we're only four months away from the election.
[02:27:35.000 --> 02:27:39.000]  I mean, if they're going to fully implode the economy and start a war,
[02:27:39.000 --> 02:27:41.000]  wouldn't they start the war before the election
[02:27:41.000 --> 02:27:45.000]  and then implode the economy fully after the election?
[02:27:45.000 --> 02:27:49.000]  Good timing. That's what I expect them to do.
[02:27:49.000 --> 02:27:53.000]  And the talk about the devaluation of the dollar is true.
[02:27:53.000 --> 02:27:57.000]  Max is right. Max got wonderful stuff he's putting out.
[02:27:57.000 --> 02:27:59.000]  And so is Gerald.
[02:27:59.000 --> 02:28:04.000]  And, you know, in yourself, we just keep on hammering.
[02:28:04.000 --> 02:28:07.000]  I just love it because we're going to get them.
[02:28:07.000 --> 02:28:10.000]  They're not going to be successful.
[02:28:10.000 --> 02:28:14.000]  Here's just a little side note.
[02:28:14.000 --> 02:28:20.000]  70 million expired flu vaccines admitted to be incinerated as waste.
[02:28:20.000 --> 02:28:25.000]  That's being reported by the Associated Press, also natural news.
[02:28:25.000 --> 02:28:28.000]  But now they admit that no one needed to take the H1N1 shot,
[02:28:28.000 --> 02:28:30.000]  that it was also dangerous.
[02:28:30.000 --> 02:28:35.000]  But separately, they're trying to make people take last year's shot,
[02:28:35.000 --> 02:28:37.000]  recommending it.
[02:28:37.000 --> 02:28:40.000]  I mean, they are just totally discrediting themselves.
[02:28:40.000 --> 02:28:43.000]  Or is the government and these criminal corporations,
[02:28:43.000 --> 02:28:49.000]  are they marketing to that 30% that they know is as dumb as a box of rocks?
[02:28:49.000 --> 02:28:51.000]  And they always will.
[02:28:51.000 --> 02:28:57.000]  That's why Hollywood points their pitches to its 12- and 13-year-old mentalities.
[02:28:57.000 --> 02:29:01.000]  And things haven't changed that much over the intervening years,
[02:29:01.000 --> 02:29:05.000]  we'll say since the beginning of the 20th century.
[02:29:05.000 --> 02:29:10.000]  People are still fundamentally intellectually the same.
[02:29:10.000 --> 02:29:17.000]  And all of the teaching in the world can't raise an IQ very much.
[02:29:17.000 --> 02:29:20.000]  And so, yes, they're appealing to that.
[02:29:20.000 --> 02:29:24.000]  They're appealing to anything that they can appeal to.
[02:29:24.000 --> 02:29:26.000]  Desperate people do desperate things.
[02:29:26.000 --> 02:29:29.000]  And as Brzezinski said, we're in trouble.
[02:29:29.000 --> 02:29:33.000]  These people know what we're doing.
[02:29:33.000 --> 02:29:34.000]  You're absolutely right.
[02:29:34.000 --> 02:29:36.000]  Bob Chapman, our guest for the rest of the hour.
[02:29:36.000 --> 02:29:42.000]  Then we have a filmmaker joining us who's got solutions to this banking crime syndicate.
[02:29:42.000 --> 02:29:43.000]  Oh, it's not enough to just get rid of them.
[02:29:43.000 --> 02:29:44.000]  We've got to have solutions.
[02:29:44.000 --> 02:29:46.000]  That's coming up as well.
[02:29:46.000 --> 02:29:50.000]  Stay with us.
[02:29:50.000 --> 02:29:52.000]  We're on the march.
[02:29:52.000 --> 02:29:54.000]  The Empire's on the run.
[02:29:54.000 --> 02:30:00.000]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:00.000 --> 02:30:04.000]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[02:30:04.000 --> 02:30:09.000]  Number one, new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[02:30:09.000 --> 02:30:14.000]  Number two, our new energies are wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[02:30:14.000 --> 02:30:20.000]  It's true, total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[02:30:20.000 --> 02:30:25.000]  Number three, in some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[02:30:25.000 --> 02:30:29.000]  And now new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[02:30:29.000 --> 02:30:32.000]  Number four, dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[02:30:32.000 --> 02:30:36.000]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather related onages.
[02:30:36.000 --> 02:30:41.000]  Number five, a solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind.
[02:30:41.000 --> 02:30:46.000]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[02:30:46.000 --> 02:30:50.000]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[02:30:50.000 --> 02:30:52.000]  That's mysolarbackup.com.

[02:31:00.000 --> 02:31:04.000]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[02:31:04.000 --> 02:31:09.000]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[02:31:09.000 --> 02:31:14.000]  My answer would be all I can get in the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones.
[02:31:14.000 --> 02:31:16.000]  Food is your only ammunition.
[02:31:16.000 --> 02:31:18.000]  How much do you want? When do you want it?
[02:31:18.000 --> 02:31:20.000]  Now or after the battle starts.
[02:31:20.000 --> 02:31:23.000]  When will you need it? Can you buy it without proper identification?
[02:31:23.000 --> 02:31:26.000]  Will there be any food? Will it make your children sick?
[02:31:26.000 --> 02:31:31.000]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[02:31:31.000 --> 02:31:35.000]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[02:31:35.000 --> 02:31:39.000]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[02:31:39.000 --> 02:31:41.000]  How much will you need? We don't know.
[02:31:41.000 --> 02:31:44.000]  How much do you want? All you can get. I'm Alex Jones.
[02:31:44.000 --> 02:31:47.000]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.
[02:31:47.000 --> 02:31:55.000]  Call 1-800-409-5633 or check it out on the web at eFoodsDirect.com.
[02:31:55.000 --> 02:31:59.000]  Again, that number 1-800-409-5633.
[02:32:01.000 --> 02:32:07.000]  The fall of America and the western world is an all new 10 hour documentary and survival guide rolled into one.
[02:32:07.000 --> 02:32:12.000]  In this film, you will see the reasons why our government is failing and what you can do to prepare.
[02:32:12.000 --> 02:32:21.000]  Featuring Dr. Paul Craig Roberts, Joseph Farah, David Ike, Naomi Wolf, G. Edward Griffin, Doug McIntyre, Mark Crispin Miller,
[02:32:21.000 --> 02:32:26.000]  Mickey Z, Doug Casey, David McElvaney, and myself, Alex Jones.
[02:32:26.000 --> 02:32:31.000]  Protect yourself and get the tools you need to protect your family from these difficult times.
[02:32:31.000 --> 02:32:38.000]  The fall of America and the western world at www.thefallofamerica.net
[02:32:38.000 --> 02:32:42.000]  or click on the banners at infowars.com and prisonplanet.com.
[02:32:42.000 --> 02:32:51.000]  Again, that website is www.thefallofamerica.net or call 800-655-1577.
[02:32:51.000 --> 02:33:01.000]  Prepare yourself and the ones you love today, fallofamerica.net.
[02:33:21.000 --> 02:33:30.000]  Back in November, saying the G-20 and the Copenhagen Summit is going to be the birth of global governance.
[02:33:30.000 --> 02:33:35.000]  And notice, it's for the carbon tax, it's for the oil spill, it's for the banking collapse.
[02:33:35.000 --> 02:33:41.000]  The banks want to directly tax you and not have to deal with governments anymore.
[02:33:41.000 --> 02:33:46.000]  They want to be above it and create a new level of Ponzi scheme.
[02:33:46.000 --> 02:33:51.000]  Actual world government run by private interest. So let's go ahead and play that clip
[02:33:51.000 --> 02:33:58.000]  and then I want to move on to another trader, another arrogant sack of horse manure.
[02:33:58.000 --> 02:34:02.000]  I'm sorry to use that term as long as we're describing Congressman Pete Stark.
[02:34:02.000 --> 02:34:05.000]  But let's play Herman von Roompi. Here it is.
[02:34:05.000 --> 02:34:11.000]  These problems can be overcome by a joint effort in and between our countries.
[02:34:11.000 --> 02:34:19.000]  2009 is also the first year of global governance with the establishment of the G-20 in the middle of the financial crisis.
[02:34:19.000 --> 02:34:27.000]  The climate conference in Copenhagen is another step towards the global management of our planet.
[02:34:27.000 --> 02:34:32.000]  Our mission, our presidency, is one of hope.
[02:34:32.000 --> 02:34:33.000]  All right.
[02:34:33.000 --> 02:34:34.000]  Supported by acts.
[02:34:34.000 --> 02:34:39.000]  And you got not just von Roompi but Ban Ki-moon of the UN and all of them saying the same thing.
[02:34:39.000 --> 02:34:45.000]  I just wanted to get that on record now that they've gone from just talking about it in their global conferences
[02:34:45.000 --> 02:34:50.000]  to openly telling you the answer to all your financial problems that we caused by design
[02:34:50.000 --> 02:34:53.000]  is giving us more power and paying us more money.
[02:34:53.000 --> 02:34:56.000]  The answer to that oil spill is paying us more money.
[02:34:56.000 --> 02:34:58.000]  And we'll talk to Bob about the oil spill.
[02:34:58.000 --> 02:35:02.000]  But first, I want to play this clip because you've seen little clips on the news.
[02:35:02.000 --> 02:35:10.000]  This was so arrogant that they happened to have Chris Matthews on for entertainment value in the coffee room Wednesday night.
[02:35:10.000 --> 02:35:16.000]  And I walked in there Wednesday afternoon and he played the Pete Stark clip where Stark was being arrogant saying,
[02:35:16.000 --> 02:35:18.000]  you want to shoot people, don't you?
[02:35:18.000 --> 02:35:19.000]  You don't want to open borders.
[02:35:19.000 --> 02:35:22.000]  You want to kill people just to a town hall in California.
[02:35:22.000 --> 02:35:26.000]  People are like, no, we're not even Minutemen, but they're not killing people.
[02:35:26.000 --> 02:35:28.000]  And like, there's no border problem.
[02:35:28.000 --> 02:35:38.000]  I mean, even Chris Matthews, a Democrat hack, had to say, my gosh, is that not the face of incumbency?
[02:35:38.000 --> 02:35:40.000]  I mean, this arrogant creature.
[02:35:40.000 --> 02:35:45.000]  Now, the whole video, it's like 10 minutes long, is up on Info Wars and Prison Planet, unedited.
[02:35:45.000 --> 02:35:51.000]  But we don't, for time constraints, I'm just going to play the first minute or two and then get Bob Chapman's take on this
[02:35:51.000 --> 02:35:53.000]  because this is arrogance.
[02:35:53.000 --> 02:35:59.000]  I mean, Mexico is admittedly collapsed. The State Department foreign governments say it's a failed state.
[02:35:59.000 --> 02:36:02.000]  Now it's 23,000 deaths in the last two years.
[02:36:02.000 --> 02:36:06.000]  80 plus miles of Arizona is off limits to citizens.
[02:36:06.000 --> 02:36:11.000]  I mean, it is just just total bedlam, total bedlam.
[02:36:11.000 --> 02:36:15.000]  I mean, South Texas is just shutting down in the border areas.
[02:36:15.000 --> 02:36:24.000]  I saw a news clip, in fact, I ought to pull that up, of Detroit, where they deliver food to the food lions and stuff.
[02:36:24.000 --> 02:36:28.000]  And they have guys with machine guns guarding the food now, going into grocery stores.
[02:36:28.000 --> 02:36:32.000]  I mean, Mad Max stuff in 10 cities are creeping in everywhere.
[02:36:32.000 --> 02:36:34.000]  And it's only going to get worse.
[02:36:34.000 --> 02:36:36.000]  This is what NAFTA and GATT did.
[02:36:36.000 --> 02:36:39.000]  And this guy thinks it's all funny.
[02:36:39.000 --> 02:36:43.000]  I mean, whether you're four open borders or not, don't say the border isn't open.
[02:36:43.000 --> 02:36:46.000]  Don't say there isn't a problem. Don't say it isn't horrible.
[02:36:46.000 --> 02:36:51.000]  Don't say there aren't these poor Mexicans sneaking across, getting killed by the hundreds every month,
[02:36:51.000 --> 02:36:55.000]  and robbed by coyotes on the Mexican and U.S. side.
[02:36:55.000 --> 02:36:58.000]  I mean, this is dangerous, folks. This is lawlessness.
[02:36:58.000 --> 02:37:02.000]  This is like Afghanistan or something. Here it is.
[02:37:02.000 --> 02:37:09.000]  The minute men want to have something to say, who are you going to kill today?
[02:37:09.000 --> 02:37:11.000]  Who are we going to kill today?
[02:37:11.000 --> 02:37:15.000]  Well, I'd just like to know, well, actually, American citizens are being killed right now,
[02:37:15.000 --> 02:37:16.000]  but that's what's going on.
[02:37:16.000 --> 02:37:17.000]  That's right.
[02:37:17.000 --> 02:37:24.000]  Okay, I want to know why the federal government is not doing anything or a lot more to seal our borders in this country
[02:37:24.000 --> 02:37:26.000]  so we're a solvent country again.
[02:37:26.000 --> 02:37:28.000]  Well, we can't get enough minute men armed.
[02:37:28.000 --> 02:37:33.000]  We'd like to get all the minute men armed so that they can stop shooting people here.
[02:37:33.000 --> 02:37:35.000]  It's not your job. We're just citizens of the United States.
[02:37:35.000 --> 02:37:43.000]  So he calls anybody in the crowd because it goes on who's for sovereignty and defending our borders.
[02:37:43.000 --> 02:37:47.000]  Minute men who want to kill more people and have killed people.
[02:37:47.000 --> 02:37:49.000]  The minute men have killed no one.
[02:37:49.000 --> 02:37:54.000]  Okay, so this is what Saul Alinsky taught communists to do.
[02:37:54.000 --> 02:37:56.000]  Accused people of what you do.
[02:37:56.000 --> 02:37:59.000]  The illegal aliens and the drug traffickers are the ones killing people.
[02:37:59.000 --> 02:38:03.000]  So he's saying, oh, no, the minute men are killing people. Let's continue.
[02:38:03.000 --> 02:38:06.000]  This country said we're a solvent country again.
[02:38:06.000 --> 02:38:08.000]  Well, we can't get enough minute men armed.
[02:38:08.000 --> 02:38:13.000]  We'd like to get all the minute men armed so that they can stop shooting people here.
[02:38:13.000 --> 02:38:15.000]  It's not your job. We're just citizens of the United States.
[02:38:15.000 --> 02:38:17.000]  We're a funny kind of...
[02:38:17.000 --> 02:38:25.000]  We'll try and get you some more arms and get you down there to shoot people.
[02:38:25.000 --> 02:38:28.000]  We don't want to go down there. We want to have normal lives.
[02:38:28.000 --> 02:38:32.000]  We pay taxes and we pay to have the government take care of our borders.
[02:38:32.000 --> 02:38:34.000]  Is that all?
[02:38:34.000 --> 02:38:36.000]  Is that all what the government should do?
[02:38:36.000 --> 02:38:38.000]  Well, that's one of the things the government is supposed to do.
[02:38:38.000 --> 02:38:40.000]  That's what the federal government is there for.
[02:38:40.000 --> 02:38:42.000]  They say they're going to do it and they're not doing it.
[02:38:42.000 --> 02:38:44.000]  Well, then we don't need the minute men.
[02:38:44.000 --> 02:38:46.000]  That's correct. We don't want them to do it.
[02:38:46.000 --> 02:38:48.000]  Send the minute men home. That's a good idea.
[02:38:48.000 --> 02:38:50.000]  No, why are you asking a question?
[02:38:50.000 --> 02:38:52.000]  Answer the question.
[02:38:52.000 --> 02:38:54.000]  What answer?
[02:38:54.000 --> 02:38:56.000]  Wait, you don't want to...
[02:38:56.000 --> 02:38:59.000]  What kind of an answer would you like, young man?
[02:38:59.000 --> 02:39:01.000]  He asked the question.
[02:39:01.000 --> 02:39:04.000]  Can I answer? Do you mind if I answer?
[02:39:04.000 --> 02:39:06.000]  Excuse me.
[02:39:06.000 --> 02:39:08.000]  Please do answer the question.
[02:39:08.000 --> 02:39:09.000]  What's your question?
[02:39:09.000 --> 02:39:13.000]  The question is, why is the federal government leaving our borders for us
[02:39:13.000 --> 02:39:15.000]  for anybody to come in anywhere they want?
[02:39:15.000 --> 02:39:17.000]  If you knew anything about our borders...
[02:39:21.000 --> 02:39:23.000]  You would know that that's not the case.
[02:39:23.000 --> 02:39:26.000]  Our borders are quite secure, thank you.
[02:39:26.000 --> 02:39:28.000]  Excuse me.
[02:39:28.000 --> 02:39:30.000]  Back that up.
[02:39:30.000 --> 02:39:32.000]  Back that up. This is unedited.
[02:39:32.000 --> 02:39:34.000]  Our borders are quite secure, thank you.
[02:39:34.000 --> 02:39:36.000]  And notice he talks like...
[02:39:38.000 --> 02:39:40.000]  One of these burnout
[02:39:40.000 --> 02:39:42.000]  high school teachers
[02:39:42.000 --> 02:39:44.000]  who sneaks off at lunch
[02:39:44.000 --> 02:39:46.000]  and has a martini lunch
[02:39:46.000 --> 02:39:48.000]  and he sits there
[02:39:48.000 --> 02:39:51.000]  like he's talking to a group of elementary school students
[02:39:51.000 --> 02:39:53.000]  where it isn't about the information.
[02:39:53.000 --> 02:39:55.000]  It's about him acting smug and saying
[02:39:55.000 --> 02:39:57.000]  then the minute men can go home, can they?
[02:39:57.000 --> 02:39:59.000]  It's all about how we're trash.
[02:39:59.000 --> 02:40:01.000]  And this is the quintessential
[02:40:01.000 --> 02:40:03.000]  fake liberal arrogance.
[02:40:03.000 --> 02:40:05.000]  I mean, you'll sit there and tell them a decade ago
[02:40:05.000 --> 02:40:07.000]  derivatives are going to destroy us.
[02:40:07.000 --> 02:40:09.000]  It will destroy our economy.
[02:40:09.000 --> 02:40:11.000]  And they're like, the economy's doing great.
[02:40:11.000 --> 02:40:13.000]  Well, shut up conspiracy theorist.
[02:40:13.000 --> 02:40:15.000]  Bob Chapman hearing that
[02:40:15.000 --> 02:40:17.000]  and for TV viewers that are watching on prisonplanet.tv
[02:40:17.000 --> 02:40:19.000]  watching that,
[02:40:19.000 --> 02:40:21.000]  that attitude, that spirit,
[02:40:21.000 --> 02:40:23.000]  I think really illustrates
[02:40:23.000 --> 02:40:25.000]  really illustrates everything
[02:40:25.000 --> 02:40:27.000]  that we're fighting
[02:40:27.000 --> 02:40:29.000]  and is 180 degrees
[02:40:29.000 --> 02:40:31.000]  the opposite of what our founders
[02:40:31.000 --> 02:40:33.000]  set up as we go into the fourth that you lie.
[02:40:33.000 --> 02:40:35.000]  I mean, is that guy...
[02:40:35.000 --> 02:40:37.000]  I don't just throw the word treason around.
[02:40:37.000 --> 02:40:39.000]  Is that guy not a treacherous
[02:40:39.000 --> 02:40:41.000]  little vermin?
[02:40:41.000 --> 02:40:43.000]  This creature, Congressman Pete Stark,
[02:40:43.000 --> 02:40:45.000]  I mean, he needs to be thrown out
[02:40:45.000 --> 02:40:47.000]  of office immediately. Bob Chapman.
[02:40:47.000 --> 02:40:49.000]  Well, you're absolutely right.
[02:40:49.000 --> 02:40:51.000]  And I'm glad
[02:40:51.000 --> 02:40:53.000]  he's doing what he's doing,
[02:40:53.000 --> 02:40:55.000]  because what he's doing
[02:40:55.000 --> 02:40:57.000]  is alienating the American people
[02:40:57.000 --> 02:40:59.000]  who know better.
[02:40:59.000 --> 02:41:01.000]  There was a poll taking
[02:41:01.000 --> 02:41:03.000]  yesterday of the day before
[02:41:03.000 --> 02:41:05.000]  and people were asked
[02:41:05.000 --> 02:41:07.000]  in the survey
[02:41:07.000 --> 02:41:09.000]  how do you feel about
[02:41:09.000 --> 02:41:11.000]  the actions by Arizona
[02:41:11.000 --> 02:41:13.000]  in regard to illegal aliens
[02:41:13.000 --> 02:41:15.000]  and their new rules or laws?
[02:41:15.000 --> 02:41:17.000]  4% said
[02:41:17.000 --> 02:41:19.000]  they were against what Arizona was doing.
[02:41:19.000 --> 02:41:21.000]  90%
[02:41:21.000 --> 02:41:23.000]  said they were for it.
[02:41:23.000 --> 02:41:25.000]  I've never seen any survey
[02:41:25.000 --> 02:41:27.000]  that was that staggering.
[02:41:27.000 --> 02:41:29.000]  I know that we
[02:41:29.000 --> 02:41:31.000]  saw some votes,
[02:41:31.000 --> 02:41:33.000]  indications of how people think
[02:41:33.000 --> 02:41:35.000]  when they were
[02:41:35.000 --> 02:41:37.000]  polling for the
[02:41:37.000 --> 02:41:39.000]  people to see how they felt about
[02:41:39.000 --> 02:41:41.000]  the Federal Reserve being audited
[02:41:41.000 --> 02:41:43.000]  and investigated, and the polls
[02:41:43.000 --> 02:41:45.000]  were ran anywhere from 78 to
[02:41:45.000 --> 02:41:47.000]  82%, which really surprised me.
[02:41:47.000 --> 02:41:49.000]  But 90%,
[02:41:49.000 --> 02:41:51.000]  I think if the President's
[02:41:51.000 --> 02:41:53.000]  going the wrong way on this issue
[02:41:53.000 --> 02:41:55.000]  at the wrong time,
[02:41:55.000 --> 02:41:57.000]  this thing could blow up in his face.
[02:41:57.000 --> 02:41:59.000]  Well, I agree. And he's also
[02:41:59.000 --> 02:42:01.000]  involved in a mass hoax
[02:42:01.000 --> 02:42:03.000]  in his speech. I've got the text
[02:42:03.000 --> 02:42:05.000]  of it here in my stack. He said,
[02:42:05.000 --> 02:42:07.000]  Latino, Hispanic Americans
[02:42:07.000 --> 02:42:09.000]  want this, and it's the right thing
[02:42:09.000 --> 02:42:11.000]  to do. And then the article in Reuters
[02:42:11.000 --> 02:42:13.000]  that had his quotes said, yes,
[02:42:13.000 --> 02:42:15.000]  he's doing this ahead of an election
[02:42:15.000 --> 02:42:17.000]  for Hispanic votes. I've seen
[02:42:17.000 --> 02:42:19.000]  polls of 70%, 75%,
[02:42:19.000 --> 02:42:21.000]  81% of Hispanics who are Americans.
[02:42:21.000 --> 02:42:23.000]  They're as red-blooded as anybody else.
[02:42:23.000 --> 02:42:25.000]  They know Mexico's collapsing.
[02:42:25.000 --> 02:42:27.000]  They know the Southwest is uninhabitable
[02:42:27.000 --> 02:42:29.000]  on the border. They know the illegal
[02:42:29.000 --> 02:42:31.000]  aliens are driving down the wages.
[02:42:31.000 --> 02:42:33.000]  We don't hate the illegal aliens.
[02:42:33.000 --> 02:42:35.000]  We just know they're being used as a political weapon
[02:42:35.000 --> 02:42:37.000]  to bring down this country. They know
[02:42:37.000 --> 02:42:39.000]  46 states are on the verge of going bankrupt.
[02:42:39.000 --> 02:42:41.000]  They know Schwarzenegger just told 200-plus
[02:42:41.000 --> 02:42:43.000]  thousand employees they're going to have to get
[02:42:43.000 --> 02:42:45.000]  wages cut from 20 bucks an hour,
[02:42:45.000 --> 02:42:47.000]  which you can barely live on in California
[02:42:47.000 --> 02:42:49.000]  in many areas, down to $6 an hour.
[02:42:49.000 --> 02:42:51.000]  They know we're bankrupt. Folks,
[02:42:51.000 --> 02:42:53.000]  we're sinking. We're a lifeboat piled up
[02:42:53.000 --> 02:42:55.000]  with the welfare state.
[02:42:55.000 --> 02:42:57.000]  I mean, it is insane
[02:42:57.000 --> 02:42:59.000]  to see this guy say there's no border
[02:42:59.000 --> 02:43:01.000]  problem. The border is quite
[02:43:01.000 --> 02:43:03.000]  secure when it is
[02:43:03.000 --> 02:43:05.000]  bedlam. I mean, folks, it is
[02:43:05.000 --> 02:43:07.000]  bedlam. One-third
[02:43:07.000 --> 02:43:09.000]  of Arizona is now denied
[02:43:09.000 --> 02:43:11.000]  to law enforcement. They have signs
[02:43:11.000 --> 02:43:13.000]  on highways and national parks saying don't go
[02:43:13.000 --> 02:43:15.000]  in.
[02:43:15.000 --> 02:43:17.000]  I mean, every week people have their farms
[02:43:17.000 --> 02:43:19.000]  burned down and ranchers are being killed.
[02:43:19.000 --> 02:43:21.000]  There is a La Ricanquista La Infasora
[02:43:21.000 --> 02:43:23.000]  going on
[02:43:23.000 --> 02:43:25.000]  and it is a nightmare. I mean, Bob,
[02:43:25.000 --> 02:43:27.000]  I know I'm ranting here. I just cannot believe
[02:43:27.000 --> 02:43:29.000]  how crazy this is.
[02:43:29.000 --> 02:43:31.000]  Well, you should be
[02:43:31.000 --> 02:43:33.000]  and you should say what you're saying.
[02:43:33.000 --> 02:43:35.000]  And if I'm not
[02:43:35.000 --> 02:43:37.000]  mistaken, didn't we have
[02:43:37.000 --> 02:43:39.000]  in the last day or two
[02:43:39.000 --> 02:43:41.000]  on the Mexican side of the border
[02:43:41.000 --> 02:43:43.000]  a large gunfight
[02:43:43.000 --> 02:43:45.000]  between two warring cartels
[02:43:45.000 --> 02:43:47.000]  where a number of people were killed?
[02:43:47.000 --> 02:43:49.000]  No, the cops are being killed.
[02:43:49.000 --> 02:43:51.000]  It's just, it's ongoing.
[02:43:51.000 --> 02:43:53.000]  But I mean, the issue is the majority of Hispanics
[02:43:53.000 --> 02:43:55.000]  want the border shut and the media runs this hoax
[02:43:55.000 --> 02:43:57.000]  that it's racist if you want to have a border
[02:43:57.000 --> 02:43:59.000]  when every other country has one.
[02:43:59.000 --> 02:44:01.000]  It's racist. It's like, you don't want health care
[02:44:01.000 --> 02:44:03.000]  run by the government. You know, raise your taxes,
[02:44:03.000 --> 02:44:05.000]  cut the benefits. You're racist.
[02:44:05.000 --> 02:44:07.000]  You don't want to have war with Iran. You're racist.
[02:44:07.000 --> 02:44:09.000]  You don't want to give up all your property.
[02:44:09.000 --> 02:44:11.000]  Racist. You don't want your taxes raised.
[02:44:11.000 --> 02:44:13.000]  I mean, racist. What in
[02:44:13.000 --> 02:44:15.000]  Hades is that have to do with it?
[02:44:15.000 --> 02:44:17.000]  That little establishment
[02:44:17.000 --> 02:44:19.000]  knuckle-draggers, slimeball, Chris Matthews
[02:44:19.000 --> 02:44:21.000]  knows full well what he's doing
[02:44:21.000 --> 02:44:23.000]  when he invokes racism.
[02:44:23.000 --> 02:44:25.000]  He is a race pimp. He is the racist.
[02:44:27.000 --> 02:44:29.000]  And that's true. And that's why
[02:44:29.000 --> 02:44:31.000]  he does that is because he gets paid to do it.
[02:44:31.000 --> 02:44:33.000]  And there's too many people in the world
[02:44:33.000 --> 02:44:35.000]  like that and there's nothing we can do
[02:44:35.000 --> 02:44:37.000]  about harnessing people like that.
[02:44:37.000 --> 02:44:39.000]  But I hope
[02:44:39.000 --> 02:44:41.000]  Stark continues to shoot his mouth
[02:44:41.000 --> 02:44:43.000]  off and be the arrogant little
[02:44:43.000 --> 02:44:45.000]  puke that he is.
[02:44:45.000 --> 02:44:47.000]  It's very important because he just
[02:44:47.000 --> 02:44:49.000]  alienates more and more people
[02:44:49.000 --> 02:44:51.000]  and they got to go to the polls
[02:44:51.000 --> 02:44:53.000]  and he's no longer going to be a congressman
[02:44:53.000 --> 02:44:55.000]  and there's going to be a lot
[02:44:55.000 --> 02:44:57.000]  of people who are going to be
[02:44:57.000 --> 02:44:59.000]  we'll call it diselected.
[02:44:59.000 --> 02:45:01.000]  They're so arrogant though. They're like on
[02:45:01.000 --> 02:45:03.000]  I don't understand power trips.
[02:45:03.000 --> 02:45:05.000]  I just don't understand it. I mean
[02:45:05.000 --> 02:45:07.000]  I had a power trip when I was 18 years old
[02:45:07.000 --> 02:45:09.000]  as I've actually gotten power. I've been freaked out
[02:45:09.000 --> 02:45:11.000]  by it and realized the responsibility.
[02:45:11.000 --> 02:45:13.000]  Who are these people that just
[02:45:13.000 --> 02:45:15.000]  I mean I would be embarrassed to have red
[02:45:15.000 --> 02:45:17.000]  carpets and marching bands and
[02:45:17.000 --> 02:45:19.000]  everyone kissing my rump. They just love it
[02:45:19.000 --> 02:45:21.000]  though Bob.
[02:45:21.000 --> 02:45:23.000]  Well, there's some people that do
[02:45:23.000 --> 02:45:25.000]  and it all ends up at
[02:45:25.000 --> 02:45:27.000]  some bad end.
[02:45:27.000 --> 02:45:29.000]  Even Cicero ended up badly
[02:45:29.000 --> 02:45:31.000]  as powerful
[02:45:31.000 --> 02:45:33.000]  and as talented as he was.
[02:45:33.000 --> 02:45:35.000]  And so
[02:45:35.000 --> 02:45:37.000]  all men
[02:45:37.000 --> 02:45:39.000]  and we'll just use men, have clay feet
[02:45:39.000 --> 02:45:41.000]  and they don't realize it.
[02:45:41.000 --> 02:45:43.000]  And your comment
[02:45:43.000 --> 02:45:45.000]  about the responsibility that goes along
[02:45:45.000 --> 02:45:47.000]  with the things that you
[02:45:47.000 --> 02:45:49.000]  and I do is extraordinarily
[02:45:49.000 --> 02:45:51.000]  succinct.
[02:45:51.000 --> 02:45:53.000]  It's very important
[02:45:53.000 --> 02:45:55.000]  that you realize
[02:45:55.000 --> 02:45:57.000]  that and in people in the position
[02:45:57.000 --> 02:45:59.000]  that you and I are in, that
[02:45:59.000 --> 02:46:01.000]  we have a great
[02:46:01.000 --> 02:46:03.000]  responsibility and burden to carry
[02:46:03.000 --> 02:46:05.000]  which we have voluntarily
[02:46:05.000 --> 02:46:07.000]  assumed.
[02:46:07.000 --> 02:46:09.000]  And I think that's very, very
[02:46:09.000 --> 02:46:11.000]  important and it bears out
[02:46:11.000 --> 02:46:13.000]  why we insist on
[02:46:13.000 --> 02:46:15.000]  telling the truth and turning
[02:46:15.000 --> 02:46:17.000]  over every stone so that we can
[02:46:17.000 --> 02:46:19.000]  find any skull-duggery that's
[02:46:19.000 --> 02:46:21.000]  going on. Sometimes
[02:46:21.000 --> 02:46:23.000]  I think my publication, The International
[02:46:23.000 --> 02:46:25.000]  Forecaster, should be
[02:46:25.000 --> 02:46:27.000]  renamed the financial inquirer
[02:46:27.000 --> 02:46:29.000]  because
[02:46:29.000 --> 02:46:31.000]  if you really want to know
[02:46:31.000 --> 02:46:33.000]  what's going on around the world, it's important
[02:46:33.000 --> 02:46:35.000]  in the realm of skull-duggery
[02:46:35.000 --> 02:46:37.000]  we cover it.
[02:46:37.000 --> 02:46:39.000]  But these people
[02:46:39.000 --> 02:46:41.000]  when they use
[02:46:41.000 --> 02:46:43.000]  this arrogance
[02:46:43.000 --> 02:46:45.000]  and we'll capsilize it within that word
[02:46:45.000 --> 02:46:47.000]  all they're doing
[02:46:47.000 --> 02:46:49.000]  is bringing more
[02:46:49.000 --> 02:46:51.000]  trouble down upon their heads
[02:46:51.000 --> 02:46:53.000]  and it's going to bury them.
[02:46:53.000 --> 02:46:55.000]  Well, I mean, it enrages me
[02:46:55.000 --> 02:46:57.000]  to Obama playing golf every day
[02:46:57.000 --> 02:46:59.000]  to have read about Bush
[02:46:59.000 --> 02:47:01.000]  taking two naps and working out for
[02:47:01.000 --> 02:47:03.000]  three hours a day. I mean, I feel like
[02:47:03.000 --> 02:47:05.000]  with the responsibility I have, I catch myself
[02:47:05.000 --> 02:47:07.000]  working 10, 12, 13, 14, 18
[02:47:07.000 --> 02:47:09.000]  sometimes 24 hours
[02:47:09.000 --> 02:47:11.000]  not sleeping.
[02:47:11.000 --> 02:47:13.000]  I had to quit that a few years ago. It was so bad
[02:47:13.000 --> 02:47:15.000]  for me physically, you know, to work
[02:47:15.000 --> 02:47:17.000]  24 hours straight all the time,
[02:47:17.000 --> 02:47:19.000]  I mean routinely.
[02:47:19.000 --> 02:47:21.000]  But I feel like a responsive, I feel guilty
[02:47:21.000 --> 02:47:23.000]  when I'm not fighting these people because I know how serious
[02:47:23.000 --> 02:47:25.000]  it is. And to watch them
[02:47:25.000 --> 02:47:27.000]  having these concerts at the White House
[02:47:27.000 --> 02:47:29.000]  and the BP guys sailing his yacht
[02:47:29.000 --> 02:47:31.000]  and just to see
[02:47:31.000 --> 02:47:33.000]  how they enjoy it.
[02:47:33.000 --> 02:47:35.000]  And they laugh at the public
[02:47:35.000 --> 02:47:37.000]  and they just are
[02:47:37.000 --> 02:47:39.000]  sacks of
[02:47:39.000 --> 02:47:41.000]  ugh, they make me, I mean, I just
[02:47:41.000 --> 02:47:43.000]  why is it, Bob, that in history
[02:47:43.000 --> 02:47:45.000]  the arrogant, power-lusting
[02:47:45.000 --> 02:47:47.000]  trash almost
[02:47:47.000 --> 02:47:49.000]  always takes control? I mean, why can't
[02:47:49.000 --> 02:47:51.000]  we just grow up as a society
[02:47:51.000 --> 02:47:53.000]  and take care
[02:47:53.000 --> 02:47:55.000]  of these people? I mean, why can't we get
[02:47:55.000 --> 02:47:57.000]  our business together?
[02:47:57.000 --> 02:47:59.000]  It's the evolutionary
[02:47:59.000 --> 02:48:01.000]  process of man
[02:48:01.000 --> 02:48:03.000]  and you have
[02:48:03.000 --> 02:48:05.000]  a great middle among humanity
[02:48:05.000 --> 02:48:07.000]  and then you have the good guys
[02:48:07.000 --> 02:48:09.000]  and the bad guys and
[02:48:09.000 --> 02:48:11.000]  their eternal fight goes on forever
[02:48:11.000 --> 02:48:13.000]  and this is nothing new, you know that
[02:48:13.000 --> 02:48:15.000]  and what's going to happen
[02:48:15.000 --> 02:48:17.000]  is we're going to go head to head all the way
[02:48:17.000 --> 02:48:19.000]  and good will win.
[02:48:19.000 --> 02:48:21.000]  We will win.
[02:48:21.000 --> 02:48:23.000]  There's no way we're not going to win.
[02:48:23.000 --> 02:48:25.000]  What the price is we have
[02:48:25.000 --> 02:48:27.000]  to pay, it's irrelevant.
[02:48:27.000 --> 02:48:29.000]  Absolutely irrelevant.
[02:48:29.000 --> 02:48:31.000]  And I guess life really is about that journey
[02:48:31.000 --> 02:48:33.000]  and which side you choose to be a part of
[02:48:33.000 --> 02:48:35.000]  good or evil and the Bible says
[02:48:35.000 --> 02:48:37.000]  you were hot and cold, I spit you out of my mouth.
[02:48:37.000 --> 02:48:39.000]  So many people
[02:48:39.000 --> 02:48:41.000]  are good at their core, they want to be good people
[02:48:41.000 --> 02:48:43.000]  but they choose to sit on the fence
[02:48:43.000 --> 02:48:45.000]  and sitting on the fence means
[02:48:45.000 --> 02:48:47.000]  you've made the decision to join evil
[02:48:47.000 --> 02:48:49.000]  and so I'll tell you, if you're going to sit on the fence
[02:48:49.000 --> 02:48:51.000]  and just kind of all their conspiracy theorist
[02:48:51.000 --> 02:48:53.000]  oh, it's not that bad
[02:48:53.000 --> 02:48:55.000]  you might as well go out and start robbing
[02:48:55.000 --> 02:48:57.000]  banks and I'm not saying
[02:48:57.000 --> 02:48:59.000]  literally, but join the New World Order
[02:48:59.000 --> 02:49:01.000]  because
[02:49:01.000 --> 02:49:03.000]  if you're going to go to hell, you might as well try to
[02:49:03.000 --> 02:49:05.000]  be a general.
[02:49:05.000 --> 02:49:07.000]  You might as well try to go all the way
[02:49:07.000 --> 02:49:09.000]  to the head of the line here.
[02:49:09.000 --> 02:49:11.000]  You people out there who think you can sit in the middle
[02:49:11.000 --> 02:49:13.000]  of the road, that's where the road kill
[02:49:13.000 --> 02:49:15.000]  is, is the middle of the road.
[02:49:15.000 --> 02:49:17.000]  You need to choose a side, folks.
[02:49:17.000 --> 02:49:19.000]  You need to choose a side now.
[02:49:19.000 --> 02:49:21.000]  It is essential that you realize
[02:49:21.000 --> 02:49:23.000]  that you're not a spectator.
[02:49:23.000 --> 02:49:25.000]  Life is not a spectator sport, it's been said many times.
[02:49:25.000 --> 02:49:27.000]  It is not a spectator sport
[02:49:27.000 --> 02:49:29.000]  and so many of you are unfulfilled and unhappy
[02:49:29.000 --> 02:49:31.000]  because you are spectators
[02:49:31.000 --> 02:49:33.000]  and
[02:49:33.000 --> 02:49:35.000]  you don't have rudders
[02:49:35.000 --> 02:49:37.000]  and so many of you have the talents
[02:49:37.000 --> 02:49:39.000]  and the gifts God gave you, you're not
[02:49:39.000 --> 02:49:41.000]  using it. You need to use it.
[02:49:41.000 --> 02:49:43.000]  Any comments on that statement?
[02:49:43.000 --> 02:49:45.000]  Bob Chavin, we're going to come back with two segments of calls.
[02:49:45.000 --> 02:49:47.000]  Well, again,
[02:49:47.000 --> 02:49:49.000]  you're absolutely right
[02:49:49.000 --> 02:49:51.000]  and it's up to us to motivate
[02:49:51.000 --> 02:49:53.000]  people to understand
[02:49:53.000 --> 02:49:55.000]  and want to participate
[02:49:55.000 --> 02:49:57.000]  and
[02:49:57.000 --> 02:49:59.000]  the kind of people you're talking about
[02:49:59.000 --> 02:50:01.000]  have always been with civilization.
[02:50:01.000 --> 02:50:03.000]  God made us all different
[02:50:03.000 --> 02:50:05.000]  and we all have
[02:50:05.000 --> 02:50:07.000]  our limits to what we can do as well
[02:50:07.000 --> 02:50:09.000]  and there are people who recognize
[02:50:09.000 --> 02:50:11.000]  that
[02:50:11.000 --> 02:50:13.000]  the part that they could do might be very small
[02:50:13.000 --> 02:50:15.000]  and they say, well, what the heck
[02:50:15.000 --> 02:50:17.000]  I won't do that.
[02:50:17.000 --> 02:50:19.000]  But it's important that everybody get behind this
[02:50:19.000 --> 02:50:21.000]  because we've got them on the run.
[02:50:21.000 --> 02:50:23.000]  Believe me, the only reason
[02:50:23.000 --> 02:50:25.000]  they're starting that war over there in the Middle East
[02:50:25.000 --> 02:50:27.000]  is to deflect
[02:50:27.000 --> 02:50:29.000]  and keep people's
[02:50:29.000 --> 02:50:31.000]  mind someplace else
[02:50:31.000 --> 02:50:33.000]  worrying about whether there's going to be a draft
[02:50:33.000 --> 02:50:35.000]  and the kids are going to go over and get murdered
[02:50:35.000 --> 02:50:37.000]  and a whole bunch of Muslim kids are going to get murdered.
[02:50:37.000 --> 02:50:39.000]  That's what they're worried about
[02:50:39.000 --> 02:50:41.000]  and the fear
[02:50:41.000 --> 02:50:43.000]  of the economy and the finance
[02:50:43.000 --> 02:50:45.000]  are going to pass.
[02:50:45.000 --> 02:50:47.000]  It's not going to be important.
[02:50:47.000 --> 02:50:49.000]  I once said to an Israeli
[02:50:49.000 --> 02:50:51.000]  the economy is not doing very well
[02:50:51.000 --> 02:50:53.000]  and he said to me, I don't worry about that
[02:50:53.000 --> 02:50:55.000]  I might be dead tomorrow.
[02:50:55.000 --> 02:50:57.000]  We'll be right back. Stay with us.
[02:50:57.000 --> 02:50:59.000]  Bob Chapman, your call is straight ahead
[02:50:59.000 --> 02:51:09.000]  and we'll be right back.
[02:51:29.000 --> 02:51:39.000]  We'll be right back.
[02:52:00.000 --> 02:52:03.000]  The question is where should
[02:52:03.000 --> 02:52:05.000]  the American people draw their line in the sand?
[02:52:05.000 --> 02:52:07.000]  What have we got?
[02:52:07.000 --> 02:52:09.000]  A republic or a monarchy?
[02:52:09.000 --> 02:52:11.000]  A republic is based on a constitution
[02:52:11.000 --> 02:52:13.000]  which protects minority rights.
[02:52:13.000 --> 02:52:15.000]  Not democracy, not mob rule
[02:52:15.000 --> 02:52:17.000]  two wolves and a sheep voting on what's for dinner.
[02:52:17.000 --> 02:52:19.000]  So they think they own our land
[02:52:19.000 --> 02:52:21.000]  they think they own our water, children
[02:52:21.000 --> 02:52:23.000]  our education, our money.
[02:52:23.000 --> 02:52:25.000]  We have to define who we are
[02:52:25.000 --> 02:52:27.000]  and what we will tolerate.
[02:52:27.000 --> 02:52:29.000]  Somebody is going to ask you
[02:52:29.000 --> 02:52:31.000]  what you did during the Patriot uprising
[02:52:31.000 --> 02:52:57.000]  We have the facts. We have the constitution. We have the bill of rights. We have common law.
[02:52:57.000 --> 02:53:03.000]  You've seen our SinoFresh banner on the GCN website.
[02:53:03.000 --> 02:53:05.000]  Yet your sinusitis is still a problem.
[02:53:05.000 --> 02:53:09.000]  Are you waiting for your sinusitis to go away by itself?
[02:53:09.000 --> 02:53:11.000]  Are you waiting for a SinoFresh discount?
[02:53:11.000 --> 02:53:13.000]  Okay, here it comes.
[02:53:13.000 --> 02:53:15.000]  But first, the facts.
[02:53:15.000 --> 02:53:17.000]  67 other products merely treat symptoms
[02:53:17.000 --> 02:53:19.000]  and not the cause of sinus problems.
[02:53:19.000 --> 02:53:21.000]  And 37 million Americans suffer from sinus distress
[02:53:21.000 --> 02:53:23.000]  just like you.
[02:53:23.000 --> 02:53:25.000]  But now many are finding relief
[02:53:25.000 --> 02:53:27.000]  in homeopathic nasal product that antiseptically
[02:53:27.000 --> 02:53:29.000]  eliminates the known causes of sinusitis.
[02:53:29.000 --> 02:53:31.000]  SinoFresh.

[02:53:49.000 --> 02:53:51.000]  Call 888-906-3636
[02:53:51.000 --> 02:53:53.000]  888-906-3636

[02:53:55.000 --> 02:53:57.000]  mention GCN

[02:53:59.000 --> 02:54:25.000]  it works.
[02:54:25.000 --> 02:54:29.000]  We are going to kick the butt of the New World Order together.
[02:54:29.000 --> 02:54:31.000]  If you realize you're part of this victory.
[02:54:31.000 --> 02:54:33.000]  So join the Second Revolution
[02:54:33.000 --> 02:54:35.000]  to restore the Republic.
[02:54:35.000 --> 02:54:37.000]  Join us and come in to be part of the big win.
[02:54:37.000 --> 02:54:39.000]  I'm not rolling over.
[02:54:39.000 --> 02:54:41.000]  Losing is not in the cards
[02:54:41.000 --> 02:54:43.000]  if you take action.
[02:54:43.000 --> 02:54:45.000]  And even if we were going to lose,
[02:54:45.000 --> 02:54:47.000]  I'm not rolling over in licking boats.
[02:54:47.000 --> 02:54:49.000]  Bob Chapman is our guest for this segment
[02:54:49.000 --> 02:54:51.000]  and the next. We have an amazing
[02:54:51.000 --> 02:54:55.000]  filmmaker, the maker of the quintessential film,
[02:54:55.000 --> 02:54:57.000]  The Money Masters.
[02:54:57.000 --> 02:54:59.000]  Got to be 14, 15 years ago
[02:54:59.000 --> 02:55:01.000]  about the entire history of the Federal Reserve,
[02:55:01.000 --> 02:55:03.000]  the New World Order.
[02:55:03.000 --> 02:55:05.000]  I learned so much from this. He's made a new film.
[02:55:05.000 --> 02:55:07.000]  It's been 14 years
[02:55:07.000 --> 02:55:09.000]  and it's out and it's available
[02:55:09.000 --> 02:55:11.000]  at infowars.com.
[02:55:11.000 --> 02:55:13.000]  You can get 25% off the Money Masters
[02:55:13.000 --> 02:55:15.000]  when you get the new film
[02:55:15.000 --> 02:55:17.000]  with it.
[02:55:17.000 --> 02:55:19.000]  But go into your phone calls
[02:55:19.000 --> 02:55:21.000]  Brian and Montreal
[02:55:21.000 --> 02:55:23.000]  and Mike Jossin, Black Patriot.
[02:55:23.000 --> 02:55:25.000]  We'll have time for those four at least
[02:55:25.000 --> 02:55:27.000]  in this segment of the next.
[02:55:27.000 --> 02:55:29.000]  You're on the air with Bob Chapman. Go ahead.
[02:55:29.000 --> 02:55:31.000]  Hi, guys. I was just curious
[02:55:31.000 --> 02:55:33.000]  what you guys thought about the Jerry Cain case
[02:55:33.000 --> 02:55:35.000]  because I know that you published that
[02:55:35.000 --> 02:55:37.000]  on my birthday the 21st of May.
[02:55:37.000 --> 02:55:39.000]  I had received an email probably a few days before
[02:55:39.000 --> 02:55:41.000]  saying that they were just
[02:55:41.000 --> 02:55:43.000]  illegal drug dealers from Mexico
[02:55:43.000 --> 02:55:45.000]  who got shot.
[02:55:45.000 --> 02:55:47.000]  But recently on my site,
[02:55:47.000 --> 02:55:49.000]  we have another story about it
[02:55:49.000 --> 02:55:51.000]  and today we have a troll coming on
[02:55:51.000 --> 02:55:53.000]  trying to tell us that
[02:55:53.000 --> 02:55:55.000]  Jerry and his son were actually bad guys
[02:55:55.000 --> 02:55:57.000]  trying to kill those cops and we all
[02:55:57.000 --> 02:55:59.000]  misunderstand what's going on out there.
[02:55:59.000 --> 02:56:01.000]  Okay. Well, I remember you're talking about the kid
[02:56:01.000 --> 02:56:03.000]  getting a shot on the border.
[02:56:03.000 --> 02:56:05.000]  Yes. Well, I mean, any death is terrible.
[02:56:05.000 --> 02:56:07.000]  And when cops come in
[02:56:07.000 --> 02:56:09.000]  and Taser, some old woman strapped down
[02:56:09.000 --> 02:56:11.000]  in her gurney who's 86 years old
[02:56:11.000 --> 02:56:13.000]  because she yells at him because she's having organ failure
[02:56:13.000 --> 02:56:15.000]  and is delirious.
[02:56:15.000 --> 02:56:17.000]  You know, if you're an autistic kid, I get angry.
[02:56:17.000 --> 02:56:19.000]  But when you're in a war zone on the border
[02:56:19.000 --> 02:56:21.000]  with Mexican troops
[02:56:21.000 --> 02:56:23.000]  and grenade attacks and
[02:56:23.000 --> 02:56:25.000]  death, you know, whenever the Mexican troops
[02:56:25.000 --> 02:56:27.000]  or the Caudes
[02:56:27.000 --> 02:56:29.000]  kill a whole bunch of poor Hispanics,
[02:56:29.000 --> 02:56:31.000]  it's never even in the national news.
[02:56:31.000 --> 02:56:33.000]  It's local news. But then the cops
[02:56:35.000 --> 02:56:37.000]  shoot this teenager
[02:56:37.000 --> 02:56:39.000]  and it becomes this big thing, oh, we got to
[02:56:39.000 --> 02:56:41.000]  get rid of the border. And so what I'm saying
[02:56:41.000 --> 02:56:43.000]  is that's propaganda. It should be
[02:56:43.000 --> 02:56:45.000]  investigated, but I've seen a lot of conflicting stories.
[02:56:45.000 --> 02:56:47.000]  And I don't believe anything that comes out of the
[02:56:47.000 --> 02:56:49.000]  federales. I don't believe anything that comes out of our
[02:56:49.000 --> 02:56:51.000]  police either. But I mean, the federales
[02:56:51.000 --> 02:56:53.000]  are clearly even worse on average.
[02:56:53.000 --> 02:56:55.000]  And I've looked at the case some,
[02:56:55.000 --> 02:56:57.000]  but I don't know what the truth is.
[02:56:57.000 --> 02:56:59.000]  I'm just saying that that's
[02:56:59.000 --> 02:57:01.000]  a war zone down there going
[02:57:01.000 --> 02:57:03.000]  back and forth across that border.
[02:57:03.000 --> 02:57:05.000]  And when a cop gets killed down there,
[02:57:05.000 --> 02:57:07.000]  you never hear about it. Bob Chapman, what's your take
[02:57:07.000 --> 02:57:09.000]  on that case?
[02:57:09.000 --> 02:57:11.000]  Well, I think you're absolutely right again on this one.
[02:57:11.000 --> 02:57:13.000]  And
[02:57:13.000 --> 02:57:15.000]  the police are in Mexico
[02:57:15.000 --> 02:57:17.000]  are corrupt as
[02:57:17.000 --> 02:57:19.000]  is the military. And it's a matter of
[02:57:19.000 --> 02:57:21.000]  historical record.
[02:57:21.000 --> 02:57:23.000]  It's in the open.
[02:57:23.000 --> 02:57:25.000]  Does anybody
[02:57:25.000 --> 02:57:27.000]  who says anything about
[02:57:27.000 --> 02:57:29.000]  what they're doing, they're told to shut up
[02:57:29.000 --> 02:57:31.000]  or they'll get liquidated?
[02:57:31.000 --> 02:57:33.000]  Well, my issue is they claim that our police
[02:57:33.000 --> 02:57:35.000]  killed the kid and called blood the teenager.
[02:57:35.000 --> 02:57:37.000]  And
[02:57:37.000 --> 02:57:39.000]  my issue is that it's
[02:57:39.000 --> 02:57:41.000]  wrong. And I mean, our police are certainly capable
[02:57:41.000 --> 02:57:43.000]  of killing innocent people.
[02:57:43.000 --> 02:57:45.000]  This is what goes on when you militarize police.
[02:57:45.000 --> 02:57:47.000]  I don't know what to say about that case.
[02:57:47.000 --> 02:57:49.000]  So Caller, what do you think? I mean, I don't know.
[02:57:49.000 --> 02:57:51.000]  Well, the information that
[02:57:51.000 --> 02:57:53.000]  I had gotten was that Jerry and his son
[02:57:53.000 --> 02:57:55.000]  were teaching people about how to walk away
[02:57:55.000 --> 02:57:57.000]  from the banks and the NWO propaganda
[02:57:57.000 --> 02:57:59.000]  and that they were set up in Arkansas
[02:57:59.000 --> 02:58:01.000]  and that it was a military
[02:58:01.000 --> 02:58:03.000]  sniper that had fired behind the scenes.
[02:58:03.000 --> 02:58:05.000]  You're talking about a totally different case.
[02:58:05.000 --> 02:58:07.000]  You're talking about that white van getting shot
[02:58:07.000 --> 02:58:09.000]  up, shot up in Arkansas.
[02:58:09.000 --> 02:58:11.000]  For some reason, I thought you were talking about
[02:58:11.000 --> 02:58:13.000]  the Hispanic teenager that got shot on the border.
[02:58:13.000 --> 02:58:15.000]  No, no, no, they were doing that
[02:58:15.000 --> 02:58:17.000]  and that's very suspicious that whole shoot out
[02:58:17.000 --> 02:58:19.000]  and the rest of it. I'm sorry.
[02:58:19.000 --> 02:58:21.000]  I misheard what you were saying, Brian.
[02:58:21.000 --> 02:58:23.000]  So we'll have to talk more about that
[02:58:23.000 --> 02:58:25.000]  on another broadcast.
[02:58:25.000 --> 02:58:27.000]  Kurt Nemo did write a story about that.
[02:58:27.000 --> 02:58:29.000]  He's really the expert on it. I mean, there's so much info, folks.
[02:58:29.000 --> 02:58:31.000]  I can't keep track of it all.
[02:58:31.000 --> 02:58:33.000]  I'm going to be honest with you. We're going to try to jam in
[02:58:33.000 --> 02:58:35.000]  Black Patriot, Josh and Mike
[02:58:35.000 --> 02:58:37.000]  as soon as we come out of rank
[02:58:37.000 --> 02:58:39.000]  in 70 seconds, the fourth hour
[02:58:39.000 --> 02:58:41.000]  is about to start.
[02:58:43.000 --> 02:58:45.000]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[02:58:45.000 --> 02:58:47.000]  Be sure to visit GCNLive.com
[02:58:47.000 --> 02:59:07.000]  today.
[02:59:17.000 --> 02:59:19.000]  Thank you so much for watching.
[02:59:47.000 --> 02:59:49.000]  All right, my friends.
[02:59:49.000 --> 02:59:51.000]  It's the fourth-hand final hour.
[02:59:51.000 --> 02:59:53.000]  Our last second with Bob Chatham
[02:59:53.000 --> 02:59:55.000]  on your phone calls right now.
[02:59:55.000 --> 02:59:57.000]  Black Patriot in New York.
[02:59:57.000 --> 02:59:59.000]  You're on the air. Welcome.
[02:59:59.000 --> 03:00:01.000]  Yes. Hi, Alex.
[03:00:01.000 --> 03:00:03.000]  I'm Hi, Bob Chatham.
[03:00:03.000 --> 03:00:05.000]  Hi, Alex.
[03:00:05.000 --> 03:00:07.000]  Hi, Alex.
[03:00:07.000 --> 03:00:09.000]  Hi, Alex.
[03:00:09.000 --> 03:00:11.000]  Hi, Alex.
[03:00:11.000 --> 03:00:13.000]  Hi, Alex.
[03:00:13.000 --> 03:00:15.000]  Hi, Alex.
[03:00:15.000 --> 03:00:17.000]  Hi, Bob Chatham.
[03:00:17.000 --> 03:00:19.000]  Hi, I just graduated from
[03:00:19.000 --> 03:00:21.000]  high school
[03:00:21.000 --> 03:00:23.000]  and I just want to say that I've been listening
[03:00:23.000 --> 03:00:25.000]  to you Alex for like two years now
[03:00:25.000 --> 03:00:27.000]  and I've been working for
[03:00:27.000 --> 03:00:29.000]  probably four years, but yes,
[03:00:29.000 --> 03:00:31.000]  and I've listened to a lot of what you and Bob Chatham
[03:00:31.000 --> 03:00:33.000]  said and it has helped me a lot, especially in school.
[03:00:33.000 --> 03:00:35.000]  We just took a, I mean,
[03:00:35.000 --> 03:00:37.000]  probably like a month ago,
[03:00:37.000 --> 03:00:39.000]  a national financial literacy
[03:00:39.000 --> 03:00:41.000]  definitely got like a 90% on it.
[03:00:41.000 --> 03:00:43.000]  Even though I'm
[03:00:43.000 --> 03:00:45.000]  talking about it, I had to put
[03:00:45.000 --> 03:00:47.000]  what I thought that they would say,
[03:00:47.000 --> 03:00:49.000]  like about the Federal Reserve,
[03:00:49.000 --> 03:00:51.000]  what it is for and all that stuff.
[03:00:51.000 --> 03:00:53.000]  But like,
[03:00:53.000 --> 03:00:55.000]  I just wanted to say that
[03:00:55.000 --> 03:00:57.000]  like, Alex,
[03:00:57.000 --> 03:00:59.000]  a lot of people who are black,
[03:00:59.000 --> 03:01:01.000]  the lots of that you're talking about,
[03:01:01.000 --> 03:01:03.000]  they're talking about that too,
[03:01:03.000 --> 03:01:05.000]  especially in the little over here.
[03:01:05.000 --> 03:01:07.000]  We know all about all that stuff.
[03:01:07.000 --> 03:01:09.000]  That's what we must know. We talk about that all the time,
[03:01:09.000 --> 03:01:11.000]  the Federal Reserve and so on.
[03:01:11.000 --> 03:01:13.000]  Stuff like the Bullet Group,
[03:01:13.000 --> 03:01:15.000]  which is a traitor to the black people.
[03:01:15.000 --> 03:01:17.000]  And, you know,
[03:01:17.000 --> 03:01:19.000]  I'm just, you know,
[03:01:19.000 --> 03:01:21.000]  I'm just very happy about what you and Bob Chatham
[03:01:21.000 --> 03:01:23.000]  put out there for us, for us every day.
[03:01:23.000 --> 03:01:25.000]  Well, God bless you,
[03:01:25.000 --> 03:01:27.000]  Black Patriot. Good to hear from you.
[03:01:27.000 --> 03:01:29.000]  Bob, we've always had
[03:01:29.000 --> 03:01:31.000]  a huge African-American
[03:01:31.000 --> 03:01:33.000]  listenership African.
[03:01:33.000 --> 03:01:35.000]  We have people in Africa,
[03:01:35.000 --> 03:01:37.000]  in some African countries, we're even higher rated
[03:01:37.000 --> 03:01:39.000]  than we are in the U.S. on Alexa
[03:01:39.000 --> 03:01:41.000]  and so the awakening
[03:01:41.000 --> 03:01:43.000]  is really accelerating
[03:01:43.000 --> 03:01:45.000]  out there in the black community.
[03:01:45.000 --> 03:01:47.000]  And I think you're absolutely right.
[03:01:47.000 --> 03:01:49.000]  I've gone on several times
[03:01:49.000 --> 03:01:51.000]  on WVOM,
[03:01:51.000 --> 03:01:53.000]  I think it is, in Chicago,
[03:01:53.000 --> 03:01:55.000]  which is, I guess, the
[03:01:55.000 --> 03:01:57.000]  largest black station
[03:01:57.000 --> 03:01:59.000]  city of the Jackson
[03:01:59.000 --> 03:02:01.000]  and Mr. Butler,
[03:02:01.000 --> 03:02:03.000]  and I was amazed
[03:02:03.000 --> 03:02:05.000]  at what these people,
[03:02:05.000 --> 03:02:07.000]  I had three women in a row called
[03:02:07.000 --> 03:02:09.000]  Chatham, who was on
[03:02:09.000 --> 03:02:11.000]  and asked me about the Illuminati
[03:02:11.000 --> 03:02:13.000]  and they really knew about it
[03:02:13.000 --> 03:02:15.000]  and so what the young man is saying
[03:02:15.000 --> 03:02:17.000]  is absolutely true and we love you all,
[03:02:17.000 --> 03:02:19.000]  we want you to listen.
[03:02:19.000 --> 03:02:21.000]  Absolutely, you know, it's exciting.
[03:02:21.000 --> 03:02:23.000]  On average, when I've been on black stations,
[03:02:23.000 --> 03:02:25.000]  their callers are much more informed
[03:02:25.000 --> 03:02:27.000]  than kind of mainline audiences,
[03:02:27.000 --> 03:02:29.000]  but that's changing.
[03:02:29.000 --> 03:02:31.000]  We want everybody to know what's going on.
[03:02:31.000 --> 03:02:33.000]  But see, black folks
[03:02:33.000 --> 03:02:35.000]  aren't as naive as some people
[03:02:35.000 --> 03:02:37.000]  who think just because they're white,
[03:02:37.000 --> 03:02:39.000]  they're going to be protected.
[03:02:39.000 --> 03:02:41.000]  That's not how this works.
[03:02:41.000 --> 03:02:43.000]  Mike in California, you're on the air with Bob Chapman.
[03:02:43.000 --> 03:02:45.000]  Go ahead.
[03:02:45.000 --> 03:02:47.000]  How was your day, Mr. Jones?
[03:02:47.000 --> 03:02:49.000]  Good, good to talk to you. What's on your mind?
[03:02:49.000 --> 03:02:51.000]  I got a couple of comments
[03:02:51.000 --> 03:02:53.000]  and then two that I think are important questions,
[03:02:53.000 --> 03:02:55.000]  but let's move quick. Go ahead.
[03:02:55.000 --> 03:02:57.000]  Sure thing.
[03:02:57.000 --> 03:02:59.000]  The word inalienable doesn't seem to be used
[03:02:59.000 --> 03:03:01.000]  by much by anybody except you.
[03:03:01.000 --> 03:03:03.000]  If these flying evil flying monkeys
[03:03:03.000 --> 03:03:05.000]  are from Obama saying we can just drag you off
[03:03:05.000 --> 03:03:07.000]  and whatever, I'm not going to let them.
[03:03:07.000 --> 03:03:09.000]  How do I address them and tell them
[03:03:09.000 --> 03:03:11.000]  no, you're not because I'm going to remove
[03:03:11.000 --> 03:03:13.000]  parts of your body and hand them back to you?
[03:03:13.000 --> 03:03:15.000]  Well, inalienable means this is supreme.
[03:03:15.000 --> 03:03:17.000]  No one can change this.
[03:03:17.000 --> 03:03:19.000]  This predates the Bill of Rights
[03:03:19.000 --> 03:03:21.000]  and Constitution. It only points that out.
[03:03:21.000 --> 03:03:23.000]  And you cross this line,
[03:03:23.000 --> 03:03:25.000]  you cross in the line of tyrants,
[03:03:25.000 --> 03:03:27.000]  and it's not just my right, it's my duty.
[03:03:27.000 --> 03:03:29.000]  It's the Declaration of Independence.
[03:03:29.000 --> 03:03:31.000]  It's what July forced about, folks,
[03:03:31.000 --> 03:03:33.000]  it's my duty to stop you.
[03:03:33.000 --> 03:03:35.000]  Now, they're going to call that terrorism.
[03:03:35.000 --> 03:03:37.000]  It's our job to reach out to the police
[03:03:37.000 --> 03:03:39.000]  who are just like the public.
[03:03:39.000 --> 03:03:41.000]  They're dumber than dirt and to inform them.
[03:03:41.000 --> 03:03:43.000]  Bob Chapman.
[03:03:43.000 --> 03:03:45.000]  I agree.
[03:03:45.000 --> 03:03:47.000]  And I think that informing,
[03:03:47.000 --> 03:03:49.000]  informing, informing is what this is all about.
[03:03:49.000 --> 03:03:51.000]  And that's why we're on here.
[03:03:51.000 --> 03:03:53.000]  They give everybody a voice that we can
[03:03:53.000 --> 03:03:55.000]  and update everybody
[03:03:55.000 --> 03:03:57.000]  about what's going on
[03:03:57.000 --> 03:03:59.000]  and what's important and what you got to know.
[03:03:59.000 --> 03:04:01.000]  Now, this is serious stuff, folks.
[03:04:01.000 --> 03:04:03.000]  You've heard us lay it all out for decades.
[03:04:03.000 --> 03:04:05.000]  Bob, for 40-something years,
[03:04:05.000 --> 03:04:07.000]  it's all coming true, exactly like we said it would,
[03:04:07.000 --> 03:04:09.000]  because we're reading
[03:04:09.000 --> 03:04:11.000]  the enemy's playbook.
[03:04:11.000 --> 03:04:13.000]  I mean, it's very elementary.
[03:04:13.000 --> 03:04:15.000]  Anything else, Mike?
[03:04:15.000 --> 03:04:17.000]  Yes, sir, two couple of quick things I'll get through.
[03:04:17.000 --> 03:04:19.000]  I'll scamper on them.
[03:04:19.000 --> 03:04:21.000]  I'm recommending World Prayer
[03:04:21.000 --> 03:04:23.000]  to disrupt their functions and systems.
[03:04:23.000 --> 03:04:25.000]  I think it's a real good idea.
[03:04:25.000 --> 03:04:27.000]  I pray every damn night to beat these monkeys.
[03:04:27.000 --> 03:04:29.000]  How do we identify
[03:04:29.000 --> 03:04:31.000]  what foods are GMO foods?
[03:04:31.000 --> 03:04:33.000]  And so this is kind of a big, eating week.
[03:04:33.000 --> 03:04:35.000]  That's a great question.
[03:04:35.000 --> 03:04:37.000]  I'm going to have to cover that later in the hour.
[03:04:37.000 --> 03:04:39.000]  I'm going to write a note on that.
[03:04:39.000 --> 03:04:41.000]  And we're going to get to Josh and everybody else.
[03:04:41.000 --> 03:04:43.000]  But that's a very big issue,
[03:04:43.000 --> 03:04:45.000]  and I appreciate your call.
[03:04:45.000 --> 03:04:47.000]  Bob Chapman, hopefully I'll see you next week.
[03:04:47.000 --> 03:04:49.000]  Lord Willingham, we're both still here,
[03:04:49.000 --> 03:04:51.000]  and it's always great to have you on.
[03:04:51.000 --> 03:04:53.000]  We'll talk to you next week.
[03:04:53.000 --> 03:04:55.000]  Thank you very much, and thank you all for listening.
[03:04:55.000 --> 03:04:57.000]  Thank you, Bob.
[03:04:57.000 --> 03:04:59.000]  We'll be back for the balance of the broadcast.
[03:04:59.000 --> 03:05:28.000]  We have 52 minutes left in transmission.
[03:05:29.000 --> 03:05:31.000]  Individual readers from every walk of life
[03:05:31.000 --> 03:05:34.000]  can put the Trends Journal Trends forecast
[03:05:34.000 --> 03:05:36.000]  and Trends Analysis to practical use.
[03:05:36.000 --> 03:05:39.000]  Extra information to keep you well informed throughout the year.
[03:05:39.000 --> 03:05:42.000]  When any current event of major social-economic
[03:05:42.000 --> 03:05:44.000]  or political significance occurs,
[03:05:44.000 --> 03:05:47.000]  Trends Journal notifies its subscribers of their implications.

[03:05:57.000 --> 03:06:00.000]  This information is too important to wait.
[03:06:00.000 --> 03:06:02.000]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons
[03:06:02.000 --> 03:06:04.000]  you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[03:06:04.000 --> 03:06:06.000]  Number one, new climate legislation
[03:06:06.000 --> 03:06:09.000]  could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[03:06:09.000 --> 03:06:11.000]  Number two, our new energy czar
[03:06:11.000 --> 03:06:14.000]  wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[03:06:14.000 --> 03:06:17.000]  It's true, total government control of electricity
[03:06:17.000 --> 03:06:20.000]  in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[03:06:20.000 --> 03:06:22.000]  Number three, in some areas of the country,
[03:06:22.000 --> 03:06:24.000]  the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[03:06:24.000 --> 03:06:27.000]  And now, new socialist legislation
[03:06:27.000 --> 03:06:29.000]  is only compounding the problem.
[03:06:29.000 --> 03:06:32.000]  Number four, dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[03:06:32.000 --> 03:06:34.000]  Every year, thousands of families
[03:06:34.000 --> 03:06:36.000]  lose their power from weather-related onages.
[03:06:36.000 --> 03:06:38.000]  Number five, a solar power generator
[03:06:38.000 --> 03:06:41.000]  provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind.
[03:06:41.000 --> 03:06:43.000]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators
[03:06:43.000 --> 03:06:46.000]  offered by Solutions from Science, one of my old sponsors.
[03:06:46.000 --> 03:06:50.000]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.

[03:07:00.000 --> 03:07:02.000]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones,
[03:07:02.000 --> 03:07:04.000]  asking you for a minute of your time to tell you about soap.
[03:07:04.000 --> 03:07:07.000]  Not detergents, but good old-fashioned pure soap
[03:07:07.000 --> 03:07:09.000]  made by the Calvin Soap Company,
[03:07:09.000 --> 03:07:11.000]  a family-owned and operated American company.
[03:07:11.000 --> 03:07:13.000]  My family, staff, friends, and radio listeners
[03:07:13.000 --> 03:07:16.000]  are constantly telling me how much they love these products
[03:07:16.000 --> 03:07:18.000]  for bath, air, laundry, and dishes.
[03:07:18.000 --> 03:07:20.000]  There is nothing like these factory direct,
[03:07:20.000 --> 03:07:23.000]  big-money-saving, triple-concentrated soaps anywhere.

[03:07:32.000 --> 03:07:34.000]  Let's talk to the owner of Five Star Soap, Marty Schachter,
[03:07:34.000 --> 03:07:36.000]  and see what he has to say.
[03:07:36.000 --> 03:07:39.000]  As founder and owner for over 63 years,
[03:07:39.000 --> 03:07:41.000]  people keep asking me,
[03:07:41.000 --> 03:07:43.000]  how's business?
[03:07:43.000 --> 03:07:46.000]  I'm happy to say our business is going down the drain.
[03:07:46.000 --> 03:07:51.000]  Call us at 1-800-340-7091

[03:07:58.000 --> 03:08:00.000]  Thank you.
[03:08:02.000 --> 03:08:04.000]  From his Central Texas Command Center
[03:08:04.000 --> 03:08:06.000]  deep behind enemy lines,
[03:08:06.000 --> 03:08:09.000]  the Information War continues.
[03:08:09.000 --> 03:08:19.000]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[03:08:19.000 --> 03:08:24.000]  Well, for the next 52 minutes, we're joined by Bill Still.
[03:08:24.000 --> 03:08:26.000]  I remember, I was already awake.
[03:08:26.000 --> 03:08:28.000]  I knew what was going on.
[03:08:28.000 --> 03:08:30.000]  I'd been on the air about two years,
[03:08:30.000 --> 03:08:33.000]  and I saw the documentary film, The Money Masters,
[03:08:33.000 --> 03:08:35.000]  and we played clips on it over and over again
[03:08:35.000 --> 03:08:38.000]  on my radio show and my local access television show.
[03:08:38.000 --> 03:08:40.000]  We started out here in Austin,
[03:08:40.000 --> 03:08:43.000]  and we sell the film, it's over three hours long.
[03:08:43.000 --> 03:08:46.000]  The Money Masters, how banks create the world's money
[03:08:46.000 --> 03:08:48.000]  and use it to take over the planet.
[03:08:48.000 --> 03:08:51.000]  And the banks, by the way, are run by eugenicists,
[03:08:51.000 --> 03:08:53.000]  so that's why it's even more dangerous
[03:08:53.000 --> 03:08:57.000]  that they be stopped because these are maniacal people.
[03:08:57.000 --> 03:09:02.000]  And it is two DVD sets, an incredible film, so important.
[03:09:02.000 --> 03:09:05.000]  Well, guess what? After all these years,
[03:09:05.000 --> 03:09:08.000]  he made a new documentary, The Secret of Oz.
[03:09:08.000 --> 03:09:10.000]  And he talks about, you know,
[03:09:10.000 --> 03:09:14.000]  is the Wizard of Oz really a secret message
[03:09:14.000 --> 03:09:16.000]  about the banking cartel?
[03:09:16.000 --> 03:09:18.000]  Well, I know it's not a secret message,
[03:09:18.000 --> 03:09:19.000]  and the film explains that.
[03:09:19.000 --> 03:09:23.000]  Actually, it's a play from the 1890s that exposes.
[03:09:23.000 --> 03:09:25.000]  In fact, I've actually read the original play.
[03:09:25.000 --> 03:09:26.000]  It's very similar to the film,
[03:09:26.000 --> 03:09:28.000]  but it admits it's about the Wizard of Oz
[03:09:28.000 --> 03:09:31.000]  and the bankers behind the curtain creating the fraud
[03:09:31.000 --> 03:09:33.000]  and getting rid of the gold standard
[03:09:33.000 --> 03:09:35.000]  and the Yellowbrook Road.
[03:09:35.000 --> 03:09:38.000]  So the film exposes these scallywags,
[03:09:38.000 --> 03:09:40.000]  these Ponzi scheme operators,
[03:09:40.000 --> 03:09:42.000]  who have now brought us to the point of
[03:09:42.000 --> 03:09:45.000]  world government run by them through their fraud
[03:09:45.000 --> 03:09:48.000]  and the devaluation of the dollar.
[03:09:48.000 --> 03:09:50.000]  And so it's important to expose what they've done,
[03:09:50.000 --> 03:09:53.000]  but it's also important to expose alternatives
[03:09:53.000 --> 03:09:57.000]  to their predatory financial black hole system
[03:09:57.000 --> 03:09:59.000]  that is designed to destroy societies.
[03:09:59.000 --> 03:10:01.000]  And this film is incredible.
[03:10:01.000 --> 03:10:03.000]  It just came out on DVD.
[03:10:03.000 --> 03:10:04.000]  We've got it.
[03:10:04.000 --> 03:10:06.000]  It's available at infowars.com.
[03:10:06.000 --> 03:10:07.000]  The secret of Oz.
[03:10:07.000 --> 03:10:09.000]  We'll put the shopping cart image up there
[03:10:09.000 --> 03:10:11.000]  for prisonplanet.tv viewers,
[03:10:11.000 --> 03:10:13.000]  and you can get 25% off the Money Masters
[03:10:13.000 --> 03:10:18.000]  when you order it with the secret of Oz.
[03:10:18.000 --> 03:10:20.000]  And this film is so well done.
[03:10:20.000 --> 03:10:22.000]  He's such an amazing filmmaker.
[03:10:22.000 --> 03:10:25.000]  He's got so many big heavy hitters in the film
[03:10:25.000 --> 03:10:29.000]  explaining it and going over it like Peter Schiff,
[03:10:29.000 --> 03:10:32.000]  Joe Farah, it's just amazing.
[03:10:32.000 --> 03:10:34.000]  And it has solutions.
[03:10:34.000 --> 03:10:36.000]  So it shows you who the enemy is, what they've done,
[03:10:36.000 --> 03:10:38.000]  and the alternative.
[03:10:38.000 --> 03:10:40.000]  And people are now, more than ever,
[03:10:40.000 --> 03:10:42.000]  ready for this information.
[03:10:42.000 --> 03:10:44.000]  So get the new film at infowars.com.
[03:10:44.000 --> 03:10:46.000]  I want to play the little four-minute trailer
[03:10:46.000 --> 03:10:49.000]  or part of it to the secret of Oz.
[03:10:49.000 --> 03:10:51.000]  Then we're going to go to Bill Still,
[03:10:51.000 --> 03:10:52.000]  the amazing filmmaker.
[03:10:52.000 --> 03:10:54.000]  Here it is.
[03:10:54.000 --> 03:10:57.000]  What's going on with the American economy?
[03:10:57.000 --> 03:10:59.000]  For closures are everywhere,
[03:10:59.000 --> 03:11:01.000]  unemployment is skyrocketing,
[03:11:01.000 --> 03:11:03.000]  and it looks like this may only be the beginning.
[03:11:03.000 --> 03:11:05.000]  What can government do?
[03:11:05.000 --> 03:11:08.000]  The sad answer is, under our current monetary system,
[03:11:08.000 --> 03:11:09.000]  nothing.
[03:11:09.000 --> 03:11:11.000]  It's not going to get any better
[03:11:11.000 --> 03:11:13.000]  until the root cause of the problem
[03:11:13.000 --> 03:11:15.000]  is understood and addressed.
[03:11:15.000 --> 03:11:17.000]  There isn't enough stimulus money
[03:11:17.000 --> 03:11:20.000]  in the entire world to get us out of this hole.
[03:11:20.000 --> 03:11:23.000]  Well, you can't borrow yourself out of debt.
[03:11:23.000 --> 03:11:25.000]  No more than, like I said before,
[03:11:25.000 --> 03:11:27.000]  not drink yourself sober.
[03:11:27.000 --> 03:11:30.000]  And so we're going to have a massive, massive recession
[03:11:30.000 --> 03:11:32.000]  or let's call it a depression,
[03:11:32.000 --> 03:11:36.000]  while the economy rebalances away from a service sector economy
[03:11:36.000 --> 03:11:38.000]  towards a good producing economy.
[03:11:38.000 --> 03:11:40.000]  But could it be that all these problems
[03:11:40.000 --> 03:11:42.000]  were foreseen 100 years ago
[03:11:42.000 --> 03:11:46.000]  by L. Frank Baum, the author of The Wonderful Wizard of Oz?
[03:11:46.000 --> 03:11:51.000]  Well, the principle and most powerful symbolic reference
[03:11:51.000 --> 03:11:55.000]  are, of course, the Yellow Brick Road and the Silver Slippers.
[03:11:55.000 --> 03:11:58.000]  In the book version of The Wizard of Oz,
[03:11:58.000 --> 03:12:00.000]  Dorothy Slippers are made of silver,
[03:12:00.000 --> 03:12:02.000]  as opposed to in the film version
[03:12:02.000 --> 03:12:05.000]  where Dorothy Slippers are made of ruby.
[03:12:05.000 --> 03:12:08.000]  You take away the Silver Slippers on the gold or yellow brick road,
[03:12:08.000 --> 03:12:11.000]  and all of the other symbolism tends to be lost.
[03:12:11.000 --> 03:12:14.000]  Well, it's no secret to any American
[03:12:14.000 --> 03:12:16.000]  that we're living in very precarious times.
[03:12:16.000 --> 03:12:19.000]  Americans are being robbed blind,
[03:12:19.000 --> 03:12:22.000]  and they don't even know who's doing the robbing.
[03:12:22.000 --> 03:12:24.000]  Our government should never go into debt.
[03:12:24.000 --> 03:12:26.000]  It doesn't need to go into debt.
[03:12:26.000 --> 03:12:28.000]  Our government can issue the money it needs.
[03:12:28.000 --> 03:12:31.000]  Nobody in the government, in either party,
[03:12:31.000 --> 03:12:33.000]  is looking at solving the debt problem.
[03:12:33.000 --> 03:12:37.000]  Then the answer is it's going to go into a depression
[03:12:37.000 --> 03:12:39.000]  as far as the eye can see.
[03:12:39.000 --> 03:12:41.000]  We can't get from where we are to where we need to be
[03:12:41.000 --> 03:12:43.000]  without a severe depression.
[03:12:43.000 --> 03:12:46.000]  The government's mentality in general seems to be
[03:12:46.000 --> 03:12:50.000]  we'll do what we have to do and we'll worry about paying for it later.
[03:12:50.000 --> 03:12:53.000]  But what you could do is pay for it now.
[03:12:53.000 --> 03:12:55.000]  In other words, you don't have to pay for it later.
[03:12:55.000 --> 03:12:57.000]  You don't have to pay for it with debt.
[03:12:57.000 --> 03:12:59.000]  You can just pay for it with money.
[03:12:59.000 --> 03:13:02.000]  Nobody's even talking about the debt problem as such.
[03:13:02.000 --> 03:13:04.000]  They're talking about the fact that, gee,
[03:13:04.000 --> 03:13:06.000]  the bankers aren't making enough money
[03:13:06.000 --> 03:13:08.000]  to live in the way that they're accustomed to.
[03:13:08.000 --> 03:13:12.000]  Remember, all this money we're giving them is at interest.
[03:13:12.000 --> 03:13:15.000]  Money we are borrowing to give to the banks.
[03:13:15.000 --> 03:13:18.000]  Then these very same banks have the audacity
[03:13:18.000 --> 03:13:22.000]  to loan this money back to us at more interest.
[03:13:22.000 --> 03:13:26.000]  In 2009, the interest we paid on the national debt in one year
[03:13:26.000 --> 03:13:30.000]  was more than we spent totally on the Iraq war.
[03:13:30.000 --> 03:13:33.000]  This system has got to go.
[03:13:33.000 --> 03:13:35.000]  Why haven't we heard this before?
[03:13:35.000 --> 03:13:38.000]  Because most of the media and Congress
[03:13:38.000 --> 03:13:41.000]  are beholding to the big banks for loans.
[03:13:41.000 --> 03:13:46.000]  Yes, Congress still appropriates money, but where do they get it?
[03:13:46.000 --> 03:13:50.000]  Again, what they can't raise from taxes, they borrow from banks.
[03:13:50.000 --> 03:13:55.000]  In 2009, Congress will spend over $4 trillion,
[03:13:55.000 --> 03:13:58.000]  but they will have to borrow half of it.
[03:13:58.000 --> 03:14:01.000]  The worst part is, we aren't just giving the money away.
[03:14:01.000 --> 03:14:04.000]  We're borrowing it to give it away.
[03:14:04.000 --> 03:14:08.000]  I think we need to reconsider and rethink, perhaps,
[03:14:08.000 --> 03:14:12.000]  the very foundations of our economic and monetary system.
[03:14:12.000 --> 03:14:14.000]  You want a new cause to embrace?
[03:14:14.000 --> 03:14:17.000]  You want to do something good for humanity?
[03:14:17.000 --> 03:14:21.000]  How about one simple reform that will fix most of the bad things in this world,
[03:14:21.000 --> 03:14:24.000]  like hunger, poverty, disease and misery?
[03:14:24.000 --> 03:14:27.000]  This is the ultimate civil rights struggle.
[03:14:27.000 --> 03:14:30.000]  Human kinds escape from serfdom.
[03:14:30.000 --> 03:14:35.000]  The solution is the secret that's been hidden from us for over 100 years.
[03:14:35.000 --> 03:14:38.000]  All right, folks, that's part of the trailer.
[03:14:38.000 --> 03:14:41.000]  It's up on infowars.com and presidentplanet.com.
[03:14:41.000 --> 03:14:45.000]  You can get the secret of ours or get the money master's with it if you'd like.
[03:14:45.000 --> 03:14:51.000]  Again, infowars.com or 888-253-3139.
[03:14:51.000 --> 03:14:57.000]  You can also write to us at PO Box 19549, Austin, Texas, 78760.
[03:14:57.000 --> 03:15:00.000]  And remember, just because you've known this for decades, doesn't mean others do.
[03:15:00.000 --> 03:15:05.000]  And now the world is falling to these bankers who are able to just take over the planet
[03:15:05.000 --> 03:15:07.000]  with all this fiat currency.
[03:15:07.000 --> 03:15:12.000]  This message is the stake that can be driven through their heart.
[03:15:12.000 --> 03:15:15.000]  It literally is the silver bullet that can kill the werewolves.
[03:15:15.000 --> 03:15:18.000]  It is the holy water that will burn Count Dracula's face off
[03:15:18.000 --> 03:15:23.000]  if you will get it and get it out to everyone you know and have viewings
[03:15:23.000 --> 03:15:28.000]  and give copies to members of Congress and get aggressive.
[03:15:28.000 --> 03:15:32.000]  The secret of ours by the amazing filmmaker Bill Still.
[03:15:32.000 --> 03:15:36.000]  And Bill, it is so great to see your work over the last 15 years.
[03:15:36.000 --> 03:15:38.000]  I was going from memory, but you corrected me.
[03:15:38.000 --> 03:15:41.000]  It was 1900 when this original novel came out.
[03:15:41.000 --> 03:15:45.000]  Go over the time period they were having then with the bankers,
[03:15:45.000 --> 03:15:48.000]  what the novel itself covers versus the film,
[03:15:48.000 --> 03:15:53.000]  and why your new documentary is so important.
[03:15:53.000 --> 03:15:56.000]  Oh, gosh. Well, there's a mouthful.
[03:15:56.000 --> 03:16:01.000]  Well, Frank Baum wrote the wonderful Wizard of Oz in 1900
[03:16:01.000 --> 03:16:07.000]  as a result of the failure of essentially the Greenbacker movement
[03:16:07.000 --> 03:16:12.000]  to capture the presidency when William Jennings Bryan
[03:16:12.000 --> 03:16:15.000]  ran for president in 1896.
[03:16:15.000 --> 03:16:18.000]  Baum saw that the movement was dying.
[03:16:18.000 --> 03:16:23.000]  He saw that the bankers and their gold money system was winning.
[03:16:23.000 --> 03:16:27.000]  And so he wrote the Wizard of Oz just as he was,
[03:16:27.000 --> 03:16:31.000]  as though he was firing a flare up into the night of history,
[03:16:31.000 --> 03:16:35.000]  hoping somebody somewhere down the line, generations later,
[03:16:35.000 --> 03:16:39.000]  would catch on to what was going on and pick up the banner.
[03:16:39.000 --> 03:16:41.000]  And that's what I've done.
[03:16:41.000 --> 03:16:47.000]  In fact, Alex, the inspiration for the Secret of Oz
[03:16:47.000 --> 03:16:50.000]  came from you the last time I was on your show.
[03:16:50.000 --> 03:16:53.000]  I had never heard this before.
[03:16:53.000 --> 03:16:55.000]  Wow. I didn't know that.
[03:16:55.000 --> 03:16:59.000]  And so you went and did the research and to correct one more thing,
[03:16:59.000 --> 03:17:04.000]  I support gold and silver because fiat currencies can be debased.
[03:17:04.000 --> 03:17:07.000]  And at the time, the bankers were using the hoarding of gold
[03:17:07.000 --> 03:17:09.000]  to manipulate the market.
[03:17:09.000 --> 03:17:11.000]  So it's not at all or nothing.
[03:17:11.000 --> 03:17:14.000]  You believe in a fiat system issued by Congress,
[03:17:14.000 --> 03:17:16.000]  which will be able to pay off the debt
[03:17:16.000 --> 03:17:18.000]  and truly empower the population.
[03:17:18.000 --> 03:17:21.000]  And I think your system is a great system
[03:17:21.000 --> 03:17:23.000]  because now the bankers have hoarded all the gold.
[03:17:23.000 --> 03:17:25.000]  And once they're done killing the fiat system,
[03:17:25.000 --> 03:17:27.000]  if we go back to a gold system,
[03:17:27.000 --> 03:17:30.000]  then they'll have the monopoly all over again.
[03:17:30.000 --> 03:17:36.000]  Well, it's funny. I saw Peter Schiff on TV just yesterday or the day before.
[03:17:36.000 --> 03:17:38.000]  And I love Peter Schiffer and Ron Paul.
[03:17:38.000 --> 03:17:42.000]  Let me say that right up front because we agree on 95% of the stuff.
[03:17:42.000 --> 03:17:46.000]  But, you know, I just think they're dead wrong on the whole gold thing.
[03:17:46.000 --> 03:17:52.000]  And Peter Schiff was asked, well, gee, if you believe that gold is the answer,
[03:17:52.000 --> 03:17:54.000]  well, then the United States is in great shape
[03:17:54.000 --> 03:17:57.000]  because the U.S. Treasury owns so much gold.
[03:17:57.000 --> 03:18:02.000]  And Peter kind of goes, well, yeah, but it hasn't been audited recently,
[03:18:02.000 --> 03:18:04.000]  and they all poo-pooed that.
[03:18:04.000 --> 03:18:06.000]  But that's absolutely correct.
[03:18:06.000 --> 03:18:12.000]  Fort Knox was unloaded in the late 1960s and early 1970s,
[03:18:12.000 --> 03:18:16.000]  even though the Treasury still keeps this massive amount,
[03:18:16.000 --> 03:18:20.000]  thousands of tons of gold on their books, but it's not there.
[03:18:20.000 --> 03:18:26.000]  So there's just a tremendous amount of disinformation on this whole thing.
[03:18:26.000 --> 03:18:30.000]  Well, let's go over the facts and how the monetary system works briefly
[03:18:30.000 --> 03:18:33.000]  and where the bankers have taken us, you know, at this point.
[03:18:33.000 --> 03:18:37.000]  And then let's get into the solutions that are in your film.
[03:18:37.000 --> 03:18:43.000]  But I think the allegory of the wonderful Wizard of Oz is the best place to start,
[03:18:43.000 --> 03:18:44.000]  as your film does.
[03:18:44.000 --> 03:18:47.000]  We're about to go to break, but let's start getting into that right now.
[03:18:47.000 --> 03:18:49.000]  The parallels in the book.
[03:18:49.000 --> 03:18:55.000]  Well, like it said in the trailer, the biggest piece of symbolism
[03:18:55.000 --> 03:18:59.000]  is the silver slippers on the Yellowbrick Road.
[03:18:59.000 --> 03:19:05.000]  Dorothy's slippers were only made to be ruby in 1939 when the film was made
[03:19:05.000 --> 03:19:09.000]  because that's when the technical process was new.
[03:19:09.000 --> 03:19:13.000]  And so they changed the silver slippers, which is what it was in the book,
[03:19:13.000 --> 03:19:16.000]  to ruby slippers for the movie.
[03:19:16.000 --> 03:19:21.000]  And thereby, most of the rest of the symbolism was lost in history.
[03:19:21.000 --> 03:19:24.000]  But if you go back to the book and you look at the illustrations,
[03:19:24.000 --> 03:19:28.000]  Dorothy's slippers were silver, and that was the symbolism.
[03:19:28.000 --> 03:19:35.000]  The silver slippers, which basically was a less controlled,
[03:19:35.000 --> 03:19:43.000]  more abundant form of money, allowed Dorothy to tread safely
[03:19:43.000 --> 03:19:48.000]  on the dangerous Yellowbrick Road, the gold money standard.
[03:19:48.000 --> 03:19:49.000]  All right, stay there.
[03:19:49.000 --> 03:19:53.000]  We're going to go to the Emerald City, the man behind the curtain, all of it,
[03:19:53.000 --> 03:19:54.000]  straight ahead.
[03:19:54.000 --> 03:19:55.000]  Stay with us, folks.
[03:19:55.000 --> 03:19:58.000]  This is key information, the secret of us.
[03:19:58.000 --> 03:19:59.000]  Straight ahead.
[03:20:01.000 --> 03:20:03.000]  Don't answer it.
[03:20:03.000 --> 03:20:05.000]  If fear strikes your heart when the phone rings,
[03:20:05.000 --> 03:20:07.000]  knowing it may be another bill collector,
[03:20:07.000 --> 03:20:10.000]  it's time for you to call zero debt in 90 days.
[03:20:10.000 --> 03:20:13.000]  800-477-9256.
[03:20:13.000 --> 03:20:16.000]  Settlements, bankruptcy, and attorneys are not the answer
[03:20:16.000 --> 03:20:19.000]  and may end up costing you up to 10 times more than necessary.
[03:20:19.000 --> 03:20:21.000]  Listen, if you're already in debt,
[03:20:21.000 --> 03:20:23.000]  does it make sense to get buried in another payment plan?
[03:20:23.000 --> 03:20:27.000]  Zero debt in 90 days gets you out of debt in 90 days guaranteed
[03:20:27.000 --> 03:20:31.000]  without a payment plan and without attorneys or going to court.
[03:20:31.000 --> 03:20:33.000]  Get the fastest relief from debt on the planet
[03:20:33.000 --> 03:20:36.000]  when you call 800-477-9256.
[03:20:36.000 --> 03:20:39.000]  If you have debt with the IRS, credit cards, student loans,
[03:20:39.000 --> 03:20:42.000]  or a foreclosure, we can help at zero debt in 90 days,
[03:20:42.000 --> 03:20:46.000]  and we are the only organization to provide written guarantees
[03:20:46.000 --> 03:20:47.000]  on the results.

[03:20:49.000 --> 03:20:52.000]  That's zerodebtguaranteed.com.

[03:20:56.000 --> 03:21:00.000]  That's 800-477-9256.
[03:21:00.000 --> 03:21:03.000]  The question is, where should the American people
[03:21:03.000 --> 03:21:05.000]  draw their line in the sand?
[03:21:05.000 --> 03:21:08.000]  What have we got? A republic or a monarchy?
[03:21:08.000 --> 03:21:12.000]  A republic is based on a constitution which protects minority rights.
[03:21:12.000 --> 03:21:14.000]  Not democracy, not mob rule,
[03:21:14.000 --> 03:21:16.000]  two wolves and a sheep voting on what's for dinner.
[03:21:16.000 --> 03:21:19.000]  So they think they own our land, they think they own our water,
[03:21:19.000 --> 03:21:22.000]  children, our education, our money.
[03:21:22.000 --> 03:21:26.000]  We have to define who we are and what we will tolerate.
[03:21:26.000 --> 03:21:30.000]  Somebody's going to ask you what you did during the Patriot Uprising.
[03:21:30.000 --> 03:21:31.000]  You have been warned.
[03:21:31.000 --> 03:21:33.000]  We have the facts. We have the constitution.
[03:21:33.000 --> 03:21:35.000]  We have the Bill of Rights. We have common law.
[03:21:35.000 --> 03:21:37.000]  Knowledge is power, ladies and gentlemen,
[03:21:37.000 --> 03:21:39.000]  and I'm so excited to be able to offer you,
[03:21:39.000 --> 03:21:41.000]  Don't Tread on Me, Rise of the Republic.
[03:21:41.000 --> 03:21:44.000]  Tyranny is upon us, but liberty and the sleeping giant
[03:21:44.000 --> 03:21:46.000]  that is the American people is rising.
[03:21:46.000 --> 03:21:49.000]  A new tool in the Info War. Don't Tread on Me.
[03:21:49.000 --> 03:21:53.000]  Order it at infowars.com or prisonplanet.com
[03:21:53.000 --> 03:21:57.000]  or call toll-free 888-253-3139
[03:21:57.000 --> 03:22:00.000]  and support independent patriotic liberty films.
[03:22:00.000 --> 03:22:03.000]  Making the right decisions is a challenge to investors.
[03:22:03.000 --> 03:22:05.000]  Are we going to see economic growth?
[03:22:05.000 --> 03:22:07.000]  Slide into a recession or at worst, depression.
[03:22:07.000 --> 03:22:09.000]  Hi, Ted Anderson from Midas Resources.
[03:22:09.000 --> 03:22:12.000]  We all know when a company acts irresponsibly,
[03:22:12.000 --> 03:22:15.000]  divesting ourselves in a move towards safety is prudent.
[03:22:15.000 --> 03:22:18.000]  When the market becomes volatile, U.S. Treasures are a safe haven.
[03:22:18.000 --> 03:22:21.000]  But what do you do when the U.S. government overextends itself
[03:22:21.000 --> 03:22:23.000]  and spends beyond its means?
[03:22:23.000 --> 03:22:25.000]  Many investors are turning toward gold
[03:22:25.000 --> 03:22:28.000]  as a common sense alternative to traditional paper investments.
[03:22:28.000 --> 03:22:31.000]  Midas Resources has put together a powerful book titled
[03:22:31.000 --> 03:22:35.000]  10 Reasons to Own Gold, discussing costs, benefits, risks,
[03:22:35.000 --> 03:22:38.000]  featuring full-color illustrations, weights, and measures.
[03:22:38.000 --> 03:22:43.000]  The book is free and can be yours by calling 800-686-2237.
[03:22:43.000 --> 03:22:46.000]  Paper investments are dwarfed by gold 6000-year history.
[03:22:46.000 --> 03:22:53.000]  Discover how gold may be right for you and your IRA by calling 800-686-2237.
[03:22:53.000 --> 03:22:56.000]  Whether buying or it's time for you to sell, the book is free.
[03:22:56.000 --> 03:23:21.000]  Call 800-686-2237.
[03:23:26.000 --> 03:23:28.000]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself,
[03:23:28.000 --> 03:23:31.000]  will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[03:23:31.000 --> 03:23:34.000]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[03:23:34.000 --> 03:23:38.000]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[03:23:38.000 --> 03:23:40.000]  How much will you need? We don't know.
[03:23:40.000 --> 03:23:43.000]  How much do you want? All you can get, I'm Alex Jones.
[03:23:43.000 --> 03:23:46.000]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.
[03:23:46.000 --> 03:23:54.000]  Call 1-800-409-5633 or check it out on the web at eFoodsDirect.com.
[03:23:54.000 --> 03:24:01.000]  Again, that number, 1-800-409-5633.
[03:24:01.000 --> 03:24:13.000]  If you go back to the founding of this country,
[03:24:13.000 --> 03:24:17.000]  they were fighting fractional reserve bankers and money manipulators.
[03:24:17.000 --> 03:24:20.000]  Go back to Christ time to fight the money changers.
[03:24:20.000 --> 03:24:25.000]  You go study ancient Chinese history. 3,000 years ago they were having revolts over this.
[03:24:25.000 --> 03:24:27.000]  The manipulation of money.
[03:24:27.000 --> 03:24:32.000]  If you look at Abraham Lincoln and before that, Andrew Jackson, it was all about the banks.
[03:24:32.000 --> 03:24:35.000]  The Wizard of Oz is about the banks and money.
[03:24:35.000 --> 03:24:41.000]  This is the issue because if you let private groups control your issuance of currency and credit,
[03:24:41.000 --> 03:24:43.000]  through different manipulations, you will be a slave.
[03:24:43.000 --> 03:24:44.000]  What did Thomas Jefferson say?
[03:24:44.000 --> 03:24:49.000]  If we ever let private banks and the corporations that grow up around them control the issuance of currency and credit,
[03:24:49.000 --> 03:24:55.000]  our children will grow up homeless on the continent.
[03:24:55.000 --> 03:24:56.000]  Their forefathers conquered.
[03:24:56.000 --> 03:24:58.000]  This is what we're talking about.
[03:24:58.000 --> 03:25:03.000]  And Bill Still, the maker of the new film, The Secret of Oz, he is such an excellent filmmaker.
[03:25:03.000 --> 03:25:05.000]  Such a great researcher.
[03:25:05.000 --> 03:25:06.000]  Continue.
[03:25:06.000 --> 03:25:10.000]  You've gotten up to the silver slippers on the Yellowbrook Road. Continue.
[03:25:10.000 --> 03:25:12.000]  Well, let me continue with what you were just saying.
[03:25:12.000 --> 03:25:19.000]  And yet all of these things throughout history have disappeared from history books.
[03:25:19.000 --> 03:25:22.000]  So you have to ask yourself why.
[03:25:22.000 --> 03:25:29.000]  And the reason is that the banks control so much through loans.
[03:25:29.000 --> 03:25:35.000]  And that's why I have a friend who was just laid off from a major television network.
[03:25:35.000 --> 03:25:45.000]  And he's so mad at Morgan Bank because it came down to whether this TV network was going to pay the interest on their loans,
[03:25:45.000 --> 03:25:50.000]  or they're going to lay off like the top 20 or 30 execs in this TV network.
[03:25:50.000 --> 03:25:52.000]  And so they laid off the execs.
[03:25:52.000 --> 03:25:55.000]  So, you know, that's how banks control the media.
[03:25:55.000 --> 03:25:58.000]  They don't necessarily have to own them.
[03:25:58.000 --> 03:26:05.000]  But as long as you're mortgaged out to the max, any business that's mortgaged out to the max can't go against the bankers.
[03:26:05.000 --> 03:26:09.000]  That's why you see essentially ruled by banker in this country.
[03:26:09.000 --> 03:26:14.000]  Well, that's happened for hundreds of years when farmers would start revolting and speaking out.
[03:26:14.000 --> 03:26:16.000]  The banks would just call their loans.
[03:26:16.000 --> 03:26:20.000]  Which is why it's so amazing that we have, and we'll talk about it later,
[03:26:20.000 --> 03:26:26.000]  this wonderful example of a correct banking system with the state bank of North Dakota.
[03:26:26.000 --> 03:26:30.000]  And, you know, another thing that you said, this is such an important issue.
[03:26:30.000 --> 03:26:34.000]  As I pointed out in the trailer, this is the ultimate civil rights struggle.
[03:26:34.000 --> 03:26:39.000]  This ability of bankers to loan government's money.
[03:26:39.000 --> 03:26:48.000]  The absolute total solution to this is government borrowing should absolutely be forbidden by every nation on the planet.
[03:26:48.000 --> 03:26:56.000]  Governments don't need to borrow like Lincoln and Kennedy said. They issue the currency. It's backed up by them.
[03:26:56.000 --> 03:26:58.000]  That's right. That's exactly right.
[03:26:58.000 --> 03:27:02.000]  And that's their most sovereign responsibility according to Abraham Lincoln.
[03:27:02.000 --> 03:27:05.000]  Not defending the nation, not doing this or that.
[03:27:05.000 --> 03:27:08.000]  It's to have control of the money system.
[03:27:08.000 --> 03:27:11.000]  That's the most important thing of a nation.
[03:27:11.000 --> 03:27:15.000]  And it's to the point where we've reached debt saturation.
[03:27:15.000 --> 03:27:21.000]  Let me interrupt. This is a short segment, long one coming up, and you can roll with all your great info.
[03:27:21.000 --> 03:27:29.000]  But Bill, even in a lot of our listeners probably go, you mean the government borrows money from bankers,
[03:27:29.000 --> 03:27:34.000]  but it says U.S. money. No, it doesn't. It says Federal Reserve note.
[03:27:34.000 --> 03:27:38.000]  Well, that's why you always see people saying, oh, the government's printing too much money.
[03:27:38.000 --> 03:27:43.000]  They're not printing it. They're borrowing it. That's twice as bad.
[03:27:43.000 --> 03:27:45.000]  Explain that in layman's terms.
[03:27:45.000 --> 03:27:52.000]  The government is not printing money. It's borrowing money by the issuance of U.S. bonds.
[03:27:52.000 --> 03:27:57.000]  Every single dollar in your pocket is created as a debt in this country.
[03:27:57.000 --> 03:28:00.000]  It's the debt money system. That's what they try to hide.
[03:28:00.000 --> 03:28:06.000]  That's why they try to have their politicians continually say, oh, we're going to pay down the national debt.
[03:28:06.000 --> 03:28:10.000]  Impossible. You cannot possibly pay down the national debt
[03:28:10.000 --> 03:28:14.000]  because to eliminate the national debt would be to eliminate your money.
[03:28:14.000 --> 03:28:19.000]  To eliminate a portion of the national debt would be to eliminate a portion of your money.
[03:28:19.000 --> 03:28:26.000]  We need to go to a non-debt money system where the government issues the money debt-free without the interest.
[03:28:26.000 --> 03:28:28.000]  It's the interest that's killing us.
[03:28:28.000 --> 03:28:30.000]  And that's what the Constitution says their job is.
[03:28:30.000 --> 03:28:33.000]  Congress shall control the issuance of currency and credit.
[03:28:33.000 --> 03:28:38.000]  But I watched Bernanke before Congress telling Ron Paul, you're not allowed to even know what we're doing
[03:28:38.000 --> 03:28:41.000]  because you're not supposed to be involved in it.
[03:28:41.000 --> 03:28:46.000]  I mean, this is completely 180 degrees the opposite of the truth.
[03:28:46.000 --> 03:28:51.000]  That's exactly right. And it boils down to a question of whether you want bankers in control
[03:28:51.000 --> 03:28:53.000]  or you want Congress in control.
[03:28:53.000 --> 03:28:57.000]  Despite the fact that Congress might be corrupt, et cetera, et cetera,
[03:28:57.000 --> 03:29:00.000]  government is all we've got.
[03:29:00.000 --> 03:29:06.000]  It's a blessing from God given us to try to control the banking establishment.
[03:29:06.000 --> 03:29:09.000]  That is the essential thing, the difference between other...
[03:29:09.000 --> 03:29:14.000]  Yeah, if we had a real government like Thomas Jefferson, Kennedy tried to block them, they killed him.
[03:29:14.000 --> 03:29:19.000]  I mean, look, look, you need honest, fair money as the agreed upon motive exchange
[03:29:19.000 --> 03:29:23.000]  and then goods and services and ideas are what have the value.
[03:29:23.000 --> 03:29:27.000]  Instead of this parasite economy waging war against the real economy,
[03:29:27.000 --> 03:29:31.000]  notice it's the big mega bankers that fund all the eugenicists and the fake environmentalists
[03:29:31.000 --> 03:29:34.000]  and it's the carbon tax they're going to use to destroy our society.
[03:29:34.000 --> 03:29:37.000]  They are at war against real wealth.
[03:29:37.000 --> 03:29:40.000]  It is a black hole that you mathematically cannot pay back.
[03:29:40.000 --> 03:29:42.000]  And that's what your film explains.
[03:29:42.000 --> 03:29:45.000]  These people, it's either us or them, ladies and gentlemen.
[03:29:45.000 --> 03:29:49.000]  Bill Stills, our guest, Secret of Oz, available on DVD at infowars.com.

[03:30:29.000 --> 03:30:31.000]  an old powerful shadow state.

[03:30:39.000 --> 03:30:42.000]  body scanners, sound cameras, citizen spies,
[03:30:42.000 --> 03:30:45.000]  staged terror and cameras on every street corner.
[03:30:45.000 --> 03:30:48.000]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[03:30:48.000 --> 03:30:50.000]  The police state isn't coming.
[03:30:50.000 --> 03:30:51.000]  It's here.

[03:32:01.000 --> 03:32:04.000]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[03:32:04.000 --> 03:32:07.000]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm,
[03:32:07.000 --> 03:32:09.000]  how much ammunition do you want?
[03:32:09.000 --> 03:32:11.000]  My answer would be all I can get.
[03:32:11.000 --> 03:32:14.000]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones,
[03:32:14.000 --> 03:32:16.000]  food is your only ammunition.
[03:32:16.000 --> 03:32:18.000]  How much do you want? When do you want it?
[03:32:18.000 --> 03:32:21.000]  Now or after the battle starts. When will you need it?
[03:32:21.000 --> 03:32:23.000]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[03:32:23.000 --> 03:32:26.000]  Will there be any food? Will it make your children sick?
[03:32:26.000 --> 03:32:29.000]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself,
[03:32:29.000 --> 03:32:31.000]  will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[03:32:31.000 --> 03:32:35.000]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[03:32:35.000 --> 03:32:39.000]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[03:32:39.000 --> 03:32:41.000]  How much will you need? We don't know.
[03:32:41.000 --> 03:32:43.000]  How much do you want? All you can get.
[03:32:43.000 --> 03:32:44.000]  I'm Alex Jones.
[03:32:44.000 --> 03:32:47.000]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.
[03:32:47.000 --> 03:32:51.000]  Call 1-800-409-5633.
[03:32:51.000 --> 03:32:54.000]  Or check it out on the web at eFoodsDirect.com.
[03:32:54.000 --> 03:33:14.000]  Again, that number, 1-800-409-5633.
[03:33:24.000 --> 03:33:37.000]  Oh, this is fitting music.
[03:33:37.000 --> 03:33:41.000]  On this 2010 July 4th, it's coming up.
[03:33:41.000 --> 03:33:44.000]  We're at the Crossroads, the total end of our republic.
[03:33:44.000 --> 03:33:50.000]  Absolute bondage to offshore money-changing corrupt banks.
[03:33:50.000 --> 03:33:56.000]  Being conquered fully and bankrupt as a tool of poverty and control.
[03:33:56.000 --> 03:33:59.000]  Or across roads to bring them down and bring them to justice.
[03:33:59.000 --> 03:34:03.000]  And the momentum is starting to turn against them.
[03:34:03.000 --> 03:34:10.000]  I mean, when do you think you'd see my articles being quoted in major Australian newspapers in the Drudge Report?
[03:34:10.000 --> 03:34:14.000]  Like Dollar Plunge after Ewan called a ditch greenback,
[03:34:14.000 --> 03:34:18.000]  replace it with a new global cashless SDR.
[03:34:18.000 --> 03:34:20.000]  Another level to the Ponzi scheme.
[03:34:20.000 --> 03:34:26.000]  The film is The Secret of Oz, available at infowars.com.
[03:34:26.000 --> 03:34:29.000]  You can get a big discount on The Money Masters, the precursor to this film,

[03:34:49.000 --> 03:34:53.000]  You notice I'm flogging this because anything that I see as a solution,
[03:34:53.000 --> 03:34:57.000]  like the film that I'm in that we're carrying, don't tread on me,
[03:34:57.000 --> 03:35:01.000]  rise the Republic, how to take the states back, the counties, the sheriffs,
[03:35:01.000 --> 03:35:05.000]  how to peacefully take our nation back from this corporate takeover, I'm promoting it.
[03:35:05.000 --> 03:35:12.000]  And that's also available at infowars.com, or by calling 888-253-3139.
[03:35:12.000 --> 03:35:19.000]  Or write to us at PO Box 19549, Austin, Texas, 787-60.
[03:35:19.000 --> 03:35:23.000]  But before we go back to Bill Still, I also want to tell you about a few of the sponsors
[03:35:23.000 --> 03:35:26.000]  that made today's radio broadcast possible.
[03:35:26.000 --> 03:35:30.000]  Of course, chief amongst those is frontsite.com.
[03:35:30.000 --> 03:35:33.000]  Have you heard of the millionaire patriot, Dr. Gnasius Piazza,
[03:35:33.000 --> 03:35:36.000]  and his top rated firearms training facility?
[03:35:36.000 --> 03:35:39.000]  Frontside Firearms Training, the website's frontside.com.
[03:35:39.000 --> 03:35:42.000]  He has a free handgun in five days of firearms training waiting for you.
[03:35:42.000 --> 03:35:46.000]  And if you act fast, you won't just get a five days of world-class gun training
[03:35:46.000 --> 03:35:49.000]  with no drill instructor or tough guy attitude.
[03:35:49.000 --> 03:35:51.000]  And the 30s stake and seal up its permit.
[03:35:51.000 --> 03:35:55.000]  All for pennies on the dollar, you'll get a free XD caliber pistol
[03:35:55.000 --> 03:35:57.000]  in the caliber of your choice.
[03:35:57.000 --> 03:36:01.000]  It's all at frontside.com, like the front of your rifle, frontside.com.
[03:36:01.000 --> 03:36:04.000]  Not enough to own guns, you've got to know how to use them, frontside.com.
[03:36:04.000 --> 03:36:08.000]  And then don't forget the wonderful folks finally at a cola blue,
[03:36:08.000 --> 03:36:10.000]  the atmospheric water generator.
[03:36:10.000 --> 03:36:13.000]  They've got a bunch of different units from seven and a half gallons a day.
[03:36:13.000 --> 03:36:16.000]  Looks like a water cooler without the water bottle on top, grabs water out of the air.
[03:36:16.000 --> 03:36:19.000]  That's what clouds are for those that are public school educated like myself
[03:36:19.000 --> 03:36:22.000]  and condenses it and then sends it through seven to twelve filters
[03:36:22.000 --> 03:36:24.000]  depending on which unit you buy.
[03:36:24.000 --> 03:36:28.000]  It's all available at a cola blue, E-C-O-L-O-B-L-U-E.com
[03:36:28.000 --> 03:36:33.000]  or 800-69-1-6043, a cola blue.com.
[03:36:33.000 --> 03:36:37.000]  Okay, going back to Bill Still, the maker of The Secret of Oz.
[03:36:37.000 --> 03:36:40.000]  If we just let these bankers...
[03:36:40.000 --> 03:36:43.000]  Bill, put it this way and then let's get back into the film.
[03:36:43.000 --> 03:36:46.000]  I've read and scanned over and had Ron Paul on yesterday,
[03:36:46.000 --> 03:36:51.000]  the Banker Reform Act that's passed the House and the Senate,
[03:36:51.000 --> 03:36:55.000]  but they have a different version, so they say it's going to pass in the next two weeks.
[03:36:55.000 --> 03:36:58.000]  It's in conference right now for those that just tuned in.
[03:36:58.000 --> 03:37:01.000]  And even the Washington Post admits, but said it was a good thing,
[03:37:01.000 --> 03:37:08.000]  the Federal Reserve will be given near complete power and autonomy to take over any financial institutions they want.
[03:37:08.000 --> 03:37:12.000]  There's smaller competition, state banks, local banks,
[03:37:12.000 --> 03:37:15.000]  and there is 600 trillion in derivatives, and this will fix it.
[03:37:15.000 --> 03:37:18.000]  I thought the TARP did a year and a half ago.
[03:37:18.000 --> 03:37:21.000]  And I mean, it's incredible.
[03:37:21.000 --> 03:37:24.000]  So the group that's engineered this, let's give them even more power.
[03:37:24.000 --> 03:37:27.000]  So it's not just, you know, we've got to beat them now.
[03:37:27.000 --> 03:37:33.000]  If we don't expose them now and give real solutions, they're going to use the crisis they created for even more power.
[03:37:33.000 --> 03:37:35.000]  Yeah, it's ruled by banks.
[03:37:35.000 --> 03:37:38.000]  I mean, this isn't going to fix the crisis.
[03:37:38.000 --> 03:37:44.000]  For example, June 25th Newsweek article by Michael Hirsch put it this way.
[03:37:44.000 --> 03:37:48.000]  The bill, quote, effectively anoints the existing banking elite.
[03:37:48.000 --> 03:37:54.000]  The bill makes it likely that they will be the future giants of banking as well for all time.
[03:37:54.000 --> 03:37:58.000]  For example, do you know who the biggest investor in BP is?
[03:37:58.000 --> 03:38:00.000]  Oh, yes, Goldman Sachs.
[03:38:00.000 --> 03:38:02.000]  Oh, JP Morgan.
[03:38:02.000 --> 03:38:06.000]  Oh, they were the biggest, but they dumped some of their stock right before I forgot.
[03:38:06.000 --> 03:38:10.000]  Well, you know, and everybody jump on Goldman Sachs.
[03:38:10.000 --> 03:38:13.000]  I mean, they get a lot of, they should get a lot of blame,
[03:38:13.000 --> 03:38:19.000]  but JP Morgan in the derivatives mess is like 50 times bigger than Goldman Sachs.
[03:38:19.000 --> 03:38:24.000]  Dwarfing Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan is the center of this whole black hole.
[03:38:24.000 --> 03:38:26.000]  And also I want to say something else.
[03:38:26.000 --> 03:38:31.000]  I just came back from a trip to Sweden, Germany and Iceland, and I do want to talk about Iceland.
[03:38:31.000 --> 03:38:37.000]  I know you had Betajita on a couple days ago, but you're big.
[03:38:37.000 --> 03:38:41.000]  And there are people in Sweden and Iceland right now listening to this program right now.
[03:38:41.000 --> 03:38:46.000]  Your name is well known over there.
[03:38:46.000 --> 03:38:49.000]  Well, worldwide people are waking up thanks to your work.
[03:38:49.000 --> 03:38:51.000]  You certainly helped educate me.
[03:38:51.000 --> 03:38:54.000]  How many years ago did the Money Masters come out?
[03:38:54.000 --> 03:38:57.000]  It was 14 to 15 years now.
[03:38:57.000 --> 03:38:59.000]  Yeah, I want to digress.
[03:38:59.000 --> 03:39:06.000]  I didn't know that it was this show that inspired you to go down the Yellowbrick Road with The Secret of Oz.
[03:39:06.000 --> 03:39:07.000]  What was said on the show?
[03:39:07.000 --> 03:39:10.000]  I mean, I've been aware of that forever, but I didn't...
[03:39:10.000 --> 03:39:14.000]  It just happened to mention that there was some type of symbolism related to The Wizard of Oz,
[03:39:14.000 --> 03:39:18.000]  and I'd never heard that before. I couldn't believe how somehow I had missed this.
[03:39:18.000 --> 03:39:28.000]  And so I jumped on the web and immediately saw that this had been the talk in economics academia for about 20 years.
[03:39:28.000 --> 03:39:33.000]  And so I said, oh yeah, this is the perfect vehicle because to me, The Money Masters...
[03:39:33.000 --> 03:39:38.000]  Well, I've always been looking for a way to re-film it because we did it so long ago.
[03:39:38.000 --> 03:39:40.000]  It was even before digital.
[03:39:40.000 --> 03:39:46.000]  I mean, it was filmed in high eight, for example, and it's just getting a little worn out looking, if you ask me.
[03:39:46.000 --> 03:39:52.000]  And also, it's too long, and I couldn't figure out how can we do this in a shorter format so it's a more effective political tool.
[03:39:52.000 --> 03:39:57.000]  And that's, I think, what we've done here. We filmed The Secret of Oz and HD.
[03:39:57.000 --> 03:40:03.000]  Well, I mean, The Money Masters is an authoritative classic, and it's deep in history and the whole system.
[03:40:03.000 --> 03:40:07.000]  I mean, I can't believe you're kind of knocking your masterpiece there.
[03:40:07.000 --> 03:40:10.000]  Well, I just, I think this is a more effective political tool.
[03:40:10.000 --> 03:40:15.000]  I mean, it takes somebody pretty dedicated to sit down for three hours and 23 minutes, you know.
[03:40:15.000 --> 03:40:20.000]  Now, this you can sit down and spend a hundred minutes and get the same story.
[03:40:20.000 --> 03:40:26.000]  Well, it does, I mean, it does look crisp, because it's shot in high def, but I mean, I just got to commend all of it because I know I'm instrumental.
[03:40:26.000 --> 03:40:31.000]  But I am the type of guy that will sit down and watch C-Span for three hours, so I guess I get your point.
[03:40:31.000 --> 03:40:38.000]  But you travel all over the world for this. Let's talk about some more of what the film covers.
[03:40:38.000 --> 03:40:43.000]  I want to say something first of all about, I want people to be hopeful here.
[03:40:43.000 --> 03:40:52.000]  And, you know, I think the good part that's going on right now is these guys always get way over arrogant with their power.
[03:40:52.000 --> 03:40:57.000]  I think Obama, the whole Obama thing, they've totally overplayed their hand.
[03:40:57.000 --> 03:41:05.000]  They're trying to bite off way too much. The American people is way hip to this whole thing, and they're going to crush them.
[03:41:05.000 --> 03:41:10.000]  The bad news is, although we might win, we might push out a lot of the bad guys.
[03:41:10.000 --> 03:41:12.000]  The beggars have wrecked the hell out of us.
[03:41:12.000 --> 03:41:16.000]  We might push a lot of them out of the next election.
[03:41:16.000 --> 03:41:24.000]  You know, that's still not going to fix it unless we fix the monetary system, unless we fix the debt problem.
[03:41:24.000 --> 03:41:29.000]  We're never going to fix this under the current scheme of things.
[03:41:29.000 --> 03:41:37.000]  We have to go at the debt money system and the ability of the banks to create 98% of our money.
[03:41:37.000 --> 03:41:42.000]  And you went to Iceland to show how the same groups are robbing them, same groups in Greece.
[03:41:42.000 --> 03:41:46.000]  Look at Greece. They're telling him, you've got to give up your pensions, everything.
[03:41:46.000 --> 03:41:50.000]  Germany, Spain, Portugal, and the people don't owe this money.
[03:41:50.000 --> 03:41:56.000]  And then on top of it, if you look at the case of Greece, 600-plus islands, their roads, their infrastructure,
[03:41:56.000 --> 03:42:02.000]  having to give it to the very private banks that set them up, they should be arresting.
[03:42:02.000 --> 03:42:06.000]  We'll never beat them in those two countries. There's only two countries where we have a shot.
[03:42:06.000 --> 03:42:10.000]  And that's the United States and Iceland. I've been in Iceland.
[03:42:10.000 --> 03:42:16.000]  The reason we have a shot there is because the people are mad. Iceland is the home of the Vikings.
[03:42:16.000 --> 03:42:20.000]  They're very proud of their country and they are mad right now.
[03:42:20.000 --> 03:42:27.000]  You know what I found out once I got in country that not only were their interest rates indexed to inflation,
[03:42:27.000 --> 03:42:31.000]  but their principle on their mortgages is indexed to inflation.
[03:42:31.000 --> 03:42:39.000]  And so after they killed the hell out of the Icelandic Krona, it doubled and tripled these people's house payments.
[03:42:39.000 --> 03:42:42.000]  They're getting foreclosed on, kicked out of their houses.
[03:42:42.000 --> 03:42:46.000]  The bankers wrote it just to rob everybody. Describe what you saw on the ground in Iceland.
[03:42:46.000 --> 03:42:55.000]  That's what I'm saying. So there's now a movement that has sprung up, which goes out and surrounds a person's house
[03:42:55.000 --> 03:42:58.000]  that's about to be foreclosed on and they've been very successful.
[03:42:58.000 --> 03:43:07.000]  They just, an absurdist party just took control of the capital city of Reykjavink called the Best Party.
[03:43:07.000 --> 03:43:14.000]  And we formed a monitor reform working group when we were over in Iceland or helped to form it.
[03:43:14.000 --> 03:43:21.000]  And we're presenting an idea called the Best Bank based on the Bank of North Dakota to them next week.
[03:43:21.000 --> 03:43:26.000]  We have an excellent chance. I spoke to three members of parliament when I was there.
[03:43:26.000 --> 03:43:34.000]  We have an excellent chance of bringing about a right money system in Iceland because these people are so mad and so fiercely independent.
[03:43:34.000 --> 03:43:41.000]  I urge you, Alex, and everybody in the sound of my voice to support Icelandic products at this point,
[03:43:41.000 --> 03:43:46.000]  just to help them to be sure that Americans are going to support them in this effort.
[03:43:46.000 --> 03:43:51.000]  And the way you can do that is you can go to the Nordic store, nordicstore.com.
[03:43:51.000 --> 03:43:57.000]  Whole Foods also carries a lot of Icelandic products.
[03:43:57.000 --> 03:44:00.000]  And, you know, buy Icelandic, buy Icelandic.
[03:44:00.000 --> 03:44:04.000]  Yeah, because they are literally the Alamo in the fight against the bankers.
[03:44:04.000 --> 03:44:09.000]  They are the front line and they are standing up against this evil when every other country is falling.
[03:44:09.000 --> 03:44:12.000]  Yeah, that's right. And they're one of the smallest economies.
[03:44:12.000 --> 03:44:16.000]  And so it's going to be a battle royale, but they're willing to fight it.
[03:44:16.000 --> 03:44:22.000]  And America has to support them. And the way we can really support them is to buy their products.
[03:44:22.000 --> 03:44:26.000]  Well, as you said, time is running out for the bankers.
[03:44:26.000 --> 03:44:31.000]  They have already ruined our economy so badly. Briefly describe,
[03:44:31.000 --> 03:44:36.000]  because I know you have this at the end of the Money Masters and the similar plan in this one,
[03:44:36.000 --> 03:44:41.000]  a very well-researched program to extricate ourselves from this fraudulent money system
[03:44:41.000 --> 03:44:45.000]  and get back on a constitutional system that built this nation.
[03:44:45.000 --> 03:44:50.000]  Until the bankers took over in 1913, we had almost zero inflation, sometimes deflation,
[03:44:50.000 --> 03:44:57.000]  with our currencies or our savings were strong, and on average a 10.1% yearly growth rate in the economy.
[03:44:57.000 --> 03:45:04.000]  We don't have that anymore. So we built our nation without the income tax that came the same year as the fellow reserve.
[03:45:04.000 --> 03:45:07.000]  That's part of the communist manifesto these bankers created.
[03:45:07.000 --> 03:45:11.000]  That's right, the bankers created communism to sucker everybody back into slavery.
[03:45:11.000 --> 03:45:15.000]  Communism has served them. Globalism is treason.
[03:45:15.000 --> 03:45:21.000]  I mean, let's go over your plan, the plan, to rectify things.
[03:45:21.000 --> 03:45:26.000]  Well, basically you have to eliminate the ability.
[03:45:26.000 --> 03:45:31.000]  Number one, job one is to eliminate the ability of governments to borrow.
[03:45:31.000 --> 03:45:35.000]  National debt should be absolutely illegal.
[03:45:35.000 --> 03:45:40.000]  And there's a couple of approaches that we can use to do that.
[03:45:40.000 --> 03:45:49.000]  You can create debt-free money, issue it from Congress, and issue it into the economy.
[03:45:49.000 --> 03:45:54.000]  As the new money comes in and we pay off the national debt with the new money,
[03:45:54.000 --> 03:45:57.000]  we gradually raise bank reserve requirements.
[03:45:57.000 --> 03:46:04.000]  So at the end we have no national debt and we have banks only able to loan out money they actually have.
[03:46:04.000 --> 03:46:09.000]  That way banks no longer can create money and only the government creates money.
[03:46:09.000 --> 03:46:15.000]  We don't want to eliminate commercial banks just as they've done with the Bank of North Dakota.
[03:46:15.000 --> 03:46:19.000]  The State Bank of North Dakota works in cooperation with the local banking community.
[03:46:19.000 --> 03:46:21.000]  The local banking community loves them.
[03:46:21.000 --> 03:46:28.000]  The State Bank of North Dakota kind of serves as a mini-federal reserve completely outside of the federal system.
[03:46:28.000 --> 03:46:37.000]  This model can be used in every state in the union and can go a long way towards eliminating every state deficit in this country.
[03:46:37.000 --> 03:46:45.000]  I urge everybody to go on the State Bank of North Dakota website and probably in every state in this nation right now,
[03:46:45.000 --> 03:46:53.000]  there are people in your state attempting to bring about in the state legislature the State Bank of North Dakota concept.
[03:46:53.000 --> 03:46:56.000]  Find them, if you can't find them, start your own group.
[03:46:56.000 --> 03:46:58.000]  That's the thing that we...
[03:46:58.000 --> 03:47:00.000]  But let's look at the other side of this.
[03:47:00.000 --> 03:47:06.000]  Because of industrialization, because of technology, we could all be living like literal kings.
[03:47:06.000 --> 03:47:11.000]  And when you read with Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan, the UN, Club of Rome, they all finance it.
[03:47:11.000 --> 03:47:15.000]  They say, we want carbon tax to shut down the industrialized society.
[03:47:15.000 --> 03:47:25.000]  They know that humanity tends to be wealthy now and then that makes us not dependent on them and the government, the banks control.
[03:47:25.000 --> 03:47:30.000]  And so they actively admit they've created a black hole monetary system that makes us poor.
[03:47:30.000 --> 03:47:38.000]  And they've made this type of austerity a beautiful thing, but not for them, for us.
[03:47:38.000 --> 03:47:43.000]  So they've doled up their neosurfdom and feudalism as something beautiful and good.
[03:47:43.000 --> 03:47:48.000]  So if we don't stop them, their goal is to make us debt slaves.
[03:47:48.000 --> 03:47:51.000]  I mean, these are premeditated wicked people.
[03:47:51.000 --> 03:47:54.000]  Can you speak to your research along that line?
[03:47:54.000 --> 03:48:03.000]  Their goal is to return us to a state of serfdom, and that is the key fight through all the history of humanity,
[03:48:03.000 --> 03:48:07.000]  is whether or not humanity will be able to escape serfdom.
[03:48:07.000 --> 03:48:14.000]  And that's why government is such a precious gift, because it is the only thing that stands between us and serfdom.
[03:48:14.000 --> 03:48:16.000]  They want to eliminate that.
[03:48:16.000 --> 03:48:23.000]  That's why they love to corrupt government and make government look bad, and that's why Congress has such low ratings.
[03:48:23.000 --> 03:48:29.000]  And they say privatize it, but that's another form of corporate governance.
[03:48:29.000 --> 03:48:36.000]  We only see enemies as nations like Russia or China, but really it's a corporate takeover.
[03:48:36.000 --> 03:48:37.000]  That's the treason.
[03:48:37.000 --> 03:48:46.000]  I am for small government, but I'm for our republic that then guards us because we are the government and guards our freedom.
[03:48:46.000 --> 03:48:51.000]  Centralization of power at every level is a bad thing.
[03:48:51.000 --> 03:48:57.000]  Decentralization of power at every level is almost always a great thing.
[03:48:57.000 --> 03:49:04.000]  And that's what the whole concept of state governments in the U.S. federal system, that the states remain sovereign,
[03:49:04.000 --> 03:49:09.000]  that the states have plenty of power, and of course that's what Obama is directly attacking.
[03:49:09.000 --> 03:49:11.000]  We have to decentralize power.
[03:49:11.000 --> 03:49:17.000]  We have to get the U.S. out of the U.N. for the most part, get it out of all these international banking agreements, etc., etc.
[03:49:17.000 --> 03:49:20.000]  Decentralization is a good thing.
[03:49:20.000 --> 03:49:25.000]  Well, you're absolutely right.
[03:49:25.000 --> 03:49:30.000]  And I think people are beginning to discover that because I've seen the banks push a kind of fake libertarianism.
[03:49:30.000 --> 03:49:33.000]  Although see governments bad, let us privatize it.
[03:49:33.000 --> 03:49:39.000]  But that's not privatization to take roads we built with our money and then give it to bankers to put toll roads on it.
[03:49:39.000 --> 03:49:41.000]  That's not free market.
[03:49:41.000 --> 03:49:47.000]  Well, you know, another thing we could do in the interim period, this Tobin tax is really a great thing.
[03:49:47.000 --> 03:49:50.000]  That hits at the heart of the high-frequency trading.
[03:49:50.000 --> 03:50:03.000]  If you just put a 1% tax on all of these high-frequency trades, you know, it could raise approximately between 5 and 7 trillion dollars for the U.S. economy.
[03:50:03.000 --> 03:50:07.000]  We only collect a little over a trillion in income tax.
[03:50:07.000 --> 03:50:10.000]  We could wipe out all of our taxation if we could.
[03:50:10.000 --> 03:50:12.000]  But again, the income tax goes to interest of the bankers.
[03:50:12.000 --> 03:50:16.000]  This is the tax rates just on the income tax in six months that go up.
[03:50:16.000 --> 03:50:18.000]  10% bracket goes up to 15.
[03:50:18.000 --> 03:50:20.000]  That's poor people, folks.
[03:50:20.000 --> 03:50:22.000]  25% bracket goes to 28.
[03:50:22.000 --> 03:50:23.000]  28 goes to 31.
[03:50:23.000 --> 03:50:24.000]  33 to 36.
[03:50:24.000 --> 03:50:27.000]  35 to 39.6, basically 40.
[03:50:27.000 --> 03:50:32.000]  And they've gotten rid of most of the exemptions and they're raising all these other taxes.
[03:50:32.000 --> 03:50:35.000]  I mean, and almost all of this is going to the bankers.
[03:50:35.000 --> 03:50:37.000]  Well, you know, you're absolutely right.
[03:50:37.000 --> 03:50:40.000]  And we stand at such a critical juncture right now.
[03:50:40.000 --> 03:50:44.000]  They're trying to seal their deal to make it impossible for us to escape.
[03:50:44.000 --> 03:50:46.000]  But they've way overplayed their hand.
[03:50:46.000 --> 03:50:49.000]  And now we've learned the secret of prosperity.
[03:50:49.000 --> 03:50:54.000]  And that is just eliminate their ability to collect interest from us on our very money.
[03:50:54.000 --> 03:50:57.000]  We don't have to rent our money into existence.
[03:50:57.000 --> 03:50:58.000]  Stay there. Stay there.
[03:50:58.000 --> 03:50:59.000]  Final segment straight ahead.
[03:50:59.000 --> 03:51:01.000]  The film is Secret of Oz.
[03:51:01.000 --> 03:51:04.000]  It's the number one reason for slow and clogged bathrooms.
[03:51:04.000 --> 03:51:05.000]  That's right.
[03:51:05.000 --> 03:51:06.000]  Hair.
[03:51:06.000 --> 03:51:09.000]  And the number one way to open drains plugged with hair?
[03:51:09.000 --> 03:51:11.000]  The drain clog.
[03:51:11.000 --> 03:51:13.000]  Stop standing in dirty bathwater.
[03:51:13.000 --> 03:51:15.000]  Stop using dangerous chemicals.
[03:51:15.000 --> 03:51:18.000]  Just push the drain claw past the pop-up in your sink or tub.
[03:51:18.000 --> 03:51:20.000]  Twist and pull.
[03:51:20.000 --> 03:51:23.000]  You'll be shocked at what this little tool can pull out of your drain.
[03:51:23.000 --> 03:51:27.000]  The drain claw has over 100 tiny hooks that claw through hair.
[03:51:27.000 --> 03:51:31.000]  Toothpaste and shampoo that slows and clogs your drains.
[03:51:31.000 --> 03:51:34.000]  See how it works right now at thedrainclaw.com.
[03:51:34.000 --> 03:51:42.000]  The drain claw is made in the USA and is the safest, easiest, most environmentally friendly solution to unclog bath drains.
[03:51:42.000 --> 03:51:46.000]  Get one for $6.99 or three for $15.
[03:51:46.000 --> 03:51:49.000]  The drain claw can be used over and over.
[03:51:49.000 --> 03:51:51.000]  Don't be fooled by substitutes.
[03:51:51.000 --> 03:51:52.000]  Buy the original.
[03:51:52.000 --> 03:51:53.000]  Buy the drain claw.

[03:51:56.000 --> 03:51:59.000]  That's the drain claw at thedrainclaw.com.
[03:52:01.000 --> 03:52:03.000]  They help to create a new world order.
[03:52:03.000 --> 03:52:05.000]  We are part of a new world order.
[03:52:05.000 --> 03:52:08.000]  A new world order based upon collective action.
[03:52:08.000 --> 03:52:13.000]  Invisible Empire is a damning indictment of the globalists through their own words and documents.
[03:52:13.000 --> 03:52:18.000]  The new world order really is a tool for addressing a new world of possibilities.
[03:52:18.000 --> 03:52:20.000]  It means all the world under their control.
[03:52:20.000 --> 03:52:23.000]  The United Nations would take over America.
[03:52:23.000 --> 03:52:26.000]  The Tri-Lateral Commission would control the world.
[03:52:26.000 --> 03:52:34.000]  Invisible Empire chronicles how men of power and influence have worked in stealth for centuries to establish an oppressive world government.
[03:52:34.000 --> 03:52:39.000]  I believe, first of all, that we now need nothing short of a world constitution for the global financial system.
[03:52:39.000 --> 03:52:42.000]  Global governance with the establishment of the G20.
[03:52:42.000 --> 03:52:46.000]  So it's going to be an inner ruling elite and then everyone else.
[03:52:46.000 --> 03:52:48.000]  And I got news for you. You're everyone else.
[03:52:48.000 --> 03:52:50.000]  Invisible Empire.

[03:53:12.000 --> 03:53:18.000]  Settlements, bankruptcy, and attorneys are not the answer and may end up costing you up to 10 times more than necessary.
[03:53:18.000 --> 03:53:22.000]  Listen, if you're already in debt, does it make sense to get buried in another payment plan?
[03:53:22.000 --> 03:53:30.000]  Zero debt in 90 days gets you out of debt in 90 days, guaranteed, without a payment plan and without attorneys or going to court.

[03:54:25.000 --> 03:54:32.000]  This article, popular music is the Babylon System, another mainstream London Guardian article that Watson wrote about it,
[03:54:32.000 --> 03:54:39.000]  where they admit that world government and Illuminati is being promoted all over the media by Lady Gaga, everything.
[03:54:39.000 --> 03:54:45.000]  That's all at GCNLive.com and of course backed up at Infowars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[03:54:45.000 --> 03:54:52.000]  I'll be back Sunday 4-6pm and of course on Monday, but this 4th of July, you know, I meant to get into the Declaration of Independence
[03:54:52.000 --> 03:54:57.000]  into it Sunday, but everybody should read this because this is what the 4th of July is all about.
[03:54:57.000 --> 03:55:02.000]  And they understood the type of tyranny they were facing and quite frankly, it's nothing compared to what we're facing.
[03:55:02.000 --> 03:55:05.000]  This is more scientific, dehumanizing.
[03:55:05.000 --> 03:55:10.000]  The globalists admit they're transhumanists who want us to be feudal slaves.
[03:55:10.000 --> 03:55:13.000]  They admit they're not going to give us any quarter.
[03:55:13.000 --> 03:55:15.000]  They admit they want to bankrupt us.
[03:55:15.000 --> 03:55:18.000]  I mean, they constantly brag about it.
[03:55:18.000 --> 03:55:23.000]  If we just put out the alternative to their tyranny, they will fall.
[03:55:23.000 --> 03:55:27.000]  And that's why Bill Still's new film, The Secret of Oz, is so important.
[03:55:27.000 --> 03:55:29.000]  Again, it's available at Infowars.com.
[03:55:29.000 --> 03:55:31.000]  We've got four minutes left, sir, going out.
[03:55:31.000 --> 03:55:34.000]  You've got the floor closing comments about your new amazing film.
[03:55:34.000 --> 03:55:41.000]  All right, well, I would just boil this down to three quick sound bites as far as what to do, what to take it from here.
[03:55:41.000 --> 03:55:49.000]  On the international level, support Iceland. Iceland is our best shot to get a toehold for a correct money system in the world system.
[03:55:49.000 --> 03:55:52.000]  Once we get it in Iceland, then I was in Sweden.
[03:55:52.000 --> 03:55:56.000]  I could have pointed to Iceland from Sweden, and Sweden would have paid more attention.
[03:55:56.000 --> 03:56:07.000]  The way you do that is you go to icelandnaturally.com, Nordicstore.com, or Whole Foods sells a lot of Icelandic stuff.
[03:56:07.000 --> 03:56:13.000]  On the state level, support the state bank concept based on the Bank of North Dakota.
[03:56:13.000 --> 03:56:16.000]  It's a way for states to regain sovereignty.
[03:56:16.000 --> 03:56:22.000]  You're going to see next year's legislative session, at least six, if not 10 or 12 states.
[03:56:22.000 --> 03:56:25.000]  The state bank issue will come up.
[03:56:25.000 --> 03:56:31.000]  What that means is that states no longer have to borrow them and no longer have to float bond issues.
[03:56:31.000 --> 03:56:37.000]  It's totally saved all the interest payments, and their money is put more in their control.
[03:56:37.000 --> 03:56:41.000]  On the national level, it all boils down to just one phrase.
[03:56:41.000 --> 03:56:48.000]  One phrase fixes everything on the national level, and that's no more national debt.
[03:56:48.000 --> 03:56:57.000]  If you eliminated the ability of the government to borrow, they would have to face the political consequences of spending immediately because they'd have to raise taxes.
[03:56:57.000 --> 03:57:07.000]  That would solve everything else. We'd have to eliminate the entire national debt, and that's my solution in three quick steps.
[03:57:07.000 --> 03:57:11.000]  I'll say it again. It's us through them. There's no more time to screw around.
[03:57:11.000 --> 03:57:17.000]  The world government's out in the open. They're telling you the solution is the same banks that ripped you off will now have a world government.
[03:57:17.000 --> 03:57:22.000]  You'll pay carbon taxes to them, and the dollar will be under its controlled, unelected bankers.
[03:57:22.000 --> 03:57:32.000]  They've already got our banking system here. Now they want to bring it openly to the offshore corporations, and it's the magnitude of this.
[03:57:32.000 --> 03:57:38.000]  I know a lot of people didn't want to believe it. The media would demonize you a decade ago if you talked about the Federal Reserve being private,
[03:57:38.000 --> 03:57:45.000]  and as Ron Paul and others have said, the globalists are now very upset because even though they were able to kill his audit, the Fed bill,
[03:57:45.000 --> 03:57:55.000]  it got massive cosponsorship, and people are now at universities and everywhere talking about the corporate illegitimate takeover of America.
[03:57:55.000 --> 03:58:04.000]  And now the elite is being recognized as the enemy. The puppet presidents people are realizing are just that puppets.
[03:58:04.000 --> 03:58:06.000]  Go ahead.
[03:58:06.000 --> 03:58:13.000]  If I could say one more thing, and that's eliminating the Fed will not fix the problem. National debt is the solution.
[03:58:13.000 --> 03:58:20.000]  No, no, I agree with you. But, I mean, we've got to certainly get rid of the feds so we can turn the monetary control back over to Congress.
[03:58:20.000 --> 03:58:25.000]  We'll have you back on Bill still soon to talk more about the film and play some clips of it.
[03:58:25.000 --> 03:58:31.000]  Secret of Oz, available at infowars.com. Great talk of day. Have a great 4th of July, Bill.
[03:58:31.000 --> 03:58:36.000]  Great job to the crew. Great job to the listeners, the affiliates, the sponsors, all of you.
[03:58:36.000 --> 03:58:44.000]  Retransmission starts now on the audio streams at infowars.com back Sunday, 4 p.m. Central.
