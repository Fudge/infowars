[00:30.000 --> 00:37.400]  great topics, free speech at its best. This is We the People Radio Network.
[00:37.400 --> 00:45.920]  Government cover-ups. You want answers? Well, so does he. He's Alex Jones on the
[00:45.920 --> 00:53.880]  GCN Radio Network and now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:53.880 --> 01:07.160]  Well, we have a huge broadcast lined up for you today. Ray McGovern, top CIA analyst,
[01:07.160 --> 01:13.080]  morning briefer, Ronald Reagan, George Bush senior, battling lymphoma cancer, by the way.
[01:13.080 --> 01:17.880]  He's going to be joining us. He said a few months ago on the show, a few weeks ago again on the
[01:17.880 --> 01:24.360]  show, that the Bush administration is planning to attack Iran in the next six to eight months.
[01:25.880 --> 01:30.920]  And since he said that here, we have this headline out of Reuters and other publications,
[01:30.920 --> 01:36.360]  Bolton. Israel will attack Iran before next president is sworn in.
[01:39.000 --> 01:45.320]  Mossad's Dagan, an omen of war from press TV. The Mossad chief is staying on an unprecedented
[01:45.320 --> 01:51.640]  another year, another sign of war. Israeli papers say Reuters also reporting aid is saying that
[01:51.640 --> 01:57.000]  there's a plot to kill Ahmed Denizide, thwarted at UN meeting and that the U.S. also tried.
[01:57.000 --> 02:01.960]  That is the private corporate interest that control the U.S. tried to kill him on his visit to Baghdad.
[02:03.320 --> 02:07.000]  Israel is exercising for nuclear disaster with Iran.
[02:07.640 --> 02:10.280]  Online Journal is reporting that as well as the New York Times.
[02:10.280 --> 02:19.640]  That is just some of the news on that front. He will be joining us coming up in about 20 minutes.
[02:22.040 --> 02:27.320]  By the way, my producer thought, why not try to get the directors of harp on?
[02:29.000 --> 02:33.240]  And so he called him up and he set up some of the different directors of separate
[02:33.240 --> 02:43.320]  harp programs to actually get their PR response to what harp that big antenna array is doing up
[02:43.320 --> 02:48.520]  in Alaska because Dr. Nick Baggage and many others have written books on the subject and
[02:48.520 --> 02:53.160]  gone back to some of the declassified documents from the 60s. Some of the nefarious things,
[02:53.160 --> 03:04.360]  but we'll talk to them and get their perspective coming up in the second hour today.
[03:05.080 --> 03:09.480]  A lot of the guests I think of, but sometimes Trey thinks a really great guest to get on and
[03:10.040 --> 03:12.760]  that's certainly one of them. He told me last week we're probably having some of the harp
[03:12.760 --> 03:18.360]  directors on, including the director of harp. And then voila, we'll see if they're here in one hour.
[03:18.360 --> 03:25.960]  Also, there's lots of disinfo pieces like this one out of ABC news. Something's fishy.
[03:25.960 --> 03:34.520]  Experts say price of gas should be $2 a gallon, not $4. Then they bumble around in this AP article
[03:34.520 --> 03:41.320]  that was posted on ABC news and basically just put out a bunch of disinfo to the mindless dumb
[03:41.320 --> 03:47.640]  down public. Americans are furious about the high price of gas. If you get too furious,
[03:47.640 --> 03:52.280]  if you noticed all the cops in black uniforms shoving you around, checkpoints, the cameras,
[03:53.000 --> 03:59.000]  go ahead, get furious slaves. Americans are furious about the high price of gas and this
[03:59.000 --> 04:03.880]  isn't going to make you feel any better. A number of oil industry experts told a congressional panel
[04:03.880 --> 04:08.200]  money that oil speculators are to blame for gasoline prices reaching dizzying records.
[04:09.000 --> 04:16.120]  Then you have 15, 20% of it is speculation driven by dollar devaluation, but the majority of it is
[04:16.120 --> 04:23.080]  just dollar devaluation on its face. Absolute fact, everyone in the world knows, but the decadent
[04:23.080 --> 04:28.280]  know it all slave population that's having eugenics operations carried out against it.
[04:28.920 --> 04:33.880]  Just running around mindlessly, arrogantly. I mean, they know the government's lying to them,
[04:33.880 --> 04:39.320]  but they don't have any idea just how bad and just how corrupt and bankrupt and evil the system is.
[04:39.320 --> 04:46.440]  And so they'll be fed by the disinfo thing. Oh, it's some shadowy speculators. They did it.
[04:47.720 --> 04:54.840]  Yeah. Yeah. That's why they pay 14 cents a gallon in Venezuela and 44 cents a gallon in Mexico.
[04:54.840 --> 05:01.080]  And that's why they pay 23, 24 cents a gallon in Brazil. And yeah, yeah.
[05:03.400 --> 05:07.560]  That's why Americans pay on average five times what others pay for prescription drugs.
[05:07.560 --> 05:14.200]  It's because we're schmucks. We're idiots. We're morons. We've been under hardcore global brainwashing
[05:14.200 --> 05:20.440]  for 100 years. That's why because the average school kid doesn't know where the sun goes when it sets.
[05:21.880 --> 05:28.360]  Doesn't know what a continent is. Doesn't know anything. Just know how to be slaves and how to
[05:28.360 --> 05:36.120]  be exterminated. Our beloved. The only things I am Dr. Buell von Scheich with the white paper
[05:36.120 --> 05:41.800]  comicals. Mr. Steve Schenck with this fearless radio program is correct when he says the solution
[05:41.800 --> 05:47.560]  to our difficult times is to store food and get healthy. My comrades and I are the media don't
[05:47.560 --> 05:53.480]  want you to panic. We unlike fearless radio try not to tell you about the food control legislation.
[05:53.480 --> 05:59.320]  Hurricane Katrina the American famine families unable to buy food. If we told you that solution
[05:59.320 --> 06:04.440]  to all these problems is food you'd panic and run out and buy a food before it disappeared
[06:04.440 --> 06:10.280]  or you couldn't afford it. You'd completely mess up the perfect strategy for population control
[06:10.280 --> 06:16.600]  and they kick us out of the survivors club. You are a sissy chicken if you call jmsefoodsdirect.com
[06:16.600 --> 06:27.000]  and order food. This is Steve. Call 800 409 5633 on the web efoodsdirect.com 800 409 5633.

[08:38.280 --> 08:53.960]  your mind you know i'm still looking and watching and normally the supreme court ruled several months
[08:53.960 --> 09:01.640]  ago on and they admit they secretly ruled on the second amendment and they always released it during
[09:01.640 --> 09:08.120]  the summer they had their meeting to quote release the cases some of them were released but i i can't
[09:08.120 --> 09:13.960]  find their ruling on the second amendment of course we don't need them to rule on it we have
[09:13.960 --> 09:18.040]  passed ruling saying it's an absolute individual right against tyranny and government and criminals
[09:18.040 --> 09:23.320]  on the street everybody knows that of course everybody knew you didn't kill babies in the
[09:23.320 --> 09:26.360]  womb but the supreme court said it was a good thing and they're responsible for the murder of
[09:26.360 --> 09:33.160]  50 million children but uh it's a lot of they turn mass murder into a privilege and a right
[09:35.640 --> 09:39.800]  so i'm watching and looking to see what happens there we have larry pratt head of governors
[09:39.800 --> 09:44.920]  of america and erin zellman had a jews preservation of firearms ownership joining us in the fourth
[09:44.920 --> 09:50.120]  hour today and we should know what's happening by then it's very suspicious they haven't released it yet
[09:50.120 --> 09:58.280]  and very ominous this is if they don't want it to be noticed you watch it'll be hailed as a pro gun
[09:58.280 --> 10:06.440]  ruling and it won't be ray mcgovern joins us in 15 minutes jim bates harp program air force research

[10:18.600 --> 10:25.720]  we've got all three of these guys on a conference call uh i guess from the space command director
[10:25.720 --> 10:31.800]  if it was a smaller part of uh coming on the next hour we'll see if they show up uh then we've got

[10:39.480 --> 10:45.720]  i've got all this news about oil prices exploding i've got all this news about commodities exploding
[10:45.720 --> 10:52.120]  the dollar continuing to fall as the blind public spiritually blind psychologically blind
[10:52.120 --> 10:56.840]  intellectually blind just stumble around like zombies drooling bumping into each other it's
[10:56.840 --> 11:03.320]  very painful watch my fellow man windered intellectually defenseless just giggling and
[11:03.320 --> 11:09.080]  smirking and stumbling around uh it's so simple everything that's happening and you just can't
[11:09.080 --> 11:17.080]  even if you can wake them up you can wake them up to the fact they're under attack but then
[11:17.080 --> 11:21.000]  they have no respect for themselves and don't think they can mobilize against the tyranny
[11:21.000 --> 11:25.160]  you've got all these evil people working for government all these other people that rationalized
[11:25.160 --> 11:29.000]  the corruption they do and the things they carry out for the global corporate slave system
[11:30.840 --> 11:35.560]  i mean this morning i'm pretty freaked out i was reading a newly declassified leaked
[11:35.560 --> 11:45.640]  similar to other declassified army field manuals in co until pro indus info uh in torture death
[11:45.640 --> 11:51.560]  squads and you can just see them doing it all here in the u.s how they incrementally ratchet
[11:51.560 --> 11:55.640]  up the police state till the public's under total martial law and how they're deploying
[11:55.640 --> 12:01.640]  this inside the u.s i was reading that with har for about 30 minutes this morning i could spend
[12:01.640 --> 12:13.400]  the next four hours on that alone oh god and then i was um watching news videos as as the
[12:13.400 --> 12:18.680]  local news said it was good as they busted in houses at gunpoint as they arrested people
[12:18.680 --> 12:23.320]  as they took people out of their homes uh up in the midwest where they've had some flooding
[12:24.120 --> 12:28.120]  as they would just pull people over and run up and point guns to their heads screaming at them
[12:28.120 --> 12:34.280]  um just just lawless government letting you know you're a slave in your face this is martial law
[12:43.080 --> 12:44.200]  there is just so much
[12:47.000 --> 12:51.080]  going on and then i ran across
[12:51.080 --> 12:57.320]  this this news here in my stack
[13:00.040 --> 13:00.840]  dealing with
[13:07.800 --> 13:11.880]  attacks on the first amendment in this country in free speech in england
[13:11.880 --> 13:19.880]  and i have experienced in new york city in chicago in austin texas
[13:22.520 --> 13:23.800]  in washington dc
[13:29.240 --> 13:32.760]  did i mention in london what is in these stories
[13:32.760 --> 13:41.320]  headline the register the war on photographers you're all al-qaeda suspects now
[13:42.280 --> 13:47.160]  it's not an alex jones headline a prison-planet headline which have always been accurate so
[13:47.160 --> 13:52.360]  it would seem shocking to some but that's really what they say now uh another one out of the mail
[13:52.360 --> 14:08.520]  online where you have this gay man who writes for the paper and he's out of an anti-war protest
[14:08.520 --> 14:17.800]  covering it when bush came to town in england a few weeks ago last week and he sees one of his
[14:17.800 --> 14:26.280]  buddies one of his liaisons and shoving people trying to attack the police the guy's got a big
[14:26.280 --> 14:31.080]  camera taking photos while the protesters while he's provocaturing then the police go ahead and
[14:31.080 --> 14:39.880]  attack the crowd and the article kind of halfway defends in a sick way that this guy is out there
[14:39.880 --> 14:48.600]  provocaturing and talks about how handsome he is how handsome the police captain in plain clothes is
[14:49.160 --> 14:53.160]  provocaturing see i mean it's just an acceptance of open evil
[14:58.280 --> 15:01.480]  and he walks up and he goes oh we're we're friends you're a police officer
[15:01.480 --> 15:11.160]  and then it just goes into all this sickening double think about well i i guess provocaturing
[15:11.160 --> 15:16.840]  you know it's what they need to do i i mean you know how criminal the government is how
[15:16.840 --> 15:23.960]  criminal these police are when you've got thousands of people at peacefully out there trying to protest
[15:23.960 --> 15:28.520]  bush and they've banned it in most areas of the city and they're trying to get up to the barricades
[15:28.520 --> 15:36.120]  miles away from bush and there's plain close cops running around starting fights shoving
[15:36.120 --> 15:41.080]  protesters trying to get the protesters to attack the police and the cops all know what
[15:41.080 --> 15:46.440]  they're doing they want to attack freedom they want to suppress the people they are guilty of
[15:47.160 --> 15:51.240]  tyranny they are tyrants they are criminals they are the worst type of crooks
[15:51.240 --> 15:59.720]  and then i read this article out of the register where mainline video people mainline photographers
[15:59.720 --> 16:04.840]  news people can just be out getting a shot for the news of street traffic and the cops come over
[16:04.840 --> 16:09.400]  and seize their tapes and there's no judge no jury no arrest they just hand them a terrorist form
[16:09.400 --> 16:14.040]  this happened to me in fact cops walk up so you can't videotape in london and i go but i'm videotaping
[16:14.760 --> 16:19.240]  people coming out of the subway entrance for for well do you have a permit for that i go
[16:19.240 --> 16:24.920]  there aren't permits for video and he goes well that's right but turn your camera off or i'll arrest
[16:24.920 --> 16:32.120]  you and then i'm putting you in a database and he took my id put me in a database and i'm now
[16:32.120 --> 16:37.880]  listed as a potential terrorist millions of americans are listed eight million britains are listed
[16:39.000 --> 16:43.560]  and you you try to talk to somebody on the street now and he weren't england the police walk over
[16:43.560 --> 16:48.360]  and say okay what are you talking about i need a follow report on i mean that is classic secret
[16:48.360 --> 16:58.520]  police that is downtown red square moscow that is beijing outside the forbidden city with the big
[16:58.520 --> 17:05.240]  portraits of moussey tongue in fact it's worse now in england and many cities in the u.s than it is
[17:05.240 --> 17:13.880]  in communist china today and folks it isn't just alex jones i watched in dc on two different trips

[22:33.720 --> 22:38.440]  federal reserve note and understand the risks of deficit spending therefore with catastrophic
[22:38.440 --> 22:42.680]  events it comes as no surprise that some banks have currently placed limits on the amount of
[22:42.680 --> 22:47.480]  cash depositors can remove from their accounts a fractional reserve system means only a small
[22:47.480 --> 22:52.040]  portion of your deposit is held in reserve for immediate withdrawal deficit spending will skyrocket

[22:57.160 --> 23:02.440]  economy a current effort is underway by the fed along with other central banks to increase liquidity
[23:02.440 --> 23:07.240]  for depositors however an increase in money supply without equal expansion and productivity
[23:07.240 --> 23:12.600]  can cause inflation in order to achieve strength and stability i recommend a conservative portion

[24:49.720 --> 24:59.320]  even if they're not intellectually studying geopolitical landscape i focus on the pain
[24:59.320 --> 25:03.640]  rama govern is our guest we really are honored to have him for the next 35 minutes or so
[25:06.520 --> 25:10.680]  he uh came on a few weeks ago and said that they really are gearing up to attack iran he
[25:10.680 --> 25:18.040]  doesn't know they're gonna do it but they intend to and uh now we have bolton saying publicly uh
[25:18.040 --> 25:27.160]  to the press to the uk's telegraph uh that uh that there is a plan to have to have israel
[25:27.160 --> 25:33.000]  attack iran before the next president is sworn in meanwhile we have the corporate uh media
[25:34.760 --> 25:40.120]  finally reporting on the fact that the neocons including mccain's advisor saying terror attacks
[25:40.120 --> 25:44.760]  would really help them and be a great thing so we'll uh talk about that as well with
[25:44.760 --> 25:51.640]  our guest ray mcgovern mr mcgovern can you break down the latest developments uh on the iran front
[25:53.160 --> 25:59.640]  well yes alex it's very troubling indeed we have a whole series of indicators uh much like the ones
[25:59.640 --> 26:07.160]  before the attack on iraq uh where it looks like the people running our our policy uh let me just
[26:07.160 --> 26:17.800]  get that off here sorry our policy there toward uh um toward iran this time are the same follows
[26:17.800 --> 26:24.200]  that brought us iraq and uh they seem to be held on doing what they seem to have promised
[26:24.200 --> 26:30.040]  israelis they would do uh before they uh before they left office and that leaves only six six
[26:30.040 --> 26:37.160]  months and so we see olmer's and and bush huddling several times and olmer just seemed seeming delighted
[26:37.160 --> 26:42.600]  that they're what bush and he have worked out uh mentioning operational details which are being
[26:42.600 --> 26:49.320]  now worked out by pilots and planners and so forth so it looks very real uh the extraordinary thing
[26:49.320 --> 26:59.000]  here alex is that uh it would become so inward would be become so so uh accustomed to talking
[26:59.000 --> 27:05.960]  about well when will we start the next war uh the american people don't seem to realize the
[27:05.960 --> 27:11.880]  gravity of the situation here not only in terms of you know starting a war here and there will
[27:11.880 --> 27:19.560]  he nearly but in this case starting a war against a formidable opponent uh in which we cannot win
[27:19.560 --> 27:26.280]  i mean we just cannot win this one and if we start bombing iran the the uh consequences will be
[27:26.280 --> 27:31.320]  well they'd be catastrophic what is it in the psychology ray mcgovernment you advise many presidents
[27:31.320 --> 27:35.160]  who were the morning braver for george busch senior or highly respected analyst and all the
[27:35.160 --> 27:39.240]  other analysts are saying the same thing you're saying i mean what is it about napoleon having
[27:39.240 --> 27:45.000]  to attack russia or hitler why do they always just have to push it push it push it well partly
[27:45.000 --> 27:51.960]  because they gather around themselves a group of little sycophants a group of you know courtiers
[27:51.960 --> 28:01.000]  who uh who just uh kind of say yes mr president yes mr emperor or whatever and uh they don't
[28:01.000 --> 28:07.560]  question they just kind of fall into lock step and uh you know all you have to do is is review
[28:07.560 --> 28:13.240]  what has happened to the uh to the institutions in this country to include the senior military
[28:13.240 --> 28:20.520]  under rumsfeld you'll see a thoroughly corrupted regime that sat around and helped rumsfeld lie
[28:20.520 --> 28:26.760]  about torture and the and you know the destruction of of the army in which i was proud to serve so
[28:26.760 --> 28:32.200]  you have a situation where not many people are standing up and uh and when you get somebody like
[28:32.200 --> 28:39.000]  to guba general to guba who did the only the only honest investigation of opal grabe being marginalized
[28:39.000 --> 28:45.560]  and ridiculed and that kind of thing then you've got a situation where uh uh you know it's very very
[28:45.560 --> 28:51.480]  doubtful that this attack can be prevented and as you probably know he came out last week
[28:51.480 --> 28:56.760]  with the prestigious international group uh a medical association and said war crimes have been
[28:56.760 --> 29:03.960]  committed premeditatedly and that now the only question is will these these hitlerian type crimes
[29:03.960 --> 29:11.800]  be punished yeah and you know um i hate to sound like a broken record on this but uh our founders
[29:11.800 --> 29:17.480]  many of them from virginia where i'm from uh had a very specific way of handling this kind of
[29:17.480 --> 29:22.920]  situation and it's called impeachment it was mentioned in the constitution six times and
[29:22.920 --> 29:29.560]  that why uh the democratic leadership particularly john konyers had a judiciary committee in the house
[29:29.560 --> 29:36.600]  why they shy away why they're uh so reluctant to to fulfill their constitutional duty is something
[29:36.600 --> 29:43.800]  that has me very very outraged and uh what we need to do is is have a grassroots movement to say look
[29:43.800 --> 29:50.280]  you know there are so many crimes high crimes and misdemeanors here uh the question is uh
[29:50.280 --> 29:56.440]  outrage fatigue you know which ones do we do which ones do we pick three did it for nixon
[29:56.440 --> 30:03.640]  we have 35 from kucinich on bush let's pick out three and go for it okay we have one of the senior
[30:03.640 --> 30:08.200]  cianalysts for ronald reagan and george bush senior on with us reima govern we're gonna come back
[30:08.200 --> 30:12.120]  and go through the consequences for those that think this will be at something to watch on tv
[30:12.840 --> 30:15.080]  uh a new war it will not be that

[34:01.080 --> 34:08.280]  the point he's making is that a lot of people who don't know how the world works we haven't studied
[34:08.280 --> 34:15.720]  the basics don't understand the magnitude of the fact that this war is already one of the main
[34:15.720 --> 34:20.600]  reasons you're paying four dollars and fifteen cents a gallon on average it's one reason our name
[34:20.600 --> 34:27.640]  is now absolutely hated we are seen as the old soviet union we're seen as the evil empire by the
[34:27.640 --> 34:35.960]  world and the elites here are showing the exact pattern than other elites have shown the most
[34:35.960 --> 34:44.680]  virulent the napoleans the hitlers the mousetungs the joseph stallens very virulent
[34:44.680 --> 34:51.560]  the worst nightmare i mean the worst scenario you can imagine the us falling into the hands
[34:51.560 --> 34:56.920]  of absolute criminals the democrats acquiescing because they're bought and paid for by the same
[34:56.920 --> 35:03.720]  power mad corporate interest and reymer governs our guests to talk about not just what's currently
[35:03.720 --> 35:07.480]  happening in iraq i want to get into that some with him and some new reports that have come out
[35:07.480 --> 35:13.800]  from the gao but of course what's happening uh in iran and and what those consequences will be and
[35:13.800 --> 35:21.160]  now the fact that israel the united states and others especially israel are saying we're doing
[35:21.160 --> 35:26.200]  nuclear attack drills we're doing emergency drills we're preparing to attack we're going to attack
[35:26.200 --> 35:31.480]  bush met with us and he said he's going to attack he's going to support us and and so you've got
[35:31.480 --> 35:36.120]  that message in the international press the domestically uh they put out more disowned
[35:36.120 --> 35:40.920]  disinfo about we found iraqi weapons that were given to him by the iranians that's on the front
[35:40.920 --> 35:45.960]  page then a week later it's in the back of the paper that it wasn't true classic psyops reymer
[35:45.960 --> 35:53.480]  govern break it down for us uh what we're facing uh and hopefully how we can possibly stop this but
[35:53.480 --> 36:00.120]  but what those consequences will be well the consequences would be catastrophic would make
[36:01.000 --> 36:08.040]  the situation in iraq in iraq look like a you know a woman's high school volleyball game you know
[36:08.040 --> 36:15.400]  uh the iranians have uh well they have an army they have an air force they have a navy um they
[36:15.400 --> 36:20.600]  have everything that the iraq did not have the prostrate as it was after the sanctions and after
[36:20.600 --> 36:26.200]  losing the gulf war so they have all that are ways to retaliate but the thing that bothers me most
[36:26.200 --> 36:30.760]  of course is a well phenomena officer previous army officers that they have the capability
[36:30.760 --> 36:37.640]  to uh cut our supply lines between kuwait and bag dead and take hostage uh you know several tens
[36:37.640 --> 36:43.880]  of thousands of troops uh this this is a real deal and you know what do you say then to to the
[36:44.440 --> 36:48.280]  commander in chief well you know what we're going to do you know say well send more send
[36:48.280 --> 36:54.840]  reinforcements well as you know alex there aren't any reinforcements to send the right that's why
[36:54.840 --> 36:59.560]  there's no more surge they had to take those people out and so well well what else we got well
[36:59.560 --> 37:04.680]  we got these mini nukes you know that's what they're for and these people don't make any
[37:04.680 --> 37:10.760]  distinction between a high explosive weaponry and nuclear weaponry it's just incredible and so
[37:10.760 --> 37:16.920]  this thing could escalate very very quickly into a situation where we threaten the iranians with
[37:16.920 --> 37:22.440]  the use of nuclear weapons and they have to deal with that whether we make good of that on that
[37:22.440 --> 37:29.000]  threat or not if you know even more uh more disturbing but uh this could lead to that now
[37:29.000 --> 37:35.480]  i'd be more interested in in exploring how this thing could get underway how the iranians are no
[37:35.480 --> 37:43.160]  dopes they're not going to be provoked into uh doing a kind of attack on israel or us forces
[37:44.120 --> 37:51.240]  that would give us an excuse and the israeli's an excuse to really zap them uh and what i mean
[37:51.240 --> 37:57.560]  by really zap them is go after the lion share of their nuclear related activities in iran
[37:57.560 --> 38:04.360]  and so what's likely to happen well i think more likely than anything would be the kind of what we
[38:04.360 --> 38:11.080]  call in the trade here in the intelligence trade a false flag attack okay you get a boat all painted
[38:11.080 --> 38:18.280]  up with iranian colors and and you think uh destroyer uh us destroyer escorted the gulf wow
[38:19.160 --> 38:25.240]  you know you kill a bunch of americans uh that could set things off now who would do that who
[38:25.240 --> 38:30.840]  has an interest to who would uh you know qui bonham we used to say who would have an interest
[38:30.840 --> 38:36.120]  to who would profit from that kind of thing well it's very clear that the state of israel would
[38:36.120 --> 38:43.000]  because many of those uh extreme leaders think that they have to move against iran before bush
[38:43.000 --> 38:47.560]  leaves office and we know israel has done a lot of false flags before that's declassified in public
[38:47.560 --> 38:54.440]  knowledge yeah and you know most people don't realize that uh you know 1967 they tried to
[38:54.440 --> 39:01.880]  sink the uss liberty killed 34 of our sailors and wounded 172 of them and this was suppressed
[39:01.880 --> 39:07.960]  and this was not investigated and now we finally have the death of one of the lawyers that was
[39:07.960 --> 39:14.040]  asked by lbj to make it look like a just a mistaken identity thing on the part of the israelis
[39:14.040 --> 39:18.840]  but we have the tapes our example we have the we have the israeli pilot thing well wait a second
[39:18.840 --> 39:25.320]  is it american flag well it's an american ship take it out anyway you know so you know it the
[39:25.320 --> 39:29.960]  there's no question but that was a deliberate attack and by the way sir now that that's come
[39:29.960 --> 39:35.400]  out in the last few months chicago tribune and has meted neocons are on websites saying good
[39:35.400 --> 39:41.240]  it was a greater sacrifice for israel and now they're saying israel comes before the us and
[39:41.240 --> 39:47.880]  that almost like our sailors needed to die and that it was a good thing so you know it is really
[39:47.880 --> 39:53.800]  very very strange i mean you go back to george washington and his warnings against passionate
[39:53.800 --> 40:00.440]  attachments of one country namely the u.s uh to the perceived strategic needs of another
[40:01.080 --> 40:05.560]  and he warned that this is a very very very dangerous kind of phenomenon and of course
[40:05.560 --> 40:12.680]  it's playing out here what over 200 years later um the president is openly described by
[40:12.680 --> 40:19.880]  i well the fellow that i would i would i would describe as having the most experience of anyone
[40:19.880 --> 40:25.080]  in washington that's general brent skokroff to his the national security advisor to the first
[40:25.080 --> 40:32.200]  president bush um he felt that it necessary while he was still serving as the younger bush's
[40:33.160 --> 40:38.840]  chair of the farm of the president's foreign intelligence advisory board he felt that necessary
[40:38.840 --> 40:46.840]  to go to the financial times and say you know you should know that george w bush has been mesmerized
[40:46.840 --> 40:54.040]  by israeli then prime minister ariel charon that charon has him wrapped around his little finger
[40:54.920 --> 41:01.880]  now you know alex as an intelligence analyst there are very there are various degrees of
[41:02.680 --> 41:08.280]  reports that you give credibility to well you know this is horse mouth stuff this is skokroff
[41:08.280 --> 41:13.880]  watching what's going on in u.s policy toward the middle east having a catbird seat with all
[41:13.880 --> 41:20.280]  the sensitive information skokroff to the who is the consulate bureaucrat it would never say
[41:20.280 --> 41:26.920]  anything to the president darn well well thought through going to the financial times and telling
[41:26.920 --> 41:31.880]  them that this was a very dangerous situation because for some reason or other israeli seem
[41:31.880 --> 41:36.360]  to have our president mesmerized now why would you do that i think he just wanted the rest of us
[41:36.360 --> 41:41.480]  to know that this is a very dangerous situation and it's playing out now there are only six months
[41:41.480 --> 41:46.520]  left and nobody's making any any secret of the fact that this is what the israeli this is the
[41:46.520 --> 41:51.960]  urgency for the israeli it's not that he's ryanian they get in oakley obama in six months nobody
[41:51.960 --> 41:59.240]  believes that it's just that this is the window that the israeli said perpetrate or precipitate
[41:59.240 --> 42:05.640]  or catalyze this kind of this kind of reaction that they hope to get from the iranians that the
[42:05.640 --> 42:11.000]  bush has already pledged publicly to jump in with both feet so that's the that's the situation
[42:11.000 --> 42:16.520]  what we need to do is uh sensitize the american people to say look you know who's who's running
[42:16.520 --> 42:22.120]  this country here who's responsible for the bill that is now in the senate and house which says
[42:22.120 --> 42:29.560]  that we should blockade iran an act of war who's responsible for that well we know because the
[42:29.560 --> 42:38.280]  american israel apac the organization that was in here two weeks ago were openly pressing for that
[42:38.280 --> 42:43.320]  and then of course they blockade is a major escalation of forces right up against each other
[42:43.880 --> 42:50.120]  blocking uh their uh travel back and forth through the straits there which is an economic
[42:50.120 --> 42:54.840]  and military act of war and then that's almost guaranteed to where they may not even have to
[42:54.840 --> 43:01.240]  stage a false flag of some type of incident might occur and as you you brought up how the the iranians
[43:01.240 --> 43:08.280]  have been very shrewd not being goaded uh into anything here mr mcgovern uh it's admitted that
[43:08.280 --> 43:13.000]  for four plus years new yorker magazines reported the white house confirmed last year that four
[43:13.000 --> 43:19.400]  wahhabist terror groups al-qaeda groups commanded by the number three of al-qaeda have been uh funded
[43:19.400 --> 43:26.520]  by u.s uh military and under the direction of the white house to carry out terror attacks
[43:26.520 --> 43:33.240]  targeting police dam schools all over iran and the iranians are suing the u.s for blowing up
[43:33.240 --> 43:37.960]  mass staging events and iran saying okay we're taking terror attacks we're taking military
[43:37.960 --> 43:43.400]  hits u.s special forces are commanding them domestically and our white house says yes we
[43:43.400 --> 43:49.800]  have forces in there six months ago put a press release out attacking you i mean can you imagine
[43:49.800 --> 43:56.120]  if iran had their special forces blowing up uh police stations in in in dallas texas or
[43:56.120 --> 44:01.080]  chicago well that's different that's different because they're the evil people come on helix
[44:01.080 --> 44:05.400]  they're the evil people and we have the white hat fun you know but i mean iran is taking this
[44:05.400 --> 44:11.240]  terror attacks every week blowing up mosques are i mean this is like a twilight zone episode
[44:11.240 --> 44:15.640]  right mcgovern did you ever think you'd see anything like this i did not although i've
[44:15.640 --> 44:21.240]  seen close to it uh alec said part of the reason they can take this is because it's so factless
[44:22.040 --> 44:27.320]  part of the reason they can take this is because the ns the national security council under bush
[44:27.320 --> 44:32.920]  doesn't know what it's doing and got a bunch of amateurs in what used to be the covert operations
[44:32.920 --> 44:40.280]  part of the cia uh the activity is not going to have much effect and so the iranians can kind of
[44:40.280 --> 44:46.680]  dust it off but you know what people need to realize is that the the majority in iran is
[44:46.680 --> 44:52.360]  is are the minorities okay there are more minority peoples in iran i'm talking about
[44:52.360 --> 44:58.280]  his areas i'm talking about bullies i'm talking about curds over 50 percent of the iranian
[44:58.280 --> 45:04.680]  population are minorities and so uh what this administration our administration thinks they
[45:04.680 --> 45:09.320]  can do is play around with these minorities and fund all kinds of terrorist little but all they're
[45:09.320 --> 45:13.400]  doing is getting more support for the central government that's exactly right and they can't
[45:13.400 --> 45:18.840]  they can't succeed at it and you know the the factlessness of this whole thing is you if you
[45:18.840 --> 45:25.480]  wrote a novel nobody would read it because it's too too strange so how do we stop it
[45:27.880 --> 45:33.720]  well you know alec said i've come to the conclusion that writing op ed isn't enough
[45:33.720 --> 45:41.560]  speaking wherever they'll listen to me isn't enough because uh i find myself speaking just
[45:42.360 --> 45:47.480]  before groups who are already persuaded that this is outrageous so i don't know how to
[45:47.480 --> 45:51.720]  skin this cat other than to think that maybe the time has come to put our bodies into it
[45:52.360 --> 45:58.680]  maybe the time has come to go into our senators and representatives of offices and and stay there
[45:58.680 --> 46:03.560]  and make sure that they know that you know we want to run this country we don't want apac we
[46:03.560 --> 46:09.400]  don't want the israel lobby to be leading us into a war from which we will suffer for decades and
[46:09.400 --> 46:15.160]  decades i've got my little granddaughter here she's 14 months and i look at her i say my goodness
[46:15.160 --> 46:21.800]  you know what is going to happen to little molly and her generation so what we need to do is to be
[46:21.800 --> 46:26.120]  a little less selfish and put our bodies into it because there is such a thing as too late
[46:26.680 --> 46:31.240]  i'm more than with the king said that very eloquently there is such a thing as too late
[46:31.240 --> 46:36.600]  and we're approaching that point within the next two months in my view well on a separate
[46:36.600 --> 46:40.680]  whole genre but it but it fits into this and then i want in the final segment talk about the
[46:40.680 --> 46:46.600]  degrading situation and the propaganda we're getting out of iraq um and different agencies putting
[46:46.600 --> 46:53.640]  out different uh you know sides of that i was in dc to cover bill de berger a few weeks ago i have
[46:53.640 --> 47:00.600]  been in london i've been in california austin texas where i live and i watched police harassing
[47:00.600 --> 47:09.000]  tourist in dc who were at the national monument clearly families taking photos when there's no
[47:09.000 --> 47:16.760]  law i i watched police minding them like i was in you know 1970s havana cuba uh i i have police
[47:16.760 --> 47:21.240]  walk up to me in austin and say turn your camera off or i'll take it uh and telling me i can't
[47:21.240 --> 47:26.360]  protest or can't stand on the street with the sandwich board saying i'm for ron paul or i'm
[47:26.360 --> 47:31.240]  against the war uh in in england they admittedly now are just confiscating people's cameras the
[47:31.240 --> 47:37.560]  police admit they're provocaturing uh i mean i don't understand how they've gotten rank and
[47:37.560 --> 47:42.280]  file in the west i mean it's not just about iran it's not just about iraq there is a great
[47:42.280 --> 47:47.640]  darkness it's bigger than the neocons bigger than bush the establishment for some reason is going
[47:47.640 --> 47:55.080]  for broke to create classical tyranny by every yardstick it's just can you talk about that
[47:55.080 --> 47:59.080]  from your analyst perspective you're aware of all these things happening how is this i mean
[47:59.080 --> 48:05.480]  this is insane yeah i i think what you're about to ask is how is this possible and it's possible
[48:05.480 --> 48:13.720]  because of the media uh i call them the forning the forning corporate media people have no way
[48:13.720 --> 48:19.880]  of learning what's going on uh number two people are not very much affected in their own minds about
[48:19.880 --> 48:26.920]  this since they don't don't know of the the ramifications of being eavesdropped upon you
[48:26.920 --> 48:30.840]  know you have to get your neighbor don't you care that your private conversations on the
[48:30.840 --> 48:35.720]  telephone of being monitored uh what do you get you get the answer well i'm not talking to us i'm
[48:35.720 --> 48:39.480]  a bit loud you know with most you know but it's worse than that all over the country they're
[48:39.480 --> 48:43.400]  training grade school kids to report on their parents and then admitting it on the news like
[48:43.400 --> 48:51.400]  it's good yeah yeah so uh the the center is really just completely changed in in the country
[48:51.400 --> 48:56.120]  you know we've got to find some ways to write that which is not going to be very easy but
[48:56.120 --> 49:02.120]  with them with the media i mean that that's just the sea change alex you know when i look back at
[49:02.120 --> 49:08.280]  watergate where i was you know reading every every word of the washington post and following it like
[49:08.280 --> 49:14.280]  for two years uh i mean that was the height that was where people were the press the media really
[49:14.280 --> 49:20.520]  uh really came into its own uh you look now you look at the papers today look at the times look
[49:20.520 --> 49:25.240]  at the post there's not a word the new york times wrote an apologetic piece this weekend
[49:25.240 --> 49:35.000]  basically like tortures no big deal well yeah it's uh it it's really reached uh really
[49:35.000 --> 49:41.240]  reached dangerous proportions and what i what i compared to is the situation in nazi germany
[49:41.800 --> 49:49.000]  in 1933 where everyone cooperated i mean you take the churches now one might expect or one might
[49:49.000 --> 49:54.360]  hope at least for a moral stance to be taken by the by the church by the institutional
[49:54.360 --> 50:00.120]  churches in this country what about the methodist church push and cheney both both claim to be
[50:00.120 --> 50:05.240]  methodists do methodists approve this kind of torture they should throw them out they should throw
[50:05.240 --> 50:09.800]  cheney and bush out shouldn't they yeah well at least they should make a moral statement so what
[50:09.800 --> 50:16.360]  you have as you had in germany in 33 you have the catholic and the Lutheran churches uh throwing
[50:16.360 --> 50:22.360]  in there there a lot with the government not finding their voice and so it's up to people like us
[50:22.360 --> 50:28.040]  to do what we can and uh you know whether we're successful or not uh well it's not about being
[50:28.040 --> 50:33.800]  successful it's about being faithful it's about being uh having integrity and speaking out and
[50:33.800 --> 50:39.240]  making sure people know what's going on because if people aren't affected immediately as they
[50:39.240 --> 50:42.920]  weren't affected you know it was only those little jews my neighbors the jews that would
[50:42.920 --> 50:48.680]  be encarted off you know it's only those kids in the in the the small towns of america that are
[50:48.680 --> 50:54.120]  going off to iraq you know unless people start identifying with their brothers you know unless
[50:54.120 --> 51:00.120]  they they come back to the bedrock principle that we are after all our brothers keepers we should
[51:00.120 --> 51:06.920]  worry about these small kids from the from the farms in the inner cities unless they we have
[51:06.920 --> 51:13.560]  this moral conversion uh i dare say it's uh the prospects are not good rand mcgovern stay there i want
[51:13.560 --> 51:18.600]  to come back and talk about iraq the deteriorating situation there deteriorating in afghanistan
[51:18.600 --> 51:24.680]  as well rapidly meanwhile bush and his cronies are commanding armies that don't exist but i
[51:24.680 --> 51:29.800]  believe they plan to fail forward they want to get us into a war so big that they can then escalate
[51:29.800 --> 51:36.280]  we'll be right back now from the makers of loose change the most downloading film in internet history

[52:54.040 --> 53:00.360]  lawsuit filed against him by the venomous nebraska state senator the serpentine suit accusing god
[53:00.360 --> 53:05.720]  of widespread terrorism and destruction the court clerk said that an answer to the suit
[53:05.720 --> 53:11.640]  just miraculously appeared in his courthouse office the clerk said there was no contact
[53:11.640 --> 53:17.640]  information on the filing but saint michael the archangel was listed as a witness and what was
[53:17.640 --> 53:24.200]  said in the filing in summary two things basically i am now reading from the associator press article
[53:24.200 --> 53:31.800]  that reported it quote not so says god his response argues that the defendant is immune
[53:31.800 --> 53:38.840]  to some earthly laws and that the court lacks jurisdiction it adds that blaming god for human
[53:38.840 --> 53:46.440]  oppression and suffering misses an important point in the quote then that point was made
[53:46.440 --> 53:56.040]  and it was a profound point that all need yay must know and know now and the point is well
[53:56.680 --> 54:03.640]  it is another untold story and is made and posted for a limited time at another untold story dot

[54:35.880 --> 54:40.440]  into the next hour then we've got the director of harp joining us talk about that program
[54:40.440 --> 54:46.600]  him current head of it well the heads of three different programs in inside the harp program
[54:47.320 --> 54:50.200]  ray mcgovern now one of the chief analysts for ronald reagan george bush senior
[54:51.960 --> 54:56.280]  we're in the times that try men's souls i feel sorry for these little neocon followers that
[54:56.280 --> 55:00.680]  don't understand they're gonna be paying 10 12 bucks a gallon for gas bare minimum if this attack
[55:00.680 --> 55:06.600]  happens um i was just talking to you during the break ray about the police state in this country
[55:06.600 --> 55:12.600]  you said yeah i've been arrested and convicted of unlawful assembly and i mean you can be a new
[55:12.600 --> 55:16.120]  york anywhere austin texas and they'll walk over and say you're not allowed to stand here on the
[55:16.120 --> 55:21.320]  street corner there could be a guy with a sandwich board advertising tax preparation he's fine but
[55:21.320 --> 55:27.480]  you can't and uh i think it's they just haven't taught our bill of rights constitution the schools
[55:27.480 --> 55:32.920]  but before we get into iraq can you speak to that yeah it's very disturbing uh you had your own
[55:32.920 --> 55:37.640]  experience at the builder berg thing i'm sure you've shared that with your audience and uh
[55:37.640 --> 55:46.360]  uh you know people are becoming more repressed and more fearful um this is taking many many
[55:46.360 --> 55:51.720]  manifestations so one of the neat thing that's going on is that people are pushing the pushing
[55:51.720 --> 55:57.400]  the the envelope here pushing back yeah poll calling rally for example out there in minnesota
[55:57.400 --> 56:03.800]  uh if she was the fbi whistleblower you may recall during 9-11 she's taken to more mundane
[56:03.800 --> 56:09.160]  activities uh encouraging and preparing herself these great big banners that they put over
[56:09.160 --> 56:15.160]  overpasses on the minnesota highways why because it's legal that's why and she she says the the
[56:15.160 --> 56:19.640]  hunks that they're getting and the support that they're getting is really masterful and this
[56:19.640 --> 56:23.880]  is spreading throughout the whole country it's something easily done all you have to do is
[56:23.880 --> 56:28.200]  establish that it's legal and that nobody you know nobody drops any of these banners and calls
[56:28.200 --> 56:33.560]  that accident caused an accident so there are people pushing back but it's the repression
[56:33.560 --> 56:39.160]  seems to be on the uh you know on the offensive here and we well that's premeditated they know
[56:39.160 --> 56:43.880]  that what they're doing is illegal wrong and constitutional despotic and then you're seeing
[56:43.880 --> 56:49.720]  the final uh equation in that where they come in with the suppression but i i've heard the saying
[56:49.720 --> 56:54.040]  make a dictator act like a dictator i think this is backfiring on them i don't think they're going
[56:54.040 --> 56:59.080]  to get the total acquiescence like they got in germany here well i certainly hope not and we're
[56:59.080 --> 57:06.280]  not quite there yet but uh i am very very disturbed at the passivity you know at the uh at the kind
[57:06.280 --> 57:12.600]  of uh what shall we say indolence so that people just uh part of it is economic they you know most
[57:12.600 --> 57:16.600]  people have two jobs these days that have time to think about these things and to just let them
[57:16.600 --> 57:21.160]  slide so we have to sensitize them to it that's right gotta have a job just to pay for your
[57:21.160 --> 57:26.680]  gasoline to get to the other job um you know reading over what special forces what the cia
[57:26.680 --> 57:32.040]  did into spotted countries to overthrow them i'm not calling for violence but some of the nonviolent
[57:32.040 --> 57:38.120]  things the info war using the weapons of the truth i prosecute this like a war and i think my
[57:38.120 --> 57:44.680]  listeners they're doing that that's why we're so successful here in banner hangs micro fm uh going
[57:44.680 --> 57:49.080]  into classrooms and handing out you know dvds about what's happening i mean all of us have to
[57:49.080 --> 57:53.720]  get really aggressive right now against this tyranny or the or it's going to go to another level
[57:53.720 --> 57:59.960]  um you know national draft police state martial law do you agree with that statement well i think
[57:59.960 --> 58:06.360]  the danger is there alex and uh you know all we need is a another terrorist attack and uh
[58:06.920 --> 58:12.520]  mccain's uh good friend there said this would really help mccain will help this regime as well
[58:12.520 --> 58:17.720]  well god knows you know it's got some of the regulations already prepared to even do things
[58:17.720 --> 58:23.240]  like impose martial law and postpone the election so yeah this is a very dangerous time i can't
[58:23.240 --> 58:28.360]  conceive of a more dangerous time on our country's history at least during my lifetime okay the next
[58:28.360 --> 58:36.920]  six months i think it's as dangerous as trinton uh in 1770 was it seven i mean i can't think of a
[58:36.920 --> 58:44.120]  more more dangerous time yeah yeah it's just unbelievable when we come back five final minutes
[58:44.120 --> 58:49.320]  of ray mcgovern back in 60 seconds we're gonna talk about the iraq situation but yeah i hardly got into

[1:00:26.520 --> 1:00:38.120]  listening to we the people radio network big brother mainstream media government cover-ups
[1:00:38.680 --> 1:00:48.040]  you want answers well so does he he's alex jones on the gcn radio network and now live from austin
[1:00:48.040 --> 1:00:55.720]  texas alex jones we're gonna get him up for a full hour in the near future it's just such a great
[1:00:55.720 --> 1:01:01.080]  mind and his predictions have unfortunately all come true and unfolded we only got a five minutes
[1:01:01.080 --> 1:01:04.920]  left with him and i forgot to ask him this question should have been an off air but i really want his
[1:01:04.920 --> 1:01:10.360]  perspective because lately i've had like army intelligence types come up and you know i'm in
[1:01:10.360 --> 1:01:15.000]  a restaurant and say little threatening things or let me see they're following me let me know
[1:01:15.000 --> 1:01:19.240]  they're there it happened a lot in virginia hey do you want to attack the state department with us
[1:01:19.240 --> 1:01:23.240]  and then a day later they're on the bill derberg property with binoculars and but you're laughing
[1:01:23.240 --> 1:01:29.400]  at me following us wearing clown masks you know just a lot i'm actually having the black ops now
[1:01:29.960 --> 1:01:35.880]  physically mess with me and uh it's why do you think they're doing that ray are they starting
[1:01:35.880 --> 1:01:39.640]  to get worried about us and is this a a desperate attempt because it's not going to intimidate me
[1:01:41.080 --> 1:01:46.040]  well won't intimidate you alex but they're hoping that it would intimidate others and that's you
[1:01:46.040 --> 1:01:51.240]  know that's part and parcel of their approach take torture for example you know they know it
[1:01:51.240 --> 1:01:57.480]  doesn't work and where do you do it well one of the reasons is because they want us to know that
[1:01:57.480 --> 1:02:02.440]  they can do that they want us to know that they can do that to american citizens as they have to
[1:02:02.440 --> 1:02:08.840]  to several also uh torture is kind of a good way to get the kind of information that you want you
[1:02:08.840 --> 1:02:13.240]  know it doesn't have to be accurate uh you just have to tell egyptians or whatever it is so you
[1:02:13.240 --> 1:02:19.320]  know to get the right kind of answers to questions so you know the the total absence of any regard
[1:02:19.320 --> 1:02:25.240]  for the truth and the total absence of any regard for the constitution is about the most unsettling
[1:02:25.240 --> 1:02:29.480]  situation but what about these farm boys they get out of college who five years later are
[1:02:29.480 --> 1:02:33.800]  threatening alex jones and i would imagine you've had some of that same stuff happen to you i mean
[1:02:33.800 --> 1:02:41.400]  how do they get these guys to do this well uh i don't know uh part of it has to do with the
[1:02:41.400 --> 1:02:46.120]  educational opportunities such as they are in this country part of it has to do with the macho
[1:02:46.120 --> 1:02:52.040]  culture and the uh and the media once again i think the media is the prime culprit so they
[1:02:52.040 --> 1:02:57.960]  think they're jack bowyer and i'm al-qaeda yeah and you know jack bowyer you know curiously enough
[1:02:57.960 --> 1:03:04.360]  don't get mow jack bowyer was the or 24 whatever it's called was the big uh big attraction they
[1:03:04.360 --> 1:03:09.080]  all watched that and they drew lessons from that then actually they implemented some of those tactics
[1:03:09.640 --> 1:03:15.000]  not realizing that they would be counterproductive not realizing that the fact the fbi was right
[1:03:15.000 --> 1:03:21.560]  you don't get accurate information this way but was just chaos chaos very well unbelievable orchestrated
[1:03:21.560 --> 1:03:28.440]  in closing iraq new info came out from the gao yeah you know this surge business uh we had it
[1:03:28.440 --> 1:03:34.440]  begged from the outset the surge only had to do with preventing a definitive loss in iraq before
[1:03:34.440 --> 1:03:41.080]  dick cheney and and george bush left and so what we have now is the end of the surge no more troops
[1:03:41.080 --> 1:03:46.680]  to surge anymore uh it'll go back to the way it was even though the the violence is down
[1:03:46.680 --> 1:03:53.400]  temporarily and uh there's no plan for post surge and that's what the government accountability
[1:03:53.400 --> 1:03:59.480]  office uh made to clear in their report and of course the state department non-concurs
[1:04:00.120 --> 1:04:05.480]  and the defense department says no no you get it all wrong well i've been through this before
[1:04:05.480 --> 1:04:11.400]  the name of that one was vietnam you couldn't trust the army because they were an interested party uh
[1:04:11.400 --> 1:04:17.080]  they were not telling the truth thank goodness we have a government accountability project which
[1:04:17.080 --> 1:04:22.360]  is run by the congress not by the administration they're telling like it is and the situation is
[1:04:22.360 --> 1:04:27.320]  no better now than it was before the surge as a matter of fact it's a little bit worse because
[1:04:27.320 --> 1:04:33.160]  the objectives of the surge namely a political accommodation which would allow us to to with
[1:04:33.160 --> 1:04:39.880]  to our gradually that's as far uh in the future as ever all we've got or all our oil companies
[1:04:39.880 --> 1:04:45.720]  have got out of this is uh the permission to go back in there and extract oil and you know people
[1:04:45.720 --> 1:04:51.000]  who say this has nothing to do with oil well look what's happening now well exactly a credit
[1:04:51.000 --> 1:04:58.280]  artificial scarcity which is what they were mad at saddam for over pumping in 1990 yeah it's uh you
[1:04:58.280 --> 1:05:08.520]  know the the strategic strategic games here are the same as they've been since since world war two
[1:05:09.560 --> 1:05:16.040]  secure the safe delivery of oil and gas from that part of the world and secure israel and it's uh
[1:05:16.040 --> 1:05:20.360]  what they hoped would be internationally recognized borders right in the government we're out of time

[1:08:58.440 --> 1:09:04.280]  directorate on ed kennedy u.s. naval research laboratory dr paul cosy heart program manager
[1:09:04.280 --> 1:09:10.040]  for the air force research laboratory space vehicles directorate and uh we just got a call
[1:09:10.040 --> 1:09:17.000]  from the public relations spokesman for kirkland air force base and we're talking to him he says
[1:09:17.000 --> 1:09:21.880]  they're about to call in so we hope they come on you know we've had a few guests on talking about
[1:09:21.880 --> 1:09:29.080]  what they believe heart does what they admit it does and i thought you know why not and and
[1:09:29.080 --> 1:09:33.880]  train my producer thought why not get the people from harp on we had general parton on years ago
[1:09:33.880 --> 1:09:38.840]  who headed up the air forces stuff on and he wouldn't talk about it i mean add him on about
[1:09:38.840 --> 1:09:43.800]  some other issues with the military and he was actually talking about his sino so he had split
[1:09:44.520 --> 1:09:48.200]  paper he wrote that was then adopted into policy and then thrown out of policy
[1:09:49.320 --> 1:09:54.600]  back in the 60s he came the head of air force weapons development and just while we had him on
[1:09:54.600 --> 1:09:59.000]  we took a call and the caller said you directed harp and he said well i'm not going to get into
[1:09:59.000 --> 1:10:05.960]  it as classified so we'll see if these guys will come on and i mean tell us what harp is at least
[1:10:05.960 --> 1:10:10.760]  from their perspective or what they can tell us i mean i mean they were very helpful tray called
[1:10:10.760 --> 1:10:14.360]  them last week and just said i want somebody on from harp and they called back and said okay jim
[1:10:14.360 --> 1:10:21.080]  baits harp program air force research laboratory space vehicles directory what is harp doing with
[1:10:21.080 --> 1:10:26.280]  space vehicles i mean there is this for scanning for satellites or missiles that's what i was always
[1:10:26.280 --> 1:10:31.800]  told is that it was an over the horizon radar system that went into space as well but parton
[1:10:31.800 --> 1:10:36.680]  wouldn't talk about that but he did say it had something to do with that uh ed kennedy us naval
[1:10:36.680 --> 1:10:43.000]  research laboratory we've had doled up in limxton on who was the there for a while ahead of it with
[1:10:43.000 --> 1:10:46.200]  weather weapons that was interesting that was declassified i mean we just try to bring you
[1:10:46.200 --> 1:10:53.640]  these are really interesting things and we like to go directly to the source uh of uh where this
[1:10:54.760 --> 1:10:59.400]  where these programs are being carried out and we did announce we were having these guests on
[1:10:59.400 --> 1:11:05.720]  them we're a controversial show and talking to the um public relations guy he was saying
[1:11:05.720 --> 1:11:09.400]  what do you want them on about and i said look i'm having them on about whatever they want to say
[1:11:10.520 --> 1:11:13.640]  and i am here in the lurch uh john have we gotten any of these guys on
[1:11:15.880 --> 1:11:18.680]  they have not called in and do we still have uh the fellow who's
[1:11:20.200 --> 1:11:25.560]  mike is listening in go go ask him what the et here is because i don't like doing this
[1:11:25.560 --> 1:11:30.200]  and we have to reschedule them that's fine i don't want to make a big issue out of this we just
[1:11:30.200 --> 1:11:35.320]  wanted to have them on kind of like it was declassified that the whole what the the weather
[1:11:35.320 --> 1:11:43.800]  weapons programs up till 75 and before it was any any in any news article uh i said wow my listeners
[1:11:43.800 --> 1:11:48.280]  have sent me these declassified documents and they were online library of congress i said i better
[1:11:48.280 --> 1:11:53.560]  call ben livingston and he was up in uh the panhandle of texas running a weather control company
[1:11:53.560 --> 1:11:59.240]  uh and uh we flimmed austin had him on and he had talked about how they controlled hurricane
[1:11:59.240 --> 1:12:06.680]  steered them directed them and uh then fox news ap and others picked up on that coast to coast
[1:12:06.680 --> 1:12:12.520]  am and we do have some of the stuff that's been declassified about harp here and i thought why
[1:12:12.520 --> 1:12:17.880]  not go directly to the source instead of instead of have people claim harp does this or harp does
[1:12:17.880 --> 1:12:24.760]  that i don't know what it does because it's classified so we just wanted to get the word from them
[1:12:26.760 --> 1:12:31.880]  oh fantastic uh dr paul cosy heart program manager for the air force research laboratory
[1:12:31.880 --> 1:12:37.880]  space vehicles directorate doctor did i get that title correct uh that's correct well this is just
[1:12:37.880 --> 1:12:45.080]  amazing to have you uh on with us uh what is harp i mean there's so many rumors flying around
[1:12:45.080 --> 1:12:49.320]  so many different things that have been said one time i had an air force retired general on
[1:12:50.120 --> 1:12:55.240]  about a you know a totally different issue and a caller called it and said you were the director
[1:12:55.240 --> 1:13:00.200]  of harp for the air force and he wouldn't talk about it so so i appreciate you guys coming on
[1:13:00.200 --> 1:13:08.680]  what is harp well i i i always have to smile because we certainly do like to talk about what
[1:13:08.680 --> 1:13:16.040]  harp is because there's certainly a lot of what it isn't it's been a favorite program in the growth
[1:13:16.040 --> 1:13:21.000]  of the internet we started about the time the internet did and somehow it got picked up and
[1:13:21.000 --> 1:13:29.640]  became a kind of a favorite blog for a lot of people unfortunately uh what harp is and versus
[1:13:29.640 --> 1:13:35.400]  what it isn't they're so different that it's it's hard to even get into that so in terms of what it
[1:13:35.400 --> 1:13:44.600]  so in terms of what it is it's a research facility to conduct research in ionosphere and radio science
[1:13:45.160 --> 1:13:51.800]  much like the type that started way back in the days of marconi in the early 1900s whenever they
[1:13:51.800 --> 1:13:58.280]  discovered that radio waves somehow got across the ocean which was a great surprise and that led to a
[1:13:58.280 --> 1:14:05.400]  whole growth of uh science in understanding uh the ionosphere radio waves and the physics and the
[1:14:05.400 --> 1:14:11.160]  chemistry of all those things that even led to sonar and uh well that's right that's that's the
[1:14:11.160 --> 1:14:17.880]  acoustic type wave it goes underwater but but even in terms of the radio science and ionospheric work
[1:14:19.000 --> 1:14:26.680]  that caught on for tens of years and over time it's led to obviously development of many systems
[1:14:26.680 --> 1:14:32.360]  that we're very familiar with and quite happy with including our modern communication systems
[1:14:32.360 --> 1:14:39.240]  and satellite calm and long distance calm and even the global positioning radio system which
[1:14:40.200 --> 1:14:45.480]  grew out of this type research so what harp is is really kind of modern day version
[1:14:46.120 --> 1:14:52.760]  and capabilities to extend and do those kind of studies we hope well into the next century
[1:14:52.760 --> 1:14:59.720]  so it's it's radio science it's ionosphere physics and chemistry and even space science
[1:14:59.720 --> 1:15:05.640]  because radio waves indeed go out into space yeah what is this part about uh space vehicles
[1:15:05.640 --> 1:15:12.360]  directorate well those are some of the arcane uh names to get put on organization but in terms of
[1:15:13.240 --> 1:15:20.200]  the air force research laboratory there are a number of directorates that focus in certain
[1:15:20.200 --> 1:15:28.200]  technology areas like uh aerospace uh sensors and space vehicles does
[1:15:29.640 --> 1:15:36.120]  can note in in many senses why because harp might be used to detect satellites or icbm's or
[1:15:37.320 --> 1:15:41.160]  let me just say what the organization is and you'll see how we're in there
[1:15:43.000 --> 1:15:48.920]  the space people has to do with a lot of the work in that in the directorate is involved with
[1:15:48.920 --> 1:15:54.360]  with planning uh new satellite systems or demonstrations and remember it's a research lab
[1:15:54.360 --> 1:15:59.400]  the most of the thing yeah so there's lots of different uh experiments and programs that are
[1:15:59.400 --> 1:16:05.640]  going on and so the overall related to space and in in terms of the directed that that my group
[1:16:05.640 --> 1:16:12.440]  is involved with that we are part of that directorate uh in terms of uh uh the names
[1:16:12.440 --> 1:16:17.800]  well sir maybe the stories get started because there are so many different agencies and directorates
[1:16:17.800 --> 1:16:23.960]  and programs inside there that are compartmentalized uh i mean i have no doubt i mean i hear all
[1:16:23.960 --> 1:16:29.240]  sorts of wild stuff that's why we've got you on and so basically but there are parts of it
[1:16:29.240 --> 1:16:37.320]  that are classified obviously uh well let me put this way the harp program we're very very well
[1:16:37.320 --> 1:16:43.240]  known and known in the scientific community because a lot most of the work we do is is very basic
[1:16:43.240 --> 1:16:51.160]  basic research i must say and uh the description of the facility and and looking at it and seeing
[1:16:51.160 --> 1:16:57.880]  it is nothing classified about it it's there in many ways it's impressive because of its beautiful
[1:16:57.880 --> 1:17:04.920]  location and and it is a uh that's consistent that's a good question what is it what's on there i mean
[1:17:04.920 --> 1:17:12.040]  all these antennas what do they do okay those antennas are kind of if you like a kind of a
[1:17:12.040 --> 1:17:18.520]  special version of radio moscow or or the voice of america or the dbc they're high frequency
[1:17:19.080 --> 1:17:24.520]  trans it's a high frequency transmitting system shortwave transmitting system basically however
[1:17:24.520 --> 1:17:32.120]  it's a transmitting system to do research and the energy from those transmitters and the antennas
[1:17:32.120 --> 1:17:38.520]  are directed upward they rest in setting how radio waves interact up in the ionosphere we're talking
[1:17:38.520 --> 1:17:46.760]  about up over 50 60 up to hundreds of miles and even thousands of miles into space that's what the
[1:17:46.760 --> 1:17:55.400]  basic studies are involved with whereas uh voice of america uh more conventional hf system for
[1:17:55.400 --> 1:18:00.600]  communications or broadcasting music the energy is directed low and all the ground because you
[1:18:00.600 --> 1:18:05.240]  wanted to go far distance across the ocean and so sure but let's say voice of america is a million
[1:18:05.240 --> 1:18:11.720]  watts how many watts are you guys putting out we uh that's a good good example your voice of america
[1:18:11.720 --> 1:18:17.720]  is a radiated power of one million watts the uh completed heart facility which is the finished
[1:18:17.720 --> 1:18:25.000]  last year about this time is a little more than three and a half million watts three and a half
[1:18:25.000 --> 1:18:30.840]  million watts uh what about people that say that it's for weather control or weather modification
[1:18:30.840 --> 1:18:37.880]  well it has uh you know unfortunately it's totally off-based it has no interactions
[1:18:37.880 --> 1:18:44.520]  that affect anything with with weather systems remember these weather systems are relatively
[1:18:44.520 --> 1:18:49.720]  close to earth the jet stream and things like that are not all that high up there we're talking about
[1:18:50.360 --> 1:18:54.760]  the heart energy going up and interacting out in the
[1:18:54.760 --> 1:19:01.320]  areas the hundreds of miles into space this is even going into the van allen radiation belt
[1:19:01.320 --> 1:19:07.400]  isn't it uh well the radio waves is the high enough frequencies that can get through the
[1:19:07.400 --> 1:19:13.640]  eyes for god into deep space that's true yeah uh but i mean the russians do advertise that they
[1:19:13.640 --> 1:19:18.840]  have these radio arrays that they claim clear the skies that's like bbc news association press
[1:19:18.840 --> 1:19:24.120]  the communist chinese claim that they have smaller arrays that can manipulate the weather i mean can't
[1:19:24.120 --> 1:19:30.600]  you see that that's why people then think that what you're doing is similar to that well i don't know
[1:19:30.600 --> 1:19:35.960]  if i can see or even understand that it's just that it has nothing to do with heart has nothing to do
[1:19:35.960 --> 1:19:43.640]  with uh such things and in fact the uh the physical basis for for talking about that or
[1:19:43.640 --> 1:19:50.120]  interactions of radio waves to do things like that is unknown to me i must say as you say uh i don't
[1:19:50.120 --> 1:19:55.720]  know what the technical or physical base for people thinking that one could do that uh even where that
[1:19:55.720 --> 1:20:00.120]  comes from you think it's just more the russians making stuff up then
[1:20:03.080 --> 1:20:07.320]  i can't speak for the russians i'll i'll talk to you about heart but i have no idea what you're
[1:20:07.320 --> 1:20:13.880]  just saying or who's saying it that's the other okay fantastic doctor you've got you've got quite
[1:20:13.880 --> 1:20:17.720]  a bio i apologize for not properly introducing you stay right there so we're gonna be right back up

[1:22:47.880 --> 1:22:52.680]  responsibility for reigning the men and bringing them to justice all nations will participate
[1:22:52.680 --> 1:22:59.160]  since they reside the world over they are called illuminati elite proponents of the new world order
[1:22:59.160 --> 1:23:03.960]  they oppose everything that is god and truth they are of the line that was disinherited
[1:23:03.960 --> 1:23:08.280]  two thousand years ago everything they have built over the centuries the wealth they have

[1:24:50.280 --> 1:24:55.640]  just during the break i typed into google russians declare skies for parade i had
[1:24:55.640 --> 1:25:01.400]  to remember that headline from a few years ago and associated press headline nuclear missiles
[1:25:01.400 --> 1:25:09.880]  paraded across red square and then it says and then it goes into how they manipulated the weather
[1:25:10.440 --> 1:25:18.040]  with these different radio waves to clear the skies for the parade here is a another one
[1:25:18.040 --> 1:25:22.360]  about rush remembers world war two with lavish victor parade and it says that they use these
[1:25:22.360 --> 1:25:28.200]  antenna arrays to clear the sky so i think that's what gets tied in to heart because it looks similar
[1:25:28.200 --> 1:25:34.680]  and i was talking to the director uh dr paul cosy heart program manager for the air force research
[1:25:34.680 --> 1:25:40.760]  laboratory space vehicles director during the break and uh he was uh saying that that he had
[1:25:40.760 --> 1:25:45.800]  heard about some of those systems for knocking out fogs so some of you are saying you have
[1:25:45.800 --> 1:25:53.240]  or doctor read about radio type systems that do manipulate some of the weather
[1:25:53.800 --> 1:26:00.120]  for example to disperse fog now often that involves with a lot of uh i assume fans and things like
[1:26:00.120 --> 1:26:06.280]  that now uh the use of radio waves to do it is unbeknownst to me but i'm not i'm i don't have
[1:26:06.280 --> 1:26:11.000]  any confidence in that area and i'm not familiar with it and i'm not aware well well well well
[1:26:11.000 --> 1:26:15.480]  what findings is one of the top experts on heart of the world i mean what are some of the neat things
[1:26:15.480 --> 1:26:19.480]  that are declassified that you can talk about that you've been able to do with harp or what data
[1:26:19.480 --> 1:26:24.920]  have you learned i mean i well we just want to know well as i mentioned to you earlier harp is a
[1:26:25.720 --> 1:26:33.960]  a radio science dinosaur radio science program is is a kind of research that is is not new in a
[1:26:33.960 --> 1:26:40.360]  certain way it's been going on since the days of marco re to understand how radio waves interact with
[1:26:40.360 --> 1:26:46.520]  the atmosphere and space what what those mediums do to it under various conditions natural conditions
[1:26:46.520 --> 1:26:51.640]  when they're solar disturbances because we know for example or when they're solar disturbances
[1:26:51.640 --> 1:26:57.560]  certain radio waves can get affected even blacked out and you have to go to other systems or
[1:26:57.560 --> 1:27:03.800]  different radio frequencies and all this noise is gleaming over the years through radio science
[1:27:03.800 --> 1:27:11.160]  and ionistic science and research and harp is basically with the modern version to continue
[1:27:11.160 --> 1:27:17.720]  that research hopefully with with more sensitive instruments that are that are a diagnostic
[1:27:17.720 --> 1:27:24.200]  instrument and more flexibility to understand how radio waves interact in the ionic air and space
[1:27:25.080 --> 1:27:31.560]  and whether we can exploit those to improve communication navigation whatever radar system
[1:27:31.560 --> 1:27:37.160]  so it's nothing particularly new in terms of the ideas and concepts it's bringing more modern
[1:27:37.160 --> 1:27:45.160]  tools of better capabilities with with the new uh computer control systems the ways to uh
[1:27:45.160 --> 1:27:49.080]  but you're not denying that in separate government programs there's been weather
[1:27:49.080 --> 1:27:52.920]  modification and and and weather manipulation programs i mean those have been declassified
[1:27:54.040 --> 1:27:58.840]  well again i i'm not i'm not involved with such programs and i'm not familiar with them
[1:27:58.840 --> 1:28:03.000]  and i can't speak to them frankly how did you get into this i mean how did you decide to get a
[1:28:03.000 --> 1:28:09.720]  doctorate in in all of this uh well you don't want my history because uh my my graduate work
[1:28:09.720 --> 1:28:16.040]  was in an area solely outside of this but then i was uh uh brought brought into the air force as
[1:28:16.040 --> 1:28:23.240]  an officer in 1967 and assigned to the air force research lab up near boston and i learned basically
[1:28:23.240 --> 1:28:29.080]  an input new area outside of my php work but that was great that there's nothing wrong with that
[1:28:29.080 --> 1:28:35.000]  and i was assigned to a group radio science and ionic spirit science and and i like it so much
[1:28:35.000 --> 1:28:41.960]  that when my tool was up in four years i i signed on as a civilian employee of the laboratory and
[1:28:41.960 --> 1:28:45.880]  i've been there well you talked about a lot of other programs going on a lot of other
[1:28:45.880 --> 1:28:50.600]  directorates and groups i mean are you privy to all the programs going on with harp are you privy
[1:28:50.600 --> 1:28:58.280]  over one one directorate what do you mean the harp i'm the harp is assigned under the uh
[1:28:58.280 --> 1:29:05.400]  the record i'm in and uh it has no uh tentacles and no other wings and other places i'm not familiar
[1:29:05.400 --> 1:29:12.280]  with it it's a pretty uh self-contained program that you just said that there okay so it's one
[1:29:12.280 --> 1:29:15.880]  program there but i know there's a lot of other agencies and things that are there looking at
[1:29:15.880 --> 1:29:21.880]  the data and i guess uh you know i guess they get space on the system to to run their own test or
[1:29:21.880 --> 1:29:26.840]  i mean how many different agencies are involved looking at the data doing experiments well we
[1:29:26.840 --> 1:29:34.120]  have uh it's a joint program actually to set up as a joint program some years ago uh with the
[1:29:34.120 --> 1:29:40.200]  air force in the navy uh and then with with the participation of uh for example the uh
[1:29:40.200 --> 1:29:46.200]  dot brother the defense advantage research project agencies been involved in fact all three agencies
[1:29:47.000 --> 1:29:53.480]  were where the funders uh over at least four or five years that that basically brought the
[1:29:53.480 --> 1:30:01.400]  facility to their capability and had and so in terms of uh what harp can study radio waves
[1:30:01.400 --> 1:30:09.480]  interact with the united states and how they might be able to pass communication uh radars okay stay
[1:30:09.480 --> 1:30:14.440]  there sir final segment with our guests he's the director of the harp program dr paul cosy we

[1:33:42.120 --> 1:33:50.120]  don't want no shackles don't want no shackles on me we're back live ladies and gentlemen final
[1:33:50.120 --> 1:33:56.520]  segment with the director of the heart program manager for the air force research laboratory
[1:33:56.520 --> 1:34:02.920]  space vehicles director he's the head honcho over at all we're unable to get to dr jim baits on and
[1:34:02.920 --> 1:34:09.960]  ed kennedy the u.s. naval research laboratory at the end said oh we don't think we're gonna
[1:34:10.600 --> 1:34:16.360]  give him classification or allow him to go do that for some reason i mean if it's no big deal
[1:34:16.360 --> 1:34:22.520]  and during the break you guys were saying you might invite me up to a heart open house uh i mean
[1:34:22.520 --> 1:34:28.520]  doc if it's not anything so secret or anything why would why would the navy uh who originally
[1:34:28.520 --> 1:34:32.120]  wanted us to have ed kennedy on the daughter ed kennedy why would they not want him on with us
[1:34:33.080 --> 1:34:40.120]  no that that's a little unfair to what's what's going on just just like in our case the the uh
[1:34:40.120 --> 1:34:47.160]  agencies have public affairs office the kind of final and channel uh questions so that they're
[1:34:47.160 --> 1:34:52.520]  so that consistent and the right people are involved and that's usually done ahead of time unfortunately
[1:34:52.520 --> 1:35:00.760]  in this case um i i was only brought in fairly recently because i've been been out but uh it
[1:35:00.760 --> 1:35:07.080]  was worked through the air force uh at albuquerque and that was michael climbing in our offices i
[1:35:07.080 --> 1:35:12.440]  understand so it was just a snap because it was set up so the connection wasn't made through the navy
[1:35:12.440 --> 1:35:18.840]  offices uh and i wasn't realized until today i guess but normally i would have also that's
[1:35:18.840 --> 1:35:23.080]  that's bureaucracy they're mad that they weren't contacted i understand doctor just there wasn't
[1:35:23.080 --> 1:35:26.920]  going it didn't go through the public affairs office that's all that's always the case it has
[1:35:26.920 --> 1:35:33.000]  to be done uh it's just to have consistency and make sure the right people are involved and that
[1:35:33.000 --> 1:35:38.120]  there's you know not everyone knows how many interviews have you done doctor on harp i mean
[1:35:38.120 --> 1:35:46.760]  for radio or tv oh there's been quite a few with newspaper people and and uh magazine people and
[1:35:47.560 --> 1:35:54.360]  a couple times i guess uh not not live radio but the national public radio has asked questions and
[1:35:54.360 --> 1:35:58.840]  then they they actually send people to some of the open houses and get a little more involved
[1:35:58.840 --> 1:36:04.760]  to what's the best question you were ever asked what's that what's the best question uh you've
[1:36:04.760 --> 1:36:12.600]  ever been asked by the media well the unfortunately the questions are are more tied to what it is and
[1:36:12.600 --> 1:36:17.720]  and so uh so you get a lot of humorous questions asked which are hard to answer because you hard
[1:36:17.720 --> 1:36:22.280]  it's hard to say what you aren't you know it's just kind of like are you hiding space aliens in the
[1:36:22.280 --> 1:36:30.360]  basement yeah or or or say well you know one of the best questions i got i was from a phone
[1:36:30.360 --> 1:36:35.640]  call that went on for 15 minutes it went once from the lady in Alaska way in the early days of harp
[1:36:35.640 --> 1:36:42.840]  and that that was concerned and and she went on for 15 20 minutes and i patiently answered every
[1:36:42.840 --> 1:36:49.000]  question and then and i thought i had brought around understanding that we weren't harmful and in
[1:36:49.000 --> 1:36:53.560]  fact you know we work there we can't we were interested in our health too and things like
[1:36:53.560 --> 1:36:59.000]  that we went you know went on fools and i thought i convinced her that at the end of this 15 minutes
[1:36:59.000 --> 1:37:03.480]  she says that's what i thought you said and i don't still believe a word you said well you know
[1:37:03.480 --> 1:37:09.400]  you get demopilated in something like that you know you i asked like answered 50 questions from a very
[1:37:10.200 --> 1:37:15.400]  one at a time and very carefully and then the answer is well i thought you'd say that and i don't
[1:37:15.400 --> 1:37:20.280]  believe you so that's the kind of thing it's frustrating i understand i get accused of things
[1:37:20.280 --> 1:37:25.720]  that aren't true look i have no doubt that that most of the program is what you say it is uh and i'm
[1:37:25.720 --> 1:37:29.480]  sure that it does get confused with other programs other things that are going on because i've had
[1:37:29.480 --> 1:37:33.400]  the father or weather weapons on and you know there's all these declassified documents on that
[1:37:33.400 --> 1:37:38.280]  creating hurricanes steering them killing them in the sixties well i guess i again i see that and
[1:37:38.280 --> 1:37:43.480]  we've certainly been accused of that which is fascinating of course we're not you know it's
[1:37:43.480 --> 1:37:48.680]  totally off the wall but where those ideas come from even where's the physical basis for them
[1:37:48.680 --> 1:37:53.800]  because uh you know i'm not aware of any physical basis well the weather control is with cloud
[1:37:53.800 --> 1:37:59.080]  seeding the the documented standard research you know you're talking about maybe putting chemicals
[1:37:59.080 --> 1:38:04.920]  up in the cloud yeah you're not talking about uh let's see people believe that with harp that
[1:38:04.920 --> 1:38:10.120]  chemicals are put in and then so some of the scientists have said and then uh these these
[1:38:10.120 --> 1:38:17.880]  different radio uh arrays then somehow uh energize those those uh chemicals that have been put in the
[1:38:17.880 --> 1:38:24.200]  air those metals and that somehow that's uh part of a weather modification or or part of some type
[1:38:24.200 --> 1:38:29.960]  of over the horizon radar i'm not sure but those are the ideas i get i i see those things but i've
[1:38:29.960 --> 1:38:34.360]  just fabricated because i don't know what the technical basis and certainly it's nothing to do
[1:38:34.360 --> 1:38:40.120]  with with harp or any capability that harp would have but there is a lot of classified stuff you're
[1:38:40.120 --> 1:38:48.280]  doing though no that's me not in fact uh nothing i'm doing is classified uh well when i had general
[1:38:48.280 --> 1:38:53.160]  parton on who said decades ago he was involved uh in harp he wouldn't talk about it but i had him
[1:38:53.160 --> 1:38:57.240]  on about another subject and a caller called in and he just said it's all lies what you hear about
[1:38:57.240 --> 1:39:02.760]  it's lies well but it's classified now i'm gonna talk about it i don't know who's general part
[1:39:02.760 --> 1:39:10.520]  news or was but he's talking about decades ago harp harp is only uh got started even in the
[1:39:10.520 --> 1:39:17.720]  planning stages in the 1990s and we really only finished the site last february and are now using
[1:39:17.720 --> 1:39:24.040]  it uh uh well he was the head of air force weapons development and and he and he uh he said he'd
[1:39:24.040 --> 1:39:28.840]  been involved uh i think he got out in the early 90s so i'm not sure but you might look that up
[1:39:28.840 --> 1:39:35.880]  i'm i'm sure he he just wouldn't talk about it i'm the oldest person with the program i was with
[1:39:35.880 --> 1:39:41.320]  it from day one and and i know of no such connection with anyone like that and i'm you know that's
[1:39:41.320 --> 1:39:49.240]  just the fact are there other radio testing systems that can be confused with that again if
[1:39:49.240 --> 1:39:55.160]  you're talking about other facilities other programs but i'm not pretty i don't i'm not aware of them
[1:39:55.160 --> 1:40:03.880]  uh again harp uh it does its interactions out hundreds of miles up uh remember the things that
[1:40:03.880 --> 1:40:08.360]  control your weather are much closer to earth no i understand that you know airplanes apply to jet
[1:40:08.360 --> 1:40:15.160]  stream produce more power than what heart can but we know that the that the different um space
[1:40:15.880 --> 1:40:20.600]  waves the different uh types of particles that come into the atmosphere they're now saying that's a
[1:40:20.600 --> 1:40:27.000]  large part of our weather in the formation of clouds and let's be talking about that i mean
[1:40:27.000 --> 1:40:33.480]  that's a main line scientific uh you know the sun and and and uh different particles that yeah
[1:40:34.200 --> 1:40:40.920]  you know um solar solar certainly affects that uh but in terms of the interactions of radio waves
[1:40:40.920 --> 1:40:48.920]  such as harp uh uh they're they're puny remember lightning goes off tens of times the second all
[1:40:48.920 --> 1:40:56.920]  over the world and produces radio waves and strength and energy that that is dwarf anything
[1:40:57.560 --> 1:41:03.000]  oh i understand the sun is a huge man makes including huge broadcast or radio waves yeah
[1:41:03.000 --> 1:41:12.120]  i think it's just puny or puny in fact uh our interactions are so weak uh we need to be where
[1:41:12.120 --> 1:41:17.960]  we are because it's what we call relatively quiet from electrical noise and the interaction
[1:41:17.960 --> 1:41:23.000]  things we're studying that we can do with harp is so weak out in space that we need very sensitive
[1:41:23.000 --> 1:41:27.720]  interventions you have to detect them and just to try to understand it but they do produce
[1:41:28.600 --> 1:41:34.040]  method by which we can repeat experiments and try to understand the processes that occur in
[1:41:34.040 --> 1:41:42.040]  radio waves interacting in in a space medium and that's important uh and you understand
[1:41:43.640 --> 1:41:47.720]  what affects your radio waves good or bad well have you guys discovered anything i mean
[1:41:47.720 --> 1:41:52.760]  uh like a cyclotron you know discovers new particles i mean have you guys discovered uh
[1:41:52.760 --> 1:41:59.880]  any new theories or or ideas or or or uh different laws a lot of basic research to understand the
[1:42:00.440 --> 1:42:06.840]  the physical processes that occur when radio waves interact in an ionized medium up in space
[1:42:07.480 --> 1:42:14.920]  and and and then try to understand those and hopefully apply them to uh to uh applications
[1:42:14.920 --> 1:42:21.320]  related ideas the facility itself is for the research it's not an operational thing to communicate
[1:42:21.320 --> 1:42:25.400]  with them i'm pure i understand pure research uh what about other countries the russians the
[1:42:25.400 --> 1:42:31.480]  chinese the european union do they have similar programs doctor the uh the european community
[1:42:31.480 --> 1:42:37.800]  has a facility in the trompsville norway it's part of the what they call the ice gas community there
[1:42:37.800 --> 1:42:45.720]  that that actually was uh a facility like harp that's been around a lot longer than harp uh
[1:42:45.720 --> 1:42:51.640]  to do the same kind of uh relative kind of research to understand the uh uh physics and
[1:42:51.640 --> 1:42:57.720]  chemistry and radio wave interactions in space who do you pass your data on to once it's done
[1:42:57.720 --> 1:43:03.320]  well most of the work is published in open literature in fact if you go to uh to the scientific
[1:43:03.320 --> 1:43:11.240]  go to google scientific and type in harp you'll see uh tens and hundreds of hundreds of papers
[1:43:11.240 --> 1:43:16.200]  produced out of the research of harp and and you'll see the authors are leading scientists in
[1:43:16.200 --> 1:43:21.080]  the university communities for example and the government laboratories yeah you brought up
[1:43:21.080 --> 1:43:27.400]  published in the open literature we've been a subject of articles in prestigious journals such as
[1:43:27.400 --> 1:43:35.320]  nature uh and uh we are scientists participate in international conferences they're well known
[1:43:36.200 --> 1:43:41.160]  around the world it's very uh it's in the open literature sure shifting gears doctor
[1:43:41.160 --> 1:43:47.400]  challenge you type it in go to google uh the scientific part and type in just harp and i'm
[1:43:47.400 --> 1:43:52.520]  sure you'll see lots of papers being brought up and uh uh describing the type of work that's done
[1:43:52.520 --> 1:44:00.040]  there and you'll see uh by and large university community is primarily involved with it now harp
[1:44:00.040 --> 1:44:07.240]  is uh several different bases isn't it several different facilities no harp is uh we basically
[1:44:07.240 --> 1:44:14.120]  have a site up in alaska the cone alaska and what you i don't know whether it was the offline that
[1:44:14.120 --> 1:44:21.000]  you mentioned it was originally going to be way back in the uh 70s and 80s there were plans to
[1:44:21.000 --> 1:44:26.360]  to build a air force over the rising radar system up at that facility back in those days
[1:44:27.160 --> 1:44:36.040]  but with the uh change in a strategic situation that that program was dropped in the 90s and
[1:44:36.040 --> 1:44:45.000]  after a lengthy environmental approval process uh the that site became available to us uh before
[1:44:45.000 --> 1:44:53.800]  the uh scientific purposes of building the harp facility um that's as i say up in in the
[1:44:53.800 --> 1:45:03.800]  the cone alaska okay the only location we have but we do have uh diagnostic instruments at various
[1:45:03.800 --> 1:45:11.000]  locations on the ground in alaska photometers uh photometers those are optical type devices that
[1:45:11.000 --> 1:45:19.240]  that uh uh if if you uh if the weather is right so to speak in space a space weather and there's
[1:45:19.240 --> 1:45:26.600]  not uh too much natural uh disturbances going on like a rora is what we call quiet and on those
[1:45:26.600 --> 1:45:35.160]  kind of nights when we send the radio away some harp up we can produce miniature emissions of light
[1:45:35.160 --> 1:45:40.040]  there's somewhat like a aura thing but they're so weak that that if there's any other natural
[1:45:40.040 --> 1:45:44.920]  or going on we wouldn't understand so you you observe those what what are what are magnometers
[1:45:45.560 --> 1:45:53.880]  or magnetometers um those are instruments that uh typically are set out all the world uh to
[1:45:55.400 --> 1:46:01.000]  to measure the earth's magnetic field the geomagnetic field that surrounds the earth uh
[1:46:01.720 --> 1:46:06.600]  and whenever there's like eruptions on the stand like a solar flare or magnetic storms
[1:46:06.600 --> 1:46:13.640]  so you'll see those magnetic field uh components uh vary and jump around and then they'll get quiet
[1:46:13.640 --> 1:46:18.360]  when it's quiet against that's the way to measure these you know the doctor you just brought up
[1:46:18.360 --> 1:46:23.800]  something super interesting though i mean we've only got five minutes there's one at the heart
[1:46:23.800 --> 1:46:28.280]  there's others around the lab oh they're all over the place they're typical are very bad uh
[1:46:28.280 --> 1:46:33.160]  normal scientific instruments understand uh detecting changes in the earth's magnetic field
[1:46:33.160 --> 1:46:36.200]  we've only got five minutes left with you sir and you just brought up something really interesting
[1:46:36.200 --> 1:46:42.040]  i didn't know that so you guys are able to mimic on a smaller scale the aurora borealis
[1:46:42.840 --> 1:46:49.960]  well in a very local region we can produce any light emission that if you want would
[1:46:50.920 --> 1:46:56.920]  be akin to to something like that but if so orders of magnitude is below what nature does
[1:46:56.920 --> 1:47:02.760]  understand why are you why are you taking photos of that we uh we a why are you studying that
[1:47:02.760 --> 1:47:10.440]  sir sir a why are you studying that b um well well what you do there when you when you do some of
[1:47:10.440 --> 1:47:19.000]  those kind of work uh uh by the where those emissions occur what altitude uh what the uh wavelength
[1:47:19.000 --> 1:47:24.680]  with them are you can start to understand the chemical constituents what's the yeah how much
[1:47:24.680 --> 1:47:30.280]  nitrogen what oxygen and what percentage of things like that a various altitude in space
[1:47:30.280 --> 1:47:35.880]  oh that's one way to kind of sort that out but it's a complicated thing so that's like a spectrometer
[1:47:36.520 --> 1:47:41.720]  what i'm saying the spectrometer is kind of the same thing you where you're measuring these
[1:47:41.720 --> 1:47:47.560]  emissions at different optical wavelengths and and and different emissions will occur at different
[1:47:47.560 --> 1:47:53.480]  altitudes for example and it gives you an idea of where the interactions are occurring how they
[1:47:53.480 --> 1:48:00.360]  move around and what what's the relative concentration of some of those amazing if doing stuff there
[1:48:00.360 --> 1:48:07.240]  amazing in closing um the two final questions what causes the aurora borealis and and how
[1:48:07.240 --> 1:48:13.880]  how are the radio waves causing a reaction that mimics that on a small scale okay they are actually
[1:48:13.880 --> 1:48:22.200]  different physical processes with a you know a similar like uh result in the aurora borealis
[1:48:22.200 --> 1:48:28.280]  you're normally dealing with charged particles from the van allen belt and space uh what we call
[1:48:28.280 --> 1:48:34.200]  precipitating into the lower atmosphere they actually come in lower than normal instead of
[1:48:34.200 --> 1:48:39.400]  bouncing out in deep space and allen belts in certain conditions particularly after solar
[1:48:39.400 --> 1:48:45.000]  eruptions or geomagnetic storms they can be channeled further down and they they get down to
[1:48:45.000 --> 1:48:52.200]  about 100 kilometers altitude with where they collide with neutral atoms which are more prevalent
[1:48:52.200 --> 1:48:57.560]  closer to earth and that those collisions produce these uh these emissions is that because the
[1:48:57.560 --> 1:49:04.120]  magnetic field isn't as strong uh at the poles uh no it's strong and it's more vertical and so the
[1:49:04.120 --> 1:49:10.440]  charged particles are able to actually uh somewhat guide it along and oh it's because it is stronger
[1:49:10.440 --> 1:49:14.680]  it sucks a minute and more vertical so they can kind of come down to lower altitudes and when
[1:49:14.680 --> 1:49:20.040]  they get down to where the air is relatively dense relatively speaking how out at 100 kilometers
[1:49:20.040 --> 1:49:26.520]  60 miles up or so that actually will cause the uh charged particles will knock off uh
[1:49:27.240 --> 1:49:32.760]  collide with the neutral particles in in one of the reactions is the emission of of of
[1:49:32.760 --> 1:49:36.440]  light at various wavelengths god here's the last question we've only got two minutes sorry
[1:49:36.440 --> 1:49:39.640]  interrupt you dr rick a talk all day to you with limited time sorry i'm interrupting final
[1:49:39.640 --> 1:49:44.680]  question radio wave does that it's a little different it goes up in a radio wave interacts
[1:49:44.680 --> 1:49:50.120]  with the charged particles and cause them to vibrate and then they bang into neutral particles
[1:49:50.120 --> 1:49:55.400]  and that produces the emission got you so it's a vibrating uh so it's a collision process in
[1:49:55.400 --> 1:49:59.960]  terms of what we're talking about final final final minutes sir gotta ask you this question
[1:49:59.960 --> 1:50:03.800]  uh you brought up health effects locals worrying about it they admit in government reports that
[1:50:03.800 --> 1:50:10.280]  cell towers up closer bad for live that cell phones uh there are there are thousands of
[1:50:10.280 --> 1:50:16.120]  government studies now where they show increases well they're again but you're saying you're not
[1:50:16.120 --> 1:50:19.960]  worried about your health but i mean with radio transmitters you don't want to go sit on top of
[1:50:19.960 --> 1:50:24.920]  right our dish or sit in there with the transmitters that would be bad for you right well i think one
[1:50:24.920 --> 1:50:30.680]  would be prudent uh if you know if you're uh something was vibrating in your car you wouldn't
[1:50:30.680 --> 1:50:36.600]  want to sit on it too long but uh no i think those kind of questions are up being studied
[1:50:36.600 --> 1:50:42.440]  by the appropriate organizations and people and and uh what you're saying you feel safe working
[1:50:42.440 --> 1:50:49.960]  up there and oh yeah in fact uh again the fields that we encounter the relatives are so weak compared
[1:50:49.960 --> 1:50:57.240]  to to what's just naturally around us that they say we're puny now the facility looks big i mean
[1:50:57.240 --> 1:51:02.920]  it's impressive in terms of the number of antennas in that but that's just the nature of the technology
[1:51:02.920 --> 1:51:09.240]  to be able to get a signal that we can measure hundreds of miles up uh that signal by the time
[1:51:09.240 --> 1:51:14.520]  it leaves the ground and gets out there it's so weak that uh you know it really has a hard time
[1:51:14.520 --> 1:51:19.400]  competing with natural okay uh doctor i want to thank you i want to thank the air force base for
[1:51:19.400 --> 1:51:23.960]  having you on dr paul cosy just google hard if you can find the air force site there at kirkland
[1:51:23.960 --> 1:51:28.280]  thank you for the time sir okay thank you thank you let me say bye to you during the break
[1:51:29.800 --> 1:51:35.080]  you ever have one of those days where everything goes right first i get the best parking space at

[1:54:39.560 --> 1:54:52.760]  you know i'm making a new film called black sunshine about the murder of jfk
[1:54:55.640 --> 1:54:59.880]  and the lady who makes big hollywood posters just sent me a black sunshine poster she made
[1:55:00.520 --> 1:55:04.200]  you look something better than what you'd see for like independence day or star wars
[1:55:04.200 --> 1:55:12.040]  come on unbelievable talent and we got a great cover for truth rising but we have a new cover
[1:55:12.040 --> 1:55:17.320]  out when the first uh ten thousand or so gets sold because i want to put this lady's cover out
[1:55:17.320 --> 1:55:26.120]  unbelievable unbelievable we're going to email her back and thank her for it and and post it
[1:55:26.120 --> 1:55:33.560]  on the web as people can see it just absolutely amazing marty digressing off into other issues
[1:55:33.560 --> 1:55:39.880]  here but uh i just saw it during the break and couldn't contain myself the problem is i want to
[1:55:39.880 --> 1:55:43.720]  churn this black sunshine out but it's such an important film i want to take my time now
[1:55:43.720 --> 1:55:49.800]  but i promise he um st john hunt eard hunt son and jim marge and others i get it out quicker
[1:55:51.240 --> 1:55:58.360]  but um i'm just doing so much i'm going in so many different directions yeah tray set up the heart
[1:55:58.360 --> 1:56:04.760]  people when i got back in town late last week and he said i told me friday i've set up the director
[1:56:04.760 --> 1:56:09.320]  of harp and i'm like what you should have heard it behind the scenes though they had this pr guy
[1:56:09.320 --> 1:56:14.760]  on the line with him the whole time that's why his phone sounded muffled and they put off this whole
[1:56:14.760 --> 1:56:24.120]  you know persona it's no big deal it's all above board and i have no doubt that a lot of it is
[1:56:24.120 --> 1:56:29.160]  exaggerated what you hear on the web or or or they they combine other programs in with it
[1:56:29.160 --> 1:56:33.640]  because there's hundreds of different programs fiddling with the atmosphere and you know all
[1:56:33.640 --> 1:56:39.240]  these radio waves aren't doing anything but we can make aurora borealis with them which is exactly
[1:56:39.240 --> 1:56:43.480]  what the scientists we've had on say that the technology they test and develop there is then
[1:56:43.480 --> 1:56:47.640]  farmed out in other programs and i'm sure that the head of harp doesn't even know about those other
[1:56:47.640 --> 1:56:52.360]  programs that's how general stubble bind was the head of special forces head of army intelligence
[1:56:52.360 --> 1:56:57.720]  and he didn't know most of what was going on in other departments but dr paul cosy they were
[1:56:58.760 --> 1:57:03.640]  really begging me to come up to harp i was joking with him saying yes you can replace
[1:57:03.640 --> 1:57:11.560]  me with an alien clone or something oh god help us you know the world's in a lot of
[1:57:11.560 --> 1:57:16.520]  deep trouble when having a discussion with the director of harp is light talk light discussion
[1:57:16.520 --> 1:57:27.080]  but uh you notice i brought up well cell towers and cell phones are known to give you cancer
[1:57:27.080 --> 1:57:33.960]  he's like who who says that what ridiculous just thousands of government reports totally admitted
[1:57:33.960 --> 1:57:38.840]  not debatable the cell phone companies are saying use a hands-free uh the cell phones are putting
[1:57:38.840 --> 1:57:44.360]  out now ratings saying we have the lowest you know uh microwave radiation emission
[1:57:44.360 --> 1:57:52.040]  let's say the razor has the lowest working in radio working around engineers you know they
[1:57:52.040 --> 1:57:56.680]  have it in a separate building you don't want to be around the transmitter on an am or fm if it's
[1:57:56.680 --> 1:58:02.200]  a big not a little one but if it's a five thousand watt ten thousand one hundred fifty thousand one
[1:58:02.200 --> 1:58:07.880]  hundred thousand watt am or fm transmitter you don't want to be anywhere near it it'll burn you
[1:58:08.440 --> 1:58:13.320]  the radar dishes will burn you i mean everybody knows that that's admitted he was like well maybe
[1:58:13.320 --> 1:58:21.240]  there might be something who have the proper authorities are looking into that now the way
[1:58:21.240 --> 1:58:25.400]  talking to radio engineers radio science engineers is that if you have an antenna say a hundred feet
[1:58:25.400 --> 1:58:32.360]  long for a hundred feet out from it it's putting fry you energy out and then it cuts off by half
[1:58:32.360 --> 1:58:36.760]  at a hundred feet and then another hundred feet it cuts down by half so a thousand feet out or
[1:58:36.760 --> 1:58:44.200]  something you've got a ten fold reduction in the power of that wave the problem is there's
[1:58:44.200 --> 1:58:49.880]  so many antennas so many things all around us and it's not the natural waves that we are accustomed
[1:58:49.880 --> 1:58:53.640]  to and that we're designed for and that even govern our sleep patterns and there's major
[1:58:53.640 --> 1:59:01.960]  studies on that so there was a lot of bs going on during that interview i'll uh say that but hey
[1:59:01.960 --> 1:59:06.440]  you got the interview who else gets you the director of heart we'll be right back stay with us
[1:59:11.960 --> 1:59:16.920]  thank you for listening to gcn be sure to visit gcnlive.com today
[1:59:20.040 --> 1:59:28.440]  it is a big idea a new world order in the near future earth is dominated by a powerful world
[1:59:28.440 --> 1:59:35.560]  government it's known as the builder bird but they're objective the world domination for thousands
[1:59:35.560 --> 1:59:42.200]  of years their dark order grew now as they hail the birth of the new world order their great dream
[1:59:42.200 --> 1:59:45.480]  of exterminating 80 percent of humanity is at hand
[1:59:48.360 --> 1:59:54.120]  for the first time in history the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open you will

[1:59:58.440 --> 2:00:02.600]  they're not after money they have all the money they need they're after power that's their aptitude

[2:00:30.920 --> 2:00:38.280]  big brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[2:00:38.280 --> 2:00:55.560]  he's alex joneshield on the gcn radio network and now live from austin texas alex joneshield
[2:00:55.560 --> 2:01:11.240]  welcome back ladies and gentlemen i've got a little guest popping in the next segment
[2:01:12.520 --> 2:01:16.760]  then we're here with bated breath waiting for the second amendment announcement as if we don't
[2:01:16.760 --> 2:01:24.600]  know what it's going to be just finishing up with a harp interview he was trying to deny
[2:01:24.600 --> 2:01:31.960]  weather modification weather control and i could tell he was really trying to restrict what he said
[2:01:34.440 --> 2:01:39.880]  and he did have a guy on the phone the whole time with him the pr guy saying i'm not going on air
[2:01:39.880 --> 2:01:44.280]  i'm just making sure all this goes correctly they're ready to disconnect him at any moment
[2:01:45.240 --> 2:01:49.560]  and for some reason they didn't have uh dr ed kennedy on his colleague
[2:01:49.560 --> 2:01:57.640]  big or the other guy from the navel end of all this i'm done talking about it tray set it up and
[2:01:59.400 --> 2:02:07.080]  we bring on the quote other side and for other hosts that are going to flip out now and say that
[2:02:07.640 --> 2:02:12.920]  we're in league with harp because we were able to get them on you can call the pr people
[2:02:13.880 --> 2:02:17.720]  and if you're willing to make 10 phone calls like tray does you might be able to get them on
[2:02:17.720 --> 2:02:22.760]  but it's kind of like catching a fish i had him up to the boat and it fell out of the boat but the
[2:02:22.760 --> 2:02:27.240]  line stayed in its mouth and then i had to i was about to catch three fish and i drug one in
[2:02:29.480 --> 2:02:34.200]  the incredible ignorance out there it's like when i had roth child on people were going look at him
[2:02:34.200 --> 2:02:40.360]  he had roth child on he's in league with him no roth child put out a children's book brainwashing
[2:02:40.360 --> 2:02:46.600]  the children to hate themselves and accept you know carbon taxes and uh with a stupid polar bear
[2:02:46.600 --> 2:02:53.080]  drowning on the front of it and so we called his publisher and snuck attack him and i'm not going
[2:02:53.080 --> 2:02:59.000]  to tell you our trade secrets but we actually it's a bit disingenuous how we get these people on
[2:02:59.640 --> 2:03:06.680]  now we with the government we didn't uh abscond then we didn't divert them because we know they
[2:03:06.680 --> 2:03:11.640]  can find out we just said yeah it's alex shows and we wanted to have them on and so that's why
[2:03:11.640 --> 2:03:15.480]  they were going come on alex we don't have space aliens up here during the breaks come on come
[2:03:15.480 --> 2:03:21.400]  up here and see it's really no big deal then he tried to deny that parton was involved and they
[2:03:21.400 --> 2:03:25.880]  did some checking you heard during a break and came back and okay there was a program in the 80s
[2:03:26.520 --> 2:03:31.000]  see because they know that's gonna the pr guy was constantly in his ear the whole time
[2:03:31.960 --> 2:03:35.560]  on another channel and then i'd hear him during the breaks talking oh hold on i've got that unmuted
[2:03:35.560 --> 2:03:40.040]  where they can hear let me talk to you now click they'd be gone and then have their little discussions
[2:03:40.040 --> 2:03:47.160]  what a bizarre job i've got i mean it is just so bizarre
[2:03:49.720 --> 2:03:54.440]  but i would like to hear better guests on other shows and all other shows get jealous and upset
[2:03:54.440 --> 2:03:59.400]  about how good our guests are why we're all on the same team find the new order here uh
[2:04:00.680 --> 2:04:05.160]  you can do that too if you actually work your butts off you can get all the big guests too
[2:04:05.160 --> 2:04:11.560]  well i got tray working on a whole bunch of important guests right now for this week
[2:04:11.560 --> 2:04:17.320]  and next week just every time i tell you it pans out lord willow and we got some big guests this
[2:04:17.320 --> 2:04:25.240]  week big guests next week huge guests coming up next month later in the month we've had some
[2:04:25.240 --> 2:04:29.400]  mega huge fish that have contacted us that we had right up to the boat in the info war
[2:04:29.400 --> 2:04:35.960]  and uh who then got spooked and didn't do it you wouldn't believe the people that have
[2:04:35.960 --> 2:04:41.000]  contacted me in the last few years and our fans of the show what we do who it would send shock waves
[2:04:41.000 --> 2:04:46.200]  if they came on the show but they check it out that's why you've got to appreciate the courage
[2:04:47.000 --> 2:04:53.400]  of a george carlin charlie sheen a german defense minister andres farmulo an italian president
[2:04:53.400 --> 2:05:02.200]  a governor vintera a ray mcgovern cia a bill christianson cia did you hear mcgovern without me
[2:05:02.200 --> 2:05:06.520]  pushing him he was seeing the government with stage terror attacks this is the guy that brief
[2:05:06.520 --> 2:05:12.840]  ronald reagan and george bush senior you understand this stuff is real this stuff is happening this
[2:05:12.840 --> 2:05:20.040]  stuff is going on tons of news on the attack on the internet huge new taxes control police state

[2:08:57.480 --> 2:09:10.040]  just had the director of heart on putting out a lot of bit of baloney you can look at that two
[2:09:10.040 --> 2:09:24.360]  ways they're trying to be deceptive or they are very very nervous and are afraid of what the
[2:09:24.360 --> 2:09:29.240]  public thinks of them you know in the past they would not come on and do pr pieces on my show
[2:09:29.240 --> 2:09:33.160]  or really any other show but they're doing more and more of that because the government realizes
[2:09:33.160 --> 2:09:41.880]  they're losing so much credibility but we will talk more about that we're all waiting with
[2:09:41.880 --> 2:09:47.320]  baited breath for the second amendment ruling they ruled on it months ago in secret it's how the
[2:09:47.320 --> 2:09:55.320]  supreme court works then they went to their spring recess they had a closed door meeting
[2:09:56.360 --> 2:10:02.520]  supposedly to give oral statements if they wish many times especially clarence thomas doesn't
[2:10:02.520 --> 2:10:11.240]  choose to give a oral statement or comment on why he ruled away some of the justices always rule
[2:10:11.240 --> 2:10:18.600]  others rule some of the time the point is they met yesterday and were supposedly going to release
[2:10:18.600 --> 2:10:25.240]  their rulings and i've been on their website as of about 30 minutes ago i'm on there right now
[2:10:27.080 --> 2:10:32.280]  and i'm not seeing ruling on the second amendment this is very ominous and i shut up larry pratt and
[2:10:32.280 --> 2:10:40.840]  erin zellman coming up in about 50 minutes to try to comment on whatever the ruling was
[2:10:40.840 --> 2:10:48.040]  today and it hasn't happened yet in fact i can't radio broadcast and google at the same time hey erin
[2:10:48.760 --> 2:10:54.520]  do a google news search under second amendment supreme court ruling or supreme court rulings
[2:10:54.520 --> 2:11:00.440]  released and and because it's going to come out any minute i mean it's sometimes they do announce
[2:11:00.440 --> 2:11:06.440]  the day after in a few rare cases like a week later this is bizarre i mean we need to find out now
[2:11:06.440 --> 2:11:13.640]  and we'll continue to watch this for the next two hours while we're live and cover that for you i
[2:11:13.640 --> 2:11:20.520]  got a bunch of other financial news military news taxation news internet news very important coming
[2:11:20.520 --> 2:11:27.720]  up but also what's important to this show is our sponsors we can't bring you this radio show without
[2:11:27.720 --> 2:11:33.880]  our sponsors this show wouldn't exist i mean i have a small organization of 15 people i'm about
[2:11:33.880 --> 2:11:39.080]  to expand to probably 20 but when you have a small number of people it's hard to expand
[2:11:39.080 --> 2:11:43.400]  because you're so busy tied down with your other workload i'm not complaining i'm saying we are
[2:11:43.400 --> 2:11:48.440]  trying to go to the next level we have a warehouse we just signed a lease on three weeks ago and we're
[2:11:48.440 --> 2:11:52.760]  moving into that they're building a new wall partitioning some areas so we can have offices
[2:11:53.640 --> 2:11:58.520]  we're trying to start a tv show then tv network there'll be a lot of opportunities soon please
[2:11:58.520 --> 2:12:03.640]  don't come bang on our office door i want the job now send in resumes whether it's in video internet
[2:12:05.240 --> 2:12:11.800]  sales we're going to have room for a lot of people i say five people but interns or people
[2:12:11.800 --> 2:12:17.800]  that want to have test runs with us the thing is this is not a social party time here a lot of
[2:12:17.800 --> 2:12:22.520]  other patriot groups and folks it's a big social deal this is work this is grueling work this is
[2:12:23.400 --> 2:12:27.880]  this is focused work this is not a game this is the big leagues in the fight against the
[2:12:27.880 --> 2:12:33.720]  new world order but that said we couldn't have done this without our sponsors and one of our
[2:12:33.720 --> 2:12:44.040]  oldest sponsors is marty the soap man and i've told you the story it's great organic soap it's
[2:12:44.040 --> 2:12:50.600]  been around 58 years since 1947 he started it when he got out of the chemical weapons corps
[2:12:50.600 --> 2:12:57.160]  in world war two and with his daddy now his son and their son work there in oakland california
[2:12:57.720 --> 2:13:04.040]  because it's directly from them you get it 85 off and i learned about this soap word of mouth
[2:13:04.040 --> 2:13:08.680]  and used him for a year before i thought to get him as a sponsor that was when i first started
[2:13:08.680 --> 2:13:13.480]  getting sponsors before that i was literally three people and all i did was sell my videos and
[2:13:13.480 --> 2:13:19.240]  could barely operate and i'm really proud of marty and the fine product he's got but the reason
[2:13:19.240 --> 2:13:23.640]  it's so important that he worked for the chemical weapons corps is that that's why they freaked out
[2:13:23.640 --> 2:13:27.320]  and looked at the ingredients of how they were getting rid of soap when he came back from world
[2:13:27.320 --> 2:13:33.320]  war two and we're moving into detergents and chemicals the oil companies took over the soap
[2:13:33.320 --> 2:13:40.360]  industry so really he's just old-fashioned soap it's it's vegetable and and and fruit the essence
[2:13:40.360 --> 2:13:45.800]  of cherry and almond and and you save 85 off and it's something you can do to hurt the new world
[2:13:45.800 --> 2:13:51.080]  order is to move over to it marty it is always wonderful to have you on once a month with us
[2:13:51.080 --> 2:13:57.400]  and it's just great to be part of your fine your fine products success story thank you alex i
[2:13:57.400 --> 2:14:04.520]  appreciate that very much and i want to take care of your listeners and my number for today is 365

[2:14:26.120 --> 2:14:35.400]  supermarket 17 to 21 cents of that dollar goes for cleaning chemicals and that amounts to almost
[2:14:35.400 --> 2:14:42.840]  20 a week out of your grocery store bill that's 80 a month that's almost a thousand dollars
[2:14:42.840 --> 2:14:50.200]  a year going down to drain with nothing to show for it well we counter that how about
[2:14:50.200 --> 2:14:58.440]  15 dollars a month for everything delivered including shipping taxes whatever including
[2:14:58.440 --> 2:15:06.760]  consultation on all your cleaning problems we take care of you we have an exclusive for alex

[2:15:13.960 --> 2:15:24.760]  about 180 to 190 dollars per year and that breaks down to three dollars and 65 cents a week can't
[2:15:24.760 --> 2:15:31.640]  beat it i know you're going to say ah it's too good to be true it's good and it's true i couldn't
[2:15:31.640 --> 2:15:38.760]  be here i tell you that well no it was true i don't believe in extreme exaggerations well marty
[2:15:38.760 --> 2:15:45.720]  the people perish for lack of knowledge and they will pay 85 percent more for toxic sludge
[2:15:46.360 --> 2:15:52.920]  that in hundreds of studies in their own admissions are causing asthma allergies and look in my own
[2:15:52.920 --> 2:15:58.680]  family if we run out of your soap or one of the other organic soaps we use my wife still buys
[2:15:58.680 --> 2:16:04.600]  some stuff at the Whole Foods that by the way costs three times what the inorganic costs when you
[2:16:04.600 --> 2:16:10.680]  are 85 percent less than inorganic i mean it's usually pay more for organic you pay less with
[2:16:10.680 --> 2:16:18.200]  marty but anytime we're on vacation or at family's house like clockwork with my son especially and
[2:16:18.200 --> 2:16:23.480]  i was the same when i was a child if somebody washes his clothes and tied or in one of those
[2:16:23.480 --> 2:16:28.680]  other ones he gets rashes all over uh you know we'll be driving down the road two hours after he
[2:16:28.680 --> 2:16:33.000]  gets dressed in the morning and he'll be daddy it hurts it hurts my bottom hurts my leg hurts
[2:16:33.000 --> 2:16:39.800]  and he'll have a rash on his back on his on his hind end from the stuff that's in the regular
[2:16:39.800 --> 2:16:46.120]  detergents why is that marty well you what you didn't include was that tied spelled backwards
[2:16:46.120 --> 2:16:53.000]  is eat it and it does that to the skin it does that to the clothing it's stronger than dirt
[2:16:53.000 --> 2:17:00.200]  that's what they advertise all over the dirt it's too strong it deteriorates the fabric of the clothing
[2:17:00.200 --> 2:17:08.600]  lint is broken clothing from the detergents they make it strong so it strips the soil deteriorates
[2:17:08.600 --> 2:17:15.560]  the soil it also harms your skin your clothing your washing machine everything it comes in contact
[2:17:15.560 --> 2:17:22.040]  with and is controlled by proctor and gamble the largest chemical manufacturer in the world
[2:17:22.040 --> 2:17:30.280]  they did last year fifty billion dollars worth of business that's b billion they spent ten percent
[2:17:30.280 --> 2:17:38.360]  of that five billion dollars on tv advertising billboards newspapers magazines to promote the
[2:17:38.360 --> 2:17:45.320]  consumer to hypnotize the consumer to have them believe that this is the end for cleaning and
[2:17:45.320 --> 2:17:50.200]  these ads are so ridiculous it's like a woman will be depressed and it's a dark dusty day and
[2:17:50.200 --> 2:17:56.520]  then as soon as she opens the tide package flowers shoot out and life's wonderful and it's ridiculous
[2:17:56.520 --> 2:18:03.480]  well with the perfumes in there to smell beautiful perfumes are toxic perfumes burn the skin
[2:18:03.480 --> 2:18:10.200]  who needs it you have a choice now and this is what we feel an american choice of getting back

[2:18:20.600 --> 2:18:27.640]  and vegetable oils and not waste petroleum and that sodium chloride and not perfumes and all

[2:25:05.720 --> 2:25:10.520]  and sponsors i think are great values and i believe you should filter your water i believe
[2:25:10.520 --> 2:25:15.960]  you should try to save money and be healthier by having non-detergent non-petrochemical
[2:25:16.840 --> 2:25:23.560]  cleaning products and shampoos and lotions and bar soap i think you should own firearms for your
[2:25:23.560 --> 2:25:28.920]  protection though we don't have any second amendment sponsors we should i believe in
[2:25:28.920 --> 2:25:33.800]  preparedness we do have great sponsors on that end i believe in precious metals evidence by look
[2:25:33.800 --> 2:25:40.200]  at the rise in their price the last three years more than doubling and i believe in freedom and
[2:25:40.200 --> 2:25:46.840]  liberty and i believe in marty the soap man marty again great having you on with us just

[2:26:18.840 --> 2:26:26.680]  their phone system yeah 1-800-340-7091 ought to have marty it was just a regular guess sometime
[2:26:26.680 --> 2:26:34.760]  to really talk about what is in the detergents you shouldn't call them soaps
[2:26:37.080 --> 2:26:41.880]  and then just the fact that in most these products half of its salt sometimes more
[2:26:43.400 --> 2:26:48.920]  it's just filler it's just a total scam marty i wanted to get a limerick from you my friend

[2:27:57.640 --> 2:28:02.040]  bunch of news i was just thinking about how amazing life is i know i say this every day but
[2:28:02.760 --> 2:28:08.680]  in different ways it's just so incredible and all the amazing humans that have lived before us
[2:28:08.680 --> 2:28:13.720]  the good the bad and the ugly the creations the things we've made the things we've built
[2:28:13.720 --> 2:28:21.880]  the poetry the ideas the quotes uh the i feel like i know these poets and philosophers
[2:28:21.880 --> 2:28:27.240]  and people some of my read thousands of years ago some of them dead for thousands of years some of
[2:28:27.240 --> 2:28:33.320]  them whose bones are dust some of them who died just a few days ago you know i got a few criticism
[2:28:33.320 --> 2:28:37.560]  emails when i said i like george carlin i said i agree with about 90 percent of what he had to say
[2:28:38.440 --> 2:28:42.920]  i didn't agree with george carlin cynically not believing there's a god because he couldn't see it
[2:28:42.920 --> 2:28:49.240]  i don't uh but at the same time i'm not a big judge i think overall he was a good person
[2:28:50.440 --> 2:28:57.560]  he was a rebel and i'm sad that he was so cynical and so worldly that he could never
[2:28:58.840 --> 2:29:02.920]  experience other things in life that some of us have experienced that he has an experience like
[2:29:02.920 --> 2:29:08.920]  deniz kasinich waxing religious or no one didn't say religious spiritual here saying he doesn't
[2:29:08.920 --> 2:29:16.440]  care if they kill him during the break he said even more to me but uh saying that because he's
[2:29:16.440 --> 2:29:22.280]  committed it's a spiritual fight it's a spiritual journey deniz kasinich it used to be like that
[2:29:22.280 --> 2:29:25.880]  but but fighting evil will bring you to another level i don't know how to explain it to people
[2:29:28.440 --> 2:29:33.720]  i mean i still am a complete joke i mean i'm an idiot i'm a big mouth i'm a crash
[2:29:33.720 --> 2:29:41.560]  blaggard half the time but i'm growing and and i could see myself growing and and my love increasing
[2:29:41.560 --> 2:29:50.200]  and my intellect increasing and my wisdom increasing and i i and i know that my life will be over
[2:29:50.200 --> 2:29:55.800]  before i know it it just goes by so quickly it's like waiting in a bus stop and you're waiting 30
[2:29:55.800 --> 2:30:00.680]  minutes you think it'll never come and then sure enough you start daydreaming and looking at the
[2:30:00.680 --> 2:30:03.960]  blue birds in the trees and here comes the bus pulling up well that's your death folks
[2:30:06.280 --> 2:30:11.560]  so make sure that you leave stuff behind that's good because that's how you live forever you live

[2:35:27.880 --> 2:35:33.880]  amendment means to you ideas you've got to wake up conservatives that the that the second amendment
[2:35:33.880 --> 2:35:39.320]  is under the greatest attack ever sustained like every other section of the bill of rights
[2:35:39.960 --> 2:35:44.120]  i want to hear from you next hour in fact i'm i'll even take some calls on the second amendment

[2:35:55.160 --> 2:36:02.520]  with any other subjects you want but next hour i'm only taking calls uh on the subject uh of
[2:36:02.520 --> 2:36:08.360]  the attack on our right to defend ourselves our right to protect ourselves the surest sign
[2:36:08.360 --> 2:36:13.560]  that you're living in a despotism you're living in a tyranny you're living in a society run by crooks
[2:36:13.560 --> 2:36:20.280]  is when they come after your guns okay let's uh go over the news here bolton says israel will attack
[2:36:20.280 --> 2:36:26.520]  iran before next president sworn in speaking to london telegraph john bolton a former united
[2:36:26.520 --> 2:36:32.520]  united nations weapons ambassador appointed by president bush has predicted the state of israel
[2:36:32.520 --> 2:36:38.040]  attack iran's nuclear sites before the next u.s president has sworn in a bunch of other officials
[2:36:38.040 --> 2:36:41.480]  and former officials are saying the same thing they're saying it's probably going to be after
[2:36:41.480 --> 2:36:48.520]  barack obama is elected it's a threat they say if you don't elect mccain we're going to attack it's
[2:36:48.520 --> 2:36:55.400]  bizarre as if barack obama isn't a warmonger uh in an interview with the uk's telegraph bolton said
[2:36:55.400 --> 2:37:01.800]  the arab world would be pleased at news of such an attack well that's kind of true the wahhabi
[2:37:01.800 --> 2:37:09.400]  istalkaida out of i saudi arabia will be pleased with an attack on the shiites uh in in the reaction
[2:37:09.400 --> 2:37:15.320]  will be positive privately he added i think there will be public denunciations but no action however
[2:37:15.320 --> 2:37:21.400]  bolton pan the idea that an attack on iran would be carried out by american forces stating the
[2:37:21.400 --> 2:37:26.280]  administration has essentially given up the possibility they know full well that if iran gets
[2:37:26.280 --> 2:37:32.200]  hit they've already put up with terror attacks and stage u.s special forces ops and al-qaeda attacks
[2:37:32.920 --> 2:37:37.640]  that's right run by our criminal government don't roll your eyes good old boy the white house admits
[2:37:37.640 --> 2:37:42.280]  it god you're incredible i know they're out there everywhere denying it that's ridiculous we found
[2:37:42.280 --> 2:37:50.840]  al-qaeda they think you're so dumb they run al-qaeda publicly i just had ronald reagan and george
[2:37:50.840 --> 2:37:56.360]  bush's chief advisor on and he was telling you know i brought that up he said yeah our government
[2:37:56.360 --> 2:38:02.120]  runs al-qaeda in texas iran you understand that and you get that through your pea brain it's real
[2:38:02.120 --> 2:38:08.600]  simple they treat you like a complete idiot stop letting them treat us like idiots this is dangerous
[2:38:10.120 --> 2:38:15.960]  they may carry out another al-qaeda front attack any day in this country or in europe or in israel
[2:38:15.960 --> 2:38:24.600]  all the big rich jews are running out of israel all of them they're the richest guy left a few
[2:38:24.600 --> 2:38:30.680]  months ago they're selling their houses they're leaving i think that's a major sign that they're
[2:38:30.680 --> 2:38:37.960]  going to blow the daylights out of israel oh god help us world war three will then start
[2:38:37.960 --> 2:38:46.680]  uh can't all of you see what we're on the edge of
[2:38:46.680 --> 2:38:50.440]  i said i'd cover all the news and i've just been five minutes on one article it's just too insane
[2:38:51.720 --> 2:38:57.160]  okay that's bolton we got corporate media loathe to explain real outrage behind terror comments
[2:38:57.160 --> 2:39:03.080]  press fails to point out track record of neocons contracting for attacks the media circus surrounding
[2:39:03.080 --> 2:39:08.200]  mccain advisor charlie blacks statement that another terror attack would be a big advantage
[2:39:08.200 --> 2:39:13.320]  in the election contest is completely failed to explain why such comments are so disturbing
[2:39:15.160 --> 2:39:24.920]  we've had governors republican party heads state heads syndicated columnist op ed writers dick cheney
[2:39:24.920 --> 2:39:34.360]  uh donald rumsfeld and tape saying how wonderful more attacks would be and how we need more attacks
[2:39:34.360 --> 2:39:38.840]  and they wrote peanut documents before the attack saying it's sure help them get their new world order
[2:39:38.840 --> 2:39:45.880]  in they did it they write letters to iran the head of the cfr board that gave us the homeland
[2:39:45.880 --> 2:39:52.440]  security system gary hart it's bipartisan newt genrich is on the same committee wrote and said
[2:39:52.440 --> 2:39:59.240]  we stage terror attacks you better do what we say don't think the american people are against the war
[2:39:59.240 --> 2:40:03.640]  that we can't stage an attack and that they won't go along with it then we went and asked gary hart
[2:40:03.640 --> 2:40:08.760]  about his letter and he said yeah i wrote it and it's our government may stage an event there's no
[2:40:08.760 --> 2:40:16.840]  debating it they think you're so dumb that they i have predicted that rush limbaugh would endorse
[2:40:16.840 --> 2:40:22.680]  hillary clinton five years before it happened it happened i mean i predicted a lot of stuff
[2:40:22.680 --> 2:40:29.880]  and you think it sounds crazy when i predicted the way they're going if it continues i predict
[2:40:29.880 --> 2:40:34.280]  they may come right out and basically say we carried out the attacks but it was for your own good
[2:40:37.880 --> 2:40:43.160]  i've already had special ops people email me on the street and stuff go yeah so what maybe we did it
[2:40:43.160 --> 2:40:47.480]  you got it the people are wimps we got to get a motivated to fight the muslim threat i mean
[2:40:48.440 --> 2:40:52.040]  they know we know they did it now so they're kind of just going well we did it for your own good
[2:40:52.040 --> 2:40:59.400]  you murdering bastards and and we put out the trailer for truth rising that's mainly about
[2:40:59.400 --> 2:41:04.440]  the first responders which is about a third of the film the main message is get them treatment
[2:41:04.440 --> 2:41:16.840]  the police environment and i got emails and and and message post and and youtube post in the comments
[2:41:17.640 --> 2:41:22.360]  where it's confirmed to be them it's their handle it's their link to their page and they are marines
[2:41:22.360 --> 2:41:28.440]  they are army and they're saying we're gonna kill you mr jones for this for making this film we are
[2:41:28.440 --> 2:41:37.080]  going to kill you for saying get our police environment and emergency workers treatment
[2:41:37.080 --> 2:41:48.120]  that's how evil their cadres are why i'm the bad guy i am bad we are the bad guys you understand
[2:41:48.120 --> 2:41:55.720]  that a lot of these guys know the attack was an inside job they like it folks these are sick
[2:41:55.720 --> 2:42:06.680]  sick sick sick sick sick sick people you understand our government for 50 years has been training
[2:42:06.680 --> 2:42:13.000]  death squads in raping and torturing children in front of their parents it's all declassified
[2:42:13.640 --> 2:42:18.520]  and i demand that those of you that support this system stop denying it to yourself what you're
[2:42:18.520 --> 2:42:24.360]  part of and you look in the mirror and you decide you work for the system you empower the system
[2:42:24.360 --> 2:42:30.840]  you protect the system and i don't mean from violence you protect it by cancel canceling our
[2:42:30.840 --> 2:42:38.920]  websites shutting down our sites going after us threatening us suing us confiscating our cameras

[2:43:29.400 --> 2:43:35.080]  little goblin and the little creature the little cat kind of like in the loony tunes where you'll
[2:43:35.080 --> 2:43:39.160]  have the kitten scaring the mouse the kitten and the mouse are fighting and the mouse is beating
[2:43:39.160 --> 2:43:44.520]  the kitten up and then the mouse suddenly is terrified and then the kitten feels real powerful
[2:43:44.520 --> 2:43:49.640]  and rises up and says oh now you're scared but right behind the kitten is their mama the big
[2:43:49.640 --> 2:43:55.640]  giant one with teeth or you know they they've got lots of cartoons like that where it's a baby grizzly
[2:43:55.640 --> 2:44:01.000]  bear fighting with some other animal and it's losing and then the other animal runs off scared
[2:44:01.000 --> 2:44:07.080]  and the baby grizzly bear feels tough and doesn't realize it's mama's behind it you think we're scared
[2:44:07.080 --> 2:44:12.120]  of you and you're on bestial low level power trips because you wear black uniforms get to intimidate

[2:44:54.520 --> 2:45:01.160]  the size of the manhattan project in funding and scope the entire global government our
[2:45:01.160 --> 2:45:07.720]  entire government everything they do is to carry out your organized sterilization your organized
[2:45:07.720 --> 2:45:15.720]  murder and you laugh and you giggle in your own little suppressive culture and oh listen to these
[2:45:15.720 --> 2:45:19.800]  nuts listen to these coops look at what they're saying now but everything we talked about is true
[2:45:21.160 --> 2:45:28.680]  recruiting 26 000 preachers to covertly have them go teach government sermons about submitting
[2:45:28.680 --> 2:45:35.080]  to government and taking forced inoculations and going to labor camps and teaching flocks to accept
[2:45:35.080 --> 2:45:45.880]  their families being broken up cops coming up and taking people's video cameras
[2:45:47.800 --> 2:45:52.680]  ordering the slaves around saying there's no right to demonstrate i mean you're the bad guys
[2:45:52.680 --> 2:45:59.880]  period period and don't give me that crap that you do all this because al-qaeda
[2:46:02.360 --> 2:46:10.200]  give me a break give me a break i remember three years ago four it was almost four years ago we
[2:46:10.200 --> 2:46:14.440]  got the republican strategy memo about about how they wanted a tax and how great a tax would be and
[2:46:14.440 --> 2:46:22.200]  how they really needed them you said it wasn't real we read public peanut documents that are
[2:46:22.200 --> 2:46:27.400]  public publicly published by the think tanks saying giant terror attacks are what they need for
[2:46:27.400 --> 2:46:36.040]  their new world war and they need them fast you said that isn't real you deny reality when it's in
[2:46:36.040 --> 2:46:43.880]  your face i can't tell you how many government bureaucrats and people that serve the system
[2:46:43.880 --> 2:46:49.080]  that laughed at me and then years later they sent me emails going oh my god oh my god i took my
[2:46:49.080 --> 2:46:55.160]  eighteen month old in they got their next round of shots and he had a seizure that night oh my god

[2:47:14.840 --> 2:47:18.440]  i used to listen to you 10 years ago and then i became a detective and i found out my department
[2:47:18.440 --> 2:47:28.120]  is dealing drugs my god this stuff's real but more often than not you decide to go ahead and deal
[2:47:28.120 --> 2:47:38.040]  the drugs and make excuses about why you deal them it's disgusting i'm pontificating
[2:47:42.280 --> 2:47:46.120]  they now publicly come on tv and say we sure need terror attacks they sure do help us
[2:47:46.120 --> 2:47:49.160]  us and then people ask me why would the government stage an attack
[2:47:50.360 --> 2:47:52.840]  hmm they're telling you why it would help them
[2:47:58.360 --> 2:48:01.960]  an age says it was a plot to kill harkman energy to the us and israel tried to kill him
[2:48:02.520 --> 2:48:11.000]  in bagdad and in roam israel is exercising for nuclear disaster with iran roiders and yahu
[2:48:11.000 --> 2:48:15.400]  the new york times reported friday that israel carried out a major military strikes this month
[2:48:15.400 --> 2:48:22.920]  exercises month described by unnamed american officials as a rehearsal for mayhem i a powerful
[2:48:22.920 --> 2:48:29.560]  attack on iran's nuclear uranium enrichment plant and they're preparing for all out war
[2:48:29.560 --> 2:48:39.160]  and counter attacks and everything else there's big dis info stories uh in the ap something fishy
[2:48:39.160 --> 2:48:45.960]  experts say gas prices should be two dollars a gallon not four
[2:48:47.800 --> 2:48:54.280]  and then they go into some quotes by government people blaming it on speculators it has nothing
[2:48:54.280 --> 2:49:01.640]  to do with that and i find no adults i find no one on financial shows but you talk to financial
[2:49:01.640 --> 2:49:09.160]  people at oil companies and last night i just so happened to be somewhere at dinner where there
[2:49:09.160 --> 2:49:17.720]  was an oil company chief officer there and i was talking to him and he was going yeah no it it's
[2:49:17.720 --> 2:49:25.080]  it's all the dollar that's right and he said uh thank god for any speculation the speculations
[2:49:25.080 --> 2:49:29.080]  in the drilling mainly running around drilling everywhere which is good it actually causes
[2:49:29.080 --> 2:49:34.920]  exploration with larger wildcats that then cut out the big monopolies that are not drilling
[2:49:34.920 --> 2:49:40.360]  because they want to artificially suppress oil it's availability jack up prices
[2:49:42.040 --> 2:49:45.480]  you heard me with ray mcgovern former chief c i analyst for the president
[2:49:46.360 --> 2:49:50.680]  you had it you heard and i said it's it's they don't want to well the flow and he said that's
[2:49:50.680 --> 2:49:55.880]  right that's what this is about see the neocons get up and say see less oil is flowing we didn't
[2:49:55.880 --> 2:50:01.480]  do it for oil knowing they're talking to people that have minds less than that of a child
[2:50:04.920 --> 2:50:10.200]  just looking through a mercury kim trail
[2:50:14.280 --> 2:50:21.880]  fluoride haze listen to this oil prices will not come down it says opec boss
[2:50:21.880 --> 2:50:28.360]  us and they said no they're not going to be coming down uh that uh they just want stability
[2:50:29.320 --> 2:50:31.800]  and they said on the weekend i sat there and watched the opec meeting
[2:50:33.480 --> 2:50:37.720]  this is one in telegraph they said look the dollar's been devalued and that's the end of it and
[2:50:38.680 --> 2:50:42.360]  it's not our fault the speculators are trying to get out of the dollar so they're rushing into
[2:50:42.360 --> 2:50:46.520]  commodities that has increased at some but the line share of the increase 70 plus percent is the
[2:50:46.520 --> 2:50:51.640]  dollar devaluation and there's nothing we can do about it your governments did this
[2:50:51.640 --> 2:50:57.240]  they shall never hear that in our news because truth is something that just can't be heard on

[3:00:58.520 --> 3:01:02.920]  our journey towards enslavement is nearing completion fourth amendment completely overturned
[3:01:02.920 --> 3:01:09.080]  and abandoned first amendment annihilated removing forward against every one of the most basic rights
[3:01:10.120 --> 3:01:16.520]  here in the final days of the old republic will we be able to have it rise again like a phoenix
[3:01:16.520 --> 3:01:23.560]  from the ashes or will the new technocracy of dehumanization reign supreme loaded phone lines
[3:01:23.560 --> 3:01:26.920]  to talk to larry pratt coming up in the next segment we'll get to all of you on the second
[3:01:26.920 --> 3:01:32.760]  amendment finishing up with a story out of the register out of the united kingdom i experienced
[3:01:32.760 --> 3:01:37.480]  this we'd be quietly videotaping in london uh interviewing people on the street and cops would
[3:01:37.480 --> 3:01:43.640]  walk over and say get out of here i'm gonna arrest you no cameras no interviews and i'd say but is
[3:01:43.640 --> 3:01:48.120]  there a law and they just say i'm putting you in the database right now and i learned it was a
[3:01:48.120 --> 3:01:53.880]  terrorist database and they hire provocateurs that's in the news today police dress up and go to
[3:01:53.880 --> 3:01:59.800]  rallies and start fights to get people arrested that's all admitted mainstream news and the news
[3:01:59.800 --> 3:02:04.440]  kind of says maybe that's good you know maybe that's what freedom is uh it's kind of the whole
[3:02:04.440 --> 3:02:09.320]  attitude well our news is like maybe torture is good you know maybe maybe all of this is okay
[3:02:09.320 --> 3:02:18.440]  this is this great evil but in dc in austin texas all over i have cops walk over and say turn
[3:02:18.440 --> 3:02:22.840]  your camera off you're not allowed to be protesting not allowed to stand on the street corner uh but
[3:02:22.840 --> 3:02:27.240]  but england is the worst so they're going through where they just come up there's no law they just
[3:02:27.240 --> 3:02:31.720]  grab your film frisk you take it from you doesn't matter it says if you're mainstream press they
[3:02:31.720 --> 3:02:36.840]  still do it they put up all their cameras surveilling us they watch what we're doing they
[3:02:36.840 --> 3:02:42.840]  face scan us but then we don't go out and videotape them i mean this is total police state this is
[3:02:42.840 --> 3:02:49.720]  totally germany i mean it's happening and it goes on mr carol requested an explanation he asked
[3:02:49.720 --> 3:02:53.560]  whether he was obliged to hand over his film in vain every time he asked back came the same
[3:02:53.560 --> 3:03:00.440]  response i'm taking your film robo cop said when he eventually handed over his film he was asked
[3:03:00.440 --> 3:03:05.960]  to turn out his pockets and to show the other films he had on them the police filed out of the
[3:03:05.960 --> 3:03:10.920]  ubiquitous forms this one labeled stop and search and went on their way on the form quite
[3:03:10.920 --> 3:03:18.920]  clearly read are the words seized films no judge no jury no due process no process just arbitrary
[3:03:18.920 --> 3:03:25.960]  judge jury god absolute king of earth thug what are we to make of this a statement from
[3:03:25.960 --> 3:03:30.040]  humberside police reiterated that mr carol had been photographing sensitive buildings
[3:03:30.040 --> 3:03:34.600]  and that's anywhere sensitive and remarkably bullish as they pump the country full of foreigners
[3:03:34.600 --> 3:03:39.720]  by the way they uh added that they would expect other officers within the force to act the same
[3:03:39.720 --> 3:03:46.600]  manner if they given a similar situation but what situation and then it goes on to say this is
[3:03:46.600 --> 3:03:51.960]  seriously alarming stuff these stopping talks they just stop and interrogate you and then put you
[3:03:51.960 --> 3:03:57.160]  in a database this is seriously alarming stuff it's bad enough on its own but coupled with long
[3:03:57.160 --> 3:04:01.160]  catalog of other incidents that have been reported recently it begins to look like a pattern the
[3:04:01.160 --> 3:04:06.280]  government's ordered this what are you talking about they arrested a woman for reading a newspaper
[3:04:06.280 --> 3:04:14.040]  stopped and reading a newspaper that was in the london telegraph last year and the cops said that
[3:04:14.040 --> 3:04:19.720]  it had a headline about stop the war and that people on the street weren't allowed to see us
[3:04:19.720 --> 3:04:25.880]  a a a you think i'm joking folks you can go look it up that the officer didn't like that headline
[3:04:25.880 --> 3:04:33.640]  i mean this is i'm god this is drill camp you're at west point you're a cadet shut up slay you are
[3:04:33.640 --> 3:04:39.160]  a freshman cadet i'm gonna line you up i'm gonna tell you you got no rights i'm gonna tell you
[3:04:39.160 --> 3:04:44.840]  i'm arresting you for that newspaper cop walks by sees a person reading a newspaper with a coffee
[3:04:45.480 --> 3:04:53.000]  you know what i'm gonna go ahead and arrest you see it's meant to be insane it's meant to be crazy
[3:04:53.000 --> 3:04:56.920]  so you'll accept anything like the white house writing memos saying ripped children's genitals
[3:04:56.920 --> 3:05:03.080]  off of pliers they did that i mean that's that's that's that's a it's a searing of the conscience
[3:05:03.080 --> 3:05:08.520]  it's a it's a bathing and a tyranny and then it goes through all these examples it has links to
[3:05:08.520 --> 3:05:12.520]  news organizations where it's happening to their people and the cops steal the cameras
[3:05:13.640 --> 3:05:20.680]  just criminals hardcore crooks there to savagely bring you to submission and now in canada they

[3:08:41.320 --> 3:08:45.800]  on the meaning of the second amendment this is a massively historical case as big as
[3:08:45.800 --> 3:08:54.680]  roby wade when it comes to constitutional uh ruling monday they came out and in the past
[3:08:54.680 --> 3:08:59.480]  within a day or so they normally uh when they have their meeting to announce their rulings you
[3:08:59.480 --> 3:09:06.840]  then hear it but now they're talking about today tomorrow monday what the white house and the
[3:09:06.840 --> 3:09:14.040]  democrats have said they're unified on gun control to be clear is that they're for the second amendment
[3:09:14.040 --> 3:09:18.600]  but the second amendment means they can ban your guns and take them from you so it's it's warriors
[3:09:18.600 --> 3:09:24.280]  speak they're very good now it not fighting with us they make us think we've won and stab us in the
[3:09:24.280 --> 3:09:30.600]  butt it's a corporate delphi technique they say oh you you've got to write the dc gun ban is struck
[3:09:30.600 --> 3:09:37.880]  down uh they have to let people have guns through permits but they don't have to give you a permit
[3:09:37.880 --> 3:09:42.120]  and then a rain of terror is going to begin everywhere they triple the size of the batf
[3:09:42.120 --> 3:09:46.600]  all this is happening larry pratt executive director gunners of america gunners dot org
[3:09:47.480 --> 3:09:53.240]  we've never had more lawsuits more attacks more more bullet marking rules more it's it's all
[3:09:53.240 --> 3:10:00.520]  happening now more attacks on ammo makers gun owners dot org joins us to give us his expert
[3:10:00.520 --> 3:10:05.480]  analysis on when we're going to hear the hearing what he thinks going to happen why they're delaying
[3:10:05.480 --> 3:10:10.680]  it which is i i think is very ominous larry pratt thanks for coming on alex thank you for having me
[3:10:10.680 --> 3:10:16.360]  i really appreciate being with you again thank you tell us what's happening well the court has
[3:10:16.360 --> 3:10:25.000]  seven more decisions to go they've handed down some 30 20 some 30 whatever and they typically do all
[3:10:25.000 --> 3:10:32.840]  of their handing down of decisions during the month of june so that means by the calendar they
[3:10:32.840 --> 3:10:38.520]  probably will get finished doing them by next monday monday is one of the normal days they
[3:10:38.520 --> 3:10:43.880]  hand down decisions through the month thursday is another and now we're told that they may
[3:10:43.880 --> 3:10:51.560]  have decisions being handed down tomorrow as well so my guess is that if there's a last one
[3:10:51.560 --> 3:10:59.640]  it's likely to be dc versus heller the dc gun ban case they are no doubt faced with some
[3:11:00.280 --> 3:11:09.720]  political as well as internal disagreements on the court it's not too much of a bit of rocket
[3:11:09.720 --> 3:11:15.800]  science to conclude that there are going to be at least five justices for the position that there's
[3:11:15.800 --> 3:11:22.040]  an individual right to keep and bear arms that's protected by the second amendment and you know as
[3:11:22.040 --> 3:11:27.640]  far as it goes that's good because the anti's have been making their argument all along that
[3:11:27.640 --> 3:11:32.920]  you had no individual right to keep and bear arms that if you had a gun it was only because you were
[3:11:32.920 --> 3:11:38.760]  part of them militia of the state of whatever and had nothing to do with an individual right
[3:11:38.760 --> 3:11:43.880]  right that argument is going to go out the window almost certainly because five judges
[3:11:43.880 --> 3:11:51.560]  have said they buy the individual right however the the but it means that the devil will be in
[3:11:51.560 --> 3:11:58.040]  the details because none of them seem to be concerned about the last four words shall not
[3:11:58.040 --> 3:12:05.640]  be infringed and the discussion that we can imagine the discussion that we heard a little
[3:12:05.640 --> 3:12:12.040]  bit of in the hearing the oral argument that was presented before the supreme court several weeks ago
[3:12:12.840 --> 3:12:19.560]  has been on how much infringement can they get away with now justice stevens was the most brazen
[3:12:19.560 --> 3:12:26.840]  he was the one that actually asked mr heller's attorney what would you say would you agree with
[3:12:26.840 --> 3:12:35.400]  the view that the last part of the amendment could be interpreted to read shall not be
[3:12:35.400 --> 3:12:41.960]  unreasonably infringed unhappily the attorney answered in the affirmative and then he was
[3:12:41.960 --> 3:12:48.680]  asked two specific questions to nail that down and they were would it be reasonable
[3:12:48.680 --> 3:12:54.760]  then to ban machine guns another affirmative and would it be reasonable to require licenses
[3:12:54.760 --> 3:13:00.840]  to buy handguns which is something that was the underlying law before the dc gun ban
[3:13:01.720 --> 3:13:06.920]  technically is part of the power to license is the power to tax and destroy and we know
[3:13:06.920 --> 3:13:11.880]  that's the chicago new york model so so yes this is the bottom line and i want to see if you concur
[3:13:11.880 --> 3:13:18.680]  exactly on this or if you want to add a caveat or an addendum i have seen the policy in the last
[3:13:18.680 --> 3:13:24.840]  ten years eight years of the government switch to no longer having a frontal attack on us because
[3:13:24.840 --> 3:13:29.640]  our numbers were growing we were energized by the attack we were taking over states and and
[3:13:29.640 --> 3:13:35.000]  winning political battles to a stealth mode of you have a right to own guns but we have a right
[3:13:35.000 --> 3:13:39.960]  to ban them all basically or make you jump through five thousand flaming hoops and find the the
[3:13:39.960 --> 3:13:45.240]  bermuda triangle and swim around with a mermaid with your hands tied behind your back and and
[3:13:45.240 --> 3:13:50.280]  then fly to pluto and then you can own a gun and so they're going to go into that model and so we'll
[3:13:50.280 --> 3:13:55.160]  actually have a supreme court ruling saying yeah you can have a license you can be controlled and
[3:13:55.160 --> 3:14:01.480]  then it's all over a reign of terror act i quite agree with that and i would say so does the brady
[3:14:01.480 --> 3:14:07.880]  campaign to stop gun violence the old handgun control incorporated paul helmke their president
[3:14:07.880 --> 3:14:15.720]  spokesman uh said that uh in a way we can see an advantage of losing out on the idea that we can no
[3:14:15.720 --> 3:14:22.040]  longer have an outright ban on guns because now that boogie man can no longer be used by the pro
[3:14:22.040 --> 3:14:30.680]  gun people uh now we will just be talking about reasonable uh restrictions on a right to keep
[3:14:30.680 --> 3:14:34.760]  in bare arms that has been established now that's key i mean let's understand for everybody there's
[3:14:34.760 --> 3:14:41.400]  no debating this the pro gun ban the victim disarmament lobby likes this because it's one thing
[3:14:41.400 --> 3:14:46.600]  in their little playground of the district of criminals up there to disarm their slaves their
[3:14:46.600 --> 3:14:54.200]  their subjects but now they're going to have a ruling nationwide uh that that is only reflected
[3:14:54.200 --> 3:15:01.080]  of that one area and say oh you have the right to us to restrict your guns i mean this is incredible
[3:15:01.080 --> 3:15:08.280]  that's exactly the orwellian nature of what we're talking about it is truly uh something
[3:15:08.280 --> 3:15:14.840]  to behold and and it was something to behold to watch just as stevens in plain sight uh recorded
[3:15:14.840 --> 3:15:21.480]  you can still probably go to the supreme court website and hear the uh the recording uh you
[3:15:21.480 --> 3:15:26.920]  can almost see him taking out a copy of the second amendment getting the hold of those last four words
[3:15:26.920 --> 3:15:32.840]  and between not and infringed putting one of those little editorial carrots like an open triangle
[3:15:33.560 --> 3:15:39.880]  in between those last two words and writing on top unreasonably and hey yeah we're all in agreement
[3:15:39.880 --> 3:15:47.480]  it protects an individual right and we will tell you how it can be exercised and and really the only
[3:15:47.480 --> 3:15:53.720]  thing that we're in doubt about in my opinion and what i can't tell you with any specificity until
[3:15:53.720 --> 3:15:59.720]  we've read the decision is how much infringement do they openly declare they can get away with
[3:16:00.440 --> 3:16:06.760]  and so i think that's the only doubt that we have and frankly the once they have any infringement
[3:16:06.760 --> 3:16:11.640]  reserved into themselves that's really the same well what do you do though i mean the supreme
[3:16:11.640 --> 3:16:17.080]  court previously said blacks were only two-thirds human obviously if the supreme court rules they
[3:16:17.080 --> 3:16:23.240]  can you know cut our heads off without due process it's unconstitutional uh this is a fraud what do
[3:16:23.240 --> 3:16:29.560]  we do when the devastating ruling comes down a because it's going to neutralize mainline conservatives
[3:16:29.560 --> 3:16:33.720]  they're going to think oh it's a victory for the second amendment it's going to be advertised so
[3:16:33.720 --> 3:16:39.320]  that's a sleeping gas and then the states are all going to move as well as the feds with once an
[3:16:39.320 --> 3:16:44.680]  abandon against us we hope there's at least one exception in among the states and that's the
[3:16:44.680 --> 3:16:50.120]  state of montana its legislature passed a resolution which they brought to the attention
[3:16:50.120 --> 3:16:55.640]  of the supreme court one that's a formal brief but uh i'm pretty sure the supreme court knows about
[3:16:55.640 --> 3:17:01.800]  it it was published as a letter to the editor in the washington times and this resolution
[3:17:02.840 --> 3:17:07.880]  has a lot of warehouses and a number of resolves but the one that's i think the the real key
[3:17:08.440 --> 3:17:14.120]  is if the supreme court were to rule that in that it could infringe in any degree
[3:17:14.120 --> 3:17:22.040]  the second amendment then that would put into question the continuing validity of the compact
[3:17:22.040 --> 3:17:29.880]  read contract the compact by which montana joined the union in 1889 now them there is strong
[3:17:29.880 --> 3:17:36.920]  words because obviously when a when a contract is unilaterally broken by one party in this case
[3:17:36.920 --> 3:17:44.280]  the federal government then montana is released of any of its obligation to be part of the union and
[3:17:44.280 --> 3:17:50.760]  that's what they're saying now i think i'd mentioned to you before i thought our brief was edgy
[3:17:50.760 --> 3:17:57.080]  because we had reminded the court that uh the crown got shot at when they kept pushing and
[3:17:57.080 --> 3:18:02.600]  shooting at our guys uh when they kept shutting down our governments and our militias uh and so
[3:18:02.600 --> 3:18:07.640]  this generation is watching what the supreme court will do in this case and that's why they do it
[3:18:07.640 --> 3:18:12.920]  incrementally they've got to do it slow or it will become a shooting war well i think they're
[3:18:12.920 --> 3:18:18.200]  certainly concerned about that but what would happen if montana was actually not fooling which
[3:18:18.200 --> 3:18:24.920]  is a big if i admit but let's ask the question and do that are they sure that montana wouldn't
[3:18:24.920 --> 3:18:31.880]  just say you know what you have put not only into doubt you've busted the contract what you guys just
[3:18:31.880 --> 3:18:38.040]  did in that june umpteenth decision on the dc versus heller shows that you have nothing but
[3:18:38.040 --> 3:18:44.360]  contempt for the compact by which we entered the union and this was something that was guaranteed
[3:18:44.360 --> 3:18:51.080]  to not be altered in that compact and therefore you've gone and and broken it uh you know montana
[3:18:51.080 --> 3:18:57.080]  is not without recourse they could uh uh sidle up with uh the province of alberta which has nearly
[3:18:57.080 --> 3:19:04.600]  identical uh dislike of being in in the commonwealth of canada uh and between the two states they're
[3:19:04.600 --> 3:19:12.520]  sitting on uh tons and tons of oil um they're they could certainly finance their own uh operation
[3:19:13.160 --> 3:19:18.600]  and uh with air traffic being what it is i don't think they have to worry about being landlock
[3:19:18.600 --> 3:19:25.080]  so this is not really all that much of an idle threat if they choose uh to not blink
[3:19:25.080 --> 3:19:29.960]  well we got a rogue government larry pratt and nobody can deny that i want to come back with
[3:19:29.960 --> 3:19:36.360]  you and take some phone calls from joe and uh sandra and charles and bobby and uh others that
[3:19:36.360 --> 3:19:40.120]  are patiently holding to want to speak with you then we got erin zelman coming on to talk about
[3:19:40.120 --> 3:19:44.760]  this uh but for those that don't know uh this is what the biggest thing i've seen in the second
[3:19:44.760 --> 3:19:51.640]  amendment in my 34 35 years on the planet larry is this the most important biggest single thing
[3:19:51.640 --> 3:19:57.960]  you've ever seen what we're about to find out larry i think so between this and roe v wade i
[3:19:57.960 --> 3:20:03.240]  can't think of any two more major assaults on the constitution been lots of them but uh this is
[3:20:03.240 --> 3:20:07.080]  pretty brazen if they do what we think they're going to do and do you agree that they're going
[3:20:07.080 --> 3:20:11.880]  to come out and announce it as a victory to fool everybody oh no question why we just gave you
[3:20:11.880 --> 3:20:18.280]  an individual right gave you get that and but we can remove it if prescribed by law which is what

[3:25:04.360 --> 3:25:08.280]  with us with Aaron zelman in the next segment uh joe and pencilvania you're on the air with
[3:25:08.280 --> 3:25:14.360]  larry pratt thanks for holding i'm pretty pretty freaked out yeah me too uh welcome back from
[3:25:14.360 --> 3:25:18.440]  your vacation i hope you enjoyed it with your family um really i was so worried about the
[3:25:18.440 --> 3:25:24.120]  country i couldn't enjoy it yeah well uh you know a couple years ago a friend of mine applied for a
[3:25:24.120 --> 3:25:31.160]  uh concealed weapons permit and they're like took them like six months to get it now my dad
[3:25:31.160 --> 3:25:36.440]  is 69 and he applied sitting here in his house and he came back in like a month and a half and
[3:25:36.440 --> 3:25:41.400]  i was amazed and they just went they gave him a permit but anyway i was listening to what you guys
[3:25:41.400 --> 3:25:45.720]  had to say what you were talking about and everything and what what can be done you know
[3:25:45.720 --> 3:25:50.360]  there's a lot number one again they get you used to taking licenses and then within a generation
[3:25:50.360 --> 3:25:56.760]  they phase out the license but here's the deal talking about what can be done we have to admit
[3:25:56.760 --> 3:26:01.720]  they're coming after our guns first i've had people in gun stores in austin come up to me and tell me
[3:26:01.720 --> 3:26:08.040]  i'm a liar that bush wasn't for the assault of its ban larry pratt bush said if he if he had it on
[3:26:08.040 --> 3:26:13.880]  his desk at the congress delivered it to the white house he would sign it that was a public
[3:26:13.880 --> 3:26:20.760]  statement more than once uh that his spokesman made on his behalf so we knew the game in the house
[3:26:20.760 --> 3:26:27.160]  of representatives which at the time we had some fairly good muscle was to keep a vote from happening
[3:26:27.160 --> 3:26:33.480]  at all and then it finally expired as we know folks if we have the political will there's 160
[3:26:33.480 --> 3:26:38.120]  million gun owners probably more we can take the country back i mean larry is that the true statement
[3:26:38.120 --> 3:26:44.280]  it will stop letting the nr a sandbag us and and put us to sleep and if we realize they're a judo
[3:26:44.280 --> 3:26:49.560]  scott we can save the country yeah we gotta stop trying to put lipstick on a pig it really doesn't
[3:26:49.560 --> 3:26:56.760]  make the pig look any better exactly exactly so so i mean what's your solution i say get mad get
[3:26:56.760 --> 3:27:02.920]  aggressive never stop one of the things that's a big challenge that we need to do this year
[3:27:02.920 --> 3:27:10.120]  is no matter how discouraged people are about the presidential race do not neglect to go and vote we
[3:27:10.120 --> 3:27:16.920]  have congressional races in most states we have state races at the statewide level as well as local
[3:27:16.920 --> 3:27:23.080]  races all of those are terribly important and if there's a landslide that sweeps in a bunch of far
[3:27:23.080 --> 3:27:29.560]  left marxists and and whatever you and i both may say about the present rascals that are in there
[3:27:29.560 --> 3:27:34.920]  let's face it what's fixing to come in the tsunami would be like moving to the soviet union well
[3:27:34.920 --> 3:27:40.360]  that's my point is that both parties are are are basically wings on the same bird of prey and if we
[3:27:40.360 --> 3:27:45.480]  don't break the left right paradigm it's over oh absolutely i mean obama all the hell on earth is
[3:27:45.480 --> 3:27:51.000]  about to be released so it's important to go look for those folks that are running for office
[3:27:51.000 --> 3:27:55.320]  not getting the kind of attention that obviously the presidential candidates will
[3:27:55.320 --> 3:28:01.560]  who do show that they have some understanding and gumption look republicans need to run from
[3:28:01.560 --> 3:28:07.320]  george bush and run to ron paul they will get elected if they say look we are the real third
[3:28:07.320 --> 3:28:13.160]  party we are the real patriots they've got to explain that to people because the conservatives
[3:28:13.800 --> 3:28:19.080]  we're a conservative nation you know patriotic nation a bill of rights nation but only if it's
[3:28:19.080 --> 3:28:24.680]  a real party only if it's a real candidate sure in fact the the conservatives that have been active
[3:28:24.680 --> 3:28:30.440]  in the republican party often refer to themselves as the republican wing of the republican party
[3:28:30.440 --> 3:28:35.800]  which is a reference to the fact that there's so many of these rockefeller socialist types that
[3:28:35.800 --> 3:28:41.240]  that call themselves republican but have no intention whatsoever of doing anything except
[3:28:41.240 --> 3:28:44.680]  opposing the republican sander sander in california you're on the air go ahead
[3:28:44.680 --> 3:28:51.960]  you and honor you and thank you uh larry i spoke to your secretary yesterday because
[3:28:51.960 --> 3:28:58.840]  you weren't in your office about a very disturbing email that was dated june 19th it basically says

[3:29:20.920 --> 3:29:27.480]  and still would like us to have to pay an attacks for having an arsenal and i believe in her mind

[3:33:49.400 --> 3:33:56.120]  in the flood areas in houses that are even in dry areas ordering evacuations
[3:33:56.760 --> 3:34:00.360]  and then they go in your house and they bring cameras and they break in the door and take
[3:34:00.360 --> 3:34:05.000]  your guns out of your house you never get them back citizens that are caught driving around the
[3:34:05.000 --> 3:34:10.280]  streets they run up and aim guns at you and pull you out just any excuse to go crazy on us the
[3:34:10.280 --> 3:34:14.600]  supreme court's about to rule that they can restrict our second amendment it'll be hailed as a victory
[3:34:14.600 --> 3:34:19.880]  by the wolf and sheep's clothing n r a all over the country they don't let you videotape or talk to
[3:34:19.880 --> 3:34:24.840]  people on the street cops come up and fill out reports on you videotaping i mean it's like east
[3:34:24.840 --> 3:34:30.840]  germany uh we have larry pratt on with us we're also gonna have erin zellman on with us uh for the
[3:34:30.840 --> 3:34:39.160]  rest of this hour and take some of your your phone calls uh the police have been brainwashed
[3:34:39.160 --> 3:34:45.400]  that gun confiscation is good they're trained by the fbi at quantico your local police are uh
[3:34:45.400 --> 3:34:52.360]  they are treating us like we're the enemy and there's no light at the end of the tunnel it
[3:34:52.360 --> 3:35:01.560]  just gets worse and worse and worse and worse by the minute uh erin zellman every time there's
[3:35:01.560 --> 3:35:07.640]  a disaster they first priority is getting our guns not giving us aid this is a rogue government
[3:35:07.640 --> 3:35:13.560]  what do we do well i think the first thing you can do alex is uh spread the word i mean more
[3:35:13.560 --> 3:35:19.080]  people need to know what's wrong in the country more people need to know that this could uh
[3:35:20.120 --> 3:35:25.800]  that this situation could be on their doorstep someday well that was my other thing we have
[3:35:25.800 --> 3:35:33.640]  to do is really what needs to wake people up i i wanted to ask you this question too and of larry
[3:35:33.640 --> 3:35:37.080]  and then we'll take some calls and talk about the supreme court ruling erin zellman and the
[3:35:37.080 --> 3:35:43.240]  director of jews the preservation of farms ownership jpo dot org links to it up on info wars
[3:35:44.120 --> 3:35:48.680]  there's so many evil things i can't pile them all on i'm not overstating the case as you know
[3:35:48.680 --> 3:35:56.600]  from dallas texas to tucson arizona to denver to boston to new york to dc to miami the police
[3:35:56.600 --> 3:36:02.280]  now come and demand oakland to come in and search for illegal guns knock and talk is where they say
[3:36:02.280 --> 3:36:06.840]  let me in i want to check your guns in areas where guns are still legal where they're restricted
[3:36:06.840 --> 3:36:14.280]  like new york they demand to come in now uh in texas uh in ohio and indiana in new york
[3:36:14.280 --> 3:36:22.440]  they quote check your lock and come in or i mean this erin zellman don't these police know that
[3:36:22.440 --> 3:36:27.880]  this is classical tyranny well they may know it but again you have to remember that we've
[3:36:28.920 --> 3:36:35.000]  we're no longer a nation that has peace officers we know our nation that has law enforcement officers
[3:36:35.000 --> 3:36:40.520]  law enforcement officers are not concerned about keeping the peace as much as they are about enforcing
[3:36:40.520 --> 3:36:48.040]  any law they're ordered to enforce so tyranny is something that really means very little to them
[3:36:49.080 --> 3:36:54.440]  and um and and and and although and it will simply tell you we're just doing our job
[3:36:56.520 --> 3:37:01.800]  and and that's their attitude which we've heard before that that just my job that went down in
[3:37:01.800 --> 3:37:07.640]  normberg we're nazis kept saying we're just doing our job just following orders and that's what a lot
[3:37:07.640 --> 3:37:13.400]  of police officers are doing today just following orders so you don't have to look too far to find
[3:37:13.400 --> 3:37:17.880]  an enemy well i think it's a cop out with many when they say oh i'm just going to shoot them when
[3:37:17.880 --> 3:37:22.760]  they come from my guns and then they do and you get swat teamed and that's the end of it but i mean
[3:37:22.760 --> 3:37:27.240]  it's not a cop out when larry pratt puts that in the brief to the supreme court that it's going to
[3:37:27.240 --> 3:37:35.400]  lead to a shooting war and i think it really is going to lead to that and uh your comments on that
[3:37:35.400 --> 3:37:41.640]  erin zellman and then larry pratt well i noticed in the brief that we submitted to the supreme court
[3:37:41.640 --> 3:37:47.320]  which is on on the front page of our website jpfo.org we made it very clear that an armed
[3:37:47.320 --> 3:37:54.280]  citizen re-existed to defend itself against the government gone bad tyranny and i'm suspecting
[3:37:54.280 --> 3:37:59.080]  like this is speculation of course but tomorrow or thursday when we assume we're going to hear
[3:37:59.880 --> 3:38:03.560]  supreme's are going to come down from the mountaintop and pronounce so what what they think
[3:38:04.280 --> 3:38:10.280]  um it's going to be a situation where they're going to ignore an armed citizen re- as a reason
[3:38:10.280 --> 3:38:16.760]  to be armed and they probably will say that uh some effect well yeah dick heller has a right
[3:38:16.760 --> 3:38:22.840]  to carry a gun inside his broom closet inside his apartment and that gun control schemes uh
[3:38:22.840 --> 3:38:29.880]  uh as long as they're reasonable are certainly enforceable and i i think that uh we're gonna
[3:38:29.880 --> 3:38:35.960]  have a real battle on our hands determining what is reasonable from now on and i think that we
[3:38:35.960 --> 3:38:43.480]  are going to see at this week unless i am really surprised and shocked to the to the extreme that
[3:38:44.360 --> 3:38:50.280]  that the battle is going to start now for uh the battle in real earnest this is by the gun haters
[3:38:50.280 --> 3:38:56.280]  by the state if they to destroy a gun ownership in america yeah this is it i just one more thing
[3:38:56.280 --> 3:39:01.560]  before i forget this is really a double-edged sword because if they say well okay reasonable
[3:39:01.560 --> 3:39:06.120]  regulation is okay for the second amendment which is a right and of course at the doors
[3:39:06.120 --> 3:39:12.200]  wide open for all other rights well that is so key and they are attacking the fourth amendment
[3:39:12.200 --> 3:39:17.800]  the first amendment larry pratt comments on that key point that erin zelman just made i think he
[3:39:17.800 --> 3:39:24.200]  puts it very well that the only thing we don't know is how much infringement do they think they can
[3:39:24.200 --> 3:39:30.040]  infringe and get away with it and my guess is they're going to assume that they can get away
[3:39:30.040 --> 3:39:35.400]  with quite a bit because they've been educating us to accept the notion that anything the government
[3:39:35.400 --> 3:39:41.800]  says anything uh is the law because quote the government is the sovereign which is exactly
[3:39:41.800 --> 3:39:47.880]  wrong the people are the sovereign we tell the government what to do that's why we have a constitution
[3:39:47.880 --> 3:39:53.080]  that tells them the few things they can do and all the other things that they cannot do and
[3:39:53.080 --> 3:39:59.880]  you can look in vain in the constitution to see any place for the regulation of guns and you just
[3:39:59.880 --> 3:40:05.080]  aren't going to find it but they're going to find it because they're going to operate under the
[3:40:05.080 --> 3:40:11.720]  notion that they are the constitution that every time they meet there's a constitutional convention
[3:40:11.720 --> 3:40:18.280]  taking place and aren't we lucky that we have a constitution that can keep up with the times
[3:40:18.280 --> 3:40:22.760]  what about the militia question they're also uh going to rule on that we didn't have a national
[3:40:22.760 --> 3:40:29.240]  guard till after 1900 all the federalist papers all the debates say it's the independent citizens
[3:40:29.240 --> 3:40:35.240]  and that it's there to defend against a central government mainly criminal secondarily uh nation
[3:40:35.240 --> 3:40:41.240]  and that was the opinion of judge lauren silberman at the dc court of appeals uh his was an excellent
[3:40:41.240 --> 3:40:47.160]  decision and he did a very good job on this concept of militia but again i think if you
[3:40:47.720 --> 3:40:52.920]  assume that you can infringe then hey if you've got an individual right but we can infringe it what
[3:40:52.920 --> 3:40:58.200]  does that really mean well it means whatever we might believe before breakfast and as Humpty
[3:40:58.200 --> 3:41:03.240]  Dumpty said i can believe eight different things well i want to point something out here this isn't
[3:41:03.240 --> 3:41:07.720]  a joke folks they aren't just going to take the guns and then be friendly they want this because
[3:41:07.720 --> 3:41:12.360]  they're going to rape the hell out of us and you can make no mistake this government is mad dog evil
[3:41:12.360 --> 3:41:17.400]  it isn't about george bush or barack obama it's all run by the same global corporate interest
[3:41:17.400 --> 3:41:21.480]  they want to be able to loot this nation of its capital uh for its young men and women for the
[3:41:21.480 --> 3:41:26.600]  military they want full control they're not backing off and erin zellman i want to ask you both this
[3:41:26.600 --> 3:41:31.320]  then we're going to take calls uh this country started over them coming to take the guns that
[3:41:31.320 --> 3:41:37.560]  was it the raping the daughters the taxes the stealing the the guys in red coats beating people up and
[3:41:37.560 --> 3:41:44.120]  swaggering and being arrogant grabbing people off the beach and pressing them into the british navy
[3:41:44.120 --> 3:41:48.760]  as slaves white slaves folks you never hear about in the news because they want to make it a racial
[3:41:48.760 --> 3:41:56.440]  thing they they never want that known uh and and bottom line uh i mean i don't see anything else
[3:41:56.440 --> 3:42:00.600]  happening but that it's going to go ahead and lead into arm revolt and they're going to call people
[3:42:00.600 --> 3:42:07.000]  terrorist erin zellman well you may be right on that alex and as you know before we i want to remind
[3:42:07.000 --> 3:42:12.680]  people of something i've been telling folks for years on your show simply put master the art of
[3:42:12.680 --> 3:42:18.040]  long range rifle shooting and well if someone else feels a lot of others feel the onion on that
[3:42:18.680 --> 3:42:25.160]  but you're right in other words the uh uh that the government is is hell bent to have all the power
[3:42:25.160 --> 3:42:31.800]  and i will tell people that once they are able if they're able to uh obtain the complete ownership
[3:42:31.800 --> 3:42:37.720]  of firearms so the american people are disarmed uh you will see a draft come about drafting people
[3:42:37.720 --> 3:42:43.640]  for foreign wars and adventures the likes of which you can't even imagine so there's a lot
[3:42:43.640 --> 3:42:49.800]  of serious issues that are about to explode in this country if the american people are disarmed
[3:42:49.800 --> 3:42:55.320]  yeah tyranny's on the move larry pratt well alex i guess there's at least one difference between
[3:42:55.880 --> 3:43:03.000]  the revolutionary war era picture that you've just painted and today and that is that those who
[3:43:03.560 --> 3:43:10.760]  are working to take over our freedoms today don't wear red coats exactly but i mean how
[3:43:10.760 --> 3:43:17.880]  can the batf how can the police not know they're in the wrong well to a certain extent i think
[3:43:17.880 --> 3:43:23.800]  because the law of god's written on all of our hearts they know that but uh secondarily there's
[3:43:23.800 --> 3:43:29.240]  a lot of willful denial and there's a lot of educated ignorance uh they're going through
[3:43:29.240 --> 3:43:35.080]  schools that are telling them that the government is sovereign and we've got people coming out of
[3:43:35.080 --> 3:43:40.680]  schools well they can't wait to vote away their freedoms kept saying is that don't try to invent
[3:43:40.680 --> 3:43:45.320]  you know don't try to twist with lawyers speak uh what this says it's very clear it's to defend
[3:43:45.320 --> 3:43:49.160]  against government tyranny it's an absolute individual right i mean how can the supreme
[3:43:49.160 --> 3:43:54.200]  court ignore what the founders said the founders said anybody tries tries to put a lien on this
[3:43:54.200 --> 3:44:00.840]  tries to infringe on this wage war against them kill them well they feel that they can get away
[3:44:00.840 --> 3:44:06.680]  with it and frankly they have been getting away with it for a long long time they treat the
[3:44:06.680 --> 3:44:13.480]  constitution with utter contempt they properly understood they are under the constitution
[3:44:13.480 --> 3:44:17.960]  as they understand it they are the constitution well we're going to beat them this way and i'm
[3:44:17.960 --> 3:44:20.760]  going to tell all the listeners to this and i want to get both your take on this we will take
[3:44:20.760 --> 3:44:26.360]  calls go to gun owners of america dot org jpo dot org join both groups buy their books or videos
[3:44:26.360 --> 3:44:31.880]  educate everybody put them on access tv get the word out have local groups because this is life and
[3:44:31.880 --> 3:44:37.720]  death take two or three neighbors out a year bare minimum teach them how to shoot teach them the love
[3:44:37.720 --> 3:44:41.960]  of that then get them to be activists that's why i think we're going to win because i've seen an
[3:44:41.960 --> 3:44:47.720]  awakening a love of the second amendment all the liberals i know in austin have woken up they hate
[3:44:47.720 --> 3:44:53.160]  both parties now they're buying guns i mean for five six years are you not seeing erin zellman
[3:44:53.160 --> 3:44:59.240]  and larry pratt a huge awakening to government tyranny and now liberals i mean grassroots not
[3:44:59.240 --> 3:45:07.000]  the big ones are now converting to freedom well if i can go first on this larry i what i see is
[3:45:07.000 --> 3:45:13.720]  a grassroots awakening not just for for second amendment issues but the war on drugs the internal
[3:45:13.720 --> 3:45:21.240]  revenue service uh osha all of these government agencies that are dead that really are a bunch
[3:45:21.240 --> 3:45:26.600]  of jack bluetooth thugs to put it simply and so it is their kind of tyranny that is awakening
[3:45:26.600 --> 3:45:33.080]  millions and millions of people but many people have to realize you can't just man the barricades
[3:45:33.080 --> 3:45:39.240]  you've got to be in a situation where you're not going nose to nose with evil because evil will be
[3:45:39.240 --> 3:45:45.320]  better armed and equipped with your tax dollars by the way in other words the american people are
[3:45:45.320 --> 3:45:51.560]  financing their own destruction through through the tax system one of the hopeful signs that i've
[3:45:51.560 --> 3:45:56.520]  seen at gun owners of america is well give you an example i went out to speak to a local university
[3:45:57.320 --> 3:46:01.080]  and among the students who were there and there were a number of students
[3:46:01.080 --> 3:46:08.680]  uh there were several of them who were already members of gun owners of america so we're not
[3:46:08.680 --> 3:46:16.600]  just dealing with people in their 60s 70s and 80s we have members of that age but i'm quite
[3:46:16.600 --> 3:46:23.240]  aware of a large number and i believe it's a growing number of very young people who just
[3:46:23.240 --> 3:46:28.040]  like erin said they get it well i know that when my grandfathers went to world war two
[3:46:28.040 --> 3:46:32.200]  they were told things in boot camp and given manuals about you're going because the nazis
[3:46:32.200 --> 3:46:36.280]  want to take your property rights your free speech in your guns or we're fighting the soviets because
[3:46:36.280 --> 3:46:40.840]  they want your free speech in your guns and then now the government's attacking all that they are
[3:46:40.840 --> 3:46:47.880]  the bad guys period they've gotten their role just a little bit confused but then after all they've
[3:46:47.880 --> 3:46:53.880]  been allowed to think that they are the sovereigns for a long time not too surprising that they act
[3:46:53.880 --> 3:46:57.880]  this way let's take some calls charles and louisiana you're on the air with erin zelman to choose the
[3:46:57.880 --> 3:47:02.360]  preservation of firearms ownership and larry pratt two of the best fighters of the second
[3:47:02.360 --> 3:47:09.240]  amendment out there well you know how you've been doing mr jones uh mr pratt i was in a gun
[3:47:09.240 --> 3:47:13.400]  conversation in new allens and when i've seen in new allens i've seen one old woman
[3:47:14.200 --> 3:47:19.160]  uh come up to a door with a gun and a knife and the arrested her and that's only resistance
[3:47:19.160 --> 3:47:25.160]  in new allens head it was so terrible i thought i was mad but now i laugh at the people they're so
[3:47:25.160 --> 3:47:30.600]  they're so uh they they toast american people are toast you can't make them fight they don't
[3:47:30.600 --> 3:47:35.400]  believe in nothing all they want is football games and drugs i don't believe american people
[3:47:35.400 --> 3:47:40.040]  are ever fight i think they finished and they know they finished because we have let this government
[3:47:40.600 --> 3:47:47.400]  make us domestic cowards well that's certainly been that the hope and the the policy i would
[3:47:47.400 --> 3:47:52.280]  submit of especially the schools certainly the entertainment industry and the government
[3:47:52.280 --> 3:47:59.000]  supports that notion very handsomely but i i don't know that they've necessarily succeeded yet
[3:47:59.000 --> 3:48:05.480]  i think we'd be foolish to it to deny that what you've just described is a real big problem yeah
[3:48:05.480 --> 3:48:10.120]  let me chime in we've got a tough road to go up but the good news is it's always darkest before
[3:48:10.120 --> 3:48:16.200]  the dawn are there a bunch of decadent saps yes but i mean we had that 230 years ago it was four
[3:48:16.200 --> 3:48:21.240]  percent really two percent started the war four to five percent wanted and we've got more than five
[3:48:21.240 --> 3:48:26.040]  percent we still got a lot of good people we got good people in government i mean look 75 percent
[3:48:26.040 --> 3:48:30.600]  of the republican donations were to ron paul and i'm telling you i'm not being a cheerleader here
[3:48:30.600 --> 3:48:35.960]  i'm seeing an explosive awakening that's why the government's moving against us erin zellman
[3:48:37.000 --> 3:48:41.640]  well i think you have a point there uh elix before i forget you you were mentioning about
[3:48:41.640 --> 3:48:46.760]  world war two and the films they showed people if people have a chance to get a hold of a series of
[3:48:46.760 --> 3:48:55.000]  films called why we fight which was created during world war two it helps people better understand
[3:48:55.720 --> 3:49:01.560]  why people should fight to preserve american values and these films were shown to the american
[3:49:01.560 --> 3:49:08.280]  people and of course people in the military and it uh it created a demand a groundswell in america
[3:49:08.280 --> 3:49:13.960]  to preserve freedom and so if you have a chance to get a hold of these films called why we fight
[3:49:15.000 --> 3:49:19.880]  most of them they're very they're very cheap they're available and somebody may be on on youtube
[3:49:20.840 --> 3:49:26.120]  anyway to go to your next question i think that there may be an awakening out there i don't see
[3:49:26.120 --> 3:49:31.320]  that that much i think there may be an awakening by some people but i still i don't see a lot of
[3:49:31.320 --> 3:49:37.720]  gun owners waking up i see a lot of gunners still thinking well uh things are going to be okay they
[3:49:37.720 --> 3:49:42.040]  couldn't do this it couldn't happen here they're not going to take my shotgun and all the rest of
[3:49:42.040 --> 3:49:48.520]  that nonsense and finally i know that uh i want to make sure that everyone understands larry's not
[3:49:48.520 --> 3:49:54.280]  joining in in with me when i say this but i've got a real gripe with the national rifle association
[3:49:54.920 --> 3:50:02.120]  because they still do not want to abolish the atf they had the chance many years ago they took a pass
[3:50:02.120 --> 3:50:08.760]  on it and because of their compromising today they're innocent gun owners like dave oliveson
[3:50:08.760 --> 3:50:13.320]  going to prison well well erin's element i don't want to disagree with you but it's not compromise
[3:50:13.320 --> 3:50:17.880]  compromises if they give up something and we give up something we always give in and they
[3:50:17.880 --> 3:50:23.960]  always push us over the cliff i'm afraid that's accurate yeah i'll accept that yeah i mean it's
[3:50:23.960 --> 3:50:28.840]  not compromising it's it's it's benedict arnold behavior but alex i think your point that you
[3:50:28.840 --> 3:50:35.960]  made a minute ago needs to be kept in mind because we can easily focus on the enormous number of bad
[3:50:35.960 --> 3:50:41.800]  things that are happening and forget that it looked at least that grim when the men signed the
[3:50:41.800 --> 3:50:46.920]  declaration of independence they had a kind of scaffold humor as they were signing it
[3:50:46.920 --> 3:50:52.600]  joking with each other well i'm signing my death certificate uh they knew that well that's what
[3:50:52.600 --> 3:50:56.200]  signing or john hancock meant he said they said you know we're gonna get killed for this he said
[3:50:56.200 --> 3:51:01.640]  well good let my name be the biggest go ahead sorry larry the point is majorities don't make history
[3:51:01.640 --> 3:51:07.320]  it's minorities that do they were what 56 men well i'm gonna say this right now i don't want to die
[3:51:07.320 --> 3:51:12.200]  but i am ready to die for this and i am not backing down and i'm not stopping i'm gonna talk during

[3:55:33.080 --> 3:55:41.160]  okay alex yes uh i just want to say that you uh you're doing a great job and the thing to
[3:55:41.160 --> 3:55:48.760]  remember is that this is an inalienable right and it existed even before you had our present
[3:55:48.760 --> 3:55:55.080]  constitution uh the declaration of independence states that it's an organic right that comes from
[3:55:55.080 --> 3:56:02.200]  your being a free human creature exactly and the other thing is that justice brier has been putting
[3:56:02.200 --> 3:56:11.320]  on uh complete uh fallacious reasoning because he says that shouldn't a locale have the right to
[3:56:12.440 --> 3:56:18.120]  restrict firearms and it's not the locale that has the right it's only the individual that has
[3:56:18.120 --> 3:56:23.640]  that god given right and they all know that those arch crooks all know it they were made supreme court
[3:56:23.640 --> 3:56:28.680]  justice because they're whores they're political pimps i appreciate your call comments on that larry
[3:56:28.680 --> 3:56:35.720]  and erin well it's hard to uh to argue with uh the fact that it isn't an alienable right it's the
[3:56:35.720 --> 3:56:41.560]  way god made us uh he didn't give us the gift of life so that we could throw it away to crooks
[3:56:41.560 --> 3:56:47.560]  and the tyrants period humans have always fought we've always had tools and weapons well let me
[3:56:47.560 --> 3:56:52.680]  just share a thought with you very quickly uh from a jewish perspective concerning uh defending
[3:56:52.680 --> 3:56:59.080]  your life uh there's a quote from the talmud it says if a man comes to kill you arise quickly and
[3:56:59.080 --> 3:57:05.800]  kill him and i think americans need to understand that quote fully they have to think about it
[3:57:05.800 --> 3:57:12.280]  think about it then be ready to act well it's common sense and when you have a nation of people
[3:57:12.280 --> 3:57:16.600]  that are wimps you're the tyrant the tyrants will come when you got a nation of people ready to ready
[3:57:16.600 --> 3:57:23.000]  to fight to the death you have liberty i can't believe this is happening i just at times like
[3:57:23.000 --> 3:57:27.320]  this i can't even have composure folks uh scott in california final caller go ahead
[3:57:29.000 --> 3:57:33.560]  yeah you're looking for scott in colorado okay colorado go ahead sir yeah but uh hey alex how
[3:57:33.560 --> 3:57:38.680]  you doing larry and erin hey uh it's real quick what what is the definition of a well organized
[3:57:38.680 --> 3:57:45.800]  militia well that's something that george mason coined it was a term that he began to use in
[3:57:45.800 --> 3:57:54.200]  1775 in the in the face of british growing british oppression not only closing down legislatures but
[3:57:54.200 --> 3:58:01.800]  making it illegal for militias to meet banning the importation of guns the uh the colonists were
[3:58:01.800 --> 3:58:07.240]  coming upon a very difficult time in defending themselves and to distinguish then from what
[3:58:07.240 --> 3:58:13.480]  the brits were trying to do in this particular case to the militia mason coined the term of a
[3:58:13.480 --> 3:58:19.480]  well-regulated militia which would be the embodiment of the power of the people now regulated just
[3:58:19.480 --> 3:58:25.480]  means every town's got a bunch of people armed and trained but directed by the locals trained
[3:58:25.480 --> 3:58:31.240]  being the the key element in the word and as you say by locals uh these things were under
