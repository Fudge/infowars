[00:00.000 --> 00:14.160]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he he's Alex
[00:14.160 --> 00:24.560]  on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones let's go right here
[00:24.560 --> 00:31.920]  calls let's go to Neil in Canada farming and prepping that sounds evil go ahead Neil yeah
[00:31.920 --> 00:38.840]  I'm calling from Canada as I said anyway I'm a little nervous I haven't called on
[00:38.840 --> 00:49.360]  there for the first time yes I was watching a movie that I downloaded last night and have
[00:49.360 --> 00:57.200]  you ever heard of Michael Rupert yes I have yeah I watched his film about his take on
[00:57.200 --> 01:03.880]  9-11 it sounded very convincing that that's how it probably happened and he's a bit more
[01:03.880 --> 01:11.960]  of a pessimist he just says basically it's gonna happen get get prepared get ready it's
[01:11.960 --> 01:20.520]  gonna happen I guess I more take on his side I'm not saying that what you guys do is not
[01:20.520 --> 01:25.160]  helpful I think if anything you're slowing down the new world order crowd you're slowing
[01:25.160 --> 01:32.880]  them down yeah well here's the deal Mike Mike's an interesting fellow my issue is he thinks
[01:32.880 --> 01:39.120]  everything's gonna collapse because our world's unsustainable well the globalist are artificially
[01:39.120 --> 01:43.760]  collapsing it sure there's some problems with our industrial society and it could be cleaner
[01:43.760 --> 01:48.840]  and better but they're just opportunistically the globalist are using that as agenda 21
[01:48.840 --> 01:53.160]  to implode things and so they push the whole peak oil thing and the rest of it while they
[01:53.160 --> 01:59.560]  try to shut off coal while they try to build more nuclear which is just crazy so you know
[01:59.560 --> 02:05.120]  that's my take on it is that it is globalist propaganda the whole peak oil thing that doesn't
[02:05.120 --> 02:10.760]  mean somebody's bad or somebody's an agent if they believe it it just means I disagree
[02:10.760 --> 02:18.240]  with them and I know where that worldview originated from and it originated from the
[02:18.240 --> 02:24.880]  globalist you see what I'm saying I would rather be safe than sorry and and and I'm
[02:24.880 --> 02:30.880]  not I'm on a fixed income you know I can't help it I'm on disability up here in Canada
[02:30.880 --> 02:35.240]  and I'm gonna do what little I can you know incrementally hopefully the collapse won't
[02:35.240 --> 02:41.800]  happen very soon you know if it does at all I mean I just want to be ready for what if
[02:41.800 --> 02:46.920]  if and when it happens well I mean Canada's run by the Queen and her governor general
[02:46.920 --> 02:53.360]  and so other than social engineering and destroying the family and domesticating people Canada
[02:53.360 --> 02:58.440]  is probably one of the safer zones to be in it's an incredible police state with a velvet
[02:58.440 --> 03:05.760]  glove on it very authoritarian but but for the general energy units the human resource
[03:05.760 --> 03:10.720]  units and known as humans there it'll be one of the better zones the globalist plan civil
[03:10.720 --> 03:17.760]  war and mass reeducation and extermination here in the US if they get their way they're
[03:17.760 --> 03:22.160]  going to send us the camps I don't even know if there are camps in Canada oh yeah you have
[03:22.160 --> 03:26.440]  emergency relocation centers that operates as the cover for internment facilities that's
[03:26.440 --> 03:33.120]  on record and there isn't you are under Northcom you are under a EU American Union bilateral
[03:33.120 --> 03:40.000]  2007 Northcom agreement so you're actually under Northcom you're in the military jurisdiction
[03:40.000 --> 03:48.920]  of the Saxe-Cobart-Gotha Rothschild Rockefeller Combine in an area designated as an energy
[03:48.920 --> 03:57.080]  sector and globalist elite retreat yeah I was wondering what if the US economy does
[03:57.080 --> 04:02.720]  does implore which we do believe it likely will happen would be would our dollar become
[04:02.720 --> 04:09.880]  just as worthless as yours no but it will be devalued I mean and that's a that's a
[04:09.880 --> 04:19.560]  probability scenario again you're fully captured and so we again you've never really resisted
[04:19.560 --> 04:25.520]  the New World Order so you'll be you'll be murdered later the United States after they're
[04:25.520 --> 04:31.440]  done using us as the Empire is to be absolutely decimated and then the population implanted
[04:31.440 --> 04:36.800]  with diseases and cancer and just slaughtered up one side and down the other I was more
[04:36.800 --> 04:41.600]  like I don't know if any of those pepper books have anything about more net all natural farming
[04:41.600 --> 04:46.240]  like 19th century wonderful it's wonderful and globalist are targeting it everywhere
[04:46.240 --> 04:50.760]  while saying they like on one side of their mouth savagely releasing bureaucrats worldwide
[04:50.760 --> 04:55.600]  to attack it anyway they can they see any natural human activity as the enemy they want
[04:55.600 --> 05:00.960]  you dead after they suck the energy out of you they see you as a human resource sick

[08:21.560 --> 08:30.560]  Jones I remember well interviewing more than a decade ago and so much of what he first
[08:30.560 --> 08:35.880]  talked about is now been documented and admitted on the subject of coconut oil helping stop
[08:35.880 --> 08:41.720]  or reverse Alzheimer's the statin drugs were attacking people's brains he developed decades
[08:41.720 --> 08:47.760]  ago the term excitotoxin which is now in the mainline literature he doesn't really to his
[08:47.760 --> 08:53.480]  horn but he's one of the top medical advisors and writers over at newsmax.com and at least
[08:53.480 --> 09:00.320]  he has been in the past and he is just a trailblazer who speaks to giant packed houses all over
[09:00.320 --> 09:06.880]  the country in the world to medical doctors and he has just just pioneered so much of
[09:06.880 --> 09:13.240]  what we now know about chronic inflammation in the brain from vaccines you name it doctor
[09:13.240 --> 09:20.200]  Russell Blalock is a registered board certified neurosurgeon and a bestselling author he is
[09:20.200 --> 09:26.200]  a former clinical assistant professor of neuro neurosurgery at the University of Mississippi
[09:26.200 --> 09:31.760]  Medical Center he is the author of a number of books and numerous scientific papers and
[09:31.760 --> 09:38.680]  articles including excitotoxins the taste that kills 1994 health and nutrition secrets
[09:38.680 --> 09:45.040]  that can save your life 2002 natural strategies for cancer patients 2003 and writes a monthly
[09:45.040 --> 09:49.880]  newsletter the Blalock wellness report and I'm not going to go through all of his incredible
[09:49.880 --> 09:58.080]  bio Russell Blalock MD.com is just one of his websites or Blalock Wellness Center.com
[09:58.080 --> 10:03.640]  and the second part of the interview this hour we'll get into vaccines damaging the
[10:03.640 --> 10:09.760]  brain these low cholesterol diets what that's doing on top of the statins some stuff that
[10:09.760 --> 10:14.960]  can really help people because I'm starting to hear this in mainline radio mainline news
[10:14.960 --> 10:20.760]  and folks we need to appreciate trailblazers because I remember when he was on three and
[10:20.760 --> 10:25.480]  a half years ago during the fake H1N1 saying it's all fake it'll increase your chances
[10:25.480 --> 10:29.560]  of getting the flu it's going to actually hurt people all of that a year later came
[10:29.560 --> 10:35.400]  out and Canadian German studies but he got attacked by the national media for coming
[10:35.400 --> 10:40.480]  on this show and for talking about it and you know the point is is this is a guy who
[10:40.480 --> 10:45.600]  full time tries to warn people and who's going out and because we've sent people to
[10:45.600 --> 10:50.040]  interview him you know in big cities where there's you know 2000 doctors packing the
[10:50.040 --> 10:54.680]  room sold out where we can't even get seats but we're in the back video taping it you
[10:54.680 --> 10:57.920]  know so we can come back and show it to you here on the news what he breaks down and he
[10:57.920 --> 11:03.400]  is one of the unsung revolutionaries that's going to lead the new renaissance out of this
[11:03.400 --> 11:06.880]  so when we talk about stuff for Alzheimer's this is one of the leading experts you better
[11:06.880 --> 11:12.520]  listen the medical establishment is ignorant at the low level but on top they the system
[11:12.520 --> 11:17.560]  does not want you to know about these treatments that are incredible so I've said that the
[11:17.560 --> 11:21.280]  reason I want to get him on the first part of the interview will show viewers if you're
[11:21.280 --> 11:34.160]  radio listeners this is up at info wars.com CEO sees Obama health law doubling some premiums
[11:34.160 --> 11:40.280]  health insurance premiums may as much as double for some small businesses etna CEO is saying
[11:40.280 --> 11:46.160]  this health insurance premiums may as much as double for some small businesses and individual
[11:46.160 --> 11:51.840]  buyers in the US when the affordable care acts major provisions kick in and that is what
[11:51.840 --> 11:57.120]  their chief executive said here's another one LA Times blue shield of California seeks
[11:57.120 --> 12:04.440]  rate hike of 20% and then another 20% in 2014 folks my dad manages he corrected me I said
[12:04.440 --> 12:09.160]  a dozen I would just say a dozen when I know it's something like that 18 dental offices
[12:09.160 --> 12:12.640]  but he also manages a bunch of other health care stuff non dental I'm not going to get
[12:12.640 --> 12:18.320]  into it but he's a dentist oral surgeon everything dr. Blalock told us about obama care three
[12:18.320 --> 12:23.000]  years ago is exactly what my dad says but now it's happening up two big medical groups
[12:23.000 --> 12:26.940]  just being the United States they're just shutting down in Texas they're just not going
[12:26.940 --> 12:32.080]  to operate now most the dentist he knows some of them they're 50 years old they got 20 years
[12:32.080 --> 12:38.400]  in them they're just retiring they're done I'm gonna have dr. Blalock we have the floor
[12:38.400 --> 12:42.800]  here and tell you what this is going to do of course the government knows it's gonna
[12:42.800 --> 12:47.120]  wreck health care then they take it over the insurance companies wrote this it doesn't
[12:47.120 --> 12:50.640]  cover pre-existing all the fools that they get a free lunch it lets the government say
[12:50.640 --> 12:55.480]  through a computer what treatments you can give and that's why doctors are just I'm done
[12:55.480 --> 13:00.480]  I'm not gonna have a death panel that's what it is as Bill Gates said call it a death panel
[13:00.480 --> 13:05.880]  we need it the government now runs our health care the government the IRS now gets your
[13:05.880 --> 13:10.640]  health records Nixon was gonna go to jail for having IRS records and he's the president
[13:10.640 --> 13:16.680]  now now it's just on the books that the the giant bureaucracy has it I'm gonna shut up
[13:16.680 --> 13:22.160]  now sir go over it all for us here and and and now people are seeing this wasn't rhetoric
[13:22.160 --> 13:27.880]  the fools out there now are gonna see a doubling in the next few years of their health care
[13:27.880 --> 13:33.920]  cost because an industry now can force you to buy their product dr. Blalock well you're
[13:33.920 --> 13:39.120]  exactly right and of course what people need to understand this isn't no this wasn't created
[13:39.120 --> 13:44.720]  under bomb administration this wasn't in the last 10 years they have been working on this
[13:44.720 --> 13:53.160]  for over half a century these people have been obsessed with taking over medical care
[13:53.160 --> 13:58.760]  because medical care such a huge segment of the economy it's important to control people
[13:58.760 --> 14:04.840]  it's important if you want to control populations if they want to implement their ideas which
[14:04.840 --> 14:15.440]  you can read about many years ago back in 1910 they were talking about controlling births
[14:15.440 --> 14:20.520]  killing off old people because they were no longer useful to society so all this was
[14:20.520 --> 14:26.280]  in the plans and have they've been working on it all of this time now as a physician
[14:26.280 --> 14:32.160]  we saw it much earlier than everyone else because they did it incrementally and twenty
[14:32.160 --> 14:38.160]  thirty years ago I was fighting this when I was in practice my fellow physicians I had
[14:38.160 --> 14:44.440]  more opposition from the fellow physicians than I did the enemies in government and other
[14:44.440 --> 14:50.040]  places the liberal left who wanted this your fellow physician who was fighting you the
[14:50.040 --> 14:55.600]  most the reason was they thought well you know we're pretty smart guys and I think if
[14:55.600 --> 15:00.960]  we just work with them we just let them know that we'll help them save cost and we'll be
[15:00.960 --> 15:06.880]  reasonable in what we do then they're going to come around and say okay that's all we
[15:06.880 --> 15:11.920]  wanted you to do is be reasonable I told these physicians I said you don't understand
[15:11.920 --> 15:17.480]  socialism and collectivism and you haven't read these papers written by these designers
[15:17.480 --> 15:22.440]  these elitist social engineers they don't care whether you're reasonable or not their
[15:22.440 --> 15:30.280]  intention is total absolute control well we've arrived we're here now now the purpose of
[15:30.280 --> 15:36.680]  doubling premiums and private insurance is to force you into the government total control
[15:36.680 --> 15:40.480]  and you said that you said that it's meant to bankrupt the system and for those that
[15:40.480 --> 15:45.640]  don't know they're going after former state medical board doctors and people the states
[15:45.640 --> 15:49.880]  and the feds for those that don't know they're arresting and harassing doctors everywhere
[15:49.880 --> 15:53.800]  that give you the care you need when they don't follow what the computer tells them
[15:53.800 --> 16:00.920]  to do some of the cases are just unbelievable of the abuse of the physician because the
[16:00.920 --> 16:08.280]  physician was handed a group of rules when you join Medicare or Medicaid and the rules
[16:08.280 --> 16:13.560]  of course like all social assistance to draw you in it first relax they're not enforced
[16:13.560 --> 16:18.720]  and then once you're hooked then they start increasing the number of regulations the number
[16:18.720 --> 16:24.480]  of laws and then they start picking positions to make examples of well we've reached a lot
[16:24.480 --> 16:30.360]  of those cases now there's a case that's just recently reported in which a 63 year old
[16:30.360 --> 16:40.400]  vascular surgeon was targeted and they examined over 4,000 of his records they found two records
[16:40.400 --> 16:45.480]  in which they said well you know some of your language is not proper they left he left out
[16:45.480 --> 16:54.080]  a 2TO and his coding for five patients was challenged by the federal government now if
[16:54.080 --> 17:01.320]  you don't understand medical coding everything a doctor does to the most minor procedure
[17:01.320 --> 17:08.960]  in the office to the most complex surgery as a CPT code the government code which has
[17:08.960 --> 17:14.360]  to do with reimbursement you're told as a physician everything you do in which you build
[17:14.360 --> 17:21.600]  the government has to have a CPT code well the problem is there are tens of thousands
[17:21.600 --> 17:26.760]  of procedures for which there's no CPT code so when we asked well what do we do about
[17:26.760 --> 17:32.040]  that they said well it's just coded as close as you can positions took them at their word
[17:32.040 --> 17:37.360]  well now they decided we need some examples of physician abuse so they target people
[17:37.360 --> 17:42.880]  like this vascular surgeon they said as you've coded him properly and we're going to put
[17:42.880 --> 17:49.840]  you in jail and of course he's gotten a sentence of 10 months in prison defrauding the federal
[17:49.840 --> 17:54.000]  government now did he defraud the government well this is interesting thing about the
[17:54.000 --> 18:00.960]  law the law says we don't have to show that you intended in any way to defraud the government
[18:00.960 --> 18:07.600]  just making an error is evidence of fraud and abuse and that's why all these companies
[18:07.600 --> 18:11.720]  are even getting out of the business now the big mega insiders are left alone it's the
[18:11.720 --> 18:16.960]  smaller and medium-sized companies can be white glove inspected there's no way to operate
[18:16.960 --> 18:22.400]  that's why these companies are just shutting down successful providing good care profitable
[18:22.400 --> 18:27.160]  they're just shutting down which again the socialists know that will bankrupt the whole
[18:27.160 --> 18:32.280]  system and then you'll be forced into total government control that's right and that's
[18:32.280 --> 18:37.800]  what they want you know socialism is about control people need to understand that all
[18:37.800 --> 18:43.440]  these people that are excited about socialism and and collectivism it's about human control
[18:43.440 --> 18:48.040]  you're told what to do if you don't and you're not obedient you're going to be punished they
[18:48.040 --> 18:52.720]  make that quite plain and this is what the physicians are learning now I told them that
[18:52.720 --> 18:59.560]  20 years ago they didn't believe it now they're going to prison for very long term 10 years
[18:59.560 --> 19:05.640]  20 years ruining their life taking their license away and by the way I hear that exact talk
[19:05.640 --> 19:10.040]  for a decade you know the doctors and the company say we'll just kind of work with them
[19:10.040 --> 19:14.160]  and be reasonable and we're sure we'll be all right no there's no way out you're being
[19:14.160 --> 19:21.520]  mafia taken over and they're targeting these people and destroying their reputations destroying
[19:21.520 --> 19:27.560]  their life put them in prison with common criminals and you could be killed in prison
[19:27.560 --> 19:32.320]  and I have cases of physicians in which they purposely tried to do that they moved them
[19:32.320 --> 19:37.200]  across the country so they couldn't be near their families you know this this is just
[19:37.200 --> 19:41.880]  a stuff right out of the Soviet Union and communist China that we're seeing implemented
[19:41.880 --> 19:46.240]  yeah they're targeting the intelligentsia that has served the system so well they're
[19:46.240 --> 19:51.800]  now just a high-tech lynching like pullpots shot people with glasses who can read here
[19:51.800 --> 19:56.240]  they just take your license and put you in jail we'll be back with dr. blalock on the

[24:17.880 --> 24:23.160]  gentlemen retired brain surgeon best-selling author dr. Russell playlock is our guest
[24:23.160 --> 24:28.520]  for the balance of the hour that will be news and calls in the third hour coming up now
[24:28.520 --> 24:32.600]  again a lot of doctors say well I can't even make money doing this it's too dangerous I'm
[24:32.600 --> 24:38.360]  out of health care well you predicted that that's the plan bankrupt it but and it takes
[24:38.360 --> 24:44.000]  a huge majority now to overturn obama care really banker care globalist eugenics care
[24:44.000 --> 24:50.000]  what do you now predict dr. playlock is going to happen as people learn as bill gates has
[24:50.000 --> 24:54.760]  laughed we may play that clip later that yeah death panels are good name well now we see
[24:54.760 --> 24:59.400]  the social engineering well if we're all collectivized the government's going to say what you eat
[24:59.400 --> 25:03.440]  and where you go and what you do and what surgeries you get and guess what that's what
[25:03.440 --> 25:08.720]  they've already done in england where you wait what 18 months on average for brain surgeries
[25:08.720 --> 25:12.000]  that you need to get it quickly or you're going to die and I've watched the house of
[25:12.000 --> 25:17.680]  commons debates I haven't how are they going to sell this and keep this in place when it
[25:17.680 --> 25:24.440]  wrecks everything well the idea is every failure is going to be because of sabotage if you
[25:24.440 --> 25:30.120]  look at the Soviet system and all the communist socialist systems they do the same thing when
[25:30.120 --> 25:36.120]  they start to fail it's not their fault it's because people were sabotaging it the doctors
[25:36.120 --> 25:42.000]  weren't playing fair the doctors were cheating the patients weren't doing the right so they
[25:42.000 --> 25:47.600]  just throw more money at it they increase the regulations the control and so the answer
[25:47.600 --> 25:54.200]  is always the problem is we don't have enough control of all the variables which means oppression
[25:54.200 --> 26:00.800]  we have to oppress the public and the providers and the whole medical care system and then
[26:00.800 --> 26:06.880]  it'll work and once people take this bitter medicine they realize gee now we've arrived
[26:06.880 --> 26:13.400]  at the utopia you know as I tell people collectivism and socialism depends on what's called the
[26:13.400 --> 26:19.840]  big lie you paint this illusion of this utopia that's coming and you tell people just keep
[26:19.840 --> 26:25.640]  your eye on the painting on the mural don't pay attention to reality they're never allowed
[26:25.640 --> 26:30.600]  to look at reality and every time they do they say just look back at the mural look
[26:30.600 --> 26:36.640]  what's coming if you just do what you're told so people get on board and every communist
[26:36.640 --> 26:42.360]  country every communist that's escaped they said the same thing they were all true believers
[26:42.360 --> 26:48.040]  in the beginning and very very quickly they understood that we're being deceived we're
[26:48.040 --> 26:53.320]  being lied to we're being led and regimented and controlled and that's what this is all
[26:53.320 --> 26:58.760]  about so of course there's going to be devastation there's going to be death there's going to
[26:58.760 --> 27:04.120]  be people dying there's going to be care denied but they'll say oh this this is just the the
[27:04.120 --> 27:11.480]  painful growth pains this is the birth pains as of the coming utopia once we fared all
[27:11.480 --> 27:16.880]  this out it's going to be great and of course all this pain is because of the previous system
[27:16.880 --> 27:20.800]  you know it's just like they always blame bush or they blame somebody else for every
[27:20.800 --> 27:28.680]  system that happens a disaster in this administration is due to the previous administration and so
[27:28.680 --> 27:35.560]  the fact that capitalism existed for so long and private property and this excessive freedom
[27:35.560 --> 27:40.840]  that's why we're having to go through these terrible birth pain so they're going to justify
[27:40.840 --> 27:48.080]  every failure just to show how idiotic this thing is there's a law that says if a physician
[27:48.080 --> 27:56.000]  charges the taxpayer too little money he is guilty of a crime now this is unbelievable
[27:56.000 --> 28:02.400]  the whole idea of these doctors going to prison is that they were defrauding the taxpayer
[28:02.400 --> 28:09.280]  well here if you actually are saving the taxpayer money by undercoding that is coding for a
[28:09.280 --> 28:15.720]  less expensive procedure you're also guilty of the kind of crime just the same as if you
[28:15.720 --> 28:21.600]  overcharge the government and for those that don't know that's the age old thing were doctors
[28:21.600 --> 28:26.280]  in the Hippocratic oath Ron Paul talked about it here on the show medical doctor that you
[28:26.280 --> 28:30.960]  were told going to medical school you should do about a third of your work a discounted
[28:30.960 --> 28:37.120]  or for free on a case by case example and if it's some equipment or prosthesis or things
[28:37.120 --> 28:41.920]  you should approach a charity to come in and pay for it because this is a sacred honor
[28:41.920 --> 28:46.280]  to be a physician will you explain to them the old system and why Ron Paul pointed out
[28:46.280 --> 28:50.040]  nobody ever went without health care citizens just didn't know about it the illegal aliens
[28:50.040 --> 28:57.840]  all know about it well when I was in Madison you know for 40 years counting my residency
[28:57.840 --> 29:03.160]  we gave away millions of dollars of free care I got up in the middle of the night and operated
[29:03.160 --> 29:09.360]  all night long on people who were indigent or for whatever reason they didn't have money
[29:09.360 --> 29:13.920]  and we didn't charge them anything every Christmas we would go through our bills and we would
[29:13.920 --> 29:18.160]  find elderly people who were trying to pay their bills off a little bit at a time we
[29:18.160 --> 29:25.840]  would cancel their bills we used to give insurance only we would tell patients if they had difficulty
[29:25.840 --> 29:32.240]  paying the charge out of pocket we would say well we'll just accept it and stay there let's
[29:32.240 --> 29:36.720]  explain what the old good medicine was that's now been taken over the last 30 years now
[29:36.720 --> 29:43.160]  converting to pure eugenics based death medicine death panels they now brag the government runs

[33:24.880 --> 33:29.720]  I'm wearing for the state I'm a highway patrol you know it really hit me yesterday when I
[33:29.720 --> 33:33.320]  got pulled over for reportedly going eight miles over the speed limit I'm gonna challenge
[33:33.320 --> 33:41.200]  the ticket of course it's all fraud anyways and the guys said shine here and I didn't
[33:41.200 --> 33:45.320]  have my latest insurance card even though their computer showed I had insurance they
[33:45.320 --> 33:50.800]  gave me a ticket for that too and I was just thinking you know they make you buy car insurance
[33:50.800 --> 33:56.880]  but then they let the illegal aliens be exempt and it just really hit me that now I've got
[33:56.880 --> 34:02.400]  to go buy health care even though I already have insurance and now obviously it's written
[34:02.400 --> 34:08.320]  by the insurance companies it's gonna go up in price and they get to charge you more for
[34:08.320 --> 34:13.760]  less procedures and also make sure the doctors in the medical facility get less of that money
[34:13.760 --> 34:18.560]  so they might charge you a million bucks pretty soon to put a bandaid on you and this is what
[34:18.560 --> 34:23.720]  happens in every communist or socialist or collective system and why is Bill Gates and
[34:23.720 --> 34:27.600]  Warren Buffett supporting it well they're taking over health care and they admit it's

[36:51.840 --> 36:55.800]  not really at that price that just pays for the bandwidth in our growing media platform
[36:55.800 --> 37:01.120]  PrisonPlanet.tv okay Dr. Blullock this is a long segment I want to try to shut up and
[37:01.120 --> 37:05.840]  give you the floor here you know for some large spaces to finish up where you see we're
[37:05.840 --> 37:11.320]  going and ways to hopefully reverse Obamacare because they lied and said it will not increase
[37:11.320 --> 37:16.840]  premiums obviously it would immediately because it was written by the insurance companies
[37:16.840 --> 37:22.280]  and where you see all this going ways to fight it and then I want to segue into suddenly
[37:22.280 --> 37:30.800]  ABC News CBN you name it about coconut oil that you wrote about I don't know 20 years
[37:30.800 --> 37:35.640]  ago or whatever and and and other types of good fats and what they're doing for the
[37:35.640 --> 37:41.780]  brains and you know the fact that so many of these disorders we see are really just
[37:41.780 --> 37:47.720]  nutrient deficiencies and some of that information because it's something that people can really
[37:47.720 --> 37:56.800]  do right now yeah go back to the Obamacare what's coming you know the interesting thing
[37:56.800 --> 38:03.560]  when I first read through the Obamacare thing that struck me is that it really says specifically
[38:03.560 --> 38:12.360]  very little what it does is it refers to literally tens of thousands of other federal documents
[38:12.360 --> 38:19.000]  rules and regulation and it leads a lot to arbitrary change after the law is enacted
[38:19.000 --> 38:25.320]  now what's coming is and you got to remember when Hillary first tried to create this system
[38:25.320 --> 38:33.320]  when her husband was the president she met with all the major pharmaceutical CEO in secret
[38:33.320 --> 38:38.840]  because they were going to make a killing out of nationalizing healthcare because they
[38:38.840 --> 38:44.520]  would be the sole supplier of all medicines all over the United States no one else could
[38:44.520 --> 38:50.280]  would be allowed to supply these medications that would get rid of their competition the
[38:50.280 --> 38:56.480]  same thing holds here and what we're going to see is that the manufacturers of vaccines
[38:56.480 --> 39:00.640]  that have been anointed that were anointed during the age one in one are going to be
[39:00.640 --> 39:07.520]  told are going to tell the public in order to receive this care you have to have all
[39:07.520 --> 39:11.720]  your vaccinations up to date by the way they're already doing that as you know with medical
[39:11.720 --> 39:16.880]  workers and it goes to the hospital but they're already saying if you want your welfare check
[39:16.880 --> 39:22.520]  you've got to get all the shots so this is forced government medicine medical training
[39:22.520 --> 39:31.320]  exactly and it's all designed to control people so if you go to your doctor for say a carpal
[39:31.320 --> 39:36.520]  tunnel problem you're going to be told well we looked at your record and you haven't had
[39:36.520 --> 39:42.280]  your meningococcal vaccine this year so you're going to have to get it or you can't be treated
[39:42.280 --> 39:48.800]  so everyone now is going to be forced vaccinated the companies like Merck and Novartis are
[39:48.800 --> 39:54.920]  going to make fortunes if you're a vaccinating every human being in the United States and
[39:54.920 --> 40:00.080]  eventually they plan for the entire world unbelievable there you'll be told what you
[40:00.080 --> 40:06.720]  can eat what you cannot eat you'll be told when to exercise how much exercise to do you're
[40:06.720 --> 40:12.000]  going to be told you have to take statins you have to take antihypertensive medications
[40:12.000 --> 40:16.840]  the children will be placed on these medications this is already being discussed they were
[40:16.840 --> 40:22.240]  even talking about putting these medications in the water supply to force everyone to be
[40:22.240 --> 40:26.080]  on these medications whether they wanted to or not and by the way as you're talking I
[40:26.080 --> 40:30.880]  just can't help it but and everything you're talking about is already being phased in with
[40:30.880 --> 40:35.160]  the mayor of New York saying what you can drink what you can eat with with Michelle Obama
[40:35.160 --> 40:40.040]  my kids were going to private school part time and even this Christian school two days
[40:40.040 --> 40:45.960]  a week as an academy for home schoolers it was big they were accredited so they had to
[40:45.960 --> 40:50.360]  do workbooks on Michelle Obama telling him what was healthy but she doesn't tell you
[40:50.360 --> 40:57.320]  GMO or aspartame is bad or MSG she tells you you get 850 calories a day and the kids are
[40:57.320 --> 41:00.960]  literally starving I'm sorry it's just it's just they're now doing forced inoculations
[41:00.960 --> 41:06.880]  in California without parental consent everything you're saying is already starting yeah well
[41:06.880 --> 41:12.240]  they have a very incremental program to get the public used to it and they've done an
[41:12.240 --> 41:19.320]  incredible brainwashing of the public on the necessity of vaccination for herd immunity
[41:19.320 --> 41:26.760]  herd immunity is a complete fraud and approved it no one's challenged it so what they're
[41:26.760 --> 41:33.120]  doing they're building the case that for the public health we have to force people to receive
[41:33.120 --> 41:38.760]  all of these vaccines well it's been shown they have over 125 vaccines that they're planning
[41:38.760 --> 41:44.840]  to make mandatory this is huge profits for these companies and it's going to destroy
[41:44.840 --> 41:52.200]  the health of tens of millions of Americans and as you get older and you get these vaccines
[41:52.200 --> 41:57.440]  and your health begins to rapidly deteriorate guess what you're not going to be allowed
[41:57.440 --> 42:01.360]  to get healthcare that you think you're going to get because you're going to be on the list
[42:01.360 --> 42:08.040]  of people that's too old to get these you're done so you're going to be left to die there's
[42:08.040 --> 42:13.760]  your death panels now all of this has been talked about on the the healthcare sites in
[42:13.760 --> 42:20.000]  these tax-free foundations for almost half a century people just have not been reading
[42:20.000 --> 42:26.160]  it they're not paying attention you brought up so many of these things to the public you
[42:26.160 --> 42:35.440]  read these documents you dig these things out but unfortunately it sounds so outlandish
[42:35.440 --> 42:41.800]  and crazy and conspiratorial people just can't bring themselves to believe it and it's like
[42:41.800 --> 42:47.880]  c.s. Lewis and in his book the screw tape letters he said the devil's greatest weapon
[42:47.880 --> 42:52.600]  is that people don't believe in it well the collectives and the socialists and the communists
[42:52.600 --> 42:56.640]  greatest weapon is that you don't believe they're going to do these nefarious things
[42:56.640 --> 43:01.120]  well yeah they now laugh and say there's no such thing as socialism or communism anymore
[43:01.120 --> 43:07.120]  even though it's taking over the whole planet well what they do is they do word play they
[43:07.120 --> 43:15.000]  say this is not socialism well and I and a technical definition and previous definitions
[43:15.000 --> 43:21.280]  of socialism it's not for socialism is the nationalization of all businesses and industry
[43:21.280 --> 43:31.000]  the new socialism which was Antonio Grancy's idea and late and later Saul Alinsky's popularized
[43:31.000 --> 43:36.360]  it was that we don't actually take over the company we just regulate it and we regulate
[43:36.360 --> 43:41.880]  how much it produces how much it plays as employees what is their work hours what exactly
[43:41.880 --> 43:45.880]  the communists can't ever run anything but a death can so they just sit back and you
[43:45.880 --> 43:51.080]  run your operation and they siphon it off and tell you what to do that's exactly right
[43:51.080 --> 43:55.320]  that's what national socialism was that's what fascism and Italy was and that's what
[43:55.320 --> 44:00.920]  we have today was called corporatism now if you look back in the history of collectivism
[44:00.920 --> 44:05.640]  it was based on the corporate model they love the corporation because the corporation has
[44:05.640 --> 44:11.480]  an elite board that makes all the decision regiments all of its employees controls all
[44:11.480 --> 44:16.480]  the systems and everything within the corporation and they said what we need to do is produce
[44:16.480 --> 44:24.160]  a corporate America and then a corporate world in which a giant corporation rules everything
[44:24.160 --> 44:28.720]  everybody thinks this is government taking over corporations no it's just the opposite
[44:28.720 --> 44:32.840]  is corporations taking over the government because what you have is council and foreign
[44:32.840 --> 44:37.880]  relations look at the list of people in council and foreign relations is the CEOs and directors
[44:37.880 --> 44:45.120]  of every major corporation in the United States look at the trilateral commission same thing
[44:45.120 --> 44:51.160]  all the major international corporations and financial houses look at Bilderberg same list
[44:51.160 --> 44:57.440]  same people and it's all corporate now the dream of the Rockefellers was that we would
[44:57.440 --> 45:03.280]  create a corporate control of the United States they look at government they said government
[45:03.280 --> 45:09.240]  is inefficient and this is the whole essence of collectivism is efficiency well efficiency
[45:09.240 --> 45:15.040]  means making people do what they don't want to do taking their freedom away we know best
[45:15.040 --> 45:20.840]  as an elite they say what you need to do where you need to be where you need to live what
[45:20.840 --> 45:26.760]  your occupation should be what you should eat when you should die if you should live
[45:26.760 --> 45:32.080]  this is what socialism collectivism is and as you if you pay close attention to what
[45:32.080 --> 45:37.000]  they're saying that's what they're telling you we're the smart people we know how to
[45:37.000 --> 45:44.400]  engineer society society's chaotic under capitalism and freedom we can't stand this chaos anymore
[45:44.400 --> 45:50.920]  we need to have social engineering and social control and that's what all of this is about
[45:50.920 --> 45:56.520]  how do we find it how do we resist them I mean one thing is I'm trying to exercise more I
[45:56.520 --> 46:00.280]  become a workaholic and gained a lot of weight and got unhealthy I'm reversing that by the
[46:00.280 --> 46:08.160]  grace of God I mean I guess we we get healthy and we exercise and we really get the proper
[46:08.160 --> 46:13.520]  nutrition understanding that there's not going to be a medical system to go to soon
[46:13.520 --> 46:18.920]  and this isn't a joke I mean Paul Watson's worked for me 10 years this this year it's
[46:18.920 --> 46:27.120]  10 years great shape jogs you know 3% body fat lives in England riding you know for
[46:27.120 --> 46:34.080]  us and I told you the story last time you were on doc for a month he he had some type
[46:34.080 --> 46:39.560]  of strep and cold couldn't get over it had been into the doctor waited two weeks to get
[46:39.560 --> 46:43.440]  in I couldn't imagine having to wait two weeks a few times I really had to go and I'm like
[46:43.440 --> 46:49.880]  get me in there now when you're coughing up blood I mean it was rough and then two weeks
[46:49.880 --> 46:53.880]  into what he finally got in and they gave him a little pack with some aspirin and some
[46:53.880 --> 47:00.040]  Advil and some Tylenol and some lozenges and and some you know Kleenex and stuff and you
[47:00.040 --> 47:03.720]  said I guess in the military that's what you gave you I got a lot of emails about that
[47:03.720 --> 47:07.600]  that's what they say they give you the military there wasn't like when I go to a private clinic
[47:07.600 --> 47:11.880]  boom I'm in in 20 minutes they swab the throat they say we'll call you in two hours and tell
[47:11.880 --> 47:16.680]  you what the prescription is because if it's bacterial or viral they got to find out you
[47:16.680 --> 47:20.560]  know these quack doctors you go to me just give you antibiotics don't even check but
[47:20.560 --> 47:24.360]  you know the clinics places I go they do I couldn't imagine that and then I said why
[47:24.360 --> 47:28.440]  don't you go to private doctors I said I know you have those he goes listen Alex you've
[47:28.440 --> 47:34.320]  got to get permission from the government clinic to then go to the private physician
[47:34.320 --> 47:38.720]  I mean this is total control I'm sorry to tell that story again but this is the this
[47:38.720 --> 47:46.160]  is total tyranny was an example of the regimentation you're not an individual the enemy of collectivism
[47:46.160 --> 47:51.960]  is the individual you read all of the literature on the philosophy of this socialism communism
[47:51.960 --> 47:58.440]  Marxism Leninism fascism national socialism it's always the same the enemy is the individual
[47:58.440 --> 48:03.280]  they don't recognize individual they recognize collectives your number your social security
[48:03.280 --> 48:09.200]  number you're some other kind of number and if we have to deny you care if you die waiting
[48:09.200 --> 48:15.000]  for care it's no big deal you were just a number and people are not used to that in
[48:15.000 --> 48:22.560]  the United States you know as a Christian we recognize individuals God recognizes individuals
[48:22.560 --> 48:27.480]  and you know you say what can we do well number one we've got a restraint in our faith they
[48:27.480 --> 48:33.880]  have spent enormous efforts to convince people there's no God that Jesus is not the son of
[48:33.880 --> 48:41.520]  God and so they've destroyed the faith base of our of the foundation of our country we
[48:41.520 --> 48:47.200]  need to reestablish that number one of over everything else we can improve our health
[48:47.200 --> 48:53.120]  so that if we are forcibly vaccinated we're not likely to have the devastating reactions
[48:53.120 --> 49:00.120]  to these vaccines we know how to do that now we know how to improve health of the elderly
[49:00.120 --> 49:06.360]  so that they don't get sick they are seriously ill like they do now many of the neurodegenerative
[49:06.360 --> 49:14.760]  diseases can be prevented by proper exercise and use of nutrients and diet the other thing
[49:14.760 --> 49:19.880]  that we can do is nullification that is the most important weapon we have left the vote
[49:19.880 --> 49:26.760]  has been taken away by voter fraud so no matter how you vote they're going to cheat change
[49:26.760 --> 49:33.000]  the machine change the vote get people in that are illegal to vote etc so what the states
[49:33.000 --> 49:38.440]  have left is the state can nullify laws by passing its own state laws and in if you're
[49:38.440 --> 49:44.360]  in a court if you're on a jury and it's a federal case an IRS case against a citizen
[49:44.360 --> 49:49.760]  or an EPA case or one of these medical cases and you're on the jury you can nullify by
[49:49.760 --> 49:55.200]  voting not guilty no matter what the evidence shows that's that is the law of the land
[49:55.200 --> 49:59.880]  of the constitution and this was established in the beginning of the united states because
[49:59.880 --> 50:05.880]  the courts had judges that were british and american juries you know god bless you i don't
[50:05.880 --> 50:09.280]  know if you heard this a month ago but it made national news i've called for the second
[50:09.280 --> 50:13.640]  american revolution to use the declaration of independence to not create a new country
[50:13.640 --> 50:20.320]  but to remove the globalist and reinstate the republic it's an instant download reupload
[50:20.320 --> 50:24.120]  and what you're saying is so true there's election fraud obama didn't really win i'm
[50:24.120 --> 50:27.680]  not saying romney was good either he wrote obama care for the globalist the point is
[50:27.680 --> 50:33.400]  it was all fixed only admitting that we're under real authoritarianism that now plans
[50:33.400 --> 50:38.880]  to mop us up only admitting how much trouble we're in will beat them the minute we understand
[50:38.880 --> 50:44.480]  they're lying criminal authoritarians hell bent on on on enslaving us we turn the tide
[50:44.480 --> 50:48.720]  you agree with that statement dr blaylock exactly you can't compromise with evil these
[50:48.720 --> 50:54.040]  are evil people they have evil intention so this this nonsense of the republican party
[50:54.040 --> 50:59.080]  saying oh well our problem is we have too many conservatives oh god bless you i want
[50:59.080 --> 51:05.320]  to hear exactly we're gonna talk about that strategic relocation is a systematic way to

[54:12.440 --> 54:15.520]  blaylock and then we're going to go to your phone calls those of you patiently holding
[54:15.520 --> 54:21.720]  and then into all the other news i haven't gotten to yet but harry bellafonte went on
[54:21.720 --> 54:27.440]  al sharpton show and said we should quote just lock people up we should just round up
[54:27.440 --> 54:33.880]  the republicans and like third world dictators do and quote throw them in jail and that's
[54:33.880 --> 54:37.520]  exactly what the weatherman came out in federal court were planning to do the people that
[54:37.520 --> 54:42.720]  advised obama you see i've studied these people and just like dr blaylock was just saying
[54:42.720 --> 54:48.760]  this stuff all sounds crazy it's because truth is strange with the fiction and the very same
[54:48.760 --> 54:54.040]  cruise and the science is that the nazis and the soviets and the mall issues are now being
[54:54.040 --> 54:58.480]  used here i've talked to so many former eastern europeans who are successful businessmen and
[54:58.480 --> 55:04.920]  women who fled here in the 70s and 80s and they are so freaked out they're scared for
[55:04.920 --> 55:10.800]  america because they say i have seen this i have heard this this is a this is a blueprint
[55:10.800 --> 55:16.440]  and exactly what dr blaylock said folks we've got to really understand this is war this isn't
[55:16.440 --> 55:21.080]  just some boss hog corruption taken over these are vicious control freaks anything else on
[55:21.080 --> 55:25.360]  that subject dr blaylock and then some basic facts on why do you think it's starting to
[55:25.360 --> 55:31.320]  come out that so many of the all timer problems are the statin drugs and the lack of good
[55:31.320 --> 55:39.440]  oils well yeah you know the hair bellifani's and these people making these statements they're
[55:39.440 --> 55:47.200]  been empowered by the rise of the lap the left is seeing and flexing its muscles because
[55:47.200 --> 55:52.760]  they're seeing that they're they're winning essentially and they're winning by stealing
[55:52.760 --> 56:00.840]  elections now what we need to do is as i say use the power of nullification on juries
[56:00.840 --> 56:06.600]  you could protect your fellow citizen against these abuses by the federal government just
[56:06.600 --> 56:14.520]  serve on a jury now the judge cannot direct you how to vote people should get intimidated
[56:14.520 --> 56:18.160]  because they said well the judge gave us instructions well he can instruct all day
[56:18.160 --> 56:22.440]  long so jury nullification elaborating on that point you made before the break though
[56:22.440 --> 56:26.680]  and then we'll get into the other issue briefly here when you you know talk about republicans
[56:26.680 --> 56:31.240]  that that is waving the white flag when they were always part of the establishment to say
[56:31.240 --> 56:35.720]  we need to accept socialism and you know glenn bet comes out and says we need to push you
[56:35.720 --> 56:40.600]  know basically gay marriage or whatever because you know we need to be like the democrats that's
[56:40.600 --> 56:46.600]  how we'll win that's all football issues anyways my point is that's that's a total capitulation
[56:46.600 --> 56:50.280]  and then the left says oh great look we're totally taking over they're going to give
[56:50.280 --> 56:55.920]  into us well yes and then and once you yield in one area they'll just force you to yield
[56:55.920 --> 56:59.800]  in another i mean all they have to do is make something else unpopular they have to make
[56:59.800 --> 57:04.520]  the fact that you you want to own property unpopular make the fact that you want to own
[57:04.520 --> 57:08.720]  a gun and protect your family unpopular make the fact that you want to choose your own
[57:08.720 --> 57:14.320]  food and grow a garden in your yard unpopular and then with each case we're going to compromise
[57:14.320 --> 57:20.160]  what we've seen over the last 75 years is we're always compromising towards the left
[57:20.160 --> 57:24.480]  there's never a compromise toward the right we always to the left now those of us that
[57:24.480 --> 57:31.040]  are a lot older what we know is that if you look back in 1950s when I was growing up if
[57:31.040 --> 57:35.040]  any of these things were even discussed back then people would laugh at you say there's
[57:35.040 --> 57:40.040]  no way the American people would allow that you got to be crazy so if you go back in time
[57:40.040 --> 57:45.720]  and a time capsule they would laugh you out of the room and now the official army manuals
[57:45.720 --> 57:49.720]  as we pull those up I want to give the number say they're now preparing quote reeducation
[57:49.720 --> 57:55.840]  centers doctor they even use the Soviet term exactly that this is what's so shocking is
[57:55.840 --> 58:01.840]  they even use the terminology that's used by KGB and the Chica from the Soviet Union
[58:01.840 --> 58:07.720]  they don't even have any qualms about using this terminology now because they feel well
[58:07.720 --> 58:12.520]  we've won there's nothing they can do they've lost the battle and we're going to implement
[58:12.520 --> 58:19.960]  our programs against their will that this government today is using executive power more
[58:19.960 --> 58:26.560]  than any president has ever dreamed of even FDR so the president won't even let Congress
[58:26.560 --> 58:32.360]  see his secret executive order on cyber security why even have a Congress stay there five more
[58:32.360 --> 58:36.280]  minutes with Dr. Blalock and he's going to get into some of the oils and the fact that
[58:36.280 --> 58:44.040]  what he's been talking about forever is now becoming mainstream which is some good news

[01:03:11.560 --> 01:03:15.280]  Lindsay think that they're going to try to manipulate that price lower so that the elite

[01:08:22.120 --> 01:08:28.560]  well fox sports columnist that we've covered in the first hour has come out and said you
[01:08:28.560 --> 01:08:35.480]  are a member of the kkk if you're in the nr a or a gun owner and has called for the band
[01:08:35.480 --> 01:08:41.840]  of firearms for the american people bob costas as you know then went and quoted him and said
[01:08:41.840 --> 01:08:48.480]  he quote agreed with everything that he had said and then read it word for word off of
[01:08:48.480 --> 01:08:54.440]  a teleprompter all of that news is up at info wars dot com and present one dot com with
[01:08:54.440 --> 01:09:04.520]  the video and the audio of all of it and the establishment thinks you're so dumb that the
[01:09:04.520 --> 01:09:11.400]  republicans have come out with nine hundred and sixty billion in tax increases on the
[01:09:11.400 --> 01:09:22.920]  middle class the six hundred billion in deduction of the deductions and the obama care three
[01:09:22.920 --> 01:09:34.240]  point eight percent tax on investments investments and that means your 401k unbelievable and that's
[01:09:34.240 --> 01:09:39.560]  being called conservative that's the compromise obama wants dictatorial power to have congress
[01:09:39.560 --> 01:09:42.840]  just sound away the power of the purse to him when he's already operating like that
[01:09:42.840 --> 01:09:48.720]  on so many fronts they're all just complete fronts and here is max keiser with this big
[01:09:48.720 --> 01:09:54.920]  front page in the mighty london independent max keiser barack obama is clueless bit romney
[01:09:54.920 --> 01:10:02.240]  will bankrupt the country and that's exactly what he actually said back in november and
[01:10:02.240 --> 01:10:07.480]  he wants to talk some about this article but he he obviously predicted that obama would
[01:10:07.480 --> 01:10:13.920]  be the winner but i mean to say that obama is clueless and we know max max doesn't really
[01:10:13.920 --> 01:10:21.200]  really believe that and that's robert chambers or calmers saying that we're gonna get a former
[01:10:21.200 --> 01:10:25.960]  rebel now retired stockbroker top stockbroker inventor of the hollywood stock exchange virtual
[01:10:25.960 --> 01:10:29.640]  trading specialist used a lot of stock markets in the world today and it really needs no
[01:10:29.640 --> 01:10:35.320]  introduction here but so much is going on here's interesting when the clatchy newspapers
[01:10:35.320 --> 01:10:41.800]  i just can't get over this headline al-qaeda link groups syrian rebels once denied now
[01:10:41.800 --> 01:10:46.880]  key to anti Assad victories and they admit our government's giving service to air missiles
[01:10:46.880 --> 01:10:51.720]  to al-qaeda that they're the groups making people suicide bomb or they kill their families
[01:10:51.720 --> 01:10:55.960]  and this is the height of morality now but i've got to get my rights up or al-qaeda will
[01:10:55.960 --> 01:11:00.800]  kill me and here's some of the other news tsa seeks permission to conduct safety assessments
[01:11:00.800 --> 01:11:06.240]  on highways tsa is creating and maintaining a watch list of americans who violate its policies
[01:11:06.240 --> 01:11:12.360]  breaking the whole tray von martin situation now with the bloody photos why did the media
[01:11:12.360 --> 01:11:16.680]  cover that up in the government because they want to get racial division in this country
[01:11:16.680 --> 01:11:22.120]  that is just some of what we've got and then dealing with the financial fiscal cliff that
[01:11:22.120 --> 01:11:29.000]  max keiser has been talking about earlier i read the headlines out of england i'm looking
[01:11:29.000 --> 01:11:34.680]  for that article right now where the bank of england had said this is like a world war
[01:11:34.680 --> 01:11:39.960]  it is so bad and basically said there's no way to pay things off here it is actually
[01:11:39.960 --> 01:11:46.600]  found we can document cam shot this for tv viewers this is as bad as a world war bank
[01:11:46.600 --> 01:11:53.600]  of england bosses grim view of financial crisis which has left a debt that will be paid by
[01:11:53.600 --> 01:11:59.240]  our grandchildren it's not meant to be paid it's mega banks putting out derivatives that
[01:11:59.240 --> 01:12:05.080]  we then back up with the fellow reserve europe's in the same thing 40 billion a month paid directly
[01:12:05.080 --> 01:12:09.680]  to the private shareholders of the fellow reserve jp morgan chase goldman sacks and others
[01:12:09.680 --> 01:12:16.160]  and now we're hearing the head of jp morgan chase who ran disgusting ads during the football
[01:12:16.160 --> 01:12:24.560]  on thanksgiving literally saying jp morgan chase brought you thanksgiving and free markets
[01:12:24.560 --> 01:12:28.160]  when they're one of the biggest recipients of corporate welfare you can see their plan
[01:12:28.160 --> 01:12:35.960]  global banker occupation you can see it all now totally face and we have now entered the
[01:12:35.960 --> 01:12:44.680]  la la land max keiser where on earth are we going break down the points i've made because
[01:12:44.680 --> 01:12:49.200]  you've said that you believe by april that's now only three or four months away that it's
[01:12:49.200 --> 01:12:54.440]  going to be clear that we're in a full bore collapse what is your overall take since
[01:12:54.440 --> 01:13:01.480]  you were on a month ago oh yeah five five months away to april am i holding to my prediction
[01:13:01.480 --> 01:13:10.560]  alex jones that you will have a catastrophic event and the question was what would be the
[01:13:10.560 --> 01:13:15.440]  trigger you know on on this show your show we talk about the potential trigger points
[01:13:15.440 --> 01:13:20.240]  and one that i mentioned a couple of months ago which is now on the radar of a lot of
[01:13:20.240 --> 01:13:26.000]  people is in japan because japan has the worst debt situation in the world and they're bringing
[01:13:26.000 --> 01:13:31.080]  in a new government in a couple of weeks who has publicly stated that he wants to bring
[01:13:31.080 --> 01:13:39.160]  in a quadrillion in yen printing and he wants to kill the japanese yen which would possibly
[01:13:39.160 --> 01:13:46.040]  be the first of the g7 nations to enter into a hyperinflationary currency collapse so i'm
[01:13:46.040 --> 01:13:50.600]  i'm you know that's kind of where i'm putting my chips right now i think the the global
[01:13:50.600 --> 01:13:56.920]  currency collapse could start in japan and i'm sticking to my my timeline of the next
[01:13:56.920 --> 01:14:00.320]  five months i want to point your attention direct your attention to something that just
[01:14:00.320 --> 01:14:05.600]  came out a couple of weeks a couple of days ago in switzerland now they've introduced negative
[01:14:05.600 --> 01:14:10.640]  interest rates this is something i predicted on your show and a couple of others i predicted
[01:14:10.640 --> 01:14:16.320]  for you know a year ago or so and so if you keep your money in a swiss bank they charge
[01:14:16.320 --> 01:14:22.160]  you to keep your money in a swiss bank it's a negative interest rate this this is a form
[01:14:22.160 --> 01:14:26.760]  of a capital control they don't want people putting their money into switzerland so if
[01:14:26.760 --> 01:14:31.320]  you're trying to escape let's say you're a japanese yen investor and you're trying to
[01:14:31.320 --> 01:14:35.480]  escape the yen and you want to put your money in switzerland the swiss the swiss government
[01:14:35.480 --> 01:14:41.600]  will charge you to keep your money in a swiss money market or a cash account and right now
[01:14:41.600 --> 01:14:46.280]  there are six countries in europe that charge negative interest rates with switzerland charging
[01:14:46.280 --> 01:14:51.520]  a negative up to a half a percentage point to a point on two-year paper and there's five
[01:14:51.520 --> 01:14:55.680]  other countries that offer negative interest rates so this idea of putting your money some
[01:14:55.680 --> 01:14:59.720]  place where it's going to be safe well these countries have figured this out and they're
[01:14:59.720 --> 01:15:04.680]  charging you to keep your money in the bank so not only do you have inflation to deal
[01:15:04.680 --> 01:15:10.740]  with but you have the fact that the banks are now openly confiscating your money using
[01:15:10.740 --> 01:15:15.520]  negative interest rates this of course will come to the united states soon enough and
[01:15:15.520 --> 01:15:22.440]  so it'll come to the uk as well so here's another big story from just breaking which
[01:15:22.440 --> 01:15:27.600]  is part of what we talked about on your show before you know corrections core of america
[01:15:27.600 --> 01:15:33.000]  the company that is the biggest private prison operator in america the company that just did
[01:15:33.000 --> 01:15:38.440]  a deal with 48 states in america saying that will take your prison business from you and
[01:15:38.440 --> 01:15:43.440]  will run your prisons if you guarantee 98 percent occupancy that is to say you put people in
[01:15:43.440 --> 01:15:49.160]  prison well it just came out that corrections core of america is using gangs to run their
[01:15:49.160 --> 01:15:54.840]  prisons so this is like a gang pauncey scheme where the gangs run the prisons to go out
[01:15:54.840 --> 01:15:59.560]  to go and put more gangs in prison to run the prison and then they rotate them out back
[01:15:59.560 --> 01:16:04.040]  on the street to be protected by the police the certain groups to run the drugs to wander
[01:16:04.040 --> 01:16:07.760]  it back through the mega banks publicly who've been caught and don't get in trouble who then
[01:16:07.760 --> 01:16:13.840]  own the subsidiary private prisons so it's an absolute full spectrum dominance program
[01:16:13.840 --> 01:16:18.560]  and you can buy stock in corrections core of america and you know the elites that lindsay
[01:16:18.560 --> 01:16:23.040]  williams talks about i mean they buy stock in corrections core of america so they it's
[01:16:23.040 --> 01:16:28.640]  like buying stock on a plantation from antebellum south if you wanted to buy or buying stock in
[01:16:28.640 --> 01:16:32.400]  ashwitz hey wouldn't that be a great idea you could buy stock in ashwitz of course i'm
[01:16:32.400 --> 01:16:36.240]  i'm sure if golden sacks had an opportunity they would take ashwitz public with well actually
[01:16:36.240 --> 01:16:40.040]  a lot of the mega banks did fund hitler as you know and then and then people like my
[01:16:40.040 --> 01:16:46.080]  grandfather they weren't allowed to bomb whole sectors that had forward and gm factories
[01:16:46.080 --> 01:16:51.320]  and slave camps so because the war was a huge profit on both sides and let's take a look
[01:16:51.320 --> 01:16:57.480]  at the global debt situation since we were on last the g7 countries they've moved from
[01:16:57.480 --> 01:17:05.480]  being having a debt to gdp of 375 percent a debt to gdp ratios now at 415 percent debt
[01:17:05.480 --> 01:17:12.200]  to gdp ratio and here's here's the really the the the story and and the the methodology
[01:17:12.200 --> 01:17:19.640]  in the psychosis ben bernanke talks about deflation and he therefore jack's interest
[01:17:19.640 --> 01:17:25.680]  rates add to near zero percent in fact by putting interest rates near zero percent he
[01:17:25.680 --> 01:17:30.960]  causes deflation he causes now the insurance industry has stated that because interest
[01:17:30.960 --> 01:17:35.400]  rates are so low they can no longer operate as insurance companies if you don't have insurance
[01:17:35.400 --> 01:17:38.840]  you don't have private property you don't have private property you don't have capitalism
[01:17:38.840 --> 01:17:42.400]  so the insurance industry is not saying we can't operate with this low interest rate
[01:17:42.400 --> 01:17:47.000]  environment so that's the form of deflation the wages are getting completely scrubbed
[01:17:47.000 --> 01:17:50.680]  it hasn't been any wage growth in years that's a form of deflation and so bernanke says we're
[01:17:50.680 --> 01:17:54.600]  going to lower interest rates to fight deflation but in fact by lowering interest rates he's
[01:17:54.600 --> 01:18:01.920]  guaranteeing in deflation at the same time he is creating and this is a remarkable statistic
[01:18:01.920 --> 01:18:10.360]  the bond market in america is at a 240 year high the bond market in the united kingdom
[01:18:10.360 --> 01:18:17.080]  is at a 300 year high never have bonds in 300 years in this country united kingdom have
[01:18:17.080 --> 01:18:21.600]  been hired and they are now or in 240 years in america than they are right now that is
[01:18:21.600 --> 01:18:26.000]  a classic bubble when people say well what about this idea that interest rates are going
[01:18:26.000 --> 01:18:29.920]  to go higher interest rates are going to go higher when this bond bubble collapses and
[01:18:29.920 --> 01:18:34.040]  this is part of what i'm saying in the next five months the trigger that will create the
[01:18:34.040 --> 01:18:38.920]  cascade the domino effect probably starting in japan toward a global sovereign bond collapse
[01:18:38.920 --> 01:18:44.440]  which means interest rates which are the inverse of a bond price go up dramatically and that's
[01:18:44.440 --> 01:18:51.440]  your why is the bank of england head saying this is armageddon well they are in a very
[01:18:51.440 --> 01:18:54.960]  hard he's now leaving a merman king is on the way out they're bringing this canadian
[01:18:54.960 --> 01:18:58.880]  in you know here's a perfect example we talk about the new world order the fact that you
[01:18:58.880 --> 01:19:03.120]  can just plug and play and take a canadian central banker and stick it into a british
[01:19:03.120 --> 01:19:08.600]  institution the bank of england without anyone questioning well why it who are they answering
[01:19:08.600 --> 01:19:11.920]  to they're not they're not answering to the sovereign which they work they're answering
[01:19:11.920 --> 01:19:16.880]  to a global banking establishment if you can just take the canadian central banker put
[01:19:16.880 --> 01:19:20.440]  him into london then they're going to take who's going to who's going to fill the london
[01:19:20.440 --> 01:19:24.520]  central the canadian central bank that'll probably be somebody from the global banking
[01:19:24.520 --> 01:19:28.960]  establishment that's like that's like ireland it's like greece it's like italy they just
[01:19:28.960 --> 01:19:33.680]  a point not just the bankers but the presidents and prime ministers now and then brag we're
[01:19:33.680 --> 01:19:37.720]  in a world government in hundreds of newspapers but then have the southern bowery law center
[01:19:37.720 --> 01:19:42.240]  say you're a terrorist if you talk about it and they tell the police and training manuals
[01:19:42.240 --> 01:19:45.440]  none of it exists and the cops are like the general public don't even want to tie their
[01:19:45.440 --> 01:19:50.920]  shoelaces they believe it i mean it is and the government runs al-qaeda publicly and
[01:19:50.920 --> 01:19:55.080]  i've got to give my rights up if i'm downtown shooting video cops come over and say you
[01:19:55.080 --> 01:19:59.440]  can't videotape you might be al-qaeda while the government runs al-qaeda and the cop doesn't
[01:19:59.440 --> 01:20:04.600]  even know what continent he's on we'll be back we have witnessed two terrible storms
[01:20:04.600 --> 01:20:09.760]  in the east but we are still in the eye of the perfect storm the most devastating economic

[01:24:34.200 --> 01:24:39.720]  world order. Piers Morgan has called for a ban of all semi-autos on seeing an end seeing
[01:24:39.720 --> 01:24:47.960]  an anchor rance about gun control so there you go I mean you know and again it's amazing
[01:24:47.960 --> 01:24:55.040]  that this is what we live under that's up at infowars.com right now. Long segment coming
[01:24:55.040 --> 01:24:58.360]  up we're going to air a special report on the Second Amendment that Aaron and I put
[01:24:58.360 --> 01:25:03.000]  together and then go back to Max here with us and I'm excited to announce that Max is
[01:25:03.000 --> 01:25:08.280]  going to start doing 10 minute special reports for Info Wars Nightly News once a week as
[01:25:08.280 --> 01:25:11.680]  well as joining us a few times a month we're very honored to have him do that and I should
[01:25:11.680 --> 01:25:18.720]  add you should follow him at Twitter and also MaxKaiser.com and we're going to put it up
[01:25:18.720 --> 01:25:26.120]  on screen Max it's at Max Kaiser very very simple to follow you at Twitter and I'm real
[01:25:26.120 --> 01:25:30.720]  Alex Jones and I've got a at prison planet but I don't know why I don't have a at real
[01:25:30.720 --> 01:25:34.920]  Alex Jones we'll figure that out but at Max Kaiser everybody should follow him there for
[01:25:34.920 --> 01:25:40.520]  all the updates and I hope you're wrong but I do see massive preparations for this and
[01:25:40.520 --> 01:25:46.520]  look at this cops to Congress we need logs of Americans text messages seen at news guilty
[01:25:46.520 --> 01:25:52.200]  and deliberate innocent feds telling states to pass laws allowing highway checkpoints
[01:25:52.200 --> 01:25:59.160]  TSA announces highway checkpoints in all 50 states they're announcing capital controls
[01:25:59.160 --> 01:26:03.000]  that you won't be able to leave the country now if they say you owe money I mean this
[01:26:03.000 --> 01:26:08.720]  is becoming Nazi Germany Max Kaiser well it's not the capital controls it's not just even
[01:26:08.720 --> 01:26:15.800]  trying to leave money leave the country across borders is the central banks don't trust each
[01:26:15.800 --> 01:26:23.800]  other that's why the lending is not being made a lot of people are complaining that
[01:26:23.800 --> 01:26:29.160]  the banks are not lending enough to stimulate business because the banks are hoarding cash
[01:26:29.160 --> 01:26:34.760]  and they're hoarding cash because they don't trust each other because they know that credit
[01:26:34.760 --> 01:26:42.200]  freeze like in 2008 or a collapse as I'm predicting will come they need that money on hand to
[01:26:42.200 --> 01:26:46.640]  pay themselves basically and they don't they don't trust each other this is another reason
[01:26:46.640 --> 01:26:51.600]  why since 2009 the central banks have been buying gold this year they're gonna be buying
[01:26:51.600 --> 01:26:57.560]  over 500 tons of gold that's just the central banks also starting next year Alex the Basil
[01:26:57.560 --> 01:27:05.560]  agreement that will classify gold for banks as a tier one asset which means that you can
[01:27:05.560 --> 01:27:11.000]  borrow 100 cents on the dollar against gold that you own so another big buyer of gold
[01:27:11.000 --> 01:27:18.400]  in 2013 will be banks and China's doing it universities are doing it Soros is doing it
[01:27:18.400 --> 01:27:25.800]  while simultaneously bad mounting it I mean a lot of this for me signals a bull market
[01:27:25.800 --> 01:27:32.440]  in gold well China is due to surprise everybody when they announced their official reserve
[01:27:32.440 --> 01:27:37.760]  figures they officially had a thousand fifty one tons but now it's pretty much an open
[01:27:37.760 --> 01:27:42.400]  secret that they have at least three thousand tons they're the biggest gold producer in
[01:27:42.400 --> 01:27:46.520]  the world the biggest gold miner in the world none of the gold leaves China there was a report
[01:27:46.520 --> 01:27:51.840]  that came out a couple of weeks ago proving or suggesting or indicating that no gold bar
[01:27:51.840 --> 01:27:56.760]  circulating in the vaults of any of the banks around the world have any Chinese stamps on
[01:27:56.760 --> 01:28:01.000]  them because China does not let this gold leave China they're out all over the world
[01:28:01.000 --> 01:28:06.560]  accumulating gold they want to get enough gold in in house to give them protection against
[01:28:06.560 --> 01:28:12.200]  that huge reserve of dollars that they have a three trillion paper money reserves over
[01:28:12.200 --> 01:28:16.960]  a trillion of that massively hedging with gold and who else is doing that basically
[01:28:16.960 --> 01:28:22.920]  everybody well Mexico has increased the gold position by thousands of percentage points
[01:28:22.920 --> 01:28:28.200]  Korea's been buying gold at every central bank in the world now I may I know I make
[01:28:28.200 --> 01:28:34.120]  that I may know many of the central banks in the world are buying gold some are famously
[01:28:34.120 --> 01:28:38.320]  not buying gold like the Bank of England sold what about all the fake comes in I heard you
[01:28:38.320 --> 01:28:42.760]  talking about that five years ago it's surfacing in vaults and government and private central
[01:28:42.760 --> 01:28:47.560]  banks everywhere well when the paper money collapses you know tungsten is not that bad
[01:28:47.560 --> 01:28:52.880]  thing to have you know I mean anything that's not paper is going to be valuable against
[01:28:52.880 --> 01:28:59.320]  a paper money apocalypse that's coming but the the tungsten has been an issue for years
[01:28:59.320 --> 01:29:04.760]  and years I mean I it's one of the another concern I mean you need to keep your head
[01:29:04.760 --> 01:29:09.040]  up and make sure you know my point is the gold covered tungsten is surfacing everywhere
[01:29:09.040 --> 01:29:17.040]  the big gold market and it's not enough of an issue to alter the these big trends that
[01:29:17.040 --> 01:29:23.040]  we're seeing no no I understand I'm just saying that shows that these western banks don't
[01:29:23.040 --> 01:29:27.200]  have as much gold as they said they have well the bigger problem is that they've leased
[01:29:27.200 --> 01:29:31.800]  it out that this is why a lot of the gold in central banks vaults that they've leased
[01:29:31.800 --> 01:29:37.400]  out now there's a big question mark whether that gold is actually there they cannot contrast
[01:29:37.400 --> 01:29:42.720]  this with what we saw in the United States a couple of weeks ago when it was a thought
[01:29:42.720 --> 01:29:46.560]  that okay max we're going to break your mics distorting just a tad you may want to back
[01:29:46.560 --> 01:29:50.200]  off at a bit we're gonna have a special report on guns and the attack on them in the back

[01:33:16.080 --> 01:33:26.360]  a through the lies and disinformation bob costes has responded to my call that he be fired
[01:33:26.360 --> 01:33:33.320]  if he does not apologize and obviously others have been calling for that as well he put out
[01:33:33.320 --> 01:33:37.160]  one clarification last night that basically said we were too stupid to understand what
[01:33:37.160 --> 01:33:41.280]  he was saying so another slap in the face of a video about that up on info wars dot
[01:33:41.280 --> 01:33:46.400]  com we're about to premiere a detailed analysis of this and then go back to max keiser of
[01:33:46.400 --> 01:33:53.200]  max keiser dot com he then went on in a new u.s.a. today that has a transcript of here
[01:33:53.200 --> 01:34:01.320]  on the dan patrick show today this morning saying that sometimes the quality of those
[01:34:01.320 --> 01:34:07.280]  who oppose you speaks for itself and then he wanted to talk about racist so so now everything's
[01:34:07.280 --> 01:34:12.120]  racist if you don't you just say racist like oh you want on guns are racist so just said
[01:34:12.120 --> 01:34:16.440]  well there's some racism and then he goes on to say a discussion should ensue about
[01:34:16.440 --> 01:34:21.560]  the football culture which is totally degenerate nowadays and he added the gun culture so they're
[01:34:21.560 --> 01:34:26.680]  trying to blame guns for you for the gangster culture domestic violence so so now guns are
[01:34:26.680 --> 01:34:31.160]  domestic violence those issues should be discussed if we're looking for some kind of elusive
[01:34:31.160 --> 01:34:37.160]  perspective some some more arrogant statements here so not a real apology but he's gone from
[01:34:37.160 --> 01:34:43.640]  saying oh let me correct misinterpretations to oh let me correct mistakes to but still
[01:34:43.640 --> 01:34:47.920]  you shouldn't be able to own guns so you need to be fired cost is okay and everybody knows
[01:34:47.920 --> 01:34:51.880]  who you are going to be a boycott of the nfl because they authorized what you did same
[01:34:51.880 --> 01:34:56.920]  thing NBC and foxes is all started with their columnist on fox sports saying the second
[01:34:56.920 --> 01:35:01.080]  amendment needs to be banned and anybody that owns guns or racist and whites are basically
[01:35:01.080 --> 01:35:04.640]  inherently bad people and I guess that's that's what you see out of rupert murdoch right
[01:35:04.640 --> 01:35:09.480]  there just unbelievable how disgusting this is we're gonna air a report I did with Aaron
[01:35:09.480 --> 01:35:14.080]  dykes on this premiering here and we're gonna go right back to max keiser with where he
[01:35:14.080 --> 01:35:19.760]  how he sees the collapse unfolding because unfortunately it looks like he may be right
[01:35:19.760 --> 01:35:23.480]  and it's an engineered collapse in ways we can protect ourselves with max keiser but
[01:35:23.480 --> 01:35:28.520]  first here's this report people have credibility with young people should be on the television
[01:35:28.520 --> 01:35:33.040]  telling these youngsters that it's long the carry on ultimate tragedy bloodied and dead
[01:35:33.040 --> 01:35:38.160]  javon belcher's action handguns do not enhance our safety and just really brainwash people
[01:35:38.160 --> 01:35:44.400]  into thinking about guns in a vastly different way the assault weapons ban made sense well
[01:35:44.400 --> 01:35:48.360]  the establishment's war against the right to keep their arms and the rest of our bill
[01:35:48.360 --> 01:35:54.080]  of rights is now reaching a high tide mark and you can make no mistake bob costes during
[01:35:54.080 --> 01:36:00.280]  sunday night football on NBC was declaring war on the second amendment you want some
[01:36:00.280 --> 01:36:05.520]  actual perspective on this well a bit of it comes from the Kansas City base writer jason
[01:36:05.520 --> 01:36:11.680]  witlock our current gun culture witlock wrote ensures that more and more domestic disputes
[01:36:11.680 --> 01:36:16.240]  will end in the ultimate tragedy and that more convenience store confrontations over
[01:36:16.240 --> 01:36:21.600]  loud music coming from a car will leave more teenage boys bloodied and dead and make no
[01:36:21.600 --> 01:36:27.280]  mistake he was reading off a teleprompter at that time and his remarks had all been
[01:36:27.280 --> 01:36:33.960]  pre approved handguns do not enhance our safety they exacerbate our flaws tempt us to escalate
[01:36:33.960 --> 01:36:40.560]  arguments and bait us into embracing confrontation rather than avoiding it turning the nfl into
[01:36:40.560 --> 01:36:47.840]  even more of a propaganda tool of the authoritarians that control washington dc if javon belcher
[01:36:47.840 --> 01:36:55.440]  didn't possess a gun he and kassandra perkins would both be alive today leave it to NBC and
[01:36:55.440 --> 01:37:01.400]  bob costes to take a tragic event and try to capitalize on it to destroy the second
[01:37:01.400 --> 01:37:10.400]  amendment of our bill of rights and constitution coming out and blaming a tragic shooting on
[01:37:10.400 --> 01:37:17.320]  the second amendment is asinine it's like blaming obesity on spoons and forks but that's
[01:37:17.320 --> 01:37:23.440]  exactly what he did costus really thinks we're stupid when he says you know there's a gun
[01:37:23.440 --> 01:37:30.240]  culture in the nfl you mean the thug culture that's in the nfl pit bull fights and all
[01:37:30.240 --> 01:37:38.320]  the rest of it you mean that culture they're trying to claim that the american gun culture
[01:37:38.320 --> 01:37:45.080]  is the thug culture that's in the nfl don't blame us for your culture of drugged out of
[01:37:45.080 --> 01:37:52.320]  their mind athletes on pain pills and psychotropic drugs like prozac known to cause psychotic
[01:37:52.320 --> 01:37:58.120]  breaks and men who have had concussions after concussions after concussions going home and
[01:37:58.120 --> 01:38:04.920]  killing their families and you notice ob costes says i know in the days to come the nfl may
[01:38:04.920 --> 01:38:10.240]  get blamed but you can't deny it's guns if there wouldn't have been guns this wouldn't
[01:38:10.240 --> 01:38:14.560]  have happened he's saying let's blame the second amendment let's blame one of the few
[01:38:14.560 --> 01:38:21.080]  rights left in this country let's not blame the nfl and the decanate gladiatorial spectacle
[01:38:21.080 --> 01:38:28.200]  it's become the bureaucracy that's hijacked this country admits they're coming after our
[01:38:28.200 --> 01:38:38.200]  firearms they have told us that they are doing this part of it is seeing if we can get an
[01:38:38.200 --> 01:38:42.760]  assault weapons ban reintroduced an assault weapons ban reintroduced obama four years
[01:38:42.760 --> 01:38:48.760]  ago told supporters that he doesn't like bitter clingers people that cling to their second
[01:38:48.760 --> 01:39:00.000]  amendment think of how stupid the gun grabbers think you are they point out the violence
[01:39:00.000 --> 01:39:04.120]  that's going on in the youth of this country in places like chicago and new york that have
[01:39:04.120 --> 01:39:09.400]  the highest crime rates in the united states where they've completely banned guns for the
[01:39:09.400 --> 01:39:14.120]  general public and they point at chicago and new york and say that's the reason that we
[01:39:14.120 --> 01:39:18.760]  need to turn our guns in in places like texas frankly in my hometown of chicago there's an
[01:39:18.760 --> 01:39:23.240]  awful lot of violence and they're not using ak-47s they're using cheap handguns it's incredible
[01:39:23.240 --> 01:39:28.520]  they take the guns the crime rates explode in those areas all the crime rates drop in
[01:39:28.520 --> 01:39:36.320]  areas all over the united states where you have a high rate of legal lawful gun ownership
[01:39:36.320 --> 01:39:41.920]  i expected the victim disarmament anti-defense crowd to come out and use this tragedy but
[01:39:41.920 --> 01:39:48.200]  to see the nfl nbc via their frontman bob costas do it lets you know that they are blowing
[01:39:48.200 --> 01:39:53.880]  the bugle that they are charging in on our second amendment and all the facts prove that
[01:39:53.880 --> 01:40:00.440]  that is what is now happening none of us very under any illusion that reinstating that ban
[01:40:00.440 --> 01:40:07.160]  would be easy and so what we focused on is existing laws if the president would stage
[01:40:07.160 --> 01:40:11.880]  fast and furious shipping guns into mexico to demonize the second amendment and call
[01:40:11.880 --> 01:40:17.760]  for a gun ban they will use any crisis out there to restrict our guns trafficking illegal
[01:40:17.760 --> 01:40:24.040]  firearms sending them across the border is illegal that's something that we can stop
[01:40:24.040 --> 01:40:31.880]  and so our focus is to work with uh... secretary napolitano keep in mind he did it
[01:40:31.880 --> 01:40:37.680]  and now the reports are going to come out that obama may use executive orders to restrict
[01:40:37.680 --> 01:40:41.280]  the second amendment because he can't get congress to do it he's already done that on
[01:40:41.280 --> 01:40:45.000]  cyber security he's already done that shutting down power plants he's already said nato in
[01:40:45.000 --> 01:40:49.600]  the u n command our military he is becoming a dictator more and more they have asked the
[01:40:49.600 --> 01:40:55.080]  media to go out and blame everything on our right to keep their arms people have credibility
[01:40:55.080 --> 01:40:58.760]  with young people should be on the television telling these youngsters that it's wrong to
[01:40:58.760 --> 01:41:04.520]  carry a gun so what you're seeing is part of the brainwashing that attorney general
[01:41:04.520 --> 01:41:10.200]  holder called for more than 15 years ago and is calling for again and just really brainwash
[01:41:10.200 --> 01:41:15.200]  people into thinking about guns in a vastly different way and the fact that cost us would
[01:41:15.200 --> 01:41:21.680]  be authorized to do something like this during sunday football with the nfl let you know
[01:41:21.680 --> 01:41:27.120]  they mean business a corporate company man like cost us you know he got it approved so
[01:41:27.120 --> 01:41:35.440]  this is the nfl and nbc endorsing an attack on one of the few basic liberties that america
[01:41:35.440 --> 01:41:44.160]  has left unbelievably outrageous and signals a coordinated attack on the second amendment
[01:41:44.160 --> 01:41:49.520]  and if we won't speak out against this now if we won't demand that bob cost us at least
[01:41:49.520 --> 01:41:56.320]  apologize for using this tragedy we're going to lose our second amendment now hank williams
[01:41:56.320 --> 01:42:01.960]  jr. said this country was turning into a dictatorship and he was fired you mean when john bainer played
[01:42:01.960 --> 01:42:09.760]  golf with president obama oh yeah it'd be like hitler playing golf with net okay okay
[01:42:09.760 --> 01:42:17.680]  not hardly all we're asking for is that bob cost us apologize and that the nfl repudiate
[01:42:17.680 --> 01:42:24.960]  what was said as well as nbc but if that is not done i promise you this and over 150 million
[01:42:24.960 --> 01:42:32.720]  other gun owners in this country do as well we are not going to rest until the nfl loses
[01:42:32.720 --> 01:42:38.960]  a large portion of their audience and nbc sponsors or boycott it it's time to turn off
[01:42:38.960 --> 01:42:45.520]  the nfl it's time to turn off nbc and it's time to stop watching that little globalist
[01:42:45.520 --> 01:42:52.160]  frontman bob cost us it's time to take it personal when they try to take our guns that's
[01:42:52.160 --> 01:43:01.040]  why i'm calling for everyone to mail spoons with a note explaining to nbc that blaming guns for
[01:43:01.040 --> 01:43:07.360]  crime is like blaming spoons for fat people and it's time to mail bob cost us spoons we're going to
[01:43:07.360 --> 01:43:14.320]  put the address under this video in the links below and it's time to call the sponsors of nbc
[01:43:14.320 --> 01:43:19.520]  and the nfl and to let them know you're not going to support them either it's time for the american
[01:43:19.520 --> 01:43:25.680]  people to stand up it's time for the sleeping giant that is the united states of america to
[01:43:25.680 --> 01:43:31.040]  rediscover the bill of rights and constitution these are our rights and you are not going to
[01:43:31.040 --> 01:43:38.080]  steal them do you understand this the second amendment is the line in the sand i'm alex jones
[01:43:38.080 --> 01:43:45.680]  signing off for info wars dot com all right that video will be live the next 10 minutes at info
[01:43:45.680 --> 01:43:50.480]  wars dot com and prison punna dot com and i will tweet it out at the real alex jones please retweet
[01:43:50.480 --> 01:43:55.520]  it and again also follow max keiser max keiser dot com again i apologize to max for airing that
[01:43:55.520 --> 01:43:59.120]  but erin stayed up all night to get it done and then we wanted it for the first hour but we were
[01:43:59.120 --> 01:44:03.120]  behind and so we aired it now we're always honored to have max keiser but but it's good to have that
[01:44:03.120 --> 01:44:07.920]  in the middle of the report as well you've got the floor till we go to break max any comments on the
[01:44:07.920 --> 01:44:13.040]  gun thing but getting back into your bold prediction that the collapse is really going to accelerate
[01:44:13.040 --> 01:44:17.200]  in april you've already broken down why that's happening we've got the head of the bank of england
[01:44:18.000 --> 01:44:22.080]  saying what you're saying now you're in england right now that's pretty creepy
[01:44:22.080 --> 01:44:29.280]  so tell us what it'll look like and where it goes from there hey well first of all oj simpson
[01:44:29.280 --> 01:44:35.840]  didn't have a gun didn't stop him from killing uh his wife wow that's incredible i actually made
[01:44:35.840 --> 01:44:40.400]  that point in the video but erin cut it out for some reason yeah uh nicole simpson she did
[01:44:40.400 --> 01:44:46.160]  a nice with a with a concealed carry uh when oj or whoever it was brought that knife to a gunfight
[01:44:47.840 --> 01:44:53.600]  yeah well wasn't bob costes involved in a pedophile scandal with sandusky for a while he
[01:44:53.600 --> 01:44:57.920]  had him on his show and they were trying to cover that up for a while until sandusky got on the show
[01:44:57.920 --> 01:45:02.720]  and basically admitted he was a pedophile then bob had what you see that image of him all shaken up
[01:45:02.720 --> 01:45:07.840]  like oh my god i invited a pedophile on my show and then he tried to you know talk his way out of
[01:45:07.840 --> 01:45:14.160]  it so this guy's a loser but anyway talking about the collapse of the uh you know essential bank
[01:45:14.160 --> 01:45:19.840]  system and fiat currencies around the world this is uh as i say baked into the cake now
[01:45:20.480 --> 01:45:26.800]  i believe we're going to see it by april of 2013 if i'm wrong i will i will happily admit
[01:45:26.800 --> 01:45:31.200]  that i was wrong on my timing um you know the trends are still there and they're still in
[01:45:31.200 --> 01:45:35.440]  place somebody else will get the timing perhaps better than i than i have i'm going to stick to
[01:45:35.440 --> 01:45:41.040]  my timing but uh you know in the united states it's remarkable that two weeks ago three weeks ago
[01:45:41.040 --> 01:45:45.760]  to give you an idea of the disconnect people have with with what's happening in the central
[01:45:45.760 --> 01:45:51.040]  banks on wall street remember when there was a threat they were going to close down the producer
[01:45:51.040 --> 01:45:57.200]  of twinkies and then within an hour twinkies were selling for eight thousand dollars at twinkie on
[01:45:57.200 --> 01:46:02.720]  ebay now that gives you an idea of the disconnect in the united states that the average person has
[01:46:02.720 --> 01:46:09.360]  with with what the values are that run the system versus what the intrinsic value of a twinkie
[01:46:09.920 --> 01:46:16.240]  actually is so you know you had this remarkable explosion of twinkie buying on ebay because
[01:46:16.240 --> 01:46:21.360]  people were scared that suddenly twinkies were not being available anymore and then that mania
[01:46:21.360 --> 01:46:26.960]  passed six six hours or ten hours later and was on to some other mania you know people of course
[01:46:26.960 --> 01:46:32.800]  would probably get totally caught up in an nfl game over the weekend where they can watch steroid
[01:46:32.800 --> 01:46:38.160]  driven drug addicts pound each other over the head for a million dollars a quarter it's true
[01:46:39.760 --> 01:46:43.920]  you know so they're just going from from distraction to distraction but meanwhile
[01:46:43.920 --> 01:46:49.920]  the main theme here that i need i'm going to emphasize is the central banks themselves that
[01:46:49.920 --> 01:46:59.120]  for 30 40 years were colluding in pushing a financialization a transactionalization a world
[01:46:59.120 --> 01:47:07.440]  that where work and labor was replaced with technocracy and money they no longer trust each
[01:47:07.440 --> 01:47:13.200]  other that is a fundamental difference today started in 2009 after the big collapse of 2008
[01:47:13.200 --> 01:47:19.120]  and that and we know that they don't trust each other because they themselves are the biggest
[01:47:19.120 --> 01:47:26.080]  buyers of gold now here's the big moment that's going to change everything is when central banks
[01:47:26.080 --> 01:47:32.560]  who are now issuing money or creating money through quantitative easing to buy government bonds
[01:47:33.440 --> 01:47:37.840]  one of those central banks is going to break ranks and they're going to start printing money
[01:47:37.840 --> 01:47:45.040]  to buy gold and that will be the moment when gold starts to go on a magnificent tear on the
[01:47:45.040 --> 01:47:50.640]  upside and the global sovereign bond market starts to collapse because one of these banks
[01:47:50.640 --> 01:47:56.800]  is going to say enough is enough the obvious contenders are china and russia those are the
[01:47:56.800 --> 01:48:02.560]  obvious contenders the obvious contenders for a currency collapse hyperinflation we see in
[01:48:02.560 --> 01:48:10.720]  japan and in the uk the uk is one of the has 900 debt to gdp it's one of the worst in the world so
[01:48:10.720 --> 01:48:15.120]  that's why we're here because we're covering the collapse in london and since we've been here as
[01:48:15.120 --> 01:48:20.400]  you pointed out the rhetoric coming out of the bank of england is that this the bank of is that
[01:48:20.400 --> 01:48:26.640]  quantitative easing doesn't work anymore the debts are unsustainable and the economy is collapsing
[01:48:26.640 --> 01:48:32.480]  and there's very little that anyone can do so that's pretty much the the scenario up to this point
[01:48:34.400 --> 01:48:38.960]  how is raising all these massive taxes in europe the united states going to fix things so they're
[01:48:38.960 --> 01:48:43.200]  not idiots they know when they raise taxes on the poor middle class it's going to make these
[01:48:43.200 --> 01:48:49.040]  countries like greece ireland spain the united states go into cardiac arrest but that's what
[01:48:49.040 --> 01:48:55.200]  they're doing the republicans and democrats are debating how much taxes to raise instead of
[01:48:55.200 --> 01:49:02.320]  uh talking about uh you know trying to rebuild the country uh what's your take on that well raising
[01:49:02.320 --> 01:49:08.960]  taxes will not increase the tax take at the end of the year because it'll put more people and
[01:49:08.960 --> 01:49:14.240]  companies out of business uh than it than any incremental gain on a marginal tax increase
[01:49:14.240 --> 01:49:19.040]  so net net the tax take is going to be uh is going to be worse the reason i point to april of
[01:49:19.040 --> 01:49:26.560]  2013 is my target date for the collapse is because i think the tax revenues reported for 2013 in the
[01:49:26.560 --> 01:49:33.200]  united states will be shockingly underestimates and this will force the major rating agencies moody's
[01:49:33.200 --> 01:49:38.560]  s and p and fits to downgrade the u.s government bond they've already downgraded to work uh we
[01:49:38.560 --> 01:49:42.560]  thought we think we're going to downgrade that again but the establishment knows that so they
[01:49:42.560 --> 01:49:47.200]  want to destroy the country but the establishment is buying gold that's what i'm saying they're
[01:49:47.200 --> 01:49:52.800]  buying gold and silver and because they don't trust each other and they know that uh in extremists
[01:49:52.800 --> 01:49:57.920]  even alan greenspan famously said that uh we learned from the collapse of germany in the
[01:49:57.920 --> 01:50:06.480]  40s that in extremists only gold is is is counted as money and alan greenspan of course is is the
[01:50:06.480 --> 01:50:12.800]  maestro of the of of the essential bank that is the creator of the bubbles that that of course
[01:50:12.800 --> 01:50:19.360]  are the monster that ate the global economy so for him to even point this out is quite significant
[01:50:19.360 --> 01:50:26.800]  and this is unknown amongst those who understand the history of banking and money that when you
[01:50:26.800 --> 01:50:32.560]  have this type of crisis gold is really the only uh extinguisher of that is one way sure and they
[01:50:32.560 --> 01:50:37.680]  continue to kind of put things off but there's still that slow slide i mean the economy worldwide
[01:50:37.680 --> 01:50:43.200]  is getting worse and worse i want to come back and ask you max well slow slide it's deceptive
[01:50:43.200 --> 01:50:50.080]  because if you look at a chart like enron remember enron the stock went from two dollars to ninety
[01:50:50.080 --> 01:50:54.560]  dollar so stay there explain it to us on the other side and then i want to ask you will these
[01:50:54.560 --> 01:50:59.280]  globalists get away with it or is there any way to arrest them and then how would you fix the
[01:50:59.280 --> 01:51:05.840]  economy we'll be right back with max geiser strategic relocation is a systematic way to think

[01:54:50.640 --> 01:54:55.280]  you've got the floor with the point you were making about uh any way to arrest these bankers
[01:54:55.280 --> 01:54:59.840]  any way to bring them to justice but you're making another point as well yeah no they you know the
[01:54:59.840 --> 01:55:05.520]  the guests on your show you've had and we've talked about this collapse coming and and you know the
[01:55:05.520 --> 01:55:12.720]  question is when and um i think that it's you know if you're standing on on the surface of the earth
[01:55:12.720 --> 01:55:18.080]  you know it's tough to see that you're actually standing on a around object because it's a very
[01:55:18.080 --> 01:55:24.560]  large object and this crisis is very large but when it happens it'll happen quite quickly because
[01:55:24.560 --> 01:55:28.880]  this is an historic bubble we're talking about for bonds for you know you have to go back and
[01:55:28.880 --> 01:55:36.880]  compare to let's say the tulip bulb mania in holland in 1634 the price of tulip bulbs went from
[01:55:36.880 --> 01:55:44.160]  one and a half to 60 to zero uh in in france during the mississippi bubble the the stock in that
[01:55:44.800 --> 01:55:52.880]  policy scheme went from 500 to 18 000 to zero the south sea bubble of 17 20 the stock went from
[01:55:52.880 --> 01:56:02.240]  100 to 1200 now more recently with enron the stock went from $2 to 90 to zero what i'm saying is that
[01:56:02.240 --> 01:56:10.080]  the government bonds in america the u.s treasury bond has never been hired in 240 years and the
[01:56:10.080 --> 01:56:18.800]  treasury bond in the uk has never been higher in 300 years and when the bubble pops it'll collapse
[01:56:18.800 --> 01:56:26.080]  by 50 60 70 percent in with lightning speed as we've seen with these other historic bubbles
[01:56:26.080 --> 01:56:31.600]  so it'll be too late to do anything at that time you have to be prepared beforehand and
[01:56:31.600 --> 01:56:37.760]  if you want proof of what i'm saying is true look at what these central banks are doing
[01:56:37.760 --> 01:56:44.400]  for since 1971 they were net sellers of gold and they bought paper but from 2009 after the collapse
[01:56:44.400 --> 01:56:51.280]  of 2009 the believing brothers they became net buyers of gold gold they're buying over 500 tons
[01:56:51.280 --> 01:56:57.280]  this year and because they don't trust each other because they know this bubble is about to pop i i
[01:56:57.280 --> 01:57:03.360]  always go with the money i go with the smart money china has the money and they're smart enough to be
[01:57:03.360 --> 01:57:08.400]  buying gold the central bankers have the money and pretty soon they're going to be issuing money
[01:57:08.400 --> 01:57:13.840]  to buy gold instead of the bonds that are in this huge bubble and so those are the factors that we
[01:57:13.840 --> 01:57:20.800]  see in front of our face and we know that when this bubble pops this historic bubble like nasdaq
[01:57:20.800 --> 01:57:28.160]  from 1981 to 2000 and it went from 100 to 5000 then crashed to 1500 uh in nikkei remember the nikkei
[01:57:28.160 --> 01:57:36.080]  bubble from 1970 to 1992 it went from 3000 to 40 000 then crashed to 8 000 at one point you had in
[01:57:36.080 --> 01:57:42.000]  in in jeff in japan that the land under the royal palace was worth more than the entire state of
[01:57:42.000 --> 01:57:47.600]  california and once and once that happened more than 15 years ago they've never come back no uh in
[01:57:47.600 --> 01:57:52.480]  japan so you're saying there's going to be a treasury bubble go under we're in a bubble treasury
[01:57:52.480 --> 01:57:59.600]  bubble it's never oh my god do you attend your u.s treasury bond has not been this high that is a
[01:57:59.600 --> 01:58:03.680]  say no you're saying it's coming to an end it's obviously the biggest bubble in 300 years you're
[01:58:03.680 --> 01:58:12.640]  saying it begins to pop or will pop coming up uh on uh april 15th or thereafter how bad will it be it'll

[02:01:01.120 --> 02:01:07.680]  the second amendment hey bob costas doubled and tripled down he says people men should not be able
[02:01:07.680 --> 02:01:15.040]  to own guns at ages 20 to 30 we cannot be trusted what do you make of that christina
[02:01:16.960 --> 02:01:24.240]  um i only own one done right now but plan on getting a few my boyfriend has several so
[02:01:24.240 --> 02:01:28.960]  we're kind of keeping an eye on them well i hope he's not 20 to 30 years old bob costas says
[02:01:29.520 --> 02:01:36.880]  those are bad people men are bad i'm actually 30 he's he's eight years older than me oh well good
[02:01:36.880 --> 02:01:42.720]  you can't have a you can't have 30 year olds with guns good good bob costas said so a little
[02:01:42.720 --> 02:01:49.840]  runt sorry go ahead now i had heard something uh several months ago and i've been trying to find
[02:01:49.840 --> 02:01:57.200]  information on it and i can't really um something about after they take the guns the un go through
[02:01:57.200 --> 02:02:02.080]  and starts taking the guns that they might send troops in through the texas border to get into
[02:02:02.080 --> 02:02:07.200]  the well look look it won't be a sneak attack they've got police exchange programs where they send
[02:02:07.200 --> 02:02:12.880]  our police over to europe and then come over here to japan vice versa to where you'll be arrested
[02:02:12.880 --> 02:02:17.360]  under international law and taken to the haig for your free speech and drug off and they're just
[02:02:17.360 --> 02:02:22.560]  acclimating our troops when you now hear about nato deaths in afghanistan so it'll just be that
[02:02:22.560 --> 02:02:28.560]  foreign troops are phased into our military in le09 they started publicly admitting troops from 15
[02:02:28.560 --> 02:02:34.800]  nations here training to quote backup american forces under north com if terrorist attack and
[02:02:34.800 --> 02:02:40.080]  it listed them as domestic extremists and they drilled not to fight muslim extremists that's for
[02:02:40.080 --> 02:02:46.080]  the public consumption they drill to fight veterans i can show you the new york times on that
[02:02:46.720 --> 02:02:52.560]  they drill to kill veterans so that's how it'll work it won't be you and troops show up like red
[02:02:52.560 --> 02:02:57.760]  dawn it's that you know these are we got footage in chicago of foreign troops training with our
[02:02:57.760 --> 02:03:04.800]  military to put citizens in the uh sportsdom not a couple years back when she was living in
[02:03:04.800 --> 02:03:11.440]  livingston in texas um she told me about y'all's show and at the time unfortunately i was working
[02:03:11.440 --> 02:03:18.800]  for a private ice facility uh in livingston right next to the plunsky unit i worked for tdc for a
[02:03:18.800 --> 02:03:27.360]  while as well and it took me several years after i got severely hurt on that unit i almost died
[02:03:27.360 --> 02:03:34.560]  from an inmate assault oddly enough we were short-handed that night and uh i also refused to forge
[02:03:34.560 --> 02:03:40.080]  paperwork i wouldn't i wouldn't forge any paperwork i wouldn't forge any documents and say i did it
[02:03:41.360 --> 02:03:45.680]  so and i had called them and let them know something was wrong and nobody came down
[02:03:45.680 --> 02:03:50.560]  and i ended up with a broken jaw in two places and almost had my broke foot open well that's what
[02:03:50.560 --> 02:03:55.360]  they do they probably told them and statistically they probably sent the inmate to kill you yeah
[02:03:55.360 --> 02:04:01.920]  that's now that i'm out of the system and i'm the programming is taking and run its course
[02:04:01.920 --> 02:04:07.200]  with the help of family uh it took me a while and then i know i mean you know the big private
[02:04:07.200 --> 02:04:12.080]  prisons that's the model they put the gangs in charge and then and then let them sell the drugs
[02:04:12.080 --> 02:04:15.840]  everybody and it's totally corrupt and then the jail guards don't have to really do anything
[02:04:15.840 --> 02:04:19.760]  i mean that's the model and and then that's a new enforcement army those are colleges
[02:04:19.760 --> 02:04:25.760]  to roll those gangs out against the american people and then they work for the uh the feds that's on
[02:04:25.760 --> 02:04:31.520]  record uh max keiser's written about it but i mean it's on record uh and i don't know about
[02:04:31.520 --> 02:04:36.480]  those ice units uh but uh that's pretty much part of the course i mean that's like serpico
[02:04:36.480 --> 02:04:41.920]  he wouldn't take drug money and stuff all the other detectives were on drugs you know drug money
[02:04:41.920 --> 02:04:45.520]  and other things because once you do that one do other stuff and you know they shot him in the face
[02:04:45.520 --> 02:04:52.400]  so that's what they do uh a lot of departments aren't that corrupt but big city ones generally
[02:04:52.400 --> 02:04:58.480]  are um i've got to say i don't have evidence the austin police department is a mafia which
[02:04:58.480 --> 02:05:06.560]  is very rare in big cities this man wants your guns that is the cover of the 60 page glossy

[02:11:42.240 --> 02:11:48.800]  hitting every hour every day with it and they're making a lot more out of it than it is because
[02:11:48.800 --> 02:11:54.480]  it's not just a fiscal cliff it's a much bigger story than that but they're not telling the whole
[02:11:54.480 --> 02:12:01.600]  story and the story is this they've you know they synthesized it down that well you know
[02:12:01.600 --> 02:12:07.760]  we'll go over the fiscal cliff if we don't cut the budget deficit uh the federal budget deficit
[02:12:07.760 --> 02:12:14.320]  because it's out of line and the way we're going to do it is we have two ideas because we're only
[02:12:14.320 --> 02:12:20.560]  the republicans the democrats we could only come up with two ideas because we're too damn stupid
[02:12:20.560 --> 02:12:26.720]  to think of anything more we'll call ourselves the incompetence and the inept's i got an idea
[02:12:26.720 --> 02:12:35.280]  here let's let's cut spending okay great i got another idea let's let's talk about taxes we'll
[02:12:35.280 --> 02:12:41.280]  either increase them or we'll decrease them that's the end of the story that's how far these morons
[02:12:41.280 --> 02:12:47.040]  go why don't we talk about the whole issue here if you're going to cut spending and you're going
[02:12:47.040 --> 02:12:54.400]  to increase taxes guess what you're going to do moron you're going to slow down the economy
[02:12:54.400 --> 02:13:00.080]  hey the economy's not slowing down enough for you let's really put the brakes on it
[02:13:00.080 --> 02:13:09.840]  then what does it do well 70 percent of the gdp in the united states is consumer spending 70
[02:13:09.840 --> 02:13:17.520]  percent yeah that's right because they sold out the country they offshored our manufacturing
[02:13:17.520 --> 02:13:25.120]  you remember it bill clinton that wonderful liberal yeah the debate with ross burrow and algore
[02:13:25.120 --> 02:13:31.600]  yeah oh we're gonna have great jobs we don't need those manufacturing jobs we can have service sector
[02:13:31.600 --> 02:13:39.280]  jobs oh service sector service servitude right you get to be a cashier you could you could
[02:13:39.280 --> 02:13:44.640]  stock shelves at walmart oh you could be on a call center the ones that we still have here
[02:13:44.640 --> 02:13:50.320]  that they haven't shipped to india the philippines so now you're gonna cut spending you're gonna
[02:13:50.320 --> 02:13:58.560]  increase taxes you're gonna slow down the economy less people work less tax revenues come in brilliant
[02:13:58.560 --> 02:14:07.200]  so how are we going to solve this problem it's very simple and no one will talk about it why won't
[02:14:07.200 --> 02:14:13.200]  they talk about it because of the gambinos and the bananas the two crime families that made these
[02:14:13.200 --> 02:14:20.560]  problems happen so how could any imbecile any thinking person look upon the people that caused
[02:14:20.560 --> 02:14:29.200]  the problem to solve it they can't the way you solve it is number one bring the jobs back home
[02:14:30.000 --> 02:14:37.760]  put back in place what bill clinton took away from us what george w bus accelerated
[02:14:37.760 --> 02:14:45.040]  and what obama keeps going by bragging that we're making up more trade deals there oh yeah you
[02:14:45.040 --> 02:14:51.200]  know what a trade deal is very simple hey how about that lovely fire over there in bangladesh
[02:14:51.200 --> 02:14:58.480]  that killed over a hundred people in the sweatshop a trade deal means you take all of your manufacturing
[02:14:58.480 --> 02:15:04.800]  anything that service anything that you could do bring it to a slave labor country and then bring
[02:15:04.800 --> 02:15:09.680]  it back and mark the price that actually brings down those countries almost all the studies show
[02:15:09.680 --> 02:15:14.320]  then you destroy mexico they kick them off their agurian land then they all come up here drive down
[02:15:14.320 --> 02:15:20.400]  the wages even more and the globalist brag it's a consolidation a race to the bottom they know
[02:15:20.400 --> 02:15:26.720]  what they're doing but al gore got up uh you know in 94 in those debates with ross perot and larry
[02:15:26.720 --> 02:15:32.080]  king and they all laughed at ross perot when he said it was a giant sucking sound but guess what it
[02:15:32.080 --> 02:15:38.400]  was and then they have tax incentives to move the jobs overseas and they spend 21 22 billion dollars
[02:15:38.400 --> 02:15:43.360]  to move catalac and vault factories to china and brazil and that's a good deal gerald they're
[02:15:43.360 --> 02:15:49.760]  going to bail out general motors by moving it overseas i mean they are gutting this country
[02:15:49.760 --> 02:15:55.920]  exactly so the fiscal cliff is a lot of crap that's what i'm trying to say and you nailed it you put
[02:15:55.920 --> 02:16:03.600]  all the details into it so the first one is that the second one is put back the regulations that
[02:16:03.600 --> 02:16:11.600]  gave this the people in this country and even shot at the deal and those regulations you know
[02:16:11.600 --> 02:16:17.920]  from the 19th to the 20th century the robber barons were taken over the country now they just
[02:16:17.920 --> 02:16:24.400]  got different names they got names like private equity groups hedge funds yeah black rock golden
[02:16:24.400 --> 02:16:32.640]  sacks gang all of these companies that have taken over all the the whole the whole country
[02:16:32.640 --> 02:16:38.480]  whether it's in retail whether it's in aggregate culture whether it's in community and they take
[02:16:38.480 --> 02:16:43.680]  the money they suck and move it to a third world hell pit to sell us junk back to dig the whole
[02:16:43.680 --> 02:16:52.400]  deeper they're waging economic war against us they're enslaving us it's a plantation economy
[02:16:52.400 --> 02:17:00.720]  that's all it is you're looking i'm not making this up you know what median household income
[02:17:00.720 --> 02:17:07.680]  has fallen over 10 percent since the great recession began in 2008 i'm not making it up
[02:17:07.680 --> 02:17:14.960]  that 50 percent of the kids that get caught with college degrees that get jobs are making jobs
[02:17:14.960 --> 02:17:20.080]  that that are paying wages that you could get with a high school diploma and that you can't
[02:17:20.080 --> 02:17:26.960]  live on i'm not making it up so when you look at what they've done hey you know when i was a kid
[02:17:26.960 --> 02:17:33.680]  that's a strange thing just have pharmacies on the corner that were owned by people in the community
[02:17:33.680 --> 02:17:40.800]  there were no right aides of war greens there were no there were no duane reeds or cvs's
[02:17:40.800 --> 02:17:49.920]  clogging up every corner everybody had a shot at it until the until the politicians got paid
[02:17:49.920 --> 02:17:57.840]  off to deregulate they deregulated the robinson patman act they deregulated the sherman antitrust
[02:17:57.840 --> 02:18:06.080]  act they re deregulated the clayton antitrust act and what did they do oh under bill clinton again
[02:18:06.080 --> 02:18:12.320]  yeah you know the one that everybody loves oh just a little side note i heard obama during
[02:18:12.320 --> 02:18:19.200]  the campaign he kept saying you know on the bill clinton we created 23 million jobs his government did
[02:18:20.000 --> 02:18:27.280]  bs the reason we had 23 million jobs back then for anybody that's old enough to remember
[02:18:27.280 --> 02:18:33.840]  you mentioned 1994 that was the beginning of the internet revolution the dot-com bubble
[02:18:33.840 --> 02:18:41.040]  it was a whole new world was being born but i digress bill clinton is the guy
[02:18:41.040 --> 02:18:48.800]  that under the other member of the goldman sacks gang ravi rubin began the process of
[02:18:48.800 --> 02:18:55.360]  deregulating the economy on the financial end by killing the glass steagle act that was put in
[02:18:55.360 --> 02:19:03.360]  place during the great depression so that the banks couldn't rob all our money by making up
[02:19:03.360 --> 02:19:09.280]  all of these games to steal it from us from everywhere we could look at so those are two ways
[02:19:09.280 --> 02:19:16.640]  to solve the fiscal problem the third very simple and this is one of the big trends
[02:19:16.640 --> 02:19:23.680]  it's going to be the major one the major trend of 2013 they're taking us to war
[02:19:25.040 --> 02:19:32.880]  the eisenhower said it i keep saying it over again five star general supreme commander the
[02:19:32.880 --> 02:19:41.200]  allied forces during world war two he warned us oh two germ republican president i forgot
[02:19:41.760 --> 02:19:47.600]  he warned us that the mill oh and no major wars were fought when he was president you know why
[02:19:47.600 --> 02:19:54.160]  because he was a man he was a man that saw death and destruction he was a man that fought not like
[02:19:54.160 --> 02:19:59.520]  these little boys with cahola let's come back the carrier and the invasion forces getting ready

[02:24:58.800 --> 02:25:06.880]  gerald it is now in articles in mclatchy news la times you name it drudge report matt drudge
[02:25:06.880 --> 02:25:13.680]  tweeted out oh look now you're going to go you know and have wmd hysteria and lies before the
[02:25:13.680 --> 02:25:18.000]  un saying syria is going to use their chemical weapons which they admit they have they haven't
[02:25:18.000 --> 02:25:25.120]  attacked anybody the west for 21 months is using al qaeda against them and now the news admits what
[02:25:25.120 --> 02:25:29.840]  we've known for a while there our government is putting al qaeda in with nato the french are
[02:25:29.840 --> 02:25:35.040]  massing ships the british are that there's a u.s aircraft carrier and three amphibious landing
[02:25:35.600 --> 02:25:41.120]  ships which they don't i mean this is insane and they're now saying we need action as a solid
[02:25:41.120 --> 02:25:46.720]  is hurting people while our government is on record al qaeda is being put in where they tell
[02:25:46.720 --> 02:25:51.040]  fathers we're going to kill you if you don't go suicide bomb and the news remember the new york
[02:25:51.040 --> 02:25:56.720]  times a few months ago ran with some stories about that and then pulled it pulled their own video
[02:25:57.760 --> 02:26:02.160]  because they thought oh look they're making people suicide bomb they're the good rebels
[02:26:02.160 --> 02:26:06.640]  thinking we would go oh yeah that's very moral kind of like when rumsfeld was going yeah we're
[02:26:06.640 --> 02:26:11.760]  torturing people people like really that's illegal oh actually i didn't mean that i mean it's it's
[02:26:11.760 --> 02:26:18.960]  it's bizarro even the nazis didn't admit they were torturing people i mean i mean the are we not
[02:26:18.960 --> 02:26:23.600]  reaching some type of insanity of the ruling class themselves i mean what's going on here gerald i
[02:26:23.600 --> 02:26:31.200]  think you just said it it's insanity and it's insanity to believe for one second that the so-called
[02:26:31.200 --> 02:26:38.880]  ruling class the officials the administrators the presidents the prime ministers their cabinets and
[02:26:38.880 --> 02:26:47.520]  war ministers know what they're doing they failed in afghanistan they failed in iraq look at that
[02:26:47.520 --> 02:26:54.400]  wonderful humanitarian mission that they pulled off in libya oh that was a beaut isn't the freedom
[02:26:54.400 --> 02:27:01.760]  in democracy ringing so beautifully and now as you mentioned they're gearing up to go into syria
[02:27:01.760 --> 02:27:08.080]  and that's where i was going with with eisenhower warning that the military industrial complex
[02:27:08.080 --> 02:27:14.480]  was taking over the nation and that if you want to avoid going over this fiscal cliff try this one
[02:27:14.480 --> 02:27:26.400]  on facades didn't the senate just vote a couple of days ago 98 to 0 for a 631 billion dollar
[02:27:26.400 --> 02:27:33.200]  defense budget 98 to 0 hey we got wars to fight and by the way i believe that was there's gonna
[02:27:33.200 --> 02:27:38.880]  be supplemental as well it's over it's almost two trillion all the different spending this is insane
[02:27:38.880 --> 02:27:45.680]  you cut that you cut that my third problem solved i mean they've got to do it exactly but but what
[02:27:45.680 --> 02:27:51.840]  what are they doing with it blowing each other up over there in detroit with ak-47s you know robin
[02:27:51.840 --> 02:27:57.680]  robin gas stations the country's you know every day you pick up the paper and you see all this
[02:27:57.680 --> 02:28:03.840]  crime and by the way what's going on in europe that's not making the news here my god the crime
[02:28:03.840 --> 02:28:11.680]  rate in in spain in greece the poverty that the people are living in how this thing is collapsing
[02:28:11.680 --> 02:28:20.800]  in front of us i got an idea let's start another war so as you were saying yes it is insanity how
[02:28:20.800 --> 02:28:27.200]  can you expect again the same people that caused the problems to fix them they failed in all these
[02:28:27.200 --> 02:28:32.560]  other wars and now they're going to start another failure and i want to pick up on what you said

[02:34:06.080 --> 02:34:10.000]  let's continue to go through your trends because the war that you've been saying for several years
[02:34:10.000 --> 02:34:16.000]  would come it's definitely going on proxy wars big wars they just call them peace because obama
[02:34:16.000 --> 02:34:22.000]  is a peace prize winner it's all part of the sick joke the torture continues they documented that
[02:34:22.000 --> 02:34:27.120]  in Benghazi there's evidence there was election fraud i'm not saying it doesn't you know that
[02:34:27.120 --> 02:34:33.120]  romney would have saved us it was just the fix was in at every level this is not a mandate for
[02:34:33.120 --> 02:34:38.480]  everything obama is doing nothing but lobbyist nothing but signing statements giant scams
[02:34:38.480 --> 02:34:43.760]  waivers to his buddies from all his laws saying he'll take guns without congressional approval
[02:34:43.760 --> 02:34:49.440]  shutting down power plants without congressional approval signing a cyber security act and not
[02:34:49.440 --> 02:34:55.040]  letting congress see it but then the un brags it gives them the internet i mean things are
[02:34:55.040 --> 02:35:01.520]  exponentially moving quicker to the point of i don't i think i've gotten punched drunk and and
[02:35:01.520 --> 02:35:07.760]  almost you know i am in a learned helplessness state because and i'm informed and it's just
[02:35:07.760 --> 02:35:13.120]  getting crazier by the minute how crazy will it be in another year in three years if we continue
[02:35:13.120 --> 02:35:18.080]  down this road and the bankers are so arrogant they're all over the news going we conquered america
[02:35:19.200 --> 02:35:23.440]  i listen to bloomberg on xm all the time driving home at night and they'll be going don't worry
[02:35:23.440 --> 02:35:28.080]  we'll get a third bailout for ourselves out of europe we're taking over america there's no way we've
[02:35:28.080 --> 02:35:32.000]  got all the pension funds tied up and what we're doing we're telling all the other goldman sex jp
[02:35:32.000 --> 02:35:37.600]  morgan people have all these head guys on bragging how they've got us by the shorthairs just bragging
[02:35:37.600 --> 02:35:43.200]  how they're setting up a corporate world government cnbc ap roiders you read i mean my cruise went up
[02:35:43.200 --> 02:35:48.240]  there three four times to meet with you i've met you in new york but why are they bra i mean i know
[02:35:48.240 --> 02:35:52.560]  you worked around the white shoe boys i mean i guess they are the classic criminals because they
[02:35:52.560 --> 02:35:58.720]  brag about it on top of it jerald i'm ranting go ahead well they're sociopaths and that's the way
[02:35:58.720 --> 02:36:04.960]  they behave and they're money junkies just like any other junkie whether you're on heroin or cocaine
[02:36:04.960 --> 02:36:10.640]  whatever it might be you don't care you just want to get you fixed and then you know the kind of head
[02:36:10.640 --> 02:36:16.480]  that a junkie has that's all they are they're no more than that no less than that now i just want
[02:36:16.480 --> 02:36:22.560]  to stay on syria for one moment because they're doing in iraq with syria they're asking them to
[02:36:22.560 --> 02:36:30.480]  prove the unprovable and the unprovable with syria is are they going to use these chemical weapons
[02:36:30.480 --> 02:36:36.720]  against their people or against other countries and they're using that as an excuse to preempt
[02:36:36.720 --> 02:36:41.520]  an attack just like they did with iraq that's like saying russia we've got to attack you
[02:36:41.520 --> 02:36:46.720]  because you might attack us someday that's what hitler did exactly that's what bush did
[02:36:47.280 --> 02:36:52.240]  with it with it with iraq they attacked the country that said that they didn't have what
[02:36:52.240 --> 02:36:57.200]  america and england and the coalition of the willings said they had they said we don't have them
[02:36:57.200 --> 02:37:01.680]  the weapons inspector said we can't find them oh you can't find them because he won't give them to
[02:37:01.680 --> 02:37:09.360]  you so it's this lunacy it began what you said are they insane yes and what what i'm talking about
[02:37:09.360 --> 02:37:17.440]  and i've been saying and i'm most concerned about is the first great war of the 21st century but i
[02:37:17.440 --> 02:37:23.120]  before i go into that i also want to pick up on what you said about obama getting reelected
[02:37:23.120 --> 02:37:29.120]  and i've been around this thing a long time i've never seen an election that ended with such a
[02:37:29.120 --> 02:37:37.520]  thud like this one the bloom was off the rose immediately there was no post-election high
[02:37:38.240 --> 02:37:48.160]  the dow doll doled about 300 points gold prices shot up 50 points since that time the world equity
[02:37:48.160 --> 02:37:55.200]  markets have been on a downdraft then it was eclipsed with general patreus you remember him
[02:37:55.200 --> 02:38:03.280]  that guy with the boy scouts charm is the toilet paper a record refers to him as we have never seen
[02:38:03.840 --> 02:38:14.720]  a post-election dive emotionally spiritually financially like we're witnessing now and then
[02:38:14.720 --> 02:38:18.880]  go back into the war by the way they can't even just real quick they can't just to back you up
[02:38:18.880 --> 02:38:24.080]  they can't even sell inaugural tickets none of them they can't sell hotel rooms he's so unpopular
[02:38:24.080 --> 02:38:30.720]  but the system knows again they rigged it with romney too it's he didn't even get elected i mean
[02:38:30.720 --> 02:38:35.280]  i've talked to bev Harris all the experts they they are now do you really believe gerald that
[02:38:35.280 --> 02:38:40.400]  california didn't vote to not label gmo i mean give me a break when polls were showing it for a
[02:38:40.400 --> 02:38:46.400]  while two to one for it i mean we're now entering just they are they are absolutely engaging in a
[02:38:46.400 --> 02:38:51.840]  total takeover i'm sorry no i agree with you i don't believe in california vote at all not at all
[02:38:51.840 --> 02:38:56.240]  you know you know i mean come on you know you're gonna save a little couple of pennies by you know
[02:38:56.240 --> 02:39:01.440]  putting i mean who would believe the big companies anyway so no i agree that you know i don't nothing
[02:39:01.440 --> 02:39:09.280]  they do i trust but going back to the great war how much more i'm telling you alex we're watching
[02:39:09.280 --> 02:39:15.120]  very closely what's going on in europe what's going on in italy what's going on what's going
[02:39:15.120 --> 02:39:21.600]  on in spain what's going on in greece what's going on in hungary what's going on in slovenia the
[02:39:21.600 --> 02:39:26.720]  hospitals are shutting down they're burning robberies everywhere basic hygiene at risk and
[02:39:26.720 --> 02:39:30.960]  debt stricken greek hospitals people are dumping their kids on the street it is bedlam and the
[02:39:30.960 --> 02:39:35.920]  bankers are raising taxes knowing it will put the countries in the cardiac arrest so they can buy
[02:39:35.920 --> 02:39:44.960]  everything up it's insane it's insane and it's war and no one will call us spade us economic war
[02:39:45.760 --> 02:39:52.320]  if course it's class war there what different what do you think the arab springs were we wrote
[02:39:52.320 --> 02:39:58.640]  about them before they happened it wasn't a pro democracy movement it was a lot of people that
[02:39:58.640 --> 02:40:05.440]  are tired of not having any money while the top of the pyramids raping everybody else and stealing
[02:40:05.440 --> 02:40:13.680]  all the dough same in tunisia the same everywhere so now we have a war in libya we have a war in
[02:40:13.680 --> 02:40:21.840]  syria we have a war in Bahrain that doesn't make the news there's a war in yemen there's wars now
[02:40:21.840 --> 02:40:30.000]  heating up in jordan they're starting to oppose the king the king i love it you can't call kings
[02:40:30.000 --> 02:40:36.240]  dictators no no man they don't say anything bad about them in years they're not dictators either
[02:40:36.800 --> 02:40:42.800]  so you have all of these dictators that are starting to collapse you have as i said there's
[02:40:42.800 --> 02:40:49.760]  class warfare throughout europe it's going on the people taking to the streets continually the
[02:40:49.760 --> 02:40:58.480]  first great war of the 21st century has begun and now when they go into syria watch out for an
[02:40:58.480 --> 02:41:04.960]  explosion that you're going to start seeing rattle the world you know i have to tell you a quick
[02:41:04.960 --> 02:41:11.040]  story and i'm going to ask my assistant over here to get me that little frame from general
[02:41:11.040 --> 02:41:20.960]  anthony zinni i was asked in 2000 to be the keynote speaker at virginia military institute
[02:41:20.960 --> 02:41:30.080]  the mi you remember that's the place where romney went when he announced what his geopolitical
[02:41:30.080 --> 02:41:37.840]  and foreign policy strategy would be yes i was called down there to be the keynote speaker
[02:41:38.480 --> 02:41:45.600]  to talk about what new millennium warfare would look like this is now 2000 i had written trends
[02:41:45.600 --> 02:41:54.480]  2000 the my national bestseller a warner book now here i am telling now the panel after i speak
[02:41:54.480 --> 02:42:02.400]  included such people as general anthony zinni this is the guy that ran the first iraq war
[02:42:02.400 --> 02:42:08.160]  the gull what was that the first gulf war he was in charge of the troops under schwarzenegger
[02:42:08.800 --> 02:42:13.680]  he's on the panel i'm discussing what new millennium warfare will look like
[02:42:13.680 --> 02:42:19.600]  he has the little note he sent me afterwards gerald thank you for the book and kind note
[02:42:20.160 --> 02:42:26.000]  my mission to the middle east will continue but will be difficult have a great holiday season all
[02:42:26.000 --> 02:42:33.520]  the best tony zinni so here i am telling them what new millennium warfare will look like show us
[02:42:33.520 --> 02:42:37.360]  that book again show us the book again i had something up on screen i don't know that was his
[02:42:37.360 --> 02:42:46.160]  um let's tell me to get the book that this is his um this is his note to me and my book was trends
[02:42:46.160 --> 02:42:53.360]  2000 it was it it was a national bestseller a huge book churno aranis aranis 16 different languages
[02:42:53.920 --> 02:42:58.960]  so now they bring me in to talk about new millennium warfare remember the generals are
[02:42:58.960 --> 02:43:05.040]  bringing me in at vmi to tell them what new millennium warfare will look like because you've
[02:43:05.040 --> 02:43:12.720]  all heard the line the generals are always fighting the last war so when i talk about the great war
[02:43:12.720 --> 02:43:20.720]  of the 21st century here's what it's going to look like it's going to look like dirty bombs going off
[02:43:20.720 --> 02:43:28.320]  in minhatten it'll be new suitcase size nukes going off in itland and obama just said that on
[02:43:28.320 --> 02:43:36.480]  monday he says there's missing nukes missing nukes i got the whole front of this book of all of the
[02:43:36.480 --> 02:43:45.520]  missing weapons of mass destruction and suitcase size nukes that was being sold on the black market
[02:43:45.520 --> 02:43:52.560]  when the soviet union dissolved alexander lebed exposed all that and they blew up his helicopter
[02:43:52.560 --> 02:44:00.800]  you know 20 years late so anyway you're going to see biological warfare you're going to see hell
[02:44:01.600 --> 02:44:08.560]  and what they're going to do as the more of this that happens the more rights they're going to
[02:44:08.560 --> 02:44:17.040]  take away from us under the guise that the psychopaths and sociopaths that started this
[02:44:17.040 --> 02:44:27.040]  are now going to save us alex the first major trend of the new trends journal coming out
[02:44:27.040 --> 02:44:36.000]  the top trends for 2013 is going to be peace and i mean that and we're doing everything and we think
[02:44:36.000 --> 02:44:42.640]  and i'll be discussing it more that we have a real peace plan and something to put into place
[02:44:42.640 --> 02:44:50.400]  because you don't have to listen to me look with your eyes listen with your ears open your mind up
[02:44:50.400 --> 02:44:56.400]  look what's going on around the world look what's going on in this country you can see it collapsing
[02:44:56.400 --> 02:45:05.360]  in front of us the fiscal cliff how about the bottomless pit well said i want to take a few
[02:45:05.360 --> 02:45:09.840]  phone calls as we promised to and we've got you till five hour five after next hour so just about
[02:45:09.840 --> 02:45:14.720]  15 20 more minutes left total here with gerald salenta and there's a few other important points
[02:45:14.720 --> 02:45:19.840]  he needs to get into but the establishment is digging in for a world war three type scenario
[02:45:20.560 --> 02:45:25.440]  now that's exactly all the intel i get the stuff of the information i respect in the film we made
[02:45:25.440 --> 02:45:33.120]  with uh joel scowles and strategic relocation uh max keiser calls them suicide bankers where
[02:45:33.120 --> 02:45:38.560]  there were people in the towers who were there during the crisis making money even after one
[02:45:38.560 --> 02:45:44.080]  tower had collapsed there were people staying in one you know because they were making millions uh
[02:45:44.080 --> 02:45:49.360]  and then again killing themselves to make extra money and you know these guys have so many billions
[02:45:49.360 --> 02:45:56.160]  of dollars a piece uh it's all about because i've read about the way they behave showing off
[02:45:56.160 --> 02:46:00.880]  to the other ones and that guy's got 20 billion i've only got five billion and they're selling
[02:46:00.880 --> 02:46:07.840]  all this fraud and then the police the military they're all trained just to follow it and it is
[02:46:07.840 --> 02:46:13.120]  a kind of a caligula type deal where he marries his his horse uh and then you know makes it the

[02:56:08.480 --> 02:56:13.120]  larry pratt reluctantly he's been forced to say he likes to be classy but the nra has sold us out
[02:56:13.120 --> 02:56:17.760]  in the past they've got some better board members now what do you think of bob costas now saying
[02:56:17.760 --> 02:56:24.560]  hey men 20 to 30 cannot be trusted with guns and he's basically doubled down we played the
[02:56:24.560 --> 02:56:30.880]  clip yesterday and just said ban them all just men cannot be trusted why would i care less what's
