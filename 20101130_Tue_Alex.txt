[00:00.000 --> 00:12.240]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[00:12.240 --> 00:34.480]  he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones
[00:34.480 --> 00:41.240]  it is Tuesday the 30th day of November 2010 can you believe we're about to enter
[00:41.240 --> 00:49.600]  the final month of 2010 and it's 2011 2012 and beyond we've got Wayne Madsen
[00:49.600 --> 00:55.640]  in 30 minutes popping in he's of course work for the NSA the Navy RCA you name it
[00:55.640 --> 01:01.320]  he covers national security and hacking he's gonna give us his view on the
[01:01.320 --> 01:05.480]  WikiLeaks situation I've now had time the last few days really analyze what's
[01:05.480 --> 01:10.960]  happening and I've got my cautious view of exactly what I think's going on here
[01:10.960 --> 01:16.440]  so that's coming up in about 30 minutes we've got Larry Pratt popping in
[01:16.440 --> 01:21.640]  because there's more and more cases of people who have legal guns and have not
[01:21.640 --> 01:27.840]  committed a crime but the neighbors see the guns mommy sees the guns they see
[01:27.840 --> 01:31.840]  TV ads saying report illegal guns and billboards that show images of
[01:31.840 --> 01:36.800]  revolvers they call the police on you and they will call two guns an arsenal
[01:36.800 --> 01:42.440]  there is no law but the juries are so ignorant that they will actually send you
[01:42.440 --> 01:46.680]  to prison and that's in the news today man given seven years in prison for
[01:46.680 --> 01:50.720]  legal guns and I'm seeing more and more of this we've almost had listeners put
[01:50.720 --> 01:57.440]  in prison what was it for six years Kelly rushing lion County Kentucky that
[01:57.440 --> 02:01.120]  was in the newspapers in Kentucky because he gave some state police officers a
[02:01.120 --> 02:05.080]  video with the Ron Paul speech from C-span and my film wrote a tyranny he
[02:05.080 --> 02:12.280]  was charged for the Ron Paul speech and he was charged for the road to tyranny
[02:12.280 --> 02:16.280]  film he was charged for both and it was quote these videos are anti-law
[02:16.280 --> 02:20.560]  enforcement they weren't even really about law enforcement but that shows
[02:20.560 --> 02:25.280]  how crazy some of these people are these judges these prosecutors the bankers
[02:25.280 --> 02:29.720]  can steal trillions and not tell Congress where the money went but if you
[02:29.720 --> 02:32.920]  cover your face while you're being beaten by a billy club as in the case in
[02:32.920 --> 02:36.600]  Florida that just came out yesterday even when the video is released the
[02:36.600 --> 02:41.320]  police say we are charging him with resisting arrest without violence but
[02:41.320 --> 02:44.520]  in the hands over the face you will you will let us beat you even though you're
[02:44.520 --> 02:48.280]  nonviolent it's legal to videotape police all over the country in public
[02:48.280 --> 02:52.720]  places they don't care they will indict you it's not illegal to give somebody a
[02:52.720 --> 02:56.760]  Ron Paul video they don't care they will indict you it's not illegal to own guns
[02:56.760 --> 03:01.560]  they don't care they will indict you now this is not happening everywhere but
[03:01.560 --> 03:05.880]  more and more the authoritarian tyranny is being exercised so that's coming up
[03:05.880 --> 03:10.880]  with Larry Pratt now obviously there's a bunch of other insane news and we're
[03:10.880 --> 03:15.960]  going to be covering it all after this quick break we're gonna get into Wiki
[03:15.960 --> 03:19.160]  leaks we're gonna get into the economy we're gonna get into the article at
[03:19.160 --> 03:24.960]  prisonplanet.com climate alarmist push force relocation at Cancun summit we've
[03:24.960 --> 03:28.560]  been talking about this for two weeks here's the detailed report at prison
[03:28.560 --> 03:34.360] planet.com and info wars.com we've got bizarre statements with the king of
[03:34.360 --> 03:39.920]  Saudi Arabia wanting to microchip terror suspects we've got a lot of key
[03:39.920 --> 03:47.440]  information coming up today here in the broadcast and some new TSA information
[03:47.440 --> 03:52.440]  as that soap opera continues what the New York Times admits is the biggest story
[03:52.440 --> 03:56.120]  of the last year because it's the story of people getting angry and saying no and
[03:56.120 --> 03:59.760]  more polls are out showing that the majority of the population didn't put
[03:59.760 --> 04:03.760]  enough with it and if we can beat them on this absurdity we can stop them on
[04:03.760 --> 04:07.880]  other absurd things they're doing but if they get away with this the sky is the
[04:07.880 --> 04:13.400]  limit so that is coming up but after the break I'm gonna recap again some of
[04:13.400 --> 04:18.560]  what's coming up but then I'm getting in to this key article at prisonplanet.com

[04:27.760 --> 04:32.240]  more history of what's happening throughout the day this is a maximum

[04:46.680 --> 04:51.240]  actually as they said in world war two the fighter pilots the bomber pilots
[04:51.240 --> 04:54.680]  if you're not taking flak you're not over the target so we're really getting

[06:11.880 --> 06:16.160]  much power your electric company allows you to have it's true total government
[06:16.160 --> 06:20.520]  control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming number
[06:20.520 --> 06:24.640]  three in some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously overloaded and
[06:24.640 --> 06:29.160]  now new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem number four
[06:29.160 --> 06:33.280]  dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids every year thousands of
[06:33.280 --> 06:37.280]  families lose their power from weather related onages number five a solar power
[06:37.280 --> 06:41.040]  generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind folks I

[07:09.840 --> 07:14.160]  they'll be pulling the rug from underneath the Americans at home turning
[07:14.160 --> 07:18.800]  menace influence on our president in Congress and they really are calling
[07:18.800 --> 07:24.080]  the shots I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay
[07:24.080 --> 07:28.600]  attention for the republic identifies the enemies of our nation the criminal
[07:28.600 --> 07:33.280]  offshore cartel hell bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes

[08:09.800 --> 08:16.520]  got big news across the board vital information coming up today about 25
[08:16.520 --> 08:20.800]  minutes from now Wayne Madsen is going to join us formally with the NSA reports

[08:24.880 --> 08:30.000]  wiki leaks and what they're up to Larry Pratt pops in to cover this growing
[08:30.000 --> 08:34.880]  phenomenon of people being arrested for legal guns even in their own homes it
[08:34.880 --> 08:39.440]  says a New Jersey man serving seven years for guns he owned legally and
[08:39.440 --> 08:45.360]  that's out of the Philadelphia news Philly dot com so that is coming up
[08:45.360 --> 08:51.720]  of friends and defense a teenage Portland Patsy set up by the FBI more
[08:51.720 --> 08:56.840]  polls out showing that the mass of the public is firmly against the naked
[08:56.840 --> 09:02.400]  body scanners that proves that CBS and NBC have been putting out fake polls NBC
[09:02.400 --> 09:06.920]  claiming 98% support it when all the other scientific polls show the opposite
[09:06.920 --> 09:10.520]  we're gonna be breaking all of that down also climate alarmist push force
[09:10.520 --> 09:17.160]  relocation at Cancun summit detailed report at prison planet dot com also for
[09:17.160 --> 09:20.400]  prison planet dot TV members and this is very important it'll become evident in
[09:20.400 --> 09:25.520]  a moment because the censorship against the other venues we use to get out the
[09:25.520 --> 09:29.960]  truth are being attacked and the system is attempting to shut those down those
[09:29.960 --> 09:34.980]  watering holes where people get reality and key intel dr. Blalock
[09:34.980 --> 09:38.600]  fluoride's deadly secret and he goes into all the soft kill weapons and the
[09:38.600 --> 09:43.280]  food and water and former top brain surgeon retired that is that lengthy
[09:43.280 --> 09:47.840]  hour-plus interview is at prison planet dot TV we flew across the country
[09:47.840 --> 09:52.720]  interview in person also Alex Jones live in Santa Cruz with dr. Stan Monteef
[09:52.720 --> 09:58.160]  Ted Anderson Michael swirling Sheriff Richard Mack and others that's three
[09:58.160 --> 10:03.400]  plus hours long in super high quality high res at prison planet dot TV just
[10:03.400 --> 10:08.000]  went up today and Paul Craig Roberts dr. Paul Craig Roberts how the law was
[10:08.000 --> 10:11.400]  lost now we've got a lawless out of control criminal government these are
[10:11.400 --> 10:14.760]  all sit down in depth never before seen interviews with all of these great
[10:14.760 --> 10:20.960]  individuals at prison planet dot TV right now also got some bad news I was
[10:20.960 --> 10:25.440]  expecting this but as soon as Rand Paul gets in he's set to probably fellow
[10:25.440 --> 10:32.960]  buster in the future if they try to ban a ban on earmarks and he's promised to
[10:32.960 --> 10:38.960]  try to block earmarks but Senate votes down ban on earmarks but that's the
[10:38.960 --> 10:46.160]  lame duck Senate and eight Republicans defected with the Democrats to make sure
[10:46.160 --> 10:53.000]  in that 39 to 56 vote that the hog trough as our country bleeds out
[10:53.000 --> 10:58.280]  financially that the gravy train continues but Politico has the headline
[10:58.280 --> 11:02.640]  strong showing an anti-earmark vote and experts are looking at it saying it may
[11:02.640 --> 11:07.720]  a ban on earmarks may pass in the next Senate coming up in January of next year
[11:07.720 --> 11:12.320]  just about a month and a half away from now we're about to enter December GOP's
[11:12.320 --> 11:16.840]  Cantor says no time to increase taxes on anybody I absolutely agree with that
[11:16.840 --> 11:21.800]  it's the mega elite like Google who pays 2.4% tax because they've written the
[11:21.800 --> 11:26.920]  laws for themselves who lobby and poses liberal Democrats wanting higher taxes
[11:26.920 --> 11:30.200]  on the middle class they tell the working class that somebody make a 200
[11:30.200 --> 11:36.840]  grand a year is rich give me a break in 2010 numbers if you go back to 1960s
[11:36.840 --> 11:42.240]  I've seen the different actuaries on it somebody making $40,000 a year would be
[11:42.240 --> 11:48.000]  basically making $200,000 today now is somebody making $40,000 a year rich the
[11:48.000 --> 11:51.920]  dollar has been devalued you're making millions of dollars a year your new
[11:51.920 --> 11:56.600]  vorice if you're making billions a year your new elite rich if you can have
[11:56.600 --> 12:00.760]  chairs in the private Federal Reserve and literally can print trillions of
[12:00.760 --> 12:06.560]  dollars for yourself your mega inside elite okay so that is just some of what's
[12:06.560 --> 12:11.200]  coming up on that front obviously WikiLeaks of the Second Amendment attacks
[12:11.200 --> 12:17.200]  an amazing video that we posted on prisonplanet.com titled the madness of a
[12:17.200 --> 12:21.760]  lost society I'm gonna be playing that coming up in the next hour it's an
[12:21.760 --> 12:25.320]  article titled Americans are willing to trample one another to get their hands
[12:25.320 --> 12:29.960]  on cheap foreign made plastic garbage even as the United States turns into a
[12:29.960 --> 12:34.520]  post-industrial wasteland and let me tell you driving across Texas to visit
[12:34.520 --> 12:38.840]  family as I do once a year every time I take the same route from Austin to East
[12:38.840 --> 12:43.520]  Texas the towns that I drove through the just five years ago were vibrant you
[12:43.520 --> 12:48.600]  can see them dying and the energy being just sucked out of them and Texas's
[12:48.600 --> 12:52.920]  position better than any other state economically I mean I mean these towns
[12:52.920 --> 12:57.120]  are literally the paint is peeling most the shops are shut down everything is
[12:57.120 --> 13:02.640]  falling apart it just absolutely disgusts me to my core to see this
[13:02.640 --> 13:06.400]  happening but this is globalism and then to watch all these videos on the news
[13:06.400 --> 13:11.880]  of people trampling each other and fighting over you know Black Friday
[13:11.880 --> 13:18.640]  sales tax discounts fighting over crud I mean if I've got to do shopping I
[13:18.640 --> 13:22.400]  certainly don't do it on Black Friday I mean it's worth it to pay the sales
[13:22.400 --> 13:27.640]  tax and not be around hordes of self-propelled stomachs that are you
[13:27.640 --> 13:33.280]  know just just just running around foaming at the mouth to snatch up all
[13:33.280 --> 13:37.520]  the goods they don't care about their liberty the real engine of wealth and
[13:37.520 --> 13:42.520]  dignity and honor they care about crud very powerful video that we're going to
[13:42.520 --> 13:46.300]  be playing I've never seen this channel before and I'm a fan of it now the
[13:46.300 --> 13:51.640]  channel's kind of got a long confusing I mean I mean not confusing handle but
[13:51.640 --> 13:54.040]  hard to remember so I'll just give you one of the video names you can find it
[13:54.040 --> 14:00.000]  easier that way but it is up on prison planet prison planet com guys I forgot
[14:00.000 --> 14:03.160]  to turn my phone off will somebody come grab it and turn it off thank you it's a
[14:03.160 --> 14:10.080]  bit distracting there thank you my fault there okay now let me focus here and
[14:10.080 --> 14:16.400]  give you the big announcement of the day obviously you can go to Alexa or
[14:16.400 --> 14:22.400]  stat brain or Google analytics and look at info wars.com alone it's bigger than
[14:22.400 --> 14:28.240]  Rush Limbaugh site bigger than Limbeck site bigger than MSNBC.com just info
[14:28.240 --> 14:32.880]  wars in fact you can combine some of these mega sites against info wars and
[14:32.880 --> 14:39.280]  info wars.com is bigger okay and the system is fully aware of this and
[14:39.280 --> 14:43.160]  understands then we have prison planet bigger than glenbeck bigger than MSNBC
[14:43.160 --> 14:48.120]  and we've got screenshots of those graphs and breakdowns in this article so the
[14:48.120 --> 14:53.320]  system is fully aware of us conservatively 200 million views in the last
[14:53.320 --> 14:58.320]  two years that number is about six months old so it's much more than that
[14:58.320 --> 15:02.720]  probably 230 million that's again that's conservative just on YouTube now do you
[15:02.720 --> 15:12.080]  think the system likes 200 plus million views on just our channels and allied
[15:12.080 --> 15:15.000]  channels that's just counting a few of our big channels I'm not even trying to
[15:15.000 --> 15:20.040]  count the thousands of others do you think they like 200 plus million people
[15:20.040 --> 15:25.680]  seeing it on one platform that's only one part over 70 AM and FM affiliates
[15:25.680 --> 15:34.360]  not counting micros and pirates global shortwave eight hours a day WWCR XM
[15:34.360 --> 15:41.680]  serious number one on internet streams number one talk show on the web for
[15:41.680 --> 15:46.360]  free streams on the web over 300,000 downloading the podcast every day we
[15:46.360 --> 15:53.640]  conservatively just on the radio show reach more than two million people a day
[15:53.640 --> 15:58.160]  we're now reaching over a million a day just on info wars and prison planet
[15:58.160 --> 16:02.840]  combined this is really scaring the system I'm not here bragging I'm telling
[16:02.840 --> 16:07.240]  you we're in danger we're on the front lines over the enemy over the targets
[16:07.240 --> 16:11.880]  taking heavy flak in ways I'm not even going to get into today I mean they're
[16:11.880 --> 16:16.240]  pulling out all the dirty tricks all the black ops all the psychological warfare
[16:16.240 --> 16:20.400]  and I'm telling you we need to stand up and fight them harder than ever but I'm
[16:20.400 --> 16:25.600]  gonna be honest with you I'm getting up even earlier I got even more energy it's
[16:25.600 --> 16:31.880]  not till I really get persecuted and attacked that I get fired up and I know
[16:31.880 --> 16:35.320]  a lot of you are the same way you got a fighting spirit you've got the love of
[16:35.320 --> 16:40.120]  liberty in your heart and you're beautiful and the real power of info wars
[16:40.120 --> 16:45.160]  calm and prison planet calm and the articles and the films you think info
[16:45.160 --> 16:49.320]  wars and prison planet are big you think the radio shows big it's evergreen it
[16:49.320 --> 16:54.680]  goes on forever globalist lies from a month ago become stale within days what
[16:54.680 --> 16:59.880]  we talk about over the years has that staying power it gets more and more and
[16:59.880 --> 17:07.760]  more and more powerful like pebbles in a pond with the ripples never dissipating
[17:07.760 --> 17:13.400]  and now we're throwing boulders into a pond and it's just causing a massive
[17:13.400 --> 17:20.280]  butterfly effect you can research that physics modeling breakdown dealing with
[17:20.280 --> 17:25.400]  weather if you'd like but but but the the butterfly effect of is is is is
[17:25.400 --> 17:30.560]  applicable to so many other systems in the world so I'm gonna get into all the
[17:30.560 --> 17:37.880]  news but the news is we are under attack and just one of the ways is Watson's
[17:37.880 --> 17:40.480]  article says this happened last week to be technical it happened about two and a
[17:40.480 --> 17:47.000]  half weeks ago Google has blacklisted prison planet calm for eight years
[17:47.000 --> 17:53.360]  prison planet calm all of our articles that we write and post are then put on
[17:53.360 --> 17:59.560]  the Google news feed aggregator not the web people click on the web and they go
[17:59.560 --> 18:03.120]  like it still see your website if you go to Google and type in info wars calm
[18:03.120 --> 18:10.200]  and click web like you click video or places or you understand the links at
[18:10.200 --> 18:14.560]  the top and this is all in the article and some people are confused and they're
[18:14.560 --> 18:18.040]  confused about the YouTube video I put out even though it's crystal clear
[18:18.040 --> 18:26.000]  Google news has banned prison planet from its feed you in over two weeks there
[18:26.000 --> 18:33.200]  are no prison planet or info wars calm articles making it into the feed before
[18:33.200 --> 18:37.160]  in one minute after we publish an article you could type in the headline or
[18:37.160 --> 18:41.480]  something similar into Google click news and you would see our latest articles
[18:41.480 --> 18:48.000]  so we could be on the level playing field with MSNBC Fox CNN national public
[18:48.000 --> 18:51.680]  radio the New York Times the Washington Post the Dallas Morning News the
[18:51.680 --> 18:56.200]  Austin American Statesman and thousands and thousands of other publications
[18:56.200 --> 19:05.240]  BBC Tokyo news all of it China Daily Al Jazeera not anymore they said you're
[19:05.240 --> 19:09.560]  winning you're too effective this is a red game
[19:09.560 --> 19:13.520]  prisonplanet.com and they haven't told us why but we know why we're coming to
[19:13.520 --> 19:18.360]  effective you are banned and we're seeing evidence of the starting to restrict
[19:18.360 --> 19:23.760]  this and push us down in ranking on the regular web link search now it gets
[19:23.760 --> 19:33.200]  worse it gets a lot worse you see this email we got from the official YouTube
[19:33.200 --> 19:38.080]  which is a subsidiary of Google I'm gonna tell you about this they told us that
[19:38.080 --> 19:43.600]  they're going to freeze and it normally happens within a few hours it hasn't
[19:43.600 --> 19:48.760]  happened yet this is officially from YouTube subsidiary of Google that they're
[19:48.760 --> 19:54.800]  going to freeze or they imply shut down the Alex Jones channel or no reason and
[19:54.800 --> 19:58.520]  normally you got to get three strikes they're saying one strike you're out we
[19:58.520 --> 20:04.040]  got to shut Jones down do you have pain from an injury or headache would you
[20:04.040 --> 20:07.600]  like to alleviate that pain in 10 minutes science has now figured out how
[20:07.600 --> 20:11.920]  to put sound frequencies into a kale and clay and polymer gel once applied to the
[20:11.920 --> 20:15.440]  area of injury frequency signals are transmitted that activates the release
[20:15.440 --> 20:19.920]  of prostaglandin hormones your body's own prostaglandin hormones go to work to
[20:19.920 --> 20:24.120]  eliminate inflammation the result is the elimination of pain in 10 minutes for
[20:24.120 --> 20:28.880]  90% of users we have thermography pictures to prove its effectiveness here's
[20:28.880 --> 20:33.200]  what Jody from San Diego had to say I have a weakness in my neck from a car
[20:33.200 --> 20:36.720]  accident about once a month I have neck pain and the only thing that has ever
[20:36.720 --> 20:40.920]  helped is going to the chiropractor to my surprise the knockout pain cream took
[20:40.920 --> 20:45.000]  away the headache and my neck seemed just fine no adjustment required the

[21:09.880 --> 21:14.360]  constitution which protects minority rights not democracy not mob rule two
[21:14.360 --> 21:17.360]  wolves and a sheep voting on what's for dinner so they think they own our land
[21:17.360 --> 21:22.960]  they think they're on our water children our education our money we have to define
[21:22.960 --> 21:27.960]  who we are and what we will tolerate somebody's gonna ask you what you did

[24:06.480 --> 24:09.960]  the GCN radio network
[24:11.480 --> 24:16.600]  so to be clear we have many YouTube channels and we've had fake complaints
[24:16.600 --> 24:20.160]  following them over and over again and when they're successful we just file a
[24:20.160 --> 24:28.160]  counter-demand and in the past they've been forced to reinstate the channel or
[24:28.160 --> 24:33.320]  channels because we filed and agreed to a federal court's jurisdiction and say
[24:33.320 --> 24:38.280]  we're ready to go to court a this isn't a copyright violation or B this isn't
[24:38.280 --> 24:43.960]  vulgar now this time Google admits that they reviewed it and that they think
[24:43.960 --> 24:48.080]  it's a community violation which we've never had before one of those it's not a
[24:48.080 --> 24:53.880]  copyright issue and that because we've challenged it they don't say we were
[24:53.880 --> 24:57.440]  correct or incorrect they say they're gonna shut our channel down for two
[24:57.440 --> 25:02.720]  weeks and they go on to say that they may just suspended all together so in the
[25:02.720 --> 25:07.040]  new America where they operate as this public commons as long as you follow
[25:07.040 --> 25:13.320]  the rules the rules are different for different people so in the same period of
[25:13.320 --> 25:18.960]  time that prisonplanet.com is banned and blocked from the and we've been
[25:18.960 --> 25:22.280]  waiting two weeks watching this it's definitely confirmed and they won't
[25:22.280 --> 25:27.880]  tell us why blocked from prison prisonplanet.com blocked from the Google
[25:27.880 --> 25:34.160]  news feed not the Google web feed the Google news feed that that's so many
[25:34.160 --> 25:38.520]  other news agencies and others research from and more and more we're driving the
[25:38.520 --> 25:42.760]  news the globalists know that we broke the TSA story and pushed it out there
[25:42.760 --> 25:46.280]  and got drudged to pick it up we're the original catalyst with our listeners
[25:46.280 --> 25:50.840]  they're aware of this they're scared of this they know this show has really
[25:50.840 --> 25:56.000]  driven and an energized fledgling movements like 9-11 truth nine plus years
[25:56.000 --> 26:02.600]  ago the system is aware of your efforts my efforts and how effective we are and
[26:02.600 --> 26:07.040]  so here's their letter we'll put it up on screen for prisonplanet.tv viewers
[26:07.040 --> 26:17.640]  we've just blocked out our email and the YouTube copyright specific email and
[26:17.640 --> 26:21.600]  it says here hi there thanks for your email the video you posted was in
[26:21.600 --> 26:24.960]  violation of YouTube's community guidelines as reported by users and
[26:24.960 --> 26:29.520]  verified by YouTube team accordingly the ability to post new content to YouTube
[26:29.520 --> 26:33.920]  from this account has been disabled sometimes it takes a while they haven't
[26:33.920 --> 26:36.960]  done it yet we got this last night and will not return until two weeks after
[26:36.960 --> 26:39.920]  you acknowledge the message within your account well even to get into the
[26:39.920 --> 26:42.120]  account you have to acknowledge it so we've acknowledged it last night about
[26:42.120 --> 26:46.120]  seven I was up here please review the YouTube community guidelines and
[26:46.120 --> 26:49.000]  refrain from further violations which may result the termination of your
[26:49.000 --> 26:55.160]  accounts account accounts additional non-video penalties may be recorded in
[26:55.160 --> 26:59.320]  your account and it goes on now now here was our original response a few weeks
[26:59.320 --> 27:05.040]  ago to this and we explained that there's no vulgarity nothing that many
[27:05.040 --> 27:09.560]  other YouTube sites have posted this including the official CBS news channel
[27:09.560 --> 27:15.720]  the official Al Jazeera the official RT the official CNN the official I mean you
[27:15.720 --> 27:20.120]  name it a beast I mean they're literally hundreds of official channels that show
[27:20.120 --> 27:26.800]  the whole video we showed in our collateral murder video maybe 30 seconds
[27:26.800 --> 27:30.800]  and it's black and white footage of a minivan and you can't even see the
[27:30.800 --> 27:35.200]  people in it being shot I mean this is nothing compared what they put on the
[27:35.200 --> 27:43.960]  news every night and so so we point out to them hey here are all these official
[27:43.960 --> 27:48.320]  news services that are partners with you official partners they're allowed to have
[27:48.320 --> 27:53.800]  hour-long videos not just 15-minute ones and here they are and they've got the
[27:53.800 --> 27:57.800]  same video of the Apache helicopter shooting the Reuters reporter and
[27:57.800 --> 28:01.400]  shooting the minivan with the kids in it we did a report on that and talked
[28:01.400 --> 28:06.720]  about it and you're saying it's vulgar and then we point out that it's on all
[28:06.720 --> 28:10.720]  these other channels and that they're not removing it from any of them and
[28:10.720 --> 28:15.280]  their answer is okay we're shutting your account down you can't use it you can't
[28:15.280 --> 28:24.640]  get information out and if this happens more you're just gone now people point
[28:24.640 --> 28:27.880]  out well they've removed your Obama deception they've you know they've
[28:27.880 --> 28:31.160]  removed a lot of your other stuff before and that's what they're hoping they
[28:31.160 --> 28:36.160]  want to wear you out just like they come out with RFID and the internal industry
[28:36.160 --> 28:39.840]  standards that got leaked a few years ago said 80 plus percent of people don't
[28:39.840 --> 28:44.960]  like this but we don't care our internal research shows people just give up if we
[28:44.960 --> 28:50.240]  just push this through they'll go ahead and submit same thing on the TSA would
[28:50.240 --> 28:53.720]  stick on their hands down your pants same thing with censorship on the web
[28:53.720 --> 28:59.640]  remember the article just last week out of wired censorship bill sales through
[28:59.640 --> 29:03.720]  committee they're trying to pass it this week or next week where the government
[29:03.720 --> 29:08.280]  can just shut down any websites they want no judge no jury just any designate
[29:08.280 --> 29:11.960]  of the Justice Department can shut down any website they want if somebody posts
[29:11.960 --> 29:15.720]  a link on a message board they don't like they're ignoring the DMCA takedown
[29:15.720 --> 29:19.920]  third-party safe harbor meaning if you've got a public site like YouTube or
[29:19.920 --> 29:24.120]  Google or a message board and somebody posts something copyright or whatever
[29:24.120 --> 29:27.600]  they have to contact the site and let them know and they've got a chance to
[29:27.600 --> 29:33.120]  take it down the government says no we'll shut down whoever we want this is
[29:33.120 --> 29:42.600]  all happening now this is all going on now this is a major issue now and we're

[33:21.600 --> 33:26.760]  major educational foundations have admitted that they plan to strangle the
[33:26.760 --> 33:30.640]  internet we've had senator Rockefeller say we'd be better off without an
[33:30.640 --> 33:36.000]  internet we've had him say he wants to shut down Fox News and MSNBC that he
[33:36.000 --> 33:41.840]  wants government-controlled media we have seen the calls for an internet ID
[33:41.840 --> 33:45.720]  Microsoft already designs their computers to do that their operating
[33:45.720 --> 33:51.600]  systems their browsers there is a move towards taxing the web censoring it
[33:51.600 --> 33:56.240]  arbitrary government power to blacklist any websites or shut them down
[33:56.240 --> 34:00.880]  with no judge or jury Australia tried that last year they called it Chinese
[34:00.880 --> 34:08.360]  style net censorship the same thing then is now happening in Europe and happening
[34:08.360 --> 34:17.400]  here so there's a cocktail a whole different squadron of ways that they're
[34:17.400 --> 34:21.120]  doing this and we've broken it down we've warned people they also have internet
[34:21.120 --> 34:27.200]  to a new higher tier of the internet where you have to sign on and agree to
[34:27.200 --> 34:31.800]  waive your rights and where you have a sub domain on a handful less than a
[34:31.800 --> 34:37.480]  hundred megasites and the internet to consortium with government and media
[34:37.480 --> 34:41.760]  meets every year they've got massive funding they fund it through government
[34:41.760 --> 34:45.760]  grants through universities and they have announced this is how the
[34:45.760 --> 34:50.720]  establishment is going to keep controlled so they build the web through DARPA we
[34:50.720 --> 34:56.960]  fund it with our tax money we fund it by our ISP bills by buying computers then
[34:56.960 --> 35:01.960]  once we get addicted they seize it they take control of it the CIA funds groups
[35:01.960 --> 35:07.240]  like Google within QTEL money in its founding 11 years ago to then dominate
[35:07.240 --> 35:11.720]  the architecture of the web so that Google becomes the web and then
[35:11.720 --> 35:18.480]  consensus and control whoever they want this is what's happening this is what
[35:18.480 --> 35:23.640]  they're doing remember two years ago Lieberman came out and said he wants his
[35:23.640 --> 35:29.080]  office to be able to contact YouTube and tell him what to take down and so we
[35:29.080 --> 35:38.280]  are discriminated against by Google's subcompany YouTube by their subsidiary
[35:38.280 --> 35:46.360]  we are held to a higher standard you can have CBS ABC NBC all of them Al Jazeera
[35:46.360 --> 35:55.200]  RT all of them all of them are allowed to post the entire video of people
[35:55.200 --> 36:00.400]  machine gunned from a helicopter compared to even watching a 1950s
[36:00.400 --> 36:06.000]  Western it's not violent because it's black and white it's from a distance we
[36:06.000 --> 36:11.640]  show a snippet and I talk about it and and talk about how the pilots are
[36:11.640 --> 36:16.560]  laughing about it and how that is sick and how the men on the ground are human
[36:16.560 --> 36:20.200]  beings because they're having to see the bleeding children and they tried to
[36:20.200 --> 36:24.900]  save them and get them aid so I pointed out the pilots were disconnected from the
[36:24.900 --> 36:29.560]  killing and the maiming but that the men on the ground were concerned and
[36:29.560 --> 36:35.440]  retained their humanity it was touching what I said it was accurate it was true
[36:35.440 --> 36:41.520]  the video wasn't taken down because it violates their rules it was taken
[36:41.520 --> 36:45.880]  down because it pointed out how sickening it was the pilots enjoying
[36:45.880 --> 36:52.200]  themselves the helicopter pilot in the Apache in the gunner sitting there
[36:52.200 --> 36:56.880]  laughing about it I shouldn't bring a kid to a battle wasn't a battle it was
[36:56.880 --> 37:01.080]  the middle of a major city but the men on the ground are like we've got children
[37:01.080 --> 37:03.560]  we've got to help them and they're running to save them and they did save
[37:03.560 --> 37:06.840]  them when our troops show up and the guys up in the helicopters instead of
[37:06.840 --> 37:12.480]  saying oh man too bad they just laughed about it losing their humanity that's
[37:12.480 --> 37:17.880]  why that video got taken down but the bigger issue is we then challenge it
[37:17.880 --> 37:24.240]  and say here are all these links to major news services and other users that
[37:24.240 --> 37:30.120]  you haven't shut down clearly this is selective enforcement and their answer
[37:30.120 --> 37:33.960]  is hey we're shutting your site down you're not gonna be able to use it no
[37:33.960 --> 37:39.120]  new videos for the next few weeks and we may shut down your whole site with 75
[37:39.120 --> 37:44.520]  million views and it's accelerating that one YouTube site the Alex Jones
[37:44.520 --> 37:48.920]  channel the official Alex Jones channel is now getting about 2 million views a
[37:48.920 --> 37:55.280]  week it's really starting to grow faster like everything else we do and that is
[37:55.280 --> 38:08.800]  what scares of the system that is what concerns them so much now Wayne Madsen
[38:08.800 --> 38:11.680]  always shows up for his interviews but I want to keep covering this and other
[38:11.680 --> 38:15.040]  issues it's kind of fortuitous that we must he must have gotten the time zone
[38:15.040 --> 38:18.400]  confused he'll be on later today on the WikiLeaks situation I'll get into it in
[38:18.400 --> 38:23.200]  a moment but I do need some more time on this web takeover situation so in a way
[38:23.200 --> 38:29.640]  that's for two of us alright now here is the article up at prisonplanet.com and
[38:29.640 --> 38:34.320]  I would imagine since it's been up for an hour it's probably on info wars.com
[38:34.320 --> 38:40.320]  by now let me check and see if it's up there yep Google blacklist prison
[38:40.320 --> 38:47.040]  planet.com obviously it's been more than a week and a half since we've done a
[38:47.040 --> 38:52.720]  top Google search trend which then causes hundreds of other publications to
[38:52.720 --> 38:56.680]  pick up on it like we did over a month ago with top search trend after top
[38:56.680 --> 39:03.160]  search trend about TSA abuse TSA fondling TSA molestation and then
[39:03.160 --> 39:06.320]  drudge picked it up and the rest is history and the New York Times and
[39:06.320 --> 39:11.480]  others have admitted biggest story in recent history we want to make this the
[39:11.480 --> 39:18.040]  top Google search trend hey Google you may ban prison planet completely you may
[39:18.040 --> 39:23.320]  ban info wars.com completely but I'm asking every supporter you're not fans

[39:29.480 --> 39:35.320]  you love freedom I'm asking all YouTube you users to make their own videos we'll
[39:35.320 --> 39:40.280]  post a lot of them on info wars and prison planet to make videos about
[39:40.280 --> 39:44.720]  Google censorship about YouTube censorship and about what they're doing to

[44:09.840 --> 44:13.440]  the next hour if he can do it because this is important I want to get his
[44:13.440 --> 44:19.840]  overall take on the WikiLeaks situation submarine anti-warfare naval
[44:19.840 --> 44:26.560]  command national security agency list goes on and on Wayne Madsen report dot
[44:26.560 --> 44:31.480]  com Wayne give us your view on WikiLeaks because you'd predicted six
[44:31.480 --> 44:34.480]  months ago here that they would shift gears and start going out for
[44:34.480 --> 44:39.840]  corporations but selectively and this is some type of George Soros espionage
[44:39.840 --> 44:45.320]  arm or something give us your view on it Wayne Madsen
[44:45.320 --> 44:51.320]  subject to a huge information warfare operation you know returning to say that
[44:51.320 --> 44:55.800]  this private first-class Bradley Manning with the source for these quarter
[44:55.800 --> 45:00.360]  million latest tranches that quarter million documents of state department
[45:00.360 --> 45:04.440]  cables before with stuff out of the Pentagon out of Afghanistan and Iraq
[45:04.440 --> 45:10.120]  once again this stuff has been free-picked we don't know because they're
[45:10.120 --> 45:15.440]  digital documents how many may have been answered the information appended to
[45:15.440 --> 45:21.960]  these tables but one thing I do know there's a lot of grim faces around the
[45:21.960 --> 45:26.680]  world right now except in one particular country and that's Israel we don't know
[45:26.680 --> 45:33.240]  no benefit we have nothing on them say nothing in these revelations are harmful
[45:33.240 --> 45:37.840]  to us we have a lot of reporting that nothing was revealed about the secret
[45:37.840 --> 45:45.080]  u.s. Israeli communications channels we have the former head of now for
[45:45.080 --> 45:50.640]  we had a must-buy my aunt the guy I'm saying to visit the U.S. Senator John
[45:50.640 --> 45:55.800]  Corbyn in or five at the U.S. and Israel are at war on the need to attack we had
[45:55.800 --> 45:59.960]  Israel admittedly now launched the super worm that our Congress is using to try
[45:59.960 --> 46:05.960]  to take over the web with cyber security right right and we we have the U.S.
[46:05.960 --> 46:11.520]  ambassador in Turkey James Jeffery talking to the Israeli ambassador there
[46:11.520 --> 46:17.280]  Gabby Levy saying over there on the prime minister he he thinks Israel the
[46:17.280 --> 46:23.640]  former minister on the dog autoglue is a little Ottoman it was the fees control
[46:23.640 --> 46:30.080]  every Andalusia Southern Spain this stuff is pure propaganda selectively picked
[46:30.080 --> 46:36.600]  at the very least that answer that the very most and right now I'm looking
[46:36.600 --> 46:41.720]  right now at where that these cables could have originated these obviously
[46:41.720 --> 46:46.400]  came from somebody not learning with a non-hat access to that that yeah this is
[46:46.400 --> 46:49.800]  State Department this is State Department moles these are state
[46:49.800 --> 46:54.360]  Department moles and right now I it's too early and I'm just on this story I'm
[46:54.360 --> 46:59.600]  focusing on a couple a State Department couple a man and a wife both the
[46:59.600 --> 47:06.960]  diplomats are very much tied in with the neocon apparatus in Washington ties to
[47:06.960 --> 47:14.120]  general Petraeus ties to the Israel I'll be here in Washington I'm focusing on
[47:14.120 --> 47:17.880]  that way and that's what I got in the last two days studying this is that it
[47:17.880 --> 47:23.520]  pushes the U.S. towards war it isolates the U.S. to put the U.S. into a neocon
[47:23.520 --> 47:29.360]  paranoia so and then also oh look King Abdullah he wants to attack Iran too oh
[47:29.360 --> 47:34.360]  look Pakistan does have nukes in his dangerous oh look North Korea China
[47:34.360 --> 47:38.320]  wants to cut them loose I mean we know that the diplomatic corps the military
[47:38.320 --> 47:42.560]  corps at the officer level is always being fed in an echo chamber propaganda
[47:42.560 --> 47:45.760]  just because we get all these documents it doesn't mean they're all gospel truth
[47:45.760 --> 47:50.520]  just like these office of special plans that the Pentagon was feeding fake WMD's
[47:50.520 --> 47:53.520]  I agree with you and that's where I was going to go with this and I haven't even
[47:53.520 --> 47:59.640]  talked to you yet but I concur this looks like an Israeli cyber attack with
[47:59.640 --> 48:03.120]  this leak of data to try to hurtle us towards World War three
[48:03.120 --> 48:09.240]  oh and I'll tell you I mean we we see that the couple that I'm focusing on has been
[48:09.240 --> 48:16.080]  involved intimately with the U.S. occupation of Iraq Saudi Arabia at
[48:16.080 --> 48:21.520]  machinations against the Putin government in Russia machinations against
[48:21.520 --> 48:28.240]  North Korea this couple their names come up time and time again do you still say
[48:28.240 --> 48:30.440]  there's a Soros connection to WikiLeaks
[48:30.440 --> 48:37.360]  absolutely because in one particular case one particular U.S. embassy where I
[48:37.360 --> 48:43.880]  know Soros has been very active in Central Asia figures prominently with
[48:43.880 --> 48:48.160]  with the this couple at least one of them one of the members of the
[48:48.160 --> 48:56.080]  American couple on but I think I'm not saying that there's a source of the
[48:56.080 --> 48:59.800]  loop but I bet you anything that the FBI were to be doing which stopped which we
[48:59.800 --> 49:04.360]  know they're not they're too busy Alaska here if I work protested I would be
[49:04.360 --> 49:09.280]  focused on this couple I would I would get a panel of grand jury and get these
[49:09.280 --> 49:14.720]  of this couple in there to testify if they're not the source to find out who
[49:14.720 --> 49:19.480]  is the source what's the cell that's operating who are the other members of
[49:19.480 --> 49:23.200]  the cell and then we can find out who leaked these cables Hillary Clinton can't
[49:23.200 --> 49:28.400]  go there she probably knows but if she utters the I word Israel she can kiss
[49:28.400 --> 49:33.160]  off any future presidential ambitions you know she knows the game she's very
[49:33.160 --> 49:37.040]  well aware of the game that's being played here and that's why she looks so
[49:37.040 --> 49:39.920]  fragile to that news conference yesterday well let's look at the
[49:39.920 --> 49:43.760]  stratagem let's look at the full spectrum stratagem key bono how does
[49:43.760 --> 49:48.640]  Israel benefit well it's real benefits because you've got that the Arab
[49:48.640 --> 49:52.920]  countries that appointing their fingers at each other you got Saudi Arabia and
[49:52.920 --> 49:58.360]  the Gulf States being out it is cooperating with Israel and an attack
[49:58.360 --> 50:03.400]  on Iran that you know they're on the same page on that you've got that Hugo
[50:03.400 --> 50:09.120]  Chavez Christina Kirsten Argentina all people with Israel doesn't like being
[50:09.120 --> 50:14.200]  made to repel these but the key factor this is how I stumbled across this
[50:14.200 --> 50:18.960]  particular couple the revelations from two different embassy two different
[50:18.960 --> 50:23.800]  diplomatic posts about revelations about members of the British royal family
[50:23.800 --> 50:28.560]  look I'm no great fan of the British Royals but we have to realize that they
[50:28.560 --> 50:33.320]  the Queen of England does not like George Soros primarily because he has
[50:33.320 --> 50:37.800]  attempted at least twice in the last 20 years to show at the British town the
[50:37.800 --> 50:44.920]  pound sterling they don't like that he was behind it and Soros has every reason
[50:44.920 --> 50:50.000]  to now repel against the British Royals and again I'm not even judging
[50:50.000 --> 50:55.360]  Sange himself we don't know it but clearly he can just be fed stuff then

[54:00.240 --> 54:10.040]  okay let's go right back to Wayne Madsen formerly with the National Security
[54:10.040 --> 54:12.560]  Agency he's written for many of the biggest publications of the country
[54:12.560 --> 54:18.040]  he has a lot of sources and his intel just continues to be staggeringly
[54:18.040 --> 54:25.360]  accurate now Wayne I know it we're just 48 hours into this really coming out and
[54:25.360 --> 54:30.600]  a lot of things have been happening and going on we know the globalists don't
[54:30.600 --> 54:33.480]  want something of this magnitude coming out they will send a hit team to kill
[54:33.480 --> 54:39.440]  you I don't want to judge Julian Assange without you know total proof but I the
[54:39.440 --> 54:44.080]  whole thing is very suspicious the way this stuff you know always gets spun
[54:44.080 --> 54:49.240]  towards globalist interest not US interest the US folks is just used by
[54:49.240 --> 54:53.240]  this private corporate imperium and I totally agree this whole thing helps
[54:53.240 --> 54:58.160]  Israel that and and you've also got the big banking interest that are in so much
[54:58.160 --> 55:03.400]  trouble that are trying to smoke screen the Europe takeover of Greece and
[55:03.400 --> 55:07.960]  Ireland we know the Rand Corporation wants wars and this thing promotes
[55:07.960 --> 55:12.600]  expanded wars in Pakistan and he stabilizes their government showing the
[55:12.600 --> 55:17.360]  fishers and showing how closely their government's working with the US it it
[55:17.360 --> 55:21.120]  hurts so many allies that are in tenuous continuous situations it
[55:21.120 --> 55:25.080]  destabilizes North Korea further claims the Chinese are ready to cut them loose
[55:25.080 --> 55:29.680]  it makes Israel look good like Israel's wanting to do you know deal swapping
[55:29.680 --> 55:33.240]  land it makes it look like all the other Arab allies are the ones that really
[55:33.240 --> 55:41.720]  want to hit Iran it ratchets that up it seconds you know all of these fables of
[55:41.720 --> 55:46.000]  oh there really are WMD's in Iran and we want to protect the American people but
[55:46.000 --> 55:50.200]  we can't I mean this thing really looks looks like it was written up on a
[55:50.200 --> 55:55.760]  Hollywood Hollywood set well not only that I got some something you'll like
[55:55.760 --> 55:59.600]  this couple I'm focused on both of the members of the council on foreign
[55:59.600 --> 56:06.120]  relations okay so there we go there's the globalist agenda I would also note
[56:06.120 --> 56:11.160]  the two other than the National Security Advisor the two for his
[56:11.160 --> 56:17.280]  prime minister's Ariel Sharon and a who'd Olmer said that this is
[56:17.280 --> 56:24.480]  beneficial to Israel the only ones calling about this right now it just
[56:24.480 --> 56:29.360]  and this idea that Bradley Manning walked in to a skip as a sensitive
[56:29.360 --> 56:35.080]  compartment and information facility with a lady Gaga CD and copied all these
[56:35.080 --> 56:40.760]  not only these documents but all those other ones WikiLeaks has released and
[56:40.760 --> 56:45.160]  the fact that the New York Times reported yesterday that they did not get
[56:45.160 --> 56:48.960]  these documents directly from WikiLeaks but got them from an anonymous
[56:48.960 --> 56:54.320]  intermediary it's thought that the Guardian did it but I thought LeMond
[56:54.320 --> 56:58.480]  the Guardian Spiegel and the New York Times were getting these and paint you
[56:58.480 --> 57:01.560]  know they were getting these from WikiLeaks now we have Bill Keller the
[57:01.560 --> 57:05.160]  editor of the New York Times talking about an anonymous intermediary in New
[57:05.160 --> 57:08.760]  York where's the CFR headquarters headquarters located it's located in
[57:08.760 --> 57:13.040]  Manhattan probably not that far away from the New York Times we don't know a
[57:13.040 --> 57:18.160]  lot about this yet but I think we're going to we're selectively dripping
[57:18.160 --> 57:22.840]  these like Chinese water torture every day we're getting new documents and then
[57:22.840 --> 57:28.680]  we have a sign saying his next target's going to be a large bank there's a
[57:28.680 --> 57:34.160]  feeling that that may be city bank but you know I just like Goldman Sachs and
[57:34.160 --> 57:37.960]  JP Morgan targeted Lehman brothers and others and that's now come out we have
[57:37.960 --> 57:42.560]  been have the big six banks now waging war on each other how did you six months
[57:42.560 --> 57:47.040]  ago and then again two months ago on this show and on your website Wayne how
[57:47.040 --> 57:51.560]  did you say watch he's going to move into corporate stuff and go after George
[57:51.560 --> 57:56.360]  Solrose's competition how did you know that well there's people that I'm
[57:56.360 --> 58:00.320]  talking to that are very suspicious about a sponge ever since he may have
[58:00.320 --> 58:04.920]  been co-opted as an Australian hacker he never served any jail time with the
[58:04.920 --> 58:10.400]  motorcycle M.D.I. of US and Australian intelligence to co-opt these people
[58:10.400 --> 58:15.360]  at the Mossad did it too with some of their hackers a science what we know
[58:15.360 --> 58:19.680]  about a song is a lot of his people with wiki leaks of abandon them there's
[58:19.680 --> 58:22.840]  questions about how he spent the money he's got that thing hanging over his
[58:22.840 --> 58:29.800]  head with in Sweden with the with the molestation of women I mean this is the
[58:29.800 --> 58:34.640]  guy my feeling of the song is a useful idiot here they always use somebody
[58:34.640 --> 58:38.400]  they can destroy at any moment back in 70 seconds with Lane Madsen you don't
[58:38.400 --> 58:47.520]  want to miss this key until you are listening to GCN visit GCN live calm
[58:47.520 --> 58:53.720]  today this is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a
[58:53.720 --> 58:58.080]  solar power generator number one new climate legislation could easily double
[58:58.080 --> 59:02.240]  or triple your electric bill number two our new energies are wants to control
[59:02.240 --> 59:06.280]  how much power your electric company allows you to have it's true total
[59:06.280 --> 59:10.160]  government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is
[59:10.160 --> 59:14.200]  coming number three in some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously
[59:14.200 --> 59:18.600]  overloaded and now new socialist legislation is only compounding the
[59:18.600 --> 59:22.880]  problem number four dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids every
[59:22.880 --> 59:26.600]  year thousands of families lose their power from weather related onages number
[59:26.600 --> 59:30.800]  five a solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of
[59:30.800 --> 59:34.200]  mind folks I really believe in the solar power generators offered by solutions
[59:34.200 --> 59:37.800]  from science one of my oldest sponsors you can get more information at
[59:37.800 --> 59:43.440]  www.mysolarbackup.com that's my solar backup.com remember the government
[59:43.440 --> 59:51.840]  doesn't own the Sun so go to my solar backup.com or call 1-877-327-0365
[59:51.840 --> 01:00:06.160]  waging war on corruption Alex Jones on the GCN radio network big brother
[01:00:06.160 --> 01:00:13.480]  mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he he's
[01:00:13.480 --> 01:00:21.720]  Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones
[01:00:21.720 --> 01:00:26.120]  well Wayne Madson and Wayne Madson report has really been calling it like a
[01:00:26.120 --> 01:00:30.600]  season being very accurate in the years we've been interviewing him and he's on
[01:00:30.600 --> 01:00:34.960]  with us right now if you just join us we're talking about WikiLeaks Israel is
[01:00:34.960 --> 01:00:39.680]  crowing in many news publications that they're the winners from this just like
[01:00:39.680 --> 01:00:44.800]  major Israeli newspapers admitted that oh yeah Israel launched the super high-tech
[01:00:44.800 --> 01:00:51.640]  worm against Iran and oh now our government months later doesn't point out
[01:00:51.640 --> 01:00:55.040]  that that's on record they say oh we've got to take over the web and take your
[01:00:55.040 --> 01:01:01.080]  freedoms because of the Stuxnet worm and it's the same thing here and the big
[01:01:01.080 --> 01:01:05.200]  globalist interest in others they want wars they want to go after North Korea
[01:01:05.200 --> 01:01:08.200]  I'm no fan of North Korea folks but we don't need a new war the Rand
[01:01:08.200 --> 01:01:16.440]  Corporation two years ago told the CFR you need something bigger than the Iraq
[01:01:16.440 --> 01:01:19.840]  War to be able to complete this world government this corporate world
[01:01:19.840 --> 01:01:24.080]  government so you notice everything is accelerating right now everything is
[01:01:24.080 --> 01:01:27.480]  getting crazier by the day and that's because we're entering one of those
[01:01:27.480 --> 01:01:31.520]  serious times in history when economies start imploding and the elites are
[01:01:31.520 --> 01:01:36.280]  consolidating control World War one World War two and now the day they start
[01:01:36.280 --> 01:01:41.240]  major wars Wayne Madsen do you agree with that statement oh absolutely you
[01:01:41.240 --> 01:01:45.880]  know and this isn't the first time the State Department has experienced that a
[01:01:45.880 --> 01:01:52.160]  cell operating within its own ranks we know about Algeria back there the
[01:01:52.160 --> 01:01:57.720]  early days of the Cold War we know about Felix Block in the 1980s who was spying
[01:01:57.720 --> 01:02:02.360]  for the for the Soviets he was a State Department employee in Vienna and we
[01:02:02.360 --> 01:02:07.160]  have a cell operating within the State Department this poor PFC manning I'm
[01:02:07.160 --> 01:02:12.280]  easy he's a patsy in every sense of the word just like we Harvey Oswald was at
[01:02:12.280 --> 01:02:18.400]  the but we've got we've got these useful idiots like a sponge and and others who
[01:02:18.400 --> 01:02:25.800]  are basically pushing me the story that came from a lady Gaga CD in the
[01:02:25.800 --> 01:02:31.680]  nonsense whatever goes into it doesn't leave if it's a magnetic or optical
[01:02:31.680 --> 01:02:36.640]  recording of you know people that told me that nothing was changed on those
[01:02:36.640 --> 01:02:43.040]  policies and another thing if no one started downloading new documents the
[01:02:43.040 --> 01:02:48.680]  first the security officer would have been alerted to that immediately would
[01:02:48.680 --> 01:02:53.440]  have inquired what's going on well they have alarms on those systems that's
[01:02:53.440 --> 01:02:57.560]  admitted as you know you work for the NSA I mean they have to go through
[01:02:57.560 --> 01:03:02.800]  procedures on each document to even allow the computer to copy it right so
[01:03:02.800 --> 01:03:06.920]  you've got you've got an audit for somebody accessing and then the minute
[01:03:06.920 --> 01:03:12.680]  they start to copy that's another audit trigger that's that's tripped so so the
[01:03:12.680 --> 01:03:18.240]  idea that manning did this is nonsense there's they set this guy up I'm not
[01:03:18.240 --> 01:03:22.040]  saying he squeaky clean he might have taken a few things out but he certainly
[01:03:22.040 --> 01:03:27.480]  I don't know how he would have done it without being you know discovered
[01:03:27.480 --> 01:03:32.600]  this week is coming from authorized people within the State Department people
[01:03:32.600 --> 01:03:36.920]  who would have had had access to that much information we've got cables going
[01:03:36.920 --> 01:03:42.960]  back to 1985 all the way up to this year this is a tremendous amount of
[01:03:42.960 --> 01:03:47.800]  information but the people who would have had access to it would have had to
[01:03:47.800 --> 01:03:51.640]  had all you know pretty hot isn't this part of the ongoing program of
[01:03:51.640 --> 01:03:55.240]  demonization of the United States we're now entering this phase where we're
[01:03:55.240 --> 01:03:59.440]  gonna be blamed for the world financial meltdown I mean this is the offshore
[01:03:59.440 --> 01:04:04.320]  banks preparing us to take the blame oh absolutely you know and I have to say
[01:04:04.320 --> 01:04:09.040]  that I'm I can feel for Hillary Clinton right now she probably knows what's
[01:04:09.040 --> 01:04:13.440]  going on but I'll tell you what pro bono I would go to the State Department if
[01:04:13.440 --> 01:04:17.640]  they give me access there I can sit there and show them what I've got and who
[01:04:17.640 --> 01:04:22.880]  they should be looking at and they're obviously trying to find out where these
[01:04:22.880 --> 01:04:27.040]  leaks came from I would do that free charge it's only a few miles from where
[01:04:27.040 --> 01:04:30.680]  I live here in Washington but you know they're not they're not going to want
[01:04:30.680 --> 01:04:35.120]  me there just like a sponge in an email from some years ago when it was
[01:04:35.120 --> 01:04:38.920]  suggested I might be a member of the board of directors the wiki leaks that
[01:04:38.920 --> 01:04:42.840]  no not that he might have been good once we don't want him now because I would
[01:04:42.840 --> 01:04:46.920]  have smelled this guy and it's out immediately stay there let's cover any
[01:04:46.920 --> 01:04:52.280]  other angles and and and what you think is most important in these leaks then
[01:04:52.280 --> 01:04:57.120]  we've got Larry Pratt of Gunners of America popping in they're now arresting

[01:08:11.400 --> 01:08:15.360]  okay Wayne Madson the Wayne Madson report.com is our guest formerly with the
[01:08:15.360 --> 01:08:19.600]  NSA just excellent intel up on the hill and at the press club from his other
[01:08:19.600 --> 01:08:25.560]  NSA and CIA sources current and former he's been calling WikiLeaks as a George
[01:08:25.560 --> 01:08:30.880]  Soros globalist operation for a long time predicted they would move in against
[01:08:30.880 --> 01:08:35.520]  banks and institutions the globalists want to shut down now Assange has
[01:08:35.520 --> 01:08:38.880]  announced that's where they're going next clearly this was not stolen from
[01:08:38.880 --> 01:08:43.880]  one military base communicates from the State Department going back a quarter
[01:08:43.880 --> 01:08:49.160]  century this this is really a rigged situation now there's no doubt and I
[01:08:49.160 --> 01:08:55.440]  agree with him Assange is a useful idiot I don't believe that he's a bad guy we
[01:08:55.440 --> 01:09:00.400]  don't have evidence of that but but all of this stuff is clearly propaganda and
[01:09:00.400 --> 01:09:03.560]  we're gonna recap that get any other any other facets of Wayne Madson here in
[01:09:03.560 --> 01:09:09.520]  just a moment I got bad news for you two weeks ago the Food Safety Act written by
[01:09:09.520 --> 01:09:13.360]  big agribusiness to openly shut down family farms people even grow in their
[01:09:13.360 --> 01:09:19.400]  own grapes their own tomatoes and selling them to people it just gives open
[01:09:19.400 --> 01:09:25.320]  ended unlimited power for the FDA to just take over and shut down and find and
[01:09:25.320 --> 01:09:30.200]  fee whatever they want just like Wired magazine not Alex Jones I mean I gave
[01:09:30.200 --> 01:09:34.320]  you the same analysis months ago but last week they admitted web censorship
[01:09:34.320 --> 01:09:38.320]  bill sales through committee and they believe that's gonna pass in the lame
[01:09:38.320 --> 01:09:43.720]  duck now just like two weeks ago we said it looks like this bill will now pass
[01:09:43.720 --> 01:09:49.160]  because they've got the votes after it went out of committee so Senate passes
[01:09:49.160 --> 01:09:53.680]  overhaul of food safety regulations they're set to pass giving the Justice
[01:09:53.680 --> 01:09:59.040]  Department unlimited Stalinistic mal-power to literally shut down any
[01:09:59.040 --> 01:10:03.800]  website anytime with no proof no nothing no judge no jury no due process
[01:10:03.800 --> 01:10:09.480]  that set to pass more banker bailouts set to pass they are just destroying this
[01:10:09.480 --> 01:10:13.840]  country right now we've got to repeal all this coming up in the next session
[01:10:13.840 --> 01:10:17.280]  just because they pass it doesn't mean they're gonna be able to implement it you
[01:10:17.280 --> 01:10:22.200]  can grow dates you can grow oranges you can grow apples you can sell them to your
[01:10:22.200 --> 01:10:26.240]  neighbors you can slice them up and can them the government can't stop you this
[01:10:26.240 --> 01:10:30.680]  is illegal they're criminals and I don't care what laws they pass I'll have any
[01:10:30.680 --> 01:10:34.720]  garden I want and I'll sell it to anybody I want and it's big agribusiness
[01:10:34.720 --> 01:10:38.760]  that wrote this to shut down their competition Senate passes overhaul of
[01:10:38.760 --> 01:10:43.120]  food safety regulations despite unusual bipartisan support on Capitol Hill and a
[01:10:43.120 --> 01:10:46.680]  strong push from the Obama administration the bill could still die
[01:10:46.680 --> 01:10:50.600]  because there might not be enough time for the usual haggling between Senate
[01:10:50.600 --> 01:10:53.440]  House representatives here's the problem that's a that's a that's a New
[01:10:53.440 --> 01:10:58.200]  York Times thing to pacify you okay because here's the bad news here's the
[01:10:58.200 --> 01:11:02.480]  daily caller hot Mike picks up discussion on Senate floor quote it's all
[01:11:02.480 --> 01:11:07.320]  rigged hot Mike left on this just came out minutes ago Senate vote Tuesday it's
[01:11:07.320 --> 01:11:11.640]  this is going up on in fours right now hot Mike left on during a Senate vote
[01:11:11.640 --> 01:11:15.920]  Tuesday morning on the food safety act caught a senator complaining that the
[01:11:15.920 --> 01:11:21.360]  process of setting the agenda during the lame duck session is rigged and it was
[01:11:21.360 --> 01:11:25.920]  senator from Colorado Democrat senator Michael Bennett talking to Lieberman and
[01:11:25.920 --> 01:11:30.320]  and they've never done this before they're doing things in procedural rules
[01:11:30.320 --> 01:11:36.040]  now where it is a dictatorship there's no debate on any of this stuff not we're
[01:11:36.040 --> 01:11:39.740]  gonna go to wait in a minute but here's the short clip of senator Democratic
[01:11:39.740 --> 01:11:44.200]  senator from Colorado senator Michael Bennett saying it's all rigged it's just
[01:11:44.200 --> 01:11:50.840]  all being rammed through here it is because because it's all rigged I mean
[01:11:50.840 --> 01:11:54.560]  the whole conversation right there were conversations the fact that we don't get
[01:11:54.560 --> 01:11:59.440]  to a discussion before the break about what we're gonna do in the lame duck it's
[01:11:59.440 --> 01:12:08.440]  just rigged this stuff's rigged this stuff's rigged this stuff is rigged
[01:12:08.440 --> 01:12:14.600]  Wayne Madsen what's your take on that oh of course it's right look this is what a lame duck
[01:12:14.600 --> 01:12:22.280]  Congress is doing you know I mean look you know where's Obama he's busy playing
[01:12:22.280 --> 01:12:26.720]  basketball with Fort McNair and getting you know getting elbowed or hit by a
[01:12:26.720 --> 01:12:32.320]  fist I mean as you know this guy and now we've got the weekly standard certainly
[01:12:32.320 --> 01:12:36.080]  not one of my favorite magazines saying reporting this week that this guy
[01:12:36.080 --> 01:12:40.040]  separates from the narcissistic syndrome I mean this guy loves the
[01:12:40.040 --> 01:12:43.840]  attention but he doesn't want to do he doesn't want to do the job of being the
[01:12:43.840 --> 01:12:47.480]  president of the United States which is more than just going out and getting
[01:12:47.480 --> 01:12:52.680]  getting applauded and and you know high-fiving it with it with people out
[01:12:52.680 --> 01:12:57.640]  there on the campaign trail being president takes a lot more than just
[01:12:57.640 --> 01:13:02.800]  being a darn television celebrity absolutely we've only got a minute or
[01:13:02.800 --> 01:13:08.720]  two left Wayne any other leads you're working on on the WikiLeaks mega fiasco
[01:13:08.720 --> 01:13:12.760]  well I want to point out on Manning remember the guy that turned him in with
[01:13:12.760 --> 01:13:18.240]  the WikiLeaks guy named Adrian Lamo he turned him into the FBI here we have
[01:13:18.240 --> 01:13:24.000]  like a smoking gun on setting this poor guy up the leaks didn't come from him
[01:13:24.000 --> 01:13:29.480]  they're from inside the State Department I worked in computer security at the
[01:13:29.480 --> 01:13:33.320]  State Department in the Bureau of Diplomatic Security I know that to get
[01:13:33.320 --> 01:13:37.960]  that much information out there if it's if it's valid and I probably a lot of it
[01:13:37.960 --> 01:13:41.960]  is we don't know how many of these digital documents may have been altered
[01:13:41.960 --> 01:13:47.440]  or forged but that takes that takes somebody within at a very high level
[01:13:47.440 --> 01:13:51.360]  within the State Department that's the source that's where the FBI should be
[01:13:51.360 --> 01:13:55.560]  looking that's where the Justice Department should be looking but don't
[01:13:55.560 --> 01:13:59.240]  don't think Eric Holder the Attorney General is going to look to where the
[01:13:59.240 --> 01:14:05.600]  real criminals are he's nothing more than a front man for these people just
[01:14:05.600 --> 01:14:10.760]  like his boss Barack Obama is and just like the director of the FBI fact it
[01:14:10.760 --> 01:14:14.800]  came out that the current head of the Justice Department was the instrumental
[01:14:14.800 --> 01:14:18.440]  front man as Deputy Attorney General with the Oklahoma City cover-up Wayne
[01:14:18.440 --> 01:14:22.280]  Madsen thank you for the report we'll talk to you again very soon all right
[01:14:22.280 --> 01:14:25.280]  there's Wayne Madsen I tend to agree with everything he's saying and he's got
[01:14:25.280 --> 01:14:29.440]  the intel sources and when he talks about continues to be born out over and
[01:14:29.440 --> 01:14:36.840]  over again I wanted to briefly get Larry Pratt on from gun owners of America
[01:14:36.840 --> 01:14:43.880]  today up at Philly.com family New Jersey man serving seven years for guns he
[01:14:43.880 --> 01:14:50.600]  owned legally and I see these kind of reports all the time the guy had gotten
[01:14:50.600 --> 01:14:54.440]  divorced his wife wouldn't let him see his kids he was a professional guy with
[01:14:54.440 --> 01:14:58.400]  no criminal record he was staying at his mom's house he said oh his life even
[01:14:58.400 --> 01:15:02.040]  worth living he didn't threaten to commit suicide she calls the police they
[01:15:02.040 --> 01:15:06.520]  come SWAT team find two guns in his car in the trunk legally he gets seven years
[01:15:06.520 --> 01:15:12.480]  in prison here's another one Obama nominates rabid anti gunner to head
[01:15:12.480 --> 01:15:16.080]  the Bureau of Alcohol Tobacco and firearms and explosives that's from gun
[01:15:16.080 --> 01:15:22.200]  owners of America that's a report out there so I wanted to briefly look at
[01:15:22.200 --> 01:15:28.920]  this ongoing march against the Second Amendment but I see these cases every
[01:15:28.920 --> 01:15:31.600]  few weeks without even looking I'll see an article out of New Jersey or
[01:15:31.600 --> 01:15:36.680]  Massachusetts or California I mean you see them where it's almost always a
[01:15:36.680 --> 01:15:41.560]  carpet cleaner or a neighbor or a plumber it's almost always some old vet
[01:15:41.560 --> 01:15:45.720]  with no criminal record done nothing wrong volunteers locally they'll be I've
[01:15:45.720 --> 01:15:48.600]  seen a lot of cases where they're tinkering in their garage cleaning guns
[01:15:48.600 --> 01:15:52.520]  and or their poor dear hunters putting a gun in their truck to go hunting and you
[01:15:52.520 --> 01:15:55.800]  hear about them getting SWAT team and they'll report the guns were legal but
[01:15:55.800 --> 01:15:59.280]  they've been confiscated and they've been charged with an arsenal and then they
[01:15:59.280 --> 01:16:02.920]  never even have a law what's an arsenal I've seen as little as two or three guns
[01:16:02.920 --> 01:16:08.600]  and a thousand rounds of ammo called an arsenal I mean this is just incredible
[01:16:08.600 --> 01:16:15.720]  that this type of thing is going on and and it's another example of people
[01:16:15.720 --> 01:16:19.880]  doing nothing wrong but the juries are so stupid that they will charge you with
[01:16:19.880 --> 01:16:26.200]  something totally separate from what the supposed crime even is and they do
[01:16:26.200 --> 01:16:32.200]  this over and over and over and over again if we can't get proud on ISD
[01:16:32.200 --> 01:16:37.440]  unless you do telephone no big deal no big deal okay continuing here Obama
[01:16:37.440 --> 01:16:43.360]  nominates rabid anti-gunner to head the ATF it was not a good sign that Barack
[01:16:43.360 --> 01:16:49.800]  Obama kept his nominee to head the BATF firearms and explosives a secret unit
[01:16:49.800 --> 01:16:53.920]  after the midterm election and then quickly announced that the anti-gun
[01:16:53.920 --> 01:16:59.280]  zealot Andrew F. Traver would be named to fill the slot after being blasted
[01:16:59.280 --> 01:17:02.960]  before the November election by the liberal New York Times for failing to
[01:17:02.960 --> 01:17:07.400]  beef up the ATF by appointing a director for fear of the wrath of the gun lobby
[01:17:07.400 --> 01:17:13.240]  Obama gets right past the election in presto change yo a nominee appears how
[01:17:13.240 --> 01:17:17.720]  about that and not just any nominee a special agent in charge of Chicago
[01:17:17.720 --> 01:17:22.360]  that's where they it's almost always some old 80-something year-old it I see
[01:17:22.360 --> 01:17:26.520]  it all the time literally in fact there have been a lot of cases old World War
[01:17:26.520 --> 01:17:30.440]  2 vets won't renew their their their their their gun card you got to get it
[01:17:30.440 --> 01:17:33.920]  every year and they swat team they don't call them and say hey come do this or
[01:17:33.920 --> 01:17:37.560]  give them a ticket no they swat team them and the feds run all that to the
[01:17:37.560 --> 01:17:41.440]  state police a special agent in charge of the Chicago's ATF that's the most
[01:17:41.440 --> 01:17:45.040]  vicious in the country field division Traver had taken the lead in calling for
[01:17:45.040 --> 01:17:50.240]  a ban on semi-automatic rifles period not just you can't sell them anymore you
[01:17:50.240 --> 01:17:55.000]  gotta turn them in I mean they're now appointing somebody who openly wants
[01:17:55.000 --> 01:18:01.280]  your guns and wants your guns now we're gonna go to Larry Pratt now Larry Pratt
[01:18:01.280 --> 01:18:05.760]  head of gun owners of America gun owners dot org great to have you on sir good
[01:18:05.760 --> 01:18:08.800]  to be with you Alex thanks so much you bet we're going to break in a minute but
[01:18:08.800 --> 01:18:13.920]  let's cover this new nominee just absolutely anti-second amendment
[01:18:13.920 --> 01:18:21.000]  absolutely one of the clearest ways we know is that while he was out in the
[01:18:21.000 --> 01:18:25.040]  Chicago office of the Bureau of Alcohol tobacco firearms and explosives he
[01:18:25.040 --> 01:18:31.120]  attended and participated in a Great Lakes State Summit on firearms violence
[01:18:31.120 --> 01:18:37.280]  they produced a document taking a stand reducing gun violence in our communities
[01:18:37.280 --> 01:18:44.040]  and it's a list that the Brady campaign would be just very happy that no more
[01:18:44.040 --> 01:18:49.120]  anonymous sales so the government will know everybody who bought a gun and what
[01:18:49.120 --> 01:18:54.160]  kind of a gun well they in other words he's for gun registration we have too
[01:18:54.160 --> 01:18:58.440]  much of it as it is when we go to a dealer this would eliminate private sales
[01:18:58.440 --> 01:19:02.920]  and that's something the Brady campaign's been after for a long time they
[01:19:02.920 --> 01:19:06.560]  wanted to end this report they wanted to get rid of our semi-automatic that
[01:19:06.560 --> 01:19:12.280]  basically redo the Clinton gun ban and that means grandpa can't give grandson
[01:19:12.280 --> 01:19:18.920]  a 22 when he's ten under that transfer law absolutely if my neighbor says hey
[01:19:18.920 --> 01:19:23.560]  I really like that shotgun I can't sell it to him I have to go through a dealer
[01:19:23.560 --> 01:19:29.480]  and then the record is established you know there's nothing in our Constitution
[01:19:29.480 --> 01:19:34.720]  that says the government the federal government has authority in the area of

[01:24:27.640 --> 01:24:34.000]  okay we only got about five minutes with Larry Pratt and I'm getting into the
[01:24:34.000 --> 01:24:38.200]  economy the censorship against prisonplanet.com what's happening with
[01:24:38.200 --> 01:24:43.120]  North Korea Larry let's let's get into this individual how we keep them from
[01:24:43.120 --> 01:24:48.360]  becoming the new head of the ATF and also this report is getting so much
[01:24:48.360 --> 01:24:52.720]  attention mainstream news New Jersey man serving seven years for guns he owned
[01:24:52.720 --> 01:24:59.080]  legally well for stopping this guy Traver I'm not sure that we're gonna have
[01:24:59.080 --> 01:25:03.920]  the ability to do that because it looks as if Obama is going to use a recess
[01:25:03.920 --> 01:25:10.680]  appointment and that would enable him to serve basically for all of 2011 of
[01:25:10.680 --> 01:25:16.080]  course if the Congress does away with the BATF that would take care of Mr.
[01:25:16.080 --> 01:25:21.320]  Traver's problem and he could go and maybe he can find a job as a real cop
[01:25:21.320 --> 01:25:30.400]  now the guy in New Jersey it's really an extremely infuriating thing that they
[01:25:30.400 --> 01:25:34.960]  would even bring that charge here's a guy that went out of his way to find out
[01:25:34.960 --> 01:25:40.400]  what the law was he was moving to the state from Colorado where there's a
[01:25:40.400 --> 01:25:47.160]  relative amount of freedom regarding Second Amendment and he was in the
[01:25:47.160 --> 01:25:53.760]  process of getting all the paperwork done in Jersey but he didn't have a
[01:25:53.760 --> 01:26:00.400]  permit to own the gun and that's what they nailed him on even though he wasn't
[01:26:00.400 --> 01:26:05.480]  robbing a bank he wasn't doing anything wrong it's just that in New Jersey they
[01:26:05.480 --> 01:26:09.560]  don't like you having a gun unless they know you bought the gun because you have
[01:26:09.560 --> 01:26:14.680]  a firearms owner identification certificate and for that at that alone
[01:26:14.680 --> 01:26:20.080]  he's going to serve more time if the governor doesn't grant him clemency than
[01:26:20.080 --> 01:26:23.720]  a lot of people that commit murder
[01:26:24.440 --> 01:26:30.920]  continuum it is something that I think people can have something we can do in
[01:26:30.920 --> 01:26:36.320]  the case of the Jersey because there we could contact Governor Christie and
[01:26:36.320 --> 01:26:44.640]  Trenton and urge him to give this guy clemency and I think Christie who's
[01:26:44.640 --> 01:26:50.840]  not pro second amendment but I think he might well respond to an obvious I mean
[01:26:50.840 --> 01:26:57.200]  what good is society getting out paying for this guy's incarceration for seven
[01:26:57.200 --> 01:27:03.880]  years when he didn't harm anybody he didn't commit any real crime so I think
[01:27:03.880 --> 01:27:10.080]  contacting Governor Chris Christie Trenton New Jersey is the way to go I've
[01:27:10.080 --> 01:27:15.400]  also in closing seen an intensification by the Justice Department claiming that
[01:27:15.400 --> 01:27:19.480]  all the violence in Mexico is caused by our second amendment but then I've
[01:27:19.480 --> 01:27:22.920]  actually looked at the Justice Department's own numbers they admit that
[01:27:22.920 --> 01:27:27.040]  most the weapons being used by drug cartels are being bought from the
[01:27:27.040 --> 01:27:31.720]  Mexican military they're fully auto German weapons they've also caught former
[01:27:31.720 --> 01:27:36.040]  Navy SEALs and people in the US shelling hand grenades and weapons to the
[01:27:36.040 --> 01:27:41.040]  Mexican drug cartels there are some guns coming out of the US to Mexico but
[01:27:41.040 --> 01:27:45.000]  those are what citizens are getting to protect themselves I mean it's
[01:27:45.000 --> 01:27:49.400]  incredible Larry how they spin this we have a country with a total gun ban for
[01:27:49.400 --> 01:27:54.240]  citizens it's a lawless hellhole 28,000 dead in the last two years and the
[01:27:54.240 --> 01:27:58.920]  government tries to ban our second amendment claiming that it's causing
[01:27:58.920 --> 01:28:04.960]  problems in Mexico the idea that a grenade launcher is something that what
[01:28:04.960 --> 01:28:08.800]  you just walk into the gun show and I'll take two of those I'm on my way down to
[01:28:08.800 --> 01:28:14.880]  Mexico it doesn't work that way this is not something that's available to
[01:28:14.880 --> 01:28:18.400]  people certainly not readily and the paperwork that would entail would be
[01:28:18.400 --> 01:28:24.600]  enormous it doesn't happen and this is as you say it's coming mostly from the
[01:28:24.600 --> 01:28:28.600]  Mexican military and my guess is that if it's not being sold out of their
[01:28:28.600 --> 01:28:34.640]  armories directly it comes when some 150,000 men have deserted the Mexican
[01:28:34.640 --> 01:28:40.960]  army and the idea that they would have to work on a onesie-toosie gun up for
[01:28:40.960 --> 01:28:46.240]  the drug warriors when they got airplanes flying in drugs right now don't
[01:28:46.240 --> 01:28:52.040]  think there's any room in there for a case or two of AK come on 500 billion
[01:28:52.040 --> 01:28:55.440]  dollars a year is estimated to be brought through heroin cocaine and
[01:28:55.440 --> 01:28:59.640]  marijuana out of Mexico alone if they're making a big cut of 500 bill you
[01:28:59.640 --> 01:29:04.880]  think they can buy a few weapons I I think they could probably do you know
[01:29:04.880 --> 01:29:10.320]  what Alex I think they would do it for cash no records well I mean they're
[01:29:10.320 --> 01:29:14.280]  already gonna fly in cocaine of course they're gonna fly in weapons you and I
[01:29:14.280 --> 01:29:20.160]  go to a store and we get all registered up so we might as well use our credit
[01:29:20.160 --> 01:29:23.880]  card when they do it no records no questions here's the cash everybody's
[01:29:23.880 --> 01:29:28.320]  happy yeah why couldn't we buy a gun the same way a crook can't there's
[01:29:28.320 --> 01:29:32.560]  something wrong with exactly crooks aren't gonna fall along get rid of all

[01:30:39.640 --> 01:31:03.600]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a
[01:31:03.600 --> 01:31:07.600]  solar power generator number one new climate legislation could easily
[01:31:07.600 --> 01:31:11.640]  double or triple your electric bill number two our new energies are wants
[01:31:11.640 --> 01:31:15.560]  to control how much power your electric company allows you to have it's true
[01:31:15.560 --> 01:31:19.200]  total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid
[01:31:19.200 --> 01:31:23.600]  technology is coming number three in some areas of the country the power grid
[01:31:23.600 --> 01:31:28.400]  is dangerously overloaded and now new socialist legislation is only compounding
[01:31:28.400 --> 01:31:32.160]  the problem number four dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids
[01:31:32.160 --> 01:31:35.640]  every year thousands of families lose their power from weather related
[01:31:35.640 --> 01:31:39.560]  challenges number five a solar power generator provides powerful backup

[01:33:02.600 --> 01:33:09.000]  crashing through the lies and disinformation it's Alex Jones on the
[01:33:09.000 --> 01:33:18.480]  GCN radio network well here's some of the news we've got climate alarmist push
[01:33:18.480 --> 01:33:23.600]  for force relocation at Cancun summit we've now gotten a detailed report
[01:33:23.600 --> 01:33:27.120]  out on this I've been covering in the last few weeks and showing you the report
[01:33:27.120 --> 01:33:31.040]  itself but now Watson has written a detailed article at prisonplanet.com
[01:33:31.040 --> 01:33:35.960]  and info wars.com ahead of the attempt to set up the global carbon tax world
[01:33:35.960 --> 01:33:40.840]  government regime now cooking off in a few days just two days from now in
[01:33:40.840 --> 01:33:44.840]  Mexico running for almost two weeks now that report is at prisonplanet.com
[01:33:44.840 --> 01:33:54.160]  it's also at GCN live.com GCN live.com which is the network site but more
[01:33:54.160 --> 01:33:57.640]  and more we're using it as an auxiliary because just because Google's banned
[01:33:57.640 --> 01:34:01.960]  prisonplanet now info wars from Google news feeds and you click on you know
[01:34:01.960 --> 01:34:05.120]  Google and click news and start to our headlines you can't get them going back
[01:34:05.120 --> 01:34:09.000]  two weeks not only are they trying right now to shut down our channel and
[01:34:09.000 --> 01:34:14.160]  openly telling us that on YouTube with millions of views a week 75 million views
[01:34:14.160 --> 01:34:19.000]  so far of the other channels over 230 million in the last two years that's
[01:34:19.000 --> 01:34:22.800]  conservative I've been saying 200 million for six months it's well over 230
[01:34:22.800 --> 01:34:29.480]  million so all of that is happening and it's because we're covering real issues
[01:34:29.480 --> 01:34:35.120]  so I would add for Aaron let's make sure we have it posted at GCN live.com so
[01:34:35.120 --> 01:34:38.760]  that even though Google's gonna when people search it and find out that the
[01:34:38.760 --> 01:34:43.520]  number one search term today thanks to our great listeners who've never failed
[01:34:43.520 --> 01:34:47.160]  it will be Google blacklist prisonplanet.com those terms together

[01:35:35.680 --> 01:35:41.560]  food safety act the food safety regulations really were written by a big
[01:35:41.560 --> 01:35:46.520]  agribusiness who causes the lion's share of food poisonings with salmonella and
[01:35:46.520 --> 01:35:49.880]  other problems that's on record and it's just so draconian I want to be
[01:35:49.880 --> 01:35:57.280]  covering some of that coming up but again I just briefly wanted to remind
[01:35:57.280 --> 01:36:03.680]  folks this is big news and we got the email from the official fact I'm looking
[01:36:03.680 --> 01:36:08.400]  for the email now well we can put it back up on screen for viewers so I can
[01:36:08.400 --> 01:36:12.000]  read it as well in fact just just put back up on screen for me guys Google
[01:36:12.000 --> 01:36:16.960]  blacklistprisonplanet.com and when you scroll down you can see the email to our
[01:36:16.960 --> 01:36:23.920]  channel and we saw this last night it actually came in yesterday morning but
[01:36:23.920 --> 01:36:27.440]  Aaron saw it last night at about seven I was still here at the office and he
[01:36:27.440 --> 01:36:31.560]  notified me and I went back there and read it and sometimes it takes a day
[01:36:31.560 --> 01:36:35.920]  usually it's a few hours for them to shut down or lock down a channel it has
[01:36:35.920 --> 01:36:40.400]  not happened yet and so I ran in here at about eight at night shot a five minute
[01:36:40.400 --> 01:36:47.480]  video breaking down the fact that they told us hey look you showed a short
[01:36:47.480 --> 01:36:53.320]  clip by the way we put this video up over six months ago of the Apache
[01:36:53.320 --> 01:36:57.160]  helicopter shooting up the Reuters reporter and the minivan they're like
[01:36:57.160 --> 01:37:04.240]  little black dots down the street being shot I mean it's nothing and we
[01:37:04.240 --> 01:37:08.040]  countered back to them saying you're gonna do this to our channel and we
[01:37:08.040 --> 01:37:12.120]  counterclaimed and said this is on Al Jazeera this is on CNN this is ABC CBS I
[01:37:12.120 --> 01:37:16.120]  mean there's literally hundreds of news agencies with the whole video and they
[01:37:16.120 --> 01:37:22.160]  blew it up I talk about the video and go look at the troops look at the troops
[01:37:22.160 --> 01:37:26.040]  the troops on the ground going save the wounded children and point out that this
[01:37:26.040 --> 01:37:30.480]  was wrong and then the helicopter pilots make jokes about it and I said that
[01:37:30.480 --> 01:37:34.560]  shows how they're removed from the death but the troops that are actually seeing
[01:37:34.560 --> 01:37:39.280]  the kids you know all shot up they have humanity and I and I just said shame on
[01:37:39.280 --> 01:37:44.880]  those helicopter pilots that's why they banned the video we had the video banned
[01:37:44.880 --> 01:37:48.640]  where I showed the puppy being thrown off the cliff by the troops all the other
[01:37:48.640 --> 01:37:52.240]  news agencies were allowed to have it we couldn't have it because we pointed out
[01:37:52.240 --> 01:37:55.520]  how we're dehumanized people don't feel empathy when they see humans being
[01:37:55.520 --> 01:38:00.480]  killed but they got upset about dogs my issue wasn't really about the troops it
[01:38:00.480 --> 01:38:06.240]  was about the psychology we had a problem with that a few years ago so I I
[01:38:06.240 --> 01:38:10.760]  just remembered that we had this happen before so they use anything they white
[01:38:10.760 --> 01:38:15.440]  glove inspect us other people's you know things to be a pig's die we do
[01:38:15.440 --> 01:38:19.880]  anything they're moving to shut us down it could happen any time they might
[01:38:19.880 --> 01:38:23.280]  shut it down completely they said they might just freeze it for two weeks show
[01:38:23.280 --> 01:38:27.960]  that millions of people every week that get their news off that can't get it
[01:38:27.960 --> 01:38:32.320]  quite frankly that will just make us make more money but that's not my goal
[01:38:32.320 --> 01:38:37.040]  you know prison planet TV members know that almost everything that goes on
[01:38:37.040 --> 01:38:42.120]  prison planet TV then a week or so later goes on our channels sure you get it in
[01:38:42.120 --> 01:38:45.320]  higher quality you get it all in one place you get books you get other
[01:38:45.320 --> 01:38:48.160]  films were not authorized to put on YouTube other people's films that
[01:38:48.160 --> 01:38:52.720]  authorizes to post it on prison planet TV 595 a month it's really just like a
[01:38:52.720 --> 01:38:56.120]  donation to help pay for the bandwidth and pay for the rest the operation we
[01:38:56.120 --> 01:38:59.280]  appreciate you but everybody knows you can get it on the Alex Jones channel and
[01:38:59.280 --> 01:39:05.520]  our listeners lovingly support prison planet TV to get it first to get it in
[01:39:05.520 --> 01:39:11.040]  one spot but also to support us so shutting down our channel which we hope
[01:39:11.040 --> 01:39:14.960]  doesn't happen because our goals to get the word out all that's going to do is
[01:39:14.960 --> 01:39:19.560]  make tens of thousands of people come sign up at prison planet TV so you know
[01:39:19.560 --> 01:39:24.000]  God turns every attack into a blessing no weapon formed against us so prosper and
[01:39:24.000 --> 01:39:27.560]  I you know reading that in Sunday schools a little kid I didn't understand it but
[01:39:27.560 --> 01:39:31.120]  in my life every time bad things happened to us and I just continue and
[01:39:31.120 --> 01:39:35.280]  don't back down other doors open that are even bigger and better to get the
[01:39:35.280 --> 01:39:38.680]  word out we are so blessed we are having such a huge effect it is so
[01:39:38.680 --> 01:39:44.600]  wonderful and I am thankful I am thankful I am appreciative of you the
[01:39:44.600 --> 01:39:47.680]  listeners and everything we've done together but I want to hit Google and
[01:39:47.680 --> 01:39:52.000]  hit them hard today I want to make one search term Google blacklist prison
[01:39:52.000 --> 01:39:56.840]  planet calm those three words Google blast prison planet calm put it into the
[01:39:56.840 --> 01:40:00.440]  search engine over and over again right now folks don't count on others but I
[01:40:00.440 --> 01:40:07.320]  also want to make I want to make another search term number one and that's
[01:40:07.320 --> 01:40:15.800]  Google is evil their motto is don't be evil well Google is evil they disguise
[01:40:15.800 --> 01:40:19.400]  themselves they are an NSA CIA front we told you that six years ago with former
[01:40:19.400 --> 01:40:24.160]  CIA Intel officers experts in technology we had on now it's mainstream news and
[01:40:24.160 --> 01:40:28.720]  they're there in 11 years gobbling up the entire web taking over the entire
[01:40:28.720 --> 01:40:32.280]  internet and I'm not going to put up with it and I'm asking listeners to take
[01:40:32.280 --> 01:40:36.440]  our article to cover what's in it take snippets of the video or the whole video
[01:40:36.440 --> 01:40:42.320]  I posted while our channel still there and to get it out to everyone and to make
[01:40:42.320 --> 01:40:46.240]  your own YouTube videos about them censoring prison planet calm they are
[01:40:46.240 --> 01:40:50.000]  probing they are testing us they are trying to wear us out they're trying to
[01:40:50.000 --> 01:40:53.200]  always attack every few months so you get sick of hearing about it just oh
[01:40:53.200 --> 01:40:55.920]  that's what they're gonna do and start just giving in and thinking it's a
[01:40:55.920 --> 01:41:00.120]  foregone conclusion this is psychological warfare you've got to say not only are
[01:41:00.120 --> 01:41:06.360]  we gonna fight you we like fighting you come on give me more I like it they
[01:41:06.360 --> 01:41:09.760]  can't beat that spirit folks resistance is victory the globalists know that
[01:41:09.760 --> 01:41:13.040]  that's why they're all hyped up they're arrogant they never stop but when you
[01:41:13.040 --> 01:41:20.800]  keep pushing and don't stop they get scared oh I'm weak oh I mean look we've
[01:41:20.800 --> 01:41:28.480]  got the power we are in the right and don't stop don't stop don't ever stop
[01:41:28.480 --> 01:41:35.000]  but info wars.com prison planet.com there is no doubt they are at the tip of the
[01:41:35.000 --> 01:41:38.720]  spear and the globalists know that if they can blunt that they can slow us
[01:41:38.720 --> 01:41:41.720]  down but their outrageous crimes are so legion they're not getting away with
[01:41:41.720 --> 01:41:45.680]  any of this for all their arrogance and all their bravada and all their
[01:41:45.680 --> 01:41:50.240]  imperial hubris they are going to fail if you don't lay down in the ditch and
[01:41:50.240 --> 01:41:55.120]  lick their boats I've seen the films and photos out of
[01:41:55.120 --> 01:42:02.480]  Soviet Russia China Africa Nigeria just where people they've got hundreds of
[01:42:02.480 --> 01:42:05.360]  people lined up on the street there's only a few guards there they're like you
[01:42:05.360 --> 01:42:11.120]  look like they're 15 official government guards this is all over the major news
[01:42:11.120 --> 01:42:15.160]  channels on YouTube but we know better if I show you a clip of this now we post
[01:42:15.160 --> 01:42:19.880]  it on YouTube they'll take the site down but but you just just just search the
[01:42:19.880 --> 01:42:26.840]  term Nigerian executions and you see these people it's Christians executing
[01:42:26.840 --> 01:42:30.000]  Muslims and I'm against Muslims killing Christians and they do it too and then
[01:42:30.000 --> 01:42:33.320]  Christians kill Muslims it's wrong but for anybody and they're just lining them
[01:42:33.320 --> 01:42:36.800]  up and they take them in the street and have them lay down so they don't look
[01:42:36.800 --> 01:42:39.560]  them in the eyes and they shoot them and there's people standing there with
[01:42:39.560 --> 01:42:43.880]  shops and alleys they could run for it if all of them ran for it they probably
[01:42:43.880 --> 01:42:49.040]  only be able to shoot a third of them but I would charge the people with guns
[01:42:49.040 --> 01:42:54.200]  I would fight back but in Germany in Russia in China in Nigeria most people
[01:42:54.200 --> 01:42:58.800]  lay down I mean I've seen the film footage I know you've seen it as well on
[01:42:58.800 --> 01:43:02.320]  the Eastern Front with the Nazis stripping down women and children and
[01:43:02.320 --> 01:43:08.000]  little kids with pigtails you know that you know that it just tears my guts out
[01:43:08.000 --> 01:43:12.640]  and they march them into pits and just shoot them and and I watch the men sit
[01:43:12.640 --> 01:43:15.200]  there while their kids are being let let away to be shot and the men just get
[01:43:15.200 --> 01:43:21.800]  down on their knees and I mean I would attack I would I would act weak and then
[01:43:21.800 --> 01:43:26.200]  just just literally just literally bite the throat out of people and by the way
[01:43:26.200 --> 01:43:30.160]  you can do that if you just turn it loose physically it's the same thing with
[01:43:30.160 --> 01:43:36.680]  info war if you just get down in dirty folks you can just break people's arms
[01:43:36.680 --> 01:43:40.440]  in a fight if you turn off the switch that that that is a governor you can
[01:43:40.440 --> 01:43:44.680]  just break people it's the same thing in the info war I mean you know what you
[01:43:44.680 --> 01:43:49.360]  can do with your bare hands really most people hold back folks it's the same
[01:43:49.360 --> 01:43:53.640]  thing societal info war you must command respect you must command leadership
[01:43:53.640 --> 01:43:57.520]  you must know you have the truth you must be leaders you must be bold you
[01:43:57.520 --> 01:44:03.080]  must be fearless you must never stop in the face of this tyranny or give in to
[01:44:03.080 --> 01:44:07.800]  these people I will not lay there in a ditch and be machine gun in the back I
[01:44:07.800 --> 01:44:11.920]  will not lay there in the ditch if they come try to take my house I will not
[01:44:11.920 --> 01:44:17.320]  lay there in the ditch and they try to take my children I'm done ladies and
[01:44:17.320 --> 01:44:23.000]  gentlemen we'd show it to you but I guarantee a PBS and you know all these
[01:44:23.000 --> 01:44:26.320]  nature sites on YouTube they're allowed to show it but I guarantee they shut my
[01:44:26.320 --> 01:44:31.280]  channel down if I showed you next it'll probably if I talk about it if I showed
[01:44:31.280 --> 01:44:42.520]  you the films of water buffalo if I showed you the films of of other animals
[01:44:42.520 --> 01:44:47.280]  giraffes you name it at watering holes and a lot of times when a lion comes up
[01:44:47.280 --> 01:44:57.960]  and grabs a baby whether it's a water buffalo or a wilder beefed or zebras I've
[01:44:57.960 --> 01:45:06.120]  seen a lot of these films the the other animals will run up in mass and attack
[01:45:06.120 --> 01:45:09.960]  the lions and then a group of about in one video of eight big lions run out to
[01:45:09.960 --> 01:45:13.080]  fight them and the zebras don't care the giraffes don't care these are all
[01:45:13.080 --> 01:45:16.400]  different videos I've seen and they all just attack and start kicking and it
[01:45:16.400 --> 01:45:19.640]  start attacking and even in one video kill one of the lions that are just
[01:45:19.640 --> 01:45:26.560]  stomping on it wildly animals have this basic instinct I mean where do you see
[01:45:26.560 --> 01:45:35.600]  an animal so maybe a rabbit where do you see an animal that when a prey animal
[01:45:35.600 --> 01:45:40.160]  the prey animal would be a rabbit that gives in that that when a predator comes
[01:45:40.160 --> 01:45:47.200]  in and tries to grab them they don't fight back I mean if you don't fight
[01:45:47.200 --> 01:45:51.560]  back at least with words folks the sky's the limit of how bad these people are
[01:45:51.560 --> 01:46:01.000]  gonna rape us and it is not heroic it is not tough it is not extraordinary for
[01:46:01.000 --> 01:46:05.320]  me to sit here and say if I was in Soviet China or communist China Soviet
[01:46:05.320 --> 01:46:12.280]  Russia Nazi Germany Nigeria and they were trying to lead people in and shoot
[01:46:12.280 --> 01:46:15.960]  them in the back of the head and I was next in line I would I would immediately
[01:46:15.960 --> 01:46:21.080]  elbow the guy in the nose and it probably still machine gun me but then
[01:46:21.080 --> 01:46:26.520]  other people would fight behind me and and could get away or get a gun and
[01:46:26.520 --> 01:46:31.720]  fight back but over and over again I see people who lay down what is your
[01:46:31.720 --> 01:46:35.680]  problem I know right now most Americans would sit there while the
[01:46:35.680 --> 01:46:39.240]  government blew their children's heads off and do nothing about it what is your
[01:46:39.240 --> 01:46:42.760]  problem what is wrong with you what did they do to you we've been raking
[01:46:42.760 --> 01:46:45.680]  fluoride you've been getting injected with mercury you've been eating GMO I
[01:46:45.680 --> 01:46:49.320]  understand that but you've got to fight through the poisoning and get your
[01:46:49.320 --> 01:46:55.720]  humanity back and at least stand up and speak out oh my gosh I got a bunch of
[01:46:55.720 --> 01:47:00.720]  economic news here it's all just completely insane gold is exploding
[01:47:00.720 --> 01:47:04.160]  again they've been trying to suppress it they can't the dollar goes up on the
[01:47:04.160 --> 01:47:07.720]  news of the Korea situation as the world gets scared now it starts going back
[01:47:07.720 --> 01:47:11.520]  down I wanted to bring Ted Anderson up Ted what's the latest economic news you
[01:47:11.520 --> 01:47:16.840]  got in front of you well right now the IMF is backing off on their sales because
[01:47:16.840 --> 01:47:20.400]  the central banks want to start accumulating that back again gotta be
[01:47:20.400 --> 01:47:23.800]  clear they've been selling it quietly to try to drive the price down they have
[01:47:23.800 --> 01:47:27.160]  been and now you know even there they realize their own currencies are
[01:47:27.160 --> 01:47:31.360]  faltering I mean for God's sakes could you imagine being China right now watching
[01:47:31.360 --> 01:47:35.440]  what's going on in Europe I mean now we've got we got Portugal we've got
[01:47:35.440 --> 01:47:40.960]  Spain both in trouble and so it from the Chinese perspective they're watching
[01:47:40.960 --> 01:47:45.960]  the West just you know take the suicide pill and drive their currencies right
[01:47:45.960 --> 01:47:49.720]  into the ditch I mean it's like a fast race right now the dollar is stronger
[01:47:49.720 --> 01:47:53.280]  today and the only reason why it's stronger today is because the euro is
[01:47:53.280 --> 01:47:57.320]  falling faster than the dollar is and gold is reflecting it all gold is running
[01:47:57.320 --> 01:48:03.120]  up it's almost at $1400 an ounce had a high today of 1391 I mean that's what's
[01:48:03.120 --> 01:48:07.160]  going on in gold and silver gold and silver is real money it has value it
[01:48:07.160 --> 01:48:11.400]  doesn't matter what's going on out there and when they go on when Bernanke is
[01:48:11.400 --> 01:48:15.440]  turning on the printing process to $600 billion what do you think is going to
[01:48:15.440 --> 01:48:19.880]  happen to gold I mean it's reflecting it right now the everything is just you
[01:48:19.880 --> 01:48:24.200]  know the Europe Europe is dying the United States is going to see all these
[01:48:24.200 --> 01:48:28.600]  crises being accelerated the global banks openly gobbling up Ireland now
[01:48:28.600 --> 01:48:32.520]  admitting foreign banks now dominate them they're basically planning their
[01:48:32.520 --> 01:48:36.200]  flag and urinating on the Irish people and we're next Ted they're gonna move
[01:48:36.200 --> 01:48:39.080]  through Europe and then to the United States they announced yesterday all the
[01:48:39.080 --> 01:48:42.080]  austerity they're gonna cut the veterans health care and their pensions
[01:48:42.080 --> 01:48:45.680]  they're gonna cut the federal workers people like why aren't you for that no
[01:48:45.680 --> 01:48:49.600]  first you get the big bankers that have created the mess and stolen trillions and
[01:48:49.600 --> 01:48:53.840]  you write off all that debt that they've created artificially that's where the
[01:48:53.840 --> 01:48:58.400]  that's the black hole I hear all these fake conservatives praising all these
[01:48:58.400 --> 01:49:03.040]  big cuts you watch you mark my words this isn't gonna fix anything it's not
[01:49:03.040 --> 01:49:07.040]  designed to fix anything now everything's got to go to the bankers that's why
[01:49:07.040 --> 01:49:10.680]  this is happening it is going that direction Alex you just simply the
[01:49:10.680 --> 01:49:15.440]  United States government can't fix this problem by cutting back on expenses it
[01:49:15.440 --> 01:49:19.880]  has to actually get away from this debt-based fiat system that we're in
[01:49:19.880 --> 01:49:24.680]  because we have a compounding problem the interest has been adding to it since
[01:49:24.680 --> 01:49:30.280]  1913 it's becoming bigger and more ferocious as time goes on the appetite
[01:49:30.280 --> 01:49:33.960]  is growing it's not shrinking and it's going to consume us and that's just the
[01:49:33.960 --> 01:49:38.360]  way it is you have to get away from a fiat system if you don't want to have
[01:49:38.360 --> 01:49:42.260]  compounding interest working against you right now I mean it's simple as this the
[01:49:42.260 --> 01:49:45.520]  Fed right now is buying us government treasuries to try to stimulate the
[01:49:45.520 --> 01:49:49.200]  economy which is putting the United States taxpayers deeper and deeper in
[01:49:49.200 --> 01:49:54.080]  debt I mean why can't people see this of course they're trying to drive the
[01:49:54.080 --> 01:49:56.720]  interest rates down and they're trying to get this money to the people at the
[01:49:56.720 --> 01:50:00.920]  bottom and it's not happening because the central banks are giving the money to
[01:50:00.920 --> 01:50:03.800]  their their member banks the member banks are buying us government
[01:50:03.800 --> 01:50:07.160]  treasuries with us absolutely they're hoarding it for themselves while
[01:50:07.160 --> 01:50:11.000]  shutting down Main Street and they're getting record bonuses I mean they're
[01:50:11.000 --> 01:50:15.000]  absolute criminals there's a bunch of special gold and silver offers only
[01:50:15.000 --> 01:50:19.200]  available to radio listeners on silver half dollars full silver dollars they've
[01:50:19.200 --> 01:50:23.680]  got silver dollar deals or you can get my films free they've got great deals on
[01:50:23.680 --> 01:50:31.600]  Frank's on sovereigns on all sorts of gold coins 806 age 62237 is the toll
[01:50:31.600 --> 01:50:34.920]  free number to call I would say purchase the gold and silver to support the
[01:50:34.920 --> 01:50:38.840]  network on the show but at these prices I see the margins there's almost no
[01:50:38.840 --> 01:50:44.440]  profit plus Ted buys when it's low sells low when it's high so it's incredible
[01:50:44.440 --> 01:50:50.880]  800 686 2237 I want to give folks a brief menu on the other side Ted if some
[01:50:50.880 --> 01:50:54.320]  of the special offers you've got then we'll let you go and I'll get into all
[01:50:54.320 --> 01:50:57.520]  the legislation they're passing right now during the lame duck more on the

[01:54:23.920 --> 01:54:29.440]  including internet total censorship and takeover I've got some key videos and
[01:54:29.440 --> 01:54:33.000]  audio I want to play I want to get into the the day after Thanksgiving Black
[01:54:33.000 --> 01:54:39.840]  Friday hysteria and this beautiful piece of work that's been done on YouTube
[01:54:39.840 --> 01:54:45.400]  that really illustrates everything we're facing in in in four beautifully put
[01:54:45.400 --> 01:54:51.440]  minutes so that's coming up a jam-packed third hour but going back to Ted
[01:54:51.440 --> 01:54:55.640]  Anderson Ted I mean everybody says they're getting people good deals on
[01:54:55.640 --> 01:55:02.760]  golden silver and I've seen people that do kind of the bait and switches you know
[01:55:02.760 --> 01:55:06.240]  who every once in a while I can find something lower but whenever I contact
[01:55:06.240 --> 01:55:10.240]  them they're out of it when you say you've got this golden silver at these
[01:55:10.240 --> 01:55:14.120]  prices when most people have run out or most people don't have it or they've
[01:55:14.120 --> 01:55:19.800]  got huge premiums I mean when you say that you've got this stuff on hand you
[01:55:19.800 --> 01:55:24.880]  do and those are the deals while sure as what I what I quote a price Alex we
[01:55:24.880 --> 01:55:28.320]  made a commitment to that price if somebody comes in and buys something
[01:55:28.320 --> 01:55:33.080]  it's going to be that price whether if gold sits at this 1390 level or jumps
[01:55:33.080 --> 01:55:37.680]  up to 1425 they're going to get what they ordered at the price they ordered it
[01:55:37.680 --> 01:55:41.240]  and it's going to come in a timely fashion and they're going to find that
[01:55:41.240 --> 01:55:45.560]  it's secure that it's insured that it's everything's done professionally here
[01:55:45.560 --> 01:55:50.600]  up by this there is just you know we we take such great care to absolutely and
[01:55:50.600 --> 01:55:53.480]  anybody that does a big volume of business over the years will you know
[01:55:53.480 --> 01:55:58.760]  make people angry but there are very few gold outfits in fact I haven't seen
[01:55:58.760 --> 01:56:02.520]  another that has a triple a better business Bureau rating like you do I
[01:56:02.520 --> 01:56:06.000]  know there's some other reputable groups that my family over the years is used
[01:56:06.000 --> 01:56:10.920]  and my family's very happy and they've got bad ratings because you get hundreds
[01:56:10.920 --> 01:56:13.960]  of thousands of customers over the years some of them are going to get mad some
[01:56:13.960 --> 01:56:16.400]  are going to be weird some of them are going to be unstable and they're going
[01:56:16.400 --> 01:56:21.880]  to go complain my just resources as a triple a better business Bureau rating
[01:56:21.880 --> 01:56:27.640]  I feel very good promoting the deals you have briefly Ted tell folks some of the

[02:00:23.840 --> 02:00:30.360]  ladies and gentlemen we've got breaking news on the Google Trends issue it's
[02:00:30.360 --> 02:00:34.840]  got to be over 50 times you've made search terms that we put out number one
[02:00:34.840 --> 02:00:39.120]  prisonplanet.com was delisted from Google news feeds we've been there eight
[02:00:39.120 --> 02:00:43.200]  years they're trying to shut down our YouTube channel for no reason we've
[02:00:43.200 --> 02:00:49.400]  covered that earlier and I went to check Google Trends and I noticed that it said
[02:00:49.400 --> 02:00:54.520]  Google Trends down top Google Trends are a day behind that's out of the Huffington
[02:00:54.520 --> 02:01:04.240]  Post the examiner innovative it's November 29th 2010 and so I guess they've
[02:01:04.240 --> 02:01:09.200]  just shut it down because we're using it and other people are using it I'm not
[02:01:09.200 --> 02:01:23.320]  sure what's going on but this is this is bizarre wow this is crazy so I guess we
[02:01:23.320 --> 02:01:26.720]  won't have the number one terms today unless it's all backing up there's some
[02:01:26.720 --> 02:01:29.920]  problem and then it comes out we're number one don't worry Google will hit
[02:01:29.920 --> 02:01:35.600]  you with Google is evil and prison planet black lucid by Google will hit you
[02:01:35.600 --> 02:01:38.360]  with all that as soon as your trends come back up I know they're in there
[02:01:38.360 --> 02:01:42.920]  trying to figure out how to stop us and that's probably what this is I mean you
[02:01:42.920 --> 02:01:47.360]  notice we launched the whole TSA thing a prophet has not known his own country I
[02:01:47.360 --> 02:01:50.520]  guess the Bible says and some people who've been listening to us for years
[02:01:50.520 --> 02:01:55.960]  don't realize that this show the websites the films it's not even about Alex

[02:02:18.360 --> 02:02:21.960]  losers and quitters never win how's the saying going I sound like George Bush

[02:03:20.720 --> 02:03:26.280]  detailed report on all of this but it's important I think for him to add to his
[02:03:26.280 --> 02:03:32.800]  report that this is a big deal and this is all part of the constellation of
[02:03:32.800 --> 02:03:39.880]  internet censorship and clampdown and crackdown that's happening right now but

[02:07:20.360 --> 02:07:25.720]  think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention for

[02:07:30.640 --> 02:07:35.040]  hell bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world

[02:08:14.800 --> 02:08:23.440]  teacher bands pencils from class cited as potential weapon making that's what
[02:08:23.440 --> 02:08:28.360]  the AP Reuters are reporting on Matt Ryan wrote a story about it at info wars
[02:08:28.360 --> 02:08:36.200]  dot com teacher bands pencils from class cited as potential weapon making
[02:08:36.200 --> 02:08:41.720]  remember in 1984 you're not allowed to have a pencil or a journal and of course
[02:08:41.720 --> 02:08:46.600]  next will they ban pins because they're pointed next will they cut our fists off
[02:08:46.600 --> 02:08:52.200]  because they could be used as weapons next will they I mean I've actually seen
[02:08:52.200 --> 02:08:57.680]  people arrested for bringing a plastic knife to put their butter I see that every
[02:08:57.680 --> 02:09:01.120]  few months there was one case with a valor Victorian it was the last day of
[02:09:01.120 --> 02:09:07.080]  school she brought a pie for her teacher for an antler school party with some of
[02:09:07.080 --> 02:09:12.800]  the kids in the class I even did that I remember my last day high school here in
[02:09:12.800 --> 02:09:17.240]  here in Austin I was in school in Dallas and moved on here being invited by one
[02:09:17.240 --> 02:09:21.400]  of the coaches who taught history class was some of his favorite students and
[02:09:21.400 --> 02:09:24.760]  and I'd never really been a teacher spent but he was nice we like talking
[02:09:24.760 --> 02:09:28.280]  about history and he invited us up there and he had he had some doughnuts and
[02:09:28.280 --> 02:09:31.440]  some and some and some you know soft drinks and we just talked about 20
[02:09:31.440 --> 02:09:35.080]  minutes and he said good luck in college and everything and that was the end of
[02:09:35.080 --> 02:09:40.920]  it well if I guess if he brings a plastic you know Dixie knife to spread
[02:09:40.920 --> 02:09:45.400]  butter on a bagel you get arrested and in the case of that valor Victorian they
[02:09:45.400 --> 02:09:51.040]  took her degree made her go back another year of school that was in the news a
[02:09:51.040 --> 02:09:55.600]  few years ago and I've seen cases of seniors they want to get you before you
[02:09:55.600 --> 02:10:00.320]  get out of there where in one case it's always a high graded student in the
[02:10:00.320 --> 02:10:04.480]  other case it was a salutatorian was a girl again her mother had bought her
[02:10:04.480 --> 02:10:09.440]  because she was moving out that weekend to go to college early and it was in her
[02:10:09.440 --> 02:10:18.040]  truck they saw it a plastic box with the metal you know spoons steak knives in the
[02:10:18.040 --> 02:10:29.440]  package they arrested her and they said sorry is zero tolerance you've got a
[02:10:29.440 --> 02:10:34.320]  steak knife and they're like but it's a package of spoons and forks and butter
[02:10:34.320 --> 02:10:37.320]  knives and a few steak knives you know we bought it at Walmart they said we
[02:10:37.320 --> 02:10:42.160]  don't care you're going to jail because a security guard walking through oh I
[02:10:42.160 --> 02:10:46.920]  found something not oh that's a box a sealed box of knives forks and spoons
[02:10:46.920 --> 02:10:51.440]  it's the same obsession with government and minions of government doing
[02:10:51.440 --> 02:10:55.320]  exactly what they're told and throwing the book at citizens but then when
[02:10:55.320 --> 02:10:57.800]  bankers still trillions and tell Congress they won't say where it is
[02:10:57.800 --> 02:11:04.920]  nothing happens or oh we don't want people protesting the body scanners we
[02:11:04.920 --> 02:11:07.960]  don't want to give them a fight we want to retreat we'll just do no body
[02:11:07.960 --> 02:11:12.400]  scanning or no pat downs the day before Thanksgiving and now that's confirmed
[02:11:12.400 --> 02:11:16.260]  on Wednesday we were saying we're getting these reports and then by
[02:11:16.260 --> 02:11:20.600]  Thanksgiving Day it was all over mainstream news that they had suspended
[02:11:20.600 --> 02:11:25.400]  the pat downs and the body scans if terrorists are just everywhere why
[02:11:25.400 --> 02:11:31.520]  suspended nationwide it's an act of submission an act of domination setting
[02:11:31.520 --> 02:11:35.600]  the precedent for minimum wage federal goons to stick their hands down your
[02:11:35.600 --> 02:11:42.040]  pants it's always more more more more and I've seen news articles mainstream
[02:11:42.040 --> 02:11:47.040]  going well some joke that it may be a cavity search next but terrorists are
[02:11:47.040 --> 02:11:52.000]  talking about putting a bomb up their rear end we better pull people out and
[02:11:52.000 --> 02:11:57.040]  stick our hands up their behinds and I'm sorry to have to talk about this but
[02:11:57.040 --> 02:12:00.320]  this is what they're getting ready to do I don't want to talk for a month about
[02:12:00.320 --> 02:12:05.120]  them sticking their hands down our pants but if we don't do it if we don't talk
[02:12:05.120 --> 02:12:11.200]  about it and say no it's gonna be more more more more more more and in Matt
[02:12:11.200 --> 02:12:15.820]  Ryan's article he points out the countless cases of kids will bring a gi
[02:12:15.820 --> 02:12:23.160]  Joe figure with a two centimeter pistol kicked out of school arrested in some of
[02:12:23.160 --> 02:12:29.000]  the cases I mean you've all seen him in the news or in art class they continue
[02:12:29.000 --> 02:12:33.840]  all over the country to suspend or arrest or expel it runs the gamut they'll
[02:12:33.840 --> 02:12:41.320]  say draw a image of your parents you'll draw a portrait of them and so a kid this
[02:12:41.320 --> 02:12:46.280]  is even in like third fourth fifth grade I've seen these cases we'll draw a photo
[02:12:46.280 --> 02:12:52.760]  a picture of their dad a policeman with a gun boom when they're in elementary
[02:12:52.760 --> 02:12:57.200]  they get suspended and get in trouble and they demand psychological evaluation
[02:12:57.200 --> 02:13:03.480]  they've had art students who were 16 17 years old who get arrested one case the
[02:13:03.480 --> 02:13:08.880]  kid drew a painting of his dad who's in the Marines with an m16 folks they're
[02:13:08.880 --> 02:13:14.440]  training you that the image of a gun is a crime when citizens have it or when
[02:13:14.440 --> 02:13:18.880]  slaves have it but when a SWAT team has it when they're at a checkpoint we're
[02:13:18.880 --> 02:13:23.160]  taught it's to keep us safe oh the government in black uniforms with guns
[02:13:23.160 --> 02:13:33.000]  that's good oh citizens with guns that's bad oh you brought a plastic knife in
[02:13:33.000 --> 02:13:36.120]  fact in one of the cases the one with the valedictorian that's probably six
[02:13:36.120 --> 02:13:40.080]  seven years ago I saw that report it made national attention you probably
[02:13:40.080 --> 02:13:47.880]  remember you can pull it up they the security guard was just going class to
[02:13:47.880 --> 02:13:51.920]  class because the school they was over and they were in the security guard walked
[02:13:51.920 --> 02:13:55.920]  in where they had the pie or the cake or whatever it was and literally just went
[02:13:55.920 --> 02:14:02.960]  completely ape oh my god there is a plastic butter knife so are we gonna
[02:14:02.960 --> 02:14:07.320]  ban fist next are we gonna ban glass bottles you could break those and use it

[02:16:16.960 --> 02:16:22.360]  countless reports about English students in public school writing a story it's
[02:16:22.360 --> 02:16:25.040]  almost always about zombies because there's literally hundreds of movies and
[02:16:25.040 --> 02:16:30.120]  TV shows about zombies and vampires it's very popular and I saw several cases
[02:16:30.120 --> 02:16:34.520]  in just the last few years of people being arrested for writing fiction
[02:16:34.520 --> 02:16:39.880]  stories about zombies attacking a fictitious high school and I've told
[02:16:39.880 --> 02:16:49.600]  the story I remember in sixth grade being in English class and writing a
[02:16:49.600 --> 02:16:55.760]  story about zombies and how me and my buddy were in a pickup truck we didn't
[02:16:55.760 --> 02:17:00.520]  have cars yet we were imagining it driving in front of the school shooting
[02:17:00.520 --> 02:17:07.160]  zombies I was given an a plus for it I remember because in sixth grade folks I
[02:17:07.160 --> 02:17:11.880]  was not a good student and a plus was rare I mean I was in high school five
[02:17:11.880 --> 02:17:15.920]  years giving an idea I was too busy chasing cheerleaders in my first year in
[02:17:15.920 --> 02:17:24.160]  high school and flunked but but but the issue is I got an a plus for this in the
[02:17:24.160 --> 02:17:40.440]  mid 1980s but give me a document cam a plus in 1980 you get jail in 2010 that
[02:17:40.440 --> 02:17:49.160]  is thought crime and that's where all of this is going and I see reports all the
[02:17:49.160 --> 02:17:55.480]  time in the US of people being arrested for racial slangs there there is no law
[02:17:55.480 --> 02:17:58.880]  against it it's it's I don't like it but if you take somebody's ride it's over
[02:17:58.880 --> 02:18:03.240]  yeah put it back up on screen they found an article 10-year-old with toy gun
[02:18:03.240 --> 02:18:07.240]  arrested fingerprinting that's in Georgia the latest case of zero
[02:18:07.240 --> 02:18:12.920]  tolerance at public schools as a 10-year-old student
[02:18:12.920 --> 02:18:19.600]  sadder and wiser oh see it's good and facing expulsion and long-term juvenile
[02:18:19.600 --> 02:18:23.840]  detention and it has his mother worried that his punishment has already been
[02:18:23.840 --> 02:18:27.400]  harsher than the offense demands see the mother's so cow that she's saying oh
[02:18:27.400 --> 02:18:31.360]  this is too harsh it's ridiculous
[02:18:31.360 --> 02:18:43.480]  he brought a toy cowboy plastic six-shooter to the school with a red
[02:18:43.480 --> 02:18:51.560]  tip they bought it at the toy store with along with the cowboy hat I mean
[02:18:51.560 --> 02:19:03.920]  ladies and gentlemen my father just 43 years ago or so took his shotgun and
[02:19:03.920 --> 02:19:09.920]  rifles to school with him but they all knew gun safety the principals all had
[02:19:09.920 --> 02:19:13.400]  guns in their offices you didn't have school shootings let me tell you in the
[02:19:13.400 --> 02:19:19.040]  1950s the early 1960s didn't matter if it was New York City or East Texas if
[02:19:19.040 --> 02:19:24.760]  some nut took a gun in the school there they're gonna be dead in minutes
[02:19:24.760 --> 02:19:30.920]  nowadays they teach the children in school drills to get on their knees and
[02:19:30.920 --> 02:19:36.160]  wait to die they don't teach them get out the window run have a teacher that's
[02:19:36.160 --> 02:19:40.960]  armed fight back wait I mean if somebody was shooting I didn't have a gun I
[02:19:40.960 --> 02:19:44.120]  couldn't get out the window they had burglar bars I would crouch down behind
[02:19:44.120 --> 02:19:48.200]  the door and when the guy open the door he wouldn't be expecting it and I would
[02:19:48.200 --> 02:19:53.600]  break his jaw and a lot of you feel like you're weak folks if somebody's coming

[02:25:12.920 --> 02:25:17.800]  Americans are willing to trample on one another to get their hands on cheap
[02:25:17.800 --> 02:25:22.720]  foreign made plastic garbage even as the United States turns into a post
[02:25:22.720 --> 02:25:27.040]  industrial wasteland from the American dream blog we have it again posted on
[02:25:27.040 --> 02:25:35.120]  prisonplanet.com in the commentary area and they point out what is evident to
[02:25:35.120 --> 02:25:40.800]  anyone that understands what's happening that Americans on average have
[02:25:40.800 --> 02:25:46.240]  turned into blobs have turned into people that see themselves as like being
[02:25:46.240 --> 02:25:52.080]  children who just follow government rules and that life is all about satiating
[02:25:52.080 --> 02:25:58.600]  our bellies our sex drive our lust for entertainment but if you study the
[02:25:58.600 --> 02:26:02.240]  different psychological indexes that have been done in the surveys people are
[02:26:02.240 --> 02:26:08.200]  more unhappy than ever if life is nothing but entertainment and sex and
[02:26:08.200 --> 02:26:21.200]  drugs and grazing you know a type of twisted hunter-gatherer modern version
[02:26:21.200 --> 02:26:28.320]  of hunting and gathering where people just go to malls and just buy things to
[02:26:28.320 --> 02:26:32.320]  buy it never seen a child who really wants a toy when they're reading a
[02:26:32.320 --> 02:26:36.080]  catalog and when you get them the toy they're excited they open it they put
[02:26:36.080 --> 02:26:44.200]  together never touch it again but then toys where they have to be creative like
[02:26:44.200 --> 02:26:51.640]  Legos or painting or erector sets they never get tired of those but the big
[02:26:51.640 --> 02:26:56.080]  fancy flashy toy they don't use it and it's the same thing with video games I'm
[02:26:56.080 --> 02:26:59.480]  not attacking people to play video games I played my fair share and you know
[02:26:59.480 --> 02:27:03.920]  junior high and high school it's just there are more important things to do
[02:27:03.920 --> 02:27:10.240]  in the real world and when we only get obsessed with false reality they have
[02:27:10.240 --> 02:27:14.120]  all these big video games these communal games where there's millions of
[02:27:14.120 --> 02:27:18.760]  people playing them at one time where people pay real money for a Ferrari they
[02:27:18.760 --> 02:27:24.720]  pay real money for a girlfriend they pay real money for a mansion in cyberspace
[02:27:24.720 --> 02:27:35.400]  and people get obsessed with it people get totally preoccupied with things that
[02:27:35.400 --> 02:27:39.360]  don't matter and while they're obsessed with the video games they're not going
[02:27:39.360 --> 02:27:44.400]  out and finding a mate they're not planning a guard in the backyard they're
[02:27:44.400 --> 02:27:49.280]  not looking at the meteor showers they're not looking at the moon they're not
[02:27:49.280 --> 02:27:53.400]  fishing they're not visiting their grandmother in the nursing home they're
[02:27:53.400 --> 02:27:59.040]  not involved in the real world they're being sucked into the corporate
[02:27:59.040 --> 02:28:05.880]  manufactured Hollywood death machine that's killing our culture to the point
[02:28:05.880 --> 02:28:10.440]  of a lot of people can't even get upset by the TSA sticking their hands down
[02:28:10.440 --> 02:28:23.440]  their pants and it's just that simple I I was talking to a psychologist
[02:28:23.440 --> 02:28:33.720]  yesterday off air and they were pointing out that people are in a trance if you
[02:28:33.720 --> 02:28:39.480]  study the brain waves of the average westerner going back over the last 50
[02:28:39.480 --> 02:28:44.200]  years the brain wave activity is much lower it's not just chemical with the
[02:28:44.200 --> 02:28:48.720]  fluoride and the GMO foods and all the rest of the poisons when you watch
[02:28:48.720 --> 02:28:57.200]  television it's not interactive it's one way and the brain stops connecting new
[02:28:57.200 --> 02:29:01.720]  synapses and the brain waves lower the same thing happens with video games
[02:29:01.720 --> 02:29:08.040]  even though it's semi interactive and the brain waves begin to lower in people
[02:29:08.040 --> 02:29:12.200]  that watch multiple hours of TV a day by the end of a say two three hour
[02:29:12.200 --> 02:29:17.280]  television session where you catch yourself in a trance and drooling your
[02:29:17.280 --> 02:29:22.000]  brain waves lower not just into a sleep mode you're literally mesmerized
[02:29:22.000 --> 02:29:29.240]  sleepwalking this is a fact you are now in a oxygen starved level that people
[02:29:29.240 --> 02:29:34.920]  rarely have in deep deep sleeps you are now in a near-death experience that's
[02:29:34.920 --> 02:29:44.560]  mainstream news so many adults now are unable to even communicate that's why
[02:29:44.560 --> 02:29:47.720]  when you talk to them and you bring up an issue it seems like they're in a
[02:29:47.720 --> 02:29:52.920]  trance they are in a trance we'll be right back we're on the March the

[02:31:11.640 --> 02:31:15.520]  wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have it's
[02:31:15.520 --> 02:31:19.520]  true total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid
[02:31:19.520 --> 02:31:24.080]  technology is coming number three in some areas of the country the power grid is
[02:31:24.080 --> 02:31:28.080]  dangerously overloaded and now new socialist legislation is only
[02:31:28.080 --> 02:31:31.880]  compounding the problem number four dangerous weather is always a threat to
[02:31:31.880 --> 02:31:35.520]  local grids every year thousands of families lose their power from weather

[02:33:35.760 --> 02:33:38.760]  and with your questions your comments on all that's happening I've got some other
[02:33:38.760 --> 02:33:45.760]  news I want to hit on as well but I saw a video embedded in this article
[02:33:45.760 --> 02:33:49.760]  Americans are willing to trample on one another to get their hands on cheap
[02:33:49.760 --> 02:33:53.760]  foreign made plastic garbage even as the United States turns into a post
[02:33:53.760 --> 02:33:59.760]  industrial wasteland and the video put out on this YouTube channel is very
[02:33:59.760 --> 02:34:05.760]  powerful it's SGT bull 07 is the channel but that's hard to remember
[02:34:05.760 --> 02:34:11.760]  that the name of the video is the madness of a lost society and I watched
[02:34:11.760 --> 02:34:14.760]  quite a few of the videos on this channel today I thought they were very
[02:34:14.760 --> 02:34:20.760]  impressive and this person really has a way with words to crystallize complex
[02:34:20.760 --> 02:34:24.760]  issues simply so I say Bravo to the director and the person that is putting
[02:34:24.760 --> 02:34:30.760]  these videos together keep up the great work let's go ahead and also want to
[02:34:30.760 --> 02:34:35.760]  make sure that we post this video by itself on info wars dot com the madness
[02:34:35.760 --> 02:34:38.760]  of a lost society so it's easy for folks to find it I know it's on prison
[02:34:38.760 --> 02:34:43.760]  planet but halfway down the page buried in an article I want to get this up
[02:34:43.760 --> 02:34:48.760]  for everybody but here is the video and the audio for radio listeners and it
[02:34:48.760 --> 02:34:52.760]  it really illustrates what's happened to our society but if you are just a
[02:34:52.760 --> 02:34:56.760]  radio listener not a prison planet dot TV viewer I suggest you do go to
[02:34:56.760 --> 02:35:00.760]  prison planet dot com link through to this video and watch it because seeing
[02:35:00.760 --> 02:35:06.760]  people rioting and climbing over each other to get cheap Chinese slave goods
[02:35:06.760 --> 02:35:11.760]  they should be getting physically involved in the streets taking our
[02:35:11.760 --> 02:35:17.760]  country back and he also makes the point of if this country goes the way of
[02:35:17.760 --> 02:35:21.760]  Argentina and that's where we're headed can you imagine how these folks are
[02:35:21.760 --> 02:35:25.760]  going to burn down every major US city demanding their welfare checks here's
[02:35:25.760 --> 02:35:32.760]  the video in the audio the madness of a lost society November 26 2010
[02:35:32.760 --> 02:35:37.760]  black Friday revealed yet further evidence of the complete madness of the
[02:35:37.760 --> 02:35:42.760]  populace of our lost society kids didn't hear the leaders of China and Russia
[02:35:42.760 --> 02:35:46.760]  China and Russia said that they are renouncing the dollar the best way to
[02:35:46.760 --> 02:35:50.760]  think of it is a ticking time bomb at some stage the dollar will fall sharply
[02:35:50.760 --> 02:35:54.760]  now you might be saying meal what the heck does this mean to me as the dollar
[02:35:54.760 --> 02:35:59.760]  loses status as the world's reserve currency as mystery missiles launch just
[02:35:59.760 --> 02:36:03.760]  off our shores as north and south Korea take the world to the brink of war as
[02:36:03.760 --> 02:36:08.760]  the TSA violates all measure of liberty and constitutional rights and as the
[02:36:08.760 --> 02:36:12.760]  US military itself prepares for the coming total economic collapse and
[02:36:12.760 --> 02:36:18.760]  breakdown of civil order this is what Americans care about wanton lustful
[02:36:18.760 --> 02:36:22.760]  commercialism acting like animals fighting over trinkets made by human
[02:36:22.760 --> 02:36:27.760]  beings for slave wages as you watch this horrific video do you think any of
[02:36:27.760 --> 02:36:31.760]  these people on a single ounce of physical precious metal any gold any
[02:36:31.760 --> 02:36:35.760]  silver do you think that even one of them understands what the Federal Reserve
[02:36:35.760 --> 02:36:40.760]  is or that the Fed is spending them into oblivion and economic slavery do you
[02:36:40.760 --> 02:36:44.760]  think even one among them has made any preparations at all for the day when
[02:36:44.760 --> 02:36:47.760]  there is no food on grocery store shelves and do you think the morally
[02:36:47.760 --> 02:36:52.760]  bankrupt executives at Target or Wal-Mart even care this is what we become
[02:36:52.760 --> 02:36:56.760]  a decadent mindless culture who by virtue of this complete and willful
[02:36:56.760 --> 02:37:00.760]  ignorance are now officially complicit in the crimes being perpetrated against
[02:37:00.760 --> 02:37:04.760]  us do you think these people who behave like animals who's literally trampling
[02:37:04.760 --> 02:37:08.760]  each other over one hundred ninety eight dollar laptops and ten dollar toasters
[02:37:08.760 --> 02:37:12.760]  will even pause for a moment to consider their actions before they ride and burn
[02:37:12.760 --> 02:37:16.760]  entire cities when the days of hyperinflation finally arrive when the
[02:37:16.760 --> 02:37:21.760]  grocery stores are bare when they are truly desperate this my friends is
[02:37:21.760 --> 02:37:25.760]  what a dumb down morally bankrupt completely broken society looks like
[02:37:25.760 --> 02:37:30.760]  and this is how it behaves no outrage over the bankers raping them no
[02:37:30.760 --> 02:37:35.760]  outrage over their gutted industry no outrage over their plunder dollar just
[02:37:35.760 --> 02:37:42.760]  blind wanton stupidity just bread and circuses the elite are social Darwinists
[02:37:42.760 --> 02:37:46.760]  and they believe what they can get away with is fair game as long as we allow it
[02:37:46.760 --> 02:37:51.760]  this is social engineering and they've done it to us by design they've turned
[02:37:51.760 --> 02:37:55.760]  us into animals that they can corral we are no longer citizens in a republic
[02:37:55.760 --> 02:38:00.760]  safeguarded by our elected representatives we are consumers feeding at a corporate
[02:38:00.760 --> 02:38:06.760]  trough managed by officials will you tell the American people to whom you
[02:38:06.760 --> 02:38:12.760]  lent 2.2 trillion of their dollars hundreds and hundreds of banks any bank
[02:38:12.760 --> 02:38:17.760]  or that has access to the U.S. Federal Reserve system tell us who they are
[02:38:17.760 --> 02:38:23.760]  no if this is America who will stop them our entire system is corrupt and needs
[02:38:23.760 --> 02:38:27.760]  to be dismantled and begun anew but from what base if what happened on Friday
[02:38:27.760 --> 02:38:32.760]  across America is any indication of the condition of the American populace then
[02:38:32.760 --> 02:38:36.760]  our very foundations are built of sand may God forgive us for what we've
[02:38:36.760 --> 02:38:40.760]  become and for what we've allowed to happen to our nation and may those of us
[02:38:40.760 --> 02:38:45.760]  with the courage and sense to do it renounce this behavior and the monstrous
[02:38:45.760 --> 02:38:51.760]  marketing ploy that is black Friday in its entirety this my friends is not us
[02:38:51.760 --> 02:38:59.760]  we are the republic we are the informed we are the proactive ones and it is
[02:38:59.760 --> 02:39:05.760]  our job to lift up those who are lost in saving our republic is a full-time job
[02:39:05.760 --> 02:39:15.760]  may God bless the republic thanks for watching the madness of a lost society
[02:39:15.760 --> 02:39:21.760]  well great voiceover great material great information great video selects and I
[02:39:21.760 --> 02:39:25.760]  know there are millions of people out there who can even top that they can
[02:39:25.760 --> 02:39:29.760]  top what I'm doing recently one of the biggest newspapers magazines in the
[02:39:29.760 --> 02:39:35.760]  country was here for a big cover story they're doing in February and they
[02:39:35.760 --> 02:39:41.760]  asked where I want to go in the future I I want to be able to see so many other
[02:39:41.760 --> 02:39:49.760]  people more articulate more focused more skilled than I out there fighting the
[02:39:49.760 --> 02:39:55.760]  globalist that I can literally quit and shut all this down that's my goal I
[02:39:55.760 --> 02:40:00.760]  don't want to be doing this it is invigorating it is empowering it's also
[02:40:00.760 --> 02:40:09.760]  exhausting and if there were 10 20 other people who were as well-spoken focused
[02:40:09.760 --> 02:40:16.760]  dedicated and who weren't in fighting with each other I would quit I'd be gone
[02:40:16.760 --> 02:40:26.760]  I would literally transfer my entire operation to someone better than I now
[02:40:26.760 --> 02:40:29.760]  sure that's a great video and on that channel there's a whole bunch of well
[02:40:29.760 --> 02:40:33.760]  done videos and that's that individual obviously probably in their part time
[02:40:33.760 --> 02:40:37.760]  they've got to work whatever their profession is putting that material
[02:40:37.760 --> 02:40:44.760]  together but all of you could do what they've done all of you could try to get
[02:40:44.760 --> 02:40:48.760]  to a point make a film get the funding to quit your regular job and be a full
[02:40:48.760 --> 02:40:56.760]  time info warrior you could do it and I have looked I've tried to look for
[02:40:56.760 --> 02:40:59.760]  other leaders I've tried to have other people on air and build them up I found
[02:40:59.760 --> 02:41:03.760]  people that aren't mentally ill who aren't in this to be stars but not that
[02:41:03.760 --> 02:41:07.760]  many most people that get into this fight against the new world order at a
[02:41:07.760 --> 02:41:12.760]  prominent level are ego maniacs and they're completely obsessed and jealous
[02:41:12.760 --> 02:41:17.760]  of who I am and what I do when I have a pretty low view of myself it's hard
[02:41:17.760 --> 02:41:20.760]  getting up here and talking for three hours a day and staying focused and
[02:41:20.760 --> 02:41:25.760]  being articulate I don't have teleprompters and it's scary it's one of the
[02:41:25.760 --> 02:41:30.760]  most frustrating things out there that I'm the best there is people take my
[02:41:30.760 --> 02:41:36.760]  confidence my anger my commitment my focus as ego it is not ego my ego has
[02:41:36.760 --> 02:41:42.760]  been crushed it has almost completely evaporated in really realizing what
[02:41:42.760 --> 02:41:45.760]  we're up against knowing they're poisoning our food and water knowing
[02:41:45.760 --> 02:41:49.760]  that we're going into pure tyranny I mean I'm not thinking about people
[02:41:49.760 --> 02:41:53.760]  thinking I'm cool at a restaurant or getting to hang out with Hollywood
[02:41:53.760 --> 02:41:59.760]  people I guess it's because I've done it that I realize that I don't want to
[02:41:59.760 --> 02:42:03.760]  say it's not fulfilling because a lot of people I've met are cool and enjoy
[02:42:03.760 --> 02:42:07.760]  freedom and I like them because of that but it's people that think that if they
[02:42:07.760 --> 02:42:12.760]  were rich if they were powerful if they ran in powerful circles that they would
[02:42:12.760 --> 02:42:16.760]  be fulfilled and I'm here to tell you ladies and gentlemen it is not
[02:42:16.760 --> 02:42:21.760]  fulfilling unless you're standing up for widows and orphans unless you're
[02:42:21.760 --> 02:42:25.760]  standing up for the truth unless you're standing up for human dignity I really
[02:42:25.760 --> 02:42:30.760]  am upset about the neurological disorders off the charts the diabetes off the
[02:42:30.760 --> 02:42:35.760]  charts the poisons and the vaccines I empathize when I see adults at a
[02:42:35.760 --> 02:42:40.760]  Walgreens lined up with their kids shooting them up with vaccines I actually
[02:42:40.760 --> 02:42:46.760]  say something to them I was sitting there at Thanksgiving and there was a
[02:42:46.760 --> 02:42:50.760]  bunch of family over in East Texas and I had to hear about how they had the
[02:42:50.760 --> 02:42:54.760]  vaccine pushed on them at at the at the store and so they went ahead and got
[02:42:54.760 --> 02:43:00.760]  it and I had to sit there and warn that family and you know I had to sit there
[02:43:00.760 --> 02:43:03.760]  and hear them kind of go all the government wouldn't hurt me and I had
[02:43:03.760 --> 02:43:07.760]  to say really like all the people they shot up with syphilis you know grow up
[02:43:07.760 --> 02:43:11.760]  man you think I'm sitting here telling you this for fun I've been sitting here
[02:43:11.760 --> 02:43:16.760]  for hours at Thanksgiving and haven't even talked I don't particular need to
[02:43:16.760 --> 02:43:20.760]  sit here and show off for you when somebody's warned you about something it
[02:43:20.760 --> 02:43:24.760]  doesn't mean they're trying to act like there's your stupid I'm trying to warn
[02:43:24.760 --> 02:43:28.760]  you I didn't say it like that I just said listen you better look into what's
[02:43:28.760 --> 02:43:30.760]  in those shots
[02:43:36.760 --> 02:43:40.760]  the real response would have probably been to just turn the entire table over
[02:43:40.760 --> 02:43:46.760]  and say research vaccines stop killing yourself if you saw somebody rushing out
[02:43:46.760 --> 02:43:50.760]  in front of traffic on an interstate highway and they wouldn't listen to you
[02:43:50.760 --> 02:43:53.760]  we're standing out there about to be run over wouldn't you go push them out of the
[02:43:53.760 --> 02:43:57.760]  way and if they tried to get back out in traffic you'd probably have to go ahead
[02:43:57.760 --> 02:44:02.760]  and punch them I mean you know we've got to start recognizing these attacks for
[02:44:02.760 --> 02:44:08.760]  what they are hardcore and serious man we've got to really get serious here
[02:44:08.760 --> 02:44:10.760]  this isn't a game
[02:44:12.760 --> 02:44:15.760]  and I've tried to build up so many people I've tried to have other people on the
[02:44:15.760 --> 02:44:19.760]  radio shows and their websites and in almost every case they like make stuff up
[02:44:19.760 --> 02:44:22.760]  about me and flip out and try to attack thinking if they could do something to me
[02:44:22.760 --> 02:44:27.760]  that they then be big stars and they never produce any real material or work
[02:44:27.760 --> 02:44:31.760]  and they just nitty and fight with each other and we have no future if we don't
[02:44:31.760 --> 02:44:35.760]  beat these globalist I mean the globalists are able to beat us because we are
[02:44:35.760 --> 02:44:41.760]  those slobs trampling each other at Wal-Mart and Target for crud
[02:44:41.760 --> 02:44:47.760]  let me tell you if they had a video you know with David Rockefeller admitting
[02:44:47.760 --> 02:44:51.760]  he's a eugenicist and then he wants to kill us I'd be in line for a week with a
[02:44:51.760 --> 02:44:57.760]  tent trying to get in the door to get the video to make sure it got out but I
[02:44:59.760 --> 02:45:02.760]  I mean standing there in line desperate
[02:45:04.760 --> 02:45:09.760]  I can see people standing in line ready to fight each other over land grants being
[02:45:09.760 --> 02:45:13.760]  given thousands of acres you know in the past when the federal government got
[02:45:13.760 --> 02:45:16.760]  land they said here come take it because they knew the people would make wealth on
[02:45:16.760 --> 02:45:19.760]  the land now they don't want you to have land they don't want you to have wealth
[02:45:19.760 --> 02:45:25.760]  they want you to be dependent on them they will trample and they will fight
[02:45:25.760 --> 02:45:31.760]  each other over junk that breaks as soon as they take it out of the box like
[02:45:31.760 --> 02:45:35.760]  they're finding their salvation in those stores and I'm not saying buying things
[02:45:35.760 --> 02:45:40.760]  and selling things is bad I'm saying worshipping it having it as the ultimate
[02:45:40.760 --> 02:45:44.760]  thing in your life and the not caring about the really serious things in life
[02:45:44.760 --> 02:45:50.760]  is destructive you know some woman running out and going woo I got it I got
[02:45:50.760 --> 02:45:55.760]  in front of people I got ten dollars off on the Chinese slave goods
[02:45:55.760 --> 02:46:01.760]  all right I said I'd take your calls and I'm ranting it's just a lot of people
[02:46:01.760 --> 02:46:05.760]  see the bad in humanity and they give up on humanity and they hate their fellow
[02:46:05.760 --> 02:46:11.760]  man and the elite see us as fat stupid dumb people and they want to kill us and
[02:46:11.760 --> 02:46:15.760]  I want to build people up I want to reach out to folks just because other people
[02:46:15.760 --> 02:46:19.760]  are cruddy and bad doesn't mean that I'm going to be cruddy and bad I want to try
[02:46:19.760 --> 02:46:26.760]  to lift people up I don't want to give up on our species this is coming down to
[02:46:26.760 --> 02:46:34.760]  the wire now we're coming down to the wire now on this and stuff's gonna get real
[02:46:34.760 --> 02:46:37.760]  bad real quick you've already seen what's happened exactly as we said we've
[02:46:37.760 --> 02:46:44.760]  studied history we've studied the globalist and I just want to stop it
[02:46:44.760 --> 02:46:48.760]  but even if we don't stop it at least we're gonna have hundreds of millions
[02:46:48.760 --> 02:46:52.760]  of people worldwide tens of millions in the United States who really know the
[02:46:52.760 --> 02:46:57.760]  score we've got a chance to then beat the globalist once no one can deny what's
[02:46:57.760 --> 02:47:02.760]  happening and we'll have a brain trust to rebuild the Republic and a free
[02:47:02.760 --> 02:47:09.760]  society we know if we give in it's over and we know the globalists are using
[02:47:09.760 --> 02:47:14.760]  this giant mob of dumb down fluoride heads as a political weapon against those
[02:47:14.760 --> 02:47:19.760]  of us that are awake and decent so you've got to reach out to the blobs even
[02:47:19.760 --> 02:47:23.760]  if they're disgusting and ignorant and giggle at you like a like a mentally
[02:47:23.760 --> 02:47:27.760]  old child and love their slavery you've still got to warn them because some of
[02:47:27.760 --> 02:47:33.760]  them can be woken up because they're dangerous hog goblins you just saw the
[02:47:33.760 --> 02:47:38.760]  video let's go ahead and talk to Milton in New York Milton thanks for holding
[02:47:38.760 --> 02:47:46.760]  her on the air worldwide hello Alex I was wondering in regard to the
[02:47:46.760 --> 02:47:51.760]  control and crackdown on the internet I was wondering what is your take on the
[02:47:51.760 --> 02:48:02.760]  IRS 605 o w that applies to literally all internet commerce now yeah I know
[02:48:02.760 --> 02:48:05.760]  they're wanting everybody to have to create a record of it and give it to
[02:48:05.760 --> 02:48:09.760]  the government and anything over $600 you've got to get a which will just shut
[02:48:09.760 --> 02:48:14.760]  down commerce you've got to give them a tax form to track it and it's it's
[02:48:14.760 --> 02:48:19.760]  it's it's just more more more more more and it'll just shut down our economy
[02:48:19.760 --> 02:48:24.760]  that much faster I think it's horrible under right six oh five oh w what
[02:48:24.760 --> 02:48:31.760]  what it is also is that online sellers if they sell a twenty thousand
[02:48:31.760 --> 02:48:38.760]  dollars or more or run 200 transactions are subject to 1099 starting
[02:48:38.760 --> 02:48:42.760]  January 2011 yeah that's what I was talking about and and they've got in
[02:48:42.760 --> 02:48:46.760]  the health care bill a whole bunch of stuff tracking everything I mean listen
[02:48:46.760 --> 02:48:50.760]  they're announcing the austerity we're about a year behind Europe the pension
[02:48:50.760 --> 02:48:54.760]  funds the veterans health care there they're coming for everything and they've
[02:48:54.760 --> 02:48:58.760]  got fake conservatives on the news going yeah we got to cut the government but
[02:48:58.760 --> 02:49:03.760]  they're only cutting areas of the budget not of the thousand five hundred
[02:49:03.760 --> 02:49:09.760]  trillion plus in derivatives that's 99 plus percent of the problem all the other
[02:49:09.760 --> 02:49:16.760]  stuff is window dressing what do you think about all this I think the IRS is
[02:49:16.760 --> 02:49:22.760]  undergoing a major crackdown and they're doing everything they can to plug up
[02:49:22.760 --> 02:49:27.760]  every hole that they possibly can in fact they even heard was it rushed
[02:49:27.760 --> 02:49:34.760]  yesterday talking about new regulate IRS regulations on tax preparers yeah
[02:49:34.760 --> 02:49:38.760]  they already did that five years ago now they're accelerating it where the tax
[02:49:38.760 --> 02:49:45.760]  preparers will not sign off on mainline tax write-offs and then now CPA's job is
[02:49:45.760 --> 02:49:49.760]  just to give all your money more than you even owe under the fraudulent system
[02:49:49.760 --> 02:49:54.760]  the Federal Reserve give it all to them yes it's just a total raping but then
[02:49:54.760 --> 02:50:00.760]  they write the rules where Google and Microsoft pay 2.4 percent tax but then
[02:50:00.760 --> 02:50:05.760]  you you know who owns a car dealership or restaurant when they're done with you
[02:50:05.760 --> 02:50:10.760]  they've gotten rid of most the write-offs the average person's paying about 40%
[02:50:10.760 --> 02:50:15.760]  and I think that this is a direct frontal assault on the middle class in
[02:50:15.760 --> 02:50:19.760]  particular oh absolutely and then they've got all these shows on ABC with
[02:50:19.760 --> 02:50:23.760]  Bill Gates saying raised taxes on rich he's not that's not the billionaires
[02:50:23.760 --> 02:50:28.760]  that's the guy down the street that's got 20 employees and because they want him
[02:50:28.760 --> 02:50:34.760]  out of there they want a wasteland this is economic warfare they admit it
[02:50:34.760 --> 02:50:40.760]  oh boy thank you Milton thank you Milton we're out of time there I'm gonna talk
[02:50:40.760 --> 02:50:44.760]  to Bill al-Qaeda Bobby Pedro we'll try to jam you all in on the other side of your

[02:51:30.760 --> 02:51:34.760]  stealth for centuries to establish an oppressive world government I believe
[02:51:34.760 --> 02:51:38.760]  first of all that we now need nothing short of a world constitution for the
[02:51:38.760 --> 02:51:42.760]  global financial system global governance with the establishment of the G20

[02:54:39.760 --> 02:54:46.760]  for I sent an email to Aaron I wanted you to take a peek at the senate
[02:54:46.760 --> 02:54:52.760]  payoffs or campaign contributions the list that I forwarded to you it's
[02:54:52.760 --> 02:54:58.760]  from a florida address it's quite amazing what poured into the senate
[02:54:58.760 --> 02:55:07.760]  for this s 510 up until the 20th of November let me guess it's a it's
[02:55:07.760 --> 02:55:13.760]  it's big agribusiness to the tune of about 12 million dollars that was just
[02:55:13.760 --> 02:55:18.760]  up until the 20th of November now did you mail that or email it I emailed it
[02:55:18.760 --> 02:55:22.760]  what was the title of your email because that's an important story I mean I've
[02:55:22.760 --> 02:55:25.760]  already seen articles months ago that big agro wrote the bill but I'd like to
[02:55:25.760 --> 02:55:29.760]  like to show folks who donated for it because the media is like this will
[02:55:29.760 --> 02:55:33.760]  get big agro that keeps poisoning you know this shuts down their competition

[02:55:58.760 --> 02:56:01.760]  really needs to get out there they slipped this under the thing there was a
[02:56:01.760 --> 02:56:06.760]  very good movie that that dealt into it not long ago with George Clooney
[02:56:06.760 --> 02:56:10.760]  Michael Clayton was the name of the movie that's excellent excellent when they
[02:56:10.760 --> 02:56:15.760]  try to kill the lawyer yeah yeah it's really about Monsanto sure that's
[02:56:15.760 --> 02:56:20.760]  exactly right and and I would say to the people that they really need to go rent
[02:56:20.760 --> 02:56:26.760]  the movie rewatch it and really see what that's about I got inspired a little
[02:56:26.760 --> 02:56:30.760]  while ago because I watched a tape of you and judge Napolitano from just a few
[02:56:30.760 --> 02:56:35.760]  days ago him talking about building seven with you and I will tell you this I
[02:56:35.760 --> 02:56:40.760]  was I was born and raised in Manhattan and a little outside of Manhattan my dad
[02:56:40.760 --> 02:56:44.760]  had a restaurant business there for about 30 years I grew up as a kid there
[02:56:44.760 --> 02:56:49.760]  my dad became an elder in a church and there was a fellow elder who was an
[02:56:49.760 --> 02:56:55.760]  engineer on the World Trade Centers and I'm going to go document this stuff and
[02:56:55.760 --> 02:57:00.760]  I'm going to forward it to you the engineer there was a big story the
[02:57:00.760 --> 02:57:04.760]  reason why the two buildings and they never covered it 9-1-1 why the two
[02:57:04.760 --> 02:57:07.760]  buildings didn't get simultaneously finished they were supposed to be
[02:57:07.760 --> 02:57:12.760]  finished at the same time there was in fact a huge a very large schooner that
[02:57:12.760 --> 02:57:16.760]  was discovered kind of like the little blurb that they showed today when they
[02:57:16.760 --> 02:57:21.760]  were re-excavating but this the New York Port Authority shut down the site
[02:57:21.760 --> 02:57:24.760]  because of the value of it and they literally pulled up an entire schooner
[02:57:24.760 --> 02:57:28.760]  with a three-masted schooner well listen we're out of time write a story about
[02:57:28.760 --> 02:57:32.760]  it send us an article we'll post it I want to jam in one more I'm sorry to Bobby
