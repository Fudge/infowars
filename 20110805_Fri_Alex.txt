[00:00:05.231 --> 00:00:06.551]  Big Brother.
[00:00:06.551 --> 00:00:08.312]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:08.312 --> 00:00:10.072]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:10.072 --> 00:00:11.653]  You want answers?
[00:00:11.653 --> 00:00:13.193]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:13.193 --> 00:00:17.394]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.394 --> 00:00:21.476]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:37.737 --> 00:00:39.068]  Oh, yeah!
[00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:45.962]  All right, my friends, thank you so much for joining us.
[00:00:45.962 --> 00:01:06.051]  It is Friday, the fifth day of August, 2011, and we're going to be live here for the next three hours, and we're going to have absolutely open phones to respond to the Super Congress, the debt ceiling increase, the plunging stock market yesterday, losing 512 points.
[00:01:06.051 --> 00:01:09.373]  It rebounded a little bit this morning, but is now set back in.
[00:01:10.313 --> 00:01:16.018]  To its fall stock slump amid global jitters.
[00:01:16.018 --> 00:01:19.541]  We have those reports here that we're going to be going over.
[00:01:19.541 --> 00:01:26.847]  It's down well over 100 points on the Dow Jones Industrial Average right now.
[00:01:26.847 --> 00:01:30.249]  In fact, I'll give you those exact numbers here in a moment.
[00:01:30.249 --> 00:01:30.990]  It's now down.
[00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:32.871]  The plunge is happening even faster.
[00:01:32.871 --> 00:01:34.092]  208 points.
[00:01:34.092 --> 00:01:34.132]  So,
[00:01:40.515 --> 00:01:46.017]  Not good news here, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:01:47.532 --> 00:01:50.793]  And there's also a report here.
[00:01:50.793 --> 00:01:56.034]  Dow likely to drop to 10,600, the charts are showing.
[00:01:56.034 --> 00:02:01.375]  The rough ride for equities may not be over, according to the charts, after losing 500 points Thursday.
[00:02:01.375 --> 00:02:11.058]  The Dow could drop another 700 points before finding some support, Daryl Gumpy, CEO of Gumpy Traders, told CNBC this morning.
[00:02:11.058 --> 00:02:11.778]  Mark Fobber,
[00:02:12.638 --> 00:02:23.730]  He's been very accurate in his predictions, is predicting that this basically will go into a collapse, at least in Europe.
[00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:30.176]  And he is also predicting, in fact I believe I printed that article, but I don't see it here.
[00:02:30.176 --> 00:02:34.100]  He is also predicting that they will start a war.
[00:02:35.037 --> 00:02:35.637]  I don't think so.
[00:02:50.988 --> 00:02:57.032]  Because if there's a war going on, it's okay if the government basically absolutely rapes and robs us in some people's minds.
[00:02:57.032 --> 00:03:01.155]  Russian envoy says NATO is planning attacks on Syria and Iran.
[00:03:01.155 --> 00:03:17.347]  We told you this, I don't know, over a month and a half ago from our Forehead sources and others, and we had countless callers here to the show who are current military confirming, also contractors confirming, that that is the case, that either Qaddafi leaves
[00:03:18.348 --> 00:03:24.037]  Or that late September, early October, the full ground invasion with regular army.
[00:03:25.483 --> 00:03:54.634]  Made up of the first Cav and others will begin and obviously that is a big big deal Upwards of 200 million firearms and RPGs have been handed out in the last four or five months by Gaddafi to the population of Western Libya and large portions of them are intending to fight and that will be particularly nasty and will kill a lot of civilians and also NATO troops, which you know will be predominantly Predominantly
[00:03:57.077 --> 00:03:57.657]  U.S.
[00:03:57.657 --> 00:04:00.999]  forces show very serious times here.
[00:04:00.999 --> 00:04:07.802]  In every case when there's big global meltdowns, governments will launch new wars or stage terror attacks, or both.
[00:04:07.802 --> 00:04:13.945]  And we've been seeing a rebranding now that the Tea Party are the terrorists and work with Al-Qaeda.
[00:04:14.825 --> 00:04:14.985]  I think?
[00:04:32.461 --> 00:04:36.322]  Implying that I'm pushing for violence, which everybody knows is the complete opposite.
[00:04:36.322 --> 00:04:39.963]  But what do you expect from George Soros?
[00:04:39.963 --> 00:04:41.784]  So that is coming up as well.
[00:04:41.784 --> 00:04:45.685]  Two-year treasury yields drop a record low.
[00:04:45.685 --> 00:04:46.545]  Race to cash.
[00:04:46.545 --> 00:04:50.506]  Banks impose fee on rapidly growing deposits.
[00:04:50.506 --> 00:04:56.568]  We've also got all sorts of racial tension, where groups of black people are confirmed beating up groups of whites for no reason.
[00:04:56.568 --> 00:04:57.448]  We'll be right back.
[00:04:57.448 --> 00:04:57.848]  Stay with us.
[00:05:02.503 --> 00:05:06.464]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about the Silver Lungs Generator.
[00:05:06.464 --> 00:05:15.325]  Now you can produce pure and endless colloidal silver and deliver the solution directly into the bloodstream by breathing the solution through the lungs.
[00:05:15.325 --> 00:05:19.966]  The respiratory system is the first line of defense for airborne pathogens and viruses.
[00:05:19.966 --> 00:05:30.788]  The Silver Lungs Generator infuses the respiratory system with your self-produced nano-silver solutions and also delivers the silver nanoparticles instantly into the bloodstream.
[00:05:31.408 --> 00:05:40.930]  With continued legislation threatening the sale of nano silver products, you can now produce pure and endless colloidal silver with the Silver Lungs Generator.
[00:05:40.930 --> 00:05:46.352]  Very easy to follow step-by-step instructions are provided, making production fast and simple.
[00:05:46.352 --> 00:05:53.853]  Go to www.SilverLungs.com today and learn more about the breakthrough technology of the Silver Lungs Generator.
[00:05:53.853 --> 00:05:56.254]  That's www.SilverLungs.com.
[00:06:00.547 --> 00:06:01.728]  A very wealthy U.S.
[00:06:01.728 --> 00:06:08.650]  citizen is predicting that in 2011 we will witness the most important day in America in more than 50 years.
[00:06:08.650 --> 00:06:11.191]  He says it will change everything about our lives.
[00:06:11.191 --> 00:06:16.573]  The way you shop, travel, invest, educate your children, and even how you take care of your health and your own family.
[00:06:16.573 --> 00:06:19.614]  Now this man has made some outrageous predictions over the years.
[00:06:19.614 --> 00:06:20.955]  The crazy part is he's
[00:06:21.015 --> 00:06:21.936]  That's usually right.
[00:06:21.936 --> 00:06:28.180]  You see, he predicted the collapse of GM, Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and America's biggest mall owner, General Growth Properties.
[00:06:28.180 --> 00:06:31.562]  In fact, Barron's called his work a dire prophecy.
[00:06:31.562 --> 00:06:37.346]  Recently, he created a video, which you can watch online for free, detailing his biggest and most important prediction yet.
[00:06:37.346 --> 00:06:38.987]  And it's a real eye-opener.
[00:06:38.987 --> 00:06:40.288]  I can't stress this enough.
[00:06:40.288 --> 00:06:42.970]  You should at least watch this free video online today.
[00:06:42.970 --> 00:06:47.193]  He explains everything you need to know, including simple steps you can take to protect yourself.
[00:06:47.193 --> 00:06:49.755]  You can find the video at www dot
[00:06:49.975 --> 00:06:51.796]  End of America 3.com.
[00:06:51.796 --> 00:06:54.378]  That's End of America, the number 3.com.
[00:06:54.378 --> 00:06:58.261]  Watch the free video at www.EndOfAmerica3.com.
[00:06:58.261 --> 00:07:00.583]  That's EndOfAmerica3.com.
[00:07:00.583 --> 00:07:03.945]  Congratulations to our friends at eFoodsDirect.com.
[00:07:03.945 --> 00:07:05.306]  In August, they celebrate 30
[00:07:05.486 --> 00:07:05.726]  I think so.
[00:07:27.160 --> 00:07:27.641]  I'm good.
[00:07:51.843 --> 00:07:54.065]  Call 800-409-5633.
[00:07:54.065 --> 00:08:01.149]  That's 800-409-5633 or efoodsdirect.com forward slash Alex.
[00:08:01.149 --> 00:08:03.891]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[00:08:03.891 --> 00:08:13.157]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:13.157 --> 00:08:16.299]  It is Friday, the fifth day of August 2011.
[00:08:19.451 --> 00:08:21.453]  Thank you for joining us here today.
[00:08:21.453 --> 00:08:23.455]  We're live Monday through Friday, 11 a.m.
[00:08:23.455 --> 00:08:23.915]  to 2 p.m.
[00:08:23.915 --> 00:08:24.255]  Central.
[00:08:24.255 --> 00:08:26.057]  That's 12 noon to 3 p.m.
[00:08:26.057 --> 00:08:27.298]  Eastern.
[00:08:27.298 --> 00:08:31.182]  And of course, I come back live Sundays, 4 to 6 p.m.
[00:08:31.182 --> 00:08:36.447]  Central, as well with the abbreviated Sunday Transmission.
[00:08:36.447 --> 00:08:42.212]  Now, for our listeners, what's happening right now is no surprise.
[00:08:42.212 --> 00:08:43.873]  And we have uncannily
[00:08:45.177 --> 00:09:01.069]  In the last five years laid out exactly what was going to happen with the economy with a wide index and spectrum of financial historians, economists, and others who study the globalist economic program.
[00:09:01.069 --> 00:09:04.631]  It is a program of destroying economies.
[00:09:04.631 --> 00:09:10.496]  At first they create a lot of free money made up out of nothing, like Clinton did getting rid of Glass-Steagall.
[00:09:11.823 --> 00:09:17.508]  People think the economy's doing well, but basically you're like someone using heroin for the first time.
[00:09:17.508 --> 00:09:24.553]  It feels great, but six months down the road, you've got to have it or you'll basically go into convulsions.
[00:09:24.553 --> 00:09:26.755]  And that's the point that they've gotten us to.
[00:09:26.755 --> 00:09:30.838]  We're being positioned into total bankruptcy.
[00:09:30.838 --> 00:09:35.062]  The Tea Party was wrong, saying we've got to not raise the debt ceiling.
[00:09:37.307 --> 00:09:40.933]  Because that will lead to total default and collapse.
[00:09:40.933 --> 00:09:45.540]  And the Democrats saying do raise the debt ceiling, they were wrong as well.
[00:09:45.540 --> 00:09:49.106]  Because that will lead to an even greater collapse down the road.
[00:09:50.219 --> 00:10:08.694]  Because it's a mathematical certainty that when you create over 1,500 trillion in derivatives and allow the banks to sell that and gain the profit from it and then have the public signed on to the losses from the fraud that it's impossible to pay and it will destroy the economy.
[00:10:08.694 --> 00:10:10.315]  You must triage it.
[00:10:10.315 --> 00:10:13.457]  You must declare it the fraud counterfeit instruments it is.
[00:10:14.338 --> 00:10:26.901]  As we warned you in 2007, 2008, I mean, I've been covering derivatives since the late 1990s with economists, but we've been sounding the alarm really hard since 2002.
[00:10:26.901 --> 00:10:33.803]  We got IMF World Bank documents that were leaked detailing how the big central banks were planning to carry this out.
[00:10:33.803 --> 00:10:34.043]  Then,
[00:10:36.775 --> 00:10:42.999]  In 2008, we pointed out the tens of trillions being stolen by the banks, too big to fail, is being kept by them.
[00:10:42.999 --> 00:10:46.361]  It's being reinvested into more derivatives to leverage.
[00:10:46.361 --> 00:10:53.965]  This will only make the depression worse and the collapse worse coming up in the next few years.
[00:10:53.965 --> 00:10:58.088]  The technical depression would become a freefall depression.
[00:10:58.088 --> 00:11:01.190]  And now here we are, three plus years later, and it's happening.
[00:11:02.048 --> 00:11:12.554]  Now, the Tea Party, the mainline Tea Party, was better than the Obama camp of the globalist control paradigm, because they were at least saying, hey, don't raise taxes.
[00:11:12.554 --> 00:11:14.875]  That will stall the economy even more.
[00:11:14.875 --> 00:11:23.480]  And the mainstream so-called dominant media, less and less dominant, ran the hoax that they just want to hold up raising the debt ceiling.
[00:11:23.480 --> 00:11:25.381]  They're just sabotaging the economy.
[00:11:26.081 --> 00:11:29.490]  Why, they're just being obstructionist.
[00:11:29.490 --> 00:11:34.542]  No, as part of that package, the White House was demanding huge tax increases.
[00:11:36.604 --> 00:11:52.209]  And so, I'm not saying the Tea Party's bad, it's just that the debate about whether to raise it or not, as Dr. Paul Craig Roberts and Webster Tarpley and Ron Paul and the Chinese government, who's heavily invested in Treasury bills, have said, there's already technically a default.
[00:11:52.209 --> 00:11:56.450]  You're already monetizing over 75% now of the new Treasury bills.
[00:11:56.450 --> 00:11:57.631]  People aren't buying them.
[00:11:58.391 --> 00:12:01.474]  The country is going into cardiac arrest.
[00:12:01.474 --> 00:12:04.276]  We've got to get rid of the Federal Reserve.
[00:12:04.276 --> 00:12:06.458]  We've got to say no to these derivatives.
[00:12:06.458 --> 00:12:11.082]  And yes, it's going to cause a depression, but one we'll get out of much quicker.
[00:12:11.082 --> 00:12:13.985]  We're never getting out of this.
[00:12:13.985 --> 00:12:17.168]  We are going to become debt slaves.
[00:12:17.168 --> 00:12:23.954]  I was seeing numbers of it's over a half a million dollars per person if we supposedly sign ourselves on, which the politicians have done.
[00:12:25.663 --> 00:12:27.284]  And some estimates even higher.
[00:12:27.284 --> 00:12:28.985]  Individually half a million bucks.
[00:12:28.985 --> 00:12:31.046]  And then it continues to grow exponentially.
[00:12:31.046 --> 00:12:37.750]  That's only paying off the interest and keeping these derivatives from totally melting down.
[00:12:37.750 --> 00:12:43.533]  They've mixed them in and tied them in and contaminated all the major financial systems.
[00:12:43.533 --> 00:12:45.775]  All the major stocks and bonds are invested in them.
[00:12:46.335 --> 00:12:58.888]  Everything is contaminated by this pathogen, by this metastasization of this derivatives fractional reserve banking scam.
[00:12:58.888 --> 00:13:06.657]  They're devaluing global currencies so fast right now that banks are announcing they're going to make you pay to keep cash in the bank.
[00:13:07.705 --> 00:13:08.705]  Now, that's an attempt.
[00:13:08.705 --> 00:13:10.766]  Of course, they could loan those out.
[00:13:10.766 --> 00:13:15.248]  For every dollar you deposit, they can leverage out $10 under the old fractional reserve banking rule.
[00:13:15.248 --> 00:13:18.129]  But see, they don't even need your money anymore.
[00:13:18.129 --> 00:13:21.410]  Because under the derivatives rules, which they haven't stopped.
[00:13:21.410 --> 00:13:26.332]  They didn't bring back Glass-Steagall three years ago, in 2008, during the controlled implosion.
[00:13:26.332 --> 00:13:27.352]  No.
[00:13:27.352 --> 00:13:32.734]  No, they have taken the bailout money and accelerated the leveraging of the derivatives.
[00:13:34.093 --> 00:13:42.915]  So I want to take your calls on this subject on the Supreme Council of 13, the Super Congress, with the President at its head.
[00:13:42.915 --> 00:13:47.596]  Ron Paul, Larry Pratt, others have said, yes, this is unconstitutional.
[00:13:47.596 --> 00:13:58.099]  A lot of newspapers are now looking at it and saying, this isn't really just a committee, because it decides on taxes, on, well, Harry Reid says the way he interprets it, the leader of the Senate, it's on everything.
[00:13:58.379 --> 00:14:04.864]  And I've read you those quotes, and I've played you the C-SPAN clip, and we'll see if that power grab works.
[00:14:04.864 --> 00:14:07.927]  I mean, you're like, well, they don't specifically say they can go after guns.
[00:14:07.927 --> 00:14:11.229]  Well, Obama specifically can't launch wars without congressional approval.
[00:14:11.229 --> 00:14:12.130]  He's doing it.
[00:14:12.130 --> 00:14:21.998]  The ATF can't go put new gun laws in place without law, but they're doing it, even though the NRA is now doing something right for once and actually suing them over this.
[00:14:21.998 --> 00:14:25.061]  We've got to grow up and stop denying this is happening.
[00:14:25.919 --> 00:14:27.922]  We've got to admit what's happened.
[00:14:27.922 --> 00:14:33.029]  We've got to admit they've gotten rid of the filibuster on these key spending and cutting bills, which are everything.
[00:14:33.029 --> 00:14:35.773]  Everything connected to spending and cuts.
[00:14:35.773 --> 00:14:37.715]  That you can't add an amendment.
[00:14:37.715 --> 00:14:42.382]  That the bills in these areas originate now from six House and six Senate members.
[00:14:43.823 --> 00:14:55.011]  And it's going to take, as Judge Andrew Napolitano has said, members of the House and Senate standing up and saying, you don't take my right to bring bills in on these issues and to add amendments and to filibuster in the Senate.
[00:14:55.011 --> 00:14:59.375]  And people are just, a lot of people are just taking this like it's no big deal.
[00:14:59.375 --> 00:15:08.882]  And they say, well, this is just fast track, kind of like what was done starting with the World Trade Organization in the mid-90s, where Congress gives up a lot of its authority to this foreign group.
[00:15:09.704 --> 00:15:25.201]  Well, just because they've been engaged in treason for a long time, just because the Federal Reserve hijacked this country 97 years ago, or almost 98 years ago, 1913, doesn't mean it's okay.
[00:15:25.201 --> 00:15:30.487]  Just because they've had unconstitutional gun control laws in place for decades doesn't mean they shouldn't be repealed.
[00:15:31.459 --> 00:15:39.664]  You know, just because they had laws saying women couldn't vote doesn't mean they shouldn't be repealed.
[00:15:39.664 --> 00:15:47.289]  Government is power-grabbing right now because the special interests that run it are going for broke.
[00:15:47.289 --> 00:15:53.212]  They've committed so many crimes, they've got to bring in a total police state and sew this thing up or they're going to lose it all.
[00:15:53.212 --> 00:15:54.253]  It is a gamble.
[00:15:54.893 --> 00:15:57.314]  It is a bold stroke they're attempting here.
[00:15:57.314 --> 00:16:18.906]  And if we are aware of their financial attack, and if we speak out and step up and point them out that they're the criminals, they will not have the moral authority and it will give good attorney generals and good grand juries and good members of the House and Senate and others and media people the moral courage and the solidarity to stand up together.
[00:16:20.899 --> 00:16:25.460]  Now I want to hit a few other news items we'll get into more detail on later in the broadcast today, but I want to just give you the number.
[00:16:25.460 --> 00:16:33.242]  I'm going to take a lot of calls today, but please have your question and comment ready, because I want to get to the next person.
[00:16:33.242 --> 00:16:33.702]  1-800-259-9231.
[00:16:33.702 --> 00:16:41.944]  Also, if your military can get in, we told you, I don't know, was it a month and a half ago we wrote the articles from our Fort Hood sources, and then we opened the phones up, and
[00:16:44.184 --> 00:17:01.409]  had other military contractors others call and say yes the word is special forces are going to be increased in july and august on the ground that's now confirmed and did happen uh... and in september early october a major ground invasion under three core and then under that uh... first cabin others
[00:17:02.611 --> 00:17:04.232]  That's just the ground force.
[00:17:04.232 --> 00:17:16.563]  And Libya is serving out upwards of 2 million fully automatic Kalashnikovs and other rifles, handguns, RPGs, and then the regular army with a lot of high-tech goodies they bought from the British, the French, and others.
[00:17:16.563 --> 00:17:23.329]  So, as one military man said on this show, Colonel Qaddafi's got a lot of nasty stuff under his hat.
[00:17:24.785 --> 00:17:28.507]  And, well, here is the Russian envoy today.
[00:17:28.507 --> 00:17:30.568]  Paul Joseph Watson has an article on it.
[00:17:30.568 --> 00:17:39.291]  It's also being reported by Debka File, which has proven very accurate in the past with a direct line right into Israeli Shin Bet and Assad.
[00:17:39.291 --> 00:17:45.074]  Russian envoy, NATO is planning attacks on Syria and Iran.
[00:17:45.074 --> 00:17:47.875]  PrisonPlanet.com, please get this out to everybody.
[00:17:47.875 --> 00:17:52.877]  Even as it finds itself embroiled in Libya, NATO is preparing to launch a military assault on Syria.
[00:17:54.992 --> 00:17:59.277]  So again, we already got the word that they're planning, and they've told the truth.
[00:17:59.277 --> 00:18:02.482]  It doesn't mean it's necessarily going to happen, but that they're going to attempt.
[00:18:04.161 --> 00:18:05.382]  to launch a ground war.
[00:18:05.382 --> 00:18:07.143]  Now, whether that's a bluff or not, we don't know.
[00:18:07.143 --> 00:18:08.143]  To make it obvious, stand down.
[00:18:08.143 --> 00:18:09.744]  They said they killed his son again.
[00:18:09.744 --> 00:18:16.427]  I don't know how many sons he's got, but they've been proven to have lied about that a couple times in the past, whether they ran to Venezuela, so I don't know the truth.
[00:18:16.427 --> 00:18:24.152]  But yes, you've seen Obama this week coming out and saying that, hey, Syria, we meant to do something here.
[00:18:24.152 --> 00:18:28.154]  If the forces were backing to attack you, if you continue to mow them down,
[00:18:28.991 --> 00:18:29.951]  But it's very hypocritical.
[00:18:29.951 --> 00:18:30.992]  I'm not defending Syria.
[00:18:30.992 --> 00:18:32.652]  I mean, it is a dictatorship.
[00:18:32.652 --> 00:18:34.313]  I don't like it.
[00:18:34.313 --> 00:18:42.756]  But Israel, just a month or so ago, in the Golan Heights, mowed down all those people, peacefully trying to walk into area that was their land before.
[00:18:42.756 --> 00:18:52.499]  So, this would be like if Mexico took part of Texas back, and then a decade later or so, Texans walked across, you know, trying to go back to their farms and were shot.
[00:18:52.499 --> 00:18:54.520]  And then the media praised it as a great move.
[00:18:55.805 --> 00:19:03.938]  My issue here is regardless of which side of this issue you are, if you're neutral or if you realize it's all divide and conquer manipulation, still there's a lot of hypocrisy here.
[00:19:05.137 --> 00:19:09.221]  Russian envoy, NATO is planning attacks on Syria and Iran.
[00:19:09.221 --> 00:19:23.394]  Even as it finds itself still enrolled in Libya, NATO is preparing to launch a military assault on Syria in order to create a beachhead for a future attack on Iran, claims Russian envoy to NATO, Dmitry Rogozin.
[00:19:23.394 --> 00:19:25.456]  And he's the highest level as it gets.
[00:19:25.456 --> 00:19:27.337]  The planning of the military campaign is well underway.
[00:19:28.274 --> 00:19:29.475]  What does Mark Faber say today?
[00:19:29.475 --> 00:19:32.257]  He says they're getting ready to launch a war because of the financial collapse.
[00:19:32.257 --> 00:19:36.559]  Again, they bring the collapse in to consolidate, but give you a war, so you'll do what you're told.
[00:19:36.559 --> 00:19:43.704]  Then they can stage terror attacks, say Qaddafi's doing it, Assad's doing it, with the Tea Party, because now they say the Tea Party works with the Muslims.
[00:19:43.704 --> 00:19:51.589]  Now, anybody that believes that, on average, a lot of Tea Party people are absolute Islamophobes, actually have, you know, Osama Bin Laden dartboards at home.
[00:19:52.269 --> 00:19:53.329]  Nevertheless, they're saying it.
[00:19:53.329 --> 00:19:55.090]  They think you'll buy it.
[00:19:55.090 --> 00:20:01.092]  We're going to come back and start taking your calls and I'll get more into this and a lot more and the economy.
[00:20:01.092 --> 00:20:04.713]  OpticsPlanet is calling all hunters, shooters, and outdoorsmen.

[00:21:30.387 --> 00:21:31.628]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[00:21:31.628 --> 00:21:36.191]  Have you ever wondered why banks, stock workers, investment advisors won't talk about gold IRAs?
[00:21:36.191 --> 00:21:42.015]  They've been available since 1986, yet the financial industry won't recognize the value of gold before your retirement.
[00:21:42.015 --> 00:21:45.657]  Gold has outperformed paper investments, yet no word about IRAs.
[00:21:45.657 --> 00:21:48.359]  If you would like to have gold for your retirement, call 800-686-2237.
[00:21:48.359 --> 00:21:53.422]  Don't get left behind by rising inflation and low returns.
[00:21:53.422 --> 00:21:53.723]  Call 800-686-2237.
[00:21:53.723 --> 00:21:55.064]  Secure your future and call 1-800-686-2237.
[00:22:00.527 --> 00:22:01.968]  Hello, I'm Alex Jones.
[00:22:01.968 --> 00:22:12.635]  Myself, my family, the InfoWars.com team want to relay to you and your families that we are intensifying our efforts against the globalists on every front.
[00:22:12.635 --> 00:22:17.098]  InfoWars.com is leading the fight against the technocrats.
[00:22:17.098 --> 00:22:19.840]  But we can't do that without your help.
[00:22:19.840 --> 00:22:30.247]  By getting the films, pumper stickers, and t-shirts at InfoWars.com, you will wake up people in your area and support our operation as we move to the next level.
[00:22:30.327 --> 00:22:31.108]  Level.
[00:22:31.108 --> 00:22:34.590]  We need your help to spread the word like never before.
[00:22:34.590 --> 00:22:40.754]  They wish to hide themselves during this tectonic battle between the forces of freedom and darkness.
[00:22:40.754 --> 00:22:50.641]  You are the response to the globalist technocrats and their program of global eugenics dehumanization and ultimate extermination.
[00:22:50.641 --> 00:22:52.122]  The war is here.
[00:22:52.122 --> 00:22:54.044]  It's an info war.
[00:22:54.044 --> 00:22:55.985]  The spirit of 1776 versus the mindset of 1984.
[00:23:00.248 --> 00:23:01.469]  You've been lied to.
[00:23:01.469 --> 00:23:06.772]  Lied to by the Wall Street propaganda machine, the government, and the talking heads in the media.
[00:23:06.772 --> 00:23:08.633]  The market is in for another crash.
[00:23:08.633 --> 00:23:14.757]  Real estate is already in a double-dip recession, and if you want to keep your hard-earned money safe, this message is for you.
[00:23:14.757 --> 00:23:20.260]  My name is Brett Kitchen, and after losing 35% of my money when the market crashed, I said enough is enough.
[00:23:20.780 --> 00:23:29.443]  I searched and discovered a way to safely grow my money, participate in potential double-digit gains, but also have my money protected when the crashes come.
[00:23:29.443 --> 00:23:32.404]  Plus, it could save you thousands in taxes.
[00:23:32.404 --> 00:23:39.527]  I want you to get a free copy of my new book, Safe Money Millionaire, where I share this powerful tool that people like Walt Disney and J.C.
[00:23:39.527 --> 00:23:41.728]  Penney used to safely grow their wealth.
[00:23:42.208 --> 00:23:44.970]  Call 1-800-675-1640 right now to get your free copy.
[00:23:44.970 --> 00:23:45.871]  Again, that's 1-800-675-1640.
[00:23:45.871 --> 00:23:48.413]  I'm giving away a limited number of copies today, so call 1-800-675-1640.
[00:24:10.413 --> 00:24:23.525]  You know, since the days of Ronald Reagan, they've admittedly had the plunge protection team that whenever the establishment wants to boost the stock market back up, the government goes in with your tax money and buys stocks.
[00:24:23.525 --> 00:24:28.971]  Now, the insiders are always aware of that.
[00:24:30.250 --> 00:24:35.975]  When they're given the knowledge beforehand, that's another way that the big boys are allowed to engage in insider trading.
[00:24:35.975 --> 00:24:43.802]  But then if Martha Stewart gets caught, not even insider trading, but quote, lying to the FBI, she goes to jail.
[00:24:43.802 --> 00:24:46.044]  People think of Martha Stewart as the elite.
[00:24:46.044 --> 00:24:48.166]  No, folks, Martha Stewart isn't the elite.
[00:24:48.166 --> 00:24:49.247]  She's a media person.
[00:24:49.887 --> 00:24:58.013]  By the way, if you go to CNBC.com, you can see the latest graph, and we'll put that up on screen for PrisonPlanet.tv viewers here in a moment.
[00:24:58.013 --> 00:24:59.935]  But it lost over 200 points.
[00:24:59.935 --> 00:25:07.660]  First it went up about 100 points this morning, then it dropped over 200, then it gained back more than 200, and it started dropping again.
[00:25:07.660 --> 00:25:08.621]  It's now 64 points, .59 down.
[00:25:08.621 --> 00:25:09.762]  NASDAQ's down 45.83.
[00:25:09.762 --> 00:25:10.022]  That's...
[00:25:17.491 --> 00:25:21.193]  1.79% or more than triple, but the Dow's down.
[00:25:21.193 --> 00:25:23.494]  The Nasdaq's really getting stomped.
[00:25:23.494 --> 00:25:24.575]  S&P is down 1.22%.
[00:25:24.575 --> 00:25:31.359]  Hit refresh on that, guys, because...
[00:25:32.321 --> 00:25:33.122]  That's weird.
[00:25:33.122 --> 00:25:35.545]  I'm getting... So it's gyrating all over the place.
[00:25:35.545 --> 00:25:38.028]  I guess it was going down and then it just peaked back up.
[00:25:38.028 --> 00:25:40.310]  So now it's only down 49.42 points.
[00:25:40.310 --> 00:25:41.752]  Boy, it's really volatile.
[00:25:41.752 --> 00:25:46.718]  Okay, let's go to your phone calls as we continue to watch all of this today.
[00:25:46.718 --> 00:25:50.903]  George and then Jack, Dave, Ken, Malcolm, and others, when you hear a call, hang up.
[00:25:51.303 --> 00:25:51.964]  You can get in.
[00:25:51.964 --> 00:25:55.389]  We'd love to hear from you.
[00:25:55.389 --> 00:25:57.051]  800-259-9231 on this live Friday edition.
[00:25:57.051 --> 00:25:59.494]  Bob Chapman is joining us coming up the third hour.
[00:25:59.494 --> 00:26:00.395]  We'll have open phones then.
[00:26:00.395 --> 00:26:02.979]  And I've got a bunch of news I haven't even gotten to yet.
[00:26:02.979 --> 00:26:04.300]  But first, your calls.
[00:26:04.300 --> 00:26:06.003]  Georgia and Pennsylvania, you're on the air.
[00:26:06.960 --> 00:26:07.921]  Thank you for all you do.
[00:26:07.921 --> 00:26:16.531]  I try to help spread your information by making a stamp, putting it on all dollar bills to find out more information at the end for wars.
[00:26:16.531 --> 00:26:18.153]  I'm going to be going to 9-11.
[00:26:18.153 --> 00:26:19.694]  Our slave leader is going to be there.
[00:26:19.694 --> 00:26:27.263]  I'm going to be protesting the Fed and I think anybody that can be in the area probably should make their concerns on the local
[00:26:28.428 --> 00:26:32.131]  Uh, things of pertinent interest known to our leaders.
[00:26:32.131 --> 00:26:39.456]  One other thing is that the other day you said something about how much debt per person the government's running up.
[00:26:39.456 --> 00:26:41.418]  Probably should be debt per taxpayer.
[00:26:41.418 --> 00:26:44.840]  There's only 100,000 people that actually file IRS forms.
[00:26:44.840 --> 00:26:46.201]  Of that, there's only about 54,000 that pay that.
[00:26:47.742 --> 00:26:48.963]  Hold on!
[00:26:48.963 --> 00:26:53.105]  You're saying there's only 100,000 people filing tax forms?
[00:26:53.105 --> 00:26:54.006]  I think you're mistaken.
[00:26:54.006 --> 00:27:00.630]  I think you're talking about... I mean, I know roughly half the population doesn't pay, quote, income taxes.
[00:27:00.630 --> 00:27:03.592]  They pay the Social Security and other taxes.
[00:27:03.592 --> 00:27:05.233]  And it depends on how you look at the debt.
[00:27:05.233 --> 00:27:08.935]  But they talk about the average household 80,000 or 400,000 or 500,000.
[00:27:08.935 --> 00:27:11.857]  I see a lot of different numbers.
[00:27:11.857 --> 00:27:15.460]  The point is, most of the debt they admit is derivatives, so we don't really owe it.
[00:27:15.460 --> 00:27:15.960]  It's not ours.
[00:27:17.572 --> 00:27:27.678]  But that, in working out the debt per taxpayer, there's 100 million people that file, there's only 50 million that actually pay taxes on that, according to the government figures.
[00:27:27.678 --> 00:27:30.039]  And so that'll work about... Oh no, you're right!
[00:27:30.039 --> 00:27:31.580]  I misheard you, I thought you said 100,000.
[00:27:31.580 --> 00:27:32.461]  Please continue.
[00:27:32.461 --> 00:27:34.782]  I did, I misquoted.
[00:27:34.782 --> 00:27:38.764]  And the other thing is that he said that Russia's trying to increase population.
[00:27:38.764 --> 00:27:43.167]  I see a lot of people around where I live that a lot of
[00:27:43.667 --> 00:27:47.352]  These girls get out of high school and they get pregnant and they've turned that into a career.
[00:27:47.352 --> 00:27:53.540]  They get big screen TVs, they get cars, they get food, they get things that I feel like I can't afford.
[00:27:53.540 --> 00:27:57.706]  And so, yeah, the government's supporting a lot of people.
[00:27:57.706 --> 00:27:59.288]  Population increase on the lower end.
[00:27:59.893 --> 00:28:01.314]  I hear you and I appreciate your call.
[00:28:01.314 --> 00:28:05.136]  I'll go to another caller in a moment, but this is some food for thought.
[00:28:05.136 --> 00:28:07.117]  We put out a document that was internal.
[00:28:07.117 --> 00:28:08.518]  It said not for distribution.
[00:28:08.518 --> 00:28:17.683]  It was sent to us by somebody inside the state police there in Texas, and it said we are mainly trying to hire only military veterans.
[00:28:17.683 --> 00:28:25.368]  And that sounds reasonable on the surface, but government is already gobbling up a large portion of the GDP.
[00:28:25.368 --> 00:28:29.190]  One way or another, more than half the population survives off a government paycheck.
[00:28:30.066 --> 00:28:34.768]  Whether it's corporate welfare, or social security, or food stamps.
[00:28:34.768 --> 00:28:38.290]  I mean, at a certain point, what about people that didn't work for the government?
[00:28:38.290 --> 00:28:39.370]  I mean, that's discrimination.
[00:28:39.370 --> 00:28:47.013]  You can't say, well, we're only going to hire black people, we're only going to hire white people, or Hispanics, or we're only going to hire Mormons, or Catholics, or Muslims.
[00:28:47.013 --> 00:28:53.176]  Well, then how do you say, and Obama says it, we need to have tax breaks to hire military?
[00:28:53.176 --> 00:28:57.918]  How about we have tax breaks for anybody that hires?
[00:28:57.918 --> 00:28:59.099]  That would get jobs going.
[00:29:00.296 --> 00:29:03.738]  But the government knows when you cut taxes, it gets the economy going.
[00:29:03.738 --> 00:29:05.299]  They know that.
[00:29:05.299 --> 00:29:12.844]  Again, Kennedy cut the highest tax bracket by 50%, the next tax bracket by 35, tax receipts doubled one year later.
[00:29:12.844 --> 00:29:16.086]  That number is public and pull it up.
[00:29:16.086 --> 00:29:16.947]  Why don't they do that?
[00:29:16.947 --> 00:29:20.149]  Because they want to control the economy.
[00:29:20.149 --> 00:29:23.211]  And so that's discrimination.
[00:29:23.211 --> 00:29:24.031]  I'm all for
[00:29:26.226 --> 00:29:27.927]  See, they sell it well.
[00:29:27.927 --> 00:29:30.908]  Get a tax incentive for a wounded vet.
[00:29:30.908 --> 00:29:32.689]  I agree with that.
[00:29:32.689 --> 00:29:35.190]  But that's how the road to hell is paved.
[00:29:35.190 --> 00:29:36.991]  Next, it's all the troops.
[00:29:36.991 --> 00:29:40.052]  Then it's, oh, government workers who are being laid off.
[00:29:40.052 --> 00:29:42.053]  Companies, you get an incentive to hire them.
[00:29:42.053 --> 00:29:43.274]  What about everybody else?
[00:29:43.274 --> 00:29:45.034]  It's discrimination.
[00:29:45.034 --> 00:29:46.575]  It's discrimination.
[00:29:46.575 --> 00:29:48.176]  We'll be right back with more of your phone calls.
[00:29:48.176 --> 00:29:48.616]  Stay with us.
[00:29:51.089 --> 00:29:55.015]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[00:29:55.015 --> 00:29:57.699]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:00.606 --> 00:30:05.169]  This is Alex Jones with 5 good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[00:30:05.169 --> 00:30:06.070]  Number 1.
[00:30:06.070 --> 00:30:09.513]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[00:30:09.513 --> 00:30:10.353]  Number 2.
[00:30:10.353 --> 00:30:15.257]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[00:30:15.257 --> 00:30:15.997]  It's true.
[00:30:15.997 --> 00:30:20.881]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[00:30:20.881 --> 00:30:21.702]  Number 3.
[00:30:21.702 --> 00:30:25.284]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[00:30:25.284 --> 00:30:28.987]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[00:30:29.187 --> 00:30:29.987]  Number 4.
[00:30:29.987 --> 00:30:32.748]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[00:30:32.748 --> 00:30:36.429]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[00:30:36.429 --> 00:30:37.209]  Number 5.
[00:30:37.209 --> 00:30:41.350]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[00:30:41.350 --> 00:30:46.412]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[00:30:46.412 --> 00:30:50.593]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[00:30:50.593 --> 00:30:52.374]  That's mysolarbackup.com.

[00:30:57.435 --> 00:30:58.236]  877-327-0365.
[00:30:58.236 --> 00:31:03.299]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones.
[00:31:03.299 --> 00:31:08.603]  I'm looking for people that have the wisdom to spot savings, opportunity, and recognize risk.
[00:31:08.603 --> 00:31:10.144]  Saving means to make money.
[00:31:10.144 --> 00:31:18.911]  The Cal Bend Pure Soap Company can save you thousands of dollars and give you good old-fashioned real soaps that are triple concentrated and twice as good as what you're using now.
[00:31:19.651 --> 00:31:27.193]  Soaps made from vegetable and coconut oils that contain no useless dyes, perfumes, deodorants, or antibacterials.
[00:31:27.193 --> 00:31:35.196]  Your risk is the hundreds of hazardous toxic detergents that give you rashes, itching sores, and deteriorating clothing called lint.
[00:31:35.196 --> 00:31:40.417]  If you want something better, if you want something you've never had before, you have to do something you've never done before.
[00:31:40.417 --> 00:31:42.578]  Getting a free catalog is easy by calling 800-340-7091.

[00:32:01.804 --> 00:32:04.306]  And you're subject to public police action.
[00:32:04.306 --> 00:32:05.567]  Tyranny is here.
[00:32:05.567 --> 00:32:09.190]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[00:32:09.190 --> 00:32:11.752]  It really says that the state is God.
[00:32:11.752 --> 00:32:17.617]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on Earth.
[00:32:17.617 --> 00:32:23.842]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps now being expanded nationwide.
[00:32:24.262 --> 00:32:30.245]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful shadow state.
[00:32:30.245 --> 00:32:34.427]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depth to which our republic has fallen.
[00:32:34.427 --> 00:32:38.709]  Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship.
[00:32:38.709 --> 00:32:44.652]  Body scanners, sound cameras, citizen spies, stage terror and cameras on every street corner.
[00:32:44.652 --> 00:32:48.214]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[00:32:48.214 --> 00:32:50.195]  The police state isn't coming.
[00:32:50.195 --> 00:32:50.615]  It's here.

[00:33:13.004 --> 00:33:16.305]  Okay, we're going back to your phone calls here in a moment.
[00:33:16.305 --> 00:33:22.368]  Coming up in other news, mob of hundreds of black youths beat white people in racial attack.
[00:33:22.368 --> 00:33:27.350]  Milwaukee Journal's Sentinel.
[00:33:27.350 --> 00:33:29.171]  Here's another report out of the Sentinel.
[00:33:29.171 --> 00:33:32.513]  Police begin probe into mob incidents at state fair.
[00:33:34.857 --> 00:33:51.048]  Here is Renton Police in Washington investigating cartoons mocking cops, city workers, and they say that they're going to arrest them and charge them with crimes for having cartoons making fun of the police.
[00:33:51.048 --> 00:33:52.328]  They say that's not allowed.
[00:33:52.328 --> 00:33:55.210]  K-O-M-O.
[00:33:55.210 --> 00:33:59.553]  TV is reporting just amazing attacks all over the country.
[00:33:59.553 --> 00:34:02.035]  You videotape cops even from your own house, they come and arrest you.
[00:34:03.947 --> 00:34:05.488]  It's total First Amendment.
[00:34:05.488 --> 00:34:09.629]  There's no perception of privacy.
[00:34:09.629 --> 00:34:12.170]  That's how the government films us in public.
[00:34:12.170 --> 00:34:15.491]  And they got prosecutors and hand-picked juries that'll send you to jail.
[00:34:15.491 --> 00:34:16.631]  I see it every week now.
[00:34:16.631 --> 00:34:19.912]  People serving hard time.
[00:34:19.912 --> 00:34:21.533]  Hard time.
[00:34:21.533 --> 00:34:22.493]  Like the rat song.
[00:34:23.194 --> 00:34:26.016]  Hard time, hard time.
[00:34:26.016 --> 00:34:28.959]  Oh yeah, only in the Soviet states of America.
[00:34:28.959 --> 00:34:34.023]  Satirical mince mocking fun at Obama pulled from bookstore.
[00:34:34.023 --> 00:34:37.947]  Government says that's not allowed, that's out of the Knoxville News Sentinel.
[00:34:37.947 --> 00:34:40.289]  A Democratic representative saw it and didn't like it.
[00:34:41.581 --> 00:34:45.722]  Yeah, that was Joe Armstrong, so it's pulled.
[00:34:45.722 --> 00:34:55.384]  You don't talk bad about our king, the gracious supreme excellency, his highness, Obama the banker puppet.
[00:34:55.384 --> 00:34:59.926]  So that's just some of the news I've got on that front.
[00:34:59.926 --> 00:35:01.006]  Whoa!
[00:35:01.006 --> 00:35:03.787]  Hey, in court site, you want to speak in citizen communication?
[00:35:03.787 --> 00:35:05.287]  I'll just have you arrested.
[00:35:05.287 --> 00:35:06.047]  You don't like that?
[00:35:06.047 --> 00:35:08.208]  Well, we'll just fire the mayor.
[00:35:08.208 --> 00:35:08.988]  We rule!
[00:35:10.245 --> 00:35:14.648]  State Attorney General saying what they're doing is illegal, but hadn't done anything yet.
[00:35:14.648 --> 00:35:16.549]  They're in Arizona.
[00:35:16.549 --> 00:35:22.472]  Because, well, if we start going after governments that are doing things that are illegal, we're going to have to go after ourselves, huh?
[00:35:22.472 --> 00:35:23.873]  So that's the problem with corruption.
[00:35:23.873 --> 00:35:25.074]  It doesn't just stay in one spot.
[00:35:25.074 --> 00:35:29.476]  It doesn't just sit in one spot.
[00:35:29.476 --> 00:35:31.698]  You either fight it and you push it back, or it gets worse.
[00:35:31.698 --> 00:35:33.459]  It doesn't sit in one spot.
[00:35:34.454 --> 00:35:40.117]  And so see the corrupt all across this country are people in a lot of cases that aren't even mentally corrupt.
[00:35:40.117 --> 00:35:44.338]  They believe that might is right and that's their power to do this.
[00:35:44.338 --> 00:35:46.439]  The road to hell is paved with good intentions as they say.
[00:35:46.439 --> 00:35:48.280]  And the social engineers know that.
[00:35:48.280 --> 00:35:52.822]  So they they give people false mental roadmaps of why they're doing what they're doing.
[00:35:52.822 --> 00:35:57.744]  And then pretty soon nobody can report on each other's corruption because you are corrupt.
[00:35:57.744 --> 00:35:59.145]  You've done something corrupt.
[00:35:59.145 --> 00:36:02.626]  And so now the other people around you get more and more corrupt.
[00:36:02.626 --> 00:36:03.727]  And then the very
[00:36:05.367 --> 00:36:09.309]  Most corrupt people, it's like a race or something.
[00:36:09.309 --> 00:36:16.672]  They get in bigger and bigger positions of power and then everything goes to you know what in a handbasket.
[00:36:16.672 --> 00:36:17.592]  That's how it works.
[00:36:17.592 --> 00:36:21.013]  That's why we know it's going to get more and more insane.
[00:36:21.013 --> 00:36:24.035]  Just like we've been telling you the last few years and it has gotten that way.
[00:36:24.035 --> 00:36:27.356]  This is the way almost all countries go.
[00:36:27.356 --> 00:36:28.796]  This is normal.
[00:36:28.796 --> 00:36:32.398]  This is the vast majority of cases.
[00:36:33.138 --> 00:36:49.790]  And at the minute that Americans can hear this show and don't think this guy's radical, the minute you study history and really look at what we're saying and go, wow, this guy actually is even saying how bad it is, the minute we stop being naive, that's when the tide turns.
[00:36:49.790 --> 00:36:52.312]  The minute you realize it's illegitimate.
[00:36:52.312 --> 00:36:54.394]  Got a famous rapper on yesterday.
[00:36:55.600 --> 00:36:55.740]  Yes.
[00:37:11.818 --> 00:37:13.119]  He has a gun.
[00:37:13.119 --> 00:37:14.439]  Can't have a gun in New York.
[00:37:14.439 --> 00:37:15.740]  They arrest him.
[00:37:15.740 --> 00:37:17.460]  He serves a couple years in jail for it.
[00:37:17.460 --> 00:37:18.741]  And I said, you know, that was wrong.
[00:37:18.741 --> 00:37:20.782]  And he said, no, I did something wrong.
[00:37:20.782 --> 00:37:21.402]  I did my time.
[00:37:21.402 --> 00:37:29.705]  And I said, well, I didn't want to say because he's black, but I almost said, because it's the example I'd usually use, really was it was the law that black people were slaves and weren't human.
[00:37:29.705 --> 00:37:31.266]  It's going to follow that law.
[00:37:32.964 --> 00:37:34.284]  It was the law women couldn't vote.
[00:37:34.284 --> 00:37:34.905]  You gonna follow that?
[00:37:34.905 --> 00:37:36.345]  It was the law you couldn't go buy a beer.
[00:37:36.345 --> 00:37:37.766]  You go to jail for it.
[00:37:37.766 --> 00:37:38.286]  Prohibition.
[00:37:38.286 --> 00:37:39.046]  You gonna follow that?
[00:37:39.046 --> 00:37:40.407]  I mean, look.
[00:37:40.407 --> 00:37:44.108]  Freedom isn't something you compromise on.
[00:37:44.108 --> 00:37:51.390]  And the minute you get it through your head, America, and the rest of the world, that a bunch of crooks are running things, we can turn this around.
[00:37:51.390 --> 00:37:53.711]  And I'm gonna go to your calls, but I want to add this final caveat.
[00:37:53.711 --> 00:37:56.292]  I'm gonna get into it more later because it's in my stack here.
[00:37:56.292 --> 00:37:58.253]  Got a couple articles.
[00:37:58.253 --> 00:38:01.754]  The BBC of all groups
[00:38:02.952 --> 00:38:11.139]  Has had to come out and admit 5,000 years ago, there was half the ice in the Arctic there is today.
[00:38:11.139 --> 00:38:20.386]  Now, for years, they will show you a satellite above the North Pole, showing you in the winter months, the ice shrinking by about half.
[00:38:20.386 --> 00:38:26.371]  And say, when they show people that and say, look, it's shrinking, my gosh, it'll be gone one year, as Al Gore says, every year.
[00:38:27.253 --> 00:38:40.259]  Now, that's why there's the North Passages for thousands of years written about for Northern Europeans and others, and the Japanese as well, that you could go through there in the summer.
[00:38:40.259 --> 00:38:42.840]  And if you go early in the spring, you need an icebreaker.
[00:38:42.840 --> 00:38:44.881]  It's gotten thin, but you can get through it.
[00:38:44.881 --> 00:38:49.503]  Everybody knows that half of that ice shelf in the North melts every year.
[00:38:49.503 --> 00:38:52.024]  It's a smaller percentage of the Antarctic.
[00:38:52.024 --> 00:38:52.865]  You can pull the numbers up.
[00:38:53.689 --> 00:38:57.871]  It's like when the news says a polar bear can't swim and shows one swimming and says they're drowning.
[00:38:57.871 --> 00:38:59.132]  It turned out, of course, that's a total lie.
[00:38:59.132 --> 00:39:01.813]  They're the greatest swimming land animal there is.
[00:39:01.813 --> 00:39:03.494]  Recorded swimming upwards of 300 miles.
[00:39:03.494 --> 00:39:06.675]  They hunt in the water, killing seals and beluga whale.
[00:39:06.675 --> 00:39:10.137]  They can haul a beluga whale up with one arm.
[00:39:10.137 --> 00:39:11.258]  Okay?
[00:39:11.258 --> 00:39:15.500]  I mean, a polar bear will eat a grizzly bear's lunch, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:39:15.500 --> 00:39:17.301]  They're completely powerful.
[00:39:17.301 --> 00:39:17.561]  Okay?
[00:39:18.507 --> 00:39:22.330]  In fact, there's nothing walking around more vicious on the planet.
[00:39:22.330 --> 00:39:23.912]  But they tell you, oh, they're dying!
[00:39:23.912 --> 00:39:24.933]  Oh, it's melting!
[00:39:24.933 --> 00:39:26.294]  Look at them out of that iceberg!
[00:39:26.294 --> 00:39:28.175]  Yeah, they're hunting!
[00:39:28.175 --> 00:39:41.227]  And the people telling you that are congenital, conscious liars to make you feel guilty so they can put a carbon tax on you to pay it to Al Gore and Lord Rothschild and David Rockefeller on record, who openly run the carbon trading facilities.
[00:39:44.062 --> 00:39:45.163]  Now, that came out.
[00:39:45.163 --> 00:39:58.071]  The BBC had to admit, okay, 5,000 years ago, the ice sheet was half of what it is now, and it looks like it's natural.
[00:39:58.071 --> 00:39:59.852]  The Hadron Collider info came out.
[00:39:59.852 --> 00:40:02.073]  They mimicked the ions coming out of space.
[00:40:02.073 --> 00:40:03.795]  That's what's forming most of the clouds.
[00:40:03.795 --> 00:40:05.576]  That was known 20 years ago.
[00:40:05.576 --> 00:40:06.616]  We told you that.
[00:40:06.616 --> 00:40:10.539]  But the UN had a vote two years ago saying, no, we say it doesn't affect it.
[00:40:11.192 --> 00:40:14.393]  We say sunlight doesn't make plants grow.
[00:40:14.393 --> 00:40:19.355]  We say... I mean, okay, you say the Earth's flat.
[00:40:19.355 --> 00:40:21.916]  Go lock Copernicus up.
[00:40:21.916 --> 00:40:23.276]  You say Galileo's wrong.
[00:40:23.276 --> 00:40:24.577]  Lock him up.
[00:40:24.577 --> 00:40:30.879]  The Earth's not the center of the universe and the planets move.
[00:40:30.879 --> 00:40:36.181]  So now another big report came out where they're having to admit that
[00:40:38.231 --> 00:40:43.676]  Increasing temperature ups CO2, not CO2 ups the temperature.
[00:40:43.676 --> 00:40:45.338]  You know, Al Gore lied.
[00:40:45.338 --> 00:40:46.018]  He's been caught.
[00:40:46.018 --> 00:40:48.921]  In fact, in British court, they ordered it pulled out of the schools.
[00:40:48.921 --> 00:40:53.545]  His inconvenient propaganda, his inconvenient man-bear-pig, his inconvenient truth.
[00:40:53.545 --> 00:40:54.907]  Excuse me, got the name right the third time.
[00:40:56.124 --> 00:41:02.430]  He took the graph and shows CO2 going up and then temperature going up, and it turns out it's flipped.
[00:41:02.430 --> 00:41:15.563]  He actually took public data that was publicly available, but he knew he didn't know how to go look that up, and flipped it, and showed you a graphic of a baby polar bear, a cartoon of one dying, couldn't swim, dying.
[00:41:15.563 --> 00:41:16.284]  The minute
[00:41:18.216 --> 00:41:21.679]  In fact, guys, I forget if it was 67 or 69, I think it's 67.
[00:41:21.679 --> 00:41:23.640]  Pull up yesterday's article, I never got to it.
[00:41:23.640 --> 00:41:29.184]  Rasmussen poll, 67% believe global warming science is lying.
[00:41:29.184 --> 00:41:31.405]  Just put that on screen, I want to double check my number.
[00:41:31.405 --> 00:41:36.269]  But I believe it's 67% now in a Rasmussen poll don't believe it.
[00:41:36.269 --> 00:41:43.033]  See, it went from 9 out of 10 three years ago believing it, because the media wouldn't lie, to now
[00:41:44.125 --> 00:41:48.408]  Six or almost seven out of ten not believing it, and it's accelerating.
[00:41:48.408 --> 00:41:52.211]  Once you wake up to the fraud, it's all over!
[00:41:52.211 --> 00:41:54.153]  But you've got to do it!
[00:41:54.153 --> 00:41:56.295]  You've got to stop being naive!
[00:41:56.295 --> 00:42:02.399]  The day you hear this show and think that it's not radical is the day you've woken up.
[00:42:02.399 --> 00:42:03.380]  Okay?
[00:42:03.380 --> 00:42:04.341]  It's that simple.
[00:42:04.341 --> 00:42:10.786]  Because even if I'm not right about 100% of things, and Lord knows I make mistakes about stuff routinely and try to go back and cover it when I do,
[00:42:11.843 --> 00:42:20.087]  The point is, is that in history, the things I'm talking about have happened over and over again, and we're seeing a lot of it happen now, and it's good to be alarmist.
[00:42:20.087 --> 00:42:21.328]  It's good to be upset.
[00:42:21.328 --> 00:42:22.448]  It's good to be defending Liberty.
[00:42:22.448 --> 00:42:25.130]  Okay, I'm going to shut up now and go to your calls.
[00:42:25.130 --> 00:42:28.972]  Did you find my Rasmussen?
[00:42:28.972 --> 00:42:30.492]  Here, watch this.
[00:42:30.492 --> 00:42:31.013]  Watch this.
[00:42:31.013 --> 00:42:32.793]  Rasmussen.
[00:42:32.793 --> 00:42:35.135]  Rasmussen. 67%
[00:42:42.230 --> 00:42:44.192]  Think.
[00:42:44.192 --> 00:42:47.997]  Scientist.
[00:42:47.997 --> 00:42:50.039]  Lying.
[00:42:50.039 --> 00:42:52.722]  Boom.
[00:42:52.722 --> 00:42:54.284]  Okay, I was wrong.
[00:42:54.284 --> 00:42:55.725]  I'm sorry and I apologize.
[00:42:57.182 --> 00:42:58.482]  Yes, put it on screen for folks.
[00:42:58.482 --> 00:42:59.383]  He found it as well.
[00:42:59.383 --> 00:43:00.763]  I apologize.
[00:43:00.763 --> 00:43:04.224]  As I told you, I'm now spot-checking almost everything I say on air.
[00:43:04.224 --> 00:43:05.205]  My memory failed.
[00:43:05.205 --> 00:43:10.606]  69% say it's likely scientists have falsified global warming data.
[00:43:10.606 --> 00:43:13.367]  And again, we'll put that on screen or you can document cam, shot it off right here.
[00:43:13.367 --> 00:43:15.968]  Thank you.
[00:43:15.968 --> 00:43:17.149]  Because people are going to say that's a lie.
[00:43:17.149 --> 00:43:18.489]  We must show them or they're not going to believe it.
[00:43:18.489 --> 00:43:19.429]  They're not going to look it up.
[00:43:19.429 --> 00:43:20.450]  They're going to say I'm making it up.
[00:43:20.450 --> 00:43:21.310]  I've got to show them this.
[00:43:24.887 --> 00:43:29.452]  Again, you can just type in 69% and say it's likely scientists have falsified global warming research.
[00:43:29.452 --> 00:43:30.232]  There it is.
[00:43:30.232 --> 00:43:31.353]  Rasmussen.
[00:43:31.353 --> 00:43:32.555]  And they won't believe that either.
[00:43:32.555 --> 00:43:34.657]  Pull back, let them see where it says Rasmussen Reports.
[00:43:37.153 --> 00:43:42.255]  In fact, they're not going to believe, you know, my BBC about the ICE thing, so I'll have to get that and show it to them.
[00:43:42.255 --> 00:43:45.477]  The point is, is that we're being lied to.
[00:43:45.477 --> 00:43:57.643]  I mean, I've gotten more articles in the mainstream news today dealing with the federal court documents coming out that top drug cartel leaders do indeed, they filed them in evidence, work for the U.S.
[00:43:57.643 --> 00:43:58.403]  government.
[00:43:58.403 --> 00:44:03.866]  And we're using them to knock out their competition, and that reportedly 3,000 people have died, including many police,
[00:44:05.205 --> 00:44:19.929]  It is estimated that approximately 3,000 people were killed in Mexico as a result of Operation Fast and Furious, including law enforcement officers in the state of Sinaloa, Mexico, the headquarters of the Sinaloa Cartel, the court documents allege.
[00:44:19.929 --> 00:44:21.710]  And it goes on with the Justice Department.
[00:44:21.710 --> 00:44:23.571]  Okay, let's go to your phone calls.
[00:44:23.571 --> 00:44:25.391]  I've got to have open phones here.
[00:44:25.391 --> 00:44:26.792]  Jack in Michigan, you're on the air.
[00:44:26.792 --> 00:44:28.732]  Thanks for holding.
[00:44:28.732 --> 00:44:31.433]  Hey, Alex, you are a true blue.
[00:44:33.362 --> 00:44:37.885]  Patriot spirit, brother, in the League of Bold Brights.
[00:44:37.885 --> 00:44:43.549]  The last time I was politically active, I supported Bold Brights.
[00:44:43.549 --> 00:44:59.759]  And in my lifetime, since I was too young to know JFK, but I did learn that had Bold been elected, of course, we wouldn't be in the position we're in now because he would have terminated the Federal Reserve.
[00:44:59.759 --> 00:45:01.841]  And really, all we've got to do, since it's
[00:45:03.098 --> 00:45:07.002]  It's uninformed consent fraud.
[00:45:07.002 --> 00:45:12.388]  It is simply paying back their original $500,000,000 flush.
[00:45:12.388 --> 00:45:14.209]  We'll give them a billion, right?
[00:45:14.209 --> 00:45:19.375]  And if they don't leave, we'll just, you know, throw them a big party over there with the polar bears.
[00:45:20.379 --> 00:45:22.761]  And see how well they can swim with the polar bears.
[00:45:42.432 --> 00:45:42.873]  Hey Alex, uh...
[00:45:56.638 --> 00:46:00.181]  The golden rule has got everybody enslaved, right?
[00:46:00.181 --> 00:46:02.862]  Who controls the gold, the currency rules?
[00:46:02.862 --> 00:46:20.575]  So, I have a report from a fellow that used to be an aide to a federal judge, and it describes the intrinsic insidious fraud of all loan agreements, whether it's credit cards, mortgages, whatever.
[00:46:20.575 --> 00:46:23.557]  The promissory note, and you can, the clue
[00:46:24.153 --> 00:46:33.500]  If you haven't already been told this, if you have a checking account, you scope it with a magnifying glass, and you see a miniature dot matrix, the words, Authorized Signature.
[00:46:33.500 --> 00:46:51.614]  So, it so happens, just like on the promissory note, everyone signs with the loan agreement, which is a contract, uh, you know, Authorized Signature is, is authorizing the creation of the money, or the currency that funds the loan.
[00:46:51.614 --> 00:46:52.035]  So the,
[00:46:52.898 --> 00:46:58.800]  The loan company, whatever it is, is not loaning from their assets nor those of their client depositors.
[00:46:58.800 --> 00:47:04.301]  It's the contracting borrower that's creating the currency that funds Israel.
[00:47:04.301 --> 00:47:06.482]  Yes, yes, that's fractional reserve banking.
[00:47:06.482 --> 00:47:08.903]  Good point and I appreciate your call.
[00:47:08.903 --> 00:47:12.904]  And then they just expand that out into derivatives.
[00:47:14.002 --> 00:47:18.347]  And that's why banks are now, you got to pay us to keep cash here, but we're like, but you're loaning it out.
[00:47:18.347 --> 00:47:24.553]  They're like, buddy, we don't care about fractional reserve banking, loaning out 10 to 1 now and making money up out of nothing.
[00:47:24.553 --> 00:47:28.397]  We can make up whatever we want, as long as you're a big mega bank.
[00:47:28.397 --> 00:47:33.463]  Now, if your local credit union gets a crooked toenail, they're going to be SWAT team so fast, it'll make your head spin.
[00:47:34.087 --> 00:47:41.673]  And that's also what's happening is the big mega banks are taking over all the real legitimate banks that actually do help fund this country.
[00:47:41.673 --> 00:47:44.535]  Let's go ahead and talk to Dave in Canada.
[00:47:44.535 --> 00:47:45.435]  Dave, you're on the air.
[00:47:45.435 --> 00:47:46.356]  Welcome.
[00:47:46.356 --> 00:47:47.017]  Hi Alex.
[00:47:47.017 --> 00:47:48.538]  Thanks so much for taking my call.
[00:47:48.538 --> 00:47:50.059]  I'm calling from Windsor.
[00:47:50.059 --> 00:47:51.640]  We are Change Windsor.
[00:47:51.640 --> 00:47:52.641]  We've been quite busy here.
[00:47:53.779 --> 00:47:56.261]  Trying to keep active, trying to wake people up.
[00:47:56.261 --> 00:47:59.423]  Yeah, I'd like to see if I can ask you a couple questions.
[00:47:59.423 --> 00:48:05.448]  First of all, is it possible for me to just mention some issues that are going on in Canada?
[00:48:05.448 --> 00:48:06.949]  Sir, we didn't screen your call.
[00:48:06.949 --> 00:48:11.212]  I mean, if I don't like what you're getting into or I think it's a distraction or something, I just hang up on people.
[00:48:11.212 --> 00:48:12.153]  But yeah, go ahead.
[00:48:12.153 --> 00:48:12.493]  Welcome!
[00:48:13.300 --> 00:48:16.703]  Yeah, the second call, or the second issue is just the website that we have.
[00:48:16.703 --> 00:48:19.605]  Anyway, yeah, in Canada here we have a lot of things going on.
[00:48:19.605 --> 00:48:22.828]  I don't want to make things seem too pessimistic, but you know, it is what it is.
[00:48:22.828 --> 00:48:25.390]  So anyway, we're having a lot of factory closures.
[00:48:25.390 --> 00:48:31.015]  Navistar, our last large truck manufacturing plant, closed a little while ago.
[00:48:31.015 --> 00:48:33.277]  You're enjoying the blessings of globalism!
[00:48:34.157 --> 00:48:40.923]  Remember Al Gore told you on Larry King Live in 1994, Larry, this is a good deal.
[00:48:40.923 --> 00:48:44.106]  Over the next ten years it's going to double our factories, Larry.
[00:48:44.106 --> 00:48:47.469]  And again, he wouldn't lie to us, he's Al Gore.
[00:48:47.469 --> 00:48:51.412]  He told us polar bears can't swim, come now, tsk tsk.
[00:48:51.412 --> 00:48:52.874]  Are you talking bad about Al Gore?
[00:48:55.154 --> 00:48:56.555]  Okay, please continue, Evil One.
[00:48:56.555 --> 00:48:57.976]  Oh, it's done wonderful.
[00:48:57.976 --> 00:49:01.557]  They want to build a new bridge just to accommodate all the increased traffic.
[00:49:01.557 --> 00:49:02.738]  I'm being sarcastic, obviously.
[00:49:14.531 --> 00:49:22.653]  That's another thing is that the studies show that the traffic has actually dropped since 2001, but they want to build another bridge, another crossing.
[00:49:22.653 --> 00:49:28.514]  And they're fighting with the government, one private investor is fighting with the government to build his bridge.
[00:49:28.514 --> 00:49:30.975]  And it's just, it's absolutely crazy.
[00:49:30.975 --> 00:49:31.755]  I hear you.
[00:49:31.755 --> 00:49:34.856]  You know, I'll be honest with you.
[00:49:34.856 --> 00:49:42.398]  All of these are side issues to, you heard Dr. Catherine Albrecht battling stage three cancer, breast cancer yesterday here on air.
[00:49:43.491 --> 00:49:49.975]  And you heard her talk about how the United States is off the charts statistically, higher breast cancer than anywhere else in the world.
[00:49:49.975 --> 00:49:51.716]  Next is Western Europe.
[00:49:51.716 --> 00:49:56.019]  And it is the bisphenol A. It is the hormones in the food, the meat.
[00:49:56.019 --> 00:49:56.839]  And we're murdering.
[00:49:56.839 --> 00:49:59.621]  I mean, just look at your daughters.
[00:49:59.621 --> 00:50:01.502]  You're giving them a death sentence.
[00:50:01.502 --> 00:50:05.445]  Because if this stuff has roughly doubled in the last decade, what about a decade from now?
[00:50:06.630 --> 00:50:08.051]  What about a decade after that?
[00:50:08.051 --> 00:50:14.996]  What about the fact that 50 years ago, a child with cancer was like the holy grail to doctors.
[00:50:14.996 --> 00:50:18.579]  They would travel from all over the world to come see the child.
[00:50:18.579 --> 00:50:32.990]  Now there's, go anywhere, you see kids with cancer, with their hair all falling out, a lot of times with the bug poison injectors, the chemotherapy injectors on their arms, or the ports, you'll see them at the swimming pool, the ports sticking out of their chest.
[00:50:33.370 --> 00:50:36.093]  And they're going to have all their money sucked out of them and terminated.
[00:50:36.093 --> 00:50:37.714]  Yeah, I think that's the big issue.
[00:50:37.714 --> 00:50:38.835]  You know what I mean?
[00:50:38.835 --> 00:50:41.277]  GMO crops designed to sterilize us.
[00:50:41.277 --> 00:50:43.259]  We're being murdered right now.
[00:50:43.259 --> 00:50:46.162]  Cop listening right now, say, in Florida, giggling.
[00:50:46.162 --> 00:50:46.922]  He's a new listener.
[00:50:46.922 --> 00:50:47.203]  Okay.
[00:50:47.203 --> 00:50:48.844]  It's not funny.
[00:50:48.844 --> 00:50:54.089]  You know, I say cop because a lot of folks that are part of the system think that, oh, the government couldn't be doing that.
[00:50:54.089 --> 00:50:57.452]  You ignore this information at your peril.
[00:50:57.452 --> 00:50:58.433]  We're being soft killed.
[00:50:58.433 --> 00:50:59.094]  More calls straight ahead.
[00:51:02.950 --> 00:51:04.171]  This is not a drill.
[00:51:04.171 --> 00:51:06.693]  Repeat, this is not a drill.
[00:51:06.693 --> 00:51:08.574]  Gun sales are on a staggering pace.
[00:51:08.574 --> 00:51:15.799]  Gun prices are going through the roof and that means desperate, vicious criminals now want your guns and will do anything to get them.
[00:51:15.799 --> 00:51:20.182]  Now a new book reveals powerful secrets for hiding your guns from thieves and looters.

[00:54:16.671 --> 00:54:18.673]  We'll go on back to them here in a moment.

[00:54:26.138 --> 00:54:27.800]  I do not screen your phone calls.
[00:54:29.051 --> 00:54:32.494]  Okay, and so what happens is we just ask your name, where you're calling from.
[00:54:32.494 --> 00:54:33.996]  If you want to tell us how you're listening, fine.
[00:54:33.996 --> 00:54:35.978]  I usually don't even read that information off.
[00:54:35.978 --> 00:54:38.020]  I probably should, because it's interesting.
[00:54:38.020 --> 00:54:39.361]  People like to hear it.
[00:54:39.361 --> 00:54:42.524]  And then I get callers on air, and they, like, want me to screen their call.
[00:54:42.524 --> 00:54:44.125]  Is it all right if I talk about this?
[00:54:44.125 --> 00:54:45.326]  Is it all right if I talk about that?
[00:54:47.348 --> 00:54:49.309]  Or they say, I heard you screen calls.
[00:54:49.309 --> 00:54:50.891]  I can't believe I got on.
[00:54:50.891 --> 00:54:54.313]  Well, folks, you can also hear that I work for space aliens.
[00:54:54.313 --> 00:54:55.594]  It isn't true.
[00:54:55.594 --> 00:55:00.418]  So if you want to get involved on air, it's 800-259-9231.
[00:55:00.418 --> 00:55:03.400]  Ken, Tanner, Tim, Dustery, many others.

[00:55:43.561 --> 00:55:45.023]  I mean, you talk about totally illegal.
[00:55:48.137 --> 00:55:50.838]  Twelve triggers driving mankind towards world government.
[00:55:50.838 --> 00:55:51.818]  Key article.
[00:55:51.818 --> 00:55:52.879]  I want to go over later.
[00:55:52.879 --> 00:55:53.659]  Russian envoy.
[00:55:53.659 --> 00:55:56.260]  NATO is planning attacks on Syria and Iran.

[00:56:08.288 --> 00:56:12.150]  And there was a report yesterday that sweat on your hands is triggering the bomb.
[00:56:12.150 --> 00:56:19.835]  I mean, ladies and gentlemen, I hadn't been working in the garden or anything, and last time I flew, they, ooh, explosives, and swabbed me down, and ooh, ooh!
[00:56:19.835 --> 00:56:21.656]  No, I don't work for the big banks, okay?
[00:56:21.656 --> 00:56:28.320]  I didn't get Muttalib on the plane like the State Department was ordered to do so, so don't worry, we're not the ones that need to be worried about.
[00:56:28.820 --> 00:56:31.182]  Okay, I'm going to go to your calls here.
[00:56:31.182 --> 00:56:32.543]  Also, there's another article.
[00:56:32.543 --> 00:56:38.808]  57 senators signed a letter to protect 2nd Amendment from UN Global Treaty that Hillary's trying to get signed.
[00:56:38.808 --> 00:56:40.089]  And don't think they won't pass it.
[00:56:40.089 --> 00:56:41.990]  You thought you wouldn't get government-run health care.
[00:56:41.990 --> 00:56:43.892]  You thought you wouldn't get a super Congress.
[00:56:43.892 --> 00:56:46.354]  You thought Obama wouldn't launch wars without congressional approval.
[00:56:47.154 --> 00:56:52.098]  You thought the TSA wouldn't grab the outside of your pants, much less the inside of your pants.
[00:56:52.098 --> 00:56:53.379]  Well, look at every other country.
[00:56:53.379 --> 00:57:01.306]  This is what happens when the thugs get in charge and hire a bunch of dumbed-down control freaks who'll do whatever they're told.
[00:57:01.306 --> 00:57:04.669]  It's a recipe for absolute tyranny.
[00:57:07.486 --> 00:57:08.507]  Oh, they'll let you.
[00:57:08.507 --> 00:57:15.810]  Remember I kept telling you about them not letting people have gardens and demanding inspections before you could have one because you might grow something illegal.
[00:57:15.810 --> 00:57:18.072]  You're guilty until proven innocent.
[00:57:18.072 --> 00:57:19.552]  And now the reports are pouring in.
[00:57:19.552 --> 00:57:22.514]  You can't have a garden in your backyard, your front yard.
[00:57:22.514 --> 00:57:24.095]  It's happening.
[00:57:24.095 --> 00:57:27.476]  Oh, you can't sell papayas and mangoes that are organic.
[00:57:27.476 --> 00:57:29.337]  You know, you can't sell this organic cheese.
[00:57:29.337 --> 00:57:30.218]  We're raiding you.
[00:57:31.946 --> 00:57:35.589]  And it's only going to get worse because they are more and more criminal.
[00:57:35.589 --> 00:57:38.130]  The criminals are taking more and more of the slots.
[00:57:38.130 --> 00:57:45.876]  They've got more than half the people in government have now been basically criminals or control freaks.
[00:57:45.876 --> 00:57:46.436]  Okay?
[00:57:46.436 --> 00:57:48.158]  And they got corporate masters that love it.
[00:57:48.158 --> 00:57:51.940]  We're going to go to break here in a minute and come back with your calls.

[01:00:22.592 --> 01:00:28.673]  Well, the Plunge Protection Team's in there pumping your tax money into select insider stocks right now.
[01:00:28.673 --> 01:00:34.674]  The market dropped 512 points yesterday, went up a little bit in early trading and dropped over 200 points.
[01:00:34.674 --> 01:00:40.676]  It's since shot up 124 points since the close yesterday and is still rocketing upwards.
[01:00:40.676 --> 01:00:46.737]  We'll be looking at that and a host of other important news, but I want to go right back to your calls on this open line Friday.
[01:00:47.897 --> 01:00:52.499]  And up next is Ken in California, then Tanner, Dustery, Sheldon, Mike, and others.
[01:00:52.499 --> 01:00:54.540]  Welcome, Ken.
[01:00:54.540 --> 01:00:55.000]  Hey, Alex.
[01:00:55.000 --> 01:00:55.540]  How you doing?
[01:00:55.540 --> 01:00:56.840]  Good.
[01:00:56.840 --> 01:00:58.161]  Good.
[01:00:58.161 --> 01:00:59.882]  I'm YouTube's father of my five.
[01:00:59.882 --> 01:01:03.023]  We have a lot of videos that kind of parallel.
[01:01:03.023 --> 01:01:10.846]  You were talking earlier about the recession, and it kind of gets me wondering how much of our news is actually made in Hollywood.
[01:01:10.846 --> 01:01:13.787]  I'm sitting here right now, and I'm looking across the way here,
[01:01:14.674 --> 01:01:37.237]  And there is a casino being built, and not just a little casino, there's a really nice casino being built actively right now, and as I travel around the country trying to, you know, get ideas for videos and show things, these really expensive hotels, all the parking lots are full of cars, I mean, so I'm wondering about this recession a little, if that's what I'm trying to...
[01:01:39.233 --> 01:01:43.356]  Well, you know, if you've lost your job, it's a depression.
[01:01:43.356 --> 01:01:46.119]  But if your neighbor just got a raise, it's a boom time.
[01:01:46.119 --> 01:01:49.141]  So these are all done in averages.
[01:01:49.141 --> 01:01:56.847]  You know, environmentalists will go out and aim a camera at San Diego's water and say, I don't see a great white shark, their numbers are down.
[01:01:56.847 --> 01:02:00.930]  But then you can look at statistics where some areas their numbers are up.
[01:02:00.930 --> 01:02:02.412]  Economics is in averages.
[01:02:03.232 --> 01:02:13.265]  And if you look at the overall averages, the economy is in a depression for the last three years.
[01:02:13.265 --> 01:02:15.888]  And we've had many economists on to break that down.
[01:02:15.888 --> 01:02:17.951]  Many restaurants I like to go to are out of business.
[01:02:18.431 --> 01:02:45.746]  prices are up inflation is increasing uh... food stamps you know what was it just six seven years ago we had about twenty five million on it now it's forty five million and then there's another five million or so there on supplemental so it's almost fifty million so so those are all major numbers but yes there are people working for defense contractors and people working for government and people working for sectors of the economy that are good uh... but there's also people uh... gambling
[01:02:46.646 --> 01:02:52.769]  Who are in there running up credit cards or spending their sons and daughters college fund on that.
[01:02:52.769 --> 01:03:00.412]  So just because a casino has its parking lot full.
[01:03:00.412 --> 01:03:12.237]  Yeah, I mean, there's probably 50 cars out there of young 20 year old beauty queens who can't get a job or survive on a school teacher salary or as an accountant or as a scientist.
[01:03:12.237 --> 01:03:14.738]  So she's in there doing sexual acts.
[01:03:15.678 --> 01:03:22.503]  And Daddy's in there, 50-something years old, spending the kids' college funds at the casino.
[01:03:22.503 --> 01:03:40.457]  So, I mean, to say that you're seeing the economy look like it's doing great, I mean, I can take you down to a restaurant and show every area filled, because it's popular, but then I can go show you the housing numbers or whatever.
[01:03:40.457 --> 01:03:44.140]  I mean, the economy isn't... It's kind of like this.
[01:03:45.461 --> 01:03:48.442]  We have more people today getting cancer than we did previously.
[01:03:48.442 --> 01:03:50.042]  That's not debatable or diabetes.
[01:03:50.042 --> 01:03:57.904]  Now I can go show you a triathlete in perfect shape with bronze skin and six-pack stomach and say, I don't think diabetes is up in America.
[01:03:57.904 --> 01:03:59.184]  This guy looks great.
[01:03:59.184 --> 01:04:06.065]  But I can also take you to a bus stop where, you know, a third of the people I drive by and see have had their legs cut off because of it.
[01:04:06.065 --> 01:04:12.927]  So, again, you don't just like spot-check things to then say, well, that's where the economy is.
[01:04:12.927 --> 01:04:14.367]  Does that answer your question, Ken?
[01:04:15.419 --> 01:04:16.461]  Oh, kinda.
[01:04:16.461 --> 01:04:30.760]  It's a little off, but I'm comparing what the news says compared to what I'm seeing, and I'm just, I'm seeing casinos, I'm seeing something else that I'm seeing, well, besides the cancer and diabetes, I can go on and on about those, is the racial thing.
[01:04:32.797 --> 01:04:41.563]  As I'm traveling through California, I'm noticing a lot of churches that are talking about stop the black on black violence.
[01:04:41.563 --> 01:04:44.605]  I don't understand why it has to be black on black violence.
[01:04:44.605 --> 01:04:47.467]  Why can't it just be stop the violence?
[01:04:47.467 --> 01:04:49.288]  How did race get interjected into this?
[01:04:51.522 --> 01:04:52.022]  I hear you.
[01:04:52.022 --> 01:04:53.323]  It's a great question, Ken.
[01:04:53.323 --> 01:04:55.064]  Let me comment on that when we come back.
[01:04:55.064 --> 01:04:55.864]  I appreciate your call.
[01:04:55.864 --> 01:05:00.546]  Then Tanner, Dusty, Sheldon, Mike, and others, we'll be right back.
[01:05:00.546 --> 01:05:01.326]  800-259-9231.
[01:05:01.326 --> 01:05:08.009]  When you're out on the road, the last place you want to be is on the road.
[01:05:08.009 --> 01:05:13.131]  But if the unfortunate happens, you'll be glad you were wearing diamond gussets.
[01:05:13.131 --> 01:05:19.914]  There's a place down in Tennessee where they make blue diamond gusset jeans.
[01:05:21.874 --> 01:05:28.206]  They sew pride in every stitch Guarantee you love the way they fit
[01:05:30.356 --> 01:05:34.939]  They put a Diamond Gusset in the crotch where you need it most.
[01:05:34.939 --> 01:05:38.801]  Blue Diamond Gussets got it.
[01:05:38.801 --> 01:05:40.022]  Others don't.
[01:05:40.022 --> 01:05:42.163]  We turn jeans inside out.
[01:05:42.163 --> 01:05:43.944]  Diamond Gusset Jeans.
[01:05:43.944 --> 01:05:46.846]  Made in the USA with unparalleled quality.
[01:05:46.846 --> 01:05:51.069]  Our Defender Motorcycle Jeans combine Gusset comfort with Kevlar protection.

[01:05:56.172 --> 01:05:58.533]  Diamond Gusset Jeans got it.
[01:05:58.533 --> 01:05:59.394]  Others don't.
[01:06:00.592 --> 01:06:05.135]  This is Alex Jones with 5 good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[01:06:05.135 --> 01:06:06.056]  Number 1.
[01:06:06.056 --> 01:06:09.479]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[01:06:09.479 --> 01:06:10.339]  Number 2.
[01:06:10.339 --> 01:06:15.223]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[01:06:15.223 --> 01:06:15.983]  It's true.
[01:06:15.983 --> 01:06:20.847]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[01:06:20.847 --> 01:06:21.668]  Number 3.
[01:06:21.668 --> 01:06:25.250]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[01:06:25.250 --> 01:06:28.953]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[01:06:29.153 --> 01:06:29.954]  Number 4.
[01:06:29.954 --> 01:06:32.716]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[01:06:32.716 --> 01:06:36.399]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[01:06:36.399 --> 01:06:37.180]  Number 5.
[01:06:37.180 --> 01:06:41.344]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[01:06:41.344 --> 01:06:46.088]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[01:06:46.388 --> 01:06:50.554]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.

[01:07:01.257 --> 01:07:16.734]  You've heard Alex explain how the Silver Lungs Generator infuses the respiratory system with your self-produced colloidal silver solutions, yet many are unaware of the entire function of the Silver Lungs System and how it has been designed to deliver your silver solutions anywhere in or on the body.
[01:07:16.734 --> 01:07:20.418]  My name is Mario Cifaldi and I'm the developer of the Silver Lungs Generator.
[01:07:21.417 --> 01:07:34.169]  Not only does the Silver Lung System produce endless colloidal and ionic silver solutions, it also comes equipped with the proper applicators and devices needed to deliver your silver solutions directly to key target areas.
[01:07:34.169 --> 01:07:41.435]  This includes the eyes, ears, nose, lungs, topically to the skin, and orally for the digestive system.
[01:07:42.136 --> 01:07:52.501]  Be sure to watch our new 7-minute video tour of the Silver Lungs System at www.SilverLungs.com to learn more about how the Silver Lungs System works.
[01:07:52.501 --> 01:07:56.422]  As well, we are always ready to answer any questions you may have.

[01:08:01.124 --> 01:08:06.407]  Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[01:08:06.407 --> 01:08:08.688]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[01:08:14.944 --> 01:08:16.044]  We are back live.
[01:08:16.044 --> 01:08:18.786]  We are now eight minutes into hour number two.
[01:08:18.786 --> 01:08:31.251]  We have Bob Chapman of the International Forecaster, incredible economic analyst, joining us as he does every Friday with a little treat today, because I like to combo up our regular guest from time to time.
[01:08:31.251 --> 01:08:39.394]  In the second half of the interview, Dr. Paul Craig Roberts, former head of policy at the Treasury Department under Reagan, the father of Reaganomics, former Wall Street Journal editor.
[01:08:40.274 --> 01:08:47.383]  He has pointed out that raising the debt ceiling and lowering it, it's all a distraction from the derivatives and the offshoring of jobs.
[01:08:48.399 --> 01:08:54.480]  And so we're going to get his economic outlook with both those men together coming up today.
[01:08:54.480 --> 01:08:55.541]  Very excited about that.
[01:08:55.541 --> 01:09:02.222]  I will continue with your calls interspersed with little nuggets of news.
[01:09:02.222 --> 01:09:07.963]  And I just had a caller, if you just joined us, Ken in California, then we're going to Tanner, Dusty, Sheldon, Mike and others.
[01:09:07.963 --> 01:09:09.384]  And by the way, the toll free number to join us is 800-259-9231.
[01:09:09.384 --> 01:09:09.764]  And I haven't
[01:09:15.990 --> 01:09:22.176]  Covered the subject a lot that Ken mentioned because I'm not shying away from it.
[01:09:22.176 --> 01:09:29.783]  I do have a problem and that is when something's really, really complex.
[01:09:29.783 --> 01:09:35.189]  And I understand it, but it's hard to explain unless I spent two hours on it.
[01:09:36.291 --> 01:09:52.019]  Kind of going into that public brainstorm mode where I just talk endlessly for a couple hours and you've seen those shows happen and then the show's over and I've basically rattled on for a couple hours about something, hitting every different angle of it because there's so many subjects like that.
[01:09:52.019 --> 01:09:59.763]  There are a lot of subjects that I need to learn the gift of just basically trying to simplify my view on it if somebody's asking my opinion.
[01:10:01.485 --> 01:10:06.967]  And so now I'll try to spend two or three minutes because I want to go to your calls on this subject.
[01:10:06.967 --> 01:10:10.449]  And that is black on white crime.
[01:10:10.449 --> 01:10:19.752]  And every time I do mention this, I get emails and stuff and calls from black folks saying, Alex, I thought, you know, you cared about us.
[01:10:19.752 --> 01:10:20.613]  Why are you saying that?
[01:10:20.613 --> 01:10:21.253]  That isn't true.
[01:10:23.257 --> 01:10:26.858]  Well, you know, I'm against 52% of black people being imported.
[01:10:26.858 --> 01:10:29.539]  I don't like killing kids, okay?
[01:10:29.539 --> 01:10:33.300]  And at the end of the day, I don't dislike black people.
[01:10:33.300 --> 01:10:45.564]  But at the end of the day, I grew up in Dallas, Texas and had a lot of black friends I was on the football team with, but I also was racially attacked, I don't know, probably 10 times, probably more actually by black folks.
[01:10:45.564 --> 01:10:49.225]  And hey, I actually appreciate it.
[01:10:49.225 --> 01:10:51.886]  I mean, those are some of the best experiences of my life now.
[01:10:52.702 --> 01:10:53.162]  Okay?
[01:10:53.162 --> 01:11:01.806]  I mean, that has made me who I am today, that I have been in absolute knockdown, drag out, you know, where I go to the hospital, they go to the hospital.
[01:11:01.806 --> 01:11:03.106]  That's valuable to me.
[01:11:03.106 --> 01:11:05.767]  My permanent black eyes are valuable.
[01:11:05.767 --> 01:11:08.808]  The broken leg I got in a fight's valuable.
[01:11:08.808 --> 01:11:11.089]  The time I got stabbed is valuable.
[01:11:11.089 --> 01:11:12.210]  All of it's very valuable.
[01:11:13.230 --> 01:11:18.352]  Because I'm not the toughest guy in the world, but I've been in some hellacious fights and it's valuable to me.
[01:11:18.352 --> 01:11:23.814]  I don't hate black people just because I've been racially attacked over and over again.
[01:11:23.814 --> 01:11:24.134]  Okay?
[01:11:24.134 --> 01:11:26.374]  I've had Mexicans racially attack me.
[01:11:26.374 --> 01:11:27.755]  Four Mexicans.
[01:11:27.755 --> 01:11:32.936]  Five technically, but only four were pounding on me and calling me racial names while they did it.
[01:11:32.936 --> 01:11:37.298]  And then I tore up a couple of them real bad and they got scared and really hurt me even worse.
[01:11:38.407 --> 01:11:41.289]  They thought they had a rhinoceros on them.
[01:11:41.289 --> 01:11:44.871]  Because the truth is, folks, I have no strength until I'm overwhelmed.
[01:11:44.871 --> 01:11:48.433]  And then, it's clobbering time.
[01:11:48.433 --> 01:11:50.114]  And that's the way it is with anybody.
[01:11:50.114 --> 01:11:56.077]  That's why, as a species, we're not going to be able to stand up to tyranny until things get really bad.
[01:11:56.077 --> 01:11:57.938]  Okay?
[01:11:57.938 --> 01:11:58.939]  It's real simple.
[01:11:58.939 --> 01:12:04.122]  And I also got my teeth loosened and my nose broken by rednecks as well.
[01:12:05.905 --> 01:12:07.065]  Everybody's tribal.
[01:12:07.065 --> 01:12:11.827]  You know, you pull up to a bonfire at a lake, you don't know most of the people, they're tribal.
[01:12:11.827 --> 01:12:19.689]  Big ol' white guys come over wearing their, you know, their Wranglers and their cowboy boots and they're like, what are you doing here, Yankee?
[01:12:19.689 --> 01:12:21.049]  And they start a fight with you.
[01:12:21.049 --> 01:12:25.611]  And then later you learn you pulled in and there were some Klan people there.
[01:12:25.611 --> 01:12:29.452]  Oh yes, that goes on in places like East Texas.
[01:12:29.452 --> 01:12:31.152]  Okay?
[01:12:31.152 --> 01:12:33.353]  So, I've been attacked by the Klan.
[01:12:34.451 --> 01:12:36.611]  I've been attacked by black people.
[01:12:36.611 --> 01:12:38.072]  I've been attacked by Mexicans.
[01:12:38.072 --> 01:12:39.652]  And let me tell you who I've been attacked by.
[01:12:39.652 --> 01:12:41.893]  I've been attacked by tribalists.
[01:12:41.893 --> 01:12:45.633]  It didn't matter if they were white, if they were black, if they were Mexican.
[01:12:45.633 --> 01:12:51.494]  I have been attacked for being an outsider by whites.
[01:12:51.494 --> 01:12:54.935]  Pulling in a pickup truck with a girl a little too good looking.
[01:12:54.935 --> 01:12:57.016]  And I was a little too good looking for him at that time.
[01:12:57.016 --> 01:12:58.616]  I know I'm not too good looking now.
[01:13:00.080 --> 01:13:01.801]  And I've experienced all that.
[01:13:01.801 --> 01:13:12.267]  So when I hear about black people in games beating and robbing whites all over the US, I see it in the news every day, and the media tries to not say it's racial, but then there's the facts.
[01:13:12.267 --> 01:13:12.967]  It's horrible.
[01:13:12.967 --> 01:13:13.928]  It's terrible.
[01:13:13.928 --> 01:13:15.749]  But then do I see a black person and hate them?
[01:13:15.749 --> 01:13:15.949]  No.
[01:13:15.949 --> 01:13:18.050]  Because most black people aren't like that.
[01:13:18.050 --> 01:13:25.174]  And most people wearing Stetson cowboy hats aren't, you know, in some little Klan gang or something.
[01:13:26.855 --> 01:13:36.082]  Again, most Mexicans are not looking to beat the living... I mean, I went to the hospital, folks.
[01:13:37.376 --> 01:13:41.478]  Beat the living daylight and stomp me in from in.
[01:13:41.478 --> 01:13:49.882]  I've had concussions that I couldn't see for two days.
[01:13:49.882 --> 01:13:51.643]  I'm brain damaged, you better get it right.
[01:13:51.643 --> 01:13:58.066]  I've been hit upside the head with an axe handle, a lead pipe, and I shouldn't even get into these stories.
[01:13:58.066 --> 01:13:58.547]  The point is,
[01:13:59.187 --> 01:14:02.408]  Anybody who grew up in Dallas, folks, knows that's the culture up there.
[01:14:02.408 --> 01:14:06.510]  It is just absolute, you know, don't call the cops unless somebody's dead.
[01:14:06.510 --> 01:14:09.731]  I actually like Austin, where fighting isn't put up with.
[01:14:09.731 --> 01:14:13.613]  People start fights with me now, I say, yes sir, mister, you're big and tough.
[01:14:13.613 --> 01:14:15.613]  Unless my family's around, then you better watch out.
[01:14:15.613 --> 01:14:18.134]  But, see, I said I'd spend two or three minutes on this.
[01:14:18.134 --> 01:14:20.775]  How do I describe what's going on?
[01:14:20.775 --> 01:14:26.017]  Black people feel entitled, on average, the type of groups that are attacking folks.
[01:14:26.017 --> 01:14:27.658]  They feel like they've been victimized.
[01:14:28.854 --> 01:14:32.795]  They feel like they're the only slaves who ever were in the history of the world.
[01:14:32.795 --> 01:14:35.696]  They don't know history just like everybody else on average.
[01:14:35.696 --> 01:14:39.518]  And they're very full of themselves, the type that attack whites.
[01:14:39.518 --> 01:14:47.240]  They don't see it as racist when they grab people's purses and punch old ladies in the nose.
[01:14:47.240 --> 01:14:51.562]  And stomp on, you know, somebody calling them White Cracker.
[01:14:51.562 --> 01:14:52.082]  Okay?
[01:14:52.082 --> 01:14:56.883]  Do you think a Klan person, whenever they attack a black person, feels like they're being evil?
[01:14:56.883 --> 01:14:58.104]  No, they think they're in the right too.
[01:14:59.352 --> 01:15:03.255]  Uh, do you think a La Raza person, you know, going out and engaging in racial attacks on whites?
[01:15:03.255 --> 01:15:04.936]  We got video of that stuff, stuff.
[01:15:04.936 --> 01:15:05.836]  Mecha-type people.
[01:15:05.836 --> 01:15:06.397]  No!
[01:15:06.397 --> 01:15:08.878]  They're in a war against the, you know, the devil.
[01:15:08.878 --> 01:15:13.341]  Uh, see, so, so... This is gonna get worse.
[01:15:13.341 --> 01:15:14.482]  We're a tribal country.
[01:15:14.482 --> 01:15:15.943]  Football.
[01:15:15.943 --> 01:15:17.143]  Coke, Pepsi.
[01:15:17.143 --> 01:15:18.184]  Ford, Chevy.
[01:15:18.184 --> 01:15:24.348]  I mean, that's tribalism that people that like Ford had a little image of the, of the guy urinating on the, uh, Chevy symbol.
[01:15:24.348 --> 01:15:25.088]  Or vice versa.
[01:15:25.088 --> 01:15:25.749]  You've all seen it.
[01:15:26.786 --> 01:15:29.128]  That's what it's all about, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:15:29.128 --> 01:15:30.729]  That's what- I'm not against tattoos.
[01:15:30.729 --> 01:15:34.453]  I'm not against guys with the shaved heads and the goatees, you know, that you see everywhere.
[01:15:34.453 --> 01:15:36.734]  Black, white, Hispanic, trying to act tough.
[01:15:36.734 --> 01:15:38.876]  I'm scared of people that want to act tough.
[01:15:38.876 --> 01:15:42.800]  I'm scared of people that want to fight because they haven't been hurt bad enough yet!
[01:15:44.022 --> 01:15:47.065]  They haven't rolled around with somebody pushing a knife into them.
[01:15:47.065 --> 01:15:47.905]  Okay?
[01:15:47.905 --> 01:15:48.866]  They haven't been there.
[01:15:48.866 --> 01:15:52.049]  They haven't been in the big Dallas jails.
[01:15:52.049 --> 01:15:54.350]  They haven't had the jail guards try to rape them.
[01:15:54.350 --> 01:15:55.331]  They haven't lived yet.
[01:15:55.331 --> 01:15:59.174]  They want to be gangster and they don't know what it is!
[01:15:59.174 --> 01:15:59.455]  Okay?
[01:16:01.243 --> 01:16:02.744]  It's that simple.
[01:16:02.744 --> 01:16:10.110]  And so the culture sells that gangsterism and all this garbage is cool, and so the white kids do it, the black kids do it, you name it, they do it.
[01:16:10.110 --> 01:16:15.835]  And you get these welfare generation after generation of people, and all over the country, yes.
[01:16:15.835 --> 01:16:16.715]  Yes, it happens.
[01:16:16.715 --> 01:16:25.783]  I had black guys three years ago at the TSA make fun of me and call me names because I was white, and get off on it and basically ask me if I wanted some trouble.
[01:16:27.252 --> 01:16:33.937]  I've told that story, and I just, you know what, I just basically, I griped at him a little bit, but just got on through the line.
[01:16:33.937 --> 01:16:38.320]  Because the point is, is that I feel sorry for those type of people.
[01:16:38.320 --> 01:16:41.502]  Now, if they physically do something, you gotta defend yourself.
[01:16:41.502 --> 01:16:49.387]  But I do not sit there when a racist black person is racist towards me and hate black people because of it.
[01:16:49.387 --> 01:16:50.668]  Okay?
[01:16:50.668 --> 01:16:55.131]  Any more than I see somebody wearing Wranglers and a cowboy hat, because I've probably been in
[01:16:55.836 --> 01:16:58.537]  It's pretty embarrassing, actually, how many fights I've been in.
[01:16:58.537 --> 01:17:03.499]  I was probably in 10 or more fights with rednecks.
[01:17:03.499 --> 01:17:06.481]  And I mean, I'm not bashing folks that are, you know, work in the country.
[01:17:06.481 --> 01:17:09.162]  I'm from redneck stock myself, if you want to call it that.
[01:17:09.162 --> 01:17:13.844]  The point is, is that I'm not looking for trouble with people.
[01:17:14.699 --> 01:17:16.421]  Okay?
[01:17:16.421 --> 01:17:22.728]  And it's very sad and it's going to get worse because through multiculturalism, they've actually created more tribalism.
[01:17:22.728 --> 01:17:31.417]  It's all about what color you are, what sexual preference, what you're into, what you do.
[01:17:31.417 --> 01:17:35.041]  It's not about what you do, it's about how you look and what group you're in.
[01:17:36.539 --> 01:17:44.221]  Okay, I'm in the free humanity group who wants prosperity and to be left alone and have a decent life.
[01:17:44.221 --> 01:17:47.122]  Okay, that's that's the group I'm in.
[01:17:47.122 --> 01:17:48.002]  I'm into freedom.
[01:17:48.002 --> 01:17:55.044]  I'm into 1776 and no matter whether you're Mexican, black, Latin American, Chinese, I don't care.
[01:17:55.044 --> 01:17:57.245]  You're under eugenics New World Order attack.
[01:17:59.426 --> 01:18:13.659]  And yes, it is dangerous and it's getting worse because the media all over the country, it's happening in Florida, Illinois, Wisconsin, Dallas, when blacks attack white people, the media will not call it out for what it is.
[01:18:13.659 --> 01:18:18.663]  And so the people doing it feel like it's okay.
[01:18:18.663 --> 01:18:21.245]  They feel like it's okay.
[01:18:21.245 --> 01:18:22.967]  They feel like that it's no big deal.
[01:18:24.444 --> 01:18:31.714]  And a lot of times the poor of the group too, they'll tell you it's poor whites that end up being in the Klan most of the time.
[01:18:31.714 --> 01:18:33.056]  It's the same thing with blacks.
[01:18:33.056 --> 01:18:35.018]  Poor blacks end up being in these gangs.
[01:18:35.018 --> 01:18:37.121]  The prisons, oh that's the other big issue.
[01:18:37.121 --> 01:18:38.483]  What do you think the prisons are?
[01:18:39.324 --> 01:18:42.086]  The government segregates everybody according to race.
[01:18:42.086 --> 01:18:43.186]  They say because they have to.
[01:18:43.186 --> 01:18:44.387]  And they pretty much do.
[01:18:44.387 --> 01:18:46.608]  Because that's just the way humans are.
[01:18:46.608 --> 01:18:47.909]  And then it gets worse and worse.
[01:18:47.909 --> 01:18:48.929]  The Aryan Nations.
[01:18:48.929 --> 01:18:51.811]  There's so few white people left in this country and in prison.
[01:18:51.811 --> 01:18:57.614]  The Aryan Nations now takes people who are black, Hispanic, Asian, whatever, as long as their mother is white.
[01:18:57.614 --> 01:19:00.076]  They're like following Jewish law or something.
[01:19:00.076 --> 01:19:01.897]  I mean, it's ridiculous.
[01:19:02.856 --> 01:19:04.658]  I've got family in East Texas, folks.
[01:19:04.658 --> 01:19:07.240]  There aren't any jobs left who are jail guards.
[01:19:07.240 --> 01:19:09.942]  And they will tell you they've turned the air conditioning off the last few years.
[01:19:09.942 --> 01:19:13.666]  People that lie and say prisons have got hot tubs and cable.
[01:19:13.666 --> 01:19:14.887]  Isn't true.
[01:19:14.887 --> 01:19:15.648]  Isn't true.
[01:19:15.648 --> 01:19:17.149]  They've turned the air conditioning off.
[01:19:17.149 --> 01:19:20.952]  You know, I was just talking to my dad who talked to my cousin the other day.
[01:19:20.952 --> 01:19:27.018]  It's like 115 degrees in the prison he works at right now and almost everybody's quitting.
[01:19:28.413 --> 01:19:31.777]  And it is just a hell pit of evil.
[01:19:31.777 --> 01:19:34.279]  We have the biggest prison population in the world.
[01:19:34.279 --> 01:19:35.801]  It's a college for this.
[01:19:35.801 --> 01:19:39.144]  And you send a white kid, a black kid, a Hispanic kid into prison?
[01:19:39.144 --> 01:19:42.007]  If they don't join the racial gangs, they're dead.
[01:19:42.904 --> 01:19:44.925]  So, why are the blacks running around?
[01:19:44.925 --> 01:19:48.908]  Because most of these blacks doing this have been in juvenile hall or prison.
[01:19:48.908 --> 01:19:50.729]  And that's what they know.
[01:19:50.729 --> 01:19:51.690]  That's why they're doing this.
[01:19:51.690 --> 01:19:53.251]  Does that make them any less dangerous?
[01:19:53.251 --> 01:19:53.711]  No.
[01:19:53.711 --> 01:19:55.833]  They're dangerous as you know what.
[01:19:55.833 --> 01:19:57.174]  And this country's gonna fall apart.
[01:19:57.174 --> 01:19:58.414]  It's been done by design.
[01:19:58.414 --> 01:19:59.175]  Your call's coming up.
[01:19:59.175 --> 01:19:59.975]  You want me to answer it?
[01:19:59.975 --> 01:20:00.316]  There it is.
[01:20:01.016 --> 01:20:03.538]  What would you do with a check for $25,000?
[01:20:03.538 --> 01:20:08.843]  What if you could eliminate all of your credit card debt in 90 days and keep all of your money?
[01:20:08.843 --> 01:20:19.112]  Hi, I'm Jason Davenport, and I've just completed ZeroDebt100.com, a program that stops and prevents debt collections of all kinds, including debt collectors and foreclosures, with guaranteed results.
[01:20:19.352 --> 01:20:20.654]  Forget loan modifications.
[01:20:20.654 --> 01:20:27.022]  Zero Debt showed me how to get the banks to pay my property taxes and insurance while stopping my foreclosure without paying one dime.
[01:20:27.022 --> 01:20:32.489]  An attorney tried to garnish my wages, but the court denied his request because of what I filed from the Zero Debt program.
[01:20:32.489 --> 01:20:35.113]  Find out how I did this by calling Zero Debt today at 800-477-9256.

[01:22:31.293 --> 01:22:35.856]  Have you ever wondered why banks, stockbrokers, investment advisors won't talk about gold IRAs?
[01:22:35.856 --> 01:22:41.660]  They've been available since 1986, yet the financial industry won't recognize the value of gold for your retirement.
[01:22:41.660 --> 01:22:45.302]  Gold has outperformed paper investments, yet no word about IRAs.

[01:24:19.094 --> 01:24:26.437]  By the way, while I'm on this gang stuff, I don't dislike the average police officer individually.
[01:24:26.437 --> 01:24:33.920]  Any more than I dislike a black person because there are racist black people that think it's their right to beat up white people because they're white.
[01:24:33.920 --> 01:24:34.740]  Or vice versa.
[01:24:36.127 --> 01:24:38.529]  But I saw this case a few weeks ago.
[01:24:38.529 --> 01:24:39.510]  We've shown the photo.
[01:24:39.510 --> 01:24:40.771]  We ought to dig it up.
[01:24:40.771 --> 01:24:42.812]  I was going to cover it again yesterday.
[01:24:42.812 --> 01:24:47.096]  Where the homeless guy hadn't done anything wrong and the witnesses all saw it.
[01:24:47.096 --> 01:24:51.660]  And they beat him for like five minutes and were doing knee drops on his head.
[01:24:51.660 --> 01:24:55.323]  And tasered him six times and then he died a day later.
[01:24:55.323 --> 01:24:57.705]  I mean just a completely bloody mass.
[01:24:57.705 --> 01:25:01.428]  And now police inside have leaked the fact that
[01:25:02.307 --> 01:25:15.597]  The police control system zoomed in on the street cam that's right above it that they won't release as entertainment while they were beating their gun butts into his head and blood was just splattering everywhere.
[01:25:15.597 --> 01:25:17.619]  That's a gang attack.
[01:25:17.619 --> 01:25:20.561]  I mean, look, you go around the wrong people, the wrong culture.
[01:25:20.561 --> 01:25:26.765]  They want to fight you and they're cowards and they want to do it when they got you outnumbered five to one.
[01:25:27.566 --> 01:25:37.092]  Whether it was rednecks, or whether it was illegal aliens, or whether it was black racists, or whether it's cops, it's the same thing.
[01:25:37.092 --> 01:25:41.955]  Now does that mean all the cops are like that, or all the white people are like that, or all the- No.
[01:25:41.955 --> 01:25:42.075]  No.
[01:25:44.525 --> 01:25:46.265]  But we do need to speak out against it.
[01:25:46.265 --> 01:25:54.667]  You know, my gosh, if a couple of white guys beat a gay guy up to death, it is like the end of the world.
[01:25:54.667 --> 01:25:56.547]  And it's wrong that that happens.
[01:25:56.547 --> 01:26:00.708]  It's like the end of the world and cause celeb.
[01:26:00.708 --> 01:26:03.589]  Because it's a protected group.
[01:26:03.589 --> 01:26:07.049]  You remember the case out in East Texas where they drugged the black guy to death?
[01:26:07.049 --> 01:26:08.550]  The two Aryan Nations people?
[01:26:08.550 --> 01:26:09.830]  By the way, they were given the death penalty.
[01:26:10.506 --> 01:26:16.649]  And the government tried to pass, using that, hate speech laws to restrict free speech.
[01:26:16.649 --> 01:26:18.229]  Remember that?
[01:26:18.229 --> 01:26:33.056]  And then, of course, it did not get reported that, well, it got reported, but not nationally, that that guy was the leader of the rival gang at the prison they'd been at for years.
[01:26:33.056 --> 01:26:38.718]  So really, it wasn't even, it was racial, but not in the classic racial, it was gang on gang.
[01:26:38.718 --> 01:26:39.759]  And then it turned out,
[01:26:40.996 --> 01:26:49.779]  A year after that, some black gangbangers pulled over a homeless white guy walking down the road who had never been in prison with them.
[01:26:49.779 --> 01:26:54.220]  And to get back Whitey, they drug him to death.
[01:26:54.220 --> 01:26:55.381]  And the media didn't even cover it.
[01:26:55.381 --> 01:26:57.041]  It was in the Associated Press and that was it.
[01:26:57.041 --> 01:26:58.822]  Just a little blurb.
[01:26:59.847 --> 01:27:07.992]  Now, again, what's worse, dragging a hobo you don't even know or dragging a rival gang person you're in a fight with to death?
[01:27:07.992 --> 01:27:09.993]  I think it's all as bad.
[01:27:09.993 --> 01:27:17.838]  But in jurisprudence, the fact that they knew him and had been in gang wars with his same gang.
[01:27:17.838 --> 01:27:19.579]  I mean, what do you expect to come out of these prisons?
[01:27:20.666 --> 01:27:23.327]  So it's terrible, but this is what we're creating.
[01:27:23.327 --> 01:27:25.168]  This is what America's becoming.
[01:27:25.168 --> 01:27:27.509]  That's what they're filling the military now with.
[01:27:27.509 --> 01:27:36.492]  I mean, they've even had CNBC specials, where entire units are certain gangs, and get in fights with each other over in Iraq.
[01:27:36.492 --> 01:27:43.975]  You got this black gang fighting this Hispanic gang, and this Hispanic gang fighting them, and this gang killing that gang.
[01:27:43.975 --> 01:27:45.175]  Humans are tribal.
[01:27:45.175 --> 01:27:47.456]  We are gang-oriented.
[01:27:47.456 --> 01:27:49.397]  And we better get a hold of this gang mentality.
[01:27:50.216 --> 01:27:51.897]  You know, I'm part of a gang.
[01:27:51.897 --> 01:28:01.583]  I believe in property rights, the right to defend yourself, the right to due process, the right to national sovereignty, the right to not have foreign banks come in and take us over and rule us.
[01:28:01.583 --> 01:28:04.885]  See, I'm part of the 1776 gang.
[01:28:04.885 --> 01:28:06.345]  And I don't care what color you are.
[01:28:06.345 --> 01:28:08.747]  I want to know what's in your heart, what's in your mind.
[01:28:08.747 --> 01:28:15.451]  I want to know if you burn for liberty and freedom, or if you are one of the chumps that wants to be part of one of these gangs.
[01:28:17.039 --> 01:28:18.942]  Are you part of a police motorcycle gang?
[01:28:18.942 --> 01:28:21.485]  Are you part of a general motorcycle gang?
[01:28:21.485 --> 01:28:31.839]  Look, I don't care as long as the gang you're in has values that are congruent with historical common sense and reality.
[01:28:31.839 --> 01:28:33.702]  In fact, gangs can be a good thing!
[01:28:35.845 --> 01:28:36.986]  What do you think the Tea Party is?
[01:28:36.986 --> 01:28:38.806]  It's why it scares the system so much.
[01:28:38.806 --> 01:28:41.407]  It's why they sent the Republicans in to take it over.
[01:28:41.407 --> 01:28:43.228]  But they haven't been totally successful.
[01:28:43.228 --> 01:28:51.292]  And so they're now coming out saying this gang is going to blow stuff up so they can use the military against that gang.
[01:28:51.292 --> 01:28:52.993]  So, yeah, I get gangs.
[01:28:52.993 --> 01:28:55.414]  I understand gangs.
[01:28:55.414 --> 01:28:58.095]  And, you know, here are the reports and we'll come back and go to your call.
[01:28:58.095 --> 01:29:00.496]  See, I asked a question and now I've spent two segments on it.
[01:29:01.627 --> 01:29:02.870]  Skerritt State Fair.
[01:29:02.870 --> 01:29:05.156]  This is out of NBC-TMJ4.
[01:29:07.990 --> 01:29:09.591]  Witnesses described mobs.
[01:29:09.591 --> 01:29:12.332]  Some people claim racially charged attacks.
[01:29:12.332 --> 01:29:16.254]  There's been video after video at the same fair.
[01:29:16.254 --> 01:29:17.574]  And you've all seen these.
[01:29:17.574 --> 01:29:19.836]  I mean, Drudge has got them up almost every day.
[01:29:19.836 --> 01:29:23.977]  Whole sections where there's... It's like... Here's another one.
[01:29:23.977 --> 01:29:28.980]  Mob of hundreds of black youths beat white people in racial attack.
[01:29:28.980 --> 01:29:30.921]  Police from three jurisdictions
[01:29:31.821 --> 01:29:35.104]  West Ellis, Milwaukee and Wisconsin State Fair.
[01:29:35.104 --> 01:29:46.272]  Police spent Friday night piecing together a series of incidents late Thursday night at the Wisconsin State Fair, in which groups of youths rampaged through the midway and outside the fairgrounds after closing.
[01:29:46.272 --> 01:29:48.093]  It goes through the attacks.
[01:29:48.093 --> 01:29:49.935]  We'll be right back, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:29:49.935 --> 01:29:50.715]  Your phone calls.
[01:29:50.715 --> 01:29:51.396]  Stay with us.
[01:29:51.396 --> 01:29:52.777]  We're on the march.
[01:29:52.777 --> 01:29:55.319]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:29:55.319 --> 01:29:57.981]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:30:02.079 --> 01:30:03.801]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones.
[01:30:03.801 --> 01:30:09.107]  I'm looking for people that have the wisdom to spot savings, opportunity, and recognize risk.
[01:30:09.107 --> 01:30:10.649]  Saving means to make money.
[01:30:10.649 --> 01:30:19.439]  The Cal Bend Pure Soap Company can save you thousands of dollars and give you good old-fashioned real soaps that are triple concentrated and twice as good as what you're using now.
[01:30:20.160 --> 01:30:27.684]  Soaps made from vegetable and coconut oils that contain no useless dyes, perfumes, deodorants, or antibacterials.
[01:30:27.684 --> 01:30:35.689]  Your risk is the hundreds of hazardous toxic detergents that give you rashes, itching sores, and deteriorating clothing called lint.
[01:30:35.689 --> 01:30:40.931]  If you want something better, if you want something you've never had before, you have to do something you've never done before.

[01:31:00.740 --> 01:31:01.902]  A very wealthy U.S.
[01:31:01.902 --> 01:31:08.851]  citizen is predicting that in 2011, we will witness the most important day in America in more than 50 years.
[01:31:08.851 --> 01:31:11.394]  He says it will change everything about our lives.
[01:31:11.394 --> 01:31:16.561]  The way you shop, travel, invest, educate your children, and even how you take care of your health and your own family.
[01:31:16.761 --> 01:31:19.802]  Now, this man has made some outrageous predictions over the years.
[01:31:19.802 --> 01:31:22.123]  The crazy part is, he's usually right.
[01:31:22.123 --> 01:31:28.386]  You see, he predicted the collapse of GM, Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and America's biggest mall owner, General Growth Properties.
[01:31:28.386 --> 01:31:31.747]  In fact, Barron's called his work a dire prophecy.
[01:31:31.747 --> 01:31:37.530]  Recently, he created a video, which you can watch online for free, detailing his biggest and most important prediction yet.
[01:31:37.530 --> 01:31:39.171]  And it's a real eye-opener.
[01:31:39.171 --> 01:31:40.471]  I can't stress this enough.
[01:31:40.471 --> 01:31:43.152]  You should at least watch this free video online today.
[01:31:43.152 --> 01:31:44.553]  He explains everything you need to know.
[01:31:44.833 --> 01:31:47.354]  Including simple steps you can take to protect yourself.
[01:31:47.354 --> 01:31:51.975]  You can find the video at www.EndOfAmerica3.com.
[01:31:51.975 --> 01:31:54.576]  That's End of America, the number 3.com.

[01:32:00.778 --> 01:32:04.101]  Congratulations to our friends at eFoodsDirect.com.
[01:32:04.101 --> 01:32:08.724]  In August, they celebrate 30 years in the long-term storable food business.
[01:32:08.724 --> 01:32:16.190]  To celebrate, eFoodsDirect.com is offering the lowest price ever on their one-year Freedom Food Supply, even less than the price in 1981.
[01:32:16.190 --> 01:32:17.451]  For a limited time, you get 30% off
[01:32:19.753 --> 01:32:20.354]  I think so.
[01:32:37.737 --> 01:32:38.298]  I think so.
[01:33:07.466 --> 01:33:09.167]  We're gonna raise this.
[01:33:30.496 --> 01:33:33.978]  News with Bob Chapman when he comes in at the start of the next hour.
[01:33:33.978 --> 01:33:42.264]  Italian prosecutors probing ratings agency Moody's and S&P after consumer groups complain they raided the offices.
[01:33:42.264 --> 01:33:46.086]  Now, Tarpley told us about this, I don't know, three weeks ago.
[01:33:46.086 --> 01:33:53.451]  And I don't know if this is new because even though this is in a whole bunch of mainstream newspapers, they don't really give details.
[01:33:54.986 --> 01:34:00.747]  But obviously they're asking why is Moody's and S&P downgrading Italy but not downgrading the U.S.
[01:34:00.747 --> 01:34:02.388]  when according to a lot of metrics the U.S.
[01:34:02.388 --> 01:34:04.788]  is in worse financial shape than Europe.
[01:34:04.788 --> 01:34:07.809]  So we're going to be going over that.
[01:34:07.809 --> 01:34:16.731]  Obviously the big news Russian envoy to NATO says NATO is planning attacks on Syria and Iran because they're trying to get Russia to go along with it.
[01:34:18.087 --> 01:34:19.688]  And what did Mark Faubert said?
[01:34:19.688 --> 01:34:22.169]  He said, this imploding economy, they're going to launch a new war.
[01:34:22.169 --> 01:34:23.330]  Yeah, no kidding.
[01:34:23.330 --> 01:34:26.992]  They've got our troops deployed over there ready for it.
[01:34:26.992 --> 01:34:31.895]  And they're not going to probably have to stage terror attacks if they attack Iran.
[01:34:31.895 --> 01:34:33.836]  Iran's going to strike back.
[01:34:33.836 --> 01:34:36.257]  And they're going to use that to take our liberties.
[01:34:36.257 --> 01:34:40.019]  And then they'll probably stage something and claim Tea Party people are involved with Iran.
[01:34:40.019 --> 01:34:41.000]  That'll be the staged event.
[01:34:42.196 --> 01:34:44.017]  You can see all the preconditioning.
[01:34:44.017 --> 01:34:46.517]  I'm telling you, we're in grave danger!
[01:34:46.517 --> 01:34:47.918]  Danger, Will Robinson!
[01:34:47.918 --> 01:34:50.018]  Danger!
[01:34:50.018 --> 01:34:51.719]  Really, Robbie, where is the danger coming from?
[01:34:51.719 --> 01:34:54.380]  The District of Criminals!
[01:34:54.380 --> 01:34:55.160]  Doctor!
[01:34:55.160 --> 01:34:56.320]  What was the name of the family?
[01:34:56.320 --> 01:34:57.080]  Doctor whatever?
[01:34:57.080 --> 01:35:01.482]  I forget the name of the family, I've only seen that show like once.
[01:35:01.482 --> 01:35:02.282]  Uh, but um...
[01:35:05.597 --> 01:35:08.679]  Since I mentioned this, I thought I'd show it to you and then we'll go to your calls.
[01:35:08.679 --> 01:35:14.202]  Arctic tipping point may not be reached.
[01:35:14.202 --> 01:35:22.166]  And it's BBC News site to say current concerns over tipping point and the disappearance of sea ice may have been misplaced.
[01:35:22.166 --> 01:35:30.630]  Danish researchers analyzed ancient pieces of driftwood in North Greenland, which they say is an accurate way to measure the extent of ancient ice flows.
[01:35:31.590 --> 01:35:35.913]  Yeah, this is the stuff buried in swamp bogs and the rest of it, carbon dated.
[01:35:35.913 --> 01:35:46.342]  Writing in the Journal of Science, the team found that evidence that ice levels were about 50% lower 5,000 years ago than they are today.
[01:35:46.342 --> 01:35:48.603]  Now, let's just stop there.
[01:35:48.603 --> 01:35:51.746]  This is all 50-plus-year-old news.
[01:35:51.746 --> 01:35:55.909]  I mean, this has been duplicated that I know of hundreds of times, which probably means it's thousands.
[01:35:55.909 --> 01:35:56.850]  I don't know how many times.
[01:35:58.186 --> 01:36:12.438]  That they've done the peat bogs, they've done the ice cores, they've done the driftwood, they've done all sorts of extractions, they've dug up Ice Age man, 10,000 plus years, Bronze Age, 9,000, Iberium maxim, they know.
[01:36:13.755 --> 01:36:15.116]  Oh, by the way, I forgot to cover that.
[01:36:15.116 --> 01:36:20.258]  They found thousands of miles of tunnels from Turkey to England, even under the English Channel.
[01:36:20.258 --> 01:36:21.098]  Will you print me that?
[01:36:21.098 --> 01:36:22.058]  It's incredible.
[01:36:22.058 --> 01:36:23.759]  Man-made tunnels all over Europe.
[01:36:23.759 --> 01:36:26.020]  We have no idea about our real history.
[01:36:26.020 --> 01:36:27.000]  I'm just going to leave it at that.
[01:36:27.000 --> 01:36:32.722]  The discoveries, they found, what, 17 new pyramids hidden under the desert in Egypt?
[01:36:32.722 --> 01:36:36.284]  I mean, we don't know what's going on.
[01:36:36.284 --> 01:36:38.725]  Just because they tell you what history is, we don't know.
[01:36:38.725 --> 01:36:40.825]  And people say, well, then it's this.
[01:36:40.825 --> 01:36:41.926]  No, I don't know.
[01:36:43.137 --> 01:36:47.580]  People ask me, and my answer is, I don't know!
[01:36:47.580 --> 01:36:49.701]  I don't know!
[01:36:49.701 --> 01:36:53.863]  You know that song?
[01:36:53.863 --> 01:37:03.089]  All I know is you've got to believe in foolish miracles.
[01:37:03.089 --> 01:37:04.390]  It's not how you, uh...
[01:37:06.155 --> 01:37:08.457]  Well, side issue, I'm now digressing here.
[01:37:08.457 --> 01:37:09.959]  I said I'd go to your calls, didn't I?
[01:37:09.959 --> 01:37:12.802]  Arctic Tipping Point, so you've got that piece of news here.
[01:37:12.802 --> 01:37:15.744]  They've always known this.
[01:37:15.744 --> 01:37:16.685]  They've always...
[01:37:17.941 --> 01:37:19.642]  Known this stuff in modern history.
[01:37:19.642 --> 01:37:21.163]  They've understood it.
[01:37:21.163 --> 01:37:22.364]  Okay?
[01:37:22.364 --> 01:37:23.085]  Yeah, there it is.
[01:37:23.085 --> 01:37:25.566]  Experts baffled by mysterious underground chambers.
[01:37:25.566 --> 01:37:26.967]  No, no, this is Daily Mail.
[01:37:26.967 --> 01:37:28.008]  That's Der Spiegel.
[01:37:28.008 --> 01:37:33.452]  The Daily Mail's got the huge photos and all the super powerful stuff in it.
[01:37:33.452 --> 01:37:33.912]  Thank you, though.
[01:37:33.912 --> 01:37:34.332]  Great job.
[01:37:34.332 --> 01:37:37.174]  You guys are getting better and better at finding that stuff faster than I can.
[01:37:37.174 --> 01:37:39.156]  Okay.
[01:37:39.156 --> 01:37:40.737]  Can I just make a coherent point here?
[01:37:41.778 --> 01:37:43.259]  Why do I say this isn't new news?
[01:37:43.259 --> 01:37:57.585]  Well, they've got the ice cores, they've had the peat bog data, they know also from the flows of the glacial rock deposits, the alluvial deposits, they know what's going on.
[01:37:57.585 --> 01:38:02.667]  And they know from the text that have been found.
[01:38:04.721 --> 01:38:06.162]  What's been happening?
[01:38:06.162 --> 01:38:07.603]  But I go back to this.
[01:38:07.603 --> 01:38:09.965]  Why suddenly are you hearing him go?
[01:38:09.965 --> 01:38:12.967]  Actually, the sun's controlling the temperature of the earth.
[01:38:12.967 --> 01:38:15.749]  Actually, cosmic radiation is forming the clouds.
[01:38:15.749 --> 01:38:20.352]  Actually, carbon dioxide goes up after the heat goes up.
[01:38:20.552 --> 01:38:23.855]  They knew that decades ago in all the major ice core studies.
[01:38:23.855 --> 01:38:33.302]  And people exposed Al Gore, what, three years ago, and pulled it out of the British schools, his video when he put the carbon dioxide first and temperature rise after.
[01:38:33.302 --> 01:38:34.843]  He just flipped the graphs.
[01:38:34.843 --> 01:38:37.244]  I mean, very simple scam.
[01:38:37.244 --> 01:38:39.686]  Why wouldn't anybody report this?
[01:38:39.686 --> 01:38:42.448]  Because you would be beat over the head if you did.
[01:38:42.448 --> 01:38:46.892]  But now legions of scientists are coming out with their findings that were already available.
[01:38:47.702 --> 01:38:49.383]  It's just now they've imploded.
[01:38:49.383 --> 01:38:53.146]  69% Rasmussen poll say it's a fraud.
[01:38:53.146 --> 01:38:55.587]  They're being lied to.
[01:38:55.587 --> 01:38:58.229]  That's what's happening.
[01:38:58.229 --> 01:39:02.852]  And I see these reports all the time now because polar bear numbers have doubled the last 10 years.
[01:39:02.852 --> 01:39:04.493]  They're up five-fold since the 1950s.
[01:39:04.493 --> 01:39:06.255]  You can pull those numbers up.
[01:39:07.666 --> 01:39:10.067]  James Dillingpole, the Telegraph, corrected me last week.
[01:39:10.067 --> 01:39:11.627]  I said, well, there's a double fold in the last 50.
[01:39:11.627 --> 01:39:14.128]  He goes, no, no, no, that's the last 10 years.
[01:39:14.128 --> 01:39:15.588]  It's five times.
[01:39:15.588 --> 01:39:16.509]  And I went and looked it up.
[01:39:16.509 --> 01:39:17.349]  Oh, wow.
[01:39:17.349 --> 01:39:22.670]  So, again, worse than I said, worse than I was saying.
[01:39:22.670 --> 01:39:25.231]  And by worse is, these things are overrunning everywhere.
[01:39:25.231 --> 01:39:27.732]  Polar Bear Kills British Boy in Arctic.
[01:39:29.195 --> 01:39:36.359]  And see, humans would always hunt polar bears so that they knew who was boss and would not come into town and start eating our kids.
[01:39:36.359 --> 01:39:40.442]  But now you don't hunt pumas, you don't hunt wolves, you don't hunt grizzlies.
[01:39:40.442 --> 01:39:43.123]  And we heard about a grizzly killing somebody last week.
[01:39:43.123 --> 01:39:44.985]  It's dinner time!
[01:39:44.985 --> 01:39:46.425]  Oh, these people run from us?
[01:39:46.425 --> 01:39:47.786]  These people don't hunt us?
[01:39:47.786 --> 01:39:48.527]  Well, we eat them then!
[01:39:49.187 --> 01:39:53.430]  And they love getting your head and crunching the top off and slurping those brains out.
[01:39:53.430 --> 01:40:02.456]  A polar bear has mauled a 17-year-old British boy to death in the Arctic and injured four other UK tourists.
[01:40:02.456 --> 01:40:07.079]  Oh, were you trying to keep him from drowning there?
[01:40:07.079 --> 01:40:08.059]  Friendly bear there?
[01:40:08.059 --> 01:40:11.582]  When a grizzly sees a polar bear, runs the other direction.
[01:40:13.060 --> 01:40:28.363]  And Horatio Chappell was one of 13, that's so sad, mainly ages 16 and 23 on British school exploring society trip near the glacier of the Norwegian island of Svalbard.
[01:40:28.363 --> 01:40:30.163]  Time to kill them!
[01:40:30.163 --> 01:40:32.864]  Time to kill some polar bears!
[01:40:32.864 --> 01:40:35.424]  And you notice last time I checked they may have killed it now.
[01:40:35.424 --> 01:40:39.165]  They decided not to kill the grizzly that attacked and killed the man and tried to kill the woman.
[01:40:40.057 --> 01:40:42.638]  Okay, well, they're going to start eating us.
[01:40:42.638 --> 01:40:45.960]  I mean, if you don't act like a predator, you become prey.
[01:40:45.960 --> 01:40:49.821]  You look like a can of pork and beans on the shelf to one of these things.
[01:40:49.821 --> 01:40:52.442]  Okay, let me check the stocks and then I'll go to your calls here.
[01:40:52.442 --> 01:40:56.944]  I haven't even gotten any of the news yet here today.
[01:40:56.944 --> 01:41:02.326]  I feel great, but TJIF, it's Friday, as they like to say.
[01:41:05.069 --> 01:41:05.369]  It's up 64 points.
[01:41:25.575 --> 01:41:26.836]  I don't want it to go down.
[01:41:26.836 --> 01:41:29.558]  These idiots send me emails and go, oh, but all implodes.
[01:41:29.558 --> 01:41:31.059]  I don't care if the stock market dies.
[01:41:31.059 --> 01:41:33.021]  I don't have any money in the stock market.
[01:41:33.021 --> 01:41:44.870]  The companies most of us work for, Ted isn't a public company and I'm not involved in his company, so I have my own company, but most people and most companies I do business with are publicly traded.
[01:41:44.870 --> 01:41:49.214]  And that's where they get a lot of their money and fund new operations.
[01:41:49.214 --> 01:41:51.896]  And so yeah, the stock market tanks, we're in deep trouble.
[01:41:53.632 --> 01:41:54.412]  Hey, how's it going?
[01:42:18.251 --> 01:42:20.812]  Hey, yeah, Tanner again from Texas.
[01:42:20.812 --> 01:42:29.034]  I'm pretty sure you remember me the other day talking about how they set the video from Bloomberg private on the $3.3 trillion in backdoor bailouts.
[01:42:29.034 --> 01:42:32.215]  Um, yes, but you can find those news articles.
[01:42:32.215 --> 01:42:34.056]  You can!
[01:42:34.056 --> 01:42:40.838]  Anyway, look, I got it set back public, but my point is this, and I'm not going to try to draw these conclusions myself, but I wanted to get your opinion on it.
[01:42:41.793 --> 01:42:53.355]  I have proven in my YouTube channel where I uploaded these videos and that let's talk politics, no apostrophe, and instead of C-S it's an X. And for anybody who questions what I'm saying here, please go and see for yourself.
[01:42:53.355 --> 01:42:54.976]  No, there is YouTube censorship.
[01:42:54.976 --> 01:42:56.436]  Yes, sir, please.
[01:42:56.436 --> 01:42:58.116]  Okay, look.
[01:42:58.116 --> 01:43:03.497]  On the 11th, I sent an email where you could legibly read this report.
[01:43:03.497 --> 01:43:07.598]  You could see that it was being censored, because I favorited the video, so therefore you could see why.
[01:43:07.598 --> 01:43:08.098]  I understand.
[01:43:08.098 --> 01:43:09.779]  This is our second time talking about it.
[01:43:09.779 --> 01:43:10.639]  What's going on with it?
[01:43:11.417 --> 01:43:13.703]  Okay, on the 11th is when I sent out the email.
[01:43:13.703 --> 01:43:16.249]  I proved that in my channel.
[01:43:16.249 --> 01:43:20.560]  That was the exact same day the view count issues began having problems on YouTube.
[01:43:20.956 --> 01:43:25.937]  And they ended on the 8th, which was ending the two-day window gap.
[01:43:25.937 --> 01:43:35.539]  It could have possibly ended up in the most viewed videos of the day, so therefore make it go more viral, which I uploaded... You're thinking YouTube... No, I'm not saying that.
[01:43:35.539 --> 01:43:41.181]  I'm saying... Well, sir, they would have just deleted it for copyright infringement, but I hear you, and I appreciate your call.
[01:43:41.181 --> 01:43:45.361]  Do you have any comments about all the stuff that's happening?
[01:43:45.361 --> 01:43:45.822]  No, no.
[01:43:45.822 --> 01:43:47.602]  Oh, on the... Are you talking about the gangsters?
[01:43:50.946 --> 01:43:53.227]  Well, let me tell you like this.
[01:43:53.227 --> 01:44:01.193]  Liberty is the only term in the Declaration of Independence that has an objective definition, and that definition is without restraint.
[01:44:01.193 --> 01:44:03.975]  And we are a republic, which means we're bound to that document.
[01:44:03.975 --> 01:44:07.377]  Therefore, nobody has the actual authority to enforce your sobriety.
[01:44:08.135 --> 01:44:23.403]  Uh, therefore, uh, you know, the fact that it's increased drug use, increased homicide, I mean, we got a million people in privately owned prisons, over a million people in privately owned prisons, or the war on drugs, um, you know, and it's created this whole culture of gang activity and corruption.
[01:44:23.763 --> 01:44:24.583]  No, it has.
[01:44:24.583 --> 01:44:24.883]  I know.
[01:44:24.883 --> 01:44:29.505]  I'm so sick of people trying to dress like gangsters just everywhere.
[01:44:29.505 --> 01:44:31.986]  Every race, every color, every religion.
[01:44:31.986 --> 01:44:33.347]  And it's so pathetic.
[01:44:33.347 --> 01:44:35.168]  And they're so wimpy.
[01:44:35.168 --> 01:44:38.489]  And it's just the dirtiest thing you can imagine.
[01:44:38.489 --> 01:44:39.689]  And it's all been designed.
[01:44:39.689 --> 01:44:41.950]  I mean, these are colleges of corruption.
[01:44:41.950 --> 01:44:43.111]  Tanner, I appreciate your call.
[01:44:44.471 --> 01:44:53.855]  By the way, I have a Fox Business article talking about media matters, and there are petitions that have been entered in to have them investigated for their tax-free exemption.
[01:44:53.855 --> 01:45:05.641]  They're not supposed to be involved in politics, but they brag that they take their orders from the White House and, quote, want to criminally infiltrate news organizations from within and destroy them.
[01:45:05.641 --> 01:45:10.643]  So, just another disgusting example of what's going on out there.
[01:45:11.343 --> 01:45:12.824]  Okay, let's continue with calls.
[01:45:12.824 --> 01:45:13.985]  Dustery in Michigan.
[01:45:13.985 --> 01:45:14.606]  You're on the air.
[01:45:14.606 --> 01:45:15.927]  Go ahead.
[01:45:15.927 --> 01:45:17.948]  Hey, thank you, Alex.
[01:45:17.948 --> 01:45:25.935]  I'm bringing the Republic back to Michigan, and I'm bringing in a common law system to weed out the Admiralty laws.
[01:45:25.935 --> 01:45:33.200]  And I'm looking for anybody and everybody in Michigan, in every county, who wants to help by bringing in common law courts.
[01:45:33.200 --> 01:45:40.306]  I've got MichiganCommonLaw.com, and I've got documents up there to get rid of your artificial person,
[01:45:41.724 --> 01:45:48.396]  And by doing this, it helps cut the funding to Congress because you're no longer susceptible to their laws.
[01:45:48.973 --> 01:45:59.840]  You know, I've seen a lot of this out there, and I haven't looked at your information, but a lot of it is really patriot mythology, because the system's totally criminal.
[01:45:59.840 --> 01:46:03.122]  I mean, they don't care if it's illegal for the TSA to grab your genitals.
[01:46:03.122 --> 01:46:04.383]  They do it.
[01:46:04.383 --> 01:46:06.905]  They don't care if it's illegal for the President to launch a war in Libya.
[01:46:06.905 --> 01:46:07.966]  They do it.
[01:46:07.966 --> 01:46:11.428]  They don't care if it's illegal for the CIA to ship in cocaine to the U.S.
[01:46:11.428 --> 01:46:15.731]  Just got caught running major drug cartel, El Paso Times, federal court documents.
[01:46:15.731 --> 01:46:16.992]  They just do it.
[01:46:16.992 --> 01:46:18.193]  And I've seen people
[01:46:19.113 --> 01:46:27.498]  That break away, stop paying all the taxes, and a lot of times you just get left alone because the government's all bluff, just like the illegal aliens.
[01:46:27.498 --> 01:46:36.403]  You know, I mean, just change your name to an illegal alien's name, and suddenly the cops will leave you alone, you'll be God, no driver's license needed, no taxes.
[01:46:36.403 --> 01:46:39.925]  If you do get arrested, they just say you don't speak English, they let you go.
[01:46:39.925 --> 01:46:43.587]  So I think some people have success with some of this Patriot stuff,
[01:46:45.627 --> 01:46:51.848]  And then kind of get left alone because the system counts on us to comply with all their garbage.
[01:46:51.848 --> 01:46:52.748]  And it is admiralty.
[01:46:52.748 --> 01:46:54.589]  I've read that in federal court rulings.
[01:46:54.589 --> 01:46:56.729]  They are taking property without due process.
[01:46:56.729 --> 01:46:59.410]  The courts are taking it criminally.
[01:46:59.410 --> 01:47:00.770]  The banks are doing it.
[01:47:00.770 --> 01:47:07.251]  So I'm not saying you individually, and I appreciate your call, are wrong.
[01:47:07.251 --> 01:47:08.991]  I've been doing this 16 years.
[01:47:08.991 --> 01:47:11.232]  And I've been really awake for 18.
[01:47:11.232 --> 01:47:12.832]  And I've been through it.
[01:47:12.832 --> 01:47:13.192]  A lot.
[01:47:13.972 --> 01:47:23.017]  And I see a lot of people, you know, file liens on the police or whatever, and it just ends up getting you sent to prison.
[01:47:23.017 --> 01:47:27.639]  Now, as for common law courts, our juries are supposed to be common law courts.
[01:47:27.639 --> 01:47:32.622]  Our grand juries are supposed to wear the pants and not be bossed around by the prosecutor.
[01:47:32.622 --> 01:47:34.563]  Juries are not supposed to be bossed around by the judge.
[01:47:34.563 --> 01:47:36.404]  They're supposed to instruct the judge and ask questions.
[01:47:37.981 --> 01:47:42.123]  So again, it's all a culture of cowering to government that has to end.
[01:47:42.123 --> 01:47:43.544]  It's very complex.
[01:47:43.544 --> 01:47:55.651]  I don't get into those areas a lot because, in fact, I know there's remedies to the mortgage fraud, but I pretty much don't even have guests on about that because how can you 100% know they're going to help people properly?
[01:47:55.651 --> 01:47:56.231]  You know what I mean?
[01:47:56.231 --> 01:47:57.132]  It's just I don't like
[01:47:58.735 --> 01:48:02.457]  I don't even like giving financial advice, so I say what I would do financially.
[01:48:02.457 --> 01:48:04.619]  You know, I mean, it's just really sticky stuff.
[01:48:04.619 --> 01:48:06.040]  I appreciate your call.
[01:48:06.040 --> 01:48:07.160]  Sheldon in Wisconsin.
[01:48:07.160 --> 01:48:07.721]  You're on the air.
[01:48:07.721 --> 01:48:08.121]  Go ahead.
[01:48:08.121 --> 01:48:10.322]  Hey, good afternoon.
[01:48:10.322 --> 01:48:11.223]  Alex, how are you doing?
[01:48:11.223 --> 01:48:11.843]  Good.
[01:48:11.843 --> 01:48:12.564]  Welcome.
[01:48:12.564 --> 01:48:13.124]  All right.
[01:48:13.124 --> 01:48:19.288]  I woke up to you about three years ago, so I'm proud to say you're my brother, even though I'm a black man from Milwaukee, Wisconsin.
[01:48:19.288 --> 01:48:20.589]  Thanks for the shout out today.
[01:48:20.589 --> 01:48:23.411]  God bless you as well, sir.
[01:48:23.411 --> 01:48:24.792]  But please continue.
[01:48:25.626 --> 01:48:26.246]  No, no, go.
[01:48:26.246 --> 01:48:28.348]  I have three quick points to make.
[01:48:28.348 --> 01:48:34.992]  Why the public is intrigued with the death telling, that's treasonous.
[01:48:34.992 --> 01:48:45.820]  Why don't we talk about, or can you enlighten the public on something that we should be impeaching the president over, like the murder of Donald Young or his birth certificate?
[01:48:45.820 --> 01:48:51.844]  Or why is he using a social security number from a white guy 100-some years old from Connecticut?
[01:48:52.424 --> 01:48:54.647]  That's my first point.
[01:48:54.647 --> 01:48:55.928]  I'm a GCN listener.
[01:48:55.928 --> 01:49:01.755]  I listen to your co-worker, Dr. Deagle, who speaks very highly of you and Ron Paul.
[01:49:01.755 --> 01:49:03.797]  I would like to see him on your show.
[01:49:03.797 --> 01:49:06.861]  But he had a subject on regarding the Thumbback Fascination.
[01:49:07.421 --> 01:49:10.223]  Which is used to take the God gene out of a human being.
[01:49:10.223 --> 01:49:25.075]  I don't know if you've ever heard of that, or... Well, I know governments admit they're trying to develop drugs that quote, target the spirit part of the brain, you know, the part that is associated with lighting up under CAT scans during spiritual experiences.
[01:49:25.075 --> 01:49:29.659]  I know that they're coming up with a whole class of vaccines that aren't really vaccines, they're mutagenic.
[01:49:30.800 --> 01:49:31.300]  From Vax.
[01:49:31.300 --> 01:49:31.721]  F-U-N-V-A-X
[01:49:58.763 --> 01:50:00.686]  Did you say Flynn-Vac?
[01:50:00.686 --> 01:50:01.687]  No, Fun.
[01:50:01.687 --> 01:50:03.350]  Have you guys been having fun?
[01:50:03.350 --> 01:50:04.071]  Okay, got it.
[01:50:04.071 --> 01:50:05.513]  Fun-Vac.
[01:50:05.513 --> 01:50:05.813]  Right.
[01:50:05.813 --> 01:50:10.139]  And the White House just released a report maybe like two or three weeks ago.
[01:50:10.139 --> 01:50:12.823]  I don't know if you've heard of Dr. Deagle?
[01:50:12.823 --> 01:50:13.464]  Of course I have.
[01:50:14.272 --> 01:50:16.534]  Yes, he's a great guy.
[01:50:16.534 --> 01:50:19.257]  He speaks very highly of you and Ron Paul.
[01:50:19.257 --> 01:50:21.519]  So I would like to see him on the show one day.
[01:50:21.519 --> 01:50:23.240]  Just a suggestion.
[01:50:23.240 --> 01:50:27.984]  And my last point is I want to touch the gangster part of mentality.
[01:50:27.984 --> 01:50:28.525]  Sure.
[01:50:28.525 --> 01:50:31.347]  I've been listening to your show for quite some time and
[01:50:32.188 --> 01:50:35.890]  I have to admit that I fell in love with your show.
[01:50:35.890 --> 01:50:38.311]  I try to get my friends to listen to your show.
[01:50:38.311 --> 01:50:39.872]  Some are on board, some are not.
[01:50:39.872 --> 01:50:41.913]  So, my question is to you.
[01:50:41.913 --> 01:50:47.636]  How do I get the black people out of the democratic state of mind to vote for Ron Paul?
[01:50:47.636 --> 01:50:50.578]  They say that there's no challenger to President Bush.
[01:50:50.578 --> 01:50:53.659]  They have Romney and Perry, who are illegal immigrants.
[01:50:53.659 --> 01:50:58.662]  I believe those guys are Mexican, especially Romney, who's an inbred.

[01:52:01.983 --> 01:52:06.687]  Alex Jones here with vital information concerning our nation's fragile food supply.
[01:52:06.687 --> 01:52:13.112]  Folks, there are some truly dangerous trends forming, and I think it's important for my listeners to do three things right away.
[01:52:13.112 --> 01:52:15.394]  Number one, study the past.
[01:52:15.394 --> 01:52:17.796]  History really does repeat itself.
[01:52:17.796 --> 01:52:21.519]  Number two, learn to spot the dangerous food shortage trends.
[01:52:22.631 --> 01:52:25.713]  Number three, take decisive action.
[01:52:25.713 --> 01:52:29.575]  A perfect storm is brewing, or a global food crisis.
[01:52:29.575 --> 01:52:38.620]  That's why I'm telling everyone to read the new book, Rising Prices, Empty Shelves, warning signs that trigger the deadliest famines in history.
[01:52:38.620 --> 01:52:42.042]  Don't get caught unprepared when the crisis hits.
[01:52:42.042 --> 01:52:45.665]  This book is only available at risingpricesemptyshelves.com.
[01:52:46.525 --> 01:52:51.451]  You'll also get a free copy of Supermarket Survival, How to Cut Your Grocery Bills in Half.
[01:52:51.451 --> 01:52:56.077]  Again, that website is risingpricesemptyshelves.com.
[01:52:56.077 --> 01:52:58.761]  That's risingpricesemptyshelves.com.
[01:53:00.771 --> 01:53:06.095]  We don't need to convince you that the threat of forced entry is on the rise and that your door locks are inadequate.
[01:53:06.095 --> 01:53:10.438]  Now you can virtually eliminate the threat of your door being kicked in with the Door Sentinel.
[01:53:10.438 --> 01:53:17.083]  The Door Sentinel offers stand-alone door kick-in protection for under $67 and installs in minutes on any door.
[01:53:17.083 --> 01:53:19.465]  Turn your home or apartment into a fortress.

[01:53:23.608 --> 01:53:25.350]  The Door Sentinel, always on guard for you.
[01:53:29.833 --> 01:53:31.094]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[01:53:31.094 --> 01:53:35.657]  Have you ever wondered why banks, stockbrokers, investment advisors won't talk about gold IRAs?
[01:53:35.657 --> 01:53:41.461]  They've been available since 1986, yet the financial industry won't recognize the value of gold for your retirement.
[01:53:41.461 --> 01:53:45.103]  Gold has outperformed paper investments, yet no word about IRAs.
[01:53:45.103 --> 01:53:47.825]  If you would like to have gold for your retirement, call 800-686-2237.
[01:53:47.825 --> 01:53:52.889]  Don't get left behind by rising inflation and low returns.
[01:53:52.889 --> 01:53:53.129]  Call 800-686-2237.
[01:53:53.129 --> 01:53:54.530]  Secure your future and call 1-800-686-2237.
[01:54:11.700 --> 01:54:14.522]  Okay, Bob Chapman and Dr. Paul Craig Roberts are coming back.
[01:54:14.522 --> 01:54:18.384]  I actually don't have time to go back to the last caller because I've just got to get to some of these other people.
[01:54:18.384 --> 01:54:19.745]  In fact, who's up next here, John?
[01:54:22.802 --> 01:54:33.853]  I want to get to Mike, Mark, Pauline, Alan, at least before Bob Chapman joins us, and then Dr. Roberts to get into the economy in the last 30 minutes with both gentlemen riding shotgun with us.
[01:54:33.853 --> 01:54:43.022]  But to answer the last caller's question, I guess it was Sheldon in Wisconsin, he was bringing up gang stuff, people fighting, you know, and racial gangs.
[01:54:45.902 --> 01:54:49.123]  And he was also asking, how do you reach out to black folks?
[01:54:49.123 --> 01:54:49.563]  You know what?
[01:54:49.563 --> 01:54:50.544]  I don't worry about it.
[01:54:50.544 --> 01:54:55.946]  I don't try to target young people or black people or old people or rich people or poor people.
[01:54:55.946 --> 01:54:58.607]  I just cover the facts and that's the way it is.
[01:54:58.607 --> 01:55:00.547]  And I don't care what people think about me.
[01:55:00.547 --> 01:55:02.728]  And I never did that to just be confident.
[01:55:08.450 --> 01:55:15.713]  I never did that to try to garner support, but I found that it actually did have that effect.
[01:55:15.713 --> 01:55:17.553]  So you've just got to be confident.
[01:55:17.553 --> 01:55:19.574]  But a lot of people don't see themselves as leaders.
[01:55:19.574 --> 01:55:22.575]  They don't see themselves as being involved in society.
[01:55:22.575 --> 01:55:29.217]  They just are kind of passive and go work and get a paycheck and then think about what they want to do that's fun and what TV shows they want to watch.
[01:55:29.217 --> 01:55:30.938]  They don't see themselves as part of the world.
[01:55:31.878 --> 01:55:33.700]  But mainly just folks that dress up.
[01:55:33.700 --> 01:55:35.982]  I mean, that's what all this fronting is about.
[01:55:35.982 --> 01:55:37.403]  The yuppies do it.
[01:55:37.403 --> 01:55:38.764]  Everybody does it.
[01:55:38.764 --> 01:55:39.705]  With their bling.
[01:55:39.705 --> 01:55:44.869]  I mean, if I wanted a fancy car, it would be because it drove fast and was reliable.
[01:55:44.869 --> 01:55:51.474]  But then I wouldn't have a really fancy car because I don't want folks looking at it and wanting it.
[01:55:51.474 --> 01:55:53.116]  And I don't want to make people feel bad.
[01:55:53.116 --> 01:55:54.036]  You know what I mean?
[01:55:54.036 --> 01:55:57.739]  Like, I don't want bling.
[01:55:57.739 --> 01:55:59.361]  But other people, they do want bling.
[01:56:00.981 --> 01:56:06.266]  And that's across the board, because it's about the bling, it's not about the person.
[01:56:06.266 --> 01:56:07.567]  I mean, I'm just marveling.
[01:56:09.488 --> 01:56:12.170]  Yesterday, ants got in my car somehow.
[01:56:12.170 --> 01:56:15.552]  I went out to the car, right at sunset, and there were ants.
[01:56:15.552 --> 01:56:16.813]  And I just thought they were so neat.
[01:56:16.813 --> 01:56:21.217]  Little bitty sugar ants that I've sometimes never seen with long antennas running around in my car.
[01:56:21.217 --> 01:56:22.277]  I thought they were just so cool.
[01:56:22.277 --> 01:56:25.279]  I mean, I'm not into diamond necklaces and stuff.
[01:56:25.279 --> 01:56:25.880]  I'm sorry.
[01:56:25.880 --> 01:56:30.864]  I mean, and the moon, you know, was up and I was...
[01:56:31.664 --> 01:56:36.705]  Looking at it and it was just, even though it was like 108 degrees outside, I was like, this is really cool!
[01:56:36.705 --> 01:56:38.765]  It's like the Earth is burning up!
[01:56:38.765 --> 01:56:39.565]  Al Gore's right!
[01:56:39.565 --> 01:56:43.306]  I mean, there's just so much interesting stuff.
[01:56:43.306 --> 01:56:45.227]  Everything's interesting.
[01:56:45.227 --> 01:56:50.327]  I've had a migraine headache before and it was so painful, I'm like, this is actually kind of interesting.
[01:56:50.327 --> 01:56:53.148]  But I guess I'm crazy, you know, I'm different.
[01:56:53.148 --> 01:56:57.069]  Let's go ahead and let's talk to Mike in Illinois.
[01:56:57.069 --> 01:56:58.029]  Mike, you're on the air.
[01:56:58.029 --> 01:56:58.369]  Welcome.
[01:57:00.259 --> 01:57:02.701]  You know, I've been wanting to tell you about this forever.
[01:57:02.701 --> 01:57:21.440]  There are a myriad of things I could talk to you about, but, you know, in two books, in two passages in the Bible, in Joshua and 2 Samuel, they talk about Jasher, and Jasher talks about half men, half bears, and it's Jasher 32,
[01:57:24.207 --> 01:57:37.330]  Yeah, the Bible is full of chimeras and big floating spaceships and guys with blue helmets on, making them take things that make them hallucinate and splicing men with animals.
[01:57:37.330 --> 01:57:45.732]  The entire Old Testament has got more green men running around in it than Coast to Coast AM.
[01:57:45.732 --> 01:57:48.312]  501c3 churches will never tell you about it.
[01:57:48.312 --> 01:57:51.393]  That's why we have to infiltrate it, the real Christians.
[01:57:51.738 --> 01:57:59.083]  Well, look, I just don't even go there because, because, I mean, I can't get people to understand the sun is what mainly heats the earth.
[01:57:59.083 --> 01:58:01.344]  I mean, they think that's a conspiracy theory.
[01:58:01.344 --> 01:58:02.345]  Well, it was a majority.
[01:58:02.345 --> 01:58:03.505]  Now the majority know it.
[01:58:03.505 --> 01:58:04.006]  It's true.
[01:58:04.006 --> 01:58:04.906]  I know it's extreme.
[01:58:04.906 --> 01:58:06.527]  The sun heats the earth.
[01:58:06.527 --> 01:58:13.652]  So, I mean, you know, trying to get into the fact that this is a Jewish history of what they really believe was going on, and it sounds like
[01:58:14.492 --> 01:58:16.454]  It sounds like War of the Worlds or something.
[01:58:16.454 --> 01:58:28.603]  I mean, if folks hadn't read Ezekiel and all that stuff, it's definitely like a Kurt Vonnegut science fiction book.
[01:58:28.603 --> 01:58:29.564]  Absolutely, Mike.
[01:58:29.564 --> 01:58:30.204]  You're awesome.
[01:58:30.204 --> 01:58:33.987]  Hey, send me some more of those passages from the Bible.
[01:58:33.987 --> 01:58:38.571]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, we'll be right back with our number three, Mark, Paula, Alan.
[01:58:38.571 --> 01:58:39.411]  We'll get to all of you.
[01:58:39.411 --> 01:58:39.872]  Stay with us.
[01:58:42.694 --> 01:58:46.220]  You are listening to GCN.

[01:58:52.426 --> 01:58:56.427]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[01:58:56.427 --> 01:58:59.688]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[01:58:59.688 --> 01:59:04.489]  As we're finishing off this agenda, they'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[01:59:04.489 --> 01:59:10.871]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[01:59:10.871 --> 01:59:13.112]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us
[01:59:13.652 --> 01:59:13.952]  Tim Geithner?
[01:59:13.952 --> 01:59:14.473]  Bernanke?
[01:59:14.473 --> 01:59:15.253]  They're arsonists!
[01:59:15.253 --> 01:59:16.234]  They're asking for more matches!
[01:59:16.234 --> 01:59:18.655]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[01:59:32.543 --> 01:59:34.685]  Today seems like nobody does care.
[01:59:34.685 --> 01:59:39.829]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the republic.
[01:59:39.829 --> 01:59:54.122]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.

[02:00:05.916 --> 02:00:10.763]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[02:00:10.763 --> 02:00:12.345]  You want answers?
[02:00:12.345 --> 02:00:13.887]  Well, so does he.
[02:00:13.887 --> 02:00:18.073]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:18.073 --> 02:00:22.158]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:23.992 --> 02:00:27.695]  Mark, Paula, Al and Tim, we're going to get to all of you in this hour.
[02:00:27.695 --> 02:00:32.960]  Dr. Paul Craig Roberts shines us at the bottom of the hour, running shotgun with Bob Chapman.
[02:00:32.960 --> 02:00:35.942]  Bob will be with us coming up in the next segment as he is every Friday.
[02:00:35.942 --> 02:00:45.070]  And boy, what a great time to have him on with all the incredible volatility, the debt ceiling, the super congress, the Russian envoy saying NATO's getting ready to attack.
[02:00:46.031 --> 02:00:47.051]  Iran and Syria.
[02:00:47.051 --> 02:00:49.732]  I mean, this is off to the races.
[02:00:49.732 --> 02:00:51.853]  It's all coming up in the next segment.
[02:00:51.853 --> 02:00:54.334]  But right now, Mark in Oregon, you're on the air.
[02:00:54.334 --> 02:00:55.994]  Welcome.
[02:00:55.994 --> 02:00:57.255]  Good morning, Alex.
[02:00:57.255 --> 02:00:58.475]  Hey, buddy.
[02:00:58.475 --> 02:01:02.176]  Hey, I'll tell you, I know it's afternoon where you're at this morning where I'm at, they tell me.
[02:01:02.176 --> 02:01:03.537]  So, great day to you.
[02:01:04.326 --> 02:01:12.612]  Alex, in recent times you've been mentioning that you're setting up a social networking website as well as... Yeah, we can launch it now.
[02:01:12.612 --> 02:01:15.895]  We can launch it now, but then I've got to launch the TV show on time.
[02:01:15.895 --> 02:01:21.459]  And then I'm about to announce it for beta testing for folks that want to come sign up and then they can beta test it.
[02:01:21.459 --> 02:01:25.782]  And I'm always busy keeping the other sites up, but yes, it's coming soon.
[02:01:25.782 --> 02:01:33.608]  Yes, and I was wondering if you, when you get time, if you can now or later, any day,
[02:01:34.449 --> 02:01:34.970]  I don't know.
[02:01:45.220 --> 02:01:58.705]  Social networking has great potential in itself to actually organize people to become visible to the mass media news, as it's referred to, the lesser news, and rather break into it.
[02:01:58.705 --> 02:02:14.471]  You know, my bailiwick has always been publicity when it comes to solutions, and I see it as a great publicity vehicle as well as the organization of people to actually get together and get out into the street for causes of liberty.
[02:02:15.111 --> 02:02:20.277]  Well, I agree with you and the problem is we built two different social networks.
[02:02:20.277 --> 02:02:27.646]  One we launched and then it got all screwed up because so many members were on it and it just didn't work well.
[02:02:27.646 --> 02:02:30.369]  We did another one and then it didn't do well under load testing.
[02:02:30.369 --> 02:02:31.591]  The problem is it's going to be big.
[02:02:34.218 --> 02:02:37.924]  I'm always having limited personnel and always trying to finish things.
[02:02:37.924 --> 02:02:41.188]  And then once something gets behind, it gets behind forever.
[02:02:41.188 --> 02:02:45.815]  But I tell you what, after the break, as we go to Bob, I'll tell you about my plan briefly for both of those.
[02:02:45.815 --> 02:02:47.398]  Good to hear from you, Mark.
[02:02:47.398 --> 02:02:49.080]  Paula in Missouri, you're on the air.
[02:02:49.080 --> 02:02:49.401]  Welcome.
[02:02:51.206 --> 02:02:52.786]  Good afternoon, Alex.
[02:02:52.786 --> 02:02:53.747]  Hey!
[02:02:53.747 --> 02:02:58.648]  I'm a first-time caller and I want to thank you for what you do.
[02:02:58.648 --> 02:03:08.971]  And I did get a aqua rain water filter and I've been off fluoride for a year and a half and most of my arthritis symptoms are gone.
[02:03:08.971 --> 02:03:10.951]  So, I thank you very much.
[02:03:10.951 --> 02:03:12.712]  Well, that's what the medical doctors say.
[02:03:12.712 --> 02:03:14.532]  They say that the fact that the U.S.
[02:03:14.532 --> 02:03:17.213]  has record arthritis, one of the biggest contributors
[02:03:18.354 --> 02:03:25.242]  Is the sodium fluoride in the water because in all the studies they admit it calcifies out in the joints.
[02:03:25.242 --> 02:03:36.256]  But the doctors don't want to tell you that because well they're not taught that and they have to research it themselves and they like to make money off of treating the degenerative condition rather than curing it.
[02:03:37.594 --> 02:03:43.939]  And then I had a rheumatologist wanting me to go to pain management for just OxyContin.
[02:03:43.939 --> 02:03:46.841]  And I said, take my name out of your database.
[02:03:46.841 --> 02:03:48.161]  I have nothing to do with you.
[02:03:48.161 --> 02:03:51.044]  But listen, this isn't placebo though.
[02:03:51.044 --> 02:03:57.428]  You're saying that your arthritis got a lot better when you got off fluoride.
[02:03:57.428 --> 02:04:01.491]  Yeah, I was tickled pink, let me tell you.
[02:04:01.491 --> 02:04:06.554]  But the fibromyalgia that I have is still a problem, but I had emailed
[02:04:08.345 --> 02:04:08.625]  Uh-huh.
[02:04:22.492 --> 02:04:25.236]  That they cannot... I don't have it in front of me.
[02:04:25.236 --> 02:04:25.876]  No, no, no, ma'am.
[02:04:25.876 --> 02:04:27.579]  That was always taught.
[02:04:27.579 --> 02:04:31.704]  And now they just lie and say, treaties supersede the Constitution.
[02:04:31.704 --> 02:04:34.507]  And the president can launch wars without congressional approval.
[02:04:34.507 --> 02:04:36.530]  And we can have a super congress run things.
[02:04:36.530 --> 02:04:38.673]  And the TSA can stick their hands down your pants.
[02:04:39.193 --> 02:04:41.295]  Now, but listen, send that to me again.
[02:04:41.295 --> 02:04:49.921]  Send it to showtipsandinfowars.com because, you know, I've actually read that a lot of places in historical documents and textbooks on the Constitution.
[02:04:49.921 --> 02:04:53.584]  I've been sent a lot of them over the years and that's another issue we should point out.
[02:04:53.584 --> 02:04:58.628]  Again, they brazenly lie to you from a fake authoritative position.
[02:04:58.628 --> 02:05:00.069]  They say, this is the way it is.
[02:05:00.069 --> 02:05:01.210]  The sun doesn't heat the earth.
[02:05:02.335 --> 02:05:04.056]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones.
[02:05:04.056 --> 02:05:09.361]  I'm looking for people that have the wisdom to spot savings, opportunity, and recognize risk.
[02:05:09.361 --> 02:05:10.902]  Saving means to make money.
[02:05:10.902 --> 02:05:19.690]  The Calbin Pure Soap Company can save you thousands of dollars and give you good old-fashioned real soaps that are triple concentrated and twice as good as what you're using now.
[02:05:20.410 --> 02:05:27.952]  Soaps made from vegetable and coconut oils that contain no useless dyes, perfumes, deodorants, or antibacterials.
[02:05:27.952 --> 02:05:35.955]  Your risk is the hundreds of hazardous toxic detergents that give you rashes, itching sores, and deteriorating clothing called lint.
[02:05:35.955 --> 02:05:41.176]  If you want something better, if you want something you've never had before, you have to do something you've never done before.
[02:05:41.176 --> 02:05:43.317]  Getting a free catalog is easy by calling 800
[02:05:44.859 --> 02:05:49.345]  Call 800-340-7091 or see Calvin on the web at FiveStarSoap.com.
[02:05:49.345 --> 02:05:53.852]  Take charge of your health now by calling 800-340-7091 or see Calvin on the web at FiveStarSoap.com.
[02:06:00.814 --> 02:06:05.357]  This is Alex Jones with 5 good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[02:06:05.357 --> 02:06:06.278]  Number 1.
[02:06:06.278 --> 02:06:09.701]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[02:06:09.701 --> 02:06:10.561]  Number 2.
[02:06:10.561 --> 02:06:15.445]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[02:06:15.445 --> 02:06:16.185]  It's true.
[02:06:16.185 --> 02:06:21.069]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[02:06:21.069 --> 02:06:21.890]  Number 3.
[02:06:21.890 --> 02:06:25.472]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[02:06:25.472 --> 02:06:29.175]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[02:06:29.375 --> 02:06:30.175]  Number four.
[02:06:30.175 --> 02:06:32.936]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[02:06:32.936 --> 02:06:36.617]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[02:06:36.617 --> 02:06:37.397]  Number five.
[02:06:37.397 --> 02:06:41.538]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[02:06:41.538 --> 02:06:46.600]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[02:06:46.600 --> 02:06:50.781]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[02:06:50.781 --> 02:06:52.562]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[02:06:52.562 --> 02:06:57.163]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun, so go to mysolarbackup.com, or call 1-866-422-9000.
[02:06:57.483 --> 02:07:01.105]  877-327-0365.
[02:07:01.105 --> 02:07:07.768]  When you're out on the road, the last place you want to be is on the road.
[02:07:07.768 --> 02:07:12.911]  But if the unfortunate happens, you'll be glad you were wearing diamond gussets.
[02:07:12.911 --> 02:07:21.636]  There's a place down in Tennessee, where they make blue diamond gusset jeans.
[02:07:21.636 --> 02:07:23.637]  They sew pride in every stitch.
[02:07:25.755 --> 02:07:27.949]  I guarantee you'll love the way they fit.
[02:07:30.134 --> 02:07:34.717]  They put a Diamond Gusset in the crotch where you need it most.
[02:07:34.717 --> 02:07:38.559]  Blue Diamond Gussets got it.
[02:07:38.559 --> 02:07:39.779]  Others don't.
[02:07:39.779 --> 02:07:41.940]  We turn jeans inside out.
[02:07:41.940 --> 02:07:43.721]  Diamond Gusset Jeans.
[02:07:43.721 --> 02:07:46.603]  Made in the USA with unparalleled quality.
[02:07:46.603 --> 02:07:50.825]  Our Defender Motorcycle Jeans combine Gusset comfort with Kevlar protection.
[02:07:50.825 --> 02:07:53.227]  So you can ride all day with confidence.
[02:07:53.227 --> 02:07:55.928]  Order yours at gusset.com.
[02:07:55.928 --> 02:07:58.309]  Diamond Gusset Jeans got it.
[02:07:58.309 --> 02:07:59.170]  Others don't.
[02:08:02.253 --> 02:08:05.037]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[02:08:05.037 --> 02:08:07.841]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:08:28.672 --> 02:08:34.797]  Okay, Bob Chapman with us for the rest of the hour, and also riding shotgun the last 25 minutes.
[02:08:34.797 --> 02:08:37.720]  Dr. Paul Craig Roberts, former head of policy in the U.S.
[02:08:37.720 --> 02:08:40.762]  Treasury Department, former Wall Street Journal editor.
[02:08:40.762 --> 02:08:55.675]  Bob Chapman, of course, 50 years in the trenches, publishing the Gary Allen Report, and of course, None Dare Call a Conspiracy, biggest private silver and gold broker for decades, lived all over the world, always a great expert to have on.
[02:08:56.155 --> 02:09:09.002]  And I need to cover the waterfront with him on a basic summation of the debt ceiling, the Super Congress, what we're seeing inside the stock market, where gold is going, and also some of your calls interspersed.
[02:09:09.002 --> 02:09:10.463]  We've got to move quick here.
[02:09:10.463 --> 02:09:12.404]  Also, the war news.
[02:09:12.404 --> 02:09:16.506]  There is so much here that I want to discuss with our guests.
[02:09:16.506 --> 02:09:25.171]  But first, the last caller, or two callers ago, Mark in Oregon, was asking, what is your plan with the TV show?
[02:09:25.171 --> 02:09:25.291]  OK.
[02:09:26.494 --> 02:09:40.207]  Just like Glenn Beck has his new subscriber TV show, I've had a subscriber radio slash TV show for eight years, with my films and the books and everything at PrisonPlanet.TV.
[02:09:40.207 --> 02:09:42.930]  The TV show launches September 1st, 7 p.m.
[02:09:42.930 --> 02:09:44.791]  Central, 30 minutes long.
[02:09:44.791 --> 02:09:50.237]  There'll also be at least once a week, hour or two hour long, InfoWars special reports.
[02:09:51.841 --> 02:10:11.237]  And those will be at PrisonPlanet.tv, because that's what pays for the graphics, the video people, the camera people, the researchers, all of this, because I see comments on InfoWars and Prison Planet when we'll post, hey, we just had a Gerald Cilente on last night, you know, to cover what's happening in the markets.
[02:10:11.237 --> 02:10:18.223]  And then we had Mike Adams in here about the raids on people selling papayas and watermelons and raw cheese.
[02:10:20.251 --> 02:10:22.333]  And then, of course, I cover government drug dealing.
[02:10:22.333 --> 02:10:25.416]  It's like an hour-long special report, and they're, like, complaining going on.
[02:10:25.416 --> 02:10:26.897]  This should be free!
[02:10:26.897 --> 02:10:29.839]  Give it to me right now, you scum!
[02:10:29.839 --> 02:10:33.543]  Meanwhile, while they were saying that this morning, it was free.
[02:10:33.543 --> 02:10:36.125]  It was free over at the Alex Jones Channel at YouTube.
[02:10:38.092 --> 02:10:40.173]  You're right, I'm a bad businessman.
[02:10:40.173 --> 02:10:42.053]  My goal is to get the word out.
[02:10:42.053 --> 02:10:45.174]  PrisonPlanet.tv members, you just underwrite us.
[02:10:45.174 --> 02:10:46.354]  It's really a donation.
[02:10:46.354 --> 02:10:50.635]  You get it first, you get it live, you get it in higher quality, you get it all in one spot.
[02:10:50.635 --> 02:10:55.657]  And we are just going to leave PrisonPlanet.tv sometime this year or next year.
[02:10:55.657 --> 02:10:59.278]  It's going to stay there, but we're going to build a whole new site and a whole new platform.
[02:11:00.359 --> 02:11:01.379]  That's going to have even more.
[02:11:01.379 --> 02:11:03.280]  And you notice we've added a lot to prisonplanet.tv.
[02:11:03.280 --> 02:11:04.280]  It's a great site.
[02:11:04.280 --> 02:11:06.521]  So you'll just get one membership and you'll have both.
[02:11:06.521 --> 02:11:09.302]  It's going to be a whole new news system.
[02:11:09.302 --> 02:11:10.142]  But it doesn't matter.
[02:11:10.142 --> 02:11:11.303]  I'm not procrastinating.
[02:11:11.303 --> 02:11:15.864]  I've been planning this nightly TV show for five years and never doing it.
[02:11:15.864 --> 02:11:22.526]  Because I had to move over here, get bigger, spend a year building that studio, then you're busy doing all your other work.
[02:11:22.526 --> 02:11:25.107]  And so we're burning the midnight oil up here.
[02:11:25.107 --> 02:11:27.188]  The guys were here again until midnight.
[02:11:28.654 --> 02:11:32.158]  Um, last week they were here two nights past midnight.
[02:11:32.158 --> 02:11:34.500]  I've only been staying up here until 9 or 10.
[02:11:34.500 --> 02:11:37.563]  I went home at like 6.30 yesterday.
[02:11:37.563 --> 02:11:39.845]  So, the point is, we're working hard.
[02:11:39.845 --> 02:11:46.151]  And now the InfoWars special reports you're seeing are even a different studio.
[02:11:46.151 --> 02:11:49.314]  Those are in a roundtable format versus the news program.
[02:11:49.314 --> 02:11:50.396]  You haven't seen that yet.
[02:11:51.272 --> 02:11:59.954]  Right now you're just seeing special reports, and you'll notice we've done three of them in the last week and a half, and they're getting better and better, better graphics, better music, better information.
[02:11:59.954 --> 02:12:05.495]  I'm saying I'm very impressed with the crew, and I'd like to be able to give them raises as well.
[02:12:05.495 --> 02:12:08.296]  So I hope that you'll go to PrisonPlanet.tv and get a membership.
[02:12:08.296 --> 02:12:11.497]  You can download any of the special reports, burn them to disk, get them out to whoever you want.
[02:12:12.372 --> 02:12:15.593]  And I know it's evil that we charge for it so we can finance it.
[02:12:15.593 --> 02:12:21.416]  We should just, I should be like a wizard with a top hat on and go, abracadabra-ba-goomba!
[02:12:21.416 --> 02:12:31.820]  And then it's like a Cloud City forms with pink dragons flying around and, you know, and Pinkie Pie the winged My Little Pony could be there too.
[02:12:31.820 --> 02:12:34.622]  And Skittles would fall from the sky and we would eat candy.
[02:12:36.082 --> 02:12:36.683]  Carebears.
[02:12:36.683 --> 02:12:38.424]  It's just everything.
[02:12:38.424 --> 02:12:47.550]  But anyways, we have the online video bookstores, the great new InfoWars camo ball caps in, the Liberty or Death shirts that are really hot.
[02:12:47.550 --> 02:12:51.973]  When you purchase, when you buy the books and videos, that's what supports this radio broadcast.
[02:12:52.153 --> 02:12:52.553]  We're good to go.
[02:13:13.874 --> 02:13:14.915]  A decade ago.
[02:13:14.915 --> 02:13:16.517]  Glenn Beck says tomorrow is Network Today.
[02:13:16.517 --> 02:13:19.460]  We are the Glenn Beck Network a decade ago.
[02:13:19.460 --> 02:13:22.302]  And he understands that's the future and that's great.
[02:13:22.302 --> 02:13:26.667]  So that's what we're doing here and we're beating him to the punch because that's free market.
[02:13:26.667 --> 02:13:29.169]  We're into winning here in the info war.
[02:13:29.169 --> 02:13:31.111]  So PrisonPlanet.tv, 15 cents a day, $5.95 a month.
[02:13:33.934 --> 02:13:38.578]  I get a yearly membership, get three months free, and we're just adding more and more and more and more and more.
[02:13:38.578 --> 02:13:41.800]  Okay, now going to Bob Chapman.
[02:13:41.800 --> 02:13:46.563]  Bob Chapman, great to have you here at TheInternationalForecaster.com.
[02:13:46.563 --> 02:13:47.704]  So much is going on.
[02:13:47.704 --> 02:13:53.609]  A, before I forget, what do you think of the Super Congress?
[02:13:53.609 --> 02:13:56.831]  Is it a new form of government, as many people are saying?
[02:13:56.831 --> 02:14:02.015]  And B, then let's get into the debt limit and where we're going here.
[02:14:04.349 --> 02:14:07.471]  Well, I think it's unconstitutional.
[02:14:07.471 --> 02:14:08.691]  And we'll see.
[02:14:08.691 --> 02:14:15.555]  I'm not a constitutionalist attorney, but from what I know and from what I see, that's what I think it is.
[02:14:15.555 --> 02:14:21.739]  And why would Congress want to sit virtually mute
[02:14:22.535 --> 02:14:27.036]  Until they decide what these twelve people decide what they're going to do.
[02:14:27.036 --> 02:14:35.417]  Anybody who voted against the bill is automatically disqualified by being one of the twelve.
[02:14:35.417 --> 02:14:40.518]  And the twelve are going to make legislation.
[02:14:40.518 --> 02:14:47.320]  And it's sort of like a Star Chamber proceeding perhaps or a Soviet Politburo.
[02:14:50.817 --> 02:15:04.305]  Is it going to spread to other things other than just solving this debt crisis and austerity and cutting back on spending or perhaps including tax increases?
[02:15:04.305 --> 02:15:05.826]  We don't know yet.
[02:15:05.826 --> 02:15:08.608]  And will they get involved in other legislation?
[02:15:08.608 --> 02:15:09.328]  Probably.
[02:15:09.328 --> 02:15:16.933]  Well Harry Reid says they will and spending bills affect everything so do cutting bills but I mean getting back
[02:15:17.273 --> 02:15:19.214]  The end of the filibuster in the Senate.
[02:15:19.214 --> 02:15:20.334]  The end of amendments.
[02:15:20.334 --> 02:15:24.036]  I mean, the bills are supposed to come from individual members of the House.
[02:15:24.036 --> 02:15:25.437]  This is completely backwards.
[02:15:25.437 --> 02:15:28.158]  A 12-member committee with the President as the 13th.
[02:15:28.158 --> 02:15:31.459]  And you pointed out a point that I saw on the news and never even covered.
[02:15:31.459 --> 02:15:32.820]  It's worse than I said.
[02:15:32.820 --> 02:15:33.420]  That's right.
[02:15:33.420 --> 02:15:43.824]  They, in Reuters, they reported that they have told, also Politico, that if you voted against this now, you can't be part of the super committee or even discuss things with the committee.
[02:15:43.824 --> 02:15:44.745]  So they're now saying
[02:15:45.305 --> 02:15:51.110]  That you're elected by your district, and your district that elected you has no say.
[02:15:51.110 --> 02:15:57.156]  This is a new form of government, and it's absolutely unconstitutional.
[02:15:57.156 --> 02:16:03.522]  I mean, the Constitution says that the bills start in the House, spending bills especially.
[02:16:03.522 --> 02:16:05.784]  They don't start in some star chamber, Bob, as you know.
[02:16:07.776 --> 02:16:09.057]  That's right.
[02:16:09.057 --> 02:16:23.474]  And so I think this is a move toward eventual dictatorial government as well, down the road, giving the President great power in working with these 12 individuals who were appointed.
[02:16:25.709 --> 02:16:35.597]  As far as what they're going to do in relation to cuts and the costs of government remains to be seen.
[02:16:35.597 --> 02:16:48.187]  As we discussed before, the setting up of this committee was one of the three things they wanted to do behind the scenes, so to speak, until it became known.
[02:16:48.187 --> 02:16:53.952]  And the other was to cut Social Security and Medicare in whatever way that they could.
[02:16:54.962 --> 02:17:02.265]  So that they could get what they want done and channel the money into the areas that they want it shown to.
[02:17:02.265 --> 02:17:22.914]  I mean, if you cut back on Social Security and Medicare, and let's say it's a million dollars, and is half of that savings going to go to enlarge the military-industrial complex, or is it going to
[02:17:23.559 --> 02:17:25.921]  Well, you're right, Bob.
[02:17:48.334 --> 02:18:00.768]  And looking at this, seeing what's happened to the economy, as Ron Paul has said, as you've said, as Dr. Roberts has said, as the CHICOM said, I hate agreeing with them, we're already defaulted, debating whether it goes up or down.
[02:18:00.768 --> 02:18:03.350]  We're dead if we up the debt limit, we're dead if we don't.
[02:18:04.232 --> 02:18:12.082]  Because we're not debating the thousand plus trillion in derivatives that we've been signed on to.
[02:18:12.082 --> 02:18:16.408]  So why did the stock market, why is it going crazy the last 48 hours?
[02:18:16.408 --> 02:18:18.912]  A and B, is the plunge protection team involved?
[02:18:20.626 --> 02:18:28.153]  Well, first of all, they're not involved in Longside or haven't been up until perhaps an hour ago.
[02:18:28.153 --> 02:18:29.435]  They let the market go down.
[02:18:29.435 --> 02:18:30.456]  They could have stopped it.
[02:18:30.456 --> 02:18:32.558]  They have the power to do that.
[02:18:32.558 --> 02:18:34.319]  And so they wanted the market down.
[02:18:34.319 --> 02:18:36.221]  We'll find out a little bit later why.
[02:18:38.403 --> 02:18:41.406]  If you notice the patent, the market went down.
[02:18:41.406 --> 02:18:45.570]  It continued this morning down a couple hundred more points.
[02:18:45.570 --> 02:18:48.052]  Now it's up 90 points.
[02:18:48.052 --> 02:18:53.177]  They continue to attack silver and gold, particularly silver, which is a much thinner market.
[02:18:54.077 --> 02:18:54.417]  Why?
[02:18:54.417 --> 02:19:01.099]  Because JPM and HSBC are short silver, and they were getting their heads handed to them again.
[02:19:01.099 --> 02:19:09.540]  More manipulation by government, or the people who control government and the Fed, which is JPM, GS, Citigroup, etc.
[02:19:09.540 --> 02:19:15.482]  And so, they really took the commodities apart yesterday, too.
[02:19:15.482 --> 02:19:20.243]  And they had oil down to around $85.
[02:19:23.300 --> 02:19:26.321]  And that doesn't normally happen.
[02:19:26.321 --> 02:19:30.342]  If oil moves, it usually moves a dollar or two or less.
[02:19:30.342 --> 02:19:33.163]  And so they were in the markets big time.
[02:19:33.163 --> 02:19:40.045]  They let the Dow go down, but they attacked commodities and gold and silver.
[02:19:40.045 --> 02:19:42.826]  And now they're back and they're trying to hold it up, at least temporarily.
[02:19:43.983 --> 02:19:45.565]  Ah, so an attack on gold and silver.
[02:19:45.565 --> 02:19:47.166]  Well, if it was, it didn't work long.
[02:19:47.166 --> 02:19:54.333]  Well, it knocked it down like 15 bucks and it's almost retraced its gains right there in the doldrums of summer.
[02:19:54.333 --> 02:20:00.359]  Now, I want to look at how they're trying to blame the Tea Party for this and what the Super Congress will do when we come back with Bob Chapman.
[02:20:01.872 --> 02:20:02.713]  Question.
[02:20:02.713 --> 02:20:07.297]  Can functional magnetic resonance imaging be used to read our minds?
[02:20:07.297 --> 02:20:13.002]  Author Jose Calazzo answers yes in his two new books, America's New Slavery.
[02:20:13.002 --> 02:20:23.631]  For more than 13 years, author Jose Calazzo has been trying to prove that the US government has the capacity to read a person's thoughts with a revolutionary technology
[02:20:23.931 --> 02:20:30.415]  Known as FMRI, Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging, and there is proof that it exists.
[02:20:30.415 --> 02:20:37.179]  America's New Slavery explores this technology and its many possible applications in national security.
[02:20:37.179 --> 02:20:38.779]  Who has access to it?
[02:20:38.779 --> 02:20:40.200]  How is it being used?
[02:20:40.200 --> 02:20:43.522]  Does America's salvation rest in this technology?
[02:20:43.522 --> 02:20:50.206]  These and many other questions are answered in America's New Slavery, the new books by Jose Collazo.
[02:20:50.626 --> 02:20:55.894]  Available on BN.com, Amazon.com, and Borders.com.
[02:20:55.894 --> 02:20:57.996]  America's New Slavery.
[02:20:57.996 --> 02:21:00.139]  All Americans should be concerned.
[02:21:02.329 --> 02:21:05.711]  Hi, I'm Mark Craighead, founder of Crossbreed Holsters.
[02:21:05.711 --> 02:21:13.895]  I designed our top-selling holster, the SuperTuck Deluxe, to solve the problems of being poked, pinched, and gouged while carrying concealed.

[02:21:30.683 --> 02:21:31.924]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[02:21:31.924 --> 02:21:36.487]  Have you ever wondered why banks, stock workers, investment advisors won't talk about gold IRAs?
[02:21:36.487 --> 02:21:42.291]  They've been available since 1986, yet the financial industry won't recognize the value of gold before your retirement.
[02:21:42.291 --> 02:21:45.933]  Gold has outperformed paper investments, yet no word about IRAs.
[02:21:45.933 --> 02:21:48.655]  If you would like to have gold for your retirement, call 800-686-2237.
[02:21:48.655 --> 02:21:53.718]  Don't get left behind by rising inflation and low returns.
[02:21:53.718 --> 02:21:54.019]  Call 800-686-2237.
[02:21:54.019 --> 02:21:55.360]  Secure your future and call 1-800-686-2237.
[02:22:00.803 --> 02:22:06.648]  There are limitless ways to go into business for yourself, but most involve substantial capital and risk.

[02:22:48.499 --> 02:22:51.401]  That's the initials MZ and Infowarsteam.com.
[02:22:51.401 --> 02:22:53.862]  That's MZ and Infowarsteam.com.
[02:22:53.862 --> 02:22:57.644]  I only promote products that I truly believe in, and these are phenomenal.
[02:22:57.644 --> 02:23:00.666]  Whatever you do, visit Infowarsteam.com.
[02:23:00.666 --> 02:23:04.168]  Attention gardeners, this is an urgent GCN self-reliance update.
[02:23:04.168 --> 02:23:07.690]  GCN has just discovered a new bioactive superfood for garden plants.
[02:23:07.810 --> 02:23:08.250]  I'm good to go!
[02:23:33.422 --> 02:23:33.782]  I think so.
[02:24:11.440 --> 02:24:18.605]  All right, Dr. Paul Craig Roberts is going to be riding shotgun with Bob and I for the rest of the full official broadcast.
[02:24:18.605 --> 02:24:29.572]  And I forgot during the break to ask Bob Chapman if he wants to stay 30 minutes into the next hour so we can get into more financial news, which will be presentplanet.tv and infowars.com audio streams only.
[02:24:29.572 --> 02:24:31.914]  So we'll just ask Bob now, as I forgot.
[02:24:31.914 --> 02:24:35.897]  Bob, you saddled up to go 30 minutes to the next hour, or you have prior agreements?
[02:24:36.972 --> 02:24:44.996]  No, I always leave time open for that and I told you guys in there when we were on the break that yes, I will be here.
[02:24:44.996 --> 02:24:45.436]  Okay, good.
[02:24:45.436 --> 02:24:47.337]  See, I even forget what I asked during the break.
[02:24:47.337 --> 02:24:50.419]  I was just going to ask you and I guess they heard me mumbling and I did ask.
[02:24:50.419 --> 02:24:52.540]  Good.
[02:24:52.540 --> 02:24:54.141]  Now, Bob, look.
[02:24:55.034 --> 02:24:56.134]  We've seen this.
[02:24:56.134 --> 02:25:08.298]  We see them rebranding now that the terror threat is mainly anti-globalist white people or folks that don't like the Federal Reserve gang raping them.
[02:25:08.298 --> 02:25:18.221]  And then now we saw the Vice President this week and a whole bunch of others in the New York Times and Politico say, yes, the Tea Party really are terrorists and they've got terrorist tactics and they're going to blow stuff up.
[02:25:18.601 --> 02:25:26.676]  And we have the White House memos and advisors, if you remember a year ago, publicly saying a terror attack would sure help you, Mr. President.
[02:25:26.676 --> 02:25:29.842]  And we've got the very suspicious situation.
[02:25:31.721 --> 02:25:36.024]  Over in Norway, all of that.
[02:25:36.024 --> 02:25:40.387]  And then I heard, oh, you've got to go ahead and let us raise your taxes on the debt limit.
[02:25:40.387 --> 02:25:45.290]  You know, the Tea Party is holding this up for no reason when it was really all about taxes.
[02:25:45.290 --> 02:25:47.451]  And then now I heard it yesterday and today.
[02:25:47.451 --> 02:25:48.652]  It's all over the news.
[02:25:48.652 --> 02:25:54.395]  Well, the market crashed because the Tea Party didn't let spending go up enough when spending does go way up.
[02:25:55.536 --> 02:25:57.337]  And oh my gosh, the Tea Party causes.
[02:25:57.337 --> 02:26:04.520]  So I see them putting the Star Chamber in place, the committee of 13, getting them in place there.
[02:26:04.520 --> 02:26:10.983]  And then as things get really bad, as you and others have predicted in the fall, that's right when their power will be in full swing.
[02:26:10.983 --> 02:26:16.346]  And now they're in control of new banker bailouts, new stimuluses, new systems.
[02:26:16.346 --> 02:26:19.787]  I think we're going to be in for absolute
[02:26:21.288 --> 02:26:23.769]  That's a good take on that and it's something that
[02:26:49.262 --> 02:27:11.274]  uh... has always disturbed me and that was offset not too long ago by Mr. Bernanke who admitted that the depression was caused by the lack of money and credit in the economy and they just froze everything up and brought it on and they've admitted that and that was the cause
[02:27:11.994 --> 02:27:13.455]  Not smooth hardly.
[02:27:13.455 --> 02:27:16.017]  Not tariffs.
[02:27:16.017 --> 02:27:19.939]  And even the tariffs that they put on were really minuscule.
[02:27:19.939 --> 02:27:22.041]  And then everybody else put their tariffs on.
[02:27:22.041 --> 02:27:25.723]  So it was like a tariff banquet.
[02:27:25.723 --> 02:27:31.727]  And if you put 4% on this, well, the country down the way put 4% on this also.
[02:27:31.727 --> 02:27:35.129]  And so much of it neutralized each other.
[02:27:35.129 --> 02:27:37.971]  And so you're absolutely right.
[02:27:37.971 --> 02:27:39.292]  Another instance of
[02:27:40.032 --> 02:27:46.438]  Blaming something on something else that had very little if nothing to do with what happened.
[02:27:46.438 --> 02:27:54.885]  And the control that they have of the media is really astounding.
[02:27:54.885 --> 02:27:58.308]  Everything they want brought on in great amounts.
[02:27:59.068 --> 02:28:06.274]  And you were referring to the Tea Party group or movement, and that's what they were doing.
[02:28:06.274 --> 02:28:10.277]  They have to have somebody to blame for what they were doing.
[02:28:10.277 --> 02:28:16.561]  And so we have to counter that by telling the people, no, that isn't the way it happened.
[02:28:16.561 --> 02:28:17.842]  This is the way it happened.
[02:28:17.842 --> 02:28:19.484]  This is what they wanted to do.
[02:28:19.484 --> 02:28:20.644]  Exactly.
[02:28:20.644 --> 02:28:22.366]  It's not the Federal Reserve that did this.
[02:28:22.366 --> 02:28:26.349]  It's not the $27 trillion in banker bailouts that did all of this.
[02:28:29.458 --> 02:28:36.525]  It's not globalism or the derivatives or any of it.
[02:28:36.525 --> 02:28:44.572]  No, it's now all of us who want to not increase taxes and want to cut spending and want to get our house back in order.
[02:28:44.572 --> 02:28:46.114]  It's all our fault, Bob.
[02:28:46.114 --> 02:28:46.995]  We did all this.
[02:28:49.474 --> 02:28:52.156]  From their point of view, you're absolutely right.
[02:28:52.156 --> 02:28:54.317]  And they will continue to do that.
[02:28:54.317 --> 02:28:57.800]  And we have to fight fire with fire, truth with truth.
[02:28:57.800 --> 02:28:59.881]  And that's what we're going to do.
[02:28:59.881 --> 02:29:03.704]  And believe me, we're getting heard all over the world.
[02:29:03.704 --> 02:29:07.747]  I did five foreign interviews in the last six or seven days.
[02:29:07.747 --> 02:29:11.670]  And I don't call them, they call me or they email me.
[02:29:11.670 --> 02:29:19.135]  And so there's a great thirst for the truth all over the world, everywhere.
[02:29:20.110 --> 02:29:24.091]  And I think it's wonderful and you in particular and others.
[02:29:27.166 --> 02:29:34.610]  Well, it's asinine that the establishment media has been wrong on everything.
[02:29:34.610 --> 02:29:36.031]  Not because they're dumb.
[02:29:36.031 --> 02:29:37.852]  Because they're misleading people.
[02:29:37.852 --> 02:29:40.094]  We've been incredibly accurate.
[02:29:40.094 --> 02:29:45.797]  And then they turn around and try to blame those of us who are actually addressing the real problem.
[02:29:45.797 --> 02:29:46.998]  But that's classic.
[02:29:46.998 --> 02:29:49.860]  Just like they're gonna stage terror attacks and blame it on us as well.
[02:29:49.860 --> 02:29:50.801]  And this is what's coming.
[02:29:50.801 --> 02:29:51.301]  We'll be right back.
[02:29:51.681 --> 02:29:54.667]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[02:29:54.667 --> 02:29:58.274]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:05.515 --> 02:30:06.756]  Tyranny is here.
[02:30:06.756 --> 02:30:10.699]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[02:30:10.699 --> 02:30:12.941]  It really says that the state is God.
[02:30:12.941 --> 02:30:18.805]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on Earth.
[02:30:18.805 --> 02:30:25.050]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps, now being expanded nationwide.
[02:30:25.450 --> 02:30:31.415]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful shadow state.
[02:30:31.415 --> 02:30:35.618]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depth to which our republic has fallen.
[02:30:35.618 --> 02:30:39.901]  Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship.
[02:30:39.901 --> 02:30:45.865]  Body scanners, sound cannons, citizen spies, stage terror, and cameras on every street corner.
[02:30:45.865 --> 02:30:49.408]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[02:30:49.408 --> 02:30:51.389]  The police state isn't coming.
[02:30:51.389 --> 02:30:51.830]  It's here.

[02:32:00.980 --> 02:32:02.162]  A very wealthy U.S.
[02:32:02.162 --> 02:32:09.089]  citizen is predicting that in 2011, we will witness the most important day in America in more than 50 years.
[02:32:09.089 --> 02:32:11.651]  He says it will change everything about our lives.
[02:32:11.651 --> 02:32:16.817]  The way you shop, travel, invest, educate your children, and even how you take care of your health and your own family.
[02:32:17.017 --> 02:32:20.059]  Now, this man has made some outrageous predictions over the years.
[02:32:20.059 --> 02:32:22.380]  The crazy part is, he's usually right.
[02:32:22.380 --> 02:32:28.624]  You see, he predicted the collapse of GM, Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and America's biggest mall owner, General Growth Properties.
[02:32:28.624 --> 02:32:32.006]  In fact, Barron's called his work a dire prophecy.
[02:32:32.006 --> 02:32:37.790]  Recently, he created a video, which you can watch online for free, detailing his biggest and most important prediction yet.
[02:32:37.790 --> 02:32:39.431]  And it's a real eye-opener.
[02:32:39.431 --> 02:32:40.731]  I can't stress this enough.
[02:32:40.731 --> 02:32:43.413]  You should at least watch this free video online today.
[02:32:43.413 --> 02:32:44.834]  He explains everything you need to know.
[02:32:45.094 --> 02:32:47.617]  Including simple steps you can take to protect yourself.
[02:32:47.617 --> 02:32:52.241]  You can find the video at www.EndOfAmerica3.com.
[02:32:52.241 --> 02:32:54.823]  That's End of America, the number 3.com.
[02:32:54.823 --> 02:32:58.707]  Watch the free video at www.EndOfAmerica3.com.
[02:32:58.707 --> 02:32:59.708]  That's EndOfAmerica3.com.
[02:33:11.809 --> 02:33:12.790]  Okay, here's the deal.
[02:33:12.790 --> 02:33:14.152]  I want to talk to all of you.
[02:33:14.152 --> 02:33:27.470]  We may have time to jam some of your calls in during the last 30 minutes of the official broadcast with Dr. Paul Craig Roberts and Bob Chapman riding shotgun in the wings with us, both great financial experts who predicted everything that's now unfolded.
[02:33:27.470 --> 02:33:28.251]  That's why they're here.
[02:33:28.812 --> 02:33:30.432]  And then we're going to do 30 minutes of overdrive.
[02:33:30.432 --> 02:33:35.194]  It'll be PrisonPlanet.tv only and Infowars.com audio stream only.
[02:33:35.194 --> 02:33:36.534]  Quite frankly, it's up on the satellite.
[02:33:36.534 --> 02:33:38.695]  Some stations do actually carry it.
[02:33:38.695 --> 02:33:39.675]  So that's going to be happening.
[02:33:39.675 --> 02:33:46.577]  We will get to those calls then, one way or another, even if the water rises over Bear Creek, as they say.
[02:33:46.577 --> 02:33:49.718]  Now, Dr. Paul Craig Roberts has written a host of new articles.
[02:33:49.718 --> 02:33:52.719]  He's got one dealing with the entire bin Laden
[02:33:53.559 --> 02:33:54.580]  I think so.
[02:34:12.415 --> 02:34:17.661]  But before we go to our guest, I want to tell you about a few of the sponsors that have made today's radio show possible.
[02:34:17.661 --> 02:34:20.003]  One of them is purewaterfreedom.com.
[02:34:20.003 --> 02:34:24.908]  If you want to affordably remove fluoride from your tap water, visit purewaterfreedom.com.
[02:34:24.908 --> 02:34:27.531]  They have a full line of household fluoride filters.
[02:34:27.531 --> 02:34:30.815]  You can even remove fluoride from every water source in your home with a whole house
[02:34:31.115 --> 02:34:31.515]  All right.
[02:34:55.942 --> 02:35:09.191]  And lastly, Interfood is a revolutionary 100% organic green superfood energy drink with powerful nutrition for better health, energy, mental clarity, and immune system support.
[02:35:09.191 --> 02:35:13.254]  It was even voted best superfood by our great friend Mike Adams from Natural News.
[02:35:13.254 --> 02:35:15.256]  I know my wife takes it, Rob Jacobson takes it.
[02:35:15.256 --> 02:35:22.141]  They swear it's the best green food out there because it's composed of nearly 50% chloralena, spirulina, kelp, and dulse.
[02:35:22.141 --> 02:35:24.823]  It just has so many incredible superfoods in it, 20 total.
[02:35:25.623 --> 02:35:34.769]  Give them a call today at 866-762-9238, 866-762-9238, or visit them on their website at www.interfood.com.
[02:35:34.769 --> 02:35:46.496]  So, we've got for the next 25 minutes to the end of the hour, Dr. Paul Craig Roberts, best-selling author, former editor of the Wall Street Journal, former head of policy department of Treasury under Reagan, the father of Reaganomics.
[02:35:47.556 --> 02:35:53.901]  Who has laid out the fact that we've offshored our economy and so nothing is going to fix it.
[02:35:53.901 --> 02:35:56.142]  And until that's discussed, we have no hope.
[02:35:56.142 --> 02:36:00.485]  And talked about, of course, the debt ceiling being a discussion of rearranging deck chairs in the Titanic.
[02:36:00.485 --> 02:36:07.330]  We're going to get into that with him and what's happened in the markets and get Bob Chapman's take and have Bob ask some questions or have these two gentlemen converse.
[02:36:07.330 --> 02:36:09.311]  I think it's interesting to have the two together.
[02:36:09.311 --> 02:36:15.416]  But first, this Bin Laden development in New Yorker magazine, very
[02:36:15.896 --> 02:36:17.497]  Very interesting.
[02:36:17.497 --> 02:36:19.759]  And then we'll dovetail that with Russian envoy.
[02:36:19.759 --> 02:36:23.101]  NATO is planning attacks on Syria and Iran next.
[02:36:23.101 --> 02:36:25.923]  We'll get Dr. Paul Craig Roberts' take on that.
[02:36:25.923 --> 02:36:27.704]  Doc, good to have you here with us.
[02:36:27.704 --> 02:36:28.825]  Hi, it's Alex.
[02:36:28.825 --> 02:36:30.406]  So, let's get into your latest column.
[02:36:30.406 --> 02:36:31.247]  It's very interesting.
[02:36:33.123 --> 02:36:46.380]  Well, Alex, you know the New Yorker published this story that was planted, I think, on the journalist by sources who claim to know about the killing of bin Laden.
[02:36:46.380 --> 02:36:48.883]  And it's obviously a fairy tale.
[02:36:49.904 --> 02:36:57.877]  I think it had a purpose, which was to sort of explain why the SEALs killed bin Laden instead of capturing him.
[02:36:57.877 --> 02:37:01.302]  And the explanation given was that the U.S.
[02:37:01.302 --> 02:37:03.125]  government didn't want any detainees.
[02:37:05.734 --> 02:37:13.758]  And then it was to give an explanation of why they dumped his body in the ocean instead of producing the evidence.
[02:37:13.758 --> 02:37:22.042]  And the answer was, well, that's the way the SEALs have disposed of other victims, and it was just what they did.
[02:37:22.042 --> 02:37:29.766]  But before they did it, they called up some Saudi intelligent official somewhere and got his approval.
[02:37:29.766 --> 02:37:32.307]  So, obviously, it's...
[02:37:34.161 --> 02:37:46.127]  It's just some sort of repeat of the story that we were told earlier after they finally changed it a dozen times and put it together.
[02:37:46.127 --> 02:37:50.929]  And the question that I raised was, why didn't the New Yorker send somebody to
[02:37:52.250 --> 02:38:05.018]  Interview the Pakistani who watched the whole thing from the roof of his house next door to the alleged compound of Bin Laden and who was interviewed on Pakistani television.
[02:38:06.204 --> 02:38:09.247]  I watched the interview, but I couldn't understand the language.
[02:38:09.247 --> 02:38:17.655]  But someone had put an English translation running along the bottom of the video and script.
[02:38:17.655 --> 02:38:21.758]  And what he was saying was that, well, there were three helicopters.
[02:38:21.758 --> 02:38:23.100]  One landed.
[02:38:23.100 --> 02:38:25.362]  About a dozen people got out, went in the house.
[02:38:25.362 --> 02:38:30.647]  A few minutes later, they came back, got in the helicopter, and as it lifted off, it blew up, and they were all killed.
[02:38:31.696 --> 02:38:42.220]  And I saw the bodies all over the place, and pieces of bodies, and we went down, and the Pakistani military came and shoot us off.
[02:38:42.220 --> 02:38:43.260]  Well, the U.S.
[02:38:43.260 --> 02:38:51.063]  government acknowledges it lost a helicopter, but it claims nobody was injured somehow, and it crashed.
[02:38:51.063 --> 02:39:00.027]  By the way, to back you up, they have had major Arabic-speaking news outfits have translated that, and that is true, and other witnesses said there was a guy that lived there,
[02:39:00.447 --> 02:39:03.188]  For years, and he looked like bin Laden, but it wasn't bin Laden.
[02:39:03.188 --> 02:39:05.429]  They've never produced the wives they say they grabbed.
[02:39:05.429 --> 02:39:08.510]  There wasn't the shootout, the human shield.
[02:39:08.510 --> 02:39:11.731]  There wasn't, you know, the Islamic law burial at sea.
[02:39:11.731 --> 02:39:18.374]  It's all just, you know, the fake situation room photos that we said were fake, now admitted to be fake.
[02:39:18.374 --> 02:39:22.356]  I mean, it's just absolutely asinine that this is going on.
[02:39:22.356 --> 02:39:24.897]  Well, they started it all over again, and it's now in the New Yorker.
[02:39:25.837 --> 02:39:37.783]  You know, I wish somebody would translate this broadcast of the interview with Bashir, because it's freely available on YouTube.
[02:39:37.783 --> 02:39:44.546]  There must be somebody who knows the language that can confirm what he's actually saying.
[02:39:44.546 --> 02:39:51.289]  Now, if he's saying what I read, in other words, the English translation I saw wasn't a hoax,
[02:39:52.674 --> 02:39:57.137]  Then we have a totally different story from what the government has told us.
[02:39:57.137 --> 02:40:11.167]  And you would think that the intelligence committees of Congress would be interested, that somebody in the media would be interested, even a New Yorker, because they well-published from time to time Cy Hearst.
[02:40:11.167 --> 02:40:14.709]  I mean, he could go over there and interview the guy and find out what happened.
[02:40:14.709 --> 02:40:20.153]  And then we could have maybe a bit of truth get out instead of all these fairy tales.
[02:40:20.393 --> 02:40:26.660]  Well, I think what I'm getting from this is you've had respect for the New Yorker in the past, and they have broken a lot of big things.
[02:40:26.660 --> 02:40:34.468]  Ty Hirsch did break that Dick Cheney wanted to attack our own ships, what, five years ago, and blame it on the Iranians with fake patrol boats.
[02:40:34.468 --> 02:40:38.212]  He exposed Operation Phoenix and the torture in Vietnam.
[02:40:38.212 --> 02:40:41.196]  But let me tell you, this is for Obama, though.
[02:40:41.636 --> 02:40:46.261]  We know there are big Democrats over there, so they seem to only break stuff on Republicans.
[02:40:46.261 --> 02:40:47.562]  Very partisan outfits.
[02:40:47.562 --> 02:40:53.127]  So, Dr. Roberts, I would advise that you not hold your breath because, you know, we need you.
[02:40:53.127 --> 02:40:55.189]  I don't think you're going to get that out of them.
[02:40:55.189 --> 02:40:57.731]  No, I won't hold my breath.
[02:40:57.731 --> 02:41:05.218]  Somebody could very easily translate the language interview and put it up so that we would have it.
[02:41:06.380 --> 02:41:15.288]  Let me briefly get Bob Chapman's take on this, and instead of Alex Jones asking a question about the economy, I'll have Bob throw one at you, and you guys can go back and forth.
[02:41:15.288 --> 02:41:18.071]  Bob Chapman of The International Forecaster.
[02:41:18.071 --> 02:41:22.035]  Bob, you got any comments on the whole Osama Bin Laden rabbit trick?
[02:41:23.633 --> 02:41:35.023]  I think it's a rewrite, just like Mr. Roberts said, and I think they continue to try to redo the mistakes that they've made.
[02:41:35.023 --> 02:41:40.227]  They made a terrible mess out of it, especially for someone who's been deceased for some time.
[02:41:40.227 --> 02:41:41.849]  And they just
[02:41:44.210 --> 02:41:45.290]  Made a mess of it again.
[02:41:45.290 --> 02:42:03.718]  As far as the economy is concerned, I would like to get the take, Mr. Roberts, on has QE3 started, or when do you think it will?
[02:42:03.718 --> 02:42:07.259]  I have my ideas, and what do you think?
[02:42:07.259 --> 02:42:10.521]  Well, you know, Bob, they might start at this time without telling us.
[02:42:11.633 --> 02:42:13.274]  But I don't see how that's important.
[02:42:13.274 --> 02:42:14.974]  That's what I think they already did.
[02:42:14.974 --> 02:42:23.277]  Well, notice he said months ago he wouldn't do it, and now they say, well, we may have to, but there's every indicator they're still monetizing debt, aren't they?
[02:42:23.277 --> 02:42:28.519]  Well, I don't know.
[02:42:28.519 --> 02:42:35.321]  You know, right now, what we do know is they used up yesterday 60% of their new debt ceiling increase.
[02:42:40.385 --> 02:42:47.648]  I think the problem that the government faces is it's got more crises than it's aware of.
[02:42:47.648 --> 02:43:02.054]  And it's thinking that it just has some sort of a deep recession, but it's thinking in the normal terms of a post-war recession where workers are laid off from jobs that still exist.
[02:43:03.431 --> 02:43:11.956]  And could be called back to work if the government can pump up demand enough, can create enough new aggregate demand.
[02:43:11.956 --> 02:43:14.297]  They're still thinking in that model.
[02:43:14.297 --> 02:43:20.661]  You see it, for example, in Paul Krugman, who says that we could recover if the government would just run a bigger deficit.
[02:43:21.795 --> 02:43:32.378]  And then they have another problem on top of that that they do recognize, and that is that they've got an ongoing financial crisis.
[02:43:32.378 --> 02:43:41.160]  No one really knows the true state of the banks and whether they're solvent or not.
[02:43:43.363 --> 02:43:53.717]  But what they don't understand is they have let offshoring destroy the economy and there are no jobs to call people back to work to.
[02:43:53.717 --> 02:44:00.025]  Well isn't this the banksters thinking that their fiat paper derivative economy is a real economy?
[02:44:00.265 --> 02:44:03.806]  I mean, at the end of the day, you can't eat that paper, and you just mentioned it.
[02:44:03.806 --> 02:44:07.126]  Here's French news agency two days ago explaining this to me.
[02:44:07.126 --> 02:44:07.526]  U.S.
[02:44:07.526 --> 02:44:13.288]  borrowing tops 100% of GDP the day they lifted it.
[02:44:13.288 --> 02:44:13.608]  U.S.
[02:44:13.608 --> 02:44:20.909]  debt shot up $238 billion to reach 100% of gross domestic product over the government's debt ceiling was lifted.
[02:44:20.909 --> 02:44:23.210]  Treasury figures showed Wednesday.
[02:44:23.210 --> 02:44:24.410]  Treasury borrowing jumped
[02:44:24.750 --> 02:44:30.536]  Tuesday, the data showed immediately after President Obama signed into law increases in the debt ceiling.
[02:44:30.536 --> 02:44:36.503]  So as you just said, this isn't saying they gobbled up most of it, it says they gobbled it all up immediately.
[02:44:37.554 --> 02:44:48.704]  Well, I think what the French is saying is that the debt raised increased enough that it's now equal to the gross domestic product.
[02:44:48.704 --> 02:44:55.971]  And of course, the gross domestic product may be falling and it may be overstated because they've been understating inflation.
[02:44:55.971 --> 02:45:00.455]  And if you understate inflation, it looks like you've got more than you've got.
[02:45:00.455 --> 02:45:01.315]  I think
[02:45:04.177 --> 02:45:13.981]  Alex, during World War II, the debt was actually a larger share of the gross domestic product than right now.
[02:45:13.981 --> 02:45:22.725]  But there is a big difference in that we now have, during World War II, we didn't have an all assured economy.
[02:45:22.725 --> 02:45:24.965]  The economy was still there.
[02:45:24.965 --> 02:45:31.028]  And so going into debt in the four years was building the real physical economy, so at the end of it, we were the kings of the earth.
[02:45:32.172 --> 02:45:38.675]  So now we have the economy, it's in Japan and India and Indonesia and anywhere and wherever.
[02:45:38.675 --> 02:45:46.197]  So you can't revive that economy by printing money and running deficits.
[02:45:46.197 --> 02:45:51.559]  And I don't think the policymakers or the economics profession have caught on to that.
[02:45:51.559 --> 02:45:58.002]  And the dilemma they have, and I think Bob will agree with this, is that they're trying to
[02:45:59.442 --> 02:46:03.446]  Have quantitative easing and flood the system with money.
[02:46:03.446 --> 02:46:10.332]  It's not causing inflation, as you would expect, because it's staying in the banks.
[02:46:10.332 --> 02:46:12.974]  When it gets back to the banking system, it halts.
[02:46:12.974 --> 02:46:17.899]  They're not using the reserves to create a lot of new loans.
[02:46:17.899 --> 02:46:25.605]  So we're not having as high a rate of money creation in the overall economy as the Fed is creating.
[02:46:26.446 --> 02:46:47.701]  And so we're not having inflation that way, but all this outpouring worries the rest of the world about the dollar, because they hold all their central bank reserves and dollars, and they see all this, and so the dollar is taking the hit, and then the inflation we get comes in from the fall in the exchange value of the dollar.
[02:46:48.835 --> 02:46:55.841]  I looked today and it looked like the Swiss franc had made another new high against the dollar.
[02:46:55.841 --> 02:47:01.285]  The mighty dollar is now worth 76 Swiss cents.
[02:47:01.285 --> 02:47:08.050]  So the inflation we're getting is coming in from the dollar's loss of exchange value.
[02:47:08.050 --> 02:47:14.515]  And so now they're faced with, you can't support the dollar and save the dollar.
[02:47:15.501 --> 02:47:22.563]  And also, bail out the banks, monetize the Treasury's debt.
[02:47:22.563 --> 02:47:24.463]  So, which are they going to choose?
[02:47:24.463 --> 02:47:33.705]  They're going to have one crisis, and then when that crisis becomes clear, they'll try to do the opposite, and then the other crisis will come.
[02:47:33.705 --> 02:47:40.747]  So it's like a balancing act in a cartoon where you've got a hundred different plates and pots in your hand, it's only a matter of time until it falls.
[02:47:40.747 --> 02:47:42.567]  Bob Chapman, your take on what he's saying.
[02:47:43.993 --> 02:47:45.173]  No, I agree with all of it.
[02:47:45.173 --> 02:47:49.615]  I think it can't be understated.
[02:47:49.615 --> 02:48:01.240]  The free trade, globalization, offshoring, outsourcing has cost us 11.7 million jobs in almost 11 years.
[02:48:01.240 --> 02:48:06.181]  440,400 companies have moved out of the country.
[02:48:06.181 --> 02:48:12.684]  And without those kinds of manufacturing, we can never, ever recover.
[02:48:13.445 --> 02:48:17.127]  And so, how do you change that?
[02:48:17.127 --> 02:48:24.632]  We need legislation which would put tariffs on goods and services so that we can play in a level playing field.
[02:48:24.632 --> 02:48:32.317]  And you'll see every day, Japan's in the market because their currency's too strong, so they're trying to make it weak.
[02:48:32.317 --> 02:48:34.519]  The Swiss just did the same thing.
[02:48:34.519 --> 02:48:39.162]  They've been both unsuccessful for those who want stronger currencies.
[02:48:41.103 --> 02:48:46.844]  I think eventually a lot of that money is going to go into gold, maybe silver as well.
[02:48:46.844 --> 02:48:55.027]  And so what we have is an economy that even if it wanted to couldn't recover and at the same time
[02:48:56.201 --> 02:49:03.104]  As Mr. Roberts said, they, the banks, are holding goo gobs of money.
[02:49:03.104 --> 02:49:04.385]  Two trillion, I'm sure.
[02:49:04.385 --> 02:49:07.146]  Actually, it's a little higher than that.
[02:49:07.146 --> 02:49:08.707]  And they're not using it.
[02:49:08.707 --> 02:49:10.147]  Well, that was my next question.
[02:49:10.147 --> 02:49:13.229]  What's this statement today that big banks in the U.S.
[02:49:13.229 --> 02:49:19.652]  are going to start charging people, including big institutions, charging them to hold their cash?
[02:49:19.652 --> 02:49:22.093]  I thought that was only the case in money laundering, Dr. Roberts.
[02:49:23.553 --> 02:49:24.714]  I don't know why they're doing it.
[02:49:24.714 --> 02:49:35.979]  You know, Switzerland did that back in the 80s when gold was up and the dollar was having trouble because so much foreign money was pouring into Switzerland at the time.
[02:49:35.979 --> 02:49:38.660]  It was driving the frank too high.
[02:49:38.660 --> 02:49:42.022]  So the way you put money in Switzerland then was you opened a bank account.
[02:49:43.837 --> 02:49:47.660]  And so they would charge you if you put your dollars there.
[02:49:47.660 --> 02:49:50.181]  I don't know what the banks here are doing it for.
[02:49:50.181 --> 02:50:04.590]  Maybe they're just desperate for fees and money and maybe they realize that people with big holdings don't trust the stock market and realize that the bond market might be the next to tumble and so they're stuck in cash.
[02:50:06.731 --> 02:50:14.953]  Let me throw this out real quick, because we're going to break, and we're going to come back and see where this is going with Dr. Roberts, then we'll continue on with Bob Chapman.
[02:50:14.953 --> 02:50:22.194]  Why do you think the Italian government has raided Moody's and S&P, the rating agencies in Italy?
[02:50:22.194 --> 02:50:23.654]  I don't know about that.
[02:50:23.654 --> 02:50:24.134]  Ask Bob.
[02:50:24.134 --> 02:50:30.595]  I don't either, but I can tell you that they would be trying to coerce them.
[02:50:30.595 --> 02:50:33.156]  Just back to the charging of interest.
[02:50:34.088 --> 02:50:38.451]  Uh, on large deposit, they want to drive that money into the treasury market.
[02:50:38.451 --> 02:50:41.152]  That's my take on it.
[02:50:41.152 --> 02:50:41.732]  Yeah.
[02:50:41.732 --> 02:50:49.376]  So they want to force folks out of just sitting in bank accounts and to prop up treasury so the Fed doesn't have to monetize it because they claim they're going to cut back on that.
[02:50:49.376 --> 02:50:49.997]  Okay.
[02:50:49.997 --> 02:50:53.419]  I want to see where Dr. Roberts thinks this economy is going.
[02:50:53.419 --> 02:50:55.740]  And then we'll get a final comment in the hour from Bob Chapman.
[02:50:55.740 --> 02:50:57.561]  Then Bob will stay with us 30 more minutes.
[02:50:57.561 --> 02:50:58.802]  We'll be right back on the other side.
[02:50:58.802 --> 02:50:59.222]  Stay with us.
[02:51:01.929 --> 02:51:05.291]  Will I have garlic breath after I take Ali-C?
[02:51:05.291 --> 02:51:09.633]  We get that question all the time about the world's best garlic extract, Ali-C.
[02:51:09.633 --> 02:51:18.477]  And the answer is, Ali-C contains stabilized allicin, nature's antimicrobial agent, and the active ingredient in crushed garlic, but will not give you garlic breath.
[02:51:18.477 --> 02:51:25.460]  Scientifically proven in double-blind studies, using low doses of allicin greatly reduces the number, severity, and duration of common colds.
[02:51:25.760 --> 02:51:29.884]  Our powerful Ali-C contains 300 milligrams of stabilized allicin.
[02:51:29.884 --> 02:51:33.988]  Just one tablet of Ali-C is equivalent to 40 garlic cloves.
[02:51:33.988 --> 02:51:40.714]  It's effective against asthma, MRSA, bacterial fungal and viral infections and helps lower high blood pressure and high cholesterol.
[02:51:40.854 --> 02:51:42.957]  Plus, it's a natural mosquito repellent.
[02:51:42.957 --> 02:51:47.041]  Boosts resistance to infection with nature's best garlic extract, Ali-C.
[02:51:47.041 --> 02:51:51.387]  For more information and to order Ali-C, call 877-888-7126 or go to GarlicHealthProducts.com.
[02:51:51.387 --> 02:51:53.489]  That's 877-888-7126 or GarlicHealthProducts.com.
[02:51:53.489 --> 02:51:54.270]  Fight back with Ali-C.
[02:52:01.298 --> 02:52:02.698]  Hello, I'm Alex Jones.
[02:52:02.698 --> 02:52:13.360]  Myself, my family, the InfoWars.com team want to relay to you and your families that we are intensifying our efforts against the globalists on every front.
[02:52:13.360 --> 02:52:20.562]  InfoWars.com is leading the fight against the technocrats, but we can't do that without your help.
[02:52:20.562 --> 02:52:27.463]  By getting the films, bumper stickers, and t-shirts at InfoWars.com, you will wake up people in your area and
[02:52:27.483 --> 02:52:31.846]  You can support our operation as we move to the next level.
[02:52:31.846 --> 02:52:35.328]  We need your help to spread the word like never before.
[02:52:35.328 --> 02:52:41.472]  They wish to hide themselves during this tectonic battle between the forces of freedom and darkness.
[02:52:41.472 --> 02:52:50.898]  You are the response to the globalist technocrats and their program of global eugenics dehumanization and ultimate extermination.
[02:52:51.358 --> 02:52:52.860]  The war is here.
[02:52:52.860 --> 02:52:54.762]  It's an info war.
[02:52:54.762 --> 02:53:01.128]  The spirit of 1776 versus the mindset of 1984.
[02:53:01.128 --> 02:53:03.630]  Big Berkey water filters are in high demand.
[02:53:03.630 --> 02:53:05.692]  Storable foods are also in high demand.
[02:53:05.692 --> 02:53:10.557]  BigBerkeyWaterFilters.com has always kept our focus on the Berkey water filter products.
[02:53:10.717 --> 02:53:14.422]  But increasingly, our customers have been asking for storable foods.

[02:54:13.476 --> 02:54:31.311]  Here's the latest headlines.
[02:54:31.311 --> 02:54:34.314]  China debt ceiling lift.
[02:54:34.314 --> 02:54:37.316]  Unlikely to save U.S.
[02:54:37.316 --> 02:54:38.177]  economy.
[02:54:38.177 --> 02:54:40.158]  Eating May's grain in April.
[02:54:41.041 --> 02:54:42.662]  Being lectured by the Chinese.
[02:54:42.662 --> 02:54:45.883]  I mean, what have we let these foreign bankers do to us?
[02:54:45.883 --> 02:54:48.484]  Italy to take up balanced budget amendment.
[02:54:48.484 --> 02:54:50.305]  Stock market shooting up and down.
[02:54:50.305 --> 02:54:51.645]  Now it's plunging again.
[02:54:51.645 --> 02:54:54.527]  We'll be covering, come up in the next 30 minutes.
[02:54:54.527 --> 02:54:57.108]  It's just so crazy.
[02:54:57.108 --> 02:54:58.928]  Two-year treasury yield drops.
[02:54:58.928 --> 02:55:04.251]  Dr. Roberts, I remember three years ago, you said, well, if we don't turn this around, we'll basically be
[02:55:05.291 --> 02:55:08.513]  At where we've now come to in three years.
[02:55:08.513 --> 02:55:12.875]  So where, if this continues, and clearly they're not changing the policies.
[02:55:12.875 --> 02:55:14.596]  You know, we always talk about solutions.
[02:55:14.596 --> 02:55:15.457]  They don't care.
[02:55:15.457 --> 02:55:16.497]  They like what's happening.
[02:55:16.497 --> 02:55:18.638]  It's consolidating power.
[02:55:18.638 --> 02:55:20.980]  You're saying, well, they just must be idiots.
[02:55:20.980 --> 02:55:23.281]  But at the end of the day, I mean, they're not complete morons.
[02:55:23.281 --> 02:55:26.302]  So they're all making record bonuses in these big mega banks.
[02:55:26.302 --> 02:55:28.263]  So where is this going?
[02:55:28.263 --> 02:55:32.546]  Where does this course we're on right now with this mad captain take us?
[02:55:34.569 --> 02:55:36.430]  To the third world.
[02:55:36.430 --> 02:55:42.131]  We'll be a third world country in another 12, 15 years.
[02:55:42.131 --> 02:55:43.872]  And that's where we're going.
[02:55:43.872 --> 02:55:48.773]  That's what I predicted at the beginning of this new century.
[02:55:48.773 --> 02:55:53.654]  And there's no departure from that course.
[02:55:53.654 --> 02:55:57.355]  It's going to be a third world economy.
[02:55:57.355 --> 02:56:02.777]  And there are a lot of villains who will be responsible.
[02:56:04.045 --> 02:56:09.039]  And as you say, they seem to be happy with it, but...
[02:56:10.382 --> 02:56:19.847]  I still maintain they don't understand what's going on or they don't understand enough of what's going on.
[02:56:19.847 --> 02:56:27.111]  Well, a lot of them talk about a post-industrial world and how great, you know, the recession's been to cut carbon footprint.
[02:56:27.111 --> 02:56:35.035]  I go to Whole Foods and half the magazines for the sandaled trendies is about how great it is to be poor and how America needs to fall apart.
[02:56:35.995 --> 02:56:40.079]  I mean, I think you underestimate just how wicked these people are.
[02:56:40.079 --> 02:56:46.805]  Yeah, but they don't benefit from destroying a powerful economy where they have huge stakes.
[02:56:46.805 --> 02:56:52.250]  So, that's why I... No, I understand.
[02:56:52.250 --> 02:56:54.852]  If they have America captured, why would they want to destroy it?
[02:56:54.852 --> 02:56:57.594]  Because the globalists hate us that much.
[02:56:57.594 --> 02:56:58.796]  I mean, they can't help it.
[02:56:58.796 --> 02:57:01.098]  They'd rather... No, I think, Alex, this is self-inflicted.
[02:57:01.918 --> 02:57:04.540]  This is self-inflicted.
[02:57:04.540 --> 02:57:23.557]  It was Wall Street and the big retailers that drove the American industry offshore and hired all the name economists to call it globalism and say that we were benefiting and to pretend it's free trade.
[02:57:25.229 --> 02:57:32.151]  So it's domestically, and it was Bush and Cheney who launched us on these interminable wars.
[02:57:32.151 --> 02:57:35.832]  You know, we've been at war now for ten years.
[02:57:35.832 --> 02:57:42.895]  They've wasted more on these wars than they hope to recover from the debt limit deal.
[02:57:42.895 --> 02:57:46.936]  You mean they've launched kinetic actions of peace, sir?
[02:57:46.936 --> 02:57:48.516]  Yeah, right.
[02:57:48.516 --> 02:57:53.938]  And so they're caught between an unfunded military budget
[02:57:55.914 --> 02:57:58.577]  Uh, a deteriorating tax base.
[02:57:58.577 --> 02:58:03.742]  You know, every time a job is offshored, the income, the tax base, the GDP goes with it.
[02:58:05.638 --> 02:58:13.244]  And as Bob says, the main problem is to keep financing a massive deficit that's not going away.
[02:58:13.244 --> 02:58:19.469]  In fact, as I said the other day, the deficit projections will have to be reissued before long.
[02:58:19.469 --> 02:58:24.833]  And because the economy is falling down again, they're going to be larger.
[02:58:24.833 --> 02:58:26.135]  They're going to be bigger deficits.
[02:58:26.835 --> 02:58:29.958]  And so they've got to finance these deficits, and so how are they going to do it?
[02:58:29.958 --> 02:58:32.039]  There's not enough world savings to do it.
[02:58:32.039 --> 02:58:34.701]  The Chinese and Japanese... So bottom line, we're falling apart.
[02:58:34.701 --> 02:58:38.425]  Dr. Paul Craig Roberts, author of War of the Worlds, How the Economy Was Lost.
[02:58:38.425 --> 02:58:38.765]  Thank you.
[02:58:38.765 --> 02:58:40.506]  See you back here Sunday, 4 to 6 p.m.
[02:58:40.506 --> 02:58:44.630]  We're going into overdrive, internet only.
[02:58:44.630 --> 02:58:47.772]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[02:58:47.772 --> 02:58:49.674]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[02:58:51.564 --> 02:58:56.127]  This is Alex Jones with 5 good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[02:58:56.127 --> 02:58:57.028]  Number 1.
[02:58:57.028 --> 02:59:00.450]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[02:59:00.450 --> 02:59:01.311]  Number 2.
[02:59:01.311 --> 02:59:06.214]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[02:59:06.214 --> 02:59:06.954]  It's true.
[02:59:06.954 --> 02:59:11.818]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[02:59:11.818 --> 02:59:12.658]  Number 3.
[02:59:12.658 --> 02:59:16.240]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[02:59:16.240 --> 02:59:19.923]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[02:59:20.143 --> 02:59:20.924]  Number 4.
[02:59:20.924 --> 02:59:23.686]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[02:59:23.686 --> 02:59:27.369]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[02:59:27.369 --> 02:59:28.170]  Number 5.
[02:59:28.170 --> 02:59:32.314]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[02:59:32.314 --> 02:59:37.078]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[02:59:37.358 --> 02:59:41.522]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[02:59:41.522 --> 02:59:43.323]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[02:59:43.323 --> 02:59:45.565]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun.
[02:59:45.565 --> 02:59:48.187]  So go to mysolarbackup.com or call 1-877-327-0365.
[02:59:48.187 --> 02:59:53.992]  Coast to Coast.
[02:59:53.992 --> 02:59:56.034]  Direct from Austin.
[02:59:56.034 --> 02:59:59.257]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network.
[03:00:14.205 --> 03:00:17.147]  Alright, Bob Chapman is our guest to be with us for the next 30 minutes.
[03:00:17.147 --> 03:00:21.209]  We're going to jam some of your phone calls in here as well.
[03:00:21.209 --> 03:00:24.591]  Ted Anderson will be popping in too, coming up in the next segment.
[03:00:24.591 --> 03:00:27.773]  You know, Roberts is a smart guy, great guy.
[03:00:28.863 --> 03:00:31.206]  But, I mean, I've read the UN documents.
[03:00:31.206 --> 03:00:34.912]  I've seen their statements about destroying economies to consolidate them.
[03:00:34.912 --> 03:00:37.155]  They don't want free market economies anymore.
[03:00:37.155 --> 03:00:41.000]  They don't want people having a future stake in things.
[03:00:41.000 --> 03:00:45.386]  And they're going to bring down the third world, China, Russia, Europe, everybody.
[03:00:46.047 --> 03:00:51.793]  They've set up a system where we're dependent on resources, an industrialized modern state.
[03:00:51.793 --> 03:00:52.995]  They cut them off.
[03:00:52.995 --> 03:00:59.602]  It's like De Beers has a monopoly on diamonds that are semi-precious but are ultra-precious because of their monopoly.
[03:00:59.602 --> 03:01:00.543]  Same thing with oil.
[03:01:00.543 --> 03:01:03.747]  They push the idea that it's super scarce when we're drowning in it.
[03:01:04.167 --> 03:01:08.889]  And they have every foppish, fake intellectual telling you we're out of oil.
[03:01:08.889 --> 03:01:21.534]  This is a planned program, post-industrial society, just like California putting 20% carbon taxes when they're falling into the, you know, ocean, and got a 30-plus percent unemployment rate.
[03:01:21.534 --> 03:01:23.235]  This is their goal.
[03:01:23.235 --> 03:01:24.516]  This is their goal.
[03:01:24.516 --> 03:01:27.277]  This is economic conquest, scorched earth.
[03:01:27.277 --> 03:01:29.618]  Bob Chapman, do you disagree with that statement?
[03:01:30.916 --> 03:01:54.049]  I agree completely, and the final analysis is this fascist model that they put into being, which we always thought would probably be an extension of communism, is set up to bring the world to their knees, particularly Western Europe and the United States and Great Britain, so that people will be forced to accept this new world order, this one world government.
[03:01:55.535 --> 03:01:58.897]  Absolutely, and they're setting up Und Homeland.
[03:01:58.897 --> 03:02:00.218]  They claim it's for the Muslims.
[03:02:00.218 --> 03:02:04.481]  Notice they flip it now onto the people that don't like the foreign bankers.
[03:02:04.481 --> 03:02:08.963]  Oh, you don't like the occupation of finance capital who are non-free market?
[03:02:08.963 --> 03:02:10.404]  Oh, well, you're a terrorist.
[03:02:10.404 --> 03:02:11.765]  And you can see the writing on the wall.
[03:02:11.765 --> 03:02:14.427]  They're going to blow stuff up and blame it on us, Bob.
[03:02:14.427 --> 03:02:16.768]  I mean, they had a media matter.
[03:02:16.768 --> 03:02:17.489]  Absolutely.
[03:02:17.489 --> 03:02:17.789]  Go ahead.
[03:02:18.962 --> 03:02:20.263]  No, you go ahead.
[03:02:20.263 --> 03:02:22.425]  I'm just agreeing with adjectives.
[03:02:22.425 --> 03:02:23.646]  You're right.
[03:02:23.646 --> 03:02:24.987]  No, it's just it's disgusting.
[03:02:24.987 --> 03:02:27.029]  Media matters took me out of context yesterday.
[03:02:27.029 --> 03:02:32.734]  And by the end of the article, it implies I'm calling for murdering police when it's the opposite.
[03:02:32.734 --> 03:02:36.557]  I mean, they're really getting ready to try to set us up because we're kicking their hind end, Bob.
[03:02:37.438 --> 03:02:42.822]  That's right and we're going to continue to do it and we're not going to get sucked into their vortex of evil.
[03:02:42.822 --> 03:02:47.645]  They're not going to be able to get away with it because too many people out there know what they're up to.
[03:02:47.645 --> 03:02:56.991]  It's just like all of the information that you came up with that you believe was going to happen about Whitey the Terrorist and there he was.
[03:02:56.991 --> 03:02:58.612]  He appeared in Oslo and
[03:03:00.603 --> 03:03:06.666]  That was what you were talking about, and you predicted that they would do something like that, and they did!
[03:03:06.666 --> 03:03:16.910]  But if there's any doubt now, this week, with the Vice President and all of them saying, and the New York Times and Politico, hundreds, yes, Whitey is the terrorist, the Tea Party are going to bomb us.
[03:03:17.430 --> 03:03:19.152]  I mean, folks, how obvious.
[03:03:19.152 --> 03:03:24.898]  They're saying we're going to bomb them, and then they got White House memos about how a bombing will help them.
[03:03:24.898 --> 03:03:29.002]  Police, who should you be looking at if you were living in the real world?
[03:03:29.002 --> 03:03:31.265]  I mean, Bob, you worked in intelligence.
[03:03:31.265 --> 03:03:32.246]  Who would you look at?
[03:03:32.246 --> 03:03:34.789]  You got groups saying, boy, a terror attack would sure help us.
[03:03:34.789 --> 03:03:36.590]  They start saying this group's going to bomb.
[03:03:36.590 --> 03:03:38.833]  I mean, right there, you got them.
[03:03:38.833 --> 03:03:39.674]  They're getting ready to do it.
[03:03:40.592 --> 03:03:41.953]  That's right.
[03:03:41.953 --> 03:03:52.862]  And you know, they really make so many mistakes, and they have to scramble to cover it up like in this Oslo affair, and all the others that they've made.
[03:03:52.862 --> 03:04:00.928]  And because they control the media in almost totality, at least the mainstream, they can get away with it.
[03:04:00.928 --> 03:04:07.534]  They keep on telling the same lie over and over again, and sometimes in variations as we saw today.
[03:04:10.496 --> 03:04:12.679]  Uh, Joseph Goebbels say.
[03:04:12.679 --> 03:04:13.319]  The same thing!
[03:04:13.319 --> 03:04:16.623]  They keep on telling him the same lie and they're gonna believe it!
[03:04:20.506 --> 03:04:27.629]  The good news is, 69% in a Rasmussen poll believe the scientists are lying about global warming.
[03:04:27.629 --> 03:04:32.112]  And now they're having to admit, okay, there was less ice 5,000 years ago.
[03:04:32.112 --> 03:04:34.453]  Okay, the sun does heat the earth.
[03:04:34.453 --> 03:04:41.016]  I mean, more and more, their ridiculous lies are coming home to bite them in their man-bear-pig hind ends.
[03:04:42.537 --> 03:04:43.838]  Well, they sure are.
[03:04:43.838 --> 03:04:46.280]  And rightly so.
[03:04:46.280 --> 03:04:49.303]  And they expect all of us to be dumb.
[03:04:49.303 --> 03:04:50.764]  And you know something?
[03:04:50.764 --> 03:04:53.807]  There's a lot of smart people in the world besides them.
[03:04:53.807 --> 03:04:58.331]  And they outnumber the people who are trying to do us in.
[03:04:58.331 --> 03:04:59.652]  And sooner or later, we're gonna win.
[03:04:59.932 --> 03:05:00.352]  We are.
[03:05:00.352 --> 03:05:01.472]  Stay there, Bob Chapman.
[03:05:01.472 --> 03:05:01.853]  Stay there.

[03:06:15.451 --> 03:06:16.533]  No one can deny.
[03:06:16.673 --> 03:06:27.416]  That our media operation is the tip of the spear, and it's because of our success that we have a responsibility to intensify our operations against the globalists 110%.
[03:06:27.416 --> 03:06:32.417]  We're only a month away from launching a weeknight news broadcast.
[03:06:32.417 --> 03:06:34.878]  The social network is nearing completion as well.
[03:06:34.878 --> 03:06:37.799]  The free newsletter is reaching hundreds of thousands.

[03:06:53.169 --> 03:06:55.230]  You are the resistance.
[03:06:55.230 --> 03:07:00.815]  It is up to us, the InfoWarriors, to take the initiative and to defeat the globalists.
[03:07:01.613 --> 03:07:04.895]  David J. Smith for Newswatch Magazine.
[03:07:04.895 --> 03:07:08.496]  Do you believe that Christians are going to be persecuted?
[03:07:08.496 --> 03:07:11.438]  Revelation 6-11 states they will.
[03:07:11.438 --> 03:07:15.259]  Revelation 13-7 states they will also.
[03:07:15.259 --> 03:07:24.664]  And then in Revelation 20 verse 4 states that some in the resurrection will have been beheaded for the witness of Jesus Christ.
[03:07:24.664 --> 03:07:26.825]  Beheading is usually done with a guillotine.
[03:07:27.725 --> 03:07:32.873]  Could that be why guillotines are stored on every military base in America?
[03:07:32.873 --> 03:07:34.616]  Not all Christians will be martyred.
[03:07:35.674 --> 03:07:42.077]  However, in Luke 21-36 it states that some will be counted worthy to escape.
[03:07:42.077 --> 03:07:49.701]  We'd like to help you understand these things by offering you an absolutely free one-year subscription to Newswatch Magazine.

[03:08:11.273 --> 03:08:12.853]  You want answers?
[03:08:12.853 --> 03:08:14.153]  Well, so does he.
[03:08:14.153 --> 03:08:18.595]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[03:08:18.595 --> 03:08:22.676]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[03:08:29.577 --> 03:08:34.520]  Alright, we are live, ladies and gentlemen, well into overdrive.
[03:08:34.520 --> 03:08:38.462]  So fix bayonets, we are into overdrive here.
[03:08:38.462 --> 03:08:41.904]  On this Friday edition, I'll be back this Sunday live, 4 to 6 p.m.
[03:08:41.904 --> 03:08:42.884]  Central.
[03:08:42.884 --> 03:08:44.065]  Bob Chapman's our guest.
[03:08:44.065 --> 03:08:47.887]  I want to go to the callers that are patiently holding there in just a moment.
[03:08:48.647 --> 03:08:50.048]  But this is how tyranny works.
[03:08:50.048 --> 03:09:02.755]  We're just incrementally watching big offshore banks gut Europe, gut the United States, just as they have absolutely robbed and butchered the third world, and they do it over and over again.
[03:09:02.755 --> 03:09:12.140]  Now the good news is, Hillary, Zbigniew Brzezinski, many others have pointed out, for the first time in modern history, people aren't looking at the puppets, they're looking at the shadow government.
[03:09:12.140 --> 03:09:17.623]  The globalist great power is that they hide it behind bureaucracy and corporatism.
[03:09:18.613 --> 03:09:23.858]  But once you start educating people, they can't get away with this anymore.
[03:09:23.858 --> 03:09:25.760]  And truth goes through three stages.
[03:09:25.760 --> 03:09:27.561]  First, it's ignored.
[03:09:27.561 --> 03:09:28.842]  Then it's attacked.
[03:09:28.842 --> 03:09:31.084]  Then it becomes self-evident.
[03:09:31.084 --> 03:09:33.827]  It's in the attack phase, but more and more people, it's becoming self-evident.
[03:09:33.827 --> 03:09:35.588]  Now, what do we get them to do?
[03:09:35.588 --> 03:09:38.471]  We get them to speak out to their friends, their family, their neighbors.
[03:09:38.471 --> 03:09:42.254]  Because just the moral authority of knowing the truth, it all ends.
[03:09:43.095 --> 03:09:45.998]  The police are putting trial balloons out all over the country.
[03:09:45.998 --> 03:09:51.563]  People do editorials mildly making fun of police with stick figure YouTube video.
[03:09:51.563 --> 03:09:55.786]  They are trying to indict them for felonies in Oregon.
[03:09:55.786 --> 03:09:59.750]  They're arresting folks videotaping police from their own houses.
[03:09:59.750 --> 03:10:02.652]  We've got to get control of our political employees.
[03:10:03.754 --> 03:10:05.015]  And let them know that we're the boss.
[03:10:05.015 --> 03:10:07.999]  So there's a real attempt to bring in tyranny.
[03:10:07.999 --> 03:10:18.313]  That's the system's answer to, hey, we screwed up everything and robbed everything, and now it's time for you to go along with that and let us take over even more of your life.
[03:10:18.313 --> 03:10:19.614]  We've got to say no.
[03:10:20.816 --> 03:10:22.798]  We've got to get to that point.
[03:10:22.798 --> 03:10:28.343]  Gold heads for fifth weekly advance on U.S.-European debt woes.
[03:10:28.343 --> 03:10:31.346]  It exploded, I don't know, 80-something bucks the last few weeks.
[03:10:31.346 --> 03:10:35.349]  Then they drove it down 15 bucks, then it surged right back up to where it was.
[03:10:36.750 --> 03:10:38.191]  Uh, a lot of stuff's happening there.
[03:10:38.191 --> 03:10:41.552]  The Chinese are saying, look, your debt ceiling's a disaster.
[03:10:41.552 --> 03:10:43.873]  Uh, this whole thing's going down.
[03:10:43.873 --> 03:10:46.314]  Uh, Ron Paul's pointed that out.
[03:10:46.314 --> 03:10:50.816]  We've got, we've now got a super creepy Congress that's totally unconstitutional.
[03:10:50.816 --> 03:10:53.898]  Ted Anderson, I'm bringing you in here, owner of the network and of, uh,
[03:10:54.858 --> 03:10:55.658]  Yeah, right here Alex.
[03:10:55.658 --> 03:10:59.720]  I can tell you right now, gold hit a high today of $1668.20 and of course higher than that in the futures market.
[03:11:16.585 --> 03:11:20.648]  Silver today has hit a high of $39.65.
[03:11:20.648 --> 03:11:22.230]  Gold is the one that's running right now.
[03:11:22.230 --> 03:11:30.716]  The Europeans are dumping money into the system trying to stimulate their economies over there, and that money is running to gold right now.
[03:11:30.716 --> 03:11:31.817]  It's also running to U.S.
[03:11:31.817 --> 03:11:32.478]  Treasury bills.
[03:11:33.278 --> 03:11:41.580]  The yield on T-bills are going down and gold is going up like crazy and that's because there's just way too much printing going on.
[03:11:41.580 --> 03:11:44.741]  So we've had it here in the United States, now it's occurring in Europe.
[03:11:44.741 --> 03:11:48.402]  The Asians are looking at it and they're just trying to run away from it.
[03:11:48.402 --> 03:11:49.923]  I was in Singapore here just about...
[03:11:50.819 --> 03:11:57.662]  Three weeks ago, four weeks ago, and their gold shops are just packed with people trying to buy 24 karat gold.
[03:11:57.662 --> 03:11:58.063]  Sure.
[03:11:58.063 --> 03:12:01.664]  Globally, the G20 is devaluing all currencies.
[03:12:01.664 --> 03:12:09.088]  There's only one or two sovereign countries and their currencies are actually going up or holding steady and gold is not up in those countries, like Switzerland.
[03:12:09.088 --> 03:12:13.490]  But Ted, I mean, I want to simplify this for folks and get your take and Bob's take on it.
[03:12:13.490 --> 03:12:14.631]  It's very simple.
[03:12:14.631 --> 03:12:16.112]  People ask what's happening in the economy.
[03:12:16.912 --> 03:12:17.872]  Okay.
[03:12:17.872 --> 03:12:28.014]  They are trying to depress the real economy so that their hyper-printing of currencies doesn't cause hyperinflation.
[03:12:28.014 --> 03:12:35.435]  But you're still getting the inflation in the commodities because that's sold globally and is being bought by big players.
[03:12:35.435 --> 03:12:37.516]  And so you're getting the worst of two worlds.
[03:12:37.516 --> 03:12:44.317]  But from the establishment's perspective, make everybody poor while they, quote, hoard the cash and buy real assets.
[03:12:44.317 --> 03:12:44.837]  Ted Anderson.
[03:12:45.350 --> 03:12:50.172]  Well, that's exactly what happened here during the TARP and all the bailouts that happened during the banking thing.
[03:12:50.172 --> 03:12:58.955]  I mean, we all heard Ron Paul say, man, if they put the money in the hands of the people, we'd have had $17,000 per person here in the United States.
[03:12:58.955 --> 03:13:08.919]  Instead, they handed it over to the globalists, these huge mega banks that were about ready to fail, and all of a sudden now they start dishing out these huge...
[03:13:09.699 --> 03:13:14.262]  Ted, that's the fake numbers of TARP being $800-something billion.
[03:13:14.262 --> 03:13:15.783]  In different ways they've gotten it.
[03:13:15.783 --> 03:13:17.484]  We haven't gotten new numbers in over a year.
[03:13:17.484 --> 03:13:19.685]  Ted, do you know how big it is?
[03:13:19.685 --> 03:13:26.529]  Because a year ago, Bob, it was $27 trillion, Bloomberg said, that the banks had gotten of our money, that we've got to pay them back in taxes.
[03:13:26.529 --> 03:13:29.831]  Yeah, we give them the money and then pay taxes to give them the money.
[03:13:29.831 --> 03:13:34.894]  Do we have any idea in the last year how much that's gone up, Bob, because they're keeping their traps shut?
[03:13:34.894 --> 03:13:37.175]  Well, the GAO the other day said it was $16.1 trillion.
[03:13:38.974 --> 03:13:40.075]  Which included U.S.
[03:13:40.075 --> 03:13:42.076]  as well as European banks.
[03:13:42.076 --> 03:13:44.658]  And I had projected $13.8 trillion.
[03:13:44.658 --> 03:13:46.139]  But that was the secret loan.
[03:13:46.139 --> 03:13:47.220]  Three years ago.
[03:13:47.220 --> 03:13:51.123]  Well then how does Bloomberg say $27 trillion then?
[03:13:51.123 --> 03:13:52.764]  I don't know.
[03:13:52.764 --> 03:13:58.068]  I've not seen the figure as yet and I would want to break down.
[03:13:58.068 --> 03:13:59.890]  Well sure, I mean it's old.
[03:13:59.890 --> 03:14:03.753]  At first they said $27.3, you remember that headline?
[03:14:03.753 --> 03:14:06.775]  And then there was another $5 trillion or so later they announced.
[03:14:06.775 --> 03:14:07.796]  But I guess that was total.
[03:14:09.474 --> 03:14:12.476]  I mean, all the different ways they get money.
[03:14:12.476 --> 03:14:14.017]  Could be.
[03:14:14.017 --> 03:14:22.083]  You know, and Bloomberg's part of the problem, except when they make the mistake of asking the Fed where all the money went.
[03:14:22.083 --> 03:14:26.846]  But I think it's just a straight up mistake.
[03:14:26.846 --> 03:14:30.148]  Or they didn't explain where that figure came from.
[03:14:30.148 --> 03:14:31.769]  But that's okay.
[03:14:31.769 --> 03:14:34.151]  And the bottom line is, it's a lot of money.
[03:14:35.505 --> 03:14:45.516]  A gross a lot of money and so we don't even know whether we got it back because the GAO didn't tell us that and so we may have gotten none of it back.
[03:14:46.764 --> 03:14:48.745]  Absolutely.
[03:14:48.745 --> 03:14:54.289]  And you know, in the TARP funds, we still know that there's money that has to come back.
[03:14:54.289 --> 03:15:01.174]  Some came back, probably, I'll guess $600 billion.
[03:15:01.174 --> 03:15:05.377]  So there's $250 billion still wandering around just in that program alone.
[03:15:05.377 --> 03:15:08.379]  But there's so many programs that we don't know anything about.
[03:15:08.379 --> 03:15:12.762]  And then they have all these swap agreements between the Fed and other central banks.
[03:15:13.522 --> 03:15:15.024]  And none of that's figured in.
[03:15:15.024 --> 03:15:33.423]  And if you look over on the left-hand side, you'll see $1.4 quadrillion worth of derivatives, of which, in the United States, about 83% has been written by JPMorgan Chase, who's a major shareholder in the Federal Reserve.
[03:15:35.472 --> 03:15:37.174]  Ted Anderson, there's no end to this.
[03:15:37.174 --> 03:15:44.120]  I want to go to phone calls, but obviously we have some silver and gold deals from when Ted bought silver and gold when it was lower.
[03:15:44.120 --> 03:15:45.582]  He can now pass those savings on.
[03:15:45.582 --> 03:15:49.886]  They're not as good as they were two months ago because he sold out of the stuff then, but it's continued to go up.
[03:15:49.886 --> 03:15:53.529]  So this is a win-win-win because Ted doesn't go up in prices.
[03:15:53.529 --> 03:15:57.373]  Even when gold and silver goes up, he sells what he had at the lower price.
[03:15:57.973 --> 03:16:01.356]  Even though it's higher, and that's why he's so incredibly competitive.
[03:16:01.356 --> 03:16:11.863]  But before we plug that and give folks today's offer, and it will go up next week, Ted's told me if prices continue like this, so I take advantage of it today and throughout the weekend, brokers will be there.
[03:16:11.863 --> 03:16:16.086]  But Bob Chapman, what do you expect to happen to gold by the fall now?
[03:16:16.086 --> 03:16:23.852]  Even a normal doldrum time, like the middle of summer or latter summer, the prices are exploding right now.
[03:16:25.459 --> 03:16:41.874]  I think technically we're looking at $17.50 by the end of the month and that's a stretch but that's what we're looking at during supposedly the weakest part of the year and people always forget that jewelry manufacturers throughout the world
[03:16:42.455 --> 03:16:42.655]  I think?
[03:17:01.776 --> 03:17:07.261]  And things go bonkers in the last quarter, which they could very well be going that way.
[03:17:07.261 --> 03:17:10.844]  We've had horrible experience just recently in the American market.
[03:17:10.844 --> 03:17:12.205]  And then we look over to Europe.
[03:17:12.205 --> 03:17:12.746]  It's bad.
[03:17:12.746 --> 03:17:15.809]  And they really don't have an agreement.
[03:17:15.809 --> 03:17:21.534]  Because the people in Germany and Holland and Finland, they say, no, we don't want to do that.
[03:17:22.654 --> 03:17:30.626]  And the head of the European Central Bank and others within that banking structure are saying, no, no, we have to have the money.
[03:17:30.626 --> 03:17:31.807]  We have to give the money.
[03:17:31.807 --> 03:17:33.870]  We can't let the string collapse.
[03:17:33.870 --> 03:17:36.053]  We can't lose the euro.
[03:17:36.053 --> 03:17:39.018]  We can't lose the European Union.
[03:17:40.054 --> 03:17:40.434]  Absolutely.
[03:17:40.434 --> 03:17:43.015]  Ted Anderson, your view on what Bob just said?
[03:18:00.202 --> 03:18:01.623]  Well, he's exactly right.
[03:18:01.623 --> 03:18:11.171]  And Colin Roberts of Chicago's Northern Trust Corporation is saying that it's a clear-cut panic in the markets right now.
[03:18:11.171 --> 03:18:13.033]  And that's what they're reporting.
[03:18:13.033 --> 03:18:14.834]  I mean, there is so much going on, Alex.
[03:18:14.834 --> 03:18:17.257]  You've got to realize, Europe is melting apart.
[03:18:17.257 --> 03:18:19.859]  The United States is melting.
[03:18:19.859 --> 03:18:21.900]  You've got Asia falling apart.
[03:18:21.900 --> 03:18:26.044]  There is a shortage right now in silver coins and gold coins in the marketplace.
[03:18:26.084 --> 03:18:31.673]  Well it's not Bob Chapman or Alex Jones or Ted Anderson three years ago saying the Euro would collapse.
[03:18:31.673 --> 03:18:34.618]  Now it's all over the news every day.
[03:18:34.618 --> 03:18:37.001]  Now the New York Times is admitting we're in a depression.
[03:18:37.001 --> 03:18:39.065]  I mean they've known all along.
[03:18:39.065 --> 03:18:39.585]  Continue Ted.
[03:18:40.350 --> 03:18:41.150]  Well, that's just it.
[03:18:41.150 --> 03:18:48.514]  I mean, that's just, just this last spring, it was so hard to get silver that it was almost impossible to get silver eagles.
[03:18:48.514 --> 03:18:49.094]  The U.S.
[03:18:49.094 --> 03:18:50.054]  Mint quit making them.
[03:18:50.054 --> 03:18:51.775]  There wasn't enough to go around.
[03:18:51.775 --> 03:18:57.317]  I would, I would try to buy 60,000 silver eagles from a dealer and find out that I only can get 10.
[03:18:57.317 --> 03:19:04.180]  And then after, I mean, I'd call all over the place just to try to keep enough supply on hand so I could meet the demand for my customers.
[03:19:04.180 --> 03:19:08.823]  You've got to realize I'm not the only gold dealer in the United States or in the world.
[03:19:08.823 --> 03:19:09.903]  I mean, they're all over the place.
[03:19:10.103 --> 03:19:15.989]  We know, it's admitted, most of them are actually taking orders and then trying to find it later.
[03:19:15.989 --> 03:19:21.474]  You, everything you've got is down at a bank in a vault and is shipped out every day as the orders come in.
[03:19:21.474 --> 03:19:21.954]  Correct, Ted?
[03:19:21.954 --> 03:19:22.775]  You've got it on hand.
[03:19:23.174 --> 03:19:26.276]  Yeah, we've got most everything on hand.
[03:19:26.276 --> 03:19:30.619]  I mean, every now and then we might end up short, but I can tell you, Alex, I'm out there buying all the time.
[03:19:30.619 --> 03:19:36.843]  I mean, that's the challenge right now, not finding customers to buy this stuff.
[03:19:36.843 --> 03:19:39.845]  People are going to be really sadly mistaken.
[03:19:39.845 --> 03:19:41.506]  Oh yeah, that's what you told me.
[03:19:41.506 --> 03:19:48.530]  In fact, off record, Ted's like, Alex, I'm having to buy gold three months out just to even get it in silver.
[03:19:48.530 --> 03:19:49.851]  It's horrible.
[03:19:49.851 --> 03:19:51.152]  Oh, I wish there'd be a dip.
[03:19:52.352 --> 03:19:58.817]  So yeah, and if you're one of the biggest brokers in the country now, I'm with the fifth biggest, imagine all these little guys around there.
[03:19:58.817 --> 03:20:01.659]  Ladies and gentlemen, go with Midas Resources.
[03:20:01.659 --> 03:20:09.725]  Ted, tell Bob, and then we're also going to plug the newsletter, because that's another smoking deal and valuable info.
[03:20:09.725 --> 03:20:11.146]  You get two silver dollars.
[03:20:11.846 --> 03:20:20.333]  Free shipping, a free film, the American Dream, great animated special on the banking system, and Mark Dice's powerful full-length book.
[03:20:20.333 --> 03:20:23.175]  And here it is, it's a big book and great read.
[03:20:23.175 --> 03:20:25.757]  Big Brother, The Orwellian Nightmare Come True.
[03:20:25.757 --> 03:20:27.339]  How much are the silver dollars now, Ted?
[03:20:27.796 --> 03:20:31.119]  Well, right now, that whole package is at $88 delivered.
[03:20:31.119 --> 03:20:35.002]  Okay, so you notice a couple days ago it was $85, but it's still an incredible deal.
[03:20:35.002 --> 03:20:36.623]  It's gonna keep going up, folks.
[03:20:36.623 --> 03:20:40.586]  Just a month or so ago, this thing was $70.
[03:20:40.586 --> 03:20:45.169]  Okay, $88, that's the free shipping, the free book, the free video, and two silver dollars.
[03:20:45.169 --> 03:20:46.190]  Is that a good deal?
[03:20:46.190 --> 03:20:51.114]  Two silver dollars, $88, a free book, film, and shipping, Bob Chapman?
[03:20:54.437 --> 03:20:54.898]  What'd you say?
[03:20:54.898 --> 03:20:56.641]  It's fantastic!
[03:20:56.641 --> 03:20:57.443]  It's wonderful!
[03:20:57.443 --> 03:20:58.906]  I mean, what's the retail on it? $150?
[03:21:00.697 --> 03:21:03.198]  Yeah, something like that.
[03:21:03.198 --> 03:21:08.641]  The point is, Alex, first of all, you sent us a truckload of this stuff.
[03:21:08.641 --> 03:21:10.302]  We had to reorder it for you.
[03:21:10.302 --> 03:21:12.803]  Those videos are getting in the hands of people.
[03:21:12.803 --> 03:21:14.023]  They're handing them off.
[03:21:14.023 --> 03:21:15.304]  People are understanding now.
[03:21:15.304 --> 03:21:19.426]  They're learning about the Federal Reserve System, the way the money comes into existence.
[03:21:19.426 --> 03:21:21.707]  This information is critical to have.
[03:21:21.707 --> 03:21:28.030]  The neat part about it is that there's a whole army of people out there now that have two silver dollars apiece.
[03:21:28.550 --> 03:21:44.354]  And those two silver dollars could mean the difference between eating in a week's time and not, because we're having an economic crisis, you'll need silver, you might as well get the stuff anyways, and then by gosh, take that video, watch it yourself, find a friend, find a family member,
[03:21:44.674 --> 03:21:46.595]  Hand it to them and say, you watch it too.
[03:21:46.595 --> 03:21:48.435]  When you're done with it, pass it on.
[03:21:48.435 --> 03:21:51.216]  Because that's what's going to save this country.
[03:21:51.216 --> 03:21:54.717]  We the people have to stand up and fight for it.
[03:21:54.717 --> 03:21:58.719]  And you're not going to even know how to fight for it if you don't understand what's getting you.
[03:21:58.719 --> 03:22:04.121]  The system is eating us alive and we need a tool to get out there and spread the word.
[03:22:04.121 --> 03:22:07.262]  And that American Dream video is the tool that works.
[03:22:07.262 --> 03:22:10.043]  I mean, believe me, it's entertaining, it's riveting.
[03:22:10.043 --> 03:22:11.763]  People watch it, they know what's going on.
[03:22:11.763 --> 03:22:13.964]  By the time they're done, they want to do something.
[03:22:14.284 --> 03:22:19.650]  Yeah, this is, it's only like a 35 minute film and it's animated South Park style.
[03:22:19.650 --> 03:22:23.354]  It's slightly racy, but even 10 year olds can watch it.
[03:22:23.354 --> 03:22:29.321]  I don't know if I'd let my 9 year old watch it, but the point is, is that it's really great and so is the book.
[03:22:29.321 --> 03:22:29.781]  800-686-2237.
[03:22:29.781 --> 03:22:29.841]  1-800-686-2237.
[03:22:35.788 --> 03:22:37.529]  Well, I mean, look how gold is doing, Alex.
[03:22:37.529 --> 03:22:38.449]  I mean, we've seen $1,688 an ounce.
[03:22:38.449 --> 03:22:39.110]  Bob is saying $1,750.
[03:22:39.110 --> 03:22:40.870]  My goodness, that's just right around the corner knocking.
[03:22:40.870 --> 03:22:41.991]  Well, we were crazy to say it would be $1,000.
[03:22:41.991 --> 03:22:43.071]  Then we were crazy to say $1,500.
[03:23:02.501 --> 03:23:05.403]  Now 2,000 seems reachable.
[03:23:05.403 --> 03:23:07.825]  And again, it's all dollar devaluation.
[03:23:07.825 --> 03:23:08.445]  800-686-2237.
[03:23:08.445 --> 03:23:14.230]  I'd like to say support the network, support the show, but this is a lost leader.
[03:23:14.230 --> 03:23:16.472]  Ted's, well, pretty competitive.
[03:23:16.472 --> 03:23:17.373]  He's certainly not a commie.
[03:23:17.793 --> 03:23:19.414]  Well, I can tell you one thing for sure.
[03:23:19.414 --> 03:23:23.255]  You're not going to find a deal like this anywhere out there, period.
[03:23:23.255 --> 03:23:25.376]  There's nobody offering it like this.
[03:23:25.376 --> 03:23:26.916]  Tell folks about the Forecaster, too.
[03:23:26.916 --> 03:23:27.897]  That's another smoking gun.
[03:23:27.897 --> 03:23:29.257]  Well, I mean, that's another thing.
[03:23:29.257 --> 03:23:32.658]  I mean, if you take a look, you buy one franc for $362, the Forecaster's $159 per year.
[03:23:32.658 --> 03:23:34.819]  It figures out to be about $965 per ounce, and gold right now is closer to $1,700.
[03:23:45.023 --> 03:23:48.064]  So it's such a great buy to be able to get in there.
[03:23:48.064 --> 03:23:54.166]  And then you get Bob's newsletter, which is just, you know, 40 pages packed with information.
[03:23:54.166 --> 03:23:58.148]  The economy right now with where it's going, people think that they can wait.
[03:23:58.148 --> 03:24:00.349]  And that's the point that I was trying to make before.
[03:24:00.349 --> 03:24:12.313]  If you think that you can wait till things completely melt down, and then you're going to turn around and try to find gold and silver at some local coin shop, or perhaps not even Midas Resources, there's just not enough supply.
[03:24:12.313 --> 03:24:14.034]  When everything melts apart,
[03:24:14.614 --> 03:24:19.899]  There's going to be such a rush into gold and silver, there's not going to be enough to cover orders.
[03:24:19.899 --> 03:24:22.542]  That's just raw reality.
[03:24:22.542 --> 03:24:26.926]  Right now we're dealing with about 1.5% of the people getting into gold and silver.
[03:24:26.926 --> 03:24:29.268]  If that number jumps to 10, we're toast.
[03:24:29.268 --> 03:24:30.430]  There isn't going to be enough there.
[03:24:31.346 --> 03:24:32.587]  Absolutely.
[03:24:32.587 --> 03:24:37.551]  Ladies and gentlemen, I got into gold when it was, Ted reminded me of the numbers, $250.
[03:24:37.551 --> 03:24:39.173]  I keep saying $300.
[03:24:39.173 --> 03:24:42.395]  I got into silver when it was $5 an ounce.
[03:24:42.395 --> 03:24:45.798]  And I still buy gold and silver where it's at today.
[03:24:45.798 --> 03:24:46.859]  And you know what?
[03:24:46.859 --> 03:24:49.621]  When they knock it down and play their games, I don't sell it.
[03:24:49.621 --> 03:24:51.443]  It's an emergency backup.
[03:24:52.123 --> 03:24:55.285]  And there's a whole list of great silver and gold deals they've got.
[03:24:55.285 --> 03:24:56.846]  It's the radio specials.
[03:24:56.846 --> 03:25:01.389]  His normal deals are excellent as well, but the radio specials are the lost leaders.
[03:25:01.389 --> 03:25:02.950]  I've seen the sheets on these.
[03:25:02.950 --> 03:25:06.972]  Even though he bought it when it was lower, two to five percent is the markup.
[03:25:06.972 --> 03:25:13.456]  With a guy with a business and the brokers and the taxes and all of it, Ted is extremely, extremely competitive.
[03:25:14.176 --> 03:25:18.819]  And then when you add that the stuff's gone up, you're getting this lower than you can find it anywhere else.
[03:25:18.819 --> 03:25:25.524]  You might be able to find somebody in the super hot market who bought it when it was low and is being competitive, but good luck.
[03:25:25.524 --> 03:25:29.546]  TED is a place that does this every day, day in, day out.
[03:25:29.546 --> 03:25:31.568]  Ask for the International Forecaster Special.
[03:25:32.668 --> 03:25:34.850]  Ask for the American Dream special.
[03:25:34.850 --> 03:25:39.853]  There's some other video specials we have there when you call to get even more silver dollars or gold coins.
[03:25:39.853 --> 03:25:42.094]  Just ask about all the specials.
[03:25:42.094 --> 03:25:43.975]  800-686-2237.
[03:25:43.975 --> 03:25:44.916]  800-686-2237.
[03:25:44.916 --> 03:25:55.222]  I would not be up here saying, buy silver and gold, if I did not every bone in my body think it's going to go way up because of common sense.
[03:25:55.222 --> 03:25:56.883]  And I've been right for 11 years.
[03:25:56.883 --> 03:25:59.124]  And believe me, I would almost want to be wrong.
[03:25:59.124 --> 03:25:59.345]  In fact,
[03:26:00.245 --> 03:26:04.870]  Of course I want to be wrong, but I am kind of egotistical like everybody else.
[03:26:04.870 --> 03:26:15.320]  I wish they'd stop printing the money, fix the economies, start the tariffs, raise the interest rates, fix America and save it, and then have gold plunge and people be mad at me.
[03:26:16.260 --> 03:26:26.989]  Okay, because then we have a future and it's not going to be war on the streets and every piece of metal being torn off, graves and air conditioners and everything else and crime exploding and mobs beating people up.
[03:26:26.989 --> 03:26:33.934]  I would love to be wrong, but unfortunately, folks, the globalists are full steam ahead into the iceberg field.
[03:26:33.934 --> 03:26:36.216]  This is their plan to sink this republic.
[03:26:36.596 --> 03:26:40.519]  Okay, so they can make us jump on the USS New World Order.
[03:26:40.519 --> 03:26:43.101]  And so we're going to end up being right, again.
[03:26:43.101 --> 03:26:44.262]  Because they're not changing course.
[03:26:44.262 --> 03:26:47.884]  Now, if they started changing course, you'd see gold and silver start going down.
[03:26:47.884 --> 03:26:51.247]  And I don't mean for a month, I mean precipitously.
[03:26:51.247 --> 03:26:54.709]  But you don't see that, Bob Chapman.
[03:26:54.709 --> 03:26:58.993]  And the reason you don't see it is people all over the world, even more so,
[03:27:00.083 --> 03:27:02.984]  Then in the United States, of buying gold and silver.
[03:27:02.984 --> 03:27:15.630]  Arhus, which is outside Frankfurt, a large producer of ingots of gold and silver, said the other day that they cannot keep up with the domestic German demand alone.
[03:27:15.630 --> 03:27:18.211]  I mean, that's dynamite.
[03:27:18.211 --> 03:27:24.294]  And we're getting stories in the forecaster, letters from people, that
[03:27:25.777 --> 03:27:32.446]  In Athens, they're going bananas, buying gold and silver to get out of the Euro, get their money out of the bank.
[03:27:32.446 --> 03:27:38.874]  The same thing has happened in Lisbon and Puerto and places like that.
[03:27:38.874 --> 03:27:40.756]  The Americans haven't even woken up yet!
[03:27:41.897 --> 03:27:45.079]  8, 10 to 1% on gold and silver coins, bullion and shares?
[03:27:45.079 --> 03:27:46.019]  Forget it!
[03:27:46.019 --> 03:27:49.581]  I mean, what's gonna be like when it's 15%?
[03:27:49.581 --> 03:27:52.743]  Will gold be $10,000 to $15,000 an ounce?
[03:27:52.743 --> 03:27:56.504]  Or will silver be perhaps $1,000 to $2,000 an ounce?
[03:27:56.504 --> 03:27:58.826]  Probably.
[03:27:58.826 --> 03:27:59.426]  Absolutely.
[03:27:59.426 --> 03:28:02.187]  Gentlemen, I promise to go to calls.
[03:28:02.187 --> 03:28:05.769]  Let's just do one more segment after this, okay?
[03:28:05.769 --> 03:28:06.709]  I'll do it.
[03:28:06.709 --> 03:28:07.310]  Ted, are you good?
[03:28:08.260 --> 03:28:09.001]  I'll be here.
[03:28:09.001 --> 03:28:13.588]  We're gonna come back, take one segment of calls, hit a few other news items for everybody that's patiently holding.
[03:28:13.588 --> 03:28:18.055]  But before we go any further, Ted, I keep getting calls here at the office asking me about the other specials.
[03:28:18.055 --> 03:28:19.177]  They want me to list them.
[03:28:19.177 --> 03:28:21.381]  Explain the International Forecaster Special.
[03:28:22.372 --> 03:28:25.035]  Yeah, International Forecaster comes with the Frank coin.
[03:28:25.035 --> 03:28:27.378]  The Frank coin is a European coin.
[03:28:27.378 --> 03:28:31.203]  It contains approximately one-fifth of an ounce of gold.
[03:28:31.203 --> 03:28:37.190]  And so if you pick up one of those coins, you're going to be able to buy that coin and you'll get a full year subscription to Bob's newsletter.
[03:28:37.190 --> 03:28:38.812]  Now you can buy the newsletter straight up.
[03:28:38.812 --> 03:28:38.932]  It's $159.
[03:28:40.714 --> 03:28:42.135]  But we'll give it to you for free.
[03:28:42.135 --> 03:28:45.117]  Might as well buy the subscription if you buy the Frank coin.
[03:28:45.117 --> 03:28:46.678]  I think that's such a great deal.
[03:28:46.678 --> 03:28:48.800]  Something we've been offering for a long time.
[03:28:48.800 --> 03:28:54.223]  And considerably, people were buying the same thing for about $96 when we first started.
[03:28:54.223 --> 03:28:55.124]  And now it's $362 to give you an idea.
[03:28:55.124 --> 03:28:56.104]  And by the way, Ted, going further...
[03:29:00.207 --> 03:29:02.669]  I happen to know you are paying, Bob, for these subscriptions.
[03:29:02.669 --> 03:29:06.611]  They're twice a week digital, or what is it, once a week, I forget, hard copy.
[03:29:06.611 --> 03:29:08.572]  I always read the digital one.
[03:29:08.572 --> 03:29:10.333]  And it really is invaluable info.
[03:29:10.333 --> 03:29:14.395]  I mean, this is thick, important, wide-spectrum information.
[03:29:14.395 --> 03:29:19.458]  But if I'm, correct me if I'm wrong, it's already a very competitive deal on that franc by itself.
[03:29:19.458 --> 03:29:23.661]  It's not like you're paying more for a franc and then getting the newsletter.
[03:29:23.661 --> 03:29:24.981]  Tell folks how much the franc is.
[03:29:24.981 --> 03:29:25.582]  How much is the deal?
[03:29:26.309 --> 03:29:30.335]  $362 and you're gonna pay that for a Frank one way or the other?
[03:29:30.335 --> 03:29:32.998]  Bob, how good of a deal is that on a Frank just by itself?
[03:29:34.141 --> 03:29:35.081]  Well, that's terrific.
[03:29:35.081 --> 03:29:37.282]  It's right in line with the market.
[03:29:37.282 --> 03:29:41.823]  And Ted's prices are excellent in the bullion coins.
[03:29:41.823 --> 03:29:43.804]  He can compete with anybody in the country.
[03:29:43.804 --> 03:29:45.404]  Absolutely, folks.
[03:29:45.404 --> 03:29:47.545]  800-686-2237.
[03:29:47.545 --> 03:29:49.685]  I feel good pushing minus resources.
[03:29:49.685 --> 03:29:50.846]  Get your gold and silver today.
[03:29:50.846 --> 03:29:51.966]  Call's coming up.
[03:29:51.966 --> 03:29:53.366]  We're on the march.
[03:29:53.366 --> 03:29:54.987]  The empire's on the run.
[03:29:54.987 --> 03:29:58.568]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[03:30:02.307 --> 03:30:04.108]  Take the first step in home security.
[03:30:04.108 --> 03:30:05.529]  Install the Door Sentinel.
[03:30:05.529 --> 03:30:08.972]  Standard locks, deadbolts, and security systems can't prevent forced entry.
[03:30:08.972 --> 03:30:13.435]  The Door Sentinel provides door kick-in protection and can be added to your existing security system.
[03:30:13.435 --> 03:30:17.117]  The Door Sentinel is easy to install and will turn your home into a fortress.
[03:30:17.117 --> 03:30:17.698]  Make the call.
[03:30:17.698 --> 03:30:17.918]  678-648-6757.
[03:30:17.918 --> 03:30:18.158]  That's 678-648-6757.
[03:30:18.158 --> 03:30:20.059]  Or visit them at S-E-N-T-I-N-E-L securitygroup.com.
[03:30:20.059 --> 03:30:21.260]  SentinelSecurityGroup.com.
[03:30:31.607 --> 03:30:40.933]  We the people grow cotton, weave fabric, engrave ink, embed strips and fibers to protect from counterfeit, then carting to a private bank, having it led back at interest, forcing taxes to service debt.
[03:30:40.933 --> 03:30:41.734]  This capitalism?
[03:30:41.734 --> 03:30:47.998]  Or was Jefferson correct when stating a central bank issuing the public currency is a greater menace to the liberties of the people than a standing army?
[03:30:47.998 --> 03:30:48.799]  Hi, Ted Anderson.
[03:30:48.799 --> 03:30:51.961]  I'm placing a free silver dollar in a book that explains our monetary system.
[03:30:51.961 --> 03:30:52.901]  Call for your copy 800-686-2237.
[03:30:52.901 --> 03:30:53.962]  It's time to understand the system.
[03:30:53.962 --> 03:30:54.282]  Call 800-686-2237.
[03:30:54.282 --> 03:30:54.622]  That's 800-686-2237.
[03:31:01.787 --> 03:31:07.633]  There are limitless ways to go into business for yourself, but most involve substantial capital and risk.
[03:31:07.633 --> 03:31:10.857]  Our InfoWarsTeam.com operation is different.
[03:31:10.857 --> 03:31:22.169]  We promote premium quality health, energy and skincare products using dynamic, caring personalities and state-of-the-art media technology to spread a powerful message of health.

[03:31:32.255 --> 03:31:34.656]  It is you that defines the reward level.
[03:31:34.656 --> 03:31:41.841]  Whether you are seeking a few hundred extra dollars per month or a six or even seven figure annual income, it's up to you.
[03:31:41.841 --> 03:31:42.861]  Want to find out more?
[03:31:42.861 --> 03:31:49.245]  Shoot an email with InfoWars Team in the subject line to InfoWars Team Coordinator, MZ, and tell him a little bit about yourself.
[03:31:49.505 --> 03:31:52.250]  That's the initials MZ and Infowarsteam.com.
[03:31:52.250 --> 03:31:54.654]  That's MZ and Infowarsteam.com.
[03:31:54.654 --> 03:31:58.662]  I only promote products that I truly believe in, and these are phenomenal.
[03:31:58.662 --> 03:32:00.685]  Whatever you do, visit Infowarsteam.com.
[03:32:02.935 --> 03:32:04.777]  Hey Bill, pick up line 3, it's Brian.
[03:32:04.777 --> 03:32:05.958]  Hey Brian, what's up?
[03:32:05.958 --> 03:32:06.459]  Brian here.
[03:32:06.459 --> 03:32:07.200]  Thanks.
[03:32:07.200 --> 03:32:12.625]  Hey Bill, I just received my shipment of the Safety Net, our full-year emergency food system.
[03:32:12.625 --> 03:32:20.514]  I can't tell you how great it feels to personally not have to worry anymore, especially with the growing threats to our everyday food supply.
[03:32:20.714 --> 03:32:30.781]  Brian, not only are you getting 4,320 nutritionally dense, delicious food servings, but the individual serving price is just $1.43 per meal.
[03:32:30.781 --> 03:32:33.643]  It's truly great tasting food at amazing prices.
[03:32:33.643 --> 03:32:36.165]  The variety is also a huge bonus, Bill.
[03:32:36.165 --> 03:32:39.547]  It's like having access to a full menu of impressive food.
[03:32:39.547 --> 03:32:44.931]  Well, it really is a safety net for those worried about the coming food shortages and how their families can prepare.
[03:32:45.231 --> 03:32:49.613]  It's great knowing I'm covered for the future, but I gotta go, Bill, and get all this food unloaded.
[03:32:49.613 --> 03:32:51.774]  With scorching heat, devastating U.S.
[03:32:51.774 --> 03:32:56.115]  cropland, there's never been a better time to visit safetynetsavings.com.
[03:32:56.115 --> 03:32:58.416]  That's safetynetsavings.com.
[03:32:58.416 --> 03:33:08.220]  Visit safetynetsavings.com today.
[03:33:08.220 --> 03:33:10.341]  Big Brother.
[03:33:10.341 --> 03:33:13.142]  Mainstream Media.
[03:33:13.142 --> 03:33:14.223]  Government Cover-Ups.
[03:33:15.666 --> 03:33:17.627]  You want answers?
[03:33:17.627 --> 03:33:19.549]  Well, so does he.
[03:33:19.549 --> 03:33:30.316]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[03:33:30.316 --> 03:33:35.579]  I'm on InfoWars.com and I'm looking at the link on the front page.
[03:33:36.949 --> 03:33:40.951]  To last night's InfoWars.com special report.
[03:33:40.951 --> 03:33:43.012]  It's not the nightly TV show.
[03:33:43.012 --> 03:33:45.213]  That's InfoWars Nightly News.
[03:33:45.213 --> 03:33:51.575]  Starting September 1st, five nights a week, seven o'clock, 30 minutes, hard-hitting, focused.
[03:33:51.575 --> 03:33:53.396]  It's not even the same studio look.
[03:33:53.396 --> 03:33:57.258]  This is the nightly news look, and we're still getting the lighting and graphics and everything together.
[03:33:57.258 --> 03:34:04.140]  It's really a beta testing, but we're going to have the nightly news reports as well, and that's why your membership's at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[03:34:06.161 --> 03:34:08.062]  And buying the books, the videos, all of it.
[03:34:08.062 --> 03:34:09.122]  That funds what we're doing.
[03:34:09.122 --> 03:34:11.543]  We're not funded with banker bailout money.
[03:34:11.543 --> 03:34:14.084]  I want to remind people of this.
[03:34:14.084 --> 03:34:22.708]  Hundreds of millions of dollars of the trillions are confirmed as of four months ago to have gone directly to MSNBC.
[03:34:22.708 --> 03:34:31.752]  When Rachel Maddow gets out there and demonizes the Founding Fathers, the Second Amendment, Ron Paul, she is paid by the Federal Reserve with U.S.
[03:34:31.752 --> 03:34:33.713]  taxpayer money to do it.
[03:34:33.713 --> 03:34:35.154]  We're not funded by them.
[03:34:36.095 --> 03:34:37.676]  Remember that!
[03:34:37.676 --> 03:34:39.758]  And so, I want to continue to expand.
[03:34:39.758 --> 03:34:43.861]  I mean, the more you fund us, the more energy we've got.
[03:34:43.861 --> 03:34:48.205]  That's all money is, is symbols of energy.
[03:34:48.205 --> 03:34:50.907]  That's all commodities are, unless you can eat them.
[03:34:50.907 --> 03:34:56.151]  And the point is, and I guess using gold and silver and manufacture, they are eaten, they're consumed.
[03:34:56.151 --> 03:34:56.932]  Point is, they're consumable.
[03:34:58.317 --> 03:35:01.601]  We have got, we have got to go to the next level and we're doing it.
[03:35:01.601 --> 03:35:04.685]  We're doing it, we're doing it, we're doing it because of your past support.
[03:35:04.685 --> 03:35:11.053]  And as we go into this depression, we're not hiding back and pulling in our, our, you know, feelers and better watch it.
[03:35:11.053 --> 03:35:12.895]  We're just like, you know what?
[03:35:12.895 --> 03:35:15.799]  I've got these reserves here for rainy day for this place.
[03:35:15.799 --> 03:35:17.441]  Spend them, boom, do the TV show.
[03:35:18.393 --> 03:35:19.515]  Build it and they will come.
[03:35:19.515 --> 03:35:20.536]  Boom!
[03:35:20.536 --> 03:35:22.099]  Use the reserves.
[03:35:22.099 --> 03:35:23.921]  And so we need to refill those reserves.
[03:35:23.921 --> 03:35:29.530]  So buy the books, the videos, the t-shirts, all of it at PrisonPlanet.tv membership.
[03:35:29.530 --> 03:35:30.611]  That's funny on YouTube.
[03:35:31.738 --> 03:35:33.920]  They will gripe on the very video.
[03:35:33.920 --> 03:35:36.461]  I can't believe he's charging for this!
[03:35:36.461 --> 03:35:49.371]  As the video, with like five crew members behind it, building rent, taxes, as they're watching the video that's streamed live on the subscriber site for free, they are in there complaining.
[03:35:49.591 --> 03:35:51.752]  And they're obviously trolls and operatives.
[03:35:51.752 --> 03:35:56.795]  Or they're people who are mentally ill and are living in their mother's basement and never live in the real world.
[03:35:56.795 --> 03:36:06.441]  And I will tell you, the reason to be a PrisonPlanet.tv member is because you get the streams first, you get the higher quality archives, and a lot of it is exclusive to PrisonPlanet.tv.
[03:36:06.441 --> 03:36:12.965]  And I'm not gonna just because of the trolls get angry and do what I normally do and just go, okay, none of it's free then.
[03:36:15.595 --> 03:36:17.277]  Again, these people don't live in the real world.
[03:36:17.277 --> 03:36:18.158]  I'm a capitalist.
[03:36:18.158 --> 03:36:18.979]  I'm free market.
[03:36:18.979 --> 03:36:21.822]  I want to be prosperous.
[03:36:21.822 --> 03:36:23.364]  There's nothing wrong with that.
[03:36:23.364 --> 03:36:25.687]  The bankers have taught us to be failures.
[03:36:25.687 --> 03:36:29.911]  That people fighting for justice are supposed to be homeless.
[03:36:29.911 --> 03:36:30.111]  No!
[03:36:30.712 --> 03:36:31.432]  No!
[03:36:31.432 --> 03:36:31.753]  No!
[03:36:31.753 --> 03:36:33.974]  We're not funded with your tax money.
[03:36:33.974 --> 03:36:39.077]  We're not funded with bailout money they stole from you, like George Soros and the rest of them.
[03:36:39.077 --> 03:36:39.697]  Okay?
[03:36:39.697 --> 03:36:45.920]  We're funded by people that support us and freely buy our books, our videos, our materials that are great deals.
[03:36:45.920 --> 03:36:48.642]  And we give good information that's helped people.
[03:36:48.642 --> 03:36:50.963]  And we've predicted accurately what's happened.
[03:36:50.963 --> 03:36:55.926]  And so I will tell folks again, buy the books, buy the videos, buy the PrisonPlanet.tv memberships.
[03:36:56.206 --> 03:37:03.532]  That's why, one reason I went into overdrive today was to take calls, but to also ask for your support if you believe in what we're doing here.
[03:37:03.532 --> 03:37:14.140]  Do you have any comments, Bob, on people that don't live in the real world, and even when you give them something free, then urinate on it and say that it's evil that you gave it to them?
[03:37:14.140 --> 03:37:16.822]  They'll always be with us, and they always have been.
[03:37:16.822 --> 03:37:19.965]  It takes all kinds of people to make up the world.
[03:37:20.812 --> 03:37:33.341]  And we have to overlook those things, keep the goals in sight, keep on doing what we're doing, and out of the whole, help those who are willing to accept help and not complain about it.
[03:37:33.341 --> 03:37:45.029]  But it's mentally ill to be on a YouTube channel and saying, I can't believe he should give these videos away for free while they're watching the video that we posted last night right after it streamed on PrisonPlanet.tv.
[03:37:45.029 --> 03:37:48.912]  I mean, it's, you think it's mental illness or are they COINTELPRO, Bob?
[03:37:50.194 --> 03:37:51.696]  Well, it could be both.
[03:37:51.696 --> 03:37:57.082]  But I think a lot of it is people just want something for nothing.
[03:37:57.082 --> 03:38:00.326]  But they're getting it for nothing and complaining.
[03:38:00.326 --> 03:38:00.867]  That's right.
[03:38:03.537 --> 03:38:12.862]  People are strange, and sometimes they spend their whole life being, quote, normal, and then they get strange, or vice versa.
[03:38:12.862 --> 03:38:14.923]  Today, you never know what you're going to get.
[03:38:14.923 --> 03:38:15.943]  Bob, you've said it before.
[03:38:15.943 --> 03:38:25.048]  When you're number one, and you've been number one in your field, Ted up there, number one in his alternative media field, I've been number one for a decade in what I do, and they're jealous.
[03:38:25.048 --> 03:38:25.888]  They're jealous.
[03:38:25.888 --> 03:38:26.969]  They burn within me.
[03:38:26.969 --> 03:38:27.529]  They sure are.
[03:38:27.529 --> 03:38:28.710]  And I hate that.
[03:38:28.710 --> 03:38:30.351]  I want to see them be winners as well.
[03:38:30.751 --> 03:38:37.919]  You know, these little jealous people can never get it together because they're too busy critiquing other people.
[03:38:37.919 --> 03:38:43.446]  And a lot of them don't have the equipment, too, and they feel badly about that.
[03:38:43.446 --> 03:38:45.628]  But that's just the way life is.
[03:38:45.628 --> 03:38:47.931]  Some people are given gifts and some people aren't.
[03:38:49.073 --> 03:38:50.814]  Yeah, well I shouldn't even be complaining about it.
[03:38:50.814 --> 03:39:03.562]  I just, it's a new level when they're watching the free video and complaining, or on my website where it's posted and complaining, and I just see it and they're like, he shouldn't have a subscription site, this should all be free, and there it is!
[03:39:03.562 --> 03:39:08.726]  It's people that subscribe to fund us so you idiots can see it for free!
[03:39:08.726 --> 03:39:10.567]  I just, I shouldn't even respond to it.
[03:39:11.167 --> 03:39:17.990]  It's definitely basement dwellers eating Hot Pockets and their mothers telling them, you know, to carry the trash out when they're 35.
[03:39:17.990 --> 03:39:24.973]  It just really gets to me sometimes because it's their critical thinking.
[03:39:24.973 --> 03:39:27.154]  Look, Bob, I don't think of myself as that smart.
[03:39:27.154 --> 03:39:33.117]  And then the more I live, the more I'm out there, I start figuring out I'm smart compared to a lot of people.
[03:39:33.117 --> 03:39:34.338]  People are really this dumb.
[03:39:34.838 --> 03:39:43.882]  And I guess that's what the globalists are using is the fact that they know a lot of people are dumbed down or not paying attention, and they use that against them, Bob.
[03:39:43.882 --> 03:39:45.922]  And that's absolutely correct.
[03:39:45.922 --> 03:39:49.984]  And that's why they think they can subdue us and enslave us.
[03:39:49.984 --> 03:39:51.525]  And I got news for them.
[03:39:51.525 --> 03:39:56.266]  There's just all kinds of people out there who are smarter than they are.
[03:39:56.266 --> 03:40:02.589]  And these masters of the universe like Soros and Brzezinski and Kissinger, they're all going to find out
[03:40:03.356 --> 03:40:05.277]  They weren't as smart as they thought they were.
[03:40:05.277 --> 03:40:07.098]  They're not.
[03:40:07.098 --> 03:40:09.899]  Ted Anderson, I want to go to Alan, Tim, Jeffrey, Dennis, and George.
[03:40:09.899 --> 03:40:12.560]  We're going to end this here in about 10 minutes, but I got to get to those calls.
[03:40:12.560 --> 03:40:14.401]  Do you have any comments on what I was just talking about?
[03:40:15.188 --> 03:40:24.797]  Well, you know that I've been in it for long enough to know, too, that there are people out there that expect something for nothing, and really, what they're contributing is nothing.
[03:40:24.797 --> 03:40:29.482]  And if you want to save your country, people gave their blood and their lives for this.
[03:40:29.482 --> 03:40:35.568]  It's a fight for our lives and our freedom and our liberty, and that means you have to give up something, my goodness.
[03:40:35.928 --> 03:40:37.169]  Of course they should finance it.
[03:40:37.169 --> 03:40:38.269]  They should be behind you 100%.
[03:40:38.269 --> 03:40:40.230]  And I see those comments.
[03:40:40.230 --> 03:40:47.294]  I mean, that's just, anytime there's an internet billboard, people think they can just put up a whole bunch of profanity and talk about how bad people are.
[03:40:47.294 --> 03:40:51.256]  That's just... Well, what it is, is it's losers that want up themselves.
[03:40:51.256 --> 03:40:54.398]  Oh, I can talk bad about the person who's in the arena.
[03:40:54.798 --> 03:40:54.938]  I don't
[03:41:13.294 --> 03:41:19.158]  They're so servile and petty and worm-like, I feel bad for them.
[03:41:19.158 --> 03:41:23.622]  I mean, it literally just blows my mind.
[03:41:23.622 --> 03:41:25.043]  Here it is crystallized.
[03:41:25.043 --> 03:41:32.248]  They're not mad at the IRS literally taking old people's houses and grabbing wedding rings off women's fingers.
[03:41:32.248 --> 03:41:35.271]  They're not mad at the big bankers and Warren Buffett.
[03:41:35.951 --> 03:41:43.214]  Destroying their own stock and not letting their folks know and getting bank or bailout while calling for higher taxes on the middle class so they can steal the money.
[03:41:43.214 --> 03:41:49.416]  They're not mad at Bill Gates calling to basically sterilize everybody and kill grandma with the death care, the death panels.
[03:41:49.416 --> 03:41:52.317]  They're not mad at the TSA sticking their hands down their pants.
[03:41:52.317 --> 03:41:57.399]  They're mad at those of us that are trying to rally people to stop evil.
[03:41:57.759 --> 03:42:07.584]  Even if you're jealous of us because we're real men, we have red blood, we're not scared, we're public, we don't use fake handles and fake names, that upsets you as cowards.
[03:42:07.584 --> 03:42:08.964]  I understand that.
[03:42:08.964 --> 03:42:16.728]  But at least you should want self-preservation and get out of the way so real men can go out and reach out to other real men and women that want freedom.
[03:42:17.048 --> 03:42:18.209]  You know, I said it before.
[03:42:18.209 --> 03:42:19.290]  Get out of the road.
[03:42:19.290 --> 03:42:20.370]  Get out of the way.
[03:42:20.370 --> 03:42:21.431]  Get out of my way.
[03:42:21.431 --> 03:42:22.292]  Get out of my way.
[03:42:22.292 --> 03:42:23.433]  Get out of my way.
[03:42:23.433 --> 03:42:30.178]  I'm tired of the pessimism and people that try to kill the messenger and who don't understand this is life and death.
[03:42:30.178 --> 03:42:33.460]  Final comment, Bob, on that and we're going to rampage through calls.
[03:42:33.460 --> 03:42:34.381]  You've covered it all.
[03:42:34.381 --> 03:42:35.482]  Let's go to the calls.
[03:42:35.482 --> 03:42:36.963]  Alright, here's the man in the arena thing.
[03:42:38.251 --> 03:42:39.131]  And then we'll go to the calls.
[03:42:39.131 --> 03:42:47.376]  The man in the arena, it is not the critic who counts, not the man who points out how the strong man stumbles, or where the doer of deeds could have done them better.
[03:42:47.376 --> 03:43:02.503]  The credit belongs to the man who is actually in the arena, whose face is marred by dust and sweat and blood, who strives valiantly, who errs, who errors, and who comes short again and again, because there is no effort without error and shortcoming.
[03:43:02.503 --> 03:43:05.485]  But who does actually strive to do the deeds,
[03:43:05.765 --> 03:43:24.433]  Who knows great enthusiasms, the great devotions, who spends himself in a worthy cause, who is at best knows in the end the triumph of high achievement, and at the worst, if he fails, at least fails while daring greatly, so that his place shall never be with those cold and timid souls who neither know victory nor defeat.
[03:43:24.433 --> 03:43:25.854]  Let's go to your calls.
[03:43:25.854 --> 03:43:27.655]  Allen and Florida, you're on the air, go ahead.
[03:43:29.079 --> 03:43:30.059]  Hi, Alex.
[03:43:30.059 --> 03:43:30.679]  My name's Alan.
[03:43:30.679 --> 03:43:31.500]  I'm in Florida.
[03:43:31.500 --> 03:43:36.781]  I was actually calling to try to get in touch with you several times, but it's kind of hard to get through sometimes.
[03:43:36.781 --> 03:43:42.042]  I was calling because I was wondering, how come you never had Jock Fresco on your show?
[03:43:42.042 --> 03:43:51.904]  Considering all the problems that we've been having seems to revolve around the monetary system, one of the good solutions that could come to fix things would be to
[03:43:52.424 --> 03:43:56.690]  Do away with the monetary system and switch to a resource-based economy.
[03:43:56.690 --> 03:44:01.216]  Now I know there are a lot of things on both sides... Okay, well let me stop you, let me stop you, let me stop you.
[03:44:01.216 --> 03:44:08.925]  I was just on YouTube during the break and saw the comments that I was talking about saying, why hasn't Alex talked about the guy beaten to death by cops?
[03:44:09.446 --> 03:44:11.026]  Because it's not in the video they're watching.
[03:44:11.026 --> 03:44:14.387]  I've talked about it 20 times the last couple weeks.
[03:44:14.387 --> 03:44:18.808]  I've tried to get Jacque Fresco on from Florida repeatedly.
[03:44:18.808 --> 03:44:32.191]  I've called His Imperial Highness because he draws pictures of the floating cities that are going to save us and the big brain computer that will decide and I'll be sent for re-education and the rest of it, to actually give us their side of it so I can understand what he's talking about.
[03:44:32.191 --> 03:44:38.192]  And then you call in and I can hear your voice, you know, kind of trimmulating, putting me on the spot for not getting him on.
[03:44:38.192 --> 03:44:38.952]  Why haven't I had
[03:44:39.352 --> 03:44:42.575]  I think it should necessarily be the mega-computer that runs it.
[03:44:42.575 --> 03:44:44.216]  But if you actually go into its research...
[03:45:03.416 --> 03:45:05.277]  No, no, it's not a split scene.
[03:45:05.277 --> 03:45:06.858]  Everybody has their own home.
[03:45:06.858 --> 03:45:09.380]  That's all covered in all of his research.
[03:45:09.380 --> 03:45:10.680]  Believe me, I've read it.
[03:45:10.680 --> 03:45:13.422]  I've read it and it's frighteningly authoritarian.
[03:45:13.422 --> 03:45:15.643]  Now, I don't think everybody involved in it's bad.
[03:45:15.643 --> 03:45:19.226]  I'd like to learn more and he's got an open invitation.
[03:45:19.226 --> 03:45:20.546]  And listen, I called up...
[03:45:21.787 --> 03:45:28.051]  I called up who's the Peter Joseph guy and I said, hey, I don't want to fight with you about two or three months ago.
[03:45:28.051 --> 03:45:28.991]  I said, why don't you come on?
[03:45:28.991 --> 03:45:29.592]  He said, oh, come on.
[03:45:29.592 --> 03:45:30.452]  Then he sent me a big thing.
[03:45:30.452 --> 03:45:31.693]  Well, you've got to say this was wrong.
[03:45:31.693 --> 03:45:32.273]  That was wrong.
[03:45:32.273 --> 03:45:33.074]  This was wrong.
[03:45:33.074 --> 03:45:37.597]  So I went and looked at what they've actually said and not and it was actually what they're saying a lot of it.
[03:45:37.597 --> 03:45:40.699]  I mean, he did say on the show that I would be sent for reeducation.
[03:45:40.699 --> 03:45:42.680]  And I said, that sounds like authoritarianism.
[03:45:42.680 --> 03:45:44.841]  And he said, well, you have to retract that that was said.
[03:45:44.841 --> 03:45:48.003]  And I and I can't retract something that was said.
[03:45:48.003 --> 03:45:49.164]  So, I mean,
[03:45:50.044 --> 03:45:50.725]  I've never heard of it.
[03:46:07.369 --> 03:46:15.993]  Yeah, I mean, I tried to put an olive branch out, but I mean, just people just like saying, you know, oh, it's great, we'll get rid of this monetary system.
[03:46:15.993 --> 03:46:21.075]  Great, get rid of it, but then I don't want to be under this all-powerful central system.
[03:46:21.075 --> 03:46:22.555]  See, I don't, I want to be free.
[03:46:22.555 --> 03:46:24.576]  I mean, you may even have a better system.
[03:46:24.576 --> 03:46:26.897]  I want to go out and be a caveman, okay?
[03:46:26.897 --> 03:46:28.518]  I just, I don't want to be domesticated.
[03:46:29.619 --> 03:46:32.582]  Even though you guys have got a great idea and I've got to live under it.
[03:46:32.582 --> 03:46:38.770]  I'd love to hear about it and try to be friendly about it, but it's not like... Okay, let's go to Tim in Michigan.
[03:46:38.770 --> 03:46:39.331]  Tim, you're on the air.
[03:46:39.331 --> 03:46:40.052]  We've got to move quick now.
[03:46:40.052 --> 03:46:41.374]  Go ahead, Tim.
[03:46:41.374 --> 03:46:42.115]  Alright, Alex.
[03:46:42.115 --> 03:46:43.496]  How you doing today, buddy?
[03:46:43.496 --> 03:46:43.717]  Good.
[03:46:43.717 --> 03:46:45.639]  This is the guy that came up with the idea of the Google bomb.
[03:46:45.639 --> 03:46:45.960]  Go ahead.
[03:46:46.491 --> 03:46:47.632]  Yeah, thank you, man.
[03:46:47.632 --> 03:46:48.092]  Thank you.
[03:46:48.092 --> 03:46:48.612]  I appreciate it.
[03:46:48.612 --> 03:46:50.573]  I heard you say that the other day on your show.
[03:46:50.573 --> 03:46:51.374]  I appreciate it.
[03:46:51.374 --> 03:46:55.196]  Yeah, we gotta move quick, because I waited and didn't get any calls.
[03:46:55.196 --> 03:47:02.820]  Okay, you mentioned something about, you know, we gotta change this mass media term to something else.
[03:47:02.820 --> 03:47:10.044]  Well, I decided to rename it the Magic News Media, because all they really are is a bunch of illusionists.
[03:47:10.384 --> 03:47:23.050]  The question for Bob I have is, because somebody did bring up what I call the Bin Laden Show, and the second part of that question involves the birth certificate.
[03:47:23.050 --> 03:47:32.014]  My question is, do you think that these two situations were simply a way to revitalize Obama's popularity rating?
[03:47:32.014 --> 03:47:32.754]  Yes!
[03:47:32.754 --> 03:47:33.395]  Go ahead, Bob.
[03:47:33.395 --> 03:47:33.835]  Thank you, Tim.
[03:47:35.610 --> 03:47:36.190]  Yes, they were.
[03:47:36.190 --> 03:47:39.752]  There's nothing that they do that's by chance.
[03:47:39.752 --> 03:47:41.393]  There's no coincidence.
[03:47:41.393 --> 03:47:42.733]  Everything is well planned out.
[03:47:42.733 --> 03:47:44.354]  They have people doing that.
[03:47:44.354 --> 03:47:46.515]  And yes, you're correct.
[03:47:46.515 --> 03:47:49.576]  Jeremy in Indiana, you're on the air with Bob and Ted.
[03:47:49.576 --> 03:47:51.037]  Go ahead.
[03:47:51.037 --> 03:47:54.138]  Alex, Bob, hey, I just want to let you know I'm here in Newton County, Indiana.
[03:47:54.138 --> 03:47:57.740]  I was a champion of the Constitution that ran against Sheriff Hitler Hartman here.
[03:47:58.630 --> 03:48:03.395]  And, uh, I just wanted, you know, we've heard yours, Alex, but I'd like to hear Bob Chapman's work, right?
[03:48:03.395 --> 03:48:04.617]  Knowing his background.
[03:48:04.617 --> 03:48:06.018]  How's that?
[03:48:06.018 --> 03:48:07.840]  Bob, he wants you to- AHH!
[03:48:07.840 --> 03:48:08.221]  The enemy.
[03:48:09.830 --> 03:48:22.463]  Well, I think I'm a little old for that, but when I was coaching kids in soccer, they always wanted a war cry, so I made one up for them, and it's called Cack-a-lack-a.
[03:48:22.463 --> 03:48:27.408]  If you can remember that, that's the war cry of the little kids in soccer.
[03:48:27.408 --> 03:48:27.929]  Cack-a-lack-a!
[03:48:34.972 --> 03:48:43.160]  I just wanted to run down the last year, a couple headlines here in Newton County.
[03:48:43.160 --> 03:48:46.843]  We just tipped the iceberg there.
[03:48:46.843 --> 03:48:50.767]  Roxanne Hannaford, Commissioner, charged with profiting from the sale of a child.
[03:48:51.366 --> 03:49:06.033]  Look, I gotta stop you right there, yes.
[03:49:06.033 --> 03:49:10.875]  More and more, criminals have taken over every local government position and we're in deep trouble.
[03:49:10.875 --> 03:49:18.639]  The police openly, in Texas and many towns, pull over old women and rob their purse and say, you don't have proof of this cash, even if you have the printout receipt.
[03:49:19.299 --> 03:49:22.582]  Bob, I mean, it just gets crazier and crazier, doesn't it?
[03:49:22.582 --> 03:49:24.564]  It is awful.
[03:49:24.564 --> 03:49:25.685]  It is awful.
[03:49:25.685 --> 03:49:32.612]  And I've seen some videos of cops saying terrible things to people and that they're going to kill them too.
[03:49:32.612 --> 03:49:39.058]  Oh, that one in Ohio where the guy has a concealed carry so the cop tells him, I ought to kill you for like 10 minutes?
[03:49:40.365 --> 03:49:42.427]  Unbelievable.
[03:49:42.427 --> 03:49:44.368]  I don't know where they're finding them.
[03:49:44.368 --> 03:49:45.449]  I'll be honest with you.
[03:49:45.449 --> 03:49:50.773]  I mean, that guy, I'm surprised that while that cop's saying, I'm going to kill you, I'm going to murder you, the guy didn't defend himself.
[03:49:50.773 --> 03:49:52.514]  I mean, you've got a deranged lunatic.
[03:49:52.514 --> 03:49:53.455]  They pull you over.
[03:49:53.455 --> 03:49:54.476]  I got a concealed carry.
[03:49:54.476 --> 03:49:55.016]  Get out of there.
[03:49:55.016 --> 03:49:56.538]  I'm going to blow your head off.
[03:49:56.538 --> 03:50:00.400]  I mean, it's like they think they're God or something.
[03:50:00.400 --> 03:50:00.841]  That's right.
[03:50:02.088 --> 03:50:07.959]  And it's not all of them, there's just a small percentage, but it makes it bad for all of the law enforcement.
[03:50:07.959 --> 03:50:10.303]  And they're there to help us, and some of them aren't.
[03:50:10.303 --> 03:50:13.289]  They're... mentally deranged.
[03:50:15.111 --> 03:50:17.232]  I tell you, it is.
[03:50:17.232 --> 03:50:20.293]  Or they're like kids that grew up watching wrestling and think it's real.
[03:50:20.293 --> 03:50:27.156]  Like the cops for five minutes did drop, drop knees into this guy's head for no reason while he was unconscious.
[03:50:27.156 --> 03:50:29.137]  I mean, and then killed him.
[03:50:29.137 --> 03:50:31.438]  I mean, of course you killed him, you morons.
[03:50:31.438 --> 03:50:33.539]  I mean, you can kill somebody with one punch, you hit him right.
[03:50:34.199 --> 03:50:36.681]  And it's just incredible.
[03:50:36.681 --> 03:50:41.724]  It's like them trying to show off that they bagged a turkey or something.
[03:50:41.724 --> 03:50:43.545]  It's like they're hunting us.
[03:50:43.545 --> 03:50:47.068]  Bob, I look forward to seeing you for an hour next Friday, Lord willing.
[03:50:47.068 --> 03:50:48.849]  And we'll talk to you soon, my friend.
[03:50:48.849 --> 03:50:49.949]  Sorry to the other callers.
[03:50:49.949 --> 03:50:51.350]  Ted Anderson, thank you for joining us.
[03:50:51.350 --> 03:50:53.332]  I hope folks will call over the weekend.
[03:50:53.332 --> 03:50:55.133]  You will have brokers there, Ted?
[03:50:55.133 --> 03:50:57.054]  We'll have them here right through Sunday.
[03:50:57.054 --> 03:51:01.497]  Colin, and the neat part about it, Alex, the good news, the books are selling and so are the videos.
[03:51:01.497 --> 03:51:02.077]  We're out of time.
[03:51:02.077 --> 03:51:02.658]  Thank you, Ted.
