[00:00.000 --> 00:11.760]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-offs you want answers well
[00:11.760 --> 00:19.320]  so does he he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin
[00:19.320 --> 00:41.280]  Texas Alex Jones
[00:41.280 --> 00:47.640]  all right my friends thank you so much for joining us it is Friday the fifth
[00:47.640 --> 00:54.080]  day of August 2011 and we're going to be live here for the next three hours and
[00:54.080 --> 00:58.400]  we're going to have absolutely open phones to respond to the Super
[00:58.400 --> 01:04.160]  Congress the debt ceiling increase the plunging stock market yesterday losing
[01:04.160 --> 01:10.440]  512 points I had rebounded a little bit this morning but is now set back in to
[01:10.440 --> 01:18.000]  its fall stock slump amid global jitters and we have those reports here that
[01:18.000 --> 01:24.480]  we're going to be going over it's down well over 100 points on the Dow Jones
[01:24.480 --> 01:29.920]  industrial average right now in fact I'll give you those exact numbers here in a
[01:29.920 --> 01:39.600]  moment it's now down the plunges happening even faster 208 points so
[01:39.600 --> 01:49.840]  not not not not good news here ladies and gentlemen and there's also a report
[01:49.840 --> 01:56.800]  here Dow likely to drop to 10,600 the charts are showing the rough ride for
[01:56.800 --> 02:00.400]  equities may not be over according to the charts after losing 500 points
[02:00.400 --> 02:04.840]  Thursday the Dow could drop another 700 points before finding some support
[02:04.840 --> 02:12.720]  Darryl the Gumby CEO of Gumby traders told CNBC this morning Mark Fomber who's
[02:12.720 --> 02:17.920]  been very accurate in his predictions is predicting that this basically will go
[02:17.920 --> 02:26.840]  into a collapse at least in Europe and he is also predicting in fact I believe
[02:26.840 --> 02:32.440]  I printed that article but I don't I don't see it here he is also predicting
[02:32.440 --> 02:38.600]  that they will start a war as a smoke screen for this that is the that is the
[02:38.600 --> 02:45.960]  standard action that is taken by the establishment when things like this
[02:45.960 --> 02:49.400]  begin to happen generally because they're engineering the collapse but need
[02:49.400 --> 02:52.880]  the political cover because if there's a war going on it's okay of the
[02:52.880 --> 02:56.560]  government basically absolutely rapes and robsons in some people's minds
[02:56.560 --> 03:01.640]  Russian on voice as NATO is planning attacks on Syria and Iran we told you
[03:01.640 --> 03:06.720]  this I don't know over a month and a half ago from our for hood sources and
[03:06.720 --> 03:11.120]  others and we have countless callers here to the show or current military
[03:11.120 --> 03:16.280]  confirming also contractors confirming that that is the case that either
[03:16.280 --> 03:20.960]  Gaddafi leaves or that a late September early October the full ground
[03:20.960 --> 03:28.080]  invasion with regular army made up of the first cab and others will begin
[03:28.080 --> 03:32.520]  and obviously that is a big big deal upwards of 200 million firearms and
[03:32.520 --> 03:37.560]  RPGs have been handed out in the last four or five months by Gaddafi to the
[03:37.560 --> 03:44.280]  population of Western Libya and large portions of them are intending to fight
[03:44.280 --> 03:49.040]  and that will be particularly nasty and will kill a lot of civilians and also
[03:49.040 --> 03:58.040]  NATO troops which you know will be predominantly predominantly US forces
[03:58.040 --> 04:03.440]  show very serious times here in every case when there's big global meltdowns
[04:03.440 --> 04:08.000]  governments will launch new wars or stage terror attacks or both and we've
[04:08.000 --> 04:13.400]  been seeing a rebranding now that the Tea Party are the terrorist and work with
[04:13.400 --> 04:17.560]  Al Qaeda and are going to be attacking and people that are for pro-second
[04:17.560 --> 04:21.080]  amendment or property rights or don't want the Federal Reserve to completely
[04:21.080 --> 04:26.120]  bankrupt the nation you are terrorist and you are violent and you are evil we
[04:26.120 --> 04:30.560]  saw media matters come out and take out of context things I've said yesterday
[04:30.560 --> 04:35.440]  in implying that I'm pushing for violence which everybody knows is the
[04:35.440 --> 04:41.280]  complete opposite but what do you expect from George Soros so that is coming up
[04:41.280 --> 04:47.120]  as well two-year Treasury yields drop record lobe race to cash banks impose
[04:47.120 --> 04:52.680]  fee on rapidly growing deposits we've also got all sorts of racial tension or

[08:04.440 --> 08:19.680]  on the GCN radio network it is Friday the fifth day of August 2011 thank you
[08:19.680 --> 08:23.680]  for joining us here today we're live Monday through Friday 11 a.m. to 2 p.m.
[08:23.680 --> 08:28.440]  central that's 12 noon to 3 p.m. Eastern and of course I come back live
[08:28.440 --> 08:36.520]  Sundays 4 to 6 p.m. Central as well with the abbreviated Sunday transmission now
[08:36.520 --> 08:42.840]  for our listeners what's happening right now is no surprise and we have
[08:42.840 --> 08:48.440]  uncannily in the last five years laid out exactly what was going to happen with
[08:48.440 --> 08:54.600]  the economy with a wide index and spectrum of financial historians
[08:54.600 --> 09:01.240]  economists and others who study the globalist economic program it is a
[09:01.240 --> 09:06.680]  program of destroying economies at first they create a lot of free money made
[09:06.680 --> 09:12.200]  about of nothing like Clinton did getting rid of Glass-Steagall people think
[09:12.200 --> 09:16.760]  the economy's doing well but basically you're like someone using heroin for
[09:16.760 --> 09:21.040]  the first time it feels great but six months down the road you've got to have
[09:21.040 --> 09:25.600]  it or you'll basically go into convulsions and that's the point that
[09:25.600 --> 09:31.040]  they've gotten us to we're being positioned into total bankruptcy the Tea
[09:31.040 --> 09:38.280]  Party was wrong saying we've got to not raise the debt ceiling because that will
[09:38.280 --> 09:43.360]  lead to total default and collapse and the the Democrats saying do raise the
[09:43.360 --> 09:47.440]  debt ceiling they were wrong as well because that will lead to an even
[09:47.440 --> 09:53.320]  greater collapse down the road because it's a mathematical certainty that when
[09:53.320 --> 09:58.600]  you create over 1,500 trillion in derivatives and allow the banks to
[09:58.600 --> 10:02.600]  sell that and gain the profit from it and then have the public signed on to
[10:02.600 --> 10:07.600]  the losses from the fraud that it's impossible to pay and it will destroy
[10:07.600 --> 10:12.480]  the economy you must triage it you must declare it the fraud counterfeit
[10:12.480 --> 10:18.840]  instruments it is as we warned you in 2007 2008 I mean I've been covering
[10:18.840 --> 10:23.560]  derivatives since the late 1990s with economists but we've been sound in the
[10:23.560 --> 10:29.600]  alarm really hard since 2002 we got IMF World Bank documents that were leaked
[10:29.600 --> 10:37.560]  detailing how the big central banks were planning to carry this out then in 2008
[10:37.560 --> 10:40.880]  we pointed out the tens of trillions being stolen by the banks too big to
[10:40.880 --> 10:45.240]  fail is being kept by them it's being reinvested into more derivatives to
[10:45.240 --> 10:50.440]  leverage this will only make the depression worse and the collapse worse
[10:50.440 --> 10:55.840]  coming up in the next few years the technical depression would become a
[10:55.840 --> 11:01.200]  freefall depression and now here we are three plus years later and it's happening
[11:01.200 --> 11:07.800]  now the Tea Party the mainline Tea Party was better than the Obama camp of the
[11:07.800 --> 11:11.480]  globalist control paradigm because they were at least saying hey don't raise
[11:11.480 --> 11:16.880]  taxes that will stall the economy even more and the and the mainstream so-called
[11:16.880 --> 11:21.360]  dominant media less and less dominant ran the hoax that they just want to hold
[11:21.360 --> 11:26.720]  up raising the debt ceiling they're just sabotaging the economy why they're just
[11:26.720 --> 11:31.920]  being obstructionist why we know as part of that package the White House was
[11:31.920 --> 11:39.040]  demanding huge tax increases and so I'm not saying the Tea Party is bad it's
[11:39.040 --> 11:43.800]  just that the debate about whether to raise it or not as Dr. Paul Craig
[11:43.800 --> 11:48.600]  Roberts and Webster Tarpley and Ron Paul and the Chinese government who's
[11:48.600 --> 11:51.480]  heavily invested in Treasury bills have said there's already technically a
[11:51.480 --> 11:56.720]  default you're already monetizing over 75% now of the new Treasury bills people
[11:56.720 --> 12:02.640]  aren't buying them the country is going into cardiac arrest we've got to get
[12:02.640 --> 12:07.480]  rid of the Federal Reserve we've got to say no to these derivatives and yes it's
[12:07.480 --> 12:11.680]  going to cause a depression but one will get out of much quicker we're never
[12:11.680 --> 12:17.800]  getting out of this we are going to become debt slaves I was seeing numbers
[12:17.800 --> 12:22.160]  of it's over a half a million dollars per person if we supposedly sign
[12:22.160 --> 12:26.960]  ourselves on which the politicians have done and some estimates even higher
[12:26.960 --> 12:30.760]  individually half a million bucks and then it continues to grow exponentially
[12:30.760 --> 12:35.880]  that's only paying off the interest and and and and keeping these derivatives
[12:35.880 --> 12:40.160]  from totally melting down they've mixed them in and tied them in and
[12:40.160 --> 12:44.800]  contaminated all the major financial systems all the major stocks and bonds
[12:44.800 --> 12:51.600]  are invested in them everything is is is contaminated by this pathogen by this
[12:51.600 --> 12:59.000]  metastasization of this derivatives fractional reserve banking scam they're
[12:59.000 --> 13:03.920]  devaluing global currencies so fast right now that banks are announcing
[13:03.920 --> 13:08.640]  they're going to make you pay to keep cash in the bank now that's an attempt
[13:08.640 --> 13:12.120]  of course they could loan those out for every dollar you deposit they can
[13:12.120 --> 13:15.600]  leverage out $10 under the old fractional reserve banking rule but see they
[13:15.600 --> 13:20.360]  don't even need your money anymore because under the derivatives rules which
[13:20.360 --> 13:24.200]  they haven't stopped they didn't bring back last eagle three years ago in 2008
[13:24.200 --> 13:29.600]  during the controlled implosion no no they have taken the bailout money and
[13:29.600 --> 13:35.280]  accelerated the leveraging of the derivatives so I want to take your
[13:35.280 --> 13:41.520]  calls on this subjects on the Supreme Council of 13 the Super Congress with
[13:41.520 --> 13:45.640]  the president its head Ron Paul Larry Pratt others have said yes this is
[13:45.640 --> 13:49.840]  unconstitutional a lot of newspapers are now looking at it saying this isn't
[13:49.840 --> 13:55.720]  really just a committee because it decides on taxes on well Harry Reid says
[13:55.720 --> 13:58.560]  the way he interprets it the leader of the Senate it's on everything and I've
[13:58.560 --> 14:03.720]  read you those quotes and I've played you the C-span clip and we'll see if
[14:03.720 --> 14:06.880]  that power grab works I mean you're like well they'll specifically say they can
[14:06.880 --> 14:10.880]  go after guns well Obama specifically can't launch wars the congressional
[14:10.880 --> 14:14.800]  approval he's doing it the ATF can't go put new gun laws in place without law
[14:14.800 --> 14:18.680]  but they're doing it even though the NRA is now doing something right for once
[14:18.680 --> 14:24.600]  and actually suing them over this we've got to grow up and stop denying this is
[14:24.600 --> 14:28.640]  happening we've we've got to admit what's happened we've got to admit they've
[14:28.640 --> 14:32.200]  gotten rid of the filibuster on these key spending and cutting bills which are
[14:32.200 --> 14:37.080]  everything everything connected to spending and cuts that you can't add
[14:37.080 --> 14:41.280]  an amendment that the bills in these areas originate now from six House and
[14:41.280 --> 14:46.160]  six Senate members and it's going to take as Judge Andrew Napolitano has said
[14:46.160 --> 14:49.640]  members of the House and Senate standing up and saying you don't take my
[14:49.640 --> 14:53.520]  right to bring bills in on these issues and to add amendments and to filibuster
[14:53.520 --> 14:57.960]  in the Senate and people are just a lot of people are just taking this like it's
[14:57.960 --> 15:02.480]  no big deal big and they say well this is just fast track kind of like what was
[15:02.480 --> 15:06.000]  done starting with the World Trade Organization the mid 90s where Congress
[15:06.000 --> 15:10.440]  gives up a lot of its authority to this foreign group but just because they've
[15:10.440 --> 15:14.320]  been engaged in treason for a long time just because the Federal Reserve
[15:14.320 --> 15:21.760]  hijacked this country 97 years ago or almost 98 years ago 1913 does it mean
[15:21.760 --> 15:28.160]  it's okay just because they've had unconstitutional gun control laws in
[15:28.160 --> 15:31.880]  place for decades doesn't mean they shouldn't be repealed you know just
[15:31.880 --> 15:36.960]  because they had laws saying women couldn't vote it doesn't mean they
[15:36.960 --> 15:43.840]  shouldn't be repealed government is power grabbing right now because the
[15:43.840 --> 15:48.240]  special interests that run it are going for broke they've committed so many
[15:48.240 --> 15:52.160]  crimes they've got to bring in a total police state and sew this thing up or
[15:52.160 --> 15:56.120]  they're going to lose it all it is a gamble it is a bold stroke they're
[15:56.120 --> 16:00.760]  attempting here and if we are aware of their financial attack and if we speak
[16:00.760 --> 16:04.960]  out and step up and point them out that they're the criminals they will not have
[16:04.960 --> 16:09.760]  the moral authority and it will give good attorney generals and good grand
[16:09.760 --> 16:14.600]  juries and good members of the House and Senate and others and media people
[16:14.600 --> 16:21.400]  the moral courage and the solidarity to stand up together now I want to hit a
[16:21.400 --> 16:24.160]  few other news items we'll get into more detail on later in the broadcast today
[16:24.160 --> 16:26.720]  but I want to just give you the number I want to take a lot of calls today but
[16:26.720 --> 16:29.000]  please have your question and comment ready because I want to get to the next
[16:29.000 --> 16:36.640]  person 1-800-259-9231 also if your military can get in we told you I
[16:36.640 --> 16:39.840]  wasn't a month and a half ago we wrote the articles from our Fort Hood sources
[16:39.840 --> 16:46.200]  and then we opened the phones up and had other military contractors others
[16:46.200 --> 16:49.880]  call and say yes the word is special forces are going to be increased in
[16:49.880 --> 16:54.360]  July and August on the ground that's now confirmed and did happen and in
[16:54.360 --> 16:59.680]  September early October a major ground invasion under three core and then under
[16:59.680 --> 17:05.200]  that first cab and others that's just the ground force and Libby is serving out
[17:05.200 --> 17:09.920]  upwards of 2 million fully automatic Kalashnikovs and other rifles handguns
[17:09.920 --> 17:14.680]  RPGs and then the regular army with a lot of high-tech goodies they bought from
[17:14.680 --> 17:19.800]  the British the French and others so as one military man said on this show
[17:19.800 --> 17:26.560]  Colonel Gaddafi's got a lot of nasty stuff under his hat and well here is the
[17:26.560 --> 17:31.120]  Russian envoy today Paul Joseph Watson has an article on it it's also being
[17:31.120 --> 17:35.080]  reported by debka file which is proven to be very accurate in the past with a
[17:35.080 --> 17:41.080]  direct line right into Israeli Shin Beton Assad Russian envoy NATO is
[17:41.080 --> 17:46.760]  planning attacks on Syria and Iran prisonplanet.com please get this out
[17:46.760 --> 17:51.040]  to everybody even as it finds itself embroiled in Libya NATO is preparing a
[17:51.040 --> 17:57.520]  launch of military assault on Syria so again we already got the words they're
[17:57.520 --> 18:00.320]  planning and they've told the troops doesn't mean it's necessarily going to
[18:00.320 --> 18:05.600]  happen but that they're going to attempt to launch a ground war and whether
[18:05.600 --> 18:08.560]  that's a bluff or not we don't know to make Gaddafi stand down they said they
[18:08.560 --> 18:11.600]  killed his son again I don't know how many sons he's got but they've been
[18:11.600 --> 18:14.200]  proven to have lied about that a couple times in the past whether they ran a
[18:14.200 --> 18:18.440]  Venezuela so I don't know the truth but but yes you've seen Obama this week
[18:18.440 --> 18:25.440]  coming out and saying that hey Syria we meant to do something here if the forces
[18:25.440 --> 18:29.320]  we're backing to attack you if you continue to mow them down but it's very
[18:29.320 --> 18:33.000]  hypocritical I'm not defending Syria I mean it is a dictatorship I don't like
[18:33.000 --> 18:37.640]  it but Israel just a month or so ago and the Golan Heights mowed down all those
[18:37.640 --> 18:43.720]  people peacefully trying to walk into area that was their land before so this
[18:43.720 --> 18:48.440]  would be like if Mexico took part of Texas back and then a decade later so
[18:48.440 --> 18:52.200]  Texans walked across you and trying to go back to their farms and were shot and
[18:52.200 --> 18:57.320]  then the media praised it as a great move my issue here is regardless of which
[18:57.320 --> 19:00.920]  side of this issue are of your neutral or if you realize it's all divide and
[19:00.920 --> 19:06.280]  conquer manipulation still there's a lot of hypocrisy here Russian envoy NATO is
[19:06.280 --> 19:11.120]  planning attacks on Syria and Iran even as it finds itself still enrolled in
[19:11.120 --> 19:14.880]  Libya NATO is preparing a launch a military assault on Syria in order to
[19:14.880 --> 19:20.840]  create a beachhead for a future attack on Iran claims Russian envoy to NATO
[19:20.840 --> 19:26.320]  Dmitry Rogazin and he's the highest level as it gets the planning the military
[19:26.320 --> 19:29.800]  campaign is well underway what does Mark Fawber say today he says they're
[19:29.800 --> 19:32.880]  getting ready to launch a war because of the financial collapse again they bring
[19:32.880 --> 19:35.920]  the collapse and it could solidate but give you a war so you'll do what you're
[19:35.920 --> 19:39.000]  told then they could stage terror attacks they could doffees doing it
[19:39.000 --> 19:42.640]  Assad's doing it with the tea party because now they say the tea party works
[19:42.640 --> 19:46.360]  with the Muslims now anybody that believes that on average a lot of tea party
[19:46.360 --> 19:50.440]  people are absolute Islamophobes actually have you know some have been
[19:50.440 --> 19:53.440]  locked in dartboards at home but they nevertheless they're saying it they

[24:14.080 --> 24:19.720]  protection team that whenever the establishment wants to boost the stock
[24:19.720 --> 24:24.320]  market back up the government goes in with your tax money and buy stocks now
[24:24.320 --> 24:32.360]  the insiders are always aware of that and they're given the knowledge beforehand
[24:32.360 --> 24:36.080]  that's another way that the big boys are allowed to engage in insider trading but
[24:36.080 --> 24:41.720]  then if Martha Stewart gets caught not even insider trading but quote lying to
[24:41.720 --> 24:46.440]  the FBI she goes to jail people think of Martha Stewart as the elite no folks
[24:46.440 --> 24:50.520]  Martha Stewart isn't the elite she's a media person by the way if you go to
[24:50.520 --> 24:55.080]  CNBC.com you can see the latest graph and we'll put that up on screen for
[24:55.080 --> 25:00.120]  Prison Planet dot TV viewers here in a moment but it lost over 200 points first
[25:00.120 --> 25:04.000]  it went up about a hundred points this morning then it dropped over 200 then it
[25:04.000 --> 25:11.040]  gained back more than 200 and it started dropping again it's now 64 points point
[25:11.040 --> 25:20.600]  59 down NASDAQ's down 45.83 that's 1.79 percent or more than triple but the
[25:20.600 --> 25:27.440]  Dow's down the NASDAQ's really getting stomped S&P is down 1.22 percent
[25:28.800 --> 25:35.040]  hit refresh on that guys because that's weird I'm getting so it's gyrating all
[25:35.040 --> 25:38.280]  over the place I guess it was going down and then it just peaked back up so now
[25:38.280 --> 25:43.080]  it's only down 49.42 points boy it's really volatile okay let's go to your
[25:43.080 --> 25:48.440]  phone calls as we continue to watch all of this today George and then Jack Dave
[25:48.440 --> 25:52.240]  Ken Malcolm and others when you hear a call hang up you can get in we love to
[25:52.240 --> 25:58.120]  hear from you 800-259-9231 on this live Friday edition Bob Chapman is joining us
[25:58.120 --> 26:01.760]  coming up the third hour of open phones then and I've got a bunch of news I
[26:01.760 --> 26:05.720]  haven't even gotten to yet but first your calls George in Pennsylvania you're on
[26:05.720 --> 26:11.640]  the air thank you for all you do I try to help spread your information by making
[26:11.640 --> 26:15.640]  a stamp putting an all on all dollar bills to find out more information at
[26:15.640 --> 26:19.400]  the end for wars I'm going to be going to 9-11 our slave leader is going to be
[26:19.400 --> 26:24.360]  there I'm going to be protesting the Fed and I think anybody that can be in the
[26:24.360 --> 26:29.920]  area probably should make their concerns on the local things of pertinent
[26:29.920 --> 26:34.040]  interest known to our leaders one of the thing is that the other day you said
[26:34.040 --> 26:39.040]  something about how much debt per person the government's running up
[26:39.040 --> 26:42.680]  probably should be debt per taxpayer there's only a hundred thousand people
[26:42.680 --> 26:47.800]  to actually file IRS forms of that there's only about 54,000 to pay that so
[26:47.800 --> 26:52.080]  hold on you're saying there's only a hundred thousand people filing tax forms
[26:52.080 --> 26:56.960]  I think I think you're mistaken I think you're talking about I mean I know
[26:56.960 --> 27:00.840]  roughly half the population doesn't doesn't pay quote income taxes that pay
[27:00.840 --> 27:04.880]  the Social Security and other taxes but I and it depends on how you look at the
[27:04.880 --> 27:09.440]  debt but they talk about you know the average household 80,000 in our 400,000
[27:09.440 --> 27:13.480]  or 500,000 I see a lot of different numbers the point is most the debt they
[27:13.480 --> 27:19.040]  admit is derivative so we don't really owe it it's not ours but that in working
[27:19.040 --> 27:23.360]  out the debt per taxpayer there's a hundred million people at file there's
[27:23.360 --> 27:26.560]  only 50 million that actually pay taxes on that according to the government
[27:26.560 --> 27:30.800]  figures and so that'll work about oh no you're right I misheard you I thought you
[27:30.800 --> 27:35.760]  said a hundred thousand please continue I did I misquoted and the other thing is
[27:35.760 --> 27:40.040]  that he said that the rush is trying to increase population I see a lot of
[27:40.040 --> 27:44.960]  people around where I live that a lot of these girls get out of high school and
[27:44.960 --> 27:48.040]  they get pregnant and they've turned that into a career they get big screen
[27:48.040 --> 27:53.200]  TVs they get cars they get food they get things that I feel like I can't afford
[27:53.200 --> 27:58.720]  and so yeah the government's supporting a lot of people population increase on
[27:58.720 --> 28:01.720]  the lower end I hear you and I appreciate your call I'll go to another
[28:01.720 --> 28:06.320]  caller in a moment but this is some food for thought we put out a document that
[28:06.320 --> 28:10.160]  was internal it said not for distribution that was sent to us by
[28:10.160 --> 28:13.840]  somebody inside the state police there in Texas and it said we are mainly
[28:13.840 --> 28:19.120]  trying to hire only military veterans and that sounds reasonable on the
[28:19.120 --> 28:24.720]  surface but government is already gobbling up a large portion of the GDP
[28:24.720 --> 28:28.760]  one way or another more than half the population survives off a government
[28:28.760 --> 28:34.960]  paycheck whether it's corporate welfare or social security or food stamps I mean
[28:34.960 --> 28:38.120]  at a certain point what about people that didn't work for the government I
[28:38.120 --> 28:41.560]  mean that's discrimination you can't say well we're only gonna hire black people
[28:41.560 --> 28:44.920]  really gonna hire white people are Hispanics we're only gonna hire Mormons
[28:44.920 --> 28:49.600]  or Catholics or Muslims well then how do you say and Obama says it we need to
[28:49.600 --> 28:55.840]  have tax breaks to hire military or military how about we hire how about we
[28:55.840 --> 29:00.480]  have tax breaks for anybody that hires that would get jobs going but the
[29:00.480 --> 29:04.480]  government knows when you cut taxes it gets the economy going they know that
[29:04.480 --> 29:10.400]  again Kennedy cut the highest tax bracket by 50% the next tax bracket by 35
[29:10.400 --> 29:16.200]  tax receipts doubled one year later that numbers public and pull it up why
[29:16.200 --> 29:20.560]  don't they do that because they want to control the economy and so that's
[29:20.560 --> 29:28.360]  discrimination I'm I'm I'm all for see see you they sell it well get a tax
[29:28.360 --> 29:34.160]  incentive for a wounded vet I agree with that but that's how the road to hell is
[29:34.160 --> 29:39.320]  paved next it's all the troops then it's oh government workers who are being laid
[29:39.320 --> 29:43.360]  off companies you get an incentive to hire them what about everybody else it's
[29:43.360 --> 29:47.840]  discrimination it's discrimination we'll be right back when more your phone
[29:47.840 --> 29:55.960]  calls stay with us we're on the March the Empire's on the run Alex Jones and

[30:23.880 --> 30:27.920]  dangerously overloaded and now new socialist legislation is only
[30:27.920 --> 30:31.720]  compounding the problem number four dangerous weather is always a threat to

[35:20.720 --> 35:24.240]  to go up to ourselves huh so that's the problem with corruption it doesn't just
[35:24.240 --> 35:30.600]  stay in one spot doesn't just sit in one spot you either fight it and you push
[35:30.600 --> 35:36.200]  it back or it gets worse it doesn't sit in one spot and so see the corrupt all
[35:36.200 --> 35:39.440]  across this country or people in a lot of cases that aren't even mentally
[35:39.440 --> 35:44.400]  corrupt they believe that might is right and that's their power to do this the
[35:44.400 --> 35:47.440]  road to hell is paved with good intentions as they say and the social
[35:47.440 --> 35:51.760]  engineers know that so they they give people false mental roadmaps of why
[35:51.760 --> 35:54.920]  they're doing what they're doing and then pretty soon nobody can report on
[35:54.920 --> 35:58.800]  each other's corruption because you are corrupt you've done something corrupt
[35:58.800 --> 36:02.960]  and so now the other people around you get more and more corrupt and then the
[36:02.960 --> 36:09.480]  very wicked you know most corrupt people it's like a brace or something they
[36:09.480 --> 36:13.760]  get in bigger and bigger positions of power and then everything goes to you
[36:13.760 --> 36:20.160]  know what in a handbasket that's how it works that's why we know it's gonna get
[36:20.160 --> 36:22.480]  more and more insane just like we've been telling you the last few years and
[36:22.480 --> 36:28.400]  it has gotten that way this is the way almost all countries go this is normal
[36:28.400 --> 36:35.300]  this is the vast majority of cases and at the minute that Americans can hear
[36:35.300 --> 36:40.160]  this show and don't think this guy is radical the minute you study history and
[36:40.160 --> 36:44.000]  really look at what we're saying and go wow this guy actually isn't even saying
[36:44.000 --> 36:49.840]  how bad it is the minute we stop being naive that's when the tide turns the
[36:49.840 --> 36:55.080]  minute you realize it's illegitimate not a famous rapper on yesterday
[36:55.080 --> 37:00.600]  50 you mean 50 cent I mean he came up with those guys just as big over the
[37:00.600 --> 37:08.400]  last you know decade or so prodigy and great informed guy awake since the late
[37:08.400 --> 37:16.160]  80s and he has a gun can't have a gun in New York they arrest him he serves a
[37:16.160 --> 37:19.720]  couple years in jail for it and I said you know that was wrong and he said no I
[37:19.720 --> 37:23.240]  did something wrong I did my time and I said well I didn't want to say cuz he's
[37:23.240 --> 37:27.440]  black but almost said because it's the example I usually use really was it was
[37:27.440 --> 37:31.000]  the law that black people were slaves and weren't human it's gonna follow that
[37:31.000 --> 37:35.280]  law it was the law women couldn't vote you're gonna follow that it was the law
[37:35.280 --> 37:38.480]  you couldn't go buy a beer you go to jail for it prohibition you're gonna
[37:38.480 --> 37:44.320]  follow that I mean look freedom isn't something you compromise on and the
[37:44.320 --> 37:48.440]  minute you get it through your head America and the rest of the world that
[37:48.440 --> 37:51.720]  a bunch of crooks are running things we could turn this around and I'm gonna go
[37:51.720 --> 37:54.720]  to your calls but I want to add this final caveat I'm gonna get into it more
[37:54.720 --> 38:01.800]  later because it's in my stack here got a couple articles the BBC of all groups
[38:01.800 --> 38:07.680]  has had to come out admit 5,000 years ago there was half the ice in the arctic
[38:07.680 --> 38:14.720]  there is today now for years they will show you a satellite above the North
[38:14.720 --> 38:20.680]  Pole showing you in the winter months the ice shrinking by about half and say
[38:20.680 --> 38:24.880]  when they show people that to say look it's shrinking my gosh it'll be gone in
[38:24.880 --> 38:31.000]  one year as Al Gore says every year now that's why there's the North passages for
[38:31.000 --> 38:35.520]  thousands of years written about for Northern Europeans and others and the
[38:35.520 --> 38:40.560]  Japanese as well that you could go through there in the summer and if you
[38:40.560 --> 38:43.960]  go early in the spring you need an icebreaker it's gotten thin but you can
[38:43.960 --> 38:49.000]  get through it everybody knows that half of that ice shelf in the North melts
[38:49.000 --> 38:53.760]  every year the smaller percentage of the Antarctic and pull the numbers up it's
[38:53.760 --> 38:56.760]  like when the news says the polar bear can't swim and shows one swimming and
[38:56.760 --> 38:59.360]  says they're grounding it turned out course that's a total lie that the
[38:59.360 --> 39:03.400]  greatest swimming land animal there is recorded swimming upwards of 300 miles
[39:03.400 --> 39:07.720]  they hunt in the water killing seals and beluga whale they can haul a beluga
[39:07.720 --> 39:13.920]  whale up with one arm okay I mean a polar bear will eat a grizzly bears
[39:13.920 --> 39:19.320]  lunch ladies and gentlemen they're completely powerful okay the in fact
[39:19.320 --> 39:22.920]  there's nothing walking around more vicious on the planet but they tell you
[39:22.920 --> 39:26.840]  oh they're dying oh it's melting look at them out of that iceberg yeah they're
[39:26.840 --> 39:33.120]  hunting and the people telling you that are congenital conscious liars to make
[39:33.120 --> 39:36.720]  you feel guilty so they can put a carbon tax on you to pay it to Al Gore and
[39:36.720 --> 39:40.480]  Lord Rothschild and David Rockefeller on record who openly run the carbon
[39:40.480 --> 39:48.720]  trading facilities now that came out the BBC had to admit okay five thousand
[39:48.720 --> 39:55.360]  years ago the the the ice sheet was half of what it is now and it looks like it's
[39:55.360 --> 40:01.680]  natural the Hadron collider info came out they mimic the ions coming out of
[40:01.680 --> 40:05.680]  space that's what's forming most the clouds that was known 20 years ago we
[40:05.680 --> 40:10.160]  told you that but the UN had a vote two years ago saying no we say it doesn't
[40:10.160 --> 40:17.280]  affect it we say sunlight doesn't make plants grow we say I mean okay you say
[40:17.280 --> 40:22.840]  the earth's flat you know go go lock Copernicus up you know you say Galileo's
[40:22.840 --> 40:27.240]  wrong lock him up the the earth's you know not the center of the universe and
[40:27.240 --> 40:34.320]  the plants the planets move I mean show now another big report came out where
[40:34.320 --> 40:43.200]  they're having to admit that increasing temperature ups co2 not co2 ups the
[40:43.200 --> 40:47.200]  temperature you know Al Gore lied he's been caught in fact in British court they
[40:47.200 --> 40:50.920]  ordered it pulled out of the schools his inconvenient propaganda his
[40:50.920 --> 40:54.160]  inconvenient man bear pig his inconvenient truth excuse me got the name
[40:54.160 --> 40:59.040]  right the third time he took the graph and shows co2 going up and then
[40:59.040 --> 41:03.480]  temperature going up and it turns out it's flipped he actually took public
[41:03.480 --> 41:06.600]  data that was publicly available but he knew you didn't know how to go look that
[41:06.600 --> 41:11.200]  up and flipped it and showed you a graphic of a baby polar bear a cartoon of
[41:11.200 --> 41:20.140]  one dying couldn't swim the minute the minute that guys I forget it was 67 or
[41:20.140 --> 41:23.360]  69 I think it's 67 pull up yesterday's article I never got to it
[41:23.360 --> 41:29.440]  Rasmussen poll 67% believe global warming scientists lying just just put
[41:29.440 --> 41:33.440]  that on screen I want to double check my number but I believe it's 67% now
[41:33.440 --> 41:39.400]  in a Rasmussen poll don't believe it see it went from nine out of ten three
[41:39.400 --> 41:45.160]  years ago believing it because the media wouldn't lie to now six or almost seven
[41:45.160 --> 41:50.200]  out of ten not believing it and it's it's accelerating once you wake up to the
[41:50.200 --> 41:56.360]  fraud it's all over but you've got to do it you've got to stop being naive the
[41:56.360 --> 42:00.560]  day you hear this show and think that it's not radical is the day you've
[42:00.560 --> 42:06.280]  woken up okay it's that simple because even if I'm not right about 100% of
[42:06.280 --> 42:09.720]  things and Lord knows I make mistakes you know about stuff routinely and try to
[42:09.720 --> 42:14.840]  go back and cover it when I do the point is is that in history the things I'm
[42:14.840 --> 42:17.680]  talking about have happened over and over again and we're seeing a lot of it
[42:17.680 --> 42:21.840]  happen now and it's good to be alarmist it's good to be upset it's good to be
[42:21.840 --> 42:25.480]  defending liberty okay I'm gonna shut up now and go to your calls did you find
[42:25.480 --> 42:43.520]  my Rasmussen here I can watch this watch this Rasmussen Rasmussen 67% think
[42:43.520 --> 42:57.840]  scientist lying boom okay I was wrong I'm sorry and I apologize yes put it on
[42:57.840 --> 43:02.080]  screen for folks he found it as well I apologize as I told you I'm now spot
[43:02.080 --> 43:08.440]  checking almost everything I say on here my memory failed 69% say it's likely
[43:08.440 --> 43:11.640]  scientists to falsify global warming data and again we'll put that on screen
[43:11.640 --> 43:15.520]  you can document cams shot it off right here thank you
[43:15.520 --> 43:18.080]  because people are gonna say that's a lot we must show them we're not gonna
[43:18.080 --> 43:20.520]  believe they're not gonna look it up they're gonna say I'm making it up I've
[43:20.520 --> 43:27.760]  got to show them this again you can just type in 69% it says likely scientists
[43:27.760 --> 43:31.720]  at falsify global warming research there it is Rasmussen and they won't
[43:31.720 --> 43:37.160]  believe that either pull back let them see where it says Rasmussen reports in
[43:37.160 --> 43:40.640]  fact they're not gonna believe the you know my BBC about the ice thing so I have
[43:40.640 --> 43:45.760]  to get that show it to them the point is is that we're being lied to I mean I've
[43:45.760 --> 43:50.440]  gotten more articles in the mainstream news today dealing with the federal
[43:50.440 --> 43:54.840]  court documents coming out the top drug cartel leaders do indeed they filed them
[43:54.840 --> 43:59.640]  in evidence work for the US government and we're using them to knock out their
[43:59.640 --> 44:04.360]  competition and that reportedly 3,000 people have died including many police
[44:04.360 --> 44:09.640]  it is estimated approximately 3,000 people were killed in Mexico as a result
[44:09.640 --> 44:14.200]  of operation fast and furious including law enforcement officers in the state of
[44:14.200 --> 44:18.600]  Sinaloa Mexico the headquarters of the Sinaloa cartel the court documents
[44:18.600 --> 44:22.520]  alleged and it goes on the just department okay let's go to your phone
[44:22.520 --> 44:26.680]  calls I've got to have open phones here Jack in Michigan you're on the air
[44:26.680 --> 44:34.520]  thanks for holding hey Alex you're you are a true blue Patriot spirit brother
[44:34.520 --> 44:41.320]  in the in the league of bull brights the last time I was politically active I
[44:41.320 --> 44:46.940]  supported bull brights and in my lifetime since I was too young to know
[44:46.940 --> 44:53.960]  JFK but I did learn that had had bull been elected of course we wouldn't be in
[44:53.960 --> 44:58.480]  the position where and now because he would have terminated the federal
[44:58.480 --> 45:05.880]  reserve and really all we got to do that's it's it's uninformed consent
[45:05.880 --> 45:12.760]  fraud is simply paying back their original 500 mil we'll give him a
[45:12.760 --> 45:18.360]  billion right and they don't leave we'll just you know from a big party over
[45:18.360 --> 45:22.800]  there with the polar bears and see how well they can swim with the polar bears
[45:22.800 --> 45:28.720]  but well another number I said in the last ten years polar bear numbers have
[45:28.720 --> 45:33.760]  doubled and that was true but then I was corrected by Dilling pole since 1950
[45:33.760 --> 45:39.680]  their numbers are up five-fold they're like giant powerful goblin roaches that
[45:39.680 --> 45:43.400]  will break in your house and eat everything actually I like polar bears
[45:43.400 --> 45:46.880]  the point is they're running around everywhere but they lie and say they're
[45:46.880 --> 45:50.600]  all dying give Al Gore money so you know and he showed you a cartoon of one that
[45:50.600 --> 45:58.520]  can't swim so it must be true the Alex the golden rule has got everybody
[45:58.520 --> 46:05.560]  enslaved right who controls the gold the currency rule so I have a report from a
[46:05.560 --> 46:11.880]  fellow that used to be an aide to a federal judge and it describes the
[46:11.880 --> 46:18.920]  intrinsic insidious fraud of all loan agreements whether it's credit cards
[46:18.920 --> 46:24.800]  mortgages whatever the promissory note you can the clue if you haven't already
[46:24.800 --> 46:28.760]  been told this you have a checking account you scope it with a magnifying
[46:28.760 --> 46:34.040]  glass and you see a miniature dot matrix the words authorized signature so it
[46:34.040 --> 46:38.720]  so happens just like on the promissory note everyone signs with the loan
[46:38.720 --> 46:46.960]  agreement which is a contract you know authorized signature is is authorizing
[46:46.960 --> 46:53.200]  the creation of the money or the currency that funds the loan so the the loan
[46:53.200 --> 46:57.520]  company whatever it is is not loaning from their assets nor those of their
[46:57.520 --> 47:03.360]  client depositors it's the contracting borrower that's creating the currency
[47:03.360 --> 47:07.040]  that funds his or yes that's fractional reserve banking good point and I
[47:07.040 --> 47:13.240]  appreciate your call and then they just expand that out into derivatives and
[47:13.240 --> 47:17.760]  that's why banks are now you got to pay us to keep cash here but we're like but
[47:17.760 --> 47:21.120]  you're loaning it out they're like buddy we don't care about fractional reserve
[47:21.120 --> 47:24.800]  banking loaning out 10 to 1 now and making money up out of nothing we can
[47:24.800 --> 47:29.040]  make up whatever we want as long as you're a big mega bank now if your local
[47:29.040 --> 47:32.740]  credit union gets a crooked toenail they're gonna be SWAT team so fast it'll
[47:32.740 --> 47:36.400]  make your head spin and that's also what's happening is the big mega banks
[47:36.400 --> 47:40.240]  are taking over all the real legitimate banks that actually do help fund this
[47:40.240 --> 47:45.800]  country let's go ahead and talk to Dave in Canada Dave you're on the air welcome
[47:45.800 --> 47:49.600]  hi Alex thanks so much for taking my call I'm calling calling from Windsor
[47:49.600 --> 47:54.800]  we are change Windsor we've been quite busy here trying to keep active kind of
[47:54.800 --> 47:59.760]  wake people up yeah I'd like to see if I can ask you a couple questions first of
[47:59.760 --> 48:04.480]  all is it possible for me to just mention some issues that are going on in
[48:04.480 --> 48:07.760]  Canada and sir we didn't screen your call I mean if I don't like what you're
[48:07.760 --> 48:10.160]  getting into or I think it's a distraction or something I just
[48:10.160 --> 48:14.720]  hang up on people but yeah go ahead we welcome yeah the second call or the
[48:14.720 --> 48:18.120]  second issue is just went to website that we have anyway yeah in Canada here
[48:18.120 --> 48:20.800]  we we have a lot of things going on I don't want to make things seem too
[48:20.800 --> 48:24.320]  pessimistic but you know it is what it is so anyway we're having a lot of flat
[48:24.320 --> 48:29.720]  factory closures Navistar would last large truck manufacturing plant closed
[48:29.720 --> 48:34.520]  a little while ago you're enjoying the blessings of globalism yeah well remember
[48:34.520 --> 48:41.160]  Al Gore told you on Larry King live in 1994 Larry this is a good deal over the
[48:41.160 --> 48:45.560]  next 10 years it's going to double our factories Larry and again he wouldn't
[48:45.560 --> 48:51.440]  lie to us he's Al Gore he told us polar bears can't swim come now tisk tisk are
[48:51.440 --> 48:58.160]  you talking about about Al Gore yes I am okay please continue evil one so anyway
[48:58.160 --> 49:01.480]  yeah we're ready for right near Detroit as well so the other issues there's so
[49:01.480 --> 49:05.120]  many but like they are you gonna tell me next Detroit hadn't done great under
[49:05.120 --> 49:09.920]  napton yet oh it's done wonderful they want to build a new bridge just to
[49:09.920 --> 49:12.880]  accommodate all the all the increased traffic you know I'm being
[49:12.880 --> 49:17.120]  sarcastic obviously but that's another thing is that the studies show that the
[49:17.120 --> 49:20.600]  traffic is actually dropped since 2001 but they want to build another bridge
[49:20.600 --> 49:25.240]  another another crossing and the fighting with the government one private

[01:00:55.120 --> 01:01:00.960]  you doing good good I'm YouTube's father of my five we have a lot of videos that
[01:01:00.960 --> 01:01:06.560]  kind of parallel you were talking earlier about the recession and it kind
[01:01:06.560 --> 01:01:10.920]  of gets me wondering how much of our news is actually made in Hollywood I'm
[01:01:10.920 --> 01:01:15.160]  sitting here right now and I'm looking across the the way here and there is a
[01:01:15.160 --> 01:01:18.600]  casino being built and not just a little casino this is a really nice
[01:01:18.600 --> 01:01:23.920]  casino being built actively right now and as I travel around the country trying
[01:01:23.920 --> 01:01:29.160]  to you know get ideas for videos and and show things these really expensive
[01:01:29.160 --> 01:01:34.600]  hotels all the parking lots are full of cars I mean so I'm wondering about this
[01:01:34.600 --> 01:01:40.160]  recession a little if you've touched what I'm trying to well you know if you've
[01:01:40.160 --> 01:01:45.400]  lost your job it's a depression but if your neighbor just got a raise it's a
[01:01:45.400 --> 01:01:50.120]  boom time so these are all done in averages you know environmentalists
[01:01:50.120 --> 01:01:54.560]  will go out and aim a camera at San Diego's at water and say I don't see a
[01:01:54.560 --> 01:01:58.120]  great white shark their numbers are down but then you look at statistics where
[01:01:58.120 --> 01:02:03.920]  some areas their numbers are up you know economics is in averages and if you look
[01:02:03.920 --> 01:02:12.280]  at the overall averages the economy is in a depression for the last three years
[01:02:12.280 --> 01:02:16.800]  and we've had many economists down to break that down many restaurants I like
[01:02:16.800 --> 01:02:22.960]  to go to around a business prices are up inflation is increasing food stamps you
[01:02:22.960 --> 01:02:26.360]  know what was it just six seven years ago we had about 25 million on it now
[01:02:26.360 --> 01:02:29.600]  it's 45 million and then there's another five million or so they're on
[01:02:29.600 --> 01:02:34.680]  supplemental so it's almost 50 million so so those are all major numbers but
[01:02:34.680 --> 01:02:37.920]  yes there are people working for defense contractors and people working for
[01:02:37.920 --> 01:02:43.160]  government and people working for sectors of the economy that are good but
[01:02:43.160 --> 01:02:48.360]  there's also people gambling who are in there running up credit cards or
[01:02:48.360 --> 01:02:54.360]  spending their sons and daughters college fund on that so just because a
[01:02:54.360 --> 01:03:02.240]  casino has its you know parking lot full yeah I mean there's probably 50
[01:03:02.240 --> 01:03:08.240]  cars out there of young 20-year-old beauty queens who can't get a job or
[01:03:08.240 --> 01:03:12.320]  survive on a school teacher salary or as an accountant or as a scientist so
[01:03:12.320 --> 01:03:17.800]  she's in there doing you know sexual acts and and and daddy's in there 50
[01:03:17.800 --> 01:03:23.560]  something years old spending the kids college funds at the casino so I mean to
[01:03:23.560 --> 01:03:28.880]  say that you're seeing the economy look like it's doing great I mean I can I
[01:03:28.880 --> 01:03:35.200]  can take you down to a restaurant and show you every every area filled because
[01:03:35.200 --> 01:03:40.160]  it's popular but then I can go show you you know the housing numbers or whatever
[01:03:40.160 --> 01:03:46.280]  I mean it's a the economy isn't it's kind of like this we have more people
[01:03:46.280 --> 01:03:49.600]  today getting cancer than we did previously that's not the better diabetes
[01:03:49.600 --> 01:03:54.280]  now I can go show you a triathlete in perfect shape with bronze skin and six
[01:03:54.280 --> 01:03:58.480]  packed stomach and say I don't think diabetes is up in America this guy looks
[01:03:58.480 --> 01:04:02.280]  great but I can also take you to a bus stop where you know a third of the
[01:04:02.280 --> 01:04:07.360]  people I'd ride by and see have had their legs cut off because of it so again
[01:04:07.360 --> 01:04:12.320]  you don't just like spot check things to then say well that's that's where the
[01:04:12.320 --> 01:04:17.040]  economy is does that answer your question again kind of it's a little off
[01:04:17.040 --> 01:04:21.760]  but I'm comparing what the news says compared to what I'm seeing and I'm
[01:04:21.760 --> 01:04:25.920]  just I'm seeing casinos I'm seeing something else that I'm seeing well
[01:04:25.920 --> 01:04:30.480]  besides the cancer and diabetes I can go on and on about those is the racial
[01:04:30.480 --> 01:04:36.880]  thing you as I'm just as I'm traveling through California I'm noticing a lot of
[01:04:36.880 --> 01:04:42.040]  churches that are talking about stop the black on black violence but I don't
[01:04:42.040 --> 01:04:45.440]  understand why it has to be black on black violence why can't it just be

[01:06:03.280 --> 01:06:07.480]  buying a solar power generator number one new climate legislation could easily
[01:06:07.480 --> 01:06:11.720]  double or triple your electric bill number two our new energies are wants
[01:06:11.720 --> 01:06:15.640]  to control how much power your electric company allows you to have it's true
[01:06:15.640 --> 01:06:19.280]  total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid
[01:06:19.280 --> 01:06:23.840]  technology is coming number three in some areas of the country the power grid is
[01:06:23.840 --> 01:06:27.880]  dangerously overloaded and now new socialist legislation is only
[01:06:27.880 --> 01:06:31.680]  compounding the problem number four dangerous weather is always a threat to
[01:06:31.680 --> 01:06:35.280]  local grids every year thousands of families lose their power from weather
[01:06:35.280 --> 01:06:39.640]  related onages number five a solar power generator provides powerful backup

[01:08:19.280 --> 01:08:24.000]  Chapman of the international forecaster incredible economic analyst joining us as
[01:08:24.000 --> 01:08:28.400]  he does every Friday with a little treat today because I like to combo up our
[01:08:28.400 --> 01:08:32.880]  regular guest from time to time in the second half of the interview Dr. Paul
[01:08:32.880 --> 01:08:36.920]  Craig Roberts former head of policy at the Treasury Department under Reagan the
[01:08:36.920 --> 01:08:41.040]  father of Reaganomics former Wall Street Journal editor he has pointed out
[01:08:41.040 --> 01:08:44.960]  that raising the debt ceiling and lowering it it's all a distraction from
[01:08:44.960 --> 01:08:49.360]  the derivatives and the offshoring of jobs and so we're going to get his
[01:08:49.360 --> 01:08:55.120]  economic outlook with both those men together coming up today very excited
[01:08:55.120 --> 01:08:59.600]  about that I will continue with your calls interspersed with little nuggets
[01:08:59.600 --> 01:09:05.160]  of news and I just had a caller if you just joined us Ken in California and
[01:09:05.160 --> 01:09:08.520]  we're going to Tanner Dusty Sheldon Mike and others and by the way the toll
[01:09:08.520 --> 01:09:17.400]  for amber to join us is 800 259 9231 and I haven't covered the subject a lot
[01:09:17.400 --> 01:09:23.360]  that Ken mentioned because I'm not shying away from it I do have a problem
[01:09:23.360 --> 01:09:31.880]  and that is when something's really really complex and I understand it but
[01:09:31.880 --> 01:09:37.080]  it's hard to explain unless I spent two hours on it kind of going into that
[01:09:37.080 --> 01:09:41.680]  public brainstorm mode where I just talk endlessly for a couple hours and you've
[01:09:41.680 --> 01:09:45.600]  seen those shows happen and the show's over and I've basically rattled on for
[01:09:45.600 --> 01:09:49.840]  a couple hours about something hitting every different angle of it because
[01:09:49.840 --> 01:09:55.280]  there's so many subjects like that there are a lot of subjects that I need to
[01:09:55.280 --> 01:09:58.960]  learn the gift of just basically trying to simplify my view on it if somebody's
[01:09:58.960 --> 01:10:04.000]  asking my opinion and so now I'll try to spend two or three minutes because I
[01:10:04.000 --> 01:10:09.720]  want to go to your calls on this subject and that is black on white crime and
[01:10:09.720 --> 01:10:15.840]  every time I do mention this I get emails and stuff and calls from black
[01:10:15.840 --> 01:10:20.400]  folks saying Alex I thought you know you cared about us what why are you saying
[01:10:20.400 --> 01:10:26.360]  that that isn't true well you know I'm against 52% of black people being
[01:10:26.360 --> 01:10:30.440]  imported I don't like killing kids okay and at the end of the day I don't
[01:10:30.440 --> 01:10:35.920]  dislike black people but at the end of the day I grew up in Dallas Texas and
[01:10:35.920 --> 01:10:39.440]  had a lot of black friends I was on the football team with but I also was
[01:10:39.440 --> 01:10:44.720]  racially attacked I don't know probably ten times probably more actually black
[01:10:44.720 --> 01:10:50.480]  folks and hey I actually appreciate it I mean those are some of the best
[01:10:50.480 --> 01:10:55.120]  experiences of my life now okay I mean that that has made me who I am today that
[01:10:55.120 --> 01:11:00.360]  I have been in absolute knockdown drag out you know where I go to the hospital
[01:11:00.360 --> 01:11:04.360]  they go to the hospital that's valuable to me my permanent black eyes are
[01:11:04.360 --> 01:11:09.360]  valuable you know the broken leg I got the fights valuable the time I got
[01:11:09.360 --> 01:11:14.440]  stabbed is valuable all of its very valuable because I'm not the toughest
[01:11:14.440 --> 01:11:18.080]  guy in the world but I've been in some hellacious fights and it's valuable to
[01:11:18.080 --> 01:11:22.040]  me I don't hate black people just because I've been racially attacked over
[01:11:22.040 --> 01:11:27.880]  and over again okay I've had Mexicans racially attacked me or Mexicans five
[01:11:27.880 --> 01:11:31.480]  technically but only four were pounding on me and calling me racial names while
[01:11:31.480 --> 01:11:35.680]  they did it and then I tore up a couple of them real bad and they got scared and
[01:11:35.680 --> 01:11:40.840]  really hurt me even worse they thought they had you know a rhinoceros on them
[01:11:40.840 --> 01:11:44.800]  because the truth is folks I can't even I have no strength until I'm overwhelmed
[01:11:44.800 --> 01:11:49.200]  and then it's it's it's it's it's clobbering time and that's the way it is
[01:11:49.200 --> 01:11:53.000]  with anybody that's why as a species we're not gonna be able to stand up to
[01:11:53.000 --> 01:12:00.440]  tyranny until things get really bad okay it's real simple and I also got my
[01:12:00.440 --> 01:12:06.800]  teeth loosened and my nose broken by rednecks as well everybody's tribal
[01:12:06.800 --> 01:12:11.320]  you know you pull up to a bonfire to lake you don't know most of people they're
[01:12:11.320 --> 01:12:15.160]  tribal big old white guys come over wearing their you know their wranglers
[01:12:15.160 --> 01:12:20.120]  and their cowboy boats and they're like what are you doing here Yankee and they
[01:12:20.120 --> 01:12:24.200]  start a fight with you and then later you learn you pulled in and there was
[01:12:24.200 --> 01:12:31.560]  some clan people there oh yes that goes on in places like East Texas okay so I've
[01:12:31.560 --> 01:12:36.840]  been attacked by the clan I've been attacked by black people I've been
[01:12:36.840 --> 01:12:39.840]  attacked by Mexicans and let me tell you who I've been attacked by I've been
[01:12:39.840 --> 01:12:43.800]  attacked by tribalist it didn't matter if they were white if they were black if
[01:12:43.800 --> 01:12:51.760]  they were Mexican I have been attacked for being an outsider by whites pulling
[01:12:51.760 --> 01:12:55.880]  in a pickup truck with a girl a little too good-looking and I was a little too
[01:12:55.880 --> 01:13:00.280]  good-looking for him at that time I know I'm not too good-looking now and I've
[01:13:00.280 --> 01:13:05.000]  experienced all that so when I hear about black people in gangs beating and
[01:13:05.000 --> 01:13:08.920]  robbing whites all over the U.S. I see it in the news every day and the media
[01:13:08.920 --> 01:13:13.040]  tries to not say it's racial but then there's the facts it's horrible it's
[01:13:13.040 --> 01:13:16.960]  terrible but then do I see a black person and hate them no because most black
[01:13:16.960 --> 01:13:22.800]  people aren't like that and most people wearing Stetson cowboy hats aren't you
[01:13:22.800 --> 01:13:28.560]  know in some little clan gang or something you know and again people most
[01:13:28.560 --> 01:13:35.760]  Mexicans are not looking to beat the living I mean I went to the hospital
[01:13:35.760 --> 01:13:41.800]  folks they'll beat the living daylight and stomp me in from in I mean I've had
[01:13:41.800 --> 01:13:49.320]  I've had I've had concussions you know that I couldn't see for two days okay
[01:13:49.320 --> 01:13:52.960]  you know I'm brain damage you better get it right I've been hit up outside the
[01:13:52.960 --> 01:13:57.160]  head with an axe handle a lead pipe the whole night and I shouldn't even get
[01:13:57.160 --> 01:14:00.920]  into these stories the point is anybody who grew up in Dallas folks knows
[01:14:00.920 --> 01:14:05.440]  that's the culture up there it is just absolute you know don't call the cops
[01:14:05.440 --> 01:14:08.960]  unless somebody's dead I actually like Austin where it's the fighting isn't
[01:14:08.960 --> 01:14:12.720]  put up with people start fights with me now I say yes sir mister you're big and
[01:14:12.720 --> 01:14:16.640]  tough unless my family's around and then you better watch out but see I said I
[01:14:16.640 --> 01:14:21.000]  spent two or three minutes on this how do I describe what's going on black
[01:14:21.000 --> 01:14:26.120]  people feel entitled on average the type of groups that are attacking folks they
[01:14:26.120 --> 01:14:30.560]  feel like they've been victimized they feel like they're the only slaves who
[01:14:30.560 --> 01:14:33.720]  ever were in the history of the world they don't know history just like
[01:14:33.720 --> 01:14:38.240]  everybody else on average and they're very full of themselves the type that
[01:14:38.240 --> 01:14:44.120]  attack whites they don't see it as racist when they grab people's purses and
[01:14:44.120 --> 01:14:49.360]  punch old ladies in the nose and stomp on you know somebody calling them
[01:14:49.360 --> 01:14:54.880]  calling them white cracker okay do you think a clan person whenever they attack
[01:14:54.880 --> 01:14:57.800]  a black person feels like they're being evil no they think they're in the right
[01:14:57.800 --> 01:15:02.380]  to do you think a La Raza person you know going out engaging in racial
[01:15:02.380 --> 01:15:04.560]  attacks on whites we got video that stuff stuff
[01:15:04.560 --> 01:15:10.320]  mecha type people no they're in a war against the you know the devil see so
[01:15:10.320 --> 01:15:17.320]  so this is gonna get worse we're a tribal country football coke Pepsi Ford
[01:15:17.320 --> 01:15:21.240]  Chevy I mean that's tribalism that people that like Ford had a little image
[01:15:21.240 --> 01:15:25.320]  of the of the guy urinating on the Chevy symbol or vice versa you've all
[01:15:25.320 --> 01:15:29.880]  seen it that's what it's all about ladies and gentlemen that's what I'm not
[01:15:29.880 --> 01:15:32.960]  against tattoos I'm not against guys with the shaved heads and the goatees
[01:15:32.960 --> 01:15:36.600]  you know that you see everywhere black white Hispanic trying to act tough I'm
[01:15:36.600 --> 01:15:40.640]  scared of people that want to act tough I'm scared of people that want to fight
[01:15:40.640 --> 01:15:45.080]  because they haven't been hurt bad enough yet they haven't rolled around with
[01:15:45.080 --> 01:15:49.440]  somebody pushing a knife into them okay they haven't been there they haven't been
[01:15:49.440 --> 01:15:54.440]  in the big Dallas Jails they haven't had the jail guards try to rape them they
[01:15:54.440 --> 01:15:58.280]  haven't lived yet they want to be gangster and they don't know what it is
[01:15:58.280 --> 01:16:05.280]  okay it's that simple and so the culture sells that gangsterism and all this
[01:16:05.280 --> 01:16:09.280]  garbage is cool and so the white kids do it the black kids do it you name it
[01:16:09.280 --> 01:16:13.240]  they do it and you get these welfare generation for generation of people and
[01:16:13.240 --> 01:16:19.400]  all over the country yes yes it happens I had black guys three years ago at the
[01:16:19.400 --> 01:16:23.720]  TSA make fun of me and call me names because I was white and get off on it
[01:16:23.720 --> 01:16:28.480]  and that basically asked me if I wanted some trouble I've told that story and I
[01:16:28.480 --> 01:16:32.080]  just you know what I just I just basically I griped at him a little bit
[01:16:32.080 --> 01:16:37.120]  but just got on through the line because the point is is that I feel sorry for
[01:16:37.120 --> 01:16:40.080]  those type of people now if they physically do something you got to
[01:16:40.080 --> 01:16:45.600]  defend yourself but I do not sit there when a racist black person is racist
[01:16:45.600 --> 01:16:51.600]  towards me and hate black people because of it okay any more than I see
[01:16:51.600 --> 01:16:55.920]  somebody wearing Wranglers and a cowboy hat because I've probably been in it's
[01:16:55.920 --> 01:17:01.560]  pretty embarrassing actually only fights I've been in I was probably in ten or
[01:17:01.560 --> 01:17:05.560]  more fights with rednecks and I mean I'm not bad folks that are you know work
[01:17:05.560 --> 01:17:09.240]  in the country I'm from redneck stock myself if you want to call it that the
[01:17:09.240 --> 01:17:16.680]  point is is that I'm not looking for trouble with people okay and and it's
[01:17:16.680 --> 01:17:20.640]  very sad and it's gonna get worse because through multiculturalism they've
[01:17:20.640 --> 01:17:24.840]  actually created more tribalism it's all about what color you are what sexual
[01:17:24.840 --> 01:17:32.640]  preference what you're into what you do it's not about what you do it's about
[01:17:32.640 --> 01:17:39.360]  how you look and what group you're in okay I'm in the free humanity group who
[01:17:39.360 --> 01:17:44.720]  wants prosperity and to be left alone and have a decent life okay that's
[01:17:44.720 --> 01:17:51.000]  that's the group I'm in I'm into freedom I'm into 1776 and no matter whether
[01:17:51.000 --> 01:17:55.520]  you're Mexican black Latin American Chinese I don't care you're under
[01:17:55.520 --> 01:18:01.680]  eugenics New World Order attack and yes it is dangerous and it's getting worse
[01:18:01.680 --> 01:18:05.760]  because the media all over the country it's happening in Florida Illinois
[01:18:05.760 --> 01:18:12.120]  Wisconsin Dallas when blacks attack white people the media will not call it
[01:18:12.120 --> 01:18:18.680]  out for what it is and so the people will be doing it feel like it's okay they
[01:18:18.680 --> 01:18:25.840]  feel like it's okay they they feel like that it's no big deal and you know a lot
[01:18:25.840 --> 01:18:30.000]  of times the poor of the group too they'll tell you it's poor whites that
[01:18:30.000 --> 01:18:33.240]  ended up being in the Klan most the time it's the same thing with blacks poor
[01:18:33.240 --> 01:18:36.760]  blacks end up being in these gangs the prisons oh that's the other big issue
[01:18:36.760 --> 01:18:41.280]  what do you think the prisons are the government segregates everybody
[01:18:41.280 --> 01:18:45.000]  according to race they say because they have to and they pretty much do because
[01:18:45.000 --> 01:18:48.320]  that's just the way humans are and then it gets worse and worse the Aryan
[01:18:48.320 --> 01:18:51.900]  nations there's so few white people left in this country and in prison the
[01:18:51.900 --> 01:18:56.320]  Aryan nations now takes people who are black Hispanic Asian whatever as long
[01:18:56.320 --> 01:19:00.280]  as their mother is white they're like following Jewish law or something I mean
[01:19:00.280 --> 01:19:05.600]  it's ridiculous I've got family in East Texas folks there aren't any jobs left
[01:19:05.600 --> 01:19:09.000]  who are jailguards and they will tell you they've turned the air conditioning
[01:19:09.000 --> 01:19:12.780]  off the last few years people that lie and say prisons have got hot tubs and
[01:19:12.780 --> 01:19:17.320]  cable it and true it and true they've turned the air conditioning off you know
[01:19:17.320 --> 01:19:21.280]  I was just talking to my dad who talked to my cousin the other day it's like a
[01:19:21.280 --> 01:19:25.560]  hundred and fifteen degrees in the in the in the prison he works at right now and
[01:19:25.560 --> 01:19:32.200]  almost everybody's quitting and it is just a hell pit of evil we have the
[01:19:32.200 --> 01:19:36.280]  biggest prison population in the world it's a college for this and you send a
[01:19:36.280 --> 01:19:40.560]  white kid a black kid a Hispanic kid into prison if they don't join the racial
[01:19:40.560 --> 01:19:45.760]  gangs they're dead so why are the blacks running around because most of these
[01:19:45.760 --> 01:19:49.520]  blacks doing this have been in juvenile Hall or prison and that's what they
[01:19:49.520 --> 01:19:53.360]  know that's why they're doing this does that make them any less dangerous no
[01:19:53.360 --> 01:19:57.280]  they're dangerous as you know what and this country's gonna fall apart it's

[01:24:18.360 --> 01:24:24.520]  by the way while I'm on this gang stuff I don't dislike the average police
[01:24:24.520 --> 01:24:29.160]  officer individually any more than I dislike a black person because there
[01:24:29.160 --> 01:24:32.440]  are racist black people that think it's their right to beat up white people
[01:24:32.440 --> 01:24:38.080]  because they're white or vice versa but it's I saw this case a few weeks ago
[01:24:38.080 --> 01:24:42.080]  we've shown the photo we ought to dig it up I was gonna cover it again yesterday
[01:24:42.080 --> 01:24:46.160]  where the homeless guy hadn't done anything wrong and the witnesses all saw
[01:24:46.160 --> 01:24:51.200]  it and they beat him for like five minutes and we're doing knee drops on his
[01:24:51.200 --> 01:24:55.840]  head and tasered him six times and then he died a day later I mean just a
[01:24:55.840 --> 01:25:02.360]  completely bloody mass and now police inside have leaked the fact that the
[01:25:02.360 --> 01:25:06.440]  police control system zoomed in on the street cam that's right above it that
[01:25:06.440 --> 01:25:11.240]  they won't release as entertainment while they were beating their gun butts
[01:25:11.240 --> 01:25:16.200]  into his head and blood was just splattering everywhere that's a gang
[01:25:16.200 --> 01:25:21.160]  attack I mean look you go around the wrong people the wrong culture they want
[01:25:21.160 --> 01:25:25.200]  to fight you and they're cowards and they want to do it when they got you
[01:25:25.200 --> 01:25:30.240]  outnumbered five to one whether it was rednecks or whether it was illegal
[01:25:30.240 --> 01:25:36.040]  aliens or whether it was black racist or whether it's cops it's the same thing
[01:25:36.040 --> 01:25:40.320]  now does that mean all the cops are like that or all the white people are like
[01:25:40.320 --> 01:25:46.960]  that or all that no no but we do need to speak out against it you know my gosh
[01:25:46.960 --> 01:25:53.600]  if if a couple of white guys beat a gay guy up to death it is like the end of
[01:25:53.600 --> 01:25:58.200]  the world and it's wrong that that happens it's like the end of the world
[01:25:58.200 --> 01:26:04.560]  and cause celeb because it's a protected group you remember the case out in
[01:26:04.560 --> 01:26:08.200]  east Texas where they drug the black guy to death the two Aryan nations people
[01:26:08.200 --> 01:26:11.480]  by the way they were given the death penalty and the government tried to pass
[01:26:11.480 --> 01:26:19.000]  using that hate speech laws to restrict free speech remember that and then of
[01:26:19.000 --> 01:26:25.560]  course it did not get reported that well it got reported but not nationally that
[01:26:25.560 --> 01:26:31.000]  that guy was the leader of the rival gang at the prison they'd been at for
[01:26:31.000 --> 01:26:37.080]  years so really it wasn't even it was racial but not in the classic racial it
[01:26:37.080 --> 01:26:43.280]  was gang on gang and then it turned out a year after that some black gang
[01:26:43.280 --> 01:26:48.480]  bangers pulled over a homeless white guy walking down the road who had never
[01:26:48.480 --> 01:26:54.400]  been in prison with him and to get back whitey they drug him to death and the
[01:26:54.400 --> 01:26:58.120]  media didn't even cover it it was in the Associated Press and that was it just a
[01:26:58.120 --> 01:27:04.240]  little blurb now again what's worse dragon a hobo you don't even know or
[01:27:04.240 --> 01:27:08.560]  dragon a rival gang person you're in a fight with the death I think it's all
[01:27:08.560 --> 01:27:13.880]  as bad but in jurors prudence the fact that they knew him and had been in
[01:27:13.880 --> 01:27:19.120]  gang wars with his same gang I mean what do you expect to come out of these
[01:27:19.120 --> 01:27:24.400]  prisons so it's terrible but this is what we're creating this is what America's
[01:27:24.400 --> 01:27:27.800]  becoming that's what they're filling the military now with they mean they've
[01:27:27.800 --> 01:27:33.640]  even had CNBC specials where entire units are certain gangs and get in
[01:27:33.640 --> 01:27:38.040]  fights with each other over in Iraq you got this black gang fighting this
[01:27:38.040 --> 01:27:41.880]  Hispanic gang and this Hispanic gang fighting them and this gang killing that
[01:27:41.880 --> 01:27:48.480]  gang that's humans are tribal we are gang oriented and we better get a hold of
[01:27:48.480 --> 01:27:53.320]  this gang mentality you know I'm part of a gang I believe in property rights the
[01:27:53.320 --> 01:27:57.720]  right to defend yourself the right to do process the right to national
[01:27:57.720 --> 01:28:01.080]  sovereignty the right to not have foreign banks come in or and take us over
[01:28:01.080 --> 01:28:06.200]  and rule us see I'm part of the 1776 gang and I don't care what color you are
[01:28:06.200 --> 01:28:09.480]  I want to know what's in your heart what's in your mind I want to know if you
[01:28:09.480 --> 01:28:14.280]  burn for liberty and freedom or if you are one of the chumps that wants to be

[01:28:19.960 --> 01:28:24.240]  a general motorcycle gang look I don't care as long as the gang you're in has
[01:28:24.240 --> 01:28:32.120]  values that are congruent with historical common sense in reality in fact
[01:28:32.120 --> 01:28:37.240]  gangs can be a good thing what do you think the Tea Party is it's why it
[01:28:37.240 --> 01:28:41.520]  scares the system so much why they sent the Republicans in to take it over but
[01:28:41.520 --> 01:28:44.640]  they haven't been totally successful and so they're now coming out saying this
[01:28:44.640 --> 01:28:51.400]  gang is gonna blow stuff up so they can use the military against that gang so
[01:28:51.400 --> 01:28:57.120]  yeah I get gangs I understand gangs and you know here are the reports and we'll

[01:32:57.120 --> 01:33:01.400]  eFoodsDirect.com forward slash Alex
[01:33:06.760 --> 01:33:13.880]  today is gonna be the day that they're gonna throw it back to you by now you
[01:33:13.880 --> 01:33:20.280]  should have somehow realized what you gotta do I don't believe that anybody
[01:33:20.280 --> 01:33:31.760]  feels the way I do about you now we're gonna raise this news with Bob Chapin
[01:33:31.760 --> 01:33:35.720]  when he comes in start of the next hour Italian prosecutors probing ratings
[01:33:35.720 --> 01:33:42.120]  agency Moody's and S&P after consumer groups complain they raided the offices
[01:33:42.120 --> 01:33:46.520]  now Tarpley told us about this I don't know three weeks ago and I don't know
[01:33:46.520 --> 01:33:52.240]  this is new because even though this is in a whole bunch of mainstream newspapers
[01:33:52.240 --> 01:33:56.960]  they don't really give details but obviously they're asking why is Moody's
[01:33:56.960 --> 01:34:01.240]  and S&P downgrading Italy but not downgrading the US when according to a
[01:34:01.240 --> 01:34:05.480]  lot of metrics the US is in worse financial shape than Europe so we're
[01:34:05.480 --> 01:34:11.280]  gonna be going over that obviously the big news Russian envoy to NATO says
[01:34:11.280 --> 01:34:15.880]  NATO is planning attacks on Syria and Iran because they're trying to get Russia
[01:34:15.880 --> 01:34:20.560]  to go along with it and what did Mark Fawber said he said this imploding
[01:34:20.560 --> 01:34:24.120]  economy they're gonna launch a new war got no kidding they've got our troops
[01:34:24.120 --> 01:34:29.720]  deployed over there ready for it and they're not gonna probably have to
[01:34:29.720 --> 01:34:34.040]  stage terror attacks of the attack Iran Iran's gonna strike back and they're
[01:34:34.040 --> 01:34:37.120]  going to use that to take our liberties and then they'll probably stage
[01:34:37.120 --> 01:34:40.400]  something and claim tea party people are involved with Iran that'll be the
[01:34:40.400 --> 01:34:44.680]  staged event you can see all the preconditioning I'm telling you we're
[01:34:44.680 --> 01:34:50.960]  in grave danger danger will Robinson danger really Robbie where is the
[01:34:50.960 --> 01:34:55.680]  danger coming from the district of criminals doctor what was the name of
[01:34:55.680 --> 01:34:59.560]  the family doctor whatever I forget the name of the family only seen that show
[01:34:59.560 --> 01:35:07.720]  like once but since I mentioned this I thought I'd show it to you and then
[01:35:07.720 --> 01:35:15.120]  we'll go to your calls Arctic tipping point may not be reached and it's BBC
[01:35:15.120 --> 01:35:19.080]  news site to say current concerns over tipping point and the disappearance of
[01:35:19.080 --> 01:35:24.920]  ice sea ice may have been misplaced Danish researchers analyzed ancient pieces
[01:35:24.920 --> 01:35:28.360]  of driftwood to north Greenland which they say is an accurate way to measure
[01:35:28.360 --> 01:35:33.800]  the extent of ancient ice flows yeah this is the stuff buried and swamp bogs
[01:35:33.800 --> 01:35:37.200]  and the rest of it think carbon data writing in the Journal of Science the
[01:35:37.200 --> 01:35:43.640]  team found that evidence that ice levels are about 50 percent lower 5,000
[01:35:43.640 --> 01:35:51.240]  years ago than they are today now let's just stop there this is all 50 plus year
[01:35:51.240 --> 01:35:54.680]  old news I mean this has been duplicated that I know of hundreds of times
[01:35:54.680 --> 01:35:58.520]  which probably means it's thousands I don't know how many times that they've
[01:35:58.520 --> 01:36:02.200]  done the peat bogs they've done the ice cores they've done the driftwood they've
[01:36:02.200 --> 01:36:09.160]  done all sorts of extractions they've dug up ice age man 10,000 plus years bronze
[01:36:09.160 --> 01:36:15.240]  age 9,000 hiberium maximum they know oh by the way I forgot to cover that they
[01:36:15.240 --> 01:36:19.560]  found thousands of miles of tunnels from Turkey to England even under the
[01:36:19.560 --> 01:36:23.240]  English Channel you print me that it's incredible man-made tunnels all over
[01:36:23.240 --> 01:36:26.880]  Europe we have no idea about our real history I'm just gonna leave it at that
[01:36:26.880 --> 01:36:32.280]  the discoveries they found what 17 new pyramids hidden under the desert in
[01:36:32.280 --> 01:36:37.880]  Egypt I mean we don't know what's going on just cuz they tell you what history is
[01:36:37.880 --> 01:36:44.040]  we don't know and people say well then it's this no I don't know people ask me
[01:36:44.040 --> 01:36:54.520]  and my answer is I don't know I don't know you know that song all I know is
[01:36:54.520 --> 01:37:06.880]  you've got to believe in foolish miracles it's not how you well I'm side
[01:37:06.880 --> 01:37:10.640]  issue I'm now digressing here I said I go to your calls in the Arctic tipping
[01:37:10.640 --> 01:37:15.880]  point so you've got that piece of news here they've always known this they've
[01:37:15.880 --> 01:37:22.480]  always known this stuff in modern history they've understood it okay yeah
[01:37:22.480 --> 01:37:26.120]  there it is experts baffle by mysterious underground chambers now no this is
[01:37:26.120 --> 01:37:29.600]  this is Daily Mail that's their spiegel the Daily Mail's got to get the huge
[01:37:29.600 --> 01:37:34.400]  photos and all the super powerful stuff in it thank you though great job you
[01:37:34.400 --> 01:37:39.280]  guys are getting better and better at finding stuff faster than I can okay can
[01:37:39.280 --> 01:37:43.960]  I just make a coherent point here why do I say this isn't new news well they've
[01:37:43.960 --> 01:37:49.680]  got the ice cores they've had the peat bog data they know also from the flows
[01:37:49.680 --> 01:37:56.360]  of the glacial rock deposits the alluvial deposits they know what's going on
[01:37:56.360 --> 01:38:06.400]  and they know from the text that have been found what's been happening but I
[01:38:06.400 --> 01:38:10.760]  go back to this why suddenly are you hearing them go actually the Sun's
[01:38:10.760 --> 01:38:14.880]  controlling the temperature of the earth actually cosmic radiations forming the
[01:38:14.880 --> 01:38:21.000]  clouds actually carbon dioxide goes up after the heat goes up they knew that
[01:38:21.000 --> 01:38:25.840]  decades ago in all the major ice core studies and people exposed Al Gore what
[01:38:25.840 --> 01:38:30.360]  three years ago and pulled it out of the British schools his video when he put
[01:38:30.360 --> 01:38:34.600]  the carbon dioxide first and temperature rise after he just flipped the graphs I
[01:38:34.600 --> 01:38:40.360]  mean very simple scam why wouldn't anybody report this because you would be
[01:38:40.360 --> 01:38:44.480]  beat over the head if you did but now legions of scientists are coming out
[01:38:44.480 --> 01:38:49.360]  with their findings that were already available it's just now they've imploded
[01:38:49.360 --> 01:38:55.960]  69% RAS music poll say it's a fraud they're being lied to that's what's
[01:38:55.960 --> 01:39:00.960]  happening and I see these reports all the time now because polar bear numbers
[01:39:00.960 --> 01:39:05.560]  have doubled the last 10 years they're up five fold since the 1950s you can pull
[01:39:05.560 --> 01:39:10.120]  those numbers up and James Dilling pull the telegraph corrected me last week I
[01:39:10.120 --> 01:39:13.560]  said well there's a double fold in the last 50 he goes no no that's the last
[01:39:13.560 --> 01:39:18.120]  10 years it's five times and I went and looked it up oh wow so again worse than I
[01:39:18.120 --> 01:39:24.360]  said worse than I was saying and by worse is these things are overrunning
[01:39:24.360 --> 01:39:30.040]  everywhere polar bear kills British boy in Arctic and see humans would always
[01:39:30.040 --> 01:39:34.520]  hunt polar bears so that they knew who was boss and would not come into town
[01:39:34.520 --> 01:39:38.760]  and start eating our kids but now you don't hunt Puma's you don't hunt wolves
[01:39:38.760 --> 01:39:42.240]  you don't hunt Grizzlies and then we heard about a grizzly killing somebody
[01:39:42.240 --> 01:39:46.800]  last week it's it's it's dinner time oh these people run from us these people
[01:39:46.800 --> 01:39:50.720]  don't hunt us well we eat them then and they love getting your head and crunching
[01:39:50.720 --> 01:39:55.120]  the top off and slurping those brains out polar bear kills British boy in
[01:39:55.120 --> 01:39:59.560]  Arctic a polar bear has mauled a 17-year-old British boy to death in the
[01:39:59.560 --> 01:40:04.000]  Arctic and injured four other UK tourists oh you were you trying to keep
[01:40:04.000 --> 01:40:09.600]  them from drowning there thing friendly bear there when a grizzly sees a polar
[01:40:09.600 --> 01:40:16.760]  bear runs the other direction and Horatio Chappelle was one of 13 that's
[01:40:16.760 --> 01:40:22.960]  so sad mainly ages 16 23 on British school exploring society trip near the
[01:40:22.960 --> 01:40:30.440]  glacier of the Norwegian island of seven salva barred time to kill them time to
[01:40:30.440 --> 01:40:35.240]  kill some polar bears and you notice last time I checked they may have killed it
[01:40:35.240 --> 01:40:38.520]  now they decided not to kill the grizzly that attacked and killed the man and tried
[01:40:38.520 --> 01:40:43.160]  to kill the woman okay well they're gonna start eating us I mean if you don't
[01:40:43.160 --> 01:40:47.720]  act like a predator you become prey you look like a can of pork and beans on the
[01:40:47.720 --> 01:40:51.760]  shelf to one of these things okay let me check the stocks and then I'll go to
[01:40:51.760 --> 01:40:59.080]  your calls here I've even gotten any of the news yet here today I feel great but
[01:40:59.080 --> 01:41:06.080]  TJIF it's Friday as they as they like to say give you some of the financial
[01:41:06.080 --> 01:41:09.400]  numbers before we go then I'm gonna hurry through your calls I sure hope the
[01:41:09.400 --> 01:41:13.480]  stock market's going up oh it is it's up 64 points so the plunge protection team
[01:41:13.480 --> 01:41:18.400]  took it up from 200 minus to 64 points above yesterday's close and it's keeping
[01:41:18.400 --> 01:41:22.960]  it right there in the inside ball rigged game but hey we're all connected to it
[01:41:22.960 --> 01:41:28.560]  so I don't want it to go down these idiots send me emails and go open all
[01:41:28.560 --> 01:41:31.840]  implodes I don't care if the stock market dies I don't have any money in the
[01:41:31.840 --> 01:41:37.960]  stock market the companies most of us work for Ted isn't a public company and
[01:41:37.960 --> 01:41:41.480]  I'm not involved in his company so I have my own company but most people and
[01:41:41.480 --> 01:41:45.520]  most companies I do business with are publicly traded and that's where they
[01:41:45.520 --> 01:41:50.320]  get a lot of their money and then and fund new operations and so yeah the
[01:41:50.320 --> 01:41:56.320]  stock market tanks we're in deep trouble but they're devaluing the dollar which
[01:41:56.320 --> 01:42:00.760]  increases prices they've restored our industrial base and all we've got that
[01:42:00.760 --> 01:42:04.480]  stupid stock market left the stock market should be a small part of our
[01:42:04.480 --> 01:42:08.440]  overall economy but now it's everything so they can hold us hostage with that
[01:42:08.440 --> 01:42:13.800]  stinking thing okay I'm gonna shut up now Tanner in Texas you're on the year
[01:42:13.800 --> 01:42:18.600]  go ahead hey how's it going good buddies thanks for holding hey yeah
[01:42:18.600 --> 01:42:22.600]  yeah again from Texas I'm pretty sure you remember me the other day talking
[01:42:22.600 --> 01:42:26.920]  about how they set the video from Bloomberg private on the 3.3 trillion in
[01:42:26.920 --> 01:42:34.520]  backdoor bailouts yes but you can find those news articles you can anyway look
[01:42:34.520 --> 01:42:38.280]  I got it set back public but my point is this and I'm not gonna try to draw these
[01:42:38.280 --> 01:42:43.320]  conclusions myself but I wanted to get your opinion on it I have proven in my
[01:42:43.320 --> 01:42:47.120]  YouTube channel where I uploaded these videos and that's let's talk politics no
[01:42:47.120 --> 01:42:51.880]  apostrophe and instead of see it CS and X and for anybody who questions what I'm
[01:42:51.880 --> 01:42:54.360]  saying here please go and see for yourself now that there is YouTube
[01:42:54.360 --> 01:43:00.960]  censorship yes or please okay look on on the 11th I sent an email where you
[01:43:00.960 --> 01:43:04.880]  could legibly read this report you could see that it was being censored
[01:43:04.880 --> 01:43:08.320]  because I favorited the video so therefore I understand we we've this is
[01:43:08.320 --> 01:43:12.760]  our second time talking about it what's going on with it okay on the 11th is
[01:43:12.760 --> 01:43:17.120]  when I sent out the email I proved that in my in my channel that was the exact
[01:43:17.120 --> 01:43:21.160]  same day the view count issues began having problems on YouTube and they
[01:43:21.160 --> 01:43:26.240]  ended on the 8th which was ending the two-day get a window gap that it could
[01:43:26.240 --> 01:43:30.000]  have possibly ended up in the most few videos of the day so therefore make it
[01:43:30.000 --> 01:43:34.720]  go more viral which I uploaded you're thinking you're thinking YouTube I'm
[01:43:34.720 --> 01:43:38.480]  not saying that I'm saying well sir they would have just deleted it for copyright
[01:43:38.480 --> 01:43:41.600]  infringement but I hear you and I appreciate your call do you have any
[01:43:41.600 --> 01:43:46.840]  comments about all the stuff that's happening I know oh on the are you
[01:43:46.840 --> 01:43:51.400]  talking about the gangster culture and stuff like that yes Tanner well let me
[01:43:51.400 --> 01:43:56.440]  let me tell you like this Liberty is the only term in the declaration of
[01:43:56.440 --> 01:43:59.680]  independence that has an objective definition and that definition is
[01:43:59.680 --> 01:44:03.760]  without restraint and we are Republic which means we're bound to that document
[01:44:03.760 --> 01:44:08.240]  therefore nobody has the actual authority to enforce your sobriety
[01:44:08.240 --> 01:44:13.440]  therefore you know the fact that it's increased drug use increased homicide I
[01:44:13.440 --> 01:44:16.480]  mean we got a million people in privately on prison over a million people
[01:44:16.480 --> 01:44:21.000]  I believe that Leo in prison or the war on drugs you know and it's created this
[01:44:21.000 --> 01:44:25.680]  whole culture of gang activity corruption no it has I know I'm so sick of
[01:44:25.680 --> 01:44:30.720]  people trying to dress like gangsters just everywhere every race every color
[01:44:30.720 --> 01:44:36.280]  every religion and it's so pathetic and they're so wimpy and it's just it's
[01:44:36.280 --> 01:44:39.880]  just the dirtiest thing you can imagine and it's all been designed I mean we
[01:44:39.880 --> 01:44:44.760]  have these are colleges of corruption Tanner I appreciate your call by the way
[01:44:44.760 --> 01:44:49.320]  I have a Fox business article talking about media matters and there are
[01:44:49.320 --> 01:44:53.360]  petitions that have been entered in to have them investigated for their tax-free
[01:44:53.360 --> 01:44:56.960]  exemption they're not supposed to be involved in politics but they brag that
[01:44:56.960 --> 01:45:01.200]  they take their orders from the White House and quote want to criminally in
[01:45:01.200 --> 01:45:06.800]  infiltrate news organizations from within and destroy them so just another
[01:45:06.800 --> 01:45:12.600]  disgusting example of what's going on out there okay let's continue with calls
[01:45:12.600 --> 01:45:18.280]  dustery in Michigan you're on the air go ahead hey thank you Alex I'm bringing
[01:45:18.280 --> 01:45:23.560]  a republic back to Michigan and I'm bringing in a common law system we
[01:45:23.560 --> 01:45:28.560]  dealt to add multi-laws and I'm looking for anybody and everybody in Michigan in
[01:45:28.560 --> 01:45:33.480]  every county who wants to help by bringing in common law courts I've got
[01:45:33.480 --> 01:45:39.000]  Michigan common law dot com and I've got documents up there to get rid of your
[01:45:39.000 --> 01:45:45.920]  artificial person and by doing this it helps cut the funding to Congress because
[01:45:45.920 --> 01:45:50.560]  you no longer is susceptible to their laws you know I've seen a lot of this out
[01:45:50.560 --> 01:45:55.280]  there and I'm not I haven't looked at your information but a lot of it you know
[01:45:55.280 --> 01:46:00.000]  is really patriot mythology and because the system's totally criminal I mean
[01:46:00.000 --> 01:46:04.480]  they don't care if it's illegal the TSA to grab your genitals they do it they
[01:46:04.480 --> 01:46:07.000]  don't care if it's illegal for the president to launch a war in Libya they
[01:46:07.000 --> 01:46:10.960]  do it they don't care if it's illegal for the CIA to ship in cocaine to the US
[01:46:10.960 --> 01:46:15.280]  just got caught running major drug cartel El Paso times federal court
[01:46:15.280 --> 01:46:20.520]  documents they just do it and I and I've seen people that break away stop paying
[01:46:20.520 --> 01:46:24.660]  all the taxes and a lot of times you just get left alone because the
[01:46:24.660 --> 01:46:28.760]  government's all bluff just like the illegal aliens you know I mean just say
[01:46:28.760 --> 01:46:32.560]  change your name do an illegal aliens name and suddenly the cops will leave you
[01:46:32.560 --> 01:46:37.280]  alone you'll be God no driver's license needed no taxes if you do get arrested
[01:46:37.280 --> 01:46:41.080]  they just say you don't speak English they let you go so I think some people
[01:46:41.080 --> 01:46:46.760]  have success with some of this patriot stuff and then and then kind of get left
[01:46:46.760 --> 01:46:52.160]  alone because the system counts on us to comply with all their garbage and it is
[01:46:52.160 --> 01:46:55.720]  admiralty I've read that in federal court rulings they are taking property
[01:46:55.720 --> 01:47:00.240]  without due process the courts are taking it criminally the banks are doing
[01:47:00.240 --> 01:47:05.600]  it so I'm not saying you individually and I appreciate your call are wrong I
[01:47:05.600 --> 01:47:11.600]  just I've been doing this 16 years and I've been really awake for 18 and I've
[01:47:11.600 --> 01:47:18.840]  been through it a lot and I see a lot of people you know foul liens on the police
[01:47:18.840 --> 01:47:24.080]  or whatever and it just ends up getting you sent to prison now as for common law
[01:47:24.080 --> 01:47:28.440]  courts our juries are supposed to be common law courts our grand juries are
[01:47:28.440 --> 01:47:32.960]  supposed to wear the pants and not be bossed around by the prosecutor juries
[01:47:32.960 --> 01:47:35.320]  are not supposed to be boss around by the judge they're supposed to instruct
[01:47:35.320 --> 01:47:40.240]  the judge and ask questions so again it's all a culture of caloring the
[01:47:40.240 --> 01:47:44.640]  government that has to end it's very complex so I don't get into those areas
[01:47:44.640 --> 01:47:49.920]  a lot because in fact I know there's remedies to the mortgage fraud but I
[01:47:49.920 --> 01:47:53.000]  pretty much don't even have guests on about that because how can you a hundred
[01:47:53.000 --> 01:47:56.320]  percent know they're gonna do help people properly you know what I mean it's
[01:47:56.320 --> 01:48:01.080]  just I don't like I don't even like giving financial advice so I say what I
[01:48:01.080 --> 01:48:05.000]  would do financially you know I mean it's just really sticky stuff I appreciate
[01:48:05.000 --> 01:48:08.440]  your call Sheldon in Wisconsin you're on the year go ahead
[01:48:08.440 --> 01:48:13.880]  hey good afternoon Alex Howard good welcome all right I woke it up to you
[01:48:13.880 --> 01:48:17.920]  about three years ago so I'm proud to say you my brother he would do on my black man
[01:48:17.920 --> 01:48:22.120]  from Milwaukee Wisconsin thanks for the soft talk today well God bless you as
[01:48:22.120 --> 01:48:29.320]  well sir but please continue no no I have three quick points to me why the
[01:48:29.320 --> 01:48:34.360]  public is intrigued with the death telling that that's that's treasonous
[01:48:34.360 --> 01:48:40.960]  why don't we talk about can you enlighten the public on something that we
[01:48:40.960 --> 01:48:44.240]  should be in teaching the president over like the murder of Donald Young or
[01:48:44.240 --> 01:48:48.880]  his brother certificate or why is he using a social security number from a
[01:48:48.880 --> 01:48:54.040]  white guy a hundred some years old from Connecticut that's my first point and
[01:48:54.040 --> 01:48:59.680]  I'm a GCN listener I listen to your your your co-worker Dr. Beagle who speaks
[01:48:59.680 --> 01:49:04.160]  very highly of you and Ron Paul I'd like to see him on your show but he had a
[01:49:04.160 --> 01:49:08.480]  subject on referring to some of that fascination which is used to take the
[01:49:08.480 --> 01:49:13.080]  God gene out of a human being I don't know if you ever heard of that or well I know
[01:49:13.080 --> 01:49:16.720]  governments admit they're trying to develop drugs that quote target the
[01:49:16.720 --> 01:49:20.720]  spirit part of the brain you know that the part that is associated with
[01:49:20.720 --> 01:49:25.520]  lighting up under CAT scans during spiritual experiences I know that they're
[01:49:25.520 --> 01:49:28.880]  coming over the whole class of vaccines that aren't really vaccines they're
[01:49:28.880 --> 01:49:35.360]  mutagenic biosystems that actually rewrite tissues in the body including
[01:49:35.360 --> 01:49:39.960]  brain tissue a lot of those are the things that quote will cure cocaine or
[01:49:39.960 --> 01:49:45.560]  alcohol you know addiction because they actually go and change the brain and so
[01:49:45.560 --> 01:49:51.520]  think of the mind control and cultural takeover aspects of that but no
[01:49:51.520 --> 01:49:54.880]  specifically what's the name of this vaccine
[01:49:54.880 --> 01:50:02.800]  fun back f you and VAX did you say Flynn back no fun if you guys are having fun
[01:50:02.800 --> 01:50:09.040]  okay got it fun back right in the White House just released a report maybe like
[01:50:09.040 --> 01:50:13.240]  two or three weeks ago I don't know if you heard about the Deagle of course I
[01:50:13.240 --> 01:50:18.840]  asked but yes he's man he's a great guy he speaks very highly of you and Ron
[01:50:18.840 --> 01:50:23.880]  Paul so I would like to see him on the show what they just a suggestion and my
[01:50:23.880 --> 01:50:28.600]  last point is I want to touch the gangster part of mentality sure I've
[01:50:28.600 --> 01:50:35.000]  been listed to your show for quite some time and I have to admit that I fell
[01:50:35.000 --> 01:50:38.520]  in love with your show I try to get my friends to listen to your show some
[01:50:38.520 --> 01:50:43.760]  are born some are not so my question is to you how do I get the black people out
[01:50:43.760 --> 01:50:48.960]  of the democratic state of mind to vote for Ron Paul they want to they send it
[01:50:48.960 --> 01:50:52.680]  there's no challenge it's a president Bush they have Romney and Perry who are
[01:50:52.680 --> 01:50:57.600]  legal immigrants I believe those guys are Mexican especially Romney you was um

[01:54:14.960 --> 01:54:17.720]  have time to go back to the last caller cuz I've just got to get to some of these
[01:54:17.720 --> 01:54:23.480]  other people in fact who's up next here John all right I want to get to Mike
[01:54:23.480 --> 01:54:29.280]  Mark Pauline Allen at least before Bob Chapman joins us and then Dr. Roberts
[01:54:29.280 --> 01:54:32.560]  again to the economy in the last 30 minutes with both gentlemen riding
[01:54:32.560 --> 01:54:36.440]  shotgun with us but to answer the last caller's question I guess it was
[01:54:36.440 --> 01:54:42.040]  Sheldon in Wisconsin he was bringing up you know gang stuff people fighting you
[01:54:42.040 --> 01:54:49.200]  and racial gangs and he was also asking how do you reach out to black folks you
[01:54:49.200 --> 01:54:52.800]  know what I don't worry about it I don't try to target young people or black
[01:54:52.800 --> 01:54:57.160]  people or old people or rich people or poor people I just cover the facts and
[01:54:57.160 --> 01:55:00.960]  that's the way it is and I don't care what people think about me and I never
[01:55:00.960 --> 01:55:11.960]  did that to just be confident and I never did that to try to garner support
[01:55:11.960 --> 01:55:16.360]  but I found that it actually did have that effect so you've just got to be
[01:55:16.360 --> 01:55:20.000]  confident but a lot of people don't see themselves as leaders they don't see
[01:55:20.000 --> 01:55:24.360]  themselves as being involved in society they just are kind of passive and go
[01:55:24.360 --> 01:55:27.400]  work and get a paycheck and then think about what they want to do that's fun
[01:55:27.400 --> 01:55:30.600]  and what TV shows they want to watch they don't see themselves as part of the
[01:55:30.600 --> 01:55:35.640]  world but mainly just folks that dress up I mean that's what all this fronting is
[01:55:35.640 --> 01:55:40.940]  about the yuppies do it everybody does it with their bling I mean if I wanted a
[01:55:40.940 --> 01:55:45.480]  fancy car would be because it drove fast and was reliable but then I wouldn't
[01:55:45.480 --> 01:55:50.640]  have a really fancy car because I don't want folks looking at it and wanting it
[01:55:50.640 --> 01:55:54.880]  and I don't want to make people feel bad you know what I mean like I don't want
[01:55:54.880 --> 01:56:01.800]  bling but other people they do want bling and I and you know that's across
[01:56:01.800 --> 01:56:06.400]  the board just because it's about the bling it's not about the person I mean
[01:56:06.400 --> 01:56:13.180]  I'm just marveling yesterday ants got in my car somehow I went up the car right
[01:56:13.180 --> 01:56:17.120]  at sunset there were ants and I just thought they were so neat little bitty
[01:56:17.120 --> 01:56:21.160]  sugar ants of some type never seen with long antennas running around in my car
[01:56:21.160 --> 01:56:25.360]  they were just so cool I mean I'm not into diamond necklaces and stuff I'm
[01:56:25.360 --> 01:56:32.320]  sorry I mean I and this in the moon you know was up and I was looking at it and
[01:56:32.320 --> 01:56:35.480]  it was just even though it was like a hundred and eight degrees outside I was
[01:56:35.480 --> 01:56:41.720]  like this is really cool like the earth is burning up Al Gore's right I mean
[01:56:41.720 --> 01:56:45.480]  there's just so much interesting stuff everything's interesting I've had a
[01:56:45.480 --> 01:56:48.600]  migraine headache before and it was so painful I'm like this is actually kind
[01:56:48.600 --> 01:56:54.680]  of interesting but I guess I'm crazy you know I'm different let's go ahead and
[01:56:54.680 --> 01:56:59.680]  let's talk to Mike in Illinois Mike you're on the air welcome
[01:56:59.680 --> 01:57:03.520]  you know I've been wanting to tell you about this forever there are myriad of
[01:57:03.520 --> 01:57:10.280]  things I could talk to you about but you know in two books in two passages in
[01:57:10.280 --> 01:57:15.640]  the Bible book in Joshua and second Samuel they talk about Jasher and
[01:57:15.640 --> 01:57:25.680]  Jasher talks about half men half bears and it's a Jasher 32 the Bible is full
[01:57:25.680 --> 01:57:33.400]  of Chimeras and big floating spaceships and guys with blue helmets on making
[01:57:33.400 --> 01:57:36.600]  them take things that make them hallucinate and splicing men with
[01:57:36.600 --> 01:57:42.640]  animals the entire Old Testament has got more more green men running around in
[01:57:42.640 --> 01:57:47.920]  it than coast-to-coast AM 501 see three churches will never tell you about it
[01:57:47.920 --> 01:57:52.600]  that's why we have to infiltrate it the real Christians well look I just don't
[01:57:52.600 --> 01:57:57.680]  even go there because because I mean I can't get people to understand the Sun
[01:57:57.680 --> 01:58:00.560]  is what mainly heats the earth I mean they think that's a conspiracy theory
[01:58:00.560 --> 01:58:04.440]  well it was a majority now the majority know it it's true and I know it's
[01:58:04.440 --> 01:58:08.120]  extreme the Sun eats the earth but so I mean you're trying to get into the fact
[01:58:08.120 --> 01:58:12.960]  that this is a Jewish history of what they really believe was going on and it
[01:58:12.960 --> 01:58:18.400]  sounds like it sounds like War of the Worlds or something I mean if folks
[01:58:18.400 --> 01:58:22.560]  hadn't read Ezekiel and all that stuff it's definitely like a Kurt Vonnegut
[01:58:22.560 --> 01:58:30.480]  science fiction book and time is now absolutely Mike you're awesome hey send
[01:58:30.480 --> 01:58:35.120]  me some more of those passages from the Bible alright ladies and gentlemen we'll

[01:59:05.040 --> 01:59:09.560]  turned a tremendous influence on our president in Congress and they really
[01:59:09.560 --> 01:59:14.360]  are calling the shots I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American

[02:01:16.200 --> 02:01:20.400]  about to announce it for beta testing for folks that want to come sign up and
[02:01:20.400 --> 02:01:24.040]  then they can beta test it and I'm always busy keeping the other sites up but
[02:01:24.040 --> 02:01:31.280]  yes it's coming soon. Yes and I was wondering if you when you get time if
[02:01:31.280 --> 02:01:38.120]  you can now or later any day give just a brief description of what your purposes
[02:01:38.120 --> 02:01:43.320]  and objectives are of launching the social network as well as the nightly
[02:01:43.320 --> 02:01:48.600]  news show I think the social networking has great potential in itself to
[02:01:48.600 --> 02:01:54.880]  actually organize people to become visible to the mass media news as it's
[02:01:54.880 --> 02:02:00.200]  referred to the lesser news and rather break into it you know my bailiwick has
[02:02:00.200 --> 02:02:04.280]  always been publicity when it comes to solutions and I see it as a great
[02:02:04.280 --> 02:02:08.760]  publicity vehicle as well as the organization of people to actually get
[02:02:08.760 --> 02:02:15.880]  together and get out into the street for causes of liberty. Well I agree with
[02:02:15.880 --> 02:02:20.520]  you and the problem is we built two different social networks one we
[02:02:20.520 --> 02:02:25.640]  launched and then it got all screwed up because some you know members were on it
[02:02:25.640 --> 02:02:29.240]  and it just didn't work well we did another one and then it didn't do well
[02:02:29.240 --> 02:02:35.120]  under load testing the problem is it's gonna be big and so I'm always having
[02:02:35.120 --> 02:02:38.600]  limited personnel and always trying to finish things and then once something
[02:02:38.600 --> 02:02:43.040]  gets behind it gets behind forever but I tell you what after the break go as we
[02:02:43.040 --> 02:02:46.120]  go to Bob I'll tell you about my plan briefly for both of those good to hear
[02:02:46.120 --> 02:02:52.480]  from you Mark Paula in Missouri you're on the air welcome. Good afternoon Alex.
[02:02:52.480 --> 02:02:59.960]  I'm a first-time caller and I want to thank you for what you do and I did get
[02:02:59.960 --> 02:03:05.960]  a aqua rain water filter and I've been off fluoride for a year and a half and
[02:03:05.960 --> 02:03:11.560]  most of my arthritis symptoms are gone so I thank you very much. Well that's what
[02:03:11.560 --> 02:03:15.440]  the medical doctors say they say that the fact that the US has record arthritis
[02:03:15.440 --> 02:03:20.440]  one of the biggest contributors is the sodium fluoride in the water because in
[02:03:20.440 --> 02:03:26.000]  all the studies they admit it calcifies out in the joints but the doctors don't
[02:03:26.000 --> 02:03:29.440]  want to tell you that because whether they're not taught that and after
[02:03:29.440 --> 02:03:34.920]  research themselves and they like to make money off of treating the degenerative
[02:03:34.920 --> 02:03:40.400]  condition rather than curing it. And then I had a rheumatologist wanting me to go
[02:03:40.400 --> 02:03:45.760]  to pain management for just OxyContin and I said take my name how you're
[02:03:45.760 --> 02:03:50.960]  data-based I have nothing to do with you. But listen this isn't placebo though
[02:03:50.960 --> 02:03:55.880]  you're saying that your arthritis got a lot better when you got off fluoride.
[02:03:56.560 --> 02:04:03.600]  Yeah I was tickled pink let me tell you but the fibromyalgia that I have is
[02:04:03.600 --> 02:04:11.600]  still a problem but I had emailed some information from a manual that I found
[02:04:11.600 --> 02:04:17.960]  it's a textbook about the US Constitution it was printed in 1887 and
[02:04:17.960 --> 02:04:24.600]  in and in there it says treaties are limited that they cannot I don't have it
[02:04:24.600 --> 02:04:29.040]  in front of me no no man that was always taught and now they just lie and say
[02:04:29.040 --> 02:04:33.280]  treaties supersede the Constitution and the president can launch wars without
[02:04:33.280 --> 02:04:37.200]  congressional approval and we can have a super congress run things and the TSA
[02:04:37.200 --> 02:04:41.580]  can stick their hands down your pants but listen send that to me again send it
[02:04:41.580 --> 02:04:46.120]  to showtipsandinfowars.com because you know I've actually read that a lot of
[02:04:46.120 --> 02:04:50.000]  places in historical documents and and textbooks on the Constitution I've
[02:04:50.000 --> 02:04:52.880]  been sent a lot of them over the years and that's another issue we should point
[02:04:52.880 --> 02:04:58.880]  out again they brazenly lie to you from a fake authoritative position they say
[02:04:58.880 --> 02:05:03.720]  this is the way it is the Sun doesn't heat the earth. Hi folks this is Alex Jones

[02:06:03.880 --> 02:06:08.240]  solar power generator number one new climate legislation could easily double

[02:06:16.440 --> 02:06:20.320]  government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is
[02:06:20.320 --> 02:06:24.440]  coming number three in some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously
[02:06:24.440 --> 02:06:28.760]  overloaded and now new socialist legislation is only compounding the
[02:06:28.760 --> 02:06:33.080]  problem number four dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids every
[02:06:33.080 --> 02:06:36.800]  year thousands of families lose their power from weather-related onages number

[02:08:48.160 --> 02:08:52.520]  a conspiracy biggest private silver and gold broker for decades lived all over
[02:08:52.520 --> 02:08:57.360]  the world always a great expert to have on and I need to cover the waterfront
[02:08:57.360 --> 02:09:02.520]  with him on a basic summation of the debt ceiling the super congress what
[02:09:02.520 --> 02:09:07.960]  we're seeing inside the stock market where gold is going and also some of
[02:09:07.960 --> 02:09:12.480]  your calls interspersed we've got to move quick here also the war news there
[02:09:12.480 --> 02:09:17.320]  is so much here that I want to discuss with our guests but first the last
[02:09:17.320 --> 02:09:23.760]  caller or two callers ago mark in Oregon was asking what is your plan with the
[02:09:23.760 --> 02:09:31.640]  TV show okay just like Glenn Beck has his new subscriber TV show I've had a
[02:09:31.640 --> 02:09:37.440]  subscriber radio TV show for eight years with my films and the books and
[02:09:37.440 --> 02:09:42.840]  everything at prison planet TV want the TV show launches September 1st 7 p.m.
[02:09:42.840 --> 02:09:47.560]  Central 30 minutes long they'll also be at least once a week hour or two hour
[02:09:47.560 --> 02:09:54.320]  long info or special reports and those will be at prison planet TV because
[02:09:54.320 --> 02:09:58.760]  that's what pays for the graphics the video people the camera people the
[02:09:58.760 --> 02:10:03.360]  researchers all of this because I see comments on info wars in prison planet
[02:10:03.360 --> 02:10:08.920]  when we'll post hey we just added Gerald Salante on last night you know to cover
[02:10:08.920 --> 02:10:13.240]  what's happening in the markets and then we had Mike Adams in here about the
[02:10:13.240 --> 02:10:20.560]  raids on people selling papayas and watermelons and raw cheese and then of
[02:10:20.560 --> 02:10:23.960]  course I cover government drug dealing it's like an hour-long special report
[02:10:23.960 --> 02:10:27.760]  and they're like complaining going on this should be free give it to me right
[02:10:27.760 --> 02:10:33.480]  now you scum meanwhile while they were saying that this morning it was free
[02:10:33.480 --> 02:10:38.720]  was free over at the Alex Jones channel at YouTube but but you're right I'm a
[02:10:38.720 --> 02:10:44.160]  bad businessman my goal is to get the word out prison planet TV members you
[02:10:44.160 --> 02:10:47.680]  just underwrite us it's really a donation you get it first you get it live
[02:10:47.680 --> 02:10:51.480]  you get it in higher quality you get it all in one spot and we are just gonna
[02:10:51.480 --> 02:10:56.720]  leave prison planet TV sometime this year next year it's gonna stay there but
[02:10:56.720 --> 02:11:00.800]  we're gonna build a whole new site a whole new platform that's gonna have
[02:11:00.800 --> 02:11:03.640]  even more and you notice we've added a lot to prison planet TV it's a great
[02:11:03.640 --> 02:11:07.080]  site so you'll just get one membership you'll have both it's gonna be a whole
[02:11:07.080 --> 02:11:11.560]  new news system but it doesn't matter I'm not procrastinating I've been
[02:11:11.560 --> 02:11:16.320]  planning this nightly TV show for five years and never doing it because I had
[02:11:16.320 --> 02:11:20.400]  to move over here get bigger spend a year building that studio then you're
[02:11:20.400 --> 02:11:24.440]  busy doing all your other work and so we're burning the midnight oil up here
[02:11:24.440 --> 02:11:30.960]  the guys were here again until midnight last week they were here two nights past
[02:11:30.960 --> 02:11:35.400]  midnight I'm only been standing up here till nine or ten I mean I went on like
[02:11:35.400 --> 02:11:41.720]  6 30 yesterday so the point is we're working hard and now now the info war
[02:11:41.720 --> 02:11:46.680]  special reports you're seeing are even a different studio it those are in a
[02:11:46.680 --> 02:11:51.560]  roundtable format versus the news program you haven't seen that yet right now
[02:11:51.560 --> 02:11:55.080]  you're just seeing special reports and you'll notice we've done three of them
[02:11:55.080 --> 02:11:57.600]  in the last week and a half and they're getting better and better better
[02:11:57.600 --> 02:12:02.280]  graphics better music better information I'm saying I'm very impressed with the
[02:12:02.280 --> 02:12:06.280]  crew and I'd like to be able to give them raises as well so I hope that you'll
[02:12:06.280 --> 02:12:09.200]  go to prison planet dot TV and get a membership you can download any of the
[02:12:09.200 --> 02:12:13.280]  special reports burn the desk and about whoever you want and I know it's evil
[02:12:13.280 --> 02:12:16.920]  that we charge for it so we can finance it we should just I should be like a
[02:12:16.920 --> 02:12:21.920]  wizard with a top hat on and go abracadabra bugumba and then it's like a
[02:12:21.920 --> 02:12:27.200]  cloud city forms with pink dragons flying around and you know and pinkie pie
[02:12:27.200 --> 02:12:33.280]  the winged my little pony could be there too and skittles would fall from the
[02:12:33.280 --> 02:12:40.760]  sky we would eat candy and Care Bears it's just just everything but we have
[02:12:40.760 --> 02:12:45.120]  the online video bookstores the great new info wars camo ball caps in the
[02:12:45.120 --> 02:12:48.680]  liberty or death shirts that are really hot when you purchase when you buy the
[02:12:48.680 --> 02:12:52.480]  books and videos that's what supports this radio broadcast and then we can have
[02:12:52.480 --> 02:12:56.800]  all these other guests on we then get the word out for as well show September
[02:12:56.800 --> 02:13:00.920]  1st 7 p.m. every night 30 minutes show at least and a lot of times it'll then go
[02:13:00.920 --> 02:13:04.640]  into a special report section where we'll just go for another hour or there'll
[02:13:04.640 --> 02:13:08.520]  be whole other special reports I mean we're really up in the game against the
[02:13:08.520 --> 02:13:14.880]  globalist and we are the model we are tomorrow's network a decade ago now
[02:13:14.880 --> 02:13:18.600]  Glenn Beck says tomorrow's network today we are the Glenn Beck network a decade
[02:13:18.600 --> 02:13:23.000]  ago and he understands that's the future and that's great so that's what we're
[02:13:23.000 --> 02:13:26.760]  doing here and we're beating him to the punch and because that's free market you
[02:13:26.760 --> 02:13:31.880]  know we're into winning here in the info war so prison planet TV 15 cents a day
[02:13:31.880 --> 02:13:35.920]  595 a month I get a yearly membership get three months free and we're just
[02:13:35.920 --> 02:13:41.200]  adding more and more and more and more and more okay now going to Bob Chapman
[02:13:41.200 --> 02:13:47.080]  Bob Chapman great to have you here the international forecaster calm so much is
[02:13:47.080 --> 02:13:53.920]  going on a before I forget what do you think of the Super Congress is a new
[02:13:53.920 --> 02:13:59.800]  form of government as many people are saying and be then let's get into the
[02:13:59.800 --> 02:14:06.880]  debt limit and where we're going here well I think it's unconstitutional and
[02:14:06.880 --> 02:14:13.120]  we'll see I'm not a constitutionalist attorney but from what I know and from
[02:14:13.120 --> 02:14:21.280]  what I see that's what I think it is and why would Congress want to sit virtually
[02:14:21.280 --> 02:14:25.960]  mute until they just decide what this these 12 people decide what they're
[02:14:25.960 --> 02:14:31.680]  going to do anybody who voted against the bill is automatically disqualified me
[02:14:31.680 --> 02:14:42.400]  by being one of the 12 and the 12 are going to make legislation and it's sort
[02:14:42.400 --> 02:14:51.080]  of like a star chamber proceeding perhaps or a Soviet bullet burrow and is it
[02:14:51.080 --> 02:14:56.240]  going to spread to other things other than just solving this debt crisis and
[02:14:56.240 --> 02:15:03.280]  and austerity and cutting back on spending or perhaps including tax
[02:15:03.280 --> 02:15:08.240]  increases and we don't know yet and will I get involved in other legislation
[02:15:08.240 --> 02:15:13.520]  probably well Harry Reid says Harry Reid says they will and spending bills
[02:15:13.520 --> 02:15:17.560]  affect everything so the cutting bills but but I've been getting back the end
[02:15:17.560 --> 02:15:21.080]  of the filibuster in the Senate the end of amendments I mean the bills are
[02:15:21.080 --> 02:15:24.800]  supposed to come from individual members of the House this is completely
[02:15:24.800 --> 02:15:28.720]  backwards a 12 member committee with the president is the 13th and you pointed
[02:15:28.720 --> 02:15:32.080]  out a point that I saw in the news and never even covered it's worse than I
[02:15:32.080 --> 02:15:37.200]  said that's right they in Reuters they reported that they have told also
[02:15:37.200 --> 02:15:40.920]  Politico that if you voted against this now you can't be part of the super
[02:15:40.920 --> 02:15:45.400]  committee or even discuss things with the committee so they're now saying that
[02:15:45.400 --> 02:15:50.600]  you're elected by your district and your district that elected you has no say
[02:15:50.600 --> 02:15:56.760]  this is a new form of government and of course it's absolutely unconstitutional
[02:15:56.760 --> 02:16:02.840]  I mean I mean the Constitution says that the bills start in the House spending
[02:16:02.840 --> 02:16:07.880]  bills especially they don't start in some star chamber Bob as you know that's
[02:16:07.880 --> 02:16:14.400]  right and so I think this is a move toward a venture eventual dictatorial
[02:16:14.400 --> 02:16:20.920]  government as well down the road giving the president a great power in working
[02:16:20.920 --> 02:16:26.840]  with these 12 individuals who were appointed and as far as what they're
[02:16:26.840 --> 02:16:35.840]  gonna do in relation to cuts in the cost of government remains to be seen as we
[02:16:35.840 --> 02:16:42.480]  discussed before the setting up of this committee was one of the three things
[02:16:42.480 --> 02:16:48.360]  they wanted to do behind the scenes so to speak until it became known and the
[02:16:48.360 --> 02:16:53.600]  other was to cut Social Security and Medicare and whatever way that they
[02:16:53.600 --> 02:17:00.560]  could so that they could get what they want done and channel the money into the
[02:17:00.560 --> 02:17:05.120]  areas that they want to challenge to I mean if you cut back in Social Security
[02:17:05.120 --> 02:17:12.320]  and in Medicare and let's say it's a million dollars and is half of the
[02:17:12.320 --> 02:17:22.360]  savings going to go to enlarge the the military industrial complex or is it
[02:17:22.360 --> 02:17:30.160]  going to be used to not cut military industrial complex back as much as you
[02:17:30.160 --> 02:17:36.160]  would have had to or is it going for other pet projects there's a whole
[02:17:36.160 --> 02:17:45.680]  string of things that they can do and they go to a wild well you're right Bob
[02:17:45.680 --> 02:17:52.640]  and and looking at this seeing what's happened in the economy as Ron Paul has
[02:17:52.640 --> 02:17:56.680]  said as you've said Dr. Roberts has said as the chai comm said I hate agreeing
[02:17:56.680 --> 02:18:00.320]  with them we're already defaulted debating whether it goes up or down
[02:18:00.320 --> 02:18:04.720]  we're dead if we up the debt limit we're dead if we don't because we're not
[02:18:04.720 --> 02:18:10.160]  debating the the the thousand plus trillion and derivatives that we've been
[02:18:10.160 --> 02:18:15.400]  signed on to so why did the stock market why is it going crazy the last 48
[02:18:15.400 --> 02:18:21.600]  hours a and b is the plunge protection team involved well first of all they're
[02:18:21.600 --> 02:18:28.240]  not involved in the long side or haven't been up until perhaps an hour ago they
[02:18:28.240 --> 02:18:31.520]  let the market go down they could have stopped it they have the power to do
[02:18:31.520 --> 02:18:35.800]  that and so they wanted the market down we'll find out find out a little bit
[02:18:35.800 --> 02:18:43.760]  later why if you notice the patent the market went down it continued this
[02:18:43.760 --> 02:18:48.600]  warning down a couple hundred more points now it's up 90 points they continue
[02:18:48.600 --> 02:18:53.400]  to attack silver and gold particularly silver which is a much thinner market a
[02:18:53.400 --> 02:18:58.680]  why because JPM and HSBC are short silver and they were getting their
[02:18:58.680 --> 02:19:03.860]  heads handed to them again more manipulation by government or the
[02:19:03.860 --> 02:19:09.000]  people who control government in the Fed which is JPM GS city group etc and
[02:19:09.000 --> 02:19:16.080]  so they really took the the commodities apart yesterday too and they've got
[02:19:16.080 --> 02:19:26.840]  they had oil down to around $85 and that doesn't normally happen if oil moves
[02:19:26.840 --> 02:19:31.760]  it usually you lose a dollar or two or less and so they were in the markets
[02:19:31.760 --> 02:19:38.980]  big time they let the Dow go down but they attacked commodities and gold
[02:19:38.980 --> 02:19:42.200]  and silver and now they're back and they're trying to hold it up at least
[02:19:42.200 --> 02:19:46.680]  temporarily ah so an attack on gold and silver well if it was it didn't work
[02:19:46.680 --> 02:19:52.040]  long but knocked it down like 15 bucks and it's almost retraced its gains right
[02:19:52.040 --> 02:19:56.320]  there in the doldrums of summer now I want to look at how they're trying to
[02:19:56.320 --> 02:19:59.320]  blame the Tea Party for this and what the Super Congress will do when we come
[02:19:59.320 --> 02:20:04.920]  back with Bob Chapman question can functional magnetic resonance imaging

[02:24:15.320 --> 02:24:20.560]  the rest of the full official broadcast and I forgot during the break to ask Bob
[02:24:20.560 --> 02:24:23.880]  Chapman if he wants to stay 30 minutes into the next hour so we can get into
[02:24:23.880 --> 02:24:27.920]  more financial news which will be present planet dot TV and info wars dot
[02:24:27.920 --> 02:24:33.040]  com audio streams only we'll just ask Bob now as I forgot Bob you saddled up to
[02:24:33.040 --> 02:24:38.200]  go 30 minutes the next hour or you have prior agreements no no I always leave
[02:24:38.200 --> 02:24:43.760]  time open for that and I told you guys in there when we were on the break that
[02:24:43.760 --> 02:24:47.360]  yes I will be here okay good see I even forget what I asked you in the break I
[02:24:47.360 --> 02:24:51.600]  was just gonna ask you I guess they heard me mumbling and I did ask good now
[02:24:51.600 --> 02:25:00.000]  now Bob look we've seen this we we see them rebranding now that that the
[02:25:00.000 --> 02:25:06.160]  terror threat is mainly anti-globalist white people or folks that don't like the
[02:25:06.160 --> 02:25:09.960]  Federal Reserve gang raping them and then now we saw the vice president this
[02:25:09.960 --> 02:25:13.560]  week and a whole bunch of others in the New York Times and politico say yes the
[02:25:13.560 --> 02:25:17.480]  Tea Party really are terrorist and they got terrorist tactics and they're gonna
[02:25:17.480 --> 02:25:22.560]  blow stuff up and we had the White House memos and advisors let me remember a
[02:25:22.560 --> 02:25:26.200]  year ago publicly saying a terror attack would sure help you Mr. President
[02:25:26.200 --> 02:25:35.080]  and we've got the very suspicious situation over in Norway all of that
[02:25:35.080 --> 02:25:39.800]  and then I heard oh you've got to go ahead and let us raise your taxes on the
[02:25:39.800 --> 02:25:43.560]  debt limit you know the Tea Party's holding this up for no reason when it
[02:25:43.560 --> 02:25:47.720]  was really all about taxes and then now I heard it yesterday and today it's all
[02:25:47.720 --> 02:25:51.680]  over the news well the the market crashed because the Tea Party didn't
[02:25:51.680 --> 02:25:56.640]  let spending go up enough when spending does go way up and oh my gosh the Tea
[02:25:56.640 --> 02:26:01.200]  Party causes so I see them putting the star chamber in place the committee of
[02:26:01.200 --> 02:26:06.600]  13 getting them in place there and then as things get really bad as you and
[02:26:06.600 --> 02:26:10.200]  others are predicted in the fall that's right when their power will be in full
[02:26:10.200 --> 02:26:15.520]  swing and now they're in control of new banker bailouts new stimuluses new
[02:26:15.520 --> 02:26:24.240]  systems I think we're we're gonna be in for absolute highway robbery come the
[02:26:24.240 --> 02:26:28.680]  fall they're lining up new wars I think we're gonna see this super
[02:26:28.680 --> 02:26:33.520]  congress really power grab in the fall and blame kind of like they blame smooth
[02:26:33.520 --> 02:26:37.600]  hauling for putting tariffs in after the damage had already been done and we
[02:26:37.600 --> 02:26:41.040]  were imploding they put them in after the crash already began and then they
[02:26:41.040 --> 02:26:47.520]  blame them for it Bob break that down that's a good take on that and it's
[02:26:47.520 --> 02:26:55.000]  something that has always disturbed me and that was offset not too long ago by
[02:26:55.000 --> 02:27:02.920]  Mr. Bernanke who admitted that the depression was caused by the lack of
[02:27:02.920 --> 02:27:07.480]  money and credit in the economy and they just froze everything up and brought it
[02:27:07.480 --> 02:27:14.600]  on and they've admitted that and that was the cause not smooth hardly not
[02:27:14.600 --> 02:27:20.120]  tariffs and even the tariffs that they put on were really minuscule and then
[02:27:20.120 --> 02:27:24.880]  everybody else put their tariffs on so it was like a terrorist a tariff banquet
[02:27:24.880 --> 02:27:30.520]  and if you put 4% on this well the country down the way put 4% on this
[02:27:30.520 --> 02:27:37.240]  also and so much of it neutralized each other and so you're absolutely right
[02:27:37.240 --> 02:27:43.440]  another instance of blaming something on something else that had very little
[02:27:43.440 --> 02:27:51.240]  if nothing to do with what happened and the control that they have of the media
[02:27:51.240 --> 02:27:59.320]  is really astounding everything they want brought on in great amounts and you
[02:27:59.320 --> 02:28:05.560]  were referring to the Tea Party group or movement and that's what they were doing
[02:28:05.560 --> 02:28:11.040]  they have to have somebody to blame for what they were doing and so we have to
[02:28:11.040 --> 02:28:16.880]  counter that by telling the people no that isn't the way it happened this is
[02:28:16.880 --> 02:28:21.320]  the way it happened they wanted to do it's exactly it's not the Federal
[02:28:21.320 --> 02:28:25.660]  Reserve that did this it's not the 27 trillion and banker bailouts that did
[02:28:25.660 --> 02:28:36.840]  all of this it's not globalism or the derivatives or or or any of it no it's
[02:28:36.840 --> 02:28:42.680]  now all of us who want to not increase taxes and want to cut spending and want
[02:28:42.680 --> 02:28:49.720]  to get our house back in order it's all our fault Bob we did all this from the
[02:28:49.720 --> 02:28:54.600]  point of view you're absolutely right and they will continue to do that and we
[02:28:54.600 --> 02:28:58.880]  have to fight fire with fire truth with truth and that's what we're going to do
[02:28:58.880 --> 02:29:04.680]  and believe me we're getting heard all over the world I did five foreign
[02:29:04.680 --> 02:29:09.440]  interviews in the last six or seven days and I don't call them they call me or
[02:29:09.440 --> 02:29:18.080]  they email me and so there's a great thirst for the truth all over the world
[02:29:18.080 --> 02:29:24.920]  everywhere and I think it's wonderful and you in particular and others are
[02:29:24.920 --> 02:29:29.560]  supplying the truth that these people need to understand what their problems
[02:29:29.560 --> 02:29:34.040]  are well it's asinine that the establishment media has been wrong on
[02:29:34.040 --> 02:29:37.960]  everything not because they're dumb because they're misleading people we've
[02:29:37.960 --> 02:29:43.440]  been incredibly accurate and then they turn around and try to blame those of us
[02:29:43.440 --> 02:29:47.240]  who are actually addressing the real problem but that's classic just like
[02:29:47.240 --> 02:29:50.360]  they're gonna stage terror attacks and blame it on us as well and this is what's
[02:29:50.360 --> 02:29:56.160]  coming we'll be right back we're on the March the Empire's on the run Alex Jones

[02:35:41.200 --> 02:35:45.320]  Wall Street Journal former head of policy department of Treasury under Reagan
[02:35:45.320 --> 02:35:50.800]  the father of Reaganomics who has laid out the fact that we've offshored our
[02:35:50.800 --> 02:35:55.360]  economy and so nothing is going to fix it and until that's discussed we have no
[02:35:55.360 --> 02:35:58.560]  hope and talked about of course the debt ceiling being a discussion over
[02:35:58.560 --> 02:36:02.160]  rearranging deck chairs and the Titanic and we're gonna get into that with him
[02:36:02.160 --> 02:36:05.120]  and what's happened in the markets and get Bob Chapman's taken and Bob asked
[02:36:05.120 --> 02:36:07.640]  some questions or have these two gentlemen converse I think it's
[02:36:07.640 --> 02:36:12.360]  interesting to have the two together but first this been this this been a lot in
[02:36:12.360 --> 02:36:18.320]  development in New Yorker magazine very very interesting and then we'll dovetail
[02:36:18.320 --> 02:36:22.800]  that with Russian envoy NATO is planning attacks on Syria and Iran next
[02:36:22.800 --> 02:36:26.960]  we'll get Dr. Paul Craig Roberts take on that doc good to have you here with us
[02:36:26.960 --> 02:36:33.240]  thanks Alex so let's get into your latest column it's very interesting well
[02:36:33.240 --> 02:36:37.920]  Alex you you know the New Yorker published this story that was planted I
[02:36:37.920 --> 02:36:44.960]  think on the journalist by sources who claim to know about the killing of
[02:36:44.960 --> 02:36:51.720]  bin Laden and it's obviously a fairytale I think it had a purpose which was to
[02:36:51.720 --> 02:36:58.400]  sort of explain why the seals killed bin Laden instead of capturing him and the
[02:36:58.400 --> 02:37:05.040]  explanation given was that the US government didn't want any detainees and
[02:37:05.040 --> 02:37:11.240]  and then it was to give an explanation of why they dumped his body in the ocean
[02:37:11.240 --> 02:37:16.040]  instead of producing the evidence and the answer was well that's the way the
[02:37:16.040 --> 02:37:22.120]  seals have have disposed of other victims and it was just what they did but
[02:37:22.120 --> 02:37:27.760]  before they did it they called up some Saudi intelligent officials somewhere
[02:37:27.760 --> 02:37:37.840]  and got his approval so obviously it's it's just some sort of a repeat of the
[02:37:37.840 --> 02:37:43.680]  story that we were told earlier after they finally changed it a dozen times
[02:37:43.680 --> 02:37:49.040]  and put it together and the question that I raised was why didn't the New
[02:37:49.040 --> 02:37:55.720]  Yorker send somebody to interview the Pakistani who watched the whole thing
[02:37:55.720 --> 02:38:00.880]  from the roof of his house next door to the alleged compound of bin Laden and
[02:38:00.880 --> 02:38:07.080]  who was interviewed on Pakistani television and I watched the interview
[02:38:07.080 --> 02:38:12.120]  but I couldn't understand the language but someone had put an English
[02:38:12.120 --> 02:38:17.960]  translation running along the bottom of the video and in in a script and what
[02:38:17.960 --> 02:38:23.240]  he was saying was that well there were three helicopters one landed about a
[02:38:23.240 --> 02:38:27.600]  dozen people got out went in the house a few minutes later they came back got in
[02:38:27.600 --> 02:38:32.120]  the helicopter and it lifted off it blew up and they were all killed and I saw
[02:38:32.120 --> 02:38:36.800]  the bodies all over the place and and pieces of bodies and then we went down
[02:38:36.800 --> 02:38:43.520]  and the Pakistani military came and shoot us off well the US government
[02:38:43.520 --> 02:38:48.600]  acknowledges it lost a helicopter but they claims nobody was injured somehow
[02:38:48.600 --> 02:38:55.200]  and crash by the way to back you up they have had major Arabic speaking news
[02:38:55.200 --> 02:38:59.040]  outfits have translated that and that is true and other witnesses said there was
[02:38:59.040 --> 02:39:02.840]  a guy that lived there for years and he looked like bin Laden but it wasn't bin
[02:39:02.840 --> 02:39:06.320]  Laden they've never produced the wives they say they grabbed there wasn't the
[02:39:06.320 --> 02:39:11.280]  shootout the human shield there wasn't you know the Islamic law burial at sea
[02:39:11.280 --> 02:39:16.200]  it's all just a red you know the fake situation room photos that we said were
[02:39:16.200 --> 02:39:22.040]  fake now admitted to be fake I mean it's just absolutely asinine that this is
[02:39:22.040 --> 02:39:27.240]  going to start it all over again and it's now in the New Yorker you know I
[02:39:27.240 --> 02:39:33.240]  wish somebody would translate to this this broadcast of the interview with
[02:39:33.240 --> 02:39:38.840]  Bashir because it's freely available on YouTube and there must be somebody who
[02:39:38.840 --> 02:39:45.600]  knows the language that can confirm what he's actually saying now if he's
[02:39:45.600 --> 02:39:50.120]  saying what I read on the trans if in other words the English translation I
[02:39:50.120 --> 02:39:55.480]  saw it wasn't a hoax then we have a totally different story from what the
[02:39:55.480 --> 02:39:59.880]  government has told us and you would think that the intelligence committees
[02:39:59.880 --> 02:40:05.040]  with Congress would be interested that somebody in the media would be
[02:40:05.040 --> 02:40:11.160]  interested even in New Yorker because they well from time to time saw hers I
[02:40:11.160 --> 02:40:14.160]  mean he could go over there and interview the guy and find out what
[02:40:14.160 --> 02:40:19.240]  happened and then we could have maybe a bit of truth get out instead of all
[02:40:19.240 --> 02:40:22.520]  these fairy tales well I think what I'm getting from this is you've had respect
[02:40:22.520 --> 02:40:26.800]  from the New Yorker in the past and they have broken a lot of big things I
[02:40:26.800 --> 02:40:30.640]  heard she did break that Nick Cheney wanted to attack our own ships what
[02:40:30.640 --> 02:40:34.600]  five years ago and blame it on the Iranians with fake patrol boats he
[02:40:34.600 --> 02:40:39.120]  exposed Operation Phoenix and the torture in Vietnam but let me tell you
[02:40:39.120 --> 02:40:44.120]  this is for Obama though and we know they're big Democrats over there so they
[02:40:44.120 --> 02:40:47.880]  they seemed to only break stuff on Republicans very partisan outfits so Dr.
[02:40:47.880 --> 02:40:52.240]  Roberts I would advise that you not hold your breath because you know we need
[02:40:52.240 --> 02:40:56.240]  you I don't I don't think you're gonna get that out of them no I won't hold my
[02:40:56.240 --> 02:41:03.640]  breath somebody could very easily translate the language interview and put
[02:41:03.640 --> 02:41:08.680]  it up so that we would have it let me briefly get Bob Chapman's take on this
[02:41:08.680 --> 02:41:12.400]  and instead of Alex Jones asking a question about the economy I'll have
[02:41:12.400 --> 02:41:16.280]  Bob throwing at you and you guys can go back and forth Bob Chapman of the
[02:41:16.280 --> 02:41:20.800]  International Forecaster Bob you got any comments on the whole Osama bin Laden
[02:41:20.800 --> 02:41:30.880]  rabbit trick I think it's a rewrite just like Mr. Roberts said and I think they
[02:41:30.880 --> 02:41:35.720]  continue to try to redo the mistakes that they've made they made a terrible
[02:41:35.720 --> 02:41:42.880]  mess of it especially for someone who's been deceased for some time and they
[02:41:42.880 --> 02:41:52.680]  just made a mess of it again as far as the economy is concerned I would like
[02:41:52.680 --> 02:42:03.640]  to get to take Mr. Roberts on has QE3 started or when do you think it will I
[02:42:03.640 --> 02:42:09.280]  have my ideas and what do you think well you know Bob they they might start at
[02:42:09.280 --> 02:42:15.560]  this time without telling us but I don't think they already did well notice he
[02:42:15.560 --> 02:42:18.960]  said months ago he wouldn't do it and now they say well we may have to but
[02:42:18.960 --> 02:42:25.000]  there's every indicator they're still monetizing debt aren't they well I
[02:42:25.000 --> 02:42:34.920]  don't know you know right now what we do know is they used up yesterday 60% of
[02:42:34.920 --> 02:42:43.160]  their new debt ceiling increase so I think the problem that the government
[02:42:43.160 --> 02:42:49.000]  faces is it's got more crises than it's aware of and it's thinking that it just
[02:42:49.000 --> 02:42:56.640]  has some sort of a deep recession but it's they're thinking in the normal
[02:42:56.640 --> 02:43:01.080]  terms of a post-war recession where workers are laid off from jobs that
[02:43:01.080 --> 02:43:07.560]  still exist and could be called back to work if the government can pump up
[02:43:07.560 --> 02:43:12.560]  demand enough can create enough new aggregate demand yet they're still
[02:43:12.560 --> 02:43:17.960]  thinking in that model you see it for example in Paul Krugman who says that
[02:43:17.960 --> 02:43:22.880]  we could recover if the government would just run a bigger deficit and then they
[02:43:22.880 --> 02:43:28.760]  have another problem on top of that that they do recognize and that is that
[02:43:28.760 --> 02:43:35.800]  they've got an ongoing financial crisis no one really knows this true state of
[02:43:35.800 --> 02:43:43.840]  the banks and and whether they're solvent or or not and but what they
[02:43:43.840 --> 02:43:50.280]  don't understand is they have let offshoring destroy the economy and
[02:43:50.280 --> 02:43:55.560]  there are no jobs to call people back to work to well isn't this the banksters
[02:43:55.560 --> 02:44:00.200]  thinking that their fiat paper derivative economy is a real economy I
[02:44:00.200 --> 02:44:03.520]  mean at the end of the day you can't eat that paper and you just mentioned it
[02:44:03.520 --> 02:44:08.280]  here's French news agency two days ago explain this to me US borrowing tops
[02:44:08.280 --> 02:44:16.720]  100% of GDP the day they lifted it US debt shot up 238 billion to reach 100%
[02:44:16.720 --> 02:44:20.520]  of gross domestic product of the government's debt ceiling was lifted
[02:44:20.520 --> 02:44:25.640]  Treasury figures showed Wednesday Treasury borrowing jumped Tuesday the
[02:44:25.640 --> 02:44:29.920]  data showed immediately after President Obama signed into law increases in the
[02:44:29.920 --> 02:44:34.000]  debt ceiling so as you just said this isn't saying they gobbled up most of it
[02:44:34.000 --> 02:44:40.000]  as they gobbled it all up immediately well I think what the Prince is saying
[02:44:40.000 --> 02:44:46.480]  is that the debt raised increased enough that it's now equal to the to the
[02:44:46.480 --> 02:44:52.400]  gross domestic product and of course the gross domestic product may be falling
[02:44:52.400 --> 02:44:56.240]  and it may be overstated because they've been understating inflation and if you
[02:44:56.240 --> 02:45:03.280]  understate inflation it looks like you've got more than you've got I think
[02:45:03.280 --> 02:45:09.840]  Alex said during World War two and the debt was actually a larger share of the
[02:45:09.840 --> 02:45:17.800]  gross domestic product than right now but there is a big difference in that we
[02:45:17.800 --> 02:45:22.800]  now have the during World War two we didn't have an all-sure economy the
[02:45:22.800 --> 02:45:27.680]  economy was still here and so going into debt in the four years was building the
[02:45:27.680 --> 02:45:32.280]  real physical economy so at the end of it we were the kings of the earth so so
[02:45:32.280 --> 02:45:37.680]  now we have the economy it's in Japan and India and Indonesia and where and
[02:45:37.680 --> 02:45:44.680]  wherever so you can't revive that economy by printing money and running
[02:45:44.680 --> 02:45:49.600]  deficits and I don't think the policymakers or the economics profession
[02:45:49.600 --> 02:45:53.800]  have have caught on to that and the dilemma they have and I think Bob will
[02:45:53.800 --> 02:46:01.360]  agree with this is that they're trying to have quantitative easing and flood the
[02:46:01.360 --> 02:46:07.640]  system with money it's not causing inflation as you would expect because
[02:46:07.640 --> 02:46:11.600]  it's staying in the banks when it when it when it gets back to the banking
[02:46:11.600 --> 02:46:17.840]  system it halts they're not using the reserves to create a lot of new loans and
[02:46:17.840 --> 02:46:24.240]  so we're not having as high a rate of money creation in the overall economy as
[02:46:24.240 --> 02:46:30.080]  the Fed is creating and and so we're not having inflation that way but all this
[02:46:30.080 --> 02:46:34.800]  outpouring worries the rest of the world about the dollar because they hold all
[02:46:34.800 --> 02:46:40.000]  their central bank reserves and in dollars and they see all this and so the
[02:46:40.000 --> 02:46:45.360]  dollar is taking the hit and then the inflation we get comes in from the fall
[02:46:45.360 --> 02:46:50.960]  and the exchange value of the dollar I look today and it looked like the Swiss
[02:46:50.960 --> 02:46:56.880]  Frank had made another new high against the dollar where the mighty dollars now
[02:46:56.880 --> 02:47:04.800]  worth 76 Swiss cents so so the inflation we again or is coming in from the
[02:47:04.800 --> 02:47:12.800]  dollar's loss of exchange value and so now they're faced with you can't support
[02:47:12.800 --> 02:47:20.400]  the dollar and save the dollar and also bail out the banks monetize the
[02:47:20.400 --> 02:47:27.000]  treasurer's debt so which are they gonna choose they have one crisis and then and
[02:47:27.000 --> 02:47:31.640]  then when that crisis becomes clear they'll try to do the opposite and then
[02:47:31.640 --> 02:47:35.960]  the other crisis so it's like a balancing act in a cartoon where you've got a
[02:47:35.960 --> 02:47:39.160]  hundred different plates and pots in your hand it's only a matter of time till
[02:47:39.160 --> 02:47:44.760]  it falls but Bob Chapman your take on what he's saying you know I agree with all
[02:47:44.760 --> 02:47:53.320]  of it I think they can't be understated the free free trade globalization
[02:47:53.320 --> 02:47:59.440]  offshoring outsourcing has cost us 11.7 million jobs in almost 11 years
[02:47:59.440 --> 02:48:08.720]  440,000 400 companies have moved out of the country and without those kinds of
[02:48:08.720 --> 02:48:17.400]  manufacturing we can never ever recover and so how do you change that we need
[02:48:17.400 --> 02:48:22.280]  legislation which would put tariffs and goods and services so that we can play
[02:48:22.280 --> 02:48:27.480]  in a level level playing field how you see every day Japan's in the in the
[02:48:27.480 --> 02:48:31.960]  market because their occurrences too strong so they're trying to make it
[02:48:31.960 --> 02:48:37.240]  week the Swiss just did the same thing they've been both unsuccessful for those
[02:48:37.240 --> 02:48:43.680]  who want stronger currencies I think eventually a lot of that money is going
[02:48:43.680 --> 02:48:52.280]  to go into gold maybe silver as well and so what we have is a an economy that
[02:48:52.280 --> 02:48:58.360]  even if it wanted to couldn't recover it at the same time as Mr. Robert said they
[02:48:58.360 --> 02:49:05.560]  the banks are holding gougabs of money two trillion onshore actually it's a
[02:49:05.560 --> 02:49:09.880]  little higher than that and they're not using it well that was my next question
[02:49:09.880 --> 02:49:13.760]  what's this statement today that big banks in the US are going to start
[02:49:13.760 --> 02:49:18.640]  charging people including big institutions charging them to hold their
[02:49:18.640 --> 02:49:23.080]  their cash I thought that was only the case in money laundering Dr. Roberts I
[02:49:23.080 --> 02:49:27.400]  don't know why they're doing it you know Switzerland did that back in the 80s
[02:49:27.400 --> 02:49:32.840]  when gold was up the dollar was having trouble because so many so much foreign
[02:49:32.840 --> 02:49:37.560]  money was pouring into Switzerland at the time it was driving the Frank too
[02:49:37.560 --> 02:49:41.480]  high so in the way you put money in Switzerland then was you open the
[02:49:41.480 --> 02:49:47.880]  bank account and so they would charge you if you put your dollars there I don't
[02:49:47.880 --> 02:49:52.600]  know what the banks here are doing it for maybe they're just desperate for fees
[02:49:52.600 --> 02:49:58.440]  and money and maybe they realize that that people with big holdings don't
[02:49:58.440 --> 02:50:02.640]  trust the stock market and realize that the bond market might be the next to
[02:50:02.640 --> 02:50:07.720]  tumble and so there's no cash it's so they're gonna let me throw this out real
[02:50:07.720 --> 02:50:10.520]  quick because we're going to break and we're gonna come back and see where this
[02:50:10.520 --> 02:50:15.080]  is going with Dr. Roberts then we'll continue on with with Bob Chapman why
[02:50:15.080 --> 02:50:19.280]  do you think the Italian government has raided Moody's and S&P the rating
[02:50:19.280 --> 02:50:25.760]  agencies in Italy I don't know about that that's Bob either but I can tell you
[02:50:25.760 --> 02:50:33.400]  that they would be trying to coerce them just back to the charging of interest
[02:50:33.400 --> 02:50:38.600]  on large deposit they want to drive that money into the Treasury market that's
[02:50:38.600 --> 02:50:43.720]  my take on it yeah so they want to force folks out of just sitting in bank
[02:50:43.720 --> 02:50:47.960]  accounts and to prop up Treasury so the Fed doesn't have to monetize it because
[02:50:47.960 --> 02:50:51.200]  they claim they're gonna cut back on that okay I want to see where Dr. Roberts
[02:50:51.200 --> 02:50:54.640]  thinks this is economy is it going and then we'll get a final comment in the
[02:50:54.640 --> 02:50:57.880]  hour from Bob Chapman then Bob will stay with us 30 more minutes we'll be right
[02:50:57.880 --> 02:51:04.320]  back on the other side stay with us will I have garlic breath after I take
[02:51:04.320 --> 02:51:07.840]  Ali see we get that question all the time about the world's best garlic
[02:51:07.840 --> 02:51:13.080]  extract Ali see and the answer is Ali see contains stabilized Allison nature's

[02:51:20.360 --> 02:51:24.560]  using low doses of Allison greatly reduces the number severity and duration
[02:51:24.560 --> 02:51:29.040]  of common colds our powerful Ali see contains 300 milligrams of stabilized
[02:51:29.040 --> 02:51:34.040]  Allison just one tablet of Ali see is equivalent to 40 garlic cloves it's
[02:51:34.040 --> 02:51:38.520]  effective against asthma MRSA bacterial fungal and viral infections and helps
[02:51:38.520 --> 02:51:42.280]  lower high blood pressure and high cholesterol plus it's a natural mosquito

[02:54:37.800 --> 02:54:43.360]  eating maize grain in April being lectured by the Chinese I mean what
[02:54:43.360 --> 02:54:47.520]  have we let these foreign bankers do to us Italy to take up balanced budget
[02:54:47.520 --> 02:54:52.680]  amendment stock market shooting up and down now it's plunging again we'll be
[02:54:52.680 --> 02:54:57.880]  covering come up the next 30 minutes it's just so crazy two-year Treasury
[02:54:57.880 --> 02:55:02.160]  yield drops dr. Roberts I remember three years ago you said well if we don't turn
[02:55:02.160 --> 02:55:09.520]  this around we'll basically be at where we've now come to in three years so where
[02:55:09.520 --> 02:55:13.080]  if this continues and clearly they're not changing the policies you know we
[02:55:13.080 --> 02:55:16.680]  always talk about solutions they don't care they like what's happening it's
[02:55:16.680 --> 02:55:21.200]  consolidating power now you're saying well they just must be idiots but at the
[02:55:21.200 --> 02:55:24.480]  end of the day I mean they're not complete moron so they're all making
[02:55:24.480 --> 02:55:28.800]  record bonuses in these big mega banks so where is this going where does this
[02:55:28.800 --> 02:55:36.040]  course we're on right now with this mad captain take us to the third world we
[02:55:36.040 --> 02:55:43.440]  will be a third world country in another 12 15 years and that's that's where
[02:55:43.440 --> 02:55:49.400]  we're going that's what I predicted at the beginning of this new century and
[02:55:49.400 --> 02:55:55.520]  there's no no departure from that course it's going to be a third world
[02:55:55.520 --> 02:56:04.600]  economy and there are a lot of villains and who will be responsible and as you
[02:56:04.600 --> 02:56:12.680]  say they seem to be happy with it but I still maintain they don't understand
[02:56:12.680 --> 02:56:18.840]  what's what's going on or they don't understand enough of what's going what's
[02:56:18.840 --> 02:56:23.640]  going on well a lot of them talk about a post industrial world and how great you
[02:56:23.640 --> 02:56:28.120]  know the the recession's been to cut carbon footprint I got a whole foods and
[02:56:28.120 --> 02:56:32.440]  half the magazines for the sandal trendies is about how great it is to be
[02:56:32.440 --> 02:56:38.200]  poor and how America needs to fall apart I mean I I think you underestimate just
[02:56:38.200 --> 02:56:43.160]  how wicked these people are yeah but they don't benefit from destroying a
[02:56:43.160 --> 02:56:52.080]  powerful economy where they have huge stakes so that's why I don't understand
[02:56:52.080 --> 02:56:55.360]  if they have America captured why would they want to destroy it because the
[02:56:55.360 --> 02:56:59.600]  globalists hate us that much I mean they can't help it they'd rather I think
[02:56:59.600 --> 02:57:05.720]  Alex this is self-inflicted and this is this is self-inflicted it was Wall
[02:57:05.720 --> 02:57:15.200]  Street and the big retailers that drove the American industry are sure and and
[02:57:15.200 --> 02:57:20.840]  hired all the name economists to call it globalism and say that we were
[02:57:20.840 --> 02:57:27.720]  benefiting and to pretend it's free trade and so it's domestically and then it
[02:57:27.720 --> 02:57:32.600]  was a Bush and Cheney who launched us on these interimble wars here we've been
[02:57:32.600 --> 02:57:39.920]  at war now for ten years they've wasted more on these wars than they hope to
[02:57:39.920 --> 02:57:44.760]  recover from the debt limit deal you mean they've launched kinetic actions a
[02:57:44.760 --> 02:57:53.480]  piece sir yeah right and so what they're caught between an unfunded military
[02:57:53.480 --> 02:58:00.800]  budget a deteriorating tax base you know every time a job is off short of the
[02:58:00.800 --> 02:58:08.880]  income the tax base the GDP goes with it and as Bob says their the main problem
[02:58:08.880 --> 02:58:14.280]  is to keep financing a massive deficit that's not going away in fact as I said
[02:58:14.280 --> 02:58:19.520]  the other day the deficit projections will have to be reissued before long and
[02:58:19.520 --> 02:58:24.960]  because the economy is falling down again they don't think be larger they're
[02:58:24.960 --> 02:58:29.280]  gonna be bigger deficits and so they've got to finance these deficits and so how
[02:58:29.280 --> 02:58:32.800]  they're gonna do it there's not enough world savings to do it the Chinese and
[02:58:32.800 --> 02:58:36.400]  Japanese so bottom line we're falling apart dr. Paul Craig Roberts author of
[02:58:36.400 --> 02:58:39.600]  war the world's how the economy was lost thank you see you back this Sunday
[02:58:39.600 --> 02:58:45.120]  4 to 6 p.m. we're going into overdrive it or not only thank you for listening to
[02:58:45.120 --> 02:58:53.680]  GCN visit GCN live comm today this is Alex Jones with five good reasons you
[02:58:53.680 --> 02:58:57.560]  should consider buying a solar power generator number one new climate
[02:58:57.560 --> 02:59:01.360]  legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill number two our
[02:59:01.360 --> 02:59:05.280]  new energies are wants to control how much power your electric company allows
[02:59:05.280 --> 02:59:09.640]  you to have it's true total government control of electricity in the name of
[02:59:09.640 --> 02:59:14.120]  smart grid technology is coming number three in some areas of the country the
[02:59:14.120 --> 02:59:18.840]  power grid is dangerously overloaded and now new socialist legislation is only
[02:59:18.840 --> 02:59:22.640]  compounding the problem number four dangerous weather is always a threat to
[02:59:22.640 --> 02:59:26.240]  local grids every year thousands of families lose their power from weather
[02:59:26.240 --> 02:59:30.600]  related onages number five a solar power generator provides powerful backup
[02:59:30.600 --> 02:59:33.760]  insurance and peace of mind folks I really believe in the solar power
[02:59:33.760 --> 02:59:37.440]  generators offered by solution from science one of my oldest sponsors you
[02:59:37.440 --> 02:59:42.200]  can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com that's my solar
[02:59:42.200 --> 02:59:46.480]  backup.com remember the government doesn't own the sun so go to my solar
[02:59:46.480 --> 02:59:56.200]  backup.com or call 1-877-327-0365 coast to coast direct from Austin you're
[02:59:56.200 --> 03:00:01.920]  listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network
[03:00:01.920 --> 03:00:17.480]  all right Bob Chapman is our guest to be with us for the next 30 minutes we're
[03:00:17.480 --> 03:00:21.840]  gonna jam some of your phone calls in here as well said Anderson will be
[03:00:21.840 --> 03:00:27.400]  popping into coming up the next segment you know Roberts is a smart guy great
[03:00:27.400 --> 03:00:32.160]  guy but I mean I've read the UN documents I've seen their statements
[03:00:32.160 --> 03:00:36.240]  about destroying economies to consolidate them they don't want free market
[03:00:36.240 --> 03:00:41.080]  economies anymore they don't want people having a future stake in things and
[03:00:41.080 --> 03:00:46.160]  they're gonna bring down the third world China Russia Europe everybody they've
[03:00:46.160 --> 03:00:51.000]  set up a system where we're dependent on resources an industrialized modern
[03:00:51.000 --> 03:00:56.240]  state they cut them off just like the beers has a monopoly on diamonds that
[03:00:56.240 --> 03:00:59.960]  are semi-precious but are ultra precious because of their monopoly same thing
[03:00:59.960 --> 03:01:03.800]  with oil they pushed the idea that it's super scarce when we're drowning in it
[03:01:03.800 --> 03:01:07.560]  and they have every foppish fake intellectual telling you we're out of
[03:01:07.560 --> 03:01:13.200]  oil this is a planned program post-industrial society just like
[03:01:13.200 --> 03:01:17.400]  California putting 20% carbon taxes when they're falling into the you know
[03:01:17.400 --> 03:01:22.480]  ocean and got a 30 plus percent unemployment rate this is their goal
[03:01:22.480 --> 03:01:28.440]  this is their goal this is economic conquest scorched earth Bob Chapman do
[03:01:28.440 --> 03:01:33.960]  you disagree with that statement I agree completely and the final analysis is
[03:01:33.960 --> 03:01:38.040]  this fascist model that they put into being which we always thought would
[03:01:38.040 --> 03:01:44.080]  probably be an extension of communism is set up to bring the world to their
[03:01:44.080 --> 03:01:48.960]  knees particularly Western Europe and the United States and Great Britain so
[03:01:48.960 --> 03:01:53.520]  that people will be forced to accept this new world order this one world
[03:01:53.520 --> 03:01:59.400]  government absolutely and and they're setting up owned homeland they claim is
[03:01:59.400 --> 03:02:03.080]  for the Muslims notice they flip it now onto the people that don't like the
[03:02:03.080 --> 03:02:08.000]  foreign bankers oh you don't like the occupation of finance capital who are
[03:02:08.000 --> 03:02:11.320]  non-free market oh well you're a terrorist and you can see the writing on
[03:02:11.320 --> 03:02:14.760]  the wall they're gonna blow stuff up and blame it on us Bob I mean they had a
[03:02:14.760 --> 03:02:20.560]  right they had a media matter absolutely go ahead no you go ahead I'm just
[03:02:20.560 --> 03:02:25.240]  agreeing with adjectives you're right no it's just it's disgusting media
[03:02:25.240 --> 03:02:29.200]  matters took me out of context yesterday and by the end of the article it applies
[03:02:29.200 --> 03:02:33.640]  I'm calling for murdering police when it's the opposite I mean they're really
[03:02:33.640 --> 03:02:36.920]  getting ready to try to set us up because we're kicking their hind in Bob
[03:02:36.920 --> 03:02:41.040]  that's right and we're gonna continue to do it and we're not gonna get sucked
[03:02:41.040 --> 03:02:45.080]  into their vortex of evil they're not gonna be able to get away with it because
[03:02:45.080 --> 03:02:49.080]  too many people out there know what they're up to it's just like all of the
[03:02:49.080 --> 03:02:53.760]  information that you came up with that you believe was going to happen about
[03:02:53.760 --> 03:03:01.240]  whitey the terrorists and there he was he appeared in Oslo and that was what you
[03:03:01.240 --> 03:03:05.600]  were talking about and you predicted that they would do something like that
[03:03:05.600 --> 03:03:10.040]  and they did but if there's any doubt now this week with the vice president all
[03:03:10.040 --> 03:03:14.440]  of them saying and the New York Times and Politico hundreds yes whitey is the
[03:03:14.440 --> 03:03:19.280]  terrorists the Tea Party are going to bomb us I mean folks how obvious they're
[03:03:19.280 --> 03:03:22.880]  saying we're gonna bomb them and then they got White House memos about how a
[03:03:22.880 --> 03:03:28.440]  bombing will help them police who should you be looking at if you were living in
[03:03:28.440 --> 03:03:32.320]  the real world I mean Bob you worked in intelligence who would you look at you
[03:03:32.320 --> 03:03:35.360]  got groups saying boy a terror attack would sure help us they start saying
[03:03:35.360 --> 03:03:39.240]  this group's gonna bomb I mean right there you got them they're getting ready
[03:03:39.240 --> 03:03:46.440]  to do it that's right and you know they really make so many mistakes and they
[03:03:46.440 --> 03:03:51.280]  have to scramble to cover it up like in this Oslo affair and on all the others
[03:03:51.280 --> 03:03:56.440]  that they've made and because they control the meteor and almost totality
[03:03:56.440 --> 03:04:01.400]  at least the main mainstream that they can get away with it they keep on
[03:04:01.400 --> 03:04:06.960]  telling the same lie over and over again and in sometimes in variations as we
[03:04:06.960 --> 03:04:14.160]  saw today and and what did the Joseph Kerr will say the same thing you keep on
[03:04:14.160 --> 03:04:22.560]  telling him the same lie and they're gonna believe it the good news is 69%
[03:04:22.560 --> 03:04:27.080]  in a Rasmussen poll believe the scientists are lying about global warming
[03:04:27.080 --> 03:04:32.440]  and now they're having to admit okay there was less ice 5000 years ago okay
[03:04:32.440 --> 03:04:37.560]  the Sun does heat the earth I mean more and more their ridiculous lies are
[03:04:37.560 --> 03:04:44.800]  coming home to bottom in their man bear pig hind ends only sure are and they're
[03:04:44.800 --> 03:04:51.000]  rightly so and they expect all of us to be dumb and you know something there's a
[03:04:51.000 --> 03:04:56.360]  lot of smart people in the world besides them and they outnumber the people who

[03:07:07.720 --> 03:07:15.360]  Revelation 6 11 states they will Revelation 13 7 states they will also and
[03:07:15.360 --> 03:07:20.520]  then in Revelation 20 verse 4 states that some in the resurrection will have
[03:07:20.520 --> 03:07:26.200]  been beheading for the witness of Jesus Christ beheading is usually done with a
[03:07:26.200 --> 03:07:31.520]  guillotine could that be why guillotines are stored on every military base in

[03:08:31.120 --> 03:08:38.440]  and gentlemen well into overdrive so fix bayonets we are into overdrive here on
[03:08:38.440 --> 03:08:42.960]  this Friday edition I'll be back this Sunday live 4 to 6 p.m. Central Bob
[03:08:42.960 --> 03:08:47.120]  Chapman's our guest I want to go to the callers that are patiently holding there
[03:08:47.120 --> 03:08:51.080]  in just a moment but this is how tyranny works we're just incrementally
[03:08:51.080 --> 03:08:56.680]  watching big offshore banks gut Europe gut the United States just as they have
[03:08:56.680 --> 03:09:01.680]  absolutely robbed and butchered the third world and they do it over and over
[03:09:01.680 --> 03:09:05.800]  again now the good news is Hillary's a big presence key many others have pointed
[03:09:05.800 --> 03:09:10.080]  out for the first time in modern history people aren't looking at the puppets
[03:09:10.080 --> 03:09:14.640]  they're looking at the shadow government the globalist great power is that they
[03:09:14.640 --> 03:09:20.240]  hide it behind bureaucracy and corporatism but once you start educating
[03:09:20.240 --> 03:09:24.920]  people they can't get away with this anymore and it you know truth goes
[03:09:24.920 --> 03:09:29.440]  through three stages first it's ignored then it's attacked then it becomes
[03:09:29.440 --> 03:09:32.920]  self-evident and we it's in the attack phase but more and more people it's
[03:09:32.920 --> 03:09:36.680]  becoming self-evident now what do we get them to do we get them to speak out to
[03:09:36.680 --> 03:09:40.240]  their friends their family their neighbors because just the moral authority
[03:09:40.240 --> 03:09:44.680]  of knowing the truth it all ends the police are putting trial balloons out
[03:09:44.680 --> 03:09:49.480]  all over the country people do editorials mildly making fun of police with
[03:09:49.480 --> 03:09:54.240]  stick figure YouTube video they are trying to indict them for felonies in
[03:09:54.240 --> 03:09:58.000]  in Oregon they're arresting folks videotaping police from their own
[03:09:58.000 --> 03:10:04.320]  houses we've got to get control of our political employees and let them know
[03:10:04.320 --> 03:10:08.400]  that we're the boss so there's a real attempt to bring in tyranny that's the
[03:10:08.400 --> 03:10:12.720]  system's answer to hey we screwed up everything and robbed everything and now
[03:10:12.720 --> 03:10:17.480]  it's time for you to go along with that and let us take over even more of your
[03:10:17.480 --> 03:10:23.880]  life we've got to say no we've got to get to that point gold heads for fifth
[03:10:23.880 --> 03:10:29.600]  weekly advance on US European debt woes they it exploded I don't know 80
[03:10:29.600 --> 03:10:33.200]  something bucks last few weeks then they drove it down 15 bucks and it surged
[03:10:33.200 --> 03:10:38.920]  right back up to where it was a lot of stuff's happening there the Chinese are
[03:10:38.920 --> 03:10:44.120]  saying look your debt ceiling's a disaster this whole thing's going down
[03:10:44.120 --> 03:10:48.640]  Ron Paul's pointed that out we've got it we've now got a super creepy Congress
[03:10:48.640 --> 03:10:52.960]  that's totally unconstitutional Ted Anderson I'm bringing you in here owner
[03:10:52.960 --> 03:10:57.160]  of the network and of modest resources because you've got your nose in the
[03:10:57.160 --> 03:11:01.800]  grindstone there Ted what's the latest golden silver news what's happened in
[03:11:01.800 --> 03:11:05.200]  the last few hours and then I'll give folks what's happening in the stock
[03:11:05.200 --> 03:11:08.480]  market and then we'll get Bob's predictions and go to calls Ted Anderson
[03:11:08.480 --> 03:11:13.400]  yeah right here Alex I can tell you right now gold hit a high today of 1668 20
[03:11:13.400 --> 03:11:18.480]  and of course higher than that in the futures market silver today is hit a high
[03:11:18.480 --> 03:11:24.360]  of 3965 gold is the one that's running right now people the Europeans are
[03:11:24.360 --> 03:11:29.000]  dumping money into the system trying to stimulate their economies over there and
[03:11:29.000 --> 03:11:32.440]  that money is running to gold right now it's also running to us treasury bills
[03:11:32.440 --> 03:11:38.160]  the T bill is the yield on T bills are going down and gold is going up like
[03:11:38.160 --> 03:11:41.840]  crazy and that's because there's just way too much printing going on so we've
[03:11:41.840 --> 03:11:45.400]  had it here in the United States now it's occurring in Europe the Asians are
[03:11:45.400 --> 03:11:49.400]  looking at it and they're just trying to run away from it I was in Singapore here
[03:11:49.400 --> 03:11:54.400]  just about three weeks ago and they're four weeks ago and their gold shops are
[03:11:54.400 --> 03:11:59.680]  just packed with people trying to buy 24 karat gold sure I believe the G20 is
[03:11:59.680 --> 03:12:04.120]  devaluing all currencies it is only one or two sovereign countries and their
[03:12:04.120 --> 03:12:07.320]  currencies are actually going up or holding steady and gold is not up in
[03:12:07.320 --> 03:12:11.320]  those countries like Switzerland but but Ted I mean I want to simplify this for
[03:12:11.320 --> 03:12:15.160]  folks then get your taken Bob's take on it it's very simple people ask what's
[03:12:15.160 --> 03:12:21.720]  happening in the economy okay they are trying to depress the real economy so
[03:12:21.720 --> 03:12:28.160]  that their hyper printing of currencies doesn't cause hyper inflation but
[03:12:28.160 --> 03:12:31.320]  you're still getting the inflation in the commodities because that's sold
[03:12:31.320 --> 03:12:36.440]  globally and is being bought by big players and so you're getting the worst
[03:12:36.440 --> 03:12:40.600]  of two worlds but from the establishment's perspective make everybody
[03:12:40.600 --> 03:12:45.480]  poor while they quote hoard the cash and buy real assets Ted Anderson well
[03:12:45.480 --> 03:12:48.800]  that's exactly what happened here during the tarp and all the bailouts that
[03:12:48.800 --> 03:12:52.640]  happened during the banking thing I mean you we all heard Ron Paul say man if
[03:12:52.640 --> 03:12:57.600]  they put the money in the hands of the people we'd had $17,000 per person here
[03:12:57.600 --> 03:13:02.960]  in the United States instead they handed over to the globalists these huge
[03:13:02.960 --> 03:13:07.680]  mega banks and that were about ready to fail and all of a sudden now they start
[03:13:07.680 --> 03:13:12.520]  dishing out these huge dead Ted that's the fake numbers of tarp being 800
[03:13:12.520 --> 03:13:16.400]  something billion that in different ways they've gotten it we haven't gotten new
[03:13:16.400 --> 03:13:21.080]  numbers over a year and Ted do you know how big it is because a year ago Bob it
[03:13:21.080 --> 03:13:25.160]  was 27 trillion Bloomberg said that the banks had gotten them our money that we
[03:13:25.160 --> 03:13:28.480]  got to pay them back in taxes yeah we give them money and then pay taxes to
[03:13:28.480 --> 03:13:31.480]  give them the money that do we have any idea in the last year how much that's
[03:13:31.480 --> 03:13:36.200]  gone up Bob because they're keeping their trap shut well the GAO the other day
[03:13:36.200 --> 03:13:42.400]  said it was 16.1 trillion which included US as well as European banks and I had
[03:13:42.400 --> 03:13:47.440]  projected 13.8 trillion but that was a secret loan three years ago well then
[03:13:47.440 --> 03:13:53.040]  how does Bloomberg how does Bloomberg say 27 trillion then I don't know I've not
[03:13:53.040 --> 03:13:58.400]  seen the figure as yet and I'm I'm I would want to break down well sure I
[03:13:58.400 --> 03:14:04.240]  mean it's old at first they said 27.3 remember that headline and then there
[03:14:04.240 --> 03:14:08.640]  was another 5 trillion or so later they announced but I guess that was total I
[03:14:08.640 --> 03:14:14.800]  mean I mean all the different ways they get money could be you know and and
[03:14:14.800 --> 03:14:18.840]  Bloomberg's part of the part of the problem except when they make the
[03:14:18.840 --> 03:14:24.960]  mistake of asking the Fed where all the money went but they I think it's just a
[03:14:24.960 --> 03:14:30.240]  straight-up mistake or they didn't explain where that figure came from but
[03:14:30.240 --> 03:14:36.520]  that's okay and the bottom line is it's a lot of money a growth a lot of money
[03:14:36.520 --> 03:14:42.760]  and so we don't even know whether we got it back because the GAO didn't tell us
[03:14:42.760 --> 03:14:49.240]  that and so we may have gotten none of it back absolutely and you know in the
[03:14:49.240 --> 03:14:54.880]  tarp funds we still know that there's money that hasn't come back some came
[03:14:54.880 --> 03:15:02.960]  back probably I'll guess it's 600 billion so there's 250 billion still
[03:15:02.960 --> 03:15:06.920]  wandering around just in that program alone but there's so many programs that
[03:15:06.920 --> 03:15:10.080]  we don't know anything about and then they have all these swap agreements
[03:15:10.080 --> 03:15:16.120]  between the Fed and other central banks and none of that figured in and then if
[03:15:16.120 --> 03:15:22.120]  you look over on the on the left-hand side you'll see 1.4 quadrillion worth
[03:15:22.120 --> 03:15:28.840]  of derivatives of which in the United States about 83% has been written by
[03:15:28.840 --> 03:15:36.160]  JP Morgan Chase who's a major shareholder in the Federal Reserve. Ted Anderson
[03:15:36.160 --> 03:15:40.280]  there's no end to this I want to go to phone calls but but obviously we have
[03:15:40.280 --> 03:15:43.240]  some silver and gold deals from when Ted bought silver and gold when it was
[03:15:43.240 --> 03:15:46.520]  lower he can now pass those savings on they're not as good as they were two
[03:15:46.520 --> 03:15:50.160]  months ago as he sold out of the stuff then but it's continued to go up so this
[03:15:50.160 --> 03:15:54.360]  is a win-win-win because Ted doesn't go up in prices even when gold and silver
[03:15:54.360 --> 03:15:58.640]  goes up he sells what he had at the at the lower price even though it's higher
[03:15:58.640 --> 03:16:02.960]  and that's why he's so incredibly competitive but but before we plug that
[03:16:02.960 --> 03:16:06.720]  and give folks today's offer and it will go up next week Ted's told me and
[03:16:06.720 --> 03:16:10.080]  prices continue like this so I take advantage of it today and throughout the
[03:16:10.080 --> 03:16:14.120]  weekend brokers will be there but Bob Chapman what do you expect to happen to
[03:16:14.120 --> 03:16:20.000]  go by the fall now even a normal doldrum time like the middle of summer or
[03:16:20.000 --> 03:16:26.520]  latter summer the prices are exploding right now I think technically we're
[03:16:26.520 --> 03:16:33.560]  looking at 1750 by the end of the month and that's just it's a stretch but
[03:16:33.560 --> 03:16:38.080]  that's what we're looking at during supposedly the weakest part of the year
[03:16:38.080 --> 03:16:42.600]  and people always forget that jewelry manufacturers throughout the world have
[03:16:42.600 --> 03:16:47.080]  to start ordering the gold and silver and platinum and palladium for the
[03:16:47.080 --> 03:16:51.240]  coming season how much of this product line are they going to make and how many
[03:16:51.240 --> 03:16:57.680]  orders they have to come in so sometimes people miss that anyway we can easily
[03:16:57.680 --> 03:17:04.240]  see 2200 by the end of the year and if things go bonkers in the last quarter
[03:17:04.240 --> 03:17:09.040]  which they could very well be going that way we've had horrible experience just
[03:17:09.040 --> 03:17:12.920]  recently in the American market and then we look over to Europe it's bad and they
[03:17:12.920 --> 03:17:18.080]  really don't have an agreement because the people in Germany and
[03:17:18.080 --> 03:17:23.840]  Holland and in Finland they say no we don't want to do that and the head of
[03:17:23.840 --> 03:17:29.200]  the the European Central Bank and others within that banking structure I say no
[03:17:29.200 --> 03:17:32.800]  no we have to have the money we have to give the money we can't let this drink
[03:17:32.800 --> 03:17:40.400]  collapse we can't lose the Euro we we can't lose the European Union and so you
[03:17:40.400 --> 03:17:44.240]  got all these things come confluencing and it's gonna happen during the last
[03:17:44.240 --> 03:17:51.200]  quarter so maybe 2000 and 2200 is conservative they just blasted silver
[03:17:51.200 --> 03:17:57.360]  down from 42 to 38 it'll turn around and go right back up again absolutely
[03:17:57.360 --> 03:18:01.640]  Ted Anderson now your view on what Bob just said well he's exactly right and
[03:18:01.640 --> 03:18:06.800]  Robert Colin Robertson of Chicago's North Northern Trust Corporation is
[03:18:06.800 --> 03:18:11.640]  saying that it's a clear-cut panic in the markets right now and that's what
[03:18:11.640 --> 03:18:15.040]  that's what they're reporting I mean there is so much going on Alex you got
[03:18:15.040 --> 03:18:19.920]  to realize Europe is melting apart the United States is multi-melting you've
[03:18:19.920 --> 03:18:24.440]  got Asia fallen apart there is a shortage right now in silver coins and
[03:18:24.440 --> 03:18:28.200]  gold coins in the marketplace no it's not Bob Chapman or Alex Jones or Ted
[03:18:28.200 --> 03:18:33.120]  Anderson three years ago saying the Euro would collapse now it's all over the
[03:18:33.120 --> 03:18:37.480]  news every day now the New York Times is admitting we're in a depression I mean
[03:18:37.480 --> 03:18:41.800]  they've known all along continue Ted well that's just it I mean that's just
[03:18:41.800 --> 03:18:46.840]  just this last spring it was so hard to get silver that it was almost impossible
[03:18:46.840 --> 03:18:51.000]  to get silver eagles the US meant quit making them there wasn't enough to go
[03:18:51.000 --> 03:18:55.880]  around I would I would try to buy 60,000 silver eagles from a dealer and find out
[03:18:55.880 --> 03:18:59.680]  that only can get 10 and then after I mean I'd call all over the place just to
[03:18:59.680 --> 03:19:04.160]  try to keep enough supply on hand so I could meet the demand for my customers
[03:19:04.160 --> 03:19:08.360]  you got to realize I'm not the only gold dealer in the United States or in the
[03:19:08.360 --> 03:19:12.080]  world I mean they're they're all look we know it's admitted most of them are
[03:19:12.080 --> 03:19:16.880]  are actually taking orders and then trying to find it later you everything
[03:19:16.880 --> 03:19:20.920]  you've got is down at a bank in a vault in a shipped out every day as the orders
[03:19:20.920 --> 03:19:25.360]  comes in correct Ted you've got it on hand yeah we got we we've got most
[03:19:25.360 --> 03:19:28.480]  everything on hand I mean every now and then we might end up short but I can tell
[03:19:28.480 --> 03:19:33.240]  you Alex I'm out there buying all the time I mean I'm that that's that's the
[03:19:33.240 --> 03:19:37.240]  challenge right now not finding customers to buy this stuff people are
[03:19:37.240 --> 03:19:41.440]  going to be really sadly mistaken oh yeah that's what you've told me you've
[03:19:41.440 --> 03:19:45.720]  you've you've actually off off record Ted's like Alex I'm having to buy gold
[03:19:45.720 --> 03:19:50.440]  three months out just to even get it in silver it's horrible oh I wish there'd
[03:19:50.440 --> 03:19:55.080]  be a dip so yeah and if you're one of the biggest brokers in the country now

[03:21:03.560 --> 03:21:07.920]  that the point is Alex I mean first of all you sent us a truckload of this
[03:21:07.920 --> 03:21:12.200]  stuff we had to reorder it for you those videos are getting in the hands of
[03:21:12.200 --> 03:21:15.760]  people they're handing them off people are understanding now they're learning
[03:21:15.760 --> 03:21:19.520]  about the Federal Reserve System the way the money comes into existence this
[03:21:19.520 --> 03:21:24.360]  information is critical to have the neat part about it is is that there's a whole
[03:21:24.360 --> 03:21:29.040]  army of people out there now that have two silver dollars a piece and those two
[03:21:29.040 --> 03:21:33.400]  silver dollars could mean the difference between eating in a week's time
[03:21:33.400 --> 03:21:38.000]  and not because we're having an economic crisis you'll need silver you might as
[03:21:38.000 --> 03:21:42.240]  well get the stuff anyways and then by gosh take that video watch it yourself
[03:21:42.240 --> 03:21:46.720]  find a friend find a family member hand it to them and say you watch it too when
[03:21:46.720 --> 03:21:50.680]  you're done with it pass it on because that's what's gonna save this country
[03:21:50.680 --> 03:21:55.080]  that we people we the people have to stand up and fight for it and you're not
[03:21:55.080 --> 03:21:58.360]  gonna even know how to fight for it if you don't understand what's getting you
[03:21:58.360 --> 03:22:03.280]  the system is eating us alive and we need a tool to get out there and spread
[03:22:03.280 --> 03:22:07.960]  the word and that American dream video is the tool that works I mean believe me
[03:22:07.960 --> 03:22:11.840]  it's entertaining it's riveting people watch it they know what's going on by
[03:22:11.840 --> 03:22:15.480]  the time they're done they want to do something yeah this is it's only like a
[03:22:15.480 --> 03:22:20.720]  35-minute film and it's it's animated South Park style it's slightly
[03:22:20.720 --> 03:22:24.600]  racy but you know even you know ten year olds can watch it I don't know if I
[03:22:24.600 --> 03:22:28.720]  let my nine-year-old watch it but the point is is that it's really great and
[03:22:28.720 --> 03:22:38.400]  shows the book 800-686-2237-1800-686-2237 and Ted before you go up on the
[03:22:38.400 --> 03:22:41.920]  golden silver when folks call just mention it's a radio Alex Jones special
[03:22:41.920 --> 03:22:45.200]  and they've got a whole list of the specials but if this continues you are
[03:22:45.200 --> 03:22:48.560]  gonna have to go up on prices on Monday again well I mean look how gold is doing
[03:22:48.560 --> 03:22:54.680]  Alex I mean we've seen 1688 dollars an ounce Bob is saying 1750 my goodness
[03:22:54.680 --> 03:22:58.400]  that's just right around the corner knocking remember we were crazy to say
[03:22:58.400 --> 03:23:03.840]  it would be a thousand then we were crazy to say 1500 now now 2000 seems
[03:23:03.840 --> 03:23:10.720]  reachable and again it's all dollar devaluation 800 686-2337 I like to say
[03:23:10.720 --> 03:23:15.440]  support the network support the show but this is a loss leader Ted's well pretty
[03:23:15.440 --> 03:23:19.120]  competitive he's certainly not a commie all well I can tell you one thing for
[03:23:19.120 --> 03:23:23.200]  sure you're not going to find a deal like this anywhere out there period
[03:23:23.200 --> 03:23:26.880]  there's nobody offering it like this and I don't know about the forecaster to
[03:23:26.880 --> 03:23:29.640]  that's another smoking well I mean that's that's another thing I mean if you
[03:23:29.640 --> 03:23:35.680]  take a look you buy one Frank for 362 dollars the forecasters 159 dollars per
[03:23:35.680 --> 03:23:41.600]  year if you it figures out to be about 965 dollars per ounce and so and gold
[03:23:41.600 --> 03:23:47.800]  right now is closer to 1700 so it's such a great buy to be able to get in there
[03:23:47.800 --> 03:23:52.760]  and then you get Bob's newsletter which is just you know 40 pages packed with
[03:23:52.760 --> 03:23:57.280]  information the economy right now with where it's going people think that they
[03:23:57.280 --> 03:24:01.240]  can wait and that's the point that I was trying to make before if you think that
[03:24:01.240 --> 03:24:04.320]  you can wait till things completely melt down and then you're gonna turn around
[03:24:04.320 --> 03:24:09.120]  and try to find gold and silver at some local coin shop or her perhaps not even
[03:24:09.120 --> 03:24:13.480]  might as resources there's just not enough supply when everything melts
[03:24:13.480 --> 03:24:17.480]  apart there's gonna be such a rush into gold and silver there's not gonna be in
[03:24:17.480 --> 03:24:22.640]  there just isn't gonna be enough to cover orders that's just raw reality right
[03:24:22.640 --> 03:24:25.800]  now we're dealing with about one and a half percent of the people getting into
[03:24:25.800 --> 03:24:29.880]  gold and silver if that number jumps to 10 we're toast there isn't going to be
[03:24:29.880 --> 03:24:35.720]  enough there absolutely ladies and gentlemen I got into gold when it was
[03:24:35.720 --> 03:24:40.480]  to remind me the numbers 250 I keep saying 300 I got into silver when it was
[03:24:40.480 --> 03:24:46.120]  $5 an ounce and I still buy gold and silver where it's at today and you know
[03:24:46.120 --> 03:24:49.840]  what when it when they knock it down and play their games I don't sell it it's an
[03:24:49.840 --> 03:24:54.920]  emergency backup and there's a whole list of great silver and gold deals they've
[03:24:54.920 --> 03:24:58.960]  got it's the radio specials his normal deals are excellent as well but the
[03:24:58.960 --> 03:25:03.360]  radio specials are the loss leaders I've seen the sheets on these even though he
[03:25:03.360 --> 03:25:08.320]  bought it when it was lower 2 to 5% is the markup with a guy with a business and
[03:25:08.320 --> 03:25:13.440]  the brokers and the taxes and all of it Ted is extremely extremely competitive
[03:25:13.440 --> 03:25:17.160]  and then when you add that the stuff's gone up you're getting this lower than
[03:25:17.160 --> 03:25:20.480]  you could find it anywhere else you might be able to find somebody in the
[03:25:20.480 --> 03:25:24.920]  super heart market who bought it when it was low and is being competitive but
[03:25:24.920 --> 03:25:29.840]  good luck Ted is a place that does this every day day in day out ask for the
[03:25:29.840 --> 03:25:35.120]  international forecaster special ask for the American dream special there's some
[03:25:35.120 --> 03:25:38.680]  other video specials we have there when you call to get even more silver
[03:25:38.680 --> 03:25:47.400]  dollars or gold coins just ask about all the specials 800 686 2237 800 686 237 I
[03:25:47.400 --> 03:25:51.800]  would not be up here saying buy silver and gold if I did not every bone in my
[03:25:51.800 --> 03:25:55.520]  body think it's going to go way up because of common sense and I've been
[03:25:55.520 --> 03:25:59.480]  right for 11 years and believe me I would almost want to be wrong in fact I
[03:25:59.480 --> 03:26:03.240]  of course I want to be wrong up and I am kind of egotistical like everybody
[03:26:03.240 --> 03:26:08.280]  else I wish they'd stop printing the money fix the economies start the
[03:26:08.280 --> 03:26:12.840]  tariffs raise the interest rates fix America and save it and then have gold
[03:26:12.840 --> 03:26:17.680]  plunge and people be mad at me okay because then we have a future and it's
[03:26:17.680 --> 03:26:20.880]  not going to be war on the streets and every piece of metal being torn off
[03:26:20.880 --> 03:26:25.160]  graves and air conditioners and everything else and crime exploding and
[03:26:25.160 --> 03:26:30.120]  mobs beating people up I would love to be wrong but unfortunately folks the
[03:26:30.120 --> 03:26:34.720]  globalists are full steam ahead into the iceberg field they this is their plan
[03:26:34.720 --> 03:26:39.920]  to sink this republic okay so they can make us jump on the USS new world order
[03:26:39.920 --> 03:26:43.920]  and so we're going to end up being right again because they're not changing
[03:26:43.920 --> 03:26:47.520]  course now they sort of changing course you'd see gold and silver start going
[03:26:47.520 --> 03:26:52.440]  down I don't mean for a month I mean precipitously but you don't see that
[03:26:52.440 --> 03:26:58.280]  Bob Chapman and the reason you don't see it is people all over the world even
[03:26:58.280 --> 03:27:03.760]  more so than in the United States are buying gold and silver or whose which is
[03:27:03.760 --> 03:27:09.880]  outside Frankfurt a large producer of ingots of gold and silver said the other
[03:27:09.880 --> 03:27:16.840]  day that they cannot keep up with the domestic German demand alone I mean
[03:27:16.840 --> 03:27:21.320]  that's dynamite and we're getting stories in the in the forecaster letters
[03:27:21.320 --> 03:27:29.800]  from people that in Athens they're going bananas buying gold and silver to get out
[03:27:29.800 --> 03:27:33.760]  of the Euro get their money out of the bank the same thing has happened in
[03:27:33.760 --> 03:27:40.440]  Lisbon and Abuelto and places like that it's the Americans haven't even woken up
[03:27:40.440 --> 03:27:46.680]  yet a 10 to 1% on gold and silver coins million and shares to get it I mean
[03:27:46.680 --> 03:27:51.640]  what's gonna what's gonna be like when it's 15% will gold be 10 to $15,000
[03:27:51.640 --> 03:27:58.120]  an ounce or will silver be perhaps a thousand or two an ounce probably
[03:27:58.120 --> 03:28:03.440]  absolutely gentlemen I promise to go to calls let's just do one more segment
[03:28:03.440 --> 03:28:09.600]  after this okay I'll do it Ted are you good I'll be here we're gonna come back
[03:28:09.600 --> 03:28:12.520]  take one segment of calls at a few other news items for everybody that's
[03:28:12.520 --> 03:28:16.240]  patiently holding but before we go any further Ted I keep getting calls here at
[03:28:16.240 --> 03:28:18.840]  the office ask me about the other specials they want me to list them
[03:28:18.840 --> 03:28:23.800]  explain the international forecaster special yeah international forecaster
[03:28:23.800 --> 03:28:28.040]  comes with the Frank coin the Frank coin is a European coin it contains

[03:28:47.720 --> 03:28:53.040]  long time and considerably people were buying the same thing for about $96 when

[03:29:07.480 --> 03:29:11.240]  digital one and it really is invaluable info I mean this is this is thick
[03:29:11.240 --> 03:29:16.160]  important wide-spectrum information but but but if I'm currently I'm wrong it's
[03:29:16.160 --> 03:29:20.280]  already very competitive deal on that Frank by itself it's not like you're
[03:29:20.280 --> 03:29:24.160]  paying more for a Frank and then and then getting the newsletter tell folks how
[03:29:24.160 --> 03:29:28.600]  much the Frank is how much is the deal $362 and you're gonna buy that you're
[03:29:28.600 --> 03:29:31.520]  gonna pay that for a Frank one way or the other Bob how good of a deal is that
[03:29:31.520 --> 03:29:35.920]  on a Frank just by itself well that's terrific it's right in line with the

[03:33:41.320 --> 03:33:46.760]  wars dot com special report it's not the nightly TV show that's info wars nightly
[03:33:46.760 --> 03:33:51.760]  five nights a week seven o'clock thirty minutes hard-hitting focused it's not
[03:33:51.760 --> 03:33:55.440]  even the same studio look this is this is the nightly news look and we're still
[03:33:55.440 --> 03:33:57.960]  getting the lighting and graphics everything together it's really a
[03:33:57.960 --> 03:34:02.120]  beta testing but we're gonna have the nightly news reports as well and that's
[03:34:02.120 --> 03:34:07.600]  why your membership set prison planet dot TV and buying the books the videos all
[03:34:07.600 --> 03:34:11.600]  of it that funds what we're doing we're not funded with banker bailout money I
[03:34:11.600 --> 03:34:17.240]  want to remind people of this hundreds of millions of dollars of the trillions
[03:34:17.240 --> 03:34:23.200]  are confirmed as of four months ago to have gone directly to MSNBC when Rachel
[03:34:23.200 --> 03:34:26.480]  Maddow gets out there and demonizes the founding fathers the second amendment
[03:34:26.480 --> 03:34:32.960]  Ron Paul she is paid by the Federal Reserve with US taxpayer money to do it
[03:34:32.960 --> 03:34:39.800]  we're not funded by them remember that and so I want to continue to expand I
[03:34:39.800 --> 03:34:45.120]  mean the more you fund us the more energy we've got that's all money is as
[03:34:45.120 --> 03:34:51.320]  symbols of energy that's all commodities are unless you can eat them and the point
[03:34:51.320 --> 03:34:55.560]  is and I guess using golden silver and manufactured they are eating their
[03:34:55.560 --> 03:35:00.600]  consumed point is they're consumable we have got we have got to go to the next
[03:35:00.600 --> 03:35:03.400]  level and we're doing it we're doing it we're doing it we're doing it because of
[03:35:03.400 --> 03:35:07.400]  your past support and as we go into this depression we're not hiding back and
[03:35:07.400 --> 03:35:12.560]  pulling in our our you know feelers and better watch it we're just like you know
[03:35:12.560 --> 03:35:16.520]  what I've got these reserves here for rainy day for this place spend them boom
[03:35:16.520 --> 03:35:22.520]  do the TV show build it and they will come boom use the reserves and so we
[03:35:22.520 --> 03:35:27.040]  need to refill those reserves so buy the books the videos the t-shirts all up at
[03:35:27.040 --> 03:35:32.920]  a prison planet on TV membership that's funny on YouTube they will gripe on the
[03:35:32.920 --> 03:35:38.600]  very video I can't believe he's charging for this as the video with like five
[03:35:38.600 --> 03:35:43.720]  crew members behind it building rent taxes as they're watching the video
[03:35:43.720 --> 03:35:48.520]  that's that's that streamed live on the subscriber site for free they are in
[03:35:48.520 --> 03:35:52.360]  there complaining and they're obviously trolls and operatives or they're people
[03:35:52.360 --> 03:35:55.080]  who are mentally ill and are living in their mother's basement and never live
[03:35:55.080 --> 03:35:58.680]  in the real world and I will tell you the reason to be a prison planet on TV
[03:35:58.680 --> 03:36:03.040]  member is because you get the streams first you get the higher quality archives
[03:36:03.040 --> 03:36:07.640]  and a lot of it is exclusive to prison planet TV and I'm not gonna just because
[03:36:07.640 --> 03:36:12.400]  of the trolls get angry and do what I normally do and just go okay none of it's
[03:36:12.400 --> 03:36:17.400]  free then you know again these people don't live in the real world I'm a
[03:36:17.400 --> 03:36:22.840]  capitalist I'm free market I want to be prosperous there's nothing wrong with
[03:36:22.840 --> 03:36:27.160]  that the bankers have taught us to be failures that people fighting for justice
[03:36:27.160 --> 03:36:33.480]  are supposed to be homeless no no no we're not funded with your tax money
[03:36:33.480 --> 03:36:37.920]  we're not funded with bailout money they stole from you like George Soros and
[03:36:37.920 --> 03:36:42.600]  the rest of them okay we're funded by people that support us and freely buy
[03:36:42.600 --> 03:36:46.480]  our books our videos our materials that are great deals and we give good
[03:36:46.480 --> 03:36:50.680]  information that's helped people and we predicted accurately what's happened and
[03:36:50.680 --> 03:36:55.160]  so I will tell folks again by the books by the videos by the prison planet dot
[03:36:55.160 --> 03:36:58.440]  TV memberships that's why one reason I went into overdrive the day was to take
[03:36:58.440 --> 03:37:02.840]  calls but to also ask for your support if you believe in what we're doing here
[03:37:02.840 --> 03:37:06.280]  do you have any comments Bob on people that don't live in the real world and
[03:37:06.280 --> 03:37:10.760]  and even when you give them something free then then urinate on it and say
[03:37:10.760 --> 03:37:15.880]  that it's evil that you gave it to them they'll always be with us and they
[03:37:15.880 --> 03:37:21.680]  always have been it takes all kinds of people to make up the world and we have
[03:37:21.680 --> 03:37:26.760]  to overlook those things keep the goals in sight keep on doing what we were
[03:37:26.760 --> 03:37:32.000]  doing and out of the whole help those who are willing to accept help and not
[03:37:32.000 --> 03:37:36.440]  complain about it but it's mentally ill to be on a YouTube channel and saying I
[03:37:36.440 --> 03:37:39.800]  can't believe he should give these videos away for free while they're
[03:37:39.800 --> 03:37:44.160]  watching the video that we posted last night right after it streamed on
[03:37:44.160 --> 03:37:47.800]  prison planet dot TV I mean it's you think it's mental illness or are they
[03:37:47.800 --> 03:37:54.440]  coming tell pro Bob now it could be both but I think a lot of it is people just
[03:37:54.440 --> 03:37:59.440]  want something for nothing but they're getting it for nothing and complaining
[03:37:59.440 --> 03:38:06.640]  that's right it people are strange and sometimes they spend the whole life
[03:38:06.640 --> 03:38:12.400]  being quote normal and then it could they get strange or vice versa well you
[03:38:12.400 --> 03:38:16.040]  today you never know what you're gonna get Bob you've said it before when
[03:38:16.040 --> 03:38:18.960]  you're number one and you've been number one in your field Ted up there number
[03:38:18.960 --> 03:38:23.120]  one his alternative media feel I've been number one for a decade and what I do
[03:38:23.120 --> 03:38:27.960]  and they're jealous they're jealous they burn within me there are and I hate
[03:38:27.960 --> 03:38:31.720]  that I want to see them be winners as well you know these little jealous
[03:38:31.720 --> 03:38:35.320]  people can never get it together because they're too busy critiquing other
[03:38:35.320 --> 03:38:41.000]  people and a lot of them don't have the equipment to and and they feel badly
[03:38:41.000 --> 03:38:47.080]  about that and but that's just the way life is some people are given gifts and
[03:38:47.080 --> 03:38:51.440]  some people aren't yeah well I shouldn't be complaining about it I just it's a
[03:38:51.440 --> 03:38:55.400]  new level when they're watching the free video and complaining are on my
[03:38:55.400 --> 03:38:58.560]  website where it's posted and complaining and I just see it they're
[03:38:58.560 --> 03:39:02.360]  like he shouldn't have a subscription site this should all be free and there
[03:39:02.360 --> 03:39:08.120]  it is it's people that subscribe to fund us so you idiots can see it for free I
[03:39:08.120 --> 03:39:12.720]  just I shouldn't even respond to it it's definitely basement dwellers eating
[03:39:12.720 --> 03:39:16.280]  hot pockets and their mother's telling them you know to carry the trash out
[03:39:16.280 --> 03:39:21.440]  when they're 35 it's just it just really gets to me sometimes because because
[03:39:21.440 --> 03:39:26.240]  because it's their critical thinking look Bob I don't think of myself as
[03:39:26.240 --> 03:39:29.880]  that smart and then the more I live the more I'm out there I start figuring out
[03:39:29.880 --> 03:39:35.240]  I'm smart compared to a lot of people people are really this dumb and I guess
[03:39:35.240 --> 03:39:39.280]  that's what the globalists are using is the fact that they know a lot of people
[03:39:39.280 --> 03:39:43.280]  are dumb down or not paying attention and they use that against them Bob and
[03:39:43.280 --> 03:39:48.400]  that's absolutely correct and that's why they think they can subdue us and
[03:39:48.400 --> 03:39:53.640]  enslave us and I get news for them there's just all kinds of people out
[03:39:53.640 --> 03:39:58.040]  there who are smarter than they are and these masses of the universe like
[03:39:58.040 --> 03:40:03.440]  Soros and there's Nitsky and Kissinger they're all going to find out they
[03:40:03.440 --> 03:40:07.960]  weren't as smart as they thought they were they're not Ted Anderson I want to
[03:40:07.960 --> 03:40:11.040]  go to Alan Tim Jeffrey Dennis and George we're gonna end this here in about 10
[03:40:11.040 --> 03:40:13.720]  minutes but I gotta get to those calls do you have any comments on what I was
[03:40:13.720 --> 03:40:17.440]  just talking about well you know that I've been in it for long enough to know
[03:40:17.440 --> 03:40:21.080]  too that there are people out out there that expects something for nothing and
[03:40:21.080 --> 03:40:25.240]  and really that's what they're contributing is nothing and if you want
[03:40:25.240 --> 03:40:29.680]  to save your country people gave their blood and their lives for this it's a
[03:40:29.680 --> 03:40:34.120]  fight for our lives and a freedom and our liberty and that means you have to
[03:40:34.120 --> 03:40:37.480]  give up something my goodness of course they should finance and they should be
[03:40:37.480 --> 03:40:41.640]  behind you 100% and I see those comments I mean that's just anytime there's a
[03:40:41.640 --> 03:40:44.520]  internet billboard people think they can just put up a whole bunch of
[03:40:44.520 --> 03:40:48.520]  profanity and talk about how bad people are that that's that's just well what it
[03:40:48.520 --> 03:40:52.760]  is is it's losers that that one up themselves so I can talk bad about the
[03:40:52.760 --> 03:40:56.240]  you know the person who's in the arena and it's like it's like Teddy Roosevelt
[03:40:56.240 --> 03:40:59.640]  said it doesn't matter guys we pull up the Teddy Roosevelt quote about in
[03:40:59.640 --> 03:41:03.280]  the arena just Teddy Roosevelt arena quote but he basically said it isn't the
[03:41:03.280 --> 03:41:07.080]  critic that matters it's those that are in the arena and I know the vast majority
[03:41:07.080 --> 03:41:11.400]  are great wonderful people it doesn't even hurt me that I get attacked it hurts
[03:41:11.400 --> 03:41:18.560]  me that they're they're so servile and petty and worm-like I feel bad for them
[03:41:18.560 --> 03:41:23.960]  I mean it literally just just blows my mind that they here it is
[03:41:23.960 --> 03:41:29.720]  crystallized they're not mad at the IRS literally taking old people's houses and
[03:41:29.720 --> 03:41:33.440]  grabbing wedding rings off women's fingers they're not mad at the big
[03:41:33.440 --> 03:41:37.880]  bankers and Warren Buffett destroying their own stock and not letting their
[03:41:37.880 --> 03:41:41.160]  folks know and getting banker bailout while calling for higher taxes on the
[03:41:41.160 --> 03:41:44.760]  middle class so they can steal the money they're not mad at Bill Gates calling to
[03:41:44.760 --> 03:41:48.680]  basically sterilize everybody and kill grandma with the death care the death
[03:41:48.680 --> 03:41:52.040]  panels they're not mad at the TSA sticking their hands on their pants
[03:41:52.040 --> 03:41:57.400]  they're mad at those of us that are trying to rally people to stop evil
[03:41:57.400 --> 03:42:01.760]  even if you're jealous of us because we're real men we have red blood we're
[03:42:01.760 --> 03:42:06.680]  not scared we're public we don't use fake handles and fake names that upset
[03:42:06.680 --> 03:42:10.680]  you as cowards I understand that but but at least you should want self
[03:42:10.680 --> 03:42:14.840]  preservation and get out of the way so real men can go out and reach out to
[03:42:14.840 --> 03:42:18.320]  other real men and women that want freedom you know I said it before get
[03:42:18.320 --> 03:42:22.560]  out of the road get out of the way get out of my way get out of my way get out
[03:42:22.560 --> 03:42:27.440]  of my way I'm tired of the pessimism and people that try to kill the messenger
[03:42:27.440 --> 03:42:31.240]  and and who don't understand this is life and death final comment Bob on that
[03:42:31.240 --> 03:42:34.920]  and we're gonna rampage through calls you've covered it all let's go to the
[03:42:34.920 --> 03:42:38.960]  calls all right here's the man in the arena thing and we'll go to the calls
[03:42:38.960 --> 03:42:42.840]  the man in the arena it is not the critic who counts not the man who points
[03:42:42.840 --> 03:42:46.600]  out how the strong man stumbles or where the doer of deeds could have done them
[03:42:46.600 --> 03:42:51.240]  better the credit belongs the man who is actually in the arena whose face is
[03:42:51.240 --> 03:42:56.160]  marred by dust and sweat and blood who strives valiantly who errs who errors
[03:42:56.160 --> 03:43:01.080]  and who comes short again and again because there is no effort without error
[03:43:01.080 --> 03:43:06.400]  and shortcoming but who does actually strive to do the deeds who knows great
[03:43:06.400 --> 03:43:10.880]  enthusiasm's the great devotions who spends himself in a worthy cause who is
[03:43:10.880 --> 03:43:15.320]  it best knows in the end the triumph of high achievement and at the worst if he
[03:43:15.320 --> 03:43:19.760]  fails at least fails while daring greatly so that his place shall never be
[03:43:19.760 --> 03:43:24.560]  with those cold and timid souls who neither know victory nor defeat let's
[03:43:24.560 --> 03:43:30.360]  go to your calls Allen in Florida you're on the air go ahead hi Alex my name is
[03:43:30.360 --> 03:43:33.520]  Allen I'm in Florida I was actually calling so I try to get in touch with you
[03:43:33.520 --> 03:43:37.520]  several times but kind of hard to get through sometimes I was calling because
[03:43:37.520 --> 03:43:42.680]  I was wondering how come you never had Jock Fresco on your show considering all
[03:43:42.680 --> 03:43:46.360]  the problems that we've been having seems to revolve around the monetary
[03:43:46.360 --> 03:43:52.520]  system one of the good solutions that could come to fix things would be to do
[03:43:52.520 --> 03:43:56.960]  away with the monetary system and switch to a resource-based economy now there
[03:43:56.960 --> 03:44:00.280]  are a lot of things on both sides okay well let me stop you let me stop you let
[03:44:00.280 --> 03:44:04.160]  me stop you I was just on YouTube during the break and saw the comments that I
[03:44:04.160 --> 03:44:08.440]  was talking about saying why hasn't Alex talked about the guy beaten to death by
[03:44:08.440 --> 03:44:11.640]  cops because it's not in the video they're watching I've talked about it
[03:44:11.640 --> 03:44:18.040]  20 times the last couple weeks I've tried to get Jock Fresco on from Florida
[03:44:18.040 --> 03:44:21.720]  repeatedly I've called his Imperial Highness as he draws pictures of the
[03:44:21.720 --> 03:44:24.840]  floating cities that are going to save us in the big brain computer that will
[03:44:24.840 --> 03:44:28.920]  decide and I'll be sent for reeducation the rest of it to actually give us
[03:44:28.920 --> 03:44:32.880]  their side of it so I can understand what he's talking about and then you call
[03:44:32.880 --> 03:44:36.760]  in and I could hear your voice you know kind of trimulating putting me on the
[03:44:36.760 --> 03:44:41.840]  spot for not getting him on why haven't I had Methuselah on because I can't get
[03:44:41.840 --> 03:44:46.760]  him on so if you can get Mr. Fresco on we'll have him on to do the simple thing
[03:44:46.760 --> 03:44:50.440]  of get rid of the monetary system all together and we'll all just be fine
[03:44:50.440 --> 03:44:53.960]  because the big mega computer is gonna run it all is that what you're saying
[03:44:53.960 --> 03:44:58.440]  it should necessarily be the mega computer that runs it but if you actually
[03:44:58.440 --> 03:45:02.280]  go into this research given I don't want to go live in the sports stadium with
[03:45:02.280 --> 03:45:07.200]  people no no it's not a sports team everybody has their own home that's all
[03:45:07.200 --> 03:45:11.440]  covered in all of his research believe me I've read it I've read it and is
[03:45:11.440 --> 03:45:15.440]  frighteningly authoritarian now I don't think everybody involved that it's bad
[03:45:15.440 --> 03:45:20.160]  and I'd like to learn more and he's got an open invitation and listen I called
[03:45:20.160 --> 03:45:26.240]  up I called up who's the Peter Joseph guy and I said hey I don't want to fight
[03:45:26.240 --> 03:45:29.280]  with you about two three months ago I said why don't you come on he said oh
[03:45:29.280 --> 03:45:31.800]  come on then he sent me a big thing well you've got to say this was wrong that
[03:45:31.800 --> 03:45:34.800]  was wrong this was wrong so I went and looked at what they've actually said and
[03:45:34.800 --> 03:45:38.760]  not and it was actually what they're saying a lot of it and he did say on
[03:45:38.760 --> 03:45:41.360]  the show that I would be sent for reeducation and I said that sounds like
[03:45:41.360 --> 03:45:44.960]  authoritarianism and he said well you have to retract that that was said and I
[03:45:44.960 --> 03:45:50.760]  said I can't retract something that was said so I mean here's the thing I don't
[03:45:50.760 --> 03:45:53.760]  want to fight with all the zeitgeist people and I think there are some good
[03:45:53.760 --> 03:45:57.000]  ideas within it but I'm not like a heretic who has to be burned at the
[03:45:57.000 --> 03:46:02.120]  stake if I don't go for it but Alan I appreciate your call what's your view on
[03:46:02.120 --> 03:46:06.200]  the zeitgeist movement of Bob Chapman or do you even know about it I've never
[03:46:06.200 --> 03:46:09.920]  heard of it yeah I mean I tried to put it all a branch out but I mean just
[03:46:09.920 --> 03:46:15.000]  people just like saying you know oh it's great we'll get rid of this monetary
[03:46:15.000 --> 03:46:19.200]  system great get rid of it but then I don't want to be under this this all
[03:46:19.200 --> 03:46:23.680]  powerful central system see I don't I want to be free I mean you may have a
[03:46:23.680 --> 03:46:27.880]  better system I want to go out and be a caveman okay I just I don't want to be
[03:46:27.880 --> 03:46:31.680]  domesticated even though you guys have got a great idea and I've got to live
[03:46:31.680 --> 03:46:35.140]  under it and I'd love to hear about it and try to be friendly about it but it's
[03:46:35.140 --> 03:46:39.480]  not like okay let's go to Tim and Michigan Tim you're on the air we got
[03:46:39.480 --> 03:46:43.640]  to move quick now go ahead Tim all right Alex how you doing today buddy good
[03:46:43.640 --> 03:46:46.640]  this is the guy that came up with the idea of the Google bomb go ahead yeah
[03:46:46.640 --> 03:46:50.160]  thank you man thank you I appreciate I heard you say that the other day on your
[03:46:50.160 --> 03:46:53.640]  show I appreciate it we got to move quick because I waited and didn't go to calls
[03:46:53.640 --> 03:46:59.040]  okay um you mentioned one time something about you know we got to change
[03:46:59.040 --> 03:47:05.040]  this mass media term to something else well I decided then to rename it the
[03:47:05.040 --> 03:47:10.440]  magic news media because all they really are is a bunch of illusionist the
[03:47:10.440 --> 03:47:15.400]  question for Bob I have is because somebody did bring up what I call the
[03:47:15.400 --> 03:47:21.880]  bin Laden show and the second part of that question involves the birth
[03:47:21.880 --> 03:47:28.440]  certificate my question is do you think that these two situations were simply
[03:47:28.440 --> 03:47:34.840]  a way to revitalize Obama's popularity rating yes go ahead Bob thank you Tim
[03:47:34.840 --> 03:47:40.920]  yes they were there's nothing that they do that by chance there's no coincidence
[03:47:40.920 --> 03:47:45.720]  everything is well planned out they have people doing that and yes you're you're
[03:47:45.720 --> 03:47:51.560]  correct Jeremy and Indiana you're on the air with Bob and Ted go ahead Alex Bob
[03:47:51.560 --> 03:47:54.400]  and I just want to let you know I'm here in Newton County Indiana I was a
[03:47:54.400 --> 03:47:58.600]  champion of the Constitution that ran against Sheriff Hitler Hartman here and
[03:47:58.600 --> 03:48:02.720]  I just wanted you know we've heard yours Alex but I'd like to hear Bob Chapman's
[03:48:02.720 --> 03:48:09.960]  war cry knowing his background how's that Bob he wants you to do the enemy well
[03:48:09.960 --> 03:48:16.520]  I think I'm a little low for that but when I was coaching kids and soccer they
[03:48:16.520 --> 03:48:22.680]  always wanted a war cry so I made one up for them and I it's called Kakalaka if
[03:48:22.680 --> 03:48:34.080]  you can remember that that's the war cry of the little kids in soccer
[03:48:34.080 --> 03:48:40.920]  oh my god okay anything else Jeremy in Indiana I just wanted to run down the
[03:48:40.920 --> 03:48:44.720]  last year a couple headlines here in Newton County we just kept it tough the
[03:48:44.720 --> 03:48:49.200]  tip of the iceberg there rock tan hannahford commissioner charged with
[03:48:49.200 --> 03:48:53.440]  profiting from the sale of a child swept under the carpet Edward J. bars five
[03:48:53.440 --> 03:48:57.680]  years unlawful practice of law he was a county prosecutor swept under the carpet
[03:48:57.680 --> 03:49:01.800]  Jeff Kerinsky bar room brawl a month before his election swept under the
[03:49:01.800 --> 03:49:07.760]  carpet look I gotta stop you right there yes more and more the criminals
[03:49:07.760 --> 03:49:10.920]  have taken over every local government position and we're in deep trouble the
[03:49:10.920 --> 03:49:14.640]  police openly in Texas in many towns pull over old women and rob their
[03:49:14.640 --> 03:49:18.080]  purse and say you don't have proof of this cash even if you have the print
[03:49:18.080 --> 03:49:22.800]  out receipt Bobby I mean it just gets crazier and crazier doesn't it it is
[03:49:22.800 --> 03:49:29.760]  awful it is awful and I've seen some videos the cops saying terrible things
[03:49:29.760 --> 03:49:34.480]  to people and that they're gonna kill them too yeah oh that one in Ohio where
[03:49:34.480 --> 03:49:38.720]  the guy has a concealed carry so the cop tells him how to kill you for like 10
[03:49:38.720 --> 03:49:45.160]  minutes unbelievable and I don't know whether finding them I'll be honest with
[03:49:45.160 --> 03:49:48.440]  you I mean I mean that guy I'm surprised that while that cops saying I'm gonna
[03:49:48.440 --> 03:49:51.480]  kill you I'm gonna murder you the guy didn't defend himself I mean you got a
[03:49:51.480 --> 03:49:54.960]  deranged lunatic they pull you over I got a concealed carry get out of there
[03:49:54.960 --> 03:49:59.000]  I'm gonna blow your head off I mean it's like they think they're God or
[03:49:59.000 --> 03:50:04.360]  something that's right and it's not all of them that's just a small percentage
[03:50:04.360 --> 03:50:08.920]  but it makes it bad for all of the law enforcement and they're there to help us
[03:50:08.920 --> 03:50:17.480]  and some of them aren't there mentally deranged I tell you it is or they're
[03:50:17.480 --> 03:50:21.080]  like kids that grew up watching wrestling and think it's real like the cops for
[03:50:21.080 --> 03:50:25.800]  five minutes did drop drop knees into this guy's head for no reason while he
[03:50:25.800 --> 03:50:29.680]  was unconscious I mean and and and then killed him I'm of course you're
[03:50:29.680 --> 03:50:33.280]  killing you morons I mean you can kill somebody with one punch you hit him
[03:50:33.280 --> 03:50:40.160]  right and it's just incredibly it's like them trying to show off that that they
[03:50:40.160 --> 03:50:44.480]  bagged a turkey or something it's like they're hunting us Bob I look forward to
