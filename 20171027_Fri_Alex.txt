[00:00:25.063 --> 00:00:31.545]  From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[00:00:31.545 --> 00:00:37.006]  What we are looking at is good and evil, right and wrong.
[00:00:37.006 --> 00:00:48.269]  Alright, last Friday we broke the news that President Trump told Roger Stone and others that barring any new information he was going to release the JFK files by Thursday night.
[00:00:48.269 --> 00:00:49.550]  He released about 95% of it, but 300 files
[00:00:54.654 --> 00:00:57.016]  Roughly, we're kept back.
[00:00:57.016 --> 00:00:59.398]  And that just adds to everybody's concern.
[00:01:00.632 --> 00:01:09.739]  We're getting information from Gorka and others with connections to the White House that they really fought Trump on this, the Deep State did, and basically refused to do it.
[00:01:09.739 --> 00:01:28.594]  And we know there's been an ongoing rebellion in government, and so the President tweeted out after this happened, and after the media spun it, that he'd lied to the public, saying he'd release everything, saying no, they've put it into some committee for review the next six months, and I think that all of it will get released, hopefully.
[00:01:29.718 --> 00:01:32.119]  But this is an example of how they're bucking the president.
[00:01:32.119 --> 00:01:32.920]  There it is.
[00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:36.102]  JFK files are being carefully released.
[00:01:36.102 --> 00:01:39.204]  In the end, there will be great transparency.
[00:01:39.204 --> 00:01:43.966]  It's my hope to just get about everything out of the public.
[00:01:43.966 --> 00:01:48.089]  Again, it's my hope to get just about everything out of the public.
[00:01:48.089 --> 00:01:51.451]  That's what he tweeted this morning.
[00:01:51.451 --> 00:01:53.292]  Roger Stone's joining us in the next segment.
[00:01:53.292 --> 00:01:56.554]  He obviously has a lot of intel on that, and so do I.
[00:01:58.052 --> 00:02:10.362]  I have been talking at length with one of the only White House sources left, and I'm just going to leave it at that, and obviously our phones are all tapped by Deep State, and so has Roger.
[00:02:10.362 --> 00:02:18.168]  Roger's been talking to other very big heavy hitters, including the President, obviously.
[00:02:18.168 --> 00:02:23.512]  And separate from the JFK stuff we'll cover in the next segment,
[00:02:25.993 --> 00:02:39.144]  The info I've got so important and so big, I'm not ready to put it out on air because I need to really look at every angle of it.
[00:02:39.144 --> 00:02:46.350]  But just for everybody's safety, I think I'm gonna have to go ahead and put it out on the air today.
[00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:51.635]  And then there's a whole other subject.
[00:02:51.635 --> 00:02:52.415]  I'm gonna leave it at that.
[00:02:53.988 --> 00:02:56.089]  I just am speechless at this point.
[00:02:56.089 --> 00:03:09.476]  Because, believe me, an entire FBI office wouldn't know what to do in a few hours with just one of these issues I've got.
[00:03:21.405 --> 00:03:43.318]  And by that I mean these are such big complex things and we have so much credibility with people that actually are involved in and out of the government that we get this intel just continually that is just bombshell.
[00:03:43.318 --> 00:03:48.321]  And I'm just asking myself how do I present all this properly when
[00:03:52.739 --> 00:03:56.562]  Say News is like trying to bail out a boat that's got a leak in it.
[00:03:56.562 --> 00:04:03.607]  And I'm trying to bail it out with a teacup and it's just, water's just pouring in.
[00:04:03.607 --> 00:04:08.591]  The news is all completely over-the-top insane.
[00:04:08.591 --> 00:04:17.458]  There is a national blackout martial law drill
[00:04:18.999 --> 00:04:32.184]  set to take place throughout October, late October into November, simulating martial law if the left blows up the power plants or the Transformers.
[00:04:32.184 --> 00:04:34.085]  We know they've been training for that.
[00:04:34.085 --> 00:04:35.306]  I had that info months ago.
[00:04:35.306 --> 00:04:36.966]  I didn't go public with it on air.
[00:04:36.966 --> 00:04:38.027]  But now it's in the news.
[00:04:38.027 --> 00:04:40.368]  I mean, there's just big stuff coming.
[00:04:40.368 --> 00:04:42.249]  There's a civil war in this country.
[00:04:42.249 --> 00:04:45.310]  The globalists don't tend to turn loose about a fight.
[00:04:45.310 --> 00:04:45.710]  Stay with us.
[00:04:45.710 --> 00:04:48.131]  I'm gonna try to figure out how to present all this, but this is really important.
[00:04:59.881 --> 00:05:07.066]  This week, the FBI released over 1,500 heavily redacted documents concerning the Sandy Hook investigation.
[00:05:07.066 --> 00:05:14.410]  In many cases, entire pages are redacted, but unredacted portions of the Sandy Hook documents continue to support the narrative.
[00:05:14.410 --> 00:05:21.995]  20-year-old shooter Adam Lanza was a lonely, tech-savvy high school dropout, an experienced shooter with an interest in weapons.
[00:05:22.295 --> 00:05:28.178]  A functioning autistic with a personality disorder and a recluse who liked to play video games all day.
[00:05:28.178 --> 00:05:30.760]  But there's one key update on page 41.
[00:05:30.760 --> 00:05:40.885]  A source told agents that Lanza, while in the 9th grade, was visited at his home by either CIA or FBI agents after hacking a government computer system.
[00:05:40.885 --> 00:05:47.009]  The source said authorities told Nancy Lanza that if her son was that smart, he could have a job with them someday.
[00:05:47.469 --> 00:05:49.512]  InfoWars has the documents!
[00:05:49.512 --> 00:05:50.333]  Read them right now.
[00:05:50.333 --> 00:05:57.544]  They're posted in their entirety at the article, FBI releases heavily redacted Sandy Hook investigation docs.
[00:05:57.544 --> 00:05:59.527]  Leanne McAdoo, InfoWars.com
[00:06:18.152 --> 00:06:19.834]  You want to stop tyranny?
[00:06:19.834 --> 00:06:21.496]  Well, so does he.
[00:06:21.496 --> 00:06:28.865]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[00:06:28.865 --> 00:06:31.048]  America is awakening.
[00:06:31.048 --> 00:06:33.070]  So is the rest of the world.
[00:06:33.070 --> 00:06:34.873]  But the globalists are pushing back.
[00:06:36.365 --> 00:06:42.630]  I'm gonna get to this later, not because it's about me, but because it's a total lie, and it's the anatomy of how they engage in frauds.
[00:06:42.630 --> 00:06:52.599]  Raw Story, Newsweek, and others haven't known how to respond the last month, us being the cutting-edge folks breaking the main news about the official narrative of Vegas being false.
[00:06:52.599 --> 00:07:01.166]  So their new thing is to say that I say that nobody died there, and that I am attacking the victims through my listeners.
[00:07:01.166 --> 00:07:01.787]  Total bull!
[00:07:02.978 --> 00:07:08.421]  But that's Raw Story, that's Newsweek, and that's just how they operate.
[00:07:08.421 --> 00:07:09.742]  So that's coming up.
[00:07:09.742 --> 00:07:25.471]  Speaking of Vegas, either today or tomorrow, we're looking to break the most hardcore smoking gun information about Vegas yet.
[00:07:25.471 --> 00:07:26.552]  And I'll just leave it at that.
[00:07:28.732 --> 00:07:30.974]  Obviously, we are a big media outlet.
[00:07:30.974 --> 00:07:32.135]  People know we're independent.
[00:07:32.135 --> 00:07:37.638]  They know we're fearless to the point of being pretty much crazy.
[00:07:37.638 --> 00:07:49.445]  And I'll have to process this information today because it's been on our plate since about 11 o'clock last night.
[00:07:49.445 --> 00:07:54.388]  And then we're going to cover it once I decide what to do.
[00:07:54.388 --> 00:07:55.289]  And I'm not complaining.
[00:07:55.289 --> 00:07:56.770]  I just wish there was more time.
[00:07:58.223 --> 00:08:08.689]  Because I've got five different bombshell stories that we're right in the middle of that I know are key.
[00:08:08.689 --> 00:08:17.573]  We've got this martial law drill simulating the left knocking out the power grid.
[00:08:17.573 --> 00:08:21.616]  They can't turn off the coal power systems and they can't sabotage the economy.
[00:08:21.616 --> 00:08:23.677]  I mean, that's what they're talking about doing.
[00:08:23.677 --> 00:08:27.459]  And I didn't even get into this a month ago, a month and a half ago, when I learned about it from
[00:08:29.793 --> 00:08:50.345]  Let's just say the shadow government or the folks that actually deal with it on the ground, the military that's assigned to the FBI and assigned to these task forces, they have picked up coordinated drilling going on all over the country with the left planning to attack the power grid in November.
[00:08:50.345 --> 00:08:53.347]  And I didn't put this on air because I don't want to give their own people ideas.
[00:08:53.347 --> 00:08:54.248]  It's in the news today.
[00:08:56.260 --> 00:08:58.582]  They're going to simulate national power outages.
[00:08:58.582 --> 00:09:01.445]  We're going to Roger Stone here in just a moment.
[00:09:01.445 --> 00:09:06.810]  We've got Mattis basically signaling they're preparing to use nuclear weapons on the DMZ, as I told you they'll have to.
[00:09:06.810 --> 00:09:12.615]  There's 100,000 pieces of artillery there aimed at Seoul, so it's the only tactic.
[00:09:12.615 --> 00:09:16.039]  And the head of the South Korean defense
[00:09:17.389 --> 00:09:17.609]  That's
[00:09:42.128 --> 00:09:53.930]  There's a lot of news breaking on the Kennedy assassination today with the KGB files coming out that they believed Lyndon Johnson killed President Kennedy and was planting a false flag to blame Russia.
[00:09:53.930 --> 00:09:58.952]  We know part of that's true because Operation Northwoods was a similar plan killed by Kennedy.
[00:09:58.952 --> 00:10:06.373]  We also have British newspaper received mystery call minutes before JFK assassination telling him it was going to happen.
[00:10:06.373 --> 00:10:07.633]  We've got all that.
[00:10:07.633 --> 00:10:10.474]  But joining us is Roger Stone for the next few segments.
[00:10:11.923 --> 00:10:20.086]  To discuss from his sources, and by the way, we predicted this, not just last Friday, but Sunday and Monday, we said, we think they're gonna black out a bunch of it.
[00:10:20.086 --> 00:10:25.889]  The president can order it released, but they've already blacked most of it out.
[00:10:25.889 --> 00:10:26.829]  They've done this before.
[00:10:26.829 --> 00:10:36.774]  Well, instead of doing that, what they've done with 2,000 plus pages they've released, the 3,000, is they just held back 300 files.
[00:10:41.274 --> 00:10:43.415]  While they decide what to do.
[00:10:43.415 --> 00:10:46.135]  And they just told the president, you're violating national security if you do this.
[00:10:46.135 --> 00:10:50.276]  And the word I got is they just double-crossed him last minute and didn't put it out.
[00:10:50.276 --> 00:10:53.257]  The president doesn't want to look embarrassed.
[00:10:53.257 --> 00:11:00.579]  CNN's acting like he reneged and double-crossed everybody when he could have just done like past presidents and said, no, I'm not releasing it.
[00:11:00.579 --> 00:11:09.421]  And so you're seeing deep state quicksand from my intel basically refuse in a mutinous action to go along with the president.
[00:11:10.643 --> 00:11:15.455]  Which is, like Schirmer said, the intelligence agency can have seven ways a Sunday to get you.
[00:11:15.455 --> 00:11:17.039]  And we've been seeing them leak on him.
[00:11:17.039 --> 00:11:17.560]  He said it was...
[00:11:20.148 --> 00:11:24.770]  The FBI director that did it, and it turned out it was, and it's just a mess.
[00:11:24.770 --> 00:11:26.331]  It's a civil war going on in the country.
[00:11:26.331 --> 00:11:32.354]  We'll get Roger Stone's take on this briefly, because I want to segue into some of the big intel you've gotten.
[00:11:32.354 --> 00:11:36.817]  I don't know how much of it you can get into now, but it dovetails with mine about what's really going on in the White House.
[00:11:36.817 --> 00:11:44.661]  I know you tried to have a longer meeting with me this morning, and I had to get off the phone, so we were unable to complete our decision process on this.
[00:11:44.661 --> 00:11:46.462]  But this is really important, obviously.
[00:11:49.381 --> 00:11:53.703]  So, I've gotten overwhelmed at this point, Roger.
[00:11:53.703 --> 00:11:54.923]  Just how crazy this has gotten.
[00:11:54.923 --> 00:11:56.424]  The fog of war here.
[00:11:56.424 --> 00:11:58.825]  But you agreed with me this morning that the tide is turning.
[00:11:58.825 --> 00:12:00.385]  We've had a really good 10 days.
[00:12:00.385 --> 00:12:04.047]  The deep states, the corrupt elements of it are on the run.
[00:12:04.047 --> 00:12:12.110]  First of all, I think this is a graphic illustration of how quickly American politics and attitudes towards everything can change in just 10 days.
[00:12:13.294 --> 00:12:28.276]  Between the Uranium One bombshell that the Obama administration engaged in a cover-up of an effort by the Russians to get control of 20% of our uranium output, with big bribes to the Clintons as part of it,
[00:12:28.917 --> 00:12:38.848]  Followed by the revelations that Hillary and her people paid for the smear dossier and what you deemed PPgate, where they attempted to smear Trump.
[00:12:38.848 --> 00:12:45.054]  By the way, $3 million of your tax dollars funneled to that operation through the FBI.
[00:12:46.347 --> 00:13:04.414]  And now Trump taking a bold and I think courageous stand and releasing the documents only to have the deep state do a rear guard action where they're attempting to redact, censor, hold back as much as they possibly can.
[00:13:04.414 --> 00:13:10.096]  Essentially, countermanding the president in defying the will of the president.
[00:13:10.096 --> 00:13:14.558]  So your intel agrees with my intel and with Gorka's saying and Lou Dobbs, that's exactly what happened?
[00:13:15.523 --> 00:13:17.005]  No, there's no question.
[00:13:17.005 --> 00:13:21.632]  The guys in Langley are moving quickly to cover their assets.
[00:13:21.632 --> 00:13:23.214]  They've got to clean these up quickly.
[00:13:23.214 --> 00:13:26.519]  Why they didn't already have these redactions done?
[00:13:26.519 --> 00:13:29.804]  Why they didn't already have... Clearly they have it sitting around for blackmail purposes.
[00:13:30.509 --> 00:13:36.555]  They thought that they would bluff him and he would never allow release of these.
[00:13:36.555 --> 00:13:49.648]  As I reported at Infowars, the intelligence agencies lobbied the president that this was going to hurt them by revealing their methods, their sources, their operations.
[00:13:49.648 --> 00:13:50.469]  It's nonsense.
[00:13:51.469 --> 00:13:53.190]  They lied then, they lie now.
[00:13:53.190 --> 00:13:54.991]  That's what they don't want people to see.
[00:13:54.991 --> 00:14:02.874]  The same people who undermined John F. Kennedy and liquidated him are the people trying to take down our president.
[00:14:02.874 --> 00:14:07.577]  I want to be specific because that's even buried in the news that last minute they just said,
[00:14:08.817 --> 00:14:10.398]  Last minute, let us hold this back.
[00:14:10.398 --> 00:14:11.739]  There's not time.
[00:14:11.739 --> 00:14:13.020]  Put it to this committee.
[00:14:13.020 --> 00:14:15.582]  Six months, and just they made the decision.
[00:14:15.582 --> 00:14:17.903]  So, what's the headline on that?
[00:14:17.903 --> 00:14:25.188]  CIA, Deep State, does rearguard action, mutinies against Trump, refuses to release documents?
[00:14:25.188 --> 00:14:30.672]  Until I can, they've only put out a small portion of what they have.
[00:14:30.672 --> 00:14:34.114]  We have to review how much of it's just redacted, just blacked out.
[00:14:34.114 --> 00:14:36.216]  Lee Harvey Oswald met with black.
[00:14:36.960 --> 00:14:44.584]  At the black and they discussed in the next five paragraphs are just blacked out by the by some bureaucrat.
[00:14:44.584 --> 00:14:54.029]  It's most definitely an effort to nullify the law put in place by Congress and signed by the president to let the people know what really happened.
[00:14:54.029 --> 00:14:58.172]  And the good news Alex is that I was told they went to him and said,
[00:14:58.943 --> 00:15:01.928]  These 200 documents can never be released.
[00:15:01.928 --> 00:15:04.212]  We just don't have enough time to explain to you why.
[00:15:04.212 --> 00:15:08.319]  And he said, good, put a time clock of six months on them and we'll look at them.
[00:15:08.319 --> 00:15:13.247]  So he hasn't, he hasn't, he's attempting to keep his commitment.
[00:15:14.045 --> 00:15:20.767]  I'm certainly, uh, I am certain that no one has brought him the documents showing him the redactions.
[00:15:20.767 --> 00:15:22.768]  Uh, but he'll look into that.
[00:15:22.768 --> 00:15:34.131]  Uh, if they redacted these, if they censored them so much that they were mushed, that they were useless for historians or researchers, the president will be able to see that.
[00:15:34.131 --> 00:15:40.513]  Well, I think that's the process that's now going to happen in the next six months, where they just take each page, dip it in black ink, and that's...
[00:15:42.344 --> 00:15:47.412]  Just incredible that we're 53 years later and we already know the truth.
[00:15:47.412 --> 00:15:56.885]  When we come back, Roger, I want to get into what we were discussing earlier as much as you can because I don't think we can sit on this information dealing with what's happening inside the Trump White House.
[00:15:58.795 --> 00:16:00.676]  Fully cooked, ready-to-eat bacon.
[00:16:00.676 --> 00:16:03.918]  I'm talking thick, meaty, center-cut, presidential bacon.
[00:16:03.918 --> 00:16:05.519]  Savory and delicious.
[00:16:05.519 --> 00:16:08.341]  I buy some, I use some, I store some.
[00:16:08.341 --> 00:16:09.001]  Awesome.
[00:16:09.001 --> 00:16:12.103]  No refrigeration needed with a 10-year shelf life.

[00:20:17.816 --> 00:20:29.794]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:20:29.794 --> 00:20:31.076]  Okay.
[00:20:33.494 --> 00:20:37.337]  Some of this news we're gonna have to break in studio next week.
[00:20:37.337 --> 00:20:44.763]  I may even get Roger here this weekend because we've got to really go over this entire model of how they're planning to take out the president.
[00:20:44.763 --> 00:20:46.244]  We have the blueprint.
[00:20:46.244 --> 00:20:47.865]  Not that we've reverse-engineered.
[00:20:47.865 --> 00:20:49.626]  We have it.
[00:20:49.626 --> 00:20:51.448]  Okay, we know who the players are.
[00:20:51.448 --> 00:20:53.709]  It's gotten very clear now.
[00:20:53.709 --> 00:20:57.412]  And the exact plan and the neocons working with the Democrats and the whole deal.
[00:20:57.412 --> 00:20:59.814]  Now, it's not going well for them, but they're biding their time.
[00:21:01.860 --> 00:21:05.061]  Roger's got a huge data dump.
[00:21:05.061 --> 00:21:06.601]  And you're going to get it exclusively here.
[00:21:06.601 --> 00:21:08.941]  People say, oh, we don't care about the intrigue of the White House.
[00:21:08.941 --> 00:21:14.363]  This is the intrigue of the ship of state trying to turn the Republic around.
[00:21:14.363 --> 00:21:16.023]  And the whole world's watching this.
[00:21:16.023 --> 00:21:18.163]  And we see Catalonia declaring independence.
[00:21:18.163 --> 00:21:20.764]  Spain declared martial law.
[00:21:20.764 --> 00:21:21.484]  Federal rule.
[00:21:21.484 --> 00:21:23.724]  They're sending in federal troops.
[00:21:23.724 --> 00:21:25.905]  There's just wild stuff happening everywhere.
[00:21:27.349 --> 00:21:27.849]  D.O.D.
[00:21:27.849 --> 00:21:34.212]  plans solar storm based national blackout drill during Antifa protest in November.
[00:21:34.212 --> 00:21:38.814]  When Antifa says they're planning terror attacks, then the media spins it and says, no they're not.
[00:21:38.814 --> 00:21:42.295]  Just like when CNN says, yeah, the deep state's going to kill Trump.
[00:21:42.295 --> 00:21:44.216]  And then they say, Jones is crazy.
[00:21:44.216 --> 00:21:52.039]  His favorite conspiracy theory is that we're talking about civil war or the 25th amendment or removing Trump.
[00:21:52.039 --> 00:21:52.339]  And then they
[00:21:53.399 --> 00:21:54.420]  Next hour, they promote it.
[00:21:54.420 --> 00:22:03.485]  So it's a very weird tactic they've got, where they prepare it in public, but then say they're not doing it.
[00:22:03.485 --> 00:22:04.966]  It's a military tactic, actually.
[00:22:04.966 --> 00:22:07.007]  You know, don't run, we are your friends.
[00:22:07.007 --> 00:22:10.089]  Roger, obviously, this is huge news.
[00:22:10.089 --> 00:22:15.753]  What do you want to break now, just so folks coming up next week realize how accurate this was?
[00:22:15.753 --> 00:22:20.856]  Just like when we said months ago in April, no, the President's not going to send in
[00:22:21.856 --> 00:22:27.780]  100,000 troops into Syria and take out Damascus, even though his generals, McMaster, were saying they would on CNN.
[00:22:27.780 --> 00:22:30.642]  Three days later, the president came out and said those exact words.
[00:22:30.642 --> 00:22:37.287]  So you're about to do that yet again to let people know what's going on dealing with military activity in the White House.
[00:22:37.287 --> 00:22:37.567]  Go ahead.
[00:22:38.530 --> 00:22:42.791]  First of all, I think it's important to recognize exactly who General H.R.
[00:22:42.791 --> 00:22:44.512]  McMaster is.
[00:22:44.512 --> 00:22:59.737]  Let's remember that McMaster was put in place on the recommendation of Jared Kushner, the President's son-in-law, presumably his lovely wife Ivanka, both federal employees, members of this administration, and
[00:23:00.967 --> 00:23:10.434]  He has formerly worked for a think tank funded by the Ford Foundation, the Rockefeller Foundation, and George Soros.
[00:23:10.434 --> 00:23:13.736]  He's a member of the Council on Foreign Relations.
[00:23:13.736 --> 00:23:22.181]  He wrote a book criticizing the Johnson administration's conduct of the war, where the generals were lying to the president.
[00:23:22.181 --> 00:23:29.086]  And some have taken that to believe that he is a non-neocon, but he is neocon through and through.
[00:23:29.815 --> 00:23:39.263]  He is bolstered internally by Dina Habib-Powell, formerly of the Bush White House and working for the Senator from Texas.
[00:23:39.263 --> 00:23:43.807]  She is an ardent globalist and never a Trumper.
[00:23:43.807 --> 00:23:52.214]  And then, so McMaster is very close to both General Kelly and General Pettus.
[00:23:52.214 --> 00:23:56.177]  And this is what we call the Seven Days in May group.
[00:23:57.010 --> 00:24:00.877]  Uh, and they are without any question neocons.
[00:24:00.877 --> 00:24:08.713]  Let's remember that all three of them wanted to send 150,000 troops to Syria right after the president, uh,
[00:24:09.489 --> 00:24:11.971]  Uh, ordered a strategic bombing there.
[00:24:11.971 --> 00:24:19.956]  And you'll remember that the president very wisely narrowed the assault down so it would have some military value.
[00:24:19.956 --> 00:24:29.782]  And also to send a little message to the Chinese and the North Koreans and the Iranians that Donald Trump is not the cream puff that Obama was.
[00:24:30.795 --> 00:24:33.136]  And I think they got the message loud and clear.
[00:24:33.136 --> 00:24:39.278]  But even then, he's not, he doesn't want to go intervene in these places ineffectively.
[00:24:39.278 --> 00:24:45.199]  And the President wisely said to their recommendation of 150,000 troops, not happening.
[00:24:45.199 --> 00:24:53.142]  In any event, I have learned, and you'll remember that the President announced that we would continue our engagement in McMaster.
[00:24:53.142 --> 00:24:56.143]  But he would not, he would not
[00:24:58.394 --> 00:25:01.135]  I'd be willing to say a number.
[00:25:01.135 --> 00:25:03.436]  He dropped the number 9,000.
[00:25:03.436 --> 00:25:08.538]  What he gave was Pettis the authority to send more than 9,000.
[00:25:08.538 --> 00:25:15.720]  And then recently McMaster essentially gave the president a decision memo on 50,000 troops.
[00:25:15.720 --> 00:25:19.321]  Alex, that would be our largest troop allotment ever to Afghanistan.
[00:25:19.321 --> 00:25:24.083]  So rather than withdrawing, we'd be expanding, inconsistent with Trumpism.
[00:25:24.711 --> 00:25:27.293]  And I'm told the president looked at it and said, what's this?
[00:25:27.293 --> 00:25:32.798]  And he said, well, that's the number of troops we need for Afghanistan.
[00:25:32.798 --> 00:25:36.201]  And the president said, we need to have a meeting on this.
[00:25:36.201 --> 00:25:37.662]  We need to have a meeting on this.
[00:25:37.662 --> 00:25:38.523]  And he wouldn't sign it.
[00:25:39.261 --> 00:25:42.782]  So, I mean, this is the kind of trickery.
[00:25:42.782 --> 00:25:47.744]  I assume McMaster thought he could finesse the President.
[00:25:47.744 --> 00:25:52.226]  This is the way the neocons infect the Trump White House.
[00:25:52.226 --> 00:25:57.787]  By the way, this is just bombshell because we broke three days before the President, word for word, said, I'm pushing back.
[00:25:57.787 --> 00:25:59.228]  We're not invading Damascus.
[00:25:59.228 --> 00:26:01.769]  Hillary and Obama started that war.
[00:26:02.569 --> 00:26:03.469]  We're on the wrong side.
[00:26:03.469 --> 00:26:04.849]  We're taking on ISIS.
[00:26:04.849 --> 00:26:07.350]  We broke that because obviously it came around from the President.
[00:26:07.350 --> 00:26:13.031]  Now you're giving people the intel of what they tried to slip past him dealing with Afghanistan.
[00:26:13.031 --> 00:26:13.651]  Recap that.
[00:26:13.651 --> 00:26:15.331]  That's so important.
[00:26:15.331 --> 00:26:19.992]  The President announced he was going to allow us to keep troops in Afghanistan.
[00:26:19.992 --> 00:26:23.213]  He would let General Pez decide how many.
[00:26:23.213 --> 00:26:24.973]  They hinted that it was around 9,000.
[00:26:24.973 --> 00:26:27.833]  Then suddenly we have H.R.
[00:26:27.833 --> 00:26:31.154]  McMaster giving the President the document authorizing 50,000 troops.
[00:26:32.501 --> 00:26:35.122]  Obviously, no one had ever mentioned this to the president.
[00:26:35.122 --> 00:26:38.843]  Obviously, he understands it's too large an engagement.
[00:26:38.843 --> 00:26:40.623]  We're supposed to be winding down there.
[00:26:40.623 --> 00:26:42.004]  We're winding up.
[00:26:42.004 --> 00:26:44.264]  And their argument is this.
[00:26:44.264 --> 00:26:48.726]  Mr. President, when we leave, everything will collapse.
[00:26:48.726 --> 00:26:49.366]  It will all go to
[00:26:51.317 --> 00:26:56.024]  And the problem is that will happen whether we leave tomorrow or we leave 15 years from now.
[00:26:56.024 --> 00:26:58.067]  What they're trying to do here won't work.
[00:26:58.067 --> 00:27:01.031]  And this is the sleight of hand of the neocons.
[00:27:01.031 --> 00:27:02.353]  And give people the date on this.
[00:27:02.353 --> 00:27:05.097]  I mean, the time from when did this just happen?
[00:27:05.097 --> 00:27:07.821]  This was within the last 10 days, I am told.
[00:27:08.939 --> 00:27:13.423]  The intrigue here in the Trump White House is extraordinary.
[00:27:13.423 --> 00:27:19.007]  They're like trying to get their parents to sign the report card, kind of slipping it over to them when they're reading the newspaper and not paying attention.
[00:27:19.007 --> 00:27:21.589]  That's the level of just grasping and grabbing.
[00:27:21.589 --> 00:27:23.590]  Let me give you some intel.
[00:27:23.590 --> 00:27:29.075]  They have these CIF teams that are CIA folks.
[00:27:29.855 --> 00:27:50.504]  With Green Berets and others that have been taken and put into private contractor positions and they're going around hunter-killer teams and of course that was in the news this week but specifically it is Eric Prince's plan but integrated with the Pentagon's plan because the Pentagon as you know wants tens of thousands more regular troops
[00:27:52.004 --> 00:28:05.870]  And so now, I guess Trump didn't want people to know the real plan, but they are launching the operations with the paramilitary forces, and so the CIA is running big teams inside the country.
[00:28:05.870 --> 00:28:07.130]  Unbelievable.
[00:28:07.130 --> 00:28:10.311]  Unbelievable.
[00:28:10.311 --> 00:28:12.852]  So what do you make of all this?
[00:28:12.852 --> 00:28:16.414]  Let me take a Marco Rubio moment.
[00:28:16.414 --> 00:28:19.395]  Yes, you've got laryngitis right now from talking 20 hours a day.
[00:28:20.151 --> 00:28:33.015]  I'm really starting to lose my voice because I have been working with the media to try to understand what's transpired here in the deep state effort to undermine the president's order for full disclosure.
[00:28:33.015 --> 00:28:34.415]  This is just incredible.
[00:28:34.415 --> 00:28:37.296]  Stay there and do a few more minutes and I'll let you go because of your voice.
[00:28:37.296 --> 00:28:42.838]  I want to look at the negatives that are here but also the positives that we're winning intellectually and the country's coming back economically.
[00:28:43.778 --> 00:28:46.821]  This could be a recovery that's killing the crib.
[00:28:46.821 --> 00:28:50.024]  So the fight is at a key moment right now.
[00:28:50.024 --> 00:28:53.347]  We've got to stay focused and hold steady and move forward.
[00:28:53.347 --> 00:28:54.268]  I'm Alex Jones.

[00:32:25.163 --> 00:32:33.608]  I'm going to have to stop this special within a week because it is blasting out of our warehouse because the fans of it already are stocking up.
[00:32:33.608 --> 00:32:35.349]  They know how great it is.

[00:32:52.598 --> 00:32:55.859]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:33:13.381 --> 00:33:28.110]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones!
[00:33:37.216 --> 00:33:54.261]  To really show you how fluid this is, last Friday the media said that Roger Stone and I were wrong and that the president was not going to release any of the JFK files that were set to be released the next Thursday evening at midnight going into Friday morning.
[00:33:54.261 --> 00:34:01.563]  And the next morning the president tweeted exactly what we'd said, what he told Roger, that barring new information he was looking at releasing them.
[00:34:02.679 --> 00:34:04.760]  And then last minute, he says, yeah, they're coming out today.
[00:34:04.760 --> 00:34:06.421]  And they go, oh, we can't.
[00:34:06.421 --> 00:34:07.421]  There's other stuff we found.
[00:34:07.421 --> 00:34:09.842]  He goes, OK, you got six months.
[00:34:09.842 --> 00:34:15.064]  But they just did that as one more time.
[00:34:15.064 --> 00:34:18.345]  And the president is about secrecy with military stuff, which is a smart thing to do.
[00:34:18.345 --> 00:34:20.386]  You don't want to tell your enemies what you're going to do.
[00:34:20.386 --> 00:34:21.867]  But this is 53 years ago.
[00:34:21.867 --> 00:34:26.549]  Ninety one percent of the American people in Gallup polls believe there are multiple shooters.
[00:34:28.228 --> 00:34:29.689]  Anyone that's serious knows that.
[00:34:29.689 --> 00:34:32.551]  We even know what happened with JFK.
[00:34:32.551 --> 00:34:33.912]  And so that's why this is so important.
[00:34:33.912 --> 00:34:36.673]  I want to play this clip and then go back to Roger Stone.
[00:34:36.673 --> 00:34:45.879]  This is Gorka, who recently left the White House, one of the President's top advisors, says, Deep State withholding of JFK files stinks to high heaven.
[00:34:45.879 --> 00:34:52.764]  And we've also got other clips here, again, where Lou Dobbs and others are saying this is outrageous.
[00:34:52.764 --> 00:34:53.104]  Here it is.
[00:34:54.181 --> 00:35:03.094]  Joining us tonight, former strategist, deputy assistant to President Trump, now the chief strategist for the Make America Great Again coalition, Dr. Sebastian Gorka.
[00:35:03.094 --> 00:35:04.136]  Great to have you here.
[00:35:04.136 --> 00:35:04.697]  Thanks for having me, Louie.
[00:35:04.697 --> 00:35:07.360]  It is quite a day in Washington, D.C.
[00:35:07.360 --> 00:35:08.041]  Right.
[00:35:08.041 --> 00:35:08.883]  Let's start with
[00:35:10.104 --> 00:35:16.390]  The obvious, and that is the delay of these documents, which the President told us that we were going to have today.
[00:35:16.390 --> 00:35:23.656]  The law says we must have by midnight today, tonight, but which we will not have.
[00:35:23.656 --> 00:35:33.785]  Instead, only about 2,500 of 35,000 overall documents, some of which have been under seal for 50, imagine this, 54 years!
[00:35:33.785 --> 00:35:34.005]  Right.
[00:35:36.507 --> 00:35:40.448]  First things first, let's dispense with the fake news.
[00:35:40.448 --> 00:35:46.830]  I was reading the Daily Mail on the way here that said, President Trump, new cover-up with JFK documents.
[00:35:46.830 --> 00:35:49.130]  This has nothing to do with President Trump.
[00:35:49.130 --> 00:35:55.312]  This is the FBI and the CIA requesting to be able to redact some of the documents.
[00:35:55.312 --> 00:35:55.852]  The hell with them!
[00:35:57.333 --> 00:36:00.256]  I mean that seriously.
[00:36:00.256 --> 00:36:11.747]  Why should we, our president, any administration put up with two agencies that over the course of what would be now 25 years since some of these documents were sealed,
[00:36:12.708 --> 00:36:14.869]  They've had 25 years to do the right thing.
[00:36:14.869 --> 00:36:18.610]  Cover assets, change methods.
[00:36:18.610 --> 00:36:22.911]  There's only two reasons that you would do that redaction right now.
[00:36:22.911 --> 00:36:28.273]  The reasons are you protect active operations or you protect sources and methods.
[00:36:28.273 --> 00:36:30.434]  Neither of those can be true 50 years later.
[00:36:30.434 --> 00:36:31.134]  So what is it?
[00:36:31.134 --> 00:36:32.614]  Something embarrassing.
[00:36:32.614 --> 00:36:39.396]  And we have seen in the last eight years the rank politicization of both the Bureau and the CIA under Brennan.
[00:36:39.396 --> 00:36:40.897]  So it really stinks to high heaven.
[00:36:41.477 --> 00:36:46.318]  And again, I don't want to toot our horn here for breaking it last week, but facts are facts.
[00:36:46.318 --> 00:36:47.999]  They're always saying we're not credible.
[00:36:47.999 --> 00:36:55.001]  Mainstream media does that because they lie for a living, unless it's a few pockets of reality like Lou Dobbs, like you just heard.
[00:36:55.001 --> 00:37:01.082]  They got relegated over on Fox Business, even though he had higher ratings than anybody ever did on CNN.
[00:37:01.082 --> 00:37:02.403]  It just shows how crazy it is.
[00:37:02.403 --> 00:37:03.323]  But I digress.
[00:37:06.840 --> 00:37:13.641]  That's exactly what we feared is that they would black it out because the president isn't down there in the CIA running all this himself.
[00:37:13.641 --> 00:37:21.043]  Just like I'm not running the shipping department for our products that's a mile away from my other office.
[00:37:21.043 --> 00:37:22.723]  And that's exactly what's happened.
[00:37:22.723 --> 00:37:29.324]  And I guarantee you when it comes out in six months, they're going to dip each piece of paper in big old buckets of black paint.
[00:37:29.324 --> 00:37:31.425]  You'll have Lee Harvey Oswald met with.
[00:37:32.560 --> 00:37:35.402]  Just like Roger Stone said.
[00:37:35.402 --> 00:37:38.944]  So again, this is not the President's doing, and we're not defending the President.
[00:37:38.944 --> 00:37:42.006]  This is what we predicted would happen, Stone.
[00:37:42.006 --> 00:37:50.251]  Interestingly enough, one of the things we learn in these documents is at least 40 journalists were on the direct payroll of the CIA.
[00:37:50.251 --> 00:37:51.672]  Oops.
[00:37:51.672 --> 00:38:00.118]  That's one of the reasons they're fighting so furiously to hide this, because they most likely are paying journalists today.
[00:38:00.118 --> 00:38:01.959]  Secondarily, here's their big problem.
[00:38:02.990 --> 00:38:07.311]  The government, the official finding of the Warren Commission accepted by the U.S.
[00:38:07.311 --> 00:38:13.972]  government is that Lee Harvey Oswald did not kill Kennedy as the agent of a foreign country.
[00:38:13.972 --> 00:38:17.953]  That he was a nutty communist, but he wasn't working for the Russians.
[00:38:17.953 --> 00:38:22.813]  Ergo, how can any of this have national security implications?
[00:38:22.813 --> 00:38:24.454]  It's not possible.
[00:38:24.454 --> 00:38:27.414]  You think about that little problem for them.
[00:38:27.414 --> 00:38:30.495]  Beyond that, they are, I think,
[00:38:32.068 --> 00:38:33.191]  Caught by surprise.
[00:38:33.191 --> 00:38:37.842]  That explains the stories late last week that said you and I were wrong.
[00:38:37.842 --> 00:38:39.125]  They had a leak.
[00:38:39.125 --> 00:38:42.132]  They thought they were going to get him to release nothing.
[00:38:42.905 --> 00:38:47.847]  They were surprised, I think, when he moved towards transparency.
[00:38:47.847 --> 00:38:53.709]  Then they came back and they hard-cased him that these 200 documents will kill agents on the ground, Mr. President.
[00:38:53.709 --> 00:38:56.590]  And he said, I need six months to look at this.
[00:38:56.590 --> 00:38:58.831]  So I think he's skeptical of them.
[00:38:58.831 --> 00:39:00.752]  Read it in his tweets.
[00:39:00.752 --> 00:39:04.153]  He understood what the right thing to do here was.
[00:39:04.153 --> 00:39:08.515]  I think it is crucial to recognize that
[00:39:09.258 --> 00:39:16.780]  What they don't want the voters to figure out, the American people to figure out, is the same things they did then, they are doing now.
[00:39:16.780 --> 00:39:17.261]  Lying.
[00:39:18.934 --> 00:39:20.574]  And by the way, these documents are incredible.
[00:39:20.574 --> 00:39:27.558]  It's got Mockingbird stuff in there, buying off all these newspapers, and it says, we agree that the free press is essential, but we need to do this.
[00:39:27.558 --> 00:39:32.160]  And so there they are, putting out the talking points for the mainstream media, just like they still do today.
[00:39:32.160 --> 00:39:37.643]  I mean, they say it's disinfo that Anderson Cooper's CIA.
[00:39:37.643 --> 00:39:43.026]  The guy's a robber baron heir, I know you know him, and he admittedly worked at the CIA.
[00:39:43.026 --> 00:39:45.007]  It's like CNN saying that
[00:39:46.721 --> 00:39:49.703]  The Nazi collaborator, Jordan Soros, was never a Nazi collaborator.
[00:39:49.703 --> 00:39:52.065]  He went on 60 Minutes and said he was proud of it!
[00:40:18.769 --> 00:40:22.231]  Wow, well it's incredible that there is a lot of meat to what was released.
[00:40:22.231 --> 00:40:24.353]  No wonder they didn't want any of this released.
[00:40:24.353 --> 00:40:33.039]  How they were owning TV journalists and print journalists and controlling major newspapers and how they were trying to shut down other newspapers reporting on it.
[00:40:33.039 --> 00:40:34.279]  I think this is a key thing.
[00:40:34.279 --> 00:40:44.086]  There are several stories today that correctly say that among these documents are proof that the KGB conducted their own extensive investigation into Kennedy's murder.
[00:40:44.850 --> 00:40:45.090]  Okay.
[00:41:01.648 --> 00:41:08.937]  You can go to Books A Million, Barnes & Noble, and soon, if not now, on the InfoWars channel.
[00:41:19.178 --> 00:41:21.420]  Look, globalism's in trouble.
[00:41:21.420 --> 00:41:23.001]  Countries are breaking away from it everywhere.
[00:41:23.001 --> 00:41:24.402]  The economy's coming back.
[00:41:24.402 --> 00:41:26.063]  We're having huge victories.
[00:41:26.063 --> 00:41:27.885]  The deep state's getting hurt, as it turns out.
[00:41:27.885 --> 00:41:29.986]  Everything they said we'd done with the Russians, they'd done.
[00:41:29.986 --> 00:41:34.910]  I don't see how they survive this politically unless Sessions still keeps being weak.
[00:41:34.910 --> 00:41:37.072]  And we know the constellation of power in the White House.
[00:41:37.432 --> 00:41:38.912]  You know, my sources tell me that at this point
[00:42:02.928 --> 00:42:04.529]  So he's a man in a tower.
[00:42:04.529 --> 00:42:05.749]  He's like Rapunzel.
[00:42:05.749 --> 00:42:07.129]  He's in charge of nothing.
[00:42:30.912 --> 00:42:39.737]  Exactly, and he's got his own weird notions about marijuana and asset forfeiture and so on, but he's not even in the play.
[00:42:39.737 --> 00:42:43.139]  Rosenstein's a patriot, but he's like somebody from the 1940s.
[00:42:43.139 --> 00:42:47.822]  He's got a big, giant police state striped on his back and he's in La La Land.
[00:42:47.822 --> 00:42:49.243]  Roger Stone, we'll talk to you again soon.
[00:42:49.243 --> 00:42:50.543]  Thank you so much.
[00:42:50.543 --> 00:42:51.704]  Great to be with you, Alex.
[00:42:51.704 --> 00:42:54.846]  That is exclusive info on the war that just broke down.
[00:42:54.846 --> 00:42:55.807]  Trump said no to 50,000 more troops.
[00:42:58.755 --> 00:43:06.957]  More than 3,000 never-before-seen documents on the assassination of John F. Kennedy are to be released by the National Archives October 26.
[00:43:06.957 --> 00:43:16.938]  The still-secret documents include more than 3,000 that have never been seen by the public and more than 30,000 that have been released previously but with heavy redactions.
[00:43:16.938 --> 00:43:23.360]  This means that thousands of formally classified documents related to Kennedy's assassination will be unveiled.
[00:43:23.360 --> 00:43:25.440]  JFK scholars cannot wait.
[00:43:25.760 --> 00:43:29.502]  Longtime Trump advisor Roger Stone was on the Alex Jones Show this week.
[00:43:29.502 --> 00:43:33.744]  He said he spoke directly to the president and urged him to release all the documents.
[00:43:33.744 --> 00:43:42.649]  However, Stone notes that the president is under tremendous pressure by the Central Intelligence Agency to delay the release of the documents for another 25 years.
[00:43:42.649 --> 00:43:45.150]  Stone said the issue is now transparency.
[00:43:45.150 --> 00:43:47.331]  What is the government hiding at this point?
[00:43:47.331 --> 00:43:55.055]  He believes the documents will show that JFK assassin Lee Harvey Oswald was trained, nurtured, and put in place by the CIA.

[00:45:21.311 --> 00:45:23.431]  My son is growing like a weed using it.

[00:45:25.372 --> 00:45:26.232]  15, incredible.

[00:45:41.818 --> 00:45:43.439]  The globalists win, we're all slaves.
[00:45:43.439 --> 00:45:45.020]  So don't thank me for what I'm doing.
[00:45:45.020 --> 00:45:46.141]  I want to thank you.
[00:45:46.141 --> 00:45:47.721]  We're all in this together.
[00:45:47.721 --> 00:45:53.484]  And when you get the great Molon Labe t-shirts, you get the great books and videos, you're fighting the tip of the spear.

[00:47:01.008 --> 00:47:03.590]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[00:47:18.274 --> 00:47:21.555]  Relentlessly attacking the power structure.
[00:47:21.555 --> 00:47:28.836]  You're listening to Alex Jones.
[00:47:28.836 --> 00:47:39.219]  I've been scanning over this morning the thousands of pages and looking at what's been ferreted out by citizens online doing the research.
[00:47:39.219 --> 00:47:42.820]  It's beautiful to see how when I woke up at 5 a.m.
[00:47:42.820 --> 00:47:44.080]  this morning couldn't go back to sleep.
[00:47:45.385 --> 00:47:59.269]  Already, there were just hundreds of huge stories that had broken about Hoover saying, cover it up, make it look like only Oswald did it, to the CIA controlling the media and running a cover-up.
[00:47:59.269 --> 00:48:02.170]  These are real documents that Trump ordered released.
[00:48:02.170 --> 00:48:08.292]  I'm actually surprised this much came out, now that I've had time to cogitate on it.
[00:48:08.292 --> 00:48:11.372]  Can you imagine what's in the 200, first they were saying 300, now it's 200 files?
[00:48:13.766 --> 00:48:21.348]  Can you imagine what's in the 200 files that's worse than this?
[00:48:21.348 --> 00:48:30.870]  We have this instant gratification society now where they've held all this back for 43, 53, excuse me, almost 54 years.
[00:48:30.870 --> 00:48:33.550]  Coming up next month, it'll be 54 years.
[00:48:33.550 --> 00:48:35.871]  Wow.
[00:48:40.749 --> 00:48:45.153]  And the President is doing what he said he would do.
[00:48:45.153 --> 00:48:50.177]  And then the media spins it, oh, he went back, he reneged!
[00:48:50.177 --> 00:48:52.679]  He could find the cure to cancer.
[00:48:52.679 --> 00:48:55.681]  And they complain about it.
[00:48:55.681 --> 00:49:02.347]  And again, I'm not just here to defend the President, it's just a breath of fresh air that he killed TPP, and is going after political correctness.
[00:49:02.347 --> 00:49:06.250]  And before I get into the real martial law preparations that are going on,
[00:49:09.016 --> 00:49:29.232]  by criminal elements of the deep state that want to trigger a national emergency and then come in in a pincer action as if they're trying to stop the emergency, trying to stop the terror attacks, trying to stop the unrest, and use that to force the president out of office or use that as cover to assassinate him.
[00:49:29.232 --> 00:49:33.815]  And I've had that intel for a while, but it's starting to break in the news, so I'm going to get to that next hour.
[00:49:33.815 --> 00:49:36.037]  Let me hit political correctness here, though, first.
[00:49:38.075 --> 00:49:52.482]  I've been saying for a decade that political correctness is about waging war on communication and getting people to be afraid to talk to each other, and ending true diversity and melting pot, and putting us all in little corporate-controlled globalist groups, like a prison.
[00:49:52.482 --> 00:49:57.505]  You have the feds and the globalists that are the warden, and we're all basically forced into our group.
[00:49:57.505 --> 00:50:00.667]  You can't have any cultural appropriation.
[00:50:00.667 --> 00:50:04.088]  You're not supposed to be a cowboy or an Indian at the Halloween deal.
[00:50:04.088 --> 00:50:06.810]  You're supposed to just be a basket case about what words you use.
[00:50:08.407 --> 00:50:16.531]  Well, all over the Western world they're saying we're not going to teach the classics in English class because those were racist back then.
[00:50:16.531 --> 00:50:19.692]  Shakespeare didn't know any slaves.
[00:50:19.692 --> 00:50:24.394]  There weren't any slaves in England when he was alive except serfs, white slaves.
[00:50:24.394 --> 00:50:26.675]  And it's just insane.
[00:50:26.675 --> 00:50:31.617]  And at Yale and everywhere else they're calling it decolonization.
[00:50:31.617 --> 00:50:34.719]  And so they're going to teach modern English and other languages.
[00:50:35.666 --> 00:50:40.708]  Yeah, let's go to Yale so we don't learn the classics.
[00:50:40.708 --> 00:50:43.209]  Well, Yale is extincting itself.
[00:50:43.209 --> 00:50:45.230]  And then I've got stacks of news here today.
[00:50:45.230 --> 00:50:48.352]  Teddy Roosevelt statue attacked because he must be racist.
[00:50:50.014 --> 00:50:55.878]  And then everyone apologizes, and Ellen DeGeneres gets slammed on Twitter over sexist tweet to Katy Perry.
[00:50:55.878 --> 00:50:58.840]  Because, you know, a woman can't tell another woman she's good-looking or whatever.
[00:50:58.840 --> 00:51:05.645]  It's just, they're making all that the crime, while ignoring the pedophilia, the devil worship, and all the rest of it.
[00:51:05.645 --> 00:51:11.550]  And then they got all these articles about men are hitting on women in the Parliament, and it's wrong.
[00:51:11.550 --> 00:51:16.173]  So again, they're extending that into Harvey Weinstein raping women, reportedly.
[00:51:16.173 --> 00:51:17.354]  That's what all this hype's about.
[00:51:19.517 --> 00:51:21.899]  Meanwhile though, Megyn Kelly's ratings continue to tank.
[00:51:21.899 --> 00:51:24.462]  Megyn Kelly ditched politics for morning television.
[00:51:24.462 --> 00:51:27.485]  Did she make a mistake?
[00:51:27.485 --> 00:51:33.350]  The reason I raise that, did she make a mistake?
[00:51:33.350 --> 00:51:33.811]  It's not...
[00:51:38.860 --> 00:51:41.341]  Something that even has to do with that.
[00:51:41.341 --> 00:51:51.344]  She destroyed herself when she went from being a teleprompter reading info babe that posed as a conservative and uncloaked herself as a wannabe globalist bootlicker.
[00:51:51.344 --> 00:51:52.545]  That's why she's failing!
[00:51:52.545 --> 00:51:53.445]  People hate her!
[00:51:54.989 --> 00:52:01.834]  Sources ESPN heading for more painful layoffs as their ratings continue to tank, just like the NFL.
[00:52:01.834 --> 00:52:06.357]  And they can't stop because it's a cult of leftist control.
[00:52:06.357 --> 00:52:08.318]  Time is cutting back again.
[00:52:08.318 --> 00:52:14.983]  50% after another cut of 40% two years ago.
[00:52:14.983 --> 00:52:16.784]  We're expanding, they're imploding.
[00:52:16.784 --> 00:52:21.488]  That's why they're panicking.
[00:52:21.488 --> 00:52:24.150]  But their answer is just wage war against intellectualism.
[00:52:25.040 --> 00:52:29.743]  And wage war against Shakespeare.
[00:52:29.743 --> 00:52:34.507]  And wage war against all the other great classics.
[00:52:34.507 --> 00:52:36.048]  It's amazing.
[00:52:36.048 --> 00:52:46.135]  They are making real intellectual pursuit evil, where people are like ignorant savages afraid of books, or afraid of history, or afraid of big words.
[00:52:46.135 --> 00:52:47.636]  This is their attack on the West.
[00:52:47.636 --> 00:52:50.358]  The globalists do not want to inform general public.
[00:52:50.358 --> 00:52:54.061]  So they are making people superstitious about all forms of communication.
[00:52:58.021 --> 00:53:01.924]  As Gorka has said, Donald Trump is the kryptonite of political correctness.
[00:53:01.924 --> 00:53:03.286]  We are the kryptonite.
[00:53:03.286 --> 00:53:09.070]  Standing up, not being bullied, wearing InfoWars t-shirts in public doesn't just support the broadcast.
[00:53:09.070 --> 00:53:13.834]  It's an act of defiance and you'll meet like-minded people.
[00:53:13.834 --> 00:53:16.477]  It's time to put InfoWars on your barn or on your car.
[00:53:18.444 --> 00:53:21.385]  Or at least to Molon Labe to meet like-minded people.
[00:53:21.385 --> 00:53:26.788]  We've got a lot of other big specials that are running as well at InfoWarsTore.com, and we need your financial support.
[00:53:26.788 --> 00:53:38.453]  So whether it's fluoride-free, high-quality toothpaste implanted and impregnated with silver and ionine of the highest quality, or whether it's AnthroPlex, talk about stamina, endurance, energy, 50% off, I want you to try it.
[00:53:39.192 --> 00:53:45.177]  It's all there, InfoWarsLive.com, InfoWarsStore.com, or 888-253-3139.
[00:53:45.177 --> 00:54:02.672]  But before I go any further, I just saw this old clip of John Wayne back in like 1976, and just what a real guy, for folks I knew that knew him behind the scenes, just a regular guy with his shirt all unbuttoned out in the desert, and he's just, look, I didn't get a lot of meals when I was growing up.
[00:54:04.889 --> 00:54:06.749]  You don't hear me complaining about it.
[00:54:06.749 --> 00:54:09.450]  And he's saying, I love everybody, no matter what color you are.
[00:54:09.450 --> 00:54:16.031]  But he goes, it's a crutch to teach people they're victims, ruins their lives, and then that's all they become is the victimology.
[00:54:16.031 --> 00:54:22.772]  And I've got Klipschroff, CNN, and other places where they've got Don Lemon and others saying, oh, whites claim they're getting racially attacked.
[00:54:22.772 --> 00:54:24.032]  That's impossible.
[00:54:24.032 --> 00:54:26.613]  Only blacks can be attacked, and we own this.
[00:54:26.613 --> 00:54:28.613]  You don't want to own being a victim.
[00:54:28.613 --> 00:54:31.374]  You don't want to own having chips on your shoulder.
[00:54:31.374 --> 00:54:32.154]  You don't want to own...
[00:54:33.343 --> 00:54:34.523]  Own being a fool.
[00:54:34.523 --> 00:54:36.244]  You want to come together.
[00:54:36.244 --> 00:54:43.506]  Here is the Duke, from the grave, just telling it like it is, and just looking at how ridiculous it is.
[00:54:43.506 --> 00:54:46.887]  They want to cut your legs off of political correctness, folks, and give you a pair of crutches.
[00:54:46.887 --> 00:54:48.187]  Here it is.
[00:54:48.187 --> 00:54:53.249]  His patriotism has never wavered, but today, he's a little disillusioned with modern America.
[00:54:53.249 --> 00:54:59.190]  We're being represented by men who are kowtowing to minorities where they can get votes.
[00:54:59.190 --> 00:55:00.871]  And I think it's bad for
[00:55:03.082 --> 00:55:11.804]  Well, for our country, and I'm sad to see minorities make so much of themselves as a hyphenated American.
[00:55:11.804 --> 00:55:16.665]  I wish they'd all get to thinking that they're Americans, as they should.
[00:55:16.665 --> 00:55:27.627]  And as they have luckily been born here and couldn't be better off in any other place, there shouldn't be so much whining and bellyaching.
[00:55:28.993 --> 00:55:33.155]  In the late 60s and early 70s, there was a period of considerable change.
[00:55:33.155 --> 00:55:36.316]  Civil rights for blacks, equal rights for women.
[00:55:36.316 --> 00:55:38.217]  Has this made America a better place?
[00:55:38.217 --> 00:55:45.400]  I am saddened by the fact that, although we were a matriarchy, I think we will not be any longer.
[00:55:45.400 --> 00:55:51.722]  I think opening doors and tipping your hat to ladies is probably a thing of the past.
[00:55:55.168 --> 00:56:06.655]  The forerunners of the women's liberation of today have taken that feeling away from the average American man.
[00:56:06.655 --> 00:56:07.896]  But what about the civil rights?
[00:56:07.896 --> 00:56:10.297]  I mean, it's necessary... What about the civil rights?
[00:56:10.297 --> 00:56:12.898]  Well, we have 20 million blacks on this continent.
[00:56:12.898 --> 00:56:13.259]  Right.
[00:56:13.259 --> 00:56:20.323]  It was necessary to extend rights to them that perhaps for the first 199 years were denied them in this free America.
[00:56:21.505 --> 00:56:33.149]  I guess that they've had a pretty tough break, but not quite as bad as you and your do-gooder friends would have them believe.
[00:56:33.149 --> 00:56:39.952]  They live as well here as they live in any other country over that 199 years.
[00:56:39.952 --> 00:56:46.094]  True, I think they do have a right to more rights, but it isn't a thing where the rest of
[00:56:47.095 --> 00:56:55.757]  ...of the country should feel terribly guilty about anything because they have had a better life here and their fathers and mothers than they would have had any place else.
[00:57:00.163 --> 00:57:04.286]  And I want to see them have everything.
[00:57:04.286 --> 00:57:12.351]  I don't squawk and cry, baby, and say, geez, I had to go without meals when I was 16 and 17 years old.
[00:57:12.351 --> 00:57:14.373]  It's a terrible thing.
[00:57:14.373 --> 00:57:24.079]  I don't think that you should look back and whine and bellyache or try to hold somebody else guilty for everything.
[00:57:24.079 --> 00:57:26.901]  John Wayne, and notice what he said there.
[00:57:26.901 --> 00:57:29.063]  General Kelly said we should put women on a pedestal.
[00:57:30.330 --> 00:57:33.132]  And they said, oh, that's a horrible crime.
[00:57:33.132 --> 00:57:33.612]  No, no, no.
[00:57:33.612 --> 00:57:35.753]  Put women down, down.
[00:57:35.753 --> 00:57:37.234]  Again, we should put everybody on a pedestal.
[00:57:37.234 --> 00:57:39.215]  Humanity, we should respect ourselves.
[00:57:39.215 --> 00:57:40.316]  But that's not what they want.
[00:57:40.316 --> 00:57:41.476]  They want to break us up.
[00:57:41.476 --> 00:57:42.397]  And they're doing it.
[00:57:42.397 --> 00:57:43.177]  They are slime.
[00:57:43.177 --> 00:57:44.298]  They are scum.
[00:57:44.298 --> 00:57:46.179]  They want to psychically rape everyone.

[00:59:51.633 --> 01:00:05.723]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[01:00:05.723 --> 01:00:06.464]  You got a business.
[01:00:06.464 --> 01:00:09.266]  You didn't build that.
[01:00:09.266 --> 01:00:10.827]  Somebody else made that happen.
[01:00:18.436 --> 01:00:23.299]  Defending the Republic from enemies, foreign and domestic.
[01:00:23.299 --> 01:00:28.302]  It's Alex Jones.
[01:00:28.302 --> 01:00:28.943]  It's Friday.
[01:00:34.166 --> 01:00:39.167]  I'm gonna open the phones up, bottom of the hour, over the balance of the broadcast.
[01:00:39.167 --> 01:00:42.968]  First-time callers, long-time callers, all I ask is you got a good phone.
[01:00:42.968 --> 01:00:50.990]  To get into the JFK files, to get into the DOD-planned solar storm-based national blackout drill during Antifa protests in November.
[01:00:50.990 --> 01:00:54.250]  That's tied in because it's believed they might actually attack the grid.
[01:00:54.250 --> 01:00:57.171]  That's some of the things they're training to do, along with the jihadis.
[01:00:58.649 --> 01:01:05.392]  And then I've got a bunch of other news here that gets into what's happening in North Korea and a lot of other fronts.
[01:01:05.392 --> 01:01:12.536]  But I was just thinking during the break how Yale is basically saying that the English language is racist.
[01:01:12.536 --> 01:01:17.118]  What it is, is it's the dominant world language that every other government is teaching their people how to use.
[01:01:17.118 --> 01:01:21.480]  So they're trying to hobble students.
[01:01:21.480 --> 01:01:24.301]  And they're also trying to basically put a ball and chain around them.
[01:01:26.388 --> 01:01:33.189]  Just direct that when you go get a degree in English that you don't study William Shakespeare.
[01:01:33.189 --> 01:01:36.630]  Of course, if you read Shakespeare, you'll be anti-establishment.
[01:01:36.630 --> 01:01:37.770]  It's Renaissance literature.
[01:01:37.770 --> 01:01:40.511]  It's super powerful.
[01:01:40.511 --> 01:01:42.471]  Some of the best writing out there.
[01:01:42.471 --> 01:01:47.072]  But, I mean, if they have their way, they're going to ban Charles Dickens.
[01:01:47.072 --> 01:01:48.372]  In fact, they're saying he's a bad guy.
[01:01:48.372 --> 01:01:53.793]  Because Charles Dickens is real sophisticated, makes a lot of sense, and teaches you how the world works.
[01:01:55.145 --> 01:02:01.190]  They don't want people reading Charles Dickinson because it's powerful.
[01:02:01.190 --> 01:02:02.872]  It'll make you want to be a good person.
[01:02:02.872 --> 01:02:05.434]  It's classical liberal thinking.
[01:02:05.434 --> 01:02:14.582]  The counterfeit liberals, just like Glenn Beck would try to get me kicked off radio and try to get my affiliates taken away because he was trying to absorb my audience.
[01:02:14.582 --> 01:02:18.466]  He was the pod person, the body snatcher.
[01:02:18.466 --> 01:02:21.569]  He needs to get rid of the original to be the facsimile.
[01:02:23.021 --> 01:02:25.442]  He didn't finish absorbing me.
[01:02:25.442 --> 01:02:29.064]  In fact, he didn't even really get my pinky.
[01:02:29.064 --> 01:02:31.645]  Such a phony $3 bill.
[01:02:31.645 --> 01:02:33.005]  But that's what they're doing.
[01:02:33.005 --> 01:02:35.786]  And they're trying to assimilate everything.
[01:02:35.786 --> 01:02:45.270]  They are 180 degrees for Martin Luther King saying it's not about what color you are, it's what you stand for, what you do, and what you produce.
[01:02:45.270 --> 01:02:47.491]  That's Martin Luther King at one point.
[01:02:47.491 --> 01:02:49.092]  And then at the polar opposite,
[01:02:52.417 --> 01:03:19.353]  180 degrees the other way you've got the SJW saying it's all about what group you are and who you are and by the way if you're a black person don't wear a cowboy hat and if you're a white person don't you know you got curly hair don't grow it out long or or you know whatever it's insane it's mental illness to tell you how you're supposed to look at what you're supposed to do that is a cult and I forgot all over the country they've come out and said that
[01:03:21.209 --> 01:03:29.734]  Trigonometry, calculus, algebra is white privilege.
[01:03:29.734 --> 01:03:45.063]  And so, mathematics, created by the Chinese and by the Sumerians and by the Greeks, I mean, everybody created their own alphabets, their own forms of math.
[01:03:46.002 --> 01:03:48.164]  That's racist?
[01:03:48.164 --> 01:03:49.464]  And see, I'm not joking.
[01:03:49.464 --> 01:03:54.087]  If you're an illustrator and you think, that's too far, they didn't really do that.
[01:03:54.087 --> 01:03:56.149]  No, that's real.
[01:03:56.149 --> 01:03:59.171]  Mathematics itself operates as whiteness.
[01:03:59.171 --> 01:04:03.153]  Yeah, tell that to the Indian mathematicians.
[01:04:03.153 --> 01:04:05.495]  That's crazy, folks.
[01:04:05.495 --> 01:04:06.175]  There's nothing...
[01:04:08.134 --> 01:04:14.996]  I mean, mathematics is simply equations to understand how matter interacts and how to add things up.
[01:04:14.996 --> 01:04:17.037]  A cash register is not racist.
[01:04:17.037 --> 01:04:23.339]  But again, this is the total mental illness, and they mean business.
[01:04:23.339 --> 01:04:32.162]  They are just creating Froot Loop crazies at these college campuses, and they know.
[01:04:32.162 --> 01:04:36.344]  Now, they're singing in, math is racist.
[01:04:39.975 --> 01:04:42.097]  And men and women being together, it's inherently bad.
[01:04:42.097 --> 01:04:47.684]  Because there's some friction there.
[01:04:47.684 --> 01:04:53.632]  Meanwhile, they don't want to talk about those dungeons where they got those kidnapped little kids.
[01:04:53.632 --> 01:04:54.393]  That's who they are.
[01:04:58.331 --> 01:05:03.033]  You deserve a deep restful sleep with Knockout by InfoWars Life.

[01:06:08.297 --> 01:06:13.099]  Big Brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups.
[01:06:13.099 --> 01:06:14.839]  You want to stop tyranny?
[01:06:14.839 --> 01:06:16.500]  Well, so does he.
[01:06:16.500 --> 01:06:28.723]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[01:06:28.723 --> 01:06:33.565]  I cannot believe that during the break I'm actually having a straight-faced conversation with my great crew.
[01:06:35.183 --> 01:06:49.090]  About all these top engineers at top schools, who are white, who are black, who are women, who are, you know, you name it, coming out and saying, mathematics is racist.
[01:06:49.090 --> 01:06:51.891]  Clocks are racist.
[01:06:51.891 --> 01:06:56.633]  Shakespeare is racist because he lived in a time when colonialism was being lost.
[01:06:56.633 --> 01:07:00.315]  And I'm like, what?
[01:07:00.315 --> 01:07:04.457]  I mean, if one African tribe takes over the next African tribe, that's colonialism.
[01:07:05.441 --> 01:07:12.224]  The idea of people expanding and things is just like it's a white thing is just unbelievable.
[01:07:12.224 --> 01:07:19.268]  How these colleges literally give you a degree in mental illness now.
[01:07:19.268 --> 01:07:22.009]  University of Illinois, one of the top engineering schools in the country.
[01:07:22.009 --> 01:07:25.551]  And then it perpetuates white privilege.
[01:07:29.056 --> 01:07:39.946]  And now, all over the country, in colleges and in high schools and elementary schools, they're giving people good grades because, well, we have fuzzy math.
[01:07:39.946 --> 01:07:43.349]  I remember hearing about fuzzy math 20 years ago, and I thought, they'll never really do that.
[01:07:43.349 --> 01:07:55.619]  And then the Common Core had 2 plus 2 equals 5, and then we got copies of real Common Core, where they're teaching first graders that 2 plus 2 can equal whatever you want, and letting you still have your
[01:07:57.560 --> 01:08:01.461]  Great as an A+, even though you missed half the questions.
[01:08:01.461 --> 01:08:07.824]  I mean, that is sabotage of humanity.
[01:08:07.824 --> 01:08:19.728]  Meanwhile, we've got the entire Russiagate narrative coming out, and it's worse than we thought.
[01:08:19.728 --> 01:08:23.389]  With the Clintons and their entire group of Democrats, I mean, hundreds of Democrats,
[01:08:24.901 --> 01:08:27.882]  Getting individually tens of millions from the Russians.
[01:08:27.882 --> 01:08:31.824]  I mean, the Russians were just wholesale buying the Democratic Party.
[01:08:31.824 --> 01:08:33.224]  So of course the Democrats get scared.
[01:08:33.224 --> 01:08:34.965]  They go, oh my gosh, Trump's got in.
[01:08:34.965 --> 01:08:35.645]  He's about to get in.
[01:08:35.645 --> 01:08:36.365]  What do we do?
[01:08:36.365 --> 01:08:39.266]  Just totally just start saying Russia, Russia, Russia, Russia.
[01:08:39.266 --> 01:08:48.850]  To the point of I walked down the street in Austin and every 20th person, I demonstrated it again on Monday.
[01:08:50.174 --> 01:09:00.461]  I walked around for an hour, and every 20th person or so, just as I predicted, would go, F you, and I heard a few go back to Russia's being screamed at me.
[01:09:00.461 --> 01:09:03.043]  And people would roll down their windows and scream, F you, traitor.
[01:09:03.043 --> 01:09:04.504]  I'd say, how am I a traitor?
[01:09:04.504 --> 01:09:05.944]  And they'd go, you know, you Russian!
[01:09:05.944 --> 01:09:10.327]  I mean, you talk about mental patience, folks.
[01:09:10.327 --> 01:09:15.491]  Hillary, we're now learning, Democrats, hundreds of millions
[01:09:21.189 --> 01:09:23.010]  From the Russians for Uranium One.
[01:09:23.010 --> 01:09:24.491]  Payoffs, everything.
[01:09:24.491 --> 01:09:26.173]  Here's Paul Watson's report on it.
[01:09:26.173 --> 01:09:28.995]  We're going to come back and get the number out and start taking some calls.
[01:09:28.995 --> 01:09:31.937]  Here's Paul Joseph Watson's powerful report.
[01:09:31.937 --> 01:09:34.839]  BS Russian collusion narrative collapses.
[01:09:34.839 --> 01:09:36.040]  Here is the PJW.
[01:09:36.889 --> 01:09:39.930]  So how's that Russian collusion narrative working out for you?
[01:09:39.930 --> 01:09:41.571]  It's completely collapsed.
[01:09:41.571 --> 01:09:45.812]  Everyone is colluding with Russia except Trump.
[01:09:45.812 --> 01:09:55.396]  Basically, you've got the Podesta group, you've got the Hillary campaign, you've got the DNC, you've got the FBI.
[01:09:55.396 --> 01:10:01.398]  Colluding with the Russians to dig up dirt on your political opponents to try to influence an election is bad.
[01:10:01.838 --> 01:10:02.519]  Right?
[01:10:02.519 --> 01:10:03.259]  Really bad.
[01:10:03.259 --> 01:10:04.340]  I mean, when Don Jr.
[01:10:04.340 --> 01:10:07.543]  met with that Russian lawyer, the media went nuts.
[01:10:07.543 --> 01:10:08.964]  That was treason!
[01:10:08.964 --> 01:10:10.085]  Yes, treason.
[01:10:10.085 --> 01:10:13.889]  We're now beyond obstruction of justice in terms of what's being investigated.
[01:10:13.889 --> 01:10:18.913]  This is moving into perjury, false statements, and even into potentially treason.
[01:10:19.113 --> 01:10:20.074]  This is outrageous.
[01:10:36.937 --> 01:10:39.859]  Evidence of willingness to commit collusion.
[01:10:39.859 --> 01:10:43.181]  He's saying, yes, I had the intent to collude.
[01:10:43.181 --> 01:10:47.004]  I went in, I took the meeting, which by definition is colluding.
[01:10:47.004 --> 01:10:51.827]  A senior advisor and someone who was in the top tier of the Trump campaign.
[01:10:53.539 --> 01:10:54.160]  Colluded?
[01:10:54.160 --> 01:11:16.821]  How did the media react to confirmation that Hillary, the DMC and Obama's FBI, colluded with Russia to fund the fake Trump pissgate dossier, and then lied about their involvement for a whole year while pointing the finger at Trump for Russian collusion with no evidence, while that same establishment media helped them promote the lurid fake Trump pissgate dossier?
[01:11:16.821 --> 01:11:18.523]  Well, how do you think they reacted?
[01:11:18.683 --> 01:11:19.624]  They buried it.
[01:11:19.624 --> 01:11:20.844]  They downplayed it.
[01:11:20.844 --> 01:11:31.331]  Despite it being the biggest story of the day by far, ABC devoted just 31 seconds to it at the end of a story about a separate issue.
[01:11:31.331 --> 01:11:32.091]  31 seconds!
[01:11:32.091 --> 01:11:34.313]  Compare that to their coverage of Trump Jr.'
[01:11:34.293 --> 01:11:37.895]  's meeting, which on the day it broke, ran for over 10 minutes!
[01:11:38.215 --> 01:11:43.741]  CNN tucked it down here while giving top billing to a far less important story about WikiLeaks.
[01:11:43.741 --> 01:11:53.291]  How did the media react to the bombshell revelations about Hillary Clinton and the Obama administration colluding with Russia in the Uranium One scandal?
[01:11:53.291 --> 01:12:00.458]  Despite it being the biggest story of the last week, CNN devoted an entire 3 minutes 54 seconds to it.
[01:12:00.658 --> 01:12:02.919]  Over the course of seven days.
[01:12:02.919 --> 01:12:09.280]  But hey, at least they did better than ABC, CBS or NBC, who devoted no time to it whatsoever.
[01:12:09.280 --> 01:12:12.021]  Oh, but the media's not controlled, oh no!
[01:12:12.021 --> 01:12:17.323]  Keith Olbermann, who's been frothing at the mouth about Russia for the past year... Scum!
[01:12:17.323 --> 01:12:18.923]  Russian scum!
[01:12:18.923 --> 01:12:22.444]  ...is now triggered that Trump won't shut up about Russia.
[01:12:22.944 --> 01:12:25.085]  Oh, the sweet, sweet irony!
[01:12:25.085 --> 01:12:28.708]  How did left-wing pundits and celebs react to Trump Jr.
[01:12:28.708 --> 01:12:29.808]  meeting the Russian lawyer?
[01:12:29.808 --> 01:12:33.270]  Joy Reid, Nick Confessori, Alyssa Milano, Matthew Chapman.
[01:12:33.270 --> 01:12:34.971]  They all freaked out!
[01:12:34.971 --> 01:12:39.094]  Colluding with the Russians to do opposition research was dreadful!
[01:12:39.094 --> 01:12:41.255]  Maybe even an imprisonable offence!
[01:12:41.255 --> 01:12:48.740]  How did those very same people react to Hillary and the Dems colluding with the Russians to do opposition research?
[01:12:48.880 --> 01:12:52.003]  Only the American media could make a scandal out of opposition research.
[01:12:52.003 --> 01:12:55.146]  Let the party who has never peddled oppo research cast the first stone.
[01:12:55.146 --> 01:12:57.168]  Honest questions, does it matter who funded it?
[01:12:57.168 --> 01:12:58.189]  It's campaign research.
[01:12:58.189 --> 01:12:59.890]  Isn't campaign research normal?
[01:12:59.890 --> 01:13:02.733]  Senate GOP ruling the lives of scammed vets and identity theft victims tonight.
[01:13:02.733 --> 01:13:03.573]  Media's top story.
[01:13:03.573 --> 01:13:05.035]  Hillary Clinton did opposition research.
[01:13:05.035 --> 01:13:06.056]  So Trump Jr.
[01:13:06.056 --> 01:13:08.378]  having some useless meeting with a Russian lawyer.
[01:13:08.618 --> 01:13:09.758]  That's awful!
[01:13:09.758 --> 01:13:18.782]  The Democratic Party and the Clinton campaign scheming with the FBI to collude with the Russians by producing a fake dossier to influence the election.
[01:13:18.782 --> 01:13:19.862]  That's just fine!
[01:13:19.862 --> 01:13:27.945]  How did the media react when Trump tweeted a week ago that Hillary, the FBI and the Democratic Party were probably behind the pissgate dossier?
[01:13:27.945 --> 01:13:30.686]  CNN said he was floating conspiracy theories.
[01:13:30.686 --> 01:13:32.747]  CNN reporters ridiculed him.
[01:13:33.047 --> 01:13:33.367]  Never.
[01:13:33.367 --> 01:13:35.650]  Trump has said he was a disgrace.
[01:13:35.650 --> 01:13:38.833]  And yet Trump has been proven completely right.
[01:13:38.833 --> 01:13:40.875]  He's totally vindicated.
[01:13:40.875 --> 01:13:46.400]  Just like when they called him crazy for saying his campaign was wiretapped and he was proven completely right about that too.
[01:13:46.400 --> 01:13:49.963]  So Hillary engaged in the dirtiest of dirty tricks.
[01:13:49.963 --> 01:13:56.109]  Oh by the way, we told you this whole Russian collusion narrative was completely fake 10 months ago.
[01:13:56.109 --> 01:13:57.030]  So either Russia
[01:13:57.310 --> 01:14:02.654]  And at the end of it all, after all the hysteria, all the pearl-clutching, all the promises of impeachment, all the investigations,
[01:14:24.128 --> 01:14:32.115]  The only real evidence of Russian collusion was that conducted by Obama's FBI, the DNC, and Hillary Clinton.
[01:14:32.115 --> 01:14:34.677]  Let that sink in.
[01:14:34.677 --> 01:14:35.198]  That's right.
[01:14:35.198 --> 01:14:50.050]  Everyone in the Democratic Party, as they've been doing since they invaded Russia in 1917, Democratic Party, literally out of New York, and then funding out of London, sent 100,000 New Yorkers, who were formerly from Russia, over to take over and set up what they couldn't get done here.
[01:14:50.050 --> 01:14:51.131]  Communism was big in 1917 here.
[01:14:52.745 --> 01:14:55.391]  It was so dangerous it basically got outlawed for a while.
[01:14:55.391 --> 01:15:01.023]  And then they marched back over and just took over Russia and started slaughtering any Christians they could get their hands on.
[01:15:02.048 --> 01:15:04.429]  So that's the bottom line of communism, folks.
[01:15:04.429 --> 01:15:11.372]  It is a liberal, anti-Christian, Antifa movement that has always meant to do what it's now doing.
[01:15:11.372 --> 01:15:13.413]  Very, very powerful information.

[01:17:57.523 --> 01:17:58.023]  Not a group.

[01:17:59.484 --> 01:18:00.804]  It took you over a year to do it.
[01:18:00.804 --> 01:18:02.004]  Why is this so good?
[01:18:02.004 --> 01:18:07.286]  Because people are actually waking up to the problem that pretty much scares me the most.
[01:18:07.286 --> 01:18:20.829]  I mean, I try to make sure that I don't put toxins from food and water and beverages in my system, but right now we're dealing with massive parasites, which is anything that's harmful to your body that lives off a host mechanism.
[01:18:20.829 --> 01:18:22.190]  Right now with all the refugees,
[01:18:22.950 --> 01:18:24.631]  Uh, spreading disease around.
[01:18:24.631 --> 01:18:27.192]  We have biological warfare going on everywhere.
[01:18:27.192 --> 01:18:28.492]  These are all parasites.
[01:18:28.492 --> 01:18:29.613]  Tell us about all the stuff that's in it.
[01:18:29.613 --> 01:18:30.933]  There's so many things that are in it.
[01:18:30.933 --> 01:18:35.435]  You have the neem in there, you have the organic clove bug, the organic wormwood.
[01:18:35.435 --> 01:18:38.697]  I recommend doing a parasite cleanse at least twice a year.
[01:18:38.697 --> 01:18:41.778]  Alright, well, I'm glad we've got some back in because I'm going back on it today.
[01:18:41.778 --> 01:18:42.838]  It just came back in yesterday.

[01:20:12.657 --> 01:20:14.419]  The Alex Jones Show.
[01:20:14.419 --> 01:20:16.620]  Because there is a war on.
[01:20:16.620 --> 01:20:17.621]  Or you're mine.
[01:20:17.621 --> 01:20:21.765]  Bottom line, we're living in incredible times right now.
[01:20:21.765 --> 01:20:22.365]  And... Undoubtedly...
[01:20:43.129 --> 01:20:51.334]  The left is the very same left they were a hundred years ago.
[01:20:51.334 --> 01:21:09.884]  If you go back to the New York Times and the Washington Post in 1917, they were writing glowing reports of the wonderful Americans, Russian immigrants, who were, many of them Jewish, who were getting
[01:21:11.377 --> 01:21:21.782]  As leftists on the ships to travel at the end of World War I to go after the evil monarchy.
[01:21:21.782 --> 01:21:27.365]  They were like George Washington fighting King George III.
[01:21:27.365 --> 01:21:40.332]  The corrupt czars, even though the czars had just fought on the US-British side in World War I, in their weakened state, leftist powers in London and in New York,
[01:21:42.330 --> 01:21:59.558]  Finance, with hundreds of millions of dollars at that time, including Stalin's famous train of gold, with $25 million from the US Treasury, shipped right in to Moscow.
[01:21:59.558 --> 01:22:00.579]  And the minute
[01:22:02.116 --> 01:22:05.919]  They got control of Russia four years later because it took them that long.
[01:22:05.919 --> 01:22:10.242]  Every Christian they could get their hands on was sent to a slave camp or killed.
[01:22:10.242 --> 01:22:13.844]  And it was so enjoyable for the left.
[01:22:13.844 --> 01:22:23.891]  And they got to break up the family and reorganize society and ban the churches and just do all the things they're trying to do here.
[01:22:23.891 --> 01:22:26.933]  Isn't that just sweet?
[01:22:26.933 --> 01:22:28.174]  And that's a historical fact.
[01:22:28.174 --> 01:22:29.315]  So when you see a leftist
[01:22:30.293 --> 01:22:32.254]  At a university or other places?
[01:22:32.254 --> 01:22:34.735]  They're cold-blooded, folks.
[01:22:34.735 --> 01:22:37.596]  I learned this because I would have leftist on as guest.
[01:22:37.596 --> 01:22:38.536]  I would have them here.
[01:22:38.536 --> 01:22:39.836]  Rob Dew has been in some of the meetings.
[01:22:39.836 --> 01:22:43.958]  We'd be at dinner with people that claim they're just liberal.
[01:22:43.958 --> 01:22:53.301]  They say, listen, I like the fact that, you know, you don't like the Republican establishment, but you libertarians better become libertarian socialists because we're going to kill everybody that isn't on board when we take power.
[01:22:54.878 --> 01:23:07.542]  And you know, over the years, covering communist meetings, reading their literature, seeing them on the street, every time I've seen a group of communists out handing out literature or running a table, they won't talk to you until your camera's off and they walk over.
[01:23:07.542 --> 01:23:12.724]  Old ladies, old men, they'll go, we're gonna kill you and everybody like you when we take control.
[01:23:12.724 --> 01:23:13.204]  You understand?
[01:23:13.204 --> 01:23:16.246]  They look at you, they go, yeah, there's gonna be blood.
[01:23:16.246 --> 01:23:18.606]  And they're always like cockroaches.
[01:23:18.606 --> 01:23:19.927]  Weak, ugly, stupid.
[01:23:20.919 --> 01:23:22.020]  Hateful.
[01:23:22.020 --> 01:23:28.523]  But they got an instinct, boy, to get you in a death camp and starve you to death with your family.
[01:23:28.523 --> 01:23:29.624]  They love it.
[01:23:29.624 --> 01:23:32.465]  I mean, they want to kill you and your family.
[01:23:32.465 --> 01:23:33.966]  They want to murder all the police.
[01:23:33.966 --> 01:23:36.007]  They want to burn down success.
[01:23:36.007 --> 01:23:38.288]  They want to just shut the churches down.
[01:23:38.288 --> 01:23:42.630]  And they want everybody to have to bow down to them.
[01:23:42.630 --> 01:23:48.213]  And under their system, you'll have maybe one pair of overalls with holes in it.
[01:23:48.213 --> 01:23:49.634]  They're going to work 18 hours a day.
[01:23:51.732 --> 01:23:55.053]  You're gonna go to all these little commie meetings and have them over you, running your life.
[01:23:55.053 --> 01:23:59.774]  You go read 1984, that's what Stalinism was like.
[01:23:59.774 --> 01:24:03.735]  And George Orwell had been a communist.
[01:24:03.735 --> 01:24:07.236]  One of the leaders of the Fabian Socialists, Eric Blair.
[01:24:07.236 --> 01:24:14.419]  And he gave the entire list of the Communist Party, before he died, was probably poisoned to death, in 1948.
[01:24:19.042 --> 01:24:25.327]  He gave the entire list of the communists of the government, and he said, you need to shut this down.
[01:24:25.327 --> 01:24:28.010]  They plan to end the family.
[01:24:28.010 --> 01:24:29.531]  They plan to dehumanize.
[01:24:29.531 --> 01:24:35.896]  They plan to even end the act of sex between men and women, using feminism.
[01:24:35.896 --> 01:24:38.419]  He said, it's so horrible, I can't believe it.
[01:24:38.419 --> 01:24:43.443]  They're a priesthood of power who just want to torture people to death.
[01:24:47.216 --> 01:24:54.878]  Now you go read that book, ladies and gentlemen, and you understand Eric Blair was O'Brien and was Winston.
[01:24:54.878 --> 01:24:59.959]  He wore both those hats, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:24:59.959 --> 01:25:02.439]  Eric Blair tortured people.
[01:25:02.439 --> 01:25:04.620]  Eric Blair killed people.
[01:25:04.620 --> 01:25:13.562]  Eric Blair, you read that book, he's O'Brien and he's also Winston.
[01:25:13.562 --> 01:25:15.402]  And you want to know what the communists want to do to you?
[01:25:17.284 --> 01:25:24.267]  They want to hurt humanity because it's a sick cuckolding.
[01:25:24.267 --> 01:25:34.391]  It's the extreme of a guy that wants to watch 10 guys with his wife and have her tell him he's pathetic while it happens.
[01:25:34.391 --> 01:25:37.792]  Now, some men are into that.
[01:25:37.792 --> 01:25:42.294]  Globalism is a satanic death cult of people
[01:25:44.735 --> 01:25:58.683]  That want to feed on other people, and hurt other people, and have strong men and women, the very best in society, brainwashed under their control, and when they're done with them, hang them up by their heels and torture them to death.
[01:25:58.683 --> 01:26:13.031]  Because they're threatened by a big, strong, powerful man that's already done service to them, but when they're through, just like the horse and animal farm that helped bring them to power, the pigs load him up on an ox cart and ship him to a glue factory.
[01:26:16.539 --> 01:26:23.861]  You can allegories and what Orwell told you is what someone inside their system did.
[01:26:23.861 --> 01:26:28.002]  He worked for the empire and was an imperial policeman and did bad things.
[01:26:28.002 --> 01:26:30.663]  So he became a communist thinking, oh, that's the other side.
[01:26:30.663 --> 01:26:31.924]  I'll fix it being a communist.
[01:26:31.924 --> 01:26:38.826]  Then he found out it was even worse.
[01:26:38.826 --> 01:26:40.306]  And that it was a dialectic.
[01:26:43.912 --> 01:27:04.384]  So, there's no doubt, you understand, the average leftist walking down the street is either a mindless idiot, a slave, but more and more of them, they know, they're little weak cowards, but they imagine them in their black uniforms, and they've got us in camps, and they're beating us and torturing us, and they've got all this, everything's theirs, and they're in charge of everything.
[01:27:04.384 --> 01:27:05.805]  Those people never are put in charge.
[01:27:05.805 --> 01:27:07.266]  They're the first ones to get wiped out.
[01:27:19.301 --> 01:27:22.823]  It's the 100th anniversary of the Bolshevik Revolution.
[01:27:22.823 --> 01:27:28.245]  They told you since the 80s that communism didn't exist anywhere in the world, even though they now admit it's exploding on the rise.
[01:27:28.245 --> 01:27:37.329]  It's been quietly beavering away, calling itself anti-fascist, just like they would do in the 1917.
[01:27:37.329 --> 01:27:41.791]  And then they just flood out of their roach holes.
[01:27:41.791 --> 01:27:42.632]  And they're planning.
[01:27:44.315 --> 01:27:53.398]  To blow up Transformers, to shoot cops, and to kill public figures starting November 4th.
[01:27:53.398 --> 01:28:06.821]  And that there's going to be this big overthrow, and you got the Democratic Party pushing it, and all these other subgroups, and some of them are useful idiots, and some of them know what they're a part of, others don't, but you read the socialist publications, the communist publications, they want a violent revolution.
[01:28:06.821 --> 01:28:08.502]  That's the hallmark of what they do.
[01:28:11.519 --> 01:28:34.365]  And the little spoiled rotten millennials with their slave phones made in China under that crony capitalist fascist regime that's their model and they just dream as little soft stupid spoiled rotten nobodies of the power they're gonna have in this big juicy bloodletting.
[01:28:34.365 --> 01:28:39.046]  Well this is not 1917 Russia and I will assure you
[01:28:42.449 --> 01:28:45.856]  That this is going to be their big defeat.
[01:28:45.856 --> 01:28:48.322]  I will assure you they've met their water loop.
[01:28:48.322 --> 01:28:51.388]  And I will assure you everything they think they're going to do to us is going to happen to them.
[01:28:56.775 --> 01:28:57.676]  It's a no-brainer.
[01:28:57.676 --> 01:29:00.057]  A Big Berkey water filter is the one you need, period.

[01:32:36.235 --> 01:32:41.399]  We'll be hearing from Alex Jones regularly, as well as taking your phone calls.
[01:32:41.399 --> 01:32:45.001]  The liberal establishment media has controlled the narrative for too long.
[01:32:45.001 --> 01:32:47.904]  The silent majority is no longer silent.
[01:32:47.904 --> 01:32:59.233]  This is The War Room.
[01:32:59.233 --> 01:33:01.875]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[01:33:38.216 --> 01:33:39.798]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:33:39.798 --> 01:33:41.621]  I'm your host Alex Jones.
[01:33:41.621 --> 01:33:47.991]  And after Trump, I am one of the most hated pro-Western individuals in the world.
[01:33:47.991 --> 01:33:51.176]  Simply because I've actually studied the globalists and who they are and what they are.
[01:33:52.375 --> 01:34:03.043]  They are in open war against reality, against creation, against common sense, against the family, because they seek to dominate and control.
[01:34:03.043 --> 01:34:12.791]  And it may seem crazy to see the left saying all math, clocks, science is racist, literature is racist, ban everything, don't teach English anymore, it's racist.
[01:34:14.986 --> 01:34:21.809]  Until you understand they are technicians that want to be cult leaders and they've got to train you to accept the absurd.
[01:34:21.809 --> 01:34:27.512]  You always hear about cults wanting people to go along with absurd ideas and things that don't make sense.
[01:34:27.512 --> 01:34:29.873]  You go, why do they have them do that?
[01:34:29.873 --> 01:34:42.078]  Because they want you to pass a litmus test and show you'll do anything to get people into a cult mentality so that you'll do more and more extreme things if they tell you to, including blowing yourself up as a suicide bomber.
[01:34:44.048 --> 01:34:48.272]  And Islam in its orthodox form is a cult.
[01:34:48.272 --> 01:34:49.853]  The leftist movement's a cult.
[01:34:49.853 --> 01:34:53.896]  And that's why it works so closely together.
[01:34:53.896 --> 01:35:02.944]  And the acolytes of it keep believing they're going to get this heavenly future if they just join it.
[01:35:02.944 --> 01:35:08.309]  I have known people that have told me, listen Alex, I can't handle the reality of the New World Order.
[01:35:08.309 --> 01:35:09.510]  I know it's true.
[01:35:09.510 --> 01:35:12.112]  I'm deciding to join the Matrix and just buy into it.
[01:35:13.311 --> 01:35:20.376]  And I'm gonna go to wine houses and poetry things and just buy into loving Hillary.
[01:35:20.376 --> 01:35:28.401]  And again, they just go to the poetry deals and drink wine, and then all just go, oh, we're intellectual, oh, we're intellectual, and just repeat that over and over again.
[01:35:28.401 --> 01:35:29.341]  Well, they're the opposite.
[01:35:29.341 --> 01:35:37.046]  It's a cult of not having to think and just joining it, and just, and then, oh, we have a job for you now.
[01:35:37.046 --> 01:35:38.747]  Oh, we're gonna promote you now.
[01:35:38.747 --> 01:35:40.809]  You just wanna totally turn yourself over to this.
[01:35:42.227 --> 01:35:46.689]  But that's only for this season.
[01:35:46.689 --> 01:35:54.533]  This is the end of humanity if the globalists are able to carry out their final technocracy plan.
[01:35:54.533 --> 01:36:01.996]  And so what I'm telling cult members of the left is, you're at the end of the line, bro.
[01:36:01.996 --> 01:36:03.457]  You are a schmuck.
[01:36:03.457 --> 01:36:04.898]  You are a sucker.
[01:36:04.898 --> 01:36:06.238]  You are a fool.
[01:36:06.238 --> 01:36:07.499]  Involve the delusional thinking.
[01:36:08.843 --> 01:36:12.485]  And what you're pushing is a takeover culture.
[01:36:12.485 --> 01:36:14.046]  It's an overwrite culture.
[01:36:14.046 --> 01:36:16.707]  It won't be the operating system once the globalists get full control.
[01:36:16.707 --> 01:36:22.830]  It's going to be a very, very centralized, eugenics-based, fascist model.
[01:36:22.830 --> 01:36:30.393]  And in the dialectic, I even see them using your extreme behavior to actually bring in that fascist system of the dialectic.
[01:36:30.393 --> 01:36:31.654]  You are the fascism.
[01:36:32.964 --> 01:36:41.027]  That will trigger fascism under the name fascism, but a more orderly fascism to counter you.
[01:36:41.027 --> 01:36:43.248]  You are morons.
[01:36:43.248 --> 01:36:45.189]  You are chumps.
[01:36:45.189 --> 01:36:46.969]  You are Marx.
[01:36:46.969 --> 01:36:48.650]  You are the prey.
[01:36:48.650 --> 01:36:49.930]  You are wrong.
[01:36:49.930 --> 01:36:51.291]  You have been conned.
[01:36:51.291 --> 01:36:52.571]  You have been lied to.
[01:36:52.571 --> 01:36:58.974]  And I'm not saying that with pleasure to feel intellectually superior to you.
[01:36:58.974 --> 01:37:00.674]  But you can't even talk on the street.
[01:37:00.674 --> 01:37:01.755]  You just scream F.U.
[01:37:01.755 --> 01:37:02.075]  Russian.
[01:37:07.128 --> 01:37:16.310]  I want to go to Steve, I want to go to Kevin, I want to go to Scott, AJ, Carlos, and many, many others.
[01:37:16.310 --> 01:37:33.813]  And what's happening is, just like when you see Keith Olbermann and everybody else going, Russian scum, the filthy, dirty, horrible, evil Russians, and mass murderers, and they're the worst people on earth, and they're the reason, I mean, that's Bill Maher, that's all of them.
[01:37:33.813 --> 01:37:34.473]  They're doing it.
[01:37:36.616 --> 01:37:41.058]  They're doing it, invoking the most hardcore form of racism.
[01:37:41.058 --> 01:37:47.541]  I mean, the Russians... ...apparatus of this country is about to be handed over to scum, who are beholden to scum!
[01:37:47.541 --> 01:37:48.701]  Russian scum!
[01:37:48.701 --> 01:37:55.985]  I mean, the Russians are a race of people, and a culture, and a Christian country, colonized by the left in 1917.
[01:37:59.292 --> 01:38:04.216]  Halfway crawled away with, you know, again, half his face torn off, and he's like trying to recuperate.
[01:38:04.216 --> 01:38:05.157]  Doesn't mean it's perfect.
[01:38:05.157 --> 01:38:09.761]  And the face suckers are up against the window just trying to get in as fast as they can.
[01:38:09.761 --> 01:38:14.645]  George Soros is throwing everything he's got, $18 billion, and bringing down the U.S.
[01:38:14.645 --> 01:38:18.889]  I mean, it is just insane asylum.
[01:38:18.889 --> 01:38:27.196]  And the face suckers are just snapping their teeth, just wanting into the room, just greedily going into complete psychotic ecstasy.
[01:38:28.083 --> 01:38:30.264]  But they're going to run out of energy.
[01:38:30.264 --> 01:38:33.666]  They're going to fall down on the ground and basically politically die, and that's happening.
[01:38:33.666 --> 01:38:35.927]  So right now it's more like a temper tantrum.
[01:38:35.927 --> 01:38:41.010]  A lot of the face suckers are on the ground just going... It was supposed to be all ours!
[01:38:41.010 --> 01:38:45.012]  Christian blood!
[01:38:45.012 --> 01:38:47.994]  They don't know what to do!
[01:38:47.994 --> 01:38:49.735]  We were supposed to be dominant!
[01:38:49.735 --> 01:38:53.337]  We're all a bunch of globalist hunchback crazy scum!
[01:38:53.337 --> 01:38:54.077]  What are we going to do?
[01:38:54.077 --> 01:38:54.858]  We want to paint!
[01:38:55.677 --> 01:38:57.238]  But the innocents blot all over the walls!
[01:38:57.238 --> 01:38:59.760]  We wanted to orgy in their blood!
[01:38:59.760 --> 01:39:01.381]  We were promised it by our God!
[01:39:01.381 --> 01:39:03.523]  We're not getting it quick enough!
[01:39:03.523 --> 01:39:14.691]  I mean, you go to an Antifa event, they are the filthy, stupid, ugly, stinking piles of trash.
[01:39:14.691 --> 01:39:18.894]  And they know they are, and they like it.
[01:39:18.894 --> 01:39:22.016]  And they're gonna kill you if they get their hands around your neck.
[01:39:22.016 --> 01:39:24.378]  Because they're just the little front-line babies
[01:39:25.390 --> 01:39:28.232]  Back in the shadows is their mommies.
[01:39:28.232 --> 01:39:31.274]  Big spider-like pig women.
[01:39:31.274 --> 01:39:31.894]  Pig men.
[01:39:31.894 --> 01:39:33.916]  Go to a communist meeting.
[01:39:33.916 --> 01:39:37.979]  I mean, you nasty, slimy, filthy, hateful people.
[01:39:37.979 --> 01:39:39.940]  They never buy each other anything.
[01:39:39.940 --> 01:39:40.821]  Y'all just clutch.
[01:39:40.821 --> 01:39:45.164]  They've all got, like, apartment houses and money and banks that's filled with cash.
[01:39:45.164 --> 01:39:46.404]  Slithering around.
[01:39:46.404 --> 01:39:48.066]  They never pay taxes.
[01:39:48.066 --> 01:39:48.706]  They nail.
[01:39:48.706 --> 01:39:49.406]  They're just evil.
[01:39:53.300 --> 01:40:09.207]  And then they attract all these chicken necks and cowards to join them for the promise of power, when you'll be nothing but tread grease for the war engine's wheels.
[01:40:09.207 --> 01:40:16.810]  Just as I say this, they're search engine-ing everything I say, and it's just, leftist men, weak, and I wouldn't even say physically weak, weak mentally.
[01:40:16.810 --> 01:40:18.551]  Six times more likely to steal.
[01:40:20.811 --> 01:40:25.755]  What is it, nine times we're allowed to give to charity or am I flipping the numbers?
[01:40:25.755 --> 01:40:29.418]  And again, there's this thing of the weak to pull down the strong.
[01:40:29.418 --> 01:40:33.160]  So first they convince the strong to let them run everything.
[01:40:33.160 --> 01:40:40.626]  And then you learn, no, they're actually want to have a ritual of demasculating us.
[01:40:40.626 --> 01:40:44.369]  And it's all an existential exercise of power.
[01:40:44.369 --> 01:40:48.372]  I promise we're going to your calls when we come back in the next segment to talk about this and a lot more.
[01:40:50.179 --> 01:40:53.341]  But, and I'm not knocking men that aren't big and muscular.
[01:40:53.341 --> 01:41:00.746]  I think it's a statistical thing that that's the type of folks that they end up recruiting to authoritarianism many times.
[01:41:00.746 --> 01:41:04.329]  It's larger than that, and the culture does this to people.
[01:41:04.329 --> 01:41:07.771]  Most of the time, they're not even really evil at the grassroots level.
[01:41:07.771 --> 01:41:18.639]  They feel disempowered, they've been made to be fearful and broken down, and then they're inducted into the communism, into the authoritarianism, as if this will make you strong now,
[01:41:19.159 --> 01:41:25.681]  You've got to be nastier than they are.
[01:41:25.681 --> 01:41:33.084]  But the ones controlling it are always devil worshipers.
[01:41:33.084 --> 01:41:43.508]  If you see communist stickers on somebody's car and then you go in their house to do a repair job, I had several repair jobs.
[01:41:43.508 --> 01:41:46.609]  I worked for an exterminator off and on for a year.
[01:41:47.873 --> 01:41:50.614]  I worked for a carpet cleaning company.
[01:41:50.614 --> 01:41:52.514]  And you learn a lot going to people's houses.
[01:41:52.514 --> 01:41:59.596]  And if you see communist stuff on a car, you don't see communist stuff inside.
[01:41:59.596 --> 01:42:04.697]  You see devil worship.
[01:42:04.697 --> 01:42:07.577]  And that's who these people are, folks.
[01:42:07.577 --> 01:42:10.398]  Pot-bellied, pedophile, devil worshipers.
[01:42:11.241 --> 01:42:16.186]  And all they want to do is run you into the ground because they hate you existing.
[01:42:16.186 --> 01:42:17.888]  They hate the fact you're good.
[01:42:17.888 --> 01:42:19.369]  They hate the fact you love God.
[01:42:19.369 --> 01:42:21.111]  They want to destroy you.
[01:42:21.111 --> 01:42:21.672]  Period.
[01:42:21.672 --> 01:42:24.554]  And they mean business.
[01:42:24.554 --> 01:42:25.535]  So just remember that.
[01:42:25.535 --> 01:42:28.799]  And they hate me because I see them.
[01:42:28.799 --> 01:42:29.439]  And I know them.
[01:42:30.320 --> 01:42:35.782]  Now, if you want to fight back against the scum, we have a new limited edition t-shirt that we're only selling for a month.
[01:42:35.782 --> 01:42:39.804]  We've taken the stupid Antifa logo and redid it.
[01:42:39.804 --> 01:42:42.745]  We're anti-socialism and we're anti-fascism.
[01:42:42.745 --> 01:42:45.066]  It's got the American flag and the Gadsden flag.
[01:42:45.066 --> 01:42:46.547]  It's really powerful.
[01:42:46.547 --> 01:42:51.489]  It's in the t-shirt section of InfoWarsStore.com or call toll-free, AAA-253-3139.
[01:42:51.489 --> 01:42:53.010]  The anti-fascist, anti-communist shirt.
[01:42:57.139 --> 01:43:04.603]  I am very proud to announce the introduction of the highest quality InfoWars Biome Defense Probiotic.
[01:43:04.603 --> 01:43:17.810]  We wanted to come out with the largest spectrum of high quality known probiotics that have been proven to improve overall digestion and health and detoxification in the body.
[01:43:18.757 --> 01:43:30.640]  Biome Defense is an exclusive blend of 50 billion live and active cultures from over 23 different probiotic strains that are known to support digestion and intestinal function.
[01:43:30.640 --> 01:43:36.602]  Our researchers are confident that we have been able to develop what will be the leading probiotic on the market.
[01:43:37.342 --> 01:43:46.369]  Secure your biome defense in ultra strength or regular strength at InfoWarsLife.com today and get started supporting your digestive system naturally.
[01:43:46.369 --> 01:43:54.555]  We've been testing this formula for years, but this is the limited first run to the public, so please take advantage of it today, support your own health, and support the InfoWar.
[01:43:56.533 --> 01:44:03.719]  This week, the FBI released over 1,500 heavily redacted documents concerning the Sandy Hook investigation.
[01:44:03.719 --> 01:44:11.066]  In many cases, entire pages are redacted, but unredacted portions of the Sandy Hook documents continue to support the narrative.
[01:44:11.066 --> 01:44:18.653]  20-year-old shooter Adam Lanza was a lonely, tech-savvy high school dropout, an experienced shooter with an interest in weapons.
[01:44:18.933 --> 01:44:24.835]  A functioning autistic with a personality disorder and a recluse who liked to play video games all day.
[01:44:24.835 --> 01:44:27.416]  But there's one key update on page 41.
[01:44:27.416 --> 01:44:37.520]  A source told agents that Lanza, while in the 9th grade, was visited at his home by either CIA or FBI agents after hacking a government computer system.
[01:44:37.520 --> 01:44:43.662]  The source said authorities told Nancy Lanza that if her son was that smart, he could have a job with them someday.
[01:44:44.122 --> 01:44:46.166]  InfoWars has the documents.
[01:44:46.166 --> 01:44:46.987]  Read them right now.
[01:44:46.987 --> 01:44:49.852]  They're posted in their entirety at the article.
[01:44:49.852 --> 01:44:54.200]  FBI releases heavily redacted Sandy Hook investigation docs.
[01:44:54.200 --> 01:44:56.183]  Leanne McAdoo, InfoWars.com.
[01:44:57.469 --> 01:45:04.976]  Now ladies and gentlemen, we're running the biggest special we've ever had for our best-selling product, Brain Force.
[01:45:04.976 --> 01:45:08.959]  Now Brain Force Plus, there's 20% more in each bottle.
[01:45:08.959 --> 01:45:15.665]  And we're now purchasing so much of it from the major organic manufacturer here in the United States that we've been able to get it for less.
[01:45:15.665 --> 01:45:21.110]  So I'm offering for the first time ever 50% off, and I thought I could offer this for maybe a month.
[01:45:21.750 --> 01:45:30.194]  I'm going to have to stop this special within a week because it is blasting out of our warehouse because the fans of it already are stocking up.
[01:45:30.194 --> 01:45:31.935]  They know how great it is.
[01:45:31.935 --> 01:45:36.317]  A whole bunch of organic, natural, healthy, known nootropics.
[01:45:36.317 --> 01:45:39.118]  And if you want good, clean, focused energy,
[01:45:39.338 --> 01:45:44.520]  Then Brain Force is for you and you're supporting the broadcast at the same time.
[01:45:44.520 --> 01:45:45.400]  It's a good deal at $39.
[01:45:45.400 --> 01:45:49.202]  It's $19.96 at Infowarslife.com or simply call toll-free 888-253-3139.
[01:45:57.765 --> 01:46:06.012]  Please listen carefully because I'm about to point out three things that will save you a lot of money while you get high quality products and fund the InfoWar.
[01:46:06.012 --> 01:46:07.253]  A 360 win.
[01:46:07.253 --> 01:46:13.798]  Number one, when you choose AutoShip before checkout, we give you 10% off on your order at InfoWarshore.com.
[01:46:13.798 --> 01:46:21.344]  Number two, you're also able to get items that are out of stock when you sign up for AutoShip because we hold back a surplus for AutoShip customers.
[01:46:21.724 --> 01:46:26.809]  Number three, we're giving you free shipping on all orders above $50.
[01:46:26.809 --> 01:46:32.914]  Listeners have been requesting this for years because it's so easy to forget to reorder the products that you need each month.
[01:46:32.914 --> 01:46:40.721]  Just go to InfoWarsStore.com, select your favorite product or products, click on AutoShip, and choose how often you want us to send you another order.
[01:46:40.721 --> 01:46:47.927]  As you know, I coined the term 360Win, and with the new AutoShip feature in InfoWarsLife.com, this is a sure win.
[01:46:47.927 --> 01:46:48.728]  10% off on AutoShip.
[01:46:48.888 --> 01:46:51.309]  Win-win-win at InfoWarsLife.com.
[01:46:51.309 --> 01:46:53.291]  Free shipping on orders above 50 bucks.
[01:46:53.291 --> 01:46:59.614]  And all out-of-stock items are never out of stock when you sign up for AutoShip.
[01:46:59.614 --> 01:47:02.236]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:47:20.171 --> 01:47:27.139]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[01:47:27.139 --> 01:47:36.631]  Alright callers, I'm taking your calls starting here in just a minute or two, right through the entire third hour today.
[01:47:36.631 --> 01:47:38.093]  Then I guess into the fourth as well.
[01:47:40.825 --> 01:47:48.527]  After I take about 30 minutes of calls though, I'm gonna try to just read like a hundred headlines here, just to get a spattering of how crazy all this is.
[01:47:48.527 --> 01:47:52.688]  Hillary faces electric chair if charged in 1950s.
[01:47:52.688 --> 01:47:56.549]  Powerful article up at newswars.com.
[01:47:56.549 --> 01:47:57.610]  That's a powerful headline.
[01:47:57.610 --> 01:48:05.452]  I think it was just Hillary would face the electric chair if she got caught doing what she's done in the 50s.
[01:48:05.452 --> 01:48:06.312]  That's right.
[01:48:06.312 --> 01:48:09.833]  They would Rosenberg her faster than your head could spin.
[01:48:11.328 --> 01:48:13.209]  Rosenbergs were executed for sharing U.S.
[01:48:13.209 --> 01:48:16.830]  nuclear secrets with the Soviets.
[01:48:16.830 --> 01:48:39.157]  Sebastian Gorka, military analyst and former top aide to President Trump, compared potential high crimes involving the Obama administration, DNC, and Russia to those committed during the Cold War by the likes of Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, who were convicted of espionage and executed via electric chair, giving their communist cohorts in Russia the bomb.
[01:48:40.993 --> 01:48:42.894]  Just like, I mean, why not?
[01:48:42.894 --> 01:48:53.879]  I mean, they'd had family and friends and other New Yorkers a few decades before go over to help take over Russia and carry out a good old jolly leftist extermination fund.
[01:48:53.879 --> 01:48:59.261]  I mean, this is left having fun.
[01:48:59.261 --> 01:49:04.424]  There's nothing like shipping whole villages to forced labor camps for 10 years and then, you know, maybe 30% live.
[01:49:07.458 --> 01:49:13.101]  And how dare the Rosenbergs get put in that electric chair?
[01:49:13.101 --> 01:49:18.804]  Hillary, got the same career selling out our secrets to foreign powers, Communist China, you name it.
[01:49:18.804 --> 01:49:21.846]  And of course, she's the globalist, she's the enemy, she's the one selling our country out.
[01:49:21.846 --> 01:49:27.329]  So she points her finger at me, by name, and the President, and you the American people.
[01:49:27.329 --> 01:49:32.272]  She says, you're idiots.
[01:49:32.272 --> 01:49:34.313]  She says, you're morons.
[01:49:36.627 --> 01:49:39.929]  You voted for Trump because you're a dupe of the Russians.
[01:49:39.929 --> 01:49:43.891]  Yeah, right.
[01:49:43.891 --> 01:49:45.592]  Oh, I love the new pumpkins that are out.
[01:49:45.592 --> 01:49:47.693]  I think I'm going to try to rip that off.
[01:49:47.693 --> 01:49:51.215]  Everybody should use just every form of art to fight the globalists.
[01:49:51.215 --> 01:49:55.577]  Since the left wants Halloween band now because they say people express themselves and wear costumes.
[01:49:55.577 --> 01:49:57.618]  They just want to run everything.
[01:49:59.468 --> 01:50:01.590]  Even though it's a cultic, they don't like it.
[01:50:01.590 --> 01:50:15.801]  But you could have it like Hillary, you know, lock her up, and you have a little pumpkin inside the pumpkin, and then you put up a little, put up a little deal of bars, like she's in jail.
[01:50:15.801 --> 01:50:22.506]  Absolutely, that's the way we communicate, and let the thugs know we're gonna exercise our free speech, whether you like it or not.
[01:50:22.506 --> 01:50:25.489]  Briefly, I'm going to start coming out
[01:50:26.368 --> 01:50:31.170]  Not with just limited edition t-shirts sometimes, because that's our most popular, is limited edition run.
[01:50:31.170 --> 01:50:38.953]  I'm going to start coming out every month with a new t-shirt, and then when the month's gone, the t-shirt's gone.
[01:50:38.953 --> 01:50:42.114]  If it's real popular, we may do another variant, but it'll be a limited edition.
[01:50:42.114 --> 01:50:44.635]  These are super high quality.
[01:50:44.635 --> 01:50:48.076]  We have the new one that is an anti-fascist, anti-globalist,
[01:50:49.798 --> 01:50:57.165]  Basically the Antifa logo but changed to an American flag and a Gadsden flag with Infowars.com and an American flag on the right arm.
[01:50:57.165 --> 01:51:06.193]  And it is a limited deal and three stickers come with it as well.
[01:51:06.193 --> 01:51:10.797]  There's a matching three-inch sticker for your car or wherever that comes with it.
[01:51:10.797 --> 01:51:15.161]  I'm gonna tell the shipping department in all t-shirts now, orders, I'm gonna have
[01:51:17.286 --> 01:51:24.853]  20 bumper stickers put in all orders so that you can bomb your local area, in a legal and lawful way, in the information war, of course.
[01:51:24.853 --> 01:51:28.256]  In public places, get the stickers up!
[01:51:28.256 --> 01:51:44.550]  So, the t-shirts and the bumper stickers are a big part of the info war, and just like we have auto-ship for things like the supplements and coffee, we're gonna have a t-shirt of the month where you basically can cancel any time, but where you get 30 to 50% off, depending on the t-shirt,
[01:51:47.096 --> 01:51:53.861]  When you order and then each month we just ship you a new shirt and then you just cancel anytime with one click of a mouse.
[01:51:53.861 --> 01:51:58.505]  We haven't set that up yet, but this is the first limited edition in the t-shirt club.
[01:52:00.490 --> 01:52:03.713]  And we've got hundreds of t-shirts there and a lot of them are about to sell out.
[01:52:03.713 --> 01:52:05.275]  Trump 2020, Hillary 2017.
[01:52:05.275 --> 01:52:07.297]  I'm not going to make any more of those.
[01:52:07.297 --> 01:52:08.538]  That's limited edition.
[01:52:08.538 --> 01:52:10.980]  We've got the winter style hoodies.
[01:52:10.980 --> 01:52:12.222]  Join or die.
[01:52:12.222 --> 01:52:13.463]  Infowarslife.com.
[01:52:13.463 --> 01:52:15.084]  That's where you'll find all the supplements.
[01:52:15.084 --> 01:52:17.627]  Infowarsstore.com is the umbrella site.
[01:52:17.627 --> 01:52:19.689]  And a bunch of the CNN shirts are limited edition.
[01:52:19.689 --> 01:52:20.510]  They're all selling out.
[01:52:21.638 --> 01:52:26.384]  Whatever you do, get your Colloidal Silver 50% off, get your Anthraplex 50% off, get your Winter Sun 50% off.
[01:52:26.384 --> 01:52:30.049]  We've never had Winter Sun 50% off, but it's a really high quality product.
[01:52:30.049 --> 01:52:35.296]  It's a bestseller, and Anthraplex is amazing, especially the dry form of Supramel Vitality.
[01:52:35.296 --> 01:52:38.640]  So try that out today, and we've got Anthra...
[01:52:39.341 --> 01:52:42.982]  Plex with Brain Force Plus at 50% off right now.

[01:53:03.680 --> 01:53:04.080]  Thank you, Alex.
[01:53:04.080 --> 01:53:04.500]  Just a comment.
[01:53:04.500 --> 01:53:05.201]  When President
[01:53:32.286 --> 01:53:35.409]  Trump said that there was nothing he could do.
[01:53:35.409 --> 01:53:52.541]  This was a very meaningful phrase to me because, as you know, I analyze semantic phrases and why people say the things they say, and it's not something that he would have said for legal reasons or constitutional reasons, because there are none.
[01:53:52.541 --> 01:54:00.867]  Essentially, I believe it's because the people that are going to be mentioned in those documents are alive today.
[01:54:01.678 --> 01:54:13.723]  And one in particular is George Herbert Walker Bush and his relationship with the Kennedy Association is one that I happen to have come across a long time ago but on a different track altogether.
[01:54:13.723 --> 01:54:22.626]  I was actually looking at Charles de Gaulle's relationship in Quebec and what was happening here and it turns out that
[01:54:23.946 --> 01:54:32.568]  Uh, agents of, uh, French agents were actually operating, uh, in Texas in the, in the Fort Worth, uh, Midland Dallas area.
[01:54:32.568 --> 01:54:34.929]  So you're talking about the Jackal?
[01:54:34.929 --> 01:54:46.091]  Well, in particular, uh, spelled by the name of Michel, um, Mertz, who was, uh, uh, an assassin for the barboozers of, uh, you know, the Algerian, um, uh, episodes with De Gaulle.
[01:54:46.091 --> 01:54:53.193]  And in particular, he, this, this fellow, Mertz, uh, actually was seen photographed with, um, with, um,
[01:54:54.286 --> 01:54:59.931]  People like, um, um, I'm trying to recall specifically.
[01:54:59.931 --> 01:55:01.333]  Here's what goes on.
[01:55:01.333 --> 01:55:07.779]  When you do something like killing a president, you get a bunch of groups, mafia together, foreign governments, and then a bunch of people take part.
[01:55:07.779 --> 01:55:09.381]  So everyone's involved and implicated.
[01:55:09.381 --> 01:55:10.942]  It's like Julius Caesar.
[01:55:10.942 --> 01:55:13.364]  Everybody's got stabbed to prove they're in the club.
[01:55:14.105 --> 01:55:18.089]  And so that's why Oklahoma City, they didn't just have foundation, U.S.
[01:55:18.089 --> 01:55:31.462]  foundations and the FBI and the ATF there, they had German intelligence and others helping plant the bombs so that, because the Germans are run by a leftist operation as well, to blame the right wing so that they all wouldn't tattle on each other.
[01:55:31.462 --> 01:55:35.727]  So, you know, it's kind of like the pedophiles, you know, you gotta rape kids together to be in the club.
[01:55:35.727 --> 01:55:36.748]  And so that's what they're doing there.
[01:55:37.639 --> 01:55:37.779]  Yes.
[01:55:37.779 --> 01:55:37.839]  Yes.
[01:55:53.872 --> 01:55:57.595]  Oh, I mean, George Herbert Walker Bush became the head of the CIA just a few years later.
[01:55:57.595 --> 01:56:03.700]  He was there using the family business as cutouts and offshore drilling rigs and Operation Mongoose and all of it.
[01:56:03.700 --> 01:56:08.444]  And he's in FBI files with J. Edgar Hoover with the assassination.
[01:56:08.444 --> 01:56:13.108]  So, of course, those are the names, reportedly, that are in the files.
[01:56:13.108 --> 01:56:16.291]  And it shows how real these files are that they held them back.
[01:56:16.291 --> 01:56:17.852]  Just look at what they've already released.
[01:56:17.852 --> 01:56:18.713]  It's pretty bombshell.
[01:56:19.639 --> 01:56:31.710]  Yes, but George, but George the Moron Shield was the fellow that introduced Oswald, got him the job in the in the repository building.
[01:56:31.710 --> 01:56:32.251]  Yes.
[01:56:32.251 --> 01:56:45.343]  This is very troubling because this individual later on was one of the most interviewed during the commissions and inquiries and when he was supposed to testify in the 70s he killed himself
[01:56:45.563 --> 01:56:56.168]  Listen, listen, they had treason signs all over Texas, and in Texas, it was the day they killed him, there was people high-fiving themselves in downtown Austin and Dallas and places.
[01:56:56.168 --> 01:56:57.708]  So, I mean, everybody knew.
[01:56:57.708 --> 01:57:00.470]  See, I'm here in Texas, okay?
[01:57:00.470 --> 01:57:06.132]  So, I mean, I've been on airplanes with well-known politicians where they're just bragging about it.
[01:57:06.132 --> 01:57:13.875]  So, I mean, LBJ told his mistress the night before, I told her, I mean, look, look who they had in Dallas the night before.
[01:57:15.842 --> 01:57:29.688]  Nixon, all the bigwigs, were here in a big mafia commission to go ahead because they'd gotten scared and backed off in Chicago and in Miami, and the teams had just refused to kill the President.
[01:57:29.688 --> 01:57:32.750]  But Texas came through, and that's what happened.
[01:57:32.750 --> 01:57:35.671]  And you're absolutely right, those people were all involved.
[01:57:35.671 --> 01:57:43.675]  And for running part of the operation, George Herbert Walker Bush was promoted to the head of the CIA out of nowhere for helping carry out the operation to kill John F. Kennedy.
[01:57:43.675 --> 01:57:44.055]  Stay with us.
[01:57:46.872 --> 01:57:57.475]  We've taken thousands of years of known research and put it together with our own four years of seeking and testing to find the very best systems that God gave us through Mother Nature to detoxify the body.
[01:57:57.475 --> 01:57:59.535]  That's why I'm introducing Z-SHIELD.
[01:57:59.535 --> 01:58:02.396]  Toxic Metal and Chemical Defense Support.
[01:58:02.396 --> 01:58:03.877]  It's made in the USA.
[01:58:03.877 --> 01:58:10.718]  It's filled with known compounds from nature that are absolutely associated with detoxifying the body and it supports the info war.
[01:58:10.718 --> 01:58:11.939]  It is a classical 360 wind.
[01:58:12.799 --> 01:58:22.501]  This is the formula that I personally have been taking for over a year, and now we believe we have come as close to perfection when it comes to a detoxifier as you can possibly get.
[01:58:22.501 --> 01:58:39.304]  You owe it to yourself, you owe it to your family, and you owe it to the future of this country and the world that patriots stay as healthy and as clean and as focused as you can be, because we need you, the remnant of America, to reignite those brushfires to the next level and to be healthy and as focused as you can be.
[01:58:39.304 --> 01:58:42.465]  Thanks to your support and your prayers, together, we're changing the world.
[01:58:42.605 --> 01:58:47.827]  Now it's time to change our bodies with Z-Shield at Infowarslife.com.

[01:59:37.054 --> 01:59:38.476]  That means it's clean.
[01:59:38.476 --> 01:59:39.618]  That means it's pure.

[01:59:49.651 --> 01:59:52.254]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:59:56.581 --> 01:59:58.722]  The world is a dangerous place.
[01:59:58.722 --> 02:00:03.824]  Not because of evil, but because of those who look on and do nothing.
[02:00:03.824 --> 02:00:07.665]  From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[02:00:25.120 --> 02:00:26.020]  I'm taking your phone calls.
[02:00:26.020 --> 02:00:28.681]  Thanks for holding Scott, AJ, Steve, Jeffrey, Kevin and others.
[02:00:28.681 --> 02:00:30.702]  Let's go to Scott in Maryland right now.
[02:00:30.702 --> 02:00:31.743]  You're on the air worldwide.
[02:00:31.743 --> 02:00:33.443]  Go ahead.
[02:00:33.443 --> 02:00:34.704]  Hey, thanks Alex.
[02:00:34.704 --> 02:00:40.126]  I wanted to talk about car culture and how it's uniquely American.
[02:00:40.126 --> 02:00:40.646]  Yes, go ahead.
[02:00:40.646 --> 02:00:41.726]  You hear me?
[02:00:41.726 --> 02:00:43.067]  Alright.
[02:00:43.067 --> 02:00:45.928]  What's perfect is that it's who we are.
[02:00:45.928 --> 02:00:46.948]  We're explorers.
[02:00:46.948 --> 02:00:47.789]  We're builders.
[02:00:47.789 --> 02:00:53.411]  I still remember when I was a kid and I'd go out and help my dad be building old cars out in the garage.
[02:00:54.366 --> 02:00:54.906]  We're good to go.
[02:01:13.141 --> 02:01:19.505]  They know they've lost the gun control battle, and so now they're trying to take our cars and keep us within one spot.
[02:01:19.505 --> 02:01:20.165]  No, you're right.
[02:01:20.165 --> 02:01:23.487]  Cars are uniquely Americana.
[02:01:23.487 --> 02:01:34.973]  It's about openness, it's about the freedom, and they demonize it as sprawl, and they want to take it away, even though electric cars use more energy, hurt the environment more, it's hard to distribute the power.
[02:01:34.973 --> 02:01:40.336]  They don't care because it limits where you can go and what you can do, and they want to remove humans
[02:01:41.681 --> 02:01:49.907]  From being able to take care of themselves, from the land, from being tinkerers, from being engineers, from knowing how to work or operate anything.
[02:01:49.907 --> 02:01:55.872]  That's why they've made the cars and things so impossible to work on that even shops can't work on them now.
[02:01:55.872 --> 02:02:00.976]  You've got to, quote, go to the dealer, and then suddenly the price, you know, is three, four, five times what it was.
[02:02:00.976 --> 02:02:04.699]  So yes, everything is about controlled, contained environments.
[02:02:04.699 --> 02:02:07.321]  Google's announcing they're going to build bubble cities.
[02:02:08.114 --> 02:02:13.978]  And again, with these AI drivers coming in now, they're even taking the ability for you to drive away from them.
[02:02:38.196 --> 02:02:57.472]  Sir, sir, sir, already with Obamacare, computers filled with insurance company actuaries and bioethics board eugenics templates run by the literal Thomas Watson computers, named after a top Nazi, decides what troops get healthcare, who gets surgeries.
[02:02:57.472 --> 02:03:02.757]  That's now coming in where the pediatricians, everybody, are just robots that follow what the computer tells them.
[02:03:03.530 --> 02:03:06.012]  I mean, it is just amazing.
[02:03:06.012 --> 02:03:08.454]  We're already under AI control to a great extent.
[02:03:08.454 --> 02:03:13.158]  We're already under computer automated command and control.
[02:03:13.158 --> 02:03:20.384]  And it's just, they're trying to take everything away from us and just dehumanize us even further with it.
[02:03:20.384 --> 02:03:21.525]  They are the scum of the earth.
[02:03:21.525 --> 02:03:23.387]  They are just absolute trash.
[02:03:23.387 --> 02:03:25.389]  And they say they are.
[02:03:25.389 --> 02:03:29.893]  And people just have to totally break with the globalists, totally break with their whole
[02:03:31.721 --> 02:03:34.482]  Plandopolis, zeitgeist crap.
[02:03:34.482 --> 02:03:49.306]  Because it's not like what we're doing is perfect, but we know that these are literal spiders that are trying to get us to tie ourselves up in webs and present our bellies to them so they can hiss around and hop around and basically have power over us.
[02:03:49.306 --> 02:03:57.168]  It's all about satanic, fallen, vampire-like, goblin creatures having their way over us.
[02:03:59.773 --> 02:04:00.954]  Without a doubt, Alex.
[02:04:00.954 --> 02:04:02.615]  Without a doubt.
[02:04:02.615 --> 02:04:03.676]  They mean business, buddy.
[02:04:03.676 --> 02:04:06.178]  They mean business.
[02:04:06.178 --> 02:04:08.040]  They do.
[02:04:08.040 --> 02:04:08.520]  God bless you.
[02:04:08.520 --> 02:04:10.181]  I appreciate your call.
[02:04:10.181 --> 02:04:13.664]  I mean, listen, everybody should get old cars, keep old cars, even if you got new ones.
[02:04:13.664 --> 02:04:19.629]  Everybody should get back into tinkering, get back into gardening, get back into gunsmithing, get back into just getting outside.
[02:04:19.629 --> 02:04:22.111]  You do that, you break the vampires' backs.
[02:04:22.111 --> 02:04:24.193]  Invite your neighbors over for barbecue.
[02:04:24.193 --> 02:04:25.674]  You know, go for a hike.
[02:04:25.674 --> 02:04:28.196]  The journey of a thousand miles starts with a single step, my friend.
[02:04:28.196 --> 02:04:29.097]  I appreciate you.
[02:04:30.930 --> 02:04:35.031]  Remember, you'll never see the goblins out in the woods.
[02:04:35.031 --> 02:04:37.471]  These are cave dwellers.
[02:04:37.471 --> 02:04:41.952]  They just slop around, just hiding corners who they can hop out and get.
[02:04:41.952 --> 02:04:46.373]  And they know you've got morals, so they guilt you, like Kaa the Jungle Book.
[02:04:46.373 --> 02:04:47.794]  Ah, come into the shadows.
[02:04:47.794 --> 02:04:50.374]  Don't be mean, I'm your friend.
[02:04:50.374 --> 02:04:52.335]  Oh, yes, let me wrap around you.
[02:04:52.335 --> 02:04:53.415]  Mmm, good.
[02:04:56.027 --> 02:05:04.051]  More than 3,000 never-before-seen documents on the assassination of John F. Kennedy are to be released by the National Archives October 26.
[02:05:04.051 --> 02:05:14.215]  The still-secret documents include more than 3,000 that have never been seen by the public and more than 30,000 that have been released previously but with heavy redactions.
[02:05:14.215 --> 02:05:20.438]  This means that thousands of formally classified documents related to Kennedy's assassination will be unveiled.
[02:05:20.618 --> 02:05:23.040]  JFK scholars cannot wait.
[02:05:23.040 --> 02:05:26.803]  Longtime Trump advisor Roger Stone was on the Alex Jones Show this week.
[02:05:26.803 --> 02:05:31.026]  He said he spoke directly to the president and urged him to release all the documents.
[02:05:31.026 --> 02:05:38.851]  However, Stone notes that the president is under tremendous pressure by the Central Intelligence Agency to delay the release of the documents for another 25 years.
[02:05:39.912 --> 02:05:42.433]  Stone said the issue is now transparency.
[02:05:42.433 --> 02:05:44.594]  What is the government hiding at this point?
[02:05:44.594 --> 02:05:52.979]  He believes the documents will show that JFK assassin Lee Harvey Oswald was trained, nurtured, and put in place by the CIA.
[02:05:52.979 --> 02:05:54.920]  Leanne McAdoo, InfoWars.com.
[02:06:01.755 --> 02:06:09.182]  Hello, this is Hank Hill, and I'm telling you what, you need to listen to Alex Jones.
[02:06:09.182 --> 02:06:16.349]  Infowars.com.
[02:06:16.349 --> 02:06:22.615]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[02:06:37.168 --> 02:06:38.809]  We're now into hour number three.
[02:06:38.809 --> 02:06:41.552]  I've got science and tech news I want to hit.
[02:06:41.552 --> 02:06:45.895]  World news, I want to, the whole Weinstein thing is just exploding.
[02:06:45.895 --> 02:06:48.757]  You've got Yale saying ban English basically, it's racist.
[02:06:48.757 --> 02:06:50.899]  I mean, it's all happening.
[02:06:50.899 --> 02:06:53.061]  Total mental illness, total takeover.
[02:06:53.061 --> 02:06:55.823]  Got North Korea news, but right now I want to continue with your phone calls.
[02:06:55.823 --> 02:07:00.347]  I want to go right to your phone calls.
[02:07:00.347 --> 02:07:05.251]  I'm surprised some callers haven't brought up how the whole Russia narrative is completely collapsed and then boomerang back.
[02:07:06.178 --> 02:07:10.539]  And the mainstream media is trying to ignore it.
[02:07:10.539 --> 02:07:13.179]  It's just crazy.
[02:07:13.179 --> 02:07:17.340]  But again, the left is the outside globalist force.
[02:07:17.340 --> 02:07:23.341]  So they, the social engineers, want to tell you that you are with the outside force to turn you into the enemy.
[02:07:23.341 --> 02:07:26.242]  It's really amazingly simple.
[02:07:26.242 --> 02:07:32.863]  But if applied enough, and pushed enough, and bullied enough, they think you're going to finally roll over to them.
[02:07:35.168 --> 02:07:39.190]  Hen pecking only works if you're half awake or asleep.
[02:07:39.190 --> 02:07:41.130]  It doesn't work when you're aware of it.
[02:07:41.130 --> 02:07:47.893]  All it does is irritate you and get you more agitated and more awake.
[02:07:47.893 --> 02:07:50.794]  And now the grasping scum is so upset.
[02:07:52.499 --> 02:08:03.804]  All of the major combines, all the major media, all the major Hollywood outlets, all the major sports groups that are just nothing but vehicles to push globalist crap are falling apart.
[02:08:03.804 --> 02:08:05.185]  ESPN's laying off.
[02:08:06.243 --> 02:08:10.446]  Now it's up to like half their employees in the last two layoffs.
[02:08:10.446 --> 02:08:11.166]  Time Inc.
[02:08:11.166 --> 02:08:14.669]  is laying off half their employees after they laid off close to half a few years ago.
[02:08:14.669 --> 02:08:22.114]  I mean, it's beautiful to watch you filthy lying scum out on your traitorous butts on the streets.
[02:08:22.114 --> 02:08:24.555]  So just write more hate, more garbage.
[02:08:24.555 --> 02:08:25.856]  Just try to hold back America.
[02:08:25.856 --> 02:08:27.337]  Try to hold back the jobs.
[02:08:27.337 --> 02:08:28.558]  Try to destroy the Christians.
[02:08:28.558 --> 02:08:30.159]  Try to get race war going.
[02:08:30.159 --> 02:08:36.203]  Because the thinking people know you are the most lowdown, slimy, evil people the world
[02:08:37.043 --> 02:08:43.167]  And you hate us, and don't you worry, we just want to get you off our back.
[02:08:43.167 --> 02:08:46.209]  We don't even hate you, trash.
[02:08:46.209 --> 02:08:48.130]  We're just going away from you.
[02:08:48.130 --> 02:08:54.314]  And you're going to be left all alone with your own kind, you vampire trash.
[02:08:54.314 --> 02:09:02.218]  You nobodies, you little chicken-necked, spiritually dead losers.
[02:09:02.218 --> 02:09:03.979]  You think you're going to take us with you?
[02:09:03.979 --> 02:09:04.700]  Never.
[02:09:07.199 --> 02:09:07.980]  Never.
[02:09:07.980 --> 02:09:10.762]  You didn't break our will, you only ignited our will.
[02:09:10.762 --> 02:09:20.309]  And I've sworn on the altar of God, eternal resistance over every mind of tyranny, over the mind of humanity.
[02:09:20.309 --> 02:09:26.553]  I have sworn on the altar of God, eternal resistance to every form of tyranny over the mind of man.
[02:09:26.553 --> 02:09:29.396]  To quote Thomas Jefferson.
[02:09:29.396 --> 02:09:31.057]  I mean, can you imagine
[02:09:32.847 --> 02:09:35.488]  Taking communion with the globalists?
[02:09:35.488 --> 02:09:46.810]  Could you imagine being anti-human and wanting to screw people over and getting off on the fact that you know the fluoride and the vaccines lower IQs together by 30 points?
[02:09:46.810 --> 02:09:53.872]  And you look at how you've devastated the public and you find out leftist controllers all filter their water and never take vaccines.
[02:09:53.872 --> 02:09:56.492]  Look into it.
[02:09:56.492 --> 02:09:59.893]  And you just sit back and it is just mind-blowing.
[02:10:01.581 --> 02:10:06.468]  That they love walking around and seeing how hurt you are.
[02:10:06.468 --> 02:10:08.791]  It's their power!
[02:10:08.791 --> 02:10:13.358]  They're gonna brain damage you, they're gonna steal your mind, and they're gonna rule you!
[02:10:13.358 --> 02:10:17.644]  No, you're not, trash!
[02:10:21.547 --> 02:10:30.012]  And of course they howl back, we've already killed hundreds of millions, we've already diseased many more, and we're putting cancer viruses in, and look how many we already got!
[02:10:30.012 --> 02:10:34.515]  Oh, I know you already got a lot of people, but your time's running out.
[02:10:34.515 --> 02:10:44.181]  So you sit there and you hunch over and hoard all the brain-dead people you got and all the victims, and you just sit there and you enjoy them while you're eating them.
[02:10:44.181 --> 02:10:45.282]  Spiritually.
[02:10:45.282 --> 02:10:47.063]  But know this.
[02:10:47.063 --> 02:10:50.365]  You are gonna go in that woodchipper.
[02:10:51.607 --> 02:10:53.889]  You are gonna go.
[02:10:53.889 --> 02:10:56.151]  You're gonna go into the hell you created.
[02:10:56.151 --> 02:10:56.812]  You understand that?
[02:10:56.812 --> 02:10:59.154]  You understand that?
[02:10:59.154 --> 02:11:00.796]  You're gonna get it.
[02:11:00.796 --> 02:11:02.898]  Everything you did to those kids, you're getting it a trillion times.
[02:11:02.898 --> 02:11:03.779]  You understand?
[02:11:03.779 --> 02:11:05.080]  You're gonna get it.
[02:11:05.080 --> 02:11:07.422]  You're gonna be with your kind forever.
[02:11:07.422 --> 02:11:11.326]  Can you imagine being in a spiritual system?
[02:11:11.326 --> 02:11:12.567]  Divorced from God.
[02:11:12.567 --> 02:11:13.528]  That's hell.
[02:11:13.528 --> 02:11:14.208]  Separate.
[02:11:14.208 --> 02:11:15.850]  No need to add the fire.
[02:11:15.850 --> 02:11:16.771]  You are
[02:11:18.647 --> 02:11:21.249]  Literal gates of hell trying to destroy everything.
[02:11:21.249 --> 02:11:22.350]  I mean, that's who they are!
[02:11:22.350 --> 02:11:26.813]  And I know I harp on this more and more, it's just, it's my own understanding.
[02:11:26.813 --> 02:11:32.837]  It's not just the top globalists that want to kill everybody.
[02:11:32.837 --> 02:11:34.518]  Just because they're so satanic and so evil.
[02:11:36.305 --> 02:11:43.849]  The average minion now, through the screen time, through the brainwashing, you're either getting more awake or more into this stuff.
[02:11:43.849 --> 02:11:46.691]  And their people now are like zombies.
[02:11:46.691 --> 02:11:53.794]  I go out, I've shown you the video, and they can't talk, and they all look like zombies, and they all look like this.
[02:11:53.794 --> 02:11:55.155]  If you're a radio listener, I'll try to describe it.
[02:11:55.155 --> 02:12:01.118]  It's like a... RACIST SCAR!
[02:12:01.118 --> 02:12:02.239]  And that's the minions!
[02:12:05.356 --> 02:12:11.582]  The minions don't even, like, know who they are, and are just like, like their soul's gone.
[02:12:11.582 --> 02:12:12.383]  And they just can't even talk.
[02:12:12.383 --> 02:12:16.186]  They're like, uh, you're the enemy, you're the bad thing!
[02:12:16.186 --> 02:12:23.953]  And then the controllers are kind of... I mean, that's what it's like, whoa, these are some freaks, man!
[02:12:23.953 --> 02:12:27.096]  I mean, they're inherently evil.
[02:12:27.096 --> 02:12:27.977]  That's what I'm telling you.
[02:12:27.977 --> 02:12:29.138]  And they know they are!
[02:12:29.138 --> 02:12:30.860]  They will tell you they are!
[02:12:32.406 --> 02:12:35.868]  It can be women in business suits, or it can be women in anti-fuck outfits.
[02:12:35.868 --> 02:12:40.931]  I've got them at the state capitol, and I've got them on the ground in Austin, different groups, and they all have the same.
[02:12:40.931 --> 02:12:44.953]  They start smiling, and the women start licking their lips, and going, ah, it's a spirit.
[02:12:44.953 --> 02:12:51.337]  They go, I kill my kids, and I love Satan, and I'm gonna make myself ugly, and I stink, and I'm gonna pull down women.
[02:12:51.337 --> 02:12:54.919]  And you're like, it's a demon going, you're like, wow!
[02:12:54.919 --> 02:12:57.380]  And then you walk around the street, and there's another one, and another woman goes, ah!
[02:12:57.620 --> 02:12:59.661]  We're gonna destroy everything!
[02:12:59.661 --> 02:13:00.562]  You can't stop us!
[02:13:00.562 --> 02:13:01.262]  What the?
[02:13:01.262 --> 02:13:03.044]  What's going on, man?
[02:13:03.044 --> 02:13:07.266]  They got space aliens paratrooping out of some other dimension into these people's brains?
[02:13:07.266 --> 02:13:09.047]  I don't know.
[02:13:09.047 --> 02:13:12.289]  I'm not saying that, but we've all experienced it.
[02:13:12.289 --> 02:13:14.551]  They are dialed in, man.
[02:13:14.551 --> 02:13:16.532]  They're not home.
[02:13:16.532 --> 02:13:17.693]  And it's like a video game.
[02:13:17.693 --> 02:13:19.074]  It's like, okay, I know that model.
[02:13:21.135 --> 02:13:22.216]  And even how they're looking.
[02:13:22.216 --> 02:13:24.116]  Okay, then they'll spout what you know they're gonna spout.
[02:13:24.116 --> 02:13:25.357]  Just how they look!
[02:13:25.357 --> 02:13:28.538]  You know what it says!
[02:13:28.538 --> 02:13:30.699]  Talk about profiling!
[02:13:30.699 --> 02:13:34.520]  And man, in Seattle, they were dialed in, man.
[02:13:34.520 --> 02:13:41.403]  They were like, pull a string, and you know, they say these insults.
[02:13:41.403 --> 02:13:46.665]  And they jibber, and they hop around, and I mean, all they're missing is green tails.
[02:13:49.642 --> 02:13:55.023]  In fact, can we get the chirping goblin audio, actually, the one that has the cussing bleep, and the one with the golf cart?
[02:13:55.023 --> 02:13:59.164]  Because I want to play chirping goblin when we come back, then I'll go to your calls.
[02:13:59.164 --> 02:14:00.464]  I'm not trying to put the people down.
[02:14:00.464 --> 02:14:02.065]  They're gone.
[02:14:02.065 --> 02:14:05.586]  They're gone.
[02:14:05.586 --> 02:14:08.266]  And they're slaves, too.
[02:14:08.266 --> 02:14:14.588]  You could invite... I tried to get that goblin on, and he refused to come on.
[02:14:14.588 --> 02:14:16.028]  I even offered him money, and he wouldn't come on.
[02:14:16.960 --> 02:14:18.481]  Because it's like he can't.
[02:14:18.481 --> 02:14:20.823]  The spirit won't let him.
[02:14:20.823 --> 02:14:25.347]  Those kind of guys can't even talk, okay, until they like get activated.
[02:14:25.347 --> 02:14:30.972]  Then they just go, I mean, and so you're like, whoa, whoa.
[02:14:30.972 --> 02:14:33.134]  I'm telling you, man, something's going on here.
[02:14:33.134 --> 02:14:34.476]  And everybody's really noticing it.
[02:14:34.476 --> 02:14:36.657]  It's like people are acting like demons.
[02:14:41.869 --> 02:14:43.390]  You realize that's who they are?
[02:14:43.390 --> 02:14:44.751]  God Almighty.
[02:14:44.751 --> 02:14:47.053]  God Almighty.
[02:14:47.053 --> 02:14:53.538]  I'm gonna go to break, come back, go right to your calls, but just look at this article.
[02:14:53.538 --> 02:14:54.779]  And I see these things every day.
[02:14:54.779 --> 02:14:56.640]  This is out of Reuters.
[02:14:56.640 --> 02:15:00.223]  Because see, there's such a thing as traveling murderers.
[02:15:01.786 --> 02:15:05.750]  Who was the famous guy from Mexico that killed like 30-something people that they know of?
[02:15:05.750 --> 02:15:06.891]  Probably killed a hundred more.
[02:15:06.891 --> 02:15:08.932]  He may be the biggest serial killer in US history.
[02:15:08.932 --> 02:15:11.335]  And they just kept releasing him even though he was known to commit murders.
[02:15:11.335 --> 02:15:13.156]  Well, you're Hispanic, so you're allowed to go.
[02:15:13.156 --> 02:15:19.902]  Because that would be racist if we kept a serial killer in jail who actually mainly kills Hispanics.
[02:15:19.902 --> 02:15:22.084]  And it says, Pakistan migrant.
[02:15:22.084 --> 02:15:25.628]  He's just a migrant.
[02:15:25.628 --> 02:15:26.829]  Wanted for 70 murders.
[02:15:28.698 --> 02:15:30.119]  Arrested at the EU border.
[02:15:30.119 --> 02:15:31.200]  They think there's hundreds more.
[02:15:31.200 --> 02:15:32.941]  He's called the Butcher.
[02:15:32.941 --> 02:15:34.822]  Maybe they can rehabilitate him.
[02:15:34.822 --> 02:15:36.543]  Stay with us.
[02:15:36.543 --> 02:15:43.647]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are in the resistance.

[02:16:04.259 --> 02:16:12.627]  Loss of energy, blood sugar spikes and drops, poor circulation, and irregular heartbeat are just a few of these that can alert you that something is wrong.

[02:19:01.150 --> 02:19:10.002]  I'm going to have to end even sooner our Caveman Ultimate Paleo Bone Broth, Turmeric, Chaga Mushroom, Bee Pollen, and more.
[02:19:10.002 --> 02:19:10.663]  Concentrate.
[02:19:10.663 --> 02:19:12.445]  You talk about next level meal replacement.
[02:19:12.705 --> 02:19:16.387]  Next level compared to whey, and it's great to mix with whey and then make shakes.
[02:19:16.387 --> 02:19:17.727]  It's incredible.
[02:19:17.727 --> 02:19:19.648]  My son is growing like a weed using it.
[02:19:19.648 --> 02:19:21.789]  It's bigger than I am already.
[02:19:21.789 --> 02:19:22.650]  15, incredible.
[02:19:22.650 --> 02:19:23.890]  It is amazing.

[02:19:29.873 --> 02:19:32.635]  And folks, the globalists hate it when you do this.
[02:19:32.635 --> 02:19:38.238]  We're the tip of the spear because we're fearless, we're bold, because we understand the stakes are too high.
[02:19:38.238 --> 02:19:39.859]  The globalists win, we're all slaves.
[02:19:39.859 --> 02:19:41.440]  So don't thank me for what I'm doing.
[02:19:41.440 --> 02:19:42.561]  I want to thank you.
[02:19:42.561 --> 02:19:44.142]  We're all in this together.
[02:19:44.142 --> 02:19:49.906]  And when you get the great Bolan Lambe t-shirts, you get the great books and videos, you're fighting the tip of the spear.

[02:20:06.483 --> 02:20:11.048]  I don't want to see him kissing goblins.
[02:20:11.048 --> 02:20:12.569]  Engraving goblins.
[02:20:12.569 --> 02:20:14.291]  In bed with a goblin.
[02:20:14.291 --> 02:20:16.352]  I don't want to see him kissing goblins.
[02:20:16.352 --> 02:20:17.634]  Succubus goblins.
[02:20:17.634 --> 02:20:18.655]  Engraving goblins.
[02:20:30.871 --> 02:20:31.952]  Kissing goblins.
[02:20:31.952 --> 02:20:35.655]  Shitting goblins.
[02:20:35.655 --> 02:20:38.077]  Bad for the goblin.
[02:20:38.077 --> 02:20:38.598]  Dump it.
[02:20:38.598 --> 02:20:40.439]  Charging into a goblin's nest.
[02:20:40.439 --> 02:20:41.460]  Goblin vomit.
[02:20:41.460 --> 02:20:42.861]  Swap and run on it.
[02:20:42.861 --> 02:20:45.744]  Especially up to its ankles.
[02:20:45.744 --> 02:20:48.226]  Front charging into a goblin's nest.
[02:20:48.226 --> 02:20:48.926]  Goblin vomit.
[02:20:48.926 --> 02:20:49.287]  Swap.
[02:20:49.287 --> 02:20:49.887]  Goblin vomit.
[02:20:49.887 --> 02:20:50.127]  Swap.
[02:20:50.127 --> 02:20:54.171]  I'm not expecting you to not get a dirty swap.
[02:20:54.171 --> 02:20:55.352]  Kissing goblins.
[02:20:55.352 --> 02:20:56.613]  Shitting goblins.
[02:21:25.765 --> 02:21:27.472]  That's Place, Boing!
[02:21:27.472 --> 02:21:29.360]  That video got seen tens of millions of times.
[02:21:31.061 --> 02:21:33.722]  On Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube.
[02:21:33.722 --> 02:21:36.062]  And so it is, it is close to Halloween.
[02:21:36.062 --> 02:21:39.183]  The left wants to ban that now, because it's not satanic enough for them.
[02:21:39.183 --> 02:21:41.123]  And people dress up in different outfits and things.
[02:21:41.123 --> 02:21:44.764]  You can't have free expression, because liberals are against free expression.
[02:21:44.764 --> 02:21:48.785]  And even the theater now, and even Shakespeare, and even mathematics are saying ban it all.
[02:21:48.785 --> 02:21:52.746]  I have the articles right here, mainstream news, with straight faces are saying this.
[02:21:52.746 --> 02:21:54.186]  You go, that sounds insane.
[02:21:54.186 --> 02:21:55.867]  That sounds like a cult.
[02:21:55.867 --> 02:21:56.587]  That's what it is.
[02:21:57.503 --> 02:22:01.795]  Where you dress and talk like they say, and it may change on a week-to-week basis, it doesn't matter.
[02:22:01.795 --> 02:22:03.499]  You do that or you're not part of the cool club.
[02:22:04.966 --> 02:22:13.988]  of mental patients that are used and controlled and statistically are very poor and statistically very depressed and Facebook documents show they try to artificially keep you depressed so they can control you.
[02:22:13.988 --> 02:22:19.030]  I'm gonna go to AJ and Steve and Jeffrey and Kevin have been holding patiently here in a moment.
[02:22:19.030 --> 02:22:31.613]  But first, here is literal video, since Halloween's almost here, Samhain, All Saints Day, I guess you got Day of the Dead as well down in Mexico.
[02:22:32.472 --> 02:22:43.986]  Point is, it's a fall festival, and so here is a literal goblin videotaped by Michael Zimmerman that attacked me because I attempted to speak to it when I was screaming F you.
[02:22:43.986 --> 02:22:45.268]  This is a goblin that attacked me.
[02:22:45.268 --> 02:22:46.729]  These are real gibbering noises.
[02:22:46.729 --> 02:22:46.950]  Listen.
[02:22:48.530 --> 02:22:49.911]  You're trash!
[02:22:49.911 --> 02:22:50.031]  Hey!
[02:22:50.031 --> 02:22:51.431]  Don't tell me on camera!
[02:22:51.431 --> 02:22:52.832]  Don't tell me on camera!
[02:22:52.832 --> 02:22:54.313]  Don't tell me on camera!
[02:22:54.313 --> 02:22:55.053]  Come here, talent!
[02:22:55.053 --> 02:22:56.434]  Come here, talent!
[02:22:56.434 --> 02:22:57.814]  On your own camera!
[02:22:57.814 --> 02:22:58.695]  Right here!
[02:22:58.695 --> 02:23:01.396]  Tell people intellectually who you are!
[02:23:01.396 --> 02:23:02.237]  Intellectually who I am?
[02:23:02.237 --> 02:23:02.617]  Go ahead, yeah!
[02:23:09.417 --> 02:23:10.778]  Yeah, I'm your mama.
[02:23:10.778 --> 02:23:12.559]  I'm your mama.
[02:23:12.559 --> 02:23:14.020]  Target is the mother.
[02:23:14.020 --> 02:23:15.901]  I want to let go.
[02:23:15.901 --> 02:23:17.122]  Target is your mother.
[02:23:17.122 --> 02:23:18.222]  Target is mine.
[02:23:18.222 --> 02:23:22.565]  This is what they target people into.
[02:23:22.565 --> 02:23:23.545]  This is it right here.
[02:23:23.545 --> 02:23:26.247]  I believe it's angry.
[02:23:26.247 --> 02:23:28.368]  You can't even talk, look at you.
[02:23:28.368 --> 02:23:30.810]  He's got his bad breath again.
[02:23:30.810 --> 02:23:34.972]  Love's so hard to find.
[02:23:34.972 --> 02:23:36.233]  Literal slave of the system.
[02:23:37.088 --> 02:23:37.989]  See that?
[02:23:37.989 --> 02:23:39.370]  That's who they are!
[02:23:39.370 --> 02:23:44.556]  Look at the slate!
[02:23:44.556 --> 02:23:53.104]  Alright, back to your phone calls.
[02:23:53.104 --> 02:23:54.746]  Let's talk to AJ in Ohio.
[02:23:54.746 --> 02:23:55.987]  Thanks for holding AJ, you're on the air.
[02:23:55.987 --> 02:23:59.191]  Hey, what's going on, Alex?
[02:23:59.191 --> 02:23:59.671]  Good, brother.
[02:23:59.671 --> 02:24:00.272]  Thanks for calling.
[02:24:01.078 --> 02:24:01.658]  Hey, not a problem.
[02:24:01.658 --> 02:24:03.039]  Thanks for taking the call.
[02:24:03.039 --> 02:24:08.923]  Now, you know, we can't say goblin anymore because that's this week's racial slur that we're not allowed to say anymore.
[02:24:08.923 --> 02:24:10.904]  They'll probably start saying we're not supposed to use it.
[02:24:10.904 --> 02:24:14.986]  But, you know, again, they're trying to territorialize all information saying it's racist.
[02:24:14.986 --> 02:24:17.568]  So you can only use information that they approve.
[02:24:17.568 --> 02:24:21.210]  I mean, this is a dysfunctional group of mental patients.
[02:24:21.210 --> 02:24:23.712]  They were supposed to put their dysfunction into us to bring us all down.
[02:24:23.712 --> 02:24:27.314]  Instead, we've contained it on the universities and in the corporations.
[02:24:27.314 --> 02:24:28.355]  And that's why they're all failing.
[02:24:28.355 --> 02:24:28.855]  Isn't it beautiful?
[02:24:30.024 --> 02:24:30.805]  Oh yeah, definitely.
[02:24:30.805 --> 02:24:45.115]  I'm telling you right now, I'm a truck driver for my occupation, and the biggest fear I had coming out of this election was, yeah, people are awake for the election, but my biggest fear was people were going to go back to their safe zones and realize, okay, we won this one, you know, let's take a breath.
[02:24:45.115 --> 02:24:48.037]  And you can't take a breath when you're dealing with these type of people.
[02:24:48.037 --> 02:24:49.158]  You gotta stay on them.
[02:24:49.577 --> 02:24:52.661]  And by the way, when you always demand delivery from a person driving a truck,
[02:25:05.393 --> 02:25:10.718]  Then you're going to keep people out there and people need to know how to drive a truck or need to not just have a calculator.
[02:25:10.718 --> 02:25:11.859]  It's dehumanizing us.
[02:25:11.859 --> 02:25:20.187]  We need, not because computers are bad, the globalists are designing it to displace us so governments can dictate our surrender.
[02:25:20.187 --> 02:25:28.656]  We must continue to support real farmers and support real truck drivers and real soldiers because this automation will be the undoing of us.
[02:25:29.687 --> 02:25:41.619]  That is correct, and definitely when I saw your ad with that bot, I think it was yesterday you guys were talking about it, the crazy Dubai robot or whatever that's going on.
[02:25:41.619 --> 02:25:49.146]  Mix that with, now I guess over in Germany, Mercedes-Benz is coming out with an all-purpose semi-truck, and I'm like, you're still going to need somebody to back in.
[02:25:49.146 --> 02:25:54.211]  You're still going to have somebody have to unload it, and it just cracks me up that they think that they can push this narrative.
[02:25:54.671 --> 02:25:58.432]  And, you know, basically cut out all the good paying jobs for the middle class.
[02:26:10.925 --> 02:26:12.127]  Why the future doesn't need us?
[02:26:12.127 --> 02:26:22.944]  We need to say we're going to, with our human choices, build a world where a bunch of delusional-thinking-they're-God tech giants don't make us obsolete.
[02:26:22.944 --> 02:26:24.607]  We're going to make them obsolete.
[02:26:24.607 --> 02:26:25.849]  They've declared war on us.
[02:26:26.109 --> 02:26:28.150]  They're using computers and robots to do it.
[02:26:28.150 --> 02:26:33.434]  Let's take control of the machines and the technology and use it against them, just like the Internet, and we're going to win.
[02:26:33.434 --> 02:26:42.080]  If we're conscious of it and make decisions every day, financially and in other ways, that support human liberty, we are unstoppable if we launch operations now.
[02:26:43.473 --> 02:26:44.654]  Exactly.
[02:26:44.654 --> 02:26:56.345]  The last thing I wanted to leave you with, Alex, was I wanted to thank you for taking the blinders off me, so to speak, because coming out of the military, your Piers Morgan debate that you're very famous for, that was kind of what woke me up.
[02:26:56.345 --> 02:27:01.730]  I'm like, wow, this guy, I finally got an advocate that can speak for me, that has the platform to speak for me.
[02:27:01.730 --> 02:27:04.052]  So you guys keep up the great work, brother, and you guys have a good one.
[02:27:04.192 --> 02:27:04.853]  Well, God bless you.
[02:27:04.853 --> 02:27:16.629]  Let me say, you speak well for yourself and that's why all the humble men like yourself need to start a YouTube channel or a Facebook channel so they can't censor us all and just put out the info and your common sense.
[02:27:16.629 --> 02:27:18.011]  Don't count on me.
[02:27:18.011 --> 02:27:19.153]  Make me obsolete.
[02:27:19.153 --> 02:27:21.055]  Let me tell you how you make Alex Jones obsolete.
[02:27:21.952 --> 02:27:35.484]  All of you start radio shows, start YouTube, start blog talk radio, whatever, start local access, start a local newspaper, call into C-SPAN, whatever you do, everybody starts communicating like you just did.
[02:27:35.484 --> 02:27:38.106]  We are unstoppable.
[02:27:38.106 --> 02:27:39.427]  Let's jam in one more call here.
[02:27:39.427 --> 02:27:40.588]  Stephen Montana, you're on the air.
[02:27:40.588 --> 02:27:49.956]  This is deplorable Stephen Montana and I wanted to let you know Alex, thank you, and I'll make it quick, you don't have to respond, but Americans are getting mad as hell.
[02:27:50.535 --> 02:27:55.237]  And I talk to people and the best way of communication is communicating.
[02:27:55.237 --> 02:27:56.197]  And that's one-on-one.
[02:27:56.197 --> 02:27:58.718]  I was talking to a guy yesterday, same way.
[02:27:58.718 --> 02:28:01.279]  And, you know, Americans aren't going to take it anymore.
[02:28:01.279 --> 02:28:06.021]  And the biggest thing I'm hearing is the crooks need to go to jail.
[02:28:06.021 --> 02:28:10.463]  And basically, yes, the Kennedy file should be released now to protect Trump.
[02:28:11.132 --> 02:28:15.216]  Because if he gets into those, they're protecting themselves and trying to keep their jobs.
[02:28:15.216 --> 02:28:16.818]  They need to be unemployed.
[02:28:16.818 --> 02:28:18.519]  You know what he's doing to the Deep State?
[02:28:18.519 --> 02:28:19.440]  He knows what's in there.
[02:28:19.440 --> 02:28:20.702]  It's the Bushes.
[02:28:20.702 --> 02:28:21.783]  It's all of them in there.
[02:28:21.783 --> 02:28:22.724]  And these are real files.
[02:28:22.724 --> 02:28:24.085]  That's why they're so scared.
[02:28:24.085 --> 02:28:29.851]  And I think he's probably using this the next 60 days to broker some deals with the Deep State behind the scenes.
[02:28:29.851 --> 02:28:31.673]  But I think they'll stab him in the back and kill him.
[02:28:32.233 --> 02:28:36.777]  I mean, let me tell you, this is full-on globalist warfare right now.
[02:28:36.777 --> 02:28:37.758]  Could be a crazier time.
[02:28:37.758 --> 02:28:38.378]  Stay there, Steve.
[02:28:38.378 --> 02:28:39.379]  I went to you later.
[02:28:39.379 --> 02:28:40.660]  We need to come back and finish up.
[02:28:40.660 --> 02:28:44.643]  Then Jeffrey, Kevin, and others, and then I got a bunch of news I haven't hit yet.

[02:31:57.185 --> 02:31:59.066]  You developed Living Defense for us.
[02:31:59.066 --> 02:32:00.387]  It took you over a year to do it.
[02:32:00.387 --> 02:32:01.608]  Why is this so good?
[02:32:01.608 --> 02:32:06.891]  Because people are actually waking up to the problem that pretty much scares me the most.
[02:32:06.891 --> 02:32:20.420]  I mean, I try to make sure that I don't put toxins from food and water and beverages in my system, but right now we're dealing with massive parasites, which is anything that's harmful to your body that lives off a host mechanism.
[02:32:20.420 --> 02:32:21.801]  Right now with all the refugees,
[02:32:22.581 --> 02:32:24.222]  Uh, spreading disease around.
[02:32:24.222 --> 02:32:26.783]  We have biological warfare going on everywhere.
[02:32:26.783 --> 02:32:28.083]  These are all parasites.
[02:32:28.083 --> 02:32:29.204]  Tell us about all the stuff that's in it.
[02:32:29.204 --> 02:32:30.544]  There's so many things that are in it.
[02:32:30.544 --> 02:32:35.026]  You have the neem in there, you have the organic clove bud, the organic wormwood.
[02:32:35.026 --> 02:32:38.308]  I recommend doing a parasite cleanse at least twice a year.
[02:32:38.308 --> 02:32:41.389]  All right, well, I'm glad we've got some back in because I'm going back on it today.
[02:32:41.389 --> 02:32:42.429]  It just came back in yesterday.
[02:32:42.429 --> 02:32:44.350]  LivingDefense, InfowarsLife.com.
[02:32:44.350 --> 02:32:45.371]  And folks, you can't lose.
[02:32:45.371 --> 02:32:48.092]  It's full of stuff that's great for your body, period.
[02:32:48.092 --> 02:32:48.292]  And, uh,
[02:32:48.972 --> 02:32:49.993]  You support the broadcast.
[02:32:49.993 --> 02:32:51.333]  Infowarslives.com.
[02:32:51.333 --> 02:32:53.574]  Thank you Dr. Group from the Global Healing Center.
[02:32:53.574 --> 02:32:57.897]  Thank you so much for all your work sir on this great product.
[02:32:57.897 --> 02:33:00.498]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[02:33:17.083 --> 02:33:21.408]  You are listening to an InfoWars.com Frontline Report.
[02:33:21.408 --> 02:33:30.438]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[02:33:30.438 --> 02:33:33.782]  We're back live, going right back to your phone calls.
[02:33:33.782 --> 02:33:37.987]  Steven Montana, Jeffrey, Kevin, Jason, Alex, John, we're gonna go to all of you.
[02:33:40.384 --> 02:33:55.273]  But every day, I see 5, 6, 7, 8 news articles reporting with straight faces that Yale looks to stop teaching the classics in English because, well, the classics are racist.
[02:33:55.273 --> 02:33:57.654]  Shakespeare, you name it.
[02:33:57.654 --> 02:34:03.677]  Or, mathematics is racist and needs to not be taught.
[02:34:03.677 --> 02:34:05.759]  I mean, they're politicizing everything
[02:34:06.693 --> 02:34:09.658]  It's completely insane by design.
[02:34:09.658 --> 02:34:12.322]  And now any old statues are being attacked.
[02:34:12.322 --> 02:34:15.306]  Teddy Roosevelt attacked at Museum of Natural History.
[02:34:15.306 --> 02:34:17.269]  People, you know, saying he's a racist, take him down.
[02:34:17.269 --> 02:34:18.872]  They don't even know who they're going after.
[02:34:18.872 --> 02:34:20.454]  And here is The Chronicle.
[02:34:21.598 --> 02:34:39.262]  This is owned by the folks that own South by Southwest, that giant nerd fest where they try to lure in all the little desperate nobodies and trendies who hope they're going to get a job or, you know, become successful somehow with the big tech giants and the rest of it, and Hollywood and its invasion of Texas.
[02:34:39.262 --> 02:34:42.582]  But they have a Halloween mask that's the cover.
[02:34:42.582 --> 02:34:44.763]  Armed white male!
[02:34:44.763 --> 02:34:48.223]  And he's pointing a rifle at you that has two scopes.
[02:34:52.435 --> 02:34:55.696]  Talk about the ignorant weirdo that doesn't know anything about guns.
[02:34:55.696 --> 02:35:02.177]  I guess they think it's like a telescope, where you've got a spotting scope, and then the telescope itself, that's not on guns.
[02:35:02.177 --> 02:35:03.058]  That's on telescopes.
[02:35:03.058 --> 02:35:16.141]  So, just the total ignorance, and then it's a white man with blonde hair and an evil blue eye, and you see this in Hollywood and the culture, and then you've got everybody saying, Russian scum!
[02:35:16.141 --> 02:35:18.161]  The Russians as a people are evil!
[02:35:18.161 --> 02:35:19.282]  They control our election!
[02:35:19.282 --> 02:35:20.642]  Meanwhile, it's Russia paying off Hillary.
[02:35:22.898 --> 02:35:37.923]  And they're just so proud of the provocativeness of trying to incite minority groups into their anti-white race cult that's being directed by a bunch of old hunchback liberals.
[02:35:37.923 --> 02:35:44.045]  Like the guy, he's got a fake name, Louis Black, forget his real name, that owns the Chronicle.
[02:35:44.045 --> 02:35:47.206]  I mean, it's just an assault and it's everywhere.
[02:35:47.206 --> 02:35:50.867]  We're just waiting in it.
[02:35:50.867 --> 02:35:52.168]  We're just waiting in
[02:35:53.867 --> 02:35:55.148]  Here's the thing.
[02:35:55.148 --> 02:36:04.877]  They may have their big nerd fest, South by Southwest, that is somewhat successful, though they say it's becoming more unpopular because it's just disintegrating.
[02:36:04.877 --> 02:36:07.519]  The Chronicle itself is a joke that nobody reads.
[02:36:07.519 --> 02:36:13.504]  And of course, this Louis Black guy has for years been writing lies about me and always trying to get me off the air, how I'm dangerous.
[02:36:13.504 --> 02:36:14.545]  I mean, give me a break, man.
[02:36:14.545 --> 02:36:18.449]  I mean, you talk about a weevil.
[02:36:18.449 --> 02:36:21.031]  You talk about everything we talk about that's wrong with this country.
[02:36:24.420 --> 02:36:29.863]  I just love watching Hollywood and the NFL and all these people just sink into the mud.
[02:36:29.863 --> 02:36:32.664]  Just look at that race baiting.
[02:36:32.664 --> 02:36:34.545]  Armed white male.
[02:36:34.545 --> 02:36:37.567]  You're an effing white male, says Aide Skrielich.
[02:36:41.997 --> 02:36:47.800]  So when you spread our links, you spread our articles, when you buy our products, it is an act of resistance to these people.
[02:36:47.800 --> 02:36:50.121]  And I know you're not sneaking to their level.
[02:36:50.121 --> 02:36:52.002]  Our audience is incredibly diverse.
[02:36:52.002 --> 02:36:55.724]  This is meant to divide this country along racial lines.
[02:36:55.724 --> 02:37:02.308]  They know Christians and they know conservatives and they know people fought hard in the West in slavery.
[02:37:02.308 --> 02:37:10.212]  They hope the public doesn't read history so they can find out the West actually made the first moves to abolish slavery and to empower women.
[02:37:11.496 --> 02:37:24.446]  They're bringing in a new form of corporate oppression and they want to attack all that's old because what's old was the Renaissance trying to be pure, trying to not be barbarous, trying to be good, trying to grow a middle class.
[02:37:24.446 --> 02:37:28.769]  Now it grew such successful empires that they ended up taking over the world.
[02:37:28.769 --> 02:37:37.976]  But just because it empowered more people than any other group didn't mean we were perfect, didn't mean we didn't have big problems, but the experiment worked so well it displaced the other tyrannies.
[02:37:38.871 --> 02:37:40.351]  And it was a lesser tyranny.
[02:37:40.351 --> 02:37:53.196]  Now evil corporate control groups have gained control of the West, and have used it to dominate the world, and then they turn around now to inflict the race-based cult.
[02:37:53.196 --> 02:38:00.678]  Now that the country is more than half non-white, and it's going to accelerate, they want to flip the script, just like the Democrats always do, and have race-based systems.
[02:38:00.678 --> 02:38:03.639]  And remember, they know what they're doing.
[02:38:05.765 --> 02:38:10.308]  They know what they're invoking, and the good news is, they're failing.
[02:38:10.308 --> 02:38:12.330]  Louis Black is a failure.
[02:38:12.330 --> 02:38:19.255]  And all of his other cohorts, like Stephen Colbert, you know, the whole Russiagate thing, you've been proven to be the fraud.
[02:38:19.255 --> 02:38:20.336]  You're the joke.
[02:38:20.336 --> 02:38:23.999]  You're the political bankrupt group that claimed it controlled America's culture.
[02:38:23.999 --> 02:38:26.221]  We just ignored you.
[02:38:26.221 --> 02:38:30.644]  Now you've taken over academia and everything else, and you're showing us, hey, I'm the boss!
[02:38:30.644 --> 02:38:31.605]  I'm gonna run your life!
[02:38:33.174 --> 02:38:34.455]  People are actually like, really?
[02:38:34.455 --> 02:38:35.877]  Get off my back.
[02:38:35.877 --> 02:38:37.078]  We tolerated you.
[02:38:37.078 --> 02:38:38.119]  You're intolerant.
[02:38:38.119 --> 02:38:42.102]  We're done with you.
[02:38:42.102 --> 02:38:42.703]  It's amazing.
[02:38:42.703 --> 02:38:46.446]  And they're out to destroy us, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:38:46.446 --> 02:38:48.228]  I've had law firms look at it.
[02:38:48.228 --> 02:38:51.791]  I'm not ready to talk about it yet.
[02:38:51.791 --> 02:38:55.755]  But I have hired the top law firm in the country that's been successful more than any other group.
[02:38:56.880 --> 02:39:07.445]  And we did see a notice in the letters today about what you've seen in the news, trying to destroy InfoWars and company with defamation, slander, libel.
[02:39:07.445 --> 02:39:13.088]  It's a very strong case and I need your support.
[02:39:13.088 --> 02:39:15.890]  I've told everybody, I've been warning all these people.
[02:39:15.890 --> 02:39:18.091]  I'm very close to filing suit on Tom Brokaw.
[02:39:18.091 --> 02:39:19.532]  He's not reversed himself and others.
[02:39:22.958 --> 02:39:29.361]  I'm not a litigious person, but I've got to strike back against these people, because if they can bully me out of existence, they can bully you out of existence.
[02:39:29.361 --> 02:39:37.985]  But all you've got to do is decide to go to Infowarsstore.com and to buy the products that are great, high quality, water filtration supplements.
[02:39:37.985 --> 02:39:43.587]  The new Antifa t-shirt we've got that looks like the Antifa t-shirt, but says anti-fascist, anti-communist.
[02:39:43.587 --> 02:39:45.948]  Infowars.com with the Gadsden flag, the American flag.
[02:39:45.948 --> 02:39:48.810]  It's beautiful.
[02:39:48.810 --> 02:39:50.390]  We're selling it, ladies and gentlemen, for $13.
[02:39:53.372 --> 02:39:53.492]  $13.95.
[02:39:53.492 --> 02:39:53.813]  Okay.
[02:39:53.813 --> 02:39:58.616]  I mean, I want to sell these.
[02:39:58.616 --> 02:40:02.138]  I should be selling them for a hundred bucks, but then we could fund our operation.
[02:40:02.138 --> 02:40:04.740]  I know you'd buy them, but I like to sell at a very, very low price.
[02:40:04.740 --> 02:40:06.681]  A matching sticker.
[02:40:06.681 --> 02:40:11.664]  We're going to add some of the other InfoWar stickers into there and let's just all get more aggressive in the InfoWar.
[02:40:11.664 --> 02:40:13.886]  We're winning.
[02:40:13.886 --> 02:40:15.787]  So it's at InfoWarStore.com.
[02:40:15.787 --> 02:40:16.047]  Okay.
[02:40:16.047 --> 02:40:17.208]  I said, I'd go to your calls and I'm not.
[02:40:17.208 --> 02:40:18.149]  I'm a bad person.
[02:40:18.149 --> 02:40:19.549]  Steven Montana, you're making some great points.
[02:40:19.549 --> 02:40:20.130]  Go ahead and finish up.
[02:40:20.967 --> 02:40:22.187]  You bet, Alex.
[02:40:22.187 --> 02:40:26.229]  What I also want to say is, we got your back, Alex.
[02:40:26.229 --> 02:40:28.069]  Your listeners have your back.
[02:40:28.069 --> 02:40:31.450]  Don't worry about it.
[02:40:31.450 --> 02:40:40.213]  Getting back to what I wanted to call originally was, Roger and you were talking about how, I believe it was McMasters was talking about sending 50,000 troops to Afghanistan.
[02:40:40.213 --> 02:40:41.374]  That's a total exclusive, yeah.
[02:40:41.374 --> 02:40:41.934]  That's directly...
[02:40:43.561 --> 02:41:01.824]  Well, you gotta ask yourself why, and it hit me when I was looking at my view out Montana window, that they want to get our troops out of the country for, say, let's say November 4th, that our American troops wouldn't be here, and the soldiers who stand behind us, and who abide by the Constitution, and they want to put them out of the country.
[02:41:01.824 --> 02:41:08.505]  That's 40,000 of the best Trump supporters being put into that meat grinder.
[02:41:08.505 --> 02:41:12.926]  You know, and there's no reason for it, and Trump pulled the right thing on it, and I had to bring that up.
[02:41:13.413 --> 02:41:19.496]  Because there's no way that you would send out that kind of troops unless you had a major reason.
[02:41:19.496 --> 02:41:21.057]  Especially, we know we've already lost that.
[02:41:21.057 --> 02:41:22.798]  We haven't even won that war.
[02:41:22.798 --> 02:41:24.819]  You can't win when there's not a civilization.
[02:41:25.771 --> 02:41:27.712]  Let me tell you, the Afghans are weird, man.
[02:41:27.712 --> 02:41:30.494]  Did you know they have the highest per capita of trannies?
[02:41:30.494 --> 02:41:40.541]  And I'm not, not, I mean, people want to, they make these young men that aren't masculine be women, and then they have sex with them, and then they have like brothels up in the hills that, where it's men you have sex with.
[02:41:40.541 --> 02:41:44.043]  Man, let me tell you, these are some weirdos, okay?
[02:41:44.043 --> 02:41:54.390]  And I mean, they all, they're like murdering, killing, don't care about dying, super brave, super crazy, and then half of them are,
[02:41:55.891 --> 02:41:56.871]  Or more gay.
[02:41:56.871 --> 02:41:58.712]  I mean, you just can't make this stuff up.
[02:41:58.712 --> 02:41:59.912]  Women got hoods over their heads.
[02:41:59.912 --> 02:42:02.152]  They throw acid on them if they talk back.
[02:42:02.152 --> 02:42:03.733]  The leftists all love it.
[02:42:03.733 --> 02:42:04.613]  A bunch of fruit lips.
[02:42:04.613 --> 02:42:06.093]  What do you make of that?
[02:42:06.093 --> 02:42:07.173]  Oh my God.
[02:42:07.173 --> 02:42:08.194]  It's crazy.
[02:42:08.194 --> 02:42:10.574]  Donald Trump's got to protect himself on that.
[02:42:10.574 --> 02:42:11.814]  They're going to try and pull that.
[02:42:11.814 --> 02:42:16.255]  And if they took out 50,000 troops out of our country, hey, those are our Americans.
[02:42:16.255 --> 02:42:18.716]  You know, we need to close the borders and keep the borders tight.
[02:42:19.218 --> 02:42:22.322]  We need to have people here to protect us as well as protect anywhere else.
[02:42:22.322 --> 02:42:22.762]  I agree.
[02:42:22.762 --> 02:42:25.205]  Afghanistan is a pedophile palace.
[02:42:25.205 --> 02:42:26.347]  They just put an article up about it.
[02:42:26.347 --> 02:42:27.368]  I'm not kidding, folks.
[02:42:27.368 --> 02:42:28.329]  You can't make this up.
[02:42:28.329 --> 02:42:34.096]  They force a large portion of the boys into sex servitude, but it's okay as long as they're boys.
[02:42:35.117 --> 02:42:38.320]  If a man has sex with a child, that's okay under Islam.
[02:42:38.320 --> 02:42:40.541]  Under their forms of it.
[02:42:40.541 --> 02:42:43.584]  But then once a man with another man, now that's punishable by death.
[02:42:43.584 --> 02:42:44.605]  Thank you, Steve Gray Points.
[02:42:44.605 --> 02:42:47.067]  I promise I'm going to all your calls next segment.
[02:42:47.067 --> 02:42:48.187]  Stay with us, I'm Alex Jones.
[02:42:48.187 --> 02:42:49.388]  I'm telling you, truth strangers than fiction.
[02:42:49.388 --> 02:42:50.810]  That's what the left likes.
[02:42:50.810 --> 02:42:51.650]  Radical Islam.
[02:42:51.650 --> 02:42:52.091]  You're pedophiles.
[02:42:54.560 --> 02:43:00.148]  We're not just going to have to end in the next week the Brain Force Plus special 50% off.
[02:43:00.148 --> 02:43:09.019]  I'm going to have to end even sooner our caveman ultimate paleo bone broth, turmeric, chaga mushroom, bee pollen, and more.
[02:43:09.019 --> 02:43:09.440]  Concentrate.
[02:43:09.480 --> 02:43:09.660]  Great.
[02:43:09.660 --> 02:43:11.702]  You talk about next level meal replacement.
[02:43:11.702 --> 02:43:13.344]  Next level compared to whey.
[02:43:13.344 --> 02:43:15.386]  And it's great to mix with whey and then make shakes.
[02:43:15.386 --> 02:43:16.728]  It's incredible.
[02:43:16.728 --> 02:43:18.910]  My son is growing like a weed using it.
[02:43:18.910 --> 02:43:20.812]  He's bigger than I am already.
[02:43:20.812 --> 02:43:20.872]  15.
[02:43:20.872 --> 02:43:21.653]  Incredible.
[02:43:21.653 --> 02:43:22.894]  It is amazing.

[02:43:28.880 --> 02:43:31.641]  And folks, the globalists hate it when you do this.
[02:43:31.641 --> 02:43:37.244]  We're the tip of the spear because we're fearless, we're bold, because we understand the stakes are too high.
[02:43:37.244 --> 02:43:38.864]  The globalists win, we're all slaves.
[02:43:38.864 --> 02:43:40.445]  So don't thank me for what I'm doing.
[02:43:40.445 --> 02:43:41.566]  I want to thank you.
[02:43:41.566 --> 02:43:42.626]  We're all in this together.

[02:46:51.565 --> 02:46:53.126]  That's InfoWarsLife.com
[02:47:22.573 --> 02:47:28.175]  Well, the Austin Chronicle has joined the rest of the big corporate media trying to create race war and division in America.
[02:47:28.175 --> 02:47:35.018]  It's in the WikiLeaks that they want culture war to control their slaves and to keep us desperate and alone, as Hillary writes in the emails.
[02:47:35.618 --> 02:47:36.660]  Facebook documents are out.
[02:47:36.660 --> 02:47:37.681]  They admit that's the agenda.
[02:47:37.681 --> 02:47:43.609]  And Louis Black, owner of the Chronicle, has done a great job staying with the elite agenda, trying to be part of their power structure.
[02:47:43.609 --> 02:47:47.334]  And he runs South by Southwest, so I say he's been rewarded nicely.
[02:47:47.334 --> 02:47:50.498]  And their new Halloween cover is armed white male.
[02:47:50.498 --> 02:47:53.021]  And it's supposed to look like a police pop-up of a criminal.
[02:47:53.939 --> 02:47:58.421]  In fact, that's what it imitates, is the image of a criminal that pops up in a shooting range for police.
[02:47:58.421 --> 02:48:03.762]  The subliminal and overt message is, white men are terrorists, they're criminals, they're the bad guys.
[02:48:03.762 --> 02:48:09.224]  And then you read, they've got an issue in there about the problem of the effing white males.
[02:48:09.224 --> 02:48:12.685]  And the problem of the Russian scum.
[02:48:12.685 --> 02:48:13.846]  What they really mean is Christian.
[02:48:15.080 --> 02:48:16.281]  And they just want to divide everybody.
[02:48:16.281 --> 02:48:17.442]  It's truly sick.
[02:48:17.442 --> 02:48:18.322]  It's truly evil.
[02:48:18.322 --> 02:48:20.083]  I'm going to your calls here in a moment.
[02:48:20.083 --> 02:48:24.066]  But first, this is evidence of rats leaving the sinking ship.
[02:48:24.066 --> 02:48:26.468]  This is big, big news.
[02:48:26.468 --> 02:48:35.774]  Mr. Panetta, former head of the CIA under Obama, has said that the dossier needs to be criminally investigated.
[02:48:36.744 --> 02:48:42.087]  It does violate campaign finance law, and it was an attempt to manipulate our elections with fraud.
[02:48:42.087 --> 02:48:46.929]  Everything they said was what Trump had done, it now turns out, is what they did.
[02:48:46.929 --> 02:48:55.373]  In fact, it's only Trump, pretty much, in the Republican and Democrat leadership, that wasn't on some type of Russian payroll.
[02:48:55.373 --> 02:48:58.175]  Mueller, McCain, all of them.
[02:48:59.442 --> 02:49:04.443]  The Russians wanted resources, and they were coming to town and buying, and it was illegal, but you know what?
[02:49:04.443 --> 02:49:05.243]  They did it!
[02:49:05.243 --> 02:49:07.704]  And so they were scared because Trump got in.
[02:49:07.704 --> 02:49:09.264]  What were they going to do?
[02:49:09.264 --> 02:49:10.725]  We've been doing all sorts of criminal stuff.
[02:49:10.725 --> 02:49:12.205]  Well, we'll just say he's a Russian.
[02:49:12.205 --> 02:49:12.925]  Yeah.
[02:49:12.925 --> 02:49:18.506]  Well, once his son was investigating us, so we'll say him investigating us is proof he's a Russian.
[02:49:18.506 --> 02:49:18.986]  Yeah!
[02:49:18.986 --> 02:49:20.167]  He's looking for Russian spies!
[02:49:20.167 --> 02:49:21.127]  That means he's a Russian!
[02:49:22.387 --> 02:49:24.628]  Yeah, and Alex Jones is one!
[02:49:24.628 --> 02:49:26.169]  And Tucker Carlson!
[02:49:26.169 --> 02:49:29.732]  Oh, and Lou Dobbs is one too, yeah!
[02:49:29.732 --> 02:49:32.673]  Yeah, don't trust us!
[02:49:32.673 --> 02:49:35.795]  So here's the clip of the rats leaving the sinking ship.
[02:49:35.795 --> 02:49:39.117]  On Monday, Drudge ran our big headline about the power structure.
[02:49:39.117 --> 02:49:44.981]  DrudgeReport.com now getting ready to throw the Clintons like Weinstein under the bus.
[02:49:44.981 --> 02:49:47.543]  Yeah, that's what's happening, so here's more evidence of that.
[02:49:48.345 --> 02:49:49.306]  So it's very awkward.
[02:49:49.306 --> 02:49:58.133]  How could both the chair of the DNC and the Clinton campaign not know about these payments?
[02:49:58.133 --> 02:50:04.358]  Well, it's obviously something that the Intelligence Committee is going to have to have to look at.
[02:50:04.358 --> 02:50:14.026]  You know, knowing presidential campaigns, they're big operations and somehow the left hand may not know what the right hand is doing.
[02:50:14.026 --> 02:50:15.428]  And that could be the case here.
[02:50:17.564 --> 02:50:23.933]  Oh, Hillary would never know that their main launch the last four months of the campaign would be that Trump was a Russian.
[02:50:23.933 --> 02:50:30.361]  She had nothing to do with the opposition research, or paying, or getting the FBI to put their signature on it, or buying it from Jeb Bush.
[02:50:32.597 --> 02:50:39.064]  And the big billionaire hedge fund conservative that they claim I get money from with no evidence, who's actually battling me.
[02:50:39.064 --> 02:50:45.071]  Of course, you've got the Republican power structure right in there, folks, with the Democrats, all part of this thing.
[02:50:45.071 --> 02:50:46.533]  And that's what we're trying to remove right now.
[02:50:46.533 --> 02:50:47.554]  Let's finish up with Panetta.
[02:50:51.061 --> 02:50:59.883]  I really do think that the committee is going to have to get into this, determine just exactly what happened, who knew what, and when.
[02:50:59.883 --> 02:51:09.806]  But if the lawyer who was representing the Democratic National Committee and the Clinton campaign, Mark Elias, is sitting next to John Podesta, he was asked, do you know about the funding?
[02:51:09.806 --> 02:51:10.626]  He says, no.
[02:51:10.626 --> 02:51:16.948]  Wouldn't it be his responsibility to at least whisper in his ear, yes, yes, and tell him what was going on?
[02:51:16.948 --> 02:51:18.968]  So if he wasn't lying, John Podesta,
[02:51:19.549 --> 02:51:24.497]  He would be able to clarify all of that before the committee in a sensitive issue like this?
[02:51:26.934 --> 02:51:30.637]  Well, it certainly makes the situation very awkward.
[02:51:30.637 --> 02:51:50.833]  If you're testifying and saying you have no knowledge and the attorney sitting next to you is one of those that knew what was involved here, I think it does raise an issue that the committee is going to have to look at and determine just exactly who knew what.
[02:51:50.833 --> 02:51:53.775]  This is all Watergate talk, just like the president said a few days ago.
[02:51:53.775 --> 02:51:54.856]  He said this is Watergate 2.0.
[02:51:58.100 --> 02:52:00.763]  They're not giving the president any quarter.
[02:52:00.763 --> 02:52:08.253]  They've committed crimes and now people like Panetta and even Blitzer are now backing away from the burning fireworks factory.
[02:52:10.441 --> 02:52:12.543]  The rats are leaving the sinking ship.
[02:52:12.543 --> 02:52:13.924]  That is what this is.
[02:52:13.924 --> 02:52:24.512]  And the exodus is going to get even worse headlong, but then bottom feeders, local leftist groups and others, they're just going to get more intense and just scream, Oh, whites are evil!
[02:52:24.512 --> 02:52:25.413]  Oh, knowledge is evil!
[02:52:25.413 --> 02:52:26.354]  Burn bugs!
[02:52:26.354 --> 02:52:27.294]  Only do what we say!
[02:52:27.294 --> 02:52:29.696]  We're a cult of losers!
[02:52:29.696 --> 02:52:37.823]  And just, it's going to be beautiful to watch all the sickening, ugly souls flopping around desperately because they couldn't dominate humanity.
[02:52:40.839 --> 02:52:44.000]  Jeff and then Kevin and then Jason and then Alex.
[02:52:44.000 --> 02:52:45.600]  Jeff.
[02:52:45.600 --> 02:52:46.881]  Jeff, you're on the air from Tennessee.
[02:52:46.881 --> 02:52:48.681]  Thanks for holding.
[02:52:48.681 --> 02:52:49.162]  I am.
[02:52:49.162 --> 02:52:50.102]  I apologize.
[02:52:50.102 --> 02:52:53.683]  I'm holding my New Orleans library card and it says Jesse.
[02:52:53.683 --> 02:52:55.023]  I don't know where the Jeff came from.
[02:52:55.023 --> 02:52:56.064]  Well, I apologize.
[02:52:56.064 --> 02:52:57.924]  You know, my eyeballs are half gone.
[02:52:57.924 --> 02:52:59.605]  So I'm going to just say Jesse.
[02:52:59.605 --> 02:53:01.365]  Jesse, come on down, sir.
[02:53:01.365 --> 02:53:02.946]  You're on the air worldwide.
[02:53:02.946 --> 02:53:06.607]  So I hate some rabbits.
[02:53:06.607 --> 02:53:09.428]  Get into the JFK files.
[02:53:09.428 --> 02:53:09.768]  Page 34.
[02:53:11.109 --> 02:53:14.270]  The Sylvia Duran statement, I don't think you need much more.
[02:53:14.270 --> 02:53:19.911]  You've got hundreds of authors trying to figure out why Oswald went down to Mexico.
[02:53:19.911 --> 02:53:21.572]  Was it Oswald?
[02:53:21.572 --> 02:53:33.815]  And right there definitively on page 34, it says the CIA had input on what could go into the Warren report, because they didn't want to give the wiretaps over, because they didn't want to lose that asset.
[02:53:34.636 --> 02:53:35.336]  That's right.
[02:53:35.336 --> 02:53:37.437]  No, these are real documents Trump released.
[02:53:37.437 --> 02:53:38.297]  This is serious.
[02:53:38.297 --> 02:53:40.318]  And then now he's holding back.
[02:53:40.318 --> 02:53:42.299]  I didn't get this from Trump, but I can tell what's happening.
[02:53:42.299 --> 02:53:44.059]  He's in a war.
[02:53:44.059 --> 02:53:45.800]  He released super damning stuff.
[02:53:45.800 --> 02:53:52.462]  And then they got these 200 plus pages, these 200 plus files that are just George Herbert Walker Bush, all of them, everything.
[02:53:52.462 --> 02:53:56.964]  And he's just, he's just going, okay, I got the power just to see what they do.
[02:53:56.964 --> 02:53:59.845]  I'm telling you that Trump is playing hard ball with these guys.
[02:54:00.758 --> 02:54:05.760]  I know the focus is on the Bushes, but this is a really obscure book.
[02:54:05.760 --> 02:54:11.963]  Have you read Bradley, not Bill, but Bradley Ayer's testimony about Zenith Technical?
[02:54:11.963 --> 02:54:14.284]  I think it's called The Zenith Secret?
[02:54:14.284 --> 02:54:16.045]  No.
[02:54:16.045 --> 02:54:16.845]  It's fantastic.
[02:54:16.845 --> 02:54:22.348]  It's about the CIA station in Miami, where most of the Bay of Pigs operations were done.
[02:54:22.348 --> 02:54:22.628]  Miami?
[02:54:22.628 --> 02:54:24.609]  I mean, I knew Zenith was involved, yeah.
[02:54:25.285 --> 02:54:31.687]  Yes, but you've got, the Bradley Heirs places all the Rossellis and the Dave Moraleses.
[02:54:31.687 --> 02:54:35.788]  You know what, just because you know all this history, I'm going to act like a leftist and go, shut up, Nazi!
[02:54:35.788 --> 02:54:39.869]  I'm the intellectual, I don't know anything you're saying, and I kind of feel threatened by the fact you're so smart.
[02:54:39.869 --> 02:54:41.210]  So just shut up, Hitler!
[02:54:41.210 --> 02:54:44.010]  I'm pretty moderate.
[02:54:44.010 --> 02:54:45.171]  No, shut up!
[02:54:45.171 --> 02:54:46.011]  Are you a white male?
[02:54:47.308 --> 02:54:49.169]  I happen to... You're an effing white male!
[02:54:49.169 --> 02:54:50.150]  Shut up!
[02:54:50.150 --> 02:54:51.510]  You don't have a right to say anything!
[02:54:51.510 --> 02:54:53.031]  Did you read the Chronicle?
[02:54:53.031 --> 02:54:54.112]  You're a murderer!
[02:54:54.112 --> 02:54:55.833]  You're a criminal!
[02:54:55.833 --> 02:54:58.554]  You look like what the cops have at their shooting ranges!
[02:54:58.554 --> 02:55:00.595]  Who's the bad guy?
[02:55:00.595 --> 02:55:03.517]  You tell me you're bad right now!
[02:55:03.517 --> 02:55:05.178]  Janet Pearson owe me a paycheck.
[02:55:05.178 --> 02:55:07.419]  I want you to worship Louis Black of the Chronicle.
[02:55:07.419 --> 02:55:10.121]  Tell him he's God.
[02:55:10.121 --> 02:55:13.943]  Everybody thinks you're talking about that comedian who talks about the two Starbucks.
[02:55:14.915 --> 02:55:18.038]  Yeah, that's another leftist turd basket.
[02:55:18.038 --> 02:55:22.382]  Can I talk about the really dirty thing that Ayers mentioned, though?
[02:55:22.382 --> 02:55:23.883]  You'll love it.
[02:55:23.883 --> 02:55:26.585]  He says he was intimidated by the CIA.
[02:55:26.585 --> 02:55:28.147]  I don't know why he wrote this book.
[02:55:28.147 --> 02:55:37.355]  They took him up in a helicopter 2,000 feet up, and it's as if some MKUltra trigger went off in the guy he was with.
[02:55:37.355 --> 02:55:39.997]  The guy lays down in the fetal position 2,000 feet up in the air.
[02:55:41.621 --> 02:55:42.382]  Well, it's all loving.
[02:56:08.339 --> 02:56:11.340]  Let me tell you something, the liberals have, they want to help you.
[02:56:11.340 --> 02:56:18.264]  So just drink fluoride, take the vaccines, you're not going to have any more mind, 30 point IQ reduction, and they all know it, and they don't take it.
[02:56:18.264 --> 02:56:25.167]  Just remember, the left doesn't take the vaccines, they don't take, they don't drink the fluoride, it's their power over you.
[02:56:25.167 --> 02:56:26.028]  Die!
[02:56:26.028 --> 02:56:26.828]  Die!
[02:56:26.828 --> 02:56:27.348]  Die!
[02:56:27.348 --> 02:56:28.849]  It's liberal!
[02:56:28.849 --> 02:56:30.630]  Let them rule!
[02:56:30.630 --> 02:56:31.190]  You understand?
[02:56:31.190 --> 02:56:36.893]  Never seen a broadcast, I tried to get him to watch, he doesn't even know this side of America exists.
[02:56:37.492 --> 02:56:39.493]  Will you say hi, Bill?
[02:56:39.493 --> 02:56:41.014]  Just wave at him for me?
[02:56:41.014 --> 02:56:47.999]  He's gonna have Halloween, he's gonna have 1,500 kids coming to his house, and he's never heard of Alex Jones, never looked into you.
[02:56:47.999 --> 02:56:50.260]  Will you just say hi, Bill, for me?
[02:56:50.260 --> 02:56:51.341]  Hi, Bill!
[02:56:51.341 --> 02:56:55.364]  Okay, Jeff, Jeffrey or whatever, I appreciate your call.
[02:56:55.364 --> 02:56:56.945]  Okay.
[02:56:56.945 --> 02:56:57.725]  I've been bad again.
[02:56:57.725 --> 02:57:00.087]  I only went to one call that second.
[02:57:00.087 --> 02:57:06.051]  But when I return, Kevin, Jason, Alex, John and others, your calls are straight ahead.
[02:57:08.359 --> 02:57:16.967]  Now, InfoWars.com is a site the enemy hates, and I just really want to impress upon you that they really don't like it when you spread the link on your Twitter, your Facebook, your email.
[02:57:18.078 --> 02:57:23.001]  Infowars.com, Newswars.com, and PrisonPlanet.com.
[02:57:23.001 --> 02:57:31.045]  But, let me tell you, Trump releasing 95% of those files is a big ol' fat juicy shot across the bowel.
[02:57:31.045 --> 02:57:39.589]  Remember, if Hillary Clinton would have done what she did with these files in Uranium One in 1950, she'd go to the electric chair.
[02:57:39.589 --> 02:57:41.870]  So instead of lock her up, fry her up.
[02:57:41.870 --> 02:57:42.951]  I mean, I'm not calling for that.

[02:59:47.252 --> 02:59:50.414]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:59:50.414 --> 03:00:00.161]  We are on the march.
[03:00:00.161 --> 03:00:03.403]  The empire is on the run.
[03:00:03.403 --> 03:00:06.986]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[03:00:14.910 --> 03:00:17.571]  Look, cults have been around since civilization began.
[03:00:17.571 --> 03:00:23.314]  And they're just groups of people that get together and try to learn how to manipulate other people.
[03:00:23.314 --> 03:00:28.916]  The Renaissance is about getting rid of all the hidden stuff and actually bringing everything out in the open.
[03:00:28.916 --> 03:00:30.697]  Or illuminating.
[03:00:30.697 --> 03:00:37.940]  The globalists then launched the Illuminati, the proto-globalists, to try to claim they're running the Renaissance to hijack it.
[03:00:37.940 --> 03:00:40.422]  And that's the fight we've been in for 400 plus years.
[03:00:44.209 --> 03:01:10.425]  Now I'm going to go back to your phone calls here right now, but it's just totally hit me that I got to call Roger and some other sources, but the president releasing the already super damning files, and these are real files, I can't believe they kept these, this is really hurting the globalists, and Deep State, and the people that control the media, and now this other stuff is like a guillotine over their head, or the sword of Damocles.
[03:01:12.833 --> 03:01:14.915]  Oh, I guess you trendy liberals don't know what that is if you're watching.
[03:01:14.915 --> 03:01:15.976]  I'm sorry.
[03:01:15.976 --> 03:01:18.459]  The racist KKK Nazi misogyny!
[03:01:18.459 --> 03:01:19.099]  Sorry.
[03:01:19.099 --> 03:01:28.429]  Anyways, and so... That's now just waiting in the wings for him to destroy the Bushes and others.
[03:01:28.429 --> 03:01:31.372]  Because it's already in FBI files that refer to CIA files.
[03:01:32.583 --> 03:01:36.170]  With Bush Senior being involved in the Dallas operation.
[03:01:36.170 --> 03:01:38.855]  He was photographed there with E. Howard Hunt and others.
[03:01:38.855 --> 03:01:43.705]  Okay, let's go ahead and talk to Kevin in Florida.
[03:01:43.705 --> 03:01:44.446]  Kevin, you're on the air.
[03:01:46.670 --> 03:01:47.591]  Thank you so much Alex.
[03:01:47.591 --> 03:01:49.492]  I just want to make two quick points.
[03:01:49.492 --> 03:02:03.121]  Everybody's talking about the disappointment with the JFK files being not released, which I am, but I really don't think it matters because the left has this insane ability to just ignore the facts.
[03:02:03.121 --> 03:02:04.862]  So even if they were to be released,
[03:02:05.482 --> 03:02:16.633]  Every informed individual knows that the government conspired with the CIA and the FBI and all these other multinational corporations to kill JFK because he wanted to shut down the Federal Reserve.
[03:02:16.633 --> 03:02:20.716]  And even if those... And then idiots ask, they go, why get everybody involved?
[03:02:20.716 --> 03:02:21.777]  Well, why in the Roman...
[03:02:22.979 --> 03:02:28.406]  Senate, they have like 15 people stab them, because you've got to stab them to show you're part of the conspiracy.
[03:02:28.406 --> 03:02:37.038]  That's why you do something big like this, you get everybody there, everybody, you have a consensus, so that everybody can't blackmail the other group with it.
[03:02:37.038 --> 03:02:37.399]  Sorry, go ahead.
[03:02:38.982 --> 03:02:42.765]  That's correct, and it's unbelievable.
[03:02:42.765 --> 03:03:01.436]  Another point is, earlier in the show you mentioned the word obsolete, and there's an incredible Twilight Zone episode with Burgess Meredith where he plays an obsolete man, and I think the Deep State is trying to turn all the informed, like-minded individuals into the obsolete men like they did in that particular episode.
[03:03:01.436 --> 03:03:04.818]  Well that's it, they're saying white males are obsolete, the source of all evil.
[03:03:04.818 --> 03:03:06.019]  It is the most racist
[03:03:06.519 --> 03:03:07.520]  I mean, it's incredible.
[03:03:07.520 --> 03:03:09.481]  It's the same as the anti...
[03:03:27.521 --> 03:03:33.062]  Antifa being against fascism when they're hardcore stone-cold fascists.
[03:03:33.062 --> 03:03:37.603]  It's like, it's like, left is right, right is left, two plus two equals five.
[03:03:37.603 --> 03:03:38.963]  1984.
[03:03:38.963 --> 03:03:39.003]  1984.
[03:03:39.003 --> 03:03:50.366]  I mean, these people, you heard Hillary last year said, and then she got asked about it again this year and said, no, it's true, that 1984
[03:03:53.863 --> 03:03:56.266]  Is a story of how to have government and that it's good.
[03:03:56.266 --> 03:03:57.888]  Did you see her say that?
[03:03:59.548 --> 03:04:01.089]  I heard her say all sorts of things.
[03:04:01.089 --> 03:04:06.572]  I heard her say she was going to be the President of the United States, and that we're all going to bow down to her, but that plan got foiled.
[03:04:06.572 --> 03:04:08.293]  I mean, I'll just break it down like this.
[03:04:08.293 --> 03:04:15.016]  We're living in a society right now, Alex, where you can't even convince people that there's fluoride in the water.
[03:04:15.016 --> 03:04:20.719]  You can't convince them that there's cookie bots on their phone that are tracking their location.
[03:04:20.719 --> 03:04:22.860]  Hold on, I want you to be able to finish up.
[03:04:22.860 --> 03:04:25.162]  I want to finish up with you and a few other calls, I promise to do it.
[03:04:26.322 --> 03:04:33.147]  I had a lady come up to me in a grocery store two weeks ago and go, oh, are the black helicopters and fluoride going to get me?
[03:04:33.147 --> 03:04:36.109]  And I went, lady, and I tried to talk to her.
[03:04:36.109 --> 03:04:37.330]  She acted like I was harassing her.
[03:04:37.330 --> 03:04:41.933]  And I said, listen, just look, CNN admits fluoride causes brain damage.
[03:04:41.933 --> 03:04:43.034]  And she just laughed at me.
[03:04:43.034 --> 03:04:45.335]  It's like, it's not funny, lady.
[03:04:45.335 --> 03:04:49.738]  It's but they have this spirit of just whistling past the graveyard.
[03:04:49.738 --> 03:04:51.239]  They don't want help.
[03:04:51.239 --> 03:04:51.559]  Stay there.
[03:04:51.559 --> 03:04:52.120]  I'm gonna come back to you.
[03:04:54.161 --> 03:05:01.348]  This week, the FBI released over 1,500 heavily redacted documents concerning the Sandy Hook investigation.
[03:05:01.348 --> 03:05:08.696]  In many cases, entire pages are redacted, but unredacted portions of the Sandy Hook documents continue to support the narrative.
[03:05:08.696 --> 03:05:16.284]  20-year-old shooter Adam Lanza was a lonely, tech-savvy high school dropout, an experienced shooter with an interest in weapons.
[03:05:16.564 --> 03:05:22.466]  A functioning autistic with a personality disorder and a recluse who liked to play video games all day.
[03:05:22.466 --> 03:05:24.687]  But there's one key update on page 41.
[03:05:24.687 --> 03:05:35.151]  A source told agents that Lanza, while in the 9th grade, was visited at his home by either CIA or FBI agents after hacking a government computer system.
[03:05:35.151 --> 03:05:41.293]  The source said authorities told Nancy Lanza that if her son was that smart, he could have a job with them someday.
[03:05:41.733 --> 03:05:43.796]  InfoWars has the documents!
[03:05:43.796 --> 03:05:51.826]  Read them right now, they're posted in their entirety at the article, FBI releases heavily redacted Sandy Hook investigation docs.
[03:05:51.826 --> 03:05:55.170]  Leanne McAdoo, InfoWars.com.
[03:05:55.170 --> 03:05:59.976]  Radio has changed our lives and effectively saved our lives.
[03:06:05.699 --> 03:06:06.879]  You found it.
[03:06:06.879 --> 03:06:08.941]  The tip of the spear.
[03:06:08.941 --> 03:06:18.267]  It is the Alex Jones Show.
[03:06:18.267 --> 03:06:20.008]  Ladies and gentlemen, we are back live.
[03:06:20.008 --> 03:06:20.729]  It is Friday.
[03:06:20.729 --> 03:06:23.250]  I'll be back this Sunday in studio 4 to 6 p.m.
[03:06:23.250 --> 03:06:25.032]  Central with the Sunday transmission.
[03:06:25.032 --> 03:06:31.156]  Coming up after this broadcast, The War Room with Owen Schroyer, Jack Posobiec and many others that join him.
[03:06:31.156 --> 03:06:32.557]  And then of course we also have
[03:06:33.317 --> 03:06:36.338]  The Real News with David Knight, Monday through Friday, 8 a.m.
[03:06:36.338 --> 03:06:37.859]  to 11 a.m.
[03:06:37.859 --> 03:06:41.260]  before I go live, so be sure and tell your local affiliates about that.
[03:06:41.260 --> 03:06:54.845]  I want to thank all the stations that are picking it up in places like Los Angeles and Chicago and just all over the, I mean, because usually stations have contracts out six months to a year, so a lot of stations are set to pick up the shows in the new year.
[03:06:54.845 --> 03:06:57.046]  We're just kind of beta testing stuff right now, but we've already got
[03:06:58.444 --> 03:07:01.167]  I think Night Show's got 10 stations now carrying it.
[03:07:01.167 --> 03:07:06.172]  We're close to 10 stations with The War Room, and some of them are big.
[03:07:06.172 --> 03:07:11.898]  And just close to 70 or 80 that are set to pick us up January 1st.
[03:07:11.898 --> 03:07:17.504]  So, very, very, because they have their contracts with other groups out there, like Clair Channel and Cumulus and other people.
[03:07:18.124 --> 03:07:20.646]  So, it is very, very exciting to see the shows growing.
[03:07:20.646 --> 03:07:22.527]  Thanks for your support and your prayers.
[03:07:22.527 --> 03:07:29.432]  Infowarsstore.com, great products, great prices, great t-shirts to spread the word, great nutraceuticals, great supplements.

[03:07:39.238 --> 03:07:40.439]  Infowarslive.com or 888-253-3139.
[03:07:40.439 --> 03:07:42.861]  Okay, Kevin in Florida, you're saying JFK release doesn't matter.
[03:07:48.606 --> 03:07:49.970]  And why are you specifically saying it?
[03:07:49.970 --> 03:07:52.777]  Because already folks that are going to be awake are awake?
[03:07:52.777 --> 03:07:53.880]  I mean, what are you getting at?
[03:07:55.817 --> 03:08:02.962]  I'm just getting at the fact that you woke me up years ago through my brother, so I've been listening to you for years.
[03:08:02.962 --> 03:08:05.723]  I'm not saying that it's not pointless.
[03:08:05.723 --> 03:08:15.509]  I'm saying it's pointless in the sense of the left, because even if they release the documents and they tell us everything anybody who's informed knows, it's not going to matter to them.
[03:08:15.509 --> 03:08:16.449]  Facts don't matter.
[03:08:16.449 --> 03:08:19.771]  Their ignorance is their invincibility to themselves.
[03:08:19.771 --> 03:08:22.373]  It's the armor of loserdom that they wear.
[03:08:23.678 --> 03:08:28.700]  Exactly, there's people that still believe the ridiculous magic bullet theory.
[03:08:28.700 --> 03:08:35.302]  I mean, I tell everybody all the time, that's where the term conspiracy theorist came up when people call me a conspiracy theorist.
[03:08:35.302 --> 03:08:52.628]  And by the way, that's declassified that leftist Ford Foundation operatives in the CIA created in 1965 the term conspiracy theorist, that's in the encyclopedia, to then just disregard what people say and then they spew what the CIA put in their mouths 50 years ago
[03:08:53.629 --> 03:08:55.416]  And you're literally watching the mind control.
[03:08:55.416 --> 03:08:55.999]  Is it that pathetic?
[03:08:57.429 --> 03:08:58.249]  It's incredible.
[03:08:58.249 --> 03:09:03.471]  I mean, anybody who believes that magic bullet theory doesn't know anything about physics.
[03:09:03.471 --> 03:09:10.612]  That bullet would have had to do something that's not even humanly possible, much less in a movie, what that bullet did.
[03:09:10.612 --> 03:09:11.393]  No, I hear you.
[03:09:11.393 --> 03:09:12.073]  It's incredible.
[03:09:12.073 --> 03:09:13.053]  God bless you.
[03:09:13.053 --> 03:09:16.294]  I'm going to turn this over to Jack Posobiec here, but I've got callers that have been holding a while.
[03:09:16.294 --> 03:09:17.654]  He said he doesn't mind taking your calls.
[03:09:17.654 --> 03:09:22.736]  He'd like to hear from you, but he'll ride shotgun along with us as we take these three final calls and he takes over with his agenda.
[03:09:22.736 --> 03:09:23.416]  Jack Posobiec?
[03:09:24.356 --> 03:09:25.617]  The Patriot about to get married.
[03:09:25.617 --> 03:09:26.578]  Congratulations on that.
[03:09:26.578 --> 03:09:28.199]  Working some of them full wars.
[03:09:28.199 --> 03:09:33.963]  And of course, one of the key Trump boosters throughout the campaign, the guy the president likes to tweet and that the media has demonized.
[03:09:33.963 --> 03:09:36.725]  They said, you can't be a naval intelligence without the president like you.
[03:09:36.725 --> 03:09:41.349]  I mean, you know, that's that's but it's OK to, you know, be like Hillary with Uranium One.
[03:09:41.349 --> 03:09:50.636]  We've got a report out that a lot of experts are saying, Gorka is saying that Hillary would be executed in 1950s for what she's done with Uranium One.
[03:09:52.782 --> 03:10:05.829]  Yeah, what he's basically saying is how much times have changed since the 1950s and how much we really used to take seriously the threat of foreign influence in our country, the actual possible collusion, communist takeovers that was going on.
[03:10:05.829 --> 03:10:07.450]  You got to go back 1950s.
[03:10:07.450 --> 03:10:09.051]  This was the height of the Cold War.
[03:10:09.051 --> 03:10:11.933]  This was when we were really looking for people like that.
[03:10:11.933 --> 03:10:15.555]  TV show The Americans is all about this kind of stuff that happened back in the 80s.
[03:10:15.555 --> 03:10:19.117]  But it gets into that idea of what was going on during the Cold War.
[03:10:19.117 --> 03:10:22.519]  Back then, the United States had a very strong presence.
[03:10:22.719 --> 03:10:23.259]  We're good to go.
[03:10:42.853 --> 03:10:46.936]  When it's all turned out to basically have been bonafide and real, the response probably wasn't strong enough.
[03:10:46.936 --> 03:10:50.860]  The problem was is that they would divert it down to low-level people instead of burning the high-level folks.
[03:10:50.860 --> 03:10:54.943]  And it was also used to consolidate some right-wing power, which I don't agree with.
[03:10:54.943 --> 03:11:05.732]  But still, everything they claimed about the Red Scare, they're now doing in triplicate, calling for me and Drudge to be shut down, calling for the President to be charged with treason.
[03:11:05.732 --> 03:11:07.413]  And it's all been proven to be a hoax.
[03:11:07.413 --> 03:11:10.476]  And what they say we did, they've been proven to have done.
[03:11:12.034 --> 03:11:13.494]  Yeah, no, I've been caught up in that as well.
[03:11:13.494 --> 03:11:19.976]  They'll come after me because my last name is Polish and say, oh, well, this guy is Polish, and so look at him, he must be some kind of Russian agent.
[03:11:19.976 --> 03:11:23.177]  Meanwhile, that just shows the ignorance of them in the region.
[03:11:23.177 --> 03:11:30.579]  If they understood anything about the history between Russia and Poland, I think they'd be actually quite surprised to find that no Pole would ever go and work with the Russians.
[03:11:30.859 --> 03:11:39.525]  Now, Alex, what it is, is we're in a microcosm of that same type of Red Scare that happened during the 1950s, where we're trying to point out the true stuff that's going on.
[03:11:39.525 --> 03:11:41.366]  They just want to lie about these little things.
[03:11:41.366 --> 03:11:42.226]  Donald Trump Jr.
[03:11:42.226 --> 03:11:46.869]  meeting with a lawyer to talk about Russian adoptions, or all these little things.
[03:11:46.869 --> 03:11:55.435]  Meanwhile, there's this giant pile of evidence that's piling up, and maybe it turned out to be a pile of uranium, at it looks at this point, that they're completely overlooking.
[03:11:55.435 --> 03:11:57.996]  They'll, like, publish one article on it and say, yeah, yeah, we talked about it.
[03:11:57.996 --> 03:12:00.158]  And this is the most strategic espionage.
[03:12:00.659 --> 03:12:01.300]  You could do.
[03:12:01.300 --> 03:12:06.030]  This is the worst thing you can do is give up your strategic stockpile of fizzle material.
[03:12:06.983 --> 03:12:10.405]  That's the part of it that blows my mind that hasn't been brought up more.
[03:12:10.405 --> 03:12:18.329]  We're not talking about her selling, you know, 20% of the U.S., I don't know, stock in some innocuous substance here.
[03:12:18.329 --> 03:12:21.611]  This is specifically nuclear material.
[03:12:21.611 --> 03:12:25.373]  We're talking about actual nuclear material being sold to the Russians.
[03:12:25.373 --> 03:12:34.979]  And that is why it had to go to the SOFIO process in the first place, that it had to be reviewed, the sale, to a Russian company, because anything else wouldn't be considered a strategic asset of the United States.
[03:12:35.339 --> 03:12:40.784]  In this case, the Iranian one was considered and we're breaking down some of the articles I pulled up.
[03:12:40.784 --> 03:12:45.528]  What you're looking at here is actually Bureau of Land Management.
[03:12:45.528 --> 03:12:50.252]  So BLM out there in Oregon is specifically talking about their work
[03:12:51.181 --> 03:12:54.482]  On federal land to dig this stuff up.
[03:12:54.482 --> 03:13:03.144]  And this is the digging that I've been doing this week about their digging in a sense on Uranium One to find that all that stuff, Alex, you remember that was going on in Mulher County, Oregon.
[03:13:03.144 --> 03:13:05.825]  All of that is backed by Uranium One.
[03:13:05.825 --> 03:13:07.685]  They took the land from ranchers.
[03:13:07.685 --> 03:13:10.326]  They took the land from the federal government.
[03:13:10.326 --> 03:13:15.107]  And what they're doing is they've sold it to the highest bidder, which in this case was Vladimir Putin.
[03:13:15.107 --> 03:13:17.087]  That's the Bureau of Land Management website.
[03:13:17.087 --> 03:13:19.948]  That is a public federal government website.
[03:13:20.168 --> 03:13:21.469]  He needs to be in serious trouble.
[03:13:36.621 --> 03:13:51.766]  Right, so that's why I spent all day yesterday having people who follow me call in to Senator Grassley's office and demand that there be an independent investigation started specifically on Uranium One to counter what Robert Mueller is doing.
[03:13:52.066 --> 03:13:57.912]  Because as we've seen, there's so many members of Congress that are tied to this through their financial actions.
[03:13:57.912 --> 03:14:05.639]  And Senator Wyden out in Oregon, I'd be very interested to see how all this was going on in his own, literally his own backyard, without him knowing about it.
[03:14:05.639 --> 03:14:07.641]  You're going to be breaking all this down.
[03:14:07.641 --> 03:14:10.644]  I'm going to turn this over to you, my friend.
[03:14:10.644 --> 03:14:12.105]  It's great to have you here co-hosting with us.
[03:14:12.105 --> 03:14:12.806]  But let me just say this.
[03:14:13.366 --> 03:14:15.349]  Orrin Hatch is announcing his retirement.
[03:14:15.349 --> 03:14:16.951]  I mean, they're all leaving.
[03:14:16.951 --> 03:14:19.354]  It's all, they are collapsing.
[03:14:19.354 --> 03:14:21.657]  They are in a sick mess.
[03:14:21.657 --> 03:14:24.221]  But the deep state's still trying to sabotage the president.
[03:14:24.221 --> 03:14:26.684]  What are you making him holding back those final files?
[03:14:26.684 --> 03:14:27.806]  I think he's using that as leverage.
[03:14:29.797 --> 03:14:41.889]  Uh, from what I heard is that this is a situation where he was told very specifically that, and CIA has done this a number of times, so has ODNI, the Director of National Intelligence.
[03:14:41.889 --> 03:14:48.176]  They've said that if you don't do what we say, that we'll stop giving you briefings or we'll cut off your funds.
[03:14:48.496 --> 03:14:50.997]  They did, but what's come out so far, we're going over it, is very damning.
[03:15:07.898 --> 03:15:19.403]  No, it's come out so far, talk about false flag operations, talk about terrorism plans that the CIA was trying to run inside the United States that they were going to plant on other people, and this is plans going all the way back to the 1960s.
[03:15:19.403 --> 03:15:25.326]  So you talk about what was going on back then, and we're supposedly told that it's all been cleaned up since now, but why?
[03:15:25.326 --> 03:15:29.228]  And by the way, we're going to have a special broadcast this weekend covering all this.
[03:15:29.228 --> 03:15:31.949]  I've got huge intel I'm not ready to drop yet, not just on this.
[03:15:32.569 --> 03:15:34.431]  But it's all incredible.
[03:15:34.431 --> 03:15:36.532]  Jack Posobiec's taking over.
[03:15:36.532 --> 03:15:39.955]  Give those three callers that were still holding a free t-shirt.
[03:15:39.955 --> 03:15:41.316]  Okay, and I apologize to them.
[03:15:41.316 --> 03:15:42.437]  I really appreciate them holding so long.
[03:15:42.437 --> 03:15:42.717]  I don't know.
[03:15:42.717 --> 03:15:43.337]  I can't get to them.
[03:15:43.337 --> 03:15:44.278]  I gotta let Posobiec go.
[03:15:44.278 --> 03:15:45.819]  He's got a lot of great intel for us.
[03:15:45.819 --> 03:15:47.741]  We'll be back with Jack Posobiec on the other side.
[03:15:47.741 --> 03:15:48.622]  I'm Alex Jones.
[03:15:48.622 --> 03:15:49.402]  Please spread the word.
[03:15:49.402 --> 03:15:50.143]  We're in an info war.

[03:19:11.478 --> 03:19:12.840]  Next level compared to whey.
[03:19:13.100 --> 03:19:15.141]  And it's great to mix with whey and then make shakes.
[03:19:15.141 --> 03:19:16.502]  It's incredible.
[03:19:16.502 --> 03:19:18.624]  My son is growing like a weed using it.
[03:19:18.624 --> 03:19:20.565]  He's bigger than I am already.
[03:19:20.565 --> 03:19:21.425]  15, incredible.
[03:19:21.425 --> 03:19:22.646]  It is amazing.

[03:19:31.412 --> 03:19:33.753]  We're the tip of the spear because we're fearless.
[03:19:33.753 --> 03:19:37.015]  We're bold because we understand the stakes are too high.
[03:19:37.015 --> 03:19:37.696]  The globalists win.
[03:19:37.696 --> 03:19:38.416]  We're all slaves.
[03:19:38.416 --> 03:19:40.197]  So don't thank me for what I'm doing.
[03:19:40.197 --> 03:19:41.338]  I want to thank you.
[03:19:41.338 --> 03:19:42.359]  We're all in this together.
[03:19:42.899 --> 03:19:49.387]  And when you get the great Bolan Labe t-shirt, you get the great books and videos, you're fighting the tip of the spear, again.
[03:19:49.387 --> 03:19:55.894]  Visit InfoWarsTore.com today and commit to helping the InfoWar.
[03:19:55.894 --> 03:19:58.517]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:20:14.460 --> 03:20:18.801]  Jack Posobiec coming in here, fourth hour, Alex Jones Show.
[03:20:18.801 --> 03:20:23.382]  I want to thank Alex so much for having me on today, and I appreciate it.
[03:20:23.382 --> 03:20:31.065]  Honestly, an hour, I don't know if that's going to be enough to break down all of the news and the intel that I have to share.
[03:20:31.065 --> 03:20:36.006]  I broke this down a little bit on my personal Twitter page, my Periscope, if you guys have seen that earlier this week.
[03:20:36.646 --> 03:20:42.868]  I teased out a little bit of what's going on, but there's so much coming out in the Uranium One investigation.
[03:20:42.868 --> 03:20:50.670]  There's so much that's happening, honestly, on a day-to-day basis, things that I got from sources just last night, people that I've talked to this morning.
[03:20:50.670 --> 03:21:05.355]  It's changing on a day-to-day basis because the people that were behind that entire scheme, that entire situation, are trying to jump through hoops and move one step ahead of the investigation, one step ahead of the media, and one step of those of us in
[03:21:05.495 --> 03:21:06.315]  I don't think so.
[03:21:26.278 --> 03:21:26.679]  That's right.
[03:21:46.600 --> 03:21:57.173]  And isn't that the perfect t-shirt for someone who's a patriotic American, who loves their country, and doesn't believe in extremism on either side?
[03:21:57.173 --> 03:21:59.716]  Because we are anti-fascism.
[03:21:59.716 --> 03:22:01.538]  And we are anti-communism.
[03:22:01.838 --> 03:22:06.142]  So it's sort of a play on on the other shirts out there, the other symbols.
[03:22:06.142 --> 03:22:09.485]  But in this case, we're standing with the United States of America.
[03:22:09.485 --> 03:22:11.767]  And it's got the don't tread on me flag on there.
[03:22:11.767 --> 03:22:20.734]  I'm going to I actually ordered mine earlier today when I saw that hilarious ad that Alex and Owen and everybody cut the the Info Wars dogs, Reservoir Dogs kind of ad.
[03:22:20.734 --> 03:22:21.615]  It was hilarious.
[03:22:21.895 --> 03:22:22.575]  It was so good.
[03:22:22.575 --> 03:22:27.138]  That is the kind of t-shirt that right there, when you put that up, you're walking down the street.
[03:22:27.138 --> 03:22:36.163]  You are going to be triggering so many people when they see this because they're going to say, wait, I didn't know that we had to talk about fascism and communism.
[03:22:36.163 --> 03:22:37.343]  You don't support one of those.
[03:22:37.343 --> 03:22:37.843]  Which one are you?
[03:22:37.843 --> 03:22:39.724]  And you just say, I'm an American.
[03:22:39.724 --> 03:22:42.066]  I support my country and I love this country.
[03:22:42.066 --> 03:22:43.987]  That is one of the greatest things out there.
[03:22:43.987 --> 03:22:48.369]  I want you guys to go and check it out because that t-shirt is absolutely hilarious.
[03:22:49.595 --> 03:22:54.717]  Probably the other the other product I wanted to mention is brain force plus 50.
[03:22:54.717 --> 03:22:56.457]  It's supercharged.
[03:22:56.457 --> 03:22:59.358]  It is currently on sale 50 percent off.
[03:22:59.358 --> 03:23:06.761]  If you guys go and look at it in the info war store, you guys can pick it up at a super reduced price right now.
[03:23:06.761 --> 03:23:08.081]  This is the stuff I've tried.
[03:23:08.081 --> 03:23:08.902]  Brain Force.
[03:23:08.902 --> 03:23:11.163]  Tonya was a little was a little concerned.
[03:23:11.163 --> 03:23:13.383]  She said, Jack, what's going to happen when you try that brain force?
[03:23:13.383 --> 03:23:15.184]  And I said, I don't know, but let's give it a shot.
[03:23:15.184 --> 03:23:16.024]  We're talking about it.
[03:23:16.024 --> 03:23:16.865]  I want to know what it's like.
[03:23:16.865 --> 03:23:18.005]  And I'm telling you, it gives you
[03:23:18.865 --> 03:23:20.046]  It opens your mind.
[03:23:20.046 --> 03:23:22.587]  It gives you a clear feeling.
[03:23:22.587 --> 03:23:24.047]  It gives you a lot of clarity.
[03:23:24.047 --> 03:23:25.208]  It's not the kind of jitteriness.
[03:23:25.208 --> 03:23:26.448]  I was in the military.
[03:23:26.448 --> 03:23:29.670]  When I would deploy, we would take energy drink after energy drink.
[03:23:29.670 --> 03:23:32.131]  But this brain force, that makes you jittery.
[03:23:32.131 --> 03:23:33.431]  It makes you irritated.
[03:23:33.431 --> 03:23:34.672]  Brain force is not like that.
[03:23:35.092 --> 03:23:35.693]  Thank you so much.
[03:23:57.714 --> 03:24:10.839]  Just this morning, it was confirmed that President Trump himself is the one that gave the order for the FBI informant to be allowed to testify before Congress.
[03:24:10.839 --> 03:24:13.020]  So we had that reported from sources before.
[03:24:13.020 --> 03:24:21.063]  Now it's confirmed that the President of the United States, President Trump, and I don't think you'd find any other president that would allow this, he went to the DOJ and said,
[03:24:21.483 --> 03:24:23.665]  Lift the gag order on this informant.
[03:24:23.665 --> 03:24:41.958]  So there's a confidential informant, someone that we had that was on essentially on the payroll or knew intimately knew the details of the Uranium One deal where there's considerations that he may have actually gone to your to Russia and been part of this and turned over documents.
[03:24:41.958 --> 03:24:47.062]  He's been trying to get this out to congressional investigators for years, but the Obama DOJ
[03:24:47.742 --> 03:24:48.822]  Wouldn't let him.
[03:24:48.822 --> 03:24:54.404]  President Trump himself has now said that this confidential informant should come out.
[03:24:54.404 --> 03:25:12.831]  But here's what's breaking news, is that now, what my sources are telling me, is that Senator Chuck Grassley and the other Democrats on the committee, on the Judiciary Committee, are at odds as to how the informant's testimony should come out in the Senate, in the committee.
[03:25:12.831 --> 03:25:15.872]  And they're currently split on it because it's split down party lines.
[03:25:16.392 --> 03:25:21.954]  The Republicans are saying, we want this to be as open and transparent as possible.
[03:25:21.954 --> 03:25:24.315]  The Democrats are saying that it shouldn't happen.
[03:25:24.315 --> 03:25:25.835]  There's so much infighting.
[03:25:25.835 --> 03:25:28.636]  The Democrats are trying to do everything they can to stall this.
[03:25:28.636 --> 03:25:40.340]  And the latest that I've heard on this is that they're even discussing having separate hearings for the informant, one for the Republicans and one for the Democrats.
[03:25:40.340 --> 03:25:44.922]  So, it doesn't take a genius to explain what's going to happen if they do something like that.
[03:25:45.760 --> 03:25:49.883]  What's going to happen is the Republicans are going to come out and say, oh, well, he said this.
[03:25:49.883 --> 03:25:52.785]  And then the Democrats are going to come out and say, no, no, no, you're wrong.
[03:25:52.785 --> 03:25:53.725]  He told us this.
[03:25:53.725 --> 03:25:56.827]  And therefore, if the two stories don't match up, he's discredited.
[03:25:56.827 --> 03:25:58.869]  This is something you do.
[03:25:58.869 --> 03:26:04.733]  Instead of playing one side against the other, they're playing their investigation off of another investigation.
[03:26:04.733 --> 03:26:14.779]  It's actually parallel investigation to have one informant give testimony to two separate sets of investigators, in this case being the United States Senate Judiciary Committee.
[03:26:16.060 --> 03:26:19.142]  That is an absolute travesty of justice.
[03:26:19.142 --> 03:26:24.926]  There should be no call for a separate hearing of this informant.
[03:26:24.926 --> 03:26:28.589]  There wasn't separate hearings when Roger Stone went and testified to the Intel Committee.
[03:26:28.589 --> 03:26:30.510]  There wasn't a separate hearing when Donald Trump Jr.
[03:26:30.510 --> 03:26:31.350]  went and testified.
[03:26:31.350 --> 03:26:33.632]  Why would there be partisan hearings?
[03:26:33.632 --> 03:26:36.794]  Because they're injecting partisanship into the process.
[03:26:36.794 --> 03:26:44.039]  And once they do that, they can simply run around like Hillary Clinton used to do and say it's a vast right-wing conspiracy and try to discredit this.
[03:26:46.620 --> 03:26:52.623]  As it really stands, and I'm going to be breaking down some background on Uranium One in the next segment here.
[03:26:52.623 --> 03:26:59.466]  This is the scandal that is going to take down so many Senators.
[03:26:59.466 --> 03:27:08.250]  It is going to take down so many people in Dip State because Robert Mueller, we've now found out, was aware of all of this.
[03:27:08.250 --> 03:27:11.211]  Now, another example is Rod Rosenstein.
[03:27:11.211 --> 03:27:13.472]  If there was a confidential informant, right?
[03:27:13.992 --> 03:27:15.793]  Who was running the informant?
[03:27:15.793 --> 03:27:21.354]  Well now we find that the informant was working for Rod Rosenstein, who was running the investigation.
[03:27:21.354 --> 03:27:37.979]  So if he was running him, why then, and Senator Grassley even brought this up and said, why was Rosenstein not forthwith with the fact that he had an informant on the payroll of Uranium One, or at least on the payroll of someone involved with the deal,
[03:27:38.732 --> 03:27:39.073]  That's right.
[03:27:55.376 --> 03:28:05.340]  And a clear example, potentially, of him trying to protect his good old friend that he hired to run the Russia investigation, none other than Mr. Robert Mueller.
[03:28:05.340 --> 03:28:11.743]  Ladies and gentlemen, you're not going to hear this type of information in the lying mainstream media, to borrow a phrase.
[03:28:11.743 --> 03:28:15.104]  You're not going to hear this type of information on other platforms.
[03:28:15.104 --> 03:28:22.527]  That is why we ask you to stick it here with InfoWars, because we can bring the questions together to do things that journalists used to do.
[03:28:23.147 --> 03:28:35.036]  And that's ask hard questions to connect dots and to do investigation into these matters instead of simply parroting talking points and government press releases whenever they're sent out to us.
[03:28:35.036 --> 03:28:36.157]  I'm Jack Posobiec.
[03:28:36.157 --> 03:28:36.798]  I'm going to be here.
[03:28:36.798 --> 03:28:38.579]  We've got 30 minutes to go.
[03:28:38.579 --> 03:28:39.960]  I'm going to cover some more stuff.
[03:28:39.960 --> 03:28:50.629]  But in the next segment, what I'm going to do is talk about specifically if they sold 20% of the uranium, where did the uranium come from and where did the uranium go?
[03:28:50.629 --> 03:28:50.969]  Stay tuned.
[03:28:55.171 --> 03:28:56.632]  Hello, Mr. Anderson.

[03:31:37.501 --> 03:31:41.102]  The liberal establishment media has controlled the narrative for too long.
[03:31:41.102 --> 03:31:44.023]  The silent majority is no longer silent.
[03:31:44.023 --> 03:31:45.303]  This is The War Room.
[03:31:54.813 --> 03:32:03.040]  More than 3,000 never-before-seen documents on the assassination of John F. Kennedy are to be released by the National Archives October 26.
[03:32:03.040 --> 03:32:13.028]  The still-secret documents include more than 3,000 that have never been seen by the public and more than 30,000 that have been released previously but with heavy redactions.
[03:32:13.028 --> 03:32:19.453]  This means that thousands of formerly classified documents related to Kennedy's assassination will be unveiled.
[03:32:19.453 --> 03:32:21.535]  JFK scholars cannot wait.
[03:32:21.835 --> 03:32:25.576]  Longtime Trump advisor Roger Stone was on the Alex Jones Show this week.
[03:32:25.576 --> 03:32:29.817]  He said he spoke directly to the president and urged him to release all the documents.
[03:32:29.817 --> 03:32:38.720]  However, Stone notes that the president is under tremendous pressure by the Central Intelligence Agency to delay the release of the documents for another 25 years.
[03:32:38.720 --> 03:32:41.241]  Stone said the issue is now transparency.
[03:32:41.241 --> 03:32:43.402]  What is the government hiding at this point?
[03:32:43.402 --> 03:32:50.964]  He believes the documents will show that JFK assassin Lee Harvey Oswald was trained, nurtured, and put in place by the CIA.
[03:32:51.764 --> 03:32:53.467]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[03:33:13.436 --> 03:33:16.061]  Waging war on corruption.
[03:33:16.061 --> 03:33:21.130]  It's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWar.
[03:33:26.272 --> 03:33:32.057]  Popping in for Alex Jones today, it's Jack Posobiec here from Washington D.C.
[03:33:32.057 --> 03:33:49.450]  breaking down all the latest of what's going on here in the city that has been rocked over the past few weeks with the revelations of Hillary Clinton's involvement in the Uranium One deal and the fact that the entire situation was under investigation by the FBI.
[03:33:49.990 --> 03:33:57.894]  But was then since swept under the rug by none other than FBI Directors Robert Mueller and James Comey.
[03:33:57.894 --> 03:34:07.520]  Mueller, of course, is now the special prosecutor in charge of the Russia investigation, the Russia collusion investigation on President Trump, whereas James Comey was fired.
[03:34:07.520 --> 03:34:18.486]  However, it really does beg the question, now that the new evidence has come out that Mueller may have been involved in covering up the previous administrations, Barack Obama administrations,
[03:34:19.326 --> 03:34:41.259]  Dealings with Russia, the sale of Uranium One to Russia, the contracting of these lands being approved through the Department of State, Hillary Clinton, while the Secretary of State's husband, Bill Clinton, accepted half a million dollars from the Russian state, as well as 145 million dollars in donations to the Clinton Foundation.
[03:34:42.254 --> 03:34:52.723]  One piece of this that I'd like to go back to, and I brought up some of this with Alex earlier today, is that all of this uranium that we keep talking about, the 20% of the U.S.
[03:34:52.723 --> 03:34:55.645]  uranium, well, where is that uranium, you ask?
[03:34:55.645 --> 03:34:56.646]  Where is it?
[03:34:56.646 --> 03:34:57.406]  Can we find it?
[03:34:57.406 --> 03:34:57.987]  Can we see it?
[03:34:57.987 --> 03:34:58.747]  Can we touch it?
[03:34:58.747 --> 03:34:59.608]  What happened to it?
[03:34:59.608 --> 03:35:00.469]  Is it really gone?
[03:35:00.469 --> 03:35:01.429]  Is it all in Russia?
[03:35:01.429 --> 03:35:01.950]  How do we know?
[03:35:02.899 --> 03:35:25.064]  So if you go back and look, there's actually a Bureau of Land Management website that I did some digging and actually pulled this up that wrote back all the way in 2011 and 2012 that they were indeed looking to secure a deal and approve a deal with Uranium One through their shell company Oregon Energy LLC.
[03:35:26.684 --> 03:35:34.066]  So approve this deal to allow the development of a strip mine or possibly even an open pit mine in Oregon.
[03:35:34.066 --> 03:35:37.467]  The company was later sold and then now subsidiaries, right?
[03:35:37.467 --> 03:35:46.829]  They call it that's what they Uranium One does is that they use all these subsidiaries to make it look like it's an Australian company or make it looks like it's a US company or a Canadian company.
[03:35:46.829 --> 03:35:54.191]  But what happens is they're really all owned at the end of the day by Uranium One, which is in turn owned by the Russian state.
[03:35:55.470 --> 03:36:02.630]  The way it works is, those mines, a lot of them, or a lot of the land usage rights, are actually down in Mulher County.
[03:36:03.772 --> 03:36:04.052]  I don't
[03:36:28.132 --> 03:36:35.056]  Ranchers were the ones that were standing in the way while BLM was trying and pushing very hard to get them off their lands.
[03:36:35.056 --> 03:36:42.241]  FBI's HRT was involved, and now we're breaking down and learning that this project is actually called the Aurora Project.
[03:36:42.241 --> 03:36:48.885]  Now, I know that is kind of a headline-grabbing title, but it's actually because it's near the town of Aurora.
[03:36:48.885 --> 03:36:50.266]  So this Aurora Project
[03:36:50.826 --> 03:36:55.670]  Quite simply says the the Aurora uranium project shows the local infrastructure.
[03:36:55.670 --> 03:36:57.351]  There's been previous minds have been out there.
[03:36:57.351 --> 03:37:00.173]  They've known that uranium has been there since the 1970s.
[03:37:00.173 --> 03:37:03.196]  It's only been in recent years that it was sold out to Russia.
[03:37:03.196 --> 03:37:04.677]  So it used to be that these were done.
[03:37:05.544 --> 03:37:06.284]  We're good to go.
[03:37:30.015 --> 03:37:44.703]  And I got off the phone with a source just before the call today, that what they're doing is the uranium that comes out of there, according to my source, is sent up to Canada, which has different import-export licensing than if they were sending it directly to Russia.
[03:37:45.083 --> 03:37:49.068]  So it goes to Canada, and then it goes to Russia from there.
[03:37:49.068 --> 03:37:57.937]  So what they're kind of doing is almost laundering the uranium in the way that you would launder money, because it was being sent directly from the United States to Russia.
[03:37:57.937 --> 03:38:00.320]  This would obviously trigger a lot of alarm bells.
[03:38:00.320 --> 03:38:02.863]  So what they're doing with Uranium One, which was originally
[03:38:03.523 --> 03:38:10.388]  Park Canadian owned company now they're able to funnel it through Canada then get it back to Russia Here's another shot.
[03:38:10.388 --> 03:38:12.689]  You guys can see of what's going on there.
[03:38:12.689 --> 03:38:29.380]  There's this is one of the major open pit mine It's a diagram for what they wanted what for everything they want to do there These these stock the stockpile areas the processing plants all of this Mulher County very close to where that standoff took place so now this really begs the question of
[03:38:30.129 --> 03:38:37.833]  That if this huge project is going on out there in southwestern Oregon, Aurora, Aurora, Oregon is the name of the cities.
[03:38:37.833 --> 03:38:39.674]  They call it the Aurora project.
[03:38:39.674 --> 03:38:43.136]  Here I am on a Friday talking about Project Aurora.
[03:38:43.136 --> 03:38:44.817]  I didn't think that would be coming up, but.
[03:38:45.814 --> 03:38:50.639]  If all of this is going on, clearly the local representatives would know something about it.
[03:38:50.639 --> 03:38:57.146]  The federal representatives for Oregon, to include Senator Ron Wyden, certainly would know something about it.
[03:38:57.146 --> 03:38:59.408]  We're now seeing, you can see the data.
[03:38:59.408 --> 03:39:03.713]  Total production of uranium concentrated in the United States going all the way down
[03:39:04.801 --> 03:39:06.202]  These are these are in pounds.
[03:39:06.202 --> 03:39:10.546]  So millions and millions of pounds of uranium coming out of the United States.
[03:39:10.546 --> 03:39:12.747]  I think these numbers go through about 2011.
[03:39:12.747 --> 03:39:14.889]  So right around the time this was going on.
[03:39:14.889 --> 03:39:20.053]  This is one of the major uranium spots in not only in the United States, but in the entire world.
[03:39:20.353 --> 03:39:26.495]  And what we're learning that Russia was up to with its Uranium One purchases was to corner the entire, not just U.S.
[03:39:26.495 --> 03:39:35.899]  market on uranium, but actually the world market on uranium, a strategic nuclear material, strategic fizzle material that's used in nuclear weapons.
[03:39:35.899 --> 03:39:41.461]  Now, Russia, of course, we know has a somewhat cozy relationship with North Korea.
[03:39:41.461 --> 03:39:42.541]  Is it possible then?
[03:39:42.541 --> 03:39:43.702]  It's not so far to say.
[03:39:44.637 --> 03:39:45.197]  No, I'm good.
[03:40:03.909 --> 03:40:06.370]  In northwestern the United States.
[03:40:06.370 --> 03:40:25.959]  So, I was discussing this earlier today with a source and I said, what irony that North Korea could be striking the new, the northwestern states of America, right, Washington and Oregon, with uranium that actually came from that very same area, thanks to the machinations of Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama.
[03:40:25.959 --> 03:40:32.262]  Now, I know all this sounds quite sensational, and that's why I'm not Jack Posobiec sitting here and making these claims.
[03:40:32.262 --> 03:40:33.202]  I'm simply calling.
[03:40:34.144 --> 03:40:44.806]  For a special prosecution, a special investigation into this entire situation to find out where our government's culpability comes in on it.
[03:40:44.806 --> 03:41:03.409]  Because if this is true, and they have secured this uranium, and that there were payoffs to Clinton and to Bill Clinton, to the Clinton Foundation, to so many other people that would have had to be involved in this, with approvals coming all over from Uranium One, lining the pockets of everyone involved in this,
[03:41:04.437 --> 03:41:10.181]  While the entire thing was under FBI investigation, the entire investigation then swept under the rug.
[03:41:10.181 --> 03:41:18.747]  Mueller goes and invests in hedge funds long after that, long after he gets out of office, where he's getting his profits.
[03:41:18.747 --> 03:41:20.428]  We need this to be known.
[03:41:20.428 --> 03:41:22.329]  We need this truth to come out.
[03:41:22.329 --> 03:41:28.934]  We need all of it to be put in front of the American people to let them know quite specifically what was going on.
[03:41:28.934 --> 03:41:33.437]  Remember, Hillary Clinton is worth hundreds of millions of dollars.
[03:41:34.133 --> 03:41:36.053]  She's never once had a company.
[03:41:36.053 --> 03:41:38.794]  She's never once had, or at least a successful company.
[03:41:38.794 --> 03:41:43.215]  She did have Whitewater, I suppose, but we can talk about that some other time.
[03:41:43.215 --> 03:41:45.656]  Hillary Clinton didn't sell a product.
[03:41:45.656 --> 03:41:46.956]  She didn't provide a service.
[03:41:46.956 --> 03:41:51.597]  She was in elected and then later appointed government office.
[03:41:51.597 --> 03:41:55.218]  She was in public office and yet ended up a multimillionaire.
[03:41:56.019 --> 03:41:58.261]  What product was she selling, you ask?
[03:41:58.261 --> 03:42:05.206]  Well, it seems that more and more we're learning that that product may have been uranium.
[03:42:05.206 --> 03:42:08.609]  Folks, you're not going to hear this stuff anywhere else in media.
[03:42:08.609 --> 03:42:11.832]  That's why you've got to stick here on InfoWars.
[03:42:11.832 --> 03:42:12.752]  Keep it tuned.
[03:42:12.752 --> 03:42:20.238]  We're going to talk a little bit about the JFK files and then also a little bit about the dossier coming up to round out the fourth hour here today.
[03:42:20.238 --> 03:42:22.060]  I'm Jack Posobiec, guest hosting.
[03:42:22.820 --> 03:42:23.941]  We've got a lot of news.
[03:42:23.941 --> 03:42:24.782]  I know it's a Friday.
[03:42:24.782 --> 03:42:26.023]  I know it's Halloween is coming.
[03:42:26.023 --> 03:42:27.024]  There's a lot going on.
[03:42:27.024 --> 03:42:29.206]  I'm going to a party here in D.C.
[03:42:29.206 --> 03:42:35.711]  later tonight with Lauren Southern, Will Chamberlain, Cassandra Fairbanks, a whole slew of patriots.
[03:42:35.711 --> 03:42:37.873]  So there's a ton of really exciting stuff to go on.
[03:42:37.873 --> 03:42:42.897]  And no, I'm not telling you what my costume is going to be, but you guys stick around.
[03:42:42.897 --> 03:42:45.439]  We might be able to show you a picture of it later on my Twitter account.
[03:42:45.439 --> 03:42:50.464]  But stay here for the rest of the fourth hour, and we will be breaking down so much for you.

[03:47:18.682 --> 03:47:21.603]  Big fourth hour here, InfoWars.
[03:47:21.603 --> 03:47:22.763]  So much to break down.
[03:47:22.763 --> 03:47:24.643]  So much we've got going on.
[03:47:24.643 --> 03:47:32.606]  I'm getting married in eight days, but I'm here trying to hold down the fort on the InfoWars to let people know what's going on in this country.
[03:47:32.606 --> 03:47:40.588]  Because the forces of liberty and patriotism are on the upswing here in the United States.
[03:47:40.588 --> 03:47:45.610]  There is so much that has gone wrong in the globalist's grand plan.
[03:47:46.505 --> 03:47:52.428]  Because of the election of Donald J. Trump, which sent a monkey wrench into everything.
[03:47:52.428 --> 03:48:06.474]  And now there is so much that is unraveling, so much that would have been swept under the rug or shoved down the uranium mine that we never would have known, but is now coming out because of patriots and because of people like you.
[03:48:07.412 --> 03:48:20.998]  Tuning in, sharing, retweeting, and even exposing and researching a lot of the stuff that we're learning about today, because it's all coming out.
[03:48:20.998 --> 03:48:23.099]  Donald Trump is the tip of the sphere.
[03:48:23.099 --> 03:48:36.225]  He's there in the White House, but so many of us are there supporting him from our homes, supporting him on the street, supporting them with our dollars, supporting them with our hours of time in this effort, in this great
[03:48:36.980 --> 03:48:58.524]  and noble effort to take back our country from people who have tried to change it, to twist it, to pervert it into some kind of nightmarish vision that it wasn't supposed to be, to turn the United States truly into the United States again for all people, all Americans, to protect our sovereignty, to protect our national security.
[03:48:58.524 --> 03:49:05.846]  And we found in some of these releases with the JFK files, we found that one organization
[03:49:07.751 --> 03:49:13.836]  Possibly was trying to divide us and that organization is known as the Central Intelligence Agency or CIA.
[03:49:13.836 --> 03:49:22.603]  One of the documents that just came out and I'm telling you there are so many documents in there that it is going to take us weeks, possibly months to dig through this archive.
[03:49:22.603 --> 03:49:33.592]  One of the ones that jumped out at me that I saw and I saw the headline for was the fact that CIA was potentially considering a terror campaign.
[03:49:33.592 --> 03:49:37.035]  Their words, terror campaign in Miami.
[03:49:38.266 --> 03:49:39.128]  We're good to go.
[03:49:49.311 --> 03:49:49.671]  I don't
[03:50:13.679 --> 03:50:16.321]  Operation Mongoose, and it's way down.
[03:50:16.321 --> 03:50:19.883]  I know the producers are following this, but it's way down in the file.
[03:50:19.883 --> 03:50:30.469]  It's almost like 15 pages in, but it will tell you very specifically that they called for a terror campaign, an actual false flag campaign.
[03:50:30.469 --> 03:50:36.453]  So now we have information that CIA is willing to conduct false flag
[03:50:37.296 --> 03:51:05.189]  Operations in the United States which target potentially political opponents and they're willing to conduct these terror campaigns and bombings in our own cities with bombs to carry out their ends and you get this and you guys can read through this is just one of the hundreds of documents thousands of documents that were released yesterday by President Trump and I think to my my own knowledge and this is what Alex asked about at the beginning of the hour he said
[03:51:06.047 --> 03:51:08.087]  Why do you think they were trying so hard?
[03:51:08.087 --> 03:51:11.608]  Why was the deep state trying so hard to block these documents?
[03:51:11.608 --> 03:51:19.770]  And one thing as a prior intelligence officer that we learn is we can say, well, okay, this was a potential operation they looked at in 1962, but they eventually never did.
[03:51:19.770 --> 03:51:21.050]  Right?
[03:51:21.050 --> 03:51:26.811]  But here's the thing is now we're learning about the behavior, the psychology of CIA.
[03:51:26.811 --> 03:51:32.012]  We're learning about something called their TTPs, their tactics, techniques, and procedures.
[03:51:32.012 --> 03:51:33.292]  And these TTPs,
[03:51:34.289 --> 03:51:34.570]  That's great.
[03:51:50.009 --> 03:51:50.670]  We're good to go.
[03:52:05.943 --> 03:52:06.383]  I think?
[03:52:26.804 --> 03:52:26.884]  Yes.
[03:52:43.765 --> 03:52:44.125]  I think so.
[03:53:07.017 --> 03:53:16.684]  And or to spark something like the invasion of Iraq, which was done after the faulty intelligence came out claiming that Iraq held weapons of mass destruction.
[03:53:16.684 --> 03:53:17.464]  Okay.
[03:53:17.464 --> 03:53:18.365]  When none of them were found.
[03:53:18.365 --> 03:53:20.566]  So they're trying to play on your emotions.
[03:53:20.566 --> 03:53:25.770]  And we've now learned that they've been doing this for a very, very long time.
[03:53:25.770 --> 03:53:28.152]  And I don't think that's anything new for this audience.
[03:53:28.152 --> 03:53:32.795]  I don't think this anyone, anything new that I have to tell anyone here, but it's another, it's so important.
[03:53:33.854 --> 03:53:52.025]  That when we can prove that this is something they've been doing for decades, that when we can prove in their own documents and in their own words, unassailably, that this has happened, that we have to call them out on it, and we have to bring up the fact that no, this is not supposition.
[03:53:52.025 --> 03:53:54.306]  This is not some baseless accusation that we're making.
[03:53:54.526 --> 03:54:06.844]  This is your own words in your own release documents about false flag operations that you tried to conduct to condemn political opponents or to potentially spark a war between the U.S.
[03:54:06.844 --> 03:54:07.806]  and Cuba, okay?
[03:54:08.792 --> 03:54:12.835]  Kennedy, there were so many generals, go back to the Cuban Missile Crisis.
[03:54:12.835 --> 03:54:21.361]  There were so many generals, the entire defense department, so many in the defense industrial complex wanted an invasion.
[03:54:21.361 --> 03:54:26.425]  They wanted to invade, they wanted airstrikes to go after the missile silos, they wanted to destroy it.
[03:54:26.425 --> 03:54:32.169]  They did not want JFK using diplomacy to work out the situation.
[03:54:32.169 --> 03:54:33.630]  We all know that that's what JFK did, 13 days.
[03:54:35.504 --> 03:54:46.953]  We all know that JFK worked with Nikita Khrushchev and who then worked with Castro to end the situation peacefully by making a deal where no war had to occur.
[03:54:46.953 --> 03:54:53.758]  Because think about it, any war between Cuba and the United States would not have gone well for the people of Miami.
[03:54:53.758 --> 03:55:01.725]  So is it possible that these agencies were trying to spark even further conflict between Cuba and Miami?
[03:55:02.285 --> 03:55:06.266]  Excuse me, Cuba and the United States with these attacks in Miami.
[03:55:06.266 --> 03:55:10.507]  What else were they willing to do to get Castro out of power?
[03:55:10.507 --> 03:55:14.207]  What else were they willing to accomplish to make this happen?
[03:55:14.207 --> 03:55:23.189]  Because, and you realize this is what happens when they have these ideas, they get it in their head that this has to happen and if we can just trick people, then everything will work out.
[03:55:23.189 --> 03:55:23.929]  But it never does.
[03:55:23.929 --> 03:55:25.449]  Look at Afghanistan, right?
[03:55:25.449 --> 03:55:28.150]  Look at all the blunders we made in Vietnam.
[03:55:28.150 --> 03:55:29.470]  This is what always happens, Iraq.
[03:55:30.399 --> 03:55:35.681]  Now, my last two minutes, I want to break down a little bit of news that's come out on the dossier.
[03:55:35.681 --> 03:55:51.265]  And we now know that the dossier was found by, was funded, excuse me, by Hillary Clinton and the DNC after reported, reported and repeated statements that Hillary's campaign was not funding it by Mr. John Podesta himself.
[03:55:51.705 --> 03:55:52.185]  I think so.
[03:56:12.788 --> 03:56:14.329]  We'll take down Hillary.
[03:56:14.329 --> 03:56:25.976]  What they're doing is they're trying to throw Hillary Clinton under the bus in a way that only affects her but doesn't affect the rest of the enterprise, doesn't affect the rest of the establishment.
[03:56:25.976 --> 03:56:28.297]  The dossier is a good way to do that.
[03:56:28.297 --> 03:56:42.266]  It will take down Hillary and it would potentially take down James Comey as well because there are a lot of lingering questions about when exactly his knowledge of Orbis, his knowledge of Chris Steele, his knowledge of the dossier came into play.
[03:56:43.027 --> 03:56:48.251]  Was this known prior to their involvement with Fusion GPS?
[03:56:48.251 --> 03:56:49.752]  So much to come out.
[03:56:49.752 --> 03:56:52.594]  So many things for us to break down and follow.
[03:56:52.594 --> 03:56:54.595]  And that is why you've got to stick it here.
[03:56:54.595 --> 03:56:59.919]  We've got War Room coming up with Owen Troyer, who is always great at telling everybody what's going on.
[03:56:59.919 --> 03:57:03.882]  Roger Stone is out and about breaking down things as a correspondent.
[03:57:03.882 --> 03:57:04.762]  And I'm Jack Posobiec.
[03:57:04.762 --> 03:57:05.463]  And what am I up to?
[03:57:05.863 --> 03:57:10.268]  I'm trying to fight the info war while I'm also trying to get married here in eight days.
[03:57:10.268 --> 03:57:15.133]  So the lovely Tanya Tay is always telling me, uh, stop your research for one second.
[03:57:15.133 --> 03:57:16.235]  We have to pick out flowers.
[03:57:16.235 --> 03:57:19.018]  You have to pick out bow ties or something, but it's an amazing thing.
[03:57:19.870 --> 03:57:22.993]  We're trying to bring back our traditions.
[03:57:22.993 --> 03:57:25.095]  We're trying to bring back our country.
[03:57:25.095 --> 03:57:28.659]  And to me, marriage is one of the most beautiful ways to do that.
[03:57:28.659 --> 03:57:35.606]  Something I can do in my own time, as well as the Rev 18 pack that we founded with Mike Cernovich and Jeff Giese.
[03:57:35.606 --> 03:57:37.708]  Thank you guys so much for listening.
[03:57:37.708 --> 03:57:39.430]  Jack Posobiec here.
[03:57:39.430 --> 03:57:40.872]  I'll be back next week to talk to you.
[03:57:40.872 --> 03:57:41.833]  Stay tuned for War Room.
