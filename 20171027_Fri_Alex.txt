[00:00.000 --> 00:29.920]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[00:29.920 --> 00:42.560]  Last Friday, we broke the news that President Trump told Roger Stone and others that, barring
[00:42.560 --> 00:48.280]  any new information, he was going to release JFK files by Thursday night.
[00:48.280 --> 00:57.080]  He released about 95% of it, but 300 files roughly were kept back.
[00:57.080 --> 01:00.680]  And that just adds to everybody's concern.
[01:00.680 --> 01:03.640]  We're getting information from Gorka and others with connections to the White House
[01:03.640 --> 01:09.080]  that they really fought Trump on this, the deep state did, and basically refused to do
[01:09.080 --> 01:10.080]  it.
[01:10.080 --> 01:12.880]  And we know there's been an ongoing rebellion in government.
[01:12.880 --> 01:17.840]  And so the President tweeted out after this happened and after the media spun it that
[01:17.840 --> 01:22.200]  he'd lied to the public saying he'd release everything, saying, no, they've put it into
[01:22.200 --> 01:25.520]  some committee for review the next six months.
[01:25.520 --> 01:29.800]  And I think that all of it will get released, hopefully.
[01:29.800 --> 01:32.200]  But this is an example of how they're bucking the President.
[01:32.200 --> 01:33.200]  There it is.
[01:33.200 --> 01:36.160]  JFK files are being carefully released.
[01:36.160 --> 01:39.280]  In the end, there will be great transparency.
[01:39.280 --> 01:43.560]  It's my hope to just get about everything out of the public.
[01:43.560 --> 01:48.280]  And it's my hope to get just about everything out of the public.
[01:48.280 --> 01:51.480]  That's what he tweeted this morning.
[01:51.480 --> 01:53.320]  Roger Stone's joining us in the next segment.
[01:53.320 --> 01:55.800]  He obviously has a lot of intel on that.
[01:55.800 --> 01:57.880]  And so do I.
[01:57.880 --> 02:04.280]  I have been talking at length with one of the only White House sources left.
[02:04.280 --> 02:06.880]  I'm just going to leave it at that.
[02:06.880 --> 02:09.400]  And obviously our phones are all tapped by deep state.
[02:09.400 --> 02:10.400]  And so has Roger.
[02:10.400 --> 02:18.360]  Roger's been talking to other very big heavy hitters, including the President, obviously.
[02:18.360 --> 02:26.040]  And separate from the JFK stuff we'll cover in the next segment.
[02:26.040 --> 02:34.200]  The info I've got so important and so big, I'm not ready to put it out on here because
[02:34.200 --> 02:39.280]  I need to really look at every angle of it.
[02:39.280 --> 02:48.720]  Not just for everybody's safety, I think I'm going to have to go ahead and put it on here
[02:48.720 --> 02:49.720]  today.
[02:49.720 --> 02:50.720]  And then there's a whole other subject.
[02:50.720 --> 02:58.520]  I'm going to leave it at that concerning Vegas that is real dangerous.
[02:58.520 --> 03:08.480]  You talk about a hot potato, you talk about a hanger name with a pen pulled on it.
[03:08.480 --> 03:16.240]  I just am speechless at this point because believe me, an entire FBI office wouldn't
[03:16.240 --> 03:21.480]  know what to do in a few hours with just one of these issues I've got.
[03:21.480 --> 03:27.040]  And by that, I mean, these are such big, complex things.
[03:27.040 --> 03:31.760]  And we have so much credibility with people that actually are involved in and out of the
[03:31.760 --> 03:43.400]  government that we get this intel just continually that is just bombshell.
[03:43.400 --> 03:53.480]  And I'm just asking myself, how do I present all this properly when, say, news is like
[03:53.480 --> 03:57.840]  trying to bail out a boat that's got a leak in it, and I'm trying to bail it out with
[03:57.840 --> 04:03.640]  a teacup and it's just waters is pouring in.
[04:03.640 --> 04:08.680]  The news is all completely over the top insane.
[04:08.680 --> 04:21.880]  There is a national blackout martial law drill set to take place throughout October, late
[04:21.880 --> 04:30.560]  October into November, simulating martial law if the left blows up the power plants or
[04:30.560 --> 04:31.560]  the transformers.
[04:31.560 --> 04:35.920]  We know they've been training for that and I had that info months ago, it didn't go public
[04:35.920 --> 04:38.640]  with it on air, but now it's in the news.
[04:38.640 --> 04:40.480]  I mean, there's just big stuff coming.
[04:40.480 --> 04:42.280]  There's a civil war in this country.
[04:42.280 --> 04:45.360]  The globalists don't tend to turn loose about a fight.
[04:45.360 --> 04:46.360]  Stay with us.
[04:46.360 --> 05:00.040]  We'll figure out how to present all this, but this is really important.
[05:00.040 --> 05:05.720]  This week, the FBI released over 1,500 heavily redacted documents concerning the Sandy Hook
[05:05.720 --> 05:07.120]  investigation.
[05:07.120 --> 05:12.160]  In many cases, entire pages are redacted, but unredacted portions of the Sandy Hook
[05:12.160 --> 05:14.520]  documents continue to support the narrative.
[05:14.520 --> 05:20.240]  The 20-year-old shooter Adam Lanza was a lonely, tech-savvy, high school dropout and experienced
[05:20.240 --> 05:25.160]  shooter with an interest in weapons, a functioning autistic with a personality disorder, and
[05:25.160 --> 05:28.280]  a recluse who liked to play video games all day.
[05:28.280 --> 05:33.760]  But there's one key update on page 41, a source told agents that Lanza, while in the 9th
[05:33.760 --> 05:39.640]  grade, was visited at his home by either CIA or FBI agents after hacking a government
[05:39.640 --> 05:40.920]  computer system.
[05:40.920 --> 05:45.680]  The source said authorities told Nancy Lanza that if her son was that smart, he could have
[05:45.680 --> 05:47.720]  a job with them someday.
[05:47.720 --> 05:49.640]  Infowars has the documents.
[05:49.640 --> 05:50.640]  Read them right now.
[05:50.640 --> 05:53.000]  They're posted in their entirety at the article.
[05:53.000 --> 06:21.720]  The FBI releases heavily redacted Sandy Hook investigation docs, Leanne McAdoo, Infowars.com.
[06:21.720 --> 06:39.320]  I'm going to get to this later, not because it's about me, but because it's a total lie
[06:39.320 --> 06:42.640]  and it's the anatomy of how they engage in frauds.
[06:42.640 --> 06:47.120]  Raw Story News Week and others haven't known how to respond the last month, us being the
[06:47.120 --> 06:51.880]  cutting edge folks breaking the main news about the official narrative of Vegas being
[06:51.880 --> 06:52.880]  false.
[06:52.880 --> 06:59.440]  So their new thing is to say that I say that nobody died there and that I am attacking
[06:59.440 --> 07:01.480]  the victims through my listeners.
[07:01.480 --> 07:04.840]  Total bull, but that's Raw Story.
[07:04.840 --> 07:08.480]  That's News Week and that's just how they operate.
[07:08.480 --> 07:09.720]  So that's coming up.
[07:09.720 --> 07:22.000]  Speaking of Vegas, either today or tomorrow, we're looking to break the most hardcore smoking
[07:22.000 --> 07:29.040]  gun information about Vegas yet and I'll just leave it at that.
[07:29.040 --> 07:31.120]  Obviously we are a big media outlet.
[07:31.120 --> 07:32.200]  People know we're independent.
[07:32.200 --> 07:37.840]  They know we're fearless to the point of being pretty much crazy.
[07:37.840 --> 07:45.520]  And I'll have to process this information today because it's been on our plate since
[07:45.520 --> 07:53.640]  about 11 o'clock last night and then we're going to cover it once I decide what to do.
[07:53.640 --> 07:55.320]  And I'm not complaining.
[07:55.320 --> 08:03.000]  I just wish there was more time because I've got five different bombshell stories that
[08:03.000 --> 08:08.760]  we're right in the middle of that I know are key.
[08:08.760 --> 08:17.600]  We've got this martial law drill simulating the left knocking out the power grid.
[08:17.600 --> 08:21.640]  They can't turn off the coal power systems and if they can't sabotage the economy, I
[08:21.640 --> 08:23.720]  mean, that's what they're talking about doing.
[08:23.720 --> 08:26.400]  And I didn't even get into this a month ago, a month and a half ago when I learned about
[08:26.400 --> 08:33.840]  it from let's just say the shadow government or the folks that actually deal with it on
[08:33.840 --> 08:41.040]  the ground, the military that's assigned to the FBI and assigned to these task forces.
[08:41.040 --> 08:47.120]  They have picked up coordinated drilling going on all over the country with the left planning
[08:47.120 --> 08:50.440]  to attack the power grid in November.
[08:50.440 --> 08:53.440]  And I didn't put this on air because I don't want to give their own people ideas.
[08:53.440 --> 08:56.600]  I'm going to put it in the news today.
[08:56.600 --> 08:58.720]  They're going to simulate national power outages.
[08:58.720 --> 09:01.560]  We're going to Roger Stone here in just a moment.
[09:01.560 --> 09:05.240]  We've got Mattis basically signaling they're preparing to use nuclear weapons on the DMZ
[09:05.240 --> 09:06.480]  as I told you they'll have to.
[09:06.480 --> 09:10.120]  There's 100,000 pieces of artillery there aimed at Seoul.
[09:10.120 --> 09:12.760]  So it's the only tactic.
[09:12.760 --> 09:21.800]  And the head of the South Korean Defense Ministry, Song Yong-mu, said that we are going to need
[09:21.800 --> 09:27.720]  offensive systems to neutralize this and Mattis replied understood and really that was all
[09:27.720 --> 09:31.800]  choreographed and just signaled to the North they're going to use nuclear weapons on them.
[09:31.800 --> 09:33.880]  So this is really escalating fast.
[09:33.880 --> 09:42.280]  I'm going to get into that and I've got intel on that.
[09:42.280 --> 09:47.520]  There's a lot of news breaking on the Kennedy assassination today with the KGB files coming
[09:47.520 --> 09:52.800]  out that they believed Lyndon Johnson killed President Kennedy and was planning a false
[09:52.800 --> 09:54.000]  flag to blame Russia.
[09:54.000 --> 09:59.040]  We know part of that's true because Operation Northwoods was a similar plan killed by Kennedy.
[09:59.040 --> 10:04.400]  We also have British newspaper received mystery call minutes before JFK assassination telling
[10:04.400 --> 10:06.480]  him it was going to happen.
[10:06.480 --> 10:07.760]  We've got all that.
[10:07.760 --> 10:14.680]  But joining us is Roger Stone for the next few segments to discuss from his sources and
[10:14.680 --> 10:18.360]  probably we predicted this not just last Friday but Sunday and Monday we said we think
[10:18.360 --> 10:20.120]  they're going to black out a bunch of it.
[10:20.120 --> 10:26.000]  The president can order it released but they've already blacked most of it out.
[10:26.000 --> 10:27.000]  They've done this before.
[10:27.000 --> 10:34.480]  Well, instead of doing that, what they've done with 2,000 plus pages they've released
[10:34.480 --> 10:43.560]  the 3,000 is they just held back 300 files while they decide what to do.
[10:43.560 --> 10:47.160]  And they just told the president you're violating national security if you do this and the word
[10:47.160 --> 10:50.320]  I got is they just double crossed him last minute and didn't put it out.
[10:50.320 --> 10:53.400]  The president doesn't want to look embarrassed.
[10:53.400 --> 10:56.880]  CNN is acting like he reneged and double crossed everybody when he could have just done like
[10:56.880 --> 11:00.640]  past presidents and said no, I'm not releasing it.
[11:00.640 --> 11:07.920]  And so you're seeing deep state quicksand from my intel basically refuse in a mutinous
[11:07.920 --> 11:10.760]  action to go along with the president.
[11:10.760 --> 11:15.000]  It's just like Schumer said the intelligence agencies can have seven ways of Sunday to
[11:15.000 --> 11:17.040]  get you and we've been seeing him leak on him.
[11:17.040 --> 11:24.320]  He said it was the FBI director that did it and it turned out it was and it's just a
[11:24.320 --> 11:25.320]  mess.
[11:25.320 --> 11:26.320]  It's a civil war going on in the country.
[11:26.320 --> 11:31.440]  We'll get Roger Stone's take on this briefly because I want to segue into some of the big
[11:31.440 --> 11:32.440]  intel you've got.
[11:32.440 --> 11:35.680]  I don't know how much of it you can get into now but it dovetails with mine about what's
[11:35.680 --> 11:36.800]  really going on in the White House.
[11:36.800 --> 11:39.960]  I know you tried to have a longer meeting with me this morning and I had to get off
[11:39.960 --> 11:45.520]  the phone so we were unable to complete our decision process on this but this is really
[11:45.520 --> 11:49.440]  important obviously.
[11:49.440 --> 11:54.920]  So I've gotten overwhelmed at this point, Roger, just how crazy this has gotten.
[11:54.920 --> 11:58.920]  The fog of war here but you agree with me this morning that the tide is turning.
[11:58.920 --> 12:00.520]  We've had a really good 10 days.
[12:00.520 --> 12:03.440]  The deep states, the corrupt elements of it are on the run.
[12:03.440 --> 12:09.920]  First of all I think this is a graphic illustration of how quickly American politics and attitudes
[12:09.920 --> 12:13.840]  towards everything can change in just 10 days.
[12:13.840 --> 12:20.320]  Between the Uranium-1 bombshell that the Obama administration engaged in a cover-up
[12:20.320 --> 12:26.800]  of effort by the Russians to get control of 20% of our Uranium output with big bribes
[12:26.800 --> 12:31.960]  to the Clintons as part of it, followed by the revelations that Hillary and her people
[12:31.960 --> 12:38.760]  paid for the Smear dossier in what you did in PPGate where they turned it to Smear Trump
[12:38.760 --> 12:46.440]  by the way, $3 million of your tax dollars funneled to that operation through the FBI.
[12:46.440 --> 12:53.840]  And now Trump taking a bold and I think courageous stand and releasing the documents only to
[12:53.840 --> 13:01.840]  have the deep state do a rear-guard action where they're attempting to redact, censor,
[13:01.840 --> 13:08.600]  hold back as much as they possibly can, essentially countermanding the president in defying the
[13:08.600 --> 13:09.600]  will.
[13:09.600 --> 13:14.200]  So your intel agrees with my intel and with Gorka as saying and Lou Dobbs, that's exactly
[13:14.200 --> 13:15.200]  what happened.
[13:15.200 --> 13:21.120]  No, there's no question, the guys in Langley are moving quickly to cover their assets.
[13:21.120 --> 13:23.280]  They've got to clean these up quickly.
[13:23.280 --> 13:26.560]  Why they didn't already have these redactions done?
[13:26.560 --> 13:27.560]  Why they didn't already have?
[13:27.560 --> 13:30.560]  Clearly they haven't sitting around for blackmail purposes.
[13:30.560 --> 13:36.600]  They thought they would bluff him and he would never allow release of these.
[13:36.600 --> 13:42.920]  As I reported at InfoWars, the intelligence agencies lobbied the president.
[13:42.920 --> 13:49.720]  This was going to hurt them by revealing their methods, their sources, their operations.
[13:49.720 --> 13:51.520]  It's nonsense.
[13:51.520 --> 13:52.520]  They lied then.
[13:52.520 --> 13:53.520]  They lie now.
[13:53.520 --> 13:55.480]  That's what they don't want people to see.
[13:55.480 --> 14:00.920]  The same people who undermined John F. Kennedy and liquidated him are the people trying to
[14:00.920 --> 14:02.400]  take down our president.
[14:02.400 --> 14:07.280]  And I want to be specific because that's even buried in the news that last minute they just
[14:07.280 --> 14:10.480]  said, oh, last minute, let us hold this back.
[14:10.480 --> 14:11.840]  There's not time.
[14:11.840 --> 14:15.640]  Put it to this committee six months and just they made the decision.
[14:15.640 --> 14:17.880]  So what's the headline on that?
[14:17.880 --> 14:25.840]  CIA, deep state, does rearguard action, mutinies against Trump, refuses to release documents?
[14:25.840 --> 14:30.720]  Until I can, they've only put out a small portion of what they have.
[14:30.720 --> 14:34.160]  We have to review how much of it's just redacted, just blacked out.
[14:34.160 --> 14:40.480]  Lee Harvey Oswald met with black at the black and they discussed that the next five paragraphs
[14:40.480 --> 14:44.680]  are just blacked out by some bureaucrat.
[14:44.680 --> 14:50.280]  It's most definitely an effort to nullify the law put in place by Congress and signed
[14:50.280 --> 14:54.200]  by the president to let the people know what really happened.
[14:54.200 --> 15:00.160]  And the good news, Alex, is that I was told they went to him and said, these 200 documents
[15:00.160 --> 15:01.960]  can never be released.
[15:01.960 --> 15:04.040]  We just don't have enough time to explain to you why.
[15:04.040 --> 15:08.360]  And he said, good, put a time clock of six months on them and we'll look at them.
[15:08.360 --> 15:13.920]  So he hasn't, he hasn't, he's attempting to keep his commitment.
[15:13.920 --> 15:19.440]  I'm certainly, I am certain that no one has brought him the documents showing him the
[15:19.440 --> 15:23.680]  redactions, but he'll look into that.
[15:23.680 --> 15:28.920]  If they redacted these, if they censored them so much that they were mushed, that they were
[15:28.920 --> 15:33.640]  useless for historians or researchers, the president will be able to see that.
[15:33.640 --> 15:37.360]  Well, I think that's the process that's now going to happen in the next six months, where
[15:37.360 --> 15:43.880]  they just take each page and dip it in black ink and that's just incredible that we're
[15:43.880 --> 15:47.240]  53 years later and we already know the truth.
[15:47.240 --> 15:51.560]  When we come back, Roger, I want to get into what we were discussing earlier as much as
[15:51.560 --> 15:55.640]  you can, because I don't think we can sit on this information dealing with what's happening
[15:55.640 --> 15:58.880]  inside the Trump White House.
[15:58.880 --> 16:00.600]  Fully cooked, ready to eat bacon.
[16:00.600 --> 16:05.400]  I'm talking thick meaty, center cut, presidential bacon, savory and delicious.

[20:17.840 --> 20:25.840]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[20:25.840 --> 20:37.280]  Okay, some of this news, we're going to have to break in studio next week.
[20:37.280 --> 20:42.720]  I may even get Roger here this weekend because we've got to really go over this entire model
[20:42.720 --> 20:44.760]  of how they're planning to take out the president.
[20:44.760 --> 20:48.840]  We have the blueprint, not that we've reverse engineered, we have it.
[20:48.840 --> 20:53.760]  Okay, we know who the players are, it's gotten very clear now.
[20:53.760 --> 20:57.320]  And the exact plan and the neocons working with the Democrats and the whole deal.
[20:57.320 --> 21:02.200]  Now, it's not going well for them, but they're biding their time.
[21:02.200 --> 21:06.760]  Roger's got a huge data dump, and you're going to get it exclusively here.
[21:06.760 --> 21:09.160]  People say, oh, we don't care about the entry of the White House.
[21:09.160 --> 21:14.440]  This is the entry of the ship of state trying to turn the Republic around.
[21:14.440 --> 21:18.240]  And the whole world's watching this, and we see Catalonia declaring independence.
[21:18.240 --> 21:21.080]  Spain declared martial law.
[21:21.080 --> 21:23.880]  No rule, they're sending in federal troops.
[21:23.880 --> 21:26.640]  There's just wild stuff happening everywhere.
[21:26.640 --> 21:34.320]  DoD plans solar storm-based national blackout drill during Antifa protests in November.
[21:34.320 --> 21:38.280]  And Antifa says they're planning terror attacks, then the media spins it and says, no, they're
[21:38.280 --> 21:39.280]  not.
[21:39.280 --> 21:41.960]  Just like what CNN says, yeah, the deep state's going to kill Trump.
[21:41.960 --> 21:44.280]  And then they say, Jones is crazy.
[21:44.280 --> 21:50.520]  His favorite conspiracy theory is that we're talking about Civil War or the 25th Amendment
[21:50.520 --> 21:54.800]  or removing Trump, and then they, next hour, they promote it.
[21:54.800 --> 22:01.000]  So it's a very weird tactic they've got where they prepare it in public, but then say they're
[22:01.000 --> 22:03.760]  not doing it.
[22:03.760 --> 22:07.000]  It's a military tactic, actually, you know, don't run, we are your friends.
[22:07.000 --> 22:10.200]  Roger, obviously this is huge news.
[22:10.200 --> 22:15.360]  What do you want to break now, just so folks coming up next week realize how accurate this
[22:15.360 --> 22:20.360]  was, just like when we said, you know, months ago in April, no, the president's not going
[22:20.360 --> 22:24.600]  to send in 100,000 troops into Syria and take out Damascus.
[22:24.600 --> 22:28.640]  Even though his generals, McMaster, were saying they would on CNN three days later, the president
[22:28.640 --> 22:30.680]  came out and said those exact words.
[22:30.680 --> 22:34.480]  So you're about to do that yet again to let people know what's going on, dealing with
[22:34.480 --> 22:37.280]  military activity in the White House.
[22:37.280 --> 22:38.280]  Go ahead.
[22:38.280 --> 22:44.160]  First of all, I think it's important to recognize exactly who General H.R. McMaster is.
[22:44.160 --> 22:51.080]  Let's remember that McMaster was put in place on the recommendation of Jared Kushner, the
[22:51.080 --> 22:57.520]  president's son-in-law, presumably his lovely wife, Ivanka, all federal employees, members
[22:57.520 --> 22:59.800]  of this administration.
[22:59.800 --> 23:07.280]  And he is formally worked for a think tank funded by the Ford Foundation, the Rockefeller
[23:07.280 --> 23:13.800]  Foundation, and George Soros, his connect, he's a member of the Council on Foreign Relations.
[23:13.800 --> 23:20.440]  He wrote a book criticizing the Johnson administration's conduct of the war, where the generals were
[23:20.440 --> 23:22.240]  lying to the president.
[23:22.240 --> 23:28.520]  And some have taken that to believe that he is a non-Neocon, but he is Neocon through
[23:28.520 --> 23:29.520]  and through.
[23:29.520 --> 23:38.080]  He is bolstered internally by Dina Habib Powell, formerly of the Bush White House, and working
[23:38.080 --> 23:39.400]  for the senator from Texas.
[23:39.400 --> 23:43.920]  He is an ardent globalist and never a trooper.
[23:43.920 --> 23:52.520]  And then, so McMaster is very close to both General Kelly and General Pettis.
[23:52.520 --> 23:57.480]  And this is what we call about seven days in May group.
[23:57.480 --> 24:01.040]  And they are, without any question, Neocons.
[24:01.040 --> 24:07.360]  Let's remember that all three of them wanted to send 150,000 troops to Syria right after
[24:07.360 --> 24:11.800]  the president ordered a strategic bombing there.
[24:11.800 --> 24:18.000]  And you'll remember that the president very wisely narrowed the assault down, so it would
[24:18.000 --> 24:23.440]  have some military value, and also to send a little message to the Chinese and the North
[24:23.440 --> 24:30.000]  Koreans and the Iranians that Donald Trump is not the cream puff that Obama was.
[24:30.000 --> 24:33.200]  And I think they got the message loud and clear.
[24:33.200 --> 24:38.040]  But even then, he doesn't want to go intervene in these places, ineffectively.
[24:38.040 --> 24:44.280]  And the president wisely said to their recommendation of 150,000 troops, not happening.
[24:44.280 --> 24:49.800]  In any event, I have learned, you'll remember that the president announced that we would
[24:49.800 --> 25:01.160]  continue our engagement in McMaster, but he would not be willing to say a number.
[25:01.160 --> 25:03.560]  He dropped the number 9,000.
[25:03.560 --> 25:08.600]  What he gave was Pettis the authority to send more than 9,000.
[25:08.600 --> 25:15.520]  And then recently McMaster essentially gave the president a decision memo on 50,000 troops.
[25:15.520 --> 25:19.360]  Alex, that would be our largest troop allotment ever to Afghanistan.
[25:19.360 --> 25:24.000]  So rather than withdrawing, we would be expanding, inconsistent with Trumpism.
[25:24.000 --> 25:27.200]  And I told the president, looked at it and said, what's this?
[25:27.200 --> 25:32.920]  And he said, well, that's the number of troops we need for Afghanistan.
[25:32.920 --> 25:36.240]  And the president said, we need to have a meeting on this.
[25:36.240 --> 25:37.840]  We need to have a meeting on this.
[25:37.840 --> 25:39.320]  And he wouldn't sign it.
[25:39.320 --> 25:46.560]  So I mean, this is the kind of trickery, I assume McMaster thought he could sign as
[25:46.560 --> 25:47.560]  the president.
[25:47.560 --> 25:52.120]  This is the way the neocons, in fact, the Trump White House.
[25:52.120 --> 25:55.400]  By the way, this is just bombshell because we broke three days before the president
[25:55.400 --> 26:01.320]  word for word said, I'm pushing back, we're not invading Damascus, Hillary and Obama started
[26:01.320 --> 26:02.320]  that war.
[26:02.320 --> 26:04.880]  We're on the wrong side, we're taking on ISIS.
[26:04.880 --> 26:07.360]  We broke that because obviously it came around from the president.
[26:07.360 --> 26:13.400]  Now you're giving people the intel of what they tried to slip past him dealing with Afghanistan.
[26:13.400 --> 26:14.400]  Recap that.
[26:14.400 --> 26:15.400]  That's so important.
[26:15.400 --> 26:20.000]  The president announced that he was going to allow us to keep troops in Afghanistan.
[26:20.000 --> 26:23.240]  He would let General Pettis decide how many.
[26:23.240 --> 26:26.480]  They hinted that it was around 9,000.
[26:26.480 --> 26:31.280]  Then suddenly we have HR McMaster giving the president the document authorizing 50,000
[26:31.280 --> 26:32.780]  troops.
[26:32.780 --> 26:35.480]  Obviously no one had ever mentioned this to the president.
[26:35.480 --> 26:38.920]  Obviously he understands it's too large an engagement.
[26:38.920 --> 26:40.680]  We're supposed to be winding down there.
[26:40.680 --> 26:41.680]  We're winding up.
[26:41.680 --> 26:48.480]  And their argument is this, Mr. President, when we leave, everything will collapse.
[26:48.480 --> 26:53.840]  It will all go to, and the problem is that will happen whether we leave tomorrow or
[26:53.840 --> 26:56.120]  whether we leave 15 years from now.
[26:56.120 --> 26:58.120]  What they're trying to do here won't work.
[26:58.120 --> 27:00.680]  And this is the sleight of hand of the neocons.
[27:00.680 --> 27:05.160]  And give people the date on this, I mean the time from when did this just happen?
[27:05.160 --> 27:09.000]  This was within the last 10 days, I'm told.
[27:09.000 --> 27:13.040]  The intrigue here in the Trump White House is extraordinary.
[27:13.040 --> 27:16.560]  They're like trying to get their parents to sign the report card, kind of slipping it
[27:16.560 --> 27:19.200]  over to them when they read the newspaper, not paying attention.
[27:19.200 --> 27:21.680]  That's the level of just grasping and grabbing.
[27:21.680 --> 27:23.640]  Let me give you some intel.
[27:23.640 --> 27:33.000]  They have these shift teams that are CIA folks with Green Berets and others that have been
[27:33.000 --> 27:36.080]  taken and put into private contractor positions.
[27:36.080 --> 27:38.000]  And they're going around on hunter killer teams.
[27:38.000 --> 27:45.280]  And of course that was in the news this week, but specifically it is Eric Prince's plan
[27:45.280 --> 27:49.640]  but integrated with the Pentagon's plan, because the Pentagon, as you know, wants tens of thousands
[27:49.640 --> 27:52.080]  more regular troops.
[27:52.080 --> 27:56.640]  And so now, I guess Trump didn't want people to know the real plan, but they are launching
[27:56.640 --> 28:01.400]  the operations with the paramilitary forces.
[28:01.400 --> 28:06.160]  And so the CIA is running big teams inside the country.
[28:06.160 --> 28:10.400]  Unbelievable, unbelievable.
[28:10.400 --> 28:12.880]  So what do you make of all this?
[28:12.880 --> 28:15.640]  Let me take a Marco Rubio moment.
[28:15.640 --> 28:19.960]  Yes, you've got Larry and Jonathan out right now from talking 20 hours a day.
[28:19.960 --> 28:25.440]  I'm really starting to lose my voice because I have been working with the media to try
[28:25.440 --> 28:31.680]  to understand what's transpired here in the deep state effort to undermine the president's
[28:31.680 --> 28:32.680]  order for full disclosure.
[28:32.680 --> 28:34.560]  And this is just incredible.
[28:34.560 --> 28:35.560]  Stay there and do a few more minutes.
[28:35.560 --> 28:37.240]  I'm going to let you go because of your voice.
[28:37.240 --> 28:40.240]  I want to look at the negatives that are here, but also the positives that we're winning
[28:40.240 --> 28:43.040]  intellectually and the country's coming back economically.
[28:43.040 --> 28:49.200]  But this could be a recovery that kill in the crib, so the fight is at a key moment
[28:49.200 --> 28:50.200]  right now.
[28:50.200 --> 28:58.720]  We've got to stay focused and hold steady and move forward on Alex Jones.

[32:23.280 --> 32:25.120]  offer this for maybe a month.

[33:01.800 --> 33:23.000]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[33:23.000 --> 33:37.360]  In the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[33:37.360 --> 33:41.720]  To really show you how fluid this is, last Friday the media said that Roger Stone and
[33:41.720 --> 33:47.920]  I were wrong that the president was not going to release any of the JFK files that were
[33:47.920 --> 33:54.320]  set to be released the next Thursday evening at midnight going into Friday morning.
[33:54.320 --> 33:58.440]  And the next morning the president tweeted exactly what we'd said, what he told Roger,
[33:58.440 --> 34:02.760]  that barring new information, he was looking at releasing them.
[34:02.760 --> 34:06.520]  And then last minute he says, yeah, they're coming out today and they go, oh, we can't,
[34:06.520 --> 34:07.520]  there's other stuff we found.
[34:07.520 --> 34:15.120]  He goes, okay, you got six months, but they just did that as one more time.
[34:15.120 --> 34:18.480]  And the president is about secrecy with military stuff, which is a smart thing to do.
[34:18.480 --> 34:20.440]  You don't want to tell your enemies what you're going to do.
[34:20.440 --> 34:25.760]  But this is 53 years ago, 91% of the American people in Gallup Bulls, believe there are
[34:25.760 --> 34:32.600]  multiple shooters, anyone that's serious knows that, we even know what happened with JFK.
[34:32.600 --> 34:33.880]  And so that's why this is so important.
[34:33.880 --> 34:36.720]  I want to play this clip and then go back to Roger Stone.
[34:36.720 --> 34:40.480]  This is Gorka who recently left the White House, one of the president's top advisors
[34:40.480 --> 34:46.000]  says deep state withholding of JFK files stinks to high heaven.
[34:46.000 --> 34:51.480]  And we've also got other clips here, again, where Lou Dobbs and others are saying this
[34:51.480 --> 34:52.480]  is outrageous.
[34:52.480 --> 34:53.480]  Here it is.
[34:53.480 --> 34:58.360]  Joining us tonight, former strategist, deputy assistant to President Trump, now the chief
[34:58.360 --> 35:03.560]  strategist for the Make America Great Again coalition, Dr. Sebastian Gorka, great to have
[35:03.560 --> 35:04.560]  you here.
[35:04.560 --> 35:05.560]  Thanks for having me, Lou.
[35:05.560 --> 35:08.160]  It is quite a day in Washington, DC.
[35:08.160 --> 35:14.480]  Let's start with the obvious, and that is the delay of these documents, which the president
[35:14.480 --> 35:16.400]  told us that we were going to have today.
[35:16.400 --> 35:24.000]  The law says we must have by midnight today, tonight, but which we will not have, instead
[35:24.000 --> 35:32.880]  only about 2,500 of 35,000 overall documents, some of which have been under seal for 50,
[35:32.880 --> 35:36.720]  imagine this, 54 years.
[35:36.720 --> 35:40.400]  First things first, let's dispense with the fake news.
[35:40.400 --> 35:45.480]  I was reading the Daily Mail on the way here that said, President Trump, you cover up with
[35:45.480 --> 35:46.920]  JFK documents.
[35:46.920 --> 35:49.240]  This has nothing to do with President Trump.
[35:49.240 --> 35:55.240]  This is the FBI and the CIA requesting to be able to redact some of the documents.
[35:55.240 --> 35:56.240]  To hell with them.
[35:56.240 --> 35:57.240]  Well, yeah.
[35:57.240 --> 35:58.240]  To hell with them.
[35:58.240 --> 36:06.520]  Why should we, our president, any administration put up with two agencies that are over the
[36:06.520 --> 36:12.840]  course of what would be now 25 years since some of these documents were sealed, they've
[36:12.840 --> 36:17.360]  had 25 years to do the right thing, cover assets, change methods.
[36:17.360 --> 36:22.960]  There's only two reasons that you would do that redaction right now.
[36:22.960 --> 36:28.240]  The reasons are you protect active operations or you protect sources and methods.
[36:28.240 --> 36:30.480]  Neither of those can be true 50 years later.
[36:30.480 --> 36:32.680]  So what is it something embarrassing?
[36:32.680 --> 36:37.800]  And we have seen in the last eight years, the rank politicization of both the bureau
[36:37.800 --> 36:39.440]  and the CIA under Brennan.
[36:39.440 --> 36:41.640]  So it really stinks to high health.
[36:41.640 --> 36:44.920]  And again, I don't want to toot our horn here for breaking it last week.
[36:44.920 --> 36:47.960]  But facts are facts, because they're always saying we're not credible.
[36:47.960 --> 36:52.000]  Main Street Media does that because they lie for a living, unless it's a few pockets of
[36:52.000 --> 36:57.200]  reality like Lou Dobbs, like you just heard, that they've got relegated over on Fox Business.
[36:57.200 --> 37:02.200]  Even though he had higher ratings than anybody ever did on CNN, it just shows how crazy it
[37:02.200 --> 37:03.200]  is.
[37:03.200 --> 37:07.000]  But I digress.
[37:07.000 --> 37:11.040]  That's exactly what we feared is that they would black it out because the president isn't
[37:11.040 --> 37:16.600]  down there in the CIA running all this himself, just like I'm not running the shipping department
[37:16.600 --> 37:17.600]  for our products.
[37:17.600 --> 37:21.140]  That's a mile away from my other office.
[37:21.140 --> 37:22.920]  And it's that's exactly what's happened.
[37:22.920 --> 37:26.880]  And I guarantee you when it comes out in six months, they're going to dip each piece of
[37:26.880 --> 37:29.440]  paper in big old buckets of black paint.
[37:29.440 --> 37:35.480]  We'll have Lee Harvey Osmond Wald met with just like Roger Stone said.
[37:35.480 --> 37:39.080]  So again, this is not the president's doing and we're not defending the president.
[37:39.080 --> 37:42.320]  This is what we predicted what happened, Stone.
[37:42.320 --> 37:46.480]  Interestingly enough, one of the things we learn in these documents is at least 40 journalists
[37:46.480 --> 37:50.440]  were on the direct payroll of the CIA.
[37:50.440 --> 37:51.840]  Oops.
[37:51.840 --> 37:57.080]  That's one of the reasons they're fighting so furiously to hide this because they most
[37:57.080 --> 37:59.880]  likely are paying journalists today.
[37:59.880 --> 38:03.040]  Secondarily, here's their big problem.
[38:03.040 --> 38:07.800]  The government, the official finding of the Warren Commission accepted by the U.S. government
[38:07.800 --> 38:13.680]  is that Lee Harvey Oswald did not kill Kennedy as the agent of a foreign country.
[38:13.680 --> 38:17.680]  That he was a nutty communist, but he wasn't working for the Russians.
[38:17.680 --> 38:22.920]  Ergo, how can any of this have national security implications?
[38:22.920 --> 38:23.920]  It's not possible.
[38:23.920 --> 38:27.760]  You think about that little problem for them.
[38:27.760 --> 38:33.320]  Beyond that, they are, I think, caught by surprise.
[38:33.320 --> 38:37.840]  That explains the stories late last week that said you and I were wrong.
[38:37.840 --> 38:39.120]  They had a leak.
[38:39.120 --> 38:42.920]  They thought they were going to get him to release nothing.
[38:42.920 --> 38:47.960]  They were surprised, I think, when he moved towards transparency.
[38:47.960 --> 38:49.880]  Then they came back and they hard-cased him.
[38:49.880 --> 38:54.960]  These 200 documents will kill agents on the ground, Mr. President, and he said, I need
[38:54.960 --> 38:56.960]  six months to look at this.
[38:56.960 --> 38:58.960]  I think he's skeptical of them.
[38:58.960 --> 39:00.760]  Read it in his tweets.
[39:00.760 --> 39:04.120]  He understood what the right thing to do here was.
[39:04.120 --> 39:11.400]  I think it is crucial to recognize that what they don't want the voters to figure out,
[39:11.400 --> 39:16.880]  the American people to figure out, is the same things they did then they are doing now,
[39:16.880 --> 39:18.880]  lying, promulgating fake news.
[39:18.880 --> 39:20.720]  By the way, these documents are incredible.
[39:20.720 --> 39:24.160]  It's got mockingbird stuff in there, buying off all these newspapers, and it says, we
[39:24.160 --> 39:27.280]  agree that the free press is essential, but we need to do this.
[39:27.280 --> 39:31.560]  There they are putting out the talking points for the mainstream media, just like they still
[39:31.560 --> 39:32.560]  do today.
[39:32.560 --> 39:39.680]  They say it's disinfo that Anderson Cooper's CIA, the guy's a robber baron heir, I know
[39:39.680 --> 39:43.080]  you know him, and he admittedly worked at the CIA.
[39:43.080 --> 39:49.760]  It's like seeing in saying that the Nazi collaborator, George Soros, was never a Nazi collaborator.
[39:49.760 --> 39:52.600]  He went on 60 minutes and said he was proud of it.
[39:52.600 --> 40:01.160]  Now, Anderson Cooper has been on my international best dress list that I publish at Stone Cold
[40:01.160 --> 40:05.800]  Truth and still are on sale every year for about four years, and I used to think he was
[40:05.800 --> 40:11.040]  a relatively objective journalist, but he's got off the deep end so badly for the whole
[40:11.040 --> 40:17.200]  Clinton-Obama narrative of things that I have really lost enormous respect for.
[40:17.200 --> 40:18.200]  Wow.
[40:18.200 --> 40:22.280]  Well, it's incredible that there is a lot of meat to what was released.
[40:22.280 --> 40:26.920]  No wonder they didn't want any of this released, how they were owning TV journalists and print
[40:26.920 --> 40:30.800]  journalists and controlling major newspapers, and how they were trying to shut down other
[40:30.800 --> 40:32.960]  newspapers reporting on it.
[40:32.960 --> 40:34.320]  I think this is a key thing.
[40:34.320 --> 40:38.680]  There are several stories today that correctly say that among these documents are proof that
[40:38.680 --> 40:46.040]  the KGB conducted their own extensive investigation into Kennedy's murder and concluded that it
[40:46.040 --> 40:48.560]  was orchestrated by Lyndon Baines Johnson.
[40:48.560 --> 40:54.360]  Now, that is all reflected in my book, The Man Who Killed Kennedy, The Case Against LBJ.
[40:54.360 --> 40:59.600]  It's all meticulously reported, and it has now been confirmed by the federal documents.
[40:59.600 --> 41:01.840]  By the way, you can go to Amazon.
[41:01.840 --> 41:08.520]  You can go to Books of Million Barnes and Noble soon, if not now, on the InfoWars
[41:08.520 --> 41:09.520]  channel.
[41:09.520 --> 41:11.080]  That's how you're a best-selling author and researcher on that.
[41:11.080 --> 41:12.080]  That's why we've got you on.
[41:12.080 --> 41:16.440]  I want to get St. John on again to break this down.
[41:16.440 --> 41:19.160]  We've only got about a minute left here.
[41:19.160 --> 41:21.680]  Look, globalism's in trouble.
[41:21.680 --> 41:23.040]  Countries are breaking away from it everywhere.
[41:23.040 --> 41:24.520]  The economy's coming back.
[41:24.520 --> 41:26.080]  We're having huge victories.
[41:26.080 --> 41:29.040]  The deep states getting hurt, as it turns out, everything they said we'd done with the
[41:29.040 --> 41:30.360]  Russians, they'd done.
[41:30.360 --> 41:35.000]  I don't see how they survive this politically unless session still keeps being weak, and
[41:35.000 --> 41:39.640]  we know the constellation of power in the White House, how the president is surrounded,
[41:39.640 --> 41:44.400]  and believe it or not, I guess Kelly's not the worst that's in there, but it's just a
[41:44.400 --> 41:48.040]  nightmare situation, and hopefully we'll be able to release soon the deep state plan to
[41:48.040 --> 41:51.760]  remove Trump because he needs to get that blueprint specifically, and I know you have
[41:51.760 --> 41:57.200]  that blueprint as well, but I know he's been warned of that blueprint, and so it's just
[41:57.200 --> 41:58.200]  very dismaying.
[41:58.200 --> 42:05.280]  You know, my sources tell me that at this point, the assistant attorney generals are
[42:05.280 --> 42:12.320]  around Jeff Sessions, and particularly the de facto attorney general, Ron Rosenstein,
[42:12.320 --> 42:19.120]  Hodel Sessions, but essentially make sure that nothing he orders happens.
[42:19.120 --> 42:24.120]  He was never allowed to pick his own assistant attorney generals, and nobody around him is
[42:24.120 --> 42:25.120]  a Trump loyalist.
[42:25.120 --> 42:26.600]  These are all deep state people.
[42:26.600 --> 42:30.200]  So he's a man in a tower, he's like Rapunzel, he's in charge of nothing.
[42:30.200 --> 42:36.800]  Exactly, and he's got his own weird notions about marijuana, and aspect, forfeiture, and
[42:36.800 --> 42:40.360]  so on, but he's not even in the play, at Rosenstein's point.
[42:40.360 --> 42:45.200]  So he's a patriot, but he's like from somewhere from the 1940s, he's got a big, giant, police
[42:45.200 --> 42:47.800]  state stripe down his back, and he's in La La Land.
[42:47.800 --> 42:49.400]  Roger Stone will talk to you again soon.
[42:49.400 --> 42:50.400]  Thank you so much.
[42:50.400 --> 42:51.400]  Thanks for being with us.
[42:51.400 --> 42:55.000]  That is exclusive info on the war, but we just broke down.
[42:55.000 --> 42:58.840]  Let's set down 50,000 more troops.
[42:58.840 --> 43:04.000]  More than 3,000 never-before-seen documents on the assassination of John F. Kennedy are
[43:04.000 --> 43:07.760]  to be released by the National Archives October 26.
[43:07.760 --> 43:12.360]  The still secret documents include more than 3,000 that have never been seen by the public,
[43:12.360 --> 43:17.080]  and more than 30,000 that have been released previously, but with heavy redactions.
[43:17.080 --> 43:22.000]  This means that thousands of formerly classified documents related to Kennedy's assassination
[43:22.000 --> 43:25.880]  will be unveiled, JFK scholars cannot wait.
[43:25.880 --> 43:29.560]  Longtime Trump advisor Roger Stone was on the Alex Jones show this week.
[43:29.560 --> 43:33.680]  He said he spoke directly to the president and urged him to release all the documents.
[43:33.680 --> 43:38.680]  However, Stone notes that the president is under tremendous pressure by the Central Intelligence
[43:38.680 --> 43:42.840]  Agency to delay the release of the documents for another 25 years.
[43:42.840 --> 43:45.280]  Stone said the issue is now transparency.
[43:45.280 --> 43:47.360]  What is the government hiding at this point?
[43:47.360 --> 43:53.520]  He believes the documents will show that JFK assassin Lee Harvey Oswald was trained, nurtured,
[43:53.520 --> 43:57.560]  and put in place by the CIA, Leigh Ann McAdoo, Infowars.com.

[46:52.400 --> 47:18.320]  public, so please take advantage of it today, support your own health and support the Infowar.
[47:18.320 --> 47:28.760]  You're lentlessly attacking the power structure, you're listening to Alex Jones.
[47:28.760 --> 47:34.200]  I've been scanning over this morning the thousands of pages and looking at what's
[47:34.200 --> 47:38.720]  been ferreted out by citizens online doing the research.
[47:38.720 --> 47:44.800]  It's beautiful to see how when I woke up at 5 a.m. this morning couldn't go back to
[47:44.800 --> 47:45.800]  sleep.
[47:45.800 --> 47:51.600]  Honestly, there were just hundreds of huge stories that had broken about Hoover saying
[47:51.600 --> 47:57.640]  cover it up, make it look like only Oswald did it, to the CIA controlling the media and
[47:57.640 --> 47:59.440]  running a cover-up.
[47:59.440 --> 48:02.040]  These are real documents that Trump ordered released.
[48:02.040 --> 48:08.400]  I'm actually surprised this much came out now that I've had time to concentrate on it.
[48:08.400 --> 48:13.920]  Can you imagine what's in the 200, first they were saying 300, now it's 200 files, can you
[48:13.920 --> 48:21.400]  imagine what's in the 200 files that's worse than this?
[48:21.400 --> 48:25.560]  We have this instant gratification society now where they've held all this back for
[48:25.560 --> 48:40.960]  43, 53, excuse me, almost 54 years, coming up next month it'll be 54 years, wow.
[48:40.960 --> 48:46.400]  And the president is doing what he said he would do and then the media spins it, oh,
[48:46.400 --> 48:50.200]  he went back, he reneged.
[48:50.200 --> 48:54.440]  He could find the cure to cancer and they'd complain about it.
[48:54.440 --> 48:59.040]  And again, I'm not just here to defend the president, it's just a breath of fresh air
[48:59.040 --> 49:03.880]  that he killed TPP and is going after political correctness and before I get into the real
[49:03.880 --> 49:12.400]  martial law preparations that are going on by criminal elements of the deep state that
[49:12.400 --> 49:18.640]  want to trigger an actual emergency and then come in in a pincer action as if they're trying
[49:18.640 --> 49:23.200]  to stop the emergency, trying to stop the terror attacks, trying to stop the unrest and use
[49:23.200 --> 49:29.240]  that to force the president out of office or use that as cover to assassinate.
[49:29.240 --> 49:32.520]  And I've had that intel for a while but it's starting to break in the news so I'm going
[49:32.520 --> 49:33.880]  to get to that next hour.
[49:33.880 --> 49:37.960]  Let me hit political correctness here though first.
[49:37.960 --> 49:42.440]  I've been saying for a decade that political correctness is about waging war on communication
[49:42.440 --> 49:46.840]  and getting people to be afraid to talk to each other and ending true diversity and melting
[49:46.840 --> 49:51.960]  pot and putting us all in little corporate controlled globalist groups like a prison.
[49:51.960 --> 49:55.720]  And you have the feds and the globalists that are the warden and we're all basically
[49:55.720 --> 50:01.160]  facing forces to our group, you can't have any cultural appropriation, you're not supposed
[50:01.160 --> 50:05.480]  to be a cowboy or an Indian at the Halloween deal, you're supposed to just be a basket
[50:05.480 --> 50:07.560]  case about what words you use.
[50:07.560 --> 50:12.520]  Well, all over the western world they're saying we're not going to teach the classics
[50:12.520 --> 50:19.200]  in English class because those were racist back then, Shakespeare, didn't know any slaves,
[50:19.200 --> 50:24.560]  there weren't any slaves in England when he was alive except serfs, white slaves.
[50:24.560 --> 50:26.800]  And it's just insane.
[50:26.800 --> 50:31.680]  And at Yale and everywhere else they're calling it decolonization.
[50:31.680 --> 50:35.120]  And so they're going to teach modern English and other languages.
[50:35.120 --> 50:39.960]  Yeah, let's go to Yale so we don't learn the classics.
[50:39.960 --> 50:43.280]  Well, Yale is extincting itself.
[50:43.280 --> 50:47.760]  And then I've got stacks of news here today, Teddy Roosevelt statue attack because he must
[50:47.760 --> 50:50.080]  be racist.
[50:50.080 --> 50:54.320]  And then everyone apologizes that Ellen DeGeneres gets slammed on Twitter over sexist tweet
[50:54.320 --> 50:58.360]  to Katy Perry because, you know, a woman can't tell another woman she's a good looking
[50:58.360 --> 50:59.360]  or whatever.
[50:59.360 --> 51:04.160]  It's just, they're making all that the crime while ignoring the pedophilia of the devil
[51:04.160 --> 51:06.440]  worship and all the rest of it.
[51:06.440 --> 51:10.120]  And then they got all these articles about men are hitting on women in the parliament
[51:10.120 --> 51:11.560]  and it's wrong.
[51:11.560 --> 51:16.280]  So again, they're extending that into Harvey Weinstein raping women reportedly.
[51:16.280 --> 51:18.600]  That's what all this hype's about.
[51:18.600 --> 51:23.120]  Meanwhile, though, Megan Kelly's ratings continue to tank, Megan Kelly ditch politics
[51:23.120 --> 51:24.560]  for morning television.
[51:24.560 --> 51:27.520]  Did she make a mistake?
[51:27.520 --> 51:33.400]  The reason I raised that, did she make a mistake?
[51:33.400 --> 51:41.400]  It's not something that even has to do with that.
[51:41.400 --> 51:46.440]  She destroyed herself when she went from being a teleprompter reading info babe that poses
[51:46.440 --> 51:51.520]  a conservative and uncloaked herself as a wannabe globalist bootlicker.
[51:51.520 --> 51:58.320]  That's why she's failing people hate her sources ESPN heading for more painful layoffs as their
[51:58.320 --> 52:04.560]  ratings continue to tank just like the NFL and they can't stop because it's a cult of
[52:04.560 --> 52:06.720]  leftist control.
[52:06.720 --> 52:11.120]  Time is cutting back again 50%.
[52:11.120 --> 52:17.080]  After another cut of 40% two years ago, we're expanding their imploding.
[52:17.080 --> 52:21.560]  That's why they're panicking.
[52:21.560 --> 52:29.840]  The third answer is just wage war against intellectualism and wage war against Shakespeare
[52:29.840 --> 52:34.600]  and wage war against all the other great classics.
[52:34.600 --> 52:36.120]  It's amazing.
[52:36.120 --> 52:41.080]  They are making real intellectual pursuit evil where people are like ignorant sabbages
[52:41.080 --> 52:46.280]  afraid of books or afraid of history or afraid of big words.
[52:46.280 --> 52:47.680]  This is their attack on the West.
[52:47.680 --> 52:52.080]  The globalists do not want to inform general public so they are making people superstitious
[52:52.080 --> 52:58.040]  about all forms of communication.
[52:58.040 --> 53:02.000]  As Gorka has said Donald Trump is the kryptonite of political correctness.
[53:02.000 --> 53:07.720]  We are the kryptonite standing up not being bullied wearing info wars t-shirts in public.
[53:07.720 --> 53:09.160]  Doesn't just support the broadcast.
[53:09.160 --> 53:13.920]  It's an act of defiance and you'll meet like minded people.
[53:13.920 --> 53:19.720]  It's time to put info wars on your barn or on your car or at least a mola on lobby to
[53:19.720 --> 53:21.480]  meet like minded people.
[53:21.480 --> 53:25.160]  You've got a lot of other big specials that are running as well at infowarstore.com and
[53:25.160 --> 53:26.840]  we need your financial support.
[53:26.840 --> 53:32.360]  So whether it's fluoride free, high quality, toothpaste implanted and pregnant with silver
[53:32.360 --> 53:36.800]  and iodine of the highest quality or whether it's anthroplex, talk about stamina, endurance,
[53:36.800 --> 53:37.800]  energy, 50% off.
[53:37.800 --> 53:39.280]  I want you to try it.
[53:39.280 --> 53:46.880]  It's all there infowarslife.com, infowarstore.com or triple 8253-3139 but before I go any further
[53:46.880 --> 53:53.720]  I just saw this old clip of John Wayne back in like 1976 and just what a real guy for
[53:53.720 --> 53:57.920]  folks I knew that knew him behind the scenes, just a regular guy with a shirt all unbuttoned
[53:57.920 --> 54:04.960]  out in the desert and he's just look I didn't get a lot of meals when I was growing up.
[54:04.960 --> 54:08.440]  You don't hear me complaining about it and he's saying I love everybody no matter what
[54:08.440 --> 54:13.760]  color you are but he goes it's a crutch to teach people their victims, ruins their lives
[54:13.760 --> 54:17.640]  and then that's all they become is the victimology and I've got Clipstraw seeing it in other
[54:17.640 --> 54:22.320]  places where they've got Don Lemon and others saying oh white's claim they're getting racially
[54:22.320 --> 54:24.240]  attacked that's impossible.
[54:24.240 --> 54:26.680]  Only blacks can be attacked and we own this.
[54:26.680 --> 54:28.680]  You don't want to own being a victim.
[54:28.680 --> 54:31.440]  You don't want to own having chips on your shoulder.
[54:31.440 --> 54:34.600]  You don't want to own being a fool.
[54:34.600 --> 54:36.360]  You want to come together.
[54:36.360 --> 54:42.800]  Here is the Duke from the grave just telling it like it is and just looking at how ridiculous
[54:42.800 --> 54:43.800]  it is.
[54:43.800 --> 54:46.960]  They want to cut your legs off and put it correct as folks and give you a pair of crutches.
[54:46.960 --> 54:47.960]  Here it is.
[54:47.960 --> 54:53.360]  His patriotism has never wavered but today he's a little disillusioned with modern America.
[54:53.360 --> 54:59.840]  We're being represented by men who are countowing to minorities where they can get votes and
[54:59.840 --> 55:10.280]  I think it's bad for our country and I'm sad to see minorities make so much of themselves
[55:10.280 --> 55:11.800]  as a hyphenated American.
[55:11.800 --> 55:18.880]  I wish they'd all get to thinking that they're Americans as they should and as if luckily
[55:18.880 --> 55:26.520]  been born here and couldn't be better off in any other place they shouldn't be so much
[55:26.520 --> 55:28.240]  whining and belly aching.
[55:28.240 --> 55:33.360]  In the late 60s and early 70s there was a period of considerable change.
[55:33.360 --> 55:36.400]  Civil rights for blacks, equal rights for women.
[55:36.400 --> 55:38.120]  Has this made America a better place?
[55:38.120 --> 55:44.640]  I am saddened by the fact that although we were a matriarchy I think we will not be any
[55:44.640 --> 55:45.640]  longer.
[55:45.640 --> 55:53.080]  I think opening doors and tipping your hat to ladies is probably a thing of the past.
[55:53.080 --> 56:02.440]  The forerunners of the women's liberation of today have taken that feeling away from
[56:02.440 --> 56:05.440]  the average American man.
[56:05.440 --> 56:08.240]  But what about the civil rights?
[56:08.240 --> 56:10.480]  What about the civil rights?
[56:10.480 --> 56:13.320]  Well we have 20 million blacks on this continent.
[56:13.320 --> 56:18.640]  It was necessary to extend rights to them that perhaps for the first 199 years were denied
[56:18.640 --> 56:21.400]  them in this free America.
[56:21.400 --> 56:31.120]  I guess that they've had a pretty tough break but not quite as bad as you and your do-gooder
[56:31.120 --> 56:33.200]  friends would have believed.
[56:33.200 --> 56:37.080]  They live as well here as they live in any other country.
[56:37.080 --> 56:44.240]  Over that 199 years true I think they do have a right to more rights but it isn't a thing
[56:44.240 --> 56:51.000]  where the rest of the country should feel terribly guilty about anything because they
[56:51.000 --> 56:55.400]  have had a better life here and their fathers and mothers and they would have had any place
[56:55.400 --> 57:00.240]  else.
[57:00.240 --> 57:04.160]  And I want to see them have everything.
[57:04.160 --> 57:11.200]  I don't just walk and cry baby and say jeez I had to go without meals when I was 16 and
[57:11.200 --> 57:12.200]  17 years old.
[57:12.200 --> 57:14.240]  It's a terrible thing.
[57:14.240 --> 57:20.980]  I don't think that you should look back and whine and belly ache or try to hold somebody
[57:20.980 --> 57:24.160]  else guilty for everything.
[57:24.160 --> 57:27.160]  John Wayne and notice what he said there.
[57:27.160 --> 57:31.400]  General Kelly said we should put women on a pedestal and they said oh that's a horrible
[57:31.400 --> 57:32.400]  crime.
[57:32.400 --> 57:37.920]  No no no put women down down again we should put everybody on a pedestal humanity we should
[57:37.920 --> 57:41.680]  respect ourselves but that's not what they want they want to break us up and they're
[57:41.680 --> 57:49.280]  doing it they are slim they are scum they want to psychically rape everyone.

[59:51.840 --> 01:00:18.840]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[01:00:18.840 --> 01:00:35.480]  It's Friday.
[01:00:35.480 --> 01:00:39.320]  I'm going to open the phones up at the bottom of the hour with the balance and the broadcast.
[01:00:39.320 --> 01:00:43.360]  First time callers, long time callers, all I ask is you've got a good phone to get into
[01:00:43.360 --> 01:00:49.400]  the JFK files to get into the DOD plan Solar Storm based National Blackout Drill during
[01:00:49.400 --> 01:00:53.400]  Antifa protests in November that's tied in because it's believed they might actually
[01:00:53.400 --> 01:00:58.720]  attack the grid that some of the things are training to do along with the Jihadis.
[01:00:58.720 --> 01:01:04.320]  And then I've got a bunch of other news here that gets into what's happening in North Korea
[01:01:04.320 --> 01:01:09.160]  and a lot of other fronts but I was just thinking during the break how Yale is basically saying
[01:01:09.160 --> 01:01:12.600]  that the English language is racist.
[01:01:12.600 --> 01:01:15.800]  What it is, it's the dominant world language that every other government is teaching their
[01:01:15.800 --> 01:01:23.120]  people how to use so they're trying to hobble students and they're also trying to basically
[01:01:23.120 --> 01:01:29.920]  put a ball and chain around them and just direct that when you go get a degree in English
[01:01:29.920 --> 01:01:32.120]  that you don't study William Shakespeare.
[01:01:32.120 --> 01:01:36.680]  Of course, if you read Shakespeare you'll be anti-establishment.
[01:01:36.680 --> 01:01:42.560]  It's Renaissance literature that's super powerful, some of the best writing out there.
[01:01:42.560 --> 01:01:47.360]  But I mean if they have their way they're going to ban Charles Dickens in fact they're
[01:01:47.360 --> 01:01:52.480]  saying he's a bad guy because Charles Dickens is real sophisticated makes a lot of sense
[01:01:52.480 --> 01:01:55.160]  it teaches you how the world works.
[01:01:55.160 --> 01:02:01.640]  They don't want people to read Charles Dickinson because it's powerful, it'll make you want
[01:02:01.640 --> 01:02:07.400]  to be a good person, it's classical liberal thinking, the counterfeit liberals just like
[01:02:07.400 --> 01:02:11.120]  Glenn Beck would try to get me kicked off radio and try to get my affiliates taken away because
[01:02:11.120 --> 01:02:18.680]  he was trying to absorb my audience, he was the pod person, the body snatcher, he needs
[01:02:18.680 --> 01:02:23.000]  to get rid of the original to be the facsimile.
[01:02:23.000 --> 01:02:29.760]  He didn't finish absorbing me, in fact he didn't even really get my pinky, such a phony
[01:02:29.760 --> 01:02:35.800]  three dollar bill but that's what they're doing and they're trying to assimilate everything.
[01:02:35.800 --> 01:02:41.680]  They are 180 degrees for Martin Luther King saying it's not about what color you are,
[01:02:41.680 --> 01:02:46.280]  it's what you stand for, what you do and what you produce, that's Martin Luther King at
[01:02:46.280 --> 01:02:54.560]  one point and then at the polar opposite 180 degrees the other way you've got the SJW
[01:02:54.560 --> 01:03:00.520]  saying it's all about what group you are and who you are and by the way if you're a black
[01:03:00.520 --> 01:03:06.640]  person don't wear a cowboy hat and if you're a white person don't, you know you got curly
[01:03:06.640 --> 01:03:13.280]  hair don't grow it out long or whatever, it's insane, it's mental illness to tell you how
[01:03:13.280 --> 01:03:17.760]  you're supposed to look and what you're supposed to do, that is a cult and I forgot all over
[01:03:17.760 --> 01:03:29.760]  the country they've come out and said that trigonometry, calculus, algebra is white privilege
[01:03:29.760 --> 01:03:42.400]  and so mathematics created by the Chinese and by the Sumerians and by the Greeks, everybody
[01:03:42.400 --> 01:03:49.360]  created their own alphabets their own forms of math, that's racist and see I'm not joking
[01:03:49.360 --> 01:03:54.360]  if you're a new listener and you think that's too far they didn't really do that, no that's
[01:03:54.360 --> 01:04:03.280]  real, mathematics itself operates as whiteness, yeah I tell that to the Indian mathematicians,
[01:04:03.280 --> 01:04:11.600]  that's crazy folks, there's nothing, I mean mathematics is simply equations to understand
[01:04:11.600 --> 01:04:17.400]  how matter interacts and how to add things up, a cash register is not racist but again
[01:04:17.400 --> 01:04:25.160]  this is the total mental illness and they mean business, they are just creating fruit
[01:04:25.160 --> 01:04:36.360]  loop crazies at these college campuses and they know, now they're CNN, math is racist
[01:04:36.360 --> 01:04:44.520]  and men and women being together it's inherently bad because there's some friction there
[01:04:44.520 --> 01:04:51.440]  meanwhile, they don't want to talk about those dungeons where they got those kidnapped
[01:04:51.440 --> 01:04:58.440]  little kids, that's who they are.

[01:06:12.040 --> 01:06:28.720]  I
[01:06:28.720 --> 01:06:32.880]  cannot believe that during the break I'm actually having a straight face conversation with my
[01:06:32.880 --> 01:06:42.080]  great crew about all these top engineers at top schools who are white, who are black,
[01:06:42.080 --> 01:06:49.640]  who are women, who are, you name it, coming out and saying mathematics is racist, clocks
[01:06:49.640 --> 01:06:56.360]  are racist, Shakespeare is racist because he lived in a time when colonialism was being
[01:06:56.360 --> 01:07:03.600]  watched and I'm like what? I mean if one African tribe takes over the next African tribe,
[01:07:03.600 --> 01:07:09.960]  that's colonialism. The idea of people expanding and things is just like it's a white thing,
[01:07:09.960 --> 01:07:19.680]  is just unbelievable how these colleges literally give you a degree in mental illness now. University
[01:07:19.680 --> 01:07:24.800]  of Illinois, one of the top engineering schools in the country and that perpetuates white
[01:07:24.800 --> 01:07:34.200]  privilege. And now all over the country and colleges and in high schools and elementary
[01:07:34.200 --> 01:07:40.320]  schools they're giving people good grades because well we have fuzzy math, I remember
[01:07:40.320 --> 01:07:43.440]  hearing about fuzzy math 20 years ago and I thought they'll never really do that and
[01:07:43.440 --> 01:07:48.400]  then the common core had two plus two equals five and then we got copies of real common
[01:07:48.400 --> 01:07:53.400]  core where they're teaching first graders that two plus two can equal whatever you want
[01:07:53.400 --> 01:08:01.360]  and letting you still have your grade as an A plus even though you missed half the questions.
[01:08:01.360 --> 01:08:15.240]  I mean that is sabotage of humanity. Meanwhile, we've got the entire Russiagate narrative
[01:08:15.240 --> 01:08:21.520]  coming out and it's worse than we thought with the Clintons and their entire group of
[01:08:21.520 --> 01:08:27.240]  Democrats. I mean hundreds of prominent Democrats getting individually tens of millions from
[01:08:27.240 --> 01:08:32.040]  the Russians. I mean the Russians were just wholesale buying the Democratic Party so of
[01:08:32.040 --> 01:08:35.760]  course the Democrats get scared they go oh my gosh Trump's got in, he's about to get in,
[01:08:35.760 --> 01:08:39.720]  what do we do? Just totally just start saying Russia, Russia, Russia, Russia. To the point
[01:08:39.720 --> 01:08:48.440]  of I walked down the street in Austin and every 20th person I demonstrated it again
[01:08:48.440 --> 01:08:55.920]  Monday. I walked around for an hour and every 20th person or so just as I predicted would
[01:08:55.920 --> 01:09:01.160]  go FU and I heard a few go back to Russia's being screamed at me and people rolled on
[01:09:01.160 --> 01:09:06.800]  their windows to scream FU traitor. I'd say how am I a traitor? Then go you know you Russian.
[01:09:06.800 --> 01:09:14.160]  I mean you talk about mental patients folks. Hillary, we're now learning Democrats hundreds
[01:09:14.160 --> 01:09:25.280]  of millions. From the Russians for Uranium One, payoffs, everything. Here's Paul Watson's
[01:09:25.280 --> 01:09:29.200]  report on it. We're going to come back if the number starts taking some calls but here's
[01:09:29.200 --> 01:09:35.320]  Paul Joseph Watson's powerful report BS Russian collusion narrative collapses. Here is the
[01:09:35.320 --> 01:09:42.160]  PJW. So how's that Russian collusion narrative working out for you? It's completely collapsed.
[01:09:42.160 --> 01:09:50.120]  Russian is colluding with Russia except Trump. Basically you've got the Podesta group, you've
[01:09:50.120 --> 01:09:56.520]  got the Hillary campaign, you've got the DNC, you've got the FBI. Colluding with the Russians
[01:09:56.520 --> 01:10:02.800]  to dig up dirt on your political opponents to try to influence an election is bad, right?
[01:10:02.800 --> 01:10:07.800]  Really bad. I mean when Don Jr. met with that Russian lawyer, the media went nuts. That
[01:10:07.800 --> 01:10:12.840]  was treason. Yes, treason. We're now beyond obstruction of justice in terms of what's
[01:10:12.840 --> 01:10:18.560]  being investigated. This is moving into perjury, false statements, and even in a potentially
[01:10:18.560 --> 01:10:22.560]  treason. Bordering on treason as well. The president himself is bordering on treason
[01:10:22.560 --> 01:10:28.000]  because all of them have sought out damaging information about Hillary Clinton from the
[01:10:28.000 --> 01:10:37.240]  Russians. This is the scariest thing I've seen in my life in politics. This is evidence
[01:10:37.240 --> 01:10:43.680]  of willingness to commit collusion. He's saying, yes, I had the intent to collude. I went in,
[01:10:43.680 --> 01:10:49.040]  I took the meeting, which by definition is colluding. A senior advisor and someone who
[01:10:49.040 --> 01:10:56.120]  was in the top tier of the Trump campaign colluded. How did the media react to confirmation
[01:10:56.120 --> 01:11:02.320]  that Hillary, the DNC and Obama's FBI colluded with Russia to fund the fake Trump Piscay
[01:11:02.320 --> 01:11:07.320]  dossier and then lied about their involvement for a whole year while pointing the finger
[01:11:07.320 --> 01:11:13.200]  at Trump for Russian collusion with no evidence? While that same establishment media helped
[01:11:13.200 --> 01:11:18.720]  them promote the lauded fake Trump Piscay dossier. Well, how do you think they reacted?
[01:11:18.720 --> 01:11:24.440]  They buried it. They downplayed it. Despite it being the biggest story of the day by far,
[01:11:24.440 --> 01:11:32.400]  ABC devoted just 31 seconds to it at the end of a story about a separate issue. 31 seconds.
[01:11:32.400 --> 01:11:36.680]  Compare that to their coverage of Trump Jr's meeting, which on the day it broke ran for
[01:11:36.680 --> 01:11:42.240]  over 10 minutes. CNN took it down here while giving top billing to a far less important
[01:11:42.240 --> 01:11:47.560]  story about WikiLeaks. How did the media react to the bombshell revelations about Hillary
[01:11:47.560 --> 01:11:53.600]  Clinton and the Obama administration colluding with Russia in the uranium one scandal? Despite
[01:11:53.600 --> 01:12:00.120]  it being the biggest story of the last week, CNN devoted an entire three minutes, 54 seconds
[01:12:00.120 --> 01:12:07.160]  to it over the course of seven days. But hey, at least they did better than ABC, CBS or NBC,
[01:12:07.160 --> 01:12:12.280]  who devoted no time to it whatsoever. Oh, but the media's not controlled. Oh, no. Keith
[01:12:12.280 --> 01:12:17.880]  Olberman, who's been frothing at the mouth about Russia for the past year. Scum. Russian
[01:12:17.880 --> 01:12:25.160]  scum is now triggered that Trump won't shut up about Russia. Oh, the sweet, sweet irony.
[01:12:25.160 --> 01:12:29.920]  How did left wing pundits and celebs react to Trump Jr meeting the Russian lawyer? Joy
[01:12:29.920 --> 01:12:35.520]  Reed, Nick Confessori, Alyssa Milano, Matthew Chapman, they all freaked out. Colluding with
[01:12:35.520 --> 01:12:41.320]  the Russians to do opposition research was dreadful. Maybe even an imprisonable offense.
[01:12:41.320 --> 01:12:47.400]  How did those very same people react to Hillary and the Dems colluding with the Russians to
[01:12:47.400 --> 01:12:51.280]  do opposition research? Only the American media could make a scandal out of opposition
[01:12:51.280 --> 01:12:55.320]  research. Let the party who has never peddled up her research cast the first stone. Honest
[01:12:55.320 --> 01:12:59.080]  questions, does it matter who funded it? It's campaign research, isn't campaign research
[01:12:59.080 --> 01:13:02.960]  normal? CNN GOP ruined the lives of scammed bets and identities that victims tonight media's
[01:13:02.960 --> 01:13:07.400]  top story, Hillary Clinton did opposition research. So Trump Jr having some useless meeting
[01:13:07.400 --> 01:13:11.720]  with a Russian lawyer, that's awful. The Democratic Party and the Clinton campaign
[01:13:11.720 --> 01:13:17.920]  scheming with the FBI to collude with the Russians by producing a fake dossier to influence
[01:13:17.920 --> 01:13:23.240]  the election. That's just fine. How did the media react when Trump tweeted a week ago
[01:13:23.240 --> 01:13:27.840]  that Hillary, the FBI and the Democratic Party were probably behind the Piscay dossier?
[01:13:27.840 --> 01:13:33.960]  CNN said he was floating conspiracy theories. CNN reporters ridiculed him. Never Trump has
[01:13:33.960 --> 01:13:39.640]  said he was a disgrace. And yet, Trump has been proven completely right. He's totally
[01:13:39.640 --> 01:13:44.080]  vindicated. Just like when they called him crazy for saying his campaign was wiretapped
[01:13:44.080 --> 01:13:48.520]  and he was proven completely right about that too. So Hillary engaged in the dirtiest
[01:13:48.520 --> 01:13:53.840]  of dirty tricks. Oh, by the way, we told you this whole Russian collusion narrative was
[01:13:53.840 --> 01:13:59.880]  completely fake 10 months ago. So either Russia has suddenly launched a coordinated effort
[01:13:59.880 --> 01:14:05.280]  to sabotage Western Democratic elections or the unpopular leaders of those countries
[01:14:05.280 --> 01:14:12.040]  have suddenly launched a coordinated propaganda campaign to blame Russia for absolutely everything
[01:14:12.040 --> 01:14:18.920]  to distract voters from their own failed policies. And at the end of it all, after all the hysteria,
[01:14:18.920 --> 01:14:24.320]  all the pearl clutching, all the promises of impeachment, all the investigations, the
[01:14:24.320 --> 01:14:31.120]  only real evidence of Russian collusion was that conducted by Obama's FBI, the DNC and
[01:14:31.120 --> 01:14:36.560]  Hillary Clinton let that sink in. That's right. Everyone in the Democratic Party,
[01:14:36.560 --> 01:14:40.960]  as they've been doing since they invaded Russia in 1917, Democratic Party, literally
[01:14:40.960 --> 01:14:45.440]  out of New York and then funding out of London, sent 100,000 New Yorkers who were formerly
[01:14:45.440 --> 01:14:50.640]  from Russia over to take over and set up what they couldn't get done here. Communism was
[01:14:50.640 --> 01:14:56.000]  big in 1917 here. It was so dangerous, basically got outlawed for a while. And then they marched
[01:14:56.000 --> 01:15:00.320]  back over and just took over Russia and started just slaughtering any Christians they could
[01:15:00.320 --> 01:15:06.120]  get their hands on. So that's the bottom line of communism, folks. It is a liberal anti-Christian
[01:15:06.120 --> 01:15:12.520]  anti-famovement that has always meant to do what it's now doing. Very, very powerful

[01:17:54.520 --> 01:18:00.880]  Dr. Group, you developed Living Defense for us. It took you over a year to do it. Why
[01:18:00.880 --> 01:18:02.600]  is this so good?
[01:18:02.600 --> 01:18:07.240]  Because people are actually waking up to the problem that pretty much scares me the most.
[01:18:07.240 --> 01:18:11.920]  I mean, I try to make sure that I don't put toxins from food and water and beverages in
[01:18:11.920 --> 01:18:17.600]  my system, but right now we're dealing with massive parasites, which is anything that's
[01:18:17.600 --> 01:18:23.240]  harmful to your body that lives off a host mechanism. Right now, with all the refugees
[01:18:23.240 --> 01:18:27.800]  spreading disease around, we have biological warfare going on everywhere. These are all
[01:18:27.800 --> 01:18:28.800]  parasites.
[01:18:28.800 --> 01:18:31.040]  Tell us about all the stuff that says there's so many things that are in it.
[01:18:31.040 --> 01:18:36.000]  You have the neem in there. You have the organic clove bud, the organic wormwood. I recommend
[01:18:36.000 --> 01:18:38.680]  doing the parasite plans at least twice a year.
[01:18:38.680 --> 01:18:41.840]  All right. Well, I'm glad we've got some back in because I'm going back on it today. It
[01:18:41.840 --> 01:18:45.720]  just came back in yesterday. Living Defense, infowarslife.com. And folks, you can't lose

[01:20:07.760 --> 01:20:30.000]  The Alex Jones Show. Because there is a war on for your mind.
[01:20:30.000 --> 01:20:47.280]  Online we are living in incredible times right now. Undoubtedly, the left is the very same
[01:20:47.280 --> 01:20:54.640]  left they were 100 years ago. If you go back to the New York Times and the Washington Post
[01:20:54.640 --> 01:21:06.560]  in 1917, they were writing glowing reports of the wonderful Americans, Russian immigrants
[01:21:06.560 --> 01:21:15.040]  who were many of them Jewish, who were getting as leftist on the ships to travel at the end
[01:21:15.040 --> 01:21:24.320]  of World War I to go after the evil monarchy. They were like George Washington fighting
[01:21:24.320 --> 01:21:31.120]  King George III. The corrupt czars, even though the czars had just fought on the US
[01:21:31.120 --> 01:21:39.920]  British side in World War I in their weakened state, leftist powers in London and in New
[01:21:39.920 --> 01:21:47.760]  York financed with hundreds of millions of dollars at that time including Stalin's famous
[01:21:47.760 --> 01:21:59.680]  train of gold with 25 million dollars from the US Treasury shipped right in to Moscow.
[01:21:59.680 --> 01:22:05.040]  And the minute they got control of Russia four years later because it took them that
[01:22:05.040 --> 01:22:10.160]  time, every Christian they could get their hands on was sent to a slave camp or killed.
[01:22:10.160 --> 01:22:16.240]  And it was so enjoyable for the left and they got to break up the family and reorganize
[01:22:16.240 --> 01:22:23.040]  society and ban the churches and just do all the things they're trying to do here.
[01:22:23.040 --> 01:22:30.960]  Isn't that just sweet? And that's a historical fact. So when you see a leftist at a university
[01:22:30.960 --> 01:22:36.480]  or other places, they're cold-blooded folks. I learned this because I would have leftist
[01:22:36.480 --> 01:22:41.440]  on as guest. I would have them here. Rob Dewsman in some of the meetings be at dinner with
[01:22:41.440 --> 01:22:46.000]  people that claim they're just liberal. They say, listen, I like the fact that you don't
[01:22:46.000 --> 01:22:49.840]  like the Republican establishment, but you libertarians better become libertarian socialists
[01:22:49.840 --> 01:22:56.120]  because we're going to kill everybody on board when we take power. And you know, over the
[01:22:56.120 --> 01:23:01.000]  years, covering communist meetings, reading their literature, seeing them on the street,
[01:23:01.000 --> 01:23:04.760]  every time I've seen a group of communists out handing out literature or running a table,
[01:23:04.760 --> 01:23:08.560]  they won't talk to you until your camera's off and they walk over. Old ladies, old men,
[01:23:08.560 --> 01:23:13.240]  they'll go, we're going to kill you and everybody like you when we take control. You understand?
[01:23:13.240 --> 01:23:17.040]  They look at you and they go, yeah, there's going to be blood. And they're always like
[01:23:17.040 --> 01:23:25.120]  cockroaches, weak, ugly, stupid, hateful, but they got an instinct, boy, to get you in
[01:23:25.120 --> 01:23:31.200]  a death camp and starve you to death with your family. They love it. I mean, they want
[01:23:31.200 --> 01:23:36.040]  to kill you and your family. They want to murder all the police. They want to burn down success.
[01:23:36.040 --> 01:23:40.320]  They want to just shut the churches down and they want everybody to have to bow down to
[01:23:40.320 --> 01:23:47.640]  them. And under their system, you'll have maybe one pair of overalls with holes in it.
[01:23:47.640 --> 01:23:53.440]  You're going to work 18 hours a day. You're going to go to all these little commie meetings
[01:23:53.440 --> 01:23:58.520]  and have them over here running your life. You go read 1984. That's what Stalinism was
[01:23:58.520 --> 01:24:05.560]  like. And George Arwell had been a communist. One of the leaders of the Fabian Socialist,
[01:24:05.560 --> 01:24:12.960]  Eric Blair, he gave the entire list of the Communist Party before he died was probably
[01:24:12.960 --> 01:24:21.840]  poisoned to death in 1948. He gave the entire list of the Communist, the government and
[01:24:21.840 --> 01:24:29.600]  he said, you need to shut this down. They plan to end the family. They plan to dehumanize.
[01:24:29.600 --> 01:24:36.400]  They plan to even end the act of sex between men and women using feminism. He said, it's
[01:24:36.400 --> 01:24:42.200]  so horrible. I can't believe it. They were there. They're a priesthood of power who just
[01:24:42.200 --> 01:24:49.560]  want to torture people to death. No, you go read that book, ladies and gentlemen, and
[01:24:49.560 --> 01:24:56.920]  you understand Eric Blair was O'Brien and was Winston. He, he wore both those hats,
[01:24:56.920 --> 01:25:05.840]  ladies and gentlemen. Eric Blair tortured people. Eric Blair killed people. Eric Blair,
[01:25:05.840 --> 01:25:14.440]  you read that book. He's O'Brien and he's also Winston. And you want to know what the
[01:25:14.440 --> 01:25:24.320]  communists want to do to you? They want to hurt humanity because it's a sick cuckolding.
[01:25:24.320 --> 01:25:30.400]  It's the extreme of a guy that wants to watch 10 guys with his wife and have her tell him
[01:25:30.400 --> 01:25:40.160]  he's pathetic while it happens. Now, some men are into that. Globalism is a satanic
[01:25:40.160 --> 01:25:48.560]  death cult of people that want to feed on other people and hurt other people and have
[01:25:48.560 --> 01:25:54.200]  strong men and women, the very best in society brainwashed under their control. And when
[01:25:54.200 --> 01:25:59.440]  they're done with them, hang them up by their heels and torture them to death because they're
[01:25:59.440 --> 01:26:03.720]  threatened by a big, strong, powerful man that's already done service to them. But when they're
[01:26:03.720 --> 01:26:08.840]  through, just like the horse and animal farm that helped bring them to power, the pigs
[01:26:08.840 --> 01:26:18.080]  that load him up on an ox cart and ship him to a glue factory. You could allegories in
[01:26:18.080 --> 01:26:25.520]  what Orwell told you is what someone inside their system did. He worked for the empire
[01:26:25.520 --> 01:26:29.200]  and was an imperial policeman and did bad things. So he became a communist thinking,
[01:26:29.200 --> 01:26:40.320]  oh, that's the other side. I'll fix it being a communist. Then he found out it was even
[01:26:40.320 --> 01:26:47.520]  worse. And then it was a dialectic. So there's no doubt you understand the average leftist
[01:26:47.520 --> 01:26:53.480]  walking down the street is either a mindless idiot, a slave, but more and more of them,
[01:26:53.480 --> 01:26:58.120]  they know they're little weak cowards, but they imagine them in their black uniforms
[01:26:58.120 --> 01:27:01.920]  and they've got us in camps and they're beaten us and tortured us and they've got all this
[01:27:01.920 --> 01:27:05.880]  everything's theirs and they're in charge of everything. Those people never put in charge.
[01:27:05.880 --> 01:27:22.880]  They're the first ones to get wiped out. It's the 100th anniversary of the Bolshevik Revolution.
[01:27:22.880 --> 01:27:25.960]  They told you since the 80s that communism didn't exist anywhere in the world, even
[01:27:25.960 --> 01:27:30.000]  though they now admit it's exploding on the rise. It's been quietly beavering away, calling
[01:27:30.000 --> 01:27:38.760]  itself anti-fascist, just like they would do in the 1917. And then they just flood out
[01:27:38.760 --> 01:27:47.080]  of their roach holes and they're planning to blow up transformers, to shoot cops and
[01:27:47.080 --> 01:27:55.200]  to kill public figures starting November 4th. And that there's going to be this big overthrow
[01:27:55.200 --> 01:27:58.680]  and you've got the Democratic Party pushing it and all these other subgroups and some of
[01:27:58.680 --> 01:28:02.520]  them are useful and some of them know what they're part of, others don't, but you read
[01:28:02.520 --> 01:28:07.040]  the socialist publications, the communist publications, they want a violent revolution.
[01:28:07.040 --> 01:28:14.160]  That's the hallmark of what they do. And the little spoiled rotten millennials with their
[01:28:14.160 --> 01:28:20.800]  slave phones made in China under that crony capitalist fascist regime, that's their model
[01:28:20.800 --> 01:28:28.880]  and they just dream as little soft stupid spoiled rotten nobodies of the power they're
[01:28:28.880 --> 01:28:38.720]  going to have in this big juicy bloodletting. Well, this is not 1917 Russia and I will assure
[01:28:38.720 --> 01:28:47.320]  you that this is going to be their big defeat. I will assure you they've met their water
[01:28:47.320 --> 01:28:54.320]  loop and I will assure you everything they think they're going to do to us is going to
[01:28:54.320 --> 01:28:56.880]  happen to them.

[01:31:58.720 --> 01:32:03.000]  You know someone very profoundly once said many years ago that if fascism ever comes
[01:32:03.000 --> 01:32:12.120]  to America it'll come in the name of liberalism.
[01:32:12.120 --> 01:32:18.320]  Welcome to The War Room, the latest expansion in Infowars live broadcasting. We are live
[01:32:18.320 --> 01:32:24.840]  weekdays from 3 to 6 PM central at Infowars.com slash show and this YouTube channel right
[01:32:24.840 --> 01:32:29.800]  here that you've landed on. Please subscribe to the channel for updates and notifications.
[01:32:29.800 --> 01:32:34.840]  You can follow us on Twitter at War Room Show. We are going to have the most powerful guest,
[01:32:34.840 --> 01:32:39.840]  the most powerful host. We'll be hearing from Alex Jones regularly as well as taking
[01:32:39.840 --> 01:32:44.400]  your phone calls. The liberal establishment media has controlled the narrative for too
[01:32:44.400 --> 01:32:59.400]  long. The silent majority is no longer silent. This is The War Room.
[01:32:59.400 --> 01:33:06.400]  We are listening to the Alex Jones show.
[01:33:29.400 --> 01:33:48.880]  I am one of the most hated pro-western individuals in the world, simply because I've actually
[01:33:48.880 --> 01:33:54.120]  studied the globalists and who they are and what they are. They are in open war against
[01:33:54.120 --> 01:34:01.440]  reality, against creation, against common sense, against the family because they seek to dominate
[01:34:01.440 --> 01:34:07.080]  and control. And it may seem crazy to see the left saying all math, clocks, science is
[01:34:07.080 --> 01:34:15.200]  racist, literature is racist, ban everything, don't teach English anymore, it's racist.
[01:34:15.200 --> 01:34:19.360]  Until you understand they are technicians that want to be cult leaders and they've got
[01:34:19.360 --> 01:34:25.440]  to train you to accept the absurd. You always hear about cults wanting people to go along
[01:34:25.440 --> 01:34:30.140]  with absurd ideas and things that don't make sense. You go, why do they have them do that?
[01:34:30.140 --> 01:34:34.880]  Because they want you to pass a litmus test and show you'll do anything to get people
[01:34:34.880 --> 01:34:38.960]  into a cult mentality so that you'll do more and more extreme things than they tell you
[01:34:38.960 --> 01:34:45.960]  to including blowing yourself up as a suicide bomber. And Islam in its orthodox form is
[01:34:45.960 --> 01:34:54.040]  a cult. The leftist movement is a cult and that's why it works so closely together. And
[01:34:54.040 --> 01:34:59.040]  the acolytes of it keep believing they're going to get this heavenly future if they
[01:34:59.040 --> 01:35:07.120]  just join it. I have known people that have told me, listen Alex, I can't handle the
[01:35:07.120 --> 01:35:11.160]  reality of the new world order. I know it's true. I'm deciding to join the matrix and
[01:35:11.160 --> 01:35:17.960]  just buy into it. And I'm going to go to wine houses and poetry things and just buy
[01:35:17.960 --> 01:35:22.960]  into loving Hillary. And again, they just go to the poetry deals and drink wine and
[01:35:22.960 --> 01:35:26.680]  then all just go, oh, we're intellectual, oh, we're intellectual and just repeat that
[01:35:26.680 --> 01:35:33.280]  over and over again. Well, they're the opposite. It's a cult of not having to think and just
[01:35:33.280 --> 01:35:38.040]  joining it and just, and then, oh, we have a job for you now. Oh, we're going to promote
[01:35:38.040 --> 01:35:46.840]  you now. You just want to totally turn yourself over to this. But that's only for this season.
[01:35:46.840 --> 01:35:52.880]  This is the end of humanity if the globalists are able to carry out their final technocracy
[01:35:52.880 --> 01:36:01.280]  plan. And so when I'm telling cult members of the left is you're at the end of the line,
[01:36:01.280 --> 01:36:09.640]  you are a schmuck, you are a sucker, you are a fool, involves a delusional thinking. And
[01:36:09.640 --> 01:36:14.680]  what you're pushing is a takeover culture. It's an overwrite culture. It won't be the
[01:36:14.680 --> 01:36:20.640]  operating system once the globalists get full control to be a very, very centralized, eugenics
[01:36:20.640 --> 01:36:26.000]  based fascist model. And in the dialectic, I even see them using your extreme behavior
[01:36:26.000 --> 01:36:33.200]  to actually bring in that fascist system of the dialectic. You are the fascism that will
[01:36:33.200 --> 01:36:41.080]  trigger fascism under the name fascism, but a more orderly fascism to counter you. You
[01:36:41.080 --> 01:36:50.200]  are morons, you are chumps, you are Marx, you are the prey, you are wrong, you have
[01:36:50.200 --> 01:36:55.480]  been conned, you have been lied to. And I'm not saying that with pleasure to feel intellectually
[01:36:55.480 --> 01:37:07.120]  superior to you, but you can't even talk on the street, you just scream F-U Russian.
[01:37:07.120 --> 01:37:11.000]  I want to go to Steve, I want to go to Kevin, I want to go to Scott, AJ, Carlos, and many
[01:37:11.000 --> 01:37:22.280]  many others. And what's happening is, just like when you see Keith Hubbard and everybody
[01:37:22.280 --> 01:37:28.040]  else going Russian scum, the filthy, dirty, horrible, evil Russians and mass murderers
[01:37:28.040 --> 01:37:31.680]  and they're the worst people on earth and they're the reason, I mean, that's Bill Maher,
[01:37:31.680 --> 01:37:39.480]  that's all of them. They're doing it, they're doing it, invoking the most hardcore form
[01:37:39.480 --> 01:37:51.280]  of racism. I mean, I mean, the Russians are a race of people.
[01:37:51.280 --> 01:37:59.960]  In a culture, in a Christian country, colonized by the left in 1917, that halfway crawled
[01:37:59.960 --> 01:38:03.960]  away with, you know, again, half its face torn off, and it's like trying to recuperate,
[01:38:03.960 --> 01:38:08.000]  doesn't mean it's perfect, and the face suckers are up against the window just trying to get
[01:38:08.000 --> 01:38:13.240]  in as fast as they can. George Soros is throwing everything he's got, 18 billion and bringing
[01:38:13.240 --> 01:38:20.560]  down the U.S. I mean, it was just insane asylum. And the face suckers are just snapping their
[01:38:20.560 --> 01:38:28.240]  teeth, just wanting into the room, just greedily going into complete psychotic ecstasy, but
[01:38:28.240 --> 01:38:32.040]  they're going to run out of energy. They're going to fall down on the ground and basically
[01:38:32.040 --> 01:38:35.720]  politically die, and that's happening. So right now, it's more like a temper tantrum.
[01:38:35.720 --> 01:38:41.360]  A lot of the face suckers are on the ground just going, it was supposed to be ours, Christian
[01:38:41.360 --> 01:38:50.240]  blood. They don't know what to do. We were supposed to be dominant. We're all a bunch
[01:38:50.240 --> 01:38:55.760]  of globalist hunchback, crazy scum. What are we going to do? We want to have paint, but
[01:38:55.760 --> 01:39:00.400]  the innocent's blood all over the walls. We want to orgy in their blood. We were promised
[01:39:00.400 --> 01:39:04.080]  it by our God. We're not getting it quick enough.
[01:39:04.080 --> 01:39:13.680]  I mean, you go to an Antifa event. They are the filthy, stupid, ugly, stinking piles of
[01:39:13.680 --> 01:39:20.440]  trash, and they know they are and they like it. And they're going to kill you if they
[01:39:20.440 --> 01:39:25.720]  get their hands around your neck because they're just a little frontline babies. Back in the
[01:39:25.720 --> 01:39:34.280]  shadows is their mommies, big spider-like pigwomen, pig men. Go to a communist meeting. I mean,
[01:39:34.280 --> 01:39:40.240]  you nasty, slimy, filthy, hateful people. They never buy each other anything. You all just
[01:39:40.240 --> 01:39:45.680]  clutch. They've all got like apartment houses and money and banks is filled with cash. Flithering
[01:39:45.680 --> 01:39:54.880]  around. They never pay taxes. They never just ever. And they attract all these chicken necks
[01:39:54.880 --> 01:40:01.600]  and cowards to join them for the promise of power when you'll be nothing but tread grease
[01:40:01.600 --> 01:40:11.040]  for the war engine's wheels. Just as I say this, there's search engine, everything I
[01:40:11.040 --> 01:40:17.000]  say, and it's just left us men weak. And I wouldn't even say physically weak. Weak mentally.
[01:40:17.000 --> 01:40:22.880]  Six times more likely to steal. What is it? Nine times more likely not to give a charity
[01:40:22.880 --> 01:40:29.480]  or am I flipping the numbers? And again, there's this thing of the week to pull down the strong.
[01:40:29.480 --> 01:40:34.600]  So first they convince the strong to let them run everything. And then you learn, no, they're
[01:40:34.600 --> 01:40:43.000]  actually want to have a ritual of demasculating us. And it's all an existential exercise of
[01:40:43.000 --> 01:40:47.240]  power. I promise we're going to your calls when we come back in the next segment to talk
[01:40:47.240 --> 01:40:53.280]  about this in a lot more. But and I'm not knocking men that aren't big and muscular.
[01:40:53.280 --> 01:40:58.240]  I think it's a statistical thing that that's the type of folks that they end up recruiting
[01:40:58.240 --> 01:41:04.600]  to authoritarianism many times. It's larger than that. And the culture does this to people.
[01:41:04.600 --> 01:41:09.080]  Most of the time, they're not even really evil at the grassroots level. They feel disempowered.
[01:41:09.080 --> 01:41:15.120]  They've been made to be fearful and broken down. And then they're inducted into the communism,
[01:41:15.120 --> 01:41:20.320]  into the authoritarianism, as if this will make you strong now, you've got to be nastier
[01:41:20.320 --> 01:41:36.320]  than they are. But the ones controlling it are always devil worshipers. If you see communist
[01:41:36.320 --> 01:41:42.120]  stickers on somebody's car and then you go in their house to do a repair job, I had several
[01:41:42.120 --> 01:41:48.920]  repair jobs. I worked for an exterminator off and on for a year. I worked for a carpet
[01:41:48.920 --> 01:41:54.160]  cleaning company. And you learn a lot on people's houses. And if you see communist stuff on
[01:41:54.160 --> 01:42:05.280]  a car, you don't see communist stuff inside. You see devil worship. And that's who these
[01:42:05.280 --> 01:42:13.240]  people are, folks. Potbellied pedophile devil worshipers. And all they want to do is run
[01:42:13.240 --> 01:42:17.920]  you into the ground because they hate you existing. They hate the fact you're good.
[01:42:17.920 --> 01:42:23.760]  They hate the fact you love God. They want to destroy you. Period. And they mean business.
[01:42:23.760 --> 01:42:30.840]  So just remember that. And they hate me because I see them and I know them. Now, if you want
[01:42:30.840 --> 01:42:34.000]  to fight back against these scum, we have a new limited edition t-shirt that we're only
[01:42:34.000 --> 01:42:40.840]  selling for a month. We've taken the stupid antifas logo and redid it. That we're anti-socialism
[01:42:40.840 --> 01:42:45.680]  and we're anti-fascism. And it's got the American flag and the Gadsden flag. It's really
[01:42:45.680 --> 01:42:51.560]  powerful. It's in the t-shirt section of infowarstore.com or call toll three triple
[01:42:51.560 --> 01:42:57.160]  eight two five three three one three nine, the anti-fascist, anti-communist shirt. I

[01:43:56.680 --> 01:44:02.400]  This week the FBI released over 1500 heavily redacted documents concerning the Sandy Hook
[01:44:02.400 --> 01:44:08.600]  investigation. In many cases entire pages are redacted but unredacted portions of the Sandy
[01:44:08.600 --> 01:44:13.960]  Hook documents continue to support the narrative. 20 year old shooter Adam Lanza was a lonely
[01:44:13.960 --> 01:44:19.440]  tech savvy high school dropout and experienced shooter with an interest in weapons, a functioning
[01:44:19.440 --> 01:44:24.920]  autistic with a personality disorder and a recluse who liked to play video games all day.
[01:44:24.920 --> 01:44:30.880]  But there's one key update on page 41 a source told agents that Lanza while in the 9th grade
[01:44:30.880 --> 01:44:36.760]  was visited at his home by either CIA or FBI agents after hacking a government computer
[01:44:36.760 --> 01:44:42.200]  system the source said authorities told Nancy Lanza that if her son was that smart he could
[01:44:42.200 --> 01:44:47.040]  have a job with them someday. Infowars has the documents read them right now they're
[01:44:47.040 --> 01:44:53.440]  posted in their entirety at the article. FBI releases heavily redacted Sandy Hook investigation

[01:47:53.060 --> 01:47:59.240]  article up at news wars.com that's a powerful headline I think it was just Hillary would
[01:47:59.240 --> 01:48:06.240]  face the electric chair if she got caught doing what she's done in the 50s that's right
[01:48:06.240 --> 01:48:12.440]  they would Rosenberg her faster than your head could spin Rosenberg's were executed
[01:48:12.440 --> 01:48:18.760]  for sharing US nuclear secrets with the Soviets Sebastian Gorka military analyst and former
[01:48:18.760 --> 01:48:23.040]  top a to president Trump compared potential high crimes involving the Obama administration
[01:48:23.040 --> 01:48:28.280]  DNC in Russia to those committed during the Cold War by the likes of Julius and Ethel
[01:48:28.280 --> 01:48:34.140]  Rosenberg who were convicted of espionage and executed via electric chair giving their
[01:48:34.140 --> 01:48:43.880]  communist cohorts in Russia the bomb just like I mean why not I mean they'd had family
[01:48:43.880 --> 01:48:50.080]  and friends and other New Yorkers few decades before go over to help take over Russia and
[01:48:50.080 --> 01:48:59.440]  carry out a good old jolly leftist extermination fun I mean this is left having fun there's
[01:48:59.440 --> 01:49:04.200]  nothing like shipping whole villages did forced labor camps for 10 years and then you know

[01:49:14.120 --> 01:49:19.120]  same career selling out our secrets to foreign powers communist China you name it and of course
[01:49:19.120 --> 01:49:22.360]  she's the globalist she's the enemy she's the one selling our country out so she points
[01:49:22.360 --> 01:49:28.680]  her finger at me by name and the president and you the American people she says you're
[01:49:28.680 --> 01:49:39.840]  idiots she says you're morons you voted for Trump because he you're a dupe of the Russians
[01:49:39.840 --> 01:49:47.280]  yeah right oh I love the new pumpkins that are out but I think I'm gonna try to rip
[01:49:47.280 --> 01:49:51.720]  that off everybody should use just every form of art to fight the globalist since the left
[01:49:51.720 --> 01:49:55.560]  one's Halloween band now because they say people express themselves and wear costumes
[01:49:55.560 --> 01:50:01.840]  they just want to run everything even though it's a cultic they don't like it but you
[01:50:01.840 --> 01:50:07.880]  could have it like Hillary you know lock her up and you have a little pumpkin inside the
[01:50:07.880 --> 01:50:15.080]  pumpkin and then you put up a little put up a little deal of bars like like like she's

[01:53:17.160 --> 01:53:23.640]  Tennessee cabinet in florida who's been holding the longest here let's talk to Carlos and
[01:53:23.640 --> 01:53:32.480]  montreal canada thanks for holding thank you alex just a comment when president uh...
[01:53:32.480 --> 01:53:38.040]  trump said that there was nothing he could do this was a very meaningful phrase to me
[01:53:38.040 --> 01:53:44.320]  because as you know we analyze on a semantic uh... phrases and white people say the things
[01:53:44.320 --> 01:53:50.240]  they say and it's not something that he would have said uh... for legal reasons or constitutional
[01:53:50.240 --> 01:53:56.400]  reasons because they're not essentially i believe it's because uh... the people that
[01:53:56.400 --> 01:54:02.800]  are going to be mentioned in in in those uh... documents are alive today and one in particular
[01:54:02.800 --> 01:54:09.160]  is uh... george herbert walker bush and his relationship uh... with the canada association
[01:54:09.160 --> 01:54:13.640]  is one that i happen to have come across a long time ago but on a different track altogether
[01:54:13.640 --> 01:54:19.520]  i was actually looking at uh... charles the gold some relationship in Quebec and what
[01:54:19.520 --> 01:54:26.040]  was happening here and it it turns out that uh... uh... agents of uh... french agents
[01:54:26.040 --> 01:54:31.480]  were actually operating uh... in texas in the in the uh... fort worth uh... midland
[01:54:31.480 --> 01:54:37.600]  Dallas area to talk about the jackal it well in particular uh... spelled by the name of
[01:54:37.600 --> 01:54:42.760]  michael uh... merits who was uh... uh... an assassin for the barbouzes of uh... you know
[01:54:42.760 --> 01:54:49.560]  the algerian uh... at the source with the goal and in particular heat this this fellow
[01:54:49.560 --> 01:54:57.680]  uh... actually was seen photograph with uh... with uh... people like uh... uh... i'm trying
[01:54:57.680 --> 01:55:03.080]  to recall specific here's what goes on when you get something like killing a president
[01:55:03.080 --> 01:55:07.440]  you get a bunch of groups mafia together foreign governments and then a bunch of people take
[01:55:07.440 --> 01:55:12.440]  parts of everyone's involved in implicated it's like julia caesar everybody's got stabbed
[01:55:12.440 --> 01:55:17.800]  to prove they're in the club and so that's why oklahoma city they didn't just have foundation
[01:55:17.800 --> 01:55:22.440]  u.s. foundations in the fb on the a tf there they had german intelligence and others helping
[01:55:22.440 --> 01:55:27.320]  plant the bombs so that so that because you know the germans are run by a leftist operation
[01:55:27.320 --> 01:55:31.520]  as well to blame the right wing so that they were all wouldn't tattle on each other so
[01:55:31.520 --> 01:55:35.640]  you know it's kind of pedophiles you know you gotta rate kids together to be in the club
[01:55:35.640 --> 01:55:40.400]  and so that's what they're doing there but in particular there is a relationship that
[01:55:40.400 --> 01:55:46.000]  i discovered which was troubling and that is uh... an agent uh... known to the french
[01:55:46.000 --> 01:55:52.600]  agents uh... george demoran shield who was in the oil business closely associated with
[01:55:52.600 --> 01:55:56.440]  george herbert walker but i mean george herbert walker bush became the head of the cia agent
[01:55:56.440 --> 01:56:01.520]  a few years later he was there using the family businesses cutouts an offshore drilling rigs
[01:56:01.520 --> 01:56:06.720]  and an operation mongoose and all of it and he's in fb i files uh... with jagger hoover
[01:56:06.720 --> 01:56:11.360]  uh... with the assassination so of course that's that those are the names uh... reportedly
[01:56:11.360 --> 01:56:16.160]  that are in the files and it shows how real these files are uh... that they held him back
[01:56:16.160 --> 01:56:19.680]  just look at what they've already released it's pretty bombshell
[01:56:19.680 --> 01:56:26.400]  yes but george uh... but but george demoran shield was that the fellow that introduced
[01:56:26.400 --> 01:56:33.560]  oswald got him the job in the in the repository building yes this is very troubling because
[01:56:33.560 --> 01:56:40.720]  this individual later on was one of the most uh... uh... interviewed uh... during the
[01:56:40.720 --> 01:56:44.920]  commissions and inquiries and when he was supposed to testify in the seventies he killed
[01:56:44.920 --> 01:56:50.760]  himself listen listen they had trees and signs all over texas and in texas it was the
[01:56:50.760 --> 01:56:55.240]  day they killed him there was people high-fiving themselves in downtown austin and dallas in
[01:56:55.240 --> 01:57:03.440]  places so i mean everybody knew i'm here in texas okay so i mean i've been on airplanes
[01:57:03.440 --> 01:57:08.600]  with well-known politicians where they're just bragging about it so i mean uh... lbj told
[01:57:08.600 --> 01:57:13.520]  us mistress tonight before i told i mean look look who they had in dallas uh... the night
[01:57:13.520 --> 01:57:20.240]  before nixon all the big wicks were here in a big mafia commission to go ahead because
[01:57:20.240 --> 01:57:27.240]  they'd they'd gotten scared and backed off in chicago and in miami and uh... the the
[01:57:27.240 --> 01:57:32.680]  the teams had just refused to kill the president but texas came through and that's what happened
[01:57:32.680 --> 01:57:37.000]  and you're absolutely right those people were all involved and for running part of the operation
[01:57:37.000 --> 01:57:41.360]  george overwalker bush was promoted to the head of the cia out of nowhere for helping
[01:57:41.360 --> 01:57:47.000]  carry out the operation to kill john f kennedy statements
[01:57:47.000 --> 01:57:51.400]  we've taken thousands of years of known research and put it together with our own four years
[01:57:51.400 --> 01:57:56.080]  of seeking and testing to find the very best systems that god gave us your mother nature

[02:00:22.040 --> 02:00:29.040]  i'm taking your phone call thanks for holding scott a.j. steve jeffrey kevin others let's
[02:00:29.040 --> 02:00:34.640]  go to scott in maryland right now you're on the air worldwide go ahead hey thanks alex
[02:00:34.640 --> 02:00:41.680]  i wanted to talk about car culture and how it's uniquely america yes go ahead hear me
[02:00:41.680 --> 02:00:48.400]  all right what's perfect is that it's who we are we're we're builders i still remember
[02:00:48.400 --> 02:00:53.360]  when i was a kid and i'd go out and help my dad be building old car out in the garage
[02:00:53.360 --> 02:01:00.000]  and we have these battery operated cars and you can only if you pull up the tesla site
[02:01:00.000 --> 02:01:03.960]  it's right there on their site where it's only on three major highways where you can
[02:01:03.960 --> 02:01:10.480]  charge your car so it comes back to your endgame idea of them trying to keep us within certain
[02:01:10.480 --> 02:01:16.480]  places and if they they know they've lost a gun control battle and so now they're trying
[02:01:16.480 --> 02:01:23.400]  to take our cars and keep us within one spot no you're right cars are uniquely americana
[02:01:23.400 --> 02:01:28.520]  it's about openness it's about the freedom and they demonize it is sprawl and they want
[02:01:28.520 --> 02:01:33.680]  to take it away even though electric cars use more energy hurt the environment more
[02:01:33.680 --> 02:01:38.000]  it's hard to distribute the power they don't care because it limits where you can go and
[02:01:38.000 --> 02:01:43.800]  what you can do and they want to remove humans from being able to take care of themselves
[02:01:43.800 --> 02:01:49.280]  from the land from being tinkerers from being engineers from knowing how to work or operate
[02:01:49.280 --> 02:01:53.800]  anything that's why they made the cars and things so so so impossible to work on that
[02:01:53.800 --> 02:01:58.000]  even shops can't work on them now you've got to quote go to the dealer and then suddenly
[02:01:58.000 --> 02:02:03.040]  the price you know it's three four five times what it was so yes everything is about controlled
[02:02:03.040 --> 02:02:08.280]  contained environments google's announcing they're going to build bubble cities they'll
[02:02:08.280 --> 02:02:13.880]  be given tax exemption where they're literally glass indomed building after building with
[02:02:13.880 --> 02:02:18.040]  a little bubble trolls only hang around in there and then you're only accepted into a
[02:02:18.040 --> 02:02:23.360]  google bubble if you're a leftist globalist so they're going to be all in their own little
[02:02:23.360 --> 02:02:27.080]  their their own little reservations their own little false realities and google already
[02:02:27.080 --> 02:02:33.880]  does that with its search results they admit it all and again with these ai drivers coming
[02:02:33.880 --> 02:02:38.280]  in now they're even taking the ability for you to drive away from so you can't even go
[02:02:38.280 --> 02:02:44.840]  or search or already with obama care computers filled with insurance company actuaries and
[02:02:44.840 --> 02:02:52.080]  bioethics board eugenics templates run by the literal thomas watson computers named
[02:02:52.080 --> 02:02:58.200]  after a top nazi decides what troops get health care who gets surgeries that's now coming
[02:02:58.200 --> 02:03:03.520]  in where the pediatricians everybody are just robots that follow up the computer tells them
[02:03:03.520 --> 02:03:08.760]  i mean it is just amazing we're already under ai control to a great extent we're already
[02:03:08.760 --> 02:03:15.880]  under computer automated command and control and it's just they're trying to take everything
[02:03:15.880 --> 02:03:21.400]  away from us and just dehumanize us even further with it they are the scum of the earth
[02:03:21.400 --> 02:03:27.000]  they are just absolute trash and they they say they are and people just have to totally
[02:03:27.000 --> 02:03:34.480]  break with the globalist totally break with their whole planned operas zeitgeist crap
[02:03:34.480 --> 02:03:38.560]  because it's not like what we're doing is perfect but we know that these are literal
[02:03:38.560 --> 02:03:44.960]  spiders that are trying to get us to tie ourselves up in webs and present our bellies to them
[02:03:44.960 --> 02:03:49.640]  so they can hiss around and hop around and and basically have power over us it's all
[02:03:49.640 --> 02:04:00.920]  about satanic fallen vampire like goblin creatures having their way over us without a doubt alex

[02:05:06.800 --> 02:05:11.280]  than 3000 that have never been seen by the public and more than 30 000 that have been
[02:05:11.280 --> 02:05:16.760]  released previously but with heavy redactions this means that thousands of formally classified
[02:05:16.760 --> 02:05:22.960]  documents related to kennedy's assassination will be unveiled jfk scholars cannot wait
[02:05:22.960 --> 02:05:27.400]  long time trump advisor roger stone was on the alex jones show this week he said he spoke
[02:05:27.400 --> 02:05:32.080]  directly to the president and urged him to release all the documents however stone notes
[02:05:32.080 --> 02:05:36.960]  that the president is under tremendous pressure by the central intelligence agency to delay
[02:05:36.960 --> 02:05:42.160]  the release of the documents for another 25 years stone said the issue is now transparency
[02:05:42.160 --> 02:05:47.280]  what is the government hiding at this point he believes the documents will show that jfk
[02:05:47.280 --> 02:05:53.720]  assassin lee harvey oswald was trained nurtured and put in place by the cia neon mackadoo

[02:07:16.000 --> 02:07:22.160]  force so they the social engineers want to tell you that you are with the outside force
[02:07:22.160 --> 02:07:29.640]  to turn you into the enemy it's really amazingly simple but it applied enough and and and pushed
[02:07:29.640 --> 02:07:35.360]  enough and bullied enough they think you're going to finally roll over to them but hen
[02:07:35.360 --> 02:07:40.720]  pecking only works if you're half awake or asleep it doesn't work when you're aware of

[02:09:21.560 --> 02:09:29.320]  eternal resistance to every form of tyranny over the mind of man to quote thomas jefferson
[02:09:29.320 --> 02:09:37.680]  i mean can you imagine taking communion with the globalist could you imagine being anti-human
[02:09:37.680 --> 02:09:42.600]  and wanting to screw people over and getting off on the fact that you know the fluoride
[02:09:42.600 --> 02:09:48.960]  and the vaccines lower iq's together by 30 points and you look at how you've devastated
[02:09:48.960 --> 02:09:53.840]  the public and you find out leftist controllers all filter their water and never take vaccines
[02:09:53.840 --> 02:10:03.360]  look into it and you just sit back and it is just mind blowing that they love walking
[02:10:03.360 --> 02:10:09.480]  around and seeing how hurt you are they get they it's their power they're going to brain

[02:10:16.920 --> 02:10:24.680]  not trash and of course they howl back we've already killed hundreds of millions we've
[02:10:24.680 --> 02:10:29.440]  already are diseased many more and we're putting cancer viruses in and look how many we already
[02:10:29.440 --> 02:10:35.320]  got oh i know you already got a lot of people but your time's running out so you sit there
[02:10:35.320 --> 02:10:40.040]  and you you punch over and hoard all the brain dead people you got all the victims and you
[02:10:40.040 --> 02:10:47.560]  just sit there and you enjoy them while you're eating them spiritually but know this you
[02:10:47.560 --> 02:10:55.080]  are going to go in that wood chipper you are going to go you're going to go into the hell

[02:11:11.800 --> 02:11:20.640]  from god that's hell separate no need to add the fire you are literal gates of hell trying
[02:11:20.640 --> 02:11:23.800]  to destroy everything i mean that's who they are and i know i harp on this more and more
[02:11:23.800 --> 02:11:30.520]  it's just it's my own it's my own understanding it's not just the top globalists that want
[02:11:30.520 --> 02:11:38.160]  to kill everybody just because they're so satanic and so evil the average minion now
[02:11:38.160 --> 02:11:43.240]  through the screen time through the brainwashing you're either getting more awake or more into

[02:21:54.400 --> 02:21:56.400]  With straight faces are saying this
[02:21:56.400 --> 02:21:58.400]  That sounds insane
[02:21:58.400 --> 02:22:00.400]  That sounds like a cult
[02:22:00.400 --> 02:22:02.400]  That's what it is
[02:22:02.400 --> 02:22:04.400]  Where you dress and talk like they say
[02:22:04.400 --> 02:22:06.400]  Of middle patients that are used and controlled
[02:22:06.400 --> 02:22:08.400]  And statistically are very poor
[02:22:08.400 --> 02:22:10.400]  And statistically very depressed
[02:22:10.400 --> 02:22:12.400]  And Facebook documents show they try to artificially keep you depressed
[02:22:12.400 --> 02:22:14.400]  So they can control you
[02:22:14.400 --> 02:22:16.400]  I'm going to go to AJ and Steve and Jeffrey
[02:22:16.400 --> 02:22:18.400]  And Kevin have been holding patiently here in a moment
[02:22:18.400 --> 02:22:20.400]  But first
[02:22:20.400 --> 02:22:22.400]  Here is a literal video
[02:22:22.400 --> 02:22:24.400]  Since Halloween is almost here
[02:22:24.400 --> 02:22:26.400]  Samhain
[02:22:26.400 --> 02:22:28.400]  All saint today
[02:22:28.400 --> 02:22:30.400]  Guess you got Day of the Dead as well
[02:22:30.400 --> 02:22:32.400]  Got in Mexico
[02:22:32.400 --> 02:22:34.400]  And the point is it's a fall festival
[02:22:34.400 --> 02:22:36.400]  And so here is a literal goblin
[02:22:36.400 --> 02:22:38.400]  Videotaped by
[02:22:38.400 --> 02:22:40.400]  Michael Zimmerman
[02:22:40.400 --> 02:22:42.400]  That attacked me
[02:22:42.400 --> 02:22:44.400]  Because I attempted to speak to it when I was screaming FU
[02:22:44.400 --> 02:22:46.400]  This is a goblin that attacked me
[02:22:46.400 --> 02:22:48.400]  These are real gibbering noises
[02:22:48.400 --> 02:22:50.400]  Listen
[02:22:50.400 --> 02:22:52.400]  Hey, come tell me on camera
[02:22:52.400 --> 02:22:54.400]  Come tell me on camera
[02:22:54.400 --> 02:22:56.400]  I'm your talent
[02:22:56.400 --> 02:22:58.400]  I'm your talent
[02:22:58.400 --> 02:23:00.400]  I'm your own camera
[02:23:00.400 --> 02:23:02.400]  I'm actually who you are
[02:23:02.400 --> 02:23:04.400]  Go ahead, yeah
[02:23:08.400 --> 02:23:10.400]  Yeah, I'm your mama
[02:23:10.400 --> 02:23:12.400]  I'm your mama
[02:23:12.400 --> 02:23:14.400]  Target is the mother piece
[02:23:14.400 --> 02:23:16.400]  I want
[02:23:16.400 --> 02:23:18.400]  I want
[02:23:18.400 --> 02:23:20.400]  Species
[02:23:20.400 --> 02:23:22.400]  Target is your mother
[02:23:22.400 --> 02:23:24.400]  This is it, right here
[02:23:24.400 --> 02:23:26.400]  Goblin is angry
[02:23:26.400 --> 02:23:28.400]  I can't even talk
[02:23:28.400 --> 02:23:30.400]  He thought it was bad breath again
[02:23:34.400 --> 02:23:36.400]  A literal slave of the system
[02:23:36.400 --> 02:23:38.400]  See that?
[02:23:38.400 --> 02:23:40.400]  Look at this slave
[02:23:48.400 --> 02:23:50.400]  Alright, back to your phone calls
[02:23:52.400 --> 02:23:54.400]  Let's talk to AJ in Ohio
[02:23:54.400 --> 02:23:56.400]  Thanks for holding AJ here on the air
[02:23:56.400 --> 02:23:58.400]  Hey, what's going on, Alex?
[02:23:58.400 --> 02:24:00.400]  Good, brother. Thanks for calling
[02:24:00.400 --> 02:24:02.400]  Hey, not a prompt, thanks for thanking that call
[02:24:02.400 --> 02:24:04.400]  Now, you know, we can't say goblin anymore
[02:24:04.400 --> 02:24:06.400]  Because that's this week's racial slur
[02:24:06.400 --> 02:24:08.400]  That we're not allowed to say anymore
[02:24:08.400 --> 02:24:10.400]  They'll probably start saying we're not supposed to use it
[02:24:10.400 --> 02:24:12.400]  But, you know, again, they're trying to territorialize
[02:24:12.400 --> 02:24:14.400]  All information saying it's racist
[02:24:14.400 --> 02:24:16.400]  So you can only use information that they approve
[02:24:16.400 --> 02:24:20.400]  I mean, this is a dysfunctional group of mental patients
[02:24:20.400 --> 02:24:22.400]  They were supposed to put their dysfunction into us
[02:24:22.400 --> 02:24:24.400]  To bring us all down
[02:24:24.400 --> 02:24:26.400]  They contained it on the universities
[02:24:26.400 --> 02:24:28.400]  And in the corporations, and that's why they're all failing
[02:24:28.400 --> 02:24:30.400]  Isn't it beautiful?
[02:24:30.400 --> 02:24:32.400]  Oh, yeah, definitely. I'm telling you right now
[02:24:32.400 --> 02:24:34.400]  I'm a truck driver for my occupation
[02:24:34.400 --> 02:24:36.400]  And the biggest fear I had
[02:24:36.400 --> 02:24:38.400]  Coming out of this election was, yeah, people are awake
[02:24:38.400 --> 02:24:40.400]  For the election, but
[02:24:40.400 --> 02:24:42.400]  My biggest fear was people were going to go back to their safe zones
[02:24:42.400 --> 02:24:44.400]  And realize, okay, we won this one
[02:24:44.400 --> 02:24:46.400]  Let's take a breath, and you can't take a breath
[02:24:46.400 --> 02:24:48.400]  When you're dealing with these type of people
[02:24:48.400 --> 02:24:50.400]  You gotta stay on them
[02:24:50.400 --> 02:24:52.400]  And I tell you what, just from all the people that I've
[02:24:52.400 --> 02:24:54.400]  Make deliveries to on a daily basis
[02:24:54.400 --> 02:24:56.400]  I talk to them, they're awake
[02:24:56.400 --> 02:24:58.400]  And once you open that can of worms
[02:24:58.400 --> 02:25:00.400]  That's no going back
[02:25:00.400 --> 02:25:02.400]  And by the way, when you always demand delivery
[02:25:02.400 --> 02:25:04.400]  From a person driving a truck
[02:25:04.400 --> 02:25:06.400]  Then you're going to keep people out there
[02:25:06.400 --> 02:25:08.400]  And people need to know how to drive a truck
[02:25:08.400 --> 02:25:10.400]  Or need to not just have a calculator
[02:25:10.400 --> 02:25:12.400]  It's dehumanizing us
[02:25:12.400 --> 02:25:14.400]  We need, not because computers are bad
[02:25:14.400 --> 02:25:16.400]  The globalists are designing it
[02:25:16.400 --> 02:25:18.400]  To displace us so governments
[02:25:18.400 --> 02:25:20.400]  Can dictate our surrender
[02:25:20.400 --> 02:25:22.400]  Must continue to support real farmers
[02:25:22.400 --> 02:25:24.400]  And support real truck drivers
[02:25:24.400 --> 02:25:26.400]  And real soldiers
[02:25:26.400 --> 02:25:28.400]  Because this automation will be the undoing of us
[02:25:28.400 --> 02:25:30.400]  That is correct
[02:25:30.400 --> 02:25:32.400]  And definitely when I saw your ad
[02:25:32.400 --> 02:25:34.400]  With that bot
[02:25:34.400 --> 02:25:36.400]  I think it was yesterday, you guys were talking about it
[02:25:36.400 --> 02:25:38.400]  The crazy
[02:25:38.400 --> 02:25:40.400]  Dubai robot or whatever that's going on
[02:25:40.400 --> 02:25:42.400]  Mixed that with
[02:25:42.400 --> 02:25:44.400]  Now I guess over in Germany, Mercedes Benz
[02:25:44.400 --> 02:25:46.400]  Was coming out with an all purpose
[02:25:46.400 --> 02:25:48.400]  Semi-truck, and I'm like, you're still going to be somebody
[02:25:48.400 --> 02:25:50.400]  Back in, you know what I mean
[02:25:50.400 --> 02:25:52.400]  You're still going to have somebody have to unload it
[02:25:52.400 --> 02:25:54.400]  And it just cracks me up that they think
[02:25:54.400 --> 02:25:56.400]  That they can push this narrative
[02:25:56.400 --> 02:25:58.400]  And basically cut out all the good paying jobs
[02:25:58.400 --> 02:26:00.400]  For the middle class
[02:26:00.400 --> 02:26:02.400]  And you're going to have somebody that goes and services it
[02:26:02.400 --> 02:26:04.400]  When it breaks down
[02:26:04.400 --> 02:26:06.400]  And again, and it's not that
[02:26:06.400 --> 02:26:08.400]  Computers or progress
[02:26:08.400 --> 02:26:10.400]  Or bad, the globalists admit
[02:26:10.400 --> 02:26:12.400]  They're building a world not for humans
[02:26:12.400 --> 02:26:14.400]  Why the future doesn't need us
[02:26:14.400 --> 02:26:16.400]  We need to say we're going to
[02:26:16.400 --> 02:26:18.400]  We're a bunch of delusional thinking
[02:26:18.400 --> 02:26:20.400]  They're god
[02:26:20.400 --> 02:26:22.400]  Tech giants don't make us
[02:26:22.400 --> 02:26:24.400]  Obsolete, we're going to make them obsolete
[02:26:24.400 --> 02:26:26.400]  They've declared war on us
[02:26:26.400 --> 02:26:28.400]  They're using computers and robots to do it
[02:26:28.400 --> 02:26:30.400]  Let's take control of the machines
[02:26:30.400 --> 02:26:32.400]  And the technology and use it against them
[02:26:32.400 --> 02:26:34.400]  Just like the internet and we're going to win
[02:26:34.400 --> 02:26:36.400]  If we're conscious of it, then make decisions
[02:26:36.400 --> 02:26:38.400]  Every day, financially and in other ways
[02:26:38.400 --> 02:26:40.400]  That support human liberty, we are unstoppable
[02:26:40.400 --> 02:26:42.400]  If we launch operations now
[02:26:42.400 --> 02:26:44.400]  Exactly
[02:26:44.400 --> 02:26:46.400]  The last thing I wanted to leave with Alex
[02:26:46.400 --> 02:26:48.400]  I wanted to thank you for taking the blinders off
[02:26:48.400 --> 02:26:50.400]  Me, so to speak
[02:26:50.400 --> 02:26:52.400]  Coming out of the military
[02:26:52.400 --> 02:26:54.400]  Your peers Morgan debate that you're very famous for
[02:26:54.400 --> 02:26:56.400]  That was kind of what woke me up
[02:26:56.400 --> 02:26:58.400]  I'm like, wow, this guy, I finally got an advocate
[02:26:58.400 --> 02:27:00.400]  That can speak for me, that has the platform
[02:27:00.400 --> 02:27:02.400]  To speak for me
[02:27:02.400 --> 02:27:04.400]  So you guys keep up the great work, brother
[02:27:04.400 --> 02:27:06.400]  And you guys have a good one
[02:27:06.400 --> 02:27:08.400]  God bless you, let me say you speak well for yourself
[02:27:08.400 --> 02:27:10.400]  And that's why all the humble men like yourself
[02:27:10.400 --> 02:27:12.400]  Need to start a YouTube channel or a Facebook channel
[02:27:12.400 --> 02:27:14.400]  To make that sense for us all
[02:27:14.400 --> 02:27:16.400]  And just put out the info in your common sense
[02:27:16.400 --> 02:27:18.400]  Don't count on me, make me obsolete
[02:27:18.400 --> 02:27:20.400]  Let me tell you how you make Alex Jones obsolete
[02:27:20.400 --> 02:27:22.400]  All of you start radio shows
[02:27:22.400 --> 02:27:24.400]  Start YouTube, start
[02:27:24.400 --> 02:27:26.400]  Blog talk, radio, whatever
[02:27:26.400 --> 02:27:28.400]  Start local access, start a local newspaper
[02:27:28.400 --> 02:27:30.400]  Call in to C-SPAN, whatever you do
[02:27:30.400 --> 02:27:32.400]  Everybody starts communicating
[02:27:32.400 --> 02:27:34.400]  Like you just did
[02:27:34.400 --> 02:27:36.400]  We are unstoppable
[02:27:36.400 --> 02:27:38.400]  Let's jam in one more call here
[02:27:38.400 --> 02:27:40.400]  Stephen Montana, you're on the air
[02:27:40.400 --> 02:27:42.400]  This is a deplorable Stephen Montana
[02:27:42.400 --> 02:27:44.400]  And I wanted to let you know, Alex
[02:27:44.400 --> 02:27:46.400]  Thank you, and I'll make it quick
[02:27:46.400 --> 02:27:48.400]  You don't have to respond
[02:27:48.400 --> 02:27:50.400]  But Americans are getting mad as hell
[02:27:50.400 --> 02:27:52.400]  And I talk to people and the best way
[02:27:52.400 --> 02:27:54.400]  Of communications is communicating
[02:27:54.400 --> 02:27:56.400]  And that's one-on-one
[02:27:56.400 --> 02:27:58.400]  I was talking to a guy yesterday, same way
[02:27:58.400 --> 02:28:00.400]  And Americans aren't going to take it anymore
[02:28:00.400 --> 02:28:02.400]  And the biggest thing I'm hearing
[02:28:02.400 --> 02:28:04.400]  Is the crooks need to go to jail
[02:28:04.400 --> 02:28:06.400]  And basically, yes
[02:28:06.400 --> 02:28:08.400]  The Kennedy file should be released now
[02:28:08.400 --> 02:28:10.400]  To protect Trump
[02:28:10.400 --> 02:28:12.400]  Because if he gets into those
[02:28:12.400 --> 02:28:14.400]  They're protecting themselves and trying to keep their job
[02:28:14.400 --> 02:28:16.400]  They need to be unemployed
[02:28:16.400 --> 02:28:18.400]  You know what he's doing to the deep state
[02:28:18.400 --> 02:28:20.400]  He knows what's in there, it's the bushes
[02:28:20.400 --> 02:28:22.400]  It's all of them in there, and these are real files
[02:28:22.400 --> 02:28:24.400]  That's why they're so scared
[02:28:24.400 --> 02:28:26.400]  And I think he's probably using this the next 60 days
[02:28:26.400 --> 02:28:28.400]  To broker some deals with the deep state behind the scenes
[02:28:28.400 --> 02:28:30.400]  But I think they'll stab him in the back
[02:28:30.400 --> 02:28:32.400]  And kill him
[02:28:32.400 --> 02:28:34.400]  Let me tell you, this is full-on
[02:28:34.400 --> 02:28:36.400]  Globalist warfare right now
[02:28:36.400 --> 02:28:38.400]  Couldn't be a crazier time
[02:28:38.400 --> 02:28:40.400]  Stay there, Steve, I went to you later
[02:28:40.400 --> 02:28:42.400]  We need to come back and finish up then
[02:28:42.400 --> 02:28:44.400]  Jeffrey, Kevin, and others
[02:28:44.400 --> 02:28:46.400]  And then I got a bunch of news I haven't hit yet
[02:28:46.400 --> 02:28:48.400]  I'm Alex Jones at newswars.com

[02:30:26.400 --> 02:30:28.400]  Instead of containing fluoride

[02:31:56.400 --> 02:31:58.400]  Not a group you developed living defense for us
[02:31:58.400 --> 02:32:00.400]  It took you over a year to do it
[02:32:00.400 --> 02:32:01.400]  Why is this so good?
[02:32:01.400 --> 02:32:04.400]  Because people are actually waking up to the problem
[02:32:04.400 --> 02:32:06.400]  That pretty much scares me the most
[02:32:06.400 --> 02:32:09.400]  I mean, I try to make sure that I don't put
[02:32:09.400 --> 02:32:12.400]  Topps in some food and water and beverages in my system
[02:32:12.400 --> 02:32:15.400]  Right now we're dealing with massive parasites
[02:32:15.400 --> 02:32:18.400]  Which is anything that's harmful to your body
[02:32:18.400 --> 02:32:20.400]  That lives off a host mechanism
[02:32:20.400 --> 02:32:22.400]  Right now with all the refugees
[02:32:22.400 --> 02:32:24.400]  Spreading disease around
[02:32:24.400 --> 02:32:26.400]  We have biological warfare going on everywhere
[02:32:26.400 --> 02:32:27.400]  These are all parasites
[02:32:27.400 --> 02:32:29.400]  Tell us about all the stuff I said
[02:32:29.400 --> 02:32:30.400]  There's so many things that are in it
[02:32:30.400 --> 02:32:31.400]  You have the neem in there
[02:32:31.400 --> 02:32:33.400]  You have the organic clove bud
[02:32:33.400 --> 02:32:34.400]  The organic wormwood
[02:32:34.400 --> 02:32:36.400]  I recommend doing a parasite cleanse
[02:32:36.400 --> 02:32:37.400]  At least twice a year
[02:32:37.400 --> 02:32:39.400]  Alright, well I'm glad we've got some back in
[02:32:39.400 --> 02:32:41.400]  Because I'm going back on it today
[02:32:41.400 --> 02:32:42.400]  I just came back in yesterday
[02:32:42.400 --> 02:32:44.400]  Living Defense, infowarslife.com
[02:32:44.400 --> 02:32:45.400]  And folks, you can't lose
[02:32:45.400 --> 02:32:47.400]  It's full of stuff that's great for your body, period
[02:32:47.400 --> 02:32:49.400]  And you support the broadcast
[02:32:49.400 --> 02:32:51.400]  infowarslife.com
[02:32:51.400 --> 02:32:53.400]  Thank you, Dr. Group, from the Global Healing Center
[02:32:53.400 --> 02:33:14.400]  Thank you so much for all your work, sir, on this great product
[02:33:14.400 --> 02:33:24.400]  You are listening to an infowars.com frontline report
[02:33:24.400 --> 02:33:30.400]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance
[02:33:30.400 --> 02:33:34.400]  We're back live, going right back to your phone calls
[02:33:34.400 --> 02:33:37.400]  Stephen Montana, Jeffrey, Kevin, Jason, Alex, John
[02:33:37.400 --> 02:33:40.400]  We're going to go to all of you
[02:33:40.400 --> 02:33:44.400]  But every day I see five, six, seven, eight news articles
[02:33:44.400 --> 02:33:46.400]  Reporting with straight faces
[02:33:46.400 --> 02:33:51.400]  That Yale looks to stop teaching the classics in English
[02:33:51.400 --> 02:33:54.400]  Because, well, the classics are races
[02:33:54.400 --> 02:33:57.400]  Shakespeare, you name it
[02:33:57.400 --> 02:34:00.400]  Or mathematics is racist
[02:34:00.400 --> 02:34:03.400]  It needs to not be taught
[02:34:03.400 --> 02:34:06.400]  I mean, they're politicizing everything
[02:34:06.400 --> 02:34:09.400]  It's completely insane by design
[02:34:09.400 --> 02:34:12.400]  And now any old statues are being attacked
[02:34:12.400 --> 02:34:15.400]  Teddy Roosevelt attacked at Museum of Natural History
[02:34:15.400 --> 02:34:17.400]  People saying he's a racist, take him down
[02:34:17.400 --> 02:34:19.400]  They don't even know who they're going after
[02:34:19.400 --> 02:34:21.400]  And here is the chronicle
[02:34:21.400 --> 02:34:24.400]  This is owned by the folks that own South by Southwest
[02:34:24.400 --> 02:34:26.400]  That giant nerd fest where they try to lure in
[02:34:26.400 --> 02:34:29.400]  All the little desperate nobodies and trendies
[02:34:29.400 --> 02:34:31.400]  Hope they're going to get a job
[02:34:31.400 --> 02:34:33.400]  Or become successful somehow
[02:34:33.400 --> 02:34:35.400]  With the big tech giants and the rest of it
[02:34:35.400 --> 02:34:38.400]  And Hollywood and its invasion of Texas
[02:34:38.400 --> 02:34:41.400]  But they have a Halloween mask that's the cover
[02:34:41.400 --> 02:34:44.400]  Armed white male
[02:34:44.400 --> 02:34:46.400]  And he's pointing a rifle at you
[02:34:46.400 --> 02:34:49.400]  That has two scopes
[02:34:49.400 --> 02:34:53.400]  Talk about the ignorant weirdo
[02:34:53.400 --> 02:34:55.400]  That doesn't know anything about guns
[02:34:55.400 --> 02:34:57.400]  I guess they think it's like a telescope
[02:34:57.400 --> 02:34:58.400]  We've got a spotting scope
[02:34:58.400 --> 02:35:01.400]  And then the telescope itself, that's not on guns
[02:35:01.400 --> 02:35:03.400]  That's on telescopes
[02:35:03.400 --> 02:35:05.400]  So just the total ignorance
[02:35:05.400 --> 02:35:08.400]  It's a white man with blonde hair
[02:35:08.400 --> 02:35:11.400]  And an evil blue eye
[02:35:11.400 --> 02:35:13.400]  And you see this in Hollywood and the culture
[02:35:13.400 --> 02:35:16.400]  And then you've got everybody saying Russian scum
[02:35:16.400 --> 02:35:18.400]  The Russians as a people are evil
[02:35:18.400 --> 02:35:19.400]  They control our election
[02:35:19.400 --> 02:35:22.400]  Meanwhile it's Russia paying off Hillary
[02:35:22.400 --> 02:35:25.400]  And they're just so proud of the provocativeness
[02:35:25.400 --> 02:35:30.400]  Of trying to incite
[02:35:30.400 --> 02:35:34.400]  Minority groups into their anti-white race cult
[02:35:34.400 --> 02:35:37.400]  It's being directed by a bunch of old hunchback liberals
[02:35:37.400 --> 02:35:39.400]  Like the guy, he's got a fake name
[02:35:39.400 --> 02:35:41.400]  Lewis Black, forget his real name
[02:35:41.400 --> 02:35:43.400]  That owns the Chronicle
[02:35:43.400 --> 02:35:45.400]  I mean it's just an assault
[02:35:45.400 --> 02:35:46.400]  And it's everywhere
[02:35:46.400 --> 02:35:50.400]  We're just waiting in it
[02:35:50.400 --> 02:35:53.400]  We're just waiting in all of it
[02:35:53.400 --> 02:35:54.400]  Here's the thing
[02:35:54.400 --> 02:35:56.400]  They may have their big nerd fest
[02:35:56.400 --> 02:35:58.400]  South by Southwest
[02:35:58.400 --> 02:36:00.400]  That is somewhat successful
[02:36:00.400 --> 02:36:02.400]  Though they say it's becoming more unpopular
[02:36:02.400 --> 02:36:04.400]  It's just disintegrating
[02:36:04.400 --> 02:36:07.400]  The Chronicle itself is a joke that nobody reads
[02:36:07.400 --> 02:36:08.400]  And of course it's Lewis Black
[02:36:08.400 --> 02:36:09.400]  Guys for years
[02:36:09.400 --> 02:36:10.400]  Been writing lies about me
[02:36:10.400 --> 02:36:12.400]  And always trying to get me off the air
[02:36:12.400 --> 02:36:13.400]  How I'm dangerous
[02:36:13.400 --> 02:36:15.400]  I mean give me a break man
[02:36:15.400 --> 02:36:18.400]  You talk about a weevil
[02:36:18.400 --> 02:36:19.400]  You talk about everything
[02:36:19.400 --> 02:36:24.400]  We talk about what's wrong with this country
[02:36:24.400 --> 02:36:26.400]  I just love watching Hollywood and the NFL
[02:36:26.400 --> 02:36:29.400]  And all these people just sink into the mud
[02:36:29.400 --> 02:36:32.400]  Just look at that race baiting
[02:36:32.400 --> 02:36:34.400]  Armed white male
[02:36:34.400 --> 02:36:36.400]  You're an effing white male
[02:36:36.400 --> 02:36:41.400]  Says Age Screlics
[02:36:41.400 --> 02:36:42.400]  So when you spread our links
[02:36:42.400 --> 02:36:43.400]  You spread our articles
[02:36:43.400 --> 02:36:45.400]  When you buy our products
[02:36:45.400 --> 02:36:47.400]  It is an act of resistance to these people
[02:36:47.400 --> 02:36:49.400]  And I know you're not sneaking to their level
[02:36:49.400 --> 02:36:51.400]  So our audience is incredibly diverse
[02:36:51.400 --> 02:36:55.400]  This is meant to divide this country along racial lines
[02:36:55.400 --> 02:36:56.400]  They know Christians
[02:36:56.400 --> 02:36:57.400]  And they know conservatives
[02:36:57.400 --> 02:37:01.400]  And they know people fought hard in the west in slavery
[02:37:01.400 --> 02:37:03.400]  They hope the public doesn't read history
[02:37:03.400 --> 02:37:05.400]  So they can find out that the west
[02:37:05.400 --> 02:37:08.400]  Actually made the first moves to abolish slavery
[02:37:08.400 --> 02:37:10.400]  And to empower women
[02:37:10.400 --> 02:37:13.400]  They're bringing in a new form of corporate oppression
[02:37:13.400 --> 02:37:15.400]  And they want to attack all that's old
[02:37:15.400 --> 02:37:17.400]  Because what's old was the Renaissance
[02:37:17.400 --> 02:37:19.400]  Trying to be pure
[02:37:19.400 --> 02:37:21.400]  Trying to not be barbarous
[02:37:21.400 --> 02:37:22.400]  Trying to be good
[02:37:22.400 --> 02:37:24.400]  Trying to grow a middle class
[02:37:24.400 --> 02:37:26.400]  Now it grew such successful empires
[02:37:26.400 --> 02:37:28.400]  That they ended up taking over the world
[02:37:28.400 --> 02:37:30.400]  But just because it empowered more people
[02:37:30.400 --> 02:37:31.400]  Than any other group
[02:37:31.400 --> 02:37:32.400]  Didn't mean we were perfect
[02:37:32.400 --> 02:37:34.400]  Didn't mean we didn't have big problems
[02:37:34.400 --> 02:37:36.400]  But the experiment worked so well
[02:37:36.400 --> 02:37:38.400]  It displaced the other tyrannies
[02:37:38.400 --> 02:37:40.400]  And it was a lesser tyranny
[02:37:40.400 --> 02:37:42.400]  Now evil corporate control groups
[02:37:42.400 --> 02:37:44.400]  Have gained control of the west
[02:37:44.400 --> 02:37:46.400]  And have used to dominate the world
[02:37:48.400 --> 02:37:50.400]  And then they turn around now
[02:37:50.400 --> 02:37:52.400]  To inflict the race-based cult
[02:37:52.400 --> 02:37:55.400]  Now that the country is more than half non-white
[02:37:55.400 --> 02:37:57.400]  And it's going to accelerate
[02:37:57.400 --> 02:37:58.400]  They want to flip the script
[02:37:58.400 --> 02:37:59.400]  Just like the Democrats always do
[02:37:59.400 --> 02:38:00.400]  And have race-based systems
[02:38:00.400 --> 02:38:03.400]  And remember, they know what they're doing
[02:38:05.400 --> 02:38:07.400]  They know what they're invoking
[02:38:07.400 --> 02:38:09.400]  And the good news is, they're failing
[02:38:09.400 --> 02:38:11.400]  Lewis Black is a failure
[02:38:11.400 --> 02:38:13.400]  And all of his other cohorts
[02:38:13.400 --> 02:38:15.400]  Like Stephen Colbert, you know
[02:38:15.400 --> 02:38:17.400]  With the whole Russiagate thing
[02:38:17.400 --> 02:38:19.400]  You've been proven to be the fraud
[02:38:19.400 --> 02:38:20.400]  You're the joke
[02:38:20.400 --> 02:38:21.400]  You're the political bankrupt group
[02:38:21.400 --> 02:38:23.400]  That claimed it controlled America's culture
[02:38:23.400 --> 02:38:25.400]  We just ignored you
[02:38:25.400 --> 02:38:27.400]  Now you've taken over academia
[02:38:27.400 --> 02:38:28.400]  And everything else
[02:38:28.400 --> 02:38:30.400]  And you're showing us, hey, I'm the boss
[02:38:30.400 --> 02:38:32.400]  I'm going to run your life
[02:38:32.400 --> 02:38:34.400]  People are actually like, really?
[02:38:34.400 --> 02:38:35.400]  Get off my back
[02:38:35.400 --> 02:38:37.400]  We tolerated you, you're intolerant
[02:38:37.400 --> 02:38:39.400]  We're done with you
[02:38:41.400 --> 02:38:42.400]  It's amazing
[02:38:42.400 --> 02:38:44.400]  And they're out to destroy us, ladies and gentlemen
[02:38:45.400 --> 02:38:47.400]  I've had law firms look at it
[02:38:47.400 --> 02:38:49.400]  I'm not ready to talk about it yet
[02:38:49.400 --> 02:38:53.400]  But I have hired the top law firm in the country
[02:38:53.400 --> 02:38:55.400]  That's been successful more than any other group
[02:38:55.400 --> 02:38:58.400]  And we did soon notice the letters today
[02:38:58.400 --> 02:39:00.400]  About what you've seen in the news
[02:39:00.400 --> 02:39:02.400]  Trying to destroy them for us
[02:39:02.400 --> 02:39:05.400]  And accompany with defamation, slander, libel
[02:39:05.400 --> 02:39:08.400]  And it's a very strong case
[02:39:08.400 --> 02:39:11.400]  And I need your support
[02:39:11.400 --> 02:39:14.400]  And I've told everybody, I've been warning all these people
[02:39:14.400 --> 02:39:17.400]  I'm very close to filing suit on Tom Brokaw
[02:39:17.400 --> 02:39:19.400]  He has not reversed himself and others
[02:39:22.400 --> 02:39:23.400]  I'm not a litigious person
[02:39:23.400 --> 02:39:25.400]  But I've got to strike back against these people
[02:39:25.400 --> 02:39:27.400]  Because if they can bully me out of existence
[02:39:27.400 --> 02:39:29.400]  They can bully you out of existence
[02:39:29.400 --> 02:39:31.400]  But all you've got to do is decide to go to
[02:39:31.400 --> 02:39:33.400]  M4warstore.com
[02:39:33.400 --> 02:39:35.400]  And to buy the products that are great
[02:39:35.400 --> 02:39:37.400]  High quality, water filtration, supplements
[02:39:37.400 --> 02:39:39.400]  The new Antifa t-shirt we've got
[02:39:39.400 --> 02:39:41.400]  That looks like the Antifa t-shirt
[02:39:41.400 --> 02:39:43.400]  But says anti-fascist, anti-communist
[02:39:43.400 --> 02:39:45.400]  M4warstore.com with a gas and flag
[02:39:45.400 --> 02:39:47.400]  It's beautiful
[02:39:47.400 --> 02:39:49.400]  We're selling it, ladies and gentlemen
[02:39:49.400 --> 02:39:51.400]  For $13
[02:39:51.400 --> 02:39:53.400]  $13.95
[02:39:55.400 --> 02:39:57.400]  Okay
[02:39:57.400 --> 02:39:59.400]  I mean, I want to sell these
[02:39:59.400 --> 02:40:01.400]  I should be selling them for $100
[02:40:01.400 --> 02:40:03.400]  But then we get under operation, I know you'd buy them
[02:40:03.400 --> 02:40:05.400]  But I like to sell some very, very low price
[02:40:05.400 --> 02:40:07.400]  A matching sticker
[02:40:07.400 --> 02:40:09.400]  We're going to add some of the other M4war stickers
[02:40:09.400 --> 02:40:11.400]  And let's just all get more aggressive
[02:40:11.400 --> 02:40:13.400]  In the M4war, we're winning
[02:40:13.400 --> 02:40:15.400]  So it's at M4warstore.com
[02:40:15.400 --> 02:40:17.400]  Okay, I said I'd go to your calls and I'm not
[02:40:17.400 --> 02:40:19.400]  I'm a bad person. Stephen Montana, you're making some great points
[02:40:19.400 --> 02:40:21.400]  Go ahead and finish up
[02:40:21.400 --> 02:40:23.400]  What I also want to say is
[02:40:23.400 --> 02:40:25.400]  We got your back, Alex
[02:40:25.400 --> 02:40:27.400]  Your listeners have your back
[02:40:27.400 --> 02:40:29.400]  Don't worry about it
[02:40:31.400 --> 02:40:33.400]  Getting back to what I wanted to call originally
[02:40:33.400 --> 02:40:35.400]  Was Roger and you were talking about
[02:40:35.400 --> 02:40:37.400]  How, I believe as a McMasters
[02:40:37.400 --> 02:40:39.400]  Was talking about sending 50,000 troops to Afghanistan
[02:40:39.400 --> 02:40:41.400]  That's a total exclusive
[02:40:41.400 --> 02:40:43.400]  That's directly
[02:40:43.400 --> 02:40:45.400]  Well, you got to ask yourself why
[02:40:45.400 --> 02:40:47.400]  And it hit me when I was looking at my view
[02:40:47.400 --> 02:40:49.400]  Out in Montana window
[02:40:49.400 --> 02:40:51.400]  That they want to get our troops out of the country
[02:40:51.400 --> 02:40:53.400]  For, let's say, November 4th
[02:40:53.400 --> 02:40:55.400]  That our American troops wouldn't be here
[02:40:55.400 --> 02:40:57.400]  And the soldiers who stand behind us
[02:40:57.400 --> 02:40:59.400]  And who abide by the Constitution
[02:40:59.400 --> 02:41:01.400]  And they want to put them out of the country
[02:41:01.400 --> 02:41:03.400]  That's 40,000 of the best
[02:41:03.400 --> 02:41:05.400]  Trump supporters
[02:41:05.400 --> 02:41:07.400]  Being put into that meat grinder
[02:41:07.400 --> 02:41:09.400]  You know, and there's no reason for it
[02:41:09.400 --> 02:41:11.400]  And Trump pulled the right thing on it
[02:41:11.400 --> 02:41:13.400]  And I had to bring that up
[02:41:13.400 --> 02:41:15.400]  Because there's no way that you would send out
[02:41:15.400 --> 02:41:17.400]  That kind of troops
[02:41:17.400 --> 02:41:19.400]  Unless you had a major reason
[02:41:19.400 --> 02:41:21.400]  Especially we know we've already lost that
[02:41:21.400 --> 02:41:23.400]  We won't have any one war
[02:41:23.400 --> 02:41:25.400]  You can't win when there's not a civilization
[02:41:25.400 --> 02:41:27.400]  No, I tell you, the Afghans are weird, man
[02:41:27.400 --> 02:41:29.400]  Did you know they have the highest per capita
[02:41:29.400 --> 02:41:31.400]  Of trannies? And I'm not not
[02:41:31.400 --> 02:41:33.400]  People want to, they make these young men
[02:41:33.400 --> 02:41:35.400]  That aren't masculine be women
[02:41:35.400 --> 02:41:37.400]  And then they have sex with them
[02:41:37.400 --> 02:41:39.400]  The brothels up in the hills
[02:41:39.400 --> 02:41:41.400]  Where it's men you have sex with
[02:41:41.400 --> 02:41:43.400]  Man, let me tell you, there's some weirdos
[02:41:43.400 --> 02:41:46.400]  And I mean, they're like murdering, killing
[02:41:46.400 --> 02:41:49.400]  Don't care about dying, super brave, super crazy
[02:41:51.400 --> 02:41:53.400]  And then
[02:41:53.400 --> 02:41:55.400]  Half of them are
[02:41:55.400 --> 02:41:57.400]  Or more gay
[02:41:57.400 --> 02:41:59.400]  I mean, you just can't make this stuff up
[02:41:59.400 --> 02:42:01.400]  Women got hoods over their heads, they throw acid on them
[02:42:01.400 --> 02:42:03.400]  They talk back, the leftists all love it
[02:42:03.400 --> 02:42:05.400]  A bunch of fruit loops, what do you make of that?
[02:42:05.400 --> 02:42:07.400]  Oh my god, it's crazy
[02:42:07.400 --> 02:42:09.400]  Donald Trump's got to protect himself on that
[02:42:09.400 --> 02:42:11.400]  Because they're going to try and pull that
[02:42:11.400 --> 02:42:13.400]  And if they took out 50,000 troops out of our country
[02:42:13.400 --> 02:42:15.400]  Okay, those are our Americans
[02:42:15.400 --> 02:42:17.400]  You know, we need to close the borders
[02:42:17.400 --> 02:42:19.400]  And keep the borders tight
[02:42:19.400 --> 02:42:21.400]  We need to have people here to protect us
[02:42:21.400 --> 02:42:43.400]  I agree, Afghanistan is a pedophile palace
[02:42:43.400 --> 02:42:57.400]  We're not just going to have to end to the next week

[02:43:11.400 --> 02:43:13.400]  Next level compared to whey
[02:43:13.400 --> 02:43:15.400]  And it's great to mix with whey and then make shakes
[02:43:15.400 --> 02:43:19.400]  It's incredible, my son is growing like a weed using it

[03:18:26.400 --> 03:18:28.400]  They know how great it is.

[03:19:09.400 --> 03:19:14.400]  You talk about next level meal replacement, next level compared to whey, and it's great to mix with whey and then make shakes.
[03:19:14.400 --> 03:19:22.400]  It's incredible. My son is growing like a weed using it. It's bigger than I am already. 15, incredible. It is amazing.

[03:19:31.400 --> 03:19:36.400]  We're the tip of the spear because we're fearless. We're bold because we understand the stakes are too high.
[03:19:36.400 --> 03:19:42.400]  The globalists win. We're all slaves. So don't thank me for what I'm doing. I want to thank you. We're all in this together.
[03:19:42.400 --> 03:19:48.400]  And when you get the great Molan Lobby t-shirts, you get the great books and videos, you're fighting the tip of the spear.
[03:19:48.400 --> 03:20:14.400]  Again, visit InfowarsStore.com today and commit to helping the Infowar.
[03:20:14.400 --> 03:20:21.400]  Jack Pascovic coming in here fourth hour, Alex Jones show. I want to thank Alex so much for having me on today.
[03:20:21.400 --> 03:20:30.400]  And I appreciate it. Honestly, an hour. I don't know if that's going to be enough to break down all of the news and the intel that I have to share.
[03:20:30.400 --> 03:20:38.400]  I broke this down a little bit on my personal Twitter page, my periscope. If you guys have seen that earlier this week, I teased out a little bit of what's going on.
[03:20:38.400 --> 03:20:45.400]  But there's so much coming out in the Uranium One investigation. There's so much that's happening honestly on a day to day basis.
[03:20:45.400 --> 03:20:56.400]  Things that I got from sources just last night, people that I've talked to this morning, it's changing on a day to day basis because the people that were behind that entire scheme,
[03:20:56.400 --> 03:21:03.400]  that entire situation are trying to jump through hoops and move one step ahead of the investigation, one step ahead of the media,
[03:21:03.400 --> 03:21:10.400]  and one step of those of us in alternative media that are breaking down what exactly is going on and what exactly happened with that configuration.
[03:21:10.400 --> 03:21:21.400]  But before I really break down all that stuff, I do want to remind you guys about the Infowars store, infowars.com, or excuse me, infowarsstore.com.
[03:21:21.400 --> 03:21:28.400]  That is where you can go to find all of the incredible specials that help keep the Infowar going.
[03:21:28.400 --> 03:21:38.400]  And that's why it's considered a win-win situation because what you're doing is you're supporting the broadcast and you're also getting help for yourself.
[03:21:38.400 --> 03:21:46.400]  You're getting some fun and great products for your health and also this wonderful t-shirt, anti-fascist and anti-communist.
[03:21:46.400 --> 03:21:56.400]  And isn't that the perfect t-shirt for someone who's a patriotic American who loves their country and doesn't believe in extremism on either side?
[03:21:56.400 --> 03:22:01.400]  Because we are anti-fascism and we are anti-communism.
[03:22:01.400 --> 03:22:05.400]  So it's sort of a play on the other shirts out there, the other symbols.
[03:22:05.400 --> 03:22:11.400]  But in this case, we're standing with the United States of America and it's got the don't tread on me flag on there.
[03:22:11.400 --> 03:22:20.400]  I actually ordered mine earlier today when I saw that hilarious ad that Alex and Owen and everybody cut the Infowars dogs, Reservoir dogs kind of ad.
[03:22:20.400 --> 03:22:22.400]  It was hilarious. It was so good.
[03:22:22.400 --> 03:22:26.400]  That is the kind of t-shirt that right there, when you put that up, you're walking down the street.
[03:22:26.400 --> 03:22:35.400]  You are going to be triggering so many people when they see this because they're going to say, wait, I didn't know that we had to talk about fascism and communism.
[03:22:35.400 --> 03:22:37.400]  You don't support one of those. Which one are you?
[03:22:37.400 --> 03:22:41.400]  And you just say, I'm an American. I support my country and I love this country.
[03:22:41.400 --> 03:22:43.400]  That is one of the greatest things out there.
[03:22:43.400 --> 03:22:48.400]  I want you guys to go and check it out because that t-shirt is absolutely hilarious.
[03:22:48.400 --> 03:22:55.400]  Probably the other product I wanted to mention is BrainForce Plus 50. It's super charged.
[03:22:55.400 --> 03:23:01.400]  It is currently on sale, 50% off if you guys go and look at it in the Infowars store.
[03:23:01.400 --> 03:23:06.400]  You guys can pick it up at a super reduced price right now.
[03:23:06.400 --> 03:23:08.400]  This is the stuff I've tried BrainForce.
[03:23:08.400 --> 03:23:13.400]  Tanya was a little concerned. She said, Jack, what's going to happen when you try that BrainForce?
[03:23:13.400 --> 03:23:15.400]  And I said, I don't know, but let's give it a shot. We're talking about it.
[03:23:15.400 --> 03:23:19.400]  I want to know what it's like. And I'm telling you, it opens your mind.
[03:23:19.400 --> 03:23:23.400]  It gives you a clear feeling. It gives you a lot of clarity.
[03:23:23.400 --> 03:23:26.400]  It's not the kind of jitteriness. I was in the military.
[03:23:26.400 --> 03:23:29.400]  When I would deploy, we would take energy drink after energy drink.
[03:23:29.400 --> 03:23:33.400]  But this BrainForce, that makes you jittery. It makes you irritated.
[03:23:33.400 --> 03:23:38.400]  BrainForce is not like that. BrainForce helps to make you feel more open, more calm.
[03:23:38.400 --> 03:23:41.400]  And it's almost warm. I always describe it as kind of a warm feeling.
[03:23:41.400 --> 03:23:45.400]  So that is why that is one of the products that I absolutely recommend.
[03:23:45.400 --> 03:23:49.400]  And I appreciate it. I've actually tried it and use it myself.
[03:23:49.400 --> 03:23:53.400]  Folks, Uranium One. The Uranium One story will not go away.
[03:23:53.400 --> 03:23:57.400]  And in fact, the investigation is getting bigger and bigger.
[03:23:57.400 --> 03:24:10.400]  Just this morning, it was confirmed that President Trump himself is the one that gave the order for the FBI informant to be allowed to testify before Congress.
[03:24:10.400 --> 03:24:15.400]  So we had had that reported from sources before. Now it's confirmed that the President of the United States, President Trump,
[03:24:15.400 --> 03:24:18.400]  and I don't think you'd find any other president that would allow this,
[03:24:18.400 --> 03:24:23.400]  he went to the DOJ and said, lift the gag order on this informant.
[03:24:23.400 --> 03:24:28.400]  So there's a confidential informant, someone that we had that was on, essentially,
[03:24:28.400 --> 03:24:35.400]  on the payroll or intimately knew the details of the Uranium One deal,
[03:24:35.400 --> 03:24:41.400]  where there's considerations that he may have actually gone to Russia and been part of this and turned over documents.
[03:24:41.400 --> 03:24:45.400]  He's been trying to get this out to congressional investigators for years,
[03:24:45.400 --> 03:24:48.400]  but the Obama DOJ wouldn't let him.
[03:24:48.400 --> 03:24:54.400]  President Trump himself has now said that this confidential informant should come out.
[03:24:54.400 --> 03:24:58.400]  But here's what's breaking news is that now, what my sources are telling me,
[03:24:58.400 --> 03:25:06.400]  is that Senator Chuck Grassley and the other Democrats on the committee, on the Juiciery Committee,
[03:25:06.400 --> 03:25:12.400]  are at odds as to how the informant's testimony should come out in the Senate in the committee.
[03:25:12.400 --> 03:25:16.400]  And they're currently split on it because it's split down party lines.
[03:25:16.400 --> 03:25:21.400]  The Republicans are saying we want this to be as open and transparent as possible.
[03:25:21.400 --> 03:25:24.400]  The Democrats are saying that it shouldn't happen.
[03:25:24.400 --> 03:25:28.400]  There's so much infighting, the Democrats are trying to do everything they can to stall this.
[03:25:28.400 --> 03:25:36.400]  And the latest that I've heard on this is that they're even discussing having separate hearings for the informant,
[03:25:36.400 --> 03:25:40.400]  one for the Republicans and one for the Democrats.
[03:25:40.400 --> 03:25:45.400]  So folks doesn't take a genius to explain what's going to happen if they do something like that.
[03:25:45.400 --> 03:25:49.400]  What's going to happen is the Republicans are going to come out and say, oh, well, he said this.
[03:25:49.400 --> 03:25:53.400]  And then the Democrats are going to come out and say, no, no, no, you're wrong, he told us this.
[03:25:53.400 --> 03:25:56.400]  And therefore, if the two stories don't match up, he's discredited.
[03:25:56.400 --> 03:25:58.400]  This is something you do.
[03:25:58.400 --> 03:26:04.400]  Instead of playing one side against the other, they're playing their investigation off of another investigation.
[03:26:04.400 --> 03:26:11.400]  It's actually parallel investigation to have one informant give testimony to two separate sets of investigators,
[03:26:11.400 --> 03:26:14.400]  in this case being the United States Senate, the Judiciary Committee.
[03:26:14.400 --> 03:26:18.400]  So that is an absolute travesty of justice.
[03:26:18.400 --> 03:26:24.400]  There should be no call for a separate hearing of this informant.
[03:26:24.400 --> 03:26:28.400]  There wasn't separate hearings when Roger Stone went and testified to the Intel Committee.
[03:26:28.400 --> 03:26:31.400]  There wasn't a separate hearing when Donald Trump Jr. went and testified.
[03:26:31.400 --> 03:26:33.400]  Why would there be partisan hearings?
[03:26:33.400 --> 03:26:36.400]  Because they're injecting partisanship into the process.
[03:26:36.400 --> 03:26:42.400]  And once they do that, they can simply run around like Hillary Clinton used to do and say it's a vast right-wing conspiracy
[03:26:42.400 --> 03:26:44.400]  and try to discredit this.
[03:26:44.400 --> 03:26:51.400]  Because Uranium One, as it really stands, and I'm going to be breaking down some background on Uranium One that some of,
[03:26:51.400 --> 03:26:59.400]  in the next segment here, this is the scandal that is going to take down so many senators.
[03:26:59.400 --> 03:27:08.400]  It is going to take down so many people in dip state because Robert Mueller, we've now found out, was aware of all of this.
[03:27:08.400 --> 03:27:11.400]  Now, another example is Rod Rosenstein.
[03:27:11.400 --> 03:27:15.400]  There was a confidential informant, right? Who was running the informant?
[03:27:15.400 --> 03:27:21.400]  Well, now we find that the informant was working for Rod Rosenstein who was running the investigation.
[03:27:21.400 --> 03:27:23.400]  So if he was running him, why then?
[03:27:23.400 --> 03:27:33.400]  And Senator Grassley even brought this up and said, why was Rosenstein not forthwith with the fact that he had an informant
[03:27:33.400 --> 03:27:38.400]  on the payroll of Uranium One, or at least on the payroll of someone involved with the deal,
[03:27:38.400 --> 03:27:46.400]  that knew all about what was going on, whereas Rosenstein himself hasn't mentioned a single thing to the congressional investigators
[03:27:46.400 --> 03:27:51.400]  or to the Senate about this despite being questioned about it numerous times.
[03:27:51.400 --> 03:27:59.400]  This is a clear obstruction on the part of Rosenstein and a clear example, potentially, of him trying to protect his good old friend
[03:27:59.400 --> 03:28:05.400]  that he hired to run the Russian investigation, none other than Mr. Robert Mueller.
[03:28:05.400 --> 03:28:11.400]  Ladies and gentlemen, you're not going to hear this type of information in the lying mainstream media to borrow a phrase.
[03:28:11.400 --> 03:28:14.400]  You're not going to hear this type of information on other platforms.
[03:28:14.400 --> 03:28:22.400]  That is why we ask you to stick it here with InfoWars, because we can bring the questions together to do things that journalists used to do.
[03:28:22.400 --> 03:28:29.400]  And that's ask hard questions to connect dots and to do investigation into these matters,
[03:28:29.400 --> 03:28:34.400]  instead of simply parroting talking points and government press releases whenever they're sent out to us.
[03:28:34.400 --> 03:28:39.400]  I'm Jack Pasobic. I'm going to be here. We've got 30 minutes to go. I'm going to cover some more stuff.
[03:28:39.400 --> 03:28:48.400]  But in the next segment, what I'm going to do is talk about specifically, if they sold 20% of the uranium, where did the uranium come from
[03:28:48.400 --> 03:29:15.400]  and where did the uranium go? Stay tuned.
[03:29:19.400 --> 03:29:22.400]  You have the right to remain private.

[03:30:54.400 --> 03:31:01.400]  You know, someone very profoundly once said many years ago that if fascism ever comes to America, it'll come in the name of liberalism.
[03:31:01.400 --> 03:31:04.400]  You're a white man! You're a white man!
[03:31:04.400 --> 03:31:14.400]  Welcome to The War Room, the latest expansion in InfoWars live broadcasting.
[03:31:14.400 --> 03:31:22.400]  We are live weekdays from 3 to 6 PM central at infowars.com slash so and this YouTube channel right here that you've landed on.
[03:31:22.400 --> 03:31:29.400]  Please subscribe to the channel for updates and notifications. You can follow us on Twitter at War Room Show.
[03:31:29.400 --> 03:31:37.400]  We're going to have the most powerful guests, the most powerful hosts. We'll be hearing from Alex Jones regularly as well as taking your phone calls.
[03:31:37.400 --> 03:31:54.400]  The liberal establishment media has controlled the narrative for too long. The silent majority is no longer silent. This is The War Room.
[03:32:08.400 --> 03:32:13.400]  And more than 30,000 that have been released previously but with heavy redactions.
[03:32:13.400 --> 03:32:19.400]  This means that thousands of formally classified documents related to Kennedy's assassination will be unveiled.
[03:32:19.400 --> 03:32:25.400]  JFK scholars cannot wait. Longtime Trump advisor Roger Stone was on the Alex Jones show this week.
[03:32:25.400 --> 03:32:29.400]  He said he spoke directly to the president and urged him to release all the documents.
[03:32:29.400 --> 03:32:38.400]  However, Stone notes that the president is under tremendous pressure by the Central Intelligence Agency to delay the release of the documents for another 25 years.
[03:32:38.400 --> 03:32:43.400]  Stone said the issue is now transparency. What is the government hiding at this point?
[03:32:43.400 --> 03:32:51.400]  He believes the documents will show that JFK assassin Lee Harvey Oswald was trained, nurtured and put in place by the CIA.
[03:32:51.400 --> 03:33:00.400]  Lee and McAdoo InfoWars.com.
[03:33:22.400 --> 03:33:43.400]  Popping in for Alex Jones today, it's Jack Posovic here from Washington DC, breaking down all the latest of what's going on here in the city that has been rocked over the past few weeks with the revelations of Hillary Clinton's involvement in the
[03:33:43.400 --> 03:33:57.400]  uranium one deal and the fact that the entire situation was under investigation by the FBI but was then since swept under the rug by none other than FBI directors Robert Mueller and James Comey.
[03:33:57.400 --> 03:34:07.400]  Mueller, of course, is now the special prosecutor in charge of the Russia investigation, the Russia collusion investigation on President Trump, whereas James Comey was fired.
[03:34:07.400 --> 03:34:23.400]  However, it really does beg the question now that the new evidence has come out that Mueller may have been involved in covering up the previous administrations, Barack Obama administrations dealings with Russia, the sale of uranium one to Russia,
[03:34:23.400 --> 03:34:41.400]  the contracting of these lands being approved through the Department of State Hillary Clinton, while the Secretary of State's husband Bill Clinton accepted half a million dollars from the Russian state, as well as $145 million in donations to the Clinton Foundation.
[03:34:41.400 --> 03:34:55.400]  One piece of this that I'd like to go back to, and I brought up some of this with Alex earlier today, is that all of this uranium that we keep talking about the 20% of the US uranium, well, where is that uranium you ask?
[03:34:55.400 --> 03:35:02.400]  Where is it? Can we find it? Can we see it? Can we touch it? What happened to it? Is it really gone? Is it all in Russia? How do we know?
[03:35:02.400 --> 03:35:23.400]  So if you go back and look, there's actually a Bureau of Land Management website that I did some digging and actually pulled this up that wrote back all the way in 2011 and 2012 that they were indeed looking to secure a deal and approve a deal with uranium one through their shell company,
[03:35:23.400 --> 03:35:37.400]  meaning Oregon Energy LLC, to approve this deal to allow the development of a strip mine or possibly even an open pit mine in Oregon. The company was later sold and they're now subsidiaries, right?
[03:35:37.400 --> 03:35:46.400]  They used to call it, that's what the uranium one does, is that they use all these subsidiaries to make it look like it's an Australian company or make it looks like it's a US company or a Canadian company.
[03:35:46.400 --> 03:35:54.400]  But what happens is they're really all owned at the end of the day by uranium one, which is in turn owned by the Russian state.
[03:35:54.400 --> 03:36:05.400]  The way it works is those mines, a lot of them are a lot of the land usage rates are actually down in moleher county in Southwest Oregon.
[03:36:05.400 --> 03:36:18.400]  This part of Oregon gained a lot of international attention back all the way in 2014, 2015, when the standoffs were going on between the Bundys and the Hammond Ranch, the Bundy Ranch is there as well,
[03:36:18.400 --> 03:36:24.400]  Northern Nevada, Southern Oregon, that were going on when they were trying to get kicked off of their land by the US government as they alleged.
[03:36:24.400 --> 03:36:35.400]  The standoff happened and those ranchers were the ones that were standing in the way while BLM was trying and pushing very hard to get them off their lands.
[03:36:35.400 --> 03:36:42.400]  FBI's HRT was involved and now we're breaking down and learning that this project is actually called the Aurora project.
[03:36:42.400 --> 03:36:48.400]  Now, I know that is kind of a headline grabbing title, but it's actually because it's near the town of Aurora.
[03:36:48.400 --> 03:36:55.400]  So this Aurora project quite simply says the Aurora uranium project shows the local infrastructure.
[03:36:55.400 --> 03:36:57.400]  There's been three of these mines have been out there.
[03:36:57.400 --> 03:36:59.400]  They've known that uranium has been there since the 1970s.
[03:36:59.400 --> 03:37:02.400]  It's only been in recent years that it was sold out to Russia.
[03:37:02.400 --> 03:37:09.400]  So it used to be that these were done by US companies or done by Canadian companies, our allies.
[03:37:09.400 --> 03:37:20.400]  But then it was through the sale of those companies that Russia and the approval of that sale by the Clinton, by Clinton, that Secretary of State and then Obama as, as presidents.
[03:37:20.400 --> 03:37:28.400]  Those sales put these uranium deposits which are found here in the United States in the hands of the Russians.
[03:37:28.400 --> 03:37:36.400]  We now know, and I got off the phone with a source just before the call today, that what they're doing is the uranium that comes out of there,
[03:37:36.400 --> 03:37:44.400]  according to my source, is sent up to Canada, which has different import-export licensing than if they were sending it directly to Russia.
[03:37:44.400 --> 03:37:48.400]  So it goes to Canada, then they, so it's sort of, and then it goes to Russia from there.
[03:37:48.400 --> 03:37:57.400]  So what they're kind of doing is almost laundering the uranium and the way they would launder money because it was being sent directly from the United States to Russia.
[03:37:57.400 --> 03:38:00.400]  This would obviously trigger a lot of alarm bells.
[03:38:00.400 --> 03:38:09.400]  So what they're doing with Uranium One, which was originally part Canadian-owned company, now they're able to funnel it through Canada, then get it back to Russia.
[03:38:09.400 --> 03:38:12.400]  Here's another shot you guys can see of what's going on there.
[03:38:12.400 --> 03:38:15.400]  There's, this is one of the major open pit mine.
[03:38:15.400 --> 03:38:19.400]  It's a diagram for what they wanted, for everything they want to do there.
[03:38:19.400 --> 03:38:26.400]  These stock, the stockpile areas, the processing plants, all of this, Mulher county, very close to where that standoff took place.
[03:38:26.400 --> 03:38:37.400]  So now this really begs the question that if this huge project is going on out there in southwestern Oregon, Aurora, Aurora, Oregon is the name of the cities.
[03:38:37.400 --> 03:38:39.400]  They call it the Aurora Project.
[03:38:39.400 --> 03:38:42.400]  Here I am on a Friday talking about Project Aurora.
[03:38:42.400 --> 03:38:44.400]  I didn't think that would be coming up.
[03:38:44.400 --> 03:38:50.400]  But if all of this is going on, clearly the local representatives would know something about it.
[03:38:50.400 --> 03:38:56.400]  The federal representatives for Oregon to include Senator Ron Wyden certainly would know something about it.
[03:38:56.400 --> 03:39:04.400]  We're now seeing, you can see the data, total production of Uranium concentrated in the United States going all the way down.
[03:39:04.400 --> 03:39:10.400]  These are, these are in pounds, so millions and millions of pounds of Uranium coming out of the United States.
[03:39:10.400 --> 03:39:12.400]  I think these numbers go through about 2011.
[03:39:12.400 --> 03:39:19.400]  So right around the time this was going on, this is one of the major Uranium spots in not only in the United States, but in the entire world.
[03:39:19.400 --> 03:39:29.400]  And what we're learning that Russia was up to with its Uranium-1 purchases was to corner the entire, not just U.S. market on Uranium, but actually the world market on Uranium.
[03:39:29.400 --> 03:39:35.400]  A strategic nuclear material, strategic fizzle material that's used in nuclear weapons.
[03:39:35.400 --> 03:39:40.400]  Now Russia, of course, we know has a somewhat cozy relationship with North Korea.
[03:39:40.400 --> 03:39:48.400]  Is it possible then, it's not so far to say that some of that yellow cake, and that's the type of Uranium that you can get out of Oregon,
[03:39:48.400 --> 03:39:53.400]  is it possible that some of that Uranium ended up in the hands of the North Koreans,
[03:39:53.400 --> 03:40:00.400]  who we now know have a reinvigorated nuclear program, and they have the ability, or they're trying to get the ability with their TD-2 missiles,
[03:40:00.400 --> 03:40:05.400]  to be able to launch into sites in Northwestern, the United States.
[03:40:05.400 --> 03:40:13.400]  So I was discussing this earlier today with a source, and I said, what irony that North Korea could be striking the new,
[03:40:13.400 --> 03:40:22.400]  the Northwestern states of America, right, Washington and Oregon, with Uranium that actually came from that very same area,
[03:40:22.400 --> 03:40:25.400]  thanks to the machinations of Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama.
[03:40:25.400 --> 03:40:31.400]  Now, I know all this sounds quite sensational, and that's why I'm not Jack Pasobic sitting here and making these claims.
[03:40:31.400 --> 03:40:40.400]  I am simply calling for a special prosecution, a special investigation into this entire situation,
[03:40:40.400 --> 03:40:44.400]  to find out where our government's culpability comes in on it.
[03:40:44.400 --> 03:40:53.400]  Because if this is true, and they have secured this Uranium, and that there were payoffs to Clinton and to Bill Clinton,
[03:40:53.400 --> 03:40:57.400]  to the Clinton Foundation, to so many other people that would have had to be involved in this,
[03:40:57.400 --> 03:41:03.400]  with approvals coming all over from Uranium I, lining the pockets of everyone involved in this,
[03:41:03.400 --> 03:41:10.400]  while the entire thing was under FBI investigation, the entire investigation then swept under the rug,
[03:41:10.400 --> 03:41:17.400]  Mueller goes and invests in hedge funds long after he gets out of office, where he's getting his profits,
[03:41:17.400 --> 03:41:20.400]  we need this to be known.
[03:41:20.400 --> 03:41:22.400]  We need this truth to come out.
[03:41:22.400 --> 03:41:29.400]  We need all of it to be put in front of the American people to let them know quite specifically what was going on.
[03:41:29.400 --> 03:41:34.400]  Hillary Clinton is worth hundreds of millions of dollars.
[03:41:34.400 --> 03:41:36.400]  She's never once had a company.
[03:41:36.400 --> 03:41:39.400]  She's never once had, or at least a successful company.
[03:41:39.400 --> 03:41:43.400]  She did have white water, I suppose, but we can talk about that some other time.
[03:41:43.400 --> 03:41:45.400]  Hillary Clinton didn't sell a product.
[03:41:45.400 --> 03:41:47.400]  She didn't provide a service.
[03:41:47.400 --> 03:41:51.400]  She was in elected and then later appointed government office.
[03:41:51.400 --> 03:41:56.400]  She was in public office and yet ended up a multi-millionaire.
[03:41:56.400 --> 03:41:58.400]  What product was she selling, you ask?
[03:41:58.400 --> 03:42:05.400]  Well, it seems that more and more we're learning that that product may have been uranium.
[03:42:05.400 --> 03:42:08.400]  Folks, you're not going to hear this stuff anywhere else in media.
[03:42:08.400 --> 03:42:11.400]  That's why you've got to stick here on InfoWars.

[03:42:26.400 --> 03:42:27.400]  There's a lot going on.
[03:42:27.400 --> 03:42:35.400]  We're going to a party here in DC later tonight with Lauren Southern, Will Chamberlain, Cassandra Fairbanks, a whole slew of patriots.
[03:42:35.400 --> 03:42:37.400]  So there's a ton of really exciting stuff to go on.

[03:47:16.400 --> 03:47:40.400]  So much to break down so much we've got going on. I'm getting married in eight days, but I'm here trying to hold down the fort on the info war to let people know what's going on in this country because the forces of liberty and patriotism are on the upswing here in the United States.
[03:47:40.400 --> 03:47:52.400]  There is so much that was that has gone wrong in the globalist grand plan because of the election of Donald J. Trump, which sent a monkey wrench into everything.
[03:47:52.400 --> 03:48:18.400]  And now there is so much that is unraveling so much that would have been swept under the rug or shoved down the Iranian mine that we never would have known, but is now coming out because of patriots and because of people like you tuning in, sharing, retweeting, and even exposing and researching a lot of the stuff that we're learning about today.
[03:48:18.400 --> 03:48:40.400]  Because it's all coming out. Donald Trump was the tip of the spear. He's there in the White House, but so many of us are there supporting him from our homes supporting them on the street supporting them with our dollars supporting them with our hours of time in this effort in this great and noble effort to take back our country.
[03:48:40.400 --> 03:48:58.400]  From people who have tried to change it to twist it to pervert it into some kind of nightmarish vision that it wasn't supposed to be to turn the United States truly into the United States again for all people, all Americans to protect our sovereignty to protect our national security.
[03:48:58.400 --> 03:49:13.400]  And we found in some of these releases with the JFK files, we found that one organization possibly was trying to divide us and that organization is known as the Central Intelligence Agency or CIA.
[03:49:13.400 --> 03:49:33.400]  One of the documents that just came out and I'm telling you there are so many documents in there that it is going to take us weeks, possibly months to dig through this archive. One of the ones that jumped out at me that I saw and I saw the headline for was the fact that CIA was potentially considering a terror campaign.
[03:49:33.400 --> 03:49:51.400]  They, their words terror campaign in Miami with bombings, they were planning on bombing American cities, bombing our own American cities there in Miami to make it be tied back to some sort of plot to assassinate Castro.
[03:49:51.400 --> 03:50:08.400]  So they were going to gin up support for an assassination or possibly even invasion of Cuba, like the disastrous Bay of Pigs by conducting a false flag bombing campaign in the American city of Miami, and then blaming the entire thing on the communist Cubans.
[03:50:08.400 --> 03:50:30.400]  This is the actual report came out just yesterday. Everyone can go see this. It was called Operation Mongoose and it's way down. I know the producers are following this, but it's way down in the file, almost like 15 pages in, but it will tell you very specifically that they called for a terror campaign, an actual false flag campaign.
[03:50:30.400 --> 03:50:53.400]  So now we have information that CIA is willing to conduct false flag operations in the United States, which target potentially political opponents, and they're willing to conduct these terror campaigns and bombings in our own cities with bombs to carry out their ends.
[03:50:53.400 --> 03:51:04.400]  And you guys can read through, this is just one of the hundreds of documents, thousands of documents that were released yesterday by President Trump. And I think to my own knowledge, and this is what Alex asked about at the beginning of the hour.
[03:51:04.400 --> 03:51:20.400]  He said, why do you think they were trying so hard? Why was the deep state trying so hard to block these documents? And one thing as a prior intelligence officer that we learn is, we can say, well, okay, this was a potential operation they looked at in 1962, but they eventually never did, right?
[03:51:20.400 --> 03:51:31.400]  But here's the thing, is now we're learning about the behavior, the psychology of CIA. We're learning about something called their TTPs, their tactics, techniques, and procedures.
[03:51:31.400 --> 03:51:46.400]  And these TTPs that are now being revealed through these documents could still be the same TTPs that this organization has continued from that time until now, or used in other places around the world.
[03:51:46.400 --> 03:52:05.400]  And I know a lot of people are out there who know about Operation Gladius. Operation Gladius was a very similar situation that was used in Europe after the end of World War II, and at the beginning of the Cold War, where terrorist attacks took place all across Western Europe,
[03:52:05.400 --> 03:52:16.400]  and it was blamed on the communists, but it was actually conducted by U.S.-backed intel assets. So these are attacks, or Operation Gladius, excuse me, they call it the stay-behind operations.
[03:52:16.400 --> 03:52:30.400]  And this is completely out, it's all declassified, this was prior to that. So these were stay-behind operations that were done and conducted by intelligence assets to smear political opponents,
[03:52:30.400 --> 03:52:44.400]  to make your opponent look like they are the terrorists, like they are the ones doing this, and to potentially spark action, potentially spark an invasion, potentially spark a wartime scenario.
[03:52:44.400 --> 03:52:51.400]  So that is why they said, look, we don't need anyone to tell us that communists are bad, right? We don't need anyone to tell us that the Nazis were bad.
[03:52:51.400 --> 03:53:06.400]  But what CIA was trying to do here, we didn't even tell us that Castro was bad, but what they're trying to do is spark that emotional reaction to lead to something larger, to lead to the give-up of our liberties, which happened in the aftermath of 9-11,
[03:53:06.400 --> 03:53:18.400]  or to spark something like the invasion of Iraq, which was done after the faulty intelligence came out claiming that Iraq held weapons of mass destruction when none of them were found.
[03:53:18.400 --> 03:53:25.400]  So they're trying to play on your emotions, and we've now learned that they've been doing this for a very, very long time.
[03:53:25.400 --> 03:53:39.400]  And I don't think that's anything new for this audience, I don't think there's anything new that I have to tell anyone here, but it's so important that when we can prove that this is something they've been doing for decades,
[03:53:39.400 --> 03:53:54.400]  when we can prove in their own documents and in their own words, unassailably, that this has happened, that we have to call them out on it, and we have to bring up the fact that, no, this is not supposition, this is not some baseless accusation that we're making.
[03:53:54.400 --> 03:54:08.400]  This is your own words in your own release documents about false flag operations that you tried to conduct to condemn political opponents or to potentially spark a war between the US and Cuba, okay?
[03:54:08.400 --> 03:54:21.400]  Kennedy, they did, there were so many of generals, go back to the Cuban missile crisis, there were so many generals, the entire defense department, so many in the defense industrial complex wanted an invasion.
[03:54:21.400 --> 03:54:32.400]  They wanted to invade, they wanted airstrikes to go after the missile silos, they wanted to destroy it, they did not want JFK using diplomacy to work out the situation, all right?
[03:54:32.400 --> 03:54:48.400]  We all know that that's what JFK did, 13 days. We all know that JFK worked with Nikita Khrushchev and who were then worked with Castro to end the situation peacefully by making a deal where no war had to occur, because think about it,
[03:54:48.400 --> 03:55:06.400]  no war between Cuba and the United States would not have gone well for the people of Miami. So is it possible that these agencies were trying to spark even further conflict between Cuba and Miami, excuse me, Cuba and the United States with these attacks in Miami?
[03:55:06.400 --> 03:55:23.400]  But what else were they willing to do to get Castro out of power? What else were they willing to accomplish to make this happen? Because, and you realize this is what happens when they have these ideas, they get it in their head that this has to happen and if we can just trick people, then everything will work out,
[03:55:23.400 --> 03:55:30.400]  but it never does. Look at Afghanistan, right? Look at all the blunders we made in Vietnam. This is what always happens, Iraq.
[03:55:30.400 --> 03:55:47.400]  Now, in my last two minutes, I want to break down a little bit of news that's come out on the dossier. And we now know that the dossier was funded, excuse me, by Hillary Clinton and the DNC after reported and repeated statements that Hillary's
[03:55:47.400 --> 03:56:05.400]  campaign was not funding it by Mr. John Podesta himself and Debbie Wasserman Schultz, the chair of the DNC at the time. They claimed two congressional investigators that they were not funding it. Well, now, even Leon Panetta, the former head of the CIA under Barack Obama, is claiming that this needs to be investigated.
[03:56:05.400 --> 03:56:22.400]  But here's the thing. We were saying, well, if Obama's people are saying it must be true, and it's true that it is, but the dossier will take down Hillary. What they're doing is they're trying to throw Hillary Clinton under the bus in a way that only affects her, but doesn't affect the
[03:56:22.400 --> 03:56:37.400]  rest of the enterprise, doesn't affect the rest of the establishment. The dossier is a good way to do that. It will take down Hillary. And it would potentially take down James Comey as well, because there are a lot of lingering questions about when exactly his knowledge of
[03:56:37.400 --> 03:56:54.400]  Orvis, his knowledge of Chris Steele, his knowledge of the dossier came into play. Was this known prior to their involvement with Fusion GPS? So much to come out. So many things for us to break down and follow. And that is why you've got to stick it here.
[03:56:54.400 --> 03:57:09.400]  We've got War Room coming up with Owen Troyer, who is always great at telling everybody what's going on. Roger Stone is out and about breaking down things as a correspondent. And I'm Jack Pasobic. And what am I up to? I'm trying to fight the Info War while I'm also trying to get married here in eight days.
[03:57:09.400 --> 03:57:24.400]  So the lovely Tonya Tay is always telling me, stop your research for one second. We have to pick out flowers. You have to pick out bow ties or something. But it's an amazing thing. We're trying to bring back our traditions. We're trying to bring back our country.
[03:57:24.400 --> 03:57:41.400]  And to me, marriage is one of the most beautiful ways to do that, something I can do in my own time, as well as the Rev 18 pack that we found with Mike Cernovich and Jeff Geesey. Thank you guys so much for listening. Jack Pasobic here. I'll be back next week to talk to you. Stay tuned for War Room.
