[00:00.000 --> 00:15.520]  I don't think there's anybody in the world who would suggest, except maybe the folks
[00:15.520 --> 00:19.280]  around Donald Trump, that Joe Biden was not the apparent winner of this election.
[00:19.280 --> 00:24.920]  We're dealing with a government and leadership in Harrisburg that wants to close their ears
[00:24.920 --> 00:29.440]  to what's happened during this election, and sadly, many of the media that are complicit
[00:29.440 --> 00:34.320]  and want to write off what happened, and we're handling the most famous address, and I think
[00:34.320 --> 00:40.220]  his final sentence captures why we're here today, that he said that this nation, under
[00:40.220 --> 00:45.640]  God, shall have a new birth of freedom, and that government, other people, by the people,
[00:45.640 --> 00:50.280]  for the people, shall not burst into the earth, and everything in that state, and what happened
[00:50.280 --> 00:54.080]  during this election cycle, everything for the public in that state, this is no game
[00:54.080 --> 00:58.400]  for us, and for any veteran in this room here, who are living in a world such as very
[00:58.400 --> 01:04.000]  clear, general stop, everything for being here, sir, put your lives in a line here, play for
[01:04.000 --> 01:10.160]  a country, and see that there's a group in this state, and a country wall, to throw away
[01:10.160 --> 01:13.840]  our valuable precious freedoms here for a while.
[01:13.840 --> 01:20.720]  Absolutely incredible, you are witnessing history, mass gaslighting, mass fraud, total
[01:20.720 --> 01:26.700]  proof of election fraud, at the top of these key five states, where Trump was getting double
[01:26.700 --> 01:33.260]  and triple the numbers, he got four years ago, and we've got Trump has reemerged.
[01:33.260 --> 01:37.720]  Dead people were applying to get a ballot, they were making application to get ballots,
[01:37.720 --> 01:40.680]  many, and you know, we're not talking about 10 people, we're talking, there are a lot
[01:40.680 --> 01:48.040]  of dead people, that so called voted in this election, but dead people were in some cases,
[01:48.040 --> 01:55.280]  in many, many cases, thousands of cases voted, but also dead people made application to vote,
[01:55.280 --> 01:59.720]  they were dead 10 years, 15 years, and they actually made application.
[01:59.720 --> 02:05.120]  CNN and then Attack Fox News called it the Alex Jones channel for interviewing the president,
[02:05.120 --> 02:09.200]  because they've got him so shut down and so isolated, and they're now trying to take the
[02:09.200 --> 02:14.360]  interview of the president off Twitter and Facebook, so we knew this was coming.
[02:14.360 --> 02:19.800]  President Trump breaking his silence and refusing to accept that he lost the election 26 days
[02:19.800 --> 02:28.920]  ago, yes, 26 days ago, he is, I'm sorry to report to you, he is delusional about the
[02:28.920 --> 02:34.480]  state of the election, and about the result of the election, he is making claims that
[02:34.480 --> 02:41.040]  are dangerous, completely false, and doing so with an interviewer who is not an interviewer
[02:41.040 --> 02:42.040]  at all.
[02:42.040 --> 02:46.120]  She's not being a journalist, she's being a propagandist, and that's what Fox News
[02:46.120 --> 02:50.880]  employs, you know, Brian, there will be outrage if Fox News hired someone like Info Wars'
[02:50.880 --> 02:56.640]  Alex Jones to be anchoring a show on their network, frankly, there is not much daylight
[02:56.640 --> 03:02.760]  between Maria and Alex Jones, she's accepting the same delusional conspiracy theories that
[03:02.760 --> 03:07.240]  the president is spinning, and she's actually encouraging him, she's acting shocked, like
[03:07.240 --> 03:11.480]  wow, I couldn't believe that, can you confirm this, and he spends another lie, and she acts
[03:11.480 --> 03:15.480]  shocked, and says, wow, well, you know, people don't believe the election results, well gee,
[03:15.480 --> 03:17.120]  I wonder why.
[03:17.120 --> 03:22.600]  This is so sad, it's really so sad, it's sad for the president who's about to leave office,
[03:22.600 --> 03:26.800]  and this is going to be the last chapter of his administration, and it's sad that a journalist
[03:26.800 --> 03:32.560]  like Bartiromo, who had a storied career, is now not a journalist at all.
[03:32.560 --> 03:39.480]  Expert witness to election fraud, Greg Sincerum, gives testimony on witnessing 2430 USB cards
[03:39.480 --> 03:45.880]  being used to insert 50,000 votes in Pennsylvania, almost all of them for Joe Biden.
[03:45.880 --> 03:51.400]  This is not normal, they denied, they did it, but as of today, 47 USB cards for PA election
[03:51.400 --> 03:55.240]  aren't missing, the state confirms.
[03:55.240 --> 03:59.440]  They are in court in Pennsylvania saying please don't tell them not to erase these if they
[03:59.440 --> 04:05.640]  find them, and look for the judge to say sorry erased, so by the time Trump gets to the Supreme
[04:05.640 --> 04:12.520]  Court, oh, it's all been erased, but this is America's last stand, because if they're
[04:12.520 --> 04:18.960]  able to steal this and able to pull this off, it is going to be Katie bar the door insane,
[04:18.960 --> 04:23.520]  but America's fighting back, almost everybody else has been silenced, not in full wars.
[04:23.520 --> 04:27.880]  Band.video, infowars.com, our readership, our viewership is exploding, it should be,
[04:27.880 --> 04:33.000]  we predicted all this, and we're one of the last standing in this fight for the republics,
[04:33.000 --> 04:37.680]  so tell everyone that, hey, you see the censorship, you see Fox News selling us out, you see
[04:37.680 --> 04:43.880]  what's happening, go to infowars.com, they've been proven right, go to band.video and share
[04:43.880 --> 04:44.880]  the video.
[04:44.880 --> 04:53.880]  The republic is falling, you can save it, we're live, it's Monday, November 30th, with
[04:53.880 --> 05:17.880]  a 51 days out from the inauguration.
[05:17.880 --> 05:47.200]  This is
[05:47.200 --> 05:51.160]  But this week and a little bit of next week, get your orders in, they're ready to ship
[05:51.160 --> 05:55.360]  to you right now, and the profit that comes in funds the InfoWars, so it's a 360 win.
[05:55.360 --> 05:59.040]  You need durable food to fight the great reset, get prepared now.
[05:59.040 --> 06:14.960]  Live from the InfoWars.com Studios, it's Alex Jones.
[06:14.960 --> 06:22.720]  I used to be such a sweet sweet thing, so they got a hold of me.
[06:22.720 --> 06:30.320]  I opened doors for little old ladies, I held the blind to see.
[06:30.320 --> 06:37.200]  I got no friends to read the papers, they can't be seen.
[06:37.200 --> 06:57.280]  It is Monday, November 30th, 2020, 51 days out from the inauguration, we're now 29 days
[06:57.280 --> 07:02.320]  in or 28 days in for the 79 days of hell.
[07:02.320 --> 07:06.640]  I told you it wouldn't be resolved, I told you they would engage in the fraudulent announcement
[07:06.640 --> 07:11.320]  that he was really the president, meaning Joe Biden no matter what, and sure as hell
[07:11.320 --> 07:12.760]  they've done it.
[07:12.760 --> 07:15.840]  This has been the most riveting time of my life.
[07:15.840 --> 07:20.360]  I have been working 18 hours a day conservatively, I have been dreaming about the new world order
[07:20.360 --> 07:23.520]  and how to fight it when I sleep.
[07:23.520 --> 07:28.760]  I just want listeners to understand when I lay this information out here on air, you
[07:28.760 --> 07:35.040]  can bet your bottom dollar that it is the most researched, most sourced, accurate information
[07:35.040 --> 07:36.040]  you're going to find.
[07:36.040 --> 07:41.280]  We make some mistakes, hell yes we do, do we tend to underestimate how evil the enemy
[07:41.280 --> 07:46.480]  really is, damn right we do, but at the end of the day we have providence and we have
[07:46.480 --> 07:51.680]  God's support and we have your support and we are strong.
[07:51.680 --> 07:55.840]  I was born for this time, you were born for this time as well, but the historic events
[07:55.840 --> 07:59.120]  are taking place.
[07:59.120 --> 08:06.080]  I prayed to God before I went live on air just about 10 minutes ago that I could be smooth
[08:06.080 --> 08:13.400]  and calm and really give this the gravity that it needs, because yes I tend to get wound
[08:13.400 --> 08:20.960]  up and upset and get people to pay attention and that's good, but at this time people really
[08:20.960 --> 08:27.680]  need this information to sink in and they really need to decide, you need to decide,
[08:27.680 --> 08:32.200]  I need you to decide that we're going to do whatever it is we have to to stop this criminal
[08:32.200 --> 08:37.080]  takeover that is now completely confirmed in triplicate in spades.
[08:37.080 --> 08:46.280]  So let me tell you what we got for you, permanent announcements of never ending lockdown designed
[08:46.280 --> 08:51.600]  to make us a post-industrial world, the Davos group is issuing more statements about the
[08:51.600 --> 08:58.840]  Great Reset saying that the West is closed forever and that China will run the planet.
[08:58.840 --> 09:11.400]  Meanwhile, on national Chinese television at prestigious Communist Party functions seminars,
[09:11.400 --> 09:19.880]  what's the exact word, forums on the equivalent of their c-span, the Communist Chinese are
[09:19.880 --> 09:28.120]  celebrating the end of America and celebrating dead Americans and saying, our COVID-19 weapon
[09:28.120 --> 09:34.240]  has destroyed them, we control their people, they will never end their lockdown, America
[09:34.240 --> 09:45.680]  will be over within two years and the average trendy is so weak minded when they're bankrupted
[09:45.680 --> 09:50.360]  and they have nothing they will still love as EGP.
[09:50.360 --> 09:58.160]  So this is the globalist new world order weapon and China's right, with Bill Gates, with Jeff
[09:58.160 --> 10:07.800]  Bezos, with all these globalists working against America and consolidating power and destroying
[10:07.800 --> 10:15.240]  local economies, America is going to be over in two years, they're going to cut the power,
[10:15.240 --> 10:18.520]  they're going to cut the coal, they're going to cut the farming, they're going to cut
[10:18.520 --> 10:23.920]  the infrastructure, they admit they're going to bring us to our knees, this is the great
[10:23.920 --> 10:29.880]  leap forward for America, which means total collapse and I'll be detailing that next
[10:29.880 --> 10:30.880]  hour.
[10:30.880 --> 10:36.800]  Roger Stone has big breaking news coming up at the bottom of the hour, he was the one
[10:36.800 --> 10:42.400]  three months ago and I forgot to tell the crew to get this, pull up media matters says,
[10:42.400 --> 10:49.160]  media matters, Roger Stone wants martial law, he didn't say that, he said, Trump when there's
[10:49.160 --> 10:53.720]  evidence of election fraud, because the Democrats admit they're doing it, days after the election
[10:53.720 --> 10:59.680]  needs to seize the servers in Georgia, in Nevada and these other states where they're
[10:59.680 --> 11:07.160]  going to steal it, now there's one of the headlines, Roger Stone continues to lay the
[11:07.160 --> 11:10.560]  groundwork for Trump's declare martial law, we were a bunch of news articles about it,
[11:10.560 --> 11:15.600]  it was all over the news at the time, New York Times misquoted him, but why is that
[11:15.600 --> 11:16.600]  important?
[11:16.600 --> 11:23.240]  Well, the feds are moving to seize the servers, they've already seen servers in Hamburg, Germany
[11:23.240 --> 11:30.840]  and a federal judge on Sunday said, you are barred from erasing the hard drives and the
[11:30.840 --> 11:35.920]  thumb drives in these disputed Georgia counties, Trump is moving to get control of those and
[11:35.920 --> 11:40.000]  have them forensically looked at, the Democrats panic, put pressure on the judge, he reversed
[11:40.000 --> 11:45.600]  himself and said, they will destroy it, Monday morning, that was this morning, at CNN center
[11:45.600 --> 11:50.160]  in Atlanta, where they're holding them, you can't make that up, I'm not getting, that's
[11:50.160 --> 11:58.640]  in the suit, then he reversed himself again at 1130 last night, Eastern time, and put
[11:58.640 --> 12:05.040]  a 10 day injunction in saying they cannot erase them, following globalist operations
[12:05.040 --> 12:10.160]  in the past, I would expect them to go ahead and erase it and just not care what the law
[12:10.160 --> 12:14.480]  says, because they're cornered rats, and it's just like a criminal flushing drugs down the
[12:14.480 --> 12:19.200]  toilet when the cops raid them, that is what I would expect, but we're seeing massive continued
[12:19.200 --> 12:24.000]  fraud at every level, totally confirmed with all the affidavits, all the witnesses, all
[12:24.000 --> 12:28.240]  the hard proof, the votes flipping in front of us after they supposedly stopped counting
[12:28.240 --> 12:32.520]  but continued to count, lying about broken water mains, putting up cardboard over the
[12:32.520 --> 12:40.280]  windows, we have them, but the entire corporate press is lying to everyone and censoring everyone
[12:40.280 --> 12:44.400]  and even suppressing what the president's reach, as they continue to tell us over and
[12:44.400 --> 12:50.480]  over again, that the communist Chinese agent Joe Biden is our president, now I want something
[12:50.480 --> 12:59.520]  to sink in real good for everybody right now, communist China is bragging, and so is the
[12:59.520 --> 13:06.440]  Debo's group, via the great reset, that Xi Jinping will quote, crush Trump and America,
[13:06.440 --> 13:14.800]  that was said three years and 10 months ago at the Debo's forum, and there were the headlines,
[13:14.800 --> 13:25.280]  Xi Jinping will destroy Trump and will defeat America, hell there's a Washington Post, Xi's
[13:25.280 --> 13:37.480]  choice destroyed Trump, or save him and weaken America, John Paul, John Claude, Yunker, bragged
[13:37.480 --> 13:41.880]  on the stage, Xi Jinping, we played the video, we can dig it back up for him, you'd like,
[13:41.880 --> 13:46.760]  and declared, we've got a plan, and then Fauci came out and said, we do, it's going to be
[13:46.760 --> 13:54.520]  a virus, it'll challenge Trump and his administration, he smiled to the group, very sinisterly,
[13:54.520 --> 14:01.960]  communist China has now come out, I'm going to play the audio in the video for you coming
[14:01.960 --> 14:09.720]  up next segment, and bragged that this is the end of the country, you're done, you will
[14:09.720 --> 14:13.560]  be bankrupt, you will have nothing, they're going to starve you to death, and it's going
[14:13.560 --> 14:19.560]  to be presided over by Democrat governors and some Republican governors like the Texas
[14:19.560 --> 14:23.080]  governor who's definitely blackmailed by them under their control, very, very sad that Greg
[14:23.080 --> 14:28.560]  Abbott's now an agent of Satan, literally, I mean, I'm not kidding, I mean, it's incredible,
[14:28.560 --> 14:35.840]  he can still turn back like Darth Vader, but I don't think he will, God, it's just,
[14:35.840 --> 14:42.120]  I mean, you understand that millions have already started to death in the third world,
[14:42.120 --> 14:44.880]  hundreds of thousands have committed suicide, hundreds of thousands have died from cancer
[14:44.880 --> 14:49.480]  and heart attacks in the U.S. alone, they now admit that the birth rate has been cut
[14:49.480 --> 14:55.840]  in half, abortions up because people don't think they can take care of the kids, there's
[14:55.840 --> 15:01.680]  no hope, and there's going to be tens of millions of evictions next year and hardcore
[15:01.680 --> 15:07.360]  depression will be evident, and then they'll be Joe Biden pushing us under the water to
[15:07.360 --> 15:12.840]  drown us, like putting a pillow over our face, massively cutting and shutting down every
[15:12.840 --> 15:17.960]  coal plant in the country where we get 75% of our power, you won't be able to operate
[15:17.960 --> 15:23.280]  here, we'll have some of the most expensive energy on the planet, China, of course, builds
[15:23.280 --> 15:27.560]  three new plants a month, while Obama shut down over a thousand of our plants, Trump
[15:27.560 --> 15:32.520]  turned some back on, that's why the economy came back, but we are literally under military
[15:32.520 --> 15:38.640]  attack, May Day, May Day, May Day, this is not a drill, I'm not exaggerating, and you're
[15:38.640 --> 15:42.520]  finding out who's good and who's bad, some people we thought were bad or standing up
[15:42.520 --> 15:47.720]  saying no, some we thought are good or uncloking as enemy operatives, but make no mistake, if
[15:47.720 --> 15:52.280]  we don't wake up and fight this now, they're killing us with a soft kill operation, the
[15:52.280 --> 16:07.920]  economy first, and hell on earth we'll follow.
[16:07.920 --> 16:14.200]  Now it's easier than ever to have band.video on your iPhone, simply go to band.video with
[16:14.200 --> 16:19.120]  your Safari browser, then you click the share button at the bottom of the screen, when the
[16:19.120 --> 16:24.600]  menu comes up you simply click add to home screen, it will then ask you to name the app,
[16:24.600 --> 16:30.960]  I suggest band.video, you will now have band.video app on your home screen, despite the fact that
[16:30.960 --> 16:34.520]  Tim Cook tried to stop it, the globalists think you're lazy, but by taking a little
[16:34.520 --> 16:39.440]  bit of action you can override them, have the app, and then tell others about it so they
[16:39.440 --> 16:43.560]  can get the app, so it's up to you whether you want to defy big tech, and click the
[16:43.560 --> 16:48.640]  share buttons below, on your email, on Facebook, on Twitter, on YouTube, however you want,

[17:15.200 --> 17:19.280]  And if we expose they're the ones doing it, they go to prison instead of getting total
[17:19.280 --> 17:23.760]  power and total control, and there are major uprisings happening across the world, you're
[17:23.760 --> 17:27.520]  in the U.S. thousands of sheriffs are saying hell no to the lockdowns, people are finally

[18:40.400 --> 18:44.720]  teleprompter free Monday edition, I am your host Alex Jones, I'm going to bring you very
[18:44.720 --> 18:56.560]  grave information that isn't going to happen, we're already well into it, if this was a
[18:56.560 --> 19:05.360]  tunnel going to a very hellish place, we're about a third of the way down the tunnel,
[19:05.360 --> 19:13.440]  and we are picking up speed very, very quickly, and I can tell you that I am a fearless person
[19:13.440 --> 19:27.880]  and I never have anxiety attacks, very, very rarely, and the level of danger for children
[19:27.880 --> 19:38.240]  and innocent people is so high that I'm having them every day now, and I can't sleep because
[19:38.240 --> 19:51.360]  we're all in grave danger, and if we don't turn back now, there will be nothing left
[19:51.360 --> 20:02.040]  with this country, I want that to sink in, when you study Xi Jinping, he's given speeches
[20:02.040 --> 20:15.080]  where he admires Adolf Hitler and Joseph Stalin, he admires ruthlessness, and when
[20:15.080 --> 20:21.440]  you read what's in the Chinese communist authorized papers, it is America sucks, we hate America,
[20:21.440 --> 20:27.360]  we're going to destroy the Americans, they're pathetic, hundreds of videos of them at the
[20:27.360 --> 20:32.200]  mass factories coughing on them and laughing and putting them in the packages, China is
[20:32.200 --> 20:42.640]  a crazed communist nationalist group of demonic piranhas, that's who's at the top and the
[20:42.640 --> 20:47.040]  managerial class, the general public absolutely hates the party and is enslaved and scared
[20:47.040 --> 20:51.840]  to death, every move is tracked, they're constantly fighting back against it, they've got millions
[20:51.840 --> 20:59.600]  of Chinese and slave camps, it's hell on earth, and that's the model, and after Roger Stone
[20:59.600 --> 21:03.560]  leaves us, he's joining us with a big key until the election, I'm going to start the
[21:03.560 --> 21:06.920]  next hour on this and I'm going to show you the plan and what they're going to do, but
[21:06.920 --> 21:12.480]  when I tell you this, when I told you eight, nine months ago that it was cooked up at Wuhan
[21:12.480 --> 21:18.400]  by the Rockefellers, by Gates, by Fauci, that all came out in the documents, but I told
[21:18.400 --> 21:22.440]  you they already had the vaccines ready, that's not come out, and I told you that they did
[21:22.440 --> 21:27.160]  it in partnership with communist China because we've been sold to China and under these false
[21:27.160 --> 21:33.040]  business deals, China believes they own us now, the biggest owner of our debt after the
[21:33.040 --> 21:40.640]  private central banks, Goldman Sachs and JP Morgan, the Rothschilds, the Dutch royalty,
[21:40.640 --> 21:49.120]  the Transylvanian royalty, they're not British royalty, and that's who these people are,
[21:49.120 --> 21:52.920]  the literal descendants of Ladi and Paylor, look it up, I'm not making that up, the main
[21:52.920 --> 21:59.560]  royal family of England is Transylvanian, Hungarian, Romanian, and I'll give it to them,
[21:59.560 --> 22:03.280]  their ancestors stopped the Muslim invasion and all the rest of it, but the point is,
[22:03.280 --> 22:09.240]  is that they're the house of the dragon and they're totally ruthless and they're bringing
[22:09.240 --> 22:15.200]  down the West and merging it into communist China for a planetary takeover and the deal
[22:15.200 --> 22:20.720]  was made in 1949.
[22:20.720 --> 22:26.240]  And so, you have to understand that they only had a few months of lockdown as a martial
[22:26.240 --> 22:30.560]  law drill, they hyped up a bunch of fake videos, scared the hell out of folks, turns out most
[22:30.560 --> 22:35.120]  of them were fake videos, did send over a virus that spreads so everybody gets it so
[22:35.120 --> 22:41.440]  everybody is suspect, they admit the PCR test, German courts ruled are fake, 96% of the time
[22:41.440 --> 22:48.720]  now, it's to bring in the global grid and to artificially shut us down to complete the
[22:48.720 --> 22:55.280]  transfer to communist China and big tech and that's why Jeff Bezos made $100 billion extra
[22:55.280 --> 23:00.400]  himself this year.
[23:00.400 --> 23:06.360]  Big tech is consolidating, this was all planned, it was big tech that locked down first to show
[23:06.360 --> 23:13.560]  us how to lock down, but they were never locked down, they're making us obsolete.
[23:13.560 --> 23:18.280]  Amazon goes on lockdown hiring spree while small businesses go bust because you're following
[23:18.280 --> 23:21.800]  their criminal orders.
[23:21.800 --> 23:29.040]  Now here is Chinese sociologist Dr. Li Yi on national communist television, we are
[23:29.040 --> 23:33.880]  driving America to its death, COVID-19 has been beneficial to China, North Korea, there
[23:33.880 --> 23:40.600]  will be no U.S.-China war but we will take over Taiwan, he goes on to say the United
[23:40.600 --> 23:52.560]  States will not exist within two years, he says their lockdown will never end and remember
[23:52.560 --> 23:57.320]  Tim Cook, Apple is lobbying to undercut law condemning Chinese slave labor, they don't
[23:57.320 --> 24:00.920]  want to lock condemning it because they're the main beneficiaries, that's who Tim Cook
[24:00.920 --> 24:07.000]  is, is a soulless, empty, simpering monster, oh but he gives money to Black Lives Matter,
[24:07.000 --> 24:13.720]  oh and don't worry, Biden's choosing an all-female senior White House press team, how novel,
[24:13.720 --> 24:18.640]  it's all just patting you on the head, oh we love women, they're in the press corps,
[24:18.640 --> 24:24.560]  whatever that means, doesn't matter if the Clintons and Biden are involved with Epstein,
[24:24.560 --> 24:28.640]  they don't care, it's all about, oh women you're winning, you're getting ahead in this
[24:28.640 --> 24:41.080]  system, no you're not, it's a fraud, it's delusion, it's disinformation, it's perception
[24:41.080 --> 24:57.400]  over reality, let's go ahead and play the video and I will read the subtitles, go ahead
[24:57.400 --> 25:05.760]  and start rolling it, it turns out that China is going to overtake United States in 2027,
[25:05.760 --> 25:11.320]  it was said that this might be delayed for a year or two, but this year God has pulled
[25:11.320 --> 25:17.960]  off a little trick, right, the uncreated COVID-19 and spread it to every country in the world,
[25:17.960 --> 25:26.560]  it was, back in a little bit, to them the Communist Party is God and then spread it everywhere
[25:26.560 --> 25:32.600]  and then we stay locked down under our globalist controllers, they don't, let's continue, the
[25:32.600 --> 25:40.240]  COVID-19 pandemic is like a test for all the countries in the world, this is a test base
[25:40.240 --> 25:49.560]  though, COVID-19 is bad for Europe and America, but it's beneficial to North Korea and China,
[25:49.560 --> 25:54.240]  that's when North Korea is number one in the globe fighting and China is number two, North
[25:54.240 --> 25:59.920]  Korea has zero infections, right, so this system can do it, our system is good but not as good
[25:59.920 --> 26:08.240]  as North Korea's, we still have 4,000 dead, right, the 4,000 Chinese die virus in 220,000
[26:08.240 --> 26:12.640]  U.S., we have really lost a single person, have we, we're close to zero infections and
[26:12.640 --> 26:19.800]  zero deaths, the 4,000 people out of 1.5 billion die, that's the same as no one getting sick,
[26:19.800 --> 26:25.240]  in the global economy China stands out, we are ahead of schedule in terms of overtaking
[26:25.240 --> 26:30.400]  the United States, there will be no problem reaching this goal in 2027, the U.S. will
[26:30.400 --> 26:37.360]  not survive, we have struggled for more than a decade, in 2012 we achieved absolute superiority
[26:37.360 --> 26:41.480]  over the U.S. and Japan, the Taiwan Strait, we have gained absolute superiority over the
[26:41.480 --> 26:48.160]  United States, more of this in the next hour but Roger Stone's up front, all of its statistical
[26:48.160 --> 26:52.600]  fraud, they just don't do the PCR testing, they declare it's over when they launch the
[26:52.600 --> 26:55.320]  attack through Bill Gates, Bill Gates is the enemy.
[26:55.320 --> 27:00.440]  There is an economic war taking place of the ruling class to consolidate power and control,
[27:00.440 --> 27:04.600]  there's a headline out from zero heads that breaks down Bloomberg numbers that global
[27:04.600 --> 27:11.040]  airlines are set to lose 157 billion dollars this year by the end of December, it's already
[27:11.040 --> 27:17.240]  over 130 billion dollars they've lost, why would they take part in the hoax, in the
[27:17.240 --> 27:21.520]  lockdown, in the hysteria, if it hurts them, we'll see that'll knock out all the small
[27:21.520 --> 27:25.840]  airlines and consolidate control, it's the same in every single industry, and the big
[27:25.840 --> 27:30.120]  megabanks have unlimited capital, they want to bankrupt the world economy, go to buy it
[27:30.120 --> 27:35.040]  up for pennies on the dollar, that's why the great stock market crash of 29 later turned
[27:35.040 --> 27:40.160]  out was engineered by some central banks, this is how the global estate control, it
[27:40.160 --> 27:45.240]  stars the third world to death, makes the first world poor, it's economic warfare and
[27:45.240 --> 27:49.840]  it gives cover to the big megabanks that created thousands of trillions of dollars in fake
[27:49.840 --> 27:55.440]  derivation, only the truth will set us free, infowars.com.
[27:55.440 --> 28:02.640]  Back in 1996, the head of the world food program said that they would use food and global lockdowns
[28:02.640 --> 28:08.680]  due to a virus year to bring in world government, that also came out in the North American Union
[28:08.680 --> 28:13.840]  documents the judicial watch and Lou Dobbs got more than 15 years ago as well, so we
[28:13.840 --> 28:17.520]  know they're playing and if they're able to keep this lockdown going, it's going to cause
[28:17.520 --> 28:22.080]  not just a worldwide depression, but mass starvation of hundreds of millions, millions
[28:22.080 --> 28:26.400]  have already starved to death, not from COVID, but from the lockdown, that's why it's important
[28:26.400 --> 28:30.720]  for people in North America to get prepared for all over the world, but we have high quality
[28:30.720 --> 28:37.360]  food, ready to ship to you the last 25 years and prepare with alex.com, there's an additional

[28:54.280 --> 28:56.280]  God bless.
[28:56.280 --> 29:03.560]  You can watch a factory of robots being controlled by wireless internet commands, but if you
[29:03.560 --> 29:07.800]  were a person just 200 years ago and you saw that you think it was magic, you wouldn't
[29:07.800 --> 29:12.320]  even know really what the machines were or what was controlling them, so for that person
[29:12.320 --> 29:17.760]  it would be spiritual or it would be something of a spirit, and it's similar to how ducks
[29:17.760 --> 29:21.480]  and butterflies and many other species of animals, now how to fly thousands and thousands
[29:21.480 --> 29:25.480]  of miles back to the exact place where they were born, they're following magnetic lines,
[29:25.480 --> 29:29.920]  they have magnetic cells in their brains, we now know side-diflutes are coming off,
[29:29.920 --> 29:34.200]  there's been a lot more than that, so when we talk about the spirit, we're talking about
[29:34.200 --> 29:36.640]  all the dark matter, we're talking about all the things you don't understand but we know
[29:36.640 --> 29:41.880]  it's there, and just like you can have a bunch of robots working off a wireless system, that's
[29:41.880 --> 29:47.120]  what's going on with this satanic transmission that's working through people and that's
[29:47.120 --> 29:52.480]  how this entity behind it all is able to direct it because it is a consciousness manipulated
[29:52.480 --> 29:58.600]  in the space-time continuum.
[29:58.600 --> 30:26.600]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[30:26.600 --> 30:54.480]  All right, every once in a while, Roger Stone gets time zones messed up or maybe we did,
[30:54.480 --> 30:58.440]  he's not answering but we'll probably pop in later in the transmission.
[30:58.440 --> 31:06.280]  We have the head of the proud boys who's here in Austin, Texas, visiting, he'll be popping
[31:06.280 --> 31:14.720]  in studio last 30 minutes of the third hour, but I intend also to open the phones up in
[31:14.720 --> 31:18.360]  the second and third hours today.
[31:18.360 --> 31:23.440]  But Roger was going to be here with us covering election news, obviously I'm well able to
[31:23.440 --> 31:29.680]  do that and you're going to notice that it goes right back with the huge developments
[31:29.680 --> 31:35.040]  into communist China because that's the criminal base where the globalists can operate from
[31:35.040 --> 31:38.320]  and do whatever they want to the U.S. and get away with it.
[31:38.320 --> 31:46.960]  Steal government secrets, steal weapons secrets, ship in fentanyl, print up fake ballots by
[31:46.960 --> 31:53.480]  the millions and ship them into the United States and use them in election fraud.
[31:53.480 --> 32:00.280]  So let's go back to China out of this big stack of election fraud news and let's look
[32:00.280 --> 32:04.360]  at it because it's incredibly important and then next hour I'm going to get into the great
[32:04.360 --> 32:10.120]  leap forward, the great reset of the communist China has launched against us and how to beat
[32:10.120 --> 32:14.640]  it and how to stop it and what's going to happen if we don't.
[32:14.640 --> 32:16.400]  This is life and death.
[32:16.400 --> 32:22.280]  I cannot impress upon the viewers and listeners that, okay, yeah, we've got triple the audience
[32:22.280 --> 32:28.080]  we normally do some days five times on our own streams, our own video and audio streams.
[32:28.080 --> 32:32.120]  That's great and I would imagine when the ratings come in from local radio stations
[32:32.120 --> 32:37.360]  that carry the show, they're going to be higher than normal.
[32:37.360 --> 32:44.360]  But we should have 100 times the viewers and listeners right now because that's a bell
[32:44.360 --> 32:48.840]  weather, that's a gauge, that's a censor to let us know, are we getting the word out?
[32:48.840 --> 32:55.720]  I mean, this is a martial law shutdown designed to bankrupt the economy and the leftist and
[32:55.720 --> 32:59.520]  globalists are admitting they're never going to turn things back on and it's being done
[32:59.520 --> 33:04.240]  for a global government reset takeover, the communist Chinese and the debauched group
[33:04.240 --> 33:09.600]  and the UN and the Democrats say and they're all using the same terms, great reset and
[33:09.600 --> 33:14.240]  build back better, which means the end of the fossil fuel economy, but of course the
[33:14.240 --> 33:23.320]  fake green economy they roll out doesn't even operator work, it'll just start billions.
[33:23.320 --> 33:26.160]  Absolutely incredible.
[33:26.160 --> 33:34.000]  Disney World Economics, a coronavirus could be used to justify a global financial reset.
[33:34.000 --> 33:40.680]  It's a new article out today, oh from bitcoin.com, how incredibly cutting edge.
[33:40.680 --> 33:47.120]  In March, in April, in May, in June, we all put out articles and videos saying COVID-19
[33:47.120 --> 33:53.400]  is the debauched group, great reset to devastate local economies and consolidate power for
[33:53.400 --> 34:00.240]  the mega banks because they've been bragging the use of virus for years for a great reset.
[34:00.240 --> 34:08.200]  It's an operation lockstep and sure as the sun came up this morning, that's what we're
[34:08.200 --> 34:09.200]  in.
[34:09.200 --> 34:10.200]  Do you understand?
[34:10.200 --> 34:15.000]  We've done the research, we know the facts, we know the enemy game plan and I say that
[34:15.000 --> 34:18.680]  because there's thousands of different political ideas out there and people just get to the
[34:18.680 --> 34:24.640]  point like oh that's just one more guy's opinion, oh that's just Jones, the leftist
[34:24.640 --> 34:30.880]  is worried about transgender and pronouns and all this while big tech runs death camps
[34:30.880 --> 34:37.320]  in China and Republicans are over worried about budgets and stuff like that which are
[34:37.320 --> 34:43.840]  real issues but still side issues when you talk about the total cultural, satanic takeover
[34:43.840 --> 34:47.720]  of society.
[34:47.720 --> 34:58.400]  This is a military economic cultural spiritual takeover and if you have this knowledge you
[34:58.400 --> 35:04.640]  will survive and thrive, if you don't you will be destroyed so I'll say it for the
[35:04.640 --> 35:10.080]  millionth time, it's not about me sitting up here saying we told you so, I can't believe
[35:10.080 --> 35:15.120]  they've bragged about these plans out in the open and they're not all been arrested but
[35:15.120 --> 35:22.000]  the average FBI agent is a lawyer and the bosses are all lawyers and they're all there
[35:22.000 --> 35:29.000]  to mitigate danger for themselves and the system even though the system is feeding humanity
[35:29.000 --> 35:31.840]  into a meat grinder.
[35:31.840 --> 35:37.920]  They cannot act, they cannot take action, they were bred to be followers, they were
[35:37.920 --> 35:44.120]  bred to be part of a process, they were bred to not know, they were taking down the country,
[35:44.120 --> 35:51.360]  even while they were doing it, while supervillains like Klaus Schwab and Jean-Claude Yunker and
[35:51.360 --> 36:03.360]  Zhiji Ping laugh at us because there comes a point where they got to admit it, hey, COVID-19
[36:03.360 --> 36:11.520]  is not really a threat, we're using it for the great reset, that's Klaus Schwab quote.
[36:11.520 --> 36:23.360]  Once all this is, is a depopulation plan and once they're done collapsing the third world,
[36:23.360 --> 36:26.160]  they're already going to flood us with those third world populations and then use that
[36:26.160 --> 36:31.200]  crisis to set up world government to handle the refugee flows that they've already prepared
[36:31.200 --> 36:37.280]  and opened up the refugee corridors into Europe and into the United States.
[36:37.280 --> 36:46.120]  So let me show you the China angle on this, excellent article by Gateway Pundit, it's
[36:46.120 --> 36:51.080]  linked to the federal and state statistics, talk about no evidence of fraud, that's all
[36:51.080 --> 36:53.080]  there is, is evidence of fraud.
[36:53.080 --> 36:57.080]  It's like being out in the middle of a giant lake and saying there's no water around here
[36:57.080 --> 36:59.840]  and you're on a damn boat surrounded by it.
[36:59.840 --> 37:12.200]  These fun fraud fact, 1.8 million mail-in ballots were sent out in Pennsylvania and 2.5 million
[37:12.200 --> 37:22.040]  mail-in ballots were returned, you look that up yourself, you know, I'm no mathematical
[37:22.040 --> 37:28.400]  genius but I'm pretty sure 700,000 phantom votes is evidence of widespread fraud, well
[37:28.400 --> 37:32.880]  not according to Brian Stelter, he's God, he says it's not.
[37:32.880 --> 37:39.520]  But we have this audio we're going to play here in just a moment, this is from nationalfile.com,
[37:39.520 --> 37:48.800]  I suggest you share it, video, leaked phone call allegedly reveals Chinese businessmen
[37:48.800 --> 37:55.000]  buying bulk order of fake ballots and what do you have in Georgia and other states, perfect
[37:55.000 --> 38:02.400]  ballots not folded that it looks like a computer has printed the scantrons because they have.
[38:02.400 --> 38:26.520]  Here is the audio of the leaked phone call and again there's subtitles on this but they
[38:26.520 --> 38:34.280]  say it doesn't matter, we're going to print them, how you order them, you got the money
[38:34.280 --> 38:37.840]  will send them to you, however you want, how about the courier service, because I'm going
[38:37.840 --> 38:45.520]  to order a very large amount, large amount courier, the only thing that will take days,
[38:45.520 --> 38:50.960]  courier is rather slow, let me have a look, courier company can do international service
[38:50.960 --> 39:01.600]  as well, great I'll do that, how much do you charge for each ballot, same prices last
[39:01.600 --> 39:13.120]  time, please send me the QR code again, and again I didn't read the first part but he's
[39:13.120 --> 39:19.000]  there saying you got the money we got it for you and that's why they caught planes but
[39:19.000 --> 39:27.160]  nothing was done, flying in from China with ballots to Nevada, to Arizona and to Georgia,
[39:27.160 --> 39:33.760]  Michigan and they saw Chinese men in Michigan other states at 4am when everybody else was
[39:33.760 --> 39:41.800]  not allowed in there going in with the dollies of the ballots, I mean that's it, period,
[39:41.800 --> 39:45.520]  and if we let them do it they rule us and they're bragging about it everywhere, they
[39:45.520 --> 39:49.400]  also said in the fake routers license so folks can vote, but the Chinese consul was
[39:49.400 --> 39:54.880]  doing down in Houston, they've done it.
[39:54.880 --> 39:59.880]  You know listeners call into the show when they thank me and it makes me feel pathetic
[39:59.880 --> 40:06.160]  because I sit there and I beg you for support, constantly, for prayer, for financial support
[40:06.160 --> 40:10.480]  and for word of mouth and we're all in this together and you know it gets old having to
[40:10.480 --> 40:13.960]  come to you and say hey I've got great products, please buy them or we won't be here on air
[40:13.960 --> 40:17.520]  but it's true, we're the only media organization in the United States that promotes liberty
[40:17.520 --> 40:22.160]  at this level that is not beholden to big corporate sponsors and they've harassed and
[40:22.160 --> 40:25.880]  almost shut down everybody else, they crippled all the other groups and we're still here
[40:25.880 --> 40:30.440]  and as this whole new world order comes out in the open, our credibility is going up,
[40:30.440 --> 40:34.240]  that's why we've got to be taken off air, that's why America has got to be taken down,
[40:34.240 --> 40:38.920]  you can't have all these other nations enslaved and America is still quasi free, you can't
[40:38.920 --> 40:42.840]  have info, wars has been proven right, being on air with all the craziness that's about
[40:42.840 --> 40:47.240]  to unfold because if you think stuff's bad now, just get ready, so thank you all and
[40:47.240 --> 40:52.040]  get an infowarestore.com, get some great 2020 election shirts, supplements and so much more,
[40:52.040 --> 40:54.720]  they're wonderful products and they support the info, we're thanking you.
[40:54.720 --> 41:02.000]  Warning, warning, warning, there is not long to stop the complete martial law takeover,
[41:02.000 --> 41:06.400]  the giant third world collapse and a new world war that is going to be triggered by the new
[41:06.400 --> 41:13.400]  COVID lockdown announced by globalist systems in Europe, in Asia and now in the United States.
[41:13.400 --> 41:19.040]  Joe Biden is set to announce today that he has a new COVID task force that is calling
[41:19.040 --> 41:24.680]  for a national mask mandate to prove your servitude, contact tracing, forced inoculations
[41:24.680 --> 41:29.040]  coming but most importantly a new lockdown.
[41:29.040 --> 41:33.960]  That way he can say that Trump is to blame for COVID and claim that only a new lockdown
[41:33.960 --> 41:39.280]  will stop COVID, then of course when that new lockdown doesn't work, those of us that
[41:39.280 --> 41:43.040]  didn't submit to the lockdown are going to be blamed for it and that's when all the mass
[41:43.040 --> 41:45.960]  arrests start sometime towards the end of next year.
[41:45.960 --> 41:51.560]  This is a permanent martial law plan, Trump must be impudiated, expose Fauci and Gates
[41:51.560 --> 41:56.080]  and the UN takeover, not play games with it.
[41:56.080 --> 42:02.280]  PrepareWithAlex.com is a special website with my patriot because they have agreements with
[42:02.280 --> 42:06.960]  other distributors that they all sell the same low-price, high-quality, storeable food
[42:06.960 --> 42:11.800]  but occasionally they can do promotions on their own platform and that's what we've set

[42:53.000 --> 42:55.600]  You need storeable food to fight the great reset, get prepared now.
[42:55.600 --> 43:02.800]  The great reset, where have I heard of that before, oh the great leap forward, Mao Zedong
[43:02.800 --> 43:07.400]  ordering all the small towns and small farms to basically shut down and have the rural
[43:07.400 --> 43:11.640]  people and the small business people move into the big cities and go under communist
[43:11.640 --> 43:16.160]  commune control and that's all this is, the big mega banks want to break us into the same
[43:16.160 --> 43:19.880]  ones that put Mao Zedong into power and they're creating the process of getting rid of our
[43:19.880 --> 43:24.240]  old economy and bringing in the new economy where everything's free because when you're
[43:24.240 --> 43:27.680]  a prisoner, well everything's free but you're also a slave.
[43:27.680 --> 43:32.800]  Scotland is going to have universal guaranteed incomes now of subsistence level but of course
[43:32.800 --> 43:36.960]  you've got to take those vaccines, you can't have any kids and oh don't worry though, all
[43:36.960 --> 43:41.040]  of the tampons and stuff like that's free too as well.
[43:41.040 --> 43:42.040]  I'm not kidding.
[43:42.040 --> 43:46.400]  So give me some free paper, give me enough money to basically live in a tiny apartment
[43:46.400 --> 43:50.440]  but they own you, they control you, that's the great reset, that's why it's got to be
[43:50.440 --> 43:58.560]  resisted to total takeover and we're fighting it at infowars.com.
[43:58.560 --> 44:16.720]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[44:16.720 --> 44:24.240]  The answer to tyranny is 1776, the answer to the 1984 spirit of enslavement is the spirit
[44:24.240 --> 44:25.480]  of animating liberty.
[44:25.480 --> 44:31.600]  I'm your host Alex Jones, I'm going to open the phones up next hour to get your specific
[44:31.600 --> 44:36.920]  take on where you think this republic's going, what you think President Trump needs to do.
[44:36.920 --> 44:41.760]  I personally know what President Trump needs to do and the start of the next hour, I will
[44:41.760 --> 44:47.560]  put that information out into the ether and the whole will of the wisp and where that
[44:47.560 --> 44:48.560]  will go.
[44:48.560 --> 44:52.200]  A lot of other big breaking news we'll be covering and we're getting some of the highlights
[44:52.200 --> 44:57.640]  of the ongoing hearing in Arizona right now with Rudolph Giuliani and others presenting
[44:57.640 --> 45:03.200]  more bombshell evidence of fraud with computer scientists and others and again, you're not
[45:03.200 --> 45:07.680]  seeing this on Fox News, CNN, there's now a blackout, you've got to go to right side
[45:07.680 --> 45:13.040]  and places like that, we have a feed at infowars.com that I hope you will share.
[45:13.040 --> 45:19.440]  Look at these headlines, Biden mulling Rahm Emanuel, it was hoax works and he gets in
[45:19.440 --> 45:26.680]  for department of transportation chief report and they've got the trans tranny lady that
[45:26.680 --> 45:33.640]  they want to be the chief surgeon general over removing your son's testicles.
[45:33.640 --> 45:38.240]  The old surgeon general Jocelyn Otter said, you need to reach down to the kindergartners
[45:38.240 --> 45:43.920]  and help them masturbate, touch their genitals, yes.
[45:43.920 --> 45:49.680]  The audio's out there, oh, help them, ah, well no, Jocelyn just wanted to touch your
[45:49.680 --> 45:50.680]  children's genitals.
[45:50.680 --> 45:53.640]  No, no, no, no, no, no, how about remove them?
[45:53.640 --> 46:00.800]  Ever wanted to know what a monster looks like that comes to scout little boys' testicles?
[46:00.800 --> 46:07.120]  Let's put it on screen, beautiful and brave and stunning and want you to take a forced
[46:07.120 --> 46:14.840]  inoculation, why not?
[46:14.840 --> 46:29.000]  What a goddess, you offer up your testicles to it and delicious, delicious, bon appetit
[46:29.000 --> 46:34.800]  said the testicle gobbling creature, all right, family show, I'm going to stop right
[46:34.800 --> 46:45.520]  there, all the communist Chinese throw gays and death camps and Muslims and death camps
[46:45.520 --> 46:51.840]  and Tim Cook hops around going, I love it, I love it, like Lucky's Peter Pan or something.
[46:51.840 --> 46:57.160]  All right, I'm digressing, I've got too much news, too many clips, too much insanity, too
[46:57.160 --> 47:03.000]  much of Trump, so much to go over and so let me just, let me just do this, let me go over
[47:03.000 --> 47:09.440]  the election news right now and then I'll have my message to Trump about what I think
[47:09.440 --> 47:13.040]  you should do, then I'll open the phones up about what you think Trump should do because
[47:13.040 --> 47:18.640]  we're 51 days as the sand goes through the hourglass very, very quickly, less than 51,
[47:18.640 --> 47:25.720]  we're 50 and a half days until the maker to break it inauguration and we're only 15
[47:25.720 --> 47:33.800]  days until the Congress will start to try to certify the electors from the state and
[47:33.800 --> 47:40.080]  then on January 6th, they finally vote the electors and then that's who the president
[47:40.080 --> 47:47.200]  is on the 20th, they are as Nancy Pelosi said, we will install Joe Biden, well, they're
[47:47.200 --> 47:51.440]  not installed, they've been elected by the electors.
[47:51.440 --> 48:00.560]  So really the big dates, 15 days from now and then January 6th and we're just sitting
[48:00.560 --> 48:07.320]  here and I gotta tell you, I understand Trump's strategy of letting the courts do things and
[48:07.320 --> 48:14.160]  not making it political, the whole thing's political and now that Trump took the advice
[48:14.160 --> 48:18.280]  to be quiet, they've set the precedent that you don't hear from him anymore, so when he
[48:18.280 --> 48:22.720]  does speak out, it's shut down all over.
[48:22.720 --> 48:28.040]  So this is the de-amplification that we knew was coming, the internet kill switch for conservatives,
[48:28.040 --> 48:35.200]  nationalists, Christians, patriots and the president, a AI grid just for us and of course
[48:35.200 --> 48:39.760]  they'll get all the leftist idiots next but this is a day long remembered in many, many
[48:39.760 --> 48:40.760]  different ways.
[48:40.760 --> 48:45.360]  All right, so let's run over some of these headlines.
[48:45.360 --> 48:52.920]  I'm going to use 125% of my energy to do it, President Trump vows to reveal massive voter
[48:52.920 --> 48:58.240]  fraud and overturn results of 2020 election, hell, there's already massive evidence, breaking
[48:58.240 --> 49:05.080]  Georgia update number three, federal judge baton issues restraining order for 10 days
[49:05.080 --> 49:11.840]  preventing defendants, the Democrats from destroying or erasing Dominion voting machines.
[49:11.840 --> 49:15.480]  There's the first order saying they couldn't do it, second order saying go ahead and destroy
[49:15.480 --> 49:20.400]  them this morning, they didn't, third order came out late last night saying 10 day restraining
[49:20.400 --> 49:21.400]  order.
[49:21.400 --> 49:27.400]  I mean, you tell these under a lot of pressure, this is bizarre behavior, really unprecedented.
[49:27.400 --> 49:32.600]  Continuing, shady Georgia recount in Fulton County, delayed by Dominion server crash,
[49:32.600 --> 49:37.800]  which they then update, oh, see if you can't erase the servers, you have a server crash
[49:37.800 --> 49:44.160]  and you lose everything and then you update, that's what's going on.
[49:44.160 --> 49:49.960]  Proof video, Democrat operatives paid Native Americans to vote in Nevada with up to $200
[49:49.960 --> 49:50.960]  gift cards.
[49:50.960 --> 49:57.120]  El Veritas caught that in Texas, the Republicans paying old ladies to vote Democrat, with Republicans
[49:57.120 --> 49:59.320]  like that who needs Democrats.
[49:59.320 --> 50:01.800]  So that's the latest criminal activity.
[50:01.800 --> 50:06.240]  Rand Paul highlights vote fraud predicts big tech will censor him big tech censors him.
[50:06.240 --> 50:09.080]  Oh, Dr. Paul put that up.
[50:09.080 --> 50:12.760]  And it goes on and on and on, they're using the COVID hysteria to distract from the election
[50:12.760 --> 50:13.760]  theft.
[50:13.760 --> 50:17.040]  Trump says we don't have freedom of the press in this country.
[50:17.040 --> 50:20.560]  We have suppression of the press.
[50:20.560 --> 50:26.680]  That's exactly what the mainline press are nothing but tattletales and disinfo operatives
[50:26.680 --> 50:34.840]  that docs and bully and then call for big tech to censor anyone engaging in real journalism.
[50:34.840 --> 50:39.200]  Prime media just parrot out disinfo and propaganda and try to silence the population because
[50:39.200 --> 50:41.920]  they're the enemy of the people.
[50:41.920 --> 50:49.760]  Continuing, Dominion Eric Coomer reportedly bragged that he made ething sure that Trump's
[50:49.760 --> 50:50.760]  not going to win.
[50:50.760 --> 50:52.120]  And this isn't some low level guy.
[50:52.120 --> 50:56.560]  This is the guy that the Republican Secretary of State hired to go testify months before
[50:56.560 --> 50:59.560]  the election and get this set up to allow what happened.
[50:59.560 --> 51:03.720]  And he bragged in these forums, he hasn't even denied it, that he was going to make
[51:03.720 --> 51:08.280]  sure that Trump was going to lose.
[51:08.280 --> 51:13.280]  Continuing, the Kraken retired general says U.S. military intel group nicknamed Kraken
[51:13.280 --> 51:16.960]  sees domain servers in Germany.
[51:16.960 --> 51:22.200]  Congress confirms there was an army raid on a CIA facility.
[51:22.200 --> 51:24.200]  Now they're saying Ford died.
[51:24.200 --> 51:29.920]  I mean, this is members of Congress and the head of defense intelligence and other generals,
[51:29.920 --> 51:33.960]  major generals saying this, this is getting real crazy, okay?
[51:33.960 --> 51:36.000]  I mean, this is a Chinese takeover.
[51:36.000 --> 51:38.440]  I would expect a lot more than this.
[51:38.440 --> 51:41.160]  My advice to Trump's coming up.
[51:41.160 --> 51:47.280]  Biden appoints near attendants who spread the conspiracy theory that Russian hackers
[51:47.280 --> 51:52.080]  changed Hillary's votes to Trump, says Greenwald, of course none of that was true.
[51:52.080 --> 51:57.040]  Meanwhile, PA election official drops bombshell to special agents from AG's office showed
[51:57.040 --> 52:01.200]  up their door after she testified.
[52:01.200 --> 52:04.840]  You got Fox News swaddling the toilet and the ratings as they turned against the American
[52:04.840 --> 52:05.840]  people.
[52:05.840 --> 52:09.560]  But the really big news is the Communist Chinese printing up millions of ballots and
[52:09.560 --> 52:11.240]  flooding them in the U.S.
[52:11.240 --> 52:17.600]  And the confirmed fact, there were 1.8 million mail-in ballots sent out in Georgia and 2.5
[52:17.600 --> 52:26.000]  million cast, all perfectly bubbled and printed by a computer, he got the Chinese planes logged
[52:26.000 --> 52:33.240]  landing and airstrips in all the key contested areas the day before the election.
[52:33.240 --> 52:34.240]  Wow.
[52:34.240 --> 52:40.720]  Only Chai-Com globalists are so precise and hiding the whole damn thing in plain view.
[52:40.720 --> 52:41.720]  I'm going to go to break.
[52:41.720 --> 52:46.400]  I'm going to start hour number two and I'm going to try to summon my will to have a special
[52:46.400 --> 52:50.080]  message to the president about what needs to be done and then cover the latest COVID
[52:50.080 --> 52:54.880]  worldwide martial law UN lockdown news with Communist China bragging on official state
[52:54.880 --> 52:59.280]  run TV that America will never reopen and that they have defeated us with the COVID
[52:59.280 --> 53:04.000]  hoax and that Americans are cowards and they're taking the bait perfectly as they laugh.
[53:04.000 --> 53:05.000]  Ha ha ha ha.
[53:05.000 --> 53:06.000]  Weak Americans.
[53:06.000 --> 53:08.600]  Ha ha ha ha ha.
[53:08.600 --> 53:11.400]  So that's all coming up.
[53:11.400 --> 53:19.160]  Super villains, Klaus Schwab, G.G.P., all of them twisting their metaphorical mustaches
[53:19.160 --> 53:24.720]  laughing at us like Dick Dastardly as we take it because we're a nation of Stockholm syndrome
[53:24.720 --> 53:26.440]  one of the victims.
[53:26.440 --> 53:31.040]  They've got all the statistics how they tell troops you're depressed, you're life's over,
[53:31.040 --> 53:32.320]  you, then they'll kill themselves.
[53:32.320 --> 53:37.160]  Oh, you're weak, you're a victim, I'm a victim, I'm a, I am weak now and everyone gets into
[53:37.160 --> 53:41.320]  being weak and gets in, oh COVID, you wear your diaper to protect you.
[53:41.320 --> 53:46.520]  It's a selfish, binky blanket you have and the Chai-Com's a giant death camps and Tim
[53:46.520 --> 53:54.880]  Cook is ruroy with blood spewing out of the ground and shipping and all the fentanyl's,
[53:54.880 --> 53:58.360]  we flop around dying like dead fish, just savaging us and our average candy-ass governors
[53:58.360 --> 54:04.920]  go play golf and the fiddle while the whole country burns down is dishonorable scum.
[54:04.920 --> 54:07.520]  Ha ha ha ha ha.
[54:07.520 --> 54:10.960]  We're going to start hour number two.
[54:10.960 --> 54:15.960]  Just remember all the hell that's following is because of your inaction.
[54:15.960 --> 54:19.320]  When your pension funds are worthless, when you have nothing, when we're beyond a third
[54:19.320 --> 54:23.840]  world country, at least have the honesty, I'm talking to the minions of the system to remember
[54:23.840 --> 54:29.960]  you flushed it all down the toilet, you took your birthright, pissed it away, ha ha ha ha
[54:29.960 --> 54:35.080]  but the phoenix will rise again in your ashes and you're going to burn in hell.
[54:35.080 --> 54:40.120]  We'll be right back with our number two, I'm Alex Jones and this is the It For A War.
[54:40.120 --> 54:42.640]  This is tomorrow's news today.
[54:42.640 --> 54:47.840]  Ladies and gentlemen, I hope we can stop the great reset.
[54:47.840 --> 54:52.120]  That means a globalist-imposed, worldwide depression to break us and bring us under
[54:52.120 --> 54:53.120]  their control.
[54:53.120 --> 54:54.280]  That's the state-admitted plan.
[54:54.280 --> 54:58.760]  Justin Trudeau's on record, Klaus Schwab, all the different Democrat mayors, they admit
[54:58.760 --> 55:02.800]  it's clowered and pivoted, implode the economy to make us go under their control.
[55:02.800 --> 55:06.880]  But if we expose they're the ones doing it, they go to prison instead of getting total
[55:06.880 --> 55:10.960]  power and total control and there are major uprisings happening across the world.
[55:10.960 --> 55:14.640]  You're in the U.S., thousands of sheriffs are saying hell no to the lockdowns.
[55:14.640 --> 55:16.440]  People are finally starting to fight back.
[55:16.440 --> 55:18.640]  But regardless, you need to get prepared.
[55:18.640 --> 55:23.600]  We have high-quality, swarble food last 25 years, highest quality, lowest prices, great
[55:23.600 --> 55:27.600]  containers ready to ship but when people figure this out in a few months, I think there'll
[55:27.600 --> 55:31.840]  be long lines again to get swarble food after the lockdown has been going for a few months.
[55:31.840 --> 55:37.720]  So get your orders in today at PrepareWithAlex.com and get an additional 10% off and they're ready
[55:37.720 --> 55:38.720]  to ship.
[55:38.720 --> 55:45.640]  The mail ends next Wednesday or I guess that's December 2nd, so get your orders in now, PrepareWithAlex.com.
[55:45.640 --> 55:50.760]  There is an economic war taking place of the ruling class to consolidate power and control.
[55:50.760 --> 55:54.880]  There's a headline out from zero hedge that breaks down Bloomberg numbers that global
[55:54.880 --> 56:00.800]  airlines are set to lose $157 billion this year by the end of December.
[56:00.800 --> 56:04.480]  It's already over $130 billion they've lost.
[56:04.480 --> 56:10.320]  Why would they take part in the hoax, in the lockdown, in the hysteria if it hurts them?
[56:10.320 --> 56:11.320]  We'll see.
[56:11.320 --> 56:14.240]  That'll knock out all the small airlines and consolidate control and it's the same in
[56:14.240 --> 56:18.160]  every single industry and the big megabanks have unlimited capital.
[56:18.160 --> 56:22.760]  They want to bankrupt the world economy until they buy it up for pennies on the dollar.
[56:22.760 --> 56:26.320]  That's why the great stock market crash of 29 later turned out was engineered by some
[56:26.320 --> 56:27.320]  central banks.
[56:27.320 --> 56:30.440]  This is how the globalists take control.
[56:30.440 --> 56:35.440]  It stars the third world to death, it makes the first world poor, it's economic warfare
[56:35.440 --> 56:39.840]  and it gives cover to the big megabanks that created thousands of trillions of dollars
[56:39.840 --> 56:41.440]  in fake derivatives.
[56:41.440 --> 56:48.080]  Only the truth will set us free in FullWars.com.
[56:48.080 --> 56:58.040]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[56:58.040 --> 57:11.720]  I am a shotgun rider, it's a good song right here, listen to a little bit of this.
[57:11.720 --> 57:21.680]  This is all the Highwomen 2 album.
[57:21.680 --> 57:32.840]  And it's only fired once.
[57:32.840 --> 57:37.200]  Stop living in fear of COVID and stop following the rules, it's all lies.
[57:37.200 --> 57:39.240]  China Bragg has been to destroy us.
[57:39.240 --> 57:41.240]  I am a river gambler.
[57:41.240 --> 57:46.040]  Let's go to this special report and then I'm going to come back and get my message to
[57:46.040 --> 57:47.040]  Trump.
[57:47.040 --> 57:53.640]  It's the FEC on election, here it is, a Republican president who's working with a silent approval
[57:53.640 --> 58:02.240]  of a Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell, to stage a coup against a democratically elected
[58:02.240 --> 58:06.880]  presidential elected candidate who was president-elect.
[58:06.880 --> 58:09.880]  They've been trying this on Trump the whole time now they say Trump's doing it.
[58:09.880 --> 58:17.160]  In the light of day, they're doing it with the acquiescence of Republican senators and
[58:17.160 --> 58:22.560]  congressmen and congresswomen across the country.
[58:22.560 --> 58:28.920]  None dare call it treason, but maybe, maybe they should.
[58:28.920 --> 58:34.280]  I'm a realist, if Trump would have lost this election, I would have been completely honest
[58:34.280 --> 58:37.280]  about it and tell you, I don't make stuff up.
[58:37.280 --> 58:41.240]  They stole this thing bigger than Dallas and that evidence is all out there.
[58:41.240 --> 58:44.120]  And now the globalists are death-threading and twisting arms like you've never seen to
[58:44.120 --> 58:48.720]  get people out there, even folks we think we can trust, but turn against this process
[58:48.720 --> 58:50.760]  and say that there's not fraud.
[58:50.760 --> 58:53.920]  Election denialism is like a middle finger to democracy.
[58:53.920 --> 58:57.480]  In the same way that Rich Lager said that a vote for Trump was like a middle finger,
[58:57.480 --> 58:59.520]  a rude gesture to the left.
[58:59.520 --> 59:05.600]  We have the head of the Federal Elections Commission saying there are seven documented
[59:05.600 --> 59:12.640]  examples of election fraud, which really is organized so it's not classical voter fraud.
[59:12.640 --> 59:15.680]  Trey Traynor is the chair of the Federal Election Commission, which oversees public
[59:15.680 --> 59:17.800]  funding in presidential elections.
[59:17.800 --> 59:20.120]  Trey, thanks so much for joining me here.
[59:20.120 --> 59:25.440]  Do you believe there is voter fraud out there, specifically in Pennsylvania and other states
[59:25.440 --> 59:28.320]  that are weighing heavily in on this election?
[59:28.320 --> 59:32.120]  I do believe that there's voter fraud taking place in these places, otherwise they would
[59:32.120 --> 59:34.160]  allow the observers to go in.
[59:34.160 --> 59:39.560]  When you have claims of 10,000 people who don't live in the state of Nevada having voted
[59:39.560 --> 59:45.520]  in Nevada, you have the video showing where people are either duplicating a spoiled ballot
[59:45.520 --> 59:51.920]  right there or they're in the process of just marking a ballot that came in blank for a
[59:51.920 --> 59:52.920]  voter.
[59:52.920 --> 59:55.800]  That's a process that needs to be observed by election observers.
[59:55.800 --> 59:59.880]  State law allows those observers to be in there, and if they're not, then the law's not being
[59:59.880 --> 1:00:03.160]  followed making this an illegitimate election.
[1:00:03.160 --> 1:00:09.120]  And then you have Senator Cramer saying Trump has every right to pursue legal avenues available
[1:00:09.120 --> 1:00:10.120]  to him.
[1:00:10.120 --> 1:00:13.040]  Do you concur with Senator Toomey that it is now over?
[1:00:13.040 --> 1:00:18.200]  Chuck, first of all, again, thanks for the opportunity to be with you, and no, I do not,
[1:00:18.200 --> 1:00:20.920]  although I think it's very likely.
[1:00:20.920 --> 1:00:26.520]  That said, I think we, again, I don't know why we're so easily offended by a president
[1:00:26.520 --> 1:00:32.080]  that's carrying out all of his legal options in court, not enhancing, you know, encouraging
[1:00:32.080 --> 1:00:38.320]  any riots or burnings of buildings or beating up of Democrats coming out of Democratic meetings
[1:00:38.320 --> 1:00:39.320]  or events.
[1:00:39.320 --> 1:00:44.680]  It's just a simple legal process, and really, there have not been a lot of evidentiary hearings
[1:00:44.680 --> 1:00:47.640]  that have involved the Trump case.
[1:00:47.640 --> 1:00:52.440]  There have been other hearings, and I noticed that you used a number that was rather large
[1:00:52.440 --> 1:00:57.520]  of cases that have been thrown out or dismissed, but when it comes down to actually looking
[1:00:57.520 --> 1:01:01.920]  at evidence, there have not been many, if any, and maybe the Pennsylvania one was the
[1:01:01.920 --> 1:01:02.920]  first one.
[1:01:02.920 --> 1:01:04.960]  So I think everyone ought to calm down a little bit.
[1:01:04.960 --> 1:01:06.960]  I don't see this as an attack on our democracy.
[1:01:06.960 --> 1:01:13.240]  I mean, we spent four years listening to news shows and liberals discrediting, trying to
[1:01:13.240 --> 1:01:18.280]  discredit the Trump administration to the point of spying on him by the last administration.
[1:01:18.280 --> 1:01:24.040]  $40 million spent on a independent counsel that started with no evidence and ended proving
[1:01:24.040 --> 1:01:25.040]  that there was no evidence.
[1:01:25.040 --> 1:01:27.040]  And then, of course, this crazy impeachment.
[1:01:27.040 --> 1:01:34.280]  So I think what we're experiencing now, everyone ought to just relax and let it play out in
[1:01:34.280 --> 1:01:35.280]  the legal way.
[1:01:35.280 --> 1:01:36.280]  We'll be just fine.
[1:01:36.280 --> 1:01:41.160]  The idea that he's a dictator, the idea that this is criminal, the idea that it's unprecedented,
[1:01:41.160 --> 1:01:43.240]  it's just a lie on his face.
[1:01:43.240 --> 1:01:49.480]  It's just unheard of, and as was said, it's never been done in the history of this country.
[1:01:49.480 --> 1:01:53.960]  This is voter suppression.
[1:01:53.960 --> 1:01:58.280]  The trick that social engineers use is very, very simple.
[1:01:58.280 --> 1:02:04.800]  They just teach us that the architecture of civilization, that the trajectory of a species
[1:02:04.800 --> 1:02:10.960]  is designed by these ever-knowing, loving, liberal technocrats, and that if we just sit
[1:02:10.960 --> 1:02:14.800]  back and enjoy the ride, everything will be great, but then they tell us that humans
[1:02:14.800 --> 1:02:18.880]  are obsolete, not essential, and we're bad for the earth, and we need to be phased out.
[1:02:18.880 --> 1:02:25.440]  So they're very open about what they're doing, and they count on us just being very passive
[1:02:25.440 --> 1:02:29.800]  living in the matrix-like system that they're building.
[1:02:29.800 --> 1:02:34.880]  But what defines humans more than anything from the rest of the, quote, animal kingdom
[1:02:34.880 --> 1:02:36.920]  is that we control our environment.
[1:02:36.920 --> 1:02:39.040]  We build our own environments.
[1:02:39.040 --> 1:02:40.400]  We create our own systems.
[1:02:40.400 --> 1:02:46.920]  We really geo-engineer and terraform the planet, and it systems towards our aims.
[1:02:46.920 --> 1:02:50.520]  Instead, we're acting like animals, and they and the globalists play the part of humans
[1:02:50.520 --> 1:03:08.040]  and us as cattle, and that's the trick.
[1:03:08.040 --> 1:03:24.520]  In the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[1:03:24.520 --> 1:03:35.520]  The United States of America is under foreign multinational economic and psychological warfare
[1:03:35.520 --> 1:03:38.520]  attack.
[1:03:38.520 --> 1:03:43.120]  High-level government officials in China have bragged about this.
[1:03:43.120 --> 1:03:47.520]  They've had government-sponsored forums on their national television bragging about
[1:03:47.520 --> 1:03:48.520]  this.
[1:03:48.520 --> 1:03:50.560]  I'll show you evidence in a moment.
[1:03:50.560 --> 1:03:53.520]  And so it's not just President Trump's right.
[1:03:53.520 --> 1:04:00.520]  It is President Trump's duty to speak to the American people from the Resolute Desk in
[1:04:00.520 --> 1:04:06.720]  the Oval Office as the Commander-in-Chief, not calling in on Fox and Friends, not calling
[1:04:06.720 --> 1:04:19.240]  in on Fox Business, not calling in on a Pennsylvania hearing, but actually leveling with the American
[1:04:19.240 --> 1:04:25.800]  people about the fact that the lockdown is being used worldwide to start the third world,
[1:04:25.800 --> 1:04:30.840]  implode the economy, and vertically integrate it into the Fortune 100 that have all been
[1:04:30.840 --> 1:04:35.080]  making record profits during the lockdown because they deem themselves essential and
[1:04:35.080 --> 1:04:37.920]  small businesses not.
[1:04:37.920 --> 1:04:44.440]  President Trump has to level with the American people, not with a tweet saying, I don't concede
[1:04:44.440 --> 1:04:49.320]  biggest election fraud in history.
[1:04:49.320 --> 1:04:50.520]  That's a side issue.
[1:04:50.520 --> 1:04:57.200]  It needs to be the President looking right in that camera with the camera zoomed in right
[1:04:57.200 --> 1:05:05.480]  on his eyes, talking directly to the people of the world, not just the United States,
[1:05:05.480 --> 1:05:11.240]  and calling out the evil Empire Communist China, and Bill Gates, and Fauci, and the Wuhan
[1:05:11.240 --> 1:05:16.360]  Lab, and how they engineered the virus, and it will destroy them because all that news
[1:05:16.360 --> 1:05:20.720]  came out before Trump was even elected four years ago.
[1:05:20.720 --> 1:05:26.600]  It was in New Scientist, it was in Newsweek, that they had Chapel Hill, Gain of Function,
[1:05:26.600 --> 1:05:32.960]  Coronavirus, Bat Virus, it was called COVID-19 two years ago in World Bank and IMF reports,
[1:05:32.960 --> 1:05:40.000]  China, under Bill Gates, and Fauci was running 11 programs in that lab, and when they knew
[1:05:40.000 --> 1:05:44.400]  the impeachment was going to fail, they went ahead with Operation Lockstep, cooked up by
[1:05:44.400 --> 1:05:50.360]  the Rockefellers and Gates, Gates admits this is a drill, Klaus Schwab admits it's a drill,
[1:05:50.360 --> 1:05:55.920]  to take control, to have the UN, global government take control and defeat the nation state with
[1:05:55.920 --> 1:06:00.720]  a global crisis, where a global government is a solution.
[1:06:00.720 --> 1:06:10.280]  President Trump must come out in an Oval Office address, state the facts, and then stand up
[1:06:10.280 --> 1:06:17.920]  with a PowerPoint presentation with 20 slides that show where it came from, who did it?
[1:06:17.920 --> 1:06:22.960]  Because if he doesn't, his family, and America, and myself, everybody else, we'll go into
[1:06:22.960 --> 1:06:29.520]  the next phase of enslavement, and this great leap forward, this great reset that is designed
[1:06:29.520 --> 1:06:33.720]  to bankrupt the middle class, and destroy our capitalist society, and bring us into
[1:06:33.720 --> 1:06:39.160]  a top-down, globalist and fascist society that resembles communist China.
[1:06:39.160 --> 1:06:43.080]  The very same Robert Barron families that put Mao Zedong into power, I've got all the
[1:06:43.080 --> 1:06:47.800]  evidence here, I'll cover it in the next segment, are the ones that are doing this to the United
[1:06:47.800 --> 1:06:52.960]  States, and they admitted the Davos group four years ago, that they would, quote, defeat
[1:06:52.960 --> 1:06:54.520]  Trump with economic war.
[1:06:54.520 --> 1:06:58.600]  Fauci admitted Trump will be challenged by a virus in 2017.
[1:06:58.600 --> 1:07:05.040]  They have now openly thrown down the gauntlet, and President Trump has to do more than just
[1:07:05.040 --> 1:07:09.120]  pardon General Flynn, that's a good start, as Senator Paul has said.
[1:07:09.120 --> 1:07:18.440]  He needs to pardon Julian Assange, and Edward Snowden, now they are patriots, they are heroes
[1:07:18.440 --> 1:07:20.960]  of humanity.
[1:07:20.960 --> 1:07:24.560]  That is the beginning of declassifying the deep state's criminal activity.
[1:07:24.560 --> 1:07:29.400]  Trump needs to devastate the arrogant system now, with the crimes they've committed, and
[1:07:29.400 --> 1:07:36.640]  release everything the president has, because Joe Biden didn't just try to steal this election
[1:07:36.640 --> 1:07:38.360]  and got caught red-handed.
[1:07:38.360 --> 1:07:43.760]  Joe Biden is a Chinese communist agent, and if you read what Gigi Pink says, he admires
[1:07:43.760 --> 1:07:48.960]  Hitler, and he admires Stalin.
[1:07:48.960 --> 1:07:54.040]  And Tim Cook goes over there and praises him three years ago, and said, we agree with censorship
[1:07:54.040 --> 1:08:00.280]  here and in America, and is lobbying against a law in Congress that condemns Apple and
[1:08:00.280 --> 1:08:04.920]  others running the worst abuse of slave camps, with millions of Christians, Buddhists and
[1:08:04.920 --> 1:08:06.520]  Muslims, and them on record.
[1:08:06.520 --> 1:08:07.920]  It's not debated.
[1:08:07.920 --> 1:08:13.960]  Trump has the ultimate bully pulpit, and the ultimate evidence of what these scumbags
[1:08:13.960 --> 1:08:18.880]  have done, but he must take them on head-on.
[1:08:18.880 --> 1:08:23.440]  All the little fakes that lie in Trump's ear, said they were friends of America.
[1:08:23.440 --> 1:08:31.400]  Tim Cook, Bill Gates, Ted Turner, all of them.
[1:08:31.400 --> 1:08:32.640]  Trump got elected as a maverick.
[1:08:32.640 --> 1:08:34.040]  He turned the economy around.
[1:08:34.040 --> 1:08:35.240]  He brought jobs back.
[1:08:35.240 --> 1:08:38.080]  He stood up against the ripoff of prescription drugs from China.
[1:08:38.080 --> 1:08:44.440]  He did a great job, and now they're never going to let Trump ride off into the sunset.
[1:08:44.440 --> 1:08:49.480]  They're never going to not prosecute him like Biden says they want for made-up crimes, because
[1:08:49.480 --> 1:08:55.840]  if they want blood and they want to repudiate the liberty movement, they want to punish.
[1:08:55.840 --> 1:09:01.560]  There's an article on infowars.com, Chinese sociologist Dr. Lee Yee.
[1:09:01.560 --> 1:09:04.240]  We are driving America to its death.
[1:09:04.240 --> 1:09:08.560]  COVID-19 has been beneficial for China, North Korea.
[1:09:08.560 --> 1:09:13.760]  There will be no U.S.-China war, but we will take over Taiwan.
[1:09:13.760 --> 1:09:22.280]  Speaking on national television, the sociologist, speaking to the Communist Party back forum,
[1:09:22.280 --> 1:09:28.240]  said the United States will no longer exist in two years.
[1:09:28.240 --> 1:09:29.720]  They are weak.
[1:09:29.720 --> 1:09:32.280]  They failed the COVID test and couldn't contain it.
[1:09:32.280 --> 1:09:34.240]  That's because it's a fake test.
[1:09:34.240 --> 1:09:36.440]  Even the German courts admit 96% false positive.
[1:09:36.440 --> 1:09:38.200]  It's never about death now.
[1:09:38.200 --> 1:09:41.280]  It's always about COVID cases.
[1:09:41.280 --> 1:09:42.960]  It's a globalist plan to conquer us.
[1:09:42.960 --> 1:09:47.640]  They admit it, and he admits it, and it's so arrogant and praises North Korea.
[1:09:47.640 --> 1:09:53.600]  This is who Apple and Google and Facebook and Twitter, I mean, Mark Zuckerberg asked
[1:09:53.600 --> 1:10:09.480]  Xi Jinping, asked Xi Jinping to name their son or wasn't their daughter.
[1:10:09.480 --> 1:10:15.640]  This is sick chai-com worship of dictatorship and worship of that model to defeat America.
[1:10:15.640 --> 1:10:17.720]  It's the CFR religion.
[1:10:17.720 --> 1:10:19.880]  So we'll go through this piece by piece as he talks fast.
[1:10:19.880 --> 1:10:25.760]  This is on national TV, celebrating the destruction of America and lying and saying we failed
[1:10:25.760 --> 1:10:26.760]  the COVID test.
[1:10:26.760 --> 1:10:29.440]  It's like our own media tells us, now they're never going to take their boot off our throat
[1:10:29.440 --> 1:10:33.840]  and how it's over and how we're done.
[1:10:33.840 --> 1:10:34.840]  Roll the tape.
[1:10:34.840 --> 1:10:39.440]  It turns out that China is going to overtake the United States.
[1:10:39.440 --> 1:10:54.160]  It was said that this might be delayed for a year or two, but this year God has pulled
[1:10:54.160 --> 1:11:00.640]  off a little trick, right?
[1:11:00.640 --> 1:11:05.600]  God created COVID-19 and spread it to every country in the world.
[1:11:05.600 --> 1:11:16.840]  The COVID-19 pandemic is like a test for all the countries in the world.
[1:11:16.840 --> 1:11:21.320]  See, they said that eight months ago, now, oh, China, martial law, they passed the test.
[1:11:21.320 --> 1:11:22.320]  We didn't.
[1:11:22.320 --> 1:11:27.560]  So we can never reopen because we haven't learned to, you know, to be totally shut down.
[1:11:27.560 --> 1:11:28.560]  Let's continue.
[1:11:28.560 --> 1:11:39.920]  To test for the countries in the world, the test is biased, though.
[1:11:39.920 --> 1:11:43.720]  COVID-19 is bad for Europe and bad for America.
[1:11:43.720 --> 1:11:50.040]  And now all the Democrats, including Vice President-Elect, the fraud, say that it's in the European
[1:11:50.040 --> 1:11:51.040]  virus.
[1:11:51.040 --> 1:11:52.040]  It's America's fault.
[1:11:52.040 --> 1:11:53.040]  Let's continue.
[1:11:53.040 --> 1:12:03.320]  But it's beneficial for North Korea and China.
[1:12:03.320 --> 1:12:09.640]  That's why North Korea is number one in the global fight against the pandemic.
[1:12:09.640 --> 1:12:13.120]  And China is number two.
[1:12:13.120 --> 1:12:14.600]  North Korea has zero infections, right?
[1:12:14.600 --> 1:12:15.600]  Zero infections.
[1:12:15.600 --> 1:12:19.680]  So the system can do it.
[1:12:19.680 --> 1:12:25.760]  Our system is good, but not as good as North Korea's.
[1:12:25.760 --> 1:12:31.320]  Now, when you come back, he says, this will destroy America.
[1:12:31.320 --> 1:12:33.760]  They will never reopen.
[1:12:33.760 --> 1:12:35.840]  We're going to come back with this.
[1:12:35.840 --> 1:12:37.280]  And this is on state-run TV.
[1:12:37.280 --> 1:12:38.280]  They're bragging.
[1:12:38.280 --> 1:12:42.360]  They've been given all the power by the Rockefellers, given all our jobs, one-sided deals.
[1:12:42.360 --> 1:12:46.240]  So little pig demons like this guy and Mao Zedong, who, by the way, didn't even bathe.
[1:12:46.240 --> 1:13:02.520]  He was like, mentally retarded, can just rule over us.
[1:13:02.520 --> 1:13:07.000]  Now it's easier than ever to have band.video on your iPhone.
[1:13:07.000 --> 1:13:10.400]  Simply go to band.video with your Safari browser.
[1:13:10.400 --> 1:13:13.640]  Then you click the share button at the bottom of the screen.
[1:13:13.640 --> 1:13:17.120]  When the menu comes up, you simply click add to home screen.
[1:13:17.120 --> 1:13:19.200]  It will then ask you to name the app.
[1:13:19.200 --> 1:13:21.480]  I suggest band.video.
[1:13:21.480 --> 1:13:26.080]  You will now have band.video app on your home screen, despite the fact that Tim Cook tried
[1:13:26.080 --> 1:13:27.080]  to stop it.
[1:13:27.080 --> 1:13:31.200]  The globalists think you're lazy, but by taking a little bit of action, you can override them,
[1:13:31.200 --> 1:13:35.400]  have the app, and then tell others about it so they can get the app.
[1:13:35.400 --> 1:13:39.400]  So it's up to you whether you want to defy big tech and click the share buttons below
[1:13:39.400 --> 1:13:43.840]  on your email, on Facebook, on Twitter, on YouTube, however you want, be sure and share
[1:15:39.520 --> 1:15:44.520]  over.
[1:15:44.520 --> 1:15:53.760]  But again, the United States saved China and the Communist from the imperial Japanese,
[1:15:53.760 --> 1:15:59.920]  and then the robber barons went and invested, and built them up, and told Mao Zedong everything
[1:15:59.920 --> 1:16:00.920]  he did.
[1:16:00.920 --> 1:16:05.120]  It was a Rockefeller plan, and David Rockefeller, again, wrote op-eds of the New York Times.
[1:16:05.120 --> 1:16:10.860]  of the New York Times, I'll show you in a minute, in the 70s, praising Mao Zedong and
[1:16:10.860 --> 1:16:17.800]  his great leap forward and his cultural revolution, even if it was being condemned by the Communist
[1:16:17.800 --> 1:16:26.260]  Party at the time that had removed Mao from power and had him and his wife on house arrest.
[1:16:26.260 --> 1:16:34.180]  But there was his daddy, David Rockefeller, whose daddy had put him in power, praising
[1:16:34.180 --> 1:16:41.680]  the mass murder of 47 million in the great leap forward.
[1:16:41.680 --> 1:16:47.880]  Great leap forward, great reset, same deal, I'll show you in a moment, but I already played
[1:16:47.880 --> 1:16:52.600]  most of this last segment, there's like a 30 minutes of you want to hear it, but here's
[1:16:52.600 --> 1:17:00.520]  a little more, we're on Chinese Communist TV nationally, you talk about destroying Americans
[1:17:00.520 --> 1:17:06.760]  and how great it is and how we're pathetic and how we're not going to exist because
[1:17:06.760 --> 1:17:12.160]  of the lockdown, which their lockdown's over, oh, they did a great job, nobody's sick now.
[1:17:12.160 --> 1:17:21.840]  Oh yeah, and our own media is bought and paid for by these little guys, these commies.
[1:17:21.840 --> 1:17:27.640]  And so they all spout, it's not from China, China's great, China's good, yeah, I mean
[1:17:27.640 --> 1:17:34.840]  here's Tim Cook right here, shameful, Apple is lobbying to undercut law condemning Chinese
[1:17:34.840 --> 1:17:40.800]  slave labor, Apple's lobbying Congress that we can build against Chinese slavery, well,
[1:17:40.800 --> 1:17:46.440]  but that's, it's, it's, it's, sports black lives matter, Apple lobbies Congress that
[1:17:46.440 --> 1:17:52.880]  we can build banning use of Chinese slaves, even Washington Post talked about it, Apple
[1:17:52.880 --> 1:18:02.320]  lobbies against Uighur forced labor bill. Wow. Let's see, when it's a guy from China
[1:18:02.320 --> 1:18:08.000]  running slaves or taking organs, it's okay. And look at the hate and the, just, I mean,
[1:18:08.000 --> 1:18:12.200]  I mean over there, it's folks, if you get hit by a car, they just leave you dead on the
[1:18:12.200 --> 1:18:17.120]  side of the road. No human rights, no, and we're just worshiping it. Oh, the average
[1:18:17.120 --> 1:18:22.280]  leftist has like mal patches on their arm like, oh, it'll be utopia soon. Oh yeah. And
[1:18:22.280 --> 1:18:30.560]  it's so sick. This guy would laugh at them. Absolutely. Hardest nails, no compassion,
[1:18:30.560 --> 1:18:37.920]  no love, no nothing. Five million people in death camps, three million Muslims, a million
[1:18:37.920 --> 1:18:43.320]  Christians, a million Buddhist, he loves it. Because he's proud. He's up there on the
[1:18:43.320 --> 1:18:48.440]  communist television, announcing the destruction of America. America didn't stop us. We're
[1:18:48.440 --> 1:18:55.240]  stopping them. They won't even exist soon. The lockdowns, they failed. And our leaders
[1:18:55.240 --> 1:19:00.120]  go, you did fail. The lockdown never ends because you didn't do like Gigi Ping did where
[1:19:00.120 --> 1:19:06.040]  it came from rubbing it in our faces. All the liberals love their mask. Was it a restaurant
[1:19:06.040 --> 1:19:10.320]  you're staying? They were, they were wearing them in the restaurant and they pull it aside
[1:19:10.320 --> 1:19:14.280]  to eat and put it right back, just like they get told. Gabonist says, oh, wear it when you
[1:19:14.280 --> 1:19:20.680]  have sex and don't have family. Oh, yes. And they're like, oh, we're powerful. We're, we're
[1:19:20.680 --> 1:19:27.400]  the resistance. We're the rebellion. We're the rebel HQ. The young Turks call themselves
[1:19:27.400 --> 1:19:31.160]  fun about George Soros and all the big money and all the big Hollywood and the chai comms
[1:19:31.160 --> 1:19:36.840]  and all the big banks. Oh, you're the rebels. We're like Tim Cook. He's gay. He's a rebel
[1:19:36.840 --> 1:19:42.880]  running death camps. Let's go back to this horrible, sinister monster that our government
[1:19:42.880 --> 1:19:47.640]  won't protect us. Our media is an enemy and just up there like America's done. Just we're
[1:19:47.640 --> 1:19:53.960]  just seething with his hate. Force his will on us because he knows America is greater
[1:19:53.960 --> 1:19:59.160]  than he'll ever be. But we got seduced by globalism and put into a trance so this little
[1:19:59.160 --> 1:20:07.880]  monster could piss in our face. And the New York Times and the Washington Post can praise
[1:20:07.880 --> 1:20:14.720]  Xi Jinping and his model of the systems here. Let's let's finish up. So the system can do
[1:20:14.720 --> 1:20:20.320]  it. Our system is good, but not as good as North Korea's. Yes, it pause million starving
[1:20:20.320 --> 1:20:25.080]  to death every few years. Total death camps hell on earth. They don't have electricity
[1:20:25.080 --> 1:20:30.480]  and 90 plus percent of their country. Oh, North Korea. Yes. Yes, we could be as good
[1:20:30.480 --> 1:20:37.800]  as North Korea. Let's continue. Continue. We still have 4,000 dead, right? But if 4,000
[1:20:37.800 --> 1:20:44.280]  Chinese died virus is 220,000 United States. We haven't really lost a single person, have
[1:20:44.280 --> 1:20:51.040]  we? Ha ha ha. We close to zero infections and zero deaths because pause because it's
[1:20:51.040 --> 1:20:56.480]  a hoaxed up virus that does spread so that you get it. You don't get sick unless you're
[1:20:56.480 --> 1:21:01.600]  debilitated, but they get to hype the fear because it's a virus Bill Gates owns with
[1:21:01.600 --> 1:21:09.360]  GCP. We're close to zero infections and zero deaths because you statistically make up whatever
[1:21:09.360 --> 1:21:15.920]  you want. During the great leap forward, they had more than 70 dams fail within five years
[1:21:15.920 --> 1:21:21.360]  and kill hundreds of thousands. They just passed an edict saying, don't count the numbers
[1:21:21.360 --> 1:21:27.400]  of dead from the floods. And they just said the dams didn't fail, dams failed, killed everybody,
[1:21:27.400 --> 1:21:32.400]  but they just on record said the dams are still there. The dams are failed. This is delusional
[1:21:32.400 --> 1:21:38.400]  crazy man behavior, but he does what he's told and gets this delusional insanity. Remember
[1:21:38.400 --> 1:21:41.840]  that when you're open to something from China that breaks in a couple days that you sold
[1:21:41.840 --> 1:21:47.840]  your soul to this little sack of manure. Let's continue. We're close to zero infections.
[1:21:47.840 --> 1:21:55.480]  If 4,000 people out there of 1.4 billion people died, that's the same as one getting sick
[1:21:55.480 --> 1:22:01.480]  and no one dying. Oh, but wait, you don't see this getting censored on Twitter. He's
[1:22:01.480 --> 1:22:06.600]  basically saying it's a hoax. Klaus Schwab says COVID isn't really a threat. It's a pretext
[1:22:06.600 --> 1:22:12.600]  for the great leap forward, the great reset. In the global economy, China stands out. Let's
[1:22:12.600 --> 1:22:22.280]  hear this. We are ahead of schedule in terms of overtaking United States. There will be
[1:22:22.280 --> 1:22:31.560]  no problem reaching this goal in 2027. The U.S. will not survive 2027. We have struggled
[1:22:31.560 --> 1:22:42.000]  for more than a decade. In 2012, we achieved absolute superiority over the U.S. and Japan.
[1:22:42.000 --> 1:22:46.960]  In the Taiwan Strait, but not in the world. We have gained absolute superiority over the
[1:22:46.960 --> 1:22:55.480]  U.S. military in the Boral Sea and the Yellow Sea and the Taiwan Strait. And we are expecting
[1:22:55.480 --> 1:23:04.960]  our military at a rate of unprecedented human history. We have been launching fleets equivalent
[1:23:04.960 --> 1:23:14.600]  to the French Navy every year for several years. One French naval tonnage per year. We will
[1:23:14.600 --> 1:23:23.720]  continue to launch the equivalent of a French Navy for the next decade. As 1.4 billion Chinese
[1:23:23.720 --> 1:23:30.240]  people eat, sleep, defecate, and urinate every day, as long as we work every day, we will
[1:23:30.240 --> 1:23:35.440]  drive the U.S. into its death. Oh, I'm sorry. I didn't get to all that. Oh, yeah. They're
[1:23:35.440 --> 1:23:40.320]  going to drive us into our death. Let me tell you about that. This is who Tim Cook loves.
[1:23:40.320 --> 1:23:46.680]  But it's cool because he's gay and he hops around. Liberal, liberal, liberal, liberal.
[1:23:46.680 --> 1:23:52.440]  Remember that. Remember that, leftist. You love it. You can't have Thanksgiving. You
[1:23:52.440 --> 1:23:56.720]  can't have Christmas. You can't go see your grandma in the nursing home, but we can bring
[1:23:56.720 --> 1:24:00.560]  somebody in that has COVID and put them in the same room to kill her. These people are
[1:24:00.560 --> 1:24:04.760]  waging war against logic. They're waging war against common sense. They're announcing
[1:24:04.760 --> 1:24:09.140]  now that the left thinks that Biden actually won the election, that record numbers of illegals
[1:24:09.140 --> 1:24:12.960]  are pouring across to get all the free stuff. And Biden says, I'll make you citizens. I'll
[1:24:12.960 --> 1:24:18.280]  let you vote. I'll give everything free. This is a plan to take us down. It's a globalist
[1:24:18.280 --> 1:24:22.240]  plan. But again, the borders stay wide open and millions die of TB every year. That's
[1:24:22.240 --> 1:24:25.760]  a real disease, but that's okay. But you just can't go see your grandma or you can't go
[1:24:25.760 --> 1:24:31.360]  to Thanksgiving. Stop complying with the fraud. It's a great reset. It's a criminal takeover.
[1:24:31.360 --> 1:24:35.440]  I know you as an audience know this. Tell everyone you know at Thanksgiving. Tell them
[1:24:35.440 --> 1:24:40.440]  the truth. So they understand what they're facing. Compliance is death. This is economic
[1:24:40.440 --> 1:24:45.920]  war. This is mass genocide. And we're fighting it hard at band dot video info wars dot com
[1:24:45.920 --> 1:24:51.720]  and news wars dot com. Please share those links back in 1996. The head of the world
[1:24:51.720 --> 1:24:58.480]  food program said that they would use food and global lockdowns due to a virus year
[1:24:58.480 --> 1:25:03.080]  to bring in world government. That also came out the North American Union documents, the
[1:25:03.080 --> 1:25:08.100]  judicial watch and Lou Dobbs got more than 15 years ago as well. So we know they're
[1:25:08.100 --> 1:25:11.600]  playing and if they're able to keep this lockdown going, it's going to cause not just
[1:25:11.600 --> 1:25:16.320]  a worldwide depression, but mass starvation of hundreds of millions, millions have already
[1:25:16.320 --> 1:25:20.360]  starved to death, not from COVID, but from the lockdown. That's why it's important for
[1:25:20.360 --> 1:25:24.600]  people in North America to get prepared. Hell, all over the world, but we have high-quality
[1:25:24.600 --> 1:25:30.760]  horrible food ready to ship to you the last 25 years and prepare with Alex dot com. There's

[1:25:40.840 --> 1:25:45.240]  and so much more with free shipping as well up to 60% off. Take advantage of that at info
[1:25:45.240 --> 1:25:50.920]  war store dot com and prepare with Alex dot com. God bless. The great reset. Where have
[1:25:50.920 --> 1:25:57.320]  I heard of that before? Oh, the great leap forward mouse a ton ordering all the small
[1:25:57.320 --> 1:26:02.320]  towns and small farms to basically shut down and have the rural people and the small business
[1:26:02.320 --> 1:26:07.360]  people move into the big cities and go under communist, commune control. And that's all
[1:26:07.360 --> 1:26:10.640]  this is the big mega banks want to break us to the same ones that put mousey tongue into
[1:26:10.640 --> 1:26:14.320]  power and they're creating the process of getting rid of our old economy, bringing in
[1:26:14.320 --> 1:26:19.440]  the new economy where everything's free because when you're a prisoner, well, everything's
[1:26:19.440 --> 1:26:24.000]  free, but you're also a slave. Scotland is going to have universal guaranteed incomes
[1:26:24.000 --> 1:26:28.080]  now of subsistence level. But of course, you got to take those vaccines. You can't have
[1:26:28.080 --> 1:26:33.680]  any kids and oh, don't worry though, all of the tampons and stuff like that's free too
[1:26:33.680 --> 1:26:38.760]  as well. I'm not kidding. So give me some free paper. They give me enough money to basically
[1:26:38.760 --> 1:26:43.040]  live in a tiny apartment, but they own you. They control you. That's the great reset.
[1:26:43.040 --> 1:26:47.280]  That's why it's got to be resisted to total takeover and we're fighting it at info wars
[1:26:47.280 --> 1:26:52.640]  dot com.
[1:26:52.640 --> 1:27:07.280]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[1:27:07.280 --> 1:27:12.760]  Welcome back. I'm Alex Jones, your host. So we're taught as Americans to hate ourselves.
[1:27:12.760 --> 1:27:16.800]  We're taught of our white to hate ourselves. We're taught to hate America. We're taught
[1:27:16.800 --> 1:27:22.040]  to hate freedom. We're taught to hate private property. We're taught to love anything farm.
[1:27:22.040 --> 1:27:27.120]  And so you've got communist China that's killed four or five times with Hitler dead and they're
[1:27:27.120 --> 1:27:33.360]  totally ruthless and their dictator for life is easy being says he will defeat America.
[1:27:33.360 --> 1:27:38.200]  They will defeat the American system and he has all these CFR and all these Bill Gates
[1:27:38.200 --> 1:27:43.760]  and all these Rockefeller Foundation people on record saying it's the Chinese century
[1:27:43.760 --> 1:27:46.920]  and saying America's done.
[1:27:46.920 --> 1:27:53.840]  And then you've got state run TV with a sociologist up there telling us North Korea is the best
[1:27:53.840 --> 1:27:58.080]  place in the world and how they're going to crush America and how America's going to
[1:27:58.080 --> 1:28:03.680]  die and how America won't exist.
[1:28:03.680 --> 1:28:10.120]  And this is what people from the lowest level of the Communist Party to the highest level
[1:28:10.120 --> 1:28:16.600]  act like the average Chinese person is in living hell. Absolutely hates it.
[1:28:16.600 --> 1:28:21.520]  These party officials can kill murder rape. Anybody they want they are above the law and
[1:28:21.520 --> 1:28:26.200]  that's what Bill Gates likes.
[1:28:26.200 --> 1:28:30.560]  And so I just thought today with all this big news all the stuff breaking we should talk
[1:28:30.560 --> 1:28:35.440]  about what this is. You hear General Flynn saying it's a chai-kong takeover. You hear
[1:28:35.440 --> 1:28:43.320]  all these other patriots but I mean is it really sinking in that at Davos three years
[1:28:43.320 --> 1:28:48.600]  and ten months ago they had Gigi Ping there with Jean-Claude Juncker and they said we
[1:28:48.600 --> 1:28:54.560]  will defeat America and Trump we have a plan we will destroy them. In fact Juncker the
[1:28:54.560 --> 1:29:00.880]  headline was said we will destroy the United States economically because they had on the
[1:29:00.880 --> 1:29:05.000]  shelf COVID. We know that.
[1:29:05.000 --> 1:29:09.200]  And now they get up there and laugh and they say oh COVID is not equal. God has visited
[1:29:09.200 --> 1:29:16.240]  upon America. America will never reopen because they aren't North Korea. He just said that.
[1:29:16.240 --> 1:29:20.760]  No because they turned the PCR test up 45 times what it should be where everyone has
[1:29:20.760 --> 1:29:24.800]  it and then the average American has turned to be a victim like I've got it. I get to
[1:29:24.800 --> 1:29:32.320]  take off two weeks. I've got it. I get to be scared and be special and then a year later
[1:29:32.320 --> 1:29:43.920]  we're bankrupt we're in depression and you don't even know why.
[1:29:43.920 --> 1:29:49.240]  So let's go ahead and finish up with this little monster. This little pig face demon.
[1:29:49.240 --> 1:29:55.760]  Chinese sociologist Dr. Lee Yee bragging about how it's the death of America. And that's
[1:29:55.760 --> 1:30:00.480]  you hear Antifuck let's chai-kong fund it they're a malice group saying death to America
[1:30:00.480 --> 1:30:10.400]  well here it is as long as one point four billion yeah go to the last slide please. As long
[1:30:10.400 --> 1:30:18.040]  as one point four billion Chinese people eat, sleep, defecate and urinate every day as long
[1:30:18.040 --> 1:30:29.160]  as we go to work every day we will drive the US to its death. So he just says as long
[1:30:29.160 --> 1:30:36.880]  as we exist as good little slaves and good little cogs we will drive the US to its death.
[1:30:36.880 --> 1:30:41.280]  They're the ones ship the fentanyl in. They're the ones that make our drugs. They're the ones
[1:30:41.280 --> 1:30:47.720]  that run our country. They own Hollywood. They fund the race war garbage on record.
[1:30:47.720 --> 1:30:54.320]  G.G. Ping funds Black Lives Matter with the quote liberal Nazi towards Soros. They're
[1:30:54.320 --> 1:30:58.600]  the ones censoring us. They're the ones that have free reign. They're the ones look at
[1:30:58.600 --> 1:31:03.680]  everything. An arrogant little monster because the robber barons in the West gave him all
[1:31:03.680 --> 1:31:10.600]  this power over us as a sick joke. But you know what we let him do it to us so we deserve
[1:31:10.600 --> 1:31:21.120]  it. Let's go back to that little monster. In any case, China's development cannot be
[1:31:21.120 --> 1:31:33.400]  resisted or stopped. As long as one thing doesn't happen, as long as China doesn't produce
[1:31:33.400 --> 1:31:41.160]  a Gorbachev who would mess up China's own internal affairs. But it's not communism. You have
[1:31:41.160 --> 1:31:47.200]  a fascist model with all these members of the party worth billions enslaving your people.
[1:31:47.200 --> 1:31:52.640]  The Russians were corrupt and stole some money, but there was nothing compared to you. You
[1:31:52.640 --> 1:31:58.040]  have the global market. The U.S. didn't sign over our whole market to Russia and set up
[1:31:58.040 --> 1:32:07.000]  deals where they have giant tariffs on us, but not on them. Total BS coming out of this
[1:32:07.000 --> 1:32:13.040]  monster's mouth. The globalist Goldman Sachs, J.P. Morgan, they put Mao in. They propped
[1:32:13.040 --> 1:32:20.280]  up China. They held their hand. In 1949, 90% of China didn't have running water or electricity,
[1:32:20.280 --> 1:32:25.600]  and they wiped their ass with their hands. Now they've got more coal plants and more
[1:32:25.600 --> 1:32:30.720]  weapons than we do because they were set up to take us down by traitors that want to destroy
[1:32:30.720 --> 1:32:36.720]  America's destiny. I don't want to destroy China. I don't want to drive them to their
[1:32:36.720 --> 1:32:41.920]  death, but he does because he's a Satanist. He doesn't even know what the devil is. He
[1:32:41.920 --> 1:32:50.680]  was born of the devil. He was born without a soul. And the Chinese that have souls are
[1:32:50.680 --> 1:32:58.440]  under his rule. You think Bill Gates was born with a soul? No. These are of the fallen ones.
[1:32:58.440 --> 1:33:07.920]  Look at him. He says he wants to kill you, and you won't even speak out against him.
[1:33:07.920 --> 1:33:13.680]  The average trendy will tell you we love Xi Jinping. One of my oldest crew members,
[1:33:13.680 --> 1:33:22.120]  he's worked there 16 years. His sister worships. She's Anglo-Saxon. She worships Xi Jinping
[1:33:22.120 --> 1:33:27.360]  and says he will defeat Trump. This is main line of the Democrats. They love this. They
[1:33:27.360 --> 1:33:33.280]  love death camps. They love Tim Cook. They love people being murdered. They love harvesting
[1:33:33.280 --> 1:33:41.880]  organs. They love killing old people. They love it because they have a satanic energy.
[1:33:41.880 --> 1:33:49.800]  And it thrills them. They want to be under a little pig goblin. They want to be poor.
[1:33:49.800 --> 1:33:57.120]  They want to have nothing because they've lost their soul. Let's continue with the pig
[1:33:57.120 --> 1:34:08.680]  demon. He says if we have a Gorbachev, it will cause China to disintegrate. Nobody would
[1:34:08.680 --> 1:34:22.840]  be able. Back it up for me, please. As long as we go to work every day, we'll just start
[1:34:22.840 --> 1:34:30.480]  a war. As long as we go to work every day, we will drive the U.S. to its death. Continue.
[1:34:30.480 --> 1:34:41.960]  In any case, China's development cannot be resisted or stopped. As long as one thing
[1:34:41.960 --> 1:34:50.880]  doesn't happen, as long as we don't get a Gorbachev, we'll mess up China's own internal
[1:34:50.880 --> 1:35:00.000]  affairs and cause China to disintegrate. Nobody would be able to resist our development. As
[1:35:00.000 --> 1:35:09.080]  long as 1.4 billion Chinese people eat, sleep, defecate, and urinate every day. We'll drive
[1:35:09.080 --> 1:35:12.160]  America to its death. So that's the end. I wonder if I'm like, keep playing it. It's
[1:35:12.160 --> 1:35:18.880]  the end. All right. Sorry, crew. So I'm reading the CFR for 50 years saying China will overtake
[1:35:18.880 --> 1:35:24.360]  America, China will defeat America, and then set every trade deal to ship all our jobs,
[1:35:24.360 --> 1:35:28.600]  all our industry, and then pass laws where we can't have cheap power here so no one can
[1:35:28.600 --> 1:35:36.000]  compete or operate here. And then you go out to a pro-America event, a Christian event,
[1:35:36.000 --> 1:35:44.480]  and literally obese, soft, weird white people show up with China flags saying death to America
[1:35:44.480 --> 1:35:50.160]  every time. Usually, you'll see like some giant, another thing that's fat people, but
[1:35:50.160 --> 1:35:54.200]  just, you know, it's weird how they're like overfed. People are starving in China and
[1:35:54.200 --> 1:35:59.200]  in North Korea, and there'll be some dude in, we've seen the video in an actual early
[1:35:59.200 --> 1:36:06.160]  Chinese uniform, communist uniform from like the 40s, a revolutionary uniform with malpaches
[1:36:06.160 --> 1:36:12.840]  on it, pointing at me when I'm in an armored vehicle saying, we're going to kill you. And
[1:36:12.840 --> 1:36:19.920]  of course the chai comms think this person's a joke, but that's how pathetic and dishonorable
[1:36:19.920 --> 1:36:24.760]  they are and how ridiculous they are. They'd be in a forced labor camp having their organs
[1:36:24.760 --> 1:36:29.840]  harvested so fast in China. China totally disrespects them. The chai comms are working
[1:36:29.840 --> 1:36:36.720]  15, 16 hours a day in focused determination to annihilate America. Their entire will is
[1:36:36.720 --> 1:36:40.560]  on annihilating you because they're empty and they're scum and they're trash and they
[1:36:40.560 --> 1:36:45.280]  are a satanic energy and they believe they will only get relief when they have strangled
[1:36:45.280 --> 1:36:49.080]  us and annihilated us.
[1:36:49.080 --> 1:36:53.280]  Ladies and gentlemen, I hope we can stop the great reset. That means a globalist imposed
[1:36:53.280 --> 1:36:57.320]  worldwide depression to break us and bring us under their control. That's their stated
[1:36:57.320 --> 1:37:01.280]  admitted plan. Justin Trudeau's on record, Klaus Schwab, all the different Democrat
[1:37:01.280 --> 1:37:05.760]  mayors, they admit it's clowered in heaven, implode the economy to make us go under their
[1:37:05.760 --> 1:37:10.440]  control. But if we expose they're the ones doing it, they go to prison instead of getting
[1:37:10.440 --> 1:37:14.960]  total power and total control. And there are major uprisings happening across the world.
[1:37:14.960 --> 1:37:18.560]  You're in the U.S. Thousands of sheriffs are saying hell no to the lockdowns. People
[1:37:18.560 --> 1:37:23.200]  are finally starting to fight back. But regardless, you need to get prepared. We have high quality
[1:37:23.200 --> 1:37:28.960]  swarable food last 25 years, highest quality, lowest prices, great containers ready to ship.
[1:37:28.960 --> 1:37:32.920]  But when people figure this out in a few months, I think there'll be long lines again to get
[1:37:32.920 --> 1:37:36.800]  swarable food after the lockdown has been going for a few months. So get your orders

[1:37:48.480 --> 1:37:53.720]  There is an economic war taking place of the ruling class to consolidate power and control.
[1:37:53.720 --> 1:37:57.740]  There's a headline out from zero heads that breaks down Bloomberg numbers that global
[1:37:57.740 --> 1:38:04.200]  airlines are set to lose $157 billion this year by the end of December. It's already
[1:38:04.200 --> 1:38:11.480]  over $130 billion they've lost. Why would they take part in the hoax, in the lockdown,
[1:38:11.480 --> 1:38:15.640]  in the hysteria if it hurts them? We'll see. That'll knock out all the small airlines and
[1:38:15.640 --> 1:38:19.680]  consolidate control. It's the same in every single industry. And the big megabanks have
[1:38:19.680 --> 1:38:24.880]  unlimited capital. They want to bankrupt the world economy until they buy it up for pennies
[1:38:24.880 --> 1:38:28.920]  on the dollar. That's why the great stock market crash of 29 later turned out was engineered
[1:38:28.920 --> 1:38:34.400]  by some central banks. This is how the globalists take control. It stars the third world to
[1:38:34.400 --> 1:38:39.880]  death, makes the first world poor, its economic warfare, and it gives cover to the big megabanks
[1:38:39.880 --> 1:38:45.120]  that created thousands of trillions of dollars in fake derivatives. Only the truth will set
[1:38:45.120 --> 1:38:50.160]  us free in pullwars.com.
[1:38:50.160 --> 1:38:55.160]  Most of the world submitted to the unconstitutional criminal lockdowns directed by the communist
[1:38:55.160 --> 1:39:01.160]  Chinese and the United Nations. And now because the slaves have proven themselves to be subservient,
[1:39:01.160 --> 1:39:06.000]  the worst Australian models of complete lockdowns you can't even leave your house for months
[1:39:06.000 --> 1:39:11.200]  and months are being announced. And in Germany, the police are using giant armored tanks with
[1:39:11.200 --> 1:39:16.720]  water cannons to blast men, women, and children that protest the fact that Merkel, the dictator,
[1:39:16.720 --> 1:39:20.920]  has put them under her control. That's right, she's been rigging elections for years and
[1:39:20.920 --> 1:39:26.080]  years. And the same thing is coming here to the United States. This is world government.
[1:39:26.080 --> 1:39:30.840]  In Philadelphia, they've announced four people or more seen together will be arrested. They're
[1:39:30.840 --> 1:39:35.240]  announcing the Christmas is canceled. This is what the communist takeover looks like,
[1:39:35.240 --> 1:39:40.800]  to bankrupt you, to take rid of all your due process, and absolutely transform the world
[1:39:40.800 --> 1:39:46.720]  into a prison planet. How long have we warned you about this? But you can fight back. America
[1:39:46.720 --> 1:39:50.800]  is the last bastion. Stop submitting.

[1:39:59.600 --> 1:40:04.600]  It goes together very well with our body's ultimate tumeric formula that is taken as
[1:40:04.600 --> 1:40:10.200]  a powdered capsule and absorbed in the stomach and intestines. This is absorbed under the
[1:40:10.200 --> 1:40:14.680]  tongue into the bloodstream. And then the remaining also is then absorbed by the stomach.
[1:40:14.680 --> 1:40:19.360]  So it's more of an intense delivery system. The two formulas are different, but both are
[1:40:19.360 --> 1:40:23.440]  concentrates. And our first product got rave reviews. We've now been testing this out for

[1:40:52.520 --> 1:41:06.880]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[1:41:06.880 --> 1:41:13.320]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones coming to you live from the
[1:41:13.320 --> 1:41:20.800]  front lines of the info war. So Chuck Carlson and the rest of the media say, show us the
[1:41:20.800 --> 1:41:27.160]  proof of election fraud. Well, Trump's in filing suit in Georgia and Pennsylvania and
[1:41:27.160 --> 1:41:34.480]  Nevada and Arizona and Michigan, Wisconsin, Pennsylvania, Minnesota. And they've been
[1:41:34.480 --> 1:41:39.120]  trying to get to the files, trying to get to the thumb drives, trying to get to the
[1:41:39.120 --> 1:41:45.120]  raw data that they saw once they stopped the counting, but kept counting secretly going.
[1:41:45.120 --> 1:41:52.080]  What actually happened? Because any forensic expert, anybody with a common eye can look
[1:41:52.080 --> 1:41:59.200]  at the fraud in all those states where you've got Trump above Biden. It's a biological curve.
[1:41:59.200 --> 1:42:03.040]  He's just going up and down. And then magically it goes straight up. Once they close the polling
[1:42:03.040 --> 1:42:08.320]  places, once they quote, stop counting, magically it goes straight up for Biden until he gets
[1:42:08.320 --> 1:42:16.400]  up above Trump and then planes off with straight lines. And so Trump's been trying to get the
[1:42:16.400 --> 1:42:23.400]  raw data like, where's the data show it to us? Not against Carlson, but you know, that's
[1:42:23.400 --> 1:42:27.000]  what he's been doing. We're like, well, we're trying to get it. We can look at the numbers
[1:42:27.000 --> 1:42:33.160]  from the Secretary of State's offices and see that if you've got 700,000 more ballots
[1:42:33.160 --> 1:42:40.160]  that we're mailing, cast, then we're mailed out, there's a fraud. That means they're counterfeit.
[1:42:40.160 --> 1:42:48.040]  Show us the proof. It's right there. Well, get Daniels as a new article on infowars.com.
[1:42:48.040 --> 1:42:53.760]  Georgia government lawyers claim trade secrets to voting machines must be kept after the
[1:42:53.760 --> 1:43:00.160]  judge said, freeze the hard drives, freeze the data, freeze the memory sticks. And he
[1:43:00.160 --> 1:43:03.360]  said, oh, actually, don't they said, okay, go ahead and freeze it for 10 days. And now
[1:43:03.360 --> 1:43:10.080]  the lawyers are arguing stories on infowars.com. Get Daniels that, oh, you can't look at it.
[1:43:10.080 --> 1:43:15.280]  It's a trade secret. You can't look under the hood of that thing. You can't actually
[1:43:15.280 --> 1:43:20.240]  see where the votes came in or where they came out because it's the holy grail. It's
[1:43:20.240 --> 1:43:25.080]  the proof. They've got the forensic experts that will show the hack will show the patch.
[1:43:25.080 --> 1:43:30.120]  It'll show the fraud. It'll show the scam. It'll show all those Chinese ballots, ship
[1:43:30.120 --> 1:43:36.120]  it in, flown in on private jets, fed in that were all perfectly scantroned, perfectly printed,
[1:43:36.120 --> 1:43:40.640]  weren't even folded, were never put in an envelope, were never mailed. They were brought
[1:43:40.640 --> 1:43:47.480]  in. We even have the Chinese on video in Georgia and Michigan at 4am and 3am coming
[1:43:47.480 --> 1:43:58.160]  in with the dollies. Chinese nationals landing in private jets with perfect ballots hitting
[1:43:58.160 --> 1:44:08.960]  us and hitting us hard. They don't have elections in China. It's all the kids of the revolutionaries
[1:44:08.960 --> 1:44:13.600]  that murdered 100 million people in their own country that run things over there. They
[1:44:13.600 --> 1:44:19.240]  just hand the power down so they use our open election systems to game it. And we sit here
[1:44:19.240 --> 1:44:28.360]  and watch all these criminals just celebrate what they've done. I want to take some calls
[1:44:28.360 --> 1:44:32.000]  next hour about what you think President Trump should do, but he should just level the American
[1:44:32.000 --> 1:44:38.720]  people and point out this is a foreign takeover. Or we'll just be buffaloed by the corporate
[1:44:38.720 --> 1:44:42.440]  media that's censoring everybody and things will just get 100 times worse as Communist
[1:44:42.440 --> 1:44:46.520]  China said on their state run TV. We're never going to let America open. They're done. We
[1:44:46.520 --> 1:44:53.560]  will kill America. America will die. Death to America. America's over. You're like why
[1:44:53.560 --> 1:44:57.720]  the hell is that guy talking like that? That's what G.G. Ping says. They had an article a
[1:44:57.720 --> 1:45:03.120]  month ago in the L.A. Times about the new emperor of China was the headline and it said
[1:45:03.120 --> 1:45:07.680]  G.G. Ping believes he'll destroy America and overturn our republic and smash us and we
[1:45:07.680 --> 1:45:16.840]  believe he will and we support it. I mean they have already rolled over folks. All the
[1:45:16.840 --> 1:45:27.160]  king's horses, all the king's men have already rolled over and say we're done. Wow. And then
[1:45:27.160 --> 1:45:31.400]  you don't even get anything rolling over now. You'll be totally enslaved. But see there's
[1:45:31.400 --> 1:45:38.240]  something about a cuck. They like getting effed over. So I'm just here telling you how bad
[1:45:38.240 --> 1:45:42.120]  it is. Again Tim Cook runs death camps and it's on the news. It's like well it's okay.
[1:45:42.120 --> 1:45:46.240]  They run death camps. I mean you know. Those Christians deserve to be in those. It's like
[1:45:46.240 --> 1:45:52.320]  yeah. We're with the program here. There it is. Dreams of a red emperor. The relentless
[1:45:52.320 --> 1:46:00.040]  rise of G.G. Ping. That article literally has him quoted as he will destroy America.
[1:46:00.040 --> 1:46:09.680]  And the LA Times is like, let's just say they're very sexually excited over it. You're like
[1:46:09.680 --> 1:46:15.560]  why? Because it's a spirit they get. I mean you watch these shows about abortion, mainline
[1:46:15.560 --> 1:46:20.280]  shows and the women start rubbing their legs together and going oh god it turns me on.
[1:46:20.280 --> 1:46:27.600]  Oh god. Oh I killed my baby. I mean I played the clips. You haven't played them for again?
[1:46:27.600 --> 1:46:31.160]  I love bully and my little daughter. She was 8 months old. We waited until she got really
[1:46:31.160 --> 1:46:37.000]  big and then I went in there with my boyfriend while they chopped her up. It was so good.
[1:46:37.000 --> 1:46:42.440]  Did they play the clips for it? Clips where they're doing an abortion. The woman's going
[1:46:42.440 --> 1:46:50.960]  oh yeah. Turns out she was an actress. She wasn't even doing it. But other women then
[1:46:50.960 --> 1:46:57.320]  believe it's a fetish now. Sola scum. Because we spoiled our children. We didn't whip their
[1:46:57.320 --> 1:47:03.480]  ass. We didn't stand up. We let Hollywood pedophile satanist raise them through the TV. And now
[1:47:03.480 --> 1:47:09.800]  we've got generations of little spoiled mentally retarded satanist who actually think Gigi
[1:47:09.800 --> 1:47:16.760]  pings their daddy like a baby duck hatches out of the nest. And the first thing it sees
[1:47:16.760 --> 1:47:24.600]  a fire hydrant, a dog, an elephant, whatever it sees it imprints on. And our children by
[1:47:24.600 --> 1:47:34.520]  and large have imprinted on pedophilia and satanism and Gigi pain. It's true. We had
[1:47:34.520 --> 1:47:43.280]  too much money. We were too wealthy. We are in total crisis. By the way, if you're a new
[1:47:43.280 --> 1:47:49.000]  listener, I have a 5 minute to 10 minute clip of women saying they love killing their babies
[1:47:49.000 --> 1:47:55.680]  and it feels good sexually. Would you like me to play? It's human sacrifice. I mean you
[1:47:55.680 --> 1:48:00.120]  don't just think they want to screw your kids do you? No, no, no, no, no. That's metaphysical.
[1:48:00.120 --> 1:48:11.720]  They want to kill them. I'm not going to even say the other videos. I mean this is on HBO.
[1:48:11.720 --> 1:48:22.240]  And rolling around in baby parts. And who's the biggest exporter of it? Communist China
[1:48:22.240 --> 1:48:29.400]  of powdered baby that's sold into France and that women take so their skin looks younger.
[1:48:29.400 --> 1:48:37.840]  Well, I'm not selling powdered baby. I haven't plugged yet today. If we don't plug, we won't
[1:48:37.840 --> 1:48:43.480]  be here. If you want to keep us on air, I suggest you go to infowarstore.com and you buy the

[1:50:45.920 --> 1:50:49.320]  like, you know I take regular turmeric, it's like twice the dose, it doesn't really help
[1:50:49.320 --> 1:50:53.560]  me much, but why does this work so much better and it's a lower dose, and I said, because
[1:50:53.560 --> 1:50:57.840]  you just call it a food product, but it's really an extract, and so that's way stronger
[1:50:57.840 --> 1:51:02.040]  than the big horse pills you're taking of turmeric, because I was like, tell her to
[1:51:02.040 --> 1:51:04.600]  take turmeric, she's like, oh that doesn't really work for me, everybody says it does,
[1:51:04.600 --> 1:51:07.720]  it doesn't help me much, I have to take like 3 or 4 of these big ones to get an effect,
[1:51:07.720 --> 1:51:11.920]  I said just take one or two of these, she's like, what in the hell is going on, because
[1:51:11.920 --> 1:51:16.480]  it's concentrated turmeric, it's got some other known herbs that help accelerate it,
[1:51:16.480 --> 1:51:20.160]  I'm not the expert, I hire those people, but I really try to bring them as a product,
[1:51:20.160 --> 1:51:27.200]  bodies, ultimate turmeric formula, infowarstore.com, try DNA force with the PQQ and the CoQ10, infowarstore.com

[1:51:34.480 --> 1:51:45.440]  and others in studios stay with us.
[1:52:34.480 --> 1:53:04.320]  Family member or yourself at infowarstore.com.
[1:53:04.320 --> 1:53:34.160]  Family member or yourself at infowarstore.com or triple A, 2, 5, 3, 3, 1, 3, 2, 3, 1, 3,
[1:53:34.160 --> 1:53:44.120]  8 hours and 30 minutes.
[1:53:44.120 --> 1:54:00.960]  Family member or yourself at infowarstore.com or triple A, 2, 5, 3, 3, 1, 3, 1, 3, 1, 3,
[1:54:00.960 --> 1:54:06.280]  We got 74 million votes.
[1:54:06.280 --> 1:54:08.480]  He did not get anywhere near 80.
[1:54:08.480 --> 1:54:12.680]  And that's 74 before they throw away, you know, they threw away ballots.
[1:54:12.680 --> 1:54:14.800]  They threw away many Trump ballots.
[1:54:14.800 --> 1:54:16.560]  That's the easiest way they could cheat.
[1:54:16.560 --> 1:54:19.120]  But we got 74 million votes.
[1:54:19.120 --> 1:54:22.880]  He didn't get anywhere close to 80 million votes.
[1:54:22.880 --> 1:54:26.080]  And you believe you will be able to prove this in the coming weeks?
[1:54:26.080 --> 1:54:35.000]  Well, I'm going to use 125 percent of my energy to do it.
[1:54:35.000 --> 1:54:38.440]  You need a judge that's willing to hear a case.
[1:54:38.440 --> 1:54:44.720]  You need a Supreme Court that's willing to make a real big decision based on everything
[1:54:44.720 --> 1:54:47.840]  that it's not like you're going to change my mind.
[1:54:47.840 --> 1:54:52.720]  In other words, my mind will not change in six months.
[1:54:52.720 --> 1:54:54.760]  There was tremendous cheating here.
[1:54:54.760 --> 1:54:55.960]  Boxes were brought in.
[1:54:55.960 --> 1:54:58.320]  The mail-in vote is a disaster.
[1:54:58.320 --> 1:55:02.520]  And by the way, if Republicans allow it to happen, you'll never have another Republican
[1:55:02.520 --> 1:55:07.920]  elected in the history of this country at a Senate level or at a presidential level.
[1:55:07.920 --> 1:55:10.180]  You'll never, or at a House level.
[1:55:10.180 --> 1:55:13.400]  Mail-in voting is a total disaster.
[1:55:13.400 --> 1:55:17.120]  One thing that did happen, very interesting, we won all the state houses.
[1:55:17.120 --> 1:55:18.320]  We won Congress.
[1:55:18.320 --> 1:55:23.160]  Everything in Kevin McCarthy gives me a massive amount of credit for what happened.
[1:55:23.160 --> 1:55:25.120]  We were supposed to lose seats.
[1:55:25.120 --> 1:55:29.680]  We didn't lose one seat and we gained many and others were leading and others.
[1:55:29.680 --> 1:55:33.280]  And by the way, you know why the votes aren't in yet or like five or six others?
[1:55:33.280 --> 1:55:38.000]  Because the mail-in voting is all screwed up on congressional races.
[1:55:38.000 --> 1:55:41.000]  And we held the Senate, okay?
[1:55:41.000 --> 1:55:45.280]  And I'm the only one, they say it's statistically impossible.
[1:55:45.280 --> 1:55:46.840]  I led the charge.
[1:55:46.840 --> 1:55:48.000]  We won state houses.
[1:55:48.000 --> 1:55:49.000]  We won Congress.
[1:55:49.000 --> 1:55:50.720]  We won the Senate.
[1:55:50.720 --> 1:55:51.720]  And I lost.
[1:55:51.720 --> 1:55:56.800]  They say it's statistically impossible for that to happen.
[1:55:56.800 --> 1:55:59.120]  It's all quite extraordinary, Mr. President.
[1:55:59.120 --> 1:56:03.400]  We want to thank you so much for joining me today and thank you for your work on Operation
[1:56:03.400 --> 1:56:04.400]  Warp Speed.
[1:56:04.400 --> 1:56:08.280]  You told us we would have a vaccine by year-end and now we've got three.
[1:56:08.280 --> 1:56:09.280]  Thank you so much.
[1:56:09.280 --> 1:56:12.760]  You're actually very brave because you're doing something.
[1:56:12.760 --> 1:56:14.440]  The media doesn't want to talk about it.
[1:56:14.440 --> 1:56:17.040]  They know how fraudulent this is.
[1:56:17.040 --> 1:56:18.920]  It's no different than Hunter.
[1:56:18.920 --> 1:56:19.920]  It's no different than Hunter.
[1:56:19.920 --> 1:56:22.040]  They don't want to talk about Hunter.
[1:56:22.040 --> 1:56:26.400]  So they totally closed it off, big tech and the media, other than the New York Post, as
[1:56:26.400 --> 1:56:28.880]  you remember, which took a lot of heat.
[1:56:28.880 --> 1:56:29.880]  It was terminated.
[1:56:29.880 --> 1:56:34.760]  It was terminated from, I guess, Twitter, maybe Facebook.
[1:56:34.760 --> 1:56:40.660]  But it's a situation, the likes of which we don't have freedom of the press in this country.
[1:56:40.660 --> 1:56:42.280]  We have suppression by the press.
[1:56:42.280 --> 1:56:43.280]  They suppress.
[1:56:43.280 --> 1:56:46.960]  You know, you can't have a scandal if nobody reports about it.
[1:56:46.960 --> 1:56:52.720]  This is the greatest fraud in the history of our country from an electoral standpoint.
[1:56:52.720 --> 1:56:53.720]  You're right.
[1:56:53.720 --> 1:56:56.320]  And I think you could build it up bigger than an electoral standpoint.
[1:56:56.320 --> 1:56:57.320]  And the COVID...
[1:56:57.320 --> 1:57:00.640]  What's bigger from an electoral standpoint?
[1:57:00.640 --> 1:57:01.640]  What's bigger than this?
[1:57:01.640 --> 1:57:02.640]  This is...
[1:57:02.640 --> 1:57:05.840]  And the COVID is the smokescreen for all of it to happen.
[1:57:05.840 --> 1:57:12.040]  Well, Brian Stelter, that no one watches, but that Jeff Zucker believes is God, came
[1:57:12.040 --> 1:57:16.800]  out and attacked the lady for having Trump on, and he's supposed to have Trump on.
[1:57:16.800 --> 1:57:20.720]  And when you do that, you get criticized and called Alex Jones.
[1:57:20.720 --> 1:57:24.480]  Well, that's a badge of honor when the enemy CNN attacks me.
[1:57:24.480 --> 1:57:25.480]  I love it.
[1:57:25.480 --> 1:57:26.480]  Here it is.
[1:57:26.480 --> 1:57:28.200]  She's not being a journalist.
[1:57:28.200 --> 1:57:30.720]  She's being a propagandist, and that's what Fox News employs.
[1:57:30.720 --> 1:57:35.520]  You know, Brian, there will be outrage if Fox News hired someone like Infowars as Alex
[1:57:35.520 --> 1:57:38.720]  Jones to be anchoring a show on their network.
[1:57:38.720 --> 1:57:43.520]  Frankly, there is not much daylight between Maria and Alex Jones.
[1:57:43.520 --> 1:57:48.080]  She's accepting the same delusional conspiracy theories that the president is spinning, and
[1:57:48.080 --> 1:57:50.240]  she's actually encouraging him.
[1:57:50.240 --> 1:57:52.960]  She's acting shocked, like, wow, I couldn't believe that.
[1:57:52.960 --> 1:57:53.960]  Can you confirm this?
[1:57:53.960 --> 1:57:58.120]  And he spends another lie, and she acts shocked, and says, wow, well, you know, people don't
[1:57:58.120 --> 1:57:59.120]  believe the election results.
[1:57:59.120 --> 1:58:01.320]  Well, gee, I wonder why?
[1:58:01.320 --> 1:58:02.640]  This is so sad.
[1:58:02.640 --> 1:58:03.640]  It's really so sad.
[1:58:03.640 --> 1:58:07.360]  It's sad for the president who's about to leave office, and this is going to be the
[1:58:07.360 --> 1:58:09.360]  last chapter of his administration.
[1:58:09.360 --> 1:58:15.720]  And it's sad that a journalist like Bartiromo, who had a storied career, is now not a journalist
[1:58:15.720 --> 1:58:16.720]  at all.
[1:58:16.720 --> 1:58:21.920]  Because she's not joining all the parrots in mainstream corporate media that keep lying
[1:58:21.920 --> 1:58:25.240]  over and over and over and over again, saying there's no evidence of election fraud, when
[1:58:25.240 --> 1:58:26.840]  that's all there is.
[1:58:26.840 --> 1:58:33.680]  And now they don't want the servers and the voting machines looked at in Georgia, in Pennsylvania.
[1:58:33.680 --> 1:58:35.280]  They're saying, oh, it's proprietary.
[1:58:35.280 --> 1:58:40.640]  Our story's on infowars.com, and 700,000 more ballots got mailed in than were mailed
[1:58:40.640 --> 1:58:43.080]  out impossible in Georgia.
[1:58:43.080 --> 1:58:44.080]  Total fraud.
[1:58:44.080 --> 1:58:48.080]  They've been caught.
[1:58:48.080 --> 1:58:53.720]  Imagine a dystopic novel or a dystopic science fiction movie where if you've had a cold, it
[1:58:53.720 --> 1:58:58.600]  can be locked up in your home, you can be taken away, you can be forcibly inoculated
[1:58:58.600 --> 1:59:03.080]  with drugs that masquerade as vaccines that actually change your very DNA.
[1:59:03.080 --> 1:59:07.520]  Well, that's where you are in the year 2020, global government, the United Nations.
[1:59:07.520 --> 1:59:09.400]  All these authoritarian groups admit they're doing it.
[1:59:09.400 --> 1:59:15.320]  They even admit that they're doing it for power and control, and that they're not even
[1:59:15.320 --> 1:59:17.040]  worried about COVID-19.
[1:59:17.040 --> 1:59:19.440]  That's what Klaus Schwab and others have said.
[1:59:19.440 --> 1:59:22.640]  Think about how it's say that as, oh, a big tech's got to track you.
[1:59:22.640 --> 1:59:23.640]  They've got to trace you.
[1:59:23.640 --> 1:59:24.640]  They've got to control you.
[1:59:24.640 --> 1:59:26.440]  You've got to have apps to leave your house.
[1:59:26.440 --> 1:59:27.440]  Why?
[1:59:27.440 --> 1:59:31.880]  You've got to have secret police come disappear you because, my God, this thing has 110%
[1:59:31.880 --> 1:59:37.080]  chance of killing you, give your ability to cancer or heart attack.
[1:59:37.080 --> 1:59:38.560]  This is their takeover.
[1:59:38.560 --> 1:59:43.240]  Imagine on America's death certificate, killed by the fear of a common cold.
[1:59:43.240 --> 2:00:10.200]  What's happened in this country should never happen, and we are going through, no doubt
[2:00:10.200 --> 2:00:21.160]  my mind, we're going through a crucible of history, and if we don't correct what it
[2:00:21.160 --> 2:00:28.240]  is that's happening right now over the next couple of weeks, then I really hate to even
[2:00:28.240 --> 2:00:33.840]  think about what will happen in our country going forward into the latter part of December
[2:00:33.840 --> 2:00:36.800]  and certainly into the next month.
[2:00:36.800 --> 2:00:44.080]  I do not believe, I do not believe for a second that the country will accept Vice President
[2:00:44.080 --> 2:00:51.520]  Biden as the next president based on what we know to be probably the greatest fraud
[2:00:51.520 --> 2:00:56.240]  that our country has ever experienced in our history.
[2:00:56.240 --> 2:01:00.080]  I mean, what we're seeing, what I'm in right in the middle of it right now, and I will
[2:01:00.080 --> 2:01:06.240]  tell you that, first of all, the president has clear paths to victory.
[2:01:06.240 --> 2:01:11.520]  They have clear paths to victory, and they actually don't require a lot of courtroom
[2:01:11.520 --> 2:01:12.520]  action.
[2:01:12.520 --> 2:01:18.640]  What they require is they require a lot of honesty out of elected officials, and frankly
[2:01:18.640 --> 2:01:25.960]  a lot of Americans who are coming forward and telling us their stories, I mean the hundreds
[2:01:25.960 --> 2:01:32.640]  and hundreds of Americans around the country in different states, not just the swing states,
[2:01:32.640 --> 2:01:37.040]  but many, many other states that are coming forward with their stories and putting them
[2:01:37.040 --> 2:01:40.720]  down on affidavits as witnesses.
[2:01:40.720 --> 2:01:48.360]  We had probably 10 or 12 affidavits come in from one particular state today, and because
[2:01:48.360 --> 2:01:53.720]  there's been a number of threats to people, these particular patriots, they sent their
[2:01:53.720 --> 2:01:59.600]  photos in with their affidavits and said, put mine up at the top of the list because
[2:01:59.600 --> 2:02:05.400]  I want people to know that I'm not going to be afraid of these people that are threatening
[2:02:05.400 --> 2:02:08.360]  our country and our way of life.
[2:02:08.360 --> 2:02:16.200]  And so I say all that, and on one hand and the other hand, as I just described, we have
[2:02:16.200 --> 2:02:23.240]  clear, clear paths to victory for this president, and frankly, he's going to win Pennsylvania,
[2:02:23.240 --> 2:02:27.920]  he's going to win Arizona, he's going to win Georgia, he's going to win Nevada, he's
[2:02:27.920 --> 2:02:31.040]  going to win Michigan.
[2:02:31.040 --> 2:02:35.560]  And the other one that he's probably going to pull in is Wisconsin, too, because there's
[2:02:35.560 --> 2:02:44.760]  a discrepancy in Wisconsin of 130,000 vigilant ballots that they just found, they just discovered.
[2:02:44.760 --> 2:02:50.440]  So there's a lot of things happening, and to me, it's all positive.
[2:02:50.440 --> 2:02:55.480]  I was asked today on a scale of one to 10 who will be the next president, and I said
[2:02:55.480 --> 2:02:58.880]  10, it'll be Donald Trump, it'll be President Trump.
[2:02:58.880 --> 2:03:02.480]  There's no doubt in my mind, there's no doubt in my mind that he won this election hands
[2:03:02.480 --> 2:03:11.360]  down in a landslide, probably somewhere between 350 and 400 electoral college votes.
[2:03:11.360 --> 2:03:18.640]  What we have seen is over, and I know this, I mean, over the last probably two decades
[2:03:18.640 --> 2:03:23.880]  and probably longer, I could give you a little bit of a history lesson in that, but I won't.
[2:03:23.880 --> 2:03:31.240]  So over the last couple of decades, what we have seen is a complete shift in how fast
[2:03:31.240 --> 2:03:39.640]  I believe that Communist China, in their long-term plan, decided to sort of move up their plans
[2:03:39.640 --> 2:03:48.840]  to become the global superpower, sole global superpower on the planet, and their sort of
[2:03:48.840 --> 2:03:53.080]  plan was by about the middle of this century that we're in right now.
[2:03:53.080 --> 2:03:57.960]  And I believe when, during the last 2016 election, when they didn't get the candidate
[2:03:57.960 --> 2:04:05.040]  that they needed, and the kind of ideology that they saw America moving towards, they
[2:04:05.040 --> 2:04:07.640]  were not going to allow 2020 to happen.
[2:04:07.640 --> 2:04:18.080]  And so now what we have is this theft with mail-in ballots, the theft with this smart
[2:04:18.080 --> 2:04:24.200]  medic software and these Dominion systems, I mean, these are systems that are not owned
[2:04:24.200 --> 2:04:29.240]  by this country, they're not owned by this country, they're owned by other, they were
[2:04:29.240 --> 2:04:30.920]  introduced into this country.
[2:04:30.920 --> 2:04:38.360]  How can we have, how can we say, as the United States of America, how can we say that we
[2:04:38.360 --> 2:04:48.400]  accept a system that is not made in this country, and not even, in many cases the ballots aren't
[2:04:48.400 --> 2:04:55.240]  even tallyed in this country, how can we say that here in this country that we accept that?
[2:04:55.240 --> 2:05:03.360]  The one thing, and for you all, and for all your listeners, the one most precious thing
[2:05:03.360 --> 2:05:13.320]  that makes me the same as the wealthiest guy on the planet, or the poorest person in America,
[2:05:13.320 --> 2:05:19.560]  what makes us equal, what makes us equal is when we go in to a voting booth, and we close
[2:05:19.560 --> 2:05:26.720]  that curtain, or we go in there, and we lean over to vote, my vote matters the same as the
[2:05:26.720 --> 2:05:32.840]  guy who's the richest guy in America, it matters the exact same, that's where we are.
[2:05:32.840 --> 2:05:39.680]  That's just part of the detailed interview, General Flynn issues emergency message to
[2:05:39.680 --> 2:05:45.560]  America, President Trump has a clear path to victory, but he needs your help now, that
[2:05:45.560 --> 2:05:50.720]  video is at band.video when you hear the whole interview, and General McInerney then gets
[2:05:50.720 --> 2:05:55.640]  into what Flynn's been talking about, and the fact that reportedly these servers that
[2:05:55.640 --> 2:06:00.920]  Congressman Omer talked about two weeks ago, and others have broken down, being grabbed
[2:06:00.920 --> 2:06:07.080]  in Germany, there was reportedly a firefight, I mean this is how insane all of this is getting,
[2:06:07.080 --> 2:06:13.760]  and now Trump's very close to getting the server logs for the files in Georgia, where
[2:06:13.760 --> 2:06:21.560]  they got 700,000 ballots that didn't exist, they just made up, it's fraud, repeat, today's
[2:06:21.560 --> 2:06:28.320]  fun fraud fact, 1.8 million mail-in ballots were sent out in Pennsylvania, and 2.5 million
[2:06:28.320 --> 2:06:34.400]  mail-in ballots were returned, that's the real world.
[2:06:34.400 --> 2:06:38.600]  And now Tucker Carlson's gonna get what he wants, Trump's trying to get the server logs,
[2:06:38.600 --> 2:06:44.960]  and they're saying, oh sorry, a story's on infowars.com, it's proprietary, you can't
[2:06:44.960 --> 2:06:53.640]  see those logs, wow, wow, and they just have everybody else but a few foxes saying no evidence,
[2:06:53.640 --> 2:06:58.200]  no evidence, no evidence, no evidence, just trying to gaslight us, Trump cannot, and he
[2:06:58.200 --> 2:07:03.360]  should not, and he better not, concede, he should level now and attack the operatives
[2:07:03.360 --> 2:07:09.120]  and attack COVID and attack Gates and attack Fauci and attack Biden and attack them all.
[2:07:09.120 --> 2:07:13.400]  No one can censor him from the Resolute Desk, he must dam the torpedoes and go straight
[2:07:13.400 --> 2:07:23.880]  out of him, unbelievable, let's go to General McInerney, Sidney and the president, through
[2:07:23.880 --> 2:07:31.720]  I believe General Flynn, have got the crack in organization, the 305 military intelligence
[2:07:31.720 --> 2:07:40.480]  battalion working with them, because in all of this we have not seen any footprints of
[2:07:40.480 --> 2:07:49.200]  the DOJ of the FBI nor the CIA on the friendly side, it's been on the deep state side.
[2:07:49.200 --> 2:07:52.440]  Let me just stop you there, General, because you just said something very interesting,
[2:07:52.440 --> 2:07:58.560]  you just said that who has just opened up the crack in and then you just described what
[2:07:58.560 --> 2:08:04.440]  the crack in was, we all know the term because of Sidney Powell using it, but you just said
[2:08:04.440 --> 2:08:07.800]  what it is, can you back up on that?
[2:08:07.800 --> 2:08:15.280]  Yes, Sidney got the term crack in because that's the nickname of the 305th military intelligence
[2:08:15.280 --> 2:08:23.480]  battalion and that has been her source along with other sources that Mary and I know about
[2:08:23.480 --> 2:08:29.440]  but we don't want to talk about and so we're getting the different sources that are relaying
[2:08:29.440 --> 2:08:38.720]  this, but the important thing is they identify, now get this, they identify China, Iran and
[2:08:38.720 --> 2:08:46.960]  Russia as being involved in this and manipulating and manipulating the votes.
[2:08:46.960 --> 2:08:58.000]  In addition, the U.S. Army, the U.S. Special Forces Command seized a server farm in Frankfurt
[2:08:58.000 --> 2:09:06.640]  Germany because they were sending this data from those five states or six states through
[2:09:06.640 --> 2:09:12.240]  the Internet to Spain and then into Frankfurt Germany.
[2:09:12.240 --> 2:09:17.440]  All right, now all of that's confirmed minus the firefight stuff.
[2:09:17.440 --> 2:09:20.320]  All I know is China is openly involved.
[2:09:20.320 --> 2:09:26.520]  You have 700,000 ballots that didn't exist that just showed up without creases, not hand
[2:09:26.520 --> 2:09:29.080]  drawn in but all done by machine.
[2:09:29.080 --> 2:09:33.640]  We have the video of people buying the fake ballots similar to those from China and then
[2:09:33.640 --> 2:09:36.800]  we have had this two plus weeks ago.
[2:09:36.800 --> 2:09:41.080]  All the different Chinese government chartered airlines landing in the middle of the night
[2:09:41.080 --> 2:09:46.600]  in all key battleground states, then offloaded the ballots to take you in.
[2:09:46.600 --> 2:09:51.320]  It really is simple, the left are into being deviant and I don't mean sexually deviant,
[2:09:51.320 --> 2:09:53.320]  that goes to the territory.
[2:09:53.320 --> 2:09:58.320]  I'm talking about deviant against their ancestors, deviant against their own species, deviant
[2:09:58.320 --> 2:10:00.440]  against the order of nature.
[2:10:00.440 --> 2:10:04.360]  Even though that deviance is destructive and poisonous, they still do it because they want
[2:10:04.360 --> 2:10:05.360]  to play God.
[2:10:05.360 --> 2:10:07.680]  Everything they touch, they destroy.
[2:10:07.680 --> 2:10:12.080]  Their sacrament is aborting babies and then using their body parts.
[2:10:12.080 --> 2:10:16.120]  Their religion is not taking care of the old but euthanizing them.
[2:10:16.120 --> 2:10:20.400]  Their whole system is designed for the U.N. to keep their world countries in serious poverty
[2:10:20.400 --> 2:10:26.520]  and poor, ballooning populations than watching all that new fruit down the vine, to continually
[2:10:26.520 --> 2:10:29.960]  reproduce the same nightmares over and over and over again.
[2:10:29.960 --> 2:10:32.800]  They truly are the children of Satan, they are the children of the devil.
[2:10:32.800 --> 2:10:37.760]  And if you look at the slaves that serve the Biden and Kamala Harris, it really is manifested
[2:10:37.760 --> 2:10:39.680]  being a slave of Satan is not profitable.
[2:10:39.680 --> 2:10:41.520]  Sin is not profitable.
[2:10:41.520 --> 2:10:46.120]  I'm Alex Jones and this is the Info War.
[2:10:46.120 --> 2:10:48.800]  Ladies and gentlemen, I hope we can stop the great reset.
[2:10:48.800 --> 2:10:53.080]  That means a globalist, imposed, worldwide depression to break us and bring us under
[2:10:53.080 --> 2:10:54.080]  their control.
[2:10:54.080 --> 2:10:55.080]  That's the state-admitted plan.
[2:10:55.080 --> 2:10:59.720]  Justin Trudeau is on record, Klaus Schwab, all the different Democrat mayors, they admit
[2:10:59.720 --> 2:11:03.760]  it's clowered in heaven, implode the economy to make us go under their control.
[2:11:03.760 --> 2:11:07.820]  But if we expose that they're the ones doing it, they go to prison instead of getting total
[2:11:07.820 --> 2:11:09.320]  power and total control.
[2:11:09.320 --> 2:11:13.680]  And there are major uprisings happening across the world during the U.S., thousands of sheriffs
[2:11:13.680 --> 2:11:17.400]  are saying hell no to the lockdowns, people are finally starting to fight back.
[2:11:17.400 --> 2:11:19.600]  But regardless, you need to get prepared.
[2:11:19.600 --> 2:11:24.560]  We have high-quality, durable food, last 25 years, highest quality, lowest prices, great
[2:11:24.560 --> 2:11:26.040]  containers ready to ship.
[2:11:26.040 --> 2:11:29.960]  But when people figure this out in a few months, I think there'll be long lines again to get
[2:11:29.960 --> 2:11:32.800]  durable food after the lockdown has been going for a few months.
[2:11:32.800 --> 2:11:38.440]  So get your orders in today at PrepareWithAlex.com, you get an additional 10% off and they're
[2:11:38.440 --> 2:11:39.440]  ready to ship.
[2:11:39.440 --> 2:11:43.640]  The sale ends next Wednesday, or I guess that's December 2nd, so get your orders in
[2:11:43.640 --> 2:12:12.160]  now, PrepareWithAlex.com.
[2:12:12.160 --> 2:12:17.440]  You know, I was working on a big story this morning concerning Communist China and ownership
[2:12:17.440 --> 2:12:20.960]  of the big voting machine company that gets so much attention.
[2:12:20.960 --> 2:12:27.680]  I hired a private security firm to start digging into it a few weeks ago and tracking back
[2:12:27.680 --> 2:12:28.680]  the provenance of it.
[2:12:28.680 --> 2:12:35.040]  They confirmed the Communist Chinese own part of this supposed company.
[2:12:35.040 --> 2:12:40.240]  And I sent the info to Paul Watson, who was a little bit overwhelmed these days.
[2:12:40.240 --> 2:12:43.440]  But regardless, we'll be breaking that today or we'll be breaking that tomorrow.
[2:12:43.440 --> 2:12:47.800]  But it is very, very, very, very big news.
[2:12:47.800 --> 2:12:53.960]  And it's my greatest frustration that we have so much massive news breaking so quickly.
[2:12:53.960 --> 2:13:00.760]  And people have lived in this country quasi-free for so long, they don't know what's hit them.
[2:13:00.760 --> 2:13:03.480]  And that's what I'm trying to explain.
[2:13:03.480 --> 2:13:04.840]  This is an economic weapon.
[2:13:04.840 --> 2:13:07.800]  It's not tanks, it's not airplanes.
[2:13:07.800 --> 2:13:13.800]  But by the time you realize it's happening, it's too late.
[2:13:13.800 --> 2:13:20.280]  Enrique Tarrio, I invited him to Austin a few weeks ago.
[2:13:20.280 --> 2:13:22.360]  He called me this morning and said, hey, I'm in town.
[2:13:22.360 --> 2:13:24.560]  It's one of the leaders, the leader of the Proud Boys.
[2:13:24.560 --> 2:13:31.240]  So I thought we'd get him to pop in studio with us ahead of Cyril Solente taking over.
[2:13:31.240 --> 2:13:37.600]  But right now, let me just go ahead and lay out for you what's really all behind this.
[2:13:37.600 --> 2:13:45.000]  Because when you hear about Mao Zedong and you see big U.S. colleges and European colleges
[2:13:45.000 --> 2:13:54.960]  and the Davos Group and the UN promoting Maoism and people like Mike Tyson gets a tattoo of
[2:13:54.960 --> 2:14:01.960]  Mao on him, why is it so cool to worship Mao Zedong?
[2:14:01.960 --> 2:14:10.720]  Well, he was the nearly illiterate upper-class peasant, which means he was over a bunch
[2:14:10.720 --> 2:14:12.120]  of other really poor people.
[2:14:12.120 --> 2:14:19.480]  He was a spoiled brat, he didn't bathe, and he was really a horrible person.
[2:14:19.480 --> 2:14:25.720]  And he killed over 80 million of his own people.
[2:14:25.720 --> 2:14:28.800]  And the Chinese communists put him on house arrest the last few years of his life along
[2:14:28.800 --> 2:14:35.920]  with his evil wife, his fourth wife, and I read books on this guy.
[2:14:35.920 --> 2:14:43.560]  And he had the great leap forward and then the Cold Spill Revolution.
[2:14:43.560 --> 2:14:48.560]  And so when you hear about the great reset, this is the great leap forward to get rid
[2:14:48.560 --> 2:14:52.400]  of local businesses, get rid of farmers, get rid of local communities and bankrupt you.
[2:14:52.400 --> 2:14:53.400]  That's what it is.
[2:14:53.400 --> 2:14:57.000]  Here it is, the New York Times.
[2:14:57.000 --> 2:15:01.560]  The New York Times, the leech tweet calling Mao Zedong one of history's greatest revolutionary
[2:15:01.560 --> 2:15:02.560]  figures.
[2:15:02.560 --> 2:15:06.760]  Hell, if you search in Geneva, most of the articles are how great he was.
[2:15:06.760 --> 2:15:07.760]  Here's the great leap forward.
[2:15:07.760 --> 2:15:19.640]  You can go read about it even on Wikipedia from 58 to 62.
[2:15:19.640 --> 2:15:26.200]  Then it goes into how they launched the operation between 53 and 76 with the great leap forward.
[2:15:26.200 --> 2:15:31.080]  Then after that was the Cultural Revolution, getting all the kids to go spy on their parents
[2:15:31.080 --> 2:15:37.520]  later, beat them up and kill them like children of the corn.
[2:15:37.520 --> 2:15:41.360]  And boy, did David Rockefeller really like what they did.
[2:15:41.360 --> 2:15:49.720]  They had these things called flesh banquets where they would take those that hadn't fully
[2:15:49.720 --> 2:15:58.160]  submitted to the communists and putting children, beat their brains out and then put them in
[2:15:58.160 --> 2:16:01.200]  big cookpots.
[2:16:01.200 --> 2:16:02.440]  That's mainline news too.
[2:16:02.440 --> 2:16:04.720]  That's the left really likes that.
[2:16:04.720 --> 2:16:09.840]  To a soulless, overweight, leftist who can't even walk down the stairs, the idea of it
[2:16:09.840 --> 2:16:13.800]  ruling over flesh pots and death, that's even sexier than abortion.
[2:16:13.800 --> 2:16:16.720]  They just love the idea of the power.
[2:16:16.720 --> 2:16:17.720]  There it is.
[2:16:17.720 --> 2:16:22.360]  So China's Cultural Revolution maintained unspoken 50 years later, but there's the photos
[2:16:22.360 --> 2:16:30.120]  and the graphics and very sick people, the communists, and then the Cultural Revolution
[2:16:30.120 --> 2:16:37.480]  that came after that and all these articles from thought co-biography of Mao Zedong, father
[2:16:37.480 --> 2:16:41.120]  of modern China, how great he is and how wonderful he is.
[2:16:41.120 --> 2:16:46.240]  Here's David Rockefeller article 1973 from a China traveler.
[2:16:46.240 --> 2:16:51.600]  He wrote some other ones about Mao Zedong when he died in 1976, about how great he is
[2:16:51.600 --> 2:16:57.200]  and how the model that they carried out is what he wants for America, and he set up a
[2:16:57.200 --> 2:17:01.480]  system to take our jobs and our industry and make it one-sided where we couldn't compete
[2:17:01.480 --> 2:17:09.880]  and shipped it all to China to take advantage of the hundreds of millions of slaves.
[2:17:09.880 --> 2:17:15.240]  And that's what they've done now.
[2:17:15.240 --> 2:17:21.520]  And so when you hear about the Great Reset, that was all cooked up from the Rockefellers
[2:17:21.520 --> 2:17:29.360]  in their Operation Lot Step, and of course, event 201 with Bill Gates.
[2:17:29.360 --> 2:17:34.640]  And now, build back better, they're going to collapse things in their own words to rebuild
[2:17:34.640 --> 2:17:40.720]  the communist utopia that will, quote, save the earth.
[2:17:40.720 --> 2:17:52.960]  And really all it has to do with is total, absolute hegemonic power over everyone.
[2:17:52.960 --> 2:17:56.160]  And the people that tell you you shouldn't have a car or air conditioning like when Barack
[2:17:56.160 --> 2:18:04.320]  Obama went to Africa 10 years ago, they're the ones that have giant mansions, dozens
[2:18:04.320 --> 2:18:10.160]  of them apiece, jet airplanes, helicopters, all this money, and they're convincing the
[2:18:10.160 --> 2:18:17.640]  general public that it's cool for them to be poor, you'll own nothing, you'll rent
[2:18:17.640 --> 2:18:21.360]  everything, including clothes on your back, but everything will be free because you'll
[2:18:21.360 --> 2:18:23.640]  be a slave.
[2:18:23.640 --> 2:18:26.000]  The U.S. won't be the world superpower.
[2:18:26.000 --> 2:18:27.000]  Communist China will.
[2:18:27.000 --> 2:18:35.200]  Paul Schwab is saying all of this, and you won't die waiting for an organ donor because
[2:18:35.200 --> 2:18:37.160]  we'll create synthetic ones.
[2:18:37.160 --> 2:18:38.160]  Yeah, right.
[2:18:38.160 --> 2:18:44.200]  All the utopias of communism, you'll eat a lot less meat, though, it'll be an occasional
[2:18:44.200 --> 2:18:46.320]  treat.
[2:18:46.320 --> 2:18:51.040]  Just like that Rockefeller Foundation, Plantopoulos I played last week from 10 years ago or nine
[2:18:51.040 --> 2:18:56.040]  years ago, they show schoolchildren in the U.K. that the state decides where you go,
[2:18:56.040 --> 2:18:58.360]  the state decides what you do, how you live.
[2:18:58.360 --> 2:19:05.560]  This is a corporate revolution of the establishment, and the left are not rebels, they are establishment
[2:19:05.560 --> 2:19:10.440]  lapdog idiot followers that are victims that bought into the fraud.
[2:19:10.440 --> 2:19:15.520]  It'd be like if the farmer came in the chicken coop with 100 chickens to pick one to take
[2:19:15.520 --> 2:19:22.040]  it for slaughter, and one jumped up and pretended that it was in charge and came over and started
[2:19:22.040 --> 2:19:27.240]  pecking at the other chickens like it was the farmer, and the farmer just grabs it
[2:19:27.240 --> 2:19:34.640]  by the neck and rings its neck and then chops its head off and plucks it and butchers it.
[2:19:34.640 --> 2:19:40.280]  That's all you're doing as a leftist is pretending that it's for the earth and it's what you
[2:19:40.280 --> 2:19:43.040]  went to college for and you're part of the establishment.
[2:19:43.040 --> 2:19:47.640]  You went to the establishment, to the big college, funded by the billionaires, by the
[2:19:47.640 --> 2:19:48.640]  trillion dollar companies.
[2:19:48.640 --> 2:19:55.120]  You were set up the whole time and you won't say a word in your class about Tim Cook and
[2:19:55.120 --> 2:19:58.320]  millions of Buddhist Christians and Muslims and death camps.
[2:19:58.320 --> 2:20:06.160]  You won't say a word about Trump trying to have that man because you don't care.
[2:20:06.160 --> 2:20:10.160]  Because you're like rotting dead tree when the fire comes, you're going to burn down,
[2:20:10.160 --> 2:20:12.280]  you will not exist anymore.
[2:20:12.280 --> 2:20:16.040]  You are the schmuck, you are the fool, you are the idiot.
[2:20:16.040 --> 2:20:24.120]  But those of us that are awake, we are cursed with reality and cursed with having the blinders
[2:20:24.120 --> 2:20:30.640]  off but really it's a blessing in the end but make no mistake, every month they continue
[2:20:30.640 --> 2:20:36.440]  the global lockdown is more third world collapse and more death and a bigger depression.
[2:20:36.440 --> 2:20:44.240]  So remember who did this to you, the globalists, the new world order, the chikops, the UN.
[2:20:44.240 --> 2:20:49.480]  You can't have Thanksgiving, you can't have Christmas, you can't go see your grandma
[2:20:49.480 --> 2:20:53.040]  in the nursing home but we can bring somebody in that has COVID and put them in the same
[2:20:53.040 --> 2:20:54.040]  room to kill her.
[2:20:54.040 --> 2:20:58.320]  And these people are waging war against logic, they're waging war against common sense, they're
[2:20:58.320 --> 2:21:02.320]  announcing now that the left thinks that Biden actually won the election, that record
[2:21:02.320 --> 2:21:06.080]  numbers of illegals are pouring across, they get all the free stuff and Biden says I'll
[2:21:06.080 --> 2:21:09.440]  make you citizens, I'll let you vote, I'll give everything free.
[2:21:09.440 --> 2:21:14.280]  This is a plan to take us down, it's a globalist plan but again the borders stay wide open
[2:21:14.280 --> 2:21:18.400]  and millions die of TV every year, that's a real disease but that's okay but you just
[2:21:18.400 --> 2:21:20.920]  can't go see your grandma or you can't go to Thanksgiving.
[2:21:20.920 --> 2:21:25.800]  Stop complying with the fraud, it's a great reset, it's a criminal takeover, I know you
[2:21:25.800 --> 2:21:30.120]  as an audience know this, tell everyone you know at Thanksgiving, tell them the truth
[2:21:30.120 --> 2:21:33.800]  so they understand what they're facing, compliance is death.
[2:21:33.800 --> 2:21:38.920]  This is economic war, this is mass genocide and we're fighting it hard at band.video,

[2:22:42.160 --> 2:22:43.160]  now.
[2:22:43.160 --> 2:22:50.400]  The great reset, where have I heard of that before, oh the great leap forward, Mao Zedong
[2:22:50.400 --> 2:22:55.000]  ordering all the small towns and small farms to basically shut down and have the rural
[2:22:55.000 --> 2:22:59.200]  people and the small business people move into the big cities and go under communist
[2:22:59.200 --> 2:23:03.760]  commune control and that's all this is, the big mega banks want to break us to the same
[2:23:03.760 --> 2:23:07.480]  ones that put Mao Zedong into power and they're creating the process of getting rid of our
[2:23:07.480 --> 2:23:11.840]  old economy and bringing in the new economy where everything's free because when you're
[2:23:11.840 --> 2:23:17.360]  a prisoner, well everything's free but you're also a slave, Scotland is going to have universal
[2:23:17.360 --> 2:23:21.840]  guaranteed incomes now of subsistence level but of course you've got to take those vaccines,
[2:23:21.840 --> 2:23:27.240]  you can't have any kids and oh don't worry though, all of the tampons and stuff like
[2:23:27.240 --> 2:23:30.240]  that's free too as well, I'm not kidding.
[2:23:30.240 --> 2:23:34.000]  So give me some free paper, give me enough money to basically live in a tiny apartment
[2:23:34.000 --> 2:23:38.040]  but they own you, they control you, that's the great reset, that's why it's got to be
[2:23:38.040 --> 2:23:47.240]  resisted to total takeover and we're fighting it at infowars.com.
[2:23:47.240 --> 2:24:13.240]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[2:24:13.240 --> 2:24:34.400]  Well, the proud boys, you got me, great folks at a great job, we were in DC a few weeks
[2:24:34.400 --> 2:24:38.880]  ago, over a half million people there but I read Antifa funded by the leftist Nazi
[2:24:38.880 --> 2:24:45.280]  George Soros, they said we're not allowed in DC, we're also scared, well guess what,
[2:24:45.280 --> 2:24:49.680]  I was thinking about not going on the 12th, I'm 100% going now, this is a more important
[2:24:49.680 --> 2:24:53.000]  rally than ever to show we don't buy the fake election, to show we don't buy the Chai
[2:24:53.000 --> 2:24:58.720]  Com agent Joe Biden, so everyone get to DC on the 12th, it was incredible last time,
[2:24:58.720 --> 2:25:03.840]  we had close to a million, let's get five times that, everyone must go, don't count
[2:25:03.840 --> 2:25:07.080]  on others, we have only begun to stand up.
[2:25:07.080 --> 2:25:11.240]  And it's funny that they say that because they said that last time they said they weren't
[2:25:11.240 --> 2:25:15.400]  going to allow any Trumpers in DC or no proud boys, and I think the turnout for this one
[2:25:15.400 --> 2:25:19.560]  is going to be a lot bigger, there's definitely a lot more proud boys that are coming, I see
[2:25:19.560 --> 2:25:20.560]  a lot more.
[2:25:20.560 --> 2:25:22.920]  We only planned this over a week last time.
[2:25:22.920 --> 2:25:25.800]  And now we have, what is it, like two, three weeks for this one?
[2:25:25.800 --> 2:25:29.240]  Well, it started with about two and a half weeks, but yeah, now it's 12 days.
[2:25:29.240 --> 2:25:32.920]  And I think we need to continue to do this, as a matter of fact, and not stop just all
[2:25:32.920 --> 2:25:36.320]  I agree, if they try to actually install that Communist Chinese agent, we're going to be
[2:25:36.320 --> 2:25:38.400]  up there on the 20th of January, baby.
[2:25:38.400 --> 2:25:39.400]  I think so.
[2:25:39.400 --> 2:25:43.880]  I think they're going to have a virtual inauguration, no, we're going to have the inauguration
[2:25:43.880 --> 2:25:45.920]  of 1776 commencing again.
[2:25:45.920 --> 2:25:52.320]  Now can you imagine a sea of red hats and Trump flags on DC, if they manage to steal
[2:25:52.320 --> 2:25:56.040]  this election, which I don't think that they will, I think the president has a really
[2:25:56.040 --> 2:26:02.200]  good chance of clearing out all the BS that's been happening in the States, specifically
[2:26:02.200 --> 2:26:04.560]  in Georgia as we're talking right now.
[2:26:04.560 --> 2:26:09.080]  There's an event going on in Georgia, and I think, I think he'll be able to pull through.
[2:26:09.080 --> 2:26:12.400]  But if not, we're going to be in DC on the 20th.
[2:26:12.400 --> 2:26:13.640]  We're going to fill it with red hats.
[2:26:13.640 --> 2:26:19.160]  We're going to fill it with MAGA hats, Trump flags, Proud Boys, Trump supporters, all types
[2:26:19.160 --> 2:26:22.000]  of patriots, your info warriors are going to come.
[2:26:22.000 --> 2:26:25.160]  I know you guys had a big crowd show up.
[2:26:25.160 --> 2:26:29.840]  So what I'll tell you what's crazy is that I want to slid all the folks that did show
[2:26:29.840 --> 2:26:30.840]  up there.
[2:26:30.840 --> 2:26:34.040]  Tell everybody you know to come again and tell them to tell people to come again.
[2:26:34.040 --> 2:26:36.200]  That's how we override big tech censorship.
[2:26:36.200 --> 2:26:40.240]  Despite all their censorship, we still had an event, you know, a hundred, a thousand
[2:26:40.240 --> 2:26:43.800]  times bigger than anything Joe Biden ever imagined.
[2:26:43.800 --> 2:26:45.920]  And so that's why we're there.
[2:26:45.920 --> 2:26:46.920]  But guess what?
[2:26:46.920 --> 2:26:47.920]  They certified Georgia.
[2:26:47.920 --> 2:26:48.920]  It doesn't mean anything.
[2:26:48.920 --> 2:26:52.280]  It means it just goes to the courts now while they were having a congressional legislative
[2:26:52.280 --> 2:26:55.200]  hearing presenting massive evidence of fraud.
[2:26:55.200 --> 2:27:00.120]  And now the Georgia judge has again ordered them to keep the data tapes and keep all the
[2:27:00.120 --> 2:27:01.800]  stuff, the proof of the fraud.
[2:27:01.800 --> 2:27:04.960]  So now they're announcing and now they're declaring.
[2:27:04.960 --> 2:27:08.680]  And now they're saying that, oh, that's proprietary.
[2:27:08.680 --> 2:27:09.680]  That's trademarked.
[2:27:09.680 --> 2:27:10.840]  That's secret science.
[2:27:10.840 --> 2:27:15.920]  You can't look at what we do in the black box with this Venezuelan Chinese communist
[2:27:15.920 --> 2:27:17.920]  company.
[2:27:17.920 --> 2:27:24.080]  Nothing, nothing in our election process should be a secret period from the machines to our
[2:27:24.080 --> 2:27:28.960]  balance to the way that our ballots are counted.
[2:27:28.960 --> 2:27:29.960]  Nothing should be a secret.
[2:27:29.960 --> 2:27:34.480]  We should be able to see everything transparency, spoken like a right wing fascist.
[2:27:34.480 --> 2:27:41.200]  I was going to say amen, but no, but yeah, we definitely need, there's blockchain technologies
[2:27:41.200 --> 2:27:43.720]  right now where we can use to track ballots.
[2:27:43.720 --> 2:27:45.120]  I mean, I could track a package.
[2:27:45.120 --> 2:27:47.040]  I can order food off my phone.
[2:27:47.040 --> 2:27:53.320]  I can order a flight, a taxi anywhere, but we can't figure out how this, where our ballots
[2:27:53.320 --> 2:27:54.320]  went.
[2:27:54.320 --> 2:27:57.080]  And the Democrats admit they want illegal aliens voting now that they are in many states
[2:27:57.080 --> 2:27:58.600]  letting them vote in local elections.
[2:27:58.600 --> 2:28:01.880]  So yeah, this is, have you heard now?
[2:28:01.880 --> 2:28:07.160]  They had 700,000 more ballots than were printed and mailed out in Georgia.
[2:28:07.160 --> 2:28:08.160]  That's confirmed.
[2:28:08.160 --> 2:28:09.160]  I saw that.
[2:28:09.160 --> 2:28:10.160]  I mean, this is like, where's the proof?
[2:28:10.160 --> 2:28:11.160]  My God.
[2:28:11.160 --> 2:28:13.880]  But see Tucker Carlson, I like Tucker, but I keep saying, show me the forensics.
[2:28:13.880 --> 2:28:15.600]  They won't give over the damn computers.
[2:28:15.600 --> 2:28:19.280]  Trump's been fighting for three weeks in the damn courts.
[2:28:19.280 --> 2:28:21.000]  And he's going to continue to fight.
[2:28:21.000 --> 2:28:22.520]  And we need to continue to fight.
[2:28:22.520 --> 2:28:30.080]  There's that what's, what's going on in Georgia is just we're getting to see all these other
[2:28:30.080 --> 2:28:34.280]  states like Wisconsin, 90% turnout rate.
[2:28:34.280 --> 2:28:38.600]  But just what you said right now about Georgia, they have more ballots than they printed out.
[2:28:38.600 --> 2:28:40.520]  How does that happen?
[2:28:40.520 --> 2:28:41.520]  That's why we're winning.
[2:28:41.520 --> 2:28:44.960]  That's why we're winning a lot of these court cases.
[2:28:44.960 --> 2:28:48.240]  Lynn Woods doing an amazing job.
[2:28:48.240 --> 2:28:51.960]  But I think, I think we definitely need to keep fighting and we need to keep supporting
[2:28:51.960 --> 2:28:53.640]  and we can't stop.
[2:28:53.640 --> 2:28:57.480]  We can't stop going out there because the moment they need that energy, they need that,
[2:28:57.480 --> 2:28:58.480]  they need us to be down.
[2:28:58.480 --> 2:28:59.920]  They need us to be on the couch.
[2:28:59.920 --> 2:29:03.160]  They need us to be silent and we're not silent.
[2:29:03.160 --> 2:29:04.320]  I'm here.
[2:29:04.320 --> 2:29:05.320]  I've been in Georgia.
[2:29:05.320 --> 2:29:12.280]  I've been in DC, PA, California, and I'm going to continue to do so.
[2:29:12.280 --> 2:29:16.320]  I love how Antifa was like, they knew what hotel I was staying in.
[2:29:16.320 --> 2:29:19.480]  So they were throwing mortars at the door.
[2:29:19.480 --> 2:29:22.400]  Like if they didn't do stuff like that, I wouldn't be coming to DC.
[2:29:22.400 --> 2:29:23.760]  Now I have to come.
[2:29:23.760 --> 2:29:25.440]  Now everybody has to come.
[2:29:25.440 --> 2:29:29.840]  We cleared them out in front of that hotel like three times and the cops didn't do anything.
[2:29:29.840 --> 2:29:30.840]  The cops sat there.
[2:29:30.840 --> 2:29:31.840]  I saw them in their riot gear.
[2:29:31.840 --> 2:29:35.600]  They were sitting in the middle of the plaza and the Proud Boys were the ones that had
[2:29:35.600 --> 2:29:36.600]  to clear them out of there.
[2:29:36.600 --> 2:29:37.600]  I don't know if you saw that.
[2:29:37.600 --> 2:29:38.600]  Oh, I've seen the footage, yeah.
[2:29:38.600 --> 2:29:42.440]  We cleared them out and then we got in front of the hotel and we started singing the National
[2:29:42.440 --> 2:29:43.440]  Anthem.
[2:29:43.440 --> 2:29:44.440]  At a big party.
[2:29:44.440 --> 2:29:45.440]  Yeah, we had a big party.
[2:29:45.440 --> 2:29:46.440]  Owen came out.
[2:29:46.440 --> 2:29:50.800]  We got these commie globalist Soros Nazi thugs deter you from coming to DC.
[2:29:50.800 --> 2:29:52.480]  We outnumbered them hundreds to one.
[2:29:52.480 --> 2:29:57.080]  Yes, if you're wearing a MAGA hat and you're a woman particularly or you're in a wheelchair,
[2:29:57.080 --> 2:30:00.440]  that's where they attack wolves always attack those they think are weak.
[2:30:00.440 --> 2:30:02.800]  You should not be alone out there at night.
[2:30:02.800 --> 2:30:05.120]  That's literally when they attack like vampires.
[2:30:05.120 --> 2:30:06.120]  But that's it.
[2:30:06.120 --> 2:30:07.120]  That's it.
[2:30:07.120 --> 2:30:08.760]  And that's that's that's what we did.
[2:30:08.760 --> 2:30:11.040]  We saw we were actually back in our hotel rooms.
[2:30:11.040 --> 2:30:14.000]  We're ready to relax and we ended up.
[2:30:14.000 --> 2:30:17.720]  We ended up getting a call like at six o'clock at night that there were assaulting women
[2:30:17.720 --> 2:30:18.720]  and children.
[2:30:18.720 --> 2:30:24.080]  They had some prod boys stuck inside a convenience store, throwing fireworks inside and our guys
[2:30:24.080 --> 2:30:29.040]  went out and we cleaned up those streets and the footage that we're showing is not a DC.
[2:30:29.040 --> 2:30:34.200]  The footage of DC, they're like, they like attack and they squeal and yell like babies
[2:30:34.200 --> 2:30:35.600]  when they're getting their asses beat.
[2:30:35.600 --> 2:30:37.800]  I didn't know men could make noises like that.
[2:30:37.800 --> 2:30:43.880]  No, you were I mean, you were there.
[2:30:43.880 --> 2:30:46.680]  What the hell's up with that?
[2:30:46.680 --> 2:30:47.680]  I don't know.
[2:30:47.680 --> 2:30:48.680]  But they've been doing this.
[2:30:48.680 --> 2:30:49.680]  It's not a surprise to us.
[2:30:49.680 --> 2:30:50.680]  They've been doing this since 2016.
[2:30:50.680 --> 2:30:56.720]  They've been yelling at the sky so much so that even like now their establishment is
[2:30:56.720 --> 2:30:58.560]  trying to steal an election.
[2:30:58.560 --> 2:31:01.720]  This is this is a referendum on the 2016 election.
[2:31:01.720 --> 2:31:04.040]  That's that's that's where all of this comes from.
[2:31:04.040 --> 2:31:06.600]  They cannot drop that a huge landslide on the number show it.
[2:31:06.600 --> 2:31:09.280]  That's why they're got 11 million votes more than he got last time.
[2:31:09.280 --> 2:31:13.120]  That's why they're in such a panic to just have this hoax and say Joe Biden who can't
[2:31:13.120 --> 2:31:15.840]  even walk now supposedly got elected.
[2:31:15.840 --> 2:31:19.120]  Do you see his tweet that said get well soon?
[2:31:19.120 --> 2:31:20.120]  The president's tweet?
[2:31:20.120 --> 2:31:21.120]  No.
[2:31:21.120 --> 2:31:22.120]  Yeah.
[2:31:22.120 --> 2:31:26.760]  He had a it's Joe Biden coming out of I guess the orthopedic or whatever and he tweeted
[2:31:26.760 --> 2:31:27.760]  get well soon.
[2:31:27.760 --> 2:31:31.320]  I mean, we have to have this guy for another four years.
[2:31:31.320 --> 2:31:36.720]  It's impossible that that we're a lot of us are so so I'll say this though.
[2:31:36.720 --> 2:31:38.640]  He couldn't get the Justice Department to do anything.
[2:31:38.640 --> 2:31:40.040]  They've engaged in such fraud.
[2:31:40.040 --> 2:31:42.480]  Of course they escalated up more fraud.
[2:31:42.480 --> 2:31:43.480]  And they've been caught doing it.
[2:31:43.480 --> 2:31:47.120]  So I mean, what happens if Joe Biden gets in my God?
[2:31:47.120 --> 2:31:50.280]  I'll tell you day one.
[2:31:50.280 --> 2:31:52.840]  We're looking at AR bands, right?
[2:31:52.840 --> 2:31:59.840]  We're looking at prison for people like yourself and the Proud Boys.
[2:31:59.840 --> 2:32:00.840]  Social media censorship.
[2:32:00.840 --> 2:32:06.760]  We've been screaming about social media censorship for the past four years and well, that's where
[2:32:06.760 --> 2:32:07.760]  Trump dropped the ball.
[2:32:07.760 --> 2:32:09.640]  Now he says it's a national security threat.
[2:32:09.640 --> 2:32:10.640]  Hardly agree.
[2:32:10.640 --> 2:32:12.640]  But here's what I'm going to talk about.
[2:32:12.640 --> 2:32:13.640]  What's about this tomorrow?
[2:32:13.640 --> 2:32:16.680]  What should Trump do with 51 days left regardless?
[2:32:16.680 --> 2:32:19.160]  He should be out exposing COVID as an overblown hoax.
[2:32:19.160 --> 2:32:20.960]  He should be exposing communist China.
[2:32:20.960 --> 2:32:22.760]  He should be exposing China Joe.
[2:32:22.760 --> 2:32:27.120]  He should be savaging them with the bully pulpit he's got about Hunter's laptop and
[2:32:27.120 --> 2:32:28.120]  all this now.
[2:32:28.120 --> 2:32:29.120]  Yeah.
[2:32:29.120 --> 2:32:33.120]  I think he should spend that time doing three things.
[2:32:33.120 --> 2:32:40.400]  Coming out with us, right, rallying the troops to his legal arguments and three, he should
[2:32:40.400 --> 2:32:41.680]  have a stack.
[2:32:41.680 --> 2:32:43.480]  Exactly how you have it right there, Alex.
[2:32:43.480 --> 2:32:48.000]  You should have a stack of executive orders, EOS to combat most of this.
[2:32:48.000 --> 2:32:52.080]  That's going to happen or that will happen if Joe Biden gets elected.
[2:32:52.080 --> 2:32:56.000]  He needs to be signing those and he's going to need a lot of Pence.
[2:32:56.000 --> 2:33:01.080]  I totally agree and just like Obama put stay behind networks and Trump can put in networks
[2:33:01.080 --> 2:33:02.560]  and people to block what's going on.
[2:33:02.560 --> 2:33:04.400]  I mean, because here's the deal.
[2:33:04.400 --> 2:33:07.800]  If Biden can weasel his way in, he admits endless lockdown.
[2:33:07.800 --> 2:33:12.080]  He wants to bring us to our knees with a great reset, just like they did in Cuba or anywhere
[2:33:12.080 --> 2:33:13.080]  else.
[2:33:13.080 --> 2:33:14.080]  And people need to know they're about to get reeducated.
[2:33:14.080 --> 2:33:18.040]  Well, my family found out firsthand how that works.
[2:33:18.040 --> 2:33:23.680]  The revolutionary forces, they promised like this free land and he even said it Castro
[2:33:23.680 --> 2:33:27.360]  even said it Castro was like, Oh, this isn't a Marxist revolution.
[2:33:27.360 --> 2:33:28.760]  This isn't a communist revolution.
[2:33:28.760 --> 2:33:31.000]  This is for the people.
[2:33:31.000 --> 2:33:32.920]  And it wasn't it.
[2:33:32.920 --> 2:33:35.080]  It turned into a hell.
[2:33:35.080 --> 2:33:39.640]  Let's talk about that experience in Cuba when we come back with the head of the probabilities
[2:33:39.640 --> 2:33:43.040]  on all shows.
[2:33:43.040 --> 2:33:48.040]  You know, listeners call into the show when they thank me and it makes me feel pathetic
[2:33:48.040 --> 2:33:54.280]  because I sit there and I beg you for support constantly for prayer, for financial support
[2:33:54.280 --> 2:33:55.280]  and for word of mouth.
[2:33:55.280 --> 2:33:59.320]  And we're all this together and I, you know, it gets old having to come to you and say,
[2:33:59.320 --> 2:34:02.240]  Hey, I got great products, please buy them or we won't be here on air.
[2:34:02.240 --> 2:34:03.240]  But it's true.
[2:34:03.240 --> 2:34:06.960]  It's the only media organization in the United States that promotes liberty at this level
[2:34:06.960 --> 2:34:10.960]  that is not beholden to big corporate sponsors and they've harassed and almost shut down
[2:34:10.960 --> 2:34:11.960]  everybody else.
[2:34:11.960 --> 2:34:14.120]  They crippled all the other groups and we're still here.
[2:34:14.120 --> 2:34:18.800]  And as this whole new world order comes out and the open, our credibility is going up.
[2:34:18.800 --> 2:34:20.360]  That's why we've got to be taken off here.
[2:34:20.360 --> 2:34:22.440]  That's why America has got to be taken down.
[2:34:22.440 --> 2:34:26.840]  You can't have all these other nations enslaved and America still quasi free.
[2:34:26.840 --> 2:34:30.760]  You can't have info wars has been proven right being on air with all the craziness that's
[2:34:30.760 --> 2:34:31.760]  about to unfold.
[2:34:31.760 --> 2:34:34.040]  Cause if you think stuff's bad now, just get ready.
[2:34:34.040 --> 2:34:39.120]  So thank you all and get an info wars.com, get some great 2020 election shirts, supplements
[2:34:39.120 --> 2:34:40.120]  and so much more.
[2:34:40.120 --> 2:34:41.120]  They're wonderful products.
[2:34:41.120 --> 2:34:42.120]  Yeah.
[2:34:42.120 --> 2:34:43.120]  They support the info.
[2:34:43.120 --> 2:34:44.120]  We're thank you.
[2:34:44.120 --> 2:34:45.120]  Remember Hillary Clinton.
[2:34:45.120 --> 2:34:46.120]  Remember Pelosi.
[2:34:46.120 --> 2:34:47.120]  Remember Bill Clinton.
[2:34:47.120 --> 2:34:48.120]  Remember Obama.
[2:34:48.120 --> 2:34:51.840]  All of them said we are not going to concede if there's a red mirage.
[2:34:51.840 --> 2:34:54.120]  We believe it's going to look like Trump's going to win in landslides.
[2:34:54.120 --> 2:34:59.080]  They have the internal polls and indeed Trump won most of the states he won last time by
[2:34:59.080 --> 2:35:04.160]  an even bigger margin and when he was set to win the other ones, they froze the seven
[2:35:04.160 --> 2:35:09.680]  states on election night and then they brought in all of the reserve ballots they had.
[2:35:09.680 --> 2:35:10.680]  This is completely transparent.
[2:35:10.680 --> 2:35:13.760]  So when they say that he is president elect, he's not.
[2:35:13.760 --> 2:35:14.760]  Trump has not conceded.
[2:35:14.760 --> 2:35:17.960]  None of the states have certified the vote and now all these investigations have been
[2:35:17.960 --> 2:35:23.200]  opened up and avalanches, mountains, oceans of election fraud has come out and already
[2:35:23.200 --> 2:35:26.160]  been documented in Georgia.
[2:35:26.160 --> 2:35:28.320]  Officials are on record saying we've already found fraud.
[2:35:28.320 --> 2:35:30.600]  But ladies and gentlemen, the fix is in.
[2:35:30.600 --> 2:35:34.560]  They've run bigger and bigger hoaxes every time because the last hoax failed.
[2:35:34.560 --> 2:35:38.040]  But now this is the mother of all hoaxes and if they get away with this, it's the end
[2:35:38.040 --> 2:35:39.040]  of America as we know it.
[2:35:39.040 --> 2:35:41.040]  We will be Venezuela.
[2:35:41.040 --> 2:35:43.680]  Infowars.com.
[2:35:43.680 --> 2:35:49.760]  Back in 1996, the head of the World Food Program said that they would use food and
[2:35:49.760 --> 2:35:55.120]  global lockdowns due to a virus year to bring in world government.
[2:35:55.120 --> 2:35:59.320]  That also came out in the North American Union Documents, the Judicial Watch, and Lou Dobbs
[2:35:59.320 --> 2:36:01.960]  got more than 15 years ago as well.
[2:36:01.960 --> 2:36:05.240]  So we know they're playing and if they're able to keep this lockdown going, it's going
[2:36:05.240 --> 2:36:10.040]  to cause not just a worldwide depression, but mass starvation of hundreds of millions.
[2:36:10.040 --> 2:36:13.880]  Millions have already starved to death, not from COVID, but from the lockdown.
[2:36:13.880 --> 2:36:18.280]  That's why it's important for people in North America to get prepared all over the world.
[2:36:18.280 --> 2:36:22.960]  But we have high-quality, swarble food, ready to ship to you the last 25 years and prepare

[2:37:09.160 --> 2:37:11.280]  It will then ask you to name the app.
[2:37:11.280 --> 2:37:13.560]  I suggest Band.video.
[2:37:13.560 --> 2:37:18.160]  You will now have Band.video app on your home screen, despite the fact that Tim Cook tried
[2:37:18.160 --> 2:37:19.160]  to stop it.
[2:37:19.160 --> 2:37:23.280]  The globalists think you're lazy, but by taking a little bit of action, you can override them,
[2:37:23.280 --> 2:37:27.480]  have the app, and then tell others about it so they can get the app.
[2:37:27.480 --> 2:37:31.520]  So it's up to you whether you want to defy big tech and click the Share buttons below
[2:37:31.520 --> 2:37:35.320]  on your email, on Facebook, on Twitter, on YouTube, however you want.
[2:37:35.320 --> 2:38:04.080]  Be sure and share Band.video.
[2:38:04.080 --> 2:38:09.680]  The plan is a global ID to have a job, to drive a car, to go to the movies, get on an
[2:38:09.680 --> 2:38:10.680]  airplane.
[2:38:10.680 --> 2:38:14.240]  You take all the vaccines that you in, controlled by Big Pharma, says you must take.
[2:38:14.240 --> 2:38:18.160]  You know, they admit the vaccines can really hurt you or even kill you.
[2:38:18.160 --> 2:38:20.000]  That's their plan.
[2:38:20.000 --> 2:38:24.640]  And here's the new article up at infowars.com.
[2:38:24.640 --> 2:38:30.120]  Vaccine minister says bars, restaurants, and cinemas will deny anyone entry that does not
[2:38:30.120 --> 2:38:33.280]  have proof of vaccination before entry.
[2:38:33.280 --> 2:38:38.440]  Even though they admit the COVID-19 vaccines won't even protect you.
[2:38:38.440 --> 2:38:41.120]  That is the type of stuff going on next hour before Jerusalem.
[2:38:41.120 --> 2:38:42.120]  They take over at 15 after.
[2:38:42.120 --> 2:38:46.200]  I'm going to hit the big COVID-19 stack of the total police take global takeover in
[2:38:46.200 --> 2:38:50.520]  Reykjavik, the head of Proud Boys is here with us.
[2:38:50.520 --> 2:38:54.080]  And again, they're a demonized group they've been lied about.
[2:38:54.080 --> 2:38:58.640]  They used a fake FBI report that they were a terror group to then de-platform and take
[2:38:58.640 --> 2:39:01.280]  the bank accounts away of most of their members.
[2:39:01.280 --> 2:39:03.640]  Thanks for supporting Proud Boys that happened in Reykjavik.
[2:39:03.640 --> 2:39:06.560]  Again, a lot of people say, well, we better run away from this group.
[2:39:06.560 --> 2:39:09.120]  No, because it'll be you next.
[2:39:09.120 --> 2:39:11.480]  That's why infowars need support as well.
[2:39:11.480 --> 2:39:15.000]  About a year and a half ago when they rebanned us on Facebook, they said, you can't even
[2:39:15.000 --> 2:39:17.440]  say something nice about Alex Jones.
[2:39:17.440 --> 2:39:22.080]  The reason was he had on Gavin McGinnis, who's the founder of Proud Boys, he's even more
[2:39:22.080 --> 2:39:23.560]  evil than Alex Jones.
[2:39:23.560 --> 2:39:24.560]  Why?
[2:39:24.560 --> 2:39:25.560]  Because they're proud to be men.
[2:39:25.560 --> 2:39:26.720]  They're closer to everybody.
[2:39:26.720 --> 2:39:27.720]  They're proud of America.
[2:39:27.720 --> 2:39:31.560]  And they're not rolling over to communist thugs, so they're enemy number one.
[2:39:31.560 --> 2:39:35.200]  I would imagine Americans would run towards an organization like that, not away from it.
[2:39:35.200 --> 2:39:39.960]  I know they did great security for us, but the rest of our security, but that close to
[2:39:39.960 --> 2:39:44.720]  a million person march in DC a few weeks ago, another even bigger march, if you come, is
[2:39:44.720 --> 2:39:50.680]  on the 12th to support our president ahead of the electors on the 15th, it is beyond
[2:39:50.680 --> 2:39:51.680]  critical.
[2:39:51.680 --> 2:40:01.120]  We're running the new big special, it is the promo code PATRIOT at checkout at infowarsstore.com.

[2:40:29.280 --> 2:40:30.920]  lot of money to run this operation.
[2:40:30.920 --> 2:40:33.960]  We had to build our own infrastructure, you know, Google has spent hundreds of billions
[2:40:33.960 --> 2:40:37.440]  of dollars on the infrastructure, Twitter tens of billions of dollars, Apple hundreds
[2:40:37.440 --> 2:40:42.880]  of billions of dollars, I've spent on infrastructure, you got to keep it updated and running over
[2:40:42.880 --> 2:40:43.880]  the years.
[2:40:43.880 --> 2:40:49.960]  Independent satellite uplink servers, everything costs us $5, $6, $10 million a year depending
[2:40:49.960 --> 2:40:55.880]  on the year to run all this, and running our own servers with millions of views a day sounds
[2:40:55.880 --> 2:41:00.920]  great, costs thousands of dollars an hour, especially like, oh my god, we're like a few
[2:41:00.920 --> 2:41:03.480]  weeks ago, our traffic's five times whatever.
[2:41:03.480 --> 2:41:08.880]  Look out though, the bill's going to be $500,000 this month, that's where your money's going.
[2:41:08.880 --> 2:41:11.640]  So if you want to keep this on the air, now during this critical time, now that we've
[2:41:11.640 --> 2:41:15.360]  been proven right, now that they're censoring everybody else, now that InfoWars is becoming
[2:41:15.360 --> 2:41:20.360]  more important by the minute, as what we've documented becomes reality, we're only kept
[2:41:20.360 --> 2:41:24.520]  in attack formation, we're only kept in the fight because of you, so just as important

[2:41:40.920 --> 2:41:45.960]  to Enrique Ataria before we hit the COVID lockdowns and all the rest of it next hour.
[2:41:45.960 --> 2:41:46.960]  What else do you want to head on?
[2:41:46.960 --> 2:41:50.440]  Well, you said to talk about my family in Cuba.
[2:41:50.440 --> 2:41:51.440]  Oh, you wanted to get to that?
[2:41:51.440 --> 2:41:52.440]  Yeah, let's talk about that.
[2:41:52.440 --> 2:41:56.480]  Yeah, so it's the utopia they were offering.
[2:41:56.480 --> 2:42:00.640]  The utopia that they were offering, they were saying, he said it's not a Marxist revolution,
[2:42:00.640 --> 2:42:05.520]  it's not a communist revolution, it's a revolution for the people, right?
[2:42:05.520 --> 2:42:10.580]  And they painted a pretty picture, and when his revolutionary forces was invading the
[2:42:10.580 --> 2:42:17.280]  island from the west coast to the east coast, there was this little farm, and Che Guevara
[2:42:17.280 --> 2:42:20.280]  was in charge of the forces, and they went and they knocked on the door, and they're
[2:42:20.280 --> 2:42:25.440]  like, hey, we need your farm for a Ford operating base to get to the city, which was just a
[2:42:25.440 --> 2:42:27.280]  mile away.
[2:42:27.280 --> 2:42:33.600]  And when that family denied him access to the farm, so they went back, they talked to Che
[2:42:33.600 --> 2:42:35.480]  Guevara, and Che Guevara gave him the orders.
[2:42:35.480 --> 2:42:41.880]  They went back to that house, and they took the two adult males out of that house, and
[2:42:41.880 --> 2:42:46.560]  they put them on their knees, tied their hands behind their back, and shot them in the head.
[2:42:46.560 --> 2:42:49.480]  Well that family is my family.
[2:42:49.480 --> 2:42:56.920]  We share last name, those were brothers of my grandfather, and soon after that they took
[2:42:56.920 --> 2:43:01.240]  over the island, and my family decided to come over here, and what I'm hearing from
[2:43:01.240 --> 2:43:08.320]  the Democrats now, is not as scary to me as it is familiar, because I've been to the
[2:43:08.320 --> 2:43:12.400]  island, I used to travel to the island two, three times a year, I have more family over
[2:43:12.400 --> 2:43:18.480]  there than I do over here, and I just see it, I see it, and a Biden presidency will
[2:43:18.480 --> 2:43:23.280]  accelerate that, we won't, I mean think about this, if we think the voting machines now
[2:43:23.280 --> 2:43:28.200]  are so bad, imagine when Biden gets into his presidency, if we think the censorship
[2:43:28.200 --> 2:43:32.760]  is bad, imagine when Biden gets in there, the restrictions that we have on our second
[2:43:32.760 --> 2:43:37.240]  amendment, there's 22,000 gun laws in this country, how many more are going to keep American
[2:43:37.240 --> 2:43:39.640]  safe?
[2:43:39.640 --> 2:43:43.720]  With Joe Biden as president, we know, we know that they're going to come to your house,
[2:43:43.720 --> 2:43:49.120]  we know that they're going to come knock on your door, we know that they're taking your
[2:43:49.120 --> 2:43:55.420]  guns, it's not just like this, they're telling us, they're making their move, they're making
[2:43:55.420 --> 2:44:00.800]  their move, so a Biden presidency is probably the biggest threat to this country since the
[2:44:00.800 --> 2:44:01.800]  British.
[2:44:01.800 --> 2:44:08.560]  I totally agree with that statement, and this ideology is even worse, theirs was a quasi-capitalist
[2:44:08.560 --> 2:44:13.760]  imperial model, still bad, this is pure death, and I don't know if you saw earlier, the Chinese
[2:44:13.760 --> 2:44:18.600]  government now has national TV shows bragging, aha, COVID locked them down, America's done,
[2:44:18.600 --> 2:44:26.040]  death to America, and the average leftist thinks Gigi pings a hero, well not only that, I mean
[2:44:26.040 --> 2:44:29.160]  we have another thing that we're doing to fight back, because that's the most important
[2:44:29.160 --> 2:44:33.160]  thing, we know what the problem is, but we're trying to find the solution, the solution
[2:44:33.160 --> 2:44:39.080]  is to get out on the street, as another thing as we're talking right now, Rufio is planning
[2:44:39.080 --> 2:44:46.760]  to fight these COVID restrictions up in Seattle, with straight defiance, walking in, taking
[2:44:46.760 --> 2:44:50.880]  off your mask and sitting there, and if he gets put in chains, he gets put in chains,
[2:44:50.880 --> 2:44:54.800]  but he knows that that's what it's going to take, it's going to take us to fight back,
[2:44:54.800 --> 2:44:59.440]  to finally sit here, I mean what's been happening in the past couple of months is amazing to
[2:44:59.440 --> 2:45:08.440]  me Alex, we've never seen the right wing get together in such mass on the streets, hit
[2:45:08.440 --> 2:45:13.680]  these streets, hit the asphalt, and now we're given a gift, and we need to keep using that
[2:45:13.680 --> 2:45:19.320]  gift, and we need to keep inspiring more people to come out, not just to December 12th, to
[2:45:19.320 --> 2:45:21.320]  come out every single time.
[2:45:21.320 --> 2:45:25.120]  That's right, they've censored you, they're trying to take you over, now you've got to
[2:45:25.120 --> 2:45:30.280]  get really aggressive politically, and let the system know you're not buying their fraud,
[2:45:30.280 --> 2:45:33.800]  because if they get us down with this ongoing lockdown in Biden, they're never going to
[2:45:33.800 --> 2:45:34.800]  let us back up.
[2:45:34.800 --> 2:45:39.640]  No, no, we won't see the White House, we won't ever see the White House again.
[2:45:39.640 --> 2:45:45.800]  Go back though to the, I mean in Cuba, wealthy, prosperous, incredible, building up, and then
[2:45:45.800 --> 2:45:49.880]  now they were just showing shots of a grocery store there, I mean you can't get aspirin,
[2:45:49.880 --> 2:45:50.880]  you can't, there's nothing.
[2:45:50.880 --> 2:45:56.480]  No, so, and it's crazy, it's like the opposite of nationalism, right, so if I, if you or
[2:45:56.480 --> 2:46:00.480]  I were to go to Cuba with an American passport, you're treated like royalty.
[2:46:00.480 --> 2:46:04.440]  You can eat at restaurants, well the little bit of restaurants that they have that actually
[2:46:04.440 --> 2:46:10.560]  have food, but if you are a Cuban citizen, you cannot walk into these restaurants.
[2:46:10.560 --> 2:46:16.280]  You cannot eat where tourists eat, it's the complete opposite, they, they, same thing
[2:46:16.280 --> 2:46:20.160]  North Korea, because they want to keep their foot on your neck.
[2:46:20.160 --> 2:46:25.200]  And they have, in Cuba, they've taken away, they've not only taken away weapons, that's
[2:46:25.200 --> 2:46:27.440]  a long time ago.
[2:46:27.440 --> 2:46:34.080]  They keep the people hungry to keep them busy, that's their thing, you keep people starving
[2:46:34.080 --> 2:46:37.880]  so they can worry about food and not worry about revolution.
[2:46:37.880 --> 2:46:43.440]  And right now, by the way, a Bilderberg group in Davos like five years ago said, we need
[2:46:43.440 --> 2:46:47.720]  to make people more hungry, there's too much wealth, people shouldn't protest us, we're
[2:46:47.720 --> 2:46:49.720]  going to make you poor, they actually said that.
[2:46:49.720 --> 2:46:54.560]  Yeah, no, and that's true, that's, that's, that's part of their playbook.
[2:46:54.560 --> 2:46:59.800]  Starving them out, silencing them, two days ago we just saw like the artists, artists
[2:46:59.800 --> 2:47:04.920]  and musicians, they got together and they, they're protesting in Cuba right now, for
[2:47:04.920 --> 2:47:08.640]  the past like two days, but they've already imprisoned like half of them.
[2:47:08.640 --> 2:47:11.360]  So their numbers are going down, down, down.
[2:47:11.360 --> 2:47:15.280]  And like when you do that, you want to do something, but you, you've got a family to
[2:47:15.280 --> 2:47:16.280]  take care of.
[2:47:16.280 --> 2:47:19.480]  So if you're put in a, in a Cuban prison, you're never getting out.
[2:47:19.480 --> 2:47:23.920]  That's it, your family, your family can't be fed, your family, that's it, it's, it's
[2:47:23.920 --> 2:47:28.120]  practically over for you.
[2:47:28.120 --> 2:47:31.640]  Does the average Cuban gaslet and believes the fraud, I've, I've heard from Cubans that
[2:47:31.640 --> 2:47:33.400]  almost no one buys it now, they know it's fraud.
[2:47:33.400 --> 2:47:38.520]  No, there's a reason, there's, so we always call Florida a battleground state.
[2:47:38.520 --> 2:47:43.400]  But what we saw in Florida in this election was the opposite of a battleground state.
[2:47:43.400 --> 2:47:46.360]  We blew the doors off the Democrats.
[2:47:46.360 --> 2:47:51.240]  We're putting together, together 35,000 car caravans, we're putting together marches,
[2:47:51.240 --> 2:47:55.400]  events every weekend, I'm out, when I'm in, when I'm in Miami, I'm out every day, my
[2:47:55.400 --> 2:47:56.400]  guys are out.
[2:47:56.400 --> 2:47:59.800]  Trump won by a massive lot, landslide everywhere, that's why they had to just come in and stuff
[2:47:59.800 --> 2:48:00.800]  it.
[2:48:00.800 --> 2:48:03.280]  The word is Trump won California even people want away from the commies.
[2:48:03.280 --> 2:48:04.280]  Yeah.
[2:48:04.280 --> 2:48:10.120]  I wholeheartedly agree with you and, but Cubans, we don't, we don't buy, why do you think that
[2:48:10.120 --> 2:48:17.520]  Obama ended wet foot, dry foot, there's a reason, that's because he doesn't want more
[2:48:17.520 --> 2:48:18.520]  Cubans in the US.
[2:48:18.520 --> 2:48:21.600]  He doesn't want more Cubans in a, in a swing state.
[2:48:21.600 --> 2:48:25.360]  But then I've also read other, not just Hispanics, well, people are learning from the Cubans
[2:48:25.360 --> 2:48:26.880]  about communism and Venezuela.
[2:48:26.880 --> 2:48:27.880]  Yeah.
[2:48:27.880 --> 2:48:28.880]  Venezuela.
[2:48:28.880 --> 2:48:29.880]  We'll be right back in two minutes.
[2:48:29.880 --> 2:48:30.880]  Stay with us.
[2:48:30.880 --> 2:48:31.880]  Get Ricky Tarris, our guest.
[2:48:31.880 --> 2:48:35.960]  Ladies and gentlemen, I hope we can stop the great reset.
[2:48:35.960 --> 2:48:41.080]  That means a globalist imposed worldwide depression to break us and bring us under their control.
[2:48:41.080 --> 2:48:45.120]  That's their state-admitted plan, Justin Trudeau's on record, Klaus Schwab, all the different
[2:48:45.120 --> 2:48:49.560]  Democrat mayors, they admit it's clowered in heaven, implode the economy to make us
[2:48:49.560 --> 2:48:50.560]  go under their control.
[2:48:50.560 --> 2:48:55.320]  But if we expose, they're the ones doing it, they go to prison instead of getting total
[2:48:55.320 --> 2:48:56.320]  power and total control.
[2:48:56.320 --> 2:49:00.840]  And there are major uprisings happening across the world during the US, thousands of sheriffs
[2:49:00.840 --> 2:49:04.600]  are saying hell no to the lockdowns, people are finally starting to fight back.
[2:49:04.600 --> 2:49:06.760]  But regardless, you need to get prepared.
[2:49:06.760 --> 2:49:11.720]  We have high-quality, swarble food last 25 years, highest quality, lowest prices, great
[2:49:11.720 --> 2:49:15.760]  containers ready to ship, but when people figure this out in a few months, I think there'll
[2:49:15.760 --> 2:49:19.960]  be long lines again to get swarble food after the lockdown has been going for a few months.

[2:49:33.800 --> 2:49:39.040]  There is an economic war taking place of the ruling class to consolidate power and control.
[2:49:39.040 --> 2:49:43.040]  There's a headline out from zero heads that breaks down Bloomberg numbers that global
[2:49:43.040 --> 2:49:49.520]  airlines are set to lose $157 billion this year by the end of December, it's already
[2:49:49.520 --> 2:49:52.640]  over $130 billion they've lost.
[2:49:52.640 --> 2:49:58.520]  Why would they take part in the hoax, in the lockdown, in the hysteria if it hurts them?
[2:49:58.520 --> 2:50:01.920]  We'll see, that'll knock out all the small airlines and consolidate control, and it's
[2:50:01.920 --> 2:50:06.320]  the same in every single industry, and the big megabanks have unlimited capital.
[2:50:06.320 --> 2:50:11.000]  They want to bankrupt the world economy, build a buy-it-up for pennies on the dollar, that's
[2:50:11.000 --> 2:50:14.840]  why the great stock market crash of 29 later turned out was engineered by some central
[2:50:14.840 --> 2:50:15.840]  banks.
[2:50:15.840 --> 2:50:18.640]  This is how the globalists take control.
[2:50:18.640 --> 2:50:23.720]  It stars the third world to death, makes the first world poor, it's economic warfare, and
[2:50:23.720 --> 2:50:28.360]  it gives cover to the big megabanks that created thousands of trillions of dollars in fake
[2:50:28.360 --> 2:50:29.360]  derivatives.
[2:50:29.360 --> 2:50:36.640]  Only the truth will set us free in pullwars.com.
[2:50:36.640 --> 2:50:54.480]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[2:50:54.480 --> 2:51:23.400]  It's up like $1,000 today I think, right, it's up like $1,000.
[2:51:23.400 --> 2:51:49.280]  I don't know enough about it to tell you, but yeah, BTC is the standard right now that
[2:51:49.280 --> 2:51:50.280]  we're seeing.
[2:51:50.280 --> 2:52:08.480]  I don't know about this next segment, but I don't get how the globalists get away with
[2:52:08.480 --> 2:52:14.080]  bragging that they're using COVID as a way to bankrupt everyone to, quote, make us reset,
[2:52:14.080 --> 2:52:17.480]  and then they all live above the law, super rich, but tell us they're building utopia
[2:52:17.480 --> 2:52:20.760]  for us, whether they're internal reports or they just want to make us poor to control
[2:52:20.760 --> 2:52:22.000]  us, as you said earlier.
[2:52:22.000 --> 2:52:25.320]  I don't see how Klaus Schwab and Bill Gates get away with this.
[2:52:25.320 --> 2:52:26.560]  I don't get it either.
[2:52:26.560 --> 2:52:31.160]  I guess it works everywhere else, so why not, because the public doesn't have a memory.
[2:52:31.160 --> 2:52:32.880]  And all they get is pies to the face.
[2:52:32.880 --> 2:52:37.640]  I think you remember that, but they were hitting them with pies in the face, and they just
[2:52:37.640 --> 2:52:38.640]  continue to do this.
[2:52:38.640 --> 2:52:43.320]  And I think we saw, I forgot where it was where he killed a whole bunch of kids with
[2:52:43.320 --> 2:52:44.320]  this vaccine that was.
[2:52:44.320 --> 2:52:45.320]  That's all over the place.
[2:52:45.320 --> 2:52:47.000]  He's been kicked out of 22 countries, Bill Gates.
[2:52:47.000 --> 2:52:48.680]  I mean, it's, it's, it's in mainline news.
[2:52:48.680 --> 2:52:52.740]  I was on Joe Rogan's show three weeks ago and I go, yeah, the number one cause of
[2:52:52.740 --> 2:52:53.740]  polygos, Bill Gates.
[2:52:53.740 --> 2:52:54.740]  And he's like, oh, come on.
[2:52:54.740 --> 2:52:55.740]  And he didn't even notice this.
[2:52:55.740 --> 2:52:56.740]  I remember that.
[2:52:56.740 --> 2:52:57.740]  But it got no coverage.
[2:52:57.740 --> 2:52:58.740]  No.
[2:52:58.740 --> 2:53:00.360]  They just go, oh yeah, he kills everybody.
[2:53:00.360 --> 2:53:01.360]  That's the whole thing.
[2:53:01.360 --> 2:53:05.400]  So they're able to, just a little while ago, we were able, we put a Twitter on the, on
[2:53:05.400 --> 2:53:07.900]  the, a Twitter handle on the screen.
[2:53:07.900 --> 2:53:12.120]  So when I was running for Congress in the 27th district, I opened a new Twitter account.
[2:53:12.120 --> 2:53:15.200]  I'm like, okay, Twitter can't ban a candidate.
[2:53:15.200 --> 2:53:16.600]  It took about a week.
[2:53:16.600 --> 2:53:19.200]  And somebody made a parody account of, uh, there you go.
[2:53:19.200 --> 2:53:21.080]  That's the pie in the face.
[2:53:21.080 --> 2:53:22.080]  And that's it.
[2:53:22.080 --> 2:53:23.080]  That's all he gets.
[2:53:23.080 --> 2:53:32.920]  That's the worst thing that happens to Bill Gates and, uh, well, go ahead and, and I lost
[2:53:32.920 --> 2:53:33.920]  my train.
[2:53:33.920 --> 2:53:34.920]  So I made a parody account.
[2:53:34.920 --> 2:53:38.960]  Oh, somebody made a parody account and that one's still on there.
[2:53:38.960 --> 2:53:42.560]  I had, I had somebody from Info Wars call me yesterday, they're like, Hey, why are you
[2:53:42.560 --> 2:53:43.560]  anti Trump right now?
[2:53:43.560 --> 2:53:46.480]  And I'm like, I'm not, I don't have a Twitter account.
[2:53:46.480 --> 2:53:47.480]  Yeah.
[2:53:47.480 --> 2:53:51.080]  That's something like I've been banned off Twitter as they have parody accounts, people,
[2:53:51.080 --> 2:53:55.840]  people go and attack those accounts like they're actually attacking me and the people will
[2:53:55.840 --> 2:53:58.160]  pose it like they're me and Twitter wants that stuff to stay up.
[2:53:58.160 --> 2:53:59.160]  Yeah.
[2:53:59.160 --> 2:54:00.160]  So he'll call me and they go, is that real?
[2:54:00.160 --> 2:54:01.880]  I was going, whatever you want to be real, go ahead and make it real.
[2:54:01.880 --> 2:54:03.960]  Well, we're beyond censorship at that point.
[2:54:03.960 --> 2:54:04.960]  Right.
[2:54:04.960 --> 2:54:09.440]  It's, it's, it's, they're creating this fake narrative where they go, once they censor
[2:54:09.440 --> 2:54:11.280]  you, they can create the thank you.
[2:54:11.280 --> 2:54:12.280]  Yeah.
[2:54:12.280 --> 2:54:13.880]  And even people here, here's the problem with it.
[2:54:13.880 --> 2:54:15.320]  It's not, I don't care what the left says.
[2:54:15.320 --> 2:54:16.720]  Like, I'm not interested.
[2:54:16.720 --> 2:54:19.520]  There's other people to have dialogue with the left.
[2:54:19.520 --> 2:54:21.080]  There's other people that'll do that.
[2:54:21.080 --> 2:54:23.800]  That's not my, that's not my focus.
[2:54:23.800 --> 2:54:25.840]  But people that support us, right?
[2:54:25.840 --> 2:54:26.840]  See this, right?
[2:54:26.840 --> 2:54:30.920]  And they're like, man, he, he's, he swapped on, he sold us out.
[2:54:30.920 --> 2:54:31.920]  And that's it.
[2:54:31.920 --> 2:54:32.920]  It's over.
[2:54:32.920 --> 2:54:33.920]  Right.
[2:54:33.920 --> 2:54:34.920]  And they're allowed to do this.
[2:54:34.920 --> 2:54:37.560]  So the only way to combat it is get louder.
[2:54:37.560 --> 2:54:39.320]  Well, that's how the psyops work.
[2:54:39.320 --> 2:54:40.920]  So you are not on Twitter.
[2:54:40.920 --> 2:54:42.120]  No.
[2:54:42.120 --> 2:54:44.640]  And I am not on Twitter and I'm not on Facebook.
[2:54:44.640 --> 2:54:46.800]  There are fan pages out there, but some of them are fake.
[2:54:46.800 --> 2:54:49.120]  And a lot of people just want to stir up controversy.
[2:54:49.120 --> 2:54:52.760]  I would imagine people that stirred that up actually knew that that wasn't you.
[2:54:52.760 --> 2:54:53.760]  They're probably people running it.
[2:54:53.760 --> 2:54:55.240]  No, I know who's running it.
[2:54:55.240 --> 2:54:56.240]  Yeah.
[2:54:56.240 --> 2:54:58.960]  It's, it's, it's Antifa that's running it out of South Florida.
[2:54:58.960 --> 2:54:59.960]  Yeah.
[2:54:59.960 --> 2:55:02.200]  And I can't do anything about it.
[2:55:02.200 --> 2:55:04.200]  There's nothing that I can do about it.
[2:55:04.200 --> 2:55:08.880]  Well, let me tell you, after this, this whole election, after this whole election process,
[2:55:08.880 --> 2:55:14.120]  I will, I am going to shift my focus and the focus of the Proud Boys will be shifting over
[2:55:14.120 --> 2:55:18.680]  into social media and tech censorship and probably in the most fun way that you can
[2:55:18.680 --> 2:55:19.680]  imagine.
[2:55:19.680 --> 2:55:22.640]  Well, that's the answer is innovation is now you notice, they said, oh, build your
[2:55:22.640 --> 2:55:23.640]  own thing.
[2:55:23.640 --> 2:55:27.280]  Now Brian Stelter and others don't want us to even have parlor or have them for us.
[2:55:27.280 --> 2:55:30.840]  Oh, no, we got a, and then there shouldn't be Tucker Carlson either.
[2:55:30.840 --> 2:55:33.040]  We'll be right back with the latest COVID news.
[2:55:33.040 --> 2:55:34.040]  They're being excused.
[2:55:34.040 --> 2:55:35.040]  They're being fraud.
[2:55:35.040 --> 2:55:46.000]  And then Joe Salante takes over, prepare with Alex.com is a special website with my
[2:55:46.000 --> 2:55:49.880]  Patriot because they have agreements with other distributors that they all sell the
[2:55:49.880 --> 2:55:55.760]  same low price, high quality, horrible food, but occasionally they can do promotions on
[2:55:55.760 --> 2:55:56.760]  their own platform.
[2:55:56.760 --> 2:56:02.200]  And that's what we've set up with them is that prepare with Alex.com is a sub domain
[2:56:02.200 --> 2:56:05.360]  of my Patriot, you get an additional 10% off.
[2:56:05.360 --> 2:56:10.480]  We have their whole great catalog info or store.com or you can normally get it at very
[2:56:10.480 --> 2:56:16.720]  good prices and those prices are still there, but an additional 10% off right now at prepare
[2:56:16.720 --> 2:56:21.560]  with Alex.com on their one month or three months or six months or a year and on a bunch
[2:56:21.560 --> 2:56:27.480]  of other great items, huge discounts that will be ending next Wednesday.
[2:56:27.480 --> 2:56:29.680]  That is December 2.
[2:56:29.680 --> 2:56:33.520]  So you've got this week and a little bit of next week to get your orders and they're
[2:56:33.520 --> 2:56:35.080]  ready to ship to you right now.
[2:56:35.080 --> 2:56:39.080]  And the profit that comes in funds the info or social 360 when you need horrible food to
[2:56:39.080 --> 2:56:53.280]  fight the great reset, get prepared now.
[2:56:53.280 --> 2:57:01.080]  Rashing through the lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones.
[2:57:01.080 --> 2:57:05.960]  Well the evil Enrique Tarrio, the head of the proud boys this year, whether she hadn't
[2:57:05.960 --> 2:57:09.920]  done anything wrong, hasn't committed any crimes, hasn't hurt anybody that didn't attack
[2:57:09.920 --> 2:57:15.040]  him first, but he's supposedly a terrorist cause they ran a fake story to the proud boys
[2:57:15.040 --> 2:57:19.720]  or terrorists a year and a half ago and use that, the platform them all.
[2:57:19.720 --> 2:57:24.680]  But meanwhile, look at these headlines, even the Washington Post, Apple is lobbying to
[2:57:24.680 --> 2:57:32.640]  undercut law condemning Chinese slave labor used at their factories and subcontractors.
[2:57:32.640 --> 2:57:37.240]  Apple lobbies against Yeager forced labor bill that would just condemn it.
[2:57:37.240 --> 2:57:41.640]  So man, imagine, you know, if you were running forced labor camps where they actually killed
[2:57:41.640 --> 2:57:45.000]  people, I would, I would, you know, I'd say you're a piece of crap.
[2:57:45.000 --> 2:57:46.000]  Yep.
[2:57:46.000 --> 2:57:49.640]  I wouldn't have you on the show and said you're the opposite fighting against these people.
[2:57:49.640 --> 2:57:50.880]  But Tim Cook says he's a liberal.
[2:57:50.880 --> 2:57:51.880]  So it's okay.
[2:57:51.880 --> 2:57:54.960]  It's like, well, yeah, I mean, we run the worst camps where they take organs and kill
[2:57:54.960 --> 2:57:55.960]  people.
[2:57:55.960 --> 2:57:58.360]  They've got Australian reports, British Intel reports, confirm it.
[2:57:58.360 --> 2:57:59.360]  China doesn't deny it.
[2:57:59.360 --> 2:58:03.360]  But see, you're, you're not killing people for their organs, Christians, Muslims and
[2:58:03.360 --> 2:58:05.440]  Buddhists show you're the bad guy.
[2:58:05.440 --> 2:58:07.000]  You're speaking out against that.
[2:58:07.000 --> 2:58:09.520]  This is the left is just pure scum now.
[2:58:09.520 --> 2:58:14.400]  I guess they always were because the average leftist comes up to me and says, F you on
[2:58:14.400 --> 2:58:18.360]  the street and I'll say, Hey, what about the slave camps in China that Apple supports?
[2:58:18.360 --> 2:58:19.800]  Shut up, Nazi.
[2:58:19.800 --> 2:58:20.800]  They don't care.
[2:58:20.800 --> 2:58:21.800]  They don't care.
[2:58:21.800 --> 2:58:25.120]  They just want the authority to say that, Oh, they're part of the rebel HQ and they're
[2:58:25.120 --> 2:58:26.120]  battling the establishment.
[2:58:26.120 --> 2:58:27.120]  Hey, guess what?
[2:58:27.120 --> 2:58:28.120]  You're the establishment.
[2:58:28.120 --> 2:58:30.080]  You've got all the banks, all the media.
[2:58:30.080 --> 2:58:31.680]  You're boosted by the whole system.
[2:58:31.680 --> 2:58:33.200]  You're backed up by dictators.
[2:58:33.200 --> 2:58:35.880]  How dare them say they're the resistance, brother?
[2:58:35.880 --> 2:58:36.880]  We're the resistance.
[2:58:36.880 --> 2:58:40.080]  We're definitely the resistance that we've become the counterculture at this point.
[2:58:40.080 --> 2:58:47.080]  And you know, you made an example out of that and like people that support Biden, go ahead
[2:58:47.080 --> 2:58:52.560]  and mention the Obama drone bombings, mentioned the amount of hospitals he's drone bombed.
[2:58:52.560 --> 2:58:53.560]  And it's like it's non-existent.
[2:58:53.560 --> 2:58:57.080]  And then Trump pulled out all these wars, but he's bad conspiracy theorists.
[2:58:57.080 --> 2:58:59.320]  They'll take you off the internet.
[2:58:59.320 --> 2:59:04.100]  We've seen, we've seen them go ahead and, uh, and take down the president's tweets.
[2:59:04.100 --> 2:59:05.720]  Every tweet now has a warning.
[2:59:05.720 --> 2:59:11.720]  Every single one has a warning, uh, from Twitter, uh, Senator Paul, yeah, who put out real admitted
[2:59:11.720 --> 2:59:12.720]  stuff.
[2:59:12.720 --> 2:59:13.720]  Yeah.
[2:59:13.720 --> 2:59:19.520]  We've become the arbiters of truth because no longer, I mean, obviously our, the million
[2:59:19.520 --> 2:59:24.240]  mega march was, was big noise, but no longer can I stand in a street corner with a sign
[2:59:24.240 --> 2:59:25.600]  and make a difference.
[2:59:25.600 --> 2:59:30.440]  Social media has become this place where, where you could electronic town square, the
[2:59:30.440 --> 2:59:33.040]  electronic town square and something needs to be done about it.
[2:59:33.040 --> 2:59:35.520]  The president has to, has to act on this.
[2:59:35.520 --> 2:59:38.800]  And I think it's, it's the most important thing that he needs to, it needs to be an
[2:59:38.800 --> 2:59:39.880]  EO on his desk.
[2:59:39.880 --> 2:59:40.880]  I don't know.
[2:59:40.880 --> 2:59:41.880]  I'm not a legislator.
[2:59:41.880 --> 2:59:42.880]  I don't know how to fix this.
[2:59:42.880 --> 2:59:44.760]  I'm just, I'm just a dude that puts people on the street.
[2:59:44.760 --> 2:59:45.760]  No, you're a smart guy.
[2:59:45.760 --> 2:59:48.520]  We need to, they need to de-classify it all.
[2:59:48.520 --> 2:59:52.840]  They need to de-classify everything and he needs to make an EO with some action towards
[2:59:52.840 --> 2:59:57.440]  either section 230 or, uh, break up these, these tech giants.
[2:59:57.440 --> 2:59:58.640]  It's one way or another.
[2:59:58.640 --> 3:00:00.120]  There's no other solution.
[3:00:00.120 --> 3:00:01.120]  He needs to act on it.
[3:00:01.120 --> 3:00:04.400]  I'm asking the president to act on it and he needs to act on it like right now.
[3:00:04.400 --> 3:00:11.720]  Well, there's just such arrogance by the Larry pages and the Serge Brins and all of them.
[3:00:11.720 --> 3:00:17.520]  They're just involved in such evil and corruption while shaking their finger at us like they
[3:00:17.520 --> 3:00:21.440]  have a moral authority when they're horrible authoritarians.
[3:00:21.440 --> 3:00:22.440]  Yeah.
[3:00:22.440 --> 3:00:28.680]  And, and when, when they do that, when they shake their finger at us, I think the best
[3:00:28.680 --> 3:00:34.640]  thing that somebody does is laugh at them, ridicule them because there's no reasoning
[3:00:34.640 --> 3:00:35.640]  with them.
[3:00:35.640 --> 3:00:37.560]  There's no way that you're going to change their mind.
[3:00:37.560 --> 3:00:39.400]  They are set in stone.
[3:00:39.400 --> 3:00:44.960]  There's nothing that you could tell them that would let them see things from your perspective.
[3:00:44.960 --> 3:00:48.720]  Again, I leave that to other people, but let's just say it.
[3:00:48.720 --> 3:00:52.760]  I mean, if you look at the average leftist, they, they don't know where they're going.
[3:00:52.760 --> 3:00:53.760]  They're super dumb.
[3:00:53.760 --> 3:00:55.360]  They have no skills.
[3:00:55.360 --> 3:00:58.200]  They're really victims of the system.
[3:00:58.200 --> 3:01:02.120]  They bought into it and they're idiots and they just keep hoping if they double down
[3:01:02.120 --> 3:01:04.880]  on it, they're going to get this big position of power when they're not.
[3:01:04.880 --> 3:01:08.960]  And that's the people that always bring the communist to power, even shake Lovara, end
[3:01:08.960 --> 3:01:10.440]  up getting it.
[3:01:10.440 --> 3:01:11.440]  They will.
[3:01:11.440 --> 3:01:12.440]  They will.
[3:01:12.440 --> 3:01:15.720]  And those, and we saw it with the, with the revolution in Cuba as soon as there were
[3:01:15.720 --> 3:01:20.080]  throwaways, some of these revolutionaries that, that believed in it were throwaways or
[3:01:20.080 --> 3:01:24.440]  people that they executed within weeks of them taking power.
[3:01:24.440 --> 3:01:25.440]  They didn't need it.
[3:01:25.440 --> 3:01:26.440]  They didn't need them.
[3:01:26.440 --> 3:01:27.440]  Right.
[3:01:27.440 --> 3:01:30.640]  Well, you always get rid of an authoritarian system of the people that bring it to power.
[3:01:30.640 --> 3:01:32.200]  Same thing with Hitler in the, in the essay.
[3:01:32.200 --> 3:01:33.200]  Yeah.
[3:01:33.200 --> 3:01:34.920]  First thing you do is get rid of them.
[3:01:34.920 --> 3:01:35.920]  Exactly.
[3:01:35.920 --> 3:01:37.720]  And, and that's what we're seeing here.
[3:01:37.720 --> 3:01:42.080]  We're seeing what we saw it with the Lincoln project and AOC, you know, I will tell you
[3:01:42.080 --> 3:01:49.480]  that the Lincoln project, besides all the money that they stole, they did build a good
[3:01:49.480 --> 3:01:52.800]  propaganda campaign, a lie, but they did build.
[3:01:52.800 --> 3:01:56.440]  And then what did AOC, the first thing she did, you know, people are like, Oh, you can't
[3:01:56.440 --> 3:01:57.440]  call her a communist.
[3:01:57.440 --> 3:01:58.440]  She's not a communist.
[3:01:58.440 --> 3:01:59.680]  Well, why is she acting like a communist?
[3:01:59.680 --> 3:02:03.680]  Because the first person after that election night, the first people that she went and
[3:02:03.680 --> 3:02:07.400]  attacked were the Lincoln project.
[3:02:07.400 --> 3:02:08.400]  They're discarded.
[3:02:08.400 --> 3:02:11.160]  They don't care about them.
[3:02:11.160 --> 3:02:15.200]  So it's a, it's a recurring theme.
[3:02:15.200 --> 3:02:20.160]  All right, you got a video player.
[3:02:20.160 --> 3:02:21.160]  Sorry.
[3:02:21.160 --> 3:02:22.160]  Doesn't bother me.
[3:02:22.160 --> 3:02:23.160]  We're live on air.
[3:02:23.160 --> 3:02:24.160]  That's what we have delays for.
[3:02:24.160 --> 3:02:25.160]  All right.
[3:02:25.160 --> 3:02:26.160]  That's a funny ringtone.
[3:02:26.160 --> 3:02:27.160]  Sorry.
[3:02:27.160 --> 3:02:28.160]  It's fun.
[3:02:28.160 --> 3:02:29.160]  I like it.
[3:02:29.160 --> 3:02:30.360]  Let's hit some of these headlines.
[3:02:30.360 --> 3:02:35.800]  Lynn Wood, one of Trump's lawyers says, not so sure Bill Gates will get emergency approval
[3:02:35.800 --> 3:02:42.800]  for Madera, Madera is a Gates vaccine, Gates urges depopulation theory, smaller servant
[3:02:42.800 --> 3:02:48.840]  class ruled by service elite, one plus one equals two, I will never take Moderna or any
[3:02:48.840 --> 3:02:49.840]  Gates vaccine.
[3:02:49.840 --> 3:02:53.000]  I'll rely on my immune system created by God.
[3:02:53.000 --> 3:02:54.880]  There's another one.
[3:02:54.880 --> 3:02:55.880]  Killing the future.
[3:02:55.880 --> 3:03:00.960]  COVID madness will lead to half a million fewer U.S. birth rates in 2021.
[3:03:00.960 --> 3:03:06.640]  And suicides, videos, CNN cancels Christmas, we just can't do it this year.
[3:03:06.640 --> 3:03:08.440]  I mean, this is unbelievable.
[3:03:08.440 --> 3:03:10.600]  These crops, that's not going to happen.
[3:03:10.600 --> 3:03:12.640]  They just want to, like, like, like they're in charge.
[3:03:12.640 --> 3:03:19.200]  It's Amazon goes on lockdown, hiring spree, all small businesses go bust and you look
[3:03:19.200 --> 3:03:24.400]  at all the numbers here of how all the big tech made record, record profits because they
[3:03:24.400 --> 3:03:27.200]  helped engineer this entire lockdown.
[3:03:27.200 --> 3:03:34.760]  Now, scroll down to that article, Amazon, an extra 91 billion, Walmart 338 billion,
[3:03:34.760 --> 3:03:42.560]  Google 37 billion, Microsoft 33 billion, Facebook 28 billion, Nike 8 billion, Apple 8 billion.
[3:03:42.560 --> 3:03:46.760]  Extra money during the lockdown, America's pride in the economy is about to be greatly
[3:03:46.760 --> 3:03:50.520]  shaken as tens of millions face eviction in 2021.
[3:03:50.520 --> 3:03:55.280]  They say because of COVID, no, because of the hoax lockdown.
[3:03:55.280 --> 3:03:59.040]  Black winner was a code name for a scenario in which biological weapon was used against
[3:03:59.040 --> 3:04:00.040]  the American people.
[3:04:00.040 --> 3:04:06.040]  Common is China admits COVID is that landmark legal ruling finds that COVID test not fit
[3:04:06.040 --> 3:04:07.040]  for their purpose.
[3:04:07.040 --> 3:04:14.000]  96% false positives, German court, John Hopkins takes down articles showing U.S. deaths 2020
[3:04:14.000 --> 3:04:15.600]  no different than prior years.
[3:04:15.600 --> 3:04:18.920]  They've exaggerated COVID thousands of percentiles.
[3:04:18.920 --> 3:04:25.240]  Top pathologist says coronavirus is the greatest hugs ever portrayed on suspecting public.
[3:04:25.240 --> 3:04:28.640]  But meanwhile, the U.N. officials say life will never go back to normal.
[3:04:28.640 --> 3:04:30.360]  We're never taking the mask off.
[3:04:30.360 --> 3:04:31.360]  It's over.
[3:04:31.360 --> 3:04:38.120]  British military to informed the public via psych warfare, British Army's information
[3:04:38.120 --> 3:04:43.720]  warfare unit will be deployed to tackle anti-vax propaganda.
[3:04:43.720 --> 3:04:49.440]  What propaganda like South Korea resumes flu shots as deaths following vaccination rise
[3:04:49.440 --> 3:04:53.320]  to 59 Newsweek.
[3:04:53.320 --> 3:04:58.960]  What about how they're having thousands of kids with narcolepsy from the flu shot in
[3:04:58.960 --> 3:05:04.640]  Sweden, narcolepsy, fiasco spurs, COVID vaccine fears in Sweden.
[3:05:04.640 --> 3:05:07.760]  They're not going to be able to cover this up in RK.
[3:05:07.760 --> 3:05:11.720]  What do you think's really behind trying to lock us down, trying to hurt us, admitting
[3:05:11.720 --> 3:05:13.800]  the vaccines are going to hurt us?
[3:05:13.800 --> 3:05:15.520]  Are they just setting the present to kill us?
[3:05:15.520 --> 3:05:19.360]  Oh, no, Alex, all those all those articles that you just read out of they're all conspiracy
[3:05:19.360 --> 3:05:20.360]  theories.
[3:05:20.360 --> 3:05:21.480]  They're all they're all conspiracy theories.
[3:05:21.480 --> 3:05:25.200]  None of them are true, none of them have any facts.
[3:05:25.200 --> 3:05:30.000]  And that's what they want you to believe.
[3:05:30.000 --> 3:05:31.320]  It's a way to control us.
[3:05:31.320 --> 3:05:35.040]  It's a way to rig this election.
[3:05:35.040 --> 3:05:39.360]  It's a way to prepare for the future.
[3:05:39.360 --> 3:05:40.600]  Prepare for these lockdowns.
[3:05:40.600 --> 3:05:41.600]  Prepare for the gulags.
[3:05:41.600 --> 3:05:42.600]  Okay.
[3:05:42.600 --> 3:05:46.840]  Because they are, I'm not, this isn't a conspiracy theory.
[3:05:46.840 --> 3:05:50.600]  Proud boys, if Biden gets elected, we are going to be public enemy number one.
[3:05:50.600 --> 3:05:51.920]  We will be targets.
[3:05:51.920 --> 3:05:55.200]  It is a campaign promise of his Kamala Harris has come out.
[3:05:55.200 --> 3:05:57.360]  I mean, the perfect, the perfect storm.
[3:05:57.360 --> 3:06:03.120]  He picks Kamala Harris as a VP that she's going to be the queen of the gulags, right?
[3:06:03.120 --> 3:06:07.520]  If Biden, if they don't use a 25th amendment on Biden beforehand and put an enact Kamala
[3:06:07.520 --> 3:06:10.400]  Harris, which is going to be 10 times worse.
[3:06:10.400 --> 3:06:15.960]  But this is them preparing this, them for preparing to put us in prison, like they did
[3:06:15.960 --> 3:06:20.440]  to Roger Stone, like they did to General Flynn, like they attempted to do to both of
[3:06:20.440 --> 3:06:21.440]  them.
[3:06:21.440 --> 3:06:24.600]  And we had a president that went and stood up for, and we need him to stand up for us
[3:06:24.600 --> 3:06:25.600]  now.
[3:06:25.600 --> 3:06:26.600]  You're damn right.
[3:06:26.600 --> 3:06:27.600]  All right.
[3:06:27.600 --> 3:06:28.600]  God bless you, my friend.
[3:06:28.600 --> 3:06:29.600]  I hope you're coming back on the war room.
[3:06:29.600 --> 3:06:31.320]  If not, be sure and join me tomorrow.
[3:06:31.320 --> 3:06:32.320]  War room's coming up.
[3:06:32.320 --> 3:06:36.280]  But first, Gerald Salente, I'm Alex Jones with infowars.com.
[3:06:36.280 --> 3:06:40.360]  Please share that URL while you still can.
[3:06:40.360 --> 3:06:46.200]  You can watch a factory of robots being controlled by wireless internet commands.
[3:06:46.200 --> 3:06:51.080]  But if you were a person just 200 years ago and you saw that, you'd think it was magic.
[3:06:51.080 --> 3:06:55.320]  You wouldn't even know really what the machines were or what was controlling them.
[3:06:55.320 --> 3:07:00.000]  So for that person, it would be spiritual or it would be something of a spirit.
[3:07:00.000 --> 3:07:04.320]  And it's similar to how ducks and butterflies and many other species of animal, they'll
[3:07:04.320 --> 3:07:08.160]  have to fly thousands and thousands of miles back to the exact place where they were born.
[3:07:08.160 --> 3:07:12.760]  They're following magnetic lines, they have magnetic cells in their brains, we now know
[3:07:12.760 --> 3:07:13.760]  side of what's going on.
[3:07:13.760 --> 3:07:14.760]  There's been a lot more than that.
[3:07:14.760 --> 3:07:19.640]  So when we talk about the spirit, we're talking about all the dark matter, we're talking about
[3:07:19.640 --> 3:07:21.640]  all the things you don't understand but we know it's there.
[3:07:21.640 --> 3:07:26.080]  And just like you can have a bunch of robots working off the wireless system, that's what's
[3:07:26.080 --> 3:07:32.040]  going on with this satanic transmission that's working through people and that's how this
[3:07:32.040 --> 3:07:36.520]  entity behind it all is able to direct it because it is a consciousness manipulated
[3:07:36.520 --> 3:07:39.040]  in the space time continuum.
[3:07:39.040 --> 3:07:43.080]  It's time to show them what a real alpha male looks like with one of our most powerful

[3:08:30.320 --> 3:08:42.480]  Head to infowarstore.com today.
[3:08:42.480 --> 3:08:56.320]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[3:08:56.320 --> 3:09:23.040]  Hey, thanks for having me on, the Alex Jones show, great being on.
[3:09:23.040 --> 3:09:27.680]  And I've said this before and I'm going to keep saying it, you better get hip to the
[3:09:27.680 --> 3:09:33.440]  jive because this thing is going down big time.
[3:09:33.440 --> 3:09:39.440]  Our rights are being robbed right in front of our eyes like nobody could ever imagine
[3:09:39.440 --> 3:09:42.400]  in world history.
[3:09:42.400 --> 3:09:51.440]  Look at the little low life freaks running and ruining our lives.
[3:09:51.440 --> 3:09:55.080]  One after another.
[3:09:55.080 --> 3:09:57.160]  Making up this stuff.
[3:09:57.160 --> 3:09:58.160]  Facts don't count.
[3:09:58.160 --> 3:10:02.240]  Oh, the cases are going up, the cases are going up.
[3:10:02.240 --> 3:10:03.240]  Why are they going up?
[3:10:03.240 --> 3:10:10.080]  Because more people are freaking out and getting tested and you know you hear it on info wars
[3:10:10.080 --> 3:10:15.880]  that these tests are inaccurate in the PCR tests.
[3:10:15.880 --> 3:10:24.120]  So, I want to go over some things that just came out.
[3:10:24.120 --> 3:10:30.600]  This is, I want to give you an example of why you need to support alternative media.
[3:10:30.600 --> 3:10:35.560]  They call it alternative media, that's a wrong word for it.
[3:10:35.560 --> 3:10:41.640]  I would call it open-minded media because this is closed-minded crap.
[3:10:41.640 --> 3:10:51.440]  This is from the Sundays a week ago, New York Times.
[3:10:51.440 --> 3:10:55.800]  This is what they call their business section, all right?
[3:10:55.800 --> 3:10:56.800]  You see that?
[3:10:56.800 --> 3:11:02.560]  Look at that stupid picture up here, the stupid piece of artwork.
[3:11:02.560 --> 3:11:03.560]  What is it?
[3:11:03.560 --> 3:11:08.200]  I'm buying this thing, I want to learn about what's going on in the world business-wise.
[3:11:08.200 --> 3:11:22.040]  Partners in misinformation, the American far-right and critics of China are pushing unsubstantiated
[3:11:22.040 --> 3:11:24.080]  pandemic claims.
[3:11:24.080 --> 3:11:30.320]  I unsubstantiated only what they substantiate counts.
[3:11:30.320 --> 3:11:40.960]  So that's it and then the next story is tripped up an airline, tripped up an airline, its
[3:11:40.960 --> 3:11:43.360]  contractors fell too.
[3:11:43.360 --> 3:11:45.200]  That's not going to help you with anything.
[3:11:45.200 --> 3:11:48.920]  Then you go inside and what do you have?
[3:11:48.920 --> 3:12:06.560]  An empty page of nothing, an ad for fidelity and you go to the next page.
[3:12:06.560 --> 3:12:17.640]  Another stupid cartoon over here, a whole page and then at Wharton a new leader confronts
[3:12:17.640 --> 3:12:19.000]  the culture wars.
[3:12:19.000 --> 3:12:25.680]  Now let me get this straight, I'm buying this thing to get business information.
[3:12:25.680 --> 3:12:29.640]  You haven't told me anything yet.
[3:12:29.640 --> 3:12:41.520]  A cartoon about Turkey talk at Wharton a new leader confronts the culture wars and then
[3:12:41.520 --> 3:12:48.880]  a partnership in coronavirus misinformation, all these stupid pictures over here.
[3:12:48.880 --> 3:12:54.720]  Look at this, dumb.
[3:12:54.720 --> 3:13:01.840]  And then you go to the next page and more pictures of nothing, COVID tripped an airline,
[3:13:01.840 --> 3:13:03.960]  others fell too.
[3:13:03.960 --> 3:13:05.760]  What have I learned?
[3:13:05.760 --> 3:13:07.000]  Nothing?
[3:13:07.000 --> 3:13:14.560]  I think this thing costs about five bucks to buy so that's why you need to support info
[3:13:14.560 --> 3:13:19.200]  wars if you want to know what's going to happen in the world, the trends journal, we tell
[3:13:19.200 --> 3:13:23.880]  you what's going on, what it means and what's next because they're feeding us nothing but
[3:13:23.880 --> 3:13:28.200]  garbage and they promote the garbage men.
[3:13:28.200 --> 3:13:33.640]  How about that little arrogant boy we got over here in New York, the daddy's boy Andy
[3:13:33.640 --> 3:13:36.240]  Cuomo.
[3:13:36.240 --> 3:13:43.280]  They're telling everybody don't you shouldn't have spent Thanksgiving with 91, be alone,
[3:13:43.280 --> 3:13:51.560]  stay home, stay home, lock down, lock down Cuomo says it's shocking, most coronavirus
[3:13:51.560 --> 3:13:58.160]  hospitalizations are people who had been staying home, all right?
[3:13:58.160 --> 3:14:05.920]  That's a May 6th, it shows that 66% of new admissions are from people who had largely
[3:14:05.920 --> 3:14:11.520]  been sheltering at home, not a nice word sheltering at home, how's that for a good
[3:14:11.520 --> 3:14:20.960]  commie phrase, sheltering at home, all right, there it is, they're not making this stuff
[3:14:20.960 --> 3:14:27.960]  up and now they're all telling us to do more, to do more and you got that clown down there
[3:14:27.960 --> 3:14:35.880]  in El Paso, the mayor of a Texas city hit hard by the recent spike in coronavirus cases
[3:14:35.880 --> 3:14:47.840]  says the blame could be pointed at COVID fatigue and that many cases are coming from shopping
[3:14:47.840 --> 3:14:50.040]  at large retailers.
[3:14:50.040 --> 3:15:00.280]  Oh, you mean the bigs that are the essentials, the essentials that we allow to go to the
[3:15:00.280 --> 3:15:08.520]  essentials, the Walmart's and the targets, why you put all the little businesses out
[3:15:08.520 --> 3:15:17.240]  of business, another clown, another arrogant little boy, because hey, don't you have to
[3:15:17.240 --> 3:15:27.600]  wear face masks over there, dumbbell, a fat mouth moron shooting off your big fat mouth,
[3:15:27.600 --> 3:15:33.440]  making everybody wear masks, and now you're blowing out this crap out of your new, you
[3:15:33.440 --> 3:15:44.320]  know what, telling everybody that, oh, what a disgusting, disgusting crap heads that told
[3:15:44.320 --> 3:15:50.600]  face to nation, what face to nation, face to prostitute that's giving you the crap that
[3:15:50.600 --> 3:15:56.920]  you're talking to, that you only get on these shows if you're a low life piece of crap that
[3:15:56.920 --> 3:16:00.080]  sucks up to their garbage.
[3:16:00.080 --> 3:16:08.880]  He said to them on Sunday that I think people, just the consensus is people just had COVID
[3:16:08.880 --> 3:16:13.480]  fatigue and they let down.
[3:16:13.480 --> 3:16:21.200]  You got to wear the mask and you got to maintain the distancing and you got to avoid crowds.
[3:16:21.200 --> 3:16:31.560]  Margo told face to nation, Margo, how about cut zone, Margo, no brain, Margo, look at
[3:16:31.560 --> 3:16:35.720]  the little jerk.
[3:16:35.720 --> 3:16:40.240]  We did a deep dive into our contact tracing, yeah, we've been following you, we've been
[3:16:40.240 --> 3:16:47.640]  following everything you've been doing, or the week of November 10th through the 16th
[3:16:47.640 --> 3:16:52.840]  and found that 55% of the positive casings, which mean absolutely nothing, but he doesn't
[3:16:52.840 --> 3:16:53.840]  say that.
[3:16:53.840 --> 3:16:59.840]  We're coming from shopping at large retailers, what we term is big box stores that we call
[3:16:59.840 --> 3:17:00.840]  essential.
[3:17:00.840 --> 3:17:08.560]  Hey, hey crap head, if every guy you've got to wear, the stupid mask that's supposed
[3:17:08.560 --> 3:17:13.800]  to save your life, how come the numbers went up?
[3:17:13.800 --> 3:17:19.120]  There are all the little prostitutes asking, I'm going to be a jerk on TV and talk like
[3:17:19.120 --> 3:17:23.720]  another one of those clowns with nobody around them, they wear this junk.
[3:17:23.720 --> 3:17:27.840]  I won't wear these, I don't go out anymore.
[3:17:27.840 --> 3:17:33.160]  So do what you can to support infowars, put your money where your heart and mind are because
[3:17:33.160 --> 3:17:35.960]  this thing's coming down.
[3:17:35.960 --> 3:17:44.960]  Warning, warning, warning, there is not long to stop the complete martial law takeover.
[3:17:44.960 --> 3:17:49.360]  The giant third world collapse and a new world war that is going to be triggered by the new
[3:17:49.360 --> 3:17:54.960]  COVID lockdown announced by globalist systems in Europe, in Asia, and now in the United
[3:17:54.960 --> 3:17:55.960]  States.
[3:17:55.960 --> 3:18:02.000]  Joe Biden is set to announce today that he has a new COVID task force that is calling
[3:18:02.000 --> 3:18:07.640]  for a national mask mandate to prove your servitude, contact tracing, forced inoculations
[3:18:07.640 --> 3:18:12.000]  coming, but most importantly, a new lockdown.
[3:18:12.000 --> 3:18:16.920]  That way he can say that Trump is to blame for COVID and claim that only a new lockdown
[3:18:16.920 --> 3:18:18.440]  will stop COVID.
[3:18:18.440 --> 3:18:23.080]  Then of course, when that new lockdown doesn't work, those of us that didn't submit to the
[3:18:23.080 --> 3:18:25.200]  lockdown are going to be blamed for it.
[3:18:25.200 --> 3:18:28.880]  And that's when all the mass arrests start sometime towards the end of next year.
[3:18:28.880 --> 3:18:32.120]  This is a permanent martial law plan.
[3:18:32.120 --> 3:18:36.440]  Trump must be putiated, exposed, vouching gates, and the UN takeover, not play games
[3:18:36.440 --> 3:18:38.080]  with it.
[3:18:38.080 --> 3:18:42.400]  The trick that social engineers use is very, very simple.
[3:18:42.400 --> 3:18:48.960]  They just teach us that the architecture of civilization, that the trajectory of a species
[3:18:48.960 --> 3:18:55.120]  is designed by these ever-knowing, loving, liberal technocrats, and that if we just sit
[3:18:55.120 --> 3:18:58.960]  back and enjoy the ride, everything will be great, but then they tell us that humans
[3:18:58.960 --> 3:19:03.040]  are obsolete, not essential, and we're bad to the earth, and we need to be phased out.
[3:19:03.040 --> 3:19:09.560]  So they're very open about what they're doing, and they count on us just being very passive
[3:19:09.560 --> 3:19:13.920]  living in the matrix-like system that they're building.
[3:19:13.920 --> 3:19:19.040]  But what defines humans more than anything from the rest of the, quote, animal kingdom
[3:19:19.040 --> 3:19:24.520]  is that we control our environment, we build our own environments, we create our own systems,
[3:19:24.520 --> 3:19:31.480]  we really geo-engineer and terraform the planet, and it systems towards our aims, but instead
[3:19:31.480 --> 3:19:35.600]  we're acting like animals, and the globalists play the part of humans, and us is cattle,
[3:19:35.600 --> 3:19:37.440]  and that's the trick.
[3:19:37.440 --> 3:19:40.440]  The Great Reset, where have I heard of that before?
[3:19:40.440 --> 3:19:47.920]  Oh, the Great Leap Forward, Mao Zedong, ordering all the small towns and small farms to basically
[3:19:47.920 --> 3:19:52.520]  shut down and have the rural people and the small business people move into the big cities
[3:19:52.520 --> 3:19:55.440]  and go under communist, commune control.
[3:19:55.440 --> 3:19:56.440]  And that's all this is.
[3:19:56.440 --> 3:19:59.600]  The big mega banks want to break us into the same ones that put Mao Zedong into power,
[3:19:59.600 --> 3:20:02.760]  and they're creating the process of getting rid of our old economy and bringing in the
[3:20:02.760 --> 3:20:07.840]  new economy where everything's free, because when you're a prisoner, well, everything's
[3:20:07.840 --> 3:20:09.520]  free, but you're also a slave.
[3:20:09.520 --> 3:20:14.640]  Scotland is going to have universal guaranteed incomes now of subsistence level, but of course
[3:20:14.640 --> 3:20:18.800]  you've got to take those vaccines, you can't have any kids, and oh, don't worry though,
[3:20:18.800 --> 3:20:22.880]  all of the tampons and stuff like that's free too as well.
[3:20:22.880 --> 3:20:23.880]  I'm not kidding.
[3:20:23.880 --> 3:20:27.640]  So they give you some free paper, they give you enough money to basically live in a tiny
[3:20:27.640 --> 3:20:30.440]  apartment, but they own you, they control you.
[3:20:30.440 --> 3:20:31.440]  That's the Great Reset.
[3:20:31.440 --> 3:20:59.360]  That's why it's got to be resisted to total takeover and we're fighting it at infowars.com.
[3:20:59.360 --> 3:21:06.720]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show and now your host, Gerald Salente.
[3:21:06.720 --> 3:21:08.800]  Hello, hello.
[3:21:08.800 --> 3:21:13.440]  Great to be here on the Alex Jones show.
[3:21:13.440 --> 3:21:17.080]  Yep, they're going to force us to get vaccinated.
[3:21:17.080 --> 3:21:21.520]  We got to listen to the low lives leading us.
[3:21:21.520 --> 3:21:28.840]  One jerk after another, gruesome, nuisance, the fraudulent clown over there in California
[3:21:28.840 --> 3:21:34.640]  that gets caught with his buddies, with the lobbyists, and the other suck ups that they
[3:21:34.640 --> 3:21:40.160]  bend over for to get money from at the French Laundry Napa Valley, remember that two weeks
[3:21:40.160 --> 3:21:46.600]  ago, a week and a half ago, no social distancing, all sitting around a table while they give
[3:21:46.600 --> 3:21:53.280]  more orders the next day for the plantation workers of slave land here to obey while they
[3:21:53.280 --> 3:21:54.280]  break them.
[3:21:54.280 --> 3:22:03.160]  And when look at the head of health over there in California and Los Angeles, oh yeah, when
[3:22:03.160 --> 3:22:08.440]  they just shut down the place, oh yeah, that's a healthy human being she is.
[3:22:08.440 --> 3:22:17.040]  And what does she weigh, about 95 pounds, Ferrara, Ferrara, whatever her name is.
[3:22:17.040 --> 3:22:27.000]  And then you look at the one over the left over there, the his or the her.
[3:22:27.000 --> 3:22:28.000]  What's her name over there?
[3:22:28.000 --> 3:22:29.160]  Yeah, that's the one from California.
[3:22:29.160 --> 3:22:31.600]  Oh yeah, I'm going to take health advice from her.
[3:22:31.600 --> 3:22:34.040]  I mean, you can't make this up.
[3:22:34.040 --> 3:22:35.560]  This is like ghost town.
[3:22:35.560 --> 3:22:39.800]  Oh yeah, she, oh, and there he is, or she is, got to be right.
[3:22:39.800 --> 3:22:46.280]  Can't, what's this guy, Rachel Levine, oh, he, she got in a fight with a reporter because
[3:22:46.280 --> 3:22:52.400]  the reporter called her him, sir, and I'm taking, I'm taking, I'm listening to these
[3:22:52.400 --> 3:22:53.400]  people.
[3:22:53.400 --> 3:22:59.440]  Then he got that other clown running Chicago over there, light head, light foot, light
[3:22:59.440 --> 3:23:00.440]  brain.
[3:23:00.440 --> 3:23:04.840]  Oh yeah, yeah, there she is, there she is over there.
[3:23:04.840 --> 3:23:10.120]  No, not that, the other one, yeah, give it, she's just taking it, there she is.
[3:23:10.120 --> 3:23:12.960]  Now there's someone that I should listen to.
[3:23:12.960 --> 3:23:21.920]  Why wouldn't I be a low life piece of stupid garbage, moron crap to suck up their junk
[3:23:21.920 --> 3:23:24.040]  that they're spitting out?
[3:23:24.040 --> 3:23:29.360]  Look at the freak show, look at the freak show, who's your favorite freak?
[3:23:29.360 --> 3:23:32.480]  Who's your favorite freak?
[3:23:32.480 --> 3:23:38.000]  Look at them, and there's that Cuomo, that shows you how low lives, the low lives are.
[3:23:38.000 --> 3:23:46.280]  Oh, he's gonna win an Emmy for spewing out more crap than anybody with a great crap face.
[3:23:46.280 --> 3:23:50.600]  I'm telling you, you, we, we have to unite.
[3:23:50.600 --> 3:23:56.480]  This thing's going down in front of our eyes and look at that arrogant boy, a little daddy's
[3:23:56.480 --> 3:24:03.200]  boy with his brother, daddy boy on the Cartoon News Network, born on third base, thought
[3:24:03.200 --> 3:24:10.960]  they had a home run and telling you what to do, support Infowars, buy their products,
[3:24:10.960 --> 3:24:16.920]  yeah, that mask is really working well, yeah, phony.
[3:24:16.920 --> 3:24:20.040]  And of course, the Trends Journal, if you want to know what's going on and what's going
[3:24:20.040 --> 3:24:21.480]  on, look at the markets today.
[3:24:21.480 --> 3:24:28.320]  Oh yeah, the markets are down, but gold is down too, they're pushing gold down intentionally.
[3:24:28.320 --> 3:24:35.120]  And that's not a lie, it's a fact, because the JP Morgan Chase Gang got caught rigging
[3:24:35.120 --> 3:24:40.400]  the precious metals market when they got a slap on the wrist and only had to pay $900
[3:24:40.400 --> 3:24:47.240]  million after they shifted people out of hundreds of billions and what they invested over the
[3:24:47.240 --> 3:24:49.240]  years by rigging it.
[3:24:49.240 --> 3:24:54.520]  So long term, I'm still forecasting gold to go way over $2,000 an ounce.
[3:24:54.520 --> 3:25:00.240]  And as you know, I said Bitcoin would take off back in June, and now we saw a pullback
[3:25:00.240 --> 3:25:05.560]  in Bitcoin, but now it's back bounced up, it's back over $19,000.
[3:25:05.560 --> 3:25:11.800]  We said it was going to go up when it was at between $10,000 and $12,000.
[3:25:11.800 --> 3:25:16.600]  Silver's down too, but I still see silver going up because this whole thing is going
[3:25:16.600 --> 3:25:20.320]  down big, big time.
[3:25:20.320 --> 3:25:28.520]  It's one after another, IMF warned that the Eurozone's economic recovery was on the threat
[3:25:28.520 --> 3:25:32.240]  from the ongoing second wave of the coronavirus infections.
[3:25:32.240 --> 3:25:34.440]  This is out just now.
[3:25:34.440 --> 3:25:44.720]  No, it's not the ongoing second wave of coronavirus infections, your low life prostitutes who write
[3:25:44.720 --> 3:25:53.480]  it like that, it's because of the slimy politicians that have destroyed the lives of hundreds
[3:25:53.480 --> 3:26:01.480]  of millions of people and millions of businesses by locking them down with made up rules.
[3:26:01.480 --> 3:26:09.080]  Again, that little jerk from El Paso that's blaming it on everybody going to the big stores,
[3:26:09.080 --> 3:26:14.840]  you're the clowns that made the rule that all the little businesses go out of business
[3:26:14.840 --> 3:26:20.960]  and you only could go to the big businesses.
[3:26:20.960 --> 3:26:22.960]  Where's your mask?
[3:26:22.960 --> 3:26:26.000]  Where's your mask?
[3:26:26.000 --> 3:26:27.000]  Everybody's wearing masks.
[3:26:27.000 --> 3:26:34.600]  How does he get the virus?
[3:26:34.600 --> 3:26:44.600]  And you know, the IMF, the International Mafia Monetary Fund, it's a woman that's running
[3:26:44.600 --> 3:26:52.440]  the show over there and she took it over from Christine Lagarde.
[3:26:52.440 --> 3:27:02.360]  And now in the U.S.S.A., the United Soviet States of America, kiss your free, dumb goodbye.
[3:27:02.360 --> 3:27:04.360]  Isn't it great?
[3:27:04.360 --> 3:27:05.360]  Oh, another woman.
[3:27:05.360 --> 3:27:10.840]  Oh, they're bringing a woman in as Treasury Secretary, Janet Yellen.
[3:27:10.840 --> 3:27:16.600]  Oh, isn't that great news because that's what the big news is right now.
[3:27:16.600 --> 3:27:17.600]  Here it is.
[3:27:17.600 --> 3:27:26.560]  Janet Yellen picked ahead U.S. Treasury in a first for women if only women were in
[3:27:26.560 --> 3:27:33.480]  charge of the International Mafia Federation.
[3:27:33.480 --> 3:27:35.320]  And where was Janet Yellen?
[3:27:35.320 --> 3:27:42.440]  She was the head of the Banksters Association called the Federal Reserve.
[3:27:42.440 --> 3:27:49.720]  Oh, and how about those other wonderful women like Madeleine, not all that bright?
[3:27:49.720 --> 3:27:59.680]  Yeah, the former, at the time, U.S. head of the United Nations, the United Nations head.
[3:27:59.680 --> 3:28:07.240]  Yeah, telling Janet Yellen on 60 Minutes that the 500,000 Iraqi children under the
[3:28:07.240 --> 3:28:15.520]  age of five that were murdered by Billy Clinton, which Bernie Sanders or your little liberal
[3:28:15.520 --> 3:28:22.480]  supported the sanctions that killed over 500,000 Iraqi children, she said, yeah, it was worth
[3:28:22.480 --> 3:28:23.480]  the price.
[3:28:23.480 --> 3:28:29.880]  Oh, and how about that brilliant woman you got over there in Whittlist, Whitmere over
[3:28:29.880 --> 3:28:38.560]  there in, was it Michigan, the one in New Mexico that locked down everything?
[3:28:38.560 --> 3:28:44.240]  I'm sick of this gender, racist stuff, good and bad comes in all of them.
[3:28:44.240 --> 3:28:46.040]  How much more proof do you need?
[3:28:46.040 --> 3:28:51.400]  There's a freak show in every race, religion and nationality.
[3:28:51.400 --> 3:28:59.120]  Look at what I have to suffer through with a Cuomo and a Fauci and their Italian.
[3:28:59.120 --> 3:29:05.800]  If they were Jewish and I say anything about it, you call me an anti-Semite.
[3:29:05.800 --> 3:29:08.360]  That's how disgusting the whole thing is.
[3:29:08.360 --> 3:29:10.640]  You got to be careful what you say.
[3:29:10.640 --> 3:29:14.080]  You only can say it about the right people at the right time.
[3:29:14.080 --> 3:29:20.640]  Oh, by the way, oh, Biden, Biden hurt his foot playing with his dog.
[3:29:20.640 --> 3:29:23.000]  Oh, yeah, I'm sure he's playing with his dog.
[3:29:23.000 --> 3:29:24.920]  How about he was walking and tripped?
[3:29:24.920 --> 3:29:26.920]  You know, maybe that was it.
[3:29:26.920 --> 3:29:29.040]  Maybe the guy's out of his mind and fell.
[3:29:29.040 --> 3:29:31.640]  No, we're going to make the story up.
[3:29:31.640 --> 3:29:33.960]  He's playing with his puppy dog and he fell.
[3:29:33.960 --> 3:29:39.240]  Oh, yeah, what are they getting ready for Camilla Harris to come in?
[3:29:39.240 --> 3:29:44.120]  Oh, yeah, nothing like Black Woman.
[3:29:44.120 --> 3:29:46.720]  Yeah, who was that one?
[3:29:46.720 --> 3:29:49.200]  The next mushroom cloud, you see?
[3:29:49.200 --> 3:29:51.640]  Yeah, but Condoleezza Rice.
[3:29:51.640 --> 3:29:58.000]  Oh, yeah, selling the COVID war, the COVID war, COVID war, rock war.
[3:29:58.000 --> 3:30:00.400]  It's one war they sell you fear.
[3:30:00.400 --> 3:30:07.040]  Again, people are stupid enough to believe them and slaughtered million Iraqis and destroy
[3:30:07.040 --> 3:30:10.680]  their country based on lies.
[3:30:10.680 --> 3:30:13.680]  Oh, who's the other one?
[3:30:13.680 --> 3:30:14.680]  Susan Rice.
[3:30:14.680 --> 3:30:15.680]  Oh, yeah.
[3:30:15.680 --> 3:30:21.040]  You've got to get rid of that guy, Gaddafi.
[3:30:21.040 --> 3:30:26.080]  You're putting the people against each other and it's working.
[3:30:26.080 --> 3:30:29.040]  They're ruling and we're losing.
[3:30:29.040 --> 3:30:35.760]  Again, put your money where your heart and mind are, support infowars, and supermail
[3:30:35.760 --> 3:30:36.760]  vitality.
[3:30:36.760 --> 3:30:39.760]  Ladies and gentlemen, I hope we can stop the great reset.
[3:30:39.760 --> 3:30:44.920]  That means a globalist imposed worldwide depression to break us and bring us under their control.
[3:30:44.920 --> 3:30:48.960]  Mr. Stated admitted plan, Justin Trudeau's on record, Klaus Schwab, all the different
[3:30:48.960 --> 3:30:53.400]  Democrat mayors, they admit it's clowered in heaven, implode the economy to make us
[3:30:53.400 --> 3:30:54.400]  go to their control.
[3:30:54.400 --> 3:30:58.800]  But if we expose that they're the ones doing it, they go to prison instead of getting total
[3:30:58.800 --> 3:30:59.800]  power and total control.
[3:30:59.800 --> 3:31:04.640]  And there are major uprisings happening across the world during the U.S., thousands of sheriffs
[3:31:04.640 --> 3:31:08.400]  are saying hell no to the lockdowns, people are finally starting to fight back.
[3:31:08.400 --> 3:31:10.560]  But regardless, you need to get prepared.
[3:31:10.560 --> 3:31:15.520]  We have high quality, swarable food last 25 years, highest quality, lowest prices, great
[3:31:15.520 --> 3:31:19.560]  containers ready to ship, but when people figure this out in a few months, I think they'll
[3:31:19.560 --> 3:31:23.800]  be long lines again to get swarable food after the lockdown has been going for a few months.
[3:31:23.800 --> 3:31:29.440]  So get your orders in today at PrepareWithAlex.com, you get an additional 10% off and they're

[3:31:34.520 --> 3:31:36.560]  now, PrepareWithAlex.com.
[3:31:36.560 --> 3:31:41.720]  There is an economic war taking place of the ruling class to consolidate power and control.
[3:31:41.720 --> 3:31:45.800]  There's a headline out from Zero Heads that breaks down Bloomberg numbers that global
[3:31:45.800 --> 3:31:51.720]  airlines are set to lose $157 billion this year by the end of December.
[3:31:51.720 --> 3:31:55.400]  It's already over $130 billion they've lost.
[3:31:55.400 --> 3:32:01.240]  Why would they take part in the hoax, in the lockdown, in the hysteria if it hurts them?
[3:32:01.240 --> 3:32:02.240]  We'll see.
[3:32:02.240 --> 3:32:04.960]  That'll knock out all the small airlines and consolidate control, and it's the same
[3:32:04.960 --> 3:32:09.040]  in every single industry, and the big megabanks have unlimited capital.
[3:32:09.040 --> 3:32:12.520]  They want to bankrupt the world economy until they buy it up.
[3:32:12.520 --> 3:32:16.240]  For pennies on the dollar, that's why the great stock market crash of 29 later turned
[3:32:16.240 --> 3:32:18.240]  out was engineered by some central banks.
[3:32:18.240 --> 3:32:21.320]  This is how the global estate control.
[3:32:21.320 --> 3:32:26.400]  It stars the third world to death, makes the first world poor, gives economic warfare,
[3:32:26.400 --> 3:32:30.680]  and it gives cover to the big megabanks that created thousands of trillions of dollars
[3:32:30.680 --> 3:32:32.320]  in fake derivatives.
[3:32:32.320 --> 3:32:37.800]  Only the truth will set us free in FullWars.com.
[3:32:37.800 --> 3:32:43.840]  Back in 1996, the head of the World Food Program said that they would use food and
[3:32:43.840 --> 3:32:49.240]  global lockdowns due to a virus scare to bring in world government.
[3:32:49.240 --> 3:32:53.440]  That also came out in the North American Union Documents, the Judicial Watch, and Lou Dobbs
[3:32:53.440 --> 3:32:58.080]  got more than 15 years ago as well, so we know their plan, and if they're able to keep
[3:32:58.080 --> 3:33:02.400]  this lockdown going, it's going to cause not just a worldwide depression, but mass starvation
[3:33:02.400 --> 3:33:06.880]  of hundreds of millions, millions have already starved to death, not from COVID, but from
[3:33:06.880 --> 3:33:07.880]  the lockdown.
[3:33:07.880 --> 3:33:12.040]  That's why it's important for people in North America to get prepared for all over the
[3:33:12.040 --> 3:33:13.040]  world.
[3:33:13.040 --> 3:33:17.080]  But we have high-quality, swarble food, ready to ship to you the last 25 years, and prepare

[3:34:12.200 --> 3:34:13.200]  to stop it.

[3:34:16.600 --> 3:34:21.560]  them, have the app, and then tell others about it so they can get the app.

[3:35:50.120 --> 3:35:51.120]  a patriot.
[3:35:51.120 --> 3:35:52.520]  Yeah, you know, you could do Biden.
[3:35:52.520 --> 3:35:55.520]  Yeah, maybe you wear a mask, and that's why you fell.

[3:37:47.400 --> 3:37:52.080]  Another Anthony Frieda work of art masterpiece.
[3:37:52.080 --> 3:37:55.160]  And you know, go back in what's going on now.
[3:37:55.160 --> 3:38:03.080]  I mentioned about Yellen becoming the head of the treasury secretary, the head of the
[3:38:03.080 --> 3:38:06.280]  treasury, the secretary of the treasury.
[3:38:06.280 --> 3:38:08.460]  This is an outrage.
[3:38:08.460 --> 3:38:13.000]  We have just put the central bank right in power in front of us.
[3:38:13.000 --> 3:38:16.600]  She was the head of the Federal Reserve.
[3:38:16.600 --> 3:38:21.240]  And now she's going to be our secretary of treasury.
[3:38:21.240 --> 3:38:23.440]  You got it, everybody.
[3:38:23.440 --> 3:38:29.280]  The banksters are in full control.
[3:38:29.280 --> 3:38:31.720]  What Biden administration?
[3:38:31.720 --> 3:38:36.320]  The ministry of Barack Obama, Bankster administration.
[3:38:36.320 --> 3:38:41.480]  Oh, you remember that other guy, Eric Holder.
[3:38:41.480 --> 3:38:44.080]  Oh, yeah.
[3:38:44.080 --> 3:38:46.600]  You remember him?
[3:38:46.600 --> 3:38:54.360]  He was the attorney general under Obama and all those banksters that destroyed the lives
[3:38:54.360 --> 3:39:00.520]  of tens of millions of Americans through a man of their homes and then bought the homes
[3:39:00.520 --> 3:39:02.080]  up and now they rent them out.
[3:39:02.080 --> 3:39:04.640]  They became, you know, these big companies.
[3:39:04.640 --> 3:39:08.520]  Oh, they were too big to jail.
[3:39:08.520 --> 3:39:14.920]  Yeah, too big to jail.
[3:39:14.920 --> 3:39:15.920]  Eric Holder.
[3:39:15.920 --> 3:39:21.120]  Oh, now, oh, black guy, now he's back with the white shoe boy firm over there on, yeah,
[3:39:21.120 --> 3:39:22.720]  Wall Street.
[3:39:22.720 --> 3:39:29.960]  I'm tired of them peddling racism and sexism when good and bad comes into all of it.
[3:39:29.960 --> 3:39:32.120]  And it's not a racist nation.
[3:39:32.120 --> 3:39:37.080]  A racist nation does not elect a black president.
[3:39:37.080 --> 3:39:40.800]  And don't email me and say he's only a half white, you know, half black.
[3:39:40.800 --> 3:39:43.280]  I don't want to hear it.
[3:39:43.280 --> 3:39:47.120]  Oh, he was going to be the savior.
[3:39:47.120 --> 3:39:52.760]  So going back to the board, Janet Yellenin, all right, could it be any clearer than that?
[3:39:52.760 --> 3:39:55.880]  How they're robbing us of our lives?
[3:39:55.880 --> 3:40:06.720]  The banksters are in charge, all the bigs with the essentials, the Walmarts, the targets,
[3:40:06.720 --> 3:40:19.840]  the big box stores, that the clown mayor of El Paso blames the people getting the virus.
[3:40:19.840 --> 3:40:22.320]  And again, nobody talks about the facts.
[3:40:22.320 --> 3:40:27.560]  Why talk about the facts when you could ignore them and you could see who's dying from this
[3:40:27.560 --> 3:40:28.560]  thing and why?
[3:40:28.560 --> 3:40:29.560]  What is it?
[3:40:29.560 --> 3:40:35.880]  Over a hundred thousand people in the United States that have died from this, according
[3:40:35.880 --> 3:40:37.440]  to the, where is it?
[3:40:37.440 --> 3:40:45.680]  The Wall Street Journal came from nursing homes, all right?
[3:40:45.680 --> 3:40:47.200]  And how about obesity?
[3:40:47.200 --> 3:40:54.520]  And went out the other night to a place I couldn't believe these young women and young
[3:40:54.520 --> 3:40:55.520]  guys.
[3:40:55.520 --> 3:41:03.280]  They were like, my God, you think something, you're going to get sick about something?
[3:41:03.280 --> 3:41:13.520]  When you're in that kind of shape, oh, oh, yeah, don't worry, you'll be fine, don't worry
[3:41:13.520 --> 3:41:14.520]  about it.
[3:41:14.520 --> 3:41:15.520]  Everything's going to be great.
[3:41:15.520 --> 3:41:24.160]  And then the other thing, you know, we've got to keep looking at is, yeah, we go, yeah,
[3:41:24.160 --> 3:41:33.360]  Wall Street Journal, not making it up COVID-19 that's top 100,000 in U.S. long-term care facilities.
[3:41:33.360 --> 3:41:34.360]  Okay.
[3:41:34.360 --> 3:41:35.360]  All right.
[3:41:35.360 --> 3:41:36.360]  All right.
[3:41:36.360 --> 3:41:49.680]  It's the elderly, for people one to 20 years old, the recovery rate is 99.997 percent.
[3:41:49.680 --> 3:41:53.480]  Overall is 99.8 percent and 99.7 percent.
[3:41:53.480 --> 3:41:55.800]  You don't close down the global economy for this.
[3:41:55.800 --> 3:41:59.280]  Oh, and how about that Supreme Court ruling, huh?
[3:41:59.280 --> 3:42:01.480]  Wasn't that a great one?
[3:42:01.480 --> 3:42:08.320]  Yeah, if you've got a choice, you could bring all the folks you wanted.
[3:42:08.320 --> 3:42:09.320]  Amen.
[3:42:09.320 --> 3:42:18.640]  Oh, it wouldn't be proper now, hey, women, yeah, hey, you got your ego for the old me,
[3:42:18.640 --> 3:42:23.720]  you go for the amenity, oh, hey, you know, you could be the Rachel guy or a girl.
[3:42:23.720 --> 3:42:25.440]  I can't say who the vine.
[3:42:25.440 --> 3:42:26.440]  Not so fine.
[3:42:26.440 --> 3:42:30.600]  Hey, all that chins on, look at that, look at all the chins on that guy over there.
[3:42:30.600 --> 3:42:35.080]  A woman will ever look at all the chins.
[3:42:35.080 --> 3:42:39.880]  How many chins do you got there and you're telling me about health?
[3:42:39.880 --> 3:42:46.920]  Oh, Gerald Selenki, who has an honorary doctorate from the National University of Health Sciences,
[3:42:46.920 --> 3:42:51.080]  for the work he's done in complementary and integrative medicine.
[3:42:51.080 --> 3:42:56.400]  And the first book he worked on was called Natural Healing or a Warner book.
[3:42:56.400 --> 3:42:59.880]  And I got these clowns telling me what to do.
[3:42:59.880 --> 3:43:06.760]  Come over here man-to-man or woman-to-man and tell me what to do.
[3:43:06.760 --> 3:43:11.960]  So going back to this, so now you could go to church, a congregation, you can have all
[3:43:11.960 --> 3:43:15.840]  the people you want, but not in your restaurant.
[3:43:15.840 --> 3:43:21.240]  We don't care if you go out of business because the bigs are getting bigger and we're going
[3:43:21.240 --> 3:43:24.320]  to take over everything.
[3:43:24.320 --> 3:43:30.880]  You can't go out and have a drink on the ink tank before Thanksgiving, said Rachel Levine,
[3:43:30.880 --> 3:43:34.880]  Levine, not so fine.
[3:43:34.880 --> 3:43:42.320]  Health expert, a bureaucrat, a low-life bureaucrat that sucked their way up to get to where they
[3:43:42.320 --> 3:43:43.320]  are.
[3:43:43.320 --> 3:43:50.160]  Again, look at that one from Los Angeles, a ghost, a ghost of a woman telling us what
[3:43:50.160 --> 3:43:51.160]  to do.
[3:43:51.160 --> 3:43:59.240]  Oh, yeah, she knows, well, you speak, I listen, hey women, I can't say hey men, I want to
[3:43:59.240 --> 3:44:09.400]  make it clear, I like hey women, I like guys, you know, we're friends, hey women, that's
[3:44:09.400 --> 3:44:10.400]  for me.
[3:44:10.400 --> 3:44:15.640]  I guess when those Catholic priests started taking over over there to do all those terrible
[3:44:15.640 --> 3:44:22.200]  things to those boys, and that's when they came with the amen thing, and as a Catholic
[3:44:22.200 --> 3:44:25.040]  I'm disgusted with them.
[3:44:25.040 --> 3:44:31.200]  But anyway, moving on, there's going to be a bounce back in the economy, there's going
[3:44:31.200 --> 3:44:36.440]  to be phony, and we're coming out with our top trends next week, and you're not going
[3:44:36.440 --> 3:44:37.440]  to want to miss them.
[3:44:37.440 --> 3:44:43.040]  It's going to go into the greatest depression, but people are going to be fooled, so you better
[3:44:43.040 --> 3:44:45.920]  prepare for what's going to happen.
[3:44:45.920 --> 3:44:52.840]  Oh, it's coming back, you get vaccinated, everything will be fine, oh, and by the way,
[3:44:52.840 --> 3:45:03.000]  I'm one step away from getting censored on Facebook because I wrote, get back in your
[3:45:03.000 --> 3:45:06.400]  house, get back in your house, you can't go out and play, get back in your house, get
[3:45:06.400 --> 3:45:09.760]  back in your house, I'll tell you where to stay, get back in your house, get back in
[3:45:09.760 --> 3:45:17.000]  your house, you will obey Hile Hitler, can't say that, can't say that, you're banned, and
[3:45:17.000 --> 3:45:23.200]  also I'm getting censored on LinkedIn for saying that we have to stand up and fight
[3:45:23.200 --> 3:45:40.960]  against the freaks that are killing us, so see you next week.
