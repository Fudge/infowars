[00:00.000 --> 00:10.760]  It's Thursday, May 14th, the year is 2020.
[00:10.760 --> 00:19.160]  We're 172 out when the election and the Democrats are openly trying to either cancel it or have
[00:19.160 --> 00:21.800]  mail-in ballots or they're mass fraud.
[00:21.800 --> 00:23.240]  This is the main attack.
[00:23.240 --> 00:27.760]  I told you three weeks ago from internal sources that Trump was going to turn against
[00:27.760 --> 00:30.080]  Fauci, realizing he's a total fraud.
[00:30.080 --> 00:35.240]  We put out a report last weekend at McViral, pointing out that Trump has now sidelined
[00:35.240 --> 00:37.600]  Fauci for fraud.
[00:37.600 --> 00:42.480]  And now Trump is beginning to get to destroy Fauci, who is the villain of the Gates frontman.
[00:42.480 --> 00:48.160]  Here is President Trump opening up on Fauci the fraudster.
[00:48.160 --> 01:05.720]  Look, he wants to play all sides of the equation.
[01:05.720 --> 01:08.440]  I think we're going to have a tremendous fourth quarter.
[01:08.440 --> 01:11.440]  I think we're going to have a transitional third quarter.
[01:11.440 --> 01:13.440]  And I think we're going to have a phenomenal next year.
[01:13.440 --> 01:17.680]  I feel that we are going to have a country that's ready to absolutely have one of its
[01:17.680 --> 01:23.160]  best years, next year with all of the stimulus and all of the fact that it's a pent-up demand
[01:23.160 --> 01:24.640]  like I haven't seen.
[01:24.640 --> 01:27.440]  And you see it right now.
[01:27.440 --> 01:34.840]  These two really professional, good governors that do such a, you know, work so hard.
[01:34.840 --> 01:36.120]  I know both of them very well.
[01:36.120 --> 01:41.160]  One happens to be a Democrat, okay, but we've worked together and I think we've worked together
[01:41.160 --> 01:43.480]  very well.
[01:43.480 --> 01:47.240]  And one, you would expect me to say that, but it happens to be true, okay?
[01:47.240 --> 01:48.880]  Really good job, too.
[01:48.880 --> 01:52.480]  But we've worked very, very well together.
[01:52.480 --> 01:54.400]  They want to get their states open.
[01:54.400 --> 02:00.520]  Some governors and some perhaps partisans, maybe for election reasons, don't want to
[02:00.520 --> 02:02.040]  have their states open.
[02:02.040 --> 02:03.840]  And then some shouldn't open them quite yet.
[02:03.840 --> 02:04.840]  You know, they're not ready.
[02:04.840 --> 02:07.360]  They went through a lot and they're not quite ready.
[02:07.360 --> 02:09.920]  But no, we're opening our country.
[02:09.920 --> 02:10.920]  People want to open.
[02:10.920 --> 02:12.240]  The schools are going to be open.
[02:12.240 --> 02:19.960]  I was seeing the other day, Purdue, great school, great college, university, and Purdue
[02:19.960 --> 02:23.720]  is opening and others are opening and they're all announcing it.
[02:23.720 --> 02:24.720]  These are young people.
[02:24.720 --> 02:26.000]  These are students, young students.
[02:26.000 --> 02:27.360]  They're in great shape.
[02:27.360 --> 02:28.360]  They're in great shape.
[02:28.360 --> 02:33.600]  Now, when you have an incident, one out of a million, one out of 500, that will something
[02:33.600 --> 02:36.160]  happen, perhaps?
[02:36.160 --> 02:41.000]  But you know, you can be driving to school and some bad things can happen, too.
[02:41.000 --> 02:42.720]  So no, we're going to open our country.
[02:42.720 --> 02:43.720]  We want it open.
[02:43.720 --> 02:48.720]  When you say Dr. Fauci is playing both sides, are you suggesting that the advice in the
[02:48.720 --> 02:49.720]  community?
[02:49.720 --> 02:56.280]  Well, I was surprised by his answer, actually, because, you know, it's just, to me, it's
[02:56.280 --> 03:00.840]  not an acceptable answer, especially with...
[03:00.840 --> 03:02.720]  Now let's go ahead and play Fauci.
[03:02.720 --> 03:07.760]  Now, the guy that says we should never shake hands again, that was said by him.
[03:07.760 --> 03:13.960]  Here he is yesterday in his Senate testimony saying that, oh, we can't open the schools
[03:13.960 --> 03:18.880]  up in the fall and the UN now says it's never going to end.
[03:18.880 --> 03:20.280]  Just never going to end.
[03:20.280 --> 03:23.600]  They say that COVID's never going away and we just will never open up again.
[03:23.600 --> 03:25.160]  We'll all just starve to death.
[03:25.160 --> 03:29.080]  That's coming up next segment, even though every virologist will tell you that viruses
[03:29.080 --> 03:30.080]  burn themselves out.
[03:30.080 --> 03:35.000]  But see, this one isn't going to because they're going to count every death forever.
[03:35.000 --> 03:45.080]  Drug attack, car wreck, shotgun wound, drowned, cancer, flu, every death is now COVID, forever.
[03:45.080 --> 03:46.680]  This is the medical dictatorship.
[03:46.680 --> 03:50.960]  This is the UN now our authority telling us which end is up.
[03:50.960 --> 03:51.960]  This is the takeover.
[03:51.960 --> 03:54.480]  Here's Dr. Fraud.
[03:54.480 --> 04:01.440]  Be more in the realm of knowing the landscape of infection with regard to testing and as
[04:01.440 --> 04:06.480]  Admiral Giroir said, it would depend on the dynamics of the outbreak in the region where
[04:06.480 --> 04:07.480]  the school is.
[04:07.480 --> 04:13.720]  But I did not mean to imply at all any relationship between the availability of a vaccine and
[04:13.720 --> 04:16.440]  treatment and our ability to go back to school.
[04:16.440 --> 04:17.440]  You're quite correct.
[04:17.440 --> 04:25.600]  And what I heard from Admiral Giroir was that you're ramping up current technologies.
[04:25.600 --> 04:32.560]  You are hopeful for Dr. Collins' shark tank in the National Institutes of Health.
[04:32.560 --> 04:39.600]  But in any of that, you would expect to have the capacity in the fall of 40 to 50 million
[04:39.600 --> 04:41.440]  tests a month.
[04:41.440 --> 04:45.480]  And that ought to be adequate for the principal of a middle school or even the chancellor of
[04:45.480 --> 04:48.840]  a campus to divine it.
[04:48.840 --> 04:50.360]  So there they are.
[04:50.360 --> 04:52.440]  Can't open up in the fall.
[04:52.440 --> 04:53.440]  Everyone must be tested.
[04:53.440 --> 04:59.920]  The government must test you now for a virus and they give you the vaccine.
[04:59.920 --> 05:05.840]  As I record this announcement, there's only one week left in the biggest sale yet of 2020.
[05:05.840 --> 05:11.880]  We will not have this sale that's coming on right now in May until our Christmas sale
[05:11.880 --> 05:12.880]  comes up.
[05:12.880 --> 05:18.720]  All of our best-selling supplements are 30 to 60 percent off at infowarstore.com.
[05:18.720 --> 05:22.160]  Let me just hone in on one of the products.
[05:22.160 --> 05:24.080]  DNA Force Plus.
[05:24.080 --> 05:29.240]  It's got high-quality PQQ, CoQ10, and a bunch of other natural ingredients that are known
[05:29.240 --> 05:31.680]  to supercharge the effects of that.
[05:31.680 --> 05:37.200]  Learn what PQQ and CoQ10 can do for you no matter how old you are, no matter what color
[05:37.200 --> 05:42.040]  you are, no matter where you live in the world, it works the same on everybody.
[05:42.040 --> 05:44.600]  It's known to be able to regrow nerves.
[05:44.600 --> 05:48.000]  It's designed so that your telomeres last longer.
[05:48.000 --> 05:52.520]  To make them grow, make them shrink slower, which is basically the same thing.
[05:52.520 --> 06:20.880]  DNA Force Plus is 50 percent off for a limited time at infowarstore.com.
[06:20.880 --> 06:26.680]  Ladies and gentlemen, we are 172 days out from the historic election.
[06:26.680 --> 06:31.120]  I'm your host, Alex Jones, and we are going to cover so much incredible news and information
[06:31.120 --> 06:32.920]  today.
[06:32.920 --> 06:39.640]  Now, let me go ahead and lay the news and information out that we're going to be going
[06:39.640 --> 06:41.120]  over today.
[06:41.120 --> 06:49.760]  Yesterday, I spent about 30 minutes on public plans from Lancet, the National Institutes
[06:49.760 --> 06:59.440]  of Health, and the United Nations World Health Organization's own website saying they have
[06:59.440 --> 07:04.880]  developed vaccines to sterilize men and women.
[07:04.880 --> 07:09.400]  And then I showed you articles and reports where they admitted that the UN tested it
[07:09.400 --> 07:15.480]  on unwitting subjects in Central Asia, the Middle East, Africa, and Latin America.
[07:15.480 --> 07:21.040]  Nobody knows about secret testing, secret sterilization, but I showed folks MPR, the
[07:21.040 --> 07:23.840]  London Guardian, admitting it.
[07:23.840 --> 07:28.000]  That was all five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten years ago they were admitting this.
[07:28.000 --> 07:35.080]  Now, Big Pharma has such control over social media, big tech, and the news that there's
[07:35.080 --> 07:38.680]  a total clampdown and a shutdown almost really going on.
[07:38.680 --> 07:44.360]  But we have all the old articles and we have the studies, and it's all still on the United
[07:44.360 --> 07:47.200]  Nations website.
[07:47.200 --> 07:51.440]  So they're going to have a big problem coming out with these vaccines that whistleblowers
[07:51.440 --> 08:04.680]  inside Big Pharma have now exposed are planning to add HCG to the vaccines.
[08:04.680 --> 08:12.520]  And when you take HCG with another pathogen and with an antigen that causes an autoimmune
[08:12.520 --> 08:20.640]  response, the body that has an autoimmune response to HCG, that's only one of more than 20 admitted
[08:20.640 --> 08:27.000]  UN tested sterilant vaccines.
[08:27.000 --> 08:33.960]  But the HCG is the main one because it works real good.
[08:33.960 --> 08:41.080]  And it also screws the women up really, really, really bad.
[08:41.080 --> 08:47.920]  So these trials have been going on since 1985.
[08:47.920 --> 08:56.480]  And again, they did it secretly in India, in Peru, in Mexico, and it killed a lot of
[08:56.480 --> 08:57.480]  the women too.
[08:57.480 --> 09:03.400]  Because when your body starts attacking your ovaries, you have a big old autoimmune response
[09:03.400 --> 09:05.360]  and your body thinks your ovaries are the enemy.
[09:05.360 --> 09:09.480]  Boy, I bet that don't feel too good, does it?
[09:09.480 --> 09:18.320]  I mean, women already start bouncing off the walls when they go into estrus.
[09:18.320 --> 09:21.600]  You imagine what it's like having your body eat your ovaries?
[09:21.600 --> 09:25.840]  Hey, but don't worry, it's not just women that get to enjoy this.
[09:25.840 --> 09:31.760]  Men have got their ovaries on the outside called wavos.
[09:31.760 --> 09:36.440]  And it just so happens, these new vaccines just so happen to attack your testicles as
[09:36.440 --> 09:37.440]  well.
[09:37.440 --> 09:42.040]  Oh, and so does COVID-19.
[09:42.040 --> 09:45.880]  But only if you're completely rundown and don't have a sink.
[09:45.880 --> 09:52.120]  Vitamin D3, vitamin E, vitamin A, you've got to have all those or the cells can't protect
[09:52.120 --> 09:53.120]  themselves.
[09:53.120 --> 09:58.440]  There was a big study out yesterday that, oh, scientists say vitamin D3 basically renders
[09:58.440 --> 10:02.080]  cells invincible.
[10:02.080 --> 10:06.520]  The WHO comes out and says, shut up, don't tell the public that.
[10:06.520 --> 10:11.640]  Such a scientist came out and said, mouthwash is good as a frontline defense to kill the
[10:11.640 --> 10:13.960]  virus once it gets to the mouth to make it stop replicating.
[10:13.960 --> 10:18.120]  And they're like, the UN came down and said, don't you dare say that?
[10:18.120 --> 10:20.600]  There's no hope.
[10:20.600 --> 10:27.920]  The only hope is a vaccine because they want the precedent to test you before you can
[10:27.920 --> 10:29.800]  go back to work or live and to get in your body.
[10:29.800 --> 10:31.200]  And it's in The New York Times today.
[10:31.200 --> 10:34.480]  There's a big article at newswars.com and infowars.com.
[10:34.480 --> 10:39.040]  I apologize for Watson breaking it down and they bemoan the fact that there's all these
[10:39.040 --> 10:45.080]  popular websites and all these people coming out and saying that the vaccine might hurt
[10:45.080 --> 10:50.240]  you and that a sped up vaccine might cause damage and that that shouldn't be allowed.
[10:50.240 --> 10:56.000]  The New York Times says anyone, including medical doctors, warning that a vaccine, especially
[10:56.000 --> 11:01.640]  a rushed vaccine has histories of hurting people, well, they called for anyone saying
[11:01.640 --> 11:04.520]  that to be banned in The New York Times article.
[11:04.520 --> 11:06.200]  Of course, they got a problem.
[11:06.200 --> 11:12.760]  Bill Gates said 700,000 people will get sick and or die with the numbers he's got if they
[11:12.760 --> 11:16.680]  inject everybody on earth with the COVID-19 vaccine they've already got, by the way.
[11:16.680 --> 11:19.240]  Bill and Melinda Gates patented it two years ago.
[11:19.240 --> 11:25.640]  It's a Chimera coronavirus tested at the damn Wuhan lab by Fauci.
[11:25.640 --> 11:35.160]  And of course, the very people involved in all of it, running it, they're now the ones
[11:35.160 --> 11:41.480]  in control of our lives and so let's just pull back here and get the 35,000 foot view.
[11:41.480 --> 11:49.840]  The WHO is funded by a consortium of big pharma and it has established world government where
[11:49.840 --> 11:56.280]  whether you're in Brazil or the United States or the UK or Russia or Japan or China, the
[11:56.280 --> 12:02.920]  WHO is the boss and they set the policy and they set the standards and they tell us when
[12:02.920 --> 12:05.520]  we can go back to work and where we can live.
[12:05.520 --> 12:08.080]  They have a name for that.
[12:08.080 --> 12:15.080]  It's called global government and of course, it's a medical tyranny world government because
[12:15.080 --> 12:19.280]  if the UN showed up with troops, you would say it was illegitimate but if they show up
[12:19.280 --> 12:26.840]  in white lab coats with trillions of dollars of backing behind them, well then you know
[12:26.840 --> 12:28.240]  it's a big problem.
[12:28.240 --> 12:32.560]  Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation has been kicked out of more than 10 countries after
[12:32.560 --> 12:39.000]  they were caught running secret sterilization programs and I've got an entire stack right
[12:39.000 --> 12:44.600]  here where I'm going to go over that from again, mainstream news but no reporting on
[12:44.600 --> 12:46.560]  it in five years.
[12:46.560 --> 12:51.320]  Big pharma came in and bought up the media and there is just dead radio silence on this
[12:51.320 --> 12:57.840]  now because now old Billy Boy and the big robber baron eugenics money behind him is
[12:57.840 --> 13:06.960]  making their move so world government is here and it's tyrannical and it wants the precedent
[13:06.960 --> 13:07.960]  to put things in your body.
[13:07.960 --> 13:13.400]  The New York Times bemoans that upwards of half the people they talk to say they're not
[13:13.400 --> 13:16.560]  going to take the shot over their dead body and it's just terrible and this has got to
[13:16.560 --> 13:21.960]  be silenced and there's all these Instagram stars, all these young people, all these former
[13:21.960 --> 13:30.480]  Democrats are coming out against the forced inoculation and they're posting disinfo and
[13:30.480 --> 13:34.280]  then you see what they're posting, they're linking to medical doctors, they're linking
[13:34.280 --> 13:43.160]  to vaccine inserts, they're linking to sterilization reports, they're linking to reports on Gardasil
[13:43.160 --> 13:49.280]  killing women to take it and they now think they're going to come and forcibly do this
[13:49.280 --> 13:54.920]  and the New York Times goes further, they say we need to start with medical passports
[13:54.920 --> 13:59.240]  which is what Bill Gates has called for, that you can't get on an airplane if you haven't
[13:59.240 --> 14:06.200]  had the COVID-19 and they go on to admit there's going to be mutations so you're going to need
[14:06.200 --> 14:12.640]  a new COVID shot every year but of course it's not going to protect you, it's not going
[14:12.640 --> 14:18.600]  to be the right mutation, there are hundreds of COVID-19 mutations right now and yeah if
[14:18.600 --> 14:22.920]  you're a rundown and you're 85 and you smoke cigarettes most of your life and drink Jack
[14:22.920 --> 14:29.000]  Daniels all day, your body doesn't have defenses and the common cold will kill you but why
[14:29.000 --> 14:31.200]  is COVID man made?
[14:31.200 --> 14:38.160]  So they can own it and when we expose the New York Times saying make them have the shot,
[14:38.160 --> 14:44.000]  make them have an ID or Israel says we're going to make every child starting next year
[14:44.000 --> 14:51.480]  they're proposing an implantable microchip but then they'll have the New York Times saying
[14:51.480 --> 14:57.680]  oh yeah we're going to make everybody take vaccines to travel that'll you know lend credence
[14:57.680 --> 15:02.400]  to their plan that it's forced inoculations but it's still a conspiracy theory so we're
[15:02.400 --> 15:09.520]  coming to do exactly what you would imagine in a nightmare mark of the beast scenario
[15:09.520 --> 15:14.880]  and so the people warning about all this were right but they're still bad you understand.
[15:14.880 --> 15:19.480]  Yes it lends credence to them that we're authoritarians and that this is going to be forced but
[15:19.480 --> 15:26.120]  it's the right thing to do so let's do it.
[15:26.120 --> 15:29.320]  So it's here total authoritarianism because they think you're weak, they think you're
[15:29.320 --> 15:32.640]  stupid, they're making their move on you, you're not weak, you're not stupid.
[15:32.640 --> 15:38.720]  Alright because one thing I gotta tell you the awakening is ultra massive and huge right
[15:38.720 --> 15:45.280]  now it is just so huge and so exciting but people should be waking up because this is
[15:45.280 --> 15:50.600]  a takeover and now everybody I talk to is like you're right Alex the Democrats in deep
[15:50.600 --> 15:57.280]  state are holding the cities and states hostage to kill the economy it's criminal yeah exactly.
[15:57.280 --> 16:02.360]  In mineral fusion is one of our best selling products it wasn't always that way we hardly
[16:02.360 --> 16:06.960]  ever promoted it we first launched it a few years ago but people slowly began to try it
[16:06.960 --> 16:12.160]  and almost everyone that orders it reorders it that's why we're offering it right now
[16:12.160 --> 16:18.680]  at infowarslife.com at 50% off even though we're about to sell out because I want people
[16:18.680 --> 16:22.560]  who've been on the fence who've heard us talk about it who've read some of the reviews
[16:22.560 --> 16:26.440]  to experience it for yourself and this is important it's not just all the key vitamins
[16:26.440 --> 16:31.360]  and minerals you need it's also got amino acids that are known to help you absorb more
[16:31.360 --> 16:36.280]  of this into your body and that's really important for folks that are older because a lot of
[16:36.280 --> 16:42.200]  people don't absorb vitamins and minerals in pill form or caplet form but they get a
[16:42.200 --> 16:47.440]  higher absorption rate when it's liquid so this powdered formula goes great into water
[16:47.440 --> 16:52.000]  into other juices it's good for adults it's good for children take advantage of this super
[16:52.000 --> 16:57.840]  sale that's about to end at infowarslife.com today with vitamin mineral fusion what info

[17:18.880 --> 17:24.960]  the internal operations of the globalists are being externalized you must decide which
[17:24.960 --> 17:31.040]  side you're on living in denial having mastoccom syndrome learned out was that will only deliver
[17:31.040 --> 17:37.080]  you into misery destruction and finally death and this is a spiritual death we're talking
[17:37.080 --> 17:44.240]  about not just a physical death the delusions must end now info wars was correct about it
[17:44.240 --> 17:49.280]  all we have come so far by exposing the enemy most people that are aware of the new order
[17:49.280 --> 17:55.320]  decide to join it out of fear they are truly fools we must fight this or lose our souls
[17:55.320 --> 18:21.640]  you're listening to the alex jones show defending the republic from enemies foreign and domestic
[18:21.640 --> 18:30.120]  it's alex jones welcome back now next segment i'm going to get into this in more detail but let
[18:30.120 --> 18:38.840]  me just set the table with us airline group sees virus hurting travel for at least five years msn
[18:39.880 --> 18:47.800]  us immunologists warns of dark winter if virus rebound says don't ever reopen danish health
[18:47.800 --> 18:53.240]  chief says more corona virus waves very unlikely because the virus has already burned itself out
[18:53.240 --> 18:59.320]  but see they don't care they're gonna call every death again car wreck shark attack electrocution
[19:01.160 --> 19:08.040]  cancer covered 19 that's why it never ends exclusive second more deadly wave of coronavirus
[19:08.040 --> 19:14.280]  to hit europe this winter y'all who knows dc extents stay at home order to june 8th
[19:14.280 --> 19:21.640]  then they'll sit it again and again white house buried cdc plan warning against any summer vacation
[19:21.640 --> 19:30.280]  travel to avoid second wave of infections remember it was flatten the curve now they're in search of
[19:30.280 --> 19:37.080]  a curve because it's depending on the model 50 times lower 40 times lower 30 times lower 10 times
[19:37.080 --> 19:43.560]  lower as they keep adjusting the model so it's this little bump along the bottom but they zoom in on
[19:43.560 --> 19:49.320]  that molehill and say it's just massive why there's been 130 deaths in Dallas
[19:52.200 --> 19:57.320]  and then you realize that there's six million people up there three million in Dallas alone
[19:59.400 --> 20:06.600]  so they keep doing that and now sing oh my gosh there were five in Wuhan five cases
[20:08.280 --> 20:13.400]  meanwhile millions of people are dying every week folks a lot of things and i know you know this but
[20:13.400 --> 20:19.400]  this is all a perception manipulation and i've harped on this because it's so important
[20:21.080 --> 20:28.120]  when jaws came out in 1972 for several years they saw upwards of a 60 percent you can pull
[20:28.120 --> 20:37.480]  this up online there's actual news clippings you just type in um beaches saw less tourism after
[20:37.480 --> 20:42.760]  jaws they had to put billboards up and radio ads and say there's only maybe 10 great white attacks
[20:42.760 --> 20:49.160]  a year worldwide it's very rare it's safe come back to the beach all because people
[20:54.600 --> 20:58.920]  now that is super rare that's like getting struck by lightning twice in your lifetime
[20:58.920 --> 21:01.480]  getting bit by a great white shark i mean it's very rare
[21:03.800 --> 21:07.000]  they gotta think you're a seal they usually grab you spit you out because you don't taste good
[21:07.000 --> 21:14.040]  yeah shark phobia the memory of jaws continues to scare swimmers away from the ocean national
[21:14.040 --> 21:22.520]  post canada so this is real though i mean pneumonia respiratory illnesses in the united
[21:22.520 --> 21:27.160]  states kill about a hundred thousand people a year it's much worse than the flu and they've
[21:27.160 --> 21:31.080]  never been able to come up with a vaccine for it it just doesn't work there's too many viruses
[21:31.080 --> 21:38.680]  you've got to get the cut of the jib exactly right for a vaccine or it's got to be dead on
[21:40.040 --> 21:45.320]  and then it does work if you don't have an autoimmune response get really really sick
[21:45.320 --> 21:49.080]  if you're not allergic to it because the adjuvant is creating an allergic response
[21:49.080 --> 21:52.840]  the heck like oh we don't know why your kid swole up and couldn't breathe it had a seizure
[21:54.600 --> 21:57.640]  they know damn well what's going on it's on the insert it says it
[21:57.640 --> 22:00.840]  okay there's a talk show host attacks me in austin all the time
[22:01.960 --> 22:07.800]  he went and got a flu shot a few years ago and his arms and legs became numb the doctor told him
[22:07.800 --> 22:11.640]  yeah you have gion beret now i didn't get to the point where he couldn't breathe but for a year
[22:11.640 --> 22:19.960]  his hands and feet were numb couldn't feel him he still talks trash about me almost every day i'm
[22:19.960 --> 22:26.280]  told about it dill dudley on ninety three seven fm because that's what keeps him employed by the
[22:26.280 --> 22:30.520]  leftist that own it and it's just sad he tells people go out and get your vaccines because
[22:30.520 --> 22:35.560]  that's what he's told to do even though he got sick from it you talk about not being able to help
[22:35.560 --> 22:44.680]  people but i'm look i'm digressing i'm gonna get into this when we come back actually go over the
[22:44.680 --> 22:48.600]  articles themselves uh let me just throw this in here real fast this is really really important
[22:50.440 --> 22:55.400]  my sales pitches are always honestly what's going on so when i tell you something selling out it means
[22:55.400 --> 23:00.920]  it's really selling out when i tell you something is that 50 off it's 50 off when i tell you something
[23:00.920 --> 23:07.880]  70 off it's 70 off eight pack power stack i thought would be our new super product because
[23:07.880 --> 23:13.480]  market research showed people like ampm packs where you have in the morning and in the evening
[23:14.440 --> 23:21.240]  the packs you take and people get everything they need at one one shot and this was very
[23:21.240 --> 23:29.320]  expensive for us to make this is the highest quality each box of this is very expensive for us to make
[23:29.320 --> 23:33.480]  there are other ones out there where you get a box of this stuff for you know five bucks instead it
[23:33.480 --> 23:39.320]  cost us what like twenty five dollars a box and then you've got all the other expenses the warehouse
[23:39.320 --> 23:45.960]  the crew all of it so when i tell you i'm selling this at cost it's at cost it's 70 off
[23:45.960 --> 23:52.680]  and it's the sleeper product now since i put it on mega sale we went from having a lot of it
[23:52.680 --> 23:56.040]  because they double ordered it too for whatever reason the mistake was made they ordered twice as
[23:56.040 --> 24:03.320]  much as i said to order now we've sold it down to about 30 percent of the stock we have i don't
[24:03.320 --> 24:08.920]  know if i'm going to reorder this again because it was so expensive to make but if you want something
[24:08.920 --> 24:13.080]  for your husband your wife your mom your dad especially the elderly you know for your mom
[24:13.080 --> 24:16.840]  you know for your mom and your dad where they won't forget to take it you've got the a impact you've
[24:16.840 --> 24:22.840]  got the p impact and it's got 13 different capsules of the highest quality everything in here the fish
[24:22.840 --> 24:29.720]  oil the the the multivitamins 13 pills you need to go read about ampm stack this is the best
[24:29.720 --> 24:34.840]  skill we've got and i was talking to the sales guys here today they said yeah we're down to about
[24:34.840 --> 24:39.320]  30 percent of this do you want to reorder it and i said i don't know i'm gonna reorder it but i'm
[24:39.320 --> 24:45.480]  gonna sell it for another week or so at 70 percent off then we're gonna go to 60 percent off so we
[24:45.480 --> 24:51.320]  at least make like 10 bucks and can fund ourselves in the future but this is at cost in fact you
[24:51.320 --> 24:57.240]  factor in everything this is below cost but if you want to experience ampm eight pack power stack
[24:58.440 --> 25:01.880]  take it in the morning throw it in your lunchbox you'll take it in the afternoon the evening
[25:01.880 --> 25:09.560]  it's got fish oil for am and pm it's got a not nice healthy sleep aid as well so i wouldn't
[25:09.560 --> 25:16.600]  take that pill until you're ready to go to bed this is really an amazing product and what is it five
[25:16.600 --> 25:22.200]  of the pills are proprietary really souped up special things we came up with so this is one of
[25:22.200 --> 25:27.480]  my ideas and usually my ideas do really really great this idea did not do that great until i sold
[25:27.480 --> 25:33.080]  it cost and now you know people are getting it so if you want the ampm stack eight pack power stack

[30:19.320 --> 30:25.160]  how many africans and asian kids will left to starve just to beat donald trump the new yorker
[30:25.160 --> 30:30.440]  the nation of the united nations all warned that the lockdown is threatening and already causing
[30:30.440 --> 30:37.080]  famine and already starving hundreds of thousands to death a day those are real numbers but it's
[30:37.080 --> 30:43.400]  not as sexy as having steven cobert and hillary clinton tell you that you're a hero when you
[30:43.400 --> 30:50.520]  when you stay locked up and you don't go out when the first world collapses the third world dies
[30:57.240 --> 31:04.120]  let me go ahead and cover this because so many people have been bringing it up to me
[31:04.120 --> 31:12.360]  i have been sent this article at least five times today
[31:16.040 --> 31:22.520]  and that's good but let me show the listeners this new study suggests vitamin d is linked
[31:22.520 --> 31:31.480]  to covet 19 mortality how a common vitamin could become pivotal and it goes on with these
[31:31.480 --> 31:38.840]  giant world studies hundreds of them conclusively showing that everyone dying of covet 19
[31:38.840 --> 31:47.560]  has a vitamin d deficiency now i have literally had members of congress over the phone asked me
[31:47.560 --> 31:52.200]  hey alex i hear you're promoting zinc and vitamin d is that does that really work and i'm just like
[31:52.200 --> 31:59.080]  you you can find out in five seconds congressman people don't even know the most basic stuff you
[31:59.080 --> 32:11.640]  die without it and that's what frustrates me is that i'm not that smart and i know all this stuff
[32:12.440 --> 32:19.400]  i mean even my dad is a doctor and my mom is extremely smart and going back two three months
[32:19.400 --> 32:24.760]  ago when my mother wouldn't leave the house overall this is she's a smart lady i had to go over there
[32:24.760 --> 32:29.800]  and i said mom just here's some zinc tablets and some vitamin d she goes oh i take a multivitamin i
[32:29.800 --> 32:36.360]  said listen you need three or four times daily allowances to protect yourselves during this if
[32:36.360 --> 32:40.760]  you think it's real and you need three or four times vitamin d she goes oh how do you know that
[32:40.760 --> 32:46.680]  i pulled up articles for her on her ipad and it's like oh okay but i mean does my mother think i'm
[32:46.680 --> 32:55.240]  making this up i mean what the hell i guess because i'm confident people think it's all just an
[32:55.240 --> 32:58.920]  actor or something i and look i know most the audience is smarter than i am and you know all
[32:58.920 --> 33:07.640]  this stuff i just i've had my own personal family law lawyer who's a great guy when i was in his
[33:07.640 --> 33:11.320]  office three months ago when he was scared to death you know for his family and he takes care of his
[33:11.320 --> 33:19.960]  old parents and he had me six feet away from him and i looked at him and i said listen if you have
[33:19.960 --> 33:28.040]  vitamin d three and you have zinc in the studies it's almost impossible for you to get this it's
[33:28.040 --> 33:35.640]  it's a deficiency is what causes it and i finally convinced him of it and it took me 30 minutes
[33:35.640 --> 33:47.000]  it's a deficiency and i'm not just here pulling this out of the sky the people perish for lack of
[33:47.000 --> 33:55.880]  knowledge and i've had friends and i've had family look me right in the eyes including
[33:57.240 --> 34:03.000]  the lawyer and he goes but the who says there is no treatment or no cure
[34:03.000 --> 34:10.200]  and i looked at him and i said you know what scurvy is he goes yeah three are gonna have
[34:10.200 --> 34:15.560]  vitamin c and you die i said oh yeah why is vitamin c called essential because you gotta
[34:15.560 --> 34:20.280]  have it to live and i said listen you don't need to be a medical doctor to know you need water
[34:20.280 --> 34:27.800]  you need oxygen and every vitamin and mineral that is essential means you die without it you die
[34:27.800 --> 34:35.320]  and what in the world is the united nations doing
[34:39.560 --> 34:40.440]  telling us
[34:43.960 --> 34:51.560]  that vitamin d and zinc and vitamin c are worthless they have the fbi swat teaming
[34:51.560 --> 34:57.720]  medical doctors that prescribe vitamin c to their patients and they say there's no known treatment
[34:57.720 --> 35:03.880]  or cure what the hell does that mean yes if you've already gotten sick because you don't have enough
[35:03.880 --> 35:09.560]  vitamin c or other key component of your body and you've already got it you're probably dead but
[35:09.560 --> 35:15.640]  doesn't matter we have a right to go to doctors and they have a right to give us vitamin c that you
[35:15.640 --> 35:23.880]  can buy at Whole Foods but again the criminal you in since when do they command the fbi
[35:28.040 --> 35:32.680]  and again these fbi agents are just being ordered to do this but they've got these holier
[35:32.680 --> 35:38.760]  than now ones out there like we stopped this doctor this scammer in there he was giving them
[35:38.760 --> 35:49.560]  vitamin c and that's not allowed what so they got a studies out of sweden you name it writers
[35:49.560 --> 35:54.520]  you can read this article huge studies with tens of thousands of people and they found
[35:56.040 --> 36:00.120]  everyone that died had a vitamin d efficiency
[36:00.120 --> 36:08.680]  yeah oh but Fauci says getting sunlight's not good see because you don't need to go buy
[36:08.680 --> 36:13.720]  vitamin d you can just go get 30 minutes of sun a couple days a week in direct sun
[36:15.640 --> 36:17.240]  year-round at the equator
[36:21.960 --> 36:29.400]  but in our clients six months earlier and you're as good as pumpkin pie and you know what i know i'm
[36:29.400 --> 36:33.720]  up here saying a lot of really simple stuff the the the regular audience like john's get to some
[36:34.280 --> 36:39.560]  new breaking stuff we all know this listen you you know what's going on i'm talking to new listeners
[36:39.560 --> 36:44.760]  driving down the road let's invest on almost 200 radio stations we're on and they literally think
[36:44.760 --> 36:50.280]  because the news says that you don't need vitamin c you don't need d3 you don't need zinc they think
[36:50.280 --> 36:56.920]  that's made up people really think vitamins are a scam folks i have people that have harvard degrees
[36:56.920 --> 37:02.520]  look me right in the eye and they go tell me the truth are you something that's a scam i mean is
[37:02.520 --> 37:06.120]  that just is that just a sugar pill and i'm just looking i'm going
[37:08.760 --> 37:14.040]  what the hell what do you think i am but again
[37:16.040 --> 37:21.720]  what's a scam is the vaccines there's almost no vaccine that works because they never can
[37:21.720 --> 37:26.520]  match it up for the reputation and that member bill gates came out a month ago and he said yeah
[37:26.520 --> 37:31.960]  most vaccines don't work now we need to make them even stronger but we're gonna have side effects
[37:31.960 --> 37:38.280]  when you make them stronger see they know they can't cover this up anymore they're the scammers
[37:38.280 --> 37:44.120]  they're the people projecting you exercise you drink clean water you get all your vitamins
[37:44.120 --> 37:51.480]  and minerals you pray studies show that you have a dog you add all that together you live 20 years
[37:51.480 --> 37:58.680]  longer than the average person yeah having a dog makes you live longer and by the way it's not just
[37:58.680 --> 38:01.720]  that they're sweet and then they're loving and you take care of them like they're a baby it's like
[38:01.720 --> 38:06.520]  having a child that's part of the other question is the buffer of all the bacteria and viruses they
[38:06.520 --> 38:12.280]  have aren't exactly like yours so they can't really get you sick because most species can't
[38:12.280 --> 38:17.400]  get each other sick with both pathogens but it creates a biological buffer so having a dog in
[38:17.400 --> 38:25.160]  your house is like a probiotic it's evened out with cats because they've got a brain parasite
[38:25.160 --> 38:31.240]  that infests about a billion people that evens out cats because if the cat has that and you get it
[38:32.120 --> 38:36.600]  then it could be a real problem but cats are still good for you overall to have as well but not
[38:36.600 --> 38:42.600]  like a dog and and these are just the things that are known like doctors used to tell old couples
[38:42.600 --> 38:48.440]  like when the husband or wife died hey why don't you get a dog because they knew that
[38:48.440 --> 38:54.280]  when the husband or wife dies and the other persons like 75 they'll usually die in a few months if
[38:54.280 --> 39:01.480]  they don't get a dog it's all known ladies and gentlemen but the WHO I'm sure will hear this
[39:01.480 --> 39:06.120]  and say up there's there's no proof that dogs are good for you and there's no proof praying is good
[39:06.120 --> 39:10.760]  for you even though all the studies say it because they want you alone and desperate and only believing
[39:10.760 --> 39:17.000]  them a cult telling you that we can't open schools up in the fall a cult saying never shake hands
[39:17.000 --> 39:25.240]  again a cult putting kids in bubbles in china acts will blow up bubbles teaching us that we're all
[39:25.240 --> 39:30.920]  bad and we're ugly and we're evil and now the UN's announced oh COVID-19's never going to end
[39:32.120 --> 39:35.960]  we'll cover that and play all the clips and more when we come back and I'll give the number of
[39:35.960 --> 39:41.720]  first-time callers in the first round today open phones in the second third hour hell let's just
[39:41.720 --> 39:49.320]  give the number out now 877-789 alex 877-789-2539 if you're calling international and can't call
[39:49.320 --> 39:54.760]  1-800 numbers in some countries in the country access code five I'm always excited about info
[39:54.760 --> 39:58.520]  war's live products they're amazing they're cutting edge you love them I love them and they find the
[39:58.520 --> 40:04.840]  info war in the face of the globalist onslaught but we have come up with a new product over a year
[40:04.840 --> 40:14.120]  in development that is amazing the only organic hand sanitizer on the market with organic essential
[40:14.120 --> 40:21.560]  oils on top of it and there's another innovation it's the spray cap it doesn't just pour out a
[40:21.560 --> 40:28.200]  bunch of thick gross you goo but it's high quality it aerosolizes it in a really great way I like to
[40:28.200 --> 40:33.320]  put it on my hands rub a little bit on my face it's got organic alcohol in it so spray it around
[40:33.320 --> 40:39.160]  your eyes but I just love it personally it's something that's a moisturizer as well show
[40:39.160 --> 40:43.560]  this is a real innovation I don't know why others didn't think of coming out with a hand sanitizer
[40:43.560 --> 40:49.080]  that actually has essential oil in it so it doesn't dry you out smells great it's so refreshing
[40:49.880 --> 40:56.840]  this is a big winner I don't have to tell you that we are in the most important point in human
[40:56.840 --> 41:01.400]  history the globalists have taken the gloves off and they've taken the mask off and they're like
[41:01.400 --> 41:07.400]  yeah you're taking implantable chips yeah we're into pedophilia yeah we're into world government
[41:07.400 --> 41:14.280]  yeah you're obsolete you are non-essential we are shutting your ass down yeah we told you
[41:14.280 --> 41:18.440]  don't be farmers and don't be ranchers and don't work in industry anymore you're going to be the
[41:18.440 --> 41:23.720]  service economy and now all the globalists are telling you that there's no more service economy
[41:23.720 --> 41:29.320]  and you're obsolete so you better bow down to them and get your universal pens income so they can
[41:29.320 --> 41:35.560]  dictate your life the handcuffs are going on right now we have to resist and say no to the new world
[41:35.560 --> 41:40.600]  order and that takes you understanding you were right and understanding I was right and getting
[41:40.600 --> 41:47.240]  in people's faces and raising the alarm now while you still can now is the time for action now is the
[41:47.240 --> 41:55.560]  time for you to shine and be the paul reveres you know you are I don't like coming to you every day
[41:55.560 --> 41:59.560]  on the radio and TV stations that you watch and listen to a song and telling you all these horrible
[41:59.560 --> 42:05.400]  things but you notice almost everything we've talked about horrible has come true we were warning
[42:05.400 --> 42:11.640]  everybody to try to stop it it's like telling somebody if you got a pool put a fence around it
[42:11.640 --> 42:15.800]  if you have little kids because even if they're good swimmers they can hit their head and drown
[42:15.800 --> 42:20.040]  people don't listen they go out and their kids dead in the pool well ladies and gentlemen this is
[42:20.040 --> 42:25.880]  the death of the third world the collapse of the first world and this is 21st century warfare carried
[42:25.880 --> 42:31.000]  out by the globalist and they admit they've orchestrated it they admit it's quote good to
[42:31.000 --> 42:35.640]  save the earth and they're teaching us to be more frugal and they want to make us poor so they can
[42:35.640 --> 42:41.960]  dictate our surrender to this post-human technocracy I know all this sounds insane when I was talking
[42:41.960 --> 42:47.880]  about it 25 years ago but now it's public because it's their operations manual I wish this wasn't
[42:47.880 --> 42:52.600]  the case but they're really our evil psychopaths in control of most major institutions and we've
[42:52.600 --> 42:58.680]  got to stop them holem block has really been a sleeper product for us we got it in a few years
[42:58.680 --> 43:04.600]  ago it's an amazing product that comes from all natural quail eggs they discovered this more than
[43:04.600 --> 43:10.200]  30 years ago in france that if you ate quail eggs from a certain type of quail that it had an
[43:10.200 --> 43:15.240]  anti-histamine effect and people saw their allergies and seasonal discomfort knocked way

[44:10.280 --> 44:20.920]  yeah
[44:33.240 --> 44:35.480]  we are back live we are broadcasting worldwide
[44:35.480 --> 44:42.600]  all right let's let's just turn the music off okay I'm gonna re-broadcast for a while I'm gonna
[44:42.600 --> 44:47.640]  reset and come back into the show and this isn't some dramatic thing there's just too much going
[44:47.640 --> 44:50.280]  on behind the scenes here for me to continue at this point let me see what I'm gonna hear
[44:50.840 --> 44:54.760]  I'm gonna start the next hour I'm gonna get refocused and ready because I was about to come
[44:54.760 --> 44:59.400]  in and tell you something just incredibly important there was a message of the president I was gonna
[44:59.400 --> 45:04.760]  give and I just got distracted I might just block out that window over there in the control room
[45:04.760 --> 45:09.720]  because there's just so much going on in there and I'm not mad at the crew it just continues to distract
[45:09.720 --> 45:20.760]  me damn it man I got serious stuff to cover here this is serious business
[45:29.480 --> 45:34.040]  everything we fought and built everything our ancestors stood for is being erased right in
[45:34.040 --> 45:40.040]  front of us this is going to be decades of devastation and these evil criminals are carrying
[45:40.040 --> 45:47.640]  this out and laughing about it and the public is so dumb they don't know you die without vitamin c
[45:48.840 --> 45:53.320]  and that most the old us is are from people not even being
[45:56.440 --> 45:57.160]  aware of this
[45:57.160 --> 46:05.560]  it's the TV it's the culture it's the attention span it's just fried everybody's brain including mine
[46:11.880 --> 46:16.280]  total three number to join us is eight seven seven seven eight nine two five three nine
[46:17.240 --> 46:23.240]  we're gonna go to Derek and Glenn and Linda and Casey and Jim and everybody else
[46:23.240 --> 46:29.240]  and I I said I was gonna do this yesterday I didn't do it and I said I was gonna do it last
[46:29.240 --> 46:35.560]  weekend I didn't do it and I was just about to go ahead and do it because it's a very important
[46:35.560 --> 46:40.120]  message to the president and it's a very important message to everybody to understand what's going
[46:40.120 --> 46:48.760]  on because I know what's going on with Trump and if Trump would simply understand this we
[46:48.760 --> 46:54.280]  could turn all of this around in fact Joel Scousen is very intelligent I don't need to tell you that
[46:54.280 --> 47:00.680]  we should get him back on and I should have this discussion for a full hour with him in fact I've
[47:00.680 --> 47:05.400]  said Scousen needs to fly here he doesn't care about the money but I'll pay for his jet fuel he's a
[47:05.400 --> 47:12.200]  pilot get his ass here because he understood this like three years ago and I was still enamored with
[47:12.200 --> 47:18.360]  Trump and didn't understand it now I a hundred percent know that what Scousen said is true directly
[47:18.360 --> 47:25.480]  from Trump's advisors and I respect the president and he means well and he's a smart guy in many ways
[47:26.040 --> 47:31.800]  but Scousen put his finger directly on it Trump doesn't know how all these agencies and things work
[47:34.200 --> 47:40.920]  he's good on his feet he has good instincts but he doesn't know the building blocks of all this
[47:40.920 --> 47:45.720]  and I talked to people that work with the president daily and they tell me they go Jones
[47:46.440 --> 47:52.200]  he has no idea that Fauci is a globalist he has no idea about Bill he thinks Bill Gates
[47:52.200 --> 47:57.480]  is his friend because Bill Gates tells him he's his friend so yeah I got stuff to the president
[47:57.480 --> 48:04.280]  on Fauci and let me explain something you think I feel good that I'm the one getting files together
[48:04.280 --> 48:09.400]  for the president and having law firms prepare stuff for him and then I get they want to kill me
[48:09.400 --> 48:14.200]  over this because I'm not the only smart person everybody else knows it but if you tell him
[48:14.200 --> 48:17.080]  what's going on they come after you that's what they went after Flynn
[48:24.200 --> 48:28.200]  and so I realized it's important to talk to the audience and get you active and to get you taken
[48:28.200 --> 48:36.440]  action you know we probably need to give people some context we're going to put this photo up
[48:36.440 --> 48:42.280]  that's a Bill Gates senior with David Rockefeller a bunch of others at a world eugenics meeting
[48:43.240 --> 48:44.520]  you can see Anderson Cooper's
[48:49.240 --> 48:54.840]  pastor uh Annenberg all those damn foundation people that's them right there
[48:57.320 --> 49:01.480]  Anthony Fauci and all of them sneaking around oh god just get them off the screen
[49:01.480 --> 49:08.920]  let me tell you something folks we have them 100 dead to rights open and shut case they
[49:08.920 --> 49:14.440]  could all be indicted and sent to supermax presidents for what they've done okay and now
[49:14.440 --> 49:19.160]  they're dropping the hammer coming with forced inoculations the new york times says next year
[49:19.160 --> 49:20.120]  we told you that
[49:20.120 --> 49:28.520]  and big tech is spying on everyone and trunk needs to stop it
[49:32.120 --> 49:35.960]  let's just go to this report I gotta take a break I may just end the show today because it's I
[49:37.240 --> 49:41.640]  our head's not in the game today let's go ahead and go to this special report
[49:41.640 --> 49:52.360]  or let's go ahead and go to Joe Biden caught lying three times in one interview about general
[49:52.360 --> 49:56.680]  Flynn investigation and of course the unmasking documents have come out that he was on the list
[49:56.680 --> 50:05.880]  and and lied about it all over the news and a bunch of criminals here it is on May 13th 2020
[50:05.880 --> 50:10.520]  Chuck Grassley and Ron Johnson received a declassified document from the director of
[50:10.520 --> 50:14.600]  national intelligence Richard Grinnell the document provided a list of identities of
[50:14.600 --> 50:20.600]  officials who had submitted requests to the NSA to unmask certain names which led to the reopening
[50:20.600 --> 50:26.200]  of the Michael Flynn case while some of the names are still blacked out on this three page memo
[50:26.200 --> 50:31.560]  some of the names of interest are ambassador to the united nations Samantha power and then little
[50:31.560 --> 50:38.280]  did I know that my own country and my own president would would in effect create and inhabit his own
[50:38.280 --> 50:45.000]  upside down land right where Trump's tweets which I you know have the misfortune like many others
[50:45.000 --> 50:53.880]  of reading most days remind me so much of this kind of diversionary um what aboutism the director
[50:53.880 --> 50:59.960]  of national intelligence at the time James Clapper and oh by the way uh blown off what the then
[50:59.960 --> 51:05.480]  commander chief the president obama told us to do which was to assemble all the reporting that we
[51:05.480 --> 51:11.960]  could that we had available to us and put it in one report that the president could pass on to the
[51:11.960 --> 51:18.600]  congress and to the next administration and while we're at it uh declassify as much as we possibly
[51:18.600 --> 51:24.760]  could to make it public and that and that's what we did director the cia john o brennan you know
[51:24.760 --> 51:28.840]  people are innocent until you know alleged to be involved in some type of criminal activity
[51:28.840 --> 51:34.520]  director of the fbi james comey with respect to bars comments i really don't know what he's talking
[51:34.520 --> 51:43.000]  about when he talks about spying on the campaign and so i i can't really react substantively when i
[51:43.000 --> 51:49.960]  hear that kind of language used it's concerning because the fbi of the department of justice
[51:49.960 --> 51:57.800]  conduct court ordered electronic surveillance i have never thought of that as spying and on the
[51:57.800 --> 52:02.360]  third page denise mcdonough who was the chief of staff of president obama at the time do you
[52:02.360 --> 52:06.040]  have any knowledge of what the content of the call was i don't are you concerned at all that it
[52:06.040 --> 52:09.880]  was don't worry about these sanctions we will undo them when we get into office i'm not gonna get
[52:09.880 --> 52:14.520]  into any particular concerns but i do think that the content matters and we'll see what uh uh what
[52:14.520 --> 52:20.840]  that uh how that shakes out and vice president joe biden now here's a clip of joe biden lying
[52:20.840 --> 52:26.680]  three different times when asked about what he knew about the michael flinn investigation i do
[52:26.680 --> 52:30.440]  want to ask you about michael flinn the former national security advisor to president trump
[52:30.440 --> 52:35.720]  and the move by the just front last week to dismiss the case against him for lying to the fbi
[52:35.720 --> 52:40.040]  the president said yesterday that that move is justified because president obama targeted flinn
[52:40.040 --> 52:45.240]  he called it quote the biggest political crime in u.s history your former senate colleague charles
[52:45.240 --> 52:50.040]  grassley is out of it flinn was entrapped and asked on the senate floor what did obama and
[52:50.040 --> 52:55.640]  biden know when did they know it so what did you know about those moves to investigate uh
[52:55.640 --> 53:01.400]  michael flinn and was there anything improper done i know nothing about those moves to investigate
[53:01.400 --> 53:06.200]  michael flinn number one number two this is all about the version i do want to press that you
[53:06.200 --> 53:11.080]  say you didn't know anything about it but you were reported to be at a january 5 2017 meeting
[53:11.080 --> 53:17.000]  where you and the president were briefed on the fbi's plan to question michael michael flinn over
[53:17.000 --> 53:23.720]  those uh conversations he had with the russian ambassador kiss liak now i thought you asked me
[53:23.720 --> 53:30.360]  whether or not i had anything to do with him being prosecuted okay i'm sorry i was aware that there
[53:30.360 --> 53:34.760]  was that they're they asked for an investigation but that's all i know about it and i don't think
[53:34.760 --> 53:39.080]  anything else look was the just department right to drop those charges against michael flinn
[53:40.360 --> 53:45.320]  well based on a couple thousand i guess i saw a headline the other yesterday i guess a couple
[53:45.320 --> 53:51.640]  thousand uh former uh or was a couple hundred i'm not sure a whole lot of former just department
[53:51.640 --> 53:57.560]  people said uh the uh the uh the attorney general should step down i have been absolutely stunned
[53:57.560 --> 54:03.960]  by the way in which he has not conducted the office properly but look i i i don't know the detail
[54:03.960 --> 54:09.880]  of where we are right now my point is a simple one focus on what's in front of us you have plenty
[54:09.880 --> 54:21.640]  of time to investigate this issue i think there's nothing there there and it's time for humanity
[54:21.640 --> 54:26.120]  to stand up in the info war and say i don't know what's gonna happen at the end of this
[54:26.120 --> 54:34.760]  but you want to fight you better believe you got one from the front lines of the information war
[54:34.760 --> 54:43.000]  for it's alex jones
[54:44.280 --> 54:50.360]  this is the end my friends my only friends the end of our elaborate plans the end
[54:51.240 --> 54:58.520]  of everything that stands the end the safety the delusion it's all over ladies and gentlemen
[54:58.520 --> 55:06.680]  because it was only the mirage of safety movies and partying and living like children never growing
[55:06.680 --> 55:13.160]  up ever caring about other people this delivered us into the hands of tyranny just like the history
[55:13.160 --> 55:17.880]  book show it's just like the bible states every time israel became corrupt and evil and turned
[55:17.880 --> 55:24.760]  away from god they were brought into captivity because their people sold out to special interest
[55:24.760 --> 55:30.520]  that were infiltrated by spies and then they were enslaved we are repeating that again today
[55:30.520 --> 55:38.040]  compliance and going along with this system leads to absolute bondage info wars has decided to fight

[57:38.440 --> 57:44.440]  organization recommended forcibly removing family members from their homes and putting them in
[57:44.440 --> 57:51.640]  quarantine now we need to go and look in families to find those people who may be sick and remove
[57:51.640 --> 57:58.200]  them and isolate them in a in a safe and dignified manner queen elizabeth seemed to be echoing this
[57:58.200 --> 58:05.880]  idea to the uk it reminds me of the very first broadcast i made in 1940 helped by my sister
[58:07.320 --> 58:13.080]  we as children spoke from here at winsor to children who had been evacuated from their homes
[58:13.080 --> 58:22.520]  and sent away for their own safety today once again many will feel a painful sense of separation
[58:22.520 --> 58:31.640]  from their loved ones but now as then we know deep down that it is the right thing to do bill gates
[58:31.640 --> 58:37.640]  has been pushing the idea of tracking people with digital tattoos and microsoft was recently

[1:00:18.280 --> 1:00:25.640]  be necessary as long as the emergency period continues for info wars dot com this is greg reese
[1:00:28.920 --> 1:00:33.400]  all right i'm going to take your phone calls for the next two hours and go through all the news
[1:00:33.400 --> 1:00:38.840]  it's breaking and unfolding and if i seem nasty and and angry and there's nothing to do with the
[1:00:38.840 --> 1:00:45.400]  crew um the fact that the new world order is actually doing all this and they've now announced a
[1:00:45.400 --> 1:00:51.160]  permanent lockdown we knew that was coming it just means this is war and it means they're not
[1:00:51.160 --> 1:01:03.880]  going to back down they're not going to stop and i am torn by what we should do
[1:01:05.880 --> 1:01:13.800]  and i do know that a lot of important people take stock in what we say so that adds to the
[1:01:13.800 --> 1:01:19.080]  stress of this and and i don't want to say i'm cracking under the pressure no one can handle
[1:01:19.080 --> 1:01:23.400]  pressure like this not the president not you not me not anybody that's why god's got to come into
[1:01:23.400 --> 1:01:29.480]  this that's why i said yesterday i commit my destiny into god's hands i mean that's all you
[1:01:29.480 --> 1:01:35.160]  can do is quote the psalms because these people are absolutely evil and they're trying to create a
[1:01:35.160 --> 1:01:41.080]  worldwide depression they've they've done it and it's gonna only just get more horrible from here on
[1:01:41.080 --> 1:01:48.680]  out until we crush these people and that's what this is coming down to they have really crossed the line
[1:01:53.160 --> 1:01:58.760]  the united states is not communist china we don't have three million people in concentration camps
[1:01:58.760 --> 1:02:04.600]  we don't blow up churches we don't kill political dissidents and sell their organs but all of the
[1:02:04.600 --> 1:02:12.040]  news we see the u.n. billable indicates w.h.o. mainstream corporate media praising communist china
[1:02:12.040 --> 1:02:16.920]  for their response and if communist china shoots women at checkpoints and welds people into their
[1:02:16.920 --> 1:02:21.800]  houses and has robots controlling people well then gee we've got to do that and on top of it
[1:02:21.800 --> 1:02:26.840]  cities like san Antonio pass laws saying will arrest you if you say chinese virus well now
[1:02:26.840 --> 1:02:32.680]  qualmo in new york's calling it the european virus these people are out of control control freaks
[1:02:32.680 --> 1:02:37.640]  and they are going to lose big time because we the people are aware of their criminal activities
[1:02:37.640 --> 1:02:42.920]  and are exposing them in their power grab the resistance lives at band on video and in full
[1:02:42.920 --> 1:02:48.520]  wars dot com spread those links and jam it down the censors throats and then we'll be able to defeat
[1:02:48.520 --> 1:03:13.400]  their operation that much quicker if you are receiving this transmission you are the resistance
[1:03:13.400 --> 1:03:19.720]  live from the info wars dot com studios it's alex jones
[1:03:22.200 --> 1:03:26.440]  thousands and thousands of years of human history everything our ancestors
[1:03:27.080 --> 1:03:36.200]  stroves to do battled to succeed is now coming to this point now with the globalist technocrats
[1:03:36.200 --> 1:03:43.320]  believing in a post human era that they've taken control of human evolution to not empower humanity
[1:03:43.320 --> 1:03:53.320]  but to end humanity they must be met with total resistance and total commitment and the living
[1:03:53.320 --> 1:04:02.680]  gods standard must be born before us all right let's lay it out the quickening of the quickening
[1:04:02.680 --> 1:04:07.800]  of the quickening is beginning and you've got the general flin information coming out you've
[1:04:07.800 --> 1:04:14.680]  got manifold getting released you've got biden illegally unmasking and spying on candidate
[1:04:14.680 --> 1:04:20.280]  and then president trump and then lying about it you've got obama lying about it you've got obama
[1:04:21.320 --> 1:04:28.760]  asking the fbi director to conceal this from the president elect this is a coup
[1:04:28.760 --> 1:04:40.360]  and if you go back to 2017 we were there in dc and we have our sources
[1:04:42.600 --> 1:04:46.920]  that explain that trump was under massive counterterrorism counter espionage
[1:04:48.200 --> 1:04:55.240]  investigation by crossfire hurricane and we specifically exposed who was behind it not
[1:04:55.240 --> 1:05:00.760]  because we were the smartest guys in the room but because we had the courage to do it
[1:05:03.080 --> 1:05:08.440]  and if you'll remember we laid it all out and early on they were bragging in the new york
[1:05:08.440 --> 1:05:17.960]  times when he was president elect in december of 2016 when the ink wasn't even dry on his victory
[1:05:17.960 --> 1:05:24.040]  they were trying to block him being seated by delegates they said we were wiretapping him
[1:05:24.040 --> 1:05:33.320]  we know he's a russian agent and i remember talking to roger stoner others and roger going
[1:05:33.960 --> 1:05:38.840]  donald trump doesn't even trust his own lawyers and his own people around him he would never work
[1:05:38.840 --> 1:05:47.080]  with a foreign power he's absolutely pro america to a neurotic level and that's what you get with
[1:05:47.080 --> 1:05:54.920]  trump absolutely loyal lost billions of dollars being president gone through hell he's the real deal
[1:06:00.600 --> 1:06:07.240]  the problem is he's a one-man show he takes everything in himself and then makes decisions
[1:06:08.440 --> 1:06:13.080]  off of his knowledge base and off his instincts and does not research the opposition
[1:06:13.080 --> 1:06:18.120]  and that's why he can have a bill gates saying i'm your buddy when bill gates is orchestrating
[1:06:18.120 --> 1:06:23.480]  the whole thing against america and trump and now trump knows that and now trump knows that about
[1:06:23.480 --> 1:06:30.200]  fouchy he actually thought he could trust the military always to be faithful because he puts
[1:06:30.200 --> 1:06:35.080]  him on a pedestal when a lot of them are globalists he thought medical people he could put on a pedestal
[1:06:35.080 --> 1:06:43.960]  he could be faithful trump is very naïve in ways and and i don't just hear that i know that
[1:06:46.360 --> 1:06:52.040]  we got in the information on fouchy and on gates three weeks ago
[1:06:54.840 --> 1:07:02.600]  and you saw immediate action and that's why you notice that kelly when he was the chief of staff
[1:07:02.600 --> 1:07:07.480]  info wars away from the president well they got a problem now the president
[1:07:10.120 --> 1:07:12.520]  goes to info wars the president goes to gateway pundit
[1:07:15.880 --> 1:07:20.920]  and so anywhere the president goes comes under attack because they're simply trying to
[1:07:22.760 --> 1:07:29.240]  knock out places that trump tunes into and then he has the gut instinct that's accurate of course
[1:07:29.240 --> 1:07:33.960]  we do the real research and then trump goes yeah that's it like you know darth vader and
[1:07:33.960 --> 1:07:37.960]  imparts tracks back when they go they could be smugglers they go could be rebels that's it the
[1:07:37.960 --> 1:07:43.080]  rebels are there that that's what trump's like and he's basically always right the problem is
[1:07:43.080 --> 1:07:47.400]  though he makes the decision right there in that moment and so that's why they're always trying to
[1:07:47.400 --> 1:07:53.080]  keep anybody real away from him because he doesn't do the research
[1:07:53.080 --> 1:08:00.040]  but when he sees somebody that has the research and it clicks with his data set he goes with it
[1:08:00.040 --> 1:08:05.080]  and that's why they're so scared so trump's completely real folks that's why the establishment
[1:08:05.080 --> 1:08:10.760]  is so horrified by him because they have these big committee meetings and they
[1:08:11.720 --> 1:08:16.600]  check with all the special interests before they do anything and so the corruption and it just sets
[1:08:16.600 --> 1:08:27.000]  in and now you see and here's the big news now you see bill gates melinda gates obama
[1:08:27.640 --> 1:08:36.680]  michael obama all these people coming out and saying trump did a bad job trump did a terrible
[1:08:36.680 --> 1:08:43.000]  job because the minute trump two weeks ago quietly sidelined fouchy and said your models are all
[1:08:43.000 --> 1:08:49.720]  completely wrong 50 times 30 times higher than what they said you're done well no we're not keeping
[1:08:49.720 --> 1:08:55.400]  things closed until the election it's going to kill hundreds of millions of people worldwide
[1:08:55.400 --> 1:09:01.080]  we're not doing it you got a chance to just sit down and shut up fouchy then went and rang the
[1:09:01.080 --> 1:09:07.960]  alarm and then you saw gates and all them open up on and i mean i was sitting there
[1:09:07.960 --> 1:09:15.320]  filling in you know the president's advisors and i mean i just said i can't handle this anymore
[1:09:15.320 --> 1:09:19.000]  so i got on the phone i called a bunch of them three weeks ago i said when you talk to the
[1:09:19.000 --> 1:09:23.560]  president you got to get him this you got to get him that and then they did and then trump said really
[1:09:26.680 --> 1:09:28.760]  and by the way these lawyers for the president all these other people
[1:09:30.440 --> 1:09:34.040]  and these big national talk show hosts they don't know all this they're like really bill gates his
[1:09:34.040 --> 1:09:37.800]  dad was a federal reserve board really he was the head of blamberton really bill gates says he hates
[1:09:37.800 --> 1:09:42.440]  trump they didn't know all this i had to get it all for him now you saw media matters obviously
[1:09:42.440 --> 1:09:45.400]  they're hooked in with intelligence agencies and globalists so they don't they're not just
[1:09:45.400 --> 1:09:48.840]  listening to the show they're doing a lot more than that they had a big article a couple weeks ago
[1:09:48.840 --> 1:09:55.160]  saying we need to get rid of jones he's advising the president to go after uh gates and they and
[1:09:55.160 --> 1:10:01.800]  they raised a full alarm about that and again this shows how weak the globalists are that
[1:10:01.800 --> 1:10:08.280]  alex jones in texas is willing to walk the tightrope because i'm committed to this
[1:10:09.160 --> 1:10:12.360]  and all these other men are scared to tell the president
[1:10:14.680 --> 1:10:18.120]  and i've got to call up famous people that are friends with the president
[1:10:18.120 --> 1:10:22.760]  and say you care about your kids you better do something now you better tell trump this
[1:10:22.760 --> 1:10:28.680]  his enemy is gates his enemy is fouchy his enemies the un they're a chi-com group i know the president
[1:10:28.680 --> 1:10:32.760]  already gets this but he has to level with the public and say choose america or choose them
[1:10:32.760 --> 1:10:36.920]  and by the way they want to bankrupt you and destroy you america will choose trump
[1:10:36.920 --> 1:10:38.600]  but he's got to completely level
[1:10:43.080 --> 1:10:49.240]  and then it happened again we influenced the president to make the right move and i only
[1:10:49.240 --> 1:10:59.080]  say that here on air so that you understand why we're in so much danger and i go back to this
[1:10:59.080 --> 1:11:03.000]  limbaugh came out two days ago and said the democrats want to destroy the economy to kill
[1:11:03.000 --> 1:11:10.760]  trump to kill the movement we told you that three months ago again it's not that we're that smart
[1:11:10.760 --> 1:11:16.840]  we can't keep waiting until it's completely obvious we have to act now on all this we have
[1:11:16.840 --> 1:11:22.360]  their whole damn plan these people are completely evil we have their whole operation it's so easy to
[1:11:22.360 --> 1:11:30.200]  beat them and i know some guys high up in the cia and stuff that are american patriots they
[1:11:30.200 --> 1:11:34.680]  claim they're like well jones you know we need the dialectic of how bad they are so they know
[1:11:34.680 --> 1:11:41.720]  how good we are no we don't need the dialectic of of this giant hydra cancer that that that is already
[1:11:41.720 --> 1:11:47.720]  it damaged the whole planet and it's completely out of control deal with it now cut it out right
[1:11:47.720 --> 1:11:54.840]  now god almighty we have been living by committee so long and passing the buck so long that the damn
[1:11:54.840 --> 1:12:01.080]  world is burning down because a bunch of spoiled brat globalist billionaires want to teach everyone
[1:12:01.080 --> 1:12:06.440]  that they that they can't be capitalist or they can't support trump or americans can't have guns
[1:12:06.440 --> 1:12:15.320]  or the left's all obsessed with our son's testicles the recklessness is letting them go on the inaction
[1:12:15.320 --> 1:12:22.840]  is action it's the worst type of action and they fear us because we are the detonator
[1:12:24.840 --> 1:12:29.240]  of course i'm trying to detonate the destruction of these people not because i want to step on
[1:12:29.240 --> 1:12:38.120]  them to feel big they have to be removed for our children's future these people aren't just corrupt
[1:12:38.120 --> 1:12:44.600]  real politic folks that want power they want power over life they want to wreck things they're
[1:12:44.600 --> 1:12:52.120]  devilish they're diabolical they are of satan took hundreds and hundreds of years of human
[1:12:52.120 --> 1:12:58.600]  civilization to build up the world economy to where it is every economist is on record saying that
[1:12:58.600 --> 1:13:03.960]  as this economy has been shut down for two months it is going to be a death sentence to the third

[1:15:26.600 --> 1:15:37.800]  first-time callers today on this live thursday edition now you have powerful multinational
[1:15:37.800 --> 1:15:44.680]  corporations that put communist china in place and have had one-sided trade deals to deindustrialize
[1:15:44.680 --> 1:15:49.560]  the west and move our jobs there and they promised us oh we'll be a service economy now
[1:15:49.560 --> 1:15:58.280]  but now they say that's obsolete that that is non-essential so so this is economic
[1:15:58.280 --> 1:16:02.760]  seeds this is control it's how authoritarians control people is by controlling the economy
[1:16:03.480 --> 1:16:09.880]  third world nations make the decision in most cases to keep people poor as a tool of control
[1:16:09.880 --> 1:16:18.680]  called serfdom called feudalism it's called being chattel america was the idea of stopping that
[1:16:18.680 --> 1:16:24.040]  doesn't mean we were ever perfect about doing it but we were the idea of stopping it
[1:16:27.080 --> 1:16:31.800]  and so now here we are with it coming out i have the documents right here i'll show them to you in
[1:16:31.800 --> 1:16:40.120]  a moment that joe biden and obama ordered unmasking and the spying on general flin and
[1:16:40.120 --> 1:16:43.480]  president trump when he was president elect and now it's all come out that obama lied
[1:16:43.480 --> 1:16:49.080]  and now trump's saying he wants him called before congress to answer for this but trump
[1:16:49.080 --> 1:16:53.640]  needs to understand that billa melinda gates represent the big foundation money
[1:16:54.920 --> 1:17:00.920]  that trump was never part of and the real shadow globalist government that set up the un and they're
[1:17:00.920 --> 1:17:06.040]  making their move with this covet 19 and that now that he's sidelining valchi and now that all this
[1:17:06.040 --> 1:17:10.680]  is coming out he's got to come out and expose the fake test now they count all the regular deaths
[1:17:10.680 --> 1:17:16.040]  as covet and he's got to fully destroy the lie or they're going to keep the blue cities and states
[1:17:16.040 --> 1:17:19.960]  shut down and cause a global depression that's going to be much worse than it already is
[1:17:21.640 --> 1:17:26.360]  and so only leveling with people will stop this and i've seen a lot of signs that trump's
[1:17:26.360 --> 1:17:30.760]  starting to do that so this is an epic moment it's an incredibly dangerous moment the energy
[1:17:30.760 --> 1:17:37.560]  level politically spiritually is just pegging right now it's an 11 with your spinal tap analogy
[1:17:37.560 --> 1:17:44.440]  so now is the time to be super aggressive now is the time to be out front the good news is
[1:17:45.960 --> 1:17:49.480]  internal polls the white house did are mirrored by seeing an internal polls that's why they're
[1:17:49.480 --> 1:17:55.240]  panicking young people are totally turning to trump despite the fact we're banned everywhere
[1:17:55.240 --> 1:18:01.000]  our traffic's five times what it was it's just exploding right now so that's another good indicator
[1:18:01.800 --> 1:18:06.520]  that that that that they really miscalculated yeah they may have half the people want to be sheeple
[1:18:06.520 --> 1:18:11.880]  and think of their heroes we're staying inside but a large portion of folks for every race color
[1:18:11.880 --> 1:18:18.600]  and creed get the scam and they know what's going on so back in january of 2017 we exposed the
[1:18:18.600 --> 1:18:23.320]  president being spied on and cnn attacked us so did late night comedy and then about a year later
[1:18:23.320 --> 1:18:28.760]  roger shone and i broke it all down here's a part of that special report one thing that happens when
[1:18:28.760 --> 1:18:33.160]  you make as many wild unproven claims as trump does is that the people around you have to go to
[1:18:33.160 --> 1:18:37.640]  increasingly ridiculous lengths to try to defend those claims and this weekend we saw another
[1:18:37.640 --> 1:18:42.120]  example of that when white house counselor kelly and conway was asked if she had any proof for
[1:18:42.120 --> 1:18:47.080]  trumps outlandish claim that obama wire tapped him during the campaign and offered this bizarre
[1:18:47.080 --> 1:18:52.200]  answer how does he know that that it act that his phone was actually tapped let me answer that
[1:18:52.200 --> 1:18:56.520]  globally he's the president of the united states he has information and intelligence that the rest
[1:18:56.520 --> 1:19:01.320]  of us do not you know what yeah i'll i'll agree with that trump has intelligence that i definitely
[1:19:01.320 --> 1:19:09.400]  do not i agree listen people one more time trumps accusation is ridiculous and pathetic he is
[1:19:09.400 --> 1:19:14.440]  suggesting a u.s president enlisted a foreign intelligence service to spy on a political
[1:19:14.440 --> 1:19:19.240]  adversary that is an explosive charge this is a serious allegation this might be the most
[1:19:19.240 --> 1:19:24.840]  serious allegation any president has made against a previous president but this is a very serious
[1:19:24.840 --> 1:19:29.480]  allegation for sitting president to make about his predecessor some tweeted terrible just found
[1:19:29.480 --> 1:19:35.320]  out that obama had my wires tapped in trump tower just before the victory nothing found this is
[1:19:35.320 --> 1:19:40.600]  macartheism and the other one how low has president obama gone to tap my phones during the very
[1:19:40.600 --> 1:19:46.840]  sacred election process this is nixon watergate bad or sick guy he said obama is either a bad
[1:19:47.400 --> 1:19:53.640]  or sick guy maybe he means his compliments like yeah man he's bad he's a bad guy the nsa's deputy
[1:19:53.640 --> 1:19:59.480]  director told the bbc it was aren't nonsense revealing a complete lack of understanding in
[1:19:59.480 --> 1:20:05.560]  how the relationship works and for their part gchq called the accusations utterly ridiculous
[1:20:05.560 --> 1:20:10.840]  and yet rather than distancing himself from spicer trump decided to back him up the craziest thing
[1:20:10.840 --> 1:20:16.280]  about trump calling for an investigation without any evidence zero evidence trump has not produced
[1:20:16.280 --> 1:20:21.080]  a shred of evidence there is no evidence for trump's claims the there what the evidence did not come
[1:20:21.080 --> 1:20:27.080]  so where did trump get his info from the cia from the fbi where are you getting this information
[1:20:27.080 --> 1:20:34.120]  from a very reputable source what the fbi the cia info wars it's a radio show hosted by alex jones
[1:20:34.920 --> 1:20:40.680]  you know he's legit this bizarre circular thing happening where the president cites a theory that
[1:20:40.680 --> 1:20:46.040]  he was wiretapped which developed on the kind of fringe right wing media and then after his tweet
[1:20:46.040 --> 1:20:50.360]  storm info wars then started saying well look it was the new york times that reported it citing our
[1:20:50.360 --> 1:20:56.040]  story misreading our story and now a few weeks later the white house and the president are citing
[1:20:57.400 --> 1:21:01.800]  info wars so they've got one kind of bizarre right wing fringe theory to defend another bizarre
[1:21:01.800 --> 1:21:06.120]  right wing fringe theory both of which there's no evidence to support major developments again
[1:21:06.120 --> 1:21:11.880]  tonight on the deep state spying on the trump campaign james clapper barack obama's former
[1:21:11.880 --> 1:21:17.960]  director of national intelligence is actually today saying it was a good thing that the trump
[1:21:17.960 --> 1:21:24.760]  campaign had a spy for the fbi in their campaign during an election it turns out according to
[1:21:24.760 --> 1:21:31.400]  new reports the fbi may have had a spy in or interacting with the trump campaign during the
[1:21:31.400 --> 1:21:37.160]  2016 election a government spy in the campaign remember when trump was ridiculed by everyone
[1:21:37.160 --> 1:21:42.760]  when he said they you know i was wiretapped he speaks in shorthand at twitter i was wiretapped
[1:21:42.760 --> 1:21:46.280]  or whatever that tweet was he meant surveilled yeah he meant surveilled he was right he was
[1:21:46.280 --> 1:21:50.040]  absolutely right judge andrew napolitano they trashed him right here on fox was the first one
[1:21:50.040 --> 1:21:58.040]  to call this look this has to be seen in context not only did they use a phony fabricated dossier
[1:21:58.040 --> 1:22:04.840]  as the underlying legal rationale for the spying on the republican candidate for president using
[1:22:04.840 --> 1:22:09.960]  the power and the authority and the capability of the state to spy on one of the two major party
[1:22:09.960 --> 1:22:15.480]  candidates and abuse of power but now they infiltrated the trump campaign with a fbi agent
[1:22:15.480 --> 1:22:21.480]  and this makes watergate look like small potatoes this is watergate on steroids remember the nixon
[1:22:21.480 --> 1:22:28.360]  scandal it was about a third rate burglary this is a deep state political hit job now spying on
[1:22:28.360 --> 1:22:35.960]  an opposition party campaign fbi spies during an election a human intelligence asset may have been
[1:22:35.960 --> 1:22:43.000]  inserted in your political rivals campaign i mean how this is in front page news on every newspaper
[1:22:43.000 --> 1:22:50.120]  across the globe is stunning we have a cabal of fbi agents who took it upon themselves to investigate
[1:22:50.120 --> 1:22:56.680]  a candidate in his campaign and then we have of course actual spies one or more in the trump
[1:22:56.680 --> 1:23:01.240]  campaign what the hell is this the soviet union venezuela it's the united states of america if
[1:23:01.240 --> 1:23:05.800]  that's the case this is not america we don't have a constitution this is something you'd expect from
[1:23:05.800 --> 1:23:11.160]  the former soviet union venezuela i'm not saying this as a republican or conservative
[1:23:11.160 --> 1:23:16.360]  i find it frightening that the power of the federal government could be used in this manner
[1:23:16.360 --> 1:23:23.080]  and in the middle of a political season with spurious or scant evidence all right folks uh
[1:23:23.080 --> 1:23:28.520]  for tv viewers here it is unclassified office of director of natural intelligence may 13 2020
[1:23:28.520 --> 1:23:33.640]  they just released it as you know and here it is joe biden all of spying uh and the white house
[1:23:33.640 --> 1:23:39.480]  spying on trump so uh yeah next year's news today you bet by the way our source on all this
[1:23:39.480 --> 1:23:44.440]  was the former director of operations for the nsa William benny so yeah that's where we get this
[1:23:44.440 --> 1:23:52.040]  unfounded stuff the america that we've known and loved the america that was the land of the free
[1:23:52.040 --> 1:23:58.760]  home of the brave is dying right now and everything our enemies are doing is about domesticating us
[1:23:58.760 --> 1:24:04.120]  shutting us down and making us dependent on them the food shortages have begun the depression is
[1:24:04.120 --> 1:24:08.760]  going to be long and very very serious in fact it's probably too late now to even turn back trump
[1:24:08.760 --> 1:24:13.640]  try to stop it but the mainstream media working with the tricombs blocked it that's why you and
[1:24:13.640 --> 1:24:19.400]  myself everybody else has to get prepared now do not wait it's not about the virus it's about the

[1:25:01.240 --> 1:25:07.560]  friend of the death of civilization and the death of the human species the moment of truth is now
[1:25:07.560 --> 1:25:13.240]  here we are facing the post-human era and i've been warning you for many years that they would use
[1:25:13.240 --> 1:25:21.560]  a global viral crisis to click put us in the cage and then roll out the robot takeover this is just
[1:25:21.560 --> 1:25:28.680]  the beta test china is moving out of beta and into operational control in just a few years
[1:25:28.680 --> 1:25:34.760]  we will be under full globalist control forced inoculations total surveillance we're all being
[1:25:34.760 --> 1:25:42.440]  taught that we are obsolete the term they use is non-essential this is not some dystopian novel
[1:25:42.440 --> 1:25:50.520]  this is reality this is the new world order this is satanism what info wars has been able to do
[1:25:50.520 --> 1:25:55.960]  thanks to your support and your prayers and your word of mouth has been nothing short of historic
[1:25:55.960 --> 1:26:04.360]  and truly epic this is the battle for the future of humanity and now open world government is being
[1:26:04.360 --> 1:26:12.600]  established with an end game to depopulate the planet now the internal operations of the globalists
[1:26:12.600 --> 1:26:19.000]  are being externalized you must decide which side you're on living in denial having mass
[1:26:19.000 --> 1:26:26.360]  Stockholm syndrome learned out was this will only deliver you into misery destruction and finally death
[1:26:26.360 --> 1:26:32.360]  and this is a spiritual death we're talking about not just a physical death the delusions must end
[1:26:32.360 --> 1:26:39.320]  now info wars was correct about it all and we have come so far by exposing the enemy most people
[1:26:39.320 --> 1:26:44.840]  that are aware of the new world order decide to join it out of fear they are truly fools we must fight
[1:26:44.840 --> 1:26:53.560]  this or lose our souls you're listening to the alex jones show

[1:30:32.520 --> 1:30:38.120]  we thought you were crazy hey i i know i sound crazy the truth is insane i don't blame folks
[1:30:38.120 --> 1:30:43.240]  that thought i was full of crap because it's insane that you would actually have this going on
[1:30:43.240 --> 1:30:49.800]  this is what one of the women said this is what the new york times says they want banned
[1:30:49.800 --> 1:30:56.840]  they they're saying we will shut her up the combination of march april has been comparable
[1:30:56.840 --> 1:31:02.840]  to a bad acid trip that never ends after 24 years my perception of reality has been shattered
[1:31:03.720 --> 1:31:08.200]  work feels pointless life feels pointless i feel dehumanized the people around me
[1:31:08.200 --> 1:31:14.040]  suddenly seem dull and brainwashed because they're not tied into god sweetheart television has lost
[1:31:14.040 --> 1:31:20.680]  its appeal exactly you're you're opening up to the universe i fluctuate between hating myself
[1:31:20.680 --> 1:31:26.200]  for being so oblivious 24 years that's that's natural that's healthy and then wishing i'd never
[1:31:26.200 --> 1:31:31.800]  learned any of this in the first place i feel alone and almost psychotic to realize how much the world
[1:31:31.800 --> 1:31:38.680]  around me has been built on lies and me questioning my own sanity on a daily basis there's a reason
[1:31:38.680 --> 1:31:44.040]  most people choose to stay brainwashed reality is awful when you realize who actually runs the world
[1:31:44.040 --> 1:31:49.560]  and how limited your freedom actually is there are some doors that can't be closed
[1:31:52.920 --> 1:31:57.800]  that's only phase one fight back you're going to be exhilarated but yeah you're seeing how
[1:31:57.800 --> 1:32:02.920]  sinful you are i don't mean sin like you have sex or you drink a beer i mean you've been going

[1:32:29.640 --> 1:32:35.560]  you look at these satanists like zuckerberg and and and engage their pathetic they look like
[1:32:35.560 --> 1:32:41.800]  slaves because they are slaves all their money and all their power is nothing but a big weight

[1:32:57.240 --> 1:33:01.320]  they're coming the new york time says if you don't take a shot you don't have a job or fly on an
[1:33:01.320 --> 1:33:07.160]  airplane and the big tech companies are illegally spying on you with governments to see if you're
[1:33:07.160 --> 1:33:11.400]  social distancing and now the billable and the gates foundation with the global initiative of
[1:33:11.400 --> 1:33:18.680]  the clintons chaired by jelsie has access to all this data from big tech and is tracking you in
[1:33:18.680 --> 1:33:25.720]  real time and creating a million person army of young power tripping leftists to come to your
[1:33:25.720 --> 1:33:29.720]  house and take your children from you and it's already happening in australia
[1:33:32.360 --> 1:33:39.160]  you're like well that'll cause a civil war that's the plan so let's stop them now politically
[1:33:39.160 --> 1:33:43.320]  before they get the war they want because they know intellectually we're beating them they know
[1:33:43.320 --> 1:33:48.120]  spiritually we're beating them so what do you do when you're losing a chess game you turn the
[1:33:48.120 --> 1:33:53.640]  table over if you're a jerk and that's what this whole thing is but as long as we expose it they're
[1:33:53.640 --> 1:33:57.000]  the ones that bankrupted the economy they're the ones at the lockdown they're the ones that lied
[1:33:57.000 --> 1:34:02.840]  about the covet numbers they're the ones that as long as we expose them no one wants to read their
[1:34:02.840 --> 1:34:08.840]  propaganda brian stelter puts out a tweet he gets like a hundred retweets some random house
[1:34:08.840 --> 1:34:13.480]  wife telling the truth puts it out she gets five million then they ban her doesn't matter

[1:34:46.040 --> 1:34:54.120]  that realization that will make you blossom god's waiting god's not like satan that comes up and

[1:35:27.480 --> 1:35:32.840]  wish you could save them but you can't save them because they won't let their heart open up

[1:41:18.360 --> 1:41:24.040]  one of your calls right now president trump just came out and made another statement i was getting
[1:41:24.040 --> 1:41:31.640]  a cup of coffee watched it because he came off air force one saying the democrats don't want to
[1:41:31.640 --> 1:41:36.680]  open the economy it's political it's about making me lose the election he's being attacked for that
[1:41:36.680 --> 1:41:41.800]  the democrats admit that's what they're doing but it's deeper than that it's the globalist it's the
[1:41:41.800 --> 1:41:47.240]  chai comes he has to go on the offense about the fake numbers the fake testing how they're counting
[1:41:47.240 --> 1:41:53.800]  all the dead as this if you look at the statistics we're right at where you'd be normally for death
[1:41:53.800 --> 1:42:01.560]  each day from where we were last year the old people dying nobody likes it it's the facts of
[1:42:01.560 --> 1:42:07.320]  life they just move that over in the column and i know as listeners you know that but if we don't
[1:42:07.320 --> 1:42:13.400]  get that out we're gonna have real death in the fourth hour we break that down there's a big article
[1:42:13.400 --> 1:42:19.720]  on info wars calm how many asians how many africans have to starve to death for the left to defeat
[1:42:19.720 --> 1:42:26.760]  trump i don't just go off polls because most of them are fake but they have internal polls that
[1:42:26.760 --> 1:42:29.960]  are going on and i've been talking to folks that are involved doing them
[1:42:35.640 --> 1:42:39.080]  when the democrats came out in the last two weeks to blame trump it backfired
[1:42:39.080 --> 1:42:44.520]  because everybody knows it came from china everybody is now wearing it fouchies involved and
[1:42:44.520 --> 1:42:51.880]  bill gates is involved and the internet's done its job even with the censorship people now know
[1:42:52.920 --> 1:42:55.080]  and they know trump it didn't his fault
[1:42:57.960 --> 1:43:01.240]  and now everybody's talking about all the people starving to death 300 000 a day the
[1:43:01.240 --> 1:43:06.200]  un says is that number accurate yeah that's how many people they're on this planet there's seven
[1:43:06.200 --> 1:43:11.480]  and a half billion folks there's normally about 100 000 starving to death every week or so it's
[1:43:11.480 --> 1:43:14.200]  300 000 a day right now yeah
[1:43:18.200 --> 1:43:24.600]  they get debilitated they get malnutrition you get a common cold u d i e
[1:43:24.600 --> 1:43:36.680]  and every leftist i talk to is a sicko they're not they use race to control everybody when you
[1:43:36.680 --> 1:43:40.280]  get down to brass tax they'll tell you when you go to one of these abortion clinics to protest
[1:43:40.840 --> 1:43:44.520]  and i told you about this 20 years ago before there was video now there's all these videos
[1:43:44.520 --> 1:43:49.320]  where you'll have an asian or black doctor walk out and go i can't even quote her they'll take
[1:43:49.320 --> 1:43:54.360]  it out of context and say i said look i'm out and say you know nobody wants these black people
[1:43:54.360 --> 1:43:58.760]  what are you going to adopt them we need to get rid of these people i mean you've seen this attitude
[1:44:03.400 --> 1:44:11.480]  totally riding off people and and and that's what this is folks that's what all this sick
[1:44:11.480 --> 1:44:17.080]  behavior is and for me it's not some virtuous signal to be against it i'm not into killing kids
[1:44:17.080 --> 1:44:23.400]  man and i'm not signing on to it because i'm not going to hell be like oh hell doesn't exist bill
[1:44:23.400 --> 1:44:28.600]  gates oh there's no god yeah right because you think you're god and you're playing god there is a god
[1:44:28.600 --> 1:44:39.480]  and you're gonna burn for it buddy i've seen hell yeah i'll leave it at that and it's the absence of
[1:44:39.480 --> 1:44:46.360]  god truth is god doesn't have to be anything these evil people he just dumps them all in together
[1:44:46.360 --> 1:44:54.760]  can you imagine being for eternity locked up with bill gates and hillary clinton i'll take
[1:44:54.760 --> 1:45:03.320]  a lake of fire over that any day but it's a burning because they love death they want to burn up creation
[1:45:06.040 --> 1:45:07.400]  so the burning is them
[1:45:07.400 --> 1:45:19.080]  and look how pathetic steven cobert is what a sack of garbage he is what a fake plastic
[1:45:19.080 --> 1:45:27.560]  piece of filth he is big buddies with john and tony podesta a slimy sack of crap
[1:45:30.040 --> 1:45:36.520]  look at his eyes he thinks he's so important two sick fake demons talking about the collapse
[1:45:36.520 --> 1:45:43.080]  of society giggling and laughing because it's a joke on us jokes on you buddy you think you're
[1:45:43.080 --> 1:45:50.200]  going to get away with this without god tarot you metaphysically live from lamb you're stupid
[1:45:51.400 --> 1:45:57.080]  so you keep having your fun and keep smiling because you're not going to be smiling forever jack

[1:46:09.160 --> 1:46:13.800]  how are you great to get through to you i'm all right i'm pretty fired up i see you're talking
[1:46:13.800 --> 1:46:17.960]  about families the children being grabbed other homes let's show footage around the world of them
[1:46:17.960 --> 1:46:21.720]  grabbing little kids away from their mothers because they dare go outside if you work at a big
[1:46:21.720 --> 1:46:25.320]  store you're allowed to be outside but if you're just an average person you stay in your house and
[1:46:25.320 --> 1:46:33.000]  you die exactly this is what this is exactly what i'm calling about um a couple weeks ago the world
[1:46:33.000 --> 1:46:38.680]  was shocked when we heard the who director Pedro state that we need to go to look into families
[1:46:38.680 --> 1:46:45.800]  and remove family members with dignity now we have a broward county florida administrator
[1:46:45.800 --> 1:46:52.760]  her name is bertha henry she's making the same statements oh yeah and now billa melinda gates
[1:46:52.760 --> 1:46:58.520]  with the clinton foundation with chelsea runs it have a computer program with apple and google
[1:46:58.520 --> 1:47:04.280]  where they just decide they're now saying if you were around someone with covet we're going to
[1:47:04.280 --> 1:47:09.240]  take your children so they want to get us used to the image of the police taking our children away
[1:47:09.240 --> 1:47:14.120]  and are the cops dumb enough to be part of this looks like they are well some of them are actually
[1:47:14.120 --> 1:47:19.320]  i am a law enforcement officer and i'm uh i'm appalled at what's going on by the way i'm not
[1:47:19.320 --> 1:47:24.040]  kissing your ass on average cops are more likely general public but i was talking about australia
[1:47:24.040 --> 1:47:28.840]  absolutely so what are you a you don't want to do that morally b how dangerous is that when you
[1:47:28.840 --> 1:47:36.200]  start going out take kids well um what i'm calling about specifically is on tuesday
[1:47:36.760 --> 1:47:44.440]  the broward county uh county council they had a zoom workshop and bertha henry who's an
[1:47:44.440 --> 1:47:52.200]  unelected county administrator she's the one not not the samples she's the one who ordered our
[1:47:52.200 --> 1:47:58.360]  businesses closed she's the one who ordered us to wear masks he's the one who who um closed our
[1:47:58.360 --> 1:48:04.920]  beaches and closed our parks he's the one who collects 347 thousand dollars a year she made
[1:48:04.920 --> 1:48:12.280]  statements that we're going to start going into family homes and separate individuals and isolate
[1:48:12.280 --> 1:48:20.280]  them and um you know broward county is the most liberal county in the great state of florida and
[1:48:20.280 --> 1:48:26.120]  it's a great state we do have a great governor and we need the people here to wake up um i think
[1:48:26.120 --> 1:48:30.040]  you absolutely do you have an obvious i don't need to tell you your job you realize how dangerous
[1:48:30.040 --> 1:48:35.240]  that is if you start going grabbing people's kids well i would never do that no i know but there
[1:48:35.240 --> 1:48:39.960]  are some police that will follow that order there are some who have been doing it and uh you know

[1:49:24.840 --> 1:49:30.920]  australia whether it's the u.s they want contact tracing where bureaucrats in the democratic party
[1:49:31.640 --> 1:49:37.400]  call you and then are the non-governmental boss of the police and then order you who to go grab
[1:49:37.400 --> 1:49:44.280]  can you imagine how ripe for abuse that's going to be it's it's it's appalling i understand who
[1:49:44.280 --> 1:49:53.880]  runs this um i understand that if hr666 passes we'll have a hundred billion dollars a year
[1:49:54.760 --> 1:50:01.160]  for these corrupt for these corrupt bureaucrats like bertha henry she'll be paid off
[1:50:01.160 --> 1:50:07.640]  just carry this out to play god stop this and again anyone that's ever had a normal cold has
[1:50:07.640 --> 1:50:12.600]  has the antibodies for covid 19 so it makes everybody suspect isn't this a genius takeover
[1:50:12.600 --> 1:50:20.040]  plan i have friends who are nurses who work in the covid woods here in um in broward county
[1:50:20.040 --> 1:50:26.920]  hospitals and what they tell me is it's a complete total host we've got a hospital here that there
[1:50:26.920 --> 1:50:32.360]  are three patients in there that came from nursing homes and they're not even sick they're not sick
[1:50:32.360 --> 1:50:37.960]  other than normal ailments that people in their 80s sure exactly well again people are like well
[1:50:37.960 --> 1:50:43.800]  why would they choose something like a cold virus because everybody's got it and so now
[1:50:43.800 --> 1:50:48.840]  everyone is suspect so every death they can say is that and they can throttle it up or throttle it

[1:51:20.040 --> 1:51:27.160]  that caller he sounds credible but trust me verify i already know it's all true and imagine
[1:51:27.160 --> 1:51:33.160]  oh google said you were around somebody had covid we're coming to take your kids away it's gonna
[1:51:33.160 --> 1:51:43.400]  start a civil war folks we are 170 days out from the 2020 election it is a referendum of national
[1:51:43.400 --> 1:51:48.920]  sovereignty against globalism and obama hillary and the deep state have been caught attempting to
[1:51:48.920 --> 1:51:54.680]  overthrow president trump's election and they've been caught in two separate coup attempts against
[1:51:54.680 --> 1:52:00.040]  the president now they've been pushing covid 19 to shut down the economy and create a depression
[1:52:00.040 --> 1:52:05.240]  while china has already been open for business for more than a month this is an ongoing globalist
[1:52:05.240 --> 1:52:10.520]  attempt to punish the american people wreck our economy and hope that we won't recognize that it
[1:52:10.520 --> 1:52:16.280]  is they the new world order that have orchestrated this and not president trump they know their crimes
[1:52:16.280 --> 1:52:21.640]  are coming out they know the chickens are coming home to roost so now they're panicking and trying
[1:52:21.640 --> 1:52:27.960]  to steal the 2020 election with mail-in ballots based on keeping the public safe from covid 19
[1:52:27.960 --> 1:52:35.000]  the entire covid 19 system is a giant hopes and must be exposed if america has any hope so get out
[1:52:35.000 --> 1:52:44.520]  there and expose this fraud this is the end my friends my only friends the end of our elaborate
[1:52:44.520 --> 1:52:53.160]  plans the end of everything that stands the end the safety the delusion it's all over ladies and
[1:52:53.160 --> 1:53:01.080]  gentlemen because there was only the mirage of safety movies and partying and living like children
[1:53:01.080 --> 1:53:06.760]  never growing up ever caring about other people this delivered us into the hands of tyranny
[1:53:07.480 --> 1:53:12.200]  just like the history books show us just like the bible states every time israel became corrupt
[1:53:12.200 --> 1:53:19.480]  evil and turned away from god never brought into captivity because their people sold out to special
[1:53:19.480 --> 1:53:25.160]  interest and were infiltrated by spies and then they were enslaved we are repeating that again
[1:53:25.160 --> 1:53:32.760]  today compliance and going along with this system leads to absolute bondage info wars has decided
[1:53:32.760 --> 1:53:37.560]  to fight for freedom info wars is a great victory thanks to your support and your prayers
[1:53:37.560 --> 1:53:43.640]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[1:53:48.200 --> 1:53:55.160]  what i hate is looking out and seeing kim trails in a clear blue sky today
[1:53:55.160 --> 1:54:08.600]  what i hate is hitting roadblocks on a highway in my way
[1:54:14.040 --> 1:54:23.000]  what i live for is a chance to change and be humanity or thing i can be has been asleep but
[1:54:23.000 --> 1:54:28.440]  we're awakening and the technocrats that think they're so powerful are about to get their asses
[1:54:28.440 --> 1:54:33.000]  handed to them we're taking your phone calls right now you heard a police officer calling from
[1:54:33.000 --> 1:54:38.040]  broward county where they're it i don't just believe the caller he's not incredible i look
[1:54:38.040 --> 1:54:41.480]  it's there that they're trying to train them for gun confiscation they're trying to train them for
[1:54:41.480 --> 1:54:45.560]  round up people's kids they're trying to train them for checkpoints i mean it's going on all over the
[1:54:45.560 --> 1:54:56.760]  country and i even got a clip of the mayor of chicago pledging pledging allegiance to the
[1:54:56.760 --> 1:55:02.280]  new world order that's coming up but let's go to your calls right now who's been holding the longest
[1:55:02.280 --> 1:55:09.640]  year michael in my hometown of dallas now under democrat control michael what are you seeing up
[1:55:09.640 --> 1:55:15.640]  there in big d all right hey what's going on i got some cluster bombs that go out to you and the
[1:55:15.640 --> 1:55:20.200]  the employers here um let me get these out and i'll try to knock them off real fast so you can
[1:55:20.200 --> 1:55:25.000]  comment or ask questions or whatever but um first one is i know you're aware of event 201 but in
[1:55:25.000 --> 1:55:30.440]  section seven on the website for event 201 as well as on their youtube channel there's a youtube called
[1:55:30.440 --> 1:55:37.640]  un chief on covid 19 and misinformation that section seven talks about the need to flood the
[1:55:37.640 --> 1:55:44.680]  media and the need for a public private partnership to flood uh and and overcome all the misinformation
[1:55:44.680 --> 1:55:50.760]  and disinformation uh so as to offset you know truth basically right and oh yeah the new york
[1:55:50.760 --> 1:55:55.880]  times is saying you know censor everyone flood them make the americans submit and they say the
[1:55:55.880 --> 1:56:01.320]  who's the boss so we're under un global government attack the course we're doing under the medical
[1:56:01.320 --> 1:56:07.560]  banner oh the medical people we can trust them yeah and and i learned about that through event
[1:56:07.560 --> 1:56:12.600]  202 you can look that up as well on youtube is a good good uh good thing the other thing is um i
[1:56:12.600 --> 1:56:17.240]  know you're familiar with of course the rock of feller foundation and all that all that stuff
[1:56:17.240 --> 1:56:22.280]  doing but right right around right around the turn of the century um when when they gave us the
[1:56:22.280 --> 1:56:27.320]  irs and the federal reserve they actually overtook the medical community and kind of hijacked that
[1:56:27.320 --> 1:56:31.640]  and um if you look up the there was actually a battle between glue pastures germ theory and
[1:56:31.640 --> 1:56:38.600]  terrain theory now there was an interview that um david eich uh helped make possible because he he
[1:56:38.600 --> 1:56:43.320]  talked to the gentleman who does london real uh and andy kaufman got on there there's there's
[1:56:43.320 --> 1:56:47.960]  really a lot to be discussed there because it boils down to whether germs cause these things
[1:56:47.960 --> 1:56:51.560]  or whether they come from within right and so that really begs the question what's really
[1:56:51.560 --> 1:56:59.960]  going on here look up stefan lanka s t e f a n lanka a l a n k a he's got a germany he's a doctor
[1:56:59.960 --> 1:57:05.480]  and he warned in german supreme court showing that measles virus does not exist he warned a supreme
[1:57:05.480 --> 1:57:10.520]  court um decision on this because somebody challenged him he threw down the gauntlet this
[1:57:10.520 --> 1:57:17.880]  is a big longstanding hundred year plus uh misinformation campaign that that germ that
[1:57:17.880 --> 1:57:22.520]  viruses are coming from outside of us they come from within us so they'll look up terrain theory
[1:57:22.520 --> 1:57:26.840]  and i'd be really interested in hearing your thoughts on that well i mean all these different
[1:57:26.840 --> 1:57:31.320]  schools of thoughts always fight with each other and some schools of thoughts have no validity
[1:57:31.320 --> 1:57:37.080]  others have a mix of validity some are under deep study end up in you're pretty much right obviously
[1:57:37.080 --> 1:57:42.680]  viruses come from within you because the virus is going to the cells and program the mitochondria
[1:57:42.680 --> 1:57:49.640]  to mass produce the virus and so a compromised or diseased person um is going to be easier for
[1:57:49.640 --> 1:57:55.080]  viruses to go into and replicate and turn your body into a factory it's an outside force coming
[1:57:55.080 --> 1:58:00.680]  in and programming so there's there's truth in both those schools of thought i don't think one
[1:58:00.680 --> 1:58:06.280]  school of thought of the other uh is uh accurate does that make sense dig deeper dig deeper because
[1:58:06.280 --> 1:58:12.040]  there's a microbiome and and look up royal rife r i f e he was a scientist in the third no i know
[1:58:12.040 --> 1:58:17.000]  i know all about it frequencies and all that you know all about royal right yeah i mean i and i
[1:58:17.000 --> 1:58:21.000]  know the frequencies affect our bodies there you go there you go beautiful stuff needs to be
[1:58:21.000 --> 1:58:31.400]  odd brother i appreciate your call all right jeremy cj nathan glenn robert and derrick your calls
[1:58:31.400 --> 1:58:38.600]  are t minus 60 seconds away but whatever you do don't tell folks attuned to the program we don't
[1:58:38.600 --> 1:58:49.240]  want to defeat the club just keep info war secret the panic that has been orchestrated by the global
[1:58:49.240 --> 1:58:56.120]  corporatist media and the chai comms is going to now trigger a worldwide depression in fact we're
[1:58:56.120 --> 1:59:01.160]  already into the worldwide depression and the death sentence for the third world but it's critical
[1:59:01.160 --> 1:59:08.360]  to understand that the longer the shutdown persists the worse it's going to be a month of shutdown
[1:59:08.360 --> 1:59:13.480]  will destroy decades of wealth that's been built up in a complex economy that's what we've always
[1:59:13.480 --> 1:59:17.960]  said it's important to be a prepper and to be somewhat self-sufficient because the globalists
[1:59:17.960 --> 1:59:24.200]  want to make us all dependent so that we're under their control they've admitted all of this so
[1:59:24.200 --> 1:59:30.200]  remember how does info wars continue years and decades in many cases to be able to predict
[1:59:30.200 --> 1:59:35.960]  things before they happen because we're following the globalist blueprint and their battle plan and
[1:59:35.960 --> 1:59:41.560]  yes it's dystopic and yes it's scary but denying it and letting them carry it out is a thousand times
[1:59:41.560 --> 1:59:49.400]  more scary it's time to stop the denial and realize what's really happening
[1:59:53.320 --> 2:00:00.200]  crashing through the lies and disinformation it's alex jones coming to you live from the front
[2:00:00.200 --> 2:00:17.560]  lines of the info war well if you ever wanted to see taren here getting a front row seat to it
[2:00:17.560 --> 2:00:24.600]  defining out which part of the country is still america what parts aren't new york city woman handcuffed
[2:00:24.600 --> 2:00:31.880]  by police for not fully wearing her mask live media coverage of covet 19 has been so bad the
[2:00:31.880 --> 2:00:37.080]  clenched covet fist of government those are some of the stories up on info wars dot com we'll get
[2:00:37.080 --> 2:00:42.840]  to that video a little bit later but oh you're a hero if you attack people you're a hero if you
[2:00:42.840 --> 2:00:47.640]  take people to jail you're a hero if you do all this but the airlines are open people are flying
[2:00:47.640 --> 2:00:53.240]  in from all over the world with the supposed covet 19 this is creating a hysteria creating a
[2:00:53.240 --> 2:00:58.280]  mental illness because you do have deaths from the cold viruses and the flu viruses and the
[2:00:58.280 --> 2:01:02.920]  pneumonia viruses and now they're going to fetishize it and make every event a huge hysteria
[2:01:05.480 --> 2:01:11.000]  to lock down society and make us dysfunctional it's the sabotage of the human civilization
[2:01:11.000 --> 2:01:16.200]  so we accept the driverless cars and the robots delivering our food this is part of humanity
[2:01:16.200 --> 2:01:27.720]  becoming kept slaves this is the takeover let's go to glennon kansas glennon the air thanks for
[2:01:27.720 --> 2:01:36.280]  holding hi ox um we all know that one of the greatest tools of the enemy is the media the
[2:01:36.280 --> 2:01:42.600]  pandemic scam would never have been possible without the media enabling that they've they
[2:01:42.600 --> 2:01:50.200]  enable the attacks on trump they hide the vaccine damage so we need a bunch of strategies to
[2:01:50.920 --> 2:01:57.240]  take action against them i know that's what you do every day but i'm just emphasizing none of this
[2:01:57.240 --> 2:02:03.720]  these problems are possible without what they do and it's all monkeys see monkey do oh wear the mask
[2:02:03.720 --> 2:02:09.640]  and even ads on fox news show the people doing the ads from their homes it's just all like oh we're
[2:02:09.640 --> 2:02:16.200]  heroes we're doing it to stop the increase to you know cut the cut the number down and it's all made
[2:02:16.200 --> 2:02:21.240]  up and now they tell us it's never gonna end no we we're not we're never gonna go back to school

[2:02:50.200 --> 2:02:57.560]  red white and blue uh i want to know why trump don't open this back up but you said he was naive
[2:02:57.560 --> 2:03:02.280]  i'm thinking he's either incompetent or he's controlled opposition he's violated his oath of
[2:03:02.280 --> 2:03:11.080]  office by taking our steps stomping on our right well he has said he wants to totally reopen but
[2:03:11.080 --> 2:03:16.760]  what does he do with the states the counties and the cities ignore him well all these mayors and
[2:03:16.760 --> 2:03:21.960]  governors and him himself if they violate the constitution according to the constitution
[2:03:21.960 --> 2:03:27.000]  they should be removed from office immediately well actually the supreme court of wisconsin
[2:03:27.000 --> 2:03:31.800]  told the milwaukee mayor and others that you can't do a lockdown it's because it is unconstitutional
[2:03:31.800 --> 2:03:38.120]  to say you're all prisoners this is all just color of law intimidation well trump's the most
[2:03:38.120 --> 2:03:43.320]  powerful man on the earth he can change it he can stop all this he can go tell fouching gates and
[2:03:43.320 --> 2:03:48.120]  all him to go pound sand no i agree well he i'm not defending trump but i'm telling you he did
[2:03:48.120 --> 2:03:53.480]  just sideline fouchy and then look at gates and all them attacking and fouchy attacking trump so
[2:03:54.760 --> 2:03:59.560]  i mean i i hear what you're saying what do you think trump should do he should reopen this
[2:03:59.560 --> 2:04:04.200]  sucker up we get us back he should he should just honor those of the constitution none of this

[2:06:17.400 --> 2:06:22.600]  but the instant messengers is what got balasaro elected despite censorship in brazil so people
[2:06:22.600 --> 2:06:28.040]  are finding ways to get around all this right now and people are very hungry for the truth cj thank
[2:06:28.040 --> 2:06:34.920]  you so much god bless you sir okay let's take another phone call here who's up next let's talk
[2:06:34.920 --> 2:06:41.320]  to nathan in michigan another caller from michigan go ahead hey how's it going alex i'm all right man
[2:06:41.320 --> 2:06:48.920]  crazy times three things i want to say and then i got a question for you at the end so first thing
[2:06:48.920 --> 2:06:57.000]  uh i had a teacher uh i'm in school at henry ford for uh biotechnology so i had a professor
[2:06:57.000 --> 2:07:04.360]  that actually worked at the wuhan lab and you know of course he said uh oh no it came for a bat
[2:07:04.360 --> 2:07:08.760]  from a bat of course he gave me a look like you really want to think i'm going to tell you what
[2:07:08.760 --> 2:07:18.040]  really happened but uh so i i actually uh took it upon myself to uh go and interview the hospitals
[2:07:18.040 --> 2:07:27.960]  in this area and uh when i went to go upload it it only let me on facebook upload uh garden city
[2:07:27.960 --> 2:07:35.640]  hospital which supposedly they have covid patients there but i went to the two other ones and uh i
[2:07:35.640 --> 2:07:44.840]  went to uh one was closed and i got a video of a woman there saying we're completely closed there
[2:07:44.840 --> 2:07:50.280]  ain't a single patient here with covid or anything else for that matter and i gotta interview with
[2:07:50.280 --> 2:07:58.040]  another hospital that uh you know the guy basically said uh we're getting our hours cut we're below
[2:07:58.040 --> 2:08:05.480]  capacity there's nothing going on here so i want to expose that and then uh another thing i did
[2:08:05.480 --> 2:08:13.000]  is on uh april 30th i was in the capital uh lansing there uh here in michigan and uh
[2:08:14.360 --> 2:08:20.120]  you know they had some q people out there and everything else um and i actually had some of
[2:08:20.120 --> 2:08:26.680]  your stickers and i left them with a sticker uh i left one on the ground by this guy had a q stand
[2:08:27.240 --> 2:08:32.360]  set up there so i left on the ground in kind of a secretive way for him to find the little
[2:08:32.360 --> 2:08:41.880]  sticker that says imqinfowars.com so uh that was fun but uh well let's go back to what you were doing
[2:08:41.880 --> 2:08:46.760]  there the fact that you're showing the hospitals empty three months ago they go oh your conspiracy
[2:08:46.760 --> 2:08:51.240]  theorist two months ago now they admit okay yeah we are empty okay it wasn't a big deal so it was
[2:08:51.240 --> 2:08:55.640]  20 30 times lower than what they said it was but now they're trying to tell us we can never reopen
[2:08:55.640 --> 2:09:01.240]  it's a power grab plain and simple we have to expose it i appreciate your call god bless you
[2:09:01.240 --> 2:09:06.200]  that's all they do is they say you're a hero because you're wearing a mask and you're not
[2:09:06.200 --> 2:09:11.240]  going out and all you're doing is bankrupting the economy so we all go into debt the bankers take
[2:09:11.240 --> 2:09:17.320]  over it's a very simple equation oh you want prosperity we'll punish you we'll show you
[2:09:18.200 --> 2:09:25.160]  all right more calls straight ahead on the other side we're gonna go to coastie and robert and
[2:09:25.160 --> 2:09:31.000]  skylar and jim and jeremy and mark and others straight ahead on the other side and then robert
[2:09:31.000 --> 2:09:36.120]  barnes on the huge developments of the flin case the deep state coup against the president and more
[2:09:36.120 --> 2:09:40.840]  he'll be in studio coming up to talk about that and then elon shroyer takes over with the war room
[2:09:40.840 --> 2:09:47.960]  at 3 p.m. central standard time i've hunted a lot of big game at long distances with high caliber
[2:09:47.960 --> 2:09:54.120]  rifles and when you shoot an elk it's a 600 yards even if you hit them right in the heart
[2:09:54.120 --> 2:10:02.600]  they'll still run 50 60 70 maybe 100 yards they've got that adrenaline pumping through their arteries
[2:10:02.600 --> 2:10:07.000]  and through their veins but all of a sudden they slow down they realize what's happened
[2:10:07.000 --> 2:10:13.080]  they fall over and they die then you go back and then haul them back in well that's what's
[2:10:13.080 --> 2:10:19.560]  going to happen to the entire world now and that's what the economic numbers show is that we've been
[2:10:19.560 --> 2:10:25.240]  shot right in the heart and for the first world it's going to mean a long horrible depression
[2:10:25.240 --> 2:10:29.400]  and a lot of death well for the third world it's going to mean probably over a hundred million
[2:10:29.400 --> 2:10:34.680]  dead according to you and i believe their numbers because it's the very un that's orchestrated this
[2:10:34.680 --> 2:10:38.520]  to depopulate the third world so that all the leftists that thought it was their revolution
[2:10:38.520 --> 2:10:42.680]  to get rid of trump you're a bunch of suckers and you bought into something better than what hitler
[2:10:42.680 --> 2:10:48.200]  did one of our best-selling products is living defense and it's been sold out for over four
[2:10:48.200 --> 2:10:52.520]  months because it's hard to source the ingredients that are organic we've got a limited supply right
[2:10:52.520 --> 2:10:56.520]  now that's selling out fast and i want those of you that haven't experienced living defense
[2:10:56.520 --> 2:11:01.400]  to get it for yourself here's just part of one testimonial i looked in january 2016 i went in a
[2:11:01.400 --> 2:11:06.200]  hospital i went to va hospital out here in boise and i was in there until june and one of the only
[2:11:06.200 --> 2:11:11.800]  things that got me through that ordeal was listening to info wars three hours a day and i kept here in
[2:11:11.800 --> 2:11:16.840]  dr group and all you guys talking about living defense let me tell you something i had an internal
[2:11:16.840 --> 2:11:21.800]  digestive problem and i suffered with it for about five or six years and the doctors they tried
[2:11:21.800 --> 2:11:25.880]  every time nobody could figure out what it is and then every day when i kept hearing you and
[2:11:25.880 --> 2:11:29.720]  dr group and those commercials i said you know what i'm gonna get me some of that freaking living
[2:11:29.720 --> 2:11:32.840]  defense now i wasn't supposed to have any nutritional because they don't want you to have
[2:11:32.840 --> 2:11:37.640]  a stuff but i ordered it had it shipped to me i got it i hid it from the nurses i started taking
[2:11:37.640 --> 2:11:43.560]  it man that stuff changed my life it saved my life alex jones and info wars saved my life
[2:11:43.560 --> 2:11:49.160]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[2:11:49.160 --> 2:11:58.760]  so
[2:12:05.080 --> 2:12:10.200]  live from freedom command central it's the alex jones show
[2:12:12.520 --> 2:12:17.240]  look it really is common sense when we give up on common sense values we become slaves
[2:12:17.240 --> 2:12:23.080]  this way it works and the globalist corporate system just wants domesticated people so you're
[2:12:23.080 --> 2:12:28.040]  out of the way so they control you they don't want innovators they don't want independent people
[2:12:28.040 --> 2:12:34.200]  they don't want a middle class that's all it is and so they're like oh you're not going along
[2:12:34.200 --> 2:12:38.840]  with our new world order we'll just bankrupt the whole world economy they will say that every death
[2:12:39.800 --> 2:12:42.760]  from the common cold is the end of the world and create this fear
[2:12:42.760 --> 2:12:48.120]  here and and and sycophantically tell you how you're heroes because you go along with it
[2:12:50.760 --> 2:12:55.880]  but as mark twain said a lie goes halfway around the world before the truth puts its pants on
[2:12:59.000 --> 2:13:03.800]  and the truth's putting its pants on right now and this whole hoax is imploding faster and you
[2:13:03.800 --> 2:13:13.480]  can say lickety split coasty in california active military coast guard on covid-19 and vaccines
[2:13:13.480 --> 2:13:20.040]  what's your take on this whole globalist power grab well alex i think it's a little bit you know
[2:13:21.160 --> 2:13:26.440]  conceited of them the way they're going about everything at the same time um you know it's
[2:13:26.440 --> 2:13:31.640]  scary for me because you know being active in military they pump you full of of every vaccine
[2:13:31.640 --> 2:13:37.880]  they have um you know it's it's kind of you know been on my mind a lot you know starting to listen
[2:13:37.880 --> 2:13:42.440]  to you you know just in the past six months or so i mean the dad's been listening to you forever but
[2:13:43.000 --> 2:13:49.480]  you know i i i don't i don't know how i would go about you know denying that vaccine if i could
[2:13:49.480 --> 2:13:55.320]  even deny it because you know if it's experimental they're not even allowed to give it to the
[2:13:55.320 --> 2:13:59.720]  military but the military isn't usually aware of that so they use military as guinea pigs
[2:13:59.720 --> 2:14:04.760]  so it's wrong but the military bucked the anthrax shots and they had to stop giving them
[2:14:05.960 --> 2:14:10.920]  yeah they you know that that's what's scary because the military you know they're you
[2:14:10.920 --> 2:14:16.440]  you have this group of people who have no choice but to to be tested on to an extent i know back in
[2:14:16.440 --> 2:14:21.800]  the the 70s and 80s they were doing mind control stuff for the air force and all sorts of other
[2:14:22.520 --> 2:14:26.920]  crazy things you know what's to say they're not gonna you know the first wave of these vaccines
[2:14:26.920 --> 2:14:32.200]  tested out on the military oh i think you're absolutely right and again i'm not even defending
[2:14:32.200 --> 2:14:36.200]  the government itself the government's we the people you have compartmentalized groups that
[2:14:36.200 --> 2:14:40.120]  carry out these crimes they've been caught engaged in these crimes and that's why good people have
[2:14:40.120 --> 2:14:45.080]  to say no to stuff that's unconstitutional because just because you waive some of your rights to in
[2:14:45.080 --> 2:14:50.920]  the military you don't sign up to be a guinea pig for unapproved drugs the law is they cannot give
[2:14:50.920 --> 2:14:55.800]  you experimental vaccines yeah it's just you have to have those you have to have those people who
[2:14:55.800 --> 2:15:01.320]  are strong-willed enough and god-faring people to say no you gotta have officers that throw at the
[2:15:01.320 --> 2:15:06.440]  trash and say you took the shot it's time to stop complying the damn things don't protect you
[2:15:07.320 --> 2:15:12.200]  believe me the officers aren't taking those vaccines brother no no no it's gonna be the
[2:15:12.200 --> 2:15:16.360]  lower enlisted and unfortunately that's that's what i know they scored it the trash they tell the
[2:15:16.360 --> 2:15:23.560]  nurse you bumped up that the trash can they're not taking that stuff off as if i took it but
[2:15:23.560 --> 2:15:27.240]  you know another thing that i was saying you know the the coast guard itself has been you know
[2:15:27.960 --> 2:15:32.440]  doing a lot of publicity you know our our master chief petty officer the coast guard you know
[2:15:33.160 --> 2:15:38.360]  the highest uh ranking enlisted person posting pictures on facebook of him going and getting
[2:15:38.360 --> 2:15:44.680]  his his blood taken for this antibody stuff and it's you know trying to you know propagate it
[2:15:44.680 --> 2:15:50.600]  out there as this is a good thing guys go do it and it's just everybody's falling into the trap
[2:15:50.600 --> 2:15:56.920]  and it's it's sad to see well we've got the statistics that this doesn't kill as many people
[2:15:56.920 --> 2:16:02.120]  as the flu does so it's a giant hoax and it's about to shut down the economy god bless you i
[2:16:02.120 --> 2:16:09.000]  appreciate your call sir all right let's take another one here let's talk to uh skyler in
[2:16:09.000 --> 2:16:14.600]  washington you're on the air go ahead hey alex thanks yeah i called in to talk about obama and
[2:16:14.600 --> 2:16:18.440]  the breakthrough in general flin's case and uh thanks to your reporting and everything we know
[2:16:18.440 --> 2:16:24.360]  all roads lead to obama and is a cabal of crooks going after the trump presidency but this information
[2:16:24.360 --> 2:16:28.680]  is like a needle in a haystack right now i wanted to touch on that and also have another point about
[2:16:30.280 --> 2:16:36.600]  topic of obama yeah you're on air brother lay it off all right well i'll tell you i was i was uh
[2:16:36.600 --> 2:16:40.760]  sort of had a divine intervention moment when i was watching obama's speech at the media dinner
[2:16:40.760 --> 2:16:45.720]  there where his last words were obama out and he had his mic drop moment i thought that was
[2:16:45.720 --> 2:16:51.080]  suspicious so i did a little research and thought does obama out translate anything else and it does
[2:16:51.080 --> 2:16:57.960]  it translates to the king is dead and sudanese and yoruba and at the time i was listening to a gospel
[2:16:57.960 --> 2:17:03.640]  song that was singing the king is alive and i think jesus is king and is alive in our faith
[2:17:05.960 --> 2:17:11.240]  and enough said right however as i was researching this i also found out that obama out translates
[2:17:11.240 --> 2:17:22.200]  directly to inhaled death and sudanese and somali what do you think about that obama is a demon he
[2:17:22.200 --> 2:17:29.320]  is he is a horrible sickening filthy person and we know that he is a i mean so yeah like his first
[2:17:29.320 --> 2:17:34.200]  big speech was in kaira to launch the islamic attack on the west he got caught funding the muslim
[2:17:34.200 --> 2:17:41.240]  brotherhood out of kenya i mean he is just an absolute god hating america hating piece of trash
[2:17:42.280 --> 2:17:48.520]  yeah well i think what's going on here is that uh the enemy has enabled and kind of created a huge
[2:17:48.520 --> 2:17:54.920]  rhythmic drift cycle uh and people are caught in it right now with the economy being shut down
[2:17:54.920 --> 2:17:58.840]  oh well the average leptis even knows now it's about getting rid of trump it's a little oh we're
[2:17:58.840 --> 2:18:03.720]  all getting our money like all these big leptis universities are giving their students money back
[2:18:03.720 --> 2:18:08.680]  and they're giving the employees raises but then the average person with the business tries to go
[2:18:08.680 --> 2:18:14.600]  get the money you can't even ever get it so uh this is a giant wealth transfer by the deep state
[2:18:15.160 --> 2:18:18.120]  i know i trump tried to prop it up he believed you know he was trying to keep the economy going
[2:18:18.120 --> 2:18:22.600]  but he's been screwed at every level and it's it's a giant mess scholar god bless you appreciate the
[2:18:22.600 --> 2:18:29.800]  call jim in dallas you're on the year go ahead thank you hey um who's been screwed is the american
[2:18:29.800 --> 2:18:36.840]  people by these um power abusing government bureaucrats and just the way president trump can
[2:18:36.840 --> 2:18:40.920]  create the space force because he owns the administrative division he can do whatever he
[2:18:40.920 --> 2:18:46.120]  wants he should create a bureau of government oversight where their only job would be to protect
[2:18:46.120 --> 2:18:52.360]  citizens from these abuses of power like with the bicep stuff i agree instead of the sbi there's a
[2:18:52.360 --> 2:18:58.920]  government bureau that goes after government bureaucrats yes sir exactly boy they wouldn't
[2:18:58.920 --> 2:19:04.280]  want that would they no they wouldn't but he can do it tomorrow so he has to do is say uh
[2:19:04.280 --> 2:19:09.480]  justice department or he could use a jag core in the military um i'm assigning you this put
[2:19:09.480 --> 2:19:14.200]  10 percent or 50 percent of your budget in and he needs no approval of congress to do this this is
[2:19:14.200 --> 2:19:20.600]  why it works no you're right that's how presidents have created all these bureaucracies how about
[2:19:20.600 --> 2:19:25.240]  he gets rid of a few of the bureaucracies too that'd be good too that would be good too but this
[2:19:25.240 --> 2:19:31.720]  is to protect the citizens from those employees that we can't vote for they're there and unfortunately
[2:19:31.720 --> 2:19:37.000]  that law that they passed that makes it impossible basically to fire people in the administrative
[2:19:37.000 --> 2:19:42.760]  branch administrative bureau whatever um they stay in place and they can abuse the power just
[2:19:42.760 --> 2:19:48.120]  like the irs abuses right or other citizens like shaper cox that have had their rights ripped away
[2:19:48.120 --> 2:19:56.040]  because of these guys um the flin cases the time to do it what do you make of the judge in the flin
[2:19:56.040 --> 2:20:01.240]  case saying she may still put him in jail or he may still put him in i mean the judges never even
[2:20:01.240 --> 2:20:08.280]  had the power to do that this is like totally rogue government here it is and the only way to
[2:20:08.280 --> 2:20:13.240]  remove a guy like that is the impeachment process congress needs to get off their butt and start
[2:20:13.240 --> 2:20:19.320]  doing their oversight job and removing the judges like this guy even that even i agree because they've
[2:20:19.320 --> 2:20:24.680]  created another branch of government with these uh these judges great points jim thank you all right

[2:20:45.080 --> 2:20:50.840]  europe from africa to latin america was the most common form of government you had a ruling class
[2:20:50.840 --> 2:20:55.640]  the nobility the king and queen sitting on top of it and the rest of the public were kept at a
[2:20:55.640 --> 2:21:02.920]  assistance starving level for control in fact in most cultures they call the peasants the little
[2:21:02.920 --> 2:21:08.680]  people because they were usually a foot or more shorter than the lords and ladies because they
[2:21:08.680 --> 2:21:15.080]  kept them again at a starving level they were so busy trying to survive they would never try to
[2:21:15.080 --> 2:21:19.560]  challenge the entrenched elite well now all the big google owners and the rockefellers and the

[2:21:53.320 --> 2:22:01.400]  tyranny led by the w.a. show and the bill melinda gates foundation in full control many will submit
[2:22:01.400 --> 2:22:07.080]  through fear others will be bought off but in the end the globalists admit they're building a
[2:22:07.080 --> 2:22:14.280]  post-human world and now that we're inside the cage it's going to move very very quickly into
[2:22:14.280 --> 2:22:21.880]  its end game submission to this is a form of living death and committing the next generation
[2:22:21.880 --> 2:22:28.600]  and our own generation to a living hell that cannot be imagined until you're actually experiencing

[2:24:12.920 --> 2:24:18.200]  with us to talk about the whole general flinn paul manifold situation but robert barnes is here
[2:24:18.200 --> 2:24:22.440]  he's doing the specialty show we've been doing the last few months seven to nine p.m american
[2:24:22.440 --> 2:24:27.560]  countdown a lot of radio and tv stations are picking up and that is obviously there for everybody
[2:24:27.560 --> 2:24:34.760]  at info wars dot com port slash show and band dot video but these videos going back years ago
[2:24:34.760 --> 2:24:40.760]  of mainstream news saying there is no spying on the president even when it came out they were
[2:24:40.760 --> 2:24:45.560]  these are not aging well and now we have the unclassified office of the director of national
[2:24:45.560 --> 2:24:52.760]  intelligence came out two days ago or yesterday may 13th and it says right here that indeed
[2:24:52.760 --> 2:24:59.800]  joe biden and others uh were spying directly on candidate and then elected and then president
[2:24:59.800 --> 2:25:05.480]  trump and then they lied to congress comey and others said trump was not the subject even though
[2:25:05.480 --> 2:25:11.720]  james comey's right there this is from the fives of court this is the unmasking joseph our biden
[2:25:11.720 --> 2:25:17.560]  this is this makes breaking into the psychiatrist of the democrat candidate look tame in comparison
[2:25:17.560 --> 2:25:24.360]  this is this is lightning in a bottle what do you call this i mean it's it's nixon's plumbers on
[2:25:24.360 --> 2:25:28.680]  steroids i mean basically uh apparently richard nixon's only great mistake was not weaponizing
[2:25:28.680 --> 2:25:32.920]  the nsa rather than using rather than trying to outsource it to ordinary plumbers he wouldn't
[2:25:32.920 --> 2:25:36.440]  have needed to break in he could have just had the nsa spy on every conversation that took place
[2:25:37.160 --> 2:25:40.760]  frank church reformed the church but he knew it was so illegal he had to do it separately
[2:25:40.760 --> 2:25:45.000]  yeah exactly arrogance of doing it through the agency i know that's what's extraordinary about
[2:25:45.000 --> 2:25:51.480]  this uh for all of nixon's problems nixon never weaponized the government itself against his
[2:25:51.480 --> 2:25:56.600]  opponents the argument was that he tried to cover it up after the fact but he wasn't using the fbi
[2:25:56.600 --> 2:26:00.360]  to go after his political adversaries or the irs to go after his political adversaries because he
[2:26:00.360 --> 2:26:05.560]  knew that was too dangerous exactly he considered that to be something that may be happening in the
[2:26:05.560 --> 2:26:10.760]  regular course of events but not something any president so he had more respect against abuse
[2:26:10.760 --> 2:26:16.360]  of power than barack obama did obama clearly weaponized everything it's now clear what the
[2:26:16.360 --> 2:26:23.000]  combination of the odis uh odini's rev revelations were is that not only did you have this massive
[2:26:23.000 --> 2:26:28.520]  unmasked and that's just fine that's the only other way to put it uh the they promised what it
[2:26:28.520 --> 2:26:32.680]  means is they're illegally spying on everybody but oh we don't unmask so we're not surveilling you're
[2:26:32.680 --> 2:26:37.560]  being watched but we're not taking the blinders off exactly that was the whole pretext so pretext
[2:26:37.560 --> 2:26:41.480]  was don't worry about this we're not going to misuse and abuse this power this power went in
[2:26:41.480 --> 2:26:46.360]  because the church committee found the nsa and the cia and the fbi elicitly spying on the guys they
[2:26:46.360 --> 2:26:50.840]  were spying foreign conversations they were spying on american conversations and they created the
[2:26:50.840 --> 2:26:56.440]  the whole ford intelligence surveillance act visa to prevent that from happening and said okay we
[2:26:56.440 --> 2:27:01.160]  will never look at any americans conversation and if we are it will only be unintentional or
[2:27:01.160 --> 2:27:06.440]  incidental we will not be deliberately unmasking their identity which is the same thing as full
[2:27:06.440 --> 2:27:12.280]  blown spying on that person so so now they they targeted their political enemy they tried to infiltrate
[2:27:12.280 --> 2:27:18.920]  they ran these two big impeachment scams they've been caught a major crime oh it's uh an expansive
[2:27:18.920 --> 2:27:22.920]  crime because not only were they going through and spying on him and they were spying on him before
[2:27:22.920 --> 2:27:27.480]  he was even conversing with people they were spying on him the day after trump got elected
[2:27:27.480 --> 2:27:32.440]  people are unmasking his identification for a string of conversations and it's not just people
[2:27:32.440 --> 2:27:37.080]  at the nsa or the fbi who are doing it people the justice department oh they were treating uh
[2:27:37.080 --> 2:27:43.160]  trumps phone lines like a three dollar whore yes and it was yes wide open for business the and it
[2:27:43.160 --> 2:27:48.200]  was the entire nature of the structure in which they were doing it and then they misled people
[2:27:48.200 --> 2:27:53.000]  samantha power misled people joe biden misled people and of course susan rice who was the first
[2:27:53.000 --> 2:27:57.880]  one to get caught doing this she initially said she had no idea what this unmasking allegations
[2:27:57.880 --> 2:28:02.280]  were about turns out she was completely complicit of course all the way through but the reason why
[2:28:02.280 --> 2:28:08.200]  she wrote that cya email on january 20th that said hey by the way on january 5th barack obama
[2:28:08.200 --> 2:28:12.200]  held a special meeting in the oval office about general flinn and about what we were up to they
[2:28:12.200 --> 2:28:16.840]  all said hey they said that a year ago brennan said it clapper we were ordered by the president to
[2:28:16.840 --> 2:28:22.120]  do this so they they see why they ate back then and while the media denied they ever spied they
[2:28:22.120 --> 2:28:26.520]  admitted they did exactly and what they did is they try to come up with a pretext like for example
[2:28:26.520 --> 2:28:30.600]  it was a meeting where he brings everybody together and he says whatever you do do everything
[2:28:30.600 --> 2:28:35.320]  lawfully well if your goal is to do things lawfully you don't need the fbi director there you don't
[2:28:35.320 --> 2:28:38.760]  need the justice department there if you're saying i don't want anything else to come out obama told
[2:28:38.760 --> 2:28:43.640]  comey don't tell trump that's an well in that conversation which is even more criminal exactly
[2:28:43.640 --> 2:28:48.920]  what happened was he was telling him he he said his pretext for not disclosing information was hey
[2:28:48.920 --> 2:28:52.680]  by the way we're going to be basically trying to target this guy but don't worry you'll all be on
[2:28:52.680 --> 2:28:57.400]  the up and up but by the way because we're targeting him don't tell the trump administration critical
[2:28:57.400 --> 2:29:02.360]  intelligence keep all of this information from him and keep other information from him so he
[2:29:02.360 --> 2:29:06.760]  doesn't know what this full score is okay so folks folks know the cover-up failed it's come out now
[2:29:07.800 --> 2:29:12.200]  what where does it go next i mean what does trump need to do to press the attack well i mean it's
[2:29:12.200 --> 2:29:16.680]  clear he's going to have to because the counterattack was last week obama comes out and lets his
[2:29:16.680 --> 2:29:22.040]  conversation leak saying by the way we need to stop the general flin case from unraveling right
[2:29:22.040 --> 2:29:26.360]  in front of our eyes and then the judge is instantly by the way you told kit like two weeks
[2:29:26.360 --> 2:29:31.800]  ago for an article he wrote the you predicted the judge would do this contempt move exactly and what's
[2:29:31.800 --> 2:29:37.240]  happened is it's bifurcated so first obama leaks it then two days later an ex-judge writes a piece
[2:29:37.240 --> 2:29:43.240]  in the washington post saying hey by the way maybe you could appoint an independent counsel to
[2:29:43.240 --> 2:29:47.720]  look into other potential issues and miscarriage so now judges are making their own little because
[2:29:47.720 --> 2:29:52.840]  and guess who is the guy the ex-judge who wrote that washington post piece yesterday judge Sullivan
[2:29:52.840 --> 2:29:58.680]  appoints him for the precise role he campaigned for in the washington post this is extraordinary
[2:29:58.680 --> 2:30:03.800]  and to give people an idea even professor turley noted no one has ever seen a federal district
[2:30:03.800 --> 2:30:09.320]  court judge do this this is not a power grab complete power grab it's hey if you think you're
[2:30:09.320 --> 2:30:13.480]  going to get out of the situation you're not i'm going to find every pretext every well explain
[2:30:13.480 --> 2:30:19.240]  how that works in prosecutors drop under us law or under common law it's done how does the judge go
[2:30:19.240 --> 2:30:24.600]  no since when is the judge the prosecutor exactly supposedly the neutral arbiter well it gives you
[2:30:24.600 --> 2:30:29.160]  a frightening sense of what federal judges think so that judge who wrote the opinion that gave that's
[2:30:29.160 --> 2:30:33.800]  plan of the idea in Sullivan's head this is a coordinated campaign obama gets his conversation
[2:30:33.800 --> 2:30:38.120]  leaked we got to stop this two days later key obama allies ex-judges writing pieces in the
[2:30:38.120 --> 2:30:42.360]  washington post giving the roadmap that's Sullivan follows because a little secret
[2:30:42.360 --> 2:30:46.600]  Sullivan's not the brightest judge in the world and so the and then Sullivan follows that script
[2:30:46.600 --> 2:30:50.760]  to a t now in fact with the with the judge wrote in the washington post piece who's now been appointed
[2:30:50.760 --> 2:30:55.960]  as a meek eye independent prosecutor effectively by the federal district court judge Sullivan
[2:30:55.960 --> 2:31:01.880]  is oh you can uh a judge for but how do you even do that when the prosecutors drop it the it's an
[2:31:01.880 --> 2:31:07.800]  old theory which is that if it would be a miscarriage of justice to allow the case to be dismissed you
[2:31:07.800 --> 2:31:13.240]  can refuse to dismiss that but the dc circuit is clear that's only when the government is playing
[2:31:13.240 --> 2:31:18.040]  games and they're trying to re prosecute someone will not usually go to the appeal level oh yeah
[2:31:18.040 --> 2:31:22.200]  without that he has no authority to deny the government's request in this case the only time
[2:31:22.200 --> 2:31:26.840]  a judge can deny the request is if the prosecutor is actually trying to hurt the defendant by
[2:31:26.840 --> 2:31:30.520]  game playing the system and bringing new charges in lieu of the current sure because the judge can
[2:31:30.520 --> 2:31:34.520]  only do this if they caught the prosecutor being given a bag of cash the parking lot but that would
[2:31:34.520 --> 2:31:39.880]  still get bumped right to appeal yeah correct the the the executive branch has complete discretion
[2:31:39.880 --> 2:31:45.800]  so they cannot the dc circuit so this is the court trying to be the executive branch absolutely
[2:31:45.800 --> 2:31:50.760]  trying to usurp the executive branch's power and saying he's going to find it wherever he can
[2:31:50.760 --> 2:31:54.760]  that's why he's talking about inherent authority which i've always found sort of bogus inherent
[2:31:54.760 --> 2:31:59.080]  authority is something that's necessary authority for authority or specifically given federal courts
[2:31:59.080 --> 2:32:03.160]  otherwise do not have broad yeah you don't have an inherent authority unless you have the inherent
[2:32:03.160 --> 2:32:06.680]  authority exactly and in garnt saying i have an inherent authority to pretend to be president
[2:32:06.680 --> 2:32:11.000]  if i have a house i own i could order it demolish even though it's crazy it's my house but if i don't
[2:32:11.000 --> 2:32:15.400]  own the house it's my neighbor's house i can't go inherent authority i demolish your house exactly
[2:32:15.400 --> 2:32:19.720]  it's got to be incidental to the power that already exists but the yeah the most shocking i think
[2:32:19.720 --> 2:32:23.960]  judge Sullivan already knows he cannot deny the government's motion so is this just a political
[2:32:23.960 --> 2:32:29.240]  stunt it's no it's the second move it's the contempt move it's the the that that was always his car
[2:32:29.240 --> 2:32:34.200]  to play was to claim that hey you know what judge general Flynn previously pled so any attempt to
[2:32:34.200 --> 2:32:39.480]  reverse it i'm now going to call a contempt of court criminal contempt of court criminal perjury
[2:32:39.480 --> 2:32:43.880]  and i'm going to use my power and politicized judges want to go after someone but doesn't
[2:32:43.880 --> 2:32:48.520]  Flynn just argue that he was pressured and it was a misunderstanding it is but that becomes a
[2:32:48.520 --> 2:32:53.080]  jury defense in other words the the judge issues the charge against him and then he has to defend
[2:32:53.080 --> 2:32:57.080]  himself to the jury to say look and but and this is what's frightening about the answer is congress
[2:32:57.080 --> 2:33:01.320]  should impeach this judge i think that be given what the judge did yes and the reason is bigger
[2:33:01.320 --> 2:33:06.120]  and broader than general flinn the what the two things should happen one president trump should
[2:33:06.120 --> 2:33:10.600]  quit waiting for the justice system to do justice go ahead and pardon general exactly shown
[2:33:10.600 --> 2:33:15.800]  pardon roger stone pardon all of it this game is over the game is over and that part of it in
[2:33:15.800 --> 2:33:20.280]  reverse course and start going after the people who do bad yeah why doesn't trump just exercises
[2:33:20.280 --> 2:33:24.520]  power it's it's long overdue i think he's been told just to wait for the justice system to work
[2:33:24.520 --> 2:33:29.080]  that's going to take way way too long in this case we'll be back with robert barnes i'm alex

[2:36:09.880 --> 2:36:17.480]  giant dystopia but a lot of people are waking up and there is a major backlash taking place against

[2:36:22.760 --> 2:36:28.600]  backbone and start saying no to people who take this moral high ground and say shut your business

[2:40:20.520 --> 2:40:27.720]  political time we're in because judges have never acted like this um the democrats have never i mean
[2:40:27.720 --> 2:40:34.520]  they're just crazy and they just keep doubling down and never giving up and now they admit
[2:40:34.520 --> 2:40:41.400]  they're trying to blow up the economy uh to to to stop trump but the the polls are showing
[2:40:41.400 --> 2:40:46.040]  that it's actually having the opposite effect but i'm concerned what are they gonna do now
[2:40:46.040 --> 2:40:51.160]  steal nukes and set them off i mean they just putting what i'm saying is it's a dereliction
[2:40:51.160 --> 2:40:55.800]  of duty if we the people and the president and others just keep letting them escalate their
[2:40:55.800 --> 2:41:00.680]  temper tantrum uh no doubt i mean the way i equated it recently is is this they're acting
[2:41:00.680 --> 2:41:07.720]  like they're the atf at waco in 1993 that's the kind of mindset mentality a sort of power intoxicated
[2:41:07.720 --> 2:41:11.880]  group of people who do not believe there's any real meaningful restraint or restriction on
[2:41:11.880 --> 2:41:16.280]  their course of conduct because the more power i get the more concerned down on a misuse it
[2:41:17.000 --> 2:41:20.680]  because you've got a huge hammer you better watch out they get more power they go crazy
[2:41:20.680 --> 2:41:25.880]  exactly it's it's always had the reverse effect it's had the effect of it of increasing their
[2:41:25.880 --> 2:41:31.480]  desire for more power and to show off that power i mean the you know the atf started the waco the
[2:41:31.480 --> 2:41:34.760]  way they did then they finished it with with everybody burned out and a bunch of kids dead
[2:41:34.760 --> 2:41:39.480]  and what was their first objective to raise the atf flag over the compound so it's a certain
[2:41:39.480 --> 2:41:45.480]  mentality that's a diseased mentality an infectious mindset that puts people at risk
[2:41:45.480 --> 2:41:49.480]  on a daily basis yeah they weren't thinking about the pr effect or like let's just burn it down
[2:41:49.480 --> 2:41:55.160]  and piss on it and show the world we're boss we're the ones we're in charge we're in control it's
[2:41:55.160 --> 2:42:00.280]  people often who have a like they did a psychological study of nazis and they looked at their diaries
[2:42:00.280 --> 2:42:04.600]  from world war one and they found certain psychological commonalities in their language
[2:42:04.600 --> 2:42:10.440]  and in their internal note taking that reflected a deep inner insecurity that led to this need for
[2:42:10.440 --> 2:42:14.920]  this external power and you're seeing the same thing with a lot of these they lost the war exactly
[2:42:14.920 --> 2:42:20.280]  lost the war and there are people who go all the way going back where it felt so inadequate
[2:42:20.280 --> 2:42:25.800]  that they had a need for this armor of extreme behavior in order to feel confident in the world
[2:42:25.800 --> 2:42:29.960]  you're right i've read those writings they were obsessed with losing yeah they called it red nurses
[2:42:29.960 --> 2:42:35.400]  white nurses and it was this that uh they had certain unique obsessions that predicted you
[2:42:35.400 --> 2:42:39.160]  could if you just knew their diaries forecast which ones would become nazis and which ones would
[2:42:39.160 --> 2:42:43.320]  not just looking at the world war one soldier diaries the same dynamic is here is you have
[2:42:43.320 --> 2:42:49.240]  this psychological sense of inadequacy by these people who seek power but why don't they ever
[2:42:49.240 --> 2:42:53.720]  when they get their ass they keep losing losing losing but they keep doubling down because they
[2:42:53.720 --> 2:42:58.120]  need the power to survive i think at a core psychological level and so when their power
[2:42:58.120 --> 2:43:02.520]  is threatened is when they go more and more crazy because if they're acting reasonable if they're
[2:43:02.520 --> 2:43:07.000]  acting rational they would recognize it's not in their own interest to expose the system the way
[2:43:07.000 --> 2:43:13.960]  they are let's move past them they're they're they're bill bar is starting to impress me he's
[2:43:13.960 --> 2:43:19.960]  doing more and more good yes uh trump though at a certain point if i'm letting a pit bull
[2:43:19.960 --> 2:43:24.840]  run around and bite kids in my backyard at a certain point it's my fault exactly so they have to stop
[2:43:24.840 --> 2:43:29.480]  them correct he's got to take action so i mean i guess today there was talk where he did an
[2:43:29.480 --> 2:43:34.600]  interviewer instead of using his power to shut down these illicit investigations people are
[2:43:34.600 --> 2:43:40.040]  pitching him the idea of using the military to go out and do vaccines next year so this is not
[2:43:40.040 --> 2:43:45.720]  that's not a good idea he needs to start exercising his own power ignore like oh you'll be powerful
[2:43:45.720 --> 2:43:49.560]  if you make people take shots will be nice to you exactly he's got to ignore all of that they've
[2:43:49.560 --> 2:43:53.880]  already given him tons of bad advice they told him to play out the molar thing and all all that did
[2:43:53.880 --> 2:43:58.600]  was lead to unnecessary harassment investigation and bogus prosecution that's what i'm saying is they
[2:43:58.600 --> 2:44:04.680]  keep escalating the hoaxes until i'm wondering if we survive covet nineteen what's the new
[2:44:04.680 --> 2:44:08.120]  what's the new thing they're gonna pull i mean they're gonna keep trying everything they can
[2:44:09.000 --> 2:44:12.280]  even if it fails they'll try something else that's clear that's why the president has to
[2:44:12.280 --> 2:44:17.800]  start to push back playing nice playing ball has not worked at all it's time for him to instead
[2:44:17.800 --> 2:44:22.360]  start to assert the presidential power he inherently has i'm not a peniche guy i don't want
[2:44:22.360 --> 2:44:26.200]  to let us get helicopter rides but they're trying to give us helicopter rides oh no that about a
[2:44:26.200 --> 2:44:30.760]  certain point i'm like well the power of the pardon is an is an incredible power to totally
[2:44:30.760 --> 2:44:34.040]  re-script justice and why is he intimidated by that he needs to i think people told him all
[2:44:34.040 --> 2:44:38.440]  that you'll be perceived as being political if you do it enough's enough all of these cases are
[2:44:38.440 --> 2:44:43.320]  political these are absurd actions when you have left-leaning professors like jonathan turley say
[2:44:43.320 --> 2:44:48.360]  he's never seen anything like this in his life and only that it threatens to uh to cover up
[2:44:48.360 --> 2:44:53.000]  prosecutorial misconduct and police abuse all across the country because most of people who
[2:44:53.000 --> 2:44:57.080]  raise that are people who have been criminally accused many of them have pled and by the way
[2:44:57.080 --> 2:45:01.320]  i'm not in some exercise defending the police in every aspect or like the general public they
[2:45:01.320 --> 2:45:05.800]  have problems the police are the ones that don't like this plan to go grab people's kids and do
[2:45:05.800 --> 2:45:09.640]  force circulation well look what happens that's a damn suicide mission exactly what happened
[2:45:09.640 --> 2:45:13.720]  to the seattle cop the seattle cop went forward said hey my boss said we're gonna apply the
[2:45:13.720 --> 2:45:17.320]  constitution that's our only oath not to the governor now he's been put on an administrative
[2:45:17.320 --> 2:45:20.920]  leave and they're threatening termination to him just because he said he was going to uphold the
[2:45:20.920 --> 2:45:25.080]  constitution so the public should rally behind him and make him mayor oh yes of course no exactly
[2:45:25.080 --> 2:45:30.120]  and there needs to be more uh public rallying in order to show the president the right path
[2:45:30.120 --> 2:45:35.480]  the this is an extraordinary abuse of power by judge solovan this is a dangerous precarious
[2:45:35.480 --> 2:45:40.200]  misuse and abuse of power that threatens uh the rights of people let me hear your prediction
[2:45:40.200 --> 2:45:45.320]  because everything they do fails but they keep attacking what's the next escalation i don't i
[2:45:45.320 --> 2:45:50.920]  don't i mean uh so many of these things are completely uh unprecedented and parallel but
[2:45:50.920 --> 2:45:56.680]  my guess is you're gonna start to see more judges try to unilaterally claim power they don't have
[2:45:56.680 --> 2:46:01.400]  aside from prosecutors and random offices trying to target trump associates and affiliates for
[2:46:01.400 --> 2:46:05.640]  whatever other reason they can come up with you're gonna see judges if he lets judge solve and get
[2:46:05.640 --> 2:46:10.280]  away with this other judges are gonna say hey i'm just gonna claim inherent power to investigate
[2:46:10.280 --> 2:46:14.920]  over here look at this person over there attack this person here that's the problem that's the
[2:46:14.920 --> 2:46:20.040]  risk and that's why he has to push back now that's why he has to draw the line now and say
[2:46:20.040 --> 2:46:25.000]  pass this line go no further in order to protect the rights of all of them but it is like a bad
[2:46:25.000 --> 2:46:29.240]  teenager throwing a fit yes yes there's definitely and how do you handle that you send them to their
[2:46:29.240 --> 2:46:33.240]  room you don't say well let's see how this works out you don't say hey let's see what happens over
[2:46:33.240 --> 2:46:37.320]  the next hour you say i'm taking the car keys yeah exactly you've got to be able to remove
[2:46:37.320 --> 2:46:42.440]  that person's power to continue to cause harm and send a public message and if republicans have any
[2:46:42.440 --> 2:46:46.600]  guts at all they need to do two things one look at impeaching some of these rogue judges
[2:46:46.600 --> 2:46:49.560]  but also i mean if it was good enough for the president it's good enough for judges well
[2:46:49.560 --> 2:46:54.520]  by the way it's beyond guts they'd have to have raw guts not to fight this they better they better
[2:46:54.520 --> 2:47:00.520]  go on the offense to show the out of control deep state that we're not gonna be appeasing this or
[2:47:00.520 --> 2:47:04.920]  trying to hide out and hope you don't get hit let me just tell republican leader something i know
[2:47:04.920 --> 2:47:09.080]  most of you are smart a lot of you aren't being attacked by the new world order is a good thing
[2:47:09.080 --> 2:47:13.080]  you need to stop worrying about being attacked you want to be attacked
[2:47:13.880 --> 2:47:19.400]  oh absolutely and in fact you need to welcome it invite it and then counterattack as as necessary
[2:47:19.400 --> 2:47:23.400]  and but what's happening is people are simply not asserting the power that they have people in the
[2:47:23.400 --> 2:47:27.000]  senate are not asserting the power they have the president hasn't asserted the power that he has
[2:47:27.000 --> 2:47:31.400]  it's good to see attorney general bar start to assert power but this was an obvious case this was
[2:47:31.400 --> 2:47:35.880]  an obvious instance of abuse the flin prosecution it needs to go further and that's why the president
[2:47:35.880 --> 2:47:40.680]  could send a message by not only pardoning general flin but use it as an opportunity to pardon roger
[2:47:40.680 --> 2:47:44.600]  stone who's on the clock to go to prison within days or weeks well i'll say this and when we've
[2:47:44.600 --> 2:47:47.800]  got another lawyer popping and he'll be with us then the other host takes over jason jones
[2:47:51.560 --> 2:47:58.040]  this whole thing is insane and it just gets weirder and crazier and the democrats think
[2:47:58.040 --> 2:48:04.360]  they're gonna shut the economy down and blame trump no one is buying this so but i don't say
[2:48:04.360 --> 2:48:08.520]  that in a confidence way it's actually scary that they're so stupid and they think they're
[2:48:08.520 --> 2:48:15.160]  going to get away with this i mean this is crazy town ladies and gentlemen and it's what
[2:48:15.160 --> 2:48:20.360]  americans being asleep has allowed to grow at the universities and the media because these people
[2:48:20.360 --> 2:48:24.680]  are in their own bubble and they have no idea what's really going on we'll be right back with
[2:48:24.680 --> 2:48:35.800]  hour number four stay with us and spread those lines this is the end my friends my only friends the
[2:48:35.800 --> 2:48:44.280]  end of our elaborate plans the end of everything that stands the end the safety the delusion
[2:48:45.080 --> 2:48:52.520]  it's all over ladies and gentlemen because there was only the mirage of safety movies and partying
[2:48:52.520 --> 2:48:58.760]  and living like children never growing up never caring about other people this delivered us into
[2:48:58.760 --> 2:49:04.440]  the hands of tyranny just like the history books show us just like the bible states every time isreal
[2:49:04.440 --> 2:49:10.120]  became corrupt and evil and turned away from god they were brought into captivity because their
[2:49:10.120 --> 2:49:15.880]  people sold out to special interests that were infiltrated by spies and then they were enslaved
[2:49:15.880 --> 2:49:23.160]  we are repeating that again today compliance and going along with this system leads to absolute
[2:49:23.160 --> 2:49:29.240]  bondage info wars has decided to fight for freedom info wars has had great victory thanks to your
[2:49:29.240 --> 2:49:37.560]  support and your prayers info wars has become a symbol an emblem of not just american freedom
[2:49:37.560 --> 2:49:44.040]  but worldwide maverick spirit it's not just myself or the host at info wars or the researchers
[2:49:44.040 --> 2:49:49.240]  or the journalists it's you the listeners the activists the people on the front lines in the
[2:49:49.240 --> 2:49:55.560]  arena and it's the amazing guests and individuals that we interview that make info wars so special
[2:49:55.560 --> 2:50:00.760]  because we're not putting a filter in front of free minds we're having an open discussion about
[2:50:00.760 --> 2:50:05.640]  the real state of the world not the establishment of talking points that are put out by the council
[2:50:05.640 --> 2:50:10.840]  in front of relations to build a burden group the debuts group and other clubs we're pushing
[2:50:10.840 --> 2:50:18.120]  for a pro human future where we build a planet and beyond based on humans or humans by humans
[2:50:18.120 --> 2:50:23.320]  not a world where the establishment hate themselves project their hate onto us and decide
[2:50:23.320 --> 2:50:28.440]  we're gonna have a post human world i'm really excited to know that info wars has your support
[2:50:28.440 --> 2:50:31.560]  i want to thank you all for being pro human and pro god
[2:50:31.560 --> 2:50:37.960]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[2:50:37.960 --> 2:50:50.360]  so
[2:50:59.800 --> 2:51:01.880]  i never claimed to be a rocket scientist
[2:51:01.880 --> 2:51:07.960]  welcome back here to the alex jones show with robert barnes and roger stone's personal
[2:51:07.960 --> 2:51:14.680]  lawyer fowler nixon but i do know how to read political tea leaves and the power grab by the
[2:51:14.680 --> 2:51:20.600]  leftist in the deep state and the chi-com operators and their desperateness is is it's only gonna
[2:51:20.600 --> 2:51:27.480]  backfire in the short term who knows what habit they can wreak but i'm not lionizing bill bar i
[2:51:27.480 --> 2:51:33.080]  think he understands that we have a real anti-american system here that threatens all the institutions
[2:51:33.080 --> 2:51:40.040]  good bad and and and and ugly and that if they don't turn this back now the whole system loses
[2:51:40.040 --> 2:51:44.760]  credibility so it's kind of that moment of truth tyler nixon watching this with roger's
[2:51:44.760 --> 2:51:50.680]  post report to jail manifold ordered release another political president general flin the judge
[2:51:50.680 --> 2:51:58.120]  uh i'm being an executive tyrant threatening all of this in law as a constitutional lawyer
[2:51:58.120 --> 2:52:03.480]  what is your approximation of what's happening oh it's it's it's absolutely unprecedented i was
[2:52:03.480 --> 2:52:10.120]  just shocked at uh jud solovon's axon as i mean this is impeachable material in my opinion uh it
[2:52:10.120 --> 2:52:17.000]  resembles frankly what amy berman jackson uh did in many ways in roger's case um i gotta tell you
[2:52:17.000 --> 2:52:24.600]  what the dc it reflects the level the depth of the swamp in washington that our federal judiciary
[2:52:24.600 --> 2:52:33.480]  has reached this low uh in the dc district court or is it or is it desperation you know it's funny
[2:52:33.480 --> 2:52:38.920]  you say that i literally wrote on my pad here desperation i think it is desperation i think
[2:52:38.920 --> 2:52:44.200]  the jig is up i think they've run run this hoax on the american public for four years as long as
[2:52:44.200 --> 2:52:48.760]  they could and they've run out of they've run out of the ability to no i agree with you i think it's
[2:52:48.760 --> 2:52:54.200]  desperation so tell us the flavor and the smell of the desperation why are they desperate well
[2:52:54.200 --> 2:53:00.120]  because they're they're lord high emperor and uh boy king obama is at the center of it all and
[2:53:00.120 --> 2:53:04.920]  always has been he's always been and what a weird cult around him and hillary like they literally
[2:53:04.920 --> 2:53:10.760]  think they they give godlike powers to these people no and and the the psychophantic uh
[2:53:10.760 --> 2:53:16.120]  uh you know just the quality of people around them is just it's chilling and it literally is
[2:53:16.120 --> 2:53:20.680]  like a cult that you know and even this judge sullivan i don't know what you know it seems to
[2:53:20.680 --> 2:53:27.880]  me he is just desperate uh to to frame to to see general flinn go down the river um and i think
[2:53:27.880 --> 2:53:32.440]  ultimately it is because it they want these convictions they want it to criminalize they
[2:53:32.440 --> 2:53:36.840]  want the ability to criminalize as they did with roger stone anybody who's opposed them and particularly
[2:53:36.840 --> 2:53:41.960]  their the the key allies the key people you'll note that uh general flinn was fired by obama and
[2:53:41.960 --> 2:53:48.520]  became a heavy critic of the administration i guess around 2015 or so uh and i think even obama had
[2:53:48.520 --> 2:53:53.560]  told or try to tell trump or try to tell someone keep your eye on this guy i guess within his
[2:53:53.560 --> 2:53:59.080]  administration uh so they kept tabs on flinn and then when he uh became a key ally and a key
[2:53:59.080 --> 2:54:03.880]  supporter of president trump while trump was a candidate i think that really sent shockwaves
[2:54:03.880 --> 2:54:08.280]  through uh obama's people and they realized that they're in trouble because you know oh yeah listen
[2:54:08.280 --> 2:54:14.120]  to that table obama last week that's the first time he sounds scared uh barns oh i mean yes well
[2:54:14.120 --> 2:54:19.400]  the that's evident by the mere fact that he's even talking about this period he's an expressin
[2:54:19.400 --> 2:54:23.480]  he there's there's no reason for him to be talking about there used to be a protocol not to mention
[2:54:23.480 --> 2:54:29.320]  anything that happens in your successor for at least one term or if not two terms but there's
[2:54:29.320 --> 2:54:33.720]  no reason for him to be talking about the flinn case at all so for the fact that none of these
[2:54:33.720 --> 2:54:38.120]  talking about it but having people leak his conversations concerning it and having a tape
[2:54:38.120 --> 2:54:43.400]  recorded and in order for that that was meant to have the judges attack he's like exactly the goal
[2:54:43.400 --> 2:54:48.440]  was to let everybody know obama considers this so bad that everybody needs to exercise whatever
[2:54:48.440 --> 2:54:53.000]  power they have that's why comey sent the tweet saying just keep fighting yes exactly comey did
[2:54:53.000 --> 2:54:57.800]  it but it's like it's like the germans when the russians had turned the tide i mean they're gonna
[2:54:57.800 --> 2:55:02.680]  lose the question is how bad is it gonna get yeah the the end game it doesn't appear they appear to
[2:55:02.680 --> 2:55:06.680]  be like low level criminals who are one step thinkers not two step thinkers that's the reason
[2:55:06.680 --> 2:55:10.280]  why they end up caught i mean the people that are caught criminals have low IQ tests for that
[2:55:10.280 --> 2:55:14.040]  reason they're the ones who got caught for a reason uh it's the same logic they appear to be
[2:55:14.040 --> 2:55:18.280]  thinking how do we just stop the general flinn case from unraveling in front of our eyes not how
[2:55:18.280 --> 2:55:23.960]  do our actions expose what we're doing even worse uh than if we had done nothing at all so i think
[2:55:23.960 --> 2:55:28.440]  they're they're missing the broader picture in this in the larger strategic perspective they're
[2:55:28.440 --> 2:55:33.560]  they're exposing to the world who they are them they not only did they unmask flinn they unmask
[2:55:33.560 --> 2:55:37.400]  themselves in the way that they are based well exactly we'll be right back in 60 seconds with
[2:55:37.400 --> 2:55:45.160]  tyler next let's stay with us as i record this announcement there's only one week left in the

[2:56:37.720 --> 2:56:50.120]  at infowarstore.com waging war on corruption it's alex jones coming to you live from the front lines
[2:56:50.120 --> 2:57:04.040]  of the info war tyler nixon one of roger stone's personal lawyers good friend of his here with us
[2:57:04.040 --> 2:57:11.400]  responding to flin and the judge saying i don't care the justice department drops charges i'm
[2:57:11.400 --> 2:57:16.520]  going to continue on so to both of you're both lawyers both prominent lawyers i'm not a lawyer
[2:57:16.520 --> 2:57:21.160]  but i thought judges weren't prosecutors but they were supposedly these neutral arbiters
[2:57:21.880 --> 2:57:29.080]  what the hell's going on here tyler nixon oh i mean it's i can't it's so unprecedented i'm almost
[2:57:29.080 --> 2:57:34.360]  uh speechless in terms of responding you know in any rational way with regard to the law i know
[2:57:34.360 --> 2:57:40.040]  that under rule 42 criminal contempt proceedings uh there there are two types of trials or two types
[2:57:40.040 --> 2:57:45.960]  of uh ways you can bring a criminal content one is bring a new criminal case the damn government
[2:57:45.960 --> 2:57:50.760]  just dropped the case how does the judge invent the case the only thing well i think that's like
[2:57:50.760 --> 2:57:55.080]  an inquisitive like far go ahead robert put his he put his finger on he's going to use contempt
[2:57:55.080 --> 2:58:01.480]  he's going to use the ability of him because because flin's uh guilty plea was in his presence so
[2:58:01.480 --> 2:58:04.680]  if it was if there was contempt that occurred out of his presence he would have to appoint a
[2:58:04.680 --> 2:58:10.920]  prosecutor uh and it would have to be a jury trial but that was a forced contempt a forced
[2:58:11.880 --> 2:58:15.640]  thing to arrest his son so it was done to do rest so the crime is by the state
[2:58:16.440 --> 2:58:19.720]  yeah well unfortunately why would the judge bring that out in front of a damn jury
[2:58:19.720 --> 2:58:25.640]  the wheels go ahead robert well just the whole nature of it in terms of what the judge is doing
[2:58:25.640 --> 2:58:29.800]  is extraordinary i mean contempt is supposed to be when you need control of your courtroom
[2:58:29.800 --> 2:58:33.800]  somebody's going crazy somebody's doing what bobby seal did in the 1960s sure it's not the whole
[2:58:33.800 --> 2:58:38.200]  prosecutional point yeah exactly it's not doing these it's not intended for that separate role
[2:58:38.200 --> 2:58:42.520]  in fact congress changed the statute to require jury trials even in cases of criminal contempt
[2:58:42.520 --> 2:58:46.920]  in federal court even if this sentence is six months or less because they were worried about
[2:58:46.920 --> 2:58:54.280]  judges abusing this power yeah yeah and i mean i think you have uh you know this this this entire
[2:58:54.280 --> 2:58:58.600]  thing the corruption that has been exposed and you said it before we went to the break alex you
[2:58:58.600 --> 2:59:03.240]  know they're exposing there are perhaps you did bob they're exposing themselves in this process
[2:59:03.240 --> 2:59:07.320]  because they're so desperate to cover it up they cannot i mean they've gotten sort of ahead of their
[2:59:07.320 --> 2:59:12.200]  skis they can't think how this looks they're trying to keep the thing together but it's you
[2:59:12.200 --> 2:59:17.160]  know big giant pieces chunks of it are falling off and exposing what went on and it's going right
[2:59:17.160 --> 2:59:21.160]  to double down to do something even more tyrannical exactly i mean they're exposing the system at an
[2:59:21.160 --> 2:59:25.720]  unbelievable level go ahead sorry yeah which i know absolutely which in a sense i think is
[2:59:26.280 --> 2:59:31.320]  as agonizing as has been certainly for roger stone certainly for general flinn i would hope if
[2:59:31.320 --> 2:59:37.400]  president trump who needs to act now he needs to move quickly uh and he needs to uh empower bar
[2:59:37.400 --> 2:59:41.160]  whatever is necessary first of all again the pardons need to be issued general flinn roger
[2:59:41.160 --> 2:59:45.160]  stone immediately and frankly paul maniforte and anybody else has been sucked up into this
[2:59:45.160 --> 2:59:49.320]  who i'm glad to see he was finally released from custody or at least a home confinement
[2:59:49.960 --> 2:59:57.000]  and and let's let's get on with it i mean if this is permitted to stand if durham bar and these guys
[2:59:57.000 --> 3:00:02.200]  give a pass to what we've already seen just in terms of the unmasking alone if they let these
[3:00:02.200 --> 3:00:06.840]  people get away with this i i really fear for the future of the republic i mean because this is a
[3:00:06.840 --> 3:00:11.640]  fundamental level they've been caught in a coup oh yeah yeah absolutely you're seeing the degree
[3:00:11.640 --> 3:00:15.480]  to it's the next time anybody tells you that judges don't pay attention to the court of public
[3:00:15.480 --> 3:00:20.760]  opinion in the press just point to this case because that was revealed when solovan reacted when
[3:00:20.760 --> 3:00:24.920]  soloman did it what he did at the first flinn sentencing hearing where he accused him falsely
[3:00:24.920 --> 3:00:28.920]  of treason which was an insane allegation then came back right after the break and said he
[3:00:28.920 --> 3:00:33.000]  misspoke i was pointing out to people how did he know that that had become controversial within
[3:00:33.000 --> 3:00:38.280]  the lunch break unless he was monitoring in live time social media commentary about well he tells
[3:00:38.280 --> 3:00:43.880]  how dumb the judges yeah the judge is not but uh judge solovan is not known so like you're a russian
[3:00:43.880 --> 3:00:49.000]  spy he wasn't even charged with russia exactly it's and i would note the same thing happened in
[3:00:49.000 --> 3:00:55.240]  the uh stone case amy berman jackson was clearly reading media reports she was uh making comments
[3:00:55.240 --> 3:00:58.760]  throughout the trial and throughout the proceedings before the trial as well that that
[3:00:58.760 --> 3:01:03.640]  indicated that she was reading you know left-wing media reports and buying into this whole notion
[3:01:03.640 --> 3:01:07.880]  of roger stone is the villain roger stone is already guilty let's just get this over with
[3:01:07.880 --> 3:01:14.600]  roger stone's evil uh you know all the way down to this uh this bogus um uh what they use the cross
[3:01:14.600 --> 3:01:19.480]  hair issue whatever on the photo that was uh that the prosecutor admitted by the way one of the
[3:01:19.480 --> 3:01:23.880]  prosecutors admitted that the government knew was not an attempt to threaten the judge or was not in
[3:01:23.880 --> 3:01:29.640]  any way attempt to intimidate the court but was simply just the logo of the uh the organization
[3:01:29.640 --> 3:01:33.960]  that roger had barred the photo from to use in his instagram post yet the judge used that to
[3:01:33.960 --> 3:01:38.600]  completely and unconstitutionally silence a defendant in the midst of a criminal uh proceeding
[3:01:38.600 --> 3:01:44.360]  and then went on further which is the most outrageous of all uh to basically in motions in limine
[3:01:45.160 --> 3:01:50.360]  deny roger the ability or his defense team the ability to even raise the possibility of any
[3:01:50.360 --> 3:01:54.840]  corruption within the prosecution the molar team conflicts of interest any that was excluded at the
[3:01:54.840 --> 3:02:00.520]  outset to me that is the time we have left gentlemen this is not going well for them so
[3:02:01.160 --> 3:02:06.120]  how does congress impeach these people are what does trump do he he needs to just exercise the
[3:02:06.120 --> 3:02:11.400]  power and say i try to let the courts do it your political horrors pardoned why is he scared of that
[3:02:12.040 --> 3:02:15.800]  because he's been told that if the same reason he's told to go along with the lockdowns hey if you
[3:02:15.800 --> 3:02:19.400]  don't do it millions of people are gonna die and that's gonna be on you the pardon pitch is oh if
[3:02:19.400 --> 3:02:22.760]  you pardon anybody they're going to say it's corruption because look at what happened last
[3:02:22.760 --> 3:02:27.320]  time when he fires james comey he gets subject to years of investigation so that's the same pitch
[3:02:27.320 --> 3:02:31.320]  the same pit with the lesson he should have learned was letting go of general flinn was the
[3:02:31.320 --> 3:02:35.880]  mistake that was where the mistake started letting go joke comey was not the mistake that never would
[3:02:35.880 --> 3:02:39.880]  have blown up had he not let go of general flinn earlier now he needs to learn the same lesson
[3:02:39.880 --> 3:02:43.160]  everybody around him is giving him bad advice they're worried about these are bureaucrats that
[3:02:43.160 --> 3:02:46.440]  are in control of the government exactly and they just don't want trump bringing a new crew in
[3:02:46.440 --> 3:02:50.120]  exactly as long as he tells the american people on the speech that they're done exactly just go out
[3:02:50.120 --> 3:02:54.200]  and say this is nonsense this is absurd even liberal law professors are saying they've never
[3:02:54.200 --> 3:02:58.440]  seen this happen to make sure we protect the integrity of the justice system which is what
[3:02:58.440 --> 3:03:01.800]  this judge is doing he's not just threatening that in the general flinn case he's threatening
[3:03:02.440 --> 3:03:06.040]  anyone from coming forward with government i'll tell you why they're doing it they've never been
[3:03:06.040 --> 3:03:12.760]  punished so why shouldn't they try that's exactly right notice who also was the one who sold seal
[3:03:12.760 --> 3:03:17.400]  general flinn's fate within the administration vice president pence that tells you a lot about
[3:03:17.400 --> 3:03:21.400]  where he says he's willing to welcome him back but you know thanks for nothing mr vice president i
[3:03:21.400 --> 3:03:25.800]  think you know he needs to be looked at with a wary eye i would like to real quick before you know
[3:03:25.800 --> 3:03:32.040]  rock bob your show is amazing i i commend it to everybody and congratulations and alex is a coup
[3:03:32.040 --> 3:03:36.840]  having uh this this amazing counselor and constitutionalists uh in the info wars fold
[3:03:36.840 --> 3:03:41.320]  and it's must watch every night i mean i literally have to uh what was your point go ahead
[3:03:41.320 --> 3:03:47.080]  oh i mean i just think that uh you know this this could be in the end of something good
[3:03:47.080 --> 3:03:51.160]  in exposing all this and maybe we can finally sweep it away but if it does and it is allowed
[3:03:51.160 --> 3:03:56.520]  to stand it will be a uh cancer that's been building up since the clintons were uh came to
[3:03:56.520 --> 3:04:01.960]  washington dc that will literally destroy our our justice system rule of law and fray this
[3:04:01.960 --> 3:04:05.960]  constitutional republic to such an extent i don't know if we can survive just let me ask you this
[3:04:05.960 --> 3:04:10.520]  tyler nexon how's roger doing and yeah we hear any day he could be sent to prison they're letting
[3:04:10.520 --> 3:04:15.240]  child molesters out but he's got to go to prison yeah i spoke to roger this morning uh he sounded
[3:04:15.240 --> 3:04:19.960]  better than ever i think he's got his chops back he you know the gag order being lifted uh he knows
[3:04:19.960 --> 3:04:25.000]  he can really fight now and he can he can push back and i think he's got amazing appeal grounds i mean
[3:04:25.000 --> 3:04:29.960]  i think this judge was totally out of control in his case was an autocratic uh just you know it was
[3:04:29.960 --> 3:04:36.520]  intent on on absolutely railroading roger and had prejudged the case um and moreover i think we're
[3:04:36.520 --> 3:04:40.280]  pretty confident and the president is going to do the right thing i just don't know what he's waiting
[3:04:40.280 --> 3:04:47.960]  on how many days away is roger from going to prison well okay what they've given him is a 30-day
[3:04:47.960 --> 3:04:53.320]  reprieve at which time they will revisit the issue so we're coming up i guess about maybe 10 days to
[3:04:53.320 --> 3:04:57.240]  two weeks i can't imagine i think it's going to be one of these every 30 days they decide not to
[3:04:57.240 --> 3:05:02.040]  take him in i cannot see if the releasing palm manifold that roger would ever see a day behind
[3:05:02.040 --> 3:05:07.960]  bars uh unless they decide to initiate some sort of home confinement situation but you never know
[3:05:07.960 --> 3:05:12.440]  i mean the deep states uh tentacles run deep they might uh they might just want to have him perp
[3:05:12.440 --> 3:05:17.240]  walked and see whatever the case the president should never let i mean if if they move to take
[3:05:17.240 --> 3:05:21.720]  roger into custody in any way that's when he needs to pardon him he cannot see him day behind bars
[3:05:21.720 --> 3:05:28.840]  nixon how do folks follow you on twitter at tyler p nixon all right and barns you're at barns law

[3:05:49.560 --> 3:05:55.080]  the uh our justice system has been unmasked in the same way that general flin was unmasked
[3:05:55.080 --> 3:06:00.120]  in an order for the president to take meaningful action what we need is not mass mandatory mass
[3:06:00.120 --> 3:06:04.840]  for people around the world just to go out and enjoy their lives what we need is the unmasking
[3:06:04.840 --> 3:06:09.240]  of the criminal justice process that has been so corrupted that the presidential pardon is needed
[3:06:09.240 --> 3:06:13.720]  now more than ever it's why the founders put it there it's time for the president to remind people
[3:06:13.720 --> 3:06:19.160]  that he's the president nobody else that's right we need the mass to come off not the master no one
[3:06:19.160 --> 3:06:24.600]  exactly we need the unmasking of the criminality that's taken place within the justice department
[3:06:24.600 --> 3:06:31.320]  in order to free up the rest of civil society in our civil justice system to purge the illicit
[3:06:31.320 --> 3:06:36.120]  activities that the deep state has well one thing's for sure things aren't boring jason jones takes over

[3:08:45.880 --> 3:09:04.760]  hello hot people of the planet earth this is jason jones filling in on hour four
[3:09:05.240 --> 3:09:11.400]  for the one the only alex jones and we are running against the wind you know i'm a filmmaker and
[3:09:11.400 --> 3:09:17.960]  when you you make a film you write a script all movies they have one word that sums up the film
[3:09:17.960 --> 3:09:22.840]  the theme of every film you've ever watched is one word and so i thought when i'm doing this
[3:09:22.840 --> 3:09:28.600]  show i need to i need to boil each episode down the privilege of guest hosting a show
[3:09:28.600 --> 3:09:35.480]  down to one word and the one word for today's show is unity there's a cliche you can't
[3:09:35.480 --> 3:09:43.480]  uh lead a horse to water but you can salt the oats and our oats america are being salted
[3:09:43.480 --> 3:09:49.320]  for division they can't divide us but they consult the oats and they are doing it in every way
[3:09:49.880 --> 3:09:55.400]  and another another cliche a buddy of mine said to me uh i said to a buddy of mine i'm
[3:09:55.400 --> 3:09:59.560]  i can nervous doing the alex jones show i don't get nervous doing my own show i said but this is
[3:09:59.560 --> 3:10:04.600]  like a buddy gives you the keys to his Ferrari and says go for a ride this is a valuable this is
[3:10:04.600 --> 3:10:10.520]  a valuable airtime he said well ferrari's are meant to be driven fast just drive fast and i
[3:10:10.520 --> 3:10:17.800]  thought okay well i want to drive fast today for you so i brought on two guests there are people
[3:10:17.800 --> 3:10:23.880]  i admire i've been looking up to for years uh kevin and keith hodge the hodge twins the conservative
[3:10:23.880 --> 3:10:32.440]  twins uh do we got you guys on the air oh yeah yeah thanks for having us well hey guys i met you
[3:10:32.440 --> 3:10:38.840]  at a rap party i was shooting a film in washington dc i was in the trump hotel eating dates wrapped
[3:10:38.840 --> 3:10:48.440]  with bacon did you guys try the dates by the way never cry dad i love bacon though so i'm sitting
[3:10:48.440 --> 3:10:54.120]  there eating a date wrapped with bacon how the world has changed in the trump hotel in washington dc
[3:10:55.000 --> 3:11:00.360]  and there i see my hero one of my heroes and then i see both my heroes i have been following you guys
[3:11:00.360 --> 3:11:08.200]  since uh you were making weightlifting videos and uh you're just two courageous guys and as soon as this
[3:11:08.200 --> 3:11:14.760]  i met aubrey's story broke i wanted to hear what you had to say about it and you said you were going
[3:11:14.760 --> 3:11:20.760]  to offend everybody uh and maybe you did but they had to be pretty small soul i thought what you
[3:11:20.760 --> 3:11:28.680]  said made a lot of sense um i see this story as being our oats as americans are being salted to
[3:11:28.680 --> 3:11:37.240]  create division yep definitely definitely yeah i'm from the moment this um story broke um they
[3:11:37.240 --> 3:11:41.880]  said amald aubrey was a a jogger just shot running through a neighborhood i was like
[3:11:41.880 --> 3:11:46.280]  common sense told me from initially when i heard that i said that doesn't sound right nobody just
[3:11:46.280 --> 3:11:50.920]  gets gunned down jogging through that neighborhood it's always more to the story especially when
[3:11:50.920 --> 3:11:55.320]  you are looking at anything posted by the media yeah you got to double check everything they say
[3:11:55.320 --> 3:12:01.320]  because yeah every side has their the story that they want to paint so i knew there was more to it
[3:12:01.320 --> 3:12:07.720]  than that yeah and everybody's gotten a general media they've forgotten what the whole role is
[3:12:07.720 --> 3:12:11.880]  is to tell the facts about the case and you're supposed to take from what they say and make
[3:12:11.880 --> 3:12:16.840]  your own determination now the media whenever they report any story they have an agenda they
[3:12:16.840 --> 3:12:22.680]  want to manipulate how they want you to think yeah they frame it they frame it to meet their agenda
[3:12:22.680 --> 3:12:34.520]  yeah all right go ahead oh okay so um from the video when i first started researching
[3:12:34.520 --> 3:12:39.000]  up this story i said you know i'm just going to be objective i'm not going to play this race game
[3:12:39.000 --> 3:12:43.560]  i'm not going to take a march side i'm not going to take the microsoft yeah i'm going to just take
[3:12:43.560 --> 3:12:49.480]  the side of facts evidence and that's how i'm going to choose to to face the story so initially
[3:12:49.480 --> 3:12:54.200]  when he said he was just jogging through the neighborhood in the video when i initially saw
[3:12:54.200 --> 3:12:59.560]  him all i saw him was walking you see him walking for about maybe 15 seconds he stops
[3:12:59.560 --> 3:13:07.320]  he looks around and then you see him sprint into um the the house yeah from that i'm like
[3:13:07.320 --> 3:13:11.960]  nobody behaves that way first things first he wasn't jogging i saw him walking the only time
[3:13:11.960 --> 3:13:18.040]  i saw him jogging initially was when he sprinted in somebody's house yeah right and no normal jogger
[3:13:18.040 --> 3:13:24.120]  doesn't go out and walk and stop and turn and look around and and sprint in somebody's house
[3:13:24.120 --> 3:13:28.600]  without their permission from initial when i saw the video i don't see an open house sign
[3:13:28.600 --> 3:13:34.360]  i don't see a house for sale i don't see him meeting the owner all i see is is this this
[3:13:34.360 --> 3:13:38.920]  the deceased person walk up to the house stop look around and run in the house which looks
[3:13:38.920 --> 3:13:45.400]  very suspicious yeah and from my experience i mean i never worked in law enforcement but we used to
[3:13:45.400 --> 3:13:49.800]  work retail security law enforcement i've made over a thousand arrests i've made some very good
[3:13:49.800 --> 3:13:54.440]  arrests i mean they even made some strong arm robbery risk as a private citizen yeah as a private
[3:13:54.440 --> 3:14:00.360]  citizen so well for the moment he walks into the house i mean we don't see i have all the footage
[3:14:00.360 --> 3:14:05.080]  from what i heard is about three minutes when he was inside the house you know the mc michael's
[3:14:05.080 --> 3:14:10.840]  jump on uh on the 911 and they say hey somebody just went in this house this has been an ongoing
[3:14:10.840 --> 3:14:19.000]  problem he catches that and he takes off running well you know what i like your point there that
[3:14:19.000 --> 3:14:23.800]  everyone comes with an agenda if you if you see that story break and you're like i sure hope that
[3:14:23.800 --> 3:14:29.800]  guy was a robber you're a racist if you're like i sure hope he was jogging you're a racist if you're
[3:14:29.800 --> 3:14:35.880]  like i sure hope we get to the truth and there's justice that's right where you should be right
[3:14:35.880 --> 3:14:40.680]  but so many people trying to be one they want to they want him to be a jogger or they want him to be
[3:14:40.680 --> 3:14:46.600]  a burglar but what i want is justice i like how you said it you guys have a seal carry permit
[3:14:46.600 --> 3:14:52.120]  you're like you carry a gun it's foolishness to go brandishing your gun for a jay walker or even
[3:14:52.120 --> 3:14:58.200]  someone who just broke in your house and we don't know what this is look i you said in your video
[3:14:58.200 --> 3:15:02.840]  you never seen black people jog i live in the west side of why i only see black people when
[3:15:02.840 --> 3:15:08.840]  they're jogging they jog here but but the reality is i've snooped around construction sites so what
[3:15:08.840 --> 3:15:14.600]  kind of a tractor is this oh what are you doing over here we don't know the case we really don't
[3:15:14.600 --> 3:15:21.880]  know it's just heartbreak and it's foolishness on all parts and we should just want justice
[3:15:22.600 --> 3:15:29.160]  thoughtfulness and people are eager right who more evidence for my agenda yeah yeah when the
[3:15:29.160 --> 3:15:33.400]  michael's gave chase to the young man i mean personally we wouldn't have gave chase yeah well
[3:15:33.400 --> 3:15:38.680]  i mean like we have concealed weapons permit we got guns yeah and we just do it we we have
[3:15:38.680 --> 3:15:43.720]  guns to preserve life somebody uh tries to hurt me on my family physically i can defend myself
[3:15:43.720 --> 3:15:48.760]  if i see somebody out in town maybe getting assaulted or raped or whatever that's when i
[3:15:48.760 --> 3:15:54.840]  want to pull my gun out i'm not using my gun to play rambo in case after somebody was trespassing
[3:15:54.840 --> 3:15:59.640]  or may have committed burglary because i know for a fact if i try to make a citizen's arrest
[3:15:59.640 --> 3:16:05.400]  because i've done it hundreds of times if it if things go wrong and now i'm possibly fighting
[3:16:05.400 --> 3:16:12.280]  over my gun now i got to end this dude's life over what trespassing burglary i mean i'm not
[3:16:12.280 --> 3:16:16.440]  going to put myself in position first we would have just called the cops maybe following them
[3:16:16.440 --> 3:16:20.680]  until the cops caught up and got the guy but yeah i'm not making a citizen's arrest or something
[3:16:20.680 --> 3:16:25.800]  like that but to the um and michael's defense um gregar among michael he's not ordinary since
[3:16:25.800 --> 3:16:31.000]  he's a retired cop so and it's his neighborhood yeah who it's not my right to tell him what he
[3:16:31.000 --> 3:16:37.720]  can and can't do only the constitution does that so right in the law yeah and i mean we could sit back
[3:16:37.720 --> 3:16:43.720]  and say he's a vigilante he shouldn't uh approach him but that's his right as a u.s citizen in united
[3:16:43.720 --> 3:16:48.920]  six america if you see somebody committing a crime and your president is a citizen you have
[3:16:48.920 --> 3:16:55.960]  every right to try to arrest that person you know yeah now i don't know in georgia i think you cannot
[3:16:55.960 --> 3:17:01.240]  claim self-defense if you're the aggressor so right i mean i don't i don't know what the law is
[3:17:01.240 --> 3:17:07.880]  going to say and and i just want there to be justice i i was a hoodlum as a kid i was arrested
[3:17:07.880 --> 3:17:13.800]  a lot i did a lot of bad things and there are a lot of my life i should have i could have been shot
[3:17:13.800 --> 3:17:18.600]  if someone has shot me they'd have been in the right um so i don't know what this case is we're
[3:17:18.600 --> 3:17:24.600]  gonna be coming back in uh in 20 seconds to talk to you more about this because there's the personal
[3:17:24.600 --> 3:17:29.640]  tragedy what happened to all the families in the neighborhoods involved and then there's a broader
[3:17:29.640 --> 3:17:34.200]  tragedy of how this is being used to divide the most united beautiful country in the history of
[3:17:34.200 --> 3:17:39.640]  the world i'm here with kevin keith hodge right back i don't have to tell you that we are in the
[3:17:39.640 --> 3:17:44.280]  most important point in human history the globalists have taken the gloves off and they've taken the
[3:17:44.280 --> 3:17:50.440]  mask off and they're like yeah you're taking implantable chips yeah we're into pedophilia yeah
[3:17:50.440 --> 3:17:56.840]  we're into world government yeah you're obsolete you are non-essential we are shutting your ass
[3:17:56.840 --> 3:18:02.200]  down yeah we told you don't be farmers and don't be ranchers and don't work in industry anymore
[3:18:02.200 --> 3:18:06.760]  you're going to be the service economy and now all the globalists are telling you that there's no
[3:18:06.760 --> 3:18:12.040]  more service economy and you're obsolete so you better bow down to them and get your universal
[3:18:12.040 --> 3:18:18.680]  pittance income so they can dictate your life the handcuffs are going on right now we have to resist
[3:18:18.680 --> 3:18:23.560]  and say no to the new world order and that takes you understanding you were right and understanding
[3:18:23.560 --> 3:18:29.640]  i was right and getting in people's faces and raising the alarm now while you still can now is
[3:18:29.640 --> 3:18:34.840]  the time for action now is the time for you to shine and be the paul reveres you know you are
[3:18:34.840 --> 3:18:43.720]  what info wars has been able to do thanks to your support and your prayers and your word of mouth
[3:18:43.720 --> 3:18:51.080]  has been nothing short of historic and truly epic this is the battle for the future of humanity
[3:18:51.640 --> 3:18:58.440]  and now open world government is being established with an end game to depopulate the planet
[3:18:58.440 --> 3:19:05.960]  now the internal operations of the globalists are being externalized you must decide which side
[3:19:05.960 --> 3:19:11.720]  you're on living in denial having mass Stockholm syndrome learned helplessness will only deliver
[3:19:11.720 --> 3:19:18.360]  you into misery destruction and finally death and this is a spiritual death we're talking about
[3:19:18.360 --> 3:19:25.560]  not just a physical death the delusions must end now info wars was correct about it all
[3:19:25.560 --> 3:19:29.960]  and we have come so far by exposing the enemy most people that are aware of the new world order
[3:19:29.960 --> 3:19:36.200]  decide to join it out of fear they are truly fearless we must fight this or lose our souls

[3:21:16.920 --> 3:21:25.560]  statement right that sounds about right yeah it's not saying much other twins it's on social media
[3:21:25.560 --> 3:21:30.840]  but it sounds no but no but it's true it's true and i want to say this about you guys like i'm
[3:21:30.840 --> 3:21:36.600]  on to you first of all i'm on to you you're you're like we're going to be funny we're going to be
[3:21:36.600 --> 3:21:42.040]  winsome we're going to be self deprecating but we are going to give the most real truth
[3:21:42.040 --> 3:21:47.880]  being spoken and you guys should be on abc nbc cbs prime time television i hope everyone subscribes
[3:21:47.880 --> 3:21:55.880]  to you and you speak real level headed thought out wisdom and you deliver it in the most incredible
[3:21:55.880 --> 3:22:02.760]  way your timing your humor is great but you take a lot of heat like you're the most winsome charming
[3:22:02.760 --> 3:22:10.120]  guys on the planet and heat comes after you and you would think when you have a message of truth
[3:22:10.120 --> 3:22:17.240]  and honesty and unity people would say you're a great guy everyone would love you does it
[3:22:17.240 --> 3:22:23.240]  surprise you a little bit about how much heat you get yeah i mean people want to hear the truth but
[3:22:23.240 --> 3:22:29.880]  only when it um makes them feel good when they when people hear truth that doesn't uh make them feel
[3:22:29.880 --> 3:22:37.080]  good then they uh they uh they don't want to hear it yeah like most people especially on the left i mean
[3:22:38.360 --> 3:22:43.240]  they've been taught to victimize yourself you know especially in the urban neighborhoods and in the
[3:22:43.240 --> 3:22:48.360]  black community i mean i mean from that video i didn't even take a side and we'd caught so much
[3:22:48.360 --> 3:22:52.680]  heat because we just want to pay not the facts i didn't want to pay plate racing to it i just want
[3:22:52.680 --> 3:22:57.400]  to talk evidence i want to talk facts i want to be race out of it because race has nothing to do
[3:22:57.400 --> 3:23:03.000]  with anything yeah i mean we got death threats people wishing harm to our kids yeah i mean people
[3:23:03.000 --> 3:23:07.320]  people want truth but they don't want to hear it when it hurts i'm like we was on fox news before
[3:23:07.320 --> 3:23:13.560]  we was a little bit too true on that so we haven't been on the six yeah you'll be banned in fox so
[3:23:14.520 --> 3:23:19.080]  the truth finds its audience you know the truth finds its audience and you're knitting together
[3:23:19.080 --> 3:23:25.400]  a beautiful tribe and our tribe today you know our tribe today the community of people sharing the
[3:23:25.400 --> 3:23:30.360]  truth they are the most unique diverse diverse in the superficial ways people always say to me
[3:23:30.360 --> 3:23:34.680]  your friends are sort of a man or not they're unique and beautiful and that they're charitable
[3:23:34.680 --> 3:23:40.200]  they respect other people's opinions they hear them out they're thoughtful and uh i think that's
[3:23:40.200 --> 3:23:45.160]  the that's the tribe the community that you're building the building around your show so when
[3:23:45.160 --> 3:23:50.360]  you got heat did you get heat from both sides on this video because you weren't you didn't give a pass
[3:23:50.360 --> 3:23:56.520]  to this father and son you said yo yeah i mean you implied they were not going to have you know
[3:23:57.560 --> 3:24:02.280]  yeah majority hate comments unfortunately a majority of the hate comments is from people on
[3:24:02.280 --> 3:24:08.120]  the left yeah i mean for the most part republicans conservative they agree with i would say 90 percent
[3:24:08.120 --> 3:24:13.400]  of what we said but a majority of the vitro all that we receive is from is from the left it's actually
[3:24:13.400 --> 3:24:22.200]  from african america so yeah unfortunately i mean i could show you my inbox in facebook and youtube
[3:24:22.200 --> 3:24:27.720]  and twitter it's all african americans yeah there's a couple white people but they have some like
[3:24:27.720 --> 3:24:35.080]  yeah constructive to say they're not wishing home to my family right right right so it's pretty sad
[3:24:35.080 --> 3:24:41.000]  actually because we came out conservative to help black people yeah i wanted to preach before we even
[3:24:41.000 --> 3:24:46.440]  got into politics our main goal in on our youtube channel was to make people laugh and i wanted to
[3:24:46.440 --> 3:24:51.080]  share a different a different opinion like the main reason why we came out as conservatives
[3:24:51.080 --> 3:24:56.440]  because i want to show black folks hey just use a little self-accountability don't worry about you
[3:24:56.440 --> 3:25:02.520]  can't control if racism if racism out there but you can't control your future you can control your
[3:25:02.520 --> 3:25:08.120]  actions you can do the right thing you can you can work hard make great decisions i don't care
[3:25:08.120 --> 3:25:13.160]  how racist you think this country is you will be successful yeah but unfortunately the leftists
[3:25:13.160 --> 3:25:18.840]  talk black people how to victimize themselves and and to welcome racism yeah and they actually
[3:25:18.840 --> 3:25:23.880]  believed that a majority of white people are racist which is totally not the case because i've
[3:25:23.880 --> 3:25:29.880]  traveled we traveled all over the world australia yeah a majority of our fans has always been white
[3:25:29.880 --> 3:25:35.320]  i don't see racism i don't remember the last time i've i've never met a white supremacist
[3:25:35.320 --> 3:25:42.680]  no but that no can i tell you on that no i say look if white supremacists are out there
[3:25:43.400 --> 3:25:47.960]  you think they're giving me a call you know you think they're giving me a call jason hey
[3:25:47.960 --> 3:25:54.760]  here's a membership card i've never gotten that i'm six with two blonde hair like i if there's
[3:25:54.760 --> 3:26:00.200]  a group of them out there they're having parties i'm not going but i'm a little offended i didn't
[3:26:00.200 --> 3:26:08.280]  get invited you know what i mean the last time jason i got called the n word is is because i damn
[3:26:08.280 --> 3:26:14.760]  they're killed this lady i almost ran off the road i kind of deserved but i've not seen racism
[3:26:14.760 --> 3:26:21.720]  man i don't see it i don't feel it yeah i mean they talk about how racist this country is i don't
[3:26:21.720 --> 3:26:29.400]  feel any of that yeah none of it why do you think people see now by the way you guys are making a
[3:26:29.400 --> 3:26:33.400]  lot of converts because i'm from a neighborhood most of my friends growing up were black i think
[3:26:33.400 --> 3:26:37.480]  you got to meet some of them that were with me at the trump hotel that i grew up with with this one
[3:26:37.480 --> 3:26:45.000]  friend and um they were sort of didn't know why i became so conservative and now they are all
[3:26:45.000 --> 3:26:51.480]  more conservative than me and um they're waking up you had you noticed now there's finally this
[3:26:51.480 --> 3:27:00.360]  realization that the media is being used to sort of um like you quoted melko maxx the most powerful
[3:27:00.360 --> 3:27:05.560]  instrument in the world right away kidding have you had people said i hated you i watched you
[3:27:05.560 --> 3:27:10.200]  because i was angry with you and now i agree with you thank you for your courage you get those
[3:27:10.200 --> 3:27:16.200]  messages yeah i mean i get that from time to time from um african americans well i like to call them
[3:27:16.200 --> 3:27:20.840]  black americans or no sex fans are african americans you wasn't born in africa but anyway i
[3:27:20.840 --> 3:27:24.680]  like a lot of people they've been they've been before i don't want to cut you off but black
[3:27:24.680 --> 3:27:29.000]  people like to call themselves african american i'm like african is not a race it's not you know
[3:27:29.000 --> 3:27:33.000]  i'm saying you can be white and african you be black and african but they've taught blacks in
[3:27:33.000 --> 3:27:37.960]  america that you're not just american you're african american i wish black people would say if you
[3:27:37.960 --> 3:27:42.120]  want to call yourself an american you can call yourself a black american but african american
[3:27:42.120 --> 3:27:46.680]  just because you have african answers it does not make you african yeah means you were born there
[3:27:46.680 --> 3:27:51.240]  but i mean look at elizabeth one just because you have might have zero point zero zero zero zero
[3:27:51.240 --> 3:27:55.800]  one percent native american doesn't make you native american unless you live that culture you know
[3:27:55.800 --> 3:28:00.280]  that culture yeah you experience that culture you practice it every day yeah i think our biggest
[3:28:00.280 --> 3:28:06.840]  impact has been with white liberals yeah i mean like that um that uh metaphor you used to begin
[3:28:06.840 --> 3:28:12.040]  your show you you can lead a horse to water but you can't make them drink it yeah i mean i can
[3:28:12.040 --> 3:28:16.920]  scream all day but if they're not willing to listen it's hard to convert people or make them see the
[3:28:16.920 --> 3:28:22.520]  light yeah and unfortunately a lot of black people in this country are biased because of our culture
[3:28:22.520 --> 3:28:27.480]  it's in our music it's in our tv shows it's in the the mainstream media yeah when you have an
[3:28:27.480 --> 3:28:32.360]  all when you have that system wrapped around black people it's really difficult to give them the
[3:28:32.360 --> 3:28:40.360]  seat of the side it really is that's a good point my wife is sorry i'm sorry i continue i didn't even
[3:28:40.360 --> 3:28:45.560]  interrupt okay i'm sorry like when i first came across bench and prayer i couldn't stand a guy
[3:28:47.400 --> 3:28:51.880]  i mean the first time i came across bench and prayer was that um horrible school shooting
[3:28:51.880 --> 3:28:56.360]  he was on prayers morgan now it's like man he was eating up prayers alive i'm like prayers say
[3:28:56.360 --> 3:29:03.080]  something but then you know it put a bug in my ear and over time i started listening i was like
[3:29:03.080 --> 3:29:07.320]  everything being said in that video everything these conservatives are saying everything that
[3:29:07.320 --> 3:29:13.320]  um tannis owens is saying all this stuff makes perfect sense it's just common sense yeah we used
[3:29:13.320 --> 3:29:19.480]  to be hate to say it yeah i used to be liberal yeah i actually voted for obama his first term but
[3:29:20.280 --> 3:29:25.880]  he was distraught it broke the camel's back he converted me to a conservatism yeah was obama
[3:29:25.880 --> 3:29:30.360]  because that's being small business owners i have to pay for my own medical insurance everything he
[3:29:30.360 --> 3:29:35.400]  said about obama care was alive he drove my insurance race through the roof and on top of that i lost
[3:29:35.400 --> 3:29:40.360]  coverage and that's my very first taste of socialism and i didn't like it because being a small business
[3:29:40.360 --> 3:29:46.920]  on what the left is preaching it kills small small businesses yeah and we saw how the left is
[3:29:46.920 --> 3:29:52.040]  destroyed for 40 years now small businesses in the black communities it makes a lot of sense to me
[3:29:52.040 --> 3:29:58.600]  but we guys we only got uh 40 seconds left i want to make sure everyone here follows you guys um
[3:29:59.640 --> 3:30:05.320]  give us all the platforms we're at and how people can follow you yeah sure um instagram it's official
[3:30:05.320 --> 3:30:11.960]  hogs twins yeah on facebook it's the hogs twins on youtube it's conservative twins and on twitter
[3:30:11.960 --> 3:30:19.080]  it's hogs twins yeah hope you remember all that now hey guys i got an idea for you uh you i was i was
[3:30:19.080 --> 3:30:23.400]  looking i wanted to follow your i wanted to go see you guys show when your live show is not even
[3:30:23.400 --> 3:30:30.200]  canceled i think you just need to go do shows where america's open and open up america yeah start
[3:30:30.200 --> 3:30:40.360]  to open up america tour we got some the panic that has been orchestrated by the global corporatist
[3:30:40.360 --> 3:30:47.320]  media and the chai comms is going to now trigger a worldwide depression in fact we're already into
[3:30:47.320 --> 3:30:52.760]  the worldwide depression and the death sentence for the third world but it's critical to understand
[3:30:52.760 --> 3:30:59.720]  that the longer the shutdown persists the worse it's going to be a month of shutdown will destroy
[3:30:59.720 --> 3:31:04.360]  decades of wealth that's been built up in a complex economy that's what we've always said it's
[3:31:04.360 --> 3:31:08.840]  important to be a prepper and to be somewhat self-sufficient because the globalists want to
[3:31:08.840 --> 3:31:15.560]  make us all dependent so that we're under their control they've admitted all of this so remember
[3:31:15.560 --> 3:31:21.240]  how does info wars continue years and decades in many cases to be able to predict things before
[3:31:21.240 --> 3:31:26.840]  they happen because we're following the globalist blueprint and their battle plan and yes it's
[3:31:26.840 --> 3:31:32.040]  dystopic and yes it's scary but denying it and letting them carry it out is a thousand times
[3:31:32.040 --> 3:31:39.400]  more scary it's time to stop the denial and realize what's really happening the united states is not
[3:31:39.400 --> 3:31:45.160]  communist china we don't have three million people in concentration camps we don't blow up churches
[3:31:45.160 --> 3:31:50.600]  we don't kill political dissidents and sell their organs but all over the news we see u n
[3:31:50.600 --> 3:31:57.640]  billable indicates w h o mainstream corporate media praising communist china for their response
[3:31:57.640 --> 3:32:02.520]  and if communist china shoots women at checkpoints and welds people into their houses and has robots
[3:32:02.520 --> 3:32:07.400]  controlling people well then gee we've got to do that and on top of it cities like san antonio
[3:32:07.400 --> 3:32:12.920]  pass laws saying will arrest you if you say chinese virus well now qualmo in new york's calling it the
[3:32:12.920 --> 3:32:19.320]  european virus these people are out of control control freaks and they are going to lose big time
[3:32:19.320 --> 3:32:23.880]  because we the people are aware of their criminal activities and are exposing them in their power
[3:32:23.880 --> 3:32:30.440]  grab the resistance lives at bandot video and info wars dot com spread those links and jam it down
[3:32:30.440 --> 3:32:34.680]  the censors throats and then we'll be able to defeat their operation that much quicker
[3:32:37.240 --> 3:32:41.400]  i don't like coming to you every day on the radio and tv stations that you watch and listen to a
[3:32:41.400 --> 3:32:45.880]  song and telling you all these horrible things but you notice almost everything we've talked about
[3:32:45.880 --> 3:32:52.760]  horrible has come true we were warning everybody to try to stop it it's like telling somebody if
[3:32:52.760 --> 3:32:57.400]  you got a pool put a fence around it if you have little kids because even if they're good swimmers
[3:32:57.400 --> 3:33:01.880]  they can hit their head and drown people don't listen they go out and their kids dead in the pool
[3:33:01.880 --> 3:33:06.200]  well ladies and gentlemen this is the death of the third world the collapse of the first world
[3:33:06.200 --> 3:33:12.280]  and this is 21st century warfare carried out by the globalist and they admit they've orchestrated
[3:33:12.280 --> 3:33:17.320]  it they admit it's quote good to save the earth and they're teaching us to be more frugal and
[3:33:17.320 --> 3:33:22.680]  they want to make us poor so they can dictate our surrender to this post-human technocracy
[3:33:22.680 --> 3:33:28.200]  i know all this sounds insane when i was talking about it 25 years ago but now it's public because
[3:33:28.200 --> 3:33:33.560]  it's their operations manual i wish this wasn't the case but they're really our evil psychopaths
[3:33:33.560 --> 3:33:39.880]  in control of most major institutions and we've got to stop them vitamin mineral fusion is one of
[3:33:39.880 --> 3:33:44.040]  our best-selling products it wasn't always that way we hardly ever promoted we first launched
[3:33:44.040 --> 3:33:49.560]  a few years ago but people slowly began to try it and almost everyone that orders it
[3:33:49.560 --> 3:33:57.240]  reorders it that's why we're offering it right now at m4slife.com at 50 off even though we're
[3:33:57.240 --> 3:34:01.560]  about to sell out because i want people who've been on the fence who've heard us talk about it
[3:34:01.560 --> 3:34:06.120]  who've read some of the reviews to experience it for yourself and this is important it's not just
[3:34:06.120 --> 3:34:10.920]  all the key vitamins and minerals you need it's also got amino acids that are known to help you
[3:34:10.920 --> 3:34:16.440]  absorb more of this into your body and that's really important for folks that are older because a
[3:34:16.440 --> 3:34:23.000]  lot of people don't absorb vitamins and minerals in pill form or caplet form but they get a higher
[3:34:23.000 --> 3:34:28.920]  absorption rate when it's liquid so this powdered formula goes great into water into other juices
[3:34:28.920 --> 3:34:33.800]  it's good for adults it's good for children take advantage of this super sale that's about to end
[3:34:33.800 --> 3:34:36.680]  at m4slife.com today with vitamin mineral fusion
[3:34:41.000 --> 3:34:43.640]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[3:34:43.640 --> 3:34:59.240]  welcome back to the alex jones show i am your guest host for the hour jason jones
[3:34:59.240 --> 3:35:03.800]  host of the podcast the jason jones show filmmaker and by the way i don't think i've ever
[3:35:03.800 --> 3:35:09.640]  promoted yet my new film divided hearts of america will be in theaters hopefully next fall
[3:35:09.640 --> 3:35:16.280]  if there are theaters opening which there should be right i hope so i wanted today's show to be on
[3:35:16.280 --> 3:35:21.960]  the theme of an article that i published today how many people how many africans and asians is
[3:35:21.960 --> 3:35:27.800]  the left willing to starve so trump loses the election and i wanted to focus on hunger around
[3:35:27.800 --> 3:35:34.040]  the world but i called an audible at the last minute and i really wanted to focus on unity
[3:35:34.040 --> 3:35:39.880]  this this issue of global food security is very important to me from the horn of africa
[3:35:39.880 --> 3:35:46.440]  really now across african asia into south america and even here in hawaii and i'm grateful for info
[3:35:46.440 --> 3:35:51.640]  wars really alex has been talking about this for two decades but really sounding the alarm as soon
[3:35:51.640 --> 3:35:57.480]  as the first covid crisis as soon as the covid crisis began to erupt info wars was the first place
[3:35:58.280 --> 3:36:03.560]  to talk about the famine a place that the world loves to call fake news well now the new yorker
[3:36:03.560 --> 3:36:13.960]  the wall street journal the new york times the nation the most left magazine you can find is
[3:36:13.960 --> 3:36:19.960]  acknowledging that the real concern now because of the covid shutdown is famine they're saying it's
[3:36:19.960 --> 3:36:25.560]  because of covid no it's because of the ham fisted thoughtless response to covid in uganda
[3:36:26.440 --> 3:36:32.680]  there hasn't been one death to covid but they're already suffering uh from famine
[3:36:32.680 --> 3:36:38.440]  so that's what i wanted to talk about and i guess i kind of did but but at the last minute i thought
[3:36:38.440 --> 3:36:44.760]  i'm seeing what's happening with amit aubrey and yesterday in hawaii a young hauli boy hauli
[3:36:44.760 --> 3:36:50.520]  caucasian kid 16 years old and a beach full of people sitting down was arrested by some police
[3:36:50.520 --> 3:36:56.520]  officers and there's concerns and thoughts that this could be racially motivated and i said i see
[3:36:56.520 --> 3:37:02.680]  what's going on here you know you can lead a horse to water but you can't lead a horse to water but
[3:37:02.680 --> 3:37:09.000]  you can salt the oats right there's they can't divide us they can't make us ignoble they can't
[3:37:09.000 --> 3:37:15.720]  make us bigots they can't make us racists but boy are they salting the oats they're really making it
[3:37:15.720 --> 3:37:22.360]  easy for to draw on our base instincts again if you look at that aubrey uh the amit aubrey case
[3:37:22.360 --> 3:37:28.840]  you have to check yourself if when you heard the story did you think man i hope he really was breaking
[3:37:28.840 --> 3:37:33.800]  into that house and wasn't a jogger or did you think man i really hope he was a jogger and these
[3:37:33.800 --> 3:37:40.280]  were two racists then you got to check yourself why did you want why did why were you betting on a
[3:37:40.280 --> 3:37:46.760]  narrative what your first thought should have been is this is a horrible tragedy families have been
[3:37:46.760 --> 3:37:53.320]  shattered a community has been shattered now our nation is being divided i sure hope your first
[3:37:53.320 --> 3:37:59.480]  thought should have been i sure hope that they get to the bottom of this i sure hope that the
[3:37:59.480 --> 3:38:06.840]  media communicates the truth and i sure hope justice is served whatever justice that is the big lie
[3:38:06.840 --> 3:38:13.080]  in our country has been that we've never been more divided that america's never been more divided
[3:38:13.080 --> 3:38:21.320]  because of president trump that was a lie until about 90 days ago but this covid crisis the shutdown
[3:38:21.320 --> 3:38:27.400]  they have been really good at using this to truly divide us before they were dividing us with rhetoric
[3:38:27.400 --> 3:38:33.960]  but now these divisions are becoming real so i just want in those last five minutes remind you of
[3:38:33.960 --> 3:38:42.120]  our history as a country first of all you know this is the new world and people came here from
[3:38:42.120 --> 3:38:45.960]  somewhere else and there were people here and there was conflict from the very beginning
[3:38:45.960 --> 3:38:52.040]  but do you know from the very beginning god winked at us when the puritan sailed here they
[3:38:52.040 --> 3:38:58.120]  were sailing away from england they were puritans they thought anglican england was too catholic
[3:38:58.120 --> 3:39:04.840]  and they wanted to be pure of any remnants of catholicism and so they sailed away to find their
[3:39:04.840 --> 3:39:11.960]  new jerusalem free of any remnants of catholicism or anglicanism but lo and behold who is the first
[3:39:11.960 --> 3:39:19.000]  person they meet squanto can you imagine well did you know squanto had been kidnapped sold into
[3:39:19.000 --> 3:39:26.360]  slavery then was redeemed by augustinian catholic monks he became a catholic and then the monks
[3:39:26.360 --> 3:39:33.240]  sent they gave him the money and sent him home his tribe was decimated by disease and a new
[3:39:33.240 --> 3:39:42.120]  tribe took him in it was squanto the only catholic in the new world and the whole eastern seaboard
[3:39:42.120 --> 3:39:49.160]  this one catholic who comes up and meets the puritans and saves the puritan's lives so you
[3:39:49.160 --> 3:39:56.920]  have a first nations person you have a catholic greeting puritans fleeing catholicism to me this
[3:39:56.920 --> 3:40:05.640]  is god winking at us saying leave your old prejudices in the old world leave your divisions
[3:40:05.640 --> 3:40:11.560]  in the old world and squanto not only saved the puritans but there was a peace treaty i believe
[3:40:11.560 --> 3:40:18.440]  it was 75 years the longest peace treaty that it was ever held i believe between uh the first
[3:40:18.440 --> 3:40:24.760]  nations and the colonists now it was a messy ugly brutal beginning then slavery came in
[3:40:24.760 --> 3:40:32.280]  we didn't invent slavery the old world formed the new world but from the very beginning even
[3:40:32.280 --> 3:40:38.200]  before we were a nation there were abolitionists and some of our founding fathers like george
[3:40:38.200 --> 3:40:45.240]  mason and john adams and his son john quincy adams were radically committed to abolition
[3:40:46.120 --> 3:40:51.880]  and there were there were slaves like james armistead the slave spy for washington who then
[3:40:51.880 --> 3:40:57.400]  was freed was really crucial in the founding of this republic the heist twins talked about
[3:40:57.400 --> 3:41:03.320]  african americans the reality is for most black americans they've been they've been here longer
[3:41:03.320 --> 3:41:08.200]  than most of us and our ancestors if you're like me if you're english you're irish you're german
[3:41:09.000 --> 3:41:15.000]  most of my ancestors didn't come into the late 19th century so this idea of making people feel
[3:41:15.000 --> 3:41:20.680]  less american we're not telling the stories of james armistead the slave spy who was probably the
[3:41:20.680 --> 3:41:27.000]  most important spy in the history of our republic then the catholics came in waves in the 19th
[3:41:27.000 --> 3:41:32.440]  century and there was division and there was real bigotry and they were fighting over a comma in the
[3:41:32.440 --> 3:41:37.000]  ten commandments in the public schools and that's how the ten commandments came and wave after wave
[3:41:37.000 --> 3:41:43.480]  of immigrants then there were the anti yellow laws my wife's parents came in 1949 fling mal
[3:41:43.480 --> 3:41:51.720]  they were chinese and now we are one country now most americans like the hajtun said they've never
[3:41:51.720 --> 3:41:57.240]  met anyone that was racist now we know there are people out there that hold the old bigotries
[3:41:57.800 --> 3:42:04.120]  and we know in times of crisis what's buried comes out but the reality is they were always here in
[3:42:04.120 --> 3:42:08.520]  the history of our country because they came from all the places we came from we brought that here
[3:42:08.520 --> 3:42:14.040]  with us but here is where we began to throw it off in the 20s and 30s if in irish they have
[3:42:14.040 --> 3:42:19.720]  catholic parishes in your neighborhood catholic i mean irish churches and polish churches and
[3:42:19.720 --> 3:42:24.360]  italian church is all catholic and the same part of philly why was that because the italians went
[3:42:24.360 --> 3:42:28.600]  to their church italians the irish went to their church the polish people went to their church and
[3:42:28.600 --> 3:42:34.280]  if their kids intermarried there was hell to pay it was a crisis it seems ridiculous to us today
[3:42:34.280 --> 3:42:44.280]  we need to be who we are we need to be the most united country in the world we are the most diverse
[3:42:44.280 --> 3:42:51.320]  country in the world we are the most united country in the world we are the most this is the most
[3:42:51.320 --> 3:42:57.720]  beautiful political community that one could have ever hoped to live with all the problems
[3:42:57.720 --> 3:43:04.680]  because we're not saints we weren't conceived before the fall for 330 fall in human 30 million
[3:43:04.680 --> 3:43:11.800]  fallen human beings i want to let the story on my grandfather's deathbed i was i was 16 years old
[3:43:11.800 --> 3:43:16.440]  he was at world war two in korean war vet i was never allowed to talk to him about the korean
[3:43:16.440 --> 3:43:21.400]  war i could ask him about world war two but never korea but on his deathbed and i was crying he said
[3:43:21.400 --> 3:43:28.520]  don't cry for me cry for all those young boys who died and i said in world war two grandpa i was
[3:43:28.520 --> 3:43:34.600]  trained not to bring up korea he said no i'm i'm thinking of korea right now i said all those american
[3:43:34.600 --> 3:43:39.720]  boys grandpa i'll think of them he said he died he didn't have families because i'm not talking
[3:43:39.720 --> 3:43:46.280]  about the american boys i'm talking about all those chinese and korean boys that we killed
[3:43:46.280 --> 3:43:54.520]  and they were just sent by a dictator butcher into our guns think of them too little did my grandpa
[3:43:54.520 --> 3:44:00.360]  know that his posterity from now until the end of time all of my descendants will be part chinese
[3:44:01.080 --> 3:44:06.760]  and there was my grandpa an old guy born in the early 20th century a big white guy who on his
[3:44:06.760 --> 3:44:12.760]  deathbed was thinking of thinking of those boys that he had to fight as a young man that's who
[3:44:12.760 --> 3:44:17.960]  our country is made up of that's who our grandparents are that's who our friends and family and
[3:44:17.960 --> 3:44:24.520]  neighbors are whatever their ethnicity now i want to thank you first of all i had to my little
