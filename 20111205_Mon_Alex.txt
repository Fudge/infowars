[00:00.000 --> 00:12.100]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[00:12.100 --> 00:36.780]  keys Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones
[00:36.780 --> 00:43.220]  live kicking off another week of transmission against tyranny you have
[00:43.220 --> 00:48.380]  found at the front lines in the info war we are desperately attempting to alert
[00:48.380 --> 00:53.180]  not just the people of the United States but the people of the planet to one of
[00:53.180 --> 00:57.420]  the latest attempts at global domination that we've seen in history this
[00:57.420 --> 01:05.220]  one a corptocracy a type of high-tech technocratic oligarchy that calls
[01:05.220 --> 01:11.220]  itself the new world order it is inherently anti-human its base
[01:11.220 --> 01:19.100]  ideology its core driver is eugenics and we're gonna be live here for the next
[01:19.100 --> 01:24.780]  three hours the top legal advisor and constitutional law scholar Bruce Fine
[01:24.780 --> 01:31.780]  will be joining us for 30 minutes at the start of the third hour today but in
[01:31.780 --> 01:37.060]  the balance of the broadcast we're going to cover incredibly important news and
[01:37.060 --> 01:42.340]  take your phone calls I was on coast-to-coast AM last night on the
[01:42.340 --> 01:47.740]  Sunday edition and certainly enjoyed being on with their weekend host a very
[01:47.740 --> 01:54.220]  very informative very very a smart guy I want to get him on as a guest Rob Simone
[01:54.220 --> 01:59.980]  they have just amazing fill in host as well over there so I want to thank them
[01:59.980 --> 02:04.620]  for having me on to cover of course the incredibly important National Defense
[02:04.620 --> 02:10.140]  Authorization Act I opened the phones up yesterday on the Sunday show from four
[02:10.140 --> 02:14.780]  to six it took a lot of calls from police and military all of which that
[02:14.780 --> 02:20.260]  called in were very much against using the military on the streets of America
[02:20.260 --> 02:28.140]  but then in DAA 2012 they've passed and I was gonna go on to the president is far
[02:28.140 --> 02:31.860]  worse than just that it declares the whole world a battlefield basically
[02:31.860 --> 02:36.980]  declares war on the whole planet quite a unilateral declaration of war which is
[02:36.980 --> 02:42.380]  what eugenics really is and it allows of course the secret arrest and internment
[02:42.380 --> 02:46.420]  of the American people anybody who ever made fun of us for talking about FEMA
[02:46.420 --> 02:49.700]  camps and the emergency centers establishment act and the executive
[02:49.700 --> 02:53.220]  orders because they hadn't looked at the facts well they can't really laugh at
[02:53.220 --> 02:57.260]  us now can they in fact they should be thanking us for warning them and asking
[02:57.260 --> 03:01.620]  us how we knew but instead it's well you're still cooks yeah they're announcing
[03:01.620 --> 03:05.180]  a global bank of the world will all pay our taxes to that engineered the collapse
[03:05.180 --> 03:08.300]  and yeah they're setting up FEMA camps and yeah they're saying they want to
[03:08.300 --> 03:12.020]  start arresting citizens and the TSA setting up setting up checkpoints on
[03:12.020 --> 03:18.820]  highways but you're still bad it'd be like an NFL football player who played
[03:18.820 --> 03:23.260]  20 seasons and never lost a game an NFL quarterback who made two or three
[03:23.260 --> 03:27.540]  touchdowns per game and and it'd be like the media saying he's the worst
[03:27.540 --> 03:35.460]  football player ever he's scum he wins every Super Bowl 20 years in a row most
[03:35.460 --> 03:41.900]  valuable player that's what the patriot movement is absolutely right absolutely
[03:41.900 --> 03:46.660]  full of courage day one doing the research day one warning people day one
[03:46.660 --> 03:53.260]  for 50 years or more being attacked demonized killed imprisoned because the
[03:53.260 --> 03:57.220]  you know the federal reserve took over in 1913 it's just been absorbing the
[03:57.220 --> 04:01.540]  rest of the country we were an incredibly free nation and now here we are
[04:01.540 --> 04:05.980]  down the road last 50 years or so has really been the acceleration of it and
[04:05.980 --> 04:09.940]  they've totally engineered our society and you couldn't recognize it from what
[04:09.940 --> 04:14.980]  it was 50 years ago basic liberties are anathema and are the enemy in the
[04:14.980 --> 04:20.420]  culture private property is the enemy the family is the enemy and every form
[04:20.420 --> 04:27.060]  of degeneracy and weakness and fraud is like ambrosia or the ether in which
[04:27.060 --> 04:31.460]  we're supposed to swim but for every action there's an equal and opposite
[04:31.460 --> 04:35.940]  reaction we are that reaction to this tyranny we are the counter revolutionaries
[04:35.940 --> 04:40.180]  we are the restorationist here trying to bring our republic back all right it's

[08:04.500 --> 08:25.980]  the GCN radio network I'm your host Alex Jones thank you so much for joining
[08:25.980 --> 08:33.420]  us if you're a new listener this radio show is not left-wing or right-wing we
[08:33.420 --> 08:40.420]  are constitutionalist we believe in Liberty and freedom and due process the
[08:40.420 --> 08:44.580]  bill of rights the Constitution the Declaration of Independence there is no
[08:44.580 --> 08:51.260]  better document or group of documents there is no political system that has
[08:51.260 --> 08:57.300]  ever created so much wealth and freedom and dignity as what our Republic has
[08:57.300 --> 09:02.140]  basically brought in you judge a tree by its fruits now we never fully realize
[09:02.140 --> 09:06.220]  the promises of the Declaration of Independence Constitution Bill of Rights
[09:06.220 --> 09:14.380]  but we we went further than any other nation ever has and so the bounty was so
[09:14.380 --> 09:21.980]  giant that we became absolutely slack-jawed and decadent and we are
[09:21.980 --> 09:26.380]  waking up homeless on the continent our forefathers conquered as Thomas
[09:26.380 --> 09:32.700]  Jefferson warned we would to the private banking cartels and now we are here at
[09:32.700 --> 09:37.860]  the very end at the very end of the collapsing Republic and things are just
[09:37.860 --> 09:43.660]  going to go down hill from here very very quickly if we don't put the brakes
[09:43.660 --> 09:47.580]  on and it may be too late but if you're gonna go ahead and slide down a cliff
[09:47.580 --> 09:53.020]  you might as well try to grab hold of the side and slow your descent or hopefully
[09:53.020 --> 09:59.380]  not fall all the way and just break your leg on a ledge and then wait for help
[09:59.380 --> 10:04.460]  we know that if the New World Order is fully brought into fruition it is not
[10:04.460 --> 10:10.740]  going to be a pretty sight now let me just do this I'm gonna do what I did
[10:10.740 --> 10:16.620]  yesterday because I think it was a very informative at least in the first hour
[10:16.620 --> 10:21.540]  and a little bit into the second hour I'm gonna open the phones up just for
[10:21.540 --> 10:33.420]  police current police and military I would like to hear from you are you
[10:33.420 --> 10:43.020]  going to go along with what we see happening major banks taking houses
[10:43.020 --> 10:46.500]  they don't even have the deeds to and in some cases they don't even own and
[10:46.500 --> 10:52.180]  never had a deed to just just houses that they have no claim to knowingly
[10:52.180 --> 10:57.220]  taking them are you going to set up checkpoints as local police become more
[10:57.220 --> 11:02.940]  and more federalized under FEMA and the 10 regions and the threat fusion centers
[11:02.940 --> 11:10.820]  are you going to take blood draws at checkpoints on the highways as the
[11:10.820 --> 11:14.940]  federal government is financing police departments across the nation to do are
[11:14.940 --> 11:19.060]  you going to take part in the model states health emergency powers act for
[11:19.060 --> 11:22.580]  forced inoculation by the way you're going to be forced to take a bunch of
[11:22.580 --> 11:28.540]  shots as well bunch of deadly vaccines have been proven to be very dangerous by
[11:28.540 --> 11:36.300]  design are you concerned enough to even have the courage to call in because you
[11:36.300 --> 11:40.700]  talked a lot of police and people off record they're like I'd call in when I
[11:40.700 --> 11:44.260]  see cops on the street across the country wherever I go they'll come over and
[11:44.260 --> 11:48.620]  hey I like your show a lot of the people you know at the at the headquarters at
[11:48.620 --> 11:54.260]  the office like you but we're just you know scared to stick our heads up if you
[11:54.260 --> 11:58.100]  can't stick your head up because you know everything's spied on everything's
[11:58.100 --> 12:04.260]  monitored if you can't even take the step of calling in we had police calling
[12:04.260 --> 12:07.660]  in yesterday and they're like yeah I know everything's listened to and
[12:07.660 --> 12:14.100]  everything's put in a database it's just amazing Alex so so it is true to
[12:14.100 --> 12:17.260]  call in because a lot of you are sitting in your squad car and you're saying I'm
[12:17.260 --> 12:20.700]  not going to call in phones are all listened and tracked and traced they'll
[12:20.700 --> 12:24.540]  they'll know I'm calling into a show wow you really live in a free country you
[12:24.540 --> 12:29.620]  can't call into a talk radio show see right there is total proof of what we
[12:29.620 --> 12:33.980]  are and what we've become because I run into police all the time or they write
[12:33.980 --> 12:42.300]  me letters with you know a general return address and they they break down
[12:42.300 --> 12:45.580]  the fact that they know everything surveilled and that we're living in a
[12:45.580 --> 12:52.700]  police state well so what we're not the bad guys if the system wants to come
[12:52.700 --> 12:59.580]  get me come get me here I am and I'm not saying bring it on like George Bush said
[12:59.580 --> 13:04.900]  I'm just here doing my job telling the truth not selling out standing up for
[13:04.900 --> 13:08.860]  free humanity I know who the criminals are we've proven who the criminals are
[13:08.860 --> 13:12.860]  I'm gonna go through more evidence backing up everything we've said today just
[13:12.860 --> 13:23.140]  pouring out right now but you have a decision to make there are really no
[13:23.140 --> 13:28.300]  countries in history in modern history the last 200 years or so where the
[13:28.300 --> 13:32.420]  government puts on paper that it can secretly arrest you and disappear you
[13:32.420 --> 13:36.900]  and torture you and kill you because you add this new bill in with the past
[13:36.900 --> 13:41.020]  bills and with what Obama put out last Monday with his lawyers saying we don't
[13:41.020 --> 13:46.980]  need this bill we can kill Americans whenever we want no judge no jury I
[13:46.980 --> 13:53.780]  don't need Congress to launch a new war remember that with the Libya situation
[13:53.780 --> 13:59.540]  months and months ago this is a time when the system is just overthrowing the
[13:59.540 --> 14:04.580]  Bill of Rights and Constitution and when I get calls and emails and see comments
[14:04.580 --> 14:10.100]  on info wars.com and prisonplanet.com it's the vast minority but we also got
[14:10.100 --> 14:15.700]  this when we sent Darren McBrain and John Bown out on the streets last Friday
[14:15.700 --> 14:19.660]  for the nightly news I played a clip of this last night and and and two or three
[14:19.660 --> 14:24.420]  people they ran into the vast majority were awake and concerned veterans and
[14:24.420 --> 14:27.580]  others about obviously having the military involved in the streets if that
[14:27.580 --> 14:30.140]  isn't bad enough by the way we'll secretly arrest you and you'll just
[14:30.140 --> 14:33.460]  disappear into a black hole and by the way the whole world's a battlefield now
[14:33.460 --> 14:39.580]  they just declare unilateral war on the whole planet Congress just says here's
[14:39.580 --> 14:46.740]  all our authority take it but the minority says well I have nothing to hide
[14:46.740 --> 14:55.100]  I've done nothing wrong I'm a good guy what foolish ignorant childlike people
[14:55.100 --> 15:01.460]  those are famous last words if a home invader comes in your house and ties
[15:01.460 --> 15:05.300]  you up and rapes your wife in front of you before beating your children's
[15:05.300 --> 15:13.140]  brains out I mean how could that happen you didn't do anything wrong if your
[15:13.140 --> 15:19.020]  house burns down because you left the fireplace you're too full of wood and
[15:19.020 --> 15:24.420]  coals jump out while you're at the store or whatever and your house burns down
[15:24.420 --> 15:28.820]  I mean how could that happen you you're not a bad person you know that's the
[15:28.820 --> 15:32.180]  same thing with the teenage girls and young women that would get in the car
[15:32.180 --> 15:36.500]  with Ted Bundy over and over again he was wearing a suit he looked non-threatening
[15:36.500 --> 15:39.620]  it was a cute little yellow car and he admitted he got it because it was cute
[15:39.620 --> 15:44.940]  oh I mean this can't be a serial killer he's driving a yellow Volkswagen
[15:44.940 --> 15:51.140]  Beetle he's wearing a nice little tweed suit oh the big megabags couldn't hurt
[15:51.140 --> 15:55.820]  us they're they're old men with bald heads who walk with a limp they're
[15:55.820 --> 16:06.140]  non-threatening I mean Hitler he's a military highly decorated got the iron
[16:06.140 --> 16:09.140]  cross first class that's the Congressional Medal of Honor in Germany
[16:09.140 --> 16:12.860]  well they had like 10 classes of it World War One he had iron cross first
[16:12.860 --> 16:17.140]  class he must be a good guy people ask how Hitler got elected I mean he was a
[16:17.140 --> 16:21.740]  Congressional Medal of Honor winner that's how he got elected he was a
[16:21.740 --> 16:25.780]  message runner for two years in World War One nerve gas repeatedly he'd run
[16:25.780 --> 16:29.940]  across enemy lines over and over and over again when the lines were
[16:29.940 --> 16:35.420]  intertwined deliver messages that's why he was a he was a multi-time iron cross
[16:35.420 --> 16:41.020]  winner of course he was a bad guy but but wait a minute he's a Congressional
[16:41.020 --> 16:48.820]  Medal of Honor winner in Germany he can't be bad it's the same thing over
[16:48.820 --> 16:55.340]  and over again 100% this country has terminal cancer terminal political
[16:55.340 --> 16:59.340]  cancer and it may be too late to remove it now you're more and more I'm doing
[16:59.340 --> 17:04.620]  research and just getting prepared to shift into totally remnant defensive
[17:04.620 --> 17:11.700]  mode not and I'm not happy about that believe me I mean at a certain point I'm
[17:11.700 --> 17:15.100]  gonna have to tell folks to go ahead and start digging in go ahead and get fire
[17:15.100 --> 17:20.380]  arms go ahead and get ready I'm not pleased about this we knew this was
[17:20.380 --> 17:22.700]  coming
[17:24.860 --> 17:31.660]  it is what it is it is what it is I mean the government declares war on the
[17:31.660 --> 17:35.740]  Constitution that's I'm not just saying that this is war against the
[17:35.740 --> 17:40.540]  Constitution war against our freedoms war against our founders ideals war
[17:40.540 --> 17:44.540]  against everything our veterans have fought and died for declares worldwide
[17:44.540 --> 17:51.660]  war sales torture and everything is great and and all of us have a decision
[17:51.660 --> 17:56.300]  to make what side we're gonna be on you have a decision and they're gonna run
[17:56.300 --> 18:00.100]  the psy ops where the rollout of the military and the rollout of the FEMA
[18:00.100 --> 18:04.140]  camps is gonna look like it's to help the public and the military is gonna
[18:04.140 --> 18:07.940]  restore order and the military is gonna stop hordes of welfare people burning
[18:07.940 --> 18:12.900]  down cities and it's after all of that comes that then they start arresting
[18:12.900 --> 18:19.220]  people and even if you've got a tyranny as long as there's still courts you you've
[18:19.220 --> 18:22.660]  got a chance but when they start talking like this you don't have a chance you
[18:22.660 --> 18:26.740]  can't go to the FEMA camp you can't disappear into a black hole and at that
[18:26.740 --> 18:31.500]  point everybody has a right and a duty if you were in Soviet Russia Nazi
[18:31.500 --> 18:36.180]  Germany Maoist China America can't go this way we can't just bend over the
[18:36.180 --> 18:43.860]  barrel and say have your way with us can't do it and you got to think about
[18:43.860 --> 18:51.420]  these scenarios but never never never draw first blood never if you're in some
[18:51.420 --> 18:54.260]  group you know military training group or whatever people come shooting their
[18:54.260 --> 18:57.860]  mouths off about offensive operations that's a hundred percent of fed trying
[18:57.860 --> 19:03.540]  to set you up or a foreign asset or a mercenary no you are above board this
[19:03.540 --> 19:10.460]  needs to be above board preparing to defend the republic period and that's
[19:10.460 --> 19:18.380]  it and you never draw first blood and you never are offensive now once
[19:18.380 --> 19:23.380]  somebody attacks you it's a different story but we're in an info war and
[19:23.380 --> 19:26.700]  there's been a lot of cases in history where right when things get bad things
[19:26.700 --> 19:31.100]  can turn around there's a lot of different scenarios there's a lot of other
[19:31.100 --> 19:34.300]  sub-level elites that don't like what's happening they could get together turn
[19:34.300 --> 19:38.100]  the tide the system could could realize they're not gonna be able to carry this
[19:38.100 --> 19:42.500]  out do their breakdown actuaries and realizes they're not gonna win there's
[19:42.500 --> 19:46.820]  a lot of things that could happen but you've got to understand that the

[24:11.100 --> 24:17.940]  sunshine I don't know okay let me just run over a smattering of the news then
[24:17.940 --> 24:24.060]  we'll go to your phone calls now I'll go back into all this in detail but if you
[24:24.060 --> 24:30.180]  are police or military there's no longer any denial I'd like to hear from you
[24:30.180 --> 24:34.780]  about the fact that from Europe to the United States from Canada to Australia
[24:34.780 --> 24:39.780]  every Western country is fully overthrowing the Magna Carta Magna Carta
[24:39.780 --> 24:44.260]  is the basis of all of this common law you can just type in Magna Carta
[24:44.260 --> 24:49.140]  overturned by judge and you'll see articles all over England and Australia
[24:49.140 --> 24:54.780]  New Zealand where they say the Magna Carta is dead they're flaunting it Obama
[24:54.780 --> 24:58.380]  became the head of the UN Security Council in violation of article one
[24:58.380 --> 25:04.060]  section 9 never happened total violation of federal law and the
[25:04.060 --> 25:10.140]  Constitution for the president to be the head of a foreign body it's happening
[25:10.140 --> 25:15.580]  they are they are breaking our laws in front of us to set the president while
[25:15.580 --> 25:20.260]  throwing unconstitutional laws at us throwing the book at the general
[25:20.260 --> 25:25.940]  public now I've always told you they want to use the military they want to
[25:25.940 --> 25:32.900]  secretly arrest us why the globalists want to dominate America is the prize
[25:32.900 --> 25:38.700]  the biggest military the wealth everything so while they've been sucking
[25:38.700 --> 25:44.060]  the wealth out of us they've been setting up this global control grid and
[25:44.060 --> 25:48.260]  now they know that we're awake to this and that we're going into a final phase
[25:48.260 --> 25:52.340]  so they've set up Homeland Security you know police send me emails and call the
[25:52.340 --> 25:56.060]  show they did yesterday and they talk about how ridiculous it is that the
[25:56.060 --> 26:01.020]  feds come in and say you know in the old days we dealt with you know choplifters
[26:01.020 --> 26:05.780]  and crime and stuff like that you will deal on a daily basis with truck bombs
[26:05.780 --> 26:11.900]  improvised explosive devices and Patriot groups shooting you now today that's
[26:11.900 --> 26:15.700]  ridiculous that's one out of a million but in a way it's twisted and true
[26:15.700 --> 26:20.900]  because as the criminal government wages war against the people and has set up
[26:20.900 --> 26:25.340]  the architecture of their attack profile against veterans retired police
[26:25.340 --> 26:30.540]  conservatives you're all in a database it's on record just get ready for it as
[26:30.540 --> 26:35.820]  this happens as you become a persecuted class they know large portions of you
[26:35.820 --> 26:39.340]  are actually going to fight back and so instead of having to stage terror attacks
[26:39.340 --> 26:44.180]  like Oklahoma City you're actually going to fight them and of course they'll
[26:44.180 --> 26:48.660]  blow up some some daycares and stuff like Oklahoma City to blame you for it
[26:48.660 --> 26:52.340]  for Cyop but most of it's just going to be people that well I'm not going to sit
[26:52.340 --> 26:55.580]  here in my house and wait for them to come confiscate my guns I'll just go
[26:55.580 --> 26:59.380]  out and face them I mean you don't sit there in your house once this stuff
[26:59.380 --> 27:04.060]  kicks off okay but we're trying to stop that I'm talking about this because
[27:04.060 --> 27:11.860]  that's what comes next I keep telling you ABCDEFG I keep taking you right down
[27:11.860 --> 27:22.900]  to Z and right now we're down to basically down to Q or so I mean Z is not a
[27:22.900 --> 27:30.020]  nice place to be Z's like living under Mao Zedong during his heyday it's about
[27:30.020 --> 27:35.300]  like living in 1943 Germany and people asked well why would elites do this
[27:35.300 --> 27:40.580]  because they're so full of arrogance, Hutzpah, Bravada, whatever you want to
[27:40.580 --> 27:46.980]  call it, hubris, I mean why did Corzine make a 40 to one bet with with people's
[27:46.980 --> 27:51.420]  private bank accounts on MF Global because they're crazy they're out of
[27:51.420 --> 27:56.980]  control they're nuts they're bold they've gotten away with so much anybody who
[27:56.980 --> 28:01.460]  studied criminology knows this once a criminal gets away with things over and
[28:01.460 --> 28:06.900]  over and over again they get out of control they start thinking they're
[28:06.900 --> 28:10.120]  invincible why have I harped to police and military all these years I'm getting
[28:10.120 --> 28:14.940]  chills right now because I studied history I studied criminology I started
[28:14.940 --> 28:19.060]  studying it because I thought it was entertaining when I was like 12 years old
[28:19.060 --> 28:22.420]  and I was a jock who liked to read history books because they were laying
[28:22.420 --> 28:28.540]  around the house and I picked them up like wow this is really entertaining all
[28:28.540 --> 28:33.380]  these battles and secret police and subterfuge groups and secret societies
[28:33.380 --> 28:37.540]  and German history and World War two and Confederate history and Northern
[28:37.540 --> 28:42.860]  history and Byzantine history and Japanese history and then I went to
[28:42.860 --> 28:45.460]  college and they're like world government's goodness taking over your
[28:45.460 --> 28:48.940]  guns are bad your family's bad and I'm like I read about this this sounds like
[28:48.940 --> 28:54.460]  Hitler this is eugenics I mean I knew it because I've read hundreds of history
[28:54.460 --> 28:59.060]  books and then I got into reading books about criminals and psychopaths first I
[28:59.060 --> 29:02.300]  was reading books about gangsters and bank robbers and then I read books about
[29:02.300 --> 29:06.660]  psychopaths I started watching watching court TV with Jeffrey Dahmer trial and
[29:06.660 --> 29:11.540]  I just got into this and I learned about the world most people know about
[29:11.540 --> 29:15.540]  football or whatever I know about the world and I'm gonna ask you police and
[29:15.540 --> 29:19.060]  military you're where the rubber's gonna meet the road aren't we is there anything
[29:19.060 --> 29:22.980]  you won't do is there any order you won't follow is there any line in the

[33:25.340 --> 33:30.900]  know that obviously you gentlemen and ladies are normally working during the
[33:30.900 --> 33:35.700]  weekday show weekday shows probably twice as big as the Sunday show but I
[33:35.700 --> 33:40.420]  still love the Sunday show it reaches over a million people about a million
[33:40.420 --> 33:45.220]  a half or so but I've always noticed during the weekday broadcast it's harder
[33:45.220 --> 33:50.980]  to get police and military to call in because they're working but we do have
[33:50.980 --> 33:55.260]  one military current serving military and one police officer on hold I'm gonna
[33:55.260 --> 34:00.380]  get to you here in just a moment but others need to call in you need to call
[34:00.380 --> 34:04.940]  in if you're on your donut breaker or whatever and you need to get past the
[34:04.940 --> 34:10.540]  fear that oh my gosh you know this is all data-based which it is we need to be
[34:10.540 --> 34:15.580]  honest about that you know what if you get fired because they've got a data
[34:15.580 --> 34:20.500]  base and you called into a talk radio show when you were off work see that
[34:20.500 --> 34:24.340]  just illustrates what I'm talking about of course the truth is it just goes into
[34:24.340 --> 34:29.900]  a database we need to be honest about how much trouble this country's in only
[34:29.900 --> 34:33.020]  by being honest about it can we turn this around it's your first amendment
[34:33.020 --> 34:40.140]  right but it does show the chilling effect that's out there today 800-259
[34:40.140 --> 34:47.260]  92 31 is the toll-free number to join us okay let me just go over the news I
[34:47.260 --> 34:51.820]  have today I mentioned this yesterday when it was in the New York Times and I
[34:51.820 --> 34:56.940]  was expecting this to happen because when Fast and Furious came out earlier in
[34:56.940 --> 35:02.180]  the year CBS 60 minutes did a whitewash and said it was a few gun shops where
[35:02.180 --> 35:06.780]  they allowed guns to be sold to cartels to track them of course it turned out it
[35:06.780 --> 35:11.020]  was already in federal court that's why CBS did the whitewash that they were
[35:11.020 --> 35:15.020]  shipping tens of thousands of guns into Mexico Honduras but also Illinois
[35:15.020 --> 35:20.820]  Indiana California Texas Florida two drug gangs to kill the competition that
[35:20.820 --> 35:24.660]  didn't launder its money through globalist banks and it's all on record
[35:24.660 --> 35:27.820]  the big banks laundering hundreds of billions a year you want an example
[35:27.820 --> 35:31.380]  you're a new listener well Covia Wells Fargo last year admitted they laundered
[35:31.380 --> 35:37.460]  376 billion dollars in two years okay it's a 500 billion a year but that was
[35:37.460 --> 35:42.780]  their cut they didn't get any trouble for it you know there's a federal
[35:42.780 --> 35:47.100]  regulation that allows foreign drug dealers to invest in the stock market
[35:47.100 --> 35:50.740]  the head of the New York Stock Exchange back in 99 Richard Grasso I have the
[35:50.740 --> 35:54.700]  Reuters article somewhere around here I've done shows on it he went and was
[35:54.700 --> 35:58.460]  photographed with the head of the FARC saying invest with us all your cocaine
[35:58.460 --> 36:02.300]  money or willing to have you invaded the head of the FARC said no took him a
[36:02.300 --> 36:05.580]  year to kill him but they didn't bomb him and kill him and of course US special
[36:05.580 --> 36:10.660]  forces went in and and they've got GPS planes that spray only the cocoa fields
[36:10.660 --> 36:16.460]  they don't own it was a giant covert invasion to try to keep the prices up
[36:16.460 --> 36:21.180]  you know oh you bet our militaries they're didn't force a 500 billion dollar a
[36:21.180 --> 36:25.580]  year drug traffic into this country marijuana cocaine and heroin they
[36:25.580 --> 36:29.620]  really hate methamphetamine because they can't control it that's something the
[36:29.620 --> 36:33.500]  local police make money off of the I see cases where sometimes little bitty
[36:33.500 --> 36:39.060]  towns have your 2030 meth labs oh and the police don't know of course it'll also
[36:39.060 --> 36:43.500]  fry your brain absolutely kill you speed kills all this stuff's horrible I'm not
[36:43.500 --> 36:48.860]  endorsing it I'm just saying you make this stuff illegal and it allows massive
[36:48.860 --> 36:52.340]  profits to corrupt your police which is the plan so the British took down the
[36:52.340 --> 36:58.140]  Chinese study the opium wars its mainline history the Chinese were dumb
[36:58.140 --> 37:02.420]  enough to make drugs illegal and the British said we're taking over and
[37:02.420 --> 37:06.100]  within 50 years they had the whole country under their control by corrupting
[37:06.100 --> 37:09.500]  police taking control of organized crime alright I said I'm going to your calls
[37:09.500 --> 37:15.180]  see I preface this I preface this US agents launder drug money report
[37:15.180 --> 37:20.500]  French news agency and this was in again New York Times yesterday but oh they
[37:20.500 --> 37:25.620]  they laundered the drug money and the drugs to track it to understand it it
[37:25.620 --> 37:30.220]  says citing unnamed current and former federal law enforcement the newspaper
[37:30.220 --> 37:33.380]  said the agents primarily with the drug enforcement agency have handled
[37:33.380 --> 37:36.820]  shipments of hundreds of thousands of dollars and illegal cash across borders
[37:36.820 --> 37:42.340]  it said they did it to understand how the criminal operations moved the money
[37:42.340 --> 37:51.100]  oh they did it to understand oh Satan consorted with demons in the pit of hell
[37:51.100 --> 37:58.100]  to learn how demons operate mm-hmm Jeffrey Dahmer kidnapped children
[37:58.100 --> 38:08.980]  and tortured them and raped them to find out about serial killers no no no no
[38:08.980 --> 38:15.820]  unbelievable I mean this is like in the 30s 40s and 50s and in the 20s during
[38:15.820 --> 38:21.020]  prohibition J Edgar Hoover would go on radio and newsreels and then TV and say
[38:21.020 --> 38:26.220]  there's no organized crime it does not exist because they would only by small
[38:26.220 --> 38:33.140]  people delivering bathtub gin and money that wasn't part of a larger gang I mean
[38:33.140 --> 38:35.780]  if you were trying to make your own whiskey or moonshine and what and this
[38:35.780 --> 38:39.420]  song record and weren't laundering it through the Kennedys and the Capones
[38:39.420 --> 38:44.660]  and the and bugsy seagull and and all the rest of them and the Rockefellers
[38:44.660 --> 38:49.500]  they were the real kingpins over at all go research it they would send police the
[38:49.500 --> 38:54.700]  untouchables the untouchables would come out to your shack and kill you the ATF
[38:54.700 --> 39:00.340]  was the original whiskey regulators going back to post civil war and the the
[39:00.340 --> 39:08.420]  whiskey rebellion over the tax they the FBI and people and and and ATF the
[39:08.420 --> 39:12.980]  whiskey regulators they weren't coming and fighting gangsters they'd come to
[39:12.980 --> 39:17.180]  your farm in the depression if you were brewing whiskey to try to to try to
[39:17.180 --> 39:20.940]  survive and sell at the city and they'd line you up and blow you and your
[39:20.940 --> 39:25.780]  entire family's heads off go research it they'd line them up mawpaw everybody
[39:25.780 --> 39:32.060]  with a Tommy good and just kill you yeah that's the kind of country we live in
[39:32.060 --> 39:36.420]  that's what you do by making liquor illegal three times the alcohol okay
[39:36.420 --> 39:41.260]  I'm preaching here three times the alcohol use go research it don't believe
[39:41.260 --> 39:44.620]  me go look the numbers under prohibition under nine and a half years of it
[39:44.620 --> 39:49.180]  totally corrupted the police corrupted all organized crime exploded and then at
[39:49.180 --> 39:51.460]  the end of that they said we got to make drugs illegal we got to have something
[39:51.460 --> 39:57.820]  new here all right we've got that look at this u.s. agents launder drug money
[39:57.820 --> 40:03.620]  report see it's all coming out then in the federal court cases forever but
[40:03.620 --> 40:09.460]  it's coming out feds may give loans to IMF to help eurozone paper they've been
[40:09.460 --> 40:13.420]  giving their subsidiary banks in Europe see that whole headline on a Reuters is
[40:13.420 --> 40:20.180]  a headline it's not the Fed it's not federal the name is a lie may give loans
[40:20.180 --> 40:25.780]  to the IMF it's not loans it's zero or minus interest loans which they then
[40:25.780 --> 40:31.540]  loaned out at 20 30 40% to governments and individuals to help eurozone and the
[40:31.540 --> 40:34.820]  other lies they've already been giving it to them and they're not giving it to
[40:34.820 --> 40:37.900]  somebody else they're giving it to themselves I mean how many lies can you
[40:37.900 --> 40:42.020]  get in a headline one two three four five there is least six lies in that
[40:42.020 --> 40:48.900]  headline talk about a tissue a fabric of fraud this is what we live under and the
[40:48.900 --> 40:52.980]  average person is helpless at that level of deception how do you unravel
[40:52.980 --> 40:58.180]  something that is a complete lie they're already doing it the Federal Reserve is
[40:58.180 --> 41:09.540]  at federal it's giving it to its own subsidiary and it just goes on and on
[41:10.740 --> 41:14.820]  look at this article I knew what was going to happen last week whenever it
[41:14.820 --> 41:18.100]  came out that the 85 year old woman in a wheelchair was taken behind closed doors
[41:18.100 --> 41:22.420]  and strip searched had her clothes taken off I knew they would come out and say
[41:22.420 --> 41:26.820]  it wasn't true and they did then when press they said we don't call it a strip
[41:26.820 --> 41:32.020]  search see when they grab your genitals or they take you behind closed doors and
[41:32.020 --> 41:38.500]  strip you down it's not sexual assault it's not a strip search and low and
[41:38.500 --> 41:44.420]  behold Lenora Zimmerman outrages TSA denies it stripped search 85 year old
[41:44.420 --> 41:50.020]  Long Island grandmother and there's another one here where other women
[41:50.020 --> 41:53.220]  another elderly woman says she was exposed at the same airport
[41:53.220 --> 41:59.860]  Canada Airport where I had him by the way Rob Rob something out of my bag I bought
[41:59.860 --> 42:06.980]  a couple little Tiffany things for my middle daughter and they they just
[42:06.980 --> 42:12.020]  opened up the packages and stole one of them only worth about 80 90 bucks but
[42:12.020 --> 42:16.420]  they stole it I mean that's how mirror and you know I do not even say anything
[42:16.420 --> 42:19.700]  because I'm a scum citizen and if they want to steal
[42:19.700 --> 42:24.420]  a Tiffany silver teething ring good for the babies that chew on silver it's why
[42:24.420 --> 42:29.620]  I got it if they want to do that that's that's just a little added goody good

[42:51.140 --> 42:55.060]  years ago that the West blows stuff up every week in Iran
[42:55.060 --> 42:58.660]  it's all admitted it's just not on the news that's now being admitted

[43:31.620 --> 43:37.060]  hello Alexine by the way it's the Soviet Socialist Republic of Illinois
[43:37.460 --> 43:40.900]  anyway that's what we call it um so I'm a 20 secure
[43:40.900 --> 43:44.420]  vet police officer I'm not going to tell you where
[43:44.420 --> 43:48.740]  but I guess it doesn't really matter but it's central Illinois
[43:48.740 --> 43:51.540]  it was up to us who wouldn't have Chicago in the state
[43:51.540 --> 43:55.700]  but it's not up to us uh long story short we've got a
[43:55.700 --> 44:00.740]  a bunch of guys that and uh we've got like a phone
[44:00.740 --> 44:04.260]  chain by some chance one of us is at the station and or
[44:04.260 --> 44:08.260]  let's say I'm at the station we get the guy in the suit comes in and says you're
[44:08.260 --> 44:12.580]  going to do this that and the other one phone call for me
[44:12.580 --> 44:16.420]  generates probably about 35 phone calls in about 30 seconds
[44:16.420 --> 44:23.460]  you know and as far as firearms are concerned
[44:23.460 --> 44:27.140]  if you're going to buy them learn to use them it's going to do you a bit of
[44:27.140 --> 44:30.820]  good to have a pistol set in their rifle or whatever
[44:30.820 --> 44:34.820]  um is all that's going to do is get you in trouble
[44:34.820 --> 44:39.140]  I agree with you let me ask you a question uh Dale again a police officer from
[44:39.140 --> 44:43.140]  Illinois is anybody that you're talking to
[44:43.140 --> 44:46.500]  concerned about them saying we're going to use the military we're going to put
[44:46.500 --> 44:48.980]  TSA on the streets they're now doing it we're going to have
[44:48.980 --> 44:52.020]  telescreens everywhere saying spy on your neighbors it's like they went and
[44:52.020 --> 44:55.540]  got a dystopic science fiction movie and said let's make it reality
[44:55.540 --> 44:58.820]  it's like 1984 on steroids and we're going to allow citizens
[44:58.820 --> 45:03.780]  to disappear into black holes have police realized that once that starts
[45:03.780 --> 45:07.780]  it doesn't give people any recourse but to
[45:07.780 --> 45:11.860]  absolutely resist I mean to police or police realizing
[45:11.860 --> 45:16.820]  how the globalists are trying to escalate a civil war on purpose
[45:16.820 --> 45:19.860]  people guys do younger guys have got no clue
[45:19.860 --> 45:24.340]  um and that I have a lot I don't know if
[45:24.340 --> 45:28.420]  you know it's generational I'm almost uh well I'm
[45:28.420 --> 45:32.420]  beyond I'm 60 years old and uh I've seen a lot
[45:32.420 --> 45:36.980]  and uh the younger kids we're trying to educate them
[45:36.980 --> 45:40.020]  we're we're from what I've seen we've been making some ground
[45:40.020 --> 45:42.660]  matter of fact I had a rookie in the other day and I sat him down in this
[45:42.660 --> 45:47.300]  day I said if uh the blow shows up at the station
[45:47.300 --> 45:50.260]  the suit and the chief brings his sentences we're going to go down this
[45:50.260 --> 45:53.540]  block and we're going to do a checklist and see who
[45:53.540 --> 45:56.740]  who has firearms so on and so forth what are you going to do
[45:56.740 --> 46:00.020]  and he says I'm not going to do it that's so good
[46:00.020 --> 46:04.260]  you know and uh the other kid the thing is you don't even have to tell them no
[46:04.260 --> 46:07.300]  unless you want to you can just go and say nobody
[46:07.300 --> 46:11.460]  everybody was gone or my car broke down I mean you don't
[46:11.460 --> 46:15.700]  again you just don't have to follow unconstitutional orders
[46:15.700 --> 46:19.860]  I agree with you but it's time for this guy the guys in the blue and the brown
[46:19.860 --> 46:23.460]  and you know because our deputies were brown but uh the blue and the brown
[46:23.460 --> 46:27.460]  and the khaki green that the state police were started
[46:27.460 --> 46:30.900]  standing up and telling the feds not only no but hell no we've got a tenth
[46:30.900 --> 46:34.740]  amendment to the state or in this united state supposedly
[46:34.740 --> 46:38.180]  it says we do have states rights but that's been trounced on so bad that
[46:38.180 --> 46:41.620]  it's ridiculous but in fact it's been trounced on right now so bad
[46:41.620 --> 46:46.740]  it was like it was prior to the civil war oh it is I mean they've they've gotten
[46:46.740 --> 46:50.740]  in fact it was Illinois where we got the documents and had with his voice
[46:50.740 --> 46:56.260]  disguised a uh in the town he's in it it wasn't called a mayor
[46:56.260 --> 47:00.180]  what's a the head's select man wherever you call it we had him on
[47:00.180 --> 47:04.980]  and the feds came in and said you have to armor the police station
[47:04.980 --> 47:08.900]  and you have to get ready because the veterans will attack you with
[47:08.900 --> 47:13.060]  improvised explosive devices and it is coming and the flu's coming and will
[47:13.060 --> 47:17.380]  kill millions and Chicago will implode and and the point is
[47:17.380 --> 47:20.660]  is that they're just trying to get the police ready for war with the people
[47:20.660 --> 47:25.300]  have you had similar attempted brainwashing go on in your area
[47:25.300 --> 47:29.060]  um well they tried but we're downstate is a little bit different
[47:29.060 --> 47:33.460]  than it is in the chicago area but they've tried now after 9-11 we hardened
[47:33.460 --> 47:39.460]  the station um that that did happen um and they did that all over the
[47:39.460 --> 47:42.420]  place and put the the blockades in front of the
[47:42.420 --> 47:44.660]  station so it was so you couldn't drive a car to it
[47:44.660 --> 47:48.420]  stuff but their big their big fear is is not so much
[47:48.420 --> 47:52.500]  that and they they're trying to twist it a little bit Alex the bit their big
[47:52.500 --> 47:56.020]  fear is that when the the state and or the federal
[47:56.020 --> 48:00.340]  governments were broke and you're not going to get your state age your food
[48:00.340 --> 48:05.060]  stamps on and so forth a major riot starting and it escalated no no but
[48:05.060 --> 48:08.420]  that's true and the banksters engineer it and then
[48:08.420 --> 48:12.420]  I'll even be in Austin begging for the military if a group of people are
[48:12.420 --> 48:15.940]  coming towards me burning things but again that won't happen here because we
[48:15.940 --> 48:19.860]  have guns where it is going to happen in Chicago New York and LA
[48:19.860 --> 48:26.260]  I mean those are places to get out of yeah um I do have I do have a comment
[48:26.260 --> 48:31.380]  for you though really thinking about it um the day you run into trouble you

[48:42.980 --> 48:46.500]  we have to remember why the media shows all the police brutality videos and
[48:46.500 --> 48:50.020]  everything because they're trying to turn us all against each other
[48:50.020 --> 48:53.220]  and they're trying to hold up corrupt police as the example
[48:53.220 --> 48:56.420]  so that we can have a war with each other we do not
[48:56.420 --> 49:01.140]  need to do this and that's putting it lightly okay who's up next here

[49:16.820 --> 49:21.220]  oh I'm pretty upset everything's unfolding like we thought it would
[49:21.220 --> 49:24.980]  well I enjoy your radio program been listening for about a year I called in
[49:24.980 --> 49:27.540]  several months ago and talked to you in length
[49:27.540 --> 49:32.020]  enjoyed our conversation but I want to make a point I uh spent uh
[49:32.020 --> 49:36.340]  time with a buddy of mine that's a uh officer in the Marine Corps
[49:36.340 --> 49:40.340]  and I uh we were having dinner and I said hey uh
[49:40.340 --> 49:46.660]  if the United States government wants the Second Amendment pulled and they're
[49:46.660 --> 49:52.180]  going to start taking guns away and are you guys willing to do it and he said
[49:52.180 --> 49:55.940]  yeah we're ordered to do we're going to do it and I said well what if Americans
[49:55.940 --> 50:00.420]  tried to defend themselves and he says well hey if they're
[50:00.420 --> 50:03.460]  going to shoot at us you know it's about the buddy next to us
[50:03.460 --> 50:07.540]  you know we're going to take care of business I said well I said what is your
[50:07.540 --> 50:10.580]  opinion on uh you know doing police actions in
[50:10.580 --> 50:13.140]  law enforcement because well we're already trained for he says I think it's
[50:13.140 --> 50:16.500]  actually a good idea and I said well you know what I said there's
[50:16.500 --> 50:20.900]  clearly a separation between police and military I said
[50:20.900 --> 50:23.780]  you know when you guys clear a building you guys throw in a couple grenades and
[50:23.780 --> 50:27.060]  go in take care of business I said well we we we don't we don't
[50:27.060 --> 50:31.460]  look at the building search the same way and it's the same way with police work

[53:57.060 --> 54:12.980]  let's go berkey.com today
[54:13.620 --> 54:17.540]  we're talking to mark and we're gonna go to uh adam
[54:17.540 --> 54:22.180]  military man and another mark uh who are military
[54:22.180 --> 54:25.620]  but uh listen i've got a lot of family in the military
[54:25.620 --> 54:28.740]  and i've got a lot of other contacts and we've been to the drills i've got the
[54:28.740 --> 54:32.420]  footage the marines especially i hear some
[54:32.420 --> 54:35.540]  marines calling and say we'll never do it and i've been to the drills where they
[54:35.540 --> 54:40.260]  trained to kill americans and admit it and i mean unarmed americans
[54:40.260 --> 54:43.540]  and let's all be honest the marines are sent overseas and kill everybody in
[54:43.540 --> 54:46.660]  villages they go into i mean every once in a while they
[54:46.660 --> 54:50.820]  prosecute people for a massacre or something if the marines rape some 15
[54:50.820 --> 54:53.780]  year old girl and then kill them they go to prison for it but if
[54:53.780 --> 54:56.980]  they just kill everybody then they get a medal for it
[54:56.980 --> 55:01.460]  i mean let let that's come out in the news so it's kind of a schizophrenic type
[55:01.460 --> 55:04.660]  deal when it comes out they get in trouble
[55:04.660 --> 55:09.700]  but you cannot criticize the germans with this attitude because they said hey
[55:09.700 --> 55:13.540]  i'm ordered to take guns and arrest people i'm gonna do it and that's what
[55:13.540 --> 55:17.700]  they did release the military on the germans and the countries they invaded
[55:17.700 --> 55:22.420]  uh it's 101 for north korea every other dictatorship every other corrupt
[55:22.420 --> 55:26.260]  system and i tell you mark i tell you i'm gonna be
[55:26.260 --> 55:29.620]  honest with you if i had a friend like that saying i'll take guns i'll kill
[55:29.620 --> 55:33.940]  americans that's not the type of friend i want just because
[55:33.940 --> 55:37.220]  mark when the time comes you it probably come to your house and kill you if
[55:37.220 --> 55:42.980]  somebody told him to i mean it is a type of moral cowardice
[55:42.980 --> 55:47.300]  that really makes me sick perhaps your friend mark is also very ignorant
[55:47.300 --> 55:51.380]  we were all once dumb as dirt but i can't imagine being an officer in the
[55:51.380 --> 55:55.380]  marine corps who's sworn an oath the bill of rights constitution the military
[55:55.380 --> 55:59.380]  code because i know it's still taught even just a few years ago that you're
[55:59.380 --> 56:04.340]  not supposed to do that uh go ahead and finish up mark i appreciate you calling
[56:04.340 --> 56:07.620]  no he's highly educated he's got a master's degree but
[56:07.620 --> 56:11.700]  it it would be it have to be in a situation like
[56:11.700 --> 56:16.100]  you know uh some kind of terrorist attack or something like that
[56:16.100 --> 56:19.140]  you know that we talked about isn't there's going to go in and kick doors and
[56:19.140 --> 56:22.100]  take people's guns but i want to make another point
[56:22.100 --> 56:26.500]  i'm pro military my friend and i have been friends for a long time we've gone to
[56:26.500 --> 56:31.220]  college together um but the point i want to make is
[56:31.220 --> 56:35.380]  it makes sense that the that the congress and
[56:35.380 --> 56:39.620]  and senate want to get this bill passed to have the military on the streets
[56:39.620 --> 56:44.340]  because they know that seasoned police officers like myself
[56:44.340 --> 56:50.340]  are not going to violate people's rights and we are not going to put the boots
[56:50.340 --> 56:53.700]  to american citizens so it makes sense for them
[56:53.700 --> 57:00.020]  to have military personnel especially um hiring young police officers who've
[57:00.020 --> 57:03.700]  just come out of military who have had over combat hard
[57:03.700 --> 57:08.580]  look these guys uh don't have a problem taking care of business we had a
[57:08.580 --> 57:12.980]  shooting in a town several months ago and a guy came out with a gun and
[57:12.980 --> 57:17.620]  and they took care of business but one of the officers that was put on uh
[57:17.620 --> 57:20.580]  administrative leave because that's normal when we go in involved in
[57:20.580 --> 57:23.460]  police shooting they didn't understand why he had to be
[57:23.460 --> 57:27.220]  taken off the street for three weeks because in iraq when
[57:27.220 --> 57:31.060]  they're at war and they kill somebody they move on and he
[57:31.060 --> 57:34.420]  he wanted to get back to work and those are the kind of people
[57:34.420 --> 57:38.580]  that police departments in bigger cities are hiring because exactly we got
[57:38.580 --> 57:42.580]  internal memos in texas where they said don't let anybody know this but
[57:42.580 --> 57:47.540]  we're only hiring state police now who are former combat vets
[57:47.540 --> 57:50.900]  the younger the better this is an internal memo we we published it
[57:50.900 --> 57:54.420]  that a report on it a few months ago which is discriminatory
[57:54.420 --> 57:58.660]  but but again military kills people breaks things occupies
[57:58.660 --> 58:01.860]  and that's what's so incredibly off the charts
[58:01.860 --> 58:08.660]  and uh they you're absolutely right plus they don't understand
[58:08.660 --> 58:14.500]  that how how illegal this is so it's crazy uh so and of course they're
[58:14.500 --> 58:18.020]  going to give your friend some psi-op reason this is being done you're
[58:18.020 --> 58:22.420]  absolutely right amazing call anything else you need to add mark
[58:22.420 --> 58:26.420]  i just want to say that listen that people need to understand the majority of
[58:26.420 --> 58:29.940]  police in this country we're decent i'd say well this is too important stay
[58:29.940 --> 58:33.220]  there well one minute break we're going to come back and then i promise
[58:33.220 --> 58:37.220]  i'm going to get to adam military man mark and others but mark in washington
[58:37.220 --> 58:43.060]  state stay there
[58:43.060 --> 58:50.420]  this is gcn the genesis communications radio network
[58:50.420 --> 58:54.500]  a very wealthy u.s citizen is predicting that in 2011
[58:54.500 --> 58:58.580]  we will witness the most important day in america in more than 50 years
[58:58.580 --> 59:02.340]  he says it will change everything about our lives the way you shop travel
[59:02.340 --> 59:05.780]  invest educate your children and even how you take care of your health and your
[59:05.780 --> 59:08.180]  own family now this man has made some outrageous
[59:08.180 --> 59:11.860]  predictions over the years the crazy part is he's usually right
[59:11.860 --> 59:15.940]  you see he predicted the collapse of gm bannie may friday mac and america's
[59:15.940 --> 59:19.860]  biggest mall owner general growth properties in fact barons called his
[59:19.860 --> 59:23.460]  work a dire prophecy recently he created a video which you can
[59:23.460 --> 59:26.820]  watch online for free detailing his biggest and most important prediction
[59:26.820 --> 59:30.580]  yet and it's a real eye-opener i can't stress this enough you should
[59:30.580 --> 59:34.180]  at least watch this free video online today he explains everything you need to
[59:34.180 --> 59:37.140]  know including simple steps you can take to protect yourself
[59:37.140 --> 59:42.900]  you can find the video at www.endofamerica3.com that's end of america

[59:52.020 --> 01:00:05.060]  waging war on corruption alex jones on the gcm radio network
[01:00:05.060 --> 01:00:09.860]  big brother mainstream media government cover-ups
[01:00:09.860 --> 01:00:17.140]  you want answers well so does he he's alex jones on the gcm radio network
[01:00:17.140 --> 01:00:22.420]  and now live from austin texas alex jones
[01:00:22.420 --> 01:00:26.980]  look having laws on the books when obama signs this
[01:00:26.980 --> 01:00:30.660]  obama says he may not he says he has the executive power to do without congress
[01:00:30.660 --> 01:00:35.140]  so it's even more treasonous if that's possible like a cherry on top
[01:00:35.140 --> 01:00:38.660]  with the national defense authorization act 2012
[01:00:38.660 --> 01:00:42.580]  when they say we'll arrest you secretly you'll never be seen again we can kill
[01:00:42.580 --> 01:00:45.700]  you that takes it to another level where war
[01:00:45.700 --> 01:00:49.540]  is declared illegal war that's against the laws of war
[01:00:49.540 --> 01:00:55.300]  uh in in in all of modern history when criminal foreign banks take over who
[01:00:55.300 --> 01:01:00.500]  are on record laundering money on record dealing the drugs
[01:01:00.500 --> 01:01:04.500]  at that point it's just it's publicly illegitimate there's
[01:01:04.500 --> 01:01:07.860]  no doubt about it now finishing up with police officer in washington state
[01:01:07.860 --> 01:01:12.580]  mark uh were you able to get through to your
[01:01:12.580 --> 01:01:17.620]  friend uh were you able to wake him up this marine
[01:01:17.620 --> 01:01:21.380]  corps officer he went to college with about the fact that
[01:01:21.380 --> 01:01:25.700]  following illegal unconstitutional orders i mean what about his oath
[01:01:25.700 --> 01:01:28.420]  what about keeping his oath and then you had a point you were trying to finish
[01:01:28.420 --> 01:01:30.900]  making mark
[01:01:31.380 --> 01:01:35.220]  no i mean i like i said my friend's highly educated and he's
[01:01:35.220 --> 01:01:38.820]  he's a think but uh you know orders are orders
[01:01:38.820 --> 01:01:42.900]  that's basically where we left it at i explained to him my situation and
[01:01:42.900 --> 01:01:46.180]  and you know and i think what i wanted to say is the american people need to
[01:01:46.180 --> 01:01:49.300]  understand that uh and i hope they believe that
[01:01:49.300 --> 01:01:53.220]  the most police officers are decent we're doing our job
[01:01:53.220 --> 01:01:56.820]  and listen the feds know they need our help because listen they come into my
[01:01:56.820 --> 01:02:01.700]  community and they want you know joe q citizen arrested because you know he
[01:02:01.700 --> 01:02:04.100]  spoke out at a rally or something well he's on his own
[01:02:04.100 --> 01:02:06.820]  he's gonna go have to get help somewhere else because he's not gonna get
[01:02:06.820 --> 01:02:09.380]  it from me well that's why they're putting that's why
[01:02:09.380 --> 01:02:12.500]  they're putting cia and the threat fusion centers
[01:02:12.500 --> 01:02:15.860]  they're they're you know federally deputizing as a sub deputy
[01:02:15.860 --> 01:02:19.540]  that's why they're trying to federalize right now uh how is that process going
[01:02:19.540 --> 01:02:24.500]  into washington state right now see in my area uh we have a good
[01:02:24.500 --> 01:02:28.420]  relationship with the feds i mean the guys on the ground they're just like us
[01:02:28.420 --> 01:02:32.020]  these common sense i don't see the federalization i see kind of the
[01:02:32.020 --> 01:02:36.420]  unification uh of counties you know uh
[01:02:36.420 --> 01:02:39.860]  smaller departments are getting absorbed and going to sheriff's office you know
[01:02:39.860 --> 01:02:43.460]  they're bringing the the dispatch centers you know may
[01:02:43.460 --> 01:02:47.380]  will just have one dispatch center for the whole county that you see stuff like
[01:02:47.380 --> 01:02:50.500]  that and they're but they're unifying the codes which
[01:02:50.500 --> 01:02:54.100]  sounds reasonable to go under homeland security codes but you want your own
[01:02:54.100 --> 01:02:59.860]  local codes you don't want to be we have jurisdictions for a reason
[01:02:59.860 --> 01:03:04.340]  well i i agree with you i mean uh at least in my area right now and plus
[01:03:04.340 --> 01:03:08.500]  washington state i mean if you want to a state to live in where they
[01:03:08.500 --> 01:03:11.700]  go up you know honor the rights and probably give
[01:03:11.700 --> 01:03:16.260]  a lot more leeway to criminals and just the regular system this is the place to
[01:03:16.260 --> 01:03:19.140]  live i mean this is one of the most toughest areas
[01:03:19.140 --> 01:03:22.740]  to be a police officer and because we have so many more rules than
[01:03:22.740 --> 01:03:27.540]  other states i mean for instance when i if we have a traffic stop and the
[01:03:27.540 --> 01:03:31.060]  passengers got a seatbelt on we can't even talk to that person
[01:03:31.060 --> 01:03:33.940]  i mean they can get out of the car and walk away and there's nothing we can do
[01:03:33.940 --> 01:03:37.060]  you know in california they can arrest somebody for being listen i know that's
[01:03:37.060 --> 01:03:41.140]  a hassle but it's just like uh the uh you know
[01:03:41.140 --> 01:03:45.460]  clements deal uh where the baseball player on the steroids got off because
[01:03:45.460 --> 01:03:49.460]  the feds showed here say to the jury the judge let
[01:03:49.460 --> 01:03:52.660]  him go because it's better that 10 guilty people go
[01:03:52.660 --> 01:03:56.500]  free than one one innocent person go to jail
[01:03:56.500 --> 01:04:02.180]  and justice and liberty is is is a is a messy thing but it's a lot better
[01:04:02.180 --> 01:04:07.780]  than north korea uh mark and and it's i mean do you agree with that statement
[01:04:07.780 --> 01:04:10.740]  yeah i agree but listen we're we're dealing with the same people all the
[01:04:10.740 --> 01:04:15.060]  time so if they get away with something we're gonna get them again and that's
[01:04:15.060 --> 01:04:17.780]  and i think that's the american people need to understand
[01:04:17.780 --> 01:04:21.460]  we're dealing with the the bottom 10 percent of society
[01:04:21.460 --> 01:04:25.540]  90 percent of americans awesome people love talking to them
[01:04:25.540 --> 01:04:29.220]  don't have an issue with them it we're doing we're dealing with the same people
[01:04:29.220 --> 01:04:33.620]  over and over again and really the the biggest problem in the criminal justice
[01:04:33.620 --> 01:04:37.700]  system is not the police it it's it's the uh
[01:04:37.700 --> 01:04:42.580]  it's the court system it's a joke no i agree they release the violent offenders
[01:04:42.580 --> 01:04:46.740]  and put the non-violence in there and it's all by plan they want the criminals
[01:04:46.740 --> 01:04:50.580]  out there harassing everybody as a pretext for more control great

[01:08:05.940 --> 01:08:09.940]  because there's a war on for your mind
[01:08:30.260 --> 01:08:34.260]  all right my friends here we are back in the saddle again
[01:08:34.260 --> 01:08:38.420]  incredible developments taking place in our world
[01:08:38.420 --> 01:08:43.620]  it is 1208 central standard time blasting out here on the am and fm dial
[01:08:43.620 --> 01:08:47.780]  global shortwave and of course the internet at info wars
[01:08:47.780 --> 01:08:52.340]  dot com that i mentioned xm radio as well channel
[01:08:52.340 --> 01:08:58.260]  166 okay let me just mention some of the news then i'm
[01:08:58.260 --> 01:09:02.100]  going to take four or five more calls from police and military
[01:09:02.100 --> 01:09:06.180]  that are calling in giving us their take on the unbelievable
[01:09:06.180 --> 01:09:13.140]  national defense authorization act and i wrote some notes about this act last
[01:09:13.140 --> 01:09:16.340]  night whenever i was going on coast to coast a m with
[01:09:16.340 --> 01:09:21.780]  rob simone uh they're filling host there this is the end of posse common
[01:09:21.780 --> 01:09:24.740]  taught us the 1878 law barring the military from
[01:09:24.740 --> 01:09:28.100]  engaging in domestic operations remember all the years we told you they were
[01:09:28.100 --> 01:09:32.020]  getting rid of this behind the scenes oh conspiracy theory now it's here
[01:09:32.020 --> 01:09:35.380]  it allows the secret arrest indefinite detention no charges
[01:09:35.380 --> 01:09:39.620]  torture and killing of american citizens the white house put memos out
[01:09:39.620 --> 01:09:43.780]  last monday saying we can even kill people okay so that's beyond north korea
[01:09:43.780 --> 01:09:47.620]  i mean this is just pure evil
[01:09:48.500 --> 01:09:52.420]  and the game plan is you notice this is all happening as the world economy is
[01:09:52.420 --> 01:09:55.300]  imploded and the police are being told prepare for total
[01:09:55.300 --> 01:10:00.100]  collapse which was engineered by the banksters the very ones calling for a new
[01:10:00.100 --> 01:10:03.940]  world order the same things being done in europe right now
[01:10:03.940 --> 01:10:07.060]  but it doesn't just declare us the enemy and allow the military to operate here
[01:10:07.060 --> 01:10:12.020]  it's worldwide it's a declaration of war against laws
[01:10:12.020 --> 01:10:14.740]  against due process against countries worldwide
[01:10:14.740 --> 01:10:19.540]  it's the u.s military which is not the u.s military it is the occupied
[01:10:19.540 --> 01:10:25.380]  captured forces of the banksters literally of course the american military
[01:10:25.380 --> 01:10:28.580]  doesn't fight its own citizens of course they don't train to take guns
[01:10:28.580 --> 01:10:33.140]  of course they don't kill citizens of course they don't do these things it's
[01:10:33.140 --> 01:10:36.500]  not our military the german military was not the
[01:10:36.500 --> 01:10:40.020]  german military under hitler but the germans still went along with it because
[01:10:40.020 --> 01:10:43.540]  it looked like their military their military follow the orders
[01:10:43.540 --> 01:10:47.860]  you we're going to go to adam we're going to go to a
[01:10:47.860 --> 01:10:52.260]  military man mark a z killed here in just a moment
[01:10:52.260 --> 01:10:56.180]  we've got the tsa i told you years ago would have checkpoints on the highways
[01:10:56.180 --> 01:11:00.900]  because i watched their meetings on c span now they're doing it
[01:11:00.900 --> 01:11:05.140]  ten men i've seen these newscasts we're in tennessee and california other areas
[01:11:05.140 --> 01:11:08.900]  you pull up at just a random checkpoint on a major highway
[01:11:08.900 --> 01:11:12.660]  and boy those state police have got their marine corps you know drill sergeant
[01:11:12.660 --> 01:11:15.700]  hats on they've got their hands and fists shaken
[01:11:15.700 --> 01:11:18.820]  they're looking at the little kids and the moms they're pulling it out of there
[01:11:18.820 --> 01:11:24.500]  i'm searching you i mean they are really getting ready for war against us
[01:11:24.500 --> 01:11:28.900]  and and i hope the police military realize if one percent fights back against
[01:11:28.900 --> 01:11:32.340]  this if you actually start arresting people who are on political pickup list
[01:11:32.340 --> 01:11:35.460]  the word will get out even if you shut the web off
[01:11:35.460 --> 01:11:38.500]  and when you when and when people pull up to these things
[01:11:38.500 --> 01:11:41.780]  it's not cowardice that's held the american people back it's
[01:11:41.780 --> 01:11:49.620]  it's incredible restraint but once the guns are pulled out of their holsters
[01:11:49.780 --> 01:11:52.980]  i mean do you have any idea what's going to happen to you
[01:11:52.980 --> 01:11:56.820]  if you try to run checkpoints and arrest people and stuff as you're trained for
[01:11:56.820 --> 01:12:00.420]  and look the bankers are going to give you the order you're like well it's crazy
[01:12:00.420 --> 01:12:04.500]  it'll be an absolute civil war that's the plan
[01:12:04.500 --> 01:12:07.700]  order out of chaos they don't care how many citizens get killed
[01:12:07.700 --> 01:12:11.620]  they don't care how many police and military get killed they like it
[01:12:11.620 --> 01:12:16.740]  they are publicly under n le09 cooperative nugget type these names in
[01:12:16.740 --> 01:12:19.940]  you'll see the video the drills the fema press releases
[01:12:19.940 --> 01:12:25.220]  have 15 countries ready to invade the us you're like that'll never happen here
[01:12:25.220 --> 01:12:30.980]  really really cross human animal clones that never happen
[01:12:30.980 --> 01:12:34.580]  foster children having chemicals biological tested on them radiological
[01:12:34.580 --> 01:12:38.180]  never happened government run health care never happened
[01:12:38.180 --> 01:12:42.260]  obama as the head of the un never gonna happen all these wars and lies
[01:12:42.260 --> 01:12:45.380]  and cameras on street corners and microphones hidden in trees never
[01:12:45.380 --> 01:12:50.180]  gonna happen all happened all happened
[01:12:50.180 --> 01:12:54.180]  police taking blood at checkpoints not gonna happen happened
[01:12:54.180 --> 01:12:57.460]  nazi germany wasn't gonna happen happened soviet russia wasn't gonna
[01:12:57.460 --> 01:13:01.620]  happen happen all folks tyranny is the norm and
[01:13:01.620 --> 01:13:05.060]  again it's going to happen because the globalist
[01:13:05.060 --> 01:13:09.620]  are public about all this it's all public that's how i know what's coming
[01:13:09.620 --> 01:13:12.180]  next that's how i made all these films it's how i've
[01:13:12.180 --> 01:13:15.940]  inaccurate because i'm just a regular guy from texas
[01:13:15.940 --> 01:13:20.260]  who happened to run across all this decades ago and got upset about it
[01:13:20.260 --> 01:13:24.740]  it's a normal response to learn about this and to take action
[01:13:24.740 --> 01:13:28.420]  and i'm not going to sit here and say it's the federal government it's too big
[01:13:28.420 --> 01:13:33.060]  we can't beat this it's illegitimate they're on record laundering 500
[01:13:33.060 --> 01:13:35.860]  billion a year in drug money the government's on record shipping the
[01:13:35.860 --> 01:13:40.260]  drugs in every major federal agency is run
[01:13:40.260 --> 01:13:45.460]  by criminals the good news is there's still a lot of good people in the
[01:13:45.460 --> 01:13:48.180]  stratus so that's why you keep seeing these people get busted
[01:13:48.180 --> 01:13:51.460]  how many deputy heads of homeland security have been caught with children
[01:13:51.460 --> 01:13:54.980]  pedophiles or caught in the new bestiality scandal
[01:13:54.980 --> 01:13:59.540]  with with kids and stuff involved uh at uh the cdc
[01:13:59.540 --> 01:14:03.700]  who do you think they can get at the top who will do stuff like this
[01:14:03.700 --> 01:14:09.700]  crazy sickos stalin and hitler both opened up the prisons
[01:14:09.700 --> 01:14:14.740]  and hired all the aggravated felons on record
[01:14:14.740 --> 01:14:18.100]  what do you think the system's done they have found the bad apples
[01:14:18.100 --> 01:14:22.340]  and they're putting them at the head of every power structure
[01:14:22.500 --> 01:14:24.500]  i'm going to say it again and then i'm going to cover some more news to go to
[01:14:24.500 --> 01:14:26.900]  your calls
[01:14:27.860 --> 01:14:31.940]  we learned earlier this year bloomberg and ap that and it was just reported
[01:14:31.940 --> 01:14:34.740]  like it was no big deal and didn't get any national attention
[01:14:34.740 --> 01:14:39.060]  that prudential and a whole bunch of other big mega insurance companies
[01:14:39.060 --> 01:14:43.700]  in 1999 met with the pentagon and the
[01:14:43.700 --> 01:14:48.500]  veterans affairs office and made a deal to allow them
[01:14:48.500 --> 01:14:51.940]  to take the death benefits of world war two vets
[01:14:51.940 --> 01:14:55.780]  right through to current vets at the time and and and on
[01:14:55.780 --> 01:14:59.380]  where they send you paperwork that tricks you the government approved this
[01:14:59.380 --> 01:15:03.940]  to say sign here and get your money but then it's got some legalese that you
[01:15:03.940 --> 01:15:09.060]  can't understand and then they take your money
[01:15:09.060 --> 01:15:13.620]  i mean these are criminal isn't the word it's just a word
[01:15:13.620 --> 01:15:18.420]  it's it's it's it's unlimited evil
[01:15:18.420 --> 01:15:21.300]  and when humans start bowing down to authority
[01:15:21.300 --> 01:15:25.300]  just because it's in a suit and just because it's on tv and just because it
[01:15:25.300 --> 01:15:29.220]  it reads well off a teleprompter that's when you get
[01:15:29.220 --> 01:15:34.020]  disaster and it's here i haven't even gotten into iranian i haven't even
[01:15:34.020 --> 01:15:41.220]  gotten into the economy yet it is so fundamental
[01:15:41.220 --> 01:15:44.660]  when they say posse commentatus is gone we're going to use the military against
[01:15:44.660 --> 01:15:47.700]  the american people anybody else we want worldwide and by the way we'll
[01:15:47.700 --> 01:15:52.020]  secretly arrest you with no charge you can disappear into a black hole
[01:15:52.020 --> 01:15:56.500]  i mean that is that is worse than i even thought they would do in the next step
[01:15:56.500 --> 01:16:00.100]  they're going for everything because the globalists have set up a ponzi scheme
[01:16:00.100 --> 01:16:06.100]  1.5 quadrillion 1,500 trillion of fake counterfeit money
[01:16:06.100 --> 01:16:09.460]  they put their people in over every major government of the world
[01:16:09.460 --> 01:16:12.660]  while they're running their previous scams and now they're taking the whole
[01:16:12.660 --> 01:16:16.100]  world down and announcing we'll have a world depression
[01:16:16.100 --> 01:16:20.420]  if you don't make the six megabanks and the fellow reserve owners of the planet
[01:16:20.420 --> 01:16:23.380]  we're going to shut everything off they're holding us hostage they got a gun to
[01:16:23.380 --> 01:16:27.860]  our head an economic gun and they and they're backed up by paramilitary police
[01:16:27.860 --> 01:16:31.780]  and military the video games the dramas the
[01:16:31.780 --> 01:16:34.500]  brainwashing it's all about fighting the american people
[01:16:34.500 --> 01:16:39.620]  the training manuals all of it boy scouts training to take on veterans
[01:16:39.620 --> 01:16:42.500]  you're like well they're 14 year olds yeah that was three years ago
[01:16:42.500 --> 01:16:46.900]  they're now 17 the point is it's right out of a movie
[01:16:46.900 --> 01:16:50.820]  they got the government youth they got the domestic security forces they've
[01:16:50.820 --> 01:16:54.740]  got the checkpoints being set up they've got the neighbors being trained to spy
[01:16:54.740 --> 01:16:57.940]  and a lot of people are not cowards folks a lot of people
[01:16:57.940 --> 01:17:02.180]  are going to go to that point where they can't back off anymore and and and
[01:17:02.180 --> 01:17:06.580]  then i'm trying to stop this from happening
[01:17:06.580 --> 01:17:10.260]  okay folks i've told you everything's going to happen so far
[01:17:10.260 --> 01:17:13.300]  let me tell you something this is what's going to happen
[01:17:13.300 --> 01:17:16.900]  lawlessness is going to happen the police are going to be forced to march out
[01:17:16.900 --> 01:17:19.940]  the military against the citizens the citizens are going to start fighting
[01:17:19.940 --> 01:17:23.540]  back and it's not going to be pretty so the public doesn't join with the
[01:17:23.540 --> 01:17:27.780]  citizens they're going to commit a bunch of atrocities black ops will
[01:17:27.780 --> 01:17:32.420]  foreign operatives and others horrible atrocities that'll be pinned on
[01:17:32.420 --> 01:17:35.540]  true americans what you'll call what they'll call
[01:17:35.540 --> 01:17:39.060]  you know the the right wing terrorist and
[01:17:39.060 --> 01:17:42.340]  it's going to be police and their armored compounds law and order breaking
[01:17:42.340 --> 01:17:46.820]  down uh and they're just going to let
[01:17:46.820 --> 01:17:52.100]  america basically fall apart that is seriously being considered
[01:17:52.100 --> 01:17:57.300]  and or the elite is insane because it's not going to go the way they think it
[01:17:57.300 --> 01:18:02.180]  is i can't tell you how many veterans of vietnam
[01:18:02.180 --> 01:18:06.580]  even korea that are still alive uh some world war two but mainly korea vietnam
[01:18:06.580 --> 01:18:11.300]  and then current veterans and and people who if you cut their
[01:18:11.300 --> 01:18:13.940]  pension fund that they're guaranteed to get they're going to start shooting
[01:18:13.940 --> 01:18:17.860]  people okay
[01:18:18.740 --> 01:18:23.940]  i mean this will give a new meaning to the word going postal
[01:18:23.940 --> 01:18:27.540]  there are a lot of people that don't care about dying ladies and gentlemen
[01:18:27.540 --> 01:18:30.980]  there are a lot of people who don't want to go out and kill people either
[01:18:30.980 --> 01:18:34.580]  but if they are forced to it's not going to be pretty
[01:18:34.580 --> 01:18:37.860]  look when the good guys start killing people it's never pretty
[01:18:37.860 --> 01:18:41.540]  do you understand that the good guys will stomp you bad guys
[01:18:41.540 --> 01:18:44.980]  absolutely into the dirt and i hope you bad guys understand that
[01:18:44.980 --> 01:18:48.820]  i think you do deep down that's why you're so scared of the good guys

[01:24:34.820 --> 01:24:38.180]  adam in michigan and others then i'm gonna get to the news and believe me
[01:24:38.180 --> 01:24:40.900]  it's powerful adam who's a police officer in
[01:24:40.900 --> 01:24:43.540]  michigan uh what do you say about uh what we've been
[01:24:43.540 --> 01:24:48.660]  covering here today uh alex you're fabulous uh i've been a
[01:24:48.660 --> 01:24:53.140]  police officer here in michigan for 12 years 90 that time was spent on
[01:24:53.140 --> 01:24:57.220]  michigan's largest department i'm in another large department now i've been
[01:24:57.220 --> 01:25:02.660]  here for a year um by all means i plan on upholding the constitution
[01:25:02.660 --> 01:25:07.220]  defending it it's just amazing i i've uh
[01:25:07.220 --> 01:25:10.740]  listened to your show for a long time about eight years now maybe longer
[01:25:10.740 --> 01:25:14.900]  first-time caller you know a lot of the public sees us
[01:25:14.900 --> 01:25:19.540]  as sees public safety of people police fire military as heroes
[01:25:19.540 --> 01:25:22.580]  and i know you hate to hear it but a lot of us think you're a hero as well and
[01:25:22.580 --> 01:25:26.500]  your crew so thanks for what you guys do well thank you and that's what's sad
[01:25:26.500 --> 01:25:30.340]  about there are a lot of heroes who are in public safety it's just
[01:25:30.340 --> 01:25:33.780]  the people running it at the top are definitely bad
[01:25:33.780 --> 01:25:36.740]  and so that's why it all comes down to the moral
[01:25:36.740 --> 01:25:40.980]  and spiritual decision of who you're going to serve
[01:25:40.980 --> 01:25:45.700]  absolutely i'm constantly talking to police officers about all of this
[01:25:45.700 --> 01:25:48.500]  information that you've given me thank you again
[01:25:48.500 --> 01:25:52.340]  always talking about you know the bottom line is uphold the constitution
[01:25:52.340 --> 01:25:56.020]  defend the constitution no matter what happens no matter what they tell us
[01:25:56.020 --> 01:26:00.820]  we took the oath i took it that serious defend the constitution against
[01:26:00.820 --> 01:26:04.500]  enemies born in domestic period in the story that's what i tell them
[01:26:04.500 --> 01:26:07.300]  let me ask you a question you're on you know the second largest or one of the
[01:26:07.300 --> 01:26:10.260]  other big forces there obviously you're on the detroit before that
[01:26:10.260 --> 01:26:13.300]  let me ask you this question it's now coming out the government did ship the
[01:26:13.300 --> 01:26:16.580]  guns into mexico that the feds are shipping in drugs
[01:26:16.580 --> 01:26:20.660]  it's back in the news today are any of the police talking about that or any of
[01:26:20.660 --> 01:26:26.100]  the police seeing the tsa groping grandmothers i mean
[01:26:26.100 --> 01:26:30.180]  i mean because look i've covered what was going to happen others have said
[01:26:30.180 --> 01:26:33.780]  what's going to happen now it's happening i mean is the patriot movement
[01:26:33.780 --> 01:26:37.780]  that's been so demonized is it getting any more credibility with police or
[01:26:37.780 --> 01:26:42.020]  what's the mindset right now i don't i don't i don't hear a lot of guys talking
[01:26:42.020 --> 01:26:44.020]  about it unless i bring it up and then it gets
[01:26:44.020 --> 01:26:47.460]  then we get into a big discussion about it so i don't i really don't hear a lot
[01:26:47.460 --> 01:26:52.180]  about it but on a positive note we did go through some training recently here
[01:26:52.180 --> 01:26:55.620]  uh talking about the open carry of the firearm
[01:26:55.620 --> 01:26:59.140]  and um i couldn't believe that they were actually telling us as long as it's
[01:26:59.140 --> 01:27:02.180]  visible we have no right to talk to them we have
[01:27:02.180 --> 01:27:05.300]  no probable cause of stopping talking about anything as long as they're
[01:27:05.300 --> 01:27:07.940]  holding carrying the gun outside and we can see it
[01:27:07.940 --> 01:27:12.260]  that's their right how do you have just energized the key to everything here
[01:27:12.260 --> 01:27:16.020]  people five years ago thought it was insane when folks did open carry
[01:27:16.020 --> 01:27:20.180]  but it right that's not exercise is lost police all over the country flipped
[01:27:20.180 --> 01:27:23.460]  out then they and the public the media flipped out
[01:27:23.460 --> 01:27:28.180]  hardball and all those people slime ball wanted to act like guns were illegal
[01:27:28.180 --> 01:27:32.180]  even in your house were 12 years ago or 13 years ago i had the carpet cleaner
[01:27:32.180 --> 01:27:35.620]  call the cops on me because i had a gun case with shotguns in it
[01:27:35.620 --> 01:27:39.300]  and he watched dramas based in new york where guns are illegal
[01:27:39.300 --> 01:27:42.900]  or he tried to call the cops they stopped him and explained no it's legal

[01:38:31.620 --> 01:38:37.780]  hey i'll tell you doing good hey i'm a former
[01:38:37.780 --> 01:38:41.540]  active duty currently serving reservist here i just want to speak to my fellow
[01:38:41.540 --> 01:38:44.980]  brothers and arms here that took you back up a little mark said a second ago
[01:38:44.980 --> 01:38:48.980]  that uh we took an oath to defend and that means if need be giving up your
[01:38:48.980 --> 01:38:53.380]  life for the ideals of the constitution and the second part of that is that we
[01:38:53.380 --> 01:38:57.220]  swear that uh
[01:39:00.180 --> 01:39:03.620]  don't help me god and that means that one day
[01:39:03.620 --> 01:39:07.780]  if you violate that you're going to have to answer before our creator
[01:39:07.780 --> 01:39:13.460]  that you're not just breaking you know our ideals our laws our rules uh
[01:39:13.460 --> 01:39:16.820]  these are presented by god because he has our creator
[01:39:16.820 --> 01:39:21.380]  well oaths are a big thing and i mean when you swear an oath it's it's it's
[01:39:21.380 --> 01:39:27.060]  big medicine you know as the witch doctors would say uh and
[01:39:27.060 --> 01:39:31.300]  but i mean if you just look at history look at the crooks in washington
[01:39:31.300 --> 01:39:35.220]  they have a nine percent approval rating in congress
[01:39:35.220 --> 01:39:39.380]  why would any police officer or military person
[01:39:39.380 --> 01:39:43.700]  do things that they know is unconstitutional for a bunch of crooks
[01:39:43.700 --> 01:39:48.020]  a bunch of scum do you see what i'm saying military man absolutely
[01:39:48.020 --> 01:39:52.340]  yes sir i do absolutely and uh for us to choose a side you can't be sitting on
[01:39:52.340 --> 01:39:56.020]  the sidelines you know the bible says you cannot be luke warm you can only
[01:39:56.020 --> 01:40:00.740]  choose a side and the bible also says if he is for us who can be against us
[01:40:00.740 --> 01:40:05.940]  so i think we have a absolutely uh a strong chance of overthrowing these
[01:40:05.940 --> 01:40:09.300]  people and uh taking care of business for what we need to
[01:40:09.300 --> 01:40:12.740]  try to take a stand and it's not like we're just being taken over by some

[01:40:17.460 --> 01:40:20.820]  that they want to forcibly reduce world population these are the nastiest

[01:40:50.340 --> 01:40:54.100]  property without due process i mean it's a lot of stuff
[01:40:54.100 --> 01:40:59.540]  that's going on and look they're putting chemicals in the water that increase
[01:40:59.540 --> 01:41:04.580]  cancer uh that addle the mind i mean i don't just
[01:41:04.580 --> 01:41:07.860]  get up here and say that most fluoride manufacturers
[01:41:07.860 --> 01:41:11.300]  because it's the it's the leftover toxic waste from three different industries
[01:41:11.300 --> 01:41:14.980]  fertilizer nuclear and aluminum they don't just dump
[01:41:14.980 --> 01:41:18.180]  sodium fluoride in your water that increases cancer and all the rest of it
[01:41:18.180 --> 01:41:21.700]  they add radioactive isotopes that are mined out of the same phosphate
[01:41:21.700 --> 01:41:25.300]  mines i mean and i've been saying this for years now it's finally the news
[01:41:25.300 --> 01:41:29.460]  news goes with its geiger counters to the city pipes and goes wow it's 20 times
[01:41:29.460 --> 01:41:33.380]  what it should be and then the feds go we don't know why that's there and they
[01:41:33.380 --> 01:41:37.300]  have all these investigative reports going gee golly is it in the water
[01:41:37.300 --> 01:41:42.340]  aquifers no it's added to the water
[01:41:42.340 --> 01:41:45.220]  technically because it's out of the same limestone aquifers they mine these
[01:41:45.220 --> 01:41:49.700]  phosphates there's sometimes some radon some uranium some
[01:41:49.700 --> 01:41:54.180]  but but but this is added
[01:41:54.180 --> 01:41:57.940]  we again people come to face to face with reality and they're like that can't
[01:41:57.940 --> 01:42:01.620]  be true go look it up the people running our
[01:42:01.620 --> 01:42:05.620]  society put radioactive isotopes in the water
[01:42:05.620 --> 01:42:10.420]  these are sickos because if you were healthy and had your testosterone level
[01:42:10.420 --> 01:42:13.380]  or your estrogen level at the right level if you're a woman i mean i've seen
[01:42:13.380 --> 01:42:17.700]  the numbers over 35 percent of women above the age of 30 now
[01:42:17.700 --> 01:42:24.500]  have thyroid disorders women's hair is falling out everywhere
[01:42:24.500 --> 01:42:28.180]  it's because of the fluoride and other things are put in the water
[01:42:28.180 --> 01:42:33.220]  diabetes cancer all this stuff there's a reason even if you work out and eat
[01:42:33.220 --> 01:42:36.900]  healthy almost if you're going to have problems folks
[01:42:39.300 --> 01:42:42.260]  see a lot of cops in military think they're going to choose a side well i'll
[01:42:42.260 --> 01:42:45.140]  go with the new world order i'll get some power and i'll be safe
[01:42:45.140 --> 01:42:48.980]  you can't join it see that's the thing that's the trick of the devil
[01:42:48.980 --> 01:42:51.220]  even if you don't believe in the devil let's just say you know evil in the
[01:42:51.220 --> 01:42:54.660]  world is that you think you choose it there's it's all
[01:42:54.660 --> 01:42:57.380]  really a a fraud in fact george norrie told a
[01:42:57.380 --> 01:43:00.100]  story when i was all with him a month ago and so i'm gonna
[01:43:00.100 --> 01:43:07.620]  butcher it right here a um politician dies and he goes up to
[01:43:07.620 --> 01:43:13.300]  heaven and he goes up to the golden gate and saint michael or
[01:43:13.300 --> 01:43:16.260]  whoever it is is there at the gate i'm gonna butcher the story
[01:43:16.260 --> 01:43:20.740]  and the politician goes up and he says oh great i i i get to get into heaven
[01:43:20.740 --> 01:43:23.540]  and he brings them on in and st michael says now wait a minute
[01:43:23.540 --> 01:43:27.700]  you're gonna get to make a choice here you're gonna get to elect
[01:43:27.700 --> 01:43:30.980]  if you want to go to heaven or hell first i want you to take this elevator
[01:43:30.980 --> 01:43:36.340]  down to hell and come back and then tell me
[01:43:36.340 --> 01:43:40.580]  where you want to go and really this is a metaphor for life
[01:43:40.580 --> 01:43:43.940]  and the the politician who's uh gone to heaven
[01:43:43.940 --> 01:43:46.340]  says well let me look around here a little bit and he sees people sitting
[01:43:46.340 --> 01:43:50.980]  around on the clouds uh playing harps and stuff he says no i
[01:43:50.980 --> 01:43:53.860]  want to stay here and he goes nope i'm gonna send you to check it he goes
[01:43:53.860 --> 01:43:57.780]  all right all right i guess so so he goes down the elevator
[01:43:57.780 --> 01:44:00.740]  opens up there's the devil in a tuxedo beautiful women
[01:44:00.740 --> 01:44:05.380]  drinking martinis jazz band playing everything's great
[01:44:05.380 --> 01:44:07.780]  he says wow this is what hell's like and he goes oh yeah i don't believe
[01:44:07.780 --> 01:44:10.340]  everything you're told yeah and he goes i'm gonna go back up telling my
[01:44:10.340 --> 01:44:12.580]  choice he goes back up sees people playing harps
[01:44:12.580 --> 01:44:15.780]  sitting on clouds you know just sitting around talking he goes i've made my
[01:44:15.780 --> 01:44:22.260]  decision i'm glad you told me to go check i i want to go to hell
[01:44:22.260 --> 01:44:26.580]  and so the politician goes back down the elevator opens back up
[01:44:26.580 --> 01:44:29.300]  devil grabs him throws him in a big pot of lava
[01:44:29.300 --> 01:44:32.420]  to be tortured forever and he says but it was wonderful it was great you said
[01:44:32.420 --> 01:44:35.380]  that this is what hell was like and the devil looks at him and says that was
[01:44:35.380 --> 01:44:42.260]  before the election he elected you all elect and
[01:44:42.260 --> 01:44:45.780]  again even if you don't believe in god what comes around goes around when you
[01:44:45.780 --> 01:44:48.260]  have a society where nobody cares about anybody else and
[01:44:48.260 --> 01:44:51.380]  people will go along with anything and i'll shoot anybody if the government
[01:44:51.380 --> 01:44:55.780]  says i'll confiscate guns if they say i mean you you talk about that 15 16 years
[01:44:55.780 --> 01:44:58.580]  ago you get calls saying you're nuts that'll never happen
[01:44:58.580 --> 01:45:02.100]  now we're having to have discussions about well some military says they will
[01:45:02.100 --> 01:45:07.060]  and the government's getting ready for it see what we've become
[01:45:07.060 --> 01:45:11.460]  by successive approximation by incremental moves
[01:45:11.460 --> 01:45:16.980]  this is what we become and it's just going to get crazier from here on out
[01:45:16.980 --> 01:45:22.500]  because it's true that you start changing the country one person at a time
[01:45:22.500 --> 01:45:26.740]  the public has degenerated the family has degenerated i mean i was a carpet
[01:45:26.740 --> 01:45:30.020]  cleaner for one summer folks i've been in a bunch of houses let me tell you it
[01:45:30.020 --> 01:45:34.420]  didn't pretty i've seen a snapshot of what police
[01:45:34.420 --> 01:45:37.700]  see and that's what they see the public has because that's all they see is the
[01:45:37.700 --> 01:45:40.500]  bottom of the barrel
[01:45:43.700 --> 01:45:47.700]  we are a country going into judgment
[01:45:48.660 --> 01:45:51.780]  all right let's go to uh
[01:45:52.340 --> 01:45:55.780]  mark who's military in oklahoma mark thanks for holding you're on the air
[01:45:55.780 --> 01:45:59.540]  worldwide hi i like uh like your joke
[01:45:59.540 --> 01:46:03.860]  i really appreciate that one um in oklahoma army national guard in the
[01:46:03.860 --> 01:46:07.780]  45th infantry brigade and uh i'm about to tell you that i don't
[01:46:07.780 --> 01:46:12.180]  really think a lot of the military personnel are probably going to resist
[01:46:12.180 --> 01:46:17.300]  as much as everybody might say they will uh we were deployed in iraq in 2007
[01:46:17.300 --> 01:46:21.380]  and you know we did a lot of things that
[01:46:21.380 --> 01:46:24.660]  you can probably imagine isn't very moral but uh
[01:46:24.660 --> 01:46:28.180]  we get home around night you know chatting and stuff and most of them
[01:46:28.180 --> 01:46:32.340]  barely seem to have no regrets what was happened and
[01:46:32.340 --> 01:46:36.580]  you know confiscating weapons or you know arresting people
[01:46:36.580 --> 01:46:39.860]  whatever we were doing um they didn't seem to mind it very much
[01:46:39.860 --> 01:46:43.940]  yeah yeah they've even got body scanners now and they biometrically
[01:46:43.940 --> 01:46:47.060]  scan people shaking down families grabbing kids
[01:46:47.060 --> 01:46:52.500]  giving them to the cps of iraq that that's basically what you did right
[01:46:52.500 --> 01:46:56.260]  we didn't have uh those kind of machines we just did the old-fashioned
[01:46:56.260 --> 01:46:59.540]  checkpoints of what we used and uh
[01:46:59.540 --> 01:47:02.740]  yeah we unfortunately we did a lot of things that i don't really want to
[01:47:02.740 --> 01:47:04.420]  discuss you know just things that were
[01:47:04.420 --> 01:47:07.460]  immoral and had to make my peace with god about it but
[01:47:07.460 --> 01:47:11.300]  did you just go really go into houses and just throw hang grenades into
[01:47:11.300 --> 01:47:14.500]  houses with families and stuff like that
[01:47:14.500 --> 01:47:18.100]  well bang grenades first and then that didn't do the trick then we'd finish
[01:47:18.100 --> 01:47:22.580]  them off but yeah fortunately you know so that kind of did something i mean
[01:47:22.580 --> 01:47:28.020]  did i mean did that get you closer to god though seeing dead kids
[01:47:28.740 --> 01:47:33.540]  unfortunately yeah i wish did not come to that route i wish it had been
[01:47:33.540 --> 01:47:36.900]  a much better thing that did happen what kind of switch did that throw in you
[01:47:36.900 --> 01:47:38.900]  forever because i think i heard a child in the background
[01:47:38.900 --> 01:47:42.900]  do you think about those kids every time you look at your children
[01:47:42.900 --> 01:47:47.140]  absolutely alex absolutely every day and you know the worst part of it is
[01:47:47.140 --> 01:47:50.100]  you get back and the guys don't even seem to care
[01:47:50.100 --> 01:47:54.420]  go back to your unit and sit there at a night playing cards or whatever else we
[01:47:54.420 --> 01:47:58.260]  were doing playing nintendo whatever didn't seem to matter most of them just
[01:47:58.260 --> 01:48:01.540]  blew it off like it was nothing you know mark you better thank god
[01:48:01.540 --> 01:48:06.100]  you better thank god for that pain you've got you know why you've got pain
[01:48:06.100 --> 01:48:09.700]  that's because you've got a soul and a conscience and you've got your guardian
[01:48:09.700 --> 01:48:12.660]  angel my friend that's what you're feeling and
[01:48:12.660 --> 01:48:17.060]  those people that don't feel something heaven help them
[01:48:17.060 --> 01:48:20.900]  please continue well and
[01:48:20.900 --> 01:48:24.260]  you know that's something i had to live with for a while now but
[01:48:24.260 --> 01:48:27.060]  you know the other guys you know they don't seem to have a lot of compassion
[01:48:27.060 --> 01:48:30.260]  about that stuff you know there's some that did but the officers just thought
[01:48:30.260 --> 01:48:33.700]  of it as routine you know and we all do ten and over there that just thought it
[01:48:33.700 --> 01:48:36.900]  was funny you know he he did take pictures with his cell phone that's
[01:48:36.900 --> 01:48:39.780]  what he would do and i don't know what he would do with the
[01:48:39.780 --> 01:48:43.220]  pictures who knows but that's one thing he would do is take pictures with his
[01:48:43.220 --> 01:48:47.780]  cell phone with it you know he thought it was funny
[01:48:47.780 --> 01:48:51.860]  yeah it's just it's sad but i don't think when push comes to show here that
[01:48:51.860 --> 01:48:56.020]  some of them are going to resist no doubt but majority alex i really don't
[01:48:56.020 --> 01:48:59.460]  think it's going to happen now they're going to try to publicize how patriots
[01:48:59.460 --> 01:49:01.860]  are routed when the military takes them out but
[01:49:01.860 --> 01:49:05.540]  you understand the rule of attrition can you just as a military person give me
[01:49:05.540 --> 01:49:08.900]  your view if one percent of a hundred and fifty million gun
[01:49:08.900 --> 01:49:11.780]  owners decide to go out and just walk into a
[01:49:11.780 --> 01:49:14.820]  coffee shop or somebody in their backyard
[01:49:14.820 --> 01:49:17.940]  because it's not like the public's just going to sit there and line up like with
[01:49:17.940 --> 01:49:20.980]  the redcoats that i mean if a million five hundred
[01:49:20.980 --> 01:49:25.060]  thousand combatants decide to go out and bag one military person
[01:49:25.060 --> 01:49:29.220]  what's going to happen we'd be gone
[01:49:29.220 --> 01:49:33.060]  second yeah because not only are there more of
[01:49:33.060 --> 01:49:36.020]  everybody else in us but you have to figure they know where we live they know
[01:49:36.020 --> 01:49:39.060]  where we work yeah i mean i hope the people that
[01:49:39.060 --> 01:49:41.860]  are going to follow these orders realize what they're releasing
[01:49:41.860 --> 01:49:47.940]  i mean they're releasing absolute hell i mean and again the globalist think
[01:49:47.940 --> 01:49:51.060]  everybody's cowards like them they think all these vets and people
[01:49:51.060 --> 01:49:54.420]  haven't attacked yet because they're cowards it's the opposite
[01:49:54.420 --> 01:49:57.940]  they don't understand they just have no idea
[01:49:57.940 --> 01:50:03.620]  and and again i want to avert this but
[01:50:03.620 --> 01:50:06.660]  and i'm not saying you guys didn't face a lot in iraq but from talking a lot of
[01:50:06.660 --> 01:50:10.420]  veterans a bunch of disheveled poor malnutrition
[01:50:10.420 --> 01:50:16.500]  iraqis it's it's not going to be like that here in the united states
[01:50:16.500 --> 01:50:19.940]  well even the gangs here are better organized than the little thugs over
[01:50:19.940 --> 01:50:23.060]  there you know i guess i should even call them thugs really they're
[01:50:23.060 --> 01:50:26.820]  defending their their own property i guess but
[01:50:26.820 --> 01:50:31.940]  but you know we were to face ms-13 or something like that here i really don't
[01:50:31.940 --> 01:50:35.460]  think there'd be much of a chance because we may have better arms but you know we
[01:50:35.460 --> 01:50:38.500]  don't have that mentality i want to stick there and
[01:50:38.500 --> 01:50:41.620]  fight it out to the end you know we're not defending our home here
[01:50:41.620 --> 01:50:46.260]  if we're keep doors and stealing guns it's amazing
[01:50:46.260 --> 01:50:49.380]  absolutely the mexican military can't stand up against the drug gangs
[01:50:49.380 --> 01:50:52.740]  look when people are ready to die you can't stop them
[01:50:52.740 --> 01:50:55.700]  and the thing is the globalists are starting fights with people
[01:50:55.700 --> 01:51:00.660]  that don't have a choice god bless you my friend more calls straight ahead
[01:51:00.660 --> 01:51:04.100]  did you know nuclear radiation is still spewing out of the melted down
[01:51:04.100 --> 01:51:07.700]  reactors in fukushima japan and making its way across the entire
[01:51:07.700 --> 01:51:11.060]  us continent contaminating the air water and food

[01:55:28.660 --> 01:55:32.020]  give the tales now they've said it's not a strip search it's the
[01:55:32.020 --> 01:55:35.460]  procedure that's like shooting someone in the
[01:55:35.460 --> 01:55:39.940]  head and saying i'm not shooting you in the head it's a procedure
[01:55:39.940 --> 01:55:44.180]  or i'm going to chop your head off it's not a murder it's surgery

[01:58:11.700 --> 01:58:15.380]  paul's number two still can't win because they said so because they tell
[01:58:15.380 --> 01:58:18.580]  you what can happen they tell you when the tsa sticks their
[01:58:18.580 --> 01:58:20.900]  hands down your wife's pants or grabs her breasts

[02:01:39.620 --> 02:01:42.340]  younger generation who needs to be woken up the most
[02:01:42.340 --> 02:01:46.340]  these kids truly are the children of babelon i tried to teach you about gmo's
[02:01:46.340 --> 02:01:49.940]  and organic agriculture or self-sufficiency self-reliance
[02:01:49.940 --> 02:01:54.180]  and you know they laugh and scoff at me and they have no concept of freedom or
[02:01:54.180 --> 02:01:57.140]  liberty all they know is materialism garbage pop
[02:01:57.140 --> 02:02:00.260]  culture mindless video games and chemical abuse
[02:02:00.260 --> 02:02:04.580]  on this cohort is who needs woken up the most they enlist because they want to
[02:02:04.580 --> 02:02:10.020]  live out the fantasies that they've been first manifested on their xbox 360
[02:02:10.020 --> 02:02:13.700]  you're right and they like to beat up old people that's a big phenomenon
[02:02:13.700 --> 02:02:18.260]  just the ab we we have degenerated and haven't helped us with this next i mean
[02:02:18.260 --> 02:02:23.380]  it's really bad uh you're right uh so as a marine what's your view on
[02:02:23.380 --> 02:02:27.060]  on this announcement that uh that basically the constitution was flushed
[02:02:27.060 --> 02:02:32.420]  down the toilet well it looks like the nail in the coffin to me
[02:02:32.420 --> 02:02:36.420]  um if they're able to implement it if they're able to implement it
[02:02:36.420 --> 02:02:40.740]  right um i you know i really love to talk i got so much i love to talk to you
[02:02:40.740 --> 02:02:44.180]  about because i've been inside four facets of the system i've been inside
[02:02:44.180 --> 02:02:48.100]  the military industrial complex i've been inside the educational system
[02:02:48.100 --> 02:02:51.620]  i've been inside the prison industrial complex and i've been inside what i call
[02:02:51.620 --> 02:02:55.940]  the esoteric industrial complex um and i've seen some stuff that
[02:02:55.940 --> 02:02:59.940]  you know that's invisible to a lot of people but there's there's one okay well
[02:02:59.940 --> 02:03:04.500]  you got the floor for two minutes hit it go okay well actually what i want to
[02:03:04.500 --> 02:03:09.060]  make one point this uh i want to call out the tea party and ows these
[02:03:09.060 --> 02:03:12.580]  movements need to stand up and reject the two-party dictatorship
[02:03:12.580 --> 02:03:16.100]  because i went to a tea party rally and i've also been to ows and i got
[02:03:16.100 --> 02:03:18.900]  frustrated the tea party needs to reject the republicans
[02:03:18.900 --> 02:03:23.140]  ows needs to reject the democrats i would love to see ron paul team up with
[02:03:23.140 --> 02:03:26.660]  somebody like cusinage to show that that people who love freedom whether
[02:03:26.660 --> 02:03:29.620]  they are progressive or conservative libertarians
[02:03:29.620 --> 02:03:33.940]  can abandon squabbles of theoretical ideology and unite against the machine
[02:03:33.940 --> 02:03:38.580]  we need a coalition to rise up in 2012 you can't dismiss such a united
[02:03:38.580 --> 02:03:44.660]  coalition as a waste voting spoiler well said well said give us give us
[02:03:44.660 --> 02:03:49.780]  30 seconds on the military industrial complex and then tell us about the esoteric
[02:03:49.780 --> 02:03:54.820]  um there's one other point i want to get to you i'm sorry it's kind of digressed
[02:03:54.820 --> 02:03:58.260]  it's uh i i just would like to you to make a distinction because i think
[02:03:58.260 --> 02:04:02.340]  sometimes you kind of alienate people who misinterpret what you say about
[02:04:02.340 --> 02:04:05.700]  collectivism um there's state collectivism and there's libertarian
[02:04:05.700 --> 02:04:10.340]  collectivism and an almas community or a buddhist or catholic no no no people
[02:04:10.340 --> 02:04:14.340]  get together and decide to collectivize that works really good of it small
[02:04:14.340 --> 02:04:18.020]  uh and works really well small as beautiful there's a book on that
[02:04:18.020 --> 02:04:23.060]  it it's it's it's command and control collectivism is the plague
[02:04:23.060 --> 02:04:28.740]  right and you know eco village or the family or you know ritual aid and
[02:04:28.740 --> 02:04:32.980]  um charity that's that's real collectivism well the globalist always
[02:04:32.980 --> 02:04:36.420]  counterfeit what's normal that's why people get into collectivism

[02:09:11.620 --> 02:09:15.300]  accelerated we'll also get into what's happening with the economy
[02:09:15.300 --> 02:09:19.860]  but bruce fine it joins us he's a lawyer who specializes in constitutional

[02:09:46.180 --> 02:09:49.140]  and he joins us now to talk about the state of the union
[02:09:49.140 --> 02:09:51.220]  you know going back when he was on with this i don't know four or five months
[02:09:51.220 --> 02:09:55.940]  ago we talked about obama launching military operations and saying
[02:09:55.940 --> 02:10:00.500]  he didn't need congress to do that that he quote did it for the
[02:10:00.500 --> 02:10:03.940]  credibility of the un i mean what a slap in the face what treason
[02:10:03.940 --> 02:10:07.380]  that he became the head of the security council violating article one section
[02:10:07.380 --> 02:10:11.060]  nine flaunting it the news even admitted that
[02:10:11.060 --> 02:10:15.060]  now we enter a new phase and obama says he'll veto the
[02:10:15.060 --> 02:10:18.580]  sections of the national defense authorization act where the military
[02:10:18.580 --> 02:10:22.820]  can arrest us citizens the whole world's a declaration of war against the
[02:10:22.820 --> 02:10:27.140]  world kill anybody anywhere including north com here in the u.s
[02:10:27.140 --> 02:10:31.380]  so all of that's in there but obama came out and said i i may not sign it
[02:10:31.380 --> 02:10:35.060]  because i'm the president and i have that authority to kill
[02:10:35.060 --> 02:10:38.660]  citizens outside of law or courts or anything
[02:10:38.660 --> 02:10:41.700]  anywhere in the world so i don't need congress so
[02:10:41.700 --> 02:10:46.900]  the media tried to spend his oh obama's for the bill of rights constitution
[02:10:46.900 --> 02:10:49.700]  no the press releases lawyers put out last week
[02:10:49.700 --> 02:10:52.820]  we covered it here said something entirely different
[02:10:52.820 --> 02:10:55.860]  we'll get bruce finds a breakdown on this and get his take on
[02:10:55.860 --> 02:10:59.140]  the ron paul campaign bruce thanks for coming on with us today well thank you
[02:10:59.140 --> 02:11:01.860]  for inviting me while things are really accelerating
[02:11:01.860 --> 02:11:06.260]  were you shocked by this legislation and give us your expert take on it and
[02:11:06.260 --> 02:11:09.940]  where this takes us yes and i want to take it from
[02:11:09.940 --> 02:11:13.620]  how we interpret the president's threat to veto
[02:11:13.620 --> 02:11:18.180]  this is before the legislation uh was passed by the congress
[02:11:18.180 --> 02:11:22.420]  the president claimed as you indicated authority unilaterally
[02:11:22.420 --> 02:11:27.460]  to fascinate any american anywhere in the world on his face so alone based upon
[02:11:27.460 --> 02:11:32.340]  secret facts secret laws saying so-and-so is an imminent danger to the
[02:11:32.340 --> 02:11:35.380]  security of the united states you don't have to be on a battlefield you don't
[02:11:35.380 --> 02:11:38.740]  have to be involved in hostilities you don't even have to be accused of a
[02:11:38.740 --> 02:11:41.620]  crime because mr awakie had never been indicted he'd
[02:11:41.620 --> 02:11:45.060]  never been subject to any even formal arrest warrant anything like that and
[02:11:45.060 --> 02:11:48.820]  neither was this sixteen-year-old kid who was vaporized a few days later
[02:11:48.820 --> 02:11:52.580]  i mean this is this is a power that would have made king george the third
[02:11:52.580 --> 02:11:55.460]  jealous and we overthrew king george the third this is a
[02:11:55.460 --> 02:11:59.860]  a power that every tyrant would crave and celebrate i can kill any of my
[02:11:59.860 --> 02:12:03.140]  citizens anytime i want based on secret facts
[02:12:03.140 --> 02:12:06.420]  and secret law and on the imminent danger i mean he'd been on the list
[02:12:06.420 --> 02:12:10.100]  awakie for over a year and the imminent danger i mean imminent
[02:12:10.100 --> 02:12:13.940]  means it's going to happen immediately it shows the orwellian use of language
[02:12:13.940 --> 02:12:16.660]  by the obama administration that's before
[02:12:16.660 --> 02:12:20.420]  he also claimed the absolute authority to decide on his own
[02:12:20.420 --> 02:12:24.420]  whether if he did capture an american citizen or a non-citizen in the united
[02:12:24.420 --> 02:12:27.380]  states based upon some suspicion that he said
[02:12:27.380 --> 02:12:30.740]  there's shows involvement in international terrorism
[02:12:30.740 --> 02:12:36.180]  he could decide on his whim i'll try you in a civilian court and prosecute you
[02:12:36.180 --> 02:12:40.180]  or i'll try you in a military court military commissions and prosecute you
[02:12:40.180 --> 02:12:44.180]  i can just flip one way or the other and you can't constrain me
[02:12:44.180 --> 02:12:46.580]  what he did that that was before the legislation
[02:12:46.580 --> 02:12:49.620]  so what he objected to in the legislation wasn't
[02:12:49.620 --> 02:12:53.620]  the idea that that that any no president should have this omnipotent
[02:12:53.620 --> 02:12:57.700]  authority he was furious that congress thought it had
[02:12:57.700 --> 02:13:00.100]  any faith to try to constrain him in any way
[02:13:00.100 --> 02:13:03.620]  because congress was trying to limit his ability to flip detainees from the
[02:13:03.620 --> 02:13:06.980]  military system disabilities so he wasn't defending civil
[02:13:06.980 --> 02:13:10.820]  liberty he was destroying the last vestige of checks
[02:13:10.820 --> 02:13:14.980]  and balances and separation of powers by saying congress you have no authority
[02:13:14.980 --> 02:13:19.300]  to try to limit me in any way i want whenever i claim i'm fighting a war
[02:13:19.300 --> 02:13:23.220]  i am i am the law you know it's like louisa 14th of the state
[02:13:23.220 --> 02:13:26.740]  somewhat it's me i know the president instead of
[02:13:26.740 --> 02:13:31.460]  understanding that thinks now he's become an aclu civil libertarian by
[02:13:31.460 --> 02:13:36.340]  being talking to legislate incredible that that's what's so amazing
[02:13:36.340 --> 02:13:39.940]  he's saying no because you're trying to follow the constitution even though this
[02:13:39.940 --> 02:13:43.460]  is unconstitutional the way you're trying to pass it's constitutional
[02:13:43.460 --> 02:13:47.460]  right i'm not going and his lawyers said that and the media
[02:13:47.460 --> 02:13:50.980]  went along with this bruce do you think it's because they are ignorant or
[02:13:50.980 --> 02:13:56.420]  because they want to protect him well i think um it's a combination
[02:13:56.420 --> 02:14:01.060]  several of them think i think truly are just totally ignorant
[02:14:01.060 --> 02:14:04.820]  um but others clearly they want to
[02:14:04.820 --> 02:14:08.420]  um they they they do not like congress
[02:14:08.420 --> 02:14:14.260]  um and this is a way in which they can try to paint congress that do nothing
[02:14:14.260 --> 02:14:18.740]  congress whatever that um but that's in part here it's not
[02:14:18.740 --> 02:14:22.340]  do nothing congress they they do not like the tea party uh
[02:14:22.340 --> 02:14:26.020]  conservative slant in the congress although this is the opposite of that
[02:14:26.020 --> 02:14:30.740]  uh and so this is just another chance to slam the congress of the united states
[02:14:30.740 --> 02:14:34.500]  that certainly when they see something that isn't
[02:14:34.500 --> 02:14:39.060]  that that's like obama uh but a lot of it is just lavishness
[02:14:39.060 --> 02:14:43.380]  the president and i think also it's it's unfortunate that it's not limited to
[02:14:43.380 --> 02:14:46.660]  obama i think the president general has become cheerleaders
[02:14:46.660 --> 02:14:51.700]  for kings and queens for omnipotence in the executive branch and assailing
[02:14:51.700 --> 02:14:55.860]  any suggestion that self-government really also have any sway because after
[02:14:55.860 --> 02:14:59.220]  all these platonic guardians in the white house in the oval office to tell us
[02:14:59.220 --> 02:15:02.660]  how to live you know whether we should have spinach or broccoli and
[02:15:02.660 --> 02:15:05.700]  and rules and regulations that congress never touches yet
[02:15:05.700 --> 02:15:11.380]  have enormous consequences for the economy it's a it is a very very arrogant
[02:15:11.380 --> 02:15:15.460]  condescending attitude of government the precise attitude
[02:15:15.460 --> 02:15:20.900]  that provoked the american revolution in 1776 i mean the founding fathers if they
[02:15:20.900 --> 02:15:24.420]  saw this piece of legislation the president starting that power they
[02:15:24.420 --> 02:15:28.580]  would impeach the president in less than 24 hours
[02:15:28.580 --> 02:15:33.300]  bruce obviously the system knows that the derivatives the too big to fails the
[02:15:33.300 --> 02:15:38.260]  crony capitalism is coming down and we're seeing an acceleration of
[02:15:38.260 --> 02:15:41.380]  agendas uh that that you and i and ron paul and many
[02:15:41.380 --> 02:15:45.700]  others had warned about been laughed at now people aren't laughing uh i mean
[02:15:45.700 --> 02:15:48.740]  does it have to get really bad before it gets better where where do you expect
[02:15:48.740 --> 02:15:52.020]  this to go i mean do you expect uh them to be able to
[02:15:52.020 --> 02:15:55.540]  implement stuff like this i mean i mean this does tell us a lot about
[02:15:55.540 --> 02:15:59.780]  the the makeup of our government that that they're attempting things like
[02:15:59.780 --> 02:16:02.820]  this well it does and it also is the most
[02:16:02.820 --> 02:16:07.540]  dangerous element here is what's become gravely a subtext of our national
[02:16:07.540 --> 02:16:12.100]  discourse a risk-free society we can anything that anybody says will make a
[02:16:12.100 --> 02:16:15.060]  safer is okay the rack and screw for results in
[02:16:15.060 --> 02:16:19.140]  and vandalizing due process uh detaining people without accusation or
[02:16:19.140 --> 02:16:22.500]  charge anything you just yell it makes us possibly safer even though it
[02:16:22.500 --> 02:16:26.180]  doesn't you know they get away with it and that's just the opposite of what the
[02:16:26.180 --> 02:16:29.700]  constitution is about the default position that the founding
[02:16:29.700 --> 02:16:32.260]  fathers wanted that was revolutionary at the time
[02:16:32.260 --> 02:16:35.860]  was that individual liberties the default the government can't do anything
[02:16:35.860 --> 02:16:40.180]  unless it gives a really strong reason about why they should interfere with
[02:16:40.180 --> 02:16:44.100]  your physical and mental liberty and freedom it doesn't mean an insurmountable
[02:16:44.100 --> 02:16:46.580]  hurdle but that's the default position is liberty
[02:16:46.580 --> 02:16:50.580]  now no just make the government bigger bigger bigger tsa more screening
[02:16:50.580 --> 02:16:53.860]  whatever anything goes that will arguably make us safer
[02:16:53.860 --> 02:16:57.300]  you know you got to have some risk in life it takes risk when you get out of
[02:16:57.300 --> 02:17:00.740]  bed you know you could somebody could come up and drive a car when you're on
[02:17:00.740 --> 02:17:04.820]  the sidewalk as you know as you know historically i'd like
[02:17:04.820 --> 02:17:09.140]  you to speak to this briefly we tyrants always say it's for your own good
[02:17:09.140 --> 02:17:13.940]  and historically the greatest danger outside of natural death the most
[02:17:13.940 --> 02:17:18.420]  unnatural death that we've seen has been death by government or enslavement or
[02:17:18.420 --> 02:17:21.860]  impoverishment by government i mean this is the most
[02:17:21.860 --> 02:17:25.140]  dangerous thing as george washington said like fire
[02:17:25.140 --> 02:17:28.980]  government is a dangerous servant and a fearful master
[02:17:28.980 --> 02:17:34.020]  exactly right and and and that's why it is not to say that individuals can't
[02:17:34.020 --> 02:17:37.460]  perpetrate evil they can they can but in in in
[02:17:37.460 --> 02:17:40.980]  magnitudes of danger the government is capable of
[02:17:40.980 --> 02:17:44.740]  vastly more a wretchedness destruction of liberty
[02:17:44.740 --> 02:17:49.140]  death than any private individual or group of individuals and that's why the
[02:17:49.140 --> 02:17:52.420]  government is the one there the greatest scrutiny has to be put upon
[02:17:52.420 --> 02:17:56.580]  and it was james madison just think about this this is over 200 years ago
[02:17:56.580 --> 02:18:00.900]  he pointed out in the he he warned he said the instruments
[02:18:00.900 --> 02:18:04.980]  of of of repression that are used initially to fight a foreign danger
[02:18:04.980 --> 02:18:08.740]  are invariably used by tyrants to destroy liberty at home
[02:18:08.740 --> 02:18:12.180]  this is the greatest pressure you know that had ever been ordered by an
[02:18:12.180 --> 02:18:15.060]  american statement he knew exactly what's going to happen
[02:18:15.060 --> 02:18:18.180]  so first okay we're just going to use these special procedures
[02:18:18.180 --> 02:18:21.540]  in afghanistan and then iraq then yemen then samalia
[02:18:21.540 --> 02:18:25.460]  and now they're on the american american soil and what i fear
[02:18:25.460 --> 02:18:30.820]  alex is that if there's anything like another 911 or even somebody who
[02:18:30.820 --> 02:18:33.460]  stands up and says all right iran's got nuclear weapons
[02:18:33.460 --> 02:18:36.740]  now the president's going to declare martial law you know the liberty is
[02:18:36.740 --> 02:18:40.100]  going to be over okay we have military commissions and i'll restore the
[02:18:40.100 --> 02:18:44.340]  constitutional i think it's safe and i'm fearful right now we have an american
[02:18:44.340 --> 02:18:47.860]  culture that so he's seen in its defense of individual liberty
[02:18:47.860 --> 02:18:51.700]  and so willing to accept battle is to some big brother government who yells
[02:18:51.700 --> 02:18:54.100]  safe but then the president would get away with it
[02:18:54.100 --> 02:18:57.300]  well bruce that and bruce on the street you know as you know that's the end with
[02:18:57.300 --> 02:19:00.740]  the entire architecture i'm going to skip this network break here so station
[02:19:00.740 --> 02:19:02.900]  shouldn't cover this up it's a network break i'm going to skip it
[02:19:02.900 --> 02:19:06.180]  we only got you the bottom of the hour and this is so important constitutional
[02:19:06.180 --> 02:19:11.060]  law expert congressional expert ron paul's main advisor on legal issues
[02:19:11.060 --> 02:19:14.100]  constitutional lawyer bruce finney's also an author
[02:19:14.100 --> 02:19:19.380]  bruce let's shift gear is in the same area but shifting gears look at
[02:19:19.380 --> 02:19:24.580]  newt genrich newt genrich has been attacking ron paul calling him a joke
[02:19:24.580 --> 02:19:28.740]  donald trump's been calling him a joke when donald trump is a joke
[02:19:28.740 --> 02:19:32.420]  by any you know yardstick mr eminent domain mr
[02:19:32.420 --> 02:19:36.580]  democratic party contributor who claims he's a republican clearly a ringer
[02:19:36.580 --> 02:19:40.100]  but newt genrich has now been endorsed by the former fellow reserve head
[02:19:40.100 --> 02:19:46.340]  um of uh kansas city herman kane and newt genrich who is for
[02:19:46.340 --> 02:19:50.980]  indefinite detention torture all of this who's for carbon taxes
[02:19:50.980 --> 02:19:54.980]  who's for all these different globalist things he is now the frontrunner
[02:19:54.980 --> 02:19:58.660]  ron paul's admitted number two now in iowa and other states
[02:19:58.660 --> 02:20:01.860]  what's your view on newt genrich and what's wrong
[02:20:01.860 --> 02:20:05.540]  with mainline republicans or do you think these polls are a fraud
[02:20:05.540 --> 02:20:09.300]  how could any conservative with half a brain
[02:20:09.300 --> 02:20:13.140]  like newt genrich i don't know this guy is the
[02:20:13.140 --> 02:20:16.340]  the the the epitome of inside the beltway
[02:20:16.340 --> 02:20:20.980]  cynicism he's saying one thing one day the other the next day he exploits
[02:20:20.980 --> 02:20:24.340]  all the political chicanery known to mankind you know
[02:20:24.340 --> 02:20:29.220]  a historian for freddy mac and fanny may 40 50 million dollars
[02:20:29.220 --> 02:20:32.580]  that he's concurrently that he gets out of her for lobbying congress on his
[02:20:32.580 --> 02:20:36.740]  health care issue he's an egomaniac he cheats on his wife
[02:20:36.740 --> 02:20:40.820]  he has run he claims that he's great for frugality and he has a tiffani's bank
[02:20:40.820 --> 02:20:45.540]  account of five hundred thousand dollars he manipulates and utilizes uh
[02:20:45.540 --> 02:20:49.140]  nonprofit organizations to benefit his political campaign and his profit
[02:20:49.140 --> 02:20:52.580]  making organizations for free i mean any any spouse
[02:20:52.580 --> 02:20:56.740]  anything under the sun no matter how glib yet absurd they are
[02:20:56.740 --> 02:20:59.700]  i mean his statement for example the president should
[02:20:59.700 --> 02:21:04.180]  flout decisions of the u.s supreme court if they think they're wrong you know
[02:21:04.180 --> 02:21:07.860]  wow that's really something this somebody who who was talking about ron paul
[02:21:07.860 --> 02:21:11.780]  is being a joke this guy was destroyed the greatest conception
[02:21:11.780 --> 02:21:15.380]  of all constitutions in the history of the world judicial review
[02:21:15.380 --> 02:21:20.580]  in 1787 and not the whim of newt genrich no the president just fell back with a
[02:21:20.580 --> 02:21:23.860]  supreme court and you see how absurd that is because he's at the same time
[02:21:23.860 --> 02:21:26.980]  saying oh if the supreme court declares the health care bill
[02:21:26.980 --> 02:21:30.660]  unconstitutional then it should fall but at the same time he's basically saying
[02:21:30.660 --> 02:21:34.100]  well obama could just ignore it and implement the his health care anyway
[02:21:34.100 --> 02:21:38.660]  i mean the guy is a total intellectual jumble of contradictions and sentences
[02:21:38.660 --> 02:21:42.180]  and i believe that the only reason that explains his rise
[02:21:42.180 --> 02:21:45.860]  is that he's not mitt romp and mitt is so statuette
[02:21:45.860 --> 02:21:49.300]  he's so off-putting as a candidate they're sort of scrambling
[02:21:49.300 --> 02:21:52.820]  the republicans are for somebody else and newt is the candidate for that
[02:21:52.820 --> 02:21:56.740]  particular time but i believe as more of these
[02:21:56.740 --> 02:22:03.860]  uh words in newt become more known and prominent he will he will fall like a
[02:22:03.860 --> 02:22:08.020]  shooting star and a comment out of this guy and be destroyed
[02:22:08.020 --> 02:22:14.100]  because his character is so flawed that he simply cannot withstand a sustained
[02:22:14.100 --> 02:22:18.020]  public scrutiny wow bruce fine is on fire
[02:22:18.020 --> 02:22:23.220]  amazing analysis absolutely on target uh looking at newt again rich it's like
[02:22:23.220 --> 02:22:27.140]  shark teeth all all these different politicians come
[02:22:27.140 --> 02:22:30.340]  forward the public learns about them they fall away
[02:22:30.340 --> 02:22:34.500]  we've seen it with perry with romney with newt uh with
[02:22:34.500 --> 02:22:38.500]  bachmann yeah bachmann with with with all of them
[02:22:38.500 --> 02:22:42.020]  only ron paul has stayed number one number two or number three in every straw
[02:22:42.020 --> 02:22:46.180]  bowl every scientific bowl he now is and i'm not just saying this because i'm a
[02:22:46.180 --> 02:22:49.540]  ron paul supporter i'm always a realist he really is the front
[02:22:49.540 --> 02:22:53.380]  runner in all the big polls he beats obama handily
[02:22:53.380 --> 02:22:56.580]  i mean he is the man he should be our next president
[02:22:56.580 --> 02:23:00.340]  he's been dead on about why we're in so much trouble he's the only candidate
[02:23:00.340 --> 02:23:04.660]  that will actually address it and if we don't elect ron paul if the power
[02:23:04.660 --> 02:23:08.340]  structure doesn't elect ron paul i mean that as corrupt as the power
[02:23:08.340 --> 02:23:11.460]  structure is they can't just keep robbing and stealing
[02:23:11.460 --> 02:23:14.740]  they're going to kill the golden goose your take on that
[02:23:14.740 --> 02:23:17.860]  yeah i think that's right but but the history of empire is the history of
[02:23:17.860 --> 02:23:20.820]  self-ruination uh but i certainly agree with your
[02:23:20.820 --> 02:23:24.020]  assessment of ron paul and this is what i can say
[02:23:24.020 --> 02:23:29.380]  with a hundred percent first-hand certain he is the only candidate who's not
[02:23:29.380 --> 02:23:32.820]  running for self-aggrandite he's the only candidate who's not
[02:23:32.820 --> 02:23:36.580]  driven by evil means he's the only candidate that we know when he's in the
[02:23:36.580 --> 02:23:39.380]  oval office and he makes the decision he will be made
[02:23:39.380 --> 02:23:44.500]  based upon what he thinks are best for the nation and those yet to be born
[02:23:44.500 --> 02:23:48.260]  it won't be based upon the next day's polls or political maneuvering or
[02:23:48.260 --> 02:23:50.900]  footprints in the sand of time or anything like that
[02:23:50.900 --> 02:23:54.980]  and that's enormously important because there are going to be issues that we
[02:23:54.980 --> 02:23:58.340]  can't contemplate or only can be dimly perceived right now
[02:23:58.340 --> 02:24:01.940]  that will emerge in the next four years and we need to have confidence in the
[02:24:01.940 --> 02:24:05.860]  character of the man that no matter what that his big
[02:24:05.860 --> 02:24:11.460]  focus in his only north star will be what's good for the country it's not my
[02:24:11.460 --> 02:24:14.500]  particular ego that's big it's not like well i'm
[02:24:14.500 --> 02:24:18.020]  i'm too much bothered in trying to run the world to worry about the local
[02:24:18.020 --> 02:24:20.500]  economy because i'm worrying about to bed or
[02:24:20.500 --> 02:24:24.740]  nopal or yemen or something like that he wants to defend the united states
[02:24:24.740 --> 02:24:29.140]  safety and the economy but in the united states and that's why i think he should
[02:24:29.140 --> 02:24:33.380]  be a hands-down pick and remember this idea that ron paul you know he
[02:24:33.380 --> 02:24:37.780]  doesn't have a foreign policy it's weak is absurd if there's one person who's
[02:24:37.780 --> 02:24:42.260]  the most hawkish on defending america as opposed to defending afghans or
[02:24:42.260 --> 02:24:46.740]  defending iraqis or yemen it is ron paul because he wants our defense
[02:24:46.740 --> 02:24:50.820]  resources devoted to protecting us and he was also in the air force let me
[02:24:50.820 --> 02:24:54.580]  seeing everybody under the sun let me expand on that netanyahu kicked out
[02:24:54.580 --> 02:24:58.820]  the the last head of misad because he didn't want to strike iran
[02:24:58.820 --> 02:25:01.700]  and the former head of misad was in herets the other day saying it'll be a
[02:25:01.700 --> 02:25:05.300]  catastrophe if they strike him right now iran's already threatened to shut down
[02:25:05.300 --> 02:25:09.940]  the street or most they've shot down a drone all of this is accelerating
[02:25:09.940 --> 02:25:14.180]  but obama wants the political distraction netanyahu may want it
[02:25:14.180 --> 02:25:17.460]  and then ron paul got banned from this latest debate
[02:25:17.460 --> 02:25:21.140]  and the group said well because you you know you're not realistic on iran
[02:25:21.140 --> 02:25:24.980]  when i've seen polls of the majority of israelis don't want to do this
[02:25:24.980 --> 02:25:29.140]  and i know you're advising him on uh a legal things in the constitution
[02:25:29.140 --> 02:25:34.260]  but where is a preemptive strike with the us backing it in the constitution
[02:25:34.260 --> 02:25:38.020]  on iran and and then when that you actually look at what ron paul actually
[02:25:38.020 --> 02:25:41.940]  says it's the the researched view of the big
[02:25:41.940 --> 02:25:45.540]  think tanks of the cia ron paul's the only one
[02:25:45.540 --> 02:25:49.860]  actually living in reality geopolitically he's that is absolutely
[02:25:49.860 --> 02:25:52.180]  right there's nothing in the constitution that
[02:25:52.180 --> 02:25:57.060]  authorizes preemptive war don ron paul called him anticipatory self defense
[02:25:57.060 --> 02:26:00.500]  the defense means you defend yourself against an attack
[02:26:00.500 --> 02:26:03.940]  not that you initiate intact you defend against an attack and that's what the
[02:26:03.940 --> 02:26:07.380]  constitution says in the preamble or otherwise and moreover
[02:26:07.380 --> 02:26:10.660]  ron paul's position is the sensible position let's
[02:26:10.660 --> 02:26:15.300]  scale out what the other side says first they say well iran is so crazy
[02:26:15.300 --> 02:26:19.300]  even if you attempt to deter them by promising nuclear incineration if they
[02:26:19.300 --> 02:26:23.700]  attack us they crave self-destruction well that's insane
[02:26:23.700 --> 02:26:27.300]  and what did the iranians do even with the itolas and the mall is
[02:26:27.300 --> 02:26:30.820]  they negotiated the release of our hostages finally from tehran
[02:26:30.820 --> 02:26:35.380]  they brought a conclusion to the iraqi iran war brought by Saddam Hussein
[02:26:35.380 --> 02:26:39.220]  remember we shot down an airliner a civilian airliner the u.s. defense
[02:26:39.220 --> 02:26:43.540]  sends over the persian gulf we killed over 200 they negotiated that so we paid
[02:26:43.540 --> 02:26:46.660]  the money they didn't go to war they're like any other country
[02:26:46.660 --> 02:26:50.100]  you know the idea that somehow iran displays more
[02:26:50.100 --> 02:26:53.860]  you know irrationality the north korean we can't deter them with our nuclear
[02:26:53.860 --> 02:26:58.260]  arms is ridiculous moreover let's understand why does
[02:26:58.260 --> 02:27:04.340]  iran cling to nuclear arms largely because we have had a policy
[02:27:04.340 --> 02:27:08.340]  championed and initiated by newt gingrich of overthrowing the government
[02:27:08.340 --> 02:27:12.260]  by force and violence they remember our overthrow of mosadek the only
[02:27:12.260 --> 02:27:15.860]  democratically elected officials in this you know in the last
[02:27:15.860 --> 02:27:18.900]  century in iran we overthrew him to get the shah of iran
[02:27:18.900 --> 02:27:22.900]  bruce it's worse than that as you know it's now admitted that since bush five
[02:27:22.900 --> 02:27:26.740]  years ago and currently england israel and the us
[02:27:26.740 --> 02:27:30.020]  have been running covert operations here's french 24
[02:27:30.020 --> 02:27:35.140]  us israel covert war against iran suspected it's not suspected when giant
[02:27:35.140 --> 02:27:37.540]  bases are blowing up and then scientists are
[02:27:37.540 --> 02:27:40.980]  fascinated yeah exactly right we know there so yeah
[02:27:40.980 --> 02:27:44.260]  yeah when when a country is confronting an
[02:27:44.260 --> 02:27:47.700]  adversary who says we're going to overthrow your regime yeah they're
[02:27:47.700 --> 02:27:50.660]  ordinarily likely to look at self defense and they see what happened to
[02:27:50.660 --> 02:27:54.580]  qaddafi in libya qaddafi was an attack in the united states we just got up and
[02:27:54.580 --> 02:27:58.580]  said hey you know let's throw that guy out so we are creating
[02:27:58.580 --> 02:28:02.340]  the environment that creates the incentive for them to let me ask you
[02:28:02.340 --> 02:28:06.180]  this question what one point i'd like to make i'll assist it to finish this
[02:28:06.180 --> 02:28:10.340]  out the only issue in which all iranians agree
[02:28:10.340 --> 02:28:14.980]  including those who despise the mullet as they want and need a nuclear armament
[02:28:14.980 --> 02:28:18.740]  now because the united states we are unifying the iranian
[02:28:18.740 --> 02:28:22.740]  and the fact is other countries when they have reached a level
[02:28:22.740 --> 02:28:26.660]  of security have abandoned nuclear weapons it's not like once you get them
[02:28:26.660 --> 02:28:29.540]  you never give them up south africa had them at one time
[02:28:29.540 --> 02:28:33.060]  they got a bit rid of them belarus had them they got rid of them cadets that
[02:28:33.060 --> 02:28:36.340]  got rid of them uh... you i mean uh... ukraine had them at
[02:28:36.340 --> 02:28:39.220]  one time got rid of them so they listen i don't i don't
[02:28:39.220 --> 02:28:42.340]  champion and not you know proliferation but the fact is
[02:28:42.340 --> 02:28:45.860]  if you have a regime that's not friend you could probably develop
[02:28:45.860 --> 02:28:49.700]  the the internal consensus to get rid of them because basically
[02:28:49.700 --> 02:28:54.740]  they're useless in ordinary war all the nuclear weapons we had didn't win in
[02:28:54.740 --> 02:28:57.940]  vietnam all the nuclear weapons that israel had had
[02:28:57.940 --> 02:29:00.580]  nothing to do with the yam kappa war and so
[02:29:00.580 --> 02:29:04.900]  we have the ability by not threatening overthrow regimes to create a climate
[02:29:04.900 --> 02:29:07.540]  well they won't have any incentive to create
[02:29:07.540 --> 02:29:10.100]  bruce i thought we only had you for 20 but i've learned the producer we have
[02:29:10.100 --> 02:29:12.740]  here about 10 more in the next segment so now i'll have time to
[02:29:12.740 --> 02:29:15.540]  get to my questions but we're about to go to break i want to pose the questions
[02:29:15.540 --> 02:29:17.540]  to you now and we'll come back
[02:29:17.540 --> 02:29:22.100]  what then is the real strategy of the fortune 100 in the big megabanks
[02:29:22.100 --> 02:29:25.220]  manipulating our government israel and europe england
[02:29:25.220 --> 02:29:28.820]  what do they want out of this destabilization why would they want to
[02:29:28.820 --> 02:29:31.140]  put the muslim brotherhood in all over the middle east
[02:29:31.140 --> 02:29:33.700]  why would they want to put al-qaeda in in libya
[02:29:33.700 --> 02:29:37.220]  when qaddafi been playing ball for seven years and taking total
[02:29:37.220 --> 02:29:42.020]  you know western investment why why do they want so much destabilization
[02:29:42.020 --> 02:29:45.780]  why don't they want to just be friends with everybody like ron paul has said

[02:31:41.460 --> 02:31:44.660]  checkout to today seems like nobody does care and right

[02:33:12.580 --> 02:33:22.100]  of man thomas jefferson it's alex jones on the gcm radio network
[02:33:22.100 --> 02:33:25.060]  by the way he's got his new book out and it is
[02:33:25.060 --> 02:33:29.300]  powerful american empire before the fall
[02:33:29.300 --> 02:33:33.780]  available at amazon and other bookstores everywhere barns and noble
[02:33:33.780 --> 02:33:37.860]  bruce finds new book american empire before the fall
[02:33:37.860 --> 02:33:42.500]  and a large portion of the proceeds goes to the campaign for liberty
[02:33:42.500 --> 02:33:46.260]  and see these these global interests they're just working the levers of the
[02:33:46.260 --> 02:33:49.300]  american empire that we paid for and we don't get anything
[02:33:49.300 --> 02:33:52.660]  and the one thing was like the british empire 200 years ago where if you were
[02:33:52.660 --> 02:33:55.940]  an englishman and served it sometimes you could actually get
[02:33:55.940 --> 02:34:00.020]  get something out of serving the empire on average here this is not the case
[02:34:00.020 --> 02:34:03.780]  and i'm not endorsing an evil empire where you actually get some of the loot
[02:34:03.780 --> 02:34:08.500]  i'm just saying in this one you pay for it in blood treasure your name
[02:34:08.500 --> 02:34:14.580]  america now is this example worldwide we're dictators and thugs and oligarchs
[02:34:14.580 --> 02:34:18.980]  endorse their torture their secret arrest off of what we're doing
[02:34:18.980 --> 02:34:22.180]  the egyptian police have named themselves homeland security
[02:34:22.180 --> 02:34:25.220]  when they rubber bullet people and arrest them now and torture
[02:34:25.220 --> 02:34:29.300]  i mean this is an amazing transfer transformation we've seen bruce finds
[02:34:29.300 --> 02:34:33.220]  our guest so so bruce you heard my question
[02:34:33.220 --> 02:34:38.020]  what is the thinking of the global elite because they're debasing europe they're
[02:34:38.020 --> 02:34:41.540]  debasing america they're debasing england they're debasing israel they're
[02:34:41.540 --> 02:34:46.740]  debasing australia they're wrecking all of their own power sectors
[02:34:46.740 --> 02:34:50.660]  whereas in the past we had some you know corrupt leaders sometimes but
[02:34:50.660 --> 02:34:56.180]  they still understood the basic idea of not wrecking your own
[02:34:56.180 --> 02:35:01.220]  command base so i guess we're seeing the nero or caligula type
[02:35:01.220 --> 02:35:06.180]  tuberous the insanity what's your view on why they're doing this and what the
[02:35:06.180 --> 02:35:09.940]  end game is why put al-qaeda in charge of libya
[02:35:09.940 --> 02:35:15.540]  well i i think that there are two uh two driving motivations here one for
[02:35:15.540 --> 02:35:19.220]  politicians and one for the what you call the military terrorism
[02:35:19.220 --> 02:35:23.460]  uh complex but i i think alex we we need to understand that
[02:35:23.460 --> 02:35:29.620]  uh empires uh are not smart that even that even if they think
[02:35:29.620 --> 02:35:33.220]  what they're doing is good for them in the long run they destroy themselves
[02:35:33.220 --> 02:35:37.540]  that is they can be very very stupid and foolish indeed that's what caused
[02:35:37.540 --> 02:35:44.100]  uh mr uh given to sit at the corner of the dilapidated roman coliseum and to
[02:35:44.100 --> 02:35:48.900]  ask why was it dilapidated after it had such a brilliant you know obelisk
[02:35:48.900 --> 02:35:52.100]  status and iconic status for so many centuries so
[02:35:52.100 --> 02:35:55.140]  we can't believe that just because they're doing it there's any wisdom
[02:35:55.140 --> 02:35:58.180]  behind it but now we can get to the short-term motives i think
[02:35:58.180 --> 02:36:02.820]  that politically the reason for this drive for empire and intervention and
[02:36:02.820 --> 02:36:06.100]  meddling everywhere is this kind of thrill it's sort of a
[02:36:06.100 --> 02:36:10.180]  an animalistic thrill of domination for the sake of domination it was captured
[02:36:10.180 --> 02:36:13.940]  in julia's thesis you know i came i saw i conquered and so
[02:36:13.940 --> 02:36:16.660]  if presidents get in and they think well gee you know i don't want to worry
[02:36:16.660 --> 02:36:19.860]  about minimum wage i want to conquer the world that's what the president is
[02:36:19.860 --> 02:36:23.220]  about you know madeline albright colon pal what the hell is it
[02:36:23.220 --> 02:36:26.660]  have the greatest army and navy and air force and marines in the world and not
[02:36:26.660 --> 02:36:30.740]  use them you know we got to use them and there is a sense of okay this is my
[02:36:30.740 --> 02:36:34.820]  identity of just acting like a bully on the playground it gives them thrill if
[02:36:34.820 --> 02:36:38.500]  you're if you're an adolescent and that's why it's not just in the place that
[02:36:38.500 --> 02:36:42.020]  you talk to afghanistan iraq nothing happens in the world
[02:36:42.020 --> 02:36:44.900]  no barundi we we you know we want to interfere in barundi
[02:36:44.900 --> 02:36:48.500]  or the central african republic or in the paul anything we have a foreign
[02:36:48.500 --> 02:36:52.020]  policy position on it says they know we're interested in what happens in
[02:36:52.020 --> 02:36:55.060]  mankind but we know we just need to be worried about american
[02:36:55.060 --> 02:36:59.140]  making it as perfect as we can and and our example can have influence but
[02:36:59.140 --> 02:37:01.460]  otherwise other people got to take care of themselves
[02:37:01.460 --> 02:37:05.220]  but this idea of meddling everywhere wanting to play all roses
[02:37:05.220 --> 02:37:08.500]  it reminds me of nicolas bottom in the midsummer night's dream where he wants
[02:37:08.500 --> 02:37:12.340]  to play all all the parts in the play you know that's what we and then sort of
[02:37:12.340 --> 02:37:16.580]  a sense of grandeur by doing that and then the military
[02:37:16.580 --> 02:37:21.220]  terrorism complex it doesn't because the money i mean just staring sums out there
[02:37:21.220 --> 02:37:24.420]  how many of the audience know that this very day we are spending
[02:37:24.420 --> 02:37:30.340]  350 million dollars in afghanistan alone in afghanistan alone look at the
[02:37:30.340 --> 02:37:32.980]  billions look at the billions for the naked body
[02:37:32.980 --> 02:37:36.820]  scanners and the insider trading right there of
[02:37:36.820 --> 02:37:40.340]  cherdoff putting the order in and then going to the company
[02:37:40.340 --> 02:37:43.620]  to actually profit from what he did and then congress gets caught insider
[02:37:43.620 --> 02:37:46.500]  trading and says we're just allowed to do this it's
[02:37:46.500 --> 02:37:51.540]  it's staggering how they flaunt it in our face so let me ask you this question
[02:37:51.540 --> 02:37:56.100]  then looking you know historically out there you mentioned
[02:37:56.100 --> 02:38:01.300]  the megalomania the arrogance of newt genrich studying these politicians
[02:38:01.300 --> 02:38:05.220]  they really enjoy going to the parties getting the awards
[02:38:05.220 --> 02:38:08.420]  a normal person just wants to sit at home and read a book by the fire
[02:38:08.420 --> 02:38:11.620]  and and and so that's why we're kind of blind to them and i agree with you
[02:38:11.620 --> 02:38:14.500]  ron paul's the only person who truly is dedicated
[02:38:14.500 --> 02:38:17.860]  has a grasp on history the rest are a bunch of fawning
[02:38:17.860 --> 02:38:21.220]  sycophants that have sold out a thousand times a thousand
[02:38:21.220 --> 02:38:24.580]  and that's why they're where they're at how do we beat these people
[02:38:24.580 --> 02:38:28.580]  we do see liberty rising freedom is popular how do you see these two
[02:38:28.580 --> 02:38:31.860]  opposing forces coming together what's your prognosis on the
[02:38:31.860 --> 02:38:35.060]  future i don't think the future is
[02:38:35.060 --> 02:38:38.420]  determinant you know in in some sense the amerson was right history is
[02:38:38.420 --> 02:38:41.940]  biography history what you me and what our audience does
[02:38:41.940 --> 02:38:45.460]  and we basically are at the at the bottom of
[02:38:45.460 --> 02:38:49.540]  of mount afris in in this progress to try to recapture liberty
[02:38:49.540 --> 02:38:53.140]  at the center of our constitutional universe with ron paul
[02:38:53.140 --> 02:38:57.860]  uh certainly i believe where there's optimism because ron paul's ideas
[02:38:57.860 --> 02:39:01.380]  although they're still attempted to be shunned by much of the media
[02:39:01.380 --> 02:39:05.220]  he's got into the the mainstream at least with regard to the absurd
[02:39:05.220 --> 02:39:08.660]  billions trillions lent by the federal reserve and some people are more
[02:39:08.660 --> 02:39:12.580]  hesitant about these endless wars but they're not the majority at least that
[02:39:12.580 --> 02:39:15.780]  president so but you don't need a majority
[02:39:15.780 --> 02:39:19.540]  necessarily to prevail it's the intensity factor alex was
[02:39:19.540 --> 02:39:23.140]  and reject and one said a majority is one man or woman with courage
[02:39:23.140 --> 02:39:26.980]  and what we need to have that resolution that we're going to go out we're going
[02:39:26.980 --> 02:39:30.420]  to argue we're going to write we're going to vote we're going to protest
[02:39:30.420 --> 02:39:34.580]  we may lose but we're not going to give up and it may well be that that ron
[02:39:34.580 --> 02:39:37.780]  doesn't win this time around although i'm i have a
[02:39:37.780 --> 02:39:41.620]  a healthy um uh optimism that that he's going to win
[02:39:41.620 --> 02:39:45.140]  iowa because the dedication of his people but the critical thing to
[02:39:45.140 --> 02:39:47.700]  understand is politics never has an end point
[02:39:47.700 --> 02:39:51.220]  there's never going to be one victory where you you get across the touchdown
[02:39:51.220 --> 02:39:54.660]  line and then you can slacken off because human nature
[02:39:54.660 --> 02:39:59.540]  is inevitably by going to gravitate towards the lowest common denominator it
[02:39:59.540 --> 02:40:04.740]  needs thrill it needs leadership it needs the influence of example by the
[02:40:04.740 --> 02:40:08.980]  like of uh of uh of ron paul and george washington so
[02:40:08.980 --> 02:40:12.260]  this is we've got to understand that our quest is never ending
[02:40:12.260 --> 02:40:16.020]  every generation is going to have to win it for itself and keep it for itself
[02:40:16.020 --> 02:40:20.660]  because the natural course of mankind is tyranny whether tyranny by one or
[02:40:20.660 --> 02:40:24.500]  tyranny by the majority it takes a very very educated and
[02:40:24.500 --> 02:40:28.260]  committed idol a kind of of society to celebrate
[02:40:28.260 --> 02:40:33.300]  liberty and take some risks and that is what we have to recognize we're about
[02:40:33.300 --> 02:40:36.660]  not just our generation we have to pass on to our successors
[02:40:36.660 --> 02:40:41.060]  this intensity factor this commitment to know no it's never going to end at an
[02:40:41.060 --> 02:40:43.860]  end of a particular election and whether we win or lose
[02:40:43.860 --> 02:40:47.140]  it is the ideas and this is what ron knows more than anyone else
[02:40:47.140 --> 02:40:51.220]  certainly others all of his rivals the ideas that is going to lead us
[02:40:51.220 --> 02:40:55.220]  as to how we spend our time each day protecting liberty
[02:40:55.220 --> 02:40:58.900]  shunning uh big brother government and and craving the
[02:40:58.900 --> 02:41:02.820]  the kind of independence that gives us a self-fulfillment and pride
[02:41:02.820 --> 02:41:06.180]  of being a human being that has response to the adult
[02:41:06.180 --> 02:41:09.860]  commands of virtue wisdom and magnanimity and ladies and gentlemen
[02:41:09.860 --> 02:41:13.060]  that's bruce fine without a teleprompter ron paul without a
[02:41:13.060 --> 02:41:18.820]  teleprompter alex shone's without one we have research we are
[02:41:18.820 --> 02:41:23.540]  passionate about freedom we don't need teleprompters and and so many people
[02:41:23.540 --> 02:41:27.140]  are sold on the idea that being involved is boring
[02:41:27.140 --> 02:41:31.060]  or a chore but i'm here to tell you 17 years into the fight ladies and
[02:41:31.060 --> 02:41:35.300]  gentlemen or more now that as thomas jefferson said
[02:41:35.300 --> 02:41:41.220]  it is the animating contest of liberty it is animating it is exciting to be
[02:41:41.220 --> 02:41:44.740]  informed it's exciting to study history and politics and
[02:41:44.740 --> 02:41:48.420]  law and as you learn more it starts connecting and you learn more and more
[02:41:48.420 --> 02:41:52.180]  and you realize how much you don't know and then you accelerate your learning
[02:41:52.180 --> 02:41:56.500]  and then you become humble in in time and space you realize it's about the human
[02:41:56.500 --> 02:42:00.100]  species it's about the journey it's about empowerment
[02:42:00.100 --> 02:42:04.980]  it's about destiny and and and then you look at those who don't even want to
[02:42:04.980 --> 02:42:10.660]  know about history or or those who don't admire humanities
[02:42:10.660 --> 02:42:15.060]  great deeds then you feel sorry for them and i think in the final equation
[02:42:15.060 --> 02:42:20.020]  that's the crossroads we're at right now bruce final comments on that and then
[02:42:20.020 --> 02:42:24.180]  tell us about your new book no i i think you're absolutely right it i
[02:42:24.180 --> 02:42:28.740]  certainly based i i've been watching in 43 years uh the greatest thrills are
[02:42:28.740 --> 02:42:31.940]  not winning the lawsuits it's being out there and arguing
[02:42:31.940 --> 02:42:35.620]  for the highest principles that animated our founding fathers and and doing
[02:42:35.620 --> 02:42:38.420]  justice to those who have sacrificed so much
[02:42:38.420 --> 02:42:43.300]  uh before so that we can live free and to have freedom of press freedom of
[02:42:43.300 --> 02:42:47.140]  speech freedom of inquiry and that's just gotta burn on you and it never goes
[02:42:47.140 --> 02:42:50.980]  away it's not like you get to a to a stage of retirement where you no longer
[02:42:50.980 --> 02:42:54.580]  are involved with fighting for liberty the great thing about the quest is that
[02:42:54.580 --> 02:42:57.300]  it never ends right up to your last dying breath
[02:42:57.300 --> 02:43:00.980]  it'll still be stimulating you giving you that kind of adrenaline
[02:43:00.980 --> 02:43:06.020]  uh to keep you active and uh and participatory every day of your whole
[02:43:06.020 --> 02:43:10.420]  life and and it's that instinct that we owe all civilization
[02:43:10.420 --> 02:43:14.180]  and creativity and everything good it has all flowed
[02:43:14.180 --> 02:43:18.580]  from that instinct for liberty and freedom that drive yeah yeah the very
[02:43:18.580 --> 02:43:20.980]  first person who stood up and said slavery and
[02:43:20.980 --> 02:43:25.300]  subservience is bad we all owe great homage to that
[02:43:25.300 --> 02:43:28.660]  individual even if it didn't succeed on that particular day and you're right
[02:43:28.660 --> 02:43:31.140]  it's the torch of civilization that we're trying to
[02:43:31.140 --> 02:43:35.940]  to keep alive here um that with regard to you know my my last book was American
[02:43:35.940 --> 02:43:40.020]  empire before the fall i think it expands upon all the ideas that we've
[02:43:40.020 --> 02:43:44.420]  discussed today alex i am uh involved in another book it's going to
[02:43:44.420 --> 02:43:47.860]  compare the motivations of the human species compared to the
[02:43:47.860 --> 02:43:51.140]  the lower species and to try to compare and contrast and
[02:43:51.140 --> 02:43:54.660]  suggest is it clear which is the superior animal you know and where we've
[02:43:54.660 --> 02:43:59.860]  got to uh to restore you know the ultimate the values
[02:43:59.860 --> 02:44:03.940]  that have been uh the guiding light that's right the globalist always want
[02:44:03.940 --> 02:44:07.620]  to tell us that we're not special because they know we are we can direct
[02:44:07.620 --> 02:44:11.780]  our own development give us 60 seconds on your view on that
[02:44:11.780 --> 02:44:14.820]  no absolutely we can we can and this is what i'm
[02:44:14.820 --> 02:44:18.660]  i'm suggesting we have we have minds we have brains and
[02:44:18.660 --> 02:44:22.660]  the brains are to try to extract what lincoln called the better angels of
[02:44:22.660 --> 02:44:26.980]  our nature by imitation by leadership by character
[02:44:26.980 --> 02:44:30.740]  so that that and recognizing and living really for the ages
[02:44:30.740 --> 02:44:34.580]  not necessarily physically but so our character will speak to someone born a
[02:44:34.580 --> 02:44:38.180]  thousand years from yes because they will struggle for those same reasons
[02:44:38.180 --> 02:44:42.340]  why are we here between ashes to ashes and dust to dust what is virtue or not
[02:44:42.340 --> 02:44:46.100]  and in that sense we our lives are eternal that's that's what we have to
[02:44:46.100 --> 02:44:49.300]  strive for well that's how you live on is by
[02:44:49.300 --> 02:44:53.700]  transmitting that information it's not arrogance that you want your ideas and
[02:44:53.700 --> 02:44:58.260]  information to be passed on you're passing the baton as well from those that
[02:44:58.260 --> 02:45:02.340]  came before you it is love of the species it's a love letter to the future
[02:45:02.340 --> 02:45:07.060]  it is truly how we live forever not just through our progeny but through our
[02:45:07.060 --> 02:45:10.980]  ideas and more and more this great foundational truth
[02:45:10.980 --> 02:45:13.780]  bruce is being echoed by people it's not until
[02:45:13.780 --> 02:45:17.860]  tyranny comes in like a flood to quote the bible the spirit of the lord lifts
[02:45:17.860 --> 02:45:21.140]  up a standard against it and you and ron paul or others and and
[02:45:21.140 --> 02:45:23.540]  just briefly getting back to ron paul before we let you go
[02:45:23.540 --> 02:45:27.620]  look at how four years ago he he ran he's probably gotten five
[02:45:27.620 --> 02:45:30.420]  six seven times the attention the energy this time
[02:45:30.420 --> 02:45:34.020]  then when he didn't win the establishment said oh look all that wasted no
[02:45:34.020 --> 02:45:38.340]  he'd built a platform now look how far he's getting and he may not this time
[02:45:38.340 --> 02:45:42.180]  he actually may but it may be ran or somebody else down the road
[02:45:42.180 --> 02:45:46.740]  it's that focal point look at how 20 years ago he couldn't get one co-sponsor
[02:45:46.740 --> 02:45:49.780]  or 16 years ago when he first got back in congress 17 years ago
[02:45:49.780 --> 02:45:53.700]  he couldn't get one co-sponsor now he passed off the fed in the house
[02:45:53.700 --> 02:45:57.780]  and and he didn't win this time but resistance is victory the system is
[02:45:57.780 --> 02:46:00.580]  scared we've got moles inside bill de burgues
[02:46:00.580 --> 02:46:04.500]  and they are scared of ron paul why because
[02:46:04.500 --> 02:46:08.820]  it's now the hottest thing on campus it's not mainline republicanism or
[02:46:08.820 --> 02:46:11.620]  communism it's now liberty they're scared
[02:46:11.620 --> 02:46:16.260]  they see the youth and and and not the ones playing xbox that don't care but
[02:46:16.260 --> 02:46:19.140]  the real youth that are going to be the five ten percent
[02:46:19.140 --> 02:46:22.180]  are now their brains are lighting up for liberty
[02:46:22.180 --> 02:46:26.340]  and that scares the system yeah so this is exactly right and it's
[02:46:26.340 --> 02:46:30.100]  in a different context alex i don't want to overstate the analogy but
[02:46:30.100 --> 02:46:33.700]  if we look right now in the white house you know we have someone in the white
[02:46:33.700 --> 02:46:36.660]  house is black and but he's really there because people
[02:46:36.660 --> 02:46:40.020]  40 or 50 years and i was involved in the civil rights movement
[02:46:40.020 --> 02:46:43.220]  as well we're working they're in in the white house and
[02:46:43.220 --> 02:46:47.860]  and i don't think you really understand um what was necessary in order to
[02:46:47.860 --> 02:46:50.580]  develop there that's a different issue with regard to race but
[02:46:50.580 --> 02:46:54.500]  we're talking about basically the same thing and what's so magnificent about
[02:46:54.500 --> 02:46:58.260]  ron paul is that he doesn't care if he's not the one who occupies the white
[02:46:58.260 --> 02:47:01.620]  house and someone else stands on his soldiers and gets in the oval office
[02:47:01.620 --> 02:47:04.980]  he'll clap he'll be the first one to clap even though he's the one
[02:47:04.980 --> 02:47:09.380]  by all merit injustice who ought to be there and that is the earmark of someone
[02:47:09.380 --> 02:47:12.340]  who's truly is truly great if they say it's
[02:47:12.340 --> 02:47:15.700]  statesmanship's finest hour when you have someone like ron paul
[02:47:15.700 --> 02:47:19.780]  well we can't overstate it in a final conclusion he is founding father
[02:47:19.780 --> 02:47:22.500]  material if ron paul could be teleported back
[02:47:22.500 --> 02:47:28.500]  235 240 years ago would he not be you know amongst the grace there
[02:47:28.500 --> 02:47:31.700]  absolutely and all those running for office
[02:47:31.700 --> 02:47:35.060]  he's the only one who had been given an invitation
[02:47:35.060 --> 02:47:39.780]  to enter the constitutional convention of 1787 in Philadelphia
[02:47:39.780 --> 02:47:45.300]  all the others would have been given no vacancy or eviction notice
[02:47:45.300 --> 02:47:49.700]  beautiful bruise fine um you're doing a great so how are you advising the
[02:47:49.700 --> 02:47:53.300]  campaign just on constitutional issues well it's a i'm senior policy
[02:47:53.300 --> 02:47:56.260]  advisors you can imagine it's a rather hectic and
[02:47:56.260 --> 02:48:00.180]  they can travel a campaign is very very hectic so
[02:48:00.180 --> 02:48:03.780]  right uh right off edge to speak on shows like this and
[02:48:03.780 --> 02:48:07.060]  and give guidance there i think we think in such
[02:48:07.060 --> 02:48:11.780]  automatic uh same furrows we don't really have to talk to know exactly
[02:48:11.780 --> 02:48:15.220]  what kind of approach to take on this and that's they say the great thing
[02:48:15.220 --> 02:48:19.620]  about ron i don't have to memorize well what was he yesterday before today
[02:48:19.620 --> 02:48:22.020]  you know like all the other candidates you never know
[02:48:22.020 --> 02:48:25.460]  i hear you're expressing their viewpoint through what the human weather
[02:48:25.460 --> 02:48:28.420]  vein is saying so it's really it's really
[02:48:28.420 --> 02:48:31.700]  delight for working with ron and his team there i think everybody is really
[02:48:31.700 --> 02:48:34.500]  devoted and none of this is self-aggrandizement or
[02:48:34.500 --> 02:48:38.500]  pettiness so it's uh going to be uh one of my memories for
[02:48:38.500 --> 02:48:42.900]  life whether we ultimately win or lose what can we do more than anything to
[02:48:42.900 --> 02:48:45.620]  help the campaign a lot of people don't know about trying to be
[02:48:45.620 --> 02:48:49.300]  involved in the party caucuses they don't know about being delegates
[02:48:49.300 --> 02:48:52.980]  they don't understand that right now every little thing they do is going to
[02:48:52.980 --> 02:48:56.500]  have a huge effect the system has been trying to black him out give him 89
[02:48:56.500 --> 02:48:59.620]  seconds in a debate because they're scared yeah
[02:48:59.620 --> 02:49:03.780]  well the best thing to do is write write letters to um the media saying why are
[02:49:03.780 --> 02:49:06.740]  you blacking out ron paul he should get same
[02:49:06.740 --> 02:49:10.180]  prominence uh commensurate with his popularity as others
[02:49:10.180 --> 02:49:14.260]  and uh and also can talk to friends and find out what the rules are in your
[02:49:14.260 --> 02:49:18.900]  particular state every state has different um uh ground rules for
[02:49:18.900 --> 02:49:22.900]  whether it's caucus or primary about how you come out of how you vote how you
[02:49:22.900 --> 02:49:26.500]  can uh make certain that your voice asserted the primary state so
[02:49:26.500 --> 02:49:30.100]  master that so you know exactly when where and how and encourage all your
[02:49:30.100 --> 02:49:33.380]  friends to show up but you're exactly right i like where a whole lot of
[02:49:33.380 --> 02:49:36.500]  penetration can be made is the young people because they haven't been
[02:49:36.500 --> 02:49:40.100]  co-opted into the the military industrial complex yet
[02:49:40.100 --> 02:49:43.460]  and they're the ones who could make a huge difference in the primary states by
[02:49:43.460 --> 02:49:47.060]  turning out they've got a lot of kinetic energy they're really the ones who
[02:49:47.060 --> 02:49:50.980]  have in some sense supposed to stake because unless this trajectory changes
[02:49:50.980 --> 02:49:53.540]  and the way that ron paul is pointing towards
[02:49:53.540 --> 02:49:58.420]  they will inherit a if it's not a total tyranny it'll be a semi tyranny
[02:49:58.420 --> 02:50:01.860]  and they have very very difficult time extricating themselves so if they want
[02:50:01.860 --> 02:50:06.100]  to enjoy the liberties they got now as they may have to focus themselves on
[02:50:06.100 --> 02:50:10.580]  this particular presidential race and some are listening right now who won't
[02:50:10.580 --> 02:50:13.140]  take it to heart but the seed is planted and as
[02:50:13.140 --> 02:50:17.380]  things get worse they'll remember bruce fine incredible interview godspeed and
[02:50:17.380 --> 02:50:22.420]  i'm glad ron paul's got you in there uh as being a the senior policy advisor he
[02:50:22.420 --> 02:50:25.780]  couldn't have found somebody better thank you so much all right thanks
[02:50:25.780 --> 02:50:29.460]  good day thank you all right there goes bruce fine very very
[02:50:29.460 --> 02:50:32.580]  exciting to hear that and of course he's going to get attacked a lot and
[02:50:32.580 --> 02:50:34.980]  everything a lot of disinformation and stuff because
[02:50:34.980 --> 02:50:38.740]  the system is scared to death of what's happening but uh bruce fine definitely
[02:50:38.740 --> 02:50:42.900]  burns with the desire for liberty and that's very exciting
[02:50:42.900 --> 02:50:46.420]  okay i'm going to come back i've already pretty much gotten into iran but

[02:54:16.740 --> 02:54:19.860]  look at these headlines
[02:54:19.860 --> 02:54:23.940]  Iran blasts completely destroyed major missile testing site they tell us weeks
[02:54:23.940 --> 02:54:26.500]  later Israel and U.S. intelligence officials tell
[02:54:26.500 --> 02:54:31.540]  New York Times recent explosion military base their Tehran was major setback
[02:54:31.540 --> 02:54:36.740]  to Iran's long-range missile program and Israel tacitly admits they did it
[02:54:36.740 --> 02:54:39.860]  here's a U.S. Israel covert war against Iran
[02:54:39.860 --> 02:54:44.500]  and Iran is sitting there and taking it again
[02:54:44.500 --> 02:54:49.140]  it's just like Bruce Fine just said this is madness
[02:54:49.140 --> 02:54:51.940]  and I've been talking to Lindsay Williams we're gonna get him on the next few days
[02:54:51.940 --> 02:54:55.300]  he's saying he talked to his globalist source I know who it is
[02:54:55.300 --> 02:54:58.740]  and they're saying they're trying to trick Iran into responding and Iran's
[02:54:58.740 --> 02:55:01.300]  now saying they might block the Strait of Hormuz
[02:55:01.300 --> 02:55:04.420]  or something that's falling right into the trap and I know it's hard for a
[02:55:04.420 --> 02:55:08.100]  country to take all this but we do not want this new war
[02:55:08.100 --> 02:55:11.460]  but the globalist needed is a political distraction here's another one
[02:55:11.460 --> 02:55:17.060]  Jerusalem post in battle to sod may start conflict with Israel
[02:55:17.060 --> 02:55:21.380]  they're going to report to the real possibility Israel's massage chief says
[02:55:21.380 --> 02:55:25.460]  that Assad will try to engage Israel's military in order to deflect attention
[02:55:25.460 --> 02:55:28.820]  for massacre oh you mean governments launch wars
[02:55:28.820 --> 02:55:33.540]  for political purposes to distract that the shoe goes on the other foot for
[02:55:33.540 --> 02:55:38.100]  Netanyahu wanting to launch this thing with Iran
[02:55:38.100 --> 02:55:41.780]  just like jumping into a bear trap Israel's going to be attacked on every
[02:55:41.780 --> 02:55:44.260]  side then the United States is going to be drug
[02:55:44.260 --> 02:55:47.860]  in and then there'll be terror attacks whether they're real or manufactured
[02:55:47.860 --> 02:55:51.140]  you can see where this is going that'll be a nice political diversion
[02:55:51.140 --> 02:55:55.380]  while the bankers rob us foreign affairs and defense committee chairman
[02:55:55.380 --> 02:56:00.580]  Saul Mo Fahs warned Monday I've been pronouncing that right that the
[02:56:00.580 --> 02:56:04.260]  duress which Syrian president Assad finds himself could
[02:56:04.260 --> 02:56:07.300]  soon lead to an armed conflict between Syria and Israel
[02:56:07.300 --> 02:56:10.660]  the closer the Assad regime in Syria gets to the death door the bigger the
[02:56:10.660 --> 02:56:14.980]  threat against Israel becomes now he went on to tell army radio and that's
[02:56:14.980 --> 02:56:17.220]  true
[02:56:17.460 --> 02:56:22.420]  they are the globalists are really trying to destabilize that whole area
[02:56:23.140 --> 02:56:29.140]  here's another one's mysterious blast slaying suggest covert efforts in Iran
[02:56:29.140 --> 02:56:32.100]  bush launched them five years ago i've been talking about it ever since
[02:56:32.100 --> 02:56:35.460]  it's like if the if the government doesn't admit something the media is so
[02:56:35.460 --> 02:56:39.060]  stupid they can't even get the press release bush put out at the white house
[02:56:39.060 --> 02:56:41.940]  five years ago i should have my writers write another
[02:56:41.940 --> 02:56:46.340]  article about it just because the morons in mainstream media either
[02:56:46.340 --> 02:56:48.980]  don't know or aren't allowed to report it to people
[02:56:48.980 --> 02:56:52.180]  gee i wonder if all these big explosions at military bases or
[02:56:52.180 --> 02:56:55.540]  some kind of covert strikes gee i wonder if all these leaders getting
[02:56:55.540 --> 02:56:59.220]  assassinated is an operation
[02:57:00.980 --> 02:57:05.540]  us official says no sign i ran shot down drone that was Reuters a few days ago
[02:57:05.540 --> 02:57:10.260]  but now this is out today fox news us military sources i ran has missing
[02:57:10.260 --> 02:57:14.740]  drones some 60 some six million dollar 90 foot wingspan
[02:57:14.740 --> 02:57:17.940]  giant drone who knows that things even drop in
[02:57:17.940 --> 02:57:20.340]  bombs
[02:57:21.140 --> 02:57:23.940]  and again why doesn't iran want to admit all this because it makes them look
[02:57:23.940 --> 02:57:27.220]  weak they're public we get really mad if
[02:57:27.220 --> 02:57:31.060]  they sit there and take these attacks as a report here they're going to be
[02:57:31.060 --> 02:57:34.020]  exporting more of our gasoline out of the country right as
[02:57:34.020 --> 02:57:37.860]  quantities go down that's some of the key news there i didn't even really get
[02:57:37.860 --> 02:57:40.420]  into all this financial news this is so important
[02:57:40.420 --> 02:57:44.180]  fed may give loans to imf to help eurozone
[02:57:44.180 --> 02:57:47.700]  again they've already given them loans it's their subsidiary so they're not
[02:57:47.700 --> 02:57:52.340]  giving a group loans it's a total scam the loans are at zero percent
[02:57:52.340 --> 02:57:56.340]  interest they loan it out so it's free money
[02:57:56.340 --> 02:58:00.260]  continuing here there's reports the fed to fund imf bypassing congressional
[02:58:00.260 --> 02:58:04.420]  refusal on european bailout
[02:58:04.420 --> 02:58:07.460]  murcosi
[02:58:07.460 --> 02:58:11.380]  they're now combining the names of murkel and sarcosi
[02:58:11.380 --> 02:58:14.580]  under pressure to agree to budget master plan
[02:58:14.580 --> 02:58:18.980]  and the agreement on the bailout of europe is the transfer of all sovereignty
[02:58:18.980 --> 02:58:22.340]  and power to the private megabanks incredible news there
[02:58:22.340 --> 02:58:26.020]  genrich favors juries but not for americans just for illegal aliens
[02:58:26.020 --> 02:58:28.740]  then want you to have juries but once illegal aliens to have them
[02:58:28.740 --> 02:58:32.100]  can't make this up donald trump again this mrs ron paul's a joke
[02:58:32.100 --> 02:58:36.100]  donald trump is a casino owning thug joke

[03:00:38.180 --> 03:00:41.540]  for uh for connecticut a little different title for military
[03:00:41.540 --> 03:00:45.460]  but i'm just giving basically a little bit of an update as to what's going on
[03:00:45.460 --> 03:00:49.540]  here particularly between massachusetts and connecticut
[03:00:49.540 --> 03:00:52.580]  uh we're having actually some congressmen here that we contacted
[03:00:52.580 --> 03:00:55.860]  recently there uh i think it's john larson
[03:00:55.860 --> 03:00:58.980]  sean williams they're going to try and jump on this to try and get this uh
[03:00:58.980 --> 03:01:04.420]  bill shot down um but then again there we also see um
[03:01:04.420 --> 03:01:07.620]  we're also starting to see the occupy harford movement
[03:01:07.620 --> 03:01:10.740]  i mean connecticut's starting to wake up pretty fast between there and mass
[03:01:10.740 --> 03:01:15.940] achusetts but um yeah we're trying to get our officers on board as to
[03:01:15.940 --> 03:01:19.540]  what this this act and enables and say that goes back to again what the guys
[03:01:19.540 --> 03:01:22.900]  were saying earlier on it's like if you're gonna
[03:01:22.900 --> 03:01:26.820]  take an oath you know defend it i mean it says in the way states
[03:01:26.820 --> 03:01:31.220]  defend your constitution of oath from enemies both foreign and domestic
[03:01:31.220 --> 03:01:34.420]  and i'm just sitting here waiting because we had a petition online at
[03:01:34.420 --> 03:01:38.500]  whitehouse.gov and obviously that takes about 25 days to go through
[03:01:38.500 --> 03:01:41.940]  before obama would sign it and i'm sitting here thinking to myself
[03:01:41.940 --> 03:01:46.020]  well in the bill itself it says that it's 60 days active after the president
[03:01:46.020 --> 03:01:49.220]  signs it and we're we're all just discussing this here now
[03:01:49.220 --> 03:01:52.740]  it's like should we just take off our uniforms
[03:01:52.820 --> 03:01:56.580]  i mean how do you defend yourself from that well it's good to have
[03:01:56.580 --> 03:02:00.100]  good people inside the military inside the police will speak out so i wouldn't
[03:02:00.100 --> 03:02:02.900]  do that i would point out this is illegitimate
[03:02:02.900 --> 03:02:08.260]  the government could pass laws saying blonde hair blue eyed people have to
[03:02:08.260 --> 03:02:11.620]  you know go to prison or black people have to it's all illegal
[03:02:11.620 --> 03:02:15.300]  good points cori good to hear from you i'm going to go to a joseph former
[03:02:15.300 --> 03:02:20.100]  military in texas listening on xm channel 166 Joseph thanks for holding
[03:02:20.100 --> 03:02:25.620]  welcome alex hi i uh purchased quite a few times
[03:02:25.620 --> 03:02:29.620]  played on george norris program and last night too but
[03:02:29.620 --> 03:02:33.700]  i uh been out on the road for most since oh two and
[03:02:33.700 --> 03:02:39.060]  have the opportunity to take of that venue on a regular basis
[03:02:39.060 --> 03:02:44.100]  uh the individual called in earlier uh military think it's marine but
[03:02:44.100 --> 03:02:48.980]  was talking about uh things that happened in iraq like
[03:02:48.980 --> 03:02:53.780]  dragging uh civilians or well dragging i know they're civilians not
[03:02:53.780 --> 03:03:00.740]  dragging families in homes uh also well i was in germany
[03:03:00.740 --> 03:03:06.420]  and i know as an mp uh i was once invited to go into a detention
[03:03:06.420 --> 03:03:12.180]  cell and uh beat a prisoner with clubs and i simply
[03:03:12.180 --> 03:03:17.700]  refused to do it and i went outside couldn't stop it but i refused to i
[03:03:17.700 --> 03:03:23.540]  refused to participate uh you do have a choice
[03:03:23.540 --> 03:03:28.260]  i mean i granted there's kind of a gray area as far as what constitutes a legal
[03:03:28.260 --> 03:03:34.820]  order versus a legal order but you do have a choice
[03:03:34.820 --> 03:03:38.820]  um you don't just have to obey orders blindly
[03:03:38.820 --> 03:03:43.220]  uh and you don't just have to go along with things that are wrong
[03:03:43.220 --> 03:03:46.820]  that's right and it's not just your right it's your duty great points

[03:03:58.580 --> 03:04:02.900]  the marines in 1997 um there's a misconception that americans have
[03:04:02.900 --> 03:04:05.860]  about uh foreigners coming over here you know the illegal
[03:04:05.860 --> 03:04:09.780]  aliens uh people have been coming to this country
[03:04:09.780 --> 03:04:13.140]  was formed by by people coming from some world because they wanted to no i
[03:04:13.140 --> 03:04:16.660]  totally understand that it's that now the numbers are greater than they've
