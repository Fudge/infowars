[00:00:04.997 --> 00:00:09.840]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:11.421]  You want answers?
[00:00:11.421 --> 00:00:12.962]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:12.962 --> 00:00:17.165]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.165 --> 00:00:21.207]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:25.911 --> 00:00:31.372]  It is the 25th day of March 2013 on this Monday edition.
[00:00:31.372 --> 00:00:37.773]  I am your host, Alex Jones, and we are going to be live here for the next three hours.
[00:00:37.773 --> 00:00:48.616]  I've been watching cable, so-called television news, listening to local radio with syndicated news, and they're announcing, hey, Cyprus got the help they needed.
[00:00:48.616 --> 00:00:53.877]  The EU and central banks came to their aid, and they got a bailout.
[00:00:53.877 --> 00:00:54.557]  Aren't they lucky?
[00:00:55.245 --> 00:01:00.870]  Not, oh, they're rioting all over the country and burning things down, and, oh, there's a compromise.
[00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:14.443]  The top 40% will have 10% or more taken out of their bank account, and that's causing investment to flee the country, which causes it to implode further, so the globalists can come in and buy it up for pennies on the dollar.
[00:01:14.443 --> 00:01:16.485]  No, nowhere in our news
[00:01:17.739 --> 00:01:39.040]  Nowhere that I could see on television news, as I made a point of watching some of it to see if it was taking place, in financial news, on CNBC, on Fox News Radio, nowhere now are they talking about taking money out of people's bank accounts and that it's being transferred to the EU to prop up derivatives.
[00:01:41.303 --> 00:01:50.095]  It is just absolutely incredible that Iceland and Greece and all these other countries, 90 plus percent of their debt is not their debt.
[00:01:50.095 --> 00:01:52.659]  They've been signed on to this system.
[00:01:52.659 --> 00:01:56.244]  They've been signed on to all of the different derivatives.
[00:01:56.244 --> 00:01:57.485]  And it's the same thing here.
[00:01:58.564 --> 00:01:59.485]  And that's what's going on.
[00:01:59.485 --> 00:02:00.205]  That's what's happening.
[00:02:00.205 --> 00:02:04.908]  We've got a big stack of news on that front that we're going to be covering.
[00:02:04.908 --> 00:02:13.133]  We've also got Boris Barabosky, the big anti-Putin guy, found dead in his bathroom.
[00:02:13.133 --> 00:02:15.555]  And the police just instantly said it's natural causes.
[00:02:15.555 --> 00:02:16.896]  No autopsy needed.
[00:02:16.896 --> 00:02:18.317]  That's when you know something's suspicious.
[00:02:19.275 --> 00:02:26.559]  Because it takes bare minimum of a week or so to get an autopsy properly done and all the toxicology exams back.
[00:02:26.559 --> 00:02:37.525]  When you instantly, within hours, or in Breitbart, 45 minutes, I checked the time, about 45 minutes, they're saying nothing to worry about, not foul play, heart attack, heart attack.
[00:02:37.525 --> 00:02:42.588]  As soon as you hear that, I mean this guy had a scarf lying beside him, he could leave the murder weapon.
[00:02:43.792 --> 00:02:46.415]  And he'd said that Putin was after him.
[00:02:46.415 --> 00:02:52.260]  But it could have been another globalist faction killing him to steal the tens of billions he had ferreted away and hid in different places.
[00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:53.781]  We're going to be breaking that down.
[00:02:53.781 --> 00:02:57.184]  And now it's one of the biggest stories in the country.
[00:02:57.184 --> 00:03:01.428]  It's up at DrugsReport.com, the big top link right now.
[00:03:02.469 --> 00:03:03.929]  You're listening in rebroadcast later.
[00:03:03.929 --> 00:03:10.070]  It may have scrolled down the page or you can always find it at InfoWars.com.
[00:03:10.070 --> 00:03:21.132]  360,000 more rounds on top of the two plus billion and 15 members of Congress have now asked to see details and have been told to basically go fly a kite, jump in the lake.
[00:03:21.132 --> 00:03:23.473]  Well, that's a nice way to put it.
[00:03:23.473 --> 00:03:27.333]  And so this arms buildup, they say there are no armored vehicles, there are no bullets.
[00:03:27.333 --> 00:03:28.593]  And in fact, they're in U.S.
[00:03:28.593 --> 00:03:31.154]  News & World Report denying bullet purchases.
[00:03:32.068 --> 00:03:38.213]  In fact, that's the headline out of U.S.
[00:03:38.213 --> 00:03:50.945]  News and World Report, is that there just are no bullet purchases, and so we should all just move along.
[00:03:50.945 --> 00:03:55.709]  The point is, there's a total paramilitary buildup against the American people.
[00:03:55.709 --> 00:03:58.571]  And by the way, I am for gun control.
[00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:10.564]  I don't think government should be deploying tanks and armored vehicles and checkpoints and heavy machine guns and drones while saying they want our guns.
[00:04:10.564 --> 00:04:14.065]  So yes, you've got all these government abuses throughout history.
[00:04:14.065 --> 00:04:17.306]  You've got this government abusing people over and over again.
[00:04:17.306 --> 00:04:22.148]  Isn't it time to talk about government-sensible, reasonable gun control?
[00:04:22.788 --> 00:04:26.149]  Because the Austin police chief says, ban gun shows basically.
[00:04:26.149 --> 00:04:28.170]  Don't allow private transfers.
[00:04:28.170 --> 00:04:29.990]  Can't buy your grandson a gun.
[00:04:29.990 --> 00:04:31.051]  Basically registration.
[00:04:31.051 --> 00:04:33.271]  He's up there testifying in Congress.
[00:04:33.271 --> 00:04:35.552]  I guess his communist training in Cuba is coming through.
[00:04:35.552 --> 00:04:38.113]  He swears he's not a communist and loves liberty.
[00:04:38.113 --> 00:04:40.614]  That's pretty authoritarian, Art Acevedo.
[00:04:42.214 --> 00:04:49.296]  But he was up there, you know, with the Clintonistas and the Obamanoids calling for that and saying you don't need a semi-auto to protect yourself.
[00:04:49.296 --> 00:04:56.999]  Well then, Copstone, I want the police to turn their semi-autos in right now if we don't need them to defend ourselves.
[00:04:56.999 --> 00:04:57.979]  They don't either.
[00:05:00.876 --> 00:05:04.662]  If you're listening, you know your basic freedoms are being threatened every day.
[00:05:04.662 --> 00:05:07.906]  If you're listening, you know the economy is not getting better.
[00:05:07.906 --> 00:05:10.710]  You know gas and food prices are skyrocketing.
[00:05:10.710 --> 00:05:12.853]  Now is the time to get prepared.
[00:05:12.853 --> 00:05:15.818]  For years we've told you about our friends at eFoods Direct.

[00:08:03.391 --> 00:08:08.361]  Defending the Republic from enemies foreign and domestic.
[00:08:08.361 --> 00:08:09.905]  It's Alex Jones!
[00:08:24.580 --> 00:08:29.685]  It is Monday, the 25th day of March 2013.
[00:08:29.685 --> 00:08:31.847]  I am your host, Alex Jones.
[00:08:31.847 --> 00:08:34.529]  We're going to be here live for the next three hours.
[00:08:34.529 --> 00:08:36.071]  Again, thank you so much for joining us.
[00:08:37.406 --> 00:09:00.562]  Well, you've got a global cartel of private banks that have taken over Europe, taken over the United States, and most of the world now, and they're openly saying that we need to not be able to take a hot bath or hot shower under the UN regulations, and that we need to not have a car, and that we're using too much energy, and that we need to live in 250 square foot apartments
[00:09:03.084 --> 00:09:14.808]  And they're saying all over the US and Europe they're going to raise taxes to the point of where you have to live in a 250 square foot apartment or it's impossible to pay the taxes.
[00:09:14.808 --> 00:09:19.070]  That's that's going in in San Francisco, New York, Germany's doing it countrywide.
[00:09:20.050 --> 00:09:36.004]  It's all part of the United Nations Industrial Development Organization plan and treaties and agreements from the 50s, 60s, and 70s that are the root of Agenda 21 codified into world government regulatory law in 1992 in Rio de Janeiro.
[00:09:41.463 --> 00:09:44.164]  And this is why they are raising the taxes.
[00:09:44.164 --> 00:09:53.846]  This is why they are creating regulations that make it impossible to have a new business operate successfully, especially in manufacturing in the West.
[00:09:53.846 --> 00:09:56.847]  They're now going to shut down the service industry as well.
[00:09:56.847 --> 00:10:09.190]  They want you totally bankrupted so that you will then have to comply in the social engineering to the government jobs and the select globalist corporate jobs that are able to hire because they are exempt
[00:10:09.710 --> 00:10:16.315]  from all of the regulations, the carbon regulations, the offshoring regulations, all of it.
[00:10:16.315 --> 00:10:19.538]  This is the planned deindustrialization.
[00:10:19.538 --> 00:10:29.867]  And then if you dare try to operate oil refineries or coal mining operations or steel production in the United States, Europe, England, Australia, New Zealand, Canada, you name it,
[00:10:30.737 --> 00:10:36.162]  You will be assaulted and sued, as Obama promised to do, quote, to bankrupt coal.
[00:10:36.162 --> 00:10:53.358]  If you ever wonder why you hear such demonization of the Koch brothers, it's because they are some of the biggest factory owners in the United States, and because they are the biggest coal mining and refining outfit in the United States, and they keep the lights on.
[00:10:53.939 --> 00:10:56.581]  Do I romanticize that and think they're angels?
[00:10:56.581 --> 00:10:57.922]  Not particularly.
[00:10:57.922 --> 00:11:04.426]  I've spent months off and on as of late trying to dig up some dirt on them that isn't manufactured or fake.
[00:11:04.426 --> 00:11:11.671]  And about the worst thing I can find is something that all major oil companies, supply companies have been done because loopholes were written.
[00:11:11.671 --> 00:11:18.155]  They've sold equipment, oil refining equipment to Iran during those decades-long sanctions.
[00:11:18.931 --> 00:11:29.017]  And the only reason I just went off to the Koch Brothers is I'm starting the broadcast describing why the government wants to shut things down and destroy society.
[00:11:29.017 --> 00:11:33.960]  Because it's a globalist program where they are exempt from everything and they shut you down.
[00:11:33.960 --> 00:11:43.926]  They bomb third world countries under flimsy pretexts and blow up their chemical plants, their water plants, their power plants, their roads, their bridges.
[00:11:43.926 --> 00:11:46.108]  Here they don't blow them up, they just shut them down.
[00:11:47.233 --> 00:11:54.858]  I had a fellow last Friday, I was in a restaurant with my family and he walked over and he said, you know, I want to thank you for what you've done.
[00:11:54.858 --> 00:11:57.640]  You know, I've worked in Austin Energy.
[00:11:57.640 --> 00:12:03.783]  And he said, you know, they've shut down our two power plants, clean burning, modern, and they're shutting down the third one.
[00:12:03.783 --> 00:12:04.624]  And he goes, you're right.
[00:12:04.624 --> 00:12:07.286]  It's doubled prices the last five years and they're going to double again.
[00:12:08.274 --> 00:12:13.359]  He goes, my God, it's, it's, and the public's so dumb, they don't even know why their power bills doubled.
[00:12:13.359 --> 00:12:16.401]  He goes, I just, the guy was just so intense.
[00:12:16.401 --> 00:12:17.742]  And he was just, I want to thank you.
[00:12:17.742 --> 00:12:20.105]  And we try to do the best we can as well.
[00:12:20.105 --> 00:12:23.408]  And, you know, most of us have also been laid off and, you know, let go.
[00:12:26.749 --> 00:12:28.891]  And I'm like, I guess you can go to work for General Electric.
[00:12:28.891 --> 00:12:30.131]  They're exempt from all the rules.
[00:12:30.131 --> 00:12:32.093]  They can have dirty burning, you name it.
[00:12:32.093 --> 00:12:37.317]  All that comes out of these modern plants the last 25 years is water vapor and carbon dioxide.
[00:12:37.317 --> 00:12:39.719]  So they list carbon dioxide as a pollutant.
[00:12:39.719 --> 00:12:42.200]  GMO is not a pollutant.
[00:12:42.200 --> 00:12:43.601]  Overfishing is not an issue.
[00:12:43.601 --> 00:12:46.023]  I mean, there are hundreds of real environmental issues.
[00:12:46.023 --> 00:12:49.706]  The globalists say they care about the environment, but it's the opposite.
[00:12:52.111 --> 00:13:05.536]  The reason I mention the Koch Brothers before I get into all this huge news today is I constantly see this fake meme that I work for the Koch Brothers, that I'm funded by the Koch Brothers, that I sure wish I was.
[00:13:05.536 --> 00:13:18.461]  I don't have one stock or one bond or one dime that I get or anybody, I mean my wife, children, any of them get from coal, oil, distillates, anything.
[00:13:18.461 --> 00:13:19.302]  I have no stocks.
[00:13:19.302 --> 00:13:20.062]  I have no bonds.
[00:13:21.198 --> 00:13:32.208]  I take the money that I make off my syndicated radio show, it's the big breadwinner for this whole news operation, and plow it into crew and research and equipment.
[00:13:32.208 --> 00:13:45.540]  But it doesn't matter that they have Media Matters and Mother Jones and all these fake liberal groups out there implying anyone that is pro-Second Amendment, anyone that's pro-U.S.
[00:13:45.540 --> 00:13:45.881]  energy,
[00:13:48.069 --> 00:13:53.194]  Works for the Koch Brothers, and then it's like, oh my gosh, that's so evil.
[00:13:53.194 --> 00:14:00.561]  When it's the Enron people that came up with the carbon tax plan, with Al Gore on record, and it's a plan.
[00:14:00.561 --> 00:14:04.685]  I mean, Al Gore is the majority owner of Occidental Petroleum.
[00:14:04.685 --> 00:14:08.329]  Al Gore has got tens of billions in offshore accounts.
[00:14:10.977 --> 00:14:13.920]  And again, I think we should have moved away from oil.
[00:14:13.920 --> 00:14:19.346]  I know there's monopolies on the carburetors and things, and they try to block new energy development.
[00:14:19.346 --> 00:14:22.009]  And the new energy development we're getting is a fraud.
[00:14:22.009 --> 00:14:28.255]  But the point is, the globalists are shutting down our industry and shutting down our coal, mainly because big oil wants that.
[00:14:28.996 --> 00:14:34.120]  While at the same time, not letting us have new things that actually empower us.
[00:14:34.120 --> 00:14:38.403]  I mean, they won't give you a tax credit to put off the grid solar or wind in.
[00:14:38.403 --> 00:14:45.108]  In fact, they'll harass you in most areas, especially if they're, quote, liberal, to not give you a permit.
[00:14:45.108 --> 00:14:46.749]  Or they'll say, what's that windmill doing?
[00:14:46.749 --> 00:14:47.950]  What's that solar array?
[00:14:47.950 --> 00:14:50.072]  And come harass you.
[00:14:50.072 --> 00:14:52.373]  So it's not Koch Brothers good guys.
[00:14:53.450 --> 00:14:55.011]  Everybody else bad guys.
[00:14:55.011 --> 00:14:59.913]  It's just that I've been constantly accused of working for the Koch brothers with no evidence.
[00:14:59.913 --> 00:15:05.895]  And then so I go and I think, you know, I say, well, let me really research the Koch brothers.
[00:15:05.895 --> 00:15:09.517]  And so it becomes kind of a little pet project as I do in research.
[00:15:09.517 --> 00:15:10.297]  And I discovered.
[00:15:12.037 --> 00:15:14.700]  That they're anti-Agenda 21.
[00:15:14.700 --> 00:15:21.888]  They have, quote, secret meetings with conservative leaders and they sneak out the audio and it's, how do we defend the Second Amendment?
[00:15:21.888 --> 00:15:24.410]  How do we defend the family?
[00:15:24.410 --> 00:15:26.913]  How do we keep America competitive?
[00:15:26.913 --> 00:15:28.555]  How do we reverse offshoring?
[00:15:31.647 --> 00:15:32.808]  I mean, you can go to the Brad blog.
[00:15:32.808 --> 00:15:33.669]  We've had that gone before.
[00:15:33.669 --> 00:15:42.058]  You know, we've got the quote, secret recordings of years ago with the Republican, uh, you know, Libertarian powwow with Judge Napolitano as the keynote speaker.
[00:15:42.058 --> 00:15:43.400]  Oh my goodness, the evil.
[00:15:44.580 --> 00:15:48.663]  And the whole thing's about we must defend the Second Amendment, the family and property rights.
[00:15:48.663 --> 00:15:54.688]  You know, there are collectivist mega-rich who want to shut down all the nouveau riche and independent rich.
[00:15:54.688 --> 00:15:56.209]  I mean, that's what's going on at these meetings.
[00:15:56.209 --> 00:16:02.233]  What did the head of the Dallas Fed and the head of the Kansas City Fed come out last week and say?
[00:16:02.233 --> 00:16:11.320]  They said, crony elite mega-banks are going to shut down all the other free market and create a consolidation and destroy our economic future.
[00:16:11.980 --> 00:16:16.606]  Even MIT came out a few months ago and said, we will never re-industrialize.
[00:16:16.606 --> 00:16:22.353]  We are in a total emergency situation.
[00:16:22.353 --> 00:16:25.377]  That is the kind of stuff that we are talking about here.
[00:16:26.809 --> 00:16:35.511]  And so, thank God I've been accused for working for the Koch brothers, because it made me actually go research them and find out what they're up to and what they're doing.
[00:16:35.511 --> 00:16:42.213]  A private family, the second largest private corporation in the country, that hasn't merged into tax-free foundations.
[00:16:42.213 --> 00:16:45.973]  They go to some globalist meetings to protect their interests, obviously.
[00:16:45.973 --> 00:16:49.834]  And then they're horrible because they're having secret meetings in Colorado.
[00:16:49.834 --> 00:16:51.995]  Not really secret, they're just not open to the public.
[00:16:52.435 --> 00:17:02.399]  And hours of it gets released, and it's the government wants to destroy the family, the government wants to take our guns, the government's run by authoritarian megacorporations that aren't free market.
[00:17:02.399 --> 00:17:08.921]  Oh my gosh, how do we, the independent wealthy, defend freedom?
[00:17:08.921 --> 00:17:14.944]  Oh my gosh, can you imagine the evil level of this?
[00:17:16.403 --> 00:17:19.806]  So I'm going to do a report on the Koch Brothers as soon as I get time.
[00:17:19.806 --> 00:17:25.751]  I've got, no exaggeration, about 100 reports partly done or almost completely done.
[00:17:25.751 --> 00:17:27.733]  I bought off more than I can shoot.
[00:17:27.733 --> 00:17:28.013]  Okay?
[00:17:28.013 --> 00:17:30.275]  I mean, there's so much I want to cover.
[00:17:30.275 --> 00:17:34.278]  In fact, I'm going to hook it up at my house now that I finally have good internet.
[00:17:34.278 --> 00:17:36.580]  Finally got some good internet.
[00:17:36.580 --> 00:17:41.064]  I want to set up, guys, with my IT guys, where I could just go in and hit one button.
[00:17:41.966 --> 00:17:50.838]  And take over the refeeds on the audio feeds or create podcasts that I hit a button, record it, you know, very simple.
[00:17:50.838 --> 00:17:52.520]  I mean, I know how to upload stuff to YouTube and things.
[00:17:52.520 --> 00:17:56.145]  So the point is, so I can just when I'm really brainstorming at two in the morning.
[00:17:56.906 --> 00:18:04.568]  I'm tempted to just have like a room I walk into that I just hit a button and I'm on TV and there's video feeds because that's when I have my brainstorms.
[00:18:04.568 --> 00:18:10.590]  When I'm here on the radio, there's just so much to cover and ads and guests coming up and we still cover a lot of important things.
[00:18:10.590 --> 00:18:11.831]  It's just that I want to do more.
[00:18:12.765 --> 00:18:18.188]  And it's just so many times that you see me doing these what listeners call underwear uploads.
[00:18:18.188 --> 00:18:26.973]  Because sometimes I'll be shirtless shooting video of all that's on the computer screen and people can see that I'm not wearing a shirt occasionally.
[00:18:26.973 --> 00:18:33.557]  So it's what's been affectionately dubbed the underwear special reports.
[00:18:33.557 --> 00:18:36.359]  But I mean, I'm just desperate to get this info out.
[00:18:36.359 --> 00:18:38.120]  I know the Globalist plan.
[00:18:38.880 --> 00:18:55.845]  I have all the UN documents, like United Nations Industrial Development Organization, founded in the 1950s, to shut down Western industrial systems, and actually shut down the third world as well, only allow globalist combines to operate.
[00:18:55.845 --> 00:18:59.506]  I mean, I know their whole battle plan, and I know what they're up to.
[00:19:02.915 --> 00:19:16.635]  We are just in so much trouble, ladies and gentlemen, because the mainline Republicans are controlled by the globalists, the Democrats are kind of the vanguard to lead us into the collectivism, and it's collectivism to have full government control over us.
[00:19:16.635 --> 00:19:18.357]  So it's a very nightmarish prospect.
[00:19:18.357 --> 00:19:19.178]  Now, when we come back,
[00:19:19.739 --> 00:19:25.809]  Retired Army Captain Warns DHS Acquisitions Are Bold Threat Of War Against The American People.
[00:19:25.809 --> 00:19:29.414]  Says Americans Have To Prepare To Defend Themselves And The U.S.
[00:19:29.414 --> 00:19:34.182]  Constitution Against The Obama Administration Coup Against The American People.
[00:19:35.463 --> 00:19:36.664]  DHS in U.S.
[00:19:36.664 --> 00:19:40.106]  News & World Report outright denies any bullet purchases.
[00:19:40.106 --> 00:19:42.628]  DHS denies massive ammunition purchases.
[00:19:42.628 --> 00:19:44.169]  There you go, not happening.
[00:19:44.169 --> 00:19:45.370]  Even though it's all public.
[00:19:45.370 --> 00:19:49.572]  Big Sis orders 360,000 rounds more on top of the 2 billion.
[00:19:49.572 --> 00:19:51.593]  That's top story up at DrugsReport.com.
[00:19:51.593 --> 00:19:56.517]  And we're going to get into the incredible Cyprus deal.
[00:19:56.517 --> 00:19:59.478]  40% of bank accounts to be looted.
[00:19:59.478 --> 00:19:59.979]  Stay with us.
[00:20:01.351 --> 00:20:07.198]  Now that we have moved into the winter season, there is an increased need to support our immunity and health.

[00:22:29.298 --> 00:22:30.539]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[00:22:30.539 --> 00:22:35.122]  Have you ever wondered why banks, stockbrokers, investment advisors won't talk about gold IRAs?
[00:22:35.122 --> 00:22:40.926]  They've been available since 1986, yet the financial industry won't recognize the value of gold for your retirement.
[00:22:40.926 --> 00:22:44.568]  Gold has outperformed paper investments, yet no word about IRAs.
[00:22:44.568 --> 00:22:47.390]  If you would like to have gold for your retirement, call 800-686-2237.

[00:23:44.670 --> 00:23:45.130]  We're good.
[00:24:14.116 --> 00:24:19.840]  See, here's what's frustrating for me and the reason I talk so much about energy.
[00:24:19.840 --> 00:24:28.725]  The reason the United States has been so incredibly wealthy in the last hundred years is because we've had early energy development.
[00:24:28.725 --> 00:24:33.468]  We're not even that particularly energy rich compared to some areas, but we had early energy development.
[00:24:34.269 --> 00:24:36.110]  And we developed an early infrastructure.
[00:24:36.110 --> 00:24:42.632]  But have you noticed the last 30-40 years, no real infrastructure improvement except the compact megacities.
[00:24:42.632 --> 00:24:45.734]  And that's all official UN policy.
[00:24:46.724 --> 00:24:49.585]  And the Globalist made the deal to put Mao Zedong in in 1945.
[00:24:49.585 --> 00:24:53.026]  That's now been publicly declassified.
[00:24:53.026 --> 00:24:56.006]  Kudos to the John Birch Society exposing that in the 50s and 60s.
[00:24:56.006 --> 00:25:00.047]  And then people are like, oh yeah, right, our government put the red Chinese in.
[00:25:00.047 --> 00:25:00.848]  They did.
[00:25:00.848 --> 00:25:08.230]  They put Mao in, the greatest mass murderer in history, who's now in Department of Education, you know, children textbooks for 8-year-olds.
[00:25:08.230 --> 00:25:09.250]  That came out last week.
[00:25:10.205 --> 00:25:13.647]  Be like endorsing Hitler or something, but he even killed more than Hitler.
[00:25:13.647 --> 00:25:18.609]  And CJ, to show how informed my crew is, he goes, didn't they kill the Keystone Pipeline?
[00:25:18.609 --> 00:25:26.794]  Because that would have brought oil to the United States and mainly to Koch Brother refineries in Texas, in South Texas on the coast.
[00:25:26.794 --> 00:25:29.135]  And I said, bingo, that's absolutely true.
[00:25:29.135 --> 00:25:31.496]  And again, I don't have any interest.
[00:25:31.496 --> 00:25:33.377]  They don't pay me.
[00:25:33.377 --> 00:25:36.779]  I happen to know my power prices have doubled
[00:25:38.345 --> 00:25:48.933]  Just on electricity in Central Texas in the last five years and it's in the newspaper that they've doubled because they shut down the two city-owned power plants.
[00:25:48.933 --> 00:25:53.656]  The third one in Fayetteville is now to be shut down next year.
[00:25:53.656 --> 00:25:54.777]  They're just shutting it down.
[00:25:56.013 --> 00:25:57.996]  A giant clean-burning power plant.
[00:25:57.996 --> 00:25:59.678]  The media shows the smoke coming out of it.
[00:25:59.678 --> 00:26:00.419]  It's water vapor.
[00:26:00.419 --> 00:26:02.281]  That's why it doesn't keep going.
[00:26:02.281 --> 00:26:05.806]  It's hot water and carbon dioxide and then it fades out.
[00:26:05.806 --> 00:26:07.148]  And you can say, well, that's still dirty.
[00:26:07.148 --> 00:26:10.012]  It still has byproducts that they use in steel.
[00:26:11.073 --> 00:26:12.635]  And plastics and other products.
[00:26:12.635 --> 00:26:14.016]  It has a lot of distillates.
[00:26:14.016 --> 00:26:27.187]  And you notice the Koch brothers were really smart because the founder of it was a genius engineer, the father of the brothers, who developed all these distillation programs in the 40s and 50s.
[00:26:27.187 --> 00:26:29.069]  And he had all these patents.
[00:26:29.069 --> 00:26:32.232]  And it was a genius who learned how to use all this stuff.
[00:26:32.232 --> 00:26:35.555]  So more I'd study the Koch brothers, I was just describing it.
[00:26:35.555 --> 00:26:36.716]  It's like they're the engine.
[00:26:37.938 --> 00:26:46.965]  In episode four, and the Star Destroyer is chasing the diplomatic frigate, and they're firing on it, and they blow the engine, and they tractor-beam it in.
[00:26:46.965 --> 00:26:49.707]  They blow the engine in this country, which they've basically done.
[00:26:49.707 --> 00:26:51.589]  It's smoking right now.
[00:26:51.589 --> 00:26:53.170]  Then it's going to totally implode.
[00:26:53.170 --> 00:26:56.352]  The globalists are going to buy everything up for pennies on the dollar.
[00:26:56.352 --> 00:26:57.973]  Our engine is basically already blown.
[00:26:57.973 --> 00:27:04.759]  I mean, they knew, and it's just, again, I said I'd get into all this other news, but I'm going to shoot a special report on this.
[00:27:06.221 --> 00:27:08.802]  Enemy bombers couldn't do what Obama's done.
[00:27:08.802 --> 00:27:16.763]  200 plus coal power plants, most of them brand new, manufactured, totally clean, shut down in four years.
[00:27:16.763 --> 00:27:21.904]  Now they're set to shut down a thousand more.
[00:27:21.904 --> 00:27:24.884]  And the public doesn't know why they get their power bill.
[00:27:24.884 --> 00:27:30.466]  I mean, my power bill used to be like $300 a month.
[00:27:30.466 --> 00:27:30.986]  Now it's like $1,500.
[00:27:30.986 --> 00:27:32.846]  I mean, that's more than double.
[00:27:34.738 --> 00:27:38.021]  I'm in a smaller house, and it's more.
[00:27:38.021 --> 00:27:40.983]  And it's just, it's destroying everybody!
[00:27:40.983 --> 00:27:48.370]  And they've got all these electric car people that get all the front parking spaces now, you know, at the grocery stores and things, because they're even better than the handicapped folks.
[00:27:48.370 --> 00:28:00.861]  And the idiots that come and plug in, they've done studies, it takes more fossil fuel to charge your car, to generate it, to create it in the power plants, to transfer it then to your car, than it does to use oil.
[00:28:03.365 --> 00:28:05.548]  And so they've shut down our coal power plants.
[00:28:05.548 --> 00:28:08.112]  They're set to shut down many fold that.
[00:28:08.112 --> 00:28:11.597]  And my interest is I'm watching my power price go up.
[00:28:11.597 --> 00:28:14.401]  And remember, China.
[00:28:14.401 --> 00:28:17.045]  Here's the thing about the Keystone Pipeline.
[00:28:17.045 --> 00:28:18.648]  America would have gotten that oil.
[00:28:19.830 --> 00:28:21.151]  The United States.
[00:28:21.151 --> 00:28:37.017]  Instead, even Bloomberg has to admit this, you can pull it up, Soros is the big winner, who owns the controlling interest in the big railway that is going to take all the tar sand oil to the west coast of Canada to be loaded on tankers and taken to China.
[00:28:37.017 --> 00:28:37.797]  And where is Soros?
[00:28:37.797 --> 00:28:39.057]  Mainly invested in China.
[00:28:39.057 --> 00:28:40.018]  Where is Maurice Strong?
[00:28:40.018 --> 00:28:41.258]  Where is David Rockefeller?
[00:28:41.258 --> 00:28:44.660]  They went to China, set them up, publicly opened them up in the mid-70s,
[00:28:46.488 --> 00:28:49.329]  And have moved all industry there with suicide nets.
[00:28:49.329 --> 00:28:58.951]  But notice, you'll never hear the left criticize Al Gore for, you know, wanting maximum profits out of Apple with Foxconn, where they're now just replacing the humans with robots altogether.
[00:28:58.951 --> 00:29:00.611]  They work them 18 hours a day.
[00:29:00.611 --> 00:29:01.912]  They're drugging them now.
[00:29:01.912 --> 00:29:04.752]  They have forced abortion, abortuary in the factory.
[00:29:04.752 --> 00:29:07.993]  Yeah, there's Forbes breaking it down.
[00:29:07.993 --> 00:29:10.534]  And you've got TransCanada.
[00:29:10.534 --> 00:29:15.835]  And you've got the, you've got the, the big railway company.
[00:29:18.436 --> 00:29:23.582]  Shutting down the pipeline to America.
[00:29:23.582 --> 00:29:26.385]  And you can see Mother Jones and everybody celebrating.
[00:29:26.385 --> 00:29:28.126]  Ding dong, the Kochs are dead.
[00:29:28.126 --> 00:29:29.067]  The Kochs, Kochs, Kochs.
[00:29:29.067 --> 00:29:30.108]  The Kochs, Kochs, Kochs.
[00:29:30.108 --> 00:29:35.194]  They won't get the oil that Communist Chinese will.
[00:29:35.194 --> 00:29:36.795]  And it's not even the people getting it.
[00:29:36.795 --> 00:29:37.797]  They get the oil.
[00:29:40.202 --> 00:29:41.523]  Yeah, Berkshire Hathaway.
[00:29:41.523 --> 00:29:45.704]  Yeah, don't forget, not just George Soros, but Warren Buffett.
[00:29:45.704 --> 00:29:46.505]  Holy Toledo.
[00:29:46.505 --> 00:29:47.465]  We'll be right back.
[00:29:47.465 --> 00:29:48.365]  That's what it's all about.
[00:29:48.365 --> 00:29:49.806]  Shutting down America.
[00:29:49.806 --> 00:29:51.187]  We're on the march.
[00:29:51.187 --> 00:29:53.728]  The empire's on the run.
[00:29:53.728 --> 00:29:56.369]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:00.794 --> 00:30:09.420]  The devastating events like earthquakes, tornadoes, floods, hurricanes, or the threat of martial law have highlighted the need for Americans to prepare for emergencies.
[00:30:09.420 --> 00:30:13.102]  As a result, millions are stockpiling food, gold, and weapons.
[00:30:13.102 --> 00:30:17.565]  But how will these items help if you or one of your loved ones becomes ill?
[00:30:17.565 --> 00:30:22.609]  Supernatural silver is the ultimate tool to prepare you for a medical emergency.
[00:30:22.609 --> 00:30:30.114]  Supernatural silver is a natural antibiotic that is uniquely effective against bacteria, viruses, moles, and fungus,
[00:30:30.794 --> 00:30:31.234]  I think so.
[00:31:00.979 --> 00:31:04.765]  If you're listening, you know your basic freedoms are being threatened every day.
[00:31:04.765 --> 00:31:08.010]  If you're listening, you know the economy is not getting better.
[00:31:08.010 --> 00:31:10.814]  You know gas and food prices are skyrocketing.
[00:31:10.814 --> 00:31:12.958]  Now is the time to get prepared.
[00:31:12.958 --> 00:31:15.802]  For years we've told you about our friends at eFoods Direct.
[00:31:17.739 --> 00:31:18.159]  I think so.

[00:33:02.432 --> 00:33:08.445]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center and the heart of the resistance.
[00:33:08.445 --> 00:33:11.010]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[00:33:25.145 --> 00:33:37.611]  You see, the globalists will create irrational fears in people over things that aren't really dangerous or overall bad, like citizens being armed.
[00:33:37.611 --> 00:33:51.699]  Oh my gosh, the idea of other citizens being armed is so frightening, but historically you should be concerned and frightened of a government that's armed to the teeth and engaged in domestic military operations, which is now happening.
[00:33:52.239 --> 00:33:59.965]  The Department of Homeland Security is a fifth branch of the military, beholden only to the President, not to Congress.
[00:33:59.965 --> 00:34:04.709]  And Congress is told, you will not see our DHS plans for civil unrest.
[00:34:04.709 --> 00:34:07.811]  You will not see the DHS plans on the billions of bullets.
[00:34:07.811 --> 00:34:12.595]  You will not see the Pentagon plans for military operations around the world.
[00:34:13.416 --> 00:34:15.297]  You are on the Armed Services Committee.
[00:34:15.297 --> 00:34:17.038]  You are on the Intelligence Committee.
[00:34:17.038 --> 00:34:18.519]  You hold the power of the purse.
[00:34:18.519 --> 00:34:20.140]  You declare the war.
[00:34:20.140 --> 00:34:22.221]  The President then executes.
[00:34:22.221 --> 00:34:24.802]  We're telling you that's all done.
[00:34:24.802 --> 00:34:32.747]  The office of the President is becoming a dictator because the office of the President is a corporate front position.
[00:34:32.747 --> 00:34:35.468]  One guy they've got to buy instead of 500 plus in Congress.
[00:34:37.823 --> 00:34:44.241]  One guy who can sit there and checkmate Congress and checkmate the states and checkmate the courts and checkmate it all.
[00:34:46.704 --> 00:34:48.546]  And that's what's happening.
[00:34:48.546 --> 00:34:53.730]  Foreign globalist interest, exempt from taxation worldwide, Warren Buffett.
[00:34:53.730 --> 00:34:55.211]  Oh, raise taxes on rich people.
[00:34:55.211 --> 00:35:00.095]  I've got too much money, using class envy, when he's exempt from the taxes offshore.
[00:35:00.095 --> 00:35:01.016]  Oh, I love you.
[00:35:01.016 --> 00:35:01.957]  I want you to do well.
[00:35:01.957 --> 00:35:02.917]  I'm Warren Buffett.
[00:35:02.917 --> 00:35:11.324]  That's why I lobbied and spent tens of millions of dollars per year in the last decade to block the construction of the Keystone Pipeline.
[00:35:11.324 --> 00:35:12.586]  And even though you got it built,
[00:35:13.430 --> 00:35:16.033]  You're not going to get that oil, America.
[00:35:16.033 --> 00:35:21.940]  It's going to go from me and George Soros to China, where we're invested.
[00:35:21.940 --> 00:35:23.101]  So they're going down.
[00:35:23.101 --> 00:35:24.984]  Imagine America as a breaker box.
[00:35:26.087 --> 00:35:51.948]  They're turning the breakers off, and it's very painful to see people, family, you know, veterans, people I've known my whole life, don't have money to drive to work now, you know, to see restaurants closing, businesses closing, roads rotting, just, but more cops, you can't swing a dead cat, not county, city, state, federal, armored vehicles, helicopters, checkpoints, oh yes, the signs of tyranny, as they just flip the switch,
[00:35:55.150 --> 00:36:01.075]  Just grabbing the switch.
[00:36:01.075 --> 00:36:02.956]  Just turning the lights out of America.
[00:36:02.956 --> 00:36:06.319]  It's like going down the life support, flipping off the switches.
[00:36:06.319 --> 00:36:09.121]  Click, click, click, click, click, click, click, click, click.
[00:36:09.121 --> 00:36:13.785]  And then I hear Koch brothers, demons, Koch brothers, the devil, Koch brothers, there's no one worse.
[00:36:13.785 --> 00:36:15.786]  Why they flay children alive.
[00:36:15.786 --> 00:36:17.528]  Alex Jones works for them.
[00:36:17.528 --> 00:36:19.089]  And I go, let me go check these guys out.
[00:36:19.369 --> 00:36:24.810]  I mean, sure, I know more than most people, being politically aware, but let me go make sure I know about these guys.
[00:36:24.810 --> 00:36:27.891]  So I spent the last few weeks, and I've got Aaron looking into them right now.
[00:36:27.891 --> 00:36:30.912]  We're going to do a whole report on the good, the bad, and the ugly of the Koch brothers.
[00:36:30.912 --> 00:36:36.233]  But then I come to the industrial fact that they are all that's left of the engine of America.
[00:36:36.233 --> 00:36:41.314]  And don't worry, so-called left authoritarians, that engine's going to get blown.
[00:36:41.314 --> 00:36:42.535]  I can see where everything's going.
[00:36:42.535 --> 00:36:44.055]  You're going to shut everything down.
[00:36:45.177 --> 00:36:45.938]  Okay?
[00:36:45.938 --> 00:36:47.258]  Don't worry.
[00:36:47.258 --> 00:36:49.320]  You'll defeat the Koch brothers.
[00:36:49.320 --> 00:36:51.241]  You'll destroy them.
[00:36:51.241 --> 00:36:51.841]  Don't worry.
[00:36:51.841 --> 00:36:53.502]  You didn't get that pipeline.
[00:36:53.502 --> 00:36:55.504]  China gets it.
[00:36:55.504 --> 00:36:57.305]  Okay?
[00:36:57.305 --> 00:36:58.826]  Don't worry.
[00:36:58.826 --> 00:36:59.526]  Don't worry.
[00:36:59.526 --> 00:37:05.010]  And go get your college education, which there's going to be no jobs for unless it's in Homeland Security.
[00:37:07.251 --> 00:37:08.851]  And by the way, the government wouldn't hurt us.
[00:37:08.851 --> 00:37:11.412]  Roll your sleeve up and take all the vaccines.
[00:37:11.412 --> 00:37:17.353]  Sure, there's thousands of admitted lethal secret tests that have been declassified on foster kids and U.S.
[00:37:17.353 --> 00:37:19.794]  military personnel and black people.
[00:37:19.794 --> 00:37:26.155]  Even a few years ago, testing pesticides on black kids, foster kids, taken by CPS in New York until they die.
[00:37:26.155 --> 00:37:30.916]  I mean, we need to turn our guns into a government like that.
[00:37:30.916 --> 00:37:31.716]  Okay, so, man.
[00:37:32.588 --> 00:37:38.730]  Let me tell you, I'm not worried about Foxconn and Apple with suicide nets and forced abortions.
[00:37:38.730 --> 00:37:39.751]  Okay?
[00:37:39.751 --> 00:37:41.532]  I mean, let me tell you, that's a good thing.
[00:37:41.532 --> 00:37:42.952]  That's liberal.
[00:37:42.952 --> 00:37:44.693]  But let me tell you, what is bad?
[00:37:44.693 --> 00:37:46.994]  The Koch brothers, ladies and gentlemen, lobby.
[00:37:47.924 --> 00:37:50.245]  And give money to pro-Second Amendment causes.
[00:37:50.245 --> 00:37:56.548]  Oh, yesterday I spent a couple hours listening to the secret recordings leaked from a 2011 meeting.
[00:37:56.548 --> 00:37:58.850]  You know, the Brad blog, I ought to get him on.
[00:37:58.850 --> 00:38:00.570]  I've had the guy on, actually, before on Election Friday.
[00:38:00.570 --> 00:38:03.332]  He's a pretty good guy, but I ought to have him on and go, yeah, Brad, this is terrible.
[00:38:03.332 --> 00:38:04.352]  Let's play some of these clips.
[00:38:04.352 --> 00:38:05.533]  We've got to protect the family?
[00:38:05.533 --> 00:38:09.215]  I mean, I'm glad I investigated, because I supposedly work for him.
[00:38:09.215 --> 00:38:09.915]  Oh my gosh!
[00:38:11.956 --> 00:38:19.457]  Speaker after speaker, we've got to defend private property and the new wealth that is the engine and not let the crony capitalists take over.
[00:38:19.457 --> 00:38:21.798]  I mean, look at that evil Fed chief in Dallas.
[00:38:21.798 --> 00:38:24.418]  Federal Reserve head of the Dallas Federal Reserve.
[00:38:24.418 --> 00:38:26.659]  That's the... Let's show them Reuters.
[00:38:26.659 --> 00:38:30.719]  Says crony capitalists have taken over and are going to shut down their competition.
[00:38:30.719 --> 00:38:32.340]  Oh, arrest him!
[00:38:32.340 --> 00:38:33.200]  He's bad too.
[00:38:33.200 --> 00:38:38.101]  See, when the Koch brothers do a few good things, I'm not saying they're perfect because I'm doing deep research on them.
[00:38:38.101 --> 00:38:39.461]  I'm finding some stuff, obviously.
[00:38:42.361 --> 00:38:49.183]  And when the Dallas Fed, I mean, I had Dr. Paul Gerhardt Roberts on Friday, I said, are they doing that because they know things are about to implode and they don't want to be blamed?
[00:38:49.183 --> 00:38:52.464]  And Roberts was like, no, they realize America's finished.
[00:38:52.464 --> 00:38:56.285]  And there's Feds Fisher, too big to fail banks or crony capitalists, Reuters.
[00:38:56.285 --> 00:38:57.446]  I guess he's bad.
[00:38:57.446 --> 00:38:57.886]  You know what?
[00:38:57.886 --> 00:38:59.967]  And they're actually attacking him.
[00:38:59.967 --> 00:39:02.247]  He's the bad guy because he's telling the truth.
[00:39:02.247 --> 00:39:03.728]  See, I'm starting to figure this out.
[00:39:03.728 --> 00:39:08.229]  When sane people, even in the power structure, go, you know what?
[00:39:08.229 --> 00:39:10.590]  There's these offshore mega banks that are so powerful.
[00:39:11.581 --> 00:39:15.769]  What about the Koch brothers, collectively with like 40-something billion bucks?
[00:39:15.769 --> 00:39:20.459]  And I mean literally thousands of factories in the U.S.
[00:39:21.533 --> 00:39:42.845]  You know, The Globalist, it came out, AP did a lawsuit back in 2000, got documents, where the big 10 oil companies met, and you can look these up, I've done reports on them, but just look them up, and met in 95 and 96 to create an artificial scarcity in oil, and they tried to buy up all of the privately owned refineries, or have regulators shut them down to create an artificial bottleneck to rape you.
[00:39:42.845 --> 00:39:43.885]  That's big oil.
[00:39:43.885 --> 00:39:48.228]  Queen Beatrix, Queen of England, who owned Dutch Rochelle, British Petroleum,
[00:39:49.108 --> 00:39:50.249]  They even tell you they own them.
[00:39:50.249 --> 00:39:53.490]  Dutch Royal Shell.
[00:39:53.490 --> 00:39:55.752]  BP, British Petroleum.
[00:39:55.752 --> 00:40:06.677]  And then you find out, oh, they hired the regulators to go try to shut down all the Koch brother refineries in Louisiana, Mississippi, and Texas that supply the whole Midwest and East Coast.
[00:40:06.677 --> 00:40:08.938]  Oh, and then I just spent hours looking at it.
[00:40:08.938 --> 00:40:10.199]  This economic warfare.
[00:40:10.199 --> 00:40:11.300]  We're trillionaires.
[00:40:12.080 --> 00:40:15.161]  Trillionaires are trying to blow the engine of the U.S.
[00:40:15.161 --> 00:40:20.164]  and the Koch brothers would not shut down their refineries the last 15 years.
[00:40:20.164 --> 00:40:22.425]  But don't worry, they're losing now.
[00:40:22.425 --> 00:40:27.287]  They'll be shut down soon!
[00:40:27.287 --> 00:40:29.368]  And you're like, good, I'll have an electric car.
[00:40:29.368 --> 00:40:34.110]  No, no, no, they're shutting the coal plants down too that create the electricity.
[00:40:34.110 --> 00:40:34.790]  52% of our power.
[00:40:34.790 --> 00:40:36.671]  They're shutting everything down right now.
[00:40:38.208 --> 00:40:45.354]  I mean, you people that support this are self-destructive idiots.
[00:40:45.354 --> 00:40:50.157]  I mean, I am just... See, I said I was going to get into all this other news.
[00:40:50.157 --> 00:41:04.709]  It's just so frustrating to watch us being powered down, and to know how horrible it is, and to know we've gone from 20 million on food stamps to 50 million, and to know that this is all happening, and to just want to stop it.
[00:41:10.691 --> 00:41:13.254]  What's that Three Doors Down song, Dynamite?
[00:41:13.254 --> 00:41:17.280]  We ought to play that coming in the next segment, because that's how I feel.
[00:41:17.280 --> 00:41:18.862]  Kryptonite, yeah, that's it.
[00:41:18.862 --> 00:41:20.444]  I always get the names of things wrong.
[00:41:20.444 --> 00:41:21.646]  Obviously Kryptonite.
[00:41:21.646 --> 00:41:26.913]  See if we can find that, play it coming in, because, you know, I mean, the general public sleepwalking
[00:41:28.687 --> 00:41:44.662]  And I'm sitting here watching them being abused and mega bank trillionaires shutting everything down with mass suicide factories and suicide nets and, you know, five million robots ordered, one million already delivered to replace humans, running around saying how they're going to kill us.
[00:41:44.662 --> 00:41:47.324]  And they're the liberals.
[00:41:47.324 --> 00:41:49.867]  They're the humanitarians because the television said so.
[00:41:52.406 --> 00:42:00.628]  And then there's some private family that had hundreds of patents their father developed, so they independently, kind of in that last window, made their own money.
[00:42:00.628 --> 00:42:07.669]  Steel plants, aluminum plants, fertilizer plants, paper plants, plastic plants, distillates.
[00:42:07.669 --> 00:42:09.969]  Just thousands of factories.
[00:42:09.969 --> 00:42:15.490]  I started realizing just every factory I drive around, half of them are Koch brothers.
[00:42:15.490 --> 00:42:17.571]  Or Koch Carbon, their other brother.
[00:42:17.571 --> 00:42:19.231]  And I just see all this happening.
[00:42:21.707 --> 00:42:22.247]  And you know what?
[00:42:22.247 --> 00:42:22.908]  I agree with you.
[00:42:22.908 --> 00:42:26.249]  I agree with Mother Jones and Media Matters run by the White House and all of them.
[00:42:26.249 --> 00:42:27.390]  Arrest them.
[00:42:27.390 --> 00:42:28.450]  Shut them down.
[00:42:28.450 --> 00:42:30.231]  Shut every coal power plant down.
[00:42:30.231 --> 00:42:31.952]  I'm going to give you what you want here.
[00:42:31.952 --> 00:42:33.633]  Shut every coal plant down.
[00:42:33.633 --> 00:42:35.614]  Shut down all the oil pipelines.
[00:42:35.614 --> 00:42:37.675]  Shut everything down.
[00:42:37.675 --> 00:42:40.516]  Oh, but see, it won't be done quickly where you notice it's ruining you.
[00:42:40.516 --> 00:42:44.158]  It'll be done real slow, creeping financial death.
[00:42:44.158 --> 00:42:48.841]  So you'll be cheering it the whole way while it happens.
[00:42:48.841 --> 00:42:50.902]  There won't be a quick death to the American economy.
[00:42:51.826 --> 00:43:01.748]  While the globalists move everything to China, and it doesn't even empower the Chinese, they're being used to have the race for the bottom, to leverage everything down to absolute zero.
[00:43:01.748 --> 00:43:06.729]  Because when they fall as total slaves, the rest of the world will be sucked down by it.
[00:43:06.729 --> 00:43:08.489]  Sucked down in that competition.
[00:43:08.489 --> 00:43:15.330]  That false fraudulent... It's like a football game where you're playing against the other team on a 90 degree angle.
[00:43:15.330 --> 00:43:19.471]  And they get to kick off from a mountain on top of you, and each time, even if you try to run a touchdown,
[00:43:20.430 --> 00:43:22.671]  You never get to go from the top.
[00:43:22.671 --> 00:43:24.031]  You're always going uphill.
[00:43:24.031 --> 00:43:26.412]  And ignorance absolutely reigns.
[00:43:26.412 --> 00:43:28.993]  What did the Pulitzer Prize winner Chris Hedges say about it?
[00:43:28.993 --> 00:43:41.916]  We now live in a nation where doctors destroy health, lawyers destroy justice, universities destroy knowledge, governments destroy freedom, the press destroys information, religion destroys morals, and our banks destroy the economy.
[00:43:41.916 --> 00:43:42.457]  Chris Hedges.
[00:43:48.379 --> 00:44:00.201]  The United Nations in the New York Times, they admit, in Africa and Latin America and Asia, in Burma, it was the first time I saw a report of this about 15 years ago.
[00:44:00.201 --> 00:44:03.362]  It was even in the National Geographic magazine.
[00:44:03.362 --> 00:44:08.663]  They were saying it was good, so I went and looked it up on kind of the proto-web that it is today.
[00:44:08.663 --> 00:44:11.684]  It was about 99 actually, so 14 years ago.
[00:44:13.726 --> 00:44:22.290]  And it talked about how the UN exterminated thousands of the population to make it a UN biosphere.
[00:44:22.290 --> 00:44:26.132]  They go in and actually shoot the people!
[00:44:26.132 --> 00:44:31.434]  Like you go in and kill a group of invasive elephants that go into farming belts in Africa.
[00:44:31.434 --> 00:44:31.934]  They do that.
[00:44:31.934 --> 00:44:34.956]  And it described the culling of the wild humans.
[00:44:36.560 --> 00:44:39.823]  And then these environmentalists go, well it's got to be done!
[00:44:39.823 --> 00:44:43.145]  I have 15 jets!
[00:44:43.145 --> 00:44:45.347]  You know, I love the Queen of England.
[00:44:45.347 --> 00:44:49.490]  Prince Charles came out and said you shouldn't take a hot shower because of the carbon footprint.
[00:44:49.490 --> 00:44:51.992]  They have over a hundred giant palaces.
[00:44:51.992 --> 00:44:54.153]  Some of them have thousands of rooms.
[00:44:54.153 --> 00:44:57.175]  Some of the palaces are over a hundred square miles.
[00:44:57.175 --> 00:44:59.157]  Not the palace itself, but the grounds of them.
[00:45:01.786 --> 00:45:07.436]  They have, each member has their own private train, private jet copters.
[00:45:07.436 --> 00:45:12.364]  Last time I checked, Prince Charles had more than 20 aircraft and flies them himself.
[00:45:14.540 --> 00:45:21.745]  And they get several billion pounds a year just to pay for their gas allowance to heat the palaces.
[00:45:21.745 --> 00:45:23.025]  I'm gonna say that again.
[00:45:23.025 --> 00:45:26.367]  To heat the... Rothschilds have palaces everywhere.
[00:45:26.367 --> 00:45:27.208]  Same deal.
[00:45:27.208 --> 00:45:30.390]  And they're all saying, you are using too much.
[00:45:30.390 --> 00:45:32.331]  You can't have plastic bags.
[00:45:32.331 --> 00:45:34.272]  Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
[00:45:34.272 --> 00:45:36.154]  While they conspicuously
[00:45:37.062 --> 00:45:38.424]  You want to talk about class envy?
[00:45:38.424 --> 00:45:41.288]  You've got one-tenth of one percent.
[00:45:41.288 --> 00:45:41.909]  We did the math.
[00:45:41.909 --> 00:45:42.429]  What was it?
[00:45:42.429 --> 00:45:44.712]  One out of some impossible number?
[00:45:44.712 --> 00:45:46.034]  What is 600 Top Gophers?
[00:45:46.034 --> 00:45:49.859]  6,000 Minion Gophers?
[00:45:53.464 --> 00:45:56.966]  In the superclass booked by Rothkopf and less than 20 families.
[00:45:56.966 --> 00:46:01.390]  Less than 20 families have more than 80% of the world's wealth.
[00:46:01.390 --> 00:46:02.130]  By the way, when the U.S.
[00:46:02.130 --> 00:46:05.472]  had the biggest middle class in the world, they only had about half of it just a few decades ago.
[00:46:05.472 --> 00:46:10.296]  There, it's the ultra-rich are the ones, man, they're like, I don't own those power plants, shut them down!
[00:46:10.296 --> 00:46:12.397]  I don't own those ships, shut them down!
[00:46:12.397 --> 00:46:14.058]  I don't own those factories, shut them down!
[00:46:14.058 --> 00:46:14.859]  Move them to China!
[00:46:16.596 --> 00:46:26.940]  Well, you gotta go to the Chinese Politburo and the generals, who are all billionaires now, live in literal palaces, and the people are used like slaves while they build the robots to replace us.
[00:46:26.940 --> 00:46:28.501]  Robots that work on robots.
[00:46:28.501 --> 00:46:30.422]  I mean, do you understand how frustrated I am?
[00:46:30.422 --> 00:46:42.567]  And then the boogeyman of the incredible authoritarian, I tell you what, if we're gonna arrest rich people just because they're rich, let's start with the Queen of England, the Rothschilds, the Rockefellers, Ted Turner,
[00:46:44.235 --> 00:46:49.457]  Bill Gates, all of them, and then, after you've arrested all of them, we can arrest the Koch brothers.
[00:46:49.457 --> 00:46:57.260]  If you've got, like, this Soviet dream of, you know, you're in a Che Guevara outfit and storming the Bastille, you know, you're a Jacobin, so you don't know what that is.
[00:46:57.260 --> 00:46:59.180]  You should actually find out before you fantasize.
[00:46:59.180 --> 00:47:00.841]  But a t-shirt's simple for you, isn't it?
[00:47:05.401 --> 00:47:07.262]  They're shutting it all down.
[00:47:07.262 --> 00:47:10.585]  And by the way, they're not shutting it down to bankrupt it and take it over and turn it back on.
[00:47:10.585 --> 00:47:12.487]  They're not going to turn it back on.
[00:47:12.487 --> 00:47:13.627]  Do you understand that?
[00:47:13.627 --> 00:47:16.230]  They're not going to turn any of it back on.
[00:47:16.230 --> 00:47:20.533]  And you're going to laugh now, a lot of you, but you won't be laughing soon.
[00:47:20.533 --> 00:47:21.614]  You won't be laughing soon.
[00:47:22.915 --> 00:47:24.596]  And all the arrogant police.
[00:47:24.596 --> 00:47:29.740]  I can't believe Art Acevedo, our Austin police chief, the only Texas police chief they could get, to go to D.C.
[00:47:29.740 --> 00:47:32.121]  and call for a shutdown of private sales of guns.
[00:47:32.121 --> 00:47:34.363]  That means you can't transfer guns when you die.
[00:47:34.363 --> 00:47:36.204]  You can't give family a gun.
[00:47:36.204 --> 00:47:37.445]  Felonies.
[00:47:37.445 --> 00:47:38.125]  Felonies!
[00:47:38.125 --> 00:47:39.766]  And they will start arresting everybody.
[00:47:39.766 --> 00:47:40.727]  Where'd you get that gun?
[00:47:40.727 --> 00:47:41.628]  Prove your history.
[00:47:41.628 --> 00:47:43.849]  And felonies for over seven round mags.
[00:47:43.849 --> 00:47:45.530]  He wants those banned.
[00:47:45.530 --> 00:47:47.192]  And felonies.
[00:47:47.192 --> 00:47:51.695]  They already ran a fake sting with the ATF trying to shut down Austin gun shows.
[00:47:53.004 --> 00:47:54.605]  And you know, I said he's an authoritarian.
[00:47:54.605 --> 00:47:55.405]  He said, how dare you?
[00:47:55.405 --> 00:48:00.007]  I want to go on your show for saying I'm a commie or an authoritarian because he came from Cuba.
[00:48:00.007 --> 00:48:00.848]  And you know what?
[00:48:00.848 --> 00:48:02.148]  Why don't you go back to Cuba?
[00:48:02.148 --> 00:48:05.790]  In fact, the headline ought to be Arte Cerveda moving back to Cuba.
[00:48:05.790 --> 00:48:07.170]  And he'll probably get real mad about that.
[00:48:07.170 --> 00:48:12.653]  But the point is, is that I guess you're trying to turn America into Cuba so you can go work for the Justice Department.
[00:48:15.489 --> 00:48:20.992]  When Art, you know the crime rates dropped 49% nationwide in violent crime because of armament of the citizens.
[00:48:20.992 --> 00:48:23.773]  The criminals are scared to death since 1991.
[00:48:23.773 --> 00:48:29.136]  The gun ownership graph goes straight up, and the crime rate going down goes straight down.
[00:48:29.136 --> 00:48:30.356]  It's an X on the graph.
[00:48:30.356 --> 00:48:32.057]  Guns go up, crimes go down.
[00:48:32.057 --> 00:48:35.599]  And you know that, but you want to toady up there.
[00:48:35.599 --> 00:48:38.960]  I've got his testimony.
[00:48:38.960 --> 00:48:41.262]  APD chief pushes for tighter gun control.
[00:48:41.262 --> 00:48:41.622]  Here it is.
[00:48:42.916 --> 00:48:44.537]  Unbelievable that this is what our country...
[00:49:00.523 --> 00:49:08.751]  The universal background check is a first and essential step toward comprehensive reform of our firearms and our gun laws.
[00:49:08.751 --> 00:49:09.892]  First step to confiscation!
[00:49:09.892 --> 00:49:15.858]  Without this essential element, there can be no lasting impact on gun violence.
[00:49:15.858 --> 00:49:25.007]  Right now, all licensed dealers have to submit potential buyers to a background check, but that law does not apply to private sellers and person-to-person transactions at gun shows.
[00:49:26.428 --> 00:49:33.374]  Yeah, really what it is is a registration program.
[00:49:33.374 --> 00:49:34.776]  That's what it is.
[00:49:34.776 --> 00:49:42.102]  It is a registration program against the American people.
[00:49:42.102 --> 00:49:42.422]  Period.
[00:49:43.539 --> 00:49:44.200]  And you heard him.
[00:49:44.200 --> 00:49:45.401]  It's an important first step.
[00:49:45.401 --> 00:49:48.083]  He's showing, hey, I know the plan, guys.
[00:49:48.083 --> 00:49:50.025]  Promote me up to federal level.
[00:49:50.025 --> 00:49:51.806]  He's all speaking code.
[00:49:51.806 --> 00:49:53.848]  And Arne Saavedra has put his arm around me.
[00:49:53.848 --> 00:49:55.569]  He's sworn he's a patriot.
[00:49:55.569 --> 00:49:56.270]  He's promised.
[00:49:56.270 --> 00:49:57.931]  There'll never be troops in Austin on the streets.
[00:49:57.931 --> 00:50:02.935]  There's now troops all the time running checkpoints and all sorts of crowd control in Austin.
[00:50:02.935 --> 00:50:06.018]  There's now TSA checkpoints downtown.
[00:50:06.018 --> 00:50:07.079]  And there you go, buddy.
[00:50:07.079 --> 00:50:09.501]  You are un-American.
[00:50:10.936 --> 00:50:13.298]  Just like all the other enemies of this country.
[00:50:13.298 --> 00:50:13.759]  Period.
[00:50:13.759 --> 00:50:17.863]  And the entire Austin police force, you either speak out against this, but you won't.
[00:50:17.863 --> 00:50:20.025]  Because your higher-ups are all politicians, too.
[00:50:20.025 --> 00:50:20.785]  And don't worry!
[00:50:20.785 --> 00:50:28.513]  They're gonna shut your power plants down, shut your future down, and cops hope you look at your kids, because they have no future.
[00:50:28.513 --> 00:50:31.355]  You know, I ran into the cop that was threatening to arrest me at the Austin airport.
[00:50:31.355 --> 00:50:33.197]  I was in an Italian restaurant by the movie theater.
[00:50:34.793 --> 00:50:36.554]  And I see the guy walk in and he sees me.
[00:50:36.554 --> 00:50:40.035]  And he turns and walks over to the bar with his wife where they were going to eat.
[00:50:40.035 --> 00:50:42.597]  And I came over and first he's like, we're fine, we're fine.
[00:50:42.597 --> 00:50:43.237]  Kind of leave me alone.
[00:50:43.237 --> 00:50:45.178]  And then later he looks over and goes, hey, how you doing?
[00:50:45.178 --> 00:50:48.219]  After I think he got the first shock of seeing me.
[00:50:48.219 --> 00:50:56.823]  But the whole point is he was going to see Olympus falling, which again is total fantasy about how terrorists are under every table.
[00:50:56.823 --> 00:50:59.004]  Hey, cops, the real terrorists are the globalists.
[00:50:59.004 --> 00:50:59.905]  They're destroying America.
[00:51:01.280 --> 00:51:05.065]  If you're listening, you know your basic freedoms are being threatened every day.
[00:51:05.065 --> 00:51:08.329]  If you're listening, you know the economy is not getting better.
[00:51:08.329 --> 00:51:11.133]  You know gas and food prices are skyrocketing.
[00:51:11.133 --> 00:51:13.276]  Now is the time to get prepared.

[00:52:00.809 --> 00:52:03.992]  Is this the year you finally get serious about your family's drinking water?
[00:52:03.992 --> 00:52:07.375]  If so, keep listening for a special offer from Big Berkey Water Filters.
[00:52:07.375 --> 00:52:10.357]  Did you know that over 60% of municipal water is fluoridated?
[00:52:10.357 --> 00:52:21.287]  Berkey Water Filters distinguish themselves from many other filtration systems with the capability to significantly reduce dangerous chlorine, fluoride, arsenic, and disinfection byproducts from municipal water via the Black Berkey and PF line of filters.
[00:52:21.287 --> 00:52:22.408]  Then there's affordability.
[00:52:22.408 --> 00:52:27.312]  At only 1.7 cents per gallon, Berkey Water Filters purify treated and untreated water, even
[00:52:27.312 --> 00:52:27.412]  Yeah.
[00:52:27.412 --> 00:52:28.573]  And stagnant pond water.
[00:52:28.573 --> 00:52:34.578]  Stop and think how much money you could save by simply reducing buying bottled water and using water filtered by your Berkey water filter.
[00:52:34.578 --> 00:52:37.480]  No need to be constantly replacing expensive filters with a Berkey.
[00:52:37.480 --> 00:52:39.922]  A single set of filters can last for five to ten years.
[00:52:39.922 --> 00:52:43.465]  Choose the best size Berkey for your needs at Big Berkey Water Filters dot com.
[00:52:43.465 --> 00:52:47.348]  And right now, all GCN listeners get 5% off all ceramic filter systems.

[00:52:48.109 --> 00:52:48.629]  That's 877-99-B-E-R-K-E-Y.
[00:52:55.795 --> 00:53:02.597]  Hey there, my name is Frank Bates.
[00:53:02.597 --> 00:53:05.898]  Do you know the number one most valuable item in a crisis?
[00:53:05.898 --> 00:53:08.079]  Some people think the answer is gold.
[00:53:08.079 --> 00:53:09.659]  Others think it's a gun.
[00:53:09.659 --> 00:53:11.460]  But the correct answer will shock you.
[00:53:12.040 --> 00:53:21.647]  I just created a free video at Crisis123.com that reveals a surprising item that is more valuable than gold in a crisis.
[00:53:21.647 --> 00:53:24.269]  97% of Americans don't have this one critical item.
[00:53:24.269 --> 00:53:26.431]  In fact, they haven't even given it a thought.
[00:53:26.431 --> 00:53:33.916]  And the sad truth is that you may not survive without it when a real crisis hits and a starving mob is right outside your door.
[00:53:33.916 --> 00:53:38.400]  What I have to tell you could literally make the difference between life and death for you and your family.
[00:53:38.900 --> 00:53:45.124]  Watch my video at Crisis123.com to discover the number one most valuable item in a crisis.
[00:53:45.124 --> 00:53:46.465]  You'll be shocked.
[00:53:46.465 --> 00:53:51.688]  See the controversial video that thousands of other smart patrons have already seen in the last three months.
[00:53:51.688 --> 00:53:57.151]  Go watch my video now at Crisis123.com before they force me to shut it down.
[00:53:57.151 --> 00:53:58.512]  Again, that's Crisis123.com.
[00:54:08.462 --> 00:54:17.764]  That's right, our founding fathers battled the tyrants from the grave with the Bill of Rights and Constitution that they enshrined for us.
[00:54:17.764 --> 00:54:35.289]  Here's the deal, real tyrants are taking over and I gotta be honest with you, I've had the Austin Police Chief on four or five times over the years, he's a charming guy, I wanted to believe he wasn't a wicked gun grabber, but they're putting out this hoax that guns are discredited and guns cause crime.
[00:54:36.914 --> 00:54:41.945]  And anybody that tries to disarm the American people is part of the occupying collaborator system.
[00:54:43.154 --> 00:54:51.917]  And so I want everybody to get this video, this live broadcast, but there's video of it that'll be posted at PrisonPlanet.tv and on YouTube and send it to Art Acevedo.
[00:54:51.917 --> 00:55:11.224]  Art, if you think the citizens not having guns, this goes for the rest of the police chiefs that work for the foreign banks one way or another, if you think that guns are so evil in citizens' hands, you should move back to Cuba, you should move to North Korea, you should move to Communist China where they got mobile execution vans.
[00:55:11.744 --> 00:55:17.773]  How dare you come to America and flee tyranny and try to put it on me and my family!
[00:55:17.773 --> 00:55:19.876]  And I take it real personal because I know you!
[00:55:22.301 --> 00:55:24.821]  I take it real personal.
[00:55:24.821 --> 00:55:26.842]  I get sick when I see all these police chiefs up there.
[00:55:26.842 --> 00:55:29.642]  I'm going to roll some video for radio listeners.
[00:55:29.642 --> 00:55:31.483]  We'll post it up at InfoWars.com.
[00:55:31.483 --> 00:55:35.343]  But here's FBI.gov and the crime statistics from 1991 to 2011.
[00:55:35.343 --> 00:55:37.704]  The latest numbers.
[00:55:37.704 --> 00:55:43.785]  A 49% drop in violent crime nationwide on average.
[00:55:43.785 --> 00:55:46.205]  And you can look at the graph of gun ownership.
[00:55:46.205 --> 00:55:47.286]  It goes up.
[00:55:47.286 --> 00:55:48.326]  The crime goes down.
[00:55:48.326 --> 00:55:49.286]  You know that.
[00:55:50.307 --> 00:56:00.435]  You know within one year of Texas having concealed carry, violent home invasions, carjackings, and other aggravated assaults went down by more than 30%.
[00:56:00.435 --> 00:56:06.039]  You know more than 25% in Florida, and you know the same similar number in every stinking state in this country.
[00:56:06.039 --> 00:56:07.981]  And I am sick of you and your hoax.
[00:56:07.981 --> 00:56:17.188]  You want our guns because the globalists are getting ready to implode this country, and you want us to be like people in Mexico who had their guns taken a hundred years ago, and who have been slaves ever since!
[00:56:19.776 --> 00:56:26.656]  Mexico has a total ban on citizen guns and they have the highest gun crime rate in the world.
[00:56:29.724 --> 00:56:31.365]  There's your message, Arte Cerveda.
[00:56:31.365 --> 00:56:33.346]  Go ahead and go get your Justice Department job.
[00:56:33.346 --> 00:56:35.028]  Maybe you'll really show off for them.
[00:56:35.028 --> 00:56:39.611]  Maybe you'll go to the Justice Department and be like Eric Holder, who was involved in Oklahoma City.
[00:56:39.611 --> 00:56:45.675]  Maybe you'll go there and teach us how to ship guns into Mexico to kill thousands of innocent people, so you can blame it.
[00:56:45.675 --> 00:56:49.457]  Maybe you'll show the Justice Department what a good collaborator you are.
[00:56:49.457 --> 00:56:56.282]  Why don't you go back to Cuba and go apologize to Fidel Castro, who's killed hundreds of thousands of his own people after taking their guns.
[00:56:56.282 --> 00:56:59.164]  Why don't you go, Comrade Fidel, I love you!
[00:57:00.165 --> 00:57:01.446]  I love what you do!
[00:57:01.446 --> 00:57:03.608]  I wanna take the guns from America!
[00:57:03.608 --> 00:57:07.793]  Why don't you come to America, Fidel, and help us run everything there?
[00:57:07.793 --> 00:57:09.775]  We will take the guns, Fidel!
[00:57:09.775 --> 00:57:12.919]  I will prove to you, comrade, what we will do to them!
[00:57:12.919 --> 00:57:13.039]  Yeah!
[00:57:15.646 --> 00:57:21.910]  Oh, I'm supposed to just go, oh, my police chief says, put felony if I have over a seven-round mag.
[00:57:21.910 --> 00:57:23.932]  He says shut down the gun show.
[00:57:23.932 --> 00:57:25.833]  Oh, I can't give my dad a gun.
[00:57:25.833 --> 00:57:26.933]  He can't give me a gun.
[00:57:26.933 --> 00:57:30.416]  My dad tried to give me a BB gun last night.
[00:57:30.416 --> 00:57:31.857]  We were over at the house shooting at his house.
[00:57:31.857 --> 00:57:34.258]  Kids were having fun.
[00:57:34.258 --> 00:57:40.983]  One of those Crossman, you know, revolver gas-powered ones, CO2, ooh, evil CO2.
[00:57:40.983 --> 00:57:42.304]  He tried to give it to me and I said no.
[00:57:43.467 --> 00:57:46.068]  Some cities have laws where BB guns are banned.
[00:57:46.068 --> 00:57:47.209]  Felonies for that.
[00:57:47.209 --> 00:57:48.690]  I'm sick of it.
[00:57:48.690 --> 00:57:50.270]  I'm tired of the criminal government.
[00:57:50.270 --> 00:57:52.311]  The government's parasitic, out of control.
[00:57:52.311 --> 00:57:52.972]  I got an idea.
[00:57:52.972 --> 00:57:54.872]  How about the government turns their guns in?
[00:57:54.872 --> 00:57:57.133]  Two billion plus rounds of ammo.
[00:57:57.133 --> 00:57:59.435]  Thousands and thousands of giant armored vehicles.
[00:57:59.435 --> 00:58:00.395]  All the militarization.
[00:58:00.395 --> 00:58:06.338]  And saying now, Homeland Security's for gun owners, returning veterans, libertarians, the rest of us.
[00:58:07.622 --> 00:58:10.124]  Because we stand in the way of the destruction of this country.
[00:58:10.124 --> 00:58:12.325]  And anybody that does is demonized.
[00:58:12.325 --> 00:58:14.466]  You're going to see people join Soron.
[00:58:14.466 --> 00:58:16.708]  You're going to see people join Mordor.
[00:58:16.708 --> 00:58:19.649]  You're going to see people join the New World Order.
[00:58:19.649 --> 00:58:21.651]  I am not one of these people.
[00:58:21.651 --> 00:58:27.134]  And when we come back, Joel Scalz is coming up, but I haven't even gotten into the bombshell news.
[00:58:27.134 --> 00:58:28.815]  40% of the bank accounts to be looted.
[00:58:28.815 --> 00:58:29.015]  40% now.
[00:58:30.696 --> 00:58:42.250]  Oh yeah, and it's gonna spread everywhere, and we've also got hundreds of millions of rounds of more ammo, hollow points for you and your family DHS just bought.
[00:58:42.250 --> 00:58:43.972]  Take the government's guns.
[00:58:43.972 --> 00:58:46.194]  Gun control for the tyrant government.
[00:58:46.194 --> 00:58:47.836]  No standing army in America.
[00:58:47.836 --> 00:58:48.457]  Constitution.
[00:58:50.532 --> 00:58:52.433]  Introducing Pro-1.
[00:58:52.433 --> 00:58:56.076]  All of your filtration in one system, portable, on the go.
[00:58:56.076 --> 00:59:00.599]  No more do you have two or three filters to just reduce sodium fluoride.
[00:59:00.599 --> 00:59:06.743]  You have a system that cuts out the sodium fluoride and up to 95% of hydrofluorosilic acid.
[00:59:06.743 --> 00:59:17.730]  Advanced manufacturing technology combines silver impregnated white ceramic with new Aquamedics advanced media for removal of fluoride and other heavy metals all in one filter element.
[00:59:17.730 --> 00:59:20.352]  It is the only one that does it and out of the gate.

[00:59:24.215 --> 00:59:41.527]  This is the only system that in one unit helps reduce or remove pesticides, herbicides, chloramines, ammonia and chlorine, hydrofluorosilicic acid, the most common form of fluoride not covered by other fluoride filter brands, and sodium hexafluorosilicate.
[00:59:41.527 --> 00:59:46.831]  Get your Pro-Pure with the new Pro-1 filters today at Infowarsstore.com or by calling 888-253-3139.

[00:59:55.938 --> 00:59:58.723]  Alex Jones on the GCM Radio Network.
[01:00:05.322 --> 01:00:10.144]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[01:00:10.144 --> 01:00:11.745]  You want answers?
[01:00:11.745 --> 01:00:13.286]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:13.286 --> 01:00:17.468]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:17.468 --> 01:00:21.550]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:41.024 --> 01:00:50.027]  All right, my friends, coming up for the balance of the hour, Joel Skousen, who's a frequent guest here, an editor of World's Affairs Brief.
[01:00:50.027 --> 01:01:01.832]  A couple of days before he was on with us, a week and a half ago, he survived an incredible plane crash that we have video of for TV viewers watching on PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:01:01.832 --> 01:01:03.212]  So I want to challenge
[01:01:05.149 --> 01:01:18.460]  All of you who are not members of PrisonPlanet.tv to become members of Prison Planet today so you can actually see the video and all the things that we're covering here on the broadcast.
[01:01:20.718 --> 01:01:26.446]  And of course, last hour I didn't plug any sponsors because I get so upset about what's happening here in this country.
[01:01:26.446 --> 01:01:35.298]  But it's also very important to go to infowarestore.com, whether it's pro Second Amendment t-shirts, like the Come and Take It, one that I'm wearing, or whether it's
[01:01:35.638 --> 01:01:42.845]  Camouflage, or Hunter Orange, Infowars.com shirts, whether it's pro-pure water filter, stainless steel, that blow away the competition.
[01:01:42.845 --> 01:01:57.779]  Just go look at the side-by-side comparisons with 10% off with promo code WATER, or whether when you buy films like Strategic Relocation, Escape the Global to Sneak Attack Plan, Region by Region, The Very Best Places to Live, Invaluable Book and Film,
[01:01:58.863 --> 01:02:02.025]  Available at InfoWarsStore.com.

[01:02:31.247 --> 01:02:34.449]  We are on the offense because the best defense is a...
[01:02:35.674 --> 01:02:36.555]  We're good to go.
[01:02:56.263 --> 01:03:02.167]  The shipping is very cost prohibitive normally because it's such a large part of the price because it weighs so much.
[01:03:02.167 --> 01:03:04.168]  So this is a special they do every March.
[01:03:04.168 --> 01:03:06.229]  It ends here in just four or five days.

[01:05:41.460 --> 01:05:43.441]  This is an amazing deal.
[01:05:43.441 --> 01:05:48.662]  You can save thousands of dollars and you will love the way Real Soap makes you feel.
[01:05:48.662 --> 01:05:50.843]  See them on the web at 5starsoap.com.
[01:05:51.403 --> 01:05:52.284]  Or call 800-340-7091 for a free catalog.
[01:06:00.396 --> 01:06:07.620]  A little over a year ago, I began to do a lot of research into why, even though I had a pretty good-sized meal, I was still starving.
[01:06:07.620 --> 01:06:25.511]  And my research led me to a well-known fact that most of the soils that we grow our crops on here in the United States and across the industrialized world are almost completely depleted of almost all of the key minerals and trace elements that our bodies need to rebuild themselves, fight off cancer, and be healthy.
[01:06:25.511 --> 01:06:29.613]  I then searched out the best vitamin and mineral company out there.
[01:06:29.893 --> 01:06:31.654]  And discovered Young-Jevity.
[01:06:31.654 --> 01:06:39.840]  The Young-Jevity products are designed to give you the real nutrition you need, and once you've got that, you don't have to eat as much to be satisfied.
[01:06:39.840 --> 01:06:46.144]  I've lost 37 pounds in two months, simply getting the vitamins and minerals I need.
[01:06:46.144 --> 01:06:47.425]  Check it out for yourself.
[01:06:47.425 --> 01:06:48.305]  It's incredible.
[01:06:48.305 --> 01:06:57.512]  Go to Infowarsteam.com today and order your first canister of Beyond Tangy Tangerine Complete Multivitamin Mineral Complex Dietary Supplement.
[01:06:57.512 --> 01:06:59.393]  That's Infowarsteam.com.
[01:06:59.753 --> 01:07:00.111]  Yeah.
[01:07:00.603 --> 01:07:09.145]  Devastating events like earthquakes, tornadoes, floods, hurricanes, or the threat of martial law have highlighted the need for Americans to prepare for emergencies.
[01:07:09.145 --> 01:07:12.826]  As a result, millions are stockpiling food, gold, and weapons.
[01:07:12.826 --> 01:07:17.286]  But how will these items help if you or one of your loved ones becomes ill?
[01:07:17.286 --> 01:07:22.327]  Supernatural silver is the ultimate tool to prepare you for a medical emergency.
[01:07:22.327 --> 01:07:29.829]  Supernatural silver is a natural antibiotic that is uniquely effective against bacteria, viruses, molds, and fungus.
[01:07:30.049 --> 01:07:30.409]  We're good to go.
[01:08:05.492 --> 01:08:10.317]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[01:08:10.317 --> 01:08:11.919]  You want answers?
[01:08:11.919 --> 01:08:13.461]  Well, so does he.
[01:08:13.461 --> 01:08:17.665]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:08:17.665 --> 01:08:21.710]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:08:23.308 --> 01:08:26.629]  Welcome, my friends, to the second hour of the WorldWide Broadcast.
[01:08:26.629 --> 01:08:31.631]  It is Monday, the 25th day of March 2013.
[01:08:31.631 --> 01:08:38.514]  He was on with us about a week and a half ago, Joel Skousen of World Affairs Brief.
[01:08:38.514 --> 01:08:39.835]  He's going to be joining us.
[01:08:39.835 --> 01:08:42.436]  He didn't tell me a day and a half before he was on.
[01:08:42.436 --> 01:08:51.139]  He survived an incredible plane crash that was actually local and ended up being covered by some national news as a miraculous survival.
[01:08:51.139 --> 01:08:51.840]  Same thing with the
[01:08:53.775 --> 01:08:56.657]  Head of the UK Independence Party, Nigel Farage.
[01:08:56.657 --> 01:09:00.199]  He barely survived an incredible crash, by the grace of God.
[01:09:00.199 --> 01:09:07.103]  We're going to be briefly talking about that, and just the perspective on life, and then shifting gears into other geopolitical issues.
[01:09:07.103 --> 01:09:11.746]  But first off, if you just joined us, there's an article by Adon Salazar.
[01:09:12.546 --> 01:09:26.559]  That was posted yesterday up at Infowars.com and PrisonPlanet.com, where a retired Army Captain warns DHS acquisitions are bold threat of war against the American people.
[01:09:26.559 --> 01:09:29.562]  Says Americans may have to prepare to defend themselves in the U.S.
[01:09:29.562 --> 01:09:34.026]  Constitution against the Obama administration's coup against the American people.
[01:09:34.026 --> 01:09:34.927]  And then he breaks down
[01:09:35.828 --> 01:09:41.070]  The armored vehicles, the Indo-Paci Commentatus, and he really crystallizes it for me.
[01:09:41.070 --> 01:09:47.712]  Because it's what the Rand Corporation admits they would do back in 1998 in a report that I covered on air at the time.
[01:09:47.712 --> 01:09:54.814]  Federalized, but that itself is UN or globalized via the global corporate government.
[01:09:54.814 --> 01:10:01.436]  That's three different groups battling for control of it, but they all support the global government because they all think they're going to get control of it.
[01:10:02.759 --> 01:10:05.381]  And he explains in his letter to the U.S.
[01:10:05.381 --> 01:10:17.451]  Senator, and it's published up at InfoWars.com with a video report I did yesterday, he goes on to explain this is a fifth branch of the military.
[01:10:17.451 --> 01:10:22.935]  It's really even outside of NORTHCOM that it ties into there in Colorado Springs and Denver.
[01:10:22.935 --> 01:10:25.157]  It's the shadow government absorbing America.
[01:10:26.038 --> 01:10:31.800]  Thousands of armored vehicles, not just the 2,700 going to different agencies.
[01:10:31.800 --> 01:10:33.881]  Every police department I know has armored vehicles.
[01:10:33.881 --> 01:10:35.442]  Helicopters.
[01:10:35.442 --> 01:10:36.402]  They're getting new ones.
[01:10:36.402 --> 01:10:40.483]  I see the big black armored ones here in Austin that say DHS Federal Police.
[01:10:40.483 --> 01:10:43.605]  We've done video reports on it.
[01:10:43.605 --> 01:10:47.006]  So we've got all of this happening, all of that unfolding.
[01:10:48.513 --> 01:10:54.815]  And you've got state and federal agencies, you can't swing a dead cat anywhere in the U.S.
[01:10:54.815 --> 01:11:09.420]  now without federal task forces, state task forces, international task forces, zoning cops wearing uniforms, and there are even arming zoning cops in many cities.
[01:11:09.420 --> 01:11:11.661]  Just real hardcore tyranny.
[01:11:12.526 --> 01:11:21.673]  That is all covered in the United Nations Industrial Development Organization Plan from the 50s, 60s, and 70s that is the forerunner of Agenda 21.
[01:11:21.673 --> 01:11:29.218]  Of real control is about controlling industry and shutting it down so only select groups at the top of the combine can operate.
[01:11:29.218 --> 01:11:39.566]  And they've made deals to transfer everything to China as a way to leverage and get full political control of us here domestically.
[01:11:39.566 --> 01:11:41.648]  And the good news is this debate
[01:11:43.527 --> 01:11:56.554]  Is now beginning to really take hold out there about why is government arming to the teeth domestically and saying gun owners, conservatives, libertarians are the new number one terror threat as we warned you they would go public with because that was internal a decade ago.
[01:11:57.571 --> 01:12:00.855]  The fact that they're going public means they're getting ready to go more and more operational.
[01:12:00.855 --> 01:12:09.527]  They've got all the movies, the TV shows where the new bad guys are mainly white gun owners, conservatives, libertarians, who are secretly Taliban.
[01:12:09.527 --> 01:12:11.169]  And they've got new movies out.
[01:12:11.169 --> 01:12:14.593]  So they wouldn't be bringing all this out unless they were moving into a hotter phase
[01:12:16.021 --> 01:12:20.786]  With a false flag or something along those lines to politically demonize us.
[01:12:20.786 --> 01:12:30.235]  Because anytime the globalists can't win, they will stage events to blame it on you as a form of political judo in a self-inflicted inside job operation.
[01:12:31.397 --> 01:12:35.878]  And I see all the stars aligning for that to be done.
[01:12:35.878 --> 01:12:41.260]  But if we have a maximum effort right now to expose this, it may push their timetable back.
[01:12:41.260 --> 01:12:45.721]  Their timetable, Brzezinski says, is a decade behind.
[01:12:45.721 --> 01:12:50.422]  Joel Skousen, who's a smart guy in my summation, says they're about a decade behind.
[01:12:50.422 --> 01:12:52.283]  I believe they're about a decade behind.
[01:12:52.283 --> 01:12:55.824]  Don't have the defeatist attitude that we couldn't take America back.
[01:12:55.824 --> 01:12:58.885]  It's that foregone conclusion, that self-fulfilling prophecy,
[01:12:59.525 --> 01:13:08.573]  We should be offensively trying to take America back, but we are up against a powerful array of forces, as Joel says, while building a defense fallback position.
[01:13:08.573 --> 01:13:10.795]  So you've got to be on offense and defense.
[01:13:10.795 --> 01:13:23.007]  But right now, I am myself on full tilt offense, because I've already set up my defense, moving out to a country zone that's a little safer, food, firearms, friends, family, educated.
[01:13:24.161 --> 01:13:26.906]  But before we go to Joel, here's just a few of these articles today.
[01:13:26.906 --> 01:13:27.708]  This is a U.S.
[01:13:27.708 --> 01:13:28.510]  News & World Report.
[01:13:28.510 --> 01:13:30.614]  It cites Infowars.com.
[01:13:30.614 --> 01:13:32.998]  DHS denies massive ammunition purchases.
[01:13:34.207 --> 01:13:38.871]  And when you go and look at what Media Matters and other White House groups, they just say there are no bullets, period.
[01:13:38.871 --> 01:13:40.213]  There are no armored vehicles.
[01:13:40.213 --> 01:13:46.779]  They actually lie and say, not that we bought $500 million this year and are going to get a couple billion over the next few years.
[01:13:46.779 --> 01:13:48.941]  They're just denying it and saying it doesn't exist.
[01:13:48.941 --> 01:13:49.821]  Here's the Drudge Report.
[01:13:49.821 --> 01:13:52.864]  360,000 more rounds, another purchase, and that's at InfoWars.com.
[01:13:58.329 --> 01:13:59.589]  I don't know.
[01:14:16.283 --> 01:14:24.530]  He says he's going to hit the road with a political campaign against guns, which he promised to not go after four years ago.
[01:14:24.530 --> 01:14:27.833]  Bloomberg has a $14 million ad blitz.
[01:14:27.833 --> 01:14:28.774]  It was $12 million.
[01:14:28.774 --> 01:14:32.997]  Now they've announced it's $14 million last night against the Second Amendment.
[01:14:32.997 --> 01:14:38.522]  They're on the offense, folks, because they're going to stage something or provocateur something to blame the Second Amendment.
[01:14:38.522 --> 01:14:39.963]  I could see all the signs.
[01:14:39.963 --> 01:14:42.486]  I told you that back in November before Sandy Hook.
[01:14:43.254 --> 01:14:45.435]  Okay, I mean, it's all lined up right now.
[01:14:45.435 --> 01:14:51.419]  DHS, again, ladies and gentlemen, is moving on all fronts right now.
[01:14:51.419 --> 01:14:53.120]  And I understand what Joel says.
[01:14:53.120 --> 01:15:01.405]  If we run around like total chickens with our heads cut off, let's just cover this first, then we'll get into your plane crash, which is just miraculous.
[01:15:01.405 --> 01:15:05.607]  We have video of it and more for the TV viewers watching on PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:15:05.607 --> 01:15:06.488]  But Joel Skousen,
[01:15:07.208 --> 01:15:13.415]  Of course, he's better known as the best-selling author of The Secure Home, Strategic Relocation, now in its third edition.
[01:15:13.415 --> 01:15:17.600]  Both books and the video are available at Infowarshop.com.
[01:15:17.600 --> 01:15:20.383]  And I produced a film with him, breaking it down.
[01:15:20.383 --> 01:15:25.749]  Strategic Relocation, the film, all available at Infowarshop.com if you want to support all of our work.
[01:15:26.890 --> 01:15:33.574]  What I'm saying is, people are finally waking up that there's an arms buildup, a domestic buildup against us.
[01:15:33.574 --> 01:15:38.497]  They're finally getting the common sense that, hey, a standing army's dangerous.
[01:15:38.497 --> 01:15:49.925]  I know, politically, that if we keep pushing this, it will discredit their gun grab, because why should we turn our guns in when they're arming to the teeth against us?
[01:15:49.925 --> 01:15:50.505]  Joel Skousen.
[01:15:52.269 --> 01:15:58.375]  It's a really interesting conundrum, Alex, because there are two forces at work here.
[01:15:58.375 --> 01:16:12.329]  One, the government trying to provoke the right into displaying something radical enough to justify all of their warnings about the domestic terrorists on the right that the Southern Poverty Law Conference has been putting out.
[01:16:12.329 --> 01:16:14.991]  And at the same time, they're trying to push this gun control
[01:16:15.959 --> 01:16:17.539]  And it's backfiring on him there.
[01:16:17.539 --> 01:16:26.282]  I mean, even the governor of New York is backtracking on the seven round clips because there's such a wall of resistance.
[01:16:26.282 --> 01:16:28.202]  He's trying to placate that resistance.
[01:16:28.202 --> 01:16:34.764]  So they're overplaying their hand at the same time they're trying to get us to overplay our hand.
[01:16:34.764 --> 01:16:37.325]  And so we have to be very careful to walk this line.
[01:16:37.325 --> 01:16:40.985]  But I think you've got the exact appropriate right approach.
[01:16:40.985 --> 01:16:42.466]  We've got to go on the offensive.
[01:16:43.166 --> 01:16:50.853]  Without engendering anybody claiming, like, let's arm, let's go attack now, that would undermine our cause.
[01:16:50.853 --> 01:16:53.256]  But one thing is very clear, Alex.
[01:16:53.256 --> 01:17:02.264]  The government cannot use 3 billion rounds, the Department of Homeland Security cannot use 3 billion rounds of ammunition.
[01:17:02.264 --> 01:17:02.765]  It's 24 wars worth.
[01:17:05.524 --> 01:17:32.151]  of him handgun ammunition of the type of uh... that was in world war two and so obviously they're either trying to corner the market or simply uh... enraged that uh... the people about this and it could backfire on them but i can tell you that congress is getting extremely upset about this i think that number fifteen congressman is going to grow uh... if they don't get some answers they are refusing to answer anybody in congress people are getting upset
[01:17:32.731 --> 01:17:41.681]  With the Department of Homeland Security, especially in this sequester environment when they don't have any money to operate and they're buying three billion rounds of ammunition.
[01:17:41.681 --> 01:17:44.744]  Now, remember that these are requisitions.
[01:17:44.744 --> 01:17:46.265]  These have not been delivered yet.
[01:17:47.287 --> 01:17:52.029]  There are steady streams of ammunition being delivered to DHS, but nothing of this quantity.
[01:17:52.029 --> 01:17:52.729]  No, exactly.
[01:17:52.729 --> 01:17:58.292]  I mean, what it's done is they're buying whatever the companies say they can manufacture.
[01:17:58.292 --> 01:17:59.532]  I mean, I've dug into it.
[01:17:59.532 --> 01:18:02.394]  As much as they can make, they're cornering the market.
[01:18:02.394 --> 01:18:05.195]  Clearly, that is one level of what they're doing.
[01:18:05.195 --> 01:18:07.256]  That is the main cause of the shortages.
[01:18:07.256 --> 01:18:12.698]  What you can't get is the .308, the .223, the .40 hollow point.
[01:18:12.698 --> 01:18:16.000]  What you can't get is what they're purchasing.
[01:18:16.940 --> 01:18:28.324]  Now, I also have contacts in Canada with the gun manufacturers in Canada who have said they've received phone calls from government pressuring them not to import any more weapons into the United States.
[01:18:28.324 --> 01:18:31.865]  They can't legally require them not to, but they're warning them.
[01:18:32.245 --> 01:18:33.646]  We don't want any more inputs.
[01:18:33.646 --> 01:18:36.028]  They're trying to dry up the supply.
[01:18:36.028 --> 01:18:36.569]  Very, very clear.
[01:18:36.569 --> 01:18:40.632]  Oh yeah, that's what Bloomberg and Obama and all of them have said in their task force.
[01:18:40.632 --> 01:18:48.079]  They said, we're calling manufacturers, we're calling government leaders, and we're seeing what we can do outside of law.
[01:18:48.079 --> 01:18:50.180]  Is that not really racketeering?
[01:18:50.180 --> 01:18:51.842]  To have them just leaning on people?
[01:18:52.739 --> 01:18:53.119]  It is.
[01:18:53.119 --> 01:18:59.421]  This is a conspiracy and it's proof that they're in collusion to try to stop Americans from having weapons.
[01:18:59.421 --> 01:19:08.224]  But it's only exacerbating, in their minds, the weapons because... That was my next point.
[01:19:08.224 --> 01:19:13.566]  Don't tyrants get that their open attack is what always backfires?
[01:19:13.566 --> 01:19:17.567]  The fact that they've done this has absolutely begun to mobilize people.
[01:19:19.249 --> 01:19:20.530]  And I don't think it's going to stop.
[01:19:20.530 --> 01:19:22.251]  It's just like the Cypriot situation.
[01:19:22.251 --> 01:19:28.854]  They put on controls on everything.
[01:19:28.854 --> 01:19:30.215]  We lost his Skype for a moment.
[01:19:30.215 --> 01:19:32.076]  The wonders of Skype.
[01:19:32.076 --> 01:19:33.536]  But still it occasionally cuts out.
[01:19:33.536 --> 01:19:36.178]  We're going to try to reconnect with Joel Skousen.
[01:19:36.178 --> 01:19:37.599]  And we'll look at what's happening in Cyprus.
[01:19:37.599 --> 01:19:39.500]  I haven't gotten to that yet.
[01:19:39.500 --> 01:19:41.280]  I've covered one stack of news.
[01:19:41.280 --> 01:19:41.861]  There are
[01:19:43.649 --> 01:19:45.030]  Twelve others.
[01:19:45.030 --> 01:19:49.235]  Twelve other stacks that we're going to be covering at Open Phones in the third hour.
[01:19:49.235 --> 01:19:55.041]  We're going to look at what's happening in Cyprus with Joel Skousen, straight ahead of World Affairs Brief.
[01:19:55.041 --> 01:19:57.123]  And we'll give you that URL on the other side.
[01:19:57.123 --> 01:19:59.065]  JoelSkousen.com will also get you there.
[01:20:00.916 --> 01:20:02.357]  Hello, I'm Alex Jones.
[01:20:02.357 --> 01:20:13.008]  Myself, my family, the InfoWars.com team want to relay to you and your families that we are intensifying our efforts against the globalists on every front.
[01:20:13.008 --> 01:20:17.112]  InfoWars.com is leading the fight against the technocrats.
[01:20:17.472 --> 01:20:20.214]  But we can't do that without your help.
[01:20:20.214 --> 01:20:31.483]  By getting the films, bumper stickers, and t-shirts at InfoWars.com, you will wake up people in your area and support our operation as we move to the next level.
[01:20:31.483 --> 01:20:34.646]  We need your help to spread the word like never before.
[01:20:34.966 --> 01:20:41.109]  They wish to hide themselves during this tectonic battle between the forces of freedom and darkness.
[01:20:41.109 --> 01:20:51.015]  You are the response to the globalist technocrats and their program of global eugenics dehumanization and ultimate extermination.
[01:20:51.015 --> 01:20:52.516]  The war is here.
[01:20:52.516 --> 01:20:54.417]  It's an info war.
[01:20:54.417 --> 01:20:56.478]  The spirit of 1776 versus the mindset of 1984.
[01:21:01.209 --> 01:21:03.590]  You've heard about our MRE Smorgasbord.
[01:21:03.590 --> 01:21:11.813]  Now, Long Life Food Depot introduces the most unique, safe, and longest-lasting way to stash emergency food, the EatPod.
[01:21:11.813 --> 01:21:18.315]  Most survival food products recommend an ideal storage environment, including low temps, low moisture, and low oxygen.
[01:21:18.315 --> 01:21:20.716]  If you're storing in a basement, too humid.
[01:21:20.716 --> 01:21:22.756]  Garage as an attic, too hot.
[01:21:22.756 --> 01:21:27.298]  But the waterproof, double-walled, high-density polyethylene patent-pending EatPod
[01:21:27.458 --> 01:21:40.968]  is a unique rollaway food bunker that creates the perfect conditions, can be buried up to 30 feet, and can keep your survival food supply safe, secure, dry, and virtually undetectable for 25 years or more.
[01:21:40.968 --> 01:21:47.573]  Get full details on the Eatpod at eatpod.com spelled E-A-T-P-O-D dot com or call 800-601-2833.
[01:21:47.573 --> 01:21:47.793]  That's 800-601-2833.
[01:21:47.793 --> 01:21:49.554]  The Eatpod from Long Life Food Depot.
[01:21:56.519 --> 01:21:59.943]  Since 1983, sending real food to your real future.
[01:22:00.666 --> 01:22:05.027]  Now there's an amazing new natural antibiotic every person must have!
[01:22:05.027 --> 01:22:11.828]  It's Cells Alive Silver Solution and it destroys over 650 hard to kill viruses, fungus, bacteria, and much more.
[01:22:11.828 --> 01:22:19.509]  Cells Alive Silver Solution has no expiration date, is great for emergency kits and storage shelters, and comes in 8 or 16 ounce bottles.
[01:22:19.509 --> 01:22:21.590]  Order today at 888-910-4367 or visit hempusa.org.
[01:22:21.590 --> 01:22:22.130]  Hempusa.org.
[01:22:22.130 --> 01:22:24.570]  100% chemical-free superfoods and unique health products.
[01:22:30.171 --> 01:22:39.497]  We the people grow cotton, weave fabric, engrave ink, embed strips and fibers to protect from counterfeit, then carting to a private bank, having it led back at interest, forcing taxes to service debt.
[01:22:39.497 --> 01:22:40.278]  This capitalism?
[01:22:40.278 --> 01:22:46.562]  Or was Jefferson correct when stating a central bank issuing the public currency is a greater menace to the liberties of the people than a standing army?
[01:22:46.562 --> 01:22:47.363]  Hi, Ted Anderson.
[01:22:47.363 --> 01:22:50.525]  I'm placing a free silver dollar in a book that explains our monetary system.
[01:22:50.525 --> 01:22:51.465]  Call for your copy 800-686-2237.
[01:22:51.465 --> 01:22:52.846]  It's time to understand the system.
[01:22:52.846 --> 01:22:53.166]  Call 800-686-2237.
[01:22:53.166 --> 01:22:53.447]  That's 800-686-2237.
[01:23:00.511 --> 01:23:01.172]  We're good to go.
[01:23:17.941 --> 01:23:22.723]  Giving your body an undamaged amino acid food can make a huge difference in your health.
[01:23:22.723 --> 01:23:26.864]  One World Way is an undamaged amino acid food unlike any other.
[01:23:26.864 --> 01:23:34.988]  You see, heating bends and twists amino acids, and all whey protein powders we've investigated, and most proteins you consume, are heated.
[01:23:34.988 --> 01:23:38.469]  With our TrueCool process, you now have a choice with One World Way.
[01:23:38.889 --> 01:23:39.930]  My name is Daniel.
[01:23:39.930 --> 01:23:41.131]  I'm 34 years old.
[01:23:41.131 --> 01:23:45.074]  When I started using One World Way, I weighed 228 pounds.
[01:23:45.074 --> 01:23:48.797]  Now, after two and a half months, I weigh 182 pounds.
[01:23:48.797 --> 01:23:50.098]  This is my ideal weight.
[01:23:50.098 --> 01:23:55.082]  I've noticed an increase in stamina, rate of recovery from workouts, and an increase in my potency.
[01:23:55.082 --> 01:23:56.623]  Call 888-988-3325 or visit oneworldway.com.
[01:24:11.181 --> 01:24:14.622]  Alright, my friends, Alex Jones here, back live.
[01:24:14.622 --> 01:24:21.084]  You know, I told you more than a decade ago, because it was in IMF and World Bank plans, I wrote about it in my book, Descent into Tyranny 2002.
[01:24:21.084 --> 01:24:28.726]  It's on record, e-books, posted right now at Infowarsnews.com for all subscribers.
[01:24:28.726 --> 01:24:30.227]  The book's out of print.
[01:24:30.227 --> 01:24:33.048]  Their own documents, they plan to bankrupt Europe and the US.
[01:24:34.008 --> 01:24:40.190]  And transfer the jobs to China, but they don't completely trust China, so they'll keep our military just to menace them.
[01:24:40.190 --> 01:24:44.412]  It's all about not having any one group that can stand up for itself.
[01:24:44.412 --> 01:24:49.934]  And now, even mainstream news admits most of the debt is not that of the people in Cyprus.
[01:24:49.934 --> 01:24:53.235]  It's gone to back up private central banks' debt.
[01:24:53.235 --> 01:24:55.396]  And first they were going to take 10% out of everybody's account.
[01:24:56.320 --> 01:25:07.943]  Now the deal, we have the official EU video coming up, is 40%, the top 40% of bank accounts, that's a lot of people, will have 7-15% taken out.
[01:25:07.943 --> 01:25:09.344]  Now they're talking about it in other countries.
[01:25:09.344 --> 01:25:13.985]  So, foreign banks taking money directly out of your bank account to pay them
[01:25:15.225 --> 01:25:17.448]  That is the essence of the New World Order.
[01:25:17.448 --> 01:25:22.715]  Joel Skousen of World Affairs Brief joins us to break that down.
[01:25:22.715 --> 01:25:27.741]  Joel, you started getting into Cyprus before your Skype had an interruption.
[01:25:27.741 --> 01:25:30.024]  Yes, well, the Cyprus has taken a turn.
[01:25:31.627 --> 01:25:47.101]  For the better for the EU, I keep saying time and again they will do anything it takes to keep the EU alive and not let these countries leave, and that has proven out correctly, even though they have really had to pull all the stops out against bank accounts in order to do so.
[01:25:47.101 --> 01:25:56.830]  They did the populist thing by saving those with less than $100,000 accounts, but what they did basically is eliminate the second largest bank, the Lycos Bank,
[01:25:57.651 --> 01:25:58.031]  Thank you.
[01:26:16.730 --> 01:26:23.455]  And taken 40% of those accounts and now that's a major, major haircut.
[01:26:23.455 --> 01:26:32.943]  But remember, they made investors in the Greek banks take a 50% haircut during that bailout.
[01:26:32.943 --> 01:26:40.769]  What's interesting though is that I found out that the majority of the Russian deposits had already left that bank.
[01:26:42.085 --> 01:26:54.389]  And it transferred their money over to the Bank of Cyprus and so essentially they let the non-Russian large investors take that haircut in preserving the Bank of Cyprus.
[01:26:54.389 --> 01:26:59.371]  But at the same time, because they have completely destroyed the trust in the banks,
[01:27:00.771 --> 01:27:04.273]  They have no definite opening date for the Bank of Cyprus.
[01:27:04.273 --> 01:27:09.697]  They still have a limit of 120 euros a day for people to take out of their ATMs.
[01:27:09.697 --> 01:27:18.462]  And they're going to have limits, indefinite limits, on further withdrawals from the Bank of Cyprus after this so-called thing is resolved.
[01:27:19.503 --> 01:27:24.708]  So what it means is Cyprus is done as an economy.
[01:27:24.708 --> 01:27:27.771]  They're just simply, I don't know how they're going to survive.
[01:27:27.771 --> 01:27:33.417]  The banking economy was about eight times larger than the real tourist economy.
[01:27:35.038 --> 01:27:47.650]  What they're going to have to do is prolong this until they can get the major gas fields online in Cyprus, which have the potential of replacing about 40% of Europe's gas needs.
[01:27:47.650 --> 01:27:52.695]  That's a cash cow I think they're holding on to for future use in Cyprus.
[01:27:55.814 --> 01:27:57.955]  Joel Skousen is our guest.
[01:27:57.955 --> 01:28:01.097]  What does this do to people all over the world, their confidence in banks?
[01:28:01.097 --> 01:28:07.780]  Not only do you not get interest now, but now it's your money and they just come and steal it to give it to private interest.
[01:28:07.780 --> 01:28:10.261]  I mean, this is unprecedented.
[01:28:10.261 --> 01:28:11.521]  Well, they have done it.
[01:28:13.581 --> 01:28:13.821]  I think?
[01:28:30.879 --> 01:28:38.003]  And that means that even for the first time, senior bondholders, the first in line, are having to take a haircut.
[01:28:38.003 --> 01:28:43.226]  Though, from what I hear from my European sources, it's not very much of a haircut.
[01:28:43.226 --> 01:28:47.989]  They are taking the unsecured creditors over $100,000 and making them lose everything.
[01:28:49.810 --> 01:28:53.172]  Sure, sure, and let me be specific here.
[01:28:53.172 --> 01:28:55.394]  I had read the articles out this morning.
[01:28:55.394 --> 01:28:58.816]  They're up on Infowars.com, Paul Joseph Watson's article.
[01:28:58.816 --> 01:29:06.140]  Europe, anyone with over 100,000 euro savings now has to have 40% taken out of their account.
[01:29:06.140 --> 01:29:08.462]  And I had what I'd call a Freudian mistake.
[01:29:09.122 --> 01:29:11.904]  Because before it was just going to be 10 to 15 percent they took out.
[01:29:11.904 --> 01:29:13.985]  Some estimates were 7.7 or even 6.9.
[01:29:13.985 --> 01:29:21.050]  And I mentally cannot believe they're going to take 40 percent out of anybody with over 100,000 euros.
[01:29:21.050 --> 01:29:23.011]  So my mind twisted that.
[01:29:23.011 --> 01:29:25.493]  I mean, that is that is so huge.
[01:29:26.013 --> 01:29:27.153]  We're on the march.
[01:29:27.153 --> 01:29:28.134]  The empire's on the run.
[01:29:54.009 --> 01:29:56.661]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:30:02.398 --> 01:30:04.939]  And you're subject to other police action.
[01:30:04.939 --> 01:30:06.200]  Tyranny is here.
[01:30:06.200 --> 01:30:09.841]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[01:30:09.841 --> 01:30:12.382]  It really says that the state is God.
[01:30:12.382 --> 01:30:18.244]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on Earth.
[01:30:18.244 --> 01:30:24.467]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps, now being expanded nationwide.
[01:30:24.907 --> 01:30:30.848]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful shadow state.
[01:30:30.848 --> 01:30:35.049]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depth to which our republic has fallen.
[01:30:35.049 --> 01:30:39.350]  Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship.
[01:30:39.350 --> 01:30:45.291]  Body scanners, sound cameras, citizen spies, stage terror, and cameras on every street corner.
[01:30:45.291 --> 01:30:48.851]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[01:30:48.851 --> 01:30:50.812]  The police state isn't coming.
[01:30:50.812 --> 01:30:51.252]  It's here.

[01:33:01.525 --> 01:33:11.987]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:33:11.987 --> 01:33:21.389]  Ladies and gentlemen, I spend, let's not exaggerate, six, seven hours a day trying to research news and information on top of being on the air.
[01:33:23.433 --> 01:33:26.576]  And I can't keep track of but a fraction of what's happening.
[01:33:26.576 --> 01:33:30.701]  But everywhere we look, corruption is moving at light speed.
[01:33:30.701 --> 01:33:38.349]  And the more the corrupt raid pension funds, engage in new taxes, regulations, a new insider cronyism.
[01:33:39.980 --> 01:33:59.653]  The more that accelerates, the more other criminals are able to move in government and corporations, and it creates kind of a swarm effect against which there aren't a lot of defenses other than having good people swarm back at them and get in their face and sue them and criticize them and resist them.
[01:33:59.653 --> 01:34:05.157]  And that's why we've got to get you active, because when you just go to a city council meeting, that freaks them out.
[01:34:05.937 --> 01:34:14.764]  When you go to one of their Agenda 21 meetings and expose the fact you know it's a global financial espionage takeover, it freaks them out.
[01:34:14.764 --> 01:34:21.510]  When you run for office and for city or county or state and go to these debates, it freaks them out.
[01:34:21.510 --> 01:34:28.996]  And it educates others and then you'll meet like-minded people and you can start creating your own centers of resistance.
[01:34:28.996 --> 01:34:31.278]  Now, we're going to go back to our guest and cover the waterfront.
[01:34:31.978 --> 01:34:42.702]  Here, finish up with the financials, get into some of the geopoliticals, and then also talk about what's happening in the aftermath of his plane crash, and we're certainly glad he survived that.
[01:34:42.702 --> 01:34:51.425]  But briefly, if you want to wake people up, it is not just about what regions are the safest area, and of course that's in sub-regions right around where you live.
[01:34:51.425 --> 01:34:53.786]  If you can't go to these safest places in America,
[01:34:54.626 --> 01:34:58.907]  There are also places that you can go to in your region.
[01:34:58.907 --> 01:35:05.268]  It's in the book, Strategic Relocation, third edition, available at infowarestore.com.
[01:35:05.268 --> 01:35:09.109]  And you can also get the film I produced with Joel, Strategic Relocation.
[01:35:09.109 --> 01:35:20.551]  The film that gets into the geopolitical, the world regions, the ethnic Balkanization they use, all of it is in this two and a half hour presentation.
[01:35:21.351 --> 01:35:31.856]  There's also his book as well, The Secure Home, that is the Bible of securing homes on a small budget or a medium budget or a large budget.

[01:35:55.067 --> 01:35:56.948]  And again, Joel Skousen is our guest.
[01:35:56.948 --> 01:36:04.392]  He is the editor and publisher of World Affairs Brief, and we'll put that website up on screen for viewers here in just a moment.
[01:36:04.392 --> 01:36:10.615]  Joel, I want to move quick now, because I've got all my long-winded points and you've got all your points.
[01:36:10.615 --> 01:36:14.557]  Finishing up with what you expect to happen now, because here are some of the headlines.
[01:36:15.397 --> 01:36:20.518]  It's official, banks in Europe may now seize deposits to cover their gambling losses.
[01:36:20.518 --> 01:36:34.542]  And I tune into our news, Fox Radio, CNN, they're like, boy, Cyprus and the Cypriots got the help they needed, a bailout, when it's not their bailout, it's pure global mafia robbing a bank to
[01:36:35.242 --> 01:36:36.462]  Prop up the EU.
[01:36:36.462 --> 01:36:37.062]  Here's another one.
[01:36:37.062 --> 01:36:38.523]  Europe.
[01:36:38.523 --> 01:36:41.003]  100,000 savings, now considered wealthy.
[01:36:41.003 --> 01:36:44.604]  Everybody above that, 40%, peeled out of your account.
[01:36:44.604 --> 01:36:47.124]  And as Joel was just pointing out, the rich had already gotten the word.
[01:36:47.124 --> 01:36:48.365]  They're all exempt.
[01:36:48.365 --> 01:36:49.665]  The truly rich.
[01:36:49.665 --> 01:36:51.905]  It's the middle class they want to shut down.
[01:36:51.905 --> 01:36:54.886]  It's always the mega-rich robbing the middle class.
[01:36:54.886 --> 01:36:58.847]  That's what Bill Gates, all of them, that's what Warren Buffett's about when he says raise taxes.
[01:36:58.847 --> 01:36:59.747]  He gets bailout money.
[01:37:00.567 --> 01:37:03.170]  Cyprus bank bailout agreement is pure theft.
[01:37:03.170 --> 01:37:07.214]  40% of private deposits to be looted from selected accounts.
[01:37:07.214 --> 01:37:08.175]  Words of warning.
[01:37:08.175 --> 01:37:11.258]  Get your money out of European banks.
[01:37:11.258 --> 01:37:17.264]  That's just some of the headlines that are up on InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[01:37:17.264 --> 01:37:19.987]  But Cyprus strikes last minute EU bailout deal.
[01:37:19.987 --> 01:37:20.968]  London Guardian.
[01:37:20.968 --> 01:37:22.370]  It is not a bailout.
[01:37:22.950 --> 01:37:27.896]  A bailout would be a bank coming and bailing out the country that has bad credit.
[01:37:27.896 --> 01:37:34.745]  But the very banks are giving us bad credit ratings, while they themselves are the black holes of the derivatives.
[01:37:34.745 --> 01:37:38.290]  You know, Joel, I know you've studied and written about this for decades.
[01:37:38.290 --> 01:37:40.092]  Again, if you just joined us, Joel Skousen was...
[01:37:41.313 --> 01:37:44.774]  Navy, Marine Corps aviator, Vietnam carrier guy.
[01:37:44.774 --> 01:37:48.815]  We're going to talk about his crash landing a few weeks ago here in a moment.
[01:37:48.815 --> 01:37:54.036]  But you hear me throwing all this out, the sense of alarm in my voice.
[01:37:54.036 --> 01:37:57.237]  Why are they so bold as to start doing this?
[01:37:57.237 --> 01:38:03.139]  Is it a test to see if they can get the media to just normalize this new direct taxation to the globalist?
[01:38:04.349 --> 01:38:06.470]  Well, Alex, they actually had no other choice.
[01:38:06.470 --> 01:38:08.230]  There wasn't any money to extract.
[01:38:08.230 --> 01:38:17.613]  Normally, as in Ireland, they required the taxpayers to pick up the tab for a portion of the bailout on condition of them giving European money into them.
[01:38:17.613 --> 01:38:22.174]  They, in fact, did hand over 20 billion euros from the
[01:38:23.294 --> 01:38:36.482]  The banking system, the central bank and the IMF to these banks to make them whole and they liquidated one and took money what was remaining in that bank and gave it over to another one.
[01:38:36.482 --> 01:38:39.964]  Remember that the 40% is only an average Alec.
[01:38:39.964 --> 01:38:46.428]  Some people lost everything in this and the highest senior bond stakeholders maybe lost 10%.
[01:38:46.428 --> 01:38:46.709]  So it was
[01:38:52.506 --> 01:38:54.568]  Now, we just lost Joel Skousen again.
[01:38:54.568 --> 01:38:57.951]  We'll get him reconnected via Skype.
[01:38:57.951 --> 01:38:58.592]  Hey, it's worth it.
[01:38:58.592 --> 01:39:02.636]  It sounds better than phone line.
[01:39:02.636 --> 01:39:09.383]  Now, again, ladies and gentlemen, this is affecting the entire global economy.
[01:39:09.383 --> 01:39:15.289]  And yes, the EU does not allow
[01:39:18.179 --> 01:39:23.743]  At least on paper, for governments to then bail themselves out.
[01:39:23.743 --> 01:39:27.245]  So how it's done is, they just take it directly out of the bank accounts.
[01:39:28.955 --> 01:39:32.258]  Truly, truly unprecedented that all of this is going on.
[01:39:32.258 --> 01:39:35.520]  And I watch television, I listen to the news.
[01:39:35.520 --> 01:39:38.402]  The average American would have no idea.
[01:39:38.402 --> 01:39:47.329]  In fact, I probably heard Fox News Radio seven or eight times this weekend, and it was like, yeah, tough bailout plan in Cyprus, but the country's saved.
[01:39:47.329 --> 01:39:51.793]  And then meanwhile, you read deeper, they're now admitting the country is even in worse shape.
[01:39:53.018 --> 01:39:58.863]  And this is not going to bail them out at all.
[01:39:58.863 --> 01:40:07.951]  Moody says, even with the New Deal, even with the New Deal, Cyprus could still default and leave the Euro.
[01:40:07.951 --> 01:40:14.576]  Joel, we've got you back here, back with radio connection here to the carrier base as you're flying in.
[01:40:14.576 --> 01:40:17.899]  You cut out when you mentioned the point about some people lost everything.
[01:40:17.899 --> 01:40:20.101]  See, my mind isn't even computing that.
[01:40:21.829 --> 01:40:28.177]  In fact, they talk about that in psychological warfare, how our minds tend to automatically lessen how bad something is.
[01:40:28.177 --> 01:40:31.761]  I forget the name of that, but I guess it's called denial.
[01:40:31.761 --> 01:40:32.262]  That's right.
[01:40:32.262 --> 01:40:33.724]  People accuse me of exaggerating.
[01:40:33.724 --> 01:40:34.525]  It's worse than that.
[01:40:34.525 --> 01:40:35.887]  Some people had everything taken.
[01:40:35.887 --> 01:40:36.227]  Go ahead.
[01:40:37.168 --> 01:40:37.769]  That's right.
[01:40:37.769 --> 01:40:46.236]  As I say, it was an average of 40% and most of the medium-sized, middle-class, wealthy lost everything.
[01:40:46.236 --> 01:40:52.320]  The senior bondholders had a stake probably no more than about 10% that they had to give up.
[01:40:52.320 --> 01:40:59.446]  But you're absolutely right in the analysis that Cyprus simply has no income to service this additional debt.
[01:40:59.446 --> 01:41:03.490]  They're taking the debt, but they're going to have to give more bailouts until the gas
[01:41:04.170 --> 01:41:05.151]  comes back on
[01:41:21.318 --> 01:41:23.760]  Savers are saying that they're next.
[01:41:23.760 --> 01:41:40.633]  I think you're going to see some pretty stiff runs on the banks in Spain and Portugal and Italy as they transfer money out of those banks into the safer German and Swiss banks because they know now that everybody's at risk of having their deposits grabbed.
[01:41:40.633 --> 01:41:42.534]  Now, I want to mention one other thing.
[01:41:42.534 --> 01:41:45.176]  I've had a long history of people asking me advice
[01:41:45.796 --> 01:41:49.318]  I keep telling them, don't put your money in overseas bank accounts.
[01:41:49.318 --> 01:41:53.040]  Everybody wants to avoid the IRS trap here and get the money overseas.
[01:41:53.040 --> 01:41:58.343]  And I said, someday you're going to lose it because they're simply going to cut off access.
[01:41:58.343 --> 01:42:07.729]  And this has made believers, and a lot of them, you're going to see a run on overseas bank accounts, repatriating it back into the United States.
[01:42:07.729 --> 01:42:09.830]  And so short term, this will probably help the dollar?
[01:42:10.971 --> 01:42:11.792]  Absolutely.
[01:42:11.792 --> 01:42:27.032]  You know, the dollar is being helped right now by the fact that most countries are inflating much higher than the dollar percentage-wise, and that's why gold and silver are flat and slightly declining, because the dollar is looking strong relative to all of the other weaker currencies.
[01:42:27.892 --> 01:42:33.195]  I know you're familiar with Dr. Paul Craig Roberts, former head of the Treasury and Policy, the father of economics.
[01:42:33.195 --> 01:42:34.815]  He says it's a triple bubble.
[01:42:34.815 --> 01:42:36.836]  I mean, obviously, that's true.
[01:42:36.836 --> 01:42:39.598]  Bonds, and then, of course, you've got stocks.
[01:42:42.830 --> 01:42:49.912]  There's really more than three bubbles if you count real estate and other things, but what is your take on how long this can go?
[01:42:49.912 --> 01:42:59.294]  Because obviously it's being orchestrated at many levels, but if Cyprus and Europe really are having real problems, couldn't that cause a chain reaction at first?
[01:42:59.294 --> 01:43:05.075]  It will make us buoy, but won't it cause problems after that first bubbling effect?
[01:43:06.343 --> 01:43:09.286]  Well, it could if they failed to support it.
[01:43:09.286 --> 01:43:15.712]  I mean, they've got enough means with the huge dollar base that they have to continue to inflate.
[01:43:15.712 --> 01:43:22.980]  The Fed can throw out almost $9 trillion a year and not exceed 10% inflation of the money supply.
[01:43:22.980 --> 01:43:25.903]  So they've got a tremendous power to continue to bail out.
[01:43:25.903 --> 01:43:29.826]  The great danger is if they get into a high inflation situation,
[01:43:30.767 --> 01:43:35.889]  It would force interest rates up, which would collapse the phony recovery that we're seeing.
[01:43:35.889 --> 01:43:40.110]  So I think they're going to work very, very hard to keep bailouts to the minimum.
[01:43:40.110 --> 01:43:47.093]  That's why they had to take some of these deposits instead of make it a pure bailout, so there wasn't as inflationary on the euro.
[01:43:47.093 --> 01:43:53.975]  But they can keep going, and I believe they're going to do whatever it takes to keep going until war comes, because war gives them cover.
[01:43:54.821 --> 01:43:58.142]  They don't get the blame for any banking collapse then.
[01:43:58.142 --> 01:43:59.623]  It's the war that causes it.
[01:43:59.623 --> 01:44:06.285]  So I think we're going to see it stretch out until Russia and China finally attack the West.
[01:44:06.285 --> 01:44:10.226]  Let me raise that issue with you, because I talked to them about the Koch brothers last hour.
[01:44:10.226 --> 01:44:14.567]  I'm always being accused of working for them with no proof, so I did some research on them.
[01:44:14.567 --> 01:44:15.868]  And they're globalist.
[01:44:15.868 --> 01:44:18.949]  They're tied into some of the big foundations.
[01:44:18.949 --> 01:44:22.870]  But they are fighting agenda 21 and the shutdown of their own plants.
[01:44:23.450 --> 01:44:30.833]  Which even if you hate wealthy people, folks, it's going to increase your gas prices if they shut down the refineries and the coal plants and things.
[01:44:30.833 --> 01:44:33.255]  But they're the favorite demon.
[01:44:33.255 --> 01:44:41.758]  But then I look at Soros and people, and Berkshire Hathaway, shutting down the Keystone Pipeline, making sure China gets that oil.
[01:44:41.758 --> 01:44:43.339]  So they make the profits.
[01:44:43.339 --> 01:44:47.821]  I agree with you that it's obviously China, Russia, and the Anglo-American establishment as blocks.
[01:44:47.821 --> 01:44:50.102]  You've got the BRICS in between Russia and China.
[01:44:52.040 --> 01:44:55.583]  Those two authoritarian groups don't trust each other either.
[01:44:55.583 --> 01:45:02.367]  What is the point of de-industrializing America if the globalists, you know, aren't in full control of China?
[01:45:02.367 --> 01:45:09.813]  Why are they putting so many eggs, giving them the Panama Canal, just giving them everything, giving them all our deepwater ports on the West Coast?
[01:45:09.813 --> 01:45:12.275]  I mean, it is just incredible.
[01:45:12.275 --> 01:45:15.297]  A foreign air force couldn't bomb out our factories this bad.
[01:45:16.445 --> 01:45:21.613]  Well, I really don't believe that the Anglo-American establishment controls China.
[01:45:21.613 --> 01:45:31.488]  I believe China is an independent predator, but I think that they have been helping build an enemy in help as they have built Russia and helped Russia
[01:45:32.049 --> 01:45:36.491]  Since the very beginning of the revolution, they're still continuing to help China.
[01:45:36.491 --> 01:45:45.134]  And that's why we've seen, as I covered in the World Affairs Briefs, they continue to hire Chinese scientists into NASA research.
[01:45:45.134 --> 01:45:48.256]  They continue to have exchanges into our weapons laboratories.
[01:45:48.256 --> 01:45:54.138]  They're really trying to make sure they get all the technology they need to have the confidence to threaten the West.
[01:45:54.138 --> 01:45:59.080]  Now, the number I saw was 10,000, and they just let them go right back with all the secrets knowingly.
[01:45:59.960 --> 01:46:09.687]  And they continue to hand out visas like water to Chinese students coming over to our top universities and they do very well in science and they take back those secrets there too.
[01:46:09.687 --> 01:46:27.319]  But you know there's a major sea change happening right now in Russia and I'm going to do a special edition of the World Affairs Brief coming out this Friday on what the Berezovsky assassination means and what they have in store for the two other competitors.
[01:46:31.842 --> 01:46:40.807]  Okay, you just got to my next question, which I hadn't told you yet.
[01:46:40.807 --> 01:46:52.575]  Obviously, so many people get killed, assassinated, and you know it's an assassination when, as soon as it comes out, there's not even an autopsy, they say no foul play, no evidence,
[01:46:53.956 --> 01:46:58.341]  That Borovosky was killed, say police, locked in the bathroom.
[01:46:58.341 --> 01:47:04.527]  That's proof that he killed himself with a scarf next to him, which would be a clear message that he was killed.
[01:47:04.527 --> 01:47:07.530]  A big enemy of Putin, at least on the surface.
[01:47:07.530 --> 01:47:10.033]  Geopolitically, Joel Skousen, what does this mean?
[01:47:11.291 --> 01:47:21.456]  Well, you know, I had believed for many years because, you know, Putin met with Berezovsky, according to Spanish intelligence, five times the year he ascended to the presidency.
[01:47:21.456 --> 01:47:27.219]  So clearly Putin was a Berezovsky minion when he started out.
[01:47:27.219 --> 01:47:28.100]  But at some point,
[01:47:28.760 --> 01:47:30.801]  Putin and Berezovsky had a falling out.
[01:47:30.801 --> 01:47:32.282]  I thought it was political theater.
[01:47:32.282 --> 01:47:38.726]  I thought it would be stupid for Berezovsky to say from his London villa that he was going to finance a coup against Putin.
[01:47:38.726 --> 01:47:42.528]  I mean, nobody would do that publicly if they were intending to do it.
[01:47:42.528 --> 01:47:51.173]  But with the assassination of Litvinenko and Berezovsky now, two who were very close,
[01:47:52.406 --> 01:48:04.338]  And Lipdenenko had in fact fingered a lot of the KGB, FSB, phony bombings of apartments in order to justify their war on terror in Chechnya.
[01:48:04.338 --> 01:48:11.165]  He became put on a list for assassination and they took him out and Berezovsky did himself.
[01:48:11.165 --> 01:48:13.747]  But interestingly enough, both Abramovich
[01:48:14.668 --> 01:48:24.736]  And Khodorkovsky, the two younger wealthy oligarchs who are the wealthiest, not counting Kaczynski of the media king there in Russia.
[01:48:24.736 --> 01:48:30.920]  These people both got their start into being wealthy through Boris Berezovsky.
[01:48:31.961 --> 01:48:42.109]  And of course Berezovsky lost this major court battle with Abramovich even though he had basically given him the stock and made Abramovich rich.
[01:48:42.109 --> 01:48:46.212]  Abramovich took a run with it and essentially cut Berezovsky out.
[01:48:47.273 --> 01:48:53.995]  Khodorkovsky and Yukos Oil also did his deal with Berezovsky and apparently cut him out as well.
[01:48:53.995 --> 01:48:58.196]  So it looked like there's some major infighting between two other factions.
[01:48:58.196 --> 01:48:59.497]  Putin may be a third.
[01:48:59.497 --> 01:49:01.498]  I'm not sure which one he's aligned with.
[01:49:03.138 --> 01:49:05.160]  But this is very serious.
[01:49:05.160 --> 01:49:08.903]  The Anglo-American establishment also got their fingers in the pie.
[01:49:08.903 --> 01:49:19.851]  I found out that Mikhail Khodorkovsky had sold or given, I'm sorry, given his shares in Yukos Oil to Jacob Rothschild.
[01:49:20.851 --> 01:49:27.339]  Major player in the Anglo-American establishment, just before he was indicted, and when he went to prison.
[01:49:27.339 --> 01:49:34.286]  So essentially... That's happened repeatedly, and the Rothschilds sue if people claim that, but then have lost the lawsuits.
[01:49:34.286 --> 01:49:37.090]  So that's been reported in the Financial Times of London, absolutely.
[01:49:37.090 --> 01:49:38.772]  How powerful are the Rothschilds?
[01:49:40.134 --> 01:49:46.796]  Well, I think they are the key base of money operations of the globalists.
[01:49:46.796 --> 01:49:48.637]  And there is a major U.S.
[01:49:48.637 --> 01:49:51.938]  component to that now, which competes with them to a certain extent.
[01:49:51.938 --> 01:49:57.620]  But I think the Rothschilds are the biggest financial base of the New World Order that we're dealing with.
[01:49:57.620 --> 01:49:58.700]  What is their ideology?
[01:49:58.700 --> 01:50:01.181]  Because, you know, they're reportedly at least part Jewish.
[01:50:01.181 --> 01:50:03.422]  They've married into some of the royalty over there.
[01:50:03.422 --> 01:50:06.983]  But I always see them also funding eugenics and just really nasty stuff.
[01:50:08.680 --> 01:50:18.326]  Well, I think their ideology is globalist, which means that they're socialist of the variety that believes in milking capitalism, not destroying it, not nationalizing.
[01:50:18.326 --> 01:50:20.827]  It's a Fabian type of socialism.
[01:50:20.827 --> 01:50:24.329]  But they also play, as you know, the Hegelian dialectic, playing both sides.
[01:50:24.329 --> 01:50:29.012]  They've got their fingers in the Russian conspiracy this time.
[01:50:29.012 --> 01:50:35.636]  What's interesting is that Khodorkovsky is, in fact, the one who's promoting the return of communism.
[01:50:35.976 --> 01:50:37.277]  That's right.
[01:50:37.277 --> 01:50:40.298]  And it was Rothschilds that helped finance communism.
[01:50:40.298 --> 01:50:41.119]  That's right.
[01:50:41.119 --> 01:50:47.362]  But whether or not he really represents the underground communists that right now control Putin, Putin is not running the show.
[01:50:47.362 --> 01:50:48.422]  Putin is a puppet.
[01:50:48.422 --> 01:50:52.464]  He runs from the major communist conspiracy to fake their own demise.
[01:50:52.464 --> 01:50:52.884]  Well, stay there.
[01:50:52.884 --> 01:50:53.765]  Let's break that down.
[01:50:53.765 --> 01:50:56.606]  If we can't hold you into the next hour to cover the plane crash.
[01:50:56.606 --> 01:50:58.807]  Believe me, it was incredible.
[01:50:58.807 --> 01:50:59.448]  We'll be right back.
[01:50:59.448 --> 01:50:59.848]  Stay with us.
[01:51:01.658 --> 01:51:05.443]  If you're listening, you know your basic freedoms are being threatened every day.
[01:51:05.443 --> 01:51:08.687]  If you're listening, you know the economy is not getting better.
[01:51:08.687 --> 01:51:11.491]  You know gas and food prices are skyrocketing.
[01:51:11.491 --> 01:51:13.634]  Now is the time to get prepared.
[01:51:13.634 --> 01:51:16.478]  For years we've told you about our friends at eFoods Direct.

[01:52:00.834 --> 01:52:04.797]  Gardeners, here comes another growing season, but don't use last year's soil.
[01:52:04.797 --> 01:52:08.359]  Maximize yields in your survival garden with EM-1 from Terragamics.
[01:52:08.359 --> 01:52:18.025]  EM-1 is an organic soil conditioner, fertilizer amendment, and compost accelerant that provides a broad spectrum of beneficial microorganisms, enzymes, trace minerals, vitamins, and various organic acids.
[01:52:18.465 --> 01:52:23.809]  EM-1 helps regulate the soil's pH level and its soil microbes, improving moisture retention and drought tolerance.
[01:52:23.809 --> 01:52:25.750]  Remember last year's dry conditions?
[01:52:25.750 --> 01:52:30.633]  EM-1 from Terragonics is safe, chemical free, and certified for use on all organic farms.
[01:52:30.633 --> 01:52:37.938]  It improves plant quality, size, color, flavor, and gives up to 20% more nutrient value in fruits and vegetables, and greatly increases shelf life.
[01:52:37.938 --> 01:52:40.880]  And EM-1 is so simple to use, just mix with water and apply.
[01:52:41.220 --> 01:52:44.182]  Hello, this is Ty Bollinger, author of the best-selling book, Cancer Step Outside the Box.
[01:52:44.182 --> 01:52:46.765]  I want you to know some very important information.
[01:53:08.312 --> 01:53:17.276]  In 1985, President Ronald Reagan requested that Carnivora be sent directly to the White House at a time when only the President could obtain this world-class healer.
[01:53:17.276 --> 01:53:22.198]  Now, 27 years later, Carnivora capsules are used around the world to keep people healthy.
[01:53:22.831 --> 01:53:34.194]  Now you can protect yourself and your loved ones in this age of superbugs with 17 naturally occurring compounds that instinctively respond to abnormal cells only without harming a single normal cell.
[01:53:34.194 --> 01:53:41.196]  If you want to stay healthy, now's your chance to literally wake up your critical immune cells to attack harmful invaders that don't belong in your body.
[01:53:41.876 --> 01:53:46.179]  Call 1-866-VENUSFLY or order from carnivora.com.
[01:53:46.179 --> 01:53:49.782]  That's C-A-R-N-I-V-O-R-A dot com.

[01:53:57.047 --> 01:53:58.307]  Protect your immune system.
[01:53:58.307 --> 01:53:59.368]  It's the only one you've got.
[01:54:06.758 --> 01:54:07.279]  Yeah.
[01:54:13.829 --> 01:54:15.370]  Monday through Friday from 11 a.m.
[01:54:15.370 --> 01:54:15.971]  to 2 p.m.
[01:54:15.971 --> 01:54:17.532]  We're here live weeknights.
[01:54:17.532 --> 01:54:20.734]  We're back 7 o'clock central with InfoWars Nightly News.
[01:54:20.734 --> 01:54:25.777]  You can find all the details at InfoWarsNews.com or PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:54:25.777 --> 01:54:29.459]  You can get 11 memberships for $5.95 a month.
[01:54:29.459 --> 01:54:30.900]  It's a master membership.
[01:54:30.900 --> 01:54:36.304]  You can share with up to 11 people simultaneously, yourself and 10 others.
[01:54:36.304 --> 01:54:39.766]  Very few will tune in every night at the same time, so you probably share it with 20, 30 people.
[01:54:41.227 --> 01:54:44.370]  And it doesn't work sometimes, just get another membership.
[01:54:44.370 --> 01:54:45.951]  Great way to wake people up.
[01:54:45.951 --> 01:54:51.115]  Very well produced, hard-hitting, nightly news, 7 o'clock Central, 8 o'clock Eastern.
[01:54:51.115 --> 01:54:53.357]  We also come back Sundays, 4 to 6 p.m.
[01:54:53.357 --> 01:54:55.839]  Joel's gonna be with us 20 minutes into the next hour.
[01:54:55.839 --> 01:54:58.201]  I thought I'd take a few phone calls for Joel.
[01:54:58.841 --> 01:55:03.124]  After we come back in the next hour and tell his plane crash story, a few phone calls for Joel.
[01:55:03.124 --> 01:55:07.167]  If you've got any questions, his website is worldaffairsbrief.com.
[01:55:07.167 --> 01:55:11.410]  Our sites are infowars.com and prisonplanet.tv.
[01:55:11.410 --> 01:55:14.052]  And again, you're listening to the Alex Jones Show here.
[01:55:14.052 --> 01:55:19.275]  After he leaves us, I've got a bunch of news and your phone calls I'm going to get back into.
[01:55:19.275 --> 01:55:25.860]  Joel, before we start the next hour and get into your plane crash and some other issues, it just seems like everything is accelerating.
[01:55:25.860 --> 01:55:27.401]  More murders, more hits.
[01:55:28.542 --> 01:55:33.066]  More corruption, government going wild.
[01:55:33.066 --> 01:55:36.450]  Even if it wakes people up, they want our guns.
[01:55:36.450 --> 01:55:43.497]  What is the impetus towards everything, I would say, accelerating 100% or more?
[01:55:43.497 --> 01:55:44.879]  Why is that happening in your research?
[01:55:46.832 --> 01:55:49.235]  It's hard to say, Alex.
[01:55:49.235 --> 01:56:01.230]  Despite the acceleration, there are certain fixed things that they cannot accelerate, and one of those is inducing Russia and China to attack the West, and they cannot get to a new world order without that attack.
[01:56:02.467 --> 01:56:16.115]  And so they clearly are prepping American people and prepping militaristic, whether it's mercenary types or Department of Homeland Security to take down dissidents someday.
[01:56:16.115 --> 01:56:23.219]  Even though that is accelerating tremendously, it takes a long time and a lot of people that they've got to gain to do that.
[01:56:24.059 --> 01:56:29.644]  And so what do they do if this flips around against them and we figure out there's an arms buildup?
[01:56:29.644 --> 01:56:31.886]  Couldn't that actually set them back any more?
[01:56:31.886 --> 01:56:35.629]  Because I don't just put a pretty face on this or perfume on a pig.
[01:56:35.629 --> 01:56:37.511]  I see this blowing up in their face.
[01:56:37.511 --> 01:56:39.933]  I see this actually waking people up.
[01:56:41.460 --> 01:56:42.941]  It is waking people up.
[01:56:42.941 --> 01:56:50.343]  Whether or not it wakes up anybody in Congress willing to take them to task or cut funding, that remains a very big question.
[01:56:50.343 --> 01:56:58.806]  You know, the difficulty in even cutting funding to Obamacare, our Republicans sabotaged that and funded it.
[01:56:58.806 --> 01:57:03.047]  I don't think there's enough strength to actually cut funding to DHS.
[01:57:03.047 --> 01:57:05.428]  They bring out the idea that, oh, we're
[01:57:06.568 --> 01:57:09.871]  Helping the terrorists if we cut funding to DHS.
[01:57:09.871 --> 01:57:14.714]  We're a long way from winning this battle, even with the amount of backlash that we're engendering right now.
[01:57:14.714 --> 01:57:15.715]  We have to keep it up.
[01:57:15.715 --> 01:57:17.976]  We have to put the heat on Congress.
[01:57:17.976 --> 01:57:24.361]  But it should be half of Congress demanding an answer from DHS, not just 15 congressmen.
[01:57:24.361 --> 01:57:29.605]  But it is a victory that we've gone from them stonewalling to now it being forced out into a national debate.
[01:57:30.473 --> 01:57:31.534]  Absolutely.
[01:57:31.534 --> 01:57:39.338]  It's still not a national debate yet, but they're putting heat on them, and so far they're stonewalling still.
[01:57:39.338 --> 01:57:39.878]  Well, you're right.
[01:57:39.878 --> 01:57:50.884]  I mean, it's somewhat of a national debate, but it really needs to become one on a full scale, because then it will bring us back to the common sense of why we have a Second Amendment.
[01:57:52.011 --> 01:58:07.824]  Well, whenever the media, with this much notoriety about this, with Breitbart and your website and everybody else talking about it, my website, they're not saying a thing about the 3 billion bullets or the 1.6, and that means there's a cover-up.
[01:58:07.824 --> 01:58:10.105]  They basically want this buried.
[01:58:10.105 --> 01:58:11.727]  No, but you're right, it's well over 2 billion now.
[01:58:12.327 --> 01:58:18.830]  And if you count all the other stockpiles, probably well over 3 billion that they've gotten delivered or that have been ordered.
[01:58:18.830 --> 01:58:30.235]  I want to come back briefly and talk more about the economy with you, and then at the 8 after, when we come back in that next segment, we're going with Joel Skalzin to get into his plane crash that he survived, by the grace of God.
[01:58:30.235 --> 01:58:32.116]  Pretty amazing if you haven't seen the news footage.
[01:58:32.116 --> 01:58:34.897]  Just Google Joel Skalzin and click news.
[01:58:34.897 --> 01:58:36.658]  You can see it if you're a radio listener.
[01:58:36.658 --> 01:58:37.979]  We'll be right back with a third hour.
[01:58:41.420 --> 01:58:44.922]  You are listening to GCN.

[01:59:56.211 --> 02:00:05.597]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:05.597 --> 02:00:06.898]  Big Brother.
[02:00:06.898 --> 02:00:08.679]  Mainstream media.
[02:00:08.679 --> 02:00:09.840]  Government cover-ups.

[02:00:13.563 --> 02:00:17.766]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:17.766 --> 02:00:21.829]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:23.476 --> 02:00:27.598]  Joel Skousen of World Affairs Brief is our guest for another 20-30 minutes.
[02:00:27.598 --> 02:00:29.979]  I always enjoy talking to him and going back and forth.
[02:00:29.979 --> 02:00:31.539]  Some of your phone calls coming up.
[02:00:31.539 --> 02:00:32.820]  Joel, I briefly wanted to ask you.
[02:00:32.820 --> 02:00:40.883]  We sell a video after the Tribulation that's got a bunch of different pastors on there breaking down with a Bible.
[02:00:40.883 --> 02:00:44.704]  It clearly says the rapture happens after the Antichrist is defeated.
[02:00:44.704 --> 02:00:50.147]  I was just curious what your take on this is and just guessing because I don't know your view on it.
[02:00:51.707 --> 02:01:00.114]  What do you make of how this is used regardless as a cop-out for Christians to never fight evil because the end of the world is always around the corner?
[02:01:00.114 --> 02:01:12.744]  I think more and more, you know, the fact that Christians across this country think that God's going to handle it all, that's the main reason they won't ever stand up against the total takeover because they think the end of the world's next week.
[02:01:12.744 --> 02:01:14.185]  Well, I agree this is a problem.
[02:01:14.185 --> 02:01:19.609]  It's something that, you know, I struggle with a lot of my Christian friends who have that
[02:01:20.672 --> 02:01:27.894]  You know, kind of a benign, benevolent apathy that God's in charge and therefore we don't have to worry.
[02:01:27.894 --> 02:01:47.359]  Well, you may not have to worry about your salvation if you're born again, if you're committed to Christ, but you will fear in the last days because I'm a belief that there's never been any time in history that God has not put his own people through the fire of adversity in order to strengthen them, to make them stronger.
[02:01:47.359 --> 02:01:48.940]  This earth is a test life.
[02:01:49.640 --> 02:01:59.734]  It's to test ourselves to see how we will respond to the promptings of the Spirit of the Lord as it guides us through difficult times.
[02:01:59.734 --> 02:02:03.039]  And I personally think that we're going to go through the Tribulation.
[02:02:03.039 --> 02:02:04.781]  I don't believe in the Cadillac Rapture.
[02:02:06.048 --> 02:02:06.349]  I think?
[02:02:21.887 --> 02:02:31.562]  Upon this planet and only the intervention of God sending his son again the second time will stop Satan's wholesale control of the world.
[02:02:31.562 --> 02:02:32.203]  So how does it work?
[02:02:32.203 --> 02:02:37.351]  They stage a nuclear war and then the Anglo-American establishment takes tries to take over the planet with the Antichrist?
[02:02:38.757 --> 02:02:48.165]  Yes, I believe that they're going to come out of their bunkers after this war starts with a nuclear strike on military targets and they're going to say, you know, the Russians and Chinese deceived us.
[02:02:48.165 --> 02:02:49.606]  We didn't know this was coming.
[02:02:49.606 --> 02:02:52.188]  That's a lie, of course.
[02:02:52.188 --> 02:02:54.810]  And they'll say the only way to save ourselves now is to
[02:02:56.011 --> 02:03:04.055]  To join in a militarized New World Order with the League of Democracies is some of the new euphemistic sounding name for United Nations.
[02:03:04.055 --> 02:03:07.137]  NATO will probably become the shock troops of the United Nations.
[02:03:07.137 --> 02:03:10.299]  We'll bring out our secret weapon systems that we've been developing.
[02:03:11.079 --> 02:03:17.467]  Not use them to protect the United States, but use them to militarize this world army.
[02:03:17.467 --> 02:03:29.342]  And during this war, I think you'll see the government turn on its own people and say, you know, there are people among us that are not supporting this war, not supporting our troops, that complain that we, the government, knew this was happening, that we're part of the problem.
[02:03:30.097 --> 02:03:33.262]  Those people need to be rounded up and we call upon all Americans.
[02:03:33.262 --> 02:03:33.923]  No, exactly.
[02:03:33.923 --> 02:03:40.314]  The New World Order will use it to go after their own domestic groups that aren't evil and they'll use it to take over the planet.
[02:03:40.314 --> 02:03:41.296]  That's exactly what they do.
[02:03:42.677 --> 02:03:43.157]  That's right.
[02:03:43.157 --> 02:03:46.758]  And at some point, you know, it ends up with the Battle of Armageddon.
[02:03:46.758 --> 02:03:55.221]  There's going to be a major conflict in the Middle East that will... And I don't think the current conflict, even the attack on Iran, will lead directly to World War III.
[02:03:55.221 --> 02:04:00.242]  I think North Korea is being preserved as the trigger event for that war.
[02:04:00.242 --> 02:04:02.643]  And that China and Russia aren't ready yet.
[02:04:02.643 --> 02:04:03.303]  And so I think
[02:04:04.204 --> 02:04:17.599]  But one thing that the further intervention in the Middle East will do, as it's being done here in Syria and then Iran, it will solidify our reputation as the bully of the world, handing to Russia and China the excuse to attack the West someday.
[02:04:18.561 --> 02:04:24.725]  You know what really, why I know God's real and all this is real, not just personal experiences and discernment?
[02:04:24.725 --> 02:04:29.888]  When I study the globalists, they are all, at the final equation, Luciferians.
[02:04:29.888 --> 02:04:39.314]  Well, how is there not a Lucifer, if the establishment wants us to be atheists, we don't even know this game's going on, and then the top people, they know Lucifer's in charge.
[02:04:39.314 --> 02:04:41.595]  They believe Lucifer's given them power.
[02:04:41.595 --> 02:04:45.898]  All these globalists, when you really look into what they believe, they think they've been given power by Lucifer.
[02:04:48.473 --> 02:04:50.235]  It's amazing.
[02:04:50.235 --> 02:04:53.920]  We'll be right back, ladies and gentlemen, after this quick break with Joel Skalzin.
[02:04:53.920 --> 02:04:55.382]  I am your host, Alex Jones.
[02:04:55.382 --> 02:04:55.882]  Call for you number 800-259-9231.
[02:05:01.480 --> 02:05:02.541]  I had tried everything.
[02:05:02.541 --> 02:05:08.028]  I'd cut back the amount of food I was eating, I was lifting weights and jogging, but nothing was working.
[02:05:08.028 --> 02:05:12.874]  My body was literally starving for minerals and trace elements as well as key vitamins.
[02:05:12.874 --> 02:05:19.242]  And as soon as I had that, I immediately could eat half of what I was eating previously and be satisfied.
[02:05:19.722 --> 02:05:30.926]  Now there are hundreds of great products at Infowarsteam.com, but I want to point out the three that have helped me lose 37 pounds in just two months.
[02:05:30.926 --> 02:05:35.408]  Products like Beyond Tangy Tangerine, Pollen Burst, and Rebound.
[02:05:35.408 --> 02:05:38.409]  When I started taking the Tangy Tangerine and other products every day,
[02:05:38.769 --> 02:05:41.651]  I lost more than 37 pounds in just two months.
[02:05:41.651 --> 02:05:43.232]  Now that's results.
[02:05:43.232 --> 02:05:50.017]  I want to challenge my listeners to go to Infowarsteam.com and to order just three of their products.

[02:08:03.371 --> 02:08:06.013]  Waging war on corruption.
[02:08:06.013 --> 02:08:14.401]  It's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the Infowar.
[02:08:14.401 --> 02:08:19.485]  We're really seeing unprecedented things happening, but there's also good news.
[02:08:19.485 --> 02:08:29.935]  You know, the two Texas state troopers that pulled over, the two attractive young women that used the same glove to, on video, go inside their bodies, they've been indicted by the grand jury.
[02:08:30.888 --> 02:08:42.954]  The state police commandant and the local commanders all endorsed this and said, you know, we're now going to use the same glove and violate you without a warrant.
[02:08:42.954 --> 02:08:45.216]  But the grand jury up in North Texas is indicting them.
[02:08:45.905 --> 02:08:51.091]  See, we have the jury box, the grand jury box, the jury box, we have the cartridge box as well.
[02:08:51.091 --> 02:08:51.991]  I don't want to go there.
[02:08:51.991 --> 02:08:56.496]  We have the pen, which is mightier than the sword, and the average police aren't even bad.
[02:08:56.496 --> 02:08:58.418]  They're trying to find bad ones.
[02:08:58.418 --> 02:09:01.521]  There's a real fight going on for the heart and soul of humanity right now.
[02:09:02.740 --> 02:09:07.964]  And I've had success in my own life fighting tyranny, so I know you can have success.
[02:09:07.964 --> 02:09:15.650]  Lord knows, I mean, my attempts to fight tyranny are ham-fisted and downright obnoxious looking at times, but you know what?
[02:09:15.650 --> 02:09:20.494]  My heart is good, I'm really trying to do good, and it's had a great effect.
[02:09:20.494 --> 02:09:22.776]  And the same thing for you out there.
[02:09:22.776 --> 02:09:29.281]  This is an incredible life, and people are so unchallenged out there, especially young people now, they don't believe
[02:09:29.921 --> 02:09:37.612]  You know, that I was able to sneak in Bohemian Grove or cover military drills or, you know, have big effects or help defeat legislation.
[02:09:37.612 --> 02:09:40.296]  It just must all be fake because everything's fake.
[02:09:40.296 --> 02:09:40.997]  No, it's not fake.
[02:09:40.997 --> 02:09:43.581]  There's different forces at work in this world.
[02:09:43.581 --> 02:09:44.422]  Take Joel Skousen.
[02:09:45.203 --> 02:09:48.645]  You know, his uncle helped expose how the mega-rich were funding communism.
[02:09:48.645 --> 02:09:49.765]  He got laughed at at the time.
[02:09:49.765 --> 02:09:51.426]  Now it's well known.
[02:09:51.426 --> 02:09:57.869]  Take Joel Skousen, you know, went off, joined the Marines as a fighter-bomber pilot landing on aircraft carriers.
[02:09:57.869 --> 02:10:01.850]  I can't imagine if people know how hard and dangerous that is.
[02:10:01.850 --> 02:10:02.631]  And like, you know,
[02:10:03.925 --> 02:10:12.550]  Just what a balancing act it is for people that can't even believe that I could sneak in Bohemian Grove when it was a piece of cake past the Secret Service.
[02:10:12.550 --> 02:10:18.614]  It's just this idea that less and less are people actual doers on the field.
[02:10:18.614 --> 02:10:23.437]  It is a culture of spectators where they just think government is God and can do whatever it wants.
[02:10:23.437 --> 02:10:30.021]  Now, that said, I want to take a few calls for Joel Skousen here until the bottom of the hour and then I'm going to cover a bunch of
[02:10:31.022 --> 02:10:44.007]  News and special reports that we've been covering, but the toll-free number to join us on air if you have a question or comment for Joel Skousen is 800-259-9231.
[02:10:44.007 --> 02:10:51.950]  Now, here are a few of the headlines that we have up on InfoWars.com right now.
[02:10:51.950 --> 02:10:55.031]  McCain gets behind Senate attack on Second Amendment.
[02:10:55.031 --> 02:10:57.032]  Folks, they're coming after our gods.
[02:10:57.572 --> 02:11:02.755]  Banning semi-autos, banning high-capacity mags, banning private sale.
[02:11:02.755 --> 02:11:03.476]  I mean, they're coming.
[02:11:03.476 --> 02:11:05.037]  So just realize we're in deep trouble.
[02:11:05.037 --> 02:11:06.838]  Call Congress.
[02:11:06.838 --> 02:11:13.322]  DHS to buy 360,000 more rounds of hollow-point ammunition as their cover-up implodes.
[02:11:13.322 --> 02:11:14.883]  That's at InfoWars.com.
[02:11:14.883 --> 02:11:18.045]  It's also top story on DrugsReport.com.
[02:11:18.045 --> 02:11:21.548]  Neocon war addiction threatens our future.
[02:11:21.548 --> 02:11:24.870]  Ron Paul has a new article out we have at InfoWars.com.
[02:11:26.665 --> 02:11:36.750]  Europe, again, anyone with over 100,000 euros in the bank is to have 40% to all of their money to be taken, to be transferred to the mega-rich.
[02:11:36.750 --> 02:11:38.451]  Cyprus bank bailout.
[02:11:38.451 --> 02:11:40.412]  Again, this is all happening.
[02:11:40.412 --> 02:11:43.234]  And our news won't even say that they're taking money.
[02:11:43.234 --> 02:11:45.335]  They just call it a bailout.
[02:11:45.335 --> 02:11:46.716]  Cyprus is happy.
[02:11:46.716 --> 02:11:48.096]  They've gotten their bailout.
[02:11:48.096 --> 02:11:53.759]  Now, Joel, I want to take a few phone calls here for you today.
[02:11:53.759 --> 02:11:54.540]  But first off,
[02:11:55.400 --> 02:12:04.827]  You were on with us about a week and a half ago and didn't even tell us that a day or two before you had what the local news and the FAA and the police called miraculous.
[02:12:04.827 --> 02:12:22.219]  And you know, you just talked about the Russian oligarch saying that was a killing and I agree with you and I know you're not a paranoid type guy and I mean, perhaps this can happen with the type of aircraft you were flying, but tell us about the aircraft, where it happened, what happened and just, I mean,
[02:12:22.839 --> 02:12:31.423]  I saw a lot of aviation sites saying that this is one in a hundred that you survived, plus you barely even got a scratch.
[02:12:31.423 --> 02:12:32.703]  That's right, Alex.
[02:12:32.703 --> 02:12:41.808]  You know, when you train both in the military and facility and flying, your worst nightmare is an engine quitting and having to put it down in a field somewhere.
[02:12:41.808 --> 02:12:43.989]  I trained for years on this.
[02:12:43.989 --> 02:12:45.149]  It finally happened to me.
[02:12:45.149 --> 02:12:45.749]  I was about 12.
[02:12:48.346 --> 02:12:53.728]  Miles away from my home airport and the engine started to falter.
[02:12:53.728 --> 02:12:57.409]  I turned on the low boost pump to try to get fuel to the engine.
[02:12:57.409 --> 02:13:02.190]  Having had some fuel clogging in one other instance with this airplane.
[02:13:02.190 --> 02:13:04.051]  Normally the low boost pump fixed it.
[02:13:04.051 --> 02:13:05.191]  It did not in this case.
[02:13:06.249 --> 02:13:12.412]  I turned on the emergency high boost pump and the engine came back to life and ran fine.
[02:13:12.412 --> 02:13:15.393]  I got into the traffic pattern of the airport.
[02:13:15.393 --> 02:13:17.714]  I pulled power back in order to slow down.
[02:13:17.714 --> 02:13:25.417]  It's a 200 mile an hour retractable airplane, pretty fast, small, experimental fiberglass sleek airplane.
[02:13:25.417 --> 02:13:29.138]  So it's not easy to slow down unless you pull power.
[02:13:29.138 --> 02:13:35.981]  Put down the landing gear and the flaps and went to put power back on the airplane to maintain altitude in it and nothing happened.
[02:13:36.661 --> 02:13:54.084]  The airplane engine just windmilled and after about 20 seconds analyzing and heading to the airport, trying to get my machine back online, checking pumps and fuel position indicators, it became obvious I wasn't going to make the field.
[02:13:54.084 --> 02:13:56.285]  Lots of cars and people in front of me.
[02:13:56.285 --> 02:14:03.426]  And so I turned left into the farming area and prepared to make an emergency landing.
[02:14:04.466 --> 02:14:18.497]  I had read an article not two weeks before in one of my flying magazines about a highly decorated Navy pilot who had killed himself because he had not maintained airspeed and had stalled and spun into the ground.
[02:14:18.497 --> 02:14:20.218]  And so that was fresh in my mind.
[02:14:20.218 --> 02:14:23.281]  I made sure, don't get slow, don't get slow.
[02:14:23.281 --> 02:14:25.863]  And I kept my speed up.
[02:14:25.863 --> 02:14:28.525]  I, as I was getting ready to touch down, um,
[02:14:30.106 --> 02:14:34.827]  I began to tumble when I hit first and I knew this was going to be very bad.
[02:14:34.827 --> 02:14:39.068]  Within a second and a half, it was all over.
[02:14:39.068 --> 02:14:43.449]  I was sitting in the middle of the wreckage on the wing that had broken off from the airplane.
[02:14:43.449 --> 02:14:47.450]  The airplane was cracked in half, shards of plexiglass all around.
[02:14:47.450 --> 02:14:50.311]  I stepped out on the ground and I was whole.
[02:14:50.311 --> 02:14:52.052]  I had nothing wrong with me.
[02:14:52.052 --> 02:14:52.712]  I was just
[02:14:53.880 --> 02:15:00.564]  Amazing if not more so because in the first impact my seatbelt broke.
[02:15:00.564 --> 02:15:06.368]  That's a 2,000 pound seatbelt and it broke and I didn't hit anything in that cockpit.
[02:15:06.368 --> 02:15:08.469]  It was a miracle.
[02:15:08.469 --> 02:15:11.151]  That is miraculous.
[02:15:11.151 --> 02:15:13.733]  That really is miraculous.
[02:15:13.733 --> 02:15:15.474]  How many times did the plane flip?
[02:15:16.496 --> 02:15:20.597]  Well, it cartwheeled approximately a time and a half.
[02:15:20.597 --> 02:15:22.958]  The wings, as I say, broke apart from the fuselage.
[02:15:22.958 --> 02:15:24.359]  The fuselage broke in half.
[02:15:24.359 --> 02:15:31.581]  In fact, if it hadn't broken in half, I would have had trouble unjamming and opening the canopy to get out of the aircraft.
[02:15:31.581 --> 02:15:35.303]  But because it broke in half, I was able to just step out on the ground.
[02:15:36.303 --> 02:15:41.788]  But as I say, when you break the seatbelt, it means you are being ejected from the airplane.
[02:15:41.788 --> 02:15:48.053]  And the seatbelt did break, but not only was I not ejected, my glasses were 200 feet away.
[02:15:48.053 --> 02:15:50.495]  But I stayed in the cockpit and didn't hit anything.
[02:15:50.495 --> 02:15:56.399]  And that's just... I don't have any explanation other than some kind of angelic airbags.
[02:15:56.399 --> 02:15:59.282]  I was about to say, did you see your guardian angel there?
[02:16:01.488 --> 02:16:03.489]  Well, my life didn't flash before me.
[02:16:03.489 --> 02:16:08.030]  I guess I'm needed to stick around for a while.
[02:16:08.030 --> 02:16:11.772]  What type of, I mean, it's a neat looking little aircraft.
[02:16:11.772 --> 02:16:13.673]  What type of aircraft was it?
[02:16:13.673 --> 02:16:15.933]  It's a glass air aircraft.
[02:16:15.933 --> 02:16:21.736]  It's a 200 mile an hour experimental aircraft, retractable gear, very fast.
[02:16:21.736 --> 02:16:25.297]  And that's what you fly around advising on secure homes around the country?
[02:16:25.765 --> 02:16:37.356]  That's right, I'm traveling all of the time because I'm busy not only in my World Affairs brief as editor, but consulting with people and designing high security residences, retreats for people.
[02:16:37.356 --> 02:16:40.780]  You know, the airplane keeps me from having to deal with TSA all of the time.
[02:16:40.780 --> 02:16:41.680]  It's a great asset.
[02:16:41.680 --> 02:16:48.987]  I'll tell you what's amazing is that you came on my show, what, a day and a half?
[02:16:48.987 --> 02:16:50.209]  And then didn't even tell us.
[02:16:50.209 --> 02:16:51.350]  It was like it was no big deal.
[02:16:52.901 --> 02:17:00.322]  Well, it was a bigger deal than my wife, certainly, who was in shock for two days.
[02:17:00.322 --> 02:17:03.743]  But, you know, I was OK.
[02:17:03.743 --> 02:17:05.483]  I thanked the Lord profusely.
[02:17:05.483 --> 02:17:06.823]  But I moved on.
[02:17:06.823 --> 02:17:12.344]  And, of course, I've been dealing with the FAA and accident investigation and all those types of things since.
[02:17:12.344 --> 02:17:17.445]  But I certainly didn't feel like I needed to advertise that I'd been in an accident.
[02:17:17.445 --> 02:17:19.786]  I did get quite a bit of notoriety nationwide.
[02:17:19.786 --> 02:17:22.066]  Survivalist survives airplane crash.
[02:17:24.793 --> 02:17:31.520]  Man, I tell you, by the grace of God, expanding on that, because I know that the, quote, authorities were amazed at first.
[02:17:31.520 --> 02:17:41.169]  What are they saying now about, I mean, I believe, just because I saw you on TV with a small scratch on your nose, was that already there?
[02:17:41.169 --> 02:17:43.731]  No, no, I did have a...
[02:17:45.310 --> 02:17:51.214]  A couple of small scratches, and I had a bruise where the seat belt was, where I broke the seat belt.
[02:17:51.214 --> 02:17:52.435]  It obviously bruised me.
[02:17:52.435 --> 02:17:55.697]  I didn't feel any of that the first day.
[02:17:55.697 --> 02:17:58.999]  Well, you must have hit really hard to break a 2,000-pound seat belt.
[02:17:58.999 --> 02:18:00.200]  Oh, absolutely.
[02:18:00.200 --> 02:18:11.147]  And as I say, not to have any broken bones and not even to hit the jagged portions of the fuselage that were just inches away from my head just had to be some divine intervention.
[02:18:12.228 --> 02:18:12.669]  Wow!
[02:18:12.669 --> 02:18:16.892]  Well, you're here to expose the New World Order today.
[02:18:16.892 --> 02:18:20.235]  The film is Strategic Relocation that I produced last year with Joel Skousen.
[02:18:20.235 --> 02:18:24.619]  It is invaluable for everyone and your purchase supports the broadcast and his work as well.
[02:18:24.619 --> 02:18:26.180]  It's available at infowarestore.com.
[02:18:26.180 --> 02:18:29.523]  You can also call toll-free 888-253-3139.
[02:18:29.523 --> 02:18:34.047]  And I want to come back and take some calls for Joel Skousen.
[02:18:34.047 --> 02:18:35.408]  In fact, I second you go to 20 after.
[02:18:35.408 --> 02:18:36.870]  Can you keep going with this a little bit longer, Joel?
[02:18:37.390 --> 02:18:38.371]  I can, Alex.
[02:18:38.371 --> 02:18:39.632]  Okay, fantastic.
[02:18:39.632 --> 02:18:42.674]  Joel Skousen, again, The Secure Home.
[02:18:42.674 --> 02:18:46.978]  That's also available at Infowarshore.com or 888-253-3139.
[02:18:46.978 --> 02:18:49.080]  And it's just good to get prepared.
[02:18:49.080 --> 02:18:55.925]  It's good to think about emergencies, so when they happen, your mind is already set in the mode of survival.
[02:18:55.925 --> 02:19:02.871]  In closing, as we go to break, I would imagine you probably saw some pretty bad crashes in Vietnam out there on those aircraft carriers.
[02:19:04.053 --> 02:19:13.838]  Yeah, in fact, I had a near miss myself where I lost power on approach to an aircraft carrier and actually went down below the deck of the level before the engine caught and finally came back up.
[02:19:13.838 --> 02:19:16.960]  It was very dramatic to see on the video camera afterwards.
[02:19:16.960 --> 02:19:18.921]  Everyone thought I was lost.
[02:19:18.921 --> 02:19:20.222]  In fact, yeah, we had dinner once.
[02:19:20.222 --> 02:19:20.922]  He told me that story.
[02:19:20.922 --> 02:19:25.665]  In fact, I think they said that was miraculous from all the things they'd seen as well.
[02:19:25.665 --> 02:19:29.627]  It's amazing how you think, you know, where am I going to put this aircraft?
[02:19:29.627 --> 02:19:32.909]  You're worried about hitting someone or killing someone.
[02:19:33.959 --> 02:19:36.240]  Fortunately, it didn't happen that day.
[02:19:36.240 --> 02:19:37.801]  That's like that movie, The Great Santini.
[02:19:37.801 --> 02:19:39.122]  You seen that?
[02:19:39.122 --> 02:19:39.943]  Yes, I have.
[02:19:39.943 --> 02:19:40.703]  Pretty good movie, huh?
[02:19:40.703 --> 02:19:41.844]  You like that movie?
[02:19:41.844 --> 02:19:42.904]  Yeah.
[02:19:42.904 --> 02:19:43.785]  Robert Duvall.
[02:19:43.785 --> 02:19:44.985]  Who doesn't like him?
[02:19:44.985 --> 02:19:46.226]  Alright, Joel Skousen.
[02:19:46.226 --> 02:19:47.367]  What a character.
[02:19:47.367 --> 02:19:49.108]  He's on our show a day and a half after.
[02:19:49.108 --> 02:19:50.429]  I'm like griping about audio.
[02:19:50.429 --> 02:19:52.970]  You gotta get a better Skype thing, which he has done.
[02:19:52.970 --> 02:19:56.352]  Meanwhile, he's literally been probably saved by angels.
[02:19:56.352 --> 02:19:58.433]  Undoubtedly, folks, protected by providence.
[02:19:58.433 --> 02:19:59.274]  Your call's coming up.
[02:20:01.306 --> 02:20:05.749]  Nothing is more American than Diamond Gusset Jeans.
[02:20:05.749 --> 02:20:07.670]  100% American made since 1987.
[02:20:07.670 --> 02:20:10.531]  Soft and broken in from the start.
[02:20:10.531 --> 02:20:14.433]  Yet more rugged and durable than any jean you've ever worn.
[02:20:14.433 --> 02:20:17.455]  Have you ever experienced missized jeans from China?
[02:20:17.455 --> 02:20:19.636]  Well you won't with Diamond Gusset.
[02:20:19.636 --> 02:20:24.719]  Every pair is crafted to fit exactly the same and always feel like they were custom made.
[02:20:24.719 --> 02:20:25.320]  Need a 35, 37 or 39 waist?
[02:20:25.320 --> 02:20:26.140]  How about a 31 inseam?
[02:20:29.502 --> 02:20:32.504]  We keep all sizes in stock for the fit you need.
[02:20:32.504 --> 02:20:36.766]  Looking for a relaxed fit, slim fit, regular fit, boot cut or straight leg?
[02:20:36.766 --> 02:20:38.327]  We got you covered.

[02:21:00.801 --> 02:21:06.045]  We travel so much and having a fake TV, well, it gives added peace of mind.
[02:21:06.045 --> 02:21:15.472]  Burglars look for houses that appear to be easy targets, but fake TV can fool even professional burglars into thinking someone is home watching television.
[02:21:15.672 --> 02:21:27.951]  As a recent widow living alone, it gives me great peace of mind to set my fake TV near a window and know that passing motorists and pedestrians will think someone is home watching TV when I'm actually away from home.
[02:21:27.951 --> 02:21:30.816]  Fake TV easily plugs into any outlet.
[02:21:31.016 --> 02:21:32.797]  And they're so easy to use.
[02:21:32.797 --> 02:21:34.739]  You just plug them in and they're ready to go.
[02:21:34.739 --> 02:21:38.782]  Plus, they're so affordable that we have one upstairs and downstairs.
[02:21:38.782 --> 02:21:42.324]  Fake TV is only $29.95 with free shipping.
[02:21:42.324 --> 02:21:44.826]  Order your Fake TV by calling 877-532-5388.

[02:21:46.287 --> 02:21:47.228]  Or faketv.com.
[02:21:47.228 --> 02:21:49.029]  Fake TV, the burglar deterrent.
[02:22:00.359 --> 02:22:03.320]  Making the right decisions is a challenge to investors.
[02:22:03.320 --> 02:22:07.462]  Are we going to see economic growth slide into a recession or at worst depression?
[02:22:07.462 --> 02:22:09.743]  Hi, Ted Anderson from Midas Resources.
[02:22:09.743 --> 02:22:14.905]  We all know when a company acts irresponsibly, divesting ourselves in a move towards safety is prudent.
[02:22:14.905 --> 02:22:16.726]  When the market becomes volatile, U.S.
[02:22:16.726 --> 02:22:18.267]  Treasuries are a safe haven.
[02:22:18.267 --> 02:22:19.748]  But what do you do when the U.S.
[02:22:19.748 --> 02:22:22.789]  government overextends itself and spends beyond its means?
[02:22:23.109 --> 02:22:28.493]  Many investors are turning toward gold as a common sense alternative to traditional paper investments.
[02:22:28.493 --> 02:22:37.820]  Midas Resources has put together a powerful book titled 10 Reasons to Own Gold, discussing costs, benefits, risks, featuring full color illustrations, weights, and measures.

[02:22:43.004 --> 02:22:46.466]  Paper investments are dwarfed by gold's 6,000-year history.

[02:22:52.410 --> 02:22:52.570]  Call 800-686-2237.
[02:22:59.654 --> 02:23:04.856]  We all know that Berkey water purification systems are the most trusted name in water filtration.

[02:23:50.352 --> 02:23:50.933]  We're back.
[02:23:50.933 --> 02:23:51.373]  You found it.
[02:23:51.373 --> 02:23:53.195]  The tip of the spear in the fight for human liberty.
[02:24:12.722 --> 02:24:13.542]  Joel Scowls is our guest.
[02:24:13.542 --> 02:24:14.522]  We'll have about 40 after that.
[02:24:14.522 --> 02:24:23.884]  I promise I'll get to the rest of the news I haven't covered yet and some other breaking news and some video clips and audio clips we're going to be playing here.
[02:24:23.884 --> 02:24:31.186]  But going back to Joel Scowls in here, I've got a few questions but I'm going to ask him those after we take some calls.
[02:24:31.186 --> 02:24:36.747]  I'm going to ask him to talk about drones, robots, what that does for the globalists to not have humans in the
[02:24:38.206 --> 02:24:40.048]  Decision-making equation.
[02:24:40.048 --> 02:24:42.350]  Take soldiers out of the way who can refuse illegal orders.
[02:24:42.350 --> 02:24:43.191]  I'm going to ask him about that.
[02:24:43.191 --> 02:24:50.658]  And I'm going to ask him one other question about what are they going to do with us as our credibility rises, as everything we warned about unfolds.
[02:24:50.658 --> 02:24:53.981]  I mean, we're going to be like rock stars, but in a bad way.
[02:24:53.981 --> 02:24:55.863]  Believe me, this isn't fun being right about this.
[02:24:56.303 --> 02:24:57.123]  Yes sir, Alex Jones.
[02:24:57.123 --> 02:24:58.284]  Thank you for having me.
[02:24:58.284 --> 02:25:00.485]  Well, I have a question for Joe, first of all.
[02:25:00.485 --> 02:25:01.745]  Thank you for being alive, my friend.
[02:25:01.745 --> 02:25:03.586]  That was a crazy story you just told.
[02:25:25.969 --> 02:25:34.111]  Um, yeah, I have a question with, well, I say it's both for you and Alex, actually.
[02:25:34.111 --> 02:25:44.174]  With all of the class action suits going on, is it better, A, to go with the class action suits or to sue personal, first of all?
[02:25:44.174 --> 02:25:45.254]  You're talking about suing who?
[02:25:49.597 --> 02:25:51.799]  I'm not getting any of this audio.
[02:25:51.799 --> 02:25:52.420]  Oh, I'm sorry.
[02:25:52.420 --> 02:25:53.781]  We'll send you audio.
[02:25:53.781 --> 02:25:56.264]  Caller, I appreciate your call.
[02:25:56.264 --> 02:25:58.827]  We'll relay that over to you.
[02:26:01.059 --> 02:26:04.963]  He was asking, what about lawsuits against government when they're doing corrupt things?
[02:26:04.963 --> 02:26:06.986]  Are clash action lawsuits good?
[02:26:06.986 --> 02:26:07.927]  Or individual lawsuits?
[02:26:07.927 --> 02:26:16.195]  What's your view on legal maneuvers like suing in New York to block the assault weapons ban or the ammo ban?
[02:26:16.195 --> 02:26:17.477]  That's actually having some success.
[02:26:17.477 --> 02:26:18.057]  What's your view on that?
[02:26:18.057 --> 02:26:19.159]  Only very rarely.
[02:26:19.839 --> 02:26:32.649]  Will the courts respond positively to, and if it's a matter of clear constitutional interpretation, they'll usually even refuse to take the case, or they'll overturn it on appeal.
[02:26:32.649 --> 02:26:33.890]  The courts are very controlled.
[02:26:33.890 --> 02:26:43.477]  Nothing is more telling, for example, than William Griggs' blog Freedom in Our Time, where he documents all of the times that people have taken the cops to court for abuse.
[02:26:44.597 --> 02:26:52.544]  Or for violating their fundamental rights, and only about 1% of the time will judges uphold a victim against the police.
[02:26:52.544 --> 02:26:57.528]  So I have very little confidence that that will work.
[02:26:57.528 --> 02:27:11.059]  Is that why the police on average, a lot of them are actually good men and women I've found, but they've made such a hero psychology out of it that you're an enemy if you don't do whatever the police want, and I mean in some cities the police are downright criminal organizations.
[02:27:12.551 --> 02:27:19.537]  Well, that's absolutely true, Alex, and I think more and more the good people in the police are being pushed out and retired.
[02:27:19.537 --> 02:27:26.162]  That's what this entire mercenary system has been about, hiring mercenaries at ten times the cost of soldiers.
[02:27:26.162 --> 02:27:33.909]  They're vetting, they're seeing who is unprincipled, they're training and hiring people for the dark side of government.
[02:27:33.909 --> 02:27:35.670]  Cadre leaders!
[02:27:35.670 --> 02:27:35.871]  Yes.
[02:27:37.000 --> 02:27:38.121]  It's incredible.
[02:27:38.121 --> 02:27:44.404]  And the stories you told me about family, FBI, CIA, how they try to get them to be corrupt, and they're not corrupt.
[02:27:44.404 --> 02:27:45.625]  You know, they stay at a low level.
[02:27:45.625 --> 02:27:46.665]  It's like this army captain.
[02:27:46.665 --> 02:27:49.207]  People say, well, 20 years in the army, why was he only a captain?
[02:27:49.207 --> 02:27:50.988]  You know, combat veteran, all this stuff.
[02:27:50.988 --> 02:27:52.669]  And now he's speaking out against Obama.
[02:27:52.669 --> 02:27:57.251]  Well, I mean, that's not a sign of being bad that you didn't get promoted.
[02:27:57.251 --> 02:27:58.232]  It's a sign that you're good.
[02:28:00.515 --> 02:28:04.918]  And in fact, anyone who gets to be the highest ranks in the military has to be a yes man.
[02:28:04.918 --> 02:28:15.827]  The one general and one admiral that were relieved for standing down or for refusing to stand down during the Benghazi raid were in fact exceptions to the rule.
[02:28:15.827 --> 02:28:17.528]  Most people would have got along.
[02:28:17.528 --> 02:28:19.149]  They did not go along.
[02:28:19.149 --> 02:28:26.735]  So it shows that even though they've been yes men up to a certain point, sometimes they have a line in the sand they will not cross and have to be removed.
[02:28:26.735 --> 02:28:28.416]  And they had to be silenced as well.
[02:28:28.456 --> 02:28:30.396]  Well sure, Fox Fallon wouldn't attack Iran.
[02:28:30.396 --> 02:28:34.217]  They removed, what, four heads of CENTCOM the last seven, eight years.
[02:28:34.217 --> 02:28:41.319]  And it shows, yeah, they were yes-men to a point, but now what they're being asked to do is so flagrantly criminal that they're not doing it.
[02:28:41.319 --> 02:28:47.301]  In fact, it's now come out Fox Fallon would not launch a fake attack on one of his destroyers with Navy SEALs.
[02:28:47.301 --> 02:28:48.621]  Cy Hirsch brought that out.
[02:28:48.621 --> 02:28:51.742]  Imagine being asked to kill your own people and blame it on somebody.
[02:28:52.622 --> 02:28:53.323]  That's right.
[02:28:53.323 --> 02:28:55.524]  And so that's what they deal with.
[02:28:55.524 --> 02:29:02.450]  And that proves my point that everybody who does the bidding of the globalist isn't necessarily a conspirator.
[02:29:02.450 --> 02:29:03.611]  There's a lot of yesmanship.
[02:29:03.611 --> 02:29:06.674]  There's a lot of predictability they depend upon.
[02:29:06.674 --> 02:29:08.715]  And then there's subtle threats.
[02:29:08.715 --> 02:29:11.217]  There's giving them false reasons.
[02:29:11.217 --> 02:29:13.379]  You know, there's a control system, but it's beneficial.
[02:29:13.379 --> 02:29:14.940]  People need to be controlled.
[02:29:14.940 --> 02:29:18.603]  But at some point, as this gets worse, as you have said today,
[02:29:19.474 --> 02:29:22.863]  We're going to be proven right and they've got to deal with that.
[02:29:22.863 --> 02:29:26.332]  The fact that a lot of people will see conspiracy really does exist.
[02:29:27.335 --> 02:29:28.816]  To take away liberty.
[02:29:28.816 --> 02:29:30.076]  Joel Skousens, our guest.

[02:30:01.442 --> 02:30:04.244]  Supernatural silver is the ultimate tool to prepare you for a medical emergency.
[02:30:31.442 --> 02:30:31.902]  I think so.
[02:31:03.306 --> 02:31:11.412]  If you want an American company with American products made by Americans, here is the Cal Ben Soap Company.

[02:32:03.967 --> 02:32:08.990]  The prognosis for the entire planetary economic system runs from bad to worse.
[02:32:08.990 --> 02:32:16.134]  The globalist model is to shut down societies and starve patriots out until they acquiesce to the global takeover.
[02:32:16.294 --> 02:32:21.919]  That's why we've assembled the most vital and important preparedness items at InfoWarsShop.com.
[02:32:21.919 --> 02:32:25.963]  These are items that I did research on, that I personally use.
[02:32:25.963 --> 02:32:30.687]  You've got the LifeStraw, so you can turn fetid water into safe water anywhere you go.
[02:32:30.687 --> 02:32:35.912]  The KTOR Hand Crank Generator, to charge up key equipment during power outages or out in the field.

[02:32:46.639 --> 02:32:49.541]  Hand-cranked shortwave AM FM radios.
[02:32:49.541 --> 02:32:56.745]  Everything that we've researched and found to be the best is available at Infowarshop.com and your purchase makes our Infowar possible.
[02:32:56.745 --> 02:32:58.006]  We're getting prepared.
[02:32:58.006 --> 02:32:58.667]  Are you?
[02:32:58.667 --> 02:32:59.467]  Infowarshop.com
[02:33:12.233 --> 02:33:18.490]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[02:33:27.623 --> 02:33:32.867]  Alright folks, we are back live as we are every weekday at 11 to 2 Central.
[02:33:32.867 --> 02:33:33.788]  Joel Scalzen is our guest.
[02:33:33.788 --> 02:33:43.396]  I want to take five or six more calls for him and then let him get on about his business while we take calls from people like Mike in Tennessee, listening on WMQM and others.
[02:33:43.396 --> 02:33:47.319]  Joe, AJ, Doris, Brendan, we'll at least get to those five or six calls.
[02:33:47.319 --> 02:33:51.343]  But Joel Scalzen, again if you're just joining us, Alex Jones here back live.
[02:33:51.343 --> 02:33:52.003]  Thank you for joining us.
[02:33:54.165 --> 02:34:06.970]  Looking at this, the mad dash, the holy grail by the establishment in MIT publications, DARPA publications, everywhere, is that the elite are going to have a singularity by 2025.
[02:34:06.970 --> 02:34:11.011]  Now the media always covers this and says that I believe this.
[02:34:11.011 --> 02:34:12.952]  I'm not saying this.
[02:34:12.952 --> 02:34:22.455]  Not just Ray Kurzweil, but the UN, all of them, at the highest levels, they believe that they're going to merge with machines and live forever and become godlike.
[02:34:22.455 --> 02:34:23.276]  Totally delusional.
[02:34:24.504 --> 02:34:30.286]  Some of their forebearers in the eugenics, intermarried, interbred, thinking it would create god men and it created stillborn children.
[02:34:30.286 --> 02:34:36.409]  If you look at the Hugsleys and the Wedgwoods and the Darwins and the Galtons and others, 150 years ago in England.
[02:34:36.409 --> 02:34:44.312]  But they're the progenitors of all this and now today, they say, we're going to have all drones, which will be choosing their own targets.
[02:34:44.312 --> 02:34:47.453]  In fact, the British and the US already have autonomous drones.
[02:34:47.453 --> 02:34:49.274]  We're going to have robots that work on robots.
[02:34:49.434 --> 02:34:52.376]  Foxconn's already rolling out a million of those in China.
[02:34:52.376 --> 02:35:02.141]  They say humans won't matter, and we're going to have, say, a swarm of a thousand little robots that come in your house and basically poison you.
[02:35:02.141 --> 02:35:04.162]  Now, they're moving in that direction.
[02:35:04.162 --> 02:35:14.568]  Undoubtedly, they're moving towards a Skynet system where it's not machines going after humanity, but humans, the technocrats, as they fancy themselves, going after us.
[02:35:14.568 --> 02:35:16.730]  So as a military guy, a military historian,
[02:35:17.290 --> 02:35:18.831]  A researcher who's looked at all this.
[02:35:18.831 --> 02:35:19.952]  I've never heard you speak to it.
[02:35:19.952 --> 02:35:22.034]  I may have missed articles you've written.
[02:35:22.034 --> 02:35:29.080]  What is your take on the globalists and their pipe dreams and their technocracy and where you see all that going, Joel Skousen?
[02:35:31.543 --> 02:35:34.185]  It's hard to say, Alex.
[02:35:34.185 --> 02:35:36.427]  They're always thinking ahead.
[02:35:36.427 --> 02:35:43.211]  We have to remember, as you have said many times, as Dr. Stan Monteith has said, this is a satanic conspiracy at the core.
[02:35:43.211 --> 02:35:50.596]  It's the only thing that explains this generational effect, why this goes on century after century in a seamless manner.
[02:35:50.596 --> 02:35:59.142]  No single evil individual is capable of keeping a conspiracy going for three generations, let alone ten or twelve or longer.
[02:36:00.723 --> 02:36:20.168]  The key to how this operates is this form of immunity, and I've hypothesized that not only does the conspiracy promise immunity on earth against judgment, and that's why they have to control the courts, but it also promises immunity from God's judgment, and that's what this quest for immortality is all about.
[02:36:20.168 --> 02:36:28.651]  You know, it's part of the facade that you can live forever without God, without the resurrection, without the atonement, without Jesus Christ.
[02:36:29.651 --> 02:36:31.695]  And I don't think they'll ever get to that.
[02:36:31.695 --> 02:36:32.718]  I don't think it's possible.
[02:36:32.718 --> 02:36:38.369]  I think it's a violation of the limitations of physics that God places upon the Earth.
[02:36:39.338 --> 02:36:42.320]  I mean, obviously, he doesn't restrict himself to the speed of light.
[02:36:42.320 --> 02:36:46.463]  He can make right angle turns at hyperspeed, but human beings can't.
[02:36:46.463 --> 02:36:55.110]  And I think there's certain limitations about this testing portion of the planet that man, no matter what they're promised by Satan, won't be able to do.
[02:36:55.110 --> 02:36:56.190]  But they will try.
[02:36:56.190 --> 02:36:58.212]  And I know that eugenics is part of that.
[02:36:58.212 --> 02:37:05.878]  They are going to use war and other biological and chemical weapons, vaccines and other things to destroy a lot of people.
[02:37:05.878 --> 02:37:07.038]  But we do have
[02:37:08.012 --> 02:37:08.272]  We're good!
[02:37:23.962 --> 02:37:30.949]  If they're going to get as many of these super weapons or lives that they, I doubt it frankly.
[02:37:30.949 --> 02:37:36.795]  I think that ultimately God's going to thwart that and going to help us to a certain extent to be able to fight.
[02:37:36.795 --> 02:37:37.075]  Sure.
[02:37:37.075 --> 02:37:42.020]  How does the human intellect control super AI computers to begin with?
[02:37:43.361 --> 02:37:50.964]  If they ever even achieve that, I mean, how do they think they're going to be able to even interpret all the data that the machine is engaged in?
[02:37:50.964 --> 02:37:54.565]  And if it isn't, quote, an evil computer, it might be totally logical.
[02:37:54.565 --> 02:37:58.286]  If they ever created AI machines, they would probably wipe out the globalist.
[02:37:59.767 --> 02:38:01.288]  And they might not be able to control them.
[02:38:01.288 --> 02:38:02.229]  That's right.
[02:38:02.229 --> 02:38:16.039]  So I think that they will get, and that's the purpose of the drones, that's the purpose of not only for surveillance, but to be able to target people without the influence of conscience that affects everybody, including
[02:38:16.759 --> 02:38:31.120]  Evil people they are being convicted of what they're doing as they do it and they will be held accountable someday and they want to avoid that accountability they want to avoid that conflict of conscience that occurs that happened in Bosnia with the Air Force pilot of refused
[02:38:32.221 --> 02:38:36.125]  You know, to fire on this civilian convoy that was down there.
[02:38:36.125 --> 02:38:47.914]  It happens even less now with the drones because the guys operating the joysticks at Creech Air Force Base in Nevada don't have the same connection with their targets.
[02:38:47.914 --> 02:38:57.601]  And if you notice, the media talks about how they're such heroes, and they were giving them medals above Purple Hearts, and then Lindsey Graham, the senator, said, we're not the SS.
[02:38:58.402 --> 02:39:02.045]  You know, when we do it, it's good.
[02:39:02.045 --> 02:39:09.873]  But then you hear the whole culture, let's kill those, you know, you know, those Arabs, those, you know, what's those saying in words?
[02:39:09.873 --> 02:39:12.235]  It just really is sick.
[02:39:12.235 --> 02:39:13.616]  And yes, absolutely.
[02:39:13.616 --> 02:39:18.500]  The targeting of civilians is just a terrible thing.
[02:39:18.500 --> 02:39:21.003]  And they're trying to take our humanity away from us.
[02:39:22.952 --> 02:39:30.319]  Which they cannot do and so they're trying to evade the humanity, the influence of conscience that works on people and that's...
[02:39:33.188 --> 02:39:34.129]  That's the issue.
[02:39:34.129 --> 02:39:41.696]  While his Skype is reconnecting there, we've had more problems with Skype than we've ever had, but that's okay because the quality's a little bit better.
[02:39:41.696 --> 02:39:53.446]  For radio listeners, Skype gives you better audio most of the time, but it also gives you video, and that's why we have the TV portion of the transmission at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[02:39:53.446 --> 02:39:55.368]  Joel, as we take a few final calls here,
[02:39:56.821 --> 02:40:08.286]  Uh, we didn't get much into combat in Vietnam, but I mean, uh, I mean, I think you told me about the stress of pilots after long missions coming in at night and bad weather or whatever, having to pry people out of the planes.
[02:40:08.286 --> 02:40:17.550]  Uh, but I mean, did you ever have issues with targets, uh, where, or did you ever see people not, not go after already pre-marked targets if it was clear that civilians were there?
[02:40:19.278 --> 02:40:41.812]  Well, you know, my squadron just came back from Vietnam when I joined it, so I actually did not see combat, but I did talk to many of them about their situation, and yes, they did have problems with targeting, though it's very difficult from a fast-moving fighter jet to be able to determine whether they're civilians or whether or not they're bad guys, you know, scurrying out of the buildings.
[02:40:42.893 --> 02:40:52.968]  But clearly there were a few situations when they rejected targets and actually did not drop on targets that looked like they were mostly women and children.
[02:40:54.082 --> 02:41:00.046]  And that's what's interesting now because the first time they did target men, women, and children was World War II.
[02:41:00.046 --> 02:41:05.310]  Hitler, bad guy obviously, but did not target London because he didn't want to kill men, women, and children.
[02:41:05.310 --> 02:41:14.297]  So the United States and England launched attacks, actually England did it first, to bomb civilian targets to trick Hitler into attacking civilians to unify them.
[02:41:14.297 --> 02:41:18.420]  And then that's how that unrestricted warfare, that's really a war crime, got started.
[02:41:18.420 --> 02:41:19.381]  And I've heard Limbaugh say,
[02:41:19.801 --> 02:41:21.782]  You know, part of war is killing civilians.
[02:41:21.782 --> 02:41:23.362]  We want to create terror.
[02:41:23.362 --> 02:41:24.643]  Of course, he's never been in the military.
[02:41:24.643 --> 02:41:28.204]  He's never studied history, I don't think, or he wouldn't make a statement like that.
[02:41:28.204 --> 02:41:35.206]  But this idea that, hey, it's okay to kill 200 innocent people as long as we get one bad guy, they claim, and call it collateral damage.
[02:41:35.206 --> 02:41:38.787]  Well, that shows you they're not really concerned about dead kids at Sandy Hook.
[02:41:39.227 --> 02:41:42.570]  Or they'd be crying about villages of dead children in Afghanistan.
[02:41:42.570 --> 02:41:49.056]  Plus, even if you're mean, you don't want to kill villages of kids, it turns everybody against you 110%.
[02:41:49.056 --> 02:41:52.439]  If you're trying to occupy some place, you do not want to kill children, do you?
[02:41:53.490 --> 02:41:59.992]  Well that's right and that's why you know historically even the most evil criminals have never gone into kindergartens and killed people.
[02:41:59.992 --> 02:42:15.437]  Only people that are mind-controlled or hypnotized or in some way drugged up or in combination of all those three are capable of doing the crimes of Sandy Hook and that's why I'm absolutely convinced that was a government crime putting people up to it.
[02:42:15.837 --> 02:42:22.129]  Oh wow, I really respect your view and I read your site all the time and have you on, but I've just been so busy I hadn't looked into your view.
[02:42:22.129 --> 02:42:24.794]  All I know is this, Aurora, and remember they did...
[02:42:25.765 --> 02:42:30.948]  Fast and Furious, which is a false flag, they're capable of anything, as Larry Pratt has said, head of Gunners of America.
[02:42:30.948 --> 02:42:33.209]  But you look at Aurora, there's no doubt.
[02:42:33.209 --> 02:42:39.152]  He's in a DARPA program, thirty-something thousand a year, high-level Air Force psychiatrist attached to him.
[02:42:39.152 --> 02:42:44.154]  The DARPA program is in a mind-brain interface with computers.
[02:42:44.154 --> 02:42:45.314]  It's a mind control area.
[02:42:45.314 --> 02:42:47.716]  He's on seven drugs.
[02:42:47.716 --> 02:42:49.817]  He says, I'm under mind control at the jail.
[02:42:49.817 --> 02:42:54.119]  Then they cover that up and now they're going to drug him with truth serum.
[02:42:54.719 --> 02:43:00.647]  Which, if you're under mind control, for those that don't know, they use that in mind control to, quote, make him tell the truth at trial.
[02:43:00.647 --> 02:43:01.648]  I mean, this is amazing.
[02:43:01.648 --> 02:43:04.412]  And then you look at Sandy Hook, it's got all the same signs.
[02:43:04.412 --> 02:43:05.514]  Joel, give us your take on that.
[02:43:06.991 --> 02:43:16.354]  Well, I knew something was up when Holmes, as soon as he was taken into custody, the one thing the police let through was his psychiatrist to give him his meds.
[02:43:16.354 --> 02:43:21.836]  And that means that they realized he was starting to talk out of school once those meds had worn off.
[02:43:21.836 --> 02:43:28.118]  He admitted that he was drugged, and they had to get him drugged back up again, and he looked like a zombie when he appeared at his first hearings.
[02:43:28.118 --> 02:43:33.440]  And now they've got to drug him again, because I've seen some of those drawings of him when he's not drugged, he looks normal.
[02:43:33.440 --> 02:43:35.501]  They could grab any of us, drug us,
[02:43:36.281 --> 02:43:37.062]  We're amnesic?
[02:43:37.062 --> 02:43:38.063]  We don't remember anything?
[02:43:38.063 --> 02:43:39.364]  And they just blame us?
[02:43:39.364 --> 02:43:40.905]  This is the oldest trick in the book!
[02:43:40.905 --> 02:43:45.209]  And, man, that really shows you how nasty the Obama people are.
[02:43:45.209 --> 02:43:46.370]  Why are they so confident?
[02:43:46.370 --> 02:43:48.932]  Because I agree it's blowing up in their face, but they're moving forward, Joel.
[02:43:50.267 --> 02:43:52.408]  Well, they are, and we're going to see more Sandy Hooks.
[02:43:52.408 --> 02:43:55.149]  I don't think this gun control agenda is going to pass.
[02:43:55.149 --> 02:44:08.013]  I think they're going to get, you know, at best, they're going to get the enhanced background checks, which means basically there's no more private sales, and they'll start to build a list, but they still won't get a list.
[02:44:08.013 --> 02:44:10.613]  They're going to need to do the grandfather thing.
[02:44:10.613 --> 02:44:14.615]  That's a very powerful and evil agenda, when they ban assault weapons and they say,
[02:44:15.755 --> 02:44:20.737]  I think someday they're going to say, you can have any weapon but you're going to have to register it.
[02:44:20.737 --> 02:44:25.558]  They're going to need that in order to get a confiscatory list that they will use.
[02:44:25.558 --> 02:44:26.438]  Absolutely.
[02:44:26.438 --> 02:44:31.260]  Man, I tell you though, I don't just get up here and say I believe something's staged if it isn't.
[02:44:32.140 --> 02:44:33.320]  They keep doing it in Colorado.
[02:44:33.320 --> 02:44:35.021]  This was close to Littleton.
[02:44:35.021 --> 02:44:36.721]  Littleton.
[02:44:36.721 --> 02:44:39.262]  The whole thing with Harrison Kleibold.
[02:44:39.262 --> 02:44:42.502]  Totally staged if you look at the real news of that.
[02:44:42.502 --> 02:44:45.303]  127 bombs in the building.
[02:44:45.303 --> 02:44:47.003]  Half the school empty.
[02:44:47.003 --> 02:44:48.403]  They did training videos.
[02:44:48.403 --> 02:44:51.244]  Part of the school of a mass shooting.
[02:44:51.244 --> 02:44:52.704]  DARPA connections to that.
[02:44:52.704 --> 02:44:54.705]  I mean, you look at all these things.
[02:44:54.705 --> 02:44:55.745]  It is amazing.
[02:44:56.365 --> 02:45:07.251]  They had a mass shooting outside Fort Worth, I don't know, like 14 years ago, and it was in the local news that neighbors saw the Navy veteran being drug out, being drug out to his van.
[02:45:09.175 --> 02:45:12.017]  Out to a white van and driven away a week before he went and shot everybody.
[02:45:12.017 --> 02:45:17.921]  I mean, it's just like with the Aurora, Colorado shooting.
[02:45:17.921 --> 02:45:23.365]  I mean, it is the most cut and dry mind control where they're just doing it out in the open.
[02:45:23.365 --> 02:45:25.006]  I mean, in a DARPA program.
[02:45:25.006 --> 02:45:27.848]  Theodore Kaczynski was in the CIA MKUltra program.
[02:45:27.848 --> 02:45:29.249]  That's LA Times.
[02:45:29.249 --> 02:45:31.110]  That's Associated Press.
[02:45:31.110 --> 02:45:32.231]  I showed you that last Friday.
[02:45:32.231 --> 02:45:33.832]  I showed people the articles.
[02:45:33.832 --> 02:45:37.214]  I mean, this is so insane.
[02:45:38.447 --> 02:45:44.832]  All right, we're going to go ahead now and take some phone calls here.
[02:45:44.832 --> 02:45:48.515]  Joe in Pennsylvania, you're on the air.
[02:45:48.515 --> 02:45:50.196]  Joe in Pennsylvania, you're on the air.
[02:45:50.196 --> 02:45:52.618]  Go ahead and ask your question while we're getting Joel back.
[02:45:52.618 --> 02:45:53.979]  Okay.
[02:45:53.979 --> 02:45:57.202]  Yeah, first of all, I want to thank you guys for everything you're doing.
[02:45:57.202 --> 02:46:02.066]  I'm a longtime listener and I support all you guys, but I have a question.
[02:46:03.789 --> 02:46:05.049]  There's a lot of talk going on.
[02:46:05.049 --> 02:46:11.771]  I've been listening for years about all these things that are happening and it's happening faster and faster and we're losing more and more.
[02:46:11.771 --> 02:46:18.733]  My question is to the leaders that are in this movement such as yourself and Joel and all the others that are out there.
[02:46:18.733 --> 02:46:26.416]  When it comes time, have you ever thought about what's going to happen when the proverbial crap hits the fan?
[02:46:26.416 --> 02:46:30.517]  Have you ever considered taking like your own resources
[02:46:31.497 --> 02:46:35.142]  To save as many poor people as you can from the things that are going to happen.
[02:46:35.142 --> 02:46:41.870]  What I've found is if you try to just quote share everything you've got up front then it just gets dissipated.
[02:46:41.870 --> 02:46:45.174]  Poor people don't know how to take care of themselves then you're poor.
[02:46:45.174 --> 02:46:49.319]  You have to build systems to try to empower as many people as you can.
[02:46:50.420 --> 02:46:55.002]  And then see, I just don't see all this as a foregone conclusion.
[02:46:55.002 --> 02:46:59.823]  And I am trying to get my family and people I know around me ready.
[02:46:59.823 --> 02:47:07.486]  I'm trying to get everybody out there ready with some basics before things degrade so that those of us that are awake and aware have a better chance.
[02:47:07.486 --> 02:47:07.706]  Joel?
[02:47:09.113 --> 02:47:20.875]  You know, I think so many people have tried to fashion, let's just assume the worst case scenario, we do suffer nuclear war, they do put us into a new world order in reaction to that.
[02:47:20.875 --> 02:47:24.996]  There's no way you can prepare and gather people in advance.
[02:47:24.996 --> 02:47:34.678]  People have jobs, people have varying financial circumstances, and even if you were able to get together, knit together a very big group, you'd get infiltrated, there'd be infighting.
[02:47:34.678 --> 02:47:36.899]  What I think is going to happen is that
[02:47:37.779 --> 02:47:43.063]  If we, like you're doing now and what I'm doing Alex, trying to get people to prepare for both scenarios.
[02:47:43.063 --> 02:47:48.466]  If we win, that's fine, but we at the same time we have to prepare for a takedown.
[02:47:48.466 --> 02:47:51.328]  We have to prepare for a loss in advance.
[02:47:51.328 --> 02:47:53.330]  Prepare an orderly retreat.
[02:47:53.330 --> 02:48:00.795]  If people have prepared so that they can survive this nuclear war, I think we're going to have to rely upon the individual inspiration of God
[02:48:01.747 --> 02:48:03.808]  As people are driven out, you know.
[02:48:03.808 --> 02:48:06.188]  Right now we're all spread out around the world.
[02:48:06.188 --> 02:48:11.690]  I think God is going to drive people out of the big cities when no longer have jobs to keep them there.
[02:48:11.690 --> 02:48:14.130]  God's going to make us get self-sufficient.
[02:48:14.130 --> 02:48:18.091]  They're going to feel the inspiration to go to places where it's safer.
[02:48:18.091 --> 02:48:22.913]  And they're going to congregate to places which have a reputation for being safer.
[02:48:22.913 --> 02:48:27.874]  And then we'll have a majority of people in those areas that will be able to contend with the new world order.
[02:48:28.735 --> 02:48:30.256]  Exactly.
[02:48:30.256 --> 02:48:31.378]  Here's an example to the caller.
[02:48:31.378 --> 02:48:42.390]  If I randomly went and got 10 poor people, brought them to my house, and said I'm going to divide everything I've got up amongst you, they would start fighting with each other, and I'm telling you, the way this works, someone would probably end up killing me.
[02:48:43.351 --> 02:48:46.334]  I mean, that's the thing about redistribution.
[02:48:46.334 --> 02:48:52.239]  You've got to teach people how to catch fish, not feed them fish.
[02:48:52.239 --> 02:48:54.181]  That's really the message I'm giving people.
[02:48:54.181 --> 02:48:57.945]  That's why the globalists want you dependent and want you to not know how to do anything.
[02:48:57.945 --> 02:49:01.988]  That's why they teach kids 2 plus 2 doesn't necessarily equal 4.
[02:49:01.988 --> 02:49:03.089]  See, that's not a joke now.
[02:49:03.089 --> 02:49:07.834]  They're teaching kids how to be basket cases as part of the takeover, Joel.
[02:49:10.157 --> 02:49:17.402]  And as I say, you know, that's why I don't even recommend that people try to join survival groups like the Citadel forming a walled city.
[02:49:17.402 --> 02:49:19.364]  It just makes you a target.
[02:49:19.364 --> 02:49:22.446]  I think it is sufficient for people to prepare as best they can.
[02:49:22.446 --> 02:49:25.428]  And if they can't afford a retreat, they prepare where they are.
[02:49:25.428 --> 02:49:28.851]  They get to a fairly safe place in the outskirts of cities.
[02:49:28.851 --> 02:49:31.753]  They prepare to leave when times get bad.
[02:49:31.753 --> 02:49:34.475]  And then I think we can knit together a society.
[02:49:34.475 --> 02:49:38.998]  And I believe in informal networks of people of support networks.
[02:49:39.318 --> 02:49:46.579]  Not that you have to meet every week, or make yourself a target, but informal, list the people in your own mind that you know you can trust.
[02:49:46.579 --> 02:49:47.240]  That's right.
[02:49:47.240 --> 02:49:47.560]  Exactly.
[02:49:47.560 --> 02:49:49.460]  People always say, trust me, trust me, trust me.
[02:49:49.460 --> 02:49:51.400]  You can only trust somebody you really know.
[02:49:51.400 --> 02:49:57.522]  I always say, don't trust me, know me, and then you will have trust.
[02:49:57.522 --> 02:49:58.762]  Go ahead, Joel.
[02:49:58.762 --> 02:50:03.543]  Well... I mean, do you agree with that statement I just made?
[02:50:07.509 --> 02:50:09.190]  Yeah, his Skype went down again.
[02:50:09.190 --> 02:50:12.251]  It's been really rocky here, but we've had him longer.
[02:50:12.251 --> 02:50:16.653]  It's been a great interview so far.
[02:50:16.653 --> 02:50:19.014]  Joe, does that answer your question?
[02:50:19.014 --> 02:50:20.455]  Yeah, in a way it does.
[02:50:20.455 --> 02:50:28.738]  I just feel really bad because there's so many people that are poor and that want to do things and they're not going to know where to go and they're going to be looking for leadership.
[02:50:28.738 --> 02:50:34.361]  I just would hate to think that their options are to just walk themselves into those camps
[02:50:34.781 --> 02:50:40.043]  Oh no, they're going to join the FEMA Brigade and then they give them a machine gun to take out the terrorists.
[02:50:40.043 --> 02:50:40.984]  I mean, it's going to be fun.
[02:50:40.984 --> 02:50:43.545]  I wouldn't even feel bad for the average poor people.
[02:50:43.545 --> 02:50:52.508]  They're going to be used as the new soldier force, you know, those that can't take care of themselves against whoever was self-sufficient and bring us back to the camps and make us work for them.
[02:50:52.508 --> 02:50:57.050]  That's actually going to be poor people in black uniforms aiming machine guns at us.
[02:50:57.050 --> 02:50:58.711]  We're going to be in the fields working for them.
[02:50:59.577 --> 02:51:00.638]  Okay, we'll be right back.
[02:51:00.638 --> 02:51:01.939]  Stay with us.

[02:51:11.769 --> 02:51:13.911]  Now is the time to get prepared.

[02:53:49.421 --> 02:53:49.881]  That's 866-369-3678.
[02:53:49.881 --> 02:53:50.961]  Pro-EM1, the raw probiotic.
[02:54:12.105 --> 02:54:14.407]  Alright ladies and gentlemen, here's the bottom line.
[02:54:14.407 --> 02:54:17.770]  Usurpers and dominators always want to disarm people.
[02:54:17.770 --> 02:54:21.954]  The British government was turning the colonists into basically sharecropping slaves.
[02:54:21.954 --> 02:54:23.035]  They came to take the guns.
[02:54:23.035 --> 02:54:23.596]  Santa Ana?
[02:54:24.789 --> 02:54:28.070]  Mexico had invited people in because they couldn't hold the area.
[02:54:28.070 --> 02:54:29.670]  They came in, they built farms.
[02:54:29.670 --> 02:54:32.010]  Santa Ana was coming to take property, guns, everything.
[02:54:32.010 --> 02:54:33.151]  People fought back.
[02:54:33.151 --> 02:54:40.212]  Mayor Bloomberg, McCain, all these police chiefs that work with them, they are Santa Ana, they are King George III, they are tyrants.
[02:54:40.212 --> 02:54:42.512]  And they're going, oh, we want to be reasonable, we want to be nice.
[02:54:42.512 --> 02:54:44.673]  Well, they armed the teeth against us.
[02:54:44.673 --> 02:54:48.433]  The article is up on PrisonPlanet.com and Infowars.com.
[02:54:48.433 --> 02:54:52.534]  McCain gets behind a sneak attack on Second Amendment to ban private sales.
[02:54:53.487 --> 02:54:55.330]  to ban high-capacity mags.
[02:54:55.330 --> 02:54:59.296]  This is a way to hunt us and make us the new prison fodder to fill the prisons.
[02:54:59.296 --> 02:55:02.621]  Final segment with Joel Skousen of WorldAffairsBrief.com.
[02:55:02.621 --> 02:55:04.244]  Doris in Tennessee, thanks for holding.
[02:55:04.244 --> 02:55:05.906]  Real quick question for Joel.
[02:55:05.906 --> 02:55:06.247]  Go ahead.
[02:55:09.403 --> 02:55:30.938]  Hello, I really agree with everything that you say, and what my main concern is right now is the corruption of this government, and now we're being indoctrinated with, you know, I love Rosa Corey, but I don't want to see these commercials on TV for same-sex marriage.
[02:55:30.938 --> 02:55:33.100]  Fox News is running them constantly.
[02:55:34.619 --> 02:55:35.399]  Well, no, sure, sure.
[02:55:35.399 --> 02:55:36.360]  I mean, let's expand on this.
[02:55:36.360 --> 02:55:39.302]  It's not that we dislike people for whatever they're doing.
[02:55:39.302 --> 02:55:43.644]  I mean, we're all, you know, doing things that, you know, in God's system, God sees as bad.
[02:55:43.644 --> 02:55:45.766]  It's the issue is they're forcing it on kids.
[02:55:45.766 --> 02:55:53.970]  They are trying to end the family, and they're trying to sexualize children everywhere, and it is very evil.
[02:55:53.970 --> 02:55:55.992]  So I guess that's a question for Joel Skousen.
[02:55:55.992 --> 02:55:59.093]  I mean, that is part of the plan, is to destroy the family.
[02:55:59.093 --> 02:55:59.634]  Joel Skousen.
[02:56:00.623 --> 02:56:08.467]  It is, and they're using the doctrine of rights to say, you know, this is just not right, that we cannot exercise the right to be married.
[02:56:08.467 --> 02:56:12.489]  But it is a misunderstanding of the doctrine of rights.
[02:56:12.489 --> 02:56:17.752]  They have the perfect right to go ahead in private and have whatever relationships they want.
[02:56:17.752 --> 02:56:21.934]  They don't have the right to force other people to accept that, however.
[02:56:22.694 --> 02:56:24.937]  And that's what we lost in the civil rights movement.
[02:56:24.937 --> 02:56:27.721]  We lost the right of private discrimination.
[02:56:27.721 --> 02:56:29.144]  And it's a fundamental right.
[02:56:29.144 --> 02:56:35.733]  If you don't have the right to disassociate, then you've really lost a major fundamental right that can force that upon you.
[02:56:35.733 --> 02:56:36.474]  Well, here's the deal.
[02:56:36.474 --> 02:56:38.717]  All of these groups that are saying they're being persecuted...
[02:56:39.578 --> 02:56:49.206]  Uh, have diverse people in them, but the ones the globalists are controlling are wanting to force us to accept everything they're pushing, including euthanasia.
[02:56:49.206 --> 02:56:52.789]  I mean, it's the whole agenda is just anti-life.
[02:56:52.789 --> 02:57:06.580]  I mean, the globalists, I have the university documents, I cover it in Endgame 2.0, the extra, that's on PrisonPlanet.tv, where we read the stuff where they said, we're going to promote homosexuality so that we can reduce population in the family.
[02:57:07.040 --> 02:57:08.101]  I mean, you know what?
[02:57:08.101 --> 02:57:13.786]  And then I've had people in Whole Foods demonize my three kids and tell me I shouldn't have three kids.
[02:57:13.786 --> 02:57:16.689]  They're discriminating against me!
[02:57:16.689 --> 02:57:17.269]  I'm sorry, Joel.
[02:57:17.269 --> 02:57:17.550]  Go ahead.
[02:57:18.936 --> 02:57:28.905]  Well, there is a war against the family, and it's on a lot of sides, whether it's birth control, whether it's abortion, whether it's the discouragement of families.
[02:57:28.905 --> 02:57:39.595]  But I believe, you know, and we're losing the battle of eugenics, basically, because other more socialist economies are outproducing us.
[02:57:39.595 --> 02:57:45.240]  The American white Christian family is not producing as many children as they should.
[02:57:45.820 --> 02:57:47.642]  And we should be having more children.
[02:57:47.642 --> 02:57:50.565]  We should be keeping them out of the public schools.
[02:57:50.565 --> 02:57:57.491]  We've got to start more homeschooling or using private schools to raise up a generation that can withstand what's coming.
[02:57:57.491 --> 02:58:03.336]  Well, look at the new Southern Poverty Law Center report that actually says being white is inherently bad.
[02:58:03.336 --> 02:58:08.421]  I mean, man, it's almost meant to make whites become racial.
[02:58:08.421 --> 02:58:11.444]  I mean, it's like so openly saying white men are bad, period.
[02:58:13.237 --> 02:58:23.321]  Well, we're certainly leading the point we're going to be a minority someday, and you watch, we won't have the same minority rights they're pushing for Latinos and other minority groups right now.
[02:58:23.321 --> 02:58:26.042]  Well sure, the globalists just use it as a divide-and-conquer strategy.
[02:58:26.042 --> 02:58:29.423]  Joel Skalzin, worldaffairsbrief.com.
[02:58:29.423 --> 02:58:34.025]  I want to get you back soon on the whole Russian thing and so many fronts.
[02:58:34.025 --> 02:58:35.385]  Thank you for joining us.

[02:59:52.116 --> 02:59:55.721]  Coast to Coast, direct from Austin.
[02:59:55.721 --> 02:59:58.925]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network.
[03:00:05.939 --> 03:00:10.763]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[03:00:10.763 --> 03:00:12.365]  You want answers?
[03:00:12.365 --> 03:00:13.906]  Well, so does he.
[03:00:13.906 --> 03:00:18.090]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[03:00:18.090 --> 03:00:22.154]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[03:00:32.245 --> 03:00:36.288]  All right, I'm doing overdrive for, I don't know, 20-30 minutes here before we get to rebroadcast.
[03:00:36.288 --> 03:00:40.131]  Might as well just go back to four hours every day.
[03:00:40.131 --> 03:00:42.893]  Amazing that I'm so out of control.
[03:00:42.893 --> 03:00:49.457]  I've got all these special reports I've got to shoot tonight and a bunch of other stuff we're doing with working on hiring more reporters.
[03:00:49.457 --> 03:00:51.299]  And it's all because you've been supporting us out there.
[03:00:51.299 --> 03:00:51.859]  I salute you.
[03:00:51.859 --> 03:00:53.440]  I want to thank you.
[03:00:53.440 --> 03:00:55.281]  You've also got DrudgeReport.com.
[03:00:55.281 --> 03:01:00.085]  We want to just thank Drudge for helping push the bullet story out to be one of the big stories out there.
[03:01:00.085 --> 03:01:00.605]  They're buying 300 and
[03:01:01.926 --> 03:01:04.309]  Sixty million more bullets on top of that.
[03:01:04.309 --> 03:01:06.211]  We're going to be breaking that down.
[03:01:06.211 --> 03:01:12.058]  But Mike in Tennessee, a WMQM 1600 AM listener, you're on the air.
[03:01:12.058 --> 03:01:12.459]  Go ahead.
[03:01:12.459 --> 03:01:14.021]  Good afternoon.
[03:01:14.021 --> 03:01:14.902]  Two quick questions.
[03:01:14.902 --> 03:01:19.768]  First of all, how soon before someone walks into a bank and says, this is a haircut, give me all the money?
[03:01:20.697 --> 03:01:30.221]  Well, actually, I've seen the editorial cartoons where you go up to the bank window and they aim a gun at you and say, but no, that's not a stick-up when the bank just says 40% of your money's gone.
[03:01:30.221 --> 03:01:32.401]  That's liberal and loving and good.
[03:01:32.401 --> 03:01:34.002]  And if you don't like it, you're an extremist.
[03:01:34.002 --> 03:01:40.104]  Because the Southern Poverty Law Center and ADL say the Federal Reserve is federal, even though it's admittedly private.
[03:01:40.104 --> 03:01:42.625]  And I can play Greenspan saying that.
[03:01:42.625 --> 03:01:43.366]  It isn't.
[03:01:43.366 --> 03:01:44.346]  Are you a terrorist, sir?
[03:01:44.346 --> 03:01:47.467]  Because knowing how to walk and chew gum is terrorism.
[03:01:47.467 --> 03:01:48.788]  Knowing how to tie your shoelaces.
[03:01:49.528 --> 03:01:53.490]  Quite frankly, if you don't know how to wipe your hind end, sir, you're a terrorist.
[03:01:53.490 --> 03:01:54.330]  Did you figure that out?
[03:01:54.330 --> 03:01:58.271]  The public schools now teach 2 plus 2 equals 5, okay?
[03:01:58.271 --> 03:01:59.452]  I mean, literally.
[03:01:59.452 --> 03:02:01.713]  They now teach that, I mean, you're evil.
[03:02:01.713 --> 03:02:03.553]  Are you saying 2 plus 2 equals 4?
[03:02:03.553 --> 03:02:05.914]  Because that's racist.
[03:02:05.914 --> 03:02:07.575]  Is Joel still on the line, or is he hot?
[03:02:07.575 --> 03:02:08.275]  No, no, he had to go.
[03:02:08.275 --> 03:02:08.715]  He had to go.
[03:02:08.715 --> 03:02:09.416]  Go ahead.
[03:02:09.416 --> 03:02:17.499]  If you can share this with him, ask him, was this Glasser RGA Chuck Cooper-built plane, and was his tail number, did it start with CG?
[03:02:19.190 --> 03:02:20.651]  And if it did, you need to get back with me.
[03:02:20.651 --> 03:02:24.432]  I probably can help him figure out what happened to it.
[03:02:24.432 --> 03:02:26.413]  Guys, pull up that video of his plane.
[03:02:26.413 --> 03:02:28.434]  See if the tail number has CG in it.
[03:02:28.434 --> 03:02:30.835]  It would start off with CG.
[03:02:30.835 --> 03:02:33.616]  I've got a relative who's a manufacturer of those planes.
[03:02:33.616 --> 03:02:35.457]  They didn't make a lot of them.
[03:02:35.457 --> 03:02:44.560]  And if he's got one, I bet you his fuel filler cap dent was clogged.
[03:02:44.560 --> 03:02:47.942]  Well, it's amazing he didn't get hurt worse.
[03:02:50.083 --> 03:02:51.264]  Very quick aircraft.
[03:02:51.264 --> 03:02:56.389]  Everything happens very quickly with that plane and they're very critical.
[03:02:56.389 --> 03:03:01.875]  Little things make big changes real quickly and he is very fortunate.
[03:03:01.875 --> 03:03:02.816]  He certainly is.
[03:03:02.816 --> 03:03:05.338]  You think he was smart to take the plane in fast?
[03:03:05.338 --> 03:03:06.920]  Yes, definitely.
[03:03:06.920 --> 03:03:07.721]  Yes.
[03:03:07.721 --> 03:03:11.905]  You know, hit the ground and slide on your butt is probably the safest thing he could have done.
[03:03:13.737 --> 03:03:14.218]  Wow.
[03:03:14.218 --> 03:03:19.323]  Well, listen, I really appreciate you coming on with us as a caller.
[03:03:19.323 --> 03:03:20.384]  Good to hear from you.
[03:03:20.384 --> 03:03:21.966]  Let's talk to Scott in Arizona.
[03:03:21.966 --> 03:03:22.867]  Scott, you're on the air.
[03:03:22.867 --> 03:03:27.291]  Go ahead.
[03:03:27.291 --> 03:03:28.312]  All right.
[03:03:28.312 --> 03:03:29.574]  Scott, you want to go on air?
[03:03:29.574 --> 03:03:30.074]  Are you there?
[03:03:30.074 --> 03:03:31.536]  All right.
[03:03:31.536 --> 03:03:33.278]  We're going to go to break here in a few minutes.
[03:03:33.278 --> 03:03:35.019]  We're going to come back with Jake in Texas.
[03:03:38.151 --> 03:03:42.775]  Who's an XM 166 listener and we're going to go to Jock in California.
[03:03:42.775 --> 03:03:52.942]  That'll be it for calls that I have time for here today because I want to hit on some other news items that I have not even gotten to yet.
[03:03:52.942 --> 03:04:03.951]  But I was just speaking about, again, you're brought up, you know, my parents, fiscally conservative, but when it came to like race issues and things, you know, liberal.
[03:04:04.895 --> 03:04:07.117]  This is, you know, kumbaya, Christian stuff.
[03:04:07.117 --> 03:04:13.642]  And again, the globalists want divide and conquer, but then you have Michael Moore coming out saying 90% of guns are owned by scared white people.
[03:04:13.642 --> 03:04:15.603]  We're going to play that clip when we come back.
[03:04:15.603 --> 03:04:17.825]  That just shows, of course, that's not true.
[03:04:17.825 --> 03:04:19.326]  90% of guns are not owned by white people.
[03:04:19.326 --> 03:04:29.393]  I actually went and looked up the best statistics they think, and something around 60% of guns are owned by white people, because 60% of people above about the age of 30 or so are white.
[03:04:30.254 --> 03:04:34.517]  So it's pure lies, but now see it's a racial issue.
[03:04:34.517 --> 03:04:38.199]  Turn your guns in or evil whitey, evil whitey.
[03:04:38.199 --> 03:04:39.920]  Gun owners are racist.
[03:04:39.920 --> 03:04:42.222]  The NRA is racist.
[03:04:42.222 --> 03:04:50.107]  When the NRA was a Republican group founded after the Civil War to train Northerners how to shoot better because they weren't growing up around guns.
[03:04:50.107 --> 03:04:51.008]  Most of them were immigrants.
[03:04:55.635 --> 03:05:02.940]  Hello, I'm Alex Jones.

[03:05:41.705 --> 03:05:51.613]  You are the response to the globalist technocrats and their program of global eugenics dehumanization and ultimate extermination.
[03:05:51.613 --> 03:05:53.114]  The war is here.
[03:05:53.114 --> 03:05:55.016]  It's an info war.
[03:05:55.016 --> 03:05:57.718]  The spirit of 1776 versus the mindset of 1984.

[03:08:04.523 --> 03:08:07.308]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[03:08:09.082 --> 03:08:17.548]  Okay, this is breaking news, breaking news up at InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com by Steve Watson.
[03:08:17.548 --> 03:08:21.530]  Video, hundreds of DHS armored trucks on the move.
[03:08:21.530 --> 03:08:26.294]  More footage of military vehicles being delivered, services online.
[03:08:26.294 --> 03:08:30.016]  They've admittedly bought 2,700 more this year.
[03:08:30.016 --> 03:08:38.642]  And we have videos of DHS, HSI, Homeland Security with the armored vehicles patrolling in America.
[03:08:39.602 --> 03:08:56.549]  With the armored vehicles patrolling in America, which they admit they're patrolling in America, but when we talk about it they say they don't exist and then point out that some of the same vehicles are delivered to the Marines and the Army for overseas use to kind of confuse everybody.
[03:08:57.622 --> 03:09:07.146]  You see, and they'll do that as long as they can, just to make it a debate about does it exist, instead of having the debate about why are you militarizing police that's no secret.
[03:09:07.146 --> 03:09:09.987]  There's no secret police departments in your town.
[03:09:09.987 --> 03:09:17.950]  I mean, everybody's seen it in a local paper, where they get the different armored vehicles, some of them six-wheel, some of them four-wheel, but they're getting these really heavy ones now.
[03:09:18.750 --> 03:09:21.091]  They're being deployed and I've talked to military.
[03:09:21.091 --> 03:09:22.712]  I've been sent video.
[03:09:22.712 --> 03:09:28.555]  They've got regular tanks cached at many armories so we can
[03:09:29.943 --> 03:09:33.707]  Punch this up here on screen for TV viewers and not radio listeners.
[03:09:33.707 --> 03:09:49.686]  Just go to Infowars.com and you can see a link to some of the YouTube videos that show these heavy armored trucks and it breaks down where the MRAP trucks are
[03:09:50.627 --> 03:10:18.385]  are going to there's also Bradley fighting vehicles painted up from the camo desert camo to the camo for here in the United States and they've got all sorts of bulldozers and just you know you name it with them super creepville and also if you go to DrudgeReport.com you can see the big story about three hundred and
[03:10:22.057 --> 03:10:25.780]  Sixty million more bullets.
[03:10:25.780 --> 03:10:33.766]  Three hundred and sixty million more bullets.
[03:10:33.766 --> 03:10:34.967]  Here's another headline.
[03:10:34.967 --> 03:10:37.729]  Southern California seeks drone zone.
[03:10:37.729 --> 03:10:41.472]  And again, they'll just condition you that it's for the border, which they leave wide open.
[03:10:41.472 --> 03:10:43.854]  And then over time, deploy it everywhere.
[03:10:43.854 --> 03:10:44.455]  Then right there,
[03:10:47.379 --> 03:10:51.224]  50 point swing on targeted drone killings of U.S.
[03:10:51.224 --> 03:10:56.670]  citizens.
[03:10:56.670 --> 03:10:58.371]  Let's see what that article is about up at Drudge.
[03:10:58.371 --> 03:10:59.733]  I haven't even seen this yet.
[03:10:59.733 --> 03:11:00.434]  This just broke.
[03:11:01.684 --> 03:11:02.665]  And that's out of slate.
[03:11:02.665 --> 03:11:06.467]  50-point swing against targeted drone killings of U.S.
[03:11:06.467 --> 03:11:07.047]  citizens.
[03:11:07.047 --> 03:11:18.013]  A year ago, as the presidential race was taking shape, the Washington Post pollster asked voters whether they favored the use of drones to kill terrorists or terrorist suspects if they were American citizens living in other countries.
[03:11:18.013 --> 03:11:23.917]  The net rating at the time was a positive 65% for 26% firmly against.
[03:11:23.917 --> 03:11:30.841]  Today, after a month of Rand Paul-driven discussion, how about DrugsReport.com driven and Infowars.com driven?
[03:11:31.767 --> 03:11:40.638]  I'm not giving, I'm not taking credit away from Rand Paul, it's just, you know, we've been the ones pointing this out in the wilderness, and I'm just showing the power of our listeners.
[03:11:40.638 --> 03:11:44.343]  And Andrade's report, of course, has driven it way over the top.
[03:11:44.343 --> 03:11:50.371]  Today, after a month of Rand Paul-driven discussion on drone warfare, Gallup Poll asked the same question.
[03:11:52.443 --> 03:11:53.064]  Should U.S.
[03:11:53.064 --> 03:11:55.748]  drones be used to launch airstrikes on other countries against U.S.
[03:11:55.748 --> 03:11:58.031]  citizens living abroad who are suspected terrorists?
[03:11:58.031 --> 03:11:59.413]  Suspected, you notice.
[03:11:59.413 --> 03:12:03.178]  New numbers, 41 percent for, 52 percent against.
[03:12:03.178 --> 03:12:05.361]  There's been a massive, basically a swing the other direction.
[03:12:06.809 --> 03:12:14.453]  So, uh, and of course Gallup is always whitewashing things and I'm sure it's way more serious than that.
[03:12:14.453 --> 03:12:19.376]  Most people I know understand drones are very, very serious because they also get their robotic.
[03:12:19.376 --> 03:12:22.318]  There's something even colder about the fact that it's a robot.
[03:12:23.318 --> 03:12:24.959]  And more and more they are autonomous.
[03:12:24.959 --> 03:12:35.423]  And then again, DHS to buy 360 million more rounds of hollow point ammunition and then they say it's for target practice when you don't use hollow points in target practicing.
[03:12:35.423 --> 03:12:36.423]  Period.
[03:12:36.423 --> 03:12:37.243]  End of story.
[03:12:37.243 --> 03:12:41.405]  They cost up to four times as more as full metal jacket.
[03:12:41.405 --> 03:12:50.548]  And now they're buying over a hundred different types of weird ammo that no feds use and the military doesn't use.
[03:12:50.548 --> 03:12:51.349]  I mean everything from 3A to
[03:12:53.046 --> 03:12:58.681]  You know, 7mm mag to 38 special.
[03:12:58.681 --> 03:12:59.924]  I mean, they're just buying it all!
[03:13:01.152 --> 03:13:02.472]  They've got it bought out years.
[03:13:02.472 --> 03:13:04.373]  They can't even manufacture it fast enough.
[03:13:04.373 --> 03:13:10.734]  I want to know why manufacturers aren't creating a coalition to sell to citizens and to say, we're not selling to the feds.
[03:13:10.734 --> 03:13:16.335]  There's already some coalitions saying, it's very large, saying we're not going to sell guns to departments that are anti-gun.
[03:13:16.335 --> 03:13:19.456]  Man, it's a big deal that we've dropped the crime rate 49% since 1991.
[03:13:19.456 --> 03:13:20.656]  That's the latest numbers is 91 to 2011.
[03:13:20.656 --> 03:13:21.336]  20 year
[03:13:27.477 --> 03:13:31.980]  Official FBI, local numbers, very accurate, the world standard in statistics.
[03:13:31.980 --> 03:13:34.502]  You can say a lot about J. Edgar Hoover, but he did get statistics down.
[03:13:34.502 --> 03:13:35.823]  He was obsessed with it.
[03:13:35.823 --> 03:13:40.466]  He pretty much launched the modern science of statistics that actually codified off local numbers.
[03:13:40.466 --> 03:13:43.308]  And it's a 49 whopper!
[03:13:43.308 --> 03:13:44.328]  49 whopper!
[03:13:44.328 --> 03:13:50.192]  I mean, criminals are scared, and then they say, well, you don't need semi-auto to protect yourself from criminals.
[03:13:50.192 --> 03:13:53.034]  I saw a video online that we're going to play on the Nightly News tonight.
[03:13:53.034 --> 03:13:54.255]  I'm going to add some updates to it.
[03:13:55.410 --> 03:14:01.693]  Where, you know, the top ten robbers shot, and it shows robbers running in actually shooting people, they get shot.
[03:14:01.693 --> 03:14:03.254]  And you need semi-auto.
[03:14:03.254 --> 03:14:05.135]  The robbers have semi-auto.
[03:14:05.135 --> 03:14:12.259]  Hey, police, if we don't need semi-auto to protect ourselves, we just need a double-barrel shotgun, I got an idea for you.
[03:14:12.259 --> 03:14:13.819]  You don't need semi-auto either.
[03:14:13.819 --> 03:14:15.620]  I am now for gun control.
[03:14:15.620 --> 03:14:19.462]  Just like Jesse Ventura said, you turn your guns in now.
[03:14:19.462 --> 03:14:20.723]  You turn your guns in now.
[03:14:21.738 --> 03:14:30.485]  You turn your guns in, government, you turn in all the semi-autos, and you turn in the bullets, and you turn in the armored vehicles and the drones and the body armor.
[03:14:30.485 --> 03:14:31.385]  I mean, what do you need that for?
[03:14:31.385 --> 03:14:35.649]  Because you don't need those to protect yourself defensively.
[03:14:36.476 --> 03:14:37.756]  Of course, that's not true, actually.
[03:14:37.756 --> 03:14:39.377]  You need semi-auto.
[03:14:39.377 --> 03:14:40.817]  They fetishize full-auto.
[03:14:40.817 --> 03:14:44.078]  You don't need that because it'll spray your whole clip and it doesn't hit what you're aiming at.
[03:14:44.078 --> 03:14:48.779]  You need semi-auto for target acquisition and the whole nine yards.
[03:14:48.779 --> 03:14:50.659]  You've got an enemy with semi-auto.
[03:14:50.659 --> 03:14:52.440]  The criminals will always have semi-auto.
[03:14:52.440 --> 03:14:54.160]  And I know you know this as gun owners.
[03:14:54.160 --> 03:14:56.380]  The general public doesn't know it.
[03:14:56.380 --> 03:14:56.580]  Okay?
[03:14:56.580 --> 03:14:57.861]  And they're going to ban our guns.
[03:14:57.861 --> 03:14:58.561]  They're coming.
[03:14:58.561 --> 03:15:00.381]  They're going to stage more Sandy Hooks.
[03:15:00.381 --> 03:15:02.042]  Folks, let me tell you, they staged all these things.
[03:15:02.042 --> 03:15:02.782]  I've looked at them now.
[03:15:03.602 --> 03:15:04.983]  I mean, they are a bunch of murderers.
[03:15:04.983 --> 03:15:15.689]  When you see those pro-gun confiscation people on TV, a lot of them licking their lips going, you know, too bad Harry Reid's kids aren't, you know, grandkids aren't dead and all this, and let's show the dead kids and all this.
[03:15:15.689 --> 03:15:17.890]  You're looking at some monsters, let me tell you.
[03:15:17.890 --> 03:15:20.652]  A lot of them are in on the fact, okay?
[03:15:20.652 --> 03:15:22.033]  They know full well.
[03:15:22.033 --> 03:15:25.235]  This is about, they're not trying to get your guns because they really care about kids.
[03:15:25.235 --> 03:15:28.156]  These are monster authoritarian scum.
[03:15:28.156 --> 03:15:28.737]  Okay?
[03:15:28.737 --> 03:15:32.319]  Anybody wants your guns, they want to dominate you and your family, and you know it.
[03:15:33.404 --> 03:15:37.688]  Let's go to Michael Moore speaking of a disgusting pig-like creature.
[03:15:37.688 --> 03:15:42.533]  His soul is pig-like, not because he's obese and looks like a... that's mean to pigs.
[03:15:42.533 --> 03:15:47.437]  This is a guy who has five to six bodyguards armed, owns guns, has people been arrested having guns in illegal areas.
[03:15:47.437 --> 03:15:57.407]  This pig, this maggot, this hypocritical blob who works for the globalists and the tyrants, who poses as a liberal, this authoritarian scumbag enemy of humanity,
[03:15:58.402 --> 03:16:03.964]  Okay, this guy says it's basically racist to own guns, scared white people.
[03:16:03.964 --> 03:16:08.585]  I mean, you are such a piece of garbage trying to create racial division as best you can.
[03:16:08.585 --> 03:16:19.029]  Let's go ahead and go to the pig, the garbage, the filth, the words not described, the degeneracy and the lyrical evil of this viper.
[03:16:19.029 --> 03:16:19.829]  Here is Michael Moore.
[03:16:20.709 --> 03:16:27.712]  Do you realize that over 90% of the guns in this country are owned by white people in the suburbs and in rural areas?
[03:16:27.712 --> 03:16:32.333]  90% of our guns are not owned by African-Americans, Hispanics, minority groups.
[03:16:32.333 --> 03:16:33.914]  They're owned by white people.
[03:16:33.914 --> 03:16:37.535]  Now, what are these white people so afraid of out in the suburbs?
[03:16:37.535 --> 03:16:43.497]  Are they thinking little redhead freckle-faced Jimmy down the street is going to, you know, kill them?
[03:16:43.497 --> 03:16:43.997]  Mug them?
[03:16:43.997 --> 03:16:44.578]  Actually, they are.
[03:16:44.578 --> 03:16:45.158]  I don't think so.
[03:16:45.638 --> 03:16:49.901]  Are they afraid the guy next door is gonna break in and steal their TV?
[03:16:49.901 --> 03:16:54.644]  No, because they know the guy next door makes $50,000-$60,000 a year.
[03:16:54.644 --> 03:16:59.167]  So, poverty and racism... See, this is a redistribution deal.
[03:16:59.167 --> 03:17:01.048]  It's pretty much the same answer for a lot of our other problems.
[03:17:01.048 --> 03:17:01.529]  That's enough.
[03:17:01.529 --> 03:17:02.269]  We're not editing it.
[03:17:02.269 --> 03:17:04.351]  Just cut out in the YouTube clip.
[03:17:04.351 --> 03:17:08.433]  Okay, and the full clip's up on InfoWars.com if you want to go watch it.
[03:17:08.433 --> 03:17:09.654]  But, I mean, there it is.
[03:17:09.654 --> 03:17:12.476]  You are inherently bad if you've got $50,000 a year.
[03:17:12.476 --> 03:17:12.996]  That's the new rich.
[03:17:16.038 --> 03:17:20.620]  If you've saved a hundred thousand euros that in Europe, I mean, it's so expensive in Europe.
[03:17:20.620 --> 03:17:38.629]  That's like having $30,000 saved on average 30th imagine if you save your whole life of $30,000 so you could retire for one year You need a million dollars now to really retire comfortably and say live 15 years Of course now they're saying you can't retire to your 80 or something.
[03:17:38.629 --> 03:17:40.090]  Okay?
[03:17:40.090 --> 03:17:40.270]  so
[03:17:41.610 --> 03:17:47.373]  If you look at all of this and you break all this down, what is Michael Moore saying?
[03:17:47.373 --> 03:18:00.540]  He's saying that it is inherently bad, A, to be white and to live in the suburbs and have $50,000, $60,000 a year, and that you're racist because you don't want someone to expropriate your wealth and rob you.
[03:18:00.540 --> 03:18:01.941]  And by the way, let me tell you something.
[03:18:01.941 --> 03:18:07.484]  Living out in the country, if there are mainly, quote, white people in your area, you're worried about white people breaking into your house or anybody.
[03:18:08.220 --> 03:18:14.912]  I mean, I don't talk to anybody who goes, I've got guns because I'm worried black people are going to come out here and rob us.
[03:18:14.912 --> 03:18:19.139]  You know, actually in the country, it'll be like meth head hillbillies that rob your house.
[03:18:20.465 --> 03:18:34.294]  And now, if I was in a predominantly black neighborhood, say Harlem, that has a high crime rate on black and white, doesn't matter, then I might statistically be scared of guys that look like criminals who happen to be black.
[03:18:34.294 --> 03:18:39.378]  Just like if I pulled up and saw hillbilly type meth heads, you know, with the big mullets running out of my garage.
[03:18:40.422 --> 03:18:42.763]  You know, throwing something back in a truck, I'd say, oh, they're robbing my house.
[03:18:42.763 --> 03:18:45.744]  I mean, you know, I mean, you can tell trashy people, period.
[03:18:45.744 --> 03:18:47.845]  But see, everything is racial.
[03:18:47.845 --> 03:18:53.848]  You're not allowed to try to move out of the agenda 21 cities and have a garden and have some chickens and have a shotgun.
[03:18:53.848 --> 03:18:54.788]  You're not allowed to.
[03:18:54.788 --> 03:19:01.551]  You're inherently bad because you're white and you have now moved out to the countryside.
[03:19:01.551 --> 03:19:08.334]  You're scared racist white people because you don't want to live in the wonderland like Detroit that big government creates.
[03:19:09.445 --> 03:19:11.791]  We're going to skip this network break here.
[03:19:11.791 --> 03:19:16.943]  Let's go ahead and talk to Jake listening on XM 166.
[03:19:16.943 --> 03:19:17.605]  Go ahead, Jake.
[03:19:17.605 --> 03:19:18.086]  You're on the air.
[03:19:18.086 --> 03:19:18.648]  Thanks for holding.
[03:19:21.975 --> 03:19:31.642]  Have you ever looked into the hierarchy of the world, i.e.
[03:19:31.642 --> 03:19:39.568]  Rothschilds and Illuminati, and what they actually believe, and the Satanist beliefs that they have, being that Gnosticism?
[03:19:39.568 --> 03:19:40.489]  They're not Satanists.
[03:19:40.489 --> 03:19:42.371]  Satanists are kind of their minions.
[03:19:42.371 --> 03:19:43.672]  They're Luciferians.
[03:19:45.447 --> 03:19:50.317]  Have you ever looked into Gnosticism and the beliefs held by Gnostics?
[03:19:50.317 --> 03:19:53.483]  I know it's not a belief that we look... No, no, I've studied it.
[03:19:53.483 --> 03:19:54.385]  I've studied it.
[03:19:54.385 --> 03:19:56.729]  It's a very diverse group, but I have looked into it, yes.
[03:19:57.677 --> 03:20:15.645]  I mean, the hierarchy in the masonry, in which I belong to, in which I rejected, is all about Gnosticism, and the further you go up into that, it is essentially controlled by Satan, and it's just a misinterpretation of the Bible when adding different parts.
[03:20:15.645 --> 03:20:21.928]  Sure, they believe Lucifer is God, and Jesus is the devil.
[03:20:21.928 --> 03:20:23.369]  Absolutely, that's absolutely right.
[03:20:24.304 --> 03:20:27.605]  And a belief of another god named Sophia as well.
[03:20:27.605 --> 03:20:36.788]  But those hierarchy in the Rothschilds and all those people have this skewed view of the way religion is held and the beliefs that they have and are not.
[03:20:36.788 --> 03:20:44.350]  Well they also believe they're bringing balance to everything and so killing us is good because we deserve to be killed because we're profane, ugly and bad.
[03:20:44.350 --> 03:20:50.711]  But then they do everything they can to make us ugly and dumb and dumbed down and fighting with each other as a self-fulfilling prophecy.
[03:20:50.711 --> 03:20:52.512]  It's really done from a position of weakness.
[03:20:53.968 --> 03:20:55.750]  Absolutely, you're absolutely correct.
[03:20:55.750 --> 03:20:58.714]  That's what the devil would want to do.
[03:20:58.714 --> 03:21:07.786]  I mean, I know that not all of your listeners are Christian, but just think about the evil, inherently evil in these people's mind that they want to control us and to kill us.
[03:21:08.968 --> 03:21:16.053]  The government is on record doing tens of thousands of operations, some of which had thousands of operations in it.
[03:21:16.053 --> 03:21:19.636]  Everybody knows about Tuskegee and syphilis giving it to black men, and that's terrible.
[03:21:19.636 --> 03:21:23.699]  But I mean, it's radiating foster kids, nerve-gassing U.S.
[03:21:23.699 --> 03:21:25.781]  troops, bio-weaponing.
[03:21:25.781 --> 03:21:28.083]  I mean, we are animals to them.
[03:21:28.083 --> 03:21:34.708]  And then I've shot a YouTube video about it, and there are lazy people on there going, show me where they gave black men syphilis.
[03:21:34.708 --> 03:21:35.328]  I mean, there's just...
[03:21:36.329 --> 03:21:38.871]  It'd be like, show me Washington D.C.
[03:21:38.871 --> 03:21:40.553]  and that the Washington Monument exists.
[03:21:40.553 --> 03:21:45.156]  It's like, you know, it's like they wear their ignorance as a shield, but it doesn't protect them.
[03:21:45.156 --> 03:21:46.818]  God bless you, good to hear from you.
[03:21:46.818 --> 03:21:52.182]  Let's go to Jock, listening on the audio streams at Infowars.com.
[03:21:52.182 --> 03:21:53.983]  You're on the air, sir.
[03:21:53.983 --> 03:21:57.066]  Alex, great interview with Billy Corgan.
[03:21:57.066 --> 03:22:02.350]  Yeah, I mean, I think that interview is really powerful and very important.
[03:22:02.350 --> 03:22:05.573]  What do you think about a victories column on the Infowars homepage?
[03:22:06.391 --> 03:22:06.971]  I agree.
[03:22:06.971 --> 03:22:22.479]  I have already said about 10 times, and not that my crew isn't working hard, but I want to get an activist section, not just on PlanetInfoWorks.com, but on the front page, an activist section and a victory section, a good news section and a action section.
[03:22:22.479 --> 03:22:23.500]  And we're going to add those.
[03:22:23.500 --> 03:22:24.400]  Yes, sir.
[03:22:24.400 --> 03:22:25.300]  I'm going to write that down right now.
[03:22:25.300 --> 03:22:27.702]  Go ahead.
[03:22:27.702 --> 03:22:28.502]  What do you think about
[03:22:31.496 --> 03:22:38.479]  You know, the psychology of bullying, obviously from the schoolyard we know there's just one way to stop a bully and that's to resist them.
[03:22:38.479 --> 03:22:41.400]  But one way to resist is to laugh at them.
[03:22:41.400 --> 03:22:48.062]  And I think that your videos that you post where you make fun of the bullies, those are the ones that get you in trouble with YouTube.
[03:22:48.829 --> 03:22:54.134]  Yes, anytime myself or Mike Adams do that and there's nothing that breaks YouTube's rules, they ban them.
[03:22:54.134 --> 03:22:59.239]  They really hate being powerfully made fun of and made to look weak like they are.
[03:22:59.239 --> 03:23:08.407]  The globalists all try to have extra power because they're scared deep down and they have this narcissistic image of themselves as this thing they aren't really.
[03:23:09.198 --> 03:23:10.738]  That's why the power trip happens.
[03:23:10.738 --> 03:23:17.100]  Like, someone with real power, who's not evil, is embarrassed to exercise it.
[03:23:17.100 --> 03:23:21.380]  And is embarrassed to use it even when someone deserves to have it used on them.
[03:23:21.380 --> 03:23:22.621]  And that's why we're in this straight.
[03:23:22.621 --> 03:23:28.722]  Good, powerful people do not ever manifest their power because they think it's arrogant to manifest it.
[03:23:28.722 --> 03:23:29.562]  Well, you know what?
[03:23:29.562 --> 03:23:34.623]  If you don't manifest the power God gave you, you will be enslaved by the cancerous globalist.
[03:23:36.328 --> 03:23:45.393]  Well, you can see how people like Dick Cheney love it when you come up to them and ask them their serious opinion on this serious political issue.
[03:23:45.393 --> 03:23:46.813]  We shouldn't be asking them anything.
[03:23:46.813 --> 03:23:51.756]  We should be laughing at them, because their opinions don't matter.
[03:23:51.756 --> 03:23:52.576]  Well, that's right.
[03:23:52.576 --> 03:23:56.718]  That's why one lady was crying, the head producer, the other was red in the face.
[03:23:56.718 --> 03:23:57.899]  Men had their fists ready.
[03:23:57.899 --> 03:23:59.560]  And I just said, you're all just agents.
[03:23:59.560 --> 03:24:00.260]  You're pathetic.
[03:24:00.260 --> 03:24:03.762]  And then, when I wasn't scared, the men bowing up to me and saying, get out of here.
[03:24:04.062 --> 03:24:06.143]  When I said, oh, you're a pathetic little minion.
[03:24:06.143 --> 03:24:07.904]  You don't have what it takes to do something to me.
[03:24:07.904 --> 03:24:09.144]  You're just posturing.
[03:24:09.144 --> 03:24:18.969]  They all looked totally freaked out, and the men all went from going like this to like... Because I walked right into their little... I wish I would have done more.
[03:24:18.969 --> 03:24:21.831]  I walked right into their little dungeon and just said, this is all fake.
[03:24:21.831 --> 03:24:23.031]  It's all garbage.
[03:24:23.031 --> 03:24:24.292]  And it shook them up.
[03:24:25.272 --> 03:24:27.053]  And not that I did something that great either.
[03:24:27.053 --> 03:24:31.233]  In fact, I made the mistake of even trying to give him facts and debate him at all.
[03:24:31.233 --> 03:24:36.675]  Because, you know, I mean, I should have really hammered down his butt and said, you know it's about making us slaves.
[03:24:36.675 --> 03:24:39.255]  You know they've taken all the guns everywhere you globalists are in control.
[03:24:39.255 --> 03:24:41.596]  I got to some of that.
[03:24:41.596 --> 03:24:49.938]  But I mean, when I watched Dianne Feinstein going, we're going to get these bills passed if not this year, the next, because there will be more incidents.
[03:24:49.938 --> 03:24:52.579]  And she smiles for just a minute and her tongue flicks.
[03:24:52.579 --> 03:24:54.239]  It's like, I can't even do the demonic face.
[03:24:56.081 --> 03:24:58.243]  We're gonna get what we want soon enough!
[03:24:58.243 --> 03:25:00.165]  Oh yeah!
[03:25:00.165 --> 03:25:02.827]  Oh, right now it's all being planned.
[03:25:02.827 --> 03:25:05.029]  And man, it's hard to look at these people and know who they are.
[03:25:05.029 --> 03:25:15.118]  That's why I get mad at minions who I know aren't evil, like the Austin Police Chief, who is going and selling out to this, because he's just doing it for power down the road.
[03:25:16.201 --> 03:25:19.426]  And, you know, and privately has admitted, oh, I know this stuff's all crazy.
[03:25:19.426 --> 03:25:27.377]  And either he's a psychopath liar, or he's a little minion who isn't an evil guy, but he's selling out to the whole deal.
[03:25:27.377 --> 03:25:31.242]  Oh, you guys found the video where she talks about there will be more incidences and smiles?
[03:25:31.883 --> 03:25:32.663]  Yeah, yeah.
[03:25:32.663 --> 03:25:34.264]  OK, thank you for the call, sir.
[03:25:34.264 --> 03:25:36.685]  Let's cue that right up to the point.
[03:25:36.685 --> 03:25:40.687]  But again, the eyes smile like, hey, you think we're not getting your guns?
[03:25:40.687 --> 03:25:41.547]  We are.
[03:25:41.547 --> 03:25:45.309]  And even if it wakes us up, they don't care because it's about that domination.
[03:25:45.309 --> 03:25:47.370]  They want that war with us.
[03:25:47.370 --> 03:25:50.211]  They're not going to be the ones dying like the police and military.
[03:25:50.211 --> 03:25:51.332]  Soon they're going to have robots.
[03:25:52.924 --> 03:25:58.607]  All they care about, even if it happens after they're dead, is that good people be tortured and destroyed.
[03:25:58.607 --> 03:26:11.215]  And before they can do that, before demons like Michael Moore can have his communist ways with us in his re-education camps, and you know, all of his evil, you heard him, the guy worth $50 million, $100 million, maybe more, going, people with $60,000 are bad!
[03:26:11.215 --> 03:26:12.295]  Bad white people!
[03:26:17.058 --> 03:26:18.799]  What he wants is to eat them!
[03:26:18.799 --> 03:26:28.163]  What he wants is just his big belly to lay it on him spiritually like Jabba and just squat on you with all his SWAT teams and armaments and have his bodyguards beat you up.
[03:26:28.163 --> 03:26:29.043]  I am the blob.
[03:26:29.043 --> 03:26:29.923]  I am the king.
[03:26:29.923 --> 03:26:31.184]  I am your royal.
[03:26:31.184 --> 03:26:38.407]  I plant the flag of pus and diarrhea that is the scumbag Michael Moore on the planet.
[03:26:38.407 --> 03:26:39.507]  I'm sorry.
[03:26:39.507 --> 03:26:40.188]  That's what he is.
[03:26:42.970 --> 03:26:44.650]  I gotta stop it, ladies and gentlemen.
[03:26:44.650 --> 03:26:51.172]  Here is Dianne Feinstein relishing in her eyes, relishing future incidents and her victory over America.
[03:26:51.172 --> 03:26:52.312]  Here it is.
[03:26:52.312 --> 03:26:59.674]  But I also know that these events are going to continue and America has to step up.
[03:26:59.674 --> 03:27:00.514]  Oh, did you see that?
[03:27:00.514 --> 03:27:01.995]  The mothers, the women, the men of America.
[03:27:01.995 --> 03:27:03.195]  Back it up and pause it right on there.
[03:27:03.195 --> 03:27:06.576]  I mean, boy, her entity that's in control of her comes right through right there.
[03:27:07.461 --> 03:27:11.542]  I mean, look at that, it's just like, ha ha ha, there will be more!
[03:27:11.542 --> 03:27:12.742]  You'd know, wouldn't you, Ms.
[03:27:12.742 --> 03:27:14.263]  Fast and Furious?
[03:27:14.263 --> 03:27:16.943]  Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha!
[03:27:16.943 --> 03:27:19.404]  Oh, yeah!
[03:27:19.404 --> 03:27:21.605]  Oh, babycakes!
[03:27:21.605 --> 03:27:23.505]  I know it's hard to pause the video because it moves back and forth.
[03:27:23.505 --> 03:27:25.305]  Just pause it right on the smile.
[03:27:25.305 --> 03:27:27.066]  She goes, there will be more.
[03:27:27.066 --> 03:27:28.306]  And then she smiles.
[03:27:28.306 --> 03:27:31.087]  A little bit more.
[03:27:33.442 --> 03:27:35.843]  Look at those eyes!
[03:27:35.843 --> 03:27:43.025]  See, what I do is when I think about how evil they are, I kind of just, as somebody who can almost extreme what I'm seeing, that's the feeling of it.
[03:27:43.025 --> 03:27:46.406]  It's like, listen, I have the savage will.
[03:27:46.406 --> 03:27:50.567]  There will be more incidents, so I bet more people on DARPA payrolls.
[03:27:50.567 --> 03:27:54.588]  More people you have to drug up for trial, witchy poo.
[03:27:54.588 --> 03:27:56.349]  Oh, look at her.
[03:27:56.349 --> 03:27:57.449]  America is hers.
[03:27:58.231 --> 03:27:59.551]  It's all hers.
[03:27:59.551 --> 03:28:00.732]  It's all hers.
[03:28:00.732 --> 03:28:06.234]  You know, I think Melissa Melton made this graphic of hers like Elvira.
[03:28:06.234 --> 03:28:07.914]  But see, that's not scary enough.
[03:28:07.914 --> 03:28:09.815]  No, no, just the real person.
[03:28:09.815 --> 03:28:10.956]  Look at the eyes there.
[03:28:10.956 --> 03:28:14.417]  And look how the eyebrows smiled.
[03:28:14.417 --> 03:28:15.737]  The eyebrows smiled.
[03:28:15.737 --> 03:28:18.478]  There will be more incidents.
[03:28:18.478 --> 03:28:22.780]  And that brings a smile to your face, doesn't it, toots?
[03:28:22.780 --> 03:28:23.440]  Oh, yeah.
[03:28:25.979 --> 03:28:29.202]  And take your shots, Dianne Feinstein.
[03:28:29.202 --> 03:28:31.723]  Wants you to have a fun cancer.
[03:28:31.723 --> 03:28:35.346]  Oh, what a sweetie cake.
[03:28:35.346 --> 03:28:36.867]  What a sweetie pie.
[03:28:36.867 --> 03:28:37.928]  Yeah, no need to demonize her.
[03:28:37.928 --> 03:28:39.149]  Just show her.
[03:28:39.149 --> 03:28:41.211]  Talks about dead kids.
[03:28:41.211 --> 03:28:42.692]  Talks about how there will be more.
[03:28:42.692 --> 03:28:46.315]  And that doesn't bring a smile to your face when you're a demon?
[03:28:46.315 --> 03:28:47.696]  I mean, it's a satisfaction for her.
[03:28:47.696 --> 03:28:49.957]  And she's like, I've seen the dead bodies of the children.
[03:28:49.957 --> 03:28:51.539]  I saw her smile on another TV show.
[03:28:51.539 --> 03:28:53.300]  She came in and she fights it back.
[03:28:53.300 --> 03:28:54.001]  Oh, dead kids.
[03:28:58.343 --> 03:29:00.683]  I mean, it is just so hard for her.
[03:29:00.683 --> 03:29:03.104]  There will be more dead kids.
[03:29:03.104 --> 03:29:05.585]  I'm real sad about that.
[03:29:05.585 --> 03:29:06.685]  I've got a concealed carry.
[03:29:06.685 --> 03:29:08.545]  I've got bodyguards.
[03:29:08.545 --> 03:29:12.366]  I came to Congress, you know, not even worth a million dollars, now over a hundred million.
[03:29:12.366 --> 03:29:13.527]  I'm Dianne Feinstein!
[03:29:13.527 --> 03:29:14.567]  I dominate you!
[03:29:14.567 --> 03:29:16.087]  And you lay down and take it!
[03:29:16.087 --> 03:29:16.968]  I am your king!
[03:29:16.968 --> 03:29:18.008]  I am your royalty!
[03:29:18.008 --> 03:29:18.868]  I am your god!
[03:29:18.868 --> 03:29:21.869]  I am the witch of hell!
[03:29:23.326 --> 03:29:26.588]  And I just sit there in an infantile way calling Michael more names.
[03:29:26.588 --> 03:29:35.514]  It's just that he's such a holy, demonic, nasty creature who knows he's authoritarian and knows he will break your will!
[03:29:35.514 --> 03:29:37.235]  He will take this country!
[03:29:37.235 --> 03:29:38.977]  He will take your tax money!
[03:29:38.977 --> 03:29:40.658]  And he will build armaments against you!
[03:29:41.278 --> 03:29:43.340]  And he will take everything you've got.
[03:29:43.340 --> 03:29:44.702]  You evil white people.
[03:29:44.702 --> 03:29:45.362]  You heard him.
[03:29:45.362 --> 03:29:48.305]  There's nothing worse than a white person living in the country.
[03:29:48.305 --> 03:29:49.847]  He's gonna get you good.
[03:29:49.847 --> 03:29:50.748]  Take your shots.
[03:29:50.748 --> 03:29:52.149]  We're on the march.
[03:29:52.149 --> 03:29:53.731]  The empire's on the run.
[03:29:53.731 --> 03:29:55.293]  Alex Jones and the GCN media.
[03:29:55.293 --> 03:29:59.097]  The truth is he wants to get all the quote minorities under his wing so he can take care of them.
[03:29:59.097 --> 03:30:00.398]  Oh, that's the real friend.
