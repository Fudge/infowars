[00:00.000 --> 00:12.120]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government cover-ups. You want answers? Well, so does
[00:12.120 --> 00:25.960]  he. He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network. And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:25.960 --> 00:32.720]  It is the 25th day of March, 2013, on this Monday edition. I am your host, Alex Jones,
[00:32.720 --> 00:40.040]  and we are going to be live here for the next three hours. I've been watching cable, so-called
[00:40.040 --> 00:45.400]  television news, listening to local radio with syndicated news. And they're announcing,
[00:45.400 --> 00:53.040]  hey, Cyprus got the help they needed. The EU and central banks came to their aid, and
[00:53.040 --> 00:57.680]  they got a bailout, aren't they lucky? Not, they're rioting all over the country and burning
[00:57.680 --> 01:06.400]  things down. There's a compromise, the top 40% will have 10% or more taken out of their
[01:06.400 --> 01:07.400]  bank account.
[01:07.400 --> 01:11.640]  And that's causing investment to flee the country, which causes it to implode further,
[01:11.640 --> 01:16.200]  so the globalists can come in and buy it up for pennies on the dollar. Nowhere in our
[01:16.200 --> 01:22.480]  news, nowhere that I could see on television news, was it made a point of watching some
[01:22.480 --> 01:31.440]  of it to see if it was taking place. In financial news, on CNBC, on Fox News Radio, nowhere
[01:31.440 --> 01:35.480]  now are they talking about taking money out of people's bank accounts.
[01:35.480 --> 01:42.840]  And that it's being transferred to the EU to prop up derivatives. It is just absolutely
[01:42.840 --> 01:48.360]  incredible that Iceland and Greece and all these other countries, 90 plus percent of
[01:48.360 --> 01:53.220]  their debt is not their debt. They've been signed on to this system, they've been signed
[01:53.220 --> 01:56.320]  on to all of the different derivatives.
[01:56.320 --> 02:00.400]  And it's the same thing here, and that's what's going on, that's what's happening. We've got
[02:00.400 --> 02:08.720]  a big stack of news on that front that we're gonna be covering. We've also got Boris Berevasky,
[02:08.720 --> 02:14.520]  the big anti-Putin guy, found dead in his bathroom. And the police just instantly said
[02:14.520 --> 02:18.760]  it's natural causes, no autopsy needed, that's when you know something's suspicious.
[02:18.760 --> 02:24.040]  Cuz it takes bare minimum of a week or so to get an autopsy properly done and all the
[02:24.040 --> 02:31.120]  toxicology exams back. When you instantly, within hours, or in Breitbart, 45 minutes,
[02:31.120 --> 02:35.920]  I checked the time, about 45 minutes, they're saying nothing to worry about, not foul play,
[02:35.920 --> 02:37.560]  heart attack, heart attack.
[02:37.560 --> 02:41.920]  As soon as you hear that, I mean, this guy had a scarf lying beside him, even leave the
[02:41.920 --> 02:47.040]  murder weapon. And he'd said that Putin was after him, but it could have been another
[02:47.040 --> 02:51.600]  globalist faction killing him to steal the tens of billions he had ferreted away and
[02:51.600 --> 02:52.600]  hid in different places.
[02:52.600 --> 02:57.280]  We're gonna be breaking that down. And now it's one of the biggest stories in the country.
[02:57.280 --> 03:03.800]  It's up at DrudgeReport.com, the big top link right now. If you're listening and rebroadcast
[03:03.800 --> 03:07.800]  later, it may have scrolled down the page or you can always find it at Infowars.com.
[03:07.800 --> 03:17.000]  360,000 more rounds on top of the two plus billion and 15 members of Congress have now
[03:17.000 --> 03:21.120]  asked to see details and have been told to basically go fly a kite, jump in the lake.
[03:21.120 --> 03:25.560]  Well, that's a nice way to put it. And so this arms buildup, they said there are no
[03:25.560 --> 03:27.400]  armored vehicles, there are no bullets.
[03:27.400 --> 03:34.280]  And in fact, they're in US News and World Report denying bullet purchases. In fact,
[03:34.280 --> 03:48.640]  it's the headline out of US News and World Report is that there just are no bullet purchases
[03:48.640 --> 03:50.960]  and so we should all just move along.
[03:50.960 --> 03:56.320]  The point is there's a total paramilitary buildup against the American people. And by
[03:56.320 --> 04:03.840]  the way, I am for gun control. I don't think government should be deploying tanks and armored
[04:03.840 --> 04:09.880]  vehicles and checkpoints and heavy machine guns and drones while saying they want our
[04:09.880 --> 04:10.880]  guns.
[04:10.880 --> 04:14.840]  So yes, you've got all these government abuses throughout history. You've got this government
[04:14.840 --> 04:20.960]  abusing people over and over again. Isn't it time to talk about government sensible,
[04:20.960 --> 04:26.280]  reasonable gun control? Because the Austin police chief says, ban gun shows basically.
[04:26.280 --> 04:30.240]  Don't allow private transfers, can't buy your grandson a gun.
[04:30.240 --> 04:34.440]  Basically registration. He's up there testifying in Congress. I guess his communist training
[04:34.440 --> 04:38.880]  in Cuba is coming through. He swears he's not a communist and loves liberty. But that's
[04:38.880 --> 04:44.280]  pretty authoritarian art, Acevedo. But he was up there with the Clintonistas and the
[04:44.280 --> 04:49.120]  Obamanoids calling for that and saying you don't need a semi-auto to protect yourself.
[04:49.120 --> 04:55.200]  Well, then cops don't. I want the police to turn their semi-autos in right now if we don't
[04:55.200 --> 05:00.920]  need them to defend ourselves. They don't either.

[05:04.680 --> 05:08.880]  you're listening, you know, the economy is not getting better. You know, gas and food

[08:06.440 --> 08:31.280]  and domestic, it is Alex Jones. It is Monday, the 25th day of March 2013. I am your host
[08:31.280 --> 08:35.080]  Alex Jones. We are going to be here live for the next three hours. Again, thank you so
[08:35.080 --> 08:42.740]  much for joining us. Well, you have got a global cartel of private banks that have taken
[08:42.740 --> 08:49.000]  over Europe, taken over the United States and most of the world now and they are openly
[08:49.000 --> 08:55.680]  saying that we need to not be able to take a hot bath or hot shower under the UN regulations
[08:55.680 --> 08:59.280]  and that we need to not have a car and that we are using too much energy and that we need
[08:59.280 --> 09:05.040]  to live in 250 square foot apartments and they are saying all over the US and Europe
[09:05.040 --> 09:10.800]  they are going to raise taxes to the point of where you have to live in a 250 square
[09:10.800 --> 09:14.920]  foot apartment or it is impossible to pay the taxes.
[09:14.920 --> 09:20.240]  That is going in San Francisco, New York, Germany is doing it countrywide. It is all
[09:20.240 --> 09:26.200]  part of the United Nations Industrial Development Organization plan and treaties and agreements
[09:26.200 --> 09:34.400]  from the 50s, 60s and 70s that are the root of Agenda 21 codified into world government
[09:34.400 --> 09:44.280]  regulatory law in 1992 in Rio de Janeiro and this is why they are raising the taxes.
[09:44.280 --> 09:49.480]  This is why they are creating regulations that make it impossible to have a new business
[09:49.480 --> 09:54.700]  operate successfully, especially in manufacturing in the West. They are now going to shut down
[09:54.700 --> 09:59.920]  the service industry as well. They want you totally bankrupted so that you will then have
[09:59.920 --> 10:06.160]  to comply in the social engineering to the government jobs and the select globalist corporate
[10:06.160 --> 10:12.560]  jobs that are able to hire because they are exempt from all of the regulations, the carbon
[10:12.560 --> 10:16.400]  regulations, the offshoring regulations, all of it.
[10:16.400 --> 10:22.200]  This is the planned deindustrialization and then if you dare try to operate oil refineries
[10:22.200 --> 10:27.880]  or coal mining operations or steel production in the United States, Europe, England, Australia,
[10:27.880 --> 10:34.360]  New Zealand, Canada, you name it, you will be assaulted and sued as Obama promised to
[10:34.360 --> 10:39.280]  do, quote, to bankrupt coal. If you ever wonder why you hear such demonization of the Koch
[10:39.280 --> 10:45.680]  brothers, it's because they are some of the biggest factory owners in the United States
[10:45.680 --> 10:52.400]  and because they are the biggest coal mining and refining outfit in the United States.
[10:52.400 --> 10:57.840]  And they keep the lights on. Do I romanticize that and think they're angels? Not particularly,
[10:57.840 --> 11:03.280]  I've spent months off and on as of late trying to dig up some dirt on them that isn't manufactured
[11:03.280 --> 11:04.280]  or fake.
[11:04.280 --> 11:09.760]  And about the worst thing I can find is something that all major oil companies, supply companies
[11:09.760 --> 11:14.840]  have been done because loopholes were written. They've sold equipment, oil refining equipment
[11:14.840 --> 11:20.520]  to Iran during those decades long sanctions. And the only reason I just went off into the
[11:20.520 --> 11:25.400]  Koch brothers is I'm starting the broadcast describing why the government wants to shut
[11:25.400 --> 11:29.220]  things down and destroy society.
[11:29.220 --> 11:33.560]  Because it's a globalist program where they are exempt from everything and they shut you
[11:33.560 --> 11:38.320]  down. They bombed third world countries under flimsy pretexts and blow up their chemical
[11:38.320 --> 11:44.440]  plants, their water plants, their power plants, their roads, their bridges. Here they don't
[11:44.440 --> 11:47.160]  blow them up, they just shut them down.
[11:47.160 --> 11:51.560]  I had a fellow last Friday, I was in a restaurant with my family and he walked over and he said,
[11:51.560 --> 11:56.600]  you know, I want to thank you for what you've done. You know, I've worked in Austin Energy.
[11:56.600 --> 12:02.360]  And he said, you know, they've shut down our two power plants, clean burning, modern, and
[12:02.360 --> 12:03.840]  they're shutting down the third one.
[12:03.840 --> 12:06.920]  And he goes, you're right, it's doubled prices the last five years and they're gonna double
[12:06.920 --> 12:12.080]  again. He goes, my God, and the public's so dumb, they don't even know why their power
[12:12.080 --> 12:18.480]  bills doubled. He goes, the guy was just so intense, he was just, I want to thank you.
[12:18.480 --> 12:23.280]  We try to do the best we can as well. And most of us have also been laid off and let
[12:23.280 --> 12:29.520]  go. And I'm like, I guess you can go to work for General Electric, they're exempt from
[12:29.520 --> 12:32.160]  all the rules, they can have dirty burning, you name it.
[12:32.160 --> 12:37.360]  All that comes out of these modern plants last 25 years is water vapor and carbon dioxide.
[12:37.360 --> 12:42.920]  So they list carbon dioxide as a pollutant. GMO is not a pollutant. Overfishing is not
[12:42.920 --> 12:47.760]  an issue. I mean, there are hundreds of real environmental issues. The globalists say they
[12:47.760 --> 12:52.120]  care about the environment, but it's the opposite.
[12:52.120 --> 12:56.480]  The reason I mentioned the Koch brothers before I get into all this huge news today is I constantly
[12:56.480 --> 13:03.500]  see this fake meme that I work for the Koch brothers, that I'm funded by the Koch brothers.
[13:03.500 --> 13:11.720]  But I sure wish I was. I don't have one stock or one bond or one dime that I get or anybody,
[13:11.720 --> 13:18.660]  I mean, my wife, children, any of them get from coal, oil, distillates, anything. I have
[13:18.660 --> 13:21.080]  no stocks, I have no bonds.
[13:21.080 --> 13:25.480]  I take the money that I make off my syndicated radio show. It's the big breadwinner for this
[13:25.480 --> 13:32.600]  whole news operation and plow it into crew and research and equipment. But it doesn't
[13:32.600 --> 13:38.680]  matter that they have media matters and Mother Jones and all these fake liberal groups out
[13:38.680 --> 13:48.440]  there implying anyone that is pro second amendment, anyone that's pro US energy works for the
[13:48.440 --> 13:49.440]  Koch brothers.
[13:49.440 --> 13:55.640]  And then it's like, my gosh, that's so evil. When it's the Enron people that came up with
[13:55.640 --> 14:02.080]  a carbon tax plan with Al Gore on record and it's a plan. I mean, Al Gore is the majority
[14:02.080 --> 14:11.040]  owner of Occidental Petroleum. Al Gore has got tens of billions in offshore accounts.
[14:11.040 --> 14:15.480]  And again, I think we should have moved away from oil. I know there's monopolies on the
[14:15.480 --> 14:19.840]  carburetors and things and they try to block new energy development. And the new energy
[14:19.840 --> 14:22.120]  development we're getting is a fraud.
[14:22.120 --> 14:27.040]  But the point is the globalists are shutting down our industry and shutting down our coal,
[14:27.040 --> 14:33.120]  mainly because big oil wants that. While at the same time, not letting us have new things
[14:33.120 --> 14:37.640]  that actually empower us. I mean, they won't give you a tax credit to put off the grid,
[14:37.640 --> 14:41.880]  solar or wind. And in fact, they'll harass you in most areas, especially if they're quote
[14:41.880 --> 14:45.140]  liberal to not give you a permit.
[14:45.140 --> 14:50.500]  Or they'll say, what's that windmill doing? What's that solar array? And come harass you.
[14:50.500 --> 14:56.300]  So it's not Koch brothers good guys, everybody else bad guys. It's just that I've been constantly
[14:56.300 --> 15:00.080]  accused of working with the Koch brothers with no evidence.
[15:00.080 --> 15:06.520]  And then so I go and I say, well, let me really research the Koch brothers. And so it becomes
[15:06.520 --> 15:13.720]  kind of a little pet project as I do in research. And I discovered that they're anti agenda
[15:13.720 --> 15:19.880]  21. They have quote secret meetings with conservative leaders, and they sneak out the audio and
[15:19.880 --> 15:21.920]  it's how do we defend the Second Amendment?
[15:21.920 --> 15:28.560]  How do we defend the family? How do we keep America competitive? How do we reverse offshoring?
[15:28.560 --> 15:34.200]  I mean, you can go to the Brad blog. We've had that gone before. You know, got the quote
[15:34.200 --> 15:40.720]  secret recordings of years ago with the Republican, you know, libertarian powwow with Judge Napolitano
[15:40.720 --> 15:41.920]  is the keynote speaker.
[15:41.920 --> 15:46.760]  Oh my goodness, the evil. And the whole thing's about we must defend the Second Amendment,
[15:46.760 --> 15:51.480]  the family and property rights. You know, there are collectivist mega rich who want
[15:51.480 --> 15:54.360]  to shut down all the new variation independent rich.
[15:54.360 --> 15:57.840]  I mean, that's what's going on these meetings. One of the head of the Dallas Fed and the
[15:57.840 --> 16:04.240]  head of the of the Kansas City Fed come out last week and say they said crony elite mega
[16:04.240 --> 16:09.080]  banks are going to shut down all the other free market and create a consolidation and
[16:09.080 --> 16:12.120]  destroy our economic future.
[16:12.120 --> 16:17.320]  Even MIT came out a few months ago and said we will never re industrialize. We are in
[16:17.320 --> 16:26.880]  a total emergency situation. That is the kind of stuff that we are talking about here. And
[16:26.880 --> 16:31.560]  so thank God I've been accused for working for the Koch brothers because it made me actually
[16:31.560 --> 16:35.360]  go research them and find out what they're up to and what they're doing.
[16:35.360 --> 16:40.480]  A private family, the second largest private corporation in the country that hasn't merged
[16:40.480 --> 16:45.400]  into tax free foundations. They go to some globalist meetings to protect their interest,
[16:45.400 --> 16:49.720]  obviously. And then they're horrible because they're having secret meetings in Colorado,
[16:49.720 --> 16:50.720]  not not really secret.
[16:50.720 --> 16:55.320]  They're just not for the public. And hours of it gets released. And it's the government
[16:55.320 --> 16:59.140]  wants to destroy the family. The government wants to take our guns. The government's run
[16:59.140 --> 17:06.160]  by authoritarian mega corporations that aren't free market. Oh, my gosh. How do we the independent
[17:06.160 --> 17:16.440]  wealthy defend freedom? Oh, my gosh. Can you imagine the evil level of this?
[17:16.440 --> 17:21.240]  So I'm going to do a report on the Koch brothers as soon as I get time. I've got no exaggeration,
[17:21.240 --> 17:27.120]  about 100 reports partly done or almost completely done. I bought off more than I can shoot.
[17:27.120 --> 17:31.600]  Okay, I mean, there's so much I want to cover. In fact, I'm gonna hook it up at my house
[17:31.600 --> 17:37.080]  now that I finally have good Internet. Finally got some good Internet where I want to set
[17:37.080 --> 17:42.020]  up guys with my IT guys where I could just go in and hit one button.
[17:42.020 --> 17:49.280]  And take over the refeeds on the audio feeds or create podcast that I hit a button, record
[17:49.280 --> 17:52.520]  it, you know, very simple. I mean, I know how to upload stuff to YouTube and things.
[17:52.520 --> 17:57.200]  So the point is, so I can just when I'm really brainstorming at two in the morning, I'm tempted
[17:57.200 --> 18:01.040]  to just have like a room I walk into that I just hit a button and I'm on TV and there's
[18:01.040 --> 18:02.040]  video feeds.
[18:02.040 --> 18:06.240]  Because that's when I have my brainstorms. When I'm here on the radio, there's just so
[18:06.240 --> 18:10.640]  much to cover and ads and guests coming up and we still cover a lot of important things.
[18:10.640 --> 18:15.480]  It's just that I want to do more. And it's just so many times that you see me doing these
[18:15.480 --> 18:19.080]  what listeners call underwear uploads.
[18:19.080 --> 18:24.560]  Sometimes I'll be shirtless shooting video of all that's on the computer screen and people
[18:24.560 --> 18:30.360]  can see that I'm not wearing a shirt occasionally. So it's what's been affectionately dubbed
[18:30.360 --> 18:36.400]  the underwear special reports. But I mean, I'm just desperate to get this info out. I
[18:36.400 --> 18:42.840]  know the globalist plan. I have all the UN documents like United Nations Industrial Development
[18:42.840 --> 18:49.780]  Organization founded in the 1950s to shut down Western industrial systems and actually
[18:49.780 --> 18:52.440]  shut down the third world as well.
[18:52.440 --> 18:58.280]  Only allow globalist combines to operate. I mean, I know their whole battle plan and
[18:58.280 --> 19:05.320]  I know what they're up to. And we are just in so much trouble, ladies and gentlemen,
[19:05.320 --> 19:09.640]  because the mainline Republicans are controlled by the globalist. The Democrats are kind of
[19:09.640 --> 19:15.200]  the vanguard to lead us into the collectivism and its collectivism to have full government
[19:15.200 --> 19:16.200]  control over us.
[19:16.200 --> 19:21.320]  So it's a very nightmarish prospect. Now, when we come back, retired army captain warns
[19:21.320 --> 19:27.740]  DHS acquisitions are bold threat of war against the American people, says Americans have prepared
[19:27.740 --> 19:33.200]  to defend themselves and the U.S. Constitution against the Obama administration coup against
[19:33.200 --> 19:39.880]  the American people. DHS and U.S. News and World Report outright denies any bullet purchases.
[19:39.880 --> 19:44.560]  DHS denies massive ammunition purchases. There you go. Not happening, even though it's all
[19:44.560 --> 19:50.300]  public. Big Sis orders 360,000 rounds more on top of the two billion. That's top story
[19:50.300 --> 19:56.800]  up at drugsreport.com. And we're gonna get into the incredible Cyprus deal. 40% of bank
[19:56.800 --> 20:01.400]  accounts to be loaded. Stay with us.

[20:40.900 --> 20:45.980]  chemistry of aloe vera to quickly penetrate and nourish the skin while delivering the

[22:28.700 --> 22:33.360]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson. Have you ever wondered why banks, stock workers, investment advisors
[22:33.360 --> 22:38.200]  won't talk about gold IRAs? They've been available since 1986, yet the financial industry

[24:16.720 --> 24:22.040]  the reason I talk so much about energy. The reason the United States has been so incredibly
[24:22.040 --> 24:28.760]  wealthy in the last 100 years is because we've had early energy development.
[24:28.760 --> 24:32.600]  We're not even that particularly energy rich compared to some areas, but we had early energy
[24:32.600 --> 24:38.360]  development and we developed an early infrastructure. But have you noticed the last 30, 40 years,
[24:38.360 --> 24:43.720]  no real infrastructure improvement except the compact mega cities and that's all official
[24:43.720 --> 24:50.640]  UN policy. And the globalist made the deal to put Mao Zedong in in 1945. That's now been
[24:50.640 --> 24:56.320]  publicly declassified. Kudos to the John Birch Society exposing that in the 50s and 60s.
[24:56.320 --> 25:01.020]  And then people like, yeah, right, our government put the red Chinese in. They did. They put
[25:01.020 --> 25:06.440]  Mao in, the greatest mass murderer in history who's now in Department of Education, children
[25:06.440 --> 25:11.760]  textbooks for eight year olds. That came out last week. Be like endorsing Hitler or something,
[25:11.760 --> 25:13.660]  but he even killed more than Hitler.
[25:13.660 --> 25:18.740]  And CJ, to show how informed my crew is, he goes, didn't they kill the Keystone Pipeline?
[25:18.740 --> 25:23.680]  Because that would have brought oil to the United States and mainly to Koch brother refineries
[25:23.680 --> 25:29.160]  in Texas, in South Texas on the coast. And I said, bingo, that's absolutely true. And
[25:29.160 --> 25:36.060]  again, I don't have any interest. They don't pay me. I happen to know my power prices have
[25:36.060 --> 25:42.680]  doubled just on electricity in Central Texas in the last five years.
[25:42.680 --> 25:48.000]  And it's in the newspaper that they've doubled because they shut down the two city owned
[25:48.000 --> 25:53.720]  power plants. The third one in Fayetteville is now to be shut down next year. They're
[25:53.720 --> 25:59.280]  just shutting it down. A giant clean burning power plant. The media shows the smoke coming
[25:59.280 --> 26:03.780]  out of it. It's water vapor. That's why it doesn't keep going. It's hot water and carbon
[26:03.780 --> 26:05.840]  dioxide and then it fades down.
[26:05.840 --> 26:09.480]  And you could say, well, that's still dirty. It still has byproducts that they used in
[26:09.480 --> 26:14.460]  steel and plastics and other products. It has a lot of distillates. And you notice the
[26:14.460 --> 26:20.520]  Koch brothers were really smart because the founder of it was a genius engineer, the father
[26:20.520 --> 26:27.220]  of the brothers who developed all these distillation programs in the 40s and 50s.
[26:27.220 --> 26:32.240]  And he had all these patents and it was a genius who learned how to use all this stuff.
[26:32.240 --> 26:36.400]  So more I'd study the Koch brothers, I was just describing it. It's like they're the
[26:36.400 --> 26:43.560]  engine. In episode four and the Star Destroyer is chasing the diplomatic frigate and they're
[26:43.560 --> 26:47.860]  firing on it and they blow the engine and they tractor beam it in. They blow the engine
[26:47.860 --> 26:49.760]  in this country, which they've basically done.
[26:49.760 --> 26:54.320]  It's smoking right now. Then it's gonna totally implode the globalists are gonna buy everything
[26:54.320 --> 26:59.360]  up for pennies on the dollar. Our engine is basically already blown. I mean, they knew
[26:59.360 --> 27:03.600]  when, and it's just, again, I said I'd get into all this other news, but I'm gonna shoot
[27:03.600 --> 27:06.480]  a special report on this.
[27:06.480 --> 27:11.840]  Enemy bombers couldn't do what Obama's done. 200 plus coal power plants, most of them brand
[27:11.840 --> 27:17.960]  new manufacturer, totally clean, shut down in four years. Now they're set to shut down
[27:17.960 --> 27:26.740]  1,000 more. And the public doesn't know why they get their power bill. I mean, my power
[27:26.740 --> 27:31.320]  bill used to be like $300 a month, now it's like 1,500.
[27:31.320 --> 27:39.340]  I mean, that's more than double. I'm in a smaller house and it's more, and it's destroying
[27:39.340 --> 27:43.500]  everybody. And they've got all these electric car people that get all the front parking
[27:43.500 --> 27:47.880]  spaces now, at the grocery stores and things cuz they're even better than the handicap
[27:47.880 --> 27:48.880]  folks.
[27:48.880 --> 27:52.860]  And the idiots that come and plug in, they've done studies. It takes more fossil fuel to
[27:52.860 --> 27:58.280]  charge your car, to generate it, to create the power plants, to transfer it then to your
[27:58.280 --> 28:05.860]  car than it does to use oil. And so they've shut down our coal power plants. They're set
[28:05.860 --> 28:11.640]  to shut down, many fold that, and my interest is I'm watching my power price go up.
[28:11.640 --> 28:19.840]  And remember, here's the thing about the Keystone pipeline, America would have gotten that oil,
[28:19.840 --> 28:24.760]  the United States. Instead, even Bloomberg has to admit this, you can pull it up. Soros
[28:24.760 --> 28:29.400]  is the big winner, who owns the controlling interest in the big railway that is gonna
[28:29.400 --> 28:35.120]  take all the tar sand oil to the west coast of Canada to be loaded on tankers and taken
[28:35.120 --> 28:37.080]  to China.
[28:37.080 --> 28:41.280]  And where is Soros mainly invested? China. Where is Maurice Strong? Where is David Rockefeller?
[28:41.280 --> 28:47.040]  They went to China, set them up, publicly opened them up in the mid 70s, and have moved
[28:47.040 --> 28:51.080]  all industry there with suicide nets. But notice, you'll never hear the left criticize
[28:51.080 --> 28:56.560]  Al Gore for wanting maximum profits out of Apple with Foxconn, where they're now just
[28:56.560 --> 28:59.000]  replacing the humans with robots altogether.
[28:59.000 --> 29:03.960]  They work them 18 hours a day. They're drugging them now. They have forced abortion, abortuary
[29:03.960 --> 29:10.760]  in the factory. Yeah, there's Forbes breaking it down. And you've got TransCanada, and you've
[29:10.760 --> 29:24.680]  got the big railway company shutting down the pipeline to America. And you can see Mother
[29:24.680 --> 29:29.080]  Jones and everybody celebrating, ding dong, the cokes are dead, the cokes, cokes, cokes,
[29:29.080 --> 29:36.600]  they won't get the oil that Communist Chinese will. And it's not even the people getting
[29:36.600 --> 29:44.000]  it. They get the oil. Yeah, Berkshire Hathaway. Yeah, don't forget not just George Soros,
[29:44.000 --> 29:48.640]  but Warren Buffett, holy Toledo. We'll be right back. That's what it's all about, shutting
[29:48.640 --> 29:49.640]  down America.
[29:49.640 --> 30:01.400]  We're on the march. The Empire's on the run. Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network. Devastating

[33:05.580 --> 33:11.660]  center in the heart of the resistance. You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[33:11.660 --> 33:32.620]  You see, the globalist will create irrational fears in people over things that aren't really
[33:32.620 --> 33:40.140]  dangerous or overall bad, like citizens being armed. My gosh, the idea of other citizens
[33:40.140 --> 33:45.220]  being armed is so frightening. But historically, you should be concerned and frightened of
[33:45.220 --> 33:50.860]  a government that's armed to the teeth and engaged in domestic military operations, which
[33:50.860 --> 33:56.500]  is now happening. The Department of Homeland Security is a fifth branch of the military,
[33:56.500 --> 34:00.020]  beholden only to the president, not to Congress.
[34:00.020 --> 34:05.280]  And Congress is told you will not see our DHS plans for civil unrest. You will not see
[34:05.280 --> 34:10.760]  the DHS plans on the billions of bullets. You will not see the Pentagon plans for military
[34:10.760 --> 34:16.500]  operations around the world. You are on the Armed Services Committee, you are on the Intelligence
[34:16.500 --> 34:22.340]  Committee, you hold the power of the purse, you declare the war, the president then executes.
[34:22.340 --> 34:28.740]  We're telling you that's all done. The office of the president is becoming a dictator because
[34:28.740 --> 34:34.580]  the office of the president is a corporate front position. One guy they've got to buy
[34:34.580 --> 34:37.860]  instead of 500 plus in Congress.
[34:37.860 --> 34:42.820]  One guy who can sit there and checkmate Congress and checkmate the states and checkmate the
[34:42.820 --> 34:50.420]  courts and checkmate it all. And that's what's happening. Foreign globalist interest exempt
[34:50.420 --> 34:56.060]  from taxation worldwide, Warren Buffett. Raise taxes on rich people, I've got too much money
[34:56.060 --> 35:01.420]  using class envy when he's exempt from the taxes offshore. I love you, I want you to
[35:01.420 --> 35:06.300]  do well, I'm Warren Buffett. That's why I lobbied and spent tens of millions of dollars
[35:06.300 --> 35:11.340]  per year in the last decade to block the construction of the Keystone Pipeline.
[35:11.340 --> 35:16.320]  And even though you got it built, you're not gonna get that oil in America. It's gonna
[35:16.320 --> 35:23.700]  go from me and George Soros to China, where we're invested. So they're going down, imagine
[35:23.700 --> 35:29.700]  America as a breaker box. They're turning the breakers off. And it's very painful to
[35:29.700 --> 35:35.300]  see people, family, veterans, people I've known my whole life don't have money to drive
[35:35.300 --> 35:37.300]  to work now.
[35:37.300 --> 35:43.280]  To see restaurants closing, businesses closing, roads rotting. But more cops, you can't swing
[35:43.280 --> 35:48.620]  a dead cat and not county, city, state, federal, armored vehicles, helicopters, checkpoints.
[35:48.620 --> 35:56.260]  Yes, the signs of tyranny. As they just flip the switch, boom, boom, just grabbing the
[35:56.260 --> 36:03.780]  switch, boom, boom, boom. Just turning the lights out of America. It's like going down
[36:03.780 --> 36:08.460]  the life support, flipping off the switches, click, click, click, click, click, click,
[36:08.460 --> 36:09.460]  click, click.
[36:09.460 --> 36:13.060]  And then I hear, Koch brothers, demons, Koch brothers, the devil. Koch brothers, there's
[36:13.060 --> 36:17.940]  no one worse, why they flayed children alive. Alex Jones works for them. And I go, let me
[36:17.940 --> 36:21.820]  go check these guys out. Let me make sure I know more than most people being politically
[36:21.820 --> 36:22.820]  aware.
[36:22.820 --> 36:26.580]  Let me go make sure I know about these guys. So I spent the last few weeks, and I've got
[36:26.580 --> 36:29.580]  Aaron looking into them right now. We're gonna do a whole report on the good, the bad, and
[36:29.580 --> 36:34.500]  the ugly, the Koch brothers. But then I come to the industrial fact that they are all that's
[36:34.500 --> 36:36.340]  left of the engine of America.
[36:36.340 --> 36:41.880]  And don't worry, so-called left authoritarians, that engine's gonna get blown. I can see where
[36:41.880 --> 36:48.180]  everything's going. You're gonna shut everything down, okay? Don't worry, you'll defeat the
[36:48.180 --> 36:53.740]  Koch brothers, you'll destroy them. Don't worry, you didn't get that pipeline, China
[36:53.740 --> 36:57.460]  gets it, okay?
[36:57.460 --> 37:02.140]  Don't worry, don't worry, and go get your college education, which there's going to
[37:02.140 --> 37:08.540]  be no jobs for unless it's in Homeland Security. And by the way, the government wouldn't hurt
[37:08.540 --> 37:13.600]  us, roll your sleeve up and take all the vaccines. Sure, there's thousands of admitted lethal
[37:13.600 --> 37:18.320]  secret tests that have been declassified on foster kids and US military personnel and
[37:18.320 --> 37:19.900]  black people.
[37:19.900 --> 37:24.540]  Even a few years ago, testing pesticides on black kids, foster kids taken by CPS in New
[37:24.540 --> 37:31.260]  York until they die. I mean, we need to turn our guns into a government like that, okay?
[37:31.260 --> 37:37.260]  So man, let me tell you, I'm not worried about Foxconn and Apple with suicide nets and forced
[37:37.260 --> 37:43.100]  abortions, okay? I mean, let me tell you, that's a good thing, that's liberal. But let
[37:43.100 --> 37:48.480]  me tell you, what is bad? The Koch brothers, ladies and gentlemen, lobby and give money
[37:48.480 --> 37:50.260]  to pro-Second Amendment causes.
[37:50.260 --> 37:56.260]  Yesterday, I spent a couple hours listening to the secret recordings leaked from a 2011
[37:56.260 --> 38:00.000]  meeting. The Brad blog, I ought to get him on. I've had the guy on actually before on
[38:00.000 --> 38:02.620]  election Friday, he's a pretty good guy, but I ought to have him on and go, yeah, Brad,
[38:02.620 --> 38:05.420]  this is terrible. Let's play some of these clips, we gotta protect the family?
[38:05.420 --> 38:12.840]  I mean, I'm glad I investigated cuz I supposedly work for him. Oh my gosh, speaker after speaker,
[38:12.840 --> 38:17.980]  we gotta defend private property and the new wealth that is the engine and not let the
[38:17.980 --> 38:21.980]  crony capitalists take over? I mean, look at that evil Fed chief in Dallas, Federal
[38:21.980 --> 38:24.520]  Reserve head of the Dallas Federal Reserve.
[38:24.520 --> 38:28.840]  That's the, well, let's show him Reuters, says crony capitalists have taken over and
[38:28.840 --> 38:34.460]  are gonna shut down their competition. Arrest him, he's bad too. See, when the Koch brothers
[38:34.460 --> 38:37.940]  do a few good things, I'm not saying they're perfect cuz I'm doing deep research on them,
[38:37.940 --> 38:42.420]  I'm finding some stuff, obviously.
[38:42.420 --> 38:46.240]  And when the Dallas Fed, I mean, I had Dr. Paul Roberts on Friday, I said, are they doing
[38:46.240 --> 38:49.520]  that cuz they know things are about to implode and they don't wanna be blamed? And Roberts
[38:49.520 --> 38:51.860]  is like, no, they realize America's finished.
[38:51.860 --> 38:56.480]  And there's Fed's Fisher, too big to fail banks or crony capitalists, Reuters. I guess
[38:56.480 --> 39:01.460]  he's bad. You know what, and they're actually attacking him. He's the bad guy cuz he's telling
[39:01.460 --> 39:06.460]  the truth. See, I'm starting to figure this out. When sane people, even in the power structure,
[39:06.460 --> 39:08.340]  go you know what?
[39:08.340 --> 39:13.280]  There's these offshore mega banks that are so powerful. How about the Koch brothers collectively
[39:13.280 --> 39:19.680]  with like 40 something billion bucks? And I mean, literally, thousands of factories
[39:19.680 --> 39:25.480]  in the US. You know, the globalist that came out, AP did a lawsuit back in 2000, got documents
[39:25.480 --> 39:28.420]  where the Big Ten oil companies met.
[39:28.420 --> 39:32.000]  And you can look these up, I've done reports on them, but just look them up. And it met
[39:32.000 --> 39:36.760]  in 95 and 96 to create an artificial scarcity in oil. And they tried to buy up all of the
[39:36.760 --> 39:42.040]  privately owned refineries or have regulators shut them down to create an artificial bottleneck
[39:42.040 --> 39:43.040]  to rape you.
[39:43.040 --> 39:48.280]  That's big oil, Queen Beatrix, Queen of England who owned Dutch Royal Shell, British Petroleum.
[39:48.280 --> 39:56.000]  They even tell you they own them, Dutch Royal Shell, BP, British Petroleum. And then you
[39:56.000 --> 40:02.580]  find out, they hired the regulators to go try to shut down all the Koch brother refineries
[40:02.580 --> 40:06.920]  in Louisiana, Mississippi and Texas that supply the whole Midwest and East Coast.
[40:06.920 --> 40:12.800]  And then I just spent hours looking at it, this economic warfare where trillionaires
[40:12.800 --> 40:17.060]  are trying to blow the engine of the US. And the Koch brothers would not shut down their
[40:17.060 --> 40:24.640]  refineries the last 15 years. But don't worry, they're losing now, they'll be shut down soon.
[40:24.640 --> 40:30.680]  And you're like, good, I'll have an electric car. No, no, no, they're shutting the coal
[40:30.680 --> 40:34.860]  plants down too that create the electricity, 52% of our power.
[40:34.860 --> 40:41.240]  They're shutting everything down right now. I mean, you people that support this are our
[40:41.240 --> 40:50.200]  self-destructive idiots. I mean, I am just, see, I said I was getting all this other news.
[40:50.200 --> 40:57.080]  It's just so frustrating to watch us being powered down and to know how horrible it is.
[40:57.080 --> 41:01.880]  And to know we've gone from 20 million on food stamps to 50 million. And to know that
[41:01.880 --> 41:12.480]  this is all happening and just wanna stop it. What's that Three Doors Down song, Dynamite?
[41:12.480 --> 41:16.560]  We're gonna play that coming in the next segment cuz that's how I feel.
[41:16.560 --> 41:21.680]  Kryptonite, yeah, that's it. I always get the names of things wrong, obviously Kryptonite.
[41:21.680 --> 41:28.760]  See if you can find that, play it coming in because, I mean, the general public sleepwalking.
[41:28.760 --> 41:33.440]  And I'm sitting here watching them being abused and mega bank trillionaires shutting everything
[41:33.440 --> 41:40.480]  down with mass suicide factories and suicide nets and five million robots ordered, one
[41:40.480 --> 41:42.840]  million already delivered to replace humans.
[41:42.840 --> 41:48.540]  Running around saying how they're gonna kill us and they're the liberals. They're the humanitarians
[41:48.540 --> 41:54.960]  cuz the television said so. And then there's some private family that had hundreds of patents
[41:54.960 --> 41:58.920]  their father developed. So they independently kind of in that last window made their own
[41:58.920 --> 42:00.640]  money.
[42:00.640 --> 42:07.760]  Steel plants, aluminum plants, fertilizer plants, paper plants, plastic plants, distillates,
[42:07.760 --> 42:13.060]  just thousands of factories. I started realizing just every factory I drive around, half of
[42:13.060 --> 42:21.760]  them are Koch brothers or Koch carbon, their other brother. And I just see all this happening.
[42:21.760 --> 42:25.020]  And you know what? I agree with you. I agree with Mother Jones and Media Matters run by
[42:25.020 --> 42:29.840]  the White House, all of them. Arrest them, shut them down, shut every coal power plant
[42:29.840 --> 42:30.840]  down.
[42:30.840 --> 42:34.520]  I'm gonna give you what you want here. Shut every coal plant down, shut down all the oil
[42:34.520 --> 42:39.640]  pipelines, shut everything down. But see it won't be done quickly where you notice it's
[42:39.640 --> 42:45.600]  ruining you. It'll be done real slow creeping financial death. So you'll be cheering it
[42:45.600 --> 42:51.920]  the whole way while it happens. There won't be a quick death to the American economy.
[42:51.920 --> 42:56.220]  While the globalists move everything to China and it doesn't even empower the Chinese, they're
[42:56.220 --> 43:01.860]  being used to have the race to the bottom to leverage everything down to absolute zero.
[43:01.860 --> 43:06.880]  Because when they fall as total slaves, the rest of the world will be sucked down by it.
[43:06.880 --> 43:11.960]  Sucked down in that competition, that false fraudulent. It's like a football game where
[43:11.960 --> 43:16.120]  you're playing against the other team on a 90 degree angle. And they get to kick off
[43:16.120 --> 43:21.000]  from a mountain on top of you and each time, even if you try to run a touchdown, you never
[43:21.000 --> 43:22.760]  get to go from the top.
[43:22.760 --> 43:27.720]  You're always going uphill and ignorance absolutely reigns. What did a Pulitzer Prize winner Chris
[43:27.720 --> 43:33.120]  Hedges say about it? We now live in a nation where doctors destroy health, lawyers destroy
[43:33.120 --> 43:38.640]  justice, universities destroy knowledge, governments destroy freedom, the press destroys information,
[43:38.640 --> 43:47.040]  religion destroys morals, and our banks destroy the economy, Chris Hedges.
[43:47.040 --> 43:54.160]  And the United Nations in the New York Times, they admit, in Africa and Latin America and
[43:54.160 --> 44:00.360]  Asia, in Burma, was the first time I saw a report of this about 15 years ago. It was
[44:00.360 --> 44:05.120]  even in the National Geographic magazine. They were saying it was good, so I went and
[44:05.120 --> 44:09.000]  looked it up on kind of the proto web that it is today.
[44:09.000 --> 44:18.120]  It was about 99 actually, so 14 years ago. And it talked about how the UN exterminated
[44:18.120 --> 44:23.560]  thousands of the population to make it a UN biosphere. They go in and actually shoot the
[44:23.560 --> 44:30.880]  people. Like you go in and kill a group of invasive elephants that go into farming belts
[44:30.880 --> 44:36.640]  in Africa, they do that. And it described the culling of the wild humans.
[44:36.640 --> 44:43.960]  And then these environmentalists back and go, well, it's got to be done. I have 15 jets.
[44:43.960 --> 44:47.360]  I love the Queen of England. Prince Charles came out and said you shouldn't take a hot
[44:47.360 --> 44:52.320]  shower because of the carbon footprint. They have over 100 giant palaces. Some of them
[44:52.320 --> 44:54.240]  have thousands of rooms.
[44:54.240 --> 44:58.920]  Some of the palaces are over 100 square miles, not the palace itself, but the grounds of
[44:58.920 --> 45:08.240]  them. Each member has their own private train, private jet copters. Last time I checked,
[45:08.240 --> 45:15.880]  Prince Charles had more than 20 aircraft and flies them himself. And they get several billion
[45:15.880 --> 45:20.760]  pounds a year just to pay for their gas allowance to heat the palaces.
[45:20.760 --> 45:27.400]  I'm gonna say that again. Rothchilds have palaces everywhere, same deal. And they're
[45:27.400 --> 45:33.560]  all saying you are using too much. You can't have plastic bags, blah, blah, blah, blah,
[45:33.560 --> 45:39.280]  blah, blah, while they conspicuously, you wanna talk about class envy, you've got one
[45:39.280 --> 45:44.800]  tenth of 1%. We did the math, what was it? One out of some impossible number.
[45:44.800 --> 45:55.560]  What is 600 top gophers, 6,000 minion gophers in the super class booked by Rothkopp and
[45:55.560 --> 46:01.400]  less than 20 families? Less than 20 families have more than 80% of the world's wealth.
[46:01.400 --> 46:03.820]  By the way, when the US had the biggest middle class in the world, they only had about half
[46:03.820 --> 46:05.640]  of it just a few decades ago.
[46:05.640 --> 46:09.840]  There it's the ultra rich are the ones, man. They're like, I don't own those power plants,
[46:09.840 --> 46:13.480]  shut them down. I don't own those ships, shut them down. I don't own those factories, shut
[46:13.480 --> 46:19.320]  them down, move them to China. Well, you gotta go to the Chinese Politburo and the generals
[46:19.320 --> 46:22.660]  who are all billionaires now, live in literal palaces.
[46:22.660 --> 46:27.320]  And the people are used like slaves while they build the robots to replace us. Robots
[46:27.320 --> 46:31.520]  that work on robots. I mean, do you understand how frustrated I am? And then the boogeyman
[46:31.520 --> 46:37.060]  of the incredible authoritarian, I tell you what. If we're gonna arrest rich people just
[46:37.060 --> 46:42.000]  cuz they're rich, let's start with the Queen of England, the Rothchilds, the Rockefeller's,
[46:42.000 --> 46:45.440]  Ted Turner, Bill Gates, all of them.
[46:45.440 --> 46:49.600]  And then after you've arrested all of them, we can arrest the Koch brothers. If you've
[46:49.600 --> 46:55.460]  got like this Soviet dream of you're in a Che Guevara outfit and storming the Bastille,
[46:55.460 --> 46:58.360]  you're a Jacobin, so you don't know what that is. You should actually find out before you
[46:58.360 --> 46:59.360]  fantasize.
[46:59.360 --> 47:07.700]  I want a t-shirt simple for you, isn't it? They're shutting it all down. And by the way,
[47:07.700 --> 47:10.700]  they're not shutting it down to bankrupt it and take it over, turn it back on. They're
[47:10.700 --> 47:15.120]  not going to turn it back on. Do you understand that? They're not going to turn any of it
[47:15.120 --> 47:16.120]  back on.
[47:16.120 --> 47:20.760]  And you're gonna laugh now, a lot of you, but you won't be laughing soon. You won't
[47:20.760 --> 47:27.080]  be laughing soon. And all the arrogant police, I can't believe Art Acevedo, our Austin police
[47:27.080 --> 47:30.740]  chief, the only Texas police chief they could get to go to DC and call for a shutdown of
[47:30.740 --> 47:32.180]  private sales of guns.
[47:32.180 --> 47:37.440]  That means you can't transfer guns when you die. You can't give family a gun. Felonies,
[47:37.440 --> 47:41.680]  and they will start arresting everybody. Where'd you get that gun? Prove your history. And
[47:41.680 --> 47:48.640]  felonies for over seven round mags, he wants those banned. And felonies, they already ran
[47:48.640 --> 47:53.040]  a fake sting with the ATF trying to shut down Austin gun shows.
[47:53.040 --> 47:56.600]  And I said he's an authoritarian. He said, how dare you? I wanna go on your show for
[47:56.600 --> 48:00.880]  saying I'm a commie or an authoritarian, cuz he came from Cuba. And you know what? Why
[48:00.880 --> 48:05.840]  don't you go back to Cuba? In fact, the headline ought to be, Art Acevedo moving back to Cuba.
[48:05.840 --> 48:09.120]  And he'll probably get real mad about that. But the point is, is that I guess you're trying
[48:09.120 --> 48:15.560]  to turn America into Cuba, so you can go work for the Justice Department.
[48:15.560 --> 48:19.840]  When Art, you know the crime rates dropped 49% nationwide in violent crime because of
[48:19.840 --> 48:25.200]  armament of the citizens, the criminals are scared to death since 1991. The gun ownership
[48:25.200 --> 48:29.800]  graph goes straight up, and the crime rate going down goes straight down. It's an X on
[48:29.800 --> 48:32.120]  the graph, guns go up, crimes go down.
[48:32.120 --> 48:40.040]  And you know that, but you wanna toady up there. I've got his testimony. APD chief pushes
[48:40.040 --> 48:44.520]  for tighter gun control, here it is. Unbelievable that this is what our country-
[48:44.520 --> 48:48.760]  Austin police chief, Art Acevedo, is taking part in the ongoing national debate over gun
[48:48.760 --> 48:54.000]  control. He made the trek to Washington yesterday. He tweeted out this photo yesterday afternoon.
[48:54.000 --> 49:00.560]  Acevedo testified at a house hearing in favor of universal background checks for gun purchases.
[49:00.560 --> 49:06.760]  The universal background check is a first and essential step toward comprehensive reform
[49:06.760 --> 49:09.960]  of our firearms and gun laws. First step to confiscation.
[49:09.960 --> 49:15.960]  Without this essential element, there can be no lasting impact on gun violence.
[49:15.960 --> 49:19.840]  Right now, all licensed dealers have to submit potential buyers to a background check, but
[49:19.840 --> 49:25.800]  that law does not apply to private sellers and person-to-person transactions at gun shows.
[49:25.800 --> 49:37.360]  Yeah, really what it is is a registration program. That's what it is. It is a registration
[49:37.360 --> 49:45.280]  program against the American people, period. And you heard him, it's an important first
[49:45.280 --> 49:50.080]  step. He's showing, hey, I know the plan, guys, promote me up to federal level.
[49:50.080 --> 49:55.640]  He's all speaking code. And Art Acevedo has put his arm around me. He's sworn he's a patriot.
[49:55.640 --> 49:58.520]  He's promised there'll never be troops in Austin on the streets. There's now troops
[49:58.520 --> 50:03.040]  all the time running checkpoints and put in all sorts of crowd control in Austin.
[50:03.040 --> 50:11.040]  There's now TSA checkpoints downtown. And there you go, buddy. You are un-American,
[50:11.040 --> 50:15.780]  just like all the other enemies of this country, period. And the entire Austin police force,
[50:15.780 --> 50:19.560]  you either speak out against this, but you won't, because your higher ups are all politicians
[50:19.560 --> 50:24.040]  too. And don't worry, they're gonna shut your power plants down, shut your future down.
[50:24.040 --> 50:28.600]  Cops, hope you look at your kids, cuz they have no future.
[50:28.600 --> 50:31.440]  You know, I ran into the cop that was threatening to arrest me at the Austin airport. I was
[50:31.440 --> 50:36.720]  in an Italian restaurant by the movie theater. And I see the guy walk in and he sees me.
[50:36.720 --> 50:40.240]  And he turns and walks over to the bar with his wife where they were gonna eat. And I
[50:40.240 --> 50:43.360]  came over and first he's like, we're fine, we're fine. Kinda leave me alone. And then
[50:43.360 --> 50:45.320]  later he looks over and goes, hey, how you doing?
[50:45.320 --> 50:50.360]  After I think you got the first shock of seeing me. But the whole point is, he was going to
[50:50.360 --> 50:55.680]  see Olympus falling, which again is total fantasy about how terrorists are under every
[50:55.680 --> 51:01.360]  table. Hey cops, the real terrorists are the globalists, they're destroying America.
[51:01.360 --> 51:05.140]  If you're listening, you'd know your basic freedoms are being threatened every day. If
[51:05.140 --> 51:09.340]  you're listening, you'd know the economy is not getting better. You know gas and food

[52:59.520 --> 53:04.640]  water. Hey there, my name is Frank Bates. Do you know the number one most valuable item
[53:04.640 --> 53:09.880]  in a crisis? Some people think the answer is gold, others think it's a gun, but the
[53:09.880 --> 53:16.400]  correct answer will shock you. I just created a free video at Crisis123.com that reveals
[53:16.400 --> 53:22.720]  a surprising item that is more valuable than gold in a crisis. 97% of Americans don't have
[53:22.720 --> 53:27.280]  this one critical item. In fact, they haven't even given it a thought. And the sad truth
[53:27.280 --> 53:32.520]  is that you may not survive without it when a real crisis hits and a starving mob is right
[53:32.520 --> 53:36.320]  outside your door. What I have to tell you could literally make the difference between
[53:36.320 --> 53:42.480]  life and death for you and your family. Watch my video at Crisis123.com to discover the
[53:42.480 --> 53:47.800]  number one most valuable item in a crisis. You'll be shocked. See the controversial video
[53:47.800 --> 53:51.740]  that thousands of other smart patriots have already seen in the last three months. Go
[53:51.740 --> 53:57.920]  watch my video now at Crisis123.com before they force me to shut it down. Again, that's
[53:57.920 --> 54:12.360]  Crisis123.com. That's right. Our founding fathers battle the tyrants from the grave
[54:12.360 --> 54:18.480]  with the bill of rights and constitution that they enshrined for us. Here's the deal. Real
[54:18.480 --> 54:23.960]  tyrants are taken over and I gotta be honest with you. I, um, and I've had the awesome
[54:23.960 --> 54:27.440]  police chief on four or five times over the years. He's a charming guy. I wanted to believe
[54:27.440 --> 54:33.160]  he wasn't, uh, you know, a wicked gun grabber, but, uh, they're putting out this hoax that
[54:33.160 --> 54:38.720]  guns are discredited and guns cause crime and anybody that tries to disarm the American
[54:38.720 --> 54:43.200]  people is part of the occupying collaborator system.
[54:43.200 --> 54:46.800]  And so I want everybody to get this video of this, this live broadcast, but there's
[54:46.800 --> 54:51.000]  video of it. That'll be posted at prison, planet.tv and on YouTube and send it to art
[54:51.000 --> 54:55.200]  a Cevita art. If you think the citizens not having guns, this goes for the rest of the
[54:55.200 --> 55:01.280]  police chiefs that work for the foreign banks one way or another. If you think that guns
[55:01.280 --> 55:06.680]  are so evil in the city, in, in citizen's hands, you should move back to Cuba.
[55:06.680 --> 55:10.340]  You should move to North Korea. You should move to communist China where they got mobile
[55:10.340 --> 55:16.960]  execution vans. How dare you come to America and flee tyranny and try to put it on me and
[55:16.960 --> 55:24.960]  my family. And I take it real personal cause I know you. I take it real personal. I get
[55:24.960 --> 55:28.920]  sick when I see all these police chiefs up there. I'm going to roll some video for radio
[55:28.920 --> 55:34.220]  listeners will post it up at info wars.com, but here's fbi.gov and the crime statistics
[55:34.220 --> 55:43.840]  from 1991 to 2011, the latest numbers, a 49% drop in violent crime nationwide on average.
[55:43.840 --> 55:48.680]  And you can look at the graph of gun ownership. It, it, it goes up. The crime goes down. You
[55:48.680 --> 55:55.320]  know that, you know, within one year of Texas having concealed carry violent home invasions,
[55:55.320 --> 56:00.760]  carjackings, and other aggravated assaults went down by more than 30%. You know, more
[56:00.760 --> 56:05.200]  than 25% in Florida, and you know, the same similar number in every stinking state in
[56:05.200 --> 56:06.200]  this country.
[56:06.200 --> 56:10.120]  And I am sick of you and your hoax. You want our guns because the globalists are getting
[56:10.120 --> 56:13.720]  ready to implode this country. And you want us to be like people in Mexico who had their
[56:13.720 --> 56:22.860]  guns taken a hundred years ago and who have been slaves ever since. Mexico has a total
[56:22.860 --> 56:30.040]  ban on citizen guns and they have the highest gun crime rate in the world. There's your
[56:30.040 --> 56:33.500]  message R.D. Cevita, go ahead and go get your justice department job.
[56:33.500 --> 56:36.200]  Maybe you'll really show off for them. Maybe you'll go to the justice department, be like
[56:36.200 --> 56:41.760]  Eric Holder, who was involved in Oklahoma City. Maybe you'll go there and teach us how
[56:41.760 --> 56:45.800]  to ship guns into Mexico to kill thousands of innocent people. So you can blame it. Maybe
[56:45.800 --> 56:49.480]  you'll show the justice department what a good collaborator you are.
[56:49.480 --> 56:53.880]  Why don't you go back to Cuba and go apologize to Fidel Castro, who's killed hundreds of
[56:53.880 --> 56:59.000]  thousands of his own people after taking their guns. Why don't you go, Comrade Fidel, I love
[56:59.000 --> 57:04.800]  you. I love what you do. I wanna take the guns from America. Why don't you come to America
[57:04.800 --> 57:07.800]  Fidel and help us run everything there?
[57:07.800 --> 57:14.000]  We will take the guns, Fidel. I will prove to you, Comrade, what we will do to them,
[57:14.000 --> 57:20.920]  yeah. I'm supposed to just go, my police chief says, put felony if I have over a seven
[57:20.920 --> 57:26.400]  round mag. He says shut down the gun show. I can't give my dad a gun. He can't give me
[57:26.400 --> 57:30.400]  a gun. My dad tried to give me a BB gun last night.
[57:30.400 --> 57:34.680]  We were over at the house shooting at his house, kids were having fun. One of those
[57:34.680 --> 57:43.600]  Crossman revolver gas powered ones, CO2, evil CO2. He tried to give it to me and I said no.
[57:43.600 --> 57:49.200]  Some cities have laws where BB guns are banned, felonies for that. I'm sick of it. I'm tired
[57:49.200 --> 57:52.840]  of the criminal government. The government's parasitic, out of control. I got an idea.
[57:52.840 --> 57:57.520]  How about the government turns their guns in? 2 billion plus rounds of ammo, thousands
[57:57.520 --> 58:02.560]  and thousands of giant armored vehicles, all the militarization. And saying now, Homeland
[58:02.560 --> 58:07.760]  Security's for gun owners, returning veterans, libertarians, the rest of us.
[58:07.760 --> 58:11.280]  Because we stand in the way of the destruction of this country. And anybody that does is
[58:11.280 --> 58:16.800]  demonized. You're gonna see people join Soron. You're gonna see people join Mordor. You're
[58:16.800 --> 58:21.840]  gonna see people join the New World Order. I am not one of these people. And when we
[58:21.840 --> 58:26.480]  come back, Joel Scowles is coming up, but I haven't even gotten into the bombshell news.
[58:26.480 --> 58:32.120]  40% of the bank accounts to be loaded, 40% now. Yeah, and it's gonna spread everywhere.
[58:32.120 --> 58:37.400]  And we've also got hundreds of millions of rounds of more ammo, hollow points for you
[58:37.400 --> 58:45.320]  and your family, DHS just bought. Take the government's guns. Gun control for the tyrant
[58:45.320 --> 58:50.600]  government. No standing army in America, Constitution.

[01:00:49.960 --> 01:00:55.200]  A couple days before he was on with us a week and a half ago, he survived an incredible
[01:00:55.200 --> 01:01:02.440]  plane crash that we have video of for TV viewers watching on prisonplanet.tv. So I want to
[01:01:02.440 --> 01:01:11.920]  challenge all of you who are not members of prisonplanet.tv to become members of Prison
[01:01:11.920 --> 01:01:17.120]  Planet today. So you can actually see the video and all the things that we're covering
[01:01:17.120 --> 01:01:23.180]  here on the broadcast. And of course, last hour I didn't plug any sponsors because I
[01:01:23.180 --> 01:01:25.960]  get so upset about what's happening here in this country.
[01:01:25.960 --> 01:01:30.960]  But it's also very important to go to info war store.com, whether it's Pro Second Amendment

[01:06:02.440 --> 01:06:06.840]  to do a lot of research into why even if I had a pretty good sized meal that I was still
[01:06:06.840 --> 01:06:11.720]  starving and my research led me to a well known fact that most of the soils that we
[01:06:11.720 --> 01:06:16.000]  grow our crops on here in the United States and across the industrialized world are almost
[01:06:16.000 --> 01:06:21.560]  completely depleted of almost all of the key minerals and trace elements that our bodies
[01:06:21.560 --> 01:06:27.320]  need to rebuild themselves, fight off cancer and be healthy. I then searched out the best
[01:06:27.320 --> 01:06:32.880]  vitamin and mineral company out there and discovered Younggevity. The Younggevity products
[01:06:32.880 --> 01:06:37.440]  are designed to give you the real nutrition you need and once you've got that, you don't

[01:08:21.600 --> 01:08:28.960]  Welcome, my friends, to the second hour of the worldwide broadcast. It is Monday, the
[01:08:28.960 --> 01:08:36.920]  25th day of March, 2013. It was almost about a week and a half ago, Joel Skalzen of World
[01:08:36.920 --> 01:08:42.440]  Affairs Brief is gonna be joining us. He didn't tell me a day and a half before he was on.
[01:08:42.440 --> 01:08:46.880]  He survived an incredible plane crash that was actually local and ended up being covered
[01:08:46.880 --> 01:08:51.240]  by some national news as a miraculous survival.
[01:08:51.240 --> 01:08:57.720]  Same thing with the head of the UK Independence Party, Nigel Farage. He barely survived an
[01:08:57.720 --> 01:09:03.120]  incredible crash, by the grace of God. We're gonna be briefly talking about that and just
[01:09:03.120 --> 01:09:07.600]  the perspective on life and then shifting gears into other geopolitical issues. But
[01:09:07.600 --> 01:09:13.240]  first off, if you just joined us, there's an article by Adan Salazar that was posted
[01:09:13.240 --> 01:09:22.160]  yesterday up at infowars.com and prisonplanet.com, where a retired army captain warns DHS acquisitions
[01:09:22.160 --> 01:09:28.000]  are bold threat of war against the American people. Says Americans may have to prepare
[01:09:28.000 --> 01:09:33.120]  to defend themselves in the US Constitution against the Obama administration's coup against
[01:09:33.120 --> 01:09:34.120]  the American people.
[01:09:34.120 --> 01:09:39.160]  And then he breaks down the armored vehicles, the endoplasty commentatis, and he really
[01:09:39.160 --> 01:09:43.680]  crystallizes it for me. Because it's what the Rand Corporation admits they would do
[01:09:43.680 --> 01:09:49.440]  back in 1998 in a report that I covered on air at the time. Federalized, but that itself
[01:09:49.440 --> 01:09:56.780]  is UN or globalized via the global corporate government. That's three different groups
[01:09:56.780 --> 01:10:00.440]  battling for control on it, but they all support the global government because they all think
[01:10:00.440 --> 01:10:02.800]  they're gonna get control of it.
[01:10:02.800 --> 01:10:08.680]  And he explains in his letter to the US Senator, and it's published up at infowars.com on the
[01:10:08.680 --> 01:10:17.480]  video report I did yesterday. He goes on to explain this is a fifth branch of the military.
[01:10:17.480 --> 01:10:21.240]  It's really even outside of NORTHCOM that it ties into. They're in Colorado Springs
[01:10:21.240 --> 01:10:27.580]  and Denver. It's the shadow government absorbing America. Thousands of armored vehicles, not
[01:10:27.580 --> 01:10:31.920]  just the 2,700 going to different agencies.
[01:10:31.920 --> 01:10:36.280]  Every police department I know has armored vehicles, helicopters. They're getting new
[01:10:36.280 --> 01:10:40.880]  ones. I see the big black armored ones here in Austin that say DHS federal police. We've
[01:10:40.880 --> 01:10:43.640]  done video reports on it.
[01:10:43.640 --> 01:10:51.400]  So we've got all of this happening, all of that unfolding. And you've got state and federal
[01:10:51.400 --> 01:10:57.600]  agencies. You can't swing a dead cat anywhere in the US now without federal task forces,
[01:10:57.600 --> 01:11:05.560]  state task forces, international task forces, zoning cops wearing uniforms.
[01:11:05.560 --> 01:11:13.340]  And they're arming zoning cops in many cities. Just real hardcore tyranny that is all covered
[01:11:13.340 --> 01:11:18.360]  in the United Nations Industrial Development Organization plan from the 50s, 60s, and 70s.
[01:11:18.360 --> 01:11:21.680]  That is the forerunner of agenda 21.
[01:11:21.680 --> 01:11:27.000]  Of real control is about controlling industry and shutting it down so only select groups
[01:11:27.000 --> 01:11:30.920]  at the top of the combine can operate. And they've made deals to transfer everything
[01:11:30.920 --> 01:11:39.600]  to China as a way to leverage and get full political control of us here domestically.
[01:11:39.600 --> 01:11:46.740]  And the good news is this debate is now beginning to really take hold out there about why is
[01:11:46.740 --> 01:11:51.860]  government arming to the teeth domestically and saying gun owners, conservatives, libertarians
[01:11:51.860 --> 01:11:55.240]  are the new number one terror threat as we warned you they would go public with because
[01:11:55.240 --> 01:11:57.580]  that was internal a decade ago.
[01:11:57.580 --> 01:12:00.920]  The fact that they're going public means they're getting ready to go more and more operational.
[01:12:00.920 --> 01:12:05.960]  They've got all the movies, the TV shows with the new bad guys are mainly white gun owners,
[01:12:05.960 --> 01:12:11.200]  conservatives, libertarians who are secretly Taliban, and they've got new movies out.
[01:12:11.200 --> 01:12:16.080]  So they wouldn't be bringing all this out unless they were moving into a hotter phase
[01:12:16.080 --> 01:12:20.920]  with a false flag or something along those lines to politically demonize us.
[01:12:20.920 --> 01:12:25.160]  Because anytime the globalist can't win, they will stage events to blame it on you as a
[01:12:25.160 --> 01:12:32.560]  form of political judo in a self-inflicted inside job operation. And I see all the stars
[01:12:32.560 --> 01:12:35.980]  aligning for that to be done.
[01:12:35.980 --> 01:12:40.960]  But if we have a maximum effort right now to expose this, it may push their timetable
[01:12:40.960 --> 01:12:46.800]  back. Their timetable, Brzezinski says is a decade behind. Joel Skousen is a smart guy
[01:12:46.800 --> 01:12:52.520]  in my summation, says they're about a decade behind. I believe they're about a decade behind.
[01:12:52.520 --> 01:12:56.960]  Don't have the defeatist attitude that we couldn't take America back. It's that foregone
[01:12:56.960 --> 01:12:59.560]  conclusion, that self-fulfilling prophecy.
[01:12:59.560 --> 01:13:03.800]  We should be offensively trying to take America back, but we are up against a powerful array
[01:13:03.800 --> 01:13:08.920]  of forces, as Joel says, while building a defense fallback position. So you gotta be
[01:13:08.920 --> 01:13:15.960]  on offense and defense. But right now, I am myself on full tilt offense because I've already
[01:13:15.960 --> 01:13:17.800]  set up my defense.
[01:13:17.800 --> 01:13:24.240]  Moving out to a country zone is a little safer, food, firearms, friends, family, educated.
[01:13:24.240 --> 01:13:27.760]  But before we go to Joel, here's just a few of these articles today. This is a US News
[01:13:27.760 --> 01:13:34.280]  and World Report. It cites infowars.com. DHS denies massive ammunition purchases. And
[01:13:34.280 --> 01:13:38.120]  when you go and look at what media matters, other White House groups, they just say there
[01:13:38.120 --> 01:13:39.120]  are no bullets, period.
[01:13:39.120 --> 01:13:43.240]  There are no armored vehicles. They actually lie and say, not that we bought a 500 million
[01:13:43.240 --> 01:13:47.540]  this year and are gonna get a couple billion over the next few years. They're just denying
[01:13:47.540 --> 01:13:55.840]  and saying it doesn't exist. Here's the Drudge Report, 360,000 more rounds, another purchase,
[01:13:55.840 --> 01:13:59.560]  and that's an infowars.com article.
[01:13:59.560 --> 01:14:04.680]  And government cover-up of ammo buys implodes. Silent secrecy and shoddy attempts at debunking
[01:14:04.680 --> 01:14:10.800]  the facts have led to congressional inquiry. Now 15 members of Congress getting into that.
[01:14:10.800 --> 01:14:16.280]  And meanwhile, Obama presses Congress to vote on assault weapons ban, banning semi-autos.
[01:14:16.280 --> 01:14:22.500]  He says he's gonna hit the road with a political campaign against guns, which he promised to
[01:14:22.500 --> 01:14:24.560]  not go after four years ago.
[01:14:24.560 --> 01:14:30.240]  Bloomberg has a $14 million ad blitz. It was 12 million, now they've announced it's 14
[01:14:30.240 --> 01:14:35.000]  million last night against the Second Amendment. They're on the offense, folks, because they're
[01:14:35.000 --> 01:14:38.780]  going to stage something or provocateur something to blame the Second Amendment. I could see
[01:14:38.780 --> 01:14:39.780]  all the signs.
[01:14:39.780 --> 01:14:44.820]  I told you that back in November before Sandy Hook, okay? I mean, it's all lined up right
[01:14:44.820 --> 01:14:52.400]  now. DHS, again, ladies and gentlemen, is moving on all fronts right now. And I understand
[01:14:52.400 --> 01:14:56.340]  what Joel says. If we run around like total chickens with our heads cut off, let's just
[01:14:56.340 --> 01:14:57.340]  cover this first.
[01:14:57.340 --> 01:15:02.440]  Then we'll get into your plane crash, which is just miraculous. We have video of it and
[01:15:02.440 --> 01:15:08.080]  more for the TV viewers watching on prisonplanet.tv. But Joel Skalzen, of course, is better known
[01:15:08.080 --> 01:15:13.520]  as the best-selling author of The Secure Home. Strategic Relocation, now in its third edition.
[01:15:13.520 --> 01:15:19.100]  Both books and the video are available at infowarshop.com. And I produced a film with
[01:15:19.100 --> 01:15:24.400]  him breaking it down, Strategic Relocation, the film, all available at infowarshop.com
[01:15:24.400 --> 01:15:25.880]  if you wanna support all of our work.
[01:15:25.880 --> 01:15:31.920]  But what I'm saying is people are finally waking up that there's an arms buildup, a
[01:15:31.920 --> 01:15:36.680]  domestic buildup against us. They're finally getting the common sense that, hey, a standing
[01:15:36.680 --> 01:15:43.080]  army's dangerous. I know politically that if we keep pushing this, it will discredit
[01:15:43.080 --> 01:15:49.240]  their gun grab. Because why should we turn our guns in when they're arming to the teeth
[01:15:49.240 --> 01:15:52.320]  against us? Joel Skalzen.
[01:15:52.320 --> 01:15:58.480]  It's a really interesting conundrum, Alex, because there are two forces at work here.
[01:15:58.480 --> 01:16:04.840]  One, the government trying to provoke the right into displaying something radical enough
[01:16:04.840 --> 01:16:09.240]  to justify all of their warnings about the domestic terrorists on the right that the
[01:16:09.240 --> 01:16:13.560]  Southern Poverty Law Conference have been putting out. And at the same time, they're
[01:16:13.560 --> 01:16:19.720]  trying to push this gun control and it's backfiring on them. I mean, even the governor of New
[01:16:19.720 --> 01:16:26.320]  York is backtracking on the seven-round clips because there's such a wall of resistance.
[01:16:26.320 --> 01:16:31.640]  He's trying to placate that resistance. So they're overplaying their hand at the same
[01:16:31.640 --> 01:16:36.120]  time they're trying to get us to overplay our hand. And so we have to be very careful
[01:16:36.120 --> 01:16:41.080]  to walk this line. But I think you've got the exact appropriate right approach. We've
[01:16:41.080 --> 01:16:46.880]  got to go on the offensive without engendering anybody claiming, like, let's arm and let's
[01:16:46.880 --> 01:16:50.960]  go attack now. That would undermine our cause.
[01:16:50.960 --> 01:16:57.280]  But one thing is very clear, Alex. The government cannot use three billion rounds. The Department
[01:16:57.280 --> 01:17:06.080]  of Homeland Security cannot use three billion rounds of ammunition. It's 24 wars worth of
[01:17:06.080 --> 01:17:12.160]  handgun ammunition of the type that was in World War II. And so obviously, they're either
[01:17:12.160 --> 01:17:19.240]  trying to corner the market or simply enrage the people about this. And it could backfire
[01:17:19.240 --> 01:17:23.840]  on them. But I can tell you that Congress is getting extremely upset about this. I think
[01:17:23.840 --> 01:17:28.600]  that number of 15 congressmen is going to grow. If they don't get some answers, they
[01:17:28.600 --> 01:17:33.360]  are refusing to answer anybody in Congress. People are getting upset with the Department
[01:17:33.360 --> 01:17:37.920]  of Homeland Security, especially in the sequester environment, when they don't have any money
[01:17:37.920 --> 01:17:41.640]  to operate and they're buying three billion rounds of ammunition.
[01:17:41.640 --> 01:17:47.600]  Now, remember that these are requisitions. These have not been delivered yet. There are
[01:17:47.600 --> 01:17:52.040]  steady streams of ammunition being delivered to DHS, but nothing of this quantity.
[01:17:52.040 --> 01:17:58.280]  No, exactly. What it's done is they're buying whatever the companies say they can manufacture.
[01:17:58.280 --> 01:18:03.280]  I mean, I've dug into it. As much as they can make, they're cornering the market. Clearly,
[01:18:03.280 --> 01:18:07.480]  that is one level of what they're doing. That is the main cause of the shortages. What you
[01:18:07.480 --> 01:18:15.840]  can't get is the 308, the 223, the 40 hollow point. What you can't get is what they're
[01:18:15.840 --> 01:18:16.840]  purchasing.
[01:18:16.840 --> 01:18:21.840]  Now, I also have contacts in Canada with the gun manufacturers in Canada who have said
[01:18:21.840 --> 01:18:26.900]  they've received phone calls from government pressuring them not to import any more weapons
[01:18:26.900 --> 01:18:32.340]  into the United States. They can't legally require them not to, but they're warning them,
[01:18:32.340 --> 01:18:36.560]  we don't want any more imports. They're trying to dry up the supply. Very, very clearly.
[01:18:36.560 --> 01:18:40.680]  Oh, yeah, that's what Bloomberg and Obama and all of them have said in their task force.
[01:18:40.680 --> 01:18:45.640]  They said, we're calling manufacturers, we're calling government leaders, and we're saying
[01:18:45.640 --> 01:18:51.300]  what we can do outside of law. Is that not really racketeering to have them just leaning
[01:18:51.300 --> 01:18:52.760]  on people?
[01:18:52.760 --> 01:18:58.100]  It is. This is a conspiracy, and it's proof that they're in collusion to try to stop Americans
[01:18:58.100 --> 01:19:06.600]  from having weapons. But it's only exacerbating in their minds the weapons because...
[01:19:06.600 --> 01:19:13.600]  That was my next point. Don't tyrants get that their open attack is what always backfires?
[01:19:13.600 --> 01:19:19.340]  The fact that they've done this has absolutely begun to mobilize people.
[01:19:19.340 --> 01:19:22.620]  And I don't think it's going to stop. It's just like the Cypriot situation. They put
[01:19:22.620 --> 01:19:28.880]  on controls on everything.
[01:19:28.880 --> 01:19:33.600]  We lost his Skype for a moment. The wonders of Skype, but still it occasionally cuts out.
[01:19:33.600 --> 01:19:37.020]  We're going to try to reconnect with Joel Skousen, and we'll look at what's happening
[01:19:37.020 --> 01:19:45.080]  in Cyprus. I haven't gotten to that yet. I've covered one stack of news. There are 12 others,
[01:19:45.080 --> 01:19:49.400]  12 other stacks that we're going to be covering in open phones in the third hour. We're going
[01:19:49.400 --> 01:19:54.040]  to look at what's happening in Cyprus with Joel Skousen straight ahead of World Affairs
[01:19:54.040 --> 01:19:58.780]  Brief, and we'll give you that URL on the other side. JoelSkousen.com will also get
[01:19:58.780 --> 01:19:59.780]  you there.
[01:19:59.780 --> 01:20:07.260]  Hello, I'm Alex Jones. Myself, my family, the Infowars.com team want to relay to you

[01:22:30.660 --> 01:22:34.960]  grow cotton, weave fabric, engrave ink, embed strips and fibers to protect from counterfeit
[01:22:34.960 --> 01:22:39.100]  and carting to a private bank, having it lead back at interest, forcing taxes to service
[01:22:39.100 --> 01:22:43.180]  debt. This capitalism or was Jefferson correct when stating a central bank issuing the public
[01:22:43.180 --> 01:22:46.900]  currency is a greater menace to the liberties of the people than a standing army. Hi, Ted
[01:22:46.900 --> 01:22:50.740]  Anderson. I'm placing a free silver dollar in a book that explains our monetary system.
[01:22:50.740 --> 01:22:57.760]  Call for your copy, 800-686-2237. It's time to understand the system. Call 800-686-2237.
[01:22:57.760 --> 01:23:03.740]  That's 800-686-2237. Amino acids are the building blocks of proteins. Amino acids have to be
[01:23:03.740 --> 01:23:07.820]  delivered to your body in the shape that nature gave them. If they are to be used to create
[01:23:07.820 --> 01:23:12.420]  new proteins in your body, just like a bricklayer cannot use bent or twisted bricks to build
[01:23:12.420 --> 01:23:18.060]  a brick wall, so too your body cannot use bent or twisted amino acids to build new proteins.
[01:23:18.060 --> 01:23:22.800]  Given your body an undamaged amino acid food can make a huge difference in your health.
[01:23:22.800 --> 01:23:28.060]  One world way is an undamaged amino acid food unlike any other. You see, heating bends and
[01:23:28.060 --> 01:23:33.120]  twists amino acids and all whey protein powders we've investigated and most proteins you
[01:23:33.120 --> 01:23:38.580]  consume are heated. With our TrueCool process, you now have a choice with One World Whey.
[01:23:38.580 --> 01:23:43.460]  My name is Daniel. I'm 34 years old. When I started using One World Whey, I weighed
[01:23:43.460 --> 01:23:49.980]  228 pounds. Now, after two and a half months, I weigh 182 pounds. This is my ideal weight.
[01:23:49.980 --> 01:23:53.940]  I've noticed an increase in stamina, rate of recovery from workouts, and an increase
[01:23:53.940 --> 01:24:11.180]  in my potency. Call 888-988-3325 or visit OneWorldWhey.com.
[01:24:11.180 --> 01:24:16.060]  All right, my friends, Alex Jones here, back live. You know, I told you more than a decade
[01:24:16.060 --> 01:24:20.580]  ago because it was in IMF and World Bank plans. I wrote about it in my book, The Scent into
[01:24:20.580 --> 01:24:28.720]  Tyranny 2002. It's on record, ebooks posted right now at Infowarsnews.com for all subscribers.
[01:24:28.720 --> 01:24:34.100]  The book's out of print. Their own documents, they plan to bankrupt Europe and the US and
[01:24:34.100 --> 01:24:37.980]  transfer the jobs to China, but they don't completely trust China, so they'll keep our
[01:24:37.980 --> 01:24:40.260]  military just to menace them.
[01:24:40.260 --> 01:24:46.540]  It's all about not having any one group that can stand up for itself. And now, even mainstream
[01:24:46.540 --> 01:24:51.480]  news admits most the debt is not that of the people in Cyprus. It's gone to back up private
[01:24:51.480 --> 01:24:56.360]  central bank's debt. And first, they were gonna take 10% out of everybody's account.
[01:24:56.360 --> 01:25:04.180]  Now the deal, we have the official EU video coming up, is 40%, the top 40% of bank accounts,
[01:25:04.180 --> 01:25:08.660]  that's a lot of people, will have 7% to 15% taken out. Now they're talking about it in
[01:25:08.660 --> 01:25:09.660]  other countries.
[01:25:09.660 --> 01:25:15.460]  So foreign banks taking money directly out of your bank account to pay them, that is
[01:25:15.460 --> 01:25:22.340]  the essence of the new world order. Joel Skalzen of World Affairs Brief joins us to break that
[01:25:22.340 --> 01:25:26.940]  down. Joel, you started getting into Cyprus before your Skype had an interruption.
[01:25:26.940 --> 01:25:34.460]  Yes, well the Cyprus has taken a turn for the better for the EU. I keep saying time
[01:25:34.460 --> 01:25:38.940]  and again, they will do anything it takes to keep the EU alive and not let these countries
[01:25:38.940 --> 01:25:42.580]  leave. And that has proven out correctly, even though they have really had to pull all
[01:25:42.580 --> 01:25:49.460]  the stops out against bank accounts in order to do so. They did the populous thing by saving
[01:25:49.460 --> 01:25:55.260]  those with less than $100,000 accounts. But what they did basically is eliminate the second
[01:25:55.260 --> 01:26:02.940]  largest bank, the Lycos Bank, and they've taken 40% of the largest depositors of that
[01:26:02.940 --> 01:26:08.140]  bank and transferred it to the Bank of Cyprus as well as all the $100,000 of below accounts
[01:26:08.140 --> 01:26:14.380]  from Lycos into the Bank of Cyprus. So they've made one bank completely liquidated, the second
[01:26:14.380 --> 01:26:23.540]  largest bank, and taken 40% of those accounts. And now that's a major, major haircut. But
[01:26:23.540 --> 01:26:33.100]  remember they made investors in the Greek banks take a 50% haircut during that bailout.
[01:26:33.100 --> 01:26:38.180]  What's interesting though is that I found out that the Russian, the majority of the
[01:26:38.180 --> 01:26:44.220]  Russian deposits had already left that bank and it transferred their money over to the
[01:26:44.220 --> 01:26:50.460]  Bank of Cyprus. And so essentially they let the non-Russian large investors take that
[01:26:50.460 --> 01:26:57.740]  haircut in preserving the Bank of Cyprus. But at the same time, because they have completely
[01:26:57.740 --> 01:27:04.300]  destroyed the trust in the banks, they have no definite opening date for the Bank of Cyprus.
[01:27:04.300 --> 01:27:09.860]  They still have a limit of 120 euros a day for people to take out of the ATMs. And they're
[01:27:09.860 --> 01:27:15.180]  going to have limits, indefinite limits, on further withdrawals from the Bank of Cyprus
[01:27:15.180 --> 01:27:24.860]  after this so-called thing is resolved. So what it means is Cyprus is done as an economy.
[01:27:24.860 --> 01:27:30.280]  They're just simply, I don't know how they're going to survive. The banking economy was
[01:27:30.280 --> 01:27:35.700]  about eight times larger than the real tourist economy. So what they're going to have to
[01:27:35.700 --> 01:27:42.220]  do is prolong this until they can get the major gas fields online in Cyprus, which have
[01:27:42.220 --> 01:27:49.620]  the potential of replacing about 40% of Europe's gas needs. That's a cash cow I think they're
[01:27:49.620 --> 01:27:55.860]  holding on to for future use in Cyprus.
[01:27:55.860 --> 01:28:00.540]  Joel Skalzen is our guest. What does this do to people all over the world, their confidence
[01:28:00.540 --> 01:28:05.820]  in banks? Not only do you not get interest now, but now it's your money and they just
[01:28:05.820 --> 01:28:09.380]  come and steal it to give it to private interest. I mean, this is unprecedented.
[01:28:09.380 --> 01:28:17.140]  Well, they have done it to specifically, as you say, to bolster the private interest of
[01:28:17.140 --> 01:28:23.100]  the Bank of Cyprus. They've made some people whole and they've taken everything from other
[01:28:23.100 --> 01:28:27.660]  people. Remember, when you liquidate that account, they say they're taking 40%, but
[01:28:27.660 --> 01:28:33.340]  actually the whole bank is being liquidated. And that means that even for the first time,
[01:28:33.340 --> 01:28:38.660]  senior bondholders, the first in line, are having to take a haircut. Though, from what
[01:28:38.660 --> 01:28:45.220]  I hear from my European sources, it's not very much of a haircut. They are taking the
[01:28:45.220 --> 01:28:49.340]  unsecured creditors over $100,000 and making them lose everything.
[01:28:49.340 --> 01:28:55.460]  Sure, sure, and let me be specific here. I had read the articles out this morning. They're
[01:28:55.460 --> 01:29:02.820]  up on infowars.com, Paul Joseph Watson's article. Europe, anyone with over 100,000 euro savings
[01:29:02.820 --> 01:29:09.260]  now has to have 40% taken out of their account. And I had what I'd call a Freudian mistake,
[01:29:09.260 --> 01:29:12.020]  because before it was just gonna be 10 to 15% they took out.
[01:29:12.020 --> 01:29:17.940]  Some estimates for 7.7 or even 6.9. And I mentally cannot believe they're gonna take
[01:29:17.940 --> 01:29:24.700]  40% out of anybody with over 100,000 euros. So my mind twisted that. I mean, that is so
[01:29:24.700 --> 01:29:30.940]  huge that anybody over 100,000 euros is wealthy. Most people that are retired, even if they
[01:29:30.940 --> 01:29:35.580]  worked their whole life as a janitor, they better have 100,000 euros. I mean, that's
[01:29:35.580 --> 01:29:36.580]  nothing.
[01:29:36.580 --> 01:29:40.780]  That with inflation, that is, I mean, that's janitors and people should have that much
[01:29:40.780 --> 01:29:44.820]  saved. This is just incredible. And it shows what they're gonna do. I want to talk about
[01:29:44.820 --> 01:29:48.660]  that with Joel Scouser when we come back and where he sees the world economy going, then
[01:29:48.660 --> 01:29:50.220]  his plane crash.
[01:29:50.220 --> 01:29:57.580]  We're on the march. The Empire's on the run. Alex Jones and the GCN radio network.

[01:33:05.220 --> 01:33:16.300]  Alex Jones on the GCN radio network. Ladies and gentlemen, I spend let's not exaggerate
[01:33:16.300 --> 01:33:23.500]  six seven hours a day trying to research news and information on top of being on the air.
[01:33:23.500 --> 01:33:28.220]  And I can't keep track of but a fraction of what's happening. But everywhere we look,
[01:33:28.220 --> 01:33:34.060]  corruption is moving at light speed. And the more the corrupt raid pension funds engage
[01:33:34.060 --> 01:33:42.140]  in new taxes, regulations, new insider cronyism. The more that accelerates, the more other
[01:33:42.140 --> 01:33:46.780]  criminals are able to move in government and corporations. And it creates kind of a swarm
[01:33:46.780 --> 01:33:53.180]  effect against which there aren't a lot of defenses other than having good people swarm
[01:33:53.180 --> 01:33:55.060]  back at them.
[01:33:55.060 --> 01:34:00.660]  And get in their face and sue them and criticize them and resist them. And that's why we've
[01:34:00.660 --> 01:34:04.780]  got to get you active because when you just go to a city council meeting, that freaks
[01:34:04.780 --> 01:34:08.820]  them out. When you go to one of their agenda 21 meetings and expose the fact you know it's
[01:34:08.820 --> 01:34:14.860]  a global financial espionage takeover, it freaks them out.
[01:34:14.860 --> 01:34:20.580]  When you run for office and for city or county or state and go to these debates, it freaks
[01:34:20.580 --> 01:34:26.020]  them out. And it educates others and then you'll meet like minded people. And you could
[01:34:26.020 --> 01:34:30.300]  start creating your own centers of resistance. Now, we're gonna go back to our guest and
[01:34:30.300 --> 01:34:34.660]  cover the waterfront here, finish up with the financials, get into some of the geopolitical's
[01:34:34.660 --> 01:34:41.020]  and then also talk about what's happening in the aftermath of his plane crash and we're
[01:34:41.020 --> 01:34:42.760]  certainly glad he survived that.
[01:34:42.760 --> 01:34:47.340]  But briefly, if you wanna wake people up, it is not just about what regions are the
[01:34:47.340 --> 01:34:51.540]  safest area. And of course, that's in sub regions right around where you live. If you
[01:34:51.540 --> 01:34:57.800]  can't go to these safest places in America, there are also places that you can go to in
[01:34:57.800 --> 01:35:05.320]  your region. It's in the book, Strategic Relocation, third edition, available at infowarstore.com.
[01:35:05.320 --> 01:35:10.140]  And you can also get the film I produced with Joel, Strategic Relocation, the film that
[01:35:10.140 --> 01:35:17.500]  gets into the geopolitical, the world regions, the ethnic balkanization they use, all of
[01:35:17.500 --> 01:35:21.480]  it is in this two and a half hour presentation.
[01:35:21.480 --> 01:35:28.340]  There's also his book as well, The Secure Home, that is the Bible of securing homes
[01:35:28.340 --> 01:35:33.780]  on a small budget or a medium budget or a large budget. You can get them all three together
[01:35:33.780 --> 01:35:40.280]  or individually discounted at infowarstore or infowarshop.com. And your purchase also
[01:35:40.280 --> 01:35:44.660]  supports the broadcast, so it's a win, win, win. You get valuable information and we also

[01:35:56.180 --> 01:36:01.000]  is our guest. He is the editor and publisher of World Affairs Brief. And we'll put that
[01:36:01.000 --> 01:36:04.380]  website up on screen for viewers here in just a moment.
[01:36:04.380 --> 01:36:08.100]  Joel, I wanna move quick now, cuz I've got all my long winded points and you've got all
[01:36:08.100 --> 01:36:13.980]  your points. Finishing up with what you expect to happen now, because here are some of the
[01:36:13.980 --> 01:36:19.740]  headlines. It's official, banks in Europe may now seize deposits to cover their gambling
[01:36:19.740 --> 01:36:20.740]  losses.
[01:36:20.740 --> 01:36:28.000]  And I tuned into our news, Fox Radio, CNN, they're like, boy, Cyprus and the Cypriots
[01:36:28.000 --> 01:36:33.460]  got the help they needed, a bailout, when it's not their bailout. It's pure global mafia
[01:36:33.460 --> 01:36:40.660]  robbing a bank to prop up the EU. Here's another one, Europe, 100,000 savings now considered
[01:36:40.660 --> 01:36:44.700]  wealthy, everybody above that 40% peeled out of your account.
[01:36:44.700 --> 01:36:48.420]  And as Joel was just pointing out, the rich had already gotten the word, they're all exempt,
[01:36:48.420 --> 01:36:52.960]  the truly rich. It's the middle class they wanna shut down. It's always the mega rich
[01:36:52.960 --> 01:36:57.240]  robbing the middle class. That's what Bill Gates, all of them, that's what Warren Buffett's
[01:36:57.240 --> 01:37:00.620]  about when he says raise taxes, he gets bailout money.
[01:37:00.620 --> 01:37:04.860]  Cyprus bank bailout agreement is pure theft, 40% of private deposits to be looted from
[01:37:04.860 --> 01:37:12.700]  selected accounts. Words of warning, get your money out of European banks. That's just some
[01:37:12.700 --> 01:37:18.680]  of the headlines that are up on infowars.com and prisonplanet.com. But Cyprus strikes last
[01:37:18.680 --> 01:37:20.980]  minute EU bailout deal, London Guardian.
[01:37:20.980 --> 01:37:26.740]  It is not a bailout. A bailout would be a bank coming and bailing out the country that
[01:37:26.740 --> 01:37:32.460]  has bad credit. But the very banks are giving us bad credit ratings, while they themselves
[01:37:32.460 --> 01:37:36.560]  are the black holes of the derivatives. Joel, I know you've studied and written about this
[01:37:36.560 --> 01:37:43.100]  for decades. Again, if you just joined us, Joel Skalzen was a Marine Corps aviator and
[01:37:43.100 --> 01:37:44.100]  Vietnam carrier.
[01:37:44.100 --> 01:37:49.400]  Guy, we're gonna talk about his crash landing a few weeks ago here in a moment. But you
[01:37:49.400 --> 01:37:55.580]  hear me throwing all this out, the sense of alarm in my voice. Why are they so bold as
[01:37:55.580 --> 01:38:00.820]  to start doing this? Is it a test to see if they can get the media to just normalize this
[01:38:00.820 --> 01:38:03.460]  new direct taxation to the globalist?
[01:38:03.460 --> 01:38:08.740]  Well, Alex, they actually had no other choice. There wasn't any money to extract. Normally,
[01:38:08.740 --> 01:38:13.540]  as in Ireland, they required the taxpayers to pick up the tab for a portion of the bailout
[01:38:13.540 --> 01:38:20.460]  on condition of them giving European money into them. They, in fact, did hand over 20
[01:38:20.460 --> 01:38:27.780]  billion euros from the banking system, the central bank and the IMF to these banks to
[01:38:27.780 --> 01:38:34.260]  make them whole. And they liquidated one and took money, what was remaining in that bank,
[01:38:34.260 --> 01:38:36.820]  and gave it over to another one.
[01:38:36.820 --> 01:38:43.180]  Remember that the 40% is only an average, Alec. Some people lost everything in this,
[01:38:43.180 --> 01:38:50.140]  and the highest senior bond stakeholders maybe lost 10%. So it was.
[01:38:50.140 --> 01:38:58.380]  Now we just lost Joel Skousen again, we'll get him reconnected via Skype. Hey, it's worth
[01:38:58.380 --> 01:39:07.420]  it, it sounds better than phone line. Now again, ladies and gentlemen, this is affecting
[01:39:07.420 --> 01:39:21.680]  the entire global economy. And yes, the EU does not allow, at least on paper, for governments
[01:39:21.680 --> 01:39:23.780]  to then bail themselves out.
[01:39:23.780 --> 01:39:30.900]  So how it's done is they just take it directly out of the bank accounts. Truly, truly unprecedented
[01:39:30.900 --> 01:39:35.900]  that all of this is going on. And I watch television, I listen to the news. The average
[01:39:35.900 --> 01:39:41.700]  American would have no idea. In fact, I probably heard Fox News Radio seven or eight times
[01:39:41.700 --> 01:39:46.020]  this weekend and it was like, yeah, a tough bailout plan in Cyprus.
[01:39:46.020 --> 01:39:50.160]  But the country saved. And then meanwhile, you read deeper, they're now admitting the
[01:39:50.160 --> 01:39:59.960]  country is even in worse shape. And this is not going to bail them out at all. Moody says,
[01:39:59.960 --> 01:40:06.900]  even with the New Deal. Even with the New Deal, Cyprus could still default and leave
[01:40:06.900 --> 01:40:07.900]  the euro.
[01:40:07.900 --> 01:40:12.660]  Joel, we've got you back here, back with radio connection here to the carrier base as you're
[01:40:12.660 --> 01:40:17.900]  flying in. You cut out when you mentioned the point about some people lost everything.
[01:40:17.900 --> 01:40:23.260]  See, my mind isn't even computing that. In fact, they talk about that in psychological
[01:40:23.260 --> 01:40:28.580]  warfare, how our minds tend to automatically lessen how bad something is.
[01:40:28.580 --> 01:40:32.660]  I forget the name of that, but I guess it's called denial. That's right. People accuse
[01:40:32.660 --> 01:40:37.300]  me of exaggerating. It's worse than that. Some people had everything taken. Go ahead.
[01:40:37.300 --> 01:40:43.380]  That's right. As I say, it was an average of 40 percent and most of the medium sized,
[01:40:43.380 --> 01:40:49.220]  middle class, wealthy lost everything. The senior bondholders had a stake probably no
[01:40:49.220 --> 01:40:52.420]  more than about 10 percent that they had to give up.
[01:40:52.420 --> 01:40:58.100]  But you're absolutely right in the analysis that Cyprus simply has no income to service
[01:40:58.100 --> 01:41:02.380]  this additional debt. They're taking the debt, but they're going to have to give more bailouts
[01:41:02.380 --> 01:41:09.260]  until the gas comes back on in Cyprus. They've got huge gas reserves coming online, hopefully
[01:41:09.260 --> 01:41:17.940]  in 2018. Until then, Cyprus is going to be in red ink, continually need more bailouts.
[01:41:17.940 --> 01:41:24.340]  The Spanish and Portuguese savers are saying that they're next. I think you're going to
[01:41:24.340 --> 01:41:30.220]  see some pretty stiff runs on the banks in Spain and Portugal and Italy as they transfer
[01:41:30.220 --> 01:41:37.140]  money out of those banks into the safer German and Swiss banks, because they know now that
[01:41:37.140 --> 01:41:40.620]  everybody's at risk of having their deposits grabbed.
[01:41:40.620 --> 01:41:45.700]  Now, I want to mention one other thing. I've had a long history of people asking me advice.
[01:41:45.700 --> 01:41:49.880]  I keep telling them, don't put your money in overseas bank accounts. Everybody wants
[01:41:49.880 --> 01:41:54.780]  to avoid the IRS trap here and get the money overseas. And I said, someday you're going
[01:41:54.780 --> 01:41:59.520]  to lose it because they're simply going to cut off access. And this has made believers
[01:41:59.520 --> 01:42:04.660]  and a lot of them, you're going to see a run on overseas bank accounts repatriating it
[01:42:04.660 --> 01:42:07.820]  back into the United States.
[01:42:07.820 --> 01:42:10.660]  And so short term, this will probably help the dollar?
[01:42:10.660 --> 01:42:15.360]  Absolutely. You know, the dollar is being helped right now by the fact that most countries
[01:42:15.360 --> 01:42:20.620]  are inflating much higher than the dollar percentage wise. And that's why gold and silver
[01:42:20.620 --> 01:42:25.980]  are flat and slightly declining, because the dollar is looking strong relative to all of
[01:42:25.980 --> 01:42:27.300]  the other weaker currencies.
[01:42:27.300 --> 01:42:30.980]  Now, I know you're familiar with Dr. Paul Craig Roberts, former head of the Treasury
[01:42:30.980 --> 01:42:35.900]  and Policy, the father of Reaganomics. He says it's a triple bubble. I mean, obviously
[01:42:35.900 --> 01:42:43.360]  that's true bonds. And then, of course, you've got stocks and well, and there's really more
[01:42:43.360 --> 01:42:48.540]  than three bubbles if you count real estate and other things. But what is your take on
[01:42:48.540 --> 01:42:50.060]  how long this can go?
[01:42:50.060 --> 01:42:55.120]  Because obviously it's being orchestrated at many levels. But if Cyprus and Europe really
[01:42:55.120 --> 01:43:00.020]  are having real problems, couldn't that cause a chain reaction? At first, it will make us
[01:43:00.020 --> 01:43:06.700]  buoy, but won't it cause problems after that first bubbling effect?
[01:43:06.700 --> 01:43:13.020]  It could if they failed to support it. I mean, they've got enough means with the huge dollar
[01:43:13.020 --> 01:43:18.660]  base that they have to continue to inflate. The Fed can throw out almost nine trillion
[01:43:18.660 --> 01:43:23.900]  dollars a year and not exceed 10 percent inflation of the money supply. So they've got a tremendous
[01:43:23.900 --> 01:43:30.820]  power to continue to bail out. The great danger is if they get into a high inflation situation,
[01:43:30.820 --> 01:43:35.960]  it would force interest rates up, which would collapse the phony recovery that we're seeing.
[01:43:35.960 --> 01:43:40.280]  So I think they're going to work very, very hard to keep bailouts to the minimum. That's
[01:43:40.280 --> 01:43:43.980]  why they had to take some of these deposits instead of make it a pure bailout so there
[01:43:43.980 --> 01:43:49.780]  wasn't as inflationary on the euro. But they can keep going. And I believe they're going
[01:43:49.780 --> 01:43:54.860]  to do whatever it takes to keep going until war comes, because war gives them cover.
[01:43:54.860 --> 01:44:00.100]  They don't get the blame for any banking collapse. Then it's the war that causes it. So I think
[01:44:00.100 --> 01:44:06.380]  we're going to see it stretch out until Russia and China finally attack the West.
[01:44:06.380 --> 01:44:10.140]  Let me raise that issue with you, because I talked to them about the Koch brothers last
[01:44:10.140 --> 01:44:14.220]  hour. I'm always being accused of working for them with no proof, so I did some research
[01:44:14.220 --> 01:44:20.060]  on them. And they're globalist. They're tied into some of the big foundations. But they
[01:44:20.060 --> 01:44:25.100]  are fighting in 2021 in the shutdown of their own plants, which even if you hate wealthy
[01:44:25.100 --> 01:44:29.060]  people folks, it's going to increase your gas prices if they shut down the refineries
[01:44:29.060 --> 01:44:30.920]  and the coal plants and things.
[01:44:30.920 --> 01:44:37.380]  But they're the favorite demon. But then I look at Soros and people, and Berkshire Hathaway
[01:44:37.380 --> 01:44:42.340]  shutting down the Keystone Pipeline, making sure China gets that oil. So they make the
[01:44:42.340 --> 01:44:46.860]  profits. I agree with you that it's obviously China, Russia, and the Anglo-American establishment
[01:44:46.860 --> 01:44:47.860]  is blocks.
[01:44:47.860 --> 01:44:53.060]  You've got the bricks in between Russia and China. But those two authoritarian groups
[01:44:53.060 --> 01:44:59.420]  don't trust each other either. What is the point of deindustrializing America if the
[01:44:59.420 --> 01:45:04.580]  globalist aren't in full control of China? Why are they putting so many eggs, giving
[01:45:04.580 --> 01:45:09.180]  them the Panama Canal, just giving them everything, giving them all our deep water ports on the
[01:45:09.180 --> 01:45:10.180]  West Coast?
[01:45:10.180 --> 01:45:14.980]  I mean, it is just incredible. A foreign air force couldn't bomb out our factories this
[01:45:14.980 --> 01:45:15.980]  bad.
[01:45:15.980 --> 01:45:22.180]  Well, I really don't believe that the Anglo-American establishment controls China. I believe China's
[01:45:22.180 --> 01:45:29.020]  an independent predator. But I think that they have been helping build an enemy in help
[01:45:29.020 --> 01:45:33.940]  as they have built Russia and helped Russia since the very beginning of the revolution.
[01:45:33.940 --> 01:45:38.540]  They're still continuing to help China. And that's why we've seen, as I've covered in
[01:45:38.540 --> 01:45:45.140]  the World Affairs Briefs, they continue to hire Chinese scientists into NASA research.
[01:45:45.140 --> 01:45:49.220]  They continue to have exchanges into our weapons laboratories. They're really trying to make
[01:45:49.220 --> 01:45:54.060]  sure they get all the technology they need to have the confidence to threaten the West.
[01:45:54.060 --> 01:45:58.660]  Yeah, the number I saw was 10,000. And they just let them go right back with all the secrets
[01:45:58.660 --> 01:46:00.060]  knowingly.
[01:46:00.060 --> 01:46:04.320]  And they continue to hand out visas like water to Chinese students coming over to our top
[01:46:04.320 --> 01:46:09.780]  universities. And they do very well in science. And they take back those secrets there, too.
[01:46:09.780 --> 01:46:15.980]  But you know, there's a major sea change happening right now in Russia. And I'm going to do a
[01:46:15.980 --> 01:46:21.960]  special edition of the World Affairs Brief coming out this Friday on what the Berezovsky
[01:46:21.960 --> 01:46:28.540]  assassination means and what they have in store for the two other competitors, Roman
[01:46:28.540 --> 01:46:35.500]  Abramovich and Mikhail Korokovsky, who's currently in prison but is getting ready to stage a
[01:46:35.500 --> 01:46:36.500]  major comeback.
[01:46:36.500 --> 01:46:42.660]  Okay, you just got to my next question, which I hadn't told you yet. Obviously, so many
[01:46:42.660 --> 01:46:48.040]  people get killed, assassinated. And you know it's an assassination when, as soon as it
[01:46:48.040 --> 01:46:54.740]  comes out, there's not even an autopsy. They say no foul play. No evidence that Borovoski
[01:46:54.740 --> 01:47:00.260]  was killed, say police, locked in the bathroom. That's proof that he killed himself with a
[01:47:00.260 --> 01:47:04.700]  scarf next to him, which would be a clear message that he was killed.
[01:47:04.700 --> 01:47:10.860]  A big enemy of Putin, at least on the surface, geopolitically. Joe Scalzen, what does this
[01:47:10.860 --> 01:47:11.860]  mean?
[01:47:11.860 --> 01:47:16.620]  Well, you know, I had belief for many years because, you know, Putin met with Berezovsky,
[01:47:16.620 --> 01:47:21.540]  according to Spanish intelligence, five times the year he ascended to the presidency. So
[01:47:21.540 --> 01:47:29.100]  clearly Putin was a Berezovsky minion when he started out. But at some point, Putin and
[01:47:29.100 --> 01:47:32.740]  Berezovsky had a falling out. I thought it was political theater. I thought it would
[01:47:32.740 --> 01:47:37.780]  be stupid for Berezovsky to say from his London villa that he was going to finance a coup
[01:47:37.780 --> 01:47:42.620]  against Putin. I mean, nobody would do that publicly if they were intending to do it.
[01:47:42.620 --> 01:47:53.180]  But with the assassination of Litvinenko and Berezovsky now, who were very close, and Litvinenko
[01:47:53.180 --> 01:48:01.460]  had in fact fingered a lot of the KGB, FSB, phony bombings of apartments in order to justify
[01:48:01.460 --> 01:48:08.140]  their war on terror in Chechnya. He became put on a list for assassination and they took
[01:48:08.140 --> 01:48:16.260]  him out and Berezovsky did himself. But interestingly enough, both Abramovich and Khodorkovsky,
[01:48:16.260 --> 01:48:23.060]  the two younger wealthy oligarchs who are the wealthiest, not counting Gazinsky of the
[01:48:23.060 --> 01:48:29.540]  media king there in Russia, these people both got their start into being wealthy through
[01:48:29.540 --> 01:48:37.700]  Boris Berezovsky. And of course, Berezovsky lost this major court battle with Abramovich,
[01:48:37.700 --> 01:48:42.540]  even though he had basically given him the stock and made Abramovich rich. Abramovich
[01:48:42.540 --> 01:48:50.140]  took a run with it and essentially cut Berezovsky out. Khodorkovsky and Yukos Oil also did his
[01:48:50.140 --> 01:48:55.060]  deal with Berezovsky and apparently cut him out as well. So it looked like there's some
[01:48:55.060 --> 01:49:00.480]  major infighting between two other factions. Putin may be a third. I'm not sure which one
[01:49:00.480 --> 01:49:07.160]  he's aligned with. But this is very serious. The Anglo-American establishment also got
[01:49:07.160 --> 01:49:14.980]  their fingers in the pie. I found out that Mikhail Khodorkovsky had sold or given, I'm
[01:49:14.980 --> 01:49:22.580]  sorry, given his shares in Yukos Oil to Jacob Rothschild, major player in the Anglo-American
[01:49:22.580 --> 01:49:28.060]  establishment just before he was indicted and when he went to prison. So essentially-
[01:49:28.060 --> 01:49:32.580]  That's happened repeatedly in the Rothschild's sue if people claim that, but then have lost
[01:49:32.580 --> 01:49:37.140]  the lawsuits. So that's been reported in the Financial Times of London, absolutely. How
[01:49:37.140 --> 01:49:44.220]  powerful are the Rothschild's? Well, I think they are the key base of money operations
[01:49:44.220 --> 01:49:50.840]  of the globalists. And there is a major US component to that now, which competes with
[01:49:50.840 --> 01:49:55.500]  them to a certain extent. But I think the Rothschild's are the biggest financial base
[01:49:55.500 --> 01:49:59.780]  of the new world order that we're dealing with. What is their ideology? Because they're
[01:49:59.780 --> 01:50:03.500]  reportedly, at least part Jewish, they've married into some of the royalty over there.
[01:50:03.500 --> 01:50:07.940]  But I always see them also funding eugenics and just really nasty stuff.
[01:50:07.940 --> 01:50:13.540]  Well, I think their ideology is globalist, which means that they're socialist of the
[01:50:13.540 --> 01:50:18.420]  variety that believes in milking capitalism, not destroying it, not nationalizing. It's
[01:50:18.420 --> 01:50:23.500]  a Fabian type of socialism. But they also play, as you know, the Hegelian dialect, they're
[01:50:23.500 --> 01:50:29.180]  playing both sides. They've got their fingers in the Russian conspiracy this time. What's
[01:50:29.180 --> 01:50:36.060]  interesting is that Horakowski is, in fact, the one who's promoting the return of communism.
[01:50:36.060 --> 01:50:40.420]  That's right. And it was Rothschild's that helped finance communism.
[01:50:40.420 --> 01:50:44.380]  That's right. But whether or not he really represents the underground communists that
[01:50:44.380 --> 01:50:49.780]  right now control Putin. Putin is not running the show. Putin is a puppet. He runs from
[01:50:49.780 --> 01:50:52.500]  the major communist conspiracy that faked their own demise.
[01:50:52.500 --> 01:50:55.300]  Well, stay there. Let's break that down. And we can't hold you into the next hour to cover
[01:50:55.300 --> 01:51:01.680]  the plane crash. Believe me, it was incredible. We'll be right back. Stay with us.

[01:53:05.500 --> 01:53:11.060]  you to know some very important information. In 1985, President Ronald Reagan requested
[01:53:11.060 --> 01:53:15.340]  that Carnivora be sent directly to the White House at a time when only the President could
[01:53:15.340 --> 01:53:20.820]  obtain this world-class healer. Now, 27 years later, Carnivora capsules are used around
[01:53:20.820 --> 01:53:25.260]  the world to keep people healthy. Now you can protect yourself and your loved ones in

[01:54:42.180 --> 01:54:47.100]  work sometimes, just get another membership. Great way to wake people up, very well produced,
[01:54:47.100 --> 01:54:52.060]  hard hitting Nightly News, 7 o'clock central, 8 o'clock eastern. We also come back Sundays
[01:54:52.060 --> 01:54:57.220]  4 to 6 p.m. Joel's gonna be with us 20 minutes into the next hour. I thought, take a few
[01:54:57.220 --> 01:55:01.700]  phone calls for Joel after we come back in the next hour and tell his plane crash story.
[01:55:01.700 --> 01:55:07.180]  A few phone calls for Joel. If you've got any questions, his website's WorldAffairsBrief.com.
[01:55:07.180 --> 01:55:13.380]  Our sites are Infowars.com and PrisonPlanet.tv. And again, you're listening to the Alex Jones
[01:55:13.380 --> 01:55:18.220]  show here. After he leaves us, I got a bunch of news and your phone calls I'm gonna get
[01:55:18.220 --> 01:55:22.300]  back into. Joel, before we start the next hour and get into your plane crash and some
[01:55:22.300 --> 01:55:28.540]  other issues, it just seems like everything is accelerating, more murders, more hits,
[01:55:28.540 --> 01:55:33.180]  more corruption, government going wild.
[01:55:33.180 --> 01:55:39.060]  Even if it wakes people up, they want our guns. What is the impetus towards everything,
[01:55:39.060 --> 01:55:46.900]  I would say accelerating 100% or more? Why is that happening in your research?
[01:55:46.900 --> 01:55:53.460]  It's hard to say, Alex, despite the acceleration, there are certain fixed things that they cannot
[01:55:53.460 --> 01:55:59.060]  accelerate and one of those is inducing Russia and China to attack the West and they cannot
[01:55:59.060 --> 01:56:06.340]  get to a new world order without that attack. And so there clearly are prepping American
[01:56:06.340 --> 01:56:12.800]  people and prepping militaristic, whether it's mercenary types or department of Homeland
[01:56:12.800 --> 01:56:18.260]  Security to take down dissidents someday. Even though that is accelerating tremendously,
[01:56:18.260 --> 01:56:23.500]  it takes a long time and a lot of people that they've got to gain to do that.
[01:56:23.500 --> 01:56:28.460]  Sure, and so what do they do if this flips around against them and we figure out there's
[01:56:28.460 --> 01:56:32.540]  an arms buildup, couldn't that actually set them back any more? Because I don't just put
[01:56:32.540 --> 01:56:37.860]  a pretty face on this or perfume on a pig, I see this blowing up in their face. I see
[01:56:37.860 --> 01:56:43.420]  this actually waking people up. It is waking people up, whether or not it
[01:56:43.420 --> 01:56:48.960]  wakes up anybody in Congress willing to take them to task or cut funding, that remains
[01:56:48.960 --> 01:56:55.140]  a very big question. The difficulty in even cutting funding to Obamacare, our Republicans
[01:56:55.140 --> 01:57:02.200]  sabotaged that and funded it. I don't think there's enough strength to actually cut funding
[01:57:02.200 --> 01:57:08.820]  to DHS. They bring out the idea that we're helping the terrorists if we cut funding to
[01:57:08.820 --> 01:57:13.700]  DHS. We're a long way from winning this battle, even with the amount of backlash that we're
[01:57:13.700 --> 01:57:18.220]  engendering right now. We have to keep it up. We have to put the heat on Congress. But
[01:57:18.220 --> 01:57:24.420]  it should be half of Congress demanding an answer from DHS, not just 15 Congressmen.
[01:57:24.420 --> 01:57:28.680]  But it is a victory that we've gone from them stonewalling to now it being forced out into
[01:57:28.680 --> 01:57:32.900]  a national debate. Absolutely. It's still not a national debate
[01:57:32.900 --> 01:57:38.300]  yet, but they're putting heat on them and so far they're stonewalling still.
[01:57:38.300 --> 01:57:43.900]  Well, you're right. I mean, it's somewhat of a national debate, but it really needs
[01:57:43.900 --> 01:57:49.420]  to become one on a full scale because then it will bring us back to the common sense
[01:57:49.420 --> 01:57:55.920]  of why we have a Second Amendment. Well, whenever the media, with this much notoriety
[01:57:55.920 --> 01:58:01.500]  about this with Breitbart and your website and everybody else talking about it, my website,
[01:58:01.500 --> 01:58:07.040]  they're not saying a thing about the 3 billion bullets or the 2.1.6. And that means there's
[01:58:07.040 --> 01:58:11.620]  a cover up. They basically want this buried. No, but you're right. It's well over 2 billion
[01:58:11.620 --> 01:58:16.780]  now. And if you count all the other stockpiles by well over 3 billion that they've gotten
[01:58:16.780 --> 01:58:20.340]  delivered or that have been ordered. I want to come back briefly and talk more
[01:58:20.340 --> 01:58:24.420]  about the economy with you. And then at the 8 after when we come back in that next segment,
[01:58:24.420 --> 01:58:29.340]  we're going with Joel Scales and to get into his plane crash that he survived by the grace
[01:58:29.340 --> 01:58:33.580]  of God. Pretty amazing. If you haven't seen the news, but it's just Google Joel Scales
[01:58:33.580 --> 01:58:37.420]  in and collect news. You can see it if you're a radio listener. We'll be right back with

[02:00:05.100 --> 02:00:12.540]  Big Brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups. You want answers? Well so does
[02:00:12.540 --> 02:00:20.220]  he. He's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas
[02:00:20.220 --> 02:00:26.900]  Alex Jones. Joel Skalzen of World Affairs Brief is our guest for the 20-30 minutes.
[02:00:26.900 --> 02:00:31.180]  I always enjoy talking to him and going back and forth. Some of your phone calls coming up.
[02:00:31.180 --> 02:00:37.140]  Joel I briefly wanted to ask you, we sell a video after the tribulation that's got
[02:00:37.140 --> 02:00:40.900]  a bunch of different pastors you know on there breaking down with the Bible
[02:00:40.900 --> 02:00:45.420]  clearly says the rapture happens after the Antichrist is defeated. I was just
[02:00:45.420 --> 02:00:49.540]  curious what your take on this is and and and just guessing as I don't know
[02:00:49.540 --> 02:00:56.420]  your view on it. What do you make of how this is used regardless as a cop-out for
[02:00:56.420 --> 02:00:59.620]  Christians who never fight evil because the end of the world is always around
[02:00:59.620 --> 02:01:03.940]  the corner. I think more and more you know the fact that you know Christians
[02:01:03.940 --> 02:01:07.380]  across this country think that God's gonna handle it all that's the main
[02:01:07.380 --> 02:01:10.060]  reason they won't ever stand up against the total takeover because they think
[02:01:10.060 --> 02:01:14.740]  the end of the world's next week. Well I agree this is a problem is something
[02:01:14.740 --> 02:01:20.780]  that you know I struggle with a lot of my Christian friends who have that you
[02:01:20.780 --> 02:01:25.660]  know kind of a benign benevolent apathy that God's in charge and therefore we
[02:01:25.660 --> 02:01:30.060]  don't have to worry. Well you may not have to worry about your salvation if
[02:01:30.060 --> 02:01:34.060]  you're born again if you're committed to Christ but you will fear in the last
[02:01:34.060 --> 02:01:39.580]  days because I'm a belief that there's never been any time in history that God
[02:01:39.580 --> 02:01:46.180]  has not put his own people through the fire of adversity in order to strengthen
[02:01:46.180 --> 02:01:51.300]  them to make them stronger. This earth is a test life it's to test ourselves to
[02:01:51.300 --> 02:01:56.740]  see how we will you know respond to this the promptings of the spirit of Wars as
[02:01:56.740 --> 02:02:02.060]  it guides us through difficult times and I personally think that we're gonna go
[02:02:02.060 --> 02:02:06.820]  through the tribulation I don't believe in the Cadillac Rapture that saves us
[02:02:06.820 --> 02:02:11.300]  while we're still in good times and in the freeway I think prior to the second
[02:02:11.300 --> 02:02:17.680]  coming which I do believe in I believe prior to the second coming people on the
[02:02:17.680 --> 02:02:20.820]  earth will be crying crying day and night for deliverance that there would
[02:02:20.820 --> 02:02:25.820]  be war upon this planet and only the intervention of God sending his son
[02:02:25.820 --> 02:02:31.740]  again the second time will stop Satan's wholesale control of the world. So how
[02:02:31.740 --> 02:02:34.660]  does it work they stage a nuclear war and then the Anglo-American
[02:02:34.660 --> 02:02:39.140]  establishment takes tries to take over the planet with the Antichrist? Yes I
[02:02:39.140 --> 02:02:43.260]  believe that they're gonna come out of their bunkers after this war starts with
[02:02:43.260 --> 02:02:46.940]  a nuclear strike on military targets and they're gonna say you know the Russians
[02:02:46.940 --> 02:02:50.620]  and Chinese deceived us we didn't know this was coming that's a lie of course
[02:02:50.620 --> 02:02:56.820]  but sometimes and they'll say the only way to save ourselves now is to to join
[02:02:56.820 --> 02:03:00.660]  in a militarized New World Order with the League of Democracies or some of the
[02:03:00.660 --> 02:03:05.540]  new euphemistic sounding name for United Nations. NATO will probably become the
[02:03:05.540 --> 02:03:09.500]  shock troops of the United Nations will bring out our secret weapon systems that
[02:03:09.500 --> 02:03:13.460]  we've been developing not use them to protect the United States but use them
[02:03:13.460 --> 02:03:19.540]  to militarize this world army and during this war I think you'll see the
[02:03:19.540 --> 02:03:22.540]  government turn on its own people and say you know there are people among us
[02:03:22.540 --> 02:03:26.060]  that are not supporting this war not supporting our troops that complain that
[02:03:26.060 --> 02:03:29.340]  we the government knew this was happening that we're part of the problem
[02:03:29.340 --> 02:03:34.020]  those people need to be rounded up and we call upon all Americans. No exactly the
[02:03:34.020 --> 02:03:37.740]  New World Order will use it to go after their own domestic groups that that
[02:03:37.740 --> 02:03:41.160]  aren't evil and they'll use it to take over the planet that's exactly what they
[02:03:41.160 --> 02:03:45.900]  do. That's right and at some point you know it ends up with a battle of
[02:03:45.900 --> 02:03:49.420]  Armageddon there's going to be a major conflict in the Middle East that will
[02:03:49.420 --> 02:03:53.220]  and I don't think the current conflict even the attack on Iran will lead
[02:03:53.220 --> 02:03:57.580]  directly to World War three I think North Korea is being preserved as the
[02:03:57.580 --> 02:04:02.960]  trigger event for that war and that China and Russia aren't ready yet and so
[02:04:02.960 --> 02:04:07.100]  I think but but one thing that the further intervention in the Middle East
[02:04:07.100 --> 02:04:11.780]  will do as it's being done here in Syria and then Iran it will solidify our
[02:04:11.780 --> 02:04:16.140]  reputation as the bully of the world handing to Russia and China the excuse
[02:04:16.140 --> 02:04:21.900]  to attack the West someday. You know what really why I know God's real and all
[02:04:21.900 --> 02:04:25.260]  this is real not just personal experiences and discernment when I study
[02:04:25.260 --> 02:04:30.540]  the globalist they are all at the final equation Luciferians. Well how is there
[02:04:30.540 --> 02:04:34.620]  not a Lucifer if the establishment wants us to be atheists so we don't even know
[02:04:34.620 --> 02:04:39.180]  this games going on and then the top people they know Lucifer's in charge
[02:04:39.180 --> 02:04:42.700]  they believe Lucifer's given them power all these globalists when you really
[02:04:42.700 --> 02:04:48.540]  look into what they believe they think they've been given power by Lucifer it's
[02:04:48.540 --> 02:04:52.780]  amazing. We'll be right back ladies and gentlemen after this quick break with

[02:08:19.540 --> 02:08:22.740]  know the two Texas state troopers that pulled over the two attractive young
[02:08:22.740 --> 02:08:27.740]  women and use the same glove to on video go inside their bodies they're been
[02:08:27.740 --> 02:08:34.780]  indicted by the grand jury the state police commandant and the the the local
[02:08:34.780 --> 02:08:40.420]  commanders all endorsed this and said no we're now gonna use the same glove and
[02:08:40.420 --> 02:08:44.620]  and violate you without a warrant but the grand jury up in North Texas is
[02:08:44.620 --> 02:08:49.420]  indicting them see we have the jury box the grand jury box the jury box we have
[02:08:49.420 --> 02:08:53.500]  the cartridge box as well I don't want to go there we have the pin which is
[02:08:53.500 --> 02:08:56.980]  mindier than the sword and the average police aren't even bad they're trying to
[02:08:56.980 --> 02:09:01.060]  find bad ones there's a real fight going on for the heart and soul of humanity
[02:09:01.060 --> 02:09:06.940]  right now and I've had success in my own life fighting tyranny so I know you can
[02:09:06.940 --> 02:09:11.340]  have success Lord knows I mean my attempts to fight tyranny or ham-fisted
[02:09:11.340 --> 02:09:15.700]  and and and you know downright obnoxious looking at times but you know what my
[02:09:15.700 --> 02:09:20.640]  heart is good I'm really trying to do good and it's had a great effect and the
[02:09:20.640 --> 02:09:24.860]  same thing for you out there this is an incredible life and people are so
[02:09:24.860 --> 02:09:30.100]  unchallenged out there especially young people now they don't believe you know
[02:09:30.100 --> 02:09:34.540]  that I was able to sneak in Bohemian Grove or cover military drills or you
[02:09:34.540 --> 02:09:38.620]  know have big effects or help defeat legislation it just must all be fake
[02:09:38.620 --> 02:09:42.820]  because everything's fake no it's not fake there's different forces at work in
[02:09:42.820 --> 02:09:46.940]  this world take Joel Skousen you know his uncle helped expose how the mega
[02:09:46.940 --> 02:09:50.140]  rich were funding communism he got laughed at at the time now it's well
[02:09:50.140 --> 02:09:55.140]  known take Joel Skousen you know went off joined the Marines as a fighter
[02:09:55.140 --> 02:09:59.180]  bomber pilot landing on aircraft carriers I can't imagine if people know
[02:09:59.180 --> 02:10:05.580]  how hard and dangerous that is and like you know just what a balancing act it is
[02:10:05.580 --> 02:10:09.900]  for people that can't even believe that I could sneak in Bohemian Grove when it
[02:10:09.900 --> 02:10:14.500]  was a piece of cake past the Secret Service it's just this idea that less
[02:10:14.500 --> 02:10:20.180]  and less are people actual doers on the field it is a culture of spectators
[02:10:20.180 --> 02:10:23.980]  where they just think government is God and can do whatever it wants now that
[02:10:23.980 --> 02:10:28.620]  said I won't take a few calls for Joel Skousen here until the bottom of the

[02:11:37.140 --> 02:11:42.180]  bank bailout again this is all happening and our news won't even say it's that
[02:11:42.180 --> 02:11:46.300]  they're taking money they just call it a bailout so you know Cyprus is happy
[02:11:46.300 --> 02:11:50.860]  they've gotten their bailout now now Joel I'll take a few phone calls here
[02:11:50.860 --> 02:11:56.980]  for you today but first off you were on with us about a week and a half ago it
[02:11:56.980 --> 02:12:01.500]  didn't even tell us that a day or two before you had what the local news and
[02:12:01.500 --> 02:12:08.060]  the FAA and the police called miraculous and you know you just talked about the
[02:12:08.060 --> 02:12:11.620]  Russian oligarch saying that was a killing I agree with you and I know
[02:12:11.620 --> 02:12:16.100]  you're not a paranoid type guy and I mean perhaps this can happen on the type
[02:12:16.100 --> 02:12:19.220]  of aircraft you were flying with tell us about the aircraft where it happened
[02:12:19.220 --> 02:12:25.420]  what happened and just I mean I saw a lot of aviation sites saying that this
[02:12:25.420 --> 02:12:31.540]  is one in a hundred that you survived plus you barely even got a scratch that's
[02:12:31.540 --> 02:12:36.020]  right Alex you know when you train both in the military and facility and flying
[02:12:36.020 --> 02:12:39.980]  you all your worst nightmare is an engine quitting and having to put it
[02:12:39.980 --> 02:12:44.900]  down in a field somewhere I had trained for years on this it finally happened to
[02:12:44.900 --> 02:12:52.460]  me I was about 12 miles away from my home airport and the engine started to
[02:12:52.460 --> 02:12:58.380]  falter I turned on the low boost pump to try to get fuel to the engine having had
[02:12:58.380 --> 02:13:02.780]  some fuel clogging in one other instance with this airplane normally the low
[02:13:02.780 --> 02:13:07.700]  boost pump fixed it it did not in this case I turned on the emergency high
[02:13:07.700 --> 02:13:13.980]  boost pump and the engine came back to life and ran fine I got into the traffic
[02:13:13.980 --> 02:13:18.460]  pattern of the airport I pulled power back in order to slow down it's a 200
[02:13:18.460 --> 02:13:24.740]  mile an hour retractable airplane pretty fast small experimental fiberglass sleek
[02:13:24.740 --> 02:13:29.620]  airplane so it's not easy to slow down unless you pull power put down the
[02:13:29.620 --> 02:13:33.080]  landing gear and the flaps and went to put power back on the airplane to
[02:13:33.080 --> 02:13:37.820]  maintain altitude in it and nothing happened the airplane engine just
[02:13:37.820 --> 02:13:45.660]  windmilled and after about 20 seconds analyzing and heading to the airport
[02:13:45.660 --> 02:13:49.740]  trying to get my machine back online checking pumps and fuel position
[02:13:49.740 --> 02:13:54.980]  indicators I it became obvious I wasn't gonna make the field lots of cars and
[02:13:54.980 --> 02:14:02.060]  people in front of me and so I turned left into the farming area and prepared
[02:14:02.060 --> 02:14:07.580]  to make an emergency landing I had read an article not two weeks before and one
[02:14:07.580 --> 02:14:12.620]  of my flying magazines about a highly decorated Navy pilot who had killed
[02:14:12.620 --> 02:14:16.980]  himself because he had not maintained airspeed and had stalled and spun into
[02:14:16.980 --> 02:14:22.140]  the ground and so that was fresh in my mind I made sure don't get slow don't
[02:14:22.140 --> 02:14:30.460]  get slow and I kept my speed up I as I was getting ready to touch down I began
[02:14:30.460 --> 02:14:35.180]  to tumble when I hit first and I knew this was gonna be very bad within a
[02:14:35.180 --> 02:14:41.220]  second and a half it was all over I was sitting in the middle of the wreckage on
[02:14:41.220 --> 02:14:44.820]  the wing that had broken off from the airplane the airplane was cracked in
[02:14:44.820 --> 02:14:49.820]  half shards of plexiglass all around I stepped out on the ground and I was
[02:14:49.820 --> 02:14:56.180]  whole I had nothing wrong with me I was just amazing if not more so because in
[02:14:56.180 --> 02:15:02.540]  the first impact my seat belt broke that's a 2,000 pound seat belt and it
[02:15:02.540 --> 02:15:08.780]  broke and I didn't hit anything in that cockpit it was a miracle now that is
[02:15:08.780 --> 02:15:16.820]  miraculous that really is miraculous how many times did the plane flip well it
[02:15:16.820 --> 02:15:21.700]  cartwheeled approximately a tie a time and a half the wings as I say broke
[02:15:21.700 --> 02:15:25.300]  apart from the fuselage the fuselage broke in half in fact if it hadn't
[02:15:25.300 --> 02:15:30.420]  broken in half I would have had trouble unjamming and opening the canopy to get
[02:15:30.420 --> 02:15:34.620]  out of the aircraft but because it broke in half I was able to just step out on
[02:15:34.620 --> 02:15:39.780]  the ground but as I say when you break the seat belt it means you are being
[02:15:39.780 --> 02:15:44.500]  ejected from the airplane and the seat belt did broke break but not only was I
[02:15:44.500 --> 02:15:49.580]  not ejected my glasses were 200 feet away but I stayed in the cockpit and
[02:15:49.580 --> 02:15:53.460]  didn't hit anything and that's just I don't have any explanation other than
[02:15:53.460 --> 02:15:58.700]  some kind of angelic airbags I was about to say did you see you're guarding an
[02:15:58.700 --> 02:16:05.980]  angel there well my life didn't flash before me I guess I'm needed to stick
[02:16:05.980 --> 02:16:11.900]  around for a while what type of I mean it's a neat-looking little aircraft what
[02:16:11.900 --> 02:16:17.340]  type of aircraft was it it's a glass air aircraft it's a 200 mile an hour
[02:16:17.340 --> 02:16:22.660]  experimental aircraft retractable gear very fast and that's what you fly around
[02:16:22.660 --> 02:16:26.900]  advising on secure homes around the country that's right I'm traveling all
[02:16:26.900 --> 02:16:31.660]  of the time because I'm busy not only in my world affairs brief as editor but
[02:16:31.660 --> 02:16:36.380]  consulting with people and designing high-security residences retreats for
[02:16:36.380 --> 02:16:40.380]  people and you know the airplane keeps me from having to deal with TSA all the
[02:16:40.380 --> 02:16:47.220]  time it's a great asset but I tell you what's amazing is that you came on what
[02:16:47.220 --> 02:16:50.660]  on my show what a day and a half and then didn't even tell us it was like it
[02:16:50.660 --> 02:16:59.140]  was no big deal well it was a bigger deal to my wife certainly who who was in
[02:16:59.140 --> 02:17:05.660]  shock for two days but you know I was okay I thank the Lord profusely but I
[02:17:05.660 --> 02:17:10.740]  moved on and of course I've been dealing with the FAA an accident investigation
[02:17:10.740 --> 02:17:15.300]  and all those types of things since but I certainly didn't feel like I needed to
[02:17:15.300 --> 02:17:18.660]  advertise that I'd been in an accident I did get quite a bit of notoriety
[02:17:18.660 --> 02:17:25.580]  nationwide survivalist survives airplane crash ha ha ha man I tell you by the
[02:17:25.580 --> 02:17:29.660]  grace of God expanding on that because I know that the quote authorities were
[02:17:29.660 --> 02:17:36.100]  amazed at first what are they saying now about I mean I I believed just because I
[02:17:36.100 --> 02:17:42.620]  saw you on TV with a small scratch in your nose was that already there no no I
[02:17:42.620 --> 02:17:49.260]  did have a a couple of small scratches and I had a bruise for the seat belt was
[02:17:49.260 --> 02:17:54.100]  where I broke the seat belt it obviously bruised me I didn't feel any of that the

[02:19:04.460 --> 02:19:07.820]  I had a near miss myself where I lost power on approach to an aircraft
[02:19:07.820 --> 02:19:11.900]  carrier and actually went down below the deck of the level before the engine
[02:19:11.900 --> 02:19:16.260]  caught and finally came back up it was very dramatic to see on the video camera
[02:19:16.260 --> 02:19:20.460]  afterwards everyone thought I was lost in fact yeah we had dinner once he told
[02:19:20.460 --> 02:19:23.940]  me that story in fact I think they said that was miraculous from all the things

[02:24:42.740 --> 02:24:45.980]  about that and I'm gonna ask him one other question about what are they gonna

[02:25:21.220 --> 02:25:29.180]  for being alive my friend that was crazy story just oh yeah I have a question
[02:25:29.180 --> 02:25:35.220]  with well I say it's both for you and Alice actually with all of the class
[02:25:35.220 --> 02:25:41.220]  action suits going on is it better a to go with the class action suits or to
[02:25:41.220 --> 02:25:47.540]  sue personal first of all you're talking about suing who I'm talking about such
[02:25:47.540 --> 02:25:52.580]  as like the fluoride and I'm not getting any of this audio oh I'm sorry we'll
[02:25:52.580 --> 02:25:58.020]  we'll send you audio caller I all right appreciate your call will relay relay
[02:25:58.020 --> 02:26:03.700]  that over to you he was asking what about lawsuits against government when
[02:26:03.700 --> 02:26:07.540]  they're doing corrupt things our class action lawsuits good or individual
[02:26:07.540 --> 02:26:11.660]  lawsuits what's your view on leave on legal maneuvers like suing in New York
[02:26:11.660 --> 02:26:17.060]  to block the the assault weapons ban of the ammo ban that's actually having some
[02:26:17.060 --> 02:26:23.100]  success what's your view very rarely will the courts respond positively to
[02:26:23.100 --> 02:26:26.860]  and if it's a matter of clear constitutional interpretation they'll
[02:26:26.860 --> 02:26:33.020]  usually even refuse to take the case or they'll overturn it on appeal the courts
[02:26:33.020 --> 02:26:37.260]  are very controlled nothing is more telling for example than William Griggs
[02:26:37.260 --> 02:26:41.220]  blog freedom in our time where he documents all of the times that people
[02:26:41.220 --> 02:26:45.900]  have taken the cops to court for abuse or for violating their fundamental
[02:26:45.900 --> 02:26:51.740]  rights and only about 1% of the time will judges uphold a victim against the
[02:26:51.740 --> 02:26:58.060]  police so I have very little confidence that that that will work is that why the
[02:26:58.060 --> 02:27:02.500]  police on average a lot of them are actually good men and women I found but
[02:27:02.500 --> 02:27:06.420]  but they've made such a hero psychology out of it that you're an enemy if you
[02:27:06.420 --> 02:27:09.540]  don't do whatever the police want and I mean in some cities the police are
[02:27:09.540 --> 02:27:15.060]  downright criminal organizations well that's absolutely true Alex and I think
[02:27:15.060 --> 02:27:18.660]  more and more the good people in the police are being pushed out and retired
[02:27:18.660 --> 02:27:23.980]  there that's what this entire mercenary system has been about hiring mercenaries
[02:27:23.980 --> 02:27:28.300]  at ten times the cost of soldiers they're vetting they're seeing who is
[02:27:28.300 --> 02:27:33.380]  unprincipled they're training and and hiring people for the dark side of
[02:27:33.380 --> 02:27:38.980]  government cadre leaders yes it's incredible and the stories you told me
[02:27:38.980 --> 02:27:43.260]  about family you know an FBI CIA how they try to get them to be corrupt if
[02:27:43.260 --> 02:27:46.300]  they're not corrupt you know they stay at a low level it's like this army
[02:27:46.300 --> 02:27:49.220]  captain people say well 20 years the army why was the only a captain you
[02:27:49.220 --> 02:27:52.780]  know combat veteran all this stuff and now he's speaking out against Obama well
[02:27:52.780 --> 02:27:57.620]  I mean that's not a sign of being bad that you didn't get promoted it's a sign
[02:27:57.620 --> 02:28:02.980]  that you're good and in fact anyone who gets to be the highest ranks in the
[02:28:02.980 --> 02:28:07.900]  military has to be a yes man the the two the one general and one Admiral that
[02:28:07.900 --> 02:28:11.820]  were relieved for standing down or for refusing to stand down during the
[02:28:11.820 --> 02:28:16.860]  Benghazi raid were in fact exceptions to the rule most people would have got
[02:28:16.860 --> 02:28:20.820]  along they did not go along so it shows that even though they've been yes men
[02:28:20.820 --> 02:28:24.660]  and to a certain point sometimes they have a line in the sand they will not
[02:28:24.660 --> 02:28:28.940]  cross and have to be removed and they had to be silenced as well sure Fox
[02:28:28.940 --> 02:28:32.820]  Fallon wouldn't attack Iran they remove what four heads of CENTCOM the last
[02:28:32.820 --> 02:28:36.420]  seven eight years and and it shows yeah they were yes men to a point but now
[02:28:36.420 --> 02:28:40.860]  what they're being asked to do is so flagrantly criminal that they're not
[02:28:40.860 --> 02:28:44.860]  doing it in fact it's now come out Fox Fallon would not launch a fake attack on
[02:28:44.860 --> 02:28:49.020]  one of his destroyers with Navy SEALs of sigh hearse brought that out imagine
[02:28:49.020 --> 02:28:54.260]  being asked to kill your own people and blame it on somebody that's right and so
[02:28:54.260 --> 02:28:58.180]  that's what they deal with and that proves my point that everybody who does
[02:28:58.180 --> 02:29:02.820]  the bidding of the the globalist isn't necessarily a conspirator there's a lot
[02:29:02.820 --> 02:29:07.020]  of yesmanship there's a lot of predictability they depend upon and then
[02:29:07.020 --> 02:29:11.380]  there's there's subtle threats there's giving them false reasons you know
[02:29:11.380 --> 02:29:14.420]  there's a control system but it's beneficial people need to be controlled
[02:29:14.420 --> 02:29:19.940]  but at some point as this gets worse as you have said today we're going to be
[02:29:19.940 --> 02:29:23.980]  proven right and they've got to deal with that the fact that a lot of people
[02:29:23.980 --> 02:29:29.580]  will see conspiracy really does exist to take away Liberty Joel Skousins our

[02:33:46.060 --> 02:33:49.660]  to those five or six calls but Joel Skousen again if you're just joining us
[02:33:49.660 --> 02:33:55.260]  Alex Jones here back live thank you for joining us Joel looking at this the
[02:33:55.260 --> 02:34:02.860]  rat the the mad dash the Holy Grail by the establishment in MIT publications
[02:34:02.860 --> 02:34:06.420]  DARPA publications everywhere is that the elite are gonna have a singularity
[02:34:06.420 --> 02:34:11.260]  by 2025 now the media always covers this and says that I believe this I'm not
[02:34:11.260 --> 02:34:16.420]  saying this not just Ray Kurzweil but the UN all of them at the highest levels
[02:34:16.420 --> 02:34:21.380]  they believe that they're gonna merge with machines and live forever and
[02:34:21.380 --> 02:34:26.060]  become godlike totally delusional some of their forebears and the eugenics
[02:34:26.060 --> 02:34:28.940]  intermarried in her bread thing it would create God men and it created
[02:34:28.940 --> 02:34:32.900]  stillborn children if you look at the Hugsley's in the wedge woods and the
[02:34:32.900 --> 02:34:36.780]  Darwin's and the Galtons and others 150 years ago in England but they're the
[02:34:36.780 --> 02:34:41.940]  progenitors of all this and now today they say we're gonna have all drones
[02:34:41.940 --> 02:34:45.380]  which will be but choosing their own targets in fact the British in the US
[02:34:45.380 --> 02:34:49.180]  already have autonomous drones we're gonna have robots that work on robots
[02:34:49.180 --> 02:34:53.300]  Foxconn's already rolling out a million of those in China they say humans won't
[02:34:53.300 --> 02:34:57.460]  matter and we're going to have you know say a swarm of a thousand little robots
[02:34:57.460 --> 02:35:02.620]  that come in your house and and and you know basically poison you now they're
[02:35:02.620 --> 02:35:07.340]  moving in that direction undoubtedly they're moving towards a Skynet system
[02:35:07.340 --> 02:35:11.900]  where it's not machines going after humanity but humans the technocrats as
[02:35:11.900 --> 02:35:16.140]  they call fancy themselves going after us so as a military guy military
[02:35:16.140 --> 02:35:19.980]  historian researcher who's looked at all this I've never heard you speak to it I
[02:35:19.980 --> 02:35:23.860]  may have missed articles you've written what is your take on the globalist and
[02:35:23.860 --> 02:35:28.700]  their pipe dreams and their technocracy and where you see all that going Joel
[02:35:28.700 --> 02:35:35.700]  Skousen it's it's hard to say Alex the they're always thinking ahead you know
[02:35:35.700 --> 02:35:40.220]  we have to remember as you have said many times as dr. Stan Monteitha said
[02:35:40.220 --> 02:35:44.860]  this is a satanic conspiracy at the core it's the only thing that explains this
[02:35:44.860 --> 02:35:49.740]  generational effect why this goes on century after century in a seamless
[02:35:49.740 --> 02:35:55.580]  manner no single evil individual capable of keeping something a conspiracy going
[02:35:55.580 --> 02:36:01.820]  for three generations let alone 10 or 12 or longer but the key to how this
[02:36:01.820 --> 02:36:07.820]  operates is this form of immunity and I've hypothesized that not only does the
[02:36:07.820 --> 02:36:11.300]  conspiracy promise immunity on earth against judgment and that's why they
[02:36:11.300 --> 02:36:16.100]  have to control the courts but it also promises immunity from God's judgment
[02:36:16.100 --> 02:36:20.580]  and that's what this quest for immortality is all about you know it's
[02:36:20.580 --> 02:36:25.820]  part of the the facade that you can live forever without God without the
[02:36:25.820 --> 02:36:30.500]  resurrection without the atonement without Jesus Christ and I don't think
[02:36:30.500 --> 02:36:33.380]  they'll ever get to that I don't think it's possible I think it's a violation
[02:36:33.380 --> 02:36:39.540]  of the the limitations of physics that the God places upon the earth I mean
[02:36:39.540 --> 02:36:42.700]  obviously he doesn't restrict himself to the speed of light he can make
[02:36:42.700 --> 02:36:47.180]  right-angle turns at hyper speed but human beings can't and I think there's
[02:36:47.180 --> 02:36:51.980]  certain limitations about this testing portion of the planet that man no matter
[02:36:51.980 --> 02:36:56.420]  what they're promised by Satan won't be able to do but they will try and I know
[02:36:56.420 --> 02:37:00.300]  that eugenics is part of that they are going to use war and other biological
[02:37:00.300 --> 02:37:06.380]  chemical weapons vaccines and other things to destroy a lot of people but we
[02:37:06.380 --> 02:37:11.700]  do have the ability of God to guide us and direct us and help us there will be
[02:37:11.700 --> 02:37:15.940]  a remnant preserved we will be able to fight back that's part of the test on
[02:37:15.940 --> 02:37:20.020]  earth this is not a hopeless situation no matter how much power that they have
[02:37:20.020 --> 02:37:25.900]  so while I don't and cannot project if they're going to get as many of these
[02:37:25.900 --> 02:37:32.460]  super weapons or life that they I doubt it frankly I think that ultimately God's
[02:37:32.460 --> 02:37:36.500]  going to support that and going to help us to a certain extent to be able to
[02:37:36.500 --> 02:37:43.580]  share how does a human intellect control super AI computers to begin with if they
[02:37:43.580 --> 02:37:46.540]  ever even achieve that I mean how they think they're going to be able to even
[02:37:46.540 --> 02:37:51.780]  interpret all the data that the machine is is engaged in and if it isn't quote
[02:37:51.780 --> 02:37:56.220]  an evil computer it might be totally logical if they ever created AI machines
[02:37:56.220 --> 02:38:00.780]  they would probably wipe out the globalist and they might not be able to
[02:38:00.780 --> 02:38:06.160]  control them that's right so I think though that they will get and that's the
[02:38:06.160 --> 02:38:09.940]  purpose of the drones that's the purpose of not only for surveillance but to be
[02:38:09.940 --> 02:38:14.500]  able to target people without the influence of conscience that affects
[02:38:14.500 --> 02:38:20.300]  everybody including evil people they are being convicted of what they're doing as
[02:38:20.300 --> 02:38:24.020]  they do it and they will be held accountable someday and they want to
[02:38:24.020 --> 02:38:28.140]  avoid that accountability they want to avoid that conflict of conscience that
[02:38:28.140 --> 02:38:32.700]  occurs it happened in Bosnia with the Air Force pilot it refused you know to
[02:38:32.700 --> 02:38:38.340]  fire on this civilian convoy that was down there it happens even less now with
[02:38:38.340 --> 02:38:42.700]  the drones because the the guys operating the joysticks at Creek area
[02:38:42.700 --> 02:38:47.340]  Creech Air Force Base in Nevada don't have the same connection with their
[02:38:47.340 --> 02:38:50.980]  targets and if you notice the media talks about how they're such heroes and
[02:38:50.980 --> 02:38:56.060]  they were giving a medals above Purple Hearts and and then Lindsey Graham the
[02:38:56.060 --> 02:39:02.380]  senator said we're not the SS you know when we do it it's good but then you
[02:39:02.380 --> 02:39:05.860]  hear the whole culture now let's kill those you know you know those Arabs
[02:39:05.860 --> 02:39:12.460]  those you know what's those sand inwards it just really is sick and yes
[02:39:12.460 --> 02:39:18.700]  absolutely the targeting of civilians is just a terrible thing and they're
[02:39:18.700 --> 02:39:24.380]  trying to take our humanity away from us which they cannot do and so they're
[02:39:24.380 --> 02:39:28.580]  trying to evade the humanity the the influence of conscience that works on
[02:39:28.580 --> 02:39:36.820]  people and and that's that's the issue while his Skype is reconnecting there
[02:39:36.820 --> 02:39:40.140]  we've had more problem with Skype then we've ever have it that's okay because
[02:39:40.140 --> 02:39:43.580]  the quality is a little bit better for radio listeners Skype gives you better
[02:39:43.580 --> 02:39:48.580]  audio but most the time but it also gives you video and that's why we have
[02:39:48.580 --> 02:39:54.260]  the TV portion of the transmission at prison planet TV Joel as we if you take
[02:39:54.260 --> 02:39:59.820]  a few final calls here we didn't get much into combat in Vietnam but I mean
[02:39:59.820 --> 02:40:04.420]  I think you told me about the stress of pilots after long missions coming in at
[02:40:04.420 --> 02:40:08.660]  night in bad weather or whatever having to pry people out of the planes but I
[02:40:08.660 --> 02:40:13.260]  mean did you ever have issues with targets where or did you ever see people
[02:40:13.260 --> 02:40:17.260]  not not go after already pre-marked targets if it was clear that civilians
[02:40:17.260 --> 02:40:23.540]  were there well you know I my squadron just came back from Vietnam when I'm
[02:40:23.540 --> 02:40:27.620]  joined it so I actually did not see combat in but I did talk to many of them
[02:40:27.620 --> 02:40:33.660]  about their their situation and yes they did have problems with with targeting
[02:40:33.660 --> 02:40:36.820]  though it's very difficult from a fast-moving fighter jet to be able to
[02:40:36.820 --> 02:40:40.500]  determine whether they're civilians or whether or not they're bad guys you know
[02:40:40.500 --> 02:40:45.860]  scurrying out of the buildings but clearly there were a few situations when
[02:40:45.860 --> 02:40:50.340]  they rejected targets and actually did not drop on targets that looked like
[02:40:50.340 --> 02:40:55.980]  they were mostly women and children and that's what's interesting now because
[02:40:55.980 --> 02:41:00.380]  the first time they did target men women and children was World War two Hitler
[02:41:00.380 --> 02:41:04.100]  bad guy obviously but did not target London because he didn't want to kill
[02:41:04.100 --> 02:41:08.140]  men women children so the United States in England launched attacks actually
[02:41:08.140 --> 02:41:12.420]  England it at first to bomb civilian targets to trick Hitler into attacking
[02:41:12.420 --> 02:41:17.100]  civilians to unify them and then that's how that unrestricted warfare it's
[02:41:17.100 --> 02:41:20.500]  really a war crime got started I've heard limbaugh say you know part of war
[02:41:20.500 --> 02:41:24.140]  is killing civilians we want to create terror of course he's never been in the
[02:41:24.140 --> 02:41:26.900]  military he's never studied history I don't think or he wouldn't make a
[02:41:26.900 --> 02:41:30.700]  statement like that but this idea that hey it's okay to kill 200 innocent
[02:41:30.700 --> 02:41:35.140]  people as long as we get one bad guy they claim and call it collateral damage
[02:41:35.140 --> 02:41:38.740]  well that shows you they're not really concerned about dead kids at Sandy Hook
[02:41:38.740 --> 02:41:43.060]  or they'd be crying about villages of dead children in Afghanistan plus even
[02:41:43.060 --> 02:41:46.620]  if you're mean you don't want to kill villages of kids it turns everybody
[02:41:46.620 --> 02:41:51.140]  against you a hundred and ten percent if you're trying to occupy someplace you do
[02:41:51.140 --> 02:41:55.120]  not want to kill children do you well that's right and that's why you know
[02:41:55.120 --> 02:41:58.340]  historically even the most evil criminals have never gone into
[02:41:58.340 --> 02:42:02.300]  kindergartens and killed people only people that are mind-controlled or
[02:42:02.300 --> 02:42:07.980]  hypnotized or in some way drugged up or in combination of all those three are
[02:42:07.980 --> 02:42:10.940]  capable of doing the crimes of Sandy Hook and that's why I'm absolutely
[02:42:10.940 --> 02:42:16.540]  convinced that was a government crime putting people up to it no no I you know
[02:42:16.540 --> 02:42:19.180]  I really respect your view and I read your site all the time and have you on
[02:42:19.180 --> 02:42:22.940]  but I've just been so busy I hadn't looked into your view all I know is this
[02:42:22.940 --> 02:42:27.660]  Aurora and remember they did fast and furious which is a false flag they're
[02:42:27.660 --> 02:42:31.220]  capable of anything as Larry Pratt has said head of Gunners of America but you
[02:42:31.220 --> 02:42:35.540]  look at Aurora there's no doubt he's in a DARPA program 30-something thousand a
[02:42:35.540 --> 02:42:40.700]  year high-level Air Force psychiatrist attached to him the DARPA program is in
[02:42:40.700 --> 02:42:45.980]  a mind-brain interface with computers it's a mind-control area he's on seven
[02:42:45.980 --> 02:42:50.820]  drugs he says I'm under mind control at the jail then they cover that up and now
[02:42:50.820 --> 02:42:55.260]  they're gonna drug him with with with truth serum which if you're under
[02:42:55.260 --> 02:42:58.500]  mind-control for those that don't know they use that in mind control to quote
[02:42:58.500 --> 02:43:02.180]  make him tell the truth at trial I mean this is amazing and then you look at
[02:43:02.180 --> 02:43:07.140]  Sandy Hook it's got all the same signs Joel give us your take on that well I
[02:43:07.140 --> 02:43:12.300]  knew something was up when Holmes as soon as he was taken into custody the
[02:43:12.300 --> 02:43:15.900]  one thing the police let through was his psychiatrist to give him his meds and
[02:43:15.900 --> 02:43:20.340]  that means that they realized he was starting to talk out of school once
[02:43:20.340 --> 02:43:24.420]  those meds had worn off he admitted that he was drugged and they had to get him
[02:43:24.420 --> 02:43:27.540]  drugged back again and he looked like a zombie when he appeared at his first
[02:43:27.540 --> 02:43:30.260]  hearings and now they're gonna drive him again because I've seen some of those
[02:43:30.260 --> 02:43:34.580]  drawings of him when he's not drugged he looks normal they could grab any of us
[02:43:34.580 --> 02:43:39.580]  drug us we're amnesiac we don't remember anything and they just blame us this is
[02:43:39.580 --> 02:43:43.540]  the oldest trick in the book and man that really shows you how nasty the
[02:43:43.540 --> 02:43:47.460]  Obama people are why are they so confident cuz I agree it's blowing up in
[02:43:47.460 --> 02:43:51.300]  their face but they're moving forward Joel well they are and we're gonna see
[02:43:51.300 --> 02:43:55.460]  more sandy hooks I don't think this gun control agenda is gonna pass I think
[02:43:55.460 --> 02:44:01.220]  they're gonna get you know at best they're gonna get the enhanced
[02:44:01.220 --> 02:44:04.380]  background checks which means basically there's no more private sales without a
[02:44:04.380 --> 02:44:08.140]  bet and they'll start to build a list but they still won't get a list they're
[02:44:08.140 --> 02:44:12.260]  going to need to do the grandfather thing that's a very powerful and evil
[02:44:12.260 --> 02:44:16.820]  agenda when they ban assault weapons and they say if you have it and I think
[02:44:16.820 --> 02:44:19.460]  someday they're gonna say you can have any weapon but you're gonna have to
[02:44:19.460 --> 02:44:24.260]  register it they're gonna need that in order to get a confiscatory rest that
[02:44:24.260 --> 02:44:28.980]  they will use absolutely man I tell you though I mean I don't just get up here
[02:44:28.980 --> 02:44:33.220]  on say I believe something staged if it isn't they keep doing it in Colorado
[02:44:33.220 --> 02:44:39.020]  this was close to Littleton Littleton the whole thing with Harrison Kleibold
[02:44:39.020 --> 02:44:43.380]  totally staged if you look at the real news of that hundred and twenty seven
[02:44:43.380 --> 02:44:48.660]  bombs in the building half the school empty they did training videos part of
[02:44:48.660 --> 02:44:53.260]  the school of a mass shooting DARPA connections to that I mean you look at
[02:44:53.260 --> 02:44:58.140]  all these things it is amazing they had a mass shooting outside Fort Worth I
[02:44:58.140 --> 02:45:01.780]  don't know like 14 years ago and it was in the local news that neighbors saw the
[02:45:01.780 --> 02:45:10.060]  Navy veteran being drug out being drug out to his van out to a white van and
[02:45:10.060 --> 02:45:13.100]  driven away a week before he went and shot everybody I mean it's just like
[02:45:13.100 --> 02:45:19.380]  with with with the Aurora Colorado shooting I mean it is the most cut-and-dry
[02:45:19.380 --> 02:45:24.180]  mind control where they're just doing it out in the open I mean in a DARPA
[02:45:24.180 --> 02:45:28.540]  program Theodore Kaczynski was in the CIA MK ultra program that's LA Times
[02:45:28.540 --> 02:45:32.900]  that's Associated Press I showed you that last Friday I showed people that
[02:45:32.900 --> 02:45:41.700]  the articles I mean this is so insane all right we're gonna go ahead now and
[02:45:41.700 --> 02:45:49.140]  take some phone calls here Joe in Pennsylvania you're on the air Joe in
[02:45:49.140 --> 02:45:51.260]  Pennsylvania you're on the air go ahead and ask your question while we're
[02:45:51.260 --> 02:45:56.180]  getting Joel back okay yeah first of all I want to thank you guys for everything
[02:45:56.180 --> 02:46:01.460]  you're doing I'm a longtime listener and I support all you guys but I have a
[02:46:01.460 --> 02:46:06.380]  question there's a lot of talk going on I've been listening for years about all
[02:46:06.380 --> 02:46:09.900]  these things that are happening and it's happening faster and faster and we're
[02:46:09.900 --> 02:46:15.060]  losing more and more my question is to the leaders that are in this movement
[02:46:15.060 --> 02:46:19.980]  such as yourself and Joel and all the others that are out there when when it
[02:46:19.980 --> 02:46:24.780]  comes time have you ever thought about what's gonna happen when the proverbial
[02:46:24.780 --> 02:46:29.780]  crap hits the fan have you ever considered taking like your own
[02:46:29.780 --> 02:46:34.100]  resources together to save as many poor people as you can from the things that
[02:46:34.100 --> 02:46:38.020]  are gonna happen because what I found is if you try to just quote share
[02:46:38.020 --> 02:46:43.060]  everything you've got up front then it just gets dissipated poor people don't
[02:46:43.060 --> 02:46:46.900]  know how to take care of themselves then you're poor you have to build systems to
[02:46:46.900 --> 02:46:52.140]  try to empower as many people as you can and then see I just don't see all this
[02:46:52.140 --> 02:46:58.180]  as a foregone as a foregone conclusion and I am trying to get my family and
[02:46:58.180 --> 02:47:01.940]  people I know around me ready I'm trying to get everybody out there ready with
[02:47:01.940 --> 02:47:05.780]  some basics before things degrade so that those of us that are awake and
[02:47:05.780 --> 02:47:11.700]  aware have a better chance Joel you know I think so many people have tried to
[02:47:11.700 --> 02:47:16.260]  fashion let's just assume the worst case scenario we do suffer nuclear war they
[02:47:16.260 --> 02:47:21.820]  do put us into a new world order in reaction to that there's no way you can
[02:47:21.820 --> 02:47:26.860]  prepare and gather people in advance people have jobs people have varying
[02:47:26.860 --> 02:47:30.620]  financial circumstances and even if you were able to get together knit together
[02:47:30.620 --> 02:47:35.260]  a very big group you'd get infiltrated there'd be in fighting what I think is
[02:47:35.260 --> 02:47:40.300]  going to happen is that if we like you're doing now and what I'm doing Alex
[02:47:40.300 --> 02:47:44.660]  trying to get people to prepare for both scenarios if we win that's fine but we
[02:47:44.660 --> 02:47:49.900]  at the same time we have to prepare for a takedown we have to prepare for a loss
[02:47:49.900 --> 02:47:55.060]  in advance prepare an orderly retreat if people have prepared so that they can
[02:47:55.060 --> 02:47:58.940]  survive this nuclear war I think we're going to have to rely upon the
[02:47:58.940 --> 02:48:04.340]  individual inspiration of God as people are driven out you know right now we're
[02:48:04.340 --> 02:48:08.220]  all spread out around the world I think God is going to drive people out of the
[02:48:08.220 --> 02:48:12.300]  big cities when no longer have jobs to keep them there and they're gonna make
[02:48:12.300 --> 02:48:16.620]  us get for self-sufficient they're gonna feel the inspiration to go to places
[02:48:16.620 --> 02:48:21.180]  where it's safer and they're gonna congregate to places which have have a
[02:48:21.180 --> 02:48:25.220]  reputation for being safer and then we'll have a majority of people in those
[02:48:25.220 --> 02:48:29.140]  areas that will be able to contend with the New World Order and re-establish
[02:48:29.140 --> 02:48:32.820]  Liberty exactly here's an example of the caller if I randomly went and got 10
[02:48:32.820 --> 02:48:36.060]  poor people brought into my house and said I'm gonna divide everything I've
[02:48:36.060 --> 02:48:39.580]  got up amongst you they would start fighting with each other and I'm telling
[02:48:39.580 --> 02:48:43.700]  you the way this works someone would probably end up killing me I mean it's
[02:48:43.700 --> 02:48:47.580]  just you get that's the thing about redistribution you cannot you've got to
[02:48:47.580 --> 02:48:52.380]  teach people how to catch fish not feed them fish and and and I mean that's
[02:48:52.380 --> 02:48:55.440]  really the message I'm giving people that's why the globalists want you
[02:48:55.440 --> 02:48:58.540]  dependent and want you to not know how to do anything that's why they teach
[02:48:58.540 --> 02:49:03.220]  kids 2 plus 2 doesn't necessarily equal 4 and see that's not a joke now they're
[02:49:03.220 --> 02:49:10.700]  teaching kids how to be basket cases as part of the takeover Joel and as I say
[02:49:10.700 --> 02:49:14.060]  you know that's why I don't even recommend that people try to join
[02:49:14.060 --> 02:49:18.460]  survival groups like the Citadel forming a walled city it just makes you a target
[02:49:18.460 --> 02:49:23.020]  I think it is sufficient for people to prepare as best they can and if they
[02:49:23.020 --> 02:49:26.700]  can't afford a retreat they prepare where they are they get to a fairly safe
[02:49:26.700 --> 02:49:31.380]  place in the outskirts of cities they prepare to leave when times get bad and
[02:49:31.380 --> 02:49:36.380]  then I think we can knit together a society and and I believe in informal
[02:49:36.380 --> 02:49:41.380]  networks of people of support networks not that you have to meet every week or
[02:49:41.380 --> 02:49:45.620]  make yourself a target but informal lists of people in your own mind that
[02:49:45.620 --> 02:49:49.140]  you know you can try exactly people always say trust me trust me trust me
[02:49:49.140 --> 02:49:53.740]  you can only trust somebody you really know I always say don't trust me know me
[02:49:53.740 --> 02:50:02.780]  and then you will have trust go ahead Joel well I mean do you agree with that
[02:50:02.780 --> 02:50:09.500]  statement I just made yeah his Skype went down again it's it's it's been
[02:50:09.500 --> 02:50:13.180]  really really rocky here but we've had him longer it's been a great interview
[02:50:13.180 --> 02:50:20.540]  so far and Joe does that answer your question yeah in a way it does I just
[02:50:20.540 --> 02:50:24.780]  feel really bad because there's there's so many people that are poor that want
[02:50:24.780 --> 02:50:27.020]  to do things that are not going to know where to go and they're going to be
[02:50:27.020 --> 02:50:32.540]  looking for leadership and I just would hate to think that their options are to
[02:50:32.540 --> 02:50:35.740]  just walk themselves into those camps when oh no they're going to join the
[02:50:35.740 --> 02:50:39.480]  FEMA Brigade and though and then they give it a machine gun to take out the
[02:50:39.480 --> 02:50:43.260]  terrorists I mean it's gonna be fun well I wouldn't feel bad for the average poor
[02:50:43.260 --> 02:50:46.980]  people they're gonna be used as the new soldier force that you know those that
[02:50:46.980 --> 02:50:50.300]  can't take care of themselves against whoever was self-sufficient and bring us
[02:50:50.300 --> 02:50:53.840]  back to the camps and make us work for them that's actually gonna be poor
[02:50:53.840 --> 02:50:58.060]  people in black uniforms and machine guns at us we're gonna be in the fields
[02:50:58.060 --> 02:51:02.340]  working for them okay we'll be right back stay with us if you're listening

[02:54:25.220 --> 02:54:28.500]  had invited people in because they couldn't hold the area they came in
[02:54:28.500 --> 02:54:32.220]  they built farms Santa Ana was coming to take property guns everything people

[02:54:57.780 --> 02:55:01.580]  fodder to fill the prisons final segment with Joel Skousen of world affairs
[02:55:01.580 --> 02:55:05.980]  brief calm Doris in Tennessee thanks for holding real quick question for Joel go
[02:55:05.980 --> 02:55:15.860]  ahead hello yes ma'am I really agree with everything that you say and what my
[02:55:15.860 --> 02:55:21.380]  main concern is right now is the corruption of this government and now
[02:55:21.380 --> 02:55:26.740]  we're being indoctrinated with you know I love Rosa Cory but I don't want to
[02:55:26.740 --> 02:55:32.260]  say these commercials on TV for same-sex marriage Fox News is running them
[02:55:32.260 --> 02:55:36.920]  constantly well no sure sure I mean let's expand on this it's not that we
[02:55:36.920 --> 02:55:40.220]  dislike people for whatever they're doing I mean we're all you know do
[02:55:40.220 --> 02:55:44.260]  things that you know in God's system God sees as bad it's the issue is they're
[02:55:44.260 --> 02:55:49.420]  forcing it on kids they are trying to end the family and they're trying to to
[02:55:49.420 --> 02:55:54.540]  to sexualize children everywhere and it it is very evil so I guess that's a
[02:55:54.540 --> 02:55:58.660]  question for Joel Skousen I mean that is part of the plan is to destroy the
[02:55:58.660 --> 02:56:03.660]  family Joel Skousen it is and they're using the doctrine of rights to say you
[02:56:03.660 --> 02:56:08.380]  know this is just not right that we cannot exercise the right to be married
[02:56:08.380 --> 02:56:13.340]  but it is a misunderstanding of the doctrine of rights they have the perfect
[02:56:13.340 --> 02:56:17.860]  right to go ahead in private and have whatever relationships they want they
[02:56:17.860 --> 02:56:23.060]  don't have the right to force other people to accept that however and that's
[02:56:23.060 --> 02:56:26.440]  what we lost in the civil rights movement we lost the right of private
[02:56:26.440 --> 02:56:30.780]  discrimination and it's a fundamental right if you don't have the right to
[02:56:30.780 --> 02:56:35.100]  disassociate then you've really lost a major fundamental right that can force
[02:56:35.100 --> 02:56:37.860]  that upon me here's the deal all of these groups that are saying they're
[02:56:37.860 --> 02:56:41.900]  being persecuted have diverse people in them but but but the ones that
[02:56:41.900 --> 02:56:47.020]  globalist are controlling are wanting to force us to accept everything they're
[02:56:47.020 --> 02:56:52.580]  pushing including euthanasia I mean it's the whole agenda is just anti-life I
[02:56:52.580 --> 02:56:55.620]  mean the globalist I have the I have the university documents I cover it in
[02:56:55.620 --> 02:57:00.840]  in-game 2.0 the extra to it that's on prison planet on TV where we read the
[02:57:00.840 --> 02:57:04.620]  you know the stuff where they said we're gonna promote homosexuality show that we
[02:57:04.620 --> 02:57:08.580]  can reduce population in the family I mean you know and then and then I've had
[02:57:08.580 --> 02:57:13.140]  people in Whole Foods demonize my three kids and tell me I shouldn't have three
[02:57:13.140 --> 02:57:19.980]  kids they're discriminating against me I'm sorry Joel go ahead well there is a
[02:57:19.980 --> 02:57:24.940]  war against the family and it's on a lot of sides whether it's birth control
[02:57:24.940 --> 02:57:30.020]  whether it's abortion whether it's the discouragement of families but I believe
[02:57:30.020 --> 02:57:36.540]  you know and we're losing the battle of eugenics basically because other more
[02:57:36.540 --> 02:57:42.700]  socialist economies are out producing us the American white Christian family is
[02:57:42.700 --> 02:57:47.260]  not producing as many children as they should and we should be having more
[02:57:47.260 --> 02:57:51.300]  children we should be keeping them out of the public schools we've got to start
[02:57:51.300 --> 02:57:56.020]  more homeschooling or using private schools to raise up a generation that
[02:57:56.020 --> 02:57:59.260]  can withstand what's coming well look at the new Southern Poverty Law Center
[02:57:59.260 --> 02:58:04.580]  report that actually says being white is inherently bad I mean I mean Ben they're
[02:58:04.580 --> 02:58:08.940]  really I mean it's almost meant to make whites become racial I mean it's like
[02:58:08.940 --> 02:58:14.580]  so openly saying white men are bad period well we're certainly leading the

[03:01:05.300 --> 03:01:11.140]  be breaking that down but Mike in Tennessee a WM QM 1600 a.m. listener
[03:01:11.140 --> 03:01:15.260]  you're on the air go ahead good afternoon two quick questions first of
[03:01:15.260 --> 03:01:19.300]  all how soon before someone walks into a bank and says this is a haircut give me
[03:01:19.300 --> 03:01:23.700]  all the money well actually I've seen the editorial cartoons where you go up
[03:01:23.700 --> 03:01:27.180]  to the bank window and they aim a gun at you and say but know that that's not a
[03:01:27.180 --> 03:01:31.300]  stick-up on the bank just says 40% of your money's gone that's liberal and
[03:01:31.300 --> 03:01:34.820]  loving and good and if you don't like it you're an extremist as the Southern
[03:01:34.820 --> 03:01:38.780]  Poverty Law Center and ADL say the Federal Reserve is federal even though
[03:01:38.780 --> 03:01:43.580]  it's admittedly private that played Greenspan saying that it isn't are you a
[03:01:43.580 --> 03:01:47.780]  terrorist sir because no one had a walk and shoe gum is terrorism knowing how to
[03:01:47.780 --> 03:01:51.900]  tie your shoelaces quite frankly if you know how to wipe your hand your hind end
[03:01:51.900 --> 03:01:55.500]  sir you're a terrorist did you figure that out the public schools now teach
[03:01:55.500 --> 03:02:00.540]  two plus two equals five okay yeah I mean literally they now teach that I
[03:02:00.540 --> 03:02:04.980]  mean you're evil are you saying two plus two equals four because that's racist
[03:02:04.980 --> 03:02:09.620]  it's Joel still on the liner see how he had to go he had to go go ahead if you
[03:02:09.620 --> 03:02:14.820]  can share this with him ask him was this glass air RGA Chuck Hooper built plane
[03:02:14.820 --> 03:02:20.140]  and was his tail number did it start with CG and if it did you need to get
[03:02:20.140 --> 03:02:23.620]  back with me I probably can help him figure out what happened to it
[03:02:23.620 --> 03:02:28.620]  guys pull up that video of his plane see if the tail number has CG in it it would
[03:02:28.620 --> 03:02:33.420]  start off with CG I've got a relatives who's a manufacturer of those planes
[03:02:33.420 --> 03:02:38.140]  they didn't they didn't make a lot of them and if he's got one I bet you his
[03:02:38.140 --> 03:02:50.220]  fuel filler cap vent was clogged well it's amazing he didn't get hurt worse
[03:02:50.220 --> 03:02:54.620]  aircraft everything happens very quickly with that plane and they're very
[03:02:54.620 --> 03:03:01.940]  critical little things make big changes real quickly and he is very fortunate he
[03:03:01.940 --> 03:03:06.740]  certainly is you think he was smart to take the plane in fast yes definitely
[03:03:06.740 --> 03:03:10.860]  yes that's you know hit the ground and slide on your butt is probably the
[03:03:10.860 --> 03:03:16.760]  safest thing you could have done Wow well listen I really appreciate you
[03:03:16.760 --> 03:03:21.340]  coming on with us as a caller good to hear from you let's talk to Scott in
[03:03:21.340 --> 03:03:25.140]  Arizona Scott you're on the air go ahead

[03:03:42.940 --> 03:03:47.980]  be it for calls that I have time for here today because I want to hit on some
[03:03:47.980 --> 03:03:53.700]  other news items that I have not even gotten to yet but I was just speaking
[03:03:53.700 --> 03:04:01.020]  about again you're brought up you know my parents fiscally conservative but
[03:04:01.020 --> 03:04:05.220]  when it came to like race issues and things you know liberal this is you know
[03:04:05.220 --> 03:04:09.420]  kumbaya Christian stuff and again the globalist want divide and conquer but
[03:04:09.420 --> 03:04:13.020]  then you have Michael Moore coming out saying 90% of guns are owned by scared
[03:04:13.020 --> 03:04:16.620]  white people we're gonna play that clip when we come back that just shows of
[03:04:16.620 --> 03:04:20.260]  course that's not true 90% of guns are not owned by white people actually went
[03:04:20.260 --> 03:04:24.940]  looked up the best statistics they think and something around 60% of guns are
[03:04:24.940 --> 03:04:28.780]  owned by white people because 60% of people above about the age of 30 or so
[03:04:28.780 --> 03:04:35.620]  are white so it's pure lies but now see it's a racial issue turn your guns in or
[03:04:35.620 --> 03:04:42.700]  evil whitey evil whitey gun owners are racist the NRA is racist when the NRA
[03:04:42.700 --> 03:04:47.740]  was a Republican group founded after the Civil War to train Northerners how to
[03:04:47.740 --> 03:04:50.580]  shoot better because they weren't growing up around guns most of them are
[03:04:50.580 --> 03:04:56.220]  immigrants it was the south with the Ku Klux Klan that had the first gun laws
[03:04:56.220 --> 03:05:00.700]  but that doesn't matter it's now racist to own a gun and over your money

[03:08:09.540 --> 03:08:16.140]  is breaking news breaking news up at info wars calm and prison planet calm by
[03:08:16.140 --> 03:08:21.980]  Steve Watson video hundreds of DHS armored trucks on the move more footage
[03:08:21.980 --> 03:08:26.740]  of military vehicles being delivered services online they've admittedly
[03:08:26.740 --> 03:08:35.260]  bought 2,700 more this year and we have videos of DHS HSI homeland security with
[03:08:35.260 --> 03:08:40.740]  the armored vehicles patrolling in America with the armored vehicles
[03:08:40.740 --> 03:08:46.940]  patrolling in America which they admit they're patrolling in America but when
[03:08:46.940 --> 03:08:50.620]  we talk about it they say they don't exist and then point out that some of
[03:08:50.620 --> 03:08:54.940]  the same vehicles are delivered to the Marines and the Army for overseas use to
[03:08:54.940 --> 03:09:00.260]  kind of confuse everybody you see and and they'll do that as long as they can
[03:09:00.260 --> 03:09:04.060]  just to make it a debate about does it exist instead of having the debate about
[03:09:04.060 --> 03:09:08.540]  why are you militarizing police that's no secret no secret police departments
[03:09:08.540 --> 03:09:12.740]  in your town I mean everybody's seen it in local paper where they get the
[03:09:12.740 --> 03:09:15.220]  different armored vehicle some of them six-wheeled some of them four-wheeled
[03:09:15.220 --> 03:09:19.860]  but they're getting these really heavy ones now that are being deployed and
[03:09:19.860 --> 03:09:24.500]  I've talked to military I've been sent video they've got regular tanks cached
[03:09:24.500 --> 03:09:32.420]  at many armories so we can punch this up here on screen for TV viewers if not
[03:09:32.420 --> 03:09:38.780]  radio listeners just go to info wars calm and you can see you can see a link
[03:09:38.780 --> 03:09:44.740]  to some of the YouTube videos that show these heavy armored trucks and it breaks
[03:09:44.740 --> 03:09:53.500]  down where the MR AP trucks are are going to there's also Bradley fighting
[03:09:53.500 --> 03:09:58.940]  vehicles painted up from the camo desert camo to the camo for here in the United
[03:09:58.940 --> 03:10:03.900]  States and they've got all sorts of bulldozers and just you know you name it
[03:10:03.900 --> 03:10:14.780]  with them super creepville and also if you go to drudge report.com you can see
[03:10:14.780 --> 03:10:33.860]  the big story about 360 million more bullets 360 million more bullets here's
[03:10:33.860 --> 03:10:38.220]  another headline Southern California seeks drone zone and again they'll just
[03:10:38.220 --> 03:10:42.220]  condition you that it's for the border which they leave wide open and then over
[03:10:42.220 --> 03:10:49.100]  time deploy it everywhere then right there 50-point swing on targeted drone
[03:10:49.100 --> 03:10:58.300]  killings of US citizens and let's see what that article is about up at Drudge
[03:10:58.300 --> 03:11:03.300]  I haven't even seen this yet this just broke and that's out of slate 50-point
[03:11:03.300 --> 03:11:07.860]  swing against targeted drone killings of US citizens a year ago as the
[03:11:07.860 --> 03:11:11.700]  presidential race was taking shape the Washington Post pollster asked voters
[03:11:11.700 --> 03:11:15.620]  whether they favored the use of drones to kill terrorists or terror suspects
[03:11:15.620 --> 03:11:18.700]  if they were American citizens living in other countries the net rating at the
[03:11:18.700 --> 03:11:26.580]  time was a positive 65% for 26% firmly against a day after a month of Rand Paul
[03:11:26.580 --> 03:11:30.100]  driven discussion how about drudge report calm driven and in full wars
[03:11:30.100 --> 03:11:34.540]  calm driven I'm not giving I'm not taking credit away from Rand Paul it's
[03:11:34.540 --> 03:11:38.180]  just you know we've been the ones pointing this out in the wilderness and
[03:11:38.180 --> 03:11:42.220]  I'm just showing the power of our listeners and in drugs reports of course
[03:11:42.220 --> 03:11:46.980]  is driven away over the top today after a month of Rand Paul driven discussion
[03:11:46.980 --> 03:11:51.820]  on drone warfare Gallup poll asked the same question
[03:11:51.820 --> 03:11:55.700]  should US drones be used to launch airstrikes other countries against US
[03:11:55.700 --> 03:11:58.660]  citizens living abroad who were suspected terrorists suspected you
[03:11:58.660 --> 03:12:04.340]  notice new numbers 41% for 52% against there's been a massive basically a
[03:12:04.340 --> 03:12:09.420]  swing the other direction show there and of course Gallup is always
[03:12:09.420 --> 03:12:14.580]  whitewashing things and I'm I'm sure it's way more serious than that most
[03:12:14.580 --> 03:12:17.640]  people I know understand drones are very very serious because they also get
[03:12:17.640 --> 03:12:22.340]  their robotic there's something even colder about the fact that it's a robot
[03:12:22.340 --> 03:12:26.140]  and and and and more and more they are autonomous and then again DHS to buy
[03:12:26.140 --> 03:12:31.100]  360 million more rounds of hollow point ammunition and then they say it's for
[03:12:31.100 --> 03:12:35.320]  target practice when you don't use hollow points in target practicing
[03:12:35.320 --> 03:12:41.460]  period end of story they cost up to four times as more as full metal jacket and
[03:12:41.460 --> 03:12:47.260]  now they're buying over a hundred different types of weird ammo that no
[03:12:47.260 --> 03:12:53.620]  feds use and the military doesn't use I mean everything from 3a to you know
[03:12:53.620 --> 03:13:01.380]  seven millimeter mag 38 special I mean they're just buying it all they've got
[03:13:01.380 --> 03:13:04.660]  it bought out years they can't even manufacture it fast enough I want to
[03:13:04.660 --> 03:13:09.300]  know why manufacturers aren't creating a coalition to sell to citizens and to say
[03:13:09.300 --> 03:13:12.980]  we're not selling to the feds there's already some coalition saying it's very
[03:13:12.980 --> 03:13:16.460]  large thing we're not going to sell guns to departments that are anti-gun man
[03:13:16.460 --> 03:13:23.300]  it's a big deal that we've dropped the crime rate 49% since 1991 that's the
[03:13:23.300 --> 03:13:29.860]  latest numbers is 91 to 2011 20-year official FBI local numbers very accurate
[03:13:29.860 --> 03:13:33.620]  the world standard statistics you can say a lot about Jaeger Hoover but he did
[03:13:33.620 --> 03:13:36.980]  get statistics down he was obsessed with it he pretty much launched the modern
[03:13:36.980 --> 03:13:41.260]  science of statistics that was actually codified off local numbers and it's a 49
[03:13:41.260 --> 03:13:47.060]  whopper 49 whopper I mean criminals are scared and and then they say well you
[03:13:47.060 --> 03:13:51.540]  don't need semi-auto to protect yourself from criminals I saw a video online that
[03:13:51.540 --> 03:13:54.580]  we're gonna play on the nightly news tonight I'm gonna add some updates to it
[03:13:54.580 --> 03:13:59.420]  where you know you know the top ten you know robbers shot and it shows robbers
[03:13:59.420 --> 03:14:03.340]  running in actually shoot people they get shot and you need semi-auto the
[03:14:03.340 --> 03:14:08.260]  robbers have semi-auto hey police if we don't need semi-auto to protect
[03:14:08.260 --> 03:14:12.580]  ourselves we see that double-barrel shotgun I got an idea for you you don't
[03:14:12.580 --> 03:14:17.340]  need semi-auto either I am now for gun control just like Jesse Ventura said you
[03:14:17.340 --> 03:14:23.540]  turn your guns in now you turn your guns in now you turn your guns in government
[03:14:23.540 --> 03:14:28.460]  you turn in all the semi-autos and you turn in the bullets and you turn in the
[03:14:28.460 --> 03:14:31.700]  armored vehicles and the drones and the body armor what do you need that for
[03:14:31.700 --> 03:14:36.860]  because you don't need those to protect yourself defensively of course that's
[03:14:36.860 --> 03:14:40.900]  not true actually you need semi-auto they'd fetishize full auto but you
[03:14:40.900 --> 03:14:43.420]  don't need that because it spray your whole clip and it doesn't hit what you're
[03:14:43.420 --> 03:14:48.060]  aiming at you need semi-auto for target acquisition and you know the whole the
[03:14:48.060 --> 03:14:51.700]  whole nine yards you got an enemy with semi-auto the criminals always have
[03:14:51.700 --> 03:14:55.180]  semi-auto and I know you know this is gun owners the general public doesn't
[03:14:55.180 --> 03:14:59.020]  know it okay and they're gonna ban our guns they're coming they're gonna stage
[03:14:59.020 --> 03:15:02.460]  more sandy hooks they folks we take they staged all these things I've looked at
[03:15:02.460 --> 03:15:06.940]  them now I mean it they are a bunch of murderers when you see those probed gun
[03:15:06.940 --> 03:15:09.840]  confiscation people on TV a lot of licking their lips going you know too
[03:15:09.840 --> 03:15:13.020]  bad Harry Reid's kids aren't you know grandkids aren't dead and all this and
[03:15:13.020 --> 03:15:16.820]  let's show the dead kids and all this you're looking at some monsters let me
[03:15:16.820 --> 03:15:22.180]  tell you a lot of them are in on the fact okay they know full well this is
[03:15:22.180 --> 03:15:25.300]  about they're not trying to get your guns they really care about kids these
[03:15:25.300 --> 03:15:30.180]  are monster authoritarian scum okay anybody wants your guns they want to
[03:15:30.180 --> 03:15:34.380]  dominate you and your family and you know it let's go to Michael Moore
[03:15:34.380 --> 03:15:38.940]  speaking of a disgusting pig like creature his soul is pig like not
[03:15:38.940 --> 03:15:43.020]  because he's obese and looks like a that's mean to pigs this is a guy who
[03:15:43.020 --> 03:15:46.380]  has five to six bodyguards armed owns guns his people been arrested having
[03:15:46.380 --> 03:15:51.820]  guns illegal areas this pig this maggot this this hypocritical blob who works
[03:15:51.820 --> 03:15:55.580]  for the globalists and the tyrants who poses as a liberal this authoritarian
[03:15:55.580 --> 03:16:01.980]  scumbag enemy of humanity okay this guy says it's basically racist to own guns
[03:16:01.980 --> 03:16:06.180]  scared white people I mean you are such a piece of garbage trying to create
[03:16:06.180 --> 03:16:11.300]  racial division as best you can let's go ahead and go to the pig the garbage the
[03:16:11.300 --> 03:16:17.660]  filth the words that describe the degeneracy and the lyrical evil of this
[03:16:17.660 --> 03:16:22.540]  Viper here is Michael Moore you realize that over 90% of the guns in this
[03:16:22.540 --> 03:16:27.940]  country are owned by white people in the suburbs and in rural areas 90% of our
[03:16:27.940 --> 03:16:32.620]  guns are not owned by african-americans hispanics minority groups they're owned
[03:16:32.620 --> 03:16:37.020]  by white people now what are these white people so afraid of out in the suburbs
[03:16:37.020 --> 03:16:41.100]  are they thinking little redhead freckle-faced Jimmy down the street is
[03:16:41.100 --> 03:16:45.700]  going to you know kill them mug them actually they are I don't think so are
[03:16:45.700 --> 03:16:48.980]  they afraid the guy next door is gonna is gonna break in and steal their their
[03:16:48.980 --> 03:16:55.380]  TV no because they know the guy next door makes 50 $60,000 a year so poverty
[03:16:55.380 --> 03:17:00.500]  and racism see this is a redistribution it's pretty much the same answer for a
[03:17:00.500 --> 03:17:03.740]  lot of other that's enough we're not editing it just cut out in the YouTube
[03:17:03.740 --> 03:17:07.620]  club okay and and the full clips up on info wars calm if you want to go watch
[03:17:07.620 --> 03:17:13.340]  it but I mean there it is you are inherently bad if you've got $50,000 a
[03:17:13.340 --> 03:17:18.820]  year that's the new rich if you've saved a hundred thousand euros that in Europe
[03:17:18.820 --> 03:17:23.420]  I mean it's so expensive in Europe that's like having $30,000 saved on
[03:17:23.420 --> 03:17:28.440]  average 30 imagine if you save your whole life of $30,000 so you could
[03:17:28.440 --> 03:17:33.220]  retire for one year you need a million dollars now to really retire
[03:17:33.220 --> 03:17:36.780]  comfortably and say live 15 years of course now they're saying you can't
[03:17:36.780 --> 03:17:43.380]  retire to your 80 or something okay so if you look at all of this and you break
[03:17:43.380 --> 03:17:49.500]  all this down what is what is Michael Moore saying he's saying that that it is
[03:17:49.500 --> 03:17:55.060]  inherently bad a to be white and to live in the suburbs and have 50 $60,000 a
[03:17:55.060 --> 03:17:59.020]  year and that you're racist because you don't want someone to expropriate your
[03:17:59.020 --> 03:18:02.340]  wealth and rob you and by the way let me tell you something living out in the
[03:18:02.340 --> 03:18:05.380]  country if there are mainly cool white people in your area you're worried about
[03:18:05.380 --> 03:18:09.100]  white people breaking in your house or anybody I mean I don't talk to anybody
[03:18:09.100 --> 03:18:13.500]  who goes I've got guns cuz I'm worried black people are gonna come out here and
[03:18:13.500 --> 03:18:18.500]  rob us you know actually in the country it'll be like meth head hillbillies that
[03:18:18.500 --> 03:18:25.740]  rob your house and now now if if I was in a predominantly black neighborhood say
[03:18:25.740 --> 03:18:29.740]  Harlem that has a high crime rate on black and white doesn't matter then I
[03:18:29.740 --> 03:18:33.940]  might statistically be scared of guys that look like criminals who happen to
[03:18:33.940 --> 03:18:37.460]  be black just like if I pulled up and saw hillbilly type meth heads you know
[03:18:37.460 --> 03:18:41.060]  with the big mullets running out of my garage you know throwing something back
[03:18:41.060 --> 03:18:44.100]  a truck I'd say oh they're robbing my house I mean you know you could tell
[03:18:44.100 --> 03:18:49.020]  trashy people period but see everything is racial you're not allowed to try to
[03:18:49.020 --> 03:18:52.700]  move out of the agenda 21 cities and have a garden and have some chickens and
[03:18:52.700 --> 03:18:56.480]  have a shotgun you're not allowed to you're inherently bad because you're
[03:18:56.480 --> 03:19:03.260]  white and you have now moved out to the countryside you're scared racist white
[03:19:03.260 --> 03:19:07.560]  people because you don't want to live in the Wonderland like Detroit that big
[03:19:07.560 --> 03:19:12.600]  government creates we're gonna skip this network break here let's go ahead and
[03:19:12.600 --> 03:19:18.380]  talk to Jake listening on xm 166 go ahead Jake you're on the air thanks for
[03:19:18.380 --> 03:19:26.260]  holding a little bit think about a few things and maybe you know answer some
[03:19:26.260 --> 03:19:31.780]  of my questions have you ever looked into the hierarchy of the world ie Ross
[03:19:31.780 --> 03:19:36.300]  trials and Illuminati into what they actually believe and the faintest belief
[03:19:36.300 --> 03:19:41.160]  that they have being that Gnosticism they're not Satanist Satanists are kind
[03:19:41.160 --> 03:19:47.380]  of their minions they're Luciferians have you ever looked into Gnosticism and
[03:19:47.380 --> 03:19:52.620]  the beliefs held by Gnostics I know it's not a belief that we would be a lot no
[03:19:52.620 --> 03:19:57.020]  no I've said it's a very diverse group and I have I have looked into it yes I
[03:19:57.020 --> 03:20:03.020]  mean the hierarchy and the masonry in which I belong to in which I rejected
[03:20:03.020 --> 03:20:08.140]  it is all about Gnosticism and then the further you go up into that it is
[03:20:08.140 --> 03:20:14.020]  essentially controlled by Satan and it's just a misinterpretation of the Bible
[03:20:14.020 --> 03:20:18.580]  when adding different parts sure they believe Lucifer is they believe Lucifer
[03:20:18.580 --> 03:20:25.020]  is God and Jesus is the devil absolutely that's absolutely right and a belief of
[03:20:25.020 --> 03:20:29.860]  another God named Sophia as well but those hierarchy in the Rothschilds and
[03:20:29.860 --> 03:20:35.740]  all those people have this skewed a view of the way religion is held in the
[03:20:35.740 --> 03:20:38.900]  beliefs that they have well they also believe they're bringing balance to
[03:20:38.900 --> 03:20:42.620]  everything and so killing us is good because we deserve to be killed because
[03:20:42.620 --> 03:20:45.980]  we're profane ugly and bad but then they do everything they can to make us ugly
[03:20:45.980 --> 03:20:49.940]  and dumb and dumb down and fighting with each other as a self-fulfilling prophecy
[03:20:49.940 --> 03:20:54.780]  it's really done from position of weakness absolutely you're absolutely
[03:20:54.780 --> 03:20:59.380]  correct that's what that's what the devil would want to do I mean I mean I
[03:20:59.380 --> 03:21:02.580]  know that not all your listeners are Christian but just think about the evil
[03:21:02.580 --> 03:21:07.500]  inherently evil in these people's mind that they want to control us and to kill
[03:21:07.500 --> 03:21:13.380]  us and the government is on record doing tens of thousands of operations some of
[03:21:13.380 --> 03:21:17.260]  which had thousands of operations in it everybody knows about Tuskegee and
[03:21:17.260 --> 03:21:20.100]  syphilis giving it to black men and that's terrible but I mean it's
[03:21:20.100 --> 03:21:26.860]  radiating foster kids nerve-gassing u.s. troops bio-weapon ing I mean we are
[03:21:26.860 --> 03:21:30.260]  animals to them and then I've shot a YouTube video about it and there are
[03:21:30.260 --> 03:21:34.900]  lazy people on there going show me where they gave black men syphilis I mean
[03:21:34.900 --> 03:21:39.620]  there's just it'd be like show me Washington DC and that the Washington
[03:21:39.620 --> 03:21:42.940]  Monument exists it's like you know it's like they wear their ignorance as a
[03:21:42.940 --> 03:21:47.100]  shield but it doesn't protect them god bless you good to hear from you let's go
[03:21:47.100 --> 03:21:53.220]  to jock listening on the audio streams at infowars.com you're on the air sir
[03:21:53.220 --> 03:21:58.820]  Alex great interview with Billy Corgan yeah I mean I think that interview is
[03:21:58.820 --> 03:22:02.940]  is is is really powerful and very important what do you think about a
[03:22:02.940 --> 03:22:07.580]  victories column on the infowars homepage I agree I have already said
[03:22:07.580 --> 03:22:10.900]  about ten times and not that my crew isn't working hard but I I want to get
[03:22:10.900 --> 03:22:15.780]  a activist section not just on planet infowars.com but on the front page a
[03:22:15.780 --> 03:22:22.340]  activist section and a victory section a good news section and a action section
[03:22:22.340 --> 03:22:25.340]  and and we're gonna add those yes sir I'm gonna write that down right now go
[03:22:25.340 --> 03:22:33.660]  ahead what do you think about you know the psychology of bullying obviously
[03:22:33.660 --> 03:22:37.020]  from the schoolyard we know there there there's just one way to stop a boy and
[03:22:37.020 --> 03:22:41.780]  that's to resist him but one way to resist is to laugh at them and I think
[03:22:41.780 --> 03:22:46.740]  that your videos that you post where you make fun of the bullies those are the
[03:22:46.740 --> 03:22:50.340]  ones that get you in trouble with YouTube yes anytime I solve for Mike
[03:22:50.340 --> 03:22:53.580]  Adams do that and and there's nothing that breaks YouTube's rules they ban
[03:22:53.580 --> 03:22:58.460]  them they really hate being powerfully made fun of and made to look weak like
[03:22:58.460 --> 03:23:02.420]  they are the globalist all try to have extra power because they're scared deep
[03:23:02.420 --> 03:23:07.700]  down and and they have this narcissistic image of themselves as this thing they
[03:23:07.700 --> 03:23:12.460]  aren't really that's why the power trip happens like someone with real power is
[03:23:12.460 --> 03:23:18.420]  in who's not evil is embarrassed to exercise it and is and and is embarrassed
[03:23:18.420 --> 03:23:21.700]  to use it even when someone deserves to have it used on them and that's why
[03:23:21.700 --> 03:23:25.740]  we're in this straight good powerful people do not ever manifest their power
[03:23:25.740 --> 03:23:29.700]  because they think it's arrogant to manifest it well you know what if you
[03:23:29.700 --> 03:23:33.980]  don't manifest the power God gave you you will be enslaved by the cancerous
[03:23:33.980 --> 03:23:40.060]  globalist well you can see how people like Dick Cheney love it when you come
[03:23:40.060 --> 03:23:44.700]  up to them and ask them their serious opinion on this serious political issue
[03:23:44.700 --> 03:23:49.060]  we shouldn't be asking them anything there we should be laughing at them
[03:23:49.060 --> 03:23:53.940]  because the opinion don't matter well that's right that's why one got lady
[03:23:53.940 --> 03:23:57.500]  was crying the head producer the other was red in the face men had their fists
[03:23:57.500 --> 03:24:00.940]  ready and I just said you're all just agents you're pathetic and then when I
[03:24:00.940 --> 03:24:04.340]  wasn't scared of the men bowing up to me and saying get out of here when I said
[03:24:04.340 --> 03:24:07.380]  all your pathetic little minion yeah you know the you know what it takes to do
[03:24:07.380 --> 03:24:11.300]  something to me you're just posturing they all look totally freaked out and
[03:24:11.300 --> 03:24:16.980]  the men all went from going like this to like because I walked right into their
[03:24:16.980 --> 03:24:20.580]  little I wish I would have done more I walked right into a little dungeon and
[03:24:20.580 --> 03:24:25.500]  you said this is all fake it's all garbage and it shook them up and not
[03:24:25.500 --> 03:24:28.820]  that I did something that great either like I made the mistake of even trying
[03:24:28.820 --> 03:24:32.340]  to give him facts and debate him at all because you know I mean I should have
[03:24:32.340 --> 03:24:36.660]  really hammered down his butt and said you know it's about making us slaves you
[03:24:36.660 --> 03:24:39.100]  know they've taken all the guns everywhere you globalist are in control
[03:24:39.100 --> 03:24:44.020]  I got into some of that yeah but I mean when I watch Diane Feinstein going we're
[03:24:44.020 --> 03:24:48.340]  going to get these bills passed if not this year the next because there will be
[03:24:48.340 --> 03:24:52.980]  more incidents and she smiles for just a minute and our tongue flicks it's like I
[03:24:52.980 --> 03:24:57.900]  can't even do the demonic faces we're gonna get what we want soon enough oh
[03:24:57.900 --> 03:25:03.700]  yeah oh right now it's all being planned and then it's hard to look at these
[03:25:03.700 --> 03:25:07.900]  people another they are that's why I get mad at minions who I know aren't evil
[03:25:07.900 --> 03:25:12.220]  like the like the awesome police chief who is going and selling out to this
[03:25:12.220 --> 03:25:16.540]  because he's just doing it for power down the road and you know when
[03:25:16.540 --> 03:25:20.340]  privately is admitted oh I know this stuff's all crazy and and and either
[03:25:20.340 --> 03:25:25.500]  he's a psychopath liar or he's a little minion who isn't an evil guy but he's
[03:25:25.500 --> 03:25:29.380]  shelling out to the whole deal oh you guys found the video where she talks
[03:25:29.380 --> 03:25:33.780]  about there will be more incidences and smiles yeah yeah okay thank you for the
