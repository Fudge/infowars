[00:00.000 --> 00:10.120]  Waging War on Corruption, it's Alex Jones coming to you live from the front lines of
[00:10.120 --> 00:31.840]  the Info War. We know why Info Wars is being blocked and banned across the world by megacorporations.
[00:31.840 --> 00:41.120]  It's because Info Wars has studied their plan and I wasn't sure if revelations in the Bible
[00:41.120 --> 00:45.600]  was accurate back when I was a kid, I believed in God, but wow, it was a pretty wild story.
[00:45.600 --> 00:52.840]  But now they're implementing it. They have major corporations working with the largest banks in
[00:52.840 --> 00:59.840]  the world on a rollout plan to basically make everyone have an implantable microchip in the
[00:59.840 --> 01:08.400]  hand to buy and sell. But don't worry, there'll be a face scan as well. So it's the face and the hand
[01:08.400 --> 01:16.920]  and the mark means a trademark or a digital code. The term mark means the specific mark of your
[01:16.920 --> 01:26.920]  ability to trade. 2000 years ago, a man on an island of Patmos had a vision, talked about giant
[01:26.920 --> 01:38.040]  flying insects, dropping things that exploded into firebombs the size of mountains. You read all
[01:38.040 --> 01:44.520]  this, you're like, my God, was this guy a time traveler? What happened? Or are they taking these
[01:44.520 --> 01:49.320]  horrible ideas and using it like it's science fiction, but then the science fiction of Jules
[01:49.320 --> 01:55.600]  Verne's or H.D. Wells, it comes true later because what we envision we're actually able to build.
[01:55.600 --> 02:02.680]  It's the previous place, gentlemen. God is real. The devil is real. This one-world government goes
[02:02.680 --> 02:09.720]  out of its way to do evil. And of course, Macron yesterday said nationalism is the great danger.
[02:09.720 --> 02:16.920]  He said patriotism is not caring about your nation. Now, that is total inversion. That's like
[02:16.920 --> 02:25.880]  saying the grim reaper is life or black as white. But that's what he did. He's waging war on reality.
[02:25.880 --> 02:31.720]  We have those clips in the media is all, yes, it's true. To be a patriot, you must hate your
[02:31.720 --> 02:46.680]  nation. Nationalism is a betrayal of patriotism. Total inversion. Just like the undocked video
[02:46.680 --> 02:52.200]  that was, everybody could see that what happened with Jim Acosta, they had every news channel
[02:52.200 --> 02:56.840]  and every late night so-called comic, they really just weaponized this info hiding behind comedy,
[02:56.840 --> 03:03.400]  called for her to be fired and then said that we put out a doctored video, which we didn't. We just
[03:03.400 --> 03:09.640]  zoomed in. But again, that's a doctored video. We just tuned in that we showed TV viewers somebody
[03:09.640 --> 03:16.040]  on the Donald Reddit, put that together where Jim Acosta knocks her out. He didn't really do that.
[03:16.040 --> 03:21.640]  That's doctored. But we put out was zoomed in for clarity, which is the opposite of doctrine.
[03:21.640 --> 03:28.120]  That on your screen is doctrine. So what's happening is everything is about to emerge.
[03:29.000 --> 03:32.120]  There's a point in this technocracy on this planetary operation
[03:34.840 --> 03:41.000]  where they can't hide it anymore. And so instead of me going, oh, look, everything I told you
[03:41.000 --> 03:47.000]  about 23 years ago has now come true, I'm going to change course with the broadcast to make a big
[03:47.000 --> 03:50.680]  announcement when we come back, a big announcement that I've really been thinking about for months,
[03:50.680 --> 03:55.000]  but I've got to announce on air and then and then implement. And I was intending to do this
[03:55.000 --> 04:00.680]  the time Trump got elected. But I'm going to do this now because I'm going to go back to our roots.
[04:01.640 --> 04:08.600]  And our roots is telling you what's coming five, 10, 15, 20 years from now, because that's really
[04:08.600 --> 04:14.680]  what the globalist fear and my ability to research their own system and research their mindset and
[04:14.680 --> 04:21.240]  research what they're building and then give you a prime projection of where you and your family
[04:21.240 --> 04:27.960]  will be if you do not try to be involved in your own destiny because you're headed towards a fork
[04:27.960 --> 04:35.640]  in the road and one allows incredible free destiny. The other is so nightmarish that I can hardly
[04:35.640 --> 04:41.160]  even force myself to look at the next level of this if we are unsuccessful. That's one reason I
[04:41.160 --> 04:50.520]  don't talk about this a lot is because it's quite frankly so horrifying that I have trouble speaking
[04:50.520 --> 04:54.840]  this into existence, but it is the enemy's plan. So I'm going to have to go ahead and tell you.
[05:00.520 --> 05:06.840]  Nourish a probiotic friendly environment in your gut with prebiotic fiber by info wars life.

[06:12.360 --> 06:19.240]  Live from Austin, Texas broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[06:19.240 --> 06:28.280]  Well, it is now absolutely confirmed, not in triplicate, not in quadruplicate,
[06:29.720 --> 06:37.480]  but with hundreds of total confirmations that the Democratic Party run by a sort of funded
[06:37.480 --> 06:45.240]  group, that's mainstream news, Miami Herald, is going to steal the governorship, the senate seat
[06:45.240 --> 06:49.160]  and a bunch of others. Anything that was close enough within a couple points they are going to
[06:49.160 --> 06:54.200]  steal everything on there. Does it matter what state law says? More trucks arrived Saturday,
[06:54.200 --> 06:59.480]  yesterday, today. They just pulled trucks in, cops walk up, people unload them, they just say get
[06:59.480 --> 07:03.640]  back. No matter what the governor says, we're taking them in and then even inside they admit,
[07:03.640 --> 07:07.400]  yeah, these are provisional ballots, we're just filling it out however we want and they're finding
[07:07.400 --> 07:12.760]  employees of the county that work for the Democrats. They're just randomly everywhere just
[07:12.760 --> 07:17.240]  walking around with boxes out of their houses, neighbors are videotaping it, people are leaving
[07:17.240 --> 07:23.960]  rental cars that are signed into the city and signed in to the Broward County Supervisor of
[07:23.960 --> 07:32.120]  elections and they're full of ballots and boxes and the remains of them. So there's a lot of busy
[07:32.760 --> 07:37.960]  beavering when you've got to basically fill out hundreds of thousands of fake ballots
[07:38.680 --> 07:46.760]  and then get those back to back to old, old Soros and his compatriots and top election experts
[07:46.760 --> 07:52.040]  across the country or like there's no doubt we've never seen it more naked except four other times
[07:52.040 --> 07:58.200]  in Broward County and she's been found in court to steal elections. I mean this is what she does
[07:59.800 --> 08:07.320]  and so this is the raw exercise of power and we as a nationalist, we as patriots,
[08:07.320 --> 08:19.240]  we're faced with a criminal engine, a criminal army who means business and so we're going to be
[08:19.240 --> 08:23.000]  getting into that coming up at the bottom of the hour and all the videos and all the proof and it's
[08:23.000 --> 08:31.000]  just mind boggling. Governor ordered the ballots and pounded that were already there, they don't
[08:31.000 --> 08:34.920]  listen to that, they don't listen to anybody, the state police say we're not lifting a finger,
[08:34.920 --> 08:39.800]  because we're going to follow the orders of Broward County supervisors, Brenda Snipes
[08:40.840 --> 08:45.640]  and so the governor just sits there with total Democrat mutiny just like Trump does
[08:46.280 --> 08:51.400]  and they just do whatever they want. So that's how the Democrats operate folks.
[08:52.680 --> 08:57.080]  Just like Obama eight years ago, a couple years ago the administration said, you know,
[08:57.080 --> 09:00.120]  I'm just saying we're going to let anybody in that can make it across the border
[09:00.840 --> 09:04.040]  and we're going to load them on Democrat party buses and ship them to God knows where
[09:04.040 --> 09:08.440]  and a lot of them ended up getting killed in sex slavery, even the Washington Post admitted all that
[09:09.480 --> 09:14.840]  but it doesn't matter, does it? Because they're in charge, they just break the law and do whatever
[09:14.840 --> 09:18.920]  they want, along comes Trump and tries to actually do something about it and tries to actually
[09:18.920 --> 09:22.840]  not let the globalists sell the country out and he's the bad guy, he's the devil, he's got to be
[09:22.840 --> 09:32.840]  destroyed because all the late night shows say so. But here's the big news, let me do it this way,
[09:32.840 --> 09:37.080]  let me make the big announcement at the next segment because I want to think about how I'm
[09:37.080 --> 09:43.880]  going to say this and it's mainly just not even a course correction for us. It's just something
[09:43.880 --> 09:48.200]  that everybody's been asking us to do, my family's been asking me to do it and it's something I know
[09:48.200 --> 09:58.280]  I need to do and it is a very, very painful to do because when I start looking into the future,
[09:58.280 --> 10:02.680]  if we don't really change course quickly,
[10:05.880 --> 10:08.520]  there's almost no point telling people that they're not going to do anything.
[10:09.560 --> 10:19.240]  Like I'm getting to the point where I think people kind of deserve what they're going to get
[10:19.240 --> 10:30.840]  and I just need to not even worry about present things. I need to worry about making sure that
[10:30.840 --> 10:38.360]  this is all on record before it all happens so that when people are begging God to kill them,
[10:41.080 --> 10:46.120]  they will remember that they were told the truth so they can make the right spiritual decision
[10:46.120 --> 10:51.480]  because that's what this is all about later. It'd be nice to save the country and it'd be
[10:51.480 --> 10:55.720]  nice to save the world and it'd be nice to turn things around and not have the brain chips and
[10:56.440 --> 11:01.000]  half the public having cancer and almost everyone being sterilized and total world government and
[11:01.000 --> 11:05.720]  by law you've got to give your three-year-old over to the local sex group to have sex with them.
[11:05.720 --> 11:10.680]  I mean that's what's all coming but you know what everybody wants to follow this stuff and
[11:10.680 --> 11:18.600]  be politically correct you're going to get to. When they're done they're going to be having sex
[11:18.600 --> 11:24.680]  with three-year-olds on stages at sports stadiums. I know they're playing
[11:26.920 --> 11:31.240]  and people say wow this is all outrageous Jones over and over again but it all comes
[11:31.240 --> 11:36.600]  true doesn't it because I'm dialed into their frequency and the reason I don't get into what
[11:36.600 --> 11:40.760]  they're really going to do to you and your family is I don't like dialing into the frequency
[11:42.680 --> 11:47.560]  but you know what I'll do it okay and I think a lot of you can dial into the frequency you can
[11:47.560 --> 11:55.160]  also just intellectually historically see where everything's going but let me tell you if you
[11:55.160 --> 12:11.080]  think it's got a bottom to it it ain't got no bottom it doesn't have a bottom
[12:11.080 --> 12:27.400]  so we're rejecting God and we're rejecting justice and we're rejecting Providence and
[12:27.400 --> 12:35.960]  we're rejecting all that's good and so there is no bottom so I'll come back and get into all that
[12:35.960 --> 12:42.600]  as best I can and then we'll get into the election fraud and then when I get into all the
[12:44.360 --> 12:47.320]  world government mark of the beast technocracy stuff
[12:49.720 --> 12:52.280]  in fact guys print me a Bloomberg article from like three years ago
[12:53.720 --> 12:58.840]  at DeBose they held a vote and they decided to call themselves a technocracy and they said we
[12:58.840 --> 13:03.560]  don't believe in elected governments we believe in giant computers we program controlling you
[13:03.560 --> 13:09.400]  with microchips then they had everybody from Bloomberg to Fox News say yes soon you'll all
[13:09.400 --> 13:14.840]  have chips it went from Jones and the Christians and people are crazy there's never going to be
[13:14.840 --> 13:18.840]  a plan to put a microchip in you there's ever going to be face scanning to buy and sell there's
[13:18.840 --> 13:25.560]  ever going to be a world government and just shut up about it I remember Fox News CNN 15 years ago
[13:25.560 --> 13:33.080]  saying I was crazy 20 years ago and now Fox News last week is of course everyone's going to have
[13:33.080 --> 13:38.280]  a chip get ready to get yours because to have a cell phone or to get on the internet or to have
[13:38.280 --> 13:43.080]  a job you're going to have to and people don't go oh my god it's the mark of the beast or even
[13:43.080 --> 13:46.760]  don't believe in god people don't go man that'll really be used to abuse people
[13:48.840 --> 13:52.680]  with a global social score that we first told you about six years ago
[13:54.680 --> 14:01.160]  no they just go okay I'll do it and then okay okay okay okay until we're going to sterilize you
[14:01.160 --> 14:07.000]  now okay we're going to wipe your memories now okay you have to worship this god okay you have to

[19:28.680 --> 19:33.880]  taking for over a year and now we believe we have come as close to perfection when it comes to a
[19:33.880 --> 19:38.440]  detoxifier as you can possibly get you want to yourself you want to your family and you owe it

[20:16.360 --> 20:26.040]  ah
[20:26.040 --> 20:34.600]  it's alex jones longing for the sun you will come to the island without me
[20:34.600 --> 20:46.280]  the longing for the sun be welcomed on the island many miles away from home be welcomed
[20:47.160 --> 20:51.320]  on the island without me the longing for the sun
[20:51.320 --> 20:59.080]  welcome back ladies and gentlemen i am your host alex jones it is the 12th day of november 2018
[20:59.080 --> 21:05.240]  on this monday all right so here's the course correction and it's not a course correction
[21:05.240 --> 21:12.200]  at all it's actually continuing on our mission i will continue to support president trump
[21:12.760 --> 21:16.520]  i will continue to support nationalist and populist movements around the world
[21:17.880 --> 21:23.320]  but trying to dodge a bullet trying to get trump in another nationalist in
[21:23.320 --> 21:28.920]  and trying to win things like these midterms is a
[21:31.960 --> 21:38.840]  pipe dream if you don't fundamentally address the globalist the world government the technocrats
[21:38.840 --> 21:44.760]  and what their in game is remember oh there isn't a world government there isn't an e u empire plan
[21:44.760 --> 21:49.080]  we're not going after nation states we're not going after your family the federal reserve is not
[21:49.080 --> 21:54.120]  private now the fellow reserves private families are bad we're gonna have a world government empire
[21:54.120 --> 21:59.240]  run out of the e u you're gonna have a microchip to buy and sell and christians are the enemy
[22:01.080 --> 22:05.240]  that's all in the news today from world leaders
[22:08.600 --> 22:13.800]  you see they've got a plan they're following a blueprint they're they're following a
[22:13.800 --> 22:22.520]  architecture diagram first they tell you that humans don't have a soul humans don't even
[22:22.520 --> 22:27.400]  have free will they've been teaching that for a hundred years uh in the colleges so you just go
[22:27.400 --> 22:31.960]  ahead and be sociopathic and just do whatever you want but virtue is signal all day to people
[22:31.960 --> 22:36.440]  that do have consciences and and control them that way we're going to teach you how to really
[22:36.440 --> 22:43.080]  be professional how to be a technocrat how to make sure you don't have that fake thing that holds
[22:43.080 --> 22:48.760]  you back called a called a soul we're going to teach you how to be superior and then you can
[22:48.760 --> 22:55.640]  sit in the seats of power once you're a good robot but you're not really a robot you're a devil
[22:55.640 --> 23:00.840]  that likes to hurt people you've now stepped into it by increment you've turned your well over
[23:00.840 --> 23:09.160]  you're under a spell and now you can try to put other people into the mindset into the groove
[23:09.160 --> 23:17.320]  so that they can stay asleep asleep and be tricked in the nightmare to go deeper down the
[23:17.320 --> 23:27.480]  rat hole deeper into the abyss as you fall fall fall fall through eternity away from god
[23:29.880 --> 23:32.600]  and so the change of course is this
[23:32.600 --> 23:40.600]  because trump is lied about because you get demonized if you stand up for trump because
[23:40.600 --> 23:45.960]  you get persecuted if you stand up for trump because he is good he is pragmatic he does
[23:45.960 --> 23:51.800]  want nation states he wants a pro-human future that's his big sin because he likes people
[23:51.800 --> 24:01.720]  and he's strong he's not satanic and because of that i totally defend him because i'm gonna go
[24:01.720 --> 24:08.280]  where the the heat is i'm gonna go where the target is i'm gonna go where the flak is
[24:10.440 --> 24:17.400]  and i've done that and i'm gonna continue to do that but most importantly is exposing the big game
[24:17.400 --> 24:23.000]  the the big plan like we did about world government and casual societies and the attack on the family
[24:23.000 --> 24:27.720]  all the other things we broke down that the surveillance grid right down to how it worked
[24:27.720 --> 24:38.520]  specifically 20 years ago from nsa whistleblowers that's really what's important is to do professional
[24:39.880 --> 24:44.440]  almost pregger u-style videos which i used to do years ago we still do some of them
[24:44.440 --> 24:52.120]  and and and films and and things like that where we really walk someone through the globalist
[24:52.120 --> 24:59.000]  own admissions and own statements where i'm not even in it that's really what i've been envisioning
[24:59.000 --> 25:05.240]  for years is moving forward to do things like that and and the globalists know that that's
[25:05.240 --> 25:13.720]  why they want to shut down now before we're able to get to that point because the credibility we
[25:13.720 --> 25:19.800]  have that so much what we said has come through they can't allow us to be here so they have to
[25:19.800 --> 25:24.920]  build a strong man and assassinate my character in my name and try to financially destroy us
[25:24.920 --> 25:29.320]  because they don't want anybody else to look at what info wars has done and this is central
[25:30.440 --> 25:36.920]  and say wow from the middle of nowhere texas standing up rebooting americana relaunching a
[25:36.920 --> 25:42.920]  belief in humans and a human future and the family and capitalism and private property which is a
[25:42.920 --> 25:50.600]  foundation in a christian society for a free society so i'm relaunching the opposite of what
[25:50.600 --> 25:55.160]  the globalists want they want monopolies they want the occult they want broken families they
[25:55.160 --> 26:02.200]  want control they want sabotage systems so they can rebuild it in whatever horrid image they want
[26:02.200 --> 26:06.600]  it's an act of total vandalism an act of total cowardice an act of complete selfishness
[26:06.600 --> 26:10.920]  and so that's where we stand here
[26:13.640 --> 26:15.000]  that it is most important
[26:20.920 --> 26:27.560]  that we make the next group of predictions and then when i make those predictions everyone will
[26:27.560 --> 26:32.360]  say oh i saw that on netflix i read that in the book that's a thousand years from now they're talking
[26:32.360 --> 26:37.240]  about that exact thing no that's predictive programming to get you ready to make you comfortable
[26:37.240 --> 26:43.320]  with it even if it's put in a dystopic format your brain will adapt and overcome and prepare
[26:43.320 --> 26:50.600]  yourself to live in the scenario it's envisioning and will start making preparations of the globalist
[26:50.600 --> 26:57.560]  incrementally culturally make preparations to insert you into it so when we come back i'll get
[26:57.560 --> 27:02.440]  into how they plan to get you and your family to not just take chips in the hand but chips in the
[27:02.440 --> 27:09.800]  brain and then we'll leap forward and look at the world in 20 years according to their plan
[27:10.760 --> 27:15.400]  and then i'll get into the current election stealing and we'll get into all the other news but
[27:16.680 --> 27:21.880]  the the the course change here the course change here is that
[27:21.880 --> 27:31.480]  i have been very political because i saw a true americana movement and one that's very successful
[27:31.480 --> 27:37.240]  and moving forward being attacked and the enemy was very very threatened by it and that's a good
[27:37.240 --> 27:42.520]  thing uh that that we backed it and it's it's stronger than ever but we have to be multi-faceted
[27:42.520 --> 27:47.400]  and get back to the actual architecture of the globalist themselves and not even make it about
[27:47.400 --> 27:52.600]  trump or even the nation state but make it about good and evil the technocracy versus free will
[27:52.600 --> 27:58.040]  the electronic prison versus the universe that's laying out ready before you we're gonna go to
[27:58.040 --> 28:02.680]  break we're gonna come back and i will get into all of this but this is the reason they want to
[28:02.680 --> 28:07.160]  shut down there are billion voices out there a million leaders and all the rest of it and that's
[28:07.160 --> 28:12.360]  great i'm not trying to be the leader i'm just telling you you're gonna get here what's actually
[28:12.360 --> 28:17.800]  going on from the enemy's perspective the i'm in their head they're in my head they know it
[28:18.680 --> 28:24.040]  and i'm willing to dial into their frequency it is not fun i mean let me tell you it's not fun
[28:24.040 --> 28:28.840]  but i'm willing to do it and they want me shut down because they know i'm in the room with them
[28:28.840 --> 28:36.360]  right now and they know it so we'll break it all down we come back it's a spiritual fight though
[28:36.360 --> 28:42.120]  they're building this big glittery matrix to try to insert you into it to trick you in it to give
[28:42.120 --> 28:47.080]  up your soul and your free will you have free will you're made the image of god you're amazing you
[28:47.080 --> 28:54.200]  have the entire potential of the universe in you don't let them steal it from you don't sell your
[28:54.200 --> 29:02.760]  soul for all this tinfoil crap you've heard the phrase you are what you eat not true actually

[31:59.800 --> 32:04.120]  the globalists know that if they suppress the good halogen and pump the environment full
[32:04.120 --> 32:09.640]  of the bad halogens fluoride chlorine bromide you name it that it lowers IQ it literally
[32:10.200 --> 32:15.240]  dumbs the population down and on our quest to bring our listeners and viewers the best iodine
[32:15.240 --> 32:21.400]  in the world we've gone through two permutations first seaweed based iodine that was pretty good
[32:21.400 --> 32:25.880]  but hard to source and the globalists tried to block us getting a supply of it so we discovered
[32:25.880 --> 32:31.800]  deep earth crystals of pure nascent iodine and brought you x2 that's been incredible now due
[32:31.800 --> 32:36.680]  to the establishment trying to block that we did more research and secured more of the deep
[32:36.680 --> 32:41.880]  earth crystals of nascent iodine but chemists scientists and others showed us the research
[32:41.880 --> 32:48.680]  that by combining it with three other compounds two forms of iodine and vitamin c it super charges it
[32:48.680 --> 32:54.680]  and makes it even more bio available ladies and gentlemen you want to research it you want to see
[32:54.680 --> 32:59.400]  it it's an incredible discovery x3 now available at m4slife.com
[33:02.760 --> 33:05.400]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[33:05.400 --> 33:07.400]  so
[33:17.000 --> 33:25.480]  discover trends and global developments years before they happen right here on the alex jones show
[33:27.080 --> 33:31.240]  so imagine we're a ship out in the sea or a ship flying to a distant star system
[33:31.240 --> 33:42.120]  and we're on a original course but we deviate off that course on the mission because
[33:43.640 --> 33:48.760]  there's a place we want to visit there's something we want to do that actually may help us get where
[33:48.760 --> 33:56.200]  we're going quicker and safer and better and that's nationalism that's patriotism that's rebooting the
[33:56.200 --> 34:02.200]  bill of rights the constitution returning national sovereignty because the global government wants
[34:02.200 --> 34:07.400]  to get rid of nations it wants to get rid of people having any type of political system that
[34:07.400 --> 34:12.120]  speaks for them that could challenge the illegitimate dictatorial authority of the global
[34:12.120 --> 34:18.680]  corporatist crony state and that's why macron and others are openly attacking the the existence of
[34:18.680 --> 34:24.840]  a nation we're going to get to that in a few minutes so when i say import wars is setting a new
[34:24.840 --> 34:31.640]  course i'm saying we're getting back on our original course in that i've gotten so into the
[34:31.640 --> 34:37.880]  minutiae of the daily news and so into the minutiae of defending trump and other nationalists when
[34:37.880 --> 34:44.200]  people lie about them that the establishment and the controlled corporate media is able to trick us
[34:45.080 --> 34:50.840]  to make them relevant again by doing outrageous things and telling outrageous lies and a certain
[34:50.840 --> 34:56.120]  point of jim acosta says trump took out the martin luther king bust or didn't visit congressman's
[34:56.120 --> 35:00.360]  police in the hospital a certain point we got to go that's a liar i'm not even responding
[35:01.800 --> 35:06.600]  and i know it's too hard we have to respond but that's a tactic of them getting more and more
[35:07.640 --> 35:15.000]  outrageous to lure and to suck us back in so when i say i'm getting back on our original
[35:15.000 --> 35:19.320]  course i'm bigger for trump than ever and especially when people tell me don't do it
[35:19.320 --> 35:23.000]  and i get persecuted for it and we see the country coming back from the dead and people
[35:23.000 --> 35:28.040]  would listen to trump and other nationalists we have a lot better future for humanity but if we
[35:28.040 --> 35:33.480]  just let the globalists make trump the issue instead of the imf the world bank the communist
[35:33.480 --> 35:40.360]  chinese uh the debauched group calling for a planetary technocracy and a dictatorship if we
[35:40.360 --> 35:46.120]  don't spend time going after them on the offense and instead are defending that trump's really good
[35:46.120 --> 35:51.400]  and alex jones is really good and you know that video of a cost is real when it's obviously real
[35:51.400 --> 35:57.720]  we didn't doctor it it becomes this system where they are able to change the subject off of the
[35:57.720 --> 36:06.440]  really bad stuff they're doing so i never really changed course i just understand i need to drill
[36:06.440 --> 36:11.560]  into the actual documents of what fluoride does to your brain your body i need to drill into the
[36:11.560 --> 36:17.000]  actual documents of what g5 and other wireless systems are doing on record i need to expose
[36:17.000 --> 36:22.520]  the technocracy ai takeover plan and how it's making people obsolete and literally making us
[36:22.520 --> 36:27.720]  obsolete because it turns us into jellyfish where everything's handled for us like we're on some
[36:27.720 --> 36:33.800]  cruise ship in the movie walley but the globalists never planned to let us get to that level we're
[36:33.800 --> 36:39.080]  only having everything done for us because they're preparing to remove us and that really is
[36:39.080 --> 36:47.080]  the big issue here that is so incredible it bottles the mind now
[36:50.040 --> 36:55.960]  i always prove everything i say and it becomes a little neurotic that i'm sitting here wanting
[36:55.960 --> 37:02.200]  to get into the eu and the world government plan and the rest of it and then here i am getting all
[37:02.200 --> 37:06.520]  the documents and all the articles together to prove what i've been saying for 20 years that's
[37:06.520 --> 37:12.200]  now come true what's the point of proving what's already been proven to be true but it is what i'm
[37:12.200 --> 37:22.360]  going to do because when you see what macron said and you see our own media our own enemy media
[37:22.360 --> 37:33.160]  the globalist media they are the enemies of prosperity they are the enemies of us controlling
[37:33.160 --> 37:40.120]  our own destinies and that's just a fact and trump would be a liar if he came out and didn't say
[37:40.120 --> 37:48.520]  anything else and so of course we're talking about congressional investigations into his war
[37:48.520 --> 37:56.280]  on the press cnn msnbc and the new york times are at war with the press and free speech obama
[37:56.280 --> 38:03.640]  arrested hundreds of reporters unlike any other president ever who would expose criminal
[38:03.640 --> 38:07.960]  things he was doing he went after whistleblowers you name it there was a reign of terror trumps
[38:07.960 --> 38:16.200]  done nothing like that zero but they turn him into the authoritarian when it's cnn lobbying
[38:16.200 --> 38:21.800]  to not have my books published harassing my sponsors uh getting us taken off platforms
[38:21.800 --> 38:28.920]  and celebrating it and then they file a lawsuit saying trump is a dictator because he won't let
[38:28.920 --> 38:41.080]  jim acosta scream three questions at him and manhandle a woman so
[38:45.880 --> 38:50.600]  we have to really get people to understand the average trump supporter it's great to go to trump
[38:50.600 --> 38:57.160]  rally but you're really being contained there you you should be going to your city council and
[38:57.160 --> 39:02.040]  your church you should really be warning people and you should be really involved in your community
[39:03.080 --> 39:11.720]  actually exposing the big picture you know when trump had the rallies coupled with the internet
[39:11.720 --> 39:16.200]  and coupled with his supporters and nationalists spreading the word it was an unstoppable force
[39:16.200 --> 39:24.920]  globally but with the censorship coming in on a planetary scale we must do several things
[39:24.920 --> 39:31.400]  lobby trump put pressure on trump give trump support and other nationalists to go after the
[39:31.400 --> 39:37.800]  censors but we can't just sit there and count on trump is what i'm saying
[39:37.800 --> 39:48.600]  to get it all done for us we have to do it it isn't vote every two years it isn't
[39:48.600 --> 39:52.360]  you know just talk to your buddies around the dinner table we have to decide that we really
[39:52.360 --> 39:56.280]  care about our children and their children's future and that we don't want to be in a
[39:59.160 --> 40:03.320]  electronic matrix that is literally being built for us and that's what i'm getting out here
[40:03.320 --> 40:09.400]  so i haven't got to any clips yet we'll we'll we'll come back and get to all the world government
[40:09.400 --> 40:13.880]  clips and the market the beast clips and plan unveiled to microchip hundreds of thousands
[40:13.880 --> 40:20.360]  of uk employees at major companies the linen guardian you know says insiders are totally
[40:20.360 --> 40:23.640]  freaked out that the big banks are rolling ahead with the plan and after that they're
[40:23.640 --> 40:33.400]  going to implant customers that's just the beginning so it's all it's all here it's all happening
[40:36.520 --> 40:41.080]  and you look at someplace like venezuela or somewhere else that's totally collapsed
[40:41.080 --> 40:46.760]  and you say why is it collapsed you know communists can't manage anything it's a spirit
[40:48.040 --> 40:52.600]  it's meant to create poverty and death and collapse and sewage running down the streets
[40:52.600 --> 41:01.960]  it's death that's what they want it's what they do on purpose
[41:06.360 --> 41:12.120]  globalism communism all these systems are false paradigms that the globalists set off shore and
[41:12.120 --> 41:17.800]  control that are meant to render you down they're meant to suck your culture out and destroy you
[41:17.800 --> 41:22.120]  ahead of the digital takeover
[41:24.840 --> 41:30.440]  that's what world government is it's what liberalism is in the modern sense the modern leftist movement
[41:30.440 --> 41:36.120]  is about having no culture it's about being a horrible little wicked twisted person

[47:24.200 --> 47:41.960]  so when i say that i'm about to change course i mean that we're about to get back on our original
[47:41.960 --> 47:49.560]  course exposing globalism exposing the world government program and telling people what's
[47:49.560 --> 47:55.880]  coming in the future so that when they see it happen later they remember and know they were
[47:55.880 --> 48:02.600]  told the truth about what's coming next after that folks will never listen about what's going
[48:02.600 --> 48:08.680]  to come in the near future or even the distant future but when they then learn that they were
[48:08.680 --> 48:16.120]  told the truth 20 years before 30 years before they'll start listening and then they'll go and hear
[48:16.120 --> 48:22.360]  what you or others are saying at the time because those that control the past control the future
[48:22.920 --> 48:29.960]  those that control the present control the future there is a technocracy that's decided your trash
[48:30.600 --> 48:38.200]  that's decided to get rid of you just decided to bring in an anti human future and trump and other
[48:38.200 --> 48:44.200]  nationalists are just trying to go back to the renaissance that was really the future of a pro
[48:44.200 --> 48:49.480]  human system the globalists are going to use technology and suppressive systems to go back
[48:49.480 --> 48:56.360]  to feudalism for the high tech overlay i am simply stating that getting nationalists in and fighting
[48:56.360 --> 49:03.080]  the globalists is important but we can't put all of our energy in constantly fighting those
[49:03.080 --> 49:10.760]  politicized battles we have to move past that at many levels and speak directly to people
[49:10.760 --> 49:16.360]  regardless of what party they're in or what group they're in the problem is they'd already
[49:16.360 --> 49:20.040]  so balkanized people that trump had to teach us we were nationalists and that we could have an
[49:20.040 --> 49:25.080]  identity or we'd be bullied into the globalist identity so it's good to have those different
[49:25.080 --> 49:32.280]  identities but the nationalist identity is important but it's not really the compendium of the free
[49:32.280 --> 49:39.960]  human identity and the big master plan of the globalist versus the free will universe
[49:41.880 --> 49:46.440]  so i'm going to get into the world government i'm going to get into the future technologies the
[49:46.440 --> 49:52.440]  current suppressed technologies the the system they're going to set up and develop if they're
[49:52.440 --> 50:01.720]  successful where we're going the destination that we are tracking on because i have gotten away
[50:01.720 --> 50:07.240]  from info wars roots doing an hour with doctors and scientists on just about fluoride or an hour
[50:07.240 --> 50:13.880]  on vaccines or an hour on gmo or an hour on rockefeller foundation documents or an hour on
[50:13.880 --> 50:20.440]  ecoscience uh or an hour on transhumanist the plan to end the family you're like well okay now
[50:20.440 --> 50:24.680]  all that stuff you said 20 years ago and 10 years ago it's come true you've got some credibility
[50:24.680 --> 50:30.840]  that's why they're censoring you well let's go to what's coming next and where they're going
[50:30.840 --> 50:35.400]  to take us next because i don't go there because the study of it
[50:38.120 --> 50:43.640]  is so horrifying that we're now almost there that even i
[50:45.960 --> 50:49.880]  just want to go eat a big plate of enchiladas and go home and get in the hot tub
[50:49.880 --> 50:57.080]  and go watch netflix and just forget it do you know what that's giving up my free will and turning
[50:57.080 --> 51:01.560]  the universe over to some really bad people so we've we've had our consciousness already hijacked
[51:02.680 --> 51:09.000]  and it's going to get a lot worse folks and so i really want to move back into consciousness
[51:09.000 --> 51:11.240]  and thinking outside the box and
[51:15.240 --> 51:21.640]  transcending the political class now trump has tried to do that and trump is great
[51:21.640 --> 51:29.800]  but what i'm getting at here is the main mission is to warn people about how evil the globalists are
[51:30.920 --> 51:35.720]  and if you don't even have trump in that debate it's much easier because people have been polarized
[51:35.720 --> 51:40.920]  but if you actually go to what david rock of valor and macron
[51:42.440 --> 51:47.960]  and others are saying it's outrageous and if you actually go to the history of it it's even more
[51:47.960 --> 51:58.520]  outrageous i said last week over and over again the eu is a private corporate empire set up by
[51:58.520 --> 52:12.520]  the nazis in 1942 taken over by the marshal program in 1945 and now administered but adopting the
[52:12.520 --> 52:19.240]  whole future nazi plan of space stations and the space shuttle and atomic weapons and all of that
[52:19.240 --> 52:27.400]  was the nazi plan it was a blueprint for the future so when you see macron come out and say the most
[52:27.400 --> 52:32.680]  unpatriotic thing you can do is to be a nationalist that's like saying the most horrible thing a
[52:32.680 --> 52:40.440]  mother can do is give birth to her baby and give it milk you know the worst thing a mama duck can
[52:40.440 --> 52:46.520]  do is feed her baby duck it's literally saying black as white white as black you say that doesn't
[52:46.520 --> 52:52.200]  make sense they're doing it on purpose everywhere when they show look at this edited video and it
[52:52.200 --> 52:57.720]  shows our video and the other video and ours isn't edited it's just zoomed in but they say can you
[52:57.720 --> 53:08.280]  believe it fire sarah how can be standards it's an act of sabotaging reality it's an act of training
[53:08.280 --> 53:11.960]  you that they're the authority and they're going to hijack reality and they're going to tell you
[53:11.960 --> 53:23.080]  how it really works it's mind-blowing so when i start the next hour i'm going to play
[53:25.800 --> 53:30.280]  all the clips i've got here of macron and others and i'm going to read from even mainstream news
[53:30.280 --> 53:37.960]  the nazi eu history it's funny i put that in in game and it never been any newspapers
[53:39.720 --> 53:44.680]  until i put it in in game and then people went and looked it up and found it was true
[53:49.880 --> 53:54.840]  of course you know how we were able to find that right um out of the national archives a
[53:54.840 --> 54:00.920]  several senators had their private papers stolen by patriots and give it to me
[54:04.360 --> 54:08.040]  i got some very serious death threats over that one end of visit
[54:10.840 --> 54:17.000]  but i said you want to go ahead and indict me for this i didn't do it a b imagine i'm indicted for
[54:17.000 --> 54:28.040]  what's in these it'll draw attention to them the whole nazi plan and i'm not saying the
[54:28.040 --> 54:33.720]  globalists are nazis they're even worse the nazis were like an offshoot to try to accelerate the plan
[54:33.720 --> 54:37.560]  and and and well hell we're not going to wait 50 years implement this we'll do this now
[54:40.120 --> 54:44.360]  and we're not going to have it where everybody gets exterminated we'll just kill everybody but the
[54:44.360 --> 54:52.840]  but the but the aerians this is how the world works this is the course they set for everybody
[54:52.840 --> 54:59.720]  and i'm here saying we might want to set a different course the nazi science fiction land
[55:01.960 --> 55:08.200]  then they try to equate trump with nazism and with war because he's a nationalist
[55:09.240 --> 55:14.280]  even though hitler wanted to in nation states and have a global empire to quote stop war
[55:14.280 --> 55:17.480]  which is the same thing the rockefellers wanted but all it does is start wars
[55:18.840 --> 55:21.400]  so here he is saying nationalism is bad
[55:26.440 --> 55:32.600]  and then he comes out and so this is finance minister and says we need a total empire and we
[55:32.600 --> 55:37.480]  need a military to stop people leaving the eu that they never voted to be in
[55:39.400 --> 55:43.320]  what's that called never voted to be in it and there's going to be a military that keeps you in it
[55:43.320 --> 55:51.640]  a military dictatorship the worst type so france is announcing a military dictatorship and an empire
[55:51.640 --> 55:58.520]  to stop anyone leaving and to absorb neighboring states and then the news says trump opposes it
[55:58.520 --> 56:03.640]  because he's a fascist and a nazi when trump is literally
[56:03.640 --> 56:12.920]  opposing a brainchild of the nazi state and a fascist empire
[56:14.360 --> 56:23.080]  a paramilitary fascist empire run by the unelected grandson of the richest royal house
[56:23.080 --> 56:34.280]  in deutschland the youngsters you cannot make it up truth is more fantastical than you can
[56:34.280 --> 56:41.560]  ever imagine here's macron saying we live an upside down world this vision of france
[56:41.560 --> 56:47.560]  has a generous nation with a vision which carries universal values has been in those
[56:47.560 --> 56:54.920]  dark times exactly the opposite of the selfishness of a people which only looks at its own interests
[56:55.800 --> 57:03.480]  because patriotism is the exact opposite of nationalism nationalism is its betrayal
[57:04.440 --> 57:11.400]  by pursuing our own interests first with no regard to others we erase the very thing that
[57:11.400 --> 57:18.120]  the nation holds most precious that which gives it life and makes it great its moral values
[57:20.360 --> 57:27.400]  the EU pays no taxes the EU's dictatorial the EU helped finance the arab spring that took over
[57:27.400 --> 57:33.480]  and and murdered people in mass the EU had you have no rights under the EU at least those former
[57:33.480 --> 57:38.520]  nation states have some basic rights they're dissolving your country into an empire and calling
[57:38.520 --> 57:46.520]  it loving and liberal unbelievable there it is the EU's architects nazis and nazi collaborators

[59:53.160 --> 1:00:06.120]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[1:00:06.120 --> 1:00:17.400]  defending the republic from enemies foreign and domestic it's alex jones i want to be clear
[1:00:19.560 --> 1:00:26.360]  i can take this broadcast in any direction i want and i'm constantly mad at myself so i'm
[1:00:26.360 --> 1:00:31.400]  trying to ask the listeners what they think maybe open the phones about what we could do better because
[1:00:31.400 --> 1:00:35.720]  we've got the globalist attention we're over the target we know what we're doing but
[1:00:36.840 --> 1:00:43.080]  how do you even sit here when a private world government that's anti-humans being set up
[1:00:44.760 --> 1:00:51.480]  and that's so evil in its own admission and then the public is so decadent and so dumbed down they
[1:00:51.480 --> 1:00:56.040]  believe mainstream media at least a large part of them and don't even care about their own future
[1:00:56.040 --> 1:01:02.280]  it's a fact that they give you polio through the polio vaccine that take 10 hours to get into
[1:01:02.920 --> 1:01:07.480]  but i'm an expert on it my grandmother got it from the polio vaccine the doctor told her that
[1:01:08.680 --> 1:01:17.160]  in the 1950s it's a fact that all these people getting polio-like diseases in the us got it after
[1:01:17.160 --> 1:01:28.280]  they took the polio vaccine it happens all the world it's a fact that measles mumps and rubella
[1:01:28.280 --> 1:01:33.800]  is popping up when people get vaccinated and again they go oh jones doesn't believe that
[1:01:35.000 --> 1:01:39.240]  learned immunity from a vaccinations reel he doesn't believe in electricity either
[1:01:39.240 --> 1:01:45.960]  that's the leftist thing like you don't believe in science no i know about artificially learning
[1:01:45.960 --> 1:01:52.520]  immunity under the whole history of vaccination going back 600 years with smallpox and using a stick
[1:01:52.520 --> 1:01:57.560]  to punch into the pustules and then give it to a healthy person because they found if you got sick
[1:01:57.560 --> 1:02:01.960]  when you were healthy that you you lived most the time but normally you'd get sick when you were
[1:02:01.960 --> 1:02:09.320]  already run down and so you would die i mean they they were pretty smart but they'd come and tell you
[1:02:10.120 --> 1:02:14.440]  the apothecary of the doctor would tell the husband and wife we give this to your kids
[1:02:14.440 --> 1:02:19.800]  it about a five percent chance they're going to die 20 30 percent chance they're going to die if they
[1:02:20.440 --> 1:02:29.080]  don't take this and then later get it themselves but it was definitely taking your life in your
[1:02:29.080 --> 1:02:34.360]  hands they don't tell you that now folks they tell you safe and effective never hurt anybody
[1:02:34.360 --> 1:02:38.680]  and you read the vaccine it says it'll kill you deader than a hammer sometimes it'll give you
[1:02:38.680 --> 1:02:45.320]  guion berets narcolepsy epilepsy and then i read the newspaper every year before school starts
[1:02:45.880 --> 1:02:53.000]  every newspaper says don't believe the conspiracy theorists like jones you know the known hoaxer
[1:02:54.680 --> 1:03:00.040]  and they'll list some strawman things i didn't do he says you know vaccines can damage you
[1:03:00.040 --> 1:03:02.280]  but worse you'll get a sore arm
[1:03:02.280 --> 1:03:09.400]  unless you're my dad's brother who almost died from a tetanus shot and they told him it was
[1:03:09.400 --> 1:03:14.040]  the tetanus shot or my grandma who got polio who just died last year at 90 years 97 years old
[1:03:14.040 --> 1:03:18.680]  who they told her she got it from it or all the admissions and i mean it's it's it's frustrating
[1:03:20.440 --> 1:03:24.360]  and so we have a responsibility to go out and warn people because now all over the world they're
[1:03:24.360 --> 1:03:32.520]  passing laws where you got to take vaccines and they're passing laws in places like mexico they
[1:03:32.520 --> 1:03:38.520]  have regulations that if you work for the justice department you've got to take a microchip that
[1:03:38.520 --> 1:03:47.800]  happened 15 years ago you know as best guess estimate i know of right now there's probably about
[1:03:48.840 --> 1:03:50.920]  10 million people that got microchips
[1:03:50.920 --> 1:04:00.760]  i was told by family who was in army class fighter is obviously uh it was told at an
[1:04:00.760 --> 1:04:10.760]  officers conference of over a thousand officers this was 12 years ago that higher-ups who already
[1:04:10.760 --> 1:04:14.760]  got in the chip you're going to be getting the chip don't tell anybody about it but i was told
[1:04:14.760 --> 1:04:24.920]  about it and they even figured it out and he got in trouble and got passed over for promotion
[1:04:24.920 --> 1:04:31.320]  i was told by keep your mouth shut about the microchips so let me tell you
[1:04:34.120 --> 1:04:42.840]  we're not in kansas anymore we're going to talk about that as well when we come back

[1:06:24.200 --> 1:06:29.640]  most demonized most line about most dreaded broadcast in the world by globalist by crony
[1:06:29.640 --> 1:06:37.720]  capitalist by pedophiles by devil worshipers and by all their forms of scum they are moving
[1:06:37.720 --> 1:06:44.040]  mountains to shut us down and now they're moving to shut a lot of other folks down you know i haven't
[1:06:44.040 --> 1:06:53.640]  gotten into a really key point about the new uh interim attorney general mr wittaker but if the
[1:06:53.640 --> 1:07:03.720]  crew will remind me i will get into some of that coming up at the bottom of the hour and then we're
[1:07:03.720 --> 1:07:09.640]  joined by jim hoft the gateway pundit with a lot of them incredible breakdowns of what's happening
[1:07:09.640 --> 1:07:16.920]  with the ongoing public theft of the governorship the senate seat and other close races uh as more
[1:07:16.920 --> 1:07:23.880]  trucks arrived illegally it was publicly illegal uh and and and just offload them and george soros's
[1:07:23.880 --> 1:07:29.640]  uh think tank group is running it that's in the news so it's just the pure raw criminal
[1:07:30.360 --> 1:07:35.880]  exercise of power by a woman that's done it over and over again and that's just the way it is
[1:07:35.880 --> 1:07:42.360]  the governor ordered the uh balance impounded last week state police said we're not moving a finger
[1:07:46.360 --> 1:07:52.840]  because you see that's how these tyrannies work all these people are told you just roll over you
[1:07:52.840 --> 1:07:58.200]  just go along and you'll be left alone with the drop as well just don't make waves we'll all become
[1:07:58.200 --> 1:08:09.320]  venezuela together so that's coming up but but since i mentioned this let me let me get to this now
[1:08:12.680 --> 1:08:21.560]  there are major corporate consortiums that have spent what i know of billions of dollars
[1:08:21.560 --> 1:08:31.880]  uh conditioning the public since the mid 1990s that in the future everyone will take implantable
[1:08:31.880 --> 1:08:43.000]  microchips in their hand or in their scalp of their head they've also spent billions promoting
[1:08:43.000 --> 1:08:47.480]  cash is dirty get rid of it because once you've got some kind of cashless society once everybody
[1:08:47.480 --> 1:08:52.760]  trusts it you can start controlling people you can start giving people perks if they submit to
[1:08:52.760 --> 1:08:57.880]  certain political or cultural operations like being sterilized or worshiping a certain god
[1:08:57.880 --> 1:09:04.280]  or doing a certain thing it's social control the global social score and then they use these front
[1:09:04.280 --> 1:09:10.200]  companies to come out and promote how great it is all over the news because the big tech companies
[1:09:10.200 --> 1:09:16.920]  and the big banks that are running them don't want to get in trouble with christians and just
[1:09:16.920 --> 1:09:21.960]  smart people that obviously understand that if you have an implantable microchip you're like a
[1:09:21.960 --> 1:09:26.600]  trackable dog under their control and that's just the beginning of the whole transhumanist movement
[1:09:26.600 --> 1:09:35.800]  but now in the last year like artillery before there's an infantry invasion thousands and
[1:09:35.800 --> 1:09:42.520]  thousands and thousands of articles fox news cnn msnbc london guardian their spiegel even russian
[1:09:42.520 --> 1:09:49.400]  newspapers soon everyone will have chips and there's nothing you can do about it soon your
[1:09:49.400 --> 1:09:54.120]  children will have brain chips and demand they get them and there'll be laws that by age five they
[1:09:54.120 --> 1:10:01.480]  can have the augmentation even if you say no so everything we could envision on the track we were
[1:10:01.480 --> 1:10:12.920]  on is now here and suddenly the big guns stopped they went from you will submit to it's here
[1:10:14.680 --> 1:10:24.040]  and so now they're in our face telling us that it's that it's here and so thousands and thousands
[1:10:24.040 --> 1:10:28.840]  of articles are out today i looked at dozens of them and all of them but the guardian are positive
[1:10:28.840 --> 1:10:34.840]  oh it's so wonderful oh you're going to accept it oh it's the coolest thing oh it's and everybody
[1:10:34.840 --> 1:10:39.880]  that's doing it has body modification and tats and you know the big earrings everything which
[1:10:39.880 --> 1:10:47.640]  is fine if you want that the point is wash tech which was a defunct magazine put up with a wash
[1:10:47.640 --> 1:10:59.160]  and post in the 90s had several articles with the cia in it saying to the tech leaders we are pushing
[1:10:59.160 --> 1:11:06.600]  the body modification movement as part of the trans movement the transhumanist movement we're
[1:11:06.600 --> 1:11:11.720]  going to start with sex changes and body modification and once that's accepted we're going to roll out
[1:11:11.720 --> 1:11:17.400]  brain chips chips in the body chips in the hand castle society but our real goal is to get everybody
[1:11:17.400 --> 1:11:28.120]  ready for on-demand clones dogs cats your ex-wife you human organs grown in cows it's all there
[1:11:31.160 --> 1:11:34.440]  so see they come out in establishment publications that are more
[1:11:36.040 --> 1:11:43.000]  for the geek mindset and they tell you everything occasionally can only one article they come out
[1:11:43.000 --> 1:11:49.320]  every few years well maybe one or two articles that are test balloons i saw one in the baltimore
[1:11:49.320 --> 1:11:55.000]  sun 20 years ago and it said darpa and the cia are testing through the cell towers in
[1:11:55.560 --> 1:12:00.920]  areas of maryland a calming frequency found to make people happier and not commit crime
[1:12:04.840 --> 1:12:09.240]  i covered that article probably 20 times had the print out they later removed it couldn't
[1:12:09.240 --> 1:12:13.240]  find it on the way back machine now i already know about the patents and the whole deal but
[1:12:13.880 --> 1:12:22.600]  one article talking to darpa about we've put up mind control towers just to see how you'd behave
[1:12:22.600 --> 1:12:28.440]  when you read that so a little test balloon a little market test so that's how we know where
[1:12:28.440 --> 1:12:35.720]  this is all going and so now oh a big consortium of banks and british government companies
[1:12:35.720 --> 1:12:42.920]  companies that carry out british government uh task contracts said if you work for us you're
[1:12:42.920 --> 1:12:49.400]  going to get a chip and the guardian said that scares people about human rights and tracking and
[1:12:51.000 --> 1:12:56.520]  we know it's inevitable it's always inevitable it's inevitable like in science fiction we are
[1:12:56.520 --> 1:13:02.520]  the board you will assimilate or be destroyed you will be assimilated submit submit in fact
[1:13:02.520 --> 1:13:09.480]  let's play that club here it is we are bored you will be assimilated
[1:13:12.360 --> 1:13:26.760]  i am locutus of bored resistance is futile your life as it has been is over from this time forward
[1:13:26.760 --> 1:13:39.960]  you will service us you will be assimilated resistance is futile
[1:13:47.800 --> 1:13:52.040]  if you look at elon musk you had his company and things destroyed because he dared speak up
[1:13:52.040 --> 1:13:56.200]  there's an example everyone he said i go to these big tech conferences and all they talk about while
[1:13:56.200 --> 1:14:00.680]  they're micro dosing on mushrooms and lsd is how they're going to merge with the machine
[1:14:00.680 --> 1:14:05.320]  and give their bodies up and then it's in the newspapers you have to die before you become a mortal
[1:14:07.880 --> 1:14:10.760]  as if you can't just transfer a copy yourself that's going to be a fraud too
[1:14:11.800 --> 1:14:16.840]  you see but oh no you have to die to do it they're here folks it's happening
[1:14:19.160 --> 1:14:23.720]  and silicon valley believes they're getting interdimensional instructions while they're on
[1:14:23.720 --> 1:14:30.040]  dmt from space aliens to build all this i'm not the one saying that
[1:14:31.960 --> 1:14:37.880]  i'm not the one saying that this is not me this is who runs things this is they won't give ipads
[1:14:37.880 --> 1:14:40.840]  and iphone to their kids in silicon valley but they want you to
[1:14:46.520 --> 1:14:48.040]  we're going to go to break ladies and gentlemen
[1:14:48.040 --> 1:14:50.040]  um
[1:14:50.040 --> 1:15:16.040]  our champions made of here's a man who can show you
[1:15:16.040 --> 1:15:26.040]  four
[1:15:56.040 --> 1:16:00.960]  What if there was a social media network only for the conservatives?
[1:16:00.960 --> 1:16:04.960]  What if there was a social media network not only for the conservative right general public
[1:16:04.960 --> 1:16:08.280]  but also a platform for conservative politicians and advertisers?
[1:16:08.280 --> 1:16:13.200]  And what if the social media network was the only free speech network in existence?
[1:16:13.200 --> 1:16:14.200]  There is.

[1:16:26.600 --> 1:16:30.800]  In these uncertain times, it makes sense to have a sustainable backup method to cook
[1:16:30.800 --> 1:16:32.000]  food and boil water.
[1:16:32.000 --> 1:16:36.680]  If your current plan includes using a fuel-burning stove or cooking over an open fire, then there's

[1:16:58.640 --> 1:17:04.080]  That's the sound of a house being trashed while a gang of thieves ransacked the place.
[1:17:04.080 --> 1:17:07.080]  And what they don't steal will be destroyed.
[1:17:07.080 --> 1:17:10.560]  This year, resolve not to be the next victim of a break-in.

[1:19:01.960 --> 1:19:10.080]  full of the bad halogens, fluoride, chlorine, bromide, you name it, that it lowers IQ, it
[1:19:10.080 --> 1:19:11.080]  literally dumbs the population down.
[1:19:11.080 --> 1:19:14.240]  And on our quest to bring our listeners and viewers, the best iodine in the world, we've
[1:19:14.240 --> 1:19:17.000]  gone through two permutations.
[1:19:17.000 --> 1:19:21.160]  First seaweed-based iodine that was pretty good, but hard to source, and the globalists
[1:19:21.160 --> 1:19:23.080]  tried to block us getting a supply of it.
[1:19:23.080 --> 1:19:28.160]  So we discovered deep earth crystals, a pure nascent iodine, and brought UX2 that's been
[1:19:28.160 --> 1:19:29.160]  incredible.
[1:19:29.160 --> 1:19:33.960]  But now, due to the establishment trying to block that, we did more research and secured
[1:19:33.960 --> 1:19:36.560]  more of the deep earth crystals of nascent iodine.
[1:19:36.560 --> 1:19:41.000]  But chemists, scientists, and others showed us the research that by combining it with
[1:19:41.000 --> 1:19:47.080]  three other compounds, two forms of iodine and vitamin C, it supercharges it and makes
[1:19:47.080 --> 1:19:50.480]  it even more bioavailable.
[1:19:50.480 --> 1:19:53.640]  Ladies and gentlemen, you want to research it, you want to see it, it's an incredible
[1:19:53.640 --> 1:19:54.640]  discovery.
[1:19:54.640 --> 1:20:01.360]  This is Alex Jones on X3, now available at m4slife.com.
[1:20:01.360 --> 1:20:13.640]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[1:20:13.640 --> 1:20:30.920]  Waging War on Corruption, it's Alex Jones.
[1:20:30.920 --> 1:20:37.200]  Here's the bad news, a technocracy of global social engineers are competing with each other
[1:20:37.200 --> 1:20:42.520]  for control of the planet, but they're in pretty much group alignment on the future
[1:20:42.520 --> 1:20:44.760]  of humanity, which is obsolescence.
[1:20:44.760 --> 1:20:49.360]  I made the film Endgame showing the proof of that 11 years ago, I probably should make
[1:20:49.360 --> 1:20:53.760]  another one with an update.
[1:20:53.760 --> 1:20:59.440]  The good news is, if info wars and other liberty lovers around the world could expose global
[1:20:59.440 --> 1:21:07.120]  government, expose the anti-human agenda of the globalist, and speak out against it even
[1:21:07.120 --> 1:21:12.680]  though money-wise and propaganda-wise they have more power than us 100 to 1, we're seeing
[1:21:12.680 --> 1:21:22.680]  victory through elections and prosperity come rushing back into areas where we've had limited
[1:21:22.680 --> 1:21:23.680]  victories.
[1:21:23.680 --> 1:21:29.720]  That's why Trump's so frustrated is that he clearly is trying to give you a better deal
[1:21:29.720 --> 1:21:33.680]  and trying to not let the globalist do one side of deals to siphon off our wealth and
[1:21:33.680 --> 1:21:38.840]  power, not to help the world, but to build their technocracy.
[1:21:38.840 --> 1:21:43.440]  You know, Macron's saying it's very immoral to care about your nation, a patriot only
[1:21:43.440 --> 1:21:47.000]  lovingly cares about the world, you mean give all your money, your power, your energy to
[1:21:47.000 --> 1:21:52.080]  an unelected empire, and now his top minister came out and said, yeah, we want an empire
[1:21:52.080 --> 1:21:58.000]  with an army and a military, a navy to stop anybody leaving the EU, while an unelected
[1:21:58.000 --> 1:22:05.880]  group with a paramilitary control, that's called a military dictatorship.
[1:22:05.880 --> 1:22:11.200]  But under this alchemy now, Europe should become an empire, says French finance minister,
[1:22:11.200 --> 1:22:13.960]  that's his really run in France.
[1:22:13.960 --> 1:22:19.040]  The same minister is at Davos a few years ago said, we're a technocracy, we're going
[1:22:19.040 --> 1:22:25.200]  to get rid of people's national sovereignty, and so who's running the PR in Fox News and
[1:22:25.200 --> 1:22:30.800]  CNN and ABC News that soon everyone will have a microchip, soon you won't be able to buy
[1:22:30.800 --> 1:22:35.640]  or sell without them, soon there will be a global social score already tested in China
[1:22:35.640 --> 1:22:40.720]  that face scans and thumb scans and controls you, and if you don't play ball, you don't
[1:22:40.720 --> 1:22:48.560]  buy or sell, you die, oh it's so liberal.
[1:22:48.560 --> 1:22:54.600]  Executing Christians in Falun Gong, Buddhist because they believe in God, they don't believe
[1:22:54.600 --> 1:23:02.440]  in the silicon God, beware those that worship silicon gods, Elon Musk, Elon Musk, you will
[1:23:02.440 --> 1:23:10.480]  be destroyed, yep, the EU wants a super state justice Hitler did, that's even the London
[1:23:10.480 --> 1:23:19.280]  Telegraph because it's the truth, look at these articles, plan unveiled the microchip
[1:23:19.280 --> 1:23:27.080]  hundreds of thousands of UK companies, hundreds of thousands of employees at major companies,
[1:23:27.080 --> 1:23:32.920]  alarm over talks to implant UK employees with microchips, getting you ready, you will be
[1:23:32.920 --> 1:23:42.000]  chipped eventually, USA Today, major UK companies preparing to microchip employees, the Telegraph,
[1:23:42.000 --> 1:23:46.200]  plan unveiled a microchip hundreds of thousands of UK employees at major companies, one company
[1:23:46.200 --> 1:23:51.680]  wants to implant microchips into the hands of hundreds of thousands of global workers,
[1:23:51.680 --> 1:23:55.280]  thousands of people in Sweden are willingly microchipping their hands and it's part of
[1:23:55.280 --> 1:23:59.480]  the transhumanist movement that is sweeping the globe and the Swedish government is financing
[1:23:59.480 --> 1:24:00.880]  it.
[1:24:00.880 --> 1:24:07.640]  Are you ready for your chip, what is Time Magazine, what is Newsweek said, let's put that back
[1:24:07.640 --> 1:24:15.680]  up on screen for TV viewers, they've got their new digital issue out and it says you will
[1:24:15.680 --> 1:24:25.880]  take the chip whether you like it or not, you see that, you see that right there, whether
[1:24:25.880 --> 1:24:30.440]  you like it or not, let's blow that up on screen for TV viewers, whether which by the
[1:24:30.440 --> 1:24:37.760]  way is not doctoring it, it's showing you, there it is, like it or not, don't believe
[1:24:37.760 --> 1:24:43.560]  your eyes on TV when Jim Acosta pushes and shoves a woman, no, no, just say Alex Jones
[1:24:43.560 --> 1:24:50.120]  who they've now created like I'm a card in the deck of being a fraud, oh Alex Jones said
[1:24:50.120 --> 1:24:55.000]  the sky was blue, Alex Jones said families were good, Alex Jones said the sun was yellow,
[1:24:55.000 --> 1:25:00.000]  Alex Jones said you need air to live, no, no, no, you just upload yourself into this machine
[1:25:00.000 --> 1:25:04.880]  and it's an AI that's been watching you for 20 years so it can copy your voice, everything
[1:25:04.880 --> 1:25:10.640]  you do but it's not really you but you'll pay to be uploaded into it and your family
[1:25:10.640 --> 1:25:15.960]  will believe it's you and will follow decisions you make as if you're living on but really
[1:25:15.960 --> 1:25:22.320]  it's the AI that's stolen your identity to a level never before seen and how are they
[1:25:22.320 --> 1:25:27.440]  going to get you to take the microchips, well you want to work in high security areas, you
[1:25:27.440 --> 1:25:30.960]  want to work in special ops, you want to work in this bank, you want to do this or that,
[1:25:30.960 --> 1:25:37.440]  we're going to give you a bonus if you do it, to prime the pump, to access your cell
[1:25:37.440 --> 1:25:42.880]  phone, oh now you got a thumb print, now there's no more codes allowed, now you got a with
[1:25:42.880 --> 1:25:46.760]  the thumb print, you got to have a face scan, no that doesn't work, now you got to have
[1:25:46.760 --> 1:25:52.520]  a chip and you'll be so obituated to your phone, so obituated that sorry the new TVs
[1:25:52.520 --> 1:25:58.560]  that came out don't work without it but finally you go down and you get it and now everybody's
[1:25:58.560 --> 1:26:03.200]  on it, you're part of the internet of things, you're tied into the beast system with your
[1:26:03.200 --> 1:26:09.840]  digital mark meaning you can operate in the system, the globalist trademark with your
[1:26:09.840 --> 1:26:17.200]  own bio frequency identifier that is turned into a code that is implanted and engraved
[1:26:17.200 --> 1:26:29.960]  in the chip, prophecy fulfilled, riddle me that batman, never offline, never free, never
[1:26:29.960 --> 1:26:37.600]  not being surveilled, never not being radiated, never not being tracked but to have the chip,
[1:26:37.600 --> 1:26:42.840]  have access to the false world they're building, the internet of things you must submit and
[1:26:42.840 --> 1:26:47.880]  at first it'll be easy to submit, big discounts on phones and electronics and you'll be able
[1:26:47.880 --> 1:26:54.320]  to get into secure areas and you'll be cool and laugh at the folks that are old fashioned,
[1:26:54.320 --> 1:26:59.800]  never remember Time Live for Kids about 15, 16 years ago had an article written like satire
[1:26:59.800 --> 1:27:04.920]  for seventh graders and it said, you belong to the future, smart and savvy and cool and
[1:27:04.920 --> 1:27:10.880]  like tech, not like your parents and grandparents that are backward and stupid and people didn't
[1:27:10.880 --> 1:27:14.280]  believe it on air when I read the actual magazine that a parent sent me and people went and
[1:27:14.280 --> 1:27:20.400]  looked online and said, no it's true, Time Magazine for Kids, Time Warner told your kids
[1:27:20.400 --> 1:27:27.960]  your parents are stupid but you'll get a chip someday and that's in your kids mind, your
[1:27:27.960 --> 1:27:40.920]  seventh grader 15 years ago, now what are they, 28, 27, they're 27 years old and don't
[1:27:40.920 --> 1:27:45.320]  know why it seems kind of cool when they think about a chip, of course if I was reading your
[1:27:45.320 --> 1:27:49.040]  parents are dumb and belong to a bygone age, you're going to get the chip, I'd be like
[1:27:49.040 --> 1:27:54.640]  my God, this is authoritarian but see not the generation Z and the millennials, not
[1:27:54.640 --> 1:27:59.040]  all of them, they've been programmed and it's like all part of the group and it's the latest
[1:27:59.040 --> 1:28:06.160]  thing and they're going to get it, like it or not and then you read who's behind it,
[1:28:06.160 --> 1:28:14.320]  oh the big banks, just like prophecy again, the big merchants of the earth, the bankers,
[1:28:14.320 --> 1:28:19.680]  the money changers of the earth, the Christ beat with a whip, they're behind it and who's
[1:28:19.680 --> 1:28:23.880]  behind getting rid of the nation state and taking all your rights, under the EU you have
[1:28:23.880 --> 1:28:27.920]  no rights, under the UN you have no rights, under any of these systems you have no rights,
[1:28:27.920 --> 1:28:34.360]  under Article 30 and 29 of the UN Universal Declaration of Human Rights, let's see they're
[1:28:34.360 --> 1:28:38.480]  telling you, oh be liberal, be loving like the apple heads, you don't pay any taxes and
[1:28:38.480 --> 1:28:44.200]  run slave factories but they're gay, so it's okay, they're not having kids, they've taken
[1:28:44.200 --> 1:28:51.000]  the first step into a wider world, the post human world, we'll be back with Jim Hoff straight
[1:28:51.000 --> 1:28:57.320]  ahead.

[1:33:20.320 --> 1:33:30.280]  listening to the Alex Jones show. So Roger Stone was toasting with me on election night
[1:33:30.280 --> 1:33:39.920]  and he said, look, notice Broward County is keeping it. The so called announcement closed.
[1:33:39.920 --> 1:33:45.760]  And he said, every time every election going back for decades, the same woman Brenda Snipes
[1:33:45.760 --> 1:33:50.760]  holds things open and then magically finds the ballots in close races to hand the state
[1:33:50.760 --> 1:33:56.600]  to Democrats. And it's a total nest. Debbie Wasserman Schultz, you know, the sheriff, all
[1:33:56.600 --> 1:34:01.800]  of it is just a sickening nest. And I think gateway pundit.com and Jim Hoff, its owner
[1:34:01.800 --> 1:34:07.120]  and publisher, but also most prolific writer has been on top of this, the best of anybody
[1:34:07.120 --> 1:34:10.880]  out there other than like grudge report.com. So I wanted to try to get him on just for
[1:34:10.880 --> 1:34:16.960]  10 minutes to go over the dizzying amounts of new stuff breaking. And it's just insane.
[1:34:16.960 --> 1:34:22.680]  Jim, thanks for coming on. Good to be with you, Alex. Where should we start? I mean,
[1:34:22.680 --> 1:34:27.600]  what on earth is going on there? Yeah, this is insane, isn't it? I don't know about you,
[1:34:27.600 --> 1:34:32.440]  but I know the my readers and the people up here in Missouri were outraged at what the
[1:34:32.440 --> 1:34:36.600]  hell's going on in Florida. Can't believe that they're allowing this to happen. And
[1:34:36.600 --> 1:34:41.960]  I'm wondering where the hell is the GOP? And where are these, you know, these lawyers
[1:34:41.960 --> 1:34:48.840]  we hear about? And as Brenda Snipes continues to add new ballots to the count every, every
[1:34:48.840 --> 1:34:54.880]  hour it seems. Today we have a couple of big stories. One is on Drudge. And that is that
[1:34:54.880 --> 1:35:01.960]  there's a video now from one of the precincts in Broward County on election night, I believe
[1:35:01.960 --> 1:35:06.920]  any or it might, I'm not exactly sure when it was. Let me just be clear. Anyway, you
[1:35:06.920 --> 1:35:16.200]  can see these ladies stuffing these ballots into these canvas, you know, like gym bags.
[1:35:16.200 --> 1:35:23.600]  And and then they noticed that someone is filming them. And I suspect the person who's
[1:35:23.600 --> 1:35:29.040]  filming, of course, is being kept behind some sort of a barrier. They noticed this guy's
[1:35:29.040 --> 1:35:38.560]  filming him. So then they they start moving these these other piles of it's hard to see
[1:35:38.560 --> 1:35:43.000]  what they are. But they start moving them in front so they build a wall so you can't
[1:35:43.000 --> 1:35:48.200]  see what the hell's going on. It's it's really unbelievable. I mean, it's like it's like
[1:35:48.200 --> 1:35:51.800]  walking and you find your child with their hand in the cookie jar. And almost all the
[1:35:51.800 --> 1:35:55.240]  cookies are gone. There's cookies down their face. And then they run around the corner
[1:35:55.240 --> 1:35:59.360]  and hide. This is the most guilty behavior. And then they're finding all these trucks
[1:35:59.360 --> 1:36:03.800]  pulling up after the losses, they can't even bring new ballots and the police wave them
[1:36:03.800 --> 1:36:07.120]  in and they say, we don't care. And the governor orders them pounded. And these they say go
[1:36:07.120 --> 1:36:12.480]  to hell. I mean, this is like incredible. It's it's stunning. And then last night there
[1:36:12.480 --> 1:36:19.800]  was a report that we put up where a ballot box that said provisional ballots was left
[1:36:19.800 --> 1:36:28.520]  in an avus rental car. And an airport worker in Lauderdale found found the the ballot box
[1:36:28.520 --> 1:36:36.840]  plus some election signs. And so far, we know that they called the Broward County elections
[1:36:36.840 --> 1:36:42.280]  people and they they had they didn't care about it. So they called the Ford Florida
[1:36:42.280 --> 1:36:49.160]  law enforcement and they're still holding this box of that says on the outside provisional
[1:36:49.160 --> 1:36:53.920]  ballots. This was left in an avus car. So there's a lot of questions that come up with
[1:36:53.920 --> 1:37:00.200]  that. Since when do election workers get rented cars? That's that's a serious question. People
[1:37:00.200 --> 1:37:09.240]  should be asking, why are we paying for election workers to have rented cars? Why? And what
[1:37:09.240 --> 1:37:15.360]  what's in this box? Why are they not concerned about this? And it's again, it kind of matches
[1:37:15.360 --> 1:37:20.160]  with what we saw from those truck videos, where people are willy nilly moving out boxes
[1:37:20.160 --> 1:37:25.400]  of that that look like ballots around inside and outside of these and then the very trucks
[1:37:25.400 --> 1:37:29.480]  a couple days after the polls closed, these trucks are all out there. People videotape
[1:37:29.480 --> 1:37:34.160]  them with with trucks pulling up the night loading them. And then the very same trucks
[1:37:34.160 --> 1:37:38.880]  from multiple videos show up the next day and drive in. And then they're all grabbed
[1:37:38.880 --> 1:37:43.160]  and taken off to some secret place violating state law. This is like watching guys come
[1:37:43.160 --> 1:37:47.040]  out of a bank with with stockings over their faces with bags of money. We just let them
[1:37:47.040 --> 1:37:54.000]  drive away. Absolutely. Who's gonna stop this, Alex? I mean, it's infuriating. If they allow
[1:37:54.000 --> 1:37:58.800]  this to continue, if people don't go to jail, you know, and I know that this is gonna continue
[1:37:58.800 --> 1:38:04.560]  from now on. And Republicans were not they they, you know, they failed again. They were
[1:38:04.560 --> 1:38:08.360]  not ready for this. They should have seen this coming. It happens in every election.
[1:38:08.360 --> 1:38:13.400]  And Alex here in St. Louis, where I live, the same sorts of things happen in all these
[1:38:13.400 --> 1:38:19.960]  big cities. Why aren't Republicans more responsible and, you know, plan ahead? It just it's very
[1:38:19.960 --> 1:38:25.440]  troublesome. I see Matt Gates there. He was one hero this weekend who went down the representative
[1:38:25.440 --> 1:38:31.200]  from Florida went down and was asking questions and actually was turned away when he saw one
[1:38:31.200 --> 1:38:35.560]  of these trucks pull up with the ballot boxes in it.
[1:38:35.560 --> 1:38:39.960]  Well, the public's doing a great job. They're videotaping the very trucks and parking lots.
[1:38:39.960 --> 1:38:44.320]  People suspiciously pulling up, throwing it in the back, and then people go to the polling
[1:38:44.320 --> 1:38:49.920]  place or the central tabulation area and see the very trucks pull up. So we're getting
[1:38:49.920 --> 1:38:54.880]  some good, you know, evidence of this entire chain, but you're right. The governor ordered
[1:38:54.880 --> 1:39:00.320]  this stuff and pounded on Friday. And there's been nothing's happened. They're not impounded.
[1:39:00.320 --> 1:39:05.760]  The Democrats are just behind closed doors with quote, a bunch of Hillary Clinton move
[1:39:05.760 --> 1:39:11.120]  on dot org groups who are now coming in as the volunteers, Jim.
[1:39:11.120 --> 1:39:15.960]  Yeah. And we have another story we're working on right now that's good. We're going to break
[1:39:15.960 --> 1:39:21.520]  this afternoon, but it has to do with the jails down there and how they've been going inside
[1:39:21.520 --> 1:39:26.440]  and signing these people up and getting some ballots out of these jails. We already heard
[1:39:26.440 --> 1:39:33.080]  that that one killer, Nicholas Cruz was able to sign up to vote while he after he murdered
[1:39:33.080 --> 1:39:37.680]  that, you know, dozen kids. And, but there's more to this story and we're going to talk
[1:39:37.680 --> 1:39:43.440]  about it this afternoon. Also, I saw the gateway punnet.com. I saw them red report.com. We
[1:39:43.440 --> 1:39:48.600]  covered it too at news wars.com. But this is election officials admitting and saying,
[1:39:48.600 --> 1:39:52.720]  yeah, we let illegals vote, not just project Veritas video. They're letting the illegals
[1:39:52.720 --> 1:39:58.680]  vote. It what you said is key at the start. They're setting the precedent. This woman
[1:39:58.680 --> 1:40:02.760]  in Broward County has been caught. She's been found guilty. Why is she still there?
[1:40:02.760 --> 1:40:06.160]  And of course, the stealing's gotten more naked and more brazen because she's not getting
[1:40:06.160 --> 1:40:11.160]  in trouble. Right. Right. That woman should be put in jail. She wasn't turning over the
[1:40:11.160 --> 1:40:15.880]  counts like she was supposed to every 45 minutes. She never let them know how many more ballots
[1:40:15.880 --> 1:40:22.040]  she had left to count. It's just so corrupt. I can't believe that this woman is not in jail.
[1:40:22.040 --> 1:40:28.520]  Then the Miami Herald reported over the weekend that they caught her counting provisional
[1:40:28.520 --> 1:40:32.760]  ballots that had been punched out for Democrats, but they called it the incompetence. Oh, this
[1:40:32.760 --> 1:40:37.480]  adds that she's incompetent. No, it's not incompetent when they're filled out for Democrats
[1:40:37.480 --> 1:40:41.000]  and they actually catch her cramming them in her. And then they ask her, she goes, I don't
[1:40:41.000 --> 1:40:47.600]  know what we're going to do. It's too late. Unbelievable. Yeah, just unbelievable. It's
[1:40:47.600 --> 1:40:51.520]  very sad to see this. I hope they get this under control. I hope they can pull out these
[1:40:51.520 --> 1:40:56.040]  seats. I still have my doubts that Republicans will win now. You can't get, you can't let
[1:40:56.040 --> 1:41:02.200]  allow Democrats to have two days to manufacture votes and expect to win your race. Well, you
[1:41:02.200 --> 1:41:06.840]  you set it up front. The Republicans being incompetent, greenlighting this, letting
[1:41:06.840 --> 1:41:11.480]  them censor the Internet, letting Big Tech do this. It's signaled weakness in the face
[1:41:11.480 --> 1:41:17.840]  of the Democrats on the warpath. And so in the future, it won't just be Arizona and California
[1:41:17.840 --> 1:41:21.760]  and Florida where everybody gets cheated. They're going to do it everywhere now. Why
[1:41:21.760 --> 1:41:26.560]  not? Right. Right. And we saw that in Georgia this weekend on Saturday night, the Georgia
[1:41:26.560 --> 1:41:31.800]  Democrat Party tweets out, Hey, we have several precincts, precincts and counties that have
[1:41:31.800 --> 1:41:37.360]  discovered thousands of new ballots. This was on Saturday night. They tweeted this out.
[1:41:37.360 --> 1:41:42.280]  So they, that these are, these are not decent people were, as you know, more than anyone.
[1:41:42.280 --> 1:41:45.880]  These, these are not good people were dealing with. These are criminals and they need to
[1:41:45.880 --> 1:41:50.560]  be stopped. In closing, I just want to get your take on this. Trump coming out and saying,
[1:41:50.560 --> 1:41:54.160]  no, they didn't doctor the video. They blew it up. They're still on the news everywhere
[1:41:54.160 --> 1:41:59.200]  saying we doctor the video when anybody can see it's the same video. Right. I think this
[1:41:59.200 --> 1:42:04.200]  puts a nail in the coffin of the mainstream media. Anybody who watches that can see that
[1:42:04.200 --> 1:42:10.400]  nothing was doctored. The media, it's, it's unbelievable that they would continue with
[1:42:10.400 --> 1:42:17.000]  this, this mean they have. And good for Paul Joseph Watson and info wars and you for,
[1:42:17.000 --> 1:42:22.400]  you know, doing the zoom in. Trump was absolutely right. I love that he defended you guys. And
[1:42:22.400 --> 1:42:27.120]  so the people, people will know who to trust. It may take some time, but they're going to
[1:42:27.120 --> 1:42:31.280]  know who they can trust and who they can't. All right, Jim, again, we put it in.com. Thanks
[1:42:31.280 --> 1:42:34.280]  for coming on. Thanks for all the great work you're doing over there. You're still on Twitter
[1:42:34.280 --> 1:42:39.400]  for now at Gateway Pundit. Thank you. Thanks. Thanks, Alex. All right, folks. I got all
[1:42:39.400 --> 1:42:44.600]  this other international news to get to. I've got the fire news or a bunch of out of control
[1:42:44.600 --> 1:42:48.680]  video. The death tolls now broken the record in California. It's all coming up and the
[1:42:48.680 --> 1:42:54.200]  67% off super sale on colloidal silver. We've never gone that low at infowarstore.com.
[1:42:54.200 --> 1:43:05.600]  We need to go back and revisit the foundations of our freedom. Our freedoms don't consist
[1:43:05.600 --> 1:43:08.640]  of the things that are enumerated on a piece of paper. It consists of the things that we're
[1:43:08.640 --> 1:43:12.560]  willing to fight for. The First Amendment, the Bill of Rights, the rest of the Bill of
[1:43:12.560 --> 1:43:18.800]  Rights are prohibitions. They're prohibitions against powerful organizations and individuals
[1:43:18.800 --> 1:43:23.600]  taking those God given rights from us as individuals. You better understand that because they're
[1:43:23.600 --> 1:43:31.440]  taking them right now. We have seen what they want to do. They called it UN Agenda 21. Now
[1:43:31.440 --> 1:43:36.760]  they call it the UN 2030 Agenda. They want everybody off of the rural lands. They want
[1:43:36.760 --> 1:43:41.880]  people out of the suburbs. They want to pack everybody into the cities because that's where
[1:43:41.880 --> 1:43:47.840]  it is easiest for them to control everyone. It's The David Knight Show. I never missed
[1:43:47.840 --> 1:43:57.360]  your show. Any day. I mean, I mean, never. At infowarstore.com forward slash show. Living
[1:43:57.360 --> 1:44:02.760]  in volcano may sound more dramatic than it really is. The real drama can be found here
[1:44:02.760 --> 1:44:07.640]  in Leilani Estates, but a lot of us on the big island rely on rainwater and we need to
[1:44:07.640 --> 1:44:14.560]  be concerned about ash and acid rain. Volcanic ash may contain heavy metal particles and acid
[1:44:14.560 --> 1:44:20.000]  rain could lower the pH of the water to unhealthy levels. To find out, we employed a series of
[1:44:20.000 --> 1:44:26.240]  tests for heavy metals, alkalinity and pH. What we learned was that there was in fact
[1:44:26.240 --> 1:44:31.600]  unhealthy levels of heavy metals and acidity in the rainwater. Next, we tested the water
[1:44:31.600 --> 1:44:36.680]  from our Alexa pure gravity filter and not only were the heavy metal levels within safe
[1:44:36.680 --> 1:44:43.360]  measure, but the pH was also restored to optimal levels. As it turns out, the filter on the
[1:44:43.360 --> 1:44:48.880]  Alexa pure raises the pH of the water. So what we've learned is that volcanic ash and
[1:44:48.880 --> 1:44:54.800]  acid rain can contaminate a rainwater supply. But more importantly, a good water filtration
[1:44:54.800 --> 1:45:01.440]  system will purify it. The globalists know that if they suppress the good halogen and
[1:45:01.440 --> 1:45:06.120]  pump the environment full of the bad halogens, fluoride, chlorine, bromide, you name it,
[1:45:06.120 --> 1:45:11.680]  that it lowers IQ. It literally dumbs the population down. And on our quest to bring
[1:45:11.680 --> 1:45:17.280]  our listeners and viewers, the best iodine in the world, we've gone through two permutations.
[1:45:17.280 --> 1:45:21.400]  First seaweed-based iodine that was pretty good, but hard to source, and the globalists
[1:45:21.400 --> 1:45:26.040]  tried to block us getting a supply of it. So we discovered deep earth crystals of pure
[1:45:26.040 --> 1:45:30.800]  nascent iodine and brought you X2. That's been incredible. Now, due to the establishment
[1:45:30.800 --> 1:45:35.760]  trying to block that, we did more research and secured more of the deep earth crystals
[1:45:35.760 --> 1:45:40.440]  of nascent iodine. But chemists, scientists, and others showed us the research that by
[1:45:40.440 --> 1:45:46.520]  combining it with three other compounds, two forms of iodine and vitamin C, it supercharges
[1:45:46.520 --> 1:45:52.480]  it and makes it even more bioavailable. Ladies and gentlemen, you want to research it, you
[1:45:52.480 --> 1:45:58.400]  want to see it. It's an incredible discovery. X3, now available at m4slife.com.
[1:45:58.400 --> 1:46:02.160]  Our grandparents, the great grandparents, knew that they can't food during the fall,
[1:46:02.160 --> 1:46:07.400]  so they'd have it during the winter. And that's what I'm talking about at m4store.com. With

[1:47:22.800 --> 1:47:27.120]  The last few decades, the globalists, the social engineers, were setting up their system
[1:47:27.120 --> 1:47:33.040]  preparing it. Preparing to bring down the West, preparing to bring down any future
[1:47:33.040 --> 1:47:39.320]  competition that could challenge their hegemonic world government rule. Trying to bring down
[1:47:39.320 --> 1:47:47.200]  the idea of the West, the Christian ethos, all of it that could block this system. And
[1:47:47.200 --> 1:47:53.000]  now, they're out in the open. World governments here, the EU as an empire, ready for war with
[1:47:53.000 --> 1:48:00.600]  the US, allied with Islam. Being a nationalist and caring about your country is evil. It's
[1:48:00.600 --> 1:48:07.120]  all concerted. And everybody in England needs to get microchips, and the government's preparing
[1:48:07.120 --> 1:48:17.600]  that if you work at a bank, you've got to get one. It's all being announced right now.
[1:48:17.600 --> 1:48:22.160]  From free market, American nationalism comes everything we enjoy, everything that everyone
[1:48:22.160 --> 1:48:32.280]  wants to get here to have. With globalism comes absolute tyranny. But imagine, they
[1:48:32.280 --> 1:48:37.880]  can get you to say, oh, my nation shouldn't have any authority. Where you pay taxes,
[1:48:37.880 --> 1:48:41.680]  where you live, now they transfer your money out to an international government where you
[1:48:41.680 --> 1:48:49.640]  have no rights. Only special NGOs created by the globalist tab of voice. They're the
[1:48:49.640 --> 1:48:55.400]  astroturf. So we're now at that point. And when I say I'm going to change course, I've
[1:48:55.400 --> 1:49:01.200]  been just pure backing Trump, pure backing the reinsurgence of nationalism to get these
[1:49:01.200 --> 1:49:05.240]  beachheads going. And that's good. That's important. But everybody on the street, everybody
[1:49:05.240 --> 1:49:10.600]  that works here, my family says, man, you used to make documentaries. You used to go
[1:49:10.600 --> 1:49:16.760]  in depth on particular topics. And so the Democrats always attacked you because you
[1:49:16.760 --> 1:49:21.240]  were pro-life and pro-gun. But other than that, we were able to get the info out to
[1:49:21.240 --> 1:49:27.520]  anybody because it didn't have that political flavor to it. But see, we had to come out
[1:49:27.520 --> 1:49:33.400]  and say nationalism's okay to say that we have a right to exist as we have an identity
[1:49:33.400 --> 1:49:38.520]  other than globalism. Globalism takes all your identities and then gives you their false
[1:49:38.520 --> 1:49:42.680]  identity. So the nation-state's not perfect either. It's got its problems. And there are
[1:49:42.680 --> 1:49:49.000]  different flavors around the world. They try to confuse the public that to say the country
[1:49:49.000 --> 1:49:56.520]  exists to say, I believe in America and our system, that that's somehow evil or racist.
[1:49:56.520 --> 1:50:03.600]  So it means the big megacorporations that have set up deals with China, where they have
[1:50:03.600 --> 1:50:08.720]  giant tariffs on us and we don't have tariffs on them, it means if we don't bend over and
[1:50:08.720 --> 1:50:17.240]  let multinational corporations loot the living hell out of us, that we're bad. And see, first
[1:50:17.240 --> 1:50:20.120]  it's don't be a white supremacist and then don't be this and then don't be that and soon
[1:50:20.120 --> 1:50:24.360]  it's don't be a mother, don't be a father, don't be a Christian, don't be a nationalist.
[1:50:24.360 --> 1:50:29.640]  And everyone just rolls over in virtue signals. Mark Dice sent a tweet out saying, look at
[1:50:29.640 --> 1:50:35.960]  the cultural appropriation. They have a white kid and a black panther Halloween costume.
[1:50:35.960 --> 1:50:42.040]  Take it down and they apologized and did because the corporations want to train you
[1:50:42.040 --> 1:50:46.960]  through social engineering, through Pavlovian conditioning, through peer pressure to do
[1:50:46.960 --> 1:50:53.200]  outrageous crazy things in the name of being padded on the head by the system. But you
[1:50:53.200 --> 1:51:00.560]  get nothing out of that, but slavery and poverty. The people still sell out to it, especially
[1:51:00.560 --> 1:51:06.640]  folks that go get the worthless college degrees. There are big estimates out there. I've been
[1:51:06.640 --> 1:51:12.320]  talking about this for 20 plus years. Limbaugh's been talking about it for 30 plus years. How
[1:51:12.320 --> 1:51:18.600]  college degrees for 90% of the degrees are beyond worthless. You've got to pay for them
[1:51:18.600 --> 1:51:24.920]  and you end up never getting your money back. So they're beyond worthless. They're negative.
[1:51:24.920 --> 1:51:30.440]  It's like saying, what's the value of kidney cancer? Maybe they cut the kidney out, you
[1:51:30.440 --> 1:51:35.040]  survived, but was there a value to having it? No, it has a negative value on your health
[1:51:35.040 --> 1:51:45.280]  and monetarily. Having the kidney removed wasn't a plus. So globalism's like cancer.
[1:51:45.280 --> 1:51:51.520]  It's like cancer. But you see, they know you're going to get inducted into this thing and
[1:51:51.520 --> 1:51:54.680]  then it's going to be worthless. So they go, oh, get a second degree, get a third degree.
[1:51:54.680 --> 1:51:59.920]  And by then you just get a politically brainwashed degree. So you can be a Politico or an operative,
[1:51:59.920 --> 1:52:04.800]  give your corrupt. That's the only job you're going to be able to get paid on. And now your
[1:52:04.800 --> 1:52:08.880]  whole identity and the hundreds of thousands of dollars of debt you've got, you're 35 years
[1:52:08.880 --> 1:52:16.000]  old. You've got three degrees and only by submitting to the priest class, whatever the new brainwashing
[1:52:16.000 --> 1:52:22.320]  is, whatever the new directive is, do you exist? And now they say it's not enough to get your
[1:52:22.320 --> 1:52:26.600]  money as a college professor. You've got to go out and put on a black uniform and beat
[1:52:26.600 --> 1:52:30.400]  people up. And you've got to go out and harass people online and you've got to shut down
[1:52:30.400 --> 1:52:35.440]  free speech all over America, just like you did on the university. Now get out there and
[1:52:35.440 --> 1:52:46.200]  get the job done. Sir, yes, sir. This is an army. This is a program. These people are
[1:52:46.200 --> 1:52:55.640]  coming for us. They're here. And why do we put up with it? Why do we bend over to it?
[1:52:55.640 --> 1:53:00.120]  The cashless society's here. It's going to be used to totally oppress everybody. A lot
[1:53:00.120 --> 1:53:05.280]  of folks go, well, then I better keep my mouth shut. Exactly. They're betting that you're
[1:53:05.280 --> 1:53:10.960]  cowards. And if you make the wrong decision now, oh, don't follow Alex Jones on Twitter,
[1:53:10.960 --> 1:53:15.560]  not that you can anymore, or you won't be able to get entrance into college, even though
[1:53:15.560 --> 1:53:20.520]  you have a 3.9, why would you want to go to an institution that's anti free speech and
[1:53:20.520 --> 1:53:27.360]  authoritarian? You know, you're going to get ripped off. It's worthless. Go to a university
[1:53:27.360 --> 1:53:31.040]  that doesn't act like that. And then soon those will be the preeminent universities.
[1:53:31.040 --> 1:53:40.720]  They're teaching something real. Everything has become a con job on purpose.
[1:53:40.720 --> 1:53:45.680]  The globalists are betting against humanity. We have to bet on humanity. It's the only
[1:53:45.680 --> 1:53:51.720]  future we have. It's the only chance we have. But the universities and the high schools
[1:53:51.720 --> 1:54:00.920]  and the TV and the culture is creating nasty, horrible little narcissistic demons that just
[1:54:00.920 --> 1:54:06.800]  kind of MPC and bought around and all the studies show way more likely to steal, way
[1:54:06.800 --> 1:54:12.760]  more likely to tell you you should virtue signal, but not do anything themselves.
[1:54:12.760 --> 1:54:21.600]  We have created a bunch of twisted week politicos who have been promised the world, but first
[1:54:21.600 --> 1:54:27.640]  they've got to conquer you. And are you going to let these people do this? That's why what
[1:54:27.640 --> 1:54:32.920]  Trump is doing is so great. He's trying to unify us, trying to get America a better deal,
[1:54:32.920 --> 1:54:38.120]  trying to show people that Americana works a lot better than collectivism and the nightmare
[1:54:38.120 --> 1:54:44.000]  of Apple that literally has the lowest paid employees in the world and suicide nets and
[1:54:44.000 --> 1:54:49.000]  just total and helps report on the on Buddhist and Christians to have them murdered and so
[1:54:49.000 --> 1:54:55.680]  does Google and Sundar, the head of Google comes out and tells Congress, you should want
[1:54:55.680 --> 1:55:02.760]  us to censor. These are very helpful things we can do for you. They said to Sundar, this
[1:55:02.760 --> 1:55:07.400]  is very evil what you're doing, helping impress the Chinese. He said, no, it's great. These
[1:55:07.400 --> 1:55:12.360]  are great services. That's how it just committed to the evil. These guys aren't even hiding
[1:55:12.360 --> 1:55:15.400]  anymore. They're just like, no, we're taking over and there's nothing you can do now.
[1:55:15.400 --> 1:55:26.000]  Just like the cover of Time Magazine. Put it back up there. It says you will be assimilated.
[1:55:26.000 --> 1:55:32.080]  Implantable tech is here and you will accept it. Yeah, those are articles from a month
[1:55:32.080 --> 1:55:39.640]  ago. So now Sundar just openly says it's all accelerated. Oh, no, it was a letter to the
[1:55:39.640 --> 1:55:46.560]  Senate. He said, no, these are great things. Censorship is good. It's good. At first, they
[1:55:46.560 --> 1:55:51.760]  weren't doing it. Now they're doing it, but it's for your own good. Another key point
[1:55:51.760 --> 1:55:58.080]  here, ladies and gentlemen, that I need to make is that I didn't always do it at the
[1:55:58.080 --> 1:56:03.080]  end of the hour. I didn't do it like in 30 seconds a minute. And it really doesn't do
[1:56:03.080 --> 1:56:08.640]  this show, this operation justice or doesn't do you justice. We have the Alexa pure water
[1:56:08.640 --> 1:56:16.960]  filtration system that leading competitors cost $300. It's normally 200. And right now
[1:56:16.960 --> 1:56:22.920]  it's $127. You cannot get a better stainless steel gravity fed filter that cuts out all
[1:56:22.920 --> 1:56:27.720]  the garbage that leaves the good minerals in for anything near this. The leading competitors
[1:56:27.720 --> 1:56:31.560]  are crap. I can tell you that I'm not going to say anything else, but that's why we don't
[1:56:31.560 --> 1:56:40.040]  carry them. Alexa pure is amazing. Highest ratings, highest customer evaluations. It's
[1:56:40.040 --> 1:56:44.880]  what I use at my home. I cook with a versus most of this and then I use this for drinking
[1:56:44.880 --> 1:56:48.440]  water and I have bottled water. The point is, is that I love it. I use it when I go
[1:56:48.440 --> 1:56:54.440]  on the road info or store.com Alexa pure pro. That's their big one, the nice one. They're
[1:56:54.440 --> 1:56:58.960]  all nice, but it's, it's, it's, you know, the big one. Again, leading competitors,
[1:56:58.960 --> 1:57:07.120]  350, they are just, you know, 200% markups, 250% markups. No, this thing on regular sale
[1:57:07.120 --> 1:57:13.680]  has 100% markup. Okay. No, not even that. There's like a 90% markup right now. It's
[1:57:13.680 --> 1:57:20.080]  49% off. Ladies and gentlemen, I mean, if everyone just committed to go, you know, I'm
[1:57:20.080 --> 1:57:23.400]  going to filter my water. There's a lot of crap in there for my kids. If everybody listening
[1:57:23.400 --> 1:57:30.000]  just got one, that would fund us. You'd have cleaner water, a 360 wind. You cannot beat
[1:57:30.000 --> 1:57:37.600]  the deal. Normally 249 now 127. Look at the 91% ratings, 4.7 stars info or store.com.

[2:00:11.800 --> 2:00:17.760]  All right, I'm going to give the number out in the next segment and I'm going to go to
[2:00:17.760 --> 2:00:22.640]  your phone calls and I'm going to obviously get to all the other news as well. But I came
[2:00:22.640 --> 2:00:27.720]  across this article from the day I was banned off the internet, off these globalist platforms.
[2:00:27.720 --> 2:00:34.520]  And of course, the purge has now been all across the spectrum. And he left his groups
[2:00:34.520 --> 2:00:37.920]  and not controlled by the globalists. They're being shut down now too. Alex Jones and Donald
[2:00:37.920 --> 2:00:42.880]  Trump, you need to blow the whistle on Chinese Communist Infiltration of Silicon Valley and
[2:00:42.880 --> 2:00:46.800]  the Democratic Party. And he did do that three days later because he's already been told
[2:00:46.800 --> 2:00:50.880]  that by the Pentagon and his own research. But I thought since this is one of the reasons
[2:00:50.880 --> 2:00:55.440]  we got banned was me hammering this. This was the last straw that we'd go ahead and play
[2:00:55.440 --> 2:01:01.480]  this most banned of the most banned. Here it is. You know about it when I'm getting banned
[2:01:01.480 --> 2:01:07.600]  or shadow banned because I'll make a big deal about it. Matt Gaetz was shadow banned and
[2:01:07.600 --> 2:01:14.000]  we told him two weeks before Roger Stone told him on the phone and in text messages, we've
[2:01:14.000 --> 2:01:18.600]  run you through their system. We have sites that look at this, we're sending links. You're
[2:01:18.600 --> 2:01:24.400]  already 90% banned on Twitter. Gaetz went up during the committee hearing and said, you're
[2:01:24.400 --> 2:01:28.160]  a private company, you can do whatever you want, not even kidding it. So the next day,
[2:01:28.160 --> 2:01:34.560]  they shadow banned him 99%. They go, this guy's an idiot. We all just lied to him and said,
[2:01:34.560 --> 2:01:38.600]  we don't censor any conservatives. He said, that's fine. Just don't talk about killing
[2:01:38.600 --> 2:01:43.720]  congressman. And the next day, they banned him down to nothing. Then he said he felt
[2:01:43.720 --> 2:01:49.040]  victimized and I'm not trying to put Matt Gaetz down. Just come on, man. Get it together.
[2:01:49.040 --> 2:01:53.080]  Figure out what's going on. Mainstream corporate media is fake news. They're the enemy of the
[2:01:53.080 --> 2:01:58.640]  American people, like the president said. And now they're coming after everybody. Now,
[2:01:58.640 --> 2:02:03.760]  if you want to get into the real reason all this is happening, I know it's demoralizing.
[2:02:03.760 --> 2:02:07.720]  I don't want to demoralize people, but facts are facts like having cancer. It's operable.
[2:02:07.720 --> 2:02:11.800]  We can fix it. Mr. President, you know, the office of personal management was done by
[2:02:11.800 --> 2:02:15.120]  insiders. That's even come out in intelligence reports. They try to keep it quiet because
[2:02:15.120 --> 2:02:18.640]  it's such trees and it's unbelievable. We know China owns the majority of our debt after
[2:02:18.640 --> 2:02:23.040]  the private fellow reserve. We know they now own Hollywood. You've helped block some of
[2:02:23.040 --> 2:02:27.640]  them buying up American ban stand a few final things they didn't know. We know that they're
[2:02:27.640 --> 2:02:34.320]  teaching Maoism in the colleges and all 50 major state-funded colleges have major chai
[2:02:34.320 --> 2:02:38.720]  comm infiltration. Some of them are run by the chai comms, even the Washington Post had
[2:02:38.720 --> 2:02:45.320]  to admit. We know that the people's army of China has been caught running Diane Feinstein's
[2:02:45.320 --> 2:02:48.960]  operation. We know their penetration is hundreds of times that of the Russians. We know they're
[2:02:48.960 --> 2:02:52.640]  involved in election meddling and we're so arrogant they went to Davos a year and a half
[2:02:52.640 --> 2:02:58.760]  ago and said they would stop your agenda along with Yunker. Mr. President, America knows
[2:02:58.760 --> 2:03:03.480]  you're real. They know the Democrats are the anti-American globalist ally of the chai comms,
[2:03:03.480 --> 2:03:07.760]  radical Islam, the unelected EU and others. If you come out before the midterms and make
[2:03:07.760 --> 2:03:12.480]  the censorship the big issue with them trying to steal the election and if you make the
[2:03:12.480 --> 2:03:16.160]  fact we need the Internet Bill of Rights and antitrust busting on these companies, if
[2:03:16.160 --> 2:03:21.960]  they don't back off right now and if you don't come out and point out that the communist
[2:03:21.960 --> 2:03:25.800]  Chinese have penetrated and infiltrated and are way, way worse than the Russians because
[2:03:25.800 --> 2:03:29.840]  it's true and the Democrats are scared of that coming out and you've got the Feinstein
[2:03:29.840 --> 2:03:35.080]  info coming out and more is about to come out, just as I've told everybody, than they
[2:03:35.080 --> 2:03:41.480]  will be able to steal the midterms and start the impeachment. It's the right thing to do,
[2:03:41.480 --> 2:03:46.960]  Mr. President. It's the truth and it's crazy to believe it. It's crazy to understand it.
[2:03:46.960 --> 2:03:54.320]  I know you've been told this from our technology to the South China Sea to everything to them
[2:03:54.320 --> 2:03:59.320]  having 98% of rare earth minerals. They didn't do that by themselves. They were given that.
[2:03:59.320 --> 2:04:03.040]  David Rockefeller said he was going to move everything to China. They said they were going
[2:04:03.040 --> 2:04:07.240]  to do all this and now you stepped in the country's coming back from the dead. They're
[2:04:07.240 --> 2:04:11.360]  desperate to stop it and they're trying to stop you and every American from having their
[2:04:11.360 --> 2:04:16.480]  speech by defaming me, lying about what I've done, Soros financing fake lawsuits to give
[2:04:16.480 --> 2:04:20.760]  it legitimacy and now de-platforming me ahead of it because the lawsuits are all getting
[2:04:20.760 --> 2:04:27.560]  thrown out because their lies, 90% of what's in these things are total frauds and they
[2:04:27.560 --> 2:04:31.920]  know we're getting stronger and they know we're moving forward and they now have made
[2:04:31.920 --> 2:04:36.760]  the wrong move. I believe they've jumped the shark. I believe they've won the battle but
[2:04:36.760 --> 2:04:40.960]  they're going to lose the war if you with your vision continue to take action and make
[2:04:40.960 --> 2:04:45.920]  free speech and this internet antitrust garbage the number one issue and move against them
[2:04:45.920 --> 2:04:50.320]  now. If you don't, they're going to steal the midterms. They're already doing it with
[2:04:50.320 --> 2:04:56.600]  economic contributions. The Democrats blocking everybody else's speech that supports America.

[2:06:13.080 --> 2:06:23.320]  So, the day that I was banned by so-called big tech before they started their major purge
[2:06:23.320 --> 2:06:30.400]  is everybody else. A few months ahead of the midterms on August 7th, I said to the president
[2:06:30.400 --> 2:06:34.760]  if you don't do this, they're going to steal the election. A month later he came out and
[2:06:34.760 --> 2:06:39.360]  said, look, they're buying four page ads and full page ads in major newspapers. The Chinese
[2:06:39.360 --> 2:06:47.200]  government is saying I'm bad. Vote against Republicans. That's open and shut. He brought
[2:06:47.200 --> 2:06:54.360]  it up at the U.N., right to the Chinese ambassador to the U.N. It's China that owns Hollywood.
[2:06:54.360 --> 2:06:58.760]  It's China that owns the national debt through fraud. It's China that has 98% of rare earth
[2:06:58.760 --> 2:07:04.800]  minerals. And America has been maneuvered from being the global power with 50 plus percent
[2:07:04.800 --> 2:07:10.800]  of the wealth, 4% of the population of the planet in the 1950s to now having almost nothing.
[2:07:10.800 --> 2:07:17.360]  We've been maneuvered into destruction. And I warned the president. And real clear politics
[2:07:17.360 --> 2:07:26.720]  memorialized it. And I used all that attention when Drudge was top linked to us to not talk
[2:07:26.720 --> 2:07:33.480]  about Info Wars, but to talk about our enemies, the globalist who shut up communist China
[2:07:33.480 --> 2:07:40.360]  and use it as their economic and military engine for global takeover. Allied with the
[2:07:40.360 --> 2:07:47.320]  unelected E.U., now saying it needs to be an imperial army to fight the U.S. and other
[2:07:47.320 --> 2:07:56.560]  nations and that nations are bad and that we should be E.U. patriots. Macron said when
[2:07:56.560 --> 2:08:00.960]  the E.U. was unelected, dictatorial, doesn't pay taxes, and now these countries that never
[2:08:00.960 --> 2:08:05.080]  voted to be part of it. Remember it was a trade deal like the IMF, the World Bank, the
[2:08:05.080 --> 2:08:14.920]  TPP, but became incrementally a total dictatorship England voted three years ago to get out.
[2:08:14.920 --> 2:08:25.600]  And they can't get out. They can't get out. And then Bloomberg comes out and says we need
[2:08:25.600 --> 2:08:35.040]  more technocrats in front page articles saying we need dictatorships worldwide by tech companies
[2:08:35.040 --> 2:08:41.360]  serviced and controlled by big banks. And the big tech companies are moving in and they're
[2:08:41.360 --> 2:08:47.200]  doing it. So I've warned the president and this is my emergency message to the president
[2:08:47.200 --> 2:08:52.360]  again. You must act now. And I know you give the orders. I know you gave the orders to
[2:08:52.360 --> 2:08:59.600]  Rod Rosenstein. He didn't do it. Now you've got Mr. Whitaker and the word is this is pretty
[2:08:59.600 --> 2:09:04.920]  big news is that they are preparing the big antitrust actions against big tech and others.
[2:09:04.920 --> 2:09:08.240]  That's why the Democrats announced today they're going to hold hearings as soon as they get
[2:09:08.240 --> 2:09:13.760]  in out of this lame duck Republican Congress for the next two months as soon as they get
[2:09:13.760 --> 2:09:22.440]  in. They're going to hold hearings on Trump's treatment of the media saying he's authoritarian
[2:09:22.440 --> 2:09:26.960]  when the so-called corporate media is the murderer of truth, trying to shut down all
[2:09:26.960 --> 2:09:34.960]  the free press and trying to shut down talk radio and trying to shut down our funding.
[2:09:34.960 --> 2:09:39.480]  Those Republicans in those hearings should be able to destroy the Democrats. They're
[2:09:39.480 --> 2:09:45.920]  the ones trying to get rid of free speech in America. They had Democrat committees last
[2:09:45.920 --> 2:09:51.880]  year and this year say Matt Drudge should be shut down using the federal elections
[2:09:51.880 --> 2:09:59.440]  commission that I shouldn't be on the air. They have hearings about me and I'm not called.
[2:09:59.440 --> 2:10:05.240]  That's never before been done in America. They were going to have hearings about the
[2:10:05.240 --> 2:10:12.640]  branch divisions, the ones that weren't in prison were there. Think about how fundamentally
[2:10:12.640 --> 2:10:18.520]  screwed up our system is now. For the Dallas Morning News and a whole bunch of the publications
[2:10:18.520 --> 2:10:22.840]  this week said fire Sarah Huckabee Sanders and take Alex Jones off the air. The articles
[2:10:22.840 --> 2:10:27.320]  read like satire and none of them showed the video. See at first they'd show it and say
[2:10:27.320 --> 2:10:32.440]  look how it's doctored, but it costs a thing and people want, it's not doctored. So now
[2:10:32.440 --> 2:10:38.040]  they just don't show it. Every late night comic show, every program, Alex Jones is bad.
[2:10:38.040 --> 2:10:43.080]  He's a liar taking him off the air. He did this. He's a white supremacist. These people
[2:10:43.080 --> 2:10:48.040]  are dangerous because you know why they're dangerous? They work in unison, ladies and
[2:10:48.040 --> 2:11:00.320]  gentlemen. Only motherboard, vice and red state talk to known PhD video editors. It's
[2:11:00.320 --> 2:11:05.520]  via a PhD for that. That's what they went to. They said, no, it's not edited. It's blown
[2:11:05.520 --> 2:11:09.680]  up and it's crappy on Twitter. So there's some drop frames. That's normal. And there's
[2:11:09.680 --> 2:11:14.560]  not just two drop frames when he karate chops. They claim showing it speed up. No, it doesn't.
[2:11:14.560 --> 2:11:19.200]  It's the same amount of time. It just blurs the image for a millisecond. So the handle
[2:11:19.200 --> 2:11:25.320]  a little blurry. That's what it does. It interlaces. It just mixes them together. They had to admit
[2:11:25.320 --> 2:11:32.920]  it was not doctor. They, of course they do. It was a doctor. But it doesn't matter because
[2:11:32.920 --> 2:11:37.680]  Stephen Colbert and all these other shows word for word got the exact same script and
[2:11:37.680 --> 2:11:44.040]  all said the exact same words from CNN to the late night comedy shows to the Dallas
[2:11:44.040 --> 2:11:48.440]  morning news. They all said fire. How could be Sanders? Jones sped it up, slowed it down
[2:11:48.440 --> 2:11:52.120]  and edited it and all the rest of it. You know, if I was going to edit video, can we
[2:11:52.120 --> 2:11:56.080]  pull up the thing I found on Reddit or the Dario found on Reddit? Rich, somebody edited
[2:11:56.080 --> 2:12:02.840]  a costa. It is doctored punching the intern. That's doctored. That's doctored. You're
[2:12:02.840 --> 2:12:11.040]  about to see the TV viewer is doctored. That's doctored. Look, I know the audience goes,
[2:12:11.040 --> 2:12:14.920]  this is a petty thing. Why are you covering? It's not petty. When the entire corporate
[2:12:14.920 --> 2:12:22.800]  media in unison says that Alex Jones, Paul Joseph Watson, info wars lied to you and
[2:12:22.800 --> 2:12:27.600]  then they show you the very video and it's exactly what we said and a costa says he didn't
[2:12:27.600 --> 2:12:42.200]  touch her. That's next level fraud. And so the big takeaway here is this. That's why
[2:12:42.200 --> 2:12:46.880]  they're so scared. Trump now gets that the Democrats can't be reasoned with. They work
[2:12:46.880 --> 2:12:52.200]  for the chai comms and others. They're religion. They're operating system. They're reasoned
[2:12:52.200 --> 2:13:00.040]  for being their ethos. It's not Jesus Christ or Americana or God guts and guns or rugged
[2:13:00.040 --> 2:13:08.960]  individualism. Their ethos is authoritarianism and the American system and its prowess and
[2:13:08.960 --> 2:13:16.600]  its cornucopia of production they can't compete with. So their reason for existence is destroying
[2:13:16.600 --> 2:13:25.440]  Christians and America and Europe. They admit it. That's what's taught at universities.
[2:13:25.440 --> 2:13:29.360]  Because they are the conquering force, not the poor immigrants they brainwash and bring
[2:13:29.360 --> 2:13:38.920]  in and weaponize, but the people running it have decided to be pure evil. They have decided
[2:13:38.920 --> 2:13:47.560]  to cheat at every level. They have decided to join the dark side. And you need to understand
[2:13:47.560 --> 2:13:54.200]  that. You can't approach them at any level like they're rational or you're being nicer.
[2:13:54.200 --> 2:13:59.360]  You virtue signal. You meet them with you are the enemy. You are scum and you are out to
[2:13:59.360 --> 2:14:03.880]  enslave me. You are a would be usurper. You want to conquer me. And when they try to guilt
[2:14:03.880 --> 2:14:08.720]  you and manipulate because they're sociopaths, say get behind me. You rat. Don't you ever
[2:14:08.720 --> 2:14:13.840]  speak to me and you don't buy food at their stores. You don't stay at their hotels. Anything
[2:14:13.840 --> 2:14:21.200]  globalist, anything leftist, you totally cut yourself off from them 100%. We don't go out
[2:14:21.200 --> 2:14:24.360]  and take their bank accounts away and take their websites away like they do to us. These
[2:14:24.360 --> 2:14:30.200]  horrible, dangerous authoritarians. What Soros was doing when he was 15 years old, rounding
[2:14:30.200 --> 2:14:34.360]  up Jews and taking away everything they had and killing them. Shipping them off to be
[2:14:34.360 --> 2:14:39.200]  dead. Let me tell you, he'd line you and your family up in a minute to shove a 45 in their
[2:14:39.200 --> 2:14:44.480]  mouth and blow their brains all over the wall if he could because that makes him feel over.
[2:14:44.480 --> 2:14:52.240]  You understand? He has a spirit that wants to run you into the ground. He wants to destroy
[2:14:52.240 --> 2:14:59.680]  you and his wicked little son. And all these people, the chai comms and in Yonker and Hillary
[2:14:59.680 --> 2:15:05.600]  Clinton, these are all really bad people. They're the worst of the worst. We've had
[2:15:05.600 --> 2:15:10.440]  rotten corruption for a long time that we didn't have people that wanted to literally
[2:15:10.440 --> 2:15:18.760]  destroy prosperity and who literally love ugliness and love poverty. Everywhere that Soros controls
[2:15:18.760 --> 2:15:23.480]  things collapse and there's starvation and little children with their ribs sticking out.
[2:15:23.480 --> 2:15:28.280]  To Soros little kids starving to death and dying in their own feces is the most beautiful
[2:15:28.280 --> 2:15:34.720]  thing on earth to him. A starving child with a crow as it's dying, gasping from saying
[2:15:34.720 --> 2:15:42.120]  mama but it can't go. A black bird pulling an eye out and gobbling it. I mean to Soros,
[2:15:42.120 --> 2:15:48.480]  that is to him, that is like a beautiful sunset. You understand? He wants to rip your children's
[2:15:48.480 --> 2:15:54.120]  eyes out as they die and eat them. And I'm serious.

[2:16:24.480 --> 2:16:29.280]  What if there was a social media network only for the conservative? What if there was a
[2:16:29.280 --> 2:16:33.800]  social media network not only for the conservative right general public but also a platform for
[2:16:33.800 --> 2:16:38.520]  conservative politicians and advertisers? And what if the social media network was the
[2:16:38.520 --> 2:16:43.840]  only free speech network in existence? There is. It's right social dot net. Right social
[2:16:43.840 --> 2:16:48.840]  dot net. A response to President Donald Trump's direct presidential order. Right social dot
[2:16:48.840 --> 2:16:53.280]  net where you have the right to freely speak your mind. Right social dot net. The right
[2:16:53.280 --> 2:16:58.240]  place to be. In these uncertain times, it makes sense to have a sustainable backup method
[2:16:58.240 --> 2:17:02.520]  to cook food and boil water. If your current plan includes using a fuel burning stove or
[2:17:02.520 --> 2:17:06.840]  cooking over an open fire, then there's a much better way. The Minuteman rocket stove
[2:17:06.840 --> 2:17:11.480]  is a biomass burning cooking stove that only requires small quantities of sticks and twigs
[2:17:11.480 --> 2:17:16.120]  for fuel. The Minuteman stove is easy to use, smokeless, portable, powerful and sustainable
[2:17:16.120 --> 2:17:20.800]  for the finest in survival cooking stoves and fire starters made right here in the USA.
[2:17:20.800 --> 2:17:27.080]  Go to Minuteman stove dot com. That's Minuteman stove dot com. Hear that? That's the sound
[2:17:27.080 --> 2:17:33.200]  of a house being trashed while a gang of thieves ransacked the place and what they don't steal
[2:17:33.200 --> 2:17:39.800]  will be destroyed. This year, resolve not to be the next victim of a break in. Go to faketv.com
[2:17:39.800 --> 2:17:44.720]  and discover a device that creates the illusion someone inside is watching TV even when you're
[2:17:44.720 --> 2:17:50.520]  four miles away. Security is a mindset and fake TV should be part of your security solution.
[2:17:50.520 --> 2:17:56.440]  Be vigilant, but not fearful. Fake TV dot com.
[2:17:56.440 --> 2:18:00.800]  Please, whatever you do realize, we're all getting punch drunk to the censorship and
[2:18:00.800 --> 2:18:04.760]  you saw 18 Twitter accounts. They say affiliated with Info Wars. Yes, some of them are like
[2:18:04.760 --> 2:18:08.840]  little side accounts. They even know we had like info or store that just showed our products,
[2:18:08.840 --> 2:18:13.600]  but they just banned them all yesterday in punishment that I'd be in a Trump rally and
[2:18:13.600 --> 2:18:17.800]  be mobbed by all these folks that loved us. Your excitement about America, your excitement
[2:18:17.800 --> 2:18:21.440]  about this broadcast is what brought the country and the world back from the break. But the
[2:18:21.440 --> 2:18:27.200]  globalists now want to target where the resistance came from so that we're not pesky in the future.
[2:18:27.200 --> 2:18:32.960]  I want to be troublesome and pesky. I want to keep going. I want to make them do the
[2:18:32.960 --> 2:18:37.680]  ultimate not just destroy us financially. I want to push all the way. I've committed
[2:18:37.680 --> 2:18:41.800]  to do that. I've prayed for that and I've been told that's going to happen, but you've
[2:18:41.800 --> 2:18:47.320]  got a back ish and I promise you this. I will never falter. I will never waver at the spiritual
[2:18:47.320 --> 2:18:51.680]  level. I physically will, but I give you my commitment. If you financially support us

[2:19:06.920 --> 2:19:11.560]  of a screen and then hours in front of bright lights every day. But thanks to super male

[2:19:21.240 --> 2:19:25.720]  water to fight back against the modern day lifestyle with the screen time and the extended
[2:19:25.720 --> 2:19:31.560]  hours to still have the stamina and endurance, energy and drive to get to the gym, get to

[2:19:49.640 --> 2:20:11.800]  the super male and use the super male vitality at infowarstore.com. You're listening to the
[2:20:11.800 --> 2:20:20.360]  preacher man says it's the end of time. The preacher man says it's the end of time and
[2:20:20.360 --> 2:20:31.480]  the Mississippi River she's a gold grind. The interest is up and the stock market's down
[2:20:31.480 --> 2:20:43.600]  and you're only getting mugged if you go downtown. The last thing they want you to be is self
[2:20:43.600 --> 2:20:47.720]  sufficient whether you live in a city or whether you live in a small town or whether you live
[2:20:47.720 --> 2:20:54.600]  out in the middle of the desert. I got a shotgun a rifle and a four wheel drive and a country
[2:20:54.600 --> 2:21:02.280]  boy can survive. Country folks can survive. Well I tell you people are watching television
[2:21:02.280 --> 2:21:07.640]  right now watching our transmission they're seeing something. I can fly a field all day
[2:21:07.640 --> 2:21:19.000]  long. I can catch catfish from dust till dawn. Oh boy. Make our own whiskey and our own smoke
[2:21:19.000 --> 2:21:26.520]  too. Ain't too many things these old boys can't do. We can build a resistance to the globalists.
[2:21:27.720 --> 2:21:33.640]  We can relaunch the Renaissance. We can defeat the enemy with culture but the average person
[2:21:33.640 --> 2:21:39.960]  really gets motivated and really gets involved but it comes down to us who you can't starve out
[2:21:39.960 --> 2:21:49.400]  but you can't make run. But you know the average person I know people personally who know that
[2:21:49.400 --> 2:21:58.120]  the litmus test it's a statement you have to read on air. George Soros never collaborated
[2:21:58.120 --> 2:22:04.760]  with the Nazis that's a lie by Alex Jones. He survived the Holocaust. He's a philanthropist.
[2:22:04.760 --> 2:22:16.360]  You say that you get boosted on Google, Facebook, Twitter but you do that you sign
[2:22:16.360 --> 2:22:22.920]  on to this right here. That's how evil works. You sign on with somebody like him you might
[2:22:22.920 --> 2:22:27.320]  as well be his companies that are known for destroying African currencies and causing
[2:22:27.320 --> 2:22:35.240]  mass starvation. Same thing in Europe, Latin America. He says someone else would do it.
[2:22:35.240 --> 2:22:41.880]  It's markets. I don't feel bad at all. I was happy making helping round up Jews. I did not do it
[2:22:41.880 --> 2:22:47.480]  because I would have been hurt if I didn't so I did not do it. I simply filled a space.
[2:22:47.480 --> 2:22:58.680]  It was actually the best time of my life. And to say it here on 60 Minutes rubs it in does it not?
[2:23:03.080 --> 2:23:09.880]  Someone has to do it right. Someone with a Transylvanian type of accent perhaps.
[2:23:09.880 --> 2:23:18.520]  So I have someone like that. My father. I would go out with my father.
[2:23:19.400 --> 2:23:27.400]  And we would round people up with my father. My father was always always with me.
[2:23:30.280 --> 2:23:33.480]  Let's get off the subject to George Soros but let's leave that image up.
[2:23:33.480 --> 2:23:41.880]  That's a real image by the way with Soros superimposed over it. I think too dramatic an effect.
[2:23:45.080 --> 2:23:49.000]  See I'm like a tyranny seeking missile spiritually and politically.
[2:23:50.680 --> 2:23:57.080]  And I just can't help but hone into it. That's what we hone in on. Where's the most attack? And I go oh
[2:23:57.800 --> 2:24:01.320]  over here you know it doesn't hurt my feelings. People I've known for many many years say oh
[2:24:01.320 --> 2:24:07.720]  I'm going to have you on my show and then they don't. It's that the litmus test of saying George Soros
[2:24:07.720 --> 2:24:13.080]  is a great guy. Those people become dead basically to you.
[2:24:15.320 --> 2:24:21.640]  And then you get to see them held up to the world as the good guys. Happy making time.
[2:24:21.640 --> 2:24:31.560]  It was happy making for me. Happy making. Happy happy making.
[2:24:35.720 --> 2:24:37.720]  Okay I'm kind of waxing.
[2:24:40.360 --> 2:24:44.840]  That's so taric here today. I'm going to take your phones the next few segments. I'm going to go write
[2:24:44.840 --> 2:24:51.720]  your calls. But you can call a long-time caller, first-time caller by the sat-on hold. You tell

[2:25:03.720 --> 2:25:11.320]  is the toll-free number to join us. 877-789-2539. And we'll take your calls.
[2:25:11.320 --> 2:25:18.680]  It's a pretty big deal to have the world to cry Trump for saying we deserve to have a nation state
[2:25:18.680 --> 2:25:25.640]  and we need an EU empire and a Chinese global chai-com empire that's unelected to rule us
[2:25:25.640 --> 2:25:30.920]  or we're not good moral people. And then these big corporations and these big globalist operations
[2:25:30.920 --> 2:25:36.920]  that are against free market capitalism they want crony fascist communist whatever you want to call
[2:25:36.920 --> 2:25:44.280]  it it uses every system totally evil to oppress everybody and then it points at us saying we're
[2:25:44.280 --> 2:25:49.160]  not going to let you give us one-sided raw deals and they go oh you're so mean you mean
[2:25:50.840 --> 2:25:57.560]  let's play that macron clip one more time because he says patriotism is not standing up for your
[2:25:57.560 --> 2:26:05.160]  nation your culture your history your taxes your institutions it's just letting this I am up the
[2:26:05.160 --> 2:26:11.560]  world bank the unelected EU some other group tell you what to do and then if you try to vote to get
[2:26:11.560 --> 2:26:16.920]  out of it if you're France or whoever voted to be in the EU or if you're the UK oh you can't
[2:26:17.880 --> 2:26:22.840]  that's right it's really evil to say we shouldn't be under something we didn't vote to be under
[2:26:22.840 --> 2:26:30.280]  that says we can't get out of it oh and now it wants a big army to stop nation states from leaving
[2:26:30.280 --> 2:26:35.480]  I might have heard of that before happen oh the Nazis had a plan for the EU
[2:26:38.360 --> 2:26:39.320]  and now it's here
[2:26:42.040 --> 2:26:46.600]  and macron is up there saying we need an EU army last week to stop America
[2:26:52.200 --> 2:26:55.080]  but what they really want is to stop nation states leaving
[2:26:55.080 --> 2:27:01.560]  oh you're gonna try to leave Italy you're gonna try to stop millions coming across the water that
[2:27:01.560 --> 2:27:13.480]  sorrows openly funds we're gonna put the military in ships and stop your Italian navy this is an
[2:27:13.480 --> 2:27:19.160]  invasion which I told you 20 years ago the EU would do the EU army plan the EU court to stop the
[2:27:19.160 --> 2:27:23.800]  nation states from leaving they plan to suck those countries dry all along we have the whole
[2:27:23.800 --> 2:27:33.000]  battle plan here's macron this vision of France has a generous nation with a vision which carries
[2:27:33.000 --> 2:27:39.960]  universal values has been in those dark times exactly the opposite of the selfishness of a people
[2:27:39.960 --> 2:27:46.920]  which only looks at its own interests because patriotism is the exact opposite of nationalism
[2:27:46.920 --> 2:27:54.120]  nationalism is its betrayal by pursuing our own interests first
[2:27:55.320 --> 2:28:00.680]  with no regard to others we erase the very thing that a nation holds most precious
[2:28:01.800 --> 2:28:08.600]  that which gives it life and makes it great its moral values now the finance minister the
[2:28:08.600 --> 2:28:19.560]  technocrat that really runs uh france is saying we need a military for an empire so an empire now
[2:28:19.560 --> 2:28:24.520]  that's right we're going to have your nations be vassal states of our empire we're going to bring
[2:28:24.520 --> 2:28:30.520]  in giant third world populations to drive down your wages and then we can snap our fingers we
[2:28:30.520 --> 2:28:35.800]  politically control they'll burn your cities down so this is how you conquer nations of 24th century
[2:28:35.800 --> 2:28:42.040]  macron wants 500 million that's ices he wants 200 million and the un wants 600 million illegal
[2:28:42.040 --> 2:28:49.240]  aliens to be brought into the us that's all from un documents that's right folks we'll be right back

[2:33:05.080 --> 2:33:15.080]  you
[2:33:15.080 --> 2:33:35.080]  you
[2:33:45.800 --> 2:33:49.080]  you
[2:33:54.680 --> 2:34:01.320]  nobody ever said it was easy to fight authoritarians but all of us who have basic freedoms and
[2:34:01.320 --> 2:34:06.840]  civilization can thank men and women who stood up and did the right thing and made incredible
[2:34:06.840 --> 2:34:12.520]  sacrifices politically physically spiritually economically and so i'm extremely honored to
[2:34:12.520 --> 2:34:18.760]  be demonized to be one of the most demonized people in the world by these mega corporations
[2:34:18.760 --> 2:34:23.800]  that own slave factories that engage in the most horrible criminal activity you can imagine that
[2:34:23.800 --> 2:34:29.240]  don't pay taxes and now as world governments being announced and as borders are being collapsed
[2:34:29.240 --> 2:34:35.000]  by the un and hundreds of millions of people are being told migrate to the west so they can come in
[2:34:35.000 --> 2:34:42.760]  and use our voting system to absolutely enslave us they are all over the place demonizing nation
[2:34:42.760 --> 2:34:49.720]  states and families and mother and father because you can't have a nation state where you have due
[2:34:49.720 --> 2:34:54.280]  process and a bill of rights and a constitution or where you paid in money and you get your pension
[2:34:54.280 --> 2:35:01.640]  back no no no no no nationalism is evil having countries is evil so trump comes out a few weeks
[2:35:01.640 --> 2:35:06.360]  go and says nationalism is good to have your own country you don't want to have some unelected eu
[2:35:06.360 --> 2:35:12.200]  running your life or some unelected tpp running your life that he pulled out of some authoritarian
[2:35:12.200 --> 2:35:19.480]  and system that you can't even call you can't even sue the meetings are secret the eu is
[2:35:19.480 --> 2:35:24.360]  unelected people even vote to enter it and now macron comes out of the weekend and criticizes
[2:35:24.360 --> 2:35:31.560]  the president to his face and england for pulling out of the eu and says nationalism
[2:35:32.760 --> 2:35:40.040]  is the opposite of patriotism now that is that is totally and completely idiotic isn't it let's
[2:35:40.040 --> 2:35:47.080]  pull up one and telegraph one independent that they've all got it the eu was the brain trust
[2:35:47.080 --> 2:35:55.720]  and the plan of adolf Hitler after he was defeated the marshal plan picked it up and the plan just
[2:35:55.720 --> 2:36:04.280]  continued nazis created basic plan for european union that is a fact and now they say this
[2:36:04.280 --> 2:36:09.720]  unelected thing is better than germany or france or sweden and now the nation states are trying to
[2:36:09.720 --> 2:36:13.640]  pull out they're saying we're not going to be under the un treaty that says our borders are wide open
[2:36:13.640 --> 2:36:18.120]  they run it so austria and hungary are pulling out and idly's pulling out so they're like well
[2:36:18.120 --> 2:36:24.440]  we're gonna have an eu army that comes in and stops you that's the finance minister of france
[2:36:24.440 --> 2:36:31.000]  you're not getting away we're forming an army that'll stop your army oh i think we heard of that
[2:36:31.000 --> 2:36:40.200]  hitler's plan an eu army to keep the european union in line this is the reality
[2:36:40.200 --> 2:36:48.520]  and trump is trying to fight it this is the new authoritarianism so on the heels of that
[2:36:49.880 --> 2:36:57.800]  nationalism is bad speech tv brainwashing secretary elizabeth mccord delivers a thought
[2:36:57.800 --> 2:37:06.520]  provoking speech in season five premiere episode of e pluribus unum madam secretary on sunday's
[2:37:06.520 --> 2:37:16.920]  ten eastern nine central on cbs all unifying the propaganda that the nation state is bad here it is
[2:37:18.600 --> 2:37:25.800]  madam secretary thank you mr president and thank you prime minister country prime minister
[2:37:25.800 --> 2:37:31.720]  we daily your courage and determination have made humankind safer from the second greatest
[2:37:31.720 --> 2:37:41.400]  threat it faces what is an even greater threat than nuclear weapons that which makes the use
[2:37:41.400 --> 2:37:50.840]  of them possible hate specifically the blind hatred one group or nation can have for another
[2:37:51.560 --> 2:37:58.760]  and that is why i am convinced that nationalism is the existential threat of our time i want to be
[2:37:58.760 --> 2:38:07.720]  clear nationalism is not the same as patriotism it's a perversion of patriotism nationalism the
[2:38:07.720 --> 2:38:13.720]  belief system held by those who attacked us promotes the idea that inclusion and diversity
[2:38:13.720 --> 2:38:20.680]  represent weakness that the only way to succeed is to give blind allegiance to the supremacy of one
[2:38:20.680 --> 2:38:27.720]  race over all others nothing could be less america i didn't pause i i can't listen anymore of this
[2:38:27.720 --> 2:38:33.560]  this is exactly what micron just said they're the globalists they have the nazi u system they're
[2:38:33.560 --> 2:38:40.040]  taking over they funded the europe spring to blow away modern regimes and put in radical islamic ones
[2:38:40.760 --> 2:38:44.920]  they're the ones saying you can't have your family you can't have your free market you can't be a
[2:38:44.920 --> 2:38:50.520]  christian you've got to do what we say don't use mother and father or boy or girl in school forms
[2:38:50.520 --> 2:38:56.600]  they're the ones saying we can have no identity well they then bring in the third world to politically
[2:38:56.600 --> 2:39:04.920]  control them this is so sick and it's just everywhere and it's bombarding people everywhere of
[2:39:04.920 --> 2:39:11.560]  course patriotism is about your nation strong good nation good people limited laws resources strong
[2:39:11.560 --> 2:39:18.920]  people vibrant other nations falling apart run by collectivist run by globalists being looted
[2:39:18.920 --> 2:39:25.480]  and america's halfway there we try to pull out in the entire corporate media begins this attack on
[2:39:25.480 --> 2:39:31.240]  the idea of a nation state to counter national nation state movements all over the world saying no
[2:39:31.240 --> 2:39:37.800]  to an unelected eu coming in and opening its borders to collapsing africa and and and the
[2:39:37.800 --> 2:39:44.920]  middle east which the globalist collapsed on purpose to then collapse europe and the united
[2:39:44.920 --> 2:39:50.840]  states i've got the articles right here from micron wants 200 million north africans to come to
[2:39:50.840 --> 2:39:58.840]  europe and france micron walks back his migration talk revealed you and plan to flood america with
[2:39:58.840 --> 2:40:04.920]  600 million migrants this is their stated plan i'm gonna go to your calls the next segment this is
[2:40:04.920 --> 2:40:09.160]  very hard to stomach but let's try to finish watching this can you imagine the type of idiots
[2:40:09.160 --> 2:40:14.600]  that watch and believe this the type that watch cobert say that i that info wars that paul watson
[2:40:14.600 --> 2:40:20.040]  faked a video that accoste never touched her and then he shows the video of him touching her and
[2:40:20.040 --> 2:40:27.080]  says it's fake what the i mean these people are incredible here it is treatism on the other hand
[2:40:27.080 --> 2:40:34.280]  is about building each other up and embracing our diversity as the source of our nation's strength
[2:40:34.280 --> 2:40:40.040]  we the people means all hit pause again the other name of the show e pluribus unum yet unified by

[2:41:08.520 --> 2:41:15.800]  god i mean every millisecond of this is pure crap continue freedom from tyranny which requires
[2:41:15.800 --> 2:41:22.040]  our unwavering support because again unwavering support for the globalist and then remember
[2:41:22.040 --> 2:41:27.640]  whenever obama said and and and don't i can't do a good obama people said there's always tyranny

[2:47:45.880 --> 2:47:50.680]  bill of rights best lawyers say but some different attack plans that that that folks wouldn't think
[2:47:50.680 --> 2:48:00.040]  of generally and some key angles for the president like this president the eu by extension where this
[2:48:00.040 --> 2:48:03.880]  regulation is already regulating the internet you need to come in with prohibitions blocking
[2:48:03.880 --> 2:48:09.080]  censorship and cartel activity you saw in last week say just that i had three different law firms
[2:48:09.080 --> 2:48:13.880]  put three different packages together with different angles and i got them to the president
[2:48:13.880 --> 2:48:20.200]  and let's say all hell broke loose when i did i mean i get punished every time i do this

[2:50:00.520 --> 2:50:06.200]  by ngo's surprise surprise the un is lying and organizing criminal activity
[2:50:07.400 --> 2:50:13.160]  but we're gonna go to everybody so let's go to who's that gonna go to first
[2:50:16.200 --> 2:50:20.440]  i guess we're gonna go to george in connecticut thanks for holding her on the air
[2:50:22.040 --> 2:50:28.280]  hi there alex um the weekend before the election i saw i can fortunately i flip around a lot so i
[2:50:28.280 --> 2:50:34.920]  don't i wasn't sure in which network aware but but they saw the chinese ambassador uh basically
[2:50:34.920 --> 2:50:39.400]  being interviewed and he made no bones about they spent hundreds of billions of dollars in front of
[2:50:39.400 --> 2:50:45.320]  influence the the political scene in america and i'm sure it's more like a billion dollars but you
[2:50:45.320 --> 2:50:51.560]  know we know that they underestimate this unfortunately i couldn't tell if it was the the the um ambassador
[2:50:51.560 --> 2:50:56.520]  or the ambassador of the united states i think that's an important issue uh there's a second
[2:50:56.520 --> 2:51:01.880]  issue but i'll let you comment on that there's a second issue i want to bring up state that
[2:51:01.880 --> 2:51:07.960]  again because your phone was breaking up during one part i said the the the chinese ambassador
[2:51:07.960 --> 2:51:14.920]  just before their election was uh being interviewed on one of the major networks and he made no
[2:51:14.920 --> 2:51:20.600]  bones about it that he spent hundreds of millions of dollars in in trying to influence oh yes i saw
[2:51:20.600 --> 2:51:25.800]  that i saw that and they don't even hide it and then the same it was the ambassador to the un
[2:51:25.800 --> 2:51:30.440]  and they also basically said that at the un he said big deal this is open and shut
[2:51:31.160 --> 2:51:37.160]  collusion and then there's none with the russians the republicans can destroy the democrats
[2:51:37.160 --> 2:51:41.240]  and they keep trying to take you the quote high road no that's taking the low road let
[2:51:41.240 --> 2:51:46.440]  him commit these crimes uh i i saw the articles where he admitted that uh what channel was he on
[2:51:46.440 --> 2:51:51.240]  george when you saw that uh that's that way i wasn't absolutely sure it may have been a an nbc
[2:51:51.240 --> 2:51:56.520]  but i can't be absolutely sure i think i flip around a lot so that's why i made my job no sir
[2:51:56.520 --> 2:52:02.120]  i know it's it's totally insane and i appreciate your call what was the other point the other point
[2:52:02.120 --> 2:52:07.880]  is i think one of the things that i think should be made an issue of all this nonsense with refugees
[2:52:07.880 --> 2:52:12.360]  children etc etc i was out into long island south iskandl i don't have to tell you what's going on
[2:52:12.360 --> 2:52:18.840]  there with the so-called uh dreamers who baby basically ms 13 but the the real point i'm getting at
[2:52:18.840 --> 2:52:24.360]  is that every one of these people are put on social security they're basically destroying the social
[2:52:24.360 --> 2:52:30.120]  security system everyone that's also absolutely that's why socialists now all over europe are
[2:52:30.120 --> 2:52:33.960]  joining with the right wing saying no more because now they learned document camp shot i appreciate
[2:52:33.960 --> 2:52:40.120]  your call george i was about to flash back to this article in july 2016 when they'd taken down
[2:52:40.120 --> 2:52:45.800]  ukraine i talked about it months before they even said it soros plots european order coup
[2:52:45.800 --> 2:52:50.440]  e you will disintegrate rise again under new marshal plan that's always been the plan
[2:52:50.440 --> 2:52:55.960]  build it up plunge it bankrupt the countries bailing the e you out and then take over with
[2:52:55.960 --> 2:53:00.600]  an e you army this what you just said is the plan sir it's the plan here it's the plan everywhere it
[2:53:00.600 --> 2:53:06.760]  is unbelievable it's clowered and pivoted on steroids all right carlos in montreal canada
[2:53:06.760 --> 2:53:12.520]  carlos you're on the air worldwide thanks for calling thank you alex um i agree with you i think
[2:53:12.520 --> 2:53:19.480]  it's time to focus take name and number and to start um identifying the dimensions which are
[2:53:19.480 --> 2:53:26.760]  weakening the united states so greatly um the globalists have been able to monetize uh themselves
[2:53:27.320 --> 2:53:32.760]  over the years to the point now that they've got trillions of dollars everyone's in debt to who
[2:53:32.760 --> 2:53:37.400]  i mean you know look trillion here a trillion there pretty soon you're talking real money
[2:53:37.400 --> 2:53:42.600]  and in the context of what the president united states has a responsibility to do
[2:53:42.600 --> 2:53:49.640]  is to stop them monetizing these people take the treasury and restore it to the united states of
[2:53:49.640 --> 2:53:55.720]  america the the the money printing oh you're absolutely right the trial has pointed out the
[2:53:55.720 --> 2:54:02.360]  private over private federal reserve is sabotaging the recovery and he needs to exercise power over
[2:54:02.360 --> 2:54:07.000]  it and not be bamboozled that it's this separate thing that's above the law no branch of governments
[2:54:07.000 --> 2:54:11.640]  above the law and it's not even in the government uh so we need to go after that we have to absolutely
[2:54:11.640 --> 2:54:16.360]  go after all the foreign meddling we have to go on the offense can you believe the democrats
[2:54:16.360 --> 2:54:20.840]  have announced hearings they're going to have into trump's attacks on the free press when
[2:54:20.840 --> 2:54:25.240]  it's the democrats and the and the deep state openly trying to destroy free speech and free
[2:54:25.240 --> 2:54:29.880]  press in this country and it was obama that persecuted the living snot out of hundreds of
[2:54:29.880 --> 2:54:36.520]  reporters he had arrested alex but it isn't that you see that's reacting to them it's like you
[2:54:36.520 --> 2:54:40.680]  remember in school when you use somebody said oh but you're ugly oh no i'm not ugly i once
[2:54:40.680 --> 2:54:44.680]  was a weak beauty contest oh no but your father no no i agree we need to we need to get out of
[2:54:44.680 --> 2:54:48.440]  the u n and stop funding him to stop the migrant waves that they're running and we need to have
[2:54:48.440 --> 2:54:54.200]  the trump take over the federal reserve we have to stop them controlling the agenda and
[2:54:54.200 --> 2:55:00.280]  our defending all the time it's about time that we actually start showing the real non-doctor
[2:55:00.280 --> 2:55:06.440]  videos the videos for instance like the one that you know john rivers once made and and you
[2:55:06.440 --> 2:55:13.640]  showed so clearly that the video wasn't doctor neither was michelle obama okay no the point this
[2:55:13.640 --> 2:55:19.000]  is that it's at the level that people will begin well i mean there's no doubt that women don't have
[2:55:19.000 --> 2:55:25.400]  shoulders like that and it's not that alex is the fact that we that you're always reacting to an
[2:55:25.400 --> 2:55:31.240]  attack and the whole point is to keep your one foot instead of covering the real let me explain
[2:55:31.240 --> 2:55:36.040]  something if paul would never responded because i've gone with that tactic you just said
[2:55:36.040 --> 2:55:40.360]  if paul wouldn't respond to them saying that was fake and had forensic experts come out and say no
[2:55:40.360 --> 2:55:44.680]  it wasn't fake they were planning to take him off uh and they're gonna do it anyways but but that's
[2:55:44.680 --> 2:55:49.800]  what i'm saying i understand sir but at the same time to your audience you have to address things
[2:55:49.800 --> 2:55:53.400]  that aren't true or they'll believe it so i have to tell the audience when they come out and say
[2:55:53.400 --> 2:56:01.000]  this stuff that we didn't do it yes but if a corporation for instance uh a media conglomerate
[2:56:01.000 --> 2:56:06.040]  is not serving the best interests of the american people all right they have a charter uh yes sir
[2:56:06.040 --> 2:56:10.600]  listen i hear you uh cnn is cancer they're all trying to shut down the free press i appreciate
[2:56:10.600 --> 2:56:15.560]  your call uh they're openly at war with the president this nation is at war they are enemies of
[2:56:15.560 --> 2:56:20.680]  the people and trump has identified it and it's just getting worse and worse and worse and and
[2:56:20.680 --> 2:56:25.080]  here's the deal i don't want to shut them down they're trying to shut us down so when someone
[2:56:25.080 --> 2:56:29.480]  makes the move to overthrow your country they're no longer under the bill of rights and constitution
[2:56:29.480 --> 2:56:33.960]  it's whoever makes the first move i totally hear what you're saying we are dealing with criminals
[2:56:33.960 --> 2:56:40.680]  we are dealing with organized foreign powers and the president knows that but he's afraid to tank
[2:56:40.680 --> 2:56:44.360]  the stock market if he gets too aggressive because people can't handle the truth man
[2:56:45.640 --> 2:56:48.360]  we're gonna come back take more calls mike adams is coming up with a lot of studying

[2:58:20.360 --> 2:58:25.000]  get you want to yourself you want to your family and you owe it to the future of this country in
[2:58:25.000 --> 2:58:31.240]  the world that patriots stay as healthy and as clean and as focused as you can be because we need
[2:58:31.240 --> 2:58:36.520]  you the remnant of america to reignite those brush fires the next level and to be healthy and as
[2:58:36.520 --> 2:58:40.680]  focused as you can be thanks to your support and your prayers together we're changing the world
[2:58:40.680 --> 2:58:44.440]  now it's time to change our bodies with z shield and info wars life dot com
[2:58:44.440 --> 2:58:50.760]  please whatever you do realize that we're all getting punch drunk to the censorship and you
[2:58:50.760 --> 2:58:55.160]  saw 18 twitter accounts they say affiliated with info wars yes some of them are like little side
[2:58:55.160 --> 2:58:59.480]  accounts they even know we had like info were stored that just showed our products but they just
[2:58:59.480 --> 2:59:04.520]  banned them all yesterday in punishment that i'd be in a trump rally and be mobbed by all these
[2:59:04.520 --> 2:59:08.840]  folks that loved us your excitement about america your excitement about this broadcast is what brought
[2:59:08.840 --> 2:59:13.560]  the country and the world back from the brick but the globalists now want to target where the
[2:59:13.560 --> 2:59:20.040]  resistance came from so that we're not pesky in the future i want to be troublesome and pesky
[2:59:20.040 --> 2:59:25.320]  i want to keep going i want to make them do the ultimate not just destroy us financially i want
[2:59:25.320 --> 2:59:30.440]  to push all the way i've committed to do that i've prayed for that and i've been told that's
[2:59:30.440 --> 2:59:35.880]  going to happen but you've got a backish and i promise you this i will never falter i will never
[2:59:35.880 --> 2:59:40.760]  waver at the spiritual level i physically will but i give you my commitment if you financially
[2:59:40.760 --> 2:59:45.400]  support us at foreshore.com to give you my absolute total commitment
[2:59:45.400 --> 3:00:15.240]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[3:00:15.800 --> 3:00:27.320]  all right mike adams is coming up at 15 after the host three segments of the broadcast always
[3:00:27.320 --> 3:00:32.360]  informative look forward to that then the war room three to six with oan stroyer roger stoner and
[3:00:32.360 --> 3:00:36.040]  others we're going to take a few more calls from matt and others here in just a moment but but first
[3:00:36.040 --> 3:00:42.280]  off i want to explain something we've gotten a lot of phone calls i've seen some comments even
[3:00:42.280 --> 3:00:46.760]  though it's gotten five star reviews and in forestore.com the people are confused they're like
[3:00:47.480 --> 3:00:55.640]  x3 shows a little bit less iodine on the back than x2 well that's because the latest statements by
[3:00:55.640 --> 3:01:01.000]  the fda is they think it should be lower and they're going to lower stuff down to zero soon but just
[3:01:01.000 --> 3:01:08.840]  to play ball with all of the baloney we have a lower dose that you're supposed to take whatever
[3:01:08.840 --> 3:01:13.400]  you think or whatever your physician thinks that is best for you you do that you judge it okay
[3:01:14.920 --> 3:01:22.200]  also we used to put out a seaweed base that was very very clean but not very strong and then we
[3:01:22.200 --> 3:01:25.960]  found a deep growth crystal source that was so amazing and had that for five years and then
[3:01:25.960 --> 3:01:30.200]  i got kind of put over a barrel getting it it cost too much so we went out and found another
[3:01:30.840 --> 3:01:37.720]  pharmaceutical level institution manufacturer that had the dea letters and all the stuff to get it
[3:01:37.720 --> 3:01:42.440]  to where they could get the very same or even stronger deep earth crystals but then it was
[3:01:42.440 --> 3:01:46.600]  explained to me by chemists and others that a very small percentage of people can't absorb pure
[3:01:46.600 --> 3:01:50.760]  atomic iodine even though it's the best type so there's a little bit of the other two types of
[3:01:50.760 --> 3:01:56.920]  iodine in there so i could easily call it x3 when you reformulate it haven't be the exact
[3:01:56.920 --> 3:02:03.880]  same formula this is a new formula because we believe it is the best that's what we've done
[3:02:03.880 --> 3:02:12.520]  with x3 and again ladies and gentlemen it's extremely pure all three types of iodine that
[3:02:12.520 --> 3:02:17.480]  are in it are extremely pure it has the atomic iodine then has the other two types of iodine
[3:02:17.480 --> 3:02:23.320]  in it and it has a tiny bit of vitamin c that keeps it from oxidizing it would be black if it
[3:02:23.320 --> 3:02:27.320]  didn't have that in there it's so pure and so strong because that's the oxidization instead
[3:02:27.320 --> 3:02:35.560]  it's like this beautiful orange glowing color that turns blue on paper which is the atomic color
[3:02:36.200 --> 3:02:44.440]  of iodine kind of a blue purplish uh crystal color so survival shield x3 is from our research
[3:02:44.440 --> 3:02:49.880]  the very best iodine you can get i've seen some people say well doesn't matter i want the original
[3:02:49.880 --> 3:02:54.360]  x2 you know what i can reformulate and call it x2 if you want that and i'll have the other two
[3:02:54.360 --> 3:02:59.080]  iodines i just have two different types whatever you want but this isn't us unable to get the
[3:02:59.080 --> 3:03:04.040]  deep earth crystals we're able to now we have a contract it's that it's better from our research
[3:03:04.040 --> 3:03:15.880]  to have all three types x3 is 50% off for only but the sales only going for another five six days
[3:03:15.880 --> 3:03:22.120]  so you can get your x3 50% off and with free shipping at info or store.com or enforce live.com
[3:03:22.120 --> 3:03:28.520]  and yes ladies and gentlemen you can get x2 still we our last big order of it's huge
[3:03:28.520 --> 3:03:32.600]  it'll probably be a long time to win get more if put a new order in it takes time but if people
[3:03:32.600 --> 3:03:39.400]  want x2 we'll remanufacture x2 for you all day long x3 is better in my view the difference
[3:03:39.400 --> 3:03:43.960]  grows for different folks and i forget to take my daily dose every day i a lot of times and then
[3:03:43.960 --> 3:03:49.960]  i really feel it later stamina libido energy it really is magic and that's why there's this whole
[3:03:49.960 --> 3:03:54.040]  iodine conspiracy of giving you bad halogen it's not the good halogen mike adams is coming up in
[3:03:54.040 --> 3:03:57.640]  about 10 minutes mike i know you're loaded for bear my friend what are you going to be covering
[3:03:58.440 --> 3:04:02.280]  well when you open the show this morning and you you talked about how we need to have a bigger
[3:04:02.280 --> 3:04:08.200]  picture point of view i'm going to be covering that because the election fraud and the the the
[3:04:08.200 --> 3:04:13.320]  criminal fraud of the democrats and the deception is really just a symptom of assaults on consciousness
[3:04:13.320 --> 3:04:17.960]  and assaults on humanity so that's going to cover that in a much bigger point of view some of the
[3:04:17.960 --> 3:04:23.240]  things you mentioned but also expanding it to other areas it's i've got a lot coming up but i
[3:04:23.240 --> 3:04:28.280]  think all of us in an instinctive and spiritual level get trumps great nationalism is great but
[3:04:28.280 --> 3:04:33.960]  this battle this war so so out of control we have to change people fundamentally at the consciousness
[3:04:33.960 --> 3:04:39.240]  level well exactly there there are many people who are trump supporters but they're still destroying
[3:04:39.240 --> 3:04:44.040]  their minds and their bodies with 5g radiation or fluoride poisoning we really have to be
[3:04:44.040 --> 3:04:48.760]  uh healthier and more conscious and aware if we're going to win this battle at every level so that's
[3:04:49.800 --> 3:04:52.120]  well naturalnews.com's mike adams

[3:06:12.360 --> 3:06:17.080]  minutes i was just about to go to matt he just hung up we're going to go to brad and judy and
[3:06:17.080 --> 3:06:22.760]  jerome and jesse and a few others here right now brad and pencil vanya thanks for holding you're on
[3:06:22.760 --> 3:06:27.880]  the air what do you make of this election they're openly stealing florida they just looks like they're
[3:06:27.880 --> 3:06:33.400]  going to steal uh that that whole situation in arizona it's so transparent this is insane
[3:06:33.400 --> 3:06:40.680]  it's unbelievable alex it continues to happen and our election systems a absolute joke i don't
[3:06:40.680 --> 3:06:46.280]  know how anybody can say it isn't it's it's i don't know what the solution is but it's completely
[3:06:46.280 --> 3:06:52.280]  off the chain it's ridiculous and i i know trump's on top of florida but it's probably maybe
[3:06:52.280 --> 3:06:57.720]  too little too late and the stuff that that was captured on video is awesome whoever caught that
[3:06:57.720 --> 3:07:02.840]  stuff to document it thank god for that and of course it's a famous county that's been convicted
[3:07:02.840 --> 3:07:08.360]  of doing this over and over again and and that the trump can't do everything he's under attack
[3:07:08.360 --> 3:07:13.880]  from every angle it's just insane and he's all by himself no one no one steps up to help him
[3:07:13.880 --> 3:07:18.440]  i feel so sorry for that guy i mean and it's because men in this country more than anybody
[3:07:19.400 --> 3:07:24.040]  think going along with the system gets them ahead and so no one will stick their neck out until we
[3:07:24.040 --> 3:07:31.000]  all lose our necks because of the incredible cowardice and the media and the newspapers the
[3:07:31.000 --> 3:07:37.000]  television media i mean they're just demonizing anything everyone from all different sides
[3:07:37.000 --> 3:07:43.000]  including trump you guys you guys do an excellent job i said this the only night after you left i
[3:07:43.000 --> 3:07:48.360]  said you guys deserve a pure surprise and all they do is just cut you down every which way just
[3:07:48.360 --> 3:07:53.160]  because they know it's the truth and they got they have to demonize it they have to get absolutely
[3:07:53.160 --> 3:07:56.680]  well it's a badge of honor because these people really are globalist enemies they've taken the
[3:07:56.680 --> 3:08:01.080]  country over it's true what trump says he says i don't want to say this but it's true i have to these
[3:08:01.080 --> 3:08:05.960]  are literally enemies that doesn't mean we go attack them like antifa does us it means they
[3:08:05.960 --> 3:08:09.960]  really hate the country they hate nationalism they hate us existing because they work for a
[3:08:09.960 --> 3:08:14.920]  bunch of ruthless global corporations that are tax exempt these people do not have any
[3:08:14.920 --> 3:08:21.560]  moral authority they are frauds god bless you brad great points jesse in my home state of texas
[3:08:21.560 --> 3:08:27.560]  you're on the air thanks for holding hey thank you so much for having me on alex thanks brother go
[3:08:27.560 --> 3:08:34.440]  ahead well i had a couple of bible passages on the on the very serious subject of life extension
[3:08:35.160 --> 3:08:39.240]  i saw that you were sort of struggling with it and i just wanted to give christian support
[3:08:40.120 --> 3:08:46.120]  i think two passages that are relevant in matthew when you therefore shall see the
[3:08:46.120 --> 3:08:55.880]  abomination of desolation spoken by daniel the prophet stand in the holy place some people take
[3:08:55.880 --> 3:09:05.000]  that to mean androids or clones i think that's a really interesting interpretation i mean i
[3:09:05.000 --> 3:09:09.240]  remember hearing different pastors say when they talk about the image of the beast will be seen
[3:09:09.240 --> 3:09:17.480]  worldwide and will be you know huge but it'll be you know like a man but not i think that's
[3:09:17.480 --> 3:09:23.480]  will be these ai avatars that people are then made to worship which the globalists say that will be
[3:09:23.480 --> 3:09:29.880]  the new global god well avatar is a really interesting word because they keep throwing
[3:09:29.880 --> 3:09:36.360]  that in our face all the time with movies you could project like a video game into an avatar and
[3:09:36.360 --> 3:09:41.560]  move it around yeah they're it's demon possession they're telling you what they're doing yeah well
[3:09:41.560 --> 3:09:45.880]  the other passage and i just want to support you today with what you were doing because i saw it
[3:09:45.880 --> 3:09:54.840]  was a very serious subject in revelation nine six and in those days shall men seek death and shall
[3:09:54.840 --> 3:10:01.480]  not find it and shall desire to die and death shall flee from them i think that's an interesting
[3:10:01.480 --> 3:10:07.560]  passage in the same context well yeah let us say they'll sit under the mountains and caves and beat
[3:10:07.560 --> 3:10:13.480]  themselves on the head wishing god would let them die but god won't that's revelation six you kind
[3:10:13.480 --> 3:10:18.200]  of have to skip but that's i think how revelation is structured i love this passage because it gives
[3:10:18.200 --> 3:10:23.640]  me so much faith and you know they've got it lined up in the king and notice notice notice the
[3:10:23.640 --> 3:10:32.200]  globalists are in their bunkers yeah wishing they could die right well i do knows what kind of
[3:10:32.200 --> 3:10:39.400]  manipulation and extortion they have in the kings of the earth and the great men and the rich men
[3:10:39.400 --> 3:10:46.920]  and the chief captains and the mighty men and every bondman and every free man hid themselves in the
[3:10:46.920 --> 3:10:54.120]  dens and in the rocks of the mountains i get so much comfort from that when you and donald trump
[3:10:54.120 --> 3:10:59.320]  are out there and you're running interference for the rest of us and you're fighting the good fight
[3:10:59.320 --> 3:11:05.800]  i want to say bless you alex jones i pray for you strength and encouragement sends you peace
[3:11:05.800 --> 3:11:13.000]  and courage i love what you're doing my one criticism today is right now there are bombs
[3:11:13.000 --> 3:11:17.480]  on the gaza strip i'd love to hear coverage of that but when i see that heaviness of this
[3:11:17.480 --> 3:11:23.640]  subject of life extension you've been out there since community access talking about clones
[3:11:23.640 --> 3:11:29.880]  and androids and i just want christians to pray for you because this is why they're coming after
[3:11:29.880 --> 3:11:37.240]  you i think is the deep dark secrets the disclosure of the deep underground military bases i actually
[3:11:37.240 --> 3:11:43.080]  live in noxial tennessee but i went to college in austin i love what you're doing sir god bless you
[3:11:43.080 --> 3:11:47.960]  for the kind words jesse and let's remember the military is some of our best people it's why they
[3:11:47.960 --> 3:11:53.720]  want to replace them with robots the globalist command most these bases are under un uh they're
[3:11:53.720 --> 3:12:00.520]  under uh nasa uh they're under shadow government operations the military isn't even involved in
[3:12:00.520 --> 3:12:06.200]  a lot of them uh is just only here deep underground military bases it's all the DARPA breakaway
[3:12:06.200 --> 3:12:11.080]  civilization and that's why our military has to understand in the final phases they're supposed
[3:12:11.080 --> 3:12:16.680]  to be cut off they're supposed to be given bad vaccines they're supposed to be treated like
[3:12:16.680 --> 3:12:21.320]  absolute crap and then basically phased out that's why they're putting transgenders in the military
[3:12:21.320 --> 3:12:27.960]  all of this is to kill readiness sabotage the military uh ahead of the machine rollout which
[3:12:27.960 --> 3:12:32.120]  is way more advanced than the public's telling uh than than the establishment telling the public
[3:12:32.120 --> 3:12:37.000]  thank you jesse real fast judy in florida thanks for calling go ahead judy welcome
[3:12:38.760 --> 3:12:44.680]  hey alex um and just in following up what you've been saying today about uh what you know prophecy
[3:12:44.680 --> 3:12:50.840]  has been being fulfilled and speaking about the rfid chip for like newbies or people that just
[3:12:50.840 --> 3:12:56.120]  really don't know what prophecy you're talking about and he goes it goes direct to scripture and
[3:12:56.120 --> 3:13:02.360]  i know you've talked about john on the isle pat most and his direct um prophecy that he was given
[3:13:02.360 --> 3:13:11.000]  by jesus himself it goes to revelation 1316 through 17 and he causes all both small and great rich
[3:13:11.000 --> 3:13:17.800]  and poor free and bond to receive a mark in their right hand or in their foreheads and that no man
[3:13:17.800 --> 3:13:24.840]  might buy or sell say that he had the mark or the name of the beast or the number of his name
[3:13:24.840 --> 3:13:30.840]  and he is satan and you know and i don't want you to just start preaching on air i love how you
[3:13:30.840 --> 3:13:36.920]  reveal jesus in in your words and deeds already you're not meant to just you know do raw preaching
[3:13:36.920 --> 3:13:41.880]  your your whether it's the book of revelations which we're living in which i believe we are but
[3:13:41.880 --> 3:13:50.760]  it be that as it may we're supposed to move forward as um the image of god in his creation
[3:13:50.760 --> 3:13:56.040]  and that's what you know i'm in 100 agreeing with you well man the reason i i mean i'd be more
[3:13:56.040 --> 3:14:00.520]  than happy to be you know sit up here and and and just be a classic preacher just those guys are all
[3:14:00.520 --> 3:14:04.600]  kind of shuttered they don't see what's happening they don't tell people to go out and confront it
[3:14:05.400 --> 3:14:09.480]  and i just simply tell atheists anybody whether you believe in this or not this is classical
[3:14:09.480 --> 3:14:16.520]  authoritarianism it's manifesting now and we know where this goes and you and people really should be
[3:14:16.520 --> 3:14:21.720]  aware they really be should be concerned thank you duty now mike adams is all lined up ready to go
[3:14:21.720 --> 3:14:25.960]  i apologize to their collars but we can take like 20 calls so i got to a lot of them today

[3:18:35.960 --> 3:18:42.760]  that by combining it with three other compounds two forms of iodine and vitamin c it super charges it

[3:20:00.120 --> 3:20:15.480]  leading a frontal assault on the lives of the new world order it's alex jones with mike adams
[3:20:19.640 --> 3:20:24.040]  welcome back to the alex jones show fourth hour i'm stepping in for the next three segments
[3:20:24.040 --> 3:20:29.800]  and i've been listening watching the show today alex's opening segment hit the mark perfectly
[3:20:29.800 --> 3:20:35.080]  about what's really at stake and how we need to expand our view of what's happening i've also
[3:20:35.080 --> 3:20:40.680]  been listening to the callers i want to say bless all of you who have called it seems to be a very
[3:20:40.680 --> 3:20:45.880]  spiritual day for some reason there's a there's a spiritual moment of awakening happening right
[3:20:45.880 --> 3:20:52.040]  now where all of us realize that the intense evil of the democrats how they are willing to steal
[3:20:52.040 --> 3:20:58.520]  elections and commit fraud and lie lie to the voters and lie lie to win elections and how
[3:20:58.520 --> 3:21:04.920]  they're willing to commit a deep state treason and how the media is so dishonest they just blatantly
[3:21:04.920 --> 3:21:11.560]  lie about that jim acosta video for example the realization is that this is not simply a war about
[3:21:11.560 --> 3:21:18.200]  what are facts this isn't a war about different points of view this is a spiritual war and it's
[3:21:18.200 --> 3:21:28.440]  a war that has at stake the sustainability of even human consciousness or human souls on this earth
[3:21:28.440 --> 3:21:34.520]  and so this is a really important time for us to to step back and get a big big picture a cosmic
[3:21:34.520 --> 3:21:39.160]  picture you might say a spiritual picture a divine picture about what's actually happening and
[3:21:39.160 --> 3:21:46.040]  understand where the causes are of these problems that we are now experiencing because look the
[3:21:46.040 --> 3:21:53.400]  democrats are operating not only with a complete lack of good faith now when it comes to elections
[3:21:53.400 --> 3:21:59.640]  they're operating with intense evil as if they have been taken over and the humanity has been
[3:21:59.640 --> 3:22:06.280]  drained out of them and there are just let's say metaphorically just demonic spirits now
[3:22:06.280 --> 3:22:13.480]  operating those democrats and through that demonic spirit they're trying to crush all human dignity
[3:22:13.480 --> 3:22:21.400]  crush consciousness destroy truth destroy the lives of unborn babies as well they revel in death
[3:22:21.400 --> 3:22:27.560]  and suffering and their policies create suffering and yet they can never take responsibility for
[3:22:27.560 --> 3:22:32.440]  their policies and the effects that they create they always have to blame trump when they have to
[3:22:32.440 --> 3:22:37.160]  blame the russians they have to make up something to blame because they can never blame themselves
[3:22:37.160 --> 3:22:43.960]  for the hellish outcomes that they have created and so our role in this and I promise I'm going
[3:22:43.960 --> 3:22:51.080]  to get more practical here this isn't just a spiritual discussion our role is to number one
[3:22:51.080 --> 3:22:56.520]  recognize what's happening recognize that this is a spiritual battle taking place and that they
[3:22:56.520 --> 3:23:01.880]  don't just want our society they don't just want control of the house or control of the senate
[3:23:01.880 --> 3:23:11.480]  they want our souls they want to crush and destroy everything that is of god do you understand the
[3:23:11.480 --> 3:23:19.000]  severity of the of their attack on our our entire universe you might even say it's an attack on
[3:23:19.560 --> 3:23:28.440]  god and all those who embrace what is divine it it's not just running a controlling america
[3:23:28.440 --> 3:23:34.440]  or or overrunning america that's one of their goals but that that's on the way to overrunning god
[3:23:35.400 --> 3:23:40.840]  now let me share something with you there was a book written a few years ago called proof of heaven
[3:23:41.480 --> 3:23:49.800]  by a neurosurgeon his name is eban alexander and eban alexander was a skeptic he was a neurosurgeon
[3:23:49.800 --> 3:23:55.720]  trained in conventional medicine trained as a scientist obviously and he didn't believe in god
[3:23:55.720 --> 3:24:01.000]  he didn't believe in anything that that smacked of religion he wasn't interested in any of that he
[3:24:01.000 --> 3:24:06.520]  just wanted to live on this earth and and he thought that there was no life after death and so
[3:24:07.080 --> 3:24:11.640]  like most people on the left he was really an atheist who thought there would be no repercussions
[3:24:11.640 --> 3:24:18.840]  for his actions well he suffered a very extreme infection of his brain that actually killed him
[3:24:18.840 --> 3:24:23.880]  he died in the hospital due to this brain infection it was the most severe infection that
[3:24:23.880 --> 3:24:33.320]  many doctors had ever seen and he spent several days in a coma followed by actual death and during
[3:24:33.320 --> 3:24:41.960]  this time he experienced what he describes as proof of heaven he experienced both hell and heaven
[3:24:41.960 --> 3:24:49.800]  he experienced a timeless torture of hell as if he was existing in hell for infinity it was
[3:24:49.800 --> 3:24:56.360]  timeless he said there was no experience of the flow of time and then out of that he was saved by
[3:24:56.360 --> 3:25:03.320]  actual god as he describes it and he felt a tremendous love and acceptance and he he felt
[3:25:03.320 --> 3:25:08.360]  and and sensed more intense emotions in a sense of reality and consciousness than he had ever
[3:25:08.360 --> 3:25:15.320]  experienced in his entire life during this time his brain was not functioning he was brain dead
[3:25:15.320 --> 3:25:19.000]  and so all those theories that say oh no these are just artifacts of neurology
[3:25:19.000 --> 3:25:26.440]  those are false this man even alexander experienced actual hell and then heaven
[3:25:26.440 --> 3:25:31.640]  and the reason i mentioned this is because when he came back to life he was actually saved by god
[3:25:31.640 --> 3:25:37.400]  he was actually brought back into his body somehow he woke up from this his infection was healed
[3:25:37.400 --> 3:25:43.720]  and he lived to write this book and what he said in this book is very important is that earth
[3:25:43.720 --> 3:25:51.560]  is a battlefield for a cosmic spiritual battle and there is a higher concentration of evil
[3:25:52.120 --> 3:25:58.840]  on earth than at any other point in the entire universe he said that the universe is a place
[3:25:58.840 --> 3:26:05.240]  of love and a place of well what you might call liberty that that's my term not his but a place
[3:26:05.240 --> 3:26:09.800]  of love a place of divinity throughout the entire cosmos and yet there's this one place
[3:26:09.800 --> 3:26:16.520]  which is earth where what he described as as hellish satan is trying to take over
[3:26:17.480 --> 3:26:24.360]  you and i happen to be on this battlefield and so don't be surprised when there is so much evil
[3:26:24.360 --> 3:26:31.160]  that is attempting to assert power and attempting to to steal power away from those who are good
[3:26:31.160 --> 3:26:37.240]  don't be surprised when evil gains a foothold or when so many people who maybe used to be reasonable
[3:26:37.240 --> 3:26:46.440]  people are literally infected or infested with demonic forces because earth is a battlefield of
[3:26:46.440 --> 3:26:52.680]  you know in scripture it's called you know fallen angels it is a battlefield there's an epic cosmic
[3:26:52.680 --> 3:26:58.200]  battle between evil and good taking place here it's not a metaphor it's not just some ancient
[3:26:58.200 --> 3:27:04.520]  scripture that didn't happen this is real and it's happening right now and the effects of what we're
[3:27:04.520 --> 3:27:11.880]  seeing with these elections with the push for the genital mutilation of children via transgenderism
[3:27:11.880 --> 3:27:19.400]  indoctrination the push for the murder of late term babies who are about to be born all of these
[3:27:19.400 --> 3:27:28.680]  things are extensions of true satanism and true evil and it is here and it surrounds us it's
[3:27:28.680 --> 3:27:33.960]  everywhere in society and when you see what these democrats are pushing you know it is an extension
[3:27:33.960 --> 3:27:39.880]  of pure evil i'm just here to tell you today and in the upcoming segments i'm going to give you
[3:27:39.880 --> 3:27:44.440]  some things what what we can do to fight this evil by the way because it's more than just praying
[3:27:44.440 --> 3:27:49.880]  we can we must pray but we must also do other things as well god wants you to do certain
[3:27:49.880 --> 3:27:55.080]  things to empower yourself otherwise we wouldn't have free will so i'll talk about that but i
[3:27:55.080 --> 3:28:00.920]  want you to understand that at a very deep level at a very real level we are in a spiritual battle
[3:28:00.920 --> 3:28:06.680]  that has been taking place for thousands of years and will continue to take place for thousands of
[3:28:06.680 --> 3:28:14.680]  years beyond our short lives and that while we are here in these human lives with divine spirit
[3:28:15.240 --> 3:28:22.760]  you know body mind and soul it is our job to fight against evil and to defend and protect
[3:28:23.560 --> 3:28:30.600]  the divine and to serve frankly life and god that's what our mission is here that's what
[3:28:30.600 --> 3:28:36.760]  we are doing and we must never lose that perspective of how important it is what we are doing so
[3:28:36.760 --> 3:28:41.240]  when we come back i'll share more specific details about how we can win this fight
[3:28:41.240 --> 3:28:49.080]  against evil and protect our world for those who are willing to to live life to its fullest we'll

[3:33:14.200 --> 3:33:24.920]  all right for this segment i'd like to ask for callers i don't normally do this but because
[3:33:24.920 --> 3:33:29.880]  of what's happening today the level of spiritual awareness i'd like to invite you to call in
[3:33:29.880 --> 3:33:37.480]  if you've got a real event or something that happened to you where where you were touched
[3:33:37.480 --> 3:33:43.560]  by divine inspiration pertaining to this battle that's happening this spiritual war that's happening
[3:33:43.560 --> 3:33:49.720]  how did you wake up how were you touched by god how did you come to expand your consciousness the
[3:33:49.720 --> 3:33:59.320]  phone number is 877-789 alex or 877-789-2539 is what that comes out to so we'll take those calls
[3:33:59.320 --> 3:34:07.080]  here in it in a few minutes until we get to those calls i want to remind you that part of this war
[3:34:07.080 --> 3:34:15.880]  on humanity involves actual depopulation actual eugenics and the mass poisoning of human beings
[3:34:15.880 --> 3:34:20.920]  and so this mass poisoning is taking place through multiple vectors and i've actually
[3:34:20.920 --> 3:34:27.080]  done a number of lectures on this over the years but just to summarize my findings the united nations
[3:34:27.080 --> 3:34:35.720]  is key to this the united nations spiked vaccines given to women in kenya with infertility chemicals
[3:34:35.720 --> 3:34:41.480]  to cause spontaneous abortions and of course the long-term infertility this was actually
[3:34:41.480 --> 3:34:46.600]  discovered by the kenyan a council of bishops i believe that's their name they they're their
[3:34:46.600 --> 3:34:53.560]  bishops who are pro-vaccine they go around giving vaccines to women in kenya well women and men both
[3:34:53.560 --> 3:34:57.960]  but they found that as they were given these vaccines to women all these women would lose their
[3:34:57.960 --> 3:35:02.040]  their babies or they would not be able to get pregnant for an extended period of time so they
[3:35:02.040 --> 3:35:07.960]  sent the vaccines to four different laboratories and they found confirmed in those labs that these
[3:35:07.960 --> 3:35:15.000]  vaccines which are un approved vaccines had been spiked with infertility chemicals so in africa
[3:35:15.000 --> 3:35:22.200]  today there is a globalist effort to kill off black people this is eugenics and it is globalist
[3:35:22.200 --> 3:35:27.960]  run it's approved by the united nations it's just an extension it's just really a demonstration of
[3:35:27.960 --> 3:35:35.000]  the kind of evil that i that i mentioned is rising in the last hour this evil that wants to destroy
[3:35:35.000 --> 3:35:43.320]  humanity and they are specifically targeting not only the women in kenya but also men in in the
[3:35:43.320 --> 3:35:51.800]  entire african continent i i have to remind you back in 1971 the science advisor to richard nixon
[3:35:51.800 --> 3:35:58.680]  at the time was quoted by the new york times saying that they wanted to put infertility chemicals
[3:35:58.680 --> 3:36:05.080]  into the food supply exported from the united states that would be consumed by africans and the idea
[3:36:05.080 --> 3:36:12.840]  was at that time to spike all the food in developing nations to collapse their populations and
[3:36:12.840 --> 3:36:19.240]  carry out mass eugenics programs now what has happened since then though in addition to the
[3:36:19.240 --> 3:36:23.240]  eugenics that's taking place in africa the united nations is now calling for third world
[3:36:23.240 --> 3:36:27.960]  nations to invade first world nations and you may say well wait a minute i thought they wanted to
[3:36:27.960 --> 3:36:35.160]  kill third world nation people well they did but now they understand that third world nation migrants
[3:36:35.160 --> 3:36:40.520]  can become the conquerors to overrun sovereign nations like the united states that are resisting
[3:36:40.520 --> 3:36:48.200]  globalist control so the real plan here is to use third world nation migrants to invade first world
[3:36:48.200 --> 3:36:56.680]  nations and then unleash a global killer which of course will be an outbreak of infectious disease
[3:36:56.680 --> 3:37:03.560]  ebola or super bugs such as mercer or others that are being of course developed in laboratories
[3:37:03.560 --> 3:37:08.920]  in the united nations and elsewhere around the world they do not want humanity to survive
[3:37:10.040 --> 3:37:14.600]  they want to kill you and some of the vectors that they're using to weaken your minds and weaken
[3:37:14.600 --> 3:37:24.360]  your bodies in order to control you include 5g this is of course an electromagnetic saturation
[3:37:24.360 --> 3:37:30.600]  of the human nervous system with cancer causing essentially ionizing radiation they're also
[3:37:30.600 --> 3:37:36.760]  using the chemical route so if you want to know whether fluoride works to keep people dumbed down
[3:37:36.760 --> 3:37:42.120]  just look at the midterm elections there look half of america it seems voted for their own
[3:37:42.120 --> 3:37:47.560]  enslavement and financial demise fluoride which is especially prevalent in the cities
[3:37:48.600 --> 3:37:53.560]  has that effect it is turning people against themselves is turning humanity into a suicide
[3:37:53.560 --> 3:37:59.720]  cult and you you see this effect most prominently in democrat areas which happen to be urban areas
[3:37:59.720 --> 3:38:04.760]  where there is more fluoride dripped into the water supply in addition the food supply is
[3:38:04.760 --> 3:38:10.200]  systematically and deliberately poisoned with pesticides herbicides and other chemicals
[3:38:10.200 --> 3:38:14.040]  and we just published a story today on natural news it talks about how pesticides have been
[3:38:14.040 --> 3:38:20.600]  proven to cause autism when they're consumed by expectant mothers so the food supply is poison
[3:38:20.600 --> 3:38:26.920]  that is a scientific fact there is no debate the food supply is poison the food supply causes
[3:38:26.920 --> 3:38:33.160]  infertility causes mutations causes birth defects and this is what humanity is eating
[3:38:33.160 --> 3:38:40.680]  and feeding upon by design it's not an accident it is by design so with that said i want to
[3:38:41.320 --> 3:38:46.520]  take a few calls now i i don't have the caller board here since i'm joining remote so guys who
[3:38:46.520 --> 3:38:50.120]  are running the board just go ahead and give me a name and a caller and we'll take that call
[3:38:50.840 --> 3:38:57.160]  uh jeb in canada did i get that right uh jeff i'm sorry jeff in canada go ahead you're live
[3:38:57.160 --> 3:39:04.520]  with mike adams go ahead hey mike uh thanks for taking my call yeah i i really uh think
[3:39:04.520 --> 3:39:10.360]  i think the uh show today is completely on target and i just want to bring up a point
[3:39:11.400 --> 3:39:19.480]  you know with all the the multi-layered attack that uh we've been under from the globalist and
[3:39:19.480 --> 3:39:25.720]  i believe from from the beginning of the fall of man there's always been one ultimate target of
[3:39:25.720 --> 3:39:36.680]  the globalist and that is the person of jesus christ the the attack has always been um layering up to
[3:39:36.680 --> 3:39:41.880]  that in the elimination of christ because christ is the operating system of the earth according to
[3:39:41.880 --> 3:39:49.720]  the bible which i believe and they're doing everything they can to destroy us but the ultimate
[3:39:49.720 --> 3:39:57.160]  uh destruction as we know as christians is the destruction of the soul and i really believe
[3:39:57.160 --> 3:40:06.920]  that uh the watering down of the gospel what the gospel actually state is uh sort of under
[3:40:06.920 --> 3:40:14.920]  the radar but it's it's shown um in the weakness of the church and the believers just to simply
[3:40:14.920 --> 3:40:22.360]  believe what who god is and what he's done for all humanity you're exactly right on you're right on
[3:40:22.360 --> 3:40:27.720]  track jeff uh my comment there is yes so so many of the churches have been taken over by globalists
[3:40:28.280 --> 3:40:34.040]  and the attack on christ and the attack on christianity has accelerated like crazy under the
[3:40:34.040 --> 3:40:41.000]  democrats uh but let me ask you before i let you go has has anything appeared to you or occurred to
[3:40:41.000 --> 3:40:47.160]  you uh that things are going to change or do you think we're going to just keep having to defend
[3:40:47.160 --> 3:40:55.160]  ourselves against these spiritual assaults well i think first off people who are are open to christ
[3:40:55.160 --> 3:41:02.760]  or who have confessed christ we we really need to experience uh the reformation even beyond
[3:41:02.760 --> 3:41:08.840]  reformation is restoration to the original plan of god god loves us and he just simply asked us to
[3:41:08.840 --> 3:41:18.280]  believe who he is and to operate within him and we i i believe we need a real reformation to
[3:41:18.920 --> 3:41:26.600]  jesus christ christ died for the sins of all people and that debt has been paid that was a
[3:41:26.600 --> 3:41:31.480]  contract between the father and the son and that is finished and god just simply asked us to believe
[3:41:31.480 --> 3:41:37.880]  it it's not a ladder to get to god it's a simple belief in that god loves us and he cares for us
[3:41:37.880 --> 3:41:44.200]  and he has an inheritance and identity and value for us so what i would say is everybody has to
[3:41:45.320 --> 3:41:48.840]  you know have their due face to face with jesus because you're going to face them one way or
[3:41:48.840 --> 3:41:54.680]  another well well said uh i i sorry to interrupt but i have a comment on that thank you for the
[3:41:54.680 --> 3:42:00.280]  call jeff well said i i jokingly wrote this morning that if if democrats actually weren't
[3:42:00.280 --> 3:42:05.320]  atheist if they did believe in god they would pray to god and say dear god please save me from
[3:42:05.320 --> 3:42:11.800]  the consequences of my own actions because what they're setting into motion is hell on earth that's
[3:42:11.800 --> 3:42:17.080]  what democrats are creating and yet they somehow think that they will not have to to face the
[3:42:17.080 --> 3:42:23.320]  repercussions of what they have wrought and yet they will because as you said jeff they will face
[3:42:23.320 --> 3:42:30.280]  god they will face judgment for their actions there is a human soul that that persists beyond this
[3:42:30.280 --> 3:42:36.760]  life uh that survives this life and that soul will have a lot to answer for a lot of people
[3:42:36.760 --> 3:42:42.280]  our job is to make sure that we serve higher purpose while we are here we'll be right back
[3:42:42.280 --> 3:42:46.360]  with more listen to the alice jones show mike adams filling in we'll be right back
[3:42:53.000 --> 3:42:57.400]  the globalists know that if they suppress the good halogen and pump the environment full of
[3:42:57.400 --> 3:43:02.840]  the bad halogens fluoride chlorine bromide you name it that it lowers iq it literally
[3:43:03.400 --> 3:43:08.040]  dumps the population down and on our quest to bring our listeners and viewers the best
[3:43:08.040 --> 3:43:14.120]  iodine in the world we've gone through two permutations first seaweed based iodine that was
[3:43:14.120 --> 3:43:18.520]  pretty good but hard to source and the globalists tried to block us getting a supply of it so we
[3:43:18.520 --> 3:43:24.840]  discovered deep earth crystals a pure nascent iodine and brought ux2 that's been incredible now
[3:43:24.840 --> 3:43:29.800]  due to the establishment trying to block that we did more research and secured more of the deep
[3:43:29.800 --> 3:43:35.000]  earth crystals of nascent iodine but chemists scientists and others showed us the research
[3:43:35.000 --> 3:43:41.800]  that by combining it with three other compounds two forms of iodine and vitamin c it super charges it
[3:43:41.800 --> 3:43:47.560]  and makes it even more bio available ladies and gentlemen you want to research it you want to
[3:43:47.560 --> 3:43:53.960]  see it it's an incredible discovery x3 now available at enforce life dot com our grandparents

[3:47:12.520 --> 3:47:22.680]  it's mike adams you're listening to the alex jones show uh prepare to be really blown away by the
[3:47:22.680 --> 3:47:26.600]  information i'm going to reveal in this segment these are some practical solutions to protect
[3:47:26.600 --> 3:47:32.200]  your body mind and spirit from the spiritual assault that's targeting all humanity right now
[3:47:32.760 --> 3:47:39.240]  and it is that spiritual assault that is causing us to see the symptoms of that the the demonization
[3:47:39.240 --> 3:47:45.400]  of society the demon crats trying to gain power through uh thievery and and cheating and so on
[3:47:46.680 --> 3:47:52.040]  as a scientist you know i run a lab i'm i'm a published scientist i know the role of nutrition
[3:47:52.680 --> 3:47:56.840]  in protecting your mind but i'm gonna i'm gonna go beyond nutrition science here and mention a
[3:47:56.840 --> 3:48:04.680]  couple things uh but we'll start with that the basics are your brain can be protected by a vast
[3:48:04.680 --> 3:48:11.640]  array of nutrients and these nutrients include curcumin in turmeric for example they include
[3:48:11.640 --> 3:48:16.280]  nutrients that are found in green tea they include nutrients that are found in medicinal
[3:48:16.280 --> 3:48:23.320]  mushrooms or chinese medicine and western herbs and and many others and uh even though i'm not here
[3:48:23.320 --> 3:48:28.520]  to to to plug alex's products i don't have any financial ties to alex's products but iodine
[3:48:28.520 --> 3:48:35.080]  has something about it that you may have never known iodine not only is it a trace element but
[3:48:35.080 --> 3:48:41.800]  did you know that the atomic mass of iodine 127 is a prime number which is considered a cosmic
[3:48:41.800 --> 3:48:47.880]  number some people believe and this isn't really a scientific uh sentence here but but many people
[3:48:47.880 --> 3:48:54.200]  believe from a spiritual point of view that god speaks to us through mathematics and specifically
[3:48:54.200 --> 3:49:01.000]  prime numbers and if you go back into you know the the history of mathematics you find a lot of
[3:49:01.000 --> 3:49:07.160]  a lot of cases where there were christian christians who were scientists who believed in the power of
[3:49:07.160 --> 3:49:11.240]  prime numbers because they were unique numbers i know this is a fascinating discussion but
[3:49:12.440 --> 3:49:20.280]  iodine is believed by many people in uh in nutrition and consciousness to actually connect
[3:49:20.280 --> 3:49:25.720]  uh your your brain to consciousness and again i understand this is not a scientific statement
[3:49:25.720 --> 3:49:30.680]  here but something for you to explore just just look into this there's a consciousness element
[3:49:31.560 --> 3:49:38.840]  that is iodine and it happens to be the atomic mass of 127 which is a prime number it's also two
[3:49:38.840 --> 3:49:45.480]  to the power of seven minus one by the way with seven uh being of course a a biblical scripture
[3:49:45.480 --> 3:49:50.840]  number you know the seven seven signs and seven bells and so on so that's fascinating two to the
[3:49:50.840 --> 3:49:57.640]  power of seven uh two being a binary so a binary a binary number to the power of seven minus one
[3:49:57.640 --> 3:50:04.040]  is 127 it's also interesting from a scientific point of view that iodine is not a polyatomic
[3:50:04.040 --> 3:50:11.240]  element but what i mean is it doesn't exist in its natural form in any other mass other than 127
[3:50:11.240 --> 3:50:16.600]  and now it can exist in 131 which is a radioisotope but that's not normal that's not
[3:50:17.160 --> 3:50:22.520]  a naturally occurring isotope there are many metals such as lead that naturally occur in
[3:50:22.520 --> 3:50:31.080]  other atomic masses such lead for example 206 208 mercury is both it's 200 201 and 202
[3:50:31.080 --> 3:50:35.960]  simultaneously those are called polyatomic elements but iodine is not that way iodine is
[3:50:35.960 --> 3:50:43.320]  always at 127 and if you look at atoms and atomic structure you understand that atoms are harmonics
[3:50:44.040 --> 3:50:47.960]  and i'm not going to get too much in depth here but something for you to explore
[3:50:47.960 --> 3:50:54.760]  the the harmonics of iodine have something very very unique about them that of course it's unique
[3:50:54.760 --> 3:50:59.320]  not only from a scientific perspective on the table of elements but it's also very rare to have
[3:50:59.320 --> 3:51:05.880]  something that is nutritionally used to protect cognitive function and to protect neurology
[3:51:06.760 --> 3:51:13.640]  that is also a prime number atomic mass so do with that what you will just sharing some interesting
[3:51:13.640 --> 3:51:18.760]  tidbits with you here but explore that you're going to find some interesting things about iodine and
[3:51:18.760 --> 3:51:24.920]  i'm not making any specific claims about iodine but nutrition in general is something that protects
[3:51:24.920 --> 3:51:30.360]  your mind and protects your brain and if you don't have good nutrition then you're subject to the
[3:51:30.360 --> 3:51:36.440]  mass poisoning of pesticides and fluoride and all the other chemicals the the toxic fragrance
[3:51:36.440 --> 3:51:41.320]  chemicals that people have in their perfumes and their laundry detergents and dryer sheets
[3:51:41.320 --> 3:51:46.280]  and so on and if i could summarize what i'm trying to say here then i'll i'll go to some calls it is
[3:51:47.000 --> 3:51:52.280]  people please i beg of you i pray for you stop poisoning yourself stop poisoning yourself
[3:51:52.280 --> 3:51:57.640]  with toxic chemicals and instead take in the substances that are going to not only protect
[3:51:57.640 --> 3:52:04.760]  you but even can help enlighten you and that's no joke if you look in the bible and you look at
[3:52:04.760 --> 3:52:10.040]  even world religions people around the world who were the the gurus or the saints or the religious
[3:52:10.040 --> 3:52:16.520]  leaders they would get away from what was processed food of the day they would go out into nature they
[3:52:16.520 --> 3:52:22.440]  would sometimes fast they would drink clean water they would eat herbs they would eat the roots they
[3:52:22.440 --> 3:52:27.080]  would take the natural products like the turmeric roots or the the onions in the ground they would
[3:52:27.080 --> 3:52:32.440]  eat the herbs and then they would they would have an epiphany because they're having such clarity in
[3:52:32.440 --> 3:52:38.520]  that moment because suddenly they're not polluted the brains aren't intoxicated literally and yet
[3:52:38.520 --> 3:52:46.040]  society today is full of so much poison that by comparison a biblical diet in that day would
[3:52:46.040 --> 3:52:53.240]  now be considered all organic what people ate in biblical times was all organic and yet today
[3:52:53.240 --> 3:52:58.680]  you see people filing in and out of churches and their health is in very bad shape they're eating
[3:52:58.680 --> 3:53:03.080]  junk food sometimes the church is putting on an event and serving them donuts i mean give me a
[3:53:03.080 --> 3:53:08.440]  break that's not that's not in alignment with scripture that's not in alignment with god
[3:53:08.440 --> 3:53:14.360]  so stop poisoning your body and start nourishing your body and you will find effects that go beyond
[3:53:14.360 --> 3:53:20.200]  the mere physical they go to the spiritual and yes i'm i'm i'm not telling you everything i
[3:53:20.200 --> 3:53:25.080]  know on the subject i'm just kind of giving you enough of a tease that you will do some more
[3:53:25.080 --> 3:53:29.560]  research yourself and find out i'm not i'm not even talking about psychedelic drugs or anything
[3:53:29.560 --> 3:53:35.800]  like that i'm just talking about straight up nutrition phytonutrients from plants now i want
[3:53:35.800 --> 3:53:41.240]  to go to some calls here we've got a few more callers lined up let's go to brian in illinois
[3:53:41.240 --> 3:53:47.240]  brian you're live with mike adams thank you for your patience as i unveiled all that go ahead
[3:53:47.240 --> 3:53:52.440]  what's what's your comment or question yeah my um my comment is that you are extremely
[3:53:52.440 --> 3:53:57.480]  right about our nutrition and what we need to put in our bodies and the one thing that i'm seeing
[3:53:57.480 --> 3:54:03.800]  right now as far as um things happening spiritually i realized that the evil forces want to pollute
[3:54:03.800 --> 3:54:09.240]  our food so they can dumb us down and then destroy us and here's some here's a fun thing i find out
[3:54:09.240 --> 3:54:16.440]  too in illinois the healthy food is expensive the reason why people are not able to eat the
[3:54:16.440 --> 3:54:21.160]  healthy food that's in health's food stores or grow it is most of the time well they can grow
[3:54:21.160 --> 3:54:24.840]  it but it's just like they're in different states like it's winter it's summer in different states
[3:54:24.840 --> 3:54:29.080]  but there are a lot of weather patterns due to chemtrails too but the reason why we're not
[3:54:29.080 --> 3:54:34.520]  able to buy this because we can't afford it that's why we save our money to buy these organic
[3:54:34.520 --> 3:54:39.240]  ingredients but we have to grow it right and the conventional foods are in essence subsidized by
[3:54:39.240 --> 3:54:44.680]  the government so non-organic corn and corn syrup and all that is is paid for in part by
[3:54:44.680 --> 3:54:51.080]  taxpayers so so they're they're punishing us for wanting to eat organic right yeah basically man
[3:54:51.080 --> 3:54:56.760]  because honestly um there were people who were there are not a lot of health stores in illinois
[3:54:56.760 --> 3:55:02.360]  there are very few there and basically like secluded towns like homewood and park forest
[3:55:02.360 --> 3:55:07.640]  and i have to you know basically take take the buses to get down there and yeah there's not a
[3:55:07.640 --> 3:55:11.800]  lot of them because and most and most of the grocery stores like walmart and i'm exposing them
[3:55:11.800 --> 3:55:17.160]  walmart target jewel oscoe they're selling stuff with junk food we see a lot of gluten free but
[3:55:17.160 --> 3:55:24.680]  that's just not enough right yeah actually a lot of a lot of gluten free contains glyphosate by the
[3:55:24.680 --> 3:55:28.200]  way uh but you're you're right on point there brine i appreciate your call i'm going to go to
[3:55:28.200 --> 3:55:32.360]  another caller let's get some more comments in before we close out this time let's go to lauren
[3:55:32.360 --> 3:55:40.600]  in nevada if i do i have that name right lauren yes hi mike hi there can you can you hear me
[3:55:41.240 --> 3:55:46.680]  yeah you're you're you're good go ahead it's it's an honor to speak with you i i'm a published
[3:55:46.680 --> 3:55:53.560]  author i haven't published since the 90s however but to make to make a very long story short my
[3:55:53.560 --> 3:55:59.240]  son was born in 1989 and there was no internet or any of that information out but the holy spirit
[3:55:59.240 --> 3:56:06.200]  i believe told me to give my son only great earth baby food which is organic and i only
[3:56:06.200 --> 3:56:12.120]  would allow him things that were organic all his growing up we made all his cereal we made all his
[3:56:12.120 --> 3:56:21.080]  food um everything no no nothing processed and i i also have uh was diagnosed i lived in northern
[3:56:21.080 --> 3:56:28.360]  california uh in the emerald triangle and um which is my subject i wanted to ask you about marijuana
[3:56:28.360 --> 3:56:35.560]  and manzano but i went to utah got on prescription drugs to do it for my family for one year i said
[3:56:35.560 --> 3:56:42.360]  i will do this for one year because they did not believe that marijuana would help me and so i did
[3:56:42.360 --> 3:56:48.520]  that and i went to colorado two years later and i got off everything i need your question real quick
[3:56:48.520 --> 3:56:53.800]  lauren we're about to run out of time okay my question is what do you think about manzanto
[3:56:53.800 --> 3:57:00.840]  and marijuana and and the st louis st louis they have they've made a strain of marijuana well of
[3:57:00.840 --> 3:57:07.320]  course mon mon satan uh is very clear what what they represent and the evil that they are but
[3:57:07.320 --> 3:57:13.880]  marijuana of course is a is a natural plant and a healing plant uh marijuana cannabis should be
[3:57:13.880 --> 3:57:18.520]  decentralized and made available to everyone everyone should be able to grow it from additional
[3:57:18.520 --> 3:57:24.040]  purposes we don't want to be monopolized by evil corporations that's my view on cannabis
[3:57:24.040 --> 3:57:30.120]  that plant is here for a purpose and it's compatible with the with human biology so
[3:57:30.120 --> 3:57:34.920]  we need to decriminalize cannabis and we need to take our power back from evil corporations
[3:57:35.800 --> 3:57:40.600]  thank you all for watching today i bless you all prayers i'll join you again in another episode
