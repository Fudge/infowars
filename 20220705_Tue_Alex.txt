[00:00.000 --> 00:29.000]  It's time for humanity to stand up, and the info war is over.
[00:29.000 --> 00:36.000]  I don't know what's going to happen at the end of this, but you want to fight, you better believe, you got one!
[00:36.000 --> 00:54.000]  From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[00:54.000 --> 01:08.000]  While 80% of the world's population continues on with oil and gas, the United States and a small handful of western nations have decided to go green, even if it kills everyone.
[01:08.000 --> 01:21.000]  They have already admitted that the disruptive economic burden this will cause is exactly the sort of pressure required to inspire the innovation needed to make it all work someday.
[01:21.000 --> 01:26.000]  Because that's the plan, there are no viable solutions to replace oil and gas.
[01:26.000 --> 01:37.000]  So the sooner we can figure it out, the sooner we can stop the endless rise of inflation, starvation, and death that will obviously result from shutting off our energy taps.
[01:37.000 --> 01:44.000]  And a new company has already appeared, albeit with a bizarre solution to our problems.
[01:44.000 --> 01:55.000]  A massive meat rendering facility is set to break ground next year in Rapid City, South Dakota, and be completed by 2026.
[01:55.000 --> 02:05.000]  With the ordinary name the Western Legacy Development Corporation, one might never guess how innovative this company actually is.
[02:05.000 --> 02:21.000]  The Western Legacy Development Corporation will process cattle and bison completely with robotics and artificial intelligence, including new laser technology air knives that use a high velocity airstream to de-hide the animals.
[02:21.000 --> 02:33.000]  The Western Legacy Development Corporation is building a massive one million square foot meat factory that will be operating at levels as high as 8,000 cattle per day.
[02:33.000 --> 02:43.000]  Now, one might ask, what about all this social engineering to stop eating real beef and get used to eating lab grown meat and bugs?
[02:43.000 --> 02:47.000]  Aren't we being told that cow farts are bad for the environment?
[02:47.000 --> 02:57.000]  Well, as it turns out, the Western Legacy Development Corporation isn't necessarily going to be processing 3 million cattle per year for food.
[02:57.000 --> 03:10.000]  The Western Legacy Development Corporation will be collecting animal fat to be used as feed and fuel, a biofuel that they will use to power their very own one million square foot facility.
[03:10.000 --> 03:12.000]  Now, how green is that?
[03:12.000 --> 03:19.000]  Well, maybe not small farm grass fed level green, but still it's pretty green.
[03:19.000 --> 03:27.000]  Rapid City is a small town and many residents are asking, where will they get 8,000 cattle a day? And where will they keep them?
[03:27.000 --> 03:35.000]  And where will they get 2,500 employees, which is 3% of their population? And where will they house them?
[03:35.000 --> 03:50.000]  These questions weren't really answered, but we do know that they plan to have a thriving rail system that will be offloading thousands of cattle each and every day, directly into the AI robot laser slaughterhouse for immediate processing.
[03:50.000 --> 03:53.000]  So they won't need to store the cattle anywhere.
[03:53.000 --> 04:08.000]  Now, while this may sound like some sort of crazy economist's solution to cleaning up a mass murder, or even some kind of silent green scenario where the government is chopping up people in a factory for food, and in this case, energy.
[04:08.000 --> 04:12.000]  Silent green is people!
[04:12.000 --> 04:25.000]  We are told that it's all for the environment, so I'm sure it's all good. And hey, at least we won't be burning any more oil, like the rest of the world. And don't worry, trust the science.
[04:25.000 --> 04:28.000]  Russia. Russia, Russia, Russia.
[04:28.000 --> 04:41.000]  And remember the plan. Once we really start suffering, someone will eventually think of a solution. And if not, at least we were willing to die for a criminal government run by pedophiles.
[04:41.000 --> 04:45.000]  Reporting for InfoWars, this is Greg Rees.
[04:45.000 --> 05:01.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, it is Tuesday, July 5th, 2022. I'm your host Alex Jones. In the command seat in the ATX, stay with us. InfoWars.com, tomorrow's news. Today, today, today.
[05:01.000 --> 05:20.000]  The July 4th, 2022 Super Sale is live and only running for one week exclusively at infowarstore.com. Double Patriot points, and 40 to 75% off. All items are at least 40% off, and some of our best sellers are 75% off.
[05:20.000 --> 05:29.000]  This is the biggest sale yet of the year. Some of these products were selling at below cost. You've got to move them out of the warehouse and be able to continue to stay on the air.
[05:29.000 --> 05:39.000]  Please take action and declare independence from the New World Order by keeping the tip of the spear on air and getting great products at infowarsstore.com.
[05:39.000 --> 05:47.000]  I want to thank you all this July 4th for your continued fight for America, and I would encourage you to join the fight even harder now, because we're so close to winning.
[05:47.000 --> 06:00.000]  InfoWars.com and celebrate July 4th, 1776, Part 2 against the New World Order, because the answer to 1984 is 1776.
[06:17.000 --> 06:46.000]  This is the shooting in Ireland. Illinois on July 4th.
[06:46.000 --> 07:04.000]  And a man fitting the almost identical description as all the other mass shooters has now been caught by the police today after a chase.
[07:04.000 --> 07:18.000]  This is the world we live in, ladies and gentlemen. 53 dead people last week in a tractor trailer outside San Antonio locked in there to die by the human smugglers because their families hadn't paid the second half of the money.
[07:18.000 --> 07:27.000]  That will just go away in the wash. No one's going to blame 18-wheelers. No one's going to blame tractor trailers that could be used as cages to kill people in the heat.
[07:27.000 --> 07:37.000]  They're used every week by the coyotes, by the human smugglers to do that. You wouldn't blame the tractor trailer. You wouldn't blame the 18-wheeler.
[07:37.000 --> 07:45.000]  You wouldn't blame the machine. You'd blame the psychotic evil of someone that would do something like that.
[07:45.000 --> 08:00.000]  In fact, I saw a headline from the UN itself yesterday. I forgot to send it to the crew. I'm going to ask the crew to grab it.
[08:00.000 --> 08:15.000]  They're crossing in the world, and they give us statistics. In fact, it's twice as dangerous as the next most dangerous border crossing, and that's into Arizona. And it goes on from there.
[08:15.000 --> 08:28.000]  Tens of thousands dead a year on both sides, not even a radar blip. But we have less than 150 people killed in mass shootings a year, still way too many.
[08:28.000 --> 08:47.000]  We just had six killed in Illinois, 21 killed in Uvaldi, and the media will hype the hell out of it, and there will be more copycats, mentally ill, highly suggestible individuals on psychotropic.
[08:47.000 --> 09:10.000]  The individual who is reportedly the shooter, Bobby Cremo, had a YouTube channel. It was taken down last night. I watched all 26 videos on it yesterday.
[09:10.000 --> 09:20.000]  You talk about depressing and scary, I sent links to it to my producers by the time they got here at 7am this morning. They'd all been deleted, but they were able to find some of them.
[09:20.000 --> 09:35.000]  But let me tell you what's on them. Extremely haunting. I watched every one of them. He did animations about mass shooting at schools, complete with crying and screaming in blood.
[09:35.000 --> 10:00.000]  He made music videos about the same thing. He even got into the school that he went to years ago and shot a music video inside of it and later dressed up like paramilitary with a military helmet and rifle and described what he was going to do.
[10:00.000 --> 10:17.000]  They have red flag laws already in place in Illinois, and just like Uvaldi, and just like Colorado with Harrison Clybold and Columbine, and just like Sandy Hook, New Haven, Connecticut, and just like every single one of them.
[10:17.000 --> 10:43.000]  It's an incel into the occult, obsessed with shoot-em-up games, who said in the music videos that he was under mind control and just wanted to sleep and was under someone else's control, and that he didn't want to do what he was going to do, but that he had to.
[10:43.000 --> 10:57.000]  Even more dramatic, even more open than the shooter in Florida at Parkland a few years ago who was called in the school, the school shooter.
[10:57.000 --> 11:08.000]  And he was kicked out of school for stealing and making threats when he rode his bicycle to the school and shot the people inside. And again, the police stood down.
[11:08.000 --> 11:24.000]  The police did not stand down. In Illinois yesterday, they charged him, and they did not stand down with the shooter in Philadelphia at a July 4th event, and two of the officers were shot, but they were able to stop him.
[11:24.000 --> 11:45.000]  So good for the police in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, and good for the police in Highland Park, Illinois. They did not act in disgraceful, disgusting fashion like the police in Florida and Texas.
[11:45.000 --> 11:59.000]  But if I had to create an image of a demonic slave, an entity, a human totally taken over by evil, Bobby Cremio would be it.
[11:59.000 --> 12:07.000]  Now, we have at least five of the videos we were able to find. I watched over 20 of them last night, some repeatedly.
[12:07.000 --> 12:16.000]  And I should have called crew and had them download them then, but it was for the July and it was 8 o'clock at night by the time I started watching them. It was past 10 before I'd finished.
[12:16.000 --> 12:26.000]  And they did get some of the bad ones, but some of them they did not get. I'm sure somebody will dig them up, but I really don't want to subject you to this.
[12:26.000 --> 12:38.000]  I mean, very haunting. Some of the music is actually pretty, pretty good beats, but you hear total depression and total desperateness in this.
[12:38.000 --> 12:51.000]  So this is why we have guns is because with the collapse of civilization and the satanic takeover that's happening and the economic collapse that's accelerating and inflation.
[12:51.000 --> 12:58.000]  And the EBT cards still get money put on them, but it won't buy what people need to live. You're going to see.
[12:58.000 --> 13:05.000]  This Klaus Schwab says a much angrier world, which they're designing to bring down civilization. They're attacking the energy. They're attacking the food processing.
[13:05.000 --> 13:14.000]  They're attacking the borders. They're attacking the currency. They're attacking us at every level. This is the planned great reset to collapse civilization to build on its asses.
[13:14.000 --> 13:24.000]  Their new world order after a 90% depopulation operation.
[13:24.000 --> 13:32.000]  But he, the evidence is overwhelming. The left's trying to blame the right wing. The right wing is trying to blame the left wing.
[13:32.000 --> 13:48.000]  And I did a deep study, probably a four hour dive on this guy last night, two hours watching the sickening videos, the haunting videos of him music videos and his art videos and his animation pieces.
[13:48.000 --> 13:52.000]  Most of them about shooting up schools.
[13:52.000 --> 13:56.000]  And I can tell you that it's demonic.
[13:56.000 --> 14:07.000]  It's like all the other shootings of this nature. And it's 100% driven by seeing the mass shootings, the media and it being hyped up.
[14:07.000 --> 14:17.000]  And he even created music videos of himself after he did a mass shooting at a parade being killed by police and laying in a pool of blood.
[14:17.000 --> 14:30.000]  But what he wanted to have happen to him did not happen to him. He is now alive, captured by the police.
[14:30.000 --> 14:41.000]  And as this evil rises, especially in the blue cities, the system wants our guns so they can carry out the organized enslavement and extermination.
[14:41.000 --> 15:05.000]  As you've seen in Maoist China, Stalinists and Leninists, Russia, Hitler's Germany, Pol Potts Cambodia, Fidel Castro's Cuba, Hugo Chavez's, Venezuela and countless other nations where the public is disarmed and are absolutely at the mercy of the criminal governments.
[15:05.000 --> 15:11.000]  This individual, Bobby Cremio, is the definition of mind control.
[15:11.000 --> 15:25.000]  You also like to dress up wearing FBI agent outfits. And just like the white supremacist shooter followed the same MO in Buffalo, New York and was under constant contact with a retired federal agent,
[15:25.000 --> 15:36.000]  I will bet you my bottom dollar that this individual was under cultural mass mind control and probably directed mind control.
[15:36.000 --> 15:41.000]  And I told you the season of the mass shootings is coming.
[15:41.000 --> 15:47.000]  And you can expect more of this.
[15:47.000 --> 15:49.000]  Remember Tim McVeigh said he was under mind control.
[15:49.000 --> 16:00.000]  Peter Kosinski was under mind control. The Unabomber on record LA Times came out in court. This has mind control. M.K. Ultra CIA written all over it.
[16:19.000 --> 16:27.000]  This is the biggest sale yet of the year. Some of these products were selling at below cost. You've got to move them out of the warehouse and be able to continue to stay on the air.
[16:27.000 --> 16:38.000]  So please take action to declare independence from the New World Order by keeping the tip of the spear on air and getting great products at infowarstore.com.
[16:38.000 --> 16:45.000]  I want to thank you all this July 4th for your continued fight for America. And I would encourage you to join the fight even harder now because we're so close to winning.
[16:45.000 --> 16:52.000]  So please take action to declare independence from the New World Order by keeping the tip of the spear on air and getting great products at infowarstore.com.
[16:52.000 --> 17:00.000]  And celebrate July 4th, 1776, part two against the New World Order because the answer to 1984 is 1776.
[17:00.000 --> 17:14.000]  The National Suisse's new film 2000 Mules is the most important documentary in modern times because it proves how the deep state stole the 2020 election and how they're planning to steal future elections and complete our journey to basically being like Venezuela.
[17:14.000 --> 17:27.000]  Now it's great that it's online. It's great that millions watch online. But you need to have the high quality HD DVD in your library with the expanded extras so it can't be censored in the future and so you can show it to everyone you know.
[17:27.000 --> 17:45.000]  Go to infowarstore.com and get 2000 mules today and get it discounted up to 30% off when you get it with other documentary films like in-game blueprint for global enslavement, the seminal classic that predicted the great reset, and of course part one, part two, and now the new part three of COVID land.
[17:45.000 --> 17:56.000]  Get them separate, get them together, massively discounted at infowarstore.com. But everyone needs to have 2000 mules in their library so the globalists can't censor it.
[17:56.000 --> 17:59.000]  infowarstore.com to get 2000 mules today.
[18:05.000 --> 18:17.000]  I want to say Brain Force is great. I want to say Turbo Force is amazing. It is. But if you took it with fish oil, it's like the fish oil is it. The fish oil is better than it. And that's an example of what I'm talking about.
[18:17.000 --> 18:28.000]  Fish oil is liquid energy, brain, body, heart, the cleanest, the best out there. Crill oil is the best and it'll give you the damn burps. And I'm sorry, you want something like this, you don't get stuff for free.
[18:28.000 --> 18:39.000]  The krill is hallucinogenic. It's so good. It ain't my view. I'm not a medical statement here, but let me tell you something. I eat five caplets of krill oil before I go to bed. I'm seeing Santa Claus that night.
[18:39.000 --> 18:55.000]  So, your brain is made basically out of what fish oil is. So, we don't make a big profit off of it, but you know what, I'm just obsessed because whatever the best is we've got, I just can't lie to you. I just can't do it.
[18:55.000 --> 18:57.000]  infowarstore.com

[20:25.000 --> 20:38.000]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance live from the info wars.com studios. It's Alex Jones.
[20:38.000 --> 20:58.000]  Well, it turns out our psycho poster boy of mind control, Bobby Cremio from the fourth of July shooting in Highland Park, Illinois, was more prolific than I even knew. More videos of him on Facebook and other places have surfaced, reaching out to his FBI handlers.
[20:58.000 --> 21:16.000]  Here's one of those clips.
[21:16.000 --> 21:29.000]  Completely mentally ill, totally out of his mind. And through the drugs, through the shoot them up games, through the culture, through the copycatting, they can mind control now through the culture.
[21:29.000 --> 21:48.000]  But many times I'll have a federal handler as well. And that turned out to be the case, obviously in the failed kidnapping of Governor Whitmer in Michigan. And of course, the FBI handler in the Buffalo shooting. I mean, this is bad, ladies and gentlemen.
[21:48.000 --> 22:03.000]  He dressed up as communist. He dressed up as Trump supporters. He dressed up as a woman. He dressed up as the Joker. And when you see those eyes of your TV viewer, when you see that look, get away as fast as you can.
[22:03.000 --> 22:19.000]  That is the mass shooter. That is the program creature. That is Harrison Clybold. That is Adam Lanza. That is every one of these people. And they are coming.
[22:19.000 --> 22:35.000]  Just like special forces will parachute into his own hideout for months in the woods or mountains and quietly lays targets, marked targets for missiles to be dropped from planes or fired from a great distance.
[22:35.000 --> 22:53.000]  The media and the studies are there, advertises mass shootings to these people, pushes them, and it's like moths to an open flame or moths to the front porch light. They are attracted to it, and they can't help themselves, and they come.
[22:53.000 --> 23:12.000]  This is a well-known phenomenon, and we've talked about it a lot, but going back to the 50s, they learned that when one person might be once a year, twice a year, would jump off the Empire State Building, they'd have to station police up there because immediately, as soon as they hit the newspapers, radio, or TV, more people would go, you know what?
[23:12.000 --> 23:23.000]  That's a good idea. I'm going to climb up to the top of the Empire State Building, or bridges where people do it, and every time somebody jumps off the Brooklyn Bridge, the police, it's in the news.
[23:23.000 --> 23:40.000]  I'll tell you, three or four more people in the next 24 hours will show up to the same thing, and it comes in these cascades where one will trigger the other very suggestible individuals that are like, well, do I want to commit suicide with a gun?
[23:40.000 --> 23:49.000]  Do I want to commit suicide with a carbon monoxide? Do I want to jump off a building? Do I want to die of suicide by cop? Well, now there's a new option on the menu.
[23:49.000 --> 24:07.000]  It's like you go to an Italian restaurant, they have fettuccine alfredo, and they have veal parmesan, and they've got linguine, and they've got Caesar salad, and then now there's a new special dish.
[24:07.000 --> 24:23.000]  They even advertise on a whiteboard at the front of this restaurant. Try the special. You'll get lots of attention. Shoot up a big crowd of people. Schools are the best place to do it.
[24:23.000 --> 24:39.000]  And then the copycats. This is 101 criminology, 101 psychology. I know you all know this, but that's one big issue. Then you've got the people every week found five dead, 10 dead, 25 dead, 16 dead, 53 dead in tractor trailers.
[24:39.000 --> 24:54.000]  And it's just a bloop, bloop, bloop, just a little blip. Tractor trailer in New Mexico, tractor trailer in Arizona, tractor trailer in California, tractor trailer in Texas, tractor trailer in Texas, tractor trailer in Texas, tractor trailer in Arizona,
[24:54.000 --> 25:08.000]  and another tractor trailer in California, and another, and then a dungeon full of dead illegal aliens tortured to death and piles of dead illegals on the side of the street, heads cut off. It's just blip, blip, blip, blip, blip, blip, blip.
[25:08.000 --> 25:21.000]  It doesn't even make the news in many cases. The most dangerous land border in the world is the Texas-Mexico border, and today we're going to have a lawyer on who's involved in this later.
[25:21.000 --> 25:28.000]  I think it'll be in the third hour. I'll cover this coming up last segment of this hour.
[25:28.000 --> 25:42.000]  A whole string of Texas counties and towns are going to declare an emergency of invasion and total collapse and call for aid from the state and federal government.
[25:42.000 --> 26:05.000]  Texas is in a total and complete emergency, and today on the war room, 3 p.m. when they have the press conference, Owen Shroyer will be carrying the press conference live, 3 p.m. Central, infowars.com, forward slash show, and the live feed section of band.video.
[26:05.000 --> 26:19.000]  I hope you'll share it because Texas is calling for aid, and we need to listen to what's happening because the collapse of Texas heralds the collapse of the United States and the designed failed system.
[26:19.000 --> 26:25.000]  Speaking of that, I want to talk to listeners. I want to be very, very clear with you right now.
[26:25.000 --> 26:35.000]  I told you 30 months ago you need to start buying storeable foods because of inflation and coming food shortages under the Great Reset, and that you would only save money by buying food then because food prices would explode.
[26:35.000 --> 26:45.000]  Exactly what I told you happened. I only promote and sell things that I believe are the very best plan for myself personally, and so a lot of you have been on the fence about this.
[26:45.000 --> 26:55.000]  We have high quality storeable food, hundreds of different types of high quality nutritious food, ready to ship to you at the lowest price you're going to find for high quality food. You can find some stuff cheaper that's crap.
[26:55.000 --> 27:02.000]  This is what my family has. It's what I've stockpiled at the office, my home, what I give at Christmas to my cousins and aunts and uncles.
[27:02.000 --> 27:15.000]  I bought three times the food for the office and my family than I have bought for myself, and I have a five year food supply, ladies and gentlemen.

[27:57.000 --> 28:08.000]  The packaging of the food costs more than the same amount of food would cost in a grocery store.

[31:39.000 --> 31:41.000]  I mean, look at the Hair and Beard Support Formula.

[31:53.000 --> 31:54.000]  Quite well.
[31:54.000 --> 31:57.000]  My barber appreciates Hair and Beard Support for men.
[31:57.000 --> 31:59.000]  I go and see them quite often now.
[31:59.000 --> 32:06.000]  A lot of listeners have told us it's hard to find out of the thousands of great items at m4store.com all the storeable food.
[32:06.000 --> 32:14.000]  So we've made it easy with our great partners that supply us with the highest quality storeable food out there at the lowest price you're going to find for good food.

[32:31.000 --> 32:34.000]  And I'm telling you, it's going to get a lot worse.
[32:34.000 --> 32:35.000]  They have designed this.
[32:35.000 --> 32:40.000]  The way to beat them is to buy food now before your dollar is even more devalued.

[32:59.000 --> 33:11.000]  Thank you for your attention.
[33:11.000 --> 33:38.000]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[33:38.000 --> 33:47.000]  I mean careful attention to building and sustaining the liberal international world order with the United States and Europe at its core.
[33:47.000 --> 33:54.000]  What do you say to those families who say, listen, we can't afford to pay for 85 a gallon for months if not years.
[33:54.000 --> 33:55.000]  This is just not sustainable.
[33:55.000 --> 33:59.000]  This is about the future of the liberal world order and we have to stand firm.
[33:59.000 --> 34:06.000]  How long is it fair to expect American drivers and drivers around the world to pay that premium for this war?
[34:06.000 --> 34:13.000]  As long as it takes so Russia cannot in fact defeat Ukraine and move beyond Ukraine.
[34:13.000 --> 34:19.000]  Harry Truman famously had on his desk a plaque that said the buck stops here.
[34:19.000 --> 34:27.000]  Joe Biden seems to have replaced that plaque with instead the phrase the buck stops with Putin.
[34:27.000 --> 34:43.000]  The mass formation psychosis is strong over the United States. This is the liberal world order foisted upon us by our self serving occupier and chief globalist tool and new world order zealot Joe Biden.
[34:43.000 --> 34:52.000]  The affirmative task we have now is to actually create a new world order.
[34:52.000 --> 35:00.000]  As the Constitution ignoring occupier continues to split the country by feeding it into the clutches of Marxism.
[35:00.000 --> 35:09.000]  At a time of record inflation and this new polling this week shows that 85% of the US public thinks the country is going in the wrong direction.
[35:09.000 --> 35:25.000]  How do you explain this to those people who feel the country is going in the wrong direction including some of the leaders you've been meeting with this week who think that when you put all of this together it amounts to an America that is going backward.
[35:25.000 --> 35:32.000]  They do not think that. You haven't found one person, one world leader to say America is going backward.
[35:32.000 --> 35:42.000]  As bad as the turn he was in 1776 in many ways as I say it's worse now in 2022 because the far left unfortunately is taking control over the five major megaphones of our nation.
[35:42.000 --> 35:46.000]  Meaning the media, entertainment, academia and of late science and medicine.
[35:46.000 --> 36:05.000]  And people don't realize what they have. They bitch about it and then nowadays I am so upset that the things that we did and the things we fought for and the boys that died for it is all going down the drain.
[36:05.000 --> 36:10.000]  Our country is going to hell in a handbasket.
[36:10.000 --> 36:21.000]  We haven't got the country we had when I was raised. Not at all. Nobody will have the fun I had. Nobody will have the opportunity I had.
[36:21.000 --> 36:29.000]  They just are not the same. That's not what they died for.
[36:29.000 --> 36:48.000]  The walls are closing in on the remaining 932 days of Biden's occupation with an approval rating of 39% as a Harvard Caps Harris poll survey found that 71% of respondents do not think Biden should run for a second term.
[36:48.000 --> 36:59.000]  A University of Chicago's Institute of Politics poll reveals that 28% of voters felt it might soon be necessary to take up arms against the government.
[36:59.000 --> 37:25.000]  According to the data, one-third of Republicans, including 45% of strong Republicans, hold this belief about taking up arms. 35% of independent voters and surprisingly 20% of Democrats also agreed and as inflation reaches a record 40-year high, stock markets posted the worst first half of a year in over five decades.
[37:25.000 --> 37:34.000]  While the failing social security system is set to rise in 2023 by 11% due to the cost of living.
[37:34.000 --> 37:42.000]  Meanwhile, Biden mumbles about carving out the filibuster in order to codify Roe vs. Wade into law.
[37:42.000 --> 38:07.000]  But the occupier-in-chief faces a midterm pummeling, making it impossible for his dictatorship to continue to thrive.
[38:07.000 --> 38:15.000]  I don't care if you think I'm Satan reincarnated.
[38:15.000 --> 38:38.000]  This is a very good report. It's at Mandat Video. Biden's occupation unleashes America's wrath. We're going to have that report added under the live show feed.
[38:38.000 --> 39:03.000]  The U.N. has announced that the land border of Texas is now the most dangerous border in the world.
[39:03.000 --> 39:12.000]  Breaking headline, infowars.com, Texas counties declare invasion at southern border as local officials hope to get support from governor.
[39:12.000 --> 39:20.000]  The press conference is at 3 p.m. Central. We'll be covering it on the war room with Owen Schreuer, infowars.com, and stations across the country.
[39:20.000 --> 39:28.000]  I'll cover more of that and get into more of the details a little bit in the next segment. But as I said, bottom of the hour, third hour, we'll actually do the interview.
[39:28.000 --> 39:43.000]  Now, I want to open the phones up specifically next hour on the great reset in the design collapse of the economy and how inflation is affecting you and your business, or your job, or your family, or your capacity to live.
[39:43.000 --> 39:53.000]  That is the topic, is inflation by design in the great reset, and what do we do about stopping the globalist policy that is designed to end the industrial world?
[39:53.000 --> 40:04.000]  I'm going to be opening the phones up next hour. We'll be taking your calls starting at the bottom of the hour, right through to the bottom of the next hour, one hour of phone calls on that subject.
[40:04.000 --> 40:10.000]  Now, we're not going to break for a few minutes, but I want to just tell you this, some of the other stuff that's coming up.
[40:10.000 --> 40:19.000]  We have a bunch of carbon tax resistance in Europe. They're trying to openly ban having cows, as we told you they were going to do. That's coming here next.
[40:19.000 --> 40:23.000]  That's why Bill Gates and others are moving into synthetic beef and the rest of it. It's hard to believe, but it's here.
[40:23.000 --> 40:32.000]  We have farmers protesting all over Europe, blocking highways, millions of them showing up. It's huge. It's epic. It's being basically blacked out here in the U.S.
[40:32.000 --> 40:39.000]  We're going to be covering that some. We have some big COVID-19 vaccine damage and death news that's broken as well.
[40:39.000 --> 40:50.000]  We have more drag queen story time individuals being arrested for 25 counts of child pornography, and that ties in with them trying to put these pedophiles in the schools.
[40:50.000 --> 40:59.000]  We have big developments with the Supreme Court ending this current term with a lot of really big success and how the left is engaging in terrorism and attacking that.
[40:59.000 --> 41:03.000]  That is coming up as well.
[41:03.000 --> 41:09.000]  We also have some other big medical studies about falling asleep with the TV on could bring early death. Why does it do that?
[41:09.000 --> 41:13.000]  It's really key we'll be getting into that in a lot more detail as well.
[41:13.000 --> 41:21.000]  In video Ilhan Omar Bood at a huge Somali event in Minnesota saying get out of this country. We don't want you.
[41:21.000 --> 41:27.000]  Even the Somalis want freedom and don't want to be under this new rule of attorney. That's all coming up.
[41:27.000 --> 41:34.000]  But when I start the next hour, I'm going to spend two segments on this stack right here.
[41:34.000 --> 41:40.000]  TV viewers, you can see this big stack in my hand.
[41:40.000 --> 41:50.000]  This is mainstream government reports and mainstream news articles saying that genetic engineers have created synthetic aliens,
[41:50.000 --> 41:57.000]  not of any plant or animal DNA, but out of nanotech.
[41:57.000 --> 42:03.000]  And also globalists saying they believe they're going to create a new super species of cyborg that will forcibly replace humans.
[42:03.000 --> 42:06.000]  You've heard, you've all Harari and the rest of them say it.
[42:06.000 --> 42:12.000]  And the reason I raise that is this is really the big issue of the transhumanist revolution.
[42:12.000 --> 42:15.000]  And the Wall Street Journal saying looking forward to the end of humanity.
[42:15.000 --> 42:23.000]  On a Sunday special show that I taped on Saturday, I said for July 4th I declare independence against the alien invasion.
[42:23.000 --> 42:31.000]  And then I went on to say that is the nanotech, that is the genetic engineering, that are the globalists saying they're creating new species and they're going to replace humans.
[42:31.000 --> 42:41.000]  They cut that out. It was put in dozens of publications, millions of views online, just the edited clip of 25 seconds out of context.
[42:41.000 --> 42:48.000]  And I'm going to give you what actually said Sunday in context and I'm going to go over what's really happening and why they don't want you to know about this.
[42:48.000 --> 42:51.000]  Because they saw the full clip. They edited it to be deceptive.
[42:51.000 --> 42:57.000]  Like I was saying independence day was here and giant flying saucers as big as Manhattan were about to fire space beams.
[42:57.000 --> 43:12.000]  That's not what I said. We'll be right back.
[43:27.000 --> 43:37.000]  So please take action to declare independence from the New World Order by keeping the tip of the spear on air and getting great products at infowarsstore.com.
[43:37.000 --> 43:45.000]  I want to thank you all this July 4th for your continued fight for America and I would encourage you to join the fight even harder now because we're so close to winning.
[43:45.000 --> 43:57.000]  So please take action to declare independence from the New World Order by keeping the tip of the spear on air and getting great products at infowarsstore.com.
[43:57.000 --> 44:05.000]  And celebrate July 4th 1776 part two against the New World Order because the answer to 1984 is 1776.
[44:05.000 --> 44:16.000]  Hey how's it going Alex? Great last caller. I just wanted to start with plugging your sleep supplements. It's basically the only way I get sleep anymore with all the gaslighting, moralization and absurdity.
[44:16.000 --> 44:19.000]  It's like we're living in a twilight zone.
[44:19.000 --> 44:22.000]  Alright Eric in New Hampshire. Eric thanks for calling. Go ahead.
[44:22.000 --> 44:28.000]  Hey Alex, thanks for taking my call. If I could I just want to throw a quick plug out for one of the products. The X2 does wonders.

[44:38.000 --> 44:39.000]  Honored to talk to you.

[45:59.000 --> 46:10.000]  At this point, best case scenario is a few years of hard times for us all. And if we don't turn it around soon, then it will only get worse.
[46:10.000 --> 46:17.000]  But as bad as things are, we still have time to prepare. And that alone is something to be grateful for.
[46:17.000 --> 46:25.000]  A gravity water filter will provide you with clean, healthy water, even in the event of your taps getting shut off.
[46:25.000 --> 46:31.000]  And having your own food will save you from getting ensnared in government FEMA camps.
[46:31.000 --> 46:38.000]  And if you've already stocked up enough for your own family, you might want to consider stocking up for your neighbors.
[46:38.000 --> 46:42.000]  Some of your neighbors might not be prepared for what's coming.
[46:42.000 --> 46:48.000]  But you can help them by having an abundance of storable foods and water filtration.
[46:48.000 --> 46:53.000]  Whoever sews bountifully will also reap bountifully.
[46:53.000 --> 47:08.000]  Stock up now at preparetoday.com.
[47:23.000 --> 47:33.000]  Broadcasting worldwide. It's Alex Jones.
[47:33.000 --> 47:39.000]  We then also then decided to look at the youngest cohort working age folks, the millennials.
[47:39.000 --> 47:44.000]  And the age group, we identified millennials as 25 to 44.
[47:44.000 --> 47:51.000]  And what we saw there was alarming. Their excess mortality obviously spiked into the end of 2020.
[47:51.000 --> 48:03.000]  But then into the fall of 2021, it jumped to new all-time highs of 84% excess mortality from baseline, the prior five years baseline.
[48:03.000 --> 48:13.000]  And despite the rate of change from the summer into the fall, the August, September, October timeframe was alarming and indicated an event occurred.
[48:13.000 --> 48:18.000]  That event, in our opinion, were corporate mandates.
[48:18.000 --> 48:26.000]  And the numbers that represent from March of 21 to Feb of 22 was 61,000 excess deaths.
[48:26.000 --> 48:32.000]  That's in the millennial cohort. If you remember, 58,000 soldiers died in the Vietnam War.
[48:32.000 --> 48:37.000]  So the millennials in one year experienced a silent Vietnam War.
[48:37.000 --> 48:42.000]  And, you know, the Vietnam War occurred over 10 years.
[48:42.000 --> 48:48.000]  So, you know, this is an alarming number of young working age folks who just disappeared.
[48:48.000 --> 48:55.000]  You know, the criticism I get is that, oh, it's drug overdoses, it's missing treatments, it's suicides.
[48:55.000 --> 49:09.000]  Well, the rate of change into the fall, the event known as the corporate mandates, suggests that you can't convince me that everyone decided in a three-month timeframe to all commit suicide, overdose on drugs,
[49:09.000 --> 49:12.000]  or all miss their cancer screening treatments.
[49:12.000 --> 49:17.000]  So that, for me, the millennials is what I call the smoking gun, okay?
[49:17.000 --> 49:22.000]  This is a group that shouldn't be dying, especially in year two of a pandemic.
[49:22.000 --> 49:31.000]  You can't tell me the virus switched from only going after older folks to now going after younger folks and switching from respiratory to cardiovascular.
[49:31.000 --> 49:38.000]  And that's what we're seeing mostly occurring with these young folks, cardiovascular issues.
[49:38.000 --> 49:49.000]  That is Edward Dowd, a big stock picker and analyst, very successful, predicted all this was happening three years ago, 30 months ago or so.
[49:49.000 --> 49:53.000]  And I've got some COVID-19 tyranny news I want to hit right now, but I want you to understand something.
[49:53.000 --> 49:56.000]  The good news is humanity is waking up to what's happening.
[49:56.000 --> 50:07.000]  This is a multifaceted, thousand-prong attack, economic, cultural, biomedical, hitting us from so many angles.
[50:07.000 --> 50:17.000]  But it's all been prepared and blueprinted and war-gamed by the Rockefeller Foundation, by the Carnegie Endowment, by the United Nations, by John Hopkins.
[50:17.000 --> 50:19.000]  And that's how we know all this.
[50:19.000 --> 50:27.000]  I didn't just say, oh, look, these documents match what's happening a few years ago when this takeover started in early 2000.
[50:27.000 --> 50:33.000]  I was doing whole shows and writing books and making films, hit films.
[50:33.000 --> 50:38.000]  I mean, no exaggeration. Remember Google Video?
[50:38.000 --> 50:44.000]  And then when they bought YouTube, 16, 17 years ago, they began to phase it out.
[50:44.000 --> 50:51.000]  I released Endgame, blueprint for global enslavement in 2007, and Google Video was only around for about another year and a half after that.
[50:51.000 --> 51:00.000]  The last time I checked Google Video, it had 89 million views on it.
[51:00.000 --> 51:03.000]  And then they killed Google Video.
[51:03.000 --> 51:08.000]  Now, it had one version with 20 million views on YouTube. They killed that a few years ago.
[51:08.000 --> 51:10.000]  Another version with 5 million. They killed that.
[51:10.000 --> 51:14.000]  There's a bunch of versions with a few hundred thousand views left. They're killing those.
[51:14.000 --> 51:17.000]  We have it posted at Band-Aid Video for free.
[51:17.000 --> 51:20.000]  The point is, if you go watch it, you're going to want to throw up in your mouth.
[51:20.000 --> 51:25.000]  It's two and a half hours long. You'll read the quotes, the preparations, the getting ready.
[51:25.000 --> 51:32.000]  And then in the years after that, 2008, 9, 10 and 11, there are hours of videos that we've played here,
[51:32.000 --> 51:36.000]  where I specifically read from Operation Lockstep, Rockefeller Foundation,
[51:36.000 --> 51:40.000]  I specifically read from the UN documents and say they're going to release a virus,
[51:40.000 --> 51:43.000]  probably a bird flu strain out of China.
[51:43.000 --> 51:48.000]  It will be one that continues to infect, unlike other viruses, because I was reading their battle plans.
[51:48.000 --> 51:55.000]  They don't even really shield what they're doing with plausible deniability.
[51:55.000 --> 52:01.000]  They just say it out the open. We have Peter Dazik. We have Fauci on C-SPAN saying in 2009,
[52:01.000 --> 52:05.000]  we need a new virus to be released out of China, probably a bird flu strain.
[52:05.000 --> 52:10.000]  It'll blow up the old system and get rid of the current FDA systems that we have around the world,
[52:10.000 --> 52:13.000]  where it takes five years to get an approval. We'll get instant approval.
[52:13.000 --> 52:20.000]  And now the FDA announced two weeks ago, oh, after this with the mRNA gene therapy,
[52:20.000 --> 52:25.000]  we're not even going to have trials anymore, period, for quote, vaccines.
[52:25.000 --> 52:30.000]  All the vaccine is something they're injecting into you. It's not the classic vaccine, as you know it.
[52:30.000 --> 52:34.000]  They give you a little bit of the bad thing that's dead or attenuated, so you learn how to beat it,
[52:34.000 --> 52:37.000]  but you don't get the bad effects. That's a real technology. It works.
[52:37.000 --> 52:41.000]  It can have side effects. It can have Trojan horses. It can have additives.
[52:41.000 --> 52:44.000]  It can have hormones to sterilize you. It's been done. It's on record.
[52:44.000 --> 52:50.000]  But it's a totally different science. And so they're just naming mRNA and a bunch of other viral technologies
[52:50.000 --> 52:54.000]  where the viruses attack certain parts of the body, including the brain, to quote, reprogram it.
[52:54.000 --> 52:58.000]  The anti-stress vaccines, they've been testing for 20 years.
[52:58.000 --> 53:06.000]  They're now rolling out in the last five years in the military, anti-PTSD shots, anti-depression shots.
[53:06.000 --> 53:13.000]  And they are virus injections that are programmed to only attack certain synapses in the brain,
[53:13.000 --> 53:18.000]  and it gives you a select viral delivery replication lobotomy.
[53:18.000 --> 53:22.000]  You can find it out there somewhere. It used to have millions of views on YouTube.
[53:22.000 --> 53:27.000]  They took it down, but I did brain-eating vaccines. Special report.
[53:27.000 --> 53:29.000]  Gave it a shocking name, because that's what it is.
[53:29.000 --> 53:32.000]  But see, that's why they've got to keep us off of the general internet,
[53:32.000 --> 53:38.000]  because people will go back and see that and go, oh, my God, this happened absolutely the way Jones said.
[53:38.000 --> 53:41.000]  Well, it's not the way Jones said. And there's a new phenomenon.
[53:41.000 --> 53:45.000]  I don't mind it. It's very sad for people out there that I see without even looking,
[53:45.000 --> 53:50.000]  and people sent to me on Instagram, Twitter, everywhere. Jones is one of them.
[53:50.000 --> 53:53.000]  That's how he knows this. He's with them.
[53:53.000 --> 54:00.000]  That is such a crutch, and that is so wrong, because I want you, and a lot of you have already done this,
[54:00.000 --> 54:02.000]  to learn how to know what I know.
[54:02.000 --> 54:05.000]  You can go read Operation Lockstep from 2011.
[54:05.000 --> 54:09.000]  You can read SPARS 2025, 2028 from 2018.
[54:09.000 --> 54:17.000]  You can go read the tabletop exercise that they did in 2000, or in 2019.
[54:17.000 --> 54:24.000]  You can go see all this and then look at it, and when you talk about the SPARS 2025, 2028 event,
[54:24.000 --> 54:31.000]  in general, Flynn was blown away by it, said it was the most important thing he'd seen, said everybody should watch it.
[54:31.000 --> 54:37.000]  It's only got 4 million views on Band-Aught Video, and I don't mean that sarcastically. It needs 100 million views.
[54:37.000 --> 54:43.000]  And they have the next three years laid out, really, it's set in 2020, 2023.
[54:43.000 --> 54:47.000]  How they give you the shot, people then learn it doesn't work, then they'll actually blame some of the executives,
[54:47.000 --> 54:51.000]  that they'll move forward, now that our immune systems are controlled, they'll bring in the real tyranny,
[54:51.000 --> 54:56.000]  they'll bring out our mask, they'll be forced inoculations, they'll be a World ID vaccine card,
[54:56.000 --> 54:59.000]  they'll be used to the cell phones to be the backbone for the new carbon tax,
[54:59.000 --> 55:05.000]  and the social credit score and the universal basic income that's coming with the collapse.
[55:05.000 --> 55:12.000]  And they even have tweets in there that say, on this day you release that tweet, on this day you release this tweet.
[55:12.000 --> 55:17.000]  And when you go into the documents, it's the exact tweets they put out for COVID,
[55:17.000 --> 55:22.000]  they changed the name on the top of it, but if you move the letters around, it's the same acronym on the top.
[55:22.000 --> 55:28.000]  I mean, you talk about criminally bragging in everyone's faces.
[55:28.000 --> 55:34.000]  That's what we're dealing with here. So, this is a powerful meme that Abigail Joy put out.
[55:34.000 --> 55:41.000]  They ran out of this, and it's a baby with milk formula, but stocked up on this,
[55:41.000 --> 55:44.000]  the injections for six month olds and older.
[55:44.000 --> 55:52.000]  And this is what we were just talking about with what was being talked about with Mr. Dowd earlier.
[55:52.000 --> 55:56.000]  Serious adverse effects from COVID vaccine, very high, no other vaccine comes close
[55:56.000 --> 55:59.000]  since former CDC Vaccine Safety Committee member.
[55:59.000 --> 56:02.000]  Remember, they had three committees, the majority of them resigned,
[56:02.000 --> 56:09.000]  because they wouldn't sign on to any of this garbage, 16 and up, above 75, booster shots.
[56:09.000 --> 56:11.000]  All the committees said no, so they would have them resign.
[56:11.000 --> 56:15.000]  They finally got a committee that unanimously said you have six month olds and up the shots,
[56:15.000 --> 56:18.000]  give people three, four boosters a year that totally destroy you.
[56:18.000 --> 56:22.000]  You wonder where are these former CDC Vaccine Safety Committee members?
[56:22.000 --> 56:26.000]  Well, here they are from Harvard Medical School.
[56:26.000 --> 56:31.000]  Dr. Martin Kludorf came out and said they're deadly, they're dangerous, it's all a fraud.
[56:31.000 --> 56:36.000]  Oh, that's fake news. What's Twitter do? Blocks it.
[56:36.000 --> 56:41.000]  That's murderous. That's aiding and abetting.
[56:41.000 --> 56:46.000]  Twitter's censor story of a British mother who died after the reaction to COVID vaccine.
[56:46.000 --> 56:49.000]  Another article up on infowars.com.
[56:49.000 --> 56:54.000]  Look at this madness. Babies now having masks covering their eyes and nose and everything,
[56:54.000 --> 56:58.000]  literally suffocating them. You saw a person doing that before three years ago, you'd call the police.
[56:58.000 --> 57:08.000]  Now it's good. It's all mind control. The dictator of New Zealand is begging UK tourists to return to New Zealand
[57:08.000 --> 57:15.000]  as she prepares to finally open borders. Now suddenly they're not worried about the virus.
[57:15.000 --> 57:20.000]  We're going to go to break. We're going to come back with the emergency being declared in Texas.
[57:20.000 --> 57:24.000]  We're going to come back with the design collapse, the economy.
[57:24.000 --> 57:30.000]  We're going to come back with what I said in context when I declared independence against the alien takeover that is transhumanism.
[57:30.000 --> 57:35.000]  That's the next hour. So centrally important for everybody to know.
[57:35.000 --> 57:39.000]  And yes, the July 4th sale is going to end in just a few days.

[59:20.000 --> 59:24.000]  ready to ship to you and your family. With the inflation happening, with the food shortages,
[59:24.000 --> 59:27.000]  with the wars, with the collapsing wars, everything's happening.
[59:27.000 --> 59:33.000]  One of the most important things you can make is to have high quality storeable food, water filtration, air filtration and more.
[59:33.000 --> 59:38.000]  And it's not just those items. It's hundreds of other high quality preparedness items and survival items right now
[59:38.000 --> 59:43.000]  and preparewithalix.com that again redirects to preparetoday.com.
[59:43.000 --> 59:48.000]  I would not procrastinate, ladies and gentlemen. One of the most important things you can do is get ahead of inflation now
[59:48.000 --> 59:50.000]  because the inflation is just beginning.
[59:50.000 --> 59:57.000]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[1:00:06.000 --> 1:00:15.000]  China has recently invited Indonesia, Malaysia, Iran, Egypt and several other countries to join BRICS.
[1:00:15.000 --> 1:00:22.000]  A growing world alliance led by Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa.
[1:00:22.000 --> 1:00:29.000]  While some are reporting that BRICS is somehow challenging the globalists, this is demonstrably false.
[1:00:29.000 --> 1:00:35.000]  The original concept for BRICS was proposed by the chief economist for GNSACS.
[1:00:35.000 --> 1:00:41.000]  BRICS's new development bank is staffed by no players of the IMF and World Bank.
[1:00:41.000 --> 1:00:48.000]  And BRICS has repeatedly affirmed their commitment to the United Nations Agenda 2030.
[1:00:48.000 --> 1:00:58.000]  Aside from Brazil's President Bolsonaro, all of BRICS nation states have pushed the COVID-19 lockdowns and experimental shots.
[1:00:58.000 --> 1:01:05.000]  And China recently announced five more years of their brutal zero COVID lockdowns.
[1:01:05.000 --> 1:01:14.000]  BRICS is also pushing a digital currency and has launched a vaccine research and development center for member states.
[1:01:14.000 --> 1:01:17.000]  BRICS is clearly not anti-globalist.
[1:01:17.000 --> 1:01:24.000]  Even the CCP's state-run media explains how BRICS now leads the globalization mission.
[1:01:24.000 --> 1:01:29.000]  But they are all turning against the United States and its allies.
[1:01:29.000 --> 1:01:36.000]  Xi Jinping accused the US of weaponizing the financial system with their sanctions against Russia,
[1:01:36.000 --> 1:01:40.000]  which has caused the average person to suffer worldwide.
[1:01:40.000 --> 1:01:46.000]  And Vladimir Putin suggested that BRICS could provide a new world reserve currency.
[1:01:46.000 --> 1:01:50.000]  At the recent St. Petersburg International Economic Forum,
[1:01:50.000 --> 1:01:54.000]  Putin blamed the West for disrupting the international economy
[1:01:54.000 --> 1:01:59.000]  and announced that NATO's unipolar world order is over.
[1:01:59.000 --> 1:02:04.000]  In just three months, Russia has managed to reverse inflation
[1:02:04.000 --> 1:02:09.000]  and has increased their financial surplus to more than four times it was last year.
[1:02:09.000 --> 1:02:14.000]  Russia is now thriving, and Putin announced that their international priority
[1:02:14.000 --> 1:02:18.000]  is to increase food deliveries to countries that need it the most.
[1:02:18.000 --> 1:02:22.000]  They are pouring billions into their farming communities,
[1:02:22.000 --> 1:02:25.000]  raised the minimum wage by 10%,
[1:02:25.000 --> 1:02:29.000]  and provided more money to pensioners and families with children.
[1:02:29.000 --> 1:02:35.000]  He also criticized the West for choosing an economic suicidal path
[1:02:35.000 --> 1:02:38.000]  and having suicidal intentions,
[1:02:38.000 --> 1:02:43.000]  which seems to be the only explanation for what the Biden administration is doing.
[1:02:43.000 --> 1:02:48.000]  They have deliberately cut off our fuel, which will cut off our food,
[1:02:48.000 --> 1:02:53.000]  and they are pushing the deadly shots for every single healthy child in America.
[1:02:53.000 --> 1:02:57.000]  They have opened our borders and are pushing for a world war
[1:02:57.000 --> 1:03:03.000]  with a thriving nuclear power while destroying our military from within.
[1:03:03.000 --> 1:03:06.000]  The Biden administration's plan is clear.
[1:03:06.000 --> 1:03:09.000]  Destroy America from within.
[1:03:09.000 --> 1:03:14.000]  And they have amassed an army of the miserable through mass psychosis,
[1:03:14.000 --> 1:03:19.000]  an army of ugly, insane, sexually obsessed deviants
[1:03:19.000 --> 1:03:24.000]  who want abortion on demand and acceptance for pedophiles,
[1:03:24.000 --> 1:03:28.000]  psychotics who castrate their own children because it's trendy,
[1:03:28.000 --> 1:03:33.000]  and mindless drones who believe the human race needs to die.
[1:03:33.000 --> 1:03:39.000]  At what point will Americans begin to care enough to work together and do something
[1:03:39.000 --> 1:03:42.000]  when the nuclear bomb starts falling?
[1:03:42.000 --> 1:03:46.000]  America is being mass murdered by our own federal government,
[1:03:46.000 --> 1:03:50.000]  and the emerging new globalized economy will let it happen.
[1:03:50.000 --> 1:03:55.000]  Unless Americans take back control of their own government,
[1:03:55.000 --> 1:03:57.000]  America will soon end.
[1:03:57.000 --> 1:04:01.000]  That's the plan being executed right now.
[1:04:01.000 --> 1:04:03.000]  Now!
[1:04:03.000 --> 1:04:06.000]  They think you're a goldfish!
[1:04:06.000 --> 1:04:09.000]  I've been betting on you my whole life!
[1:04:09.000 --> 1:04:12.000]  What do they know? I don't think you're stupid.
[1:04:12.000 --> 1:04:18.000]  One man and a wrecked woman, all tentacles are cut off.
[1:04:18.000 --> 1:04:21.000]  And we're kicking these trainers' asses politically,
[1:04:21.000 --> 1:04:23.000]  and we're not backing down at her.
[1:04:23.000 --> 1:04:25.000]  I want to get these people.
[1:04:25.000 --> 1:04:27.000]  We're winning. I can feel the spirit rising.
[1:04:27.000 --> 1:04:30.000]  Can't you? We have broken their back.
[1:04:30.000 --> 1:04:32.000]  Yes, I can feel it.
[1:04:35.000 --> 1:04:37.000]  Let's go!
[1:04:37.000 --> 1:04:40.000]  Come on, come on, come on, come on!
[1:04:40.000 --> 1:04:43.000]  Come on, come on, come on!
[1:04:46.000 --> 1:04:51.000]  Vengeance is coming! Fire is coming!
[1:04:51.000 --> 1:04:55.000]  The real revolution against you is coming!
[1:04:55.000 --> 1:05:08.000]  And you will burn in hell!
[1:05:25.000 --> 1:05:28.000]  That's a huge deal.
[1:05:55.000 --> 1:05:59.000]  And don't forget, Alex Jones' right t-shirt while you're there.
[1:06:25.000 --> 1:06:43.000]  Too many kids are what's making the planet worse.
[1:06:43.000 --> 1:06:45.000]  A lot of these kids come from bad gene pools.
[1:06:45.000 --> 1:06:49.000]  They don't have stable parents making good decisions.
[1:06:49.000 --> 1:06:56.000]  Mercury-containing vaccines may help not harm kids according to two new studies in the journal Pediatric.
[1:06:56.000 --> 1:06:59.000]  These new studies suggest that the opposite,
[1:06:59.000 --> 1:07:03.000]  that the preservatives may actually be associated with improved behavior and mental performance.
[1:07:03.000 --> 1:07:06.000]  Fluoride in water is supposed to fight tooth decay,
[1:07:06.000 --> 1:07:08.000]  but could it also cause cancer?
[1:07:08.000 --> 1:07:15.000]  For now, the government had the right under U.S. law to conduct secret testing on the American public under a specific condition.
[1:07:15.000 --> 1:07:19.000]  We'll have to work the dark side or we'll spend time in the shadows.
[1:07:19.000 --> 1:07:23.000]  Any attempt to achieve world order must be the work of the devil.
[1:07:23.000 --> 1:07:27.000]  Well, join me, and I'm glad to sit here at the right hand to see.
[1:07:27.000 --> 1:07:30.000]  There's a need for a new world order.
[1:07:30.000 --> 1:07:45.000]  Someday, in the next few years, a solution will emerge.
[1:07:45.000 --> 1:07:48.000]  Liberal world order.
[1:07:48.000 --> 1:07:53.000]  Cutting your power, brainwashing your children, destroying your currency, annihilating your borders,
[1:07:53.000 --> 1:07:56.000]  and drag queens out of file time.
[1:07:56.000 --> 1:07:59.000]  It's live.
[1:07:59.000 --> 1:08:04.000]  Inside the new world order.
[1:08:04.000 --> 1:08:07.000]  You can pretend you're part of it and be destroyed,
[1:08:07.000 --> 1:08:10.000]  or you can wake up and connect to God and get informed,
[1:08:10.000 --> 1:08:15.000]  get ready and start informing others and win.
[1:08:15.000 --> 1:08:17.000]  All right.
[1:08:17.000 --> 1:08:19.000]  Let's hit some really big news right now,
[1:08:19.000 --> 1:08:21.000]  and then we're going to take calls starting at the bottom of the hour
[1:08:21.000 --> 1:08:30.000]  for a special guest joins us on the declaration of emergency about to be made in Texas of total invasion and collapse.
[1:08:30.000 --> 1:08:33.000]  This happens a lot, and I know when I say these things on air,
[1:08:33.000 --> 1:08:35.000]  they're going to be taken out of context,
[1:08:35.000 --> 1:08:37.000]  but God works in mysterious ways,
[1:08:37.000 --> 1:08:42.000]  and what they make fun of me about today, people discover to be true tomorrow.
[1:08:42.000 --> 1:08:48.000]  And so I was up here Saturday taping parts of the Sunday and Monday show.
[1:08:48.000 --> 1:08:53.000]  So I wanted to give the crew some time off, but wild horses can't drag me away.
[1:08:53.000 --> 1:08:56.000]  And I had a big stack of news here about human animal cloning
[1:08:56.000 --> 1:08:58.000]  and Congress refusing to outlaw it,
[1:08:58.000 --> 1:09:02.000]  and news articles where MIT was saying we've created aliens.
[1:09:02.000 --> 1:09:06.000]  I'll show you the articles here in a moment.
[1:09:06.000 --> 1:09:09.000]  And I was just thinking, you know, this is all a transhumanist revolution.
[1:09:09.000 --> 1:09:12.000]  In the Davos group, Bilderberg groups on words,
[1:09:12.000 --> 1:09:14.000]  they said they're building a post-human world.
[1:09:14.000 --> 1:09:20.000]  They're building hours of their main futurist, Yuval Harari.
[1:09:20.000 --> 1:09:25.000]  Noah Yuval Harari saying there'll be no humans by 2047,
[1:09:25.000 --> 1:09:29.000]  and Ray Kurzweil, the head of Google's Future Project says the same thing.
[1:09:29.000 --> 1:09:33.000]  I mean, this is a cult, and Elon Musk has talked about it,
[1:09:33.000 --> 1:09:35.000]  and said it's a cult of the AI gods.
[1:09:35.000 --> 1:09:39.000]  They believe they're building a new species that is alien to anything ever seen on this earth.
[1:09:39.000 --> 1:09:41.000]  And alien just means not of this world.
[1:09:41.000 --> 1:09:45.000]  I'm going to show you a stack of news articles and scientific reports.
[1:09:45.000 --> 1:09:49.000]  And I mentioned these on the Sunday show, but they took it out of context.
[1:09:49.000 --> 1:09:52.000]  They took a 25-second clip out of a 10-minute segment,
[1:09:52.000 --> 1:09:58.000]  where I explained aliens don't come in flying saucers like Independence Day.
[1:09:58.000 --> 1:10:02.000]  The globalists believe they're about to create a new species, these mad scientists,
[1:10:02.000 --> 1:10:03.000]  and that we're obsolete.
[1:10:03.000 --> 1:10:06.000]  They're building the aliens on the space stations.
[1:10:06.000 --> 1:10:08.000]  I'm going to show you a NASA press release.
[1:10:08.000 --> 1:10:11.000]  Aliens created on space station.
[1:10:11.000 --> 1:10:15.000]  And they are creating a medical tyranny to take over our bodies
[1:10:15.000 --> 1:10:19.000]  and force us to merge with this and to create this new entity,
[1:10:19.000 --> 1:10:23.000]  but the majority of us will die during the testing of it.
[1:10:23.000 --> 1:10:27.000]  And that's what the FDA coming out two weeks ago and saying,
[1:10:27.000 --> 1:10:29.000]  we're no longer going to do studies.
[1:10:29.000 --> 1:10:32.000]  We're just going to inject gene therapy into you and see what happens.
[1:10:32.000 --> 1:10:35.000]  And we've got Bill Gates saying it's the biggest experiment ever.
[1:10:35.000 --> 1:10:38.000]  And they've got CERN, not just on the biological level,
[1:10:38.000 --> 1:10:43.000]  but on the atomic level, trying to create breakthroughs to other dimensions.
[1:10:43.000 --> 1:10:46.000]  And they say, yeah, it might create a black hole or a strange look to destroy the planet,
[1:10:46.000 --> 1:10:48.000]  but that's a price we're willing to pay.
[1:10:48.000 --> 1:10:53.000]  So they're creating alien dimensions, things that have never been here before.
[1:10:53.000 --> 1:10:55.000]  Artificial black holes.
[1:10:55.000 --> 1:10:57.000]  I mean, they were making those in the 80s.
[1:10:57.000 --> 1:10:58.000]  They'll probably make a joke about that.
[1:10:58.000 --> 1:11:00.000]  Jones says they're making black holes.
[1:11:00.000 --> 1:11:04.000]  We'll just type in, Japanese scientists create black holes, 1987.
[1:11:04.000 --> 1:11:14.000]  So this is what these people always do, and they know what they're doing.
[1:11:14.000 --> 1:11:19.000]  So I come in with a very clean 10-minute segment Sunday,
[1:11:19.000 --> 1:11:23.000]  and I say everything I just said.
[1:11:23.000 --> 1:11:29.000]  And I explained that splicing a bunch of viruses together with nanotech creates a new alien creature,
[1:11:29.000 --> 1:11:32.000]  and that's why COVID-19 will always re-infect.
[1:11:32.000 --> 1:11:35.000]  That's why you can never stop it other than fortifying your body.
[1:11:35.000 --> 1:11:37.000]  And that's just a stopgap.
[1:11:37.000 --> 1:11:42.000]  They've introduced things that will collapse, not just our civilization, our economy, our borders,
[1:11:42.000 --> 1:11:45.000]  but our very immune systems and bodies.
[1:11:45.000 --> 1:11:48.000]  And so it's on MSNBC.
[1:11:48.000 --> 1:11:49.000]  It's on CNN.
[1:11:49.000 --> 1:11:50.000]  It's on ABC.
[1:11:50.000 --> 1:11:51.000]  It's on Newsweek.
[1:11:51.000 --> 1:11:52.000]  It's everywhere.
[1:11:52.000 --> 1:11:57.000]  Alex Jones claims aliens want to make humans into cyborg slaves of Satan.
[1:11:57.000 --> 1:12:00.000]  Well, we can put the image on screen from five years ago
[1:12:00.000 --> 1:12:04.000]  that really caught people's attention, a Mark Zuckerberg walking into one of his events,
[1:12:04.000 --> 1:12:06.000]  and he's walking bipedally,
[1:12:06.000 --> 1:12:13.000]  but all of his minions are strapped in to the VR goggles.
[1:12:13.000 --> 1:12:17.000]  Those are cyborg slaves of Satan.
[1:12:17.000 --> 1:12:22.000]  People love that term, I coined, but the point is, is that it's a metaphor for what's happening,
[1:12:22.000 --> 1:12:25.000]  and then I laid it all out.
[1:12:25.000 --> 1:12:30.000]  So there's an article in infowars.com, you can see the video with a million views,
[1:12:30.000 --> 1:12:34.000]  and there's a bunch of others, but Alex Jones trends on Twitter
[1:12:34.000 --> 1:12:39.000]  for celebrating Independence Day from cyborg slaves of Satan, Ron Flukosky,
[1:12:39.000 --> 1:12:43.000]  who always puts out edited clips of me, but it's okay, God turns it towards good,
[1:12:43.000 --> 1:12:45.000]  said, Alex Jones, this July 4th message,
[1:12:45.000 --> 1:12:47.000]  I declare a Declaration of Independence against the alien force
[1:12:47.000 --> 1:12:49.000]  that's attempting to exterminate the majority of us,
[1:12:49.000 --> 1:12:51.000]  and I go on to say it's transhumanist and globalist,
[1:12:51.000 --> 1:12:53.000]  while we were controlled by Satan.
[1:12:53.000 --> 1:12:59.000]  And force the minority to merge with AI computers and become cyborg slaves of Satan.
[1:12:59.000 --> 1:13:06.000]  And then it trended in the top of Twitter.
[1:13:06.000 --> 1:13:12.000]  So here's the clip I play, or here's the clip they take out of context,
[1:13:12.000 --> 1:13:15.000]  and then I'll play some of the actual segment in context,
[1:13:15.000 --> 1:13:21.000]  and then I'll show you a stack of headlines NASA creates aliens from NASA.
[1:13:21.000 --> 1:13:27.000]  And I'll show you articles where you can read top tech heads,
[1:13:27.000 --> 1:13:29.000]  billionaires saying, we believe humans are obsolete,
[1:13:29.000 --> 1:13:31.000]  we're creating an alien species.
[1:13:31.000 --> 1:13:34.000]  I'm going to show it all to you, and that's what I did Sunday.
[1:13:34.000 --> 1:13:37.000]  But see, you're tuned in here so you know.
[1:13:37.000 --> 1:13:39.000]  Everybody else just sees this out of context.
[1:13:39.000 --> 1:13:42.000]  Oh, the frogs are gay, part of an hour-long report I did
[1:13:42.000 --> 1:13:45.000]  with university reports on the frogs trying to have sex with their males,
[1:13:45.000 --> 1:13:47.000]  instead of with females, and then become extinct.
[1:13:47.000 --> 1:13:50.000]  Those were real reports, but see, they took that out of context.
[1:13:50.000 --> 1:13:52.000]  But it doesn't matter.
[1:13:52.000 --> 1:13:55.000]  A decade later, everywhere, Alex Jones was right, it's true.
[1:13:55.000 --> 1:13:58.000]  What's in the water? Oh my God, it's so serious.
[1:13:58.000 --> 1:14:02.000]  So here is the short clip out of context.
[1:14:02.000 --> 1:14:09.000]  I declare this July 4th, 2022, to be a declaration of independence
[1:14:09.000 --> 1:14:12.000]  against the alien force on this planet today,
[1:14:12.000 --> 1:14:16.000]  waging war against humans and our biology and our very future
[1:14:16.000 --> 1:14:20.000]  that is attempting to exterminate the majority of us,
[1:14:20.000 --> 1:14:24.000]  and force the minority that's left to merge with AI computers
[1:14:24.000 --> 1:14:28.000]  and become cyborg slaves of Satan.
[1:14:28.000 --> 1:14:36.000]  The average person spends now three days out of seven days
[1:14:36.000 --> 1:14:40.000]  looking at screens, and most of those messages are anti-human.
[1:14:40.000 --> 1:14:44.000]  Men can have babies, two women can have a baby.
[1:14:44.000 --> 1:14:47.000]  All of this is to get you off balance and not standing up
[1:14:47.000 --> 1:14:49.000]  for what you are and who you are.
[1:14:49.000 --> 1:14:51.000]  And at the base of it is this transhumanist movement.
[1:14:51.000 --> 1:14:54.000]  So when we come back, I'm going to play a few minutes in context,
[1:14:54.000 --> 1:14:56.000]  as I then go right into the type of alien I'm talking about.
[1:14:56.000 --> 1:14:59.000]  And what's happening, but I'm saying, I believe the Bible.
[1:14:59.000 --> 1:15:00.000]  I've seen it true.
[1:15:00.000 --> 1:15:02.000]  Predicting the mark of the beast, all this, that it is a
[1:15:02.000 --> 1:15:07.000]  interdimensional attack, a collaboration of collaborator humans
[1:15:07.000 --> 1:15:12.000]  put into power in high places by the principalities of this earth,
[1:15:12.000 --> 1:15:17.000]  off-world creatures marooned here, to attack humans and disease
[1:15:17.000 --> 1:15:20.000]  humans and annihilate humans while they use us that are
[1:15:20.000 --> 1:15:21.000]  actually more advanced than them.
[1:15:21.000 --> 1:15:24.000]  We just don't know who we are to build the advanced technology
[1:15:24.000 --> 1:15:26.000]  they need to then escape.
[1:15:26.000 --> 1:15:29.000]  And boy, do they attack that and make fun of it because they know
[1:15:29.000 --> 1:15:31.000]  I'm exposing the Illuminati cult.
[1:15:31.000 --> 1:15:33.000]  You know what goes on at the Illuminati?
[1:15:33.000 --> 1:15:34.000]  You know what goes on at the top of Hollywood?
[1:15:34.000 --> 1:15:36.000]  You know what goes on when I'm sitting there with
[1:15:36.000 --> 1:15:38.000]  Bilderberg group members and I'm sitting there talking to
[1:15:38.000 --> 1:15:41.000]  top globalists, which I've had private meetings with a lot of them.
[1:15:41.000 --> 1:15:42.000]  They don't joke about this.
[1:15:42.000 --> 1:15:44.000]  They know it's all true.
[1:15:44.000 --> 1:15:46.000]  Okay, so this is real big boy stuff.
[1:15:46.000 --> 1:15:48.000]  Big boy pants time, okay?
[1:15:48.000 --> 1:15:50.000]  I've already told you about the New World Order.
[1:15:50.000 --> 1:15:51.000]  Everything was coming before.
[1:15:51.000 --> 1:15:52.000]  Now I'm going to tell you who's running it.
[1:15:52.000 --> 1:15:54.000]  When we come back, they don't want you to hear this.
[1:15:54.000 --> 1:16:20.000]  Stay with us.
[1:16:25.000 --> 1:16:29.000]  So please take action to declare independence from the New World Order
[1:16:29.000 --> 1:16:32.000]  by keeping the tip of the spear on air and getting great products
[1:16:32.000 --> 1:16:36.000]  at infowarsstore.com.
[1:16:36.000 --> 1:16:39.000]  I want to thank you all this July 4th for your continued fight for America
[1:16:39.000 --> 1:16:42.000]  and I would encourage you to join the fight even harder now
[1:16:42.000 --> 1:16:44.000]  because we're so close to winning.
[1:16:44.000 --> 1:16:50.000]  infowarsstore.com and celebrate July 4th, 1776, Part 2
[1:16:50.000 --> 1:16:53.000]  against the New World Order because the answer to 1984
[1:16:53.000 --> 1:16:57.000]  is 1776.
[1:17:24.000 --> 1:17:26.000]  The new film, the seminal film,
[1:17:26.000 --> 1:17:29.000]  the most important documentary ever made in my view,
[1:17:29.000 --> 1:17:33.000]  2000 Mules is now available on DVD with expanded extras

[1:17:49.000 --> 1:17:51.000]  If they're planning to run the same scams again,
[1:17:51.000 --> 1:17:54.000]  this film can stop them if you take action.
[1:17:54.000 --> 1:17:57.000]  infowarsstore.com, 2000 Mules.

[1:18:03.000 --> 1:18:07.000]  because it proves how the deep state stole the 2020 election
[1:18:07.000 --> 1:18:09.000]  and how they're planning to steal future elections
[1:18:09.000 --> 1:18:12.000]  and complete our journey to basically being like Venezuela.
[1:18:12.000 --> 1:18:15.000]  Now it's great that it's online and it's great that millions watch it online

[1:19:28.000 --> 1:19:30.000]  and all the things out there hurting everybody
[1:19:30.000 --> 1:19:34.000]  to be able to do things tax-wise that's legal and lawful
[1:19:34.000 --> 1:19:36.000]  that allows you to keep more of your money.
[1:19:36.000 --> 1:19:40.000]  We wouldn't even be here if I hadn't gotten great tax advice in the last few years.
[1:19:40.000 --> 1:19:44.000]  The only way you fail is not writing down the URL
[1:19:44.000 --> 1:19:48.000]  jonestaxrelief.com, one word, jonestaxrelief.com
[1:19:48.000 --> 1:19:55.000]  or call 833-904-285-833-904-285.
[1:20:18.000 --> 1:20:22.000]  You are listening to an infowars.com frontline report.
[1:20:22.000 --> 1:20:25.000]  It's Alex Jones.
[1:20:25.000 --> 1:20:28.000]  And it's Sunday, July 3rd, 2022.
[1:20:28.000 --> 1:20:30.000]  I'm your host Alex Jones.
[1:20:30.000 --> 1:20:33.000]  I'm just going to tell it like it is.
[1:20:33.000 --> 1:20:40.000]  I declare this July 4th, 2022 to be a declaration of independence
[1:20:40.000 --> 1:20:43.000]  against the alien force on this planet today,
[1:20:43.000 --> 1:20:46.000]  waging war against humans and our biology
[1:20:46.000 --> 1:20:50.000]  and our very future that is attempting to exterminate the majority of us
[1:20:50.000 --> 1:20:55.000]  and force the minority that's left to merge with AI computers
[1:20:55.000 --> 1:21:00.000]  and become cyborg slaves of Satan.
[1:21:00.000 --> 1:21:04.000]  Now, you've heard Elon Musk last year say beware billionaires
[1:21:04.000 --> 1:21:07.000]  that worship AI gods.
[1:21:07.000 --> 1:21:10.000]  And he tells you the global elite believe they're going to transcend humans
[1:21:10.000 --> 1:21:13.000]  and are going to create alien life forms, new life forms,
[1:21:13.000 --> 1:21:16.000]  the merger of humans and machines here on Earth
[1:21:16.000 --> 1:21:19.000]  and human animal hybrids merging with machines.
[1:21:19.000 --> 1:21:21.000]  That is alien.
[1:21:21.000 --> 1:21:29.000]  Received a DNA gene sequence in a radio transmission from deep space, hypothetically.
[1:21:29.000 --> 1:21:32.000]  And with now CRISPR gene editing systems,
[1:21:32.000 --> 1:21:36.000]  if scientists put together that new creature
[1:21:36.000 --> 1:21:41.000]  and then planted the embryo inside, say, a cow's uterus to grow it
[1:21:41.000 --> 1:21:43.000]  as they do humanoids now.
[1:21:43.000 --> 1:21:45.000]  That's already going on for decades.
[1:21:45.000 --> 1:21:48.000]  That would be an alien on this planet.
[1:21:48.000 --> 1:21:51.000]  So if it's aliens running this, I don't know.
[1:21:51.000 --> 1:21:55.000]  But the globalists setting this plan up are anti-human
[1:21:55.000 --> 1:22:00.000]  and say humans are obsolete, whether it's Uriah or Klaus Schwab or Bill Gates.
[1:22:00.000 --> 1:22:04.000]  And they're involved in a revolution or an update
[1:22:04.000 --> 1:22:07.000]  where you don't just get rid of your last phone, your last computer,
[1:22:07.000 --> 1:22:09.000]  or your last garage door opener.
[1:22:09.000 --> 1:22:11.000]  You get rid of humans themselves.
[1:22:11.000 --> 1:22:14.000]  And that's the anti-human revolution that's happening.
[1:22:14.000 --> 1:22:18.000]  With their carbon taxes, with their global surveillance,
[1:22:18.000 --> 1:22:21.000]  with their, quote, great reset to build back better,
[1:22:21.000 --> 1:22:25.000]  there'll be no humans, as we have known ourselves,
[1:22:25.000 --> 1:22:26.000]  at the end of this revolution.
[1:22:26.000 --> 1:22:27.000]  And that's all been announced.
[1:22:27.000 --> 1:22:29.000]  In the Wall Street Journal in the New York Times,
[1:22:29.000 --> 1:22:33.000]  looking forward to the end of humanity.
[1:22:33.000 --> 1:22:36.000]  Now, the Bible tells us it's a fallen entity
[1:22:36.000 --> 1:22:40.000]  manipulating us here on this planet to set up a world government,
[1:22:40.000 --> 1:22:43.000]  make us have a digital market of the beast to buy and sell,
[1:22:43.000 --> 1:22:45.000]  and that we'll have to give up our humanity in the process
[1:22:45.000 --> 1:22:47.000]  and give up our free will and our soul.
[1:22:47.000 --> 1:22:51.000]  That was said 2,000 years ago by John the Revelator on the Isle of Patmos.
[1:22:51.000 --> 1:22:55.000]  And it was also stated in Ezekiel in the Old Testament and Daniel.
[1:22:55.000 --> 1:22:58.000]  And so you can look at it any way you want,
[1:22:58.000 --> 1:23:04.000]  but the global social engineers, futurists,
[1:23:04.000 --> 1:23:09.000]  are following Revelation to a T.
[1:23:09.000 --> 1:23:12.000]  Absolutely following it to a T.
[1:23:12.000 --> 1:23:15.000]  And so whether it's saying a man can have a baby,
[1:23:15.000 --> 1:23:18.000]  or two women can have a baby,
[1:23:18.000 --> 1:23:20.000]  when it's a man and a woman in a prison,
[1:23:20.000 --> 1:23:23.000]  or the left saying, hey, love is love,
[1:23:23.000 --> 1:23:26.000]  let three-year-olds date 20-year-olds.
[1:23:26.000 --> 1:23:30.000]  All of this is about getting you to go against your own common sense,
[1:23:30.000 --> 1:23:31.000]  and the programming God gave you,
[1:23:31.000 --> 1:23:36.000]  and follow destructive practices known as sin.
[1:23:36.000 --> 1:23:38.000]  And you think of sin as cheating on your wife,
[1:23:38.000 --> 1:23:41.000]  or drinking too much alcohol, or cheating on your taxes,
[1:23:41.000 --> 1:23:43.000]  but that's low-level stuff.
[1:23:43.000 --> 1:23:48.000]  Real sin is going against your human code that God gave you.
[1:23:48.000 --> 1:23:50.000]  And that's where we are.
[1:23:50.000 --> 1:23:54.000]  More than 20 states have passed laws to use dead bodies for fuel,
[1:23:54.000 --> 1:23:56.000]  and dead bodies for fertilizer.
[1:23:56.000 --> 1:23:59.000]  All right, so I just did a few minutes on that.
[1:23:59.000 --> 1:24:02.000]  They took it out of context, and they're all over the news.
[1:24:02.000 --> 1:24:06.000]  On TV, rolling images of Independence Day
[1:24:06.000 --> 1:24:08.000]  with flying saucers over New York City,
[1:24:08.000 --> 1:24:13.000]  blowing up the Big Apple.
[1:24:13.000 --> 1:24:16.000]  So let me show you, and anybody watching this on TV,
[1:24:16.000 --> 1:24:18.000]  or anybody on the radio can record this.
[1:24:18.000 --> 1:24:20.000]  You can go look up every one of these articles,
[1:24:20.000 --> 1:24:23.000]  and you can see it for yourself what I was talking about.
[1:24:23.000 --> 1:24:25.000]  Here's one good place to start with,
[1:24:25.000 --> 1:24:27.000]  and this is the main religion of the globalists.
[1:24:27.000 --> 1:24:29.000]  Here's what they talk about.
[1:24:29.000 --> 1:24:31.000]  You know, we can play you countless table script clips.
[1:24:31.000 --> 1:24:34.000]  Looking forward to the end of humanity.
[1:24:34.000 --> 1:24:36.000]  COVID-19 shows us we're a failed species.
[1:24:36.000 --> 1:24:38.000]  We must merge with machines.
[1:24:38.000 --> 1:24:40.000]  Get rid of what we were and become a silicon.
[1:24:40.000 --> 1:24:42.000]  Wall Street Journal.
[1:24:42.000 --> 1:24:43.000]  NBC News.
[1:24:43.000 --> 1:24:45.000]  Cyborgs will replace humans and remake the world.
[1:24:45.000 --> 1:24:47.000]  James Lovelock says, NBC News says,
[1:24:47.000 --> 1:24:49.000]  soon there will be no more humans.
[1:24:49.000 --> 1:24:51.000]  Humans will be obsolete in the future.
[1:24:51.000 --> 1:24:53.000]  You will accept it.
[1:24:53.000 --> 1:24:56.000]  From human to cyborg, are you willing to augment your body?
[1:24:56.000 --> 1:24:58.000]  Why the future doesn't need us?
[1:24:58.000 --> 1:24:59.000]  Wired.
[1:24:59.000 --> 1:25:03.000]  Scientists create aliens as a scene at alien life form
[1:25:03.000 --> 1:25:05.000]  with artificial genetic code.
[1:25:05.000 --> 1:25:07.000]  That's what I was talking about.
[1:25:07.000 --> 1:25:10.000]  This is their revolution to rewrite not just humans,
[1:25:10.000 --> 1:25:12.000]  but the whole world.
[1:25:12.000 --> 1:25:15.000]  Scientists create the first life form with alien DNA.
[1:25:15.000 --> 1:25:17.000]  The Verge.
[1:25:17.000 --> 1:25:19.000]  National Geographic.
[1:25:19.000 --> 1:25:24.000]  Human pig hybrid created in the lab.
[1:25:24.000 --> 1:25:26.000]  Scientists help to come here.
[1:25:26.000 --> 1:25:30.000]  Embryos represent key steps for life-saving lab-grown organs.
[1:25:30.000 --> 1:25:33.000]  Oh, in decades after they had it, they told us about it.
[1:25:33.000 --> 1:25:38.000]  And now, the FDA set to approve human organs grown in pigs.
[1:25:38.000 --> 1:25:40.000]  Human animal hybrids.
[1:25:40.000 --> 1:25:42.000]  Can we justify the experiment?
[1:25:42.000 --> 1:25:44.000]  Science-focused.
[1:25:44.000 --> 1:25:48.000]  First, monkey human embryos reignite debate over hybrid animals.
[1:25:48.000 --> 1:25:53.000]  Last year, Congress wouldn't even pass a law to ban human animal hybrids.
[1:25:53.000 --> 1:25:57.000]  See, as Alex Jones looks so silly now.
[1:25:57.000 --> 1:26:00.000]  They're not coming and flying saucers, they're being made in labs.
[1:26:00.000 --> 1:26:02.000]  NASA will watch.
[1:26:02.000 --> 1:26:04.000]  New life forms discovered on the space station.
[1:26:04.000 --> 1:26:06.000]  NASA yawns in response.
[1:26:06.000 --> 1:26:12.000]  This article is key because it's got dozens of links in it
[1:26:12.000 --> 1:26:18.000]  to them announcing they created aliens with synthetic systems
[1:26:18.000 --> 1:26:21.000]  on the space stations in zero gravity.
[1:26:21.000 --> 1:26:25.000]  World's first living robots can now reproduce science to say.
[1:26:25.000 --> 1:26:28.000]  That can create a chain reaction, CNN.
[1:26:28.000 --> 1:26:35.000]  Robots made of cells blur the lines between creature and machine.
[1:26:35.000 --> 1:26:40.000]  Shadow biosphere might be hiding strange life right under our noses.
[1:26:40.000 --> 1:26:44.000]  Austin-based company wants you to eat cricket protein bars.
[1:26:44.000 --> 1:26:46.000]  KXAN.
[1:26:46.000 --> 1:26:49.000]  How much more protein there is in a cricket than in a cow.
[1:26:49.000 --> 1:26:51.000]  See, and you're like, that sounds crazy.
[1:26:51.000 --> 1:26:52.000]  You'll never do that.
[1:26:52.000 --> 1:26:53.000]  How alien is that everywhere?
[1:26:53.000 --> 1:26:55.000]  It's saying you will eat bugs.
[1:26:55.000 --> 1:26:59.000]  And Europe now banning cattle farming.
[1:26:59.000 --> 1:27:03.000]  Scientists create new life form in lab, altering the fundamentals of DNA,
[1:27:03.000 --> 1:27:05.000]  letting it independent.
[1:27:05.000 --> 1:27:10.000]  Thousands of new life forms discovered that redraw the tree of life.
[1:27:10.000 --> 1:27:15.000]  Working with robots, driving U.S. workers into depression, substance abuse report.
[1:27:15.000 --> 1:27:18.000]  The land where the Internet ends in West Virginia where the government allows
[1:27:18.000 --> 1:27:22.000]  no frequency transmissions where all the elite are secretly moving.
[1:27:22.000 --> 1:27:25.000]  New York Times.
[1:27:25.000 --> 1:27:28.000]  Gene editing experiment on human embryos went horribly wrong.
[1:27:28.000 --> 1:27:31.000]  Futurism.com.
[1:27:31.000 --> 1:27:33.000]  Web possibilities.
[1:27:33.000 --> 1:27:39.000]  Utah researcher uses goats to make one of the strongest known substances.
[1:27:39.000 --> 1:27:43.000]  Isn't even in the headline that the goats are part spider.
[1:27:43.000 --> 1:27:52.000]  Invisible quantum dot tattoo could be used for ID vaccinated kids.
[1:27:52.000 --> 1:27:58.000]  The birds and the bees will 5G also kill humanity.
[1:27:58.000 --> 1:28:01.000]  Elon Musk.
[1:28:01.000 --> 1:28:08.000]  Neuralink will do human brain implants.
[1:28:08.000 --> 1:28:17.000]  Everybody goes on and on and on what they're setting up.
[1:28:17.000 --> 1:28:23.000]  Here's another headline.
[1:28:23.000 --> 1:28:29.000]  Dealing with the future being humanless.
[1:28:29.000 --> 1:28:37.000]  The world's first humanless work, a model for the future.
[1:28:37.000 --> 1:28:42.000]  So when we talk about how they're building an anti-human world,
[1:28:42.000 --> 1:28:44.000]  they're telling you it's a post-human world.
[1:28:44.000 --> 1:28:47.000]  They're telling you run up the white flag and submit to it.
[1:28:47.000 --> 1:28:50.000]  All I'm saying is we should all have a serious debate about this and realize
[1:28:50.000 --> 1:28:52.000]  they're not taking us towards utopia.
[1:28:52.000 --> 1:28:55.000]  They are dropping us down a black hole of dystopia.
[1:28:55.000 --> 1:29:18.000]  We'll be right back.
[1:29:26.000 --> 1:29:29.000]  So please take action to declare independence from the New World Order

[1:32:59.000 --> 1:33:20.000]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[1:33:20.000 --> 1:33:24.000]  The Heights Public Library today debuting a new children's story hour
[1:33:24.000 --> 1:33:27.000]  called Drag Queen Storytime.
[1:33:27.000 --> 1:33:30.000]  My name is Blackberry, I'm a bearded drag queen.
[1:33:30.000 --> 1:33:33.000]  That means I'm a lady with lots of facial hair.
[1:33:33.000 --> 1:33:36.000]  I'm actually going to be one of the drag queens reading for Drag Queen Storytime.
[1:33:36.000 --> 1:33:38.000]  Drag Queen Storytime.
[1:33:38.000 --> 1:33:41.000]  And we have to warn you ladies and gentlemen, if you've got young or impressionable
[1:33:41.000 --> 1:33:45.000]  children in your household, bring them to the screen right now.
[1:33:45.000 --> 1:33:52.000]  And we witness parents taking their children as young as two inside to take part.
[1:33:52.000 --> 1:33:54.000]  Talking, singing and reading.
[1:33:54.000 --> 1:33:59.000]  We can both be grooms to an audience of preschoolers, toddlers and their caregivers.
[1:33:59.000 --> 1:34:03.000]  The hips on the drag queen go swish, swish, swish.
[1:34:03.000 --> 1:34:08.000]  Turn around and shake her butt, shake them, shake them, shake them, shake them.
[1:34:08.000 --> 1:34:11.000]  It was a first for this branch of the public library too.
[1:34:11.000 --> 1:34:12.000]  Are you nervous?
[1:34:12.000 --> 1:34:13.000]  Yes.
[1:34:13.000 --> 1:34:14.000]  Do you want to touch my hair?
[1:34:14.000 --> 1:34:15.000]  No.
[1:34:15.000 --> 1:34:18.000]  And for the children and the people that support it are going to realize
[1:34:18.000 --> 1:34:21.000]  that this is going to be the grooming of the next generation.
[1:34:21.000 --> 1:34:25.000]  That's the whole goal is to make kids that aren't used to seeing something like me
[1:34:25.000 --> 1:34:27.000]  more comfortable than seeing it.
[1:34:27.000 --> 1:34:30.000]  No one's there to push an agenda on anyone.
[1:34:30.000 --> 1:34:35.000]  No one's there to persuade people or to recruit people.
[1:34:35.000 --> 1:34:38.000]  Who wants to be a drag queen when they grow up?
[1:34:38.000 --> 1:34:40.000]  You could be a drag queen superhero.
[1:34:40.000 --> 1:34:41.000]  Pretty nervous.
[1:34:41.000 --> 1:34:42.000]  Yes.
[1:34:44.000 --> 1:34:45.000]  They were all accepting.
[1:34:45.000 --> 1:34:50.000]  They all were happy about it and excited and giving me hugs and everything.
[1:34:50.000 --> 1:34:52.000]  Everyone gets up on their table, spreads their legs.
[1:34:52.000 --> 1:34:53.000]  It's a man.
[1:34:53.000 --> 1:34:55.000]  This is adult entertainment.
[1:34:55.000 --> 1:34:58.000]  Most people seem to walk away having a good time.
[1:34:58.000 --> 1:34:59.000]  I start them young, right?
[1:34:59.000 --> 1:35:01.000]  I start them young, right?
[1:35:01.000 --> 1:35:03.000]  Anyone can do drag.
[1:35:03.000 --> 1:35:05.000]  Everyone can do drag.
[1:35:05.000 --> 1:35:06.000]  Everyone.
[1:35:06.000 --> 1:35:07.000]  Peace to children.
[1:35:07.000 --> 1:35:08.000]  Peace to children.
[1:35:08.000 --> 1:35:10.000]  I'm all about education.
[1:35:10.000 --> 1:35:13.000]  I actually do story time with drag queens in Chicago.
[1:35:13.000 --> 1:35:14.000]  Right?
[1:35:15.000 --> 1:35:16.000]  Yes.
[1:35:16.000 --> 1:35:18.000]  Family programming.
[1:35:18.000 --> 1:35:19.000]  Love it.
[1:35:19.000 --> 1:35:20.000]  Yes.
[1:35:20.000 --> 1:35:24.000]  We have just confirmed that a registered child sex offender has been reading to children
[1:35:24.000 --> 1:35:29.000]  at a Houston public library as part of its drag queen story hour.
[1:35:29.000 --> 1:35:34.000]  A media spokesperson for the library confirms one of those drag queens, Tatiana Malanina,
[1:35:34.000 --> 1:35:37.000]  is really Alberto Garza, a child sex offender.
[1:35:37.000 --> 1:35:41.000]  In 2008, he was convicted of assaulting an eight-year-old boy.
[1:35:41.000 --> 1:35:44.000]  This is Tatiana Malanina, my sister from Queens of the Week.
[1:35:44.000 --> 1:35:46.000]  What has this world come to?
[1:35:46.000 --> 1:35:48.000]  It's come to a world where drag kids actually exist.
[1:35:48.000 --> 1:35:50.000]  And people do ketamine on a couch.
[1:35:52.000 --> 1:35:54.000]  Desmond is the world's youngest club kid.
[1:35:54.000 --> 1:35:57.000]  And we challenge you, as the people out there, to find a younger club kid.
[1:35:57.000 --> 1:35:58.000]  Will they find one?
[1:35:58.000 --> 1:35:59.000]  No.
[1:35:59.000 --> 1:36:04.000]  Please welcome Desmond Naples, a.k.a. Desmond, is amazing!
[1:36:07.000 --> 1:36:08.000]  Yeah, have you been to a nightclub?
[1:36:08.000 --> 1:36:09.000]  No.
[1:36:09.000 --> 1:36:10.000]  No? Okay.
[1:36:10.000 --> 1:36:20.000]  Drag should be an all-agent thing, and some people consider it provocative.
[1:36:20.000 --> 1:36:22.000]  It's not inappropriate.
[1:36:36.000 --> 1:36:38.000]  Teach the children.
[1:36:38.000 --> 1:36:39.000]  Teach the children.
[1:36:39.000 --> 1:36:41.000]  I'm all about education.
[1:36:51.000 --> 1:36:54.000]  And everywhere else, it's called pedophilia.
[1:36:54.000 --> 1:36:56.000]  But when it's done institutionally,
[1:36:56.000 --> 1:37:01.000]  and they can get away with people dressed up like demon clowns with your children,
[1:37:01.000 --> 1:37:04.000]  pull up tranny time in the New York schools.
[1:37:04.000 --> 1:37:06.000]  This is put out in New York Times, like it's wonderful.
[1:37:06.000 --> 1:37:10.000]  And it's the biggest scary-looking group of weirdo pot-bellied men.
[1:37:10.000 --> 1:37:15.000]  Looks like a bunch of Dennis Hasterds running around with you clown makeup on,
[1:37:15.000 --> 1:37:19.000]  just hopping around, rubbing their giant bellies in front of children.
[1:37:19.000 --> 1:37:22.000]  And you're like, what alternate universe is this?
[1:37:22.000 --> 1:37:24.000]  What planet did I wake up in?
[1:37:28.000 --> 1:37:29.000]  Hi, ladies and gentlemen.
[1:37:29.000 --> 1:37:33.000]  And the reason I went to this news is we have some breaking news here.
[1:37:33.000 --> 1:37:37.000]  You know that top Biden administration official that runs the nuclear waste piles
[1:37:37.000 --> 1:37:40.000]  in the United States and the nuclear reactors?
[1:37:40.000 --> 1:37:44.000]  Top New Biden Stafford defended underage gay prostitution website
[1:37:44.000 --> 1:37:50.000]  raided by the feds in 2015 and defended sex with children.
[1:37:50.000 --> 1:37:52.000]  Isn't that a big surprise?
[1:37:52.000 --> 1:37:56.000]  Top Biden Stafford defended gay pedophilia prostitution website
[1:37:56.000 --> 1:37:59.000]  raided by the feds, infowars.com.
[1:37:59.000 --> 1:38:01.000]  Why?
[1:38:01.000 --> 1:38:03.000]  Am I not surprised?
[1:38:03.000 --> 1:38:04.000]  Here's another one.
[1:38:04.000 --> 1:38:08.000]  A Pennsylvania drag queen who counseled children.
[1:38:08.000 --> 1:38:13.000]  400-pound black man has been arrested and charged with 25 counseled child pornography.
[1:38:13.000 --> 1:38:17.000]  Why am I not surprised?
[1:38:17.000 --> 1:38:18.000]  And we have this video.
[1:38:18.000 --> 1:38:23.000]  Video of drag queen performing with little girls, horrified viewers.
[1:38:23.000 --> 1:38:28.000]  This is happening at malls now, at churches, in schools without parents being told in Denver,
[1:38:28.000 --> 1:38:32.000]  at libraries, a total invasion of men.
[1:38:32.000 --> 1:38:36.000]  Many of them convicted sex offenders, dressed up in clown outfits.
[1:38:36.000 --> 1:38:39.000]  Here's some of the latest footage.
[1:38:39.000 --> 1:38:57.000]  All right, for radio listeners,
[1:38:57.000 --> 1:39:00.000]  it is a man with giant artificial breasts,
[1:39:00.000 --> 1:39:05.000]  topless, with what looks like a three-year-old girl
[1:39:05.000 --> 1:39:11.000]  being led around while money is stuck in the
[1:39:14.000 --> 1:39:17.000]  thong panties.
[1:39:17.000 --> 1:39:20.000]  So, again, this is going on at bars.
[1:39:20.000 --> 1:39:22.000]  This is going on in schools.
[1:39:22.000 --> 1:39:25.000]  This is going on at shopping malls.
[1:39:25.000 --> 1:39:27.000]  We have footage at shopping malls.
[1:39:27.000 --> 1:39:30.000]  And this is literal scalp taking.
[1:39:30.000 --> 1:39:36.000]  This footage is a shopping mall of a child dancing on stage with one of these people.
[1:39:36.000 --> 1:39:39.000]  And it's like taking a scalp.
[1:39:39.000 --> 1:39:43.000]  It's the declaration of victory over humanity, over the children.
[1:39:43.000 --> 1:39:48.000]  And if they can parade around with a three-year-old girl at a sex bar
[1:39:48.000 --> 1:39:53.000]  with a man with giant fake breasts, with people sticking money in the G-strings,
[1:39:53.000 --> 1:39:56.000]  with men and women, with sickos.
[1:39:56.000 --> 1:40:01.000]  This is all pedophilic fetish, ruining their innocence, ruining their lives.
[1:40:01.000 --> 1:40:06.000]  They are simply marking their territory and declaring their victory over humanity.
[1:40:06.000 --> 1:40:11.000]  And are we surprised the person over all the nuclear waste in the United States
[1:40:11.000 --> 1:40:14.000]  is defending all of this?
[1:40:14.000 --> 1:40:20.000]  That is where we are in the year 2022.
[1:40:20.000 --> 1:40:29.000]  Can you imagine? At the current trajectory, they'll be having sex with children early next year on TV.
[1:40:29.000 --> 1:40:34.000]  Men dressed up like clowns saying that's what a woman looks like.
[1:40:34.000 --> 1:40:37.000]  Because children know to run from men, but not from women.
[1:40:37.000 --> 1:40:44.000]  These are predators. Big bad wolf dresses up like a woman, like grandma.
[1:40:44.000 --> 1:40:46.000]  And here it all is. All right.
[1:40:46.000 --> 1:40:49.000]  I want to talk about the inflation, how it's affecting you and your family,
[1:40:49.000 --> 1:40:54.000]  how you see it going, the great reset, how do we expose it, how do we rally to fight against it.
[1:40:54.000 --> 1:40:57.000]  And if you want to call in about this, you're welcome to as well.
[1:40:57.000 --> 1:41:00.000]  If you want to call in about how they're creating alien life forms
[1:41:00.000 --> 1:41:03.000]  and then creating black holes and all these new dangerous things,
[1:41:03.000 --> 1:41:06.000]  I'd like to hear about that as well. That's a huge topic area.

[1:41:15.000 --> 1:41:20.000]  for again, first-time callers.
[1:41:20.000 --> 1:41:23.000]  We have such a giant audience, most folks could ever get in.
[1:41:23.000 --> 1:41:25.000]  Please give first-time callers a chance.
[1:41:25.000 --> 1:41:28.000]  Plus, for free for all, open lines later this week as well for everybody.
[1:41:28.000 --> 1:41:31.000]  But 877-789-2539.

[1:43:05.000 --> 1:43:08.000]  And that's what people recognize and resonate with.
[1:43:08.000 --> 1:43:12.000]  And as Ward said, you're not going to find a better place for information.

[1:43:21.000 --> 1:43:24.000]  Infowarsstore.com, by the way, the products he mentions,
[1:43:24.000 --> 1:43:26.000]  Infowarsstore.com is where to get them, folks.
[1:43:26.000 --> 1:43:28.000]  And we do have the best supplements.
[1:43:28.000 --> 1:43:33.000]  I mean, just like we try our best with our news coverage and our information,
[1:43:33.000 --> 1:43:37.000]  we do the best with our supplements as well.
[1:43:37.000 --> 1:43:39.000]  I mean, look at the hair and beard support formula.
[1:43:39.000 --> 1:43:41.000]  Folks, this is a joke.

[1:43:44.000 --> 1:43:45.000]  By the way, it works for me.
[1:43:45.000 --> 1:43:50.000]  In case you haven't noticed, the hair and beard formula is working for me.
[1:43:50.000 --> 1:43:52.000]  Quite well, I might add.
[1:43:52.000 --> 1:43:56.000]  Quite well, my barber appreciates hair and beard support for men.
[1:43:56.000 --> 1:43:58.000]  I go and see them quite often now.
[1:43:58.000 --> 1:44:02.000]  Sleepless nights seem to be a lot more common these days
[1:44:02.000 --> 1:44:06.000]  with everything that's going on both at home and the world at large.
[1:44:06.000 --> 1:44:11.000]  If you're having trouble getting to that deep sleep we could all use more of,
[1:44:11.000 --> 1:44:15.000]  our new sleep support formula, Down and Out, is just the thing.
[1:44:15.000 --> 1:44:20.000]  It's our new faster-absorbing liquid formula that is specifically designed
[1:44:20.000 --> 1:44:22.000]  to help you get the shut-eye you deserve.
[1:44:22.000 --> 1:44:26.000]  Formulated to improve upon our best-selling product, Knockout,
[1:44:26.000 --> 1:44:30.000]  with Down and Out, now the herbs and melatonin packed inside
[1:44:30.000 --> 1:44:33.000]  are extracted directly into the glycerin solution.
[1:44:33.000 --> 1:44:38.000]  So the ingredients are already dissolved into the formula before you even take it.
[1:44:38.000 --> 1:44:42.000]  One of the other sleep support herbs included is the Passion Flower,
[1:44:42.000 --> 1:44:46.000]  which was traditionally used by Native Americans like the Cherokees,
[1:44:46.000 --> 1:44:48.000]  who used it for its relaxing qualities.
[1:44:48.000 --> 1:44:52.000]  Be sure to take this product when you are completely ready for sleep
[1:44:52.000 --> 1:44:55.000]  because you will be down and out.
[1:44:55.000 --> 1:44:59.000]  We're selling it out now at infowarstore.com.
[1:45:25.000 --> 1:45:28.000]  I actually buy this from the Mexican Rebels and I've been buying it for, what, 14 years
[1:45:28.000 --> 1:45:30.000]  and the price has never gone up.
[1:45:30.000 --> 1:45:33.000]  The same stuff sold at Whole Foods under another name for about 50% more,
[1:45:33.000 --> 1:45:36.000]  for a pound and I just think it's some of the best coffee you're going to find anywhere.
[1:45:36.000 --> 1:45:40.000]  It's Wake Up America, Patriot Blend from the Chiapas Rebels, literally.
[1:45:40.000 --> 1:45:43.000]  In fact, I'm not going to tell you a little story.
[1:45:43.000 --> 1:45:46.000]  We had like that.
[1:45:46.000 --> 1:45:48.000]  You wouldn't believe it.
[1:45:48.000 --> 1:45:52.000]  Anyway, so it's infowarstore.com and that's how we fund this operation
[1:45:52.000 --> 1:45:55.000]  and if you don't find us and don't want to stare, that's fine.
[1:45:58.000 --> 1:46:00.000]  Look at that.
[1:46:00.000 --> 1:46:03.000]  Everybody else is just like yellow or clear and that's because it's been denatured.
[1:46:03.000 --> 1:46:06.000]  It's been worked out. We didn't do that.
[1:46:06.000 --> 1:46:11.000]  You think I would metaphysically tell you something that is the very best I can get?
[1:46:11.000 --> 1:46:13.000]  I'd rather go to hell and do that.
[1:46:13.000 --> 1:46:19.000]  I will only give you the maximum best info, the maximum truth, the maximum product
[1:46:19.000 --> 1:46:22.000]  because I want that good will.
[1:46:22.000 --> 1:46:24.000]  What I do to you, I do to myself.
[1:46:24.000 --> 1:46:26.000]  Don't you get the big secret?
[1:46:26.000 --> 1:46:28.000]  You ever seen fish oil look like that?
[1:46:28.000 --> 1:46:30.000]  No, you never seen that, have you?
[1:46:30.000 --> 1:46:38.000]  And this little jewel right here is solid, liquid consciousness.
[1:46:41.000 --> 1:46:42.000]  Look it up.
[1:46:42.000 --> 1:46:48.000]  Find out how even the FDA and the government admit that fish oil is incredible.
[1:46:48.000 --> 1:46:53.000]  The number one thing anybody can do for themselves is take the fish oil or krill oil
[1:46:53.000 --> 1:46:57.000]  just like our information is dynamite, so are our products in forestore.com.
[1:46:59.000 --> 1:47:05.000]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[1:47:05.000 --> 1:47:08.000]  Alex Jones.
[1:47:15.000 --> 1:47:19.000]  There's a lot of controversy around this network about Alex Jones, for example.
[1:47:23.000 --> 1:47:27.000]  Alex Jones, the foray conspiracy theorist who was a parent.
[1:47:27.000 --> 1:47:29.000]  Alex Jones.
[1:47:34.000 --> 1:47:36.000]  Alex Jones.
[1:47:44.000 --> 1:47:46.000]  Until war comes to mind.
[1:47:49.000 --> 1:47:51.000]  Reputation is amazing.
[1:47:51.000 --> 1:47:53.000]  I will not let you down.
[1:47:53.000 --> 1:47:57.000]  I will be very, very impressed, I hope.
[1:48:01.000 --> 1:48:03.000]  Well, they've just had a press conference.
[1:48:03.000 --> 1:48:10.000]  We're getting the video for you the next hour up in Highland Park, Illinois,
[1:48:10.000 --> 1:48:15.000]  where a psychotic shot and killed six people into another 60.
[1:48:15.000 --> 1:48:18.000]  We saw photos and videos of him dressed like a woman.
[1:48:18.000 --> 1:48:22.000]  They said the press conference he was dressed like a woman when they captured him.
[1:48:22.000 --> 1:48:24.000]  We're starting to figure this out yet, folks.
[1:48:24.000 --> 1:48:28.000]  This is like Mars attacks where the alien comes in and it's dressed like a woman
[1:48:28.000 --> 1:48:30.000]  when it tries to kill her by the White House.
[1:48:30.000 --> 1:48:32.000]  It's their camouflage, ladies and gentlemen.
[1:48:32.000 --> 1:48:39.000]  When I say alien, I mean alien to humanity, alien to the future, alien to everything we stand for as humans.
[1:48:39.000 --> 1:48:43.000]  All right, I want to go to your phone calls right now.
[1:48:43.000 --> 1:48:48.000]  And I got a lot of the news haven't hit yet, but we're going to go to your phone calls.
[1:48:48.000 --> 1:48:52.000]  Christian and John and Paul and Greg and Leroy and so many others.
[1:48:52.000 --> 1:49:00.000]  Up first, ladies and gentlemen, holding the longest would be a caller in North Carolina.
[1:49:00.000 --> 1:49:03.000]  And that would be Christian. Welcome, Christian.
[1:49:03.000 --> 1:49:05.000]  Yes, sir. How are you today?
[1:49:05.000 --> 1:49:08.000]  Man, I'm in the middle of the New World Order, just like you, brother. It is crazy.
[1:49:08.000 --> 1:49:11.000]  I always wonder what it would be like. We're in it now.
[1:49:11.000 --> 1:49:15.000]  I'll tell you what, I'm 34-year-old and I've got two little girls
[1:49:15.000 --> 1:49:20.000]  and I never thought I'd see the world go down the drain like it has, you know, 10 years ago.
[1:49:20.000 --> 1:49:23.000]  And now, every day, it's something else.
[1:49:23.000 --> 1:49:28.000]  All me and my wife do now is we go to work or we go to the store, we come home,
[1:49:28.000 --> 1:49:30.000]  can't even afford to go nowhere anymore.
[1:49:30.000 --> 1:49:35.000]  And in every bit of money we get now, we're stalking up, we're stalking up, we're stalking up.
[1:49:35.000 --> 1:49:39.000]  And then you see all the evil going on
[1:49:39.000 --> 1:49:44.000]  and how these parents are letting their kids get around this drag queen pedophile deal.
[1:49:44.000 --> 1:49:49.000]  And people still just go back their day like nothing's going on.
[1:49:49.000 --> 1:49:51.000]  And I want to be clear. I want to be clear.
[1:49:51.000 --> 1:49:53.000]  People think of me as big and rich. I'm not.
[1:49:53.000 --> 1:49:57.000]  If I was, I'd be fine. If it wasn't ill-gotten.
[1:49:57.000 --> 1:50:00.000]  Being wealthy, you help people's good, but we're not.
[1:50:00.000 --> 1:50:03.000]  People think like, oh, Alex Jones must be immune from this.
[1:50:03.000 --> 1:50:08.000]  We're looking at our five-year-old daughter, just turned five, at going to a Christian private school.
[1:50:08.000 --> 1:50:11.000]  We looked at one of the most supposed, biggest, best, that used to be conservative.
[1:50:11.000 --> 1:50:16.000]  They now teach daddies, two daddies, two monies, drag queen pedophile time
[1:50:16.000 --> 1:50:21.000]  at the biggest Christian school with thousands of pupils in Austin.
[1:50:21.000 --> 1:50:24.000]  This stuff is everywhere. You could only home school.
[1:50:24.000 --> 1:50:27.000]  And you're absolutely right. Speaking on inflation,
[1:50:27.000 --> 1:50:31.000]  we can't even with supply chain breakdowns get the products we need to sell them to keep on air
[1:50:31.000 --> 1:50:34.000]  because we don't have sponsors overall. We have to sell fund.
[1:50:34.000 --> 1:50:40.000]  So I hear your brother and it's rough, but in a way it's a silver lining driving people out of the system
[1:50:40.000 --> 1:50:43.000]  because the big corporations, all of it is so corrupt now.
[1:50:43.000 --> 1:50:46.000]  The movies, Hollywood, all of it's so poisonous.
[1:50:46.000 --> 1:50:49.000]  It's kind of a blessing to pull out of the system.
[1:50:49.000 --> 1:50:52.000]  Yes, sir. And I think about my grandpa told me stories.
[1:50:52.000 --> 1:50:55.000]  He grew up in the depression, everything like that.
[1:50:55.000 --> 1:50:59.000]  And when he finally got to be able to be, do what he needs to do
[1:50:59.000 --> 1:51:02.000]  and have money and everything, how much he appreciated that.
[1:51:02.000 --> 1:51:05.000]  And the way I see things going now, that's what's going to take again.
[1:51:05.000 --> 1:51:07.000]  People really need a big kick in the butt.
[1:51:07.000 --> 1:51:12.000]  God bless you and I appreciate your call. I'll tell a story and then go back to calls.
[1:51:12.000 --> 1:51:18.000]  In East Texas, where my dad's mother and father, both families were wealthy,
[1:51:18.000 --> 1:51:21.000]  successful landowners and business owners.
[1:51:21.000 --> 1:51:24.000]  They kept their land, but they had nothing at the end of the depression.
[1:51:24.000 --> 1:51:26.000]  And they had to take care of everybody else.
[1:51:26.000 --> 1:51:34.000]  And by the end of the depression over 10 years, there wasn't a squirrel or a deer or a possum to eat.
[1:51:34.000 --> 1:51:39.000]  And my dad's parents ate possums, folks, and they had thousands of acres
[1:51:39.000 --> 1:51:42.000]  and land and businesses and everything.
[1:51:42.000 --> 1:51:45.000]  And they lost everything with their land at the end of that.
[1:51:45.000 --> 1:51:48.000]  And they helped and fed and took care of folks.
[1:51:48.000 --> 1:51:51.000]  It's true story. I don't tell it to virtue signal.
[1:51:51.000 --> 1:51:53.000]  I'd be like six, seven, eight years old.
[1:51:53.000 --> 1:51:55.000]  They all died by the time I was a 10 or 11.
[1:51:55.000 --> 1:51:58.000]  And Thanksgiving would come.
[1:51:58.000 --> 1:52:06.000]  And there'd be a line of cars at our ranch house with poor black people
[1:52:06.000 --> 1:52:11.000]  and poor white people bringing pies to my grandmother and grandfather
[1:52:11.000 --> 1:52:17.000]  because their parents had fed them and slaughtered their hogs and cattle and everything.
[1:52:17.000 --> 1:52:19.000]  I mean, they had nothing at the end of it.
[1:52:19.000 --> 1:52:23.000]  There was literally almost all the animals were dead.
[1:52:23.000 --> 1:52:26.000]  Just like North Korea, they say you don't see a grasshopper.
[1:52:26.000 --> 1:52:30.000]  You don't see a lizard. You don't see a bird because the people ate everything.
[1:52:30.000 --> 1:52:32.000]  And at the end of 10 years of that great depression,
[1:52:32.000 --> 1:52:35.000]  which happened in the 20s into the early 30s,
[1:52:35.000 --> 1:52:39.000]  decades later in the late 1970s, when I'm a little kid,
[1:52:39.000 --> 1:52:42.000]  I was like, this is ridiculous. It'd be like 15 pies.
[1:52:42.000 --> 1:52:45.000]  And you had to take them. My grandmother would try to refuse them.
[1:52:45.000 --> 1:52:48.000]  There'd be 15 pies, turkeys, food everywhere.
[1:52:48.000 --> 1:52:51.000]  And my grandmother would then go give it to poor people
[1:52:51.000 --> 1:52:55.000]  because there was a line, mainly black folks, but some poor white people,
[1:52:55.000 --> 1:53:02.000]  50 years later, bringing them food because they gave them food when they were children.
[1:53:02.000 --> 1:53:05.000]  Now, that's where this country's headed, ladies and gentlemen.
[1:53:05.000 --> 1:53:09.000]  And that's where we are right now.
[1:53:09.000 --> 1:53:12.000]  Whew, blows me away.
[1:53:12.000 --> 1:53:15.000]  I had never seen anything like that in my life.
[1:53:15.000 --> 1:53:20.000]  I mean, there'd be three cars at once in their little dirt driveway.
[1:53:20.000 --> 1:53:23.000]  People crying, giving them food at the door
[1:53:23.000 --> 1:53:26.000]  because they killed every damn animal they had.
[1:53:26.000 --> 1:53:29.000]  Thousands of cows, thousands of chickens.
[1:53:29.000 --> 1:53:34.000]  They had everything, huge facilities, barns all over the place, money, everything.
[1:53:34.000 --> 1:53:37.000]  They gave every bit of it up to feed people during that.
[1:53:37.000 --> 1:53:39.000]  And we don't have people like that now.
[1:53:39.000 --> 1:53:43.000]  And when the stuff goes down, ladies and gentlemen, you better be ready
[1:53:43.000 --> 1:53:45.000]  because it's going to be hell.
[1:53:45.000 --> 1:53:49.000]  I get chills thinking about it.
[1:53:49.000 --> 1:53:51.000]  My grandfather was also the county tax assessor
[1:53:51.000 --> 1:53:53.000]  and wouldn't let him take poor people's land.
[1:53:53.000 --> 1:53:55.000]  That was another reason for him, but it's insane.
[1:53:55.000 --> 1:53:57.000]  Talk about Robin Hood.
[1:53:57.000 --> 1:54:00.000]  And I grew up thinking, this is what your family's like.
[1:54:00.000 --> 1:54:03.000]  Badasses, amazing people, war heroes.
[1:54:03.000 --> 1:54:05.000]  All super good looking.
[1:54:05.000 --> 1:54:07.000]  We're like movie stars.
[1:54:07.000 --> 1:54:10.000]  I look at people now and I'm like, what the hell happened to us, man?
[1:54:10.000 --> 1:54:12.000]  Satan happened to us. That's what happened.
[1:54:12.000 --> 1:54:15.000]  And yeah, I'm talking about my family because it's all true.
[1:54:15.000 --> 1:54:20.000]  And I feel sorry for all the scum attacking us that you don't come from a family like mine.
[1:54:20.000 --> 1:54:25.000]  You have no idea what you've conjured and what you're bringing on yourselves.
[1:54:25.000 --> 1:54:27.000]  But let me tell you, we'll win in the end.
[1:54:27.000 --> 1:54:29.000]  You can be guaranteed of that.
[1:54:29.000 --> 1:54:32.000]  All right, let's take another call here.
[1:54:32.000 --> 1:54:36.000]  Let's talk to a caller in Florida. Let's talk to Paul on live insurance companies,
[1:54:36.000 --> 1:54:39.000]  the future of finances and this whole collapse. Go ahead.
[1:54:39.000 --> 1:54:42.000]  God bless you, angel from above.
[1:54:42.000 --> 1:54:44.000]  You are amazing.
[1:54:44.000 --> 1:54:46.000]  I love you, brother. You're amazing. Go ahead.
[1:54:46.000 --> 1:54:49.000]  I knew this back early on after Obama won the second election.
[1:54:49.000 --> 1:54:52.000]  So I cashed in everything and started doing my crazy stuff.
[1:54:52.000 --> 1:54:58.000]  So people thought, but started listening to you and you put it all together.
[1:54:58.000 --> 1:55:03.000]  My question is with all the stuff going on, you don't hear anything from the insurance industry,
[1:55:03.000 --> 1:55:11.000]  because they got to be paying off all these debt policies or how do they fit into it?
[1:55:11.000 --> 1:55:13.000]  You're absolutely right, brother.
[1:55:13.000 --> 1:55:16.000]  Well, they're going to have debt forgiveness for us getting us into debt.
[1:55:16.000 --> 1:55:20.000]  They'll have it for the big banks, but they'll have a new digital global system
[1:55:20.000 --> 1:55:23.000]  that if we sign on to it with a social credit score, then they'll forgive us.
[1:55:23.000 --> 1:55:25.000]  That's their embedded plan.
[1:55:25.000 --> 1:55:28.000]  God bless you. I'm telling you.
[1:55:28.000 --> 1:55:34.000]  I love the fact that you're online and you still listen to your show. That's beautiful.
[1:55:34.000 --> 1:55:36.000]  We'll just spread the word, brother. We can't do it without you, Paul.
[1:55:36.000 --> 1:55:37.000]  I love you too.
[1:55:37.000 --> 1:55:39.000]  All right, let's take another call here.
[1:55:39.000 --> 1:55:44.000]  Let's talk to John in Minnesota. John, you're on here. Welcome.
[1:55:44.000 --> 1:55:50.000]  Hey, Alex, just before I say my topic, I'd just like to say I wish I could work for you.
[1:55:50.000 --> 1:55:52.000]  I'd be a perfect candidate.
[1:55:52.000 --> 1:55:55.000]  I wish I had the money to pay more people. I love you, brother. Go ahead.
[1:55:55.000 --> 1:55:57.000]  It's not even about the money.
[1:55:57.000 --> 1:56:00.000]  No, I get it. You want to fight. You want to fight.
[1:56:00.000 --> 1:56:03.000]  Yeah, and I'm single and I have a great mind.
[1:56:03.000 --> 1:56:05.000]  Let me just say this. Let me just say this.
[1:56:05.000 --> 1:56:12.000]  We are not, you would not work for me. We work together and you do work for Info Wars and I work for you.
[1:56:12.000 --> 1:56:18.000]  This is information warfare. You don't need to be officially signed up here to be part of the fight, brother.
[1:56:18.000 --> 1:56:23.000]  Oh, I know, but I'm only a couple of days older than you in life.
[1:56:23.000 --> 1:56:28.000]  I was born on January 30th, 74, and I feel a weird connection to you.
[1:56:28.000 --> 1:56:34.000]  I'm just a bit different style than you, obviously, but I think we agree on a lot.
[1:56:34.000 --> 1:56:39.000]  But anyway, I just want to say, you know, the Republicans are being stupid,
[1:56:39.000 --> 1:56:42.000]  and they were in 2019 and 20 and they're stupid.
[1:56:42.000 --> 1:56:49.000]  Now if they don't just take that video clip, Joe Biden did about 30 some years ago,
[1:56:49.000 --> 1:56:54.000]  sitting on a stage in front of a crowd saying that when he was a young senator,
[1:56:54.000 --> 1:56:58.000]  he tried to prostitute himself to the largest donors and they said,
[1:56:58.000 --> 1:57:00.000]  come back when you're 40, young man.
[1:57:00.000 --> 1:57:06.000]  Well, he's 80 almost. And I mean, how much prostitution has he done in the last 50 years?
[1:57:06.000 --> 1:57:11.000]  You know, like, that's a clip right there that says every Democrat
[1:57:11.000 --> 1:57:14.000]  can't run with that commercial being played every year.
[1:57:14.000 --> 1:57:19.000]  I agree. The Republican leadership is like a rig boxing match.
[1:57:19.000 --> 1:57:23.000]  They are taken to dive. They're part of the same structure, and that's our biggest problem.
[1:57:23.000 --> 1:57:25.000]  That's why they're so scared of Trump and all of us.
[1:57:25.000 --> 1:57:29.000]  A populist movement taking over the Republican Party. We're very close to victory.
[1:57:29.000 --> 1:57:33.000]  Thank you so much, brother. That's why they're throwing everything they got at us. Thank you, John.
[1:57:33.000 --> 1:57:37.000]  Our number three is only two minutes away and I'm coming out of this break
[1:57:37.000 --> 1:57:39.000]  and I'm going right to your phone calls.
[1:57:39.000 --> 1:58:07.000]  Leroy, DC, Phil, Jason, Leith, Maria, Greg, Maria, you're up next.
[1:58:07.000 --> 1:58:12.000]  This is the biggest sale yet of the year. Some of these products were selling at below cost.
[1:58:12.000 --> 1:58:16.000]  You've got to move them out of the warehouse and be able to continue to stay on the air.
[1:58:16.000 --> 1:58:19.000]  So please take action to declare independence from the New World Order
[1:58:19.000 --> 1:58:26.000]  by keeping the tip of the spear on air and getting great products at infowarstore.com.
[1:58:26.000 --> 1:58:30.000]  I want to thank you all this July 4th for your continued fight for America,
[1:58:30.000 --> 1:58:34.000]  and I would encourage you to join the fight even harder now because we're so close to winning.
[1:58:34.000 --> 1:58:42.000]  Again, infowarstore.com and celebrate July 4th, 1776, Part Two, against the New World Order
[1:58:42.000 --> 1:58:48.000]  because the answer to 1984 is 1776.
[1:58:48.000 --> 1:58:53.000]  Ganesha Suze's new film, 2000 Mules, is the most important documentary in modern times
[1:58:53.000 --> 1:58:57.000]  because it proves how the deep state stole the 2020 election
[1:58:57.000 --> 1:58:59.000]  and how they're planning to steal future elections
[1:58:59.000 --> 1:59:02.000]  and complete our journey to basically being like Venezuela.
[1:59:02.000 --> 1:59:05.000]  Now, it's great that it's online, it's great that millions watch online,
[1:59:05.000 --> 1:59:10.000]  but you need to have the high quality AG DVD in your library with the expanded extras

[1:59:51.000 --> 1:59:56.000]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[1:59:56.000 --> 2:00:00.000]  What you have to do is check out what I'm saying
[2:00:00.000 --> 2:00:07.000]  and that's why they run the fake headline against myself and Tucker Carlson everywhere, every day.
[2:00:07.000 --> 2:00:13.000]  Jones admits he's an actor or Tucker Carlson says nobody would take me seriously.
[2:00:13.000 --> 2:00:18.000]  Where do we say that? We never said that, they just say we said that.
[2:00:18.000 --> 2:00:23.000]  But where's the clip? Where's the article? Where do we say that? It doesn't exist.
[2:00:23.000 --> 2:00:27.000]  Alex Jones is playing a character and is a performance artist.
[2:00:27.000 --> 2:00:30.000]  Jones is playing a character on his radio show.
[2:00:30.000 --> 2:00:34.000]  The radio rants of Alex Jones just an act.
[2:00:34.000 --> 2:00:38.000]  He's actually a performance artist. He's a performance artist.
[2:00:38.000 --> 2:00:40.000]  Alex Jones is a fake.
[2:00:40.000 --> 2:00:44.000]  They're lying to you because they think you're stupid
[2:00:44.000 --> 2:00:49.000]  and it's all based on the custody battle of my ex-wife five years ago
[2:00:49.000 --> 2:00:54.000]  and she was trying to put into evidence to be dressed up more than a decade before like the Joker
[2:00:54.000 --> 2:01:00.000]  being sarcastic saying take your Prozac kids, take your illegal drugs too, you'll die, it's fun
[2:01:00.000 --> 2:01:04.000]  so people wouldn't take drugs and they wanted to enter that in evidence.
[2:01:04.000 --> 2:01:08.000]  They look, he's insane telling kids to use drugs and my lawyer went,
[2:01:08.000 --> 2:01:13.000]  when Jack Nicholson plays the part of the Joker, no one thinks that's really Jack Nicholson.
[2:01:13.000 --> 2:01:18.000]  So yeah, when I've been Cobra Commander or Optimus Prime.
[2:01:18.000 --> 2:01:20.000]  Autobots, let's roll.
[2:01:20.000 --> 2:01:23.000]  Or the Joker, because I can do imitations of them all really good.
[2:01:23.000 --> 2:01:24.000]  Or Darth Vader.
[2:01:24.000 --> 2:01:27.000]  Don't act so surprised, globalist.
[2:01:27.000 --> 2:01:31.000]  You didn't think you could silence the American people, did you?
[2:01:31.000 --> 2:01:33.000]  Do I really think I'm Darth Vader?
[2:01:33.000 --> 2:01:34.000]  No.
[2:01:34.000 --> 2:01:37.000]  Do I think I'm Optimus Prime, Cobra Commander, the Joker?
[2:01:37.000 --> 2:01:38.000]  No.
[2:01:38.000 --> 2:01:42.000]  And clearly no reasonable person would think when I'm doing satire
[2:01:42.000 --> 2:01:45.000]  that what I'm saying is what I really think.
[2:01:45.000 --> 2:01:50.000]  No one believes the Babylon Bee, it's not trying to lie to you, it's being sarcastic.
[2:01:50.000 --> 2:01:52.000]  By the vaccinate me Elmo doll today.
[2:01:52.000 --> 2:01:54.000]  It's required by the CDC.
[2:01:54.000 --> 2:01:56.000]  But they play those games.
[2:01:56.000 --> 2:01:59.000]  And that's why I don't joke around as much as I used to.
[2:01:59.000 --> 2:02:02.000]  Even though I tell people, okay, this is a joke, this isn't serious.
[2:02:02.000 --> 2:02:08.000]  They clip it out and they say, no, this is what he really believes.
[2:02:08.000 --> 2:02:10.000]  Every day when I leave work, I do this.
[2:02:10.000 --> 2:02:12.000]  That man's threatened this country.
[2:02:12.000 --> 2:02:15.000]  So look, he admitted in court, he's an actor.
[2:02:15.000 --> 2:02:17.000]  Well, yeah, I was an actor in Scanner Darkly.
[2:02:17.000 --> 2:02:19.000]  I was an actor in Waking Life.
[2:02:19.000 --> 2:02:23.000]  I was an actor when I was Cobra Commander.
[2:02:23.000 --> 2:02:29.000]  But it doesn't mean that Alex Jones, the talk show host, up here reading news articles to you,
[2:02:29.000 --> 2:02:32.000]  isn't a real thing and isn't something I'm actually saying.
[2:02:32.000 --> 2:02:33.000]  And you know that.
[2:02:33.000 --> 2:02:36.000]  You're insulted right now, I'm even explaining that to you.
[2:02:36.000 --> 2:02:41.000]  And so am I, but that's who these people are.
[2:02:41.000 --> 2:02:45.000]  You don't know the power of the dark side.
[2:02:45.000 --> 2:02:48.000]  Am I really Darth Vader?
[2:02:48.000 --> 2:02:50.000]  I think Alex Jones seems really talented.
[2:02:50.000 --> 2:02:51.000]  He's smart.
[2:02:51.000 --> 2:02:52.000]  He's funny as hell.
[2:02:52.000 --> 2:02:54.000]  He's truly funny.
[2:02:54.000 --> 2:02:56.000]  I'm kind of retarded.
[2:03:03.000 --> 2:03:08.000]  Now that I've done those imitations, those little jokes,
[2:03:08.000 --> 2:03:13.000]  do you now not listen to what I say about other things when I show you a powerful news article
[2:03:13.000 --> 2:03:15.000]  by Dr. Joseph Mercola on infowars.com.
[2:03:15.000 --> 2:03:17.000]  It has all the cited information.
[2:03:17.000 --> 2:03:20.000]  The latest tragedy, sudden adult death syndrome.
[2:03:20.000 --> 2:03:22.000]  No, that's a real thing.
[2:03:22.000 --> 2:03:25.000]  That's something happening in the real world.
[2:03:25.000 --> 2:03:26.000]  Alex Jones is a crisis actor.
[2:03:26.000 --> 2:03:27.000]  It's the name of the video.
[2:03:27.000 --> 2:03:28.000]  It's Amanda, a video.
[2:03:28.000 --> 2:03:30.000]  We're going to go to break.
[2:03:30.000 --> 2:03:31.000]  We're going to come back with your calls.
[2:03:31.000 --> 2:03:33.000]  But I promise you, we get to this.
[2:03:33.000 --> 2:03:35.000]  We have the video of the press conference.
[2:03:35.000 --> 2:03:36.000]  We're going to try to suppress.
[2:03:36.000 --> 2:03:40.000]  We're going to hear a few minutes of it when we come back in the next segment.
[2:03:40.000 --> 2:03:42.000]  And then we are going to go to your calls.
[2:03:42.000 --> 2:03:49.000]  But breaking, police reveal Highland Park suspect were women's clothing during attack.
[2:03:49.000 --> 2:03:52.000]  And he did a lot of weird leftist stuff in his actual videos.
[2:03:52.000 --> 2:03:54.000]  Then he draped himself in a Trump flag.
[2:03:54.000 --> 2:03:55.000]  Obviously a false flag.
[2:03:55.000 --> 2:03:57.000]  We're going to be going over that.
[2:03:57.000 --> 2:03:58.000]  We got that press conference.
[2:03:58.000 --> 2:04:02.000]  The system, believe me, does not want this information out.
[2:04:02.000 --> 2:04:04.000]  This is only going to be on local news.
[2:04:04.000 --> 2:04:05.000]  They don't want this anywhere else.
[2:04:05.000 --> 2:04:07.000]  This is coming up next segment.
[2:04:07.000 --> 2:04:10.000]  And then Leroy, you're up first.
[2:04:10.000 --> 2:04:13.000]  So don't hang up Leroy and then Greg and then Marie.
[2:04:13.000 --> 2:04:16.000]  Taking calls, the order they are received.
[2:04:16.000 --> 2:04:17.000]  Then Phil.
[2:04:17.000 --> 2:04:23.000]  And right down the list, everybody else, Jason in Texas and so many others, your calls are coming up.
[2:04:23.000 --> 2:04:30.000]  But wow, you see who's susceptible to the brainwashing, the transgenderism, the mass shooting.
[2:04:30.000 --> 2:04:38.000]  It's these people who've lost their soul and become robots of this evil spirit that so many have warned about that we're now witnessing.
[2:04:38.000 --> 2:04:42.000]  So your calls are all coming up and so much more.
[2:04:42.000 --> 2:04:46.000]  Band.video has all of our videos and so many other censored videos.
[2:04:46.000 --> 2:04:47.000]  You need to share it.

[2:06:07.000 --> 2:06:11.000]  Resistance to Titans is obedience to God.
[2:06:11.000 --> 2:06:15.000]  It's Alex Jones.
[2:06:15.000 --> 2:06:21.000]  But we do believe Cremo pre-planned this attack for several weeks.
[2:06:21.000 --> 2:06:24.000]  He brought a high-powered rifle to this parade.
[2:06:24.000 --> 2:06:29.000]  He accessed the roof of a business via a fire escape ladder
[2:06:29.000 --> 2:06:34.000]  and began opening fire on the Innocent Independence Day celebration goers.
[2:06:34.000 --> 2:06:39.000]  The rifle was purchased in Illinois and the information we have thus far
[2:06:39.000 --> 2:06:44.000]  is that it appears to have been purchased legally by Cremo.
[2:06:44.000 --> 2:06:48.000]  During the attack, Cremo was dressed in women's clothing
[2:06:48.000 --> 2:06:53.000]  and investigators do believe he did this to conceal his facial tattoos and his identity
[2:06:53.000 --> 2:06:59.000]  and help him during the escape with the other people who were fleeing the chaos.
[2:06:59.000 --> 2:07:03.000]  During the attack, we believe that Cremo fired more than 70 rounds
[2:07:03.000 --> 2:07:06.000]  from this rifle into the crowd of innocent people.
[2:07:06.000 --> 2:07:09.000]  Following the attack, Cremo exited the roof.
[2:07:09.000 --> 2:07:13.000]  He dropped his rifle and he blended in with the crowd and he escaped.
[2:07:13.000 --> 2:07:17.000]  He walked to his mother's home who lived in the area
[2:07:17.000 --> 2:07:20.000]  and he blended right in with everybody else as they were running around
[2:07:20.000 --> 2:07:24.000]  almost as he was an innocent spectator as well.
[2:07:24.000 --> 2:07:26.000]  He borrowed his mother's vehicle.
[2:07:26.000 --> 2:07:29.000]  We issued an alert yesterday afternoon.
[2:07:29.000 --> 2:07:33.000]  Chief Jogman provided the vehicle information and Cremo's information.
[2:07:33.000 --> 2:07:36.000]  We're very thankful that an alert member of the community
[2:07:36.000 --> 2:07:41.000]  saw Cremo's vehicle traveling southbound on Route 41, dialed 911
[2:07:41.000 --> 2:07:45.000]  and alert North Chicago police officer, spotted the vehicle,
[2:07:45.000 --> 2:07:49.000]  waited for additional backup units to arrive, conducted a traffic stop
[2:07:49.000 --> 2:07:54.000]  and they were able to safely apprehend Cremo with no injuries to the officers.
[2:07:54.000 --> 2:07:58.000]  Inside the vehicle, there was a second rifle located.
[2:07:58.000 --> 2:08:01.000]  Indications is that was purchased by Cremo as well.
[2:08:01.000 --> 2:08:05.000]  Thus far, over 30 people were injured during the attack
[2:08:05.000 --> 2:08:08.000]  and this does not include the six who lost their lives.
[2:08:08.000 --> 2:08:12.000]  Right now, Cremo remains in custody at this time.
[2:08:12.000 --> 2:08:16.000]  There are no indications that there was anybody else involved in this attack.
[2:08:16.000 --> 2:08:19.000]  By all indications, it appears Cremo was acting by himself.
[2:08:19.000 --> 2:08:23.000]  The Lake County State's Attorney's Office has been with us from the ground level.
[2:08:23.000 --> 2:08:26.000]  They're with us this morning. They were with us through the night.
[2:08:26.000 --> 2:08:28.000]  We continue to review the information.
[2:08:28.000 --> 2:08:33.000]  Investigators are still developing leads and very critical information.
[2:08:33.000 --> 2:08:37.000]  Once we're at a point where we're ready to review all of that information for charges,
[2:08:37.000 --> 2:08:41.000]  we will sit down with the state's attorney and review for criminal charges.
[2:08:41.000 --> 2:08:46.000]  Before YouTube took down his 20-plus videos I watched last night,
[2:08:46.000 --> 2:08:49.000]  at least five or six of them, he dressed as a woman.
[2:08:49.000 --> 2:08:52.000]  So now he dressed as a woman to...
[2:08:52.000 --> 2:08:54.000]  How does that even know?
[2:08:54.000 --> 2:09:00.000]  He was drinking the New World Order Kool-Aid, 110%.
[2:09:00.000 --> 2:09:03.000]  And so look for him to cover that up as well.
[2:09:03.000 --> 2:09:05.000]  All right, we're taking your phone calls.
[2:09:05.000 --> 2:09:10.000]  Leroy in Texas talking about inflation, the globalist making their move.
[2:09:10.000 --> 2:09:13.000]  What's your view on all this?
[2:09:13.000 --> 2:09:14.000]  Howdy, Mr. Jones.
[2:09:14.000 --> 2:09:16.000]  Yes, sir.
[2:09:16.000 --> 2:09:18.000]  Thank you for taking my call.
[2:09:18.000 --> 2:09:23.000]  Well, first of all, thanks for all the products you've got.
[2:09:23.000 --> 2:09:26.000]  I've got Alexa Breeze in all my rooms.
[2:09:26.000 --> 2:09:29.000]  And my wife, she gets a little upset when it's not running.
[2:09:29.000 --> 2:09:32.000]  So she's kind of used to that now.
[2:09:32.000 --> 2:09:34.000]  Thanks for keeping us on here.
[2:09:34.000 --> 2:09:35.000]  Yes, sir.
[2:09:35.000 --> 2:09:39.000]  So I guess the one thing I want to bring up is...
[2:09:39.000 --> 2:09:41.000]  Excuse me.
[2:09:41.000 --> 2:09:44.000]  Have you ever heard of Jonathan Kleck?
[2:09:44.000 --> 2:09:46.000]  No.
[2:09:46.000 --> 2:09:47.000]  Yeah, you haven't.
[2:09:47.000 --> 2:09:49.000]  Well, he's right there in San Antonio.
[2:09:49.000 --> 2:09:53.000]  And he's got a line on all this stuff.
[2:09:53.000 --> 2:09:56.000]  And I got to tell you, he's really helped me.
[2:09:56.000 --> 2:10:00.000]  I listened to you during the day and I listened to him at night.
[2:10:00.000 --> 2:10:04.000]  Here's his name. Jonathan, quick or click?
[2:10:04.000 --> 2:10:06.000]  Click.
[2:10:06.000 --> 2:10:07.000]  Click.
[2:10:07.000 --> 2:10:09.000]  His name means Jonathan Kleck.
[2:10:09.000 --> 2:10:12.000]  Yahweh has given a bell ringer.
[2:10:12.000 --> 2:10:22.000]  So he's got the explanation for all this transgender and all this alien.
[2:10:22.000 --> 2:10:27.000]  It's all Bible fact.
[2:10:27.000 --> 2:10:31.000]  So he kind of deciphered, he's got the unrolled scroll, I guess.
[2:10:31.000 --> 2:10:32.000]  I'm going to look it up, brother.
[2:10:32.000 --> 2:10:33.000]  I'm going to look it up.
[2:10:33.000 --> 2:10:35.000]  What else is on your mind?
[2:10:35.000 --> 2:10:40.000]  Well, I guess just being able to talk to you, it's nice stuff.
[2:10:40.000 --> 2:10:46.000]  Hopefully you can get him online because you've got like salty cracker on there
[2:10:46.000 --> 2:10:50.000]  and all the other guys and he'd be a great addition.
[2:10:50.000 --> 2:10:51.000]  If you've got here...
[2:10:51.000 --> 2:10:52.000]  There are a bunch of other guests who want to get on, sir.
[2:10:52.000 --> 2:10:54.000]  Thank you so much, Leroy.
[2:10:54.000 --> 2:10:57.000]  All right, up next, Jason in Texas.
[2:10:57.000 --> 2:11:00.000]  Jason, you're on the air worldwide.
[2:11:00.000 --> 2:11:02.000]  Alex, thanks for taking my call.
[2:11:02.000 --> 2:11:04.000]  I'm going to be straight to the point.
[2:11:04.000 --> 2:11:09.000]  The elites are spitting in our face with predictive programming.
[2:11:09.000 --> 2:11:14.000]  The new Jurassic Park Dominion movie specifically talks about
[2:11:14.000 --> 2:11:20.000]  genetically modified locusts, huge, huge genetically modified locusts
[2:11:20.000 --> 2:11:26.000]  eating up all the farmland and not eating the genetically modified crops.
[2:11:26.000 --> 2:11:31.000]  In the movie, it specifically says that they're going to have a worldwide famine
[2:11:31.000 --> 2:11:32.000]  that'll kill millions.
[2:11:32.000 --> 2:11:38.000]  Sure, they only eat the normal crops, so we were forced to eat the GMO crops to sterilize us.
[2:11:38.000 --> 2:11:40.000]  Yep.
[2:11:40.000 --> 2:11:45.000]  And if I could make a suggestion, it'd be great if you would make a VPN service
[2:11:45.000 --> 2:11:47.000]  so we could protect our internet.
[2:11:47.000 --> 2:11:49.000]  We know you wouldn't sell out.
[2:11:49.000 --> 2:11:52.000]  Well, there's a thousand things we need to do, brother, but I hear you.
[2:11:52.000 --> 2:11:57.000]  What else do you think's going to happen during this scorched earth and new older policy?
[2:11:57.000 --> 2:11:58.000]  There's no telling.
[2:11:58.000 --> 2:12:00.000]  I feel like there's a big war coming.
[2:12:00.000 --> 2:12:01.000]  The war is already here.
[2:12:01.000 --> 2:12:04.000]  There's an economic war to collapse us and bring us to our knees.
[2:12:04.000 --> 2:12:06.000]  Thank you so much, Jason.
[2:12:06.000 --> 2:12:08.000]  Let's talk to Greg in Iowa.
[2:12:08.000 --> 2:12:09.000]  Greg, you're on the air.
[2:12:09.000 --> 2:12:10.000]  Go ahead, Greg.
[2:12:10.000 --> 2:12:17.000]  Yeah, I wanted to talk about CERN and without going down a rabbit hole.
[2:12:17.000 --> 2:12:20.000]  CERN, they're not just creating biological aliens.
[2:12:20.000 --> 2:12:23.000]  They're creating black holes, strange little things to destroy the planet.
[2:12:23.000 --> 2:12:26.000]  Here's BBC Today, and it says,
[2:12:26.000 --> 2:12:32.000]  scientists find new exotic configurations of quarks, so they've turned CERN back on.
[2:12:32.000 --> 2:12:39.000]  Yeah, I've been doing a lot of research on that, and it's not real readily available
[2:12:39.000 --> 2:12:41.000]  because they don't want to let it all out of the bag.
[2:12:41.000 --> 2:12:46.000]  But what they're looking for is what they've actually captured already is antimatter.
[2:12:46.000 --> 2:12:50.000]  Basically, when God created everything, he created light and darkness,
[2:12:50.000 --> 2:12:53.000]  and it's a balance that he created.
[2:12:53.000 --> 2:12:55.000]  I mean, there's a reason he put the snake in the garden.
[2:12:55.000 --> 2:12:59.000]  He didn't have to, but he did because he wanted us to have that choice.
[2:12:59.000 --> 2:13:05.000]  And so he created antimatter and matter, and the matter that we know, you know, everything...
[2:13:05.000 --> 2:13:08.000]  Don't you love how CERN's symbol is three-sixes?
[2:13:08.000 --> 2:13:09.000]  What?
[2:13:09.000 --> 2:13:12.000]  Don't you love how CERN's symbol is three-sixes?
[2:13:12.000 --> 2:13:13.000]  Put it back on the screen.
[2:13:13.000 --> 2:13:16.000]  Oh, yeah, in the Satanic... I mean, they've got Apollo...
[2:13:16.000 --> 2:13:20.000]  I mean, you could go on and on about how demonic it is,
[2:13:20.000 --> 2:13:26.000]  but they're trying to bring this antimatter into our realm
[2:13:26.000 --> 2:13:33.000]  so that it corrupts our matter as we know it.
[2:13:33.000 --> 2:13:35.000]  Like, if you have a log that's held together, right,
[2:13:35.000 --> 2:13:38.000]  it's controlled, it's held together until you light it on fire,
[2:13:38.000 --> 2:13:40.000]  and then it burns uncontrollably.
[2:13:40.000 --> 2:13:46.000]  But antimatter is the log already on fire, and it needs to be contained.
[2:13:46.000 --> 2:13:51.000]  It's like the opposite force of everything that we know is good.
[2:13:51.000 --> 2:13:59.000]  And by them trying to bring this into our realm,
[2:13:59.000 --> 2:14:09.000]  their hope is that it will disrupt all of the stable matter that we have in this realm.
[2:14:09.000 --> 2:14:12.000]  And with that, darkness is tied to that.
[2:14:12.000 --> 2:14:14.000]  You know, all your demonic, your evil...
[2:14:14.000 --> 2:14:18.000]  Well, it's just like Stephen King, who's definitely one of them's dark tower series.
[2:14:18.000 --> 2:14:21.000]  The Red King Satan wants to bring down reality,
[2:14:21.000 --> 2:14:27.000]  though he's waging war with any matter to destroy everything as he hates God.
[2:14:27.000 --> 2:14:33.000]  It's very biblical, and if you just, I mean, study the Bible
[2:14:33.000 --> 2:14:38.000]  and what they're doing, I mean, it clears today what's going on.
[2:14:38.000 --> 2:14:41.000]  Waging war against the pillars of reality.
[2:14:41.000 --> 2:14:43.000]  I appreciate your call, God bless you.
[2:14:43.000 --> 2:14:46.000]  All right, more phone calls coming up.
[2:14:46.000 --> 2:14:49.000]  They have a special guest joining us, who's the lawyer involved
[2:14:49.000 --> 2:14:52.000]  with these big announcements that are being made, and it's in the news now.
[2:14:52.000 --> 2:14:55.000]  We told you about it yesterday, but it's in the news now.
[2:14:55.000 --> 2:14:58.000]  Texas counties declare invasion at southern border,
[2:14:58.000 --> 2:15:02.000]  and so much more coming up with that guest.
[2:15:02.000 --> 2:15:04.000]  But we're going to come back and take your phone calls,
[2:15:04.000 --> 2:15:09.000]  and then after that, your phone calls as well here on this live Tuesday,
[2:15:09.000 --> 2:15:11.000]  July 5th, worldwide broadcast.
[2:15:11.000 --> 2:15:14.000]  And listen, I want to thank you all for your support.
[2:15:14.000 --> 2:15:16.000]  We have the July 4th special running right now.
[2:15:16.000 --> 2:15:20.000]  The biggest ever, we have to sell out of everything we've got to stay on air,
[2:15:20.000 --> 2:15:22.000]  which are great products you need.
[2:15:22.000 --> 2:15:28.000]  X2, the pear and beard formula that is really a multi-vitamin mineral, 75% off.
[2:15:28.000 --> 2:15:33.000]  All these products are available at infowarstore.com, infowarstore.com,
[2:15:33.000 --> 2:15:38.000]  vitamin D3 gummies, alpha power, the great coffee, fish oil, krill oil.
[2:15:38.000 --> 2:15:41.000]  So much more is at infowarstore.com.
[2:15:41.000 --> 2:15:43.000]  The vaso beats, so good for your heart.
[2:15:43.000 --> 2:15:45.000]  infowarstore.com, I need your help.
[2:15:45.000 --> 2:15:48.000]  I don't have George Soros, I have you, and I need your help.
[2:15:48.000 --> 2:15:51.000]  These are great products, just take action, it's a winner.
[2:15:51.000 --> 2:15:57.000]  infowarstore.com, and everything we do is an expression of your support.
[2:15:57.000 --> 2:16:03.000]  There is nothing, there is no more epitome of free speech than right here.
[2:16:03.000 --> 2:16:07.000]  And that's what people recognize and resonate with.
[2:16:07.000 --> 2:16:11.000]  And as Ward said, you're not going to find a better place for information.
[2:16:11.000 --> 2:16:14.000]  You might not agree with everything, you might not agree with all our perspectives,
[2:16:14.000 --> 2:16:16.000]  but we cover all the information.
[2:16:16.000 --> 2:16:19.000]  And there's nowhere else really that does it like we do here.
[2:16:19.000 --> 2:16:20.000]  Thank you for that, Ward.
[2:16:20.000 --> 2:16:23.000]  infowarstore.com, by the way, the products he mentions,
[2:16:23.000 --> 2:16:27.000]  infowarstore.com is where to get them, folks, and we do have the best supplements.
[2:16:27.000 --> 2:16:32.000]  I mean, just like we try our best with our news coverage and our information,
[2:16:32.000 --> 2:16:36.000]  we do the best with our supplements as well.
[2:16:36.000 --> 2:16:40.000]  I mean, look at the hair and beard support formula, folks, this is a joke.
[2:16:40.000 --> 2:16:42.000]  I mean, we're giving this thing away, it's 75% off.
[2:16:42.000 --> 2:16:45.000]  By the way, it works for me, and in case you haven't noticed,
[2:16:45.000 --> 2:16:49.000]  the hair and beard formula is working for me.
[2:16:49.000 --> 2:16:55.000]  Whitewell, I might add. Whitewell, my barber appreciates hair and beard support for men.
[2:16:55.000 --> 2:16:57.000]  I go and see him quite often now.
[2:16:57.000 --> 2:17:02.000]  The first ten amendments to our country's constitution were adopted in 1791.
[2:17:02.000 --> 2:17:07.000]  The first of these broadly protects the rights of free speech and free press.
[2:17:07.000 --> 2:17:11.000]  Free speech means the free and public expression of opinions
[2:17:11.000 --> 2:17:16.000]  without censorship, interference, and restraint by the government.
[2:17:16.000 --> 2:17:23.000]  231 years later, free speech across America is under chronic and insidious attack.
[2:17:23.000 --> 2:17:25.000]  GCN is under attack.
[2:17:25.000 --> 2:17:30.000]  Your freedom is currently under siege from those who do not want you to know the truth.
[2:17:30.000 --> 2:17:36.000]  I'm asking our fellow broadcasters and you to rise up and help us defend our right
[2:17:36.000 --> 2:17:38.000]  to continue telling you the truth.
[2:17:38.000 --> 2:17:40.000]  Would you like to join us?
[2:17:40.000 --> 2:17:45.000]  If so, please consider visiting savegcn.com.
[2:17:45.000 --> 2:17:50.000]  You may click follow, share, give, and pray.
[2:17:50.000 --> 2:17:52.000]  You may select all of those choices.
[2:17:52.000 --> 2:17:54.000]  I'm Vincent Finnelli.
[2:17:54.000 --> 2:17:57.000]  I want to say Brain Force is great.
[2:17:57.000 --> 2:17:59.000]  I want to say Turbo Force is amazing.
[2:17:59.000 --> 2:18:00.000]  It is.
[2:18:00.000 --> 2:18:05.000]  But if you took it with fish oil, it's like the fish oil is it.
[2:18:05.000 --> 2:18:06.000]  The fish oil is better than that.
[2:18:06.000 --> 2:18:08.000]  And that's an example of what I'm talking about.
[2:18:08.000 --> 2:18:15.000]  Fish oil is liquid energy, brain, body, heart, the cleanest, the best out there.
[2:18:15.000 --> 2:18:18.000]  Crayol oils is the best and it'll give you the damn burps.
[2:18:18.000 --> 2:18:19.000]  And I'm just sorry.
[2:18:19.000 --> 2:18:21.000]  You want something like this, you don't get stuff for free.
[2:18:21.000 --> 2:18:23.000]  The Crayol is hallucinogenic.
[2:18:23.000 --> 2:18:24.000]  It's so good.
[2:18:24.000 --> 2:18:25.000]  In my view.
[2:18:25.000 --> 2:18:27.000]  I'm not a medical statement here, but let me tell you something.
[2:18:27.000 --> 2:18:29.000]  I eat five caplets of Crayol oil before I go to bed.
[2:18:29.000 --> 2:18:32.000]  I'm seeing Santa Claus that night.
[2:18:32.000 --> 2:18:35.000]  So your brain is the best.
[2:18:35.000 --> 2:18:42.000]  So your brain is made basically out of what fish oil is.
[2:18:42.000 --> 2:18:46.000]  So we don't make a big profit off of it.
[2:18:46.000 --> 2:18:47.000]  But you know what?
[2:18:47.000 --> 2:18:50.000]  I just obsessed because whatever the best is we've got, I just can't lie to you.
[2:18:50.000 --> 2:18:51.000]  I just can't do it.
[2:18:51.000 --> 2:19:16.000]  I just can't do it.
[2:19:16.000 --> 2:19:23.000]  We sold food for three months because there was a wait.
[2:19:23.000 --> 2:19:25.000]  Now there is not a wait.
[2:19:25.000 --> 2:19:28.000]  Almost every other storeable food distributor is completely out and will not have more food for months if ever.
[2:19:28.000 --> 2:19:31.000]  And the prices are exploding.
[2:19:31.000 --> 2:19:36.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, now is the time to protect yourself and your family and not be dependent on the system.
[2:19:36.000 --> 2:19:38.000]  The time to be self-sufficient is now.
[2:19:38.000 --> 2:19:41.000]  We have the best deals of high-quality storeable food
[2:19:41.000 --> 2:19:44.000]  and a whole spectrum of other preparedness and survival items right now
[2:19:44.000 --> 2:20:04.160]  of the new world order, it's Alex Jones.
[2:20:14.000 --> 2:20:27.120]  Shitter Jennings bringing us in to the Alex Jones show, Summer of Rage.
[2:20:27.120 --> 2:20:39.120]  Chaos is hanging around, a tree to the ground, shut her from sight.
[2:20:39.120 --> 2:20:45.120]  The death machine ain't slowing down, it's gaining power.
[2:20:45.120 --> 2:20:50.120]  You know, we've gotten used to being surveilled by big tech and then censored and then lied about.
[2:20:50.120 --> 2:20:56.120]  To being silent so they could lie about us and misrepresent what we said and done, that's the worst part.
[2:20:56.120 --> 2:21:03.120]  But boy do they know how to turn the knife and put salt in the wound and piss in our faces.
[2:21:03.120 --> 2:21:11.120]  Big story about Don Salazar is up on infowars.com, you fight back against these monsters by sharing this article right now.
[2:21:11.120 --> 2:21:20.120]  Twitter suspended Dr. Zalinko's foundation that he launched two days before he died, a day after his death.
[2:21:20.120 --> 2:21:28.120]  They put a foundation up there, well the lies of Fauci and all the lies of Big Pharma,
[2:21:28.120 --> 2:21:34.120]  they suspended videos of him off of Twitter the day after he died.
[2:21:34.120 --> 2:21:41.120]  That's who these killers are. Aiding and abetting Big Pharma is Big Tech, it's one of the same.
[2:21:41.120 --> 2:21:48.120]  But they won't suppress Dr. Zalinko, they won't suppress you, they won't suppress me as long as we have the fighting spirit.
[2:21:48.120 --> 2:21:53.120]  And Dr. Zalinko is alive with God now, the next level.
[2:21:53.120 --> 2:21:59.120]  We live together in the future as well, because we don't submit.
[2:21:59.120 --> 2:22:09.120]  The Freedom Foundation accounts suspended, doesn't that say at all? You don't get medical freedom, we control your bodies.
[2:22:09.120 --> 2:22:12.120]  Alright, taking calls, the order they are received.
[2:22:12.120 --> 2:22:22.120]  Mike, excuse me, not Mike, Marie, my eyes are going out. Marie in New York, go ahead.
[2:22:22.120 --> 2:22:27.120]  Hi Marie, you welcome to the show. Marie is gone.
[2:22:27.120 --> 2:22:38.120]  Alright, up next here in the order received would be a caller in South Dakota, DC in South Dakota, go ahead.
[2:22:38.120 --> 2:22:44.120]  Hey Jones, I got three main points I want to make, one about Mount Rushmore, Grump and Flack.
[2:22:44.120 --> 2:22:52.120]  First, Mount Rushmore, related to cultural warfare. If you look at Mount Rushmore, we have the founding fathers, Jefferson, so on and so forth.
[2:22:52.120 --> 2:23:05.120]  You're right now putting up a crazy horse, a monument, a crazy horse, its own monument who was at the time scalping the 7th Calvary when we fought in that region.
[2:23:05.120 --> 2:23:09.120]  It's a cultural war and the left is winning the cultural war.
[2:23:09.120 --> 2:23:15.120]  And this is how I think Trump coming in 2024 needs to get his game straight.
[2:23:15.120 --> 2:23:27.120]  So when Obama was running for a second election, all the marijuana festivals, these big leftists, not necessarily leftists, but definitely left leaning marijuana convention, so on and so forth.
[2:23:27.120 --> 2:23:33.120]  They had Obama printed on thousands and thousands of marijuana rolling.
[2:23:33.120 --> 2:23:36.120]  And then he didn't legalize marijuana, remember that?
[2:23:36.120 --> 2:23:45.120]  Yeah, and then he didn't do nothing, but you know what it did is it allowed that single item group of people to vote on one issue to get their vote.
[2:23:45.120 --> 2:23:50.120]  And then they were so stoned, they forgot about it, and they voted for whoever, again, that promised the marijuana.
[2:23:50.120 --> 2:24:00.120]  What I'm saying is Trump needs to get on this topic. That's how he's going to get elected. That single item, the guns, the abortion, you're not changing anybody's opinion.
[2:24:00.120 --> 2:24:09.120]  That's a single issue that everybody, I think, that's a single issue voter will say, I'm voting Trump because he's going to do this.
[2:24:09.120 --> 2:24:17.120]  Appreciate your call, brother. Thank you, DC. Let's talk to FEMA Region 5 caller. Let's talk to Phil. Phil, you're on the air. Go ahead.
[2:24:17.120 --> 2:24:29.120]  Hey, Alex. First time caller. Totally appreciate what you do. Listen, 12 years ago, I was driving down the street, about a half a block down the street, and there was a mailbox, and it said 9-11 was an inside job.
[2:24:29.120 --> 2:24:37.120]  And infowars.com. And that was 12 years ago, and that woke me up. And ever since then, I've been watching everything you've done.
[2:24:37.120 --> 2:24:48.120]  I've got you in the studio where I work every day. The thing is, is that man put that sticker on that mailbox for a reason.
[2:24:48.120 --> 2:24:56.120]  And it woke me up. And it also took me 12 years to kind of get the balls to go down there and introduce myself.
[2:24:56.120 --> 2:25:04.120]  You know, it's kind of a weird situation. And I mean, this is a neighbor. It's not a city block. It's a rural block.
[2:25:04.120 --> 2:25:17.120]  And long story short, Dr. Sev died on Thursday, and it was the 4th of July weekend. And I said, this is the time.
[2:25:17.120 --> 2:25:21.120]  I'm going to go down and introduce myself. Got the balls, went down there, banged on the door.
[2:25:21.120 --> 2:25:27.120]  And I probably said the most old man thing I could probably ever say in my life at 48 years old, young girl into the door.
[2:25:27.120 --> 2:25:34.120]  And I said, hello, is your dad home? And dude comes to the door and I said, hey, my name's Phil. I've lived down the street.
[2:25:34.120 --> 2:25:42.120]  And your mailbox woke me up 12 years ago, and I want to thank you for that. And he lit up like it was the 4th of July.
[2:25:42.120 --> 2:25:51.120]  And we had a few words and he said, thank you. And I said, no, thank you. My life has changed 12 years ago because of that sticker on that mailbox.
[2:25:51.120 --> 2:25:59.120]  And flash forward to Saturday, still 4th of July weekend, and my wife and I are sitting on the porch.
[2:25:59.120 --> 2:26:12.120]  And here comes my neighbor with an armful of stuff. And he came over with a stack of Info Wars t-shirts and DVDs.
[2:26:12.120 --> 2:26:18.120]  And we both said the same thing on both days. If you need anything, you let me know.
[2:26:18.120 --> 2:26:29.120]  And come to find out, he, you know, knew some people that I went to high school with. Daughter plays a game that I'm an illustrator for. So I said, hold on.
[2:26:29.120 --> 2:26:36.120]  So I gave him a bunch of prints to give to his daughter, signed a number and everything that I did.
[2:26:36.120 --> 2:26:45.120]  And I just want to say thank you because you're not just putting on information. You are bringing people together.
[2:26:45.120 --> 2:26:57.120]  And this is a neighbor, not even 200, 300 feet down the street, dude, that I would have never met 12 years ago if it wasn't for that bumper sticker.
[2:26:57.120 --> 2:27:04.120]  Brother, you don't think me. I want to thank Phil and I want to thank your neighbor. That's what this is about, the power of human intelligence.
[2:27:04.120 --> 2:27:08.120]  We don't care about AI. We don't care about brainwashing. We care about human connection.
[2:27:08.120 --> 2:27:13.120]  And if we all just take action and connect, it's game over for the new world order. So thank you so much.
[2:27:13.120 --> 2:27:16.120]  Folks, keep fighting hard. It's beautiful what you did.
[2:27:16.120 --> 2:27:22.120]  All right. We don't have time to jam another caller right now. We have a special guest joining us.
[2:27:22.120 --> 2:27:29.120]  Texas counties and cities are declaring their own emergency. Tens of thousands dead. The emergency is exploding.
[2:27:29.120 --> 2:27:35.120]  Tractor trailer is full of dead people. We're going to talk about it when we come back on the other side.
[2:27:35.120 --> 2:27:43.120]  Then after our guest leaves this, I will get to Lath and everybody else, but no more calls. They keep loading the phones.
[2:27:43.120 --> 2:27:48.120]  I'm going to get to everybody that's on the board here and then we got to end it because I've got a guest host coming up,
[2:27:48.120 --> 2:27:53.120]  but I really want to talk to all of you and I appreciate you all. This is going to be amazing.

[2:28:20.120 --> 2:28:25.120]  The fact that we are just right there where we need to be right at the moment of destruction.

[2:32:01.120 --> 2:32:02.120]  Hello, Alex. Yes, Malcolm.
[2:32:02.120 --> 2:32:06.120]  Alright, I will make this quick and real short where the other patrons can get on the line.
[2:32:06.120 --> 2:32:11.120]  Alex, I have to promote one thing from one of your co-hosts, Owen Schreuer.
[2:32:11.120 --> 2:32:17.120]  Supermal vitality and brain force plus. Mix those two together. You're an unstoppable tank.
[2:32:17.120 --> 2:32:23.120]  Supermal vitality really, really works. It's cold pressed herbs and natural compounds that have never been heated up
[2:32:23.120 --> 2:32:30.120]  and so it has a dramatic effect compared to powdered versions that also work quite well but just aren't as strong.
[2:32:30.120 --> 2:32:36.120]  This is like a very fine wine. In fact, each batch is different. Sometimes it's super strong, sometimes it's just okay.
[2:32:36.120 --> 2:32:40.120]  People are like, why are you selling something and admitting sometimes the batch isn't as strong?
[2:32:40.120 --> 2:32:46.120]  That's just how it is. It's how it works. So it's always good. It's just sometimes it's like super strong.
[2:32:46.120 --> 2:32:53.120]  But yeah, if you want the Rolls Royce at a decent price, then this is it.
[2:33:16.120 --> 2:33:18.120]  Thanks, Jones.
[2:33:47.120 --> 2:34:01.120]  Well, the United Nations came out yesterday and said officially that the Texas-Mexico border is the most deadly border in the world.
[2:34:01.120 --> 2:34:09.120]  Tens of thousands dead a year, 53 dead in a tractor trailer last week, almost no coverage compared to mass shootings.
[2:34:09.120 --> 2:34:19.120]  Jonathan Hulahan is a great lawyer and a patriot practicing in Texas and New Mexico who has been spearheading county citizens defending freedom.
[2:34:19.120 --> 2:34:28.120]  And at 3 p.m. today, it's been covered by a lot of Texas TV stations. We'll be covering it here with Owen Shroyer in the war room coming up at 3 p.m. Central.
[2:34:28.120 --> 2:34:35.120]  And this is an incredible time right now to be alive because the border is completely failed. There is an invasion.
[2:34:35.120 --> 2:34:41.120]  They're trying to get the governor to declare an emergency, which he should have already done, trying to pressure Biden into taking action.
[2:34:41.120 --> 2:34:46.120]  Here's some of the headlines. Texas counties declare invasion at southern border today.
[2:34:46.120 --> 2:34:54.120]  So to give us a first look is Jonathan Hulahan. Jonathan, thank you so much for joining us today, sir. Good job with the work you're doing.
[2:34:54.120 --> 2:35:03.120]  Thanks, Alex. I really appreciate the opportunity to come on and get this issue out there in the media so people understand what's actually happening at the southern border.
[2:35:03.120 --> 2:35:12.120]  It is an invasion. We're talking about human smuggling, trafficking, sex trafficking, fentanyl, opioids, guns.
[2:35:12.120 --> 2:35:22.120]  You name it, it's an invasion across our border. And I think the state of Texas and all states have a duty and obligation to their citizens to stand up and protect their citizens and their property.
[2:35:22.120 --> 2:35:37.120]  And if it's not happening at the state level, we see what Kenny County is doing, declaring a state of emergency and getting those trying to get the visibility on it so they can declare an invasion and force the state to act.
[2:35:37.120 --> 2:35:43.120]  You have been the tip of the spear on this organizing this. A lot of folks told me to have you on. I appreciate you coming on. Tell us you're down there.
[2:35:43.120 --> 2:35:54.120]  What you're witnessing, we're already in an emergency. It should be declared and what you're expecting to come out of this. What all of us need to do today to make sure this press conference has a lot of attention?
[2:35:54.120 --> 2:36:07.120]  Well, just to be clear, I'm not the one actually organizing it. I have a lot of friends and relationships in there and I know Sheriff Coe and the county attorney and they're really pushing this from the government level.
[2:36:07.120 --> 2:36:15.120]  I'm just giving supporting fires where I can trying to get the message out. So so they deserve all the credit for organizing this and getting the word out.
[2:36:15.120 --> 2:36:17.120]  Okay, great. What's happening?
[2:36:17.120 --> 2:36:25.120]  So what's happening is the county. We saw Sheriff Coe last week. He was he received four legal aliens from Border Patrol.
[2:36:25.120 --> 2:36:41.120]  They said, hey, go get these guys down to to medical haven't cleared and then and then and then release them. Sheriff Coe being who Sheriff Coe is. He's a constitutional sheriff's decided I'm not going to release felons or criminals in the United States because I have.
[2:36:41.120 --> 2:36:51.120]  I have I have citizens I have to protect and he actually ran a check on him. One of the illegals he found had a was a sex offender registered out of New Jersey.
[2:36:51.120 --> 2:36:58.120]  So he took him to the International Gateway and he released him and said walk that way. So that was just kind of the thing that that really pushed it over the edge.
[2:36:58.120 --> 2:37:11.120]  But this has been going on going for months and months where they've organized to declare an emergency, declare an invasion, enforce the Texas governor to act governor Abbott under under the Texas Constitution.
[2:37:11.120 --> 2:37:23.120]  Article article four section seven as the commander in chief of the Texas Constitution allows him to repel invasions and under the federal Constitution under the guarantee clause article four section four.
[2:37:23.120 --> 2:37:31.120]  The the the federal government guarantees the states are free from invasion and guarantees a Republican former government and that's not happening.
[2:37:31.120 --> 2:37:44.120]  So you also see the states have warlock authority under the federal Constitution article one section 10 clause three where they can repel invasions and that grants them warlock authority all throughout history are these states are states are sovereign.
[2:37:44.120 --> 2:37:46.120]  They have a right to protect their borders.
[2:37:46.120 --> 2:37:51.120]  And when the federal government fails to act or their intentional policy creates this nightmare.
[2:37:51.120 --> 2:37:58.120]  This mess is just sucking in all of these drugs and the cartel activity and rewarding the cartel activity.
[2:37:58.120 --> 2:38:01.120]  Then we have to act in the state has to act.
[2:38:01.120 --> 2:38:06.120]  I mean, we have a duty and obligation to protect our citizens within the within the confines of the Constitution.
[2:38:06.120 --> 2:38:13.120]  I mean, this is totally agree and how powerful is it of the Mexican president last week say the US border has collapsed.
[2:38:13.120 --> 2:38:14.120]  He wants to control it.
[2:38:14.120 --> 2:38:17.120]  The Mexican president is worried about this.
[2:38:17.120 --> 2:38:20.120]  Yeah, we we do not control the border.
[2:38:20.120 --> 2:38:21.120]  I mean, I've been down there.
[2:38:21.120 --> 2:38:22.120]  I've been to Roma.
[2:38:22.120 --> 2:38:23.120]  I've been to Eagle Pass.
[2:38:23.120 --> 2:38:26.120]  I've been to all the sections of the border and I've seen the misery down there.
[2:38:26.120 --> 2:38:28.120]  You know, I'm a veteran.
[2:38:28.120 --> 2:38:30.120]  I'm a former Navy Jag active duty.
[2:38:30.120 --> 2:38:32.120]  I've deployed to Iraq and Afghanistan.
[2:38:32.120 --> 2:38:38.120]  I've seen I've been to those dangerous spots in on the Syrian border in Al Qaim and those other areas.
[2:38:38.120 --> 2:38:40.120]  And the border remind me of that.
[2:38:40.120 --> 2:38:44.120]  It reminds me of this total lawlessness, total breakdown of the rule of law.
[2:38:44.120 --> 2:38:48.120]  And I feel so bad for our law enforcement down at a border patrol.
[2:38:48.120 --> 2:38:49.120]  They're just helpless.
[2:38:49.120 --> 2:38:50.120]  They're in a war zone.
[2:38:50.120 --> 2:38:54.120]  I mean, beheadings and murders, practice trailers full of dead bodies.
[2:38:54.120 --> 2:38:56.120]  The level of death is insane.
[2:38:56.120 --> 2:38:58.120]  It absolutely is.
[2:38:58.120 --> 2:39:06.120]  It shocks the conscious to see that the United States of America will break has broken down into this almost third world country border situation.
[2:39:06.120 --> 2:39:08.120]  And I feel bad for the people down there.
[2:39:08.120 --> 2:39:15.120]  I mean, they're suffering and we the people and it starts at the county level need to stand up and do something.
[2:39:15.120 --> 2:39:19.120]  And that's why you hit the key point except the local governments declare the emergency and the people.
[2:39:19.120 --> 2:39:27.120]  You pointed out force the governor who's already trying into the right announcement under the law under the Constitution, state and federal.
[2:39:27.120 --> 2:39:29.120]  So what is the aim of this press conference?
[2:39:29.120 --> 2:39:32.120]  I mean, you already talked to it, but let's let's get right to it.
[2:39:32.120 --> 2:39:41.120]  Yeah, the aim is to give other counties, other municipalities, other folks that are suffering the confidence and the ability to declare that same sort of emergency.
[2:39:41.120 --> 2:39:56.120]  Same clear same point of invasion and hopefully that will build and force governor Abbott to employ those those forces under his commander in chief status under the Texas Constitution article four section seven.
[2:39:56.120 --> 2:40:00.120]  And then we can actually have a border at least in Texas that is protected.
[2:40:00.120 --> 2:40:16.120]  I'd also like to see the state of Texas enter into more compacts under the compacts clause with states like Florida, Arizona, and then really from a security standpoint have the states we the people act outside the confines of the federal government.
[2:40:16.120 --> 2:40:19.120]  But that's right because of a power vacuum.
[2:40:19.120 --> 2:40:20.120]  They're not doing their job.
[2:40:20.120 --> 2:40:22.120]  It's up to us under the federal system to do this.
[2:40:22.120 --> 2:40:27.120]  And for those that don't know this, the UN says most dangerous border in the world totally collapse.
[2:40:27.120 --> 2:40:31.120]  Mexican president says US government's lost control by design.
[2:40:31.120 --> 2:40:32.120]  I mean, it's on record.
[2:40:32.120 --> 2:40:33.120]  It's got to be done.
[2:40:33.120 --> 2:40:35.120]  We can't just keep waiting for Washington.
[2:40:35.120 --> 2:40:39.120]  What do you think Abbott should do under this emergency if he does what's right?
[2:40:39.120 --> 2:40:53.120]  I think Abbott should do what Dwight D Eisenhower did in the 1950s and deploy the entire Texas National Guard and enter into compacts with other states to rebut and shut down the border completely.
[2:40:53.120 --> 2:40:58.120]  I'm sympathetic to people that want to come to the greatest country in the history of the world.
[2:40:58.120 --> 2:41:05.120]  I truly am, but I'm also sympathetic to the American citizens and we have to put the rights of the citizens above the rights of noncitizens.
[2:41:05.120 --> 2:41:06.120]  Well, sure.
[2:41:06.120 --> 2:41:08.120]  The lockdowns, the globalist programs meant to collapse the borders.
[2:41:08.120 --> 2:41:11.120]  It's not going to help these people to flood us and collapse.
[2:41:11.120 --> 2:41:12.120]  We've got to control our border.
[2:41:12.120 --> 2:41:13.120]  We're not a country.
[2:41:13.120 --> 2:41:14.120]  Right.
[2:41:14.120 --> 2:41:16.120]  If you don't have a border, you don't have a nation.
[2:41:16.120 --> 2:41:22.120]  I mean, when I was a young man reading Michael Savage books, I learned that border is language and culture.
[2:41:22.120 --> 2:41:25.120]  It's very important that we have our border.
[2:41:25.120 --> 2:41:28.120]  And if the federal government's not going to do it, and that's a misnomer.
[2:41:28.120 --> 2:41:34.120]  I mean, the federal government doesn't have this all encompassing right to defend all international borders.
[2:41:34.120 --> 2:41:36.120]  I mean, that's a misnomer in the Constitution.
[2:41:36.120 --> 2:41:41.120]  They have a right to for the naturalization and immigration process that doesn't include security.
[2:41:41.120 --> 2:41:47.120]  So we're taking a citizen of your house is being robbed by an illegal alien or by a citizen of a right to defend.
[2:41:47.120 --> 2:41:48.120]  Absolutely.
[2:41:48.120 --> 2:41:56.120]  You always have an inherent right to self-defense and that's, you know, taking on my national security law background and my, my, my background is the Navy Jag and operational law.
[2:41:56.120 --> 2:41:58.120]  That's what I think of this is I put it in that space.
[2:41:58.120 --> 2:42:00.120]  This is a national security law issue.
[2:42:00.120 --> 2:42:02.120]  This is an immigration and naturalization issue.
[2:42:02.120 --> 2:42:05.120]  This is a security issue.
[2:42:05.120 --> 2:42:11.120]  And as you know, the states, all powers not delegated to the federal government reserved to the states.
[2:42:11.120 --> 2:42:14.120]  We the people police power is reserved.
[2:42:14.120 --> 2:42:15.120]  10th Amendment.
[2:42:15.120 --> 2:42:16.120]  Correct.
[2:42:16.120 --> 2:42:22.120]  In the 10th Amendment, we have a right and a responsibility to defend our state, defend our border, defend our citizens.
[2:42:22.120 --> 2:42:24.120]  And it starts right there at the county level.
[2:42:24.120 --> 2:42:27.120]  County, the founders, this is why the founders were so brilliant.
[2:42:27.120 --> 2:42:34.120]  I mean, that's why we have the county sheriffs and the precincts and everything is meant to be local government checks and balances.
[2:42:34.120 --> 2:42:35.120]  That's right.
[2:42:35.120 --> 2:42:36.120]  And we have forgotten that over time.
[2:42:36.120 --> 2:42:44.120]  And it's, it's time we remind the American people and something like this to act within our lawful means and lawful abilities within the Constitution is a way to do it.
[2:42:44.120 --> 2:42:46.120]  Well, Jonathan, who lands, stay there one more segment.

[2:46:57.120 --> 2:47:17.120]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[2:47:27.120 --> 2:47:35.120]  They're not just increasing the cost of energy and food, they've collapsed the third world into the United States.
[2:47:35.120 --> 2:47:45.120]  It's replacement migration, a giant group of underclass, hermeneunderclass they can control. They're exploiting these people.
[2:47:45.120 --> 2:47:50.120]  A lawyer who's heavily involved in this and a former veteran, Jonathan Hoolihan, is joining us.
[2:47:50.120 --> 2:47:56.120]  Since I heard about this a few days ago when we were trying to line you up for the show, it has gotten a lot of attention all over big news.
[2:47:56.120 --> 2:48:00.120]  That is a huge success right now, Jonathan.
[2:48:00.120 --> 2:48:06.120]  But again, for those that don't know what's happening, particularly on the Texas border, Arizona's bad as well.
[2:48:06.120 --> 2:48:12.120]  This press conference at 3 p.m. today, Owen Schroeder is going to be covering it during the war room, 3 p.m. Central.
[2:48:12.120 --> 2:48:16.120]  Give it to us with both guns. How bad is it for people that don't know?
[2:48:16.120 --> 2:48:23.120]  The UN, I showed it earlier, says the most dangerous border in the world, bar none.
[2:48:23.120 --> 2:48:29.120]  It's absolutely out of control. Like I said earlier, I've been to Iraq and Afghanistan on their borders and it reminds me of that.
[2:48:29.120 --> 2:48:34.120]  It's a war zone. I mean, people are fleeing. They have nowhere to go in a lot of circumstances.
[2:48:34.120 --> 2:48:39.120]  It's a lot of our most vulnerable American citizens are suffering and bearing the brunt of it.
[2:48:39.120 --> 2:48:44.120]  We have non-governmental organizations that are funding this in a lot of ways.
[2:48:44.120 --> 2:48:55.120]  Like certain groups like Catholic Charities are actually incentivized by the federal government to bring in a lot of these illegal aliens by warring them federal contracts.
[2:48:55.120 --> 2:49:02.120]  So you can imagine the pull that's coming in from the United States. It's coming from not just Mexico, but south of the border.
[2:49:02.120 --> 2:49:06.120]  I mean, they're apprehending people from China, Iran, Iraq.
[2:49:06.120 --> 2:49:14.120]  Oh, groups of Afghans. I saw a number out of the State Department last week. 25% of Central America now lives in the U.S.
[2:49:14.120 --> 2:49:19.120]  So, and a lot of these people are guideaways or they don't even know who they are.
[2:49:19.120 --> 2:49:25.120]  I mean, this is a national security nightmare. You don't know who's entering your country. You don't know the command and control.
[2:49:25.120 --> 2:49:34.120]  We go through TSA checkpoints to fly from Austin to New York or from New York to Albuquerque or Albuquerque to St. Paul.
[2:49:34.120 --> 2:49:37.120]  But there's nothing at the border.
[2:49:37.120 --> 2:49:41.120]  Again, putting the rights of the non-citizen above the rights of the American citizen.
[2:49:41.120 --> 2:49:46.120]  And think about in Texas, we have really high property taxes and you hear people complaining about all the time.
[2:49:46.120 --> 2:49:49.120]  So I try and make those connections for people.
[2:49:49.120 --> 2:50:02.120]  Well, the reason we have bonds, the reason we have highway bonds, school bonds, hospital bonds, all this infrastructure, additional infrastructure we have to buy is because non-citizens that haven't paid into the system are coming in.
[2:50:02.120 --> 2:50:09.120]  So it's not just, it is a huge national security issue, but it's also just fundamental fairness about putting the rights of the American citizen.
[2:50:09.120 --> 2:50:13.120]  And this is really just new welfare people to be brainwashed and controlled.
[2:50:13.120 --> 2:50:18.120]  I mean, any day you go to the border now, it's just solid masses pouring across.
[2:50:18.120 --> 2:50:26.120]  And they have us, what bothers me the most about it is the smile on their face that they know that the rule of law is broken down. There's no consequence.
[2:50:26.120 --> 2:50:31.120]  And you've got the leftist NGOs in charge of the border patrol now managing the giant facilities.
[2:50:31.120 --> 2:50:32.120]  We've been down there.
[2:50:32.120 --> 2:50:36.120]  Literally, former Soros group heads run all this now.
[2:50:36.120 --> 2:50:39.120]  Yeah, when I was in Roma, we were right there on the border.
[2:50:39.120 --> 2:50:42.120]  I was there with Colonel Allen West when he was running for governor.
[2:50:42.120 --> 2:50:48.120]  And we saw just a line of folks coming up and actually the Texas National Guard, they had radios.
[2:50:48.120 --> 2:50:50.120]  They were talking with the coyotes.
[2:50:50.120 --> 2:50:51.120]  They were allowing them to come over.
[2:50:51.120 --> 2:50:55.120]  They're helping them out of the boats, which is a crime, by the way, under Title 8.
[2:50:55.120 --> 2:50:59.120]  And then they were ushering them up to the NGOs.
[2:50:59.120 --> 2:51:05.120]  And you've got the bureaucrats in charge of the border patrol, directing the human smuggling right in front of you.
[2:51:05.120 --> 2:51:07.120]  Yeah, it's absolutely a travesty.
[2:51:07.120 --> 2:51:10.120]  And it's clear to see from anybody that's been in the military, what's going on.
[2:51:10.120 --> 2:51:14.120]  They'll send a whole mass of family units across with children.
[2:51:14.120 --> 2:51:17.120]  They sent them out a hundred at a time down the river.
[2:51:17.120 --> 2:51:23.120]  You have the fentanyl and the other things being smuggled in areas that where the border patrol is tied up.
[2:51:23.120 --> 2:51:27.120]  And everyone I know, including me, has friends and family that died of fentanyl.
[2:51:27.120 --> 2:51:31.120]  I mean, we're literally being chemical weapon by it.
[2:51:31.120 --> 2:51:32.120]  Yeah, that's the invasion.
[2:51:32.120 --> 2:51:41.120]  And if you go back to the CCP book, Unconventional Warfare, then it's clear this is part of the drug war.
[2:51:41.120 --> 2:51:47.120]  It's part of the, you know, the CCP gets opioid chemicals and fentanyl chemicals into the hands of the cartels.
[2:51:47.120 --> 2:51:49.120]  They smuggle them across.
[2:51:49.120 --> 2:51:53.120]  So it's part of this larger kind of cold war between the United States and China.
[2:51:53.120 --> 2:52:00.120]  And George Soros DA's in every major city, almost every major city, including awesome where I live, lets them go the next day.
[2:52:00.120 --> 2:52:06.120]  You're found with backpacks of fentanyl and up to kill 20,000 people and you're let go like that.
[2:52:06.120 --> 2:52:13.120]  Yeah, and I feel bad for Attorney General Kim Pax in a lot of ways, because he's almost helpless to prosecute these corrupt county officials.
[2:52:13.120 --> 2:52:19.120]  Because, you know, he's he falls in the executive branch of the Texas Constitution of the Texas government.
[2:52:19.120 --> 2:52:22.120]  And he doesn't have statewide authority to go and prosecute.
[2:52:22.120 --> 2:52:24.120]  So what do we need to do, Jonathan?
[2:52:24.120 --> 2:52:26.120]  We need to make a big noise about this.
[2:52:26.120 --> 2:52:29.120]  We need to get more counties to join more cities to join.
[2:52:29.120 --> 2:52:33.120]  We need to point out that this is literally the collapse of the U.S.
[2:52:33.120 --> 2:52:35.120]  What else do we do?
[2:52:35.120 --> 2:52:36.120]  You are absolutely correct.
[2:52:36.120 --> 2:52:41.120]  We need people to realize that the states are sovereign.
[2:52:41.120 --> 2:52:43.120]  We almost need a civics lesson.
[2:52:43.120 --> 2:52:46.120]  We need people to realize that the states have a right to defend themselves.
[2:52:46.120 --> 2:52:56.120]  Under the United States Constitution, Article 1, Section 10, Clause 3, that this is an actual invasion and that the states can join and repel that invasion.
[2:52:56.120 --> 2:52:58.120]  We need to look to our history.
[2:52:58.120 --> 2:53:12.120]  We need to look to win Dwight D. Eisenhower in the 1950s, mobilized, used one of his World War II generals from the European Theater, mobilized the entire National Guard, put them on the border and stopped it.
[2:53:12.120 --> 2:53:19.120]  And again, the Mexican president, who's a socialist, is on our side two weeks ago saying,
[2:53:19.120 --> 2:53:23.120]  declared emergency, the border has failed, which makes everybody flood Mexico.
[2:53:23.120 --> 2:53:24.120]  They don't want that either.
[2:53:24.120 --> 2:53:28.120]  This is literally, the Mexican president said America is becoming a failed state.
[2:53:28.120 --> 2:53:30.120]  It's true.
[2:53:30.120 --> 2:53:32.120]  Yeah, this is a worst-case scenario.
[2:53:32.120 --> 2:53:36.120]  I mean, this is complete open borders, complete open fentanyl.
[2:53:36.120 --> 2:53:39.120]  I mean, across the board, it's a security nightmare.
[2:53:39.120 --> 2:53:44.120]  If I fly into Cancun, great place to go, but they're probably 20 times, they check who I am.
[2:53:44.120 --> 2:53:45.120]  And I'm not mad.
[2:53:45.120 --> 2:53:46.120]  Like, I'm coming to your country.
[2:53:46.120 --> 2:53:47.120]  You're going to check who I am.
[2:53:47.120 --> 2:53:49.120]  We're not checking anybody.
[2:53:49.120 --> 2:53:51.120]  This is insane.
[2:53:51.120 --> 2:53:52.120]  Yeah.
[2:53:52.120 --> 2:53:53.120]  Well, you have no idea.
[2:53:53.120 --> 2:53:55.120]  I mean, when I was overseas, we would use bioenrollment.
[2:53:55.120 --> 2:53:57.120]  We'd question people.
[2:53:57.120 --> 2:54:01.120]  We'd go to villages and they would bioenroll people and we'd know exactly who they were.
[2:54:01.120 --> 2:54:04.120]  If we ever found DNA on a roadside bomb or anything like that.
[2:54:04.120 --> 2:54:09.120]  I mean, at this point, we're just letting everybody through, we have no idea what their affiliations are.
[2:54:09.120 --> 2:54:11.120]  Is this not an active war by Biden?
[2:54:11.120 --> 2:54:14.120]  I mean, literally, they're attacking the U.S.
[2:54:14.120 --> 2:54:19.120]  Well, I think the policy of the United States government is certainly intentional,
[2:54:19.120 --> 2:54:21.120]  and they're not doing anything to get in the way of it.
[2:54:21.120 --> 2:54:24.120]  So what those motivations are, I can't speak to that.
[2:54:24.120 --> 2:54:26.120]  It makes absolutely no sense to me.
[2:54:26.120 --> 2:54:29.120]  I can't understand why you would let your country get destroyed,
[2:54:29.120 --> 2:54:32.120]  why you would put the rights of non-citizens of both citizens.
[2:54:32.120 --> 2:54:35.120]  It's just, it's intentional policy.
[2:54:35.120 --> 2:54:37.120]  There's no other way to put it.
[2:54:37.120 --> 2:54:40.120]  Well, make sure, William, I'm sure you've seen the U.N. documents, the Klaus Schwab stuff,
[2:54:40.120 --> 2:54:43.120]  where we're placing migration, break the borders,
[2:54:43.120 --> 2:54:45.120]  use a collapse of the Third World to take over the First World.
[2:54:45.120 --> 2:54:51.120]  It's obviously a plan, but what else can we do because you're on the ground to fight this?
[2:54:51.120 --> 2:54:57.120]  I mean, we could just keep an eyes on it and enabling citizens to stand up for the Constitution.
[2:54:57.120 --> 2:54:59.120]  I mean, that's all we can do at this point.
[2:54:59.120 --> 2:55:01.120]  We could put pressure on Governor Abbott.
[2:55:01.120 --> 2:55:05.120]  We can call Governor Abbott's office and say declare an invasion,
[2:55:05.120 --> 2:55:07.120]  support the counties that are standing up for this.
[2:55:07.120 --> 2:55:09.120]  It's all on Abbott.
[2:55:09.120 --> 2:55:12.120]  Let's create a constitutional crisis between Abbott and the federal government.
[2:55:12.120 --> 2:55:13.120]  That's right.
[2:55:13.120 --> 2:55:16.120]  Those don't know, declaring an invasion is in the state and federal constitution,
[2:55:16.120 --> 2:55:20.120]  which this is, this is a war, declare a war.
[2:55:20.120 --> 2:55:24.120]  Yeah, I mean, the invasion doesn't mean just state actors.
[2:55:24.120 --> 2:55:26.120]  You can have non-state actors as well.
[2:55:26.120 --> 2:55:30.120]  Think about the targeting that we've done in operations all over the years.
[2:55:30.120 --> 2:55:34.120]  We've targeted non-state actors and we've killed them overseas.
[2:55:34.120 --> 2:55:39.120]  So we can declare an invasion at our own southern border for non-state actors,
[2:55:39.120 --> 2:55:41.120]  but I'll take it a step further.
[2:55:41.120 --> 2:55:46.120]  This is a narco terrorist organization, the cartels, that are organizing.
[2:55:46.120 --> 2:55:47.120]  They're C2ing it.
[2:55:47.120 --> 2:55:49.120]  They're commanding, controlling it.
[2:55:49.120 --> 2:55:52.120]  They have a complicated logistics network.
[2:55:52.120 --> 2:55:53.120]  They use bans.
[2:55:53.120 --> 2:55:59.120]  I'm sure you've seen the bans where they serialize, organize and move people across.
[2:55:59.120 --> 2:56:01.120]  And Pelosi is calling MS-13 God's children.
[2:56:01.120 --> 2:56:02.120]  Yeah.
[2:56:02.120 --> 2:56:05.120]  The Democrats and now with NGOs are in command of the border patrol,
[2:56:05.120 --> 2:56:08.120]  organizing the coyotes and smugglers.
[2:56:08.120 --> 2:56:14.120]  This is the, this is incredible organized crime run by the rogue administration of Joe Biden.
[2:56:14.120 --> 2:56:15.120]  Yeah.
[2:56:15.120 --> 2:56:19.120]  One thing I think that they can do to help, and this is kind of outside the scope of the county,
[2:56:19.120 --> 2:56:24.120]  but they can declare these cartels as FTOs, foreign terrorist organizations.
[2:56:24.120 --> 2:56:30.120]  I mean, under Title VIII, we can declare organizations as foreign terrorist organizations,
[2:56:30.120 --> 2:56:35.120]  and that opens up an entire wicket of authorities, whether we're talking about Title XVIII,
[2:56:35.120 --> 2:56:39.120]  and we can prosecute anybody that comes across that border under Title XVIII
[2:56:39.120 --> 2:56:43.120]  from materials support to terrorism, but also we can target people south of the border.
[2:56:43.120 --> 2:56:45.120]  We can create a task force.
[2:56:45.120 --> 2:56:48.120]  And look, I'm not one of these guys that wants military intervention.
[2:56:48.120 --> 2:56:49.120]  No, I don't want wars overseas.
[2:56:49.120 --> 2:56:50.120]  I agree.
[2:56:50.120 --> 2:56:52.120]  But this is a real war against our country.
[2:56:52.120 --> 2:56:55.120]  We need full mobilization, full commitment now.
[2:56:55.120 --> 2:56:59.120]  Yeah, I mean, I think you're talking about something completely different when you're protecting your southern border.
[2:56:59.120 --> 2:57:04.120]  So if it's good enough for some countries in the Middle East, it's good enough for our southern border.
[2:57:04.120 --> 2:57:05.120]  Our military set up for the border.
[2:57:05.120 --> 2:57:08.120]  Like this is constitutional.
[2:57:08.120 --> 2:57:10.120]  Yeah, and there's a long historical precedent for this.
[2:57:10.120 --> 2:57:14.120]  I mean, the border wars of the early 19-
[2:57:14.120 --> 2:57:16.120]  Blackjack, cursing, all of it.
[2:57:16.120 --> 2:57:19.120]  All right, Jonathan, I appreciate you.

[2:57:33.120 --> 2:57:34.120]  Thank you so much.
[2:57:34.120 --> 2:57:35.120]  All right.
[2:57:35.120 --> 2:57:36.120]  Thank you, sir.
[2:57:36.120 --> 2:57:37.120]  Wow.
[2:57:37.120 --> 2:57:38.120]  What a time to be alive.
[2:57:38.120 --> 2:57:39.120]  Texas Waking Up, taking action.
[2:57:39.120 --> 2:57:42.120]  We got calls for two segments that Jason Bermas takes over.
[2:57:42.120 --> 2:57:46.120]  Stay there.

[2:58:39.120 --> 2:58:47.120]  the answer to 1984 is 1776.
[2:58:47.120 --> 2:58:51.120]  The National Suisse's new film, 2000 Mules, is the most important documentary in modern
[2:58:51.120 --> 2:58:56.120]  times because it proves how the deep state stole the 2020 election and how they're planning
[2:58:56.120 --> 2:59:00.120]  to steal future elections and complete our journey to basically being like Venezuela.
[2:59:00.120 --> 2:59:04.120]  Now it's great that it's online and it's great that millions watch it online, but you need
[2:59:04.120 --> 2:59:10.120]  to have the high quality HD DVD in your library with the expanded extras so it can't be censored
[2:59:10.120 --> 2:59:14.120]  in the future and so you can show it to everyone you know.

[2:59:26.120 --> 2:59:30.120]  classic that predicted the great reset, and of course part one, part two, and now the
[2:59:30.120 --> 2:59:36.120]  part three of COVID land, get them separate, get them together, massively discounted at
[2:59:36.120 --> 2:59:41.120]  infowarstore.com, but everyone needs to have 2000 Mules in their library so the globalists
[2:59:41.120 --> 2:59:43.120]  can't censor it.
[2:59:43.120 --> 3:00:09.120]  Go to infowarstore.com to get 2000 Mules today.
[3:00:13.120 --> 3:00:30.120]  I'm watching the midterms, then you would think our country is Mad Max Thunderdome.
[3:00:30.120 --> 3:00:37.120]  This guy is like, they're coming from Guatemala, they're coming from Mexico.
[3:00:37.120 --> 3:00:57.120]  There's a liberal that's coming.
[3:00:57.120 --> 3:01:26.120]  And then you would think everybody in the countries is like to the bunker.
[3:01:26.120 --> 3:01:53.120]  We're brought up to believe America is invincible.
[3:01:53.120 --> 3:01:58.120]  We're brought up to believe we've got security and prosperity and opportunity and freedom,
[3:01:58.120 --> 3:02:01.120]  but all that comes to an end and we're here now.
[3:02:01.120 --> 3:02:07.120]  We're watching global government run by corrupt out of control corporations that feel completely
[3:02:07.120 --> 3:02:11.120]  immune from any type of scrutiny carrying out a plan.
[3:02:11.120 --> 3:02:13.120]  I told you it was coming because I have their plans.
[3:02:13.120 --> 3:02:15.120]  They're so arrogant.
[3:02:15.120 --> 3:02:17.120]  They have admitted it all.
[3:02:17.120 --> 3:02:22.120]  They think you're so distracted, so stupid, they'll never wake up.
[3:02:22.120 --> 3:02:23.120]  But I believe in you.
[3:02:23.120 --> 3:02:24.120]  I believe in myself.
[3:02:24.120 --> 3:02:26.120]  I believe in my family.
[3:02:26.120 --> 3:02:30.120]  And I believe in common sense in history.
[3:02:30.120 --> 3:02:32.120]  And you notice they're desperate.
[3:02:32.120 --> 3:02:33.120]  They're scared.
[3:02:33.120 --> 3:02:38.120]  They're censoring and attacking and threatening and false flagging everywhere because they're
[3:02:38.120 --> 3:02:41.120]  losing.
[3:02:41.120 --> 3:02:45.120]  So my bet on you was right.
[3:02:45.120 --> 3:02:47.120]  Plus, I couldn't join these people.
[3:02:47.120 --> 3:02:49.120]  You know, I'm not proud of it.
[3:02:49.120 --> 3:02:53.120]  I don't tell you these stories because it's like, oh, I'm special.
[3:02:53.120 --> 3:02:54.120]  They tried to harm me.
[3:02:54.120 --> 3:02:56.120]  They tried to buy everybody off.
[3:02:56.120 --> 3:02:59.120]  And most people took the money.
[3:02:59.120 --> 3:03:00.120]  I didn't.
[3:03:00.120 --> 3:03:03.120]  When the Kissinger Group tried to harm me, didn't take it.
[3:03:03.120 --> 3:03:06.120]  When the Bilderberg Group reached out, didn't take it.
[3:03:06.120 --> 3:03:08.120]  People say, well, why don't you tell about those meetings?
[3:03:08.120 --> 3:03:10.120]  Well, those are meetings that are private.
[3:03:10.120 --> 3:03:13.120]  And I told you the meetings happened.
[3:03:13.120 --> 3:03:16.120]  The few times they'd set it in front of the crew, I told you about it.
[3:03:16.120 --> 3:03:20.120]  John Harmon saw it with the head of the Kissinger Group trying to harm me, come to New York.
[3:03:20.120 --> 3:03:21.120]  We're going to hire you.
[3:03:21.120 --> 3:03:22.120]  It's going to be great.
[3:03:22.120 --> 3:03:27.120]  And I said, you know you're seeing all this publicly.
[3:03:27.120 --> 3:03:30.120]  He said, you're going to lose, Jones.
[3:03:30.120 --> 3:03:32.120]  This is silly.
[3:03:32.120 --> 3:03:34.120]  It's all foregone.
[3:03:34.120 --> 3:03:36.120]  Just give up.
[3:03:36.120 --> 3:03:42.120]  Well, if you guys weren't promoting pedophilia, if you weren't promoting destruction of humanity,
[3:03:42.120 --> 3:03:46.120]  maybe I'd sell out to you.
[3:03:46.120 --> 3:03:48.120]  Because some foreign army, like the Romans, weren't perfect.
[3:03:48.120 --> 3:03:49.120]  They had problems.
[3:03:49.120 --> 3:03:51.120]  But compared to the globalists, they were angels.
[3:03:51.120 --> 3:03:52.120]  We got aquifers.
[3:03:52.120 --> 3:03:53.120]  We got medicine.
[3:03:53.120 --> 3:03:54.120]  We got crops.
[3:03:54.120 --> 3:03:55.120]  We got science.
[3:03:55.120 --> 3:03:56.120]  And we're taking over.
[3:03:56.120 --> 3:03:57.120]  Oh, OK.
[3:03:57.120 --> 3:03:59.120]  But you're not those people.
[3:03:59.120 --> 3:04:02.120]  You're horrible.
[3:04:02.120 --> 3:04:08.120]  You do everything you can to dumb people down and make them stupid so you can control them.
[3:04:08.120 --> 3:04:14.120]  And I'm just like, no, that metaphysically doesn't feel good to me.
[3:04:14.120 --> 3:04:16.120]  It doesn't feel good.
[3:04:16.120 --> 3:04:24.120]  No, being a rebel, being informed, being involved, being engaged, that feels good.
[3:04:24.120 --> 3:04:27.120]  My soul feels good fighting you.
[3:04:27.120 --> 3:04:30.120]  My soul feels good standing against you.
[3:04:30.120 --> 3:04:32.120]  So here's a little newsflash.
[3:04:32.120 --> 3:04:33.120]  You can put me in prison.
[3:04:33.120 --> 3:04:34.120]  You can destroy me.
[3:04:34.120 --> 3:04:35.120]  You can kill me.
[3:04:35.120 --> 3:04:36.120]  You can do anything you want.
[3:04:36.120 --> 3:04:38.120]  I'm never going to give up.
[3:04:38.120 --> 3:04:40.120]  I'm beyond your grasp.
[3:04:40.120 --> 3:04:46.120]  And so are our viewers and listeners who I love beyond everything except God.
[3:04:46.120 --> 3:04:47.120]  All right.
[3:04:47.120 --> 3:04:49.120]  Your phone calls back in 60 seconds.
[3:04:49.120 --> 3:04:52.120]  And then Jason Bermas loaded for bear straight ahead.
[3:04:52.120 --> 3:04:53.120]  But get ready, callers.
[3:04:53.120 --> 3:04:59.120]  I'm going bam, bam, bam.

[3:06:23.120 --> 3:06:33.120]  Everywhere I go, always getting in trouble, leaving them girls that hate to see me go.
[3:06:33.120 --> 3:06:43.120]  They tried to hang me in Oakland and they did in Francisco.
[3:06:43.120 --> 3:06:47.120]  But I wouldn't show hell no, I broke that road.
[3:06:47.120 --> 3:06:54.120]  They had to let me go and sought out bad news.
[3:06:54.120 --> 3:06:59.120]  But knowing the bad news lets you know the good news.
[3:06:59.120 --> 3:07:02.120]  Leaving little girls that hate to see me go.
[3:07:02.120 --> 3:07:06.120]  Let's go ahead and take your phone calls right now.
[3:07:06.120 --> 3:07:08.120]  In the order they're received.
[3:07:08.120 --> 3:07:10.120]  Lath in Tennessee.
[3:07:10.120 --> 3:07:12.120]  Lath, welcome and thanks for holding.
[3:07:12.120 --> 3:07:13.120]  Hey, Alex.
[3:07:13.120 --> 3:07:14.120]  Love you, man.
[3:07:14.120 --> 3:07:15.120]  Been following you for two decades now.
[3:07:15.120 --> 3:07:19.120]  I wanted to touch a little bit on the CERN out there, the Large Heart and Collider in
[3:07:19.120 --> 3:07:20.120]  Geneva, Switzerland.
[3:07:20.120 --> 3:07:25.120]  The little bit of the overall basis, they're trying to find the fifth fundamental force
[3:07:25.120 --> 3:07:26.120]  of nature.
[3:07:26.120 --> 3:07:28.120]  The Bosong Particle.
[3:07:28.120 --> 3:07:29.120]  Correct.
[3:07:29.120 --> 3:07:34.120]  And the four fundamental forces of nature is gravity, electromagnetism, strong force
[3:07:34.120 --> 3:07:35.120]  and the weak forces.
[3:07:35.120 --> 3:07:41.120]  It affects everything from the north to south pole, gravity and everything.
[3:07:41.120 --> 3:07:47.120]  Their aim, quote unquote, many physicists aim to unite the fundamental forces under a
[3:07:47.120 --> 3:07:48.120]  single unified theory.
[3:07:48.120 --> 3:07:53.120]  The theory framework to explain the entire universe, which is the Big Bang Theory.
[3:07:53.120 --> 3:07:59.120]  The amount of energy that they're producing at that particular facility, it's a particle
[3:07:59.120 --> 3:08:00.120]  collider.
[3:08:00.120 --> 3:08:01.120]  What happens when something...
[3:08:01.120 --> 3:08:02.120]  Well, let's explain it.
[3:08:02.120 --> 3:08:08.120]  It's stuff a trillion times more dangerous than an atomic bomb, a billion times more
[3:08:08.120 --> 3:08:10.120]  dangerous than a hydrogen bomb.
[3:08:10.120 --> 3:08:15.120]  They admit they are jacking with the literal building blocks of reality.
[3:08:15.120 --> 3:08:23.120]  I mean, it's 16 billion watt-hours times 10 squared by 17.
[3:08:23.120 --> 3:08:29.120]  I mean, the amount of energy and the unfortunate part is, after they start it, they can't
[3:08:29.120 --> 3:08:30.120]  stop it.
[3:08:30.120 --> 3:08:37.360]  They estimate, by 2028, it should slow down, but there's no telling, which slowing down
[3:08:37.360 --> 3:08:41.560]  in their overall terms means that Big Bang is going to end up happening.
[3:08:41.560 --> 3:08:43.280]  With inside that overall...
[3:08:43.280 --> 3:08:44.480]  That's a perfectly saying.
[3:08:44.480 --> 3:08:50.360]  They are trying to create an artificial Big Bang, and we say, why are you doing it?
[3:08:50.360 --> 3:08:52.520]  You read the writings, they go, we're in a cult.
[3:08:52.520 --> 3:08:53.520]  We want to be God.
[3:08:53.520 --> 3:08:54.520]  We got to do this.
[3:08:54.520 --> 3:08:55.520]  I mean, literally.
[3:08:55.520 --> 3:08:58.880]  It's just like the same thing that they did with the MNRA, all these...
[3:08:58.880 --> 3:08:59.880]  Exactly.
[3:08:59.880 --> 3:09:02.760]  It's mad scientist party time.
[3:09:02.760 --> 3:09:06.680]  I mean, it's a horrible time we're living in, and thank God for you to end up being
[3:09:06.680 --> 3:09:12.040]  here to get this information out there, get people aware, and do what we can.
[3:09:12.040 --> 3:09:16.240]  I mean, we have one here in Knoxville, Tennessee, and down there in Texas as well.
[3:09:16.240 --> 3:09:21.280]  They're not as big, and they're not funded and led by Schwab and Thoros and Gates and
[3:09:21.280 --> 3:09:26.080]  so forth as well, but I really wanted to bring this to everyone's attention.
[3:09:26.080 --> 3:09:27.080]  And I mean...
[3:09:27.080 --> 3:09:28.080]  Immunally said, ladies, we love you.
[3:09:28.080 --> 3:09:29.080]  No, you're right.
[3:09:29.080 --> 3:09:31.080]  We should do a whole show on the Hadron Collider.
[3:09:31.080 --> 3:09:32.080]  Damn right.
[3:09:32.080 --> 3:09:33.080]  I mean, it is just...
[3:09:33.080 --> 3:09:34.080]  That's what I'm saying.
[3:09:34.080 --> 3:09:35.080]  It is so insane.
[3:09:35.080 --> 3:09:36.080]  Thank you.
[3:09:36.080 --> 3:09:37.080]  All right.
[3:09:37.080 --> 3:09:41.680]  Up next here, who's been the longest-holding person?
[3:09:41.680 --> 3:09:43.280]  Brandon in California.
[3:09:43.280 --> 3:09:44.280]  Welcome.
[3:09:44.280 --> 3:09:45.280]  Hey, Alex.
[3:09:45.280 --> 3:09:47.080]  Great to be on here again.
[3:09:47.080 --> 3:09:49.080]  God bless you and your family.
[3:09:49.080 --> 3:09:50.080]  God bless you.
[3:09:50.080 --> 3:09:51.080]  Hope you had a great...
[3:09:51.080 --> 3:09:55.880]  And I was just curious, Joe Rogan talked about it a lot, and he sort of obsessed with the
[3:09:55.880 --> 3:09:59.320]  story, but Bob Lazar, like, what do you know about that?
[3:09:59.320 --> 3:10:00.760]  I haven't heard your opinion on it.
[3:10:00.760 --> 3:10:01.760]  Do you believe him?
[3:10:01.760 --> 3:10:03.080]  Do you think it's part of a sigh-up?
[3:10:03.080 --> 3:10:09.080]  Do you think he, like, thinks he's right or knows, but he actually isn't?
[3:10:09.080 --> 3:10:13.080]  A hundred percent we're being manipulated from outside forces.
[3:10:13.080 --> 3:10:14.080]  And...
[3:10:14.080 --> 3:10:16.080]  So it's definitely a sigh-up.
[3:10:16.080 --> 3:10:18.080]  I don't know.
[3:10:18.080 --> 3:10:19.080]  I don't know.
[3:10:19.080 --> 3:10:21.680]  I'm not going to say about things I don't know.
[3:10:21.680 --> 3:10:26.160]  I just know that it's not flying saucers from other planets.
[3:10:26.160 --> 3:10:27.160]  It's interdimensional.
[3:10:27.160 --> 3:10:28.160]  It's interdimensional.
[3:10:28.160 --> 3:10:34.480]  So they have this technology and they're trying to manipulate the planet into thinking we're
[3:10:34.480 --> 3:10:40.960]  going to be invaded by aliens, and they've likely taken scientists and, like, probably
[3:10:40.960 --> 3:10:45.600]  brainwashed them to think that there are aliens or something like that.
[3:10:45.600 --> 3:10:48.440]  The globalists say they're building the alien system.
[3:10:48.440 --> 3:10:50.320]  They are the aliens.
[3:10:50.320 --> 3:10:52.480]  The aliens aren't coming from far away.
[3:10:52.480 --> 3:10:55.480]  Mad scientists are building the alien force.
[3:10:55.480 --> 3:10:57.440]  They're building the new system.
[3:10:57.440 --> 3:10:58.440]  Wow.
[3:10:58.440 --> 3:10:59.440]  I mean...
[3:10:59.440 --> 3:11:00.440]  That's what a god does.
[3:11:00.440 --> 3:11:01.840]  A god creates a new system.
[3:11:01.840 --> 3:11:02.840]  They're copying god.
[3:11:02.840 --> 3:11:03.840]  Does that make sense?
[3:11:03.840 --> 3:11:05.280]  That does make sense.
[3:11:05.280 --> 3:11:12.400]  You laid it out beautifully in episode 911, that hour and 50 minutes on Joe Rogan's podcast.
[3:11:12.400 --> 3:11:18.800]  And you do talk about how it is interdimensional more than it is from, you know, another planet
[3:11:18.800 --> 3:11:19.800]  out there.
[3:11:19.800 --> 3:11:20.800]  And...
[3:11:20.800 --> 3:11:21.800]  But yeah.
[3:11:21.800 --> 3:11:23.200]  Also, what do you think of Admiral Burge?
[3:11:23.200 --> 3:11:26.000]  Is that part of the sigh-up, too?
[3:11:26.000 --> 3:11:27.600]  Oh, brother, it's all crazy.
[3:11:27.600 --> 3:11:29.600]  Brandon, I appreciate your call.
[3:11:29.600 --> 3:11:31.600]  Let's go ahead and take another call here.
[3:11:31.600 --> 3:11:36.760]  Let's go ahead and talk to Frederick in Indiana.
[3:11:36.760 --> 3:11:38.760]  Frederick, go ahead.
[3:11:38.760 --> 3:11:39.760]  Alice.
[3:11:39.760 --> 3:11:40.760]  Hi.
[3:11:40.760 --> 3:11:49.240]  To stay on the topic of aliens, and in the area of David Ike, Ethan Catherine Austin,
[3:11:49.240 --> 3:11:55.480]  who said that she was asked by a military guy if he wanted to be an alien, as well as
[3:11:55.480 --> 3:12:01.960]  staying with him in the geoengineering, which he won't touch on, understandably so.
[3:12:01.960 --> 3:12:07.000]  And finally, Mancow, who was on your show several years ago, discussing a shapeshifter
[3:12:07.000 --> 3:12:11.200]  that he had met in Hollywood, and maybe you can recap on that.
[3:12:11.200 --> 3:12:14.760]  Let's say there's no doubt that we're alone on this planet.
[3:12:14.760 --> 3:12:18.840]  There's a lot of stuff going on, but there's not just the bad guys, there's the good guys.
[3:12:18.840 --> 3:12:24.720]  Well, do you think there's good other entities or other worldly entities, interdimensional
[3:12:24.720 --> 3:12:25.720]  entities?
[3:12:25.720 --> 3:12:26.720]  Yeah, they're called angels.
[3:12:26.720 --> 3:12:33.680]  Last night, I was having a big briefing, two hour briefing, direct transfer.
[3:12:33.680 --> 3:12:38.640]  The problem is I'm so weak that I'm trying to process it, but I had a two hour download
[3:12:38.640 --> 3:12:42.240]  last night, big angel in the room, big meeting.
[3:12:42.240 --> 3:12:45.440]  It's why they're so upset right now.
[3:12:45.440 --> 3:12:46.440]  They're really upset right now.
[3:12:46.440 --> 3:12:53.840]  No, I had a big meeting last night, and next level, two hours, direct, direct, you're
[3:12:53.840 --> 3:12:59.200]  trying to cram all this in though, and it was a, it was quite a meeting though, two
[3:12:59.200 --> 3:13:00.200]  hour meeting.
[3:13:00.200 --> 3:13:05.960]  Does it cut, how does the geoengineering type, according to Wiggington, they're just going
[3:13:05.960 --> 3:13:07.840]  to kill our planet within five to 10 years.
[3:13:07.840 --> 3:13:12.360]  That's the plan, kill the planet, yeah, because here's the, of course we bloom as babies and
[3:13:12.360 --> 3:13:15.680]  throw fits and put paint on the walls or anything.
[3:13:15.680 --> 3:13:20.280]  We're about to hit this next level where we're going to just go interplanetary, intergalactic,
[3:13:20.280 --> 3:13:21.280]  interdimensional.
[3:13:21.280 --> 3:13:26.440]  And so they're trying to stop this, but they already failed.
[3:13:26.440 --> 3:13:31.280]  The good news is, if 10% of our people survive this, they can't stop it.
[3:13:31.280 --> 3:13:32.280]  Okay.
[3:13:32.280 --> 3:13:37.320]  So with the band cow and the shapeshifter that he encountered when he was out in Hollywood
[3:13:37.320 --> 3:13:42.120]  and David Ike and then talking about reptilians and shapeshifting, and I even had my experience
[3:13:42.120 --> 3:13:46.920]  with the one sleep paralysis episode I had and my consciousness was awake and my body
[3:13:46.920 --> 3:13:52.800]  was asleep and a massive reptilian had its claw around my hand around my throat, whether
[3:13:52.800 --> 3:13:58.200]  that was my own mind or whether it was seeing into another dimension while my body was asleep
[3:13:58.200 --> 3:13:59.600]  and my consciousness was awake.
[3:13:59.600 --> 3:14:00.600]  I don't know.
[3:14:00.600 --> 3:14:06.880]  It's the only time I ever had it, but how do the reptilians or any other ailing play
[3:14:06.880 --> 3:14:07.880]  into this?
[3:14:07.880 --> 3:14:13.840]  I'm sorry, I'm sorry, Frederick, sorry, Aubrey and Ethan and Kevin and Mike, get their numbers.
[3:14:13.840 --> 3:14:18.280]  I'll call them back to Martin in the live show, I promise.
[3:14:18.280 --> 3:14:19.480]  This is high level stuff.
[3:14:19.480 --> 3:14:23.840]  It's way to the Holy Spirit to guide you and realize that God's in control and built
[3:14:23.840 --> 3:14:26.280]  all those only with the Holy Spirit.
[3:14:26.280 --> 3:14:31.280]  And when Jesus Christ, you even deal with this, but that's where we're at.
[3:14:31.280 --> 3:14:32.280]  All right.
[3:14:32.280 --> 3:14:35.880]  I want to thank the great crew for the great job they've done today.
[3:14:35.880 --> 3:14:41.280]  We have Jason Burma's about to take over and then in 45 minutes, we're going to cover this
[3:14:41.280 --> 3:14:48.040]  major press conference on the invasion of the Texas border and what's happening there.
[3:14:48.040 --> 3:14:52.560]  Separately, I want to stay on air forever, but I can't do it without you.

[3:19:41.920 --> 3:19:49.520]  Join Infowarsstore.com and celebrate July 4th, 1776, Part 2 against the New World Order
[3:19:49.520 --> 3:19:58.080]  because the answer to 1984 is 1776.
[3:19:58.080 --> 3:20:26.480]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[3:20:26.480 --> 3:20:27.480]  Heldent.
[3:20:27.480 --> 3:20:38.480]  I'm not just creating a transhumanist future but eventually a post-human world.
[3:20:38.480 --> 3:20:39.880]  Let me repeat that.
[3:20:39.880 --> 3:20:40.880]  Post-human.
[3:20:40.880 --> 3:20:41.880]  We're gone.
[3:20:41.880 --> 3:20:42.880]  It's over.
[3:20:42.880 --> 3:20:51.640]  It's not what I think we as humanity and a society should be striving for.
[3:20:51.640 --> 3:20:59.640]  But I'm going to let you hear it from one of the longest running, highest level scientific
[3:20:59.640 --> 3:21:03.120]  bureaucrats out there, Dennis Bushnell.
[3:21:03.120 --> 3:21:06.480]  This is what we're going to open with and then we're going to get into Bilderberg.
[3:21:06.480 --> 3:21:09.360]  We're going to get into CERN and so much more.
[3:21:09.360 --> 3:21:11.280]  I promise you that.
[3:21:11.280 --> 3:21:16.000]  Talking about this post-human world.
[3:21:16.000 --> 3:21:23.280]  This gentleman is behind such documentations as he is also somebody who has access to the
[3:21:23.280 --> 3:21:30.440]  highest levels of technology that we do not see and the highest levels of experimentation.
[3:21:30.440 --> 3:21:35.920]  The 2001 pre-911 document, Future Strategic Issues and Future Warfare, where they talk
[3:21:35.920 --> 3:21:37.640]  about bringing in what?
[3:21:37.640 --> 3:21:40.520]  A virtual age.
[3:21:40.520 --> 3:21:45.160]  Somehow they knew the bio-nano era would begin in 2020 for humankind.
[3:21:45.160 --> 3:21:49.880]  You can argue that technology was there before humankind, but I know this, there weren't billions
[3:21:49.880 --> 3:21:56.760]  of people being injected with mRNA and vector-based nanotechnology before 2020.
[3:21:56.760 --> 3:21:58.840]  They want to bring you into the virtual age.
[3:21:58.840 --> 3:22:04.680]  And there's even a paper on that, 2020, he writes, this disruptive technologies and
[3:22:04.680 --> 3:22:11.640]  their punitive impacts upon society and aerospace entering the virtual age and you better believe
[3:22:11.640 --> 3:22:17.640]  it is truly about uploading your consciousness if you are one of the plebs.
[3:22:17.640 --> 3:22:20.640]  But at the end of the day, what are we going to create?
[3:22:20.640 --> 3:22:24.880]  At best, folks, he'll tell you, human contaminated machines.
[3:22:24.880 --> 3:22:31.840]  And eventually this all ends up with uploading into the machines and instead of us versus
[3:22:31.840 --> 3:22:38.640]  them, humans versus the machines, we become that or they become us.
[3:22:38.640 --> 3:22:47.920]  Now, I mean, that's definitely what I think we should be striving for, human contaminated
[3:22:47.920 --> 3:22:50.200]  machines.
[3:22:50.200 --> 3:22:52.880]  And why did I talk about the Bilderberg group?
[3:22:52.880 --> 3:22:56.800]  Well, let's incorporate that with the news about CERN.
[3:22:56.800 --> 3:23:04.880]  First of all, this was the first year that Bilderberg met since the COVID-1984 nightmare
[3:23:04.880 --> 3:23:07.480]  that we all experienced, right?
[3:23:07.480 --> 3:23:14.840]  And they kept it secret till the day of and had the balls to run it in DC.
[3:23:14.840 --> 3:23:20.000]  I was ashamed that I wasn't able to get on the ground and cover it because I had literally
[3:23:20.000 --> 3:23:23.600]  no time to plan and had already planned other things.
[3:23:23.600 --> 3:23:26.560]  I've been looking into it every day and why is that?
[3:23:26.560 --> 3:23:28.920]  Well, it's the importance of this.
[3:23:28.920 --> 3:23:34.840]  In 2018, they talked about the post-truth world and you better believe that post-truth
[3:23:34.840 --> 3:23:41.160]  world is how they're going to eventually try to bring in this post-human future.
[3:23:41.160 --> 3:23:46.800]  And the year before that, which I did cover, kind of got me back in the game, also in DC,
[3:23:46.800 --> 3:23:53.000]  this time in Chantilly, Virginia, where it had been previously, right outside of DC.
[3:23:53.000 --> 3:23:56.280]  They had the director of CERN there and it was on the agenda.
[3:23:56.280 --> 3:24:00.960]  And a lot of people forget this and I've always said this about the Large Hadron Collider.
[3:24:00.960 --> 3:24:04.840]  Number one, publicly, how is this part of the agenda?
[3:24:04.840 --> 3:24:08.400]  Well, it's part of the agenda because they're telling you that the Higgs Boston that they
[3:24:08.400 --> 3:24:13.440]  found several times or didn't find or who knows or claimed to have found because you
[3:24:13.440 --> 3:24:15.680]  or I could never discern it, okay?
[3:24:15.680 --> 3:24:20.760]  It's a big nothing burger, in my opinion, is the God Particle.
[3:24:20.760 --> 3:24:24.360]  And this is all about playing and becoming God.
[3:24:24.360 --> 3:24:30.200]  And during that year at Bilderberg, coinciding with that, what did we have?
[3:24:30.200 --> 3:24:35.680]  The announcement, okay, that they were going to build another particle accelerator three
[3:24:35.680 --> 3:24:39.400]  times the size as the Large Hadron Collider.
[3:24:39.400 --> 3:24:46.040]  Now, we've had black sites and underground bases in this country post-World War II like
[3:24:46.040 --> 3:24:48.320]  most of us cannot comprehend.
[3:24:48.320 --> 3:24:54.360]  If you are naive enough to believe that they had an international group build the Large
[3:24:54.360 --> 3:25:02.160]  Hadron Collider before the technology was tested, that's pretty damn naive, in my opinion.
[3:25:02.160 --> 3:25:08.320]  So the rollout of this, okay, again, is that we are becoming the gods and we are finding
[3:25:08.320 --> 3:25:13.640]  out how the very nature of reality and consciousness is made.
[3:25:13.640 --> 3:25:21.400]  And they push you into this multiverse madness and simulation theory, all of which denigrates
[3:25:21.400 --> 3:25:26.640]  you as a flesh and blood human being that has what?
[3:25:26.640 --> 3:25:31.760]  Free will granted to you by some higher entity.
[3:25:31.760 --> 3:25:32.760]  Some people call it God.
[3:25:32.760 --> 3:25:36.440]  I'm not here to preach to you about that, I'm here to show you the facts.
[3:25:36.440 --> 3:25:38.400]  And they want to become those gods.
[3:25:38.400 --> 3:25:44.440]  But at the same time, the technology that will empower them will enslave the rest of
[3:25:44.440 --> 3:25:47.280]  us into believing what?
[3:25:47.280 --> 3:25:50.600]  That we can somehow upload our consciousness.
[3:25:50.600 --> 3:25:57.400]  So CERN in 2017, a lot of people in the artificial intelligence field that year, more people
[3:25:57.400 --> 3:26:02.640]  in the artificial intelligence field than ever at Bilderberg this year.
[3:26:02.640 --> 3:26:04.260]  Why is that important, Jason?
[3:26:04.260 --> 3:26:09.880]  Because again, all of this has to do with quantum computing and what?
[3:26:09.880 --> 3:26:16.480]  Bringing in this AI technology that they say will basically be a better replication of
[3:26:16.480 --> 3:26:18.240]  human beings themselves.
[3:26:18.240 --> 3:26:27.920]  Jan McCoon was the representative of Facebook at Bilderberg 2022, among a slew of others.
[3:26:27.920 --> 3:26:30.160]  Deep Mind was there, of course.
[3:26:30.160 --> 3:26:36.640]  And they, meeting right after Davos, which did not one but two forums on what?
[3:26:36.640 --> 3:26:41.120]  The Metaverse, that's on the World Economic Forum page.
[3:26:41.120 --> 3:26:47.920]  They have a whole thing dedicated to telling you how they're going to help build the Metaverse
[3:26:47.920 --> 3:26:54.840]  from theory to practice, Metaverse governance, and generating economic and societal value.
[3:26:54.840 --> 3:27:04.240]  Oh, the social engineers are here to take you from the track trace database society we
[3:27:04.240 --> 3:27:06.720]  are all living under right now.
[3:27:06.720 --> 3:27:08.880]  It has come to fruition.
[3:27:08.880 --> 3:27:15.440]  Your little magic device, in most cases, unless you've taken many a safeguard, your computer,
[3:27:15.440 --> 3:27:18.960]  the sensors around you, the track trace database is already here.
[3:27:18.960 --> 3:27:23.480]  The next level is to get under your skin, to biometrics, and we're going to show you
[3:27:23.480 --> 3:27:30.240]  blockchain people also announced by the World Economic Forum, get you hooked into this Metaverse,
[3:27:30.240 --> 3:27:32.920]  which will have its own laws, rules, and governance.
[3:27:32.920 --> 3:27:38.720]  I've done several videos on those forums that, again, just took place in 2022.
[3:27:38.720 --> 3:27:44.720]  And then you have Jan McCoon over at Bilderberg with the directors of the CIA.
[3:27:44.720 --> 3:27:50.200]  You know, royalty from the Netherlands, representatives of Goldman Sachs, let's not forget the institutes
[3:27:50.200 --> 3:27:56.680]  like the Hudson Institute, which we'll get into in a little bit, building this social
[3:27:56.680 --> 3:28:06.680]  credit score and digital ID that's going to be involved with your very biological identity.
[3:28:06.680 --> 3:28:11.280]  So on the flip side of this break, we're going to get more into the Hudson Institute Davos
[3:28:11.280 --> 3:28:15.840]  in 2020, forget about the Metaverse this year, okay, in 2022.
[3:28:15.840 --> 3:28:24.520]  But actually, having a full forum, not if, but when, not if, but when humans become cyborgs.
[3:28:24.520 --> 3:28:29.840]  This is a reality, Alex Jones is telling you the truth, so you better buckle the truck
[3:28:29.840 --> 3:28:31.760]  up and listen.
[3:28:31.760 --> 3:28:37.840]  And if you want to support this broadcast, you can do so right now by going over to infowarsstore.com
[3:28:37.840 --> 3:28:45.760]  and making a purchase, making a donation, because independent media needs this voice.
[3:28:45.760 --> 3:28:50.000]  Conservatives, liberals, they're not talking too much about transhumanism.
[3:28:50.000 --> 3:28:53.920]  Alex Jones and the gang are, and we will see you on the flip side.
[3:28:53.920 --> 3:28:58.040]  The globalists are making their move.
[3:28:58.040 --> 3:28:59.960]  Their great reset is here.
[3:28:59.960 --> 3:29:01.480]  They're coming for your children.
[3:29:01.480 --> 3:29:03.800]  They're coming for the value of your currency.
[3:29:03.800 --> 3:29:05.920]  They're coming for your national sovereignty.
[3:29:05.920 --> 3:29:10.600]  They're coming for your very bodies with their biomedical tyranny.
[3:29:10.600 --> 3:29:12.920]  They're coming for your free speech.
[3:29:12.920 --> 3:29:14.920]  They're coming for your privacy.
[3:29:14.920 --> 3:29:19.720]  And ladies and gentlemen, they're coming for your right to vote and have your representative
[3:29:19.720 --> 3:29:23.160]  in government that you and your fellow Americans choose.
[3:29:23.160 --> 3:29:28.880]  The new film, the seminal film, the most important documentary ever made in my view, 2000 Mules,
[3:29:28.880 --> 3:29:34.400]  is now available on DVD with expanded extras at infowarsstore.com.

[3:29:51.680 --> 3:29:56.480]  action, infowarsstore.com, 2000 Mules.

[3:32:48.600 --> 3:32:57.200]  the New World Order because the answer to 1984 is 1776.
[3:32:57.200 --> 3:33:12.480]  Meeting of frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[3:33:12.480 --> 3:33:13.480]  We are back.
[3:33:13.480 --> 3:33:18.200]  I am Jason Burma sitting in for the fourth hour of the Alex Jones show.
[3:33:18.200 --> 3:33:25.240]  And just as we showed you that this transhumanism is being pushed on the next level, I want
[3:33:25.240 --> 3:33:33.360]  to show you how the World Economic Forum is the mouthpiece for this digital slavery and
[3:33:33.360 --> 3:33:40.160]  identity under the guise of, of course, benevolence and helping people.
[3:33:40.160 --> 3:33:42.480]  And you know, it's got the nice little backbeat music.
[3:33:42.480 --> 3:33:46.160]  We'll play it for the radio listeners as I tell you what's going on.
[3:33:46.160 --> 3:33:52.560]  But they're showing you already a refugee camp that runs on the blockchain.
[3:33:52.560 --> 3:33:57.120]  And believe me, they want these nice little refugee camps globalized.
[3:33:57.120 --> 3:34:02.080]  I know we can't envision it here in the United States because we've had it pretty damn good
[3:34:02.080 --> 3:34:04.840]  for pretty damn long.
[3:34:04.840 --> 3:34:12.520]  But what the viewers are seeing are what, tents and a multitude of desperate human beings
[3:34:12.520 --> 3:34:14.360]  that will do anything to eat.
[3:34:14.360 --> 3:34:19.240]  And that's a good thing because they're about to give up their entire biometric identity
[3:34:19.240 --> 3:34:20.240]  to do so.
[3:34:20.240 --> 3:34:25.960]  So, as you look at this and they're walking around, it tells you that there's supermarkets
[3:34:25.960 --> 3:34:28.840]  without any physical money, isn't that lovely?
[3:34:28.840 --> 3:34:30.560]  And they can pay by looking into the camera.
[3:34:30.560 --> 3:34:32.640]  We'll just take your iris scan, lovely.
[3:34:32.640 --> 3:34:35.360]  The iris scanner is part of the World Food Program account, right?
[3:34:35.360 --> 3:34:40.480]  Remember, we did this in Afghanistan and it could also help them find work, you know,
[3:34:40.480 --> 3:34:42.720]  within this slave chain system.
[3:34:42.720 --> 3:34:47.960]  Store someone's digital identity, you know, your paperwork, like your vaccine passports,
[3:34:47.960 --> 3:34:53.000]  your exam certificates and your financial history, you know, in places that are destroyed
[3:34:53.000 --> 3:34:57.560]  by conflict or seized by hostile governments, okay?
[3:34:57.560 --> 3:35:05.720]  And again, these are the zeros and ones that the SDR was via the IMF, but now it will run
[3:35:05.720 --> 3:35:08.000]  on blockchain technology.
[3:35:08.000 --> 3:35:12.440]  They talk about Ripple or XRP because you won't need banks or cash and it could be
[3:35:12.440 --> 3:35:21.000]  indebted directly to your World Food Program account, lovely stuff, lovely stuff.
[3:35:21.000 --> 3:35:28.600]  And all this stuff being accelerated via this COVID-1984 nightmare.
[3:35:28.600 --> 3:35:31.960]  You know, I don't want to play the whole thing here, but we're going to try to play a little
[3:35:31.960 --> 3:35:37.640]  bit of it and just show you how NASA uses their technology to track and trace you when
[3:35:37.640 --> 3:35:40.640]  you're nice and masked up, okay?
[3:35:40.640 --> 3:35:42.840]  Right here, check this out, okay?
[3:35:42.840 --> 3:35:47.440]  Now, since we plan on locking you down and making you wear masks periodically through
[3:35:47.440 --> 3:35:51.600]  the rest of your life, albeit a short one on the road to transhumanism in this virtual
[3:35:51.600 --> 3:35:56.840]  age, yuck-a-yuck-a-yuck-a, we're going to need something better than facial recognition.
[3:35:56.840 --> 3:36:00.720]  So we'll use your heartbeat from NASA technology, right?
[3:36:00.720 --> 3:36:04.400]  Because these masks, they block a lot of that facial recognition.
[3:36:04.400 --> 3:36:10.160]  It's unique as your face and again, those good people at NASA have invented that because
[3:36:10.160 --> 3:36:15.600]  NASA is a front for the military-industrial complex.
[3:36:15.600 --> 3:36:21.120]  The gentleman that we played before and we'll play more clips of has it been a bureaucratic
[3:36:21.120 --> 3:36:27.680]  around since before Apollo, all the way back in the Gemini days?
[3:36:27.680 --> 3:36:33.400]  And this document is truly a blueprint for the last 20-plus years.
[3:36:33.400 --> 3:36:37.320]  Let's just go over some of the things that they were able to predict.
[3:36:37.320 --> 3:36:41.040]  Meanwhile, you talk about the manipulation of media, digital armies, we can talk about
[3:36:41.040 --> 3:36:43.000]  signature reduction, okay?
[3:36:43.000 --> 3:36:48.800]  Not just digital armies, but on the ground, people getting past the biometric technology,
[3:36:48.800 --> 3:36:49.800]  okay?
[3:36:49.800 --> 3:36:54.160]  That's real and it's barely been talked about and it needs to be talked about more.
[3:36:54.160 --> 3:36:57.160]  So exploit CNN syndrome.
[3:36:57.160 --> 3:36:59.160]  This is July 2001.
[3:36:59.160 --> 3:37:04.560]  Capture and torture Americans in living color on prime time, terror attacks within the
[3:37:04.560 --> 3:37:10.520]  continental United States, binary, a biological, critical infrastructure takedowns, internet
[3:37:10.520 --> 3:37:11.720]  warfare.
[3:37:11.720 --> 3:37:12.720]  You see it?
[3:37:12.720 --> 3:37:17.560]  Serious PSY war and collateral damage exploitation.
[3:37:17.560 --> 3:37:18.560]  Let me show you what that means.
[3:37:18.560 --> 3:37:21.200]  If you're watching, there it is.
[3:37:21.200 --> 3:37:25.880]  That's the CNN syndrome, pre-9-11 into 9-11, okay?
[3:37:25.880 --> 3:37:27.120]  You get it?
[3:37:27.120 --> 3:37:33.120]  Use the collateral damage of 3,000-plus Americans to launch a war on terror where you got to
[3:37:33.120 --> 3:37:39.040]  beta test all your fun little technology such as smart dust, which is in this again and
[3:37:39.040 --> 3:37:40.040]  again.
[3:37:40.040 --> 3:37:41.040]  Okay?
[3:37:41.040 --> 3:37:42.360]  See that smart dust?
[3:37:42.360 --> 3:37:44.040]  The Bionano sensors?
[3:37:44.040 --> 3:37:45.200]  Read Annie Jacobson.
[3:37:45.200 --> 3:37:48.080]  She talks all about it, okay?
[3:37:48.080 --> 3:37:49.960]  All about it.
[3:37:49.960 --> 3:37:55.960]  Combined sensors, comms, and power supplies, nanotags, co-opted insects, all a reality.
[3:37:55.960 --> 3:37:58.280]  None of this is pixie dust as they tell you.
[3:37:58.280 --> 3:38:01.680]  In fact, we'll show you that just so you understand.
[3:38:01.680 --> 3:38:08.800]  All this is based on real technology, real data, real analysis, real trends, no pixie
[3:38:08.800 --> 3:38:09.800]  dust.
[3:38:09.800 --> 3:38:10.800]  You know why?
[3:38:10.800 --> 3:38:17.480]  Because they have this stuff in about 15-plus years, and then they keep it in inventory
[3:38:17.480 --> 3:38:25.640]  for 40-plus, and they use their Trojan horse civilian systems, as you'll see, to manipulate
[3:38:25.640 --> 3:38:32.840]  the public through what, inexpensive information, internet, and psychological warfare.
[3:38:32.840 --> 3:38:37.640]  And remember, this man is telling you, we're bringing you into the virtual age, you will
[3:38:37.640 --> 3:38:39.920]  upload your consciousness.
[3:38:39.920 --> 3:38:46.960]  So before we get to him talking about, okay, this very fact in 2018, and that we already
[3:38:46.960 --> 3:38:54.280]  have in the world 200,000 or so people with brain chips, human brain interfaces, okay,
[3:38:54.280 --> 3:38:58.760]  something you can look into with the Rand Corporation, really important document, kind
[3:38:58.760 --> 3:39:04.000]  of short, 45 pages, anybody could read it, stunning stuff in here, goes well beyond the
[3:39:04.000 --> 3:39:09.720]  type of comms and neural-link technology, and one of my big contentions with Musk, among
[3:39:09.720 --> 3:39:10.720]  other things.
[3:39:10.720 --> 3:39:15.320]  You can watch all videos on every subject we've seen here today, folks, by the way.
[3:39:15.320 --> 3:39:19.920]  So let's, before we get to him, have Davos tell you how happy they're going to be.
[3:39:19.920 --> 3:39:21.400]  Look how excited this woman is.
[3:39:21.400 --> 3:39:27.320]  She's really excited, like over the top excited, about becoming a cyborg, okay?
[3:39:27.320 --> 3:39:28.320]  That's what we want to hear.
[3:39:28.320 --> 3:39:29.320]  That's what we want to see.
[3:39:29.320 --> 3:39:36.240]  We're going to start the, when humans become cyborg session, you know, I always want to
[3:39:36.240 --> 3:39:37.240]  be a cyborg.
[3:39:37.240 --> 3:39:42.280]  I'm waiting for the day to become one, but let's see, like today, we like to...
[3:39:42.280 --> 3:39:43.960]  I mean, wow!
[3:39:43.960 --> 3:39:47.160]  And in this, by the way, they talk about smart drugs.
[3:39:47.160 --> 3:39:52.840]  These are biometric drugs that you'll have to take, right, and they will give off sensors
[3:39:52.840 --> 3:39:57.480]  if you do not, and they will know not only when it is deployed, but what the effects
[3:39:57.480 --> 3:40:00.880]  are on your body, lovely stuff.
[3:40:00.880 --> 3:40:05.880]  And even collective swarm intelligence is the stuff, right here, okay?
[3:40:05.880 --> 3:40:10.960]  Insects, bugs, you noticed, co-opted insects, you see how drones are now being declassified
[3:40:10.960 --> 3:40:15.480]  that work in this manner, and if you don't think that they're going to try to incorporate
[3:40:15.480 --> 3:40:19.260]  biologics into this, you're not paying attention.
[3:40:19.260 --> 3:40:23.440]  So I'm going to take you back, because we have the smart drugs, right?
[3:40:23.440 --> 3:40:28.320]  Let's hear what Herman Kahn, you know, one of the guys that was an inspiration mentors
[3:40:28.320 --> 3:40:35.200]  for Klaus Schwab, had to say what you could do to a society all the way back in the day,
[3:40:35.200 --> 3:40:41.960]  and by the way, the Hudson Institute also represented it at Bilderberg 2022.
[3:40:41.960 --> 3:40:49.920]  Thirty miles north of New York City, the problems of our violent age are pondered over in one
[3:40:49.920 --> 3:40:55.680]  of America's most influential think tanks, the Hudson Institute.
[3:40:55.680 --> 3:41:01.240]  In this 19th century mansion, they are looking for alternative futures, both utopian and
[3:41:01.240 --> 3:41:02.920]  dystopian.
[3:41:02.920 --> 3:41:08.800]  The end product of this think tank, scenarios, scripts for the 21st century.
[3:41:08.800 --> 3:41:14.920]  You know, let's admit that the affluence, the skills, technology will really make life
[3:41:14.920 --> 3:41:16.920]  better in all kinds of ways.
[3:41:16.920 --> 3:41:25.480]  But you know, we also know these things go badly, okay, everybody's worried about the
[3:41:25.480 --> 3:41:29.200]  possibilities of various kinds of social controls and so on.
[3:41:29.200 --> 3:41:30.960]  What would the scenario be?
[3:41:30.960 --> 3:41:34.760]  Herman Kahn is director of the institute, Tony Wiener, his assistant.
[3:41:34.760 --> 3:41:41.800]  He has to involve the social controls coming into effect gradually and slowly and at each
[3:41:41.800 --> 3:41:46.840]  step as a result of some decision which seems to be very much in the general interest.
[3:41:46.840 --> 3:41:47.840]  Problem reaction solution?
[3:41:47.840 --> 3:41:54.160]  There is no imposition by an evil, evilly intended big brother.
[3:41:54.160 --> 3:41:58.600]  How are we going to achieve a utopian peace in our cities, even without the bomb?
[3:41:58.600 --> 3:42:01.240]  What is the scenario for a utopian peace?
[3:42:01.240 --> 3:42:06.360]  To take a black power movement, and one which really is trying to cause problems, but sand
[3:42:06.360 --> 3:42:07.360]  and the gears.
[3:42:07.360 --> 3:42:08.360]  Right.
[3:42:08.360 --> 3:42:13.640]  And you've already set up a good deal of the social watching, you know, you've got your
[3:42:13.640 --> 3:42:17.920]  TV cameras everywhere, you've got your data processing, everybody has his ID card, you've
[3:42:17.920 --> 3:42:22.080]  double checked it, and now all of a sudden you've got these guys that are throwing sand
[3:42:22.080 --> 3:42:27.920]  and the gears and you clamp down, that is you keep track of every car, you keep track
[3:42:27.920 --> 3:42:30.040]  of every, it is easy to do.
[3:42:30.040 --> 3:42:35.520]  You keep track of the 10% or 100% of the conversation that occurred on telephones.
[3:42:35.520 --> 3:42:40.960]  And they did do that by the way, hepting versus AT&T revealed, that was going on pre-911.
[3:42:40.960 --> 3:42:46.440]  They're going to move from track trace database, what, into the biomedical society.

[3:45:57.760 --> 3:46:01.640]  Everybody else is just like yellow or clear and that's because it's been denatured, it's
[3:46:01.640 --> 3:46:02.640]  been worked out.
[3:46:02.640 --> 3:46:05.240]  We didn't do that.
[3:46:05.240 --> 3:46:09.080]  You think I would metaphysically tell you something that this is the very best I can
[3:46:09.080 --> 3:46:10.080]  get?
[3:46:10.080 --> 3:46:11.840]  I'd rather go to hell and do that.

[3:46:17.880 --> 3:46:21.080]  I want that good will.
[3:46:21.080 --> 3:46:24.080]  What I do to you, I do to myself, don't you get the big secret?
[3:46:24.080 --> 3:46:26.680]  You ever seen fish oil look like that?
[3:46:26.680 --> 3:46:28.680]  No, you never seen that, have you?
[3:46:28.680 --> 3:46:35.680]  And this little jewel right here is solid, liquid consciousness.
[3:46:35.680 --> 3:46:46.960]  Look it up, find out how even the FDA and the government admits fish oil is incredible.
[3:46:46.960 --> 3:46:52.520]  The number one thing anybody can do for themselves is take the fish oil or krill oil just like
[3:46:52.520 --> 3:46:57.520]  our information is dynamite so are our products InfoWarsStore.com.
[3:46:57.520 --> 3:47:15.400]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[3:47:15.400 --> 3:47:25.600]  We are back and basically Herman Kahn is the inspiration for Dr. Strangel, he was a friend
[3:47:25.600 --> 3:47:33.160]  of Stanley Kubrick and I want to move into Jeffrey Epstein after what?
[3:47:33.160 --> 3:47:40.720]  After Herman Kahn explains to you about the peasant class and how we can drug them.
[3:47:40.720 --> 3:47:45.080]  One could with a computer capacity that will be available in the next couple of decades,
[3:47:45.080 --> 3:47:52.920]  one could easily record every phone conversation made and then one could easily scan mechanically
[3:47:52.920 --> 3:47:57.360]  no human being could spend the centuries that would be required.
[3:47:57.360 --> 3:48:02.200]  One could scan every conversation looking for keywords that would identify the conversation
[3:48:02.200 --> 3:48:04.480]  as worth looking into a little further.
[3:48:04.480 --> 3:48:06.760]  And by the way, that's Promise and Carnivore.
[3:48:06.760 --> 3:48:11.880]  Look up hepting versus AT&T, look up Promise and Carnivore software, watch Invisible Empire
[3:48:11.880 --> 3:48:17.240]  in New World Order to find produced by InfoWars and it talks about all these things.
[3:48:17.240 --> 3:48:26.880]  So that, for example, one could begin with a naive set of words, kill, rob, murder, assassinate,
[3:48:26.880 --> 3:48:29.880]  plot, conspire.
[3:48:29.880 --> 3:48:35.080]  You know, more than that, you could imagine temporarily tranquilizing the whole city.
[3:48:35.080 --> 3:48:39.480]  Oh, we could just temporarily tranquilize the whole city.
[3:48:39.480 --> 3:48:45.360]  You know, we've been upset, been riots, you know, let's put trans carers either in the
[3:48:45.360 --> 3:48:50.640]  air or in the water, you know, just get people settled down a bit.
[3:48:50.640 --> 3:48:54.200]  I could imagine you could do preventive medicine going on at this kind of state, you know,
[3:48:54.200 --> 3:48:57.560]  where you really check up with everybody and you see that they keep their drug levels
[3:48:57.560 --> 3:48:58.560]  right.
[3:48:58.560 --> 3:48:59.560]  Yes.
[3:48:59.560 --> 3:49:03.840]  In fact, the first thing you do when you go into work is they punch you and check your
[3:49:03.840 --> 3:49:05.840]  blood and see that the drug level is what it's supposed to be.
[3:49:05.840 --> 3:49:07.200]  See, they don't even have to do that anymore.
[3:49:07.200 --> 3:49:09.400]  You know, they, you know, put drugs everywhere.
[3:49:09.400 --> 3:49:15.560]  They don't even have to do that anymore if they have the biometric nanotag sensors.
[3:49:15.560 --> 3:49:20.720]  But these are frank discussions and again, these are the people that end up going to
[3:49:20.720 --> 3:49:21.720]  Bilderberg.
[3:49:21.720 --> 3:49:28.480]  So you'll, you'll buy the safety of your city at the expense of the privacy of individuals
[3:49:28.480 --> 3:49:33.080]  and for most people, most of the time, the intrusion will not be the kind of thing that
[3:49:33.080 --> 3:49:34.080]  would be conscious of.
[3:49:34.080 --> 3:49:35.760]  So the scenario for it.
[3:49:35.760 --> 3:49:37.920]  So they wouldn't even be conscious of it.
[3:49:37.920 --> 3:49:38.920]  Weird.
[3:49:38.920 --> 3:49:43.400]  So before I go into Epstein and how one of the aspects that they don't talk about this
[3:49:43.400 --> 3:49:48.800]  human trafficking is the baby making ranch, okay, the biomedical things that were going
[3:49:48.800 --> 3:49:54.720]  on over at New Mexico, people like Peter Nygaard, who are in prison in Toronto, two more sexual
[3:49:54.720 --> 3:50:02.200]  assault charges just in the last few weeks, who was having his girlfriends have abortions
[3:50:02.200 --> 3:50:07.360]  so he could use the stem cells to extend his life.
[3:50:07.360 --> 3:50:08.520]  Okay.
[3:50:08.520 --> 3:50:13.440]  So I want to also get into that Ghislaine Maxwell and the meme of the client list guys.
[3:50:13.440 --> 3:50:14.440]  There is no client list.
[3:50:14.440 --> 3:50:19.040]  He was connected to a ton of people, many of which he had blackmail on what there are
[3:50:19.040 --> 3:50:24.960]  are videos, photographs and digital evidence of what massive child abuse and there should
[3:50:24.960 --> 3:50:27.040]  be massive arrests.
[3:50:27.040 --> 3:50:28.600]  We'll show you that in a moment.
[3:50:28.600 --> 3:50:35.040]  But here is Dennis Bushnell again, the guy behind two of those documents that we discussed
[3:50:35.040 --> 3:50:39.680]  talking about transhumanism.
[3:50:39.680 --> 3:50:42.560]  Humans are now becoming cyborgs.
[3:50:42.560 --> 3:50:50.160]  We have cochlear implants to hear artificial retinas to say artificial hearts to live artificial
[3:50:50.160 --> 3:50:54.840]  limbs to move artificial organs to functions and brain shins.
[3:50:54.840 --> 3:50:59.600]  There's a couple hundred thousand people wandering around with brain shifts now affects congenital
[3:50:59.600 --> 3:51:05.160]  or defective brains and increasingly to fix memory and other things, darkness work on
[3:51:05.160 --> 3:51:11.800]  our brain shifts for super soldiers and people are now working thanks to Musk and other people
[3:51:11.800 --> 3:51:17.800]  funding on direct machine brain communications.
[3:51:17.800 --> 3:51:22.520]  It's not us versus them, us versus the machines we're merging.
[3:51:22.520 --> 3:51:27.000]  And this is the human evolution of the humans.
[3:51:27.000 --> 3:51:37.600]  There is no more natural evolution of anything.
[3:51:37.600 --> 3:51:41.240]  There is no more natural evolution of anything.
[3:51:41.240 --> 3:51:42.960]  We are the gods now.
[3:51:42.960 --> 3:51:45.280]  We have taken over.
[3:51:45.280 --> 3:51:47.520]  Do you understand what that means?
[3:51:47.520 --> 3:51:54.040]  And we have to understand that they've had chimeric experiments for some time.
[3:51:54.040 --> 3:51:58.080]  And now they're polling us saying, you know, we're ready for this.
[3:51:58.080 --> 3:51:59.480]  We're ready for this.
[3:51:59.480 --> 3:52:06.640]  And that's what this transgender movement is about, non-binary, zeros and ones.
[3:52:06.640 --> 3:52:10.640]  There is no justice system currently, okay?
[3:52:10.640 --> 3:52:12.480]  You look at the evidence they had on Epstein.
[3:52:12.480 --> 3:52:18.120]  They showed you pictures of hard drives, not what was on the hard drives.
[3:52:18.120 --> 3:52:25.240]  They showed you a safe, not the contents of the safe, a.k.a. the photographs and videos
[3:52:25.240 --> 3:52:30.160]  that were reported to have been in there, along with the passport, okay?
[3:52:30.160 --> 3:52:35.000]  They showed you pictures of burned DVDs, not the material on them.
[3:52:35.000 --> 3:52:39.440]  They showed you that there were binders full of material, that they blacked out in many
[3:52:39.440 --> 3:52:42.840]  cases the information on the sides.
[3:52:42.840 --> 3:52:43.840]  That's what they showed you.
[3:52:43.840 --> 3:52:53.280]  This whole meme, okay, this whole meme, this whole idea of what, of a list, guys, there's
[3:52:53.280 --> 3:52:54.880]  a ton of evidence.
[3:52:54.880 --> 3:53:00.040]  They weren't going to bring in Jeffrey Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell unless the cover-up
[3:53:00.040 --> 3:53:02.520]  crew had it all.
[3:53:02.520 --> 3:53:08.960]  And you know, to talk about Nygard for a moment, I want to play yet another clip here of this
[3:53:08.960 --> 3:53:14.440]  is actually of Chris Hansen, the have a seat guy who's done some great independent reporting
[3:53:14.440 --> 3:53:16.560]  on this subject, okay?
[3:53:16.560 --> 3:53:18.480]  And he was talking about what?
[3:53:18.480 --> 3:53:25.480]  Peter Nygard and this quest for immortality through taking his victims of abuse, many
[3:53:25.480 --> 3:53:27.840]  of them underage, right?
[3:53:27.840 --> 3:53:34.600]  Many of them underage and making them take the stem cells from their aborted fetuses.
[3:53:34.600 --> 3:53:39.120]  I mean, this stuff is about as dark as it gets, folks.
[3:53:39.120 --> 3:53:40.120]  Probably because of the circles.
[3:53:40.120 --> 3:53:41.120]  Right.
[3:53:41.120 --> 3:53:44.040]  And I go, I have nothing to do with that, so I never heard that.
[3:53:44.040 --> 3:53:49.800]  So when I heard about all the underage stuff, it was like, okay, this is way more serious.
[3:53:49.800 --> 3:53:54.400]  I just thought it was some old guy who just liked a lot of girls around.
[3:53:54.400 --> 3:53:57.840]  But ultimately, there were some really interesting stories about abortions.
[3:53:57.840 --> 3:54:00.840]  Can you explain that?
[3:54:00.840 --> 3:54:06.880]  He was obsessed, Peter Nygard was, with stem cell research and anything that he could get
[3:54:06.880 --> 3:54:14.080]  his hands on to preserve his health and youth and to create longevity.
[3:54:14.080 --> 3:54:20.400]  And according to many people involved in the investigation, he actually would impregnate
[3:54:20.400 --> 3:54:27.480]  underage girls, have them get abortions, and then harvest the stem cells of the fetuses
[3:54:27.480 --> 3:54:33.280]  to inject in himself under the belief that it would be more beneficial than random stem
[3:54:33.280 --> 3:54:36.600]  cells from another source.
[3:54:36.600 --> 3:54:43.640]  And that he would go to China and other countries to learn how to do this and have it done.
[3:54:43.640 --> 3:54:51.480]  And the underage aspect of this is a big part of the investigation, too, but that's how
[3:54:51.480 --> 3:54:56.000]  far he would allegedly go.
[3:54:56.000 --> 3:55:02.640]  And this is somebody, again, who had islands, who was doing this type of experimentation
[3:55:02.640 --> 3:55:03.640]  on top.
[3:55:03.640 --> 3:55:12.360]  So you have this class of people that's into trafficking children, arms dealing, right?
[3:55:12.360 --> 3:55:19.320]  Biomedical tyranny, human experimentation, transhumanism, drugging the population, and
[3:55:19.320 --> 3:55:21.440]  eventually what?
[3:55:21.440 --> 3:55:23.560]  Trying to hit that singularity.
[3:55:23.560 --> 3:55:30.240]  But really what's going on is they're trying to sell you on the fact that you're the problem.
[3:55:30.240 --> 3:55:31.600]  There is no God.
[3:55:31.600 --> 3:55:33.400]  We don't really have a purpose.
[3:55:33.400 --> 3:55:39.560]  We're nothing more than zeros and ones that are producing this evil material called carbon
[3:55:39.560 --> 3:55:41.560]  that's taking out the planet.
[3:55:41.560 --> 3:55:44.240]  So you need to reduce your standard of living.
[3:55:44.240 --> 3:55:49.880]  You need to hook in to the multiverse, getting you ready for that virtual era where your
[3:55:49.880 --> 3:55:57.520]  dopamine comes from, what, not human interactions anymore, but digital ones.
[3:55:57.520 --> 3:56:01.360]  Most of the time with artificial intelligence, because if you think you're dealing with bots
[3:56:01.360 --> 3:56:06.880]  now on Twitter, wait till you get to the metaverse.
[3:56:06.880 --> 3:56:10.920]  And then you're tricked into believing, well, maybe I can actually upload my consciousness
[3:56:10.920 --> 3:56:17.440]  and leave my physical body and identify as a six-winged butterfly unicorn with a leprechaun
[3:56:17.440 --> 3:56:21.440]  riding on the back over a rainbow into a pot of gold.
[3:56:21.440 --> 3:56:26.040]  Maybe you can identify as that, but that's not reality.
[3:56:26.040 --> 3:56:29.080]  And meanwhile, are you being sold on that?
[3:56:29.080 --> 3:56:32.360]  The real-life extension technology, where's it going?
[3:56:32.360 --> 3:56:37.520]  It's going right to the predator class where they think they're going to become gods in
[3:56:37.520 --> 3:56:39.520]  this post-human future.
[3:56:39.520 --> 3:56:43.440]  Folks, I really hope that you enjoyed the fourth hour today.
[3:56:43.440 --> 3:56:48.240]  If you want to see more of this stuff, well, we're censored a lot on YouTube, so we got
[3:56:48.240 --> 3:56:49.720]  some other links over here.
[3:56:49.720 --> 3:56:52.720]  You can check me out over at The Rock Fiend.
[3:56:52.720 --> 3:56:54.520]  We got Podbean.
[3:56:54.520 --> 3:56:55.520]  We're rumbling.
[3:56:55.520 --> 3:56:59.800]  Please give me a follow over at Rumble as well.
[3:56:59.800 --> 3:57:04.320]  Most all watch the documentary films, three of which were produced by Infowars.com itself
[3:57:04.320 --> 3:57:07.360]  and Alex Jones, a big feature in Shade the Motion Picture.
[3:57:07.360 --> 3:57:10.920]  If you want to know more about this stuff, it's Invisible Empire, a new world order to
[3:57:10.920 --> 3:57:17.560]  Shade the Motion Picture, Fabled Enemies, and Loose Change Final Cut 9-11, still a real
[3:57:17.560 --> 3:57:23.280]  issue and one of the big building blocks and stepping stones to how we got here.
[3:57:23.280 --> 3:57:29.280]  Reminder, you can support Alex Jones right now by going to InfowarsStore.com, buying
[3:57:29.280 --> 3:57:36.200]  their great products or just making a straight donation in the name of free speech.
[3:57:36.200 --> 3:57:38.760]  Guys, thank you so much for joining me.
[3:57:38.760 --> 3:57:40.240]  For me, it's never about left and right.
[3:57:40.240 --> 3:57:41.800]  It's always about right and wrong.
[3:57:41.800 --> 3:57:46.400]  I love you, and I will see you on the flip side.
[3:57:46.400 --> 3:57:53.120]  At this point, best case scenario is a few years of hard times for us all, and if we
[3:57:53.120 --> 3:57:57.160]  don't turn it around soon, then it will only get worse.
[3:57:57.160 --> 3:58:02.920]  But as bad as things are, we still have time to prepare, and that alone is something to
[3:58:02.920 --> 3:58:04.360]  be grateful for.
[3:58:04.360 --> 3:58:09.840]  A gravity water filter will provide you with clean, healthy water, even in the event of
[3:58:09.840 --> 3:58:15.640]  your taps getting shut off, and having your own food will save you from getting ensnared

[3:58:49.880 --> 3:58:54.000]  You have made history in your support of Info Wars, and one of the biggest tools we've had
[3:58:54.000 --> 3:58:59.640]  to circumvent and override the sensors has been Patriot Apparel, so we can identify each
[3:58:59.640 --> 3:59:04.440]  other, so we can spread the word, and so we can push people to websites like InfoWars.com
[3:59:04.440 --> 3:59:07.320]  so they can understand the globalist plan and how to stop it.
[3:59:07.320 --> 3:59:10.680]  Now, ladies and gentlemen, two months ago we announced we're blowing out of all of our
[3:59:10.680 --> 3:59:14.400]  designs of t-shirts, some of which go back more than 25 years.
[3:59:14.400 --> 3:59:15.400]  All these shirts are limited edition.
[3:59:15.400 --> 3:59:19.840]  They are about to be history, and will only exist in your closet, your drawer, or your
[3:59:19.840 --> 3:59:20.840]  wardrobe.
[3:59:20.840 --> 3:59:24.440]  So, there's only 15,000 shirts of 60 plus thousand left.
[3:59:24.440 --> 3:59:27.040]  In a couple weeks, they'll all be gone, and they'll be history.
[3:59:27.040 --> 3:59:31.840]  We're selling them all at cost at infowarstore.com.
