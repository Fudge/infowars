[00:00.000 --> 00:29.680]  Ladies and gentlemen, the ramifications that the Biden crime family have caused
[00:29.680 --> 00:37.600]  not just the United States of America, but the world are really starting to be seen and
[00:37.600 --> 00:45.680]  understood. And that's why Albania has launched criminal investigations into Anthony Blinken
[00:46.400 --> 00:50.720]  for his involvement, not just with the Biden administration, but his involvement over the
[00:50.720 --> 00:58.480]  years with the Joe Biden crime family acting as a foreign agent, not just an intermediary
[00:58.480 --> 01:05.040]  with the Penn Biden Center and China, but also with a seriously corrupt situation that's been
[01:05.040 --> 01:13.440]  going on in Albania. Now over the years, and guess who's funding the whole thing? George Soros
[01:14.960 --> 01:20.240]  funding Blinken, funding Communists in Albania, and now they're pushing back and launching
[01:20.240 --> 01:32.400]  investigations. But that's just one angle of this story. We now have connections with the
[01:32.400 --> 01:40.480]  Bidens to biological research facilities that now some believe, including Russia's intelligence
[01:40.480 --> 01:46.640]  believes was actually responsible for the COVID-19 outbreak. And while at first glance,
[01:46.640 --> 01:52.800]  with a story that went viral two days ago, why the origins of COVID-19 are still a mystery,
[01:52.800 --> 01:55.600]  and I thought they're not a mystery. We know it came out of the Chinese lab, but I had to
[01:55.600 --> 02:01.680]  check myself and say, well, you know, I guess we really don't know that. I mean, we have all the
[02:01.680 --> 02:07.360]  circumstantial evidence, but maybe it could have come out of a lab in Ukraine. We do know it was
[02:07.360 --> 02:14.720]  made in a lab, though. And then you've got the situation now with the war in Ukraine and it
[02:14.720 --> 02:23.120]  all being tied into that. But before we go there, this Biden crime family is in serious trouble.
[02:23.120 --> 02:28.320]  Joe Biden claims he doesn't even know he's being investigated, then goes on to lie about his Amtrak
[02:28.320 --> 02:35.760]  story again. Here's James Comer discussing the investigations now ongoing into the Biden crime
[02:35.760 --> 02:40.800]  family. Now, what's different with Joe Biden is we're investigating the Biden family for influence
[02:40.800 --> 02:48.480]  peddling. We have a strong suspicion that people around Joe Biden, mainly in his family, have been
[02:48.480 --> 02:52.960]  peddling access to the Biden family with our adversaries around the world. When we find out
[02:52.960 --> 03:00.320]  that they have multiple classified documents scattered throughout multiple residences and
[03:00.320 --> 03:07.120]  office buildings across the East Coast, then this raises a huge red flag for us. We want to make sure
[03:07.120 --> 03:15.040]  that those documents in the possession of Joe Biden weren't somehow sent to our adversaries and
[03:15.040 --> 03:20.240]  didn't somehow compromise our national security. But you've also talked about how you worried about
[03:20.240 --> 03:24.640]  the same situation with the Trump family. Trump had 300-plus documents in Mar-a-Lago. Why don't
[03:24.640 --> 03:28.800]  you have that same concern? I mean, there are visitors going in and out of Mar-a-Lago from
[03:28.800 --> 03:33.040]  different countries. As if Trump isn't already being investigated. As if Trump already hasn't
[03:33.040 --> 03:39.200]  been investigated. And it was in an unsecure location at Mar-a-Lago. Would you apply that
[03:39.200 --> 03:46.560]  same concern evenly across the board? If someone can show me evidence that there was influence
[03:46.560 --> 03:51.440]  peddling with those classified documents that were in the possession of President Trump,
[03:51.440 --> 03:57.120]  then we would certainly expand that Chinese file was in Mar-a-Lago. But do you have evidence
[03:57.120 --> 04:07.360]  of influence peddling with the classified documents? Yes, the Penn-Biden Center. Millions
[04:07.360 --> 04:10.960]  of dollars coming in from China. It sounds like you don't. You're looking into it, but why wouldn't
[04:10.960 --> 04:17.600]  you look into it in the same way? We have evidence that the Biden family has been very cozy with
[04:17.600 --> 04:22.880]  people from the Chinese Communist Party. We have evidence that Honor Biden was receiving
[04:22.880 --> 04:29.280]  payments that were that were linked directly to the Chinese Communist Party through those
[04:29.280 --> 04:33.760]  Chinese energy companies. We're very concerned about all the money. But how is that connected
[04:33.760 --> 04:39.120]  to classified documents? Amazing. All right, so that's Pamela Brown on CNN. I mean,
[04:39.680 --> 04:43.440]  first of all, it becomes an issue where I have to correct everything she says because it's
[04:43.440 --> 04:48.960]  inaccurate. But she probably genuinely has no clue what's going on. I mean, that's your MSNBC host
[04:48.960 --> 04:56.320]  making seven figures and genuinely doesn't have a clue what's even going on in the country she
[04:56.320 --> 05:15.600]  reports news in. CNN. Hey, what's up? Hey, McBreen, what's going on, man? Hey, really like that work
[05:15.600 --> 05:20.320]  you did on the AI piece. I'm going to use that on the show today. I worked hard on that. I'm
[05:20.320 --> 05:24.000]  working on another project. So I'm going to be up late again tonight. I was hoping he had some
[05:24.000 --> 05:46.400]  Brain Force Plus. Oh, um, no. No, nothing. What about Brain Force Ultra? Thanks anyway. Yeah. Good
[05:46.400 --> 05:54.480]  luck with that project though. Get your Brain Force Plus and Brain Force Ultra right now at
[05:54.480 --> 06:15.920]  infowarstore.com. Live from the info wars.com studios, you're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[06:15.920 --> 06:28.720]  And now your host, Owen Troyer.
[06:28.720 --> 06:35.600]  I want to be clear here on this Tuesday, January 31st, 2023, as I'm about to cover all of the news
[06:35.600 --> 06:45.040]  that ties the Bidens to biological weapons research that ties the Bidens to really,
[06:45.760 --> 06:51.200]  at this point, you're looking at the Bidens as maybe even being the cause for this war in Ukraine
[06:52.000 --> 06:57.360]  with some of the information we have coming out and all the corruption and everything we have
[06:57.360 --> 07:02.560]  for you today. I want to be clear about something. I'm not trying to give you false hope and I'm not
[07:02.560 --> 07:08.400]  going to come on air here today and tell you that Joe Biden, Hunter Biden, the Biden crime family,
[07:08.400 --> 07:14.960]  Blinken and all their associates are going down. No, I'm not here to tell you that. I in fact have
[07:14.960 --> 07:19.760]  very little faith that that will happen, perhaps more faith than in times past when government
[07:19.760 --> 07:24.880]  corruption is being exposed. But I just want you to be clear here. I'm not trying to sell you false
[07:24.880 --> 07:32.400]  hope. But what I do believe is happening at this point is the dam is beginning to break, folks.
[07:32.400 --> 07:38.800]  The dam is beginning to break. You see a big dam with cracks in it, now water leaking out,
[07:38.800 --> 07:45.360]  you know that dam is coming down. And oh, that new crack that just sprung a leak over there,
[07:45.360 --> 07:49.520]  well, that might not be the one to bring it down, but oh, here's another crack forming over here.
[07:49.520 --> 07:53.280]  Here's another crack forming over here. Here's another crack forming over here. I mean, eventually
[07:53.280 --> 08:00.080]  that dam is going to break. This deep state globalist dam of corruption with the mainstream
[08:00.080 --> 08:06.720]  media and big tech covering up all the crimes that now we're so aware of, we just witness it in
[08:06.720 --> 08:14.880]  real time and call it out. Nothing gets done. The dam is breaking. And really at this point,
[08:15.760 --> 08:22.400]  the deep state, the globalists have two options. And that's either start this war with Russia and
[08:22.400 --> 08:27.440]  really have it pop off so bad that it distracts from everything and takes all the air out of the room,
[08:28.720 --> 08:37.040]  or they try to turn Biden into some sort of a patchwork to patch up all the leaks in the dam.
[08:37.040 --> 08:42.160]  And they actually burn Biden and you actually do get the Biden crime family to have some arrests.
[08:42.720 --> 08:48.160]  It'll be like the Jeffrey Epstein industrial level sex trafficking situation where you'll get one or
[08:48.160 --> 08:52.800]  two arrests, maybe three, they'll get a nice easy prison sentence, they'll get a nice house arrest,
[08:53.520 --> 08:57.040]  and then magically the, you know, the lead guy will die or something in jail.
[08:59.120 --> 09:04.960]  But that's, it's beginning to reach a point of no return here. And there's enough genuine interest
[09:05.520 --> 09:11.040]  from the Republicans in Congress, specifically on the House side, that I don't see how this goes down
[09:11.040 --> 09:17.760]  without at least FBI agents going and getting arrested. Now they might not sell Biden out,
[09:18.800 --> 09:23.760]  but they all know what's going on. And except Biden apparently, he doesn't even know he's being
[09:23.760 --> 09:27.520]  investigated. Biden was asked about it. He said, Oh, I didn't know I was being investigated.
[09:28.560 --> 09:37.520]  Oh, interesting. Do you know what day it is, sir? Do you know your address? Have you ever had a
[09:37.520 --> 09:40.800]  situation where you've had a friend get knocked out unconscious and you kind of got to get up over
[09:40.800 --> 09:45.280]  him and you know, how many fingers am I holding up? What day is it? What's your name? You kind of
[09:45.280 --> 09:48.960]  got to get him back into, get him back into consciousness. That's Joe Biden walking around
[09:48.960 --> 09:55.040]  on a normal day. Hey, Joe, what's your name? What time is it? Where are you? I'm a corn pop.
[09:56.480 --> 10:03.040]  I was a black lifeguard in a pool. My butt's been wiped. Joe, did you know you're under
[10:03.040 --> 10:11.120]  investigation? No, I didn't know. No, I didn't know that. So let me start on the lighter end and
[10:11.120 --> 10:15.840]  we'll slowly get into the more serious stuff. And I've got to be really diligent with my time on
[10:15.840 --> 10:21.120]  this issue because we've got guests coming up today. We weren't able to get Marco Polo on.
[10:21.120 --> 10:25.520]  We all we issued a retraction and a correction of something I covered earlier this week from the
[10:25.520 --> 10:31.200]  Gateway Pundit. And they wanted to say, Hey, will you fix this? So I said, Hey, I'll not I'll
[10:31.200 --> 10:35.440]  retract it. But let's have you on. You can correct the record yourself. That's what we do here.
[10:37.920 --> 10:42.960]  We're not like the line crop media who lies, deceives, manipulates on purpose. And then after
[10:42.960 --> 10:46.160]  they lied to you about a vaccine for two years, it's killing people. They act like none of it
[10:46.160 --> 10:52.800]  ever happened. But I've got all this news on the vaccines and the latest with Pfizer and Project
[10:52.800 --> 10:57.440]  Veritas and more. Dr. Peter McCullough is going to be joining us. Unfortunately, can't be in studio.
[10:57.440 --> 11:02.240]  We've had some severe winter weather here, flights and travel getting canceled. So we can't be in
[11:02.240 --> 11:10.640]  studio, but he will be on with us for at least an hour. Now, Joe Biden today. We passed the American
[11:10.640 --> 11:17.040]  Rescue Plan without a single vote from Republicans in Congress. We gave states and local governments
[11:17.040 --> 11:21.120]  money to keep firefighters in the fire hall, first responders on the job, teachers in the
[11:21.120 --> 11:28.800]  classroom and nurses in the clinics and hospitals. So the American Rescue Plan. Now think about this.
[11:28.800 --> 11:34.160]  They've had to pass the Inflation Reduction Act when they say there's no inflation.
[11:35.920 --> 11:40.160]  And now they've passed the American Rescue Plan when they say this is the greatest economy
[11:40.160 --> 11:47.520]  ever under Joe Biden. Well, something doesn't add up there. Why would you have to pass the
[11:47.520 --> 11:51.440]  American Rescue Plan if it's the greatest economy under Joe Biden? Oh, because you lied. It's not
[11:51.440 --> 11:56.800]  a good economy. It's a horrible economy under Joe Biden. Gotcha. Why would you have to pass
[11:56.800 --> 12:01.200]  the Inflation Reduction Act if there is no inflation? Oh, that's right. It's record high
[12:01.200 --> 12:09.280]  inflation that Joe Biden caused and the Democrat policies. Gotcha. Do you see what lying low
[12:09.280 --> 12:14.640]  lives these Democrats are? There's no inflation, but we got to pass the Inflation Reduction Act
[12:14.640 --> 12:21.520]  to stop inflation. You said there was no inflation. This is the greatest economy ever, greatest economic
[12:21.520 --> 12:27.760]  recovery ever under Joe Biden. So we have to pass the American Rescue Plan. Rescue. You said it was
[12:27.760 --> 12:36.640]  the greatest economy ever. What do we need rescuing from? And then you've got the details of the
[12:36.640 --> 12:45.760]  American Rescue Plan, funding the drag queen sexy time for kids. Nice. Don't you love that? You drop
[12:45.760 --> 12:51.360]  little Johnny, you drop little Jill off at school and you see a 300 pound dude in walking in with
[12:51.360 --> 12:58.640]  a leotard, pubic hair bulging out of his crotch with a tiara on. You say, what is that? Oh, that's
[12:58.640 --> 13:03.440]  your new, that's your new guest speaker today, teaching little Johnny and little Jill how to use
[13:03.440 --> 13:13.440]  rainbow dildos. What is that? That's the American Rescue Plan. Thanks, Biden. Thank you. Joe Biden
[13:13.440 --> 13:18.640]  asked if he's going to be providing testimony to special counsel Robert, her investigating him.
[13:19.200 --> 13:23.440]  He's response. I don't even know about the special counsel. I don't even know I'm being
[13:23.440 --> 13:33.280]  investigated. What is going on here? Who am I? Where am I? What am I? Who are you? What? I'm
[13:33.280 --> 13:38.800]  being investigated. I've never heard of such a thing. So is Joe Biden really that inept
[13:40.000 --> 13:45.600]  cognitively or is he just lying pretending he has no idea that he's being invested for his crimes?
[13:45.600 --> 13:53.840]  Joe Biden repeats debunked story about Amtrak conductor. He just keeps lying about that. I mean,
[13:53.840 --> 13:59.840]  this guy just lies all day long. Soon he'll tell you he's from Philadelphia and, you know, played
[13:59.840 --> 14:04.160]  center for the Philadelphia Eagles and snapped the ball to Ron Jaworski. If they win the Superbowl,
[14:04.160 --> 14:08.400]  that'll be the next thing. I remember I was the center for the Eagles snapping the football to
[14:08.400 --> 14:16.000]  Ron Jaworski. Wow, Joe. But you just heard it in the opening segment. Oversight chair, James Comer,
[14:17.120 --> 14:21.520]  ready to investigate anyone in business with the Bidens. Anthony Blinken needs to be the first
[14:21.520 --> 14:29.680]  one called then. Or maybe we should extradite Anthony Blinken to Albania. Maybe we should extradite
[14:30.240 --> 14:37.680]  Anthony Blinken to Albania and see if they would like to have a word with him over the Soros
[14:37.680 --> 14:44.240]  commies that Biden and Blinken were trying to get into power in Albania and the narcotics traffickers
[14:44.240 --> 14:52.320]  that they were protecting as well. Yeah. Yeah. Now I'm going to come back and get to the more
[14:52.320 --> 14:58.800]  serious end of the Biden crime family and the situation in Ukraine. And it's just it's really
[14:58.800 --> 15:02.880]  bad folks. I mean, you're talking about these are the biggest criminals in the world legitimately.
[15:02.880 --> 15:10.640]  So that's going to be coming up now. I'm so loaded today. But I'm going to be needing
[15:10.640 --> 15:15.920]  to fund this operation with Alex out. He is returning tomorrow. But I'm so loaded today.

[19:09.040 --> 19:15.360]  heights of politics not just in America but the world. We are engaging the globalist at point-blank
[19:15.360 --> 19:21.600]  range in the information war but I don't deserve the credit. Yes I've persevered but the listeners
[19:21.600 --> 19:27.760]  and viewers who support NPR wars for the real reason you've had the success we're having now
[19:27.760 --> 19:33.680]  the greatest victories in the fight against the new order you've ever had we are now entering the
[19:33.680 --> 19:40.080]  final mile of the marathon and that's why today it's more important than ever to realize how
[19:40.080 --> 19:44.400]  important you've been in this fight and to continue and the efforts you've been tearing out and to
[19:44.400 --> 19:51.120]  intensify them. God bless you all I salute you I thank you and I beg you to intensify what you're
[19:51.120 --> 19:56.560]  doing now because we are over the target and this dream is happening. The fight is my fight it's
[19:56.560 --> 20:04.320]  your fight it's our fight God bless you all. Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the
[20:04.320 --> 20:27.920]  New World Order it's Alex Jones. All right a lot of information that individuals like D.C.
[20:27.920 --> 20:35.120]  Drano and War Clan Destine are doing the legwork on and I'm going to try to just briefly
[20:36.640 --> 20:45.600]  sort through this now but these are I mean these investigations lead to obvious questions and
[20:45.600 --> 20:49.280]  serious should lead to serious investigations but we know the deep state will do everything to
[20:49.280 --> 20:59.040]  protect its own and sadly right now there's so few good people within our government overall but
[20:59.040 --> 21:05.280]  specifically be it the FBI or Justice Department that our corrupt criminal politicians have been
[21:05.280 --> 21:10.000]  able to get away with so much for so long but that damn is breaking and the biden crime family
[21:10.000 --> 21:16.080]  might just be the ones to break it. Now the receipts are provided here by D.C. Drano.
[21:16.080 --> 21:22.640]  Now remember when the Pentagon confirmed the U.S partnered with 46 Ukrainian bioweapons labs
[21:23.200 --> 21:28.080]  this was on the Pentagon's website the fake news media told you it didn't exist but it was there
[21:28.080 --> 21:33.680]  we have the receipts and Hunter Biden secured millions for one of the labs Meadow biota.
[21:35.200 --> 21:41.840]  Well now we have a February 24th 2022 letter from Zelensky ordering the destruction of all
[21:41.840 --> 21:51.520]  government files for Meadow biota I'm sure it's nothing. Ah a little ice scratch your back you
[21:51.520 --> 22:00.720]  scratch mine a little what should we call it pay for play. I mean this is unbelievable the
[22:00.720 --> 22:06.960]  Biden family has been doing so much criminal activity in Ukraine since Biden was a senator
[22:06.960 --> 22:12.400]  through his time as vice president with the speech at the council on foreign relations bragging about
[22:12.400 --> 22:20.640]  his bribery and now to the Zelensky years where I guess it's Zelensky covering up the Biden dirt
[22:22.000 --> 22:28.640]  Zelensky helped covering up the Biden bioweapons labs and what does Zelensky get well he basically
[22:28.640 --> 22:35.760]  now can get whatever money and weapons he wants from Joe Biden for whatever reason
[22:35.760 --> 22:43.040]  and and maybe there's a little mutual benefit there Biden gets to start a war with Russia
[22:43.040 --> 22:50.400]  to distract from his crimes and Zelensky gets billions of dollars Ukraine asks as a criminal
[22:50.400 --> 22:56.400]  proxy state for the western deep state interest of the Biden crime family and other US politicians
[22:56.400 --> 23:06.240]  and Zelensky just sits there enriching himself beyond our wildest imaginations
[23:07.200 --> 23:13.040]  so that is an ongoing story hunter Biden helps secure millions in funding for military biotech
[23:13.040 --> 23:19.520]  research program in Ukraine this was from March of last year all the data is there all the
[23:19.520 --> 23:26.560]  information is public the receipts the government documents and now we know Zelensky requested
[23:26.560 --> 23:35.840]  the destruction of all those files why did Zelensky do that and why was this happening
[23:36.400 --> 23:45.760]  right at the same time when the war started to heat up I doubt that's a coincidence and there's
[23:45.760 --> 23:50.480]  other threads out there like this one on the screen from blue canaries meadow meadow biota thread
[23:51.360 --> 23:57.600]  produces bioagents under diplomatic cover as secret labs then sells pandemic insurance and
[23:57.600 --> 24:03.280]  trackers to help countries get ahead of what they are putting out company part of Pentagon's
[24:03.280 --> 24:10.800]  DRTA program as well as funded by Rosemont Seneca that's hunter Biden it's all there
[24:10.800 --> 24:16.960]  there so what was really going on well joe biden has been acting illegally as a foreign agent
[24:16.960 --> 24:24.800]  for perhaps his entire career as a politician never filed a fair application and neither
[24:24.800 --> 24:33.120]  has his bag man his rat hole hunter biden hunter biden's laptop emails reveal another crime
[24:33.120 --> 24:39.120]  never filed a fair application yet hunter acted as foreign agent email shows he discussed breaking
[24:39.120 --> 24:45.520]  far outlaws of course they went after Mike Flynn as hard as they possibly could general Mike Flynn
[24:45.520 --> 24:49.120]  as hard as they possibly could claiming he was the foreign agent that didn't file their
[24:49.120 --> 24:53.280]  application that was all a lie the truth is it was hunter biden who was acting as a foreign
[24:53.280 --> 25:00.720]  agent who never filed the application because why would he he's acting illegally he wouldn't
[25:00.720 --> 25:06.720]  want to know about that and by the way if you really want to know what type of a low life
[25:06.720 --> 25:16.000]  scumbag hunter biden truly is and you know look when i think about the laptop story
[25:16.000 --> 25:20.320]  and hunter leaving his laptop at a repair place a lot of people say maybe this is hunter biden
[25:20.320 --> 25:25.440]  trying to get the news out maybe this is hunter biden begging for help you know maybe that's the
[25:25.440 --> 25:29.360]  case but you see stuff like this and and can i really blame something like this on joe biden
[25:29.360 --> 25:35.520]  maybe maybe joe biden maybe somebody else is telling hunter biden to be like this hunter biden
[25:35.520 --> 25:39.840]  goes to court against his four-year-old daughter to ban her from using his last name
[25:43.440 --> 25:49.760]  this is the daughter of hunter biden that he is completely disowned this is the daughter of hunter
[25:49.760 --> 25:56.400]  biden that he pretends doesn't exist she does this is the daughter of hunter biden that was born
[25:56.400 --> 26:06.800]  after he impregnated a stripper he refuses to pay child care he refuses to recognize her
[26:07.520 --> 26:09.840]  she doesn't get invited to any family affairs
[26:12.480 --> 26:16.960]  and by the way the whole relationship that hunter biden has now he was basically told to do that
[26:17.680 --> 26:22.320]  he said hey you want to distract from this this baby that you just had with this stripper you
[26:22.320 --> 26:31.920]  better get a new wife and kid fast and so he did but now this little girl is in court and the mother
[26:31.920 --> 26:43.600]  of this little girl london alexis roberts is in court because hunter biden wants to make sure
[26:43.600 --> 26:52.400]  that the daughter navy jone can never use the name biden oh and uh let's not forget that uh the
[26:52.400 --> 27:00.240]  stripper was also being paid by the bides so biden hired a stripper i guess it was his nice personal
[27:00.240 --> 27:07.040]  prostitute accidentally impregnates her i guess accidentally i guess we don't know that and then
[27:07.040 --> 27:13.680]  says you're fired and you're never allowed to see me again and you're and my daughter is never
[27:13.680 --> 27:19.760]  allowed to use my last name and i'm not paying a dime of child support and the liberal media says
[27:20.640 --> 27:29.440]  nothing nothing so talk about a lowlife hires a stripper to work for him gets her pregnant
[27:30.160 --> 27:36.160]  and then completely disowns her and says my daughter is never allowed to use my name and i'm
[27:36.160 --> 27:46.240]  not paying any child support and gets away with all of it so far so far now there's more on this
[27:47.200 --> 27:54.080]  and i've kind of been touching on this throughout the last couple of weeks how biden and obama
[27:54.080 --> 28:01.680]  really did not see eye to eye on the situation in ukraine and maybe that has something to do with obama's
[28:01.680 --> 28:09.600]  relations or feelings towards iran which we have a better idea about how they're getting involved
[28:09.600 --> 28:16.240]  in this whole picture now so i'll explain all that coming up but coming up in the next segment
[28:17.280 --> 28:21.680]  i covered a story from the gateway punnett the other day about hunter biden emails being edited
[28:21.680 --> 28:26.960]  by a group marco polo i retracted that coverage i've also since spoken to marco polo's people
[28:26.960 --> 28:31.440]  and the gateway punnett we've changed the story but i said hey look i'll retract it but why
[28:31.440 --> 28:36.480]  don't you come on come on air and talk about it as well and so that is the case now so uh
[28:37.120 --> 28:44.080]  we have somebody from marco polo joining us to talk about this story and they just want
[28:44.080 --> 28:51.680]  to set the record straight that they were not editing any of the biden emails with names like
[28:51.680 --> 28:56.800]  devin archer in them yeah mainstream media won't be covering this i'm sure

[33:19.680 --> 33:25.520]  your host olyn shroyer
[33:27.680 --> 33:31.920]  ladies and gentlemen there's one thing i'm proud to have that the mainstream media doesn't have
[33:31.920 --> 33:37.440]  and that's integrity and so if you've been listening to me for years you've probably heard maybe
[33:38.000 --> 33:42.480]  i've been on air here at info wars seven years and i think maybe four times over the years i've
[33:42.480 --> 33:47.600]  issued a retraction on the air and there've been a couple of times where i might miss speak something
[33:47.600 --> 33:51.120]  or give a wrong name or a wrong date and the crew will get in my ear and correct me and we'll correct
[33:51.120 --> 33:56.160]  the record on the air not like the mainstream media that lies to you consciously and will never
[33:56.160 --> 34:01.600]  admit to it never apologize for it never retract the story it's been done to me numerous times so
[34:01.600 --> 34:08.640]  the other day i was covering a gateway pundit story about marco polo allegedly doctoring some
[34:08.640 --> 34:13.120]  emails that they had published marco polo reached out and said that's not the case please retract the
[34:13.120 --> 34:19.120]  story and i'll also have you know i don't know if my guest garret zeigler has spoken to the gateway
[34:19.120 --> 34:23.360]  pundit but i did speak to them and said hey just so you know i talked to these people i
[34:23.360 --> 34:28.080]  retracted they've now changed their story as well this is what people that have integrity in media
[34:28.080 --> 34:32.720]  do that's why you never see it in the mainstream news so i said hey not only will i offer a retraction
[34:32.720 --> 34:37.520]  why don't you come on air and correct the record for yourself so garret zeigler founder of marco
[34:37.520 --> 34:42.960]  polo is with us and i know you sent me an email explaining the phenomenon that happened in the
[34:42.960 --> 34:47.520]  emails but why don't you just take the time right now to explain this to the people but but also
[34:47.520 --> 34:53.360]  just to make sure that people understand this none of this it's all real and that's the real story
[34:53.360 --> 34:59.040]  that goes on here well thank you oh and i appreciate it and speaks volumes about your character i
[34:59.040 --> 35:03.760]  didn't realize that we had a sort of a shared background i'm from outside st louis on the
[35:03.760 --> 35:09.040]  illinois side so when i was doing research yesterday i'm we come from the same you know
[35:09.040 --> 35:15.280]  sort of melu and so i appreciate the opportunity to go over this the bottom line up front is that
[35:15.280 --> 35:20.720]  we were bum rushed by this story by the gateway pundit and if they had reached out to us before
[35:20.720 --> 35:27.360]  the article ran we would have kindly and quickly told them that it dealt with the time zone that
[35:27.360 --> 35:35.680]  your mac is in when you view an email in the in the apple mail application um their original piece
[35:35.680 --> 35:42.000]  before they edited it made mention that the quickest way to find out if anything is doctored
[35:42.720 --> 35:48.960]  is if you go to the email metadata i.e the header and look at the message id in the one
[35:48.960 --> 35:53.760]  sheet that i sent over earlier in which we've released on our telegram channel clearly shows
[35:53.760 --> 36:01.360]  that the message id is the same and so sort of the example i use oan is if somebody's committing
[36:01.360 --> 36:07.520]  wire fraud and let's say there are two employees at a bank one's in new york and one's in chicago
[36:07.520 --> 36:13.840]  just because their email client shows a one hour difference because of the time zones
[36:13.840 --> 36:21.520]  doesn't mean that the email is any less permissible in a court of law and so it's it's that coupled
[36:21.520 --> 36:27.840]  with the fact that they cast dispersions on our entire dossier because of this misunderstanding
[36:27.840 --> 36:36.880]  i.e joe hoft wrote that because they didn't understand time zones issues our 630 plus page report
[36:38.400 --> 36:44.240]  is somehow you know deficient and it's not that we're above mistakes and that's why i'm
[36:44.240 --> 36:49.360]  honored to be on your show and i'm grateful you had me on i sincerely mean that because if this
[36:49.360 --> 36:56.400]  were a you know a legitimate air we would hop on it but it's sort of the worst of both worlds
[36:56.400 --> 37:05.920]  in that this is a very basic it forensic mistake that i think it's so basic oan that xr vision
[37:05.920 --> 37:12.640]  must have done this on purpose because if he is is really as you know as smart as he holds himself
[37:12.640 --> 37:18.560]  out to be then he wouldn't have made this mistake and so the only conclusion we're left with is that
[37:18.560 --> 37:24.720]  they did this on purpose expecting people to not clearly read the article and we're well aware
[37:24.720 --> 37:30.960]  that you didn't write it and it's on them to contact us beforehand and we have contacted them
[37:30.960 --> 37:37.120]  in fact a friend of a friend is a reporter there and we've privately asked them to take the story
[37:37.120 --> 37:46.400]  down but they refuse hopefully that's a three minute coherent articulate it's not a sexy issue
[37:46.960 --> 37:51.520]  but i just want people to know that you know we put a year into this dossier we established a
[37:51.520 --> 38:00.560]  separate 501c3 for it and we're very proud of the sort of intra group arguing we went over to
[38:00.560 --> 38:06.160]  to make sure every single page of this is rock solid and i don't want people to think that we're
[38:06.160 --> 38:12.800]  doctrine anything because like you said it's an incredible story it's all real and it's all about
[38:12.800 --> 38:19.120]  joe this email that they're alluding to this 22 point plan that was probably although not for
[38:19.120 --> 38:25.280]  sure based on classified documents implicates joe directly that means joey was feeding the intel
[38:25.280 --> 38:32.240]  to hunter who was then feeding it to devon archer it's multiple felonies and we list that in our
[38:32.240 --> 38:39.520]  report and so because i'm not petty i don't if gateway pundit will just take down the piece
[38:40.480 --> 38:46.880]  we're not we don't want to fight this out in court that's ridiculous but we do want them to get it
[38:46.880 --> 38:51.920]  right well and i know this might not seem a sexy issue to the audience but here's why i think
[38:51.920 --> 38:57.040]  it's important and why i invited you on and just two so people can kind of get an idea of the
[38:57.040 --> 39:01.520]  difference between what we do here at info wars and what the others in the mainstream media don't
[39:01.520 --> 39:07.200]  do and and and to kind of go off on a bit of a jag and i'll come back real quickly i would much
[39:07.200 --> 39:12.000]  rather have a situation where if i make a mistake on air somebody says hey you made a mistake offer
[39:12.000 --> 39:17.840]  a retraction instead of suing me for a trillion dollars but let's get back on to the subject
[39:17.840 --> 39:22.080]  material here's why i think this issue is sexy because i know what it's like to put work into
[39:22.080 --> 39:26.560]  something that you hold near and dear to your heart and then see someone tremendously myths
[39:26.560 --> 39:30.240]  represent that work it's been done to me a dozen times so when i made the mistake i said i don't
[39:30.240 --> 39:34.560]  want to be that guy and that's why i hesitate to jump on some narratives before i know the full
[39:34.560 --> 39:40.800]  facts even though the audience doesn't like it but here's the real sexiness you did put in the work
[39:40.800 --> 39:46.080]  you did put in the emails you did put out the report and i think it's kind of sad actually
[39:46.720 --> 39:51.040]  that i mean maybe it's a blessing in disguise that somebody has to make a mistake for this
[39:51.040 --> 39:54.960]  to get more traction and so i look at it this now is hey you know what this has more traction
[39:54.960 --> 39:58.800]  why don't you talk about the story you put hours of your life and others put hours of their life
[39:58.800 --> 40:06.480]  into reporting on well i think that it is sad that they haven't talked about the dossier until now
[40:06.480 --> 40:13.920]  now and again when we heard about this report by the gateway punnett the first thing we did was
[40:13.920 --> 40:18.800]  first of all act like adult men and reach out to them directly just like i called a producer at
[40:18.800 --> 40:25.520]  info wars it wasn't we're not trying to do what they did to us in in bum rush them but we're left
[40:25.520 --> 40:34.080]  to publicly dispute this now going back to your point directly this was a labor of love and again
[40:34.080 --> 40:42.160]  then we're very conservative in our accusations we logged at the very least 459 violations of
[40:42.160 --> 40:48.960]  state and federal laws and regulations what do i mean by that there are about 15 to 20 different
[40:48.960 --> 40:55.280]  statutes at the state and federal levels and regulations that hunter and associates violated
[40:55.280 --> 41:01.920]  but they violated those 15 to 20 state and federal laws and regs hundreds of times and so
[41:01.920 --> 41:08.240]  those run the gamut oh and their money laundering foreign agent registration act prostitution human
[41:08.240 --> 41:16.080]  trafficking three confirmed cases that um lobbying violations and so many other things and what
[41:16.080 --> 41:23.600]  separates us is we go into in fact that exact email that was the subject of their piece i'm going
[41:23.600 --> 41:31.600]  through this very quickly um trying to find it but basically that exact email was in our dossier
[41:31.600 --> 41:42.720]  it's on page 143 and that email alone based upon uh clear uh case law and reading of the statute is
[41:42.720 --> 41:50.880]  a violation of 22 usc 612 and to demystify that that's the foreign agent registration act statute
[41:50.880 --> 41:58.000]  that's exactly what they prosecuted paul maniford for and so in a true elinsky fashion they did
[41:58.000 --> 42:02.720]  exactly what they accuse their enemies of and so because devon archer was involved with this
[42:02.720 --> 42:10.320]  that's also a violation of 18 usc 2 which is the conspiracy statute and so in this scenario we cite
[42:10.320 --> 42:17.680]  the date april 12 2014 the district of columbia uh which is where hunter was when he committed the
[42:17.680 --> 42:24.800]  felony the accomplice and then the statute and anybody can go read this for free bidencrimes.info
[42:24.800 --> 42:31.520]  we have a couple of of urls we bought here's hunter.com or just at marcopolousa.org it's all

[42:38.720 --> 42:43.840]  strikes a relationship between marcopolo and oan that we can talk about our work going forward
[42:43.840 --> 42:48.000]  well i'd love to do that in fact i've got 10 seconds left to the segment if you can stick
[42:48.000 --> 42:51.680]  around and do another segment to get more into this i'd love to drill deeper into this
[42:51.680 --> 42:56.000]  because the issues are really coming to the fore now and you guys kind of did the background

[47:16.960 --> 47:22.960]  we have the founder of marco polo on with us garret zeigler marco polo usa dot organ if he'd
[47:22.960 --> 47:29.600]  like to lay out all those other urls before he's off here for you to go read their research
[47:29.600 --> 47:34.640]  where ladies and gentlemen they've done the deep deep dive into the hunter buying emails
[47:34.640 --> 47:42.160]  with emails and receipts from names such as devan archer and as he was cataloging in the last
[47:42.160 --> 47:49.520]  segment all the different criminal activity that is occurring in these emails and so i'd like to
[47:49.520 --> 47:54.640]  garret kind of give you the segment here with a question to pick up and run with and i'll start
[47:54.640 --> 48:01.280]  it like this has any one from law enforcement any form or function of law enforcement reached out to
[48:01.280 --> 48:07.680]  you to either collaborate with you on your research or just asked you for maybe materials
[48:07.680 --> 48:16.080]  for their own research has that happened at all first of all yes i think i uh there's something
[48:16.080 --> 48:22.800]  wrong with my my mic i can't hear you very well but number one state level law enforcement um
[48:22.800 --> 48:27.760]  non federal and their conservatives they have reached out to us and i've actually had multiple
[48:27.760 --> 48:33.520]  conversations with them i won't go into which state but suffice it is to say that it's an ag
[48:33.520 --> 48:40.240]  office um somebody who we know very well uh he actually wrote an op-ed about the biden laptop
[48:40.240 --> 48:47.200]  in early 2022 um and you know so we've been working with them we have no if somebody read this report
[48:47.200 --> 48:52.000]  they would realize we have no illusions that hunter is going to face justice at the federal level his
[48:52.000 --> 48:57.360]  daddy will pardon him even if it's the last thing he does but there are numerous opportunities at the
[48:57.360 --> 49:02.800]  state level for attorneys general and other people within the statute of limitations to bring money
[49:02.800 --> 49:06.720]  laundering charges the only thing stopping them is their own courage sorry i'm going to hook up
[49:06.720 --> 49:16.240]  another mic here garret zeigler with us from marco polo usa he's just having a tech error there so
[49:16.240 --> 49:21.520]  he's going to get himself a new mic it looks like he's plugging that in right now and i do agree with
[49:21.520 --> 49:25.680]  his analysis and that's why i open the show like that saying i'm not trying to sell you hope you're
[49:25.680 --> 49:32.400]  here we're selling reality but the reality is that the biden crime family is being exposed and if
[49:32.400 --> 49:36.000]  there is any level of interest in this it looks like it might be at the state level as garret
[49:36.000 --> 49:40.400]  was just getting into garret it looks like your back connected is everything better sorry about
[49:40.400 --> 49:46.400]  that i had a bluetooth microphone that went haywire i'm on a wired one now so yeah i was just making
[49:46.400 --> 49:53.760]  the point that you know there's a there's an author based at the new york post her name's marina
[49:53.760 --> 49:59.760]  divine she wrote a book called laptop from hell came out in november of 2021 it was a great book
[49:59.760 --> 50:04.640]  he's a much better writer than i am and she's had a lot more experience and we love her book and we
[50:04.640 --> 50:10.240]  used it for this dossier she came out with a one page review on october 27th about her report you
[50:10.240 --> 50:17.440]  uh made the very good point that our dossier has not received the national attention that other
[50:17.440 --> 50:24.480]  people have gotten um part of that is i just don't do a ton of media but but miranda um who
[50:24.480 --> 50:30.720]  we collaborate with recognizes how sort of uh comprehensive this thing is and i urge everybody
[50:30.720 --> 50:35.840]  to go on our website marcopoleusa.org and read all of the reviews that have been written so far
[50:35.840 --> 50:42.240]  about the dossier and so you know what separates us is sort of the granularity we have never
[50:42.240 --> 50:47.120]  promised to be the first honest to worry although there is a story today in the daily mail i'm not
[50:47.120 --> 50:52.160]  sure we can pull it up the next seven minutes that is based on our suspicious activity reports we
[50:52.160 --> 50:56.800]  were actually given uh you know those those suspicious activity reports are submitted to the
[50:56.800 --> 51:01.920]  us treasure department from us banks and we were approached by a whistleblower who had access to
[51:01.920 --> 51:09.840]  the SARS that detail money laundering uh sex trafficking and other state and federal felonies
[51:09.840 --> 51:15.120]  that hunter uh in the biden family were involved in and the daily mail ran a piece this morning
[51:15.120 --> 51:21.520]  about our SARS and how one of the women that was employed by hunter was listed on a SAR and we've
[51:22.640 --> 51:27.280]  that's another just incredible piece in the daily mail about how we got under the skin of
[51:27.280 --> 51:35.760]  hunter's attorney kevin morris and um i mean this is crazy stuff well and like you said it's odd how
[51:35.760 --> 51:39.120]  you put this great workout and you're wondering if or when it's ever going to get the national
[51:39.120 --> 51:44.560]  attention sometimes it does take years for this stuff to catch up and like i said i mean i'm looking
[51:44.560 --> 51:47.680]  at this situation it's kind of like a little blessing in the sky is a silver lining i've got
[51:47.680 --> 51:52.880]  direct communication with you by the way i love you i love marcopolo i love the hoax i love gateway
[51:52.880 --> 51:56.160]  punnett i hope that you guys could actually collaborate and maybe make a bigger thing of
[51:56.160 --> 52:01.440]  this story when uh some of this some of this dust settles uh with the situation now because
[52:02.160 --> 52:06.560]  i guess i would ask it to you like this with all the new information and focus and attention
[52:06.560 --> 52:11.600]  to the biden crime family really post midterm elections when you're watching this and seeing
[52:11.600 --> 52:15.440]  this what what comes to your head or what do you want to shout at the tv screen or what do you
[52:15.440 --> 52:21.280]  wish the republicans in congress investigating this could could know and understand well thanks
[52:21.280 --> 52:26.640]  for being a god i did get an audience with both the senate investigators and the house investigators
[52:26.640 --> 52:31.360]  two weeks after they gained the majority and oh and i'm sure you and i would agree
[52:31.360 --> 52:35.200]  that our elections have many problems but let's just pause it for a moment that we did actually
[52:35.200 --> 52:40.160]  get the majority and we do have somewhat a modicum of free and fair elections but regardless
[52:40.160 --> 52:46.880]  we told them exactly what we you know laid out in our report that hunter doesn't have
[52:46.880 --> 52:54.000]  have uh the highest iq ever he's not the sharpest tool in the shed and what this means is there
[52:54.000 --> 53:00.400]  are many people out there from his executive assistants to partners to colleagues that know
[53:00.400 --> 53:04.880]  where the bodies are buried and so if they're expecting the congressional investigators
[53:04.880 --> 53:10.800]  to get answers from any part of the biden family that is spilt milk under the bridge they're not
[53:10.800 --> 53:15.520]  going to talk even if you subpoena them so what you need to do is go around to all these executive
[53:15.520 --> 53:21.920]  assistants katie dodge joanne myer eric schwerin all these names that we list in our dossier
[53:21.920 --> 53:28.160]  and one of them will crack because the purse i mean all these people are driven by self-interest
[53:28.160 --> 53:32.160]  and none of them are particularly virtuous and they don't have fruits of the spirit and so if
[53:32.160 --> 53:38.160]  you question them and go at them with intelligent documentation and know that you're not just you
[53:38.160 --> 53:44.160]  know shooting from the hip um they're going to answer your questions and produce that documentation
[53:44.160 --> 53:48.800]  so what i told to the senate and house directly and what i said on this phone call with the state
[53:48.800 --> 53:57.120]  ag's offices i was alluding to is ask for the documentation and ask the people that they're
[53:57.120 --> 54:01.840]  not expecting they're expecting kevin morris to get subpoenas they're expecting hunter's portly
[54:01.840 --> 54:09.120]  little xenophilic art dealer george burges to get questioned if joanne myer gets a wide ranging
[54:09.120 --> 54:13.120]  subpoena for all the documentation really and we have her on multiple federal felonies money
[54:13.120 --> 54:18.000]  laundering etc she has a much greater interest in telling the truth and she doesn't have the
[54:18.000 --> 54:24.400]  resources from a legal perspective to fight back against them and i was pursued by the january
[54:24.400 --> 54:28.960]  sixth scam committee i know how congressional committees work although this one is a standing
[54:28.960 --> 54:33.600]  committee where that committee was a freaking joke and it was staffed by you know not even
[54:33.600 --> 54:39.920]  republicans that were approved by the majority leader but you do have to produce documentation
[54:39.920 --> 54:45.760]  even if you plead the fifth like i did i wasn't i respect them so little i respect benny tomson
[54:45.760 --> 54:51.200]  so little that i wasn't going to give him the the opportunity you know to ask me questions and his
[54:51.200 --> 54:56.240]  committee to ask me questions it was a farce but i did have to turn over communications and so
[54:56.240 --> 55:00.720]  even if these people you asked me what i'm trying to get across is even if these people don't talk
[55:00.720 --> 55:06.960]  to the committees themselves they'll have valuable documentation and again hunter is only relevant
[55:06.960 --> 55:14.400]  as it connects to joe and so the first things i would go for were would be asking uh you know
[55:14.400 --> 55:21.360]  maybe naomi biden hunter's daughter who he texted that he was forced to give joe half a salary
[55:21.360 --> 55:26.560]  for 30 years that's a direct quote from hunter that's not me in my home office making this crap up
[55:26.560 --> 55:32.400]  so i would you know they're probably not expecting naomi biden to get subpoenaed but she's a party
[55:32.400 --> 55:37.120]  to this she's she's on the text messages and emails that would be one of the people do things
[55:37.120 --> 55:42.400]  that are creative that the left hasn't worked aimed now do i expect the republicans to do this
[55:44.320 --> 55:49.840]  probably not because a lot of them do not have the creative that's another great story
[55:51.360 --> 55:57.600]  that hunter basically i'm looking at screen a hunter basically paid for and this is absolutely
[55:57.600 --> 56:02.720]  verifiable we have the phone number in our report hunter's firm rosemont sinica which was
[56:02.720 --> 56:09.280]  funded in part by full and or by foreign oligarchs paid for a private iphone for joe biden for the
[56:09.280 --> 56:14.000]  entirety of his vice presidency what does this mean the secret service in the white house communications
[56:14.000 --> 56:19.040]  agency because i was in the trump white house i know these things they have a hardened cell phone
[56:19.040 --> 56:26.320]  for both the vp and potis meaning it's much more secure this is why obama had blackberries
[56:26.320 --> 56:32.880]  they're much it's much much harder to hack into but joey had a private iphone on the side paid
[56:32.880 --> 56:37.040]  for by son's business and that was a way for hunter to always get in touch with his daddy so
[56:37.040 --> 56:42.560]  it's not a burner phone is what it's called joe ab yes and we actually put the phone number it's
[56:42.560 --> 56:47.120]  not it's not live anymore but we put the phone number in our report to tell congressional
[56:47.120 --> 56:51.920]  investigators hey if there is one line that you need to subpoena the records for it's this
[56:51.920 --> 56:57.920]  because even if we don't have the audios oh and we'll know uh when and and for how long joey and
[56:57.920 --> 57:03.360]  hunter talked and that's where all the conversations about victor's choking the imf loan everything
[57:03.360 --> 57:09.520]  else that's where those records will be joey it was born in 1942 he's 80 years old he's not going
[57:09.520 --> 57:13.760]  to put this in writing like his stupid son did he's going to do this over the phone and so they
[57:13.760 --> 57:19.200]  need to subpoena those records AT&T will have them if they don't we'll know that there's they're
[57:19.200 --> 57:23.760]  basically a politicized company because they gave over the records for mark meadow so i personally
[57:23.760 --> 57:28.240]  don't care for a whole lot but nevertheless his freaking AT&T records got subpoenaed if they can
[57:28.240 --> 57:31.920]  do that to us we should be able to get it for joey's burner phone and not to mention everything
[57:31.920 --> 57:35.760]  that was subpoenaed as part of the january 6th investigations people's personal information
[57:35.760 --> 57:40.000]  uh garret if you can do five more minutes we got a short 90 second break if you can do five more
[57:40.000 --> 57:45.200]  minutes let's finish this out this is an incredible interview from marco polo founder garret zeagle
[57:45.200 --> 57:54.800]  marco marco polo usa.org i talk a lot about the great successes info wars has had i don't think
[57:54.800 --> 58:01.200]  anybody can deny it and it is because of listeners and viewers supporting us when we talk about the
[58:01.200 --> 58:07.120]  crew at info wars people behind the scenes the researchers the writers they really have been
[58:07.120 --> 58:12.320]  the mvps in this fight and we look at harrison smith and oh and shroyer and the hard work they
[58:12.320 --> 58:19.120]  engage in every day five six seven days a week it's really just incredible so for myself the whole

[01:00:04.160 --> 01:00:10.240]  great interview with garret zeigler of marco polo marco polo usa.org i do want him to share the
[01:00:10.240 --> 01:00:15.120]  other urls before he signs off with us because you know those those are the ones that people like
[01:00:15.120 --> 01:00:20.160]  to share and it's easier to remember and and and send people to if they want to read this quickly
[01:00:20.160 --> 01:00:26.560]  though my final questions for you and the time we have is there anything you saw in your dossier
[01:00:26.560 --> 01:00:33.440]  on the hunter biden emails which would lead more credence or or more smoke if you will to the
[01:00:33.440 --> 01:00:41.360]  biden involvement in ukraine and everything that we're seeing now there is one email in particular
[01:00:41.360 --> 01:00:47.520]  that is a fara violation and what i mean by that is there was a consulting group um called fti
[01:00:47.520 --> 01:00:54.320]  consulting that was responding to media inquiries uh at the time of all of the shenanigans hunter
[01:00:54.320 --> 01:01:00.400]  serving on the border brisma etc and one of those questions had to do uh with a gentleman who you
[01:01:00.400 --> 01:01:08.080]  probably know of ihor kolomoisky kolomoisky uh until recently was a tri citizen of israel cyprus
[01:01:08.080 --> 01:01:14.640]  in ukraine and ihor kolomoisky uh is being personally and his companies are being sued in
[01:01:14.640 --> 01:01:19.840]  three different district courts right now for laundering proceeds from provot bank which
[01:01:19.840 --> 01:01:25.920]  he was the beneficial owner of and ihor kolomoisky is the center of a very very corrupt matrix and
[01:01:25.920 --> 01:01:32.000]  the reason why this ties to the bidens is this joey as we all know withheld a billion dollar loan
[01:01:32.000 --> 01:01:40.000]  guarantee uh from the imf he withheld he basically uh threatened us support of the imf loan guarantee
[01:01:40.000 --> 01:01:47.680]  on victor shokin getting fired now this is why this is incredible that money from the imf went in
[01:01:47.680 --> 01:01:55.120]  large part to provot bank to then uh give out to these businesses but what in actuality happened
[01:01:55.120 --> 01:02:01.680]  was ihor kolomoisky gave it to his cypria domiciled shell companies and kept the cash himself
[01:02:01.680 --> 01:02:06.880]  this is hugely illegal there's there's there's litigation going on in the Delaware chance
[01:02:06.880 --> 01:02:12.240]  to record about this right now billions of dollars was stolen and why this is incredible
[01:02:12.240 --> 01:02:18.800]  is ihor kolomoisky has a relationship with makulis lechevsky the quote unquote front man
[01:02:18.800 --> 01:02:26.320]  for barisma in fact in ukraine's lechevskis referred to as a mini gar and ihor kolomoisky is
[01:02:26.320 --> 01:02:32.800]  the oligarch and so what this means is that if kolomoisky was funding barisma and there's the
[01:02:32.800 --> 01:02:38.480]  ukraine report out there from the anti-corruption center in 2012 way before we got involved and
[01:02:38.480 --> 01:02:43.840]  way before the american people knew about the biden family in detail they were connecting the dots
[01:02:43.840 --> 01:02:50.480]  about this and so one question that only congress can explore because i don't have subpoenas is what
[01:02:50.480 --> 01:02:56.320]  connection ihor kolomoisky had because if he funded barisma oh and that means that american
[01:02:56.320 --> 01:03:01.840]  taxpayers would have funded hunter's board seat in part because here's the chain of money
[01:03:02.640 --> 01:03:10.640]  american taxpayers to the imf the imf to provot bank the provot bank to ihor kolomoisky shell
[01:03:10.640 --> 01:03:15.840]  companies which he beneficially owns and some of that money would have then funded barisma
[01:03:15.840 --> 01:03:20.800]  because there's a lot of shells domiciled in the british version islands behind barisma i.e.
[01:03:21.440 --> 01:03:26.400]  brossey the investment holdings limited and all of these other basically their companies that exist
[01:03:26.400 --> 01:03:31.680]  on paper that have registered agents in foreign countries and so ihor kolomoisky is very important
[01:03:31.680 --> 01:03:39.120]  and this is going on today and we touch on this in our dossier that joe banned him from the from
[01:03:39.120 --> 01:03:44.720]  the country in march of 2022 and we think that was to safe face because ihor kolomoisky never
[01:03:44.720 --> 01:03:49.040]  comes to the states anyways he just has his proxies here and so i think it's a way for joe to
[01:03:49.040 --> 01:03:53.840]  say hey look i'm willing to go after somebody who was tangentially connected to my son ergo
[01:03:53.840 --> 01:03:59.920]  i'm not corrupt but it was really a toothless move it was just posturing and so i would urge
[01:03:59.920 --> 01:04:06.240]  all your listeners to go look at ihor kolomoisky and see what connection he has to uh to mccolas
[01:04:06.240 --> 01:04:13.440]  lechevsky provot bank is a cesspool of human excrement that the bottom of which we haven't
[01:04:13.440 --> 01:04:18.400]  even found yet and remember joey brought up provot bank on the leaked call between him and
[01:04:18.400 --> 01:04:25.440]  poroshenko in december of 2016 right before right before djt was installed wow joey was thinking
[01:04:25.440 --> 01:04:30.480]  about provot bank and he told poroshenko hey nationalize provot bank quickly because if
[01:04:30.480 --> 01:04:36.400]  trump starts looking around he's gonna see all the stuff that's gone on wow amazing stuff now
[01:04:36.400 --> 01:04:42.080]  give out the convenient urls for people to send and share and go to thank you all in our twitter

[01:06:03.440 --> 01:06:19.360]  you found it the tip of the spear it is the alex joneshow with holland shawyer
[01:06:24.720 --> 01:06:30.400]  you know i'm trying not to be too reactionary to that last interview it's just i really feel good
[01:06:30.400 --> 01:06:35.280]  not just because the information that we were able to get out and now i think probably a good
[01:06:35.280 --> 01:06:42.000]  relationship forming but that you've made the right decision to tune in here knowing that we
[01:06:42.000 --> 01:06:49.040]  have the integrity and more importantly the desire to get things right and i don't put my ego or my
[01:06:49.040 --> 01:06:57.280]  pride above the information shared here because genuinely i got in media to inform people to
[01:06:57.280 --> 01:07:05.200]  empower people because i believe that's the path to improving our great country or working to restore
[01:07:05.200 --> 01:07:12.000]  it to its once great state which i mean even democrats have to admit it's not the case they
[01:07:12.000 --> 01:07:15.200]  sit here all day and act like oh it's so much better under our leadership and then complain
[01:07:15.200 --> 01:07:19.440]  how racist america is and how devastated the economy is and you know the old story
[01:07:21.760 --> 01:07:26.720]  but man you know it's just it's just amazing when people want to do good when people have a
[01:07:26.720 --> 01:07:34.640]  genuine desire to do good how even differences can be used to come together and do good and so
[01:07:36.560 --> 01:07:43.120]  it's that simple hey i i i misunderstood and misrepresented something on the air they reached
[01:07:43.120 --> 01:07:46.320]  out and i said hey this is not right can you retract i said hey i'll retract but why don't
[01:07:46.320 --> 01:07:52.160]  you come over and tell the story and correct the record for me ends up being a great interview
[01:07:52.160 --> 01:07:56.160]  ends up being a great segment it'll probably get a bunch of views on bandot video will probably
[01:07:56.160 --> 01:08:02.800]  write a story for info wars dot com and now the story will be even bigger and when people have
[01:08:02.800 --> 01:08:10.720]  good intent in their heart that's how this stuff should shake out not never ask for a retraction
[01:08:10.720 --> 01:08:15.680]  sue you for a trillion dollars and so much good could have been done and instead it turns into
[01:08:15.680 --> 01:08:22.720]  something bad but i digress from that you made the right decision to tune in here you made the
[01:08:22.720 --> 01:08:28.800]  right decision to trust info wars instead of the rest of the mainstream news media and we've been
[01:08:28.800 --> 01:08:32.480]  proven right time and time again not just with our news coverage like we're going to get into
[01:08:32.480 --> 01:08:38.000]  again with dr peter mccullough coming up here shortly and the vaccines but the integrity
[01:08:38.000 --> 01:08:43.920]  to get things right and if we do make a mistake to correct it and and even go over and above to
[01:08:43.920 --> 01:08:47.760]  make sure people see that not only do we want to correct it but we want you to know the truth
[01:08:47.760 --> 01:08:53.440]  so i'm not going to harp on that anymore but it really makes me feel good knowing that that
[01:08:53.440 --> 01:08:59.600]  we are on the right side and that we are the good guys in the media and it just today is just
[01:08:59.600 --> 01:09:04.560]  another reminder of that and so you know big ups to the crew big ups to the audience glad marco
[01:09:04.560 --> 01:09:10.080]  polo guy came on garret zeigler and shared with you his websites and stuff and now this story is
[01:09:10.080 --> 01:09:15.840]  going to get even more attention so it's funny god works that way sometimes and it ends up we
[01:09:15.840 --> 01:09:20.400]  kind of have a little bit of a similar background so putting that aside ladies and gentlemen
[01:09:21.440 --> 01:09:30.480]  it's important to keep info wars on the air now i i have the bone broth plus in my pantry because

[01:11:57.360 --> 01:12:03.520]  with obama and biden and ukraine uh but kind of in this middle little four minutes here let me
[01:12:03.520 --> 01:12:11.840]  just jump around and show you some of the other madness in fact let me let me do this because
[01:12:11.840 --> 01:12:15.600]  this video is going viral and i don't want to spend too much time on it but there's a point here
[01:12:15.600 --> 01:12:21.280]  that i think needs to be made and so there's a i don't even want to i don't even want to
[01:12:21.920 --> 01:12:26.480]  classify where this guy stands politically i mean you could say socialist i don't think he
[01:12:26.480 --> 01:12:29.920]  denied but i don't i don't even really think there's anything consistent there but
[01:12:29.920 --> 01:12:33.600]  he's gone on the young turks he's made a bunch of controversial statements it's on piker over the
[01:12:33.600 --> 01:12:42.080]  years um and so there's a video of a really popular youtuber named mr beast who's become wildly
[01:12:42.080 --> 01:12:49.520]  successful made millions of dollars and he decided to purchase surgery basically for a thousand people
[01:12:49.520 --> 01:12:55.440]  to have their blindness cured so this guy youtuber becomes massively famous successful
[01:12:55.440 --> 01:12:59.680]  and then pays for a thousand people to have a surgery so that they can see again
[01:12:59.680 --> 01:13:04.800]  that video goes viral hassan piker um formerly of the young turks i don't know if he still goes on
[01:13:04.800 --> 01:13:10.640]  there but big twitcher maybe the number one even earner on twitch um he makes millions of dollars
[01:13:10.640 --> 01:13:16.720]  on twitch but you know he's a good communist and so here was his response to seeing the video of
[01:13:16.720 --> 01:13:27.920]  people getting cured of their blindness and it's gone viral here it is
[01:13:27.920 --> 01:13:33.840]  you watched the video go oh how how cute and how nice i watched the video and i'm filled with rage
[01:13:34.560 --> 01:13:39.680]  that's like wrong with you that we shut off exactly access to a 10 minute procedure because
[01:13:39.680 --> 01:13:45.200]  we pay walled it and decided that like some people just simply can't get it it is so
[01:13:45.200 --> 01:13:51.840]  insanely frustrating that it like it's up to like one youtube guy to like decide to make
[01:13:51.840 --> 01:13:58.000]  content out of it that it like is it people who are too poor can't just see that's insane
[01:13:58.640 --> 01:14:04.080]  anyway sorry it's just like a deeply deeply frustrating concept now let me explain something
[01:14:04.080 --> 01:14:10.320]  here i understand where hassan is coming from because i've been there before when i was you know
[01:14:10.320 --> 01:14:14.480]  younger but i've had life experience and i've learned things now that's why they say if you're
[01:14:14.480 --> 01:14:17.840]  not 20 if you're not a liberal by the time you're 20 you don't have a heart if you're not a conservative
[01:14:17.840 --> 01:14:23.520]  by the time you're 30 you don't have a brain but i actually understand exactly where hassan piker is
[01:14:23.520 --> 01:14:30.880]  coming from i think the overall message is is received however the logic from hassan piker
[01:14:30.880 --> 01:14:37.200]  hasn't advanced to where it needs to be because he's missing two points entirely one which is the
[01:14:37.200 --> 01:14:41.680]  obvious one and i'm not giving hassan piker over this i'm just pointing this out hassan you make
[01:14:41.680 --> 01:14:47.120]  millions of dollars why don't you go buy a thousand people blindness surgery if you're so enraged
[01:14:47.120 --> 01:14:51.360]  because people can't get their blindness cured because they don't have the money well i know you
[01:14:51.360 --> 01:14:56.240]  have a lot of money your earnings on twitch have been made public you've you've shown off your
[01:14:56.240 --> 01:15:00.880]  beautiful car purchases online so i know you've got plenty money why don't you sell your portion
[01:15:00.880 --> 01:15:05.840]  pay for somebody's blindness surgery okay maybe then you won't be so enraged but i don't see that
[01:15:05.840 --> 01:15:09.360]  happening but that's fine i'm not blaming hassan piker for being a capitalist personally
[01:15:09.360 --> 01:15:16.160]  but see that's what it comes down to why is mr beast able to pay for a thousand people to
[01:15:16.160 --> 01:15:23.760]  have their blindness cured because of capitalism and so this is the big logical gap that people
[01:15:23.760 --> 01:15:28.880]  like hassan piker who i think genuinely wishes people could get their blindness cured maybe he
[01:15:28.880 --> 01:15:33.040]  doesn't want to pay for it but he wants someone else to pay for it but guess who did a guy who
[01:15:33.040 --> 01:15:39.600]  made millions of dollars in a free market capitalist society so once again it's capitalism
[01:15:39.600 --> 01:15:45.280]  and good people that win the government will never be the answer to our problems and it never
[01:15:45.280 --> 01:15:52.400]  should be but look at what free market capitalists have done like mr beast paying for people to see
[01:15:52.400 --> 01:16:06.880]  again to me that's a story of success of capitalism not the failures
[01:16:08.080 --> 01:16:14.240]  hey what's up bone hey mcbrane what's going on man i can see hey really like that work you did

[01:20:14.640 --> 01:20:20.080]  well i'm gonna tell you my response to that video got a serious conversation going here in studio
[01:20:20.080 --> 01:20:23.280]  and i don't want to spend too much time on it but a couple of points being made by the crew like
[01:20:24.000 --> 01:20:28.080]  hey you know these people are getting government benefits to the tune of tens of thousands of
[01:20:28.080 --> 01:20:32.000]  dollars why wouldn't the government just pay for them to have the surgery i think a fair point
[01:20:33.440 --> 01:20:38.560]  and another point was you know the government will give you $15,000 to go buy an electric car
[01:20:38.560 --> 01:20:42.080]  why won't they give $15,000 to cure somebody's blindness and get them in the workforce well
[01:20:42.080 --> 01:20:47.120]  because they're invested in green technologies they're invested in stocks and companies that
[01:20:47.120 --> 01:20:50.880]  build and produce electric cars and their batteries so they that benefits them they're
[01:20:50.880 --> 01:20:55.920]  basically giving money to themselves but my overall point which i think is even
[01:20:55.920 --> 01:21:04.720]  easier to solve this issue with hey if you want to give money to people to have surgeries to cure
[01:21:04.720 --> 01:21:12.960]  their blindness we probably shouldn't be spending 150 billion dollars in ukraine how many how many
[01:21:12.960 --> 01:21:18.320]  how many surgeries could we do to heal people's blindness with 150 billion dollars for war in
[01:21:18.320 --> 01:21:25.120]  ukraine see and it always comes back to that i'm not a socialist i don't like government funding
[01:21:25.120 --> 01:21:29.120]  anything but if i'm going to sit here and listen to people complaining about the government not
[01:21:29.120 --> 01:21:34.480]  funding stuff here in america well then please let's not spend 21 trillion dollars on wars in
[01:21:34.480 --> 01:21:39.520]  the middle east let's not go down that road again with this road with this war in ukraine already
[01:21:39.520 --> 01:21:44.960]  150 billion dollars not to mention but i guess this would be argued as humanitarian but we
[01:21:44.960 --> 01:21:48.560]  know that's not where the money goes the hundreds of billions of dollars that we spend on illegal
[01:21:48.560 --> 01:21:54.640]  immigrants that come in here and get stuff for free now i digress on that but it you know i
[01:21:54.640 --> 01:22:00.480]  think there's a fair conversation here and and even though i think hasan's logic in that video is
[01:22:00.480 --> 01:22:06.160]  is immature and missing the overall point ironically enough him sitting there with a million dollars
[01:22:07.360 --> 01:22:12.800]  and him sitting there actually mad at the victories of capitalism but nonetheless i think that the
[01:22:12.800 --> 01:22:17.040]  heart is in the right place and i think it resonates with a lot of people but i digress
[01:22:18.400 --> 01:22:23.520]  now we got peter mccullough coming up in the next segment and i've got so much of this vaccine news
[01:22:23.520 --> 01:22:29.440]  folks i mean it is two stacks of it today we're going to be getting into all of it with dr peter
[01:22:29.440 --> 01:22:36.240]  mccullough now quickly though trying to finish up the situation with obama and biden in ukraine
[01:22:36.960 --> 01:22:42.320]  and it was a week or two ago where i came out and did a report on my research realizing that
[01:22:42.320 --> 01:22:49.600]  obama and biden actually were were not cooperative on the situation in ukraine and now more is coming
[01:22:49.600 --> 01:22:56.080]  out about that clandestine has done his own deep dive into this now that i have everyone's attention
[01:22:56.080 --> 01:23:00.720]  allow me to address why us establishment politicians are sending tanks jets weapons equipment and a
[01:23:00.720 --> 01:23:04.880]  hundred billion dollars plus to ukraine it has nothing to do with ukraine citizens and everything
[01:23:04.880 --> 01:23:10.960]  to do with deep state assets and secrets in ukraine let's go back to when and where it all began
[01:23:10.960 --> 01:23:17.680]  2005 senator obama and senator lugar visited former soviet biological and chemical facilities in
[01:23:17.680 --> 01:23:24.320]  ukraine established by the u.s. deep state routes in ukraine to counter bio weapons and by the way
[01:23:24.320 --> 01:23:30.000]  he's got all the receipts shared in his tweet thread when speaking of the labs in 2005 here's how
[01:23:30.000 --> 01:23:36.720]  they were described by washington post the labs were part of a cold war network of anti plague
[01:23:36.720 --> 01:23:42.320]  stations that supplied highly lethal pathogens to soviet bio weapons factories so when russia
[01:23:42.320 --> 01:23:47.760]  does anti plague research it's bio weapons but what are they doing over there and finds her
[01:23:48.960 --> 01:23:55.280]  bio weapons but when the u.s. does defensive gain of function slash directed evolution research
[01:23:55.280 --> 01:24:03.040]  it's not bio weapons seems that their tune has changed and so it gets into all of this it's a
[01:24:03.040 --> 01:24:09.840]  long thread i'm not going to have the time but basically all of this stuff with obama and it
[01:24:09.840 --> 01:24:16.240]  and it does eventually tie into biden and the bio labs in ukraine it was well known and mainstream
[01:24:16.240 --> 01:24:22.480]  media news as of 2005 when both the republicans and the democrats were trying to get involved in
[01:24:22.480 --> 01:24:28.320]  ukraine and it was and it's been alleged with the dots connected by lee stranahan and other
[01:24:28.320 --> 01:24:33.840]  investigative reporters that this is how the deep state basically got obama involved in ukraine
[01:24:33.840 --> 01:24:40.480]  originally which perhaps he may now regret or or was never really in his best interest but it
[01:24:40.480 --> 01:24:48.560]  was all mainstream news washington post everybody had it oh but then in 2000 in 2001 in 2022 when
[01:24:48.560 --> 01:24:52.480]  the situation in ukraine started to develop and people started saying hey what about those bio
[01:24:52.480 --> 01:24:57.120]  weapons labs what about the bio weapons labs on the pentagon website did obama and others knew
[01:24:57.120 --> 01:25:03.120]  about all the sudden the mainstream news changed their tune and they said there are no labs the
[01:25:03.120 --> 01:25:08.880]  labs don't exist and they're not bio weapons labs even though they already reported on them years ago
[01:25:08.880 --> 01:25:15.360]  already reported how they existed and by their own definition were bio labs but but oh now that
[01:25:15.360 --> 01:25:20.640]  there's ooh the corruption coming to the front in the war now they don't want you to know about it
[01:25:22.240 --> 01:25:29.760]  clandestine follows it up they can't formulate a counter to my thread that has now done over
[01:25:29.760 --> 01:25:34.720]  three and a half million views in 16 hours their only counter is obama picture photoshopped they
[01:25:34.720 --> 01:25:42.720]  were published by newsweek in 2005 who has since deleted the article uh by the way a very interesting
[01:25:42.720 --> 01:25:47.040]  newsweek article we're going to be covering with peter mccullough today mm-hmm and stay tuned for
[01:25:47.040 --> 01:25:52.480]  that but the daily mail story is still out senator obama pushed to destroy massive arms ammo caches
[01:25:52.480 --> 01:25:57.120]  in ukraine so it was a back and forth i think obama knew he was getting into something wrong
[01:25:57.120 --> 01:26:04.640]  plus i think obama understood that his friends and allies and his uh relationship or or positive
[01:26:05.200 --> 01:26:12.880]  view of iran was going to become an issue in ukraine and now that's becoming more of an issue
[01:26:13.440 --> 01:26:19.920]  by the way so obama already destroyed all this stuff that was in ukraine and now biden
[01:26:19.920 --> 01:26:26.960]  is making us pay for more of it but so okay what's happening in the geopolitical picture now with
[01:26:26.960 --> 01:26:33.440]  ukraine suspected israeli strikes on iran former israeli ambassador on ramifications and it's
[01:26:34.400 --> 01:26:38.400]  i mean i don't know if israel has admitted this but it's pretty much confirmed israeli
[01:26:38.400 --> 01:26:48.400]  fighter jets israeli bombs blew up what they're claiming were medical supply trucks that were
[01:26:48.400 --> 01:26:59.040]  going to syria and guys there were some other tweets i had on this that uh i don't see on my
[01:26:59.040 --> 01:27:08.160]  desk now i'll go through my stuff here but basically israel is now acting as a us proxy in this war
[01:27:08.160 --> 01:27:21.200]  or and that's why they are bombing supply trains going to syria or what may have ultimately been
[01:27:21.200 --> 01:27:33.920]  meant to go to russia because iran is for lack of a better word on russia's side
[01:27:33.920 --> 01:27:44.800]  in this larger geopolitical conflict and now more is being understood on this issue
[01:27:49.440 --> 01:27:56.800]  because of the bricks set up here's what i was looking for israeli strikes on iran
[01:27:57.360 --> 01:28:01.280]  former israeli ambassador to moscow on what the ramifications will be for ukraine
[01:28:01.280 --> 01:28:09.120]  and is the world on the eve of world war three suspected israeli strikes on iran
[01:28:10.960 --> 01:28:17.840]  could lead to a worse situation so why is israel bombing these supply chains
[01:28:18.480 --> 01:28:26.400]  in iran what does it have to do with the larger geopolitical issue well here's the report from
[01:28:26.400 --> 01:28:31.440]  richard medhurst russia and iran just connected all their banks this is their middle finger to
[01:28:31.440 --> 01:28:39.600]  swift 52 iranian banks under cpam and 106 russian banks under spfs can now talk to each other
[01:28:39.600 --> 01:28:44.720]  weaponizing swift and the us dollar is speeding up the birth of a new system where sanctions don't
[01:28:44.720 --> 01:28:51.920]  work so now thanks to brick and thanks to saudi arabia and russia not doing oil deals in the us
[01:28:51.920 --> 01:28:57.120]  dollar this is the new geopolitical front forming against the corrupt western sanctions

[01:33:17.680 --> 01:33:32.400]  waging war on corruption you're listening to the alex jones show and now your host owin shroyer
[01:33:32.400 --> 01:33:38.080]  so i got a little scatterbrained up against that last break and i couldn't eloquently finish my
[01:33:38.080 --> 01:33:46.000]  point and that's that clearly israel is acting on the us's behalf right now bombing iran bombing
[01:33:46.000 --> 01:33:56.320]  iran supply trains and and what i think is the tit for tat here is basically israel blew up an
[01:33:56.320 --> 01:34:04.320]  iranian drone factory because iran was building drones with the us technology that obama gave them
[01:34:05.120 --> 01:34:11.040]  to supply the russian army in their fight against ukraine so israel went in blew up that and then
[01:34:11.040 --> 01:34:16.480]  they got the green light to go blow up a supply train that was going into syria because the us
[01:34:16.480 --> 01:34:20.960]  is still stealing oil out of there i just kind of wanted to put that out because i have a little
[01:34:20.960 --> 01:34:25.360]  scatterbrained up against the break in the last segment now time to move on and of course this
[01:34:25.360 --> 01:34:29.680]  is dealing with the larger geopolitical issue of the banks the central banks israel's interest
[01:34:29.680 --> 01:34:34.640]  there the west interest there and russia china and others getting off of that system now the
[01:34:34.640 --> 01:34:43.200]  subject material that i have with dr peter mccullough is not short in seriousness or in just
[01:34:43.200 --> 01:34:51.280]  the amount of it that i have but as we bring in dr peter mccullough now uh doctor let's start with
[01:34:51.280 --> 01:34:59.040]  the obvious situation here here's the scale of disaster we're dealing with with the most recent
[01:34:59.040 --> 01:35:04.880]  project veritas phaser video and to me there's no debate this is the scale at the very least at the
[01:35:04.880 --> 01:35:10.400]  very smallest end of the spectrum it's phaser executives are liars that is that is that that
[01:35:10.400 --> 01:35:16.160]  is the worst case situation or excuse me that is the best case situation we have is that top
[01:35:16.160 --> 01:35:24.080]  phaser executives are literally liars that's his own word the worst case scenario is that phaser
[01:35:24.080 --> 01:35:31.760]  is doing gain of function research right here in the united states of america that's the scale here
[01:35:31.760 --> 01:35:36.880]  that is the scale phaser executives are liars is the best case scenario worst case scenario is
[01:35:36.880 --> 01:35:40.800]  they're doing gain of function research in the united states which would be illegal but but
[01:35:40.800 --> 01:35:45.760]  doctor let's get your response to the multiple viral videos from project veritas and then all
[01:35:45.760 --> 01:35:54.000]  of the fallout sense i can tell you i was shocked as a a fellow graduate of ut southwestern medical
[01:35:54.000 --> 01:36:03.120]  school in dallas dr jordan tristan lee walker is a 2018 graduate of southwestern medical school and
[01:36:03.120 --> 01:36:11.760]  then uh he went on to to do at least partial uh rotating internship up in the northeast and he
[01:36:11.760 --> 01:36:20.880]  quickly dropped out of that and and joined phaser uh in research and development and what he disclosed
[01:36:20.880 --> 01:36:29.600]  in this project veritas uh sting operation was i think very important for people to to understand
[01:36:29.600 --> 01:36:37.120]  so uh project veritas under the direction of james oakief had arranged in a sense uh a date
[01:36:37.120 --> 01:36:43.920]  date now um apparently walker is homosexual so it was a male date and they got into a relationship
[01:36:43.920 --> 01:36:51.040]  and as this relationship developed that walker disclosed more and more and i can tell you project
[01:36:51.040 --> 01:36:56.400]  veritas almost certainly has a lot more video than what you see here they uh you know there was a
[01:36:56.400 --> 01:37:05.760]  series of encounters walker discloses that in research meetings phaser has devised plans to
[01:37:05.760 --> 01:37:12.080]  actually intentionally modify sar's kovi to presumably to make it more infectious or potentially
[01:37:12.080 --> 01:37:20.800]  more injurious and then have vaccines to match it uh and and the only way for that to ever
[01:37:21.680 --> 01:37:28.640]  become a commercial entity is for phaser to release the virus publicly now they have labs all over
[01:37:28.640 --> 01:37:34.800]  the world but indeed if it's more infectious or if it's more lethal it does meet the definition of
[01:37:34.800 --> 01:37:41.920]  gain of function research the whole genetic code for sar's kovi two is known and this is enormously
[01:37:41.920 --> 01:37:47.760]  uh disturbing this comes on the heels of phaser ceo who's a veterinarian by the way
[01:37:47.760 --> 01:37:55.680]  albert burla being pursued in davos by uh by a media personnel and they were asking them about
[01:37:55.680 --> 01:38:03.280]  the vaccine now in phaser's documents uh that released publicly under court order phaser knew
[01:38:03.280 --> 01:38:08.960]  about 1,223 deaths within 90 days of their vaccine people called into phaser said their
[01:38:08.960 --> 01:38:14.640]  family members died after they took the phaser vaccine the fda wanted to block this for 55 years
[01:38:14.640 --> 01:38:21.920]  it finally came out uh earlier in 2022 and what borla told the media was that he
[01:38:23.760 --> 01:38:30.720]  knew of no safety signals with his vaccine no safety signals this is a monstrous number of
[01:38:30.720 --> 01:38:37.200]  deaths and i can tell you at 5 10 15 50 deaths uh phaser should have pulled it off the market it
[01:38:37.200 --> 01:38:42.880]  was his responsibility goes all the way up to ceo so you're right owen that phaser executives the
[01:38:42.880 --> 01:38:51.440]  best case scenario is that are lying the worst case scenario is that they're either on the verge of
[01:38:51.440 --> 01:38:58.080]  or in fact they are committing domestic terrorism now you just brought something up about albert
[01:38:58.080 --> 01:39:03.840]  burla and i was kind of waiting on the wings to get into this story and i'm not sure if you've
[01:39:03.840 --> 01:39:08.720]  done the deep dive into this yet but not only are we learning more about burla and his background
[01:39:09.280 --> 01:39:15.440]  being a veterinarian but have you looked into was his specialty gain of function research or
[01:39:15.440 --> 01:39:20.640]  was his specialty looking into uh how viruses communicate with an animal do we know anything
[01:39:20.640 --> 01:39:28.560]  about that no i don't know what his specialty was you know many times the ceo's are just figure heads
[01:39:29.200 --> 01:39:35.680]  for the company but what we've learned is is very disturbing uh burla should have come out
[01:39:35.680 --> 01:39:42.560]  immediately as soon as it was known that these deaths were accruing should have paused the vaccine
[01:39:42.560 --> 01:39:48.880]  should have done a deep dive to figure out what was going on instead of letting these deaths accrue
[01:39:48.880 --> 01:39:54.800]  over the course of two years i think burla is going to hide behind the emergency use authorization
[01:39:54.800 --> 01:40:00.080]  he's going to say listen it was eua i was asked by the governments to do this i didn't have the
[01:40:00.080 --> 01:40:06.000]  ability to stop it he may claim that he doesn't know about these safety signals although the
[01:40:06.000 --> 01:40:13.040]  deaths are clearly recorded in the phaser documents well and plus they can try to use the emergency
[01:40:13.040 --> 01:40:19.440]  authorization use as an excuse that is until we already have the leaked documents they knew about
[01:40:19.440 --> 01:40:26.000]  the side effects so uh correct me if i'm wrong but knowingly putting a product to market even with
[01:40:26.000 --> 01:40:31.280]  the eua you if you have known side effects that you don't warn people about that does that not
[01:40:31.840 --> 01:40:37.280]  relinquish that cover that's very important because what you've just brought up is fraud
[01:40:37.280 --> 01:40:45.520]  uh if phaser defrauded the public in the u.s. government on their vaccines many legal scholars
[01:40:45.520 --> 01:40:52.000]  believe the liability shields should fall and that other charges can be brought against phaser
[01:40:52.000 --> 01:40:57.920]  you know phaser has uh been convicted of criminal activity in the past this wouldn't be the the
[01:40:57.920 --> 01:41:03.360]  first time for it no they're the all-time record they're the all-time home-run hitter
[01:41:03.360 --> 01:41:11.840]  you know again the company's integrity has to or lack thereof has to speak for itself
[01:41:11.840 --> 01:41:18.320]  but these are disturbing developments everything we learned about this project veritas sting
[01:41:18.320 --> 01:41:24.320]  operation uh is greatly concerning and i would anticipate more video more revelations are
[01:41:24.320 --> 01:41:30.720]  going to come out on this you know there was a news piece that came out about phaser and their
[01:41:30.720 --> 01:41:39.280]  um potential gain of function research going on in india and in india is where the was the
[01:41:39.280 --> 01:41:45.840]  birthplace of the delta outbreak and some have raised the issue is could phaser have played a
[01:41:45.840 --> 01:41:52.720]  role in the origins of the delta outbreak in in india if this is if this is uh it needs to be pursued
[01:41:52.720 --> 01:41:59.920]  with with great vigor at this point in time i will be traveling to india within a few days and
[01:41:59.920 --> 01:42:05.200]  hopefully we'll have meetings with the prime minister and other officials and and i anticipate
[01:42:05.200 --> 01:42:09.760]  this will come up in conversation wow this is huge breaking news i don't know if you've stated this
[01:42:09.760 --> 01:42:14.560]  publicly uh but this is huge breaking news to me and then hearing you talk the gears are just
[01:42:14.560 --> 01:42:21.520]  clicking in my head because if i recall india which is i believe still the most populous country in
[01:42:21.520 --> 01:42:27.360]  the world was at first having some vaccine hesitancy and they were seeing the side effects
[01:42:27.360 --> 01:42:31.200]  and they were drawing back saying wait a second maybe we don't want to mass introduce this vaccine
[01:42:31.760 --> 01:42:37.840]  oh and then conveniently the delta variant comes out and phaser has the variant vaccine
[01:42:37.840 --> 01:42:42.080]  in the most populous country that was vaccine skeptical i wonder if there's something there i'm
[01:42:42.880 --> 01:42:47.520]  dr peter mccullough doing hero's work uh as far as i can tell breaking news going to india to
[01:42:47.520 --> 01:42:51.760]  discuss this situation there we'll be right back after this break you won't believe what project
[01:42:51.760 --> 01:42:55.760]  veritas did today though in front of the phaser headquarters we'll show you that on the other

[01:47:30.720 --> 01:47:36.720]  through they rented one of those led screen trucks and parked it right in front of the
[01:47:36.720 --> 01:47:44.880]  fizer world headquarters i believe that's in new york with their video rolling and the image of
[01:47:44.880 --> 01:47:50.000]  their executive who's literally just a liar according to his own words on the screen project
[01:47:50.000 --> 01:47:57.200]  veritas uh just just they should have not closets full of politzer prize awards but probably entire
[01:47:57.200 --> 01:48:02.400]  warehouses full of them of course they don't get the benefit because they're the good guys
[01:48:02.400 --> 01:48:08.480]  and so those corrupt awards no longer get awarded to the good guys dr peter mccullough is with us
[01:48:08.480 --> 01:48:13.680]  now and you to me you broke the big news that you're going to india i think that that's a very
[01:48:14.240 --> 01:48:21.920]  big story because i look at india's leadership uh as they care about the people of india i don't
[01:48:21.920 --> 01:48:25.680]  i don't believe our leaders care about us that's why they keep lying to us about these vaccines
[01:48:25.680 --> 01:48:30.640]  but i i think that the modi and the indian leadership definitely care about the indian
[01:48:30.640 --> 01:48:37.760]  people and so what kind of hopes or what do you expect is going to happen when you are speaking
[01:48:37.760 --> 01:48:42.240]  in india and i think they have a genuine concern about these vaccine side effects
[01:48:43.760 --> 01:48:54.560]  on next tuesday february 7th i'll be headlining a major meeting in a convention center arena
[01:48:54.560 --> 01:49:02.080]  in delhi india and in attendance will be the entire q vive network led by ashutak pantheis
[01:49:02.640 --> 01:49:10.320]  and uh in indian physician leaders dr banerjee being one uh probably the lead barrister in the
[01:49:10.320 --> 01:49:17.200]  entire country preshnath bushanen who's actually taken cases to the supreme court of india regarding
[01:49:17.200 --> 01:49:22.960]  the lack of informed consent and transparency on vaccine data you know india has largely dropped
[01:49:22.960 --> 01:49:28.960]  the vaccines they've had an array of them including the killed vaccines antigen based vaccines and of
[01:49:28.960 --> 01:49:38.080]  course the genetic vaccines overall the population is relatively lightly vaccinated and at this point
[01:49:38.080 --> 01:49:43.920]  in time they are largely through the pandemic it's very it's a very dense country and i had
[01:49:43.920 --> 01:49:50.080]  previously met the personal physician for prime minister modi several years ago in his house and
[01:49:50.080 --> 01:49:56.560]  so i have a relationship we want to certainly have a fair discussion regarding vaccine safety
[01:49:56.560 --> 01:50:04.160]  and efficacy and uh i think this issue about phyzer it's laboratories and any laboratory that's
[01:50:04.160 --> 01:50:11.200]  basically altering the genetic code for sars-cov-2 uh i think there needs to be an immediate global
[01:50:11.200 --> 01:50:18.160]  sweep of who's doing this who who is manipulating the genetic code of sars-cov-2 and we should
[01:50:18.160 --> 01:50:24.880]  have all the files and records this is enormously dangerous and if this has prolonged this pandemic
[01:50:24.880 --> 01:50:32.160]  misery for the world people need to know about it it broke last night project veritas shared the
[01:50:32.160 --> 01:50:39.760]  internal google leaks that they had a quote urgent guidance to censor any and all forms of the most
[01:50:39.760 --> 01:50:46.880]  recent project veritas videos specifically of jordan tristan walker talking about the gain of
[01:50:46.880 --> 01:50:52.400]  function research what he calls directed evolution then the panic attack in the cafe saying i'm
[01:50:52.400 --> 01:50:58.720]  literally just a liar now you've dealt with censorship yourself you've had a little bit of
[01:50:59.360 --> 01:51:04.480]  a look into that keyhole of how it goes down thanks to twitter elan muskin the twitter files we
[01:51:04.480 --> 01:51:09.840]  have now basically a gaping door window into how the censorship goes down but the question here is
[01:51:09.840 --> 01:51:16.240]  obvious who told google to censor these videos did it come from phyzer did it come from the
[01:51:16.240 --> 01:51:22.080]  government your response dr peter mccullough to youtube with an insider leaking these internal
[01:51:22.080 --> 01:51:27.840]  documents with an urgent guidance to ban and censor and remove all forms of this project
[01:51:27.840 --> 01:51:35.200]  veritas video yeah it tells you some people inside youtube are worried and they have uh
[01:51:35.200 --> 01:51:40.640]  you know their morals and ethics on the line and they're leaking it out because they know
[01:51:40.640 --> 01:51:46.400]  something desperately is is wrong inside youtube who's giving the orders that us government through
[01:51:46.400 --> 01:51:56.240]  the fbi the cdc we know that uh scott godlieb a former fga chairman uh was basically giving
[01:51:56.240 --> 01:52:02.560]  directions to twitter to specifically censor information on natural immunity in order to
[01:52:02.560 --> 01:52:10.400]  push more phyzer vaccines as he was a frequent contributor on uh cnbc uh so we know that
[01:52:10.400 --> 01:52:16.640]  certainly it's not beneath anybody who's working for phyzer to directly try to use their influence
[01:52:16.640 --> 01:52:22.320]  through social media uh but at this point in time i think we hopefully can rely on more youtube
[01:52:23.440 --> 01:52:28.560]  whistleblowers and if they are anonymous or if they want to turn states witness there needs to be
[01:52:28.560 --> 01:52:36.080]  an immediate widespread censorship probe here uh this is in the open uh youtube has no position
[01:52:36.080 --> 01:52:41.760]  here to try to put a filter on this you know tucker carlson brought it out on prime time
[01:52:41.760 --> 01:52:47.520]  it's been fully exposed fully exposed here on info wars people want to know well and thank god
[01:52:47.520 --> 01:52:52.640]  for tucker carlson if it wasn't for him it wouldn't even make cable news i've been watching and and
[01:52:52.640 --> 01:52:56.560]  literally that would be the case it's hard to believe folks but it's true now you just brought
[01:52:56.560 --> 01:53:02.400]  something up that i was thinking as well and and i'm gonna issue this to jordan tristan walker one
[01:53:02.400 --> 01:53:10.000]  more time because thanks to the insider whistleblowers at youtube walkers window of opportunity to come
[01:53:10.000 --> 01:53:15.680]  out as a whistleblower has reopened it was closing on him after the freak out and not coming out
[01:53:15.680 --> 01:53:19.520]  immediately and working with phyzer to cover this thing up obviously i'm guessing they told him to
[01:53:19.520 --> 01:53:24.240]  just say you're a liar uh jordan if you really think that you can trust phyzer in this situation
[01:53:24.240 --> 01:53:29.760]  you clearly have not learned anything yet but now thanks to the whistleblower or the leaker at google
[01:53:29.760 --> 01:53:36.400]  or youtube walker your window of opportunity has been reopened now you can be inspired by the youtube
[01:53:36.400 --> 01:53:41.360]  leaker and i believe the only path to redemption for this phyzer executive that has really just
[01:53:41.360 --> 01:53:47.040]  shamed himself in more ways than one his only path to redemption now is to come out as a whistleblower
[01:53:47.040 --> 01:53:52.240]  tell us the truth about what was going on at phyzer uh otherwise i don't see any good outcomes for
[01:53:52.240 --> 01:54:00.080]  this individual do you agree no i agree his uh relatively short career i think is finished he
[01:54:00.080 --> 01:54:06.000]  doesn't have a clinical pathway and likely would never get a residency now to finish
[01:54:06.000 --> 01:54:11.360]  and he shouldn't have any type of pathway in pharmaceutical development at this point in time
[01:54:11.360 --> 01:54:16.160]  i think his only option is to turn states witness he's obviously a bright young man he went to
[01:54:16.160 --> 01:54:22.720]  yell and ut southwestern uh you know he's well trained in in medicine but something's gone wrong
[01:54:22.720 --> 01:54:29.520]  he was on the inside of things with phyzer and uh you know and he did leak very important information
[01:54:29.520 --> 01:54:37.360]  what goes on in these r&d meetings is is really telling you what they're thinking about and when
[01:54:37.360 --> 01:54:42.880]  he said that they were thinking about what's term directed evolution that actually to try to direct
[01:54:42.880 --> 01:54:49.760]  the evolution of the virus so they can get one step ahead of it with vaccines and the specific
[01:54:49.760 --> 01:54:56.560]  comment was uh the question was well wouldn't that be bad for the world and he said yes it would but
[01:54:56.560 --> 01:55:03.440]  it would be good for phyzer i think that told the world everything well and he also says you can't
[01:55:03.440 --> 01:55:07.360]  tell anybody this and we don't want anybody knowing this so i mean obviously he knows what
[01:55:07.360 --> 01:55:12.480]  they're doing was at least morally and ethically wrong but potentially even illegal i don't know
[01:55:12.480 --> 01:55:18.240]  his uh you know how much he knows about the law but you know here's the trend i see and i think
[01:55:18.240 --> 01:55:22.960]  this is going to pick up steam dr peter mccullough and i think last night's story of the youtube
[01:55:22.960 --> 01:55:27.600]  insider leaking the urgent guidance memo uh for everybody to make sure that the project
[01:55:27.600 --> 01:55:33.680]  veritas videos are not seen on youtube anymore i think this is kind of the under or in development
[01:55:33.680 --> 01:55:38.080]  story i think whistleblowers are going to be coming forth left and right i expect whistleblowers
[01:55:38.080 --> 01:55:42.480]  more whistleblowers from big tech whether it's youtube google facebook what have you i expect more
[01:55:42.480 --> 01:55:47.520]  whistleblowers maybe even from phyzer because as you said this cat is out of the back this
[01:55:47.520 --> 01:55:52.480]  genie is out of the bottle and now if you've had any involvement in this you better be making the
[01:55:52.480 --> 01:55:57.760]  realization that your life forward has two paths either come out on the side of good as a whistleblower
[01:55:57.760 --> 01:56:04.000]  leaker state witness whatever or you're going down on this hill of the biggest eugenics program
[01:56:04.000 --> 01:56:07.920]  and the biggest medical malpractice lawsuits that are incoming in world history i mean
[01:56:07.920 --> 01:56:11.760]  these are the two paths i think people are going to realize that and start coming forward as
[01:56:11.760 --> 01:56:18.480]  whistleblowers i agree you know i did bring up this term i think it's very important if there
[01:56:18.480 --> 01:56:25.680]  was contemplation about an intentional release of a new strain you know that that qualifies as
[01:56:25.680 --> 01:56:34.080]  domestic terrorism it's at least conspiring to commit domestic terrorism would be an injured
[01:56:34.080 --> 01:56:40.560]  by a new biological threat so phyzer could answer with this with a new vaccine this should go to
[01:56:40.560 --> 01:56:46.320]  the highest levels of investigation at this point in time and so i guess the question now is i know
[01:56:46.320 --> 01:56:51.600]  you're about to be going to india and and have a major discussion what about interest at the us
[01:56:51.600 --> 01:56:58.400]  level where is that at right now we know that the letters from marco rubio in the us senate within
[01:56:58.400 --> 01:57:05.520]  24 hours went to albert borla another one from uh texas congressman ronnie jackson but we need to
[01:57:05.520 --> 01:57:10.000]  bump it up to a higher level there needs to be special investigative committees and named
[01:57:10.800 --> 01:57:17.520]  and have an immediate probe an immediate probe on corporate corruption and malfeasance i've
[01:57:17.520 --> 01:57:22.560]  already testified in the us senate on december 7 2022 it's in the senate record these vaccines
[01:57:22.560 --> 01:57:27.920]  should all be pulled off the market now while investigations are performed and obviously you've
[01:57:27.920 --> 01:57:32.160]  got your first witness you've got the first guy to subpoena and bring forward into hearings and
[01:57:32.160 --> 01:57:37.920]  that is walker i mean this stuff needs to be moving rapidly we've got dr peter mccullough with us
[01:57:37.920 --> 01:57:43.920]  do not go anywhere folks i still got huge news to cover with him including an msnbc host talking
[01:57:43.920 --> 01:57:53.520]  about her myocarditis oh i talk a lot about the great successes info wars has had i don't think
[01:57:53.520 --> 01:57:59.920]  anybody can deny it and it is because of listeners and viewers supporting us when we talk about the
[01:57:59.920 --> 01:58:05.840]  crew at info wars people behind the scenes the researchers the writers they really have been
[01:58:05.840 --> 01:58:11.040]  the mvps in this fight and we look at harrison smith and oh and stroyer and the hard work they
[01:58:11.040 --> 01:58:17.840]  engage in every day five six seven days a week it's really just incredible so for myself the whole
[01:58:17.840 --> 01:58:23.600]  info wars crew i thank you for your past support i only encourage you now to realize that info wars

[02:00:02.400 --> 02:00:09.360]  MSNBC host jasmine bozeguin was off air for a couple weeks
[02:00:09.360 --> 02:00:16.560]  and she returned to the air to announce why she was off air and she announced it was because of
[02:00:16.560 --> 02:00:23.600]  myocarditis here is that live segment i know from my twitter feed that many of you have
[02:00:23.600 --> 02:00:28.480]  wondered why i have been off the air for a little while well i have been dealing with a little bit
[02:00:28.480 --> 02:00:33.760]  of the health scare on december 20th i began to feel chest pains and they waxed and waned over a
[02:00:33.760 --> 02:00:39.280]  period of 10 days i wasn't quite sure what to make of it but as they continued to get worse i started
[02:00:39.280 --> 02:00:45.600]  to think something was actually wrong it was december 30th when i finally went to an urgent
[02:00:45.600 --> 02:00:51.680]  care and was told i had reflex i didn't really buy it but i was relieved it wasn't my heart
[02:00:52.240 --> 02:00:59.120]  my body though was pretty certain not to believe the reflex the next day on december 30th i woke
[02:00:59.120 --> 02:01:05.120]  up with severe pains both in my chest in my left shoulder and it was like a tightening in my chest
[02:01:05.120 --> 02:01:10.240]  when i took deep breaths that got worse when i was laying flat i knew enough at that moment to
[02:01:10.240 --> 02:01:14.880]  understand that it could mean could is the keyword here that i was having a heart attack especially
[02:01:14.880 --> 02:01:19.760]  because it was happening the left part of my shoulder i want to remind you i run seven miles three
[02:01:19.760 --> 02:01:26.480]  to four times a week where i did um i do yoga i don't eat me i don't smoke i drink occasionally
[02:01:26.480 --> 02:01:30.640]  not right now though because my doctor tells me i can't aside from probably not getting enough
[02:01:30.640 --> 02:01:36.320]  sleep and working too much i'm a pretty healthy person but on that day i was anything but my
[02:01:36.320 --> 02:01:40.240]  husband drove me to the emergency room and from there the nightmare that has been my January
[02:01:40.240 --> 02:01:47.440]  began i was diagnosed with pericarditis inflammation of the lining of my heart brought on by a virus
[02:01:47.440 --> 02:01:54.000]  a literal common cold i also had fluid around my heart that had to be drained or else it could
[02:01:54.000 --> 02:01:59.040]  hinder the beating of my heart i was hospitalized for four nights and transferred from a local hospital
[02:01:59.040 --> 02:02:04.960]  to nyulangone here in york city on january fourth i was finally discharged after doctors
[02:02:04.960 --> 02:02:08.560]  drained the fluid around my heart and i bounced out of the hospital i couldn't get out of there
[02:02:08.560 --> 02:02:14.080]  fast enough with the hopes i was on the mend but that was not the end three days later i was
[02:02:14.080 --> 02:02:19.840]  readmitted when i felt a flutter in my heart like a butterfly it was inside my chest they
[02:02:19.840 --> 02:02:28.640]  determined i had developed myocarditis inflammation of the actual heart now the heart muscle i remember
[02:02:28.640 --> 02:02:34.480]  being separated through the emergency room and wondering is this it it wasn't thank god instead
[02:02:34.480 --> 02:02:38.720]  i spent five more days in the hospital where they were in a battery attest adjust my meds and made
[02:02:38.720 --> 02:02:44.400]  sure nothing else was so this is incredible ladies and gentlemen she's fully vaccinated and i hear
[02:02:44.400 --> 02:02:48.400]  this a lot from vaccinated individuals that are healthy oh i used to run i used to ride bikes i
[02:02:48.400 --> 02:02:53.120]  can't anymore and they're calling it the common cold so we've now heard it oh you're eating eggs
[02:02:53.120 --> 02:02:56.880]  that's why the heart problems are going up oh now they have it this is from the sun
[02:02:58.160 --> 02:03:02.720]  urgent warning to gardeners as soil increases risk of killer heart disease oh you're gardening
[02:03:02.720 --> 02:03:08.080]  that's causing the heart disease but uh dr peter mccullough what's your response to that segment
[02:03:09.280 --> 02:03:14.960]  oh and uh you know my cardiologist i i saw patients all day long yesterday in the office
[02:03:14.960 --> 02:03:23.120]  with this condition myo pericarditis due to covet 19 vaccination uh what she had was a serious
[02:03:23.120 --> 02:03:28.880]  accumulation of fluid around the heart and a condition called pericardial tamponade which
[02:03:28.880 --> 02:03:35.680]  has been reported after covet 19 vaccination you know she was hospitalized multiple times transferred
[02:03:35.680 --> 02:03:41.840]  from one hospital to another this is serious this is not something due to the common cold
[02:03:41.840 --> 02:03:50.160]  so in this type of situation the cautious uh place to be for her and the media
[02:03:50.720 --> 02:03:58.240]  is to make the connection that this is related to covet 19 vaccination because she has a public
[02:03:58.240 --> 02:04:03.680]  health duty to warn others what she's doing is she's abrogating that responsibility and
[02:04:03.680 --> 02:04:09.200]  then trying to blame it on a common cold or some other etiology you know this is in the backdrop
[02:04:09.200 --> 02:04:18.080]  of msnbc is a prominent recipient of white house hhs covet community core funding they are listed
[02:04:18.080 --> 02:04:23.120]  as one of the media outlets that actually took federal dollars to push the vaccine and what
[02:04:23.120 --> 02:04:30.800]  i would want to know in the talking points from hhs was msnbc told to not mention the vaccine
[02:04:30.800 --> 02:04:35.360]  as a cause of complications that's what i would want to know and and just 20 seconds left to the
[02:04:35.360 --> 02:04:42.000]  break have you ever heard of heart problems being caused by a common cold before it's rare
[02:04:42.000 --> 02:04:47.680]  you know certain viral illnesses uh can do it but i can tell you in the clear and present
[02:04:47.680 --> 02:04:53.440]  effects of covet 19 vaccination that is the cause of this problem we'll be right back with more from
[02:04:53.440 --> 02:05:12.640]  dr peter mccullough hey what's up bone hey mcbrane what's going on man excellent hey really like

[02:05:36.080 --> 02:05:44.800]  no okay yeah thanks anyway yeah good luck with that project though
[02:05:44.800 --> 02:05:54.000]  go get your brain force plus and brain force ultra right now at info store dot com
[02:06:04.000 --> 02:06:10.880]  you are listening to an info wars dot com front line report if you are receiving this transmission
[02:06:10.880 --> 02:06:16.080]  you are the resistance and now your host owin shroyer

[02:06:58.000 --> 02:07:06.560]  and you can find them there with dr peter mccullough and so sadly i guess this lady on msnbc
[02:07:06.560 --> 02:07:12.160]  has either put her trust in the wrong doctors or she or the something how does this how do you even
[02:07:12.160 --> 02:07:18.720]  view this situation coming to her having these heart problems the top vaccine side effects it's
[02:07:18.720 --> 02:07:22.720]  well documented at this point we're seeing it everywhere i got more stacks of news on it but
[02:07:22.720 --> 02:07:27.600]  how do we how do you think we've come to this point where she goes off air fully vaccinated
[02:07:27.600 --> 02:07:31.840]  has the main side effects we're seeing in the vaccinated individuals but then is told it was
[02:07:31.840 --> 02:07:37.840]  caused by the common cold or a virus and she goes on air and she does this we know about the funding
[02:07:37.840 --> 02:07:42.720]  we know about the propaganda but i mean how does this even happen how does she go from having the
[02:07:42.720 --> 02:07:47.840]  heart problems to the doctor's office the hospital back on air to then say this is from the flu or
[02:07:47.840 --> 02:07:54.240]  this is from the cold i mean how do you even imagine or envision that going down it's either
[02:07:54.240 --> 02:08:01.280]  she knew or she should have known the cases are mounting thousands of cases of malch
[02:08:01.280 --> 02:08:08.880]  pericarditis in the united states now do after the vaccine and in her case you know she had about
[02:08:08.880 --> 02:08:14.800]  a four inch needle that had to be put into her chest to drain the fluid out oh and this was not
[02:08:14.800 --> 02:08:20.080]  a trivial thing she was hospitalized twice that's what we're finding with myo pericarditis
[02:08:20.080 --> 02:08:27.680]  after COVID-19 vaccination multiple papers have shown this now that the majority of cases are serious
[02:08:28.400 --> 02:08:33.040]  and they weren't hospitalization so i want people to understand this very clearly when
[02:08:33.040 --> 02:08:39.920]  there's chest symptoms that develop after COVID-19 vaccines take it seriously she did and you see
[02:08:39.920 --> 02:08:45.600]  what happened hospitalized multiple times remember she said she was she said she was told is esophageal
[02:08:45.600 --> 02:08:53.040]  reflux and she felt blown off she was right so my point is take it seriously and msnbc uh the media
[02:08:53.040 --> 02:08:58.640]  anchors and others they need to come out clean and uh and start you're fulfilling their public
[02:08:58.640 --> 02:09:05.440]  health responsibility and implicating the vaccine as they should when these events happen i mean if
[02:09:05.440 --> 02:09:10.000]  she would have not gone with what i'm assuming was her gut instinct to go back to the hospital
[02:09:10.000 --> 02:09:15.280]  saying this isn't reflux if she doesn't go back after that what kind of health problems might
[02:09:15.280 --> 02:09:21.120]  she be dealing with today well she could have had a cardiopulmonary arrest due to pericardial
[02:09:21.120 --> 02:09:25.920]  tamponade and so i want people to understand this when fluid builds up around the heart it puts so
[02:09:25.920 --> 02:09:32.400]  much tension on the heart itself it basically crushes the heart it can't fill and individuals can
[02:09:32.400 --> 02:09:39.520]  have cardiopulmonary arrests we know in two autopsy studies one from Schwab and one from Chavez
[02:09:39.520 --> 02:09:46.320]  that 70 to 80 percent of deaths after vaccination are due to vaccine problems like myocarditis
[02:09:46.320 --> 02:09:53.680]  blood clots uh and and fatal intracranial hemorrhages and uh strokes so you know i wonder
[02:09:53.680 --> 02:09:59.200]  how many of these deaths occur after COVID-19 vaccination in fact may have been pericardial
[02:09:59.200 --> 02:10:04.160]  tamponade cases and that could have happened to her it's it's that serious you could tell
[02:10:04.160 --> 02:10:09.760]  that by the look in her face she understood it was serious uh and she understood she almost
[02:10:09.760 --> 02:10:15.200]  looked to me like she felt burned by this whole thing and that's the look of someone who's not
[02:10:15.200 --> 02:10:21.440]  burned by a common cold she looks burned and angry because she's taken a COVID-19 vaccine and she's
[02:10:21.440 --> 02:10:26.640]  just not saying it on air interesting you know that's an interesting read that you have there
[02:10:27.200 --> 02:10:32.640]  and if that is the case i think it's sad and i guess hey look she probably has a nice salary
[02:10:32.640 --> 02:10:36.080]  and a nice job she doesn't want to get rid of and maybe that's why she doesn't want to make an
[02:10:36.080 --> 02:10:41.920]  issue of this uh but i think should that be the case as we mentioned earlier i think it's going
[02:10:41.920 --> 02:10:45.920]  to give eventually eventually not everybody's going to sell their souls out for money not
[02:10:45.920 --> 02:10:50.160]  everybody's going to be that desperate to say stay on tv or whatever the case may be and and
[02:10:50.160 --> 02:10:53.520]  the next time or the next time or the next time eventually somebody's going to come on air and say
[02:10:53.520 --> 02:10:58.000]  you know what i had a vaccine side effect i was told to lie to you about it it was covered up even
[02:10:58.000 --> 02:11:02.960]  in the hospital and here's what i'm going to tell you now uh and so i i mean i i kind of expect that
[02:11:02.960 --> 02:11:06.960]  to happen and and just briefly for people that are listening and maybe you've gotten the vaccine
[02:11:06.960 --> 02:11:12.080]  you're worried about this just re-emphasize if you have questions or you're feeling something
[02:11:12.080 --> 02:11:18.560]  weird in your chest i mean what what do you suggest people do if people have significant
[02:11:18.560 --> 02:11:24.960]  chest symptoms chest pain effort intolerance uh they do need to see a doctor preferably a cardiologist
[02:11:24.960 --> 02:11:31.040]  i do a series of blood tests ekg in her case the echocardiogram would have found fluid around the
[02:11:31.040 --> 02:11:37.280]  heart and then the definitive test is cardiac mri and i anticipate when she came back the second time
[02:11:37.840 --> 02:11:42.400]  she actually had a cardiac mri and it showed involvement not only the pericardium but the
[02:11:42.400 --> 02:11:49.200]  myocardium uh and that would be diagnostic of covet 19 vaccine induced myocarditis there's a
[02:11:49.200 --> 02:11:54.880]  paper by bowmeyer and and colleagues from germany in cases like hers when they did biopsies oh and
[02:11:54.880 --> 02:12:01.680]  and they found the vaccine spike protein in the heart so this is clear it's due to the vaccine
[02:12:01.680 --> 02:12:05.680]  you know i was going to jump to another subject but you just brought up the spike protein and
[02:12:07.120 --> 02:12:11.920]  look i i don't i'm not a doctor i only understand this because i've talked to doctors like peter
[02:12:11.920 --> 02:12:16.000]  mccullough and i've heard other lectures from other frontline doctors and such so so i can
[02:12:16.000 --> 02:12:20.960]  understand this now but but we need to get dr peter mccullough's response where there's two major
[02:12:20.960 --> 02:12:26.000]  developments happening right now that the the average layman that doesn't understand medical
[02:12:26.000 --> 02:12:32.480]  nuance is missing and that's one the spike protein issue which with with fizer in this most recent
[02:12:32.480 --> 02:12:37.920]  video basically admits that they knew the spike protein response that the mRNA vaccines is putting
[02:12:37.920 --> 02:12:43.760]  out is for a virus that's two to three years past its mutation so they're so they knew they were
[02:12:43.760 --> 02:12:47.840]  giving you a virus that was already expired already defunct it's like selling somebody a
[02:12:47.840 --> 02:12:56.400]  carton of expired milk that's illegal but in the project veritas videos the executive walker
[02:12:56.400 --> 02:13:02.000]  basically admits that they know what's going on when he's talking about the directed evolution
[02:13:02.000 --> 02:13:07.280]  research folks you gotta understand the nuanced medical speak here that means that they know
[02:13:07.280 --> 02:13:11.520]  the vaccines they're selling you were already expired they know that the vaccines they were
[02:13:11.520 --> 02:13:16.000]  selling you were for a virus that has already mutated five six seven times and that that's
[02:13:16.000 --> 02:13:20.800]  why they were doing the research i mean talk about that bombshell that most people wouldn't
[02:13:20.800 --> 02:13:29.040]  understand that's an important uh observation on that in fact they know the original wuhan
[02:13:29.040 --> 02:13:35.840]  institute of virology spike protein the ancestral strain has been long extinct for a couple years
[02:13:35.840 --> 02:13:42.560]  now so fizer's recognizing this even their bivalent b a four b a five vaccines are already
[02:13:42.560 --> 02:13:49.200]  obsolete b a four and b a five is less than three percent of strains by the cdc nowcast system which
[02:13:49.200 --> 02:13:56.960]  is very accurate we now have bq and xbb as the common omicron sub variants so all vaccines
[02:13:56.960 --> 02:14:03.200]  that are being offered right now are completely obsolete they have no theoretical chance of
[02:14:03.840 --> 02:14:08.800]  containing the virus and as i've pointed out they should all be removed from the market there's
[02:14:08.800 --> 02:14:14.800]  no hope that they're gonna work or have worked folks this is like the analogy would be if i
[02:14:14.800 --> 02:14:22.240]  walk into a dallas cowboys game in for the for the 2022 season or 2023 season and i walk into
[02:14:22.880 --> 02:14:29.200]  the dallas cowboy stadium and there's a guy who's selling programs and the program is from the year
[02:14:29.200 --> 02:14:34.640]  2000 and i walk up or 2020 i say hey i'd like a program he says here's your program and it's the
[02:14:34.640 --> 02:14:40.240]  2020 season and as the 2020 team schedule and the 2020 team roster but them telling you this is
[02:14:40.240 --> 02:14:44.480]  oh this is the new team this is the this is the program no this is a two years old program
[02:14:44.480 --> 02:14:49.760]  they knew they were selling you a vaccine that was expired i dr peter mccullough i can't sell a
[02:14:49.760 --> 02:14:56.720]  supplement that's expired they can't sell a vaccine that they know is expired they can't and uh under
[02:14:56.720 --> 02:15:02.000]  no circumstances should people take this you know people should know that there is no hope
[02:15:02.000 --> 02:15:08.240]  that the vaccines can possibly do anything beneficial against the current strains of virus
[02:15:08.240 --> 02:15:13.360]  and not only that but you know a harvard study by clausen and colleagues have shown 94 percent
[02:15:13.360 --> 02:15:17.440]  of americans have already been through respiratory covet whether or not they've taken a vaccine they've
[02:15:17.440 --> 02:15:22.320]  already been through respiratory covet and we know once somebody's covet recovered they have
[02:15:22.320 --> 02:15:29.040]  a negligible chance of any serious outcomes with another version and in a paper by chen and colleagues
[02:15:29.040 --> 02:15:35.760]  doing a general medicine october of 2022 for those who had covet through the delta or omicron
[02:15:35.760 --> 02:15:43.200]  outbreaks there was in that study there was zero chance of hospitalization and death among 59 000
[02:15:43.200 --> 02:15:50.000]  prisoners 17 000 staff oh and i can tell you we are through the pandemic uh president biden has
[02:15:50.000 --> 02:15:53.920]  has scheduled the end of the emergency that's right and i want to talk to you about that on
[02:15:53.920 --> 02:16:00.240]  the other side of this break don't go anywhere you want to beat the new world order you want to

[02:20:39.360 --> 02:20:45.760]  before we went to the break joe biden to end COVID-19 emergency declarations on may 11th oh on
[02:20:45.760 --> 02:20:52.640]  may 11th uh the question here is obvious Dr. McCullough what is the science behind choosing the
[02:20:52.640 --> 02:21:00.560]  day may 11th and is there any science behind it there's two levels of emergency declarations one
[02:21:00.560 --> 02:21:06.240]  is the presidential declaration of a national emergency and then the secretary of health and
[02:21:06.240 --> 02:21:14.800]  humans services declaration of a public health emergency they should only be determined by
[02:21:14.800 --> 02:21:25.200]  doctors and the most common state and local definition for SARS-CoV-2 was when we exceeded
[02:21:25.200 --> 02:21:32.560]  15% of hospital capacity with COVID pneumonia patients that would be considered a public
[02:21:32.560 --> 02:21:39.360]  health emergency it means that we couldn't handle the other cases that went away oh and in january
[02:21:39.360 --> 02:21:47.200]  of 2021 so the emergency declaration should have been dropped in january of 2021 and governments
[02:21:47.200 --> 02:21:54.000]  have had a habit of hanging on to emergency declarations as a means to hanging on to power
[02:21:54.000 --> 02:22:01.440]  this has happened before with other declarations of emergencies in 1976 we enacted the public
[02:22:01.440 --> 02:22:06.640]  health emergencies act in order to actually end emergencies that was the whole purpose of the
[02:22:06.640 --> 02:22:12.720]  legislation because the executive branch became power hungry now we hear that biden wants to
[02:22:12.720 --> 02:22:20.480]  schedule this we don't schedule or unschedule a health emergency you can tell just by that action
[02:22:20.480 --> 02:22:26.240]  alone that the declaration of emergencies is basically been a manipulated power grab
[02:22:27.440 --> 02:22:32.960]  yeah and of course once you give government the power they very rarely if ever relinquish it and
[02:22:32.960 --> 02:22:37.520]  with commies and american leftists you give them a thimble of power they'll find a way to abuse it
[02:22:37.520 --> 02:22:42.480]  and conquer you with it we're learning that the hard way now this is just the stack of news i have
[02:22:42.480 --> 02:22:48.240]  on my desk today it's like this every day here's um here's here's some individuals who it appear may
[02:22:48.240 --> 02:22:52.880]  have died from covid vaccine side effects they won't tell you 23 year old university of arizona
[02:22:52.880 --> 02:22:58.880]  swimmer tie wells dies suddenly heart problems pain in spain journalist sandra carmona died age
[02:22:58.880 --> 02:23:04.880]  42 heart problems she was a big vaccine advocate and and push her fully boosted shock as top rate
[02:23:04.880 --> 02:23:10.800]  new jersey athlete collapses during game a rozel catholic basketball player top ranked in high
[02:23:10.800 --> 02:23:19.680]  school juniors class collapsed on the court sunday um he did not die um thank god still with us
[02:23:19.680 --> 02:23:24.640]  but i mean it's every day dr mccullough it's every day i have stacks of these news dies
[02:23:24.640 --> 02:23:28.960]  suddenly heart problems athletes fit people healthy people i have friends i have family telling me
[02:23:28.960 --> 02:23:35.440]  the same thing when does this stop when do we when do we when do we ask the question of what is
[02:23:35.440 --> 02:23:42.480]  going on here there's a public health obligation for the families uh in each and every case to come
[02:23:42.480 --> 02:23:48.480]  out and indicate if they've taken a vaccine or not lead cardiologist dr asim al-hotra myself
[02:23:48.480 --> 02:23:55.200]  have done a little mini documentary video on this it's titled until proven otherwise meaning that a
[02:23:55.200 --> 02:24:01.840]  safe conservative regulatory stands is because the vaccines cause myocarditis and blood clots and
[02:24:01.840 --> 02:24:06.640]  because the peer-reviewed literature says these conditions can be fatal we should assume these
[02:24:06.640 --> 02:24:13.920]  cases are due to the covet 19 vaccine as the cause of death until proven otherwise on my podcast that
[02:24:13.920 --> 02:24:20.880]  just uh hit this week today uh uh an america loud talk radio mccullough report i feature a french
[02:24:21.520 --> 02:24:28.800]  analyst mark giardot whose theory is that some individuals actually get a mainline injection
[02:24:28.800 --> 02:24:33.920]  of the lipid nanoparticles and rna that go to the heart and other vital organs because there's no
[02:24:33.920 --> 02:24:40.720]  aspiration of the plunger to see if they're in a small capillary or venial in the deltoid another
[02:24:40.720 --> 02:24:46.800]  theory is that athletes uh take a bigger hit because they have a greater vasculature in their
[02:24:46.800 --> 02:24:53.360]  deltoid muscle and so they get a more vigorous uh circulation of lipid nanoparticles to vital
[02:24:53.360 --> 02:25:00.240]  organs it takes a lot to kill a 20 you know a 25 year old man or woman who's an athlete
[02:25:00.240 --> 02:25:07.120]  i can tell you this it takes a lot and i've been so impressed with how severe the myocarditis is uh
[02:25:07.120 --> 02:25:12.480]  the electrical disturbances the fatal arrhythmias and fatal blood clots these vaccines are deadly
[02:25:12.480 --> 02:25:19.440]  and they should be taken off the market now the american media cable news network specifically
[02:25:19.440 --> 02:25:24.320]  mainstream media has given the blackout probably under orders or maybe feeling guilt for pushing
[02:25:24.320 --> 02:25:32.160]  this vaccine they've blacked out the project veritas story and video but yet china is covering it
[02:25:32.160 --> 02:25:36.560]  it's all over the news in china and based on your response you you may not be aware of that
[02:25:36.560 --> 02:25:40.800]  project veritas did a screenshot here of all the different chinese media outlets covering their video
[02:25:40.800 --> 02:25:46.320]  playing the video now obviously india has interest in this you know this firsthand now china is a
[02:25:46.320 --> 02:25:51.600]  little more walled off to uh we'll say western influence than perhaps india but uh what do you
[02:25:51.600 --> 02:25:58.880]  make of chinese media covering this not just more than the american media i mean like a thousand times
[02:25:58.880 --> 02:26:09.040]  more recall that china in 2021 quickly threw out phyzer as a vaccine vendor in china chinese there's
[02:26:09.040 --> 02:26:14.880]  a chinese menu of like 12 different vaccines in china the majority of them are antigen based
[02:26:14.880 --> 02:26:19.920]  vaccines they feature the sign of that coronavac killed virus vaccine but they threw phyzer out
[02:26:19.920 --> 02:26:25.040]  early and i'm not surprised now that they are revealing what looks like widespread phyzer
[02:26:25.040 --> 02:26:31.760]  corruption and malfeasance now i don't know if you have seen this one yet either and this is
[02:26:31.760 --> 02:26:35.840]  kind of just breaking today i've got a whole video maybe we'll have time to air this later on the show
[02:26:35.840 --> 02:26:41.680]  but george webb and others have been doing research that has finally made it to james oakheap
[02:26:41.680 --> 02:26:45.920]  jordan tristan walker helped write the boston consulting group white paper that recommended
[02:26:45.920 --> 02:26:52.240]  remdesivir only a few days after fda emergency approval for the full story of rebecca go to
[02:26:52.240 --> 02:26:57.920]  mark kulott's youtube channel houston onik live and i and people told me i butchered that name i
[02:26:57.920 --> 02:27:02.080]  apologize i i'm not doing it intentionally i'm just not familiar with them and now he's celebrating
[02:27:02.080 --> 02:27:07.440]  because oakheap is aware of it five days of sleepless nights to get walker bcg info to james oakheap
[02:27:07.440 --> 02:27:11.440]  finally mission accomplished i now realize gatekeepers were keeping this critical data from him
[02:27:11.440 --> 02:27:15.920]  oakheap tweets out boston consulting group paper jordan walker phyzer director of our
[02:27:15.920 --> 02:27:20.320]  video is one of the authors josh keller is also an author a managing partner at ball
[02:27:20.320 --> 02:27:27.120]  boston consulting and it goes on um do you think maybe there's more liability here with the
[02:27:27.120 --> 02:27:33.280]  walker story and do you think he might have been kind of used as a yes man as a as a fall guy
[02:27:33.280 --> 02:27:41.280]  uh for this entire operation it's possible you know george webb a very credible he uh took
[02:27:41.280 --> 02:27:46.880]  the vaccine himself he got myocarditis the reporter you mentioned he had buy he had basically vaccine
[02:27:46.880 --> 02:27:53.520]  induced myocarditis uh himself so he's clearly you know wanting to seek the truth on this boston
[02:27:53.520 --> 02:28:01.360]  consulting group appears to be a key figure in trying to push various um pandemic response
[02:28:01.360 --> 02:28:07.360]  measures that are lucrative like remdesivir and like vaccines we know a lot of the um
[02:28:07.360 --> 02:28:13.920]  operations here are done through consultants so i think boston consulting now is brought into this
[02:28:13.920 --> 02:28:19.200]  fold of uh being implicated and you're right walker may have been in a sense kind of an
[02:28:19.200 --> 02:28:24.320]  operative push between these two uh as he was finding his way he was obviously plucked out of
[02:28:24.320 --> 02:28:31.040]  his internship and became active in this space this has been an amazing interview with dr peter

[02:34:55.040 --> 02:34:59.200]  maria z takes over i've got stack of other stacks of other news here i want to just start to pile
[02:34:59.200 --> 02:35:06.800]  drive through like this and this is the kind of stuff that motivates me to want to watch a movie
[02:35:06.800 --> 02:35:15.200]  or support an actor shazam star zachery levy 42 is slammed online for tweets agreeing that covet
[02:35:15.200 --> 02:35:22.080]  vaccine maker fiser is a danger to the world just one month before his new sequel is released now
[02:35:22.080 --> 02:35:28.320]  i'm not seeing the original shazam but now i'm curious to go watch it with a hollywood actor
[02:35:28.320 --> 02:35:36.480]  that doesn't hate my guts and hasn't sold his soul so now i like zachery levy and i'm interested to
[02:35:36.480 --> 02:35:42.320]  watch his movies but imagine disagreeing with that imagine thinking that's controversial
[02:35:42.320 --> 02:35:48.960]  fiser who settled the biggest medical malpractice lawsuits in us history and now fiser whose
[02:35:48.960 --> 02:35:55.040]  executives multiple undercover project veritas video has exposed what their shenanigans and
[02:35:55.040 --> 02:35:59.040]  corruption is really about with undercover videos and imagine disagreeing thinking fiser
[02:36:00.160 --> 02:36:05.360]  is not a danger to the world you are under stockholm syndrome or you are either a liar
[02:36:05.360 --> 02:36:12.000]  or brainwashed if that's how you feel but aside from that this guy isn't allowed to speak his mind
[02:36:12.000 --> 02:36:17.600]  if he would have come out and called vaccine skeptics racists and terrorists then he would have been
[02:36:18.480 --> 02:36:22.480]  celebrated by the mainstream media but because he tells the truth about fiser he gets attacked so
[02:36:22.480 --> 02:36:27.440]  don't be surprised that this is his last big hollywood deal so let's go support that movie
[02:36:27.440 --> 02:36:32.960]  and make that pain even worse for them trying to cancel him even though he gets top selling movies
[02:36:32.960 --> 02:36:38.560]  because australian heart of australian health authorities call for more covet boosters but
[02:36:38.560 --> 02:36:43.760]  the public says no australia and new zealand suffered some of the worst pandemic mandate
[02:36:43.760 --> 02:36:48.720]  conditions of any country in the western world crossing the line into totalitarianism on a
[02:36:48.720 --> 02:36:55.440]  number of occasions but now that their governments are continuing to promote the covet vaccines
[02:36:55.440 --> 02:37:03.680]  the citizens are increasingly saying no thank you this is a sign of victory because i guess
[02:37:03.680 --> 02:37:11.840]  they really thought they could force 10 of these shots into your arm and kill you and we won folks
[02:37:11.840 --> 02:37:17.360]  we won the info war and you know what that's that's a sad thing to say because i don't forget the
[02:37:17.360 --> 02:37:24.880]  people that have died in this phase i have friends and family that are vaccine damaged and some have
[02:37:24.880 --> 02:37:34.720]  died so i don't i don't say this lightly or celebratory i'm just saying that we're we've
[02:37:34.720 --> 02:37:39.760]  won the info war people now know the vaccines are deadly and people are now willing to state it and
[02:37:39.760 --> 02:37:46.080]  die on this hill and it's so obvious at this point that now even the most authoritarian countries
[02:37:46.960 --> 02:37:52.960]  like australia and new zealand pushing these vaccines onto their citizens the citizens are
[02:37:52.960 --> 02:37:57.040]  now saying no thank you we know what this is really about this is a huge victory folks
[02:37:59.040 --> 02:38:07.920]  truly it truly is and again i can't even celebrate it because of all the people that have died
[02:38:08.800 --> 02:38:14.720]  in this process but it is a sign we're winning and so i really think they thought they could
[02:38:14.720 --> 02:38:19.840]  roll this out put you in fear stick 10 of these jabs in your arm and blow your heart out and it
[02:38:19.840 --> 02:38:26.800]  ain't working so what are they going to do next to try to cover it up or to try to deceive you
[02:38:27.520 --> 02:38:30.560]  into taking one of these shots before here's an example of why sadly
[02:38:31.440 --> 02:38:36.560]  grieving mom speaks out on the death of her 23 year old daughter here it is in clip six
[02:38:42.720 --> 02:38:48.560]  they were pro-vaccine we you know thought the people who wouldn't get the vaccine or thought
[02:38:48.560 --> 02:38:53.280]  covid weren't wasn't real was silly i'm not andy vaxer i'm not conspiracy theorist i'm just a
[02:38:53.280 --> 02:39:00.720]  normal person then one day my daughter dropped dead and all of this i just started i just the
[02:39:00.720 --> 02:39:06.400]  only thing i wish i wish i wish i had been aware of this before i wish i had have looked i wish i
[02:39:06.400 --> 02:39:12.400]  had have researched i just every other minute i think uh because she was my best friend you know
[02:39:12.400 --> 02:39:22.720]  i think i'll i'll just talk to katelyn but she's not here i think there are so many um signs um
[02:39:22.720 --> 02:39:31.120]  my name's raylene kennedy i'm the mum of katelyn gotz katelyn uh it's her birthday today 12th of
[02:39:31.120 --> 02:39:43.360]  february she's 24 today um 12 weeks ago 17th of november 2021 she dropped dead at work um
[02:39:47.040 --> 02:39:52.160]  the coroner has told us that uh to she was perfect there was absolutely no reason except that she
[02:39:52.160 --> 02:39:57.520]  had an enlarged heart and they're doing histology for six months the coroner has said i need to
[02:39:57.520 --> 02:40:03.600]  uh be prepared for at the end of that six months for a determination of undetermined as her cause
[02:40:03.600 --> 02:40:10.960]  of death i'm not prepared for a determination of undetermined um she died there is a reason she died
[02:40:10.960 --> 02:40:15.760]  how can they say in this day and age that they they don't can't work out why she died she had an
[02:40:15.760 --> 02:40:21.440]  enlarged heart that was the only thing she'd been sick since the day didn't ask for any
[02:40:21.440 --> 02:40:30.000]  uh chronological any time frame any uh events surrounding her death asked for nothing all
[02:40:30.000 --> 02:40:35.520]  they've done is um the Australian vaccine register they've sealed the record so can't find her
[02:40:35.520 --> 02:40:44.800]  batch number or anything um i gay i sent in i emailed them in pretty heartbreaking stuff there
[02:40:44.800 --> 02:40:52.800]  there and again you just i've had to be faced with this long enough but others are starting to
[02:40:52.800 --> 02:40:59.120]  realize it how how cold how evil how diabolical how separated from the human soul you have to be
[02:41:02.000 --> 02:41:06.080]  to promote a program like this that you know has killed hundreds of thousands of people
[02:41:06.080 --> 02:41:12.160]  from australia to the united states and everywhere in between you knew it was going to happen and
[02:41:12.160 --> 02:41:18.560]  you continue to promote it and push it and say it's safe and effective it's really even hard to fathom
[02:41:18.560 --> 02:41:24.960]  how evil that is how cold that is how completely separated from the human soul you have to be
[02:41:25.760 --> 02:41:33.920]  to feel no remorse to feel nothing but to roll out a program that you know is going to kill
[02:41:33.920 --> 02:41:39.280]  potentially millions of people if not more worldwide and do it with a straight face and
[02:41:39.280 --> 02:41:49.600]  say safe and effective and you knew the whole time and little boys and little girls sons and
[02:41:49.600 --> 02:41:56.720]  daughters grandparents fathers mothers people losing their loved ones because of this COVID-19
[02:41:56.720 --> 02:42:01.360]  vaccine that they told you was safe and effective and forced into your arm manipulated you into
[02:42:01.360 --> 02:42:11.200]  getting it and they feel no remorse at all none none it's pretty hard to imagine isn't it pretty
[02:42:11.200 --> 02:42:21.920]  hard to fathom you really probably can't even put yourself into that state of being because you
[02:42:21.920 --> 02:42:32.720]  still have a soul but that's what we're dealing with that is the cold diabolical soulless nature
[02:42:33.760 --> 02:42:39.520]  of the globalists of big pharma of big tech and all their friends in the mainstream media
[02:42:40.320 --> 02:42:43.520]  and the u.s. government and the federal government this is what we're dealing with folks
[02:42:44.320 --> 02:42:48.720]  this is what we're up against and this is why it's worth it because humanity is worth it
[02:42:48.720 --> 02:42:55.600]  and and saving humanity from these diabolical eugenicists is the mission

[02:47:13.600 --> 02:47:21.120]  all right let me do a news blitz here before guest host maria z takes over and we hear
[02:47:21.120 --> 02:47:28.400]  about this situation of jordan tristan walker helping write the boston consulting group white
[02:47:28.400 --> 02:47:33.600]  people a white paper that recommended remdesivir which we know how devastating that was quickly
[02:47:33.600 --> 02:47:40.560]  though let's do a news blitz cleborn county arkansas rejects voting machines will move to
[02:47:40.560 --> 02:47:49.440]  paper ballots now i didn't go into the political data here to figure out much about cleburne
[02:47:50.000 --> 02:47:56.400]  and i don't want to spend too much time on it now but i'll go ahead and just make a blind
[02:47:56.400 --> 02:48:04.480]  bet right now that a democrat ain't winning anything in cleburne county arkansas for a long time
[02:48:06.560 --> 02:48:13.920]  just gonna make a safe probably ill-informed bet there but you know paper ballots hand counting
[02:48:14.560 --> 02:48:19.040]  doesn't bode well for democrats and you notice it's not democrats to do it so i'm confident that's
[02:48:19.040 --> 02:48:25.040]  probably not a democrat district but hey could be wrong proved me wrong exclusive interview with
[02:48:25.040 --> 02:48:32.160]  michael indel you're playing a football game on a rigged field michael indel discusses election
[02:48:32.160 --> 02:48:40.480]  integrity after rnc chairman election of ron mcdaniel says he will be on jimmy kimmel live
[02:48:40.480 --> 02:48:47.680]  tuesday is michael indel gonna be on jimmy kimmel tonight that should be interesting looking forward
[02:48:47.680 --> 02:48:56.240]  to that now this situation with tyree nickles continues to get weirder mephis fire department
[02:48:56.240 --> 02:49:00.880]  fires three emergency responders for failing to provide adequate medical care to tyree nickles
[02:49:00.880 --> 02:49:08.080]  and a sixth police officer has been relieved as of his duty as well so we're up to nine people
[02:49:08.080 --> 02:49:12.720]  by my count that have been relieved of duty because of this now just because people are
[02:49:12.720 --> 02:49:16.560]  sending me this stuff i want to address something and i'm not going to give it too much fire right
[02:49:16.560 --> 02:49:20.320]  now i'm not going to give it too much gasoline simply because i'm not convinced of any of it
[02:49:20.320 --> 02:49:25.360]  i haven't seen enough credible evidence but um there are of course the conspiracy theories
[02:49:25.360 --> 02:49:30.560]  and the rumors out there about some other stuff that was happening behind the scenes that really
[02:49:30.560 --> 02:49:37.600]  led to that situation with tyree nickles and you know it's so unexplainable and it's so inhumane
[02:49:38.560 --> 02:49:43.200]  you almost can't even believe that this this is just an organic situation that popped up
[02:49:43.200 --> 02:49:47.600]  that there maybe wasn't something else going on but i haven't seen enough stuff that this is credible
[02:49:47.600 --> 02:49:51.760]  for me to jump to any conclusions or to report on any of that but some people are sending it
[02:49:51.760 --> 02:49:58.000]  to me i thought i'd at least throw that out there but again the the the obvious response here is
[02:49:58.560 --> 02:50:03.200]  the situation that we saw in the tyree nickles video is a thousand times worse than we saw in
[02:50:03.200 --> 02:50:08.320]  the george floyd video but the response to the george floyd video was a thousand times worse
[02:50:08.320 --> 02:50:13.600]  than what we saw from the tyree nickles video you go figure that one out oh here we go they'd
[02:50:13.600 --> 02:50:20.800]  love christianity not jesus could have been transgender claims cambridge dean these people
[02:50:20.800 --> 02:50:30.080]  you're just disgusting freaks jesus could have been transgender okay okay libtard's gonna libtard
[02:50:30.080 --> 02:50:33.760]  but they really just hate christianity and and really they just hate religion because it
[02:50:33.760 --> 02:50:42.560]  it it it doesn't force you to go into a higher moral state or a higher moral consciousness
[02:50:43.520 --> 02:50:48.560]  but that's the idea behind it that's the practice behind it and that's how you raise your children
[02:50:49.360 --> 02:50:56.160]  in religions whether it's christianity or whether it's your jewish or muslim or anything else you
[02:50:56.160 --> 02:51:00.480]  want to it has values ethics morals and you're supposed to raise your family like that that's
[02:51:00.480 --> 02:51:05.120]  why the left degenerates hate it that's why the trannies and and the sex perverts and the pedophiles
[02:51:05.680 --> 02:51:11.680]  and the militant lgbtq army hate it because they don't like moral standards they don't
[02:51:11.680 --> 02:51:15.760]  like people having moral standards in comparison to them they want the moral high ground even
[02:51:15.760 --> 02:51:22.560]  though they're the degenerates whoopee golberg she's not very smart and she said one of the
[02:51:22.560 --> 02:51:27.360]  dumbest things she's ever said maybe and that's saying a lot after five black cops fatally beat
[02:51:27.360 --> 02:51:33.120]  black man whoopee golberg says quote do we need to see white people also get beaten up before anybody
[02:51:33.120 --> 02:51:38.000]  will do anything maybe that's what whoopee would like to see even though that happens all the time
[02:51:38.000 --> 02:51:43.760]  in fact it's become a viral phenomenon people sharing police brutality videos of white people
[02:51:43.760 --> 02:51:47.600]  getting killed by police that never make the mainstream media because they have the wrong
[02:51:47.600 --> 02:51:52.000]  skin color so it already is happening whoopee in fact more black more white people are killed by
[02:51:52.000 --> 02:51:58.560]  police than black people every year you just don't cover it and you don't even care to look
[02:51:58.560 --> 02:52:04.240]  into it either you just only want to spout off your ill-informed ignorant opinions and your
[02:52:04.240 --> 02:52:10.880]  propaganda but i would just say this then because we can all play this game how many black babies
[02:52:10.880 --> 02:52:21.920]  have to get aborted before we will do anything oh oh i see so the black guy that gets beaten up and
[02:52:21.920 --> 02:52:28.240]  killed by police is enough for whoopee golberg to make a blatantly racist statement but when
[02:52:29.040 --> 02:52:35.600]  tens of thousands or hundreds of thousands of black babies are aborted killed in this country
[02:52:35.600 --> 02:52:42.000]  every year whoopee golberg says nothing she loves it actually she's a big fan of killing black babies
[02:52:42.560 --> 02:52:47.360]  so how many black babies have to die whoopee golberg before you will do anything about abortion i
[02:52:47.360 --> 02:52:55.280]  would ask millionaire bernie sanders charging 95 a ticket for an event where he tells you why
[02:52:55.280 --> 02:53:03.520]  capitalism is bad i just have a good laugh at that one we all laugh at that uh liberals gonna
[02:53:03.520 --> 02:53:08.320]  liberal here's another good liberal democrat who's a fraud steve curry the biden supporting democrat
[02:53:08.320 --> 02:53:13.840]  writes letter opposing low income housing development next to his mansion all good liberal
[02:53:13.840 --> 02:53:19.760]  democrat steve curry doesn't want the lonely peons and the peasants and the serfs outside of his
[02:53:19.760 --> 02:53:25.760]  house he's not for that oh poor little staff poor little steve curry well must be tough
[02:53:27.520 --> 02:53:31.600]  poor him and now he's asking the government now to build him a wall so that he doesn't
[02:53:31.600 --> 02:53:39.040]  have to see the peasants too that's nice that's good now this is just wild stuff talk about being
[02:53:39.040 --> 02:53:45.200]  ungrateful so there's a video of a tunisian group who goes to underdeveloped parts of africa
[02:53:46.080 --> 02:53:52.560]  and brings them some semblance of an infrastructure so they can get water and of course leave it to
[02:53:52.560 --> 02:53:56.400]  liberals to complain now here's the amazing thing about this video if you look in the background
[02:53:56.400 --> 02:54:03.840]  guy just give me the b-roll here of clip three if you look at the background here you'll see
[02:54:03.840 --> 02:54:09.840]  that the adults who are who are seeing this young black child get water get his face washed and and
[02:54:09.840 --> 02:54:14.880]  get and get water out of the hands and you see look at their smiles guys look at how happy they are

[03:00:00.800 --> 03:00:04.400]  all right the great maria z is about to take over quickly though i've been
[03:00:04.400 --> 03:00:08.640]  teasing this video and so i want to play it now jordan tristan walker helped write the
[03:00:08.640 --> 03:00:12.560]  boston consulting group white paper that recommended remdesivir only a few days
[03:00:12.560 --> 03:00:19.040]  days after fda emergency approval for the full story of rebecca go to marc kulak's youtube
[03:00:19.040 --> 03:00:24.640]  channel heusatonic live again i'm sorry if i'm mispronouncing the name or the name of the show
[03:00:24.640 --> 03:00:28.640]  i'm just not familiar with it but that's uh what george webb is reporting and without
[03:00:28.640 --> 03:00:35.200]  further ado here's the video of them talking about it uh what i've been teasing and then maria z
[03:00:35.200 --> 03:00:41.120]  takes over i'll take back my stuff so now they said no no no she can't wear her pajamas she has
[03:00:41.120 --> 03:00:48.080]  to put on you know icu clothes gong you know pompers and daniel did not like that what was
[03:00:48.080 --> 03:00:55.520]  the justification for having to use a bedpan you don't mind my asking i mean it's not like she had
[03:00:55.520 --> 03:01:00.960]  a broken leg no there was no justification but apparently the remdesivir was filling up the
[03:01:00.960 --> 03:01:10.400]  lungs with fluid so they had to keep her on high flow oxygen this is what i'm finding out after
[03:01:10.400 --> 03:01:17.600]  the fact so you found out after the fact that one of the side effects of course is the lungs
[03:01:17.600 --> 03:01:22.720]  to fill up with fluid the very drop that's supposed to help the lungs drain the fluid
[03:01:22.720 --> 03:01:27.200]  they didn't give her they give her the one that fills up with fluid because it attacks the kidneys
[03:01:27.200 --> 03:01:31.600]  and the kidneys can no longer get rid of get rid of the fluid that's the first thing that's the
[03:01:31.600 --> 03:01:37.920]  that's the it's not a side effect of remdesivir it's the effect of using remdesivir is that it
[03:01:37.920 --> 03:01:43.520]  shuts down your kidneys so it can't pump out fluid anymore so it will build up in the lungs
[03:01:43.520 --> 03:01:48.400]  and they they know this so that's why they do it and then they can say you know now we have to
[03:01:48.400 --> 03:01:54.160]  vent you because you have too much fluid and you're not breathing correct so now on tuesday
[03:01:54.160 --> 03:02:00.640]  dr ramanu said to me oh i think we're gonna need to put on a vent and i'm like no no no you're
[03:02:00.640 --> 03:02:06.640]  not doing that i said no no you're not doing that no tuesday this is tuesday now this is tuesday
[03:02:06.640 --> 03:02:13.520]  now yeah he got me into the icu on monday so on tuesday now he's telling me daniel needs to go on
[03:02:13.520 --> 03:02:20.000]  the ventilator to help her to breathe and it would only be for a short time this is a dr ramp
[03:02:20.000 --> 03:02:27.920]  ramanu ramanu farid or something ramanu and i've been sick because this is four nights i'm not sleeping
[03:02:27.920 --> 03:02:34.240]  five nights that were they asking you to leave no no they knew i had to but they keep telling me oh
[03:02:34.240 --> 03:02:38.880]  you know you're so lucky nobody else gets to be here with their loved ones nobody gets to be here
[03:02:38.880 --> 03:02:47.440]  it's all lucky oftentimes uh all the family is one way or another encouraged to leave
[03:02:48.240 --> 03:02:54.720]  waking the uh the the victim or patient more vulnerable yeah well that's what they did to me
[03:02:54.720 --> 03:02:59.520]  on wednesday morning she didn't sleep at all Tuesday night and i was getting really sick
[03:02:59.520 --> 03:03:09.760]  so i asked the nurse ivan that's a nurse i said could i please go home shower and come back
[03:03:10.480 --> 03:03:16.560]  and he says yes you could do that i'm like okay so now she's asleep it's like six in the morning
[03:03:16.560 --> 03:03:23.200]  i said okay i'll sneak out i'll shower get some food get some clothes and come back in so i left
[03:03:23.200 --> 03:03:31.200]  i call my husband he picked me up an hour later they called and they said no was about eight o'clock
[03:03:32.000 --> 03:03:37.600]  they called me and they said i cannot come back to the hospital unless i have a covid negative test
[03:03:42.080 --> 03:03:48.960]  so they lied to me and this was obviously that was not known when you left that no you may not
[03:03:48.960 --> 03:03:55.680]  be able to re-enter no i wouldn't never left my child i would have i just wanted to shower it's
[03:03:55.680 --> 03:04:01.440]  five days i just want to shower just just to help myself with you know everything she was really sick
[03:04:01.440 --> 03:04:06.720]  though me because i was talking around the phone she was really bad i was i started now getting
[03:04:06.720 --> 03:04:12.320]  concerned for my wife so i was kind of like begging her you you've got it you've got to come home
[03:04:12.320 --> 03:04:17.440]  you've got to get out of there we got to we have to take care of you and then i was getting sick
[03:04:17.440 --> 03:04:23.280]  not as bad as she was or i don't know maybe it was similar yeah so my only intention was just go
[03:04:23.280 --> 03:04:29.680]  home take a hot shower get some more medicine and and come back to the hospital and when they told me
[03:04:29.680 --> 03:04:35.760]  that my heart just sunk i just i didn't know what to do at that point because not only they told me
[03:04:35.760 --> 03:04:40.960]  i couldn't come back they said if i came on the property i would be removed your police would
[03:04:40.960 --> 03:04:48.240]  review it yeah this is this is Wednesday morning this okay so so wednesday morning is

[03:06:13.040 --> 03:06:18.240]  i am reporting to you from the testing ground of the new world order in australia and let me tell
[03:06:18.240 --> 03:06:23.440]  you something there are very very few government officials that represent the people left in the
[03:06:23.440 --> 03:06:28.320]  world you could probably count them on one hand in australia we've been extremely fortunate
[03:06:28.320 --> 03:06:35.440]  to have three that have been extremely vocal the entire time of course there are others but these
[03:06:35.440 --> 03:06:40.720]  three are standouts and one of those is senator malcolm roberts he's been speaking out against
[03:06:40.720 --> 03:06:47.360]  the united nations against the global corporate takeover for years and he joins us now and i
[03:06:47.360 --> 03:06:52.000]  really really want any government officials in the united states or anywhere in the world to pay
[03:06:52.000 --> 03:06:57.920]  attention because this is what someone that serves the people behaves like this is what someone who
[03:06:57.920 --> 03:07:03.120]  understands that they are actually serving the public not themselves not the globalist puppet
[03:07:03.120 --> 03:07:09.440]  masters the people actually behaves like he's been very outspoken and hopefully the team have him
[03:07:09.440 --> 03:07:17.920]  online now senator malcolm roberts it's wonderful to see you same here maria it's wonderful indeed
[03:07:17.920 --> 03:07:23.680]  and congratulations on the work you're doing it really is amazing thank you senator malcolm i
[03:07:23.680 --> 03:07:28.960]  really really appreciate that now senator roberts we have so much to talk about today i want to
[03:07:28.960 --> 03:07:35.280]  really you know oh and just played a video of a mother that suffered the loss of her child due
[03:07:35.280 --> 03:07:42.400]  to hospital protocols with COVID-19 you know we've got the Pfizer expose that's just come out
[03:07:42.400 --> 03:07:50.640]  and just yesterday on 2GB ben Fordham spoke about the Pfizer expose which is huge news in Australia
[03:07:50.640 --> 03:07:57.520]  it's made the mainstream and you know of course today we've got articles talking about how you
[03:07:57.520 --> 03:08:03.040]  know project veritas in the past has you know been fact-checked to be incorrect and all of this
[03:08:03.040 --> 03:08:08.640]  but the fact remains that we have a Pfizer employee on camera admitting that they're doing what they
[03:08:08.640 --> 03:08:14.240]  call directed evolution uh we're trusting that you're going to speak up honestly about this senator
[03:08:14.240 --> 03:08:19.840]  roberts i'll give you the floor well thank you very much maria it's really important to understand
[03:08:19.840 --> 03:08:26.240]  one thing up front this has never been about health never been about health and that's why it's been so
[03:08:26.240 --> 03:08:33.200]  grossly and incompetently mismanaged it has always been about control control of the people
[03:08:33.200 --> 03:08:37.680]  that's what we're talking about the second thing it's been about it's been about money transfer
[03:08:37.680 --> 03:08:43.760]  wealth transfer from the people of Australia people around the world to big to big pharma
[03:08:43.760 --> 03:08:50.000]  Pfizer included that's what it's been about and it's been about testing procedures to get control
[03:08:50.000 --> 03:08:54.880]  over people we've seen many of those we've seen the the what some people call the vaccine
[03:08:54.880 --> 03:08:58.720]  passports i call them digital prisons because that's what they're really doing they're saying
[03:08:58.720 --> 03:09:03.360]  you cannot go into society unless you do these things that the government dictates now what we've
[03:09:03.360 --> 03:09:10.160]  got uh i just saw it yesterday the day before is government preparing legislation to give the
[03:09:10.160 --> 03:09:18.080]  Australian uh communication and media uh authority the power to regulate on disinformation and
[03:09:18.080 --> 03:09:24.000]  misinformation we all know that the major disinformers and misinformers were government
[03:09:24.000 --> 03:09:30.720]  agencies opera tga chief medical officer department of health at targi these people
[03:09:30.720 --> 03:09:36.320]  all just like their counterparts in the united states are the ones who promoted this disinformation
[03:09:36.320 --> 03:09:41.440]  and misinformation what we're seeing here is an example of control because what they want to do
[03:09:41.440 --> 03:09:46.960]  maria with this disinformation and misinformation regulation is shut down not big tech but shut
[03:09:46.960 --> 03:09:53.600]  down you and me and every citizen in this country from telling the truth you know and and we've
[03:09:53.600 --> 03:09:59.360]  just seen so many heinous things this this is this is not this is not unusual this has not
[03:09:59.360 --> 03:10:03.840]  been started in the last three years this has been built up in a very integrated way this has
[03:10:03.840 --> 03:10:09.760]  been locked in place in an integrated way through many departments for about two decades they've
[03:10:09.760 --> 03:10:14.560]  been preparing they've been preparing for this and and there's nothing new in that because
[03:10:14.560 --> 03:10:20.240]  marie strong is the granddaddy of uh or was he died in 2015 he was the granddaddy he was the
[03:10:20.240 --> 03:10:26.960]  fabricator of the claims that global warming exists it doesn't and that it's due to human
[03:10:26.960 --> 03:10:33.680]  production of carbon dioxide he fabricated that he's a he's a crook he died in uh after returning
[03:10:33.680 --> 03:10:39.280]  from exile in china where he went because american law enforcement authorities were after him he did
[03:10:39.280 --> 03:10:44.960]  some crimes in western united states he was wanted for un food for oil program scandal and other
[03:10:44.960 --> 03:10:50.560]  scandals within the un he concocted the chicago climate exchange which was which was to trade
[03:10:50.560 --> 03:10:55.520]  carbon dioxide credits the man sought to make billions from carbon dioxide credits along with
[03:10:55.520 --> 03:11:02.160]  his mates al gore he had two aims in in his in his life one was to create an unelected socialist
[03:11:02.160 --> 03:11:06.800]  global governance which we're seeing uh parts of through the world economic forum and new
[03:11:06.800 --> 03:11:12.080]  and alliance pushing the same agenda uh they they formed an alliance in 2018 they're working
[03:11:12.080 --> 03:11:16.640]  together they've always been working for the globalist predators and the second aim was to
[03:11:16.640 --> 03:11:23.120]  deindustrialize western society deindustrialize western civilization i mean this man is in was in
[03:11:23.120 --> 03:11:29.280]  human but highly highly capable very intelligent and extremely good networker that's illustrative
[03:11:29.280 --> 03:11:35.120]  of what the un does and it illustrates what we're what we're doing in our countries around the west
[03:11:35.120 --> 03:11:42.480]  we are building policies based upon crooks and lies crooks are driving our policy in our country
[03:11:42.480 --> 03:11:47.920]  including the uh the policies on covered and health and now we want the united nations world
[03:11:47.920 --> 03:11:52.240]  health organization to come up with a treaty well we don't want it but that's what they want
[03:11:52.240 --> 03:11:59.520]  they want a treaty to regulate every single person in every single country we'd lose our sovereignty
[03:11:59.520 --> 03:12:05.200]  lose our governance and you hand it over to the crooked corrupt incompetent dishonest vile in
[03:12:05.200 --> 03:12:11.440]  human united nations well we have reported i mean i've i've had uh james rugusky on the
[03:12:11.440 --> 03:12:15.200]  alex jones show with me previously talking about the international health regulations
[03:12:15.200 --> 03:12:20.160]  amendments i want to maybe we'll start on that before we go to break uh coming up soon but the
[03:12:20.160 --> 03:12:26.000]  the international health regulations are a little bit different to the pandemic treaty the pandemic
[03:12:26.000 --> 03:12:30.320]  treaty is one where government officials would have to vote the amendments to the international
[03:12:30.320 --> 03:12:36.000]  health regulations are being negotiated without your consult without consulting someone like you
[03:12:36.000 --> 03:12:41.840]  who's a senator an australian senator and the same would be for any other government representatives
[03:12:41.840 --> 03:12:47.920]  anywhere else in the world you don't have a say so how do the people have a say exactly and what's
[03:12:47.920 --> 03:12:55.920]  worse it it failed uh 12 months ago around about 12 months ago uh in 2022 um the world health
[03:12:55.920 --> 03:13:01.520]  organization lost the votes of the african nations now as we know african nations are fairly small
[03:13:01.520 --> 03:13:07.120]  some of them are large in population but they're many in number and so they have votes across
[03:13:07.120 --> 03:13:11.200]  across the african continent whereas the united states for example has only one vote australia
[03:13:11.200 --> 03:13:16.960]  has only one vote what they did was the african said we've had enough of the way you treat us
[03:13:16.960 --> 03:13:22.320]  in africa uh with with some of your drugs you've killed thousands of africans so the africans
[03:13:22.320 --> 03:13:28.400]  voted against it now what they're doing is talking about bribing the africans by giving them money
[03:13:28.400 --> 03:13:33.920]  giving them free drugs as if that's it and that's an incentive but what we need to do is to make
[03:13:33.920 --> 03:13:38.800]  sure and that's how they want to get these latest regulations through by bribing the africans to
[03:13:38.800 --> 03:13:45.440]  get that african vote maria they destroyed our health system the united nations set at the start
[03:13:45.440 --> 03:13:52.080]  of the covid virus outbreak it's not a pandemic it's an outbreak that um that it was not transferable
[03:13:52.080 --> 03:13:56.560]  from humans to humans that was a lie then they told us it was under control in china that was
[03:13:56.560 --> 03:14:02.240]  a lie then they told us it was severe that was a lie it is not severe other than the people with
[03:14:02.240 --> 03:14:08.000]  comorbidities but they have destroyed our health system they've done the exact opposite of what we
[03:14:08.000 --> 03:14:13.280]  need for creating healthy population they have caused obesity they've caused deficiencies of
[03:14:13.280 --> 03:14:18.960]  vitamin d they've caused mental health problems they've caused removal of a proven safe effective
[03:14:18.960 --> 03:14:23.920]  affordable accessible treatment ivermectin and hydroxychloroquine never before in australia's
[03:14:23.920 --> 03:14:30.240]  history have we had a proven safe effective drug taken away from people and people in this state
[03:14:30.240 --> 03:14:36.400]  of queensland threatened with jail if they prescribe hydroxychloroquine this is inhuman
[03:14:36.400 --> 03:14:42.160]  and then they have forced a shot on on people that has proven to become to be toxic it has never
[03:14:42.160 --> 03:14:48.240]  been safe never been effective they've destroyed our health system and people's basic health through
[03:14:48.240 --> 03:14:54.640]  lockdowns uh and through now injecting people under coercion i mean how how inhuman is it
[03:14:54.640 --> 03:15:00.560]  when when people are given a choice either get an injection and feed your child or your child
[03:15:00.560 --> 03:15:05.760]  starts because you lose your job that's terrible and now they want to give these same people control
[03:15:05.760 --> 03:15:10.720]  of our health over our individual health and give them the opportunity to give mandates over us
[03:15:10.720 --> 03:15:17.760]  come on but you're right it's gonna be more than that people but but the last time was the test
[03:15:17.760 --> 03:15:22.640]  run the correct passports travel and we'll get into that on the other side of the break which
[03:15:22.640 --> 03:15:29.520]  we're going to in a moment but there the the last test run of how far they can push their control
[03:15:29.520 --> 03:15:37.120]  is just a baby step of what they actually want to achieve and let me just say to the u.s audience
[03:15:37.120 --> 03:15:42.080]  do you see how rare it is having a representative in the government like senator roberts is here
[03:15:42.080 --> 03:15:47.680]  with us right now that is so upfront about this so honest i watch american tv i watch american news
[03:15:47.680 --> 03:15:51.680]  and you don't have that uh representatives that are this honest we'll be back with senator roberts
[03:15:51.680 --> 03:16:00.960]  right after this break they want the planet for themselves my friends if we're so stupid we let
[03:16:00.960 --> 03:16:14.320]  them kill us we deserve it except the children don't deserve it do they and i looked and behold
[03:16:16.480 --> 03:16:25.120]  a pale horse and he that sat on the horse was named death
[03:16:25.120 --> 03:16:33.680]  another translation is i looked and behold a pale horse
[03:16:35.520 --> 03:16:41.600]  and his name that sat on him was death and hell followed with him a book of revelation
[03:16:43.520 --> 03:16:47.600]  very serious times to be alive folks they're not just doing this is one off this is the beginning
[03:16:47.600 --> 03:16:52.160]  of the rest of our lives this is our fight and i'm proud of humanity the globalists even admit
[03:16:52.160 --> 03:16:56.080]  it's leaked they're very upset that they're losing and and that this hasn't gone the way they thought

[03:20:12.640 --> 03:20:17.840]  Welcome back to the alex jones show we're here in a historic moment an australian senator
[03:20:17.840 --> 03:20:24.160]  is joining us to tell the people the truth about the globalist agenda that he has been so courageous
[03:20:24.160 --> 03:20:30.480]  in fighting senator malkin robits i want leaders all over the world for everyone who's watching
[03:20:30.480 --> 03:20:36.880]  all the info warriors out there send this to your elected or unelected officials and demand
[03:20:36.880 --> 03:20:42.000]  that they speak this openly about the agenda demand that they give you the honesty that we're
[03:20:42.000 --> 03:20:46.640]  getting right now from senator robits before the break we were talking about the possibilities of the
[03:20:46.640 --> 03:20:51.280]  ihr amendments and what it would actually spell what what measures it would actually spell senator
[03:20:51.280 --> 03:20:56.880]  robits please talk us through that worst case scenario so that other people can listen to
[03:20:56.880 --> 03:21:02.560]  your example and start fighting back against this well the united nations worst case would define
[03:21:02.560 --> 03:21:08.320]  what is what is a threat and a health system to australians and then put in measures to manage
[03:21:08.320 --> 03:21:14.320]  that or to control that and they're all about control of individuals but you know maria the
[03:21:14.320 --> 03:21:20.320]  details haven't been resolved on that but they're we we're very encouraged by a couple of things that
[03:21:20.320 --> 03:21:24.960]  have happened in this country first of all the previous government the liberal government tried
[03:21:24.960 --> 03:21:30.320]  to put in place a cash ban a ban of cash and that is fundamental to getting control through
[03:21:30.960 --> 03:21:36.160]  central bank digital currencies they introduced that into the lower house the house of representatives
[03:21:36.160 --> 03:21:42.800]  the labor party swallowed the bait and passed it they both combined to pass the this this
[03:21:42.800 --> 03:21:50.240]  heinous bill we got hold of it in the senate and my office communicated with other cross bench
[03:21:50.240 --> 03:21:56.160]  senators and then other senators and and we got it stopped in the in the senate we put on so much
[03:21:56.160 --> 03:22:01.680]  pressure by connecting with the grassroots of the labor party and the grassroots of the liberal
[03:22:01.680 --> 03:22:08.080]  party we did their job for them and we drove so much so much opposition within those parties
[03:22:08.080 --> 03:22:16.160]  that both parties consigned the the bill to the senate inquiry and then it was just uh it just
[03:22:16.160 --> 03:22:24.560]  linked it limbered there in lingo and we then we then sorry i've forgotten that term but it just
[03:22:24.560 --> 03:22:30.080]  it just withered there and we moved the motion then to ban it from the to take it off the senate
[03:22:30.080 --> 03:22:36.080]  notice paper so what happened what i'm telling you is that these things are heinous but they
[03:22:36.080 --> 03:22:41.920]  can be beaten they can be beaten but it needs the people to be awoken and to get get stuck into
[03:22:41.920 --> 03:22:47.040]  their representatives exactly as you said it's very important to understand that the un has never
[03:22:47.040 --> 03:22:54.560]  been elected senior people in the united nations have not been elected they're unelected bureaucrats
[03:22:54.560 --> 03:23:00.560]  with no authority no jurisdiction over our countries that they're given that power over
[03:23:00.560 --> 03:23:06.960]  our countries by senior bureaucrats and senior politicians in our countries who cede that or
[03:23:06.960 --> 03:23:12.560]  who write legislation enabling the un to take control that's ultimately what happens with the
[03:23:12.560 --> 03:23:19.600]  united nations they take control we push they they push our policies on them our dopey bureaucrats
[03:23:19.600 --> 03:23:24.640]  our dopey politicians who are supposed to be leading our governments then bypass the people
[03:23:24.640 --> 03:23:30.240]  without ever talking about it and pass legislation through the parliament so that's the the fundamental
[03:23:30.240 --> 03:23:34.400]  thing that's that's a that's the worst that the united nations can do they can control
[03:23:34.400 --> 03:23:40.320]  individuals with these regulations but what we need we need to understand that the people have the
[03:23:40.320 --> 03:23:46.720]  power in a democracy well let's start again in a totalitarian dictatorship the government
[03:23:46.720 --> 03:23:52.080]  is it controls the people and the people are afraid of the government in a democracy the
[03:23:52.080 --> 03:23:57.040]  government operates only with the consent of the governed they govern only with the consent of the
[03:23:57.040 --> 03:24:03.600]  governed that's fundamental to and understand that and that means that the people run the show
[03:24:03.600 --> 03:24:09.600]  the people elect or not elect various officials so the people need to stand up put pressure on
[03:24:09.600 --> 03:24:15.840]  their officials stand up at the ballot box and vote for people who will look after after their
[03:24:15.840 --> 03:24:22.160]  interests and the country's interests in a democracy the government is afraid of the people
[03:24:22.160 --> 03:24:26.880]  because the government gets changed if it doesn't do a job we are living under totalitarian
[03:24:26.880 --> 03:24:31.840]  dictatorships through massive media manipulation through the mouthpiece media which is owned by
[03:24:31.840 --> 03:24:37.760]  the same globalist predators who own big Pfizer and and the other control entities same with the
[03:24:37.760 --> 03:24:42.160]  subsidies they're going to billionaires for for climate change that is the subsidies for for
[03:24:42.160 --> 03:24:48.240]  putting in place the destruction of our energy system that's going to billionaires and and
[03:24:48.240 --> 03:24:53.680]  large corporations overseas predominantly so what we've seen is a takeover of our country
[03:24:53.680 --> 03:24:59.520]  but it's not due to the UN the UN just just provides the fodder it is due to due to our
[03:24:59.520 --> 03:25:06.240]  elected and unelected officials as you pointed out just betraying treasonously betraying our
[03:25:06.240 --> 03:25:11.680]  country you know when I when I had my first speech in the parliament I started with the words
[03:25:11.680 --> 03:25:19.120]  as a servant to the people of Queensland my state and Australia people in the Labor Party laughed
[03:25:20.320 --> 03:25:25.920]  people in the Liberal Party sniggered I've done it every speech since then apart from the one or
[03:25:25.920 --> 03:25:30.400]  two minute speeches where there's not enough time but every major speech three minutes longer I say
[03:25:30.400 --> 03:25:35.920]  I start with as a servant to the people of Queensland Australia I am here to serve the
[03:25:35.920 --> 03:25:41.280]  people who pay my salary that is fundamental in a democracy and that's what we've got to get back
[03:25:41.280 --> 03:25:46.000]  to and it starts with the people standing up and holding their members of parliament accountable
[03:25:46.000 --> 03:25:51.280]  the members of Congress accountable fundamental and and here's what it is this is why these
[03:25:51.280 --> 03:25:55.760]  conversations are so crucial because number one and this broadcast is so crucial number one the
[03:25:55.760 --> 03:26:01.600]  people have to know what the what is going on in order to demand action from their elected or
[03:26:01.600 --> 03:26:06.960]  unelected officials in Australia right now we have a huge action at stopthewho.com and and
[03:26:06.960 --> 03:26:11.920]  the same is happening in the United States I've spoken about it on this broadcast for people
[03:26:11.920 --> 03:26:17.920]  to take action and put pressure on their politicians this is one thing that can be done then phone
[03:26:17.920 --> 03:26:23.520]  calls then visits then the people must become more active right now because we really are in a race
[03:26:23.520 --> 03:26:29.120]  Senator Roberts they're telling us another pandemic is coming another pandemic is coming
[03:26:29.120 --> 03:26:36.560]  and according to what the WHO is trying to do next time the the control we experience during
[03:26:36.560 --> 03:26:47.280]  COVID will look like child's play that's correct if you if you look at this COVID virus it's not a
[03:26:47.280 --> 03:26:53.600]  pandemic COVID virus it's certainly not a deadly pandemic there's been no country on earth that
[03:26:53.600 --> 03:26:58.880]  has had a an increase in deaths above normal not one country Sweden had a slight increase
[03:26:58.880 --> 03:27:05.440]  which was pulling forward of deaths from flu etc but then they quickly leveled out not one country
[03:27:05.440 --> 03:27:11.040]  has had excess deaths to indicate and you can't have a deadly pandemic without excess deaths
[03:27:11.040 --> 03:27:17.840]  that's it so the the we we asked in in the parliament on the very first single day session
[03:27:17.840 --> 03:27:24.320]  where we had an emergency session so-called you know we we asked for the information on the virus
[03:27:25.120 --> 03:27:31.440]  I then wrote letters to the prime minister to the premier of my state did not get any evidence
[03:27:32.240 --> 03:27:36.720]  12 months went by I asked the chief medical officer for the evidence he gave me the evidence
[03:27:36.720 --> 03:27:42.800]  the evidence that he showed us both numerical and relative showed that the and he classified it
[03:27:42.800 --> 03:27:48.720]  this is not me this is the chief medical officer classifying the COVID virus it was low to moderate
[03:27:48.720 --> 03:27:54.720]  in severity not not high severity low to moderate in severity and then if you think about the the
[03:27:54.720 --> 03:28:02.480]  fact the fact that it selectively targets people that only a few people get get die or get severe
[03:28:02.480 --> 03:28:07.680]  consequences from COVID they're the aged the people with comorbidities the obese people who
[03:28:07.680 --> 03:28:13.840]  are vulnerable then you realize that it's not very severe at all and then you also realize
[03:28:13.840 --> 03:28:21.600]  that the deaths from from uh from sorry from from the strength that the severity of COVID
[03:28:21.600 --> 03:28:28.400]  is less than some past flu's chief medical officer's own diagram shows that and then we look at the
[03:28:28.400 --> 03:28:34.240]  deaths senator Roberts we're about to go we're we're about to go to a break uh this is so important
[03:28:34.240 --> 03:28:41.520]  because it shows what you're talking about exposes the fact that all of the measures that were in

[03:33:12.160 --> 03:33:17.120]  all right so right before the break senator mouth and roberts was talking to us about the fact
[03:33:17.120 --> 03:33:23.920]  that covid was never very dangerous uh and and you know they were really they they even rated it
[03:33:23.920 --> 03:33:30.960]  as low to moderate risk now what we have is the results of the measures that they put in place
[03:33:31.520 --> 03:33:37.920]  the consequences of those measures senator roberts you were very very outspoken against the vaccines
[03:33:37.920 --> 03:33:43.760]  injections uh you you spoke about the dangers early on because of the fact that you could see
[03:33:43.760 --> 03:33:50.640]  through this uh and you're not bought and and paid out for uh like the others but you you spoke
[03:33:50.640 --> 03:33:55.280]  about the dangers we warned about it we tried to get the information out to australians and now
[03:33:55.280 --> 03:33:59.760]  we're seeing excess deaths not only in australia but all over the world numbers ranging anywhere
[03:33:59.760 --> 03:34:05.840]  from 15 to 30 percent in excess deaths it is climbing uh talk to us about the excess deaths in
[03:34:05.840 --> 03:34:10.240]  australia i know that another senator one of your colleagues has really been hammering out
[03:34:10.240 --> 03:34:18.880]  therapeutic goods administration for answers yes the the excess deaths um they're being suppressed
[03:34:18.880 --> 03:34:26.720]  we've seen the tga for example around about it in australia a doctor certifies that someone has died
[03:34:26.720 --> 03:34:34.720]  a doctor certifies death so doctor makes that decision we've had despite the amazing censorship
[03:34:34.720 --> 03:34:41.760]  the hideous inhuman censorship and the suppression of doctors we've had a almost a thousand reported
[03:34:41.760 --> 03:34:49.520]  deaths due to the covid injections almost a thousand they are not vaccines they are experimental
[03:34:50.160 --> 03:34:58.080]  untested gene therapy based treatment a thousand deaths close to a thousand we've had the tga
[03:34:58.080 --> 03:35:06.000]  revised that downwards with with some process that's not given objective guidelines and they
[03:35:06.000 --> 03:35:13.840]  revise that down to 14 even 14 deaths is enough to recall that have you had philip altman on
[03:35:13.840 --> 03:35:20.560]  dr philip altman on your program maria yes of course of course but we also have a cdc now
[03:35:20.560 --> 03:35:26.800]  we have the cdc senator robert's talking about the fact that they did over report
[03:35:26.800 --> 03:35:31.600]  covert deaths so we know that they were doing that the numbers are completely skewed regardless
[03:35:31.600 --> 03:35:37.120]  so what will if they over reported covert deaths supposed covert deaths of course they're under
[03:35:37.120 --> 03:35:42.720]  reporting vaccine death right so let's let's have a look at the actual statistics from the
[03:35:42.720 --> 03:35:47.600]  australian government's body the australian bureau statistics okay and this was published
[03:35:47.600 --> 03:35:53.840]  these were published in part as a result of a one nation my party's document discovery uh in in late
[03:35:53.840 --> 03:36:02.720]  last year in 2019 the year before covert the seasonal flu cost 4126 lives the next year
[03:36:02.720 --> 03:36:10.080]  in 2020 the first year of the virus in australia australia recorded 882 deaths from covert largely
[03:36:10.080 --> 03:36:17.840]  due to an infection in an old people's home an aged care facility and 2287 deaths from the
[03:36:17.840 --> 03:36:26.080]  flu for a total of 3169 deaths that is almost 1000 deaths less than the flu alone killed the
[03:36:26.080 --> 03:36:33.840]  previous year almost so we had about three quarters of the deaths of the previous year then in 2021
[03:36:33.840 --> 03:36:41.120]  1137 deaths from covert were recorded and 2073 deaths recorded from the flu for a total of
[03:36:41.120 --> 03:36:50.560]  3200 again almost three quarters of the figure for flu alone in 2019 that means the deaths from
[03:36:50.560 --> 03:36:56.320]  the flu including covert across the first two years of the virus in this country were right on
[03:36:56.320 --> 03:37:02.560]  the long-term average of 3255 there was nothing unusual about the death rate due to covert in
[03:37:02.560 --> 03:37:09.120]  2020 or 2021 and yet as you point out the only thing unusual about the death rate in 2021
[03:37:09.120 --> 03:37:14.640]  was it is a seven-year low but what you what you also make what you also alluded to was that
[03:37:14.640 --> 03:37:20.400]  within months of the covert injections being given out we started seeing an increase in all
[03:37:20.400 --> 03:37:28.160]  cause mortality heart heart problems mycoditis pericarditis blood clots many many diseases
[03:37:28.160 --> 03:37:33.440]  recurrences of cancer and we know these are due to the to the vaccines and you would know
[03:37:33.440 --> 03:37:39.360]  that to the injections rather than off vaccines so some people then say well hang on hang on
[03:37:39.360 --> 03:37:44.720]  I had the shot but I didn't by the way I will never get that shot but some people say they had
[03:37:44.720 --> 03:37:54.240]  the shot and they've got no no adverse effects Altman's paper written with Wendy Hoy who's a
[03:37:54.240 --> 03:38:00.480]  leading academic and a medico in this country and five other medical medical practitioners
[03:38:00.480 --> 03:38:09.600]  shows why the CDC the FDA did not control the development of these injections they were
[03:38:09.600 --> 03:38:14.640]  controlled by the Department of Defense with wrote contracts for Pfizer and other manufacturers
[03:38:14.640 --> 03:38:22.240]  and they worked on countermeasures countermeasures not vaccines countermeasures they bypassed the
[03:38:22.240 --> 03:38:28.240]  normal testing so that the vaccine the injections have barely been tested they've not been tested
[03:38:28.240 --> 03:38:33.120]  at all in many many categories they've not been tested on pregnant women they've not been tested
[03:38:33.120 --> 03:38:38.400]  for the gene effects they've not been tested for carcinogenics they have bypassed good
[03:38:38.400 --> 03:38:44.240]  manufacturing processes so what we've got is instead of having a very consistent recipe
[03:38:44.240 --> 03:38:48.560]  or very consistent formulation of of these injections they're all over the place some
[03:38:48.560 --> 03:38:54.480]  injections will kill you others have no effect whatsoever so that explains it all that explains
[03:38:54.480 --> 03:39:02.240]  why only some batches heal people and then we've learned that Pfizer had strict instructions to
[03:39:02.240 --> 03:39:07.840]  give certain batches only to their own employees because they knew this they knew a lot of this
[03:39:07.840 --> 03:39:11.120]  what was going on and then we have Pfizer suppressing the truth we have the world health
[03:39:11.120 --> 03:39:16.720]  organization suppressing the truth we have our own medical practitioners in this medical
[03:39:16.720 --> 03:39:22.080]  authorities in this country suppressing truth but our politicians ministers and public servants
[03:39:22.080 --> 03:39:29.920]  were complicit they are complicit in the horrific deaths and we know that the the the deaths from
[03:39:29.920 --> 03:39:34.480]  the injections are not being reported because of the suppression and the misinformation
[03:39:34.480 --> 03:39:40.640]  from opera and and other medical authorities in this country we are under severe threat in this
[03:39:40.640 --> 03:39:47.520]  country we are you're absolutely right and you previously used the words and i know that
[03:39:47.520 --> 03:39:53.040]  info was played this footage at one stage where in in parliament you said this is genocide so
[03:39:53.040 --> 03:40:00.400]  we're dealing with something that is so huge worldwide and if your colleagues don't stand up
[03:40:00.400 --> 03:40:06.480]  and if other government officials don't stand up i mean these people think that what do they think
[03:40:06.480 --> 03:40:10.960]  senator roberts that they're going to somehow join the club or that they're going to escape this
[03:40:10.960 --> 03:40:16.480]  huge control that's coming no one in the country has spoken about digital id as much as you can
[03:40:16.480 --> 03:40:21.120]  you please take the viewers we're about to go to break in a minute but just just start on digital
[03:40:21.120 --> 03:40:26.800]  id and what this actually spells if government officials don't get on board with fighting back
[03:40:26.800 --> 03:40:33.760]  against this right the first thing to understand is in discussing these topics the majority of
[03:40:33.760 --> 03:40:40.320]  parliamentary members senators and house of representatives are ignorant gutless and stupid
[03:40:40.320 --> 03:40:46.960]  when push comes push comes to shove they run away and so it's not a mass not a matter of a
[03:40:46.960 --> 03:40:54.560]  massive conspiracy now people like greg hunt he pushed the the climate narrative he he uh when
[03:40:54.560 --> 03:40:59.680]  he was minister for the environment and climate change right he also was health minister under
[03:40:59.680 --> 03:41:07.200]  under the uh under under the covid mismanagement and so he was also manager for strategy for the
[03:41:07.200 --> 03:41:13.120]  world economic forum 2020 2021 so we've got some people who seem to know what the hell they're doing
[03:41:13.120 --> 03:41:18.080]  but the majority don't that doesn't excuse them because i didn't know what was going on i made
[03:41:18.080 --> 03:41:23.840]  it my business to find out how people accountable but before we go into the into the digital identity
[03:41:23.840 --> 03:41:30.000]  henry kissinger a noted globalist predator responsible for starting wars and killing people
[03:41:30.000 --> 03:41:38.640]  he's still alive he's at 99 he said who controls the food supply controls the people who controls
[03:41:38.640 --> 03:41:45.280]  the energy can control whole continents who controls money can control the world these
[03:41:45.280 --> 03:41:50.960]  globalist predators are starting to control the food supply they are controlling the energy
[03:41:51.520 --> 03:41:56.000]  and they're they definitely control the money through the federal reserve bank and other
[03:41:56.000 --> 03:42:01.920]  entities so just so the people understand this is not me making these accusations this is other
[03:42:01.920 --> 03:42:07.840]  people as part of the global show who are making these revelations the first part of the digital
[03:42:07.840 --> 03:42:16.400]  identity and and is is to get a hold of people's data and then to sell it to corporations that
[03:42:16.400 --> 03:42:21.360]  those corporations can store that data overseas so that that means they don't have to comply
[03:42:21.360 --> 03:42:28.400]  with our data can data privacy recommend data privacy regulations and then for us to get
[03:42:28.400 --> 03:42:34.640]  access to our data we have to pay for it so for example maria your health data can be sold by the
[03:42:34.640 --> 03:42:40.320]  come back we'll come back right after the break with the example i really want people to understand
[03:42:40.320 --> 03:42:48.480]  from you on this topic before we we finish up for for today it's so important that people get this
[03:42:48.480 --> 03:42:53.840]  and put pressure on their officials we'll be right back stay with us a historic moment australia

[03:47:12.080 --> 03:47:21.280]  well we're here with senator mark and robert's i just was looking at telegram over the break
[03:47:21.280 --> 03:47:26.320]  and people in telegram are saying break great broadcast viewing from new york this is the
[03:47:26.320 --> 03:47:31.120]  kind of leadership the template for worldwide and i'd have to agree so senator robert's before the
[03:47:31.120 --> 03:47:35.760]  break we were on to digital id in the next few minutes i just would love for you to really hammer
[03:47:35.760 --> 03:47:42.320]  home the the the whole point of the digital id how it ties in with what they implemented
[03:47:42.320 --> 03:47:48.560]  due to covet what they want to do and and and then we'll um we'll thank you so much for your
[03:47:48.560 --> 03:47:53.680]  time as we always do please go ahead senator robert's okay thank you maria so let's start with
[03:47:53.680 --> 03:47:58.480]  there are three or four fundamental steps first thing is they gather your data they harvest your
[03:47:58.480 --> 03:48:03.920]  data your health data your travel data your financial data your tax data everything about you
[03:48:03.920 --> 03:48:09.520]  what you say on social media these can all be now connected and then they they harvest that
[03:48:09.520 --> 03:48:13.920]  and they sell it to an overseas corporation or an Australian corporation but largely overseas
[03:48:13.920 --> 03:48:19.520]  corporation then the overseas corporation charges you for access to your health data for example
[03:48:20.240 --> 03:48:24.320]  so they get all your data they can understand what you're doing what you're saying
[03:48:24.320 --> 03:48:28.800]  they can control you with that as i'll show you in a minute so there's no security of your on your
[03:48:28.800 --> 03:48:35.760]  data we've already seen that the telling lies to us about saying we need this to protect your
[03:48:35.760 --> 03:48:42.080]  security of your data that is rubbish it is absolute crap because the largest data breaches
[03:48:42.080 --> 03:48:47.920]  come from silicon valley and the government and they're largely due to human failures of systems
[03:48:48.640 --> 03:48:54.000]  so the if if the if the human if the silicon valley can't control the data what chances a
[03:48:54.000 --> 03:49:00.880]  sloppy government got we've already seen a hopeless case there so the second thing they do and this
[03:49:00.880 --> 03:49:06.480]  has been admitted our reserve bank central reserve bank in this country is called the reserve bank
[03:49:06.480 --> 03:49:11.840]  of australia it has admitted to me under questioning in senate estimates where we grill bureaucrats
[03:49:11.840 --> 03:49:16.800]  that they are working on a central bank digital currency they have admitted to me that they're
[03:49:16.800 --> 03:49:25.120]  working in cahoots with a global overseas interest on a global digital currency so that means that
[03:49:25.120 --> 03:49:31.840]  they can then bring in a cashless society now you control government or even corporation corporate
[03:49:31.840 --> 03:49:37.680]  access to data they know everything about you and they can then and then they control the cash
[03:49:37.680 --> 03:49:43.360]  they control the currency because you there's no cash cash is extremely important because with cash
[03:49:43.360 --> 03:49:48.480]  you have an alternative you don't have to go under their control system then what they do that so
[03:49:48.480 --> 03:49:54.000]  that's the second tier is a cashless society then the third one is a social credit system
[03:49:54.800 --> 03:50:00.320]  and that's where they say to you maria well you own an suv therefore you're not going to get a
[03:50:00.320 --> 03:50:05.920]  house loan until you sell that suv you spoke out on the alex jones show therefore you're not going to
[03:50:05.920 --> 03:50:12.880]  get um access to do your normal uh social credit system social credit score so they're going to
[03:50:12.880 --> 03:50:20.640]  control through your cashless through your central bank digital currency your income they control your
[03:50:20.640 --> 03:50:28.240]  life you will bend to their will this is what's happening now this is nothing new in human society
[03:50:28.240 --> 03:50:32.960]  humans throughout it's just throughout history have tried to control others we had people working
[03:50:32.960 --> 03:50:39.360]  out that the best way to to have an easy life was to have slaves we had later on we had feudalism
[03:50:39.360 --> 03:50:45.680]  where where one person the local lord of the manor controlled the resources of production
[03:50:45.680 --> 03:50:53.200]  and controlled the agriculture and gave each each surf just sufficient access to food that he or she
[03:50:53.200 --> 03:51:00.000]  produced and and just to barely keep them alive so this is where we're headed with the world economic
[03:51:00.000 --> 03:51:04.640]  forum in the united nations everyone's heard the term you'll own nothing and be happy you won't
[03:51:04.640 --> 03:51:10.880]  own land you won't uh you won't own anything you'll rent you'll be a partial partial consumer
[03:51:10.880 --> 03:51:15.520]  and they will control your access to energy control your access to money control your
[03:51:15.520 --> 03:51:21.600]  access to food they wanted they want it they've said this and and our government has spent 64
[03:51:21.600 --> 03:51:27.200]  million dollars handed it to the united nations on a food summit for the promotion and the research
[03:51:27.200 --> 03:51:33.680]  of bugs so instead of eating good beef or good sheep or good pork they want us to eat insects
[03:51:33.680 --> 03:51:39.920]  crickets cricket casserole you know this is where these lunatics are going so then we we've seen
[03:51:40.960 --> 03:51:47.200]  my introduction to this i thought all of this was amazingly stupid stuff ridiculous global
[03:51:47.200 --> 03:51:51.680]  conspiracies and all the rest of it then i started researching the climate change and i realized that
[03:51:51.680 --> 03:51:55.680]  was crap then i dug deeper and found it was the united nations then i dug deeper and found the
[03:51:55.680 --> 03:52:00.800]  globalist predators who formed the united nations and use the united nations for controlling people
[03:52:00.800 --> 03:52:05.120]  then i learned more recently about the world economic forum the united nations and the world
[03:52:05.120 --> 03:52:11.520]  economic forum formed an alliance an integrated alliance in 2018 they're now working in cahoots
[03:52:11.520 --> 03:52:18.480]  pushing the the great reset which is simply uh uh their their utopian vision a dystopian vision
[03:52:18.480 --> 03:52:24.960]  actually for stealing your land stealing your property stealing your right to be free they've
[03:52:24.960 --> 03:52:28.960]  already said they've already done some of these things taken away basic freedoms they've taken
[03:52:28.960 --> 03:52:33.840]  away freedom of speech now they're going to be regulating more about misinformation disinformation
[03:52:33.840 --> 03:52:38.400]  when the government is the biggest biggest purveyor of disinformation and misinformation
[03:52:38.400 --> 03:52:44.880]  we've seen phyza i asked questions about this uh phyza has been slapped a few years ago with a
[03:52:44.880 --> 03:52:52.480]  2.4 billion dollar fine for misleading in their marketing of their drugs and i said to the our
[03:52:52.480 --> 03:52:56.640]  equivalent the tga the therapeutic goods administration who control the supposedly big
[03:52:56.640 --> 03:53:01.440]  pharma but who get money from big pharma that's where they get most of their revenue from big
[03:53:01.440 --> 03:53:06.960]  pharma they said oh but senator obitz that was for misrepresenting when i asked them about phyza's
[03:53:07.920 --> 03:53:13.040]  injections for covid injections oh don't worry about the uh don't worry about the the fine
[03:53:13.040 --> 03:53:17.120]  that was just about marketing i said that's the whole fundamental point if they can't tell the
[03:53:17.120 --> 03:53:21.760]  truth in their marketing how can you trust them so that's what we've we've got we've got phyza
[03:53:21.760 --> 03:53:28.160]  i like the recent video senator obitz it's like the recent video with the phyza representative
[03:53:28.160 --> 03:53:34.480]  saying i'm just a liar hang on a minute you're just a director you're you're directing the mr
[03:53:34.480 --> 03:53:40.080]  and a chief sciences and you're just saying on camera i'm just a liar well how can we trust
[03:53:40.080 --> 03:53:45.840]  anything coming out of phyza then when they're very own people and directors talking about mutating
[03:53:45.840 --> 03:53:53.120]  viruses there he is there's his mug i'm just a liar well these are the people representing phyza
[03:53:54.240 --> 03:53:58.480]  yeah we we stayed away from that video because it's very important for us to have credibility and
[03:53:58.480 --> 03:54:03.360]  everything checked we've since learned that it has been independently checked and verified so we
[03:54:03.360 --> 03:54:08.880]  know it's truthful and unlike phyza but if you if you have a look at who owns phyza black rock
[03:54:08.880 --> 03:54:15.120]  vanguard same people own major media companies same people same corporations own major investments in
[03:54:15.120 --> 03:54:20.080]  other entities then we've got bill gates down here this is how our absurd is getting we've got
[03:54:20.080 --> 03:54:25.680]  bill gates down here spending five hours with the prime minister flew down on his massive corporate
[03:54:25.680 --> 03:54:32.400]  jet it's it's an airliner sized jet and and then he had he had discussions with the prime minister on
[03:54:32.400 --> 03:54:41.040]  climate change energy food health he has got no qualifications in any one of those specific areas
[03:54:41.040 --> 03:54:47.600]  not one he has got no experience in those other than distorting the the injections he came out and
[03:54:47.600 --> 03:54:52.880]  he supported the um moderna vaccine the moment he sold his shares in it he was reported as
[03:54:52.880 --> 03:55:00.080]  trashing the the vaccine i mean this guy what kind of human does that and he is lit he's the largest
[03:55:00.080 --> 03:55:05.040]  single contributor behind the united states to the world health organization a crooked corrupt
[03:55:05.040 --> 03:55:10.480]  incompetent dishonest entity so what we've seen is these globalist predators driving the united
[03:55:10.480 --> 03:55:16.000]  nations controlling the world health organization and using them to control us i first learned about
[03:55:16.800 --> 03:55:21.360]  the united nations i thought it was just a benign incompetent body now i realize it's it's far worse
[03:55:21.360 --> 03:55:27.040]  it's it's a criminal body i first learned about it through agenda 21 which is where my climate
[03:55:27.760 --> 03:55:34.000]  climate change research took me to learn about agenda 21 which is real um pauline hansen you
[03:55:34.000 --> 03:55:39.680]  mentioned three of us who do do work that you support in in our parliament pauline hansons the
[03:55:39.680 --> 03:55:47.680]  fourth name i want to add to that she bell the cat she revealed un agenda 21 in 1996 in her first
[03:55:47.680 --> 03:55:54.560]  year in parliament as a young person and and agenda 21 was concocted by the un marie strong again
[03:55:54.560 --> 03:56:00.000]  we opened the show with marie strong um he was a he was a crook and a criminal he concocted agenda
[03:56:00.000 --> 03:56:09.120]  21 to control how we live where we live everything about our lives this has been underway since 1992
[03:56:10.000 --> 03:56:16.400]  1992 senator malcolm we're about to run out of time uh and and and you're right pauline hansen
[03:56:16.400 --> 03:56:23.120]  has done a tremendous job so have you so have uh senator renick senator uh uh alex antik and and
[03:56:23.120 --> 03:56:28.240]  there are others in there and i know according to senator antik he says that more and more people
[03:56:28.240 --> 03:56:33.120]  in parliament are starting to wake up slowly but surely they're seeing that something is wrong
[03:56:33.120 --> 03:56:38.880]  and for that we're very very grateful now i want to say here that you have played such a huge role
[03:56:38.880 --> 03:56:44.320]  in that senator roberts your time here your willingness to come on these broadcasts and and
[03:56:44.320 --> 03:56:49.840]  talk to people who want to tell the truth is absolutely something that stands out in today's
[03:56:49.840 --> 03:56:55.120]  day and age i can count on both my hands maybe the leaders around the world that have been willing
[03:56:55.120 --> 03:56:59.760]  to do that and i said at the start you know we don't have people in the united states uh that
[03:56:59.760 --> 03:57:03.280]  that are willing to tell the truth i'm sure there are some and there are you know people like to
[03:57:03.280 --> 03:57:08.720]  center setting a good example but no one has gone to the lengths that you have so i just really want
[03:57:08.720 --> 03:57:14.000]  to challenge people today send this to your government officials send this to people and say
[03:57:14.000 --> 03:57:19.920]  this is what we expect from you start putting the pressure on them and talk to them in a way
