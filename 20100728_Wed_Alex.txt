[01:27.400 --> 01:32.640]  people for gun confiscation and martial law that is confirmed there is a
[01:32.640 --> 01:38.280]  criminal overthrow of the United States taking place and the system intends to
[01:38.280 --> 01:42.360]  use the military and the police to be the physical enforcers for anybody that
[01:42.360 --> 01:48.440]  doesn't go willingly into the night and allow the globalists to implode this

[02:03.160 --> 02:10.600]  Nemo this morning and he also links to Bloomberg possible false flag attack
[02:10.600 --> 02:16.160]  Japanese say oil tanker attacked near the Strait of Hormuz that's the headline
[02:16.160 --> 02:20.880]  at info wars dot com Bloomberg is reporting this morning that an oil
[02:20.880 --> 02:26.840]  tanker owned by the Japanese company OSK lines operator of one of the world's
[02:26.840 --> 02:30.400]  second largest oil tanker fleets may have been attacked near the Strait of
[02:30.400 --> 02:34.600]  Hormuz is strategically important a waterway between the Gulf of Oman and
[02:34.600 --> 02:41.560]  the Persian Gulf bordering Iran there was an explosion aboard the m star 5 30
[02:41.560 --> 02:48.280]  a.m. Tokyo time that slightly injured one crew member the shipping line said
[02:48.280 --> 02:52.800]  in a statement the ship was on its way to the United Arab Emirates to assess the
[02:52.800 --> 02:58.200]  damage no oil is reported leaking from the vessel thank God the explosion on
[02:58.200 --> 03:01.800]  the starboard side they could have an explosion on board the ship that wouldn't
[03:01.800 --> 03:06.480]  be very suspicious but this is on the side of the ship the explosion on the
[03:06.480 --> 03:10.080]  starboard side of the ship damage hatches in a lifeboat a Corey Baker
[03:10.080 --> 03:15.680]  spokesman for the US fifth fleet speaking iPhone from the fleet's base in
[03:15.680 --> 03:20.280]  Bahrain told Bloomberg they cause an extent of the damages unknown and will
[03:20.280 --> 03:23.600]  be investigated he said if it turns out to be an attack it will have
[03:23.600 --> 03:27.000]  implications for ships going in and out of the Strait of Hormuz and will lead
[03:27.000 --> 03:34.080]  to delays and rising tanker rates said Ben Goggin a freight derivatives broker
[03:34.080 --> 03:39.320]  at the SSY Futures LTD a unit of the world's second largest shipbroker there
[03:39.320 --> 03:44.480]  was a series of naval standoffs between the US and Iran in the Strait of Hormuz
[03:44.480 --> 03:50.240]  in December of 0708 in January of 08 the Pentagon accused Iran of threatening
[03:50.240 --> 03:55.800]  the US fifth fleet but this was later contradicted by the Navy according to
[03:55.800 --> 03:59.880]  press TV a naval officer had literally given the order to fire on Iranian
[03:59.880 --> 04:06.960]  ships and remember what the New Yorker magazine and of course Seymour Hirsch
[04:06.960 --> 04:11.800]  reported and it was later confirmed that White House officials told us I
[04:11.800 --> 04:19.880]  heard that Cheney was having US attack boats gunboats painted up like blue
[04:19.880 --> 04:24.920]  Iranian gunboats and we're going to have Navy SEALs attack US or other ships to
[04:24.920 --> 04:27.880]  be blamed and it turns out right at that same time there were these fake
[04:27.880 --> 04:31.600]  transmissions that turned out they were not from Iran and then later the
[04:31.600 --> 04:35.120]  evidence pointed towards private contractors saying we're going to fire
[04:35.120 --> 04:39.360]  missiles at you in one minute and and then the media said oh Iranian boats
[04:39.360 --> 04:43.200]  we're going to attack this is how they want to start World War 3 with Iran
[04:43.200 --> 04:47.840]  this is Strait of Hormuz event we'll cover this top story and a lot more on

[06:02.880 --> 06:07.200]  solar power generator number one new climate legislation could easily double
[06:07.200 --> 06:11.360]  or triple your electric bill number two our new energies are wants to control
[06:11.360 --> 06:15.440]  how much power your electric company allows you to have it's true total
[06:15.440 --> 06:19.320]  government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is
[06:19.320 --> 06:23.440]  coming number three in some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously
[06:23.440 --> 06:27.760]  overloaded and now new socialist legislation is only compounding the
[06:27.760 --> 06:32.040]  problem number four dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids every
[06:32.040 --> 06:35.760]  year thousands of families lose their power from weather related onages number
[06:35.760 --> 06:39.960]  five a solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of
[06:39.960 --> 06:42.960]  mind folks I really believe in the solar power generators offered by

[08:26.400 --> 08:34.280]  let me get back into today's top story what has Ray McGovern former top CIA
[08:34.280 --> 08:39.720]  analyst Reagan and Bush senior shed on this radio broadcast in the last two
[08:39.720 --> 08:43.760]  years that he believes the number one way they're going to try to start a war
[08:43.760 --> 08:48.240]  with Iran is by staging a straight-up Hormuz event in fact he's been saying
[08:48.240 --> 08:52.560]  that for the last two years at the end of bush in the beginning of Obama he
[08:52.560 --> 08:55.960]  actually started saying in here on this broadcast four years ago and then about a
[08:55.960 --> 08:59.480]  year after he said that that was the intel he was getting it came out in the
[08:59.480 --> 09:04.800]  mainstream news New Yorker magazine MSNBC that Syhurst the Pulitzer Prize
[09:04.800 --> 09:12.360]  winning writer investigative journalist had sources inside the White House that
[09:12.360 --> 09:19.160]  told him that Cheney wanted to paint up fake Iranian patrol boats and have the
[09:19.160 --> 09:23.440]  Navy SEALs attack our ships and then it turned out that right at that very time
[09:23.440 --> 09:28.080]  months after Ray McGovern said this on this show and also wrote about it that
[09:28.080 --> 09:32.880]  they did try to launch a fake attack on our ships by having patrol boats come
[09:32.880 --> 09:37.200]  out and then fake radio broadcasts saying we're going to launch missiles on
[09:37.200 --> 09:42.400]  you in 60 seconds and remember that was all over the news and they showed
[09:42.400 --> 09:46.880]  telephoto video footage of the patrol boats several miles away claiming that
[09:46.880 --> 09:51.440]  they'd transmitted that they were going to do this they want to go to war with
[09:51.440 --> 09:56.280]  Iran Ahmed Denigit of course yesterday said that he has intel that the United
[09:56.280 --> 10:00.320]  States and Israel are planning to strike Iran in the next three months we've got
[10:00.320 --> 10:03.280]  the Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu saying they're getting ready
[10:03.280 --> 10:06.600]  to green light and attack of course two and a half months ago that was the
[10:06.600 --> 10:10.560]  intel from Bilderberg group that they are planning and have now green lighted
[10:10.560 --> 10:16.240]  and attack on Iran they need this to politically get people to rally around
[10:16.240 --> 10:20.160]  the flag when we're attacking another nation and forget about the depression
[10:20.160 --> 10:24.600]  forget about Obama's plunging approval ratings this is one of the false flags
[10:24.600 --> 10:29.200]  that they are definitely developing and now Bloomberg reports this morning
[10:29.200 --> 10:32.560]  Kurt Nemo's got an excellent report giving you the backstory and the history
[10:32.560 --> 10:41.080]  of it dealing with all of this and so this is extremely extremely important
[10:41.080 --> 10:46.480]  information possible false flag Japanese say oil tanker attacked near
[10:46.480 --> 10:51.520]  Strait of Hormuz now let's go back though this happened this morning there
[10:51.520 --> 10:55.360]  was a series of naval standoff between the US and Iran the Strait of Hormuz in
[10:55.360 --> 11:00.200]  December of 07 and January of 08 the Pentagon accused Iran of threatening
[11:00.200 --> 11:04.200]  the US Fifth Fleet but this was later contradicted by the Navy Admiral Fox
[11:04.200 --> 11:08.440]  Fallon the head of Centcom who then resigned refusing to attack Iran
[11:08.440 --> 11:12.480]  according to press TV a naval officer had literally given the order to fire on
[11:12.480 --> 11:17.600]  the Iranian ships Vice Admiral Kevin J. Cosgriff commander of the Fifth Fleet
[11:17.600 --> 11:21.960]  said the US ships received a radio call that was threatening in nature to the
[11:21.960 --> 11:27.120]  effect that they were closing on our ships and going to attack and that US
[11:27.120 --> 11:31.560]  ships would quote explode Iran characterized the radio communications as
[11:31.560 --> 11:36.680]  a standard transmission between ships and went on to say that they did not put
[11:36.680 --> 11:39.880]  out that transmission later our media claimed it was some type of radio
[11:39.880 --> 11:46.600]  prankster doing it yeah call the called the CIA it goes on on January on on
[11:46.600 --> 11:53.080]  July 8 2008 the mid-level clerical aide to Iran Supreme Leader Ayatollah al
[11:53.080 --> 11:57.680]  Khomeini said the US shipping in the Persian Gulf will be Iran's first targets
[11:57.680 --> 12:04.160]  and they will be burned if there is an attack on Iran it goes on in July of 08
[12:04.160 --> 12:07.880]  Pulitzer Prize winning journalist Seymour Hirsch pulled an audience at the
[12:07.880 --> 12:12.520]  campus progress journalism conference at the Bush administration officials
[12:12.520 --> 12:15.920]  held a meeting with Dick Cheney's office to discuss ways to provoke war with
[12:15.920 --> 12:20.120]  Iran there was a dozen ideas proffered about how to trigger a war there was
[12:20.120 --> 12:25.800]  one that interested me most and this is a quote was why don't we build in our
[12:25.800 --> 12:30.560]  own shipyard build four or five boats that look like Iranian PT boats but Navy
[12:30.560 --> 12:35.760]  seals on them with a lot of arms and next time one of the boats goes in the
[12:35.760 --> 12:44.920]  straight of Hormuz start a shoot-up said Hirsch quoting Cheney and now Japan is
[12:44.920 --> 12:49.320]  announcing that their biggest oil tanker line the second biggest in the world
[12:49.320 --> 12:54.720]  but the biggest for Japan has been attacked and they believe it was some
[12:54.720 --> 12:58.920]  type of terror attack and explosion up against the side of the boat blowing out
[12:58.920 --> 13:04.200]  a bulkhead and damaging some life rafts so this is a very very serious
[13:04.200 --> 13:10.440]  information and this boil down story by Curt Nemo is vital to get out to everyone
[13:10.440 --> 13:15.720]  ahead of the media now starting to latch on to this and promote the fact that Iran
[13:15.720 --> 13:26.120]  has attacked a ship in the straight of Hormuz very very serious developments on
[13:26.120 --> 13:35.600]  that front continuing Israeli defense chief offers warnings on Iran and Lebanon
[13:35.600 --> 13:39.480]  so this echoes what Ahmed Denizide saying about two Middle Eastern countries to be
[13:39.480 --> 13:44.280]  attacked for my intel I believe it's going to be Iran and Syria perhaps
[13:44.280 --> 13:49.440]  Lebanon as well maybe even Gaza this is out of the Washington Post Israeli
[13:49.440 --> 13:53.120]  defense chief offers warning on Iran and Lebanon Israeli defense chief Ehud
[13:53.120 --> 13:58.600]  Barak is due to arrive in Washington bearing two warnings for American
[13:58.600 --> 14:02.760]  policymakers sanctions won't thwart Iran's push for nuclear weapons and
[14:02.760 --> 14:06.360]  Israel will strike directly at Lebanese government institutions of Hezbollah
[14:06.360 --> 14:10.800]  launches rockets in Israel towns in a wide-ranging interview Barak who has
[14:10.800 --> 14:14.440]  become one of Israel's most frequent official guests in Washington outlined
[14:14.440 --> 14:22.680]  his vision for arresting Iran's nuclear drive coping with Hezbollah threat and
[14:22.680 --> 14:29.160]  forging a deal with the Palestinians and he goes on to warn those countries that
[14:29.160 --> 14:36.040]  they may strike them sooner rather than later meanwhile continuing to look at
[14:36.040 --> 14:41.960]  the Middle East Russians say war with Iran is completely unacceptable
[14:41.960 --> 14:47.720]  Dmitry Babich Russia's profile magazine has given an interview saying a war in
[14:47.720 --> 14:52.200]  Iran is absolutely unacceptable for Russia and Russia will everything to
[14:52.200 --> 14:56.240]  prevent that possibility on the other hand Russia is also afraid of Iran
[14:56.240 --> 15:01.040]  getting close to acquiring nuclear weapons so a hedge bet there via
[15:01.040 --> 15:06.960]  statements by Russian government officials Iran has gone on their
[15:06.960 --> 15:14.520]  official press TV organ press blow horn to say Iran's independent of world
[15:14.520 --> 15:19.800]  powers Iran's president Mahmoud Ahmad said the Islamic Republic has gained
[15:19.800 --> 15:23.960]  independence with drawing itself from the circle of influence of economic
[15:23.960 --> 15:28.560]  powers and he went on to say they're preparing to be attacked by the United
[15:28.560 --> 15:36.240]  States and or Israel both a press TV is also reporting something that I know to
[15:36.240 --> 15:40.760]  be true because Bush four years ago had the White House put out a press release
[15:40.760 --> 15:44.760]  reporting what a Psy Hirsch and others had said several years before that that
[15:44.760 --> 15:51.240]  thousands off and on of US special forces Arabic speaking are all over Iran
[15:51.240 --> 15:57.000]  staging terror attacks against military and police installations dams schools
[15:57.000 --> 16:03.360]  trying to elicit a response by Iran inside Iraq coming across the border
[16:03.360 --> 16:07.560]  there just punching him in the nose slapping him in the face rubbing it in
[16:07.560 --> 16:12.840]  trying to get them to respond so World War three can be launched and here's
[16:12.840 --> 16:18.160]  the press TV headline US funds sedition leaders to topple Iran a top Islamic
[16:18.160 --> 16:22.020]  cleric says the US has given the leaders of sedition one billion dollars or to
[16:22.020 --> 16:26.240]  topple the Islamic establishment during last year's post-election unrest yeah
[16:26.240 --> 16:30.080]  that's been done twice the last eight years I have acquired documents showing
[16:30.080 --> 16:33.200]  the Americans paid one billion dollars the leaders of sedition through Saudi
[16:33.200 --> 16:39.480]  individuals the arch enemy of Iran their Sunni Iran Shiite that's why it's so
[16:39.480 --> 16:44.080]  asin I to say Iran is funding al Qaeda when al Qaeda CIA and out of Saudi
[16:44.080 --> 16:51.440]  Arabia it's the opposite it's it's Sunni not Shiite Iran is Shiite Shiite and
[16:51.440 --> 16:54.520]  Sunnis hate each other more than they hate the West I mean do you understand
[16:54.520 --> 16:59.200]  that I have acquired documents showing that Americans paid one billion dollars
[16:59.200 --> 17:02.080]  the leaders of sedition through Saudi Arabian individuals who are currently
[17:02.080 --> 17:08.640]  the US agents in regional countries the ILNA quoted head of the Guardian
[17:08.640 --> 17:15.360]  Council Ayatollah Ahmed Janati as saying yesterday these Saudis who spoke on
[17:15.360 --> 17:18.960]  behalf of the US told the opposition figures that if you can overthrow the
[17:18.960 --> 17:22.720]  Islamic establishment we would pay another 50 billion dollars he added the
[17:22.720 --> 17:26.000]  opposition leaders staged riots with the help of the US and they were
[17:26.000 --> 17:29.080]  confident that the Islamic Revolution would fail with the assistance of the
[17:29.080 --> 17:32.960]  US because it is soft war which causes people to break away from the Islamic
[17:32.960 --> 17:36.800]  system he explained the Iranian cleric further pointed out the system which
[17:36.800 --> 17:40.080]  does not enjoy the support of the nation will collapse automatically
[17:40.080 --> 17:45.280]  Ayatollah Janati said Saudi Arabia is a bang the US in a servile manner and
[17:45.280 --> 17:49.400]  added that Iran is the only country which stood by itself and shunted death to
[17:49.400 --> 17:55.640]  America with strength you know these these Ayatollahs on record were put
[17:55.640 --> 18:01.480]  into power against the Shah there was a arms for hostages deal it was a way to
[18:01.480 --> 18:07.040]  double-cross Jimmy Carter and that's all been declassified it was all states I
[18:07.040 --> 18:10.640]  don't trust these guys any more than I trust the globalists that run our
[18:10.640 --> 18:15.800]  country and they play into this paradigm of death to America death to America
[18:15.800 --> 18:21.200]  America's been seized by the very banks that ran your country until 53 and then
[18:21.200 --> 18:27.800]  re overthrew it for that brief time after 53 and so death to America it's the
[18:27.800 --> 18:31.600]  globalists that are killing the United States
[18:32.920 --> 18:39.600]  nevertheless either way you slice it dice it any any angle you look at this

[18:45.720 --> 18:51.800]  financial economic military cultural all being triggered the dominoes are now in
[18:51.800 --> 18:58.520]  motion and all of us have to realize that world government is being formed a
[18:58.520 --> 19:02.440]  new planetary bank that you pay your carbon taxes to that controls your
[19:02.440 --> 19:06.360]  domestic government every major nation from Greece to the United States it's
[19:06.360 --> 19:10.840]  fallen to these bankers is passing or has passed legislation to give the banking
[19:10.840 --> 19:14.080]  cartel that created the trillions and derivatives total power over the
[19:14.080 --> 19:20.600]  economy and they need to start a war as a political smoke screen to complete
[19:20.600 --> 19:25.080]  their takeover the good news is people are starting to wake up to this but not
[19:25.080 --> 19:30.200]  fast enough and so these are the times that try men and women souls the
[19:30.200 --> 19:34.560]  quickening is here the acceleration is upon us you're going to see stage
[19:34.560 --> 19:38.080]  terror attacks to be blamed on domestic groups you're going to see stage
[19:38.080 --> 19:44.840]  terror attacks to be blamed on foreign governments that's now inevitable if we
[19:44.840 --> 19:48.640]  cause a giant awakening the globalists may back off but at this time they have

[24:16.080 --> 24:19.720]  little bacon and we took a little beans and they caught the bloody British in
[24:19.720 --> 24:23.960]  a town in New Orleans we fired our guns and the British kept becoming there
[24:23.960 --> 24:28.680]  wasn't as many as there was a while ago we fired one smore and they began to

[24:41.760 --> 24:45.680]  here in front of us look at how just a year ago Al Gore would go to public
[24:45.680 --> 24:52.400]  events promoting global carbon taxes and taxes on basically all human
[24:52.400 --> 24:56.680]  activity in the United States China India and others are exempt that would
[24:56.680 --> 25:00.840]  simply move what industry we have left over there notice how he was still a
[25:00.840 --> 25:05.720]  god he was believed he would get before Congress and say no one questions
[25:05.720 --> 25:11.440]  global warming all scientists agree it's man-made we're all dead if you don't pay
[25:11.440 --> 25:17.880]  me tax money and now he does hardly any public events everywhere he goes people
[25:17.880 --> 25:24.520]  infiltrate and shout him down and because that aura of invincibility has
[25:24.520 --> 25:31.040]  been shattered a three and a half year old police investigation dealing with
[25:31.040 --> 25:35.920]  sexual assault has been reopened and the woman claims she's got the equivalent
[25:35.920 --> 25:43.160]  of the blue dressed Al got a little excited and KO MO TV reports Al Gore

[26:04.760 --> 26:09.680]  07 recording the message therapists claims that Gore grabbed and groped her
[26:09.680 --> 26:15.800]  and chased her around by the way with a erection when she gave him a massage at
[26:15.800 --> 26:21.440]  Portland Hotel in October of 06 the woman went public in June 23rd National
[26:21.440 --> 26:27.960]  Enquirer story just like they did with John Edwards and held up soiled pants for

[27:06.920 --> 27:10.200]  two other massage therapists those therapists who worked in hotels in
[27:10.200 --> 27:14.200]  Tokyo and Los Angeles have also claimed Gore made unwanted sexual advances

[34:19.880 --> 34:27.040]  magazine and MSNBC from Sy Hirsh and how does that tie into the war drums with
[34:27.040 --> 34:30.280]  Ahmed energy saying he's got intel that the strike on Iran and one other
[34:30.280 --> 34:33.920]  Middle Eastern country possibly Lebanon or Syria will happen in the next three
[34:33.920 --> 34:37.760]  months we'll talk about the economy the deep hitting depression also dr. Paul
[34:37.760 --> 34:42.080]  Craig Roberts sent us an editorial yesterday to post up at info wars.com
[34:42.080 --> 34:45.960]  we appreciate him giving us his columns and it just went up this morning the
[34:45.960 --> 34:50.560]  year America dissolved and he's predicting a road warrior type collapse
[34:50.560 --> 34:54.520]  if this malfeasing and deindustrialization program continues I'll cover
[34:54.520 --> 34:59.120]  that after tarply leaves us in about 57 minutes from now and we're going to have
[34:59.120 --> 35:04.320]  open phones later in the next hour and then in the third hour phone calls just
[35:04.320 --> 35:11.200]  for military and police about top secret USA because it's not just 854,000
[35:11.200 --> 35:14.880]  private corporate people with the highest security clearance spying on
[35:14.880 --> 35:19.560]  everyone it's the 3 million police and others being converted over to literal
[35:19.560 --> 35:24.000]  domestic Stasi forces so that's coming up before I go any further you know the
[35:24.000 --> 35:28.320]  Obama deception has been censored and attacked all over the web and demonized
[35:28.320 --> 35:33.360]  there have been multiple dirty tricks to bring it down false copyright claims
[35:33.360 --> 35:38.200]  that we were able to correct three months ago then the deletion by YouTube
[35:38.200 --> 35:43.000]  and Google two weeks ago it's back up because of protest don't let them stop
[35:43.000 --> 35:47.320]  you get it and get it out to everyone get the hard copy highest quality DVD with

[37:09.080 --> 37:12.840]  radio show the news websites everything we're doing and where can you say
[37:12.840 --> 37:16.960]  anybody's having a bigger effect than this show it's quite a responsibility and
[37:16.960 --> 37:20.200]  we're honored to be here and to be a platform for all these informative
[37:20.200 --> 37:24.960]  guests that we bring on the show like dr. Tarpley dr. Tarpley good to have you
[37:24.960 --> 37:29.840]  here with us sir thank you Alex so much is happening we've only got less than an
[37:29.840 --> 37:35.360]  hour with you you're been deluged by the storm and falling trees and anytime now
[37:35.360 --> 37:38.600]  arborists may come to the door to cut down the fallen trees so we're gonna
[37:38.600 --> 37:43.920]  move quickly you've got the floor wiki leaks tied into Iran tied into the
[37:43.920 --> 37:48.800]  unfolding depression and calls to censor the internet Webster Tarpley well I
[37:48.800 --> 37:52.360]  would start by saying that the wiki leaks and the person of this strange
[37:52.360 --> 37:59.840]  Julian Assange fulfills that the prima facie case for a a limited hangout
[37:59.840 --> 38:05.840]  operation by the intelligence agencies themselves in a broad sense when you
[38:05.840 --> 38:10.680]  include things like project democracy on the US side when you look at the
[38:10.680 --> 38:15.480]  Soros group of foundations and so forth and look at them as a part of the
[38:15.480 --> 38:21.000]  intelligence community that seems to be what we have in the goal of course the
[38:21.000 --> 38:25.840]  all of the US coverage in particular focuses the attack on Pakistan that the
[38:25.840 --> 38:34.200]  big news here is not war crimes by Bush or Cheney or Obama or or Gates or any of
[38:34.200 --> 38:39.040]  these people but it's rather the perfidy and the treachery of Pakistan so we're
[38:39.040 --> 38:44.000]  we're essentially got a case where they're saying the Afghanistan war is
[38:44.000 --> 38:48.560]  not going well let's dump that but dump that country into chaos let's focus on
[38:48.560 --> 38:53.560]  Iran and Pakistan above all because this comes out one week to interrupt one
[38:53.560 --> 38:58.840]  week after they admit okay advisors are in Pakistan US troops are there black
[38:58.840 --> 39:03.360]  water is there something they've been denying for two years as the CIA drone
[39:03.360 --> 39:08.280]  attacks intensify I remember a year and a half ago in Mumbai they blame general
[39:08.280 --> 39:12.240]  Hamid ghoul he called me and said I'd like to come on and set the record
[39:12.240 --> 39:16.320]  straight he says he doesn't want to come on at this time he didn't give us the
[39:16.320 --> 39:21.920]  reasons but the point is he said Western intelligence ran this attack and then it
[39:21.920 --> 39:25.720]  came out two months ago in the Chicago Tribune that the head of the Mumbai
[39:25.720 --> 39:30.760]  attack is a CIA agent from the United States and the head of Indians
[39:30.760 --> 39:34.800]  intelligence said the same thing so they're always trying to blame Pakistan
[39:34.800 --> 39:38.800]  right Pakistan is a target let's focus for a minute on on WikiLeaks and this
[39:38.800 --> 39:45.640]  up yes I signed remember Cass Sunstein the totalitarian liberal regulations are
[39:45.640 --> 39:51.600]  in the Obama White House and he came out with this article some months back
[39:51.600 --> 39:56.120]  where he said what we need to do is to have the cognitive disruption of the
[39:56.120 --> 39:59.920]  9-11 truth movement in which we've got to put out our own disinformation and
[39:59.920 --> 40:05.040]  try to try to disrupt and interfere with the process he said that he said we'll
[40:05.040 --> 40:10.400]  pose as patriots online to get credibility to attack other patriots
[40:10.400 --> 40:14.200]  and so that's why you see the co-intel pro against me you're claiming I'm bad
[40:14.200 --> 40:17.320]  because they know they have no credibility from the government view
[40:17.320 --> 40:21.960]  they've got to pose as activists while simultaneously pushing to censor the
[40:21.960 --> 40:25.600]  internet right and of course it's not limited to people coming on with a
[40:25.600 --> 40:30.680]  patriotic or right of center profile at all it's it includes ultra left
[40:30.680 --> 40:35.440]  spectrum be this is Soros's specialty so I think what we have here is a rather
[40:35.440 --> 40:39.360]  sophisticated thing they don't come on saying we're neocons and we don't like
[40:39.360 --> 40:43.800]  9-11 truth they come on saying we're the extremely radical hunted group of
[40:43.800 --> 40:48.800]  rebels and anti-authoritarians and we're telling you that the Pakistan is the
[40:48.800 --> 40:54.480]  devil which is just exactly what the the mainstream media is and the signs comes
[40:54.480 --> 40:58.800]  out the tax 9-11 truth yes exactly and that's the thing in Belfast recess he's
[40:58.800 --> 41:04.440]  ignored by 9-11 truth let's just look at this the big lies of course of the past
[41:04.440 --> 41:09.400]  10 years the lie of the 21st century is of course terrorism itself al Qaeda bin
[41:09.400 --> 41:15.360]  Laden the papers that that Assange has released include all kinds of references
[41:15.360 --> 41:20.480]  to Osama bin Laden how he's in Quetta he's taking part in the Quetta Shura this
[41:20.480 --> 41:25.360]  council of alleged terrorist chiefs which be the mainline you know ABC News and
[41:25.360 --> 41:31.120]  NBC News we've got to go into Pakistan and get him precisely so this and then
[41:31.120 --> 41:35.720]  then the attack on 9-11 truth I think is that is the most significant what he's
[41:35.720 --> 41:41.440]  really saying is the conspiracies that are approved are my conspiracies as a
[41:41.440 --> 41:45.640]  start right if you've got a conspiracy approved by Assange that's fine but some
[41:45.640 --> 41:51.400]  other conspiracy is not in the mainstream of conspiracies so let's just
[41:51.400 --> 41:55.240]  look at the background who is this guy that one of the most obvious things is
[41:55.240 --> 42:01.440]  who pays him who pays for this lifestyle that he has he is a nomad as
[42:01.440 --> 42:05.160]  we're told right he's somebody who jets around the world he's kind of a jet set
[42:05.160 --> 42:10.080]  nomad living out of a backpack showing up in different parts he's got a spy
[42:10.080 --> 42:14.640]  profile well yes but but of a special kind I would call him a picker-esque
[42:14.640 --> 42:18.520]  agent I'm referring back to the the picker-esque novel like you know Tom
[42:18.520 --> 42:22.360]  Jones by Fielding where people are always moving around right they're always
[42:22.360 --> 42:26.280]  traveling through a landscape and then they never stop and that seems to be
[42:26.280 --> 42:32.520]  Assange now what's his background his parents in Australia ran a traveling
[42:32.520 --> 42:37.840]  theater company so that he seems to have attended about 37 different schools
[42:37.840 --> 42:43.880]  during the time that he was a child so he's been born into this lifestyle of
[42:43.880 --> 42:49.360]  moving around but the really sinister thing is that that Assange's mother and
[42:49.360 --> 42:54.480]  half-brother well along with Assange were on the run according to with the
[42:54.480 --> 42:59.400]  Wikipedia they were fleeing from the father of the half-brother in other
[42:59.400 --> 43:05.120]  words the second husband of the of the mother who was trying to get them and
[43:05.120 --> 43:12.240]  take them back to a cult which was the Anne Hamilton burn cult which is
[43:12.240 --> 43:16.600]  essentially a group of people near Melbourne Australia who were using
[43:16.600 --> 43:22.000]  LSD as a treatment for children and what they called therapy was to give a
[43:22.000 --> 43:28.040]  child LSD or psychopharmica and then lock the child in a dark room so this is
[43:28.040 --> 43:32.200]  the classic cover for an intelligence agency mind control program yes but it
[43:32.200 --> 43:36.200]  what it what it the thing that it turns out and that was the end product of such
[43:36.200 --> 43:43.400]  a such a cult are a group of them and severely impaired specimens I think one
[43:43.400 --> 43:46.920]  of them might might well be assigned I I don't know what I'm saying he may be a
[43:46.920 --> 43:53.240]  mega-patsy he may well he may be somebody who's got severe problems that
[43:53.240 --> 43:57.560]  make him suggestible and make him manipulable by people what he seems to
[43:57.560 --> 44:01.840]  have gotten out of this is a tremendous anti-authoritarian hatred for
[44:01.840 --> 44:06.760]  governments for corporations really for any institution is his attack seems to
[44:06.760 --> 44:12.640]  be against any and all institutions notice he is not anti-war he does not
[44:12.640 --> 44:17.520]  say that the US should get out of Afghanistan and stop interfering in
[44:17.520 --> 44:22.760]  Pakistan he just says whatever you want to do be transparent right make it clear
[44:22.760 --> 44:27.280]  what you're doing be humane and try to reform it and really that's all he has
[44:27.280 --> 44:31.360]  to say there's there's no theoretical basis for this he doesn't talk about
[44:31.360 --> 44:36.960]  imperialism he doesn't talk about you know Anglo-American banking he doesn't
[44:36.960 --> 44:41.200]  talk about a new world order he doesn't talk about any concept that might allow
[44:41.200 --> 44:45.240]  somebody to make sense of this you know from whatever point of view in other
[44:45.240 --> 44:49.720]  words he just doesn't go there there's no element of that so I think this is a
[44:49.720 --> 44:54.240]  very very suspicious and strange individual now if we look at the
[44:54.240 --> 45:00.000]  institution what is WikiLeaks they have a board and you can look on the the
[45:00.000 --> 45:04.440]  internet right Wayne Madsen and other people have done useful work on this if
[45:04.440 --> 45:09.120]  you look at the board the board seems to be packed with people from this sort of
[45:09.120 --> 45:14.480]  Soros left-wing of the Anglo-American intelligence and Cass Sunstein has
[45:14.480 --> 45:19.560]  praised it yes well that's very interesting and it did seem again I
[45:19.560 --> 45:23.280]  think this is more of his project this is how they would do it it wouldn't come
[45:23.280 --> 45:27.640]  on them on the scene you know in the official CIA it can't so we have this
[45:27.640 --> 45:33.040]  guy Ben Lowry who's a former security boss of Google and of course as many
[45:33.040 --> 45:40.160]  have pointed out Google was essentially a project of this it's a proprietary
[45:40.160 --> 45:45.840]  investment company run by the CIA and in Kutel and that's now on record I mean
[45:45.840 --> 45:50.080]  I mean they've got their campuses now their research campuses at NASA I mean
[45:50.080 --> 45:54.760]  this is the public face of the NSA with the public rollout and adoption of full
[45:54.760 --> 45:58.960]  NSA control right and we know now that we had it on the front page of the
[45:58.960 --> 46:02.840]  Washington Post here that Google and the National Security Agency are in a
[46:02.840 --> 46:07.320]  partnership they are in a lockstep they've practically merged so so the
[46:07.320 --> 46:11.160]  one of the people on the board comes from that and otherwise you have a large
[46:11.160 --> 46:17.400]  group of these US backed dissidents coming from China you have one Don who has
[46:17.400 --> 46:21.760]  gotten the Project Democracy Award right from essentially from the US
[46:21.760 --> 46:25.240]  government you've got this guy so they're trying to get their credibility
[46:25.240 --> 46:28.840]  right now to start pumping out info what against corporations they want to
[46:28.840 --> 46:33.280]  bring down against other governments I mean if this is an operation and as you
[46:33.280 --> 46:36.760]  said Assange may be a great guy and is being manipulated I mean they've
[46:36.760 --> 46:40.880]  released the Army manual about how to stage false flag terror that's great
[46:40.880 --> 46:45.440]  work they released the helicopter gun footage that I think is important work
[46:45.440 --> 46:48.760]  but that's how an intelligence op would work they would give you good info
[46:48.760 --> 46:52.840]  up front to get your confidence I mean I don't think we can say a hundred percent
[46:52.840 --> 46:57.160]  that these are bad guys but but certainly the way that the New York Times the
[46:57.160 --> 47:03.520]  Guardian and their Spiegel have spun the material all against Pakistan and how
[47:03.520 --> 47:06.400]  they're propping up the myth and this isn't really top secret it's just
[47:06.400 --> 47:11.560]  secret material battlefield communiques which are famous for being used you know
[47:11.560 --> 47:16.400]  fake body counts you name it to put out Pentagon propaganda we can also see that
[47:16.400 --> 47:21.200]  that the intimate cooperation with the New York Times with the Guardian of
[47:21.200 --> 47:25.080]  London and with their Spiegel of Germany right these are three arch
[47:25.080 --> 47:31.640]  establishmentarian vaguely very vaguely center left on that's admitted I mean it
[47:31.640 --> 47:36.480]  turns out the New York Times quote crawl do Obama for instructions on wiki
[47:36.480 --> 47:40.840]  leaks weeks before so Assange kept saying it's coming out it's coming out
[47:40.840 --> 47:44.440]  it turns out that's why all the newspapers were going to the government
[47:44.440 --> 47:47.800]  saying what do we do with this the government said do it right but I mean
[47:47.800 --> 47:51.080]  that's that's a hundred percent proof right there that I mean I'm sorry go
[47:51.080 --> 47:54.520]  ahead Alex you and I know that but if you if you're coming out with some
[47:54.520 --> 47:58.480]  revelation that the government doesn't want say something about 9-11 truth you
[47:58.480 --> 48:02.600]  don't get the New York Times the Guardian and their Spiegel cooperating with you
[48:02.600 --> 48:07.560]  there's a Beagle in particular had a whole cover story on conspiracy fanatics
[48:07.560 --> 48:12.680]  who turn the world upside down 9-11 truth or lunatics anti-Semites and and all
[48:12.680 --> 48:19.400]  the rest of this crazy stuff a couple of other other things about it the
[48:19.400 --> 48:26.720]  Assange claims to be a PhD according to Madsen this is from a diploma mill there
[48:26.720 --> 48:31.240]  was at the beginning of his career he'd be purported to come from Kenya he
[48:31.240 --> 48:35.200]  apparently does not come from Kenya he comes from Australia there is this
[48:35.200 --> 48:41.040]  strange book that he contributed to underground tales of hacking and madmen
[48:41.040 --> 48:45.880]  in which Assange appears as the character Mendax which is simply the Latin
[48:45.880 --> 48:52.920]  word for a liar so it's a it's a it's a very very uncertain individual a very
[48:52.920 --> 48:57.240]  very uncertain group they seem to work with the so he picks the name Darth
[48:57.240 --> 49:01.840]  liar I mean this is the boy that tells you something something like that and
[49:01.840 --> 49:06.400]  it's a pattern of course right remember ultra-left financiers of the Soros type
[49:06.400 --> 49:12.400]  love to sponsor ultra-left the sort of subversive groups you go to France you'll
[49:12.400 --> 49:17.260]  see the main left-wing newspaper liberation the main Parisian left-wing
[49:17.260 --> 49:20.760]  papers controlled by its own by Baron Rothschild and they've been all sorts of
[49:20.760 --> 49:25.640]  scandals about that well look I have George Soros every day with media matters
[49:25.640 --> 49:29.960]  that he's the main contributor to and others attacking me and basically saying
[49:29.960 --> 49:35.600]  I'm Satan so this guy I mean we know that that he's he's active everywhere right
[49:35.600 --> 49:39.920]  and then let's then look at as you say quite properly right you've got to put
[49:39.920 --> 49:43.680]  in good information in order to get to get some credibility couple of stories
[49:43.680 --> 49:50.040]  about this I was in Iceland last September October and I had a chance
[49:50.040 --> 49:55.480]  to give a lecture series in Reykjavik five nights in a row I was on the main
[49:55.480 --> 50:01.440]  television news program on the Sunday right the blab show and what I was
[50:01.440 --> 50:06.120]  recommending and really calling on them to do is declare a debt moratorium
[50:06.120 --> 50:11.920]  freeze your debt stop paying your debt cancel your debt don't negotiate under
[50:11.920 --> 50:16.040]  the gun of the British and the Dutch and the IMF and the European Commission but
[50:16.040 --> 50:20.520]  start by having a debt moratorium in the way that Mexico and Argentina and
[50:20.520 --> 50:25.200]  Brazil and about 35 other countries down to Costa Rica very small countries
[50:25.200 --> 50:30.880]  with no no military just like Iceland have done it and about a couple of
[50:30.880 --> 50:35.520]  months after I had departed into town blows Julian Assange who goes
[50:35.520 --> 50:39.600]  strangely enough to some of the very same people and apparently tells them
[50:39.600 --> 50:44.360]  forget about this debt moratorium stuff what we need to do here is to have this
[50:44.360 --> 50:49.920]  internet free zone in other words a world haven for hackers for pornographers
[50:49.920 --> 50:53.760]  for other people on the internet and let's let's set that up and we'll have

[54:25.920 --> 54:30.160]  minutes I got a bunch of other issues I want to get into him with let's son in
[54:30.160 --> 54:33.920]  this five-minute segment finish up with the wiki leaks webster I'm gonna sit
[54:33.920 --> 54:39.280]  back finish up your points on Iceland and the net effect of the arrival of a
[54:39.280 --> 54:43.920]  sergeant in Reykjavik Iceland was to convince a whole bunch of people who
[54:43.920 --> 54:47.880]  had started this dead moratorium agitation which it seems to me is the
[54:47.880 --> 54:52.440]  only answer for the survival of the country and go with this gimmick really
[54:52.440 --> 54:57.480]  which was to say let's let's essentially act along the Soros program let's set up
[54:57.480 --> 55:04.320]  a haven for internet hackers for various websites from around the world
[55:04.320 --> 55:10.520]  will guarantee no no no censorship or anything like this so therefore you
[55:10.520 --> 55:15.160]  can see how the guy operates here's another one the norm Coleman question
[55:15.160 --> 55:19.040]  right norm Coleman was of course the senator from Minnesota in many ways a
[55:19.040 --> 55:23.120]  nasty fellow I certainly didn't like him but there was a there was a fight
[55:23.120 --> 55:27.080]  between norm Coleman and Soros over who was going to become the president of the
[55:27.080 --> 55:31.600]  world bank and norm norm colt well Soros had his own candidate a guy called
[55:31.600 --> 55:38.720]  Ford malloc brown baron brown and Coleman was opposing him so this seems to
[55:38.720 --> 55:42.000]  have contributed to the to the huge amount of money that was put into that
[55:42.000 --> 55:46.200]  Al Franken campaign but in the middle of that there was also an intervention by
[55:46.200 --> 55:50.960]  WikiLeaks against norm Coleman but they published his whole contributors list
[55:50.960 --> 55:55.440]  with with the many many details of the individual lives that these these
[55:55.440 --> 56:00.520]  people so that's extremely suspicious bank that's the idea you gain
[56:00.520 --> 56:03.960]  credibility with a lot of good information and then you can put in the
[56:03.960 --> 56:07.640]  fake information that targets the people that you want to target for a
[56:07.640 --> 56:11.920]  completely different reasons but of course the big thing is Pakistan right if
[56:11.920 --> 56:14.960]  you look at the the London Guardian right which is the left wing of the
[56:14.960 --> 56:20.080]  British intelligence agencies you see that their coverage focuses on two
[56:20.080 --> 56:26.280]  things that the the 90,000 odd documents very low-level secret level
[56:26.280 --> 56:30.760]  essentially routine interoffice correspondence in the government labeled
[56:30.760 --> 56:38.280]  secret these say Pakistan is treacherous Pakistan betrays the US Pakistan is a
[56:38.280 --> 56:42.920]  bad ally they stab us in the back and that then is giving rise now to this
[56:42.920 --> 56:47.240]  huge anti-Pakistani campaign the attacks on General Gould and others the
[56:47.240 --> 56:53.000]  demonization of the ISI and so forth but then also Iran the Guardian
[56:53.000 --> 56:58.640]  focused on Iran that Iran is is fomenting a whole array of account of
[56:58.640 --> 57:03.120]  insurgencies in in their part of Afghanistan along their border and
[57:03.120 --> 57:07.160]  they're gonna they're gonna keep doing that so you left with the idea it's
[57:07.160 --> 57:13.480]  good it's gonna be a good idea to de-emphasize and downplay the Afghan
[57:13.480 --> 57:18.160]  war and look now at your real enemies in the area who are these two big states
[57:18.160 --> 57:23.400]  Iran and Pakistan and it seems to me one of the obvious things is to play one
[57:23.400 --> 57:28.560]  against the other and that's a pattern that you see the US strategy in the
[57:28.560 --> 57:32.960]  entire Middle East is to try to line up a group of states that would be Arab
[57:32.960 --> 57:39.160]  and Sunni plus a couple of others against Iran which is Iranian Persian and
[57:39.160 --> 57:45.520]  also Shiite and the big call for the attack on Iran Iran that you can read
[57:45.520 --> 57:50.880]  about in in my essay that I put on the internet you have it also on on on
[57:50.880 --> 58:00.880]  info wars is that you've got the the the Gulf States Saudi Arabia United Arab
[58:00.880 --> 58:07.560]  Emirates are very they've been jazzed up by the US obviously to demand the
[58:07.560 --> 58:12.280]  attack on Iran because this threatens them so they're they're raising this
[58:12.280 --> 58:16.400]  human crime the example of course is the the ambassador from the United Arab
[58:16.400 --> 58:20.160]  Emirates in Aspen Colorado about two or three weeks ago who went into a public
[58:20.160 --> 58:24.560]  high raid we demand an attack on Iran immediately what is this we're willing to
[58:24.560 --> 58:30.080]  take the cost you Americans get busy this is at the Aspen ideas festival so
[58:30.080 --> 58:33.800]  our Webster going on and we keep the WikiLeaks feeds right into this
[58:33.800 --> 58:38.160]  agitation just at the proper moment it's all very suspicious stay there
[58:38.160 --> 58:53.280]  Webster this is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a
[58:53.280 --> 58:57.600]  solar power generator number one new climate legislation could easily double
[58:57.600 --> 59:01.800]  or triple your electric bill number two our new energies are wants to control
[59:01.800 --> 59:05.840]  how much power your electric company allows you to have it's true total
[59:05.840 --> 59:09.720]  government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is
[59:09.720 --> 59:14.000]  coming number three in some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously
[59:14.000 --> 59:18.160]  overloaded and now new socialist legislation is only compounding the
[59:18.160 --> 59:22.480]  problem number four dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids every
[59:22.480 --> 59:26.200]  year thousands of families lose their power from weather related onages number
[59:26.200 --> 59:30.400]  five a solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of
[59:30.400 --> 59:33.800]  mind folks I really believe in the solar power generators offered by solutions
[59:33.800 --> 59:37.520]  from science one of my oldest sponsors you can get more information at
[59:37.520 --> 59:43.040]  www.mysolarbackup.com that's mysolarbackup.com remember the government
[59:43.040 --> 59:51.280]  doesn't own the sun so go to mysolarbackup.com or call 1-877-327-0365
[59:51.280 --> 01:00:06.120]  waging war on corruption Alex Jones on the GCN radio network big brother
[01:00:06.120 --> 01:00:13.480]  mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he he's
[01:00:13.480 --> 01:00:22.240]  Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones
[01:00:22.240 --> 01:00:26.360]  Webster Griffin Tarpley is our guest we're gonna open the phones up when he
[01:00:26.360 --> 01:00:32.480]  leaves us in 30 minutes toll-train number to join us 800-259-9231 I want to
[01:00:32.480 --> 01:00:37.080]  get into the open discussion now and the open green lighting of an attack on
[01:00:37.080 --> 01:00:40.800]  Iran as Webster Tarpley agree with Ahmed Denizide that the attacks in the next
[01:00:40.800 --> 01:00:45.360]  three months that's coming up also I want to ask Tarpley about top Clinton
[01:00:45.360 --> 01:00:49.920]  official and advisor to Obama Robert Shapiro saying hey we need a stage
[01:00:49.920 --> 01:00:53.400]  terror attack I'm gonna read that quote coming up we're gonna talk about the
[01:00:53.400 --> 01:00:58.440]  economy we're gonna get into other dirty tricks he sees the Obamanoids pulling
[01:00:58.440 --> 01:01:02.920]  as there's a major political realignment taking place but Webster
[01:01:02.920 --> 01:01:06.760]  Griffin Tarpley is our guest I was actually gonna ask Tarpley about this
[01:01:06.760 --> 01:01:10.880]  and I was talking during the break he brought it up himself the similarities
[01:01:10.880 --> 01:01:15.280]  between WikiLeaks and Daniel Ellsberg and I know Fletcher Proudy said he
[01:01:15.280 --> 01:01:20.000]  wrote many of those documents that that when he was they had a black ops at the
[01:01:20.000 --> 01:01:24.400]  Pentagon that the Rand Corporation then later put out through Daniel Ellsberg
[01:01:24.400 --> 01:01:30.000]  and Fletcher Proudy said that they'd been altered and were fake and that it
[01:01:30.000 --> 01:01:34.040]  was a disinfo honeypot and then Tarpley was just now agreeing with that during
[01:01:34.040 --> 01:01:36.760]  the break and seeing their similarities with this and WikiLeaks
[01:01:36.760 --> 01:01:40.440]  Webster let's a finish up with WikiLeaks and get into Iran go ahead the big thing
[01:01:40.440 --> 01:01:45.760]  we hear from Assange is he says that he is the modern equivalent of Daniel Ellsberg
[01:01:45.760 --> 01:01:50.680]  and the Pentagon Papers of June 1971 this was an internal history of the
[01:01:50.680 --> 01:01:56.200]  Vietnam involvement Vietnam War prepared really during the Johnson years but
[01:01:56.200 --> 01:02:00.440]  then leaked in the spectacular way with the help of the same New York Times and
[01:02:00.440 --> 01:02:07.320]  the Washington Post and the the Boston Globe in June and July of 1971 which
[01:02:07.320 --> 01:02:14.080]  drove Nixon crazy this was done by Daniel Ellsberg who for many leftists in
[01:02:14.080 --> 01:02:18.600]  particular still a hero I've never been able to understand this Daniel Ellsberg
[01:02:18.600 --> 01:02:23.760]  was a nuclear weapons planner from the Rand Corporation he had been part of
[01:02:23.760 --> 01:02:29.360]  planning the Vietnam War he was a member of Henry Kissinger's staff in the
[01:02:29.360 --> 01:02:33.800]  White House and then he had a Damascus Road conversion he became anti-war
[01:02:33.800 --> 01:02:38.600]  conscience-stricken and released all of this stuff and as you say there was
[01:02:38.600 --> 01:02:43.920]  nothing new in these papers if you had been reading Le Mans de France or any
[01:02:43.920 --> 01:02:48.800]  of the big Italian papers you knew all this I mean I knew most of it myself just
[01:02:48.800 --> 01:02:53.120]  by by having read these things there was nothing really that new in it but what
[01:02:53.120 --> 01:02:58.800]  it did do was constitute a leak which drove Nixon crazy Nixon was of course a
[01:02:58.800 --> 01:03:04.760]  paranoid personality and Nixon had been extremely freaked out that same year
[01:03:04.760 --> 01:03:10.800]  1971 there'd been a huge crisis between India and Pakistan this is what led to
[01:03:10.800 --> 01:03:14.640]  the creation of Bangladesh that year with wars genocide the Russians it's
[01:03:14.640 --> 01:03:18.840]  now been declassified came to the US with a joint strike on China and Nixon
[01:03:18.840 --> 01:03:23.600]  had said no as well no because Nixon was allying with China at that time that was
[01:03:23.600 --> 01:03:27.840]  the whole point why did the elite sabotage Nixon because that's that's
[01:03:27.840 --> 01:03:33.080]  clear and admitted now that Hague and Kissinger and others did that why did
[01:03:33.080 --> 01:03:36.560]  the establishment turn on Nixon I think there were two things one is that they
[01:03:36.560 --> 01:03:40.480]  they have sincerely wanted at that point to liquidate the Vietnam War and and
[01:03:40.480 --> 01:03:44.160]  focus on other other things that were coming up but there's also the question
[01:03:44.160 --> 01:03:49.560]  of weakening the presidency with Nixon it sounds bombastic and theatrical in
[01:03:49.560 --> 01:03:54.560]  retrospect but there were these aspects of an imperial presidency right Nixon
[01:03:54.560 --> 01:03:59.200]  wanted to be an authoritarian he wanted to to have a strong presidency and this
[01:03:59.200 --> 01:04:03.800]  was exactly what the oligarchy didn't want think of it the Washington Post is
[01:04:03.800 --> 01:04:08.320]  really the house organ of the Federal Reserve system the Washington Post was
[01:04:08.320 --> 01:04:13.280]  founded by Eugene Meyer who was a refugee from the Federal Reserve he hated
[01:04:13.280 --> 01:04:17.760]  Roosevelt he disagreed with Roosevelt's economic policies and he set the the
[01:04:17.760 --> 01:04:22.400]  Washington Post up as the paper that he bought in the Capitol here to be an
[01:04:22.400 --> 01:04:27.480]  anti-Rosevelt and then later anti-presidential anti-government in
[01:04:27.480 --> 01:04:32.800]  that sense organ so the Washington Post always stands for a weak presidency
[01:04:32.800 --> 01:04:36.280]  and ultimately for a strong Federal Reserve so I think the idea was
[01:04:36.280 --> 01:04:40.200]  permanently weakened the president with the Watergate coup and they succeeded
[01:04:40.200 --> 01:04:44.560]  because they look at the people after that Ford Carter really very very weak
[01:04:44.560 --> 01:04:50.920]  president all right stay there let's get into Iran and the war clouds storm clouds
[01:04:50.920 --> 01:04:56.760]  forming on that front the economy and false flag chair straight ahead with

[01:08:07.440 --> 01:08:14.040]  the GCN radio network you have found it the front lines of the info war the tip
[01:08:14.040 --> 01:08:18.880]  of the spear we're here six days a week sundays 4 to 6 p.m. central and of
[01:08:18.880 --> 01:08:23.180]  course kicking off weekdays at 11 a.m. central here's the headline from two
[01:08:23.180 --> 01:08:26.280]  weeks ago and I keep making a big deal out of this because it's so important
[01:08:26.280 --> 01:08:31.000]  top Clinton official only a terror attack can save Obama they told the
[01:08:31.000 --> 01:08:35.000]  Bilderberg group House organ the Financial Times of London even more
[01:08:35.000 --> 01:08:39.440]  elitist in the Washington Post he said the bottom line here is that Americans
[01:08:39.440 --> 01:08:43.880]  don't believe in President Obama's leadership said Shapiro adding quote he
[01:08:43.880 --> 01:08:47.840]  has to find some way between now and November of demonstrating that he is a
[01:08:47.840 --> 01:08:53.120]  leader who can command confidence and short of a new 9-11 event or an Oklahoma
[01:08:53.120 --> 01:08:59.240]  City bombing I can't think of how he can do that now I want to get into Iran but
[01:08:59.240 --> 01:09:03.200]  I want to put it in a context of where you see the Anglo-American establishment
[01:09:03.200 --> 01:09:06.600]  every time I say that I got emails saying don't bash white people it has
[01:09:06.600 --> 01:09:11.040]  nothing to do with white people it means the US British Dutch power arm
[01:09:11.040 --> 01:09:15.480]  that's what they call it themselves the the the heart of the global banking
[01:09:15.480 --> 01:09:19.640]  cartel at a key point of announcing world government global carbon taxes
[01:09:19.640 --> 01:09:24.920]  Malthusian initiatives the world is now awakening to them I would have from my
[01:09:24.920 --> 01:09:29.000]  basic forecast say that they're in deep trouble they admit they're in deep
[01:09:29.000 --> 01:09:32.760]  trouble they're panicking they're saying they want to shut down freedom on the
[01:09:32.760 --> 01:09:38.640]  web because we are devastating them so Webster in context Iran as a false flag
[01:09:38.640 --> 01:09:43.480]  event itself using a straight of Hormuz event to launch that how does that tie
[01:09:43.480 --> 01:09:48.440]  into other false flags looking into your historical crystal ball what is the
[01:09:48.440 --> 01:09:53.320]  state of the geopolitical jockeying right now well let me start with the
[01:09:53.320 --> 01:09:57.560]  desperation of the Anglo-American ruling class in other words the bankers of the
[01:09:57.560 --> 01:10:01.400]  city of London and the bankers of Wall Street along with some of these other
[01:10:01.400 --> 01:10:05.720]  places that you've you've mentioned they are desperate because we have a world
[01:10:05.720 --> 01:10:10.080]  economic depression right we have this massive 1.5 quadrillion dollars of
[01:10:10.080 --> 01:10:15.440]  toxic kited derivatives which are insolvent can't be paid and these are
[01:10:15.440 --> 01:10:19.600]  the forces of depression now the the main project that the London New York
[01:10:19.600 --> 01:10:26.400]  people had in the past eight ten twelve months was to try to unload those forces
[01:10:26.400 --> 01:10:31.160]  of depression against Europe and this was the big hedge fund attack on Greece
[01:10:31.160 --> 01:10:36.040]  Spain Portugal it was a concerted conspiratorial event by Britain up on
[01:10:36.040 --> 01:10:40.760]  the front page of the of the Wall Street Journal with various hedge funds
[01:10:40.760 --> 01:10:47.800]  including Soros including SAC including Einhorn of green light capital
[01:10:47.800 --> 01:10:52.880]  including Paulson and company and others and the idea was you could get a
[01:10:52.880 --> 01:10:57.040]  crisis going against the euro and I think the goal of that was to have a
[01:10:57.040 --> 01:11:02.040]  panic flight an actual collapse of the euro where we'd lose one third or one
[01:11:02.040 --> 01:11:07.760]  half or maybe more of its value in just a few days to have that in May some time
[01:11:07.760 --> 01:11:13.880]  the big lesson is that it has not worked so far at the euro is holding
[01:11:13.880 --> 01:11:19.360]  relatively steady the Europeans have done this phony bank stress test they the
[01:11:19.360 --> 01:11:23.840]  Europeans now think that they can survive and that leaves these forces of
[01:11:23.840 --> 01:11:28.800]  depression are going to go somewhere and they can go towards London they could
[01:11:28.800 --> 01:11:32.160]  go towards Tokyo I suppose so they could go towards China I don't think that's
[01:11:32.160 --> 01:11:36.800]  very likely the likely targets are once again London and New York and if it goes
[01:11:36.800 --> 01:11:41.080]  towards London remember there's that euro dollar market sitting in London so
[01:11:41.080 --> 01:11:45.320]  if London goes down the dollar begins to go down very rapidly we've already seen
[01:11:45.320 --> 01:11:49.880]  that starting but let me stop you for a moment from your research what are the
[01:11:49.880 --> 01:11:54.920]  power fissures because to have Merkel come out three months ago you're during
[01:11:54.920 --> 01:12:00.080]  the start of this and say criminal banks are doing this by design and to have
[01:12:00.080 --> 01:12:04.520]  these big brokerage firms admit they were doing it Europe supposedly allied
[01:12:04.520 --> 01:12:08.960]  with this whole new world order so this does look like desperation that the
[01:12:08.960 --> 01:12:13.880]  vampires are now trying to feed on their own brethren vampires yes well of course
[01:12:13.880 --> 01:12:17.520]  they always do that right it's always better my neighbor export the depression
[01:12:17.520 --> 01:12:21.960]  to the next guy and if you can hang on longer you can you can feast on his flesh
[01:12:21.960 --> 01:12:25.440]  and the big thing that the Germans did was the banning of the naked credit
[01:12:25.440 --> 01:12:30.160]  default swaps and the banning of many kinds of naked sales of a short
[01:12:30.160 --> 01:12:36.360]  short sales of stock but now if you can't save the dollar from a crash in the
[01:12:36.360 --> 01:12:42.520]  next six to twelve months say by dumping all of that into Europe and then
[01:12:42.520 --> 01:12:46.000]  essentially you know having a distressed merchandise sale in Europe and
[01:12:46.000 --> 01:12:50.920]  using that loot to prop up the dollar what can you do well this gets us back to
[01:12:50.920 --> 01:12:56.080]  1973 and the oil crisis of that year which was planned at the Bilderberger
[01:12:56.080 --> 01:13:00.160]  meeting in South Siobatan Sweden where they had presentations about the effect
[01:13:00.160 --> 01:13:05.600]  of a 400% rise in the price of oil and that gave rise to Henry Kissinger's
[01:13:05.600 --> 01:13:12.040]  Kipur war of October 1973 and a completely phony Arab oil boycott which
[01:13:12.040 --> 01:13:16.960]  never interrupted supplies but was used as a kind of a stunt a public relations
[01:13:16.960 --> 01:13:21.880]  event to allow the brokers to bid up the spot prices in the various commodity
[01:13:21.880 --> 01:13:27.800]  markets for oil around the world if you had an attack on Iran today the
[01:13:27.800 --> 01:13:32.760]  response of the Iranians would be some kind of attempted interdiction of the
[01:13:32.760 --> 01:13:37.040]  Gulf the Straits of Hormuz and things like this and ironically this would be
[01:13:37.040 --> 01:13:41.560]  exactly what the doctor ordered for the dollar because if you if you raise the
[01:13:41.560 --> 01:13:47.040]  price of oil from the current 75 or 80 or whatever it is if you can get that up
[01:13:47.040 --> 01:13:51.480]  to 500 or a thousand you create a tremendous demand for dollars there
[01:13:51.480 --> 01:13:56.080]  would be no dollar crisis for some time to come if you could get the price of
[01:13:56.080 --> 01:14:00.400]  oil up at that level and you can you can also see all of these wonderful
[01:14:00.400 --> 01:14:05.680]  Malfoozie and green jobs programs right all the wind energy the windmills and
[01:14:05.680 --> 01:14:09.800]  the solar cells and the electric cars things that are not economical today
[01:14:09.800 --> 01:14:14.120]  that require government subsidies would become economical they would become
[01:14:14.120 --> 01:14:18.800]  economically feasible in a course in the general context of complete
[01:14:18.800 --> 01:14:24.520]  immiserations so that would force the acceptance of the carbon tax well at
[01:14:24.520 --> 01:14:27.800]  that point you wouldn't even need a carbon tax because you'd be bringing it
[01:14:27.800 --> 01:14:31.200]  in through the price in other words that all of the people who want the carbon
[01:14:31.200 --> 01:14:35.800]  tax are trying to raise the price of energy because they hate energy they
[01:14:35.800 --> 01:14:39.880]  hate energy production they hate industry they hate technology science
[01:14:39.880 --> 01:14:43.040]  progress and by the way they say this they want to post industrial world
[01:14:43.040 --> 01:14:48.760]  because it's a finance system against true productivity and their entire
[01:14:48.760 --> 01:14:55.160]  Malfoozie and system so it appears the only move they've got is a attacking
[01:14:55.160 --> 01:15:00.800]  Iran and other nations and be staging domestic operations to try to stymie the
[01:15:00.800 --> 01:15:04.280]  populist movement that is voting out incumbents across the political
[01:15:04.280 --> 01:15:09.600]  spectrum yes and and and above all this idea of raising the price of oil which
[01:15:09.600 --> 01:15:13.000]  would be would for them be a godsend now there are a couple of other things that
[01:15:13.000 --> 01:15:18.640]  are going on the neocons were kicked out by and large from the bush cheney
[01:15:18.640 --> 01:15:24.080]  regime during 2007 and the landmark on that was that national intelligence
[01:15:24.080 --> 01:15:31.560]  estimate of December 2007 which said Iran has no repeat no nuclear weapons
[01:15:31.560 --> 01:15:35.560]  program they said that with high confidence now that was that meant that
[01:15:35.560 --> 01:15:40.880]  cheney essentially his goose was cooked that was his last gasp really of
[01:15:40.880 --> 01:15:44.640]  getting the war going with Iran now there's an attempt to come back and
[01:15:44.640 --> 01:15:49.680]  change that finding with a new national intelligence estimate which will of
[01:15:49.680 --> 01:15:55.560]  course now say we think that Iran does have a nuclear weapons program all
[01:15:55.560 --> 01:16:00.640]  kinds of signals on that coming from mrs. Clinton from Panetta from Gates the
[01:16:00.640 --> 01:16:04.560]  U.S. has actually been telling the other perm five members of the United
[01:16:04.560 --> 01:16:08.920]  Nations that this will be coming very soon and they they even say they won't
[01:16:08.920 --> 01:16:13.840]  publish the n.i.e. itself but they'll publish the findings which will simply be
[01:16:13.840 --> 01:16:19.440]  believe us trust us Iran has a nuclear weapons program behind this in turn the
[01:16:19.440 --> 01:16:23.800]  brzezinski group in kicking out the neocons had promised that they could
[01:16:23.800 --> 01:16:28.040]  take over Iran with the color revolutions but they fail solution of
[01:16:28.040 --> 01:16:32.360]  Musa V and it's failed now this has not gone anywhere so that that doesn't work
[01:16:32.360 --> 01:16:38.840]  you've also got the idea that Russian policy has become less stern less
[01:16:38.840 --> 01:16:44.400]  formidable let's say we now have this sort of dual power situation of Putin
[01:16:44.400 --> 01:16:49.520]  and Medvedev now Putin was of course a very tough customer and even though it
[01:16:49.520 --> 01:16:55.200]  was very unlikely that that Russia would with risk war for the sake of Iran there
[01:16:55.200 --> 01:16:58.880]  were plenty of things Russia could do to make life very uncomfortable for the
[01:16:58.880 --> 01:17:02.800]  Anglo-Americans in case of some kind of attack and just just the fact that the
[01:17:02.800 --> 01:17:07.720]  Russians we are no busty was for example one of the big sources for these
[01:17:07.720 --> 01:17:12.520]  things like operation bite which was the attack on Iran planned for a good
[01:17:12.520 --> 01:17:18.440]  Friday April 2007 and and similar things we also the visit of Putin to
[01:17:18.440 --> 01:17:23.040]  Akhmedinijad in October 2007 which was really pretty much at the height of the
[01:17:23.040 --> 01:17:28.520]  danger so there wasn't a deterrent effect by having a strong leader like
[01:17:28.520 --> 01:17:33.200]  Putin in in power now you have Medvedev Putin this is this is no longer
[01:17:33.200 --> 01:17:38.920]  functioning quite so well another big thing Petraeus the fact that the Obama
[01:17:38.920 --> 01:17:44.920]  counterinsurgency around the crystal failed and now we've got Petraeus Bush
[01:17:44.920 --> 01:17:50.400]  is general the king of the neocons the the probable neocon candidate for
[01:17:50.400 --> 01:17:55.920]  president in 2012 his power has become immense in the bureaucracy and if you
[01:17:55.920 --> 01:17:59.760]  look at the you know the literature you'll see that the central command
[01:17:59.760 --> 01:18:05.080]  under Petraeus planned an attack on Iran to the point where they now consider
[01:18:05.080 --> 01:18:09.040]  this plan to be mature right if you read this essay that I've written people say
[01:18:09.040 --> 01:18:13.000]  yes the cent com has now put it all together we didn't really have a plan
[01:18:13.000 --> 01:18:16.480]  in the past but now we have it because cent com did it and of course they did
[01:18:16.480 --> 01:18:20.880]  it during the time that Petraeus was there so the strengthening of the neocons
[01:18:20.880 --> 01:18:25.520]  with Petraeus this tremendous weakness of the Anglo-Americans because of the
[01:18:25.520 --> 01:18:29.480]  bankruptcy of the dollar and therefore their desire really for some kind of a
[01:18:29.480 --> 01:18:35.360]  of an event in the Middle East like 1973 the the failure of this green
[01:18:35.360 --> 01:18:39.520]  revolution there's also another thing which is that Hezbollah has been
[01:18:39.520 --> 01:18:43.960]  acquiring some rather sophisticated missiles they've got this thing called
[01:18:43.960 --> 01:18:49.520]  the M600 I believe it is which is something like 300 kilometers but it
[01:18:49.520 --> 01:18:54.160]  has a guidance system like the missiles that Hezbollah was using in the 2006
[01:18:54.160 --> 01:18:58.240]  Lebanon war which were they were essentially Russian World War why on
[01:18:58.240 --> 01:19:02.800]  earth would Hezbollah start another war and elicit an Israeli attack well they
[01:19:02.800 --> 01:19:07.680]  wouldn't they they this is this is part of a deterrent system in other words
[01:19:07.680 --> 01:19:11.920]  this you can think of Hezbollah as a kind of an aircraft carrier for for Iran
[01:19:11.920 --> 01:19:16.880]  close to the Israeli border and they're able to deliver this this deterrent
[01:19:16.880 --> 01:19:21.160]  in other words there's already a situation of conventional deterrent so
[01:19:21.160 --> 01:19:26.520]  Iran is pushed ahead with an with an array of four or five new medium range
[01:19:26.520 --> 01:19:31.000]  and intermediate range ballistic missiles the Shahabs and and others

[01:24:27.440 --> 01:24:34.840]  regime fiddle with cap and trade that's at tarpley.net Webster do you agree with
[01:24:34.840 --> 01:24:38.320]  Ahmed Denizia that it is green lighted it will happen the next three months or
[01:24:38.320 --> 01:24:42.080]  is he being made to believe that is there any way to avert this when is the
[01:24:42.080 --> 01:24:46.640]  attack on Iran coming and what will the aftermath be well I I'm not sure when
[01:24:46.640 --> 01:24:49.760]  he said this but depending on when he said it he might be agreeing with me
[01:24:49.760 --> 01:24:54.040]  because in this article that I put up Thursday of last week he said it
[01:24:54.040 --> 01:24:58.680]  yesterday and press TV. I speculated saying look I don't have any
[01:24:58.680 --> 01:25:02.600]  specific information but the one thing you know about these attacks is that they
[01:25:02.600 --> 01:25:06.240]  tend to occur in the dark of the moon right the new moon when there's no moon
[01:25:06.240 --> 01:25:12.120]  light because of the way that these stealth cruise missiles and planes you
[01:25:12.120 --> 01:25:14.680]  know if you can see them you can hit them but if you can't see them then it's
[01:25:14.680 --> 01:25:19.840]  very very hard and the the timetable of the new moon for the coming three months
[01:25:19.840 --> 01:25:25.440]  August 10th September 8th October 7th this I write at the end of that piece on
[01:25:25.440 --> 01:25:31.200]  the on Iran I found an article by Arnaud de Borsiglava an old adversary of mine
[01:25:31.200 --> 01:25:37.000]  I used to work for UPI now works for Newsmax and he says Obama would like to
[01:25:37.000 --> 01:25:42.320]  have three wars and if he has three wars he can have two houses of Congress
[01:25:42.320 --> 01:25:47.960]  still under his control which seems to be suggesting an October surprise so if
[01:25:47.960 --> 01:25:55.360]  you look at the October 7th date I have no way of knowing right but that could be
[01:25:55.360 --> 01:26:00.040]  a good guess or maybe not I don't know certainly when it when it happens right
[01:26:00.040 --> 01:26:05.160]  the Iranians have these missiles the Fajr the Shahab the gather the Ashura and
[01:26:05.160 --> 01:26:10.560]  the Fajr these are all 2,000 kilometers some of them have murbs they have
[01:26:10.560 --> 01:26:16.240]  multiple warheads and they've got more than 12,000 any ship missiles as well
[01:26:16.240 --> 01:26:20.480]  yes they do and the part however on Israel what I'm concerned about most
[01:26:20.480 --> 01:26:24.320]  is the ways that this could now go nuclear because there are such ways a
[01:26:24.320 --> 01:26:30.440]  guy writing in the Asia Times speculates that if you had Hezbollah firing
[01:26:30.440 --> 01:26:35.440]  first of all this spray of you know tens of thousands of Khatushkas that they
[01:26:35.440 --> 01:26:41.120]  have the Russian World War two vintage and putting among them these medium range
[01:26:41.120 --> 01:26:45.080]  ballistic missiles short range ballistic missiles that that has both on now
[01:26:45.080 --> 01:26:49.280]  seems to have maybe a hundred or 200 and if the Iranians were firing their
[01:26:49.280 --> 01:26:53.600]  conventional missiles at the same time they might be able to overwhelm the
[01:26:53.600 --> 01:26:58.560]  Israeli defense system now the Israelis have an ABM system which is layered and
[01:26:58.560 --> 01:27:04.360]  it's iron dome at the bottom then David Sting then Arrow and then the US made
[01:27:04.360 --> 01:27:11.000]  Patriot but again this is subjected to a complete barrage right salvos that are
[01:27:11.000 --> 01:27:15.960]  simultaneous well how are they gonna sell preemptively attacking Iran then Iran
[01:27:15.960 --> 01:27:21.800]  fires back and they're going to decry Iran fighting back I mean I this is
[01:27:21.800 --> 01:27:26.560]  insane well naturally they'll they'll do two things if Iran strikes against
[01:27:26.560 --> 01:27:31.440]  Israel they'll they'll demonize that of course and if Iran strikes against US
[01:27:31.440 --> 01:27:37.600]  spaces say in the United Arab Emirates or Saudi Arabia or Iraq they can they
[01:27:37.600 --> 01:27:41.640]  can demonize that and we know Iran does have sleeper teams everywhere
[01:27:41.640 --> 01:27:46.480]  and here's the other thing about it some time ago and I cite this in that
[01:27:46.480 --> 01:27:53.600]  article that you mentioned the scenario for US encirclement in in Iraq is it
[01:27:53.600 --> 01:27:58.120]  depends on this route Tampa right there's a very long supply line that goes
[01:27:58.120 --> 01:28:02.560]  from Kuwait city to the Baghdad region all of those other countries everybody
[01:28:02.560 --> 01:28:09.240]  else 35,000 NATO and other foreign non-US troops have all left if you had a
[01:28:09.240 --> 01:28:13.360]  decisive effort by the Iranians together with Muktada Sader of the Mahdi
[01:28:13.360 --> 01:28:17.200]  army to cut route Tampa to cut that supply line that could become very
[01:28:17.200 --> 01:28:21.280]  critical same thing in Afghanistan because the supply line has to go
[01:28:21.280 --> 01:28:25.520]  through Pakistan where the hostilities building you've also got the fact that the
[01:28:25.520 --> 01:28:35.720]  US has forces in a total of 11 countries to try to encircle Iran the 11 if you
[01:28:35.720 --> 01:28:40.160]  want to hear them Afghanistan well Iraq Afghanistan Turkey Pakistan Kuwait
[01:28:40.160 --> 01:28:45.840]  Azerbaijan Armenia Turkmenistan Saudi Arabia United Arab Emirates
[01:28:45.840 --> 01:28:51.960]  Kyrgyzstan their US bases in all of those now let's suppose instead of being a
[01:28:51.960 --> 01:28:56.400]  factor of strength that dispersal of forces and fragmentation of forces
[01:28:56.400 --> 01:29:04.120]  turns into a liability the standard response and I confirmed this with a
[01:29:04.120 --> 01:29:09.360]  US Navy captain of the submarine nuclear submarine fleet this past Sunday night
[01:29:09.360 --> 01:29:13.400]  he said he had been when he was in the service he was in a drill where the
[01:29:13.400 --> 01:29:20.040]  assumption was 35,000 US forces are surrounded and cut off in Iran or near
[01:29:20.040 --> 01:29:23.920]  Iran what do you do well the immediate the thing is you fire nuclear weapons
[01:29:23.920 --> 01:29:28.080]  immediately and similarly if you do anything with Pakistan Pakistan has
[01:29:28.080 --> 01:29:31.840]  nuclear weapons so I think we've got three ways it can go nuclear the
[01:29:31.840 --> 01:29:36.640]  Israelis go nuclear I know you've got to go but this is webster I know I know
[01:29:36.640 --> 01:29:39.880]  you got to go this is too important do a couple more minutes when they are with
[01:29:39.880 --> 01:29:42.840]  us on the other side and finish up what a bow on what you've been talking about
[01:29:42.840 --> 01:29:47.040]  and how this will unfold if they do strike Iran we're on the verge of World

[01:31:11.960 --> 01:31:16.240]  much power your electric company allows you to have it's true total government

[01:31:20.600 --> 01:31:24.640]  three in some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously overloaded and
[01:31:24.640 --> 01:31:29.240]  now new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem number four
[01:31:29.240 --> 01:31:33.360]  dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids every year thousands of

[01:33:34.960 --> 01:33:39.400]  States if they start an attack with Iran there will be real terror attacks not
[01:33:39.400 --> 01:33:43.560]  just stage ones in this country and they're gonna use that to come after you
[01:33:43.560 --> 01:33:48.560]  that's what this banking structure needs is an outside threat as a pretext to
[01:33:48.560 --> 01:33:52.640]  control our lives we've got to reach out to the military and police now ladies
[01:33:52.640 --> 01:33:57.400]  and gentlemen now before they shut the web off during a war like Lieberman
[01:33:57.400 --> 01:34:02.320]  told Candy Couric on CNN we're going back to Tarpley here briefly to finish up
[01:34:02.320 --> 01:34:06.120]  without this nuclear war could unfold it's not just Tarpley mainstream news
[01:34:06.120 --> 01:34:10.240]  mainstream analysts the Russian government are saying this could lead to
[01:34:10.240 --> 01:34:13.720]  nuclear war our own military says they're going to use nukes four years ago
[01:34:13.720 --> 01:34:17.400]  under Bush they had a plan to use quote small nukes so we'll talk about that with
[01:34:17.400 --> 01:34:22.920]  Tarpley in a moment and go to your phone calls Matt Seal David Dave Matt and
[01:34:22.920 --> 01:34:26.600]  others that are holding I first wanted to just point out to everybody that I do
[01:34:26.600 --> 01:34:30.040]  believe in being self-sufficient those of us that know what's happening
[01:34:30.040 --> 01:34:33.240]  understand the globalist want us to be dependent on them they want to shut off
[01:34:33.240 --> 01:34:37.520]  our resources to control us and bring us into this collective a system this
[01:34:37.520 --> 01:34:42.200]  corporate collectivist slave grid a full-spectrum dominance you need high
[01:34:42.200 --> 01:34:46.120]  quality storeable food the place to get it as e-foods direct com with all the
[01:34:46.120 --> 01:34:50.560]  problems of the economy looming war the gulf all of it you are insane if you
[01:34:50.560 --> 01:34:53.200]  don't get scoreable foods in my opinion and the place to get them as e-foods
[01:34:53.200 --> 01:34:58.720]  direct com that's e-foods direct com the letter e foods direct com or 800 409

[01:35:43.160 --> 01:35:51.840]  information packet 877 327 0365 that's 877 327 0365 my solar backup com okay
[01:35:51.840 --> 01:35:55.920]  Webster finishing up you were getting up to the point of nuclear weapons being
[01:35:55.920 --> 01:36:00.360]  used in the Bush administration four years ago said that's part of the scent
[01:36:00.360 --> 01:36:06.920]  com attack profile if Iran responds if Iran as much as fires an anti-aircraft
[01:36:06.920 --> 01:36:11.920]  weapon back at an aircraft they're going to be new to go ahead again I think you
[01:36:11.920 --> 01:36:17.000]  can see three ways one of them is with this Iran has Bola combination so far
[01:36:17.000 --> 01:36:23.360]  has Bola as we saw in 2006 has had a counter value strategy vis-a-vis Israel
[01:36:23.360 --> 01:36:27.560]  in other words they point these these rather crude rockets that a city hypha
[01:36:27.560 --> 01:36:31.440]  or some other place and they hope it's going to hit something so it's basically
[01:36:31.440 --> 01:36:37.040]  terror bombing of of cities but if you have more accurate missiles that can
[01:36:37.040 --> 01:36:42.480]  actually hit targets you can go over to a counter force strategy you can target
[01:36:42.480 --> 01:36:47.240]  the air bases of the Israeli Air Force and indeed I've seen things on the
[01:36:47.240 --> 01:36:51.880]  internet that the Israeli Air Force is ready to flee from northern Lebanon at
[01:36:51.880 --> 01:36:56.200]  the drop of a hat and take refuge in southern Israel because they now fear
[01:36:56.200 --> 01:37:02.080]  these 200 new missiles that the Hezbollah have been able to obtain and if
[01:37:02.080 --> 01:37:06.400]  you had this the simultaneous attack from Iran and from Hezbollah if they were
[01:37:06.400 --> 01:37:11.040]  targeting Israeli Air Force airfields including in the south of Israel this
[01:37:11.040 --> 01:37:15.640]  could put Israel into a very critical situation and naturally as as always as
[01:37:15.640 --> 01:37:19.400]  we had it in Europe during the Cold War if you're losing on the conventional
[01:37:19.400 --> 01:37:23.920]  plane and you have nuclear weapons then you get a tremendous temptation to go
[01:37:23.920 --> 01:37:27.680]  nuclear to escalate to the nuclear level thinking that you can solve your
[01:37:27.680 --> 01:37:32.520]  problems there so it could come through Israeli retaliation if they thought they
[01:37:32.520 --> 01:37:37.160]  were losing in a conventional way and the lesson of Lebanon 2006 was that they
[01:37:37.160 --> 01:37:42.160]  did lose in a conventional way second was by the US if the US forces are
[01:37:42.160 --> 01:37:48.320]  encircled anywhere Iraq Afghanistan or these total of 11 countries then nuclear
[01:37:48.320 --> 01:37:54.720]  forces might well that's always been the default going back to you know two man
[01:37:54.720 --> 01:38:00.440]  teams with things like Davy Crockett tacticals right and then Pakistan right
[01:38:00.440 --> 01:38:03.800]  any anything that if you're attacking Pakistan you have to remember that the
[01:38:03.800 --> 01:38:09.000]  US is deterred from directly attacking Pakistan or should be by the fact that
[01:38:09.000 --> 01:38:12.040]  Pakistan has nuclear weapons they can defend themselves that's why you have
[01:38:12.040 --> 01:38:16.640]  to do all this subversion with the help of WikiLeaks and others to it to get the
[01:38:16.640 --> 01:38:21.920]  Pakistanis going so you add this all together there are three ways that this
[01:38:21.920 --> 01:38:26.120]  could go nuclear I would also point to the fact that since I wrote this
[01:38:26.120 --> 01:38:31.600]  article General Hager the former head of the what if the NSA and he said the
[01:38:31.600 --> 01:38:35.440]  attack is inexorable it's inexorable and then we have to as you point to this
[01:38:35.440 --> 01:38:41.600]  this very suspicious Japanese tanker explosion coming what yesterday today
[01:38:41.600 --> 01:38:47.040]  they're now whitewashing that's saying a wave blew out a bulkhead and so who
[01:38:47.040 --> 01:38:50.960]  knows the truth it's hard to tell but we're now in a very very sensitive
[01:38:50.960 --> 01:38:56.640]  geometry and this could could happen at any point now and actually I I we had
[01:38:56.640 --> 01:39:02.160]  this anti-war national anti-war meeting in in Albany New York this past weekend
[01:39:02.160 --> 01:39:05.840]  and the one thing that they did come up with this was not a great gathering that
[01:39:05.840 --> 01:39:10.480]  the anti-war movement is in in bad shape but they did decide that there's a
[01:39:10.480 --> 01:39:16.400]  march on Washington for essentially an anti-war march run by the
[01:39:16.400 --> 01:39:21.040]  air for both CIO on October 2nd so that's obviously not going to be a very
[01:39:21.040 --> 01:39:24.000]  aggressive program it's probably probably going to be something they try to
[01:39:24.000 --> 01:39:29.360]  channel into supporting Democratic candidates for Congress obviously but
[01:39:29.360 --> 01:39:32.600]  still I think you can inject some stuff into that it's also interesting
[01:39:32.600 --> 01:39:37.480]  yesterday the Democrats in the House voted to there were about 102 of them I
[01:39:37.480 --> 01:39:41.160]  think that we voted to end the Afghanistan war pretty much right away
[01:39:41.160 --> 01:39:47.320]  which is an increase of 70 votes so there's a there's a gathering caucus of
[01:39:47.320 --> 01:39:51.320]  Democrats who are voting against Obama on one of his main issues because he
[01:39:51.320 --> 01:39:54.640]  campaigned for the presidency on the idea that he was going to escalate
[01:39:54.640 --> 01:39:59.800]  Afghanistan win and he was going to track down bin Laden so again my favorite
[01:39:59.800 --> 01:40:04.200]  slogan is you have two choices in life get active or get radioactive better to
[01:40:04.200 --> 01:40:07.800]  get active and better to do it now all right Webster Tarpoli will continue to
[01:40:07.800 --> 01:40:12.240]  watch these ominous developments thank you for spending time with us all right
[01:40:12.240 --> 01:40:15.600]  there he goes I'm going to take your phone calls now and try to go as quickly
[01:40:15.600 --> 01:40:20.200]  to each person as I can so we can get everybody on and then I want police and
[01:40:20.200 --> 01:40:23.720]  military out there to start their engines because when we start the second
[01:40:23.720 --> 01:40:28.520]  segment at eight after next hour I am going to take phone calls as quickly as
[01:40:28.520 --> 01:40:32.440]  possible but they're always intriguing from people like the gentleman that called
[01:40:32.440 --> 01:40:36.360]  a few days ago and said I was in Iraq in the army the Austin SWAT team was there
[01:40:36.360 --> 01:40:41.320]  learning from us how to shut down cities and confiscate guns for the United
[01:40:41.320 --> 01:40:45.560]  States then I searched the term and found the Fort Hood Sentinel admitting the
[01:40:45.560 --> 01:40:50.560]  SWAT team had been over there and that they had city officials learning how to
[01:40:50.560 --> 01:40:54.600]  lock things down at Fort Hood and from Austin I mean that's how criminal this
[01:40:54.600 --> 01:40:59.000]  city is and how treacherous and traitorous they are and then and then we had
[01:40:59.000 --> 01:41:03.560]  other callers yesterday saying yeah no I'm in Texas we train at a fusion center
[01:41:03.560 --> 01:41:07.720]  I train these people the military comes back they become law officers and
[01:41:07.720 --> 01:41:12.600]  they're being militarized and taught to the American people of their enemy so
[01:41:12.600 --> 01:41:17.000]  the entire architecture of this militarization of police is targeted at
[01:41:17.000 --> 01:41:20.560]  the American people and we have their internal memos and manuals you know
[01:41:20.560 --> 01:41:25.320]  about Mayak and others but none of this has to do with turban men that you know
[01:41:25.320 --> 01:41:29.080]  want to climb out from underneath your bed and suck your blood at night this is
[01:41:29.080 --> 01:41:33.680]  all for you to make sure this offshore banking cartel can really take over this
[01:41:33.680 --> 01:41:37.800]  country into the depression we're going so I want to say we're gonna take these
[01:41:37.800 --> 01:41:41.240]  calls right now but then starting the next hour we're leaving the phones open
[01:41:41.240 --> 01:41:45.240]  for police and military who've been part of this training or have concerns about
[01:41:45.240 --> 01:41:49.840]  it or people that have you know Joel Scalzen's got a great report out on this
[01:41:49.840 --> 01:41:53.600]  check Baldwin's got one top secret America the rest of story how they're
[01:41:53.600 --> 01:41:57.800]  training these black op cadres to kill the American people and this is all
[01:41:57.800 --> 01:42:01.720]  admitted they're not just training SWAT teams and military they're training
[01:42:01.720 --> 01:42:06.360]  Boy Scouts the LAPD is actually taken over the Explorer Scout program and in
[01:42:06.360 --> 01:42:11.080]  the drills on TV and in the newspapers they say to take on disgruntled vets and
[01:42:11.080 --> 01:42:17.240]  kill them I mean you cannot man in fact search engine for people right now
[01:42:17.240 --> 01:42:22.840]  Boy Scouts training to take on vets and then you can see the Newark Times
[01:42:22.840 --> 01:42:28.560]  photos of the images of the mock dead vets killed by the kids so I mean the
[01:42:28.560 --> 01:42:34.120]  real training on the basis left right left right it's for you remember that
[01:42:34.120 --> 01:42:37.920]  when they first induct somebody in a SWAT team or military the first drills
[01:42:37.920 --> 01:42:42.600]  are guys with turbines and you know they'll have these little events but
[01:42:42.600 --> 01:42:46.200]  then next it's by the way we're fighting Farmer Jones there it is
[01:42:46.200 --> 01:42:50.320]  government-ready's youth corps to take on vets that's the prison planet article
[01:42:50.320 --> 01:42:54.080]  but if you scroll down there'll be a link to the New York Times you can see
[01:42:54.080 --> 01:42:59.760]  all the photos and read all about it and they they say how how wonderful all of
[01:42:59.760 --> 01:43:06.480]  this is so this is what my film police state for the rise of FEMA covers and
[01:43:06.480 --> 01:43:10.400]  the article in the New York Times is Scouts trained to fight terrorists and
[01:43:10.400 --> 01:43:14.520]  more and the first line says the disgruntled vets angry he won't turn
[01:43:14.520 --> 01:43:20.080]  in the gun they send them in they take them out now there it is ten minutes
[01:43:20.080 --> 01:43:24.080]  into errant mayhem in the town near the Mexican border a gunman a disgruntled
[01:43:24.080 --> 01:43:28.640]  Iraq war veteran has already taken out two people one slumped on a desk the
[01:43:28.640 --> 01:43:32.120]  other covered in blood on the floor and folks I've seen the drills it's been in
[01:43:32.120 --> 01:43:35.920]  the news in Michigan where they practice taking on homeschooling families and
[01:43:35.920 --> 01:43:40.160]  killing you I mean that's AP I could pull it up right now I mean you can't
[01:43:40.160 --> 01:43:44.240]  make up the diabolical nature this has happened in every other country when
[01:43:44.240 --> 01:43:47.800]  nations go bad this is what happens all right I'm gonna shut up and go to your
[01:43:47.800 --> 01:43:51.760]  calls that's coming up next hour let me give the police officers and military
[01:43:51.760 --> 01:43:55.080]  people who want to give us their comments on this or any intel the number
[01:43:55.080 --> 01:43:59.560]  one eight hundred two five nine ninety two thirty one eight hundred two five
[01:43:59.560 --> 01:44:03.320]  nine nine two three one this will be informative Matt in Georgia you're on
[01:44:03.320 --> 01:44:09.560]  the air hey how you doing out good sir hey actually my main thing is on Iran but
[01:44:09.560 --> 01:44:14.760]  but I am military and I got a tip for you you can search you can Google or you
[01:44:14.760 --> 01:44:18.680]  can put into YouTube they actually have their personal video up the system we
[01:44:18.680 --> 01:44:23.600]  were trying to use it's called the hide that's H double ID what it is is a
[01:44:23.600 --> 01:44:28.680]  small camera they use it in theater but but we were told that this is going to
[01:44:28.680 --> 01:44:32.200]  be used everywhere this is not just in the United States this is a global thing
[01:44:32.200 --> 01:44:38.800]  they can upload about 40,000 iris scans and face scans and fingerprint scans
[01:44:38.800 --> 01:44:43.280]  into the camera itself and they're working on expanding this so basically
[01:44:43.280 --> 01:44:47.240]  what you do is you go in you gather biometric data at any place that you
[01:44:47.240 --> 01:44:52.000]  go and it also has a function so you can put the last place this person was
[01:44:52.000 --> 01:44:56.360]  spotted so the idea was that what they were spotted in say Basra and then you
[01:44:56.360 --> 01:45:00.680]  see him again into crit then you would say well why are you into crit so it's
[01:45:00.680 --> 01:45:05.160]  a it's a system that yeah for those that don't know I saw earlier generations of
[01:45:05.160 --> 01:45:09.280]  this it's in police state 2000 where they're practicing putting the San
[01:45:09.280 --> 01:45:11.920]  Franciscans they say where are you from I'm from San Francisco where'd you get
[01:45:11.920 --> 01:45:16.360]  the weapon and they iris scan you they enroll you into this and in Fallujah if
[01:45:16.360 --> 01:45:19.840]  you don't have the ID card that goes with this Tom Brokaw one of his last
[01:45:19.840 --> 01:45:23.760]  broadcast said like it was good you were executed on the spot I mean that's an
[01:45:23.760 --> 01:45:28.240]  amazing but that was on NBC nightly news and there is the L1 identity solutions
[01:45:28.240 --> 01:45:32.960]  hide system the police are now getting this all over the country and your
[01:45:32.960 --> 01:45:38.880]  digital photo the face-scanning cameras this is the secret weapon a year ago
[01:45:38.880 --> 01:45:45.920]  written about by Washington Post writer who of course was a part of the you know
[01:45:45.920 --> 01:45:52.840]  going after Nixon and he what's his name it'll pop my head in a second who's the
[01:45:52.840 --> 01:46:00.440]  famous writer now what no it's not for us no it's not Cy Hirsch who were the two
[01:46:00.440 --> 01:46:06.520]  I have one of those moments who are the two famous people that did Watergate
[01:46:06.520 --> 01:46:11.640]  Bob Woodward Bob Woodward Bob Woodward Bob Woodward these are the secret weapons
[01:46:11.640 --> 01:46:14.640]  and they're on the cameras on the light poles everywhere I'm gonna shut up go
[01:46:14.640 --> 01:46:19.240]  ahead and tell folks about the hide that the beast tracking control grip right
[01:46:19.240 --> 01:46:24.160]  yes basically they take the other thumbprint iris scan face scan and you
[01:46:24.160 --> 01:46:29.360]  know they said that this is supposed to be a global system I also saw a news
[01:46:29.360 --> 01:46:33.680]  clip also on YouTube that they're already integrating this in Colorado and
[01:46:33.680 --> 01:46:38.440]  they're using it for they said routine traffic stops every now and then they
[01:46:38.440 --> 01:46:41.960]  have face-scanning cameras and thumbprint readers going in all over the
[01:46:41.960 --> 01:46:46.160]  country most departments don't tell the slave public this but they have units
[01:46:46.160 --> 01:46:50.240]  with the license plate scanners it gets here and it's going to be used against
[01:46:50.240 --> 01:46:55.400]  citizens illegal aliens will be above the law but actually my main thing the
[01:46:55.400 --> 01:46:59.400]  reason I called was I'm looking at Kurt Nemo's article possible false flag on
[01:46:59.400 --> 01:47:03.640]  the Japanese tanker and I think there's something that we miss a lot of times
[01:47:03.640 --> 01:47:08.400]  when we when we look at something like the trilateral commission is we always
[01:47:08.400 --> 01:47:10.960]  think of Europe in the United States well there's the third leg which is
[01:47:10.960 --> 01:47:15.640]  Japan if you look at who owns a tanker it's Mitsui which was a a backer the
[01:47:15.640 --> 01:47:19.360]  fascist regime in World War two was what was one of what was called the
[01:47:19.360 --> 01:47:23.520]  Saibatsu which was one of the monopolies they're closely tied to the royal family
[01:47:23.520 --> 01:47:28.640]  in Japan and it's also a bank Mitsui is the largest bank in Japan it's one of
[01:47:28.640 --> 01:47:35.520]  the largest in the world so when they voted out the LDP prime minister earlier
[01:47:35.520 --> 01:47:39.400]  and they put Hato Yaman who was from the Democratic Party which was this is
[01:47:39.400 --> 01:47:44.000]  only the second time since World War two that the LDP's been out of control and
[01:47:44.000 --> 01:47:48.560]  they've only been out control for probably two years during the past 50 but
[01:47:48.560 --> 01:47:53.920]  he came in saying he was gonna you know scale down US bases he wasn't gonna
[01:47:53.920 --> 01:47:58.400]  militarize remilitarized Japan which has been a big push especially with
[01:47:58.400 --> 01:48:03.080]  the former prime minister suddenly the ship gets blown up in South Korea and
[01:48:03.080 --> 01:48:08.120]  World War three is being talked about exactly and as well if you look at
[01:48:08.120 --> 01:48:11.840]  Afghanistan when they when they announced all these mineral riches
[01:48:11.840 --> 01:48:17.800]  Karzai visited Japan and said that Japan has first debt so there's a lot of
[01:48:17.800 --> 01:48:21.800]  pull from from different directions the big their big problem is is that the
[01:48:21.800 --> 01:48:25.720]  Japanese public they really they like the fact that their constitution says
[01:48:25.720 --> 01:48:30.280]  that they can't operate militarily outside their country if they do all they
[01:48:30.280 --> 01:48:35.320]  can do is is basically drive trucks or deliver food a long time as the word is
[01:48:35.320 --> 01:48:40.960]  from good sources that for the last 15 years China has Japan because of the
[01:48:40.960 --> 01:48:45.920]  threat of China and North Korea has been rearming right they now have the fifth
[01:48:45.920 --> 01:48:50.760]  largest military in the world but they won't cross that certain line they
[01:48:50.760 --> 01:48:54.720]  try to put those troops in Iraq and and the public wouldn't stand for it they
[01:48:54.720 --> 01:48:58.280]  were trying to get him into Afghanistan the most they could do is provide some
[01:48:58.280 --> 01:49:05.800]  resupply ships off post-apakistan to resupply america but now there's a big
[01:49:05.800 --> 01:49:10.200]  push again and and there's no reason why Iran would attack a Japanese ship I
[01:49:10.200 --> 01:49:15.480]  mean if you remember just that they're selling oil in Japanese yen so they've
[01:49:15.480 --> 01:49:19.600]  always had a favorable opinion of the Japanese who knows there would be
[01:49:19.600 --> 01:49:24.240]  suicide Matt who knows what the truth is I appreciate your great points and yes
[01:49:24.240 --> 01:49:28.320]  face scanning is coming to everywhere you'll need it to buy and sell with a
[01:49:28.320 --> 01:49:33.600]  national sales tax this is the public plan and the churches won't tell you
[01:49:33.600 --> 01:49:37.560]  and if America doesn't get serious and get focused and get concerned the rest
[01:49:37.560 --> 01:49:42.120]  the planet doesn't get serious and concerned and say no to all of this we
[01:49:42.120 --> 01:49:48.640]  are in for very horrible times seal in Canada you're on the air thank you very
[01:49:48.640 --> 01:49:52.960]  much general Jones general Jones I should say and thank you for your your
[01:49:52.960 --> 01:49:58.160]  comments to mr. Tarpley dr. Tarpley I want to say that those resources over
[01:49:58.160 --> 01:50:01.640]  there in Afghanistan they get awful expensive I would say I think it's
[01:50:01.640 --> 01:50:05.120]  about time that all these other people around here that are sitting in their
[01:50:05.120 --> 01:50:08.920]  cold water sitting on the burner like a frog like a bunch of frogs they better
[01:50:08.920 --> 01:50:12.600]  wake up and start doing something about it you know it's always after the war
[01:50:12.600 --> 01:50:15.920]  that we say oh that was too expensive well it's going to be expensive if we
[01:50:15.920 --> 01:50:20.400]  don't do something about it these power mongers at the top you know you know
[01:50:20.400 --> 01:50:25.680]  like you said yesterday Alex Jones they themselves are beasts you know just like
[01:50:25.680 --> 01:50:30.000]  it says in the Bible and God requires that which is past can't we learn from
[01:50:30.000 --> 01:50:35.680]  the past these wars are too expensive we're going under tyranny here
[01:50:36.680 --> 01:50:40.560]  seal good to hear from you but that's what's sick about it we pay for the war
[01:50:40.560 --> 01:50:45.440]  the corporations get the resources and then we go into debt to the very same
[01:50:45.440 --> 01:50:49.440]  bankers that own those corporations and the public doesn't get wise it's over
[01:50:49.440 --> 01:50:52.800]  you're all going to be basically bankrupt they mean a total hardcore

[01:54:25.760 --> 01:54:30.600]  wanted to see what you thought of this I think the best way to wake people up is
[01:54:30.600 --> 01:54:34.680]  is being able to show them documents that proof they really can't argue with
[01:54:34.680 --> 01:54:37.720]  that and I was wondering what you thought of maybe getting up on your site
[01:54:37.720 --> 01:54:43.120]  just a place that's just concentrated documents white papers admissions by the
[01:54:43.120 --> 01:54:47.640]  global elite about things like fluoride in the water things like that well sir
[01:54:47.640 --> 01:54:55.920]  we publish articles every week that you know have the union for the EPA with 90
[01:54:55.920 --> 01:55:00.840]  plus percent of their scientists coming out and saying sodium fluorides deadly
[01:55:00.840 --> 01:55:05.320]  and under that name fluoride they're adding hundreds of chemicals like arsenic
[01:55:05.320 --> 01:55:09.000]  lead mercury to the water I mean you can show them the Washington Post saying
[01:55:09.000 --> 01:55:12.560]  half of corn syrup products at high levels of mercury in them you can show
[01:55:12.560 --> 01:55:16.520]  them hundreds of news articles admitting aspartame's causing women to have
[01:55:16.520 --> 01:55:20.480]  miscarriages and low birth weights and deformities I mean it's admitted that
[01:55:20.480 --> 01:55:24.480]  prozac causes brain damage and I mean that's now even on the news I mean I

[01:57:27.320 --> 01:57:31.680]  fellow reserve is given total control over the economy so the very banks that

[02:00:32.200 --> 02:00:34.800]  talk about whether they think this country's turning into a police state
[02:00:34.800 --> 02:00:38.000]  do they understand they're being trained for war against the American people
[02:00:38.000 --> 02:00:42.200]  had a lot of amazing calls yesterday but we got some bad news we knew it was
[02:00:42.200 --> 02:00:45.560]  coming with this judge's history now it'll go on to the full ninth circuit
[02:00:45.560 --> 02:00:51.080]  Fox News reports federal judge blocks part of Arizona immigration law federal
[02:00:51.080 --> 02:00:54.880]  judge today blocked some of the toughest provisions the Arizona immigration law
[02:00:54.880 --> 02:00:58.600]  putting a hole in the state's attempt to have local police enforce federal
[02:00:58.600 --> 02:01:03.160]  immigration policy a federal judge on Wednesday blocks some of the toughest
[02:01:03.160 --> 02:01:06.080]  provisions the Arizona immigration law putting on hold the state's attempt to
[02:01:06.080 --> 02:01:09.280]  have local police and force federal immigration policy so that's kind of
[02:01:09.280 --> 02:01:12.040]  like saying local police if they catch somebody committing a federal crime
[02:01:12.040 --> 02:01:16.640]  you're not supposed to arrest them this is the lawlessness the criminality do
[02:01:16.640 --> 02:01:21.080]  understand what it means to have a criminal rogue government none of us are
[02:01:21.080 --> 02:01:28.680]  safe it's like Russia or China or other tyrannies do you know what this means
[02:01:29.040 --> 02:01:33.640]  though the rest of the law is still to get into effect Thursday the partial
[02:01:33.640 --> 02:01:37.640]  section of SB 1070 means Arizona for the time being will not be able to require
[02:01:37.640 --> 02:01:40.760]  police officers to determine the immigration status of anyone they stop
[02:01:40.760 --> 02:01:47.280]  or arrest so we'll talk more about this coming up but right now let's go back
[02:01:47.280 --> 02:01:52.160]  to your calls Matt he's talked to Matt David in Virginia you're on the air
[02:01:52.160 --> 02:01:56.960]  hi Alex good to see you a little context here I also am a radio guy do
[02:01:56.960 --> 02:02:01.160]  mid-days on a Cox radio station in Richmond Virginia started when I was 21
[02:02:01.160 --> 02:02:05.400]  right at UNC Chapel Hill like you I cannot believe you were pression enough
[02:02:05.400 --> 02:02:09.920]  at the age of 21 to figure this out when nobody was talking about it a lot of my
[02:02:09.920 --> 02:02:15.120]  colleagues look to you as sort of like the guy on high as opposed to maybe a
[02:02:15.120 --> 02:02:20.120]  rush whom they view as kind of pompous and a blow-hard having said that here
[02:02:20.120 --> 02:02:24.520]  are two quick questions if you're a contrarian could anybody make the case
[02:02:24.520 --> 02:02:28.800]  that because the whole world is saying you know Obama needs something you know
[02:02:28.800 --> 02:02:33.240]  around a 9-11 sort of thing in order to save himself every newspaper everywhere
[02:02:33.240 --> 02:02:36.760]  around the world is there any chance speaking from a contrarian standpoint as
[02:02:36.760 --> 02:02:41.040]  people do these would be the stock market that it might not happen because of
[02:02:41.040 --> 02:02:46.440]  that well it it might not happen if they think they're gonna get caught doing it
[02:02:46.440 --> 02:02:50.600]  and if they know enough people are aware of false flag terror stage terror
[02:02:50.600 --> 02:02:56.120]  self-inflicted wounds but it's part of their arrogance that when all these
[02:02:56.120 --> 02:02:59.200]  government officials people like Gary Hart and others say the government
[02:02:59.200 --> 02:03:03.640]  stages terror attacks you better do what we say Iran will stage one and attack
[02:03:03.640 --> 02:03:06.880]  you you know he wrote a public letter saying that three years ago they think
[02:03:06.880 --> 02:03:10.880]  you're so stupid that they operate right out in the open I was smart enough at
[02:03:10.880 --> 02:03:17.280]  age 21 to already be on air not because I was that smart but because I happen to
[02:03:17.280 --> 02:03:22.280]  read nonfiction history for entertainment from about the age of 12
[02:03:22.280 --> 02:03:28.240]  and so if you studied Hitler Stalin Mao Julius Caesar you knew what you were
[02:03:28.240 --> 02:03:33.120]  seeing those that don't know history doomed to repeat it I have read the
[02:03:33.120 --> 02:03:37.960]  classic historical works rise and decline of Roman Empire Gibbon others
[02:03:37.960 --> 02:03:43.320]  shares rise and fall of the Third Reich hobbles order of the death's head and
[02:03:43.320 --> 02:03:50.160]  others so I knew exactly what was going on and then by the time I was 21 I
[02:03:50.160 --> 02:03:53.520]  already started going to library and reading legislation government
[02:03:53.520 --> 02:03:57.520]  documents and I saw these world leaders admitting world government was being
[02:03:57.520 --> 02:04:02.000]  established then I turn on CNN they'd say dangerous terrorist talk about world
[02:04:02.000 --> 02:04:07.080]  government and I said boy I better get on air and then in 95 I was watching
[02:04:07.080 --> 02:04:11.680]  right when I got on air look newscasts of Oklahoma that local patriots are
[02:04:11.680 --> 02:04:17.920]  playing on access TV where they were removing the bombs and had been bombs
[02:04:17.920 --> 02:04:23.080]  inside so and I saw Clinton come out and demonized patriots with it I mean it
[02:04:23.080 --> 02:04:27.280]  was it was a Reichstag event I knew Hitler fire bombed the Capitol I knew
[02:04:27.280 --> 02:04:31.800]  Clinton had blown up Oklahoma City and so I mean it's just history if you know
[02:04:31.800 --> 02:04:35.040]  history you already know humans do the same things over and over again
[02:04:35.040 --> 02:04:40.840]  anything else David yeah one more question here um do you think this
[02:04:40.840 --> 02:04:45.320]  Gulf oil thing really is over I'm not gonna have the feeling you know for the
[02:04:45.320 --> 02:04:49.920]  get-go it was gonna be this mega event and skeptical of the fact that it really
[02:04:49.920 --> 02:04:55.400]  is quote-unquote over it I'm glad you say that in the BBC the CEO of BP says
[02:04:55.400 --> 02:04:59.120]  it's probably not over in fact I've got that in my stack let me try to dig that
[02:04:59.120 --> 02:05:04.960]  out the rideback thousands of Americans are facing evacuation if you or any of

[02:07:07.280 --> 02:07:11.560]  double or triple your electric bill number two our new energies are wants to
[02:07:11.560 --> 02:07:15.400]  control how much power your electric company allows you to have it's true
[02:07:15.400 --> 02:07:19.000]  total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid
[02:07:19.000 --> 02:07:23.600]  technology is coming number three in some areas of the country the power grid is
[02:07:23.600 --> 02:07:27.640]  dangerously overloaded and now new socialist legislation is only
[02:07:27.640 --> 02:07:31.400]  compounding the problem number four dangerous weather is always a threat to
[02:07:31.400 --> 02:07:35.040]  local grids every year thousands of families lose their power from weather

[02:08:12.960 --> 02:08:20.480]  he he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas
[02:08:20.480 --> 02:08:27.960]  Alex Jones we are now into our number three of the syndicated radio
[02:08:27.960 --> 02:08:33.600]  transmission on screen at prison planet dot TV for prison planet dot TV viewers
[02:08:33.600 --> 02:08:42.880]  wish to not just listen but actually watch incoming BP CEO thinks but can't
[02:08:42.880 --> 02:08:47.360]  guarantee oil flow has ended now since they reportedly capped it two weeks ago
[02:08:47.360 --> 02:08:51.960]  there's oil in a two-mile area coming out of all these other fishers clearly it
[02:08:51.960 --> 02:08:59.040]  cracked down beneath the surface in the 80 plus days of it leaking and it is now
[02:08:59.040 --> 02:09:04.960]  still leaking and remember three separate times before that they had said
[02:09:04.960 --> 02:09:08.160]  that they had capped it and then a week or two later admitted that it wasn't
[02:09:08.160 --> 02:09:11.040]  capped in some cases just a few days later they would have been it hadn't been
[02:09:11.040 --> 02:09:14.960]  capped he says I think no guarantees but I believe there will be no more oil
[02:09:14.960 --> 02:09:21.720]  flowing into the Gulf as of the 15th of July Dudley told CNN's America morning
[02:09:21.720 --> 02:09:25.240]  that's when I think they capped it was a few weeks ago this is a new interview he
[02:09:25.240 --> 02:09:29.240]  did last night no anomalies or breaches have been detected at the well and
[02:09:29.240 --> 02:09:32.800]  pressure is rising slowly indicating that it is structurally sound and has
[02:09:32.800 --> 02:09:38.120]  integrity BP shed Wednesday so I hope that is the case but all the other
[02:09:38.120 --> 02:09:41.480]  reports are there's all these fishers everywhere leaking and they say oh well
[02:09:41.480 --> 02:09:46.480]  that's another oil well then many many miles away a barge had another oil well
[02:09:46.480 --> 02:09:51.000]  and it's caused a big leak all of that information is up on info wars.com and
[02:09:51.000 --> 02:09:54.560]  prisonplanet.com one other big announcement this wasn't really a
[02:09:54.560 --> 02:09:59.840]  surprise federal judge blocks part of Arizona immigration law says they can't
[02:09:59.840 --> 02:10:03.240]  ask you if you're any legal alien of course if you're a citizen they can ask
[02:10:03.240 --> 02:10:07.040]  for your papers and ask you where you're going and try to demand to search your
[02:10:07.040 --> 02:10:10.400]  vehicle which violates the Bill of Rights but if you're a legal alien you're
[02:10:10.400 --> 02:10:15.960]  talking to a god and you can't ask them federal judge blocks part of Arizona
[02:10:15.960 --> 02:10:20.400]  immigration law this is a lawless government that selectively enforces
[02:10:20.400 --> 02:10:24.600]  unconstitutional laws against the people but leaves the illegal aliens alone
[02:10:24.600 --> 02:10:28.280]  because they want that voting block and they want to drive down the wages this
[02:10:28.280 --> 02:10:32.440]  is an F10 gap this is globalization it's further destroyed Mexico and is
[02:10:32.440 --> 02:10:37.200]  destroying this country Al Gore told you it was a great deal he told Larry King
[02:10:37.200 --> 02:10:42.240]  this is a great deal Larry they have a clip of that in my film fall the
[02:10:42.240 --> 02:10:48.360]  Republic you know it to be a fraud all right for the balance of the hour I'm
[02:10:48.360 --> 02:10:52.400]  going to talk to military well first let me finish these two calls that are
[02:10:52.400 --> 02:10:56.480]  ahead of Scott Chris and others but as we let callers go that's a chance for
[02:10:56.480 --> 02:11:00.880]  military and police to call in and talk about what's confirmed military being
[02:11:00.880 --> 02:11:04.400]  dispatched all over the country to run checkpoints against the citizens they
[02:11:04.400 --> 02:11:07.960]  call them crime checkpoints drug checkpoints drunk driving checkpoints
[02:11:07.960 --> 02:11:13.320]  it's all illegal at the threat fusion centers the military is being trained to
[02:11:13.320 --> 02:11:19.120]  confiscate guns to take on the American people for riot control and I've got
[02:11:19.120 --> 02:11:22.760]  some key intel on this we're going to be covering coming up but right now let's
[02:11:22.760 --> 02:11:26.760]  finish up quickly with Daryl and George then on to Scott Chris and others the
[02:11:26.760 --> 02:11:29.800]  toll-free number for military and police to call in who disagree with me who
[02:11:29.800 --> 02:11:36.240]  agree who have concerns who are our commanders people called in folks that
[02:11:36.240 --> 02:11:41.240]  are training these people because the American people can read this in the
[02:11:41.240 --> 02:11:45.040]  news now but it's being spun as if it's good it's important to actually hear
[02:11:45.040 --> 02:11:48.760]  from the people involved in it how real this is and remember how every other
[02:11:48.760 --> 02:11:52.240]  country's fallen corrupt government gets in they use the military and police
[02:11:52.240 --> 02:11:56.960]  against the people most nations are under this and where you have this system
[02:11:56.960 --> 02:12:00.640]  in place you have poverty and enslavement they put this in place
[02:12:00.640 --> 02:12:03.800]  because the government's getting ready to rob everybody with taxes and
[02:12:03.800 --> 02:12:09.160]  regulations I mean we know what this is in history this is bad and they give
[02:12:09.160 --> 02:12:12.880]  these false narratives and these compartmentalized programs to the
[02:12:12.880 --> 02:12:16.400]  police and military and then they graduate them through these different
[02:12:16.400 --> 02:12:20.080]  schools psychologically profiling them until they have different cadres
[02:12:20.080 --> 02:12:24.960]  including killers with badges who think it's macho and tough and that the
[02:12:24.960 --> 02:12:28.200]  American people are their enemy and they're these real warriors when they
[02:12:28.200 --> 02:12:33.120]  pull your wife and kids over this is the conversion of our police and military
[02:12:33.120 --> 02:12:39.080]  into servants of evil it's happening you can't deny it Daryl in Texas you're
[02:12:39.080 --> 02:12:45.400]  on the air Alex I I just wanted to comment and say that I work at a
[02:12:45.400 --> 02:12:50.160]  hospital very large hospital in central Texas and what we are seeing I'm a
[02:12:50.160 --> 02:12:53.960]  pharmacist and what we're seeing is difficulty in the supply chain and
[02:12:53.960 --> 02:12:59.480]  getting certain sizes of vial than ampules of certain medication now I've
[02:12:59.480 --> 02:13:02.480]  talked to some of the older pharmacists that were around in the Gulf War and
[02:13:02.480 --> 02:13:05.440]  they said they saw the same thing leading up to the Gulf War these
[02:13:05.440 --> 02:13:09.880]  medications are listed as follows they are dextrose injections they are
[02:13:09.880 --> 02:13:14.080]  calcium injections they are epinephrine injections they are certain sizes of
[02:13:14.080 --> 02:13:20.080]  morphine and fentanyl vials they are bicarbonate and so these are drugs
[02:13:20.080 --> 02:13:23.920]  that are used in what's called the crash carts or the cardiac arrest
[02:13:23.920 --> 02:13:29.720]  situations the trauma situations and there are only certain vial sizes the
[02:13:29.720 --> 02:13:33.880]  smaller dose vial sizes that would typically be used in combat we have a
[02:13:33.880 --> 02:13:38.800]  very large hospital that has a far reach as far as getting supplies another
[02:13:38.800 --> 02:13:44.400]  medication is propofol that is a medication used to sedate people it's a
[02:13:44.400 --> 02:13:49.160]  very favorite medication in the hospital to sedate somebody who's had
[02:13:49.160 --> 02:13:53.360]  their arms and legs blown off of their face blown off they have drugs to
[02:13:53.360 --> 02:13:57.280]  minimize the effects of a chemical weapon attack and the reports are
[02:13:57.280 --> 02:14:01.240]  ammunition drugs it's all drying up I've even seen this in the mainstream news
[02:14:01.240 --> 02:14:05.440]  ahead of the Iran attack which will probably lead to World War three then
[02:14:05.440 --> 02:14:10.600]  we'll all be patriotic and roll over to the bankers and let the stasi secret
[02:14:10.600 --> 02:14:16.840]  police grid take over 854,000 private spies now running America this is a
[02:14:16.840 --> 02:14:22.280]  criminal takeover yes sir but I just want to I want to report that we are
[02:14:22.280 --> 02:14:26.240]  seeing difficulties I mean all indications look like we are definitely
[02:14:26.240 --> 02:14:33.160]  on on the precipice we're gonna get a war so I appreciate all the work you do
[02:14:33.160 --> 02:14:36.040]  and I'll just ballot at that point I just want to report that we're seeing
[02:14:36.040 --> 02:14:39.080]  we're seeing that a difficult in supply alright thank you Daryl we're gonna
[02:14:39.080 --> 02:14:42.640]  finish up with George and nothing but military and police after that we've
[02:14:42.640 --> 02:14:45.920]  got Scott Chris and others holding let's talk to George in Connecticut you're
[02:14:45.920 --> 02:14:51.000]  on the air Alex I'm just wondering why don't we take this right there
[02:14:51.000 --> 02:14:56.080]  home they seem to have these huge meetings with all the security I know
[02:14:56.080 --> 02:15:00.600]  we're happy to leave men live some I live a stone's throw away I know we're
[02:15:00.600 --> 02:15:06.040]  president a former president Clinton lives I saw him walking his dog if we
[02:15:06.040 --> 02:15:10.240]  put up signs around them this will unnerve them because they I agree it's
[02:15:10.240 --> 02:15:14.040]  all psychological warfare against them we have the truth they have the line
[02:15:14.040 --> 02:15:19.440]  putting up signs where they live that we know you're a traitor Clinton protesting
[02:15:19.440 --> 02:15:25.000]  them the power of all of my listeners making simple political messages with
[02:15:25.000 --> 02:15:30.520]  websites and putting them on telephone polls is is incredible it's it's
[02:15:30.520 --> 02:15:34.400]  everybody doing a little bit we've got to identify them as illegitimate and
[02:15:34.400 --> 02:15:39.240]  criminal so that all their support dissipates and so we can take the nation
[02:15:39.240 --> 02:15:44.840]  back this is red-level emergency and I agree with you George what one other
[02:15:44.840 --> 02:15:48.360]  quick thing I've heard something on several places that this guy was talking
[02:15:48.360 --> 02:15:53.120]  about that the state of California is now a corporate state they put it all
[02:15:53.120 --> 02:15:58.360]  under corporate and certain states have been fighting against the legal actions
[02:15:58.360 --> 02:16:02.360]  because they put individuals as a corporation all in cap letters if this
[02:16:02.360 --> 02:16:07.040]  is true if this is a legal mechanism basically they've made themselves in a
[02:16:07.040 --> 02:16:11.800]  legal organization like a government organization they're no longer a
[02:16:11.800 --> 02:16:15.840]  government organization they're a corporate cryptocracy already and if
[02:16:15.840 --> 02:16:19.560]  there's a legal mind out there that can figure this out we might be able to
[02:16:19.560 --> 02:16:23.760]  unseat them and start our own parallel gold government that is the legitimate
[02:16:23.760 --> 02:16:26.400]  government rather than a corporate government that's basically trying to
[02:16:26.400 --> 02:16:29.760]  subvert our rights all right God bless you I appreciate your call we're gonna
[02:16:29.760 --> 02:16:35.160]  go to break and go directly to Scott Chris Greg's DoD contractor we're gonna
[02:16:35.160 --> 02:16:39.680]  talk to everybody and I we had a trainer in Texas who trains the MJTF
[02:16:39.680 --> 02:16:43.120]  threat fusion centers and he said everything you're saying is true Alex
[02:16:43.120 --> 02:16:46.720]  it's total martial law preparation they're teaching them they're hardcore
[02:16:46.720 --> 02:16:50.800]  warriors and their enemy is us and that's for the inner cadres the outer
[02:16:50.800 --> 02:16:54.440]  cadres do they think are good men and women aren't brought into that we're
[02:16:54.440 --> 02:16:57.440]  gonna be discussing it all after this break but I wanted to go to Chuck Baldwin's
[02:16:57.440 --> 02:17:05.680]  top secret America the rest of the story and it gets into 854,000 private secret
[02:17:05.680 --> 02:17:10.480]  police with the highest security levels you've got the clergy response teams
[02:17:10.480 --> 02:17:14.880]  preachers being paid secretly to brainwash their flocks I mean that's
[02:17:14.880 --> 02:17:18.920]  right out of a science fiction movie folks that's so hardcore it's illegal to
[02:17:18.920 --> 02:17:23.520]  have the CIA running all these threat fusion centers this is all illegal what
[02:17:23.520 --> 02:17:27.480]  is it you don't understand about that illegal illegal illegal illegal illegal
[02:17:27.480 --> 02:17:33.600]  illegal to have Marines in Alabama at checkpoints in California illegal to
[02:17:33.600 --> 02:17:36.680]  have them in Tennessee with the Army and Marines at Homeland Security but when
[02:17:36.680 --> 02:17:41.240]  the governor said don't do it they said go fly a kite this is a criminal
[02:17:41.240 --> 02:17:45.480]  takeover just like Hitler use the military to take over Germany don't say
[02:17:45.480 --> 02:17:49.000]  you weren't warned later and cops I'm telling you you better get up off your
[02:17:49.000 --> 02:17:52.720]  hind ends like the general public need you to this as well and research what
[02:17:52.720 --> 02:17:59.360]  we're saying and look into it but continuing the post series has enough
[02:17:59.360 --> 02:18:03.360]  tantalizing information to tell to sell a lot of papers but almost nothing that
[02:18:03.360 --> 02:18:07.560]  exposes the illicit side of US operations a large portion of which is
[02:18:07.560 --> 02:18:11.960]  involved in recruiting training and running covert agents only a small
[02:18:11.960 --> 02:18:15.960]  portion of which are spying on real enemies a lot of spying targets are
[02:18:15.960 --> 02:18:19.720]  allies of patriotic Americans well that's come out like myself the Army
[02:18:19.720 --> 02:18:23.520]  watches me that's been declassified who the government worries could someday
[02:18:23.520 --> 02:18:27.160]  provide a source of rebellion against the growing totalitarian state scowls
[02:18:27.160 --> 02:18:30.840]  and further charges that there is a dark side to each agency of federal law
[02:18:30.840 --> 02:18:35.040]  enforcement the dark side involves a lot of compartmentalization front
[02:18:35.040 --> 02:18:39.560]  activities hidden budgets and false stories in order to keep honest
[02:18:39.560 --> 02:18:42.600]  government employees and agents from knowing what's really going on behind
[02:18:42.600 --> 02:18:46.560]  their backs the feds told cops we're gonna blow up building seven get
[02:18:46.560 --> 02:18:50.920]  everybody back and they blew it up in front everybody and we have the news
[02:18:50.920 --> 02:18:55.160]  footage of them saying this do you understand none of us are safe if they'll
[02:18:55.160 --> 02:18:59.280]  go kill a million Iraqis if they'll do all these other evil things the people
[02:18:59.280 --> 02:19:03.280]  that run our government you think you're safe you think they won't do the same
[02:19:03.280 --> 02:19:08.240]  thing to you they hate you they hate Americans they hate the free market they
[02:19:08.240 --> 02:19:12.480]  hate your private property they all want to dominate you that's their spirit
[02:19:12.480 --> 02:19:19.560]  that's who they are what few do get a glimpse of in the government dark side
[02:19:19.560 --> 02:19:23.560]  are warned off with threats some subtle and some lethal threats which send a
[02:19:23.560 --> 02:19:27.000]  chilling message out to others not to ask you any questions scowls and then I'm
[02:19:27.000 --> 02:19:31.560]  getting on then quotes a post report saying that 9-11 the NSA has grown to
[02:19:31.560 --> 02:19:35.760]  where it constitutes 1.7 billion pieces of intercepted communications every 24
[02:19:35.760 --> 02:19:41.720]  hours emails that's nothing the phone companies are the NSA as I told you 12

[02:24:11.480 --> 02:24:16.280]  in Florida in the military Scott you've heard us breaking down how a criminal
[02:24:16.280 --> 02:24:19.760]  offshore takeover is almost complete everything we've broken down has now
[02:24:19.760 --> 02:24:24.280]  been admitted just secret police spies everywhere military being trained to take
[02:24:24.280 --> 02:24:30.480]  on the American people give us your take on it Roger I hate to go back on you
[02:24:30.480 --> 02:24:34.520]  but I have some intel on the pass along to you on this Middle Eastern strategy
[02:24:34.520 --> 02:24:42.080]  that the government is currently pursuing okay on 9-11 2001 I was stationed at
[02:24:42.080 --> 02:24:47.520]  Fort Stewart Georgia I was dating the administrative assistant of a high ranking
[02:24:47.520 --> 02:24:55.320]  officer there she informed me of a strategy within days of 9-11 and of
[02:24:55.320 --> 02:25:01.040]  course the comprehensive strategy were taken months if not years to create she
[02:25:01.040 --> 02:25:04.880]  informed me that Afghanistan would be invaded which I already knew that was
[02:25:04.880 --> 02:25:11.920]  early apparent and then she said Iraq would be the next target followed by
[02:25:11.920 --> 02:25:17.560]  Iran and Syria Pakistan may have to be infiltrated because it may be
[02:25:17.560 --> 02:25:22.760]  stabilized and that's now happening yes exactly and then she also informed me
[02:25:22.760 --> 02:25:31.280]  that Lebanon and Jordan would fall and possibly Syria even after Iraq and
[02:25:31.280 --> 02:25:36.000]  Iran were out of the way I discounted this information because I thought she
[02:25:36.000 --> 02:25:40.240]  had lost her mind to be quite honest with you well you know you know Newsweek
[02:25:40.240 --> 02:25:45.080]  reported the week after 9-11 that Bush launched the attack orders to attack
[02:25:45.080 --> 02:25:50.640]  Afghanistan on September 10th exactly apparently this whole strategy was in
[02:25:50.640 --> 02:25:58.080]  place before 9-11 is the only conclusion I can come to and and and and that kind
[02:25:58.080 --> 02:26:04.560]  of shut up put a little doubt on who was responsible for 9-11 and at the same
[02:26:04.560 --> 02:26:09.400]  time every one of these dominoes that she told me about his or has taken place as
[02:26:09.400 --> 02:26:14.360]  far as every one of these instances of you know it's a 1984 Israeli plan and
[02:26:14.360 --> 02:26:19.200]  that's been declassified picked up in 99-2000 and developed and then the
[02:26:19.200 --> 02:26:22.640]  attacks for stage and the rest is history exactly and they're following it
[02:26:22.640 --> 02:26:28.120]  to a tee and what really caught me by surprise was that she told me about this
[02:26:28.120 --> 02:26:32.760]  so soon after 9-11 because there's no way they could have had this plan unless
[02:26:32.760 --> 02:26:37.000]  the plan was already in place before 9-11 there's no way they could have
[02:26:37.000 --> 02:26:42.480]  come with this after 9-11 so all this has been in place probably for more than a
[02:26:42.480 --> 02:26:47.920]  decade as you're saying Alex and now it's coming to fruition and so I would say
[02:26:47.920 --> 02:26:52.120]  within a few months we can look forward to an invasion of Iran
[02:26:52.120 --> 02:26:58.120]  pretty much positively we'll be invading Iran so far I think she told me as
[02:26:58.120 --> 02:27:03.960]  come to fruition and I really didn't uh... didn't put much stock in at the
[02:27:03.960 --> 02:27:09.600]  time even though she did have access to high-level brass and apparently over
[02:27:09.600 --> 02:27:13.840]  her to the high-level meeting I thought she must must have misunderstood what
[02:27:13.840 --> 02:27:17.160]  had been said or something well it turns out that's open intelligence that you
[02:27:17.160 --> 02:27:21.120]  just relayed here on air God bless you Scott I appreciate your call call back
[02:27:21.120 --> 02:27:24.840]  again Chris and Marilyn military you're on the air
[02:27:24.840 --> 02:27:27.400]  hey Alex good to hear you again good to hear you
[02:27:27.400 --> 02:27:30.600]  first off before I start I just want to let you know I sent your people a
[02:27:30.600 --> 02:27:35.400]  Huffington Post report today where it states that 481,000
[02:27:35.400 --> 02:27:39.560]  workers from different cities and counties throughout the country
[02:27:39.560 --> 02:27:42.600]  it comes up to be about roughly sixty
[02:27:42.600 --> 02:27:45.880]  three percent of our cities and thirty nine percent of our counties are cutting
[02:27:45.880 --> 02:27:48.920]  public safety personnel like firemen and policemen
[02:27:48.920 --> 02:27:53.320]  just let them take a look and they're increasing funding for SWAT
[02:27:53.320 --> 02:27:57.800]  special weapons attack teams the public name is special weapons and tactics
[02:27:57.800 --> 02:28:02.040]  right now also from my military perspective I was in during the first
[02:28:02.040 --> 02:28:05.640]  Gulf War and one thing that we we learned was
[02:28:05.640 --> 02:28:09.160]  that we trained before during the Cold War for
[02:28:09.160 --> 02:28:13.880]  high-intensity conflicts then all of a sudden after the Gulf War
[02:28:13.880 --> 02:28:16.760]  we turn around and turn into peacekeepers
[02:28:16.760 --> 02:28:20.040]  and we get trained to go into other countries
[02:28:20.040 --> 02:28:23.160]  and do policing action so it actually started
[02:28:23.160 --> 02:28:29.000]  from my experience back in the first bush administration
[02:28:29.000 --> 02:28:33.000]  what's your view on the fact that it's confirmed they are training
[02:28:33.000 --> 02:28:37.960]  the military to take on the american people and confiscate guns
[02:28:37.960 --> 02:28:42.600]  I wouldn't say it's too far off I would not say that it's I think it's right up
[02:28:42.600 --> 02:28:46.120]  could be as far as tomorrow and you know those stage terror attacks on the
[02:28:46.120 --> 02:28:49.640]  troops and say patriots did it you can see that script
[02:28:49.640 --> 02:28:53.560]  now being rolled out did you think the military is going to buy it
[02:28:53.560 --> 02:28:57.480]  I told my dad I hope not I said I'd hope that our military would be smart enough
[02:28:57.480 --> 02:29:01.400]  that if it got too crazy that our military would not turn on our own
[02:29:01.400 --> 02:29:04.920]  families and they would use a weaponry to fight the system
[02:29:04.920 --> 02:29:08.840]  because we got tanks we got the anti-tank killing machines and stuff like
[02:29:08.840 --> 02:29:11.640]  that that they would probably say at one point I'm
[02:29:11.640 --> 02:29:15.320]  hoping I just hope that our men and women in service will say
[02:29:15.320 --> 02:29:19.640]  hey this is nuts and take those weapons that they were trained to use and fight
[02:29:19.640 --> 02:29:23.480]  the establishment for the people and defend the constitution like
[02:29:23.480 --> 02:29:26.760]  I raised my hand against enemies foreign and domestic
[02:29:26.760 --> 02:29:31.240]  well I'll tell you this I hope that we can fix things peacefully
[02:29:31.240 --> 02:29:35.240]  but the system wants a physical fight God bless you Chris

[02:34:27.800 --> 02:34:31.560]  i'm doing all right yeah i was just wanted to call in because what your
[02:34:31.560 --> 02:34:35.240]  guest was talking about earlier about this iranian war turning into an all
[02:34:35.240 --> 02:34:39.080]  out nuclear war well i was in the air force in 07
[02:34:39.080 --> 02:34:43.000]  and we had an exercise called the 8063 where they were
[02:34:43.000 --> 02:34:47.080]  preparing us for a worldwide nuclear devastation
[02:34:47.080 --> 02:34:51.000]  where i worked on an aerial refueler and they'd have us
[02:34:51.000 --> 02:34:54.840]  get them uh what they called locked and cocked to where the aircraft was good
[02:34:54.840 --> 02:34:59.720]  with maintenance all over and then it was sealed up and guarded by our sp
[02:34:59.720 --> 02:35:03.720]  now about two weeks after one of our exercises and i don't know if you could
[02:35:03.720 --> 02:35:07.960]  help me out with this they uh they had something similar to where they had to
[02:35:07.960 --> 02:35:12.360]  go out and lock everything down they didn't have the sp guarding it
[02:35:12.360 --> 02:35:15.320]  and then all of a sudden they got the call and all the pilots came out and
[02:35:15.320 --> 02:35:19.560]  had those uh refuelers up in the air within like 15 minutes
[02:35:19.560 --> 02:35:23.560]  and they were all uh loaded with 350 000 pounds of fuel
[02:35:23.560 --> 02:35:27.240]  now when we uh talked to the pilots when they came back down they said
[02:35:27.240 --> 02:35:31.320]  that they uh was refueling a flight of b1 bombers
[02:35:31.320 --> 02:35:35.320]  and that they headed out west from california and then who knows where
[02:35:35.320 --> 02:35:40.760]  well you know they launched the attack in on 888 in 2008 against russia trying to
[02:35:40.760 --> 02:35:45.000]  start a nuclear war the russians moved in mobile medium range
[02:35:45.000 --> 02:35:49.480]  and icbm long range launchers and the head of the russian military said we're
[02:35:49.480 --> 02:35:53.000]  preparing for nuclear war and so the nato troops that were landing in
[02:35:53.000 --> 02:35:56.920]  airfields then pulled out so these are psychopaths that run our government
[02:35:56.920 --> 02:36:00.360]  they are the bad guys and the russians are the bad guys the iranians are the bad
[02:36:00.360 --> 02:36:03.240]  guys government's bad what did jesus say wickedness in
[02:36:03.240 --> 02:36:06.440]  high places but the point is the big mega empire
[02:36:06.440 --> 02:36:10.600]  is this big corporate structure and they need to get their world government
[02:36:10.600 --> 02:36:13.160]  established and nuclear war is the way to get it
[02:36:13.160 --> 02:36:16.600]  we should all be praying right now and and calling congress and everybody in
[02:36:16.600 --> 02:36:21.320]  saying don't take us to war with iran i appreciate your call greg
[02:36:21.320 --> 02:36:25.240]  chris in arizona with the marines go ahead chris

[02:36:28.680 --> 02:36:32.280]  and i love you you know you're doing a great job
[02:36:32.280 --> 02:36:38.920]  uh i have a few quick points i guess uh i was the one who called in a couple
[02:36:38.920 --> 02:36:42.040]  months ago you know i was coming into work and uh
[02:36:42.040 --> 02:36:45.560]  some federal agent was behind me looked at the bumper sticker on my
[02:36:45.560 --> 02:36:49.720]  truck and you know he called my work my workshop and
[02:36:49.720 --> 02:36:53.400]  you know i got talking to you about that but i got nothing ever happened to me
[02:36:53.400 --> 02:36:57.240]  there's no follow-up i don't know you got these millions of secret police spies
[02:36:57.240 --> 02:37:01.000]  not just the government ones and they're all trained to look for american flags
[02:37:01.000 --> 02:37:05.560]  gas and flags and spy on people and they just can't wait to start actually
[02:37:05.560 --> 02:37:08.440]  going after us they just they just hate us
[02:37:08.440 --> 02:37:12.440]  yeah i i looked at the myac report it's all in there
[02:37:12.440 --> 02:37:17.880]  uh we i work for contract security on a military base here in arizona
[02:37:17.880 --> 02:37:22.840]  and um a lot just told me about uh our uh on the guard and we have uh police
[02:37:22.840 --> 02:37:26.440]  counterparts that we work with and she was telling me about there's
[02:37:26.440 --> 02:37:29.480]  just one uh every time he'd pull somebody over
[02:37:29.480 --> 02:37:33.160]  he'd be barking at him you know like a a drill instructor
[02:37:33.160 --> 02:37:36.520]  and they finally got you know a few people got fed up and they
[02:37:36.520 --> 02:37:40.920]  they they uh basically went to his carriers and
[02:37:40.920 --> 02:37:45.320]  he got reprimanded so hopefully well this is part of our training that you
[02:37:45.320 --> 02:37:49.560]  they put all these control freak uh green horns in power
[02:37:49.560 --> 02:37:53.000]  to let the american people get used to being lined up to being searched to
[02:37:53.000 --> 02:37:57.000]  being controlled to being bossed around to being face scanned thumb printed
[02:37:57.000 --> 02:38:00.600]  but then the illegal aliens they're they're untouchable
[02:38:00.600 --> 02:38:06.440]  95 of la county uh murder warrants that they can't seem to deliver
[02:38:06.440 --> 02:38:10.920]  are for illegal aliens so it just shows how lawless this government is
[02:38:10.920 --> 02:38:16.200]  yes exactly i guess uh people would wake up if they started illegally pulling
[02:38:16.200 --> 02:38:21.560]  over ipads question ipads hey chris i appreciate your call

[02:39:33.640 --> 02:39:37.480]  constitution but no the federal judge says no
[02:39:37.480 --> 02:39:41.880]  right the judge just blocked it today
[02:39:41.880 --> 02:39:45.960]  well you've heard me ranting and raving about how they're training our police
[02:39:45.960 --> 02:39:49.000]  in iraq to shut down cities and confiscate guns
[02:39:49.000 --> 02:39:51.800]  and then i pulled up what the caller said and confirmed it was in the mainstream
[02:39:51.800 --> 02:39:54.840]  news what's your take on that
[02:39:54.840 --> 02:39:58.840]  oh man i just don't know what to think anymore uh you know alex we have stuff
[02:39:58.840 --> 02:40:02.040]  coming out from every angle we don't and and i think it's it's all
[02:40:02.040 --> 02:40:05.640]  it's all on purpose to confuse everybody and nobody's gonna know who to
[02:40:05.640 --> 02:40:08.520]  trust each other and and you know myself and and
[02:40:08.520 --> 02:40:11.720]  everybody around me we just we talk about it on the down low and
[02:40:11.720 --> 02:40:14.200]  we just don't know what to think alex that's why we look to you for some
[02:40:14.200 --> 02:40:17.720]  leadership and we got to make sure who we can trust and that's why we're glad
[02:40:17.720 --> 02:40:21.080]  that you come out and you talk about you know why we can trust you and
[02:40:21.080 --> 02:40:24.440]  how you're not you know part of the establishment and we just want you to
[02:40:24.440 --> 02:40:27.240]  keep doing more of that and have more patriots calling in
[02:40:27.240 --> 02:40:30.680]  well eric let me say this there's nothing wrong with you teaching the
[02:40:30.680 --> 02:40:33.800]  bill of rights and constitution to your cohorts
[02:40:33.800 --> 02:40:37.560]  and though they try to demonize it it's what this country's founded on and it's
[02:40:37.560 --> 02:40:40.200]  not bad and it's not a conspiracy theory to
[02:40:40.200 --> 02:40:44.040]  stand up for liberty and freedom and so just just have discussions about
[02:40:44.040 --> 02:40:47.080]  what's happening i mean when you talk to other members of the military are they
[02:40:47.080 --> 02:40:53.080]  starting to wake up um yeah you know they you know i'm a bit of a
[02:40:53.080 --> 02:40:57.160]  you know a tinfoil hat myself and and and i you know all these nine eleven
[02:40:57.160 --> 02:41:00.840]  videos i feel like a bunch of them are disinformation
[02:41:00.840 --> 02:41:04.600]  and you know a lot of them don't show the actual crashes and and
[02:41:04.600 --> 02:41:07.480]  actually i've been wanting to ask you for a long time and now i have the
[02:41:07.480 --> 02:41:10.760]  opportunity i was i was wanting to know what your opinion was about the media
[02:41:10.760 --> 02:41:15.000]  fakery angle on it and the simon shack video series because that to me is the
[02:41:15.000 --> 02:41:19.320]  most interesting because i know that every time we hear people in the media
[02:41:19.320 --> 02:41:23.480]  bring up nine eleven they're the ones that scream the loudest and to me
[02:41:23.480 --> 02:41:28.120]  they have the most to lose well eric eric i appreciate your call but
[02:41:28.120 --> 02:41:32.120]  i have friends people i've known for many years who were there
[02:41:32.120 --> 02:41:37.080]  and saw the second aircraft and you talk about disinformation i think that's
[02:41:37.080 --> 02:41:41.320]  been put out and promoted by the media as a way to you know we're saying we
[02:41:41.320 --> 02:41:44.360]  don't know what happened with nine eleven but we know the official story
[02:41:44.360 --> 02:41:47.480]  has been proven to be a lie i mean they blew up building seven in front of us
[02:41:47.480 --> 02:41:50.520]  and said they were going to blow it up all over the news
[02:41:50.520 --> 02:41:53.880]  and we have police saying get back they're blowing it up
[02:41:53.880 --> 02:41:57.320]  and then we interviewed the deputy head of emergency management for new york
[02:41:57.320 --> 02:42:01.000]  and he was dead a few weeks later and he said yeah no there was explosions going
[02:42:01.000 --> 02:42:05.640]  off before the towers even fell down they were going to blow up seven
[02:42:05.640 --> 02:42:10.120]  i mean all of that is on record and so i just stick to what i can prove
[02:42:10.120 --> 02:42:14.280]  and i appreciate your call though now look we've got open phones right now
[02:42:14.280 --> 02:42:18.120]  we've got open lines right now wide open for police
[02:42:18.120 --> 02:42:21.480]  and military and others and i'm asking police and military
[02:42:21.480 --> 02:42:24.440]  are you part of this urban warfare training that's admitted
[02:42:24.440 --> 02:42:27.560]  what do you think of the gun confiscation in new orleans
[02:42:27.560 --> 02:42:31.080]  when the global estate terror attacks or let real terrorists come in and attack
[02:42:31.080 --> 02:42:35.240]  us if we go after iran do you understand your training
[02:42:35.240 --> 02:42:38.760]  and the entire architecture of this is pointed at the american people
[02:42:38.760 --> 02:42:44.840]  i want to hear your views on the dark side of the police and military and and
[02:42:44.840 --> 02:42:47.960]  now how that's becoming revealed because they're getting ready to try to roll it
[02:42:47.960 --> 02:42:51.240]  out against us it's admitted they've had sound
[02:42:51.240 --> 02:42:55.240]  cannons at tea party events in san diego it's admitted the army spies on in the
[02:42:55.240 --> 02:42:58.600]  fed protest i mean all of this is treason
[02:42:58.600 --> 02:43:05.320]  1-800-259-9231 or our police and military so scared a big
[02:43:05.320 --> 02:43:08.120]  brother that they're even afraid to exercise their free speech
[02:43:08.120 --> 02:43:10.680]  we haven't had any police we had quite a few yesterday
[02:43:10.680 --> 02:43:14.280]  call in on this subject we've got 17 minutes left
[02:43:14.280 --> 02:43:23.240]  i want to hear from you 1-800-259-9231 or the wives of military
[02:43:23.240 --> 02:43:26.680]  or police that want to call in and talk about what their husbands
[02:43:26.680 --> 02:43:30.280]  or their wives if your wives are the military police that have been going
[02:43:30.280 --> 02:43:32.920]  through this training it's all out in the open
[02:43:32.920 --> 02:43:37.400]  millions of private spies not 854 000 like the washington post says
[02:43:37.400 --> 02:43:41.720]  3 million police 400 000 battle hardened army they want to use
[02:43:41.720 --> 02:43:45.320]  domestically and all the training is pointed at the people
[02:43:45.320 --> 02:43:48.760]  and the government will pass laws to take your property take your ranch
[02:43:48.760 --> 02:43:52.040]  take your farm if you resist you're going to be called a terrorist they're
[02:43:52.040 --> 02:43:55.320]  going to kill you we need to have an open discussion
[02:43:55.320 --> 02:43:59.880]  about this now and say no to it
[02:43:59.880 --> 02:44:04.360]  there's another just incredible story
[02:44:04.360 --> 02:44:08.680]  today by dr paul craig roberts the father of reginomics former head of the
[02:44:08.680 --> 02:44:12.440]  treasury under reagan up on info wars dot com
[02:44:12.440 --> 02:44:17.080]  and prison planet dot com and it's the year america
[02:44:17.080 --> 02:44:24.600]  dissolved it was 2017 clans were governing america
[02:44:24.600 --> 02:44:27.640]  the first clans organized around local police forces
[02:44:27.640 --> 02:44:31.000]  the conservatives war on crime during the late 20th century
[02:44:31.000 --> 02:44:34.840]  and the bush obama war on terror during the first decade of the 21st century
[02:44:34.840 --> 02:44:39.240]  had resulted in the police becoming militarized and unaccountable
[02:44:39.240 --> 02:44:43.000]  as society broke down the police became warlords the state
[02:44:43.000 --> 02:44:47.720]  police broke apart and the officers were
[02:44:47.720 --> 02:44:51.320]  subsumed into the local forces of their communities
[02:44:51.320 --> 02:44:55.640]  the newly formed tribes expanded to encompass
[02:44:55.640 --> 02:44:59.080]  the relatives and friends of the police that's already what happens in a
[02:44:59.080 --> 02:45:02.040]  tyranny anybody who's part of the thug system has all these special
[02:45:02.040 --> 02:45:06.760]  rights it's a new class the dollar had collapsed as the
[02:45:06.760 --> 02:45:10.120]  world reserve currency in 2012 when the worsening economic depression
[02:45:10.120 --> 02:45:13.720]  made it clear to washington's creditors that the federal
[02:45:13.720 --> 02:45:17.800]  budget deficit was too large to be financed except by printing of money
[02:45:17.800 --> 02:45:21.400]  with the dollar's demise import prices skyrocketed americans were unable to
[02:45:21.400 --> 02:45:25.480]  afford foreign made goods the transnational corporations that
[02:45:25.480 --> 02:45:28.600]  were producing offshore for us markets were bankrupted
[02:45:28.600 --> 02:45:32.440]  further eroding the government's revenue base the government was forced to print
[02:45:32.440 --> 02:45:36.760]  money in order to pay its bills causing domestic prices to rise rapidly
[02:45:36.760 --> 02:45:39.480]  faced with hyperinflation washington took recourse
[02:45:39.480 --> 02:45:43.400]  intermitting social security and medicare and followed by the confiscating
[02:45:43.400 --> 02:45:48.840]  the remnants of private pensions this provided a one-year respite but with no
[02:45:48.840 --> 02:45:53.080]  more resources to confiscate money creation and hyperinflation resumed
[02:45:53.080 --> 02:45:56.600]  organized food deliveries broke down that's already starting to happen and
[02:45:56.600 --> 02:45:59.880]  police forces are disbanding with the government found hyperinflation with
[02:45:59.880 --> 02:46:02.760]  fixed prices and the mandate all purchases and
[02:46:02.760 --> 02:46:07.880]  sales had to be with us paper currency unwilling to trade appreciating goods
[02:46:07.880 --> 02:46:11.880]  for depreciating dollars goods disappeared from stores
[02:46:11.880 --> 02:46:15.000]  washington responded as lennon had done during the
[02:46:15.000 --> 02:46:18.680]  war of communism period of soviet history the government sent troops to
[02:46:18.680 --> 02:46:22.280]  confiscate goods for distribution in kind of the population
[02:46:22.280 --> 02:46:26.360]  that's what's starting to happen in venezuela this was a temporary stop gap
[02:46:26.360 --> 02:46:31.880]  until existing stocks were depleted as future production was discouraged
[02:46:31.880 --> 02:46:35.160]  much of the confiscated stocks became the property
[02:46:35.160 --> 02:46:39.560]  of troops who seized the goods and then it just goes into the nightmare
[02:46:39.560 --> 02:46:42.840]  collapse scenario in fact the whole article didn't print you guys print it
[02:46:42.840 --> 02:46:49.160]  again for me thanks okay that is the year america dissolved 2017
[02:46:49.160 --> 02:46:52.360]  and this is what the globalists actually want they're going to reorganize it
[02:46:52.360 --> 02:46:54.920]  before it ever gets to that point but it's going to get close to this
[02:46:54.920 --> 02:46:58.920]  that's their stated plan let's go to roi in georgia

[02:56:24.760 --> 02:56:28.120]  uh... uh... former a police officer i know that's what the
[02:56:28.120 --> 02:56:32.120]  state high patrol you know the state of ohio
[02:56:32.120 --> 02:56:38.680]  allowed fifty state patrolmen to go to the g-27 in pennsylvania
[02:56:38.680 --> 02:56:42.120]  i know it's incredible mark you got to come back again key info
[02:56:42.120 --> 02:56:46.200]  jc and wyoming last caller marines go ahead
[02:56:46.200 --> 02:56:49.160]  hey alec how you doing good buddy got a minute and a half
[02:56:49.160 --> 02:56:53.160]  okay uh... first of all former marine and uh... do you remember the whole
[02:56:53.160 --> 02:56:56.040]  jordan standoff with the free men up in montana
[02:56:56.040 --> 02:57:00.120]  yes okay well i was in the marines at the time
[02:57:00.120 --> 02:57:03.640]  and they thought it was gonna kind of go ugly i think because they came to my
[02:57:03.640 --> 02:57:06.600]  marine unit because we were very close by
[02:57:06.600 --> 02:57:11.560]  and asked if we could assist them if things went south
[02:57:11.560 --> 02:57:16.360]  and uh... a lot of us had a lot of us in my unit had some problems with it
[02:57:16.360 --> 02:57:20.280]  so that's done everywhere just to acclimate everyone
[02:57:20.280 --> 02:57:23.480]  well but some of us especially the way we're raised in montana
[02:57:23.480 --> 02:57:25.960]  a lot of us are like well we got a problem with it
[02:57:25.960 --> 02:57:29.160]  but at work what they tried to hit us with and i think a lot of these young
[02:57:29.160 --> 02:57:31.560]  guys are getting hit with alex is
[02:57:31.560 --> 02:57:36.040]  part of your old old keepers keep talking about part of your old is
[02:57:36.040 --> 02:57:40.440]  um... to defend the constitution or defend the country
[02:57:40.440 --> 02:57:44.760]  against enemies both born and the mess but the congress has got to do that
[02:57:44.760 --> 02:57:49.000]  and we have posse commentators because it's a danger to the nation you just
[02:57:49.000 --> 02:57:52.040]  can't have police show up and say come help us
[02:57:52.040 --> 02:57:55.720]  exactly this is what i'm trying to say they're using that play on words
[02:57:55.720 --> 02:57:59.800]  calling uh... patriots domestic terrorist yes because
[02:57:59.800 --> 02:58:03.000]  that that that gets these younger kids thinking
[02:58:03.000 --> 02:58:07.560]  domestic terrorist and then there's more old to defend the country against
[02:58:07.560 --> 02:58:11.800]  them uh... enemies born in domestic so that's why the
[02:58:11.800 --> 02:58:15.960]  the key play on words domestic terror i mean
[02:58:15.960 --> 02:58:20.040]  i think they've i think instead of teaching the constitution like they
[02:58:20.040 --> 02:58:24.840]  should be in the bill of rights they're they're more using key points and play
[02:58:24.840 --> 02:58:28.440]  on words i agree i'm out of time call me back again
[02:58:28.440 --> 02:58:31.480]  uh... but i would just add to this the real
[02:58:31.480 --> 02:58:35.080]  domestic enemies of these foreign corporations setting up a world government
[02:58:35.080 --> 02:58:39.160]  and looting us through the treasury webster tarp is coming up with key news
