[00:00.000 --> 00:06.760]  This is Rob Dew from infowars.com with a special Bilderberg 2015 report.
[00:06.760 --> 00:10.640]  Now next week, myself, Josh Owens, will be traveling to Austria.
[00:10.640 --> 00:12.840]  We will be meeting Paul Joseph Watson there.
[00:12.840 --> 00:17.520]  And we will be in the Tyrol region, which is a state of Austria, sort of in the eastern
[00:17.520 --> 00:18.520]  mountain region.
[00:18.520 --> 00:23.400]  A lot of ski resorts there, a lot of tourism, but a lot of small towns.
[00:23.400 --> 00:28.360]  And the hotel, the Interhappen Hotel, where the 2015 Bilderberg will be taking place is
[00:28.360 --> 00:29.360]  very secluded.
[00:29.360 --> 00:35.240]  We're going to put a map version up and you can see it's surrounded by trees and forests.
[00:35.240 --> 00:39.840]  There's a golf course nearby, but then nothing else for about 15 minutes.
[00:39.840 --> 00:44.440]  So it is definitely isolated and there's a lot of security going on ramping up for this
[00:44.440 --> 00:47.840]  and there's a lot being written about that, but not in the American press.
[00:47.840 --> 00:49.120]  It's mostly in the foreign press.
[00:49.120 --> 00:54.400]  I actually had to find these articles there from Austrian websites and German websites,
[00:54.400 --> 00:59.320]  and an RT international website, and I had to translate them using Google Chrome.
[00:59.320 --> 01:04.800]  So some of these quotes that I'll be reading from might not be in the most perfect English,
[01:04.800 --> 01:06.680]  but we'll just go ahead and run through those.
[01:06.680 --> 01:10.280]  But before I get to those articles, I just want to let you know we will be providing
[01:10.280 --> 01:14.160]  total coverage while we were at Bilderberg 2015.
[01:14.160 --> 01:17.400]  Both Josh and myself are pretty good editors and cameraman.
[01:17.400 --> 01:20.520]  Plus we'll have Paul Joseph Watson there providing some of the best intel and using
[01:20.520 --> 01:22.020]  his contacts.
[01:22.020 --> 01:25.960]  So I think we're going to be giving you a really complete picture of what's going on.
[01:25.960 --> 01:31.160]  There's going to be several protests in the towns surrounding the Interhaupen Hotel,
[01:31.160 --> 01:32.960]  and we're going to be covering those as well.
[01:32.960 --> 01:38.240]  So be checking the Alex Jones channel on YouTube, be checking our Ustream channel,
[01:38.240 --> 01:42.280]  and we'll be putting all the links of that in this video so you can check that book market
[01:42.280 --> 01:44.760]  and go back to it as Bilderberg takes place.
[01:44.760 --> 01:49.200]  We'll be landing on Monday on the 7th of June.
[01:49.200 --> 01:53.440]  And what makes this Bilderberg so different from all the others is now we have this war
[01:53.440 --> 01:54.880]  in the Ukraine.
[01:54.880 --> 01:58.880]  So that is going to be on the main agenda of what is talked about there in Bilderberg.
[01:58.880 --> 02:01.120]  Of course, it'll all be in secret.
[02:01.120 --> 02:02.680]  Also about the killing of cash.
[02:02.680 --> 02:03.920]  That is now the new buzzword.
[02:03.920 --> 02:08.400]  We have to get rid of cash so we can let bankers basically not even print money anymore.
[02:08.400 --> 02:13.520]  They're just going to change digits in spreadsheets and thereby giving themselves millions and
[02:13.520 --> 02:15.080]  taking it away from us.
[02:15.080 --> 02:19.120]  And also the amount of foreign immigrants they're going to be bringing into Europe.
[02:19.120 --> 02:20.400]  That will be discussed.
[02:20.400 --> 02:24.160]  They're definitely doing it here on our southern border and it's not just Mexican immigrants.
[02:24.160 --> 02:29.560]  It's also Central American, South American, and even African immigrants as we've shown
[02:29.560 --> 02:32.360]  the videos here and showed you the news reports.
[02:32.360 --> 02:35.680]  So there's a lot to be talked about at this year's Bilderberg.
[02:35.680 --> 02:37.520]  So this is going to be a very important one.
[02:37.520 --> 02:40.080]  Also it is right near the G7.
[02:40.080 --> 02:44.200]  In fact, the G7 is going to be just a few days before Bilderberg and it's only going
[02:44.200 --> 02:51.260]  to be about 40 miles away in Elmew, which is I believe in Germany, the Bavarian area.
[02:51.260 --> 02:57.560]  And so they will be traveling from there to the Hotel Interhalpen for Bilderberg 2015.
[02:57.560 --> 03:02.400]  ExtremeNews.com reports that the Interhalpen Hotel is just a 26 kilometer or a 40 minute
[03:02.400 --> 03:06.960]  drive from the Elmew region where they will be meeting for the G7.
[03:06.960 --> 03:11.560]  ExtremeNews also reports that up to 2,000 Austrian police will be in the area surrounding
[03:11.560 --> 03:16.760]  the hotel, also up to 24 specialists from the anti-terrorism elite unit, which they
[03:16.760 --> 03:21.960]  call Cobra, which I think is really interesting, Cobra being the mortal enemy of the fictional
[03:21.960 --> 03:22.960]  G.I.
[03:22.960 --> 03:23.960]  Joe.
[03:23.960 --> 03:28.640]  And in addition, there's going to be up to 17,000 German police officers on the border
[03:28.640 --> 03:34.000]  ready to come in if called for and they're estimating up to 360 million being spent
[03:34.000 --> 03:38.200]  on all the security, of course, which the taxpayers are going to be paying for.
[03:38.200 --> 03:43.160]  Tycho Strong reported in his newsletter that the abolition of cash in addition to the issues
[03:43.160 --> 03:47.400]  in the Ukraine conflict and the promotion of refugee flows to Europe will be on this
[03:47.400 --> 03:49.680]  year's Bilderberg agenda.
[03:49.680 --> 03:52.360]  And I'm sure there will be other issues of importance that will be talked about in this
[03:52.360 --> 03:53.360]  year's meeting.
[03:53.360 --> 03:57.440]  And we will be getting those through the leaks, through the normal channels of people hearing
[03:57.440 --> 04:00.120]  what's going on there and coming out and saying, hey, this is bad.
[04:00.120 --> 04:03.080]  We've got these world leaders planning some really terrifying things.
[04:03.080 --> 04:05.080]  So we're going to be getting a lot of tips that way.
[04:05.080 --> 04:06.520]  You can rest assured.
[04:06.520 --> 04:11.120]  I found an interesting tidbit on a website called Ausberger Augmine.
[04:11.120 --> 04:15.920]  And they're reporting that the footpaths and different hiking trails around the Hotel
[04:15.920 --> 04:18.960]  Interalpen are already being controlled.
[04:18.960 --> 04:24.320]  And they say, this is interesting, hikers are advised to insert a card in the pack,
[04:24.320 --> 04:26.280]  which I think means have your ID on you.
[04:26.280 --> 04:30.320]  But that's how Google translator translated this particular article.
[04:30.320 --> 04:32.680]  But we're going to put the links to all these articles down there.
[04:32.680 --> 04:36.400]  And I encourage you to get them, translate them for yourself or if you do speak German,
[04:36.400 --> 04:39.840]  maybe put what they're really saying in these in the comments below.
[04:39.840 --> 04:43.240]  The DIR standard contains a report from publisher Oscar Bronner.
[04:43.240 --> 04:47.600]  And what she talks about, alternative conferences that will be taking place, one in Innsbruck
[04:47.600 --> 04:48.920]  and one in Telves.
[04:48.920 --> 04:52.320]  The Innsbruck one will be more like a conference where people are going to get together to
[04:52.320 --> 04:55.960]  talk about Bilderberg and Telves, there will actually be a demonstration.
[04:55.960 --> 04:56.960]  Telves.
[04:56.960 --> 04:57.960]  All right.
[04:57.960 --> 04:58.960]  See the full report info wars.com.
[04:58.960 --> 04:59.960]  We're live on Thursday.
[04:59.960 --> 05:00.960]  Stay with us.
[05:00.960 --> 05:05.560]  Despite this administration's dedication to transparency, FOIA backlogs have soared since
[05:05.560 --> 05:08.680]  President Barack Obama took office in 2009.
[05:08.680 --> 05:13.960]  A spike in requests is to be expected in an administration plagued with scandal.
[05:13.960 --> 05:17.560]  After it was revealed that they'd singled out conservative groups applying for tax
[05:17.560 --> 05:23.480]  exempt status, the IRS cost the taxpayers $20 million so they could hand over more than
[05:23.480 --> 05:26.240]  a million pages of documents to investigators.
[05:26.240 --> 05:29.040]  And that doesn't even include lowest learners emails.
[05:29.040 --> 05:33.800]  Speaking of missing emails, the House GOP has threatened to block some State Department
[05:33.800 --> 05:38.120]  funding until officials speed up their response to FOIA requests.
[05:38.120 --> 05:42.200]  The State Department responded saying the funding cut would only further cripple its
[05:42.200 --> 05:43.200]  efforts.
[05:43.200 --> 05:47.520]  After all, it's not just the Benghazi scandal and Hillary's email practices.
[05:47.520 --> 05:52.120]  The state's also dealing with massive FOIA requests for how contributions to the Clinton
[05:52.120 --> 05:56.840]  Foundation may or may not have influenced Clinton on the job.
[05:56.840 --> 06:00.280]  Leigh Ann McAdder reporting for info wars.com.
[06:00.280 --> 06:06.440]  For all of recorded history, civilizations around the world praised the health benefits
[06:06.440 --> 06:07.440]  of silver.

[07:00.200 --> 07:01.360]  Another major health threat.
[07:01.360 --> 07:05.640]  This one in Toledo, Ohio, where everybody in the entire city has been told not to drink
[07:05.640 --> 07:06.640]  the water.
[07:06.640 --> 07:08.960]  Ohio's governor declaring a state of emergency.
[07:08.960 --> 07:14.680]  Did you know that the average person uses about 80 to 100 gallons of water at home every
[07:14.680 --> 07:15.960]  single day?
[07:15.960 --> 07:18.960]  If there's a water emergency, will you be prepared?
[07:18.960 --> 07:21.840]  Panicked residents forming long lines throughout the day.
[07:21.840 --> 07:23.920]  We're here at a supermarket in Toledo.
[07:23.920 --> 07:26.840]  You can see the shelves empty where water once was.
[07:26.840 --> 07:32.760]  To stay safe and healthy during a crisis, you must have access to safe, clean water.
[07:32.760 --> 07:35.880]  Water which will not be available at your local grocery store.
[07:35.880 --> 07:39.160]  There's a mad dash on right now to stock up on supplies.
[07:39.160 --> 07:45.160]  The ProPure Pro 1 G2.0 water filtration system is a must-have for every modern, independently
[07:45.160 --> 07:46.920]  minded household.
[07:46.920 --> 07:49.720]  It's your family's safety during an emergency.

[07:56.000 --> 08:21.000]  or call 1-88-253-3139.
[08:26.000 --> 08:44.860]  Yesterday, I talked about the fact that people like Vince Vaughn coming out for the Second
[08:44.860 --> 08:53.040]  Amendment and against the worship of the state was another major crack in the facade
[08:53.040 --> 08:58.720]  or another hole letting light in in the electronic Berlin Wall.
[08:58.720 --> 09:06.240]  The dinosaur, so-called mainstream media, has been projecting the facade that everybody's
[09:06.240 --> 09:12.360]  happy and everything's wonderful like the Lego movie theme song.
[09:12.360 --> 09:17.680]  And that everybody basically is on the mainstream Republican or mainstream Democrat reservation
[09:17.680 --> 09:24.400]  when every poll, every sociological indicator shows not just here in the United States or
[09:24.400 --> 09:30.280]  Canada or Mexico for that matter, not just in North America, but all over the world.
[09:30.280 --> 09:35.520]  There is unprecedented awakenings happening right now and the establishment is trying
[09:35.520 --> 09:41.040]  to co-op those but unsuccessfully in many cases.
[09:41.040 --> 09:44.640]  That's why it's more important than ever for those of us that want to promote cultures
[09:44.640 --> 09:50.700]  of renaissance, cultures of the Enlightenment, cultures of true liberalism in the Thomas
[09:50.700 --> 09:58.080]  Jeffersonian vein need to be more aggressive and louder than ever.
[09:58.080 --> 10:06.920]  Publishing and speaking and suing and producing culture, resisting, demonstrating, voting
[10:06.920 --> 10:11.880]  with our dollars, taking people out shooting for the first time.
[10:11.880 --> 10:19.080]  I'm going to take someone who's never been out shooting ever with shotguns, skeet shooting.
[10:19.080 --> 10:23.160]  They'll be converted within minutes.
[10:23.160 --> 10:30.360]  They have trepidation now, they'll have that gleam in their eye within five minutes finding
[10:30.360 --> 10:33.520]  out that there was nothing magic about it, that it was no big deal, that they could be
[10:33.520 --> 10:34.520]  empowered.
[10:34.520 --> 10:37.440]  It's that simple.
[10:37.440 --> 10:41.860]  That's why they want control of our kids in the schools to convert them to all the globalist
[10:41.860 --> 10:54.200]  ideologies before we can convert adults into loving freedom.
[10:54.200 --> 11:07.400]  There is as usual an over the top amount of key news today on the TPP, on WikiLeaks, on
[11:07.400 --> 11:16.000]  Bilderberg with their agenda, with the Iran situation, black Chicago pastors are embracing
[11:16.000 --> 11:21.440]  more libertarian Republican candidates like Rand Paul, slacked of a Susan Sarandon too
[11:21.440 --> 11:23.720]  lazy to wear anti-gun t-shirt.
[11:23.720 --> 11:30.240]  That ties into John Kuzak, who I think is a great actor, talks love and mercy.
[11:30.240 --> 11:35.920]  It's a Daily Beast article and says Obama is worse than Bush.
[11:35.920 --> 11:42.200]  So again, another example of that electronic Berlin wall having more and more holes poked
[11:42.200 --> 11:46.760]  in it.
[11:46.760 --> 11:55.040]  Ray Kurzweil says humans will be hybrids by 2030, that's in my technology stack.
[11:55.040 --> 12:03.680]  Boehner says they don't have the votes yet on trade deal but it remains secret.
[12:03.680 --> 12:13.560]  They're moving to give Obama new secret powers.
[12:13.560 --> 12:20.880]  UN climate regime says that the UN must bypass the US Congress to save the earth, of course,
[12:20.880 --> 12:24.240]  not a power grab.
[12:24.240 --> 12:27.160]  We're going to be breaking it all down today.
[12:27.160 --> 12:34.720]  Paul Watson had police creeping around his house and in his backyard yesterday and then
[12:34.720 --> 12:40.120]  as soon as he went out to talk to them, they ran off.
[12:40.120 --> 12:44.200]  That's probably tied to Bilderberg.
[12:44.200 --> 12:50.880]  I myself had local police, county police, regional police, MI5, you name it, waiting
[12:50.880 --> 12:59.520]  for me at the airport and at my hotel and when I would walk out to the car, I had different
[12:59.520 --> 13:06.560]  visits with I guess four different agencies when I went to cover Bilderberg north of London
[13:06.560 --> 13:11.600]  in Watford three years ago.
[13:11.600 --> 13:15.360]  Hard to believe it's that long ago already.
[13:15.360 --> 13:23.160]  David Knight had similar run-ins last year in Copenhagen, Denmark.
[13:23.160 --> 13:30.800]  Well, this year it's in a rural mountainous area of the Austrian Alps and it's in local
[13:30.800 --> 13:37.320]  German newspapers and local Austrian newspapers, mainline newspapers that within five miles
[13:37.320 --> 13:42.360]  of it because it's a popular skiing and hiking area, there are federal police and you can't
[13:42.360 --> 13:52.080]  make this up, I'm not joking, Cobra security, hail Cobra, Cobra security will be providing
[13:52.080 --> 14:02.480]  security for the Bilderberg group, Destro will be in the woods checking everyone's IDs.
[14:02.480 --> 14:06.680]  And yes, there'll be international arms dealers and other Cobra like individuals inside the
[14:06.680 --> 14:10.560]  meeting which didn't exist in mainstream media until about 10 years ago.
[14:10.560 --> 14:17.040]  We, I and many others like Jim Tucker, forced it, you forced it into mainstream news.
[14:17.040 --> 14:21.320]  The U.S. still will deny it exists sometimes, they'll have articles schizophrenically saying
[14:21.320 --> 14:24.920]  it doesn't exist for totally insane in the New York Times and then I'm wandering around
[14:24.920 --> 14:30.640]  having a full blown schizophrenic hallucination in Virginia when they're having the meeting.
[14:30.640 --> 14:39.160]  Helicopters, a secret service, Marines, video of it, secret service, lifting up MP5, hecklers,
[14:39.160 --> 14:44.880]  HK's, Obama and Hillary go in, no one knows where they are for a day, it's all over the
[14:44.880 --> 14:49.280]  news, they've disappeared, they were supposed to be on an airplane, they slam the door,
[14:49.280 --> 14:55.760]  fly to Chicago, we go find them, call the media and they respond by having Marines in
[14:55.760 --> 15:00.160]  plain clothes try to set us up for terrorism.
[15:00.160 --> 15:02.640]  That's America, folks.
[15:02.640 --> 15:06.720]  And believe me, big decisions are being made at this one, they have the hotel shut down
[15:06.720 --> 15:13.960]  a full week before, that's never been done, this big luxury hotel.
[15:13.960 --> 15:19.320]  I do have part of their agenda now from one of my sources, it just dovetails with their
[15:19.320 --> 15:23.080]  Davos announcements and other statements.
[15:23.080 --> 15:29.360]  They will now publish a day before it starts generally, part of their agenda, that will
[15:29.360 --> 15:32.920]  only be the cover agenda.
[15:32.920 --> 15:37.920]  They don't like the fact that we go in beforehand, talk to the workers and say when they're totally
[15:37.920 --> 15:41.880]  rude to you and mean to you and you hear horrible things being said, you won't want to talk
[15:41.880 --> 15:46.080]  to me now, you're going to be threatened with a rest or being fired or whatever, but you
[15:46.080 --> 15:53.520]  can come to whatever bar you choose at said time and give us intel.
[15:53.520 --> 15:56.520]  If you want to, and they're always never, I'm never going to talk to you, you go to
[15:56.520 --> 16:01.960]  the bar or you go to the restaurant or you go to the park and they show up, they're like
[16:01.960 --> 16:06.920]  it is horrible, they say they will enslave everyone and will implode economy as soon
[16:06.920 --> 16:12.440]  as they can and take everyone's children basically and you cannot look them in the eyes, they
[16:12.440 --> 16:15.960]  are so horrible, they are evil.
[16:15.960 --> 16:20.120]  These are the conversations, Jim Tucker started doing that 30 something years ago, of course
[16:20.120 --> 16:27.200]  he died two years ago or a year and a half ago, God rest his soul, but he was just a
[16:27.200 --> 16:31.200]  mainline crime and sports writer for big syndicates across the country, he was editor
[16:31.200 --> 16:38.200]  of major newspapers and he read articles by the late grade at that time, Westbrook Pegler
[16:38.200 --> 16:43.920]  from a decade before that one of his readers sent him about a secret group meeting once
[16:43.920 --> 16:47.520]  a year setting agenda and he said, that's impossible, I'd know about it, be all over
[16:47.520 --> 16:55.760]  the news, world leaders meeting in secret, it's like a G20 meeting in secret and there's
[16:55.760 --> 16:59.320]  other secret meetings too, but this is the one that blows them all wide open, it's basically
[16:59.320 --> 17:09.000]  a specter meeting, what it is, a specter meeting and they don't like people looking into it
[17:09.000 --> 17:13.120]  so that's why it's a big deal, some people say, why even cover it and yet it's expensive
[17:13.120 --> 17:21.800]  to send three reporters to Europe, it's expensive, but we've now exposed it exists, now people
[17:21.800 --> 17:28.640]  listen we can expose the agenda, our intel ends up being in newspapers around the world
[17:28.640 --> 17:33.480]  and we reach tens of millions of new people and so now they want us to say, okay we're
[17:33.480 --> 17:38.240]  meeting a secret big deal, move along, no you said you didn't exist, now you exist,
[17:38.240 --> 17:43.000]  you're violating all sorts of different laws in different countries, the Logan Act here,
[17:43.000 --> 17:49.160]  meeting in secret setting policy and here are the annals leaked, I mean I've been at
[17:49.160 --> 17:56.040]  Bilderberg in Virginia a few years ago, they have it every fourth year here in Chantella
[17:56.040 --> 18:03.280]  usually, in between all these defense contractor complexes there's a five star Marriott conference
[18:03.280 --> 18:15.120]  hotel and you know just a vet pulls up on a big Harley and says I'm giving you stuff
[18:15.120 --> 18:21.760]  out of the National Archives that is restricted and it says not for release on the top and
[18:21.760 --> 18:27.520]  it's, we published them, famous U.S. Senator, eight different years of the annals, meeting
[18:27.520 --> 18:31.720]  in secret, the Rockefellers, the heads of the unions, how to sell America out, how to
[18:31.720 --> 18:41.200]  take over the economy and it's from the 60s, early 60s, hundreds of pages of it, I mean
[18:41.200 --> 18:49.120]  that's the type of stuff we get when we're at these events and it was just a veteran
[18:49.120 --> 18:54.880]  who works in the National Archives and he said you couldn't believe what's in there,
[18:54.880 --> 19:00.080]  he goes a lot of it's classified, I can't tell you but this is just restricted, he
[19:00.080 --> 19:07.080]  goes I could probably get fired for this but here it is and then separately part of those
[19:07.080 --> 19:11.280]  annals had already been released before and it was confirmed those were real annals stamped
[19:11.280 --> 19:17.240]  National Archives and this is what's going on folks, this is where the real decisions
[19:17.240 --> 19:23.400]  are being made, just like we can't see the Trans-Pacific Partnership and it's all secret
[19:23.400 --> 19:28.800]  and we're just told let these people decide and we can't even find out who's involved,
[19:28.800 --> 19:36.120]  this is ruled by secrecy, this is global totalitarian corporate fascism, Paul Watson has got some
[19:36.120 --> 19:42.360]  of the same sorts as I've got, we're working together, tomorrow, it may be Monday but we
[19:42.360 --> 19:45.200]  don't like to release stuff on Friday but we like to release it when we have it and
[19:45.200 --> 19:51.280]  it's ready, it's ready, maybe even today, we've learned part of the major agenda of
[19:51.280 --> 19:57.840]  Bilderberg and we're going to be publishing that very, very soon, very important information
[19:57.840 --> 20:00.200]  and that's all coming up as well, he'll be joining us.

[20:59.560 --> 21:03.760]  On the average Americans work between 45 to 50 years hoping to build up enough wealth
[21:03.760 --> 21:08.800]  to retire and live out their golden years, unfortunately with taxation, the rising cost
[21:08.800 --> 21:13.640]  of food, energy, housing and medical, many retirees are forced to live below the poverty
[21:13.640 --> 21:18.000]  line, is this a flaw for enterprise or is our monetary unit we call the Federal Reserve
[21:18.000 --> 21:23.120]  Note forcing us into perpetual debt, ensuring inflation and higher taxes, these questions
[21:23.120 --> 21:26.880]  and more can be answered by reading G. Edward Griffin's book, The Creature from Jekyll
[21:26.880 --> 21:31.440]  Island, Congressman Ron Paul states it's what every American needs to know about central
[21:31.440 --> 21:36.720]  bank power, a gripping adventure into the secret world of international banking cartel.
[21:36.720 --> 21:41.180]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson, I will give a silver dollar from the early 1900s to anyone who

[21:58.720 --> 22:03.800]  Are you suffering from EP, the symptoms include fraudulent charges to your credit card, your
[22:03.800 --> 22:07.360]  subway card says it's empty but you bought it yesterday, someone's been in your hotel
[22:07.360 --> 22:12.000]  room but the desk clerk says they only show you entering the room, these are signs of
[22:12.000 --> 22:17.800]  EP, electronic pickpocketing, payment cards, transit cards, even hotel room keys, use a
[22:17.800 --> 22:22.240]  radio chip so you can just wave your card at the register, the turnstile or your hotel
[22:22.240 --> 22:27.120]  room door, but what's convenient for you is also convenient for thieves, waving scanners
[22:27.120 --> 22:30.280]  to electronically pickpocket you without even touching you.
[22:30.280 --> 22:35.800]  The good news is there's a cure, ID Stronghold has created leather wallets and clutches that
[22:35.800 --> 22:40.840]  have built in EP protection, layers of shielding material, cleverly concealed in a beautiful
[22:40.840 --> 22:43.800]  leather wallet that stops the symptoms of EP.

[24:19.440 --> 24:47.040]  We go to DrudgeReport.com, we have the same smattering of breaking news and info wars.com
[24:47.040 --> 24:54.920]  and I like how Drudge presents it, big giant bold red letters, Obama trade, global access
[24:54.920 --> 25:02.440]  to citizens data, Boehner pushes new secret White House powers, tech still hidden in capital
[25:02.440 --> 25:09.880]  basement and you notice on Monday I began thrashing on Sunday and Monday, Julian Assange
[25:09.880 --> 25:16.200]  and I don't want to attack Julian Assange, I haven't made my mind up about it.
[25:16.200 --> 25:17.200]  What's going on there?
[25:17.200 --> 25:22.960]  It looks like he's a conduit for different agencies and governments and corporations
[25:22.960 --> 25:28.920]  to battle with each other, a lot of smart money says the same thing but the issue is
[25:28.920 --> 25:31.840]  it doesn't matter, we want the data.
[25:31.840 --> 25:39.120]  They said a year and a half ago that they had the whole 30 plus part trade deal, then
[25:39.120 --> 25:45.920]  they said it was only 28 pieces, okay and now 27 pieces and I said what are you doing
[25:45.920 --> 25:50.520]  but not releasing it and I went back to the news, they had said back then that they had
[25:50.520 --> 25:57.760]  the whole thing and they have these fundraisers where they say there's a bounty or if you
[25:57.760 --> 26:02.720]  help us raise funds we'll release this or we'll release that, then they spun it yesterday
[26:02.720 --> 26:11.040]  let us raise $100,000 that was in Reuters, WikiLeaks offers $100,000 bounty for Asian
[26:11.040 --> 26:17.800]  trade pack pushed by Obama and then now today they say they have it and they've released
[26:17.800 --> 26:24.520]  part of it and it basically puts all your medical data, your financial data, everything
[26:24.520 --> 26:28.960]  into a big giant global database, here's the truth it's already been done, they're just
[26:28.960 --> 26:37.360]  going to try to certify this fraud, this is global government and so now they've released
[26:37.360 --> 26:44.640]  it, whether they had it before or didn't is a bit foggy but we have the trade and services
[26:44.640 --> 26:53.440]  agreement, WikiLeaks released today 17 secret documents from the ongoing TISA trade and
[26:53.440 --> 26:57.560]  services agreement negotiations which cover the United States, the European Union and
[26:57.560 --> 27:02.240]  23 other countries including Turkey, Mexico, Canada, Australia, Pakistan, Taiwan, Israel
[27:02.240 --> 27:11.400]  which together compromise two-thirds of global GDP and then they go through it, Forbes now
[27:11.400 --> 27:20.240]  breaks it down, leaked documents reveal privacy threat and Forbes goes over the documents,
[27:20.240 --> 27:24.040]  we can put WikiLeaks up on screen and click and show folks those documents of your TV
[27:24.040 --> 27:33.720]  viewer that basically eviscerate what privacy you have left and then hands your data over
[27:33.720 --> 27:40.080]  to all these financial institutions, corporate institutions and others who already form a
[27:40.080 --> 27:45.840]  bigger threat to our liberties than government and I had a former top NSA officer on the
[27:45.840 --> 27:52.440]  broadcast yesterday agreeing that it's a corporate fascist takeover and that the new USA Freedom
[27:52.440 --> 27:58.760]  Act to replace the Patriot Act is worse in many respects and simply legalizes what corporations
[27:58.760 --> 28:05.560]  are already doing storing and using everything you do, your data down to audio, video, text,
[28:05.560 --> 28:12.880]  emails, your shopping habits, your credit card info, your social security, all of it
[28:12.880 --> 28:16.400]  and then as the data breaches get worse and worse they're going to push global standardized
[28:16.400 --> 28:22.000]  data attached to biometrics, retina scanning, face scanning, voice print, hand print, thumb
[28:22.000 --> 28:27.240]  print, index fingerprint and then you're going to have to biometrically scan to buy and sell
[28:27.240 --> 28:33.200]  and to get online and buy, this has all been proposed for a decade.
[28:33.200 --> 28:38.080]  So then you can be tracked with your internet ID and you can be banned from the internet
[28:38.080 --> 28:46.120]  after three global offenses that the TPP in its UN document section on the internet shows
[28:46.120 --> 28:50.800]  they plan to tax the internet, track the internet, trace everything you're doing and then if
[28:50.800 --> 28:57.720]  they claim you violate something copyright or hate laws or whatever the case is, three
[28:57.720 --> 29:08.200]  strikes no judge, no jury, you will be banned from the internet like a convicted hacker.
[29:08.200 --> 29:15.440]  Globally you're going to have to thumb print that's why all the new Microsoft software
[29:15.440 --> 29:19.760]  for at least six, seven years coming out to access it, it already has it in place that
[29:19.760 --> 29:29.360]  you'll have to biometrically thumb print or index print to be able to do that.
[29:29.360 --> 29:36.400]  It's simply over the top insane and remember, now two sections of 20 plus are public I want
[29:36.400 --> 29:41.440]  WikiLeaks to release it all, don't dole it out, don't do this, they're trying to pass
[29:41.440 --> 29:47.000]  it in the house right now, it's already passed the senate, release it all WikiLeaks, release
[29:47.000 --> 29:49.840]  it all now.
[30:17.320 --> 30:23.200]  their position with airstrikes. Talk about a major shift in narrative since the beginning
[30:23.200 --> 30:28.600]  of Syria's so-called civil war, the Obama administration has funded an armed radical
[30:28.600 --> 30:33.400]  Islamist under the guise of supporting moderate rebels. Last February, the president even
[30:33.400 --> 30:39.180]  handed the free Syrian army the ability to order U.S. airstrikes and one Jihadist told
[30:39.180 --> 30:45.780]  al-Jazeera in 2013, FSA fighters regularly sell their weapons to ISIS once receiving
[30:45.780 --> 30:50.980]  shipments from the U.S. Well, that's when the U.S. is an accidentally dropping weapons
[30:50.980 --> 30:56.940]  right in ISIS territory. So, who's really trying to bolster their position in Syria?

[31:58.940 --> 32:03.940]  Ladies and gentlemen, you haven't really ever heard firearms manufacturers as sponsors on
[32:03.940 --> 32:08.940]  my syndicated radio show or the nightly news or the news website infowars.com because the
[32:08.940 --> 32:13.940]  companies I've been approached by were not the highest quality and they weren't as affordable
[32:13.940 --> 32:18.940]  as they should be. So, I refused probably 30-40 firearms manufacturers over the years.
[32:18.940 --> 32:25.940]  Well then, about 6 months ago, we get contacted by head down firearms, hdfirearms.com. Own
[32:25.940 --> 32:30.940]  and run by a bunch of former Navy SEALs, special ops people, their veterans, their patriots,

[32:34.940 --> 32:38.940]  about security, whether it's for yourself, your wife, your loved ones. Go to their website

[32:47.940 --> 32:55.940]  store, whatever you do, get your head down firearm today. The spirit of 1776 lives at
[32:55.940 --> 32:59.940]  head down firearms, hdfirearms.com.
[32:59.940 --> 33:04.940]  G.I. Joe
[33:13.940 --> 33:18.940]  You are a programmable guy that goes and watches Olympus is falling and believes all this and
[33:18.940 --> 33:25.940]  really thinks you're a hero. G.I. Joe, great American hero. Joe, Joe. You don't work for Joe.
[33:25.940 --> 33:32.940]  Joe got taken over. The G.I. Joe command base is run by Cobra. You understand that. And
[33:32.940 --> 33:37.940]  I use a child analogy to get through to you because that's your main programming template
[33:37.940 --> 33:42.940]  in North America. They're on record with that. That was all Pentagon directed. You understand
[33:42.940 --> 33:47.940]  you work for Cobra. You dress like Cobra. You have the tactics of Cobra. You are Cobra.
[33:47.940 --> 33:53.940]  You are Cobra. You want to be little boys? Or do you want to really join the Republic?
[33:53.940 --> 33:57.940]  They know what's going on at the Bundy Ranch and they won't even let a police information
[33:57.940 --> 34:00.940]  officer give us any information. That's a bunch of bulls***.
[34:00.940 --> 34:06.940]  It's all these stupid G.I. Joe movies and stuff where the White House is attacked. The White House is run by Cobra.
[34:06.940 --> 34:10.940]  When I went through the process of becoming press secretary, one of the things, one of
[34:10.940 --> 34:14.940]  the first things they told me was you're not even to acknowledge the drone program. You're
[34:14.940 --> 34:17.940]  not even to discuss that it exists.
[34:17.940 --> 34:21.940]  It's run by chaos. It's run by specter.
[34:21.940 --> 34:26.940]  Special executive for counterintelligence, terrorism, revenge, extortion.
[34:26.940 --> 34:30.940]  They run little kids. They run the snuff films. They run the drugs. They run it all.
[34:30.940 --> 34:35.940]  And because you act like a bunch of naive chumps, this whole thing's going to come down on us.
[34:35.940 --> 34:39.940]  Very much concerns me considering that they have all this bulk ammunition that they're
[34:39.940 --> 34:41.940]  shooting targets of children.
[34:41.940 --> 34:44.940]  Would you like to tell me who it is that is doing this?
[34:44.940 --> 34:46.940]  It is the Department of Homeland Security, sir.
[34:46.940 --> 34:48.940]  Oh, thank you for calling.
[34:48.940 --> 34:52.940]  One click to every police officer in this country, to every FBI agent, to every secret
[34:52.940 --> 34:58.940]  service agent. You work for specter. You work for chaos. You work for Cobra.
[35:01.940 --> 35:07.940]  How do they get power? They stage a terror attack using specter, using Cobra.
[35:11.940 --> 35:12.940]  Go f**k yourself.
[35:12.940 --> 35:17.940]  Who is Cobra? Arms dealing, drug dealing, money laundering group, wearing masks?
[35:17.940 --> 35:21.940]  They wear masks, ladies and gentlemen, because they're the corporate CEOs.
[35:21.940 --> 35:24.940]  And they're manipulating the governments against each other.
[35:24.940 --> 35:30.940]  Cobra runs the Muslims. Cobra runs the CIA. Cobra runs it all. Cobra is real.
[35:30.940 --> 35:33.940]  You can call it whatever you want.
[35:33.940 --> 35:38.940]  Cobra is in control of America. And Cobra says the veterans and the gun owners,
[35:38.940 --> 35:41.940]  they're saying that we're the bad guys.
[35:41.940 --> 35:47.940]  These people who hold themselves out to be patriots are not. They're nothing more
[35:47.940 --> 35:49.940]  than domestic terrorists.
[35:49.940 --> 35:52.940]  That's what Cobra would say. That's what specter would say.
[35:52.940 --> 35:56.940]  That's what Goldfinger would say, because that's who those people are.
[35:56.940 --> 36:01.940]  I am Supreme Cobra Commander.
[36:01.940 --> 36:06.940]  You call your penny bureaucrats officials and authorities.
[36:06.940 --> 36:13.940]  You will kneel before Cobra or face my wrath.
[36:13.940 --> 36:17.940]  Resistance to tyrants is obedience to God.
[36:17.940 --> 36:19.940]  He will give me the challenge.
[36:19.940 --> 36:21.940]  Thank you for joining us.
[36:21.940 --> 36:23.940]  Mr. Cobra Leader.
[36:23.940 --> 36:29.940]  You pathetic little worm. How dare you call me Mr. Cobra?
[36:33.940 --> 36:35.940]  Cobra.
[36:35.940 --> 36:39.940]  And you can go to infowars.com and read the news article that links directly to
[36:39.940 --> 36:46.940]  mainstream Austrian newspapers that Cobra's security based in Austria in a
[36:46.940 --> 36:51.940]  17th century castle nearby will be running security for Bilderberg.
[36:51.940 --> 36:57.940]  That's right. Cobra's security that wear black uniforms and are based in a castle
[36:57.940 --> 37:01.940]  will be providing security for the criminals at Bilderberg.
[37:01.940 --> 37:04.940]  There's the headline. Cobra, Bilderberg's weapon of choice.
[37:04.940 --> 37:09.940]  Extra Special Police Forces, known as Cobra, will be called in to operate
[37:09.940 --> 37:11.940]  security during the secretive meeting.
[37:11.940 --> 37:15.940]  And it's already in local papers yesterday that they are fanning out around
[37:15.940 --> 37:21.940]  local towns and in the forest and mountains, stopping skiers, stopping
[37:21.940 --> 37:25.940]  hikers and demanding their IDs, putting them in a database.
[37:25.940 --> 37:30.940]  As if it's illegal that reporters would want to come cover 150 world leaders,
[37:30.940 --> 37:35.940]  Dutch, British royalty, the Rockefellers, the Rothschilds, the heads of
[37:35.940 --> 37:40.940]  Google, the heads of Microsoft, the head of Facebook, you know, the
[37:40.940 --> 37:46.940]  Crown Prince of Saudi Arabia, you know, the Chinese Secretary of State.
[37:46.940 --> 37:52.940]  I mean, that's the president of Spain.
[37:52.940 --> 37:55.940]  That's who goes to Bilderberg. I mean, last year they're like, it's preposterous.
[37:55.940 --> 37:59.940]  The Prime Minister will be here. Jones, shut up two days before.
[37:59.940 --> 38:04.940]  Then here comes the, you know, helicopter landing with the Prime Minister.
[38:04.940 --> 38:11.940]  And they had federal cops following us around as if we didn't notice them.
[38:11.940 --> 38:14.940]  And then after these guys' suits come over and they're like, thanks a lot for
[38:14.940 --> 38:18.940]  our custody problem. Like, I'm going to cause, quote, quote, problems.
[38:18.940 --> 38:21.940]  The people inside there are causing the problems.
[38:21.940 --> 38:25.940]  I'm shining a spotlight on roaches.
[38:25.940 --> 38:29.940]  I have no history of criminal activity, no history of assaulting
[38:29.940 --> 38:32.940]  anybody that didn't assault me first.
[38:32.940 --> 38:35.940]  I am there assaulting people with the truth.
[38:35.940 --> 38:38.940]  So I'll say, I'll say now I can do every year.
[38:38.940 --> 38:43.940]  Paul Watson, Rob Do, Josh Owens that are going, two from the U.S.,
[38:43.940 --> 38:47.940]  one from Britannia, one from the U.K.
[38:47.940 --> 38:50.940]  When the federal police, or walk over, what are you planning?
[38:50.940 --> 38:52.940]  Go, hey, you're trying to turn this around.
[38:52.940 --> 38:54.940]  We did something wrong. We're journalists.
[38:54.940 --> 38:56.940]  We're going to press, watch out.
[38:56.940 --> 38:58.940]  There's going to be a major international incident in the news.
[38:58.940 --> 39:01.940]  Stop bowing up. Stop putting your hand on your gun.
[39:01.940 --> 39:03.940]  Stop threatening to ride us tickets.
[39:03.940 --> 39:07.940]  And they'll be just like the Austrian police or the Switzerland police,
[39:07.940 --> 39:11.940]  the Swiss police. Years ago, they totally backed down.
[39:11.940 --> 39:14.940]  It's all psychologically. You got to go.
[39:14.940 --> 39:17.940]  Hey, you live in a free country.
[39:17.940 --> 39:20.940]  You claim Austria is free. You claim England's free.
[39:20.940 --> 39:22.940]  You claim the U.S. is free.
[39:22.940 --> 39:28.940]  The cops were saying we couldn't walk across the street at a crosswalk.
[39:28.940 --> 39:31.940]  The London Guardian reported on this.
[39:31.940 --> 39:33.940]  And I went over to the head cop in Virginia and I said,
[39:33.940 --> 39:35.940]  you're going to go ahead and arrest us.
[39:35.940 --> 39:37.940]  And I said, I don't say this because I hate cops or I hate you,
[39:37.940 --> 39:39.940]  but you ought to be ashamed of yourself.
[39:39.940 --> 39:41.940]  Your kids aren't going to live in a free country.
[39:41.940 --> 39:44.940]  How dare you follow those criminal's orders inside.
[39:44.940 --> 39:46.940]  Try to keep us from demonstrating.
[39:46.940 --> 39:50.940]  You already had your colleague, the captain, telling the hotel I'm at,
[39:50.940 --> 39:53.940]  not to bring me here on a shuttle bus.
[39:53.940 --> 39:55.940]  You're impeding my rights.
[39:55.940 --> 39:58.940]  And I said, go ahead. We're going to walk across this crosswalk.
[39:58.940 --> 40:00.940]  And if you want to arrest us, that's fine.
[40:00.940 --> 40:02.940]  But it's not just that I'm going to sue you.
[40:02.940 --> 40:04.940]  I probably won't even sue you.
[40:04.940 --> 40:07.940]  I tell you what, you go ahead and you kill your children's future.
[40:07.940 --> 40:09.940]  This was in the newspaper.
[40:09.940 --> 40:11.940]  I mean, the Guardian was sitting there watching this.
[40:11.940 --> 40:14.940]  Because for hours, the cops were going to arrest you.
[40:14.940 --> 40:16.940]  We're going to arrest you. I said, fine, arrest us.
[40:16.940 --> 40:18.940]  And we walked across live on the radio.
[40:18.940 --> 40:20.940]  Everybody's like, incredible. Yay, Alex.
[40:20.940 --> 40:22.940]  And I said, yay.
[40:22.940 --> 40:25.940]  We had to have a confrontation with the police
[40:25.940 --> 40:28.940]  to be able to walk across a stinking crosswalk
[40:28.940 --> 40:31.940]  outside of the hotel grounds.
[40:31.940 --> 40:35.940]  As tax-paying American citizens, they can just spend our rights
[40:35.940 --> 40:38.940]  because we dare come with cameras and microphones
[40:38.940 --> 40:43.940]  and bull horns to let a bunch of world globalist garbage
[40:43.940 --> 40:46.940]  that are usurping our freedoms.
[40:46.940 --> 40:48.940]  Yeah, there was the headline.
[40:48.940 --> 40:50.940]  Bilderberg 2012, one in Guardian.
[40:50.940 --> 40:54.940]  Protesters hail their hero, Alex Jones.
[40:54.940 --> 40:57.940]  And the cops started trying to say, you know,
[40:57.940 --> 41:02.940]  we're just not going to allow demonstrations, period, a day before.
[41:02.940 --> 41:04.940]  And I just looked at this.
[41:04.940 --> 41:06.940]  It was one of the cops was really bad.
[41:06.940 --> 41:08.940]  He was always trying to set us up and lying.
[41:08.940 --> 41:10.940]  And the others were pretty good.
[41:10.940 --> 41:12.940]  And I just said, man, shame on you.
[41:12.940 --> 41:15.940]  I said, go ahead and try to arrest people for peacefully demonstrating.
[41:15.940 --> 41:16.940]  Go ahead.
[41:16.940 --> 41:17.940]  What are you doing?
[41:17.940 --> 41:20.940]  Auditioning for a job in Tiananmen Square.
[41:20.940 --> 41:23.940]  And it's not like we were protesting on somebody's private property.
[41:23.940 --> 41:25.940]  We were on the sidewalk.
[41:25.940 --> 41:27.940]  It's America, remember?
[41:27.940 --> 41:31.940]  And look, TPP, the climate's changed.
[41:31.940 --> 41:34.940]  We now can get people to admit there's a TPP.
[41:34.940 --> 41:39.940]  The TPP started in 2004.
[41:39.940 --> 41:42.940]  And back then I would cover it and I would have reporters at my office
[41:42.940 --> 41:46.940]  calling me going, and you claim they're setting up an Asian union
[41:46.940 --> 41:47.940]  through a trade pact.
[41:47.940 --> 41:50.940]  And I'd go, yeah, it's in these policy reports.
[41:50.940 --> 41:52.940]  They've been meeting in secret for a couple of years.
[41:52.940 --> 41:56.940]  And they'd go, Mr. Jones, no one's meeting in secret for global deals.
[41:56.940 --> 41:59.940]  That's all done out in the open.
[41:59.940 --> 42:02.940]  No one wants global government.
[42:02.940 --> 42:05.940]  Now we've gotten to the point where their stonewalling doesn't work,
[42:05.940 --> 42:07.940]  kind of like with Obamacare.
[42:07.940 --> 42:10.940]  It doesn't work to say it doesn't increase your prices anymore.
[42:10.940 --> 42:14.940]  And then it cuts them when everybody's seen their prices go up.
[42:14.940 --> 42:17.940]  50 to three times.
[42:17.940 --> 42:22.940]  50% is the low end, three times for others.
[42:22.940 --> 42:24.940]  Mine's gone up 100%.
[42:24.940 --> 42:29.940]  My parents have gone up 100% with no claims.
[42:29.940 --> 42:31.940]  100%.
[42:31.940 --> 42:32.940]  We've got insurance.
[42:32.940 --> 42:37.940]  If somebody has a baby or if you roll a car, your back's broken.
[42:37.940 --> 42:40.940]  To keep our insurance low, my dad always taught me just to have insurance
[42:40.940 --> 42:42.940]  but pay for small stuff.
[42:42.940 --> 42:44.940]  That doesn't matter anymore.
[42:44.940 --> 42:46.940]  Good behavior doesn't matter anymore.
[42:46.940 --> 42:52.940]  Being a good customer doesn't matter anymore because they wrote a law to screw everybody.
[42:52.940 --> 42:58.940]  And now GOP is open to extending Obamacare subsidies.
[42:58.940 --> 43:01.940]  And select corporations, they get to opt out of it,
[43:01.940 --> 43:05.940]  which again is not a level playing field with their competition.
[43:05.940 --> 43:08.940]  I'm going to go to Paul Joseph Watson,
[43:08.940 --> 43:11.940]  who is going to be spearheading our operations,
[43:11.940 --> 43:17.940]  m4s.com, Nightly News Director Rob Duel will be there supporting him.
[43:17.940 --> 43:24.940]  So will our great cameraman and editor and journalist as well, Josh Owens.
[43:24.940 --> 43:27.940]  But the issue here is people now get ruled by secrecy.
[43:27.940 --> 43:32.940]  They now understand there are big shadowy organizations taking control.
[43:32.940 --> 43:37.940]  They now understand that foreign owned energy companies are moving into the US
[43:37.940 --> 43:42.940]  and shutting down US companies and city and county owned power plants.
[43:42.940 --> 43:45.940]  People understand their water districts being taken over
[43:45.940 --> 43:48.940]  and handed over pennies on the dollar and their prices double or triple.
[43:48.940 --> 43:50.940]  People understand looting is beginning.
[43:50.940 --> 43:58.940]  It's not privatization, it's pirate privatization.
[43:58.940 --> 44:00.940]  It's piratical.
[44:00.940 --> 44:04.940]  And now it's coming out leaked TISA documents from the TPP
[44:04.940 --> 44:06.940]  saying that your privacy is over.
[44:06.940 --> 44:09.940]  All your data is given to corporations, foreign governments, everything pooled
[44:09.940 --> 44:11.940]  under an ultramassive system.
[44:11.940 --> 44:13.940]  It shuts down competition.
[44:13.940 --> 44:15.940]  It doesn't let you open businesses where you want.
[44:15.940 --> 44:18.940]  It's super events and circumvents Congress.
[44:18.940 --> 44:21.940]  I mean, here it is today.
[44:21.940 --> 44:23.940]  New American Magazine.
[44:23.940 --> 44:25.940]  You and climate regime must bypass US Congress.
[44:25.940 --> 44:29.940]  French court rules to save the world for global warming.
[44:29.940 --> 44:31.940]  And they're now saying that our Constitution is trumped.
[44:31.940 --> 44:34.940]  This is global government.
[44:34.940 --> 44:37.940]  And Boehner says he doesn't have the votes yet,
[44:37.940 --> 44:39.940]  but he thinks he'll have them soon in the Hill reports.
[44:39.940 --> 44:42.940]  But they still won't release the text.
[44:42.940 --> 44:47.940]  Well, a whole new subsection has been released by WikiLeaks.
[44:47.940 --> 44:50.940]  And it's just nightmare.
[44:50.940 --> 44:53.940]  Why aren't they releasing the rest?
[44:53.940 --> 44:57.940]  Because WikiLeaks tied in with the Democratic Party
[44:57.940 --> 45:02.940]  and leftist organizations worldwide doesn't want the gun control provisions
[45:02.940 --> 45:09.940]  that senators have told gun owners of America privately are in there.
[45:09.940 --> 45:11.940]  Of course, it's in there. Obama said it's in there.
[45:11.940 --> 45:13.940]  It's in the UN treaty.
[45:13.940 --> 45:15.940]  And the open borders garbage.
[45:15.940 --> 45:17.940]  The left wants that gun control.
[45:17.940 --> 45:20.940]  The left wants those open borders.
[45:20.940 --> 45:23.940]  The left wants the high taxes.
[45:23.940 --> 45:29.940]  They want the global carbon tax that is admittedly submitted
[45:29.940 --> 45:33.940]  through trade deals that are added as a carbon tariff
[45:33.940 --> 45:39.940]  that's been paid into a international global governance funding mechanism.
[45:39.940 --> 45:42.940]  So see, that's why Bilderberg is important,
[45:42.940 --> 45:48.940]  because it's another window into all the secretive activity that's going on.
[45:48.940 --> 45:51.940]  Joining us from the United Kingdom in London is Paul Watson.
[45:51.940 --> 45:54.940]  He tweeted yesterday that police were running around in his yard
[45:54.940 --> 45:56.940]  and then ran off when he went outside.
[45:56.940 --> 45:59.940]  He's trying to be stoic and saying it's probably no big deal.
[45:59.940 --> 46:04.940]  Paul, I think it's probably 50% chance that it has to do with Bilderberg.
[46:04.940 --> 46:10.940]  But see, Bilderberg will do stuff like spoof your house for a SWAT team raid.
[46:10.940 --> 46:14.940]  Or if you were married, they'd call up and threaten to cut your wife's head off.
[46:14.940 --> 46:16.940]  I've had them do that when I'm at Bilderberg.
[46:16.940 --> 46:18.940]  They're calling back home threatening my family
[46:18.940 --> 46:22.940]  and listening to the phone calls and then telling your wife or your spouse
[46:22.940 --> 46:25.940]  what you were just talking about on the phone to mess with them.
[46:25.940 --> 46:28.940]  No caller ID comes up.
[46:28.940 --> 46:33.940]  It may not be Bilderberg, but it could be.
[46:33.940 --> 46:37.940]  They may put in the Interpol database just to mess with you that you're a narcotics trafficker.
[46:37.940 --> 46:41.940]  And then they'll take it out later once the low-level police find out it's not true.
[46:41.940 --> 46:43.940]  They'll go, oh, that's an error. Sorry.
[46:43.940 --> 46:45.940]  But this is what Bilderberg is able to do,
[46:45.940 --> 46:50.940]  because most of the hotel is just filled with government agencies and spy groups,
[46:50.940 --> 46:53.940]  all spying on other governments that are there.
[46:53.940 --> 46:57.940]  So it's a huge secret summit, more important than the G20.
[46:57.940 --> 47:00.940]  And so we commend your courage to go cover it.
[47:00.940 --> 47:02.940]  I need to talk to you after the show today.
[47:02.940 --> 47:04.940]  I've got major intel on Bilderberg.
[47:04.940 --> 47:10.940]  I know you were passed some of the sources and are able to ferret that.
[47:10.940 --> 47:21.940]  Paul, when are you planning first to release what we know about the true Bilderberg agenda this year?
[47:21.940 --> 47:25.940]  I'm going to do a video on it this weekend, so it'll be out Monday.
[47:25.940 --> 47:29.940]  And then we'll have the article version of that as well with all the hyperlinks.
[47:29.940 --> 47:33.940]  So that'll be out on Monday with what we know about the agenda so far.
[47:33.940 --> 47:38.940]  And obviously we're going to get more information and put out more articles in the days after that.
[47:38.940 --> 47:40.940]  Now, they've got the hotel shut down a week before.
[47:40.940 --> 47:42.940]  I would like you to go early.
[47:42.940 --> 47:44.940]  And I mean, obviously they're going to try to throw you out or whatever.
[47:44.940 --> 47:45.940]  But so what?
[47:45.940 --> 47:47.940]  You're just there trying to cover it as a journalist.
[47:47.940 --> 47:51.940]  They try to act like criminals were not.
[47:51.940 --> 47:56.940]  No, I mean, the thing you mentioned before, you know, when Bilderberg was in Watford,
[47:56.940 --> 48:00.940]  they called us all up like three days before, four days before.
[48:00.940 --> 48:02.940]  And basically made it known that we were on the list.
[48:02.940 --> 48:07.940]  We wouldn't be allowed to stay in the hotel before days before Bilderberg even started.
[48:07.940 --> 48:12.940]  And then the head security guy at the Grove, we asked him directly, you know, why,
[48:12.940 --> 48:13.940]  why were we kicked out?
[48:13.940 --> 48:15.940]  And he said, basically, you're on a list.
[48:15.940 --> 48:18.940]  It's special branch British intelligence that are telling us what to do.
[48:18.940 --> 48:19.940]  Well, sure.
[48:19.940 --> 48:20.940]  They showed up.
[48:20.940 --> 48:22.940]  They showed up to talk to us too.
[48:22.940 --> 48:23.940]  Yeah.
[48:23.940 --> 48:26.940]  So I've been on that list since at least 2013.
[48:26.940 --> 48:30.940]  The thing with the police yesterday, it was definitely odd.
[48:30.940 --> 48:33.940]  I mean, you know, I was just getting out of the shower.
[48:33.940 --> 48:36.940]  There were two cops in my backyard just walking around.
[48:36.940 --> 48:38.940]  There's a loud knock at the door.
[48:38.940 --> 48:43.940]  And this police woman says, and this isn't a hot, you know, early summer's day.
[48:43.940 --> 48:45.940]  I'm airing out the living room.
[48:45.940 --> 48:49.940]  My window was slightly open and she's like, your window was open.
[48:49.940 --> 48:51.940]  We thought you were being burgled.
[48:51.940 --> 48:52.940]  I'm like, oh, okay.
[48:52.940 --> 48:53.940]  And she says, I've shut it now.
[48:53.940 --> 48:54.940]  It's okay.
[48:54.940 --> 48:58.940]  And she was like, there are two cops in your backyard looking around as well.
[48:58.940 --> 49:02.940]  So when they talk about a nanny state, talk about a nanny state where in the summer,
[49:02.940 --> 49:05.940]  you can't open your window.
[49:05.940 --> 49:07.940]  But she said, oh, I've shut your window.
[49:07.940 --> 49:09.940]  And then I looked and she didn't even shut it.
[49:09.940 --> 49:12.940]  It was just bizarre because it's never happened before.
[49:12.940 --> 49:14.940]  You know, it's probably nothing.
[49:14.940 --> 49:16.940]  But as you said, one week before.
[49:16.940 --> 49:21.940]  We're just on special branch list and, you know, had to meet with all these feds and everything.
[49:21.940 --> 49:23.940]  And, you know, had helicopters following us around.
[49:23.940 --> 49:25.940]  But, but nothing's going on.
[49:25.940 --> 49:30.940]  I mean, we went to see Stonehenge and had a car following us 100 miles out of the way.
[49:30.940 --> 49:32.940]  So, I mean, it's ridiculous.
[49:32.940 --> 49:37.940]  Everybody knows who we are. We're journalists who are covering a global event.
[49:37.940 --> 49:38.940]  It's simple.
[49:38.940 --> 49:40.940]  We're a known quantity.
[49:40.940 --> 49:41.940]  It's ridiculous.
[49:41.940 --> 49:45.940]  But they do all this to play act like journalism is illegal.
[49:45.940 --> 49:48.940]  But see, Paul, how we don't make a big deal out of all this.
[49:48.940 --> 49:52.940]  It's sensational that journalists were put on a special branch list.
[49:52.940 --> 49:55.940]  I don't think we ever, which is in Interpol as well.
[49:55.940 --> 49:58.940]  I don't think we've ever even talked about this properly.
[49:58.940 --> 50:00.940]  Why don't you do a story about that?
[50:00.940 --> 50:03.940]  I mean, our lives are so crazy.
[50:03.940 --> 50:04.940]  We're so used to it.
[50:04.940 --> 50:08.940]  We need to telegraph to people how crazy this is, Paul.
[50:08.940 --> 50:11.940]  Well, it was basically a violation of the European Human Rights Act,
[50:11.940 --> 50:17.940]  because that states you can't be discriminated against based on either gender,
[50:17.940 --> 50:21.940]  sexual preference or philosophy, personal philosophy.
[50:21.940 --> 50:24.940]  So those gay people who get denied access at hotels and B&Bs,
[50:24.940 --> 50:27.940]  which happen in a couple of cases, they win all their cases.
[50:27.940 --> 50:31.940]  And I was discriminated against based on my philosophy.
[50:31.940 --> 50:33.940]  They kicked me out based on that solely.
[50:33.940 --> 50:35.940]  How dare you want to know what a bunch of world leaders
[50:35.940 --> 50:37.940]  are meeting in secret deciding your future.
[50:37.940 --> 50:39.940]  And as a journalist, want to cover that.
[50:39.940 --> 50:40.940]  That is just insane.
[50:40.940 --> 50:44.940]  That's like wanting a big glass of ice water in the Sahara Desert.
[50:44.940 --> 50:47.940]  That's like wanting to have a ship when you're out in the ocean.
[50:47.940 --> 50:49.940]  It's like wanting to have air to breathe.
[50:49.940 --> 50:51.940]  It's so weird.
[50:51.940 --> 50:54.940]  So weird that we'd want to know what's in the TPP.
[50:54.940 --> 50:56.940]  So weird.
[50:56.940 --> 50:59.940]  I mean, it's just, we're weird.
[51:26.940 --> 51:29.940]  For more information on the TPP, go to www.TPP.
[51:56.940 --> 52:01.940]  It's time to build your own emergency food stockpile
[52:01.940 --> 52:04.940]  with the industry leader, My Patriot Supply.
[52:04.940 --> 52:07.940]  Once you try them, you'll know why so many Americans like you
[52:07.940 --> 52:10.940]  have made them part of their emergency preparedness plan.
[52:10.940 --> 52:13.940]  Experience the My Patriot Supply difference today

[53:25.940 --> 53:29.940]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[53:29.940 --> 53:31.940]  Have you ever wondered why banks, stockbrokers,
[53:31.940 --> 53:34.940]  investment advisors won't talk about gold IRAs?
[53:34.940 --> 53:36.940]  They've been available since 1986,
[53:36.940 --> 53:38.940]  yet the financial industry won't recognize
[53:38.940 --> 53:40.940]  the value of gold for your retirement.
[53:40.940 --> 53:42.940]  Gold is outperformed paper investments,
[53:42.940 --> 53:44.940]  yet no word about IRAs.
[53:44.940 --> 53:46.940]  If you would like to have gold for your retirement,
[53:46.940 --> 53:48.940]  call 800-686-2237.
[53:48.940 --> 53:51.940]  Don't get left behind by rising inflation and low returns.
[53:51.940 --> 53:54.940]  Call 800-686-2237.
[53:54.940 --> 53:58.940]  Secure your future and call 1-800-686-2237.
[54:08.940 --> 54:11.940]  During the last few breaks,
[54:11.940 --> 54:14.940]  I was looking over the trade and services agreement
[54:14.940 --> 54:16.940]  from WikiLeaks.
[54:16.940 --> 54:20.940]  We're talking 100-plus pages
[54:20.940 --> 54:22.940]  in just one of the sections,
[54:22.940 --> 54:24.940]  and I was scanning over it.
[54:24.940 --> 54:26.940]  And it's really bad.
[54:26.940 --> 54:28.940]  And Forbes has now read it
[54:28.940 --> 54:30.940]  and is pointing out how horrible it is.
[54:30.940 --> 54:32.940]  But the larger issue is,
[54:32.940 --> 54:34.940]  this is being done in secret.
[54:34.940 --> 54:36.940]  It's multinational.
[54:36.940 --> 54:39.940]  The agenda is set by private corporations
[54:39.940 --> 54:43.940]  that are very authoritarian in every aspect.
[54:43.940 --> 54:46.940]  They're the ones finding the whole globalist agenda.
[54:46.940 --> 54:48.940]  You don't name all this bad stuff, they're behind it.
[54:48.940 --> 54:50.940]  But here's the bigger issue.
[54:50.940 --> 54:52.940]  They're giving themselves the authority,
[54:52.940 --> 54:54.940]  and this is all written
[54:54.940 --> 54:58.940]  where they may modify it anytime they want.
[54:58.940 --> 55:00.940]  So it's a tyrannical power grab.
[55:00.940 --> 55:05.940]  It's kind of like Obamacare was written so open-ended.
[55:05.940 --> 55:09.940]  And then Obama, hundreds of times, has modified it himself.
[55:09.940 --> 55:11.940]  It's this process where it's just,
[55:11.940 --> 55:15.940]  they can do whatever they want.
[55:15.940 --> 55:18.940]  And then they ignore any of the rights
[55:18.940 --> 55:20.940]  that they talk about for the people.
[55:20.940 --> 55:25.940]  Paul Watson, we're sending in
[55:25.940 --> 55:29.940]  Josh and Rob do.
[55:29.940 --> 55:31.940]  They're going out there Sunday.
[55:31.940 --> 55:34.940]  They should be in and around the area by Monday.
[55:34.940 --> 55:36.940]  I don't want to really get into when you're going,
[55:36.940 --> 55:39.940]  but I think you should go sooner rather than later.
[55:39.940 --> 55:43.940]  And because we really need to get shots inside that hotel and stuff.
[55:43.940 --> 55:45.940]  And we have one of their online magazines.
[55:45.940 --> 55:47.940]  You can see what it looks like.
[55:47.940 --> 55:49.940]  But I like to get in beforehand.
[55:49.940 --> 55:52.940]  So I'd like to tell you, you're a lot closer.
[55:52.940 --> 55:54.940]  I think you should just leave tomorrow.
[55:54.940 --> 55:56.940]  But I'll call you after the show today.
[55:56.940 --> 55:57.940]  I've gotten so busy.
[55:57.940 --> 55:59.940]  I haven't really pre-planned a lot of this with you,
[55:59.940 --> 56:00.940]  as I should have.
[56:00.940 --> 56:02.940]  But the bigger issue is we have sources,
[56:02.940 --> 56:04.940]  plus we have statements by Bilderberg members in public.
[56:04.940 --> 56:07.940]  We know what their agenda is going to be.
[56:07.940 --> 56:09.940]  I need to call you with some of the intel.
[56:09.940 --> 56:11.940]  I've gotten from one of my big sources,
[56:11.940 --> 56:14.940]  but I know you have one of those same sources.
[56:14.940 --> 56:16.940]  You're planning Monday, you think,
[56:16.940 --> 56:18.940]  is the best time to release the Bilderberg agenda.
[56:18.940 --> 56:20.940]  And then I guess Thursday,
[56:20.940 --> 56:25.940]  they'll probably release their spun version on their website, right, Paul?
[56:25.940 --> 56:28.940]  Yeah, they always release bullet points,
[56:28.940 --> 56:30.940]  which provide no substance whatsoever,
[56:30.940 --> 56:32.940]  very vague generic information,
[56:32.940 --> 56:33.940]  which could be about anything.
[56:33.940 --> 56:36.940]  So they don't really release their minutes or anything detailed.
[56:36.940 --> 56:37.940]  So they just do that to say,
[56:37.940 --> 56:40.940]  oh, look, we're being transparent when it's basically nothing.
[56:40.940 --> 56:44.940]  The key intel always comes out before or immediately after the conference.
[56:44.940 --> 56:48.940]  So that's what we'll be talking about.
[56:48.940 --> 56:51.940]  Other points so far, I mean, it's in the Austrian news,
[56:51.940 --> 56:53.940]  already some of the points we already knew.
[56:53.940 --> 56:55.940]  Open borders, making Europe bring in all these immigrants,
[56:55.940 --> 56:57.940]  getting rid of borders, making us do it,
[56:57.940 --> 57:00.940]  make us all pay for it, more social manipulation,
[57:00.940 --> 57:03.940]  getting rid of cash, doing bail ins,
[57:03.940 --> 57:07.940]  doing $100 trillion per decade global carbon tax.
[57:07.940 --> 57:09.940]  What are some of the other things we know already
[57:09.940 --> 57:10.940]  you're going to be on the agenda
[57:10.940 --> 57:13.940]  that you're going to be fleshing out on Monday?
[57:13.940 --> 57:17.940]  Well, the Agenda 21 thing is going to be big,
[57:17.940 --> 57:19.940]  despite the fact they keep getting caught
[57:19.940 --> 57:21.940]  in all these faux pas on the environment,
[57:21.940 --> 57:23.940]  you know, not just climate,
[57:23.940 --> 57:25.940]  almost every single month we have a new scandal.
[57:25.940 --> 57:29.940]  They're still pushing this 80% carbon tax reduction,
[57:29.940 --> 57:32.940]  which will basically cripple Western economies
[57:32.940 --> 57:34.940]  and turn everybody into, you know,
[57:34.940 --> 57:37.940]  surfs for central banks to an even greater extent.
[57:37.940 --> 57:40.940]  Cripple's not strong enough, it will end civilization.
[57:40.940 --> 57:42.940]  Yeah, basically.
[57:42.940 --> 57:45.940]  The French Foreign Minister, Laurent Fabius,
[57:45.940 --> 57:48.940]  came out on Monday and he is a Bilderberg member
[57:48.940 --> 57:51.940]  and said, look, this is not going to get past Congress,
[57:51.940 --> 57:54.940]  this Agenda 21, 80% carbon reduction.
[57:54.940 --> 57:56.940]  We're going to bypass Congress,
[57:56.940 --> 57:58.940]  we're going to make the Obama administration
[57:58.940 --> 58:02.940]  in concert with the UN, force this into being,
[58:02.940 --> 58:05.940]  so they're going to use outright dictatorship,
[58:05.940 --> 58:07.940]  force this eco-tyranny into existence,
[58:07.940 --> 58:09.940]  so at least going to try that.
[58:09.940 --> 58:11.940]  And that's what it's going to be about.
[58:11.940 --> 58:13.940]  They're also going to be talking about
[58:13.940 --> 58:15.940]  the Global Political Awakening,
[58:15.940 --> 58:17.940]  which is a big new Britonsky talks about,
[58:17.940 --> 58:19.940]  you know, four or five years ago now,
[58:19.940 --> 58:21.940]  because we're already seeing the consequences of that
[58:21.940 --> 58:23.940]  with these riots.
[58:23.940 --> 58:25.940]  That's why they're trying to hijack groups
[58:25.940 --> 58:27.940]  like Black Lives Matter,
[58:27.940 --> 58:29.940]  because they know that this resentment is going to build.
[58:29.940 --> 58:31.940]  Stay there, Paul. Do five more minutes with us.
[58:31.940 --> 58:33.940]  I'm going to come right back and have you get more
[58:33.940 --> 58:35.940]  into the agenda on Bilderberg,
[58:35.940 --> 58:37.940]  the folks behind the TPP and everything else,

[59:23.940 --> 59:25.940]  of Survival Shield X2 Nation Iodine
[59:25.940 --> 59:27.940]  are running low.
[59:27.940 --> 59:29.940]  But what's even more serious
[59:29.940 --> 59:31.940]  is the supply of these deep Earth crystals.
[59:31.940 --> 59:33.940]  That exclusive 999 pure source

[01:00:03.940 --> 01:00:05.940]  It was easier to control
[01:00:05.940 --> 01:00:07.940]  a million people, literally.
[01:00:07.940 --> 01:00:09.940]  It was easier to control
[01:00:09.940 --> 01:00:11.940]  a million people
[01:00:11.940 --> 01:00:13.940]  than physically to kill
[01:00:13.940 --> 01:00:15.940]  a million people.
[01:00:15.940 --> 01:00:17.940]  Today, it is infinitely
[01:00:17.940 --> 01:00:19.940]  easier to kill a million people
[01:00:19.940 --> 01:00:21.940]  than to control
[01:00:21.940 --> 01:00:47.940]  a million people.

[01:00:53.940 --> 01:00:55.940]  FEMA Region 6
[01:00:55.940 --> 01:00:57.940]  in occupied North America.
[01:00:57.940 --> 01:00:59.940]  All Watson.
[01:00:59.940 --> 01:01:01.940]  I've been ranting here.
[01:01:01.940 --> 01:01:03.940]  I just cannot get over the awakening that's happening.
[01:01:03.940 --> 01:01:05.940]  But for every action, there's an opposite and equal reaction.
[01:01:05.940 --> 01:01:07.940]  That goes both ways.
[01:01:07.940 --> 01:01:09.940]  The establishment is just
[01:01:09.940 --> 01:01:11.940]  speeding up, ramping up
[01:01:11.940 --> 01:01:13.940]  everything they're doing
[01:01:13.940 --> 01:01:15.940]  and they're just trying, I guess,
[01:01:15.940 --> 01:01:17.940]  to finish up on some more
[01:01:17.940 --> 01:01:19.940]  of the agenda that we've ferreted out
[01:01:19.940 --> 01:01:21.940]  from our sources
[01:01:21.940 --> 01:01:23.940]  and then confirmed, because we double-check
[01:01:23.940 --> 01:01:25.940]  our sources, that the very Bilderberg group
[01:01:25.940 --> 01:01:27.940]  members are actually making
[01:01:27.940 --> 01:01:29.940]  a lot of these statements in public.
[01:01:29.940 --> 01:01:33.940]  They're such nakedly totalitarian.
[01:01:33.940 --> 01:01:35.940]  Yeah, that's what they're saying about
[01:01:35.940 --> 01:01:37.940]  the agendas to ban cash,
[01:01:37.940 --> 01:01:39.940]  forcing everyone to have a
[01:01:39.940 --> 01:01:41.940]  government-controlled bank account
[01:01:41.940 --> 01:01:43.940]  because they want to keep interest rates low
[01:01:43.940 --> 01:01:45.940]  increasingly, going to pull their money out
[01:01:45.940 --> 01:01:47.940]  of the bank, so they want to force
[01:01:47.940 --> 01:01:49.940]  people to keep their money in the banks
[01:01:49.940 --> 01:01:51.940]  and then regulate it that way.
[01:01:51.940 --> 01:01:53.940]  They're also outright
[01:01:53.940 --> 01:01:55.940]  creating class warfare.
[01:01:55.940 --> 01:01:57.940]  George Soros said that
[01:01:57.940 --> 01:01:59.940]  class warfare and riots were coming
[01:01:59.940 --> 01:02:01.940]  back in 2012.
[01:02:01.940 --> 01:02:03.940]  Now he's funding Black Lives Matter,
[01:02:03.940 --> 01:02:05.940]  which is driving a lot of that
[01:02:05.940 --> 01:02:07.940]  because it's been hijacked and steered
[01:02:07.940 --> 01:02:09.940]  towards racial division.
[01:02:09.940 --> 01:02:11.940]  Since last year
[01:02:11.940 --> 01:02:13.940]  they've been paying to the tune of $33 million.
[01:02:13.940 --> 01:02:15.940]  Meanwhile,
[01:02:15.940 --> 01:02:17.940]  the elite are buying all these
[01:02:17.940 --> 01:02:19.940]  safe rooms, they're buying remote property
[01:02:19.940 --> 01:02:21.940]  in New Zealand. They're saying
[01:02:21.940 --> 01:02:23.940]  because of things like Ferguson, they're concerned
[01:02:23.940 --> 01:02:25.940]  about societal breakdown
[01:02:25.940 --> 01:02:27.940]  and disorder, while
[01:02:27.940 --> 01:02:29.940]  themselves creating it
[01:02:29.940 --> 01:02:31.940]  with the proven method
[01:02:31.940 --> 01:02:33.940]  of wealth inequality
[01:02:33.940 --> 01:02:35.940]  and this drop in real wages
[01:02:35.940 --> 01:02:37.940]  as the worldwide inflation spikes
[01:02:37.940 --> 01:02:39.940]  through endless money printing.
[01:02:39.940 --> 01:02:41.940]  Those factors always create
[01:02:41.940 --> 01:02:43.940]  class warfare, riots
[01:02:43.940 --> 01:02:45.940]  and domestic civil unrest,
[01:02:45.940 --> 01:02:47.940]  so they're mixing
[01:02:47.940 --> 01:02:49.940]  the ingredients to a T and they know
[01:02:49.940 --> 01:02:51.940]  what the final product's going to be.
[01:02:51.940 --> 01:02:53.940]  They're bailing out, they're getting their safe
[01:02:53.940 --> 01:02:55.940]  rooms and their remote property, while
[01:02:55.940 --> 01:02:57.940]  the middle class are going to be squeezed
[01:02:57.940 --> 01:02:59.940]  in the middle, it's the whole pressure from above,
[01:02:59.940 --> 01:03:01.940]  pressure from below concept,
[01:03:01.940 --> 01:03:03.940]  so I'm sure that will be covered
[01:03:03.940 --> 01:03:05.940]  at Bilderberg this year,
[01:03:05.940 --> 01:03:07.940]  that whole class warfare, wealth
[01:03:07.940 --> 01:03:09.940]  inequality
[01:03:09.940 --> 01:03:11.940]  powder keg that's set to explode
[01:03:11.940 --> 01:03:13.940]  and already has to a great extent with
[01:03:13.940 --> 01:03:15.940]  Ferguson and Baltimore.
[01:03:15.940 --> 01:03:17.940]  Let me shift gears and another subject
[01:03:17.940 --> 01:03:19.940]  and get your take on it. I went back
[01:03:19.940 --> 01:03:21.940]  and looked, WikiLeaks claimed that they had
[01:03:21.940 --> 01:03:23.940]  the whole TPP, but only released
[01:03:23.940 --> 01:03:25.940]  the internet section, then they were saying
[01:03:25.940 --> 01:03:27.940]  oh, we don't have it, then I made
[01:03:27.940 --> 01:03:29.940]  a big deal about it on Sunday and money, I'm not
[01:03:29.940 --> 01:03:31.940]  saying that we caused it, but we
[01:03:31.940 --> 01:03:33.940]  might have put pressure on them, I'm sure other people were too.
[01:03:33.940 --> 01:03:35.940]  So now they've released another
[01:03:35.940 --> 01:03:37.940]  section saying, oh, we had a fundraiser
[01:03:37.940 --> 01:03:39.940]  a bounty for it,
[01:03:39.940 --> 01:03:41.940]  but I guess it's a bounty to get them to release it.
[01:03:41.940 --> 01:03:43.940]  You've researched this,
[01:03:43.940 --> 01:03:45.940]  what's really going on there?
[01:03:45.940 --> 01:03:47.940]  Well, I think
[01:03:47.940 --> 01:03:49.940]  a lot of the conservative
[01:03:49.940 --> 01:03:51.940]  support for it, which you've seen in Congress
[01:03:51.940 --> 01:03:53.940]  is because of the false belief
[01:03:53.940 --> 01:03:55.940]  that this will somehow
[01:03:55.940 --> 01:03:57.940]  allow smaller businesses
[01:03:57.940 --> 01:03:59.940]  in America to sue the government
[01:03:59.940 --> 01:04:01.940]  if the government imposes some kind of
[01:04:01.940 --> 01:04:03.940]  BS environmental
[01:04:03.940 --> 01:04:05.940]  regulation that puts them out of business,
[01:04:05.940 --> 01:04:07.940]  when if you read into it,
[01:04:07.940 --> 01:04:09.940]  it doesn't allow that at all, it's all about
[01:04:09.940 --> 01:04:11.940]  this corporate fascism,
[01:04:11.940 --> 01:04:13.940]  this revolving door between
[01:04:13.940 --> 01:04:15.940]  the huge mega corporations and government
[01:04:15.940 --> 01:04:17.940]  allowing them
[01:04:17.940 --> 01:04:19.940]  to impinge on sovereignty, it's got
[01:04:19.940 --> 01:04:21.940]  nothing to do with the small businesses in America,
[01:04:21.940 --> 01:04:23.940]  so that's why it's got a lot
[01:04:23.940 --> 01:04:25.940]  of misguided conservative support.
[01:04:27.940 --> 01:04:29.940]  Paul Joseph Watson is our guest,
[01:04:29.940 --> 01:04:31.940]  I need to call you right after the show today
[01:04:31.940 --> 01:04:33.940]  at two o'clock central for some
[01:04:33.940 --> 01:04:35.940]  planning sessions, because
[01:04:35.940 --> 01:04:37.940]  Bilderberg is upon us yet again, and I've got to
[01:04:39.940 --> 01:04:41.940]  figure out how to get you some information,
[01:04:41.940 --> 01:04:43.940]  because I know you're being watched that I don't want them to have
[01:04:45.940 --> 01:04:47.940]  for your security,
[01:04:47.940 --> 01:04:49.940]  so I'll be calling you today
[01:04:49.940 --> 01:04:51.940]  at about two central, okay?
[01:04:51.940 --> 01:04:53.940]  Okay. Paul Watson
[01:04:53.940 --> 01:04:55.940]  from infowars.com
[01:04:55.940 --> 01:04:57.940]  and prisonplanet.com are
[01:04:57.940 --> 01:04:59.940]  European correspondent.
[01:04:59.940 --> 01:05:01.940]  Just passed by Congress,
[01:05:01.940 --> 01:05:03.940]  the USA Freedom Act.
[01:05:03.940 --> 01:05:05.940]  Well, not real freedom,
[01:05:05.940 --> 01:05:07.940]  but the kind of freedom we act like we have
[01:05:07.940 --> 01:05:09.940]  in the USA.
[01:05:09.940 --> 01:05:11.940]  Think of it as SISPA for phone companies,
[01:05:11.940 --> 01:05:13.940]  a kind of cozy symbiotic relationship
[01:05:13.940 --> 01:05:15.940]  between the corporate oligarchy
[01:05:15.940 --> 01:05:17.940]  and the authoritarian government.
[01:05:17.940 --> 01:05:19.940]  The phone companies
[01:05:19.940 --> 01:05:21.940]  will now store your info and pass it on
[01:05:21.940 --> 01:05:23.940]  to the paranoid government on demand.
[01:05:23.940 --> 01:05:25.940]  And the phone companies will be granted
[01:05:25.940 --> 01:05:27.940]  freedom from liability, now
[01:05:27.940 --> 01:05:29.940]  that's real freedom, the kind
[01:05:29.940 --> 01:05:31.940]  only the big guys get.
[01:05:31.940 --> 01:05:33.940]  But wait, there's more.
[01:05:33.940 --> 01:05:35.940]  Now Congress will be notified whenever the secret
[01:05:35.940 --> 01:05:37.940]  finds a court, well it's not really
[01:05:37.940 --> 01:05:39.940]  a court, just a single judge,
[01:05:39.940 --> 01:05:41.940]  reinterpets the law.
[01:05:41.940 --> 01:05:43.940]  That's great,
[01:05:43.940 --> 01:05:45.940]  because they've been changing the law
[01:05:45.940 --> 01:05:47.940]  and not even telling us.
[01:05:47.940 --> 01:05:49.940]  Now they're going to let us know,
[01:05:49.940 --> 01:05:51.940]  isn't America great?
[01:05:51.940 --> 01:05:53.940]  The USA Freedom Act.
[01:05:53.940 --> 01:05:55.940]  Offer void, we're prohibited by law.
[01:05:55.940 --> 01:05:57.940]  For infowars.com, I'm David Knight.
[01:06:25.940 --> 01:06:27.940]  For infowars.com or call

[01:06:58.940 --> 01:07:00.940]  Another major health threat,
[01:07:00.940 --> 01:07:02.940]  this one in Toledo, Ohio
[01:07:02.940 --> 01:07:04.940]  where everybody in the entire city
[01:07:04.940 --> 01:07:06.940]  has been told not to drink the water.
[01:07:06.940 --> 01:07:08.940]  Ohio's governor declaring a state of emergency.
[01:07:08.940 --> 01:07:10.940]  Did you know that the average person
[01:07:10.940 --> 01:07:12.940]  uses about 80 to 100 gallons
[01:07:12.940 --> 01:07:14.940]  of water at home every single day?
[01:07:14.940 --> 01:07:16.940]  If there's a water emergency,
[01:07:16.940 --> 01:07:18.940]  will you be prepared?
[01:07:18.940 --> 01:07:20.940]  Panicked residents forming long lines
[01:07:20.940 --> 01:07:22.940]  throughout the day.
[01:07:22.940 --> 01:07:24.940]  We're here at a supermarket in Toledo,
[01:07:24.940 --> 01:07:26.940]  you can see the shelves empty
[01:07:26.940 --> 01:07:28.940]  safe and healthy during a crisis.
[01:07:28.940 --> 01:07:31.940]  You must have access to safe, clean water.
[01:07:31.940 --> 01:07:33.940]  Water which will not be available
[01:07:33.940 --> 01:07:35.940]  at your local grocery store.
[01:07:35.940 --> 01:07:37.940]  There's a mad dash on right now
[01:07:37.940 --> 01:07:38.940]  to stock up on supplies.
[01:07:38.940 --> 01:07:40.940]  The Pro Pure Pro One G2.0

[01:08:26.940 --> 01:08:28.940]  I guess treaties you could call it
[01:08:28.940 --> 01:08:31.940]  outside of Congress's authority.
[01:08:33.940 --> 01:08:35.940]  And it's also being reported
[01:08:35.940 --> 01:08:37.940]  that under the new provisions
[01:08:37.940 --> 01:08:39.940]  of the TPP that's been leaked
[01:08:39.940 --> 01:08:41.940]  by WikiLeaks,
[01:08:44.940 --> 01:08:46.940]  the deal stops countries from saying
[01:08:46.940 --> 01:08:48.940]  where your data goes
[01:08:48.940 --> 01:08:50.940]  and lets them to share all your personal data
[01:08:50.940 --> 01:08:53.940]  and also spy on internet users.
[01:08:53.940 --> 01:08:55.940]  So it's basically legalizing
[01:08:55.940 --> 01:08:58.940]  global NSA type garbage.
[01:09:00.940 --> 01:09:03.940]  Simply amazing, unprecedented.
[01:09:10.940 --> 01:09:12.940]  Continuing,
[01:09:12.940 --> 01:09:14.940]  kids abused,
[01:09:14.940 --> 01:09:16.940]  choked and beaten in dark rooms
[01:09:16.940 --> 01:09:19.940]  at police leadership camp.
[01:09:20.940 --> 01:09:22.940]  So they're teaching brutality
[01:09:22.940 --> 01:09:24.940]  and torture. They call it
[01:09:24.940 --> 01:09:26.940]  pain compliance.
[01:09:26.940 --> 01:09:28.940]  Off-grid kids still in state custody
[01:09:28.940 --> 01:09:30.940]  one month later,
[01:09:30.940 --> 01:09:32.940]  even though in court the family
[01:09:32.940 --> 01:09:34.940]  was exonerated and they said
[01:09:34.940 --> 01:09:36.940]  give them their kids back.
[01:09:37.940 --> 01:09:39.940]  Well, yeah, Obama ignores
[01:09:39.940 --> 01:09:41.940]  court rulings on NSA spying
[01:09:41.940 --> 01:09:43.940]  that's illegal.
[01:09:43.940 --> 01:09:45.940]  Or when courts say you can't have
[01:09:45.940 --> 01:09:47.940]  open borders.
[01:09:47.940 --> 01:09:49.940]  I don't want to cover this later.
[01:09:49.940 --> 01:09:51.940]  Slacktivist Susan Sarandon
[01:09:51.940 --> 01:09:54.940]  is too lazy to wear an anti-gun T-shirt.
[01:09:54.940 --> 01:09:56.940]  That's what this wear orange day
[01:09:56.940 --> 01:09:58.940]  that Google and others have been promoting is about.
[01:09:58.940 --> 01:10:00.940]  Where you wear orange for gun victims
[01:10:00.940 --> 01:10:02.940]  as if guns.
[01:10:02.940 --> 01:10:04.940]  How about you wear pink for people
[01:10:04.940 --> 01:10:06.940]  run over by cars and we blame cars?
[01:10:06.940 --> 01:10:08.940]  How about people driving cars?
[01:10:09.940 --> 01:10:12.940]  But that ties in to other Hollywood folks
[01:10:12.940 --> 01:10:14.940]  showing that they're starting to wake up.
[01:10:14.940 --> 01:10:16.940]  John Kuzak says that
[01:10:16.940 --> 01:10:18.940]  Obama is far worse
[01:10:18.940 --> 01:10:21.940]  than Obama close quote.
[01:10:22.940 --> 01:10:24.940]  Liberal professor
[01:10:24.940 --> 01:10:26.940]  vilified as racist
[01:10:26.940 --> 01:10:28.940]  for accurately outing activist
[01:10:28.940 --> 01:10:30.940]  for actively quoting activist.
[01:10:30.940 --> 01:10:32.940]  I'm a liberal professor
[01:10:32.940 --> 01:10:34.940]  and my liberal students terrify me.
[01:10:36.940 --> 01:10:38.940]  It's an article I'm going to break down later.
[01:10:38.940 --> 01:10:40.940]  I just so happen to run into
[01:10:40.940 --> 01:10:42.940]  a mainstream Chinese newspaper
[01:10:42.940 --> 01:10:44.940]  in English article.
[01:10:44.940 --> 01:10:46.940]  But I think I aimed it
[01:10:46.940 --> 01:10:48.940]  to Nico
[01:10:48.940 --> 01:10:50.940]  or maybe I forgot, I don't remember.
[01:10:50.940 --> 01:10:52.940]  And it was a high-level Communist Party official
[01:10:52.940 --> 01:10:54.940]  apologizing
[01:10:54.940 --> 01:10:56.940]  and being praised by the Communist Party of China
[01:10:58.940 --> 01:11:00.940]  for renouncing
[01:11:00.940 --> 01:11:02.940]  Communists during the Cultural Revolution
[01:11:02.940 --> 01:11:04.940]  like her school principal
[01:11:04.940 --> 01:11:06.940]  and killing him with a group of Red Guard.
[01:11:08.940 --> 01:11:10.940]  And Red Guard in Communist
[01:11:10.940 --> 01:11:12.940]  systems, North Korea, Communist China, you name it,
[01:11:12.940 --> 01:11:14.940]  are youth brigades of high school
[01:11:14.940 --> 01:11:16.940]  and college people
[01:11:16.940 --> 01:11:18.940]  that go out and just viciously murder people.
[01:11:18.940 --> 01:11:20.940]  And so
[01:11:20.940 --> 01:11:22.940]  that's why psychos around the U.S.
[01:11:22.940 --> 01:11:24.940]  and the world said they're part of the Red Guard
[01:11:24.940 --> 01:11:26.940]  and it's a fantasy of young people rising up
[01:11:26.940 --> 01:11:28.940]  and killing old people
[01:11:28.940 --> 01:11:30.940]  or killing anybody they want basically.
[01:11:32.940 --> 01:11:34.940]  And it's just so sick that you'd have people
[01:11:34.940 --> 01:11:36.940]  praising the Red Guard in the United States
[01:11:36.940 --> 01:11:38.940]  and the Red Guard
[01:11:38.940 --> 01:11:40.940]  coming after us, pathetically.
[01:11:40.940 --> 01:11:44.940]  They could hardly walk.
[01:11:44.940 --> 01:11:46.940]  But
[01:11:46.940 --> 01:11:48.940]  the Red Guard
[01:11:50.940 --> 01:11:52.940]  has been denounced in China
[01:11:52.940 --> 01:11:54.940]  and Mao Zedong has been denounced in China
[01:11:54.940 --> 01:11:56.940]  and the Communist Party admits
[01:11:56.940 --> 01:11:58.940]  he killed 84 million people.
[01:11:58.940 --> 01:12:00.940]  But only in warped England
[01:12:00.940 --> 01:12:02.940]  or the United States would you have
[01:12:02.940 --> 01:12:04.940]  at every major college, Red Guard groups
[01:12:04.940 --> 01:12:06.940]  running around actually wearing
[01:12:06.940 --> 01:12:08.940]  Mao shirts.
[01:12:08.940 --> 01:12:10.940]  I mean, if you go to Nordstroms
[01:12:10.940 --> 01:12:12.940]  or you go to, you know, trendy restaurants
[01:12:12.940 --> 01:12:14.940]  they'll have plates with Mao on it
[01:12:14.940 --> 01:12:16.940]  for rich people to come eat on.
[01:12:16.940 --> 01:12:18.940]  It's just flirting with total death,
[01:12:18.940 --> 01:12:20.940]  flirting with disaster
[01:12:20.940 --> 01:12:22.940]  only in a rich, decadent, wealthy nation
[01:12:22.940 --> 01:12:24.940]  could yuppies children
[01:12:26.940 --> 01:12:28.940]  run around fantasizing
[01:12:28.940 --> 01:12:30.940]  about how they're going to run around
[01:12:30.940 --> 01:12:32.940]  killing a bunch of people.
[01:12:32.940 --> 01:12:34.940]  That's not going to work
[01:12:34.940 --> 01:12:36.940]  in the same way here in the United States.
[01:12:36.940 --> 01:12:38.940]  We're not
[01:12:38.940 --> 01:12:40.940]  poor disarmed Chinese peasants that
[01:12:40.940 --> 01:12:42.940]  can be
[01:12:42.940 --> 01:12:44.940]  fed on by a pack of
[01:12:44.940 --> 01:12:46.940]  middle class
[01:12:46.940 --> 01:12:48.940]  and upper middle class kids.
[01:12:48.940 --> 01:12:50.940]  Because that's who the Red Guard was in China
[01:12:50.940 --> 01:12:52.940]  was just the spoiled, rotten Communist Party kids
[01:12:52.940 --> 01:12:54.940]  who now
[01:12:54.940 --> 01:12:56.940]  are billionaires and, you know, rule.
[01:12:56.940 --> 01:12:58.940]  It's totally sick.
[01:12:58.940 --> 01:13:00.940]  But at the end of the day, that's what it is
[01:13:00.940 --> 01:13:02.940]  is it's a fantasy
[01:13:02.940 --> 01:13:04.940]  of seizing power by nothings.
[01:13:04.940 --> 01:13:06.940]  Who
[01:13:06.940 --> 01:13:08.940]  come from nothing and who will never be anything.
[01:13:10.940 --> 01:13:12.940]  I wanted to get Dr. Group
[01:13:12.940 --> 01:13:14.940]  on about this article
[01:13:14.940 --> 01:13:16.940]  that people also like me was on two weeks ago
[01:13:16.940 --> 01:13:18.940]  and we had the Ask Dr. Group
[01:13:18.940 --> 01:13:20.940]  a question
[01:13:20.940 --> 01:13:22.940]  on supplements, on cleaning up your body
[01:13:22.940 --> 01:13:24.940]  on
[01:13:24.940 --> 01:13:26.940]  detoxing, something that he harps on a lot
[01:13:26.940 --> 01:13:28.940]  tell of the Daily Mail today
[01:13:28.940 --> 01:13:30.940]  exposure to common household pesticides
[01:13:30.940 --> 01:13:32.940]  triples boys
[01:13:32.940 --> 01:13:34.940]  risk of ADHD.
[01:13:34.940 --> 01:13:36.940]  Really, you mean bug poison might not be good for you?
[01:13:36.940 --> 01:13:38.940]  Experts warn
[01:13:38.940 --> 01:13:40.940]  a pesticide found in common household products
[01:13:40.940 --> 01:13:42.940]  has been found at triple boys risk of being
[01:13:42.940 --> 01:13:44.940]  diagnosed with attention deficit
[01:13:44.940 --> 01:13:46.940]  high productivity disorder. Yeah, Roach
[01:13:46.940 --> 01:13:48.940]  has run around at first when he's preying with poison too.
[01:13:48.940 --> 01:13:50.940]  Scientists have warned
[01:13:50.940 --> 01:13:52.940]  symptoms of the condition, notably high productivity
[01:13:52.940 --> 01:13:54.940]  and impulsive activity
[01:13:54.940 --> 01:13:56.940]  have found to be associated with exposure
[01:13:56.940 --> 01:13:58.940]  to
[01:13:58.940 --> 01:14:00.940]  pyrethroid pesticides
[01:14:00.940 --> 01:14:02.940]  which is one of the most common ones
[01:14:02.940 --> 01:14:04.940]  that comes from a flower
[01:14:04.940 --> 01:14:06.940]  in South Africa that they claim is pretty safe.
[01:14:08.940 --> 01:14:10.940]  Chrysanthemum, yeah.
[01:14:10.940 --> 01:14:12.940]  Look, I'm not stupid, but my dad would tell me
[01:14:12.940 --> 01:14:14.940]  when I was, you know, 10, 11, 12 years old
[01:14:14.940 --> 01:14:16.940]  or even younger, take the dogs out
[01:14:16.940 --> 01:14:18.940]  and give them a bath. They got fleas.
[01:14:18.940 --> 01:14:20.940]  And I remember I'd wash them with pyrethrin
[01:14:22.940 --> 01:14:24.940]  soap
[01:14:24.940 --> 01:14:26.940]  and I remember getting higher than a kite.
[01:14:26.940 --> 01:14:28.940]  But my dad was a smart guy
[01:14:28.940 --> 01:14:30.940]  but he kind of went with the system
[01:14:30.940 --> 01:14:32.940]  that pyrethrins are safe for humans.
[01:14:32.940 --> 01:14:34.940]  No, I should have been wearing gloves
[01:14:34.940 --> 01:14:36.940]  and I'd get it all over me
[01:14:36.940 --> 01:14:38.940]  and I'd be back there, you know, on the
[01:14:38.940 --> 01:14:40.940]  porch or the front yard
[01:14:40.940 --> 01:14:42.940]  out there with the water hose, washing the
[01:14:42.940 --> 01:14:44.940]  dogs, scrubbing them, everything.
[01:14:44.940 --> 01:14:46.940]  That was one of my chores, mowing the lawn,
[01:14:46.940 --> 01:14:48.940]  carrying out the trash, helping him do, clean
[01:14:48.940 --> 01:14:50.940]  out the gutters.
[01:14:50.940 --> 01:14:52.940]  Now kids just watch television and dream of
[01:14:52.940 --> 01:14:54.940]  being on the Red Guards, but
[01:14:54.940 --> 01:14:56.940]  I can't wait for
[01:14:56.940 --> 01:14:58.940]  Red Terror to be carried out on Jones.
[01:14:58.940 --> 01:15:00.940]  Yeah, man.
[01:15:00.940 --> 01:15:02.940]  Can't wait to kill him.
[01:15:08.940 --> 01:15:10.940]  That might be easier than you think,
[01:15:10.940 --> 01:15:12.940]  actually.
[01:15:12.940 --> 01:15:14.940]  Then you're going to get locked up
[01:15:14.940 --> 01:15:16.940]  in a supermax prison.
[01:15:16.940 --> 01:15:18.940]  But
[01:15:18.940 --> 01:15:20.940]  continuing here, ladies
[01:15:20.940 --> 01:15:22.940]  and gentlemen,
[01:15:22.940 --> 01:15:24.940]  this is what we're talking about.
[01:15:24.940 --> 01:15:26.940]  And you add thousands of chemicals
[01:15:26.940 --> 01:15:28.940]  and the stuff that's in the clothes and everything,
[01:15:28.940 --> 01:15:30.940]  that's why we got a
[01:15:30.940 --> 01:15:32.940]  whacked out society.
[01:15:32.940 --> 01:15:34.940]  The leader whacked out because they're in
[01:15:34.940 --> 01:15:36.940]  bread, decking it out of their minds.
[01:15:36.940 --> 01:15:38.940]  History shows that happens over and over again.
[01:15:38.940 --> 01:15:40.940]  So Dr. Group, infowarslife.com's
[01:15:40.940 --> 01:15:42.940]  main advisor and quality control
[01:15:42.940 --> 01:15:44.940]  officer, army special ops
[01:15:44.940 --> 01:15:46.940]  veteran, he's got a whole bunch
[01:15:46.940 --> 01:15:48.940]  of nutritionist degrees,
[01:15:48.940 --> 01:15:50.940]  alternative medicine degrees,
[01:15:50.940 --> 01:15:52.940]  chiropractor as well. I won't go over his amazing
[01:15:52.940 --> 01:15:54.940]  background, but he's really a smart
[01:15:54.940 --> 01:15:56.940]  guy. We have medical doctors that advises as well
[01:15:56.940 --> 01:15:58.940]  and my dad's a chemist and other things he advises
[01:15:58.940 --> 01:16:00.940]  infowarslife.com.
[01:16:00.940 --> 01:16:02.940]  He's pioneered a lot of
[01:16:02.940 --> 01:16:04.940]  the research that's cutting edge
[01:16:04.940 --> 01:16:06.940]  out there today and of course
[01:16:06.940 --> 01:16:08.940]  it's mirrored by a lot of the research of Dr.
[01:16:08.940 --> 01:16:10.940]  Blalock, who's of course a retired brain surgeon.
[01:16:10.940 --> 01:16:12.940]  But here we are
[01:16:12.940 --> 01:16:14.940]  going over all this today.
[01:16:14.940 --> 01:16:16.940]  Dr. Group, what should we hit first?
[01:16:16.940 --> 01:16:18.940]  I know you've got an agenda stuff you want to cover and take calls
[01:16:18.940 --> 01:16:20.940]  at the bottom of the hour, but
[01:16:20.940 --> 01:16:22.940]  when every time you come in you harp on what's
[01:16:22.940 --> 01:16:24.940]  under the kitchen cabinet
[01:16:24.940 --> 01:16:26.940]  or what these
[01:16:26.940 --> 01:16:28.940]  flower extracts are doing
[01:16:28.940 --> 01:16:30.940]  what is your overall
[01:16:30.940 --> 01:16:32.940]  view on this situation?
[01:16:32.940 --> 01:16:34.940]  Well, I've been saying for a long
[01:16:34.940 --> 01:16:36.940]  time, you know, addressing the root cause
[01:16:36.940 --> 01:16:38.940]  of disease is one thing
[01:16:38.940 --> 01:16:40.940]  and really when you look at
[01:16:40.940 --> 01:16:42.940]  the pharmaceutical companies
[01:16:42.940 --> 01:16:44.940]  there's two branches. One branch
[01:16:44.940 --> 01:16:46.940]  is disease management and the
[01:16:46.940 --> 01:16:48.940]  other branch is mental illness
[01:16:48.940 --> 01:16:50.940]  creation and management
[01:16:50.940 --> 01:16:52.940]  and all of the men, whether it's
[01:16:52.940 --> 01:16:54.940]  ADD, ADHD, depression, anxiety,
[01:16:54.940 --> 01:16:56.940]  bipolar, schizophrenia
[01:16:56.940 --> 01:16:58.940]  all of that's caused by
[01:16:58.940 --> 01:17:00.940]  too many chemicals coming in
[01:17:00.940 --> 01:17:02.940]  and not enough coming out.
[01:17:02.940 --> 01:17:04.940]  And folks do that, they used to say mad as a hatter
[01:17:04.940 --> 01:17:06.940]  for folks that worked around mercury.
[01:17:06.940 --> 01:17:08.940]  Right, right.
[01:17:08.940 --> 01:17:10.940]  So again, you know, it's the medical profession
[01:17:10.940 --> 01:17:12.940]  and the pharmaceutical companies
[01:17:12.940 --> 01:17:14.940]  creating illnesses and creating conditions
[01:17:14.940 --> 01:17:16.940]  and they're saying it's
[01:17:16.940 --> 01:17:18.940]  a chemical imbalance in the brain
[01:17:18.940 --> 01:17:20.940]  but it's really chemical toxicity
[01:17:20.940 --> 01:17:22.940]  in the brain. That's why
[01:17:22.940 --> 01:17:24.940]  3,000 people a month die from
[01:17:24.940 --> 01:17:26.940]  psychiatric medications and that's
[01:17:26.940 --> 01:17:28.940]  why our children are being medicated
[01:17:28.940 --> 01:17:30.940]  now because it's an easy way
[01:17:30.940 --> 01:17:32.940]  to put people on medications
[01:17:32.940 --> 01:17:34.940]  for the rest of their life. They're even trying
[01:17:34.940 --> 01:17:36.940]  to diagnose
[01:17:36.940 --> 01:17:38.940]  children in the womb with
[01:17:38.940 --> 01:17:40.940]  bipolar disease right now. They want
[01:17:40.940 --> 01:17:42.940]  every single person from the age of one
[01:17:42.940 --> 01:17:44.940]  on some medication
[01:17:44.940 --> 01:17:46.940]  for life. There's 4 year olds
[01:17:46.940 --> 01:17:48.940]  that have attempted suicide. There's 5
[01:17:48.940 --> 01:17:50.940]  year olds that have actually committed
[01:17:50.940 --> 01:17:52.940]  suicide because of the
[01:17:52.940 --> 01:17:54.940]  anti-psychology. But that's okay because the federal
[01:17:54.940 --> 01:17:56.940]  initiative that's 10 years old
[01:17:56.940 --> 01:17:58.940]  is called the New Freedom Initiative
[01:17:58.940 --> 01:18:00.940]  which admits its goal is to basically drug everybody.
[01:18:00.940 --> 01:18:02.940]  Its interim goal is
[01:18:02.940 --> 01:18:04.940]  by 2015, I guess that's this year
[01:18:04.940 --> 01:18:06.940]  to have half the kids in the country
[01:18:06.940 --> 01:18:08.940]  on a psychiatric drug. They haven't reached
[01:18:08.940 --> 01:18:10.940]  that yet but they're working towards it.
[01:18:10.940 --> 01:18:12.940]  And if you leave
[01:18:12.940 --> 01:18:14.940]  a psychiatrist's office
[01:18:14.940 --> 01:18:16.940]  without a prescription, there's even a mental
[01:18:16.940 --> 01:18:18.940]  disorder for that
[01:18:18.940 --> 01:18:20.940]  where they can put on your record that you left
[01:18:20.940 --> 01:18:22.940]  without a prescription and you
[01:18:22.940 --> 01:18:24.940]  have mental illness because you left.
[01:18:24.940 --> 01:18:26.940]  So yes, it's
[01:18:26.940 --> 01:18:28.940]  the labeling of the new society.
[01:18:28.940 --> 01:18:30.940]  So in the future, they can take
[01:18:30.940 --> 01:18:32.940]  your rights away from you because you're mentally
[01:18:32.940 --> 01:18:34.940]  unstable and you have some form
[01:18:34.940 --> 01:18:36.940]  of mental disorder. Whether it's
[01:18:36.940 --> 01:18:38.940]  ADD, ADHD, whether it's a phobia
[01:18:38.940 --> 01:18:40.940]  biting your fingernails, eating organic
[01:18:40.940 --> 01:18:42.940]  food, it doesn't matter.
[01:18:42.940 --> 01:18:44.940]  Not trusting that government.
[01:18:44.940 --> 01:18:46.940]  I mean, they're creating scores
[01:18:46.940 --> 01:18:48.940]  of mental illnesses every year.
[01:18:48.940 --> 01:18:50.940]  Right. Well, the DSM-5 now
[01:18:50.940 --> 01:18:52.940]  has over 400 mental illnesses
[01:18:52.940 --> 01:18:54.940]  in it and it's just getting
[01:18:54.940 --> 01:18:56.940]  worse and worse and worse and not only that
[01:18:56.940 --> 01:18:58.940]  but these psychiatric medications, most of
[01:18:58.940 --> 01:19:00.940]  them contain fluoride which calcifies
[01:19:00.940 --> 01:19:02.940]  the pineal gland, demotivates you.
[01:19:02.940 --> 01:19:04.940]  We're really
[01:19:04.940 --> 01:19:06.940]  what's happening is turning people into
[01:19:06.940 --> 01:19:08.940]  zombies and we're not
[01:19:08.940 --> 01:19:10.940]  creating geniuses
[01:19:10.940 --> 01:19:12.940]  again like we used to.
[01:19:12.940 --> 01:19:14.940]  Most of the world's best
[01:19:14.940 --> 01:19:16.940]  geniuses, Einstein,
[01:19:16.940 --> 01:19:18.940]  Sir Isaac Newton, all of those
[01:19:18.940 --> 01:19:20.940]  individuals would have been labeled with
[01:19:20.940 --> 01:19:22.940]  learning disabilities and put on some sort
[01:19:22.940 --> 01:19:24.940]  of medication. So it's the dumbing down
[01:19:24.940 --> 01:19:26.940]  with the inclusion of the vaccinations
[01:19:26.940 --> 01:19:28.940]  and all the other chemicals and toxins
[01:19:28.940 --> 01:19:30.940]  like what you were talking about earlier
[01:19:30.940 --> 01:19:32.940]  in the home and in the environment,
[01:19:32.940 --> 01:19:34.940]  in the schools, in the workplace
[01:19:34.940 --> 01:19:36.940]  that people and children
[01:19:36.940 --> 01:19:38.940]  are being exposed to and the children are
[01:19:38.940 --> 01:19:40.940]  just a lot more sensitive to it than
[01:19:40.940 --> 01:19:42.940]  the adults.
[01:19:42.940 --> 01:19:44.940]  Well, I remember when I would use pyrethrin-based
[01:19:44.940 --> 01:19:46.940]  stuff, I would get
[01:19:46.940 --> 01:19:48.940]  hyper, I would get sped up from it.
[01:19:48.940 --> 01:19:50.940]  I mean, I just remember feeling weird
[01:19:50.940 --> 01:19:52.940]  after I would wash the dogs
[01:19:52.940 --> 01:19:54.940]  and then now here it is, just admitted
[01:19:54.940 --> 01:19:56.940]  and they said it was totally safe for humans
[01:19:56.940 --> 01:20:06.940]  to be around, but of course we know that's not true.
[01:20:26.940 --> 01:20:28.940]  When the day comes where the world changes forever,
[01:20:28.940 --> 01:20:30.940]  you can be ready at a moment's notice.

[01:21:58.940 --> 01:22:00.940]  As if chlorine in our water
[01:22:00.940 --> 01:22:02.940]  weren't bad enough, now they're adding ammonia?
[01:22:02.940 --> 01:22:04.940]  It's true. Some municipalities
[01:22:04.940 --> 01:22:06.940]  are now adding ammonia plus chlorine
[01:22:06.940 --> 01:22:08.940]  to your water supply.
[01:22:08.940 --> 01:22:10.940]  It's a disinfectant called chloramine.
[01:22:10.940 --> 01:22:12.940]  But with a trusted big Berkey water filter,
[01:22:12.940 --> 01:22:14.940]  you can keep chloramine out of your water.

[01:22:58.940 --> 01:23:00.940]  It's very easy to be a criminal.
[01:23:00.940 --> 01:23:02.940]  All you need to burglarize a home
[01:23:02.940 --> 01:23:04.940]  is one simple household tool.
[01:23:04.940 --> 01:23:06.940]  A pair of scissors.
[01:23:06.940 --> 01:23:08.940]  If your home security system can be
[01:23:08.940 --> 01:23:10.940]  compromised by a criminal using scissors,
[01:23:10.940 --> 01:23:12.940]  then you're making it easy for them.
[01:23:12.940 --> 01:23:14.940]  Almost every home security system,
[01:23:14.940 --> 01:23:16.940]  name companies, has a weakness.
[01:23:16.940 --> 01:23:18.940]  The phone line. You shell out $1,500.
[01:23:18.940 --> 01:23:20.940]  Get locked into a long-term contract
[01:23:20.940 --> 01:23:22.940]  and think you're safe.
[01:23:22.940 --> 01:23:24.940]  But a burglar can destroy your alarm
[01:23:24.940 --> 01:23:26.940]  in seconds with one snip.
[01:23:26.940 --> 01:23:28.940]  And when a burglar cuts your phone line,
[01:23:28.940 --> 01:23:30.940]  you're defenseless.

[01:24:12.940 --> 01:24:14.940]  I also want to get into a biz-pack review
[01:24:14.940 --> 01:24:16.940]  where the former psychiatric head
[01:24:16.940 --> 01:24:18.940]  of John Hopkins has come out
[01:24:18.940 --> 01:24:20.940]  and said that this whole move
[01:24:20.940 --> 01:24:22.940]  for men to be women and women to be men
[01:24:22.940 --> 01:24:24.940]  is a psychiatric illness.
[01:24:24.940 --> 01:24:26.940]  We call it
[01:24:26.940 --> 01:24:28.940]  disabling yourself
[01:24:28.940 --> 01:24:30.940]  a new right
[01:24:30.940 --> 01:24:32.940]  to chop your arms and legs off.
[01:24:32.940 --> 01:24:34.940]  And they have a term for that.
[01:24:34.940 --> 01:24:36.940]  We're going to talk about that coming up in a moment.
[01:24:36.940 --> 01:24:38.940]  But how much of it is chemical manipulation?
[01:24:38.940 --> 01:24:40.940]  We'll talk about that with Dr. Group
[01:24:40.940 --> 01:24:42.940]  in the next segment.
[01:24:42.940 --> 01:24:44.940]  And we'll take some of your questions.
[01:24:44.940 --> 01:24:46.940]  If you'd like to call, the number is
[01:24:46.940 --> 01:24:48.940]  800-259-9231
[01:24:48.940 --> 01:24:50.940]  Ask Dr. Group
[01:24:50.940 --> 01:24:52.940]  800-259-92
[01:24:52.940 --> 01:24:54.940]  31
[01:24:54.940 --> 01:24:56.940]  Oh, and first-time callers.
[01:24:56.940 --> 01:24:58.940]  I want to give them a chance today.
[01:24:58.940 --> 01:25:00.940]  800-259-92
[01:25:00.940 --> 01:25:02.940]  31
[01:25:02.940 --> 01:25:04.940]  Again, please be a first-time caller.
[01:25:04.940 --> 01:25:06.940]  800-259-9231
[01:25:06.940 --> 01:25:08.940]  But look at these headlines.
[01:25:08.940 --> 01:25:10.940]  Ray Kurzweil.
[01:25:10.940 --> 01:25:12.940]  Humans will be hybrids by 2030.
[01:25:12.940 --> 01:25:14.940]  That's Glubals.
[01:25:14.940 --> 01:25:16.940]  That's Google's main futurist.
[01:25:16.940 --> 01:25:18.940]  Daily Mail.
[01:25:18.940 --> 01:25:20.940]  World's first biolim created.
[01:25:20.940 --> 01:25:22.940]  Dead Arm brought back to life
[01:25:22.940 --> 01:25:24.940]  in the lab could allow amputees
[01:25:24.940 --> 01:25:26.940]  to grow replacement limbs.
[01:25:26.940 --> 01:25:28.940]  Google founder
[01:25:28.940 --> 01:25:30.940]  defends accident record
[01:25:30.940 --> 01:25:32.940]  of self-driving cars
[01:25:32.940 --> 01:25:34.940]  as another one rear-ends somebody.
[01:25:36.940 --> 01:25:38.940]  And Google, of course, is defending itself.
[01:25:38.940 --> 01:25:40.940]  Facebook
[01:25:40.940 --> 01:25:42.940]  addiction linked to depression.
[01:25:42.940 --> 01:25:44.940]  Reuters is reporting.
[01:25:44.940 --> 01:25:46.940]  Oh, yeah, video game playing linked
[01:25:46.940 --> 01:25:48.940]  to lower IQ and brain damage.
[01:25:48.940 --> 01:25:50.940]  And here's another headline.
[01:25:50.940 --> 01:25:52.940]  BPA still widespread in cans.
[01:25:52.940 --> 01:25:54.940]  So, we've had a victory
[01:25:54.940 --> 01:25:56.940]  in the BPA
[01:25:56.940 --> 01:25:58.940]  that Dr. Group's dab was involved in inventing
[01:25:58.940 --> 01:26:00.940]  a famous chemist.
[01:26:00.940 --> 01:26:02.940]  We've had
[01:26:02.940 --> 01:26:04.940]  victory in getting it removed some places
[01:26:04.940 --> 01:26:06.940]  and they act like they're removing it,
[01:26:06.940 --> 01:26:08.940]  but then they just come right back with it.
[01:26:08.940 --> 01:26:10.940]  So the fight is still ongoing.
[01:26:10.940 --> 01:26:12.940]  I just threw out a whole smattering of articles
[01:26:12.940 --> 01:26:14.940]  there in this short segment.
[01:26:14.940 --> 01:26:16.940]  Which one of those you want to tackle first, Dr. Group?
[01:26:16.940 --> 01:26:18.940]  Well,
[01:26:18.940 --> 01:26:20.940]  you know, you were talking about the transgender
[01:26:20.940 --> 01:26:22.940]  and
[01:26:22.940 --> 01:26:24.940]  I mean, it doesn't matter what it is,
[01:26:24.940 --> 01:26:26.940]  whether it's a mental illness or a
[01:26:26.940 --> 01:26:28.940]  degenerative disease,
[01:26:28.940 --> 01:26:30.940]  it's all caused by the accumulation of chemicals
[01:26:30.940 --> 01:26:32.940]  and the whole transgender
[01:26:32.940 --> 01:26:34.940]  situation that's going on is really
[01:26:34.940 --> 01:26:36.940]  because we have too many
[01:26:36.940 --> 01:26:38.940]  chemicals that are in the water and the food
[01:26:38.940 --> 01:26:40.940]  and they're getting into the system and creating
[01:26:40.940 --> 01:26:42.940]  excess
[01:26:42.940 --> 01:26:44.940]  estrogen because they're endocrine
[01:26:44.940 --> 01:26:46.940]  disrupting chemicals which disrupt
[01:26:46.940 --> 01:26:48.940]  your endocrine glands and your endocrine glands
[01:26:48.940 --> 01:26:50.940]  are what regulates and secretes your hormones
[01:26:50.940 --> 01:26:52.940]  and
[01:26:52.940 --> 01:26:54.940]  what that does is it decreases
[01:26:54.940 --> 01:26:56.940]  fertility,
[01:26:56.940 --> 01:26:58.940]  it causes you to become sterile and these are
[01:26:58.940 --> 01:27:00.940]  all things like BPA,
[01:27:00.940 --> 01:27:02.940]  dioxins, BPS, the atrazine,
[01:27:02.940 --> 01:27:04.940]  phthalates,
[01:27:04.940 --> 01:27:06.940]  perchlorate, fire retardants,
[01:27:06.940 --> 01:27:08.940]  even lead, mercury, arsenic,
[01:27:08.940 --> 01:27:10.940]  all of these things that we're exposed to.
[01:27:10.940 --> 01:27:12.940]  Well, explain to me how BPA
[01:27:12.940 --> 01:27:14.940]  from just the research I've looked at, it's
[01:27:14.940 --> 01:27:16.940]  mainline science, makes females
[01:27:16.940 --> 01:27:18.940]  more female, male more
[01:27:18.940 --> 01:27:20.940]  feminine, causes
[01:27:20.940 --> 01:27:22.940]  women to degenerate in their brass
[01:27:22.940 --> 01:27:24.940]  and other sexual tissues,
[01:27:24.940 --> 01:27:26.940]  makes girls go into puberty earlier,
[01:27:26.940 --> 01:27:28.940]  so it's all
[01:27:28.940 --> 01:27:30.940]  feminizing, they know it's doing this
[01:27:30.940 --> 01:27:32.940]  and then they argue, oh, it's a mental illness.
[01:27:32.940 --> 01:27:34.940]  Well, I'm not
[01:27:34.940 --> 01:27:36.940]  a big researcher like you are, but I've done
[01:27:36.940 --> 01:27:38.940]  scientific research, my dad has done
[01:27:38.940 --> 01:27:40.940]  research, I mean, I know
[01:27:40.940 --> 01:27:42.940]  that in the embryo of fish,
[01:27:42.940 --> 01:27:44.940]  in the embryo
[01:27:44.940 --> 01:27:46.940]  of mammals,
[01:27:46.940 --> 01:27:48.940]  in the embryo of amphibians,
[01:27:48.940 --> 01:27:50.940]  we're going to come back from breaking, because
[01:27:50.940 --> 01:27:52.940]  that's what I wanted to address this in full,
[01:27:52.940 --> 01:27:54.940]  that chemicals do change
[01:27:54.940 --> 01:27:56.940]  and from what I've read, I mean,
[01:27:56.940 --> 01:27:58.940]  aren't embryos, when they're really
[01:27:58.940 --> 01:28:00.940]  small, more female
[01:28:00.940 --> 01:28:02.940]  than male and they change into male? I mean, I'm
[01:28:02.940 --> 01:28:04.940]  saying there's a layman there and that
[01:28:04.940 --> 01:28:06.940]  these chemicals basically do develop
[01:28:06.940 --> 01:28:08.940]  more feminine type traits
[01:28:08.940 --> 01:28:10.940]  in brain tissue and then I see the comments
[01:28:10.940 --> 01:28:12.940]  on info wars, no, that's not true,
[01:28:12.940 --> 01:28:14.940]  you're either male or female,
[01:28:14.940 --> 01:28:16.940]  so I think there's an argument that some of this could be natural, some of it not, but
[01:28:16.940 --> 01:28:18.940]  I mean, I know that chemicals
[01:28:18.940 --> 01:28:20.940]  are making male fish female
[01:28:20.940 --> 01:28:22.940]  and male frogs female
[01:28:22.940 --> 01:28:24.940]  or
[01:28:24.940 --> 01:28:26.940]  hemaphrodites, so
[01:28:26.940 --> 01:28:28.940]  the folks that are on info wars commenting
[01:28:28.940 --> 01:28:30.940]  saying I'm wrong, aren't they wrong?
[01:28:30.940 --> 01:28:32.940]  I mean, I'm going to go back into the science and do a whole report
[01:28:32.940 --> 01:28:34.940]  on this, proving it to them, but I mean,
[01:28:34.940 --> 01:28:36.940]  isn't that mainline science?
[01:28:36.940 --> 01:28:38.940]  It is mainline science
[01:28:38.940 --> 01:28:40.940]  and there's plenty of research out there
[01:28:40.940 --> 01:28:42.940]  to back it up, I mean, BPA is
[01:28:42.940 --> 01:28:44.940]  really just a xenoestrogen
[01:28:44.940 --> 01:28:46.940]  and a xenoestrogen is a type
[01:28:46.940 --> 01:28:48.940]  of
[01:28:48.940 --> 01:28:50.940]  xenohormone or artificial hormone that
[01:28:50.940 --> 01:28:52.940]  imitates estrogen
[01:28:52.940 --> 01:28:54.940]  and I mean, everything plastic
[01:28:54.940 --> 01:28:56.940]  these days contains BPA
[01:28:56.940 --> 01:28:58.940]  the inside of cans and just because
[01:28:58.940 --> 01:29:00.940]  they said that BPA was taken out of
[01:29:00.940 --> 01:29:02.940]  baby bottles,
[01:29:02.940 --> 01:29:04.940]  that's pretty much the only thing that BPA
[01:29:04.940 --> 01:29:06.940]  is taking out. It's one of the liners of the microwavable
[01:29:06.940 --> 01:29:08.940]  so you just cook it into your food.
[01:29:08.940 --> 01:29:10.940]  Yeah, and what happens is the body
[01:29:10.940 --> 01:29:12.940]  identifies BPA
[01:29:12.940 --> 01:29:14.940]  as the real thing. It thinks the BPA
[01:29:14.940 --> 01:29:16.940]  is actually estrogen
[01:29:16.940 --> 01:29:18.940]  so what you're having is hormone
[01:29:18.940 --> 01:29:20.940]  replacement therapy, courtesy
[01:29:20.940 --> 01:29:22.940]  of the government, on every single person.
[01:29:22.940 --> 01:29:24.940]  So it's like a man that chooses to be a woman
[01:29:24.940 --> 01:29:26.940]  taking it to become a trainee.
[01:29:26.940 --> 01:29:28.940]  Yeah, because your body
[01:29:28.940 --> 01:29:30.940]  behaves like it's loaded with
[01:29:30.940 --> 01:29:32.940]  estrogen and that affects fertility,
[01:29:32.940 --> 01:29:34.940]  breast health, you can grow breast
[01:29:34.940 --> 01:29:36.940]  Does it affect sexual persuasion?
[01:29:36.940 --> 01:29:38.940]  Absolutely it does.
[01:29:38.940 --> 01:29:40.940]  And the brain, especially for the pregnant mother
[01:29:40.940 --> 01:29:42.940]  and these are all documented studies and
[01:29:42.940 --> 01:29:44.940]  I want to do this. I want to get you to town with the studies
[01:29:44.940 --> 01:29:46.940]  and do a whole hour special on this
[01:29:46.940 --> 01:29:48.940]  because I'm sick of folks saying it in true. We'll be back.
[01:29:48.940 --> 01:29:50.940]  We're on the march.
[01:29:50.940 --> 01:29:52.940]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:29:52.940 --> 01:29:54.940]  Alex Jones and the GCN
[01:29:54.940 --> 01:30:04.940]  Radio Network.
[01:30:24.940 --> 01:30:26.940]  The State Department responded saying the funding cut
[01:30:26.940 --> 01:30:28.940]  would only further cripple its efforts.
[01:30:28.940 --> 01:30:30.940]  After all, it's not just the Benghazi
[01:30:30.940 --> 01:30:32.940]  scandal and Hillary's email practices.
[01:30:32.940 --> 01:30:34.940]  The state's also dealing with massive
[01:30:34.940 --> 01:30:36.940]  FOIA requests for how contributions
[01:30:36.940 --> 01:30:38.940]  to the Clinton Foundation
[01:30:38.940 --> 01:30:40.940]  may or may not have influenced
[01:30:40.940 --> 01:30:42.940]  their efforts.
[01:30:42.940 --> 01:30:44.940]  The State Department responded saying
[01:30:44.940 --> 01:30:46.940]  the funding cut would only further cripple
[01:30:46.940 --> 01:30:48.940]  its efforts. After all, it's not just
[01:30:48.940 --> 01:30:50.940]  the Benghazi scandal and Hillary's
[01:30:50.940 --> 01:30:52.940]  email practices. The state's also dealing
[01:30:52.940 --> 01:30:54.940]  with massive FOIA requests for how
[01:30:54.940 --> 01:30:56.940]  contributions to the Clinton Foundation
[01:30:56.940 --> 01:30:58.940]  may or may not have influenced
[01:30:58.940 --> 01:31:00.940]  Clinton on the job.
[01:31:00.940 --> 01:31:02.940]  Leanne McAdder reporting for
[01:31:02.940 --> 01:31:04.940]  infowars.com.
[01:31:04.940 --> 01:31:06.940]  Hey, how are you doing?
[01:31:06.940 --> 01:31:08.940]  Good, brother.
[01:31:08.940 --> 01:31:10.940]  I just recently started using your products.
[01:31:10.940 --> 01:31:12.940]  Everything you said about them is correct.
[01:31:12.940 --> 01:31:14.940]  Me and my wife both use a lot of them
[01:31:14.940 --> 01:31:16.940]  and it's made a lot of changes in our lives here.
[01:31:16.940 --> 01:31:18.940]  Thank you, brother. It's because it also funds
[01:31:18.940 --> 01:31:20.940]  our operation, but doing that, I know
[01:31:20.940 --> 01:31:22.940]  we're using synthetic chemicals.
[01:31:22.940 --> 01:31:24.940]  We do the supermail and the superfemale
[01:31:24.940 --> 01:31:26.940]  vitality, big changes, a lot of energy.
[01:31:26.940 --> 01:31:28.940]  We've gotten off to the cheap energy
[01:31:28.940 --> 01:31:30.940]  drinks, energy shots, they've got a ton
[01:31:30.940 --> 01:31:32.940]  of money there. Sourced from
[01:31:32.940 --> 01:31:34.940]  powerful organic herbs,

[01:31:36.940 --> 01:31:38.940]  concentrated, or maximum
[01:31:38.940 --> 01:31:40.940]  potency. They want to stun
[01:31:40.940 --> 01:31:42.940]  and dumb down and energy drinks and stuff
[01:31:42.940 --> 01:31:44.940]  just cover that up for a while, but then
[01:31:44.940 --> 01:31:46.940]  burn you out in my experience, whereas stuff
[01:31:46.940 --> 01:31:48.940]  that gets your glands naturally going
[01:31:48.940 --> 01:31:50.940]  goes right to the source, so it's pretty exciting
[01:31:50.940 --> 01:31:52.940]  and I love it. Visit infowarslife.com

[01:32:54.940 --> 01:32:56.940]  That's infowarslife.com
[01:33:24.940 --> 01:33:26.940]  Thank you for watching.
[01:33:26.940 --> 01:33:28.940]  If you have any questions or
[01:33:28.940 --> 01:33:30.940]  questions for Dr. Group, here in
[01:33:30.940 --> 01:33:32.940]  about 10 minutes or so, but Dr. Group
[01:33:32.940 --> 01:33:34.940]  pulling back.
[01:33:34.940 --> 01:33:36.940]  I read the news seven days a week
[01:33:36.940 --> 01:33:38.940]  and I've just seen countless studies.
[01:33:38.940 --> 01:33:40.940]  We've covered them.
[01:33:40.940 --> 01:33:42.940]  I do want to do a special report.
[01:33:42.940 --> 01:33:44.940]  We show all these studies, but I want
[01:33:44.940 --> 01:33:46.940]  you to talk about it some because
[01:33:46.940 --> 01:33:48.940]  I've got a report here where former
[01:33:48.940 --> 01:33:50.940]  John Hopkins, Chief of Psychiatry
[01:33:50.940 --> 01:33:52.940]  says being transgender is
[01:33:52.940 --> 01:33:54.940]  biologically impossible.
[01:33:54.940 --> 01:33:56.940]  Well, I think it's a perfect
[01:33:56.940 --> 01:33:58.940]  storm of things.
[01:33:58.940 --> 01:34:00.940]  You've got it in the education system
[01:34:00.940 --> 01:34:02.940]  being pushed to vulcanize
[01:34:02.940 --> 01:34:04.940]  and change society.
[01:34:04.940 --> 01:34:06.940]  As societies get older and
[01:34:06.940 --> 01:34:08.940]  more decadent,
[01:34:08.940 --> 01:34:10.940]  as empires get more decadent,
[01:34:10.940 --> 01:34:12.940]  this always happens. People just
[01:34:12.940 --> 01:34:14.940]  want to try different things.
[01:34:14.940 --> 01:34:16.940]  But the chemicals being added
[01:34:16.940 --> 01:34:18.940]  supercharges it.
[01:34:18.940 --> 01:34:20.940]  That's what they do.
[01:34:20.940 --> 01:34:22.940]  That's the effects it has
[01:34:22.940 --> 01:34:24.940]  in amphibians, fish and other mammals.
[01:34:24.940 --> 01:34:26.940]  You give them estrogen, they start behaving
[01:34:26.940 --> 01:34:28.940]  like a female.
[01:34:28.940 --> 01:34:30.940]  And when I talk about this, they have mainstream media
[01:34:30.940 --> 01:34:32.940]  come out and say, Alex is bashing
[01:34:32.940 --> 01:34:34.940]  gay, saying juice boxes make little boys
[01:34:34.940 --> 01:34:36.940]  gay. And it also, you know,
[01:34:36.940 --> 01:34:38.940]  gives them prostate cancer earlier.
[01:34:38.940 --> 01:34:40.940]  It also makes little girls go into puberty
[01:34:40.940 --> 01:34:42.940]  when they're five years old.
[01:34:42.940 --> 01:34:44.940]  I mean, this is getting crazy
[01:34:44.940 --> 01:34:46.940]  where the average age of puberty used to be
[01:34:46.940 --> 01:34:48.940]  what, 14? Now it's like 10 or 9.
[01:34:48.940 --> 01:34:50.940]  Children as young as three are going into puberty.
[01:34:50.940 --> 01:34:52.940]  Breast cancer,
[01:34:52.940 --> 01:34:54.940]  skyrocketing.
[01:34:54.940 --> 01:34:56.940]  And so, yeah, a lot of folks
[01:34:56.940 --> 01:34:58.940]  want to say it is a choice completely
[01:34:58.940 --> 01:35:00.940]  so they can judge somebody and hate them.
[01:35:00.940 --> 01:35:02.940]  I'm not about that.
[01:35:02.940 --> 01:35:04.940]  But I am about exposing the
[01:35:04.940 --> 01:35:06.940]  Brave New World aspect that
[01:35:06.940 --> 01:35:08.940]  Aldous Huxley
[01:35:08.940 --> 01:35:10.940]  wrote about in 1932 with
[01:35:10.940 --> 01:35:12.940]  Brave New World. And he gave a speech
[01:35:12.940 --> 01:35:14.940]  in 1962 at Berkeley
[01:35:14.940 --> 01:35:16.940]  saying this was a real plan
[01:35:16.940 --> 01:35:18.940]  to end the
[01:35:18.940 --> 01:35:20.940]  sexes and make us
[01:35:20.940 --> 01:35:22.940]  drones.
[01:35:22.940 --> 01:35:24.940]  Now, whether they're going to get away with it or not
[01:35:24.940 --> 01:35:26.940]  remains to be seen, but
[01:35:26.940 --> 01:35:28.940]  we're all in a giant globalist
[01:35:28.940 --> 01:35:30.940]  experiment. And I am an expert on that
[01:35:30.940 --> 01:35:32.940]  and I made the film Endgame exposing it.
[01:35:32.940 --> 01:35:34.940]  So, break down the
[01:35:34.940 --> 01:35:36.940]  science of this and what you think is happening
[01:35:36.940 --> 01:35:38.940]  with
[01:35:38.940 --> 01:35:40.940]  folks like
[01:35:40.940 --> 01:35:42.940]  Caitlyn Jenner
[01:35:42.940 --> 01:35:44.940]  and that whole cocktail
[01:35:44.940 --> 01:35:46.940]  what you think the prime driver
[01:35:46.940 --> 01:35:48.940]  of this agenda is.
[01:35:48.940 --> 01:35:50.940]  I think that the prime
[01:35:50.940 --> 01:35:52.940]  agenda
[01:35:52.940 --> 01:35:54.940]  is to
[01:35:54.940 --> 01:35:56.940]  alter our chemical
[01:35:56.940 --> 01:35:58.940]  structure in our body because you have to remember
[01:35:58.940 --> 01:36:00.940]  that these chemicals
[01:36:00.940 --> 01:36:02.940]  these
[01:36:02.940 --> 01:36:04.940]  xenoestrogens and these endocrine disrupting
[01:36:04.940 --> 01:36:06.940]  chemicals are designed
[01:36:06.940 --> 01:36:08.940]  to specifically attack
[01:36:08.940 --> 01:36:10.940]  our endocrine system
[01:36:10.940 --> 01:36:12.940]  which is our hormonal system. And it's
[01:36:12.940 --> 01:36:14.940]  not just BPA like I was saying
[01:36:14.940 --> 01:36:16.940]  earlier. There's so much glyphosate
[01:36:16.940 --> 01:36:18.940]  and so much atrazine
[01:36:18.940 --> 01:36:20.940]  in the water supply. It's
[01:36:20.940 --> 01:36:22.940]  hard to avoid this stuff. I mean
[01:36:22.940 --> 01:36:24.940]  a matter of fact, you can take people that
[01:36:24.940 --> 01:36:26.940]  have been juicing and raw vegans
[01:36:26.940 --> 01:36:28.940]  and do blood work on them. 90
[01:36:28.940 --> 01:36:30.940]  over 90% of the population
[01:36:30.940 --> 01:36:32.940]  has detectable levels
[01:36:32.940 --> 01:36:34.940]  of endocrine disrupting chemicals
[01:36:34.940 --> 01:36:36.940]  in their blood. All these
[01:36:36.940 --> 01:36:38.940]  things do is disrupt your hormones. So
[01:36:38.940 --> 01:36:40.940]  the endgame is
[01:36:40.940 --> 01:36:42.940]  population control, sterility
[01:36:42.940 --> 01:36:44.940]  when
[01:36:44.940 --> 01:36:46.940]  you don't, when you feel like a woman
[01:36:46.940 --> 01:36:48.940]  or feel like if you're a woman that feels like
[01:36:48.940 --> 01:36:50.940]  a man, you're creating
[01:36:50.940 --> 01:36:52.940]  depression, you're creating anxiety,
[01:36:52.940 --> 01:36:54.940]  you're creating more money
[01:36:54.940 --> 01:36:56.940]  to put you or diagnose
[01:36:56.940 --> 01:36:58.940]  you with mental illness.
[01:36:58.940 --> 01:37:00.940]  You're exposed, these
[01:37:00.940 --> 01:37:02.940]  endocrine disrupting chemicals can have
[01:37:02.940 --> 01:37:04.940]  such a damaging effect
[01:37:04.940 --> 01:37:06.940]  at parts per billion
[01:37:06.940 --> 01:37:08.940]  which means you only need tiny, tiny
[01:37:08.940 --> 01:37:10.940]  amounts of them. And it
[01:37:10.940 --> 01:37:12.940]  is causing sterility,
[01:37:12.940 --> 01:37:14.940]  low sperm count in men,
[01:37:14.940 --> 01:37:16.940]  infertility, it's causing
[01:37:16.940 --> 01:37:18.940]  breast cancer in women,
[01:37:18.940 --> 01:37:20.940]  prostate cancer. So
[01:37:20.940 --> 01:37:22.940]  there's a lot of different things
[01:37:22.940 --> 01:37:24.940]  I think that we're getting into.
[01:37:24.940 --> 01:37:26.940]  We are like, these chemicals
[01:37:26.940 --> 01:37:28.940]  are creating almost like
[01:37:28.940 --> 01:37:30.940]  a transgender society.
[01:37:30.940 --> 01:37:32.940]  They're the boys that are
[01:37:32.940 --> 01:37:34.940]  being born. There's like seven girls being
[01:37:34.940 --> 01:37:36.940]  born in some countries
[01:37:36.940 --> 01:37:38.940]  to every one boy because
[01:37:38.940 --> 01:37:40.940]  like you said earlier, if
[01:37:40.940 --> 01:37:42.940]  you have a lot of these chemicals, it doesn't
[01:37:42.940 --> 01:37:44.940]  allow you to change into a boy
[01:37:44.940 --> 01:37:46.940]  because we're really all made as female
[01:37:46.940 --> 01:37:48.940]  and then we eventually
[01:37:48.940 --> 01:37:50.940]  become a boy
[01:37:50.940 --> 01:37:52.940]  in the womb.
[01:37:52.940 --> 01:37:54.940]  But the restriction of this in some countries
[01:37:54.940 --> 01:37:56.940]  that have high levels of endocrine
[01:37:56.940 --> 01:37:58.940]  disrupting chemicals, you're seeing
[01:37:58.940 --> 01:38:00.940]  seven women being
[01:38:00.940 --> 01:38:02.940]  born to every one boy.
[01:38:02.940 --> 01:38:04.940]  Not only that, you have
[01:38:04.940 --> 01:38:06.940]  the accumulation of all these
[01:38:06.940 --> 01:38:08.940]  chemicals and toxins that are
[01:38:08.940 --> 01:38:10.940]  coming in to the body
[01:38:10.940 --> 01:38:12.940]  that are mixing with these endocrine
[01:38:12.940 --> 01:38:14.940]  disrupting chemicals like the GMO
[01:38:14.940 --> 01:38:16.940]  foods, the gluten
[01:38:16.940 --> 01:38:18.940]  which now has
[01:38:18.940 --> 01:38:20.940]  chemical structure
[01:38:20.940 --> 01:38:22.940]  of opiates inside of it
[01:38:22.940 --> 01:38:24.940]  which is addictive and
[01:38:24.940 --> 01:38:26.940]  that's why if you look at pictures of people
[01:38:26.940 --> 01:38:28.940]  black, white, I don't care from 100 years ago
[01:38:28.940 --> 01:38:30.940]  50 years ago, they look like
[01:38:30.940 --> 01:38:32.940]  people, they looked good.
[01:38:32.940 --> 01:38:34.940]  Everybody kind of looks like mutants now
[01:38:34.940 --> 01:38:36.940]  some more than others.
[01:38:36.940 --> 01:38:38.940]  Women don't look like women at the beach
[01:38:38.940 --> 01:38:40.940]  and when you see a classical looking woman
[01:38:40.940 --> 01:38:42.940]  it's like wow
[01:38:42.940 --> 01:38:44.940]  she looks like a woman
[01:38:44.940 --> 01:38:46.940]  and then so no one notices
[01:38:46.940 --> 01:38:48.940]  they roll out and go, men want to be girls
[01:38:48.940 --> 01:38:50.940]  now and add the social structure
[01:38:50.940 --> 01:38:52.940]  to make it acceptable
[01:38:52.940 --> 01:38:54.940]  to mainline it
[01:38:54.940 --> 01:38:56.940]  moving us towards a completely
[01:38:56.940 --> 01:38:58.940]  asexual system where we're all sterile.
[01:38:58.940 --> 01:39:00.940]  Now 90 plus percent
[01:39:00.940 --> 01:39:02.940]  sperm drop across the western world
[01:39:02.940 --> 01:39:04.940]  Brazil and others just decades
[01:39:04.940 --> 01:39:06.940]  after adopting our lifestyle, they're now
[01:39:06.940 --> 01:39:08.940]  seeing it. It is a
[01:39:08.940 --> 01:39:10.940]  plan. It is a globalist plan
[01:39:10.940 --> 01:39:12.940]  stated by them.
[01:39:12.940 --> 01:39:14.940]  Absolutely, I mean the
[01:39:14.940 --> 01:39:16.940]  FDA, first of all in 2008
[01:39:16.940 --> 01:39:18.940]  said that BPA was fine
[01:39:18.940 --> 01:39:20.940]  and nothing's wrong with it and then
[01:39:20.940 --> 01:39:22.940]  when Canada
[01:39:22.940 --> 01:39:24.940]  yanked BPA, the baby bottles off and then
[01:39:24.940 --> 01:39:26.940]  Walmart decided to yank all the baby bottles in the
[01:39:26.940 --> 01:39:28.940]  US. In 2010
[01:39:28.940 --> 01:39:30.940]  the FDA then finally
[01:39:30.940 --> 01:39:32.940]  admitted that the national toxology
[01:39:32.940 --> 01:39:34.940]  program studies were correct
[01:39:34.940 --> 01:39:36.940]  and that BPA was damaging to the brain,
[01:39:36.940 --> 01:39:38.940]  behavior, prostate gland, fetuses,
[01:39:38.940 --> 01:39:40.940]  children, but
[01:39:40.940 --> 01:39:42.940]  they didn't do anything about it. It's just
[01:39:42.940 --> 01:39:44.940]  all these government organizations
[01:39:44.940 --> 01:39:46.940]  that are designed
[01:39:46.940 --> 01:39:48.940]  to do something and protect us like the
[01:39:48.940 --> 01:39:50.940]  EPA, the Atomic Energy Commission,
[01:39:50.940 --> 01:39:52.940]  the USDA,
[01:39:52.940 --> 01:39:54.940]  the TSA, I mean all these
[01:39:54.940 --> 01:39:56.940]  generic organizations that are out there
[01:39:56.940 --> 01:39:58.940]  are not doing anything to protect us
[01:39:58.940 --> 01:40:00.940]  but they're just attacking the natural
[01:40:00.940 --> 01:40:02.940]  people and the people that are
[01:40:02.940 --> 01:40:04.940]  trying to
[01:40:04.940 --> 01:40:06.940]  rally and through activism
[01:40:06.940 --> 01:40:08.940]  shut these companies down that are damaging
[01:40:08.940 --> 01:40:10.940]  not only the people but also damaging
[01:40:10.940 --> 01:40:12.940]  the planet. Like you said, we're not
[01:40:12.940 --> 01:40:14.940]  the only ones affected by this. All the
[01:40:14.940 --> 01:40:16.940]  animals are starting to become affected. The
[01:40:16.940 --> 01:40:18.940]  bees, that's the whole
[01:40:18.940 --> 01:40:20.940]  ecosystem that we live in.
[01:40:20.940 --> 01:40:22.940]  You can search that in the Mississippi
[01:40:22.940 --> 01:40:24.940]  River and out in the Gulf
[01:40:24.940 --> 01:40:26.940]  upwards of half the fish in some of the
[01:40:26.940 --> 01:40:28.940]  trolls they do have
[01:40:28.940 --> 01:40:30.940]  both sexual organs or sterile
[01:40:30.940 --> 01:40:32.940]  or have sexual organs
[01:40:32.940 --> 01:40:34.940]  growing on the sides of their bodies.
[01:40:34.940 --> 01:40:36.940]  I mean they are so mutated
[01:40:36.940 --> 01:40:38.940]  because when they're embryos, we know
[01:40:38.940 --> 01:40:40.940]  fish and amphibian embryos
[01:40:40.940 --> 01:40:42.940]  are even more easily affected
[01:40:42.940 --> 01:40:44.940]  because they're in the water itself, not
[01:40:44.940 --> 01:40:46.940]  inside their mother. The mother acts as
[01:40:46.940 --> 01:40:48.940]  some form of a
[01:40:48.940 --> 01:40:50.940]  filter that with the fish
[01:40:50.940 --> 01:40:52.940]  and embryos they're getting a full dose and it is just
[01:40:52.940 --> 01:40:54.940]  devastating them. But see
[01:40:54.940 --> 01:40:56.940]  we're now being
[01:40:56.940 --> 01:40:58.940]  tranny fishophobic
[01:40:58.940 --> 01:41:00.940]  because we're trying
[01:41:00.940 --> 01:41:02.940]  to be mean to the sexual preference of the fish.
[01:41:02.940 --> 01:41:04.940]  No, the fish is mutated.
[01:41:04.940 --> 01:41:06.940]  The fish is dying
[01:41:06.940 --> 01:41:08.940]  but now that people have been changed
[01:41:08.940 --> 01:41:10.940]  they want to hold on to this
[01:41:10.940 --> 01:41:12.940]  chemical identity and they want to go
[01:41:12.940 --> 01:41:14.940]  all the way with more chemicals
[01:41:14.940 --> 01:41:16.940]  to become the woman, to become the man
[01:41:16.940 --> 01:41:18.940]  and it's just
[01:41:18.940 --> 01:41:20.940]  a really
[01:41:20.940 --> 01:41:22.940]  scientific program that Huxley
[01:41:22.940 --> 01:41:24.940]  wrote a fiction book about
[01:41:24.940 --> 01:41:26.940]  but later admitted. How crazy is it that his
[01:41:26.940 --> 01:41:28.940]  brother ran the UN UNESCO program
[01:41:28.940 --> 01:41:30.940]  was the top eugenicist in the world
[01:41:30.940 --> 01:41:32.940]  and the founder of transhumanism
[01:41:32.940 --> 01:41:34.940]  set our current course. His brother
[01:41:34.940 --> 01:41:36.940]  wrote a book about it and then admitted
[01:41:36.940 --> 01:41:38.940]  in his other book Brave New World
[01:41:38.940 --> 01:41:40.940]  revisited that it was an actual plan.
[01:41:40.940 --> 01:41:42.940]  So we have
[01:41:42.940 --> 01:41:44.940]  this mountain
[01:41:44.940 --> 01:41:46.940]  of a literary famous person
[01:41:46.940 --> 01:41:48.940]  telling us this isn't fiction
[01:41:48.940 --> 01:41:50.940]  and
[01:41:50.940 --> 01:41:52.940]  we're here living now
[01:41:52.940 --> 01:41:54.940]  deeply into this
[01:41:54.940 --> 01:41:56.940]  as our whole world is being hijacked by these
[01:41:56.940 --> 01:41:58.940]  mad scientists and the average
[01:41:58.940 --> 01:42:00.940]  trendy doesn't care and
[01:42:00.940 --> 01:42:02.940]  wants to eat chemicals that won't just
[01:42:02.940 --> 01:42:04.940]  change their sexuality
[01:42:04.940 --> 01:42:06.940]  and you know, bare minimum make them metrosexual
[01:42:06.940 --> 01:42:08.940]  but they want
[01:42:08.940 --> 01:42:10.940]  the cancer I guess. They want
[01:42:10.940 --> 01:42:12.940]  to be sterile because I hear them. I see
[01:42:12.940 --> 01:42:14.940]  their comments. They go good. I don't want to have kids. I'm glad
[01:42:14.940 --> 01:42:16.940]  they're sterilizing me. Humanity sucks
[01:42:16.940 --> 01:42:18.940]  anyways. I mean, it's this give up
[01:42:18.940 --> 01:42:20.940]  attitude that is just insane.
[01:42:20.940 --> 01:42:22.940]  Right? Well,
[01:42:22.940 --> 01:42:24.940]  even in 2011 Harvard
[01:42:24.940 --> 01:42:26.940]  School of Health published a study in the
[01:42:26.940 --> 01:42:28.940]  Journal of Pediatrics
[01:42:28.940 --> 01:42:30.940]  and found that pregnant mother's
[01:42:30.940 --> 01:42:32.940]  exposure to BPA and other endocrine
[01:42:32.940 --> 01:42:34.940]  disrupting chemicals correlated
[01:42:34.940 --> 01:42:36.940]  with hyperactivity, anxiety,
[01:42:36.940 --> 01:42:38.940]  aggression, depression,
[01:42:38.940 --> 01:42:40.940]  ADD and ADHD for the child.
[01:42:40.940 --> 01:42:42.940]  So again, you know, you have to look
[01:42:42.940 --> 01:42:44.940]  at all these conditions as being
[01:42:44.940 --> 01:42:46.940]  caused by some form of chemical
[01:42:46.940 --> 01:42:48.940]  coming into the body that's disrupting
[01:42:48.940 --> 01:42:50.940]  your normal brain activity.
[01:42:50.940 --> 01:42:52.940]  Sure. Well, I used to be against folks
[01:42:52.940 --> 01:42:54.940]  here and people that did testosterone replacement
[01:42:54.940 --> 01:42:56.940]  but the more I research it
[01:42:56.940 --> 01:42:58.940]  and everything and doctors
[01:42:58.940 --> 01:43:00.940]  are in the news admitting that men's
[01:43:00.940 --> 01:43:02.940]  testosterone by the time they're
[01:43:02.940 --> 01:43:04.940]  40 is half on average what it used
[01:43:04.940 --> 01:43:06.940]  to be. There is a war
[01:43:06.940 --> 01:43:08.940]  on the literal male chemical.
[01:43:10.940 --> 01:43:12.940]  You know, the scary part about it is
[01:43:12.940 --> 01:43:14.940]  I mean, there's a good news to it because
[01:43:14.940 --> 01:43:16.940]  there's a lot of things we can do to avoid these
[01:43:16.940 --> 01:43:18.940]  things and clean our body to
[01:43:18.940 --> 01:43:20.940]  prevent this thing from happening. But
[01:43:20.940 --> 01:43:22.940]  the scary thing is the done by
[01:43:22.940 --> 01:43:24.940]  design this really
[01:43:24.940 --> 01:43:26.940]  will affect you for four generations.
[01:43:26.940 --> 01:43:28.940]  This changes your genetic
[01:43:28.940 --> 01:43:30.940]  code. It literally changes
[01:43:30.940 --> 01:43:32.940]  your the way your DNA is
[01:43:32.940 --> 01:43:34.940]  and can affect you. And the studies have
[01:43:34.940 --> 01:43:36.940]  been done on mice at University of Virginia
[01:43:36.940 --> 01:43:38.940]  School of Medicine actually
[01:43:38.940 --> 01:43:40.940]  that show that four generations
[01:43:40.940 --> 01:43:42.940]  later these mice were still affected.
[01:43:42.940 --> 01:43:44.940]  So we're starting to get into these generational
[01:43:44.940 --> 01:43:46.940]  cycles and it's sad to think
[01:43:46.940 --> 01:43:48.940]  that, you know, the next four
[01:43:48.940 --> 01:43:50.940]  generations can be affected by all these
[01:43:50.940 --> 01:43:52.940]  chemicals and it's not like we're slowing down
[01:43:52.940 --> 01:43:54.940]  and eliminating the chemicals.
[01:43:54.940 --> 01:43:56.940]  They're just, it's getting worse and there's
[01:43:56.940 --> 01:43:58.940]  more glyphosate and more of these chemicals
[01:43:58.940 --> 01:44:00.940]  being sprayed and put in all
[01:44:00.940 --> 01:44:02.940]  of our food supply, the water
[01:44:02.940 --> 01:44:04.940]  and everything else. I want to go to
[01:44:04.940 --> 01:44:06.940]  phone calls and keep you a little bit in the next
[01:44:06.940 --> 01:44:08.940]  hour and then we've got
[01:44:08.940 --> 01:44:10.940]  some major media
[01:44:10.940 --> 01:44:12.940]  owner coming on
[01:44:12.940 --> 01:44:14.940]  to talk about the war on free speech
[01:44:14.940 --> 01:44:16.940]  and the war globally on internet freedom
[01:44:16.940 --> 01:44:18.940]  that we find in the TPP.
[01:44:18.940 --> 01:44:20.940]  But before we do that, I didn't plug anything
[01:44:20.940 --> 01:44:22.940]  last hour.
[01:44:22.940 --> 01:44:24.940]  I'm skipping a ton of network breaks. I'm
[01:44:24.940 --> 01:44:26.940]  so obnoxious.
[01:44:26.940 --> 01:44:28.940]  We fund ourselves with high quality
[01:44:28.940 --> 01:44:30.940]  water filtration systems that cut out the
[01:44:30.940 --> 01:44:32.940]  fluoride and the garbage,
[01:44:32.940 --> 01:44:34.940]  the glyphosates
[01:44:34.940 --> 01:44:36.940]  with the Pro Pure G2 systems that blow away
[01:44:36.940 --> 01:44:38.940]  the pollution.
[01:44:38.940 --> 01:44:40.940]  We have gotten in the T-shirts
[01:44:40.940 --> 01:44:42.940]  that we have had made that say
[01:44:42.940 --> 01:44:44.940]  Save
[01:44:44.940 --> 01:44:46.940]  America with an upside down
[01:44:46.940 --> 01:44:48.940]  flag
[01:44:48.940 --> 01:44:50.940]  and it has the US code that when the country
[01:44:50.940 --> 01:44:52.940]  is in dire straits you are to fly the flag
[01:44:52.940 --> 01:44:54.940]  upside down. It's a great conversation
[01:44:54.940 --> 01:44:56.940]  starter. On the back it says our republic is
[01:44:56.940 --> 01:44:58.940]  in distress. Ask me
[01:44:58.940 --> 01:45:00.940]  whyinfowars.com
[01:45:02.940 --> 01:45:04.940]  Purchasing the Patriot apparel helps
[01:45:04.940 --> 01:45:06.940]  with the operation.
[01:45:06.940 --> 01:45:08.940]  We are running out of the current stock
[01:45:08.940 --> 01:45:10.940]  of survival shield X2.
[01:45:10.940 --> 01:45:12.940]  Hopefully we'll just be out
[01:45:12.940 --> 01:45:14.940]  a month or so.
[01:45:14.940 --> 01:45:16.940]  Dr. Group has a small amount left
[01:45:16.940 --> 01:45:18.940]  at his major factory laboratory
[01:45:18.940 --> 01:45:20.940]  that's been produced. He does have more
[01:45:20.940 --> 01:45:22.940]  of the crystals
[01:45:22.940 --> 01:45:24.940]  that are
[01:45:24.940 --> 01:45:26.940]  mined from between 7 and 12,000
[01:45:26.940 --> 01:45:28.940]  feet.
[01:45:28.940 --> 01:45:30.940]  That supply is running low.
[01:45:30.940 --> 01:45:32.940]  You'll have to procure more. We ended up
[01:45:32.940 --> 01:45:34.940]  spending this source two years ago. The cleanest
[01:45:34.940 --> 01:45:36.940]  ever sold, ever used
[01:45:36.940 --> 01:45:38.940]  we've been able to find. It's a game changer.
[01:45:38.940 --> 01:45:40.940]  The other stuff comes from kelp
[01:45:40.940 --> 01:45:42.940]  sources which just isn't as strong
[01:45:42.940 --> 01:45:44.940]  or pure. It's a lot better than not having an eye.
[01:45:44.940 --> 01:45:46.940]  It'll die without it. But that's why this is
[01:45:46.940 --> 01:45:48.940]  so much more palatable. It's why the effect
[01:45:48.940 --> 01:45:50.940]  is so much stronger. There was a guy playing
[01:45:50.940 --> 01:45:52.940]  the accordion in an Italian food restaurant
[01:45:52.940 --> 01:45:54.940]  I was at last night and he ran over
[01:45:54.940 --> 01:45:56.940]  and was a listener. He said listen
[01:45:56.940 --> 01:45:58.940]  I took that stuff and I had to
[01:45:58.940 --> 01:46:00.940]  cut my dose in half. I totally detoxed
[01:46:00.940 --> 01:46:02.940]  lost a bunch of weight, got healthier
[01:46:02.940 --> 01:46:04.940]  broke out everywhere. All these toxins
[01:46:04.940 --> 01:46:06.940]  came out. I've had so much more energy
[01:46:06.940 --> 01:46:08.940]  but boy, it's good you tell people
[01:46:08.940 --> 01:46:10.940]  look out. Yeah, consult a physician.
[01:46:10.940 --> 01:46:12.940]  Okay, or consult a nutritionist
[01:46:12.940 --> 01:46:14.940]  or whatever. This is
[01:46:14.940 --> 01:46:16.940]  the most powerful iodine out there.
[01:46:16.940 --> 01:46:18.940]  Other stuff they sell at the store will eat
[01:46:18.940 --> 01:46:20.940]  holes in your guts. The stuff you put on
[01:46:20.940 --> 01:46:22.940]  topically.
[01:46:22.940 --> 01:46:24.940]  So again, consult your physician
[01:46:24.940 --> 01:46:26.940]  but this is a major game changer. That's
[01:46:26.940 --> 01:46:28.940]  why I've stockpiled it. And I realize
[01:46:28.940 --> 01:46:30.940]  as we're running out of it
[01:46:30.940 --> 01:46:32.940]  we were having trouble getting another
[01:46:32.940 --> 01:46:34.940]  super clean source
[01:46:34.940 --> 01:46:36.940]  and that's how we ended up finding this two years ago.
[01:46:36.940 --> 01:46:38.940]  And so
[01:46:38.940 --> 01:46:40.940]  Dr. Group, I know you want to get into Fukushima
[01:46:40.940 --> 01:46:42.940]  separately and the news article
[01:46:42.940 --> 01:46:44.940]  right here leaked Fukushima containers
[01:46:44.940 --> 01:46:46.940]  could lead to hydrogen explosions
[01:46:46.940 --> 01:46:48.940]  RT. There's 333
[01:46:48.940 --> 01:46:50.940]  of the containers. Each one could be as big
[01:46:50.940 --> 01:46:52.940]  as one of the other meltdowns
[01:46:52.940 --> 01:46:54.940]  but I don't really take this just because
[01:46:54.940 --> 01:46:56.940]  of background radiation increasing or isotopes
[01:46:56.940 --> 01:46:58.940]  or whatever. I take it because I understand
[01:46:58.940 --> 01:47:00.940]  my glands will get filled with bad halogens
[01:47:00.940 --> 01:47:02.940]  become toxic and fail
[01:47:02.940 --> 01:47:04.940]  like the thyroid and they don't fill it with good
[01:47:04.940 --> 01:47:06.940]  halogen.
[01:47:06.940 --> 01:47:08.940]  And when I forget, and that's iodine
[01:47:08.940 --> 01:47:10.940]  to take my iodine
[01:47:10.940 --> 01:47:12.940]  every day, I feel it.
[01:47:12.940 --> 01:47:14.940]  I mean it gives me a bigger boost than a cup of
[01:47:14.940 --> 01:47:16.940]  coffee. And I'm always
[01:47:16.940 --> 01:47:18.940]  hearing this from the hippies. Like I said
[01:47:18.940 --> 01:47:20.940]  20-something years ago I'd go to Barton Springs
[01:47:20.940 --> 01:47:22.940]  and see hippies and I'd say, what's that in that jug
[01:47:22.940 --> 01:47:24.940]  or that bottle?
[01:47:24.940 --> 01:47:26.940]  And they'd say, it's iodine.
[01:47:26.940 --> 01:47:28.940]  They'd be just, you know,
[01:47:28.940 --> 01:47:30.940]  super good shapes. I'm like, 70-year-old guy
[01:47:30.940 --> 01:47:32.940]  looking like he was 40.
[01:47:32.940 --> 01:47:34.940]  And then they'd go, yeah, hippie, whatever.
[01:47:34.940 --> 01:47:36.940]  But I remember
[01:47:36.940 --> 01:47:38.940]  if it's something the hippies have always known, what is it
[01:47:38.940 --> 01:47:40.940]  about iodine? What does it do?
[01:47:40.940 --> 01:47:42.940]  And I sure hope we can continue
[01:47:42.940 --> 01:47:44.940]  to get these deep earth crystal
[01:47:44.940 --> 01:47:46.940]  sources
[01:47:46.940 --> 01:47:48.940]  Dr. Groot.
[01:47:48.940 --> 01:47:50.940]  Well, yeah, I mean, you know, anytime you
[01:47:50.940 --> 01:47:52.940]  drill from deep down in the earth
[01:47:52.940 --> 01:47:54.940]  you know, you might have a time
[01:47:54.940 --> 01:47:56.940]  where just like oil drilling where it might dry
[01:47:56.940 --> 01:47:58.940]  up a little bit and you need to find some more.
[01:47:58.940 --> 01:48:00.940]  But
[01:48:00.940 --> 01:48:02.940]  another thing that I think is going on
[01:48:02.940 --> 01:48:04.940]  and this is proven by what just
[01:48:04.940 --> 01:48:06.940]  happened a few days ago at Fukushima
[01:48:06.940 --> 01:48:08.940]  when they're saying that
[01:48:08.940 --> 01:48:10.940]  Fukushima is leaking again now
[01:48:10.940 --> 01:48:12.940]  and it's the worst ever
[01:48:12.940 --> 01:48:14.940]  the readings in the port in Fukushima.
[01:48:16.940 --> 01:48:18.940]  I think that countries are now
[01:48:18.940 --> 01:48:20.940]  secretly trying to stock up on a lot
[01:48:20.940 --> 01:48:22.940]  of iodine.
[01:48:22.940 --> 01:48:24.940]  It's, you know, iodine contamination,
[01:48:24.940 --> 01:48:26.940]  iodine 131 is being found
[01:48:26.940 --> 01:48:28.940]  now in the rain and milk supplies
[01:48:28.940 --> 01:48:30.940]  and the food supplies.
[01:48:30.940 --> 01:48:32.940]  But like you said, it's not only
[01:48:32.940 --> 01:48:34.940]  the radioactive iodine
[01:48:34.940 --> 01:48:36.940]  and another thing actually that happens is
[01:48:36.940 --> 01:48:38.940]  as that iodine is leaking into the
[01:48:38.940 --> 01:48:40.940]  Atlantic Ocean, it also mixes
[01:48:40.940 --> 01:48:42.940]  with salt water. When you mix iodine
[01:48:42.940 --> 01:48:44.940]  with salt, it creates iodides
[01:48:44.940 --> 01:48:46.940]  and it can even
[01:48:46.940 --> 01:48:48.940]  produce nanoparticles of weird
[01:48:48.940 --> 01:48:50.940]  substances that can
[01:48:50.940 --> 01:48:52.940]  even be gassed off and go
[01:48:52.940 --> 01:48:54.940]  up into the atmosphere for a while.
[01:48:54.940 --> 01:48:56.940]  But my research with iodine
[01:48:56.940 --> 01:48:58.940]  is that everybody pretty much needs it.
[01:48:58.940 --> 01:49:00.940]  We're all deficient in iodine
[01:49:00.940 --> 01:49:02.940]  because there's really not any sources
[01:49:02.940 --> 01:49:04.940]  of iodine left. And guess
[01:49:04.940 --> 01:49:06.940]  what? We've been talking about
[01:49:06.940 --> 01:49:08.940]  estrogen dominance
[01:49:08.940 --> 01:49:10.940]  and endocrine disrupting chemicals.
[01:49:10.940 --> 01:49:12.940]  Well, estrogen
[01:49:12.940 --> 01:49:14.940]  actually inhibits
[01:49:14.940 --> 01:49:16.940]  the absorption of iodine.
[01:49:16.940 --> 01:49:18.940]  So you might actually
[01:49:18.940 --> 01:49:20.940]  link that and say, is there a conspiracy behind
[01:49:20.940 --> 01:49:22.940]  the endocrine disrupting
[01:49:22.940 --> 01:49:24.940]  chemicals knowing that you're
[01:49:24.940 --> 01:49:26.940]  not going to be able to get iodine
[01:49:26.940 --> 01:49:28.940]  the absorption of
[01:49:28.940 --> 01:49:30.940]  iodine if you have those chemicals in, which would
[01:49:30.940 --> 01:49:32.940]  mean soy or anything else.
[01:49:32.940 --> 01:49:34.940]  Now, the government sets
[01:49:34.940 --> 01:49:36.940]  an RDA of 150 micrograms
[01:49:36.940 --> 01:49:38.940]  a day, but they set that because that
[01:49:38.940 --> 01:49:40.940]  was the amount that would prevent
[01:49:40.940 --> 01:49:42.940]  a goiter. But they know
[01:49:42.940 --> 01:49:44.940]  that everybody needs much more
[01:49:44.940 --> 01:49:46.940]  iodine in their system, even up
[01:49:46.940 --> 01:49:48.940]  to, you know, what I take
[01:49:48.940 --> 01:49:50.940]  sometimes even up to 20 milligrams
[01:49:50.940 --> 01:49:52.940]  a day, which is 20,000 micrograms.
[01:49:52.940 --> 01:49:54.940]  I agree with you.
[01:49:54.940 --> 01:49:56.940]  Everybody needs to consult with their health care practitioner.
[01:49:56.940 --> 01:49:58.940]  But if you look around,
[01:49:58.940 --> 01:50:00.940]  we're seeing a massive increase
[01:50:00.940 --> 01:50:02.940]  in breast cancer,
[01:50:02.940 --> 01:50:04.940]  fibrocystic breast disease.
[01:50:04.940 --> 01:50:06.940]  We're talking about
[01:50:06.940 --> 01:50:08.940]  any type of glandular, prostate
[01:50:08.940 --> 01:50:10.940]  gland. All these things are
[01:50:10.940 --> 01:50:12.940]  affected by iodine,
[01:50:12.940 --> 01:50:14.940]  being iodine deficient.
[01:50:14.940 --> 01:50:16.940]  The thyroid needs about
[01:50:16.940 --> 01:50:18.940]  6000 micrograms, 3 to
[01:50:18.940 --> 01:50:20.940]  6000 micrograms every single day just
[01:50:20.940 --> 01:50:22.940]  for normal functioning.
[01:50:22.940 --> 01:50:24.940]  So if you're not
[01:50:24.940 --> 01:50:26.940]  sweating, you might be deficient in iodine.
[01:50:26.940 --> 01:50:28.940]  If you have cold hands and feet, if your
[01:50:28.940 --> 01:50:30.940]  skin is dry, you have insomnia,
[01:50:30.940 --> 01:50:32.940]  hair loss,
[01:50:32.940 --> 01:50:34.940]  mental illness, again
[01:50:34.940 --> 01:50:36.940]  linked to iodine deficiency, depression,
[01:50:36.940 --> 01:50:38.940]  anxiety,
[01:50:38.940 --> 01:50:40.940]  low immune system, weight
[01:50:40.940 --> 01:50:42.940]  gain,
[01:50:42.940 --> 01:50:44.940]  pregnancy and miscarriages are being
[01:50:44.940 --> 01:50:46.940]  linked to iodine deficiency. Fibromyalgia
[01:50:46.940 --> 01:50:48.940]  is a deficiency.
[01:50:48.940 --> 01:50:50.940]  Iodine is a powerful
[01:50:50.940 --> 01:50:52.940]  antimicrobial.
[01:50:52.940 --> 01:50:54.940]  It was
[01:50:54.940 --> 01:50:56.940]  studies have been done on iodine which was
[01:50:56.940 --> 01:50:58.940]  suspended in a solution and it inactivated
[01:50:58.940 --> 01:51:00.940]  viruses at delusions
[01:51:00.940 --> 01:51:02.940]  of like one in one million.
[01:51:02.940 --> 01:51:04.940]  So iodine
[01:51:04.940 --> 01:51:06.940]  is just something
[01:51:06.940 --> 01:51:08.940]  that I feel every person
[01:51:08.940 --> 01:51:10.940]  they've done studies on pregnant mothers and found
[01:51:10.940 --> 01:51:12.940]  out that they're deficient in iodine.
[01:51:12.940 --> 01:51:14.940]  Something that I use
[01:51:14.940 --> 01:51:16.940]  my kids take and
[01:51:16.940 --> 01:51:18.940]  something that I feel is necessary
[01:51:18.940 --> 01:51:20.940]  because it's not just us saying
[01:51:20.940 --> 01:51:22.940]  that everybody's iodine deficient. The
[01:51:22.940 --> 01:51:24.940]  World Health Organization's
[01:51:24.940 --> 01:51:26.940]  Department of Nutrition and Health and Development came out
[01:51:26.940 --> 01:51:28.940]  and said that iodine
[01:51:28.940 --> 01:51:30.940]  deficiency is a public health problem in
[01:51:30.940 --> 01:51:32.940]  54 countries.
[01:51:34.940 --> 01:51:36.940]  Elemental iodine
[01:51:36.940 --> 01:51:38.940]  is what the iodine is in its natural
[01:51:38.940 --> 01:51:40.940]  state and that's what it is deep in
[01:51:40.940 --> 01:51:42.940]  the earth and that consists of two
[01:51:42.940 --> 01:51:44.940]  iodine atoms that are bonded together
[01:51:44.940 --> 01:51:46.940]  and that is a
[01:51:46.940 --> 01:51:48.940]  highly corrosive and toxic
[01:51:48.940 --> 01:51:50.940]  compound because it's part of the halogens
[01:51:50.940 --> 01:51:52.940]  which is fluoride
[01:51:52.940 --> 01:51:54.940]  and bromine and chlorine and iodine.
[01:51:54.940 --> 01:51:56.940]  I don't want to confuse people
[01:51:56.940 --> 01:51:58.940]  explain to them we're saying
[01:51:58.940 --> 01:52:00.940]  iodine is a good halogen the problem is
[01:52:00.940 --> 01:52:02.940]  when it binds with radiation
[01:52:02.940 --> 01:52:04.940]  then it's a bad one that's why you need
[01:52:04.940 --> 01:52:06.940]  a good one so that there's no room
[01:52:06.940 --> 01:52:08.940]  for the bad one to come in.
[01:52:08.940 --> 01:52:10.940]  Well the iodine in its raw state
[01:52:10.940 --> 01:52:12.940]  can be very corrosive
[01:52:12.940 --> 01:52:14.940]  and that's even though we're taking
[01:52:14.940 --> 01:52:16.940]  the best raw state it still has to go
[01:52:16.940 --> 01:52:18.940]  through a seven step process to be detoxified.
[01:52:18.940 --> 01:52:20.940]  Explain that to people because
[01:52:20.940 --> 01:52:22.940]  I was listening to the hippies finally
[01:52:22.940 --> 01:52:24.940]  before I even knew you and I sort of
[01:52:24.940 --> 01:52:26.940]  take an iodine here and there but it would
[01:52:26.940 --> 01:52:28.940]  be giving me a stomach ache
[01:52:28.940 --> 01:52:30.940]  you name it
[01:52:30.940 --> 01:52:32.940]  the stuff they sell at the store will basically kill you
[01:52:32.940 --> 01:52:34.940]  so how is this so different
[01:52:34.940 --> 01:52:36.940]  and how is it palatable?
[01:52:36.940 --> 01:52:38.940]  Okay so when iodine comes out of the ground
[01:52:38.940 --> 01:52:40.940]  it's iodine there's two iodine
[01:52:40.940 --> 01:52:42.940]  molecules in its natural state
[01:52:42.940 --> 01:52:44.940]  so it's just two iodine atoms
[01:52:44.940 --> 01:52:46.940]  bonded together so what they did
[01:52:46.940 --> 01:52:48.940]  a long time ago was create they found
[01:52:48.940 --> 01:52:50.940]  that they could stabilize it and you show
[01:52:50.940 --> 01:52:52.940]  the pictures of when it's smoking because
[01:52:52.940 --> 01:52:54.940]  iodine will evaporate or it'll
[01:52:54.940 --> 01:52:56.940]  out gas into the air
[01:52:56.940 --> 01:52:58.940]  when it comes in contact with oxygen
[01:52:58.940 --> 01:53:00.940]  so what they figured
[01:53:00.940 --> 01:53:02.940]  a way to do was to make an iodide
[01:53:02.940 --> 01:53:04.940]  and that's what you see all the military
[01:53:04.940 --> 01:53:06.940]  and the country stocking up on is potassium
[01:53:06.940 --> 01:53:08.940]  iodide and what that is
[01:53:08.940 --> 01:53:10.940]  is the ion state of iodine
[01:53:10.940 --> 01:53:12.940]  and that's produced by bonding
[01:53:12.940 --> 01:53:14.940]  the iodine to another element
[01:53:14.940 --> 01:53:16.940]  in this case it would be potassium
[01:53:16.940 --> 01:53:18.940]  this form of iodine
[01:53:18.940 --> 01:53:20.940]  it can be ingested
[01:53:20.940 --> 01:53:22.940]  it can be applied to the skin but it's hard to
[01:53:22.940 --> 01:53:24.940]  break down in the body
[01:53:24.940 --> 01:53:26.940]  so what we did is developed
[01:53:26.940 --> 01:53:28.940]  a proprietary
[01:53:28.940 --> 01:53:30.940]  technology to where
[01:53:30.940 --> 01:53:32.940]  we take the iodine crystals out of the ground
[01:53:32.940 --> 01:53:34.940]  and those have to go through a process
[01:53:34.940 --> 01:53:36.940]  to become 99.99
[01:53:36.940 --> 01:53:38.940]  percent pure
[01:53:38.940 --> 01:53:40.940]  once we get the 99.99
[01:53:40.940 --> 01:53:42.940]  percent pure iodine crystals
[01:53:42.940 --> 01:53:44.940]  we create a nascent
[01:53:44.940 --> 01:53:46.940]  or an atomic based iodine
[01:53:46.940 --> 01:53:48.940]  that contains a single
[01:53:48.940 --> 01:53:50.940]  iodine atom so instead of something
[01:53:50.940 --> 01:53:52.940]  being bonded and there's two and that has to be
[01:53:52.940 --> 01:53:54.940]  broken in the body the nascent
[01:53:54.940 --> 01:53:56.940]  the survival shield X2
[01:53:56.940 --> 01:53:58.940]  has a iodine atom
[01:53:58.940 --> 01:54:00.940]  which is an active atom and it's easy
[01:54:00.940 --> 01:54:02.940]  for your body to absorb
[01:54:02.940 --> 01:54:04.940]  and that's why the stuff that you developed using the Russian
[01:54:04.940 --> 01:54:06.940]  technology in your own research
[01:54:06.940 --> 01:54:08.940]  turns electric blue the true color
[01:54:08.940 --> 01:54:10.940]  of real iodine not
[01:54:10.940 --> 01:54:12.940]  red like all the others is because I guess
[01:54:12.940 --> 01:54:14.940]  they're bound yours is in
[01:54:14.940 --> 01:54:16.940]  the single form right
[01:54:16.940 --> 01:54:18.940]  ours is reactive right away
[01:54:18.940 --> 01:54:20.940]  it's an atomic form it's a single bonded
[01:54:20.940 --> 01:54:22.940]  iodine it's exactly
[01:54:22.940 --> 01:54:24.940]  what the body needs to utilize
[01:54:24.940 --> 01:54:26.940]  so we shouldn't call this nascent ion
[01:54:26.940 --> 01:54:28.940]  we should call it atomic iodine well it's pretty much
[01:54:28.940 --> 01:54:30.940]  the same thing so you could come in
[01:54:30.940 --> 01:54:32.940]  some people say nascent some people say atomic
[01:54:32.940 --> 01:54:34.940]  it just means as an active
[01:54:34.940 --> 01:54:36.940]  as an active electron and touters
[01:54:36.940 --> 01:54:38.940]  why when I first started taking iodine did it make
[01:54:38.940 --> 01:54:40.940]  all this stuff come out of my pores
[01:54:40.940 --> 01:54:42.940]  well
[01:54:42.940 --> 01:54:44.940]  iodine will fight for the receptor
[01:54:44.940 --> 01:54:46.940]  sites in the thyroid gland and
[01:54:46.940 --> 01:54:48.940]  everywhere else in the body and the fat cells
[01:54:48.940 --> 01:54:50.940]  especially where toxins are
[01:54:50.940 --> 01:54:52.940]  kept and iodine's been proven
[01:54:52.940 --> 01:54:54.940]  to immobilize chemicals
[01:54:54.940 --> 01:54:56.940]  and toxins and heavy metals from
[01:54:56.940 --> 01:54:58.940]  the tissues and then they go back into your
[01:54:58.940 --> 01:55:00.940]  system so you can
[01:55:00.940 --> 01:55:02.940]  eliminate them properly so that's why on average
[01:55:02.940 --> 01:55:04.940]  two to three weeks after taking it you'll feel like
[01:55:04.940 --> 01:55:06.940]  crap and then
[01:55:06.940 --> 01:55:08.940]  stuff will start coming out of you you're detoxing
[01:55:08.940 --> 01:55:10.940]  it just depends on each individual
[01:55:10.940 --> 01:55:12.940]  but it depends on how much
[01:55:12.940 --> 01:55:14.940]  fluoride they have in their body the chlorine
[01:55:14.940 --> 01:55:16.940]  bromine other chemicals heavy
[01:55:16.940 --> 01:55:18.940]  metals
[01:55:18.940 --> 01:55:20.940]  lead actually mercury
[01:55:20.940 --> 01:55:22.940]  it'll just it'll start
[01:55:22.940 --> 01:55:24.940]  pushing that stuff out and then getting
[01:55:24.940 --> 01:55:26.940]  into the tissue where you need it the most
[01:55:26.940 --> 01:55:28.940]  because I mean I got energy right away
[01:55:28.940 --> 01:55:30.940]  and I had energy while I felt bad it just kind
[01:55:30.940 --> 01:55:32.940]  of felt like a hangover for a week and then
[01:55:32.940 --> 01:55:34.940]  after that it was like when you've been carrying
[01:55:34.940 --> 01:55:36.940]  say your seven-year-old on your shoulders
[01:55:36.940 --> 01:55:38.940]  up a hill and you take them off
[01:55:38.940 --> 01:55:40.940]  and it feels like you're flying you know walking
[01:55:40.940 --> 01:55:42.940]  feels so easy that's what
[01:55:42.940 --> 01:55:44.940]  it felt like I was 18 again
[01:55:44.940 --> 01:55:46.940]  after I went through that detox
[01:55:46.940 --> 01:55:48.940]  it was just amazing
[01:55:48.940 --> 01:55:50.940]  well because it's balancing your hormones out too
[01:55:50.940 --> 01:55:52.940]  because it displaces some of those endocrine
[01:55:52.940 --> 01:55:54.940]  disrupting chemicals
[01:55:54.940 --> 01:55:56.940]  and iodine is
[01:55:56.940 --> 01:55:58.940]  just an amazing substance once your thyroid
[01:55:58.940 --> 01:56:00.940]  gland starts to reactivate again
[01:56:00.940 --> 01:56:02.940]  and starts to become and your
[01:56:02.940 --> 01:56:04.940]  pineal gland starts to decalcify
[01:56:04.940 --> 01:56:06.940]  and your hormones start
[01:56:06.940 --> 01:56:08.940]  functioning usually when you have
[01:56:08.940 --> 01:56:10.940]  hormone disruption that's when all your symptoms
[01:56:10.940 --> 01:56:12.940]  start to happen your low energy
[01:56:12.940 --> 01:56:14.940]  your fatigue your mental conditions
[01:56:14.940 --> 01:56:16.940]  your weight gain around your
[01:56:16.940 --> 01:56:18.940]  stomach and your buttocks area
[01:56:18.940 --> 01:56:20.940]  your insomnia your skin issues
[01:56:20.940 --> 01:56:22.940]  you know if you have any dry skin
[01:56:22.940 --> 01:56:24.940]  psoriasis eczema
[01:56:24.940 --> 01:56:26.940]  cysts in your body
[01:56:26.940 --> 01:56:28.940]  depression
[01:56:28.940 --> 01:56:30.940]  anxiety miscarriages
[01:56:30.940 --> 01:56:32.940]  and women I mean all those things are going to be
[01:56:32.940 --> 01:56:34.940]  there's a whole slew
[01:56:34.940 --> 01:56:36.940]  of symptoms that we can
[01:56:36.940 --> 01:56:38.940]  link to
[01:56:38.940 --> 01:56:40.940]  If folks don't want to get survival shield X2
[01:56:40.940 --> 01:56:42.940]  original survival shield they can go do research
[01:56:42.940 --> 01:56:44.940]  and find good
[01:56:44.940 --> 01:56:46.940]  salts that do have good iodine
[01:56:46.940 --> 01:56:48.940]  correct
[01:56:48.940 --> 01:56:50.940]  well you can get a Himalayan crystal
[01:56:50.940 --> 01:56:52.940]  salt and that's going to have some good
[01:56:52.940 --> 01:56:54.940]  iodine in it but again it's probably going to be
[01:56:54.940 --> 01:56:56.940]  bonded to a sodium or a potassium
[01:56:56.940 --> 01:56:58.940]  there's no
[01:56:58.940 --> 01:57:00.940]  form of iodine like the
[01:57:00.940 --> 01:57:02.940]  X2 out there and it's easy
[01:57:02.940 --> 01:57:04.940]  to take you're probably even
[01:57:04.940 --> 01:57:06.940]  in the salts not going to get enough
[01:57:06.940 --> 01:57:08.940]  but still it's better than nothing
[01:57:08.940 --> 01:57:10.940]  it's better than nothing it's better than nothing
[01:57:10.940 --> 01:57:12.940]  but you got to remember think of all the chemicals
[01:57:12.940 --> 01:57:14.940]  that you're bringing into your body how many people out there
[01:57:14.940 --> 01:57:16.940]  have mercury amalgam fillings
[01:57:16.940 --> 01:57:18.940]  they're constantly getting mercury gas
[01:57:18.940 --> 01:57:20.940]  leaking into their brain and their bloodstream
[01:57:20.940 --> 01:57:22.940]  all the chemicals
[01:57:22.940 --> 01:57:24.940]  let me ask you to go to break and then come back and take calls
[01:57:24.940 --> 01:57:26.940]  we got Dave
[01:57:26.940 --> 01:57:28.940]  as a vet as a question about his meds
[01:57:28.940 --> 01:57:30.940]  Robert let's talk about mercury and dental fillings
[01:57:30.940 --> 01:57:32.940]  you just mentioned I'm going to push our next guest
[01:57:32.940 --> 01:57:34.940]  guest back I want to interview him but
[01:57:34.940 --> 01:57:36.940]  till about 15 after I'll do the whole rest of
[01:57:36.940 --> 01:57:38.940]  the hour with our next guest on media
[01:57:38.940 --> 01:57:40.940]  very important interview coming up
[01:57:40.940 --> 01:57:42.940]  but we're one minute from break here
[01:57:42.940 --> 01:57:44.940]  I just wanted to get into the fact that
[01:57:44.940 --> 01:57:46.940]  you don't want to openly say this on air
[01:57:46.940 --> 01:57:48.940]  but you were talking to some researchers
[01:57:48.940 --> 01:57:50.940]  and folks were trying to test this
[01:57:50.940 --> 01:57:52.940]  but the way you use organic
[01:57:52.940 --> 01:57:54.940]  palm glycerin
[01:57:54.940 --> 01:57:56.940]  just as a different medium than alcohol
[01:57:56.940 --> 01:57:58.940]  what's happening
[01:57:58.940 --> 01:58:00.940]  with the iodine going into that you think
[01:58:00.940 --> 01:58:02.940]  that might be making
[01:58:02.940 --> 01:58:04.940]  an even more bioavailable or what's happening
[01:58:04.940 --> 01:58:06.940]  well
[01:58:06.940 --> 01:58:08.940]  with our research
[01:58:08.940 --> 01:58:10.940]  we were looking for
[01:58:10.940 --> 01:58:12.940]  a natural non-toxic
[01:58:12.940 --> 01:58:14.940]  source to
[01:58:14.940 --> 01:58:16.940]  be able to stabilize the iodine
[01:58:16.940 --> 01:58:18.940]  in that state
[01:58:18.940 --> 01:58:20.940]  all the research before has been done with alcohol
[01:58:20.940 --> 01:58:22.940]  but we now know that alcohol in itself
[01:58:22.940 --> 01:58:24.940]  is an endocrine disrupting chemical
[01:58:24.940 --> 01:58:26.940]  so if alcohol is an endocrine disrupting chemical
[01:58:26.940 --> 01:58:28.940]  and iodine is supposed to take the endocrine
[01:58:28.940 --> 01:58:30.940]  disrupting chemicals out of the body
[01:58:30.940 --> 01:58:32.940]  then it's kind of
[01:58:32.940 --> 01:58:34.940]  you know it's kind of one of those
[01:58:34.940 --> 01:58:36.940]  you know buffering situations
[01:58:36.940 --> 01:58:38.940]  stay there, stay there, we'll be back in 70 seconds
[01:58:38.940 --> 01:58:40.940]  it's important, third hour folks

[02:00:41.100 --> 02:00:45.660]  the TPP, you name it. We're going to go to 15 after with Dr. Grip to take your calls. I appreciate
[02:00:45.660 --> 02:00:54.860]  you holding. Dave in Missouri, you have a question. Go ahead. Welcome, Dave from Missouri. Go ahead,
[02:00:54.860 --> 02:01:01.180]  you're on the ear. Hey, that caller's gone. Let's talk to Robert in Nevada. You're on the ear. Go
[02:01:01.180 --> 02:01:06.860]  ahead, Robert. Hey, Alex. I'm 14 years old. I've been watching for a while. When I was
[02:01:06.860 --> 02:01:13.820]  seven years old, I got feelings with mercury in them. After that, I was diagnosed with OCD,
[02:01:13.820 --> 02:01:17.740]  so I was just curious as if that's linked to any kind of mental disorders.
[02:01:17.740 --> 02:01:24.860]  Well, I know dentists have a record rate of dying early of all physicians, some of the
[02:01:24.860 --> 02:01:29.660]  worst. A lot of evidence shows us because they're breathing the amalgams as they drill them out.
[02:01:30.700 --> 02:01:36.460]  But that's one theory. We know mercury and lead is super bad, especially mercury.
[02:01:36.460 --> 02:01:40.460]  Uh, Dr. Grip? No, you're absolutely right. Like what you were talking about with the
[02:01:40.460 --> 02:01:45.900]  Mad Hatter and mercury has, especially when it combines with aluminum in the brain,
[02:01:45.900 --> 02:01:51.100]  it can create violent reactions. So I would definitely say that that would be something
[02:01:51.100 --> 02:01:56.620]  I would look at and mercury is extremely damaging. So my recommendation would be to find a biological
[02:01:56.620 --> 02:02:03.020]  dentist somewhere in your area that can safely remove the mercury amalgam feelings and replace
[02:02:03.020 --> 02:02:09.820]  them with maybe a non-toxic porcelain or something like that. Just make sure that he uses and the
[02:02:09.820 --> 02:02:15.820]  proper dental dams and some of them use ozone. You might want to look for one that does that to
[02:02:15.820 --> 02:02:23.180]  neutralize any of the gases the mercury releases as they remove them. Some people have gone down to
[02:02:23.180 --> 02:02:27.980]  Mexico that we've talked to to get their mercury amalgams removed and ended up paralyzed from the
[02:02:27.980 --> 02:02:33.500]  waist down because when they're removing the mercury amalgams, if you swallow a big chunk or too much
[02:02:33.500 --> 02:02:39.260]  of the gases released, it can cause such damaging neurological damage that could even paralyze you.
[02:02:40.220 --> 02:02:46.220]  Unbelievable. Reality is just so much stranger than fiction. Mercury in fillings. I mean,
[02:02:46.220 --> 02:02:50.220]  it's like mercury in the vaccines. It's insanity. Anything else, Robert?
[02:02:51.260 --> 02:02:53.580]  Oh, that's all. But thank you very much for taking my call.
[02:02:53.580 --> 02:02:58.380]  Thank you, Sir, for calling. Christina in Louisiana, you're on the air. Go ahead.
[02:02:59.740 --> 02:03:02.220]  Christian, I'm sorry. I'm going to... Sir, go ahead.
[02:03:02.220 --> 02:03:08.060]  Oh, no, it's all right. No problem. Two questions. You mentioned mercury in vaccines. That's not
[02:03:08.060 --> 02:03:13.740]  exactly what I called about, but I found myself yesterday having a more intense discussion with
[02:03:13.740 --> 02:03:18.620]  a good friend of mine that I expected to have. He came over about something else and kind of
[02:03:18.620 --> 02:03:24.140]  out of the blue, he asked me about the whooping cough vaccine. And my wife actually had a miscarriage
[02:03:24.140 --> 02:03:28.620]  recently and it reminded me with the iodine. She didn't like the taste of the X2. I'm going to try
[02:03:28.620 --> 02:03:34.140]  the original survival sheet. She preferred the taste of that. That's a completely separate issue.
[02:03:34.140 --> 02:03:38.060]  But he mentioned the whooping cough. And I can tell, and this is the whole thing, where his
[02:03:38.940 --> 02:03:45.180]  concern for me and his concern for my well-being, ultimately for our future child's well-being,
[02:03:45.180 --> 02:03:52.700]  that comes off as somehow, if I am against the vaccine, well, then it's not my wife.
[02:03:52.700 --> 02:03:57.740]  She's the better half. What does she say about it? So you can't just say, well, you're,
[02:03:57.740 --> 02:04:03.980]  I'm against vaccines or even I'm against mercury in vaccines. You almost have to go step by step
[02:04:03.980 --> 02:04:09.660]  through some phenomenological explanation of what the child goes through. Because I've had,
[02:04:09.660 --> 02:04:15.340]  I witnessed a report that I've spoken to a father who told me point blank, he watched the light
[02:04:15.340 --> 02:04:20.300]  go out in his child's eyes. But I said, well, it can be reversed. They're trying to be optimistic.
[02:04:20.300 --> 02:04:25.340]  And he says, well, yeah, but my wife, she doesn't think we should do that or she thinks it was
[02:04:25.340 --> 02:04:29.980]  God's will or he didn't really say, oh, I kind of do that. No, it's a modern human sacrifice. Look,
[02:04:29.980 --> 02:04:34.300]  there's no reason to take a hepatitis shot for a child. They're extremely dangerous.
[02:04:34.300 --> 02:04:40.060]  Because the government quietly pays off vaccine damage kids. It's a huge cover up.
[02:04:41.260 --> 02:04:45.180]  And so we're going to come back and get out of groups breakdown on that and take a few
[02:04:45.180 --> 02:04:51.980]  final calls straight ahead. But yes, they are pushing vaccines now on pregnant women.
[02:04:53.260 --> 02:04:55.980]  They know what they're doing, but they can't admit they're wrong.
[02:04:55.980 --> 02:05:05.260]  The U.S. now claims the Syrian government is working with ISIS. Officials at the U.S.
[02:05:05.260 --> 02:05:11.340]  embassy's Syria Twitter account accused the regime of aiding ISIS in the takeover of Aleppo this week,
[02:05:11.340 --> 02:05:16.860]  alleging President Assad has not only avoided engaging ISIS targets, but is actively attempted
[02:05:16.860 --> 02:05:22.780]  to bolster their position with airstrikes. Talk about a major shift in narrative since the beginning
[02:05:22.780 --> 02:05:27.980]  of Syria's so-called civil war, the Obama administration has funded and armed radical
[02:05:27.980 --> 02:05:33.500]  Islamists under the guise of supporting moderate rebels. Last February, the president even handed
[02:05:33.500 --> 02:05:39.660]  the free Syrian army the ability to order U.S. airstrikes. And one jihadist told Al Jazeera in
[02:05:39.660 --> 02:05:46.940]  2013, FSA fighters regularly sell their weapons to ISIS once receiving shipments from the U.S.
[02:05:46.940 --> 02:05:52.860]  Well, that's when the U.S. isn't accidentally dropping weapons right in ISIS territory. So
[02:05:52.860 --> 02:06:18.380]  who's really trying to bolster their position in Syria? Read the full story at infowars.com.

[02:08:32.540 --> 02:08:40.860]  of millions of people has really helped us get the word out and opened up our streams to reach
[02:08:40.860 --> 02:08:46.460]  millions of people at Bilderberg coverage and other events. One time we had over 2 million people on
[02:08:46.460 --> 02:08:55.900]  the line at one time. We had 3 million people watch over the next two days. That's something that
[02:08:55.900 --> 02:09:00.060]  definitely scares the establishment. He's going to be joining us here in about 10 minutes talking
[02:09:00.060 --> 02:09:05.020]  about attacks on the First Amendment, not just here in the U.S., but free speech overseas,
[02:09:05.020 --> 02:09:11.260]  how the TPP attacks free speech according to the WikiLeaks documents, and more. But I want to try
[02:09:11.260 --> 02:09:18.380]  to get to four or five of these calls. Felicia, Mike, Jim, Tim, and others before Dr. Group
[02:09:18.380 --> 02:09:23.980]  has to leave. But the last caller was just desperate talking about having a child and
[02:09:23.980 --> 02:09:28.460]  the doctor trying to bully him to give vaccines and then trying to go to his wife
[02:09:28.460 --> 02:09:35.020]  to get her to do it. It's just crazy how they're pushing the vaccine so aggressively right now.
[02:09:35.020 --> 02:09:42.220]  Yeah, and flu shots, flu shots and vaccines. I mean, you can get them in a grocery store now
[02:09:42.220 --> 02:09:47.980]  and get 10% off your total bill. It's one of those controversial subjects where you just
[02:09:47.980 --> 02:09:54.140]  have to do your own research. I mean, I tell people, don't believe me. Go type in vaccine
[02:09:54.140 --> 02:09:58.860]  dangers in Google and you'll find plenty of information. The MMR shot says it can give
[02:09:58.860 --> 02:10:07.260]  you type one diabetes. Well, they can give you a lot more than that. I mean, vaccines and flu
[02:10:07.260 --> 02:10:11.660]  shots, if you look at all the different ingredients inside of them, look, just go in and type in
[02:10:11.660 --> 02:10:17.660]  vaccine ingredients and take each one of them and you'll see that they change your DNA RNA.
[02:10:17.660 --> 02:10:24.620]  They alter your mental ability. They can cause cancer. They can cause all different types of
[02:10:24.620 --> 02:10:29.580]  symptoms, mental retardation. They're being manufactured by these big, evil pharmaceutical
[02:10:29.580 --> 02:10:34.620]  companies that, I mean, Bayer makes vaccines. They got caught for over a decade sending out
[02:10:35.660 --> 02:10:40.700]  factor eight for hemophiliacs that they knew had HIV and hepatitis. It was a death sentence.
[02:10:41.340 --> 02:10:46.700]  It's exactly opposite of your immune system. Your immune system, what you're designed with
[02:10:46.700 --> 02:10:53.580]  in your body, your self-healing mechanism is designed to do the best work at fighting viruses,
[02:10:53.580 --> 02:11:00.940]  bacteria, keeping your body strong and healthy. What they do, a vaccine is nothing more than a shot
[02:11:00.940 --> 02:11:09.020]  to kill your own not natural system or to reduce your own immune system. And your immune system
[02:11:09.020 --> 02:11:12.940]  has to work extra hard because it has to fight all the chemicals and toxins that are in the vaccine
[02:11:12.940 --> 02:11:18.620]  or the flu shot to begin with. So I mean, if you dig deep enough, you can even see that they list
[02:11:18.620 --> 02:11:28.460]  the dangers on the CDC's website, the FDA, the pharmaceutical manufacturers, the vaccines,
[02:11:28.460 --> 02:11:33.740]  the inserts. They want the public and safe and effective. Yeah, it's right there in plain sight.
[02:11:33.740 --> 02:11:38.940]  You just have to stop and say, wait a second, why am I going to? I mean, that's the main
[02:11:39.500 --> 02:11:45.020]  situation that we're dealing with now with food, beverages, water, exposure to any of these things
[02:11:45.020 --> 02:11:51.180]  is people don't just say, wait, let me see what's in this beverage before I drink it. Let me see
[02:11:51.180 --> 02:11:55.660]  what's in this food before I eat it. Let me research what's in this vaccine or flu shot
[02:11:55.660 --> 02:12:01.260]  before I stick it in my body. That's right. All right. I want to go through these calls. Mike
[02:12:01.260 --> 02:12:09.260]  in Arizona, you're on the air. Go ahead. Hey, guys, I was thinking of an idea for a product
[02:12:09.260 --> 02:12:16.380]  that would help maybe come off oxytocins or pain medicine. I know a lot of people that struggle
[02:12:16.380 --> 02:12:22.460]  with it. I myself, and I've been trying for a really long time. And I know everything that I've
[02:12:22.460 --> 02:12:31.100]  read says to ease off of it. But by the time you ease off of it and you, the medicine starts to work
[02:12:31.100 --> 02:12:37.580]  again, and then you just take more. I don't know if Dr. Group could suggest a regimen to come off of
[02:12:37.580 --> 02:12:43.820]  it. Boy, this is a big question, the age old thing of how to get off opiates. Whoever figures
[02:12:43.820 --> 02:12:48.300]  that out is going to win the Nobel Prize. Well, actually, it's the Nobel Prize for committing
[02:12:48.300 --> 02:12:52.620]  evil now. So I guess you wouldn't. You probably get assassinated. But I know there are things you
[02:12:52.620 --> 02:12:58.220]  can do with supplements. There are herbs and things I know that they've proven can help block
[02:12:58.220 --> 02:13:03.180]  some of the addiction and that even big farmers trying to patent some of that now. Dr. Group,
[02:13:03.180 --> 02:13:10.940]  what would you do to get off, say, a hillbilly heroin oxy cotton? Well, we've actually had a lot
[02:13:10.940 --> 02:13:16.140]  of good success with that. And it all stems back to cleansing the body, starting with intestinal
[02:13:16.140 --> 02:13:20.780]  cleansing with oxy powder and then moving on to liver and gallbladder cleansing, because you have
[02:13:20.780 --> 02:13:27.900]  to remember those pain medications will cause you to become constipated. And once you do that,
[02:13:27.900 --> 02:13:31.020]  because I've never really taken them, except when I'm on a broken leg or whatever, but I always hear
[02:13:31.020 --> 02:13:36.940]  about heroin heads and people like, don't go to the bathroom, but every two weeks. Well, because
[02:13:36.940 --> 02:13:43.580]  it alters the neurological contractions or the normal contractions of the muscles that surround
[02:13:43.580 --> 02:13:48.140]  the intestinal lining, it kind of numbs the nerves. That's why they're pain medications,
[02:13:48.140 --> 02:13:53.260]  because they numb the nerves. So you can't feel the pain. Well, you have tiny thousands and
[02:13:53.260 --> 02:13:57.740]  millions and millions of these little nerve endings all the way down through your intestinal lining.
[02:13:57.740 --> 02:14:03.740]  So because you're taking an opiate, because you're taking medications, most likely the majority of
[02:14:03.740 --> 02:14:09.260]  people that are taking pain medications or any medications are not eating healthy. These things
[02:14:09.260 --> 02:14:14.860]  numb the nerves. They leak through the intestinal lining, through leaky gut syndrome, and then
[02:14:14.860 --> 02:14:20.940]  you become constipated because you're not able to create that normal peristallic movement in the
[02:14:20.940 --> 02:14:27.660]  bowel. Yes, but you can eventually get off of those. One of the things vitamin D
[02:14:27.660 --> 02:14:35.820]  like the winter sun, it's amazing what that does for healing joint and I don't know why you're in
[02:14:35.820 --> 02:14:42.220]  pain to begin with, but some of the newest research has come out on 20,000 IUs of vitamin D. There
[02:14:42.220 --> 02:14:46.780]  was a doctor or a research scientist who wrote a book called The Miraculous Healing Benefits of
[02:14:47.420 --> 02:14:54.460]  D3 actually found that high doses of D3 can help heal all of those injuries.
[02:14:54.460 --> 02:15:01.020]  Well sure, for folks that don't know, because I did my own research, isn't D3 a master base
[02:15:01.020 --> 02:15:06.460]  hormone? I mean it's basically a hormone and that you have to have it to produce and manufacture
[02:15:06.460 --> 02:15:14.140]  your hormones and that's the same thing for basically B12, right? Yes, actually D3 is a hormone
[02:15:14.140 --> 02:15:20.460]  and I really didn't think it was that necessary. I figured we were getting enough in the sun,
[02:15:20.460 --> 02:15:26.380]  but as our research continued, I realized that there was also a conspiracy or an attack on
[02:15:26.380 --> 02:15:31.420]  blocking the UVB rays with all the chemtrails and that pretty much we're all deficient or not getting
[02:15:31.420 --> 02:15:36.620]  enough D in the body as well, but that led me to looking at, you know, there's thousands upon
[02:15:36.620 --> 02:15:41.020]  thousands of studies on the effects of D and that's another thing I think everybody is deficient
[02:15:41.020 --> 02:15:46.460]  and everybody needs. So I would highly recommend if anyone's on prescription medications, whether
[02:15:46.460 --> 02:15:52.780]  it's pain medications or whatever, there are solutions and one thing with opiates is you
[02:15:52.780 --> 02:15:59.820]  have to get off of gluten when you're slowly through time contingent, it's called time contingent
[02:15:59.820 --> 02:16:04.380]  detoxification. You don't want to cold turkey it, you want to slowly start reducing it,
[02:16:04.380 --> 02:16:08.060]  reducing it, reducing it over a period of time. Wow, this is really important. I want to have you
[02:16:08.060 --> 02:16:12.460]  on for a whole show about gluten because even in mainline literature they admit now that it
[02:16:12.460 --> 02:16:19.020]  mimics opiates. That's a whole other subject. How is grain mimicking poppy seeds?
[02:16:21.900 --> 02:16:26.860]  It's just, they're just finding new things about it all the time. I mean, I can't remember the
[02:16:26.860 --> 02:16:31.980]  chemical name of it, but yeah, I was just not too long ago reading some information that gluten
[02:16:31.980 --> 02:16:38.460]  actually does have an opiate like compound in it and that's what makes bread so addictive.
[02:16:38.460 --> 02:16:43.740]  That's why it makes you so calm and feel so good. You eat a big loaf of bread at the steakhouse.
[02:16:43.740 --> 02:16:48.940]  Exactly, exactly. And you also go through withdrawals when you get off of it. It makes
[02:16:48.940 --> 02:16:53.340]  you crave it again. So you get more and more of it. So that's something that needs to be
[02:16:53.340 --> 02:16:57.180]  amazing. We've got to go in a few minutes because our next guest is coming up. Dr. Reba,
[02:16:57.180 --> 02:17:02.620]  I appreciate all your time. Let's move quickly now to Felicia in Oregon. And again, they've
[02:17:02.620 --> 02:17:06.540]  got the call thing way back so I can barely read. I'm not complaining. It's just, that's why I'm
[02:17:06.540 --> 02:17:15.020]  butchering my names. Go ahead. You're on the air. Hi. About a year ago, after starting the X2,
[02:17:15.020 --> 02:17:21.260]  I developed symptoms that almost started, you know, re-assaulted in surgery. But in it ended up,
[02:17:21.260 --> 02:17:27.100]  I had Hashimoto's and I was told that the iodine is what made that condition player,
[02:17:27.100 --> 02:17:32.140]  the, you know, the audioimmune response to start. And I wanted to know what your opinion was and if
[02:17:32.140 --> 02:17:38.220]  I could resume taking iodine. And if not, how can I keep that part of my system straight?
[02:17:40.380 --> 02:17:45.980]  Well, I don't know, you know, too much about your history and everything, but I have not
[02:17:45.980 --> 02:17:53.340]  heard. And I also refer to Dr. Brownstein's research on Hashimoto's hypothyroidism and
[02:17:53.340 --> 02:17:59.420]  hyperthyroidism. And I haven't had a case. I don't think Dr. Brownstein has either
[02:17:59.420 --> 02:18:08.540]  of iodine, a good source of iodine ever causing a thyroid condition that would require any type
[02:18:08.540 --> 02:18:13.580]  of surgery or anything like that. So I don't know how much you were taking. As a matter of fact,
[02:18:13.580 --> 02:18:19.900]  just the opposite, we've seen people, what happens, you might, it really takes about
[02:18:19.900 --> 02:18:25.100]  six months is what we've seen to regulate out the thyroid because what happens is
[02:18:25.100 --> 02:18:32.140]  is the bromine starts releasing and the, the other halogens, which can alter different types of
[02:18:32.140 --> 02:18:36.860]  thyroid. I was about to say, even if it makes your body push out all the toxins that are built up,
[02:18:36.860 --> 02:18:41.340]  and we know that it hits women harder than that could have been the response, kind of like cleaning
[02:18:41.340 --> 02:18:45.420]  a filter out. I mean, if you're going to filter in your fish tank, you do it wrong, it dumps all
[02:18:45.420 --> 02:18:49.980]  the crap into the fish tank. And so, I mean, that's why I've said that people should consult
[02:18:49.980 --> 02:18:53.980]  their physician before using this stuff, because you got all these bad halogens in there and
[02:18:53.980 --> 02:18:58.220]  you're not going to be messing with that. You know, who knows? What happens is when you start
[02:18:58.220 --> 02:19:03.420]  taking it, you might have hypothyroid, you might have hyper, you might have Hashimoto's
[02:19:03.420 --> 02:19:07.420]  for a period of time, and that's just your thyroid getting rid of anything. The problem
[02:19:07.420 --> 02:19:12.620]  is that the doctors, when they do thyroid panels or when they do, most doctors never test
[02:19:12.620 --> 02:19:18.460]  for iodine anyway, but even the ones that do, they don't test for bromine. So you get false
[02:19:18.460 --> 02:19:24.220]  positive results, and so in order to rebalance the thyroid. Exactly. They don't test for the
[02:19:24.220 --> 02:19:29.660]  bad halogens. They'll blame iodine because you've got so much of the other stuff in you. I read
[02:19:29.660 --> 02:19:35.020]  about that. So probably that's, that's medical doctors that are always, and of course, Brownstein
[02:19:35.020 --> 02:19:41.020]  is a medical doctor, but who just don't understand it. So probably at that one point in time, you
[02:19:41.020 --> 02:19:45.660]  went in to have your thyroid checked or something. I don't know what happened, and Hashimoto's is
[02:19:45.660 --> 02:19:50.940]  nothing more than a roller coaster of your thyroid going up and down, which is completely
[02:19:50.940 --> 02:19:58.300]  normal in a lot of times with people starting on iodine. So they, they might have, you know,
[02:19:58.300 --> 02:20:03.420]  misdiagnosed you or might have said, you know. Ma'am, I appreciate your call. We're out of time,
[02:20:03.420 --> 02:20:07.260]  but that's a really important question because I'll be in restaurants, I'll be at church,
[02:20:07.820 --> 02:20:12.540]  I'll be just everywhere for years, and I see women talking about their thyroids, young,
[02:20:12.540 --> 02:20:18.300]  old. I see women everywhere who aren't fat but have a swollen goiter like we had in the 20s
[02:20:18.300 --> 02:20:22.860]  and 30s when we didn't have iodine and the salt. Of course, they've taken it out again.
[02:20:22.860 --> 02:20:27.180]  Why is it hitting women? And of course, they admit that in the news that women are more
[02:20:27.180 --> 02:20:32.540]  heavily hit than others by thyroid problems. Why is there an epidemic of that?
[02:20:32.540 --> 02:20:43.900]  Well, women have a larger thyroid gland anyway, and iodine, iodine really likes to deposit itself
[02:20:43.900 --> 02:20:49.820]  in the reproductive areas, and women have breasts, which are, you know, a lot more surface area than
[02:20:49.820 --> 02:20:54.540]  guys. And so iodine likes to accumulate in there. Women have their menstrual cycles, which are
[02:20:54.540 --> 02:20:59.900]  changes in their hormonal patterns. And if they don't have enough iodine, they can have, you know,
[02:20:59.900 --> 02:21:06.460]  those harder symptoms of PMS, endometriosis, any of the reproductive, women just have a tendency
[02:21:06.460 --> 02:21:10.780]  to have more reproductive problems than men. They have ovaries, they have eggs, they have
[02:21:10.780 --> 02:21:17.660]  a whole cycle that goes on all the time. So iodine deficiency really affects women a lot
[02:21:17.660 --> 02:21:24.060]  more than it does men. Well, again, everybody's body is different. Is it possible because people
[02:21:24.060 --> 02:21:31.500]  can be allergic to, you know, cabbage, they can be allergic to anything? Is it possible that that's
[02:21:31.500 --> 02:21:37.900]  why we say check with the physician that some people could be allergic to pure iodine? Because
[02:21:37.900 --> 02:21:42.540]  I mean, I know you'll die without it, but so, so I don't think if you have a receptor on every
[02:21:42.540 --> 02:21:47.740]  single cell in your body for a substance that you could ever be allergic to it, what happens is
[02:21:47.740 --> 02:21:53.340]  sometimes the bowel is in such bad shape that that might be taken with something else or something
[02:21:53.340 --> 02:21:59.900]  else might be inside the bowel at the time that might cause a reaction or inflammation. But as far
[02:21:59.900 --> 02:22:06.540]  as looking at a monatomic or looking at a detoxified type of iodine and knowing that you have every
[02:22:06.540 --> 02:22:12.140]  single cell in your body has an iodine receptor, to me, it would be absolutely impossible the way
[02:22:12.140 --> 02:22:19.500]  that God designed it for you to be, have an allergy to iodine in its detoxified form.
[02:22:19.500 --> 02:22:23.580]  We've got to have you back up sooner to just take a full hour of calls because we've got
[02:22:23.580 --> 02:22:28.620]  Jim wants to talk about fibromyalgia that's exploding. David wants to talk about his medications.
[02:22:28.620 --> 02:22:34.780]  Tim wants to talk about heart problems. Sean is a pharmacist and wants to talk to Dr. Group on a
[02:22:34.780 --> 02:22:39.020]  health issue. Joey wants to talk about winter sun, vitamin D question, but I'm going to, even
[02:22:39.020 --> 02:22:43.020]  though we got our next guest, I'm pushing them back. I apologize. We'll go to Sean and then
[02:22:43.020 --> 02:22:48.300]  it's a final question because Sean's a pharmacist. I want to hear what Sean has to say from Canada.
[02:22:48.300 --> 02:22:50.140]  Sean, you're on the air with Dr. Group. Go ahead.
[02:22:51.580 --> 02:22:56.700]  Yes, sir. I'm a first-time caller and greatly appreciate the opportunity to finally talk with
[02:22:56.700 --> 02:23:03.820]  you, Alex. I've actually had experience working both in Canada and the US and I just wanted to ask
[02:23:03.820 --> 02:23:10.060]  Dr. Group about his opinions on healthcare in Canada versus the US. I'm not sure if you're
[02:23:10.060 --> 02:23:15.420]  familiar with it in Canada, but here in the US, I've worked here in the US and the prices are
[02:23:15.420 --> 02:23:23.100]  just astronomical. It's not really a free market and I wanted to know what you thought about that
[02:23:23.100 --> 02:23:30.540]  because we're talking about drugs that are 30 or 40 years old that are marked up 50 to even a
[02:23:30.540 --> 02:23:35.020]  thousand percent. I thought the US was the worst about gouging for drugs. You're saying Canada's
[02:23:35.020 --> 02:23:43.500]  worst? No, actually, no, no. I'm not. What I'm saying is that it's like a drug such as maybe Dr.
[02:23:43.500 --> 02:23:48.380]  Group can comment on this, but I mean, a drug such as Declophanac, which is basically a topical
[02:23:48.380 --> 02:23:53.420]  anti-inflammatory, I could go to Canada to one of my buddy's pharmacies and buy it for about 100
[02:23:53.420 --> 02:23:58.620]  bucks. But when I was working here in the US dispensing it in the drive-through to a patient
[02:23:58.620 --> 02:24:05.340]  on workers' compensation, I mean, the drug was more than $1,400. No, that's a whole other issue.
[02:24:05.340 --> 02:24:10.780]  Absolutely. That's a whole other issue. Why does the US have the highest drug cost in the world?
[02:24:10.780 --> 02:24:15.900]  Dr. Group, that's a good way to end it. Thank you, Sean. Well, in short, that we don't technically
[02:24:15.900 --> 02:24:22.140]  have a healthcare system here or we don't have a healthcare system in Canada or anywhere where
[02:24:22.140 --> 02:24:28.460]  there's pharmaceuticals, we have a death or a disease management care system. And until they
[02:24:28.460 --> 02:24:33.820]  realize that we need to address the root cause of disease and the root cause of mental illness,
[02:24:33.820 --> 02:24:39.660]  it's going to stay that way. The reason why the drugs are so expensive is because it's all a
[02:24:39.660 --> 02:24:43.500]  money game. It's all about how much money they can make and the insurance companies are tied in
[02:24:43.500 --> 02:24:48.540]  with the pharmaceutical companies. And not only that, they're tied in with the big organizations
[02:24:48.540 --> 02:24:55.020]  like Susan B. Coman Breast Cancer Foundation, American Cancer Society and all the 501C corporations
[02:24:55.020 --> 02:25:00.620]  that people donate money to. So they take money from you every single way they can and make you
[02:25:00.620 --> 02:25:03.980]  feel bad and make you think that they're going to come up with a cure, but they never will.
[02:25:03.980 --> 02:25:07.420]  All right, Dr. Group, globalhealingcenter.com. Thank you so much for the time.
[02:25:07.420 --> 02:25:11.260]  Thank you. We're going to get our next guest on now to balance the hour a little bit into
[02:25:11.260 --> 02:25:15.260]  the next hour of overdrive. If you can stay with us on a super important topic,
[02:25:15.260 --> 02:25:20.060]  the attack on the First Amendment and free speech globally. Like I'm no rocket scientist,
[02:25:20.060 --> 02:25:24.780]  but I do read a lot of studies and research and talk to medical doctors and nutritionists and
[02:25:25.900 --> 02:25:30.780]  I try to really have a well-rounded understanding of things. If you've got a screwed up thyroid,
[02:25:31.820 --> 02:25:37.180]  which a lot of people have from all the bad halogens, and you start taking iodine and it's
[02:25:37.180 --> 02:25:43.260]  going to push that out, that just sounds like that could inflame it to me. But you do want to get that
[02:25:43.260 --> 02:25:48.380]  stuff out, but it's kind of like if you drink a bottle of Jack Daniels every day and you finally
[02:25:48.380 --> 02:25:53.180]  quit, you're going to go through the detoxes. So you might want to do it gradually. And I'm not
[02:25:53.180 --> 02:25:56.940]  giving medical advice here. I'm just saying if I had some kind of thyroid problem, I'd want to get
[02:25:56.940 --> 02:26:01.740]  all the bad halogens out. I'd probably start personally with a very small dose and just see
[02:26:01.740 --> 02:26:09.180]  what happened and let that stuff come out of there slowly. Because when a gland or something
[02:26:09.180 --> 02:26:13.580]  is already screwed up, messing with it was something really hardcore. That's what I'm saying.
[02:26:13.580 --> 02:26:20.460]  Survival shield X2, I tried to develop with group iodine that was more palatable and not as toxic
[02:26:20.460 --> 02:26:24.380]  tasting and bad on the gut as the other stuff out there being sold. Because I knew it was important.
[02:26:24.380 --> 02:26:29.740]  I knew it was giving me energy stamina, making me feel better. Just having iodine, period,
[02:26:29.740 --> 02:26:35.500]  because of deficiencies. So I wanted the best, the purest, the cleanest. But look, we're in such a
[02:26:35.500 --> 02:26:44.380]  screwed up, endocrine manipulated world that there are no silver bullets in any of this. I mean,
[02:26:44.380 --> 02:26:49.820]  it's like I had family dive infections a year and a half ago, three family members was going all over
[02:26:49.820 --> 02:26:57.980]  Texas killing folks, an uncle, a great uncle and a cousin. And, you know, I know silver in the
[02:26:57.980 --> 02:27:02.860]  levels I took, it was toxic. I couldn't get rid of this chest cold, anabox didn't work,
[02:27:03.660 --> 02:27:09.740]  a little bit of colloidal silver didn't work. I drank three bottles of colloidal silver in one
[02:27:09.740 --> 02:27:17.820]  week. That's just, I'm not telling you to do that. That is toxic. Guess what? Within two days,
[02:27:17.820 --> 02:27:25.260]  when I drunk the first bottle, it was gone. The burning, the pain, the bacteria in my throat,
[02:27:25.260 --> 02:27:29.980]  I couldn't get rid of the bleeding at night. I mean, just excruciating pain down into my lungs,
[02:27:31.180 --> 02:27:38.300]  guzzle the bottle, kept going. Boom. And you know, my pee was green though, folks. I mean,
[02:27:38.300 --> 02:27:42.700]  I don't know how good that was for my kidneys. I mean, who knows? The point is, I mean, silver
[02:27:42.700 --> 02:27:50.700]  kills stuff because it's poisonous. You fight fire with fire, but there is no silver bullet.
[02:27:50.700 --> 02:27:57.020]  What? That's what I'm telling you. This stuff is real. The stuff we sell isn't a game.
[02:27:58.860 --> 02:28:07.980]  Supernull vitality is concentrated cold-pressed herbs that are known to kickstart your body.
[02:28:08.860 --> 02:28:12.700]  I mean, you'll, everybody I've talked to has, except for one guy that I've talked to,
[02:28:13.260 --> 02:28:16.620]  massive effect. I mean, you'll notice it within days when you wake up in the morning.
[02:28:16.620 --> 02:28:21.420]  I don't have to explain what that means, but it's because we've already been jacked with and
[02:28:21.420 --> 02:28:26.940]  screwed over by the fluoride and the chemicals and the GMO. We're already screwed up. So trying
[02:28:26.940 --> 02:28:35.260]  to get it back on track is a research project. We're all guinea pigs in the West. We're all
[02:28:35.260 --> 02:28:43.420]  guinea pigs in the West. And so trying to find a way out of it isn't going to be perfect.
[02:28:43.420 --> 02:28:50.620]  I know I'm not going to just sit here and take it though. I know I've lost 60 pounds in the last
[02:28:50.620 --> 02:28:54.940]  three years. You're like, well, you don't look super fat, but you still look like you've got a
[02:28:54.940 --> 02:29:03.020]  few pounds on you. Man, let me tell you, I gained 99 pounds. 99 pounds. I've lost 60 plus. And
[02:29:03.660 --> 02:29:08.460]  you've seen the photos online. What I look like now, I mean, I barely have a tiny potbelly
[02:29:08.460 --> 02:29:13.820]  when I'm sitting down. There's almost no fat on my legs, almost no fat on my back,
[02:29:13.820 --> 02:29:20.700]  and almost no fat on my arms now. It's amazing. And I've done it. I was doing more exercise,
[02:29:20.700 --> 02:29:28.780]  actually, jogging, swimming every other day, like a mile or two miles. And I lost about 30 pounds.
[02:29:30.140 --> 02:29:37.260]  I went on, and I went on SuperMailVitalityin4sLife.com and it just, it just took me to that next
[02:29:37.260 --> 02:29:41.740]  level. And it was because I had deficiencies in all those areas. We're going to come back,
[02:29:41.740 --> 02:29:47.500]  get into the attack on free speech worldwide, key TPP news with LiveLeak.com founder Hayden Hewitt.
[02:29:49.180 --> 02:29:55.900]  We're on the march, the empires on the run. Alex Jones and the GCN radio network.
[02:30:00.460 --> 02:30:06.540]  Police departments across the country are now using an invasive surveillance tool called
[02:30:06.540 --> 02:30:13.580]  Stingrays, which use cell phone towers to intercept phone calls and text messages without warrants.
[02:30:14.780 --> 02:30:20.700]  The technology comes courtesy of the FBI, who have forced our nation's police departments into
[02:30:20.700 --> 02:30:26.780]  signing nondisclosure agreements, forbidding them from publicly talking about the technology.
[02:30:26.780 --> 02:30:32.140]  Needless to say, this is a direct violation of our fourth amendment, and they have no legal
[02:30:32.140 --> 02:30:37.340]  authority for warrantless stingray spying. Where we now know that police are collecting
[02:30:37.340 --> 02:30:43.420]  information on thousands of innocent people who are not even suspected of any crimes.
[02:30:43.420 --> 02:30:48.460]  Once again, more evidence that the police state isn't coming. It's already here.
[02:30:48.460 --> 02:30:54.540]  This is Darren McBreen, and I invite you to join the resistance. Infowars.com.

[02:32:11.580 --> 02:32:17.740]  We have rejected literally hundreds of products from the InfowarsLife line because they are not
[02:32:17.740 --> 02:32:23.500]  of the very highest quality, or because they're not 100% organic, or because they don't ask all

[02:33:23.340 --> 02:33:39.820]  Joining us is Hayden Hewitt, co-founder of LiveLeak.com, and we've used other services out there,
[02:33:39.820 --> 02:33:47.020]  and quite frankly, when we get 100,000, 200,000, 300,000, a million people on our stream,
[02:33:48.380 --> 02:33:52.220]  they would kick us off. I guess they didn't want to actually have all those viewers,
[02:33:52.220 --> 02:33:57.660]  but LiveLeak reached out to us a few years ago for our Bilderberg coverage and said,
[02:33:57.660 --> 02:34:02.380]  we'll give you the streams you need, so we'll have LiveLeak coverage from Austria with our
[02:34:02.380 --> 02:34:09.100]  three reporters if they're able to get in. They're on some of the Infowars channels that are on
[02:34:09.100 --> 02:34:13.020]  LiveLeak. In fact, we should probably today go to some of those channels and give people those
[02:34:13.020 --> 02:34:19.900]  addresses, but they'll be embedded at Infowars.com and PrisonPlanet.com, and Hayden is involved
[02:34:19.900 --> 02:34:25.900]  in the TV production as well over in the UK, and I appreciate him coming on.
[02:34:25.900 --> 02:34:30.220]  LiveLeak is a UK-based video sharing website that lets users post and share videos
[02:34:30.780 --> 02:34:38.300]  founded in October of 2006 by a team responsible for the orgish.com shock site. It aims to take
[02:34:38.300 --> 02:34:43.660]  reality footage, politics, war, and other world events, and combine them with the power of
[02:34:43.660 --> 02:34:51.180]  citizen journalism, LiveLeak.com. What I like is they haven't censored us. I mean, we wouldn't even
[02:34:51.180 --> 02:34:56.300]  be putting anything profane or violent up on some of the other streaming sites, and it was like
[02:34:56.300 --> 02:35:00.380]  government or something would have them shut us down, and it happened over and over again with
[02:35:00.380 --> 02:35:04.460]  other services. We finally got into a point where YouTube isn't censoring us too much.
[02:35:05.020 --> 02:35:08.620]  I think that's because they're in competition now with Facebook video that's starting to rise,
[02:35:08.620 --> 02:35:14.140]  but it's good to have independent groups out there. Hayden, thank you for coming on with us,
[02:35:14.140 --> 02:35:21.180]  LiveLeak.com. I know you're read up on the attacks on free speech globally, TPP, and more,
[02:35:21.900 --> 02:35:26.060]  but first off, for folks that don't know who you are, tell us a little bit about your worldview
[02:35:26.060 --> 02:35:31.660]  and what you think is happening right now on the planet. Well, you kind of have to use your
[02:35:31.660 --> 02:35:37.420]  language carefully a lot of the time, but it's quite simple that we're TPP and TTIP are concerned.
[02:35:37.420 --> 02:35:43.740]  What we're looking at is a corporate takeover of sovereign nations. There's no other way to put it.
[02:35:43.740 --> 02:35:48.460]  If you boil it down, that's all it is. Our sovereign nations are going to hand over their
[02:35:48.460 --> 02:35:56.620]  ability to rule themselves to corporations willingly. It's incredible. Wow, your Skype is
[02:35:56.620 --> 02:36:03.740]  amazing. Is it? Usually for us and for the show, it doesn't work at all, so I'm very pleased it's
[02:36:03.740 --> 02:36:08.140]  working now. Fantastic. You're involved not just in LiveLeak that you co-founded. You produced
[02:36:08.140 --> 02:36:11.340]  other shows and things. I mean, let's face it, you're kind of battle on the new world order,
[02:36:11.340 --> 02:36:20.780]  aren't you? In our own little way, I am a director of a very small media company. We provide services
[02:36:20.780 --> 02:36:26.220]  to small media businesses who can't traditionally afford those sort of services. We're even trying
[02:36:26.220 --> 02:36:33.100]  to get a campaign up and running for that. But on the side, because we have this equipment,
[02:36:33.100 --> 02:36:37.500]  this knowledge, we've decided that we need to reach out to people like Richie Allen,
[02:36:37.500 --> 02:36:42.380]  who is one of the first shows, and help people who are passionate about these sort of things,
[02:36:42.380 --> 02:36:46.780]  and who have a belief in something, whether we agree personally or not, completely irrelevant,
[02:36:46.780 --> 02:36:54.860]  much like LiveLeak, and provide them with a platform to be heard. Well, that's true renaissance,
[02:36:54.860 --> 02:37:01.660]  though, just providing a medium for true censorship-free freedom that ends up helping
[02:37:01.660 --> 02:37:08.140]  almost every time. Yeah, I mean, as long as it's legal, it doesn't encourage doing people actual
[02:37:08.140 --> 02:37:13.660]  harm. Sure. Whether I agree or not, like I say, it's completely irrelevant. I don't have to agree
[02:37:13.660 --> 02:37:18.780]  with people to support them. Seems in this day and age, there's a lot of your withers or against us
[02:37:18.780 --> 02:37:24.940]  sort of thing, but I support people I disagree with almost constantly. But isn't that what it's
[02:37:24.940 --> 02:37:30.220]  about? If you don't, you're playing somebody else's game. Well, that's a classically liberal view.
[02:37:30.220 --> 02:37:36.220]  The opposite of these modern liberal and conservative paradigm. Let's get into TPP,
[02:37:36.220 --> 02:37:41.180]  and now new documents from WikiLeaks. It's even worse than we thought all of our private data
[02:37:41.980 --> 02:37:47.020]  just turned over to multinationals. These corporations are really arrogant. I mean,
[02:37:47.020 --> 02:37:50.700]  how do they think they're going to get away with this long term, ruling us from secret?
[02:37:51.740 --> 02:37:58.620]  Because our, of course, leaders will allow it. Powerful lobbyists have been working on this
[02:37:58.620 --> 02:38:04.780]  for a long time. Let's be honest. Everybody's favorite alternative news, kicking boys, Monsanto.
[02:38:05.660 --> 02:38:09.420]  They tried to release certain products in Europe and they were told no.
[02:38:10.300 --> 02:38:16.300]  Unusually, there was no fight. It just backed off because they know TTIPS coming and they can just
[02:38:16.300 --> 02:38:22.460]  sue the hella of nations until nations can't afford it. By the time people realize what this
[02:38:22.460 --> 02:38:27.100]  actually means, because it's such a less basic for the mainstream viewers, an incredibly dull
[02:38:27.100 --> 02:38:32.300]  sounding topic, isn't it? Especially when you've got Bruce Jenner in the news with his smashing
[02:38:32.300 --> 02:38:39.260]  new pair of breasts. Much more interesting than TPP. By the time people realize, like most of this
[02:38:39.260 --> 02:38:43.820]  type of legislation and a lot of the creeping, horrific legislation we've got going around the
[02:38:43.820 --> 02:38:48.860]  corner in the UK, it is too late. Generally, people are quite up aesthetic now.
[02:38:50.700 --> 02:38:53.820]  Man, you want to do a show of your own. I mean, now you do something. You've got a great radio
[02:38:53.820 --> 02:38:57.900]  voice and also a great brain when it comes down to this because you're just calmly laying out
[02:38:57.900 --> 02:39:03.420]  like a minute or two, what I've been screaming about, you know, for hours. But I get upset. It's
[02:39:03.420 --> 02:39:10.140]  so Orwellian and surreal that foreign major corporations can be trying to make my life
[02:39:10.140 --> 02:39:15.740]  go under them and I can't even see what they're secretly doing and the mainstream media acts
[02:39:15.740 --> 02:39:19.500]  like that's okay. I mean, that is just crazy. Where do you think they're going to go next
[02:39:19.500 --> 02:39:24.380]  if they get away with this? Well, Alex says, I think it's not even, not to contradict,
[02:39:24.380 --> 02:39:29.180]  it's not even really Orwellian. It's more Huxley. It is, yeah. But they're making it seem like a
[02:39:29.180 --> 02:39:33.660]  wonderful thing and people are going, oh, that's nice. You're right. It's Huxley because Huxley,
[02:39:33.660 --> 02:39:38.060]  it's making tyranny look sexy. That's what it's all about. 1984, you know, it's tyranny.
[02:39:38.780 --> 02:39:42.780]  The protecting those, Alex, the protecting us from people that hate our freedoms. Luckily,
[02:39:42.780 --> 02:39:46.220]  those people shouldn't hate us much longer because we don't have a hell of a lot of freedoms left.
[02:39:46.220 --> 02:39:50.780]  Yeah, Bush always said they attack us because they hate our freedom. Then why are they attacking
[02:39:50.780 --> 02:39:55.420]  our, why is the government killing our freedom? Yeah, because they want everyone to love us.
[02:39:56.540 --> 02:40:00.460]  I mean, that's how they sell everything now, isn't it? We'll protect you from terrorists.
[02:40:00.460 --> 02:40:03.980]  Don't worry. We'll touch you at the airport. We're protecting you from terrorists. We're
[02:40:03.980 --> 02:40:08.140]  going to read all your emails. We're protecting you from terrorists. Everything we do. No,
[02:40:08.140 --> 02:40:12.300]  you don't need freedom. You don't need freedom because we're protecting you from terrorists.
[02:40:12.300 --> 02:40:17.420]  Alex, I come out my house every day. I go to a corner shop with an Asian guy that never blown
[02:40:17.420 --> 02:40:22.860]  up once. I've not seen a single member of the Taliban or ISIS on my road. And I don't think
[02:40:22.860 --> 02:40:26.620]  it's because we're fighting them over there or because the government have taken my freedoms.
[02:40:26.620 --> 02:40:31.660]  It's just this sale of fear so they can grab everything we've got those hours.
[02:40:32.460 --> 02:40:37.580]  Well, that's it. And then trying to create a real radical threat. They fund ISIS and other groups.
[02:40:37.580 --> 02:40:44.060]  Here's the headline from yesterday. U.S. now claims Assad working with ISIS in fullworks.com.
[02:40:44.060 --> 02:40:49.740]  U.S. changes narrative after Pentagon report proves ISIS to be western backed. And then the U.S.
[02:40:49.740 --> 02:40:56.860]  embassy tweeted reports indicate the regime of Assad is making airstrikes in support of ISIL
[02:40:57.740 --> 02:41:04.220]  the Islamic State of ISIS against Aleppo, aiding extremists against Syrian population. That is
[02:41:04.220 --> 02:41:10.700]  that is toad that is Orwellian. That is war is peace. I mean, that is crazy.
[02:41:11.260 --> 02:41:15.580]  Anyone with a pair of eyes can see that Assad and ISIS have really gone along well over the years.
[02:41:18.060 --> 02:41:22.860]  You know, people are going to read this. It's like when when the situation in Syria
[02:41:22.860 --> 02:41:27.420]  first really got going. And we were being sold the narrative through the media that it's Assad,
[02:41:27.420 --> 02:41:34.140]  the bad guy, fair enough, not the nicest of rulers. And it was a popular uprising.
[02:41:34.140 --> 02:41:39.260]  Let's arm the these aren't the extreme extremists. These are the not quite so extreme extremists.
[02:41:39.260 --> 02:41:44.620]  These are our friend. We helped create ISIS and we empowered them. And we were being sold this
[02:41:44.620 --> 02:41:48.780]  narrative that they were the good guys. And I'm lively very early in the conflict. We started
[02:41:48.780 --> 02:41:53.340]  getting a lot of footage, which very clearly spelled out that there were no good guys in this
[02:41:53.340 --> 02:41:58.460]  conflict. And now look at what it's grown into. And we've had people like Tony Blair,
[02:41:58.460 --> 02:42:04.700]  the Middle East peace envoy, saying, No, we didn't. We were not responsible for ISIS.
[02:42:05.260 --> 02:42:08.620]  Of course we are. Well, I haven't predicted two years ago, before they even made up the name
[02:42:08.620 --> 02:42:15.340]  ISIS out of Al Qaeda, that when they were done, they would claim that Assad was with the bad rebels,
[02:42:15.340 --> 02:42:20.940]  which are the majority of the rebels. And now they've done it. I mean, ISIS, the Salafist Al Qaeda
[02:42:20.940 --> 02:42:24.780]  same group through Saudi Arabia have been trying to overthrow Assad for five years,
[02:42:24.780 --> 02:42:29.660]  who is a reformer compared to his dad. He's not an angel, but compared to ISIS he is. People
[02:42:29.660 --> 02:42:33.340]  can live in peace, all different religions. You know, they're wearing suits and ties. You can
[02:42:33.340 --> 02:42:38.780]  listen to whatever music you want. You can get a beer. I mean, that's more freedom than what we
[02:42:38.780 --> 02:42:44.300]  see under these these crazy people. And they've got the nerve now to I just can't believe that our
[02:42:44.300 --> 02:42:49.500]  government is now saying Assad is with ISIS that that you think they're testing to see if we're
[02:42:49.500 --> 02:42:56.700]  done or will people buy this? I think they know people a when they sat at home in the comfort
[02:42:56.700 --> 02:43:01.260]  of the cell in the UK watching Britain's Got Talent. The biggest story in the newspapers last
[02:43:01.260 --> 02:43:08.220]  week was that a dog won a talent show. Yeah, they don't care. You sat at home, your life's okay.
[02:43:08.220 --> 02:43:14.060]  Remember, most people TPP, they won't even notice it until it really gets his teeth in or teeth it.
[02:43:14.780 --> 02:43:19.020]  They won't really notice it. Their lives will kind of continue on a groove. It's not that the
[02:43:19.020 --> 02:43:25.100]  sheep, most people want to get up, go to work, go home, spend time with the family like I'm sure
[02:43:25.100 --> 02:43:32.700]  you do. I know I do. But you don't tend to think generation I'm I'm terrified. I've got a three
[02:43:32.700 --> 02:43:38.700]  year old son. I'm terrified that he's going to grow up in a world which has been spelled out by a
[02:43:38.700 --> 02:43:44.300]  dear leader over here in the UK. We can't say anything. Oh, yeah, tell folks about Cameron's
[02:43:44.300 --> 02:43:50.460]  latest statement is Orwellian. I mean, I mean, I mean, the quote is so insane. And this is the
[02:43:50.460 --> 02:43:54.620]  best one. Okay. I can't quite exactly. I don't have it in front of me. We can pull it out.
[02:43:56.620 --> 02:44:03.500]  Essentially, they're going to clamp down on nonviolent extremism. Nonviolent, ask them what
[02:44:03.500 --> 02:44:09.900]  it is, the kind of vague but one example he gave. And if this isn't terrifying, I don't know what is.
[02:44:09.900 --> 02:44:15.740]  9 11 conspiracy theories are an example of something that could lead people to terrorism.
[02:44:17.020 --> 02:44:23.420]  Now, I think personally, he's making quite a leap there because I don't think it's good. But even
[02:44:23.420 --> 02:44:29.900]  if it did, if one or two people tend to terrorism, after religiously following 9 11 conspiracy theory
[02:44:29.900 --> 02:44:35.820]  websites and the like, is that worth criminalizing the millions of people who are interested in
[02:44:35.820 --> 02:44:41.980]  the topic? Here's what they're going to do in the UK. They will take away your right to use
[02:44:41.980 --> 02:44:46.460]  the internet. Essentially, if you want, if you get one of these banning orders for being a nonviolent
[02:44:46.460 --> 02:44:51.820]  extremist, if you want to use Twitter, it has to go through the police. And you won't be allowed
[02:44:51.820 --> 02:44:58.860]  to tell anyone why all of a sudden you've changed dramatically online. Or why your tweets have
[02:44:58.860 --> 02:45:07.820]  been written by, you know, a Tim Popp, a police officer. And even better, the prospect and this
[02:45:07.820 --> 02:45:13.980]  is amazing, that you could be arrested and tried without necessarily being told what it is you've
[02:45:13.980 --> 02:45:19.340]  done. Now, I know I've read a book about that, quite a famous one, I'm sure you have. And it appears
[02:45:19.340 --> 02:45:24.860]  David Cameron and his people did too. Let me read the quote to folks. And here's the problem. I'm too
[02:45:24.860 --> 02:45:32.460]  close to this. And so are you being somebody who's informed, Hayden. But we're here saying things
[02:45:32.460 --> 02:45:36.860]  that 50 years ago, 20 years ago, would have been heralding the end of freedom, the end of the
[02:45:36.860 --> 02:45:45.740]  West, the end of free speech. His I mean, they're saying that if you say 9 11 was a cover up, you're
[02:45:45.740 --> 02:45:49.820]  aiding terrorist. Well, no, you're not. You're saying the government's aiding terrorist, which is
[02:45:49.820 --> 02:45:54.780]  actually coming out. So they're saying and I've already been harassing the UK by police when I'm
[02:45:54.780 --> 02:45:58.700]  just not interviewing people ask me what I'm doing. So so they've already been getting this ready
[02:45:58.700 --> 02:46:04.700]  and protest bands downtown the rest of it. And now he's saying quote, for too long, we have been
[02:46:04.700 --> 02:46:10.540]  passively tolerant society, saying to our citizens, as long as you obey the law, we will leave you
[02:46:10.540 --> 02:46:16.940]  alone. It's often meant we have stood neutral between different values. And that's helped foster
[02:46:16.940 --> 02:46:23.500]  a narrative of extremism and grievance. And then if you go on to the full quote, the government will
[02:46:24.380 --> 02:46:30.380]  conclusively turn the page on this failed approach that that's Magna Carta folks, as the party of
[02:46:30.380 --> 02:46:35.980]  one nation talk about a cult, we are one nation, we will govern as one nation. That means you'll
[02:46:35.980 --> 02:46:41.020]  do what they say, bring our country together. That means actively promoting certain values,
[02:46:41.020 --> 02:46:45.340]  freedom of speech, freedom of worship, democracy, the rule of law, equal rights, regardless of race,
[02:46:45.340 --> 02:46:49.660]  gender, or sexuality. And then later in the quote, because it's a long speech, he says,
[02:46:49.660 --> 02:46:53.340]  we will no longer tolerate criticism of the government. Let me see where it says that.
[02:46:54.060 --> 02:46:57.260]  The government will challenge those who seek to spread hatred and intolerance
[02:46:57.260 --> 02:47:02.780]  by forming a new partnership of every person and organization. That's common purpose in this country
[02:47:02.780 --> 02:47:07.820]  that wants to defeat the extremists, the proposal around the response. And then he just goes any
[02:47:07.820 --> 02:47:12.060]  and then you read him say, we will no longer tolerate, you know, people saying hateful things.
[02:47:12.060 --> 02:47:18.380]  Well, that sounds nice, except they then mean 9 11 conspiracy theorists. Go ahead.
[02:47:19.580 --> 02:47:25.020]  Not just that. When they say hateful things, it's probably not my definition of hateful.
[02:47:25.980 --> 02:47:32.860]  It's that definition of hateful. It's so vaguely worded that when challenged members of government,
[02:47:33.740 --> 02:47:37.500]  I mean, let's be honest, politicians will never give you an answer anyway about anything.
[02:47:37.500 --> 02:47:43.660]  But they just simply don't know these blanket laws. Of course, people like
[02:47:43.660 --> 02:47:48.860]  Cepco's on newspapers like the Daily Mail saying, well, pretty much it's for your own safety.
[02:47:48.860 --> 02:47:54.300]  It's for your own good. We will live in this utopian dream world of everyone being nice.
[02:47:54.860 --> 02:47:58.460]  You never ever got rid of any problem by brushing under the carpet.
[02:47:59.100 --> 02:48:02.540]  You do that so long, people, there's big lumps in the carpet.
[02:48:03.100 --> 02:48:07.420]  You know, you just try to shut up folks that want to criticize the EU.
[02:48:07.420 --> 02:48:11.020]  People that want to call for sovereignty, people that don't like GMO.
[02:48:11.020 --> 02:48:13.900]  That's who they want to go after, not even the radical Islamists.
[02:48:13.900 --> 02:48:18.700]  They're going to use that threat to take everybody else's freedom. That's always been the plan.
[02:48:19.340 --> 02:48:22.940]  Yeah, and it goes right through society. The National Union of Students, which is always,
[02:48:23.660 --> 02:48:29.180]  see, he's tricky because I am definitely very liberal, but perhaps not illiberal by the modern
[02:48:29.740 --> 02:48:33.340]  sense of the word. Sure. But the National Union of Students has always been extremely left.
[02:48:33.340 --> 02:48:39.500]  But recently, they wouldn't condemn ISIS because that would be racist, although I'm not entirely
[02:48:39.500 --> 02:48:44.140]  sure what race ISIS is. But that would be racist. So we can't condemn ISIS for that.
[02:48:44.940 --> 02:48:52.620]  But we can condemn Israel because that's not racist. We can also condemn gay men for co-opting
[02:48:53.500 --> 02:48:58.380]  expressions used by black females. We can definitely condemn that. But we can't condemn
[02:48:58.380 --> 02:49:02.620]  the guy, I mean, the raping and the murdering. So you saw this. It really is the definition
[02:49:02.620 --> 02:49:07.580]  of political currentist ground matter phrase that's often used very poorly. But this is
[02:49:07.580 --> 02:49:10.300]  definitely being used. That's right. It's all selectively enforced.
[02:49:11.020 --> 02:49:16.220]  Of course. The cause is that the milking for everything is worth. The government has seen
[02:49:16.220 --> 02:49:21.980]  a tremendous in aided by people's irrational fear of bearded lunatics and sandals exploding
[02:49:21.980 --> 02:49:28.380]  everywhere. And the current zeitgeist are thinking amongst our younger people and their leaders.
[02:49:28.380 --> 02:49:33.100]  Well, after World War II, the British and the whole the UK refused to carry out e-cards and said
[02:49:33.100 --> 02:49:38.300]  it was Nazi Germany. And when Hitler was bombing the UK, bombing London, people didn't, you know,
[02:49:38.300 --> 02:49:42.940]  give up and say, let's give in. I mean, if there were real terrorists blowing us up every day,
[02:49:42.940 --> 02:49:47.180]  it's still on as dangerous as automobiles. We don't get rid of cars because they're dangerous.
[02:49:47.180 --> 02:49:50.700]  I mean, this idea that because somebody's threatening to bomb us, we change our whole
[02:49:50.700 --> 02:49:56.540]  way of life. That's just ridiculous. It even goes back even more recently, we'll say when
[02:49:56.540 --> 02:50:01.500]  the the troubles with the IRA were at the peak in this country, British security services went
[02:50:01.500 --> 02:50:06.380]  to the government saying, we want it way more far reaching powers. We want to be able to get
[02:50:06.380 --> 02:50:11.100]  everyone and the governments at the time across all parties said, oh, no, we can't do that.
[02:50:12.140 --> 02:50:17.660]  We can't do that. That's what they want. So, in fact, the war on terror is now lost.
[02:50:18.220 --> 02:50:23.420]  If there was ever such a thing is lost, the terrorists have won without destroying one of
[02:50:23.420 --> 02:50:31.100]  our major cities. They've won because we're frantically handing over freedoms at a ridiculous rate
[02:50:31.100 --> 02:50:36.940]  and handing over our countries to corporations. I never thought there'd be anyone I trusted
[02:50:36.940 --> 02:50:42.940]  less or any body I trusted less than politicians to rule us. But there are, there are corporations
[02:50:42.940 --> 02:50:49.660]  secret corporations, secret agreements, Hayden Hewitt arbitration. Absolutely. The final segment
[02:50:49.660 --> 02:50:54.860]  will come or perhaps more overdrive live leak.com Hayden Hewitt. I want to get him back on in the
[02:50:54.860 --> 02:51:21.100]  very near future. We're going to give you some more of those David Cameron quotes when we come back.
[02:51:21.100 --> 02:51:26.860]  Through extensive research and testing, we succeeded in making supernatural silver hundreds of times
[02:51:26.860 --> 02:51:31.740]  more effective. Some might call us a premium product, but we simply strive to be a product
[02:51:31.740 --> 02:51:37.580]  that worked. Supernatural silver is strong enough to fight off viruses, bacteria and fungus, but
[02:51:37.580 --> 02:51:42.620]  safe enough to be used internally or topically. And it's powerful enough that just a handful of
[02:51:42.620 --> 02:51:47.740]  applications per week can give you better results than the daily use of those bargain silvers. Go

[02:53:04.140 --> 02:53:08.300]  to your credit card. Your subway card says it's empty but you bought it yesterday. Someone's been
[02:53:08.300 --> 02:53:13.340]  in your hotel room but the desk clerk says they only show you entering the room. These are signs
[02:53:13.340 --> 02:53:19.820]  of EP. Electronic pickpocketing, payment cards, transit cards, even hotel room keys. Use a radio
[02:53:19.820 --> 02:53:24.380]  chip so you could just wave your card at the register, the turnstile, or your hotel room door.
[02:53:24.380 --> 02:53:29.420]  But what's convenient for you is also convenient for thieves waving scanners to electronically

[02:54:04.300 --> 02:54:08.940]  the co-founder of lively.com back on in the very near future. He's a great interview, really smart
[02:54:08.940 --> 02:54:14.060]  guy. I'm going to be out in the UK in a few months working on a big story. Maybe I can come by his
[02:54:14.060 --> 02:54:17.260]  offices and check out what they're doing. So they've done a lot of exciting things. They'll
[02:54:17.260 --> 02:54:21.020]  be with us for five more minutes and to overdrive, but the main transmission is going to be over soon.
[02:54:21.020 --> 02:54:26.780]  Nightly news is tonight, 7 o'clock. I did find the full quote in his speech
[02:54:28.540 --> 02:54:33.420]  from the British Prime Minister just two weeks ago. For far too long, this is in his speech,
[02:54:33.420 --> 02:54:40.460]  which we have been passively tolerant society saying to our citizens, as long as you obey the
[02:54:40.460 --> 02:54:45.260]  law, we will leave you alone. It's often meant we have stood neutral between different values,
[02:54:45.260 --> 02:54:49.820]  and that's helped foster a narrative of extremism and grievance. This government will
[02:54:49.820 --> 02:54:55.660]  conclusively turn the page on this failed approach. And even the liberal guardian breaks this down,
[02:54:55.660 --> 02:54:58.860]  because this will be used on conservatives and libertarians and everybody else for that matter.
[02:54:58.860 --> 02:55:06.620]  Designed to restrict those trying to radicalize young people, they claim it's for radical Muslims,
[02:55:06.620 --> 02:55:10.300]  it's not, is to be included in the Queen's speech. David Cameron will tell the National
[02:55:10.300 --> 02:55:15.580]  Security Council on Wednesday. Any activities that are, quote, the High Court will rule,
[02:55:15.580 --> 02:55:19.980]  harmful activities of an extremist individual, which they define, the definition of harmful is
[02:55:19.980 --> 02:55:25.420]  to include a risk of public disorder or a risk of harassment, alarm, or distress. You know,
[02:55:25.420 --> 02:55:29.180]  saying the government's behind terror attacks, that's pretty distressing, a threat to the functioning
[02:55:29.180 --> 02:55:34.220]  of democracy. They would include a ban on broadcasting and a requirement to submit to
[02:55:34.220 --> 02:55:39.660]  the police is what he just talked about in advance any proposed publication. That is the true form
[02:55:39.660 --> 02:55:44.860]  of censorship prior restraint. On the web and social media are in print. The bill will also
[02:55:44.860 --> 02:55:50.300]  contain plans for banning orders for extremist organizations. Yeah, like Michael Savage can't
[02:55:50.300 --> 02:55:56.620]  come to the UK or even guys that just teach self-defense famous, you know, Navy Seals and
[02:55:56.620 --> 02:56:01.260]  stuff can't go there because they're trying to ban, in fact, they just had the police come out
[02:56:01.260 --> 02:56:05.260]  this week. I meant to cover it on Monday. It was in the news and say, because they asked the police
[02:56:05.260 --> 02:56:11.020]  in a public forum, is any self-defense okay? And they said, no, it's all illegal. Only a rape alarm,
[02:56:11.020 --> 02:56:19.100]  a panic alarm, a horn is okay. I mean, why do you think the UK out of all countries wants this
[02:56:19.100 --> 02:56:24.140]  docile population? What's going on live leak co-founder Hayden Hewitt?
[02:56:25.260 --> 02:56:30.620]  I think that the thing about the rape alarm was kind of taking a touch our context to be fair.
[02:56:30.620 --> 02:56:33.740]  I think it's about that's what weapon you can't carry weapons in this country. I mean,
[02:56:33.740 --> 02:56:40.380]  just recently, it was Manchester or Salford, which is an adjoining city. A guy stabbed a burglar to
[02:56:40.380 --> 02:56:46.700]  death and you know, it was considered self-defense. I think there's a little bit of click baiting
[02:56:46.700 --> 02:56:53.500]  and selective reporting involved there. But the big thing with what you just spoke about there,
[02:56:54.220 --> 02:56:59.420]  do you remember when people were first concerned about the amount of surveillance where our security
[02:56:59.420 --> 02:57:04.060]  services were spying on your people, your security services were spying on our people,
[02:57:04.060 --> 02:57:10.380]  and thereby avoiding all the rules about spying on your own people? And everyone or many people
[02:57:10.380 --> 02:57:14.620]  would say, well, it's okay. If you've done nothing wrong, you've got nothing to fear.
[02:57:14.620 --> 02:57:18.860]  That's kind of changing now, isn't it? Because Cameron's basically saying,
[02:57:19.420 --> 02:57:24.780]  doesn't matter what you've done, you've probably got something to fear. You know, that thing you
[02:57:24.780 --> 02:57:30.220]  were doing that was okay yesterday is not okay today. But we might not tell you why we're arresting
[02:57:30.220 --> 02:57:36.860]  you for it. And yet still, nobody's terrified. And now they're going to try to roll it out.
[02:57:36.860 --> 02:57:40.780]  Why do you think governments are moving so fast towards classical authoritarianism?
[02:57:40.780 --> 02:57:47.500]  I imagine, and I don't have great experience in government, I'm very pleased to say.
[02:57:49.020 --> 02:57:54.060]  Once you've got a bit between your teeth, and it looks like you can get to the sort of goal you
[02:57:54.060 --> 02:57:59.500]  want, why waste time? The quicker you move, like many things in life, you know, with a business
[02:57:59.500 --> 02:58:04.780]  opportunity or anything like that, move quick, you have to careful consideration. When you do move,
[02:58:04.780 --> 02:58:10.780]  you move as fast as you can, to ensure that it happens with this, this little interference,
[02:58:11.500 --> 02:58:18.300]  like Obama trying to railroad through the TPP thing. Again, I'm just, I'm literally,
[02:58:18.300 --> 02:58:23.420]  I'll be talking about this on the Live League show later. The White House can find time to mention
[02:58:24.460 --> 02:58:29.820]  Bruce Jenner, for example, which it should be of no relevance to anyone what that man does with
[02:58:29.820 --> 02:58:35.980]  his own body. We're not against Bruce Jenner. It's just, it's just not, why are we obsessing on
[02:58:37.100 --> 02:58:41.100]  stay with us back at 70 seconds? I want to elaborate on that. Planet Jenner, I mean,
[02:58:41.100 --> 02:58:45.100]  this is not the top story. Trying to start World War Three with Russia and China is.
[02:58:45.820 --> 02:58:53.420]  I'm Alex Jones, stay with us. Introducing Secret 12, the new Info Wars Life,

[03:00:02.540 --> 03:00:09.100]  From his central Texas command center deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[03:00:09.100 --> 03:00:14.700]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN radio network. We're going to keep doing overdrive about 20
[03:00:14.700 --> 03:00:19.100]  after. If Hayden Hewitt has to go because he runs with all bunch of important stuff he can,
[03:00:19.100 --> 03:00:22.540]  or he can save us until 20 after. This is a five-minute segment, 12-minute segment coming up.
[03:00:23.180 --> 03:00:29.500]  But I tell you, CJ is in there ranting to me during the breaks about Bruce Jenner and what's
[03:00:29.500 --> 03:00:33.980]  really behind all this. And it really made a lot of sense. He's going to talk about that in
[03:00:33.980 --> 03:00:38.140]  the next segment, kind of reload and repeat what he just said to me during that 70-second break.
[03:00:38.140 --> 03:00:45.020]  But Hayden, you were talking about Bruce Jenner and all this, and why is Obama talking about it
[03:00:45.020 --> 03:00:49.980]  when you got cut off by the break? Go ahead. Yeah, well, you know, I understand the cult of
[03:00:49.980 --> 03:00:54.700]  celebrities is huge now, and we love what we can laugh in the co-reality shows. It's massive. It's
[03:00:54.700 --> 03:01:00.860]  a huge distraction. People love it. But in truth, there's no reason to care what Bruce Jenner does
[03:01:00.860 --> 03:01:06.540]  with his body. It's irrelevant. You know, the things behind it has a different debate. The fact
[03:01:06.540 --> 03:01:13.340]  that the White House, the most powerful man in the world to all intents and purposes, can have a
[03:01:13.340 --> 03:01:19.260]  chat about Bruce Jenner. But at no point will clue the American people in on legislation that will
[03:01:19.260 --> 03:01:25.180]  affect them for generations. The TPP. Yeah, absolutely. Yeah, I mean, it will. England's
[03:01:25.180 --> 03:01:29.660]  falling to tyranny. We're falling to tyranny. The whole planet is, and we're talking about a guy
[03:01:29.660 --> 03:01:34.380]  that turned into a woman. They're like, oh, you just don't like that. I don't care. I'm a total
[03:01:34.380 --> 03:01:40.780]  libertarian. But it's like, why am I being force fed on ugly tranny? I mean, I just don't get it.
[03:01:42.940 --> 03:01:47.740]  Well, I mean, that's a whole other debate I would love to have with you sometime about
[03:01:47.740 --> 03:01:53.420]  people's perceptions and the way we have a completely polarized society now. You either are A
[03:01:53.420 --> 03:01:59.420]  or B. Yeah, he's a goddess. She's a goddess. She's an abomination. Nobody's allowed nowadays to take
[03:01:59.420 --> 03:02:04.300]  the middle ground or going to know what don't care. No, that's where I'm at. I mean, I mean, that's
[03:02:04.300 --> 03:02:08.940]  where I'm at. I mean, I turned into a woman like Marilyn Monroe. I'd be like, wow, that guy looks
[03:02:08.940 --> 03:02:13.980]  like a good looking woman. I mean, but it's just it's so weird that it's a creepy Olympic athlete.
[03:02:13.980 --> 03:02:19.020]  And I can't stand the Kardashians and reality. I just hate it all. It's not that I hate, you know,
[03:02:19.020 --> 03:02:23.900]  the Kardashians themselves. I hate the whole spectacle because it is a distraction from the
[03:02:23.900 --> 03:02:30.620]  TPP and everything else. And so distraction from everything reality TV is, I mean, we don't watch
[03:02:30.620 --> 03:02:34.700]  a lot of television in my house. He's not a snobbery thing. He's like, you know, well, I don't
[03:02:34.700 --> 03:02:38.860]  need the kids bed. I'll have a chat with the wife or catch from the day, then, you know,
[03:02:38.860 --> 03:02:42.460]  I'll do a very reading show potter on the internet. I tend not to put around on the
[03:02:42.460 --> 03:02:47.580]  internet much at home because that's my entire life. But we don't watch a lot of TV. And when we
[03:02:47.580 --> 03:02:55.340]  do, I constantly find myself amazed at just the complete lack of information that's available
[03:02:55.340 --> 03:03:00.780]  on television. Now, it's kind of scary. Oh, yeah. Once you go internet, you can't go back. I mean,
[03:03:00.780 --> 03:03:07.660]  I know I never watch television anymore. How can you watch the news? I turned on the ITB,
[03:03:07.660 --> 03:03:13.740]  which is independent television news here in the UK. I turned that on. I'd sit through 20 minutes
[03:03:13.740 --> 03:03:21.660]  of FIFA. Yeah. So what is corrupt? Big, no kidding. A huge organization responsible for
[03:03:21.660 --> 03:03:28.300]  billions of hundreds of billions of pounds. Income is corrupt. No kidding. But why? Who didn't know?
[03:03:28.300 --> 03:03:32.140]  Now, all right, let us know. Yeah, the soccer association is not capturing our countries.
[03:03:33.180 --> 03:03:39.340]  No, as far as I know, FIFA wouldn't slap an order on me to not speak online without being vetted by
[03:03:39.340 --> 03:03:44.860]  a police officer. They might want to, but I don't know. By the way, what's going to happen to LiveLeak
[03:03:44.860 --> 03:03:48.460]  if Cameron actually gets all this through? They're going to put prior restraint on you. You're
[03:03:48.460 --> 03:03:53.420]  going to have to move somewhere else. Well, LiveLeak isn't... I know it's written on Wikipedia,
[03:03:53.420 --> 03:03:56.860]  but we didn't write that because we actually follow the Wiki rules. We don't edit anything about
[03:03:56.860 --> 03:04:02.860]  our own stuff. You're not really based in the UK. No, I'm based in the UK. LiveLeak is a very,
[03:04:02.860 --> 03:04:08.940]  very unusual organization. And as much as it's a genuine cooperative, there's no single head.
[03:04:08.940 --> 03:04:13.820]  I just drew the straw that I'm out from talking to people and, you know, because I enjoy it.
[03:04:13.820 --> 03:04:18.540]  There's no head to chop off because there is no head. No. I mean, it's, you know,
[03:04:19.340 --> 03:04:23.660]  it's a very, like I say, there's no shiny building with Chrome. There's no
[03:04:25.020 --> 03:04:30.780]  sort of shiny suited investors. There's nothing like that. He's a genuine independent entity.

[03:04:34.540 --> 03:04:38.700]  You know? Hold on. Hey, do you have to go or can you do one more segment?
[03:04:39.420 --> 03:04:43.660]  I'll do one more segment. All right. All right. Great. Hayden Hue at LiveLeak.com.
[03:04:44.460 --> 03:04:47.820]  It's a great site. I mean, you want to know where I watch TV. It's places like that
[03:04:49.180 --> 03:04:52.780]  because YouTube's so commercialized and stuff that I'm not even against people having ads.
[03:04:52.780 --> 03:04:55.820]  I mean, we have two. It's just that I like to go over there because you can find some really
[03:04:55.820 --> 03:05:08.300]  interesting real human stuff at LiveLeak.

[03:08:01.980 --> 03:08:04.060]  You are obsolete, Mr. Wordsworth.
[03:08:04.060 --> 03:08:07.260]  A lie. No man is obsolete.
[03:08:07.260 --> 03:08:12.300]  You have no function, Mr. Wordsworth. You're an anachronism, like a ghost from another time.
[03:08:12.300 --> 03:08:17.820]  I am nothing more than a reminder to you that you cannot destroy truth by burning pages.
[03:08:17.820 --> 03:08:21.820]  You're a bug, Mr. Wordsworth, a crawling insect, an ugly,
[03:08:21.820 --> 03:08:25.580]  misformed little creature who has no purpose here, no meaning.
[03:08:25.580 --> 03:08:27.260]  I am a human being.
[03:08:27.260 --> 03:08:34.860]  Words, Mr. Wordsworth, that have no substance and no dimension, like air, like a wind.
[03:08:34.860 --> 03:08:41.900]  I don't care. I tell you I don't care. I'm a human being. I exist. And if I speak one for a loud,
[03:08:42.620 --> 03:08:46.460]  that thought lives even after I'm shoveled into my grave.
[03:08:46.460 --> 03:08:49.580]  Illusions, Mr. Wordsworth.
[03:08:49.580 --> 03:08:55.100]  Illusions that you inject into your veins to make you think you have a strength,
[03:08:55.100 --> 03:09:00.140]  but you have no strength at all. You have nothing but spindly limbs and a dream,
[03:09:00.140 --> 03:09:02.700]  and the state has no use for your kind.
[03:09:04.300 --> 03:09:10.140]  Resistance to tyrants is obedience to God. It's Alex Jones.
[03:09:10.140 --> 03:09:16.300]  Now, well into overdrive as we saddlecast over 170 AM and FM affiliates across the United States,
[03:09:16.940 --> 03:09:22.060]  and of course go out of the internet at infowars.com, the free podcast and so much more.
[03:09:22.620 --> 03:09:26.540]  And you, the viewer, the listener, you have the power to reach more people by telling them
[03:09:26.540 --> 03:09:30.700]  about infowars.com, everything we do. And then we're a platform to try to tell folks about
[03:09:30.700 --> 03:09:34.860]  other groups and organizations and platforms. Everybody out there should go start your own
[03:09:34.860 --> 03:09:40.860]  LiveLeak.com platform. And then doppelganger videos, put them over on YouTube and somewhere else.
[03:09:40.860 --> 03:09:45.580]  Just, just reach out, communicate. That doesn't mean you have all the answers. I don't either.
[03:09:46.220 --> 03:09:51.820]  I don't care what color you are, you're a man or a woman, or Caitlyn Jenner, Bruce Jenner, whatever.
[03:09:52.700 --> 03:09:58.540]  Hayden Hewitt, LiveLeak.com co-founders, our guests for the rest of this 12-minute segment,
[03:09:58.540 --> 03:10:03.660]  but CJ in the control room, who I always encourage the guys to rant on air when they want to say
[03:10:03.660 --> 03:10:07.820]  something, not just tell me during the break, but I guess they don't want to seem uppity.
[03:10:07.820 --> 03:10:12.140]  He was, he really crystallized it. He said, look, it's not about hormones. It's not about
[03:10:12.140 --> 03:10:17.660]  agendas. It's not about, it's about money. And he really boiled it down to about a 60-second rant
[03:10:18.540 --> 03:10:23.820]  during a break. So go ahead, CJ. I'll try to paraphrase what I said without paraphrasing
[03:10:23.820 --> 03:10:26.620]  too much, but- And then cut out the cuss words, but just go ahead.
[03:10:27.500 --> 03:10:31.580]  Nothing too bad. But we know that there's only a shred of, or a handful of companies that own
[03:10:31.580 --> 03:10:39.180]  all media organizations, Viacom, Disney, Newscore. I can go through a list. It's not very big.
[03:10:39.180 --> 03:10:46.140]  There's five of them. Yeah. So Bruce is on E. He's Chris's husband, basically. He's,
[03:10:46.140 --> 03:10:50.860]  wasn't Olympian, but he's not in the news. It's not like the tabloids have Bruce over the place.
[03:10:50.860 --> 03:10:59.340]  They've got Kim and Jay-Z and tons of ad revenue based on them. And it turns out Bruce could get
[03:10:59.340 --> 03:11:05.420]  10 grand speaking engagement. But now that he's Caitlyn, he's getting upwards of 100 grand.
[03:11:05.980 --> 03:11:13.980]  And it's a small price to pay getting a boob job and a sex change, but he's gonna be making
[03:11:13.980 --> 03:11:19.980]  millions for himself and billions for that handful of corporations. While they sell this idea to
[03:11:19.980 --> 03:11:23.900]  everybody just to create more confusion and kind of you don't accept that you hate them.
[03:11:23.900 --> 03:11:28.300]  Well, yeah, you're a monster of bigot if you don't love Caitlyn and think she's
[03:11:28.300 --> 03:11:34.460]  the greatest gift to humanity since Kim. And then all over the country, they make you pay
[03:11:35.180 --> 03:11:39.500]  for people sex changes. You're going to see an explosion in this. And really,
[03:11:39.500 --> 03:11:45.980]  it's just a revolution of weirdness. It's nothing new. I was saying that Chas Bono,
[03:11:45.980 --> 03:11:54.860]  which was Sonny Bono and Chas' daughter or son became Chastity. I can't remember which way it was,
[03:11:54.860 --> 03:11:59.980]  but it happened almost a decade or more than a decade ago and it was no big deal.
[03:11:59.980 --> 03:12:04.380]  It wasn't like it was a great social event. Well, this really is an example of how the
[03:12:04.380 --> 03:12:09.260]  mainstream media doesn't have the influence it once had in news, but it's still there in
[03:12:09.260 --> 03:12:15.020]  entertainment. They still have the big numbers there and they can just create a new personality.
[03:12:15.740 --> 03:12:21.100]  I've seen this guy give interviews with this lady and it's just super boring. It's like watching
[03:12:21.100 --> 03:12:28.140]  paint dry and so they can just take this and then go, oh, how glamorous a goddess worship it.
[03:12:28.140 --> 03:12:33.580]  And it looks like a creepy narcissistic 60-year-old woman. I mean, I don't want to watch a creepy
[03:12:33.580 --> 03:12:38.940]  narcissistic. I mean, I don't sit around reading glamour magazines. It's just all of them. It's
[03:12:38.940 --> 03:12:43.660]  annoying. And it's the force feeding of this. Thank you, CJ. Anything else you want to add?
[03:12:44.540 --> 03:12:48.940]  Well, I was going to add one more point that you have these interviews with people like Dianne
[03:12:48.940 --> 03:12:55.180]  Sawyer or Oprah and we had the fallen Lance Armstrong because people looked up to him.
[03:12:55.180 --> 03:13:03.660]  And so when he had a failure, a major lie, it was devastating to the world. But Bruce is an
[03:13:04.540 --> 03:13:11.020]  athlete and nobody really looks up to him as an athlete anymore. But now they look at him like
[03:13:11.020 --> 03:13:18.380]  he's courageous and ESPN has given him a courage award. And there's a female basketball player.
[03:13:18.380 --> 03:13:23.420]  I can't remember her name, but she died of cancer and did all this work to raise awareness and money
[03:13:23.420 --> 03:13:29.420]  and was completely overlooked. And it's just sad that we live in a society that awards a
[03:13:30.620 --> 03:13:37.020]  some call mental illness, some call corporate gold digging with courage awards.
[03:13:37.020 --> 03:13:41.580]  Well, that's it. The angle to go here is this is corporate gold digging, geeking out.
[03:13:41.580 --> 03:13:49.260]  And it's just over the top. And it's part of this full on assault that's going on. And as our
[03:13:49.260 --> 03:13:56.620]  guest said, Hayden Hewitt, a co-founder of LiveLeak.com. This is really a distraction from the TPP
[03:13:57.340 --> 03:14:01.660]  and attacks on free speech. Thank you so much, CJ. Great points. All right, Hayden Hewitt,
[03:14:01.660 --> 03:14:04.940]  you're very polite. You keep pausing every 30 seconds to have me jump in, which I'll do.
[03:14:04.940 --> 03:14:09.500]  The last six, seven minutes we have, you have the floor rant about whatever you want. Tell us
[03:14:09.500 --> 03:14:14.460]  about shows you're involved. Tell us about LiveLeak.com. Tell us about how you secretly want to
[03:14:14.460 --> 03:14:19.100]  have a change into an Easter Bunny. I want to be changed into the cow that jumped over the moon.
[03:14:19.100 --> 03:14:25.100]  I'm courageous, pay for my change into a cow. Go ahead. I'm going to say this is all well and good,
[03:14:25.100 --> 03:14:27.900]  but as soon as I've just heard the figures involved, I've just got someone over there
[03:14:27.900 --> 03:14:32.780]  ordering me a dress on eBay right now because that's the money that goes around just for, you know,
[03:14:33.420 --> 03:14:37.180]  a gender reassignment. I might not go the full thing, but I'm sure, you know, for a few hundred
[03:14:37.180 --> 03:14:42.620]  thousand dollars. Exactly. I'm not going to chop my Johnson off, but I could start wearing a dress
[03:14:42.620 --> 03:14:47.900]  for a hundred thousand to speak engagement. I could have a new persona. I wouldn't pay a hundred
[03:14:47.900 --> 03:14:52.220]  thousand. I wouldn't pay a hundred thousand. I wouldn't pay a hundred thousand. No, I'm a king
[03:14:52.220 --> 03:14:59.580]  keyword. No, I get it. I'm actually doing it. I'm thinking about it. Oh, please. No, I thought about
[03:14:59.580 --> 03:15:03.740]  as a gag doing it, but I'm not going to do it. I literally chopped hers off and look how much
[03:15:03.740 --> 03:15:09.020]  she gets us. Yeah, I'm sorry. Yeah, it's I'm sorry. Go ahead, sir. I'll stall this way.
[03:15:09.020 --> 03:15:15.420]  Think about the dress sizes you can squeeze into now. Do you have exactly? You're not thinking
[03:15:15.420 --> 03:15:20.140]  you through. You've got to think it all the way through. Okay. Other stuff. Obviously,
[03:15:20.140 --> 03:15:27.980]  there's lively.com, which started out in 2006 at six o'clock in the morning. And that's when my whole
[03:15:27.980 --> 03:15:37.980]  life went crazy. It's been an amazing roller coaster. It's 100% independent. It shouldn't
[03:15:37.980 --> 03:15:43.660]  work. It shouldn't work, but it does. It does have rules, but it's none of those rules are based on
[03:15:45.100 --> 03:15:49.740]  opinions or beliefs or anything like that. In that respect, it's as free as it can be.
[03:15:50.300 --> 03:15:54.620]  We do have some rules on language because, as you know, running a cell yourself,
[03:15:54.620 --> 03:15:58.540]  if you allow certain things, you end up being a site that's just smothered in porn advertising
[03:15:58.540 --> 03:16:03.740]  and hate and nothing else. But lively is something I've just, I've been honored to be involved with
[03:16:03.740 --> 03:16:08.460]  for so long. So the things that we do, we're doing it. We did a lively show once a week. We're
[03:16:08.460 --> 03:16:15.500]  doing it this evening at 10, 30 p.m. for just one time. We do talk about some serious stuff. We
[03:16:15.500 --> 03:16:21.500]  will be talking about Christiane and some other things. It's the lively show, but it's definitely
[03:16:21.500 --> 03:16:27.420]  for 18 years and over. It is absolutely fault of the brim of the most disgusting language.
[03:16:29.020 --> 03:16:35.580]  Foul opinions, abuse, trolling from the members. We show some grotesque videos sometimes as well.
[03:16:35.580 --> 03:16:45.100]  So it's just a no-hold bar free for all? Yeah, it's disgusting. I am ashamed of myself.
[03:16:45.100 --> 03:16:55.660]  I understand. But it's a good shame. But we do that. Got the media company that's slowly but surely
[03:16:55.660 --> 03:17:00.700]  getting moving, where we're combining doing corporate media and creative media and supporting
[03:17:00.700 --> 03:17:06.380]  people who are passionate about their topic and want to get it out of there. And just, I honestly
[03:17:06.380 --> 03:17:11.500]  believe that if more people who are capable, and there are lots of us around the world,
[03:17:11.500 --> 03:17:18.060]  nothing special, genuinely, that's not fake pride or anything like that. It's true. If everyone
[03:17:18.060 --> 03:17:23.180]  that had these resources devoted just a little bit of their time, a little bit of their energy,
[03:17:23.180 --> 03:17:30.140]  be it the filming side, the uploading side, the graphic side, imagine what a group of thousands
[03:17:30.140 --> 03:17:36.140]  could do for pretty much no investment on a personal basis. I'm not trying to sell anything here.
[03:17:36.140 --> 03:17:40.140]  And by the way, you mean outside the cookie cutter? It doesn't mean we all agree. It's that we're not
[03:17:40.140 --> 03:17:46.380]  doing the five company brainwash dance. We're doing true organic human activity. Could you imagine
[03:17:46.380 --> 03:17:51.820]  if the big movies and shakes and alternative news put their heads together on a project and invited
[03:17:51.820 --> 03:17:58.460]  10,000 citizen journalists to do the same? I want to do that. What corporate media could stand up to
[03:17:58.460 --> 03:18:05.500]  that? In truth, totally decentralized, totally on top. So this is something in my own very small,
[03:18:05.500 --> 03:18:11.260]  and it is a very small way, but it's something I'm striving towards being a part of. If I can only
[03:18:11.260 --> 03:18:16.620]  influence two other people to try it, well, they can go and influence two people each to try it,
[03:18:16.620 --> 03:18:21.340]  and we'll actually have a cool pyramid scheme. Sure. Well, your sites reach billions, you know,
[03:18:21.340 --> 03:18:26.060]  just on YouTube, we've reached billions and then other platforms. I mean, look, I'm nothing that
[03:18:26.060 --> 03:18:30.620]  special at the end of the day, except that I have the will to take action. I've had a huge effect,
[03:18:30.620 --> 03:18:34.780]  and I get what you're saying. You've seen the effect you've had. There's the thrill of seeing
[03:18:34.780 --> 03:18:40.460]  other fellow humans do amazing trailblazing things, innovation. You're saying, folks, get off the bench,
[03:18:40.460 --> 03:18:46.220]  successful people, especially, get involved in the culture war. Yeah, I mean, one of the things
[03:18:46.220 --> 03:18:50.380]  like that, I'm sure Richie, when we're talking, because it's an open business model that we started,
[03:18:50.940 --> 03:18:56.220]  what we do to protect everyone is my company and the people we work with form a new company
[03:18:56.220 --> 03:19:01.580]  where everyone's partners. So as they push it and strive and push that vehicle,
[03:19:01.580 --> 03:19:06.780]  a media vehicle forward, and it does earn some money, they get the chunk of it. And it's this
[03:19:06.780 --> 03:19:15.180]  openness and fairness that we could do without the corporates of horrible, slimy, screw everyone
[03:19:15.180 --> 03:19:19.660]  atmosphere. You don't screw the little man and screw the talent. The predatory beish.
[03:19:20.460 --> 03:19:24.780]  It doesn't have to be that way. It's not, I know it sounds kind of hippie. No, it's a win-win. That's
[03:19:24.780 --> 03:19:31.180]  how, that's my entire philosophy. I won't do somebody wrong, even if they're doing bad to me
[03:19:31.180 --> 03:19:36.620]  unless I absolutely have to do it to survive. And I treat everybody like I want to be treated.
[03:19:36.620 --> 03:19:41.900]  It's the golden rule. And that's what made civilization. This predatory globalist model
[03:19:41.900 --> 03:19:47.100]  is going out. I mean, right as it crests, it's coming to its end. HaydenHewittLiveLeak.com.
[03:19:47.100 --> 03:19:50.540]  Thank you so much for the time. I look forward to having you back on soon. And I hope we can
[03:19:51.100 --> 03:19:54.780]  get on the phone sometime and talk about working together. And I appreciate your support with
[03:19:54.780 --> 03:19:59.500]  our channels on LiveLeak, sir. No problem, sir. It's been my pleasure and I'll speak to you soon.
[03:19:59.500 --> 03:20:02.300]  Great job.
