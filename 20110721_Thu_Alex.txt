[00:00.000 --> 00:11.680]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well
[00:11.680 --> 00:19.240]  so does he he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin
[00:19.240 --> 00:37.880]  Texas Alex Jones we are live it is Thursday the 21st day of July 2011
[00:37.880 --> 00:42.080]  we're gonna be here live for at least the next three hours we have a couple of
[00:42.080 --> 00:46.960]  well-known comedians one of them of course frequent guests on national
[00:46.960 --> 00:52.920]  television programs joining us who are Obama supporters coming up in the third
[00:52.920 --> 00:58.760]  hour so I'm going to have an interesting discussion with both of them here on air
[00:58.760 --> 01:03.320]  and ask them some common-sense questions it should be a quite informative
[01:03.320 --> 01:07.520]  we'll see how it goes with Hal Sparks and Richard Hunter I've been a frequent
[01:07.520 --> 01:12.120]  guest on Richard Hunter's Dallas television excuse me radio broadcast
[01:12.120 --> 01:18.200]  okay that said I feel like I should have bells and whistles going off or like the
[01:18.200 --> 01:23.680]  drudge report a big red siren going for this news that is coming up and this
[01:23.680 --> 01:32.640]  news is so big that I cannot just start the broadcast with it I have to build it
[01:32.640 --> 01:36.000]  up because I've noticed over the years that if I come out with a bombshell
[01:36.000 --> 01:41.040]  info and just blurt it out upfront that it doesn't get the attention in the
[01:41.040 --> 01:48.720]  traction it deserves this latest Homeland Security activity should be as
[01:48.720 --> 01:53.400]  big as the Mayak and Homeland Security reports that law enforcement now sent us
[01:53.400 --> 01:58.960]  two years ago where they admit that 90 plus percent of their training and
[01:58.960 --> 02:02.560]  preparation is for gun owners conservatives returning veterans of
[02:02.560 --> 02:06.920]  white people Ron Paul supporters people that want to get us out of the UN and in
[02:06.920 --> 02:13.160]  the Fed this new video is in an article Paul Watson has written DHS video
[02:13.160 --> 02:18.640]  characterizes white Americans as most likely terrorist big-sist fear campaign
[02:18.640 --> 02:22.520]  continues but Americans are just as likely to be killed by peanut allergies
[02:22.520 --> 02:26.840]  and they are in a terrorist attack and that's even averaging the deaths of 9
[02:26.840 --> 02:30.600]  11 in to the equation in the last 10 years we're gonna be going over this and
[02:30.600 --> 02:34.480]  playing much of the nine-minute propaganda video of the see something
[02:34.480 --> 02:38.240]  say something campaign they're putting on television and on telescreens at
[02:38.240 --> 02:42.600]  Walmart's Mall of America and other places where people congregate the
[02:42.600 --> 02:51.160]  modern town squares the modern Commons this is off the charts it shows people's
[02:51.160 --> 02:55.480]  blue eyes and zooms in on them and animates the blue eyes flashing over and
[02:55.480 --> 03:00.120]  over again and has black people and other minorities reporting on the whites I
[03:00.120 --> 03:06.560]  mean it is a hundred percent designed to shift see see first they sell you on
[03:06.560 --> 03:10.960]  tyranny that it's only for a group that's overall unpopular quote Muslims
[03:10.960 --> 03:16.400]  Muslim extremist and Hitler did that with the Jews and then once that's in
[03:16.400 --> 03:20.280]  place and the police states in place in the name of going after them communist
[03:20.280 --> 03:24.200]  stuff like that then it's always shifted against the main target and that's the
[03:24.200 --> 03:28.680]  general public and whites of course on average are the most wealthy and are
[03:28.680 --> 03:34.040]  still though not for long the majority and aging population and it just flashes
[03:34.040 --> 03:37.320]  white person after white person and says they're going to get you they're
[03:37.320 --> 03:41.440]  coming and it shows the minorities scrambling calling homeland security
[03:41.440 --> 03:46.760]  who then sends the good white police to stop evil whitey so it's a classic
[03:46.760 --> 03:52.200]  divide and conquer so first they sell the good old boys on hey we're taking
[03:52.200 --> 03:55.000]  everybody's rights and naked body scanning and looking at your bank
[03:55.000 --> 03:59.800]  account and tapping your phone to get the evil Arabs and Muslims quote evil
[03:59.800 --> 04:04.320]  Arabs and Muslims and then the entire time it was always about landowners
[04:04.320 --> 04:09.400]  gun owners pro-lifers and and so now they're publicly rolling out we've been
[04:09.400 --> 04:14.800]  telling you for a decade was going to be white Al Qaeda or approaching a decade
[04:14.800 --> 04:18.160]  in September that it would then be flipped because we have the internal
[04:18.160 --> 04:21.360]  documents said to us by police over the years that would then be flipped once the
[04:21.360 --> 04:25.240]  grip is in place and say look white people if they got blue eyes and it shows
[04:25.240 --> 04:31.320]  the blue eyes animated and flashing and burning in Muslim headdress that white
[04:31.320 --> 04:35.800]  Al Qaeda is everywhere and the white people are with bin Laden and those that
[04:35.800 --> 04:38.560]  want to get out of the UN are with bin Laden and those that don't want to raise
[04:38.560 --> 04:42.440]  the debt ceiling are with bin Laden and those that don't like Obama are with
[04:42.440 --> 04:46.640]  bin Laden and they're just they're everywhere white people they're
[04:46.640 --> 04:50.040]  they're incredibly evil they're incredibly dangerous they're incredibly
[04:50.040 --> 04:53.560]  horrible and they've got to be stopped immediately we're gonna get into that

[16:34.920 --> 16:39.680]  this is good al-qaeda and it's peace when when our rebels attack and then if
[16:39.680 --> 16:44.440]  they're losing then the NATO in the US start bombing it's not war it's
[16:44.440 --> 16:50.120]  kinetic action it's peace so I'm gonna get into all of that continuing here
[16:50.120 --> 16:56.560]  with other economic moves the stack is thick I'll get to more of that later now
[16:56.560 --> 17:02.680]  remember coming up at 33 after the big story they've got ads that DHS ads that
[17:02.680 --> 17:06.040]  show black people and Hispanics and others seeing white people all the
[17:06.040 --> 17:11.600]  terrorists are white it zooms in on big blue eyes animated glowing like like
[17:11.600 --> 17:15.840]  glacial ice and it's just the whites are everywhere the whites are everywhere
[17:15.840 --> 17:20.400]  they're gonna get you you know the the the the white al-qaeda see first they
[17:20.400 --> 17:23.760]  tell the good old boys we're gonna take all the rights away the brown people the
[17:23.760 --> 17:27.440]  good old boys are like good get them brown people kill them glass parking lot
[17:27.440 --> 17:30.600]  them we get all the internal documents it's all about gun owners conservatives
[17:30.600 --> 17:35.440]  returning veterans then after they've got the stuff in place they flip it and
[17:35.440 --> 17:38.480]  say it's white people they're everywhere and that's already in the
[17:38.480 --> 17:47.400]  internal police training manuals but that's coming up at 33 after okay
[17:47.400 --> 17:57.160]  continuing with economic news euro reaches 11th hour as Angela Merkel and
[17:57.160 --> 18:06.000]  Nicholas Sarkozy hold crisis talks and you notice how this works Europe has
[18:06.000 --> 18:10.720]  now had three bailouts of the banks the last three years the United States has
[18:10.720 --> 18:15.680]  had an open window of just perpetual quote bailouts 70 plus percent of the
[18:15.680 --> 18:20.240]  money we now know going to foreign banks and families and individuals Roth
[18:20.240 --> 18:25.240]  Childs Rockefellers their foreign subsidiaries tax-free while their own
[18:25.240 --> 18:29.480]  media groups promote fixing things by raising taxes on the rich they mean your
[18:29.480 --> 18:32.560]  neighbor that lives in a bigger house than you they are exempt the ultra rich
[18:32.560 --> 18:36.680]  are exempt they sick the giant welfare dependent class on what's left for the
[18:36.680 --> 18:39.960]  middle class then everyone's poor and there's no way to escape the bondage
[18:39.960 --> 18:43.920]  and then the government jobs or contracts are all you can get because
[18:43.920 --> 18:46.720]  you're post-industrial and your economy's been destroyed and you're
[18:46.720 --> 18:52.680]  totally dependent it's a sharecropper neo-futalistic fascistic system every
[18:52.680 --> 18:56.000]  one of those words means something when I say a sharecropper economy look up what
[18:56.000 --> 19:00.360]  that means where you're dependent where you're worse than a slave because slave
[19:00.360 --> 19:04.640]  owners if you study the Caribbean you study North America and the colonies
[19:04.640 --> 19:10.680]  then after and slavery predominantly blacks if you study slavery you very
[19:10.680 --> 19:15.320]  very quickly learn that the slaves the black slaves had horrible but the white
[19:15.320 --> 19:21.480]  indentured servants Irish and others you know they were the first waves of
[19:21.480 --> 19:27.280]  quote poor Europeans most of you have ancestors that were indentured servants
[19:27.280 --> 19:33.800]  you would sign a five seven or ten-year contract and you would come here but then
[19:33.800 --> 19:36.280]  they would make you pay for your eminboard and other things and most
[19:36.280 --> 19:40.880]  people never got off the plantation and then if you didn't if you tried to run
[19:40.880 --> 19:45.880]  they would actually put you in torture stocks they would lock your arms and head
[19:45.880 --> 19:51.040]  up in a torture position many times till you died or lock you up in a cage yeah
[19:51.040 --> 19:55.320]  it was only the Constitution got rid of that cruel and unusual punishment and
[19:55.320 --> 20:00.360]  that's what people aren't don't understand and the sharecropper owners

[24:00.480 --> 24:22.400]  so my point on sharecropping is and this was written in mainline histories at
[24:22.400 --> 24:29.880]  the time that the white sharecroppers a lot of times would starve to death and
[24:29.880 --> 24:33.720]  the way it would be put down in the books by the sharecropper owner would be
[24:33.720 --> 24:36.600]  oh they you know they died of sickness because you would get malnourished and
[24:36.600 --> 24:39.720]  then die of a normal cold that wouldn't kill somebody was getting enough
[24:39.720 --> 24:44.840]  nourishment and because you didn't need to take care of them and you would have
[24:44.840 --> 24:49.800]  to buy your products from the company store under the contract if you wanted
[24:49.800 --> 24:53.680]  a shirt or a dress for your daughter and then your children would grow up
[24:53.680 --> 24:58.760]  slaves of the sharecropper system now when blacks got a man's supace and
[24:58.760 --> 25:05.520]  proclamation they then became sharecroppers most of them and then a
[25:05.520 --> 25:09.040]  lot of black folks ran to the north and other areas where they found just as
[25:09.040 --> 25:15.080]  much tribalism racism whatever you want to call it competing for resources and
[25:15.080 --> 25:18.800]  then tried to form their own communities just so they could have that's what
[25:18.800 --> 25:21.320]  folks tend to put themselves in their own community just so they could have
[25:21.320 --> 25:27.920]  some type of economic ecosystem to buy sell and trade with each other and I'm
[25:27.920 --> 25:33.160]  not saying that segregation was good the point is is that then they wanted to get
[25:33.160 --> 25:36.520]  rid of the thriving wealthy black communities that have developed with
[25:36.520 --> 25:39.840]  their own economies their own banks their own grocery stores their own
[25:39.840 --> 25:44.280]  churches and so the great society came in as a way to have the state come in
[25:44.280 --> 25:50.560]  poses liberals bring in money to pay the women not to have men in the house so
[25:50.560 --> 25:54.400]  that the society would break down so the narcotics could be brought in so then
[25:54.400 --> 25:58.960]  the young black males could be put in prison which were colleges for crime and
[25:58.960 --> 26:03.200]  now that same model is being duplicated out to everyone so that's why they want
[26:03.200 --> 26:07.640]  to destroy the middle class and make us modern sharecroppers where we all either
[26:07.640 --> 26:12.320]  get government contracts for business or on some type of assistance or welfare or
[26:12.320 --> 26:17.120]  they take part of your paycheck for life steal the money and then hyperinflate
[26:17.120 --> 26:22.680]  the currency and steal the value of your social security and your pensions
[26:22.680 --> 26:26.800]  whether they're public or private this is how the globalist operate they do
[26:26.800 --> 26:33.080]  not want you to be independent and sure enough third round ended a few months
[26:33.080 --> 26:37.200]  ago of trillions of dollars of European taxpayer money being pumped into private
[26:37.200 --> 26:41.160]  banks and private families and so just as soon as they got hundreds of
[26:41.160 --> 26:45.720]  millions more in the grease bailout now they're back for more and the contagion
[26:45.720 --> 26:50.160]  is spreading oops now more countries need to be bailed out but it's not really
[26:50.160 --> 26:53.080]  countries they always want to put the blame on the people it's not Italy it's
[26:53.080 --> 26:57.640]  not Portugal their government traders signed on to the derivatives so the
[26:57.640 --> 27:01.320]  government investments now have been devalued and so the bankers that sold
[27:01.320 --> 27:05.560]  in the fraudulent instruments don't go to jail they get trillions more to prop
[27:05.560 --> 27:12.240]  up those very instruments euro reaches 11th hour deal as Angela Merkel and
[27:12.240 --> 27:16.000]  Nicholas R. Cozy hold crisis talks so they're they're trying to reach this
[27:16.000 --> 27:20.280]  11th hour deal they haven't reached it yet and it continues early on Thursday
[27:20.280 --> 27:23.480]  morning after seven hours of talks Germany and France reached a common
[27:23.480 --> 27:26.960]  position on a second bailout of Greece so somewhat of a deal but not
[27:26.960 --> 27:30.760]  completely but details of that accord were not revealed you can't let the
[27:30.760 --> 27:34.680]  slaves know what's going on the German chancellor and French president have
[27:34.680 --> 27:39.960]  been barrage with pleas from political and financial leaders to reach an
[27:39.960 --> 27:43.080]  agreement or risk the collapse of the single currency and then they'll give
[27:43.080 --> 27:47.480]  them trillions more of taxpayer money to the bankers and then you go into more
[27:47.480 --> 27:51.120]  debt to prop them up and then a month from now for this new deal they'll say
[27:51.120 --> 27:54.440]  now we need trillions more or things will collapse and then trillions more
[27:54.440 --> 27:57.680]  will be given and they'll say now we need trillions more we'd raise your taxes
[27:57.680 --> 28:01.240]  more and cut more services or things will collapse and then more will be
[28:01.240 --> 28:04.880]  given same thing here in the US and on and on and on and on and on forever just
[28:04.880 --> 28:09.120]  like a third-world country just like Nigeria just like Brazil just like
[28:09.120 --> 28:14.320]  Argentina Argentina more wealthy 80 years ago per capita than any other
[28:14.320 --> 28:18.360]  country in the world except for Switzerland the saying was as rich as an
[28:18.360 --> 28:25.440]  Argentine or an Argentine not anymore Ted Anderson was down there on a last
[28:25.440 --> 28:29.800]  year and he said it was hellish and he said you see families not drunken
[28:29.800 --> 28:33.480]  homeless people but good-looking families living in doorways with their
[28:33.480 --> 28:38.400]  children everywhere police stomping around a once wealthy nation that signed
[28:38.400 --> 28:45.240]  on to the banker system destroyed I'll never forget that article in 2000 2001
[28:45.240 --> 28:48.720]  the Washington Post the Washington Post reporter witnessed it an 18 wheeler
[28:48.720 --> 28:54.720]  carrying black Angus beef premium beef turned over two weeks into the total
[28:54.720 --> 28:59.240]  collapse and there were families it described like Robinson Caruso in
[28:59.240 --> 29:04.480]  their suits but with torn torn jackets and in holes in them with dirt all over
[29:04.480 --> 29:10.840]  their faces running up with knives and cutting off giant bloblets of beef and
[29:10.840 --> 29:13.960]  gobbling it with their children with blood all over them you can pull that
[29:13.960 --> 29:20.000]  article up just just like piranhas just like tearing into the meat because they
[29:20.000 --> 29:23.560]  hyperinflated their currency they shut down all the infrastructure when they
[29:23.560 --> 29:27.160]  quote defaulted and so we're just being maneuvered into the inevitable default
[29:27.160 --> 29:30.840]  they're just getting as deeper threatening default now as they as they
[29:30.840 --> 29:35.200]  get as deeper down the rat hole Germany France break Euro bailout deadlock
[29:35.200 --> 29:41.000]  yes yes Rupert Murdoch's Fox News ran black op department former executive
[29:41.000 --> 29:44.440]  claims they'll end up dead that's how the London Telegraph look for that
[29:44.440 --> 29:51.200]  executive to commit suicide real quick we'll be right back stay with us we're
[29:51.200 --> 29:59.480]  on the March the Empire's on the run Alex Jones and the GCN radio network

[30:03.680 --> 30:08.000]  solar power generator number one new climate legislation could easily double
[30:08.000 --> 30:12.160]  or triple your electric bill number two our new energies are wants to control
[30:12.160 --> 30:16.200]  how much power your electric company allows you to have it's true total
[30:16.200 --> 30:20.080]  government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is
[30:20.080 --> 30:24.320]  coming number three in some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously
[30:24.320 --> 30:28.520]  overloaded and now new socialist legislation is only compounding the
[30:28.520 --> 30:32.840]  problem number four dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids every
[30:32.840 --> 30:36.560]  year thousands of families lose their power from weather related onages number

[36:56.760 --> 37:03.000]  moment because I will tend to spin out and my rpms will go up too high and I
[37:03.000 --> 37:11.400]  won't calmly go over every aspect of this next report DHS video characterizes
[37:11.400 --> 37:18.160]  white Americans as most likely terrorist and I shot a video breaking down the
[37:18.160 --> 37:24.760]  different facets of this this morning big sis tries to turn minorities against
[37:24.760 --> 37:32.600]  whites by labeling whites terrorist that report is up on info wars comm as well
[37:32.600 --> 37:37.080]  our main report DHS video characterizes white Americans as most likely
[37:37.080 --> 37:41.680]  terrorist is on the right hand side of drudge second story down was top story
[37:41.680 --> 37:46.880]  earlier red linked I'm glad Matt drudge of drudge report dot com recognizes what
[37:46.880 --> 37:53.000]  is big news big sis tries to turn minorities against whites by labeling
[37:53.000 --> 37:56.880]  them terrorist I wrote this little blurb this morning Watson's article is
[37:56.880 --> 38:01.080]  more detailed see something say something TV ads sell the false idea that
[38:01.080 --> 38:05.760]  white terrorist are hiding under every rock and only big brother can keep
[38:05.760 --> 38:10.360]  minorities safe from the vicious wicked white killers for nine years this has
[38:10.360 --> 38:13.800]  been taught to police behind closed doors we have the training manuals the
[38:13.800 --> 38:18.840]  training videos sent us by good police that's how we know that now they are
[38:18.840 --> 38:21.720]  rolling it out in public as we told you they would they would announce white
[38:21.720 --> 38:26.600]  al-qaeda is coming to get you the propagandas sell in the past sold good
[38:26.600 --> 38:32.520]  old boys on the police state to keep us safe from al-ciyeda they then turn it
[38:32.520 --> 38:37.960]  around on the whole public we're gonna go to that video in a little while some
[38:37.960 --> 38:45.760]  whites are racist against minorities so the federal takeover is sold in the
[38:45.760 --> 38:51.560]  name of getting the evil brown people then the social engineers flip it until
[38:51.560 --> 38:58.280]  the races that happen to have dark skin it is the whites to look out for total
[38:58.280 --> 39:07.360]  divide and conquer is the outcome every one is bad but the real terrorists that
[39:07.360 --> 39:12.760]  actually stage the attacks our loving protectors the feds so so we're being
[39:12.760 --> 39:23.280]  told we're gonna go to that video again a little bit later we are we are told
[39:23.280 --> 39:31.680]  that that the government is here to keep us safe we are told that they're doing
[39:31.680 --> 39:36.440]  everything they can to stop al-qaeda from striking you at any minute and then we
[39:36.440 --> 39:40.760]  learn on record that the US government was protecting the hijackers that's even
[39:40.760 --> 39:44.680]  senator Graham one of the 9-11 commissioners and five others six of the
[39:44.680 --> 39:48.680]  ten have said that we played to the MSNBC clip last week we learned the
[39:48.680 --> 39:53.800]  underwear bomber Christmas Day year and a half ago was gotten on the plane by a
[39:53.800 --> 39:57.640]  US government agent the State Department had to admit that they were ordered to
[39:57.640 --> 40:03.040]  help get him on the plane in Amsterdam and that without a passport the US gave
[40:03.040 --> 40:07.360]  him a visa so the drugged out person could pop a firecracker on his pants and
[40:07.360 --> 40:12.240]  now we've all got except body scanners not only is this a domestic police state
[40:12.240 --> 40:16.840]  crackdown politically it also scares us into getting behind all these illegal
[40:16.840 --> 40:20.440]  wars in the name of rooting out the people that attacked us and also these
[40:20.440 --> 40:26.840]  big defense contractors make in the last decade more than two trillion dollars in
[40:26.840 --> 40:32.120]  domestic spying over a million contractors spying control grids face
[40:32.120 --> 40:36.240]  scanning cameras license plate reading cameras naked body scanners data mining
[40:36.240 --> 40:39.720]  I'm gonna get into some of that news coming up that integrates with this this
[40:39.720 --> 40:44.880]  is a total takeover and it's very simple it's a false flag Hitler firebombs the
[40:44.880 --> 40:48.960]  Reichstag to declare a police state in Germany Hitler blows up his own
[40:48.960 --> 40:53.320]  military base in Gliwitz to blame on the polls who wants World War two the Zars
[40:53.320 --> 40:56.640]  did it in Russia the Soviets did it the British have been caught doing it over
[40:56.640 --> 41:01.720]  and over again mainline British had lines you know MI6 running the IRA
[41:01.720 --> 41:05.880]  staging bombings as a pretext to clamp down on the Irish as an excuse to
[41:05.880 --> 41:10.000]  continue to keep troops there I mean this is the oldest trick in the book
[41:10.000 --> 41:14.840]  Obama ships tens of thousands of guns into Mexico to cause a crime wave to
[41:14.840 --> 41:17.760]  then blame it on the Second Amendment and even when he gets caught he's still
[41:17.760 --> 41:23.240]  using it outside of law and outside of courts to go in I was talking to one of
[41:23.240 --> 41:27.120]  my friends the other day who had who bought two semi-automatic rifles because
[41:27.120 --> 41:31.480]  they were on sale I've done that before and it's a great by the way
[41:31.480 --> 41:34.120]  investment all my guns have gone up in price that I bought you know 15 years
[41:34.120 --> 41:39.160]  ago and he got an ATF FBI visit at his house no criminal record it's creating
[41:39.160 --> 41:43.240]  the idea that you're evil and the ATF orders gun shops to do things that
[41:43.240 --> 41:47.320]  aren't even the law that's what tyranny is that's what martial law is that's
[41:47.320 --> 41:51.600]  what dictatorship is well I don't care if the federal guy if the house won't
[41:51.600 --> 41:55.880]  pass a law that we can put carbon taxes on coal power plants I'm Obama I'm just
[41:55.880 --> 42:01.560]  gonna do it by the way my friends are exempt if this is absolute criminal
[42:01.560 --> 42:08.520]  takeover I mean realize that but I digress and I won't have time to play
[42:08.520 --> 42:12.000]  the whole nine-minute video it is it is propaganda that is unspeakable I'm
[42:12.000 --> 42:14.720]  gonna probably shoot a special report in the next few days where I just take
[42:14.720 --> 42:21.520]  excise pieces of this and you know really in a well-documented slick way show
[42:21.520 --> 42:24.200]  people what's happening instead of just up here talking about it because words
[42:24.200 --> 42:30.040]  cannot describe how wicked and duplicitous this is so what did Hitler do
[42:30.040 --> 42:36.560]  first he goes after unpopular groups in Germany Jews Gypsies Communist and he
[42:36.560 --> 42:41.440]  takes their rights away in law and people get behind it yeah get them then
[42:41.440 --> 42:47.520]  he's swung it around against Christians against Protestants against
[42:47.520 --> 42:51.720]  Seventh-day Adventist again you name it against his competition in business
[42:51.720 --> 42:56.680]  even fellow Nazis they would rob their companies and send them off to get to a
[42:56.680 --> 43:03.600]  death camp this is what they did a lot of the French that helped the Nazis
[43:03.600 --> 43:10.320]  take over France they got turned against a lot of the VG did so that's how this
[43:10.320 --> 43:14.600]  works you first set something up with an unpopular group and whether it's a good
[43:14.600 --> 43:19.240]  thing to make Muslims and Arabs unpopular or not and obviously it's
[43:19.240 --> 43:23.840]  discrimination and stereotypical and wrong it was acceptable to say these
[43:23.840 --> 43:31.320]  people are devils and newcom to call them horrible pejoratives you know camel
[43:31.320 --> 43:38.520]  bleepers rag you know bleepers sand inwards that's all cute and funny on
[43:38.520 --> 43:42.680]  talk radio well I don't think it is because even if you think Muslims are
[43:42.680 --> 43:47.000]  evil and bad want to get you at the end of the day this was being beta tested on
[43:47.000 --> 43:51.920]  them to then be used against everybody else and I told you from the FBI
[43:51.920 --> 43:56.800]  federal marshal state police in California Missouri state police in
[43:56.800 --> 44:01.920]  Florida Texas federal marshal sending me slat training the videos we've shown
[44:01.920 --> 44:07.960]  them here we've done special reports on it where they say who are the number one
[44:07.960 --> 44:14.520]  terrorist gun owners that returning veterans libertarians in the Fedders
[44:14.520 --> 44:18.200]  Ron Paul supporters I mean I have the training manuals here the Homeland
[44:18.200 --> 44:22.360]  Security the Mayak reports remember this being a national news two years ago
[44:22.360 --> 44:29.360]  remember all this now I told you they've taken over the Middle East they've
[44:29.360 --> 44:32.960]  invaded all the countries they are now are flipping over to work with Al Qaeda
[44:32.960 --> 44:36.440]  to overthrow Qaddafi the Muslim Brotherhood to overthrow Mubarak they're
[44:36.440 --> 44:40.200]  now shifting to a new face they're gonna keep the Muslim demonization going but
[44:40.200 --> 44:43.720]  it's now a dish that's cooked they just put on the back burner to keep it warm
[44:43.720 --> 44:49.200]  and and and you know they've killed bin Laden in their staged event they're
[44:49.200 --> 44:53.360]  now moving on to the next phase to okay we don't have a bill of rights we spy
[44:53.360 --> 44:56.980]  on you you have no rights we can secretly arrest citizens out of the
[44:56.980 --> 45:00.560]  John Warren Defense Authorization Act Enemy Commissions Act we can fly you to
[45:00.560 --> 45:05.640]  places to be tortured we can secretly execute you Obama's continuing it now
[45:05.640 --> 45:09.360]  the next phase that they've already been beta testing behind closed doors with
[45:09.360 --> 45:14.760]  the police and military now they're moving it to white Al Qaeda and in this
[45:14.760 --> 45:18.160]  video they cut in every one of them were mentally ill pats he's just been
[45:18.160 --> 45:22.800]  confirmed even mainstream news admits jihad jay and others blue eyes animating
[45:22.800 --> 45:28.560]  the blue eyes in the video to glow look blue blue they're Al Qaeda and it shows
[45:28.560 --> 45:32.240]  at the beginning of this Homeland Security nine minute video a shot of
[45:32.240 --> 45:42.560]  family of thinking about all that's good in America nostalgia on top of the
[45:42.560 --> 45:47.840]  piano and 90 plus percent of the photos of the American family it's Hispanics
[45:47.840 --> 45:51.840]  it's Asians it's black people you see it instantly and there's one white guy
[45:51.840 --> 45:56.600]  but he's blurred in the background so it's like this is America and we are
[45:56.600 --> 46:01.680]  many people and then it cuts to a black guy he's professional he's good in his
[46:01.680 --> 46:05.080]  suit he's no longer being the stereotypically put down by the same
[46:05.080 --> 46:08.760]  media same government as a gangbanger he's going out in the parking garage
[46:08.760 --> 46:12.480]  and he sees evil white guys getting ready to blow up the building and he
[46:12.480 --> 46:17.640]  calls it in on him and then the good white guys the only good white guys in
[46:17.640 --> 46:22.800]  the whole thing FBI show up and they stopped the out the the white Al Qaeda
[46:22.800 --> 46:25.560]  that's just everywhere they're creating this false perception ahead of the
[46:25.560 --> 46:29.680]  private contractors that run the government staging more a terror to take
[46:29.680 --> 46:33.520]  over society even more so you won't be mad about going into austerity we're
[46:33.520 --> 46:36.840]  having your social security taken or everything imploding and all the money
[46:36.840 --> 46:41.800]  going to the offshore banks no no no and and then it just cuts to white Al
[46:41.800 --> 46:44.880]  Qaeda white Al Qaeda blue-eyed women they're gonna get you and then they
[46:44.880 --> 46:48.640]  mix in McVay of course that was a staged event they mix in all of this white
[46:48.640 --> 46:55.360]  white white white white white and it goes on and on and on and on now remember
[46:55.360 --> 47:00.480]  I've told you for nine years white Al Qaeda I even said they're gonna call it
[47:00.480 --> 47:04.400]  white Al Qaeda I know them I studied them I'm like a criminologist following a
[47:04.400 --> 47:09.760]  serial killer for decades I know their next move I'm on record and it may even
[47:09.760 --> 47:13.360]  be they just grabbed the terms I come up with like I told you about propaganda
[47:13.360 --> 47:22.480]  placement and message placement and and and and and police state placement now
[47:22.480 --> 47:25.720]  they even use those terms I don't know if it's chicken or the egg which one came
[47:25.720 --> 47:29.800]  first the point is then about six years ago white Al Qaeda white Al Qaeda white
[47:29.800 --> 47:34.400]  Al Qaeda white Al Qaeda actually I now that I remember England started it nine
[47:34.400 --> 47:37.800]  years ago so I saw them do it first I didn't actually predict it I'm going
[47:37.800 --> 47:41.200]  back to memory now so it started there and it was coming here so that's going
[47:41.200 --> 47:43.880]  on then I get the manuals from police going yeah this is what they're telling
[47:43.880 --> 47:50.920]  us the rural council to spy on neighbors everything else the I knew from
[47:50.920 --> 47:54.800]  manuals that came in and and sources that all over the country mainly rural
[47:54.800 --> 47:58.680]  areas they'll say we're having a meeting at the law enforcement center this
[47:58.680 --> 48:02.960]  weekend free donuts and lunch anybody who's concerned about Al Qaeda and terror
[48:02.960 --> 48:06.280]  attacks this happened runs from 9-11 and since we want you to come down to the
[48:06.280 --> 48:10.360]  meeting and you get there they show an Al Qaeda training video and they say okay
[48:10.360 --> 48:14.480]  now let's get to McVay let's get to Ron Paul supporters let's get to gun owners
[48:14.480 --> 48:18.000]  let's get to returning veterans and most the folks get upset and leave they
[48:18.000 --> 48:21.880]  don't care they find the people that want to be part of it and I told you
[48:21.880 --> 48:25.240]  they tried to recruit my dad the other dentists he works with not because he's
[48:25.240 --> 48:29.400]  my dad they're doing it to any professionals lawyers any type of
[48:29.400 --> 48:33.800]  corporate CEO even a small companies they give them little cards it's called
[48:33.800 --> 48:37.440]  infraguard they've recruited now over a hundred thousand preachers and they tell
[48:37.440 --> 48:40.600]  them spy on your flock tell them submit to government things are going to
[48:40.600 --> 48:44.160]  collapse this has been going on for six years that we know of the clergy
[48:44.160 --> 48:47.920]  response teams just search that term you'll see newscast after we reported it
[48:47.920 --> 48:51.440]  admitting oh it's great they're they're training to tell the flock to go to the
[48:51.440 --> 48:55.120]  camps and it shows the preacher saying it's of the Lord to go to the camps it's
[48:55.120 --> 48:58.960]  of the Lord to take the shots folks I'm not joking if you haven't seen us play
[48:58.960 --> 49:02.240]  that video here probably 20 times just search clergy response teams on YouTube
[49:02.240 --> 49:05.920]  you'll get it it's also in police state for Rise of FEMA little clips of the
[49:05.920 --> 49:13.800]  news and so they've got the entire grid set up over 90% of the training with
[49:13.800 --> 49:18.920]  police and military together under FBI command under DHS command and you go to
[49:18.920 --> 49:22.520]  these drills or I've been sent photos of the drills and video and and the
[49:22.520 --> 49:30.320]  roster of the drills it's got to be more than 95% it's all people wearing feed
[49:30.320 --> 49:36.000]  lot caps dressed like rednecks going you're not taking my land and then a
[49:36.000 --> 49:41.720]  bomb goes off and they tell the police the farmers attacked us so so they're
[49:41.720 --> 49:46.920]  scripting it and putting farmers in the role that their terrorist the cops play
[49:46.920 --> 49:51.400]  the role and are under so weak-minded they then now believe that farmers are
[49:51.400 --> 49:55.600]  gonna blow them up and so now it's okay with a heavy machine gun they mow the
[49:55.600 --> 50:01.160]  farmers down this was going on in 2002 at bases I had contractors who were
[50:01.160 --> 50:04.800]  working at the base who shot video on top the building they were retiring and
[50:04.800 --> 50:08.880]  they would not let me show the video they came up to access they showed it to
[50:08.880 --> 50:13.800]  me the Marines at an army base and and and the people are like no and of course
[50:13.800 --> 50:17.240]  I shot some video myself at drills of similar things where Americans oh no
[50:17.240 --> 50:20.440]  please not the camp and interrogating them and asking the roleplayers where
[50:20.440 --> 50:23.880]  did you get the guns well I got my gun in San Francisco I mean that's in police
[50:23.880 --> 50:27.440]  day 2000 but these guys showed me footage and I said please let me show
[50:27.440 --> 50:30.760]  this so we'll come back maybe later but they'll know we were contractors and I
[50:30.760 --> 50:33.800]  said I'll blow up the video where they can't tell you were on the roof and they
[50:33.800 --> 50:37.760]  said no we had to sign forms to be on the base we can't do it then I got
[50:37.760 --> 50:41.080]  confirmed news articles where they train all the ROTC's around the country
[50:41.080 --> 50:46.280]  including San Antonio when they have drills in the local forest with the ROTC
[50:46.280 --> 50:50.240]  the military people in college to be officers they always fight militias and
[50:50.240 --> 50:55.840]  anti-fellow reserve people so the entire it's just like our in the Cold War the
[50:55.840 --> 50:59.680]  military trained to fight the Russians for at least ten years the military
[50:59.680 --> 51:02.640]  trains to fight the American people attention gardeners this is an urgent
[51:02.640 --> 51:07.440]  GCN self-reliance update GCN has just discovered a new bioactive superfood for
[51:07.440 --> 51:10.840]  garden plants flowers and herbs it's called protogrow and it's so effective
[51:10.840 --> 51:14.200]  at producing rapid plant growth that it seems to almost force plants to grow
[51:14.200 --> 51:18.040]  like crazy under practically any soil and like conditions now here's the best
[51:18.040 --> 51:21.600]  part for our listeners who garden for self-reliance protogrow's unique blend
[51:21.600 --> 51:25.480]  of sea nutrients maximizes mineral uptake and dramatically increases bloom set
[51:25.480 --> 51:29.280]  creating maximum plant growth in minimum time protogrow works by providing
[51:29.280 --> 51:32.400]  geometric keys which have the capacity to actually unlock the genetic code for
[51:32.400 --> 51:35.760]  nutritional uptake in plants protogrow's full spectrum plant fertility means
[51:35.760 --> 51:38.520]  fruits and vegetables with extraordinary taste enough to ten times the
[51:38.520 --> 51:41.600]  nutritional value and if you want to double or triple the potency of herbs
[51:41.600 --> 51:45.280]  or wheatgrass you can if you want to grow nutritionalized superfoods with non
[51:45.280 --> 51:48.960]  hybrids it's now easy GCN listeners who want to grow dirt cheap superfoods
[51:48.960 --> 51:53.280]  should visit the protogrow website at grow like crazy dot com that's www.grow
[51:53.280 --> 52:00.720]  like crazy dot com or call 877-327-0365 that's 877-327-0365 this is
[52:00.720 --> 52:04.080]  Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power
[52:04.080 --> 52:08.040]  generator number one new climate legislation could easily double or
[52:08.040 --> 52:12.280]  triple your electric bill number two our new energies are wants to control how
[52:12.280 --> 52:16.560]  much power your electric company allows you to have it's true total government
[52:16.560 --> 52:20.920]  control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming number
[52:20.920 --> 52:25.000]  three in some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously overloaded and
[52:25.000 --> 52:29.560]  now new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem number four
[52:29.560 --> 52:33.680]  dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids every year thousands of
[52:33.680 --> 52:37.640]  families lose their power from weather related onages number five a solar power
[52:37.640 --> 52:41.480]  generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind folks I
[52:41.480 --> 52:44.200]  really believe in the solar power generators offered by solutions from
[52:44.200 --> 52:50.200]  science one of my oldest sponsors you can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com
[52:50.200 --> 52:53.920]  that's my solar back up dot com remember the government doesn't own the
[52:53.920 --> 53:01.840]  Sun so go to my solar back up dot com or call 1-877-327-0365 will I have garlic
[53:01.840 --> 53:05.880]  breath after I take Ali see we get that question all the time about the world's

[53:18.320 --> 53:22.640]  blind studies using low doses of Allison greatly reduces the number severity and
[53:22.640 --> 53:27.080]  duration of common colds our powerful Ali see contains 300 milligrams of
[53:27.080 --> 53:32.040]  stabilized Allison just one tablet of Ali see is equivalent to 40 garlic cloves

[54:10.920 --> 54:16.920]  okay I'm gonna play some of this video your prison planet TV you'll be able
[54:16.920 --> 54:22.840]  to see it if not go to info wars dot com and the headline is big sis tries to
[54:22.840 --> 54:26.360]  turn minorities against whites by labeling them terrorists that's one of
[54:26.360 --> 54:30.600]  the articles the other big article that's on drudge is DSS DHS video
[54:30.600 --> 54:34.720]  characterizes white Americans as most likely terrorist and this is why I've
[54:34.720 --> 54:37.920]  always known that even if the government isn't staging the terror and
[54:37.920 --> 54:41.000]  unfortunately the evidence is overwhelming they are it's ridiculous
[54:41.000 --> 54:47.520]  how much evidence there is the entire architecture of homeland security that
[54:47.520 --> 54:51.400]  by the way existed pre-911 you can got documents with Clinton setting it up at
[54:51.400 --> 54:59.080]  in Colorado in 1994 and speeches again they always set something up before they
[54:59.080 --> 55:07.480]  roll it out years later the key here is that they set up the entire architecture
[55:07.480 --> 55:13.280]  and the training and the drills for the American people I only know of one drill
[55:13.280 --> 55:19.000]  and I know about it because I had some family involved out at Camp Mayberry a
[55:19.000 --> 55:23.400]  year ago and the public was invited where they had a guy with a Muslim
[55:23.400 --> 55:27.440]  turbine on and the fake beard and practice killing some terrorist with
[55:27.440 --> 55:30.000]  some helicopters over there and that was just for the public oh look we're
[55:30.000 --> 55:34.120]  killing the Muslims but you go to the real internal drills it is kill those
[55:34.120 --> 55:38.080]  u.s. militias take them out remember New York Times a couple years ago we showed
[55:38.080 --> 55:42.160]  you the article it said explorer scouts nationwide it showed photos trained to
[55:42.160 --> 55:48.680]  kill disgruntled vets it's for you it's for you let's say Al Qaeda did 911 just
[55:48.680 --> 55:53.760]  for you just for laughs okay fine they've used it to set up a grid for the
[55:53.760 --> 55:57.640]  American people and they're now telling minorities who are the majority in most
[55:57.640 --> 56:03.440]  cities hey it's whitey getting and they're now rebranding that so first
[56:03.440 --> 56:06.880]  they tell white racist hey give up your rights because it's only for the
[56:06.880 --> 56:11.280]  Muslims now they say hey give up your rights blacks and Hispanics it's for
[56:11.280 --> 56:15.400]  whitey and when you're done everybody loses their rights this is how they
[56:15.400 --> 56:18.760]  compartmentalize and sell this let's play part of it some of it doesn't have
[56:18.760 --> 56:23.320]  audio so I'll I'll voice it while it while it rolls where it cuts to the new
[56:23.320 --> 56:27.720]  America non-white the good people and then it cuts to the evil whites here it
[56:27.720 --> 56:35.200]  is oh look at the good americans United States of America is home to over 330
[56:35.200 --> 56:42.080]  million people we are a country known for freedom justice and opportunity not
[56:42.080 --> 56:46.320]  a tenor not white in the photos the American dream draws people from
[56:46.320 --> 56:51.280]  across the globe bringing different cultures traditions and ideas to the
[56:51.280 --> 56:54.480]  fabric of our great nation there's a white guy but he's only good as you the
[56:54.480 --> 57:00.920]  military at the same time there's a lot of individuals in the United States who
[57:00.920 --> 57:05.480]  seek to carry out acts of terrorism and violence against our communities and
[57:05.480 --> 57:14.440]  white guy a white fan that's invoke McVeigh the good black guy he recognizes
[57:14.440 --> 57:17.200]  the devil whitey
[57:19.160 --> 57:24.840]  it's also about being paranoid terrorist or everywhere black guy sees the white
[57:24.840 --> 57:29.600]  people oh my gosh they're no white fan they're terrorists he's gonna call online
[57:29.600 --> 57:34.680]  security don't worry and then it just cuts to evil white after evil white
[57:34.680 --> 57:39.840]  after evil white and they say whites are the number one threat which is what
[57:39.840 --> 57:49.400]  their own manuals say again even though whiteies are with al-qaeda more whiteies
[57:49.400 --> 57:53.880]  he's hiding down the seat oh no the whiteies
[57:55.560 --> 58:00.360]  he's driving out of those are some scary whiteies
[58:00.360 --> 58:08.040]  calls homeland security though the good whites come hello listen I don't know if
[58:08.040 --> 58:12.440]  this is anything but what I just saw look really suspicious oh definitely out
[58:12.440 --> 58:17.800]  of the ordinary I was in the parking lot pause we're gonna come back with the
[58:17.800 --> 58:21.320]  rest of it oh hey I saw something out of the ordinary I saw a US government
[58:21.320 --> 58:26.880]  agent get a drugged out black kid on the airplane in Amsterdam yeah he didn't
[58:26.880 --> 58:31.080]  have a passport or anything but they got him on the plane shut up mr. Haskell
[58:31.080 --> 58:34.520]  we don't know anything about that by the way the firecracker blew up in his pants
[58:34.520 --> 58:38.040]  I want to give you a report shut up mr. Haskell turned out it was all true I
[58:38.040 --> 58:41.600]  want to report the government's the terrorist
[58:43.640 --> 58:52.480]  this is GCN the Genesis Communications radio network a very wealthy US citizen

[59:53.160 --> 1:00:00.680]  waging war on corruption Alex Jones on the GCM radio network
[1:00:04.640 --> 1:00:12.680]  big brother mainstream media government cover-ups you on answers well so does he
[1:00:12.680 --> 1:00:19.960]  he's Alex Jones on the GCM radio network and now live from Austin Texas
[1:00:19.960 --> 1:00:28.080]  Alex Jones coming up in the next segment I'm gonna finish getting into the big
[1:00:28.080 --> 1:00:36.080]  news report DHS video characterizes white Americans is most likely terrorist and
[1:00:36.080 --> 1:00:39.720]  then we are gonna open the phones up they're not open yet but I'm open the
[1:00:39.720 --> 1:00:43.720]  phones up specifically do you see through this he first they say get rid of
[1:00:43.720 --> 1:00:47.560]  America's liberties cuz you know it's brown folks we want to go after and so a
[1:00:47.560 --> 1:00:50.920]  lot of whites go yeah I'm scared of brown people even if you're not racist
[1:00:50.920 --> 1:00:54.600]  some whites are so guilt-ridden they're scared and so okay well we're just
[1:00:54.600 --> 1:00:58.440]  taking the Muslims rights of the brown people rights and then now they've got
[1:00:58.440 --> 1:01:01.880]  that in place okay now they're gonna shift it over no it's the whitey he's
[1:01:01.880 --> 1:01:05.120]  gonna get you to get the minorities after it and this nine minute video goes on
[1:01:05.120 --> 1:01:09.680]  and on you know we're 90% of the photos of the good people are quote my
[1:01:09.680 --> 1:01:12.560]  minorities though you know there's only a few whites and then the black guys
[1:01:12.560 --> 1:01:18.120]  reporting on the whites and then GI Jane or eyes for you know shining blue have
[1:01:18.120 --> 1:01:22.800]  been accentuated I mean clearly somebody that works in media and and
[1:01:22.800 --> 1:01:26.520]  recognizes propaganda this is off the chart then we have all the actual
[1:01:26.520 --> 1:01:30.200]  training manuals that law enforcement have given us where it's all about Ron
[1:01:30.200 --> 1:01:36.520]  Paul conservatives libertarians gun owners patriots and then they make it
[1:01:36.520 --> 1:01:42.520]  about being white because they say and these people are probably racist you see
[1:01:42.520 --> 1:01:48.480]  so which then makes it racial and so that's how they're always injecting this
[1:01:48.480 --> 1:01:54.000]  and you know talking about McVeigh and Elohim City in the Oklahoma City bombing
[1:01:54.000 --> 1:01:59.840]  but never getting into the fact that those were staged events here's part of
[1:01:59.840 --> 1:02:02.640]  Paul Watson's article and we'll come back with the rest of the video in my
[1:02:02.640 --> 1:02:07.600]  analysis of it DHS video characterizes white Americans as most likely
[1:02:07.600 --> 1:02:12.720]  terrorist big sis fear campaign continues but Americans are just as
[1:02:12.720 --> 1:02:20.000]  likely to be killed by peanut allergies then they are in terrorist attacks a new
[1:02:20.000 --> 1:02:22.720]  promotional video released by the Department of Homeland Security
[1:02:22.720 --> 1:02:26.120]  characterizes white middle-class Americans as the most likely terrorist
[1:02:26.120 --> 1:02:30.280]  as big sis continues its relentless drive we should add some articles where
[1:02:30.280 --> 1:02:34.040]  they talk about white al-qaeda the next threat you know we know what this is also
[1:02:34.040 --> 1:02:39.320]  because of the past scripting as big sis continues it was relentless drive to
[1:02:39.320 --> 1:02:43.640]  submit the myth that mad bombers are hiding around every corner when in
[1:02:43.640 --> 1:02:47.560]  reality Americans are just as likely to be killed by lightning strikes or peanut
[1:02:47.560 --> 1:02:52.240]  allergies the video is part of a Homeland Security 10 million dollar see
[1:02:52.240 --> 1:02:55.640]  something say something program that encourages Americans to report suspicious
[1:02:55.640 --> 1:03:00.040]  activity which in every case throughout history has been a trait of oppressive
[1:03:00.040 --> 1:03:04.800]  dictatorial regimes it's all about not trusting your fellow citizens only
[1:03:04.800 --> 1:03:10.480]  trusting the big mommy government who's on record staging the terror attacks in
[1:03:10.480 --> 1:03:14.680]  the course of a 10-minute clip a myriad of different behavior and characterized
[1:03:14.680 --> 1:03:18.320]  as terrorism including opposing surveillance oh yeah people that don't
[1:03:18.320 --> 1:03:22.360]  like being surveilled using a video camera that's why cops come in your own
[1:03:22.360 --> 1:03:26.880]  yard and see can't videotape him talking to police officers yeah you don't talk
[1:03:26.880 --> 1:03:32.240]  to the godlike government wearing hoodies driving vans riding on a piece
[1:03:32.240 --> 1:03:35.600]  of paper and using a cell phone recording application and that's in
[1:03:35.600 --> 1:03:39.120]  manuals we got five years ago the feds put out the state of Texas it said
[1:03:39.120 --> 1:03:43.600]  having a cell phone wearing blue jeans I saw an AP article where it said don't
[1:03:43.600 --> 1:03:47.080]  just trust that priest or that woman with a baby carriage they may be the
[1:03:47.080 --> 1:03:50.880]  terrorist it's about everybody's a terrorist first they start with the
[1:03:50.880 --> 1:03:56.440]  unpopular Muslims then they move on to the blacks in America then they move on
[1:03:56.440 --> 1:04:04.160]  to the whiteies continuing here despite encouraging viewers not to pay
[1:04:04.160 --> 1:04:07.360]  attention to a person's race in determining whether or not they may be a
[1:04:07.360 --> 1:04:11.360]  terrorist almost all the scenarios in the clip proceed to portray white
[1:04:11.360 --> 1:04:15.520]  people as the most likely terrorist and they show like one 9-11 hijacker
[1:04:15.520 --> 1:04:19.440]  bizarrely nearly every single one of the patriotic Americans who reports on
[1:04:19.440 --> 1:04:24.200]  their fellow citizens either black Arab or Asian again this is all heavily
[1:04:24.200 --> 1:04:28.240]  scripted they decide all this stuff before in imagine if the video portrayed
[1:04:28.240 --> 1:04:33.680]  every terrorist as an Arab and every patriotic snoop is white there'd be an
[1:04:33.680 --> 1:04:38.560]  outcry and rightly so but this strange reversal must have been deliberate on
[1:04:38.560 --> 1:04:43.400]  the part of the DHS but why is this merely political correctness taken to
[1:04:43.400 --> 1:04:46.200]  the extreme or is this something deeper at work well we have all the training

[1:07:58.320 --> 1:08:08.840]  he's the t-rex of political talk Alex Jones on the GCN radio network
[1:08:20.800 --> 1:08:26.800]  we have warned of this for years that first governments throughout history
[1:08:26.800 --> 1:08:31.720]  get rid of the country's liberties and freedoms by going after an unpopular
[1:08:31.720 --> 1:08:36.040]  minority group Hitler it was the Jews communist stuff like that here it was
[1:08:36.040 --> 1:08:41.800]  the Muslims the system stages the events provocateurs nutcases it's a whole
[1:08:41.800 --> 1:08:46.480]  grab bag of different types of provocateur terror then they built the
[1:08:46.480 --> 1:08:51.680]  architecture of the police state for the general public so they have white
[1:08:51.680 --> 1:08:55.920]  audiences where they say we're going after the brown people and they go to the
[1:08:55.920 --> 1:08:59.840]  brown audiences and they say we're going after the white people and that's what
[1:08:59.840 --> 1:09:04.040]  this nearly 10 minute Department of Homeland Security video does but it's
[1:09:04.040 --> 1:09:07.240]  worse than that we have all the different training manuals sent to us by
[1:09:07.240 --> 1:09:10.680]  police and military over the years that we've published and have made national
[1:09:10.680 --> 1:09:15.360]  news Homeland Security my act the list goes on and on and in the training over
[1:09:15.360 --> 1:09:21.640]  90% is for what remember a few years ago veterans seen as the number one terror
[1:09:21.640 --> 1:09:25.800]  threat returning home remember a few months ago okay finally Congress
[1:09:25.800 --> 1:09:30.200]  voted for health care for the military police and fire veterans 9-11 but you
[1:09:30.200 --> 1:09:32.840]  got to go through a terror database every time you get your health care
[1:09:32.840 --> 1:09:38.240]  they're setting that precedent Ron Paul supporters Bob Barr supporters people
[1:09:38.240 --> 1:09:43.160]  that like America freedom to fascism people that like Alex Jones this is in
[1:09:43.160 --> 1:09:47.840]  the different manuals and then they say these groups are connected to racism so
[1:09:47.840 --> 1:09:50.600]  they make it about being white by saying oh they're connected to white
[1:09:50.600 --> 1:09:54.040]  supremacists when there's no connection meanwhile Hal Turner one of the top
[1:09:54.040 --> 1:09:58.120]  Nazis it turns out in federal court high-level FBI operative for decades
[1:09:58.120 --> 1:10:03.000]  working of course with Sean Hannity that came out just look up Hal Turner
[1:10:03.000 --> 1:10:07.760]  Sean Hannity very bizarre these people are operatives by the way that's in the
[1:10:07.760 --> 1:10:11.880]  news today that they ran black op intelligence systems London telegraph
[1:10:11.880 --> 1:10:17.560]  reports that news core its division in England was running black op
[1:10:17.560 --> 1:10:21.400]  intelligence operations and their reporters were basically private
[1:10:21.400 --> 1:10:26.880]  contractor agents working with MI6 of course they are ladies and gentlemen
[1:10:26.880 --> 1:10:30.400]  what do you know about Operation Mockingbird here in the United States I
[1:10:30.400 --> 1:10:35.440]  mean we're in deep deep deep deep trouble and so they branded the war on
[1:10:35.440 --> 1:10:38.840]  terror when we're taking the rights away but we're only gonna enforce it on the
[1:10:38.840 --> 1:10:45.400]  evil Muslims in quotes now it's oh my gosh the white al-Qaeda and in every one
[1:10:45.400 --> 1:10:50.400]  of the scenarios except one in a 10-minute video it's quote minorities
[1:10:50.400 --> 1:10:56.520]  Asians blacks Hispanics reporting on the evil whites and it just goes on and on
[1:10:56.520 --> 1:10:59.800]  and on despite encouraging viewers not to pay attention to the person's race
[1:10:59.800 --> 1:11:03.080]  and determining whether or not they may be a terrorist almost all the scenarios
[1:11:03.080 --> 1:11:07.120]  in the clip proceed to portray white people as the most likely terrorists
[1:11:07.120 --> 1:11:11.240]  bizarrely nearly every single one of the patriotic Americans who reports on
[1:11:11.240 --> 1:11:15.840]  their fellow citizens is either black Asian or Arab imagine in the video it
[1:11:15.840 --> 1:11:21.160]  portrayed every terrorist as an Arab and every patriotic snoopus white there'd
[1:11:21.160 --> 1:11:25.960]  be an outcry and rightly so but this strange reversal must have been
[1:11:25.960 --> 1:11:30.200]  deliberate on the part of the DHS but why is this merely political correctness
[1:11:30.200 --> 1:11:33.040]  taken to the extreme or is it something deeper at work and then he goes to the
[1:11:33.040 --> 1:11:37.000]  proof that it's absolutely what's been going on behind the scenes so they're
[1:11:37.000 --> 1:11:43.280]  now shifting it on the American people DHS checkpoints homeland security TSA
[1:11:43.280 --> 1:11:49.400]  running wild this is the total takeover and it's meant to make all of us not
[1:11:49.400 --> 1:11:53.040]  trust each other and divide and conquer and only trust the nanny state don't
[1:11:53.040 --> 1:11:58.600]  trust other Walmart shoppers the telescreen say only trust big sis who of
[1:11:58.600 --> 1:12:02.000]  course helped get the underwear bomber on the plane on record and who helped
[1:12:02.000 --> 1:12:06.800]  ship the guns into Mexico and to blame the Second Amendment but she's good
[1:12:06.800 --> 1:12:16.160]  though continuing here this has to do with the color of a person's skin and
[1:12:16.160 --> 1:12:19.120]  everything to do this is little to do with the color of a person's skin
[1:12:19.120 --> 1:12:23.080]  everything to do with the fact that white middle-class Americans are the
[1:12:23.080 --> 1:12:26.600]  biggest roadblock when it comes to big sis expanding its control over every
[1:12:26.600 --> 1:12:31.720]  facet of society well now they're just tackling the big egg it's plain to see
[1:12:31.720 --> 1:12:37.160]  that very little of the budget for this video went towards paying for decent
[1:12:37.160 --> 1:12:41.440]  actors but perhaps it's fitting that the participants were about as believable
[1:12:41.440 --> 1:12:45.800]  as Santa and his elves because the notion that terrorists are hovering around
[1:12:45.800 --> 1:12:49.560]  every underground parking lot waiting to blow up federal buildings is
[1:12:49.560 --> 1:12:54.840]  demonstratably false actually when Jane Graham up in the HUD building saw
[1:12:54.840 --> 1:12:59.920]  McVeigh and other feds planning bombs and warn people they didn't want to hear
[1:12:59.920 --> 1:13:06.200]  about it in Oklahoma City as Ohio University John Mueller has documented
[1:13:06.200 --> 1:13:10.240]  the likelihood of actually being a victim of terrorism is infatestimally
[1:13:10.240 --> 1:13:15.480]  small and only highlights how much threats are hyperbolically exaggerated
[1:13:15.480 --> 1:13:20.000]  for political purposes figures collected by Mueller clearly show that Americans
[1:13:20.000 --> 1:13:24.920]  are just as likely to be killed by lightning strikes accidents by running
[1:13:24.920 --> 1:13:29.440]  into deer or severe allergic reactions to peanuts but the facts don't matter
[1:13:29.440 --> 1:13:33.560]  for a federal agency whose primary function is to manufacture fear as former
[1:13:33.560 --> 1:13:36.760]  head of Homeland Security Governor Ridge admitted he was ordered to do see we
[1:13:36.760 --> 1:13:41.200]  have all the facts here to keep Americans under control and submissive to the
[1:13:41.200 --> 1:13:44.880]  fact that their economic futures and their constitutional rights are being
[1:13:44.880 --> 1:13:50.280]  torn to shreds by their own government while it points to a contrived outside
[1:13:50.280 --> 1:13:55.720]  threat as a convenient distraction at its core the video was filled with scenes
[1:13:55.720 --> 1:13:59.240]  of ordinary citizens spying on each other and alerting the authorities to
[1:13:59.240 --> 1:14:04.880]  their compatriots suspicious deeds writes Simon black in my favorite scene a
[1:14:04.880 --> 1:14:09.680]  woman calls the police after snooping over the shoulder of a young man typing
[1:14:09.680 --> 1:14:14.280]  away on a smartphone black notes that such videos are solely aimed at
[1:14:14.280 --> 1:14:18.360]  reinforcing ignorance hate and fear for those who still live in darkness and are
[1:14:18.360 --> 1:14:21.920]  completely unaware of the real agenda behind Homeland Security's see something
[1:14:21.920 --> 1:14:25.200]  say something charade by the way I'm gonna call Watson during the break and
[1:14:25.200 --> 1:14:29.120]  during that part about the feds issuing terror alerts to create artificial
[1:14:29.120 --> 1:14:32.520]  fear and make you love them and not love your neighbor I'm gonna have him at a
[1:14:32.520 --> 1:14:35.360]  link to Ridge admitting that I think we need to even document that more for
[1:14:35.360 --> 1:14:40.080]  folks no matter where you look from East Germany to communist Russia to Nazi
[1:14:40.080 --> 1:14:43.360]  Germany historically governments who encourage their own citizens to report
[1:14:43.360 --> 1:14:48.520]  on each other do so not out of a genuine safety concerns or presume benefits to
[1:14:48.520 --> 1:14:52.080]  security but in order to create an authoritarian police state that coerces
[1:14:52.080 --> 1:14:55.440]  the people into policing each other's behavior and thoughts and to create a
[1:14:55.440 --> 1:14:59.360]  big shelling effect as well I better not speak out about freedom you know my
[1:14:59.360 --> 1:15:03.560]  my neighbor will call Homeland Security on me well let them they're the terrorist
[1:15:03.560 --> 1:15:07.320]  anyways just get it out in the open we all know you blew up the towers you
[1:15:07.320 --> 1:15:14.160]  murdering military industrial complex bank around scum as Robert Jalanti of
[1:15:14.160 --> 1:15:18.240]  Florida State University has highlighted Germans under Hitler denounced their
[1:15:18.240 --> 1:15:22.360]  neighbors and friends not because they generally believe them to be a security
[1:15:22.360 --> 1:15:26.280]  threat but because they expected to selfishly benefit from doing so both
[1:15:26.280 --> 1:15:30.080]  financially and socially and psychologically via a Pavlovian need to
[1:15:30.080 --> 1:15:34.440]  be rewarded by their masters for their obedience and that's how now you hear
[1:15:34.440 --> 1:15:38.080]  ads about report if your boss is pirating software report if your
[1:15:38.080 --> 1:15:42.080]  neighbors spanking their kid was not even legal report people who are
[1:15:42.080 --> 1:15:47.480]  homeschooling all of this is about getting social reward or feeling like
[1:15:47.480 --> 1:15:50.040]  you've been patted on the head in fact I didn't get into it but you guys
[1:15:50.040 --> 1:15:55.760]  repull the study from yesterday big international and major u.s. university
[1:15:55.760 --> 1:16:01.520]  study and concert that found that people will say a barn door is blue if
[1:16:01.520 --> 1:16:09.680]  authority figures tell them it's blue even if the barn door is red and that's
[1:16:09.680 --> 1:16:13.200]  what you have different TV shows illustrating this how peer pressure
[1:16:13.200 --> 1:16:19.080]  works and so people relish calling and tattling on their neighbors they get a
[1:16:19.080 --> 1:16:25.120]  thrill like the authority loves them any free society abhors telling on
[1:16:25.120 --> 1:16:30.280]  somebody even if what somebody's doing is wrong in the old days you would just
[1:16:30.280 --> 1:16:34.760]  take care of it yourself I mean you know only the very worst stuff would be
[1:16:34.760 --> 1:16:41.760]  reported because people knew how dangerous a snitch society was and it
[1:16:41.760 --> 1:16:48.200]  goes on through the rest of this I mean this is just classical tyranny let's go
[1:16:48.200 --> 1:16:51.120]  ahead and start getting into the rest of the video as I analyze it here
[1:16:51.120 --> 1:16:55.560]  prison planet TV viewers can see it but we're here critiquing this taxpayer
[1:16:55.560 --> 1:16:59.720]  paid for propaganda we have the video posted up at info wars comm in our
[1:16:59.720 --> 1:17:03.200]  articles but let's continue you know you got the black guy calling in the evil
[1:17:03.200 --> 1:17:07.120]  white people and then it cuts to a bunch of shots of news articles of white
[1:17:07.120 --> 1:17:10.600]  terrorists in every case mentally ill provocateurs or purely staged
[1:17:10.600 --> 1:17:15.960]  government ops like McVeigh it has animated blue eyes shining oh my gosh
[1:17:15.960 --> 1:17:21.280]  the white devil is going to get you here it is
[1:17:21.280 --> 1:17:26.640]  worry on that security's not easy to put all the pieces together and we don't
[1:17:26.640 --> 1:17:32.520]  expect you to that's the job of law enforcement I pause I forgot to point
[1:17:32.520 --> 1:17:39.520]  this out you've got one of the federal and local top police analyst predicting
[1:17:39.520 --> 1:17:43.800]  future terror threats mr. Pharrell over in England when he found out it was the
[1:17:43.800 --> 1:17:47.880]  government behind 7 7 and he said the new threat and he brought up that other
[1:17:47.880 --> 1:17:51.120]  cases of where it was admitted with the British government at stage terror they
[1:17:51.120 --> 1:17:56.040]  fired him so see all they want is little dumb down control freaks work I've
[1:17:56.040 --> 1:18:00.080]  tried on air to call Homeland Security to report terror over and over again and
[1:18:00.080 --> 1:18:06.440]  the numbers don't work or nobody answers it's all fake it's all fake they use the
[1:18:06.440 --> 1:18:10.400]  NSA to spy on people so in case you find out the government's about the stage of
[1:18:10.400 --> 1:18:15.040]  terror attack or a corporation is to get naked body scanners in or whatever the
[1:18:15.040 --> 1:18:19.560]  case is so they can use an essay spying to make sure police don't get alerted
[1:18:19.560 --> 1:18:23.840]  and that they can go forward with the bombing let's continue with the video
[1:18:23.840 --> 1:18:30.240]  but Homeland Security is a shared effort and responsibility for each of us when
[1:18:30.240 --> 1:18:34.160]  you see things that just don't seem right that seems somehow out of the
[1:18:34.160 --> 1:18:39.080]  ordinary reporting what you observe can be invaluable to the work of others one
[1:18:39.080 --> 1:18:44.000]  good white guy reporting on the other evil whitey shared effort acts of
[1:18:44.000 --> 1:18:48.440]  terrorism against the United States can be large or small big and we've cuz
[1:18:48.440 --> 1:18:52.200]  in skiing their horrific images on television or in the hot chain with

[1:33:51.880 --> 1:33:56.120]  confiscation drill and the paper freaked out on me and said the town's gotten

[1:33:59.680 --> 1:34:06.640]  confiscation drill but for Iraq mm-hmm and the government just got caught

[1:34:18.840 --> 1:34:21.640]  there's been more deaths from the 30 something thousand guns they shipped and
[1:34:21.640 --> 1:34:28.200]  went died 168 or whatever it was at Oklahoma City it'd be like catching

[1:41:46.240 --> 1:41:51.640]  watching and listening and they know who to watch they know who to watch private

[1:42:14.640 --> 1:42:18.360]  because a lot of us don't care what you do to us we're totally committed because
[1:42:18.360 --> 1:42:21.560]  we know your murderers and we know there's no future if we don't stop you
[1:42:21.560 --> 1:42:26.640]  murdering control freak eugenics filth okay Maggie in California you're on the
[1:42:26.640 --> 1:42:33.360]  air welcome thank you I went to the drudge report and I clicked on the DHS
[1:42:33.360 --> 1:42:38.760]  link and I got about five and a half minutes into it and I was horrified
[1:42:38.760 --> 1:42:45.160]  everything you said was true so I called Senator Lieberman's office chairman
[1:42:45.160 --> 1:42:52.080]  the Mossad officer and I got nothing no response I mean it was just whatever
[1:42:52.080 --> 1:42:56.520]  lady and so I called my own congressman's office and not much better
[1:42:56.520 --> 1:43:03.640]  response and I thought you know one person can't do it but I explained that crime
[1:43:03.640 --> 1:43:09.920]  is not a color and why aren't you focusing on the 99.9% of the terrorists
[1:43:09.920 --> 1:43:15.960]  that are attacking everyone in the world and I just my encouragement to
[1:43:15.960 --> 1:43:21.840]  everyone listening is look at the report look at the video look at the history
[1:43:21.840 --> 1:43:26.640]  and start calling everybody you can think of to call exactly let me add this
[1:43:26.640 --> 1:43:30.000]  because let's just say the Muslims did 9-11 and Norad stood down in the
[1:43:30.000 --> 1:43:35.640]  Easter bunnies reel why in the internal manuals is it all about non-Muslims why
[1:43:35.640 --> 1:43:40.560]  did they had a homeland security a month ago mr. Napolitano why did he say I
[1:43:40.560 --> 1:43:45.240]  mean she say that that that that the number one threat is domestics and then
[1:43:45.240 --> 1:43:50.400]  it was illogical to profile and focus on Muslims if the Muslims really did 911
[1:43:50.400 --> 1:43:55.360]  and this is all for 9-11 well then why is it for everybody because I'm sorry man
[1:43:55.360 --> 1:44:01.040]  go ahead no you're making valid points and I go back to that Missouri report the
[1:44:01.040 --> 1:44:09.240]  DHS connected things several years ago everybody in there was a Christian or a
[1:44:09.240 --> 1:44:15.600]  Second Amendment or a libertarian and those are the core values of America and
[1:44:15.600 --> 1:44:20.960]  it seems like anything my father was a paratrooper he jumped out of
[1:44:20.960 --> 1:44:26.720]  perfectly good airplanes in Germany in World War two so I was raised to love
[1:44:26.720 --> 1:44:31.800]  my country and I am horrified at what I'm seeing well you love the troops in the
[1:44:31.800 --> 1:44:35.520]  old America that was good but this court America's had a corporate takeover
[1:44:35.520 --> 1:44:39.520]  happened and so of course they're destroying everything that is the
[1:44:39.520 --> 1:44:43.640]  spirit of the United States and then wrapping their tyranny in the flag and
[1:44:43.640 --> 1:44:51.280]  hoping to confuse people but folks are waking up I if everybody calls maybe we
[1:44:51.280 --> 1:44:55.480]  can I don't know maybe I believe in the tooth fairy no no no I think it's good
[1:44:55.480 --> 1:44:59.240]  to call them and let them know it's a scam but also let other people know it's
[1:44:59.240 --> 1:45:02.280]  a scam and get the article out to everybody good job Maggie now this
[1:45:02.280 --> 1:45:06.400]  story has gone mega viral it is on thousands of new sites now I mean this
[1:45:06.400 --> 1:45:10.160]  is gonna be one of the biggest reports we ever put out because folks are finally
[1:45:10.160 --> 1:45:13.840]  getting in I told you this was coming thank you Maggie Kate in Florida you're
[1:45:13.840 --> 1:45:19.400]  on the air go ahead hey Alex I know it's no laughing matter but I just I just
[1:45:19.400 --> 1:45:22.640]  want to say I could listen to you for three hours doing voiceovers with this
[1:45:22.640 --> 1:45:27.760]  with videos like this it's hilarious man well it is hilarious if it wasn't so
[1:45:27.760 --> 1:45:31.840]  dangerous I mean they're getting ready I mean they're not saying TSA is gonna be
[1:45:31.840 --> 1:45:34.840]  on the streets for nothing they're gonna start blowing stuff up and then saying
[1:45:34.840 --> 1:45:38.200]  we're allowed to be anywhere and stick our hands down your pants anywhere and
[1:45:38.200 --> 1:45:41.720]  they're announcing they're gonna start groping genitals at malls on the sides of
[1:45:41.720 --> 1:45:46.000]  highways taking blood under federal grants without warrants they want in
[1:45:46.000 --> 1:45:50.880]  your person they want to touch you without warrants they want in your life
[1:45:50.880 --> 1:45:55.960]  sure I mean the writing on the wall is is pretty transparent for anyone that is
[1:45:55.960 --> 1:46:02.720]  awake to see what I fear is and I hope it's not the vast majority but I hope
[1:46:02.720 --> 1:46:07.760]  the I fear that the vast majority of people will not be able to see through
[1:46:07.760 --> 1:46:12.840]  this and actually get into such a you know a frenzy of fear and think that
[1:46:12.840 --> 1:46:18.920]  they can call the terrorists and report terrorism and when the other house
[1:46:18.920 --> 1:46:24.760]  divided amongst itself cannot stand and when the excrement hits the fan which I
[1:46:24.760 --> 1:46:29.760]  fear like you that it will eventually regardless of its terrorism or if it's
[1:46:29.760 --> 1:46:35.200]  you know financial terrorism I just think that people divided and arguing
[1:46:35.200 --> 1:46:39.720]  amongst each other is going to be the biggest obstacle that we and I'm when I
[1:46:39.720 --> 1:46:44.600]  say we the enlightened the people that can awaken well no you're right we had
[1:46:44.600 --> 1:46:49.560]  so much liberty that we became decadent and slovenly and now a lot of spoiled
[1:46:49.560 --> 1:46:53.360]  rotten Americans have got a rude awakening coming and it's going to be
[1:46:53.360 --> 1:46:57.480]  staged terror along with financial terror because they're gonna want to make
[1:46:57.480 --> 1:47:01.200]  you rally around the terrorist who will claim they're protecting you so I'm
[1:47:01.200 --> 1:47:05.600]  telling you can see all the prescripting just like we saw before 9 11 they're
[1:47:05.600 --> 1:47:14.080]  getting ready to pull the trigger and it is going to be hellish I appreciate
[1:47:14.080 --> 1:47:18.560]  your call anything else take no but I I just encourage everyone like you said
[1:47:18.560 --> 1:47:23.520]  to you know call like the woman the previous caller just said or or get

[1:47:34.240 --> 1:47:37.960]  love what America really stands for it didn't perfect but its heads above it's
[1:47:37.960 --> 1:47:42.040]  a million miles better than anything else we've seen in the world I've studied
[1:47:42.040 --> 1:47:45.800]  history it works it's great we've gotten away from it so it's not working it's

[1:54:58.520 --> 1:55:02.680]  they're gonna roll them out later like bin Laden and how they work and how they
[1:55:02.680 --> 1:55:07.840]  work and and why am I risking my life for bringing this information because

[2:01:56.760 --> 2:02:01.600]  episode I already know I know the script they're teaching everyone that if
[2:02:01.600 --> 2:02:05.640]  you're not an idiot and you own guns you're the enemy because the foreign
[2:02:05.640 --> 2:02:09.560]  banks are gonna gang rape America and they're not gonna let scumbag armed
[2:02:09.560 --> 2:02:13.760]  Americans that know they're the enemy getting their way okay now you can wake
[2:02:13.760 --> 2:02:17.400]  up to this or you can't if you don't wake up they're gonna have their way with
[2:02:17.400 --> 2:02:22.080]  you Janice finishing up the show about the evil veterans of the that are the
[2:02:22.080 --> 2:02:27.000]  real Al Qaeda we've now got a face well the the big question that hangs in my
[2:02:27.000 --> 2:02:31.400]  mind is that if POWs are so bad then why aren't they arresting John McCain who
[2:02:31.400 --> 2:02:37.480]  wants a hundred years of war you know I mean hello it's it's so ridiculous well
[2:02:37.480 --> 2:02:40.160]  that's because they already know they're taking all the pension funds and pay and
[2:02:40.160 --> 2:02:44.440]  health care from the vets and and and and they're gonna go after the vets and
[2:02:44.440 --> 2:02:49.400]  it's it's it's freedom though and say why are you doing this because she's
[2:02:49.400 --> 2:02:53.320]  proud of it she's like on you know talking about you know the behind the
[2:02:53.320 --> 2:02:58.480]  scenes dirty veterans a terrorist and he does turn out to be one correct yes of
[2:02:58.480 --> 2:03:02.920]  course he's he's and he stares at the Capitol with the hoodie you know they
[2:03:02.920 --> 2:03:06.240]  always have to have hoodies but he's the guy to you said he talks about the
[2:03:06.240 --> 2:03:10.160]  Constitution a lot he said there's an allen watt conspiracy type guy right
[2:03:10.160 --> 2:03:14.880]  they always have that guy her boss he tells her not to do it he's like you
[2:03:14.880 --> 2:03:18.680]  can't do it you can't do it he you know it's against the Constitution she goes
[2:03:18.680 --> 2:03:22.560]  but we have to save our country like all those shows where the heroes are the
[2:03:22.560 --> 2:03:27.040]  torturers under bush and then we find out they're raping small children in Abu
[2:03:27.040 --> 2:03:30.520]  Ghraib with giant objects dripping with battery acid and the good old boys are
[2:03:30.520 --> 2:03:34.640]  like it's of the Lord Jesus would approve of that and then now the old
[2:03:34.640 --> 2:03:38.040]  bomb people are like yeah let's do it let's get tough because the new TV ads
[2:03:38.040 --> 2:03:42.400]  are white he's the terrorist and we're gonna get him right so they say see for
[2:03:42.400 --> 2:03:45.320]  conservatives we're gonna get brown people and they go yeah let's get them
[2:03:45.320 --> 2:03:49.880]  brown people and then for the liberals we're gonna get whitey and and and and
[2:03:49.880 --> 2:03:54.640]  what's the story one lady could eat no lean and the other guy could eat no fat
[2:03:54.640 --> 2:04:00.040]  but but between the two they lick the platter clean nursery rhyme yeah that's
[2:04:00.040 --> 2:04:05.640]  I got it backwards but yeah something like that it's just it's so horrific Alex

[2:07:26.120 --> 2:07:30.000]  biggest small-owner general growth properties in fact Barron's called his

[2:07:58.160 --> 2:08:01.880]  that's end of america3.com
[2:08:01.880 --> 2:08:07.520]  essentially I will start from the beginning this is a lot of stuff you
[2:08:07.520 --> 2:08:12.200]  have a real issue with with the fact when there's 19 of the 19 hijackers they
[2:08:12.200 --> 2:08:17.000]  put up on the website and like five or seven of them are still alive so that
[2:08:17.000 --> 2:08:22.120]  that in and of itself grinds your story to a halt grinds the official story to a
[2:08:22.120 --> 2:08:25.360]  halt building seven there's no way that building wasn't detonated everybody
[2:08:25.360 --> 2:08:28.920]  knows it nobody wants to talk about it except for the people who from an
[2:08:28.920 --> 2:08:32.200]  architectural standpoint or engineering point of view just go there's no other
[2:08:32.200 --> 2:08:36.360]  way this building came down if nothing fell on it there was not enough fire end
[2:08:36.360 --> 2:08:42.080]  of story buildings don't fall like that that's just stupid absolutely from from
[2:08:42.080 --> 2:08:46.440]  that point of view then you have to just on those two pages basis alone the fact
[2:08:46.440 --> 2:08:50.400]  people they said that actually caused it are some of them are still alive right
[2:08:50.400 --> 2:08:55.320]  but all of them are Saudi you know and none of them were from Afghanistan or Iraq
[2:08:55.320 --> 2:08:59.080]  right why were you beating up Iraq and Afghanistan well different reasons
[2:08:59.080 --> 2:09:03.320]  preventing Iraq because you know we set that guy up he was one of our sort of
[2:09:03.320 --> 2:09:07.400]  CIA stooches for a long time he was gonna monetize he was gonna change the
[2:09:07.400 --> 2:09:12.560]  money that in the oil trade from dollars to euros so and and at the talk of that
[2:09:12.560 --> 2:09:16.840]  that the euro went from 61 cents to over a dollar and then we went to Iraq like
[2:09:16.840 --> 2:09:21.360]  that right Afghanistan similar problems except for you know there's a natural
[2:09:21.360 --> 2:09:24.000]  gas pipeline they're gonna put through there is an oil pipeline and there's
[2:09:24.000 --> 2:09:27.120]  gold in the hills nobody talks about that but there's gold those tour of our
[2:09:27.120 --> 2:09:29.920]  Hills where they're only so why don't we just nuke that whole area well because
[2:09:29.920 --> 2:09:32.360]  there's a lot of gold in there and you know it and that's what we're in there
[2:09:32.360 --> 2:09:36.240]  getting out right and there of course is the opium trade that we're also right
[2:09:36.240 --> 2:09:40.920]  but that's quite frankly that's the fast microphone yeah that's quite frankly the
[2:09:40.920 --> 2:09:44.880]  fast food element of it the drug trade is the little the least of it and
[2:09:44.880 --> 2:09:47.760]  considering that without that money it wouldn't prop up our entire government
[2:09:47.760 --> 2:09:52.400]  half the time drug money actually saved this country largely during the you know
[2:09:52.400 --> 2:09:56.360]  the crash I mean there was a exchange of like $500 million that was constantly
[2:09:56.360 --> 2:09:58.960]  shifting through all drug money and everybody knew it and they just kind of
[2:09:58.960 --> 2:10:03.680]  took a backseat less enforcement because without that money would have yanked
[2:10:03.680 --> 2:10:07.600]  some banks dead right you've got all that stuff going on you have a
[2:10:07.600 --> 2:10:11.120]  responsibility I think to at least look deeper you don't have to go all the way
[2:10:11.120 --> 2:10:13.600]  down the rabbit hole with some people you also can't stick your head in the
[2:10:13.600 --> 2:10:18.720]  sand and act like so other than that I have no opinion
[2:10:18.720 --> 2:10:24.360]  we now take you live to the central Texas Command Center in the heart of the
[2:10:24.360 --> 2:10:31.080]  resistance you're listening to the Alex Jones show all right for the rest of the

[2:11:36.000 --> 2:11:40.920]  time yeah I think it's funny when TSA pulls aside anybody who looks
[2:11:40.920 --> 2:11:46.000]  alternative lifestyle II like tattoos whatever because those folks are the least
[2:11:46.000 --> 2:11:50.600]  threat out there I mean a guy white guy in khakis I'm worried about because he
[2:11:50.600 --> 2:11:53.240]  may have nothing to live for and decide to kill himself and take a bunch of
[2:11:53.240 --> 2:11:55.400]  people with him just because he wants to be famous there's a lot of those guys in
[2:11:55.400 --> 2:11:59.880]  history but the guy with a lot of tattoos has sex to have where he's going
[2:11:59.880 --> 2:12:03.120]  has drugs to do he's not gonna kill anybody on the plane he wants to get
[2:12:03.120 --> 2:12:06.840]  where he's going to do the damage he's not gonna die mid-air that makes no
[2:12:06.840 --> 2:12:12.360]  sense yeah theoretically very al-Qaeda'sh yeah gentlemen tell us why you are here

[2:14:29.640 --> 2:14:33.880]  in when they kick Mubarak out in Egypt are you happy about the expansion of
[2:14:33.880 --> 2:14:38.800]  wars and torture I mean love peace I mean what's your view on Lord Obama or
[2:14:38.800 --> 2:14:42.480]  would that be heresy if you talk bad about it because you're both smart guys
[2:14:42.480 --> 2:14:45.720]  I mean you have you have courage howl talking about the 9-11 issue absolutely
[2:14:45.720 --> 2:14:52.480]  I I actually think in so far as politics in modern America and in any major
[2:14:52.480 --> 2:14:57.000]  advanced society you're gonna at least have to build some walls before you put
[2:14:57.000 --> 2:15:00.880]  the roof on and I think a lot of times policy wise we look for the roof first
[2:15:00.880 --> 2:15:04.680]  especially on the progressive side and we get ahead of ourselves and then we
[2:15:04.680 --> 2:15:08.360]  don't accomplish anything and and there and I think conservatives over time have
[2:15:08.360 --> 2:15:14.720]  have taken on a freeze America at a point in history that is anti-woman
[2:15:14.720 --> 2:15:20.840]  anti-minority anti-equality really and they're comfortable with that yeah
[2:15:20.840 --> 2:15:24.640]  women are doing real good right now well they're at their breast cancer is off
[2:15:24.640 --> 2:15:27.800]  the charts compared to well those vaccines are really helping so's the
[2:15:27.800 --> 2:15:31.520]  birth control of course they know it really increases the breast cancer but
[2:15:31.520 --> 2:15:34.040]  don't worry under health care they're gonna get to the free sizing agents in
[2:15:34.040 --> 2:15:37.640]  in drinking water the one of the big reasons why people have an increased
[2:15:37.640 --> 2:15:41.480]  amount of breast cancer in their system that's a big one yeah and hyper
[2:15:41.480 --> 2:15:47.340]  feminizes women and feminizes movement against clean drinking water since the
[2:15:47.340 --> 2:15:52.320]  1970s has actually driven more people to drink bottled water and that over time
[2:15:52.320 --> 2:15:55.640]  has read and led to a raise in that the paranoia about drinking your own tap
[2:15:55.640 --> 2:15:59.920]  water that's that's real that is honest to some degree I don't know if it's
[2:15:59.920 --> 2:16:03.000]  related directly to the fluoride aspect of things but the fact is that the
[2:16:03.000 --> 2:16:08.000]  anti-government kind of anti we're not all in this together group has been
[2:16:08.000 --> 2:16:12.000]  really against purifying the drinking water making sure it's actually clean so
[2:16:12.000 --> 2:16:14.760]  there's all these mitigators in the middle trying to keep you from being
[2:16:14.760 --> 2:16:18.200]  able to clean your water so everybody's like oh they're shitting water hold on
[2:16:18.200 --> 2:16:21.560]  hold on sorry there's crap in the tap water beg your pardon thank you guys we
[2:16:21.560 --> 2:16:24.840]  can't yeah we can't do that anymore because I have to delay it and they
[2:16:24.840 --> 2:16:28.920]  can listen no problem there's there's there's too much garbage in the tap
[2:16:28.920 --> 2:16:32.960]  water therefore it's better to drink bottled water and that drink that
[2:16:32.960 --> 2:16:36.120]  movement towards fear and towards bottled waters actually led to the higher
[2:16:36.120 --> 2:16:39.200]  cancer rates and I see how hell I'm gonna be honest with you that is
[2:16:39.200 --> 2:16:44.760]  completely insane what you just said so it is on record the sodium no I'm not
[2:16:44.760 --> 2:16:48.920]  debating this female a I know right I was called conspiracy theorist 10 years
[2:16:48.920 --> 2:16:51.880]  ago for talking about it I'm not debating it's mainly the stuff you
[2:16:51.880 --> 2:16:54.800]  microwave it's in the other plastic containers it's in everything but
[2:16:54.800 --> 2:16:57.920]  everything it's in our liners of ten hands sort of the sun what I'm telling
[2:16:57.920 --> 2:17:01.600]  you is because one thing's bad doesn't mean the other things good what I'm
[2:17:01.600 --> 2:17:05.520]  saying is it's on record and vice versa you know what sodium fluoride does to
[2:17:05.520 --> 2:17:09.000]  you yeah I'm not believe me I'm not a pro fluoride guy I'm saying that actually
[2:17:09.000 --> 2:17:12.480]  should be out of seven fold increase in bone cancer absolutely I'm what I'm
[2:17:12.480 --> 2:17:17.320]  saying is there was a movement in the 1970s where they're like H2O we need to
[2:17:17.320 --> 2:17:21.120]  clean the water as much as we can just base water no fluoride no nothing I
[2:17:21.120 --> 2:17:26.320]  agree and that got hammered largely by the rate what became the Reagan base in
[2:17:26.320 --> 2:17:29.440]  the 80s to a move towards you know what government should be out of the water
[2:17:29.440 --> 2:17:32.520]  business altogether and private industry moved in and started taking over
[2:17:32.520 --> 2:17:36.640]  utilities in mass in the 80s and then you get toilet a tap yeah absolutely and
[2:17:36.640 --> 2:17:41.880]  then so people in fear of that went to plastic bottled water the and then the
[2:17:41.880 --> 2:17:46.280]  cancer rate spiked directly related to that so yes I'm anti-fluoride and I
[2:17:46.280 --> 2:17:49.000]  don't think there should be anything in water but H2O that you would that you
[2:17:49.000 --> 2:17:52.880]  should come out of your tap as pure as possible the problem is this idea that
[2:17:52.880 --> 2:17:57.600]  hands off no EPA I don't want anybody you know no government bureaucrats the
[2:17:57.600 --> 2:18:01.800]  EPA that wants the fluoride in there well no I'm that now but there was a
[2:18:01.800 --> 2:18:05.840]  movement in the 70s for the EPA to be very pure but there once here's the
[2:18:05.840 --> 2:18:10.520]  thing you can't say an organization in government is bad inherently because
[2:18:10.520 --> 2:18:14.200]  it's been staffed by people who hate it to start well let me stop you're right
[2:18:14.200 --> 2:18:17.160]  there let me stop you're right there this is brown and you're all liberal
[2:18:17.160 --> 2:18:21.120]  conservative I'm way past all that I see what you're saying I over 90% does it
[2:18:21.120 --> 2:18:26.960]  not have worth over no no no over 90% of the EPA scientist in 2000 2005 and then
[2:18:26.960 --> 2:18:31.600]  again last year wrote letters to their bosses saying take the fluoride take the
[2:18:31.600 --> 2:18:34.600]  other toxins out of the water this is bad I know there were good people in
[2:18:34.600 --> 2:18:38.280]  government I know there's a lot of good people in government okay it's but
[2:18:38.280 --> 2:18:41.800]  they're compartmentalized it's the it's the directors on top absolutely the
[2:18:41.800 --> 2:18:43.740]  eugenesis because the well yeah and the committee
[2:18:43.740 --> 2:18:47.880]  chairmen's who make sure that that's who gets to the top of the organization the
[2:18:47.880 --> 2:18:51.680]  problem is when you have guys who are essentially inherently anti-government
[2:18:51.680 --> 2:18:54.240]  they have no impetus for a system to actually work to the benefit of the
[2:18:54.240 --> 2:19:00.200]  people and when you have a profit-based psychology in in both business and in
[2:19:00.200 --> 2:19:05.520]  government you you have only a monetary view of what profit totally it's more
[2:19:05.520 --> 2:19:09.840]  than that it's crony it's insiders run this is not free market in terms of cash
[2:19:09.840 --> 2:19:13.600]  profit and the profit of a country the profit that comes off the top what
[2:19:13.600 --> 2:19:17.640]  beyond what what a country takes in profit as it's busy talking about short
[2:19:17.640 --> 2:19:20.560]  term no I'm talking to her I mean they're doing
[2:19:20.560 --> 2:19:23.880]  short-term cash I'm talking about the health and happiness of the of the
[2:19:23.880 --> 2:19:27.400]  American people is the actual profit you make from your industry what we're
[2:19:27.400 --> 2:19:30.520]  what we look at is we have this is government industry it takes my taxes
[2:19:30.520 --> 2:19:34.120]  and it doesn't and it's it's always running at a deficit and on a cash level
[2:19:34.120 --> 2:19:39.280]  this is what we're saying it's based on we're saying like a femur or or or the
[2:19:39.280 --> 2:19:42.960]  EPA or any of these groups they're taking my tax laws and I don't know where
[2:19:42.960 --> 2:19:46.600]  it's going and I don't want it to I don't any benefit from it I don't see
[2:19:46.600 --> 2:19:49.800]  any benefit from it because it's taking my money not going away the benefit
[2:19:49.800 --> 2:19:52.720]  comes from the health and happiness of the American people the problem is you
[2:19:52.720 --> 2:19:57.160]  agree with you government makes the sunshine howl sparks is our guest Richard

[2:24:18.400 --> 2:24:23.400]  and we've got Hal Sparks who's been on every TV show in the galaxy but I think
[2:24:23.400 --> 2:24:26.520]  the biggest one is talk soup that's actually a show I've watched over the
[2:24:26.520 --> 2:24:29.840]  years whenever I do see it on and he was one of the better hosts of it okay so
[2:24:29.840 --> 2:24:33.240]  you're here in Austin Capsuley comedy club the next three nights let's get
[2:24:33.240 --> 2:24:36.600]  back to where we were Richard Hunter had a comment about quote the problem with
[2:24:36.600 --> 2:24:41.480]  the left my issue is I'm not into left and right I don't like these labels I
[2:24:41.480 --> 2:24:43.960]  don't like I'm gonna be for this issue from the right and this issue from the
[2:24:43.960 --> 2:24:50.160]  left I'm into common sense I'm into history I'm into freedom I'm part of
[2:24:50.160 --> 2:24:55.400]  the freedom group here here was the point on my own radio show in 2008 when
[2:24:55.400 --> 2:25:00.600]  we covered the presidential election I thought it was great to see so many
[2:25:00.600 --> 2:25:03.880]  young people get involved for the first time and all that sort of thing and
[2:25:03.880 --> 2:25:07.160]  they were a lot of my listeners but I'm somebody who's been politically active
[2:25:07.160 --> 2:25:10.480]  since I was 10 years old so I felt like I had something to say to these people and
[2:25:10.480 --> 2:25:14.160]  what I was trying to tell them was great that you got involved but the biggest
[2:25:14.160 --> 2:25:17.520]  mistake you're gonna make right now because you're new to the process is to
[2:25:17.520 --> 2:25:22.480]  say oh great my guy won I'll see you in four years my our work is done here oh
[2:25:22.480 --> 2:25:27.040]  contrary because this is the part where it gets really important don't don't you
[2:25:27.040 --> 2:25:30.320]  don't have to fall in love with Obama or anybody else for that matter as as a
[2:25:30.320 --> 2:25:34.120]  person understand that you're hiring them to do a job and they're gonna be
[2:25:34.120 --> 2:25:39.120]  exactly what you tell them to be or not be whatever you don't stay involved and
[2:25:39.120 --> 2:25:43.080]  if you don't tell them what you want they're going to listen to somebody else's
[2:25:43.080 --> 2:25:46.160]  special interest you made a great point about special interest what it really is
[2:25:46.160 --> 2:25:51.800]  is deciding whose special interest I can suffer more than someone else and
[2:25:51.800 --> 2:25:55.000]  there's these big roving gangs of corporate special interests that are
[2:25:55.000 --> 2:25:58.360]  bigger than most governments right and they're gonna buy Republican Democrats
[2:25:58.360 --> 2:26:03.600]  so how do you deal with them well ultimately you need giant government you
[2:26:03.600 --> 2:26:07.040]  don't even need big government you need government that is only about the big
[2:26:07.040 --> 2:26:11.320]  things protecting you from a giant country that's going to attack you large
[2:26:11.320 --> 2:26:14.600]  hurricanes those kind of that's the kind of government I'm interested in I don't
[2:26:14.600 --> 2:26:17.800]  need social architecture government I don't need government telling me how to
[2:26:17.800 --> 2:26:23.240]  live on a day-to-day basis per se but if a large corporation is putting up toxin
[2:26:23.240 --> 2:26:29.200]  in a in the food supply that's I needed a very large government's run by eugenicists
[2:26:29.200 --> 2:26:32.680]  that are actually putting the toxins in the food supply well I I wouldn't say
[2:26:32.680 --> 2:26:35.480]  everybody in the government's a eugenicist I mean I think that I think
[2:26:35.480 --> 2:26:50.000]  that's okay I I've watched most of these I'm sorry to say for free on the
[2:26:50.000 --> 2:26:55.440]  internet I know this is a great dollar industry really is always has been no
[2:26:55.440 --> 2:26:58.640]  wait a minute I give my stuff out for free and promoters free but we do have
[2:26:58.640 --> 2:27:02.040]  to find ourselves I know I get it back folks he's attacking the funding by the
[2:27:02.040 --> 2:27:06.520]  motion right now we're building the new TV studio over there yeah by a copy of
[2:27:06.520 --> 2:27:09.480]  Charmageddon and watch it before and after just so that you don't you know
[2:27:09.480 --> 2:27:13.200]  hold up in a bunker but they we're not hold up in a bunker we're storming the
[2:27:13.200 --> 2:27:17.360]  Texas Capitol why I wouldn't say we're out in the open we're taking America back
[2:27:17.360 --> 2:27:20.880]  you're in an unmarked building in an office park well that's because
[2:27:20.880 --> 2:27:24.920]  spanding that's because of amazing that's because of fans we have to get
[2:27:24.920 --> 2:27:31.320]  work done right and and they would interrupt they okay I don't doubt it
[2:27:31.320 --> 2:27:34.600]  because they have all kinds of like large loose-leaf binders full of stuff
[2:27:34.600 --> 2:27:38.320]  that you and also women have a hand and I say no but some of the crew has a
[2:27:38.320 --> 2:27:42.720]  problem oh yeah that's all right that explains the sales force here that I've
[2:27:42.720 --> 2:27:46.880]  seen a little too busy to sell anything no matter no matter your handing stuff
[2:27:46.880 --> 2:27:52.560]  out for free but I here's the thing I think that we start it's like anarchists
[2:27:52.560 --> 2:27:56.600]  with with the pre-printed anarchy t-shirts that you see all the time that
[2:27:56.600 --> 2:28:01.040]  the irony there in the constitutionalists who want to go pre-constitution to
[2:28:01.040 --> 2:28:06.240]  Wild West kind of mentality or even even fiefdom kind of stuff like that at a
[2:28:06.240 --> 2:28:09.560]  certain point we decided look we got all start getting together because up river
[2:28:09.560 --> 2:28:13.040]  somebody is dumping something into the water and we got to be able to stop that
[2:28:13.040 --> 2:28:17.520]  to some degree so we've got to become two towns then a state then multiple
[2:28:17.520 --> 2:28:23.600]  states because our our group future rests on everybody else I think the biggest
[2:28:23.600 --> 2:28:26.600]  problem right now with sort of the anti-government movement is that it's
[2:28:26.600 --> 2:28:30.280]  this states rights hyper local and everybody is just kind of going well
[2:28:30.280 --> 2:28:34.040]  whatever happens upstream is none of my business and the problem is it affects
[2:28:34.040 --> 2:28:37.720]  you it totally affects well the Soviets had the ultimate government and they
[2:28:37.720 --> 2:28:42.520]  were at every study much more toxic just throwing just throwing reactors in
[2:28:42.520 --> 2:28:45.800]  lakes they didn't have it the ultimate government they were good people no they
[2:28:45.800 --> 2:28:49.960]  had a they had a communist regime that and on face there was actually a
[2:28:49.960 --> 2:28:53.360]  manufactured monarchy basically they knocked the monarchy out of the way and
[2:28:53.360 --> 2:28:58.040]  then the communist party act same thing North Korea that's my point is that is
[2:28:58.040 --> 2:29:02.040]  that yeah I mean but that's that's a that's an issue with that country and
[2:29:02.040 --> 2:29:05.680]  yeah we elect our leaders or at least the the the perception has always been
[2:29:05.680 --> 2:29:09.200]  that we elect our leaders they that was you're talking about a time when they
[2:29:09.200 --> 2:29:12.600]  had no almost no interest in electing they would basically kill whoever was in
[2:29:12.600 --> 2:29:16.040]  charge of replacing with somebody who's just like him you know in England
[2:29:16.040 --> 2:29:21.840]  pre United Kingdom pre 1707 when you had England as a you know as a series of
[2:29:21.840 --> 2:29:24.760]  kingdoms basically would the peasants would eventually go we don't I'm sick of
[2:29:24.760 --> 2:29:28.280]  that guy telling me what to do and I'm sick of paying taxes this guy so I'm
[2:29:28.280 --> 2:29:31.480]  gonna we're all gonna storm the castle and throttle him that's what they would
[2:29:31.480 --> 2:29:34.600]  do they find whoever the Lord was drag him out of the castle string him up
[2:29:34.600 --> 2:29:40.520]  chuck him into a river and then not replace the social structure that he had
[2:29:40.520 --> 2:29:44.200]  created no they did with Magna Carta and then the parliament act you're wrong
[2:29:44.200 --> 2:29:47.160]  that at point that's stay there we gotta break we're coming back with both

[2:31:21.360 --> 2:31:26.600]  incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention for the
[2:31:26.600 --> 2:31:31.760]  Republic identifies the enemies of our nation the criminal offshore cartel held

[2:33:34.880 --> 2:33:39.480]  our guests we go to the drugs report today one of the top link stories DHS
[2:33:39.480 --> 2:33:44.480]  video characterizes white Americans as most likely terrorist and you know I
[2:33:44.480 --> 2:33:48.280]  have the my act and homeland security reports the police sent me that were
[2:33:48.280 --> 2:33:52.960]  big national news two years ago I've been to the urban warfare drills and there
[2:33:52.960 --> 2:33:56.800]  are white people there are black people there Hispanics that are roleplayers but
[2:33:56.800 --> 2:34:00.080]  they're saying I'm an American I have constitutional rights you're not taking
[2:34:00.080 --> 2:34:04.880]  my farm and I have this on video the trips practice mowing them down and I've
[2:34:04.880 --> 2:34:08.120]  gotten in the last three years a lot of these other documents where it says the
[2:34:08.120 --> 2:34:12.760]  number one threat is white males it's returning veterans it's Ron Paul
[2:34:12.760 --> 2:34:16.480]  supporters it's libertarians it's people that want to end the Federal
[2:34:16.480 --> 2:34:21.680]  Reserve and they're now putting these videos out which I agree with you said
[2:34:21.680 --> 2:34:25.880]  earlier that it's meant to you know sell black folks other people to to to to
[2:34:25.880 --> 2:34:29.600]  not notice that they're the ones really being targeted in Arabs so as you said
[2:34:29.600 --> 2:34:33.720]  pattern interrupt that's one layer but the other layer is they're training
[2:34:33.720 --> 2:34:37.480]  police everywhere and they're training even the Boy Scout Explorer clubs and
[2:34:37.480 --> 2:34:43.800]  the military to take on quote gun owning white rednecks they say that's the
[2:34:43.800 --> 2:34:46.920]  group that's gonna attack the government because look McVeigh did it you'll say
[2:34:46.920 --> 2:34:50.560]  well look he did I've got total proof the government stage that event so so I'm
[2:34:50.560 --> 2:34:54.640]  beyond all that my point is just like Hitler used an unpopular groups of
[2:34:54.640 --> 2:34:59.800]  communists and Jews first to beta test everything he was doing and the Germans
[2:34:59.800 --> 2:35:03.840]  were like get them then he flipped it around on everybody by the end that's
[2:35:03.840 --> 2:35:08.080]  my point what is your take on that ultimately the the video the DHS is
[2:35:08.080 --> 2:35:10.760]  putting up the reason I think they're now using white people is because the
[2:35:10.760 --> 2:35:15.440]  automatic assumption that anybody who's a threat is brown has led to security
[2:35:15.440 --> 2:35:18.480]  breaches or the potential for potential for security breaches because they're
[2:35:18.480 --> 2:35:21.800]  automatically their own pattern is why would I look at a white guy that's not
[2:35:21.800 --> 2:35:25.920]  who my enemy is but then you have it let's say you have a Muslim extremist
[2:35:25.920 --> 2:35:30.440]  organization in al Qaeda-ish group for real and you know a real Easter Bunny
[2:35:30.440 --> 2:35:34.580]  right exactly well let's say you know it's a real Santa Claus right sorry they
[2:35:34.580 --> 2:35:38.720]  don't know it's not a real garden no it's not a real real toothberry it right
[2:35:38.720 --> 2:35:43.360]  a toothberry yeah he's one of the scariest creatures in childhood you
[2:35:43.360 --> 2:35:47.040]  haven't seen a toothberry no it's horrible yeah and the crunchy and yet no
[2:35:47.040 --> 2:35:50.800]  nutritional value entirely made of enamel and hanging the tree is fray captain
[2:35:50.800 --> 2:35:56.000]  crunch yeah right the some other mythical creatures let's say unicorns
[2:35:56.000 --> 2:36:00.120]  leprechauns right okay so what I'm saying is you're at one point saying there
[2:36:00.120 --> 2:36:03.520]  is no al Qaeda threat there's no this is a manufactured thing there are no
[2:36:03.520 --> 2:36:07.320]  Muslims come extremists coming with strap bombs to go on a USA airways
[2:36:07.320 --> 2:36:12.680]  flight from Vegas to Idaho I there may be some and but in other cases it's
[2:36:12.680 --> 2:36:16.480]  confirmed the feds are getting mentally ill patsy's on planes oh and they got
[2:36:16.480 --> 2:36:20.120]  butala on the plane that's admitted here ruling here okay so ruling with no
[2:36:20.120 --> 2:36:24.840]  passport US government got him on right here's the here's the thing if if you
[2:36:24.840 --> 2:36:28.240]  have TSA and their habit is every time you you test them no matter how much
[2:36:28.240 --> 2:36:32.400]  how many times you tell them there are there all there's these nine people are
[2:36:32.400 --> 2:36:35.360]  actual threats I don't mean manufactured I don't mean I mean genuine
[2:36:35.360 --> 2:36:38.880]  psychopaths who rode roam around you've got somewhere in the order of what a
[2:36:38.880 --> 2:36:43.200]  hundred million airline passengers a year flying in the air there's what is
[2:36:43.200 --> 2:36:46.920]  one in 78 people are legitimately psychotic you know that's like saying
[2:36:46.920 --> 2:36:50.640]  somebody might rob your house so we got to put arm guards in it the world didn't
[2:36:50.640 --> 2:36:53.720]  say no it isn't because your house isn't gonna fall out of the sky and land on
[2:36:53.720 --> 2:36:56.440]  other people or kill other people who aren't there the idea that the
[2:36:56.440 --> 2:37:00.800]  government must guarantee our safety is the absolute road to bondage okay but
[2:37:00.800 --> 2:37:05.080]  the idea that give me an airport give me an air company with no security and I'll
[2:37:05.080 --> 2:37:08.920]  guarantee you they're gonna make so much money like I want to accept the danger
[2:37:08.920 --> 2:37:14.480]  okay great I want it I want freedom right 1776 not an anti-state right but
[2:37:14.480 --> 2:37:19.200]  then the plane lands on somebody it's not a house see it's all communal now we
[2:37:19.200 --> 2:37:22.000]  have socialist health care so the government's gonna tell you what you can
[2:37:22.000 --> 2:37:26.400]  eat because we're now all tied up don't the guy in your health oh the plane might
[2:37:26.400 --> 2:37:31.040]  fall on somebody so we gotta have a proctology exam a six-year-old girl right
[2:37:31.040 --> 2:37:36.040]  it oh the government or terrorist break your condition and you're the one with
[2:37:36.040 --> 2:37:38.720]  the conditioning you're the one repeating the same market look here's the
[2:37:38.720 --> 2:37:42.240]  thing they're the one stage in the terror got you okay so they're the one
[2:37:42.240 --> 2:37:46.160]  stage in the terror as a human they're the one stage in the terror I as the
[2:37:46.160 --> 2:37:50.440]  person who actually wants a valuable society around me okay I don't give a
[2:37:50.440 --> 2:37:54.880]  shit about getting good again we can't do it one more time I'm saying third time
[2:37:54.880 --> 2:37:58.800]  and I'm out I can't I can't I get it all right you can't debate me with actual
[2:37:58.800 --> 2:38:02.400]  intellectual words I can't debate you when you're not allowing me to talk I
[2:38:02.400 --> 2:38:06.680]  agree that's true go ahead don't be good I'm winning what I'm saying I'm winning
[2:38:06.680 --> 2:38:09.680]  you're not you're not getting mad he's getting mad you get allowed to go ahead
[2:38:09.680 --> 2:38:13.000]  no it's your show you'll always have you have this silver mic look at this they
[2:38:13.000 --> 2:38:15.720]  could turn this thing off at any moment that's actually a better mic the problem
[2:38:15.720 --> 2:38:19.760]  is on one front it wasn't cuz I swore this is a conspiracy those people at
[2:38:19.760 --> 2:38:23.040]  home who heard those missing spots it was cuz I said this is not just this is
[2:38:23.040 --> 2:38:28.560]  not just XM no I know I can't do it you can okay here's the thing do you I was
[2:38:28.560 --> 2:38:33.520]  mainly joking around you look genuinely angry do you believe in any in any
[2:38:33.520 --> 2:38:38.160]  governmental protections police fire that kind of stuff do you or is it all
[2:38:38.160 --> 2:38:42.200]  volunteer I do believe that it's at all volunteer we're doing that lawyer tactic
[2:38:42.200 --> 2:38:46.280]  you're not letting me answer and you're continuing with your debate I believe in
[2:38:46.280 --> 2:38:50.300]  constitutionally I believe in constitutionally limited government
[2:38:50.300 --> 2:38:54.740]  and and obviously we've got too much government right now okay here's the
[2:38:54.740 --> 2:38:59.060]  government's adding jobs the private sector laying them off you're losing the
[2:38:59.060 --> 2:39:02.760]  private sector do you believe losing the private sector now we're not could
[2:39:02.760 --> 2:39:05.820]  you believe in we're not losing the private sector do you believe in
[2:39:05.820 --> 2:39:09.280]  constitutionally limited corporations that corporations are less than
[2:39:09.280 --> 2:39:13.380]  governments yes yes I do believe that corporations especially when the
[2:39:13.380 --> 2:39:17.700]  multinational and pay no taxes right are not alive and are not people I think
[2:39:17.700 --> 2:39:20.320]  it's okay if somebody wants to incorporate for their particular local
[2:39:20.320 --> 2:39:24.740]  small project but I am against mega corporations okay great at what point does
[2:39:24.740 --> 2:39:28.900]  a small government able to compete with a mega corporation because you're gonna
[2:39:28.900 --> 2:39:32.380]  have an either or ultimately if you if you cut the size of government the
[2:39:32.380 --> 2:39:36.060]  mega corporations aren't gonna be able to siphon the wealth of mega mega
[2:39:36.060 --> 2:39:39.540]  corporations get their profit from government they roll no they don't they
[2:39:39.540 --> 2:39:43.620]  roll into local areas and suck all the resources out this isn't a problem with
[2:39:43.620 --> 2:39:46.740]  a resource-based economy that's where mega corporations get their stuff it's
[2:39:46.740 --> 2:39:49.740]  not from inventing or creating appliances something that you have to
[2:39:49.740 --> 2:39:54.820]  actually compete with other people it's oil it's sugar it's cocoa it's orange
[2:39:54.820 --> 2:39:58.340]  juice and these people roll in actually more and more of the corporations make
[2:39:58.340 --> 2:40:02.780]  their profit off of government contracts but listen I agree with the only other
[2:40:02.780 --> 2:40:06.060]  issue let's just go back and be sure you're milkshake and you let let's go back
[2:40:06.060 --> 2:40:09.580]  to be serious let's go back here though let's talk about we're more afraid of
[2:40:09.580 --> 2:40:12.780]  the government and you're afraid of somebody like BP sucking the water not
[2:40:12.780 --> 2:40:17.300]  the oil I said BP should go to prison from it right now t-boon pickings in the
[2:40:17.300 --> 2:40:22.940]  water I agree Texas while trying to while trying to get no while trying to
[2:40:22.940 --> 2:40:27.180]  get cities to pass laws because shut down their water supplies so he makes
[2:40:27.180 --> 2:40:31.580]  more to create our business don't have the fight back hundred comments yes
[2:40:31.580 --> 2:40:38.180]  can I can I interject of a thought here a general feeling that I have you're
[2:40:38.180 --> 2:40:45.700]  not getting my guns a general a general feeling that you're actually scared I
[2:40:45.700 --> 2:40:49.500]  want your guns so the joke is based in your actual fear base well I mean the
[2:40:49.500 --> 2:40:53.460]  average Democrat does want my gun no I don't you go mama's for gun vans knowing
[2:40:53.460 --> 2:41:00.500]  his is telling you guys tell me what's wrong with this idea I have a general
[2:41:00.500 --> 2:41:06.740]  feeling that the the only people I'm not going to allow you to fist fight the
[2:41:06.740 --> 2:41:11.180]  only people that I dislike completely understand inherent distrust of
[2:41:11.180 --> 2:41:15.340]  government and corrupt elected officials the only people that I made
[2:41:15.340 --> 2:41:22.540]  distrust more are our for-profit private privately owned CEOs because there is
[2:41:22.540 --> 2:41:27.540]  more money to be made in the private sector what about that yeah I think in
[2:41:27.540 --> 2:41:31.940]  game as a green is that fair made by a private CEO of a local corporation and
[2:41:31.940 --> 2:41:36.780]  printed on Chinese plastic and and distributed by a machine that's
[2:41:36.780 --> 2:41:41.100]  actually made with Chinese components in a what about your DVD you plugged out
[2:41:41.100 --> 2:41:44.260]  of the gates on Amazon oh yeah but I don't have any problem with that part of
[2:41:44.260 --> 2:41:48.660]  it I actually speak Chinese and travel over there so see yeah this is a liberal
[2:41:48.660 --> 2:41:52.260]  dirty tricks folks I'm not supposed to be able to sell books and videos to get my
[2:41:52.260 --> 2:41:56.540]  message out now no no I can I ask you though about he took it all personal
[2:41:56.540 --> 2:42:00.860]  okay can I ask you are you wearing women's underwear about what you think
[2:42:00.860 --> 2:42:07.260]  one and three guys is allowed to so yeah I would ask you what I what I what you
[2:42:07.260 --> 2:42:10.500]  think about what I said because I completely understand distrust of
[2:42:10.500 --> 2:42:14.380]  government I'm just saying that I probably fear government is a tool of
[2:42:14.380 --> 2:42:17.940]  the corporations right but yeah absolutely I fear corporations your
[2:42:17.940 --> 2:42:20.900]  issue then but I yeah if we eliminate the movie you think you're in here with
[2:42:20.900 --> 2:42:24.140]  Ronald Reagan in this interview you're not know if I fear if we eliminate the
[2:42:24.140 --> 2:42:28.060]  middleman though I fear what's behind the curtain even more which is the for
[2:42:28.060 --> 2:42:32.500]  profit CEO oh no no no no they're there they have government power they've
[2:42:32.500 --> 2:42:35.820]  gotten the government to vote and here's an example they take your roads
[2:42:35.820 --> 2:42:39.300]  over existing ones put tolls on it you pay for and then get a government bail
[2:42:39.300 --> 2:42:43.060]  out which we learn that Center of Spain does everywhere it's a scam which is a
[2:42:43.060 --> 2:42:47.860]  states rights act that's that's local states rights that's Texas handing over
[2:42:47.860 --> 2:42:52.460]  their basically a federally created by the way federal tax dollars building the
[2:42:52.460 --> 2:42:55.260]  federal highway system and then Texas decides you know what we're gonna hand
[2:42:55.260 --> 2:42:58.820]  over our toll roads and our major throughways that were made that's right
[2:42:58.820 --> 2:43:03.700]  and Bush had to sign an executive order to block the federal law to let Perry do
[2:43:03.700 --> 2:43:09.180]  it right and but that's you're arguing for I mean states can be evil feds can
[2:43:09.180 --> 2:43:12.300]  be right I agree but at least supposed to be a balance between the feds in the
[2:43:12.300 --> 2:43:15.020]  states it's getting out of control it's supposed to be our local state and
[2:43:15.020 --> 2:43:19.980]  federal government against corporations and foreign actors against us on on one
[2:43:19.980 --> 2:43:24.180]  level and the protection of an actual social structure where we can get where
[2:43:24.180 --> 2:43:27.820]  we need to be street lights and the like on the way vaccines where do you stand
[2:43:27.820 --> 2:43:32.620]  on vaccines I don't take them I think I think that's not very trendy well you
[2:43:32.620 --> 2:43:35.980]  seem to have this grouping of Democrats and liberals like we're all the same
[2:43:35.980 --> 2:43:39.660]  here with me it's a joke about your guns and I don't take the vaccines and I
[2:43:39.660 --> 2:43:43.740]  don't drink bottled water as best I can and I let me stop you for just a minute
[2:43:43.740 --> 2:43:46.660]  and because I want to spend some time with you guys when and you're all at
[2:43:46.660 --> 2:43:50.980]  the cap city comic club tonight the next two nights here in Austin Texas it's
[2:43:50.980 --> 2:43:54.780]  very evil they have Chinese made carpet there now now continuing it's a joke
[2:43:54.780 --> 2:43:59.580]  folks I like cap city comedy club right you know I'm the only guy out there
[2:43:59.580 --> 2:44:03.740]  known who puts my films out free on the internet immediately I travel that's not
[2:44:03.740 --> 2:44:10.460]  true there's a site called XTube no no I've been doing this for 16 years though
[2:44:10.460 --> 2:44:14.500]  I know and that's why I was watching you but this wasn't a plan of mine to be
[2:44:14.500 --> 2:44:18.100]  six I wanted to be successful in the message and and and and this is a
[2:44:18.100 --> 2:44:21.460]  blend back man there's money to be made in freaking people out whether you're
[2:44:21.460 --> 2:44:25.700]  right or not is I mean ultimately like Obama saying you better raise the debt
[2:44:25.700 --> 2:44:30.500]  ceiling or no social security I mean that's absolutely enough enough of all
[2:44:30.500 --> 2:44:34.500]  that I want to get into real material gentlemen first Richard Hunter your view
[2:44:34.500 --> 2:44:38.460]  on 9-11 I mean if the government was involved or let it happen the point is
[2:44:38.460 --> 2:44:42.140]  these people need to be removed all right and both parties are involved and the
[2:44:42.140 --> 2:44:44.620]  former head of homeland security minute that issue terror learns for political
[2:44:44.620 --> 2:44:50.380]  purposes does that concern you yes there are elements of 9-11 building 7 etc I
[2:44:50.380 --> 2:44:53.420]  look at it like the Kennedy assassination I don't have a definitive
[2:44:53.420 --> 2:44:57.260]  theory that I'm comfortable with to tell you who I think was exactly behind the
[2:44:57.260 --> 2:45:00.820]  Kennedy assassination but I will tell you without a doubt that it was no lone
[2:45:00.820 --> 2:45:05.340]  gunman so I also and that's you know how 40 something years removed from that
[2:45:05.340 --> 2:45:09.980]  we're even closer in time to 9-11 so I don't think it's even possible I do to
[2:45:09.980 --> 2:45:15.300]  say exactly what was behind it but I think it's absolutely right to question
[2:45:15.300 --> 2:45:20.180]  and look at it from every angle I think the value of the 9-11 truth movement
[2:45:20.180 --> 2:45:24.140]  would be that it's all about the most truthful information that comes out
[2:45:24.140 --> 2:45:28.300]  once you start drawing conclusions of your own based on any dog you might
[2:45:28.300 --> 2:45:33.180]  have in the race ultimately you you help the the sort of the governmental
[2:45:33.180 --> 2:45:36.260]  architecture version of things by either being viewed as for or against it
[2:45:36.260 --> 2:45:41.740]  whereas you can just go look there is no way building 7 burn down nobody looks at
[2:45:41.740 --> 2:45:45.660]  it and thinks that for a second so let's I want to know exactly what happened
[2:45:45.660 --> 2:45:49.700]  and until I know exactly what happened I'm not gonna rest and I also don't I'm
[2:45:49.700 --> 2:45:53.740]  not gonna draw any conclusions let you bait me into oh it was you know George
[2:45:53.740 --> 2:45:56.300]  Bush having breakfast with the bin Laden's on the morning of the thing which
[2:45:56.300 --> 2:46:00.500]  you know which well that's one in Guardian right which I bet and when all
[2:46:00.500 --> 2:46:04.140]  air traffic was shut down five different flights flying the bin Laden's out of the
[2:46:04.140 --> 2:46:08.500]  country totally but they got caught lying about it right no well ignore all
[2:46:08.500 --> 2:46:13.100]  that you blown my voice out there there's a problem though that it's so big
[2:46:13.100 --> 2:46:18.100]  that that's how they keep us from compartmentalizing one mystery at a time
[2:46:18.100 --> 2:46:22.060]  right maybe that's the way to it to attack it is to look at nothing but
[2:46:22.060 --> 2:46:25.740]  building seven I'm bigger something out of something's wrong with that the
[2:46:25.740 --> 2:46:28.100]  whole thing shot yeah whatever you whenever you're trying to prosecute a
[2:46:28.100 --> 2:46:31.580]  criminal if you try to go after that criminal before you're you have evidence
[2:46:31.580 --> 2:46:36.180]  in that's offered in court you go we'll find the evidence as we go along but I
[2:46:36.180 --> 2:46:40.060]  know that guy's guilty he'll always walk and that's the problem and I know the
[2:46:40.060 --> 2:46:43.700]  building seven is the bloody axe in the back of the trunk that matches the blood
[2:46:43.700 --> 2:46:46.540]  of the dead woman they found that's true and building seven is the bloody axe
[2:46:46.540 --> 2:46:49.940]  that's true so it's enough to start the investigation I believe it's absolutely
[2:46:49.940 --> 2:46:54.460]  but but ultimately it's the start of it but in the truth movement and have if it
[2:46:54.460 --> 2:47:00.340]  has any value is the dogged search for the actual video of what hit the Pentagon
[2:47:00.340 --> 2:47:05.100]  the you know the the towers themselves any footage that was done before you know
[2:47:05.100 --> 2:47:09.300]  other than what was released as it were you need as much of it as possible so
[2:47:09.300 --> 2:47:12.420]  that it overwhelms the psychological effect of people not being able to
[2:47:12.420 --> 2:47:15.820]  believe sure how let me ask you this question this is a serious question I
[2:47:15.820 --> 2:47:19.540]  want to get in the fight again and that was fun my voice can't handle it now I
[2:47:19.540 --> 2:47:24.700]  know that's how I get you yeah well ever long if you go back though I
[2:47:24.700 --> 2:47:27.700]  understand counterbalancing three branches of government government
[2:47:27.700 --> 2:47:31.420]  counterbalancing corporations and counterbalancing robber barons I get
[2:47:31.420 --> 2:47:35.580]  all that that's actually constitutional mm-hmm what I'm saying is who deals with
[2:47:35.580 --> 2:47:38.940]  the federal government when it goes bad and corporations put all their
[2:47:38.940 --> 2:47:43.140]  operatives in every position via revolving door when the government at
[2:47:43.140 --> 2:47:46.940]  the highest levels is covering up 9-11 which we know they're doing then who
[2:47:46.940 --> 2:47:51.260]  deals with the federal government well ultimately if in a democracy
[2:47:51.260 --> 2:47:54.420]  theoretically the voters would the problem is electronic voting machines
[2:47:54.420 --> 2:47:58.420]  right yeah well that I'm not and it's confirmed in Ohio no question no question
[2:47:58.420 --> 2:48:02.580]  electronic voting machines no paper trail is a direct affront to a democracy
[2:48:02.580 --> 2:48:06.340]  there's no question about that we're completely on the same page in that area
[2:48:06.340 --> 2:48:10.500]  but ultimately regardless of those elements the voters actually have the
[2:48:10.500 --> 2:48:15.300]  opportunity to do that that's that's our only service point that's you know our
[2:48:15.300 --> 2:48:18.860]  our only way into it the problem is from a corporate point of view trying to
[2:48:18.860 --> 2:48:24.100]  control 500 congress people congress critters you know is is very expensive
[2:48:24.100 --> 2:48:27.820]  and a pain in the butt and it requires a lot of local maneuver controlling a
[2:48:27.820 --> 2:48:32.900]  hundred senators even more expensive because they hold giant districts and
[2:48:32.900 --> 2:48:36.500]  I'm competing with other corporate interests in that thing but the Supreme
[2:48:36.500 --> 2:48:42.420]  Court is a way better use of my money as a corporate controller if I get people
[2:48:42.420 --> 2:48:46.580]  in there who are corporatists running the Scalia's and the Roberts of the
[2:48:46.580 --> 2:48:49.460]  world the Clarence Thomas who will follow anything behind there and that's why
[2:48:49.460 --> 2:48:53.500]  the president's okay because with the presidency you get the court yeah yeah
[2:48:53.500 --> 2:48:56.140]  yeah ultimately that's what you're shooting for I mean you got you got to
[2:48:56.140 --> 2:48:59.620]  look at it you know Mitt Romney for example who's arguably the front runner
[2:48:59.620 --> 2:49:02.420]  for the Republican side going this guy okay you should love him he wrote
[2:49:02.420 --> 2:49:08.380]  Obamacare no that I believe me I'm for a general flopper yeah he's an
[2:49:08.380 --> 2:49:13.180]  amazing body of what about Rick Perry right Al Gore's former chief of staff in
[2:49:13.180 --> 2:49:17.980]  Texas forced inoculations NAFTA superhighway power grabs right I mean
[2:49:17.980 --> 2:49:22.900]  this guy is about as conservative he's the guy who is the guy who one he's like
[2:49:22.900 --> 2:49:26.860]  the guy in the club who's going this place stinks I hate this dump this is
[2:49:26.860 --> 2:49:30.340]  ridiculous I'm leaving I want to see your manager this is pathetic this is
[2:49:30.340 --> 2:49:33.140]  terrible service sir let me see these manner are you the manager you guys
[2:49:33.140 --> 2:49:37.060]  hiring because that's really what he's doing he's arguing for secession and
[2:49:37.060 --> 2:49:41.180]  then now he wants to run for president I hate this United States part so much
[2:49:41.180 --> 2:49:45.140]  that I want to run for the the whole of it it's absurd but the point is Mitt
[2:49:45.140 --> 2:49:47.740]  Romney is going to be the guy arguably because they're pushing into the front
[2:49:47.740 --> 2:49:50.780]  evangelicals won't vote for him because he's Mormon they'll pair him with an
[2:49:50.780 --> 2:49:53.540]  evangelical try and balance that vote out it'll never happen they're bringing
[2:49:53.540 --> 2:49:59.380]  Perry in but yeah but he won't he won't fare any better you think because it's
[2:49:59.380 --> 2:50:02.060]  you know we we've got to get another Texan egg as it's already been three
[2:50:02.060 --> 2:50:06.580]  years since we had one right he did so well but the angle here is Obama people
[2:50:06.580 --> 2:50:09.940]  thought he would fix everything so quickly that you fix it I think people I
[2:50:09.940 --> 2:50:14.620]  think people are gonna run back over to a mutate a big wig Republicans they did
[2:50:14.620 --> 2:50:18.500]  it I said this two years ago Rick Perry they did it in 2010 the run back he has
[2:50:18.500 --> 2:50:23.180]  knelt before build a burden that I don't doubt but the 2010 vote was them
[2:50:23.180 --> 2:50:26.720]  running back to the other side and you've got Bainer and Cantor in charge of
[2:50:26.720 --> 2:50:29.940]  things and these guys are corporates of the high door highest order Mitt Romney
[2:50:29.940 --> 2:50:34.740]  is the guy who old-school corporates rolls in buys up a company a local
[2:50:34.740 --> 2:50:39.020]  company run by a local CEO buys it up hey since we got you guys in here sends it
[2:50:39.020 --> 2:50:41.860]  overseas the first 30 minutes was nothing but screaming and yelling you
[2:50:41.860 --> 2:50:45.420]  guys want to do 20 minutes overdrive so we can take phone calls I love it now

[2:55:13.900 --> 2:55:17.460]  again the websites are info wars dot com prison planet dot com our guest sites
[2:55:17.460 --> 2:55:22.300]  our house sparks dot com and Richard hunter show dot com and I want Richard to
[2:55:22.300 --> 2:55:26.260]  get a chance to pop in and talk here some Richard howl says he's seen in game
[2:55:26.260 --> 2:55:30.620]  yeah blueprint for global enslavement I brought that up and I said look you have
[2:55:30.620 --> 2:55:34.260]  debates about whether government's good or not or how big it should be I've done
[2:55:34.260 --> 2:55:38.300]  a study of these people and the dominant Western powers they made a deal with China
[2:55:38.300 --> 2:55:42.700]  on this and they have a lot of excuses of why it's good there is a giant covert
[2:55:42.700 --> 2:55:46.660]  world population reduction program going on do you guys think a that that's
[2:55:46.660 --> 2:55:56.020]  going on or I'm lying or B is it a good idea yeah it's it is it going on you
[2:55:56.020 --> 2:56:00.220]  know I don't know I mean I think one thing that I think is so important
[2:56:00.220 --> 2:56:03.820]  about these conversations is that nothing is off the table I don't I don't
[2:56:03.820 --> 2:56:08.700]  hear anything just on premise and go oh you're crazy right don't tell me that our
[2:56:08.700 --> 2:56:12.860]  government you one need only look as far as the Tuskegee experiments to know
[2:56:12.860 --> 2:56:18.940]  that the the U.S. federal government is doing is capable of doing something very
[2:56:18.940 --> 2:56:22.420]  well specifically people with that's an understatement absolutely so I don't
[2:56:22.420 --> 2:56:27.380]  think there's any I think it's it's key to the question my my I guess my issue
[2:56:27.380 --> 2:56:31.420]  with it all is with with sort of an all-or-nothing approach you know drown
[2:56:31.420 --> 2:56:35.460]  federal government in a bathtub or blow it up so big that it's in control of
[2:56:35.460 --> 2:56:39.980]  everything both of those perspectives the answer is informed involved people and
[2:56:39.980 --> 2:56:43.820]  Thomas Everson said right educate the general public about you know facts and
[2:56:43.820 --> 2:56:48.140]  science and information and tyranny will vanish like phantoms at dawn but yeah and
[2:56:48.140 --> 2:56:50.540]  that's why they undercut the Department of Education that's why you don't want
[2:56:50.540 --> 2:56:54.340]  the department it's the US education was a lot better before we had that I've had
[2:56:54.340 --> 2:56:58.380]  the former was I've had the former had a policy Charlotte is or beyond she was
[2:56:58.380 --> 2:57:02.140]  there in the 80s and they had a program in the Department of Education to dump
[2:57:02.140 --> 2:57:06.660]  people down but there's got to be happy that's the 80s mentality of the
[2:57:06.660 --> 2:57:09.500]  Ronald Reagan's of the world they hated that they hate big government
[2:57:09.500 --> 2:57:12.940]  organizations so you run the government Oregon organization you don't like into
[2:57:12.940 --> 2:57:16.540]  the ground no no no it was you know it was science yeah she released the
[2:57:16.540 --> 2:57:19.860]  documents this was going on decades before her to yeah but say this is a
[2:57:19.860 --> 2:57:23.140]  dumb people that's the existence of the Department of Education is the
[2:57:23.140 --> 2:57:27.820]  negative instead of using it properly that you think a centralized educating
[2:57:27.820 --> 2:57:32.300]  system is a good idea not I think a standard of intelligence in Thomas
[2:57:32.300 --> 2:57:36.300]  Jefferson was trained at home but here's Abraham Lincoln was trained at home
[2:57:36.300 --> 2:57:39.540]  right chocrates and Alexander the Great were trained and what he came up with
[2:57:39.540 --> 2:57:43.420]  eventually was the common good with that we should actually provide for the
[2:57:43.420 --> 2:57:46.940]  education and welfare of the country this was that's what he came to is that I
[2:57:46.940 --> 2:57:50.700]  was lucky I had people at home that would teach me but you might not and
[2:57:50.700 --> 2:57:52.700]  you're not getting you're getting half the information and all this the
[2:57:52.700 --> 2:57:56.100]  our theocratic nonsense and I'm having to deal with you in open business yeah
[2:57:56.100 --> 2:58:00.060]  like like like environmental brainwashing telling five-year-olds about
[2:58:00.060 --> 2:58:03.020]  different types of sex they shouldn't even be talking about that it should be
[2:58:03.020 --> 2:58:07.100]  reading, writing, and arithmetic but doesn't there have to be a science but they inject
[2:58:07.100 --> 2:58:11.420]  whatever they can for social training and social engineering in school instead
[2:58:11.420 --> 2:58:14.140]  of reading, writing, and arithmetic but doesn't there have to be a hybrid of that
[2:58:14.140 --> 2:58:18.340]  because if there's not that's how things like Jim Crow laws are allowed to
[2:58:18.340 --> 2:58:22.500]  exist I mean if you completely deregulate and you leave people up to
[2:58:22.500 --> 2:58:26.220]  their own state-to-state devices which in some instances I'm in favor of I'm
[2:58:26.220 --> 2:58:29.620]  just saying if you totally pull the federal government out of it then that
[2:58:29.620 --> 2:58:33.780]  is how you get black people not being allowed to eat at a diner right and if
[2:58:33.780 --> 2:58:37.140]  you have a bunch of kids who aren't their only experience of- hold on we'll talk
[2:58:37.140 --> 2:58:40.500]  more about that we got to go to break back in 60 seconds going into overdrive
[2:58:40.500 --> 2:58:43.540]  main transmissions over

[2:58:50.700 --> 2:58:54.580]  this is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a
[2:58:54.580 --> 2:58:58.900]  solar powered generator number one new climate legislation could easily double
[2:58:58.900 --> 2:59:03.100]  or triple your electric bill number two our new energies are wants to control
[2:59:03.100 --> 2:59:07.140]  how much power your electric company allows you to have it's true total
[2:59:07.140 --> 2:59:11.020]  government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is
[2:59:11.020 --> 2:59:15.100]  coming number three in some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously
[2:59:15.100 --> 2:59:19.460]  overloaded and now new socialist legislation is only compounding the
[2:59:19.460 --> 2:59:23.780]  problem number four dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids every
[2:59:23.780 --> 2:59:27.500]  year thousands of families lose their power from weather related onages number
[2:59:27.500 --> 2:59:31.700]  five a solar powered generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of
[2:59:31.700 --> 2:59:35.060]  mind folks I really believe in the solar powered generators offered by solution

[2:59:51.860 --> 2:59:58.660]  coast to coast direct from Austin you're listening to the Alex Jones broadcasting
[2:59:58.660 --> 3:00:24.340]  network network
[3:00:24.340 --> 3:00:37.020]  We are now into our number four today, we're going to retransmission with our big top
[3:00:37.020 --> 3:00:41.900]  story that's gone viral all over the internet, this will get read by five million people
[3:00:41.900 --> 3:00:42.900]  today.
[3:00:42.900 --> 3:00:47.900]  DHS video characterizes white Americans as most likely terrorists, you got to see it
[3:00:47.900 --> 3:00:49.420]  to believe it.
[3:00:49.420 --> 3:00:57.060]  We have a TV host, comedian, he's not at all talk soup, you name it, with us, Hal Sparks
[3:00:57.060 --> 3:01:01.340]  we've also got Richard Hunter with us for this short segment and the next long segment
[3:01:01.340 --> 3:01:06.500]  and we're going to your phone calls right now, Mike in New York, you are on the air,
[3:01:06.500 --> 3:01:07.500]  welcome.
[3:01:07.500 --> 3:01:10.140]  Yeah, thanks for taking my call man.
[3:01:10.140 --> 3:01:13.140]  Welcome, so do you have any questions or comments for our guest or what's your statement?
[3:01:13.140 --> 3:01:18.300]  Yeah, I'd like to talk briefly about the 10th anniversary of 9-11 coming up.
[3:01:18.300 --> 3:01:19.300]  Sure, go ahead.
[3:01:19.300 --> 3:01:24.540]  A couple buddies and I are just trying to raise some awareness, we put together a video,
[3:01:24.540 --> 3:01:28.860]  a website with some flyers out there in conjunction with We Got Change, just trying to get as
[3:01:28.860 --> 3:01:34.700]  many people out to ground zero on the 11th as possible, I truly think this is a big one
[3:01:34.700 --> 3:01:35.700]  for 10th anniversary.
[3:01:35.700 --> 3:01:41.340]  Yeah, so the government can't just use the deaths again to sell us turning America into
[3:01:41.340 --> 3:01:46.380]  a giant prison, Mike I appreciate your call, you guys got any comments on how, regardless
[3:01:46.380 --> 3:01:50.300]  of what happened with 9-11, how it's been used to transform our society?
[3:01:50.300 --> 3:01:56.460]  Yeah, I think it's always easy to use even genuine crimes and I don't think this was
[3:01:56.460 --> 3:02:02.100]  what it was presented as, but let's say there really is a serial killer on the loose.
[3:02:02.100 --> 3:02:07.420]  It's great opportunity to act on that fact and make everybody afraid to live and interact,
[3:02:07.420 --> 3:02:13.940]  so you destroy social structures that might be in front of large, and I think it's local
[3:02:13.940 --> 3:02:19.380]  constabularies and corporatists, you can cut those apart by making people more afraid
[3:02:19.380 --> 3:02:26.380]  to interact, and I think 9-11 needs something along the lines of what Anonymous is doing.
[3:02:26.380 --> 3:02:30.340]  When I was in England, there was a great moment where they had this anti-scientology kind
[3:02:30.340 --> 3:02:36.940]  of move over there, and these guys showed up at the Scientology Center in London wearing
[3:02:36.940 --> 3:02:41.180]  the V for Vendetta masks, and an army of them showed up.
[3:02:41.180 --> 3:02:46.340]  It was amazing to watch, and the news had to cover it just because it was entertaining.
[3:02:46.340 --> 3:02:47.340]  You know what I mean?
[3:02:47.340 --> 3:02:52.580]  There was an element of, they learned a valuable lesson about branding and marketing, the sigil
[3:02:52.580 --> 3:02:54.300]  magic that is large corporations.
[3:02:54.300 --> 3:02:55.580]  Well, it was something different.
[3:02:55.580 --> 3:02:56.580]  It's like the...
[3:02:56.580 --> 3:02:57.580]  It's kind of just a bunch of billboards.
[3:02:57.580 --> 3:03:01.220]  It was like the folks that danced at the Jefferson Memorial and got arrested.
[3:03:01.220 --> 3:03:05.660]  That got giant attention because it was novel, or not protesting outside the Texas Capitol,
[3:03:05.660 --> 3:03:07.620]  storming into it, got national attention.
[3:03:07.620 --> 3:03:13.500]  Exactly, and I think there's a value to something similar like that at the 9-11 site that is
[3:03:13.500 --> 3:03:14.500]  complete silence.
[3:03:14.500 --> 3:03:17.940]  I mean, they had those zombie fallouts where people would make a point about radioactivity
[3:03:17.940 --> 3:03:18.940]  and those things.
[3:03:18.940 --> 3:03:21.540]  People would dress up as zombies and fall around in a nuclear reactor.
[3:03:21.540 --> 3:03:25.020]  That gets on the news, and it draws more attention than a bunch of people with billboards because
[3:03:25.020 --> 3:03:26.020]  that's it too easy to ignore.
[3:03:26.020 --> 3:03:27.020]  We got to think smart.
[3:03:27.020 --> 3:03:28.180]  Richard, do you have your take on that?
[3:03:28.180 --> 3:03:29.180]  Yeah, you know...
[3:03:29.180 --> 3:03:30.180]  And entertaining.
[3:03:30.180 --> 3:03:34.100]  To put it in a phrase and a soundbite, I think with things like 9-11 and 10th anniversaries
[3:03:34.100 --> 3:03:41.820]  of things like that, the message is too often how our world has changed and too little of
[3:03:41.820 --> 3:03:47.000]  how our world really hasn't changed, how the new boss is the old boss, how this moment
[3:03:47.000 --> 3:03:52.380]  in history is very similar to a moment in history from 50 years ago or 100 years ago
[3:03:52.380 --> 3:03:54.860]  where Opportunus came in and took away freedom.
[3:03:54.860 --> 3:03:56.420]  I mean, that's the Patriot...
[3:03:56.420 --> 3:03:57.620]  Yeah, like the Red Terror.
[3:03:57.620 --> 3:04:01.420]  They used that to take the general public's rights instead of actually going after the
[3:04:01.420 --> 3:04:03.060]  quote, Commies and over in Russia.
[3:04:03.060 --> 3:04:06.700]  That's like the gays are the new blacks kind of ideas, that the onslaught gay people are
[3:04:06.700 --> 3:04:10.860]  going to marry and they're going to try to inject their gay agenda and all that stuff.
[3:04:10.860 --> 3:04:11.860]  That's the same thing in the 60s.
[3:04:11.860 --> 3:04:15.220]  It was black people were coming to marry your white daughters and that kind of thing.
[3:04:15.220 --> 3:04:20.020]  And it was used as a crowbar to keep people from going, you know, we're not that different,
[3:04:20.020 --> 3:04:21.020]  actually.
[3:04:21.020 --> 3:04:22.020]  And there's also no...
[3:04:22.020 --> 3:04:27.260]  You know, there's a lot of conversation about the way the world changed and what these people
[3:04:27.260 --> 3:04:32.860]  symbolically meant and very little conversation about, let's talk again about what exactly
[3:04:32.860 --> 3:04:33.860]  happened here.
[3:04:33.860 --> 3:04:35.420]  Let's have that conversation.
[3:04:35.420 --> 3:04:39.820]  And what should, ultimately, what kind of security do we genuinely need and what security
[3:04:39.820 --> 3:04:40.820]  do we not need?
[3:04:40.820 --> 3:04:45.580]  And we can all agree as a group that there's a certain line we don't have to go past,
[3:04:45.580 --> 3:04:48.380]  that there's a certain amount of risk in life and we can be okay with it.
[3:04:48.380 --> 3:04:49.380]  Stay there, guys.
[3:04:49.380 --> 3:04:50.380]  We've got 12 more minutes on this side.
[3:04:50.380 --> 3:04:55.300]  I'm a jamming Scott, Janine, Matt, Mike and John, that'll be good for calls, but I want
[3:04:55.300 --> 3:04:56.780]  to hear from you on the other side.
[3:04:56.780 --> 3:04:57.780]  They'll be right back.
[3:04:57.780 --> 3:05:07.420]  David J. Smith for NewsWatch Magazine, did you know that the United Nations is a Trojan
[3:05:07.420 --> 3:05:09.420]  horse to America?
[3:05:09.420 --> 3:05:14.820]  They've been on the destruction of our national sovereignty, and Barack Obama and Hillary
[3:05:14.820 --> 3:05:17.500]  Clinton are in league with them.
[3:05:17.500 --> 3:05:22.220]  Obama and Clinton filed a grievance against the United States concerning human rights
[3:05:22.220 --> 3:05:24.100]  violations.
[3:05:24.100 --> 3:05:31.900]  If we accept the United Nations' norm for human rights, we'll lose our national sovereignty.
[3:05:31.900 --> 3:05:35.220]  They hate Arizona for upholding our laws.
[3:05:35.220 --> 3:05:37.940]  They want illegal aliens in this country.
[3:05:37.940 --> 3:05:43.020]  We'd like to help you understand why these things are happening by offering you an absolutely
[3:05:43.020 --> 3:05:47.220]  free one-year subscription to NewsWatch Magazine.
[3:05:47.220 --> 3:06:06.020]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[3:06:06.020 --> 3:06:10.340]  Number one, new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[3:06:10.340 --> 3:06:14.660]  Number two, our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company
[3:06:14.660 --> 3:06:15.980]  allows you to have.
[3:06:15.980 --> 3:06:16.980]  It's true.
[3:06:16.980 --> 3:06:21.700]  The government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[3:06:21.700 --> 3:06:26.020]  Number three, in some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[3:06:26.020 --> 3:06:30.020]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[3:06:30.020 --> 3:06:33.540]  Number four, dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[3:06:33.540 --> 3:06:37.220]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related onages.
[3:06:37.220 --> 3:06:41.980]  Number five, a solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind.
[3:06:41.980 --> 3:06:45.780]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science,
[3:06:45.780 --> 3:06:47.140]  to my oldest sponsors.

[3:08:25.300 --> 3:08:29.100]  What do you mean I don't support your sister?
[3:08:29.100 --> 3:08:30.100]  That's a good guy.
[3:08:30.100 --> 3:08:31.100]  Yeah, he's lovely.
[3:08:31.100 --> 3:08:36.420]  Everybody's a lovely guy after they stop being a jerk.
[3:08:36.420 --> 3:08:38.420]  It's amazing.
[3:08:38.420 --> 3:08:40.540]  It's enough to make you a lovely guy.
[3:08:40.540 --> 3:08:45.260]  All right, let's go ahead and talk to Scott in Washington.
[3:08:45.260 --> 3:08:46.740]  Scott, you're on the air with our guest.
[3:08:46.740 --> 3:08:47.740]  Go ahead.
[3:08:47.740 --> 3:08:48.740]  Yeah, thank you, Alex.
[3:08:48.740 --> 3:08:53.940]  Actually, I want to redirect the question that you had asked these two, Mr. Sparks and
[3:08:53.940 --> 3:08:59.660]  Mr. Hunter, at the very beginning about the fact of Obama continuing the torture, the
[3:08:59.660 --> 3:09:00.660]  wars.
[3:09:00.660 --> 3:09:05.820]  King Obama now says we don't need, he doesn't need congressional approval to bomb Libyans
[3:09:05.820 --> 3:09:09.380]  and stuff, the same things that they decried Bush for.
[3:09:09.380 --> 3:09:14.100]  Where is the criticism now from the quote unquote so-called left, if you claim that
[3:09:14.100 --> 3:09:15.100]  you don't like it so much?
[3:09:15.100 --> 3:09:18.300]  Okay, first of all, I'll answer that.
[3:09:18.300 --> 3:09:24.460]  I think there's a big difference between a UN Act defending rebels in another country.
[3:09:24.460 --> 3:09:25.460]  Al-Qaeda.
[3:09:25.460 --> 3:09:28.580]  Okay, if you want to say that everybody who is on the side of it.
[3:09:28.580 --> 3:09:30.060]  The leadership is admittedly Al-Qaeda.
[3:09:30.060 --> 3:09:31.580]  I mean, it's not debated.
[3:09:31.580 --> 3:09:34.940]  Right, but the people on the ground, that doesn't automatically preclude that they
[3:09:34.940 --> 3:09:38.820]  mean death to America because they're trying to fight Qaddafi.
[3:09:38.820 --> 3:09:43.860]  The point I'm trying to make is there's a huge difference between authorizing our government
[3:09:43.860 --> 3:09:51.780]  to be involved in keeping planes from bombing cities in another country and invading Iraq
[3:09:51.780 --> 3:09:53.940]  and sending massive amounts of troops over there.
[3:09:53.940 --> 3:09:59.940]  If you think Iraq and Libya or Egypt are the exact same thing, tell me that.
[3:09:59.940 --> 3:10:04.900]  You really believe that the commitment in Egypt is the exact same as Iraq.
[3:10:04.900 --> 3:10:05.900]  If you're going to denigrate-
[3:10:05.900 --> 3:10:09.260]  Well, no, the Iraq things started with no fly zones and bombing and all that, and we've
[3:10:09.260 --> 3:10:12.260]  got U.S. troops there advising them.
[3:10:12.260 --> 3:10:13.940]  In a way, it's worse because-
[3:10:13.940 --> 3:10:14.940]  Really?
[3:10:14.940 --> 3:10:15.940]  It's worse?
[3:10:15.940 --> 3:10:16.940]  Let me explain.
[3:10:16.940 --> 3:10:20.340]  It's worse constitutionally because as bad as Bush was and I was against those wars,
[3:10:20.340 --> 3:10:22.580]  he went to Congress and got the approval.
[3:10:22.580 --> 3:10:23.580]  This is a big deal.
[3:10:23.580 --> 3:10:28.100]  This is like Caesar crossing the Rubicon to launch this and then to say it's not a war.
[3:10:28.100 --> 3:10:33.220]  It's a kinetic action and to feed us all of this and then to leave troops in Iraq and
[3:10:33.220 --> 3:10:39.220]  but call them diplomats and to keep Guantanamo Bay going.
[3:10:39.220 --> 3:10:40.220]  Right.
[3:10:40.220 --> 3:10:41.220]  Well, we bet with it.
[3:10:41.220 --> 3:10:43.020]  I mean, look at the base we have in Okinawa and Germany.
[3:10:43.020 --> 3:10:45.220]  Is it possible to criticize Lord Obama?
[3:10:45.220 --> 3:10:46.220]  Of course it is.
[3:10:46.220 --> 3:10:49.340]  But you also can't just sweep everything as if it's all equal.
[3:10:49.340 --> 3:10:50.580]  Did he keep the torture going?
[3:10:50.580 --> 3:10:51.580]  Yeah.
[3:10:51.580 --> 3:10:52.580]  Did he keep the secret arrest going?
[3:10:52.580 --> 3:10:54.900]  My old point is they're bought and paid for by the same people.
[3:10:54.900 --> 3:10:55.900]  Yes.
[3:10:55.900 --> 3:10:56.900]  Okay.
[3:10:56.900 --> 3:11:00.020]  And so here's where Obama supporters, I think, deserve some blame.
[3:11:00.020 --> 3:11:01.020]  Okay?
[3:11:01.020 --> 3:11:07.820]  Yeah, an analogy I'll draw to the invasion of Iraq in the wake of 9-11 that got us conveniently
[3:11:07.820 --> 3:11:12.460]  off of dealing with what really happened there and now we're focused on invading Iraq that
[3:11:12.460 --> 3:11:14.060]  didn't have anything to do with 9-11.
[3:11:14.060 --> 3:11:15.420]  To me, it's the same thing.
[3:11:15.420 --> 3:11:21.020]  You get Obama elected and if you supported him, you have your guy in office now, but
[3:11:21.020 --> 3:11:25.060]  when you vacate the political process and there were plenty of listeners to my own show
[3:11:25.060 --> 3:11:29.700]  who did that, like I said, our guy won, I'll see you in four years, to me, that's what
[3:11:29.700 --> 3:11:32.220]  the, in a sense, that's kind of like what the Tea Party was.
[3:11:32.220 --> 3:11:37.180]  They were sort of like the invasion of Iraq in the wake of, we were right in the middle
[3:11:37.180 --> 3:11:41.700]  of getting some stuff done and because you guys left the party and these people showed
[3:11:41.700 --> 3:11:46.060]  up and they're outraged and they're clamoring for less and less government and all the focus
[3:11:46.060 --> 3:11:50.500]  turns on that because political creatures, they're listening to whoever is making the
[3:11:50.500 --> 3:11:55.420]  most noise and if the masses, if the people, aren't speaking out, I mean Obama supporters,
[3:11:55.420 --> 3:12:01.020]  Obama has been doing what Bush did, stealing everything nailed down for the foreign banks,
[3:12:01.020 --> 3:12:02.020]  looting the daylight.
[3:12:02.020 --> 3:12:06.380]  So because he's being directed to do it, his support, my point is he's bought and paid
[3:12:06.380 --> 3:12:07.380]  for by the big banks.
[3:12:07.380 --> 3:12:11.820]  Okay, but what I'm saying is there should be more people who are drowning out the voice
[3:12:11.820 --> 3:12:12.820]  of the big banks.
[3:12:12.820 --> 3:12:17.420]  I know they have the money, but if the actual masses, yeah, but if people go to a Las Vegas
[3:12:17.420 --> 3:12:21.380]  fight and Boudin King, it doesn't matter because he owns the fight and he owns both
[3:12:21.380 --> 3:12:22.380]  fighters.
[3:12:22.380 --> 3:12:25.540]  The problem with that is- That's all I'm saying is both the fighters are owned.
[3:12:25.540 --> 3:12:29.260]  So I get the concept of okay, we need to start over from scratch, but that's a very difficult
[3:12:29.260 --> 3:12:30.260]  thing to do.
[3:12:30.260 --> 3:12:31.260]  We gotta admit just how bad this is.
[3:12:31.260 --> 3:12:34.900]  Yeah, but it's a very difficult thing to do midstream to start over from scratch.
[3:12:34.900 --> 3:12:38.300]  Okay, for example, here's a good example, when Obama got in, he signed an executive
[3:12:38.300 --> 3:12:42.860]  order to close Guantanamo Bay and signed an executive order as president, a single act
[3:12:42.860 --> 3:12:45.620]  that he can do as an individual- To close it in one year.
[3:12:45.620 --> 3:12:48.700]  Right, to close it in one year, absolutely.
[3:12:48.700 --> 3:12:55.940]  And the Republicans specifically, the Republicans in office, defunded a movement of any prisoners
[3:12:55.940 --> 3:13:01.220]  into the United States for trial so that they could be tried under a non-military system.
[3:13:01.220 --> 3:13:05.060]  They defunded any area that they would be brought to-
[3:13:05.060 --> 3:13:06.060]  No, they're bad.
[3:13:06.060 --> 3:13:07.060]  I mean, that's wrong.
[3:13:07.060 --> 3:13:12.700]  What I'm saying is, if you're gonna say that all I'm doing is inflating Obama and that
[3:13:12.700 --> 3:13:15.060]  I support everything he does- Let me ask you this.
[3:13:15.060 --> 3:13:19.460]  You can't just wipe away the fact that he's actually tried to do and been undermined by
[3:13:19.460 --> 3:13:22.020]  people who are- No, you made the point, it's a good point
[3:13:22.020 --> 3:13:23.020]  on that issue.
[3:13:23.020 --> 3:13:24.580]  Scott, do you have anything else to add?
[3:13:24.580 --> 3:13:27.380]  No, I wanted to correct Kyle on something.
[3:13:27.380 --> 3:13:31.620]  Actually at that executive order, you actually read it, what it said was that they were going
[3:13:31.620 --> 3:13:35.300]  to actually just look at closing- Yeah, that's what it said.
[3:13:35.300 --> 3:13:40.820]  Not that they were going to, and it was not practical that they had other torture sites
[3:13:40.820 --> 3:13:42.140]  that they would keep open.
[3:13:42.140 --> 3:13:46.020]  So I- Well, the executive order says we'll keep other torture sites open.
[3:13:46.020 --> 3:13:48.700]  No, instead we'll use other sites in other parts of the world.
[3:13:48.700 --> 3:13:51.100]  I remember covering- Because they weren't guaranteed they could
[3:13:51.100 --> 3:13:53.580]  move them into the states and try them in Michigan, which is where they were going to
[3:13:53.580 --> 3:13:54.580]  do.
[3:13:54.580 --> 3:13:55.580]  They were going to do a federal court in Michigan and try them-
[3:13:55.580 --> 3:13:56.580]  No, no, no.
[3:13:56.580 --> 3:13:57.580]  That point's well taken.
[3:13:57.580 --> 3:13:58.580]  Remember, Scott?
[3:13:58.580 --> 3:13:59.580]  They shut.
[3:13:59.580 --> 3:14:00.580]  Scott, I appreciate your call.
[3:14:00.580 --> 3:14:03.220]  The fact is, most Americans wouldn't know what Scott knew or what we know.
[3:14:03.220 --> 3:14:04.220]  That's what's sad.
[3:14:04.220 --> 3:14:06.380]  We gotta get people to even know all that minutia.
[3:14:06.380 --> 3:14:09.500]  People don't even probably remember- You don't care about the rule of law and the
[3:14:09.500 --> 3:14:15.220]  thing that makes America spectacular in that regard is that we rule of law should apply
[3:14:15.220 --> 3:14:16.220]  evenly to everyone.
[3:14:16.220 --> 3:14:17.720]  Yeah, but I gotta be honest.
[3:14:17.720 --> 3:14:22.180]  I mean, I gave you that point, but that's what Obama's always done, is, well, now we're
[3:14:22.180 --> 3:14:27.260]  keeping 50,000 troops two years ago for another couple of years, but they're not combat brigades.
[3:14:27.260 --> 3:14:28.860]  They're combat assistance brigades.
[3:14:28.860 --> 3:14:29.860]  And now we're keeping 15,000 troops.
[3:14:29.860 --> 3:14:31.860]  You've done that in every war you've ever been.
[3:14:31.860 --> 3:14:32.860]  I know.
[3:14:32.860 --> 3:14:33.860]  It's gotta stop.
[3:14:33.860 --> 3:14:34.860]  I agree.
[3:14:34.860 --> 3:14:35.860]  It's gotta stop.
[3:14:35.860 --> 3:14:38.660]  But that's- Is that the military industrial complex just holding on and going, look, one
[3:14:38.660 --> 3:14:43.100]  of the biggest, the only things we make in this country anymore are battleships, essentially,
[3:14:43.100 --> 3:14:44.100]  and big land movers.
[3:14:44.100 --> 3:14:45.100]  No, no.
[3:14:45.100 --> 3:14:49.100]  I've heard, I've heard mainline Republicans going, you know, we're not gonna cut the defense
[3:14:49.100 --> 3:14:50.100]  spending.
[3:14:50.100 --> 3:14:51.100]  We're not gonna let Obama cut it.
[3:14:51.100 --> 3:14:52.820]  Obama has increased its record levels.
[3:14:52.820 --> 3:14:54.660]  They should be absolutely happy.
[3:14:54.660 --> 3:14:56.180]  And that's another form of welfare.
[3:14:56.180 --> 3:14:57.180]  I agree.
[3:14:57.180 --> 3:14:59.620]  And very little of that ever gets back to the American people.
[3:14:59.620 --> 3:15:00.740]  I'm against it all.
[3:15:00.740 --> 3:15:04.340]  We don't need six times the armed forces of every other country in the world to fight
[3:15:04.340 --> 3:15:05.860]  an enemy that basically doesn't exist.
[3:15:05.860 --> 3:15:09.220]  Technically, they have 100% of military force in equipment spending.
[3:15:09.220 --> 3:15:10.780]  The United States is 54%.
[3:15:10.780 --> 3:15:11.780]  Right.
[3:15:11.780 --> 3:15:14.660]  But I mean- You're saying six times is the biggest other country.
[3:15:14.660 --> 3:15:15.820]  And no, no, no.
[3:15:15.820 --> 3:15:20.180]  Six times all of them combined as far as warfare capability, including our nuclear arsenal.
[3:15:20.180 --> 3:15:23.460]  I mean, we have, in this country, we have, I think it's somewhere in the order of like
[3:15:23.460 --> 3:15:27.140]  9,800 active nuclear missiles in sites in the United States.
[3:15:27.140 --> 3:15:34.180]  There's something in the order of 7,500 Starbucks in the country, and they're frigging everywhere.
[3:15:34.180 --> 3:15:37.180]  Look around, every Starbucks you see, there's a missile and a cord.
[3:15:37.180 --> 3:15:38.700]  Hey, haven't you heard?
[3:15:38.700 --> 3:15:39.700]  Radiation's good for you.
[3:15:39.700 --> 3:15:43.540]  Let's talk to Janina in New Mexico out there where they've had the radiation fires at
[3:15:43.540 --> 3:15:44.540]  Los Alamos.
[3:15:44.540 --> 3:15:45.540]  Janine, you're on the air.
[3:15:45.540 --> 3:15:46.540]  Thanks for holding.
[3:15:46.540 --> 3:15:47.540]  She just dropped off.
[3:15:47.540 --> 3:15:49.220]  She's sick of hearing us.
[3:15:49.220 --> 3:15:50.820]  Matt in Pennsylvania, you're on the air.
[3:15:50.820 --> 3:15:51.820]  Go ahead, Matt.
[3:15:51.820 --> 3:15:54.940]  Alex, my friend, how are, how are you doing?
[3:15:54.940 --> 3:15:57.780]  I'm in here with Nikki Sixx and Hal Sparks.
[3:15:57.780 --> 3:16:00.220]  Nikki Sixx and Hal Sparks.
[3:16:00.220 --> 3:16:02.420]  Oh, Nikki, I'm in recovery.
[3:16:02.420 --> 3:16:07.740]  It's a joke, it's Richard Hunter, bro.
[3:16:07.740 --> 3:16:08.740]  Go ahead.
[3:16:08.740 --> 3:16:22.020]  Oh, well, anyway, first of all, what is this white citizens being most likely to be terrorists?
[3:16:22.020 --> 3:16:23.020]  I mean...
[3:16:23.020 --> 3:16:24.020]  Well, arguably...
[3:16:24.020 --> 3:16:25.620]  Everybody knows why he's bad.
[3:16:25.620 --> 3:16:31.180]  Well, beyond that, if you look at the statistics of who's actually opening fire in public for
[3:16:31.180 --> 3:16:33.140]  random reasons, that's who's doing it.
[3:16:33.140 --> 3:16:34.140]  You know why?
[3:16:34.140 --> 3:16:36.380]  Because we're a nation of mostly white people.
[3:16:36.380 --> 3:16:37.380]  And when you look at...
[3:16:37.380 --> 3:16:38.380]  Not if you count gang-related.
[3:16:38.380 --> 3:16:40.780]  I can pull up the firearm shooting.
[3:16:40.780 --> 3:16:43.780]  Gang-related shootings are against each other.
[3:16:43.780 --> 3:16:46.700]  Gang members don't walk into a mall and just shoot a bunch of people because they think
[3:16:46.700 --> 3:16:48.020]  the cops are coming to take their guns.
[3:16:48.020 --> 3:16:50.100]  They're not random about that.
[3:16:50.100 --> 3:16:51.100]  There's no threat.
[3:16:51.100 --> 3:16:53.020]  As a matter of fact, it's not even particularly news to me.
[3:16:53.020 --> 3:16:57.700]  Oh, now you're going to say that the shooter of the Congresswoman was a conservative?
[3:16:57.700 --> 3:16:59.460]  No, he was a psychotic.
[3:16:59.460 --> 3:17:03.060]  Yeah, no, I mean, dressed as a woman, yeah, he wasn't liberal or conservative.
[3:17:03.060 --> 3:17:06.700]  Even though he'd been a liberal before, he was totally whacked out taking hallucinogens
[3:17:06.700 --> 3:17:07.700]  every day.
[3:17:07.700 --> 3:17:08.700]  He was nuts.
[3:17:08.700 --> 3:17:09.700]  Yeah.
[3:17:09.700 --> 3:17:10.700]  He was a crazy person.
[3:17:10.700 --> 3:17:13.380]  But the point is, was he brown?
[3:17:13.380 --> 3:17:18.180]  Is that anti-white to point out the fact that that guy, the guy who was going to...
[3:17:18.180 --> 3:17:22.300]  Listen, I'm telling you, I have the training manuals, I can show them to you.
[3:17:22.300 --> 3:17:27.940]  That's because most of the time, when you look at the crime statistics because of gang-related
[3:17:27.940 --> 3:17:31.740]  stuff in this country, and by the way, the drive-by shootings of the 80s and the early
[3:17:31.740 --> 3:17:35.860]  90s that were related to black and Hispanic people have not arced into some giant, you
[3:17:35.860 --> 3:17:39.340]  know, violent wave by black and Hispanic people in this country.
[3:17:39.340 --> 3:17:40.580]  And actually, that has been.
[3:17:40.580 --> 3:17:41.580]  They've been killing each other in records.
[3:17:41.580 --> 3:17:42.580]  No, they haven't.
[3:17:42.580 --> 3:17:45.860]  Violent crimes, actual murders have gone down.
[3:17:45.860 --> 3:17:50.100]  And they're completely equal to when the Irish and the Italians were fighting for alcohol
[3:17:50.100 --> 3:17:52.100]  in the early 20s and 30s.
[3:17:52.100 --> 3:17:54.260]  This is the same kind of strategic stuff.
[3:17:54.260 --> 3:17:55.260]  They were shooting each other.
[3:17:55.260 --> 3:17:59.860]  Well, let's look, look, hey, hey, I got a quote by a Harvard professor saying, we will
[3:17:59.860 --> 3:18:01.100]  abolish whites.
[3:18:01.100 --> 3:18:02.100]  We will exterminate them.
[3:18:02.100 --> 3:18:06.620]  How do you not have a crazy person almost every education, the whole point of an open
[3:18:06.620 --> 3:18:12.100]  education system is that you allow for bizarre thought at certain times, like that's freedom
[3:18:12.100 --> 3:18:13.100]  of speech.
[3:18:13.100 --> 3:18:14.100]  Well, I just want to apologize.
[3:18:14.100 --> 3:18:15.780]  I want to apologize for being white.
[3:18:15.780 --> 3:18:16.780]  You don't have to do that.
[3:18:16.780 --> 3:18:18.300]  You should apologize for being chubby.
[3:18:18.300 --> 3:18:19.300]  That's all.
[3:18:19.300 --> 3:18:20.300]  That's your problem.
[3:18:20.300 --> 3:18:21.300]  Not that you're white.
[3:18:21.300 --> 3:18:23.540]  It's that you eat poorly and you don't take care of yourself and you drink too much coffee.
[3:18:23.540 --> 3:18:26.620]  That's something that's actually going to affect my tax dollars later because collectivism.
[3:18:26.620 --> 3:18:29.900]  No, when you get to collectivism, look, here's the thing.
[3:18:29.900 --> 3:18:32.420]  If you're against government health care, I'm for you.
[3:18:32.420 --> 3:18:33.420]  But here's the thing.
[3:18:33.420 --> 3:18:36.940]  You have to wear a medallion that says if I collapse or my foot starts to go rotten because
[3:18:36.940 --> 3:18:37.940]  of diabetes.
[3:18:37.940 --> 3:18:38.940]  I have my own insurance.
[3:18:38.940 --> 3:18:39.940]  I never.
[3:18:39.940 --> 3:18:40.940]  I have my own insurance.
[3:18:40.940 --> 3:18:41.940]  Right.
[3:18:41.940 --> 3:18:42.940]  But that's what I said when you first got on.
[3:18:42.940 --> 3:18:47.060]  Once you collectivize things and once you hear everybody communal, then they can start
[3:18:47.060 --> 3:18:50.100]  managing and nanny stating everybody and it's nightmarish.
[3:18:50.100 --> 3:18:51.100]  Let's jam in one more call.
[3:18:51.100 --> 3:18:52.100]  One more call.
[3:18:52.100 --> 3:18:55.660]  We're caring for the people, by the way, okay, we won't take any more calls.
[3:18:55.660 --> 3:18:56.860]  We only got one minute left.
[3:18:56.860 --> 3:18:59.220]  The insurance companies wrote that stinking health care plan.
[3:18:59.220 --> 3:19:00.220]  I know.
[3:19:00.220 --> 3:19:03.940]  And then they had all the lying democratic operatives kept there and say you were racist
[3:19:03.940 --> 3:19:05.060]  if you're against health care.
[3:19:05.060 --> 3:19:06.260]  I can play you the clips.
[3:19:06.260 --> 3:19:08.220]  Oh, you didn't know that?
[3:19:08.220 --> 3:19:13.660]  Carlos Watson, a slime ball, Matthews, Mr. Maddow, all of those guys.
[3:19:13.660 --> 3:19:14.660]  Mr. Maddow?
[3:19:14.660 --> 3:19:15.660]  Really?
[3:19:15.660 --> 3:19:16.660]  Yeah.
[3:19:16.660 --> 3:19:17.660]  Cause she's a lesbian.
[3:19:17.660 --> 3:19:18.660]  You're calling her a dude.
[3:19:18.660 --> 3:19:19.660]  No, no.
[3:19:19.660 --> 3:19:20.660]  Here's the deal.
[3:19:20.660 --> 3:19:21.660]  I don't even care about all that stuff.
[3:19:21.660 --> 3:19:23.420]  I called Janet Reno, Mr. Reno.
[3:19:23.420 --> 3:19:25.420]  Cause she has a short haircut and cause she's...
[3:19:25.420 --> 3:19:26.420]  No, because it's funny.
[3:19:26.420 --> 3:19:27.420]  She's a lesbian.
[3:19:27.420 --> 3:19:30.980]  I hear the liberals all the time with all their sex jokes all the time.
[3:19:30.980 --> 3:19:32.540]  No, I think it's funny.
[3:19:32.540 --> 3:19:33.540]  I don't think it's funny.
[3:19:33.540 --> 3:19:35.380]  Anyways, getting back to what I'm saying.
[3:19:35.380 --> 3:19:36.380]  Mr. Maddow.
[3:19:36.380 --> 3:19:37.380]  Yeah.
[3:19:37.380 --> 3:19:38.380]  Because I'm not politically correct.
[3:19:38.380 --> 3:19:39.380]  Mr. Maddow.
[3:19:39.380 --> 3:19:40.380]  I don't...
[3:19:40.380 --> 3:19:41.380]  That's not political correctness.
[3:19:41.380 --> 3:19:42.380]  I think it's a conspiracy.
[3:19:42.380 --> 3:19:43.380]  That's rudeness.
[3:19:43.380 --> 3:19:44.380]  Hey, no, you know what?
[3:19:44.380 --> 3:19:45.380]  I've made jokes about Ann Coulter being a man.
[3:19:45.380 --> 3:19:46.380]  I don't think that's right.
[3:19:46.380 --> 3:19:48.380]  It has nothing to do with whether she is or not.
[3:19:48.380 --> 3:19:49.380]  Either.
[3:19:49.380 --> 3:19:52.020]  I don't think anyone is... well, it's free speech and I think it's funny as hell.
[3:19:52.020 --> 3:19:53.020]  They arrest you now.
[3:19:53.020 --> 3:19:55.420]  They arrest you now in England for saying that.
[3:19:55.420 --> 3:19:56.900]  An evil white guy.
[3:19:56.900 --> 3:19:57.900]  There you go.
[3:19:57.900 --> 3:19:58.900]  Hey guys.
[3:19:58.900 --> 3:19:59.900]  I appreciate you both coming in.
[3:19:59.900 --> 3:20:19.260]  The Transmission starts now.
