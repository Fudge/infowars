[01:28.680 --> 01:33.760]  Dakotas but they won't use them on the borders to stop the drugs being brought
[01:33.760 --> 01:37.440]  across other things of course they won't because they're laundering that drug

[08:31.560 --> 08:36.200]  am your host Alex Jones we've got Glenn Spencer who has been exposing our open
[08:36.200 --> 08:42.160]  borders and the North American Union plan for more than two decades and now it
[08:42.160 --> 08:45.360]  is all completely in everyone's face they've announced the North American
[08:45.360 --> 08:49.760]  security perimeter they have announced through a new border deal the
[08:49.760 --> 08:54.320]  integration of all three countries just as they started Europe as a so-called
[08:54.320 --> 08:59.840]  trade deal then a border security deal and even 15 years ago if you talked
[08:59.840 --> 09:05.240]  about a European Union you were called a conspiracy theorist in Europe they kept
[09:05.240 --> 09:10.120]  saying no it's not a union no it's not a union it's just an economic development
[09:10.120 --> 09:14.840]  zone it's an agreement on steel tariffs it's an agreement on security it's an
[09:14.840 --> 09:20.320]  agreement on integration for the flow of goods and services and then two years
[09:20.320 --> 09:25.040]  ago Herman von Roompi head of the EU we played the clips here comes out and says
[09:25.040 --> 09:32.120]  we're setting up world government through this economic crises and they had
[09:32.120 --> 09:35.360]  the outgoing British Prime Minister Gordon Brown come out and say the same
[09:35.360 --> 09:39.840]  thing played that clip Al Gore said the same thing played that clip George Soros
[09:39.840 --> 09:44.040]  said the same thing played that clip I mean I played clip after clip they're in
[09:44.040 --> 09:49.560]  fall the Republic clip after clip clip after clip that we should probably do
[09:49.560 --> 09:55.080]  another newscast on the nightly news then reiterate here just just showing all
[09:55.080 --> 09:58.800]  the announcements of world government and how they were gonna set it up and how
[09:58.800 --> 10:02.640]  they were gonna use derivatives and economic implosion and then now here's
[10:02.640 --> 10:07.200]  the world government I would talk about this I had nightline here I was it
[10:07.200 --> 10:10.760]  earlier this year late last year I don't remember and and they're like so you
[10:10.760 --> 10:13.680]  believe there's a world government being formed by megabanks and I said no I
[10:13.680 --> 10:17.920]  don't believe it that's a thing I believe in lucky charms no I know that
[10:17.920 --> 10:21.520]  world government's being shut up and I'd like to come show you some clips in the
[10:21.520 --> 10:26.280]  end the the anchor of ABC nightly news it was here he's the weekend anchor he
[10:26.280 --> 10:31.040]  said I'm not gonna look at it I said come on he said okay and I played some
[10:31.040 --> 10:33.800]  new world order world government clips he said well they're talking about a
[10:33.800 --> 10:38.320]  different type of world government and smiled at me and then I went to dinner
[10:38.320 --> 10:44.280]  with his crew and you know they were all nice people nice on the surface but it
[10:44.280 --> 10:49.280]  was just it's still funny to them of course they were nice to me is it oh
[10:49.280 --> 10:52.520]  you're very successful you reach millions of people I mean it at that
[10:52.520 --> 10:58.600]  colleague level they were nice to me and were respectful but it was they knew
[10:58.600 --> 11:03.040]  they worked for one system and I worked for what they call the losers the
[11:03.040 --> 11:06.280]  American people people that want freedom you know to them it's a foregone
[11:06.280 --> 11:09.600]  conclusion world government but then they know they're not supposed to admit
[11:09.600 --> 11:14.680]  it's going on or say it's a bad thing and it was it was really creepy and the
[11:14.680 --> 11:18.640]  piece they did wasn't even that negative it was just here's the guy who
[11:18.640 --> 11:22.960]  believes in world government and you know he but but but but but but he
[11:22.960 --> 11:29.680]  believes it and it's only his belief and it basically it isn't true so they
[11:29.680 --> 11:36.880]  just have that appeal to authority that we're ABC news and we believe if we just
[11:36.880 --> 11:40.360]  make fun of this guy people will listen to us and that's not really the case
[11:40.360 --> 11:46.400]  anymore that's not really the case anymore you know I raised the North
[11:46.400 --> 11:52.840]  American Union issue because Paul Watson's written articles out of quotes in
[11:52.840 --> 12:00.880]  major European newspapers where people like Etienne Davignon the head of the
[12:00.880 --> 12:08.400]  Bilderberg group Viscount Etienne Davignon and others say we set up the
[12:08.400 --> 12:14.200]  euro to take over the sovereign countries through financial debt you
[12:14.200 --> 12:20.120]  pull these quotes up and and and and founders of the euro from 1957 quotes in
[12:20.120 --> 12:26.880]  the 80s and 90s one is in the BBC about we set it up to take over and get rid of
[12:26.880 --> 12:30.480]  the country sovereignty I mean I was listening to Bloomberg financial TV on
[12:30.480 --> 12:35.880]  XM a few weeks ago driving along at about 11 o'clock at night been working
[12:35.880 --> 12:40.120]  late and I actually heard them all I've heard it many times say yeah it's
[12:40.120 --> 12:43.320]  undemocratic what we're setting up in Europe and yeah Wall Street and the
[12:43.320 --> 12:46.080]  big mega banks are actually taking it over and getting rid of their sovereignty
[12:46.080 --> 12:49.200]  and that's actually a good thing that people not be able to vote their way out
[12:49.200 --> 12:59.040]  of this once they're into this and they went on and basically just bragged that
[12:59.040 --> 13:02.520]  there's now going to be a move and then I went home and pulled it up it was it was
[13:02.520 --> 13:08.240]  in the news to get rid of the football teams the national football teams being
[13:08.240 --> 13:14.640]  named after Italy or Spain or Germany or France or the Netherlands or England
[13:14.640 --> 13:25.560]  but they're now going to have euro you know t-rex euro crusader euro whatever
[13:25.560 --> 13:32.080]  the mascot is there they're debating making the teams not have the name of
[13:32.080 --> 13:37.360]  Spain or Italy or England but have a new name like you get rid of the
[13:37.360 --> 13:41.800]  Houston Oilers and you call them you know the Texas Titans but it won't be
[13:41.800 --> 13:49.160]  Texas Titans it would be EU Titans because they don't want any form of
[13:49.160 --> 13:54.760]  nationalism because the system they're replacing the nationalism with has none
[13:54.760 --> 14:00.080]  of the checks and balances that were built in to that national system it's
[14:00.080 --> 14:04.200]  not saying that national system was perfect it varies country to country
[14:04.200 --> 14:08.600]  but under this new global system there's nothing to even identify it's just
[14:08.600 --> 14:14.760]  these corporate boards that tell the the nation states what to do and are now
[14:14.760 --> 14:18.400]  going to get rid of them they're saying don't worry about the new EU unelected
[14:18.400 --> 14:21.960]  bureaucracy because we're just going to start phasing out your your state
[14:21.960 --> 14:25.200]  governments within your national government and then cut back the size
[14:25.200 --> 14:29.720]  of your national government and finally just get rid of it and make it
[14:29.720 --> 14:32.920]  administrative in fact I covered this two weeks ago it's it's actually back
[14:32.920 --> 14:38.560]  there in the control room somebody go get me the economist it's it's it's it's
[14:38.560 --> 14:42.280]  back there the other control room or maybe my office now it's somewhere and I
[14:42.280 --> 14:45.360]  think it's back in the control room I showed on TV but I want to show it to
[14:45.360 --> 14:50.120]  you here because I keep remembering it and wanting to show it to you it's here
[14:50.120 --> 14:54.080]  in the office again I showed it on TV the quotes if you're a new listener it's
[14:54.080 --> 14:59.600]  it's this month's economist or is it last month so it's got a jungle on the
[14:59.600 --> 15:06.200]  cover and it says well yes autocratic technocrats are taking over and rule by
[15:06.200 --> 15:11.800]  experts is the way to go not not not national auto determination and of
[15:11.800 --> 15:15.840]  course that's a quote by David Rockefeller in the 90s when he thinks
[15:15.840 --> 15:28.280]  the media attendees was in 1992 in Davignon France and he says to him he
[15:28.280 --> 15:33.880]  says to him you know the the rule of central bankers and finance capitalist
[15:33.880 --> 15:38.720]  is much much much more to be desired to paraphrase it than the auto
[15:38.720 --> 15:45.040]  determination of NATO states of it's a Freudian slip of nation states of course
[15:45.040 --> 15:49.920]  and they set up NATO to militarily take over that that's why I had the NATO
[15:49.920 --> 16:00.840]  point but Sarkozy we need Britain but there are no two Europe's and of course
[16:00.840 --> 16:06.840]  that's because Cameron is preparing to defend his veto see England since the
[16:06.840 --> 16:15.840]  Treaty of London in the 1947 and then they had ten years later the Treaty of
[16:15.840 --> 16:22.360]  Rome in 1957 which I've read and you can read it's online that created the
[16:22.360 --> 16:37.000]  European economic community oh you found it thank you and once they had once they
[16:37.000 --> 16:41.560]  had set that up then they could start having the traders in the governments
[16:41.560 --> 16:46.680]  transfer the power out to the unelected bureaucracies and now they're to the
[16:46.680 --> 16:51.040]  point where Lord Monkton has corrected me a lot of telegraph is also come out
[16:51.040 --> 16:56.880]  the numbers 82 percent of all national laws in the United Kingdom Ireland
[16:56.880 --> 17:07.560]  Scotland England Wales you name it all those sub states 82 percent of all of
[17:07.560 --> 17:17.640]  their laws are now made this is key are now made by the unelected bureaucracy of
[17:17.640 --> 17:23.360]  the European Union and your country just like in the UN model of NGOs gets to
[17:23.360 --> 17:29.520]  elect members of you of of the EU Parliament but the EU Parliament can
[17:29.520 --> 17:34.120]  only debate things and put a recommendation to the permanent
[17:34.120 --> 17:40.560]  bureaucracy and all of them are either you Genesis scientist or Goldman Sachs
[17:40.560 --> 17:47.640]  JP Morgan or Bank of England types all of them and then now they're saying well
[17:47.640 --> 17:50.680]  Spain's not doing what we want Italy's not doing what we want Ireland's not
[17:50.680 --> 17:55.840]  doing what we want we're just gonna put our new leader in and you see this in
[17:55.840 --> 18:00.440]  Greece you see this in Italy where they actually put members of the European
[18:00.440 --> 18:05.200]  Central Bank from the bureaucracy and it's admitted in the news they say rule
[18:05.200 --> 18:13.400]  by bankers now I have here in my hands the articles where Cameron's coming on
[18:13.400 --> 18:17.320]  against this and and why is he doing this well it's a sophisticated double
[18:17.320 --> 18:24.880]  game the elites in England helps set up on record the European Union with the
[18:24.880 --> 18:32.600]  Treaty of London and the Treaty of Rome and now Germany and France want this
[18:32.600 --> 18:38.280]  expanded superhero to actually have some power by Germany and France not just by
[18:38.280 --> 18:48.760]  the bureaucracy and so Cameron is saying no I'm gonna veto this because they
[18:48.760 --> 18:52.400]  want basically pure banker power and for it to stay in the city of London
[18:52.400 --> 18:57.760]  within London the financial district instead of going to Luxembourg and other
[18:57.760 --> 19:03.120]  areas and then some of the Frankfurt in Germany some of the other big financial
[19:03.120 --> 19:06.640]  centers so that's the whole debate and I saw a time magazine headline last night
[19:06.640 --> 19:13.200]  it was such deception it said Cameron box City of London and I thought man I
[19:13.200 --> 19:16.640]  must be living in the twilight zone that's a very bold lie so I even went
[19:16.640 --> 19:19.960]  and looked up the British papers they admitted defending the City of London's
[19:19.960 --> 19:26.880]  hegemonic control over world finance Cameron you know outrageous Sarkozy and
[19:26.880 --> 19:30.960]  Merkel every article just hunt just hundreds of them link there and I read
[19:30.960 --> 19:36.120]  five or six just to make sure I was correct and I tell you they feed us pure
[19:36.120 --> 19:40.520]  disinformation here in the US yeah here's that economist and this was the

[19:53.160 --> 19:58.480]  got the quotes about getting rid of sovereignty and freedom I'm great at this

[24:14.080 --> 24:20.160]  we are saying incredible historical things unfold right now I mean here's
[24:20.160 --> 24:27.440]  the headline sarcosis we need Britain but there are no two Europe's French
[24:27.440 --> 24:31.040]  president Nicholas Sarkozy admitted on money the European Union was now a two
[24:31.040 --> 24:35.160]  speed alliance but it says that Britain would not be forced out of the block
[24:35.160 --> 24:40.240]  single market no why should you you're already making 82% of the laws in
[24:40.240 --> 24:50.360]  England the members of the UK's delegation to the EU parliament admit
[24:50.360 --> 24:55.320]  they don't have any power in it so of course I mean you've already basically
[24:55.320 --> 24:59.420]  taken England over and people say well wait a minute you were just saying
[24:59.420 --> 25:04.960]  England helps set up the EU the elites the globalist the imperialist the
[25:04.960 --> 25:10.800]  anti-free market monopoly men have used England and its military and its people
[25:10.800 --> 25:16.480]  as an engine of global domination for 300 years and it's the same thing now
[25:16.480 --> 25:23.240]  the United States the last 50 or 60 we are controlled by these special interests
[25:23.240 --> 25:29.200]  and right now they're just different arms of the same system jockeying with
[25:29.200 --> 25:34.200]  what's left of national sovereignty and different sub elites for who is going to
[25:34.200 --> 25:38.020]  come out on top but they agree on the global government they agree on
[25:38.020 --> 25:42.120]  destroying the family they agree on the carbon taxes they agree on getting rid
[25:42.120 --> 25:47.680]  of their borders they're just using the vestiges of national sovereignty to try
[25:47.680 --> 25:52.280]  to get better positions on each other this is how they're developing the new
[25:52.280 --> 25:59.200]  world order David Cameron UK Prime Minister will on Monday defend as a
[25:59.200 --> 26:04.640]  decision that's today to veto a new EU treaty to enforce fiscal discipline in
[26:04.640 --> 26:08.520]  the eurozone amid warnings from his coalition deputy that it could leave
[26:08.520 --> 26:13.440]  Britain isolated and marginalized and this is austerity and they don't cut
[26:13.440 --> 26:17.000]  you even your your private pension funds the government is taking them over in
[26:17.000 --> 26:21.440]  Portugal and other areas and use that to pay off government debts that of course
[26:21.440 --> 26:26.880]  that's pure thieving as well it's given to the mega banks that set up the euro
[26:26.880 --> 26:33.520]  and who created the derivatives most of this over 90% is their debt and the
[26:33.520 --> 26:37.360]  only country to say no and I know I talk about this a lot because it's key is
[26:37.360 --> 26:42.160]  Iceland or over a year they protested they demonstrated they wouldn't they
[26:42.160 --> 26:46.600]  stopped paying their regular taxes they started taking over banks and sit-ins the
[26:46.600 --> 26:50.640]  police figured out they had no future they got behind the people game over and
[26:50.640 --> 26:54.760]  overnight it turned out oh my gosh when they finally forced the fine the
[26:54.760 --> 26:59.880]  finance minister out 90 plus percent was it 92 93 percent was not owed by the
[26:59.880 --> 27:04.560]  people the 400,000 of Iceland and of rocky a vector main capital city that has
[27:04.560 --> 27:12.800]  most the population in it they were not debt surfs she the globalist wanted to
[27:12.800 --> 27:15.680]  bring them into debt to get all their natural gas their oil their incredible
[27:15.680 --> 27:21.040]  resources that if you break it down each Icelander is worth tens of millions of
[27:21.040 --> 27:24.560]  dollars if you just look at what's been discovered in natural resources and
[27:24.560 --> 27:31.280]  fishing and oil and metals and everything but the bankers wanted to get
[27:31.280 --> 27:35.840]  them into bondage so they had their finance minister get deep into debt in
[27:35.840 --> 27:42.480]  investing the country derivatives and and and tying the country's overall wealth
[27:42.480 --> 27:49.680]  and debts into the private banking consortium and the Bank of England's
[27:49.680 --> 27:55.280]  own debts and then the media in Iceland played along with the hoax and said oh
[27:55.280 --> 28:00.600]  my gosh you all owe around four hundred thousand dollars a piece and England had
[28:00.600 --> 28:04.880]  headlines remember last year of Icelanders or terrorists may not be
[28:04.880 --> 28:08.400]  allowed to fly on British airways or ever go to the continent of Europe if
[28:08.400 --> 28:11.400]  they don't pay their debt and they just said we don't know it we know it's a
[28:11.400 --> 28:16.200]  fraud and then it all came out it wasn't their debt came out earlier this year
[28:16.200 --> 28:23.000]  went back in January that Ireland fastest growing best position in Europe
[28:23.000 --> 28:29.520]  entered the euro after multiple votes finally voted themselves in most
[28:29.520 --> 28:33.600]  countries didn't have that choice if you believe the election they voted it in by
[28:33.600 --> 28:39.120]  a narrow margin after trouncing it just a year before and suddenly they go you
[28:39.120 --> 28:43.440]  know what you aren't doing well you are bankrupt and we've got to raise your
[28:43.440 --> 28:49.200]  taxes and then even their own finance minister came out and said it's best for
[28:49.200 --> 28:54.960]  Ireland to be run by foreign banks that was a quote on TV and the BBC carried it
[28:54.960 --> 28:59.040]  just plain view it's best to be run by foreign banks and it turned out there
[28:59.040 --> 29:03.520]  again 90 plus percent of the debt was not Irish debt their government signed
[29:03.520 --> 29:08.080]  them on to too big to fail remember too big to fail in Europe and here now you
[29:08.080 --> 29:11.080]  never hear about too big to fail you never hear about the tens of trillions
[29:11.080 --> 29:18.120]  of debt we've been signed on to the 1,500 quadrillion so no no it's always
[29:18.120 --> 29:23.520]  about oh we have a 14.5 trillion dollar debt we've given the banks over 28
[29:23.520 --> 29:29.200]  trillion in bailouts we know of 16 trillion of it going to foreign banks
[29:29.200 --> 29:34.480]  oh but you never hear about that you only hear about how you've got to have
[29:34.480 --> 29:38.200]  your taxes raised you've got to pay more for your water and your power you've
[29:38.200 --> 29:42.680]  got to do all this for austerity now we come back here's the big report the big

[34:36.200 --> 34:41.480]  afraid to go down there and protesting myself I'm just I don't like getting in
[34:41.480 --> 34:46.960]  the presence of these wicked wicked devils anymore and he certainly is as
[34:46.960 --> 34:57.040]  wicked as the day is long it's just that it's not that I'm even so much tired but
[34:57.040 --> 35:04.360]  that it is mentally painful to actually gaze upon them when attorney general
[35:04.360 --> 35:07.960]  Janet Reno came to the University of Texas and spoke in the big auditorium I
[35:07.960 --> 35:12.480]  got up and got up to the microphone because I knew how to sit down towards
[35:12.480 --> 35:16.520]  the front and jump up when they went to questions and I was third or fourth
[35:16.520 --> 35:19.880]  asking questions and I brought up the congressional hearings had shown the
[35:19.880 --> 35:23.680]  Delta Force was there shooting the dividends and that the FLIR footage
[35:23.680 --> 35:27.880]  showed it and it made Reuters AP and a bunch of the publications and of course
[35:27.880 --> 35:31.680]  there's famous footage of that online where she starts shaking uncontrollably
[35:31.680 --> 35:36.480]  that was before she really had the Parkinson's bad and before they had
[35:36.480 --> 35:39.720]  said that the media and she wasn't shaking I heard asking the question and
[35:39.720 --> 35:46.080]  boy her her hands were just shaking full-on then she gave me this demonic
[35:46.080 --> 35:49.840]  smile but I have got so much to do I've got the nightly news tomorrow I've got
[35:49.840 --> 35:53.280]  all up but I'll probably end up going down there everybody needs to be there
[35:53.280 --> 35:56.240]  and obviously as soon as I get there they'll have cops sit on both sides of
[35:56.240 --> 35:59.720]  me and they'll try to tell me that I'm not allowed to get up and ask questions
[35:59.720 --> 36:03.720]  and they'll let all the other media in but it'll try to stop us so we're just
[36:03.720 --> 36:07.640]  going to call UT they always have a big set up of media down front we'll call
[36:07.640 --> 36:12.600]  the media call the UT media department say we're on the local radio 590 a.m.
[36:12.600 --> 36:17.520]  and we're on local TV and we're we're media you can't block us coming down
[36:17.520 --> 36:22.320]  there with our cameras and of course there's no rule against videotaping but
[36:22.320 --> 36:25.720]  they always have control freaks tell you can't they can't stop all of us with
[36:25.720 --> 36:29.320]  our iPhones the rest of it be there tomorrow and I've been on the University
[36:29.320 --> 36:34.520]  of Texas website they do not say when he is going to be there they say doors
[36:34.520 --> 36:39.760]  open at 515 so I would imagine that probably means he's speaking at 6 or
[36:39.760 --> 36:44.200]  7 just get down there at 515 and get the get get in the front first couple
[36:44.200 --> 36:49.400]  rows attorney general Eric Holder you know the guy caught line to Congress and
[36:49.400 --> 36:53.560]  shipping guns into Mexico to blame the second amendment CBS News got the memos
[36:53.560 --> 36:59.400]  last week or week and a half ago now oh the guy who wanted to run a false flag
[36:59.400 --> 37:03.720]  terror attack that got thousands of Mexicans killed hundreds of Americans
[37:03.720 --> 37:08.760]  including three police officers and three border patrol up to six now and we
[37:08.760 --> 37:14.280]  all know the six cops is better than a thousand Mexicans or a hundred Germans
[37:14.280 --> 37:18.840]  or 10,000 Chinese or 10 million Mexicans or 10 million Americans or some
[37:18.840 --> 37:22.680]  being sarcastic there ladies and gentlemen the life of a US citizen a
[37:22.680 --> 37:27.840]  Mexican citizen a Russian citizen is just as valuable as a police officer or
[37:27.840 --> 37:33.240]  border patrol but it it the media normally hypes it up though when cops get
[37:33.240 --> 37:38.040]  killed and it's terrible when police get killed the the point is is that why
[37:38.040 --> 37:41.680]  aren't they talking more about this this time because they don't want it
[37:41.680 --> 37:48.000]  discussed attorney general Eric Holder is scheduled to speak to University of
[37:48.000 --> 37:52.920]  Texas students on Tuesday evening this little visit is this is from the
[37:52.920 --> 38:00.200]  Republicans is sure to garner a much positive media attention and buzz from
[38:00.200 --> 38:04.360]  students but there are many reasons we can't let the Obama administration
[38:04.360 --> 38:09.320]  message to these young minds go unchallenged here are three offhand this
[38:09.320 --> 38:13.000]  is the Travis County Republican Party mr. Holder is against Texas drawing up
[38:13.000 --> 38:17.120]  its own redistricting plan he aggressively opposes the voter ID bill our
[38:17.120 --> 38:21.760]  elected legislator passed this season and get this he is for plans to involve
[38:21.760 --> 38:25.320]  the United Nations and elections in the US you know that was in the AP and
[38:25.320 --> 38:29.800]  Reuters last year talking about Arizona now let's stop there isn't it funny the
[38:29.800 --> 38:37.400]  Republican Party of Texas and of Travis County does not mention here fast and
[38:37.400 --> 38:42.680]  furious does not mention lying to Congress does not mention that they're
[38:42.680 --> 38:48.280]  telling Travis County Republican Party people and the young Republicans to go
[38:48.280 --> 38:53.320]  down there and protest him over redistricting and a bunch of inner party
[38:53.320 --> 38:59.840]  garbage how about you go down there and say you are a criminal who's been caught
[38:59.840 --> 39:04.000]  perjuring to Congress and caught shipping guns into Mexico and narcotics
[39:04.000 --> 39:09.160]  back into this country I'm glad that Richard Reeves who works here in the
[39:09.160 --> 39:15.000]  office brought this to my attention I didn't know about this I'm glad listeners
[39:15.000 --> 39:18.640]  emailed him I guess the rest of us missed it but we have some other
[39:18.640 --> 39:21.840]  articles about it we can put on screen here there's an Austin America
[39:21.840 --> 39:27.000]  Statement article on a couple others it says University of Texas welcomes US
[39:27.000 --> 39:35.760]  Attorney General Eric Holder to Austin isn't that just precious and it goes on
[39:35.760 --> 39:39.560]  we're gonna track more of this and learn more come and take a stand against the
[39:39.560 --> 39:44.360]  Obama administration and let let's change some minds about elections
[39:44.360 --> 39:50.320]  integrity and it goes on from there in this piece to say don't forget our

[40:41.280 --> 40:45.840]  local they'll all be in there because they're dutiful little servants who will
[40:45.840 --> 40:51.880]  show his anti-gun anti-Texas anti-national sovereignty UN speech
[40:51.880 --> 40:55.880]  about having the UN run our elections the UN that runs around murdering people
[40:55.880 --> 41:00.600]  worldwide and his routine routinely caught doing it and my head is spinning
[41:00.600 --> 41:07.080]  at this point well they can't stop your iPhones you know I'm not a litigious
[41:07.080 --> 41:14.320]  person but but but Rob do here in my office is suing Pittsburgh Pennsylvania
[41:14.320 --> 41:17.960]  for arresting him for no reason at the G20 he has it all on tape he's up on a
[41:17.960 --> 41:22.640]  hilltop videotaping him Billy clubbing women on bicycles for no reason
[41:22.640 --> 41:27.440]  students who dare eat in the park at 8 o'clock at night and they come up and
[41:27.440 --> 41:31.160]  arrest him and then go time up in the at a military base all night in the rain
[41:31.160 --> 41:36.480]  basically while they stripped searched other people and laughed at him and he
[41:36.480 --> 41:40.640]  saw trucks driving in with people with bags over their heads and you know I
[41:40.640 --> 41:44.800]  paid for the lawyer and stuff with the case but then he went ahead with Stuart
[41:44.800 --> 41:48.120]  Rhodes and followed suit against him but you know what I need to call University
[41:48.120 --> 41:54.400]  of Texas and say you know your taxpayer funded you group of larcenist crooks at
[41:54.400 --> 41:58.000]  the top with your hundred billion dollar permanent fund all the rest of it we
[41:58.000 --> 42:01.200]  know you're a big Ponzi scheme they're giving people degrees I'll never be able
[42:01.200 --> 42:04.920]  to use on average and that the football thing is the only thing that you know
[42:04.920 --> 42:10.000]  even operates at the university as a front it's certainly not the university
[42:10.000 --> 42:16.280]  my grandfather went to and ran track for and was roommates with who was the
[42:16.280 --> 42:22.720]  interesting factoid who was the Dallas Cowboys first coach Tom Landry he was
[42:22.720 --> 42:26.280]  roommates with Tom Landry and another against University of Texas and that
[42:26.280 --> 42:29.880]  family going there since it was founded but it's not the University of Texas
[42:29.880 --> 42:36.440]  anymore it's nothing but a envelope Ponzi scheme to have media takeovers
[42:36.440 --> 42:42.400]  football team purchases the baseball team purchases it's just a front it's just
[42:42.400 --> 42:50.680]  another leveraged buyout hedge fund and this hedge fund with their chancellor
[42:50.680 --> 42:53.880]  and the rest of them who sit around at their board meetings and giant gold
[42:53.880 --> 42:58.600]  thrones I'm not kidding look up their meeting room online they sit around in
[42:58.600 --> 43:04.600]  gold thrones jacking up the parking and the tuition everything else and then
[43:04.600 --> 43:09.120]  they're saying no cameras will be allowed because we're God just five years
[43:09.120 --> 43:13.240]  ago cameras were allowed they won't be able to stop everybody going in with
[43:13.240 --> 43:16.360]  your iPhones and your droids they're not going to be able to stop you they
[43:16.360 --> 43:22.920]  don't want people seeing his lordship be heckled nothing embarrassing for him
[43:22.920 --> 43:30.960]  nothing can embarrass his lordship everybody's got to be down there tomorrow
[43:30.960 --> 43:40.000]  oh man it's very painful to be around sniveling
[43:40.880 --> 43:47.320]  University police on power trips and the political departments little
[43:47.320 --> 43:54.760]  minders that in their little suits who are practicing bootlicking and and and
[43:54.760 --> 44:01.160]  all the rest of the you know sycophantic groveling that these little pimps engage
[44:01.160 --> 44:08.200]  in again it's just being around them and looking at them so disgusting and and
[44:08.200 --> 44:15.120]  and and to watch holder slink in like the dirty mobster he is it is great
[44:15.120 --> 44:24.040]  on me I need anger management I I don't need to be in their proximity and so I'm
[44:24.040 --> 44:27.280]  leaving it open but I have a sneaking suspicion I'm not going to be able to
[44:27.280 --> 44:31.560]  control myself I'm gonna have to go down there because I can only take so much
[44:31.560 --> 44:36.280]  of this and I was gonna get into the other big news here but this really
[44:36.280 --> 44:41.040]  blindsided me during the break being given this information and I feel
[44:41.040 --> 44:47.960]  physically ill right now even imagining them watching the cops how they get off
[44:47.960 --> 44:52.760]  on acting like you're evil and you're a terrorist and and and getting off on
[44:52.760 --> 44:57.600]  kissing up to the corruption and all of the political prostitutes that are in
[44:57.600 --> 45:04.640]  the LBJ school of public affairs and and all the CFR and trilateral
[45:04.640 --> 45:08.360]  commission that are in that nest and the former NSA development and all of them
[45:08.360 --> 45:15.080]  former NSA directors there all there just just loving the evil I mean it's
[45:15.080 --> 45:21.040]  like being able to teleport back in time and going to a Nuremberg Nazi rally in
[45:21.040 --> 45:26.160]  1937 I mean I know these are evil people this is the eugenics ruling class
[45:26.160 --> 45:30.520]  that is designing the GMO to sterilize us and give us cancer that's putting the
[45:30.520 --> 45:35.360]  hundreds of toxic poisons in the water including radioactive isotopes on record
[45:35.360 --> 45:40.600]  that is running UN extermination and sterilization programs worldwide to be
[45:40.600 --> 45:48.640]  in the same room with the main architect of the Oklahoma City bombing it is I
[45:48.640 --> 45:52.200]  deserve a few fringe benefits I mean I've been on the front lines for a long
[45:52.200 --> 45:59.800]  time and I I fight hard I worked in to 12 to 14 to 16 to 18 to sometimes 24
[45:59.800 --> 46:05.600]  hours a day on average I probably work 14 hours 16 hours a day and I as a general
[46:05.600 --> 46:11.080]  in the fight for liberty sometimes I I just don't want to be near the devil I
[46:11.080 --> 46:19.000]  just I do not like it and it is painful to watch all those people kiss the butt
[46:19.000 --> 46:28.400]  of a murderer I you know I just don't like it be honest with you I bet Arde
[46:28.400 --> 46:38.880]  Savada will be there looking on adoringly they all just worship power you
[46:38.880 --> 46:45.760]  know those aren't just words attorney general nobody else wants to Sam he's
[46:45.760 --> 46:49.720]  a murderer for shipping the thousands of guns into Mexico knowingly killing
[46:49.720 --> 46:53.560]  people including police officers and he's a liar and he's committed perjury
[46:53.560 --> 47:00.480]  but he ran the cover-up of Oklahoma City and ran the federal agents that we
[47:00.480 --> 47:05.720]  know were there on the ground and we have their hotel receipts and we carry
[47:05.720 --> 47:10.440]  in the new film that just came out a noble lie that breaks it all down and as
[47:10.440 --> 47:13.640]  the interview with the mother of the cop that witnessed it all Terrence Yeke and
[47:13.640 --> 47:20.040]  the head grandeur happy Heidelberg he was threatened with firearms by the FBI to
[47:20.040 --> 47:24.200]  stop calling witnesses and a lot of people been killed over this it's not
[47:24.200 --> 47:28.880]  fun to get up here and say this person is involved in Oklahoma City up to his
[47:28.880 --> 47:33.320]  eyeballs this is a scary person and it's not that I'm even scared of him I'm
[47:33.320 --> 47:44.040]  here calling him out on air it's just that don't I get any little vacations
[47:44.040 --> 47:48.200]  I mean it's a I am having a moral struggle right now I do not want to go
[47:48.200 --> 47:52.600]  down to UT tomorrow and I know you don't want to either but you know we got to go
[47:52.600 --> 47:54.880]  down there
[47:54.880 --> 48:01.040]  oh man that there's I mean it's I'd rather stick my hand in a blender when
[48:01.040 --> 48:04.920]  it's turned on and be around these people man because when you know you're
[48:04.920 --> 48:10.520]  dealing with a killer and you know they think it's funny
[48:16.520 --> 48:20.480]  and again it's not even being around the killer that's the problem it's watching
[48:20.480 --> 48:27.440]  the red carpet for them it's watching the religious worship of the demon and I
[48:27.440 --> 48:32.240]  have trouble dealing with Eric Holder coming to University of Texas tomorrow
[48:32.240 --> 48:37.320]  doors open at 515 I would imagine he's probably gonna speak at six then notice
[48:37.320 --> 48:40.440]  they don't even say when he's gonna speak I guess his security detail doesn't
[48:40.440 --> 48:43.600]  want anybody knowing because after all the American people are the terrorist
[48:43.600 --> 48:47.640]  coming up after the break Obama administration demanded power to
[48:47.640 --> 48:52.440]  indefinitely detain US citizens when they've been doing it for decades they
[48:52.440 --> 48:55.320]  love taking people like Congressman Hanson and others that almost got rid of
[48:55.320 --> 48:59.520]  the IRS and they drove him around off and on for months till his feet all popped
[48:59.520 --> 49:03.280]  and exploded and the bones were sticking out and rotted and got gangrene they
[49:03.280 --> 49:08.480]  thought that was real funny they made him defecating his pants for weeks on in
[49:08.480 --> 49:13.280]  that's the kind of people our government is just murdering scum absolute
[49:13.280 --> 49:18.480]  filth directly out of the pit of hell Obama administration demanded power to
[49:18.480 --> 49:21.760]  indefinitely detain US citizens why house remove language that would have
[49:21.760 --> 49:26.680]  protected Americans from section 10 at 31 how do we know this the main sponsor
[49:26.680 --> 49:32.040]  of the bill Carl Levin has come out and said don't blame us Obama asked for this
[49:32.040 --> 49:38.840]  that was kind of like with senator Dodd years ago there was a provision in there
[49:38.840 --> 49:44.080]  and the government of the president criticized him and he said will you ask
[49:44.080 --> 49:50.360]  for this what was it was the provisions for immunity for the big banks in the
[49:50.360 --> 49:55.280]  stimulus package and then Obama criticized Dodd and said he had added it
[49:55.280 --> 49:58.720]  when they and then Dodd came out and said here's the here's the memo from the
[49:58.720 --> 50:03.560]  White House asking me to add it well the same thing happened with Carl Levin so
[50:03.560 --> 50:08.960]  there's no honor among these criminals either and he has come out and said that
[50:08.960 --> 50:15.240]  it was Obama who required indefinite detainment bill to include US citizens
[50:15.240 --> 50:20.920]  I'll play that clip and then who are the terrorist army post job for internment

[54:16.720 --> 54:22.260]  and so I'm just thinking out loud I mean when you got somebody that ran
[54:22.260 --> 54:27.360]  Oklahoma City you got somebody shipping guns in Mexico caught red-handed to
[54:27.360 --> 54:32.960]  blame the Second Amendment as the memo say this is a this is a confirmed super
[54:32.960 --> 54:37.280]  wicked evil person eight federal agencies and federal court have had to
[54:37.280 --> 54:43.480]  admit they do ship drugs in they do launder money including they got all
[54:43.480 --> 54:52.560]  that sex trade stuff including in kids and he himself is just a pimp he himself
[54:52.560 --> 54:56.920]  is just a minion you got all these bankers removed from all the stuff they
[54:56.920 --> 55:00.600]  do they got henchmen like like like Holder that are down there doing it all
[55:00.600 --> 55:04.640]  it's just it's just ugh and he's going to come here and be honored it's so
[55:04.640 --> 55:09.760]  disgusting and the Republicans won't even go after him on fast and furious when
[55:09.760 --> 55:13.320]  he's caught red-handed because Holder said a month ago Bush was doing the same
[55:13.320 --> 55:19.800]  program drop it and this said yes sir Obama it's up to you that's the problem
[55:19.800 --> 55:23.840]  with corruption once you get them all corrupted any level none of them can
[55:23.840 --> 55:27.160]  stop each other from new levels of corruption because they're all in on it
[55:27.160 --> 55:32.280]  and then it gets worse and worse and worse you understand that you can't
[55:32.280 --> 55:36.840]  play games with this and I don't like having to get up here and expose
[55:36.840 --> 55:40.720]  murderers they're dangerous but you know what the final equation whatever I'm in
[55:40.720 --> 55:44.800]  God's hands somebody has got to bring these people to justice because they're
[55:44.800 --> 55:49.960]  not going to stop we're getting an article out at info wars calm now I
[55:49.960 --> 55:53.040]  mentioned this this is our top story today and as usual I don't get to my top
[55:53.040 --> 55:57.600]  story so about an hour into the show Obama administration demanded power to
[55:57.600 --> 56:01.600]  definitely detain US citizens remember the ACLU and others came out said Obama's
[56:01.600 --> 56:06.040]  going to veto it I said wait a minute they've put out this letter I have a
[56:06.040 --> 56:10.600]  copy of that how does the president have the right to target killing of US
[56:10.600 --> 56:15.760]  citizens ABC News his lawyers came out and said we're gonna veto this because
[56:15.760 --> 56:20.080]  we don't want Congress to even say they have power over law when Congress makes
[56:20.080 --> 56:23.880]  the laws the president executes I will launch wars I will torture I will kill
[56:23.880 --> 56:31.080]  I will secretly arrest and kill US citizens if I want and I'm doing it but
[56:31.080 --> 56:34.320]  the media let him have his cake and eat it too the media said he is a
[56:34.320 --> 56:40.160]  humanitarian really here's senator Carl Levin after he got heat for this he came
[56:40.160 --> 56:46.240]  out last week this is on the Senate floor and broke this down and it's in
[56:46.240 --> 56:49.960]  our article Obama administration demanded power to definitely detain US
[56:49.960 --> 57:02.160]  citizens here it is the clip the senator is familiar with the fact that the
[57:02.160 --> 57:11.280]  language the language which precluded the application of section 1031 to
[57:11.280 --> 57:16.840]  American citizens was in the bill that we originally approved in the armed
[57:16.840 --> 57:21.720]  services committee and the administration asked us to remove the language
[57:21.720 --> 57:27.760]  which says that US citizens in lawful residents would not be subject to this
[57:27.760 --> 57:31.440]  section is the senator familiar with the fact that was the administration that
[57:31.440 --> 57:36.240]  asked us to remove the very language which we had in the bill which passed
[57:36.240 --> 57:41.400]  the committee and that we removed it at the request of the administration that
[57:41.400 --> 57:48.120]  would have said the app that this determination would not apply to US
[57:48.120 --> 57:51.400]  citizens and lawful residents I'm just wondering if the senator familiar with
[57:51.400 --> 57:55.320]  the fact that was the administration which asked us to remove the very
[57:55.320 --> 58:01.960]  language the absence of which is now objected to by the senator from Illinois
[58:01.960 --> 58:05.320]  I'm familiar now because the senator from Michigan has shared that fact with
[58:05.320 --> 58:09.360]  me I'm oh and then the other senator agrees okay they're familiar now now
[58:09.360 --> 58:14.360]  remember so we couldn't stop this they made it a debate about whether it
[58:14.360 --> 58:17.760]  affected US citizens for two weeks and called me a liar and they've still got
[58:17.760 --> 58:21.880]  mainstream newspapers I won't even respond to last week saying I'm a liar
[58:21.880 --> 58:28.680]  and Ron Paul's a liar headlines like false alarm over a detention bill oh
[58:28.680 --> 58:32.600]  yeah and then once they got it through they go you know what the president was
[58:32.600 --> 58:38.080]  for it and it's for you and he's gonna sign it we'll be right back stay with
[58:38.080 --> 58:52.320]  us this is GCN the Genesis communications radio network you've heard Alex

[01:00:04.760 --> 01:00:12.680]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does

[01:00:20.200 --> 01:00:23.680]  Alex Jones
[01:00:26.200 --> 01:00:31.320]  okay Glenn Spencer is going to be joining us for about 20 30 minutes in the
[01:00:31.320 --> 01:00:35.680]  next segment then I'm gonna open the phones up for callers on the news I've
[01:00:35.680 --> 01:00:41.280]  already mentioned anything you want to bring up I am sickened it's not even
[01:00:41.280 --> 01:00:48.040]  hate me more it's just discussed at how fallen humanity is that a known admitted
[01:00:48.040 --> 01:00:54.360]  criminal it's more esoteric that's to be researched that a holder was deeply
[01:00:54.360 --> 01:00:59.880]  involved and probably the mastermind of Oklahoma City from the deep research
[01:00:59.880 --> 01:01:04.120]  I've done it's all there but it is in your face he shipped thousands of guns
[01:01:04.120 --> 01:01:07.800]  into Mexico didn't just let him be be sold in shops to blame the Second
[01:01:07.800 --> 01:01:16.520]  Amendment that CBS News AP Reuters lied to Congress all of it and to know
[01:01:16.520 --> 01:01:19.440]  they're gonna get away with it because he got up there like I said he would do
[01:01:19.440 --> 01:01:21.920]  because I knew Bush was involved and he said well there were other programs
[01:01:21.920 --> 01:01:27.560]  Bush was running like this so you better drop it and they said oh he's like yeah
[01:01:27.560 --> 01:01:34.840]  you think I'm just gonna let you bring up that I've been doing this see with
[01:01:34.840 --> 01:01:40.520]  Bush they were shipping the guns in to knock out their their cartels that
[01:01:40.520 --> 01:01:44.240]  weren't laundering their money properly we told you that whole war was coming
[01:01:44.240 --> 01:01:47.880]  about two years before it started before all this bloodshed Celica still in
[01:01:47.880 --> 01:01:52.120]  other sources we had said this was all coming and about the bases down in South
[01:01:52.120 --> 01:01:55.880]  Texas training for the war and the CIA and the troops trained at Fort Benning
[01:01:55.880 --> 01:02:06.120]  Georgia well now all of that has come out and Bush just didn't then blame it on
[01:02:06.120 --> 01:02:13.280]  the Second Amendment but so so the only new component is he blamed on the
[01:02:13.280 --> 01:02:16.400]  Second Amendment and they don't care if they got caught they've already issued
[01:02:16.400 --> 01:02:22.280]  new rules that aren't even in law which is totally illegal to gunshops to follow
[01:02:22.280 --> 01:02:27.400]  procedures that aren't even on the books even after being caught they don't care
[01:02:27.400 --> 01:02:32.480]  they don't care and now they're saying will arrest citizens and disappear you
[01:02:32.480 --> 01:02:36.640]  if you want they let me explain this they're saying they can grab Ron Paul out
[01:02:36.640 --> 01:02:40.120]  of his house and have him disappear forever they're saying they can grab
[01:02:40.120 --> 01:02:45.160]  Alex Jones out of his house and have me disappear forever this is what's being
[01:02:45.160 --> 01:02:50.960]  said this is what's being done this is what's going on and the tyrants think
[01:02:50.960 --> 01:02:54.920]  that those of you that are informed intellectual are going to get scared and
[01:02:54.920 --> 01:02:58.080]  back off and they think those that are dumbed down are just going to get
[01:02:58.080 --> 01:03:04.200]  further acclimated to accept classical bonafide 200 proof
[01:03:04.200 --> 01:03:10.720]  dragons breath tyranny they just think you're just gonna go along with it well
[01:03:10.720 --> 01:03:15.360]  I'm not gonna go along with it and I guess in this land of cowards home of
[01:03:15.360 --> 01:03:22.080]  slaves it is seen as weird and crazy to look into these things I mean look at
[01:03:22.080 --> 01:03:24.320]  the Republican Party then we're coming back from break and going to Glenn
[01:03:24.320 --> 01:03:37.840]  Spencer the Republican Party says that that they need to go to the lbj library
[01:03:37.840 --> 01:03:47.320]  in the main conference hall tomorrow and talk about how the Attorney General is
[01:03:47.320 --> 01:03:52.320]  trying to block Texas redistricting plan and aggressively opposes a voter ID
[01:03:52.320 --> 01:03:56.640]  bill our elected legislature passed last season and I guess you know I'm
[01:03:56.640 --> 01:04:00.960]  being mean here I mean I mean those are issues to go after it's and and they
[01:04:00.960 --> 01:04:07.560]  bring up the United Nations in the US to oversee our elections which is which is
[01:04:07.560 --> 01:04:18.720]  treason but but those issues are nothing nothing compared to red-handed in the
[01:04:18.720 --> 01:04:25.160]  cookie jar not just selling some guns and tracking them shipping them into
[01:04:25.160 --> 01:04:30.840]  Mexico shipping them into Indiana and Illinois and Tampa Florida and now we
[01:04:30.840 --> 01:04:34.720]  learn other areas the government gives them to certain gangs and lets them go
[01:04:34.720 --> 01:04:39.880]  kill certain people the gangs work for the Justice Department the drug cartels
[01:04:39.880 --> 01:04:45.320]  work for them the Justice Department and the CIA what's the cocaine in
[01:04:45.320 --> 01:04:49.840]  importation agency and now they've moved on to white slavery and little kids I

[01:09:20.280 --> 01:09:24.560]  released because there's good people inside releasing it and the Justice
[01:09:24.560 --> 01:09:27.760]  Department admits their real memos and is now wanting to find out who they are
[01:09:27.760 --> 01:09:31.160]  to arrest them kind of like three years ago wiki leaks love them or hate them
[01:09:31.160 --> 01:09:35.080]  they released an army manual that special ops captains in the army are
[01:09:35.080 --> 01:09:39.800]  given an above and it told them how to stage false flag attacks and then it
[01:09:39.800 --> 01:09:43.560]  says you know see this part of the course and a false flag is well you're
[01:09:43.560 --> 01:09:46.880]  outnumbered in the enemy territory you stage a terror attack blaming on your
[01:09:46.880 --> 01:09:51.600]  enemies incredible well that's what holders done you ship guns into Mexico
[01:09:51.600 --> 01:09:55.720]  not not just allowing to be sold into Mexico when you get caught you say oh
[01:09:55.720 --> 01:09:59.480]  we just tracked a few out of gun shops now it's come out in court cases they're
[01:09:59.480 --> 01:10:03.240]  allowing drugs to be brought in and laundering the money New York Times two
[01:10:03.240 --> 01:10:08.760]  Sundays ago eight nine days ago it's incredible and the Republican Party
[01:10:08.760 --> 01:10:13.960]  itself is saying go protesting for the UN thing and yeah I get you that's bad
[01:10:13.960 --> 01:10:20.960]  but it's we've got him we have him we have him caught red-handed we have his
[01:10:20.960 --> 01:10:26.480]  emails from lawsuits that family members and people have sued the government
[01:10:26.480 --> 01:10:31.240]  over Oklahoma City and they've got the emails from a holder even back in 95 he
[01:10:31.240 --> 01:10:34.320]  was emailing saying this is a D-day situation we've got to cover up what
[01:10:34.320 --> 01:10:39.360]  happened in Oklahoma City you can read them I mean this is a very nasty wicked
[01:10:39.360 --> 01:10:45.120]  person and so I'm calling on listeners I know they give it to UT alumni I'm an
[01:10:45.120 --> 01:10:48.960]  email list at show tips and info wars comm if you want to give us the tickets
[01:10:48.960 --> 01:10:53.480]  or we'll buy them from you to get into the meeting and then if they have
[01:10:53.480 --> 01:10:57.840]  checkpoints and are checking list and turn into the TSA that just shows where
[01:10:57.840 --> 01:11:01.560]  America's gone and they are doing this at a lot of events now and on the
[01:11:01.560 --> 01:11:06.840]  highways and it's just all about the criminals treating us like criminals so
[01:11:06.840 --> 01:11:09.520]  they can get away with bloody murder you know our borders are wide open we're
[01:11:09.520 --> 01:11:12.120]  talking to Glenn Spencer about it in a moment but look at this headline out of
[01:11:12.120 --> 01:11:20.160]  the examiner TSA thought woman's back brace was a money belt and didn't listen
[01:11:20.160 --> 01:11:22.960]  to her and went ahead and jerked it off her body like what is this it's a
[01:11:22.960 --> 01:11:30.080]  colostomy bag what's that sir I had a surgery I use the bathroom into that
[01:11:30.080 --> 01:11:35.080]  we're taking it off and actually rip them out of people and I'm not trying to
[01:11:35.080 --> 01:11:37.920]  get gross here that's what happened then it spills everywhere in front of
[01:11:37.920 --> 01:11:41.200]  everybody and then the TSA screams at him and says get behind closed doors and
[01:11:41.200 --> 01:11:44.400]  then we're strip searching you now off of your underwear you should have told
[01:11:44.400 --> 01:11:50.960]  me what that was I mean it's crazy how they act here's another one police
[01:11:50.960 --> 01:11:56.840]  employed border I had a Freudian slip I wish they were police employ predator
[01:11:56.840 --> 01:12:01.320]  drones spy planes on home front but not on our border helping local police with
[01:12:01.320 --> 01:12:08.200]  surveillance LA Times here's another one US protest boost sales and fears of
[01:12:08.200 --> 01:12:12.680]  sonic blaster including microwave guns sound cannons and here's another one
[01:12:12.680 --> 01:12:18.040]  police attest laser that blinds rioters there's another one undercover cops
[01:12:18.040 --> 01:12:22.440]  spy on occupied LA in search of domestic terrorists oh but it's not
[01:12:22.440 --> 01:12:27.080]  terrorism when Mexican troops kill people riding on jet skis or bass boats on
[01:12:27.080 --> 01:12:34.320]  lakes bordering Mexico it's not terrorism to have these type of things
[01:12:34.320 --> 01:12:39.440]  going on it's not terrorism of MS-13 killing cops six dead cops you've got
[01:12:39.440 --> 01:12:43.360]  three connected to it a couple with three board patrol several of them
[01:12:43.360 --> 01:12:47.640]  absolutely confirmed killed by guns shipped into Mexico by the attorney
[01:12:47.640 --> 01:12:52.680]  general he doesn't get any trouble it's unbelievable and now UT says no protest
[01:12:52.680 --> 01:12:57.320]  allowed on UT period we are God could protest just a few years ago can't get
[01:12:57.320 --> 01:13:00.680]  in to see the attorney general in the giant auditorium the taxpayers paid for
[01:13:00.680 --> 01:13:04.440]  in a state school we are your government we are your God if you have
[01:13:04.440 --> 01:13:09.800]  tickets you have a responsibility to go to do to videotape on your iPhone fast
[01:13:09.800 --> 01:13:15.040]  and furious blood on your hands he needs to be confronted and if I can get
[01:13:15.040 --> 01:13:19.520]  tickets I guess I'll go they know who I am boy let me tell you alright shifting
[01:13:19.520 --> 01:13:25.880]  gears Glenn Spencer is probably the probe the premiere hardcore reality-based
[01:13:25.880 --> 01:13:29.640]  individuals who understands the mega foundations the mega banks the North
[01:13:29.640 --> 01:13:33.720]  American Union the SPP documents where the government admits they want to shut
[01:13:33.720 --> 01:13:37.560]  down our borders and create one giant corporate state and since then they've
[01:13:37.560 --> 01:13:41.120]  announced the North American security perimeter they've announced harmonization
[01:13:41.120 --> 01:13:44.480]  of all of our laws it's been in the Washington Post that Mexican and
[01:13:44.480 --> 01:13:48.640]  Canadian troops will quote be used in America to deal with terrorists at the
[01:13:48.640 --> 01:13:54.080]  Olympics Mexican and US troops were in Canada just last year it's happening
[01:13:54.080 --> 01:13:59.560]  this is insane this is insane Glenn Spencer again is an American political
[01:13:59.560 --> 01:14:03.040]  and illegal immigration activist American Patrol.com and here's some of the
[01:14:03.040 --> 01:14:07.240]  articles he wants to get into US proposes unmanned border entry with
[01:14:07.240 --> 01:14:12.240]  Mexico to basically legalize everybody and then it continues here police
[01:14:12.240 --> 01:14:17.200]  employee predator drone spy planes on home front but not to stop the open
[01:14:17.200 --> 01:14:21.320]  borders they're gonna have checkpoints the middle of Tennessee and Illinois
[01:14:21.320 --> 01:14:26.560]  searching people's cars with the TSA out of their jurisdiction violating every
[01:14:26.560 --> 01:14:30.920]  candidate of free society right out of Nazi Germany it's not coming they're
[01:14:30.920 --> 01:14:36.640]  now doing it but they tell the border patrol they can look west or east they
[01:14:36.640 --> 01:14:42.240]  cannot look both directions and their main job is now picking up trash okay
[01:14:42.240 --> 01:14:45.240]  I'm gonna stop right there and go to Glenn Spencer I wanted to preface it all
[01:14:45.240 --> 01:14:49.320]  with that before we get into the latest you're facing and those two articles
[01:14:49.320 --> 01:14:53.000]  Glenn what do you make a fast and furious because that ties into everything
[01:14:53.000 --> 01:14:56.920]  we knew it was premeditated now it's hundreds of times worse the media first
[01:14:56.920 --> 01:15:01.360]  said they've been caught perjuring themselves and CBS News got the documents
[01:15:01.360 --> 01:15:05.200]  it was to blame the second amendment as if we needed to have the documents to
[01:15:05.200 --> 01:15:10.840]  know that just incredible to see this this attorney general this traitorous
[01:15:10.840 --> 01:15:29.960]  government blend Spencer your view on fast and furious hey Glenn are you on
[01:15:29.960 --> 01:15:37.600]  a headset it just sounds really really muffled right now
[01:15:37.600 --> 01:15:41.480]  you know we're down here on the Mexican border no no I understand I understand
[01:15:41.480 --> 01:15:46.600]  just worse than usual talk right into that phone for me thank you sir start
[01:15:46.600 --> 01:15:54.000]  over I think it's like me different look and plant and interpretation of fast
[01:15:54.000 --> 01:16:03.120]  and furious almost three years ago I held a press conference at the national
[01:16:03.120 --> 01:16:10.680]  press club in Washington DC to prove that the Mexican drug war was started
[01:16:10.680 --> 01:16:17.160]  when we shut off the Goldwater bombing range the smugglers and we had proof of
[01:16:17.160 --> 01:16:24.640]  it and nobody would listen and since then I've analyzed the data forward to the
[01:16:24.640 --> 01:16:30.200]  border let me tell you something the Mexican drug war was started when we
[01:16:30.200 --> 01:16:35.080]  shut down two of the major corridors that were available for the Sinaloa
[01:16:35.080 --> 01:16:41.440]  cartel that got the cartels going to war with each other but the United States
[01:16:41.440 --> 01:16:46.280]  government doesn't want you to know that because the obvious conclusion if you
[01:16:46.280 --> 01:16:51.680]  found out was finish the fence and cut off the rest of the smuggling corridor
[01:16:51.680 --> 01:16:57.840]  but they don't want to do that they didn't want to blame the Mexican drug war
[01:16:57.840 --> 01:17:03.720]  on our fence they wanted to blame them and divert attention to weapons that's
[01:17:03.720 --> 01:17:07.440]  what this was all about everybody says it's the second amendment that's partly
[01:17:07.440 --> 01:17:12.680]  true but they're trying to blame us for the Mexican drug war when it was
[01:17:12.680 --> 01:17:18.240]  actually started when we cut off two major corridors now you can go to
[01:17:18.240 --> 01:17:24.040]  American Border Patrol dot com and watch my video because I have thrown that
[01:17:24.040 --> 01:17:30.640]  order from the Gulf of Mexico to San Diego at five hundred feet with our
[01:17:30.640 --> 01:17:36.880]  aerial platform a number of times and we watched that fence do it and we watched
[01:17:36.880 --> 01:17:41.280]  what happened but that's that's that's one of the reasons we're blocked out
[01:17:41.280 --> 01:17:46.320]  they don't want the people to see the facts that we have now that's fast and
[01:17:46.320 --> 01:17:50.600]  furious what else do you want to talk about well now you're absolutely right
[01:17:50.600 --> 01:17:55.240]  it it's just incredible to see him going to these links what do you make of
[01:17:55.240 --> 01:17:59.760]  predator drones being used in regular police activity and not on the borders
[01:17:59.760 --> 01:18:04.120]  now you know they've got drones up there they say for drug smuggling but but but
[01:18:04.120 --> 01:18:09.160]  but not for general border security what do you make of this article out of the
[01:18:09.160 --> 01:18:14.680]  LA Times where they're using drones in in the Dakotas with local police
[01:18:14.680 --> 01:18:20.800]  well I'm going to tell you is the absolute truth the only reason they started using
[01:18:20.800 --> 01:18:25.920]  drones on the border was eight years ago almost nine years ago American Border
[01:18:25.920 --> 01:18:31.120]  Patrol developed its own and shown to the unmanned aerial vehicles drones could
[01:18:31.120 --> 01:18:34.880]  be used effectively on the border we demonstrated we had our own I won't go
[01:18:34.880 --> 01:18:39.480]  into all the details we were on national television three times and that's when
[01:18:39.480 --> 01:18:44.360]  they announced they were gonna put the drones on the border our system cost
[01:18:44.360 --> 01:18:50.680]  $50,000 we went out and bought this predator for $18 million when we found
[01:18:50.680 --> 01:18:55.120]  out the FAA wouldn't let them fly at the most of the border areas right now
[01:18:55.120 --> 01:19:00.840]  they have to fly above 19,000 feet their cameras work between 5,000 and 8,000
[01:19:00.840 --> 01:19:08.120]  feet we are a huge waste of money it is a major scandal I have been following for
[01:19:08.120 --> 01:19:12.240]  years now if you go on an American patrol you look at the feature from
[01:19:12.240 --> 01:19:21.080]  yesterday you'll see the typical aircraft that the Border Patrol uses cost them
[01:19:21.080 --> 01:19:26.640]  around $200 for each apprehension that they help make they put these predators
[01:19:26.640 --> 01:19:31.640]  on the border and the reformer head of Customs and Border Patrol aircraft
[01:19:31.640 --> 01:19:39.320]  maintenance so it costs $32,000 per alien apprehension and not $200
[01:19:39.320 --> 01:19:48.640]  $32,000 it is a scandal of biblical proportions now when they do in order to
[01:19:48.640 --> 01:19:53.680]  justify the Border Patrol justify buying these airplanes tell what stay there
[01:19:53.680 --> 01:19:56.840]  and then I want to get your general view on how the globalist plan to get rid of
[01:19:56.840 --> 01:19:59.880]  the borders because we've been defeating them on many many fronts

[01:24:30.440 --> 01:24:34.040]  borders basically Glenn what's your view of the different Republican candidates
[01:24:34.040 --> 01:24:37.600]  well you know we're a nonprofit organization we really can't take a
[01:24:37.600 --> 01:24:44.760]  political stand on on these situations so I have to speak for myself I think
[01:24:44.760 --> 01:24:51.680]  Michelle Bachman has done the best job of it addressing the issue and the rest of
[01:24:51.680 --> 01:24:57.040]  them are far behind and you know by the way the US numbers USA is ranked all of
[01:24:57.040 --> 01:25:02.000]  these candidates agree with it she has the highest rating but what's
[01:25:02.000 --> 01:25:07.040]  incredible is that obviously there's six billion seven hundred million people
[01:25:07.040 --> 01:25:10.160]  that want to come here they get here and the and most of them get put on
[01:25:10.160 --> 01:25:14.440]  welfare that's a fact I mean we're going bankrupt it this is destroyed us it
[01:25:14.440 --> 01:25:18.040]  obviously isn't good I mean do they want a hundred million more people two hundred
[01:25:18.040 --> 01:25:22.360]  million we don't want any borders they don't want the globalist don't want
[01:25:22.360 --> 01:25:28.200]  borders and that's why I'm here on the US Mexico border I don't know how long
[01:25:28.200 --> 01:25:33.360]  it's been since I talked to you but we have developed it we have been testing
[01:25:33.360 --> 01:25:38.640]  new technology here on the border that is going to explode on the national
[01:25:38.640 --> 01:25:44.840]  scene very soon we've been we've had it installed on the border for a year okay
[01:25:44.840 --> 01:25:50.360]  and we've had high tech people down here and they just their eyes pop open their
[01:25:50.360 --> 01:25:57.320]  mouth drop open they see what we have done we have developed technology that
[01:25:57.320 --> 01:26:04.520]  will count detect and count everybody crossing the US Mexico border in real
[01:26:04.520 --> 01:26:12.320]  time and we can do it for less than what we wasted on 50 miles in Arizona
[01:26:12.320 --> 01:26:20.080]  absolutely slam dunk we've done it we can do it and now you just watch what
[01:26:20.080 --> 01:26:23.600]  happens when they try to cover this up but we've got some pretty powerful
[01:26:23.600 --> 01:26:27.920]  people that are looking at it here in Arizona I had a state senator here last
[01:26:27.920 --> 01:26:32.840]  week she is looking at this and that other state senators from Arizona they're
[01:26:32.840 --> 01:26:37.880]  getting behind the project we can feel that border as a matter of fact on an
[01:26:37.880 --> 01:26:42.240]  American border patrol dot com there's a video on there everybody that's watched
[01:26:42.240 --> 01:26:48.040]  it said oh my gosh because it goes into the fact that earlier this year Rand
[01:26:48.040 --> 01:26:52.760]  Corporation one of the leading state tanks in the country came out and
[01:26:52.760 --> 01:26:59.600]  publicly said our government has no idea of how many people are crossing the
[01:26:59.600 --> 01:27:05.240]  border but then meanwhile they've got to set up a checkpoint the middle of the
[01:27:05.240 --> 01:27:09.040]  country and and grab your wife's breast to make sure she's not a terrorist
[01:27:09.040 --> 01:27:12.720]  because it's an imminent threat it while the they're shipping guns into
[01:27:12.720 --> 01:27:17.240]  Mexico it shows the war on terror is a ruse to take the American citizens
[01:27:17.240 --> 01:27:24.720]  rights away it's absolutely clear now Glenn looking at this studying
[01:27:24.720 --> 01:27:29.280]  Mexico and the failed state it is if they don't control the border where do
[01:27:29.280 --> 01:27:33.000]  you see this going in the next five years there's no question what what's
[01:27:33.000 --> 01:27:38.400]  happening is like what's happening right now in California the new census the new
[01:27:38.400 --> 01:27:41.840]  redistricting the benefit the Republicans are going to lose like one
[01:27:41.840 --> 01:27:47.800]  third of their seats we're going to be outvoted right in our own country all
[01:27:47.800 --> 01:27:51.640]  along the border they're going to be flooding across they're going to be
[01:27:51.640 --> 01:27:55.880]  taking over the cops they're going to be heading up the police department heading
[01:27:55.880 --> 01:28:00.840]  up the local county this is going to happen to the point where you no longer
[01:28:00.840 --> 01:28:04.880]  have control of your border and the crossings are going to increase
[01:28:04.880 --> 01:28:11.640]  tremendously well that's what I don't get down on Town Lake in Austin they've
[01:28:11.640 --> 01:28:15.960]  got a big observation point down there if I could take photos of it I could pull
[01:28:15.960 --> 01:28:18.640]  it up and read the name of the observation point you guys run my phone
[01:28:18.640 --> 01:28:23.040]  in here please took photos of it two weeks ago and they've got the Mexican
[01:28:23.040 --> 01:28:28.960]  Eagle there killing an armadillo in its hands instead of a snake and of course
[01:28:28.960 --> 01:28:32.720]  that's saying you know killing Texas and I see this art everywhere and I'm like
[01:28:32.720 --> 01:28:36.640]  I like Hispanic people black white doesn't matter to me my whole issue is
[01:28:36.640 --> 01:28:41.280]  Mexico is a failed narco-terror state why would people who were really US
[01:28:41.280 --> 01:28:46.680]  citizens a lot of them get into this whole a reconquista la infusora and want
[01:28:46.680 --> 01:28:51.000]  to be implode like Mexico and want to have the cops pull you over and shake
[01:28:51.000 --> 01:28:54.280]  you down and want to live like that I mean it's crazy
[01:28:54.280 --> 01:28:59.240]  well you know one of the reasons we talk today they're putting an unmanned
[01:28:59.240 --> 01:29:06.360]  border entry spot down in the national park they're going to spend 12 and a
[01:29:06.360 --> 01:29:11.040]  half million dollars to build a bridge and a port of entry down there you know
[01:29:11.040 --> 01:29:16.840]  how many people it will serve in Mexico 58 there are 58 people who live in that
[01:29:16.840 --> 01:29:21.080]  little town and nobody within a hundred miles so our government is to spend
[01:29:21.080 --> 01:29:25.960]  $30,000 per Mexican so that these people can come into the United States stay
[01:29:25.960 --> 01:29:28.960]  there I want to hear more about this scan on the other side with Glenn Spencer
[01:29:28.960 --> 01:29:36.200]  and then I'll even see if I can Twitter out this photo of the the eagle
[01:29:36.200 --> 01:29:42.000]  killing the armadillo it's I mean I just I have a lot of trouble handling this and
[01:29:42.000 --> 01:29:45.840]  and you can't have the American flag on your shirt and schools in Texas and
[01:29:45.840 --> 01:29:51.600]  California because it's offensive I mean come on we're on the March the

[01:33:29.760 --> 01:33:35.960]  okay my friends we are back live here's Fox News article US proposes unmanned
[01:33:35.960 --> 01:33:41.520]  border entry with Mexico they want to do a test at a place where there won't be a
[01:33:41.520 --> 01:33:45.880]  lot of problems so they can then roll it out everywhere and then just by fiat get
[01:33:45.880 --> 01:33:49.280]  rid of the border patrol agents and allow certain people to bring the drug
[01:33:49.280 --> 01:33:54.840]  packages over again everything is about centralization so the globalists want
[01:33:54.840 --> 01:33:58.920]  that the bloody drug war in Mexico shows no signs of relenting neither do calls
[01:33:58.920 --> 01:34:03.080]  for tighter border security and rising fears of spillover violence this hardly
[01:34:03.080 --> 01:34:07.560]  seems a time the US be willing to allow people to cross the border legally from
[01:34:07.560 --> 01:34:12.560]  Mexico without a customs officer in sight no no that's only for citizens to be
[01:34:12.560 --> 01:34:16.520]  told over and checkpoints and warrantless searches no when the globalist
[01:34:16.520 --> 01:34:22.680]  want open border they get it but in this rugged remote west Texas terrain we're
[01:34:22.680 --> 01:34:27.880]  waiting across the shallow Rio Grande undetected is not too easy federal
[01:34:27.880 --> 01:34:33.440]  authorities are touting a proposal to open an unmanned port of entry as a
[01:34:33.440 --> 01:34:41.360]  security upgrade so they say it's all too easy to get across so we'll just go
[01:34:41.360 --> 01:34:46.200]  ahead and make it easy easier for you with a bridge and it just goes on to talk
[01:34:46.200 --> 01:34:50.600]  about Big Bend National Park allowing people from the tiny Mexican town of
[01:34:50.600 --> 01:34:55.680]  Boquias I've been to Boquias to scan their identity documents and talk to
[01:34:55.680 --> 01:35:00.400]  customs officer another location at least 100 miles away and then they open
[01:35:00.400 --> 01:35:07.120]  the door yeah let me stop right there and we're gonna go back to Glenn Spencer
[01:35:07.120 --> 01:35:13.280]  here I've been to Boquias wow you talk about land of the lost huge caves sand
[01:35:13.280 --> 01:35:17.720]  embankments running down to the Rio Grande incredibly beautiful I mean I
[01:35:17.720 --> 01:35:21.680]  can't describe it here I am trying to describe it we we took a little paddle
[01:35:21.680 --> 01:35:26.520]  boat across you pay the guy in the rowboat a few bucks you get across I
[01:35:26.520 --> 01:35:31.400]  guess I went into Mexico illegally when I was a little kid and there's all these
[01:35:31.400 --> 01:35:36.400]  old wreck cars and stuff and I went into Boquias and they had dirt bottom floors
[01:35:36.400 --> 01:35:43.520]  it looked like an old west town but a real one and just amazing I now digress
[01:35:43.520 --> 01:35:49.480]  going back to Glenn Spencer Glenn what do you make of this why are they doing
[01:35:49.480 --> 01:35:54.280]  this well they say that the people in this little town you know used to shop at
[01:35:54.280 --> 01:36:01.400]  the Rio Grande Village store a couple of miles away across the border and they
[01:36:01.400 --> 01:36:06.800]  bought food there because they don't have electricity in Boquias and so they
[01:36:06.800 --> 01:36:13.200]  want to build this 12 million dollar a bridge and and crossing to serve the
[01:36:13.200 --> 01:36:19.520]  people of Boquias well there's only 58 people who live there so we're gonna
[01:36:19.520 --> 01:36:25.000]  spend 12 million dollars so that they can come by frozen food at the Rio Grande
[01:36:25.000 --> 01:36:30.200]  Village store I it would be cheaper to buy a generator so they can have frozen
[01:36:30.200 --> 01:36:35.760]  food well when I was nine years old there were little paddle boats little
[01:36:35.760 --> 01:36:40.400]  row boats going back and forth people are fishing there I haven't been down
[01:36:40.400 --> 01:36:47.000]  there in the close to 30 years but from from what I read and what you describe
[01:36:47.000 --> 01:36:50.480]  it's still basically the same nobody's stopping those folks from coming across
[01:36:50.480 --> 01:37:19.040]  well that's like the state police are getting six six hundred thousand
[01:37:19.040 --> 01:37:23.000]  dollar boats here to harass people I mean the whole thing is just a joke
[01:37:23.000 --> 01:37:27.800]  government wants to bankrupt the population it's it's it's unspeakable
[01:37:27.800 --> 01:37:33.600]  and it just goes on and on where do you see this high-tech bridge and computer
[01:37:33.600 --> 01:37:37.600]  system going well there are public comments that are going into the
[01:37:37.600 --> 01:37:43.760]  Department of Homeland Security you know in the next before the end of the
[01:37:43.760 --> 01:37:47.960]  month you can read that report I think a lot of people are going to criticize them
[01:37:47.960 --> 01:37:55.400]  you know you you have people who are experts at working documents they're
[01:37:55.400 --> 01:38:00.440]  going to scan a document and then who's going to be reading it you know some
[01:38:00.440 --> 01:38:06.480]  subject patriot at the other end one of these corrupt border patrol agents you
[01:38:06.480 --> 01:38:12.800]  know this is insane what is what is going on here you know about the people
[01:38:12.800 --> 01:38:17.080]  of the town give them a thousand dollars each or five thousand dollars to me
[01:38:17.080 --> 01:38:21.000]  somewhere else for biomed generator there's a lot cheaper ways to help them
[01:38:21.000 --> 01:38:28.600]  out $12 million on a border crossing in the middle of nowhere but there's
[01:38:28.600 --> 01:38:33.400]  nothing down there to begin with I have been to Big Ben in the last decade and
[01:38:33.400 --> 01:38:38.680]  there's nothing down there on the other side it's just any way they can with
[01:38:38.680 --> 01:38:43.320]  these no bid contracts and the rest of it Glen Spencer what about the moves
[01:38:43.320 --> 01:38:48.480]  towards another amnesty plan what's the latest on that
[01:38:48.480 --> 01:38:54.720]  the person who brought that up was Newt Gingrich and but what we have to
[01:38:54.720 --> 01:39:01.680]  understand that what Newt Gingrich is really proposing is not people who have
[01:39:01.680 --> 01:39:08.960]  been here for 25 years but Newt Gingrich came out and endorsed what they
[01:39:08.960 --> 01:39:16.240]  call the red card solution right this is by the Crebel Foundation and the red
[01:39:16.240 --> 01:39:24.720]  card solution is essentially to issue a word card to everybody everybody so that
[01:39:24.720 --> 01:39:30.560]  you don't have anybody illegal anymore and so what they say is in their whole
[01:39:30.560 --> 01:39:36.880]  in their document the Crebel Foundation that that Gingrich has endorsed
[01:39:36.880 --> 01:39:42.400]  understand here is his quote the Crebel Foundation is a very good has a very
[01:39:42.400 --> 01:39:46.520]  good red card program that says you get to be legal but you don't get a path to
[01:39:46.520 --> 01:39:50.080]  citizenship so there's a way that ultimately will end up with a country
[01:39:50.080 --> 01:39:54.760]  but there's no more illegality but you haven't automatically given amnesty to
[01:39:54.760 --> 01:40:01.600]  anyone otherwise you legalize everybody this is what Gingrich has said okay and
[01:40:01.600 --> 01:40:13.400]  that means you can get rid of the border patrol yeah they've actually said
[01:40:13.400 --> 01:40:20.160]  they'll just have them at domestic checkpoints so now we'll be treated yeah
[01:40:20.160 --> 01:40:24.080]  well no glum and I'm explaining is is that Homeland Security is set in
[01:40:24.080 --> 01:40:28.400]  hearings and they've now done it they're gonna have checkpoints hardened but also
[01:40:28.400 --> 01:40:32.400]  roving all over the country where they just want to where they stop you on the
[01:40:32.400 --> 01:40:37.760]  side of the road search you checkpoints shopping malls body scanners I mean
[01:40:37.760 --> 01:40:41.840]  that's like leaving your fortress gates open but then saying you've got armed
[01:40:41.840 --> 01:40:47.440]  guards pointing knives at the throat of the villagers as they sleep inside the
[01:40:47.440 --> 01:41:08.440]  castle no I know Glenn Spencer you're doing a great job thanks for the update
[01:41:08.440 --> 01:41:11.280]  look forward to talking to you again soon thank you thank you there goes
[01:41:11.280 --> 01:41:15.720]  Glenn Spencer great guy he's down there right on the border but I would have him
[01:41:15.720 --> 01:41:18.880]  longer but that phone is worse than worse than it normally is so I'm not
[01:41:18.880 --> 01:41:24.120]  gonna object to subject people to that anymore okay let me just again if you're
[01:41:24.120 --> 01:41:28.800]  a new listener be clear about where I stand on the border situation the
[01:41:28.800 --> 01:41:34.840]  globalist the New World Order the megabanks the United Nations who run
[01:41:34.840 --> 01:41:41.160]  around engaging in every form of pillaging robbing murder you can imagine
[01:41:41.160 --> 01:41:50.080]  are for the end of the family for forced abortion for eugenics medical care
[01:41:50.080 --> 01:41:57.760]  population reduction and they are for disarming the general public and they
[01:41:57.760 --> 01:42:03.200]  run genocides all over the world they are for using food as a weapon and they
[01:42:03.200 --> 01:42:07.440]  are for open borders and so they make it all this thing where Rick Perry's like
[01:42:07.440 --> 01:42:12.920]  it's just you don't have a big heart you've got a hard heart
[01:42:12.920 --> 01:42:20.560]  members quote if you don't give illegals in-state tuition so somebody from
[01:42:20.560 --> 01:42:24.640]  Oklahoma or Louisiana or New Mexico comes to Texas it's the same all over
[01:42:24.640 --> 01:42:29.840]  the country and they've got a pay I was looking it up say for the University of
[01:42:29.840 --> 01:42:35.160]  Texas more than double because they're from Oklahoma or New York or New Jersey
[01:42:35.160 --> 01:42:41.400]  or Michigan or Illinois whatever the cases Kansas Missouri Rhode Island South
[01:42:41.400 --> 01:42:46.840]  Carolina Alabama Florida but that's okay because they're just Americans you
[01:42:46.840 --> 01:42:51.040]  see they've taken this idea of American hospitality to the millionth degree and
[01:42:51.040 --> 01:42:56.040]  political correctness and they say you're going to now because in-state
[01:42:56.040 --> 01:43:00.800]  tuition is taxpayer financed all the state schools including the University of
[01:43:00.800 --> 01:43:06.200]  Texas biggest university in the world most attended that is paid for by
[01:43:06.200 --> 01:43:10.560]  taxpayers and then all the other fees and fines that's just all gravy so they
[01:43:10.560 --> 01:43:15.680]  can you know run their hedge funds and be involved setting up the major radio
[01:43:15.680 --> 01:43:19.800]  networks you hear on the air today you know baseball teams they're involved in
[01:43:19.800 --> 01:43:26.560]  everything just a hedge fund their permanent fund all of it and Rick Perry
[01:43:26.560 --> 01:43:32.840]  says you got to have a heart really if I go down to Mexico do the police have a
[01:43:32.840 --> 01:43:37.040]  heart when they pull my parents over when I was a kid down in southern Mexico and
[01:43:37.040 --> 01:43:40.800]  shake them down for money or or how about have a heart when I'm driving on a
[01:43:40.800 --> 01:43:46.440]  bus to for a tour of Mexico last time I said I intend to go down there I might
[01:43:46.440 --> 01:43:50.880]  still go down there again I like you know the Caribbean and they just pulled
[01:43:50.880 --> 01:43:55.400]  over the bus and shook the driver down he didn't say anything when he got back
[01:43:55.400 --> 01:44:00.440]  on he was basically almost crying but the army just demanded all his money give
[01:44:00.440 --> 01:44:05.680]  it all to me I mean is wow where's the heart there
[01:44:05.680 --> 01:44:10.680]  Mexico admits they have their most draconian immigration laws in this
[01:44:10.680 --> 01:44:20.040]  hemisphere six months to a year hard labor dirt floors first offense I mean
[01:44:20.040 --> 01:44:23.600]  they treat other Latin Americans like absolute garbage and then here's our
[01:44:23.600 --> 01:44:29.680]  country the illegals get here they are on average you look these numbers up two
[01:44:29.680 --> 01:44:33.720]  thirds on welfare on top of working oh yeah they work hard and then the
[01:44:33.720 --> 01:44:36.160]  government wants to give them welfare which the government does why not get
[01:44:36.160 --> 01:44:39.560]  that to why not open up welfare accounts in three different names which the
[01:44:39.560 --> 01:44:43.400]  government encourages as an incentive remember seeing an AP article four or
[01:44:43.400 --> 01:44:47.680]  five years ago where it was the big banks it was the headline you probably pull it
[01:44:47.680 --> 01:44:55.440]  up a red on the air many times it was something like big banks wave regulations
[01:44:55.440 --> 01:45:00.720]  on loans for immigrants and it said well you're here illegally we know it's
[01:45:00.720 --> 01:45:04.040]  tough we're just gonna wave all that I mean I've been to Bank of America years
[01:45:04.040 --> 01:45:10.280]  ago some of our crew has and we went down there and covered it and if you're a
[01:45:10.280 --> 01:45:14.760]  citizen you Hispanic black white Asian whatever you got to show three forms of
[01:45:14.760 --> 01:45:20.000]  ID even if you got a bank account there they want to but if you're any legal it's
[01:45:20.000 --> 01:45:22.640]  just you got a matricula on a piece of paper somebody you can get out of a
[01:45:22.640 --> 01:45:27.160]  cracker jacks box boom it's discriminatory just like the police have
[01:45:27.160 --> 01:45:31.640]  to let the illegals go if they do arrest them they get a five or ten dollar fine
[01:45:31.640 --> 01:45:39.000]  DWI let go aggravated assault let go I mean this is in the news and cops when
[01:45:39.000 --> 01:45:41.840]  I've seen them throwing the book at citizens for petty stuff I say this is
[01:45:41.840 --> 01:45:45.280]  wrong he goes well it's our policy and I'm being recorded and I'm told to do
[01:45:45.280 --> 01:45:50.720]  this to citizens and leave non-citizens alone wow I mean you're there to see
[01:45:50.720 --> 01:45:54.320]  everybody's thinking of discrimination is black versus white or something when
[01:45:54.320 --> 01:45:58.600]  there's all these other forms of it where they shut down your local city on
[01:45:58.600 --> 01:46:03.040]  power plant jack up your prices so some mega company can make more money and
[01:46:03.040 --> 01:46:09.740]  call it environmental how is that not discrimination you see and so the
[01:46:09.740 --> 01:46:14.600]  globalist are four open borders you know my dad goes once a year or so on
[01:46:14.600 --> 01:46:19.120]  aid missions these are dentist and you know they've got all these different
[01:46:19.120 --> 01:46:24.760]  organizations where dentists and doctors go down and do free medical care and
[01:46:24.760 --> 01:46:28.400]  he's been all over me you know the third world doing that but he went to
[01:46:28.400 --> 01:46:33.040]  Paraguay the green hell right in the middle of South America landlocked and
[01:46:33.040 --> 01:46:36.920]  while he was at a soccer game he was telling me about this when I was at his
[01:46:36.920 --> 01:46:40.680]  house this weekend and I googled it on my iPhone and sure enough there it was
[01:46:40.680 --> 01:46:45.480]  London Guardian where the game was canceled he was taken to a game and
[01:46:45.480 --> 01:46:50.400]  somebody threw a stick of dynamite in between the referee on a play that
[01:46:50.400 --> 01:46:54.120]  didn't like blowing the guy back in the air and another person they didn't die
[01:46:54.120 --> 01:46:57.280]  but they had to go to the hospital that's what was going on you don't wear a
[01:46:57.280 --> 01:47:00.080]  watch walking down the street somebody I run up and grab it they said you don't
[01:47:00.080 --> 01:47:03.680]  want to give the kids balloons or any toys all the homeless kids because
[01:47:03.680 --> 01:47:08.760]  they'll get killed or beat up for it and he was there you know doing all this
[01:47:08.760 --> 01:47:11.840]  free dental work he actually donated a bunch of equipment he brought down there
[01:47:11.840 --> 01:47:16.680]  with a group of dentists and doctors he went down there with but while he was
[01:47:16.680 --> 01:47:19.640]  there he was telling me about this and I knew about it so I did a couple hours of
[01:47:19.640 --> 01:47:24.720]  research on it that night when I got home the Amish or the Mennonites out of
[01:47:24.720 --> 01:47:28.920]  Europe and Russia in the last hundred years about 80,000 of them down there and
[01:47:28.920 --> 01:47:32.840]  they supply about half the food to the rest of the population which is tens of
[01:47:32.840 --> 01:47:39.200]  millions and they're up in the north desert area the Chaco which nobody
[01:47:39.200 --> 01:47:42.920]  could ever develop they just want to be left alone and then now they supply half
[01:47:42.920 --> 01:47:47.880]  the food and you know milk eggs cheese everything to the people and the UN has
[01:47:47.880 --> 01:47:51.760]  showed up and it's saying they're environmental evil and trying to shut
[01:47:51.760 --> 01:47:55.160]  them down because they're actually trying to run slave farms in Paraguay and
[01:47:55.160 --> 01:48:00.800]  everywhere you go it's UN non-governmental mafia they did the same thing in
[01:48:00.800 --> 01:48:08.000]  Mexico 25 years ago or so all over Mexico UN biosphere signs the concierge of
[01:48:08.000 --> 01:48:13.760]  the hotel selling you UN land first land ever in Mexico in a loophole in their
[01:48:13.760 --> 01:48:20.040]  Constitution they made where you can buy land from Mexicans who it was stolen
[01:48:20.040 --> 01:48:24.560]  from you know you wonder why there's 30 million Mexicans in Mexico City was like
[01:48:24.560 --> 01:48:27.600]  10 million 20 years ago you wonder why there's Makila Doris all along our
[01:48:27.600 --> 01:48:32.700]  border you wonder why our wages have gone down because the globalists that
[01:48:32.700 --> 01:48:36.960]  run our country have absolutely decimated Mexico and forced the hard-working
[01:48:36.960 --> 01:48:43.440]  smart good indigenous people off their land and then they're sent up to Mexico
[01:48:43.440 --> 01:48:47.200]  City and brainwashed it America did it when it's actually the banks that have
[01:48:47.200 --> 01:48:50.640]  gotten America that did it but but it looks true because in a way it is
[01:48:50.640 --> 01:48:54.600]  America that did it and because we let it the globalists do this and now
[01:48:54.600 --> 01:48:58.840]  they're going to use the people they've uprooted they bring them here fill them
[01:48:58.840 --> 01:49:04.720]  full of anti-us vitriol a reconquista la infesora put them on welfare teach them
[01:49:04.720 --> 01:49:08.600]  guns are bad all the stuff's bad vote for the Democratic Party Communism
[01:49:08.600 --> 01:49:13.960]  basically and that's how the globalists are going to bring the US down and
[01:49:13.960 --> 01:49:17.720]  that's what they've done and then I spent hours researching the Mennonites down
[01:49:17.720 --> 01:49:22.400]  there in Paraguay some of them got there in the 1850s more in the 1820s 30s and
[01:49:22.400 --> 01:49:25.760]  then after World War two some more came because Stalin was kicking everybody
[01:49:25.760 --> 01:49:28.720]  off their farms and not letting you grow your own food and making you have
[01:49:28.720 --> 01:49:32.200]  military service so the Mennonites a lot of them got killed trying to leave but
[01:49:32.200 --> 01:49:36.760]  the Mennonites some of them walked out of Ukraine walked out of Russia got help
[01:49:36.760 --> 01:49:42.960]  from US Mennonites got on ships out of Europe went all the way down landed most
[01:49:42.960 --> 01:49:47.400]  of them ended up dying of typhoid and things I think the pilgrims were half
[01:49:47.400 --> 01:49:52.320]  of them died most of them died and just kept in the desert hand digging wells
[01:49:52.320 --> 01:49:56.200]  hitting saltwater moving on finally finding the biggest aquifer in South
[01:49:56.200 --> 01:50:01.960]  America boom built this whole system kept their culture intact and the UN just
[01:50:01.960 --> 01:50:07.680]  type type UN Mennonites Paraguay the UN is in there battering ramming
[01:50:07.680 --> 01:50:12.720]  batter David Rockefeller's there the bushes bought land just by that area
[01:50:12.720 --> 01:50:16.160]  that's where all the narcotics trafficking is going on this is openly
[01:50:16.160 --> 01:50:22.120]  discussed when my dad was there but you'll research it all of Sun Young Moon
[01:50:22.120 --> 01:50:27.000]  has bought a million acres they're all down there and the UN is coming in
[01:50:27.000 --> 01:50:31.200]  trying to run them Mennonites out and there's all these articles the evil
[01:50:31.200 --> 01:50:36.440]  Mennonites the evil Mennonites they turn the desert green and they're horrible
[01:50:36.440 --> 01:50:41.040]  it's evil it's unsustainable giving the paraglans food it's it's the
[01:50:41.040 --> 01:50:46.400]  populations growing because of these Mennonites the same thing with Qaddafi
[01:50:46.400 --> 01:50:49.960]  wasn't a perfect guy and I don't like him but our government put al Qaeda in
[01:50:49.960 --> 01:50:54.120]  there he was stabilizing all of Africa it only takes a little bit of roads and
[01:50:54.120 --> 01:50:58.080]  infrastructure to build something up and that Western information went into

[02:00:50.080 --> 02:00:55.280]  Utah thanks for holding Tyson you're on the air hi Alex I'm a first-time
[02:00:55.280 --> 02:01:02.880]  caller I just wanted to share a little experience that I had in 2008 I was kind
[02:01:02.880 --> 02:01:07.920]  of what I saw was something that led me to believe that there are either FEMA
[02:01:07.920 --> 02:01:12.520]  camps or detention facilities near my home I was driving down University
[02:01:12.520 --> 02:01:17.000]  Avenue in Provo Utah and as I was driving by a rail yard there were two
[02:01:17.000 --> 02:01:23.160]  pilot cars that pulled out into the street and stopped traffic and as I
[02:01:23.160 --> 02:01:27.680]  watched they they were followed by some semi-traders that were loaded with these
[02:01:27.680 --> 02:01:35.320]  concrete boxes and I naturally quite curious so I followed these semi-traders
[02:01:35.320 --> 02:01:40.760]  to see what they might be hauling and with the pole on both sides of the the
[02:01:40.760 --> 02:01:46.360]  trailers and looked really close and it looked to me like large concrete boxes
[02:01:46.360 --> 02:01:53.600]  each had two steel doors and they had barred windows and no sir they have
[02:01:53.600 --> 02:01:57.280]  those for the last decade the government's been building them as fast as
[02:01:57.280 --> 02:02:02.680]  they can and that's exactly what they have on these general camps and they
[02:02:02.680 --> 02:02:06.160]  have areas where they lock you up they've been photographed many times
[02:02:06.160 --> 02:02:13.200]  they're like old-fashioned jails and this is for just setting up prisons very
[02:02:13.200 --> 02:02:18.320]  very quickly yeah it was it was extremely frightening but see denial
[02:02:18.320 --> 02:02:23.320]  set in after I saw this and I and I totally put it aside until one day you
[02:02:23.320 --> 02:02:27.280]  know less than a year later I was on YouTube and I noticed a video of the
[02:02:27.280 --> 02:02:31.560]  exact same thing that I saw somebody else in my area took photos of this as
[02:02:31.560 --> 02:02:35.320]  they were being unloaded and loaded onto the trailers yeah I forget what you
[02:02:35.320 --> 02:02:40.360]  call them a mobile mobile jails concrete jails they've been photoed and
[02:02:40.360 --> 02:02:45.760]  videoed all over the country and they are at some of these decommissioned bases
[02:02:45.760 --> 02:02:48.720]  but none of this is rumors now they admit they're hiring the internment
[02:02:48.720 --> 02:02:52.200]  specialist they've built the camps now they're moving to have groups on
[02:02:52.200 --> 02:02:56.520]  standby to man them that is all official and the mainstream media will not
[02:02:56.520 --> 02:03:00.240]  touch it because they are complicit just like they won't say corezines a crook
[02:03:00.240 --> 02:03:05.240]  they are complicit in the organized crime takeover of America but there's
[02:03:05.240 --> 02:03:08.160]  still a lot of free speech there's still a lot of good people in the country and
[02:03:08.160 --> 02:03:14.160]  folks are waking up yeah if the viewers will type in portable prisons in Utah
[02:03:14.160 --> 02:03:18.640]  what I saw will pop up and you can see the guys type in portable prisons Utah
[02:03:18.640 --> 02:03:21.840]  for me please we'll put that on screen yeah if you're a prison planet dot TV
[02:03:21.840 --> 02:03:26.000]  area able to see this but everybody else yeah portable prisons Utah I've seen
[02:03:26.000 --> 02:03:30.280]  it all over the country in fact some of these we know have been loaded on ships
[02:03:30.280 --> 02:03:35.600]  and taken overseas we know they have these there was a massacre less than a
[02:03:35.600 --> 02:03:39.560]  year into the Afghan invasion where they put in one night three thousand people
[02:03:39.560 --> 02:03:44.240]  in these standing room only and then it's like it's a form of crucifixion to
[02:03:44.240 --> 02:03:48.400]  where you couldn't breathe and you couldn't lay down and it killed them all
[02:03:48.400 --> 02:03:53.720]  within three days do you imagine how painful that is they they cram you in
[02:03:53.720 --> 02:03:56.680]  people don't know what's happening when it's happening they it's a form of
[02:03:56.680 --> 02:04:03.840]  murder it's an old-fashioned form of killing and they cram you in and I see
[02:04:03.840 --> 02:04:07.240]  the photo there's even more powerful ones that show the show the bars I don't
[02:04:07.240 --> 02:04:12.880]  even know if that's what those are but looks like prefab something and they
[02:04:12.880 --> 02:04:17.520]  they cram you in standing until it's like the phone booth came and then they
[02:04:17.520 --> 02:04:22.360]  close the door and it's like you're gonna die now they just walk off and leave
[02:04:22.360 --> 02:04:29.640]  and I remember it came out was in BBC and AP that when they did this after three
[02:04:29.640 --> 02:04:34.080]  days they opened the doors to create a mass grave and some one guy was alive
[02:04:34.080 --> 02:04:37.720]  and ran off and they machine gun damn but then it they had to write a report on

[02:09:03.640 --> 02:09:11.160]  that we have but you know I think the fact that you break down the issue that
[02:09:11.160 --> 02:09:17.560]  the system knows what they're doing I mean a great example is breast cancer we
[02:09:17.560 --> 02:09:23.880]  know what's going on with breast cancer we know that they always talk about hey
[02:09:23.880 --> 02:09:27.640]  let's find a cure for it instead of asking why does the US lead the world
[02:09:27.640 --> 02:09:31.640]  in it and every other form of cancer instead of finding out why we're
[02:09:31.640 --> 02:09:35.040]  getting cancer they just talk about treating it once you get it and I think
[02:09:35.040 --> 02:09:38.920]  with that statement that opens up the door to understand the fact that they
[02:09:38.920 --> 02:09:42.160]  want to treat the illness they don't want to stop you from getting the illness
[02:09:42.160 --> 02:09:46.640]  well do you ever wonder why drug companies and Kentucky fried chicken and
[02:09:46.640 --> 02:09:51.520]  and fast food operations sponsor things like race for the cure and the Susan
[02:09:51.520 --> 02:09:57.880]  B. Coleman Foundation is sponsored by drug companies and sponsored by the people
[02:09:57.880 --> 02:10:01.960]  who produce foods and people who produce products that are linked to breast
[02:10:01.960 --> 02:10:06.520]  cancer I mean what's the logic there why would a drug company that's making
[02:10:06.520 --> 02:10:12.200]  drugs to fight breast cancer supposedly fight breast cancer what would be what
[02:10:12.200 --> 02:10:15.560]  would be there why would there what would be their vested interest in keeping
[02:10:15.560 --> 02:10:18.280]  breast cancer in the public consciousness why would they want people to be
[02:10:18.280 --> 02:10:21.560]  terrified of breast cancer why would they want to keep bringing up breast
[02:10:21.560 --> 02:10:25.800]  cancer every way everywhere you turn it's in order to get people paranoid
[02:10:25.800 --> 02:10:29.200]  enough freaked out enough that they participate in the medical model and
[02:10:29.200 --> 02:10:32.440]  that's the problem with breast cancer you don't hear people talking about to
[02:10:32.440 --> 02:10:35.560]  take care of breast cancer changing your essential fatty acids not eating fast
[02:10:35.560 --> 02:10:39.960]  food not eating Kentucky fried chicken not participating in the kinds of things
[02:10:39.960 --> 02:10:43.560]  that cause breast cancer they talk about treating breast cancer they talk about
[02:10:43.560 --> 02:10:46.240]  curing breast cancer but they don't talk about not participating in the things
[02:10:46.240 --> 02:10:50.320]  that cause the breast cancer breast cancer and by running all the different
[02:10:50.320 --> 02:10:53.160]  movements and having the different races and things with well-meaning people
[02:10:53.160 --> 02:10:57.400]  they then control the whole debate about it to make sure that information is
[02:10:57.400 --> 02:11:01.080]  never discovered they act like they're the knights in shining armor they act
[02:11:01.080 --> 02:11:03.600]  like they're the saviors they act like they're the people who are going to save
[02:11:03.600 --> 02:11:06.680]  you from the breast cancer but let's look at the facts we now anybody can just
[02:11:06.680 --> 02:11:12.640]  search this it's a fact lead the world in cancer of every type including breast
[02:11:12.640 --> 02:11:18.320]  cancer and every industrialized nations that has the vaccines the GMO the
[02:11:18.320 --> 02:11:22.720]  monosodium glutamate that they base this fast food in that's where you see this
[02:11:22.720 --> 02:11:27.880]  going on and places where it's not happening they have the intensifying
[02:11:27.880 --> 02:11:31.400]  longevity that's right breast cancer prostate cancer these are diseases of
[02:11:31.400 --> 02:11:35.160]  lifestyle these are diseases of the way we participate in our lives they're not
[02:11:35.160 --> 02:11:40.000]  inevitable you don't have to get cancer they're the signs of a dysfunctional
[02:11:40.000 --> 02:11:43.360]  culture the signs of dysfunctional lifestyle choices okay I want to get
[02:11:43.360 --> 02:11:47.880]  into all this with you here today because you're here in studio with us but
[02:11:47.880 --> 02:11:52.640]  before we go any further I'd like you to tell folks about your awakening where
[02:11:52.640 --> 02:11:57.800]  you came from your process units now you know being a leading person out there
[02:11:57.800 --> 02:12:01.320]  exposing all this I'm a pharmacist and let me tell you something pharmacists
[02:12:01.320 --> 02:12:04.960]  know how the sausage is made as a registered pharmacist one of the things
[02:12:04.960 --> 02:12:09.000]  that I saw was that the people who are getting the drugs are the people who
[02:12:09.000 --> 02:12:14.520]  can least stand the drugs old people sick people and young people those are the
[02:12:14.520 --> 02:12:16.640]  people who are taking most of the prescription medicines one of the things
[02:12:16.640 --> 02:12:20.400]  pharmacists study and we study this at length is side effects we study
[02:12:20.400 --> 02:12:28.120]  toxicities we study we study medicines we study diseases and we study side
[02:12:28.120 --> 02:12:32.840]  effects of toxicity side effects of medications to the extent where one time
[02:12:32.840 --> 02:12:37.840]  I watched a movie in pharmacy school where where the movie was promoting a
[02:12:37.840 --> 02:12:41.160]  new class of medications that was supposed to revolutionize heart disease
[02:12:41.160 --> 02:12:44.760]  and the movie lasted 60 minutes and 50 minutes 15 minutes was about how
[02:12:44.760 --> 02:12:48.640]  wonderful the the new drug was a new class of drugs it was for that was
[02:12:48.640 --> 02:12:52.200]  going to combat high blood pressure and the last 45 minutes was the side effects
[02:12:52.200 --> 02:12:56.320]  caused by the medication and when I saw things like this I realized that wait a
[02:12:56.320 --> 02:13:00.600]  minute there's something wrong with this pharmaceutical model then in pharmacy
[02:13:00.600 --> 02:13:05.360]  school we study diseases as if they were nutritional deficiencies and we study
[02:13:05.360 --> 02:13:09.680]  medications as if are we studying nutrients as if they were medications so
[02:13:09.680 --> 02:13:14.320]  when you combine the fact that on the one hand you have diseases as the
[02:13:14.320 --> 02:13:17.440]  manifestations of nutritional deficiencies and on the other hand you
[02:13:17.440 --> 02:13:22.160]  have medicinal properties to vitamin A and vitamin C and to vitamin E it kind
[02:13:22.160 --> 02:13:25.840]  of makes sense that why the heck are we using pharmaceuticals with their side
[02:13:25.840 --> 02:13:30.080]  effects when our what we're treating is really in many cases deficiency states
[02:13:30.080 --> 02:13:33.880]  and the medicines that we could use to treat the deficient deficiency states
[02:13:33.880 --> 02:13:37.920]  are completely non-toxic they're completely side effect free and they're
[02:13:37.920 --> 02:13:43.280]  literally literally the cures to the deficiency diseases by definition a
[02:13:43.280 --> 02:13:48.400]  deficiency disease is cured by the nutrient that you give to fill up the
[02:13:48.400 --> 02:13:51.640]  deficiency so when I graduated pharmacy school and I saw the people are getting
[02:13:51.640 --> 02:13:54.840]  all these medications were sicker than ever before I combined that with my
[02:13:54.840 --> 02:13:59.200]  pharmacy our life expectancy is now falling it's falling it's like 26th now
[02:13:59.200 --> 02:14:04.360]  if I but let me add if you as you know but I've seen the actuaries on this up
[02:14:04.360 --> 02:14:09.320]  until even the 20s and 30s if you lived past about five and then you took that
[02:14:09.320 --> 02:14:13.200]  infant mortality out because kids did die more often then if you took the
[02:14:13.200 --> 02:14:19.000]  infant mortality out longevity was way further than it is now I mean this they
[02:14:19.000 --> 02:14:22.480]  know exactly what they're doing even when that when the settlers came to the
[02:14:22.480 --> 02:14:26.560]  new world from Europe they had higher life expectancies when they came here
[02:14:26.560 --> 02:14:31.800]  from Europe when Europe was trashed when the settlers came here in the 1600s and
[02:14:31.800 --> 02:14:35.720]  the 1700s the 1500s Europe had been trashed for almost a thousand years when
[02:14:35.720 --> 02:14:39.120]  they came here to the new world and all of a sudden they had fresh air and they
[02:14:39.120 --> 02:14:44.500]  had wonderful agriculture and they had a great fish and they had all kinds of
[02:14:44.500 --> 02:14:50.680]  game their life expectancy was 75 80 years old and this is in the 1700s we
[02:14:50.680 --> 02:14:55.560]  had higher life expectancies so the fact of the matter is is that we're not sick
[02:14:55.560 --> 02:14:59.760]  we're starving and what I saw as a pharmacist when I started to dispense
[02:14:59.760 --> 02:15:02.560]  Medicaid when I started dispense nutrients to people who had been on
[02:15:02.560 --> 02:15:07.560]  medication I saw blood pressure drop I saw weight drop I saw the markers of
[02:15:07.560 --> 02:15:11.120]  diabetes improved using nutritional supplements and I just put one and one
[02:15:11.120 --> 02:15:14.240]  together and I started using nutritional supplements in my practice and I've been
[02:15:14.240 --> 02:15:18.240]  doing it for now close to 30 years Mike Adams talks about being a computer
[02:15:18.240 --> 02:15:24.080]  program member you know very successful and being really unhealthy and he got
[02:15:24.080 --> 02:15:28.040]  off the fast food and stuff and he's he got better right away and then now he's
[02:15:28.040 --> 02:15:31.480]  in super good shape and and and incredibly healthy it's not hard to do
[02:15:31.480 --> 02:15:34.880]  but you know what Alex people think it's a miracle because we have been so
[02:15:34.880 --> 02:15:39.560]  conditioned to believe that our bodies demise is inevitable we've been so
[02:15:39.560 --> 02:15:42.840]  conditioned to believe that oh you're 30 or 35 you're just gonna get arthritis
[02:15:42.840 --> 02:15:46.760]  oh you're 30 or 35 you're just gonna have a fatty liver do you know 30% of
[02:15:46.760 --> 02:15:49.920]  Americans suffer from fatty liver disease maybe more and if you go to the
[02:15:49.920 --> 02:15:52.640]  doctor and he says oh you got a little fatty liver you know what he'll tell you
[02:15:52.640 --> 02:15:57.800]  he'll say it's normal because the medical model says that our demise is
[02:15:57.800 --> 02:16:01.960]  normal and the only thing we can do is stave it off stimp symptomatic
[02:16:01.960 --> 02:16:06.000]  how do you reverse a fatty liver? Lots of ways and that's what I'll tell you in a
[02:16:06.000 --> 02:16:09.720]  second but that's a great question because there are so many different ways
[02:16:09.720 --> 02:16:13.480]  to reverse these signs fatty liver I'll just give you a couple good examples
[02:16:13.480 --> 02:16:18.280]  fructose fruit sugar is processed directly by the liver in the last 30 or
[02:16:18.280 --> 02:16:21.920]  40 years we've gone from zero consumption of high fructose corn syrup to
[02:16:21.920 --> 02:16:26.680]  roughly 60 pounds of high consumption per person in this country and that
[02:16:26.680 --> 02:16:29.200]  doesn't include the fructose that we get from today and they know it converts
[02:16:29.200 --> 02:16:33.080]  differently and verse in the liver it's pro and then it blocks key endocrine's
[02:16:33.080 --> 02:16:36.680]  correct well the liver produces all kinds of hormones but the point is is
[02:16:36.680 --> 02:16:40.840]  that fructose is processed directly by the liver paleologically we didn't grow
[02:16:40.840 --> 02:16:44.200]  up with fructose the human body grew up in the African savannah there was no
[02:16:44.200 --> 02:16:47.240]  fructose on the African savannah we were lucky if we found a little bit of
[02:16:47.240 --> 02:16:50.920]  berries somewhere that didn't have a lot of sugar in it but what's happened over
[02:16:50.920 --> 02:16:54.760]  the last six years 50 or 60 years I think it was in the early 70s when we
[02:16:54.760 --> 02:16:57.640]  started to get into a lot of high fructose corn syrup is our ingestion of
[02:16:57.640 --> 02:17:01.520]  this stuff has skyrocketed and look at diabetes and the body can't handle it
[02:17:01.520 --> 02:17:04.960]  it's up several thousand percentage points absurd and in pharmacy school when
[02:17:04.960 --> 02:17:09.200]  I graduated in 1986 they told us this was going to happen today one out of three
[02:17:09.200 --> 02:17:12.400]  Americans is either diabetic or pre-diabetic and instead it was an
[02:17:12.400 --> 02:17:16.120]  actuary of let's go make a bunch of money off this well here's a very
[02:17:16.120 --> 02:17:21.440]  important point Alex we treat things at the top of the tree the root is usually
[02:17:21.440 --> 02:17:25.400]  in the digestive system the blood sugar system and the adrenal system and from
[02:17:25.400 --> 02:17:29.080]  there you get heart disease from there you get cancer from there you get skin
[02:17:29.080 --> 02:17:32.320]  diseases from there you get all the diseases that we're treating with drugs
[02:17:32.320 --> 02:17:36.280]  there at the top of the tree if you want to treat disease you have to go to the
[02:17:36.280 --> 02:17:40.120]  root and that means the digestive system the blood sugar system and the
[02:17:40.120 --> 02:17:43.880]  adrenal system which is connected to the thyroid when we're born Alex human
[02:17:43.880 --> 02:17:46.920]  beings are born with big heads because we're smarter than other animals we have
[02:17:46.920 --> 02:17:51.120]  big heads so we come out of the womb early because the head can't has to come
[02:17:51.120 --> 02:17:54.760]  through the the birth canal so nature is designed a system where we come out of
[02:17:54.760 --> 02:17:58.680]  the womb early that means that our digestive system and our immune system
[02:17:58.680 --> 02:18:03.320]  are immature so nature is designed a system where mother's milk human breast
[02:18:03.320 --> 02:18:06.800]  milk will provide factors that build your digestive system in your immune
[02:18:06.800 --> 02:18:10.880]  system if you're born without getting breastfed or you're not breastfed long
[02:18:10.880 --> 02:18:14.520]  enough or your mother was undernourished and that basically covers it just about
[02:18:14.520 --> 02:18:18.520]  everybody that's why our cues are dropping that you're immediately you're
[02:18:18.520 --> 02:18:22.080]  immune and they knew when they fed babies that most this formula is half
[02:18:22.080 --> 02:18:27.920]  corn syrup half they some are 60 plus they know this is literally a death
[02:18:27.920 --> 02:18:31.400]  sentence to their brain that's why so many of these adults and people it's
[02:18:31.400 --> 02:18:35.000]  like you're not even talking to a person well they are they are they are
[02:18:35.000 --> 02:18:38.680]  mentally retarded so how do you deal with something like that well first of
[02:18:38.680 --> 02:18:41.680]  all you got to have a lot of motivation you got to be motivated to make a change
[02:18:41.680 --> 02:18:45.960]  but the gift of the human body Alex is it will turn on a dime if you turn on a
[02:18:45.960 --> 02:18:49.080]  dime but I'm going back to the viciousness of the system when they
[02:18:49.080 --> 02:18:52.320]  said women you all got to go work and by the way here's this thing for your
[02:18:52.320 --> 02:18:59.880]  baby and it is a formula a formula for a 85 IQ low grade moron and that's who the
[02:18:59.880 --> 02:19:04.560]  general public thank God my mother breastfed me you're lucky I mean thank
[02:19:04.560 --> 02:19:09.640]  God and I've seen the studies where the cc size of the brain doesn't even grow
[02:19:09.640 --> 02:19:13.360]  to your genetic cranial size when you don't get those fats because you're
[02:19:13.360 --> 02:19:17.480]  designed to get that fat from your mother and now they're saying don't let
[02:19:17.480 --> 02:19:21.520]  babies have fat in their milk and they're saying give them you know it's
[02:19:21.520 --> 02:19:25.400]  absolutely we need to give them statins at birth well cholesterol breast milk has
[02:19:25.400 --> 02:19:29.280]  some of the highest concentrations of cholesterol in on the planet is in human
[02:19:29.280 --> 02:19:32.560]  breast milk and the brain's made out of cholesterol well the neural sheaths the
[02:19:32.560 --> 02:19:35.640]  cover of the nerves are made out of cholesterol is exactly right that whole
[02:19:35.640 --> 02:19:40.480]  statin drug thing that's another scandal oh my god but again but again the
[02:19:40.480 --> 02:19:43.840]  Rockefellers who funded the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute they had discovered
[02:19:43.840 --> 02:19:48.160]  all this they knew cancer was viral but at the shots they knew you need cholesterol
[02:19:48.160 --> 02:19:52.120]  get it out of the population they literally are turning us into zombies
[02:19:52.120 --> 02:19:55.680]  stay there let's break this down the other side pharmacist Ben Fuchs is our

[02:24:37.840 --> 02:24:43.440]  second part later in the week but at the same time of course i am always
[02:24:43.440 --> 02:24:47.760]  promoting whatever i'm getting into whether it's gold whether it's the
[02:24:47.760 --> 02:24:52.200]  second amendment whether it's ron paul been supporting ron paul for 17 years

[02:24:55.720 --> 02:25:01.760]  for 12 years and it's gone from gold 260 dollars an ounce to 1700 plus silver
[02:25:01.760 --> 02:25:07.760]  from $5 an ounce to 30 plus and i am promoting this tangy tangerine beyond
[02:25:07.760 --> 02:25:10.880]  tangy tangerine my mother i gave her some of this she's on the vitamins of
[02:25:10.880 --> 02:25:15.040]  minerals she's a big exercise person she tried some stuff over the years she did
[02:25:15.040 --> 02:25:19.520]  it now she begs for me to get her more and has lost a ton of weight and she
[02:25:19.520 --> 02:25:22.720]  says before when she would do long distance swimming sometimes it would get
[02:25:22.720 --> 02:25:26.560]  kind of painful like her muscles were kind of you know i almost catching now
[02:25:26.560 --> 02:25:30.600]  she says it's like they're oiled and my mom just i was always in great shape
[02:25:30.600 --> 02:25:34.440]  she's in killer shape now i know there's some in me in me a basketball players i
[02:25:34.440 --> 02:25:38.160]  saw online right but actually take this and say they are out with the or outlet
[02:25:38.160 --> 02:25:42.280]  yeah he says he has longevity because of this right and then there's pollen
[02:25:42.280 --> 02:25:47.080]  burst which i also take but it's got some what 70 milligrams of the caffeine in
[02:25:47.080 --> 02:25:50.160]  it so instead of that afternoon coffee that didn't even do anything anymore i
[02:25:50.160 --> 02:25:54.000]  just hit one of these bad boys and it's called a b vitamins and it's awesome but
[02:25:54.000 --> 02:25:58.120]  quite frankly it's the tangy tangerine and like you said the worse off you are
[02:25:58.120 --> 02:26:01.080]  because i was in really bad shape from overworking and not being healthy the
[02:26:01.080 --> 02:26:06.240]  worse you are the better you feel it just immediately now i brought Aaron in
[02:26:06.240 --> 02:26:10.240]  here i drug him during the break was not even two mics set up and i called me
[02:26:10.240 --> 02:26:14.200]  there 30 seconds for it look at Aaron ladies and gentlemen done done done i
[02:26:14.200 --> 02:26:18.520]  got a big weekend zoom in over here with this camera Aaron you had to have lost
[02:26:18.520 --> 02:26:22.720]  60 pounds yeah that's awesome probably 64 that's awesome that's awesome bro good
[02:26:22.720 --> 02:26:27.920]  job good job it was hard not really i mean i've been i've been working out a
[02:26:27.920 --> 02:26:31.000]  lot harder before and didn't lose the weight it was when i took the right
[02:26:31.000 --> 02:26:34.960]  vitamins is awesome that's right he was running jogging and lifting weights and
[02:26:34.960 --> 02:26:38.440]  i said Aaron i'm getting fat you're getting a little overweight i said let's
[02:26:38.440 --> 02:26:41.960]  commit to work out what about a year or two years ago and you'd leave work to go
[02:26:41.960 --> 02:26:45.680]  work out and come back it didn't work didn't work for me as soon as you start
[02:26:45.680 --> 02:26:50.120]  going late i'm gonna take a protein shake yeah because then in my body isn't
[02:26:50.120 --> 02:26:53.280]  hungry don't fight the craving or i'm gonna take a mineral drink yeah it's
[02:26:53.280 --> 02:26:56.280]  over i mean i've only been really doing this for two and a half weeks now i kept
[02:26:56.280 --> 02:26:59.080]  eating around the edges screwing around i've been doing this two and a half weeks
[02:26:59.080 --> 02:27:04.520]  and actually i went 11 pounds lost 11 pounds on tangy tangerine and the one
[02:27:04.520 --> 02:27:09.120]  world why it happens to everybody alex i can't tell you how many times i've seen
[02:27:09.120 --> 02:27:12.280]  this happen the reason i get so passionate about this is because i've
[02:27:12.280 --> 02:27:17.080]  seen it over and over and over again blood pressure and the system knows the
[02:27:17.080 --> 02:27:20.360]  system knows have to know it's biochemistry what i'm telling you here's
[02:27:20.360 --> 02:27:24.920]  not my theory this is biochemistry there's hard wiring for sugar in your
[02:27:24.920 --> 02:27:28.920]  brain if you give your body protein you won't want the sugar there's hard
[02:27:28.920 --> 02:27:32.840]  wiring for fat in your brain if you give your body essential fatty acids you
[02:27:32.840 --> 02:27:36.400]  won't want the french fries there's hardwiring for minerals if you give your
[02:27:36.400 --> 02:27:40.320]  body good minerals you won't want to solve ted anderson's dad couldn't go
[02:27:40.320 --> 02:27:42.280]  fishing and didn't know who he was anymore
[02:27:42.280 --> 02:27:46.280]  ted for a few months got him on tangy tangerine essential fatty acids he knew
[02:27:46.280 --> 02:27:49.360]  he wasn't going to go fishing he was back he went to the doctor the medical
[02:27:49.360 --> 02:27:53.760]  doctor said i've tested his blood and because he's on cumatin he's not allowed
[02:27:53.760 --> 02:27:57.000]  to have these vitamins like this take him off and he's gone again they take
[02:27:57.000 --> 02:28:00.800]  that gave me permission to tell this they take you off a broccoli they take you
[02:28:00.800 --> 02:28:04.280]  off of they take you off of cruciferous vegetables because they have that's
[02:28:04.280 --> 02:28:07.680]  what they said that's what they said no no green vegetables that's what they
[02:28:07.680 --> 02:28:12.120]  tell you you're on vitamin k and he's gone and i hate to be mean but Ted says
[02:28:12.120 --> 02:28:15.440]  i can tell it his mother says we're doing what the doctor says and it's
[02:28:15.440 --> 02:28:20.000]  basically bye bye to Ted's dad when it worked in a couple months his dad was
[02:28:20.000 --> 02:28:25.320]  literally back they know the doctor knows biocap they know that's what they

[02:34:14.720 --> 02:34:19.400]  in the morning and then I'm not as hungry all day and then at night instead of
[02:34:19.400 --> 02:34:24.960]  picking out bam I just have that and and and it's amazing two and a half weeks
[02:34:24.960 --> 02:34:29.840]  11 pounds and I've been jogging I've been lifting weights and it wasn't doing
[02:34:29.840 --> 02:34:35.200]  anything my muscles just got bigger tell us what is in the beyond tangy
[02:34:35.200 --> 02:34:37.720]  tangerine I'll tell you what's in there but the most important part about the
[02:34:37.720 --> 02:34:42.520]  beyond tangy tangerine is its liquid and the body processes liquids difference
[02:34:42.520 --> 02:34:45.840]  differently than a process is solid when you eat a solid food the digestive
[02:34:45.840 --> 02:34:50.160]  process has to kick in when you drink a liquid it goes right to work and because
[02:34:50.160 --> 02:34:54.520]  almost 70 million maybe more Americans have digestive problems if you drink
[02:34:54.520 --> 02:34:58.320]  your nutrients you bypass any kind of issues that you have with the digestive
[02:34:58.320 --> 02:35:02.040]  system the stuff goes right to work and that's the most beautiful thing about
[02:35:02.040 --> 02:35:05.160]  that stuff is you feel it really quickly because it's going right to work
[02:35:05.160 --> 02:35:11.000]  we're gonna show a photo of Aaron just in Switzerland in June six months ago
[02:35:11.000 --> 02:35:15.800]  the night when he interviews you versus what he looks like now looks like another
[02:35:15.800 --> 02:35:19.320]  person doesn't yeah looks like a second person you're gonna see the old Alex
[02:35:19.320 --> 02:35:25.200]  Jones to I'm going all the way down at my biggest years ago I was 270 and then I
[02:35:25.200 --> 02:35:30.160]  went down to about 240 just running and lifting and not eating and then couldn't
[02:35:30.160 --> 02:35:34.200]  do it anymore went back up about 250 now I'm going down like 238 but I'm gonna go
[02:35:34.200 --> 02:35:40.080]  all the way down to 180 I'm doing it I am going to 180 can I do it Aaron sure
[02:35:40.080 --> 02:35:42.880]  of course we've all got to do it in the fight against the New World Order you're
[02:35:42.880 --> 02:35:47.320]  not going to be able to withstand cravings which just willpower alone the
[02:35:47.320 --> 02:35:51.800]  drives are built into your brain for these things for many years for for eons
[02:35:51.800 --> 02:35:56.120]  we linked calories with nutrition today we get calories without nutrition so our
[02:35:56.120 --> 02:36:00.720]  brain says that wasn't it go get some more calories expecting to get nutrients
[02:36:00.720 --> 02:36:03.840]  with the cup with those calories but it doesn't happen but you hit it with a way
[02:36:03.840 --> 02:36:07.800]  shake hit it with nutrients goodbye yes tell folks what's in way and why it's so
[02:36:07.800 --> 02:36:12.440]  good way is ridiculously important in fact next to human mother's milk way
[02:36:12.440 --> 02:36:17.160]  protein is the old and eggs maybe way protein is the most nutrient dense food
[02:36:17.160 --> 02:36:21.560]  for that's cow milk protein well it's one of the proteins in cows milk there's
[02:36:21.560 --> 02:36:27.760]  two major proteins in cows milk Cassine and way the way part of milk contains
[02:36:27.760 --> 02:36:32.080]  growth factors and immune stimulating factors building the immune system you're
[02:36:32.080 --> 02:36:35.800]  talking about cancer the body has cancer fighters built into it the body has
[02:36:35.800 --> 02:36:40.080]  molecules and entities that kill cancer and that that's those are part of the
[02:36:40.080 --> 02:36:45.040]  immune system when you drink way protein the the globulence of proteins in the way
[02:36:45.040 --> 02:36:49.160]  protein that are supposed to build the cows immunity the calves immunity go
[02:36:49.160 --> 02:36:55.360]  into your me by the way and build your immune I'm not joking about a month ago
[02:36:55.360 --> 02:36:59.520]  we started getting regularly in the office raw milk from San Antonio from a
[02:36:59.520 --> 02:37:04.320]  farm down there and we added it with the way protein yeah and I'm not kidding I
[02:37:04.320 --> 02:37:06.720]  looked around the people we've been drinking some working up around I said
[02:37:06.720 --> 02:37:11.080]  I said are you high huh and we're like was it yeah this is not placebo we didn't
[02:37:11.080 --> 02:37:15.800]  say drink it we're gonna feel high yeah I literally get high off of it I mean like
[02:37:15.800 --> 02:37:20.560]  high like whoa because I think that raw milk then activates the cold-pressed way
[02:37:20.560 --> 02:37:25.080]  well way protein has got everything you need to build things to build muscle to
[02:37:25.080 --> 02:37:28.480]  build tissue so if you're weightlifting if you're fighting a disease if you're
[02:37:28.480 --> 02:37:32.400]  recovering from something way protein has all of the factors that are required
[02:37:32.400 --> 02:37:35.680]  for your body to build but you know what I'm talking about I mean I guess I was so
[02:37:35.680 --> 02:37:40.680]  undernourished the drinking raw milk with way in it I mean it is not like the
[02:37:40.680 --> 02:37:44.600]  same high you get drinking a Coca-Cola that's got corn syrup in it I mean it
[02:37:44.600 --> 02:37:48.400]  was like I felt really good well way protein contains something called tryptophan
[02:37:48.400 --> 02:37:52.400]  tryptophan is an amino acid that's involved number one in the neurotransmitter
[02:37:52.400 --> 02:37:57.000]  serotonin which makes you really happy really relaxed and number two in the
[02:37:57.000 --> 02:38:00.520]  hormone melatonin and both serotonin and melatonin are not only important for
[02:38:00.520 --> 02:38:04.720]  mood stabilization they're important for plugging into spirituality for plugging
[02:38:04.720 --> 02:38:08.560]  into the big picture via the pineal gland pineal gland is this tiny little
[02:38:08.560 --> 02:38:12.040]  gland that sits in the middle of your head and it processes serotonin and
[02:38:12.040 --> 02:38:15.080]  melatonin and serotonin and melatonin if you ever take melatonin you know you
[02:38:15.080 --> 02:38:19.000]  have great dreams are involved somehow in our connection with spirituality and
[02:38:19.000 --> 02:38:22.800]  so when you take tryptophan when you take things that have tryptophan you
[02:38:22.800 --> 02:38:26.640]  stabilize and you help promote melatonin serotonin metabolism not only
[02:38:26.640 --> 02:38:30.320]  make you feel happy doesn't make you feel blissful and it makes you feel
[02:38:30.320 --> 02:38:33.800]  plugged in it makes you feel connected makes you feel like there's something
[02:38:33.800 --> 02:38:37.800]  going on in a big picture kind of sense which is why they want you on Prozac and
[02:38:37.800 --> 02:38:41.400]  not on tryptophan I was about to say because is so tryptophan I've heard is
[02:38:41.400 --> 02:38:45.160]  called the natural Prozac it's the natural Prozac but it works via this
[02:38:45.160 --> 02:38:48.880]  connection with the pineal but I mean what a surprise God gives us cows we're
[02:38:48.880 --> 02:38:52.640]  drinking the real thing it got the globalists are so evil they take
[02:38:52.640 --> 02:38:56.400]  everything good away oh check this out fluoride is specific for the pineal
[02:38:56.400 --> 02:39:00.440]  gland fluoride is specific for the gland that is involved in serotonin and
[02:39:00.440 --> 02:39:05.680]  melatonin metabolism the the pineal gland fluoridates it absorbs fluoride
[02:39:05.680 --> 02:39:09.400]  more than or almost as much as any other system in the body and the pineal
[02:39:09.400 --> 02:39:12.800]  gland is your connection and so does the thyroid what is this well what is the
[02:39:12.800 --> 02:39:17.200]  numbers I've seen numbers that that that it's exponential women above 30 with
[02:39:17.200 --> 02:39:21.600]  thyroid dysfunction it's a epidemic it's an epidemic the thyroid gland is
[02:39:21.600 --> 02:39:24.520]  connected to your adrenal glands and your adrenal glands are your stress
[02:39:24.520 --> 02:39:27.400]  glands those are the glands that are responsible for that's the gland that's
[02:39:27.400 --> 02:39:30.720]  responsible for having a combat stress the more stress you have more hyper
[02:39:30.720 --> 02:39:35.520]  adrenal hyper adrenal you are the slower your thyroid will function to
[02:39:35.520 --> 02:39:40.160]  compensate for that so what we have is a culture that is so stressed out not
[02:39:40.160 --> 02:39:43.520]  just psychologically and emotionally but also physiologically that we're all
[02:39:43.520 --> 02:39:47.480]  hyper adrenal and our adrenal glands are burning out the thyroid's response to
[02:39:47.480 --> 02:39:51.240]  that is to slow down to compensate the adrenal glands give you this hyped up
[02:39:51.240 --> 02:39:55.960]  caffeine energy the thyroid gland gives you a nice smooth easygoing energy over
[02:39:55.960 --> 02:39:59.680]  time when the adrenal glands are kicking in the thyroid compensates by
[02:39:59.680 --> 02:40:04.600]  slowing down so this hyper adrenalism leads to hypothyroidism and from that
[02:40:04.600 --> 02:40:09.160]  point forward Alex every single disease is possible because the thyroid
[02:40:09.160 --> 02:40:12.920]  regulates every one of the one well here's here's what's going on how long
[02:40:12.920 --> 02:40:15.760]  are you here in town you have to get on an airplane today get an airplane later
[02:40:15.760 --> 02:40:18.800]  today well as soon as the show's over we got to go in there and take this two
[02:40:18.800 --> 02:40:21.680]  part interview and I want you to go through it all with people and with
[02:40:21.680 --> 02:40:26.600]  Aaron and for Aaron to throw in points and Aaron is a private guy I've drug
[02:40:26.600 --> 02:40:29.880]  Aaron in here but Aaron you can be a testament to other people I mean you're
[02:40:29.880 --> 02:40:33.760]  a great example tell folks because I've even listened to this show and I mean out
[02:40:33.760 --> 02:40:37.080]  of the full spectrum of research I know you've told me fuchs is one of your main
[02:40:37.080 --> 02:40:41.080]  sources overall what have you done let's say my wife's listing right now
[02:40:41.080 --> 02:40:44.880]  because she's wanted to implement even more of this I'm wanting to just enough
[02:40:44.880 --> 02:40:48.240]  to you'll hear the show some and research it some but to really dive into this
[02:40:48.240 --> 02:40:53.520]  what have you done Aaron to lose 65 pounds in what six months I mean again I
[02:40:53.520 --> 02:40:58.040]  was working out I just wasn't getting much results it was very hard to kick
[02:40:58.040 --> 02:41:02.120]  the bad foods basically but it finally sunk in after a few months of hearing
[02:41:02.120 --> 02:41:06.040]  this stuff I was already taking the multivitamins the liquid stuff and I
[02:41:06.040 --> 02:41:12.040]  started taking the EFAs but once I took the Omega 3 and 6 EFAs twice daily or
[02:41:12.040 --> 02:41:15.920]  three times daily and then the whey powder twice daily that is when I started
[02:41:15.920 --> 02:41:20.560]  losing weight very rapidly so instead of doing an Adkins diet where you just eat
[02:41:20.560 --> 02:41:24.800]  giant amounts of meat and they're all with all the hormones and chemicals you
[02:41:24.800 --> 02:41:28.800]  just take the essential fatty acids and and the whey powder and now you're not
[02:41:28.800 --> 02:41:32.600]  hungry I could not eat especially in the first two or three months of this I
[02:41:32.600 --> 02:41:37.720]  just I couldn't even hardly eat anything and then yeah and then you just nibble
[02:41:37.720 --> 02:41:44.640]  on on on some vegetables fruits and nuts and stuff let me tell you I'm going
[02:41:44.640 --> 02:41:47.760]  completely on one of the greatest strategies you can employ to stay
[02:41:47.760 --> 02:41:53.480]  younger to lose weight and to prevent disease is to undercalorize to take less
[02:41:53.480 --> 02:41:57.720]  calories than you need because when the body perceives your that is getting less
[02:41:57.720 --> 02:42:03.120]  calories it wants to send you out on a hunt for for zebra and for wildebeest so
[02:42:03.120 --> 02:42:06.360]  it sends the energy to your legs and builds muscle now this is just under
[02:42:06.360 --> 02:42:10.680]  calorie undercalorization slightly and so you want to under eat well no they've
[02:42:10.680 --> 02:42:15.280]  got studies in mice rats insects everything they live longer when exactly
[02:42:15.280 --> 02:42:18.400]  when they bring it down to almost starvation but a high nutrient diet
[02:42:18.400 --> 02:42:23.920]  exactly high nutrients low calories the only way to do that Alex the only way
[02:42:23.920 --> 02:42:27.840]  to do that is to get on a supplement program the reason young Jevity is so
[02:42:27.840 --> 02:42:32.240]  wonderful is because it's so easy to do when you get on a supplement program and
[02:42:32.240 --> 02:42:35.880]  you give your body nutrients without calories every marker of health and
[02:42:35.880 --> 02:42:39.720]  longevity improves it's the number one way to improve health and lung and the
[02:42:39.720 --> 02:42:44.840]  system knows this and and and and and sells us food to make us sick which they
[02:42:44.840 --> 02:42:48.160]  then give us treatments for that's right this is all biochemistry this is not
[02:42:48.160 --> 02:42:52.680]  theory this is how the body works when it perceives low calories it sends you
[02:42:52.680 --> 02:42:56.160]  out on a hunt it makes you sharper in fact there are neurotransmitters in your
[02:42:56.160 --> 02:42:59.640]  brain to keep you alert when you're no no that's what that's the one reason I
[02:42:59.640 --> 02:43:03.960]  before would just try to willpower diet yeah is that I got super smart super
[02:43:03.960 --> 02:43:08.360]  aggressive and super angry I mean I mean when I would go on diets and just not
[02:43:08.360 --> 02:43:13.800]  eat very much I was my brain nutrients without yeah exactly but I was my I had
[02:43:13.800 --> 02:43:17.080]  lots of energy but I was really mean when you're missing key nutrients probably
[02:43:17.080 --> 02:43:19.600]  it's not you don't want to just starve yourself you want to give yourself no
[02:43:19.600 --> 02:43:22.640]  no exactly you're saying high nutrient low calorie high nutrient listen I want
[02:43:22.640 --> 02:43:27.080]  to talk about this right now folks can call if they want to have any questions
[02:43:27.080 --> 02:43:36.560]  or get involved with young Jevity 877-551-1301-877-551-1301 and expanding
[02:43:36.560 --> 02:43:42.480]  on that you can hear Ben over there drinking his his pollen birds there in
[02:43:42.480 --> 02:43:47.640]  the background and you can also go to info wars team.com and part of the
[02:43:47.640 --> 02:43:51.560]  proceeds when you buy the different vitamins and minerals and essential
[02:43:51.560 --> 02:43:56.400]  fatty acids and nutrients that are there goes to fund the info wars media
[02:43:56.400 --> 02:43:59.760]  operation again we're not like revolutionary communists that rob banks
[02:43:59.760 --> 02:44:03.480]  to fund ourselves we promote things we believe in in free market and I've done
[02:44:03.480 --> 02:44:07.600]  deep research because over the years I turned on so many vitamin mineral things
[02:44:07.600 --> 02:44:12.120]  I did research research when I finally got ready to get into it myself boom I
[02:44:12.120 --> 02:44:16.160]  chose young Jevity and it's something you get involved in as a home business or
[02:44:16.160 --> 02:44:22.800]  to sell in your grocery store to sell in areas where you have a connection to the
[02:44:22.800 --> 02:44:27.120]  public or or or your little five and dime or your gas station whatever the
[02:44:27.120 --> 02:44:31.800]  case is people need to get this information and they need to get
[02:44:31.800 --> 02:44:37.080]  involved and again that's info wars team.com there's banners up at info
[02:44:37.080 --> 02:44:42.600]  wars.com you can't forget it info wars team.com there it is on screen or call
[02:44:42.600 --> 02:44:48.680]  877-551-1301 now tell us about pollen burst Aaron do you want a pollen burst
[02:44:48.680 --> 02:44:52.600]  or do you want a tangy tangerine? I'll take the pollen. I like this too but I was
[02:44:52.600 --> 02:44:56.360]  gonna do a pollen burst down here here's a pollen burst tell us Ben what is in
[02:44:56.360 --> 02:45:00.120]  this couple by the way when you got in here I just say quit quit popping your
[02:45:00.120 --> 02:45:03.040]  bottle and drinking and right before we went live you actually started taking a
[02:45:03.040 --> 02:45:05.920]  pollen burst right when you got in here heck yeah the first time I met you out
[02:45:05.920 --> 02:45:09.960]  in California you were visiting MZ's radio stations he's got myself and you
[02:45:09.960 --> 02:45:13.440]  on you you were in there you know you know I'd like to mix the beyond tangy
[02:45:13.440 --> 02:45:16.680]  tangerine with the pollen burst okay well let's hear the pollen versus got the
[02:45:16.680 --> 02:45:22.080]  B vitamins in there and the B vitamins are so fascinating because most people are
[02:45:22.080 --> 02:45:25.200]  going to be deficient in the B vitamins because they're rapidly processed out of
[02:45:25.200 --> 02:45:27.640]  foods so if you're eating foods that are cooked if you're eating foods that
[02:45:27.640 --> 02:45:31.600]  are frozen if you're eating foods that are prepared in any way you're going to
[02:45:31.600 --> 02:45:35.080]  be deficient in these B vitamins and the B vitamins work on the parts of the body
[02:45:35.080 --> 02:45:41.440]  that move the fastest the brain the heart the skin and the digestive system
[02:45:41.440 --> 02:45:45.280]  those are the four systems that that respond rapidly to the B vitamins so
[02:45:45.280 --> 02:45:47.680]  you notice when you start taking the pollen burst you know B vitamins will
[02:45:47.680 --> 02:45:51.040]  help you think and it's great if you if you have a test to take if you're a
[02:45:51.040 --> 02:45:54.200]  student the B vitamins are important for the heart and by the way when it comes to
[02:45:54.200 --> 02:45:58.760]  heart disease we got 600,000 people in this country who die of heart disease
[02:45:58.760 --> 02:46:03.080]  every year some 64 million Americans have some form of heart disease some
[02:46:03.080 --> 02:46:07.840]  form of heart disease one form or another the B vitamins a nickel's worth of
[02:46:07.840 --> 02:46:12.080]  B vitamins every day is the most powerful nutritional way to protect yourself
[02:46:12.080 --> 02:46:15.280]  from heart disease it may be the single most powerful thing you could do to
[02:46:15.280 --> 02:46:18.560]  protect yourself and look heart disease is getting worse all the stuff and if
[02:46:18.560 --> 02:46:23.760]  you look 50 years ago they were eating chicken fried steaks gravy they didn't
[02:46:23.760 --> 02:46:27.240]  have that many heart attacks or cancer if you look at it it's not even the quote
[02:46:27.240 --> 02:46:30.640]  unhealthy food that they've taught us that is the main cause of this it's all
[02:46:30.640 --> 02:46:35.000]  the additives and the petrochemical companies that get authorization to put
[02:46:35.000 --> 02:46:39.640]  poison the food because they know it's addicting tell us about MSG and stuff as
[02:46:39.640 --> 02:46:43.680]  we add drinks. MSG is classified as one of the one
[02:46:43.680 --> 02:46:46.920]  compounds classified as an excitotoxin and what that means that makes your brain
[02:46:46.920 --> 02:46:51.920]  so happy that you'll think that the most rottenest piece of crap tastes like
[02:46:51.920 --> 02:46:56.280]  cherry pie or tastes something like something delicious because it tricks
[02:46:56.280 --> 02:47:00.360]  your brain into being really happy the Japanese were the ones who pioneered
[02:47:00.360 --> 02:47:06.920]  MSG so they could feed their soldiers crappy food they could the soldiers
[02:47:06.920 --> 02:47:10.360]  would eat the crappy food by the way that's on record yeah the soldiers would
[02:47:10.360 --> 02:47:13.160]  eat the crappy food they thought thought they were eating filet mignon but they
[02:47:13.160 --> 02:47:17.800]  were eating the crappiest one by the way in Europe and in Japan and China it's a
[02:47:17.800 --> 02:47:23.320]  gourmet place you've got a book six months out to eat pure soaked MSG
[02:47:23.320 --> 02:47:27.640]  crud same thing with the hot wings by the way now if I eat MSG within hours I
[02:47:27.640 --> 02:47:31.440]  have a horrible headache I've developed a total allergy to it so they know what
[02:47:31.440 --> 02:47:34.800]  they're doing you're playing with brain chemistry the last thing you want to do
[02:47:34.800 --> 02:47:39.840]  is play with your brain chemistry with artificial chemicals well I tell you
[02:47:39.840 --> 02:47:44.440]  expanding on that this should be criminal what they do but but there's
[02:47:44.440 --> 02:47:47.560]  other chemicals they put in the food you know but we're participating Alex we
[02:47:47.560 --> 02:47:51.400]  volunteer nobody forces us to go eat this stuff we're volunteering but the
[02:47:51.400 --> 02:47:54.840]  FDA says we're the government we're keeping you safe right well if you're
[02:47:54.840 --> 02:47:58.520]  gonna trust the FDA you know yeah that's a big point too though I've heard you
[02:47:58.520 --> 02:48:02.560]  read those quotes on air the founding fathers Benjamin Rush Benjamin Rush
[02:48:02.560 --> 02:48:04.880]  warned about this stuff Benjamin Rush signed the Declaration of Independence
[02:48:04.880 --> 02:48:09.160]  he's a medical doctor and he warned about the hegemony and tyranny of modern
[02:48:09.160 --> 02:48:12.120]  medicine what's always which doctors that take over because they know how
[02:48:12.120 --> 02:48:15.160]  humans work throughout society they manipulate Aaron you want some of this
[02:48:15.160 --> 02:48:19.760]  here you want that spoon the biggest statement you can make Alex that the
[02:48:19.760 --> 02:48:24.360]  most powerful statement you can make is to disengage from the machine at every
[02:48:24.360 --> 02:48:29.600]  turn I've got that and I am sold I have barely I've gone 10 degrees towards you
[02:48:29.600 --> 02:48:33.160]  that I've already seen massive results that's awesome I have come ten and
[02:48:33.160 --> 02:48:37.440]  Aaron has turned 180 degrees right pointed straight where Ben Fuchs is and
[02:48:37.440 --> 02:48:41.720]  look at the results exactly so I'm slowly turning myself towards you and if I
[02:48:41.720 --> 02:48:46.000]  just remember to eat the way shake if I just remember to take the tangy
[02:48:46.000 --> 02:48:50.080]  tangerine if I remember to take I mean I when I do eat the essential fatty acids
[02:48:50.080 --> 02:48:54.600]  from young Jevity I'm literally not hungry and my brain works better exactly
[02:48:54.600 --> 02:48:57.960]  what do you recommend people buy as a starter pack at info wars team.com the
[02:48:57.960 --> 02:49:02.480]  ultimate EFA is the osteo FX and the beyond tangy tangerine is in the Alex
[02:49:02.480 --> 02:49:07.000]  pack it's discounted if you buy all three it's a perfect way to demonstrate how
[02:49:07.000 --> 02:49:10.800]  powerful this is not just for the person buying it but for somebody who's
[02:49:10.800 --> 02:49:15.160]  watching the person buying it for a loved one of the who's watching somebody
[02:49:15.160 --> 02:49:19.720]  well that's why young Jevity is literally so successful is because people
[02:49:19.720 --> 02:49:22.760]  literally see the results they see the results just like it just like what's
[02:49:22.760 --> 02:49:27.560]  happened to Aaron and Alex this is not a miracle this is not magic we're supposed
[02:49:27.560 --> 02:49:31.160]  to be Kenyan runners that's what we're supposed to be we're supposed to be lean
[02:49:31.160 --> 02:49:35.600]  and mean from the way ever seen a Kenyan runner that's what human beings are
[02:49:35.600 --> 02:49:39.160]  supposed to be every pound you have that's above a Kenyan runner is something
[02:49:39.160 --> 02:49:43.000]  that's a part of our dysfunctional society it's a life a lifestyle choice
[02:49:43.000 --> 02:49:46.600]  that you made so picture yourself as a Kenyan runner and then picture the
[02:49:46.600 --> 02:49:49.640]  difference between you and it as a Kenyan runner and that difference
[02:49:49.640 --> 02:49:53.120]  represents the lifestyle choices and the dysfunctional culture that we've
[02:49:53.120 --> 02:49:56.960]  immersed ourselves in as you begin to incorporate these strategies you reverse
[02:49:56.960 --> 02:50:00.080]  that and you become closer to a Kenyan runner you know what I mean by a Kenyan
[02:50:00.080 --> 02:50:04.040]  runner lean and mean no things are supposed to be greyhounds is what we're
[02:50:04.040 --> 02:50:08.120]  supposed to be exactly right now now what is it with in domesticated we've been
[02:50:08.120 --> 02:50:11.800]  like a difference between a lion and a pussycat we're the pussycat we've been
[02:50:11.800 --> 02:50:15.400]  domesticated we're supposed to be lions and we get domesticated through the
[02:50:15.400 --> 02:50:19.680]  the foods that we're eating and the ways we participate in our culture so if you
[02:50:19.680 --> 02:50:23.360]  want to get your feralness back if you want to get your vigor back if you want
[02:50:23.360 --> 02:50:28.400]  to get your your zest for life back you have to reverse that process and the way
[02:50:28.400 --> 02:50:32.000]  you do it the first thing you do is nutritional supplementation and calorie
[02:50:32.000 --> 02:50:36.400]  restriction and then working out as well as something to build muscle well
[02:50:36.400 --> 02:50:40.720]  that's the thing is that set of even eating something just go for a run that
[02:50:40.720 --> 02:50:44.680]  burns fat you have a meal right there you get a well here's another thing but a
[02:50:44.680 --> 02:50:49.520]  female hormone is produced in body fat so the more body fat you're carrying the
[02:50:49.520 --> 02:50:53.880]  more feminized you become that means gynecomastia which means breasts that
[02:50:53.880 --> 02:50:59.400]  means impotence and sexual problems that means lower resistance to disease

[02:54:22.560 --> 02:54:29.360]  pretty amazing clip that we played in the second hour if you missed it it's up
[02:54:29.360 --> 02:54:39.600]  at info wars.com the Congress now has come out and made the announcement that
[02:54:39.600 --> 02:54:46.200]  Obama requested the secret arrest and disappearance of citizens of the bill
[02:54:46.200 --> 02:54:50.200]  of course we already knew that from his actions his announcements he said he could
[02:54:50.200 --> 02:54:54.120]  do it himself but you know the fact is that's the new level of deception we're
[02:54:54.120 --> 02:54:58.760]  dealing with here unbelievable tonight's info wars nightly news is going to be
[02:54:58.760 --> 02:55:02.560]  particularly power-packed Aaron Dyches is going to be hosting it and with Ben
[02:55:02.560 --> 02:55:07.200]  Fuchs you don't want to miss that but going back in a few minutes we've got
[02:55:07.200 --> 02:55:10.640]  left we'll do the little five-minute addendum in overdrive this internet
[02:55:10.640 --> 02:55:13.480]  only here in a moment but the official radio show ends here in about five
[02:55:13.480 --> 02:55:17.200]  minutes Aaron I was just talking to you during the break and you said look it's
[02:55:17.200 --> 02:55:24.080]  so easy when you take the longevity minerals and and vitamins because now
[02:55:24.080 --> 02:55:28.400]  your body's got that then you've got protein on top of it from the way you've
[02:55:28.400 --> 02:55:31.280]  got the essential fatty acids you've got everything your body wants you're just
[02:55:31.280 --> 02:55:34.120]  not hungry anymore but you're eating things where the weight's going to pour
[02:55:34.120 --> 02:55:38.360]  off of you in fact how are you gonna stop the weight loss when do you plan to
[02:55:38.360 --> 02:55:45.800]  quit yeah I guess yeah I don't know what's gonna happen then but yeah it was
[02:55:45.800 --> 02:55:50.160]  very easy I mean it makes me want to work out more anyway so I started with
[02:55:50.160 --> 02:55:53.560]  taking the multivitamins just basically to see if it works I did notice the
[02:55:53.560 --> 02:55:57.440]  difference and then I started focusing more on the way in the EFAs with the
[02:55:57.440 --> 02:56:02.640]  multivitamins the weight just poured off and working out was a lot easier anyway
[02:56:02.640 --> 02:56:07.040]  but I wasn't working out nearly even half as hard as I was two years ago a year
[02:56:07.040 --> 02:56:12.080]  ago very moderate really the trick is you don't want to be you don't be forced to
[02:56:12.080 --> 02:56:15.600]  like looking for food all the time you know how people are looking for food all
[02:56:15.600 --> 02:56:19.920]  the time they live to eat they live every minute of the day is spent thinking
[02:56:19.920 --> 02:56:23.400]  about what the next piece of food is is because their body is so starving their
[02:56:23.400 --> 02:56:27.200]  brain is so starving for nutrients that it sends them on this one pointed hunt
[02:56:27.200 --> 02:56:31.960]  for food and instead it's getting empty calories so it's more more more appetite
[02:56:31.960 --> 02:56:35.880]  and appetite and satisfaction are regulated by chemistry what we're
[02:56:35.880 --> 02:56:40.000]  talking about here is nothing less than hacking into the brain's chemistry to
[02:56:40.000 --> 02:56:43.360]  tell the brain that you're full and tell the brain that you're satisfied I
[02:56:43.360 --> 02:56:48.080]  hate willpower I have no willpower I don't believe it should be hard when you
[02:56:48.080 --> 02:56:51.800]  start using nutritional supplements you hack into the brain's satisfaction
[02:56:51.800 --> 02:56:56.160]  centers and the brain sends the message that everything is right you're sad we
[02:56:56.160 --> 02:57:01.200]  could put the New World Order out of business in a revolution if we just all
[02:57:01.200 --> 02:57:04.520]  of us to the transformation you guys have gone through if I can do it and we
[02:57:04.520 --> 02:57:08.640]  can air this tape you know six months from now and I'm 180 pounds right and
[02:57:08.640 --> 02:57:12.440]  show people and say by the way the system knows this and none of them will
[02:57:12.440 --> 02:57:15.840]  tell you because they want the racket to continue forever if you weren't
[02:57:15.840 --> 02:57:19.600]  spending all your energy and your time and your money looking for food what
[02:57:19.600 --> 02:57:22.600]  kind of energy and time and money would you have to do other things hey what do
[02:57:22.600 --> 02:57:25.880]  you do with me to California yeah I remember I have that memory of him
[02:57:25.880 --> 02:57:28.320]  telling you how you could lose weight that's right and that was that was a
[02:57:28.320 --> 02:57:31.080]  year ago and I thought they were real weird because we went out to eat and
[02:57:31.080 --> 02:57:34.480]  they didn't eat anything and they were sitting there and I didn't know what
[02:57:34.480 --> 02:57:37.520]  the vitamins yet I mean I heard about them but hadn't tried them yet no I was
[02:57:37.520 --> 02:57:40.120]  like then they're like space aliens they all look really healthy but they
[02:57:40.120 --> 02:57:47.240]  don't eat we're like yeah yeah I'm telling you Aaron yeah that was in that
[02:57:47.240 --> 02:57:50.360]  was in Santa Cruz yeah I heard about it then and then a few months later when
[02:57:50.360 --> 02:57:54.120]  you start promoting I said I'm gonna try this but once I put my money I wanted
[02:57:54.120 --> 02:57:58.200]  to make sure I was taking them and see if there's results or not and well living
[02:57:58.200 --> 02:58:02.000]  testimony it's folks camera puts 10 pounds on you if you saw Aaron in person
[02:58:02.000 --> 02:58:06.400]  it is unbelievable hey 11 pounds in two and a half weeks with me and that's
[02:58:06.400 --> 02:58:10.080]  just gonna keep going it's gonna keep no no I haven't even put it all into
[02:58:10.080 --> 02:58:16.520]  function yet I'm gonna start banging nothing but the way and tangy tangerine
[02:58:16.520 --> 02:58:19.720]  take a picture now take a picture before you lose any more weight take a
[02:58:19.720 --> 02:58:23.000]  picture now without your shirt take a picture without your shirt now I don't
[02:58:23.000 --> 02:58:27.040]  know about right now without your shirt but take a picture of yourself I know

[03:01:58.520 --> 03:02:03.160]  awesome well you're getting close to it and again you're gonna have an extended
[03:02:03.160 --> 03:02:06.280]  interview tonight I just want to tell people the number they want to give
[03:02:06.280 --> 03:02:11.000]  young Jevvie a call and join the infowars team or ask any questions 877
[03:02:11.000 --> 03:02:18.240]  551 1301 and you can also go to infowars team calm Ben and Aaron in
[03:02:18.240 --> 03:02:21.480]  closing any other points you guys would like to make yeah I want to make this
[03:02:21.480 --> 03:02:26.680]  point you owe it to yourself to try this to just give it a try if you're like
[03:02:26.680 --> 03:02:29.640]  most people you're gonna notice a difference in less than two weeks you're
[03:02:29.640 --> 03:02:32.800]  like most people you're gonna notice a difference almost right away and you owe
[03:02:32.800 --> 03:02:35.960]  it to yourself to at least try the beyond tangy tangerine ideally get
[03:02:35.960 --> 03:02:39.200]  yourself on the healthy start pack it's a hundred bucks for the healthy start
[03:02:39.200 --> 03:02:42.520]  pack I think 110 bucks for the healthy start pack around 40 or 50 bucks for the
[03:02:42.520 --> 03:02:48.280]  beyond tangy tangerine it's like a dollar 10 a day a dollar 15 a day you cannot
[03:02:48.280 --> 03:02:51.960]  afford to not do this and when you start to see the difference we start to see
[03:02:51.960 --> 03:02:54.640]  the weight drop off when you start to see your blood pressure drop when you
[03:02:54.640 --> 03:02:57.640]  start to see your blood sugar markers drop and we start to see your skin
[03:02:57.640 --> 03:03:01.480]  improved you're gonna be hooked just like I am and just like you guys are now
[03:03:01.480 --> 03:03:06.160]  when you talk to your fellow pharmacist who know all this biochemistry they know
[03:03:06.160 --> 03:03:09.280]  this stuff I love talking to pharmacists I love talking to medical people
[03:03:09.280 --> 03:03:13.160]  because the medical people believe it or not that rank and file medical people
[03:03:13.160 --> 03:03:17.000]  they understand this stuff it's not the doctors per se as much as it's the
[03:03:17.000 --> 03:03:21.320]  medical model it's the paradigm that's not and they know that the models waking
[03:03:21.320 --> 03:03:24.480]  up so now they're coming with government control where a computer tells them
[03:03:24.480 --> 03:03:27.520]  everything they've got to do that's right and vitamin control too you know if
[03:03:27.520 --> 03:03:31.080]  we don't watch out we're not gonna have the right to do these things this is
[03:03:31.080 --> 03:03:35.360]  this is a bit right now we have the right to do our nutritional supplements
[03:03:35.360 --> 03:03:38.880]  but it's not only a matter of time well they're making them like a drug they're
[03:03:38.880 --> 03:03:41.760]  making them like a drug and they're limiting the amount of amount that you
[03:03:41.760 --> 03:03:45.480]  could take why are they so scared Europe's already done it what's why are
[03:03:45.480 --> 03:03:49.000]  they so scared dr. Deena Dell says that you should outlaw it basically and I've
[03:03:49.000 --> 03:03:52.680]  heard him say if you don't take shots you should be arrested but I thought if
[03:03:52.680 --> 03:03:56.160]  they take the shots they're protected why can't oh because it's not protecting
[03:03:56.160 --> 03:04:00.400]  them now they have to admit vaccines are giving people the illness why was the
[03:04:00.400 --> 03:04:04.560]  FDA so terrified of vitamins why is the the medical paradigm so why do they
[03:04:04.560 --> 03:04:08.200]  feel they need to control the amount of nutrients that we put into our body what
[03:04:08.200 --> 03:04:11.280]  could that be a lie and say that study show vitamins and minerals aren't good
[03:04:11.280 --> 03:04:15.320]  for you we that's like saying study show oxygen isn't good for you exactly but
[03:04:15.320 --> 03:04:18.520]  you by definition of vitamin is a substance that if you don't have it you
[03:04:18.520 --> 03:04:23.040]  suffer a disease that's the definition of a vitamin like scurvy exactly or
[03:04:23.040 --> 03:04:26.880]  berry berry if you don't have the definition of a vitamin is a substance
[03:04:26.880 --> 03:04:30.040]  that if you don't have you get it what's the one with iodine with the big
[03:04:30.040 --> 03:04:34.080]  goiter yeah iodine is another is another fact Richard Reeves had some
[03:04:34.080 --> 03:04:38.160]  questions left to ask those tonight I'll switch to the issue of minerals on the
