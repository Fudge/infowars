[00:00.000 --> 00:05.000]  Thank you for listening to GCN. Visit GCNlive.com today.
[00:11.680 --> 00:13.360]  Big brother,
[00:13.360 --> 00:15.080]  mainstream media,
[00:15.080 --> 00:17.560]  government cover-ups. You want answers?
[00:18.080 --> 00:26.280]  Well, so does he. He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network. And now, live from Austin, Texas,
[00:26.280 --> 00:29.280]  Alex Jones.
[00:38.680 --> 00:48.640]  Ladies and gentlemen, it is Wednesday, the 24th day of April 2013. I am your host, Alex Jones,
[00:48.640 --> 00:53.560]  and we are going to attempt to cover all of this vital and important breaking news today here in
[00:53.560 --> 00:59.320]  the next three hours. Lindsey Williams hadn't been on in about six months, and he said two years ago
[00:59.320 --> 01:04.120]  that the real crisis would flare up in Asia before they moved the fleet. I wanted to get an update
[01:04.120 --> 01:09.280]  from him on what's happening in the world. He'll be on in the third hour. I know that is exciting
[01:09.280 --> 01:14.680]  for some and horrifying for others, but Lindsey's always interesting and informative, and he'll be
[01:14.680 --> 01:21.760]  joining us. Also, Dan Budandi, m4wars.com, East Coast reporter, privately and now publicly known
[01:21.760 --> 01:29.520]  as the Kraken. I said Monday, John Brown walks up and says, do we release the Kraken? That's our
[01:29.520 --> 01:33.920]  nickname for him. And I said, yes, release the Kraken. That was at like 3 o'clock, right after
[01:33.920 --> 01:41.280]  the bombing happened, because he's in Rhode Island, right outside Boston. So that is very
[01:41.280 --> 01:47.680]  interesting. And look right here. If you're a TV viewer, Adan Salazar is doing an article on this
[01:47.680 --> 01:54.320]  right now for m4wars.com. We all saw this on the high def television. We all saw this on the high
[01:54.320 --> 01:59.280]  def television, and these are screenshots off that. We're gonna grab the actual video that two
[01:59.280 --> 02:04.240]  bald headed men came over during the last press conference and got in his face and told him that
[02:04.240 --> 02:09.760]  he better watch it and other things that were threatening. And Budandi said, I know the
[02:09.760 --> 02:14.000]  government's a bunch of murderers and you'll be brought to justice. I'm not afraid of you and
[02:14.000 --> 02:17.680]  pointed his finger back at him. Plus, they didn't know what to do. He had a bald head as well.
[02:17.680 --> 02:22.640]  It's like, you've got bald heads? I've got a big bald head. In fact, it's three times the size of
[02:22.640 --> 02:29.120]  teleservoluses. And what are you gonna do? There's few people have bigger heads than even me.
[02:29.120 --> 02:34.560]  And Dan Budandi is definitely, no, I mean that lovingly. I mean, I got a big head too.
[02:35.520 --> 02:41.120]  But Budandi, it kind of freaked out the Secret Service cuz his head was bigger than theirs.
[02:41.120 --> 02:44.800]  And I mean, they bugged their eyes out, they got in his face, but here's the deal.
[02:45.680 --> 02:54.080]  Viewers pointed out that this is Obama's personal top Secret Service guys always seen with him.
[02:54.080 --> 03:01.440]  And sure enough, we have these Secret Service guys with Obama, document can please. We have them with
[03:01.440 --> 03:12.960]  Obama, and it's definitely the same guy. Absolutely, chrome dome and all right there. So this Obama
[03:12.960 --> 03:20.000]  sent the Secret Service to try to stop Dan Budandi, and of course, it failed.
[03:21.360 --> 03:26.000]  It of course completely and totally failed because Dan Budandi's bald head is bigger than theirs.
[03:26.000 --> 03:31.760]  Again, that's what it comes, look at the size of the head, it's got its own weather systems.
[03:33.760 --> 03:38.720]  All right, I'm sorry. I promise to be in a good mood today cuz I was basically in a controlled
[03:38.720 --> 03:47.360]  rage all yesterday. That is not an act, by the way. And I have decided to be more friendly,
[03:48.160 --> 03:51.760]  and I've decided to be nicer, and I've decided to be nice.
[03:51.760 --> 03:55.760]  By the way, Jakari Jackson is in the control room right now, he ran over here. Are you jealous that
[03:55.760 --> 04:01.200]  Dan Budandi has a bigger bald head than you, Jakari? Put him on air. Are you a little bit
[04:01.200 --> 04:05.600]  jealous right now? I'm not jealous that Dan Budandi has a, actually, I think my head is
[04:05.600 --> 04:12.960]  bigger than Dan's. Packed, that's ridiculous, preposterous. His is more bald cuz Dan shaves
[04:12.960 --> 04:18.000]  with razors, I shave with clippers. You know what, I bet next time he's in town, we will have
[04:18.000 --> 04:23.520]  a contest on air. We will make $500 prize, we will measure circumferences of the cranium.
[04:23.520 --> 04:26.640]  If you wanna give a $500 prize with the biggest head?
[04:26.640 --> 04:30.320]  Yes. Let's just do this right now, who has the biggest head?
[04:30.320 --> 04:38.400]  No, no, you and Budandi. My head's bigger than yours, buddy. What are you talking,
[04:38.400 --> 04:42.880]  I got a bigger pumpkin than you. Yeah, yeah. All right, Jakari.
[04:42.880 --> 04:48.800]  That's not why I came over here, I had some other business.
[04:48.800 --> 04:50.560]  You're a little bit jealous right now, look, it's all right.
[04:50.560 --> 04:54.000]  Okay. It's all right, okay? All right, I understand.
[04:54.000 --> 04:57.760]  All right, by the way, the AP and others are trying to imply that I'm basically involved
[04:57.760 --> 05:03.280]  with the bombers now. Well, so we're gonna cover it all, they had to blame the Tea Party
[05:03.280 --> 05:09.600]  one way or the other. Pull the right back. A little over a year ago, I began to do a
[05:09.600 --> 05:14.400]  lot of research into why, even if I had a pretty good sized meal, that I was still starving.
[05:14.400 --> 05:19.440]  And my research led me to a well-known fact that most of the soils that we grow our crops
[05:19.440 --> 05:23.600]  on here in the United States and across the industrialized world are almost completely
[05:23.600 --> 05:29.200]  depleted of almost all of the key minerals and trace elements that our bodies need to
[05:29.200 --> 05:34.320]  rebuild themselves, fight off cancer and be healthy. I then searched out the best
[05:34.320 --> 05:39.840]  vitamin and mineral company out there and discovered Young Jevity. The Young Jevity products
[05:39.840 --> 05:44.400]  are designed to give you the real nutrition you need. And once you've got that, you don't
[05:44.400 --> 05:50.960]  have to eat as much to be satisfied. I've lost 37 pounds in two months, simply getting
[05:50.960 --> 05:56.080]  the vitamins and minerals I need. Check it out for yourself. It's incredible. Go to info wars

[07:30.160 --> 07:35.280]  nationwide. This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established
[07:35.280 --> 07:40.000]  an all-powerful shadow state. Police state 4 chronicles the sickening depths to which our

[08:16.880 --> 08:27.200]  radio network.
[08:31.360 --> 08:41.920]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, it is Wednesday, the 24th day. Wednesday, the 24th day of April
[08:41.920 --> 08:49.360]  2013. I am your host, Alex Jones, and we are going to be live here, Lord willing,
[08:50.080 --> 08:58.320]  for the next three hours. Okay, folks, where to start here? A lot of developments in the whole
[08:58.320 --> 09:07.840]  Boston bombing situation, pointing towards more government involvement at multifaceted
[09:07.840 --> 09:14.240]  levels, as I was just saying. We also have big economic developments. We have big developments
[09:14.240 --> 09:17.920]  in the Ryerson case. I'm on record saying they'd probably go through two or three
[09:18.560 --> 09:23.760]  different patsies. That's what they tend to do whenever they've actually launched the anthrax
[09:23.760 --> 09:29.920]  or Ryerson attack themselves. And with Ryerson case crumbling, FBI targets new man.
[09:30.720 --> 09:34.000]  And then maybe the third or fourth patsy will be killed in police custody
[09:34.000 --> 09:40.240]  after confessing, of course, if they follow the standard stuff that they tend to do.
[09:40.800 --> 09:45.520]  And again, I predicted there'd be some type of bio attack on the day of the bombing,
[09:45.520 --> 09:50.560]  not this Monday, but last Monday, what, nine days ago. If indeed it was a staged event,
[09:50.560 --> 09:57.440]  I said we would see that. We had on the show that day, actor and writer and researcher
[09:57.440 --> 10:05.040]  on the broadcast. And I was talking to the author, Richard Belzer, about the fact that
[10:05.040 --> 10:11.440]  if there's a drill at the same time of a bombing, and if they run a bio attack now against Congress,
[10:12.320 --> 10:17.920]  and if they have got a bunch of legislation they try to ram through, which they've now done,
[10:19.360 --> 10:22.400]  that puts it into the quadrant of a staged event.
[10:22.400 --> 10:29.280]  Plus, almost every event has been at least provocateur'd, and that's on record.
[10:29.280 --> 10:32.400]  They just hope that they call that a conspiracy theory and you don't read
[10:33.600 --> 10:36.240]  the New York Times admitting it or the Washington Post,
[10:37.280 --> 10:41.920]  where they've come out and admitted that the FBI foils its own terror plots, but usually
[10:41.920 --> 10:46.400]  stops them before they go through. In the case of the World Trade Center bombing in 1993,
[10:46.400 --> 10:53.360]  it's on record. AP, New York Times, federal courts, why they had to admit it,
[10:53.920 --> 10:57.200]  because their own intelligence officer, Ahmad Salam, said you're setting us up.
[10:57.200 --> 11:00.720]  You're a real bomb, real detonators. Now you're gonna let the bombing go forward?
[11:00.720 --> 11:05.200]  I'm not gonna be part of killing people. And they said, well, you're gonna go to jail then.
[11:05.200 --> 11:09.760]  So then he freaked out and clandestinely recorded them days before the bombing and
[11:09.760 --> 11:14.000]  after the bombing. And then he did a press conference and announced it and that's why
[11:14.000 --> 11:19.760]  he got paid off 1.4 million to go back to Egypt and shut up instead of being given cement shoes.
[11:21.760 --> 11:24.720]  And remember that Saudi Arabian that was missing that fit one of the
[11:24.720 --> 11:28.080]  descriptions of the people there at the scene? He's been found in the river,
[11:29.520 --> 11:33.360]  which I again said, I think you'll start finding some of these people in the river.
[11:35.200 --> 11:40.080]  The question is, was he in the river beforehand? There was a local
[11:40.080 --> 11:46.240]  Muslim leader saying the government was involved in provocateering terror in Austin.
[11:46.240 --> 11:51.120]  And he bound his arms and legs, slit his wrist and his guts open. He'd clearly been tortured
[11:51.120 --> 11:59.040]  and threw himself off the Congress bridge. And the police immediately said it was a suicide.
[11:59.040 --> 12:04.240]  I wonder if they would have tied up Breitbart and then slit his wrist and tortured him and then
[12:04.240 --> 12:09.600]  thrown him in a river. Maybe put him in a steel cage. Well, he put himself in a cage and had a
[12:09.600 --> 12:16.560]  crane lower him into the river like Houdini, but he didn't get out. So we know there was a drill,
[12:16.560 --> 12:20.880]  they've been caught doing that and they're desperately covering up and now we have this.
[12:20.880 --> 12:27.120]  Senator Chambliss, this is WSBTV and you would never hear about this if it wasn't
[12:27.120 --> 12:33.360]  up on drudgereport.com. You just would never see this local news. Law enforcement agency
[12:33.360 --> 12:40.000]  may have had info about Boston bombing in advance. And that's why they hate infowars.com and
[12:40.000 --> 12:44.800]  worldnetdaily.com and drudgereport.com and a few other real independent sites is because we'll just
[12:44.800 --> 12:49.600]  point at a local news story that was meant to be compartmentalized and never picked up nationally.
[12:50.320 --> 12:54.240]  We'll go, hey, they went all over Boston and aimed guns at people and made them come out of their
[12:54.240 --> 13:01.280]  houses and rough people up. This is unprecedented. You're supposed to only see it live on TV with
[13:01.280 --> 13:07.120]  them saying this is a great idea. Not to hear people either just present it raw or say,
[13:07.120 --> 13:13.040]  is this a good idea? You're told it is a good idea. So see, they don't have a monopoly.
[13:13.040 --> 13:16.640]  That's what the White House said two weeks ago. They don't like Drudge Report. They don't like
[13:17.600 --> 13:22.640]  what Drudge Report links to media matters run by the White House pulling its hair out on a daily
[13:22.640 --> 13:29.600]  basis now. Saying how dare drudgereport.com link to infowars.com. That is the White House
[13:29.600 --> 13:34.080]  pulling their hair out angry. And by the way, we have proof, ladies and gentlemen,
[13:35.280 --> 13:40.560]  that the White House may copy Rush Limbaugh here. I always liked that even as a teenager,
[13:40.560 --> 13:44.000]  I love that. I always wanted to, the reason I wanted to get a talk radio so I could go.
[13:45.120 --> 13:49.840]  But I'm serious. Here I am, ladies. Well, I always liked that because it's that thing.
[13:49.840 --> 13:59.360]  I get a little bit more. See, I can't actually do it first. I'll just do it more than one block.
[13:59.360 --> 14:03.840]  There you go. Is that impressive? I could be like an Olympic paper shaker, just like.
[14:06.400 --> 14:12.480]  Okay. Well, they got rid of stuff like wrestling that's originally in the
[14:12.480 --> 14:20.800]  Greek Roman wrestling. The first thing they did at the Olympic Games. So yeah, synchronized
[14:20.800 --> 14:28.480]  swimming and curling. So we can bring back in paper popping, paper crinkling. Look at that.
[14:29.200 --> 14:35.680]  That's what made him world famous. Seven time gold winner, Alex Jones, unseating the former
[14:35.680 --> 14:41.280]  champion wrestling bar. Here he is going for a record paper crinkle. Ladies and gentlemen,
[14:41.280 --> 14:46.560]  the judges, the judges are stopped. No one has ever seen anything like this. No one. Look at
[14:46.560 --> 14:51.120]  that. Look at the style, the grace, the different angulations, everything he's doing. No one has
[14:51.120 --> 14:56.720]  ever had skills of this level. No one. Oh my God. Oh, wait, wait. He's stopping now. The judges.
[14:56.720 --> 15:04.080]  10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10. It's unanimous. Alex Jones for his eighth and world record gold
[15:04.080 --> 15:10.880]  medal paper crinkling. All right. I've decided to be in a good mood today. Ladies and gentlemen,
[15:10.880 --> 15:14.480]  Adan Salazar is doing an article on this right now. It'll be out in the next hour.
[15:14.480 --> 15:18.480]  Let me just recap the evidence before I get to this. We know there's a drill. They got caught
[15:18.480 --> 15:22.160]  lying about that. Now senators come out and said, cuz he has access to the intelligence.
[15:22.160 --> 15:27.120]  Oh, it looks like they knew and did nothing. Yeah, it came out at the time they had been
[15:27.120 --> 15:31.200]  loud and targeted at least five times and refused to let drones killing.
[15:32.320 --> 15:35.920]  Okay, and I've interviewed the people that were running one of the major operations,
[15:35.920 --> 15:42.160]  Stratus Ivy. And of course, that's Lieutenant Colonel Schaefer. We need to get him back on.
[15:44.160 --> 15:48.000]  That's on record. And it's the same thing. And again, a false flag does not mean that
[15:48.000 --> 15:52.320]  people can't be involved, that there can't be Muslim extremists. The point is, most of the
[15:52.320 --> 15:57.200]  time, that's what it is. You find people, you wind them up, and then you provocateur them and
[15:57.200 --> 16:02.960]  basically command them as the imam, who's really an FBI asset, to carry this out.
[16:02.960 --> 16:07.280]  And then, we're gonna meet you and fly out of the country, it's gonna be great.
[16:07.280 --> 16:11.840]  Or they're part of a drill and you set them up, we don't know. And now they've got a guy who
[16:11.840 --> 16:16.720]  got out of the boat, didn't look like he was bleeding. There was some blood on the boat
[16:16.720 --> 16:23.600]  where he reportedly climbed in. And then five minutes later, he's been shot in the neck
[16:24.560 --> 16:27.360]  and bleeding everywhere, and they have to do a tracheotomy basically on it.
[16:27.360 --> 16:33.760]  And then now, even though he can't talk, he reportedly admits he did it. Well, you gotta
[16:33.760 --> 16:39.440]  love how that kind of justice works. No judge, no jury, no nothing. He's in there in a hospital,
[16:39.440 --> 16:43.120]  God only knows what's going on. None of the story matches, none of it fits.
[16:45.760 --> 16:51.120]  But none of it matches, none of it fits.
[16:51.120 --> 16:57.280]  It's got all the classic telltale signs of a staged event. And they're power grabbing
[16:57.280 --> 17:01.600]  with all this legislation and police state, and now saying you're gonna have to all have
[17:01.600 --> 17:08.000]  anti-terror insurance. The insurance companies run this country. Gotta have government health
[17:08.000 --> 17:13.440]  insurance, gotta have a bit of terrorism insurance. I mean, this is indigenous servitude,
[17:13.440 --> 17:17.760]  this is slavery. This is the takeover of society.
[17:17.760 --> 17:21.440]  You've got all this and now you've got the senator coming out saying, well, he saw the intelligence
[17:21.440 --> 17:27.760]  that agencies knew about this and did not warn people or stop it. Really? WSB TV, we have that
[17:27.760 --> 17:37.600]  video report coming up. So you've got all this going on. And then you've got these photos here
[17:37.600 --> 17:42.640]  off the high def video screen of your TV watcher at info wars.com. Listen, you can see this right
[17:42.640 --> 17:49.120]  now. And I remember seeing the bald headed guys come over to him, Dan Badandi in the press
[17:49.120 --> 17:54.640]  conference. He thought they were Secret Service or FBI, that's what he said on air.
[17:54.640 --> 17:58.240]  We had him on that day when he took over the three press conferences. By taking it over,
[17:58.240 --> 18:03.440]  just bringing up real questions. Why was there a drill? Why are you covering up the drill? And
[18:05.280 --> 18:08.720]  is this a false flag? I mean, governments have been caught false flagging over and over again.
[18:08.720 --> 18:13.520]  You've got to ask that. They are is now confirmed. It's the same guy. We've even got photos of him
[18:13.520 --> 18:21.280]  with the president in the same tie. It was the Secret Service of the president who's trying to
[18:21.280 --> 18:26.320]  get law enforcement authority across the country. Outside their jurisdiction of counterfeiting and
[18:27.040 --> 18:35.360]  protecting puss ball, I mean, POTUS, poop ball, Puss Tupulate or whatever the name is.
[18:35.360 --> 18:41.040]  I'm trying to remember the proper name. It's POTUS, that's right. But here it is,
[18:41.040 --> 18:45.440]  ladies and gentlemen. Here it is, ladies and gentlemen. There he is right there.
[18:46.960 --> 18:55.120]  And bugging his eyes out of Badandi, who's right there. And this other Secret Service agent.
[18:55.120 --> 18:59.520]  And they basically were threatening. I mean, look at this look, just the craven.
[18:59.520 --> 19:04.000]  You're not gonna ask questions. That is so much evidence of a cover up. And Badandi said,
[19:04.000 --> 19:08.240]  you don't scare me. This government's criminal. We know you did it. That's what he reportedly
[19:08.240 --> 19:13.840]  said to him. And look, the look of craven powers, he's not scaring Badandi, goes out of his face
[19:13.840 --> 19:22.320]  real fast. And there he is with POTUS, POTUS. There he is with POTUS.
[19:24.160 --> 19:25.360]  What does POTUS stand for?
[19:25.360 --> 19:40.800]  Puss Orb. How do you spell out POTUS? It doesn't matter, we'll figure. P-O-O-O-T-S.
[19:42.160 --> 19:52.880]  Anyways, phony occupying office of presidency. Okay, of the United States, there you go. Here,
[19:52.880 --> 19:57.840]  go back to this. There is POTUS with the Secret Service guy, again,
[19:57.840 --> 20:02.320]  acting all powerful and manly. Because that's what it's all about, acting manly all the time,
[20:02.320 --> 20:32.240]  acting powerful. And there's Michelle right there leading everyone.

[21:40.000 --> 21:44.800]  investment advisors won't talk about gold IRAs? They've been available since 1986, yet the
[21:44.800 --> 21:49.440]  financial industry won't recognize the value of gold for your retirement. Gold has outperformed
[21:49.440 --> 21:54.160]  paper investments, yet no word about IRAs. If you would like to have gold for your retirement,
[21:54.160 --> 22:02.640]  call 800-686-2237. Don't get left behind by rising inflation and low returns. Call 800-686-2237.
[22:02.640 --> 22:09.360]  Secure your future and call 1-800-686-2237. In the last two years alone, the U.S. has seen
[22:09.360 --> 22:14.560]  huge losses to our food supply. In 2011, storms and floods raged across the U.S.,
[22:14.560 --> 22:19.440]  costing us $20 billion in lost crops alone. In 2012, we saw the largest drought in the country
[22:19.440 --> 22:23.920]  in more than 50 years. You may think out of sight, out of mind. And so you don't think you
[22:23.920 --> 22:29.760]  will be affected. The fact is, you are. We all are. Food shortages drive prices up for everyone.
[22:29.760 --> 22:34.640]  You might not be able to control Mother Nature, but you can control your food prices by freezing
[22:34.640 --> 22:39.600]  the cost and availability of your food supply with e Foods Direct. Be prepared before you need it

[23:06.480 --> 23:11.600]  It's time for a home security quiz. What effective home security device is smaller
[23:11.600 --> 23:16.480]  than a coffee cup fakes out burglars into thinking someone is home at your house while you're away,
[23:16.480 --> 23:22.320]  plugs into any wall outlet, is recommended by many police departments, and sells for less than $30?
[23:23.040 --> 23:29.040]  Yes, it's fake TV. This year, about one in every 50 U.S. homes will have a break-in with burglars
[23:29.040 --> 23:35.040]  usually picking the easy target, a dark house that looks like no one is home. Fake TV is a small
[23:35.040 --> 23:40.160]  electronic security device that makes it look like someone is home watching TV by simulating
[23:40.160 --> 23:46.080]  the light from a real TV. Fake TV could be the difference between coming home to a secure house
[23:46.080 --> 23:51.920]  or one that's been ransacked. To get your fake TV for only $29.95 with free shipping,
[23:51.920 --> 24:03.360]  go to faketv.com or call 1-877-5FAKETV. That's 877-532-5388. Or go to faketv.com.
[24:03.360 --> 24:05.680]  Fake TV, the burglar deterrent.
[24:11.440 --> 24:14.240]  All right, folks, Alex Jones here back live. Thank you for joining us.
[24:14.240 --> 24:17.840]  You know, I tend to, when things get really stressful,
[24:19.200 --> 24:22.960]  go into kind of an automatic defense mechanism of making it all a big joke.
[24:23.520 --> 24:29.520]  I think that's a natural thing that people do, kind of a gallows humor. It actually freaks me
[24:29.520 --> 24:33.280]  out really bad that in America, and we're gonna get Damodani back on the bottom of the next hour.
[24:33.280 --> 24:39.040]  He talked about it last week on Wednesday and Thursday and Friday when he took over
[24:39.040 --> 24:45.760]  the three press conferences with real questions. And the rest of the compliant lapdog media
[24:45.760 --> 24:48.480]  just didn't look into the drill that's on record happening.
[24:48.480 --> 24:53.520]  Didn't look into prior knowledge, didn't look into stand down, now being confirmed. Didn't look into
[24:53.520 --> 24:58.080]  these guys having multiple aliases and allowed to travel to areas where the West is funding
[24:58.080 --> 25:03.200]  terrorists. They reportedly were radicalized by people on State Department CIA payroll.
[25:03.200 --> 25:09.520]  Just like Al-Qaeda runs Libya and Syria, the takeover. We've now got to give our rights up
[25:09.520 --> 25:16.640]  and get terrorism insurance they're calling for today. That's in CBS News. CNBC is also covering
[25:16.640 --> 25:23.040]  it. We've got to do all this because more people on government welfare, government assistance,
[25:23.040 --> 25:28.000]  government protected, it's all coming out. Just like the shooter at the Aurora situation,
[25:28.000 --> 25:35.280]  always has government ties just all around them. Turned out the Unabomber was CIA,
[25:35.280 --> 25:40.800]  was in MK Ultra, LA Times, federal court documents, came out in his defense.
[25:43.360 --> 25:46.160]  I mean, can there just be one bomber who isn't CIA?
[25:47.440 --> 25:55.360]  But see, I am cursed with being informed. It is, because I have to sit here and be attacked.
[25:55.360 --> 26:00.480]  But I haven't even gotten to this yet. I mean, most talk show hosts would open their show with
[26:00.480 --> 26:04.800]  it. And it's just so bizarre, I don't know what to say. Now that I had time to think about it,
[26:04.800 --> 26:09.760]  because BuzzFeed's always calling here and emailing and asking and asking.
[26:09.760 --> 26:15.840]  And so I said, okay, I'll talk to them. And they took out of context what I said.
[26:17.600 --> 26:22.080]  Because they call up and they go, the Associated Press is reporting that he was in Infowars,
[26:22.080 --> 26:28.160]  an Alex Jones listener. And I said, okay, and I pulled up AP, and I said, okay, I'll talk to them.
[26:28.160 --> 26:32.880]  Cuz I wanted to get a statement out. And I said, look, there is a slight chance they could have
[26:32.880 --> 26:37.200]  been listeners, because so many people are listeners. And instead, they edited it to sound
[26:37.200 --> 26:42.560]  like I'm an egomaniac, or everybody's a listener. I was simply saying, okay, there is a chance,
[26:42.560 --> 26:45.520]  I can't say there isn't a chance, cuz we do have a wide listenership.
[26:45.520 --> 26:49.440]  And plus the aunt's a listener, and she says some of the other family is. But I said,
[26:49.440 --> 26:53.760]  the fact that this guy you're just talking to over in Dagestan and others are saying,
[26:53.760 --> 26:58.080]  Alex Jones. I said, I've seen this time and time again when it turns out to not be true.
[27:00.240 --> 27:04.640]  And I mean, they got some of the quotes in there. The best article put out was by BuzzFeed.
[27:04.640 --> 27:11.200]  Others totally clipped it, where it was like, bombers influenced by Alex Jones.
[27:11.200 --> 27:16.480]  They did it for Alex Jones. There's gotta be 50 articles out. I don't even have time to look
[27:16.480 --> 27:22.240]  at them all. I mean, look at some of these headlines here. Gawker, accused marathon
[27:22.240 --> 27:27.040]  bomber influenced by Infowars. Bomber influenced by Infowars by Alex Jones.
[27:28.240 --> 27:34.400]  Here's another one. Tammerlin believed in basically every conspiracy theory by Alex Jones.
[27:34.400 --> 27:40.080]  The AP headline is bomb suspect influenced by mysterious radical. And then Infowars is in here.
[27:40.080 --> 27:44.720]  It's like, who's the radical? Matt Drudge tweets kind words for Alex Jones,
[27:44.720 --> 27:49.040]  one hell of a broadcast in such homogenized media. And then they try to go, look, he's supporting the
[27:49.040 --> 27:54.160]  guy that supports the terrorist. I mean, it's just no end to it, ladies and gentlemen.
[27:54.160 --> 28:00.800]  And I told you, and you all saw it, every show on CNN, MSNBC, CNBC, you name it,
[28:01.840 --> 28:05.200]  it's gonna be a white guy. It's gonna be a tea party or it's gonna be a gun owner.
[28:05.200 --> 28:09.680]  And they said, ladies and gentlemen, an arrest has been made. Axelrod, who said big news tomorrow,
[28:09.680 --> 28:17.920]  White House, they're planting the media, they're surrogate. They're sheep-dipped minions out of the
[28:17.920 --> 28:21.440]  White House directly into the so-called media. I mean, half the pundits now on CNN or former
[28:21.440 --> 28:27.360]  White House, same thing on MSNBC or maybe more than half. And what do they come out and say?
[28:27.360 --> 28:34.000]  Oh, they made the arrest, you right-wingers are gonna get it. Oh, you get it. You did it.
[28:34.000 --> 28:41.200]  And oh, right-wingers are probably mailing riots to pro-gun people. Yeah, right, and then,
[28:41.200 --> 28:45.200]  oh, the White House has got something suspicious as well, to act like they didn't do it,
[28:45.200 --> 28:52.240]  to act like they weren't involved. Yeah, there it is, Alex Jones, Infowars founder,
[28:52.240 --> 28:56.320]  comments on Boston bomber visiting his website. So that's the new guilt.
[28:57.680 --> 29:01.280]  Maybe go look at their hard drive. They were visited Huffington Post. Well, it's their fault.
[29:01.280 --> 29:10.000]  They were big Obama supporters reportedly, big scene wearing, trendy kind of liberal type stuff.
[29:10.000 --> 29:17.040]  It's all your fault, Obama. And again, why would they send the Secret Service? Why would they send
[29:17.040 --> 29:23.680]  the Secret Service to the third press conference to go over on the feed before they went to the
[29:23.680 --> 29:28.480]  press conference itself to come over and threaten Dan Badandi? And again, we actually have the
[29:28.480 --> 29:32.400]  high-def video. Listeners pointed out these guys' Secret Service. They wouldn't identify themselves
[29:32.400 --> 29:36.480]  to Badandi. They just threatened him. There's Dan Badandi, and there they are. Everybody saw it
[29:36.480 --> 29:41.760]  coming over and getting in his face before and after. And you can see him pointing his finger
[29:41.760 --> 29:48.640]  at him saying, I'm not scared of you as they got up in his space. So he ended up getting his,
[29:48.640 --> 29:53.360]  and they did not want him handing out photos of quote, other suspects, which was the government
[29:53.360 --> 29:59.440]  drill. That's why the FBI said, only look at our photos. We're on the march. The empire's on the

[33:31.280 --> 33:34.800]  All right, folks, I'm going to open the phones up in the shower and the next ahead of Dan
[33:34.800 --> 33:39.360]  Badandi popping in and then the always informative Lindsey Williams is going to be coming on
[33:40.160 --> 33:44.320]  with us in the third hour, but I will open the phones up for him as well. I'll do the best job
[33:44.320 --> 33:56.080]  I can. Here is the toll free number to join us, 800-259-9231. 800-259-9231 and we will get you

[34:00.000 --> 34:07.280]  bring up. But I'd like to get your take on the younger brother that's supposedly still alive,
[34:07.280 --> 34:11.040]  admits to setting bombs with brother, says source of the Boston Globe.
[34:11.040 --> 34:15.600]  Also admits he and his brother Tamerlan were behind killing of MIT officer.
[34:16.320 --> 34:22.640]  So that's the new system in America where they arrest you, you're walking, they cut your larynx
[34:22.640 --> 34:28.160]  out and then you're guilty and then they put that out in the news so you can't get a fair trial.
[34:28.960 --> 34:34.720]  And then everybody chants USA, USA, USA is due process. What the USA is based on is
[34:34.720 --> 34:39.360]  flushed directly down the toilet like the babies at the different abortuaries owned by
[34:39.360 --> 34:48.720]  the Attorney General do. By the way, Kermit, not the frog, but the abortionist, they've dropped
[34:48.720 --> 34:52.960]  most of the charges. The judge is inexplicably is dropping most accounts against him.
[34:52.960 --> 34:58.000]  And even the Associated Press, not known for its accuracy or standing up for liberty had to say,
[34:58.000 --> 35:09.440]  and really no reason, inexplicably. We're talking about nine month old babies just chopped up,
[35:09.440 --> 35:14.400]  put in toilets and buckets to drown, blood all over the wall, all over the floor,
[35:14.400 --> 35:18.880]  just a filthy stench pit. And it all came out as women would go there and get so physically hurt.
[35:18.880 --> 35:27.520]  I mean, just imagine it. And the demonic ferret Kermit Gosnell,
[35:30.960 --> 35:37.600]  unbelievable House of Horrors doctor charged with killing live fetuses with scissors.
[35:37.600 --> 35:40.400]  You got the Planned Parenthood in Florida saying, well, no, I mean,
[35:40.400 --> 35:44.240]  we should be able to get rid of kids even after they're born. And that's the Journal of
[35:44.240 --> 35:55.360]  Bioethics came out last year and people didn't believe me when Paul Watson came out
[35:56.240 --> 36:00.320]  and wrote an article linking to it. They thought it must not be real, but see,
[36:00.320 --> 36:03.760]  just a year later, it's like, yeah, what is the big deal? Death panels are good, kill kids.
[36:06.320 --> 36:12.400]  See how things change, but here's the toll free number 800-259-9231.
[36:12.400 --> 36:20.800]  800-259-9231 and we will get you up and on the air.
[36:22.400 --> 36:28.480]  Now, I want to go ahead here and plug some new things that are on the Infowarsstore.com site.
[36:28.480 --> 36:32.960]  Not only do we have the best products up there at the lowest prices out there in many cases,
[36:33.840 --> 36:36.960]  it also supports the broadcast and everything we're doing.
[36:36.960 --> 36:43.520]  So I hope that you will go to the new Seed Center at Infowarsstore.com. There's books, t-shirts,
[36:43.520 --> 36:51.360]  films, so many other items, the whole Health Ranger line of great organic products as well,
[36:51.360 --> 36:55.840]  inner food. I mean, it really is a huge online high quality store, the Propure Water Filters.
[36:55.840 --> 37:02.640]  But the new Seed Center has seven different brands at the lowest prices out there.
[37:02.640 --> 37:06.320]  We either match the lowest price or we've been authorized in some cases to go below.
[37:06.320 --> 37:10.880]  But this is the lowest price that we've been authorized. People can sometimes buy it and
[37:10.880 --> 37:15.760]  sell it on eBay or something cheaper, secondhand. We have the lowest prices on every one of the,
[37:15.760 --> 37:19.920]  this is a year of research. Cuz a year goes by quick and I've told Weldon, find out the best
[37:19.920 --> 37:23.760]  companies, do the research, try them out, talk to people. And finally, a year later,
[37:23.760 --> 37:29.360]  cuz my crew's really busy, we have the huge Seed Center, six or is it seven different companies.
[37:29.360 --> 37:33.920]  Or is it seven different companies, and it's all up there, it's all up there.
[37:33.920 --> 37:39.840]  The Family Survival Emergency Seed Bank, the Urban Survival Emergency Seed Bank,
[37:40.560 --> 37:46.560]  the Deluxe Emergency Seed Bank, we've got the Seed Arc. We've got six, no, seven different,
[37:46.560 --> 37:52.080]  it was six, not seven different companies out there. The lowest prices, all the different
[37:52.080 --> 37:59.360]  choices to compare, one place, infowarsstore.com or call toll free. You get the Survival Seed Vault,
[37:59.360 --> 38:06.160]  the Seed Arcs, and all non-GMO, non-hybrid heirlooms. So they have that old fashioned
[38:06.160 --> 38:15.600]  thing of producing their own seeds in the fruit, in the vegetables, in the different plants.
[38:15.600 --> 38:21.360]  So you can replant the next year. Someday that'll be a conspiracy theory. Mommy, I heard once there
[38:21.360 --> 38:29.200]  were mommies. I heard once women breastfed. I heard once that plants had seeds and grew and
[38:29.200 --> 38:35.280]  didn't come out of a biotech engineering company. I heard once that children could walk and play.
[38:35.280 --> 38:40.560]  I heard once we live past 20. Of course, it won't even get to that. We'll be replaced with machines
[38:40.560 --> 38:44.160]  and the whole merger with the cybernetic interface if they have their way, it's all public.
[38:44.880 --> 38:49.920]  The end of humanity as we know it, if the global technocrats to the psychopaths on drooling power
[38:49.920 --> 38:54.320]  trips have their way, things are not gonna go the way they think they are because we're checkmating
[38:54.320 --> 38:58.240]  them right now, putting their whole agenda out. So when they try to implement it all,
[38:58.880 --> 39:02.560]  people under mind control will still agree with it and go along with it no matter what happens.
[39:02.560 --> 39:08.720]  But many people will not do that. Many people will go, wait, this was all true.
[39:09.840 --> 39:16.720]  Wow, they're admitting that 20 is the new 30 and 30 is the new 50 or whatever. I saw those studies
[39:16.720 --> 39:20.480]  out last week and they're admitting all the neurological disorders and dropping IQs and
[39:20.480 --> 39:26.560]  exploding cancer and the bisphenol A and the hydrofluorosolic acid. Just 10 years ago,
[39:26.560 --> 39:31.040]  I talk about this stuff designed to feminize men, hyper feminize women, reduce your fertility.
[39:32.160 --> 39:36.400]  And they would attack all over the media. Hey, suckers, the bisphenol A is coming out of most
[39:36.400 --> 39:41.760]  of the products now. They're passing laws overseas. Hey, suckers, countries are banning
[39:41.760 --> 39:47.200]  the cross-species GMO everywhere. You see, cuz it came out Monsanto's own laboratory,
[39:47.200 --> 39:50.880]  graffiterias won't have GMO, and the Queen of England won't have GMO.
[39:50.880 --> 39:54.640]  And the royalty all over the world won't have it, and the communist Chinese leadership won't have
[39:54.640 --> 40:00.320]  it. It's over, suckers. Go ahead, roll all your stuff out, okay? Just cuz you got a bunch of
[40:00.320 --> 40:06.160]  lemmings that'll go along with you. Natural law says just cuz you've got 50 plus percent
[40:06.160 --> 40:10.400]  begging to be slaves doesn't mean I get to be a slave just cuz you get people voting
[40:10.400 --> 40:15.360]  to make me a slave. You got that, suckers? You're the suckers that signed on to evil.
[40:15.360 --> 40:20.640]  You can go right back to Hades where you came from. Anyways, we've got the huge seed center,
[40:20.640 --> 40:25.680]  and it'll probably be eight different brands by next week. But these are the best,
[40:25.680 --> 40:30.080]  the most certified, highest quality, lowest prices, infowarsstore.com.
[40:30.080 --> 40:33.920]  This is part of a big rebellion. You wanna fight the New World Order, don't fight with your wife,
[40:33.920 --> 40:38.640]  don't fight with your husband. Get your kids off television, get them off GMO.
[40:38.640 --> 40:42.960]  Take care of your neighbors. Forgive your enemies who aren't really evil. If somebody's just dumb
[40:42.960 --> 40:47.360]  and weird, help them out. But if they're super evil, obviously, expose them and fight what
[40:47.360 --> 40:53.040]  they're doing. But get rid of old petty grudges that don't matter. Go to the next level.
[40:53.040 --> 40:58.880]  Plant seeds in your backyard. Drink filtered water. Give fruit and vegetables to your friends
[40:58.880 --> 41:03.920]  and neighbors. Get them into planting seeds. Become human again. Get back to what happened
[41:03.920 --> 41:10.960]  pre-technocracy, pre-1960s. Revolt against the matrix. Rediscover your humanity.
[41:13.840 --> 41:19.680]  Just the act of gardening, as I've told you so many times, is so human, the agrarian instinct,
[41:20.400 --> 41:24.800]  that it just activates all these other basic human instincts. That's why they don't
[41:24.800 --> 41:29.920]  want you doing it. Again, oblivion even talks about that. This is the reality.
[41:29.920 --> 41:33.280]  This is what we're dealing with. Everyone knows these universal truths.
[41:33.840 --> 41:36.240]  What's the movie with Kurt Russell, Universal Soldier,
[41:37.280 --> 41:41.600]  where he finally breaks his programming, gardening? And people make fun of that stuff.
[41:43.600 --> 41:46.560]  Anybody who goes out and digs in the dirt knows what I'm talking about. Anybody that goes in
[41:47.360 --> 41:50.000]  that way down, but Jean-Claude Van Damme had one by the same name.
[41:50.560 --> 41:55.600]  It's a very similar name. It's something soldier. It's a pretty good movie, actually. Pretty good
[41:55.600 --> 42:00.400]  for a B movie. I love Kurt Russell, man. I love him in The Thing. There's not many actors I want
[42:00.400 --> 42:04.560]  to meet, and I've met a lot of them. It kind of spoils it. But I mean, I would love to meet
[42:04.560 --> 42:08.800]  Kurt Russell. Actually, I had a chance to go to the premiere of one of the Grindhouse movies
[42:08.800 --> 42:12.240]  and meet him, and I didn't do it. It's funny. People you really want to meet or talk to,
[42:12.240 --> 42:21.280]  you don't want to. It's like I know where a lot of people hang out and go in Austin and stuff.
[42:21.280 --> 42:24.400]  And if I find out some famous person that I met in Austin, I'm like,
[42:24.400 --> 42:26.560]  if I find out some famous person eats at a restaurant,
[42:27.760 --> 42:29.920]  it's just called Soldier 1998. There you go.
[42:33.200 --> 42:38.400]  And then I almost won't go there because I don't want to run into him.
[42:41.920 --> 42:47.680]  And it's kind of like Drudge, because I really admire Drudge, all he's done, trailblazing,
[42:47.680 --> 42:51.600]  having the courage to really expose the New World Order more and more. The first to expose
[42:51.600 --> 42:55.200]  Bilderberg. I mean, just six, seven years ago, they said Bilderberg still didn't exist in America.
[42:55.760 --> 42:58.480]  And Drudge started posting links about it and broke the blockade.
[42:59.760 --> 43:04.240]  I mean, that's a big deal, and he has courage. So I admire that. And then Drudge tweeted yesterday
[43:04.240 --> 43:08.240]  saying, I've told friends privately, cuz I've been told this by some famous people that have
[43:08.240 --> 43:12.560]  talked to Drudge. They go, Drudge really likes you and says, you're gonna end up being just
[43:12.560 --> 43:18.080]  incredibly effective and famous and all this. He's a smart guy. I guess you can see trends.
[43:18.080 --> 43:23.120]  And I've been told that by a few people. I won't say their names even though they
[43:23.120 --> 43:26.000]  didn't say it was off record. And then sure enough, he sends a tweet out saying,
[43:26.000 --> 43:31.280]  privately told friends would be year of Alex Jones. Never met or talked to the man,
[43:31.280 --> 43:34.400]  but one hell of a broadcast in such a homogenized media.
[43:34.400 --> 43:39.520]  And again, I know I could get a hold of Drudge. He knows he could get a hold of me,
[43:40.320 --> 43:42.800]  cuz I've actually talked to some of his crew before. I'll just leave it at that.
[43:42.800 --> 43:49.600]  And we just, neither one ever tried to talk to the other one. Because I understand,
[43:50.400 --> 43:56.800]  it's almost like it's just you don't wanna ruin it, you know what I mean? But if Drudge ever
[43:56.800 --> 44:00.720]  comes through Austin, we'll take him out shooting and for barbecue. I think that's probably the
[44:00.720 --> 44:05.680]  best thing. So you're invited to come to Texas. If you're ever driving through on one of your
[44:05.680 --> 44:11.040]  road trips in your Corvettes and wanna go out shooting and barbecue, you're invited.
[44:11.040 --> 44:20.720]  But no need to break the silence. It's the opposite with me up here, gibbering,
[44:20.720 --> 44:26.320]  streaming consciousness. And then it's just different. I mean, it's the same thing. I know
[44:26.320 --> 44:32.880]  people that are neighbors to Robert Plant. I know his driver. I know where he goes and watches the
[44:32.880 --> 44:38.160]  team he owns, the soccer team. And I have a friend who's become kind of friends with him,
[44:38.160 --> 44:44.160]  because they're soccer fans. And I just would never, if I saw Robert Plant at a restaurant,
[44:44.160 --> 44:47.600]  I don't think I'd go up and talk to him. And again, it's not that I'm even intimidated by
[44:47.600 --> 44:52.560]  Robert Plant. It's just that I like his voice and his music so much over the years growing up with
[44:52.560 --> 44:56.400]  it, that it's almost like I'm not meant to talk to him. I don't know how to explain that.
[44:56.400 --> 45:00.240]  See, I'm now digressing. We got all these loaded phones. I said I'd go to your phone calls. I'm
[45:00.240 --> 45:06.160]  so neurotic, I can't seem to do it. Let me just say this separately. I'm on quite an adventure
[45:06.160 --> 45:13.840]  here. I know I'm real. And I know that we're having a big effect and really changing history
[45:13.840 --> 45:18.560]  right now. And having the White House attack us and go after us and dirty tricks and things I
[45:18.560 --> 45:25.520]  won't even get into on air. I know how real this is. And I see people conditioned to go along with
[45:25.520 --> 45:30.880]  it. But we do appreciate your support, spreading the word, cuz we're gonna risk our lives and
[45:30.880 --> 45:34.800]  treasure and names in this. Might as well try to beat the globalists. Might as well go all the way.
[45:34.800 --> 45:40.400]  I mean, I don't wanna fail at this. And I know we can win. It's that idea that we can't win
[45:40.400 --> 45:44.560]  against evil is why evil wins. Every time people figure out they don't have a choice and have to
[45:44.560 --> 45:48.960]  fight back, they end up defeating evil. Cuz evil falls in and of itself. That's why it tries to
[45:48.960 --> 45:56.160]  sell evil to make you evil, show that you're weak, so that you don't resist evil. But when you've
[45:56.160 --> 45:59.840]  got the Secret Service and the report's going up in the next 20 minutes at infowars.com,
[46:00.640 --> 46:04.480]  and we're gonna find the videos of the third press conference and show those so you can match them
[46:04.480 --> 46:10.880]  up to this. I mean, they're all over the place online. We'll do a report on nightly news about
[46:10.880 --> 46:15.600]  this as well. To have the Secret Service come over and threaten Badandi and tell him that he
[46:15.600 --> 46:19.520]  better not ask questions and that he better watch it and stuff and get in his space and have him
[46:19.520 --> 46:24.800]  stand up to him. And tell him that he's not afraid and that he's doing the right thing and he knows
[46:24.800 --> 46:29.920]  about the drill. And to now have the drill come out and to have a member of the US Senate saying
[46:29.920 --> 46:35.360]  that law enforcement agency may have had info about the bombing and in advance and let it
[46:35.360 --> 46:44.640]  happen. Senator Chambliss from Georgia, Saxby Chambliss is saying that. Well, that isn't a
[46:44.640 --> 46:52.400]  Southern gentry name, I don't know what is. And a New Hampshire lawmaker says Boston bombing was
[46:52.400 --> 47:05.520]  a government job and then it's because of me. Now, a lawmaker in New Hampshire, I'm gonna try
[47:05.520 --> 47:09.600]  to get her on. The social media ramblings of a woman who read about conspiracy theory on
[47:09.600 --> 47:15.200]  infowars wouldn't usually be newsworthy, but it's the case. The woman is a lawmaker in New Hampshire
[47:15.200 --> 47:18.480]  state legislature who thinks the government is responsible for the Boston bombings.
[47:18.480 --> 47:24.800]  Three-term Republican representative, Stella Termblay, I believe you pronounce it,
[47:24.800 --> 47:31.280]  first made her case in a scare quotes, saturating Facebook post on Friday,
[47:31.280 --> 47:35.680]  writing to Glenn Beck, she said, just as you said what happened, top down, bottom up.
[47:35.680 --> 47:40.560]  The Boston Marathon was a black ops terrorist attack. One suspect killed, the other one,
[47:40.560 --> 47:44.320]  maybe two before they even have a chance to speak. Notice they cut out his throat,
[47:44.320 --> 47:46.560]  so that happened. He's walking out of the boat and then,
[47:46.560 --> 47:56.240]  and drones are now terrorist attacks by our own government. Sad day, but wake up to all of us.
[47:56.240 --> 48:01.600]  First there was a suspect, then there wasn't. Infowars broke the story and they knew
[48:03.760 --> 48:12.800]  they had been found out. And then the New York magazine demonizes and attacks that.
[48:12.800 --> 48:18.400]  And again, they're all over the news. The Tamerlan linked Infowars conspiracy
[48:18.400 --> 48:24.160]  terrorist Alex Jones, alleged Boston bomber was Alex Jones' conspiracy fan, on and on and on.
[48:24.160 --> 48:32.320]  All because the media, the Associated Press, who said there were WMDs in Iraq and
[48:32.320 --> 48:37.040]  said that there weren't bullets, but then there were bullets. And the Associated Press caught
[48:37.040 --> 48:43.520]  pushing propaganda a million times. Now just talks to somebody from overseas and well,
[48:43.520 --> 48:47.280]  yeah, and I think he visited infowars.com. Well, it's my fault. See, I told you they
[48:47.280 --> 48:54.560]  wanted to blame the Tea Party one way or another. One way or another, who has that song?
[48:54.560 --> 48:58.400]  One way or another, I'm gonna get you, get you, get you, get you.
[49:01.280 --> 49:03.280]  I know who that is, it's gonna pop my head in just a minute.
[49:03.280 --> 49:06.960]  It doesn't matter, you just type it into the search engine and it'll tell you. I mean,
[49:06.960 --> 49:10.880]  one way or another, they wanna throw it back on us. See, I'm saying they have a history of this,
[49:10.880 --> 49:14.800]  they're the number one suspects, and then there's a drill. And the senator says it looks like they
[49:14.800 --> 49:19.760]  knew it didn't stop it. Duh, but see, I'm wrong because I'm dangerous, because I'm right.
[49:21.120 --> 49:25.840]  Blondie, thank you, that's what I thought. So this is the type of stuff we're talking about.
[49:25.840 --> 49:31.520]  So yes, I'm in danger of being demonized, attacked, shut up, you name it. I'm in danger.
[49:31.520 --> 49:38.800]  Attacked, shut up, you name it. I'm now getting, I'm not gonna even get into it. The point is,
[49:38.800 --> 49:44.000]  is that this is real. And if they have a history of it, how do they say it's crazy to go, hey,
[49:44.000 --> 49:48.000]  we should look at who's been caught doing golf, the Tonkin, Ajax, Northwoods.
[49:49.200 --> 49:51.920]  The government cooked the bomb, trained the drivers, gave them the detonators, let them do
[49:51.920 --> 49:56.800]  it. World Trade Center attack 1993. Shut up, that's your opinion. No, it's not, it came out
[49:56.800 --> 50:04.080]  in federal court, it's admitted. I mean, it just comes out the 77 bombing mastermind was an MI6
[50:04.080 --> 50:08.000]  agent. And the media spins it and goes, he must have been a double agent. And our government's
[50:08.000 --> 50:14.160]  funding Al-Qaeda in Libya and Syria. There's the New York Times terrorist plots hatched by the FBI,
[50:14.160 --> 50:19.440]  April 28, 2012. Goes on to say most plots were completely created,
[50:19.440 --> 50:26.960]  manufactured, and authorized, and funded, and run, and commanded, commanded.
[50:26.960 --> 50:31.040]  By the New World Order, global shadowy corporations manipulating our governments.
[50:31.680 --> 50:35.280]  And of course, they run the radical Muslims. And of course, they run the police state here.
[50:35.280 --> 50:38.960]  They put radical Muslims in to undermine secular Muslim governments,
[50:38.960 --> 50:41.760]  so they never get a civilization. That's part of the public plan,
[50:41.760 --> 50:46.560]  clash of civilizations, strategy of tension. And over here, they use the Muslim threat.
[50:46.560 --> 50:51.440]  In every case, the terrorists are on government welfare, they're protected, the government knows,
[50:51.440 --> 50:54.640]  they attack us. And the government says, hey, Alex, you're gonna have to buy any
[50:54.640 --> 50:58.640]  terrorism insurance now. We're gonna put you on a no fly list. We're gonna stick our hands
[50:58.640 --> 51:02.560]  down your pants. We're gonna read your email, because you're all suspects now.

[54:28.800 --> 54:33.760]  Ladies and gentlemen, the Russian mainstream media is now leaking why the Russians called
[54:33.760 --> 54:40.160]  for an FBI investigation of Tamerlan, Zarnov or Zarnoz or however you pronounce it.
[54:40.800 --> 54:44.640]  They are now coming out, ladies and gentlemen, document cam please.
[54:44.640 --> 54:49.440]  This is in the main line Russian news and been picked up all across Russia.
[54:50.320 --> 54:53.200]  Tamerlan recruited via the Georgetown Foundation,
[54:53.200 --> 54:58.960]  foreign Jamestown, US nonprofit, the board of directors of NGOs previously entered one
[54:58.960 --> 55:05.200]  of the ideologists of US foreign policy, Zbigniew Brzezinski, who calls for using terror states
[55:05.200 --> 55:10.320]  up against Russia, was engaged in recruiting residents of North Caucasus to work in the
[55:10.320 --> 55:17.280]  interest of the United States and Georgia. And that's why he had a alias that's confirmed.
[55:17.280 --> 55:20.960]  That's why the family said it must be a setup, because the family are pretty,
[55:20.960 --> 55:24.640]  some are some heavy hitter lawyers and people working for oil companies.
[55:25.280 --> 55:29.280]  And this is huge, because Kurt Nemo wrote an article on Saturday,
[55:30.080 --> 55:34.800]  predicting it would even listed the Jamestown group, because that's the group they use.
[55:34.800 --> 55:37.680]  And if this is confirmed, and the Russians are saying it is,
[55:38.560 --> 55:45.760]  and of course he had aliases and things, this is a smoking gun of information. So all you've got to
[55:45.760 --> 55:52.400]  do is put Tamerlan recruited via the Georgian Foundation, and it'll come up for you on the
[55:52.400 --> 55:56.960]  search engine. I said I'd go to calls, and I will, this is big breaking news.
[55:56.960 --> 56:01.040]  Ask Kurt Nemo to print me his Saturday article, and there it is.
[56:06.800 --> 56:11.520]  Tamerlan Zarnov recruited via the Georgian Foundation, and Georgia, of course, has been
[56:11.520 --> 56:17.120]  the main hotspot to train Muslim terrorists to attack the Russian held areas. And again,
[56:17.120 --> 56:20.640]  I'm no fan of Vladimir Putin or what they're doing, that's other tyranny.
[56:20.640 --> 56:27.680]  But the West, the bankers, are funding radical Islam in Chechnya, in Dagestan, in Georgia,
[56:28.880 --> 56:35.040]  just everywhere to bomb and blow up Russian facilities on the borders, and in Russian
[56:35.040 --> 56:41.680]  held areas like Dagestan and Chechnya. And it's a fact, I mean, these are Playboy guys
[56:42.240 --> 56:45.600]  who thought they were part of a drill, and then that's why he climbs out of the boat,
[56:45.600 --> 56:50.240]  and there's no blood on his neck or shirt. He walks over and they go lay down, little baby.
[56:50.240 --> 56:56.800]  Here's the shot, give me that skeleton. And then they are coming out saying,
[56:56.800 --> 57:05.120]  right now, the younger brother admits to setting bombs with brother, source says.
[57:05.120 --> 57:09.680]  Have they ever got me in jail and they've cut my larynx out? And they just come out
[57:09.680 --> 57:13.280]  in the Boston Globe or the Austin Market Station or wherever and just say, Alex Jones admits he
[57:13.280 --> 57:18.880]  blew up the Capitol. Alex Jones admits he ran over the little kids. Alex Jones admits,
[57:18.880 --> 57:24.880]  Alex Jones wrote a suicide note, he committed suicide. No, no, no, and look, we're the only
[57:24.880 --> 57:30.000]  ones on the trail. And that's why they're demonizing us, and that's why they're demonizing
[57:30.000 --> 57:35.200]  things like DrudgeReport.com, because he's got the huevos to push some of the stuff we're putting
[57:35.200 --> 57:40.240]  out, because it makes sense. And now there was a drill, the senator says there's evidence they
[57:40.240 --> 57:45.760]  knew and let it happen, no kidding. But I thought I'm the conspiracy theorist, who stands to gain
[57:45.760 --> 57:49.920]  from this? Who has a history of this? Who's been caught doing it over and over again?
[57:49.920 --> 57:54.480]  I mean, we'd be idiots. If we didn't have lawmakers that would take our liberties and
[57:54.480 --> 57:58.560]  give hundreds of billions of dollars in domestic contracts to their own families
[57:58.560 --> 58:03.200]  when there was a terror attack, they wouldn't be doing this. A free country doesn't get rid
[58:03.200 --> 58:09.920]  of its liberties cuz three people get blown up or two cops get shot. A free country doesn't give
[58:09.920 --> 58:14.560]  into terrorism. The only people that would tell you give into terrorism and give up your liberty
[58:14.560 --> 58:21.520]  are the terrorists, duh, duh. Why do terrorists stage terrorism? To get a political
[58:21.520 --> 58:26.640]  goal. And what's that? Power. Put us in power. They're in power. And they want to get rid of
[58:26.640 --> 58:31.120]  the Bill of Rights, the Constitution, and they're creating terror attacks, they're manufacturing
[58:31.120 --> 58:36.400]  them, they're provocateur-ing them, they are funding them, they are commanding them.
[58:36.400 --> 58:41.840]  Our number two straight ahead. This is incredible news. Of course, he was on an NGO.
[58:41.840 --> 58:46.080]  They had aliases. They work for the new world order.
[58:46.080 --> 58:50.400]  This is GCN, the Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[58:53.760 --> 58:58.720]  I had tried everything. I'd cut back the amount of food I was eating. I was lifting weights and
[58:58.720 --> 59:03.760]  jogging, but nothing was working. My body was literally starving for minerals and trace
[59:03.760 --> 59:09.520]  elements as well as key vitamins. And as soon as I had that, I immediately could eat half of what
[59:09.520 --> 59:15.520]  I was eating previously and be satisfied. I was so excited. I was so excited. I was so excited.
[59:15.520 --> 59:20.480]  Now there are hundreds of great products at Infowarsteam.com, but I want to point out the
[59:20.480 --> 59:30.000]  three that have helped me lose 37 pounds in just two months. Products like Beyond Tangy Tangerine,
[59:30.000 --> 59:35.200]  Holland Burst, and Rebound. When I started taking the Tangy Tangerine and other products every day,
[59:35.200 --> 59:41.760]  I lost more than 37 pounds in just two months. Now that's results. I want to challenge my listeners
[59:41.760 --> 59:48.080]  to go to Infowarsteam.com and to order just three of their products. And you will see the changes
[59:48.080 --> 59:52.240]  in the way you look, feel, and in your appetite almost immediately.
[59:52.240 --> 59:56.560]  Start your journey to health and wellness today. Infowarsteam.com.
[59:56.560 --> 01:00:08.720]  Waging war on corruption. Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:12.240 --> 01:00:19.520]  Big Brother. Mainstream media. Government cover-ups. You want answers? Well, so does he.
[01:00:19.520 --> 01:00:28.480]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network. And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:31.600 --> 01:00:37.120]  800-259-9231. I'll do what I said I'd do, and I'll cover news at the bottom of the hour.
[01:00:37.120 --> 01:00:43.920]  Dan Modondi calling us. I'll go to your phone calls now. 800-259-9231. Coming up, Judge Janet
[01:00:43.920 --> 01:00:49.360]  Napolitano, you have to deport illegal immigrants. And in Florida, a food stamp recruiter deals with
[01:00:50.160 --> 01:00:55.360]  wrenching choices. Washington Post talks about the government recruiting more people onto welfare,
[01:00:56.000 --> 01:00:59.360]  because they want to bankrupt the country, okay?
[01:01:00.400 --> 01:01:04.320]  And also, Napolitano now admits the Saudi student was put on the watch list,
[01:01:04.880 --> 01:01:09.440]  even though she denied that previously, and said that they weren't deporting him,
[01:01:09.440 --> 01:01:19.120]  though now they are. I mean, just a pack of liars. 800-259-9231, we'll get you up on air.
[01:01:19.120 --> 01:01:26.080]  The big news is the AP came out with no proof, said they talked to somebody overseas. And the
[01:01:27.040 --> 01:01:31.920]  brothers liked infowars.com. And then the media ran with that, and now they're my biggest fans,
[01:01:31.920 --> 01:01:36.400]  and that I caused the bombing. And of course, I'm saying we should look at the globalists who
[01:01:36.400 --> 01:01:40.720]  stand to gain from this and have a history of it. And there is a drill, and the US Senator now says,
[01:01:40.720 --> 01:01:43.920]  looks like they knew and let it happen, that's mainstream news.
[01:01:43.920 --> 01:01:50.880]  But see, it doesn't matter. Folks, I'm the terrorist, I mean, come on. I told you they
[01:01:50.880 --> 01:01:56.000]  wanted to blame us, and they're doing it. Because no one's got what it takes to challenge these
[01:01:56.000 --> 01:02:03.840]  people. We're all supposed to just lay down, and everybody's so afraid, so afraid of all this stuff
[01:02:03.840 --> 01:02:07.760]  that statistically isn't even that dangerous. If the government kills me, that's just the way it is.
[01:02:09.520 --> 01:02:12.800]  I still drive in my car every day, even though that's the most dangerous thing I do. I risk my
[01:02:12.800 --> 01:02:18.800]  life every day, and I'm aware of it. And I know what GMO does, but I still let my kids eat it
[01:02:18.800 --> 01:02:23.600]  sometimes cuz I'm lazy. I know what cell phones do, but I'm lazy. I mean, just a lot of it is,
[01:02:23.600 --> 01:02:28.320]  is that we're all killing ourselves to live, basically. And I'm not gonna sit here and just
[01:02:28.320 --> 01:02:33.200]  let the worst of the worst run over everything, I'm done. Let's go ahead and talk to Chris in
[01:02:33.200 --> 01:02:38.160]  New York, and we'll go to Mario and Nick and Liz and Derek and everybody. Go ahead, Chris,
[01:02:38.160 --> 01:02:44.000]  thanks for holding. Hi, Alex. Thank you for taking my call, and thank you very much for
[01:02:44.000 --> 01:02:50.000]  your efforts. I got a couple of points that I wanna stress. Number one, people need to know
[01:02:50.000 --> 01:02:56.320]  that this Boston thing is to take our civil liberties. People need to know that, understand
[01:02:56.320 --> 01:03:00.000]  that the Second Amendment, the Constitution, the Bill of Rights needs to be defended.
[01:03:00.000 --> 01:03:07.040]  And another point is that some of the reporters out there that need to come out,
[01:03:07.040 --> 01:03:13.440]  more people like Rudowsky, Badandi, yourself, need to come out and get on the Obama's face
[01:03:14.160 --> 01:03:22.400]  and Biden's bike helicopter face, and ask how did they feel when the VP called for a new world order
[01:03:22.400 --> 01:03:28.640]  one week before the bombing. Another thing is that I come from a third world country.
[01:03:28.640 --> 01:03:38.800]  I saw on your page that probably Obama might have a gun ban from importation.
[01:03:38.800 --> 01:03:44.640]  You know, he's saying that he's going to adopt the UN policy and do it, and Biden has said they will,
[01:03:44.640 --> 01:03:49.280]  and they had a pro-gun group on my YouTube saying I'm a liar. Even when it's official,
[01:03:49.280 --> 01:03:54.000]  people can't even admit it's happening. Well, let me tell the people this. I come from a country
[01:03:54.000 --> 01:04:00.800]  that has the same thing. You cannot bring guns in, so the only thing that that leads to
[01:04:00.800 --> 01:04:09.520]  is for contraband. Number two, only crooks and the people in power are the only ones who are
[01:04:09.520 --> 01:04:14.160]  going to have guns, and whatever guns are going to be left, they're going to be very, very expensive.
[01:04:14.160 --> 01:04:24.160]  People cannot buy them, and that leads to more, okay?
[01:04:24.160 --> 01:04:28.640]  The people running our society are criminals, and they have a criminal instinct that they're
[01:04:28.640 --> 01:04:32.560]  scared. I mean, look, I mean, people in Texas aren't scared out in parking lots,
[01:04:32.560 --> 01:04:37.200]  and even see looking people are scared of you. I'll be quite honest with you. In Texas,
[01:04:37.200 --> 01:04:39.680]  everybody's scared of people driving around in pickup trucks,
[01:04:39.680 --> 01:04:45.840]  because they know white guys in pickup trucks are packing guns. And I've seen the statistics.
[01:04:45.840 --> 01:04:50.240]  Thieves, whether they be white, black, it doesn't matter, will tend to pick on, quote, immigrants
[01:04:50.240 --> 01:04:55.520]  who they know come from countries, this has been proven, who don't have gun culture. So in fact,
[01:04:55.520 --> 01:04:58.960]  a lot of immigrant groups feed on their own immigrants because they know they're probably
[01:04:58.960 --> 01:05:04.560]  not carrying guns. Criminals hate the gun culture. They hate the fact that good people are armed and
[01:05:04.560 --> 01:05:11.520]  aren't going to roll over. Now that we have moved into the winter season, there is an increased need
[01:05:11.520 --> 01:05:17.200]  to support our immunity and health. At Silver Lungs, we are committed to meeting your needs

[01:05:47.200 --> 01:05:52.800]  chemistry of aloe vera to quickly penetrate and nourish the skin while delivering the silver more

[01:08:12.400 --> 01:08:19.680]  Big Brother. Mainstream media. Government cover-ups. You want answers? Well, so does he.
[01:08:19.680 --> 01:08:28.720]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network. And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:08:40.000 --> 01:08:43.760]  All right, we're going to be taking your phone calls throughout the hour. We've confirmed the
[01:08:43.760 --> 01:08:48.880]  Secret Service threatened our reporter and we have video proof that that article is going up
[01:08:48.880 --> 01:08:53.280]  at infoawards.com and told him not to ask questions in America. So the Secret Service
[01:08:53.280 --> 01:08:58.560]  doesn't just deal with counterfeiting or with protecting the POTUS. Now it deals with telling
[01:08:58.560 --> 01:09:03.200]  reporters they can't ask questions in America about drills that happened and we know why.
[01:09:04.000 --> 01:09:11.200]  It is being reported by WSBTV. We have this up at infoawards.com. Senator Chambliss,
[01:09:11.200 --> 01:09:17.040]  law enforcement agency may have had info about Boston bombing in advance and done nothing and
[01:09:17.040 --> 01:09:23.040]  not shared the info. It turns out that they were both on welfare. And here's the big bombshell being
[01:09:23.040 --> 01:09:32.960]  reported by Russian News. We have this all linked up on infoawards.com. Tamerlan recruited via
[01:09:32.960 --> 01:09:39.040]  Georgian Foundation, working to help in conjunction with the Georgian Special Services
[01:09:39.040 --> 01:09:44.080]  and Americans. And then they help fund the different radical Muslim groups,
[01:09:44.080 --> 01:09:49.440]  including the Bin Laden of Chechnya, who this guy reportedly admired, because they're using
[01:09:49.440 --> 01:09:54.800]  them to attack the Russians. And who is the father of this 1979 plan, strategy of tension
[01:09:54.800 --> 01:10:00.960]  and proxy state? Here it is, it's the Jamestown US nonprofit. The board of directors of NGOs
[01:10:03.840 --> 01:10:07.920]  entered one of the ideologists of the US foreign policies, a big new Brzezinski,
[01:10:08.480 --> 01:10:12.880]  has engaged in recruiting residents of North Caucasus to work on the entrance to the United
[01:10:12.880 --> 01:10:17.040]  States and Georgia. They mean the mega banks that have captured us. They're now using America
[01:10:17.040 --> 01:10:21.680]  in the exploitation phase. They'll know what that means at the CIA against the next country.
[01:10:22.480 --> 01:10:27.280]  Unbelievable. According to the reports of the Colonel Chief Directorate Counterintelligence
[01:10:27.280 --> 01:10:33.440]  Department Ministry of Internal Affairs of Georgian, Gregory Chanteria, the Minister of
[01:10:33.440 --> 01:10:41.200]  Internal Affairs, and just goes through workshops with the military. I mean, this guy was a commando.
[01:10:41.200 --> 01:10:45.600]  And that's why they had to get him dead immediately, whatever he knew.
[01:10:46.240 --> 01:10:50.320]  And I said, these guys are dead. Well, they shoot the boat full of holes,
[01:10:50.320 --> 01:10:56.400]  looks like 15 machine guns, you have bullets every inch. They come up and I heard the live
[01:10:56.400 --> 01:11:02.160]  police scanners. They're like, no, the media's gotta feed right when they were getting ready
[01:11:02.160 --> 01:11:07.840]  to do the deed. So then they say, okay, come out. He puts his hands up, climbs out, and minutes
[01:11:07.840 --> 01:11:13.280]  later, is unconscious with his throat being chopped open. And then barely living so they
[01:11:13.280 --> 01:11:17.520]  could say, leave it open. We can kill him if we want, or maybe set him up or get him to confess
[01:11:17.520 --> 01:11:21.360]  and then kill him. And for those that don't know, you never have someone in intensive care and
[01:11:21.360 --> 01:11:25.920]  critical condition and then have them say, a source, he admits to doing it all.
[01:11:27.360 --> 01:11:31.040]  Never gonna get a fair trial, folks. Never gonna get a fair trial. And again,
[01:11:31.040 --> 01:11:34.560]  am I saying there aren't Muslim extremists? There are. The globalists are putting them in
[01:11:34.560 --> 01:11:39.040]  charge of Libya, in charge of Syria to commit massacres of Christians in both countries.
[01:11:39.040 --> 01:11:45.840]  And Muslim minority groups, Shiite and other subgroups that are even more
[01:11:46.480 --> 01:11:53.120]  rare like the Alawites and the Zoroastrians. We've got all this going on. See, folks,
[01:11:53.120 --> 01:11:57.120]  you're an expert on baseball and football or your own business. I'm an expert on history.
[01:11:57.120 --> 01:12:01.600]  And I'm just giving you the basics. I mean, for someone informed, it's like you have 2020 vision.
[01:12:01.600 --> 01:12:06.080]  For people that don't know where the caucuses are or don't know about foundations or haven't read
[01:12:06.080 --> 01:12:11.040]  all of Brzezinski's books, who don't watch CFR meetings, who don't read foreign affairs.
[01:12:11.040 --> 01:12:14.640]  I mean, foreign affairs said last year, yeah, we're running Al Qaeda, we need them.
[01:12:15.280 --> 01:12:21.360]  Al Qaeda's doing a great job. These are good fighters. They wear black uniforms with the
[01:12:21.360 --> 01:12:25.840]  Al Qaeda patch. And they go into people's houses and say, we're gonna kill your whole family
[01:12:25.840 --> 01:12:28.720]  if you don't drive this suicide bomb into that police convoy up there.
[01:12:28.720 --> 01:12:34.480]  I mean, you don't even know. This guy's wife and kids say we're gonna kill him. You don't know.
[01:12:34.480 --> 01:12:40.880]  I know this. The aunt, who's a tough as nails lawyer in Canada, is a listener. We confirmed
[01:12:40.880 --> 01:12:45.360]  that. I talked to her. She said, I'm ready to go public. I called her back and she's crying.
[01:12:45.360 --> 01:12:48.880]  She goes, they will crush me like a bug if they're listening. I can't talk.
[01:12:48.880 --> 01:12:56.320]  I love my family. The America, I thought the West was free. It's terrible, it's terrible.
[01:12:56.320 --> 01:13:01.840]  It's terrible. Obviously, is my summation, they called up and said, listen, bitch,
[01:13:01.840 --> 01:13:05.760]  we're gonna kill your kids if you don't shut up. You got that straight. And by the way,
[01:13:05.760 --> 01:13:08.800]  she was on record saying they were threatening her. And I'm sorry to use that word, but that's
[01:13:08.800 --> 01:13:15.280]  how they talk to you. Cuz I've gotten the phone calls. They love to call my wife up and tell her
[01:13:15.920 --> 01:13:19.840]  about what she was just talking about. Let her know, hey, yeah, okay, you heard that.
[01:13:19.840 --> 01:13:26.080]  Now you know we're listening. I will cut your head off, but they'll say it in a lot more
[01:13:26.080 --> 01:13:31.760]  vicious, it's like a movie. Do you understand me, you bleeping, you know what? But you know I'll do
[01:13:31.760 --> 01:13:38.720]  a lot more before I do that. See, you don't know who runs America. And so I'm up here just going,
[01:13:38.720 --> 01:13:44.080]  all right, all out, I know who you are. I know what you've done. You think they hate
[01:13:44.080 --> 01:13:47.600]  Iraqis and killed over a million of them with starvation and all the rest of it in sanctions?
[01:13:48.560 --> 01:13:51.920]  And then they hate our troops even more. They shoot them up with deadly shots. They brainwash
[01:13:51.920 --> 01:13:54.960]  them, they put them on deadly drugs, and now they're gonna take their guns. They hate our
[01:13:54.960 --> 01:14:00.640]  troops 100 times more. You're just nothing but a drone. You're nothing but a biological
[01:14:00.640 --> 01:14:06.240]  android. You're nothing but a clone, cloned by this culture. They call us biological androids,
[01:14:06.240 --> 01:14:09.200]  Ray Kurzweil in all of them. He's a big new Brzezinski.
[01:14:10.160 --> 01:14:15.360]  You are a programmable guy that goes and watches Olympus is Falling and believes all this and
[01:14:15.360 --> 01:14:22.400]  really thinks you're a hero. G.I. Joe, great American hero. Joe, Joe, you don't work for Joe.
[01:14:22.400 --> 01:14:30.720]  Joe got taken over. The G.I. Joe command base is run by Cobra. Do you understand that? And I use
[01:14:30.720 --> 01:14:34.880]  a child analogy to get through to you because that's your main programming template in North
[01:14:34.880 --> 01:14:39.680]  America. They're on record with that. That was all Pentagon directed. You understand you work
[01:14:39.680 --> 01:14:46.400]  for Cobra. You dress like Cobra. You have the tactics of Cobra. You are Cobra. Hail Cobra.
[01:14:46.400 --> 01:14:52.000]  You wanna be little boys or do you wanna really join the Republic?
[01:14:53.600 --> 01:14:57.920]  It's all these stupid G.I. Joe movies and stuff where the White House is attacked.
[01:14:57.920 --> 01:15:03.360]  The White House is run by Cobra. It's run by chaos. It's run by Specter.
[01:15:05.360 --> 01:15:10.480]  How do you think MI6 that Ian Fleming wrote about, he worked for him, he was an OSS,
[01:15:10.480 --> 01:15:14.880]  where the robber barons are gonna release a bio weapon to kill everybody.
[01:15:14.880 --> 01:15:18.160]  He wrote Moonraker in the 50s. That's the plan.
[01:15:21.360 --> 01:15:30.160]  Oblivion is the plan. Zardoz is the plan. It's the only plan. And you better pray to God they
[01:15:30.160 --> 01:15:36.880]  don't get this through. Because if Cobra, the snake, the devil, the Black Pyramid gets control,
[01:15:36.880 --> 01:15:41.440]  it's all over for you. So that's why it doesn't matter if they kill me.
[01:15:41.440 --> 01:15:45.680]  Doesn't matter cuz my family has no future if we don't beat them. Sure what, I'm gonna live
[01:15:45.680 --> 01:15:51.120]  another five, ten years, play ball with this, maybe 20. Play ball, think I'm part of the elite,
[01:15:51.120 --> 01:15:54.640]  live in some high rise all guarded when the bio weapon gets released.
[01:15:54.640 --> 01:15:59.040]  We'll all be dying up in that high rise. I'll be on the phone going I thought I was part of the
[01:15:59.040 --> 01:16:04.160]  team. These idiot operatives trying to discredit us online go Alex Jones admits he's had family
[01:16:04.160 --> 01:16:09.600]  in the government. The proof, it's secret. I'm the one saying it on air. I'm the one telling
[01:16:09.600 --> 01:16:16.160]  you idiots. And I'm not gonna say more cuz I don't wanna get people in my family in trouble.
[01:16:16.880 --> 01:16:20.080]  The point is the New World Order's real, you fools.
[01:16:23.200 --> 01:16:27.040]  They run little kids, they run the snuff films, they run the drugs, they run it all.
[01:16:27.040 --> 01:16:31.760]  And because you act like a bunch of naive chumps, this whole thing's gonna come down on us.
[01:16:32.560 --> 01:16:37.120]  To every police officer in this country, to every FBI agent, to every Secret Service agent,
[01:16:37.120 --> 01:16:42.880]  you work for Spectre. You work for chaos. You work for Cobra. How do they get power?
[01:16:42.880 --> 01:16:50.240]  They stage a terror attack using Spectre, using Cobra. Who is Cobra? Arms dealing, drug dealing,
[01:16:50.240 --> 01:16:54.320]  money laundering group wearing mask. They wear mask, ladies and gentlemen,
[01:16:54.320 --> 01:16:59.680]  because they're the corporate CEOs. And they're manipulating the governments against each other.
[01:16:59.680 --> 01:17:05.600]  Cobra runs the Muslims. Cobra runs the CIA. Cobra runs it all. Cobra is real.
[01:17:05.600 --> 01:17:09.200]  Haven't you people figured any of this out yet? Then you don't have a heyday with that.
[01:17:09.200 --> 01:17:15.760]  You can call it whatever you want. Cobra is in control of America. And Cobra says the veterans
[01:17:15.760 --> 01:17:20.320]  and the gun owners and the conservatives and the people that say there's a foreign New World Order
[01:17:20.320 --> 01:17:28.000]  banking takeover happening. They're saying that we're the bad guys. That's what Cobra would say.
[01:17:28.000 --> 01:17:32.800]  That's what Spectre would say. That's what Goldfinger would say, because that's who those
[01:17:32.800 --> 01:17:48.000]  people are. James Bond works for Spectre. James Bond is Spectre, is Cobra.
[01:17:51.200 --> 01:17:58.080]  They are the bad guys. And the local cop doesn't know that because you are just like the man in
[01:17:58.080 --> 01:18:06.400]  oblivion. Go see it, and then you'll understand it. It's an allegory of what you are. It's an
[01:18:06.400 --> 01:18:14.320]  allegory of a program. They see you as a flesh and blood robot. They think you're a dumb animal
[01:18:14.320 --> 01:18:19.440]  that cannot get above the program. And the issue is you obviously can't be told this, can you?
[01:18:19.440 --> 01:18:23.200]  Your kid's gonna have to get diagnosed with cancer. You're gonna have to get diagnosed
[01:18:23.200 --> 01:18:28.000]  with neurological disorders early. You're going to have to see things in your business, in your life,
[01:18:28.000 --> 01:18:32.800]  that are so evil that you finally make a break with it. You decide, I was talking to one of my
[01:18:32.800 --> 01:18:38.320]  uncles who saw a lot of stuff, I'll leave it at that. And he said, there will come a point in
[01:18:38.320 --> 01:18:43.040]  these people's lives, these operators' lives, and these corporate people and the rest of them.
[01:18:43.040 --> 01:18:47.040]  Where you've gone along and accepted so much evil and finally something so bad,
[01:18:47.680 --> 01:18:52.400]  you decide to jump into it and go with it, or you repent and get completely out of it.
[01:18:52.400 --> 01:18:58.720]  That's the only way. You gotta have a clean break with all this stuff.
[01:18:58.720 --> 01:19:03.360]  That's the only way, ladies and gentlemen, this thing is taking us to oblivion.
[01:19:04.240 --> 01:19:08.720]  There is no getting out of this if they win. There is no good ending.
[01:19:10.640 --> 01:19:14.160]  You people that think you're true believers in this, you are not true believers.
[01:19:14.160 --> 01:19:22.960]  You're not saving the Earth with your Earth cult crap. That's another fake story you've been given.
[01:19:22.960 --> 01:19:30.480]  This is not the island. It's a projection, okay? This is not, folks, it's THX 1138. It's the island.
[01:19:30.480 --> 01:19:36.560]  It's oblivion. You are in a controlled paradigm. You've got to come out of it. It is the matrix,
[01:19:36.560 --> 01:19:40.480]  but it isn't a physical matrix yet. They're trying to insert us into that.
[01:19:40.480 --> 01:19:47.440]  That's a 1970s Pentagon plan. Look it up. They have this whole thing planned out.
[01:19:49.600 --> 01:19:56.800]  And it is crazy. You are living in 2013. All right, I promise. I'm going to Mario. I'm going
[01:19:56.800 --> 01:20:01.360]  to Liz. I'm going to Derek. I'm going to Nick. I'm going to Jenny. I'm going to all of you.
[01:20:02.000 --> 01:20:07.200]  But it's now come out that these guys were CIA. They were CIA.
[01:20:07.200 --> 01:20:12.400]  We all know that Berkey water purification systems are the most trusted name in water

[01:21:10.800 --> 01:21:15.360]  your financial affairs? I continue to hear stories about property seizures, frozen bank
[01:21:15.360 --> 01:21:19.840]  accounts confiscation of stocks and bonds. It makes me wonder if the US citizen will
[01:21:19.840 --> 01:21:24.560]  ever again have the right to life liberty and the pursuit of happiness. Unfortunately,
[01:21:24.560 --> 01:21:30.080]  with the Drug and Money Laundering Act, the IRS Revenue Ruling 6045 of 1984 and the Trading

[01:24:21.120 --> 01:24:35.040]  Resistance to tyrants is obedience to God. It's Alex Jones.
[01:24:41.280 --> 01:24:45.040]  If the government can shut down a whole city and point guns at people and take you out of your
[01:24:45.040 --> 01:24:49.920]  houses and then rationalize it, they can do anything. Like take your bank accounts, like make
[01:24:49.920 --> 01:24:55.280]  you take vaccines, like conscript your children for domestic homeland operations. And of course,
[01:24:55.280 --> 01:24:59.680]  there'll be no economy left, so you'll want that job and you'll want the authority, the rock
[01:24:59.680 --> 01:25:05.520]  star-ism that Ever Bernays talked about of being in the government town, a rock star with a bunch
[01:25:05.520 --> 01:25:10.800]  of narcissists strutting around. That's like North Korea. We are becoming slowly but surely
[01:25:10.800 --> 01:25:14.640]  like North Korea, run by a bunch of inbred psychopaths laughing at us.
[01:25:14.640 --> 01:25:19.360]  Let's go to your phone calls. Huge breaking news coming up at infoawards.com with the
[01:25:19.360 --> 01:25:24.000]  Secret Service and more. Just stay with us. Mario in South Carolina, thanks for holding.
[01:25:24.000 --> 01:25:24.880]  You're on the air, sir.
[01:25:26.160 --> 01:25:33.520]  Yes, Alex Jones. I wanted to call about a upcoming FEMA drill that I saw on the internet on April
[01:25:33.520 --> 01:25:42.240]  27th. If you go to Google, type in Nevada governor 2014 zombie UFO drill, and that'll come up.
[01:25:42.800 --> 01:25:46.480]  No, I know. And it was so shocking. They then said it was a lie when it came out.
[01:25:46.480 --> 01:25:49.520]  But do you know why they do a zombie drill now?
[01:25:50.640 --> 01:25:58.640]  Well, the guy was talking about how coal were in government for zombie is the one that is
[01:25:58.640 --> 01:26:05.040]  on welfare during a financial- That's right. Look, the Marines did all these drills of mowing
[01:26:06.480 --> 01:26:09.520]  minorities down in some of the videos we have in police safety thousand.
[01:26:09.520 --> 01:26:13.520]  They either trained to kill black people mainly, and you can look at the role players they got,
[01:26:13.520 --> 01:26:17.280]  or they trained to kill rednecks and John Deere hats. That's who they're gonna have trouble with.
[01:26:18.480 --> 01:26:22.560]  And for whatever reason, mainly it's John Deere hats, but about a quarter of it is trying to
[01:26:22.560 --> 01:26:26.960]  kill black people. Line them up and shoot them. I didn't really see a lot of Hispanics. I saw some,
[01:26:27.520 --> 01:26:30.560]  but the point is it was just mainly, I've been to so many of these drills, it's either,
[01:26:30.560 --> 01:26:33.440]  okay, we're trying to kill black people or we're trying to kill rednecks.
[01:26:34.240 --> 01:26:37.920]  But yeah, that's it, very astute. And so now they just call it a zombie,
[01:26:38.640 --> 01:26:43.280]  because you're already seen as an animal. So it's part of dehumanization. See, the Nazis
[01:26:43.280 --> 01:26:48.480]  said for seven, eight years, our enemies are rats and bugs in all these newsreels.
[01:26:48.480 --> 01:26:52.240]  Now the LA Times has said about me, to dehumanize. Now they just say you're a
[01:26:52.240 --> 01:26:56.800]  zombie. And all the zombies shows they're on record are meant to condition you and acclimate
[01:26:56.800 --> 01:27:01.680]  you to not care about death and destruction, to build a core of psychopaths that will carry out
[01:27:01.680 --> 01:27:06.800]  the extermination operations. Go ahead. Well, I was just gonna say that this was
[01:27:06.800 --> 01:27:12.080]  listed, it said 100 participants. So I was thinking maybe it was an upcoming false flag,
[01:27:12.080 --> 01:27:15.680]  because they have to do a drill. Because if they get caught, they can blame the-
[01:27:15.680 --> 01:27:18.000]  Oh, yeah, and then they'll just say there wasn't even a drill. They won't
[01:27:18.000 --> 01:27:21.040]  even imagine that it's the newspaper. They'll just say there was no drill.
[01:27:21.040 --> 01:27:23.840]  They'll go, well, his video is zombies. And they'll go, those didn't exist either.
[01:27:23.840 --> 01:27:29.120]  So look, Jones says they're zombies. And he says Cobra Commander runs things,
[01:27:29.120 --> 01:27:34.560]  which is an allegory, but basically it's the same thing. The world is ruled to a great extent by
[01:27:34.560 --> 01:27:38.640]  people that make Cobra Commander look like an angel. But it's the exact tactics you see,
[01:27:38.640 --> 01:27:42.320]  they were teaching little kids the type of dirty tricks they were gonna carry out
[01:27:42.320 --> 01:27:47.120]  as globalist operatives. Exactly, exactly. Also, another thing,
[01:27:48.000 --> 01:27:53.360]  a few years ago during that whole Georgian thing with Russia, I was actually there.
[01:27:53.360 --> 01:28:00.880]  And it was pretty weird because the Russians were falling behind us. And I knew that we actually did
[01:28:00.880 --> 01:28:04.640]  the first attack, but everyone else, they didn't know. And they thought-
[01:28:04.640 --> 01:28:08.960]  Let me stop you and give you the floor then, Mario. For those that don't know, I got fooled that day
[01:28:10.080 --> 01:28:13.280]  cuz I got up kinda late, cuz I think I'd even done coast to coast or something.
[01:28:13.280 --> 01:28:17.120]  But I'd been up to like four in the morning. So my wife goes, get up, it's like nine o'clock.
[01:28:17.120 --> 01:28:21.680]  There's been a big war starting. The Russians have attacked Georgia. And I'm like, yeah, right.
[01:28:21.680 --> 01:28:24.560]  Cuz the Russians don't really ever attack anybody until they get messed with,
[01:28:25.200 --> 01:28:28.960]  or they infiltrate to take over. I'm like, yeah. So I get up and CNN's like,
[01:28:28.960 --> 01:28:32.560]  the Russians have attacked the dastardly. There could be nuclear war.
[01:28:32.560 --> 01:28:38.160]  So I drive in, I go on air at 11 AM. And I say, well, the Russians attacked,
[01:28:38.720 --> 01:28:44.960]  not knowing even naive, back in 2008, how big of liars they are. And yes, it later came out the US
[01:28:44.960 --> 01:28:48.560]  through proxies attacked Russia held areas in South Ossetia and Abkhazia.
[01:28:48.560 --> 01:28:51.200]  You say you were there in the Navy. Tell us about that. I see that on screen.
[01:28:52.240 --> 01:28:56.640]  Yeah, so I was there in the Navy. Not gonna really name the ship, but there's only one
[01:28:56.640 --> 01:29:04.240]  ship in the mid over there. But basically, we responded for a humanitarian call, and we
[01:29:04.240 --> 01:29:10.080]  basically gave the Georgians some supplies. But at the same time, I was talking to a friend that
[01:29:10.080 --> 01:29:15.600]  I met, a girl, being in the Navy and everything. And she was in Russia, and she was explaining to
[01:29:15.600 --> 01:29:21.200]  me the entire situation. And I was like, wow, that doesn't really make too much sense.
[01:29:21.200 --> 01:29:26.560]  Why are we helping out the Georgians when- Now on the ship, did they tell you that Russia had
[01:29:26.560 --> 01:29:29.200]  attacked? Or were they more honest, knowing you'd have the information?
[01:29:30.480 --> 01:29:36.320]  They didn't tell us. That was more high level. But all they told us was to be on watch,
[01:29:37.760 --> 01:29:42.560]  sending information throughout the med and everything. Cuz I was dealing with
[01:29:42.560 --> 01:29:46.560]  communications while on the ship, so they were- Anything else you wanna add on that, sir?
[01:29:46.560 --> 01:29:51.760]  Uh, on that, no. You know, I just wanna let everyone know that-
[01:29:51.760 --> 01:29:54.080]  Well, God bless you, yeah. Thanks for bringing up another zombie drill,
[01:29:54.080 --> 01:29:57.040]  which is another drill for mass extermination of citizens.
[01:29:57.040 --> 01:30:03.760]  We're on the march. The empire's on the run. Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.

[01:34:02.720 --> 01:34:16.400]  The top story up on infowars.com is that the CIA had recruited in Georgia for operations the older
[01:34:16.400 --> 01:34:24.400]  Tamerlan brothers. So that story is red linked up at infowars.com. We know he had a alias to get it
[01:34:24.400 --> 01:34:29.280]  out of the country which the government let him use. That's the big tip-off. We know this has the
[01:34:29.280 --> 01:34:41.120]  classic signs there. Again that is up on infowars.com right now. You add to this that we have the
[01:34:41.120 --> 01:34:47.120]  senator coming out Chambliss. We're going to play that clip here in just a moment. Law enforcement
[01:34:47.120 --> 01:34:53.440]  agency may have had info about Boston bombing in advance. You had the drill did go on and then you
[01:34:53.440 --> 01:35:02.000]  add to the secret service. The secret service did not want Dan Badandi to ask questions and Dan
[01:35:02.000 --> 01:35:07.200]  talked about this and it turns out there was video aired from some of the angles on national
[01:35:07.200 --> 01:35:14.320]  television and those images are about to go up on infowars.com. But I can show TV viewers
[01:35:14.320 --> 01:35:21.200]  the images that I printed off right here from the third press conference where Dan Badandi was able
[01:35:22.160 --> 01:35:29.120]  infowars.com East Coast reporter to get in and ask about the drill and to ask about the history
[01:35:29.120 --> 01:35:33.760]  of government provocateur and groups. Were these guys patsies that work for the government?
[01:35:33.760 --> 01:35:38.000]  Because in almost every other case it's been so you'd be remiss to not ask that and again the
[01:35:38.000 --> 01:35:43.600]  only media to give this any positive coverage was Michael Savage. Paul Watson heard it and told me
[01:35:43.600 --> 01:35:47.920]  about it. I didn't hear it and said of course you want to ask about the drill and now we found new
[01:35:47.920 --> 01:35:52.720]  articles in the Boston Globe admitting a drill but they tried to spin it and a drill a few years
[01:35:52.720 --> 01:35:57.120]  before that. So there was a drill of a bombing right where it happens. Why do you do that?
[01:35:57.120 --> 01:36:02.480]  You want to have black backpacks everywhere. So and again the people with the black backpacks
[01:36:02.480 --> 01:36:06.480]  they're not involved. They're part of the drill with their black backpacks, contractors,
[01:36:06.480 --> 01:36:11.680]  National Guard, Navy Seals, you name it. And then that way no one can catch the real bomb
[01:36:11.680 --> 01:36:15.440]  when it gets left. And there's so many people with backpacks it gets confusing.
[01:36:15.440 --> 01:36:18.960]  And then you can blame the patsies which are your intelligence ops
[01:36:18.960 --> 01:36:23.920]  who believe they or who are your assets who believe they're taking part in a drill.
[01:36:25.040 --> 01:36:28.880]  Then the mother says they call them up threaten them to make them go on the run.
[01:36:28.880 --> 01:36:34.320]  They were both hanging out going to parties night before talking about how weird the bombing was and
[01:36:34.320 --> 01:36:39.600]  then magically they supposedly run. We don't know if any of that's true. Then he climbs out of the
[01:36:39.600 --> 01:36:44.080]  boat not bleeding from the neck. Next he's almost dead with his neck being cut open.
[01:36:44.080 --> 01:36:48.880]  And now they have shown he'll never get a free trial of the younger brother.
[01:36:48.880 --> 01:36:52.000]  They're in the news saying, Boston Globe witnesses,
[01:36:52.000 --> 01:37:01.680]  the sources say he admitted to the bombings. Admits to setting bombs with brother sources
[01:37:01.680 --> 01:37:06.560]  say also admits he and brother Tamerlan were behind killing of MIT officer.
[01:37:07.520 --> 01:37:12.080]  So there you go. It's all open and shut, ladies and gentlemen. And it's a conspiracy there. Yeah,
[01:37:12.080 --> 01:37:19.120]  he was at CIA workshops. Yeah, he had covers. Yeah, there was a drill. Yeah, the senator says
[01:37:19.120 --> 01:37:23.840]  it looks like it was prior knowledge and they stood down. Yeah, everything Alex Jones predicted.
[01:37:23.840 --> 01:37:29.840]  And folks, why did I predict it? Let's punch up in fallwars.com. This is from April 19th.
[01:37:31.040 --> 01:37:37.520]  I said Saturday, it was actually Friday night. I saw the Saturday morning, Boston bombers role of
[01:37:37.520 --> 01:37:42.800]  CIA in Chechen and terror. And he goes through and list the very State Department groups in
[01:37:42.800 --> 01:37:51.680]  Georgetown. And the very, very groups connected and how they have funded these groups and how
[01:37:51.680 --> 01:37:55.920]  they had an alias. And all of that later came out. The mother said they were all over them
[01:37:55.920 --> 01:38:00.560]  five years before. And the mother said they visited him two and a half years ago, which
[01:38:00.560 --> 01:38:05.520]  was confirmed. Mothers were telling the truth because the Russians blew their cover.
[01:38:05.520 --> 01:38:09.920]  That's how the Russians would do it, or the US would do it. Hey, who is this you're having
[01:38:09.920 --> 01:38:17.440]  with an alias go back and forth? He worked for you, is he a terrorist? And by the way,
[01:38:17.440 --> 01:38:24.640]  it's seasoned people who've run black ops like Steve Pacinek saying it's an inside job.
[01:38:24.640 --> 01:38:28.880]  It's seasoned people like Joel Scowles and concurrent with my analysis, okay?
[01:38:28.880 --> 01:38:32.480]  You think it's fun to go up against these people? I mean, even if you don't believe
[01:38:32.480 --> 01:38:36.720]  it's an inside job, there's no history of that. You wanna say USA take my rights and you're a fool.
[01:38:36.720 --> 01:38:43.040]  Even if you're a fool, do you know the government goes after people that stand up to them? Cuz
[01:38:43.040 --> 01:38:49.200]  they're bullies. So you think I enjoy doing this. They call me a maniac. They call me a madman.
[01:38:49.200 --> 01:38:54.080]  They call me spooky. They call me dangerous. They call me a fascist. Folks, I'm really just a Texan.
[01:38:55.200 --> 01:38:58.480]  And I'll be honest with you, your ancestors were tough and they stood up.
[01:38:58.480 --> 01:39:01.920]  I'll guarantee if you research them, my ancestors were just as tough or tougher.
[01:39:01.920 --> 01:39:07.280]  And they didn't bow to King George. They didn't bow to Santa Ana. And you know what? A lot of
[01:39:07.280 --> 01:39:11.120]  them didn't survive, but the idea went on. And that's just in my blood. I am not a slave.
[01:39:11.680 --> 01:39:16.000]  And I'm not gonna be ruled by a bunch of murdering criminals that have put Libya and Syria under
[01:39:16.000 --> 01:39:20.960]  Al-Qaeda to line Christians up and chop their heads off while telling me I gotta give my rights
[01:39:20.960 --> 01:39:28.320]  up or Al-Qaeda will get me when they run them. And by the way, they're gonna take everything,
[01:39:28.320 --> 01:39:31.120]  folks. This is a really nasty group. Now I'm gonna shut up.
[01:39:31.120 --> 01:39:34.720]  He's gonna have them on for about five minutes. Then we're gonna go to your phone calls,
[01:39:34.720 --> 01:39:40.560]  Liz and Nick and Jordan and Derek and Jenny. We're gonna get to all of you here in just a moment.
[01:39:42.240 --> 01:39:46.880]  But history's happening here. We're the only ones at infoawars.com on the trail.
[01:39:47.600 --> 01:39:56.080]  I have put my name, my family, most importantly, my treasure, everything on this because I know
[01:39:56.080 --> 01:40:01.200]  what I'm talking about. I mean, it isn't hard when the globalists have done this over and over again.
[01:40:01.200 --> 01:40:06.640]  It's like, I hate to use gross analogy, it's like walking through a field with cows in it.
[01:40:06.640 --> 01:40:10.240]  And there's a big steaming pile of cow manure right there. And I go, hey, watch out, that's cow
[01:40:10.240 --> 01:40:16.000]  manure. And some city slicker goes, really? I think it's a big chocolate cake. And I'm like,
[01:40:16.000 --> 01:40:20.320]  no, that's cow manure. I promise cows, you eat grass, they got three stomachs, they crap that out.
[01:40:20.320 --> 01:40:23.760]  They're like, shut up conspiracy theorists. And they sit down with a spoon and start eating it.
[01:40:23.760 --> 01:40:27.440]  And you're like, hey, does that really taste good? They're like, yeah, it's chocolate, like I said.
[01:40:28.640 --> 01:40:31.680]  And you're going, no, no, man, this is tyranny. You don't wanna eat that.
[01:40:31.680 --> 01:40:35.040]  You don't wanna go down this road. The founders said it was cow manure. They're like, no,
[01:40:35.040 --> 01:40:38.800]  I say it's chocolate cake. And that's what Americans are doing to go along with this.
[01:40:38.800 --> 01:40:43.040]  I say everybody having to put their hands up and come out of their houses is chocolate cake.
[01:40:43.040 --> 01:40:46.000]  I'm saying the government spying on us without warrants is chocolate cake.
[01:40:46.000 --> 01:40:49.600]  I'm saying drones targeting us domestically is a good thing. It's chocolate cake.
[01:40:49.600 --> 01:40:53.760]  Let me tell you why a lot of people kind of halfway sell out to all this,
[01:40:53.760 --> 01:40:58.080]  like you've been seeing lately. God love them. It's because they're scared, ladies and gentlemen,
[01:40:58.080 --> 01:41:01.920]  and their wives at home saying, man, this is dangerous. And all the ladies from the
[01:41:01.920 --> 01:41:05.600]  Senate are saying we better watch it and play ball, honey, and work on the inside
[01:41:05.600 --> 01:41:09.840]  and fix things that way. I mean, I don't like that phone call I got.
[01:41:09.840 --> 01:41:19.920]  Let me tell you, you better look in your kid's eyes long and hard,
[01:41:19.920 --> 01:41:22.320]  cuz I'll tell you one thing that's for certain. You go along with this,
[01:41:22.320 --> 01:41:29.120]  you can kiss their butts goodbye. You got all these senators and media people in their fancy
[01:41:29.120 --> 01:41:35.920]  suits up there on egomaniac trips. And if you're not dedicated to this for liberty
[01:41:35.920 --> 01:41:40.560]  and for freedom and justice and tuning into being a good person and the universe,
[01:41:41.120 --> 01:41:43.760]  then you are going to end up kneeling to this evil.
[01:41:44.880 --> 01:41:48.960]  You're going to end up compromising with it. You're going to end up selling out to it.
[01:41:50.000 --> 01:41:54.880]  And you can't sell out to death, folks. There's no compromising with the New World Order.
[01:41:56.160 --> 01:42:01.760]  I wanna bring you now Dan Badandi, M4 Wars reporter, someone people admire for his courage.
[01:42:01.760 --> 01:42:05.680]  People ask, why did I hire Dan Badandi? Because if you go back to where I was first on
[01:42:05.680 --> 01:42:09.760]  air 18 years ago, I'd stutter and stammer sometimes, I still do it. I would get overly
[01:42:09.760 --> 01:42:17.440]  excited. Does he look like one of the anchors on Fox News? No, he doesn't. Do I? No, I don't.
[01:42:18.400 --> 01:42:23.120]  But he's a real guy and has a fighting spirit, and that's why he's a reporter from fullwars.com.
[01:42:23.120 --> 01:42:26.720]  And he did something that none of those other cowards would do. They won't even look at photos.
[01:42:26.720 --> 01:42:30.160]  Dan's like, I have photos of the other people that they don't want you to see.
[01:42:30.160 --> 01:42:33.920]  The Secret Service comes over, let's show the images, and gets in his face and threatens him.
[01:42:33.920 --> 01:42:38.640]  And now, they wouldn't say who they were last week, he thought they were FBI.
[01:42:39.680 --> 01:42:44.320]  Now, people pointed out, notice this is Secret Service on record with Obama.
[01:42:44.320 --> 01:42:49.440]  So Obama sent guys to bug their eyes out and threaten Dan Badandi, and there he is standing
[01:42:49.440 --> 01:42:53.680]  up to him. Look at him, that's what the Globals are doing to all of America. They're coming up,
[01:42:53.680 --> 01:42:57.600]  get in your face, staring at you, trying to look evil, trying to look tough,
[01:42:57.600 --> 01:43:01.280]  show that you'll bend over so foreign banks can implode the country and take over.
[01:43:01.280 --> 01:43:05.760]  All because they feel like they belong. Why don't you, Secret Service, be like the Secret Service
[01:43:05.760 --> 01:43:10.960]  agent Bongino, who was sitting there at a meeting and he thought it was like a Mao Tse Tung meeting.
[01:43:10.960 --> 01:43:15.120]  As Obama was talking about how collectivism is good, and how you didn't build that, and how
[01:43:15.120 --> 01:43:19.200]  children must tell their parents what to do. He recognized he was in a globalist,
[01:43:19.200 --> 01:43:26.640]  collectivist, hardcore authoritarian meeting. And I guess, Don Salazar now has his article up,
[01:43:26.640 --> 01:43:30.000]  great job to a Don. I just said, blurb it, he did a whole article with the photos.
[01:43:30.000 --> 01:43:37.760]  Now up at Infowars.com, we need to red link that as well. And I've had Secret Service come up to
[01:43:37.760 --> 01:43:40.880]  me, I'm not saying they're all bad, I know a lot of them are listeners, I've run into them since.
[01:43:40.880 --> 01:43:44.320]  But the guys they send are the ones that are evil. The ones that'll do what they're told,
[01:43:44.320 --> 01:43:47.280]  the ones that get off of being a bully and trying to scare people. I'd be embarrassed trying to
[01:43:47.280 --> 01:43:50.320]  scare somebody who wasn't asking for it. And then I wouldn't try to scare them, I'd try to
[01:43:50.320 --> 01:43:56.240]  climb all over who was trying to hurt an innocent person. Try to get them off of what was happening.
[01:43:56.240 --> 01:44:02.080]  I had Secret Service try stuff like this with me when I tried to just go down and report on the
[01:44:02.080 --> 01:44:07.840]  2000 election results. They think this is Communist China, they think it's North Korea.
[01:44:07.840 --> 01:44:12.240]  And you know what, if we let them act like that, it is. Dan Badandi, he wrote a many out there,
[01:44:12.240 --> 01:44:19.600]  Infowars.com reporter, great job, my friend. He's even got family, because he's right there by
[01:44:19.600 --> 01:44:23.680]  Boston. And we're not gonna say their names, turning their back on him over this, cuz they
[01:44:23.680 --> 01:44:28.560]  can't handle the peer pressure. They can't handle the fact to see their family member having courage.
[01:44:28.560 --> 01:44:33.040]  They should be toasting him, they should be carrying him on their shoulders, but instead
[01:44:33.040 --> 01:44:38.000]  they spit on him. And here he is, ladies and gentlemen, in a world of cowards,
[01:44:38.000 --> 01:44:42.640]  being a man of courage is a revolutionary act. And Dan Badandi joins us. Dan, recapping,
[01:44:42.640 --> 01:44:45.760]  as you mentioned this as a footnote, what did they say to you? What did they do to you?
[01:44:45.760 --> 01:44:50.960]  What did you say back to them? And now to know that they didn't want you asking those questions.
[01:44:50.960 --> 01:44:56.080]  Here's the big issue. So they sent Secret Service of Obama, his Interpreterian Guard,
[01:44:56.960 --> 01:45:03.360]  of literal Gestapo, of SS. SS was Hitler's Interguard, the Praetorian Royal Guard,
[01:45:04.160 --> 01:45:07.040]  sent to stand in front of you and try to shut you down in America,
[01:45:07.040 --> 01:45:10.160]  because you wanted to hand out pictures of the contractors. Go ahead.
[01:45:10.160 --> 01:45:16.400]  Well, when I got there, I knew he was some kind of agent. I wasn't sure, I said he was the FBI,
[01:45:16.400 --> 01:45:22.080]  but obviously he's the Secret Service. But when I sat down, he wanted to sit behind me.
[01:45:22.080 --> 01:45:25.440]  I heard him argue with the guy behind me, he had to sit there, his stuff was there,
[01:45:25.440 --> 01:45:30.320]  whatever the case. But he kept peeking over my shoulder every time I sent a text message,
[01:45:30.320 --> 01:45:34.800]  every time I got a phone call, and when I was talking to my camera guy and my partner there.
[01:45:34.800 --> 01:45:38.640]  And I knew this guy wasn't a reporter, he was dressed as a reporter. It's like,
[01:45:38.640 --> 01:45:43.040]  this guy's not no reporter, and he's gonna give me your problem. So when I get up to
[01:45:43.040 --> 01:45:46.400]  just the people, I had these pictures right here, the very pictures I showed.
[01:45:46.400 --> 01:45:50.640]  He jumps up with his clipboard, blocking the cameras, trying to anyway,
[01:45:50.640 --> 01:45:54.400]  trying to block these photos. They were hell-bent, these pictures wouldn't be showed.
[01:45:54.400 --> 01:45:59.680]  Now before I went on here, he mentioned, when my friend arrives, he gave me these photographs there.
[01:46:00.320 --> 01:46:06.240]  And I heard him yell to some other guy, they got pictures. They ran in the back of the hallway and
[01:46:06.240 --> 01:46:10.640]  said they got pictures. The woman comes out, the coordinator, and she says to the press,
[01:46:10.640 --> 01:46:14.240]  excuse me, everybody, we're gonna delay the meeting in about five minutes.
[01:46:14.240 --> 01:46:18.000]  We're gonna get stuff together. What they were doing is they were trying to come up with a story.
[01:46:18.000 --> 01:46:23.280]  And that's why they came out right away, Alex, and they said, do not go to anybody else's pictures,
[01:46:23.280 --> 01:46:27.600]  but ours. Don't look anywhere else but our pictures. And no other picture is credible.
[01:46:27.600 --> 01:46:32.080]  And these pictures here, these very pictures, I showed to the press anyway. I got bombarded by
[01:46:32.080 --> 01:46:37.280]  agents, FBI agents and a Secret Service guy. But I stood up to him. I said, I'm not afraid of you
[01:46:37.280 --> 01:46:42.240]  people. And I stood right up to him cuz I'm not, I have no fear of these people cuz I have a strong
[01:46:42.240 --> 01:46:48.880]  faith in God. But these pictures here were the nuclear bomb of information. Because I had press
[01:46:48.880 --> 01:46:53.520]  swarming me when, of course, the federal agents backed off. And I showed those pictures. I said,
[01:46:53.520 --> 01:46:58.320]  these pictures could be seen on infowars.com, and people want to download these pictures.
[01:46:58.320 --> 01:47:03.280]  And that guy behind me, I knew he was up to no good. I knew he was up to something.
[01:47:03.280 --> 01:47:06.880]  And even my cameraman mentioned, watch that guy behind you, because he was hell-bent on
[01:47:06.880 --> 01:47:15.120]  sitting behind me. We should also give credit to the camera guy if he wants to be public.
[01:47:18.000 --> 01:47:22.320]  Kevin LaPrade and Nick M, which was my other partner, was holding the microphone for me.
[01:47:23.200 --> 01:47:27.920]  Kevin LaPrade and Nick M, they're good friends of mine. They're both activist groups. I forgot
[01:47:27.920 --> 01:47:31.920]  the group he belongs to. But anyway, it's- Well, Dan, listen, here's the bottom line.
[01:47:31.920 --> 01:47:36.560]  Well, they acted totally suspicious about the other photos, the other people.
[01:47:37.600 --> 01:47:42.400]  One of the Saudis has now ended up dead in a river. And that may have happened before.
[01:47:42.400 --> 01:47:46.880]  Who knows? It may not be related, but I predicted that the people that end up in the river actually
[01:47:46.880 --> 01:47:50.640]  said that over and over again, cuz I've seen it before. I hope people realize what we're
[01:47:50.640 --> 01:47:54.400]  doing here. I mean, I'm not asking people to go, you've got so much courage. You're so great.
[01:47:54.400 --> 01:48:00.720]  But we literally are standing directly up to the beast. And now a senator has come out and said,
[01:48:00.720 --> 01:48:04.160]  looks like they had prior knowledge and stood down. We know that there was a drill. That's
[01:48:04.160 --> 01:48:10.800]  now been confirmed. Now it's come out that the older brother, Tamerlan, was CIA. Of course he
[01:48:10.800 --> 01:48:16.480]  was. He was allowed to go in and out with fake name. I mean, that stuff doesn't work unless they
[01:48:16.480 --> 01:48:22.400]  want it to work. And now he's hooked in with Zbigniew Brzezinski, who runs the operations
[01:48:22.400 --> 01:48:29.040]  to destabilize Russia. Unbelievable. And I just wanna say one thing, too, if I could.
[01:48:29.040 --> 01:48:34.320]  I mean, everybody's giving me these compliments. My credit, all that stuff goes to God. Glory to
[01:48:34.320 --> 01:48:40.080]  God, not me. And I wanna say one thing. I'm from the smallest town and the smallest state in the
[01:48:40.080 --> 01:48:44.480]  country, literally. My town is one square mile to Central Falls and we're from Rhode Island,
[01:48:44.480 --> 01:48:49.680]  which is a small state. So if one man can stand up against the global elite and make a difference,
[01:48:49.680 --> 01:48:54.400]  you can too. Alex says all the time, you are the resistance. And it doesn't matter who you are.
[01:48:54.400 --> 01:48:57.360]  I'm not a great speaker. I don't have a pretty face. I don't like those,
[01:48:57.360 --> 01:49:00.880]  you know, the reporters on CNN that read from teleprompters.
[01:49:00.880 --> 01:49:03.440]  You know what I mean? And I expose that to when I pull home the sidewalk.
[01:49:03.440 --> 01:49:08.560]  You're a man who loves liberty and loves your family. You have an instinct to not be a slave.
[01:49:10.000 --> 01:49:12.880]  And it's that instinct, Dan, that has done everything good in the world.
[01:49:14.000 --> 01:49:18.640]  It's that instinct that has created civilization is not bending over to bullies.
[01:49:20.560 --> 01:49:24.400]  Absolutely, and I'd rather die on my feet than live on my knees, like George Washington said.
[01:49:24.400 --> 01:49:28.320]  Well, tell us the kind of stuff, because I remember you were off
[01:49:28.320 --> 01:49:29.920]  here saying they were really getting in your face.
[01:49:29.920 --> 01:49:32.720]  What did Obama's personal Secret Service people say to you?
[01:49:34.400 --> 01:49:38.320]  Well, when I was trying to ask the questions, he was behind me heckling me. Shut up, shut up,
[01:49:38.320 --> 01:49:42.880]  and you can't even tell it's my first amendment back the hell off. And I was right, you know,
[01:49:42.880 --> 01:49:45.760]  because these people are very rude. He was out there like shut me down.
[01:49:45.760 --> 01:49:48.720]  But what about the photos where he's in your face, right up in your space,
[01:49:48.720 --> 01:49:50.240]  and you point your finger back in his face?
[01:49:50.240 --> 01:49:56.800]  Oh, yeah, he jumps right up here because he was expecting that. He jumps up and gets his
[01:49:56.800 --> 01:50:01.920]  clipboard and he's trying to block the photos from the camera, these very photos, yeah.
[01:50:02.480 --> 01:50:07.120]  And of course, I put them with two hands and can't block both. And he was like,
[01:50:07.120 --> 01:50:11.280]  tell me, sit down, shut up, blah, blah, blah. That's what they do now, they protect the lie.
[01:50:11.920 --> 01:50:17.120]  They protect the fraud. They protect Kim Jong Un. They protect the dictator.
[01:50:17.120 --> 01:50:20.720]  And that's just gonna be infuriated. I mean, these people think they're
[01:50:20.720 --> 01:50:25.040]  intimidating me. And I'm not no superhero, I'm not. I'm just sick of it, like you are,
[01:50:25.040 --> 01:50:29.760]  Alex. I'm sick of it. And you know what? I know my life's at stake and yours as well.
[01:50:29.760 --> 01:50:34.640]  And I know it's all involved here, but I don't care. My founding fathers, your founding fathers,
[01:50:35.200 --> 01:50:38.880]  our founding fathers, they made that sacrifice for us. So you know what?
[01:50:38.880 --> 01:50:42.480]  It's our trying to make the sacrifice for our kids and our grandkids someday.
[01:50:42.480 --> 01:50:44.240]  And that's why I'm not afraid because-
[01:50:44.240 --> 01:50:47.440]  That's right, stay there and then I'll come back with calls, stay there. Absolutely,
[01:50:47.440 --> 01:50:51.520]  they think we're beat. They think it's over. They think they can gut the whole country,
[01:50:51.520 --> 01:50:56.080]  suck us dry, shut down our energy systems. You know the first thing you bomb?
[01:50:56.080 --> 01:51:00.560]  You bomb power plants, they're shutting them down. I mean, we are being shut down right now.
[01:51:00.560 --> 01:51:04.160]  We are being reeducated. But you know what? America's waking up.
[01:51:04.160 --> 01:51:17.120]  We're not done yet, you globalist murdering scum.
[01:51:34.320 --> 01:51:37.360]  on the web right now, yourbugoutplan.com.
[01:51:37.360 --> 01:51:41.600]  Bills in front of Congress right now could take away your right to keep and bear arms.
[01:51:41.600 --> 01:51:45.840]  If Obama has his way, all guns will be either banned, restricted or confiscated,
[01:51:45.840 --> 01:51:50.160]  possibly by executive order. The best way to keep your guns is to hide them.
[01:51:50.160 --> 01:51:55.280]  What Obama can't find, Obama can't take away. You can protect your guns from any threat.

[01:52:07.600 --> 01:52:11.840]  Hello, this is Ty Bollinger, author of the best selling book, Cancer Step Outside the Box.
[01:52:12.400 --> 01:52:14.640]  I want you to know some very important information.
[01:52:15.280 --> 01:52:20.880]  In 1985, President Ronald Reagan requested that carnivora be sent directly to the White House
[01:52:20.880 --> 01:52:23.920]  at a time when only the president could obtain this world class healer.
[01:52:24.480 --> 01:52:30.000]  Now, 27 years later, carnivore capsules are used around the world to keep people healthy.
[01:52:30.000 --> 01:52:34.720]  Now you can protect yourself and your loved ones in this age of superbugs with 17
[01:52:34.720 --> 01:52:39.200]  naturally occurring compounds that instinctively respond to abnormal cells only
[01:52:39.200 --> 01:52:42.720]  without harming a single normal cell. If you want to stay healthy,
[01:52:42.720 --> 01:52:45.840]  now's your chance to literally wake up your critical immune cells
[01:52:45.840 --> 01:52:48.480]  to attack harmful invaders that don't belong in your body.
[01:52:48.480 --> 01:53:00.320]  Call 1-866-VenusFly or order from carnivora.com. That's C-A-R-N-I-V-O-R-A.com. That's 1-866-836-8735
[01:53:00.320 --> 01:53:06.560]  1-866-VenusFly or visit carnivora.com. Protect your immune system. It's the only one you've got.
[01:53:07.120 --> 01:53:11.200]  In the last two years alone, the US has seen huge losses to our food supply.
[01:53:11.200 --> 01:53:16.880]  In 2011, storms and floods raged across the US, costing us 20 billion in lost crops alone.
[01:53:16.880 --> 01:53:20.880]  In 2012, we saw the largest drought in the country in more than 50 years.
[01:53:20.880 --> 01:53:24.800]  You may think out of sight, out of mind, and so you don't think you will be affected.
[01:53:24.800 --> 01:53:29.840]  The fact is you are. We all are. Food shortages drive prices up for everyone.
[01:53:29.840 --> 01:53:34.080]  You might not be able to control mother nature, but you can control your food prices
[01:53:34.080 --> 01:53:38.320]  by freezing the cost and availability of your food supply with e Foods Direct.
[01:53:38.320 --> 01:53:43.120]  Be prepared before you need it with nutrient-dense food you can store for up to 25 years.
[01:53:43.120 --> 01:53:45.520]  You can hope for the best, but hope won't feed you.
[01:53:45.520 --> 01:53:47.920]  Do what I've done and get your own supply of the best,
[01:53:47.920 --> 01:53:50.080]  durable foods out there from e Foods Direct.

[01:54:19.600 --> 01:54:21.760]  We're back live. One more segment with Badandi.
[01:54:21.760 --> 01:54:27.600]  Then I'm going to push our next guest back to about 15 after so I can get to these calls.
[01:54:27.600 --> 01:54:29.280]  And we'll get an update from Lindsey Williams.
[01:54:29.280 --> 01:54:35.520]  Look, I just want to say this, I kind of get wound up to not even have courage to do this,
[01:54:35.520 --> 01:54:38.160]  but I mean, when I look at this evidence and then do what I do,
[01:54:38.160 --> 01:54:41.600]  you automatically get aggressive because you know you're fighting bad people.
[01:54:42.880 --> 01:54:45.200]  But I want to be very, very crystal clear here.
[01:54:45.200 --> 01:54:49.920]  The police, most of the FBI, most of the Secret Service are not involved in this.
[01:54:49.920 --> 01:54:52.880]  And they really believe they're good guys working for a good system.
[01:54:52.880 --> 01:54:57.840]  To use the movie analogy, just like Tom Cruise thinks he's working for the good guys in oblivion,
[01:54:57.840 --> 01:55:02.800]  but he finds out otherwise. And that's what history has shown. Most German soldiers,
[01:55:02.800 --> 01:55:09.840]  including SS, really thought they were doing good work. And they really believe
[01:55:09.840 --> 01:55:14.000]  these guys acted alone. They're not going to look at them being CIA, even if it's admitted,
[01:55:14.000 --> 01:55:19.600]  they don't want to look at that. Because they're all caught up in the pageantry and the funerals
[01:55:19.600 --> 01:55:25.120]  and they're the heroes and all this stuff. And they attach all this tyranny, martial law,
[01:55:25.120 --> 01:55:33.680]  to the new USA, USA. This is all a program. You learn how it looks, then you go, man,
[01:55:33.680 --> 01:55:37.120]  that looks like the past stuff. And sure enough, okay, we'll see if there's a drill,
[01:55:37.120 --> 01:55:39.520]  we'll see if there was prior knowledge, we'll see if there's a stand down.
[01:55:39.520 --> 01:55:44.800]  We'll see if they were sent overseas in CIA training for Brzezinski groups,
[01:55:44.800 --> 01:55:49.760]  and that it's public, enrolled in Brzezinski groups with the terror groups.
[01:55:49.760 --> 01:56:00.720]  I mean, it's so painful. I wish they were real terrorists every day. I don't want to come up here
[01:56:00.720 --> 01:56:05.520]  and say things that freak people out and are unpopular, but I have a responsibility to do it.
[01:56:06.080 --> 01:56:10.480]  And of course, now you notice it's coming out, so we become even more popular.
[01:56:10.480 --> 01:56:14.960]  But that's not even my goal. I mean, getting more popular, I'd rather the New World Order subside,
[01:56:14.960 --> 01:56:20.400]  because believe me, I don't want to die. I don't want them to kill me or go after my family.
[01:56:20.400 --> 01:56:26.080]  But you know what? These people are so bad, it's got to be done. I'll be honest with you,
[01:56:26.080 --> 01:56:29.600]  if they were just, as I've said a thousand times, if they were boss hog corrupt,
[01:56:29.600 --> 01:56:33.280]  they just wanted to steal stuff and run things. And I could argue, well,
[01:56:33.280 --> 01:56:37.440]  at least it'll trickle down to the economy. I'd still resist them, but I'm not going to do it.
[01:56:37.440 --> 01:56:41.360]  Well, at least it'll trickle down to the economy. I'd still resist them, but I wouldn't just,
[01:56:41.360 --> 01:56:47.600]  110%, study how to resist them historically using the truth and try to hurt them as bad as I could.
[01:56:47.600 --> 01:56:52.000]  I mean, I really am trying to get in their business. And they kill people that do that.
[01:56:52.640 --> 01:56:56.640]  But they haven't killed me because they go, you kill that guy, it'll make everybody listen to
[01:56:56.640 --> 01:57:00.400]  me even more. They're like, it doesn't matter, I want to kill him. And there may be a faction
[01:57:00.400 --> 01:57:06.160]  that does that. Just know I chose that path because that's God's path. Whatever God wants,
[01:57:06.160 --> 01:57:09.840]  it's in God's hands. They can't kill me if God doesn't want that.
[01:57:09.840 --> 01:57:14.160]  But I'm telling you, everybody should do what Dan Badandi did. Everybody listening and watching
[01:57:14.160 --> 01:57:18.080]  should go out with simple questions at press conferences, call it your own local news site,
[01:57:18.080 --> 01:57:22.400]  create your own site, and just go calmly in a suit and ask questions. You will bring them down
[01:57:22.400 --> 01:57:26.480]  just asking questions. They were scared to death of one man talking about a drill
[01:57:26.480 --> 01:57:27.840]  that was in the Boston Globe.
[01:57:27.840 --> 01:57:36.480]  The only reason they're powerful is because you're scared of them. And they are dangerous
[01:57:36.480 --> 01:57:41.680]  now, they are powerful. But we're powerful too. And the God that's in us is a lot stronger than
[01:57:41.680 --> 01:57:48.560]  the God that's in them. They're the God of this world. I serve the God of the universe,
[01:57:49.440 --> 01:57:55.360]  not this little world. Real fast, Badandi, you got one minute to finish up any points.
[01:57:55.360 --> 01:58:01.600]  Real quick, I want to give credit to the Free American Patriots movement. The guys helped me
[01:58:01.600 --> 01:58:06.720]  out a lot. They gave me the pictures. They were great. And I just want to say again, man, I mean,
[01:58:07.440 --> 01:58:11.600]  my family, my whole girlfriend's family disowned me. I'm barred from my girlfriend's house.
[01:58:11.600 --> 01:58:16.960]  My girlfriend's standing against the family and all that. But my life is a miserable hell. I got
[01:58:16.960 --> 01:58:22.720]  half my family that wants to disown me because of what I did. And the thing is, I don't even
[01:58:22.720 --> 01:58:28.000]  care about that because I care about my kids future care about everybody. Absolutely. Hey,
[01:58:28.000 --> 01:58:32.640]  Mark Twain in the beginning of Patriot is a scarce man hated and feared. But in time when
[01:58:32.640 --> 01:58:36.640]  his cause succeeds, the timid join him because then it costs nothing to be a patriot. Dan,
[01:58:36.640 --> 01:58:42.240]  anything else? I'm just want to say get out there, people, cameras,
[01:58:42.240 --> 01:58:46.240]  you have to ask real questions and do not be afraid. Do not be afraid. God bless you.

[02:00:29.520 --> 02:00:32.720]  There are many strengths that flow through the veins of men and women.
[02:00:32.720 --> 02:00:38.160]  But physical strength is not even the most important. It's always been the moral courage
[02:00:38.160 --> 02:00:44.480]  to do what's right. And that is the courage that we lack. We become lazy. We believe what
[02:00:44.480 --> 02:00:48.080]  the establishment says. Or even if we know they're lying, we say, well, what can you change?
[02:00:48.080 --> 02:00:52.320]  Well, nothing if you lay down. Let's go to your phone calls here. Big new breaking news
[02:00:52.320 --> 02:00:57.200]  coming up in the next segment on this Wednesday edition. Let's go ahead and talk to Liz in
[02:00:57.200 --> 02:00:59.920]  California. You're on the air, Liz. Thanks for holding.
[02:00:59.920 --> 02:01:04.800]  Hi, Alex. Thanks for taking my call. This call's about that kid that was wearing the t-shirt
[02:01:05.360 --> 02:01:10.000]  protecting the Second Amendment right. Yeah, I know it was an NRA milk toast t-shirt with
[02:01:10.000 --> 02:01:14.400]  an American eagle on it. Eighth grader suspended over t-shirt, returns to school. Guys, document
[02:01:14.400 --> 02:01:20.640]  cam. Go ahead, ma'am. Okay, here's my idea. I think just like how the Tea Party organized,
[02:01:20.640 --> 02:01:28.720]  there should be an organization one day for all young patriots and Christian people to
[02:01:28.720 --> 02:01:38.400]  say that they should all wear t-shirts that say something like, in God we trust or protect
[02:01:38.400 --> 02:01:43.040]  our Constitution. Absolutely, because the separation of church and state means the government
[02:01:43.040 --> 02:01:47.920]  can't be involved in your religion. Not that you're a member of the state and can't wear a
[02:01:47.920 --> 02:01:53.680]  shirt saying I love Jesus at the mall or at a public school. They cannot bar you from doing
[02:01:53.680 --> 02:01:58.560]  that. It's just a total lie. Just like you can wear NRA t-shirts if you want. I think we
[02:01:58.560 --> 02:02:03.120]  should organize some school, maybe in Austin we have so many listeners, where maybe 100 children
[02:02:03.120 --> 02:02:08.320]  wear a shirt saying I defend the Second Amendment and watch the authoritarians throw them out.
[02:02:08.320 --> 02:02:13.040]  The idea of even a civil rights group isn't allowed. You see what tyranny that is?
[02:02:14.080 --> 02:02:20.880]  Yeah, and I think that they should be organized all through every state, every state,
[02:02:20.880 --> 02:02:26.480]  every school. And let's see how the left teachers and principals react to that.
[02:02:26.480 --> 02:02:28.800]  And what kind of reaction we get.
[02:02:30.800 --> 02:02:34.960]  Listen, it's a culture war. That's why they win as they know to never stop. We beat them,
[02:02:34.960 --> 02:02:38.800]  but then we quit. They keep overrunning us. They always want more and more and more and more.
[02:02:38.800 --> 02:02:44.560]  When we fight, we always win. So we have to drive them out. I mean, listen, they're saying kids,
[02:02:44.560 --> 02:02:48.240]  and again, they want a culture war. It's a class civilization. They play both sides.
[02:02:48.240 --> 02:02:52.560]  They have tried to program Hispanics that communism is what rebels against tyranny,
[02:02:52.560 --> 02:02:56.640]  that anti-gun is good. Why wouldn't Hispanics wanna be capitalists and all the wealth that
[02:02:56.640 --> 02:03:00.560]  comes from it and be able to own guns? Well, most of them do. But they then say,
[02:03:00.560 --> 02:03:06.000]  oh, kids can't wear American flags because it makes the Mexican kids mad.
[02:03:06.000 --> 02:03:10.800]  And it turned out it was Hispanic kids mainly. I think eight kids suspended six said,
[02:03:10.800 --> 02:03:17.840]  you saw them on the news, they were Hispanic. And one of them just wore an old Navy shirt,
[02:03:17.840 --> 02:03:22.720]  I think it was, or American apparel, I forget. He was on the news. And then they said you can't
[02:03:22.720 --> 02:03:28.080]  be here one week. So they came back wearing shirts saying, I'm sick of this. This is America.
[02:03:28.080 --> 02:03:35.920]  I wanna be an American, okay? It's like I've got German and French and Scots and Irish and English
[02:03:35.920 --> 02:03:44.400]  and all these other backgrounds. I don't call myself a Alsatian. I don't call myself a Scot.
[02:03:44.400 --> 02:03:50.720]  I don't call myself a Welsh person. I'm probably more Welsh than anything else.
[02:03:52.000 --> 02:04:00.160]  I've seen people named Jones from England. I met people who are Welsh from Wales.
[02:04:00.160 --> 02:04:08.000]  But the point is, is that it's amazing that they've engaged in this divide and conquer.
[02:04:08.000 --> 02:04:13.280]  And in America, that's not liberalism that you can't wear an American flag shirt. That is crazy
[02:04:13.280 --> 02:04:18.480]  authoritarians who wanna totally dominate you. And that's a reeducation camp. Go ahead.
[02:04:18.480 --> 02:04:24.960]  Well, that's why I think we need to organize and have all these young patriots wear t-shirts on the
[02:04:24.960 --> 02:04:30.000]  same day. I mean, Muslim people of Muslim faith can wear their burkas to school.
[02:04:30.000 --> 02:04:33.760]  Oh, listen, listen, I heard Mantell say this a month ago when I was on a show.
[02:04:33.760 --> 02:04:39.680]  And I believed him, but I went and looked it up. The Saudi Arabians are allowed to wear their head
[02:04:39.680 --> 02:04:44.160]  dresses and their turbans and all that coming into the country, but citizens can't. Because
[02:04:44.160 --> 02:04:48.640]  it's not about, and I'm not saying the Muslims are terrorists, period. I'm saying it's all made
[02:04:48.640 --> 02:04:52.240]  up. It's about breaking us and training us we have no rights. Do you agree?
[02:04:53.280 --> 02:04:56.800]  Yes, let's have National Christian Day at the school.
[02:04:58.000 --> 02:05:03.280]  I'm calling for it, absolutely. National First Amendment Day, which includes
[02:05:04.000 --> 02:05:06.720]  freedom of religion and you can't bar what?
[02:05:06.720 --> 02:05:12.080]  You may be arrested and or subject to other police action.
[02:05:12.080 --> 02:05:17.200]  Tyranny is here. The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[02:05:17.200 --> 02:05:21.680]  It really says that the state is God. The United States is now recognized
[02:05:21.680 --> 02:05:27.040]  globally as one of the most impressive police states on Earth. This film conclusively proves
[02:05:27.040 --> 02:05:32.240]  the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps now being expanded nationwide. This
[02:05:32.240 --> 02:05:36.880]  documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful
[02:05:36.880 --> 02:05:41.440]  shadow state. Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depths to which our republic has
[02:05:41.440 --> 02:05:47.440]  fallen. Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship, body scammers,
[02:05:47.440 --> 02:05:52.880]  sound cams, citizen spies, stage terror and cameras on every street corner. It's only
[02:05:52.880 --> 02:05:58.480]  the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan. The police state isn't coming. It's here.

[02:08:20.240 --> 02:08:34.320]  You know, it hurts my feelings when I read on infoawars.com
[02:08:35.040 --> 02:08:38.480]  cops that sound like they're really good people going, hey, we don't want to die,
[02:08:38.480 --> 02:08:45.600]  we don't want to go home dead to our family. You know, we want to be able to protect ourselves.
[02:08:45.600 --> 02:08:49.200]  There could have been terrorists that they were with in any house. Well, yeah, I mean,
[02:08:49.200 --> 02:08:53.200]  there could be 10 foot tall blood-drinking lizards too. I mean, there's a reason we have
[02:08:53.200 --> 02:08:56.880]  a Bill of Rights and Constitution. There's a reason we've never seen this in an American city,
[02:08:56.880 --> 02:09:01.920]  locking down most of a city, pointing guns at everybody, including black women and blondes
[02:09:01.920 --> 02:09:08.560]  who clearly aren't your suspect. Well, you could have been with them. And this cop sent me an
[02:09:08.560 --> 02:09:12.480]  email. At the end of the show, I'm going to read this. We got Lindsey Williams giving us an update.
[02:09:12.480 --> 02:09:20.320]  He says breaking new news from his elite friend. So that is coming up, and I know who his source
[02:09:20.320 --> 02:09:24.400]  is. It is someone who's attended Bilderberg. It's always interesting, so we'll get that perspective.
[02:09:24.400 --> 02:09:27.440]  Emma, continue with your calls. Let's move quick now, because I'm pushing him back to go to these
[02:09:27.440 --> 02:09:32.240]  calls. I'm sorry to make you hold so long, but you know that's what I do. Teleprompter free.
[02:09:32.800 --> 02:09:36.880]  It's governor free, by the way, as well. There's nobody in control in here but me,
[02:09:36.880 --> 02:09:42.800]  and I'm not in control. Kind of scary, isn't it? Nick in New York, you're on the air. Welcome.
[02:09:43.680 --> 02:09:51.920]  Alex, buddy. Hail Cobra. What's going on today? Hail Cobra. Hail Cobra. Get the winners of it,
[02:09:51.920 --> 02:10:02.240]  either. Let's get hard to play. I saw the awesome Oblivion last night, and that was an amazing film,
[02:10:02.240 --> 02:10:07.680]  I have to say. I don't like Tom Cruise, and it made me like him. And again, it's because
[02:10:07.680 --> 02:10:14.000]  did you get all the messages? It's pro male. It's all wholesome. It's about family and generations.
[02:10:14.000 --> 02:10:20.320]  It's about kinship. It's about love, and it's about sacrifice, death. And it's about
[02:10:20.320 --> 02:10:27.360]  compartmentalization. Was it heavy like I said it was? It's something you don't see anymore.
[02:10:27.360 --> 02:10:30.640]  That's the thing. I mean, not only was it an amazing sci-fi film,
[02:10:30.640 --> 02:10:40.240]  but it had every aspect of hope. And we can get through this, and we can save the day.
[02:10:40.240 --> 02:10:44.080]  Well, I feel like Morgan Friedman when I'm arguing with somebody about the New World Order,
[02:10:44.080 --> 02:10:51.200]  and he's sitting there arguing with the Tom Cruise astronaut character. And he won't even
[02:10:51.200 --> 02:10:56.000]  argue with him. He just goes, uh-huh, that's what you think's going on? It's just like,
[02:10:56.000 --> 02:11:01.280]  because we know we're right. I mean, some things we're wrong about on the edges, but we know
[02:11:01.280 --> 02:11:06.480]  generally how right we are. It's like a joke how right we are, and having to argue with people.
[02:11:06.480 --> 02:11:11.120]  That's why when we get attacked in the media, or they say, I'm connected to the bombings now,
[02:11:11.120 --> 02:11:16.800]  you know, in the Associated Press and all this, it's just flailing. And then you know how evil
[02:11:16.800 --> 02:11:21.360]  the top of the pyramid is, literally Oblivion, the Black Pyramid. Hey, what do you think of the
[02:11:21.360 --> 02:11:26.800]  cover of the October issue being the bad guy from Oblivion, which they will not let that image out,
[02:11:26.800 --> 02:11:29.040]  I've discovered. They're really shutting it down when it gets out on the web.
[02:11:30.320 --> 02:11:31.680]  What'd you think of the bad guy in the movie?
[02:11:33.360 --> 02:11:38.320]  What, the eye at the end? Yeah, the big, black, upside-down pyramid with a red eye, yeah.
[02:11:40.160 --> 02:11:44.320]  The old-seeing eye? Yeah, I mean, the bad guy is the Illuminati,
[02:11:44.320 --> 02:11:49.920]  a technocratic, psychopathic entity. Well, you know what I thought was funny,
[02:11:49.920 --> 02:11:55.840]  was when, before the movie started, when the Universal logo came around, I didn't know
[02:11:55.840 --> 02:12:00.080]  anything about this film. I never read the graphic novel. I went in there, basically,
[02:12:00.080 --> 02:12:02.800]  and it turned you off yesterday when you were talking about it, because I'm like,
[02:12:02.800 --> 02:12:07.920]  I just want to see this film. So I did not know anything about the, you know, the pyramid or
[02:12:07.920 --> 02:12:13.600]  anything. But when I first saw the Universal logo coming around, and I saw that, that pyramid,
[02:12:13.600 --> 02:12:17.680]  I was like, wait a minute, are they really being this obnoxious now? Like, I didn't know that was
[02:12:17.680 --> 02:12:21.440]  part of the film. And then when I saw it in the film, I was like, all right, well, that makes
[02:12:21.440 --> 02:12:26.720]  sense. But I mean, you know, there's a lot of symbolism in the film that majority of the
[02:12:26.720 --> 02:12:32.960]  audiences will not get. No, no, I'm gonna be honest, we had rush tickets and a bunch of stuff,
[02:12:32.960 --> 02:12:36.240]  and probably could have got backstage and stuff. But I didn't go to rush last night,
[02:12:36.240 --> 02:12:38.560]  cuz I went back to see what my wife at Genghis, she wanted to see it.
[02:12:38.560 --> 02:12:43.360]  Plus I ran home and saw the kids. But I went back just to try to like see it again
[02:12:43.360 --> 02:12:48.240]  when I wasn't tired. And it's just the whole thing. It's definitely anti-illuminati. It is not
[02:12:49.200 --> 02:12:53.120]  a revelation of the method, externalization of the hierarchy. Do you agree with that analysis?
[02:12:53.120 --> 02:13:00.240]  Yeah, no, totally, totally. The thing I called yesterday to bring up, I mean, you haven't
[02:13:00.240 --> 02:13:06.080]  touched on this yet. But have you seen the, or just do you know about the associated press
[02:13:06.080 --> 02:13:10.800]  yesterday being hacked? Yeah, and saying the White House had been blown up?
[02:13:10.800 --> 02:13:16.880]  Yeah, I mean, I didn't really see much press about that.
[02:13:17.680 --> 02:13:21.520]  And I know you guys haven't discussed it yet, but I wondered what your insights of that was.
[02:13:23.200 --> 02:13:28.080]  Okay, well, the Syrian Free Army really is Syrian hackers, and they hacked CBS and put out stuff
[02:13:28.080 --> 02:13:32.480]  like the government's funding Al-Qaeda. It was all basically Assad stuff, so that was accurate,
[02:13:32.480 --> 02:13:36.800]  as I've seen them hack before. They did stuff like hack satellites with the Russians and
[02:13:36.800 --> 02:13:41.920]  show that the US, not the US, the globalists have hijacked our country. Might as well be aliens for
[02:13:41.920 --> 02:13:47.360]  that part. I mean, it's the same thing. It might as well be like slugs that climb in Obama's ear
[02:13:47.360 --> 02:13:51.440]  and are running it from planet Pop-Tart. That's how evil they are, how anti-human they are.
[02:13:52.080 --> 02:13:56.480]  I mean, they literally are just anathema. They're oblivion to everything in our society.
[02:13:57.600 --> 02:14:03.360]  But I believe they're doing that to get CISPA through the Senate. Because you can tell when
[02:14:03.360 --> 02:14:09.040]  they do a hack and it's ineffectual and it doesn't really hurt them. I mean, if there were hacks
[02:14:09.040 --> 02:14:14.880]  saying this CIA group is involved kidnapping kids and doing snuff films, you'd know it's real.
[02:14:15.840 --> 02:14:22.080]  But if it's a hack of something silly or something that makes it look like the president's under
[02:14:22.080 --> 02:14:28.880]  threat, that's them. Cuz see, that fits into Olympus' falling. That I haven't seen. I have
[02:14:28.880 --> 02:14:33.440]  no desire to see that film. Programming, programming. Yeah, no, I saw it and it was
[02:14:33.440 --> 02:14:38.960]  like half cops in the audience shuffling around. And it was like programming. It was like fake
[02:14:38.960 --> 02:14:41.840]  battle programming. They have to have an enemy, they believe they're fighting. So they have to
[02:14:41.840 --> 02:14:45.920]  have an occasional bombing and hype it up. But it's just programming, the brain takes it as real.
[02:14:45.920 --> 02:14:51.280]  So cops are walking around looking behind dumpsters and doing head rolls and in the shower,
[02:14:51.280 --> 02:14:56.480]  like Al Qaeda's everywhere. Meanwhile, the New World Order runs America. The devil force runs
[02:14:56.480 --> 02:15:01.120]  America, runs the world, and runs Al Qaeda. But see, it just doesn't compute. I'm like, hey, cops,
[02:15:01.120 --> 02:15:06.080]  government runs Al Qaeda. Here's Reuters. Yeah, that's what Al Qaeda'd probably say,
[02:15:06.080 --> 02:15:11.280]  Jones. You with them? And now the AP says I'm with them, see? And must be true. I mean,
[02:15:12.240 --> 02:15:15.200]  I'm so evil, I don't love the government. I mean, I must be with Al Qaeda.
[02:15:15.200 --> 02:15:18.400]  Thank you for the call, Nick. We're gonna go to break here in a moment, come back with
[02:15:18.400 --> 02:15:23.120]  Lindsey Williams with Breaking News here. Derek, and I'm told we now have him on the
[02:15:23.120 --> 02:15:26.560]  lines. We're going to him in a moment. Thank you for joining us, Lindsey. Let's go to Derek
[02:15:26.560 --> 02:15:31.440]  in Canada. You're on the air, sir. Go ahead. Hey, Alex. Good show today, man.
[02:15:31.440 --> 02:15:38.800]  Thank you. I'd like to address a popular photo circulating and possible use of actors involved
[02:15:38.800 --> 02:15:44.560]  at the actual bomb site. The one I'm talking about in particular, the media's really showing
[02:15:44.560 --> 02:15:51.520]  this a lot, of the guy with supposedly just lost two of his legs being helped by a guy in a cowboy
[02:15:51.520 --> 02:16:02.320]  hat, and he's on a wheelchair. There's actually a series of photos on this guy, but if someone has
[02:16:02.320 --> 02:16:09.040]  done sort of like a closer kind of look at the close-up shots of the bomb site itself, and it
[02:16:09.040 --> 02:16:16.400]  shows a hooded man in sunglasses, what looks like he's like dropping the guy on the ground, and then
[02:16:16.400 --> 02:16:24.000]  like all these sort of other suspicious-looking photos where, I mean, there's no actual blood
[02:16:24.000 --> 02:16:28.320]  squirting from this guy's two legs. Well, that's because they would have put a tourniquet on it.
[02:16:29.280 --> 02:16:37.040]  Let me just stop something here. They clearly had actors on 9-11 go and put out the official story
[02:16:38.480 --> 02:16:42.320]  over and over and over again that it was jet fuel that did it,
[02:16:42.320 --> 02:16:44.320]  pancaking, and then it fell into its own footprint.
[02:16:44.320 --> 02:16:48.480]  They clearly announced Building 7 had fallen before it fell. They false started on that,
[02:16:48.480 --> 02:16:55.360]  but the event was real. Sandy Hook Aurora was real. They clearly have had, because we proved
[02:16:55.360 --> 02:17:00.400]  this and I didn't even go with it, cuz I said the media will attack us. We found two of the people
[02:17:00.400 --> 02:17:06.320]  are actually pretty successful actors and admit their actors and even use their real names.
[02:17:06.320 --> 02:17:10.000]  But I thought, well, maybe real actors could just actually be in the movie theater, but
[02:17:10.000 --> 02:17:14.000]  the guy goes, here's my ticket. I was really there, and then he tells the official story.
[02:17:14.000 --> 02:17:17.040]  And the other guy does it. So it looks like, yes, and the government loves you,
[02:17:17.600 --> 02:17:21.680]  brought to you by Doritos, brought to you by Pepsi. I mean, it's like product placement,
[02:17:21.680 --> 02:17:27.120]  propaganda placement. So that goes on. But then when you say no one was killed at Sandy Hook,
[02:17:27.120 --> 02:17:32.400]  no, no, no, they like killing kids. That was a holiday for the folks that did it.
[02:17:32.400 --> 02:17:36.240]  And you had people in the same camo pants and black shirt caught by local police,
[02:17:36.240 --> 02:17:39.840]  who they were then ordered to release. And they said, that's a conspiracy theory,
[02:17:39.840 --> 02:17:45.760]  even though the video and the arrest is actually on record. So yeah, there's the signs of them
[02:17:45.760 --> 02:17:50.400]  involved, but they're gonna kill real people. They enjoy that. I mean, it's not just like
[02:17:50.400 --> 02:17:54.880]  they don't care. They're in this job. The favorite thing is to kill little kids.
[02:17:55.520 --> 02:18:01.200]  So that's my bottom line there. Thank you, Derrick. I mean, could they have actors with
[02:18:01.200 --> 02:18:07.280]  fake legs blown off? I've seen people with a leg chopped off before. And it's turning it,
[02:18:07.280 --> 02:18:10.720]  got around it, and they were in shock and turned white and just laid back. I mean, you can
[02:18:12.800 --> 02:18:15.840]  have your legs blown off. And if they're not sliced off clean, they'll stop bleeding on their
[02:18:15.840 --> 02:18:21.840]  own sometimes. But I don't wanna get into it with people, whatever. The media wants to go with that.
[02:18:21.840 --> 02:18:26.880]  They don't wanna look at, Tamerlan now coming out was in the CIA and had aliases that's
[02:18:26.880 --> 02:18:30.400]  mainstream news confirmed. They didn't even hide those facts now. That broke today.
[02:18:30.400 --> 02:18:33.600]  They don't want you to know about the senator saying there was prior knowledge. They don't
[02:18:33.600 --> 02:18:38.880]  want you talking about the drill, which was used as a smokescreen. They want you to focus on
[02:18:38.880 --> 02:18:44.880]  no one died, and it's all a 3D projection from the Black Pyramid. Let's talk to Jenny
[02:18:44.880 --> 02:18:47.680]  in California. You got about a minute and a half. We're going to break with Lindsay Williams. Go
[02:18:47.680 --> 02:18:55.280]  ahead. Hey, Jenny, come on down. Welcome. I'm excited I finally got on.
[02:18:56.400 --> 02:19:00.560]  So I'll say I actually just have a couple questions instead of any kind of comments.
[02:19:00.560 --> 02:19:06.400]  When you talk about the martial law, you always say if it happened in Austin, you're not gonna
[02:19:06.400 --> 02:19:11.760]  stay in your home. You're gonna, you know, go out and still live your life. I live here in
[02:19:11.760 --> 02:19:18.320]  California, and I've actually heard of a couple events that may or may not happen. And, you know,
[02:19:18.320 --> 02:19:29.280]  maybe my area might be closed down. So my question is, if I would not, you know, go with what they
[02:19:29.280 --> 02:19:33.920]  go with what they do when they tried to come to my house, what do you think they will do to me?
[02:19:33.920 --> 02:19:40.080]  Do you think they're going to put me in jail and make me the terrorist? That's what my question is.
[02:19:40.080 --> 02:19:44.000]  No, no, look, they're gonna just keep staging this and get you used, just like they have the
[02:19:44.000 --> 02:19:48.800]  children locked down, get in a fetal position so the death count can be higher, duck and cover when
[02:19:48.800 --> 02:19:55.360]  the Russians A bomb you. They always say, do what we say, go into a catatonic position when we tell
[02:19:55.360 --> 02:20:00.000]  you so they're in control. It's prisoner training. Okay, lock down everybody, hands up against the
[02:20:00.000 --> 02:20:06.400]  walls. That's the Nazis, everybody up against the wall. This is prisoner training, TSA all of it is,
[02:20:06.400 --> 02:20:12.160]  they admit it, they've written handbooks on it. But this is all control of the situation training.
[02:20:12.160 --> 02:20:16.400]  And that we're all suspects and this cop, you know, that commented on info or said, hey,
[02:20:16.400 --> 02:20:20.880]  we've got everybody's a suspect. We had to have the women come out with their hands up.
[02:20:20.880 --> 02:20:25.760]  You know, who knows, maybe that blonde woman, maybe the black lady is an accomplice. You know,
[02:20:25.760 --> 02:20:29.760]  everyone's a suspect but them who have a history of staging it.
[02:20:29.760 --> 02:20:32.880]  And we're gonna skip this network break, obviously, and go to Williams here in a moment. So
[02:20:34.160 --> 02:20:39.520]  if there's martial law, I'm not planning to go out and offensively fight with people.
[02:20:39.520 --> 02:20:44.960]  What am I gonna do? Go fight with poor cops? I mean, they're literally brainwashed clones.
[02:20:44.960 --> 02:20:49.280]  They might as well be the Tom Cruise character. I just want them to be free.
[02:20:49.280 --> 02:20:53.760]  It's ridiculous. I mean, no, no, I'm trying to stop a civil war.
[02:20:54.800 --> 02:20:58.720]  But once they start gun confiscations and burning down patriots' homes and doing all this,
[02:20:58.720 --> 02:21:02.080]  and they'll shut down communications during this, people are gonna know,
[02:21:02.080 --> 02:21:06.720]  especially military folks, and they're not gonna just wait for the cops to come to their house.
[02:21:07.280 --> 02:21:09.920]  Once the cops are committing these crimes like redcoats,
[02:21:11.040 --> 02:21:16.080]  under the rule of common law and our Declaration of Independence, they're open season.
[02:21:16.080 --> 02:21:21.120]  And I've warned the police, the police know this. I mean, I've heard the local former,
[02:21:21.120 --> 02:21:26.320]  local sergeant, Sergeant Sam, Sam Cox. I guess we could say we're friends. I've hung out with
[02:21:26.320 --> 02:21:31.120]  him a couple times. He's come by the office, but I heard him on the radio a few weeks ago.
[02:21:31.120 --> 02:21:34.160]  He goes, if they try to take the guns, there's gonna be a civil war.
[02:21:34.160 --> 02:21:37.600]  The collateral damage will be incredible. People aren't turning their guns in. He goes,
[02:21:37.600 --> 02:21:41.680]  and I'm not turning my guns in. And Larry Pratt's not turning his guns in, and none of us are.
[02:21:41.680 --> 02:21:50.320]  My point is, this is horrible, but you're in the wrong. Don't cross this line. And look,
[02:21:50.320 --> 02:21:53.120]  they're gonna start it, and they're gonna blow stuff up and blame it on us,
[02:21:53.120 --> 02:21:55.760]  so they can be the good guys and we'll be the terrorists. I've told you this.
[02:21:56.400 --> 02:21:59.920]  I mean, they're trying to connect me to the bombings now. I can read you the headlines
[02:21:59.920 --> 02:22:03.360]  where Alex Jones influenced bombers, blah, blah, blah, it's everywhere.
[02:22:03.920 --> 02:22:09.840]  And someday it'll be Alex Jones is arrested. And if they torture me hard enough, electroshock and
[02:22:09.840 --> 02:22:15.200]  stuff, I won't even know who I am. They'll put me on sodium pentothal, roll me out, do an hour-long
[02:22:15.200 --> 02:22:20.080]  taped interview until I finally say, I did it, yeah, I did it. They've got the younger brother
[02:22:20.080 --> 02:22:24.720]  of Tamerlan who can't even talk, but they're in the news saying, he admits he did it, he's guilty.
[02:22:24.720 --> 02:22:30.560]  I mean, that's the opposite of our free society. And they're all like, it's the Muslim threat.
[02:22:30.560 --> 02:22:34.480]  Why is our president behind the Muslim threat? Because they're radicalizing Muslims to wreck
[02:22:34.480 --> 02:22:40.800]  the Middle East, it's a public plan. It's called the class of civilizations. They want Shiite and
[02:22:40.800 --> 02:22:45.040]  Sunni killing each other. Syria has been a stable country, that's why they're overtaking it.
[02:22:45.040 --> 02:22:48.800]  Libya was a stable country, certainly not a fan of Gaddafi, but compared to Al-Qaeda,
[02:22:48.800 --> 02:22:53.760]  he was a good guy. They're overthrowing it all. So I want the police to know,
[02:22:53.760 --> 02:22:59.120]  you're not just gonna come burn down all our houses. You engage in enough atrocities,
[02:22:59.120 --> 02:23:03.280]  people are gonna fight back. And the globalists don't care, they'll just get more drones.
[02:23:03.280 --> 02:23:10.080]  You're seen as drones, you're seen as a clone. You are called a biological android by the
[02:23:10.080 --> 02:23:15.520]  globalists. I've read stuff where Bertrand Russell, in the 40s, was calling police
[02:23:15.520 --> 02:23:19.520]  and their minions programmable, that's what they call TV programming, like you're stupid.
[02:23:20.240 --> 02:23:24.240]  Programmable human resources, biological androids.
[02:23:26.560 --> 02:23:30.400]  I mean, I don't like being called an android myself. I'm not an android, okay?
[02:23:30.400 --> 02:23:35.040]  I got free will, I can learn, I'm smart, and I'm just as good as you, New World Order.
[02:23:35.040 --> 02:23:41.040]  I'm just as smart as you. I just don't have a flavor. I don't have a taste to dominate people.
[02:23:42.560 --> 02:23:47.120]  I like to sit there and watch a movie with my wife and drink cold beer with a fat French
[02:23:47.120 --> 02:23:50.960]  bulldog's head on my lap. I never get tired of that. I never get tired of gardening.
[02:23:50.960 --> 02:23:54.720]  I never get tired of hunting and shooting. I never get tired of hiking. I never get tired
[02:23:54.720 --> 02:23:59.360]  of seeing my family. I never get tired, and you think I'm a freak. Your textbooks say I'm a bad
[02:23:59.360 --> 02:24:04.080]  guy. Thank you, man, for the call. All this stuff about how the family's bad. No, you're bad.
[02:24:04.640 --> 02:24:09.600]  You're bad, and you just wanna abuse nice things. You wanna screw up nice things. Come on in, crew.
[02:24:12.400 --> 02:24:16.480]  We have a short video clip of Adandi at the press conference showing him stand up and show
[02:24:16.480 --> 02:24:22.720]  his pictures before getting surrounded by the bald Secret Service agent. All right,
[02:24:22.720 --> 02:24:26.480]  we'll have that video added or uploaded to YouTube and added to Adandi Salazar's video
[02:24:26.480 --> 02:24:31.280]  if you give it to Rob, or any of the crew, that'd be good. Good job. We'll show that coming up.
[02:24:31.280 --> 02:24:58.240]  But absolutely, they do not like this information.

[02:27:41.360 --> 02:27:45.440]  Did you know that mercury from your dental fillings comes off your teeth both as a vapor
[02:27:45.440 --> 02:27:49.920]  and as metal particles into your body? Wherever mercury deposits in your body, it stops cells
[02:27:49.920 --> 02:27:54.160]  from functioning normally. Animal studies show that mercury causes kidney function to drop by
[02:27:54.160 --> 02:27:59.200]  60 percent. Mercury deposited into your adrenals or thyroid will cause a corresponding drop in
[02:27:59.200 --> 02:28:03.760]  function. The number one method by which your body detoxifies itself of mercury is glutathione.
[02:28:03.760 --> 02:28:09.680]  The number one superfood that helps turn on all 75 trillion cells of your body to produce glutathione
[02:28:09.680 --> 02:28:15.760]  is non-denatured whey protein from grass-fed cows. After investigating most high-end whey proteins
[02:28:15.760 --> 02:28:20.640]  on the market, only one is the most non-denatured, the most active, the most complete, and in our
[02:28:20.640 --> 02:28:26.240]  opinion, the most powerful in what nature originally put into the fresh raw whey. It is

[02:29:39.360 --> 02:29:44.000]  author of the best-selling book, Cancer Step Outside the Box. I want you to know some very
[02:29:44.000 --> 02:29:50.160]  important information. In 1985, President Ronald Reagan requested that Carnivora be sent directly
[02:29:50.160 --> 02:29:54.320]  to the White House at a time when only the President could obtain this world-class healer.
[02:29:54.880 --> 02:30:00.400]  Now, 27 years later, Carnivora capsules are used around the world to keep people healthy.
[02:30:00.400 --> 02:30:06.000]  Now you can protect yourself and your loved ones in this age of superbugs with 17 naturally occurring
[02:30:06.000 --> 02:30:11.680]  compounds that instinctively respond to abnormal cells only without harming a single normal cell.
[02:30:11.680 --> 02:30:16.240]  If you want to stay healthy, now's your chance to literally wake up your critical immune cells
[02:30:16.240 --> 02:30:18.880]  to attack harmful invaders that don't belong in your body.
[02:30:19.440 --> 02:30:30.720]  Call 1-866-VenusFly or order from Carnivora.com. That's C-A-R-N-I-V-O-R-A dot com. That's 1-866-836-8735
[02:30:30.720 --> 02:30:45.760]  1-866-VenusFly or visit Carnivora.com. Protect your immune system. It's the only one you've got.
[02:30:53.200 --> 02:30:58.560]  By the way, here's the info up at Infowars.com right now. Illegal immigrant testifies before
[02:30:58.560 --> 02:31:04.640]  Senate Judiciary Committee wants American Dream for her 11 million cohorts. But I can't go to
[02:31:04.640 --> 02:31:11.520]  Mexico. That's predominantly the majority of this group. I can't go there and then get a bunch of
[02:31:11.520 --> 02:31:18.960]  free stuff for myself. That's up at Infowars.com. But then you look over here at DrudgeReport.com,
[02:31:18.960 --> 02:31:25.040]  Obama administration paying people to recruit folks onto food stamps. That's Washington Post.
[02:31:25.040 --> 02:31:32.400]  Traud more than doubles in three years. That's CNN News. Report IRS issued billions
[02:31:32.400 --> 02:31:38.320]  in improper tax refunds. Yeah, right here in Austin, one house got something like $89 million.
[02:31:40.800 --> 02:31:45.280]  They didn't get in trouble either. It's kind of like the guy they think sent to Ryerson.
[02:31:45.280 --> 02:31:49.760]  He's probably was put up to it by him. If you look at the intel, then now he has to be let go.
[02:31:49.760 --> 02:31:56.400]  He said he's part of a secret army for Obama. It is an army of just lawlessness. Man, these people
[02:31:56.400 --> 02:32:01.840]  are sick. And the legal immigration is over the top cuz here's the deal. Just like the supposed
[02:32:01.840 --> 02:32:07.680]  bomber patsies, we're headed to New York City to party and we're on all this welfare and had
[02:32:08.560 --> 02:32:14.400]  elite tuitions paid for. Folks, when you're a citizen and you are seen as a libertarian or
[02:32:14.400 --> 02:32:19.840]  conservative, you don't get anything. All the doors are shut to you because you're seen as
[02:32:19.840 --> 02:32:24.880]  coming from a culture of guns and liberty. The globalists are bringing in foreigners not to
[02:32:24.880 --> 02:32:29.600]  make them Americans, but because they come from countries where they're slaves, they'll play ball.
[02:32:30.800 --> 02:32:35.600]  And this is a sadistic takeover because the globalists have a score to settle with America.
[02:32:36.560 --> 02:32:42.000]  We're gonna be leveled. Just remember that, folks. Lindsey Williams, we're almost out of
[02:32:42.000 --> 02:32:46.480]  time. I'm gonna go into overdrive and get calls here. But the time we have right now,
[02:32:47.440 --> 02:32:53.600]  bottom line, they are trying to impoverish the world and that's the stated plans of the globalist.
[02:32:53.600 --> 02:32:57.280]  It's the stated plans to get our pension funds and bank accounts. What do you got on the war front
[02:32:57.920 --> 02:33:02.400]  from your associate? You're saying a number of months. How long till they,
[02:33:02.400 --> 02:33:07.520]  cuz I know Congress is talking about lovingly taking over retirement accounts to safeguard them,
[02:33:07.520 --> 02:33:15.440]  but also tax them. This is after tax money. Thank you for listening to GCN.

[02:35:04.000 --> 02:35:06.000]  All right, we're in the fourth hour of overdrive. I want to welcome the
[02:35:06.000 --> 02:35:08.800]  stations that follow us here. I used to do four hours. I went back to three because I
[02:35:08.800 --> 02:35:12.800]  do the nightly news, but I end up doing four. So I should have just said the show's always four hours
[02:35:12.800 --> 02:35:17.200]  because some stations quit carrying the fourth hour, which is a tragedy. And so did XM.
[02:35:18.800 --> 02:35:23.280]  So because I pointed out it wasn't live, they didn't know for years it wasn't live,
[02:35:23.280 --> 02:35:26.240]  but it's live a lot of the time now and we're live, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:35:26.240 --> 02:35:30.800]  I got to reset and recap. It's like living in a movie, having my life. And I don't say
[02:35:30.800 --> 02:35:36.080]  that in an excited way. It's a big responsibility and I'm just a regular guy and I'm not up to all
[02:35:36.080 --> 02:35:42.800]  this. But I try to be as moral as I can, I try to be the best person I can. And also at the same
[02:35:42.800 --> 02:35:48.880]  time, try to pay our way to fight the globalist so we can fund ourselves without being under
[02:35:48.880 --> 02:35:53.280]  globalist funding or control. There's just so much going on in this world. Let's go to your
[02:35:53.280 --> 02:35:57.520]  phone calls. I'm gonna recap the top stories. Some big breaking news that is just epic.
[02:35:57.520 --> 02:36:05.680]  The big brother on record documents released in Georgia training under a CIA program,
[02:36:06.320 --> 02:36:11.360]  which we already knew. It's like never ending. Why did it have to be the government again?
[02:36:11.360 --> 02:36:15.520]  It's so creepy to see all those Boston cops involved in it as well.
[02:36:16.560 --> 02:36:21.840]  I mean, and I'm not saying they're involved doing it, but going along with it. And they
[02:36:21.840 --> 02:36:25.920]  grabbed that guy and cut his larynx out immediately. They wanted him dead, but the
[02:36:25.920 --> 02:36:30.640]  media had the live feed of it. It's just horrible. But I mean, that's what they do all day long. I
[02:36:30.640 --> 02:36:34.640]  mean, they'll cluster bomb Iraqis and make jokes about it and watch the videos back at base like
[02:36:34.640 --> 02:36:38.720]  it's fun. You have empathy for a reason, folks. It's all gonna come back on us.
[02:36:39.440 --> 02:36:43.520]  Jordan in Missouri, a shoddy national suspect here on the air. That's the
[02:36:43.520 --> 02:36:47.600]  point you wanna raise? Go ahead, brother. Yeah, Alex, it's good to talk to you, man.
[02:36:47.600 --> 02:36:51.840]  I salute you and your team for what you do. You put your lives on the line. I appreciate it and
[02:36:51.840 --> 02:36:55.680]  so does everyone else. And I've been waking up a lot of people about this stuff. But anyways,
[02:36:55.680 --> 02:36:59.360]  I wanted to ask you about that Saudi national, cuz I don't know if you've seen it. But Glenn
[02:36:59.360 --> 02:37:06.880]  Beck was on YouTube saying, I give Obama till Monday to tell the truth about the Boston bombing.
[02:37:06.880 --> 02:37:11.920]  But I'm gonna release information on the Saudi national. And of course, he never came out and
[02:37:11.920 --> 02:37:15.840]  said anything about it. And that's Glenn Beck for you. Don't stick to his word.
[02:37:15.840 --> 02:37:22.080]  He loves suckering people. He's a nasty, I'm not gonna take it back. He knows there's FEMA camps,
[02:37:22.080 --> 02:37:28.720]  the legislation, the bills, the civilian inmate labor camp guys pull up in a reeducation camp
[02:37:28.720 --> 02:37:34.160]  army manual, army.mil. Show it to viewers. I'll give people the FM number. And he knows all that
[02:37:34.160 --> 02:37:38.000]  and builds it up. It's real. I'm gonna expose it in one month and then makes fun of everybody
[02:37:38.000 --> 02:37:42.160]  and says it isn't real and shows the straw man. And I said, he'll come out and admit this guy's
[02:37:42.160 --> 02:37:47.200]  on a terror watch list or his family was in Saudi Arabia and that the White House covered it up.
[02:37:47.200 --> 02:37:52.720]  That was all already in the news. And it's just like, talk about over-promising, under-delivering.
[02:37:52.720 --> 02:37:56.560]  We are the opposite here, which is actually a problem I have. I need to learn how to build
[02:37:56.560 --> 02:38:04.560]  stuff up because we under-promise, over-deliver. And I mean, we have these guys are CIA.
[02:38:04.560 --> 02:38:09.920]  We have them as set up patsies. The only way that it isn't a staged inside job,
[02:38:09.920 --> 02:38:14.560]  and it's one in a thousand, is that they were triple agents and double-crossed.
[02:38:14.560 --> 02:38:19.200]  Cuz see, they were CIA. They were used to infiltrate Muslim mosques and stuff,
[02:38:19.200 --> 02:38:27.200]  which is the perfect cover. The perfect cover to have somebody talking about how they're gonna
[02:38:27.200 --> 02:38:32.320]  blow stuff up so that they look like a terrorist later. But they had McVeigh spying on militias,
[02:38:32.320 --> 02:38:36.320]  going around talking about terror everywhere. That way, when they actually blew something up
[02:38:36.320 --> 02:38:42.560]  and blamed him as a patsy, and he was there, by the way, part of the operation, part of the sting,
[02:38:42.560 --> 02:38:46.960]  he thought, then they would be able to say, see, he walked around saying he was a terrorist
[02:38:46.960 --> 02:38:53.520]  at all these gun shows and things. So I'm a little bit tired today for whatever reason.
[02:38:54.160 --> 02:38:58.240]  Got to bed late, got up so early. I'm just so sick of it all. It makes my head hurt.
[02:38:59.200 --> 02:39:03.920]  It makes my head hurt to have the articles up at Infowars.com right now,
[02:39:06.240 --> 02:39:12.080]  where the Russian news and the Georgian news is reporting. And now the police state measures
[02:39:12.080 --> 02:39:16.240]  of the Kentucky Derby. God, now you can't take your own chair or cooler. You gotta buy it all
[02:39:16.240 --> 02:39:21.360]  there. Yeah, just wreck it all cuz somebody might bring a bomb in. My God. Why don't people say,
[02:39:21.360 --> 02:39:27.040]  hey, we're really Boston strong, Boston brave. We're not gonna check any of the backpacks.
[02:39:27.040 --> 02:39:42.720]  You know what? Your terrorism doesn't affect us. No, it's the opposite.
[02:39:57.040 --> 02:40:01.280]  Guess who will be there? Hi, I'm Dr. Joel Wallach, the dead doctors don't lie guy.
[02:40:01.280 --> 02:40:05.600]  And I prescribe the healthy body challenge and I'll be there. Hi, this is pharmacist Ben Fuchs,
[02:40:05.600 --> 02:40:09.840]  and I'm taking the healthy body challenge and I will be there. Hi, I'm Dr. Peter Glidden. I'm
[02:40:09.840 --> 02:40:15.120]  doing the healthy body challenge and I'll see you at the Young Jevity conference in May. Take the
[02:40:15.120 --> 02:40:20.160]  healthy body challenge and don't miss the Young Jevity convention in Las Vegas, Nevada, May 2nd

[02:40:36.640 --> 02:40:41.520]  because you couldn't afford to pay your electric bill. That's closer than you think. You probably
[02:40:41.520 --> 02:40:45.600]  haven't heard about this yet because the liberal media has been suppressing what is fast becoming
[02:40:45.600 --> 02:40:52.000]  the most shocking news story of 2012. Obama's secret war on coal that could increase your
[02:40:52.000 --> 02:40:58.320]  already high power bill as much as 400% in coming months. As shocking as it sounds, it may well be
[02:40:58.320 --> 02:41:03.120]  just a matter of time before the lights start going out across America. But here's some good
[02:41:03.120 --> 02:41:09.840]  news. There's an underground video at exposed123.com that thousands of smart patriots have used to
[02:41:09.840 --> 02:41:15.680]  end their slavery to the corrupt electricity monopoly. The video at exposed123.com has
[02:41:15.680 --> 02:41:20.320]  already been banned by Google and the liberal media is doing everything in its power to take
[02:41:20.320 --> 02:41:27.280]  it down and keep America in the dark. So watch it now at exposed123.com before it's too late. Again,
[02:41:27.280 --> 02:41:34.960]  that's exposed123.com. Are you an inventor or do you know an inventor who would like to attempt to

[02:42:34.320 --> 02:42:56.320]  proudly presents the Alex Jones Show because there's a war on for your mind.
[02:42:56.320 --> 02:43:00.560]  We're usually recording CNN, Fox and a bunch of others when there's breaking news
[02:43:00.560 --> 02:43:06.160]  and I believe we were taping. I was almost late getting back in here in studio. It's 208 Central
[02:43:06.160 --> 02:43:13.040]  time on this Wednesday edition. I was almost late. Mischa, the foggy guy overseas that says
[02:43:13.040 --> 02:43:19.840]  Tamerlan and his brother, the two brothers, were Alex Jones listeners. And it's all because of Alex
[02:43:19.840 --> 02:43:24.720]  Jones, the shadowy influence. They're now admitting no one can find him and there's no proof.
[02:43:24.720 --> 02:43:29.360]  Is Mischa at Lanely, Virginia? Is that where Mischa is?
[02:43:30.880 --> 02:43:35.440]  I mean, I'm on air here, folks, and they've got a senator. Will you guys cue up the senator clip?
[02:43:36.160 --> 02:43:42.160]  They've got a senator coming out, Chambliss.
[02:43:44.640 --> 02:43:49.200]  Oh, my headset just fell off. I got in here so quick. It's like rocket science, the tape back
[02:43:49.200 --> 02:43:53.360]  there. We had a big meeting and how many people does it take to get a thing recorded? But when
[02:43:53.360 --> 02:43:58.880]  DVRs are running, you can always back them back out. Yeah, who is Mischa? And that's Tamerlan's
[02:43:58.880 --> 02:44:02.800]  friend had strong religious beliefs. That's who did it. And they're on there admitting
[02:44:02.800 --> 02:44:14.880]  they can't find Mischa. Maybe Mischa is the same guy who
[02:44:14.880 --> 02:44:27.760]  was involved in having the drill. Maybe Mischa is behind everything. So
[02:44:30.080 --> 02:44:32.000]  this is really getting hard to deal with at this point.
[02:44:34.480 --> 02:44:40.080]  Chambliss, a law enforcement agency, may have had info about Boston bombing in advance.
[02:44:40.080 --> 02:44:47.920]  Georgia Senator Saxby Chambliss told Channel 2 Action News last night that the law enforcement
[02:44:47.920 --> 02:44:51.760]  agency may have had information in advance of the Boston bombings that wasn't properly shared.
[02:44:51.760 --> 02:44:56.400]  Oh, gee, think so? And now it's come out in the Russian news and mainline news,
[02:44:56.400 --> 02:45:02.400]  Boston bombers roll in the CIA and Chechen terror and Islamic terror from caucus's next phase and
[02:45:02.400 --> 02:45:08.320]  plan to undermine liberty, part of the Jamestown's Abigna Brzezinski group. And then they have the
[02:45:08.320 --> 02:45:14.880]  Secret Service running around telling us, do we have the clip of Chambliss? Okay, good.
[02:45:14.880 --> 02:45:19.520]  Then we have the Secret Service running around, coming up to our reporters saying,
[02:45:19.520 --> 02:45:23.920]  don't hand out photos, don't talk to the press. That video's up on infowars.com now,
[02:45:24.480 --> 02:45:29.360]  and photos of it. I mean, they are scared to death. And I mean, I'm just sitting here
[02:45:29.360 --> 02:45:32.640]  watching all this happen in front of me, and it's just completely blowing me away.
[02:45:33.200 --> 02:45:36.000]  So let's go ahead and go to that clip of the senator and then back to your phone calls.
[02:45:36.000 --> 02:45:40.320]  Senator Saxby Chambliss told Channel 2 Action News within the past hour
[02:45:40.320 --> 02:45:45.520]  that a law enforcement agency may have had information in advance of the Boston bombings,
[02:45:45.520 --> 02:45:49.920]  information that was not properly shared. First, bringing you up to date on the investigation
[02:45:49.920 --> 02:45:54.880]  tonight, two officials say that Tamerlan Tsarnaev liked to look at extremist websites.
[02:45:54.880 --> 02:45:59.360]  He died in a violent getaway attempt last week. His younger brother remains in a hospital. Today,
[02:45:59.360 --> 02:46:03.600]  we found out that he is in fair condition. And Senator Chambliss talked to us about the
[02:46:03.600 --> 02:46:07.520]  information that was not shared with law enforcement. He wouldn't elaborate on the
[02:46:07.520 --> 02:46:13.520]  agency or what the information was. There now appears that there may have been some
[02:46:13.520 --> 02:46:19.440]  evidence that was obtained by one of the law enforcement agencies that did not get shared
[02:46:19.440 --> 02:46:24.480]  in a way that it should have been. If that turns out to be the case, then we have to determine
[02:46:24.480 --> 02:46:30.080]  whether or not that would have made a difference. Today, we learned 50 people are still in the
[02:46:30.080 --> 02:46:33.760]  hospital in the Boston area. Some of them are now without limbs.
[02:46:33.760 --> 02:46:40.800]  Uh-huh. Land of the free, home of the brave. Again, the article is up at infoawards.com right now.
[02:46:45.040 --> 02:46:51.200]  Right now, we have the headline, Tamerlan attended CIA sponsored workshop. He had aliases.
[02:46:51.760 --> 02:46:55.600]  He had it all. And Kurt Nemo has been adding to that article since it broke.
[02:46:55.600 --> 02:46:59.200]  Uh, we need to add the whole history of it. The head of the MI6,
[02:46:59.920 --> 02:47:08.240]  you know, the head of the bombing on 77 was MI6. It just goes on and on and on and on.
[02:47:09.920 --> 02:47:14.000]  That story needs to get out to everybody. Cuz, you know, we tend to put out one article about
[02:47:14.000 --> 02:47:17.840]  something about, look, he had an alias they let him use, which shows he was an intelligence
[02:47:17.840 --> 02:47:21.600]  operative. Hey, look, the Russians inquired about him to blow his cover. Hey, look,
[02:47:21.600 --> 02:47:28.880]  now he's hanging out at a Zbigniew Brzezinski CIA training system to infiltrate and kick the
[02:47:28.880 --> 02:47:33.120]  Russians out of different countries. I mean, this is incredible. And they're not there to kick the
[02:47:33.120 --> 02:47:38.240]  Russians out to bring freedom. They're there to put in Al-Qaeda to turn the place into a
[02:47:38.240 --> 02:47:44.640]  Stone Age hellhole, like Libya and Syria. I mean, it's so immoral, but they want to do that to
[02:47:44.640 --> 02:47:51.920]  America too. They're wrecking America. And then using the threat, American Free Press, UK
[02:47:51.920 --> 02:47:57.840]  Bilderberg 2013 meeting confirmed. That makes me think it might not be confirmed.
[02:47:59.200 --> 02:48:02.160]  Because it's been all over the map, you know, thinking it was in the US and stuff,
[02:48:02.160 --> 02:48:04.960]  but I know they put out this info. Good job for them getting that.
[02:48:04.960 --> 02:48:10.640]  Watson has, I think she confirmed it about a month ago, or I guess three weeks ago. So,
[02:48:10.640 --> 02:48:16.480]  there's the AFP podcast where they're talking about it, so.
[02:48:18.400 --> 02:48:25.280]  But it looks like that is the case, so. AFP, Mark Anderson. Hey, get Mark Anderson on,
[02:48:25.280 --> 02:48:28.960]  guys, in the next few days for a quick pop in. We've got Mark's number on the computer,
[02:48:28.960 --> 02:48:34.000]  at least we did 100 times ago. But we need to get Mark Anderson on American Free Press,
[02:48:34.000 --> 02:48:41.360]  UK Bilderberg 2013 meeting confirmed. And it's an Infowars.com story. And he got an
[02:48:41.360 --> 02:48:44.720]  email from a Grove employee apparently confirming UK based Bilderberg meeting
[02:48:45.440 --> 02:48:50.480]  this coming June. Anderson writes, an email replied AFP from the Grove staffer and
[02:48:51.520 --> 02:48:54.320]  a check with the hotel website. Yeah, we've actually been by there.
[02:48:55.040 --> 02:48:59.600]  Calendar confirmed the hotel is booked solid June 5th through the 9th. The Bilderberg meeting
[02:48:59.600 --> 02:49:05.760]  itself, by all the latest indications, is to take place June 6th of the 9th. This updates
[02:49:05.760 --> 02:49:10.160]  the recent AFP report that stated England was likely general meeting location. But the meeting
[02:49:10.160 --> 02:49:14.880]  would be held June 9th, the 11th at the time the hotel with the meeting was to be held was not yet
[02:49:14.880 --> 02:49:23.120]  known. We should probably, just not that I care, but just for accuracy, we should probably add
[02:49:23.120 --> 02:49:30.320]  that it was Infowars.com that confirmed it was England. Just watch this, Infowars.com.
[02:49:32.880 --> 02:49:38.800]  Bilderberg, Bilderberg in England.
[02:49:38.800 --> 02:49:51.360]  And there's a story, April 13th, a confed set to take place in Watford, UK.
[02:49:52.560 --> 02:49:57.920]  Paul Joseph Watson's, I guess it was two weeks ago. I think he had one before that too. Hotel
[02:49:57.920 --> 02:50:01.840]  staff told high profile group will descend on luxury venue. I don't care, it's a great article
[02:50:01.840 --> 02:50:06.320]  our Infowars guy wrote. I'm happy to promote what Anderson's doing, he's a good guy. Hope to have
[02:50:06.320 --> 02:50:11.760]  him on this year if I don't go. I'll have him on regardless, I'll be sending somebody. I kind of
[02:50:11.760 --> 02:50:15.120]  like to hide out in the shadows though, I don't like being a rock star, I'll be honest with you.
[02:50:16.000 --> 02:50:18.880]  It's pretty amazing when I go to these things, what happens to the press.
[02:50:21.520 --> 02:50:24.720]  I like hot dogs, but I don't want to go to a hot dog eating contest and eat 100 of them,
[02:50:24.720 --> 02:50:32.080]  you know what I mean? It's just kind of like, will you guys have this article added to the
[02:50:32.080 --> 02:50:37.200]  one that's on Infowars so people can actually see photos of the facility and the rest of it.
[02:50:38.320 --> 02:50:41.680]  And I believe, yeah, we got the date right whenever we reported it.
[02:50:41.680 --> 02:50:44.320]  Let me see if that's the same thing that American Free Press has got
[02:50:46.000 --> 02:50:50.160]  on their deal. Yeah, they got six of the ninth too. Okay, that's enough of me.
[02:50:50.160 --> 02:50:56.000]  Let's go to your phone calls. Clint in Kentucky, hey, you don't have due process anymore. They
[02:50:56.000 --> 02:51:00.720]  said they can stop and frisk anybody they want. Cuz the terrorists in Kentucky, land of the free
[02:51:00.720 --> 02:51:06.880]  home of the brave, huh? No, not anymore. I was gonna say, man, I was on hold yesterday when you
[02:51:06.880 --> 02:51:10.960]  had to close the show out. I really wanted to talk to you yesterday because I could hear a disgust.
[02:51:10.960 --> 02:51:15.280]  I could hear anger in your voice. And I want to let you know that not only am I praying for you,
[02:51:15.280 --> 02:51:20.080]  for your safety, your strength, and your patience, but I want to ask that all your listeners say a
[02:51:20.080 --> 02:51:25.840]  prayer for you. You're really out there doing a good thing. Well, I get mad because it's like
[02:51:25.840 --> 02:51:29.680]  watching somebody cram their hand in a garbage disposal and turn it on. And even when their
[02:51:29.680 --> 02:51:34.480]  hand's chopped up saying, no, my hand's not chopped up. I mean, this new order is bad.
[02:51:34.480 --> 02:51:38.160]  And it is painful to watch it metastasize. Go ahead.
[02:51:39.760 --> 02:51:43.920]  The Saudi national, I don't want to get into the exact same things that y'all have been,
[02:51:43.920 --> 02:51:48.480]  but wasn't it, didn't Obama stop in his name and Michelle Obama stop in his name, correct?
[02:51:49.920 --> 02:51:53.200]  Yes, they acted very, very suspicious, but- Well, here's what I want to say.
[02:51:53.200 --> 02:51:55.280]  Now they found one of them dead in the lake. Yeah, go ahead.
[02:51:55.280 --> 02:51:59.600]  Yeah, Mr. President, I'm paying your salary. So I would really like to know what you were doing
[02:51:59.600 --> 02:52:04.000]  on the clock, stopping in. I want to know what the meeting was about because I paid your salary.
[02:52:04.000 --> 02:52:07.600]  And I think if we push it enough, we may not be able to get the answer that we want,
[02:52:07.600 --> 02:52:10.800]  but at least we'll heat them up and not have to give us some kind of answer.
[02:52:10.800 --> 02:52:13.920]  Let me ask you this question. Why do you think the Secret Service
[02:52:15.120 --> 02:52:19.120]  would go to a meeting that Obama and no other cabinet people are at
[02:52:19.120 --> 02:52:23.280]  and get in the face of a reporter that was going to bring up a drill?
[02:52:23.280 --> 02:52:27.520]  Well, I'll tell you exactly why, because I used to be on the other side of the fence.
[02:52:27.520 --> 02:52:32.640]  I used to be the one not making the right choices. When you flip like that, it's because you know
[02:52:32.640 --> 02:52:36.560]  you're in the wrong and the only way to stop the person in the right is to intimidate them.
[02:52:37.280 --> 02:52:42.480]  And that's it. I mean, if you use intimidation, if that doesn't work, you really get scared
[02:52:42.480 --> 02:52:46.080]  because most of the time those people aren't tough. That's why they need numbers. They're
[02:52:46.080 --> 02:52:53.840]  not tough. They don't know what real war is about. So if the intimidation doesn't work,
[02:52:54.400 --> 02:52:57.840]  basically we push them in a corner and they're in a bad shape.
[02:52:57.840 --> 02:53:00.800]  Well, no, they're going to blow stuff up and blame it on us. It's what they do.
[02:53:00.800 --> 02:53:06.160]  They were going to blame the Tea Party. It didn't work. And so now they fell back to Muslims. So
[02:53:06.160 --> 02:53:10.400]  they probably actually had plant the bombs. They were CIA, definitely the older brother.
[02:53:10.400 --> 02:53:14.960]  That's confirmed now. All over the map, he was one of their minions, not an agent,
[02:53:14.960 --> 02:53:22.320]  or quote, officer, as they call them. But they tried to then say, well, a foggy guy,
[02:53:22.320 --> 02:53:27.600]  here's his first name. He says Alex Jones made him do it. And then now they're on CNN.
[02:53:27.600 --> 02:53:33.200]  Imagine walking by in the coffee room and they're talking about, what's the name?
[02:53:33.200 --> 02:53:38.000]  I don't have the AP article in front of me. Chamis, Chamis, how do you say it?
[02:53:38.000 --> 02:53:45.520]  You're all, huh? Yeah, Chamis. And they've got it on screen. I've got the article right here.
[02:53:45.520 --> 02:53:52.720]  Let me find it. Yeah, Chamis says Alex Jones, in full words. I mean, it's like, come on, man.
[02:53:53.360 --> 02:53:57.360]  I expose them so they write me into it. What, are you going to find a
[02:53:57.360 --> 02:54:00.000]  cooker bomb at my house next to you, jackasses?
[02:54:00.000 --> 02:54:08.000]  Let's skip this network break. Let's talk to PJ in Boston on the Boston bombing,
[02:54:08.960 --> 02:54:12.400]  and insider trading. It's always important to look at insider trading,
[02:54:12.400 --> 02:54:15.680]  cuz they always do that when it's staged. I forgot to look at that telltale sign.
[02:54:15.680 --> 02:54:21.040]  We should create a checklist for people for false flags. Do they work for intelligence agencies?
[02:54:21.040 --> 02:54:25.200]  Was there a drill? Did law enforcement be told to stand down? All that's coming out.
[02:54:25.200 --> 02:54:31.360]  Did they have aliases? Did they try to kill the patsies? Maybe they can have Jack Ruby walk up to
[02:54:31.360 --> 02:54:37.520]  the other brother who's had his larynx cut out, and just have him go. And then they can kill Jack
[02:54:37.520 --> 02:54:47.600]  Ruby too. Maybe zombie Jack Ruby like, get rid of Patsy. I mean, how dumb do you have to be, people?
[02:54:47.600 --> 02:54:54.080]  I'm sorry. And this is not a Tetris effect here where you play Tetris long enough that
[02:54:54.080 --> 02:54:58.480]  it's called the Tetris syndrome. Everything looks like Tetris. It's not, I'm a hammer,
[02:54:58.480 --> 02:55:02.160]  everything's a nail. Believe me, I don't want this to be an inside job.
[02:55:03.680 --> 02:55:08.560]  It just happens to be that, and now I'm being connected to it. I told you they were gonna
[02:55:08.560 --> 02:55:14.640]  try to blame us for it. It's so funny. It's not funny though. I'm sorry, PJ, finish your point.
[02:55:14.640 --> 02:55:25.600]  All right. So, back in 2012, they signed into law the Stock Act. It basically shows Congress
[02:55:25.600 --> 02:55:30.720]  and how they're doing inside trading. It's supposed to disclose their financial information.
[02:55:31.360 --> 02:55:39.520]  But when the Boston bombing happened, at the same time, Obama signed into law the Stock Act,
[02:55:39.520 --> 02:55:45.680]  S-T-O-C-K Act rollback at the same time that the bombing was happening. So instead of us being
[02:55:45.680 --> 02:55:51.280]  able to see what their financial information is on the internet, now we can't. And I think they're
[02:55:51.280 --> 02:55:56.400]  getting bad now. I think we really need to see who's getting paid and who's not. We need to find
[02:55:56.400 --> 02:56:02.080]  out where the money's going at this point. No, no, no. Don't look into things. That's extreme.
[02:56:03.040 --> 02:56:05.920]  Sir, the government loves you. Have you had your shots today?
[02:56:05.920 --> 02:56:13.520]  Alex, I'm going to every bullion program and every single silver is delayed. All of them,
[02:56:13.520 --> 02:56:18.160]  10 ounce, 100 ounce, one ounce, it doesn't matter what it is, gold and silver, they're all delayed.
[02:56:18.160 --> 02:56:22.240]  I'm trying to get one right now. They're all delayed. They're all sold out.
[02:56:23.680 --> 02:56:29.440]  I don't know if Midas Resources is sold out of gold. No, no, since the price went down,
[02:56:29.440 --> 02:56:32.880]  the globalists are using that to buy it. And that's what I've been told is that gold's
[02:56:32.880 --> 02:56:37.600]  actually sales are way up. Cuz people just are actually understanding they used a paper market
[02:56:37.600 --> 02:56:42.960]  to drive it down. I haven't sold any gold or silver I had. Thank you so much. Great points, PJ.
[02:56:44.640 --> 02:56:49.040]  By the way, Steve Watson did a report. It's actually a serious report. Alert,
[02:56:49.040 --> 02:56:54.400]  Spider-Man linked with Boston bombers. Michael Jackson, Game of Thrones, Finding Nemo
[02:56:54.400 --> 02:56:59.520]  could also be involved. Because that was on their Facebook and other social media accounts.
[02:56:59.520 --> 02:57:06.160]  And since some foggy guy said they listened to me, it's my fault. So by extension,
[02:57:07.760 --> 02:57:14.400]  it's Spider-Man. Alert, Spider-Man linked with Boston bombers, Michael Jackson, Game of Thrones,
[02:57:14.400 --> 02:57:19.120]  Finding Nemo could also be involved, obviously. You know that fish, man, that fish acts friendly.
[02:57:20.960 --> 02:57:23.520]  You know the American people are like the fish that can't remember anything?
[02:57:24.560 --> 02:57:26.560]  Like it knows Nemo and she's always like, who are you again?
[02:57:26.560 --> 02:57:32.560]  Who are you again? Dory, yeah, I'm like, now the First Amendment says we have the right to
[02:57:32.560 --> 02:57:39.520]  religion and the government has no jurisdiction. Who are you again? Dory should be the new American
[02:57:39.520 --> 02:57:45.360]  mascot. You're kidding, they're coming out with a sequel calling Finding Dory?
[02:57:48.080 --> 02:57:56.160]  Wow, while she gets lost? Okay, that is a good movie. I'm telling you right now, folks,
[02:57:56.160 --> 02:57:59.280]  that we've thought is that the ostrich is the new American symbol?
[02:57:59.280 --> 02:58:05.040]  Is it a TSA officer shoving their hand up your rump? No, no, no, we need something more
[02:58:05.680 --> 02:58:10.800]  friendly. Dory will be the new national symbol and everyone will forget the American flag ever
[02:58:10.800 --> 02:58:15.360]  existed and that will be the new flag. But they won't even know what that is with all the fluoride.
[02:58:16.000 --> 02:58:20.880]  Is that not genius? The new American flag will be Dory. For people that don't know,
[02:58:20.880 --> 02:58:31.440]  can we pull up Dory? I love the sharks in that movie. It's like, hello there friend,
[02:58:31.440 --> 02:58:37.360]  yeah, the big smile. Let's go ahead, there you go. Here's Dory the blue fish, of course,
[02:58:37.360 --> 02:58:42.160]  you can't remember that. What is that? Is that a fish? Someday if you even know if something's
[02:58:42.160 --> 02:58:48.720]  a fish, you'll be like a genius. That man is a genius. He has an IQ of 52. He's able to breathe.
[02:58:48.720 --> 02:58:55.440]  Let's go ahead and talk to John in Colorado, shutting down the missile defense base,
[02:58:55.440 --> 02:58:59.520]  whatever that is. What's the missile defense base? Hello, who's the caller? Who did I say
[02:58:59.520 --> 02:59:04.560]  I was going to? Hello, hello? I love my government. I love my Obama. I love my free medical care,
[02:59:04.560 --> 02:59:08.880]  though it's not free. Hello, hello? He said he wouldn't raise my taxes. I'm sorry, go ahead.
[02:59:08.880 --> 02:59:15.280]  What's your name? Hey, Alex, John. Who are you? What? John. I'm sorry, I don't remember your
[02:59:15.280 --> 02:59:20.480]  name. What is it again? John. Okay, well, you're being a conspiracy theorist telling me you know
[02:59:20.480 --> 02:59:27.600]  how to talk. Go ahead. No. Hey, I have a friend of the family who's been working out at Buckley
[02:59:27.600 --> 02:59:32.320]  Air Force Base for 40 years. Father worked there, now the son works there. He works for a private
[02:59:32.320 --> 02:59:38.880]  defense contractor. They were told about a month and a half ago that Buckley Air Force Base,
[02:59:38.880 --> 02:59:42.800]  you're not familiar with, they're the huge golf balls when you fly into Denver International
[02:59:42.800 --> 02:59:48.000]  Airport, but they provide all the missile warning, missile defense, technology, all that basically
[02:59:48.000 --> 02:59:53.360]  homeland security stuff, but they were told that this division that runs the whole thing was told
[02:59:53.360 --> 02:59:58.000]  that they were going to shut down within the next two months. The mother was absolutely irate.
[02:59:58.800 --> 03:00:02.480]  The father said that the father had worked there for 35 years, so the United States
[03:00:02.480 --> 03:00:05.360]  will have absolutely no security whatsoever once this is closed down.
[03:00:05.360 --> 03:00:13.200]  I mean, I searched Buckley Air Force Base to close. It seems like I heard something about that,
[03:00:14.640 --> 03:00:19.040]  but has that not been announced yet? There's 92,000 people that work out there,
[03:00:19.040 --> 03:00:26.880]  so this is just a particular division that runs the satellite warning early missile defense system.
[03:00:26.880 --> 03:00:33.760]  And like I said, the father, without going into any detail,
[03:00:33.760 --> 03:00:36.880]  said we will have absolutely no defense warnings whatsoever.
[03:00:36.880 --> 03:00:41.760]  Well, he also might be compartmentalized. They've launched a bunch of floating ones.
[03:00:42.880 --> 03:00:46.160]  I mean, I was down at Corpus Christi a few years ago and watched this giant one launch,
[03:00:46.160 --> 03:00:50.880]  took photos of it, and then a year later saw it in National Geographic talking about the launch of it.
[03:00:51.920 --> 03:00:55.200]  But yeah, I saw some deal where they were saying they were going to not have missile defense as
[03:00:55.200 --> 03:01:01.360]  part of a deal with China on the West Coast. So of course, look, a government with nukes
[03:01:01.360 --> 03:01:06.400]  with missiles is not a threat. The threat is the veterans and gun owners and fathers.
[03:01:06.400 --> 03:01:11.920]  Yeah, there it is. May the force stay with us, protecting Buckley Air Force Base from closure.
[03:01:11.920 --> 03:01:18.880]  There's the Aurora Sentinel reporting on that. And it says they are shutting parts of it down,
[03:01:18.880 --> 03:01:22.880]  so there you go. Well, sir, we need the army to spy on tea partyers. I mean,
[03:01:22.880 --> 03:01:27.360]  did you not hear that it's all my fault the bombings now? It's gone from,
[03:01:27.360 --> 03:01:30.480]  I say we should look at the government. They go, really, Jones? You did it.
[03:01:32.960 --> 03:01:34.880]  What do you think of that? King Jones.
[03:01:35.920 --> 03:01:40.800]  Well, it's just I'm so powerful right now. And a quick question or comment about the
[03:01:40.800 --> 03:01:45.920]  Boston thing. I don't know if you saw this this morning, but came out that the public
[03:01:45.920 --> 03:01:49.840]  defender is going to be the same public defender that defended the shoe bomber.
[03:01:49.840 --> 03:01:56.880]  And that he also admitted to the crime before his read, his read his Miranda rights.
[03:01:58.080 --> 03:02:01.440]  Oh, no, no, yeah, yeah, no, they're coming out with a guy they chopped the throat out of
[03:02:01.440 --> 03:02:06.720]  right after he was fired. I'm fine. Oh, really? You're not fine now. Box cutters. And we'll take
[03:02:06.720 --> 03:02:11.040]  care of you, pal. And now he admits he's guilty. Well, you know why they're so desperate? Because
[03:02:11.040 --> 03:02:15.520]  it was an intelligence operation. Did you hear me that it's come out that Tamerlan was in a CIA
[03:02:15.520 --> 03:02:21.040]  program and he had aliases? This is confirmed about the alias stuff. I mean, they definitely
[03:02:21.040 --> 03:02:24.800]  set this up. Yeah, a shoe bomber lawyer to represent the Boston bombing suspect.
[03:02:24.800 --> 03:02:28.960]  The shoe bomber had an IQ of about 60 and tried a light plastic explosive.
[03:02:30.960 --> 03:02:33.920]  They're saying that she's excellent, tough, and tenacious. And why should it be one of the
[03:02:33.920 --> 03:02:38.320]  best defense lawyers that a man could get without paying for it? I just thought that was-
[03:02:38.320 --> 03:02:41.520]  Yeah, yeah. Well, if they ever set me up, that's not the one I want.
[03:02:41.520 --> 03:02:47.920]  It's like, this great white shark really protects you from sharks in the water now.
[03:02:48.880 --> 03:02:55.040]  Go stick your legs in its mouth. It'll take good care of you. Kangaroo courts, man. All right,
[03:02:55.040 --> 03:02:58.080]  thank you. Yeah, John brought that up. We were able to confirm everything he said.
[03:02:59.360 --> 03:03:05.920]  I'm out of time. I apologize to a lot. Lisha, Chris, Farouk, and Mike, I've got a giant headache
[03:03:05.920 --> 03:03:10.880]  now. And I'm gonna end the transmission. We're gonna go to rebroadcast after this break at the
[03:03:10.880 --> 03:03:16.400]  streams at m4wars.com. But the Nightly News is back tonight, 7 o'clock Central Standard Time.
[03:03:16.400 --> 03:03:19.280]  I think it'll be live tonight. We got a bunch of special reports that are gonna premiere,
[03:03:19.280 --> 03:03:24.000]  they've been working on for days. 7 o'clock Central, if you're not a prisonplanet.tv member,
[03:03:24.000 --> 03:03:29.680]  it will not cure your cancer. But it will, that's a joke, folks, a little inside joke.
[03:03:30.320 --> 03:03:35.600]  But it will help cure the tyranny. 11 memberships for 595. One membership,
[03:03:35.600 --> 03:03:40.720]  11 people can simultaneously log in with it. Get it, share it, get everybody to tune in tonight,
[03:03:40.720 --> 03:03:47.520]  7 o'clock Central, prisonplanet.tv. You can also, we're gonna stop tonight with the free
[03:03:47.520 --> 03:03:52.560]  video stream cuz the bill's too big, with m4wars.com forward slash listen. But still
[03:03:52.560 --> 03:03:58.640]  on that page will be the listen and some of the videos we'll post there. But I just can't pay for
[03:03:58.640 --> 03:04:04.400]  it. We got a big donor coming in, then we'll be able to have free video for everybody. We're
[03:04:04.400 --> 03:04:08.080]  trying to do an ad system to have ads on it, but it hadn't worked yet. So where we can pay to give
[03:04:08.080 --> 03:04:12.320]  you the daytime show at least free, cuz we wanna reach more people, that's the goal. But
[03:04:12.320 --> 03:04:16.160]  prisonplanet.tv support us. We're on the very front line, ladies and gentlemen,
[03:04:16.160 --> 03:04:38.960]  buy your war bonds for the five of the republic, m4wars.com.
