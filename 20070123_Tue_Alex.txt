[00:00:00.069 --> 00:00:00.750]  Find out right now!
[00:00:29.687 --> 00:00:31.070]  Thank you for listening to GQA.
[00:00:39.841 --> 00:00:44.685]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[00:00:44.685 --> 00:00:46.267]  You want answers?
[00:00:46.267 --> 00:00:47.828]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:47.828 --> 00:00:52.012]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:52.012 --> 00:00:56.135]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:01:06.596 --> 00:01:07.617]  Oh, yeah.
[00:01:15.885 --> 00:01:16.865]  Welcome, my friends.
[00:01:16.865 --> 00:01:17.305]  Welcome.
[00:01:17.305 --> 00:01:22.387]  Thank you so much for joining us as we start another three-hour transmission against tyranny.
[00:01:22.387 --> 00:01:25.707]  It is Tuesday, the 23rd day of January 2007.
[00:01:25.707 --> 00:01:32.149]  We're going to have open phones today and take a lot of your phone calls and cover the news.
[00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:41.171]  We have Hutton Gibson, who hasn't done a talk radio interview in over two and a half years, since the big Passion of the Christ controversy.
[00:01:42.200 --> 00:02:03.428]  He's coming on today, though, to talk about the Catholic Church and how it's been taken over by Masonic influences and what Ratzinger is doing when he calls for the New World Order, when he went to Turkey and prayed to Mecca, and much, much more, with Hutton Gibson joining us in the second hour.
[00:02:03.428 --> 00:02:11.171]  I am honored that Mr. Gibson and the Gibson family trust this show enough.
[00:02:12.264 --> 00:02:18.546]  That he would break his silence on this broadcast.
[00:02:18.546 --> 00:02:38.793]  And I was very pleased when I was contacted and told a few weeks ago that, and I talked to Hutton, that he was considering speaking out despite the media demonization and other things that he went through and the taking out of context statements
[00:02:39.694 --> 00:02:43.957]  Uh, that he'd made and then, well, people making up statements that he never had made.
[00:02:43.957 --> 00:02:52.624]  But again, he'll be joining us to talk about the Catholic Church, what the traditional Catholics are really saying.
[00:02:52.624 --> 00:02:57.407]  That is coming up in the second hour today.
[00:02:57.407 --> 00:03:01.370]  In the meantime, I don't know where to start with all this news.
[00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:07.635]  Paul Watson wrote an article yesterday about Mexican street gangs targeting blacks.
[00:03:09.717 --> 00:03:23.304]  And we have a message board, and I'd say about 30% of people in there were very mad at us, claiming that we were trying to be racist against Hispanics by simply reporting this.
[00:03:23.304 --> 00:03:27.666]  Folks, we're just trying to cover the news here.
[00:03:27.666 --> 00:03:29.587]  And the facts are the facts.
[00:03:29.587 --> 00:03:35.150]  It is a minority of Hispanics, but it is a large group of people
[00:03:36.016 --> 00:03:41.819]  Who say they want to kill all whites and all blacks.
[00:03:41.819 --> 00:03:48.122]  And the head of the University of Texas Chicano Studies at UT Arlington has given speeches.
[00:03:48.122 --> 00:03:49.802]  We've played clips of him in the past.
[00:03:49.802 --> 00:03:53.944]  He said all white males 16 and older need to be killed.
[00:03:53.944 --> 00:04:00.107]  Now he just says all whites need to be killed and it's been in the news.
[00:04:00.107 --> 00:04:01.568]  I have to report on this.
[00:04:03.631 --> 00:04:22.380]  Frankly, I'm a modern white male riddled with guilt over what whites have done in the past, but I've broken through that and I stand up against any and all forms of tribalism and racism that go on out there.
[00:04:22.380 --> 00:04:31.845]  I just don't understand the incredible denial that some people are engaging in
[00:04:33.030 --> 00:04:43.993]  When it comes to this subject, and the globalists couldn't be happier that they've got whites and blacks and Hispanics at each other's throats.
[00:04:43.993 --> 00:04:46.894]  So I'm going to break that down.
[00:04:46.894 --> 00:04:53.136]  Also, a couple weeks ago, Keith Olbermann did a commentary piece titled, Sacrifice, and
[00:04:54.685 --> 00:04:57.106]  I'd been so busy I'd never watched it.
[00:04:57.106 --> 00:05:02.509]  And he basically, he didn't basically, he came out and he said, Bush is engaging in human sacrifice.
[00:05:02.509 --> 00:05:05.811]  This is about human sacrifice.
[00:05:05.811 --> 00:05:07.672]  When he says sacrifice.
[00:05:07.672 --> 00:05:18.479]  And I wanted to dovetail that with a video analysis I did of occultic war memorials in Canada, the U.S., and England.
[00:05:18.479 --> 00:05:19.739]  So that's coming up too.
[00:05:19.739 --> 00:05:22.641]  A bunch of economic news, a bunch of Iran war news.
[00:05:23.496 --> 00:05:24.977]  A bunch of police state news.
[00:05:24.977 --> 00:05:28.778]  It's just... Huge broadcast coming up.
[00:05:28.778 --> 00:05:29.298]  Stay with us.
[00:05:29.298 --> 00:05:38.761]  The websites are PrisonPlanet.com, Infowars.net, and PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:05:38.761 --> 00:05:39.442]  It's here.
[00:05:39.442 --> 00:05:44.603]  After a year in production and traveling to distant lands, my new film, Terror Storm, is complete.
[00:05:44.603 --> 00:05:52.246]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[00:05:52.924 --> 00:06:00.366]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[00:06:00.366 --> 00:06:12.109]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, a White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[00:06:12.109 --> 00:06:16.070]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[00:06:16.070 --> 00:06:18.331]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[00:06:18.331 --> 00:06:22.172]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[00:07:35.487 --> 00:07:35.967]  Shall I?
[00:07:35.967 --> 00:07:37.328]  You look exu... Oh, wait!
[00:07:37.328 --> 00:07:38.428]  Why did you turn that down?
[00:07:38.428 --> 00:07:41.509]  I get so tired of that girl's squeaky voice.
[00:07:41.509 --> 00:07:46.190]  I'm sure the bed fan works, but that squeaky voice... Well, what's the bed fan?
[00:07:46.190 --> 00:07:48.871]  It's a fan that helps hot sleepers stay cool at night.
[00:07:48.871 --> 00:07:50.171]  I could use something like that.
[00:07:50.171 --> 00:07:52.632]  This menopause thing is really getting to me at night.
[00:07:52.632 --> 00:07:55.593]  And you know how I am about doing that hormone therapy thing.
[00:07:55.593 --> 00:07:57.493]  Besides, you're a hot sleeper yourself.
[00:07:57.493 --> 00:08:00.134]  You're always throwing the covers off in the middle of the night.
[00:08:00.134 --> 00:08:01.134]  I guess you're right.
[00:08:01.134 --> 00:08:01.994]  Why don't we try it?
[00:08:01.994 --> 00:08:03.955]  Just think how nice it'll be to sleep through the night.
[00:08:04.395 --> 00:08:08.778]  Yeah, and just think how nice it'll be this summer and all the money we can save on air conditioning.
[00:08:08.778 --> 00:08:10.859]  I know where we can get some more information.
[00:08:10.859 --> 00:08:15.442]  Sleep disorder centers across the country recommend that you must stay cool to get a good night's sleep.
[00:08:15.442 --> 00:08:18.984]  The BedFan will keep you cool and give you the restful sleep you deserve.
[00:08:18.984 --> 00:08:22.506]  With our 30-day 100% guarantee, you risk nothing.
[00:08:22.506 --> 00:08:23.586]  Are you a hot sleeper?
[00:08:23.586 --> 00:08:25.067]  Is your partner a hot sleeper?
[00:08:25.067 --> 00:08:26.608]  The BedFan is the answer.
[00:08:26.608 --> 00:08:30.250]  Visit us today at www.bedfan.com.
[00:08:30.250 --> 00:08:32.892]  That's www.bedfan.com.
[00:08:33.092 --> 00:08:35.314]  That's B-E-D-F-A-N-D-O-T.
[00:08:35.314 --> 00:08:40.719]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents The Alex Jones Show.
[00:08:40.719 --> 00:08:43.001]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[00:08:58.052 --> 00:09:05.118]  The European Union's gross domestic product has surpassed that of the United States.
[00:09:05.118 --> 00:09:12.965]  Its currency has dwarfed the value of the plunging dollar.
[00:09:12.965 --> 00:09:17.009]  The United States is now universally hated across the world.
[00:09:17.887 --> 00:09:28.549]  And I want to do a brief analysis on that subject, and I want to get into Keith Upperman's piece a few weeks ago about sacrificing the troops, because now we've got the numbers in, record numbers of U.S.
[00:09:28.549 --> 00:09:36.111]  troops dying on a daily basis, since a week and a half ago when they started putting in the first of 21,600 troops, mainly in Baghdad, and 16 unarmed, undefended substations.
[00:09:42.489 --> 00:09:48.954]  Every military strategist, even Neocon Oliver North said it was totally insane and would get all the troops killed.
[00:09:48.954 --> 00:09:50.235]  Well, you better believe it.
[00:09:50.235 --> 00:09:51.696]  It's a human sacrifice.
[00:09:51.696 --> 00:09:53.397]  The Aztecs killed their warriors.
[00:09:53.397 --> 00:09:54.878]  That was their favorite sacrifice.
[00:09:54.878 --> 00:09:59.322]  And believe me, folks, that is exactly what they're doing.
[00:09:59.322 --> 00:10:00.583]  Literally.
[00:10:00.583 --> 00:10:02.604]  This is a cultic.
[00:10:02.604 --> 00:10:04.746]  They believe they're getting power out of it.
[00:10:06.357 --> 00:10:08.539]  That's why Stalin and Hitler did what they did.
[00:10:08.539 --> 00:10:10.600]  It is a cultic sacrifice.
[00:10:10.600 --> 00:10:12.661]  And I'm sorry if you have trouble dealing with that.
[00:10:12.661 --> 00:10:18.385]  It's totally insane, but the people running things are insane.
[00:10:18.385 --> 00:10:20.567]  And anyone who's got a brain knows it.
[00:10:20.567 --> 00:10:22.548]  And Keith Olbermann knows it.
[00:10:22.548 --> 00:10:28.072]  But I want to go back to a piece we just put out for PrisonPlanet.tv members.
[00:10:28.072 --> 00:10:30.614]  Well, Part 1 went up last Friday.
[00:10:30.614 --> 00:10:32.175]  Part 2 went up yesterday.
[00:10:33.209 --> 00:11:02.101]  We took the footage I shot in England, footage I shot in Canada, never-before-seen stuff, footage we shot a few weeks ago in Austin, Texas, showing war memorials and police memorials, and they will always have the goddess Diana, or the several other goddesses, that's who the Illuminati mainly worships, is the goddess, looking down always on the memorial that will then list the numbers of dead, and that is a sacrifice to her.
[00:11:02.711 --> 00:11:04.072]  And I show it in Austin.
[00:11:04.072 --> 00:11:06.674]  I show it in Ottawa, Canada, in the capital.
[00:11:06.674 --> 00:11:08.356]  I show it in London.
[00:11:08.356 --> 00:11:19.045]  And anytime you see a big goddess riding a triumphant stallion or in a chariot, a lot of times it'll say, this is a sacrifice of the order of death.
[00:11:19.045 --> 00:11:20.526]  And it says that in England.
[00:11:20.526 --> 00:11:23.128]  It says the glorious order of death
[00:11:24.303 --> 00:11:27.585]  Uh, their sacrifice to the mother.
[00:11:27.585 --> 00:11:31.728]  And man, there's a giant goddess standing right over it with pleasure.
[00:11:31.728 --> 00:11:37.411]  Her eyes will be locked on the obelisk or on the tomb.
[00:11:37.411 --> 00:11:41.614]  And it is laid before her lovingly.
[00:11:43.286 --> 00:11:49.874]  The Texas Peace Officers Memorial behind the Capitol here in Austin is a giant black pentagram.
[00:11:49.874 --> 00:11:54.340]  It's just a huge black pentagram with two obelisks sticking out of the middle of it.
[00:11:55.557 --> 00:12:24.453]  uh... and with with a cultic uh... writing all over it i mean it's just it's just you're running along to the jungle in paraguay or something you came across it you'd say you'd found an ancient pagan monument but no it's just a police officer memorial it's no big deal big black pentagram uh... so we'll be talking about that because it dovetails into what hutton gibson uh... breaking the silence over two plus years joining us in the second hour will be discussing
[00:12:26.460 --> 00:12:34.223]  But right now, let me get into the collapse of the United States, and this is only the beginning.
[00:12:34.223 --> 00:12:52.310]  I remember old-timers, back when I was waking up 15 years ago, years before I got on air, they would say there's a plan to destroy our military, to debase it, to put our troops in all these foreign lands, and then incrementally they're going to merge our police with foreign police and military, and they're going to take down the United States.
[00:12:56.525 --> 00:12:58.986]  So many people got the documents.
[00:12:58.986 --> 00:13:01.326]  They had news articles going back to the 30s, 40s, 50s, 60s.
[00:13:01.326 --> 00:13:05.228]  You know, they weren't just crystal balling this.
[00:13:05.228 --> 00:13:07.568]  They knew.
[00:13:07.568 --> 00:13:10.029]  They understood what was happening.
[00:13:10.029 --> 00:13:14.370]  And you've heard many of them over the last 12 years on the show talk about it.
[00:13:14.370 --> 00:13:22.752]  And it's hard to believe, but it's hard to believe that 3.9 trillion will be missing from the Pentagon or that Dime Corp and Halliburton will be publicly running child kidnapping rings.
[00:13:22.752 --> 00:13:24.693]  And it'll be in the newspaper and no one will get in trouble.
[00:13:25.405 --> 00:13:32.930]  I mean, truth is stranger than fiction with these devils that we're talking about.
[00:13:32.930 --> 00:13:35.752]  So I want to start with the decline of the U.S.
[00:13:35.752 --> 00:13:39.595]  by getting into foreign troops.
[00:13:39.595 --> 00:13:51.883]  In plain view, they announced six years ago, and it was in the Washington Post and the Washington Times, that they weren't just hiring illegal aliens to then become
[00:13:55.845 --> 00:14:04.187]  naturalized immigrants who were getting green cards to join the military for three to five years stance and then get citizenship afterwards.
[00:14:04.187 --> 00:14:13.310]  And it said that the military was recruiting out of the prisons the illegal aliens who were aggravated felons and that they wanted aggravated felons.
[00:14:13.310 --> 00:14:17.011]  I made a pretty big deal out of that.
[00:14:17.011 --> 00:14:19.852]  And I think it's important.
[00:14:20.709 --> 00:14:48.506]  And then a few weeks ago the AP and the Boston Globe and others came out with headlines like military considering recruiting foreigners and then you read the first paragraph it said well they've already been doing it for years but now they're expanding it with recruiting stations in Manila, Mexico City, Ukraine everywhere and I'd seen the numbers that twenty percent plus of the ground forces in the army in Iraq were illegal alien
[00:14:50.085 --> 00:14:56.087]  Legalized via their signing up.
[00:14:56.087 --> 00:14:58.728]  And a lot of this is under hat, only some of it's public.
[00:14:58.728 --> 00:15:02.389]  And the stuff we know is just off the chart bad.
[00:15:02.389 --> 00:15:04.650]  So everybody needs to understand, the old timers were right.
[00:15:04.650 --> 00:15:13.153]  It isn't going to be Red Dawn with foreign troops parachuting down into school yards and cornfields.
[00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:21.445]  Or jumbo jets landing in major cities and the noses popping off and tanks rolling off with Russians, you know, leading Cuban forces.
[00:15:21.445 --> 00:15:22.545]  Uh-uh.
[00:15:22.545 --> 00:15:24.006]  It's our government.
[00:15:24.006 --> 00:15:38.054]  Like Kissinger said in 91, and Evy in France, to paraphrase, and you can pull the quote up online, he said Americans, you know, wouldn't put up with foreign troops in Los Angeles, UN troops, but they will if there's a big enough global crisis.
[00:15:38.054 --> 00:15:40.636]  They would willingly accept world government as their savior.
[00:15:43.220 --> 00:15:44.521]  That's basically word for word.
[00:15:44.521 --> 00:15:45.402]  It's a longer quote.
[00:15:45.402 --> 00:15:48.364]  Just go pull up Henry Kissinger foreign trip quote.
[00:15:48.364 --> 00:15:51.426]  It'll pop up.
[00:15:51.426 --> 00:15:54.028]  And then I remember four years ago.
[00:15:54.028 --> 00:15:55.049]  It's actually five.
[00:15:55.049 --> 00:15:55.589]  Time flies.
[00:15:55.589 --> 00:15:57.731]  I put it in Road to Tyranny in early 2002.
[00:15:57.731 --> 00:16:03.275]  I show the Associated Press where it says a deal was signed with Mexico and Canada for
[00:16:05.194 --> 00:16:07.136]  And you can pause the video and you can read it.
[00:16:07.136 --> 00:16:08.817]  It's up on the screen.
[00:16:08.817 --> 00:16:10.658]  Mainstream News.
[00:16:10.658 --> 00:16:15.922]  To quote, patrol America and deal with terrorists in the U.S.
[00:16:15.922 --> 00:16:18.584]  It says foreign groups will deal with Americans.
[00:16:18.584 --> 00:16:19.444]  Right there.
[00:16:19.444 --> 00:16:20.885]  Mainstream News.
[00:16:20.885 --> 00:16:31.373]  And then when they did the Defense Authorization Act a few months ago last year, it was in Army times that the President took over the Governors,
[00:16:32.370 --> 00:16:40.935]  It controls them, quote, during times of insurrection or rebellion or resistance, and a bunch of other terms, dealing with the American people.
[00:16:40.935 --> 00:16:47.378]  And it went on to say that in a mutual defense pact that they're going to use foreign troops in the US.
[00:16:47.378 --> 00:16:54.082]  And there were three articles in the newspaper, in the military newspaper, about this.
[00:16:54.082 --> 00:16:57.404]  I mean, this is just, this is wonderful, this is good.
[00:16:57.404 --> 00:16:58.824]  So, according to them.
[00:17:00.840 --> 00:17:14.308]  As a country, your country is gone when your military has a large, really any contingent, but a large contingent of foreign-born, non-U.S.
[00:17:14.308 --> 00:17:21.552]  citizen soldiers, a motley crew of former Eastern Bloc, of African, oh I forgot that part,
[00:17:23.045 --> 00:17:31.132]  Of Mexican, Guatemalan, Panamanian, Nicaraguan, I mean this is Brazilian, this is off the charts.
[00:17:31.132 --> 00:17:47.265]  And if you don't think they won't go house to house and try to take your guns, and if you don't think they won't load you on trucks, and if you don't think they won't bust a cap in you, and if you don't think these people that put American flags all over their cars made in China, again desecrated American flags, if you don't, they'll serve whatever the state says.
[00:17:47.265 --> 00:17:48.747]  Folks, a lot of these good old boys,
[00:17:49.347 --> 00:17:55.208]  They'll turn their guns in and they will march down at a parade as, uh, as, as, and of course they'll have U.S.
[00:17:55.208 --> 00:18:03.030]  troops leading the parade and on the loudspeakers, but leading huge foreign forces.
[00:18:03.030 --> 00:18:10.651]  Down the middle of our street these people will sit there and cry and salute them and run up and just lick their boots.
[00:18:10.651 --> 00:18:13.332]  In a New York minute.
[00:18:13.332 --> 00:18:14.612]  I'm not kidding when I say this.
[00:18:15.439 --> 00:18:19.940]  Already 20% of the Army Ground Force is illegal alien, mainly Mexican.
[00:18:19.940 --> 00:18:20.941]  Okay?
[00:18:20.941 --> 00:18:22.981]  Now they're setting up huge recruiting stations.
[00:18:22.981 --> 00:18:24.342]  They're expanding them.
[00:18:24.342 --> 00:18:29.783]  Again, in the Philippines, and in Eastern Europe, and in Africa, and in Latin America.
[00:18:29.783 --> 00:18:39.226]  I mean, they have huge, huge multi-million dollar ad buys with billboards, radio, and TV ads in Mexico City, and recruiting offices in Mexico City.
[00:18:42.111 --> 00:18:46.915]  And remember the footage we got in 95, 96, 97 Patriots got?
[00:18:46.915 --> 00:19:05.229]  We put it in our police state films of camps in Louisiana where it is Ukrainian troops and it is Czech Republic troops saying we love this training this is wonderful and the role players are saying I'm an American and they're practicing going house to house taking your guns
[00:19:06.644 --> 00:19:20.850]  And then I've been to urban warfare drills where Dutch troops, British troops, Israeli troops, French troops, other foreign troops are there running around with role players screaming, I'm an American, I have rights, don't take my guns, don't put me in a camp.
[00:19:20.850 --> 00:19:23.711]  I mean, I gave you video of it.
[00:19:23.711 --> 00:19:30.414]  The military talks about how they're going to execute Americans and they have them get on their knees as they practice blowing our heads off.
[00:19:30.414 --> 00:19:35.016]  I mean, you know, you can't make this type of stuff up.
[00:19:35.016 --> 00:19:36.257]  But people couldn't believe it.
[00:19:37.233 --> 00:19:48.479]  I still get emails saying I hired an aircraft carrier, the troop carrier, Coronado, and I hired helicopters and 3,000 Marines and 2,000 foreign troops and hovercraft and warrior fighting vehicles.
[00:19:48.479 --> 00:19:50.379]  That would be a $50 million budget.
[00:19:50.379 --> 00:19:51.880]  No, that's real.
[00:19:51.880 --> 00:19:55.782]  And you can go to the Marine Corps' website and read about Urban Warrior 99.
[00:19:55.782 --> 00:19:57.163]  But you won't do that.
[00:19:57.163 --> 00:20:03.106]  You'll just deny it and say it isn't real and say it isn't true, won't you?
[00:20:03.106 --> 00:20:04.126]  Fine.
[00:20:04.126 --> 00:20:05.107]  Fine.
[00:20:05.107 --> 00:20:05.827]  Just go right ahead.
[00:20:07.609 --> 00:20:14.231]  So when we get back, I'm going to just go over how they've destroyed our country in the world's eyes, all by design.
[00:20:14.231 --> 00:20:16.072]  All by design.
[00:20:16.072 --> 00:20:24.755]  And all you good old boys who think you're part of the power structure and think this is America's whooping up on some people, you couldn't be more wrong.
[00:20:24.755 --> 00:20:27.496]  The war in Iraq is more about destroying the U.S.
[00:20:27.496 --> 00:20:30.397]  in the world's eyes than it is anything else.
[00:20:30.397 --> 00:20:32.618]  But you aren't sophisticated enough to get that.
[00:20:37.023 --> 00:20:39.706]  Do you know the truth about cancer treatments?
[00:20:39.706 --> 00:20:49.175]  Do you realize that with all presently accepted methods, you are not correctly attacking the cancer, and you are mostly fighting to survive the treatment?
[00:20:49.175 --> 00:20:56.262]  Do you realize that mutilating surgery, burning, and the poisoning of your entire system are totally unnecessary?
[00:20:56.992 --> 00:21:02.956]  But now, it's cancer's turn to die with LaceMedInc's patented methodology.
[00:21:02.956 --> 00:21:14.543]  Without cutting, bleeding, drugs or damaging radiation, we can destroy skin cancer and breast tumors of any size without adverse side effects at our physician's office.
[00:21:14.543 --> 00:21:17.125]  Laser technology at its best.
[00:21:17.125 --> 00:21:18.545]  For more information, call 702-953-0267.
[00:21:23.089 --> 00:21:25.652]  Or visit www.lasemedinc.com.

[00:21:36.372 --> 00:21:39.654]  David J. Smith for Newswatch Magazine.
[00:21:39.654 --> 00:21:49.401]  Did you know that the Lenin School of Political Warfare has laid down a plan for a third world war that will destroy both Christianity and Communism at the same time?
[00:21:49.401 --> 00:21:56.366]  From the rubbles of this war, the Illuminati will establish their world government, prophesied in Revelation Chapter 13.
[00:21:56.366 --> 00:22:00.129]  Communism said they would pretend to collapse, and when America had begun to disarm,
[00:22:00.729 --> 00:22:07.135]  The combined communist world would launch a surprise attack and smash us with their clenched fists.
[00:22:07.135 --> 00:22:15.003]  We'd like to show you how these things are coming to pass by offering you an absolutely free one-year subscription to Newswatch Magazine.
[00:22:15.003 --> 00:22:16.464]  Just call our toll-free number 1-800-516-8736.
[00:22:22.129 --> 00:22:29.300]  That's 1-800-516-8736 to request your subscription.
[00:22:29.300 --> 00:22:30.461]  Call now.
[00:22:30.461 --> 00:22:33.205]  Operators are standing by to receive your call.
[00:22:34.534 --> 00:22:39.897]  Nuclear reactors provide economical energy, but would you be prepared during an accident?
[00:22:39.897 --> 00:22:48.242]  During nuclear disasters, great amounts of radioactive iodine are released into the atmosphere, which are then readily absorbed into the body.
[00:22:48.242 --> 00:22:55.306]  Medical course potassium iodate gives you virtually complete protection from the most feared consequence of a nuclear accident.
[00:22:55.486 --> 00:22:56.847]  Radioactive Poisoning.
[00:22:56.847 --> 00:23:02.930]  Potassium Iodate can protect against radioactive poisoning by filling the thyroid with good iodine.
[00:23:02.930 --> 00:23:08.132]  This shields the thyroid and prevents it from absorbing the harmful radioactive iodine.
[00:23:08.132 --> 00:23:17.276]  Potassium Iodate is better than the iodide form because it is not as likely to cause upset stomachs in children, the elderly, the sick, and pets.
[00:23:17.276 --> 00:23:22.139]  Order the official Potassium Iodate for only $24 and save $5 by calling New Millennium at

[00:23:34.033 --> 00:23:35.174]  Ted Anders from Formidas.
[00:23:35.174 --> 00:23:35.595]  January 23, 2007.
[00:23:35.595 --> 00:23:35.915]  Gold 642.
[00:23:35.915 --> 00:23:38.397]  Ounce gold coins are at 663, 334.05 for half and 167.02 for quarter.
[00:23:38.397 --> 00:23:39.518]  Ounce coins at 663, 334.05 and 167.02.
[00:23:39.518 --> 00:23:39.538]  1971.
[00:23:39.538 --> 00:23:40.860]  Nixon closes the gold window.
[00:23:40.860 --> 00:23:41.420]  Fiat currency.
[00:23:41.420 --> 00:23:41.500]  1920s.
[00:23:41.500 --> 00:23:43.242]  The German market explodes from 75 to 23 trillion.
[00:23:43.242 --> 00:23:43.282]  1995.
[00:23:43.282 --> 00:23:45.204]  Gold doubles against the Mexican peso. 1997.
[00:23:59.717 --> 00:24:02.600]  Gold increases 82% over the Indonesian rupee.
[00:24:02.600 --> 00:24:05.983]  In 1998, gold jumps two-thirds over the Russian ruble.
[00:24:05.983 --> 00:24:09.206]  2002, the Argentine peso loses a fifth of its value to gold.
[00:24:09.206 --> 00:24:14.572]  2006, the last superpower, the USA's mighty dollar, loses over half to gold and other raw goods.
[00:24:14.572 --> 00:24:15.993]  Could government let this happen?
[00:24:15.993 --> 00:24:17.955]  Without immediate backing, how much will it lose?
[00:24:18.235 --> 00:24:25.402]  Midas has Nick Bereshov's report covering the loss of purchasing power, fat tail events, bull market economic vulnerabilities, and gold-oil relationship.
[00:24:25.402 --> 00:24:27.203]  You've lost half of your purchasing power.
[00:24:27.203 --> 00:24:28.705]  Call 800-686-2237 before the rest disappears.
[00:24:28.705 --> 00:24:29.085]  That's 800-686-2237.
[00:24:41.391 --> 00:24:49.693]  The last-ditch effort to defend the Republic as it passes beneath the waves is taking place right now.
[00:24:49.693 --> 00:25:03.476]  If we can only admit who the enemy is and face the true crises, we may be able to salvage our beautiful, wonderful, 230-plus-year-old nation.
[00:25:03.476 --> 00:25:05.356]  The battle is now.
[00:25:05.356 --> 00:25:08.017]  This is an alarm for the entire planet.
[00:25:09.033 --> 00:25:13.234]  The United States is being destroyed by design from within.
[00:25:13.234 --> 00:25:18.455]  We are under siege from within and without.
[00:25:18.455 --> 00:25:23.676]  All the new order's plans are coming to fruition, unfolding today.
[00:25:23.676 --> 00:25:25.057]  Think about it.
[00:25:25.057 --> 00:25:34.459]  Foreign troops openly becoming a large portion of our military to domestically operate against the American people.
[00:25:37.071 --> 00:25:38.551]  This is incredible.
[00:25:38.551 --> 00:25:40.732]  Meanwhile, I have the BBC today.
[00:25:40.732 --> 00:25:41.672]  View of U.S.
[00:25:41.672 --> 00:25:43.873]  global role worsens.
[00:25:43.873 --> 00:25:44.833]  The view of the U.S.
[00:25:44.833 --> 00:25:48.635]  role in the world has deteriorated, both internationally and domestically.
[00:25:48.635 --> 00:25:59.898]  A BBC poll suggests the world survey conducted in 25 nations, including the U.S., found that three in four respondents disapprove of how Washington dealt with Iraq.
[00:25:59.898 --> 00:26:06.700]  The majority of the 26,318 respondents are disapproving of the way five other foreign policy areas have been handled.
[00:26:07.489 --> 00:26:13.354]  The poll released ahead of President Bush's State of the Union speech was conducted between November and January.
[00:26:13.354 --> 00:26:14.835]  The number of those who said the U.S.
[00:26:14.835 --> 00:26:20.480]  was a positive influence in the world fell in 18 nations polled in previous years.
[00:26:20.480 --> 00:26:23.402]  In those countries, 29% of the people said the U.S.
[00:26:23.402 --> 00:26:29.187]  had a positive influence, down from 36% last year and 40% two years ago.
[00:26:29.187 --> 00:26:32.510]  Across the 25 countries polled, 49% of respondents said the U.S.
[00:26:32.510 --> 00:26:34.511]  played a mainly negative role in the world.
[00:26:37.415 --> 00:26:49.460]  Also, I have a report here with the GDP of the Euro, of the European Union, for the first time.
[00:26:49.460 --> 00:26:55.383]  I think a higher GDP than the United States.
[00:26:55.383 --> 00:26:59.205]  It's gross domestic product, it's economy growing many times faster.
[00:27:01.334 --> 00:27:02.795]  This is happening right now.
[00:27:02.795 --> 00:27:04.636]  So let me break down how this happens.
[00:27:04.636 --> 00:27:08.738]  The International Crime Syndicate funded the communists.
[00:27:08.738 --> 00:27:10.079]  The system is not communist.
[00:27:10.079 --> 00:27:11.560]  It uses communists.
[00:27:11.560 --> 00:27:12.380]  It uses fascists.
[00:27:12.380 --> 00:27:15.942]  It uses anything centralized as one of their top strategists.
[00:27:15.942 --> 00:27:22.526]  Carol Quigley wrote in Tragedy and Hope, a 900 plus page book, in 1968.
[00:27:22.526 --> 00:27:30.431]  They funded the Soviets to take over areas of Europe and then the globalists could blame the Soviets
[00:27:31.667 --> 00:27:40.970]  For being the prime mover behind it, while the whole time they were financed and controlled by large central banks, the Rockefellers, Arm and Hammer, and the rest of these people.
[00:27:40.970 --> 00:27:52.094]  Just like David Rockefeller helped engineer the build-up of China, and brags about it in his autobiography, and brags about it in New York Times editorials.
[00:27:52.094 --> 00:27:56.956]  So they build up these totalitarian systems, whatever name you give them.
[00:27:56.956 --> 00:28:00.557]  They're totalitarian, authoritarian, tyrannical, despotic.
[00:28:01.841 --> 00:28:02.782]  Abusive.
[00:28:02.782 --> 00:28:04.263]  Imperious.
[00:28:04.263 --> 00:28:06.904]  Imperial.
[00:28:06.904 --> 00:28:13.648]  And they run them out until they collapse, taking over the next nations.
[00:28:13.648 --> 00:28:20.272]  That's the program of exploitation of the nation, to use it against the next country.
[00:28:20.272 --> 00:28:22.894]  And they are now doing that with the United States.
[00:28:24.733 --> 00:28:26.193]  They've always hated our middle class.
[00:28:26.193 --> 00:28:27.474]  They've always hated our free market.
[00:28:27.474 --> 00:28:36.356]  They hated the fact that, previous to the experiment with our Republic, a tiny handful of people controlled most of the wealth on the planet.
[00:28:36.356 --> 00:28:45.598]  That shifted to 4%, which sounds tiny, but is much larger than the current and previously, 4% than had half the world's wealth.
[00:28:45.598 --> 00:28:48.719]  We've now 4%, that is the U.S.
[00:28:48.719 --> 00:28:50.900]  population, only has about 30% of the wealth.
[00:28:50.900 --> 00:28:52.280]  It's being extracted from us.
[00:28:53.220 --> 00:29:17.229]  So it's a process of using us up, using up our military, breaking our military down, destroying the military's morale, making the troops serve three, four tours, then having the war be unjust, having Rupert Murdoch-owned newspapers internationally demonize the U.S., while domestically propagandizing the public that it's good to keep you in the trap just long enough until it's too late for you to stop it.
[00:29:18.897 --> 00:29:31.441]  That's important that the very same news syndicates demonize us internationally, and we're the big demon, the war's wrong, the WMDs were staged, it's all a lie, and then domestically, oh it's all good and everybody loves us and everything's fine.
[00:29:31.441 --> 00:29:45.565]  So the bankers get to sit back in Europe and London and New York while our military and our country's treasure and our blood is used to take over entire regions and destabilize entire regions, huge additional debts are run up,
[00:29:47.149 --> 00:30:09.575]  And so it's about opium, it's about trillions in oil, hundreds of billions in weapon sales, permanent bases, destabilizing regions, but it's more about a police state domestically driving us into total debt and demonizing us worldwide so the last lone superpower can then be knocked out and merged into a world parliamentary system.
[00:30:10.160 --> 00:30:10.940]  And that's what the U.N.
[00:30:10.940 --> 00:30:11.501]  and others are doing.
[00:30:11.501 --> 00:30:17.804]  They're demonizing the crimes and blaming all of the global agenda on U.S.
[00:30:17.804 --> 00:30:21.446]  neocons when they're just puppets of these people.
[00:30:21.446 --> 00:30:25.928]  I'll continue with how they've set us up for a fall.
[00:30:25.928 --> 00:30:27.329]  We're on the march.
[00:30:27.329 --> 00:30:29.850]  The empire's on the run.
[00:30:29.850 --> 00:30:32.532]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:36.167 --> 00:30:40.349]  I found this company online and they have this really unique variety of salt wellness products.
[00:30:40.349 --> 00:30:44.172]  I read some of the articles and ended up ordering this beautiful salt lamp.
[00:30:44.172 --> 00:30:48.534]  According to the company, they said that the salt crystal lamps gently purify indoor air.
[00:30:48.534 --> 00:30:49.495]  I was so amazed.
[00:30:50.987 --> 00:30:52.748]  And it made a perfect night light.
[00:30:52.748 --> 00:30:55.008]  Both my husband and I could tell the difference.
[00:30:55.008 --> 00:31:00.670]  Soleilwellness.com is a unique company that offers salt wellness products from around the world.
[00:31:00.670 --> 00:31:06.852]  So, I went back to the site and ordered their Soleil Simple Natural Cleaning Products, also made with Himalayan salt.
[00:31:06.852 --> 00:31:08.473]  I figured it would clean really well.
[00:31:08.873 --> 00:31:12.216]  And natural cleaning products worked wonderfully and there was no scent.
[00:31:12.216 --> 00:31:16.359]  This company has so many products my whole family can enjoy and feel better with.
[00:31:16.359 --> 00:31:18.180]  Plus, the service was great.
[00:31:18.180 --> 00:31:23.364]  If you're interested in natural homeopathic time-tested remedies, visit SoleilWellness.com.
[00:31:23.364 --> 00:31:26.686]  That's S-O-L-A-Y Wellness dot com.

[00:31:35.683 --> 00:31:38.066]  Attention, attention everyone!
[00:31:38.066 --> 00:31:40.709]  A brand new invention just released.
[00:31:40.709 --> 00:31:45.395]  It's called Wristease, the new patented portable ergonomic wrist support.
[00:31:46.053 --> 00:31:53.415]  Wristease comforts your wrists from the sometimes painful tasks of typing, writing, using a mouse or adding machine.
[00:31:53.415 --> 00:32:06.179]  Unlike most conventional wrist pads that are either attached to a mouse pad or lay flat in front of your keyboard, Wristease is totally portable and ideal for laptop users and technicians who are constantly on the go.
[00:32:06.739 --> 00:32:11.180]  Wristease is perfect for children doing homework or playing video games.
[00:32:11.180 --> 00:32:21.642]  Wristease provides the proper comfort and support for all ages and Wristease provides comfort for victims of carpal tunnel syndrome and other repetitive injuries.
[00:32:21.642 --> 00:32:25.042]  You can order Wristease now at Wristease.com.
[00:32:25.042 --> 00:32:26.683]  That's Wristease.
[00:32:26.683 --> 00:32:31.803]  W-R-I-S-T-E-A-S-E Wristease.com.
[00:32:31.803 --> 00:32:33.684]  Once again, Wristease.com.
[00:32:37.907 --> 00:32:38.907]  Pinch me, Bill.
[00:32:38.907 --> 00:32:40.288]  I can't believe it.
[00:32:40.288 --> 00:32:43.469]  A few months ago, I couldn't even afford gas for my car.
[00:32:43.469 --> 00:32:45.990]  And here we are with season tickets on the 50-yard line.
[00:32:45.990 --> 00:32:48.211]  I know what you mean, John.
[00:32:48.211 --> 00:32:52.933]  I remember the day you saw my new car and asked me if I robbed Bill Gates.
[00:32:52.933 --> 00:32:56.835]  Our lives sure have changed since we discovered DidYouRobBillGates.com.
[00:32:56.835 --> 00:32:58.855]  I was struggling to make ends meet.
[00:32:58.855 --> 00:33:04.057]  Now I've got a new car and a college fund for Lisa when she graduates from high school next year.
[00:33:04.057 --> 00:33:05.118]  And I owe it all to you.
[00:33:05.698 --> 00:33:09.080]  Because you told me about DidYouRobBillGates.com.
[00:33:09.080 --> 00:33:12.162]  Hey John, we all win when the money problems disappear.
[00:33:12.162 --> 00:33:13.703]  I want to tell everybody.
[00:33:13.703 --> 00:33:17.425]  Because the more people we have on the success team, the better it works.
[00:33:17.425 --> 00:33:19.387]  It's hard for the little guy these days.
[00:33:19.387 --> 00:33:22.168]  We pool our resources to level the playing field.
[00:33:22.168 --> 00:33:28.652]  So the more people that go to www.DidYouRobBillGates.com, the more cash for everybody.
[00:33:28.652 --> 00:33:29.453]  What a concept!
[00:33:49.481 --> 00:33:50.802]  I'll send an S.O.S.
[00:33:50.802 --> 00:33:52.563]  to the world!
[00:33:52.563 --> 00:33:59.207]  That's what we're doing right here, right now.
[00:33:59.207 --> 00:33:59.608]  Alright.
[00:34:17.717 --> 00:34:25.143]  John, Mark, Sam, Andrew, I'm going to get to you, but I'm going to move to you quickly because I've got a couple of clips I want to play and a lot of other news here.
[00:34:25.143 --> 00:34:32.349]  But everything the New World Order has done, and they put this in policy reports, it's even in their textbooks, it's break up the family for the good of the state.
[00:34:32.349 --> 00:34:33.950]  The family is a disease.
[00:34:33.950 --> 00:34:34.991]  Break down the border.
[00:34:34.991 --> 00:34:39.435]  Get everybody internally fighting with each other in the name of multiculturalism.
[00:34:39.435 --> 00:34:43.518]  It actually pronounces people's differences and actually gets you thinking about it.
[00:34:44.324 --> 00:34:50.751]  You see, everything they say, you know, the name says one thing, but the real action is 180 degrees.
[00:34:50.751 --> 00:34:52.473]  It's like calling it the Patriot Act.
[00:34:52.473 --> 00:34:55.317]  It's totally anti-patriotic.
[00:34:55.317 --> 00:35:00.803]  Or it's like calling it, you know, net neutrality, and then the bill actually ends freedom on the web.
[00:35:00.803 --> 00:35:02.545]  So they do a lot of that mislabeling.
[00:35:03.374 --> 00:35:07.318]  And at every point, they've done everything they can to shut down U.S.
[00:35:07.318 --> 00:35:08.139]  industry.
[00:35:08.139 --> 00:35:12.003]  Everything they can to move it offshore, which gives the multinationals the power.
[00:35:12.003 --> 00:35:13.004]  46!
[00:35:13.004 --> 00:35:14.805]  Please don't email me saying I said 44.
[00:35:14.805 --> 00:35:16.307]  The number now changed.
[00:35:16.307 --> 00:35:17.468]  It's worse.
[00:35:17.468 --> 00:35:19.710]  I know for a couple years I've been saying 44.
[00:35:19.710 --> 00:35:20.951]  That's Forbes.
[00:35:20.951 --> 00:35:23.794]  Of the biggest 100 economies, were corporations.
[00:35:23.794 --> 00:35:25.195]  Now it's 46.
[00:35:25.195 --> 00:35:26.477]  They are governments.
[00:35:28.089 --> 00:35:30.051]  This is what Libertarians don't get, a lot of them.
[00:35:30.051 --> 00:35:32.834]  They say, well, we've just got to leave corporations alone, it's free market.
[00:35:32.834 --> 00:35:34.315]  No, they don't operate in free market.
[00:35:34.315 --> 00:35:35.997]  They operate in monopolies.
[00:35:35.997 --> 00:35:43.243]  They have become governmental, and they lobby government to then bequeath to them, or advocate to them, governmental powers.
[00:35:43.243 --> 00:35:48.929]  It's neo-feudal, mercantile fascism.
[00:35:48.929 --> 00:35:52.112]  And the neolibs and neocons are all on the same team.
[00:35:53.061 --> 00:35:58.485]  And they've done everything they can to unravel this society and destroy our morals and destroy our fiber.
[00:35:58.485 --> 00:36:04.050]  People out there think they're trendy and cool and think, what do you mean morals to destroy our morals to make us weak?
[00:36:04.050 --> 00:36:05.451]  What's that mean?
[00:36:05.451 --> 00:36:08.133]  I'm talking about morals of standing up against corruption.
[00:36:08.133 --> 00:36:09.534]  Morals of getting angry.
[00:36:09.534 --> 00:36:15.639]  Morals of willing to get in a fight when somebody does you wrong or tries to take your liberty.
[00:36:15.639 --> 00:36:20.163]  I mean, when you don't have morals, you're just a bunch of slack-jawed, bug-eyed fools!
[00:36:21.904 --> 00:36:24.006]  A bunch of jackasses.
[00:36:24.006 --> 00:36:25.507]  And that's what they've turned us into.
[00:36:25.507 --> 00:36:27.629]  A bunch of self-centered people.
[00:36:27.629 --> 00:36:30.531]  If you really care about yourself, you care about others.
[00:36:30.531 --> 00:36:34.694]  Because you know if somebody else is being abused, you can be abused.
[00:36:34.694 --> 00:36:37.036]  So they've basically dismantled the country.
[00:36:37.036 --> 00:36:38.597]  Now they've puffed the bubble up.
[00:36:38.597 --> 00:36:40.399]  They've devalued the dollar.
[00:36:40.399 --> 00:36:43.721]  They have gotten public, private, corporate.
[00:36:43.721 --> 00:36:45.282]  Everything is at record levels of debt.
[00:36:45.282 --> 00:36:47.965]  Higher level than debt in any time in U.S.
[00:36:47.965 --> 00:36:48.545]  history.
[00:36:48.545 --> 00:36:49.786]  We broke the record in the middle of 2006.
[00:36:51.647 --> 00:37:01.974]  Previously, the record personal debt, which was a negative debt load on average, we're more in debt than the average person is, has a negative balance.
[00:37:01.974 --> 00:37:06.276]  The previous record was late 1933, the depths, four years in to a depression.
[00:37:12.637 --> 00:37:25.762]  It's amazing, but they can't pop the bubble completely until their police state is in place, and until everybody's watched 24, where they torture children almost every episode, and secret police arrest everyone, and there's concentration camps.
[00:37:25.762 --> 00:37:37.727]  See, all these shows, CSI, all of them just brainwashing, there's dozens of them, that condition you that the good guys wear black and they torture people, and the secret arrest, and cameras are everywhere, and it keeps us safe.
[00:37:38.527 --> 00:37:50.716]  They can't move fully to implode their economy totally and move into their next phase until they think you're sold on going along with it when they pull the rug out from under us.
[00:37:50.716 --> 00:38:00.322]  And, I mean, again, for every bureaucrat listening, every cop listening, every person who's been on a power trip and been part of this system, you better check out my claims, because I'm telling you the truth.
[00:38:00.322 --> 00:38:01.143]  And I'm your friend.
[00:38:01.767 --> 00:38:21.912]  And I know most of you aren't bad, you're just misguided, but I'm telling you right now that the people that are running our country killed 60 million people conservatively in Russia, 60 million conservatively in China, and Hitler killed between 20 and 30 million.
[00:38:21.912 --> 00:38:26.033]  If you count 12 million Germans, it's really over that.
[00:38:26.033 --> 00:38:26.993]  I don't know what to say here.
[00:38:27.918 --> 00:38:30.387]  I mean, these people like to kill.
[00:38:30.387 --> 00:38:33.678]  These people get into being the most hardcore ruthless.
[00:38:34.364 --> 00:38:36.745]  Their religion is about being totally ruthless.
[00:38:36.745 --> 00:38:42.168]  They look at people like myself and you out there that have morals and have empathy and care about others.
[00:38:42.168 --> 00:38:44.810]  They talk about how we're weak, how we're stupid.
[00:38:44.810 --> 00:38:46.371]  They believe it's survival of the fittest.
[00:38:46.371 --> 00:38:50.773]  They believe that it's their right to rule us because they don't have a conscience.
[00:38:50.773 --> 00:38:54.855]  It is a guild of psychopaths who now run the planet.
[00:38:54.855 --> 00:39:01.159]  They're going after the last rogue sovereign nations, shutting them down, attacking them, sanctions, invasions.
[00:39:01.960 --> 00:39:05.542]  And they are attacking our families, our culture, we are all under attack.
[00:39:05.542 --> 00:39:15.968]  Whether you're a black man in South Africa, or a white man in Germany, or a Jew in Israel, or a Mexican in Mexico, we are all together.
[00:39:15.968 --> 00:39:20.631]  We are all under attack by the New World Order.
[00:39:20.631 --> 00:39:25.494]  And you've got these Mexican drug gangs, and I've been on their websites, I've seen their spray paint here in Austin,
[00:39:26.890 --> 00:39:30.356]  The head of UT Chicano Studies says kill all whites.
[00:39:30.356 --> 00:39:32.920]  They call blacks Mayottas, which means black bird.
[00:39:34.695 --> 00:39:57.387]  And it's a big minority group, of that minority, I'm not saying it's all, but the media just loves the fact that they're now all at each other's throats, that we're Balkanized, and they've got big plans for the little Reconquista movement, that's why the media tries to keep it quiet, and tries to suppress the knowledge of it until it's too late.
[00:39:57.387 --> 00:40:01.669]  The globalists can do anything to bring in the foreign troops, who are already joining our military in Nash.
[00:40:02.492 --> 00:40:03.393]  Being recruited.
[00:40:03.393 --> 00:40:08.356]  They can stage race riots, economic collapses, nuke attacks, they can do anything.
[00:40:08.356 --> 00:40:09.817]  And they may do all three.
[00:40:09.817 --> 00:40:11.278]  They may release a bioweapon.
[00:40:11.278 --> 00:40:13.680]  The government's saying all that is going to happen.
[00:40:13.680 --> 00:40:17.323]  And then, don't worry, they'll take all your rights when it does to keep you safe.
[00:40:17.323 --> 00:40:21.065]  And, uh, it's time to get real.
[00:40:21.065 --> 00:40:26.289]  It's time to get real about what's happening systematically.
[00:40:26.289 --> 00:40:27.850]  Let's go to, uh, John.
[00:40:27.850 --> 00:40:28.771]  John, where are you calling from?
[00:40:30.939 --> 00:40:33.361]  Hi Alex, this is John from Magnolia.
[00:40:33.361 --> 00:40:34.482]  How you doing?
[00:40:34.482 --> 00:40:36.443]  Did you get my videotapes I sent you?
[00:40:36.443 --> 00:40:37.384]  Yes I did.
[00:40:37.384 --> 00:40:38.045]  Thank you.
[00:40:38.045 --> 00:40:41.127]  In old films they talk about the New World Order.
[00:40:41.127 --> 00:40:41.847]  We're going to use it.
[00:40:41.847 --> 00:40:42.568]  Thank you.
[00:40:42.568 --> 00:40:43.148]  Okay.
[00:40:43.148 --> 00:40:46.651]  I wanted to talk about the New World Order, what's going to happen.
[00:40:46.651 --> 00:40:50.774]  I think you're right that there's not going to be a Red Dawn invasion.
[00:40:50.774 --> 00:40:54.277]  There's going to be a Red Dawn Invitation.
[00:40:54.277 --> 00:40:55.398]  One of the reasons I think they
[00:40:56.027 --> 00:40:59.208]  That they started this Iraq War to get most of our troops out of the country.
[00:40:59.208 --> 00:41:00.809]  Well, that's how it happened in Germany.
[00:41:00.809 --> 00:41:04.210]  A lot of the countries, four or five of them, they took over.
[00:41:04.210 --> 00:41:06.151]  There was no military invasion.
[00:41:06.151 --> 00:41:10.712]  They just staged coups and took over the governments and then invited them in.
[00:41:10.712 --> 00:41:14.754]  Oh, these troops are here for security and here to fight the terrorists.
[00:41:14.754 --> 00:41:17.135]  Yeah, and the people are going to welcome them as saviors.
[00:41:17.135 --> 00:41:18.916]  They're coming in here to help us in our need.
[00:41:18.916 --> 00:41:22.497]  And if you resist them, you're going to be the ones that are going to be the enemy.
[00:41:22.497 --> 00:41:25.298]  Well, the Soviets did the same thing in a score of countries.
[00:41:27.250 --> 00:41:32.473]  Well, I think that's the same game plan they're using now, because they're stripping our National Guard and Reserves.
[00:41:32.473 --> 00:41:40.297]  The troops that are supposed to be here to defend us, they're being shipped out to Iraq, so there ain't gonna be nobody here, mostly, to stop them.
[00:41:40.297 --> 00:41:41.257]  Listen!
[00:41:41.257 --> 00:41:47.161]  They say that by 2010, the majority of infantry, army, ground forces will be foreigners.
[00:41:47.161 --> 00:41:47.821]  You can't!
[00:41:47.821 --> 00:41:50.222]  That is mainstream news!
[00:41:50.222 --> 00:41:51.703]  I mean, that is off the chart!
[00:41:52.622 --> 00:41:58.267]  The other thing I wanted to say is that nobody's been watching our Canadian border and my friend lives right on the Canadian border.
[00:41:58.829 --> 00:42:01.711]  He said that Chinese are pouring out of Canada into the United States.
[00:42:01.711 --> 00:42:08.235]  Yeah, China has unlimited, excuse me, Canada has unlimited, unfettered immigration.
[00:42:08.235 --> 00:42:18.021]  I was there when I got pulled out of line to be interrogated in Ottawa last June at the Bilderberg meeting, and I literally watched the Chinese with their Chinese passports who were immigrating.
[00:42:18.021 --> 00:42:20.483]  They just flashed them, boom, they were in.
[00:42:20.483 --> 00:42:23.505]  And yeah, they're just pouring across into this country.
[00:42:23.505 --> 00:42:26.607]  But don't worry, it's easy to get in, now it's hard to get out.
[00:42:28.772 --> 00:42:32.400]  Roaches come in, they can't get out.
[00:42:32.400 --> 00:42:34.245]  Remember those old ads for the roach motels?
[00:42:35.217 --> 00:42:41.221]  Yeah, but he says that they're buying a lot of boats abandoned on the shoreline of the Detroit River and the St.
[00:42:41.221 --> 00:42:48.466]  Clair River, and what they figure is they're buying a boat, they're stealing them, loading them up, coming over here, and then just leaving them and moving on inside the United States.
[00:42:48.466 --> 00:42:49.867]  Well, there's no figuring about it.
[00:42:49.867 --> 00:42:51.788]  They open containers up every day full of Chinese.
[00:42:51.788 --> 00:42:53.409]  There's ships coming in every night.
[00:42:53.409 --> 00:42:58.313]  I told them it's the People's Liberation Army coming across Peaceville, and for all we know, it probably is.
[00:42:58.313 --> 00:42:59.153]  Well, no, it is.
[00:42:59.153 --> 00:43:04.657]  There's 6,000-plus State Department admits of Chinese front companies in the U.S.
[00:43:05.849 --> 00:43:07.771]  And it's just unbelievable.
[00:43:07.771 --> 00:43:17.198]  But don't worry, the cops are going to arrest you for jaywalking, or they're going to interrogate your kids in school about what's in your medicine cabinet, and they've got cameras in the bathrooms.
[00:43:17.198 --> 00:43:24.044]  Don't worry, they'll thumb scan you for your lunch, but illegal aliens, they don't have to show any ID to get a housing loan or bank account.
[00:43:24.044 --> 00:43:25.766]  You see, it's a sick joke.
[00:43:25.766 --> 00:43:27.707]  Thanks for the call.
[00:43:27.707 --> 00:43:31.850]  Mark, where are you calling from?
[00:43:31.850 --> 00:43:32.951]  He's got his... Go ahead, sir.
[00:43:32.951 --> 00:43:33.572]  Turn your radio off.
[00:43:36.292 --> 00:43:36.972]  Okay, let him go.
[00:43:36.972 --> 00:43:39.054]  I'm sorry, Mark, but you've got to be ready when we go to you.
[00:43:39.054 --> 00:43:42.235]  Sam, where are you calling us from today?
[00:43:42.235 --> 00:43:43.616]  Yes, sir.
[00:43:43.616 --> 00:43:44.997]  God bless you, Alex Jones.
[00:43:44.997 --> 00:43:47.178]  This is Sam from Chesapeake, Virginia.
[00:43:47.178 --> 00:43:48.259]  Welcome.
[00:43:48.259 --> 00:43:52.561]  I really enjoyed that speech you gave at the Bilderberg meeting.
[00:43:52.561 --> 00:44:04.528]  I told my friend that got me started on a lot of this intelligence background stuff that I thought you were preaching better than just about any preacher I've ever heard, so God bless you for that, for standing up for us.
[00:44:06.565 --> 00:44:08.206]  I just want to go back for a minute.
[00:44:08.206 --> 00:44:16.631]  I first started, my eyes first started coming open when I read Jim Garrison's book, On the Trail of the Assassins.
[00:44:16.631 --> 00:44:20.653]  And then after I read that book, I found out about Colonel Proddy's website.
[00:44:21.590 --> 00:44:23.392]  Yes, he was actually a black operator in one of his
[00:44:37.495 --> 00:44:44.843]  He was the highest echelon black operator in that section of the Pentagon, and they told him that he wasn't going to be involved in this op.
[00:44:44.843 --> 00:44:46.045]  Exactly.
[00:44:46.045 --> 00:44:51.370]  And then my friend told me about your website, and from then on I've been doing my own.
[00:44:51.370 --> 00:44:55.195]  But one of the greatest books I ever read about that was Craig Roberts.
[00:44:55.875 --> 00:44:58.497]  Author of Killzone, A Sniper Looks at Dealey Plaza.
[00:44:58.497 --> 00:45:00.839]  Yeah, the Medusa files are a good friend of mine.
[00:45:00.839 --> 00:45:02.460]  I'm reading the Medusa file now.
[00:45:02.460 --> 00:45:04.201]  My friend gave that to me.
[00:45:04.201 --> 00:45:06.723]  We sell them all at InfoWars.com, by the way.
[00:45:06.723 --> 00:45:09.525]  Yeah, I got your video, Masters of Terror.
[00:45:09.525 --> 00:45:10.185]  Yes, sir.
[00:45:10.185 --> 00:45:17.030]  And I've shown it, and some people won't even look at it, Alex, but I go through the same thing you go through.
[00:45:17.030 --> 00:45:21.453]  And I try, as a Christian, you know, because I know there's no other hope.
[00:45:22.307 --> 00:45:31.675]  Because we know the god of this world that have blinded men's eyes are the real gods for these Illuminati cutthroats that you've been to.
[00:45:31.675 --> 00:45:39.642]  And thank you for explaining that yesterday about the real people in the background of the New World Order.
[00:45:39.642 --> 00:45:40.423]  Well, thank you, sir.
[00:45:40.423 --> 00:45:41.924]  I appreciate your kind words.
[00:45:41.924 --> 00:45:43.425]  Take care, Sam.
[00:45:43.425 --> 00:45:44.006]  Who's up next?
[00:45:44.006 --> 00:45:44.246]  Andrew?
[00:45:44.246 --> 00:45:45.827]  Andrew, where are you calling from?
[00:45:45.827 --> 00:45:47.529]  Yeah, hi, Alex.
[00:45:47.529 --> 00:45:48.810]  Where are you calling from?
[00:45:48.810 --> 00:45:49.651]  Missouri.
[00:45:49.651 --> 00:45:49.971]  Welcome.
[00:45:50.743 --> 00:45:53.704]  Yeah, I got a question and a comment.
[00:45:53.704 --> 00:45:55.145]  First of all, there's a question.
[00:45:55.145 --> 00:45:59.307]  Have you seen the new Popular Mechanics book that came out?
[00:45:59.307 --> 00:46:00.408]  It's got a forward of it.
[00:46:00.408 --> 00:46:01.108]  Yes, I have.
[00:46:01.108 --> 00:46:03.749]  It's Total Lies and Straw Men, All Propaganda.
[00:46:03.749 --> 00:46:07.291]  Hearst Publishing is the first known intelligence agency front.
[00:46:07.811 --> 00:46:08.312]  I think so.
[00:46:24.492 --> 00:46:35.595]  Staging the propaganda, the movie Rosebud, that got Orson Welles blackballed is all about, William Randolph Hearst, and it got complete.
[00:46:35.595 --> 00:46:37.075]  It's an absolute joke.
[00:46:37.075 --> 00:46:43.297]  Homeland Security Director's first cousin wrote the hit piece on me in Popular Mechanics.
[00:46:43.297 --> 00:46:44.077]  It's all lies.
[00:46:44.677 --> 00:46:47.418]  Yeah, it's got a forward in there by John McCain.
[00:46:47.418 --> 00:46:48.438]  Yeah, attacking me.
[00:46:48.438 --> 00:46:49.258]  It's all lies.
[00:46:49.258 --> 00:46:51.739]  In fact, on the left side, he's attacking me by name.
[00:46:51.739 --> 00:46:53.219]  And McCain, just go ahead and do that.
[00:46:53.219 --> 00:46:53.639]  That's fine.
[00:46:53.639 --> 00:46:56.620]  We're not going to stop defending the country from that traitor.
[00:46:56.620 --> 00:46:57.420]  Yeah.
[00:46:57.420 --> 00:47:03.062]  And the second one, Jack Blood was talking about Nicola Machiavelli, the prince.
[00:47:04.211 --> 00:47:07.433]  And I just want to recommend that book to everybody out there.
[00:47:07.433 --> 00:47:09.354]  It talks about foreign troops and everything.
[00:47:09.354 --> 00:47:11.976]  You know, just basic systems of government.
[00:47:11.976 --> 00:47:13.757]  And what was that written in, 1530 or something?
[00:47:13.757 --> 00:47:16.699]  32, I think it was.
[00:47:16.699 --> 00:47:20.782]  Yeah, I read that when I was 15, and it's pretty important people ought to read that.
[00:47:20.782 --> 00:47:21.182]  Yeah.
[00:47:21.182 --> 00:47:22.103]  You wrote two books, though.
[00:47:22.103 --> 00:47:23.804]  You ought to read both of them.
[00:47:23.804 --> 00:47:24.904]  What's the other one?
[00:47:24.904 --> 00:47:25.445]  I forget.
[00:47:25.445 --> 00:47:28.307]  I read the other one when I was like 18.
[00:47:28.307 --> 00:47:29.908]  Alright, thanks.
[00:47:29.908 --> 00:47:31.469]  Anything else you'd like to add?
[00:47:31.469 --> 00:47:32.049]  No, thanks.
[00:47:32.049 --> 00:47:33.250]  Alright, I appreciate your call.
[00:47:35.942 --> 00:47:48.308]  Yeah, Machiavelli, which they teach at the Chicago school where all these neocons got trained, it's Machiavelli forwards and backwards.
[00:47:48.308 --> 00:47:52.010]  And they teach Delta Force Machiavelli in their graduation.
[00:47:52.010 --> 00:47:54.611]  And it justifies the means.
[00:47:54.611 --> 00:47:58.113]  You say you're good, so now you're going to be more evil than anyone.
[00:47:58.113 --> 00:48:00.294]  Oh, because we're good, we're going to do evil.
[00:48:00.294 --> 00:48:03.776]  Or because other people are going to be evil, we've got to be more evil than them to protect the good.
[00:48:04.491 --> 00:48:05.491]  That's a fraud and a lie.
[00:48:05.491 --> 00:48:07.352]  You're just flat evil.
[00:48:07.352 --> 00:48:09.172]  You're just flat evil.
[00:48:09.172 --> 00:48:14.834]  You know, when you start compromising, like, you know, I can say I'm going to fight against the New World Order, so I'm going to fight dirty.
[00:48:14.834 --> 00:48:16.715]  No, I'm not going to fight dirty.
[00:48:16.715 --> 00:48:25.497]  Because once you start down that road, once you start down the path of the dark side, once you stick your toe in it, man, pretty soon you're over your eyeballs in it.
[00:48:29.986 --> 00:48:31.287]  We're in a lot of trouble, folks.
[00:48:31.287 --> 00:48:32.989]  We're in a lot of trouble.
[00:48:32.989 --> 00:48:36.752]  Tell you what, in the third hour, because Hutton Gibson's coming up, I want to continue with calls after this break.
[00:48:36.752 --> 00:48:47.522]  In the third hour, I'm going to play the Overman part about human sacrifice, how the war is really human sacrifice, and then dovetail it with some research I did.
[00:48:48.567 --> 00:48:49.467]  And continue with the calls.
[00:48:49.467 --> 00:48:50.687]  I've got a bunch of other news here.
[00:48:50.687 --> 00:48:52.868]  But right now, let's go ahead and play that clip from CNN.
[00:48:52.868 --> 00:49:00.490]  Because after we wrote this article yesterday, CNN had a piece last night about the race killings going on in L.A.
[00:49:00.490 --> 00:49:02.610]  I wanted to play this and then analyze it after the break.
[00:49:02.610 --> 00:49:04.250]  So let's play part of it now.
[00:49:04.250 --> 00:49:07.511]  Major offensive against the racial and violent.
[00:49:07.511 --> 00:49:13.832]  It comes just weeks after the killing of a 14-year-old black girl, allegedly by Latino gang members.
[00:49:13.832 --> 00:49:16.293]  Ted Rollins brings us the very latest on that tonight.
[00:49:17.561 --> 00:49:23.826]  This Los Angeles street is a deadly symbol of a racial divide between blacks and Latinos.
[00:49:23.826 --> 00:49:29.732]  I've been over here for 11 years, and I ain't never really crossed the 206th Street.
[00:49:29.732 --> 00:49:31.573]  206th Street is a dividing line.
[00:49:31.573 --> 00:49:41.321]  Darren Brown, who lives on 208th, says he and other African Americans stay on one side, Latinos are on the other, and if you cross, there can be trouble.
[00:49:41.321 --> 00:49:41.682]  If you do,
[00:49:42.502 --> 00:49:43.303]  You got a death wish.
[00:49:43.303 --> 00:49:44.924]  They're gonna take you out.
[00:49:44.924 --> 00:49:46.124]  They're gonna kill you.
[00:49:46.124 --> 00:49:50.187]  14-year-old Cheryl Green was recently murdered along the 206th Street border.
[00:49:50.187 --> 00:49:54.069]  The suspects, both Latinos, are facing hate crime charges.
[00:49:54.069 --> 00:49:59.652]  A week before Cheryl Green, it was 34-year-old Arturo Mercado who was shot in his front yard.
[00:49:59.652 --> 00:50:09.097]  Police haven't made an arrest in that case, but Latinos are blaming blacks who they claim started this war by moving into the neighborhood about 15 years ago.
[00:50:09.097 --> 00:50:10.338]  The dividing line is this street.
[00:50:10.758 --> 00:50:10.998]  L.A.
[00:50:10.998 --> 00:50:17.720]  Assistant Police Chief Charles Beck claims much of the tension on a Latino gang called 204.
[00:50:17.720 --> 00:50:27.764]  He says the gang is motivated by hatred of blacks to the point that the gang's mission, according to the police, is to get African Americans to leave the neighborhood.
[00:50:27.764 --> 00:50:31.305]  These police photos show some of the gang's recent hate graffiti.
[00:50:31.305 --> 00:50:34.806]  This message says, move, followed by the n-word.
[00:50:34.806 --> 00:50:38.327]  This gang, in a very small area, with a very small membership,
[00:50:38.988 --> 00:50:46.095]  has managed to put itself at the very top of our enforcement priority because they target people based on race.
[00:50:46.095 --> 00:50:49.279]  So why do these Latino gang members hate blacks?
[00:50:49.279 --> 00:50:54.464]  We talked to a 43-year-old Hispanic man who was questioned by police about the Cheryl Green murder.
[00:50:54.464 --> 00:51:00.250]  We can't show his face, but listen to some of the things he says about African Americans in his neighborhood.
[00:51:00.350 --> 00:51:05.074]  I just wish they would just leave and go wherever they gotta go and just leave us the way we were and everything would be cool.
[00:51:05.074 --> 00:51:08.517]  We had a nice little, nice little community here and it's not nice anymore.
[00:51:08.517 --> 00:51:09.618]  Because of him.
[00:51:09.618 --> 00:51:10.799]  What does it bring?
[00:51:10.799 --> 00:51:12.640]  Jedoism?
[00:51:12.640 --> 00:51:16.023]  It brought lowlife just... Dirty, man.
[00:51:16.023 --> 00:51:16.944]  Am I dirty?
[00:51:16.944 --> 00:51:18.325]  You guys know, man.
[00:51:18.325 --> 00:51:21.768]  Black-brown tension isn't confined to gangs or this neighborhood.
[00:51:21.768 --> 00:51:28.354]  It's a problem in many cities, prisons, and even some schools where fights like this one last year in Southern California
[00:51:29.622 --> 00:51:32.823]  After this break, we'll arrest the clip and I'll analyze it.
[00:51:32.823 --> 00:51:33.403]  Stay with us.
[00:51:33.403 --> 00:51:38.885]  PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:51:38.885 --> 00:51:39.545]  It's here.
[00:51:39.545 --> 00:51:44.707]  After a year in production and traveling to distant lands, my new film Terror Storm is complete.
[00:51:44.707 --> 00:51:52.309]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[00:51:53.024 --> 00:52:00.487]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[00:52:00.487 --> 00:52:12.212]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, the White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[00:52:12.212 --> 00:52:16.194]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[00:52:16.194 --> 00:52:18.435]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[00:52:18.435 --> 00:52:22.217]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[00:53:07.919 --> 00:53:11.659]  It even reduces radon-222, lead, and other heavy metals.

[00:54:58.603 --> 00:55:00.084]  Welcome back.
[00:55:00.084 --> 00:55:06.708]  Let me make some points about the first part of that CNN piece you just heard.
[00:55:28.661 --> 00:55:30.643]  They are calling murder hate crimes.
[00:55:30.643 --> 00:55:34.707]  You know, it's kind of like those white guys that drug that black guy to death in Jasper.
[00:55:34.707 --> 00:55:38.951]  They all got the death penalty, but then the media kept going, they haven't been punished.
[00:55:38.951 --> 00:55:42.334]  They wouldn't even give them a hate crime law.
[00:55:42.334 --> 00:55:44.497]  And they want to use that for your speech, folks.
[00:55:44.497 --> 00:55:46.599]  They want to use it on everybody's speech.
[00:55:46.599 --> 00:55:48.841]  So there's no need for these so-called hate laws.
[00:55:49.835 --> 00:55:55.296]  And they also called them two Latinos of the suspects that are killing the 14-year-old black girl.
[00:55:55.296 --> 00:55:56.176]  And I went and looked it up.
[00:55:56.176 --> 00:55:57.296]  They're illegal aliens.
[00:55:57.296 --> 00:55:59.897]  But see, they don't want to say that.
[00:55:59.897 --> 00:56:02.657]  And in a way, that ends up blaming American Hispanics, U.S.
[00:56:02.657 --> 00:56:03.998]  Hispanics.
[00:56:03.998 --> 00:56:07.959]  No, the majority of the crime is being committed by these illegal aliens.
[00:56:07.959 --> 00:56:10.279]  That is the majority of Hispanic crime.
[00:56:10.279 --> 00:56:14.580]  Those are the crime statistics out of Houston and L.A.
[00:56:14.580 --> 00:56:15.440]  Those are just the numbers.
[00:56:16.791 --> 00:56:18.913]  Also, let's get something clear here.
[00:56:18.913 --> 00:56:25.177]  Blacks and whites have gone through political correctness conditioning.
[00:56:25.177 --> 00:56:25.658]  Okay?
[00:56:25.658 --> 00:56:27.899]  Whites more than anyone else.
[00:56:27.899 --> 00:56:30.822]  But Hispanics, especially from Mexico, it's still old world.
[00:56:30.822 --> 00:56:34.064]  There's still massive racism down there.
[00:56:34.064 --> 00:56:38.367]  And you're higher up in the social strata, the whiter you are.
[00:56:38.367 --> 00:56:39.608]  And that's the weird thing.
[00:56:39.608 --> 00:56:40.869]  And see, people in the U.S.
[00:56:40.869 --> 00:56:41.870]  don't understand this.
[00:56:43.304 --> 00:56:47.865]  They don't understand that Nazism is extremely popular in Latin America.
[00:56:47.865 --> 00:56:49.425]  So it's a weird amalgamation.
[00:56:49.425 --> 00:56:50.965]  It's really bizarre.
[00:56:50.965 --> 00:56:56.046]  And our government is doing everything they can to suppress this, cover this up, whitewash this.
[00:56:56.046 --> 00:56:57.507]  The CNN piece is a whitewash.
[00:56:57.507 --> 00:57:00.007]  They talk about, there was a fight between blacks and Hispanics.
[00:57:00.007 --> 00:57:02.127]  It was all caught on school surveillance cameras.
[00:57:02.127 --> 00:57:07.108]  It was in the news locally, but nationally they just called it a race riot.
[00:57:07.108 --> 00:57:10.289]  No, Hispanics attacked the minority group of blacks.
[00:57:11.323 --> 00:57:15.185]  Who are now a minority at those schools, and it's happening all over the country.
[00:57:15.185 --> 00:57:17.907]  They're taking down the American flags, running up Mexican flags.
[00:57:17.907 --> 00:57:19.267]  It's been all over the news.
[00:57:19.267 --> 00:57:25.331]  The police come and arrest white and black students that hoist back up the American flag, saying it was provocative.
[00:57:25.331 --> 00:57:25.751]  You see?
[00:57:25.751 --> 00:57:31.014]  And again, most Hispanics are wonderful, patriotic Americans.
[00:57:31.014 --> 00:57:35.456]  67% in major Gallup polls want the illegals deported.
[00:57:35.456 --> 00:57:38.338]  It's over 90% now, if you average in all the race groups.
[00:57:39.270 --> 00:57:44.754]  So, it's important we all come together and realize these illegal aliens are being used to balkanize and break down the country.
[00:57:44.754 --> 00:57:46.635]  Look, George Bush is for an open border.
[00:57:46.635 --> 00:57:47.736]  He's for amnesty.
[00:57:47.736 --> 00:57:49.977]  Isn't George Bush wrong on every other issue?
[00:57:49.977 --> 00:58:02.505]  So liberals need to understand this, and I guess most of them do now, that this is a strategic plan to get us all fighting with each other and to bring in so many newcomers that they can't assimilate in a melting pot.
[00:58:04.494 --> 00:58:06.195]  That's the bottom line of what's happening here.
[00:58:06.195 --> 00:58:08.857]  We'll have to play more of the scene in clip later if we have time.
[00:58:08.857 --> 00:58:09.878]  This Hutton Gibson is coming up.
[00:58:09.878 --> 00:58:11.999]  I want to get him on right at the start of the hour, John.
[00:58:11.999 --> 00:58:13.940]  So go ahead and dial him.

[00:59:26.894 --> 00:59:27.974]  Can we stop?
[00:59:27.974 --> 00:59:29.935]  We need to go to the bathroom.
[00:59:29.935 --> 00:59:30.535]  What?
[00:59:30.535 --> 00:59:31.315]  Again?
[00:59:31.315 --> 00:59:33.015]  We just stopped two hours ago.
[00:59:33.015 --> 00:59:34.296]  Honey, let's stop.
[00:59:34.296 --> 00:59:37.656]  Because I gave the kids their Spark Berkey water bottles.
[00:59:37.656 --> 00:59:39.157]  Why did you do that?
[00:59:39.157 --> 00:59:41.577]  Because they can't drink and talk at the same time.
[00:59:41.577 --> 00:59:45.238]  And that way we don't have to listen to them singing, Are we there yet?
[00:59:45.238 --> 00:59:46.378]  Are we there yet?
[00:59:46.378 --> 00:59:47.718]  For the entire trip.
[00:59:47.718 --> 00:59:48.639]  Hmm.
[00:59:48.639 --> 00:59:49.859]  I didn't think about that.
[00:59:50.379 --> 00:59:51.682]  Great idea!
[00:59:51.682 --> 00:59:52.284]  Yeah!
[00:59:52.284 --> 00:59:54.629]  And it's cheap entertainment for the kids!
[00:59:54.629 --> 00:59:56.473]  Bottled water costs around 75 cents.
[00:59:56.473 --> 00:59:59.260]  Costs us less than a half cents per refill.
[00:59:59.260 --> 00:59:59.600]  Honey!
[01:00:00.379 --> 01:00:02.021]  You're terrific!
[01:00:02.021 --> 01:00:03.642]  Oh honey, so are you!
[01:00:03.642 --> 01:00:07.326]  You're the one that bought the family our Sport Berkey Water Bottles!
[01:00:07.326 --> 01:00:08.607]  Now can we stop?
[01:00:08.607 --> 01:00:09.648]  I need to go too.
[01:00:09.648 --> 01:00:14.153]  Get your Berkey Sport Purification Bottle for only $39 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.

[01:00:25.450 --> 01:00:27.854]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:00:27.854 --> 01:00:30.639]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:37.370 --> 01:00:38.670]  Big Brother.
[01:00:38.670 --> 01:00:40.431]  Mainstream media.
[01:00:40.431 --> 01:00:42.191]  Government cover-ups.
[01:00:42.191 --> 01:00:43.771]  You want answers?
[01:00:43.771 --> 01:00:44.692]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:44.692 --> 01:00:49.513]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:49.513 --> 01:00:57.034]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:57.034 --> 01:01:06.436]  We're now into the second hour, blasting out on the AM and FM dials, simulcasting globally on shortwave and the web at InfoWars.com, JonesReport.com, and PrisonPlanet.com.
[01:01:08.385 --> 01:01:11.547]  He has written multiple scholarly volumes.
[01:01:11.547 --> 01:01:14.268]  I've read two of his books.
[01:01:14.268 --> 01:01:19.972]  He has made a documentary presentation about corruption and decline on the Catholic Church.
[01:01:19.972 --> 01:01:22.873]  He, of course, is a World War II veteran.
[01:01:22.873 --> 01:01:28.757]  He is a national champion back in the 60s of the TV game show Jeopardy!
[01:01:28.757 --> 01:01:31.178]  Pretty darn smart.
[01:01:31.178 --> 01:01:34.200]  And he's even corrected me on air a few times with my history.
[01:01:34.887 --> 01:01:35.868]  Yes, we are.
[01:01:48.749 --> 01:01:49.589]  Oh, it's a pleasure.
[01:02:17.404 --> 01:02:20.447]  I tell you, so much has happened since we last talked on air.
[01:02:20.447 --> 01:02:22.849]  How many, was that like two and a half years ago?
[01:02:22.849 --> 01:02:25.832]  It must be at least, yes.
[01:02:25.832 --> 01:02:30.457]  Well, I tell you, you really got misrepresented and attacked in the press, but it wasn't successful.
[01:02:30.457 --> 01:02:31.458]  It seemed to backfire.
[01:02:32.473 --> 01:02:35.175]  But we're not going to be getting into those issues today.
[01:02:35.175 --> 01:02:43.161]  We're going to be talking about something you're really an expert on and recognized by many traditional Catholics as one of the most informed people.
[01:02:43.161 --> 01:02:44.322]  And what would you call it?
[01:02:44.322 --> 01:02:49.646]  Just the takeover of the Catholic Church or the decline or the Masonicization?
[01:02:49.646 --> 01:02:51.747]  What would you call it?
[01:02:51.747 --> 01:02:53.429]  The replacement, I would say.
[01:02:53.429 --> 01:02:57.732]  What we have there now is nothing like the Catholic Church I grew up in.
[01:02:59.585 --> 01:03:01.446]  We've only got a few minutes before we break.
[01:03:01.446 --> 01:03:05.508]  Give us a little bit of an overview of some of the issues you want to discuss today.
[01:03:05.508 --> 01:03:13.553]  Well, for instance, the church has turned into a discussion society.
[01:03:13.553 --> 01:03:17.515]  It's meant to be a missionary society.
[01:03:17.515 --> 01:03:19.196]  The church has four marks.
[01:03:19.196 --> 01:03:24.159]  It is one, holy, catholic, apostolic.
[01:03:24.159 --> 01:03:26.580]  And all those marks are gone in this new church.
[01:03:28.115 --> 01:03:31.957]  Especially the Apostolic, because that means you go and preach the Word.
[01:03:31.957 --> 01:03:35.059]  That's what Christ said to do.
[01:03:35.059 --> 01:03:37.860]  And He would be with us all days.
[01:03:37.860 --> 01:03:40.742]  To preach His Gospel.
[01:03:40.742 --> 01:03:45.845]  When you stop preaching it, you can't expect Him to be with you.
[01:03:45.845 --> 01:03:54.830]  They decided that salvation is available everywhere, so why would anyone bother to come to the Church?
[01:03:54.830 --> 01:03:56.831]  Which used to be the most difficult road.
[01:03:59.482 --> 01:04:24.208]  Well, anyway... We'll also get into, you've got a little list of things here that we've talked about privately, Ratzinger, what he's really doing, how he was praying to Mecca, also how he's been calling now three times since he got in there, into the papal seat calling for a new world order, and also you've discovered that a new cathedral they built is really a Masonic temple.
[01:04:24.208 --> 01:04:27.189]  Yes, that's, when they put up this building
[01:04:29.099 --> 01:04:32.100]  As a shrine to Padre Pio.
[01:04:32.100 --> 01:04:37.383]  And when you look at it, you see Masonic design everywhere.
[01:04:37.383 --> 01:04:38.344]  And I mean everywhere.
[01:04:38.344 --> 01:04:43.847]  It's too blatant to be accidental.
[01:04:43.847 --> 01:04:46.228]  Like all this stuff in the church entirely.
[01:04:46.228 --> 01:04:50.990]  It's all too obvious to be accidental.
[01:04:50.990 --> 01:04:54.052]  It cannot have happened by accident according to our theology.
[01:04:55.675 --> 01:04:57.476]  That building is a demonstration of it.
[01:04:57.476 --> 01:05:04.360]  They've done pretty much the same down in Mexico at the shrine of Our Lady of Guadalupe.
[01:05:04.360 --> 01:05:09.062]  And then over in Portugal at Our Lady of Fatima.
[01:05:09.062 --> 01:05:10.863]  Hutton Gibson, we're going to break.
[01:05:10.863 --> 01:05:11.643]  We're going to come back.
[01:05:11.643 --> 01:05:12.263]  Long segment.
[01:05:12.263 --> 01:05:13.524]  Plenty of time to break this down.
[01:05:13.524 --> 01:05:15.105]  Let's get into Ratzinger.
[01:05:15.105 --> 01:05:16.185]  What his agenda is.
[01:05:16.185 --> 01:05:19.026]  Get into the new cathedrals.
[01:05:19.026 --> 01:05:20.607]  Masonic temples.
[01:05:20.607 --> 01:05:24.029]  And talk about the demonization by
[01:05:24.853 --> 01:05:28.894]  Different organizations of traditional Catholics, which you are one.
[01:05:28.894 --> 01:05:30.195]  We'll be right back.
[01:05:30.195 --> 01:05:36.137]  Stay with us.
[01:05:36.137 --> 01:05:39.678]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands.
[01:05:39.678 --> 01:05:41.979]  My new film Terror Storm is complete.
[01:05:41.979 --> 01:05:49.621]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[01:05:50.310 --> 01:05:57.752]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[01:05:57.752 --> 01:06:09.495]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, the White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[01:06:09.495 --> 01:06:13.456]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.

[01:07:38.198 --> 01:07:43.681]  Since its creation in 1913, the Federal Reserve has not been held responsible for its own debt.
[01:07:43.681 --> 01:07:47.143]  So why should you, the hard-working American, be harassed for yours?
[01:07:47.143 --> 01:07:54.248]  There's a double standard when it comes to being responsible for debt, and unlike the Federal Reserve, the people of this country can't print more money when needed.
[01:07:54.608 --> 01:08:02.237]  Day of Jubilee has created a successful program designed for people that want to stop harassing calls and threatening letters from bill collectors.

[01:08:28.819 --> 01:08:33.722]  Don't wait any longer to get your life back in order.
[01:08:33.722 --> 01:08:39.425]  He's the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones, on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:08:39.425 --> 01:08:44.348]  Alright, for stations that just joined us, recapping,
[01:08:45.100 --> 01:08:56.203]  Hutton Gibson, World War II vet, author, researcher, traditional Catholic leader, father of Mel Gibson, joins us.
[01:08:56.203 --> 01:09:14.649]  He's been misrepresented and misquoted and twisted by the press, and I consider him to be a very nice, very informed, good person who's done a lot of good works, and I wanted you to have a chance to hear what Hutton Gibson really has to say from him, not from the New York Times or 20-20 or something else,
[01:09:15.981 --> 01:09:21.983]  And I'm honored that he hasn't been on the air in about two and a half years since the whole Passion of the Christ controversy.
[01:09:21.983 --> 01:09:28.245]  He is now with his maiden voyage here back on Talk Radio joining us.
[01:09:28.245 --> 01:09:43.110]  Hutton, I think the best place to start is how you got disillusioned with the modern Catholic Church, how it changed, and then a few years ago I was reading your book, The Enemy is Still Here, pointing there at Rome.
[01:09:44.375 --> 01:09:46.539]  And large sections are about Ratzinger.
[01:09:46.539 --> 01:09:51.866]  You were fingering him then as one of the prime controllers of the Illuminati.
[01:09:53.155 --> 01:09:58.037]  Infiltration and control of the Catholic Church, the whole Masonic influence.
[01:09:58.037 --> 01:10:10.040]  So if you can, break down kind of how you woke up, and then who Ratzinger is, and then I'd like to talk about some of the things he's been doing, calling for a one-world government, a one-world religion, saying all religions are the same.
[01:10:10.040 --> 01:10:19.143]  I'd like to go through that with you, and I think once you've illustrated that, how could anybody be one of these mainline so-called Catholics, because they're not really Catholics?
[01:10:19.143 --> 01:10:21.404]  So please enlighten us on that.
[01:10:23.089 --> 01:10:24.950]  Well, I got into the deal.
[01:10:24.950 --> 01:10:39.898]  See, when I was in this country, I was too far from the Catholic schools and my children were not being subjected to this gradual subversion coming into the schools about 1960 and 61.
[01:10:39.898 --> 01:10:43.620]  When I moved to Australia, I thought it would be a great idea to send them to Catholic school.
[01:10:43.620 --> 01:10:46.281]  By gosh, I can do this again.
[01:10:46.281 --> 01:10:48.722]  And so I did.
[01:10:48.722 --> 01:10:51.524]  And about a year later, they came around and showed me what they were
[01:10:52.711 --> 01:10:56.152]  Using for texts in religion class.
[01:10:56.152 --> 01:10:58.172]  It wasn't the catechism.
[01:10:58.172 --> 01:11:03.093]  It was no, uh, nothing that had anything to do with the Catholic Church.
[01:11:03.093 --> 01:11:06.654]  It was a publication put out every month.
[01:11:06.654 --> 01:11:10.755]  And, uh, the boys at the school, which was St.
[01:11:10.755 --> 01:11:19.897]  Leo's in Maroonga, Sydney, Australia, would take this paper out to the cricket ground and burn it ceremonially.
[01:11:21.674 --> 01:11:24.376]  So they didn't believe it either.
[01:11:24.376 --> 01:11:25.776]  So they knew what was going on?
[01:11:25.776 --> 01:11:26.197]  Yes.
[01:11:26.197 --> 01:11:30.639]  Well, I took a look at this stuff and I got into it with the Cardinal.
[01:11:30.639 --> 01:11:33.661]  We'd just been made a Cardinal then, Freeman.
[01:11:33.661 --> 01:11:38.103]  And he referred me here and referred me there because he couldn't do anything about it.
[01:11:38.103 --> 01:11:41.705]  He wasn't very bright.
[01:11:41.705 --> 01:11:46.268]  And I sent him along.
[01:11:46.268 --> 01:11:48.229]  Australian pages are a bit longer than the 11.
[01:11:49.486 --> 01:11:53.909]  It's about eight and a quarter by fourteen instead.
[01:11:53.909 --> 01:12:07.416]  And I filled up eight pages of that with heresies I culled out of this publication, this periodical that came out ten times or eleven times a year.
[01:12:07.416 --> 01:12:12.800]  They broke for Christmas.
[01:12:12.800 --> 01:12:16.162]  And he didn't answer me.
[01:12:16.162 --> 01:12:16.882]  One way he said,
[01:12:17.492 --> 01:12:20.813]  We're not here to jam religion down these boys' throats.
[01:12:20.813 --> 01:12:23.554]  And I thought to myself, huh?
[01:12:23.554 --> 01:12:25.695]  What are you there for?
[01:12:25.695 --> 01:12:28.036]  This is why they go to Catholic school.
[01:12:28.036 --> 01:12:30.017]  To get their religion.
[01:12:30.017 --> 01:12:34.799]  Whether it's jammed down their throats or what, they gotta get it.
[01:12:34.799 --> 01:12:36.400]  And they were not getting it.
[01:12:36.400 --> 01:12:42.882]  So I got into the battle with him, and the next thing you know, I found out that there was a real mass around somewhere.
[01:12:42.882 --> 01:12:44.403]  I hadn't noticed so much.
[01:12:44.403 --> 01:12:45.363]  I've been traveling.
[01:12:45.363 --> 01:12:47.104]  I hadn't noticed the changes so much.
[01:12:48.934 --> 01:12:55.178]  I used to wonder, for instance, why did the Irish take this lying down?
[01:12:55.178 --> 01:13:03.202]  And what it comes down to is that they were given the old patriotic approach.
[01:13:03.202 --> 01:13:06.164]  And their vernacular was not English, it was Gaelic.
[01:13:06.164 --> 01:13:12.068]  And most of them don't speak it or understand it too well.
[01:13:12.068 --> 01:13:14.549]  So, anyway, that's all by the way.
[01:13:14.549 --> 01:13:17.591]  But in Australia, they were the first to go vernacular.
[01:13:18.929 --> 01:13:23.452]  And, uh, the translations, of course, are wretched.
[01:13:23.452 --> 01:13:31.138]  And then I found the Latin Mass Society, and joined it, and found out things are much worse than I had thought.
[01:13:31.138 --> 01:13:44.287]  So then I got into it for... for fair, uh, objecting to that, uh, what they call the Novus Ordo Missae, the New Order of Mass, which came in in 1969.
[01:13:46.696 --> 01:13:50.799]  And replaced all these translations that were going here and there and everywhere.
[01:13:50.799 --> 01:13:51.480]  Yeah, that's the key.
[01:13:51.480 --> 01:13:53.842]  They didn't just take out a Latin into English or Spanish.
[01:13:53.842 --> 01:13:55.443]  They then changed it.
[01:13:55.443 --> 01:14:07.773]  And then from that change, we move forward 30 years and Popes are calling, Pope John Paul II, Ratzinger, the new guy, they're calling for a new world order.
[01:14:07.773 --> 01:14:11.096]  They're calling hundreds of religions to
[01:14:12.652 --> 01:14:41.705]  uh... the vatican and saying they're all the same i mean this is a hundred eighty degrees from what's in the bible how did this happen in such a short short uh... space and time historically well mostly uh... it was the communist tactic we educate the young or miseducate the young or fail to educate the young so that we have two or three generations now which have never seen the catholic church in action uh...
[01:14:42.902 --> 01:14:52.145]  When Pius XII left us in 1958, I was 40 years old.
[01:14:52.145 --> 01:14:52.965]  I knew my church.
[01:14:52.965 --> 01:14:54.206]  I'd been raised Catholic.
[01:14:54.206 --> 01:14:58.967]  All my instruction and all my formal schooling was Catholic.
[01:14:58.967 --> 01:15:01.648]  And I got in the army, and I was the target for everybody.
[01:15:01.648 --> 01:15:03.549]  You want to argue religion?
[01:15:03.549 --> 01:15:05.349]  Go see Gibson.
[01:15:05.349 --> 01:15:11.191]  And I will have to say, with a great deal of pride, that I never lost an argument.
[01:15:12.079 --> 01:15:18.204]  But they all wound up saying to me, all you Catholics are all alike, you're a bunch of sheep, you just do what you're told.
[01:15:18.204 --> 01:15:22.688]  And I always said, nonsense, I know exactly what I believe and why.
[01:15:22.688 --> 01:15:28.993]  But I've figured out now that most people did not have my education.
[01:15:28.993 --> 01:15:30.655]  In spite of going through the Catholic schools.
[01:15:30.655 --> 01:15:37.460]  Of course, when I got out, having argued with all these people, I realized I hadn't picked up enough.
[01:15:37.460 --> 01:15:39.442]  So I went into it in earnest and
[01:15:40.089 --> 01:15:48.157]  I have quite a library of Catholic books and encyclopedias and dictionaries and various types of Bibles.
[01:15:48.157 --> 01:15:52.781]  I've got everything you could imagine here that fills a double garage.
[01:15:52.781 --> 01:15:54.703]  It used to be.
[01:15:54.703 --> 01:16:03.972]  Well there's no debating, I mean you can debate in the past all day long, but there's no debating now that the Catholic Church is a pure instrument, and I know you would say it isn't really the Catholic Church,
[01:16:05.106 --> 01:16:06.527]  of world government.
[01:16:06.527 --> 01:16:08.249]  Move us forward to Ratzinger.
[01:16:08.249 --> 01:16:10.871]  You start writing books, you start speaking out.
[01:16:10.871 --> 01:16:16.876]  You fingered Ratzinger a long time ago as a prime mover.
[01:16:16.876 --> 01:16:21.879]  He was one of these, what they call periti, the Vatican II.
[01:16:21.879 --> 01:16:22.820]  Experienced man.
[01:16:22.820 --> 01:16:23.941]  It's the same word.
[01:16:23.941 --> 01:16:26.883]  Experio.
[01:16:26.883 --> 01:16:32.428]  So he was there advising all these bishops that had been called together.
[01:16:33.816 --> 01:16:46.041]  Most of whom seem to have left their brains outside the door and gone in and taken all this... There's one thing that you can say about Vatican II.
[01:16:46.041 --> 01:17:00.986]  In contrast to all ages of the Catholic Church and its councils and its doctrines and its accurate and explicit phraseology, you find Vatican II, which put out more
[01:17:02.128 --> 01:17:12.993]  And the largest council we had before, which put out more than all the councils together before that, this is a great bank of fog.
[01:17:12.993 --> 01:17:15.875]  Nobody can figure out what it means.
[01:17:15.875 --> 01:17:24.079]  It contradicts itself internally, it promotes heresies which have been condemned by the church, and
[01:17:25.908 --> 01:17:27.189]  Well, Ratzinger was there.
[01:17:27.189 --> 01:17:28.669]  He was right there in the beginning.
[01:17:28.669 --> 01:17:35.132]  He was helping out to put it over on these bishops.
[01:17:35.132 --> 01:17:53.060]  Then he advanced through the church and he wound up as a so-called cardinal and a so-called bishop and put in charge of the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith, which is a change in name, of course,
[01:17:55.379 --> 01:18:00.683]  The congregation of the Holy Office.
[01:18:00.683 --> 01:18:04.585]  And so he got in a key position over the canons in the doctrine.
[01:18:04.585 --> 01:18:05.706]  Yes, that's correct.
[01:18:05.706 --> 01:18:07.747]  He was there in charge.
[01:18:07.747 --> 01:18:20.736]  And while there in charge, he promoted a book and wrote the preface for it called, what is it?
[01:18:20.736 --> 01:18:21.657]  It was put out by the
[01:18:22.819 --> 01:18:33.125]  The Pontifical Biblical Commission, and the title of the book is The Hebrew People and Their Holy Scriptures in the Christian Bible.
[01:18:33.125 --> 01:18:43.511]  And then he proceeded to deduce that we should listen to this, we should accept them because they may be right.
[01:18:43.511 --> 01:18:45.912]  Now, if they are right, then we are wrong.
[01:18:47.404 --> 01:18:49.606]  Basically, it's what the Pharisees were saying to Christ.
[01:18:49.606 --> 01:18:52.828]  He's saying the Pharisees might be the good guys.
[01:18:52.828 --> 01:18:54.669]  Yes, that's it.
[01:18:54.669 --> 01:18:56.170]  They could be right.
[01:18:56.170 --> 01:19:08.598]  These Masoretic Scriptures, which, of course, they had in their hands and eliminated anything they found distasteful to them over, well, almost two millennia now.
[01:19:12.381 --> 01:19:19.663]  We are supposed to take their slant on it because, I guess, because they understand Hebrew.
[01:19:19.663 --> 01:19:23.745]  But it comes right down to it.
[01:19:23.745 --> 01:19:24.005]  St.
[01:19:24.005 --> 01:19:27.266]  Paul says, if Christ be not risen, then is our faith vain.
[01:19:28.126 --> 01:19:32.528]  Well, we may disagree on the central fact of history.
[01:19:32.528 --> 01:19:37.451]  Well, we know Hutton Gibson, where they're going with this, because now there's no pretense.
[01:19:37.451 --> 01:19:42.033]  I mean, the Rat Singers openly saying, New World Order, One World Religion.
[01:19:42.033 --> 01:19:44.375]  I mean, this guy's talking like the Antichrist now.
[01:19:44.375 --> 01:19:47.676]  He certainly is.
[01:19:47.676 --> 01:19:49.417]  He gets crazier by the day.
[01:19:49.417 --> 01:19:55.941]  He goes to Istanbul, and while he's there on another tack,
[01:19:56.710 --> 01:20:00.312]  He receives these mazlums, and of course it was staged.
[01:20:00.312 --> 01:20:03.153]  Nothing is done by accident there.
[01:20:03.153 --> 01:20:09.336]  He goes to their mosque, and he's there, I guess with his shoes off, during their prayer time.
[01:20:09.336 --> 01:20:12.777]  So it was no shock to him that they were going to pray five times a day.
[01:20:12.777 --> 01:20:17.200]  They do this, and he joins in.
[01:20:17.200 --> 01:20:18.060]  Hutton, stay there.
[01:20:18.060 --> 01:20:18.760]  We've got a break.
[01:20:18.760 --> 01:20:20.241]  I want to come back and talk about
[01:20:21.318 --> 01:20:31.046]  When you believe the Masonic Order was able to fully take over the Catholic Church, and what Ratsinger's doing, where the Catholic Church, or what they call the Catholic Church, where it's going.
[01:20:31.046 --> 01:20:33.147]  We'll be right back after this quick break.
[01:20:33.147 --> 01:20:41.234]  Terrorism, terrorism, chemical attacks, dirty bombs, fallout, biological attack, anthrax, and to top it all off, duct tape and plastic.
[01:20:41.234 --> 01:20:43.075]  Alarming words for our time.
[01:20:43.075 --> 01:20:45.517]  But how do you protect your family during such a crisis?
[01:20:45.937 --> 01:21:00.527]  The video, Sheltering in Place, Surviving Acts of Terrorism from Biological, Chemical, and Radioactive Fallout, was developed by Wayne LeBaron, a health physicist who has served as a specialist in environmental health, communicable diseases, and has worked as a nuclear specialist for the U.S.
[01:21:00.527 --> 01:21:01.027]  government.

[01:21:35.924 --> 01:21:42.111]  Did you know that Communism has stated that America would not jump from Capitalism to Communism?
[01:21:42.111 --> 01:21:50.060]  That our elected leaders would pass laws to socialize America and one day we would wake up and have Socialism-Communism and not even know how it happened?
[01:21:50.860 --> 01:21:56.305]  Have we seen this very type of socialization of America over the last 60 years?
[01:21:56.305 --> 01:22:01.510]  We've been pushed far down the slippery slope of socialism-communism and don't even know it.
[01:22:01.510 --> 01:22:03.933]  Just as Nikita Khrushchev said.
[01:22:03.933 --> 01:22:11.640]  We'd like to help you understand how these things are coming to pass by offering you an absolutely free one-year subscription to Newswatch Magazine.

[01:22:18.274 --> 01:22:20.055]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson, here for the 2007 Red Book.
[01:22:39.088 --> 01:22:44.112]  The commodity markets like gold, silver, copper, aluminum and oil have exploded over the last year.
[01:22:44.112 --> 01:22:46.894]  This is a glaring testimony of how quickly the U.S.
[01:22:46.894 --> 01:22:49.356]  dollar can be devalued.
[01:22:49.356 --> 01:22:54.881]  Many have turned to precious metals to provide a safe haven while increasing the potential profits.
[01:22:54.881 --> 01:23:03.147]  Though accumulating precious metals has been a proven method for the storage of wealth, it is important that you understand the market you are getting into.
[01:23:03.147 --> 01:23:06.210]  Midas Resources is offering the red book and silver dollar for only $27.95.
[01:23:08.337 --> 01:23:12.781]  The Red Book is the number one best-selling guide to gold and silver coins.
[01:23:12.781 --> 01:23:14.944]  Call for your copy today.

[01:23:17.566 --> 01:23:24.133]  If you've already accumulated or plan to get into the precious metals market, you simply must have the Red Book in your library.
[01:23:24.133 --> 01:23:24.473]  Call 800-686-2237.
[01:23:24.473 --> 01:23:24.733]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[01:23:32.017 --> 01:23:33.419]  How are you feeling today?
[01:23:33.419 --> 01:23:40.567]  I ask because if you have health challenges, then reading our free booklet about the most amazing discovery of our time is crucial.
[01:23:40.567 --> 01:23:45.332]  The booklet is about an amazing fruit from Southeast Asia they call Mangosteen.
[01:23:45.332 --> 01:23:51.419]  It's a centuries-old medicinal fruit whose time has come and it has amassed 40 years of published research.
[01:23:51.579 --> 01:23:51.879]  I think so.
[01:24:07.148 --> 01:24:07.629]  We're good to go.
[01:24:39.560 --> 01:24:45.881]  He hasn't been on the radio in over two and a half years, and joins us now, breaking a silence, Hutton Gibson.
[01:24:45.881 --> 01:24:52.983]  It's a short segment, long segment, coming up after this one.
[01:24:52.983 --> 01:25:03.946]  Hutton, we were talking during the break, there's another point you want to discuss, how the Illuminati crowd, when they fully took control, also wanted to, I guess, break the church's
[01:25:06.247 --> 01:25:06.767]  Yes, we were.
[01:25:06.767 --> 01:25:07.007]  There was a
[01:25:37.427 --> 01:25:43.289]  A bunch of people around the turn of the last century.
[01:25:43.289 --> 01:25:45.610]  Modernists.
[01:25:45.610 --> 01:25:51.591]  And they were doing their best to take over the doctrine of the Church.
[01:25:51.591 --> 01:25:54.652]  And the running of it.
[01:25:54.652 --> 01:25:58.974]  We almost had one of those fellows elected Pope.
[01:25:58.974 --> 01:26:00.954]  In 1903.
[01:26:00.954 --> 01:26:05.276]  Cardinal Mariano Rampolla del Tindaro.
[01:26:07.987 --> 01:26:17.369]  But the Emperor of Austria, acting with his hat on, Holy Roman Emperor, vetoed him.
[01:26:17.369 --> 01:26:19.449]  So, before he was elected.
[01:26:19.449 --> 01:26:27.610]  He could not have vetoed him afterwards, but he got in before when it looked like he would be elected.
[01:26:27.610 --> 01:26:35.972]  So, the trouble is that he was still there in the Church, and acted as Secretary of State,
[01:26:37.125 --> 01:26:46.928]  Some of the time to Pius X. And he contributed to a new code of canon law.
[01:26:46.928 --> 01:26:50.689]  There had been no code of canon law in all church history.
[01:26:50.689 --> 01:27:01.953]  But they had laws here and decrees there, and it was such a jumble that they put them all together, not for any great benefit, but simply to have them in one place.
[01:27:01.953 --> 01:27:04.854]  And this benefited, chiefly, the canon lawyers.
[01:27:07.173 --> 01:27:23.223]  But the people that were in charge of the code and coding this thing were Modernist and Freemason and they left out a couple of strange laws.
[01:27:23.223 --> 01:27:29.866]  They don't treat the Freemasonry as it had been treated.
[01:27:29.866 --> 01:27:32.408]  It became an irregularity instead of
[01:27:36.129 --> 01:27:40.771]  An apostasy.
[01:27:40.771 --> 01:27:53.355]  This prevented the people from, if they were caught at it, from functioning as priests, bishops, anybody.
[01:27:53.355 --> 01:28:00.017]  But it didn't take away their status immediately.
[01:28:00.017 --> 01:28:04.098]  They didn't go in and dig them out and say, this is a mason.
[01:28:04.642 --> 01:28:07.925]  They did on, the Pius X did on three occasions.
[01:28:07.925 --> 01:28:11.908]  He chucked out three bishops in France.
[01:28:11.908 --> 01:28:20.476]  And one of them became the cause in 1904 of the break between the Holy See and the French government.
[01:28:20.476 --> 01:28:25.440]  Which of course was Freemasonic.
[01:28:25.440 --> 01:28:25.701]  So uh...
[01:28:28.806 --> 01:28:35.968]  But anyway, they left out these laws against Freemasons and left a room for some of these things to come back in again.
[01:28:35.968 --> 01:28:57.013]  And among the group around Rampolla and Gaspari was the Archbishop of Milan at the time.
[01:29:00.708 --> 01:29:05.572]  De La Chiesa, who became Benedict XV.
[01:29:05.572 --> 01:29:12.798]  And it was under his regime that this canon law was installed.
[01:29:12.798 --> 01:29:18.143]  And as I say, it did not have sufficient safeguards against things.
[01:29:18.143 --> 01:29:24.988]  One of the things we've just come across lately is that the same Pope, St.
[01:29:24.988 --> 01:29:27.931]  Pius V, who objected to
[01:29:29.617 --> 01:29:39.165]  Any change in the mass, he had to do this because with the Reformation going on, he had to have a mass he could guarantee.
[01:29:39.165 --> 01:29:47.272]  So he took the oldest mass available, going way back in history, before anyone could really trace it.
[01:29:47.272 --> 01:29:49.394]  And this is what he guaranteed.
[01:29:49.394 --> 01:29:52.677]  He said there will be no heedless change to this.
[01:29:52.677 --> 01:29:56.000]  Of course, there are changes made when they institute a new feast.
[01:29:57.085 --> 01:29:59.306]  You got a new saint you want to honor?
[01:29:59.306 --> 01:30:11.352]  Well, specifically, we were talking in the break, though, you were talking about a law that you guys found that was talking about not having the pedophiles in there and how it would bring down the church and let the other governments take over.
[01:30:11.352 --> 01:30:12.833]  So, let's talk about that.
[01:30:12.833 --> 01:30:23.197]  Let's talk about Ratzinger and how he's calling for a new world order, what that means, and then that new cathedral that's a Masonic temple, and a lot more with Hutton Gibson.
[01:30:23.197 --> 01:30:24.138]  We're on the march.
[01:30:24.138 --> 01:30:26.119]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:30:27.083 --> 01:30:34.406]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:30:34.406 --> 01:30:37.147]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here with an important question.
[01:30:37.147 --> 01:30:39.568]  When was the last time you used pure soap?
[01:30:39.568 --> 01:30:49.972]  I mean the hard to find kind that's all natural and not full of corrosive toxins and chemicals and detergents that just dry out your skin and have been connected to very serious health problems.
[01:30:49.972 --> 01:30:52.493]  Let me tell you something about the Cal Bend Pure Soap Company.

[01:31:33.115 --> 01:31:38.099]  We at The Bible Says want to alert the world to the topic of the Mark of the Beast.
[01:31:38.099 --> 01:31:41.342]  Soon it will be upon us as an overwhelming surprise.
[01:31:41.342 --> 01:31:44.265]  The world is pressing toward a forced one-world religion.
[01:31:44.265 --> 01:31:49.469]  The real issue behind this is the union of church and state nullifying our First Amendment.
[01:31:49.469 --> 01:31:55.154]  Americans will have to give up their peculiar beliefs and accept what the new world religious leaders prescribe.
[01:31:55.154 --> 01:31:58.117]  In 2005, President Bush signed the REAL ID Act.
[01:31:58.297 --> 01:32:00.940]  Which goes into effect May 11, 2008.
[01:32:00.940 --> 01:32:05.865]  Many people believe that this will be the mark of the beast because of the restrictive measures included.
[01:32:05.865 --> 01:32:10.309]  Which seems to parallel the no buying and selling of Revelations 13-17.
[01:32:10.309 --> 01:32:16.936]  In Revelations 14-9, speaking of the mark of the beast, it says, If any man worship the beast, take notice.
[01:32:16.936 --> 01:32:18.838]  It says, worship the beast.
[01:32:18.838 --> 01:32:21.441]  This issue is about worship, not economics.
[01:32:21.701 --> 01:32:27.046]  For a better understanding of this very important topic and to receive your three free books and a free DVD, call 1-888-211-1715.
[01:32:27.046 --> 01:32:27.246]  That's 1-888-211-1715.

[01:33:01.450 --> 01:33:05.194]  1998 gold jumps two-thirds over the Russian ruble.
[01:33:05.194 --> 01:33:08.196]  2002, the Argentine peso loses a fifth of its value to gold.
[01:33:08.196 --> 01:33:13.562]  2006, the last superpower of the USA's mighty dollar loses over half to gold and other raw goods.
[01:33:13.562 --> 01:33:15.003]  Could government let this happen?
[01:33:15.003 --> 01:33:16.965]  Without immediate backing, how much will it lose?
[01:33:17.245 --> 01:33:24.391]  Midas has Nick Bereshev's report covering the loss of purchasing power, fat tail events, bull market economic vulnerabilities, and gold-oil relationship.
[01:33:24.391 --> 01:33:26.192]  You've lost half of your purchasing power.
[01:33:26.192 --> 01:33:27.693]  Call 800-686-2237 before the rest disappears.
[01:33:27.693 --> 01:33:28.073]  That's 800-686-2237.
[01:33:45.038 --> 01:33:47.498]  World War II veteran, National Jeopardy!
[01:33:47.498 --> 01:34:11.643]  champion back in the 60s, and of course, author, father of Mel Gibson and ten other children, Hutton Gibson is our guest, for those who just joined us, and I mean, every few months, some Catholic Cardinal calls for a One World Government, a New World Order, Ratzinger has done it three times, that's the current so-called Pope,
[01:34:12.626 --> 01:34:17.288]  And so people could debate all day, you know, was the Catholic Church evil 100 years ago?
[01:34:17.288 --> 01:34:18.609]  Was it evil 50 years ago?
[01:34:18.609 --> 01:34:22.831]  There is no debating.
[01:34:22.831 --> 01:34:36.737]  There's no debating that this is not the Catholic Church it was, and there's no debating the fact that it is a total tool of one world government, and the symbolism and the buildings they're building and everything they're doing is pushing for a one world religion.
[01:34:38.610 --> 01:34:43.653]  Break down for us, Hutton, what Ratzinger means from your studying of him.
[01:34:43.653 --> 01:34:55.301]  You've written a book, a lot of it is about him, about what he means when he says a new world order and why he's going to mosque and praying to Mecca.
[01:34:55.301 --> 01:34:57.443]  Why is he calling for a one world religion?
[01:34:57.443 --> 01:34:59.164]  I mean this stuff is right out of Revelations.
[01:35:04.528 --> 01:35:14.010]  It's almost an axiom that if you're going to have a one world government, you pretty well gotta have a one world religion.
[01:35:14.010 --> 01:35:19.091]  People will have religion to fight over, they'll fight over it.
[01:35:19.091 --> 01:35:24.652]  So if they're all in one crew that way, that's one big thing eliminated.
[01:35:24.652 --> 01:35:32.034]  It also tones the church down to where it will never argue with the government.
[01:35:32.034 --> 01:35:34.234]  Which it should be doing in any number of cases.
[01:35:36.062 --> 01:35:40.003]  Uh, for instance, abortion.
[01:35:40.003 --> 01:35:45.844]  Uh, and he has his own crew in there.
[01:35:45.844 --> 01:35:56.466]  Now they've been at this for well over a hundred years, getting their people in, into the government of the church itself.
[01:35:56.466 --> 01:36:02.067]  And the people, I don't say all necessarily Freemasons,
[01:36:03.376 --> 01:36:13.439]  But most of them are vulnerable, as were the high muckety mucks at Vatican II, to blackmail.
[01:36:13.439 --> 01:36:29.945]  And the blackmail was not necessarily that they belonged to the Free Nations, though in a number of cases it was so, but in almost all cases they had their hands in the till, or they had girlfriends,
[01:36:31.591 --> 01:36:36.135]  Or, they had boyfriends.
[01:36:36.135 --> 01:36:41.340]  Even a couple of our so-called popes have had boyfriends.
[01:36:41.340 --> 01:36:42.821]  Uh, which popes?
[01:36:42.821 --> 01:36:44.682]  So-called popes had boyfriends?
[01:36:44.682 --> 01:36:52.129]  Well, uh, Paul VI, uh, was a gentleman, uh, if I may use the term loosely, an Italian actor named Carlini.
[01:36:53.277 --> 01:36:58.600]  Very handsome man, used to dye his hair red, which I suppose I should take as a compliment.
[01:36:58.600 --> 01:37:08.226]  But he was not, he could come in and out of the Vatican at any time he pleased.
[01:37:08.226 --> 01:37:14.350]  And I've spoken to a man who was there and saw this happening.
[01:37:14.350 --> 01:37:16.151]  He was a member of the Vatican
[01:37:18.125 --> 01:37:19.126]  What would you call it?
[01:37:19.126 --> 01:37:20.587]  The guards.
[01:37:20.587 --> 01:37:28.271]  He was there in a position where he could have stopped this man if he hadn't had orders not to.
[01:37:28.271 --> 01:37:28.791]  Who else?
[01:37:28.791 --> 01:37:31.533]  What other so-called Pope was involved in this?
[01:37:31.533 --> 01:37:38.176]  Well, I hate to do this without... What would you call it?
[01:37:38.176 --> 01:37:41.078]  Going into it in detail and proofing it.
[01:37:41.078 --> 01:37:43.880]  Yeah.
[01:37:43.880 --> 01:37:46.441]  It's a terribly destructive thing and if you have no way to
[01:37:47.054 --> 01:37:49.157]  Right off hand to prove it.
[01:37:49.157 --> 01:37:49.919]  Oh, I understand then.
[01:37:49.919 --> 01:37:51.060]  Let's not go there.
[01:37:51.060 --> 01:37:54.306]  I mean, but we see the same thing in the White House, Republican and Democratic Party.
[01:37:54.306 --> 01:37:55.027]  It's like Foley
[01:37:56.034 --> 01:38:06.302]  The congressman running the Missing Children and Exploited Children program, and then you've got two deputy heads of Homeland Security caught raping or trying to rape children.
[01:38:06.302 --> 01:38:09.445]  You've got Bohemian Grove, the Franklin cover-up, Skull and Bones.
[01:38:09.445 --> 01:38:15.730]  You've got even the New York Post reporting, quote, top gay porn star service moguls at Bohemian Grove.
[01:38:15.730 --> 01:38:18.252]  This, I guess, is part of this Illuminati religion
[01:38:19.432 --> 01:38:24.134]  I guess it's a rite of passage, so they know you're compromised, that you be involved in this.
[01:38:24.134 --> 01:38:26.515]  I think even bigger than just Freemasonry.
[01:38:26.515 --> 01:38:31.317]  And again, I'm not saying most masons are low-level and don't even know what's going on, but high-level folks.
[01:38:31.317 --> 01:38:35.399]  But it seems like it is a rite of passage to do... I mean, I guess it's kind of like a low-level...
[01:38:36.779 --> 01:38:46.207]  A street gang will go, you know, mug an old lady as a rite of passage, so they know you're really a member of the crew, or the mafia, you've got to kill two people to be a made member.
[01:38:46.207 --> 01:38:47.668]  I mean, is this a way to get made?
[01:38:47.668 --> 01:38:52.953]  I mean, why is this so prolific and it seems to be a prerequisite?
[01:38:52.953 --> 01:39:03.682]  Well, for one thing, I suppose you recall Della Dodd, who was a member of the Communist Party, who returned to Catholicism and then
[01:39:04.922 --> 01:39:16.828]  Let it be known that she personally had put 1,100 or was it 1,200 people, students into Catholic seminaries to study for the priesthood.
[01:39:16.828 --> 01:39:25.231]  And when she mentioned this in the 60s, she said they're about running the church now, these people.
[01:39:25.231 --> 01:39:26.932]  And we have this law of Pius V, which really
[01:39:31.095 --> 01:39:34.296]  He puts the homosexual out of the business.
[01:39:34.296 --> 01:39:37.098]  He can't do anything in the church.
[01:39:37.098 --> 01:39:47.902]  And he should be turned over to the civil authority, and the civil authority at the time simply killed him.
[01:39:47.902 --> 01:39:51.164]  So, this law was not included in this 1917-18 code.
[01:39:51.164 --> 01:39:57.427]  And so we have to wonder about the people that put the code in.
[01:39:57.427 --> 01:39:59.968]  Rampolla, Gaspari, Benedict XV,
[01:40:02.523 --> 01:40:05.385]  But clearly they wanted it so they could then blackmail.
[01:40:05.385 --> 01:40:08.027]  It's the same thing that's happening today.
[01:40:08.027 --> 01:40:17.953]  Now, what is the overall agenda now that these globalists have fully gotten control of the Catholic Church?
[01:40:17.953 --> 01:40:21.416]  I mean, where is all this going, Hutton?
[01:40:21.416 --> 01:40:29.621]  Well, they've managed to destroy any respect that most people have for the clergy.
[01:40:30.416 --> 01:40:33.237]  And especially the hierarchy.
[01:40:33.237 --> 01:40:48.163]  There's a gentleman in Illinois, Stephen Brady, who puts out a report every now and then called A.M.D.G., Ad Maiorem Dei Gloriam, for the greater glory of God.
[01:40:48.163 --> 01:40:56.726]  And he has been fighting these queers, these homosexuals, in the clergy and in the hierarchy.
[01:40:59.991 --> 01:41:10.503]  He can draw very readily, I'm led to believe by his investigation, that 70% of the American Catholic bishops are queer.
[01:41:14.147 --> 01:41:18.931]  Well, I would specify and be specific on that, though.
[01:41:18.931 --> 01:41:21.634]  This is a prerequisite for blackmail.
[01:41:21.634 --> 01:41:33.687]  So people out there listening, whatever their view on this is, the point is, this is being done strategically to control the Republican Party, the Democratic Party, and this is a club, then.
[01:41:33.687 --> 01:41:35.769]  They only let their people in.
[01:41:36.209 --> 01:41:40.273]  They let in the blackmailable people, so they will do what they're damn well told, right?
[01:41:57.265 --> 01:42:07.971]  Hutton is simply stating the fact that 70% from the research of the bishops are involved in this, and I've seen it from my own research.
[01:42:07.971 --> 01:42:09.812]  I totally agree with that.
[01:42:09.812 --> 01:42:12.354]  I would say more than half of the Republican leadership is.
[01:42:13.417 --> 01:42:14.198]  Yeah, that's true.
[01:42:38.191 --> 01:42:48.459]  What percentage from the research, if 70% are homosexual, what percentage are involved in going after the older boys?
[01:42:48.459 --> 01:42:55.364]  Of the 70% that are queer, yeah, I would say 100%.
[01:42:55.364 --> 01:42:58.025]  Because that's much worse.
[01:42:58.025 --> 01:43:01.148]  You can blackmail people better that way.
[01:43:01.148 --> 01:43:07.132]  These days it seems to be no crime to throw up your orders and say, well, I can't stand this celibacy and go away.
[01:43:08.857 --> 01:43:19.545]  But that's something else again, and as you mentioned in the case of the government, people are promoted because they can be told what they must do.
[01:43:19.545 --> 01:43:23.689]  It's amazing.
[01:43:23.689 --> 01:43:32.315]  Would you advise somebody then to put somebody in a mainstream so-called Catholic school or system if there's this many perverts floating around in there?
[01:43:32.315 --> 01:43:33.416]  I would not.
[01:43:33.416 --> 01:43:36.479]  I think it's one of the worst things you can do these days.
[01:43:36.479 --> 01:43:38.020]  At least if you're in a public school,
[01:43:38.795 --> 01:43:49.438]  While it is dumbed down and perverted, it is not officially anti-Catholic.
[01:43:49.438 --> 01:43:51.499]  It's all religion, of course.
[01:43:51.499 --> 01:44:03.102]  You can't bring up religion in this place unless you sneak the Bible in as a history book or a literature.
[01:44:03.102 --> 01:44:04.983]  I have a fine example of good writing.
[01:44:05.759 --> 01:44:08.382]  But that's not all the Bibles you see these days.
[01:44:08.382 --> 01:44:11.905]  Some of them are pretty wretched.
[01:44:11.905 --> 01:44:13.327]  Well, you're absolutely right.
[01:44:13.327 --> 01:44:19.032]  So, bottom line, it's compromised, it's blackmailed, regardless of people's political views or social views.
[01:44:19.032 --> 01:44:20.814]  The point is, this is going on.
[01:44:20.814 --> 01:44:21.775]  This is happening.
[01:44:21.775 --> 01:44:24.037]  They're using it to blackmail the White House.
[01:44:24.037 --> 01:44:25.178]  This is system-wide.
[01:44:26.145 --> 01:44:34.091]  And it's gotten so bad that as I keep reporting, Dyncor and Halliburton can be in the Chicago Tribune running child kidnapping rings and no one gets in trouble.
[01:44:34.091 --> 01:44:35.913]  I mean, this is so big.
[01:44:35.913 --> 01:44:36.913]  What is their goal?
[01:44:36.913 --> 01:44:45.320]  I mean, you know, one child policy, breaking up the family, society's degenerating, every major organization's been infiltrated or compromised or completely taken over.
[01:44:45.820 --> 01:44:47.001]  Well, it's heading straight for the end.
[01:44:47.001 --> 01:44:50.604]  I don't know how long it's going to take, but unless we can get our church back some way...
[01:45:13.800 --> 01:45:14.120]  I don't know.
[01:45:36.012 --> 01:45:40.035]  I mean, it's clear that this has been designed to destroy that institution, and it has.
[01:45:40.035 --> 01:45:42.597]  The membership's falling off, it's falling apart.
[01:45:42.597 --> 01:45:45.079]  What would you say to those that are still part of this system?
[01:45:45.706 --> 01:45:47.447]  What would you say to those who are in denial?
[01:45:47.447 --> 01:45:54.030]  I mean, when Ratzinger's up there saying one world government, new world order, one world religion, I mean, it doesn't get any clearer.
[01:45:54.030 --> 01:45:56.692]  That's in clear, clear English.
[01:45:56.692 --> 01:45:58.413]  He's clearly saying it.
[01:45:58.413 --> 01:45:59.613]  That's true enough.
[01:45:59.613 --> 01:46:05.216]  I mean, I don't know how people could deny... It's also in clear German and Italian and whatever else you can think of.
[01:46:05.216 --> 01:46:13.680]  It used to come out in Latin and then nobody knew what he was talking about.
[01:46:13.680 --> 01:46:14.541]  We have to say
[01:46:15.071 --> 01:46:17.333]  To those people.
[01:46:17.333 --> 01:46:19.594]  Whom do you follow?
[01:46:19.594 --> 01:46:23.237]  Why do you listen to these people?
[01:46:23.237 --> 01:46:26.999]  How is it possible that this man is a Pope?
[01:46:26.999 --> 01:46:28.320]  Because that's what they do.
[01:46:28.320 --> 01:46:29.501]  They're infallible.
[01:46:29.501 --> 01:46:33.523]  They hold the office and therefore they can do no wrong.
[01:46:33.523 --> 01:46:37.066]  Logically or... I mean, they carry it too far.
[01:46:37.066 --> 01:46:40.568]  Because his infallibility is limited to
[01:46:43.248 --> 01:46:46.870]  The articles of faith and to the morals.
[01:46:46.870 --> 01:46:52.092]  That means the implementation of the basic foundation of the Bible, the canons.
[01:46:52.092 --> 01:46:58.515]  Yes, and whatever the church has taken from tradition, from Christ and his apostles.
[01:46:59.318 --> 01:47:01.679]  Tradition is not what comes later.
[01:47:01.679 --> 01:47:12.506]  Well, isn't it, uh, Hutton Gibson, I mean, this is really like bank robbers dressing up like police to go rob the bank, and then everybody submits to them and says, well, they're wearing the uniform, they must be cops.
[01:47:12.506 --> 01:47:21.632]  Yeah, well, you have to figure there are such things in the world as oxymorons.
[01:47:21.632 --> 01:47:27.215]  We have what you could call mutually exclusive concepts.
[01:47:28.863 --> 01:47:34.165]  And since these men are on record as promoting heresy, they cannot be Catholic.
[01:47:34.165 --> 01:47:37.126]  And if they are not Catholic, they cannot be Pope.
[01:47:37.126 --> 01:47:41.727]  We have not had an eligible Pope since Pius XII.
[01:47:41.727 --> 01:47:44.268]  Now there's a big debate about when the New World Order
[01:47:45.570 --> 01:47:57.539]  We know it was always in there and doing things, but when the New World Order fully took control of the entire Catholic apparatchik, at least its more modern Masonic version, and there's a big debate raging about that.
[01:47:57.539 --> 01:48:05.504]  From your research and the other scholars you confer with, and your trips to Rome, and your research, what have you discovered?
[01:48:05.504 --> 01:48:08.947]  When can you mark the point they really had control?
[01:48:08.947 --> 01:48:14.651]  What they did was call this Vatican Council 2.
[01:48:15.253 --> 01:48:18.274]  For which there was no reason.
[01:48:18.274 --> 01:48:28.779]  If there were any reasons, there might have been three things that would call for something like that, and they did not rule on any one of them.
[01:48:28.779 --> 01:48:31.961]  And, uh... One of them was communism.
[01:48:31.961 --> 01:48:35.322]  One of them was contraception.
[01:48:35.322 --> 01:48:36.943]  And one of them was usury.
[01:48:36.943 --> 01:48:40.365]  And they never said a word on any of these.
[01:48:40.365 --> 01:48:40.805]  Officially.
[01:48:45.551 --> 01:48:48.693]  Well, what is it going to take for people to figure out that Ratzinger's pure evil?
[01:48:48.693 --> 01:48:52.275]  Is he going to have to dress up in a devil outfit and dance around with a pitchfork?
[01:48:52.275 --> 01:48:53.376]  I don't think that'll do it.
[01:48:53.376 --> 01:48:58.059]  People do things like that all the time.
[01:48:58.059 --> 01:48:58.920]  Oh, man.
[01:48:58.920 --> 01:49:03.023]  I just... Well, I mean, that's the equivalent of calling for one world government, one world religion.
[01:49:03.023 --> 01:49:09.628]  Well, as far as... It should make a point with Catholics that the man is not a bishop.
[01:49:09.628 --> 01:49:10.628]  And there he is.
[01:49:10.628 --> 01:49:13.470]  His office is Bishop of Rome.
[01:49:13.470 --> 01:49:14.311]  And he's not a bishop.
[01:49:16.024 --> 01:49:25.007]  Because he went through a ceremony, which would never make anyone a bishop, which was brought in at the same time this new mass was brought in in 1969.
[01:49:25.007 --> 01:49:34.609]  So basically there was a hostile takeover, they'd already infiltrated long before, but there was a hostile takeover in 69, that's the key date?
[01:49:34.609 --> 01:49:44.112]  Well, that was pretty conclusive at that point, where they put us all, any priest that would look at that new mass and say,
[01:49:44.867 --> 01:49:47.851]  This is a mass?
[01:49:47.851 --> 01:49:53.758]  We'd have to deny all his education and the oaths that he took up on ordination.
[01:49:53.758 --> 01:49:58.805]  Hutton Gibson, I'm looking at a Southern Poverty Law Center quote intelligence report.
[01:49:58.805 --> 01:50:01.268]  Radical powerhouse, the Society of St.
[01:50:01.268 --> 01:50:03.310]  Pius V, or is that the 10th?
[01:50:04.136 --> 01:50:05.897]  Well, they're trying to isolate us.
[01:50:05.897 --> 01:50:07.277]  Put us into this right-wing corner.
[01:50:29.833 --> 01:50:35.596]  I've often wondered how I got out on this right wing, because I grew up right in the center of the church.
[01:50:35.596 --> 01:50:43.120]  And without a change of attitude, belief, practice, suddenly I'm out here on this right wing.
[01:50:43.120 --> 01:50:47.563]  And who's demonstrating as a right wing?
[01:50:47.563 --> 01:50:51.785]  All I'm doing is exactly what my ancestors did, right back to the time of St.
[01:50:51.785 --> 01:50:53.666]  Patrick.
[01:50:53.666 --> 01:50:58.549]  But it seems more and more, Hutton, that the establishment is losing control, the alternative media is exploding,
[01:50:59.312 --> 01:51:00.773]  Alternative films are exploding.
[01:51:00.773 --> 01:51:03.454]  It does seem that the pendulum is starting to swing back.
[01:51:03.454 --> 01:51:07.355]  Things are getting bad, but it does seem like people are waking up.
[01:51:07.355 --> 01:51:09.216]  Are you seeing that?
[01:51:09.216 --> 01:51:10.697]  Well, I hope they're waking up.
[01:51:10.697 --> 01:51:17.079]  I'm trying to help wake them up by talking in public for a change.
[01:51:17.079 --> 01:51:25.582]  I've been neglecting my duty because of the... See, there's certain people that are... They don't give a damn what I think.
[01:51:25.582 --> 01:51:26.563]  They're out after my son.
[01:51:28.231 --> 01:51:29.292]  Now, we understand that.
[01:51:29.292 --> 01:51:36.119]  Well, let's talk some more about that since you bring it up when we get back.
[01:51:36.119 --> 01:51:36.800]  It's here.
[01:51:36.800 --> 01:51:41.945]  After a year in production and traveling to distant lands, my new film, Terror Storm, is complete.
[01:51:41.945 --> 01:51:49.593]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that Western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[01:51:50.259 --> 01:51:57.722]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[01:51:57.722 --> 01:52:09.466]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, a White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[01:52:09.466 --> 01:52:13.408]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[01:52:13.408 --> 01:52:15.688]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[01:52:15.688 --> 01:52:19.450]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[01:54:40.995 --> 01:54:43.616]  Welcome back.
[01:54:43.616 --> 01:54:49.077]  The War Is Now is Hutton's newsletter.
[01:54:49.077 --> 01:54:50.878]  He's also written several books, pamphlets,
[01:54:51.850 --> 01:55:20.067]  and uh... one of them is the enemy is still here you can get his newsletter for five dollars a year and uh... you can uh... right to a c t write this down folks for this is traditional catholics catholics is a general public want to be informed by a scholar who's really studied this and it is scholarly it's heavy reading i've read it several times and read two of his books a c t p o box twenty seven pleasant
[01:55:20.996 --> 01:55:21.236]  Yeah.
[01:55:36.673 --> 01:55:37.113]  I think so.
[01:55:59.049 --> 01:55:59.450]  P.O.
[01:55:59.450 --> 01:56:06.095]  Box 27, Pleasant Unity PA 15676.
[01:56:06.095 --> 01:56:08.336]  Hutton, was all that accurate I just said?
[01:56:08.336 --> 01:56:09.477]  Correct.
[01:56:09.477 --> 01:56:20.866]  Let's get back, because you brought it up, and I'm being careful not to be too controversial here, and respect the fact that you trust this show to come on here after two and a half years, or I guess silence since 2004, really.
[01:56:20.866 --> 01:56:26.050]  But you said they want to get at your son through you.
[01:56:26.050 --> 01:56:27.451]  We hit the break, please continue.
[01:56:29.542 --> 01:56:34.644]  Well, I'm the whipping boy, I suppose.
[01:56:34.644 --> 01:56:41.586]  I'm responsible for anything he thinks, and anything he thinks must be what I think.
[01:56:41.586 --> 01:56:51.570]  You know, this general guilt by association, I guess you call it, or they used to call it McCarthyism.
[01:56:51.570 --> 01:56:52.630]  Well, he does.
[01:56:52.630 --> 01:56:56.652]  Mel does stick up for his dad, and he says that you're his biggest hero.
[01:56:57.939 --> 01:56:59.440]  That's very gratifying.
[01:56:59.440 --> 01:57:02.643]  I hadn't heard that one.
[01:57:02.643 --> 01:57:04.864]  I've seen it in a TV interview.
[01:57:04.864 --> 01:57:07.846]  I tell you, they did take out of context what you said.
[01:57:07.846 --> 01:57:09.147]  They did lie about what you said.
[01:57:09.147 --> 01:57:10.488]  They did all sorts of things.
[01:57:10.488 --> 01:57:15.472]  I got called by national television wanting to buy an interview you did here.
[01:57:15.472 --> 01:57:20.656]  I just told them where they could go so they could try to craft some things.
[01:57:20.656 --> 01:57:22.557]  It's just despicable.
[01:57:22.557 --> 01:57:24.539]  But again, like I said, people are waking up to this.
[01:57:24.539 --> 01:57:26.080]  They're not buying it anymore, Hutton.
[01:57:27.947 --> 01:57:29.908]  I hope not.
[01:57:29.908 --> 01:57:34.950]  But, uh, you mentioned the Southern Poverty Law Center.
[01:57:34.950 --> 01:57:35.870]  Yes.
[01:57:35.870 --> 01:57:42.533]  Isn't that the outfit that chased the Ten Commandments out of the Alabama State Court?
[01:57:42.533 --> 01:57:44.254]  Yes, that's what they do.
[01:57:44.254 --> 01:57:50.036]  They're here to destroy the country.
[01:57:50.036 --> 01:57:52.537]  And then Bush didn't even stand up for Judge Roy Moore.
[01:57:52.537 --> 01:57:53.998]  He sent a prosecutor down after him.
[01:57:57.631 --> 01:57:59.373]  Well, what do you expect?
[01:57:59.373 --> 01:58:03.397]  Isn't this the guy that... Oh, he's against abortion.
[01:58:03.397 --> 01:58:05.659]  And then he says, well, give me a bill.
[01:58:05.659 --> 01:58:06.280]  I'll sign it.
[01:58:06.280 --> 01:58:08.382]  He doesn't need a bill.
[01:58:08.382 --> 01:58:12.787]  He got this doggone Homeland Security thing through there because he wanted it.
[01:58:14.051 --> 01:58:26.855]  Well, remember three years ago you were on, right when The Passion of Christ was about to come out, and you told me about the Diane Sawyer interview before it even went on TV, that Mel said, you know where the WMDs... guess where I'm going to hide out after this movie comes out?
[01:58:26.855 --> 01:58:29.716]  I'm going to hide where the WMDs are hidden.
[01:58:29.716 --> 01:58:30.557]  Right.
[01:58:30.557 --> 01:58:32.417]  Because nobody can find me.
[01:58:32.417 --> 01:58:34.958]  Nobody will ever be able to find you.
[01:58:34.958 --> 01:58:36.839]  What do you think about their talk of attacking Iran?
[01:58:38.410 --> 01:58:40.011]  Well, they'll get to it.
[01:58:40.011 --> 01:58:41.452]  They don't throw these things up.
[01:58:41.452 --> 01:58:45.495]  It's a balloon, and then you get talked into it.
[01:58:45.495 --> 01:58:58.605]  People discover things that have happened, like, well, maybe 500 years ago, the Shah of Persia shot a Christian, or something, if he had a gun.
[01:58:58.605 --> 01:59:00.887]  I don't know about this.
[01:59:00.887 --> 01:59:01.808]  You suppose they had guns?
[01:59:03.626 --> 01:59:08.088]  Well, we're going to break for 70 seconds and come back and do just five more minutes with Hutton Gibson.
[01:59:08.088 --> 01:59:09.408]  Always interesting to talk to him.
[01:59:09.408 --> 01:59:12.789]  We'll be right back.
[01:59:12.789 --> 01:59:17.030]  If you would like a copy of this show, come to GCNlive.com and reserve it today.

[01:59:26.901 --> 01:59:27.601]  are located?
[01:59:27.601 --> 01:59:31.222]  And do you know the locations of the top 300 prime terrorist targets?
[01:59:31.222 --> 01:59:36.204]  You can find these answers and more in the new interactive CD book, Fruit in Places USA.

[02:00:34.188 --> 02:00:35.489]  Big Brother.
[02:00:35.489 --> 02:00:37.270]  Mainstream media.
[02:00:37.270 --> 02:00:39.031]  Government cover-ups.
[02:00:39.031 --> 02:00:40.612]  You want answers?
[02:00:40.612 --> 02:00:42.533]  Well, so does he.
[02:00:42.533 --> 02:00:46.335]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:46.335 --> 02:00:50.458]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:52.288 --> 02:01:05.758]  All right, coming up at the end of this hour, I'm going to get into the Illuminati, the Masons, their occultic activities, and in, I mean, even Keith Ullman's gone on national TV and said Bush is engaging in human sacrifice over
[02:01:07.235 --> 02:01:26.299]  In Iraq, we're going to play that clip, and I was talking to one of the anthropologists who lives here in Austin, a friend of mine, who's also a fan of the show, who was one of the anthropologists on Apocalypto, and she was talking about how, and Mel's actually said it publicly, too, in some interviews, but on the set he was talking about how, you know, this is human sacrifice.
[02:01:26.299 --> 02:01:29.380]  But now even Keith Olbermann's saying it.
[02:01:29.380 --> 02:01:34.081]  Do you agree with that, Hutton, that, I mean, this is a weird form of human sacrifice over there?
[02:01:34.970 --> 02:01:38.631]  Absolutely, we have no business there.
[02:01:38.631 --> 02:01:42.253]  But, I mean, Bush says we must have more sacrifice.
[02:01:42.253 --> 02:01:55.038]  Well, yeah, well, let's... I would appreciate it more if he had been right there in the Army when they wanted him, or in the Air Force, wherever he was supposed to be.
[02:01:55.038 --> 02:01:57.419]  Or if his daughters were enlisting right now.
[02:01:57.419 --> 02:01:58.279]  Yeah, that would help.
[02:01:59.082 --> 02:02:01.223]  Or some of the members of his family.
[02:02:01.223 --> 02:02:03.364]  What are you going to do if they try to re-institute the draft?
[02:02:03.364 --> 02:02:09.886]  I mean, you left the U.S., you said, pretty much because of that in the late 60s.
[02:02:09.886 --> 02:02:16.368]  What's the family planning if they try a draft now of all those grandkids?
[02:02:16.368 --> 02:02:19.189]  Well, to start with, 28 of them are in Australia.
[02:02:19.189 --> 02:02:23.251]  They can't get rid of them.
[02:02:23.251 --> 02:02:26.632]  After that, it's anybody's guess.
[02:02:28.334 --> 02:02:30.955]  Hutton, in closing, anything else you want to add?
[02:02:30.955 --> 02:02:44.499]  And why did you decide, after two and a half years of silence, I guess the last time I interviewed you on air you were about 86, now you're 88, why are you now deciding to go public again?
[02:02:44.499 --> 02:02:46.119]  Well, I'm shirking my duty.
[02:02:46.119 --> 02:02:50.441]  I've got to get this stuff out about the church.
[02:02:50.441 --> 02:02:55.022]  And it doesn't make any difference for what else I'm supposed to have said or thought.
[02:02:56.355 --> 02:03:00.978]  Uh, we got the Thought Police going, of course.
[02:03:00.978 --> 02:03:04.920]  They've got all this hate crimes legislation they're trying to pass to restrict free speech.
[02:03:04.920 --> 02:03:06.661]  Oh, yeah.
[02:03:06.661 --> 02:03:11.724]  Pre-thought to.
[02:03:11.724 --> 02:03:23.731]  But, for instance, now, our friendly Ratzinger has decided that he will give us his kind, loving permission to have a mass back.
[02:03:25.117 --> 02:03:26.418]  But he's not doing that.
[02:03:26.418 --> 02:03:31.862]  He's giving us a 1962 change of John 23rd.
[02:03:31.862 --> 02:03:37.567]  So basically... But again, that shows they're at least trying to camouflage what they're doing a little bit more.
[02:03:37.567 --> 02:03:43.631]  That shows that the traditionalist movement, or as you call it, the orthodox movement, is exploding.
[02:03:43.631 --> 02:03:44.672]  I mean, is it not?
[02:03:44.672 --> 02:03:46.573]  Well, they're trying to break it up, you see.
[02:03:46.573 --> 02:03:49.456]  Some people will settle for just the mass.
[02:03:49.456 --> 02:03:50.036]  I won't.
[02:03:50.036 --> 02:03:51.157]  I want the whole church back.
[02:03:52.968 --> 02:03:56.632]  They won't have the mass anyway because they have nobody that can say it.
[02:03:56.632 --> 02:04:01.937]  The priests ordained, suppose at least in 69, are not priests.
[02:04:01.937 --> 02:04:06.922]  And what they then participate in, if it weren't right in the right already, is idolatry.
[02:04:08.288 --> 02:04:31.407]  Well, Hutton, you've done amazing work with others towards exposing this takeover and this evil, and it does show that individuals highly motivated can have an effect, and you have had a life well lived and are still doing wonderful work, and I know you're going to be around with us for a long time to come, my friend, and I hope we can avert an attack on Iran and a draft and the rest of it, but I think if they try that, it's going to be the beginning of the end for them.
[02:04:31.407 --> 02:04:34.810]  I think they can push too far.
[02:04:34.810 --> 02:04:36.672]  Yeah, well, they'll push too far.
[02:04:37.884 --> 02:04:42.027]  Because they're after a certain thing.
[02:04:42.027 --> 02:04:44.028]  Homogenization.
[02:04:44.028 --> 02:04:46.489]  Everybody's got to be the same.
[02:04:46.489 --> 02:04:49.231]  Otherwise we won't make good slaves.
[02:04:49.231 --> 02:04:53.193]  That goes in the church, especially.
[02:04:53.193 --> 02:04:55.795]  So if we get the church back, we have a chance at the other.
[02:04:55.795 --> 02:05:00.498]  I don't know what chance we can have with the government.
[02:05:00.498 --> 02:05:03.100]  But I'm working as well as I can on the church.
[02:05:03.100 --> 02:05:04.160]  You keep it up!
[02:05:04.160 --> 02:05:04.881]  HuttonGibson.com
[02:05:08.064 --> 02:05:10.146]  And we've got a link up on the site to his P.O.
[02:05:10.146 --> 02:05:13.130]  Box to get his newsletter, $5 a year.
[02:05:13.130 --> 02:05:14.692]  Hutton, thank you for coming on again.
[02:05:14.692 --> 02:05:17.114]  I'm honored you chose this program to go public again.
[02:05:17.114 --> 02:05:18.596]  We'll talk to you soon, my friend.
[02:05:18.596 --> 02:05:19.557]  Thank you.
[02:05:19.557 --> 02:05:20.678]  Take care.
[02:05:20.678 --> 02:05:21.920]  There goes Hutton Gibson.
[02:05:21.920 --> 02:05:23.662]  We'll be right back with the news and a lot more.
[02:05:32.913 --> 02:05:38.740]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands, my new film Terror Storm is complete.
[02:05:38.740 --> 02:05:46.388]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[02:05:47.068 --> 02:05:54.532]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[02:05:54.532 --> 02:06:06.258]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, a White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[02:06:06.258 --> 02:06:10.221]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[02:06:10.221 --> 02:06:12.482]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[02:06:12.482 --> 02:06:16.324]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.
[02:06:24.650 --> 02:06:32.695]  The War on Terrorism.
[02:06:32.695 --> 02:06:35.758]  Will it be fought overseas or will it affect us here at home?
[02:06:35.758 --> 02:06:40.341]  If you are like most folks, you want to be prepared, but can't afford an underground shelter.
[02:06:40.341 --> 02:06:41.482]  So what do you do?
[02:06:41.482 --> 02:06:46.045]  Did you know that you can use your home as a shelter against fallout and biological or chemical attacks?
[02:06:46.525 --> 02:06:49.146]  With a little know-how, it's not that difficult.
[02:06:49.146 --> 02:07:03.890]  Sheltering in Place, Surviving Acts of Terrorism from Biological, Chemical, and Radioactive Fallout, developed by Wayne LeBaron, a health physicist who has served as a specialist in environmental health, communicable diseases, and has worked as a nuclear specialist for the U.S.
[02:07:03.890 --> 02:07:10.932]  government, gives you easy-to-follow video instructions, and walks you step-by-step through the process of preparing your home as a shelter.

[02:07:29.441 --> 02:07:31.922]  Attention, attention everyone!
[02:07:31.922 --> 02:07:34.464]  A brand new invention just released.
[02:07:34.464 --> 02:07:39.146]  It's called Wrist Ease, the new patented portable ergonomic wrist support.
[02:07:39.827 --> 02:07:47.168]  Wristease comforts your wrists from the sometimes painful tasks of typing, writing, using a mouse or adding machine.

[02:08:00.050 --> 02:08:04.931]  Wristease is perfect for children doing homework or playing video games.
[02:08:04.931 --> 02:08:08.912]  Wristease provides the proper comfort and support for all ages and
[02:08:09.492 --> 02:08:15.397]  Wristease provides comfort for victims of carpal tunnel syndrome and other repetitive injuries.

[02:08:34.469 --> 02:08:35.769]  Big Brother.
[02:08:35.769 --> 02:08:37.550]  Mainstream media.
[02:08:37.550 --> 02:08:39.310]  Government cover-ups.
[02:08:39.310 --> 02:08:40.890]  You want answers?
[02:08:40.890 --> 02:08:41.830]  Well, so does he.
[02:08:41.830 --> 02:08:46.611]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:08:46.611 --> 02:08:51.312]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:08:51.312 --> 02:08:57.653]  I'm gonna get into Keith Elberman's piece from a few weeks ago about sacrifice, human sacrifice, what the war is all about.
[02:08:57.653 --> 02:09:00.854]  And I wanted to integrate it with just a clip.
[02:09:00.854 --> 02:09:02.374]  It's not as powerful without the video.
[02:09:03.351 --> 02:09:06.152]  From a special report we did in England.
[02:09:06.152 --> 02:09:08.253]  Footage we shot but never used.
[02:09:08.253 --> 02:09:09.234]  Footage in Canada.
[02:09:09.234 --> 02:09:11.255]  Footage in Austin.
[02:09:11.255 --> 02:09:11.995]  Just a few weeks ago.
[02:09:11.995 --> 02:09:15.957]  The other stuff's from a year ago and then a few months ago.
[02:09:15.957 --> 02:09:21.359]  Just everywhere we go, there are these occultic monuments.
[02:09:21.359 --> 02:09:23.581]  And it ties into the quote, cult of sacrifice.
[02:09:23.581 --> 02:09:28.483]  Before we do that, if you want to find out about the cult of sacrifice, the order of death, get my film, The Order of Death.
[02:09:28.483 --> 02:09:30.864]  It's a 46 minute documentary.
[02:09:31.664 --> 02:09:41.291]  And then on the same DVD is my original two-hour film, Dark Secrets Inside Bohemian Grove, re-edited, updated, and re-cut.
[02:09:41.291 --> 02:09:47.135]  Okay, so you get those two films on one DVD.
[02:09:47.135 --> 02:09:47.916]  The Order of Death.
[02:09:47.916 --> 02:09:50.077]  People get confused by this.
[02:09:50.077 --> 02:09:51.979]  They say, what is it, one film or two films?
[02:09:51.979 --> 02:09:54.240]  It's two films on one disc.
[02:09:54.240 --> 02:09:58.023]  There's the updated original from 2000, when I stuck it in Bohemian Grove with Mike Hanson.
[02:09:58.613 --> 02:10:03.755]  And then we had an employee snuck back in in 2005, got all this footage.
[02:10:03.755 --> 02:10:05.475]  We put it all together in 2006.
[02:10:05.475 --> 02:10:07.056]  It's the Order of Death.
[02:10:07.056 --> 02:10:07.656]  It's amazing.
[02:10:07.656 --> 02:10:17.039]  And then it has the whole other dark secrets inside Bohemian Grove updated with new information and remastered and enhanced.
[02:10:17.039 --> 02:10:21.180]  Some of the scenes are... Because before, you know, I had this little camera on my side and it was at an angle.
[02:10:21.180 --> 02:10:24.502]  And we leave the raw footage in there, but then we also blow it up.
[02:10:24.502 --> 02:10:25.542]  And it's just amazing.
[02:10:26.970 --> 02:10:28.291]  That is $19.95.
[02:10:28.291 --> 02:10:30.133]  Two films, one DVD, $19.95.
[02:10:30.133 --> 02:10:32.775]  Take my Police State Trilogy.
[02:10:32.775 --> 02:10:35.178]  My first seven films I made were only on VHS.
[02:10:35.178 --> 02:10:37.400]  I never had time to get around to put them on DVD.
[02:10:37.400 --> 02:10:41.243]  Now, Police State 2000, Police State 2 The Takeover, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[02:10:41.243 --> 02:10:43.185]  Three different discs, one DVD case, $34.95.
[02:10:43.185 --> 02:10:44.246]  Normally $60 for that.
[02:10:44.246 --> 02:10:44.707]  You get it for $34.95.
[02:10:51.252 --> 02:10:52.334]  Slashing prices.
[02:10:52.334 --> 02:10:54.677]  45% off.
[02:10:54.677 --> 02:11:04.789]  And the other films, The Masters of Terror, Matrix of Evil, America Destroyed by Design, Comprehensive Annual Financial Reports, Exposed.
[02:11:04.789 --> 02:11:06.031]  My original seven films.
[02:11:07.725 --> 02:11:10.727]  Now available on DVD at Infowars.com.
[02:11:10.727 --> 02:11:13.869]  You can also get my new film, Terror Storm, the history of government-sponsored terror.
[02:11:13.869 --> 02:11:15.550]  Such an incredibly important film.
[02:11:15.550 --> 02:11:19.453]  If you haven't gotten it, or you just watched it online, get the DVD.
[02:11:19.453 --> 02:11:20.534]  Make copies from it.
[02:11:20.534 --> 02:11:21.334]  Show it to people.
[02:11:21.334 --> 02:11:23.076]  It's high quality.
[02:11:23.076 --> 02:11:25.017]  It cost me almost $100,000 to make it.
[02:11:25.017 --> 02:11:27.359]  That's a lot for me.
[02:11:27.359 --> 02:11:29.240]  Get Terror Storm, folks.
[02:11:29.947 --> 02:11:30.768]  Please.
[02:11:30.768 --> 02:11:37.659]  And by the way, when you get America Freedom to Fascism for $19.95, Aaron Russo's blockbuster, you can get Terror Storm for $9.95.
[02:11:37.659 --> 02:11:39.502]  There's a bunch of discounts like that.
[02:11:39.502 --> 02:11:41.545]  9-11 inside job t-shirts for $9.95.
[02:11:43.307 --> 02:11:47.012]  There's just so much on InfoWars.com, and we do need your support.
[02:11:47.012 --> 02:11:49.335]  I have a lot of staff now compared to what I used to have.
[02:11:49.335 --> 02:11:53.780]  We're having bigger and bigger effects every day, but we also need your support.
[02:11:53.780 --> 02:11:59.908]  So, you not only get powerful books and videos on the online secure shopping cart for the video and bookstore,
[02:12:00.823 --> 02:12:04.165]  You also support us and make everything we're doing possible.
[02:12:04.165 --> 02:12:06.366]  You can also call the toll-free number and order 1-888-253-3139.
[02:12:06.366 --> 02:12:07.527]  Don't wait, support us!
[02:12:07.527 --> 02:12:08.187]  888-253-3139.
[02:12:08.187 --> 02:12:11.529]  You can also write to us at 3001 South Lamar, L-A-M-A-R, Suite 100, Austin, TX 78704.
[02:12:28.866 --> 02:12:30.429]  Please don't procrastinate.
[02:12:30.429 --> 02:12:34.556]  You can wake up so many people with these films, even if you know all about this stuff.
[02:12:34.556 --> 02:12:40.266]  That's even better, because then you can talk to people and give them the films, get them for others, make copies of my films.
[02:12:40.945 --> 02:12:41.665]  Thank you for watching.
[02:12:59.476 --> 02:13:01.518]  And I know I could sell them for more.
[02:13:01.518 --> 02:13:04.800]  It doesn't even seem when I lowered prices it made us sell more.
[02:13:04.800 --> 02:13:07.902]  Maybe I should raise them so we can fund our operation.
[02:13:07.902 --> 02:13:13.266]  But I wanted to make them as inexpensive as possible so you can get more and spread more.
[02:13:13.266 --> 02:13:15.447]  That is the goal.
[02:13:15.447 --> 02:13:18.629]  That is what we're about at the end of the day.
[02:13:18.629 --> 02:13:25.574]  So please take action and go to InfoWars.com and order it off a secure shopping cart or call the toll free number or get a PrisonPlanet.tv membership.
[02:13:26.317 --> 02:13:32.723]  PrisonPlanet.tv is an unbelievably powerful information warfare tool against the globalists.
[02:13:32.723 --> 02:13:34.145]  All 15 of my films.
[02:13:34.145 --> 02:13:37.468]  There's got to be 40 or 50 other films that have been authorized to post by other people.
[02:13:39.111 --> 02:13:40.512]  Hundreds of my weekly TV reports.
[02:13:40.512 --> 02:13:44.613]  There's got to be 50, 60 special video reports I did out in the field.
[02:13:44.613 --> 02:13:47.335]  We've been doing like three or four reports a week for you.
[02:13:47.335 --> 02:13:50.376]  I mean out in the field, in studio, interviews.
[02:13:50.376 --> 02:13:52.497]  It's getting crazier and crazier.
[02:13:52.497 --> 02:13:56.258]  Thousands and thousands of pieces of media at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[02:13:56.258 --> 02:13:57.459]  All my best audio interviews.
[02:13:57.999 --> 02:14:02.260]  When you're a member of PrisonPlanet.tv, you can just go there and burn them all to disk.
[02:14:02.260 --> 02:14:03.860]  I mean, get them in super high bandwidth.
[02:14:03.860 --> 02:14:05.480]  You're not going to find that anywhere else.
[02:14:05.480 --> 02:14:08.781]  And burn them to disk and give them to people, and it's almost DVD quality.
[02:14:08.781 --> 02:14:10.901]  It's not as good, but it's almost as good.
[02:14:10.901 --> 02:14:11.921]  Great activist tool.
[02:14:11.921 --> 02:14:13.522]  You should really be using that.
[02:14:13.522 --> 02:14:21.283]  And in closing, I would ask you, the listeners, it's up to you to help us reach more people.
[02:14:21.283 --> 02:14:25.084]  And I think we're doing the best analysis, the best work out there, frankly.
[02:14:25.084 --> 02:14:27.144]  Please tell your whole email list daily.
[02:14:28.223 --> 02:14:30.264]  Go on the message boards.
[02:14:30.264 --> 02:14:32.105]  Go on the posting boards.
[02:14:32.105 --> 02:14:35.147]  Go into the universities.
[02:14:35.147 --> 02:14:36.247]  Hand out flyers.
[02:14:36.247 --> 02:14:43.211]  Tell them about PrisonPlanet.com and InfoWars.com.
[02:14:43.211 --> 02:14:48.853]  And then we've got sites like Jones Report that are low graphics for those that are still on dial-up.
[02:14:48.853 --> 02:14:49.894]  JonesReport.com.
[02:14:50.902 --> 02:14:52.883]  It is so important that you do.
[02:14:52.883 --> 02:14:54.223]  And I know a lot of you are doing that.
[02:14:54.223 --> 02:14:55.583]  That's why we reach millions of people.
[02:14:55.583 --> 02:14:57.064]  But let's redouble that.
[02:14:57.064 --> 02:15:00.905]  And let's not just count on those that have been fighting hard, who I salute and I commend and I thank.
[02:15:00.905 --> 02:15:02.065]  I see what you do.
[02:15:02.065 --> 02:15:02.906]  Thank you.
[02:15:02.906 --> 02:15:05.927]  For the country, my children, your family, everybody.
[02:15:05.927 --> 02:15:08.107]  Thank you for being committed.
[02:15:08.107 --> 02:15:12.289]  For those of you out there who aren't committed, who don't do a lot, you need to get in the fight.
[02:15:12.289 --> 02:15:13.529]  We're giving you ways to do it.
[02:15:14.753 --> 02:15:17.237]  So I want you for the fight against the New World Order.
[02:15:17.237 --> 02:15:21.062]  I'm asking you to enlist, ladies and gentlemen, and to help us.
[02:15:21.062 --> 02:15:24.848]  So please promote PrisonPlanet.com and InfoWars.com.
[02:15:24.848 --> 02:15:29.194]  And tell everybody you know about the free podcast daily.
[02:15:29.194 --> 02:15:30.056]  When this show ends,
[02:15:30.848 --> 02:15:34.190]  About 30 minutes after the show ends, it serves as a podcast.
[02:15:34.190 --> 02:15:55.845]  You just go click subscribe, it loads into your mp3, and then you click on it, you've got a regular mp3, you've got an iPod, you click on another link, and it downloads it, and then you subscribe, and every day, five days a week, you get the three-hour show delivered to your mp3, and you can listen to it whenever you want on the exercise bike, or on the bus, or on a plane, or at lunch,
[02:15:57.106 --> 02:16:02.091]  It's such an important tool in the fight of the podcast.
[02:16:02.091 --> 02:16:02.911]  There's two podcasts.
[02:16:02.911 --> 02:16:05.754]  There's one that Paul puts out like three or four interviews a week on.
[02:16:05.754 --> 02:16:07.575]  That's the Prison Planet podcast.
[02:16:07.575 --> 02:16:12.199]  But then there's the heavy-duty one that's free, where you just get the whole show every day.
[02:16:12.199 --> 02:16:16.923]  And then when you're done with it, you can erase it or you can archive it or put it on your computer.
[02:16:16.923 --> 02:16:17.644]  It's really important.
[02:16:18.547 --> 02:16:30.578]  Okay, here is Keith Olbermann talking about sacrifice, and because now we've got the numbers in, since the first wave of the surge, we have record troops dying, 27 in one weekend, and that's continuing through the week right now.
[02:16:30.578 --> 02:16:32.820]  So we're talking about 24 in one day.
[02:16:32.820 --> 02:16:35.182]  So here's Keith Olbermann, then we'll continue.
[02:16:35.182 --> 02:16:37.664]  Tonight a special comment about sacrifice.
[02:16:37.664 --> 02:16:43.530]  If in your presence an individual tried to sacrifice an American serviceman or woman, would you intervene?
[02:16:43.530 --> 02:16:44.691]  Would you at least protest?
[02:16:45.436 --> 02:16:48.518]  What if he had already sacrificed 3,003 of them?
[02:16:48.518 --> 02:16:55.522]  What if he had already sacrificed 3,003 of them and was then to announce his intention to sacrifice hundreds, maybe thousands more?
[02:16:56.138 --> 02:17:10.207]  This is where we stand tonight with the BBC report of President Bush's, quote, new Iraq strategy, unquote, and his impending speech to the nation, which, it quotes a senior American official as saying, will be about troop increases and sacrifice.
[02:17:10.207 --> 02:17:15.750]  The President has delayed, dawdled, deferred for the months since the release of the Iraq study group.
[02:17:15.750 --> 02:17:19.292]  He has seemingly heard out everybody and listened to none of them.
[02:17:19.292 --> 02:17:22.314]  If the BBC is right, and we can only pray it is not,
[02:17:23.015 --> 02:17:27.661]  He has settled on the only solution all the true experts agree cannot possibly work.
[02:17:27.661 --> 02:17:36.654]  More American personnel in Iraq, not as trainers for Iraqi troops, but as part of some flabby, ill-defined plan for sacrifice.
[02:17:37.609 --> 02:17:39.050]  Sacrifice.
[02:17:39.050 --> 02:17:42.392]  More American servicemen and women will have their lives risked.
[02:17:42.392 --> 02:17:45.794]  More American servicemen and women will have their lives ended.
[02:17:45.794 --> 02:17:50.817]  More American families will have to bear the unbearable and rationalize the unforgivable.
[02:17:50.817 --> 02:17:52.058]  Sacrifice.
[02:17:52.058 --> 02:17:53.438]  Sacrifice now.
[02:17:53.438 --> 02:17:54.959]  Sacrifice tomorrow.
[02:17:54.959 --> 02:17:56.120]  Sacrifice forever.
[02:17:56.793 --> 02:18:10.753]  And more Americans, more even than the two-thirds who already believe we need fewer troops in Iraq and not more, will have to conclude this president does not have any idea what he's doing, and that other Americans will have to die for that reason.
[02:18:11.488 --> 02:18:21.018]  It must now be branded as propaganda, for even the President cannot truly feel that very many people still believe him to be competent in this area, let alone the decider.
[02:18:21.018 --> 02:18:29.207]  But from our impeccable reporter at the Pentagon, Jim Miklaszewski, tonight comes confirmation of something called Surge and Accelerate.
[02:18:29.207 --> 02:18:33.192]  As many as 20,000 additional troops for political purposes.
[02:18:33.812 --> 02:18:46.669]  This in line with what we had previously heard, that this will be proclaimed a short-term measure for the stated purpose of increasing security in and around Baghdad and giving an Iraqi government a chance to establish some kind of order.
[02:18:48.024 --> 02:18:50.505]  This is palpable nonsense, Mr. Bush.
[02:18:50.505 --> 02:18:59.571]  If this is your intention, if the centerpiece of your announcement next week will be sacrifice, sacrifice your intention, not more American lives.
[02:18:59.571 --> 02:19:09.716]  As Senator Biden of Delaware has pointed out, the new troops might improve the ratio our forces face relative to those living in Baghdad, friend and foe, from 200 to 1 to just 100 to 1.
[02:19:09.716 --> 02:19:09.996]  Sacrifice?
[02:19:09.996 --> 02:19:10.377]  No.
[02:19:10.377 --> 02:19:10.817]  Drop in a bucket.
[02:19:16.934 --> 02:19:21.875]  The additional men and women you have sentenced to go there, sir, will serve only as targets.
[02:19:21.875 --> 02:19:24.376]  They will not be there short term, Mr. Bush.
[02:19:24.376 --> 02:19:27.837]  For many, it will mean a year or more in death's shadow.
[02:19:27.837 --> 02:19:29.978]  This is not temporary, Mr. Bush.
[02:19:29.978 --> 02:19:34.959]  For the Americans who will die because of you, it will be as permanent as it gets.
[02:19:36.092 --> 02:19:43.074]  The various rationales for what Mr. Bush will reportedly rechristen sacrifice constitute a very thin gruel indeed.
[02:19:43.074 --> 02:19:51.196]  The former Labor Secretary, Robert Reich, says Senator McCain told him that the surge would help the morale of the troops already in Iraq.
[02:19:51.196 --> 02:20:05.619]  If Mr. McCain truly said that, and truly believes it, he has either forgotten completely his own experience in Vietnam, or he is unaware of the recent Military Times poll indicating only 38% of our active military want to see more troops sent to Iraq.
[02:20:06.463 --> 02:20:09.585]  All that or Mr. McCain has departed from reality.
[02:20:09.585 --> 02:20:14.648]  Then there is the argument that to take any steps towards reducing troop numbers would show weakness to the enemy.
[02:20:14.648 --> 02:20:20.812]  When we get back, at the end he calls it human sacrifice and I'll play another clip and we'll cover a bunch of other news.
[02:20:20.812 --> 02:20:22.814]  A lot of important information coming up.
[02:20:22.814 --> 02:20:26.316]  Be sure and stay with us as the fight against tyranny continues.

[02:21:34.647 --> 02:21:41.193]  Did you know that the United Nations' basic philosophy is both anti-American and pro-dictatorship?
[02:21:41.193 --> 02:21:50.463]  Did you know that the United Nations was founded by Communist and Marxist members of the Council on Foreign Relations, whose goal is a socialistic one-world government?
[02:21:51.934 --> 02:22:02.034]  We would like to help you understand why these things are happening and how they fulfill Bible prophecy by offering you an absolutely free one-year subscription to Newswatch Magazine.

[02:22:31.508 --> 02:22:36.252]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson, here for the 2007 Red Book.
[02:22:36.252 --> 02:22:41.276]  The commodity markets like gold, silver, copper, aluminum and oil have exploded over the last year.
[02:22:41.276 --> 02:22:44.058]  This is a glaring testimony of how quickly the U.S.
[02:22:44.058 --> 02:22:46.520]  dollar can be devalued.
[02:22:46.520 --> 02:22:52.045]  Many have turned to precious metals to provide a safe haven while increasing the potential profits.
[02:22:52.045 --> 02:22:59.251]  Though accumulating precious metals has been a proven method for the storage of wealth, it is important that you understand the market you are getting into.
[02:23:00.282 --> 02:23:05.506]  Midas Resources is offering the Red Book and Silver Dollar for only $27.95.
[02:23:05.506 --> 02:23:09.949]  The Red Book is the number one best-selling guide to gold and silver coins.
[02:23:09.949 --> 02:23:11.470]  Call for your copy today.
[02:23:11.470 --> 02:23:14.732]  It's 800-686-2237.
[02:23:14.732 --> 02:23:21.276]  If you've already accumulated or plan to get into the precious metals market, you simply must have the Red Book in your library.
[02:23:21.276 --> 02:23:21.697]  Call 800-686-2237.
[02:23:21.697 --> 02:23:21.917]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[02:23:31.167 --> 02:23:35.511]  Did you ever wonder how an opera singer that hits a high note is able to shatter a wine glass?
[02:23:35.511 --> 02:23:37.533]  Well, the glass has a natural resonance.
[02:23:37.533 --> 02:23:44.119]  If the resonant frequency force making the glass vibrate is big enough, the size of the vibration will become so large that the glass shatters.
[02:23:44.119 --> 02:23:50.484]  Using this similar principle, Royal Raymond Rife discovered that diseased organisms can be destroyed using different resonant frequencies.
[02:23:50.484 --> 02:23:52.326]  The BioSolutions Frequency Instrument
[02:23:52.466 --> 02:23:53.026]  I think so.
[02:24:15.100 --> 02:24:16.262]  Eliminate the cause.
[02:24:16.262 --> 02:24:18.766]  For more information call BioSolutions toll free 1-866-885-6625.
[02:24:18.766 --> 02:24:19.187]  That's 1-866-885-6625.
[02:24:19.187 --> 02:24:19.247]  1-866-885-6625.
[02:24:32.975 --> 02:24:33.936]  Don't worry.
[02:24:33.936 --> 02:24:35.978]  This show is documented.
[02:24:35.978 --> 02:24:39.160]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:24:39.160 --> 02:24:43.083]  I fell into a burning ring of fire.
[02:24:43.083 --> 02:24:47.727]  I went down, down, down, and the flames went higher.
[02:24:47.727 --> 02:24:52.971]  And it burns, burns, burns, the ring of fire.
[02:24:52.971 --> 02:25:01.218]  In the interest of time, because the album and thing is like a ten minute clip, I'm just going to have John find the part.
[02:25:01.218 --> 02:25:02.039]  He has to watch it.
[02:25:04.192 --> 02:25:08.914]  And as soon as he finds it, just the part where he talks about this is all human sacrifice.
[02:25:08.914 --> 02:25:10.355]  Because I just want to play that part of the clip.
[02:25:10.355 --> 02:25:15.938]  You can go online, just type Keith Oberman sacrifice into Google and it's up on InfoWars and Prison Planet.
[02:25:15.938 --> 02:25:17.979]  It was up there last week.
[02:25:17.979 --> 02:25:20.400]  But I mean it really boils it all down.
[02:25:20.400 --> 02:25:22.001]  This is human sacrifice.
[02:25:22.001 --> 02:25:28.224]  The next clip I want to play cuts in, this is in the middle of a rant
[02:25:29.603 --> 02:25:57.237]  Of the two-part series we just put up for PrisonPlanet.tv members, and this cuts into me talking about staged wars between cousins in France and England, where I'm there in London, England beneath a big war memorial, and talking about sacrifice and how it's human sacrifice, and the goddess looks down on the big war memorial for 44,000 dead artillery troops in World War I, and it says, the sacrifice, the brotherhood of death.
[02:25:59.156 --> 02:26:08.163]  And then, all over London, anywhere you see a goddess, you'll be driving and see a big goddess, you'll go, I know there'll be a memorial right beneath her she's looking at.
[02:26:08.163 --> 02:26:11.465]  And it's the same thing in Canada, same thing in the U.S.
[02:26:11.465 --> 02:26:13.547]  It is religious.
[02:26:13.547 --> 02:26:20.672]  And they believe, and it'll even say, Order of Death, or the Glorious Death, it'll say a variant of that beneath them.
[02:26:20.672 --> 02:26:25.335]  Well, here's the audio.
[02:26:25.335 --> 02:26:26.076]  Do you have that clip?
[02:26:27.182 --> 02:26:33.206]  John, from when I was out there, are you feeding that to me?
[02:26:33.206 --> 02:26:34.587]  I just can't hear it.
[02:26:34.587 --> 02:26:35.027]  Okay, here it is.
[02:26:35.967 --> 02:26:36.808]  It's like all cousins.
[02:26:36.808 --> 02:26:37.988]  It's time for a war.
[02:26:37.988 --> 02:26:40.010]  I've got some rivals causing a problem.
[02:26:40.010 --> 02:26:42.451]  I'm going to deal with them immediately.
[02:26:42.451 --> 02:26:46.194]  Yes, that's a whip of a wall in for you there.
[02:26:46.194 --> 02:26:49.396]  Last time I took some of your areas.
[02:26:49.396 --> 02:26:50.576]  I'll be taking Brittany back.
[02:26:50.576 --> 02:26:51.557]  Well, there we are.
[02:26:51.557 --> 02:26:53.098]  We've had it for 25 years.
[02:26:53.098 --> 02:26:55.059]  It's your turn now.
[02:26:55.059 --> 02:26:56.200]  Well done then.
[02:26:56.200 --> 02:26:57.461]  This is how it works.
[02:26:57.461 --> 02:26:58.261]  And all of their
[02:27:00.134 --> 02:27:02.755]  Occultism there with the goddess.
[02:27:02.755 --> 02:27:05.135]  She's staring down on her sacrifice.
[02:27:05.135 --> 02:27:14.117]  46,000 dead just from the artillery corps in World War I. And look, a royal fellowship.
[02:27:14.117 --> 02:27:17.218]  And over here, of death.
[02:27:17.218 --> 02:27:20.679]  A royal fellowship of death.
[02:27:20.679 --> 02:27:23.299]  And she stares down all over the western world.
[02:27:23.299 --> 02:27:25.980]  You will see the goddess staring down on memorials.
[02:27:27.452 --> 02:27:30.433]  That are literally built to her as sacrifices.
[02:27:30.433 --> 02:27:32.935]  And right here, skull and bones.
[02:27:32.935 --> 02:27:33.975]  Order of Death.
[02:27:33.975 --> 02:27:34.876]  Order of the Deathshead.
[02:27:34.876 --> 02:27:36.296]  The Nazis.
[02:27:36.296 --> 02:27:39.198]  The Royal Fellowship of Death.
[02:27:39.198 --> 02:27:41.679]  And everywhere, the glorious dead.
[02:27:41.679 --> 02:27:43.520]  The glorious slaughter.
[02:27:43.520 --> 02:27:45.341]  The glorious bloodletting.
[02:27:45.341 --> 02:27:50.563]  That the Goddess demands.
[02:27:50.563 --> 02:27:54.305]  See, here's the Illuminati language hidden in plain view right in your face.
[02:27:59.218 --> 02:28:01.660]  Look at this statue of Achilles.
[02:28:01.660 --> 02:28:08.024]  Just more of the open, mystery-religion occultism of the City of London.
[02:28:08.024 --> 02:28:15.810]  Another war memorial, this time cast according to a Greek hero, or Greek demigod.
[02:28:21.488 --> 02:28:25.772]  Well, this is a Commonwealth nation, still part of the United Kingdom, really.
[02:28:25.772 --> 02:28:28.094]  And we've got this World War I, World War II memorial.
[02:28:28.094 --> 02:28:30.496]  It's very beautiful, but it's also very occultic.
[02:28:30.496 --> 02:28:45.529]  And just as it is in London, and all over the world where you have Commonwealth nations, you've got the goddess, actually two goddesses, with the torch up there and then the wreath of victory, over the victorious soldiers marching through a triumphant arch.
[02:28:45.529 --> 02:28:47.591]  Every facet of this is occultic.
[02:28:55.410 --> 02:28:58.533]  There is massive symbolism here.
[02:28:58.533 --> 02:29:01.655]  You have a star.
[02:29:01.655 --> 02:29:12.404]  You have two twin fillers with obelisk points pointing downwards to the east.
[02:29:12.404 --> 02:29:16.748]  This entire thing is just
[02:29:17.834 --> 02:29:19.775]  Unbelievably occult.
[02:29:19.775 --> 02:29:21.837]  Every facet of the layout.
[02:29:21.837 --> 02:29:34.506]  Again, most people who walk past this have no idea what they're even looking at.
[02:29:34.506 --> 02:29:36.727]  See, people call Texas the Lone Star.
[02:29:36.727 --> 02:29:38.489]  Not going to hell, but Texas is the Lone Star State.
[02:29:38.489 --> 02:29:39.629]  That's the capital.
[02:29:39.629 --> 02:29:46.054]  Which, I got the Russian media with me and I'm going, yes, this is a temple to Diana.
[02:29:48.735 --> 02:29:54.397]  And of course she has several names, and I'm going through all that with her, and she's like, oh no it's not.
[02:29:54.397 --> 02:30:02.160]  We walk in, there's a big plaque saying, this is a temple to the goddess.
[02:30:02.160 --> 02:30:06.361]  Right outside the Capitol, the Russian media's going, huh?
[02:30:06.361 --> 02:30:06.821]  What?
[02:30:06.821 --> 02:30:10.122]  I'm like, yeah, you just thought you were interviewing some kook.
[02:30:10.122 --> 02:30:15.644]  It's a hidden, I mean they got a plaque saying it's a Masonic temple to the goddess.
[02:30:15.644 --> 02:30:18.025]  She's up there holding a pentagram in her hand on top of the Capitol.
[02:30:20.389 --> 02:30:24.300]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[02:30:24.300 --> 02:30:27.008]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:29.986 --> 02:30:34.251]  People who use Cardivite know about the pollutants in our body and want them out.
[02:30:34.251 --> 02:30:37.835]  For over five years, Cardivite has proven itself time-tested.
[02:30:37.835 --> 02:30:41.559]  Here's Dr. Matson, a naturopathic doctor's thoughts on Cardivite.
[02:30:41.559 --> 02:30:44.843]  In our mind, there isn't such a great big mystery to disease anymore.
[02:30:44.843 --> 02:30:50.229]  This basic tenet of yeast in the gut and metals in the liver covers at least 70-80% of the diseases that we see.
[02:30:50.469 --> 02:30:50.849]  We're good to go.
[02:31:07.270 --> 02:31:13.412]  If you'll find I think that it'll work more than just on heart problems and circulation problems, it'll work on other problems as well.

[02:32:31.471 --> 02:32:35.833]  Hi, I'm Joyce Riley and many of you know that for years I was a cardiovascular heart transplant nurse.
[02:32:35.833 --> 02:32:39.194]  Since that time I've educated myself on the importance of preventative care.
[02:32:39.194 --> 02:32:43.496]  It all begins with providing your heart and vascular system with building blocks for good health.
[02:32:43.496 --> 02:32:47.518]  Strauss Heart Drops is the original formula that was copied by others but never duplicated.
[02:32:48.158 --> 02:32:53.745]  Strauss Heart Drops were developed by a master herbalist, Jim Strauss, after he suffered a heart attack in 1979.
[02:32:53.745 --> 02:32:56.949]  His doctor said he would only survive if he had heart bypass surgery.
[02:32:56.949 --> 02:32:58.190]  And Jim said no.
[02:32:58.190 --> 02:33:02.915]  He developed Strauss Heart Drops, the formula that has been copied by others, but never been surpassed.
[02:33:02.915 --> 02:33:05.438]  Get the original Strauss Heart Drops, 4-ounce bottle, for only $79.99.

[02:33:11.585 --> 02:33:17.170]  You've probably heard about the other products that have tried to copy the Strauss formula?
[02:33:17.170 --> 02:33:19.412]  Well, get the original Strauss Heart Drops by calling 877-817-9829.
[02:33:19.412 --> 02:33:19.713]  That's 877-817-9829.
[02:33:19.713 --> 02:33:22.456]  Now you can really do your heart right with Strauss Heart Drops.
[02:33:30.862 --> 02:33:34.123]  Thrashing through the lies and disinformation.
[02:33:34.123 --> 02:33:39.826]  It's Alex Jones, only on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:33:39.826 --> 02:33:53.632]  Federal law went into effect that you have to have an internal passport in the nation, and you also have to have, not just a passport, but the federal government has to decide if you can enter or leave, even if you're a U.S.
[02:33:53.632 --> 02:33:54.032]  citizen.
[02:33:56.329 --> 02:33:58.571]  This has never before happened in the U.S.
[02:33:58.571 --> 02:34:01.593]  The Soviet Union and only a few other countries had laws like this.
[02:34:01.593 --> 02:34:12.301]  I mean, obviously, if there's an APB out, or you're fleeing the law, obviously they swipe your passport, they grab you because there's a, you know, if they're going to arrest you or detain you, they've got to have a reason.
[02:34:12.301 --> 02:34:13.281]  No, no, no, no.
[02:34:13.281 --> 02:34:15.223]  You think no-fly lists are bad?
[02:34:15.223 --> 02:34:19.626]  This is so you can't leave without swiping that passport and they can stop you.
[02:34:19.626 --> 02:34:20.967]  So, we'll get into that.
[02:34:20.967 --> 02:34:21.267]  U.S.
[02:34:21.267 --> 02:34:25.070]  warns Iran to back down with carrier task force group threatening to attack.
[02:34:26.607 --> 02:34:28.168]  That's out of the Associated Press.
[02:34:28.168 --> 02:34:30.129]  This is getting really serious.
[02:34:30.129 --> 02:34:32.090]  And they don't care if the people don't want it.
[02:34:32.090 --> 02:34:33.190]  They don't care if it's a fraud.
[02:34:33.190 --> 02:34:35.351]  They'll probably go ahead and just attack them.
[02:34:35.351 --> 02:34:44.356]  We're getting very, very close to all of this just boiling over.
[02:34:44.356 --> 02:34:49.358]  Also in Africa, Reuters reports South Africa urged to isolate killer TB patients.
[02:34:49.358 --> 02:34:50.278]  Hey, do like the U.S.
[02:34:50.278 --> 02:34:50.518]  does.
[02:34:50.518 --> 02:34:53.600]  We have killer TB and drug-resistant, drug-immune everywhere.
[02:34:54.688 --> 02:35:12.341]  Man, they just put the kids with it right next to the other kids in the classes and nothing happens, but then they push all sorts of bizarre deadly mercury filled vaccines on the kids and try to make girls take stuff for cancer, cancer vaccines for cervical cancer caused by a virus.
[02:35:12.341 --> 02:35:13.622]  It's just so crazy.
[02:35:15.037 --> 02:35:15.577]  Get into that.
[02:35:15.577 --> 02:35:19.280]  Also, House may attach Section 220 to its lobbying ethics bill.
[02:35:19.280 --> 02:35:26.944]  That's the one that will make anybody who has a blog or a website or a posting site with over 500 visitors a year register as a lobbyist and be under federal law.
[02:35:26.944 --> 02:35:29.466]  No free speech, basically.
[02:35:29.466 --> 02:35:32.067]  Millions could see taxes up in Bush's new health plan.
[02:35:32.067 --> 02:35:34.349]  I'm going to mention all of this.
[02:35:34.349 --> 02:35:37.951]  An 81-year-old Pennsylvania man got a visit from the Secret Service for saying something
[02:35:39.231 --> 02:35:41.312]  Vaguely mean towards the President.
[02:35:41.312 --> 02:35:43.212]  Black Caucus says no whites allowed.
[02:35:43.212 --> 02:35:47.734]  I guess that's why it's the Black Caucus.
[02:35:47.734 --> 02:35:49.174]  United States and the U.N.
[02:35:49.174 --> 02:35:51.315]  drafts Holocaust Denial Resolution.
[02:35:51.315 --> 02:35:56.296]  And again, folks, it's about free speech.
[02:35:56.296 --> 02:36:01.098]  You can say 10 billion people died or millions died, and we know Hitler killed a lot of people.
[02:36:01.098 --> 02:36:04.479]  The point is, if somebody wants to say he was a nice person, that's their right to do it.
[02:36:07.006 --> 02:36:12.027]  So we'll break that down as well, because folks, they're not really wanting to take the Nazis' free speech.
[02:36:12.027 --> 02:36:13.568]  They're wanting to take our free speech.
[02:36:13.568 --> 02:36:17.089]  They're wanting to take people who are against the war's free speech.
[02:36:17.089 --> 02:36:20.110]  Either everybody's got free speech, or none of us have it.
[02:36:20.110 --> 02:36:26.992]  Marty Schachter, Schachten, hadn't been on with us in a few weeks, and I just love him to death, and I wanted to get him back up.
[02:36:26.992 --> 02:36:29.952]  He's got the five-star soap.
[02:36:29.952 --> 02:36:35.234]  It was organic back before they even had to call it organic, but he's certified by the state of California.
[02:36:36.426 --> 02:36:40.930]  It's no animal products, no tallow.
[02:36:40.930 --> 02:36:46.075]  It's just vegetable and fruit oils and extracts, and it's what we use in my home.
[02:36:46.075 --> 02:36:48.177]  It's what my staff uses.
[02:36:48.177 --> 02:36:50.979]  Listeners have gotten the little sampler pack.
[02:36:50.979 --> 02:36:52.861]  What is it, like 17 bucks?
[02:36:52.861 --> 02:36:57.145]  It's got a sample of everything they make, where you can get a six-month year supply, two-year supply.
[02:36:57.145 --> 02:37:00.508]  You'll save 85% off supermarket prices.
[02:37:01.500 --> 02:37:07.844]  And with their monopoly going, the oligopoly going, the cartel going with the big chemical companies, they make your soap chemicals.
[02:37:07.844 --> 02:37:08.564]  It's not really soap.
[02:37:08.564 --> 02:37:10.205]  It's not soap for your clothes.
[02:37:10.205 --> 02:37:13.066]  It's detergents that eat them.
[02:37:13.066 --> 02:37:16.348]  And because you get it direct from the manufacturer, three generations.
[02:37:16.348 --> 02:37:17.509]  Marty's father started it.
[02:37:17.509 --> 02:37:19.390]  His son now works with him.
[02:37:19.390 --> 02:37:23.172]  And they've been around for, what is it, 60 years?
[02:37:23.172 --> 02:37:25.953]  Since 1947.
[02:37:25.953 --> 02:37:27.854]  And they're out in Oakland, California.
[02:37:27.854 --> 02:37:28.855]  And folks,
[02:37:29.853 --> 02:37:45.818]  Bath Soap, Hair Soap, Dishwasher Soap, Clothes Washing Soap, Creams, Lotions, Bar Soap is the best with that Cherry Oil, or Almond Oil, just smells so good.
[02:37:45.818 --> 02:37:50.460]  And again, you leave Chemical Soap, Detergent under your arms, you get burned with just a drop or two.
[02:37:50.460 --> 02:37:53.241]  This stuff, you leave a little bit on you by accident, nothing happens.
[02:37:53.937 --> 02:37:55.538]  Because it's soap.
[02:37:55.538 --> 02:37:56.960]  Marty, good to talk to you, my friend.
[02:37:56.960 --> 02:37:58.461]  Pleasure talking to you.
[02:37:58.461 --> 02:38:01.043]  We're on Homeland Cleanliness.
[02:38:01.043 --> 02:38:01.643]  That's right.
[02:38:01.643 --> 02:38:04.806]  We all need to be clean in the new Homeland system.
[02:38:04.806 --> 02:38:12.132]  Tell folks why your soap is so good and why they need to call and get a free catalog or call and get the sampler pack or call and get a year's supply.
[02:38:12.717 --> 02:38:31.945]  Well, most of the people in our country, and this really aggravates me, have been hypnotized, brainwashed, uh, and controlled about the chemicals they're buying from the supermarket by the major billion-dollar corporations like Procter, Lever, and Colgate, and we counter that.
[02:38:31.945 --> 02:38:42.249]  We go direct to the home from our factory with pure soap products, not detergents, not caustic, not stuff that burns, harms, pollutes,
[02:38:42.765 --> 02:38:43.605]  We don't go for that.
[02:38:43.605 --> 02:38:44.345]  We don't need that.
[02:38:44.345 --> 02:38:49.346]  Perfumes, so-called fragrances, are very toxic.
[02:38:49.346 --> 02:38:53.047]  And it's a constant war with the chemical companies.
[02:38:53.047 --> 02:38:55.207]  Who's got the newest smell?
[02:38:55.207 --> 02:38:56.447]  The newest fragrance?
[02:38:56.447 --> 02:38:58.108]  The newest perfume?
[02:38:58.108 --> 02:38:59.648]  Well, those are all harmful.
[02:38:59.648 --> 02:39:00.548]  We don't use that.
[02:39:00.548 --> 02:39:10.250]  We use natural juices from almonds, from cherries, from lemons, from all these things that are harmless.
[02:39:10.615 --> 02:39:15.397]  Give a nice smell, but don't hurt, harm, or burn, or pollute.
[02:39:15.397 --> 02:39:25.823]  This is the difference between buying all natural, pure soaps from us, factory direct, save money, save the environment, save your skin.
[02:39:25.823 --> 02:39:26.743]  We make it.
[02:39:26.743 --> 02:39:39.490]  We've been doing it now, and this is the 60th year right now that my family, and we are a family owned and operated company, products are American, made right here,
[02:39:40.029 --> 02:39:49.058]  And we sell to Americans, and we want happiness in the home, once again, with cleanliness, which is better than anything.
[02:39:49.058 --> 02:39:51.400]  We gotta deprogram the people.
[02:39:51.400 --> 02:39:52.942]  And that's what you're doing, Alex.
[02:39:52.942 --> 02:39:58.968]  You're deprogramming them from the chemicals to pure soap, and we appreciate that very much.
[02:39:58.968 --> 02:40:00.789]  Well, you also save 85% off supermarket prices.
[02:40:03.217 --> 02:40:09.882]  By getting it directly from the factory, the family-owned factory there in Oakland, California, and I just love bringing my listeners a good deal.
[02:40:09.882 --> 02:40:15.847]  We don't push magic creams or magic machines or any of the quack stuff here.
[02:40:15.847 --> 02:40:25.175]  I'm endorsing this because I just fell into discovering it because you happened to send me some samples, a whole year of it when you were sponsoring just on Genesis.
[02:40:25.815 --> 02:40:28.056]  People know the story.
[02:40:28.056 --> 02:40:29.497]  My wife's like, what is this stuff?
[02:40:29.497 --> 02:40:33.038]  And it really is amazing and it's very inexpensive.
[02:40:33.038 --> 02:40:38.561]  So I want my listeners to save money and support the show and support you, an American company.
[02:40:38.561 --> 02:40:43.243]  I know it's unheard of, but a family owned company and it's totally organic.
[02:40:43.243 --> 02:40:45.904]  Marty, give them your phone number and give them your website.
[02:40:45.904 --> 02:40:52.007]  Our website is 5, it could be the letter, it could be the number, 5starsoap.com.
[02:40:52.623 --> 02:41:01.533]  FiveStarSoap.com, the letter or the number, and you can simply go there and order, or you can call toll-free.
[02:41:01.533 --> 02:41:02.394]  Give them that website.
[02:41:02.394 --> 02:41:02.535]  800-340-7091.
[02:41:02.535 --> 02:41:02.735]  That's 800-340-7091.
[02:41:13.072 --> 02:41:15.393]  Doesn't cost you a penny to call.
[02:41:15.393 --> 02:41:16.814]  Like a free catalog.
[02:41:16.814 --> 02:41:18.134]  You can get there right away.
[02:41:18.134 --> 02:41:20.576]  And this is a big, giant color catalog.
[02:41:20.576 --> 02:41:23.237]  I've got the 5 Star Gazer.
[02:41:23.237 --> 02:41:24.357]  That's the one you send out?
[02:41:24.357 --> 02:41:24.798]  Right.
[02:41:24.798 --> 02:41:27.479]  Everyone gets a 5 Star Gazer with an order.
[02:41:27.479 --> 02:41:30.740]  And we get a full catalog of all the details.
[02:41:30.740 --> 02:41:31.881]  All the pure silks.
[02:41:31.881 --> 02:41:33.982]  We're only talking 4 products here.
[02:41:33.982 --> 02:41:38.104]  Bath Soap, Air Soap, Dish Soap, and Laundry Soap.
[02:41:38.104 --> 02:41:40.805]  And this is what we put into our mini sampler.
[02:41:40.805 --> 02:41:42.306]  Which weighs out at 6 pounds.
[02:41:42.916 --> 02:41:44.316]  Generous supply.
[02:41:44.316 --> 02:41:45.056]  Here's the thing.
[02:41:45.056 --> 02:41:47.917]  I mean, over the years, I'd buy skin cream when it gets real dry in the winter.
[02:41:47.917 --> 02:41:50.778]  I don't really put cream on most of the year, but my skin starts cracking.
[02:41:50.778 --> 02:41:52.778]  You know, it happens to everybody.
[02:41:52.778 --> 02:41:56.679]  And in the past, you know, I'd buy stuff at the store and it would, like, burn on my skin.
[02:41:56.679 --> 02:41:58.139]  Your skin cream doesn't burn.
[02:41:58.139 --> 02:42:05.961]  No, because it's coconut oil, pure pharmaceutical grade cocoa butter that we use in our products.
[02:42:06.408 --> 02:42:10.530]  And it really replaces all that junk at the cosmetic counter.
[02:42:10.530 --> 02:42:14.212]  All those chemicals from those billion-dollar corporations.
[02:42:14.212 --> 02:42:15.812]  Don't need it anymore!
[02:42:15.812 --> 02:42:17.133]  Marty, give the web... Wake up!
[02:42:17.133 --> 02:42:17.673]  Wake up!
[02:42:17.673 --> 02:42:19.794]  Wake up your soap call!
[02:42:19.794 --> 02:42:23.376]  Give the number out and, uh, give the webshot out.
[02:42:23.376 --> 02:42:26.857]  Website is 5starsoap.com.
[02:42:26.857 --> 02:42:27.438]  Simple.
[02:42:27.438 --> 02:42:28.338]  Easy.
[02:42:28.338 --> 02:42:29.078]  A phone number.
[02:42:29.078 --> 02:42:29.178]  Free.
[02:42:29.178 --> 02:42:29.218]  800-340-7091.
[02:42:35.177 --> 02:42:36.057]  I'm here every day.
[02:42:36.057 --> 02:42:39.238]  You can speak to me about any cleaning problems you've got.
[02:42:39.238 --> 02:42:41.018]  I'll be happy to take care of you.
[02:42:41.018 --> 02:42:46.519]  We look forward to you joining our family of soaps for cleanliness.
[02:42:46.519 --> 02:42:51.780]  I've just got to take you out of coach and put you into first class.
[02:42:51.780 --> 02:42:53.621]  And at 85% off, folks.
[02:42:53.621 --> 02:42:54.301]  It's not hype.
[02:42:54.301 --> 02:42:54.781]  Check it out.
[02:42:54.781 --> 02:42:57.922]  Get the free catalog or buy the $17 sampler pack.
[02:42:57.922 --> 02:42:58.242]  Do it.
[02:42:58.242 --> 02:43:03.723]  You'll be happy and you'll save money and support a good patriotic, American-owned, family-owned company.
[02:43:03.723 --> 02:43:04.883]  The number one more time, Marty.
[02:43:05.572 --> 02:43:05.732]  800-340-7091.
[02:43:05.732 --> 02:43:12.456]  Get a free catalog.
[02:43:12.456 --> 02:43:15.597]  Get a free sampler for $16.
[02:43:15.597 --> 02:43:16.838]  It's all there.
[02:43:16.838 --> 02:43:18.759]  Guaranteed.
[02:43:18.759 --> 02:43:19.199]  100%.
[02:43:19.199 --> 02:43:20.880]  Okay, Marty, we'll talk to you soon.
[02:43:20.880 --> 02:43:24.022]  Give us your limerick.
[02:43:24.022 --> 02:43:26.423]  This is from 1870.
[02:43:26.423 --> 02:43:29.144]  Attributed to Abraham Lincoln.
[02:43:29.144 --> 02:43:32.366]  I'm not sure if it's so, but some say it is attributed.
[02:43:32.366 --> 02:43:33.566]  It goes like this.
[02:43:33.566 --> 02:43:34.467]  Drinking beer
[02:43:35.066 --> 02:43:38.769]  From a tomato can will never kill a man.
[02:43:38.769 --> 02:43:44.274]  Drinking beer won't kill a man, but an old tomato can.
[02:43:44.274 --> 02:43:45.274]  Take care, Marty.
[02:43:45.274 --> 02:43:46.535]  Thank you, Alex.
[02:43:46.535 --> 02:43:46.896]  You bet.
[02:43:46.896 --> 02:43:47.856]  What a character, folks.
[02:43:47.856 --> 02:43:49.077]  5starsub.com.
[02:43:49.077 --> 02:43:50.919]  We've got a big banner up on InfoWars.com.
[02:43:50.919 --> 02:43:54.922]  All right, let me run through the news here.
[02:43:54.922 --> 02:43:55.282]  U.S.
[02:43:55.282 --> 02:43:58.265]  warns Iran to back down, Associated Press.
[02:43:58.265 --> 02:43:59.226]  The second U.S.
[02:43:59.226 --> 02:44:00.987]  aircraft carrier strike group.
[02:44:00.987 --> 02:44:01.948]  There's four of them.
[02:44:02.808 --> 02:44:07.431]  The Foreign Press reports four, but it's those many carriers, so I guess it doesn't count.
[02:44:07.431 --> 02:44:11.554]  There's four task forces, okay, but two of the supercarriers.
[02:44:33.493 --> 02:44:38.655]  Between Washington and Tehran was not possible until Iran halts uranium enrichment.
[02:44:38.655 --> 02:44:42.396]  The Middle East isn't a region to be dominated by Iran.
[02:44:42.396 --> 02:44:45.457]  The Gulf isn't a body of water to be controlled by Iran.
[02:44:45.457 --> 02:44:49.999]  That's why we've seen United States Station 2 aircraft carrier battle groups in the region.
[02:44:49.999 --> 02:44:53.480]  Burns sent an address to the Dubai-based Gulf Region Center.
[02:44:54.790 --> 02:45:11.994]  And the BBC and the Korean Times reported on Sunday that there is a massive strike on hundreds of sites, and on their Navy, and on their missile forces, and their conventional forces, and even a possible invasion into the West, where most of their oil just so happens to be in that couple hundred mile swath.
[02:45:11.994 --> 02:45:18.276]  They're along the eastern border of Iraq, western border of Iran, bordering each other.
[02:45:19.941 --> 02:45:26.583]  Continuing here, millions could see taxes up in Bush's health plan.
[02:45:26.583 --> 02:45:32.384]  And what is Bush doing to give people universal health care, which is what the big banks want, to control all of us?
[02:45:32.384 --> 02:45:35.625]  It sounds great to give everybody health care.
[02:45:35.625 --> 02:45:39.446]  But it gives them control of health care.
[02:45:39.446 --> 02:45:42.347]  It socializes it.
[02:45:42.347 --> 02:45:46.728]  About 30 million Americans could face a tax hike under President George W. Bush's plan
[02:45:47.734 --> 02:45:52.718]  And I looked at Watchdog Ribs, they're saying more like 50 million Americans.
[02:45:52.718 --> 02:46:01.924]  And it says here that they plan to tax, later they admit, 47 million people.
[02:46:01.924 --> 02:46:05.667]  They want to give health insurance by taxing 50 million people.
[02:46:05.667 --> 02:46:12.952]  And it says that they're going to tax our insurance premiums.
[02:46:12.952 --> 02:46:15.293]  And it says here that
[02:46:17.933 --> 02:46:34.877]  Anyone who has employer-provided plans, and that's me, I'm one of the few talk shows that's actually an employee of Genesis and I've had, I guess for six years, health insurance with them.
[02:46:34.877 --> 02:46:39.439]  Oh, there'll be a tax, it says a hefty one, of $15,000
[02:46:46.067 --> 02:47:06.310]  for an average size family's insurance so the president's proposing this is incredible so they're talking about taxing some people's insurance policies and then giving tax deductions
[02:47:07.922 --> 02:47:10.404]  for families to get insurance.
[02:47:10.404 --> 02:47:12.045]  So you've got to love that.
[02:47:12.045 --> 02:47:13.987]  Talk about a deal for the insurance companies.
[02:47:13.987 --> 02:47:22.873]  Bush is going to take one group's money and give it to another group to then buy insurance from the same insurance companies.
[02:47:22.873 --> 02:47:25.635]  That is just incredible.
[02:47:25.635 --> 02:47:27.017]  I'm babbling through this a bit.
[02:47:27.017 --> 02:47:30.919]  Sometimes we don't print these in printer friendly and it cut off the last two words of each line.
[02:47:30.919 --> 02:47:32.661]  I'm trying to decipher this.
[02:47:32.661 --> 02:47:35.503]  Again, Bush is proposing to make
[02:47:36.503 --> 02:47:57.639]  Health insurance premiums, taxable income, with people who have employer program plans, a tax hike, and it says he's going to talk about this in the State of the Union tonight, so I guess we'll hear it directly from the horse's mouth.
[02:47:57.639 --> 02:48:03.083]  Oh, going back to that Keith Olbermann thing where he's... There's a problem with Keith Olbermann, though.
[02:48:03.832 --> 02:48:05.754]  He's implying that Bush is listening to no one.
[02:48:05.754 --> 02:48:06.934]  Bush is an idiot.
[02:48:06.934 --> 02:48:08.936]  Bush is running everything.
[02:48:08.936 --> 02:48:10.497]  The policy doesn't make sense.
[02:48:10.497 --> 02:48:12.158]  Oh my gosh, it's Bush, it's Bush.
[02:48:12.158 --> 02:48:13.139]  Bush runs nothing.
[02:48:13.139 --> 02:48:25.368]  James Baker and Henry Kissinger and those guys are the Rockefeller Rothschild agents that the Roman Emperors had that individual, their legates, that could go around acting as the Emperor in his voice.
[02:48:25.368 --> 02:48:25.809]  Well, that's who
[02:48:27.338 --> 02:48:29.099]  People like Brzezinski.
[02:48:29.099 --> 02:48:32.221]  He's definitely a legate of the New World Order.
[02:48:32.221 --> 02:48:38.044]  James Baker, George Shultz, no doubt Henry Kissinger, are legates.
[02:48:38.044 --> 02:48:41.005]  And they go around, they chair almost every commission.
[02:48:41.005 --> 02:48:44.987]  I was down in Galveston on vacation at the beach.
[02:48:44.987 --> 02:48:52.911]  Picked up a local Galveston paper and it was James Baker III chairs a look at the BP chemical plant explosion that killed a bunch of people.
[02:48:53.895 --> 02:48:57.397]  And he went on to basically, he was whitewashing the whole thing.
[02:48:57.397 --> 02:49:02.919]  It's just like every commission there is, it seems one of these creatures is on it whitewashing.
[02:49:02.919 --> 02:49:06.901]  He's gotten tough on them and you read it and he did nothing to them.
[02:49:06.901 --> 02:49:07.982]  I mean, it just never ends.
[02:49:07.982 --> 02:49:10.483]  By the way, did you ever find that part in the 10 Minute Club of Overman?
[02:49:11.819 --> 02:49:16.882]  Yeah, here's the part where he talks specifically about how Bush is engaging in human sacrifice.
[02:49:16.882 --> 02:49:22.266]  See, still though, the illusion that Bush is running something or that Barack Obama or Hillary will run something.
[02:49:22.266 --> 02:49:23.607]  They're total puppets.
[02:49:23.607 --> 02:49:25.087]  Here it is.
[02:49:25.087 --> 02:49:26.628]  No, sir, this is not sacrifice.
[02:49:26.628 --> 02:49:29.490]  This has now become human sacrifice.
[02:49:29.490 --> 02:49:30.811]  And it must stop.
[02:49:30.811 --> 02:49:32.612]  And you can stop it.
[02:49:32.612 --> 02:49:33.453]  Next week.
[02:49:33.453 --> 02:49:35.474]  Make us all look wrong.
[02:49:36.249 --> 02:49:42.973]  Our meaningless sacrifice in Iraq must stop, and you, sir, must stop it.
[02:49:42.973 --> 02:49:44.454]  From Washington, I'm Keith Olderman.
[02:49:44.454 --> 02:49:47.295]  Good night and good luck.
[02:49:47.295 --> 02:49:52.718]  As I've been saying for years, it's human sacrifice, as Hutton Gibson said last hour, as Mel Gibson has said.
[02:49:52.718 --> 02:49:55.900]  I mean, anybody who's got half a brain knows this.
[02:49:55.900 --> 02:50:00.162]  House may attach Section 220 to its lobbying ethics bills, from Ted Pike,
[02:50:01.691 --> 02:50:05.853]  Section 220 that was introduced and had passed out of committee was shot down late last week.
[02:50:05.853 --> 02:50:08.273]  It would make all bloggers registered.
[02:50:08.273 --> 02:50:11.614]  By all, I mean almost everybody's getting 500 visitors a year, folks.
[02:50:11.614 --> 02:50:16.036]  I mean, the smallest MySpace with 15 friends is getting that in a month.
[02:50:16.036 --> 02:50:18.196]  Much less a year.
[02:50:18.196 --> 02:50:21.897]  I mean, go look at little bitty MySpace accounts with just a few members and they're a few months old.
[02:50:21.897 --> 02:50:23.018]  It'll say, you know, 700 page views.
[02:50:23.018 --> 02:50:25.178]  That's pretty much 500 visitors right there.
[02:50:28.833 --> 02:50:32.596]  And be under all these laws and have to report and be restricted on what you can say or do?
[02:50:32.596 --> 02:50:34.738]  I mean, that's not America.
[02:50:34.738 --> 02:50:43.724]  Well, last week the massive calling by the religious and political right made the difference in stripping freedom-threatening legislation from the Senate's Lobbying Reform Bill, S.
[02:50:43.724 --> 02:50:46.466]  1, Section 220.
[02:50:46.466 --> 02:50:51.850]  But now they are tacking it on to the Hate Crimes Law.
[02:50:54.306 --> 02:50:58.370]  And they're talking about then reattaching it to another lobbying bill if they bring it back.
[02:50:58.370 --> 02:51:02.614]  So, they're just coming at us from every conceivable angle.
[02:51:02.614 --> 02:51:05.356]  When we get back, got a passport.
[02:51:05.356 --> 02:51:08.860]  Travel rules tightened today.
[02:51:08.860 --> 02:51:09.460]  January 23rd.
[02:51:09.460 --> 02:51:11.522]  It's supposed to be January 7th, but they're doing it late.
[02:51:11.522 --> 02:51:12.123]  They're behind.
[02:51:12.123 --> 02:51:16.487]  Don't worry though, you'll get your internal passport.
[02:51:18.021 --> 02:51:22.724]  And South Africa urged to isolate killer TB patients, Reuters.
[02:51:22.724 --> 02:51:26.146]  We'll hit these two final stories in the final segment.
[02:51:26.146 --> 02:51:27.006]  Keep it locked in.
[02:51:27.006 --> 02:51:31.068]  PrisonPlanet.com.
[02:51:31.068 --> 02:51:36.771]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands.
[02:51:36.771 --> 02:51:39.073]  My new film, Terror Storm, is complete.
[02:51:39.073 --> 02:51:46.737]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that Western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[02:51:47.412 --> 02:51:54.856]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[02:51:54.856 --> 02:52:06.601]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, the White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[02:52:06.601 --> 02:52:10.563]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[02:52:10.563 --> 02:52:12.824]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[02:52:12.824 --> 02:52:16.666]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.
[02:52:24.532 --> 02:52:32.919]  The War on Terrorism.
[02:52:32.919 --> 02:52:35.981]  Will it be fought overseas or will it affect us here at home?
[02:52:35.981 --> 02:52:40.545]  If you are like most folks, you want to be prepared, but can't afford an underground shelter.
[02:52:40.545 --> 02:52:41.706]  So what do you do?
[02:52:41.706 --> 02:52:46.270]  Did you know that you can use your home as a shelter against fallout and biological or chemical attacks?
[02:52:46.730 --> 02:52:49.351]  With a little know-how, it's not that difficult.
[02:52:49.351 --> 02:53:04.095]  Sheltering in Place, Surviving Acts of Terrorism from Biological, Chemical, and Radioactive Fallout, developed by Wayne LeBaron, a health physicist who has served as a specialist in environmental health, communicable diseases, and has worked as a nuclear specialist for the U.S.
[02:53:04.095 --> 02:53:11.137]  government, gives you easy-to-follow video instructions, and walks you step-by-step through the process of preparing your home as a shelter.

[02:54:23.886 --> 02:54:31.869]  HerbalHealer.com Celebrating 18 years of dedication.
[02:54:31.869 --> 02:54:41.592]  Two riders were approaching and the wind began to howl.
[02:54:41.592 --> 02:54:43.053]  A gentleman came and cranked up.
[02:54:48.452 --> 02:54:52.758]  There must be some kind of way out of here.
[02:54:52.758 --> 02:54:57.104]  Said the joker to the thief.
[02:54:57.104 --> 02:55:01.570]  There's too much confusion.
[02:55:01.570 --> 02:55:03.593]  I can't get no relief.
[02:55:04.955 --> 02:55:05.896]  Welcome back!
[02:55:05.896 --> 02:55:14.643]  There are many here among us who think that life is but a joke.
[02:55:14.643 --> 02:55:19.247]  But you and I, we've been through that!
[02:55:19.247 --> 02:55:21.248]  And this is not our fate!
[02:55:34.804 --> 02:55:36.484]  Yeah, let's hear that part on the news.
[02:55:36.484 --> 02:55:38.985]  It says it all.
[02:55:38.985 --> 02:55:41.485]  No reason to get excited.
[02:55:41.485 --> 02:55:47.487]  But please be kindly told.
[02:55:47.487 --> 02:55:54.888]  There are many here among us who feel that life is but a joke.
[02:55:54.888 --> 02:56:00.329]  But you and I, we've been through that.
[02:56:00.329 --> 02:56:02.270]  And this is not our fate.
[02:56:03.130 --> 02:56:07.613]  So let us.
[02:56:07.613 --> 02:56:09.974]  The hour is getting late.
[02:56:09.974 --> 02:56:11.915]  Now stop talking falsely.
[02:56:11.915 --> 02:56:13.616]  Get off the fence.
[02:56:13.616 --> 02:56:15.797]  The fence has gotten mighty rough.
[02:56:15.797 --> 02:56:18.939]  Decide whose side you're on, right now.
[02:56:18.939 --> 02:56:22.381]  I'm telling you right now, everybody out there listening.
[02:56:22.381 --> 02:56:24.722]  Commit to this fight against the New World Order.
[02:56:24.722 --> 02:56:26.503]  Admit we're in deep trouble.
[02:56:26.503 --> 02:56:30.145]  Or just get out of my way and join the enemy.
[02:56:30.145 --> 02:56:30.826]  I demand it.
[02:56:32.728 --> 02:56:34.729]  And you know your soul demands it.
[02:56:34.729 --> 02:56:37.071]  This is the best part of the guitar, right here.
[02:57:04.640 --> 02:57:06.881]  All right, folks.
[02:57:06.881 --> 02:57:10.223]  I'll be back tonight, 9 to midnight, on the internet, on the network.
[02:57:10.223 --> 02:57:15.446]  We re-air at 9 to midnight, but the show re-airs every day for every three hours when the show ends.
[02:57:15.446 --> 02:57:26.553]  And we also have the free podcast, the whole show, when you subscribe to it for free at PrisonPlanet.tv, InfoWars.com.
[02:57:26.553 --> 02:57:29.955]  And by the way, that costs me thousands of dollars a month, so be sure and support us.
[02:57:29.955 --> 02:57:33.317]  Buy some of the videos and books off the website at InfoWars.com.
[02:57:34.523 --> 02:57:35.524]  Got a passport?
[02:57:35.524 --> 02:57:40.367]  Travel rules tightened today!
[02:57:40.367 --> 02:57:41.708]  And we told you about this.
[02:57:41.708 --> 02:57:47.751]  Now understand, they don't have an APB, they don't have charges, they don't have an arrest warrant, they don't have a, you know, we're in hot pursuit.
[02:57:47.751 --> 02:57:51.073]  You know, in the past, you know, the old cop movies, but in the real world, we've done a ride-along.
[02:57:51.073 --> 02:57:51.714]  I've done one before.
[02:57:52.543 --> 02:57:59.308]  When they say, we're looking for a blue pickup with John Doe, and he's a suspect in a bank robbery and a liquor store robbery.
[02:57:59.308 --> 02:58:00.869]  Proceed with extreme caution.
[02:58:00.869 --> 02:58:06.794]  As you know in the go by aliases, there's a tattoo on the right arm and a nose to use revolvers.
[02:58:06.794 --> 02:58:09.856]  If seen, call in immediate backup before proceeding.
[02:58:09.856 --> 02:58:12.878]  They had to have a reason, and that's fine!
[02:58:12.878 --> 02:58:13.879]  Nooooo!
[02:58:15.871 --> 02:58:21.195]  They will just put you into the system, just like a no-flight list, and you can't leave the country without it.
