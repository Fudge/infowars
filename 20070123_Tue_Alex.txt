[00:00.000 --> 00:30.000]  Find out right now.
[00:30.000 --> 00:37.000]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[01:00.000 --> 01:19.720]  Welcome, my friends. Welcome. Thank you so much for joining us as we start another three
[01:19.720 --> 01:27.440]  hour transmission against tyranny. It is Tuesday, the 23rd day of January, 2007. We're going
[01:27.440 --> 01:32.200]  to have open phones today and take a lot of your phone calls and cover the news. We
[01:32.200 --> 01:37.720]  have Hutton Gibson, who hasn't done a talk radio interview in over two and a half years
[01:37.720 --> 01:44.400]  since the big Passion of the Christ controversy. He's coming on today, though, to talk about
[01:44.400 --> 01:51.080]  the Catholic Church and how it's been taken over by Masonic influences and what Rat Singer
[01:51.080 --> 01:56.360]  is doing when he calls for a new world order, when he went to Turkey and prayed to Mecca
[01:56.360 --> 02:06.320]  and much, much more with Hutton Gibson joining us in the second hour. I am honored that Mr.
[02:06.320 --> 02:16.400]  Gibson and the Gibson family trust this show enough that he would break his silence on
[02:16.400 --> 02:29.720]  this broadcast. I was very pleased when I was contacted and told a few weeks ago, and
[02:29.720 --> 02:35.780]  I talked to Hutton, that he was considering speaking out despite the media demonization
[02:35.780 --> 02:39.880]  and other things that he went through and the taking out of context statements that
[02:39.880 --> 02:44.440]  he'd made and people making up statements that he never had made. But again, he'll be
[02:44.440 --> 02:49.760]  joining us to talk about the Catholic Church, what the traditional Catholics are really
[02:49.760 --> 02:59.040]  saying that is coming up in the second hour today. In the meantime, I don't know where
[02:59.040 --> 03:05.720]  to start with all this news. Paul Watson wrote an article yesterday about Mexican street
[03:05.720 --> 03:13.320]  gangs targeting blacks. And we have a message board, and I'd say about 30% of people in
[03:13.360 --> 03:19.560]  there were very mad at us, claiming that we were trying to be racist against Hispanics
[03:19.560 --> 03:28.560]  by simply reporting this. Folks, we're just trying to cover the news here. And the facts
[03:28.560 --> 03:36.920]  are the facts. It is a minority of Hispanics, but it is a large group of people who say
[03:36.920 --> 03:44.040]  they want to kill all whites and all blacks. And the head of the University of Texas-Chicano
[03:44.040 --> 03:49.800]  studies at UT Arlington has given speeches, we've played clips of him in the past, he
[03:49.800 --> 03:56.260]  said all white males, 16 and older, need to be killed. Now he just says all whites need
[03:56.260 --> 04:05.700]  to be killed and it's been in the news. I have to report on this. Frankly, I'm a modern
[04:05.700 --> 04:13.040]  white male riddled with guilt, over what whites have done in the past, but I've broken
[04:13.040 --> 04:20.820]  through that and I stand up against any and all forms of tribalism and racism that go
[04:20.820 --> 04:31.540]  on out there and I just don't understand the incredible denial that some people are engaging
[04:31.540 --> 04:38.000]  in when it comes to this subject. And the globalists couldn't be happier that they've
[04:38.000 --> 04:45.120]  got whites and blacks and Hispanics at each other's throats. So I'm going to break that
[04:45.120 --> 04:53.120]  down. Also, a couple of weeks ago, Keith Olbermann did a commentary piece titled Sacrifice and
[04:53.120 --> 04:59.900]  I'd been so busy I'd never watched it and he basically came out and he said Bush is
[04:59.900 --> 05:07.640]  engaging in human sacrifice. This is about human sacrifice. When he says sacrifice. And
[05:07.640 --> 05:15.880]  I wanted to dovetail that with a video analysis I did of occultic war memorials in Canada,
[05:15.880 --> 05:21.920]  the US and England. So that's coming up too, a bunch of economic news, a bunch of Iran
[05:21.920 --> 05:29.120]  war news, a bunch of police state news, it's just huge broadcasts coming up, stay with
[05:29.120 --> 05:40.540]  us. The websites are prisonplanet.com, infowars.net, prisonplanet.tv. It's here, after a year introduction
[05:40.540 --> 05:45.540]  and traveling to distant lands, my new film Terror Storm is complete. Shocking declassified
[05:45.540 --> 05:49.700]  government documents prove that Western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their
[05:49.700 --> 05:55.460]  own populations as a pretext to enslave them. Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11
[05:55.460 --> 06:00.320]  an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[06:00.320 --> 06:04.560]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, the White House program
[06:04.560 --> 06:10.880]  to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information
[06:10.880 --> 06:15.080]  and much, much more. Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government sponsored
[06:15.080 --> 06:20.440]  terrors. It's an anthology of government crimes. Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants
[06:20.440 --> 06:26.620]  to be truly informed must see. Get your copy today at infowars.com or prisonplanet.com

[07:39.180 --> 07:45.060]  tired of that girl's squeaky voice. I'm sure the bed fan works, but that squeaky voice...Well,

[07:57.580 --> 08:01.180]  You're always throwing the covers off in the middle of the night. I guess you're right.
[08:01.180 --> 08:04.980]  Why don't we try it? Just think how nice it'll be to sleep through the night. Yeah, and just
[08:04.980 --> 08:09.020]  think how nice it'll be this summer and all the money we can save on air conditioning.
[08:09.020 --> 08:12.700]  I know where we can get some more information. Sleep disorder centers across the country
[08:12.700 --> 08:16.340]  recommend that you must stay cool to get a good night's sleep. The bed fan will keep

[08:35.340 --> 08:41.260]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show because there's
[08:41.260 --> 09:01.260]  a war on for your mind. The European Union's Gross Domestic Product
[09:01.260 --> 09:09.980]  has surpassed that of the United States. Its currency has dwarfed the value of the
[09:09.980 --> 09:18.180]  plunging dollar. The United States is now universally hated across the world and I want
[09:18.180 --> 09:21.580]  to do a brief analysis on that subject and I want to get into Keith Uberman's piece a
[09:21.580 --> 09:27.580]  few weeks ago about sacrifice and the troops because now we've got the numbers in, record
[09:27.580 --> 09:33.460]  numbers of U.S. troops dying on a daily basis since a week and a half ago when they started
[09:33.460 --> 09:42.660]  putting in the first of 21,600 troops, mainly in Baghdad, in 16 unarmed, undefended substations.
[09:42.660 --> 09:47.300]  Every military strategist, even neo-con Oliver North said it was totally insane and would
[09:47.300 --> 09:52.280]  get all the troops killed. Well, you better believe it, it's a human sacrifice. The Aztecs
[09:52.280 --> 09:57.920]  killed their warriors, that was their favorite sacrifice and believe me folks, that is exactly
[09:57.920 --> 10:04.640]  what they're doing. Literally. This is occultic. They believe they're getting power out of
[10:04.640 --> 10:10.720]  it. That's why Stalin and Hitler did what they did. It is occultic sacrifice and I'm
[10:10.720 --> 10:14.760]  sorry if you have trouble dealing with that. It's totally insane but the people running
[10:14.760 --> 10:22.600]  things are insane. And anyone who's got a brain knows it and Keith Uberman knows it.
[10:22.600 --> 10:28.400]  But I want to go back to a piece we just put out for prisonplanet.tv members. Well part
[10:28.400 --> 10:35.480]  one went up last Friday, part two went up yesterday. We took the footage I shot in England,
[10:35.480 --> 10:40.320]  footage I shot in Canada, never before seen stuff, footage we shot a few weeks ago in
[10:40.320 --> 10:46.840]  Austin, Texas showing war memorials and police memorials and they will always have the goddess
[10:46.840 --> 10:53.720]  Diana or the several other goddesses, that's who the Illuminati mainly worships, is the
[10:53.720 --> 11:00.400]  goddess, looking down always on the memorial that will then list the numbers of dead and
[11:00.400 --> 11:05.600]  then that is a sacrifice to her. And I show it in Austin, I show it in Ottawa, Canada
[11:05.600 --> 11:11.820]  in the capital, I show it in London and anytime you see a big goddess riding a triumphant
[11:11.820 --> 11:17.480]  stallion or in a chariot, a lot of times it will say this is a sacrifice of the order
[11:17.480 --> 11:26.320]  of death. It says that in England, it says the glorious order of death, their sacrifice
[11:26.320 --> 11:31.760]  to the mother and man there's a giant goddess standing right over it with pleasure, her
[11:31.760 --> 11:43.320]  eyes will be locked on the obelisk or on the tomb and it is laid before her lovingly.
[11:43.320 --> 11:49.240]  The Texas peace officer's memorial behind the capital here in Austin is a giant black
[11:49.240 --> 11:53.960]  pentagram, it's just a huge black pentagram, with two obelisks sticking out of the middle
[11:53.960 --> 12:01.680]  of it, with occultic writing all over it, I mean it's just, if you were running along
[12:01.680 --> 12:05.880]  to the jungle in Paraguay or something and you came across it you'd say you'd found an
[12:05.880 --> 12:12.480]  ancient pagan monument, but no, it's just a police officer memorial, it's no big deal,
[12:12.480 --> 12:17.680]  big black pentagram. So we'll be talking about that because it dovetails into what Hutton
[12:17.680 --> 12:23.600]  Gibson, breaking his silence after two plus years joining us in the second hour, will
[12:23.640 --> 12:32.280]  be discussing. But right now, let me get into the collapse of the United States and this
[12:32.280 --> 12:39.280]  is only the beginning. I remember old timers, back when I was waking up fifteen years ago,
[12:39.280 --> 12:43.200]  years before I got on air, they would say there's a plan to destroy our military, to
[12:43.200 --> 12:47.040]  debase it, to put our troops in all these foreign lands and then incrementally they're
[12:47.040 --> 12:51.360]  going to merge our police with foreign police and military and they're going to take down
[12:51.360 --> 13:00.080]  the United States. And so many people got the documents, they had news articles going
[13:00.080 --> 13:04.040]  back to the thirties, forties, fifties, sixties, you know they weren't just crystal balling
[13:04.040 --> 13:11.080]  this, they knew. They understood what was happening and you've heard many of them over
[13:11.080 --> 13:16.320]  the last twelve years on the show talk about it. And it's hard to believe, but it's hard
[13:16.320 --> 13:20.440]  to believe that 3.9 trillion will be missing from the Pentagon or that Dimecor and Halliburton
[13:20.520 --> 13:23.880]  will be publicly running child kidnapping ranks and it will be in the newspaper and
[13:23.880 --> 13:28.240]  no one will get in trouble. I mean, truth is stranger than fiction with these devils
[13:28.240 --> 13:36.440]  that we're talking about. So I want to start with the decline of the US by getting into
[13:36.440 --> 13:46.000]  foreign troops. In plain view, they announced six years ago, and it was in the Washington
[13:46.000 --> 13:51.400]  Post and the Washington Times, that they weren't just hiring illegal aliens to then
[13:51.400 --> 14:00.800]  become naturalized immigrants who were getting green cards to join the military for three
[14:00.800 --> 14:06.040]  to five year stints and then get citizenship afterwards. And it said that the military
[14:06.040 --> 14:11.280]  was recruiting out of the prisons the illegal aliens who were aggravated felons and that
[14:11.280 --> 14:20.800]  they wanted aggravated felons. I made a pretty big deal out of that. And I think it's important.
[14:20.800 --> 14:25.080]  And then a few weeks ago, the AP and the Boston Globe and others came out with headlines like
[14:25.080 --> 14:28.680]  military considering recruiting foreigners. And then you read the first paragraph it said,
[14:28.680 --> 14:32.600]  well, they've already been doing it for years, but now they're expanding it with recruiting
[14:32.600 --> 14:41.560]  stations in Manila, Mexico City, Ukraine, everywhere. And I've seen the numbers that
[14:41.560 --> 14:52.880]  20% plus of the ground forces in the army in Iraq were illegal alien legalized via we're
[14:52.880 --> 14:59.320]  signing up. And a lot of this is under hat only some of its public and the stuff we know
[14:59.320 --> 15:04.800]  is just off the chart bad. So everybody needs to understand the old timers were right. It
[15:04.800 --> 15:13.840]  isn't going to be red dawn with foreign troops parachuting down to the schoolyards and cornfields
[15:13.840 --> 15:17.840]  or jumbo jets landing in major cities and the nose is popping off and tanks rolling
[15:17.840 --> 15:24.480]  off with Russians, you know, leading Cuban forces. It's our government like Kissinger
[15:24.480 --> 15:30.960]  said in 91 and heavy in France, how to paraphrase, you can pull the quote up online. He said,
[15:30.960 --> 15:34.880]  Americans, you know, wouldn't put up with foreign troops in Los Angeles, UN troops,
[15:34.880 --> 15:39.440]  but they will if there's a big enough global crisis, they would willingly accept world
[15:39.440 --> 15:45.600]  government as their savior. That's basically word for word, it's a longer quote, just go
[15:45.600 --> 15:53.240]  pull up Henry kissing your foreign troop quote, it'll, it'll pop up. And then I remember four
[15:53.280 --> 15:58.600]  years ago, it's actually five time flies, I put it in road to tyranny in early 2002. I show the
[15:58.600 --> 16:06.080]  Associated Press, where it says a deal was signed with Mexico and Canada for and you can pause the
[16:06.080 --> 16:12.560]  video, you can read it, it's up on the screen, mainstream news, to quote, patrol America and
[16:12.560 --> 16:18.680]  deal with with terrorists in the US. It says foreign troops will deal with Americans, but
[16:18.680 --> 16:26.200]  they're mainstream. And then when they did the Defense Authorization Act, a few months ago last
[16:26.200 --> 16:33.120]  year, it was in army times that that the President took over the governor's been controls them,
[16:33.120 --> 16:38.160]  quote, during times of insurrection or rebellion or resistance, and a bunch of other terms,
[16:38.160 --> 16:44.480]  dealing with the American people. And it went on to say that in a mutual defense pact that they're
[16:44.480 --> 16:51.680]  going to use foreign troops in the US. And there were three articles in the newspaper in the
[16:51.680 --> 16:58.560]  military newspaper about this. I mean, this is just this is wonderful. This is good. So according
[16:58.560 --> 17:07.920]  to them, so as a country, your country is gone. When your military has a large, really any
[17:07.920 --> 17:16.560]  contingent, but a large contingent of foreign born, non US citizen soldiers, a motley crew,
[17:16.560 --> 17:26.200]  a former Eastern Bloc, of African or I forgot that part of Mexican, Guatemalan, Panamanian,
[17:26.200 --> 17:32.360]  Nicaraguan, I mean, this is Brazilian, this is off the charts. And if you don't think they won't go
[17:32.360 --> 17:36.000]  house to house and try to take your guns, if you don't think they won't load you on trucks, and if
[17:36.000 --> 17:40.240]  you don't think they won't bust a cap in you. And if you don't think these people that put American
[17:40.240 --> 17:44.720]  flags all over their cars made in China, again, desecrated American flags, if you don't, they'll
[17:44.720 --> 17:49.760]  do they'll serve whatever the state says, folks, these go out of these good old boys, they'll turn
[17:49.760 --> 17:56.240]  their guns in and they will march down at a parade as as is in course, they'll have US troops leading
[17:56.240 --> 18:03.920]  the parade and on the loudspeakers, but leading huge foreign forces. Down the middle of our
[18:03.920 --> 18:09.680]  street, these people will sit there and cry and salute them and run up and just lick their boots
[18:09.680 --> 18:17.760]  in a New York minute. I'm not kidding when I say this. Already 20% of the army ground force is
[18:17.760 --> 18:23.680]  illegal alien, mainly Mexican. Okay. Now they're setting up huge recruiting stations are expanding
[18:23.680 --> 18:30.320]  them, again, in the Philippines, and in Eastern Europe, and in Africa and in Latin America. I mean,
[18:30.320 --> 18:36.800]  they have huge, huge multi million dollar ad buys with billboards, radio and TV ads in Mexico City,
[18:36.800 --> 18:46.080]  and recruiting offices in Mexico City. And remember the footage we got at 95 96 97.
[18:46.080 --> 18:55.360]  Patriots got we put it in our police state films of camps in Louisiana, where it is it is Ukrainian
[18:55.360 --> 19:01.040]  troops. And it is Czech Republic troops saying we love this training. This is wonderful. And
[19:01.040 --> 19:04.640]  the role players are saying I'm an American, and they're practicing going house to house taking
[19:04.640 --> 19:10.480]  your guns. And then I've been to urban warfare drills were Dutch troops, British troops, Israeli
[19:10.480 --> 19:18.000]  troops, French troops. Other foreign troops are they're running around with role players screaming
[19:18.000 --> 19:22.240]  I'm an American I have rights don't take my guns don't put me in a camp and I gave you video of it.
[19:22.560 --> 19:26.800]  The military talks about how they're going to execute Americans and they haven't get on their
[19:26.800 --> 19:35.040]  knees as they practice blowing our heads off. You know, you can't make this type of stuff up. But
[19:35.040 --> 19:40.160]  people couldn't believe it. I still get emails saying I hired an aircraft carrier, the troop
[19:40.160 --> 19:46.320]  carrier, Coronado, and I hired helicopters and 3000 Marines and 2000 foreign troops and hovercraft
[19:46.320 --> 19:52.000]  and warrior fighting vehicles. That would be a $50 million budget. No, that's real. And you
[19:52.000 --> 19:57.360]  can go to the Marine Corps website and read about urban warrior 99. But you won't do that. You'll
[19:57.360 --> 20:05.760]  just deny it and say it isn't real and say it isn't true, won't you? Fine, just go right ahead.
[20:07.360 --> 20:12.000]  So when we get back, I'm going to just go over how they destroyed our country in the world's eyes
[20:12.000 --> 20:18.560]  all by design, all by design. And all you good old boys, you think you're part of the power structure
[20:18.640 --> 20:23.280]  and think this is America's whooping up on some people. You couldn't be more wrong.
[20:24.560 --> 20:29.360]  The war in Iraq is more about destroying the US in the world's eyes than it is anything else.
[20:30.160 --> 20:32.560]  But you aren't sophisticated enough to get that.
[20:36.880 --> 20:42.080]  Do you know the truth about cancer treatments? Do you realize that with all presently accepted
[20:42.080 --> 20:47.920]  methods, you are not correctly attacking the cancer and you are mostly fighting to survive
[20:47.920 --> 20:53.040]  the treatment? Do you realize that mutilating surgery, burning, and the poisoning of your
[20:53.040 --> 21:01.040]  entire system are totally unnecessary? But now it's cancer's turn to die with Lace Med Inks,
[21:01.040 --> 21:07.440]  patented methodology. Without cutting, bleeding, drugs, or damaging radiation, we can destroy
[21:07.440 --> 21:13.680]  skin cancer and breast tumors of any size without adverse side effects at our physician's office.

[21:30.880 --> 21:40.240]  Call 702-953-0267. David J. Smith for NewsWatch magazine. Did you know that the
[21:40.240 --> 21:45.840]  Lenin School of Political Warfare has laid down a plan for a third world war that will destroy
[21:45.840 --> 21:51.520]  both Christianity and communism at the same time? From the rebels of this war, the Illuminati will
[21:51.520 --> 21:57.280]  establish their world government prophesied in Revelation chapter 13. Communism said they would
[21:57.280 --> 22:02.880]  pretend to collapse and when America had begun to disarm, the combined communist world would
[22:02.880 --> 22:08.480]  launch a surprise attack and smash us with their clenched fists. We'd like to show you how these
[22:08.480 --> 22:12.880]  things are coming to pass by offering you an absolutely free one year subscription to

[22:33.120 --> 22:39.760]  Nuclear reactors provide economical energy, but would you be prepared during an accident?
[22:39.760 --> 22:44.720]  During nuclear disasters, great amounts of radioactive iodine are released into the
[22:44.720 --> 22:50.160]  atmosphere, which are then readily absorbed into the body. Medical course potassium iodate gives
[22:50.160 --> 22:55.360]  you virtually complete protection from the most feared consequence of a nuclear accident.
[22:55.360 --> 23:00.480]  Radioactive poisoning. Potassium iodate can protect against radioactive poisoning by filling
[23:00.480 --> 23:06.480]  the thyroid with good iodine. This shields the thyroid and prevents it from absorbing the harmful
[23:06.480 --> 23:12.320]  radioactive iodine. Potassium iodate is better than the iodide form because it is not as likely
[23:12.320 --> 23:19.040]  to cause upset stomachs in children, the elderly, the sick, and pets. Order the official potassium
[23:19.040 --> 23:28.320]  iodate for only $24 and save $5 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438. Call now and get
[23:28.320 --> 23:38.160]  pre-shipping. That's 888-803-4438. Ted Anders from Formidus, January 23rd, 2007. Gold, 642.
[23:38.160 --> 23:45.200]  Ounce gold coins are at 663. $330,405 for half and $167.02 for quarter ounce coins at 663.
[23:45.200 --> 23:52.720]  $330,405 and $167.02. 1971, Nixon closes the gold window. Fiat currency, 1920s. The German
[23:52.720 --> 23:59.520]  mark explodes from $75 to $23 trillion. 1995, gold doubles against the Mexican peso. 1997,
[23:59.520 --> 24:04.880]  gold increases 82% over the Indonesian rupee. 1998, gold jumps two-thirds over the Russian
[24:04.880 --> 24:10.800]  ruble. 2002, the Argentine peso loses a fifth of its value to gold. 2006, the last superpower of
[24:10.800 --> 24:15.360]  the USA's mighty dollar loses over half to gold and other raw goods. Could government let this
[24:15.360 --> 24:20.000]  happen? Without immediate backing, how much will it lose? Midas has Nick Barashev's report covering
[24:20.000 --> 24:24.240]  the loss of purchasing power, fat tail events, bull market economic vulnerabilities, and gold
[24:24.240 --> 24:29.760]  oil relationship. You've lost half of your purchasing power. Call 800-686-2237 before
[24:29.760 --> 24:44.080]  the rest disappears. That's 800-686-2237. The last ditch effort to defend the Republic
[24:44.080 --> 24:51.680]  as it passes beneath the waves is taking place right now. If we can only admit who the enemy is
[24:52.480 --> 24:58.320]  and face the true crises, we may be able to salvage our beautiful, wonderful,
[24:59.920 --> 25:09.440]  230 plus year old nation. The battle is now. This is an alarm to the entire planet. The United
[25:09.440 --> 25:15.200]  States is being destroyed by design from within. We are under siege from within and without.
[25:18.240 --> 25:26.640]  All the new order plans are coming to fruition unfolding today. Think about it. Foreign troops
[25:26.640 --> 25:34.400]  openly becoming a large portion of our military to domestically operate against the American people.
[25:34.400 --> 25:44.080]  This is incredible. Meanwhile, I have the BBC today. View of US global role worsens. The view
[25:44.080 --> 25:50.240]  of the US role in the world has deteriorated both internationally and domestically. A BBC poll
[25:50.240 --> 25:56.720]  suggests the world survey conducted in 25 nations, including the US, found that three in four
[25:56.720 --> 26:02.640]  respondents disapprove of how Washington dealt with Iraq. The majority of the 26,318 respondents
[26:02.640 --> 26:08.000]  who disapproved of the way five other foreign policy areas had been handled. The poll released
[26:08.000 --> 26:12.560]  ahead of President Bush's State of the Union speech was conducted between November and January.
[26:13.200 --> 26:16.800]  The number of those who said the US was a positive influence in the world
[26:16.800 --> 26:23.200]  fell in 18 nations polled in previous years. In those countries, 29% of the people said the US
[26:23.200 --> 26:30.320]  had a positive influence, down from 36% last year and 40% two years ago. Across the 25 countries
[26:30.320 --> 26:35.280]  polled, 49% of respondents in the US played a mainly negative role in the world. All right.
[26:37.200 --> 26:49.360]  Also, I have a report here with the GDP of the euro of the European Union for the first time,
[26:50.720 --> 26:52.800]  like a higher GDP than the United States.
[26:52.800 --> 26:59.200]  It's gross domestic product, its economy growing many times faster.
[27:01.120 --> 27:05.760]  This is happening right now. So let me break down how this happens. The International Crime
[27:05.760 --> 27:12.320]  Syndicate funded the communist. The system is not communist. It uses communist. It uses fascist,
[27:12.320 --> 27:17.200]  uses anything centralized as one of their top strategists. Carol quickly wrote in Tragedy and
[27:17.200 --> 27:27.680]  Hope a 900 plus page book in 1968. They funded the Soviets to take over areas of Europe and then
[27:27.680 --> 27:34.320]  the globalists could blame the Soviets for being the prime mover behind it while the whole time
[27:34.320 --> 27:39.120]  they were financed and controlled by large central banks, the Rockefellers, Armand Hammer,
[27:39.120 --> 27:44.960]  and the rest of these people. Just like David Rockefeller helped engineer the buildup of China
[27:44.960 --> 27:49.200]  and brags about it in his autobiography and brags about it in New York Times editorials.
[27:51.920 --> 27:56.160]  So they build up these totalitarian systems, whatever name you give them.
[27:57.040 --> 28:04.720]  They're totalitarian, authoritarian, tyrannical, despotic, abusive, imperious, imperial.
[28:04.720 --> 28:15.360]  And they run them out until they collapse taking over the next nations. That's the program of
[28:16.000 --> 28:18.720]  exploitation of the nation to use it against the next country.
[28:20.000 --> 28:26.080]  And they are now doing that with the United States. They've always hated our middle class.
[28:26.080 --> 28:30.880]  They've always hated our free market. They hated the fact that previous to the experiment with
[28:30.880 --> 28:37.440]  our republic, a tiny handful of people controlled most of the wealth on the planet. That shifted to
[28:37.440 --> 28:44.800]  4%, which sounds tiny, but is much larger than the current and previously. 4% then had half the
[28:44.800 --> 28:50.800]  world's wealth. We've now 4% that is the US population only has about 30% of the wealth.
[28:50.800 --> 28:57.120]  It's being extracted from us. So it's a process of using us up, using up our military, breaking
[28:57.120 --> 29:01.520]  our military down, destroying the military's morale, making the troops serve three, four tours.
[29:02.960 --> 29:08.640]  Then having the war be unjust, having Rupert Murdoch own newspapers internationally demonize
[29:08.640 --> 29:13.840]  the US while domestically propagandizing the public that it's good to keep you in the trap
[29:13.840 --> 29:20.400]  just long enough until it's too late for you to stop it. That's important that the very same news
[29:20.400 --> 29:25.520]  syndicates demonize us internationally and we're the big demon. The war is wrong. The WMDs were
[29:25.600 --> 29:30.320]  staged. It's all a lie. And then domestically, oh, it's all good and everybody loves us and
[29:30.320 --> 29:35.440]  everything's fine. So, so the bankers get to sit back in Europe and London and New York
[29:35.440 --> 29:41.200]  while our military and our country's treasure and our blood is used to take over entire regions
[29:41.200 --> 29:45.520]  and destabilize entire regions. Huge additional debts are run up.
[29:46.880 --> 29:51.920]  And so it's about OPM. It's about trillions in oil, hundreds of billions in weapons sales,
[29:52.720 --> 29:58.960]  permanent bases, destabilizing regions, but it's more about a police state domestically driving us
[29:58.960 --> 30:05.520]  into total debt and demonizing us worldwide. So the last lone superpower can then be knocked out
[30:05.520 --> 30:11.360]  and merged in to a world parliamentary system. And that's what the UN and others are doing.
[30:11.360 --> 30:16.480]  They're demonizing the crimes and blaming all of the global agenda on US
[30:17.120 --> 30:19.920]  Neocons when they're just puppets of these people.
[30:21.200 --> 30:23.600]  I'll continue with how they set us up for a fall.
[30:25.760 --> 30:32.400]  We're on the march. The empire's on the run. Alex Jones and the GCN radio network.
[30:36.000 --> 30:40.080]  I found this company online and they had this really unique variety of salt wellness products.
[30:40.080 --> 30:44.560]  I read some of the articles and ended up ordering this beautiful salt land. According to the
[30:44.640 --> 30:49.840]  company, they said that the salt crystal lamps gently purify indoor air. I was so amazed. I put
[30:49.840 --> 30:54.000]  it in the baby's room and it made a perfect nightlight. Both my husband and I could tell
[30:54.000 --> 30:59.280]  the difference. Soleilwellness.com is a unique company that offers salt wellness products from
[30:59.280 --> 31:04.480]  around the world. So I went back to the site and ordered their Soleil simple natural cleaning
[31:04.480 --> 31:09.600]  products also made with Himalayan salt. I figured it would clean really well and natural cleaning
[31:09.600 --> 31:14.000]  products worked wonderfully and there was no scent. This company has so many products. My
[31:14.000 --> 31:18.800]  whole family can enjoy and feel better with. Plus the service was great. If you're interested
[31:18.800 --> 31:25.040]  in natural homeopathic time-tested remedies visit Soleilwellness.com. That's S-O-L-A-Y

[32:31.600 --> 32:41.680]  Once again wrist ease dot com. Pinch me Bill. I can't believe it. A few months ago I couldn't even
[32:41.680 --> 32:47.760]  afford gas for my car and here we are with season tickets on the 50 yard line. I know what you mean
[32:47.760 --> 32:53.440]  John. I remember the day you saw my new car and asked me if I robbed Bill Gates. Our lives sure
[32:53.440 --> 32:58.720]  have changed since we discovered did you rob Bill Gates dot com. I was struggling to make ends meet.
[32:58.720 --> 33:03.840]  Now I've got a new car and a college fund for Lisa when she graduates from high school next year
[33:03.840 --> 33:10.160]  and I owe it all to you because you told me about did you rob Bill Gates dot com. Hey John, we all
[33:10.160 --> 33:14.960]  win when the money problems disappear. I want to tell everybody because the more people we have on
[33:14.960 --> 33:19.920]  the success team the better it works. It's hard for the little guy these days. We pool our
[33:19.920 --> 33:26.640]  resources to level the playing field so the more people that go to www.didyourobbillgates.com
[33:26.640 --> 33:30.880]  the more cash for everybody. What a concept.
[33:44.960 --> 34:12.160]  I'll send an SOS to the world.
[34:12.160 --> 34:20.160]  That's what we're doing right here right now. Alright John, Mark, Sam, Andrew I'm going to get to you
[34:20.160 --> 34:23.440]  but I'm going to move to you quickly because I got a couple clips I want to play and a lot of other news here.
[34:24.960 --> 34:30.000]  But everything the new order has done and they put this in policy reports it's even in their textbooks
[34:30.000 --> 34:33.760]  it's break up the family for the good of the state. The family is a disease.
[34:33.760 --> 34:38.240]  Break down the border. Get everybody internally fighting with each other in the name of
[34:38.320 --> 34:43.360]  multiculturalism. It actually pronounces people's differences and actually gets you thinking about
[34:43.360 --> 34:50.640]  it. You see everything they say you know the name says one thing but the real action is 180 degrees.
[34:50.640 --> 34:56.640]  It's like calling it the Patriot Act. It's totally anti-patriotic or it's like calling it you know
[34:56.640 --> 35:02.480]  net neutrality and the bill actually ends freedom on the web. So they do a lot of that mislabeling
[35:03.200 --> 35:08.480]  and at every point they've done everything they can to shut down U.S. industry. Everything they
[35:08.480 --> 35:13.600]  can to move it offshore which gives the multinationals the power. 46. Please don't email me
[35:13.600 --> 35:18.880]  saying I said 44. The number now changed. It's worse. I know for a couple years I've been saying
[35:18.880 --> 35:26.400]  44 that's Forbes of the biggest 100 economies were corporations now it's 46. They are governments.
[35:27.920 --> 35:31.520]  This is what libertarians don't get. A lot of them they say we just got to leave corporations alone
[35:31.520 --> 35:35.840]  it's free market. No they don't operate in free market. They operate in monopolies.
[35:35.840 --> 35:40.880]  They have become governmental and they lobby government to then bequeath to them or advocate
[35:40.880 --> 35:50.880]  to them governmental powers. It's neo-feudal mercantile fascism and the neo-libs and neo-cons
[35:50.880 --> 35:55.680]  are all on the same team and they've done everything they can to unravel this society
[35:55.680 --> 36:00.560]  and to destroy our morals and destroy our fiber. People out there think they're trendy and cool
[36:00.560 --> 36:04.560]  and think what do you mean morals to destroy our morals to make us weak? What's that mean?
[36:05.280 --> 36:09.840]  I'm talking about morals of standing up against corruption. Morals of getting angry. Morals of
[36:09.840 --> 36:14.240]  willing to get in a fight when somebody does you know does you wrong or just or tries to take your
[36:14.240 --> 36:20.080]  liberty. I mean when you don't have morals you're just a bunch of slack-jawed bug-eyed fools.
[36:21.760 --> 36:27.440]  A bunch of jackasses and that's what they've turned us into. A bunch of self-centered people.
[36:27.440 --> 36:31.440]  If you really care about yourself you care about others because you know if somebody
[36:31.440 --> 36:36.880]  else is being abused you can be abused. So they've basically dismantled the country.
[36:36.880 --> 36:42.720]  Now they've puffed the bubble up. They devalued the dollar. They have gotten public, private,
[36:42.720 --> 36:48.400]  corporate. Everything is at record levels of debt. Higher level than debt in any time in US history.
[36:48.400 --> 36:54.320]  We broke the record in the middle of 2006. Previously the record of personal debt which
[36:54.320 --> 36:59.920]  was a negative debt load on average. We're more in debt than the average person is. It has a
[36:59.920 --> 37:08.720]  negative balance. The previous record was late 1933 the depths four years in to a depression.
[37:11.280 --> 37:18.480]  So it's amazing but they can't pop the bubble completely until their police state is in place
[37:18.480 --> 37:22.800]  and until everybody's watched 24 where they torture children almost every episode and
[37:22.800 --> 37:28.000]  secret police arrest everyone and there's concentration camps. See all these shows CSI
[37:28.000 --> 37:32.720]  and all of them just brainwashed and there's dozens of them that condition you that the good
[37:32.720 --> 37:37.040]  guys wear black and they torture people and the secret arrest and cameras are everywhere and it
[37:37.040 --> 37:43.280]  keeps us safe. They can't move fully to implode the economy totally and move into their next phase
[37:43.280 --> 37:48.480]  until they think you're sold on going along with it when they pull the rug out from under us.
[37:48.480 --> 37:54.880]  And I mean again for every bureaucrat listening every cop listening every person who's been on a
[37:54.880 --> 37:59.040]  power trip have been part of the system you better check out my claims because I'm telling you the
[37:59.040 --> 38:05.280]  truth and I'm your friend and I know most of you aren't bad you're just misguided and but I'm
[38:05.280 --> 38:12.400]  telling you right now that this this the people that are running our country killed 60 million
[38:12.400 --> 38:20.320]  people conservatively in Russia 60 million conservatively in China and Hitler killed
[38:20.320 --> 38:26.480]  between 20 and 30 million if you count 12 million Germans it's really over that I don't know what to
[38:26.480 --> 38:33.600]  say here I mean these people like to kill these people get into being the most hardcore ruthless
[38:34.240 --> 38:38.480]  their religion is about being totally worthless and they look at people like myself and you out
[38:38.480 --> 38:43.520]  there that have morals and have empathy and care about others they talk about how we're weak
[38:43.520 --> 38:48.240]  how we're stupid they believe it's survival of the fittest they believe that that it's their right to
[38:48.240 --> 38:54.640]  rule us because they don't have a conscience it is a guild of psychopaths who now run the planet
[38:54.640 --> 38:59.680]  they're going after the last rogue sovereign nations shutting them down attacking them
[38:59.680 --> 39:05.360]  sanctions invasions and they are attacking our families our culture we are all under attack
[39:05.360 --> 39:12.400]  whether you're a black man in South Africa or a white man in Germany or a Jew in Israel or a
[39:12.400 --> 39:19.120]  Mexican in Mexico we are all together we are all under attack by the new world order
[39:20.400 --> 39:24.240]  and you've got these Mexican drug gangs and I've been on their websites I've seen their
[39:24.240 --> 39:29.520]  spray paint here in Austin you know the head of you teach a kind of study says kill all whites
[39:30.240 --> 39:37.600]  they call blacks myatas which means blackbird and I mean it's a big minority group of that minority
[39:37.600 --> 39:42.720]  I'm not saying it's all but the media just loves the fact that they're now all at each other's
[39:42.720 --> 39:50.320]  throats that were balkanized and they've got big plans for the rica and kista movement that's why
[39:50.320 --> 39:56.240]  the media tries to keep it quiet and tries to suppress the knowledge of it until it's too late
[39:57.200 --> 40:00.800]  the globalists can do anything to bring in the foreign troops who are already joining our
[40:00.800 --> 40:07.440]  military in mass being recruited they can stage race riots economic collapses nuke attacks they
[40:07.440 --> 40:12.000]  can do anything and they may do all three they may release a bio weapon the government's saying
[40:12.000 --> 40:15.920]  all that is going to happen and then don't worry they'll take all your rights when it does to keep
[40:15.920 --> 40:24.720]  you safe and uh it's time to get real it's time to get real about what's happening systematically
[40:26.240 --> 40:28.800]  let's go to uh john john where you're calling from
[40:30.720 --> 40:36.320]  hi alex this is john from magnolia how you doing did you get you off my videotape I sent you
[40:36.320 --> 40:40.800]  yes I did thank you we're going to you know where where in old films they talk about the new world
[40:40.800 --> 40:45.600]  order we're going to use it thank you okay I wanted to talk about the the new world order
[40:45.600 --> 40:49.680]  what's going to happen is uh I think you're right that there's not going to be a new uh
[40:49.680 --> 40:55.200]  red dawn invasion it's going to be a red dog invitation that uh one of the reasons I think
[40:55.840 --> 40:59.280]  that they started this iraq war is to get most of our troops out of the country especially well
[40:59.280 --> 41:03.120]  that's how it happened germany a lot of the countries uh what four or five of them they
[41:03.120 --> 41:09.040]  took over there was no military invasion they just staged coups and took over the governments
[41:09.040 --> 41:14.160]  and then invited them in all these troops are here for security and here to fight the terrorists
[41:14.160 --> 41:18.080]  yeah and the people are going to welcome the saviors they're coming in here to help us in
[41:18.080 --> 41:21.760]  an hour in need and if you resist them you're going to be the the ones that are going to
[41:21.760 --> 41:25.280]  they're going to be well the soviets did the same thing in a score of countries
[41:27.040 --> 41:31.040]  well I think that's the same game plan they're using now because uh they're stripping our
[41:31.040 --> 41:35.040]  national guard reserves that the troops are supposed to be here to defend us uh they're
[41:35.040 --> 41:40.480]  being shipped out to iraq so there ain't gonna be nobody here mostly to the stop them listen
[41:41.120 --> 41:46.080]  they say that by 2010 the majority of infantry army ground forces will be foreigners
[41:47.040 --> 41:53.600]  you can't that is main screen news i mean that is off the chart another thing i want to say
[41:53.600 --> 41:56.880]  something alex is uh nobody's been watching our canadian border and i thought my friend
[41:56.880 --> 42:00.880]  lives right on the canadian border he said the chinese are pouring out of canada into
[42:00.880 --> 42:08.240]  the united states yeah china has excuse me uh canada has unlimited unfettered immigration i
[42:08.240 --> 42:13.040]  was there when i got pulled out of line to be interrogated in ottawa last june at the
[42:13.040 --> 42:17.280]  milderberg meeting and i literally watched the chinese with their chinese passports who
[42:17.280 --> 42:22.080]  were emigrating they just flashed them boom they were in and uh yeah they're just pouring across
[42:22.720 --> 42:26.880]  into this country but don't worry it's easy to get in now it's hard to get out
[42:28.640 --> 42:36.240]  roaches come in they can't get out remember those old ad for the roach motels yeah but he says that
[42:36.240 --> 42:40.720]  they're finding a lot of boats abandoned on the shoreline of of of the detroit river and
[42:40.720 --> 42:44.320]  the st clair river and what they figure is they're buying a boat they're stealing them
[42:44.320 --> 42:48.160]  loading them up coming over here and then just leaving them and moving on inside the united
[42:48.160 --> 42:51.680]  states well there's no figuring about it they open containers up every day full of chinese
[42:51.680 --> 42:55.760]  their ships coming in every night i told them it's the people's liberation army coming across peace
[42:55.760 --> 43:01.120]  field and for all we know it probably is well no it is there's six thousand plus state department
[43:01.120 --> 43:08.320]  admits uh chinese front companies in the u.s and uh it's just unbelievable but don't worry the
[43:08.320 --> 43:13.680]  cops are gonna give arrest you for jaywalking or they're gonna interrogate your kids in school
[43:13.680 --> 43:17.360]  about what's in your medicine cabinet they got cameras in the bathrooms and well don't worry

[48:51.200 --> 48:55.280]  let's go and play that clip from cnn because after we wrote this article yesterday cnn had
[48:55.280 --> 49:01.200]  a piece last night about the uh race killings going on in la and i wanted to play this and
[49:01.200 --> 49:06.400]  then analyze it after the break so let's play part of it now major offensive against the racial and
[49:06.400 --> 49:13.360]  violence it comes just weeks after the killing of a 14 year old black girl allegedly by latino gang
[49:13.360 --> 49:19.760]  members ted woolens brings us the very latest on that tonight this los angeles street is a deadly
[49:19.840 --> 49:25.840]  symbol of a racial divide between blacks and latinos i've been over here for 11 years and
[49:25.840 --> 49:31.760]  i ain't never really crossed across the 206th street 206th street is a dividing line darren
[49:31.760 --> 49:37.840]  brown who lives on 208th says he and other african-americans stay on one side latinos
[49:37.840 --> 49:43.680]  are on the other and if you cross there can be trouble if you do you got a death wish they gonna
[49:44.320 --> 49:49.280]  take you out they're gonna kill you 14 year old cheryl green was recently murdered along the 206th
[49:49.360 --> 49:55.360]  street border the suspects both latinos are facing hate crime charges a week before cheryl green it
[49:55.360 --> 50:00.880]  was 34 year old archero mercado who was shot in his front yard police haven't made an arrest in
[50:00.880 --> 50:06.960]  that case but latinos are blaming blacks who they claim started this war by moving into the
[50:06.960 --> 50:12.160]  neighborhood about 15 years ago the dividing line is this street la assistant police chief
[50:12.160 --> 50:18.640]  charles beck claims much of the tension on a latino gang called 204 he says the gang is
[50:18.640 --> 50:24.480]  motivated by hatred of blacks to the point that the gang's mission according to the police
[50:24.480 --> 50:29.040]  is to get african-americans to leave the neighborhood these police photos show some
[50:29.040 --> 50:35.680]  of the gang's recent hate graffiti this message says move followed by the n-word this gang
[50:35.680 --> 50:41.040]  in a very small area with a very small membership has managed to put itself at the very top of our
[50:41.040 --> 50:47.200]  enforcement uh priority because they target people based on race so why do these latino
[50:47.200 --> 50:52.720]  gang members hate blacks we talked to a 43 year old hispanic man who was questioned by police
[50:52.720 --> 50:57.920]  about the cheryl green murder we can't show his face but listen to some of the things he says
[50:57.920 --> 51:02.160]  about african-americans in his neighborhood just wish they would just leave and go wherever they
[51:02.160 --> 51:06.080]  got to go and just leave us the way we were and everything would be cool we had a nice little
[51:06.080 --> 51:12.880]  nice little community here that is not nice anymore because of him ghettoism it brought
[51:12.880 --> 51:20.240]  low life just dirty man dirty you guys know man black brown tension isn't confined to
[51:20.240 --> 51:25.360]  games or this neighborhood it's a problem in many cities prisons and even some schools

[55:15.600 --> 55:21.360]  sam crossed the majestic mountains to the valleys far below welcome back
[55:21.360 --> 55:26.640]  he talked to his team of huskies let me make some points about the first part of that cnn piece
[55:26.640 --> 55:32.560]  you just heard they are calling murder hate crimes you know it's kind of like those white guys that
[55:32.560 --> 55:36.960]  drug that black guy to death in jasper they all got the death penalty but then the media kept
[55:36.960 --> 55:40.560]  going they haven't been punished they have they wouldn't even give them a hate crime law
[55:42.080 --> 55:45.760]  and they want to use that for your speech folks they want to use it on everybody's speech
[55:46.400 --> 55:51.920]  so there's no need for these so-called hate laws and they also call them two latinos of the
[55:51.920 --> 55:56.560]  suspects and are killing the 14 year old black girl and i went and looked it up they're illegal
[55:56.560 --> 56:02.160]  aliens but see they don't want to say that and in a way that ends up blaming american hispanics
[56:02.160 --> 56:07.760]  u.s hispanics no the majority of the crime is being committed by these illegal aliens
[56:07.760 --> 56:13.600]  that is the majority of hispanic crime those are the crime statistics out of houston and la and
[56:14.400 --> 56:19.920]  those are just the numbers uh also let's get something clear here blacks and whites
[56:21.600 --> 56:26.720]  have gone through political correctness conditioning okay whites more than anyone else
[56:27.760 --> 56:32.800]  but hispanics especially from mexico it's still old world there's still massive racism down there
[56:33.840 --> 56:39.520]  and you're higher up in the social strata the whiter you are and that's the weird thing and
[56:40.000 --> 56:46.640]  people in the u.s don't understand this they don't understand that nazism is extremely popular in
[56:46.640 --> 56:52.480]  latin america so it's a weird amalgamation it's really bizarre and our government is doing
[56:52.480 --> 56:57.360]  everything they can to suppress this cover this up whitewash this the cnn pieces of whitewash you
[56:57.360 --> 57:00.880]  know talk about there was a fight between blacks and hispanics it was all caught on school
[57:00.880 --> 57:06.000]  surveillance cameras it was in the news locally but nationally they just called it people a race
[57:06.000 --> 57:13.200]  of riot no hispanics attacked the minority group of blacks who are now a minority at those schools
[57:13.200 --> 57:17.440]  and it's happening all over the country they're taking down the american flags running up mexican
[57:17.440 --> 57:21.920]  flags it's been all over the news the police come and arrest white and black students that hoist
[57:21.920 --> 57:28.320]  back up the american flag saying it was provocative you see and and and and again
[57:28.320 --> 57:33.840]  most hispanics are wonderful patriotic americans 67 percent in major gallup polls once the illegals
[57:33.840 --> 57:40.800]  deported it's over 90 percent now if you average in all the race groups so it's important we all
[57:40.800 --> 57:44.400]  come together and realize these illegal aliens are being used to balkanize and break down the
[57:44.400 --> 57:49.040]  country look george bush is for an open border he's for amnesty isn't george bush wrong on every
[57:49.040 --> 57:54.720]  other issue so liberals need to understand this and i guess most of them do now that that this
[57:54.720 --> 58:00.640]  is a strategic plan to get us all fighting with each other and to bring in so many newcomers that
[58:00.640 --> 58:06.880]  they can't assimilate in a melting pot that's the bottom line of what's happening here i want to
[58:06.880 --> 58:10.400]  play more than cnn club later we have time because hutton gibson's coming up i want to get him on

[01:02:00.400 --> 01:02:06.160]  first after several years of not doing any interviews on this radio show and he's also i
[01:02:06.160 --> 01:02:09.600]  consider him a good friend of mine we've we've we've met before and i've talked to him many
[01:02:09.600 --> 01:02:14.160]  times on the phone we've interviewed him many times hutton gibson hutton thank you for coming
[01:02:14.160 --> 01:02:19.920]  on with us today oh it's a pleasure i tell you so much has happened since we last talked on
[01:02:19.920 --> 01:02:26.800]  air how many was that like two and a half years ago it must be at least yes well i tell you you
[01:02:26.800 --> 01:02:31.360]  really got misrepresented and attacked in the press but it wasn't successful it seemed to backfire
[01:02:32.240 --> 01:02:36.480]  but we're not going to be getting into those issues today we're going to be talking about
[01:02:36.480 --> 01:02:40.560]  something you're really an expert on and recognized by many traditional catholics as one of the
[01:02:40.640 --> 01:02:45.840]  most uh informed people and and what would you call it just the takeover of the catholic church
[01:02:45.840 --> 01:02:53.040]  or the decline or the masonic the masonic ization what would you call it uh the replacement i would
[01:02:53.040 --> 01:03:00.080]  say what we have there now is nothing like the catholic church i grew up in we've only got a few
[01:03:00.080 --> 01:03:03.680]  minutes before we break give us a little bit of an overview of some of the issues you want to
[01:03:03.680 --> 01:03:14.160]  discuss today well uh for instance the uh church has turned into a discussion society it's meant
[01:03:14.160 --> 01:03:22.960]  to be a missionary society uh the church has four marks it is one holy catholic apostolic
[01:03:23.920 --> 01:03:30.560]  and all those marks are gone in this new church especially the apostolic because that means you
[01:03:30.560 --> 01:03:36.640]  go and preach the word that's what christ said to do and he would be with us all days
[01:03:37.760 --> 01:03:43.440]  to preach his gospel when you stop preaching it you can't expect him to be with you
[01:03:45.360 --> 01:03:52.640]  uh they uh they decided that uh salvation is available everywhere so why would anyone
[01:03:52.640 --> 01:03:56.800]  bother to come to the church which used to be the most difficult road
[01:03:57.120 --> 01:04:06.160]  uh anyway we'll also get into a you've got a list of things here that we've talked about privately
[01:04:06.160 --> 01:04:11.920]  rat singer what he's really doing how he was praying to mecca also how he's been calling
[01:04:11.920 --> 01:04:18.400]  now three times since he got in there uh into the papal seat calling for a new world order
[01:04:18.400 --> 01:04:22.880]  and also you've discovered that a new cathedral they built is really a masonic temple
[01:04:23.680 --> 01:04:33.520]  yes that's uh they put up this building at uh as a shrine to padre pio and when you look at it
[01:04:33.520 --> 01:04:41.600]  you see masonic design everywhere and i mean everywhere it's too uh blatant to be accidental
[01:04:43.120 --> 01:04:51.120]  well like all this stuff in the church entirely it's all too obvious to be accidental it cannot
[01:04:51.440 --> 01:04:56.400]  have happened by accident according to our theology we said that that building is a
[01:04:56.400 --> 01:05:01.840]  demonstration of it they've done pretty much the same down in uh mexico at our shrine of
[01:05:01.840 --> 01:05:06.640]  our lady of guadalupe and then over in portugal at our lady of thatima
[01:05:09.600 --> 01:05:13.120]  huntin gibson we're gonna break we're gonna come back long segment plenty of time to break this
[01:05:13.120 --> 01:05:19.840]  down let's get into rat singer what his agenda is get into the the new uh cathedrals masonic temples
[01:05:20.400 --> 01:05:27.440]  and uh talk about the demonization by different organizations of traditional catholics
[01:05:27.440 --> 01:05:30.640]  which you are one we'll be right back stay with us

[01:08:41.200 --> 01:08:47.200]  all right the stations that just joined us recapping hutton gibson world war ii vet author
[01:08:47.760 --> 01:08:57.200]  researcher traditional catholic leader father of mel gibson joins us he's been misrepresented and
[01:08:57.200 --> 01:09:03.760]  misquoted and twisted by the press and i consider him to be a very a very nice very informed good
[01:09:03.760 --> 01:09:09.600]  person who's done a lot of good works and i wanted you to have a chance to hear what hutton gibson
[01:09:09.600 --> 01:09:16.800]  really has to say from him not from the new york times or 2020 or something else and i'm honored
[01:09:17.360 --> 01:09:20.480]  he hasn't been on the air in about two and a half years since the whole passion of the christ
[01:09:20.480 --> 01:09:28.640]  controversy he is now with his uh maiden voyage here back on talk radio joining us uh hutton i
[01:09:28.640 --> 01:09:35.040]  think the best place to start is how you got disillusioned with the modern catholic church
[01:09:35.040 --> 01:09:40.880]  how it changed and then a few years ago i was reading your book uh the enemy is still here
[01:09:41.760 --> 01:09:48.160]  uh pointing there at rome and large sections are about rat singer you were fingering him then
[01:09:48.160 --> 01:09:56.720]  as one of the prime controllers of the illuminati infiltration and control of the catholic church
[01:09:56.720 --> 01:10:01.680]  the homasonic influence so so if you can break down kind of how you woke up and then who rat
[01:10:01.680 --> 01:10:06.160]  singer is and then i'd like to talk about some of the things he's been doing calling for a one-world
[01:10:06.160 --> 01:10:10.960]  government a one-world religion saying all religions are the same i'd like to go through
[01:10:10.960 --> 01:10:15.520]  that with you and i think once you've illustrated that how could anybody be one of these mainline
[01:10:16.160 --> 01:10:21.360]  uh so-called catholics because they're not really catholics so so please enlighten us on that
[01:10:22.880 --> 01:10:29.360]  well i got into the deal see when i was in this country i was too far from the catholic schools
[01:10:29.360 --> 01:10:35.600]  and my children were not being subjected to this gradual subversion coming into the schools about
[01:10:35.600 --> 01:10:42.640]  1960 and 61 uh when i moved to australia i thought it would be a great idea to send them
[01:10:42.640 --> 01:10:50.000]  to catholic school by gosh i can do this again and uh so i did and about a year later they came
[01:10:50.000 --> 01:10:57.280]  around and showed me what they were using for texts and religion class it wasn't the catechism
[01:10:57.920 --> 01:11:04.800]  it was no uh nothing that had anything to do with the catholic church it was a publication put out
[01:11:04.800 --> 01:11:14.800]  every month and uh the boys at the school which was saint leo's in warunga sydney australia would
[01:11:14.800 --> 01:11:23.280]  take this paper out to the cricket ground and burn it ceremonially so they didn't believe it either
[01:11:24.160 --> 01:11:29.520]  so they knew what was going on yes well i i took a look at this stuff and i got into it with the
[01:11:29.520 --> 01:11:35.360]  cardinal who had just been made a cardinal and freeman and uh he referred me here and
[01:11:35.360 --> 01:11:39.200]  referred me there because he couldn't do anything about it he wasn't very bright
[01:11:40.240 --> 01:11:48.560]  uh and uh i sent him along and straight australian pages are a bit longer than the 11
[01:11:49.200 --> 01:11:57.280]  it's about eight and a quarter by 14 instead and uh i filled up eight pages of that with
[01:11:57.520 --> 01:12:00.160]  the heresies i called out of this
[01:12:02.560 --> 01:12:08.800]  publication this periodical that came out 10 times or 11 times a year they they broke for christmas
[01:12:11.200 --> 01:12:19.600]  so uh and uh he didn't answer me in one way he said we're not here to jam religion down
[01:12:19.600 --> 01:12:26.480]  these boys throats and i thought to myself what are you there for this is why they go
[01:12:26.480 --> 01:12:32.000]  to catholic school to get their religion whether it's jam down their throats or what
[01:12:32.000 --> 01:12:38.640]  they've got to get it and they were not getting it so i got into the battle with him and the next
[01:12:38.640 --> 01:12:43.840]  thing you know i found out that there was a a real mass around somewhere i hadn't noticed so
[01:12:43.840 --> 01:12:50.480]  much i've been traveling i hadn't noticed the changes so much i used to wonder for instance
[01:12:51.280 --> 01:13:00.480]  why did the irish take this lying down and what it comes down to is that they were given the
[01:13:00.480 --> 01:13:07.120]  old patriotic approach and their vernacular was not english it was gaelic and most of them don't
[01:13:07.120 --> 01:13:16.000]  speak it or understand it too well so anyway that's all by the way but in australia they
[01:13:16.000 --> 01:13:22.640]  were the first to go vernacular and uh the translations of course were wretched
[01:13:23.200 --> 01:13:29.040]  and then i found the latin mass society and joined it and found out things are much worse
[01:13:29.040 --> 01:13:41.120]  than i had thought so then i got into it for for fair uh objecting to that uh what they call the
[01:13:41.120 --> 01:13:49.040]  novus ordo missy the new order of mass which came in in 1969 and replaced all these uh translations
[01:13:49.040 --> 01:13:52.160]  that were going here and there and everywhere yeah that's the key they didn't just take out
[01:13:52.160 --> 01:13:58.480]  latin into english or spanish they then changed it and then from that change we move forward
[01:13:59.520 --> 01:14:06.640]  30 years and popes are calling pope john paul ii rat singer uh you know the new guy they're calling
[01:14:06.640 --> 01:14:13.840]  for a new world order there's they're calling hundreds of religions uh to uh the vatican and
[01:14:13.840 --> 01:14:19.280]  saying they're all the same i mean this is 180 degrees from what's in the bible how did this
[01:14:19.280 --> 01:14:26.560]  happen in such a short short space of time historically well mostly uh it was the communist
[01:14:26.560 --> 01:14:34.960]  tactic we educate the young or miss educate the young or fail to educate the young so that we have
[01:14:34.960 --> 01:14:38.800]  two or three generations now which have never seen the catholic church in action
[01:14:41.280 --> 01:14:52.960]  uh when uh when pius the 12th uh leftist in 1958 i was 40 years old i knew my church i'd
[01:14:52.960 --> 01:14:58.160]  been raised catholic all my instruction and all my school formal schooling was catholic
[01:14:58.720 --> 01:15:04.240]  and i got in the army and i was the target for everybody you want to argue religion go see gibson
[01:15:05.120 --> 01:15:12.560]  and i will have to say with a great deal of pride because i never lost an argument but they all
[01:15:12.560 --> 01:15:16.720]  wound up saying to me are you catholics are all alike you're a bunch of sheep you just do what
[01:15:16.720 --> 01:15:23.360]  you're told and i always said nonsense i know exactly what i believe and why but i've figured
[01:15:23.360 --> 01:15:30.560]  out now that most people did not have my education in spite of going through the catholic schools of
[01:15:30.560 --> 01:15:36.480]  course when i got out having argued with all these people i realized i hadn't uh picked up
[01:15:36.480 --> 01:15:43.360]  enough so i went into it in earnest and i have quite a library of catholic books and uh
[01:15:43.360 --> 01:15:49.680]  encyclopedias and dictionaries and various types bibles i've got everything you could imagine here
[01:15:49.680 --> 01:15:56.800]  that kills a double garage it used to be well there's no debating i mean you can debate in
[01:15:56.800 --> 01:16:02.000]  the past all day long but there's no debating now that the catholic church is a pure instrument and
[01:16:02.000 --> 01:16:07.760]  i know you would say it isn't really the catholic church of world government move us forward to rat
[01:16:07.760 --> 01:16:14.320]  singer you start writing books you start speaking out you fingered rat singer a long time ago
[01:16:14.960 --> 01:16:20.640]  well he was one prime mover he was one of these uh what they call parity at vatican II
[01:16:21.600 --> 01:16:30.640]  experienced man it's the same words ex perio ex perio so uh he was there uh advising all these
[01:16:30.640 --> 01:16:36.640]  bishops that had been called together uh most of whom seemed to have left their brains outside the
[01:16:36.640 --> 01:16:44.320]  door and gone in and uh taken all this but there's one thing you can say about vatican II
[01:16:45.040 --> 01:16:52.560]  in contrast to all ages of catholic church and its councils and its doctrines and its accurate
[01:16:53.360 --> 01:17:02.560]  and explicit phraseology you find japan Vatican II which put out more than the largest council
[01:17:02.560 --> 01:17:06.800]  we had before which put out more than all the councils together before that
[01:17:06.800 --> 01:17:14.720]  before that this is a great bank of fog nobody can figure out what it means
[01:17:15.680 --> 01:17:21.520]  it contradicts itself internally it promotes heresies which have been condemned by the church
[01:17:23.680 --> 01:17:28.480]  and uh well rat singer was there he was right there in the beginning
[01:17:28.480 --> 01:17:31.920]  he was helping out to to put it over on these bishops
[01:17:31.920 --> 01:17:41.280]  now fast forwarding then he advanced through the church and he wound up as a so-called cardinal
[01:17:41.280 --> 01:17:49.520]  and a so-called bishop uh and put in charge of the congregation for the doctrine of the faith
[01:17:50.560 --> 01:17:58.000]  which is a change in name of course from the congregation of the holy office
[01:17:58.000 --> 01:18:03.840]  and so he got in a key position over the canons in the doctrine
[01:18:04.480 --> 01:18:09.040]  yes that's correct he was uh there in charge and while they're in charge
[01:18:10.320 --> 01:18:16.960]  he uh promoted a book uh and wrote the preface for it called what is it the uh
[01:18:20.480 --> 01:18:26.400]  it was put out by the congregate pontifical biblical commission and the title of the book
[01:18:26.400 --> 01:18:30.160]  is the hebrew people and their holy scriptures in the christian bible
[01:18:32.880 --> 01:18:40.560]  and then he proceeded to deduce that we should listen to this we should uh accept them because
[01:18:40.560 --> 01:18:48.800]  they may be right now if they are right then we are wrong basically it's what the pharisees were
[01:18:48.800 --> 01:18:55.360]  saying to christ he's saying the pharisees might be the good guys yes that's it they could be right
[01:18:56.160 --> 01:18:59.920]  they're these masoretic scriptures which of course they had in their
[01:18:59.920 --> 01:19:07.760]  hands and and eliminated anything they found distasteful to them over uh well almost two
[01:19:07.760 --> 01:19:16.720]  millennia now uh they we are supposed to take their slant on it because i guess because they
[01:19:16.720 --> 01:19:26.160]  understand hebrew but uh it comes right down to it if saint paul says if christ be not risen then
[01:19:26.160 --> 01:19:33.520]  is our faith vain well we know they disagree on the central fact of history well we know hutton
[01:19:33.520 --> 01:19:38.560]  gibson where they're going with this because now there's no pretense i mean the rat singer is
[01:19:38.560 --> 01:19:44.240]  openly saying new world order one world religion i mean this guy's talking like the anti-christ now
[01:19:44.800 --> 01:19:54.320]  he certainly is and he gets crazier by the day he goes to istanbul and uh while he's there on
[01:19:54.320 --> 01:20:01.440]  another tack he receives these mazums and of course it was staged nothing's done by accident
[01:20:01.440 --> 01:20:09.120]  there he goes to their mosque and he's there i guess with his shoes off during their prayer time
[01:20:09.120 --> 01:20:12.960]  so it was no shock to him that they were going to pray five times a day
[01:20:12.960 --> 01:20:19.840]  they do this and he joins him hutton stay there we've got a break i want to come back and talk
[01:20:19.840 --> 01:20:25.680]  about when you believe the masonic order was able to fully take over the catholic church
[01:20:25.680 --> 01:20:29.760]  and what rat singer's doing where the catholic church or what they call the catholic church
[01:20:29.760 --> 01:20:35.600]  where it's going we'll be right back after this quick break terrorism terrorism chemical attacks

[01:24:44.800 --> 01:24:49.360]  hutton gibson it's a short segment long second coming up after this one
[01:24:52.720 --> 01:24:56.000]  hutton we were talking during the break there's another point you want to discuss
[01:24:56.000 --> 01:25:04.080]  how uh the illuminati crowd when they fully took control also wanted to i guess break the church's
[01:25:04.080 --> 01:25:10.080]  uh goodwill i guess with the public down so they purposefully and they've done this with
[01:25:10.080 --> 01:25:14.080]  the republican party too it's come out in the news you know the male prostitutes all of it
[01:25:14.080 --> 01:25:20.400]  to bring in uh people into leadership positions to basically compromise the church which is a
[01:25:20.400 --> 01:25:26.880]  very old trick and uh you guys were warned about this uh by people that were on the inside of
[01:25:27.760 --> 01:25:33.120]  even before it happened weren't you hutton yes we were there was a
[01:25:33.440 --> 01:25:33.440]  a
[01:25:37.440 --> 01:25:46.400]  bunch of uh people around the turn of the last century the modernists and they were
[01:25:46.400 --> 01:25:53.200]  doing their best to take over the doctrine of the church and the the running of it
[01:25:54.160 --> 01:26:05.280]  uh we almost had one of those fellows elected pope in 1903 cardinal mariano rampolla del tingaro
[01:26:07.760 --> 01:26:14.480]  but the emperor of austria acting in his uh with his hat on holy roman emperor
[01:26:15.680 --> 01:26:22.800]  vetoed him so before he was elected he could not have vetoed him afterwards but he got in before
[01:26:22.880 --> 01:26:32.160]  when it looked like he would be elected so uh the trouble is that he was still there in the church
[01:26:33.760 --> 01:26:39.280]  and acted as secretary of state some of the time to pius the tenth
[01:26:41.760 --> 01:26:48.960]  and he was he contributed to a new code of canon law there had never been no code of canon law in
[01:26:48.960 --> 01:26:56.320]  all church history but it had laws here and decrees there and it was such a jumble that they
[01:26:56.320 --> 01:27:02.240]  put them all together not for any great benefit but simply to have them in one place and this
[01:27:02.240 --> 01:27:11.840]  benefited chiefly the canon lawyers but the people that were in charge of the code and coding this
[01:27:11.840 --> 01:27:23.600]  thing uh were modernist and freemason and they left out a couple of strange laws uh they they
[01:27:23.600 --> 01:27:31.760]  don't uh treat the freemasonry as it as the uh as it had been treated they became an irregularity
[01:27:31.760 --> 01:27:45.040]  instead of uh an apostasy uh this prevented the people from uh if they were caught at it from
[01:27:45.600 --> 01:27:58.240]  functioning as priests bishops anybody but it didn't take away their status
[01:27:59.200 --> 01:28:05.680]  immediately they didn't go in and dig them out and say this is uh a mason they did on the
[01:28:05.680 --> 01:28:09.760]  pius the tenth did on three occasions he chucked out three bishops in france
[01:28:11.680 --> 01:28:17.600]  and one of them became the cause in 1904 of the break between the holy
[01:28:17.600 --> 01:28:22.080]  sea and the french government which of course was freemasonic
[01:28:25.280 --> 01:28:25.840]  so uh
[01:28:28.640 --> 01:28:34.080]  but anyway they left out these laws against freemasons and let let the room for some of
[01:28:34.080 --> 01:28:39.280]  these things to come back in again and uh among the uh
[01:28:39.520 --> 01:28:45.760]  the group around rompola and uh
[01:28:47.920 --> 01:28:56.960]  gaspari was the uh archbishop of uh milan at the time
[01:28:56.960 --> 01:29:09.520]  uh dela chiesa who became benedict the 15th and it was under his uh regime that this canon law
[01:29:09.520 --> 01:29:18.240]  was installed and they say it did not have sufficient safeguards against things one of
[01:29:18.240 --> 01:29:25.680]  the things that we've just come across lately is that the same hope same prize the fifth
[01:29:26.960 --> 01:29:35.520]  who objected to any change in the mass he had to do this either because with the reformation
[01:29:35.520 --> 01:29:41.920]  going on he had to have a mass he could guarantee so he took the oldest mass available and gone way
[01:29:41.920 --> 01:29:50.080]  back in history before anyone can really trace it and this is what he guaranteed and said there
[01:29:50.080 --> 01:29:55.600]  will be no heedless change to this of course there are changes made when they would institute a new
[01:29:55.600 --> 01:30:00.800]  feast you've got a new saint you want to honor or well specifically though we were talking at the
[01:30:00.800 --> 01:30:05.120]  break though you were talking about a law that you guys found that was talking about not having the
[01:30:05.120 --> 01:30:10.400]  pedophiles in there and how it would bring down the church and let the other governments take
[01:30:10.400 --> 01:30:16.400]  over so let's talk about that let's talk about rat singer and how he's calling for new world order
[01:30:16.400 --> 01:30:21.600]  what that means and then that and then that new cathedral that's a masonic temple and a lot more

[01:31:59.760 --> 01:32:04.720]  2008 many people believe that this will be the mark of the beast because of the restrictive
[01:32:04.720 --> 01:32:10.080]  measures included which seems to parallel the no buying and selling of revelations 1317
[01:32:10.080 --> 01:32:16.080]  in revelations 14 9 speaking of the mark of the beast it says if any man worship the beast take
[01:32:16.080 --> 01:32:22.160]  notice it says worship the beast this issue is about worship not economics for a better

[01:33:50.880 --> 01:33:59.600]  author father mel gibson and 10 other children hutton gibson is our guest for those who just
[01:33:59.600 --> 01:34:06.640]  joined us and and i mean every few months some catholic cardinal calls for a one world government
[01:34:06.640 --> 01:34:12.880]  a new world order rat singer has done it three times that's the current so-called pope and so
[01:34:12.880 --> 01:34:17.920]  people could debate all day you know was the catholic church evil 100 years ago was it evil 50
[01:34:17.920 --> 01:34:26.320]  years ago there is no debating there's no debating that this is not the catholic church it was and
[01:34:26.320 --> 01:34:32.160]  there's no debating the fact that it is a total tool of one world government and the symbolism
[01:34:32.160 --> 01:34:36.720]  and the buildings they're building and everything they're doing is pushing for a one world religion
[01:34:38.480 --> 01:34:44.720]  break down for us hutton what rat singer means from your studying of him you've written a book
[01:34:44.720 --> 01:34:52.720]  you know a lot of it's about him about what he means when he says a new world order and why he's
[01:34:52.720 --> 01:34:57.920]  going to mosque and praying to mecca why is he calling for a one world religion i mean this stuff
[01:34:57.920 --> 01:35:06.800]  is right out of revelations well it's uh i think uh almost an axiom that if you're going to have
[01:35:06.800 --> 01:35:11.520]  a one world government you've pretty well got to have a one world religion
[01:35:13.840 --> 01:35:17.520]  people have religion to fight over they'll fight over it
[01:35:18.400 --> 01:35:24.480]  so if they're all in one crew that way that's one big thing eliminated it also
[01:35:25.360 --> 01:35:32.000]  tones the church down to where it will never argue with the government which it should be
[01:35:32.000 --> 01:35:39.360]  doing in any number of cases uh for instance abortion uh
[01:35:39.680 --> 01:35:49.280]  uh and he has his own crew in there now they've been at this for well over a hundred years
[01:35:50.320 --> 01:35:54.320]  getting their people in into the government of the church itself
[01:35:56.240 --> 01:36:05.920]  and the people i don't say all necessarily freemasons but most of them are vulnerable
[01:36:05.920 --> 01:36:15.520]  as were the uh the high muckety mucks at vatican II to blackmail and the blackmail was uh not
[01:36:15.520 --> 01:36:21.600]  necessarily that they belong to the freemations though in a number of cases it was so but in
[01:36:21.600 --> 01:36:33.200]  almost all cases they had their hands in the till or they had girlfriends or they had boyfriends
[01:36:35.920 --> 01:36:43.520]  even a couple of our so-called popes have had boyfriends uh which popes so-called popes had
[01:36:43.520 --> 01:36:51.280]  boyfriends well uh paul the sixth uh a gentleman uh if i may use the term loosely an italian actor
[01:36:51.280 --> 01:36:57.440]  named carlini very handsome man used to dye his hair red which i suppose i should take as a
[01:36:57.440 --> 01:37:06.880]  compliment but he was not uh he could come in and out of the vatican at any time he pleased
[01:37:08.000 --> 01:37:12.160]  and i've spoken to a man who was there and saw this happening
[01:37:14.160 --> 01:37:21.280]  he was a member of the vatican uh what would you call it the the guards he was
[01:37:21.280 --> 01:37:25.920]  there in a position where he could have stopped this man if he hadn't had orders not to
[01:37:28.080 --> 01:37:34.480]  who else what other so-called pope was involved in this well i hate to uh to do this without
[01:37:36.640 --> 01:37:40.960]  what would you call uh going into it in detail and proofing it you know
[01:37:40.960 --> 01:37:48.160]  yeah i i it's a terribly destructive thing and if you have no way to right off hand to prove it
[01:37:48.880 --> 01:37:52.880]  oh i understand then let's not go there i mean but it's we see the same thing in the white house
[01:37:52.880 --> 01:37:58.000]  republican democratic party it's like foley uh the congressman running the missing children
[01:37:58.000 --> 01:38:02.400]  and exploited children program and then turn and then you've got two deputy heads of homeland
[01:38:02.400 --> 01:38:08.480]  security caught raping or trying to rape children uh you've got bohemian grove the franklin coverup
[01:38:08.480 --> 01:38:13.920]  skull and bones you got uh you know even the new york post reporting quote top gay porn star service
[01:38:13.920 --> 01:38:19.840]  moguls at bohemian grove this i guess is part of this illuminati religion uh or i guess it's a
[01:38:19.840 --> 01:38:24.720]  right of passage so they know you're compromised that you be involved in this i think even bigger
[01:38:24.720 --> 01:38:29.040]  than just free masonry and again i'm not saying most masons are low level don't even know what's
[01:38:29.040 --> 01:38:34.480]  going on about high level folks but it seems like it is a rite of passage to do i mean i guess it's
[01:38:34.480 --> 01:38:41.120]  kind of a low level street gang will go you know mugging old lady is a rite of passage so they know
[01:38:41.120 --> 01:38:45.840]  you're really a member of the crew or the mafia you got to kill two people to be a made member
[01:38:45.840 --> 01:38:51.040]  i mean i mean is this a way to get made or why i mean why is this so prolific and it seems to be a
[01:38:51.040 --> 01:38:59.360]  prerequisite well for one thing i suppose you recall della dodd who was a member of the communist
[01:38:59.360 --> 01:39:07.280]  party who uh returned to catholicism and then uh let it be known that she personally had put
[01:39:07.280 --> 01:39:15.600]  1100 or was it 1200 people students into catholic seminaries to study for the priesthood
[01:39:16.560 --> 01:39:21.920]  and when she mentioned this in the 60s she said they're about run they're about running the church
[01:39:21.920 --> 01:39:33.040]  now these people and we have this law of highest the fifth which uh really puts the uh homosexual
[01:39:33.040 --> 01:39:38.800]  out of the business he can't do anything in the church and he should be turned over to
[01:39:38.800 --> 01:39:42.720]  the civil authority and the civil authority at the time simply killed them
[01:39:45.440 --> 01:39:55.200]  uh so this this law was not included in this 1917-18 code and so we have to wonder about
[01:39:55.280 --> 01:40:00.480]  the people that put the code in rampola gospari benedict the 15th
[01:40:01.760 --> 01:40:06.880]  uh but clearly they wanted it so they could then blackmail it's it's the same thing that
[01:40:06.880 --> 01:40:13.600]  that's happening today now uh what is the overall agenda now that these globalists have
[01:40:13.600 --> 01:40:20.000]  have fully gotten control of the catholic church i mean where is all this going hutton
[01:40:20.400 --> 01:40:28.960]  well they've uh managed to uh destroy uh any respect that most people have for the
[01:40:28.960 --> 01:40:37.680]  clergy and especially the hierarchy there's a gentleman in illinois uh stephen brady who puts
[01:40:37.680 --> 01:40:47.120]  out a report every now and then called amdg by your mde gloriam all for the greater glory of god
[01:40:47.920 --> 01:40:56.720]  and he has been fighting these uh queers these homosexuals in the clergy and in the hierarchy
[01:40:57.760 --> 01:41:04.160]  and i i can draw very readily i'm led to believe by his investigation
[01:41:05.120 --> 01:41:10.480]  that 70 percent of the american catholic bishops are queer
[01:41:10.880 --> 01:41:18.080]  so i would i would i would specify and be specific on that though this is a prerequisite for
[01:41:18.080 --> 01:41:23.680]  blackmail so so people out there listening whatever their view on this is uh the point
[01:41:23.680 --> 01:41:29.440]  is this is being done strategically to control the republican party the democratic party and this is
[01:41:29.440 --> 01:41:35.760]  a club then they only let their people in they let in the blackmailable people so they will do
[01:41:36.000 --> 01:41:39.920]  they let in the blackmailable people so they will do what they're damn well told
[01:41:39.920 --> 01:41:43.600]  well you see this in sheriff's departments this this ended up happening in austin
[01:41:43.600 --> 01:41:49.200]  a few years back and uh so so regardless of what people's views are people out there you know who
[01:41:49.200 --> 01:41:54.000]  are liberal modern whatever and say oh you know you guys are being hutton's being you know backward
[01:41:54.000 --> 01:42:02.080]  and bigoted whatever your view is on that hutton is simply stating the fact and and and that 70
[01:42:02.080 --> 01:42:07.360]  percent from the research uh of the bishops are involved in this and i've seen it from my own
[01:42:07.360 --> 01:42:12.320]  research i totally agree with that i would say more than half of the republican leadership is
[01:42:13.120 --> 01:42:19.120]  and uh you know it's been coming out that the chairman of the rnc hashert governors on and on
[01:42:19.120 --> 01:42:23.840]  and on and the point is they it's not just like oh you know these gay people just so happen to
[01:42:23.840 --> 01:42:28.160]  get these positions of power no they're picked as part of this network and i'd go further it's
[01:42:28.160 --> 01:42:33.040]  a lot further than just homosexuality there's also a lot of pedophilia involved in this and
[01:42:33.040 --> 01:42:38.880]  that's how they really like to blackmail people hutton yeah that's true so what percentage from
[01:42:38.880 --> 01:42:45.200]  the research if 70 are homosexual what percentage are involved in going after the altar boys
[01:42:48.160 --> 01:42:51.520]  of the 70 that are queer yeah i would say 100
[01:42:51.520 --> 01:42:59.840]  percent because that that's much worse you can blackmail people better that way
[01:43:00.960 --> 01:43:04.960]  these days it seems to be no crime to throw up your orders and say well i
[01:43:04.960 --> 01:43:12.160]  can't stand this celibacy and go away but that's something else again and as uh you
[01:43:12.160 --> 01:43:19.200]  mentioned in the case of the government people are promoted because they can be told what they must
[01:43:19.200 --> 01:43:27.840]  do it's amazing would you advise somebody then to put somebody in a mainstream uh so-called
[01:43:27.840 --> 01:43:33.360]  catholic school or system if there's this many perverts floating around in there i would not i
[01:43:33.360 --> 01:43:37.920]  think it's one of the worst things you can do these days at least if you're in a public school
[01:43:38.640 --> 01:43:46.560]  while it is dumbed down and perverted it is not officially anti-catholic
[01:43:46.560 --> 01:43:54.480]  uh is that all religion of course you can't bring up religion in this place unless you
[01:43:54.480 --> 01:44:02.080]  bring it in sneak the bible in as a uh history book history book or literature or an yeah
[01:44:02.080 --> 01:44:08.240]  literature a good fine example of good writing but that's not all the bibles you see these days
[01:44:08.240 --> 01:44:14.400]  some of them are pretty wretched well you're absolutely right so so so bottom line is
[01:44:14.400 --> 01:44:19.440]  compromise it's blackmailed regardless of people's political views or social views the point is this
[01:44:19.440 --> 01:44:25.120]  is going on this is happening they're using it to blackmail the white house this is system-wide
[01:44:25.840 --> 01:44:30.240]  and it's it's gotten so bad that as i keep reporting dying corn halliburton can be in
[01:44:30.240 --> 01:44:35.200]  the chicago tribune running child kidnapping rings and no one gets in trouble i mean this is so big
[01:44:35.760 --> 01:44:41.280]  what is their goal i mean you know one child policy breaking up the family society's degenerating
[01:44:41.280 --> 01:44:45.200]  every major organization's been infiltrated or compromised or completely taken over
[01:44:45.840 --> 01:44:51.120]  by these new world order people the average mason is compartmentalized and has never proceeded
[01:44:51.120 --> 01:44:55.440]  outside the porch so they think the masonic order is good and think we're liars they don't know what
[01:44:55.440 --> 01:45:02.000]  it is high level uh it seems like the whole world is in thrall of this devilish system where is it
[01:45:02.000 --> 01:45:08.240]  all going hudin well it's heading straight for the uh the end i don't know how long it's going
[01:45:08.240 --> 01:45:15.040]  to take but unless we can get our church back some way i get i get the government back some
[01:45:15.040 --> 01:45:19.840]  way too as long as we're at it but you're more likely to get it back if you have a bunch of
[01:45:19.840 --> 01:45:28.320]  people who are trained in morals it's not done anymore everything is loose what do you say to
[01:45:28.320 --> 01:45:33.520]  mainstream mainline people that think they're members of the catholic church who go along with
[01:45:33.520 --> 01:45:39.600]  all of this uh i mean it's clear that it was this has been designed to destroy that institution it
[01:45:39.600 --> 01:45:44.000]  has the membership's fallen off it's falling apart but what would you say to those that are still
[01:45:44.000 --> 01:45:48.640]  part of this system what would you say to those who are in denial that i mean i mean when rat
[01:45:48.640 --> 01:45:53.200]  singer's up there saying one world government new world order one world religion i mean it doesn't
[01:45:53.200 --> 01:45:59.360]  get any clearer that's in clear clear english uh he's clearly saying it yeah that's true enough
[01:45:59.360 --> 01:46:04.000]  i mean i don't know how people could deny it's also in clear german and italian whatever else
[01:46:04.000 --> 01:46:10.160]  you can think of it used to come out in latin and then nobody knew what he was talking about
[01:46:13.520 --> 01:46:21.440]  we have to say to those people whom do you follow why you listen to these people
[01:46:23.040 --> 01:46:29.120]  how is it possible that this man is a pope because that's what they do they're infallible
[01:46:29.360 --> 01:46:36.160]  they hold the office and therefore they can do no wrong uh logically or i mean they carry it too far
[01:46:36.880 --> 01:46:46.720]  because his infallibility is limited to the articles of faith and to the morals
[01:46:46.720 --> 01:46:51.440]  that means the implementation of the basic uh foundation the bible the canons
[01:46:52.000 --> 01:46:58.480]  yes and the and whatever the church has taken from tradition from christ and his apostles
[01:46:59.120 --> 01:47:05.120]  tradition is not what comes later well isn't it uh hutton gibson i mean this is really like bank
[01:47:05.120 --> 01:47:09.680]  robbers dressing up like police to go rob the bank and then everybody submits to them and says
[01:47:09.680 --> 01:47:17.840]  well they're wearing the uniform they must be cops yeah well you have to figure there are such
[01:47:17.840 --> 01:47:27.120]  things in the world as oxymorons we have what you could call mutually exclusive concepts
[01:47:27.840 --> 01:47:33.840]  and since these men are on record as promoting heresy they cannot be catholic and if they are
[01:47:33.840 --> 01:47:41.280]  not catholic they cannot be pope we have not had an eligible pope since prize the 12th now there's
[01:47:41.280 --> 01:47:46.720]  a big debate about when the new world order i mean we know it was always in there and doing things
[01:47:46.720 --> 01:47:51.840]  but when the new world order fully took control of the entire catholic apparatchi at least this
[01:47:52.480 --> 01:47:58.160]  more modern masonic version uh and and there's a big debate raging about that from your research
[01:47:58.160 --> 01:48:04.400]  the other scholars you confer with and your trips to rome uh and and your research what
[01:48:04.400 --> 01:48:09.680]  have you discovered when when can you mark the point they really you know had had control
[01:48:11.440 --> 01:48:18.800]  what they did was call this vatican council too for which there was no reason if there were any
[01:48:18.800 --> 01:48:23.440]  reasons there might have been three things that would call for uh something like that and they
[01:48:23.440 --> 01:48:34.400]  did not rule out any one of them and uh one of them was communism one of them was contraception
[01:48:35.120 --> 01:48:40.800]  and one of them was usury and they never said a word on any of these officially
[01:48:44.640 --> 01:48:48.640]  and well what is it going to take for people to figure out that rat singer's pure evil is
[01:48:48.640 --> 01:48:52.080]  he gonna have to dress up in a devil outfit and dance around with a pitchfork
[01:48:52.080 --> 01:48:55.120]  i don't think that'll do it people do things like that all the time
[01:48:57.760 --> 01:49:02.000]  oh man i just well i mean that's the equivalent calling for one world government one world
[01:49:02.000 --> 01:49:09.440]  religion but of course it as uh he should make a point with catholics that the man is not a bishop
[01:49:09.440 --> 01:49:16.960]  and there he is his office is bishop of rome and he's not a bishop because he went through a
[01:49:16.960 --> 01:49:22.800]  ceremony which would never make anyone a bishop which was brought in at the same time this new
[01:49:22.800 --> 01:49:30.000]  mass was brought in in 1969 so basically there was a hostile takeover they'd already infiltrated
[01:49:30.000 --> 01:49:36.640]  long before there was a hostile takeover in 69 that's the key day well that that was pretty
[01:49:36.640 --> 01:49:42.400]  conclusive at that point where they put us all any any priest that would look at that new mass
[01:49:43.200 --> 01:49:52.240]  and say this is a mass would have to deny all this education and the oaths that he took up
[01:49:52.240 --> 01:49:57.040]  on ordination hudson gibson i'm looking at a southern poverty law center quote intelligence
[01:49:57.040 --> 01:50:04.880]  report radical powerhouse the society of saint pius v or is that the 10th uh which has
[01:50:04.880 --> 01:50:09.200]  chapels and schools across the united states remains a front and it goes in to say it's
[01:50:09.440 --> 01:50:14.880]  basically evil nazis if you don't submit to what the mainline church says you're a nazi
[01:50:14.880 --> 01:50:18.320]  do you have comments on i mean they're really getting bold when they're attacking
[01:50:18.320 --> 01:50:21.440]  the traditionalist catholic movement that's got tens of millions of members
[01:50:22.640 --> 01:50:30.800]  well they're trying to isolate us uh put us into this right wing corner i've often wondered how
[01:50:30.800 --> 01:50:35.920]  i got out on this right wing because i grew up right in the center of the church and without
[01:50:35.920 --> 01:50:41.440]  a change of attitude belief practice suddenly i'm out here on this right wing
[01:50:42.880 --> 01:50:45.520]  and who's demonstrating this is a right wing
[01:50:47.360 --> 01:50:52.080]  all i'm doing is exactly what my ancestors did right back to the time of saint patrick
[01:50:53.520 --> 01:50:57.440]  but it seems more and more hutton that the establishment is losing control the alternative
[01:50:57.440 --> 01:51:02.640]  media is exploding alternative films are exploding it does seem that the pendulum is starting to
[01:51:02.640 --> 01:51:07.520]  swing back things are getting bad but it does seem like people are waking up are are are you
[01:51:07.520 --> 01:51:15.600]  saying that well i hope they're waking up i'm trying to help wake them up by talking in public
[01:51:15.600 --> 01:51:24.000]  for a change i've been neglecting my duty because of the uh see there's certain people that are
[01:51:24.000 --> 01:51:29.360]  they don't give a damn what i think they're out after my son now we understand that well

[01:56:46.320 --> 01:56:53.040]  i guess you call it or they uh they used to call it mccarthyism well he does written out
[01:56:53.040 --> 01:56:56.640]  i mean mel does stick up for his dad and and he says that you're his biggest hero
[01:56:57.680 --> 01:57:03.360]  well that's very gratifying i hadn't heard that one no yeah yeah he uh i've seen it in a tv
[01:57:03.360 --> 01:57:07.840]  interview but but you know i tell you uh that they did take out of context what you said they
[01:57:07.840 --> 01:57:12.000]  did lie about what you said they did all sorts of things i got called by internet by national
[01:57:12.000 --> 01:57:17.600]  television wanting to buy an interview you did here and i just told them uh you know where they
[01:57:17.600 --> 01:57:23.120]  could go uh so they could try to craft some things and i just it's just despicable but again like i
[01:57:23.120 --> 01:57:30.240]  said people are waking up to this they're not buying it anymore hutton i hope not but uh
[01:57:31.120 --> 01:57:37.920]  you mentioned a southern poverty law center yes isn't that that outfit that uh chased the
[01:57:37.920 --> 01:57:43.920]  ten commandments out of the alabama state court yes that's that's what they do they're here to
[01:57:43.920 --> 01:57:51.920]  here to destroy the country and then bush didn't even stand up for judge loy moore he sent a
[01:57:52.800 --> 01:57:54.000]  prosecutor down after him
[01:57:57.520 --> 01:58:04.480]  what do you expect uh isn't this the guy that all he's against abortion and then he says
[01:58:04.480 --> 01:58:09.920]  well give me a bill i'll sign it he doesn't need a bill he got this star gone home secure
[01:58:09.920 --> 01:58:15.680]  homeland security thing through there because he wanted it well remember three years ago you were
[01:58:15.680 --> 01:58:19.440]  on right when the passion of christ was about to come out and you told me about the diane
[01:58:19.440 --> 01:58:24.560]  sawyer interview before it even went on tv that mel said you know where the wm guess where i'm
[01:58:24.560 --> 01:58:29.840]  going to hide out after this movie comes out i'm going to hide where the wmds are hidden right

[01:58:35.600 --> 01:58:42.400]  talk of attacking iran well they'll get to it they don't throw these things up it's it's a balloon
[01:58:42.400 --> 01:58:49.200]  and then you you get uh talked into it people discover things that have happened like uh
[01:58:50.000 --> 01:58:57.600]  well maybe 500 years ago they saw persia uh shot a christian or something if he had a gun

[02:00:55.280 --> 02:01:00.960]  the illuminati the masons their occultic activities and i mean even keith uberman's
[02:01:00.960 --> 02:01:08.880]  gone on national tv and said bush is engaging in human sacrifice over uh in iraq we're going to
[02:01:08.880 --> 02:01:12.320]  play that clip and i was talking to one of the anthropologists who lives here in austin a friend
[02:01:12.320 --> 02:01:16.720]  of mine who's also a fan of the show who was one of the anthropologists on apocalypto and
[02:01:17.600 --> 02:01:22.080]  she was talking about how and mel's actually said it publicly too in some interviews but
[02:01:22.080 --> 02:01:26.640]  on the set he was talking about how you know this is this is human sacrifice but now even
[02:01:26.640 --> 02:01:32.640]  keith uberman's saying it uh do you agree with that hutton that i mean this is a weird form of
[02:01:32.640 --> 02:01:36.560]  human sacrifice over there absolutely we have no business there
[02:01:38.400 --> 02:01:43.440]  but i mean bush says we must have more sacrifice well yeah well let's uh
[02:01:43.440 --> 02:01:52.720]  uh i i would appreciate it more if he had been uh right there in the army when they wanted him
[02:01:52.720 --> 02:01:57.280]  in the air force wherever he was supposed to be or if his daughters were enlisting right now
[02:01:57.280 --> 02:02:02.160]  yeah that would help or some other members of his family what are you going to do if they try
[02:02:02.160 --> 02:02:06.480]  to reinstitute the draft i mean you you left the usu said pretty much because of that in the late
[02:02:06.480 --> 02:02:14.160]  60s and what have you what's the family planning if they uh if they try to draft now with all those
[02:02:14.160 --> 02:02:24.000]  grandkids well to start with 28 of them are in australia they can't get after that uh
[02:02:25.440 --> 02:02:32.400]  it's anybody's guess hutton in closing anything else you want to add and why did you decide to
[02:02:32.400 --> 02:02:38.640]  after two and a half years of silence um i guess the last time i interviewed you on air you were
[02:02:38.640 --> 02:02:46.080]  about 86 now you're 88 uh why are you now deciding to go public again well i'm shirking my duty i've
[02:02:46.080 --> 02:02:52.640]  got to get this tough out about the church and uh it doesn't make any difference to what else
[02:02:52.640 --> 02:02:58.560]  i'm supposed to have said or thought uh we got the thought police going of course
[02:02:58.560 --> 02:03:04.640]  they've got all this hate crimes legislation they're trying to pass for a strict free speech
[02:03:04.640 --> 02:03:07.280]  oh yeah free thought too
[02:03:11.520 --> 02:03:20.800]  but for instance now our our friendly rotsinger has decided that he will give us his kind loving
[02:03:20.800 --> 02:03:29.680]  permission to have the mass back but he's not doing that he's giving us a 1962 change of john
[02:03:29.680 --> 02:03:36.880]  23rd so basically but again that shows they're at least trying to camouflage what they're doing a
[02:03:36.880 --> 02:03:42.720]  little bit more that shows that the traditionalist movement uh or is called the orthodox movement is
[02:03:42.720 --> 02:03:47.680]  exploding i mean is it not well they're trying to break it up you see some people will settle for
[02:03:47.680 --> 02:03:55.120]  just the mass i won't i want the whole church back well they won't have the mass anyway because
[02:03:55.120 --> 02:04:01.680]  they have nobody that can say it well the priest ordains suppose at least in 69 are not priests
[02:04:01.680 --> 02:04:05.920]  and what they would then participate in if it weren't right in the right already
[02:04:05.920 --> 02:04:12.320]  is idolatry well huntin you've done amazing work with others towards exposing this takeover in this
[02:04:12.400 --> 02:04:18.000]  evil and it does show that individuals highly motivated can have an effect and uh you have
[02:04:18.000 --> 02:04:22.640]  had a life well lived and are still doing wonderful work and uh i know you're gonna be
[02:04:22.640 --> 02:04:27.200]  around with us for a long time to come my friend and i i hope we can avert an attack on iran and
[02:04:27.200 --> 02:04:30.640]  a draft and the rest of it but i think if they try that it's going to be the beginning of the
[02:04:30.640 --> 02:04:39.360]  end form i think they can push too far yeah well they'll they'll push too far because they're after
[02:04:39.360 --> 02:04:47.920]  a certain thing homogenization everybody's got to be the same otherwise we won't make good slaves
[02:04:49.040 --> 02:04:55.360]  that goes in the church especially so if we get the church back we have a chance at the
[02:04:55.360 --> 02:04:58.080]  other i don't know who what chance we have with the government
[02:05:00.320 --> 02:05:04.000]  but i'm working as well as i can on the church you keep it up

[02:16:21.920 --> 02:16:26.800]  and because now we got the numbers in since the first wave of the surge uh we have record troops
[02:16:26.800 --> 02:16:30.960]  dying 27 in one weekend and that's continuing through the week right now so we're talking about
[02:16:30.960 --> 02:16:37.440]  24 in one day so here's keith overman then we'll continue tonight a special comment about sacrifice
[02:16:37.440 --> 02:16:42.160]  if in your presence an individual tried to sacrifice an american serviceman or woman would
[02:16:42.160 --> 02:16:48.720]  you intervene would you at least protest what if he had already sacrificed 3003 of them what if he
[02:16:48.720 --> 02:16:54.240]  had already sacrificed 3003 of them and was then to announce his intention to sacrifice hundreds
[02:16:54.240 --> 02:16:59.520]  maybe thousands more this is where we stand tonight with the bbc report of president bush's
[02:16:59.520 --> 02:17:05.120]  quote new iraq strategy unquote and his impending speech to the nation which it quotes a senior
[02:17:05.120 --> 02:17:11.600]  american official is saying will be about troop increases and sacrifice the president has delayed
[02:17:11.600 --> 02:17:16.720]  dawdled deferred for the month since the release of the iraq study group he has seemingly heard
[02:17:16.720 --> 02:17:22.240]  out everybody and listened to none of them if the bbc is right and we can only pray it is not
[02:17:22.800 --> 02:17:27.520]  he has settled on the only solution all the true experts agree cannot possibly work
[02:17:27.520 --> 02:17:33.920]  more american personnel in iraq not as trainers for iraqi troops but as part of some flabby
[02:17:33.920 --> 02:17:41.040]  ill-defined plan for sacrifice sacrifice more american servicemen and women will have their
[02:17:41.040 --> 02:17:46.880]  lives risked more american servicemen and women will have their lives ended more american families
[02:17:46.880 --> 02:17:54.000]  will have to bear the unbearable and rationalize the unforgivable sacrifice sacrifice now sacrifice
[02:17:54.000 --> 02:18:00.400]  tomorrow sacrifice forever and more americans more even than the two-thirds who already believe we
[02:18:00.400 --> 02:18:05.520]  need fewer troops in iraq and not more we'll have to conclude this president does not have
[02:18:05.520 --> 02:18:12.080]  any idea what he's doing and that other americans will have to die for that reason it must now be
[02:18:12.080 --> 02:18:16.960]  branded as propaganda for even the president cannot truly feel that very many people still
[02:18:16.960 --> 02:18:22.640]  believe him to be competent in this area let alone the decider but from our impeccable reporter at
[02:18:22.640 --> 02:18:27.920]  the pentagon jim mikloshevsky tonight comes confirmation of something called surge and
[02:18:27.920 --> 02:18:35.040]  accelerate as many as 20 000 additional troops for political purposes this in line with what we had
[02:18:35.040 --> 02:18:40.080]  previously heard that this will be proclaimed a short-term measure for the stated purpose of
[02:18:40.080 --> 02:18:45.760]  increasing security in and around baghdad and giving an iraqi government a chance to establish
[02:18:45.760 --> 02:18:52.800]  some kind of order this is palpable nonsense mr bush if this is your intention if the centerpiece
[02:18:52.800 --> 02:18:59.280]  of your announcement next week will be sacrifice sacrifice your intention not more american lives
[02:18:59.280 --> 02:19:05.920]  as senator biden of delaware has pointed out the new troops might improve the ratio our forces face
[02:19:05.920 --> 02:19:15.280]  relative to those living in baghdad friend and foe from 200 to 1 to just 100 to 1 sacrifice no drop
[02:19:15.280 --> 02:19:20.880]  in a bucket the additional men and women you have sentenced to go there sir will serve only as
[02:19:20.880 --> 02:19:26.960]  targets they will not be their short term mr bush for many it will mean a year or more in death's
[02:19:26.960 --> 02:19:32.960]  shadow this is not temporary mr bush for the americans who will die because of you it will be
[02:19:32.960 --> 02:19:40.400]  as permanent as it gets the various rationales for what mr bush will reportedly rechristen sacrifice
[02:19:40.400 --> 02:19:46.320]  constitute a very thin gruel indeed the former labor secretary robert like says senator mccain
[02:19:46.320 --> 02:19:52.400]  told him that the surge would help the morale of the troops already in iraq if mr mccain truly said
[02:19:52.400 --> 02:19:57.920]  that and truly believes it he has either forgotten completely his own experience in vietnam or he is
[02:19:57.920 --> 02:20:04.400]  unaware of the recent military times poll indicating only 38 of our active military want to see more
[02:20:04.400 --> 02:20:10.320]  troops sent to iraq all that or mr mccain has departed from reality then there is the argument
[02:20:10.320 --> 02:20:14.640]  that to take any steps towards reducing troop numbers would show weakness to the enemy when we
[02:20:14.640 --> 02:20:18.880]  get back at the end he calls it human sacrifice and i'll play another clip and we'll cover a bunch

[02:24:55.600 --> 02:25:01.920]  and things like a 10-minute clip i'm just going to have john find the part he has to watch it
[02:25:03.920 --> 02:25:08.080]  and as soon as he finds it just the part where he talks about this is all human sacrifice
[02:25:08.720 --> 02:25:11.680]  because i just want to play that part of the clip you can go online just type keith

[02:25:17.840 --> 02:25:21.840]  but uh i mean it really boils it all down this is human sacrifice
[02:25:21.840 --> 02:25:31.280]  the next clip i want to play cuts in this is in the middle of uh rant of the uh two-part series
[02:25:31.280 --> 02:25:36.160]  we just put up a prison planet tv members and this cuts into me talking about staged wars between
[02:25:36.160 --> 02:25:41.760]  cousins in france and england where i'm there in london england beneath a big war memorial
[02:25:42.640 --> 02:25:48.160]  and talking about sacrifice and how it's human sacrifice and the goddess looks down on the big
[02:25:49.360 --> 02:25:56.080]  war memorial for 44 000 dead artillery troops in world war one it says the sacrifice the
[02:25:56.080 --> 02:26:03.520]  brotherhood of death and then all over london it anywhere you see a goddess you'll be driving and
[02:26:03.600 --> 02:26:07.360]  see a big goddess you'll go i know there'll be a memorial right beneath her she's looking at
[02:26:07.920 --> 02:26:14.640]  and it's the same thing in canada same thing in the u.s it is religious and they believe and they
[02:26:14.640 --> 02:26:20.480]  it'll even say order of death or the glorious death it'll say a variant of that beneath them
[02:26:20.480 --> 02:26:28.960]  well here's the audio do you have that clip uh john from when uh i was uh
[02:26:29.760 --> 02:26:34.080]  out there do you are are you feeding that to me or i just can't hear it okay here it is
[02:26:35.040 --> 02:26:38.960]  saying our cousin it's time for a war i've got some rabble causing a problem
[02:26:39.600 --> 02:26:44.080]  these with him immediately oh yes but that's a flip of a wall in holy land
[02:26:45.120 --> 02:26:49.520]  the last time i took some of your some of your areas i'll be i'll be taking britainy back
[02:26:49.520 --> 02:26:55.360]  well there we have it we've had it for 25 years it's your turn now well down there this is how
[02:26:56.000 --> 02:27:02.880]  this is out worse and then all of their all of their occultism there with the goddess she's
[02:27:02.880 --> 02:27:10.320]  staring down on her sacrifice 46,000 dead just from the artillery corps in world war one and
[02:27:10.320 --> 02:27:21.520]  look a royal fellowship and over here of death a royal fellowship of death and she stares down
[02:27:21.520 --> 02:27:27.520]  all over the western world you will see the goddess staring down on memorials that are
[02:27:27.520 --> 02:27:34.160]  literally built to her as sacrifices and right here skull and bones order of death order the
[02:27:34.160 --> 02:27:41.520]  death said the nazis the royal fellowship of death and everywhere the glorious dead
[02:27:41.520 --> 02:27:47.600]  the glorious slaughter the glorious bloodletting that the goddess demands
[02:27:47.680 --> 02:27:54.240]  see here's the illuminati language hidden in plain view right in your face
[02:27:59.040 --> 02:28:06.640]  look at this statue of achilles just more of the open mystery religion occultism
[02:28:06.640 --> 02:28:14.480]  of the city of london another war memorial this time cast according to a greek hero or greek
[02:28:15.120 --> 02:28:15.760]  jimmy god
[02:28:21.360 --> 02:28:26.320]  well this is a commonwealth nation still part of the united kingdom really and we've got this
[02:28:26.320 --> 02:28:30.720]  world war one world war ii memorial it's very beautiful but it's also very occultic and just
[02:28:30.720 --> 02:28:35.280]  as it is in london and all over the world where you have commonwealth nations you've got the
[02:28:35.280 --> 02:28:40.720]  goddess actually two goddesses with the torch up there and then the wreath of victory over the
[02:28:41.600 --> 02:28:47.520]  victorious soldiers marching through a triumphant arch every facet of this is occultic
[02:28:55.280 --> 02:29:05.520]  there is massive symbolism here you have a star you have two twin pillars with obelisk points
[02:29:05.520 --> 02:29:19.040]  pointing downwards to the east this yeah this entire thing is is just unbelievably occulting
[02:29:19.600 --> 02:29:25.360]  every facet of the layout again most people who walk past this have no idea what they're even
[02:29:25.360 --> 02:29:32.880]  looking at
[02:29:36.480 --> 02:29:39.760]  i'm not going to have the texas is the lonestar state that's the capital which

[02:30:15.440 --> 02:30:18.000]  she's up there holding a pentagram in her hand on top of the capital

[02:33:44.800 --> 02:33:51.680]  also have to have not just a passport but the federal government has to decide if you can
[02:33:51.680 --> 02:33:58.000]  enter or leave even if you're a u.s citizen uh this is this has never before happened in the
[02:33:58.000 --> 02:34:01.920]  u.s the soviet union and only a few other countries had laws like this i mean obviously

[02:34:32.640 --> 02:34:39.040]  a frog they'll probably go ahead and just attack them we're getting a very very close to all of
[02:34:39.040 --> 02:34:47.520]  this uh just uh boiling over also in africa reuters reports south africa urge to isolate
[02:34:47.520 --> 02:34:53.120]  killer tb patients hey do you like the u.s does we have killer tb and drug resistant drug immune
[02:34:53.120 --> 02:34:57.680]  everywhere then they just put the kids with it right next to the other kids in the classes and
[02:34:57.680 --> 02:35:02.560]  nothing happens but then they push all sorts of bizarre deadly mercury-filled vaccines on the
[02:35:02.560 --> 02:35:10.880]  kids and try to make girls take uh stuff for um cancer cancer vaccines for cervical cancer caused
[02:35:10.880 --> 02:35:17.840]  by a virus it's just it's just so crazy so we'll uh get into that also house may attach section 220
[02:35:17.840 --> 02:35:22.000]  to its lobbying ethics bill that's the one that will make anybody who has a blog or a website
[02:35:22.000 --> 02:35:26.800]  or a posting site with over 500 visitors a year register as a lobbyist and be under federal law
[02:35:26.800 --> 02:35:32.960]  no free speech basically millions could see taxes up and bush's new health plan i'm going to mention
[02:35:32.960 --> 02:35:37.840]  all of this an 81 year old pennsylvania man got a visit from the secret service for saying something
[02:35:38.800 --> 02:35:43.600]  vaguely mean towards the president black caucus says no whites allowed i guess that's why it's
[02:35:43.600 --> 02:35:51.120]  the black caucus and uh united states and the un drafts holocaust denial resolution
[02:35:52.640 --> 02:35:59.040]  and again folks it's about free speech you can say 10 billion people died or millions died and
[02:35:59.040 --> 02:36:03.360]  we know that there's a lot of people the point is if somebody wants to say he was a nice person
[02:36:03.360 --> 02:36:09.920]  that's their right to do it so we'll we'll uh break that down as well because folks they're
[02:36:09.920 --> 02:36:13.840]  not really wanting to take the nazis free speech they're wanting to take our free speech the ones
[02:36:13.840 --> 02:36:18.640]  that people who are against the wars free speech free either everybody's got free speech or none
[02:36:18.640 --> 02:36:24.240]  of us have it marty shachter shachton hadn't been on with us in a few weeks and i just love him to
[02:36:24.240 --> 02:36:32.080]  death and i wanted to get him back up uh he's got the five-star soap it was organic back before they
[02:36:32.080 --> 02:36:37.520]  even had to call it organic but he's certified by the state of california and it's uh no animal
[02:36:37.520 --> 02:36:44.880]  products uh no uh tallow it's just vegetable and fruit oils and extracts and it's what we use in
[02:36:44.880 --> 02:36:51.280]  my home it's what my staff uses listeners have gotten a little uh sampler pack what is it like
[02:36:51.280 --> 02:36:56.320]  17 bucks that's got to sample everything they make where you can get a six-month year supply
[02:36:56.320 --> 02:37:03.840]  two-year supply you'll save 85 off supermarket prices and with their monopoly going the oligopoly
[02:37:03.840 --> 02:37:07.840]  going the cartel going with the big chemical companies they make your soap chemicals it's
[02:37:07.840 --> 02:37:14.000]  not really so it's not soap for your clothes it's detergents that eat them and uh because you get
[02:37:14.000 --> 02:37:18.640]  direct from the manufacturer three generations marty's father started his son now works with him
[02:37:19.360 --> 02:37:21.840]  they've been around for what is it 60 years
[02:37:23.040 --> 02:37:32.960]  since 1947 and they're out in oakland california and uh folks bath soap hair soap dishwasher soap
[02:37:36.000 --> 02:37:42.400]  clothes washing soap creams lotions bar soap is the best with that cherry oil and
[02:37:43.120 --> 02:37:48.400]  or almond oil just smells so good and again you leave chemical soap detergent under your arms you
[02:37:48.400 --> 02:37:52.720]  get burned with just a drop or two this stuff you leave a little bit on you by accident nothing
[02:37:52.720 --> 02:37:58.720]  happens because it's soap marty good to talk to you my friend pleasure talking to you about
[02:37:58.720 --> 02:38:05.680]  homelands cleanliness that's right we all need to be clean in the new homeland system uh tell folks
[02:38:05.680 --> 02:38:10.720]  why yourself is so good and why they need to call and get a free catalog or call and get the sampler
[02:38:10.720 --> 02:38:15.840]  pack or call and get a year supply well most of the people in our country and this really
[02:38:15.840 --> 02:38:23.040]  aggravates me have been hypnotized brainwashed uh and controlled about the chemicals they're
[02:38:23.040 --> 02:38:30.400]  buying from the supermarket by the major billion dollar corporations like broctor lever and colgate
[02:38:30.400 --> 02:38:38.400]  and we counter that we go direct to the home from our factory with pure soap products not detergents
[02:38:38.400 --> 02:38:43.920]  not caustics that's stuff that burns harms pollutes we don't go for that we don't need
[02:38:43.920 --> 02:38:52.880]  that perfumes so-called fragrances are very toxic and it's a constant war with the chemical companies
[02:38:52.880 --> 02:38:59.520]  who's got the newest smell the newest fragrance the newest perfume well those are all harmful
[02:38:59.520 --> 02:39:06.320]  we don't use that we use natural juices from almonds from cherries from lemons
[02:39:06.800 --> 02:39:15.200]  uh all these things that are harmless give a nice smell but don't hurt harm or burn or pollute
[02:39:15.200 --> 02:39:22.800]  this is the difference between buying all-natural pure soaps from us factory direct save money
[02:39:22.800 --> 02:39:29.440]  save the environment save your skin we make it we we've been doing it now and this is the 60th

[02:43:52.400 --> 02:43:59.920]  the news here us warns iran to back down associated press a second us aircraft carrier
[02:43:59.920 --> 02:44:05.280]  strike group uh there's four of them the foreign press reports four but it's those many carriers
[02:44:05.280 --> 02:44:11.520]  so i guess it doesn't count there's there's four task forces okay but two of the super carriers
[02:44:13.120 --> 02:44:16.880]  a second us aircraft carrier strike group now steaming towards the middle east is
[02:44:16.880 --> 02:44:21.440]  washington's way of warning iran to back down in its attempts to dominate the region atop
[02:44:21.440 --> 02:44:28.880]  u.s diplomats said here today nicholas burns u.s undersecretary of the state for political
[02:44:28.880 --> 02:44:34.400]  affairs ruled out direct negotiations with iran and said a reapproachment between washington and
[02:44:34.400 --> 02:44:41.120]  iran was not possible until iran halts uranium enrichment the middle east isn't a region to be
[02:44:41.120 --> 02:44:46.160]  dominated by iran the gulf is in a body of water to be controlled by iran that's why we've seen
[02:44:46.160 --> 02:44:50.880]  the united states station two aircraft carrier battle groups in the region burn set an address
[02:44:50.880 --> 02:44:58.560]  to the dubai-based gulf region center and the bbc and the korean times reported on sunday that there
[02:44:58.560 --> 02:45:03.280]  is a massive strike on hundreds of sites and on their navy and on their missile forces and their
[02:45:03.280 --> 02:45:08.240]  conventional forces and even a possible invasion into the west where most of their oil just so
[02:45:08.240 --> 02:45:15.600]  happens to be in that couple hundred mile swath there along the eastern border of iraq western
[02:45:15.600 --> 02:45:24.480]  border of iran bordering each other continuing here millions could see taxes up in bush health
[02:45:24.480 --> 02:45:30.240]  plan and what is bush doing to give people universal health care which is what the big
[02:45:30.240 --> 02:45:36.720]  banks want to control all of us it sounds great to give everybody health care but it gives them
[02:45:36.720 --> 02:45:44.960]  control of health care it socializes it about 30 million americans could face a tax hike under
[02:45:44.960 --> 02:45:50.640]  president george w bush's plan and i've looked at watchdog ribs they're saying more like 50 million
[02:45:50.640 --> 02:46:00.480]  americans and it says here that they plan to tax later they admit 47 million people
[02:46:01.760 --> 02:46:07.840]  they want to give health insurance by taxing 50 million people and it says that they're going to
[02:46:07.840 --> 02:46:22.560]  tax our insurance premiums and it says here that anyone who has employer provided plans
[02:46:24.480 --> 02:46:31.120]  and that's that's me i've uh i'm one of the few talks is actually an employee of genesis
[02:46:31.120 --> 02:46:36.560]  and i've had i guess for six years health insurance with them oh there'll be a tax
[02:46:37.840 --> 02:46:39.360]  it says a hefty one
[02:46:42.080 --> 02:46:50.640]  of 15 000 for an average size family's insurance so the president is proposing
[02:46:53.520 --> 02:46:54.480]  this is incredible
[02:46:56.960 --> 02:47:06.240]  so they're talking about taxing some people's insurance policies and then giving tax deductions
[02:47:06.960 --> 02:47:13.120]  for families to get insurance so you got to love that talk about a deal for the insurance companies
[02:47:13.120 --> 02:47:20.880]  bush is going to take one group's money and give it to another group to then buy insurance from
[02:47:20.880 --> 02:47:26.160]  the same insurance companies that is just incredible i'm babbling through this a bit
[02:47:26.160 --> 02:47:30.320]  sometimes we don't print these in printer friendly and it cut off the last two words of each line i'm
[02:47:30.880 --> 02:47:39.040]  trying to decipher this again bush is proposing to make health insurance premiums taxable income with
[02:47:39.040 --> 02:47:50.320]  peoples who have employer program plans a tax hike this is and it says he's going to talk about this
[02:47:50.320 --> 02:47:57.440]  in the state of the union tonight so i guess we'll hear it directly from the horse's mouth
[02:47:57.440 --> 02:48:02.560]  oh going back to that keith overman thing where he's um taught that there's a problem with keith
[02:48:02.560 --> 02:48:07.520]  overman though he's implying that bush is listening to no one bush is an idiot bush is running
[02:48:07.520 --> 02:48:13.440]  everything uh the policy doesn't make sense oh my gosh it's bush it's bush bush runs nothing james
[02:48:13.440 --> 02:48:19.360]  baker and henry kissinger and those guys are the rockefeller rothchild agents what the roman
[02:48:19.360 --> 02:48:24.720]  emperors had that individual their legates that could go around acting as the uh as the emperor
[02:48:24.720 --> 02:48:30.160]  and his voice well that's who uh people like bazigni brazinski he's definitely a legate of
[02:48:30.160 --> 02:48:38.800]  the new world order uh james baker george schultz no doubt henry kissinger are legates and they go
[02:48:38.800 --> 02:48:45.120]  around they share almost every commission i was down in galveston on vacation at the beach picked
[02:48:45.120 --> 02:48:51.040]  up a local galveston paper and it was james baker the third shares a look at the bp chemical plant
[02:48:51.040 --> 02:48:56.560]  explosion that killed a bunch of people and he you know went on to basically he was whitewashing
[02:48:56.560 --> 02:49:00.240]  the whole thing it's just like every commission there is it seems one of these creatures is on
[02:49:00.240 --> 02:49:05.360]  it whitewashing it said he's gotten tough on him and he read it and he did nothing to him
[02:49:06.720 --> 02:49:10.480]  i mean it just never ends by the way did you ever find that part in the 10 minute club of overman
[02:49:11.680 --> 02:49:16.720]  yeah here's the part where he talked specifically about how bush is engaging in human sacrifice
[02:49:16.720 --> 02:49:21.040]  see still though the illusion that bush is running something or that barack obama or
[02:49:21.040 --> 02:49:26.880]  hillary will run something they're total puppets here it is no sir this is not sacrifice this has
[02:49:26.880 --> 02:49:35.360]  now become human sacrifice and it must stop and you can stop it next week make us all look wrong
[02:49:36.000 --> 02:49:41.760]  our meaningless sacrifice in iraq must stop and you sir must stop it
[02:49:42.720 --> 02:49:45.360]  from washington i'm keith overman good night and good luck
[02:49:47.040 --> 02:49:51.600]  as i've been saying for years it's human sacrifice as hutton gibson said last hour
[02:49:51.600 --> 02:49:57.280]  as mel gibson has said i mean anybody who's got half a brain knows this house may attach section
[02:49:57.280 --> 02:50:03.600]  220 to its lobbying ethics bills from ted pike uh section 220 that was introduced and had passed
[02:50:03.600 --> 02:50:08.880]  out of committee was shot down late last week it would make all bloggers registered by all i mean
[02:50:08.880 --> 02:50:14.240]  almost everybody's getting 500 visitors a year folks i mean the smallest myspace with 15 friends
[02:50:14.240 --> 02:50:19.840]  is getting that in a month much less a year i mean go look at little bitty myspace accounts
[02:50:19.840 --> 02:50:24.880]  with just a few members and they're a few months old it'll say you know 700 page views you know
[02:50:24.880 --> 02:50:30.000]  that's that's that's pretty much 500 visitors right there uh and be under all these laws and
[02:50:30.000 --> 02:50:35.200]  have to report and be restricted on what you can say or do i mean that's not america well last week
[02:50:35.200 --> 02:50:39.840]  the massive uh calling by the religious and political right made the difference in stripping
[02:50:39.840 --> 02:50:47.520]  freedom threatening legislation from the senate's lobbying reform bill s1 section 220 but now they
[02:50:47.520 --> 02:50:56.240]  are tacking it on to the hate crimes law and they're talking about then reattaching it to
[02:50:56.240 --> 02:51:02.160]  another lobbying bill if they bring it back so they're just coming at us from every conceivable
[02:51:02.160 --> 02:51:09.920]  angle when we get back got a passport travel rules tighten today january 23rd it's supposed
[02:51:09.920 --> 02:51:14.320]  to be january 7th but they're doing it late they're behind don't worry though you'll get your
