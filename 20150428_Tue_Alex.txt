[00:00.000 --> 00:12.040]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[00:12.040 --> 00:22.080]  he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones
[00:22.080 --> 00:29.000]  Stephanie Rawlings Blake the mayor of Baltimore Maryland couldn't be more
[00:29.000 --> 00:33.160]  transparent back when the rioting started the looting in a few days ago
[00:33.160 --> 00:37.680]  they didn't call it rioting or looting they called it protesting so did CNN MSNBC
[00:37.680 --> 00:44.560]  and the usual suspects like Al Sharpton now she's come out and declared a state
[00:44.560 --> 00:48.400]  of emergency but before she did that she said well we decided to give people an
[00:48.400 --> 00:54.280]  area to vent their anger and to basically loot now the National Guard have
[00:54.280 --> 00:58.500]  been called out what were we just saying a month ago about Jade Helm the
[00:58.500 --> 01:03.560]  White House tried to trigger race riots in the targeting of police racially last
[01:03.560 --> 01:07.740]  summer they have sent operatives from the Justice Department in with the
[01:07.740 --> 01:15.360]  Trayvon Martin situation with the Brown situation in Ferguson it's gone over the
[01:15.360 --> 01:20.920]  top this time clearly they want to make the issue about race and infighting
[01:20.920 --> 01:26.440]  while the globalist steal our basic liberties on every front this is the
[01:26.440 --> 01:30.120]  big political distraction Obama couldn't deliver jobs he couldn't deliver
[01:30.120 --> 01:34.440]  anything to the black community but double unemployment in the last seven
[01:34.440 --> 01:40.560]  years of his reign but the social engineers believe they can boost that
[01:40.560 --> 01:49.160]  13% voting block that votes about 90% Democratic Party by invoking massive
[01:49.160 --> 01:54.000]  racial division I know that you as an audience understand this and it's very
[01:54.000 --> 02:00.400]  transparent but for the general public they still don't quite get what's
[02:00.400 --> 02:07.160]  happening here we also have the police being ordered to stand down but being
[02:07.160 --> 02:11.880]  ordered to target even mainstream journalists like CBS news crews the
[02:11.880 --> 02:18.720]  Associated Press on video brutally beating innocent people so this is an
[02:18.720 --> 02:23.960]  engineered operation the police shamefully have followed illegal orders to
[02:23.960 --> 02:28.640]  not stop rioters and looters and people engaged in racial attacks and now they're
[02:28.640 --> 02:34.720]  following their evil orders to attack journalists and quite frankly we saw
[02:34.720 --> 02:41.440]  this in Ferguson where Joe Biggs was shot with rubber bullets doing nothing
[02:41.440 --> 02:49.200]  purposefully Jacarie Jackson was attacked BBC Al Jazeera vice was attacked
[02:49.200 --> 02:52.080]  didn't matter if you were a black reporter a white reporter an Arab
[02:52.080 --> 02:55.680]  reporter a British reporter you were being chased down and hunted and beaten
[02:55.680 --> 03:01.960]  and shot and I don't want to be enemies with the police you're being played
[03:01.960 --> 03:07.240]  like idiots and the looters and rioters of course are the biggest idiots of them
[03:07.240 --> 03:12.160]  all some of the police said we know what's going on we appreciate you others
[03:12.160 --> 03:15.920]  would say get out of there with that camera I'll crack your head open just
[03:15.920 --> 03:21.760]  total idiots but they're getting cops from the pool that is the American
[03:21.760 --> 03:26.320]  people and let's just say it America's still a great country has the greatest
[03:26.320 --> 03:32.480]  accomplishments in history but we fall in a long way and the police reflect the
[03:32.480 --> 03:38.960]  pile of steaming decadent thug life thug culture crud that America's become and
[03:38.960 --> 03:42.600]  by the way we got black thugs we got Hispanic thugs we got Asian thugs we
[03:42.600 --> 03:46.840]  got white thugs they've now got a talking point on MSNBC and CNN we've got
[03:46.840 --> 03:50.760]  the clips coming up that if you call these looters and rioters thugs it's
[03:50.760 --> 03:57.920]  codeword for racism no it's codeword for a bunch of trash and hood rats
[03:57.920 --> 04:02.120]  believe me we got white hood rats around here they're called drag rats that go
[04:02.120 --> 04:05.960]  around robbing people and I don't like black thugs and I don't like white
[04:05.960 --> 04:11.480]  thugs it's real simple and I'm sick of the political correctness it's not gonna
[04:11.480 --> 04:21.800]  work sitting there saying we're racist if we don't like thugs attacking people
[04:21.800 --> 04:25.440]  because of their race and burning buildings and attacking people's cars
[04:25.440 --> 04:29.640]  and beating up Russian reporters because they're white I mean this is just
[04:29.640 --> 04:34.200]  ridiculous the Russians haven't done jack squat to black people and Baltimore is a
[04:34.200 --> 04:38.800]  black run city fact there's the headline it's not just CNN MSNBC saying it the
[04:38.800 --> 04:43.120]  drummer on the tonight show is popping off on TV about it's codeword for the
[04:43.120 --> 04:49.080]  n-word I'm just so sick of it I mean the public is just so dumb down for the
[04:49.080 --> 04:53.800]  most mindless issues we're gonna cover it all Matt Drudge says this could bring
[04:53.800 --> 04:59.200]  down America if we let it it could and that's the plan stay with us as the
[04:59.200 --> 05:03.640]  city of Baltimore struggles to deal with violence and looting I'm reminded of
[05:03.640 --> 05:08.360]  something the mayor recently said it's a very delicate balancing act because
[05:08.360 --> 05:12.360]  while we tried to make sure they were protected from the cars and other things
[05:12.360 --> 05:16.880]  that were going on we also gave those who wish to destroy space to do that as
[05:16.880 --> 05:22.400]  well Mayor Rawlings Blake said in part in other words a stand-down order and I'm
[05:22.400 --> 05:26.600]  very much against using things like tear gas on peaceful demonstrators but to
[05:26.600 --> 05:31.440]  allow people to destroy a part of the city is something else entirely the
[05:31.440 --> 05:35.320]  answer to these situations is not to federalize the police as the Justice
[05:35.320 --> 05:39.720]  Department suggests because remember the m-raps and other armaments these
[05:39.720 --> 05:44.960]  departments get they get from the Pentagon which is to say if federalized
[05:44.960 --> 05:49.000]  police take over you're not going to see less of these armaments you're going to

[08:18.160 --> 08:29.800]  resistance it's Alex Jones well mayor Stephanie Rawlings two days ago had this
[08:29.800 --> 08:38.880]  to say we also gave those who wished to destroy space to do that as well and we
[08:38.880 --> 08:45.720]  worked very hard to to keep that balance and and to put ourselves in the best
[08:45.720 --> 08:52.920]  position to de-escalate and that's what you saw. Anyone who has any basic
[08:52.920 --> 08:57.160]  understanding of sociology anthropology mob psychology I don't care what color
[08:57.160 --> 09:08.640]  the thugs are knows and understands that if you let a bunch of criminal elements
[09:08.640 --> 09:14.080]  most of them that turns out not even from in Maryland but out of DC come in
[09:14.080 --> 09:19.600]  like it's a looting party to burn stuff beat people up and rob electronics and
[09:19.600 --> 09:24.680]  jewelry shops you're going to create an area of lawlessness to allow that to
[09:24.680 --> 09:30.360]  expand notice this stuff always happens in disarmed areas with incredible gun
[09:30.360 --> 09:35.040]  restrictions somebody comes looting down my street I don't care if you're got
[09:35.040 --> 09:40.800]  red hair or you're black or you're Arab or you're Chinese I'm gonna put a bullet
[09:40.800 --> 09:48.000]  in your chest I don't want to kill you but you're not gonna burn my house down
[09:48.000 --> 09:53.280]  and loot it you're not gonna attack me so I'm gonna put a bunch of double lock
[09:53.280 --> 10:00.320]  buck into you and I'm not gonna aim for your legs so you can sue me later so if
[10:00.320 --> 10:06.600]  you're gonna come with guns you better know how to use them I can shoot a clay
[10:06.600 --> 10:12.640]  pigeon at 120 yards not shooting my mouth off but I come from a culture of
[10:12.640 --> 10:17.240]  people that aren't laying down we're not out robin we're not out looting we're
[10:17.240 --> 10:20.840]  building civilization and you want to try to take it down you got to go through
[10:20.840 --> 10:27.320]  me this is a hundred percent George Soros Barack Obama engineered this is the
[10:27.320 --> 10:31.080]  plan to bring down America and I've said there's massive preparations for
[10:31.080 --> 10:35.800]  martial law and tyranny I've never seen in 20 years of broadcast this appears to
[10:35.800 --> 10:40.840]  not be a drill this appears everything we see converging towards a convergence
[10:40.840 --> 10:46.680]  point an event horizon that could be martial law this summer as every major
[10:46.680 --> 10:52.760]  city burns and I have mainline analyst media pundits you name it saying the
[10:52.760 --> 11:00.600]  same thing and notice Jade Helm is lined up right along these times so Obama can
[11:00.600 --> 11:09.300]  come out with some declaration to ban large sectors of types of guns large
[11:09.300 --> 11:14.480]  classes and people are saying well that's crazy it'll cause a civil war that's
[11:14.480 --> 11:19.200]  the plan you're like that'll wreck the country that's the plan that's clowered
[11:19.200 --> 11:26.240]  and piven on steroids the globalist are bold ladies and gentlemen and if they're
[11:26.240 --> 11:29.760]  willing to start a war with Russia and Ukraine they're willing to turn ISIS loose
[11:29.760 --> 11:34.440]  al Qaeda renamed all over the Middle East and overthrow our allies like Egypt
[11:34.440 --> 11:38.920]  and call them heroes on CNN while they're burning every church in the
[11:38.920 --> 11:44.600]  country and crucifying Christians upside down they're willing to pull some
[11:44.600 --> 11:50.600]  hardcore operations now the Egyptians were able to defeat it 20 million people
[11:50.600 --> 11:53.920]  came out in the streets of Cairo and other cities they've now arrested and
[11:53.920 --> 11:57.280]  convicted the people involved they've now released the documents this was our
[11:57.280 --> 12:02.680]  number one ally in the Middle East after Israel showing that Obama's family
[12:02.680 --> 12:09.440]  cousin and others out of Kenya were running the operations so it's bold
[12:09.440 --> 12:16.480]  it's serious it's hardcore and at the end of the day it's gonna hurt black and
[12:16.480 --> 12:21.120]  white and Hispanic and Asian Americans across the board it is divide and
[12:21.120 --> 12:25.960]  conquer let me just give you some of the headlines National Guard called in to
[12:25.960 --> 12:31.720]  keep the peace in Baltimore after they let the fire spread literally and
[12:31.720 --> 12:36.720]  figuratively huge fire set across Baltimore as Freddie Gray rioters
[12:36.720 --> 12:42.880]  torched city looters stores and injured 15 police officers as violence rages
[12:42.880 --> 12:48.600]  into the night and local politicians are left turning on each other I want to
[12:48.600 --> 12:53.400]  play her one more time two days ago saying we gave folks a space to riot in
[12:53.400 --> 12:57.360]  every city in America there are people ready to riot loot and set things on
[12:57.360 --> 13:02.440]  fire excellent article and info wars dot com by Michael Schneider the city of
[13:02.440 --> 13:07.080]  Baltimore has transformed into an absolute warzone close quote Matt drudge
[13:07.080 --> 13:14.400]  on Baltimore riots America could fall kis continues as authorities are accused
[13:14.400 --> 13:18.480]  of failing to deal with unrest Paul Watson as a detailed report and info
[13:18.480 --> 13:23.440]  wars dot com dovetail with that we should probably add to the drudge story mayor
[13:23.440 --> 13:27.440]  ordered police to stand down during Baltimore riots I mean it's the same
[13:27.440 --> 13:32.040]  story over and over again just like the LA riots with the police chief who was
[13:32.040 --> 13:39.920]  later declassified with CIA Daryl Gates now are the cops themselves bad no but
[13:39.920 --> 13:42.720]  they were ordered to stand down and I'm telling you that's why I would never be
[13:42.720 --> 13:47.440]  a cop or I'd get ticked off I mean they told me don't respond to people looting
[13:47.440 --> 13:51.120]  and burning buildings I mean that that's criminal as a citizen if it's
[13:51.120 --> 13:53.880]  happening in front of you not to do something it's failure render aid it's
[13:53.880 --> 13:59.560]  like the leaked border patrol document two months ago that was on CBS news where
[13:59.560 --> 14:06.160]  they said don't respond to crime drunk driving arson if you pull somebody over
[14:06.160 --> 14:10.000]  with drugs or whatever just let them go it's not our job if they're any legal
[14:10.000 --> 14:15.040]  but let me tell you from Arizona to Texas they go in these state parks and
[14:15.040 --> 14:20.640]  national parks and you've got the feds they're writing tickets for college
[14:20.640 --> 14:24.640]  students drinking beer they'll come up to your campsite and go no alcohol out in
[14:24.640 --> 14:29.520]  the park and write tickets for a six-pack occur as light I've seen it with my
[14:29.520 --> 14:34.400]  eyeballs last year and this year in Big Bend then one time I'm sitting there in
[14:34.400 --> 14:40.800]  a natural hot spring and this white but I saw then I saw a black guy act like a
[14:40.800 --> 14:44.800]  total thug in his uniform some of my point is black white that like thugs
[14:44.800 --> 14:49.360]  some of these bad cops there was armed you know national park ranger he goes
[14:49.360 --> 14:53.120]  what are you doing and I turned around I was just sitting there in a hot spring
[14:53.120 --> 14:55.920]  and I go what do you mean what are you doing and smile this year on this gun
[14:55.920 --> 15:01.120]  some mental patient I went whatever man and the guy felt stupid and walked off
[15:01.120 --> 15:04.600]  like I guess the average person would defecate on themselves or something
[15:04.600 --> 15:08.200]  when somebody puts a hand on their guy and says what are you doing I'm just
[15:08.200 --> 15:12.880]  sitting there so yeah the government wants to hire a bunch of mentally ill
[15:12.880 --> 15:16.760]  thugs while at the same time authorizing thugs to attack at the
[15:16.760 --> 15:21.800]  ground level and then have a clash of civilizations dialectic problem reaction
[15:21.800 --> 15:27.840]  solution that's the admitted formulae of the Ford Foundation and liberation
[15:27.840 --> 15:32.040]  theology and you've heard us talking about this for years saying this was
[15:32.040 --> 15:37.120]  coming this is one of their major operational plans now let's play the
[15:37.120 --> 15:41.920]  mayor the black mayor almost the entire city council is black everyone on the
[15:41.920 --> 15:49.040]  podium is black half the cops are black or more in Baltimore and they're making
[15:49.040 --> 15:54.640]  it about white people and there's calls by different black groups I've got it in
[15:54.640 --> 15:59.840]  my stack here the guerrilla family that's their own weird racist name for
[15:59.840 --> 16:03.680]  themselves and not mine I get emails when I mention the senator to kill cops
[16:03.680 --> 16:09.000]  and then it'll make the cops go into a total paranoia spiral it'll then cause
[16:09.000 --> 16:13.440]  them to stop responding even more to crime in predominantly black areas and
[16:13.440 --> 16:19.200]  it's it's it's it's just a recipe for total civil war and that's how the
[16:19.200 --> 16:24.000]  British brought down China was staging civil wars inside took them 50 years to
[16:24.000 --> 16:28.040]  set it up they got it going so I've studied history we're seeing it again
[16:28.040 --> 16:36.320]  here is the mayor we also gave those who wished to destroy space to do that as
[16:36.320 --> 16:44.320]  well and we work very hard to to keep that balance and and to put ourselves in
[16:44.320 --> 16:49.080]  the best position to de-escalate and that's what you saw the Justice
[16:49.080 --> 16:53.080]  Department runs Baltimore it's basically a suburb of DC the Justice
[16:53.080 --> 16:57.680]  Department runs the response they ran the funeral yesterday or the memorial
[16:57.680 --> 17:05.080]  service Crips and Bloods team up to protest Baltimore cops and say that
[17:05.080 --> 17:10.520]  they're going to start killing them and quote taking out officers
[17:12.520 --> 17:17.280]  meanwhile on the tonight show they've got people spouting off saying it's
[17:17.280 --> 17:23.600]  racist to call these people thugs I'll call them dumbed-down mindless scum just
[17:23.600 --> 17:27.240]  like I'll call the Klan out lynching people the same thing it's exact same
[17:27.240 --> 17:31.480]  mindset of people that have nothing have done nothing all they are is race-based
[17:31.480 --> 17:38.440]  and making excuses for their own failures thugs equals in word that's what was
[17:38.440 --> 17:42.760]  said on the tonight show what's being tweeted out when we come back after the
[17:42.760 --> 17:46.280]  break I'm going to give you the definition of thug where it actually
[17:46.280 --> 17:52.120]  comes from but first let's play the mayor one more time
[17:53.680 --> 18:01.120]  we also gave those who wished to destroy space to do that as well and we work
[18:01.120 --> 18:07.240]  very hard to to keep that balance and and to put ourselves in the best
[18:07.240 --> 18:11.680]  position to de-escalate and that's what really we're trying to de-escalate the
[18:11.680 --> 18:15.680]  civil war you want to start we're trying to stop the race war we're trying to get
[18:15.680 --> 18:19.480]  real justice we're trying to reform the police it's federal training that's
[18:19.480 --> 18:29.400]  giving them the attack dog mentality now let's go to a clip of her now talking
[18:29.400 --> 18:32.560]  about a civil emergency and then the governor so a day and a half after they
[18:32.560 --> 18:39.160]  let it all happen could have shut it down instantly a day and a half after
[18:39.160 --> 18:47.360]  that happened now this I've been in contact with our governor and he is
[18:47.360 --> 18:53.720]  agreed and and I've requested and he is agreed to deploy the National Guard as
[18:53.720 --> 19:00.240]  soon as they are available they will be immediately deployed we've ordered a
[19:00.240 --> 19:06.600]  curfew be in effect instituting tomorrow the curfew city wide wait a minute I
[19:06.600 --> 19:11.080]  thought you were going to de-escalate by letting false loot again there will be a
[19:11.080 --> 19:17.880]  city-wide curfew 10 p.m. to 5 a.m. this preliminary curfew will last for one
[19:17.880 --> 19:21.640]  week and be extended yeah this is how Americans are going to be trained to be
[19:21.640 --> 19:26.960]  slaves let me be clear we already operate under a juvenile curfew and those
[19:26.960 --> 19:32.040]  do those young people who are 14 that's enough just shut it down you know what
[19:32.040 --> 19:36.880]  juveniles should be doing like my dad working when they're 12 years old being
[19:36.880 --> 19:41.360]  given responsibilities learned to be responsible but no instead the youth
[19:41.360 --> 19:46.840]  that just pick up a gang culture a thug culture it's sold by MTV and then
[19:46.840 --> 19:50.160]  everybody's supposed to bow down to it and worship it and then no one can even
[19:50.160 --> 19:56.080]  stop people out attacking and looting and burning because the Justice

[22:06.400 --> 22:10.440]  then I discovered the New World Order the globalist their agenda I started an
[22:10.440 --> 22:14.480]  access television show I was so dedicated to my work and hanging around with
[22:14.480 --> 22:20.200]  radio guys that I began drinking I began smoking cigars and then even cigarettes
[22:20.200 --> 22:26.160]  I transformed from looking like a white Bruce Lee to looking like a job of the
[22:26.160 --> 22:32.440]  Hutt so I began a journey five years ago to shed the almost 100 pounds I started

[24:09.800 --> 24:16.160]  of property and put innocent Marylanders at significant risk I have declared a
[24:16.160 --> 24:24.640]  state of the emergency at the request of Baltimore City this order deploys the
[24:24.640 --> 24:33.080]  Maryland National Guard in order to help restore order and to end the unrest that
[24:33.080 --> 24:39.360]  we witnessed today and tonight I've not made this decision lightly the
[24:39.360 --> 24:43.200]  National Guard represents a last resort in order to restore order and that's
[24:43.200 --> 24:48.160]  governor Larry Hogan have the right to the establishment thinks we're so
[24:48.160 --> 24:53.960]  stupid that we don't realize that the Justice Department the Ford Foundation
[24:53.960 --> 25:01.480]  the universities MTV all these rappers and other people just want to feel like
[25:01.480 --> 25:06.720]  victims and just get up there all day hyping up tragic police shootings a
[25:06.720 --> 25:12.560]  lot of times the police get indicted a lot of times the police lose their
[25:12.560 --> 25:19.480]  jobs the cops that shot that white homeless guy for no reason have now
[25:19.480 --> 25:24.080]  been indicted in Albuquerque folks are getting indicted that are shooting
[25:24.080 --> 25:27.840]  black people in the back but we could show you footage of black cops shooting
[25:27.840 --> 25:31.720]  unarmed black people or black cops shooting white people and it most of
[25:31.720 --> 25:36.480]  time it's not racially based it's that the cops have been given instinctive
[25:36.480 --> 25:43.360]  firing training and don't know what they're doing in some cases and are so
[25:43.360 --> 25:49.200]  scared to death that they've got a hair trigger but still if you look at the
[25:49.200 --> 25:54.400]  statistics police shootings are flat in this country they're statistically what
[25:54.400 --> 26:01.080]  they were in the 90s if you go back to the 70s and 60s it was higher now a lot
[26:01.080 --> 26:03.520]  of that was probably leaded gasoline and things we know made people more
[26:03.520 --> 26:07.960]  aggressive there's major studies on that you know that's why the Romans were so
[26:07.960 --> 26:11.320]  aggressive they now know as they were lining their pots with lead there's a
[26:11.320 --> 26:16.200]  lot of chemical reasons for things that go on but the studies are there as well
[26:16.200 --> 26:21.080]  most cops even in black cities just don't want to go into the thug low income
[26:21.080 --> 26:25.560]  areas because they don't want to get shot at or they don't want to get sued or
[26:25.560 --> 26:30.640]  they don't want to get blamed they don't feel like this community support and so
[26:30.640 --> 26:36.040]  they don't respond that's why blacks are twice as less likely and we show the
[26:36.040 --> 26:42.160]  studies a few weeks ago in here to be shot than a white or Hispanic because
[26:42.160 --> 26:47.080]  whites predominantly but Hispanics a little bit less in statistics will call
[26:47.080 --> 26:53.720]  the cops and sometimes it goes bad you know you call the cops because your
[26:53.720 --> 26:57.040]  husband just punched in they end up killing him or you got a schizophrenic
[26:57.040 --> 27:00.840]  brother I read about this all the time I have family that this happened to a
[27:00.840 --> 27:06.200]  distant family but in Houston it was my great aunt's second husband so I'm not
[27:06.200 --> 27:09.720]  related but it was his daughter was schizophrenic and was freaking out and
[27:09.720 --> 27:14.680]  they called the cops and they came and killed her she was not even armed but
[27:14.680 --> 27:18.080]  she wouldn't come out and then the SWAT team went in and did they kill her
[27:18.080 --> 27:21.560]  because she was white no they killed her because you got 10 guys coming in your
[27:21.560 --> 27:28.040]  house with a bunch of guns people end up pulling the trigger
[27:28.040 --> 27:32.960]  grand jury just cleared a cop who shot a mentally old man for holding a screwdriver
[27:32.960 --> 27:40.480]  the point is we don't need a civil war out of this the point is why is the
[27:40.480 --> 27:45.760]  White House in George Soros spending hundreds of millions of dollars over
[27:45.760 --> 27:50.160]  the last few years 30 plus million just to stir up Ferguson garbage because it's
[27:50.160 --> 27:54.960]  all they've got is getting us to fight with each other and I know you get it
[27:54.960 --> 28:04.080]  but how do we get this information that we're covering out to the general public
[28:04.080 --> 28:09.840]  how do we do that that's the big question that we need to get across to
[28:09.840 --> 28:15.200]  everyone how do we expose it well we have the perfect opportunity you go to
[28:15.200 --> 28:21.320]  info wars calm you get the videos and the breakdowns of the people caught red
[28:21.320 --> 28:33.160]  handed red handed the mayor letting people loot and riot to get the ball
[28:33.160 --> 28:36.920]  rolling and the Justice Department stirring up Trayvon Martin secretly it
[28:36.920 --> 28:40.080]  turns out they're getting the riots going that didn't really catch fire and
[28:40.080 --> 28:46.480]  getting it going in Ferguson and then ordering the attack on media in Ferguson
[28:46.480 --> 28:50.880]  and in Baltimore in other areas because the media is the enemy especially if
[28:50.880 --> 28:55.000]  it's alternative media because we'll actually show the stand down and we're
[28:55.000 --> 28:59.920]  gonna go to break and come back and get to video brave Vietnam vet stands up to
[28:59.920 --> 29:06.240]  rioting children in Baltimore and also the video there's no audio but it's on
[29:06.240 --> 29:12.560]  ABC news of a mother going out finding her son teenage son who's looting and
[29:12.560 --> 29:19.520]  she starts beating him with a purse I wonder if the CPS is gonna come take I
[29:19.520 --> 29:25.280]  wonder if the CPS is gonna come and take his kid away her kid away because she
[29:25.280 --> 29:28.800]  dared stopping yeah I guess the cops are supposed to kill him or put him in
[29:28.800 --> 29:33.640]  prison you see probably comes from a fatherless home and there's mama trying
[29:33.640 --> 29:38.360]  to get him in line and he had the nerve looks like he's about 15 to slap her
[29:38.360 --> 29:43.200]  back when she was slapping him and all she's trying to do is keep him from
[29:43.200 --> 29:48.960]  going to prison that little thug needs to get his ass beat we're on the March
[29:48.960 --> 29:59.600]  the Empire's on the run Alex Jones and the GCN radio network did you know that
[29:59.600 --> 30:04.160]  the World Health Organization recently classified radio frequency EMFs as
[30:04.160 --> 30:09.840]  class 2b carcinogens that's right frequencies from radios TVs microwave
[30:09.840 --> 30:15.360]  ovens cell phones and Wi-Fi devices are now in the same category as exposure to
[30:15.360 --> 30:21.000]  lead chloroform gasoline and the pesticide DDT a recent scientific report
[30:21.000 --> 30:25.240]  titled why children absorb more microwave radiation than adults argued that
[30:25.240 --> 30:29.680]  children and fetuses absorb more microwave radiation because their bodies
[30:29.680 --> 30:34.160]  are relatively smaller their skulls are thinner and their brain tissue is more
[30:34.160 --> 30:37.880]  absorbent another study published by the British Medical Journal determined
[30:37.880 --> 30:42.320]  that exposure to cell phone towers alters brain function in alarming ways
[30:42.320 --> 30:46.840]  lack of concentration irritability difficulty sleeping but don't worry
[30:46.840 --> 30:51.120]  there's a pill for that to learn more subscribe to the Alex Jones channel on
[30:51.120 --> 30:55.480]  YouTube we are currently the test subjects in one big human experiment

[32:59.360 --> 33:05.800]  Hi I'm Janet Napolitano secretary of the Department of Homeland Security
[33:05.800 --> 33:11.640]  Homeland Security begins with hometown security
[33:13.880 --> 33:19.760]  it seems apparent that our citizens are staying off the streets which may make
[33:19.760 --> 33:25.440]  scarring particularly difficult even with this year's rule changes to recap
[33:25.440 --> 33:32.440]  those revisions women are still worth ten points more than men in all age
[33:32.440 --> 33:40.960]  brackets but teenagers now rack up 40 points and toddlers under 12 now rate a
[33:40.960 --> 33:51.000]  big 70 points the big score anyone any sex over 75 years old has been up to 100
[33:51.000 --> 34:10.440]  points as always resistance to tyrants is obedience to God it's Alex Jones
[34:14.000 --> 34:19.720]  coming up we've got Jacari Jackson's report talking to citizens protesting by
[34:19.720 --> 34:25.480]  the hundreds Jade Helm outside Austin Texas it was all over local television
[34:25.480 --> 34:30.360]  and in the local paper and also made national news yesterday as citizens
[34:30.360 --> 34:36.000]  exposed the attempt to basically end possecom and taught us but before I get
[34:36.000 --> 34:40.760]  into that and other world news and Max Kaiser joining us I wanted to show some
[34:40.760 --> 34:45.040]  video of your a TV viewer I'll describe it for radio listeners of what happened
[34:45.040 --> 34:52.080]  yesterday when a mother watching live coverage saw her son out involved in
[34:52.080 --> 34:57.640]  the looting was like he's about 1415 she comes over and starts basically punching
[34:57.640 --> 35:01.840]  him and slapping him in the head to make him stop looting he punches her back
[35:01.840 --> 35:07.960]  and this is really the sadness of single moms I bet a million dollars she is a
[35:07.960 --> 35:15.440]  single mom looks like she's maybe 30 years old probably had this guy when she
[35:15.440 --> 35:20.080]  was 15 and there she is trying to keep him from getting killed or keeping him
[35:20.080 --> 35:24.880]  from getting put in prison and he is basically slapping back at his mother
[35:24.880 --> 35:31.280]  where were the men to go over and help a woman trying to get her son in line
[35:31.280 --> 35:41.320]  well they were standing right there letting it happen truly disgusting but
[35:41.320 --> 35:45.120]  this is child abuse in America I guess it's better he be tasered or shot or
[35:45.120 --> 35:51.000]  put in prison what is she supposed to do but physically drag him out of there
[35:53.280 --> 36:00.400]  but these youth are never taught the dangers of the way they're behaving it's
[36:00.400 --> 36:03.280]  the same thing with the government the government's been caught over and over
[36:03.280 --> 36:07.600]  again doing every crime you can imagine but it's gotten away with it so now the
[36:07.600 --> 36:12.840]  central government far and run believes it can get away with anything but now
[36:12.840 --> 36:16.160]  the central government has read the tea leaves and knows the people are waking
[36:16.160 --> 36:20.080]  up so they want to have a nice little civil war which will have us begging for
[36:20.080 --> 36:24.440]  military on the streets and curfews permanently this could be the new false
[36:24.440 --> 36:30.160]  flag 9-11 as I've been saying for six years of Obama that they are preparing
[36:30.160 --> 36:36.720]  a race war 9-11 crisis and out of that crisis the next phase with republicans
[36:36.720 --> 36:42.120]  coming into office will be law and order where conservatives and libertarians
[36:42.120 --> 36:47.160]  and whites who feel threatened will accept a police state in the name of
[36:47.160 --> 36:51.800]  restoring order but then the police state will be flipped on yet again
[36:51.800 --> 36:59.040]  everyone this is the problem reaction solution hegelian dialectic from the
[36:59.040 --> 37:03.560]  philosopher hegel adopted by the chicago business school and the neocons and
[37:03.560 --> 37:12.000]  bipartisan Lee this is the plan you throw a brick through your window and
[37:12.000 --> 37:16.920]  blame your political opposition you firebomb your own capital and blame your
[37:16.920 --> 37:23.160]  opposition the Nazis did all of this but every other corrupt political party
[37:23.160 --> 37:28.400]  does it as well so many leftist jewish cribs have been caught attacking their
[37:28.400 --> 37:32.040]  own synagogues so many leftist black groups have been caught attacking their
[37:32.040 --> 37:37.240]  own churches so many leftist white groups have been caught claiming they
[37:37.240 --> 37:41.960]  were raped and it's done to garner sympathy because they know that
[37:41.960 --> 37:46.840]  Christians conservatives libertarians of every race color and creed are moral
[37:46.840 --> 37:53.040]  people that care and so we can be beaten into submission to feel guilty then
[37:53.040 --> 38:00.600]  in the to then accept their agenda their whole thing is about guilt be guilty
[38:00.600 --> 38:05.160]  you're a homophobe let us teach your three-year-old how to suck a golf ball
[38:05.160 --> 38:12.000]  through a garden hose that's what they teach we want your three-year-old to
[38:12.000 --> 38:16.840]  sign a pledge to have gay friends well like a three-year-old even knows what
[38:16.840 --> 38:21.160]  that is it's meant to make their whole mindset not about two plus two equals four
[38:21.160 --> 38:26.360]  not about mystery not about the stars not about nutrition not about family not
[38:26.360 --> 38:32.320]  about different cultures but sign a pledge to learn how to suck golf balls
[38:32.320 --> 38:42.680]  through garden hoses essentially I mean this is a scientific takeover I made a
[38:42.680 --> 38:49.160]  film about it in game 2.0 I called it 1.5 that's planning another
[38:49.160 --> 38:52.640]  installment and when you show the university documents with a professor
[38:52.640 --> 38:56.480]  from the 60s for the whole plan for this it's not like I know what's gonna
[38:56.480 --> 39:01.320]  happen next because I've got some big palantir some giant purple crystal ball
[39:01.320 --> 39:09.440]  in my living room I know what's going on because the globalists think we're all
[39:09.440 --> 39:18.240]  incredibly stupid and are just executing their takeover and that's why
[39:18.240 --> 39:21.560]  they can have the mayor come out and say we let folks loot let them get their
[39:21.560 --> 39:25.640]  anger out no that that actually gets it going because it sends the message hey
[39:25.640 --> 39:31.960]  you can get away with this just like they did in 1999 with predominantly I'd say
[39:31.960 --> 39:38.440]  90% white well-meaning liberals who were against non-gmo labeling and against
[39:38.440 --> 39:42.600]  losing our rights to WTO and international treaties good liberals
[39:42.600 --> 39:48.560]  educated real people the type that are against GMOs against vaccines they know
[39:48.560 --> 39:52.320]  what's going on they know the Democratic Party is corrupt they they show up by
[39:52.320 --> 39:59.480]  about 100,000 or so the airplanes land from Portland they disgorge 50 anarchists
[39:59.480 --> 40:03.800]  trained by the Ford Foundation publicly I made a film about it please stay to the
[40:03.800 --> 40:07.680]  takeover and the cops are ordered to stand down to be hitting the bottles it's
[40:07.680 --> 40:12.040]  shown on the news for a day the next day people say do something and they turn
[40:12.040 --> 40:15.840]  the cops loose on the hundred thousand peaceful and beat men women and children
[40:15.840 --> 40:21.640]  and tear gas children and then just it was it was disgusting and who ran it the
[40:21.640 --> 40:26.120]  Delta Force and when I had Esquire here last year doing a profile on me they
[40:26.120 --> 40:31.360]  didn't believe it and the Esquire writer went and pulled four different news
[40:31.360 --> 40:35.480]  articles interviewed the people involved and said oh my god it was a false flag
[40:35.480 --> 40:41.720]  and I said yeah I told you it was even in the newspaper we have interviews with
[40:41.720 --> 40:47.000]  the police captains I even interviewed later it's not in the film the police
[40:47.000 --> 40:52.280]  chief I've had the police chief on twice it was the police chief then and he's
[40:52.280 --> 40:56.400]  apologized he didn't even understand what was going on because again Bill
[40:56.400 --> 41:00.680]  Clinton was there world leaders were there the feds came in and took the whole
[41:00.680 --> 41:07.680]  operation over by the way Jacari Jackson and Joe Biggs are on an airplane right
[41:07.680 --> 41:12.640]  now I said guys you just were in Bastrop you just got shot in Ferguson with
[41:12.640 --> 41:16.880]  rubber bullets and tear gas you really want to go to this they said yeah we
[41:16.880 --> 41:21.920]  want to go and by the way anybody who hidden black by these racist mobs are
[41:21.920 --> 41:26.960]  being attacked so I'm really worried about Joe Biggs but he wants to do it you
[41:26.960 --> 41:31.560]  know to CNN MSNBC only have black reporters out there but no one's
[41:31.560 --> 41:35.960]  mentioning hey why aren't the white reporters this is a racist mob that's
[41:35.960 --> 41:40.600]  what I mean can you imagine the Klan you know if whites were out burning things
[41:40.600 --> 41:45.200]  they'd be stopped and imagine if there was only white reporters that could be
[41:45.200 --> 41:48.800]  out of people say look how racist it is they attack any black reporters I mean
[41:48.800 --> 41:53.760]  it's just hiding in plain view how racism by black people has been sold as a
[41:53.760 --> 41:58.520]  cultural right as something you're supposed to do under political correctness
[41:58.520 --> 42:05.880]  with the modern hip-hop music racially based the rest of it anything goes
[42:05.880 --> 42:10.400]  but there's a video of a brave Vietnam vets standing up to rioting children his
[42:10.400 --> 42:17.760]  words in Baltimore I love my country I love my charm city I'm not black I'm
[42:17.760 --> 42:24.400]  white-red yellow or nothing and we've got Robert Valentine out there standing
[42:24.400 --> 42:27.400]  up there's also photos he's interviewed by local paper of a white
[42:27.400 --> 42:32.000]  gentleman guarding his shop with a machete and he says he kept about 50
[42:32.000 --> 42:36.080]  looters at bay where are the guns well you pull a gun out there the cops will
[42:36.080 --> 42:41.480]  take you out again this all is in these inner city Petri dishes that are models
[42:41.480 --> 42:46.320]  for how they want everybody else to live under the UN UNESCO global treaty
[42:46.320 --> 42:54.720]  agenda 21 it's the only thing I have I can't pull out a shotgun he told the
[42:54.720 --> 42:59.360]  Washington Post I was able to clear about 50 people away I came with my mask
[42:59.360 --> 43:04.120]  on my face ready to do but I had to protect my livelihood we've got the
[43:04.120 --> 43:09.040]  photo of the gentleman who looks pretty scary out there with his machete and his
[43:09.040 --> 43:15.040]  society degenerates you wanted to protect his convenience store as society
[43:15.040 --> 43:19.240]  degenerates you're going to see more and more law the jungle that's why they
[43:19.240 --> 43:23.120]  want our guns so the government can create the crisis and then bring in the
[43:23.120 --> 43:27.640]  tyranny as the solution they can't let normal equilibrium take place where
[43:27.640 --> 43:31.560]  people will protect themselves the problem is as we had professor lot on
[43:31.560 --> 43:36.240]  yesterday the demographic changing blacks have been one of the lowest groups to
[43:36.240 --> 43:39.520]  own guns one reason was it was prohibited to them by racist laws
[43:39.520 --> 43:43.440]  passing the south the first gun control laws by the Klan that's just an array
[43:43.440 --> 43:46.600]  was set up to stop that that's why they're called the new Kugelsk Klan because
[43:46.600 --> 43:49.520]  they were founded the fight to this plan that's the inverted MSNBC fraud
[43:49.520 --> 43:56.120]  machine you're founded the fight the Klan so you're now the clan you're
[43:56.120 --> 44:00.360]  founded by the Klan to kill people you're given awards by the NAACP Planned
[44:00.360 --> 44:04.800]  Parenthood it's inverted you you worship Hitler you tell Rolling Stone you want
[44:04.800 --> 44:08.480]  to be Hitler your dad is an SS officer you're the product of an SS race marriage
[44:08.480 --> 44:12.400]  you're given ADL awards Arnold Schwarzenegger you fight racism you're
[44:12.400 --> 44:19.960]  called a racist by the ADL just it how it works it's reality inverted literally
[44:19.960 --> 44:27.000]  people say I use that word too much but it is I'm not just saying let's play a
[44:27.000 --> 44:36.320]  club of Valentine and and you sort of took it upon yourself to tell those young
[44:36.320 --> 44:40.960]  people as a black reporter wonder why when you're a little bit concerned about
[44:40.960 --> 44:46.800]  your own
[44:46.800 --> 44:52.080]  came out of NASA so I'd seen more than all this I've been through the riots
[44:52.080 --> 44:57.280]  already this right here is not relevant they need to have their butts at home
[44:57.280 --> 45:01.520]  they need to be in their home units with their family studying and doing
[45:01.520 --> 45:04.840]  something with their life not how he protested about something that's not
[45:04.840 --> 45:11.960]  really about nothing they do not respect this young man's death you know now
[45:11.960 --> 45:17.600]  mama and daddy didn't lost a child that could be there so I'm very pissed so
[45:17.600 --> 45:22.760]  what's your name Valentine was your first name Robert Robert Valentine's and
[45:22.760 --> 45:26.880]  you're a Vietnam vet yes and you just decided to come out here and stand up
[45:26.880 --> 45:33.400]  against these guys yes you know a lot of people would think twice wouldn't they I
[45:33.400 --> 45:38.880]  love my country I love my charm city and I'm an American I'm not black white
[45:38.880 --> 45:43.080]  better yelling up I am a man are you concerned about what's happening to the
[45:43.080 --> 45:47.040]  community yes all right thank you and of course they shut it down right there
[45:47.040 --> 45:53.200]  isn't like what he was saying I guess but burn down your own community and now
[45:53.200 --> 45:55.760]  I've got a stack of articles where the looters are saying they're gonna be
[45:55.760 --> 46:01.440]  shooting cops white cops I'm really worried about Joe Biggs and jacari we
[46:01.440 --> 46:05.280]  had folks start fights with the jacari as well and call him an uncle Tom and
[46:05.280 --> 46:10.400]  stuff just because he was there from Info Wars because he fighting the black
[46:10.400 --> 46:15.560]  genocide via abortion that's not good going out and looting that's that's
[46:15.560 --> 46:22.200]  that's good because the media said so because Al Sharpton he has the moral he
[46:22.200 --> 46:29.560]  has the moral high ground now continuing here I want to juxtapose this the
[46:29.560 --> 46:35.200]  peaceful demonstrations that took place yesterday hundreds of people in Bastrop
[46:35.200 --> 46:40.560]  exposing Jade Helm and jacari Jackson outside of the convention area outside
[46:40.560 --> 46:44.760]  of the auditorium was able to get some of the citizens take on why they were
[46:44.760 --> 46:50.440]  there almost to a person almost to a man almost to a woman against what was
[46:50.440 --> 46:56.200]  happening there at the preparations for Jade Helm outside Austin Texas here it
[46:56.200 --> 47:00.160]  is all right sir can you tell me what your name is where you're from and what
[47:00.160 --> 47:03.720]  brought you out here today my name is Daniel Duclu I'm from Bastrop Texas I
[47:03.720 --> 47:10.160]  went to school in Austin and I'm a concerned American Texan Bastropian I
[47:10.160 --> 47:13.400]  just think the government should be held accountable to the decisions they make
[47:13.400 --> 47:18.240]  and I think it's our it's our privilege and it's it's our duty as Americans to
[47:18.240 --> 47:20.800]  ask questions about what our government's doing these are elected
[47:20.800 --> 47:27.280]  officials or our judges not the not the guy with the army but you know I think
[47:27.280 --> 47:31.000]  it's our duty to hold them accountable so okay we're here with Kathy Glass he
[47:31.000 --> 47:34.360]  ran for governor this past election and I was very surprised to see you come out
[47:34.360 --> 47:37.840]  here for this Jade Helm why is it so significant to you well my husband and
[47:37.840 --> 47:42.720]  I have a small ranch in McDave so we live a half-life in Houston and half life
[47:42.720 --> 47:46.240]  out here in Lee County actually so what's happening in Bastrop is very
[47:46.240 --> 47:50.360]  important to us but it's important to all Texans this is not just a local thing
[47:50.360 --> 47:56.360]  going on we're talking about the group Jade Helm stop we're still doing ground
[47:56.360 --> 48:02.600]  holes correct yeah okay all right Jade Helm and Bastrop yes sir okay all right
[48:02.600 --> 48:06.720]  how many questions are you gonna ask do you ask everybody how many questions
[48:06.720 --> 48:09.240]  I'm gonna ask she asked you several times I'm asking you how many questions do you
[48:09.240 --> 48:15.240]  plan on asking let's say I'll stop at five max five max three three let's go
[48:15.240 --> 48:19.440]  three all right post have you say and spell your name and position Lieutenant
[48:19.440 --> 48:22.480]  Colonel Mark LaStoria Director of Public Affairs United States Army Special
[48:22.480 --> 48:26.280]  Operations Command all right Colonel you spent a lot of time answering questions
[48:26.280 --> 48:31.280]  I'm trying not to be redundant but just in most general soundbites since what is
[48:31.280 --> 48:36.240]  Jade Helm Jade Helm is a training exercise to produce top quality US Army
[48:36.240 --> 48:40.240]  Special Operations Forces for operations overseas future operations overseas
[48:40.240 --> 48:46.760]  okay and you had a lot of concern here today is fair to say there were a lot
[48:46.760 --> 48:50.840]  of questions asked here today and I was really supportive of that I think local
[48:50.840 --> 48:55.760]  governance is a fantastic thing and much like the other judge said it'd be great
[48:55.760 --> 48:59.600]  if everybody came out in force like that to all of their meetings local
[48:59.600 --> 49:03.320]  governance is where things happen but I wouldn't really question more of a
[49:03.320 --> 49:07.040]  statement but I'll try to be concise as possible I saw a question about Metrus
[49:07.040 --> 49:10.680]  Global and Thomas Meade I believe are involved in this operation I'm sorry who
[49:10.680 --> 49:14.680]  Metrus Global and Thomas Meade I'm not familiar with what was the first thing
[49:14.680 --> 49:18.200]  again Metrus Global no I'm not familiar with that Thomas Meade Thomas Meade he
[49:18.200 --> 49:22.440]  is a coordinator for the exercise all right I'm here with ZZ Arnetta former
[49:22.440 --> 49:26.080]  Info Wars reporter you are here you asked the question what do you think about
[49:26.080 --> 49:29.960]  this Jade Helm operation and also their response to it well overall I think I'm
[49:29.960 --> 49:35.880]  mostly disappointed in the way that they let the public know I found out about
[49:35.880 --> 49:42.160]  it from the Bastrop County paper on the internet and it was coming out the same
[49:42.160 --> 49:46.120]  time it came out on Info Wars it's like they're saying one thing and then
[49:46.120 --> 49:48.920]  they're saying another thing at the same time out of both sides of their mouths
[49:48.920 --> 49:52.840]  so it's confusing yes when you're talking about putting people in civilian
[49:52.840 --> 49:56.760]  clothing I just do not understand what that matters since this is supposed to
[49:56.760 --> 50:02.400]  be about foreign territory I was just concerned with the increasing
[50:02.400 --> 50:06.320]  indications that the military is getting a little too involved with local
[50:06.320 --> 50:12.880]  law enforcement first of all we got this military assault vehicle that signed to
[50:12.880 --> 50:17.040]  our Sheriff's Department and then we have all these strange things happening
[50:17.040 --> 50:21.480]  coming in here like this military operation which is not new for our
[50:21.480 --> 50:25.880]  county because we have Camp Swift and I have helicopters flying over my property
[50:25.880 --> 50:31.320]  all the time I don't have any problem with that the thing that the indications
[50:31.320 --> 50:36.120]  that are happening that they're getting so involved that it does appear there is
[50:36.120 --> 50:41.120]  some martial law intent you know I think one concern of mine is well first of
[50:41.120 --> 50:45.400]  all I grew up here I know Camp Swift is a big military base you can see the full
[50:45.400 --> 50:49.840]  report at info wars.com we're also going to tweet it out if citizens fight back
[50:49.840 --> 50:54.200]  against Jane Helm takeover that's only a third of it we're gonna come back with
[50:54.200 --> 50:58.080]  an incredible report by Paul Watson on subliminal message he caught on martial

[53:57.960 --> 54:19.680]  I was going to get to one of the most bone-chilling bizarro stories I've
[54:19.680 --> 54:25.600]  ever seen you know we're constantly catching subliminal messages on radio
[54:25.600 --> 54:33.720]  TV and in print and documenting them here just bald-faced subliminal messages
[54:33.720 --> 54:38.240]  that are too quick to consciously pick up but I'll have to cover this some
[54:38.240 --> 54:44.200]  next hour because we just had some even bigger breaking news I mean I already
[54:44.200 --> 54:50.400]  said it earlier because I already knew it but now it's been triple confirmed but
[54:50.400 --> 55:01.760]  Paul Watson's story is amazing and it's up on infowars.com right now with the
[55:01.760 --> 55:14.440]  video a subliminal message in an AARP article story TV ad and in the TV ad
[55:14.440 --> 55:18.760]  the woman's just sitting there knitting and the voiceover is talking about other
[55:18.760 --> 55:24.000]  things but then in the background the TV is talking about riots across America
[55:24.000 --> 55:29.760]  and martial law at a subliminal level that if you boost the audio it's as
[55:29.760 --> 55:34.240]  clear as day quote riots nationwide a problem the local governments declare
[55:34.240 --> 55:38.320]  martial law the president is asking the citizens find safety and remain calm
[55:38.320 --> 55:45.120]  authorities are working to contain the outbreak so there's just massive
[55:45.120 --> 55:48.800]  preparations for martial law we've got all the government documents under
[55:48.800 --> 55:51.320]  martial law they're gonna target veterans gun owners conservatives
[55:51.320 --> 55:55.480]  libertarians that's all admitted and then the army shows up and goes to hundreds
[55:55.480 --> 55:58.400]  of people going well you're planning for martial law here's the document no or
[55:58.400 --> 56:02.760]  not it's preposterous hey they're death panels in Obamacare here's the subsection
[56:02.760 --> 56:10.360]  shut up racist hey you're raising the net limit no we're not doesn't raise the
[56:10.360 --> 56:15.960]  net but it does raise that no it doesn't we got does no doesn't I mean it's
[56:15.960 --> 56:20.440]  getting crazy but on the dumb down public this stuff works it's all a
[56:20.440 --> 56:24.880]  confidence game he's in the military uniform or he's in the government outfit
[56:24.880 --> 56:30.520]  and they're telling us this so it must be true Kit Daniels dug into it I mean I
[56:30.520 --> 56:34.000]  knew just from past study that Baltimore is one of the most federally
[56:34.000 --> 56:41.760]  controlled cities other than DC and the country and they just roll out forced
[56:41.760 --> 56:45.720]  inoculations there outside of law you name it time and time again and I knew
[56:45.720 --> 56:50.040]  this lady was in deep with Obama so I just said this is just department run
[56:50.040 --> 56:52.720]  because I know they got their people there that's been confirmed because it
[56:52.720 --> 56:58.160]  always is but I I kind of went with my gut I mean I that was my opinion based
[56:58.160 --> 57:03.040]  on giant piles of knowledge well here it is breaking Baltimore mayor key player
[57:03.040 --> 57:07.800]  in Obama's federal takeover of local police one of only three people involved
[57:07.800 --> 57:12.080]  in the quote task force that gave the recommendation for total federalization
[57:12.080 --> 57:17.480]  on the back of the problems the court in Ferguson oh the answer is federalized
[57:17.480 --> 57:21.200]  the police because they're so racist mayor's a link to just department
[57:21.200 --> 57:27.480]  explains why she gave rioters space to destroy they're getting ready to kick
[57:27.480 --> 57:32.120]  off a long hot summer and then cops are gonna get trigger fingers black ones
[57:32.120 --> 57:36.920]  white ones this they're black they're gonna get shot and all hell is gonna
[57:36.920 --> 57:41.760]  break loose this is just how George Soros took down Ukraine it's how they took
[57:41.760 --> 57:44.960]  down Egypt it's how they tried to take down Syria it's how they took down
[57:44.960 --> 57:50.120]  Libya this is how they do it is sectarian war it could be religious it
[57:50.120 --> 57:54.280]  could be racial it could be cultural it could be regional it could be old beefs
[57:54.280 --> 57:59.240]  sectarian manipulation coming up I never got to it I'm gonna give you the
[57:59.240 --> 58:03.880]  definition of a thug thug isn't racist thug comes from a group of Arab bandits
[58:03.880 --> 58:08.600]  that would rob the silk road out of India through Arabia and we're known for
[58:08.600 --> 58:14.360]  grotting people choking him to death the thuggy and that's why they say that
[58:14.360 --> 58:19.120]  guy's a thug it just means bandit and the people out there looting look at the
[58:19.120 --> 58:25.440]  white soccer fans that loot and rob oh people call them thugs oh no they're

[01:01:00.600 --> 01:01:05.280]  gonna break down more thoroughly the definition of thug because it doesn't
[01:01:05.280 --> 01:01:09.280]  matter if the Baltimore mayor playing both sides who allowed the looting to
[01:01:09.280 --> 01:01:13.200]  intensify now was declared a civil emergency in the city along with the
[01:01:13.200 --> 01:01:18.920]  governor over the state and curfews she's called them thugs but we've got
[01:01:18.920 --> 01:01:23.320]  different quote black activist and the drummer for the late show and others
[01:01:23.320 --> 01:01:32.760]  coming out saying it's code word for the n-word. No it's code word for thugs the
[01:01:32.760 --> 01:01:38.720]  thuggy. Hindi refers to thugs organized gang of professional assassins the
[01:01:38.720 --> 01:01:42.360]  thugs traveled and groups across Asia for 600 years although the thugs trace
[01:01:42.360 --> 01:01:46.840]  their origin to seven Muslim tribes. Hindus appeared to have been associated
[01:01:46.840 --> 01:01:54.400]  with them in an early period. They were first mentioned in Ziya under then
[01:01:54.400 --> 01:02:02.440]  Brani's history of the Firsuz Shah I know I butchered that dated around 1356 in
[01:02:02.440 --> 01:02:07.920]  1830s they were targeted for eradication by William Benichick governor general
[01:02:07.920 --> 01:02:13.720]  of India and his chief captain William Henry Salim the thuggies were seemingly
[01:02:13.720 --> 01:02:18.760]  destroyed by this effort the thugs would join travelers and gain their
[01:02:18.760 --> 01:02:23.320]  confidence this would allow them surprise and strangle their victims by
[01:02:23.320 --> 01:02:26.640]  pulling a handkerchief or noose tied around their necks they would then rob
[01:02:26.640 --> 01:02:30.480]  their victims of valuables and bury their bodies this led them to also be
[01:02:30.480 --> 01:02:38.320]  called English for using the noose how do you say that fan singar a term were
[01:02:38.320 --> 01:02:43.320]  commonly used in southern India the term thuggy is derived from the hindi word
[01:02:43.320 --> 01:02:52.520]  which means deceiver related words are the verb thuggy to deceive or cunning
[01:02:52.520 --> 01:02:58.800]  sly fraudulent the term for particular kind of murder or robbery of travelers
[01:02:58.800 --> 01:03:04.600]  is popular in South Asia and particularly in India still today and it
[01:03:04.600 --> 01:03:09.560]  was a gang history and recruitment but hey who needs science and history and
[01:03:09.560 --> 01:03:14.800]  words you can just say racist I don't like the flavor of this food racist I

[01:03:43.880 --> 01:03:48.880]  the castle and Count Dracula's trying to eat him but he gets the magic book and

[01:09:01.240 --> 01:09:10.520]  situation why is JP Morgan chase hoarding 50 million ounces of silver as zero heads reported
[01:09:11.240 --> 01:09:14.440]  we've seen all this economic data that the economy worldwide is sliding
[01:09:15.880 --> 01:09:22.680]  what does this really mean but meanwhile breaking this is on info wars.com Baltimore mayor key
[01:09:22.680 --> 01:09:28.040]  player in Obama's federal takeover local police she's the one calling for the response to riots
[01:09:28.040 --> 01:09:34.840]  in Stevan Ferguson for federalization she's on the task force only three people are three mayors
[01:09:34.840 --> 01:09:40.040]  mayor link to just department explains why she gave rioters space to destroy and if you just
[01:09:40.040 --> 01:09:44.680]  tuned in we played it like four times last hour we'll play it again in a moment she said we gave
[01:09:44.680 --> 01:09:51.880]  people a space to riot here's the deal there is police brutality there are a lot of corrupt
[01:09:51.880 --> 01:09:58.360]  departments where bad cops get away with stuff but on average the average cop is just a revenue
[01:09:58.360 --> 01:10:06.120]  generator who also responds to crime and it's a horrible job and I would want it and the establishment
[01:10:06.120 --> 01:10:11.880]  has been caught funding and financing demonstrations here to get us all fighting with each other
[01:10:11.880 --> 01:10:16.520]  no one can deny that they knew a revolution was coming in the middle east a legitimate one so they
[01:10:16.520 --> 01:10:24.360]  triggered it the arab spring and then they put radicals in instead of reformers so they hijack
[01:10:24.360 --> 01:10:28.600]  legitimate movements they know what they're doing black unemployment is doubled look i'm
[01:10:28.600 --> 01:10:35.400]  nonpartisan but under obama they've been able to really in the democratic party give black people
[01:10:35.400 --> 01:10:40.360]  the short end of the stick because hey you got to support him anyway so they've been taken for
[01:10:40.360 --> 01:10:47.080]  granted but they find poll numbers go up if they can get some racial stuff going now when a black
[01:10:47.080 --> 01:10:51.080]  cop shoots a black guy it's not hardly in the news or a black cop shoots a white guy it's not in
[01:10:51.080 --> 01:10:58.840]  the news but a white guy shoots a black guy i mean they've indicted the cop that shot the
[01:10:58.840 --> 01:11:04.760]  black guy in the back a few weeks ago most of the time they get indicted and go to jail
[01:11:04.760 --> 01:11:10.200]  so why is this the only issue in the world that and transgender bathrooms
[01:11:11.240 --> 01:11:16.840]  the universe is not just about transgender and uh you know a black person getting shot
[01:11:16.840 --> 01:11:23.000]  once a week in the back and i'm sad you got shot in the back but i mean 52 percent of
[01:11:23.000 --> 01:11:27.240]  blacks never got out of mama and i don't find black people that are quote liberals that care
[01:11:27.240 --> 01:11:34.520]  about that need black lives matter demonstrations outside plan parenthood it's just crazy and then
[01:11:34.520 --> 01:11:38.200]  if you call these looters thugs i mean you notice you don't see any white reporters out there that's
[01:11:38.200 --> 01:11:45.000]  because they get attacked they've been getting attacked but cnn won't point that out this is how
[01:11:45.000 --> 01:11:51.880]  british controlled countries through sectarianism through divide and conquer and now they've declared
[01:11:51.880 --> 01:11:57.400]  civil emergency uh they're saying you can't be out after dark for adults as well see first it
[01:11:57.400 --> 01:12:02.440]  was for the youth already in place didn't keep them from looting now it's for everybody and this
[01:12:02.440 --> 01:12:06.840]  will be the new 911 big riots this summer oh you can tell that's where this is going
[01:12:08.200 --> 01:12:14.280]  and then there'll be reforms which is federalization of police the very feds that train the cops that
[01:12:14.280 --> 01:12:19.080]  act like paramilitary and who are giving them the weapons so it's a problem reaction solution
[01:12:19.080 --> 01:12:26.040]  fund al qaeda they attack us take your liberties fund radical black groups to go out and do stuff
[01:12:26.600 --> 01:12:30.520]  then you get to federalize the police take liberties i mean it's the same story over and
[01:12:30.520 --> 01:12:36.200]  over again that's my breakdown on the situation but here is the mayor saying we provided an area
[01:12:37.080 --> 01:12:45.800]  for the people to basically destroy here's the clip um we also gave those who wished to destroy
[01:12:45.800 --> 01:12:54.600]  space to do that as well and we work very hard to uh to keep that balance and and to put ourselves
[01:12:54.600 --> 01:13:01.080]  in the best position to de-escalate and that's what you saw i mean and it also makes the entire
[01:13:01.080 --> 01:13:06.280]  black culture about grandstanding when you're wronged instead of just being successful in
[01:13:06.280 --> 01:13:11.720]  life and business you've got a city almost completely run by black people and still it's
[01:13:11.720 --> 01:13:21.480]  white races killed the black person the whole universe does not revolve around a few hundred
[01:13:21.480 --> 01:13:26.920]  black men shot every year and then you got thousands shot by blacks and nobody cares
[01:13:27.640 --> 01:13:32.520]  so like 14 000 blacks are shot by blacks every year look up the number i mean it's just a total
[01:13:32.520 --> 01:13:38.840]  diversion there's a whole universe around us we're busy just looking at these petty issues
[01:13:38.840 --> 01:13:43.160]  which they make the biggest issues in the world nobody fights the police state more than i do
[01:13:43.160 --> 01:13:49.160]  i want to get max keiser max keiser's take uh on all this and we'll get into uh just huge
[01:13:49.160 --> 01:13:54.520]  amount of news he wants to cover uh u.s defense industry opt performs s and p by a hundred percent
[01:13:55.560 --> 01:14:00.600]  we're going to get into uh montana second state to slow police militarization see that's
[01:14:00.600 --> 01:14:06.120]  conservative areas they're trying to stop that um there's people moving against the nsa system
[01:14:06.120 --> 01:14:11.400]  that's the tea party doing that keiser wants to get into a whole host of issues max keiser first
[01:14:11.400 --> 01:14:14.760]  off thanks for joining us it's been a while i'm going to skip this network break so we have more
[01:14:14.760 --> 01:14:19.560]  time and you get back the time we just missed uh you've got a new report out the age of false
[01:14:19.560 --> 01:14:24.280]  profits that's excellent at max keiser dot com folks to go watch that we may even play a clip
[01:14:24.280 --> 01:14:30.840]  of that later uh but but what you just heard my five minute rant about what i think uh is going
[01:14:30.840 --> 01:14:36.200]  on behind this obsession with rioting and looting and and and police officers what do you think's
[01:14:36.200 --> 01:14:41.880]  behind it oh hey alex how's it going how's my sound by the way i'm trying out a new phone okay you
[01:14:41.880 --> 01:14:47.720]  sound great max good to have you here where you where are you joining us from i am in london and i
[01:14:47.720 --> 01:14:52.360]  you know i moved here two and a half years ago and i don't know if you remember but when i was on
[01:14:52.360 --> 01:14:57.480]  your show two and a half years ago three years ago i used to tell you about the fact that we did
[01:14:57.480 --> 01:15:03.000]  the show we shared a studio with voice of america that's right i have the article right here about
[01:15:03.000 --> 01:15:09.960]  voice of america is having big problems right now yeah uh you know and at the time you know they're
[01:15:09.960 --> 01:15:16.920]  they're basically falling apart the skies leaving david and soar just left and the thing about voice
[01:15:16.920 --> 01:15:24.920]  of america is uh they were having trouble competing with rt and press tv and i was doing a show on
[01:15:24.920 --> 01:15:31.800]  both of those networks and voice of america was you know coming on to me saying you got to work
[01:15:31.800 --> 01:15:37.160]  for voice of america come on over to voice of america and i said no you know you guys are just
[01:15:37.160 --> 01:15:46.200]  propaganda and then uh the offers started to come in for money uh the amounts of money started to get
[01:15:46.200 --> 01:15:52.440]  bigger and i kept saying no no you guys are propaganda you don't get it i do news you guys
[01:15:52.440 --> 01:15:59.240]  are propaganda and then you know i started hearing about these our correspondents at rt
[01:15:59.240 --> 01:16:06.440]  being approached by voice of america and these other folks like the broadcasting board of governor
[01:16:06.440 --> 01:16:15.880]  folks and then before you know it this was wall thing went down so i i said to myself they finally
[01:16:15.880 --> 01:16:23.160]  found one they finally nabbed one so i don't know what the quid pro quo was i know the
[01:16:23.160 --> 01:16:27.560]  numbers they were throwing at me were pretty big i can only imagine the numbers they were
[01:16:27.560 --> 01:16:32.120]  they threw did you see the rt reporter that you're talking about who did that whole stage thing that
[01:16:32.120 --> 01:16:37.880]  she quit testifying before congress we played it last week saying basically get rid of free speech
[01:16:37.880 --> 01:16:42.200]  and then and that evil alternative media must be stopped they asked me to do that
[01:16:43.320 --> 01:16:47.320]  wait a minute you're breaking you're breaking major news you're saying you were approached
[01:16:47.320 --> 01:16:53.560]  to do a staged defection from rt yeah i need to talk to you on the show like two and a half years
[01:16:53.560 --> 01:16:59.800]  ago we shared a studio with voice of america i remember i used to dial in and you were there
[01:16:59.800 --> 01:17:07.800]  okay you got the floor to tell us what happened well exactly what i just said and i've said on
[01:17:07.800 --> 01:17:14.040]  your show before when we're doing our show in paris we shared a studio at the voice of america
[01:17:14.040 --> 01:17:17.480]  and they would come on and they would do their propaganda and they would say you know what you
[01:17:17.480 --> 01:17:21.560]  you should be a patriot you shouldn't be doing rt or press tv you need to be doing voice of america
[01:17:21.560 --> 01:17:28.360]  i said no you guys are pure propaganda so then as rt started to get more and more popular
[01:17:28.360 --> 01:17:34.440]  they started coming back to me with come on over and they started talking about doing like a staged
[01:17:35.160 --> 01:17:40.920]  on air defection and it's going to be worth your while and they started talking about some
[01:17:40.920 --> 01:17:47.880]  sums of money that were not insignificant i kept saying no you don't get it you guys are propaganda
[01:17:47.880 --> 01:17:53.000]  i'm a journalist that's two different things so then when the lizz wall thing went down i'm like
[01:17:53.000 --> 01:17:58.040]  i checked around and they're like yeah you know as as we all knew eventually they would find the
[01:17:58.040 --> 01:18:03.320]  weak spot in the organization with their offer well max i didn't know when you were coming on
[01:18:03.320 --> 01:18:07.800]  the day i wanted to bring up voice for america where i know you were uh studio doubted in paris
[01:18:07.800 --> 01:18:12.360]  because we used to connect to you there via skype to do interviews with you know beautiful shot of
[01:18:12.360 --> 01:18:19.640]  the city behind you this is simply amazing you're a major accredited reporter saying that fully a
[01:18:19.640 --> 01:18:25.640]  year before she did her stage defection they came to you and ask you to stage the same event
[01:18:25.640 --> 01:18:30.920]  and say that rt was a fraud and control what you were saying and i mean did they go that far
[01:18:30.920 --> 01:18:34.920]  to have you basically script what you were going to say or were they just seeing if you would do it
[01:18:36.280 --> 01:18:42.120]  well as it wasn't just me mind you there's a couple of other people as well and we kind of
[01:18:42.120 --> 01:18:48.280]  shared notes about this and uh we knew that eventually they would find a weak spot we just
[01:18:48.280 --> 01:18:53.960]  didn't know who approached you and what do they say exactly well this voice of america so they have
[01:18:53.960 --> 01:18:59.800]  a facility in paris and they did we would do our show and then they came into the studio and they
[01:18:59.800 --> 01:19:05.000]  did their show so in every couple of months and somebody knew because nobody wants to work
[01:19:05.000 --> 01:19:09.160]  for voice of america because they're failing because their message is i know but specifically
[01:19:09.160 --> 01:19:12.360]  can you say if you don't want to say i totally understand because they may have said it was
[01:19:12.360 --> 01:19:15.320]  in confidence but were you approached by the news director you're approached by the folks
[01:19:15.320 --> 01:19:19.240]  you're releasing the time from and they're satellite equipment i mean do they say hey max
[01:19:19.240 --> 01:19:24.760]  you're on a stage of defection you know around the coffee cooler i mean what happened well they
[01:19:24.760 --> 01:19:29.960]  were trying to arrange a meeting with this guy david anzor i'll say i'll say that and like this
[01:19:29.960 --> 01:19:33.320]  this is the guy who you need to talk to and i said you know i don't need to talk to any of those
[01:19:33.320 --> 01:19:39.400]  people because you guys are pure propagandist and i'm a journalist that's a big difference
[01:19:39.400 --> 01:19:49.160]  you guys have so here we are in 2015 and they're ramping up this this war uh you know against
[01:19:49.880 --> 01:19:53.320]  journalism against independent journalism you're being you're being pulled into this
[01:19:53.320 --> 01:20:00.040]  as well so it's saying rt info wars and isis are the bad guys yeah they've said that in congress
[01:20:00.040 --> 01:20:06.520]  and they're playing on a russian agent uh all because i don't support world war three exactly
[01:20:06.520 --> 01:20:13.480]  because we report on the news we provide people with like luke rickowski who's an excellent
[01:20:13.480 --> 01:20:17.480]  reporter he's been on your show many times he's been on my show many times he just did a fantastic
[01:20:17.480 --> 01:20:23.640]  report about what's really going on in ukraine that there's a kill list that the ukrainian
[01:20:23.640 --> 01:20:29.560]  government is publishing on the online and then these people are getting murdered and these people
[01:20:29.560 --> 01:20:35.960]  are supported by the u.s the kill list is being generated by the u.s so and that's who the voice
[01:20:35.960 --> 01:20:42.680]  of america wants the world to support and if you don't follow that narrative you are somehow with
[01:20:42.680 --> 01:20:50.200]  isis or alex jones and we're being attacked along those lines meanwhile rt continues to get bigger
[01:20:50.200 --> 01:20:56.840]  and bigger and bigger because we're just doing the job of journalism versus voice of america which
[01:20:56.840 --> 01:21:02.760]  is well i mean this wall lady it was so state she does i'm quitting this place is propaganda and
[01:21:02.760 --> 01:21:08.360]  obviously it leans towards putin and i think it's a little too leftist the shows are varied but i know
[01:21:08.360 --> 01:21:13.720]  that i've been on there probably 200 times never been censored i know that you put out stuff that
[01:21:13.720 --> 01:21:18.920]  it's just it's hardcore it's truthful it's geopolitical it's from an individual's perspective
[01:21:18.920 --> 01:21:25.560]  it isn't russian leaning but but it's just i've also been on the bbc probably 50 times
[01:21:25.560 --> 01:21:32.040]  and and and japanese tv you know it doesn't mean i promote their ideas by the by rt i have been
[01:21:32.040 --> 01:21:37.880]  censored by the bbc the bbc aggressively censored me the bbc is the only network i've worked for
[01:21:37.880 --> 01:21:42.520]  and i've worked for networks all over the world who came to me before i did my show and said
[01:21:43.160 --> 01:21:48.520]  these are the things you can talk about these are the things you can't talk about uh you unequivocally
[01:21:48.520 --> 01:21:55.400]  cannot mention israel in any context for example the bbc told me point blank a guy named paul gibb
[01:21:55.400 --> 01:22:01.160]  told me that point blank and they had a other list of things that you can and cannot say now no other
[01:22:01.160 --> 01:22:06.360]  network has ever approached me on and done anything like that and rt has been the most
[01:22:06.360 --> 01:22:12.360]  editorially free environment i've ever been involved with and so we they just want to get
[01:22:12.360 --> 01:22:17.240]  the news out there uh you know it's different between being state funded and state directed
[01:22:17.240 --> 01:22:23.000]  you know those uh sony hack so the emails just came out show that the government in the united
[01:22:23.000 --> 01:22:29.560]  states works directly with hollywood sure it's not state run it's state directed exactly it's
[01:22:29.560 --> 01:22:35.400]  a puppeteer operation the russians are open about funding rt the state funded doesn't mean state
[01:22:35.400 --> 01:22:40.680]  directed you know there's no international news organization that's not state funded they're all
[01:22:40.680 --> 01:22:49.160]  state funded bbc rt press tv alga zero and then you have the networks in america are state directed
[01:22:49.160 --> 01:22:55.320]  well and they're state funded cnn msnbc they were all given government satellites they were all given
[01:22:55.320 --> 01:23:00.920]  government support uh they're given government bailout stimulus money they're government funded
[01:23:00.920 --> 01:23:07.320]  come from the government that's the point plus their subsidies but to say for example that rt
[01:23:07.880 --> 01:23:13.720]  has state funding who cares as long as the state's not directing the content which i can tell you
[01:23:13.720 --> 01:23:18.120]  that they're not in my case and i've been there for five years i've done 750 shows i've talked to
[01:23:18.120 --> 01:23:23.800]  every journalist over there the only situation i've seen has been rotten is the one i just described
[01:23:23.800 --> 01:23:27.960]  well since you've told us this on and i remember you mentioning it a few years ago and i was kind of
[01:23:27.960 --> 01:23:32.520]  like you know it's just i mean i know you tell the truth but there's so much i'm like really max

[01:23:37.880 --> 01:23:42.760]  their studios uh yeah now you're saying they want you to stage a defection we ought to find that clip
[01:23:42.760 --> 01:23:48.680]  from like two years ago because this is big news now you bring it up i don't want to break confidence
[01:23:48.680 --> 01:23:55.080]  with our team there's been never any secret discussions i've been in their uh offices in la
[01:23:55.880 --> 01:24:04.680]  i've been uh at their offices uh once in uh dc or outside dc and i was just left the
[01:24:04.680 --> 01:24:08.440]  online talk about whatever i wanted to but i was told by one of their high-level correspondence
[01:24:08.440 --> 01:24:14.680]  and then by one of their major directors i'll leave it at that that the guy that started our team
[01:24:14.680 --> 01:24:18.840]  that actually went to the government and said we got to have our own media is a big listener
[01:24:18.840 --> 01:24:25.080]  the guy that runs you know rt america and then i was told you're not going to be on rt anymore
[01:24:25.080 --> 01:24:30.040]  which isn't that big of a deal because we're already you know have info wars but it was
[01:24:30.040 --> 01:24:35.800]  still creepy the u.s government threatened them to pull their license if they kept having me on
[01:24:36.920 --> 01:24:40.840]  because it freaked them out to have me on every cable system in the country basically yeah every

[01:25:02.040 --> 01:25:07.160]  it's a big threat to see about this hundred million people around the world it's the biggest global
[01:25:07.160 --> 01:25:11.960]  footprint at all well of course i want to come on your show i never even asked but no no i was banned

[01:25:18.120 --> 01:25:23.960]  what's in on listen i went from being on there twice a week to never on there so it's not a rumor
[01:25:24.840 --> 01:25:30.040]  i mean you don't you don't want me to tell the name of the reporters or of the i mean
[01:25:30.040 --> 01:25:36.280]  i i you know i can't say break confidence on that i'm telling you that happened do you believe me
[01:25:37.960 --> 01:25:44.840]  rt america is a subset of rt global i know like i don't really pay much attention to rt america
[01:25:44.840 --> 01:25:51.160]  i was very small comparatively i mean but that's what i'm saying to you rt america i am banned
[01:25:51.160 --> 01:25:58.680]  from rt america well they were having me on twice a week well i well i well i'll extend my invitation
[01:25:58.680 --> 01:26:03.880]  right now okay i'm with the mothership and you can come on anytime you want to as i've always said
[01:26:03.880 --> 01:26:09.400]  whatever subject you want brother i'll come on i come on your show you come on my show that's
[01:26:09.400 --> 01:26:14.920]  the way it's always been for six you five years by the way this wall lady though i mean she is
[01:26:14.920 --> 01:26:20.440]  such a rat and and notice she hasn't even gotten a job since they got her to do this she looks so
[01:26:20.440 --> 01:26:27.400]  upset have you seen that whole testimony well she's unemployed isn't she i mean but eventually
[01:26:27.400 --> 01:26:33.240]  they found a weak link in the chain somebody to to take money ruin their career flush their career
[01:26:33.240 --> 01:26:39.080]  down the toilet and then now she's scrambling uh i know these journalists like armstrong williams
[01:26:39.080 --> 01:26:45.320]  and people don't get you sell out you get caught you you've destroyed yourself i just it's a real
[01:26:45.320 --> 01:26:49.640]  smack in the face to you know actual journalists who are dying out there doing real journalism
[01:26:50.200 --> 01:26:55.720]  michael hastings for example who was killed by the pentagon doing journalism you know in his memory
[01:26:55.720 --> 01:27:02.840]  this this well this wall that you know sells out to to propagandist it's the sad it's a sad day
[01:27:04.440 --> 01:27:10.920]  i want to play a clip of wall calling us cult members isis you name it uh here it is i mean
[01:27:13.240 --> 01:27:16.680]  had a little bit of a glitch there with that computer we'll play it here as soon as they're
[01:27:16.680 --> 01:27:21.880]  ready well let's move on you know i mean there's other stuff to talk about you know no but it is
[01:27:21.880 --> 01:27:27.080]  a big deal i mean i mean it is a big deal that congress is having hearings about shutting down
[01:27:27.080 --> 01:27:32.360]  blogs and comparing us to isis a huge and competitive because rt with you doing actual
[01:27:32.360 --> 01:27:38.680]  journalism is making fox and cnn and rupert murdoch look like the cheap propaganda idiots
[01:27:38.680 --> 01:27:42.440]  that they are and they don't know they don't want to compete they don't want to do their job
[01:27:42.440 --> 01:27:47.560]  you know america this is their thing now it's instead of competing they just bomb you instead of
[01:27:47.560 --> 01:27:52.520]  being putting up journalists they put up brian mcwilliams who lies through his teeth on nbc
[01:27:53.240 --> 01:27:57.640]  they just don't want to compete they're lazy there's just a lazy group of no good have you heard
[01:27:57.640 --> 01:28:08.520]  now the new nbc head wants to bring williams back well he's a known entity of a guy who lies so i
[01:28:08.520 --> 01:28:15.240]  guess that makes him qualified to be an nbc anchor he's a he's a liar so people know that what he's
[01:28:15.240 --> 01:28:21.720]  saying is nonsense and i guess there's a tool for propaganda that makes sense doesn't the
[01:28:21.720 --> 01:28:29.160]  establishment get that it's truth that has power they are afraid out they are afraid they they are
[01:28:29.160 --> 01:28:39.320]  they are afraid that they can't keep this illusion alive forever and that the the the edifice of of
[01:28:39.320 --> 01:28:46.920]  nonsense is crumbling and so they are desperate and and in so doing they're they're losing power
[01:28:46.920 --> 01:28:51.720]  even more rapidly i agree let's go to break now that our tricaster is working with just a short
[01:28:51.720 --> 01:28:59.720]  clip of this benedict arnold reporter uh demonizing blogs here it is and why it's effective i think
[01:28:59.720 --> 01:29:06.520]  you had mentioned that it provides this voice for for fringe voices extremists and it works
[01:29:06.520 --> 01:29:14.040]  because it provides a place for these people a place where these people can congregate and
[01:29:14.040 --> 01:29:19.720]  feed off of each other's biases all right it's almost like a community that is almost like a
[01:29:19.720 --> 01:29:25.400]  cult i would say that's right worldwide you don't want to online and they mobilize and they they
[01:29:25.400 --> 01:29:31.640]  feel like they are part of some enlightened um fight against the establishment we are chump
[01:29:31.640 --> 01:29:38.520]  that they um and they they find a home they find a place where they're heard and we're gonna come
[01:29:38.520 --> 01:29:44.120]  back where she describes us as ices max keiser's our guest i'm alice jones we are real journalism

[01:29:51.880 --> 01:29:57.960]  alice jones and the gcn radio never freedom yeah it's true george washington
[01:29:57.960 --> 01:30:03.640]  pre-crime technology is on the rise and the latest city to adopt this philosophy is miami
[01:30:03.640 --> 01:30:08.520]  florida the miami pd is in the process of planning and adopting hunch lab a predictive policing
[01:30:08.520 --> 01:30:12.840]  system that will be able to produce small maps of where specific crimes occur in the city during
[01:30:12.840 --> 01:30:17.640]  a particular shift miami's hunch lab system will use everything from paydays to school calendars
[01:30:17.640 --> 01:30:22.440]  weather reports and social media this is unlike the crime stat only predpole systems which are in
[01:30:22.440 --> 01:30:28.680]  use in la in atlanta and as we covered in 2013 seattle and tacoma did you know google and the cia
[01:30:28.680 --> 01:30:33.800]  have been working on political pre-crime technology since 2010 they are funding a company recorded

[01:30:38.360 --> 01:30:44.200]  relationships between people organizations actions and incidents in fact in 2010 google and
[01:30:44.200 --> 01:30:48.920]  nqtel injected 10 million dollars into recorded future eight years after the movie minority
[01:30:48.920 --> 01:30:53.160]  report was released predictive programming was already in place for us to accept pre-crime

[01:39:22.840 --> 01:39:32.600]  the internet by turning it into uh hbo or showtime that if you want internet that's not deathly slow
[01:39:32.600 --> 01:39:37.560]  you're going to pay for it and once this happens they balkanize the internet and it's no longer
[01:39:37.560 --> 01:39:42.600]  end end peer to peer anyone can communicate with anyone anywhere in the world uh it becomes
[01:39:42.600 --> 01:39:48.200]  the death of the internet and they therefore are going to eliminate the possibility of the
[01:39:48.200 --> 01:39:53.400]  arab spring or even in baltimore now they're saying that the problem is that people use social
[01:39:53.400 --> 01:39:58.600]  media to communicate they're vilifying social media they're vilifying the ability to communicate
[01:39:58.600 --> 01:40:05.000]  and it's the mpaa and the mpaa was the number one instigator behind erin schwarz's death his
[01:40:05.000 --> 01:40:12.600]  father the federal said erin schwarz was killed by uh chris dodd who runs the mpaa the mpaa
[01:40:12.600 --> 01:40:18.280]  staged the attack on kim dot com in new zealand at jurisdiction that nowhere near los angeles
[01:40:18.280 --> 01:40:23.480]  california and yet they organized a swap team to invade his home arrest him bring him down into
[01:40:23.480 --> 01:40:28.760]  court uh trying to seek extradition for a guy who's never been in the united states never done
[01:40:28.760 --> 01:40:34.120]  business in the united states again that's the mpaa so the mpaa which of course is hollywood and
[01:40:34.120 --> 01:40:39.000]  hollywood has the best propaganda machine in the world people spend billions of dollars every
[01:40:39.000 --> 01:40:45.480]  weekend supporting their cartel of copyright uh that's how in a hillary clinton huge supporters
[01:40:45.480 --> 01:40:51.000]  the mpaa same thing with barack obama and i i predict when barack obama leaves his office
[01:40:51.000 --> 01:40:56.440]  as president he'll he will assume the mantle of leading the mpaa he'll take over from chris dot
[01:40:56.440 --> 01:41:00.840]  they'll be living in los angeles and they'll be lobbying for the copyright cartel so he'll be
[01:41:00.840 --> 01:41:04.440]  the king of the internet he'll be the king of the control internet and of course as you know
[01:41:04.440 --> 01:41:09.880]  they've leaked in the specific trade partnership that one section that just as you say is sopa
[01:41:09.880 --> 01:41:16.520]  and syspal on pcp and steroids it says no judge no jury any big company wants to shut you down
[01:41:17.080 --> 01:41:21.080]  they're claiming that they're going to copyright words where we can't even say them
[01:41:21.080 --> 01:41:24.760]  they're saying they're going to copyright you not being able to put oil in your car
[01:41:24.760 --> 01:41:31.480]  they're using copyright to basically copyright oxygen it's it's it's you they're copywriting our
[01:41:31.480 --> 01:41:37.480]  own genes saying copyright intellectual property to the point where if you use the word microsoft
[01:41:37.480 --> 01:41:40.840]  in an email then at the end of the month you're going to get a bill for microsoft by the way they
[01:41:40.840 --> 01:41:45.960]  said that max you're not exaggerating but i've been i've been saying that for years on your show
[01:41:45.960 --> 01:41:53.400]  but now with the technology and with the ability to perform digital 24 7 invasive pervasive surveillance
[01:41:53.400 --> 01:41:59.320]  and the the cost of a database now to look at every single email and every single voicemail
[01:41:59.320 --> 01:42:03.880]  on the globe every single day now is within reach of the nsa and these other institutions so they
[01:42:03.880 --> 01:42:10.040]  will look at every single thing anyone says does transmit and examine it for copyright abuse and
[01:42:10.040 --> 01:42:14.280]  if you say something that they don't like they'll simply say oh give us ten dollars right now and
[01:42:14.280 --> 01:42:18.200]  if you can't pay we'll lend you ten dollars and five thousand percent at the payday loan shop
[01:42:18.200 --> 01:42:23.880]  or go spend six months in jail and that's the new way i don't want to kiss your butt but on my show
[01:42:23.880 --> 01:42:28.760]  seven years ago it was not just about eight years ago you first started coming on you called it the
[01:42:29.560 --> 01:42:37.080]  casino gulag economy and you said alex people will be debtor prisons and by law they'll have
[01:42:37.080 --> 01:42:42.120]  to play video games all day that then pay them money they got to go out and advertise on other
[01:42:42.120 --> 01:42:47.960]  sites now in the last year that's everywhere now now that's the new job and they have prisoners
[01:42:47.960 --> 01:42:51.880]  i saw an article last month maybe we can pull it up i forget where it was where prisoners
[01:42:51.880 --> 01:42:58.120]  are forced to play video games yeah to make virtual how did you know that how did you know that
[01:42:58.920 --> 01:43:03.880]  because i created something called the hollywood stock exchange which went up against the mpaa in
[01:43:03.880 --> 01:43:09.320]  1996 with my virtual specialist technology they then took over the board of directors
[01:43:09.320 --> 01:43:15.080]  they confiscated 40 million dollars from shareholders led by my co-founder the guy who now
[01:43:15.080 --> 01:43:22.120]  runs line gates film and they made it clear that you cannot and then they outlawed box office
[01:43:22.120 --> 01:43:28.200]  futures contract under chris dot in 2010 so hollywood is the only industry in the world in america i
[01:43:28.200 --> 01:43:33.240]  should say where it's protected that you cannot trade a derivative contract a futures contract
[01:43:33.240 --> 01:43:39.240]  based on box office because they know that every other industry agriculture or industrial
[01:43:39.240 --> 01:43:43.480]  once you introduce financialization and futures contracts you are then giving that industry
[01:43:43.480 --> 01:43:50.200]  way to wall street but hollywood lobbied under chris dot who's now running the mpaa as a senator
[01:43:50.200 --> 01:43:55.960]  dodd he made sure that box office futures were outlawed in 2010 and the quid pro quo was he was
[01:43:55.960 --> 01:44:01.880]  made head of the mpaa so i had a ringside seat into the ugliness of what the copyright cartel
[01:44:01.880 --> 01:44:06.840]  was doing and that's how i knew what was going on but here's the latest development in the past
[01:44:06.840 --> 01:44:12.440]  six months to force you to go online and gamble your life away and live in the casino gulag and
[01:44:12.440 --> 01:44:15.560]  it's the introduction of negative interest rates something i said on your show three years ago
[01:44:15.560 --> 01:44:19.640]  happened everyone laughed at that you can't introduce negative you did yeah and then now
[01:44:19.640 --> 01:44:27.400]  sweden has it um now um they started at first last year switzerland has it it's now spreading
[01:44:27.400 --> 01:44:32.840]  and now they're talking about doing it here max and charging us to use cash or banning it the head
[01:44:32.840 --> 01:44:38.920]  of city has said it the head of jp morgan has said it the war on cash is on and then why are they
[01:44:38.920 --> 01:44:45.960]  hoarding at jp morgan 50 million ounces of silver i i will tell you why and that's a brilliant segue
[01:44:45.960 --> 01:44:52.840]  you're absolutely correct these things are related back in 1933 f dr confiscated gold
[01:44:52.840 --> 01:44:57.080]  if you recall you read your history books after all the gold is confiscated they
[01:44:58.200 --> 01:45:04.280]  priced the dollar down against gold by 60 in an attempt to create inflation to get out of the
[01:45:04.280 --> 01:45:11.320]  depression in the year 2015 it's not practical to go door to door to confiscate gold or silver
[01:45:11.320 --> 01:45:16.600]  so they use paper futures contracts leveraged at a thousand to one to drive the price down
[01:45:16.600 --> 01:45:21.960]  to give jp morgan and other banks around the world the opportunity to buy gold and silver
[01:45:21.960 --> 01:45:28.200]  at these ridiculously low cheap prices until they take total control of these prices and then
[01:45:28.840 --> 01:45:32.920]  in six months or so they'll come out and say no what it's the new world order we need a new
[01:45:32.920 --> 01:45:37.560]  currency grid we need a new britain wood we need a new way to trade these currencies around the
[01:45:37.560 --> 01:45:41.800]  world and guess what they're all going to be based against their value against gold
[01:45:42.360 --> 01:45:47.560]  except not gold at $1200 an ounce gold at $7000 an ounce and is that why all the elites and
[01:45:47.560 --> 01:45:52.600]  universities are hoarding millions of dollars of it while using paper naked shorting to drive down
[01:45:52.600 --> 01:46:00.200]  the price well yes exactly but more importantly that's why china and russia are hoarding gold russia
[01:46:00.200 --> 01:46:06.600]  has just bought another million ounces last month china will come out and my understanding is china
[01:46:06.600 --> 01:46:13.160]  this year will finally disclose for the first time in five six seven years their true gold position
[01:46:13.160 --> 01:46:19.480]  the last official account we have is that china has a thousand and fifty tons of gold the actual
[01:46:19.480 --> 01:46:24.040]  number that's coming to be revealed later this year when all this goes down is that china will
[01:46:24.040 --> 01:46:31.320]  own more than america's position of 8 000 tons therefore china will have the de facto strongest
[01:46:31.320 --> 01:46:36.520]  position in the new currency grid to be introduced which makes sense because they have the world's
[01:46:36.520 --> 01:46:41.560]  biggest economy and they have the worst biggest military and apple computer sells apples and
[01:46:41.560 --> 01:46:47.400]  china and china is kind of taking over larry summers wrote last month that it was basically the
[01:46:47.400 --> 01:46:53.800]  day america blinked and that it was basically the end of our hegemon uh that we went along
[01:46:53.800 --> 01:46:58.440]  with the chinese investment bank that's got all these countries joining it but a lot of the same
[01:46:58.440 --> 01:47:05.880]  insiders are investing in it is that just rhetoric because uh his answer was if we sell out faster to
[01:47:05.880 --> 01:47:11.080]  global governance then we can compete with the chinese what do you think uh summers really
[01:47:11.080 --> 01:47:18.040]  meant by all that hi summers is is a real charlatan and he plays both sides of the fence
[01:47:18.040 --> 01:47:23.960]  brilliantly and he's a survivor but he has to speak with fork tongue uh almost everything he's a
[01:47:23.960 --> 01:47:29.400]  duplicitous king but what's happening is that china and russia have started their own bank to
[01:47:29.400 --> 01:47:33.880]  compete with the world bank and the international monetary fund and they got strategically britain
[01:47:33.880 --> 01:47:40.840]  to sign on and this really got america upset but britain signed on so now you have the setup for
[01:47:40.840 --> 01:47:45.720]  the dollar to lose this place as world reserve currency uh i ran and russia just announced
[01:47:45.720 --> 01:47:50.680]  that they're going to start doing deals in the ruble uh the fall of the dollar as world reserve
[01:47:50.680 --> 01:47:55.880]  currency is a trend that's irreversible and the only thing keeping the dollar alive today is that
[01:47:55.880 --> 01:48:01.560]  america is buying its own sovereign debt which is something that can't last forever because it's a
[01:48:01.560 --> 01:48:07.000]  Ponzi scheme china up until six months ago was america's biggest creditor now japan which is a
[01:48:07.000 --> 01:48:11.720]  vassal state of america is america's biggest creditor so you think the trends we've been
[01:48:11.720 --> 01:48:16.120]  talking about for years are coming to fruition but underneath all this some of the things we
[01:48:16.120 --> 01:48:20.440]  have been predicting like negative interest rates and playing casino games for cash and
[01:48:20.440 --> 01:48:25.160]  these things have come true so i want to reiterate that these predictions we've made
[01:48:25.160 --> 01:48:31.720]  are coming true remember conspiracy theory is the term that the cabal uses to discredit
[01:48:31.720 --> 01:48:37.720]  investigative journalism well that was declassified that in the 60s the cia coined the term and
[01:48:37.720 --> 01:48:43.720]  directed major news organizations to use it then in 1993 the clinton library just released this
[01:48:43.720 --> 01:48:49.560]  four months ago we had joseph farron some of its so incendiary farrah hasn't even released it yet
[01:48:49.560 --> 01:48:54.760]  it's so damning and so destructive but they're they're they're working with lawyers right now
[01:48:54.760 --> 01:49:00.120]  but it was how to block the independent media being born how to buy it off how to shut it down
[01:49:00.120 --> 01:49:06.520]  they were fearing it then and they said we must go back to the cia plan to call them conspiracy
[01:49:06.520 --> 01:49:12.120]  theorist we must not allow the people to ever have a choice i mean those memos are sickening have
[01:49:12.120 --> 01:49:18.760]  you read those no no but no i haven't seen it but anytime anyone hears the word conspiracy theory
[01:49:18.760 --> 01:49:26.440]  know that it's code for investigative journalism or questioning known liars yeah it's just anything
[01:49:26.440 --> 01:49:31.880]  that's investigated journalism in american media is referred to as a conspiracy let me ask you a
[01:49:31.880 --> 01:49:37.240]  question why do you think ap reporters and others were targeted and attacked by police in baltimore
[01:49:37.240 --> 01:49:43.320]  but then they were ordered to stand down with the looters what is the plan there well ap what was
[01:49:43.320 --> 01:49:47.400]  exactly the story repeat that again well i mean they just attack our reporters other reporters
[01:49:47.400 --> 01:49:53.240]  all over just they won't stop the looters but they attack reporters well that's the that's a
[01:49:53.240 --> 01:49:59.160]  trend that's been happening for a while now they are making filming police the criminal offense
[01:49:59.160 --> 01:50:02.920]  they don't want any record of any of the transgressions that the violence in the police
[01:50:02.920 --> 01:50:08.120]  departments across the country are escalating quite rapidly and uh as you know they've become
[01:50:08.120 --> 01:50:14.760]  milit militarized in the u.s so journalism is there to record this and so they got to get
[01:50:14.760 --> 01:50:21.640]  rid of that they don't want any record of the police acting as a military force for the claptocrats
[01:50:21.640 --> 01:50:27.160]  do they yeah but i mean there are some problems with the police max but from the numbers i've
[01:50:27.160 --> 01:50:33.720]  seen police violence is flat doesn't mean it's not horrible uh but why will they not stop the looters
[01:50:33.720 --> 01:50:37.880]  but they'll attack reporters is what i'm saying i mean have you seen the clip with the mayor saying
[01:50:37.880 --> 01:50:43.960]  we let him riot i'm learning all that from your show today because i don't i don't really follow

[01:54:23.240 --> 01:54:32.760]  when they tell the truth but big global institutions themselves have a very clear agenda for planetary
[01:54:32.760 --> 01:54:37.880]  domination that's taking place and individual freedom is not in the equation it's being targeted
[01:54:37.880 --> 01:54:43.000]  max kaiser's agreed to stay with us to take calls and take twitter questions 20 minutes into the next
[01:54:43.000 --> 01:54:49.720]  hour there's a very powerful article at zero hedge today that we posted at info wars dot com
[01:54:49.720 --> 01:54:56.280]  the baltimore riots the stunning comments by orioles owners son who is the vice president
[01:54:56.280 --> 01:55:02.360]  i want to read these later after max has left us but it really uh breaks it all down have you
[01:55:02.360 --> 01:55:07.560]  just joined us again max keiser is our guest max keiser dot com is his site you can follow him by
[01:55:07.560 --> 01:55:13.000]  linking through on his twitter there as well uh max i want to go ahead and go to scott adam dan john
[01:55:13.000 --> 01:55:19.800]  and others as we're ready in this hour at least you get one call in but we live in this fantasy land
[01:55:20.840 --> 01:55:26.520]  where every economic indicator shows the world's going into depression but they tell us it's a boom
[01:55:26.520 --> 01:55:30.760]  town but then a month ago all the economic numbers came out and said we're in trouble
[01:55:30.760 --> 01:55:34.600]  but then they had new numbers that came out that said everything's great what is the real
[01:55:34.600 --> 01:55:42.200]  economic status of the planet and how fast are we drifting into depression well the way that the
[01:55:42.200 --> 01:55:48.600]  economy is measured from the people who say it's doing great they look at the price of stock and
[01:55:48.600 --> 01:55:55.320]  they look at the price of houses and these things are trading up and they're at record high
[01:55:55.320 --> 01:56:05.240]  why is that is because the central banks around the world in an attempt to stimulate growth
[01:56:05.800 --> 01:56:12.200]  starting six or seven years ago embarked on a radical program of zero percent interest rates
[01:56:12.200 --> 01:56:20.360]  to try to create some inflation and by inflation we're talking about some wage inflation to get
[01:56:20.360 --> 01:56:26.840]  people's wages so that they were making more than the price of groceries and petrol etc but
[01:56:26.840 --> 01:56:33.000]  what's happened over these six or seven years is that the people whose wages were hopefully going
[01:56:33.000 --> 01:56:39.720]  to start to go up they never went up in fact wages have been going down but all that money
[01:56:39.720 --> 01:56:46.280]  that they printed to try to get that to happen went somewhere where did it go it went into the
[01:56:46.280 --> 01:56:54.760]  pockets of the very very top who used it to buy stocks and property and so that the failure of
[01:56:54.760 --> 01:57:00.360]  mainstream media is to look at both sides of the coin because typically if you if you watch
[01:57:00.360 --> 01:57:05.800]  certainly financial media like CNBC they'll just all day long they'll say stocks are record high
[01:57:05.800 --> 01:57:10.200]  that's great and if you're not a new if you haven't doubled your net worth in the last six months
[01:57:10.200 --> 01:57:15.320]  like the top 1,000 richest people in the uk did in the last six years then it's because you're not
[01:57:15.320 --> 01:57:20.920]  working hard enough it's because you're a loser but that's not true in fact the reality is that
[01:57:20.920 --> 01:57:25.720]  the central banks have re-engineered the global economy in such a way where the money that they
[01:57:25.720 --> 01:57:32.360]  print never goes into increasing wages because they don't need people this fundamentally this is
[01:57:32.360 --> 01:57:37.640]  a shift that's happened in the last 20 25 years is that the idea of paying down debt in a country
[01:57:37.640 --> 01:57:43.240]  like america from the tax revenue from workers making money and making more money and increased
[01:57:43.240 --> 01:57:51.240]  wages has become obsolete the wealth is no longer generated by people who own productive
[01:57:52.120 --> 01:57:57.800]  companies it's generated through counterfeit derivatives fraud and other subsets and now
[01:57:57.800 --> 01:58:01.720]  the elite believe they're going to have robots to service them so why are humans even needed
[01:58:01.720 --> 01:58:05.480]  they're truly delusional even though the one in guardian had to report on something we talked
[01:58:05.480 --> 01:58:11.160]  about a decade ago how they're building command bases and armored redoubts in new zealand so the
[01:58:11.160 --> 01:58:16.760]  elite like you called them suicide bankers are destroying the world so they can sit on the ash
[01:58:16.760 --> 01:58:21.480]  heap we're going to go to break with max keiser and come back and go right to scott adam dan john

[02:00:29.800 --> 02:00:37.720]  and video of an aarp had with subliminal martial law announcements well you guys pull a couple of
[02:00:37.720 --> 02:00:43.000]  the other latest subliminal stuff we've covered the last few months i was usually attacking
[02:00:43.000 --> 02:00:48.840]  info wars i mean it's getting crazy so that's coming up let's go to calls for max kaiser
[02:00:48.840 --> 02:00:55.800]  at maxkaiser.com scott in washington thanks for holding your on the air thanks for putting me
[02:00:55.800 --> 02:01:04.280]  on first alex i'm going to say hi to max kaiser because i really appreciate his grasp on the economy
[02:01:04.280 --> 02:01:12.520]  but my question for max is stepping outside of the systems of monetary policy all over the globe
[02:01:12.520 --> 02:01:20.600]  we have monetary policy in governments that are oppressing us they're enslaving us
[02:01:20.600 --> 02:01:27.560]  because they have the control of issuance of credit and currency that you still play with
[02:01:27.560 --> 02:01:34.680]  as a capitalist now first i have to say the capitalist using currency issued at interest
[02:01:34.680 --> 02:01:41.080]  is one of the worst representations of a capitalist in my opinion i have a question of
[02:01:41.800 --> 02:01:49.800]  how do you suggest we step outside of these systems that divide us using currency i know
[02:01:49.800 --> 02:01:54.840]  what he says to say use cryptocurrencies like like bitcoin but i think it goes further having a
[02:01:54.840 --> 02:02:01.080]  garden going and buying stuff from amish buying from local shops voting with your dollars is a way
[02:02:01.080 --> 02:02:06.760]  to actually use their fraudulent currency and i think being in their system but acting wisely
[02:02:06.760 --> 02:02:13.160]  within it is the surest way to change it but also working outside of it at the same time
[02:02:13.160 --> 02:02:18.600]  i think it's a multifaceted attack profile max kaiser what do you say well i like the idea of
[02:02:18.600 --> 02:02:25.960]  using the tools of the enemy against them and so two things you said go after coca-cola like five
[02:02:25.960 --> 02:02:30.440]  years ago they're in trouble uh we've now got mcdonald's in trouble sorry we'll talk about that in
[02:02:30.440 --> 02:02:36.440]  the next segment yeah well i'm that that idea of boycotting companies while selling this the stock
[02:02:36.440 --> 02:02:43.880]  short which at the time i called karma bank i'm relaunching that with hopefully with russell brand
[02:02:43.880 --> 02:02:48.920]  here in the united kingdom it's going to be called the true boycott hedge fund and we're starting to
[02:02:48.920 --> 02:02:54.360]  put that back in place now so it was you boycott a company and the stock goes down the hedge fund
[02:02:54.360 --> 02:03:00.120]  makes money by making negative bets against that stock and then we'll do things like use the profits
[02:03:00.120 --> 02:03:06.120]  to retire student debt or fund you know the victims of coca-cola or the victims of mcdonald's
[02:03:06.120 --> 02:03:11.240]  etc the second way i'm doing i'm doing it and i sent nico the link is i'm also starting another
[02:03:11.240 --> 02:03:17.800]  hedge fund again the idea is to use the tools against the guys who are doing the most damage
[02:03:17.800 --> 02:03:26.120]  and this is called bitcoin capital it's another fund it's at bitcoin capital dot i o is the address
[02:03:26.120 --> 02:03:31.560]  for it and i'm raising a million dollars for this new fund and it's going to be used to invest in
[02:03:31.560 --> 02:03:36.280]  cryptocurrency and cryptocurrency mining so people listen we've had russell brand on many times i
[02:03:36.280 --> 02:03:40.280]  know he's a friend of yours he's a listener of ours we've met with him here in austin but i want to
[02:03:40.280 --> 02:03:44.520]  get you both on when you launch that to help promote it because i want to get fully behind that
[02:03:44.520 --> 02:03:52.760]  man i tell you isn't russell brand an imposing person in person he's a he's a he's a superstar
[02:03:52.760 --> 02:03:59.240]  and you know he's got the goods to really lead a political movement in in the united kingdom and
[02:03:59.240 --> 02:04:05.000]  around the world he just did a fantastic talk about independent media his truce is now bigger
[02:04:05.000 --> 02:04:10.360]  than the sun newspaper here in the uk he just had ed milleban who's could quite possibly be the
[02:04:10.360 --> 02:04:14.360]  country's prime minister next week he just interviewed him on his independent podcast of truce
[02:04:15.000 --> 02:04:21.720]  today so he's emerging as an enormously influential political figure in the united kingdom he's got
[02:04:21.720 --> 02:04:27.000]  followers all over the world and we're fortunate to be able to do some things with him we're crowd
[02:04:27.000 --> 02:04:33.240]  funding his truce cafes we're doing that all around london we've crowdfunded some scratch cards
[02:04:33.240 --> 02:04:38.840]  we give away we give away crypto to people for free the stock coin which what i created last year
[02:04:38.840 --> 02:04:43.880]  we have we we have a deal with russell well we just give him away free it's very exciting i tell you
[02:04:43.880 --> 02:04:48.600]  in person i've been around a lot of famous people he's got a very strong presence uh he's a good
[02:04:48.600 --> 02:04:53.720]  guy and he's a listener he says we help wake him up so i'm proud to see his transformation uh yeah
[02:04:53.720 --> 02:04:57.080]  and i like to think he said katie perry was a listener i know her dad's been on
[02:04:57.080 --> 02:05:04.040]  i was born on the prairies where the wind blew free and there was nothing to break the light
[02:05:04.040 --> 02:05:10.840]  of the sun i was born where there were no enclosures dironimo i wonder what he thinks of the permanent
[02:05:10.840 --> 02:05:16.200]  checkpoints where you're quizzed about your citizenship about having to submit to bag searches
[02:05:16.200 --> 02:05:21.720]  to ride public transportation his thoughts on nonviolent offenders riding away in prisons
[02:05:21.720 --> 02:05:28.200]  they say that in these current times we are more quote civilized but are we really more free
[02:05:28.200 --> 02:05:34.120]  when the persian army demanded king leonidus and his Spartans surrender their arms the outnumbered
[02:05:34.120 --> 02:05:39.880]  king shouted molon lobby or come and take them even though leonidus was eventually defeated by a
[02:05:39.880 --> 02:05:45.560]  much larger adversary he is not remembered for his loss he lives in history as a beacon of
[02:05:45.560 --> 02:05:51.800]  defiance and self-defense the desire to disarm the people is nothing new arm yourself with

[02:08:08.600 --> 02:08:18.600]  defending the republic from enemies foreign and domestic it's alex jones
[02:08:23.160 --> 02:08:27.960]  surely before his death martin looser king had this to say and it's the reason they killed him
[02:08:27.960 --> 02:08:35.080]  he wanted peace and the power structure wanted violence to discredit here it is i feel that killing
[02:08:35.080 --> 02:08:42.920]  is a very tragic way to deal with any social problem there is no violent solution to the
[02:08:42.920 --> 02:08:49.080]  problem that the negro confronts in this country and this is why i have constantly said that riots
[02:08:49.080 --> 02:08:56.680]  are socially destructive and self-defeating after all the negro ends up on the losing end
[02:08:56.680 --> 02:09:02.200]  we can't win a violent revolution most of the persons killed in riots and negroes themselves
[02:09:02.200 --> 02:09:09.080]  the persons who end up not being able to get milk for their children of negroes because
[02:09:09.080 --> 02:09:16.120]  things where they have to live are destroyed so there's no practical or moral answer in the realm
[02:09:16.120 --> 02:09:23.960]  of violence to the negroes problem that's martin looser king and now we again have the big push
[02:09:24.760 --> 02:09:29.080]  four more violence in the justice department to save us we're going to have some breaking news on
[02:09:29.080 --> 02:09:33.400]  that coming up in the next segment right now we're taking calls from max keiser i have some
[02:09:33.400 --> 02:09:37.160]  twitter questions uh here that we're going to get to in a moment as well but let's move quickly
[02:09:37.160 --> 02:09:41.880]  the calls uh let's talk to john in new jersey thanks for holding john you're on the air
[02:09:43.080 --> 02:09:49.320]  hi max i'm wondering i have most of my money in an ira but i'd like to probably get it out
[02:09:49.320 --> 02:09:54.600]  i don't know where to send my money i'm so scared about the united states uh and putting it in one
[02:09:54.600 --> 02:10:00.920]  of these uh funds and gold like peter schiff suggests or uh i don't know where to even diversify
[02:10:00.920 --> 02:10:04.440]  you can't get things to rush if you wanted to put it into rubles what do you do instead of the
[02:10:04.440 --> 02:10:13.080]  singapore lictus pine i don't know where where you think the best avenues of diversifying if there
[02:10:13.080 --> 02:10:20.920]  is a collapse a real collapse well uh you know sometimes i defer to people who i think are really
[02:10:20.920 --> 02:10:26.200]  really quite competent in answering some of these questions i'll give you two answers the first one
[02:10:26.200 --> 02:10:31.240]  is that if you look up a guy named doug casey i think he's been on your show alex a couple of
[02:10:31.240 --> 02:10:36.040]  times sure doug casey i want to get him back on yeah the internationalist or the internationalist
[02:10:36.040 --> 02:10:44.600]  living and he's fantastic at really diving into how to diversify and how to invest and how to escape
[02:10:44.600 --> 02:10:51.800]  you know being uh caught up in in one location and and uh not able to get any freedom at all
[02:10:51.800 --> 02:10:55.160]  the second thing i'll point out i just heard this is kind of an interesting story is that you
[02:10:55.160 --> 02:10:59.320]  know the dollar right now is going up because the derivative markets and everything's priced
[02:10:59.320 --> 02:11:05.560]  in derivatives as the derivative markets are being shut down because of this global deflation
[02:11:05.560 --> 02:11:11.320]  problem the there's actually a rush to buy us dollars because they're priced in dollars and
[02:11:11.320 --> 02:11:16.040]  they're the big institutional players need to buy dollars at some point when that ends
[02:11:16.040 --> 02:11:21.560]  then the dollar collapses and the way to play this on both sides is the hong kong dollar because the
[02:11:21.560 --> 02:11:25.400]  hong kong dollar is actually pegged to the us dollar so you get the you get the ride on the
[02:11:25.400 --> 02:11:31.320]  way up and then when the dollar peaks out it starts to crash and china unpags the hong kong dollar
[02:11:31.320 --> 02:11:36.920]  from the us i was about to say it's a dangerous game if you're not an expert but you can ride the
[02:11:36.920 --> 02:11:41.960]  expanding stock markets you can ride the other currencies if you're an expert in doing it every
[02:11:41.960 --> 02:11:48.760]  day uh i understand this stuff but i don't even try to do it because it's so dangerous is a fantastic
[02:11:48.760 --> 02:11:53.640]  resource for this that he really gets into the nuts and bolts of it and uh that's who you know
[02:11:53.640 --> 02:12:00.520]  might go to guy who is again doug casey c a s e y sure sure i knew you said doug casey i was just
[02:12:00.520 --> 02:12:06.040]  talking over you might have said somebody else who else do you like to listen to well it's for
[02:12:06.040 --> 02:12:13.240]  the individual who was looking for solutions i think doug is a is a great guy but uh broadly
[02:12:13.240 --> 02:12:19.080]  speaking i listen to the same guys that you listen to mark fauber uh peter chef you know these guys
[02:12:19.080 --> 02:12:29.080]  are i think are clued in and uh at the moment we're all kind of uh on the receiving end of this
[02:12:29.080 --> 02:12:38.200]  enormous uh uh market failure driven by the central banks themselves just buying all the bonds that
[02:12:38.200 --> 02:12:44.680]  they themselves are issuing and and that is a definition of a policy scheme and it exactly
[02:12:44.680 --> 02:12:50.840]  when that breaks you know that nobody knows for sure but it's not a healthy situation so being
[02:12:50.840 --> 02:12:56.360]  prepared ahead of time though makes sense well it certainly does and there's different strategies
[02:12:56.360 --> 02:13:02.040]  you can be a prepper have a low level job small place out in the country develop your own economy
[02:13:02.040 --> 02:13:07.800]  meet a lot of people you know work in a machine shop uh work with the amish just become self-sufficient
[02:13:07.800 --> 02:13:12.040]  that's one survival model then there's learn how everything works manipulate the globalist own
[02:13:12.040 --> 02:13:18.040]  system because an internationalist is not a globalist an internationalist knows how to go
[02:13:18.040 --> 02:13:23.320]  from country to country and use the diversity for security and profit the globalists want to end
[02:13:23.320 --> 02:13:29.880]  any real diversity end country firewalls and create a systematic corporate global fascist
[02:13:29.880 --> 02:13:36.120]  governance worldwide max you think that's a uh accurate uh definition yeah that's a good point
[02:13:36.120 --> 02:13:41.880]  uh the internationalist as Doug Casey describes it he would have a company registered in one country
[02:13:41.880 --> 02:13:46.840]  a passport in a second country and live in a third country and this way you've got some protection
[02:13:46.840 --> 02:13:51.000]  against the globalist you know the people who want to introduce one world government
[02:13:51.000 --> 02:13:56.600]  and shut down territories one by one you want to be able to try to stay one step ahead of that
[02:13:56.600 --> 02:14:00.920]  and the way that he describes it and and he's been around for many years i actually used to
[02:14:00.920 --> 02:14:06.360]  read his research 25 years ago he's the guy's a long long time he's like bill Chapman almost
[02:14:06.360 --> 02:14:12.360]  he's like been around for 40 years uh and you know he's just he's a veteran and a lot of people
[02:14:12.360 --> 02:14:16.920]  don't follow him because he's just been like part of the landscape but for the people in the know
[02:14:16.920 --> 02:14:23.640]  i think his insights are extremely valuable absolutely i don't have guests on this show
[02:14:23.640 --> 02:14:30.760]  unless they're been accurate like 90 of the time and you turn into msnbc or cnbc it's like 90
[02:14:30.760 --> 02:14:36.600]  inaccurate it's not that they're even stupid they have a script to feed their victims and i will not
[02:14:36.600 --> 02:14:40.360]  be part of victimizing my audience and you won't either i think that's what it comes down to it's
[02:14:40.360 --> 02:14:45.080]  not like we're angels or something but man i'm not knocking old ladies in the head max and i'm
[02:14:45.080 --> 02:14:50.920]  telling you that's what CNN and others are doing yeah well a quick correction i said bill i meant
[02:14:50.920 --> 02:14:57.400]  bob bob Chapman of course uh just to honor the the memory of bob who is an international forecaster
[02:14:57.400 --> 02:15:03.640]  yeah great great great guest on your show but uh you know i agree with you uh but i i think that
[02:15:03.640 --> 02:15:10.360]  was we were talking earlier how the u.s government through things like the voice of america and the
[02:15:10.360 --> 02:15:16.840]  broadcasting board of governors is panicking into kind of revealing the fact that they have nothing
[02:15:16.840 --> 02:15:22.520]  to offer through their media outlets other than to try to discredit legitimate news and their numbers
[02:15:22.520 --> 02:15:27.640]  are going down to almost nothing we're almost reaching a singularity i don't know what they're
[02:15:27.640 --> 02:15:32.680]  going to do i mean they're going to come after us and then that will only make us heroes it's just
[02:15:32.680 --> 02:15:36.920]  amazing but it's going to be one hell of a fight folks i mean they're not down believe me let's
[02:15:36.920 --> 02:15:44.840]  talk to adam in california you're on here with max geyser hello alex and max welcome it's adam from
[02:15:44.840 --> 02:15:51.880]  san diego welcome to wamp go ahead go ahead hey alex it's adam from no more news uh i did this
[02:15:51.880 --> 02:15:56.520]  subliminal piece from comedy central that's right you found them subliminally attacking info wars
[02:15:56.520 --> 02:16:01.400]  there's a lot of examples of that yeah they're they're over the top tons of examples and it's
[02:16:01.400 --> 02:16:05.000]  so important you guys are talking about the conspiracy theory term because it's the most
[02:16:05.000 --> 02:16:09.960]  powerful tool the establishment uses to keep the masses in a trance there's no question liz wal was
[02:16:09.960 --> 02:16:14.680]  talking about you in that press conference and there's a whole campaign out to get you i posted
[02:16:14.680 --> 02:16:20.600]  them the uh documentary i created on info wars on friday and they played it 10 minutes on the radio
[02:16:20.600 --> 02:16:24.440]  and it's alex jones versus the mainstream media i was wondering you're out all week did you see it
[02:16:24.440 --> 02:16:30.840]  i did watch it yes i did watch it i downloaded it and watched it on a plane ride so good job
[02:16:30.840 --> 02:16:35.640]  thank you for defending me because because if i don't get defended the rest of media the new
[02:16:35.640 --> 02:16:39.800]  media won't get defended if they can take me down they can take everybody down and who they talk about
[02:16:39.800 --> 02:16:45.000]  is drudge and alex jones and if they can knock those two things down then they can get the max
[02:16:45.000 --> 02:16:48.760]  geysers and everybody else it doesn't mean i'm perfect doesn't mean drudge is perfect it just
[02:16:48.760 --> 02:16:54.520]  means that they can take me down they can take everybody down uh and and max geyser i know you're
[02:16:54.520 --> 02:17:00.280]  getting attacked as well they are really coming after me what do you think that signifies oh i
[02:17:00.280 --> 02:17:05.160]  i think this is my own strategy is that uh i'm not going to get worried until they come after you
[02:17:05.160 --> 02:17:10.040]  alex as long as you're still alive i know i'm safe so uh you keep doing what you're doing
[02:17:10.040 --> 02:17:14.280]  and uh you know that old joke about how to how do you run away from a bear you don't have to run
[02:17:14.280 --> 02:17:18.440]  away from the bear just run away from the guy who's you're with just as long as you're faster than
[02:17:18.440 --> 02:17:24.280]  that guy you'll be safe well i mean let's be clear if they kill me or set me up i knew what i was doing
[02:17:24.280 --> 02:17:29.000]  i still win i mean let's be clear obi wonk and obi knew he's walking up against arth vader uh
[02:17:29.000 --> 02:17:33.960]  be very kind at your memorial service there's no doubt and then uh sounds like a long vacation
[02:17:33.960 --> 02:17:39.560]  over niko and we're going i'll probably show up in austin the next day you know carpik baggin
[02:17:39.560 --> 02:17:45.560]  be like oh alex joe he was a great guy stay right next door we got another show coming up
[02:17:45.560 --> 02:17:50.440]  you know we're just gonna swoop right in i hope people swoop right in if they get me but the
[02:17:50.440 --> 02:17:55.320]  point is they are coming after us which shows what we're talking about really scares them and so i
[02:17:55.320 --> 02:18:01.960]  see this as the proof of success uh adam real quick what's your question for max my question for max
[02:18:01.960 --> 02:18:07.480]  is the financial system is a scam we print money from nothing can the money masters just keep
[02:18:07.480 --> 02:18:12.920]  printing money forever until we have just like you know that's right how long does this delusional
[02:18:12.920 --> 02:18:19.400]  economy go it's never gone this long not in zimbabwe not in weimar germany how long can alison
[02:18:19.400 --> 02:18:27.960]  wonderland tea party continue until russia and china say that's enough is enough and they
[02:18:27.960 --> 02:18:33.640]  introduce a gold back currency all right thank you adam let's jam in one more two more john

[02:19:06.440 --> 02:19:11.560]  asking about your claim of being the white bruce lee i thought that would be more you know questionable
[02:19:11.560 --> 02:19:15.880]  i didn't mean it as an insult i meant i was good looking like bruce lee
[02:19:18.040 --> 02:19:23.720]  yeah i know that's bad that's uh me too you kind of look like bruce lee actually
[02:19:24.440 --> 02:19:30.520]  yeah you know that bruce lee is the man you know but bruce lee bruce lee meets kermit the frog
[02:19:30.520 --> 02:19:36.120]  that equals max keiser you're saying you you were the one time to white bruce lee i'm thinking damn
[02:19:36.120 --> 02:19:41.880]  that hey chuck norris is a daily listener and he says he could clean the floor with bruce lee and
[02:19:41.880 --> 02:19:47.240]  he fought him in what was the movie where he fights him to the death and was it that to the dragon
[02:19:47.240 --> 02:19:53.080]  into the dragon yes yeah well you know nobody beats chuck norris chuck norris is uh you know
[02:19:53.080 --> 02:20:01.000]  he's the man but anyway when we when he coming on my show big daddy uh big you tell my big big
[02:20:01.000 --> 02:20:07.080]  chuck norris no you know you know you the white i will come on the white devil will come on whenever

[02:20:13.400 --> 02:20:20.520]  seriously uh schmini just hung up oh no no he's still on he lied and said his name is john okay
[02:20:20.520 --> 02:20:26.200]  no schmini claims he's a liberal uh i i don't think what modern liberals are even liberals
[02:20:26.200 --> 02:20:31.160]  but max keiser is definitely not a conservative he's like an internationalist libertarian
[02:20:31.160 --> 02:20:36.760]  probably you call him liberal schmini why are you john calling schmini calling himself john
[02:20:37.800 --> 02:20:42.200]  why on earth are you lying to the white bruce lee right now
[02:20:44.360 --> 02:20:49.800]  well sir um actually i don't know if your guest knows this but if he's taken any uh
[02:20:49.800 --> 02:20:56.360]  uh looks at those pictures that you put out of uh you lifting weights and posing you are
[02:20:57.160 --> 02:21:01.880]  you're just fabulous looking bruce if bruce lee doesn't do you justice you're like a bruce lee
[02:21:02.600 --> 02:21:09.800]  slash arnold schwarzenegger and but now you kind of look like uh i don't know uh well you posted
[02:21:09.800 --> 02:21:14.920]  some more pictures with you of your shirt off and uh even though you're not quite job of the hut
[02:21:14.920 --> 02:21:19.720]  you're still pretty fat turd my friend you have a long way to go before you could call yourself
[02:21:19.720 --> 02:21:24.760]  no i mean i've got a little bit of belly fat when i'm you know got my clothes off and i've lost a ton
[02:21:24.760 --> 02:21:29.240]  away i have a big head maybe you're talking about that uh but let's not get off into a discussion
[02:21:29.240 --> 02:21:33.880]  about alex jones i'm just trying to get in that shape i'm not trying to be a beauty queen here
[02:21:33.880 --> 02:21:37.880]  and i was just talking about what supplementation has done for me so do you want to add how many
[02:21:37.880 --> 02:21:45.640]  of them attacks you have a question for max keiser um i have a question for max keiser um i guess
[02:21:45.640 --> 02:21:51.080]  i'll just make one up i really called in to just uh make fun of you alex jones and all of your wing
[02:21:51.080 --> 02:21:59.640]  nut psycho listeners but uh i'm wondering why uh max keiser is uh directing people to uh buy
[02:22:00.520 --> 02:22:05.640]  silver and gold and things like that when nobody can even spend it no matter what happens
[02:22:05.640 --> 02:22:10.280]  how are you going to spend a bunch of pieces of silver if there's an economic collapse it just
[02:22:10.280 --> 02:22:15.800]  it's not really shows how ignorant this guy is max yeah max why does why does jp morgan been buying
[02:22:15.800 --> 02:22:21.640]  it at record levels and just bought 50 million ounces of physical why are the chinese and russians
[02:22:21.640 --> 02:22:27.080]  in the university of texas and the u.s government buying it as fast as they can why why are indians
[02:22:27.080 --> 02:22:32.360]  buying it why are chinese commoners buying it why these are horrible people as the globe accelerates
[02:22:32.360 --> 02:22:38.120]  a currency devaluation race i mean that'd be like zing zimbabweans should have bought gold or silver
[02:22:38.120 --> 02:22:42.760]  20 years ago of course i think the question is if the question is i hear the question many times
[02:22:42.760 --> 02:22:47.960]  in other words uh you you know it's also this question you can't eat gold you know you can't
[02:22:47.960 --> 02:22:53.160]  what what value is it if there's a collapse what value does the gold it's true you can only wipe your
[02:22:53.160 --> 02:22:58.200]  butt with paper yeah this is this is a question that comes up over and over again and the answer
[02:22:58.200 --> 02:23:04.680]  is is a couple of answers first of all as as something no one is ever going to not take your
[02:23:04.680 --> 02:23:11.560]  gold in an emergency if there is an emergency there certainly looks like a financial systems are
[02:23:11.560 --> 02:23:17.720]  under a great deal of stress again and banks are shut down as they have been like cyprus they had
[02:23:17.720 --> 02:23:22.600]  their wealth confiscated the greek banks are under almost completely bankrupt uh the in france you
[02:23:22.600 --> 02:23:28.280]  can't take out more than a thousand euros uh on any one trip or one week if they're clamping down
[02:23:28.280 --> 02:23:34.600]  they're introducing capital controls so if you have therefore gold and and and you let's say
[02:23:35.400 --> 02:23:40.840]  need to make a purchase over a thousand euros or you need to get out of the country or you need
[02:23:40.840 --> 02:23:46.200]  medical help or you need an emergency help nobody is not going to take your gold gold has always
[02:23:46.200 --> 02:23:50.840]  been accepted as a means of exchange you can always cash it in when they've devalued a currency
[02:23:50.840 --> 02:23:56.520]  for even more of the currency so that you can then use that it's liquid it's portable let me ask
[02:23:56.520 --> 02:24:02.680]  let me ask smithy something smithy smithy smithy smithy why are you people so against any other

[02:25:58.120 --> 02:26:03.160]  looking to change their name to try to escape the their legacy of being a predatory monopolist
[02:26:03.160 --> 02:26:09.480]  and lender in scoundrel mcdonald's is starting to go bankrupt coca cola's in trouble i mean all these
[02:26:09.480 --> 02:26:13.400]  and again these are the folks that are funding anti-gun initiatives open borders i mean the
[02:26:13.400 --> 02:26:19.080]  globalists are pretty easy to beat max if we just decide we can beat them that's exactly right and
[02:26:19.080 --> 02:26:24.840]  you know your show with anyone tells me that oh alex jones is the stuff is uh far out i say give
[02:26:24.840 --> 02:26:31.000]  it 18 months it most most 80 percent of everything you think sounds crazy in 18 months it becomes
[02:26:31.000 --> 02:26:36.520]  part of the public record what about the other 20 though max the other the other the other
[02:26:36.520 --> 02:26:41.560]  percentages like you know falls into the category of the you know the white roose lee claim which i'm
[02:26:41.560 --> 02:26:47.400]  still having trouble wrapping my mind around well it's called a joke if i i get it i mean we
[02:26:47.400 --> 02:26:52.680]  gotta have a little fun here i mean it's very poetic but when i joke around it's a joke it's
[02:26:52.680 --> 02:26:58.680]  pretty obvious now when i was at your uh facilities the truth is i beat up the truth is i beat up
[02:26:58.680 --> 02:27:05.720]  check norris okay it's true he run wild in the warehouse and i was able to run away with several
[02:27:05.720 --> 02:27:11.960]  t-shirts that i wear with great pride around london the molon lobby uh info wars if you see
[02:27:11.960 --> 02:27:16.600]  somebody in london wearing these shirts that's me because i think the info war is is the best
[02:27:17.560 --> 02:27:23.640]  that in democracy now are the only two journalistic outlets in the u.s well what's amazing max we
[02:27:23.640 --> 02:27:27.720]  appreciate that max keiser dot com is i did take the family sports fishing and i haven't taken
[02:27:27.720 --> 02:27:31.720]  them on a vacation like a year because we were rained out had family stuff going on during
[02:27:31.720 --> 02:27:38.760]  spring breaks we didn't go i went to cancun and went to illa maharis and i literally had almost
[02:27:38.760 --> 02:27:45.560]  more fans in mexico than i have in austin texas hotel managers bartenders the lady cleaning the room
[02:27:46.360 --> 02:27:51.960]  you know just everywhere were listeners and it's so crazy how when i was in london i got mob
[02:27:51.960 --> 02:27:59.080]  just live feeds at big bend people just walking by brits were listeners and then um like like you
[02:27:59.080 --> 02:28:04.920]  said all these listeners in in in the middle east but but it's not about me being big it's showing
[02:28:04.920 --> 02:28:10.360]  that internationally humans want freedom just like your show is popular worldwide and that's
[02:28:10.360 --> 02:28:15.560]  got to really shake up the globalists because they're not americans they've hijacked this country
[02:28:15.560 --> 02:28:21.320]  and they're scared that people that are real americans are just real humans like our listeners
[02:28:21.320 --> 02:28:28.280]  are wise to them max yeah they're getting you know the american revolution i think only one
[02:28:28.280 --> 02:28:33.720]  third of the american population was actually for the revolution uh one third was against it
[02:28:33.720 --> 02:28:39.640]  and one third was completely ambivalent you only need a third of the population to create a revolution
[02:28:41.240 --> 02:28:45.240]  that's extremely conservative i was three percent started at five percent wanted
[02:28:45.240 --> 02:28:49.800]  and then about thirty percent aided the other five percent you're absolutely right but five
[02:28:49.800 --> 02:28:55.000]  percent actually you don't need the whole population or even a majority to get a revolution
[02:28:55.000 --> 02:29:00.600]  going you just need a focused minority and you have your revolution and that's why they're scared
[02:29:00.600 --> 02:29:06.520]  of us because we are that cadre that can train the mass cadre and have the big win for a worldwide
[02:29:06.520 --> 02:29:12.760]  renaissance max keiser dot com from the front lines of the renaissance reporting from albion uh thank

[02:29:31.800 --> 02:29:36.680]  which is satanic in nature of course every all knowledge is evil according to the establishment
[02:29:36.680 --> 02:29:41.800]  you need to learn one word racism or two words homophobe and you just say that you pay the rent

[02:29:46.440 --> 02:29:54.760]  we're on the march the empires on the run alex jones and the gcn radio network
[02:29:58.840 --> 02:30:05.400]  let's talk about the real war on women first wave feminism was a noble cause but modern
[02:30:05.400 --> 02:30:11.560]  feminists well instead of fighting for say paid and protected maternity leave they want to ban
[02:30:11.560 --> 02:30:19.400]  words shirts and man spreading come on that's cultural marxism which asserts that culture
[02:30:19.400 --> 02:30:26.200]  and language is responsible for oppressing women and not the state the truth is the state encourages
[02:30:26.200 --> 02:30:31.720]  gender wars it's a divide and conquer tactic designed to keep us fighting amongst ourselves
[02:30:31.720 --> 02:30:37.160]  in fact the feminist movement was hijacked by the political class to exploit women as the late
[02:30:37.160 --> 02:30:42.920]  erin russo revealed the rockefellers bankrolled feminism and not because they had any interest
[02:30:42.920 --> 02:30:48.120]  in women's rights but because women in the workforce was the ultimate trifecta the state
[02:30:48.120 --> 02:30:53.560]  collects more tax dollars children are indoctrinated at an earlier age and the traditional family

[02:33:47.000 --> 02:33:51.320]  fade coming up i've got some really good news that i should have led the broadcast with today
[02:33:51.320 --> 02:33:54.040]  but that's where the third hour is so important we ended up getting to more of the news than
[02:33:55.000 --> 02:34:01.800]  than other hours sometimes this is out of london guardian and it is a amazing
[02:34:01.800 --> 02:34:16.520]  backtrack and it ties in to brave epa and fda scientist in 2001 and again in 2011
[02:34:18.120 --> 02:34:25.160]  that took the time to get thousands of scientists in each body in fact in the fda
[02:34:25.160 --> 02:34:37.160]  they got something like 98% of the scientists and toxicologists to sign letters to the directors
[02:34:37.160 --> 02:34:43.400]  of their agencies calling for the immediate abolition of hydrofluorosalic acid being added
[02:34:43.400 --> 02:34:52.200]  to the water and finally congress acted quietly and said you need to reduce it
[02:34:52.200 --> 02:34:57.160]  from 1.2 parts to 0.7
[02:35:00.360 --> 02:35:02.840]  this is a devastating victory
[02:35:05.800 --> 02:35:08.920]  just like chipotle just announced they're not going to have any gmo
[02:35:09.800 --> 02:35:13.400]  and tyson chicken that right after mcdonald's announced it just announced they're going to stop
[02:35:13.400 --> 02:35:24.840]  feeding antibiotics to chickens another devastating victory from cnn
[02:35:27.240 --> 02:35:30.680]  they are now announcing they're going to cut the fluoride in the water by half
[02:35:31.400 --> 02:35:35.320]  that means that your iqs will only be reduced by about five to six points
[02:35:36.280 --> 02:35:40.680]  and it means you will have a lower level of bone cancer not the seven-fold increase only three
[02:35:40.680 --> 02:35:46.600]  percent or so or three time increase it's very loving and all the other things it's connected to
[02:35:47.880 --> 02:35:53.480]  but the reason it's such a big victory is we can really really go after the city councils now
[02:35:54.040 --> 02:35:58.360]  i mean folks if their fluoride fraud falls it all falls
[02:36:03.240 --> 02:36:07.800]  you know i try to not talk like batman christian bell batman
[02:36:07.800 --> 02:36:12.120]  so i try unlike other talk show hosts to talk with a
[02:36:12.920 --> 02:36:17.720]  high-pitched voice compared to my real voice but i have a worn out voice and never took
[02:36:17.720 --> 02:36:22.680]  speech lessons i never uh plus there's a lot of pollen in austin right now and last night um
[02:36:26.520 --> 02:36:31.640]  my son told me that i shunted like a cross between oscar the grouch and batman
[02:36:31.640 --> 02:36:38.440]  because i was like all right i'm not gonna cook you another snack you've already eaten dinner
[02:36:38.440 --> 02:36:43.560]  just get a glass of milk if you want some fruit it's 10 30 you're up out of bed i want to go to
[02:36:43.560 --> 02:36:49.880]  sleep because last night i really had a horse from the horse voice from the pollen but i shunted
[02:36:49.880 --> 02:36:57.400]  just like it's ridiculous and then i hear myself sometimes when i really start talking like i sound
[02:36:57.400 --> 02:37:03.720]  now i gotta go take speech lessons or something on how to keep my voice because i talk so much
[02:37:03.720 --> 02:37:07.560]  and i don't talk in a way that doesn't blow out my larynx from all my yelling and screaming over
[02:37:07.560 --> 02:37:14.680]  the years and so my voice is becoming more toed-like by the minute pretty soon was like ribbit ribbit
[02:37:15.720 --> 02:37:22.600]  but uh that is another career though in this i i can go off and do voiceovers i guess
[02:37:22.600 --> 02:37:26.360]  yes i have done voiceovers
[02:37:28.360 --> 02:37:34.360]  what a what a wondrous world we live in there's just so many opportunities uh here's the headline
[02:37:34.360 --> 02:37:38.680]  i'm gonna cover it more in a moment after i finish up with the baltimore news and take calls u.s
[02:37:38.680 --> 02:37:44.520]  lowers fluoride levels in drinking water for first time in over 50 years london guardian
[02:37:46.040 --> 02:37:51.240]  oh another one of our conspiracy theories comes true you know what else they did four years ago
[02:37:51.240 --> 02:37:57.800]  to be phasing over four years now we're here they said yes stop using fluoride-based pesticides on
[02:37:57.800 --> 02:38:06.360]  plants because it bio accumulates to to to wait for it not hundreds of parts per million
[02:38:10.280 --> 02:38:11.160]  but even higher
[02:38:11.160 --> 02:38:18.600]  there they they spray it on the grapes and other
[02:38:19.640 --> 02:38:26.360]  mainly fruits but some some vegetables and the buggies die because it's so good for them that's
[02:38:26.360 --> 02:38:35.160]  why there's colon crossbones on the containers the original famous rat poisons were fluoride you
[02:38:35.160 --> 02:38:39.000]  would sprinkle out where the rats were walking or mice and then they would lick their feet
[02:38:39.000 --> 02:38:48.040]  and you know what would happen buy buy cupcake because it's so good for you that's why the
[02:38:48.040 --> 02:38:56.280]  government puts it in the water my dad's a dentist and he was a smart guy but he went off the propaganda
[02:38:56.280 --> 02:39:01.640]  of the big push of the american dental association and a big canadian dental association head that
[02:39:01.640 --> 02:39:05.160]  got it florided there in the 80s that guy went public a few years ago and said he was all wrong
[02:39:05.160 --> 02:39:09.560]  he says i thought it was calcium fluoride which you do need a small amount of
[02:39:10.360 --> 02:39:14.760]  he goes i didn't know it was hydrofluorosalic acid and i didn't know it was shipped in from
[02:39:14.760 --> 02:39:19.640]  china and other areas and it was full of hundreds of other chemicals and was given a waiver yes
[02:39:20.280 --> 02:39:25.000]  we've played newscast here from like abc news out of oklahoma and places where they actually
[02:39:25.000 --> 02:39:30.200]  went and investigated it and they tested one bag from china that was being put i think it was
[02:39:30.200 --> 02:39:38.360]  tulsa water gotta pull that up and it had 250 something chemicals in it led mercury arsenic
[02:39:41.320 --> 02:39:47.560]  so stupid that that we can't even get it out of our water but but but here's the deal as big a
[02:39:47.560 --> 02:39:57.400]  hoax as this stuff is once one level of it begins to fall it all falls see a giant fraud's hard to
[02:39:57.400 --> 02:40:02.840]  beat until you start to get holes in it then it collapses fast that's why they gotta get everything
[02:40:02.840 --> 02:40:08.120]  over on us and people thought she was nuts back in the 90s when jocelyn elders came out and said
[02:40:08.120 --> 02:40:13.400]  you know help children reach down and masturbate when they're five years old at school have masturbation
[02:40:13.400 --> 02:40:18.120]  time set a nap time at their lunch for 30 minutes you know the and then she took them we need to have
[02:40:18.120 --> 02:40:24.600]  look teachers reach down and help them you know as a creepy lady in an admiral outfit that's weirder
[02:40:24.600 --> 02:40:29.880]  than hell ron hubbard you know telling them how to play with their tallywhackers i mean i'm sorry
[02:40:29.880 --> 02:40:37.880]  to talk like that but this is what's going on with these fruits that run things and now today
[02:40:40.440 --> 02:40:44.840]  it's mainstream and they're just in there doing whatever they want see they got us they just they
[02:40:44.840 --> 02:40:50.280]  just pushed it and did it just like florid all the scientists came out in the 40s and said my god
[02:40:50.280 --> 02:40:55.720]  don't put that no water is deadly poison anyway those are crazy people i think the russians are
[02:40:55.720 --> 02:41:00.520]  in planning microchips or radio transmitters in their teeth didn't have microchips yet
[02:41:01.560 --> 02:41:06.680]  and then they would have national shows just propaganda and sitcoms and dramas and game shows
[02:41:06.680 --> 02:41:13.960]  where they'd go mrs johnson you don't think there's a chip in your teeth to you because
[02:41:13.960 --> 02:41:18.280]  they'd ask it which of the contestants believes floride might be bad for you it's part of a
[02:41:18.280 --> 02:41:23.160]  soviet conspiracy of course it wasn't a soviet conspiracy it was a globalist conspiracy and
[02:41:23.160 --> 02:41:27.800]  they'd be like well i've done some research and believe it okay and you think there's i've seen
[02:41:27.800 --> 02:41:33.960]  a club of this you think there's a radio transmitter too in there and they have laugh signs come on in
[02:41:33.960 --> 02:41:43.800]  the crowd goes ah i've actually had anti gunners before follow me after a um gun rally we were at
[02:41:43.800 --> 02:41:47.960]  and they followed me into a restaurant and waited while i was eating then walked over and went

[02:42:27.160 --> 02:42:36.680]  next news we talk a lot about subliminals and a subliminal is just flashing up there a word like
[02:42:36.680 --> 02:42:43.080]  dumb or fool when they show someone they don't like they'll just flash up for a millisecond
[02:42:43.080 --> 02:42:48.040]  something your conscious mind can't pick up but your unconscious does and they've got other stuff as
[02:42:48.040 --> 02:42:57.400]  well but a big one is subliminal audio they have that back in the 30s on radio and they found little
[02:42:57.400 --> 02:43:04.120]  things like you know having a ad for car commercials back in the 70s and then they would run a loop
[02:43:04.120 --> 02:43:11.160]  track of a woman going oh you see you're you're listening right now too aren't you the point
[02:43:11.160 --> 02:43:17.320]  is is that they would run that just subliminal where you barely can hear it but your subconscious
[02:43:18.280 --> 02:43:23.560]  could pick up the lowest again it was audibly being picked up but your subconscious picked it up
[02:43:23.560 --> 02:43:27.320]  kind of like a lot of people can hear dog whistles it makes them uncomfortable but they can't
[02:43:27.320 --> 02:43:34.280]  physically consciously hear it but the unconscious brain is connected to areas of the nerves
[02:43:34.280 --> 02:43:41.960]  that are able to sense it so they know this but but this is near subliminal because you can hear it
[02:43:41.960 --> 02:43:46.120]  when you're conscious if you're awake but if you're in a suspended disbelief sitting there
[02:43:46.120 --> 02:43:51.640]  drooling watching your favorite cop show and then the AARP show comes on and it's a woman sitting
[02:43:51.640 --> 02:43:57.240]  there knitting and they're talking about martial law well we've boosted the audio and Paul Joseph
[02:43:57.240 --> 02:44:03.720]  Watson has done a report on this the videos on info wars dot com PSA contains bizarre subliminal
[02:44:03.720 --> 02:44:11.320]  message about martial law commercial for lobby group conditioning americans for civil unrest
[02:44:11.320 --> 02:44:17.640]  AARP's also anti-gun folks but people who are now you know 56 go well it's time for me to go I got
[02:44:17.640 --> 02:44:23.160]  my free magazine I'm part of it now it's a free magazine I'm gonna send them money now another
[02:44:23.160 --> 02:44:28.760]  crap and you're just giving money to a group of anti-american piranhas that claim they're there
[02:44:28.760 --> 02:44:35.640]  to protect you let's go to the subliminal messaging which we've boosted the audio to non-subliminal
[02:44:35.640 --> 02:44:42.840]  levels stay with us a bizarre commercial for insurance company AARP described as one of the
[02:44:42.840 --> 02:44:50.280]  most powerful lobbying organizations in the united states contains a bizarre subliminal message
[02:44:50.280 --> 02:44:58.280]  about martial law being declared in america so first I'll play the commercial at normal audio levels
[02:44:58.280 --> 02:45:03.960]  you'll notice a television news presenter in the background but you won't be able to quite
[02:45:03.960 --> 02:45:08.760]  make out what he's saying so here's the commercial at normal audio levels
[02:45:11.240 --> 02:45:14.920]  woman gets off the chair she's walking
[02:45:18.040 --> 02:45:21.480]  doesn't see her daughter it's all about insecurity
[02:45:21.480 --> 02:45:29.000]  and here's the commercial with the audio levels boosted and a transcript of what is being said
[02:45:29.000 --> 02:45:34.520]  by this tv news announcer turn your speaker volume up folks
[02:45:34.520 --> 02:45:54.520]  so the obvious question is why is this subliminal message about martial law being declared by
[02:45:54.520 --> 02:46:01.640]  the president after an outbreak appearing in a public service announcement for caregiving
[02:46:01.640 --> 02:46:09.560]  put out by an insurance barma has said it was a test whatsoever within the context of the ad
[02:46:10.120 --> 02:46:18.520]  and think about this this had to be specifically created by the company to appear in this psa
[02:46:18.520 --> 02:46:26.200]  they couldn't use an actual segment from a tv news broadcast a because they would be concerned
[02:46:26.200 --> 02:46:33.880]  about copyright and b because no such news broadcast exists about the president declaring
[02:46:33.880 --> 02:46:40.360]  martial law in america after an outbreak so they've deliberately put this in and it's not
[02:46:40.360 --> 02:46:47.560]  going to be heard consciously but it may be picked up subliminally by the viewer i mean what the
[02:46:47.560 --> 02:46:54.040]  hell is going on here this is bizarre and then of course we have the involvement of the ad council
[02:46:54.040 --> 02:47:00.840]  the ad council basically operates as a public relations arm of the u.s. government and according
[02:47:00.840 --> 02:47:06.520]  to history professor robert griffith the ad council is now so closely tied at the hip
[02:47:06.520 --> 02:47:12.440]  with the white house that it now basically operates as quote little more than a domestic
[02:47:12.440 --> 02:47:17.400]  propaganda arm of the federal government the ad council is now so closely tied at the hip
[02:47:17.400 --> 02:47:24.840]  basically operates as quote little more than a domestic propaganda arm of the federal government
[02:47:24.840 --> 02:47:30.840]  so we have psa's being put out by one of the most influential lobbying groups in america
[02:47:30.840 --> 02:47:38.680]  it's supported by the ad council which is now operating as a propaganda arm of the u.s. government
[02:47:38.680 --> 02:47:46.120]  talking about the president declaring martial law in america and this is subliminally embedded
[02:47:46.120 --> 02:47:54.280]  into a commercial about caregiving so is it really any wonder that people are so concerned
[02:47:54.280 --> 02:48:01.880]  about martial law when this is happening amidst numerous national guard police and military
[02:48:01.880 --> 02:48:08.760]  drills across the country there needs to be a foreign request and a lawsuit over this and you
[02:48:08.760 --> 02:48:13.320]  will find that just like media matters meets weekly the ad council on record meets weekly
[02:48:13.320 --> 02:48:20.040]  the this is probably in hundreds of tv shows and ads any government affiliated group it's already
[02:48:20.040 --> 02:48:24.920]  overtly we can air newscasts going martial law is coming you will take force inoculations your
[02:48:24.920 --> 02:48:29.320]  preachers are government agents and we will take your guns i mean i can play that newscast if you
[02:48:29.320 --> 02:48:38.760]  want then we're like that's a bad idea shut up crazy there's no plan this is what they do it's
[02:48:38.760 --> 02:48:44.360]  a sigh up they're doing it showing the woman putting a towel on her five-year-old daughter
[02:48:45.880 --> 02:48:51.000]  the tender love and care so that you're subliminally scared and associate martial law
[02:48:51.000 --> 02:48:57.880]  and the president declaring martial law with protecting your child it sells the idea just
[02:48:57.880 --> 02:49:03.320]  like they'll cut every time a score is made in basketball or football to troops in the audience
[02:49:03.320 --> 02:49:10.360]  associating pavlovingly that you get a touchdown in a euphoric rush when you are involved with the
[02:49:10.360 --> 02:49:17.240]  military i mean that folks you're under total attack and we're the opposite of subliminal here
[02:49:18.760 --> 02:49:22.840]  we're hitting people hardcore across the head with the truth
[02:49:25.640 --> 02:49:30.840]  we wear it openly nakedly we we're here about getting you conscious because here's the deal
[02:49:30.840 --> 02:49:38.040]  so you dial up your senses and become aware of the manipulation then you'll start picking it up
[02:49:38.040 --> 02:49:42.920]  everywhere and it's and by the way even if you're a bad person i don't care you make more money in
[02:49:42.920 --> 02:49:48.920]  business you'll be more aware just turn on folks i mean this show is about turning on turning on
[02:49:48.920 --> 02:49:57.080]  your intellect getting to the real world let's go ahead and uh said idiot spinny stone line i guess
[02:49:57.080 --> 02:50:01.160]  he hung up i want to go break come back to other people well let's finish up with some of uh watson's

[02:50:30.280 --> 02:50:37.880]  populations and even those who dismiss conspiracy theories about martial law and civil unrest
[02:50:37.880 --> 02:50:45.480]  you've got to admit that this is really bizarre this martial law subliminal has no place within
[02:50:45.480 --> 02:50:49.640]  the context of this advert garen need to be everywhere had to have been put in there deliberately
[02:50:49.640 --> 02:50:54.360]  notice our people found it though why why has this been put in this psa commercial we're going to

[03:00:37.160 --> 03:00:45.400]  like mcbreen found a video where sharpie ad shows a protest and the signs say don't protest we only
[03:00:45.400 --> 03:00:50.920]  see it for like half a second but your subconscious picks it up i mean we're getting hit hard folks
[03:00:51.640 --> 03:00:56.200]  they're preparing for a marshal law takeover for a long time i don't know if it's today or next
[03:00:56.200 --> 03:01:03.080]  week or five years from now but man it's exponentially gearing up until we're pretty much
[03:01:03.080 --> 03:01:07.720]  just there regardless and then people ask when did it come and nobody knows an exact date we're
[03:01:07.720 --> 03:01:15.480]  just living in a tyranny most people be happy to have a video in one day with 106 000 views i'm not
[03:01:17.160 --> 03:01:22.280]  obama deception shouldn't just have 40 million views it should have 50 100 million i mean we
[03:01:22.280 --> 03:01:28.840]  need to hit the enemy hard here i'm not risking my life to lose i want to go 100 up against these
[03:01:28.840 --> 03:01:36.520]  scumballs let's go ahead and talk to gerry and georgia go ahead hey alex um i'm on the facebook
[03:01:36.520 --> 03:01:41.800]  page of the baltimore mayor stephanie rollings lake and there are thousands of calls for her
[03:01:41.800 --> 03:01:46.680]  resignation yeah she's a she's a horrible demon who who helped the rioters and now we know she
[03:01:46.680 --> 03:01:52.440]  works for obama it's come out kit daniels wrote about it what do you think of her well i i hotlinked
[03:01:52.440 --> 03:01:59.800]  your your article uh that just came out about her working with obama uh to federal police but if you
[03:01:59.800 --> 03:02:07.160]  go to her posting on april 22nd she said that she firmly supported body cameras for police but if
[03:02:07.160 --> 03:02:14.760]  you google baltimore mayor beatle's body cameras for police she beatled a bill for body i know
[03:02:14.760 --> 03:02:18.680]  everything these days alive and if they had a body camera that you only turn on during the
[03:02:18.680 --> 03:02:22.360]  encounters i think they should always be on because that's big brother then we didn't we'd know right
[03:02:22.360 --> 03:02:26.680]  away what happened we can either charge the cop or give him a medal depending on what the truth was
[03:02:27.320 --> 03:02:34.440]  for for killing this guy uh instead we never know and she beatled it but she's saying she's for it
[03:02:35.160 --> 03:02:40.520]  she's a she's a complete liar but she's being called to resign by thousands right now and i just
[03:02:40.520 --> 03:02:45.160]  want to encourage people to go on there comment or just if they don't want to comment at least hotlink
[03:02:45.160 --> 03:02:50.760]  one of your articles about her and just absolutely folks go to the enemies facebook's and twitter's

[03:03:21.160 --> 03:03:30.280]  caller sorry the others hi alex hey i'm tying into mexico iser earlier i'm wondering uh also you
[03:03:30.280 --> 03:03:35.640]  mentioned obama deception what about obama deception too and calling these people out showing them
[03:03:35.640 --> 03:03:41.720]  where they are and uh maybe getting them to go running hiding their caves and pray that they
[03:03:41.720 --> 03:03:47.320]  don't see the face of the one that would kill them well here's what i know i can do syndicated
[03:03:47.320 --> 03:03:52.920]  radio interviews with other people and i can make many documentaries that end up getting
[03:03:52.920 --> 03:03:58.440]  seen by more people than say a two hour film yes if i make it give it up for free on the
[03:03:58.440 --> 03:04:03.320]  internet but also sell blue rays and stuff we can make money which then funds the operation
[03:04:04.280 --> 03:04:09.880]  but if i can sell other products and find the operation and then put out more media and reach
[03:04:09.880 --> 03:04:16.520]  more people i do a cost-benefit analysis um i really should though finish things i started
[03:04:16.520 --> 03:04:20.840]  i've been working on obama deception too for five years there's been three different films made and
[03:04:21.960 --> 03:04:25.880]  dozens more than dozens probably 30 40 powerful interviews that haven't been seen
[03:04:25.880 --> 03:04:31.880]  we should at least start putting those on the internet um it's a great question i i just you
[03:04:31.880 --> 03:04:36.440]  know i just can't work till 10 at night anymore i do it sometimes i do coast to coast sometimes
[03:04:36.440 --> 03:04:43.480]  uh all working no play makes jack a dull boy i'm 41 years old and um i work 10 hours a day and
[03:04:43.480 --> 03:04:51.080]  then that's it take a fork in me i'm done i i just um i just it's too depressing to look at the
[03:04:51.080 --> 03:05:07.480]  scum i i just that's why i can't stand it it's it's it's the globalists they're just no that's
