[00:00.000 --> 00:14.720]  The answer to 1984 is 1776 you're listening to the Alex Jones show
[00:14.720 --> 00:32.200]  we're live February 25th 2019 and we've got an amazing raft of guests in studio
[00:32.200 --> 00:39.600]  and not in studio and incredible breaking news we're gonna go over all of it on the
[00:39.600 --> 00:44.640]  other side you won't believe what AOC said next but first I want to go to the
[00:44.640 --> 00:51.120]  important report Californians can't name the 45th president this shows the
[00:51.120 --> 00:56.400]  incredible ignorance of blue areas here it is
[00:56.400 --> 01:05.540]  president is now the Bush Donald Trump oh yeah how many presidents we've had
[01:05.540 --> 01:22.600]  45 all right so do you know the current president is Obama you're watching
[01:22.600 --> 01:26.260]  info wars.com and Venice Beach in California we're asking people one
[01:26.260 --> 01:36.720]  simple question who is the 45th president of the United States. Hey guys can you
[01:36.720 --> 01:52.120]  tell me who the 45th president of the United States is Barack Obama. Who's the 45th president of the United States. I have no idea. Can you name the 45th president Obama?
[01:52.120 --> 02:02.980]  Do you know who the 45th president of the United States is? Barack Obama. Do you know? Can you tell me who the 45th
[02:02.980 --> 02:06.460]  president of the United States is? Washington. Do you guys know who the
[02:06.460 --> 02:11.860]  45th president of the United States is? There isn't a 45th. Do you know who the 45th
[02:11.860 --> 02:41.260]  president is? Negative go strider I do not. You don't any guesses? No. It's Donald Trump but okay. Anyone in tag team help him out here? Let's phone a friend.

Here we are. We've had 45. Alright. So Obama. It's not George Washington, George Bush. No emotion. No life force. Who?
[03:08.160 --> 03:35.160]  Donald Trump. Nope, no fire in the eyes. Do you know the 45th president of the United States is? No I did not. You don't? No. What did you say? It was the president. It was the president. Do you know who the 50th president of the United States is? There isn't one.
[03:35.160 --> 03:36.160]  Donald Trump?
[03:36.160 --> 03:37.160]  Donald Trump?
[03:37.160 --> 03:38.160]  Is that his name?
[03:38.160 --> 03:40.160]  You don't know who the 45th president is?
[03:40.160 --> 03:41.160]  No.
[03:41.160 --> 03:42.160]  Is it Bush?
[03:42.160 --> 03:43.160]  It's Donald Trump.
[03:43.160 --> 03:44.160]  Oh, yeah.
[03:44.160 --> 03:45.160]  F*** that guy.
[03:45.160 --> 03:46.160]  You don't like him?
[03:46.160 --> 03:47.160]  No, I'm a socialist.
[03:47.160 --> 03:48.160]  Oh, you're a socialist.
[03:48.160 --> 03:49.160]  Cool.
[03:49.160 --> 03:50.160]  All right.
[03:50.160 --> 03:51.160]  Well, enjoy your capitalism here.
[03:51.160 --> 03:52.160]  Yeah.
[03:52.160 --> 03:53.160]  Yeah.
[03:53.160 --> 03:54.160]  Those stars in Venezuela, fat ass.
[03:54.160 --> 03:56.160]  Can you tell me who the 45th president of the United States is?
[03:56.160 --> 03:57.160]  Nope.
[03:57.160 --> 03:58.160]  Not just one guess.
[03:58.160 --> 03:59.160]  One guess.
[03:59.160 --> 04:00.160]  President Trump.
[04:00.160 --> 04:01.160]  It is.
[04:01.160 --> 04:04.160]  Do you know who the 45th president of the United States is?
[04:04.160 --> 04:05.160]  Trump.
[04:05.160 --> 04:06.160]  Trump.
[04:06.160 --> 04:07.160]  There you go.
[04:07.160 --> 04:08.160]  Who?
[04:08.160 --> 04:09.160]  Barack Obama.
[04:09.160 --> 04:10.160]  It's Trump.
[04:10.160 --> 04:11.160]  Trump.
[04:11.160 --> 04:14.160]  So if the 44th president was Obama, who's the 45th?
[04:14.160 --> 04:15.160]  Donald Trump.
[04:15.160 --> 04:16.160]  Good job.
[04:16.160 --> 04:20.160]  Can you tell me who the 45th president of the United States is?
[04:20.160 --> 04:21.160]  No.
[04:21.160 --> 04:22.160]  Trump.
[04:22.160 --> 04:24.160]  Ding, ding, ding.
[04:24.160 --> 04:27.160]  Who's the 45th president of the United States?
[04:27.160 --> 04:28.160]  The current one.
[04:28.160 --> 04:29.160]  Donald Trump.
[04:29.160 --> 04:30.160]  Donald Trump.
[04:30.160 --> 04:31.160]  Donald Trump.
[04:31.160 --> 04:32.160]  Donald Trump.
[04:32.160 --> 04:34.160]  He's the current president of the United States.
[04:34.160 --> 04:35.160]  The current one.
[04:35.160 --> 04:36.160]  You got it right.
[04:36.160 --> 04:39.160]  What do you think about people who don't know the answer to that question?
[04:39.160 --> 04:43.160]  We got a problem with the education system in this country, don't we?
[04:43.160 --> 04:46.160]  Can you tell me who the 45th president of the United States is?
[04:46.160 --> 04:48.160]  I don't care for presidents.
[04:48.160 --> 04:50.160]  Did you say George Washington?
[04:50.160 --> 04:51.160]  No.
[04:51.160 --> 04:53.160]  No, it's Trump.
[04:53.160 --> 04:54.160]  I'm Alex.
[04:54.160 --> 04:55.160]  I'm Kate.
[04:55.160 --> 04:56.160]  And I'm Alex.
[04:56.160 --> 04:58.160]  watching InfoWars.com
[05:26.160 --> 05:37.160]  We have developed, hands down from our research, the most powerful, healthy energy drink pre-workout and beyond system in the world.
[05:37.160 --> 05:47.160]  There's nothing else like it, you must experience it. It is a total game changer and it comes in easy to use, packets to mix in with fruit juice or water, whatever you'd like.
[05:47.160 --> 05:57.160]  Warning though, it's very very strong, it lasts up to 10 hours, so take a half packet the first time you take it because TurboForce is named TurboForce because it will take you into overdrive.
[05:57.160 --> 06:17.160]  TurboForce at InfoWarsLive.com
[06:27.160 --> 06:56.160]  If we don't turn the ship around and so it's basically like there's scientific consensus that the lives of children are going to be very difficult and it does lead, I think, young people to have a legitimate question.
[06:56.160 --> 07:19.160]  You know, should, is it okay to still have children? And I mean, not just financially because people are graduating with $20, $30, $100,000 worth of student loan debt and so they can't even afford to have kids in the house but also just this basic moral question like what do we do?
[07:19.160 --> 07:29.160]  And even if you don't have kids, there are still children here in the world and we have a moral obligation to them to leave a better world for them.
[07:29.160 --> 07:38.160]  And this idea that if we just, you know, I've been working on this for X amount of years, it's like not good enough.
[07:38.160 --> 07:49.160]  We need a universal sense of urgency and people are trying to like introduce watered down proposals that are frankly going to kill us.
[07:49.160 --> 07:59.160]  A lack of urgency is going to kill us. It doesn't matter if you agree that climate change is an important issue. At this point, it doesn't matter.
[07:59.160 --> 08:06.160]  If you believe climate change is a problem, that's not even the issue.
[08:06.160 --> 08:16.160]  So there she is on Instagram Live. Of course, the evil Alex Jones isn't allowed on Instagram Live or Periscope or YouTube or any of those places.
[08:16.160 --> 08:30.160]  Because you can't have me go, oh look, I made a film called Endgame, blueprint for global enslavement 11 years ago with their own documents admitting they want a planetary government that you'll have a World ID card tied to a planetary social score,
[08:30.160 --> 08:39.160]  a algorithm profiles, what I called it, and it'll track everything you do in live time with your carbon credits and tax and control you.
[08:39.160 --> 08:54.160]  Forced inoculations, sex education of five year olds teaching them to be homosexual. All of it's here, the state coming in to reduce population by design.
[08:54.160 --> 09:12.160]  And now it's all mainstream news and AOC can sit up there unopposed in these cheesy look, I'm a regular person, I'm chopping up sweet potatoes here in my kitchen.
[09:12.160 --> 09:24.160]  Probably said a big rail of methamphetamine right before it. So is it okay to have kids in the face of climate change? This is their religion.
[09:24.160 --> 09:30.160]  And you notice she said there's a consensus of scientists. Turn out that's all been proven to be a fraud.
[09:30.160 --> 09:42.160]  First it was the world's going to freeze in the 60s and 70s and 80s. The new ice age caused by carbon dioxide. Then it was going to be warming because we did warm for a while.
[09:42.160 --> 09:51.160]  And then we started cooling off again. Well now it's just change. A legitimate question. Is it okay to still have children?
[09:51.160 --> 10:03.160]  Well let me see, the Japanese have 1.1 child for every two adults. The Italians have 1.2 children. The United States has 1.6.
[10:03.160 --> 10:19.160]  The third world on average has about four. And so don't worry, Europe is dying. Japan's dying. And most indigenous groups around the world are also dying.
[10:19.160 --> 10:28.160]  But what's not dying is third world populations out of Latin America and Africa and then of course the slave population of China and India.
[10:28.160 --> 10:42.160]  Those populations are exploding. And they're going under total authoritarianism. It's mind blowing that we've gotten to this point.
[10:42.160 --> 10:53.160]  But there's AOC. She wears $3,000, $5,000 outfit. She wears $1,000 shoes.
[10:53.160 --> 11:04.160]  But that's okay if she earned it. The problem is she's in bad mouths. People that have a carbon footprint or have children.
[11:04.160 --> 11:14.160]  When it's people like her that fly around on private jets that have carbon footprints hundreds of times bigger than regular persons. By the way, a carbon footprint's wonderful.
[11:14.160 --> 11:25.160]  They believe Mars once had water. They know it has ice caps, but flowing water. But somehow lost its atmosphere.
[11:25.160 --> 11:41.160]  Well, we're losing our atmosphere. That's fact. The atmosphere was much thicker in all the ice core and all the mud studies and other deep core studies they've done where carbon dioxide was hundreds of times higher than it is now.
[11:41.160 --> 12:00.160]  To trace gas now. Plants and animals will live off two gases, oxygen and carbon dioxide in a symbiotic relationship. And carbon dioxide levels are way lower than they were a million years ago.
[12:00.160 --> 12:12.160]  And now a little bit of human activity puts a little bit more atmosphere out there. And governments respond with a global secret covert operation.
[12:12.160 --> 12:30.160]  Much of what has now been declassified to spray barium salts, aluminum dioxide and radioactive isotopes into the air, which are actually stripping the atmosphere and fitting the ozone layer.
[12:30.160 --> 12:43.160]  So this is the standard talking point of the world population group and all the rest of the tissue genics groups. And you can argue, okay, maybe some places are overpopulated.
[12:43.160 --> 13:01.160]  But the issue is, is the globalist then target the highest IQ areas, the highest IQ demographics and tell them not to have children. It's like the movie Idiocracy. This genius that my good friend Mike Judge wrote.
[13:01.160 --> 13:18.160]  Literally just a couple of days, he wrote that. And it was a 200 years in the future, people are so stupid from inbreeding of dumb people that the average person can hardly talk. He said, you know, who knew it would actually come in 20 years?
[13:18.160 --> 13:32.160]  Oh, that's another interview you can't see. I forgot YouTube had millions of views took it down. You can't hear my judge, the interviewed. You don't hear AOC, right?
[13:32.160 --> 13:48.160]  And that's what's happening is the dumbest, laziest people, they can be white, they can be black, but the lowest IQ people are having the most children and the government, the system pushes that and promotes it. But in Idiocracy, it shows the two really smart people, the couple,
[13:48.160 --> 14:01.160]  who both have 160 IQs, but they're a little nervous, want to save some more money first and not sure it's good for the earth. So they don't have any kids, but the dumb people have kids. And so the population gets stupider and stupider.
[14:01.160 --> 14:12.160]  Of course, remember, she also just said a month ago, or I guess three weeks ago, that all human life will be dead in 12 years from climate change.
[14:12.160 --> 14:21.160]  Now, obviously, she thinks in 12 years, well, it doesn't happen. You won't remember. Here she is.
[14:21.160 --> 14:41.160]  And I think that the part of it that is generational is that millennials and people and, you know, Gen Z and all these folks that come after us are looking up and we're like, the world is going to end in 12 years if we don't address climate change
[14:41.160 --> 14:58.160]  and your biggest issue is how are we going to pay for it? And like, this is the war. This is our World War Two.
[14:58.160 --> 15:14.160]  I'm speechless. The unintentional comedy here is stunning. Until you watch the video with Caitlin Bennett, m4wars.com reporter out in California. She wasn't cherry picking. She talks to 50 people.
[15:14.160 --> 15:23.160]  Everybody she talked to is in the tape. And two of them out of 50 know that the 45th president is Trump. Two people.
[15:23.160 --> 15:31.160]  These folks, white, black, old, young, Hispanic, they don't know what planet they're on.
[15:31.160 --> 15:42.160]  They can't find their asses with both hands. But you know what? They hear AOC. The world's going to end if you don't let me run everything.
[15:42.160 --> 15:56.160]  It's like Joy Bayard. We caught Trump. He's a Russian agent. Yeah. Even if that's true, you don't go, yeah, that's horrible, but it's not true. These are just scum. They are absolute mindless idiots led by demons.
[15:56.160 --> 16:16.160]  We'll be right back. Stay well.
[16:27.160 --> 16:35.160]  We pledge allegiance to one flag and that flag is the American flag.

[20:46.160 --> 21:00.160]  President Trump is preparing to depart to Vietnam to meet with Kim Jong-un. Chuck Todd and others are saying it's all just PR to make the president look good.
[21:00.160 --> 21:18.160]  Getting Kim Jong-un for over a year to not test any more missiles and destroy major nuclear sites even though he hasn't destroyed them all is a big step in the right direction and cutting North Korea out from China who hasn't let them develop and getting them to go the way of South Korea would be good for everybody.
[21:18.160 --> 21:37.160]  Obviously I don't like Kim Jong-un, I don't like communist, but if Trump can get him to stop being part of the Chai Kong oppression of the North Korean people that would be a great victory and is bold and I think has less than 50-50 chance of succeeding.
[21:37.160 --> 21:55.160]  But those that are criticizing it, like Chuck Todd connected to the Clintons and the Obamas when the Clintons helped give the reactors and real systems of oppression to the North and actually aided the North in its oppression in many ways, it's just truly disgusting.
[21:55.160 --> 22:02.160]  Something else that's disgusting I'm going to put up on screen for you is Marco Rubio. I don't like Marco Rubio.
[22:02.160 --> 22:15.160]  You know, I was there, they were having press conferences, he walked over to the press conference I was already at, wouldn't answer my questions, was very rude, the media edited it to make it look like I got in his face.
[22:15.160 --> 22:39.160]  He started threatening to physically attack me. Well, Marco Rubio, Little Marco, Bathhouse Marco, nothing wrong with him being gay, it's just that, you know, Bathhouse Marco is compromised. Little Marco tweeted Rubio threatening Gaddafi-style ending for Venezuela's Maduro.
[22:39.160 --> 22:53.160]  He tweeted that at Maduro. Do you know what that is? That's us getting down to Maduro's level. I know there's bipartisan support to remove the dictator of Venezuela. I hate his guts.
[22:53.160 --> 23:05.160]  They blow up food convoys, they shoot people in the streets, they purposely starve their population for political control. I don't want war with Russia, but Russia and China are both moving weapons into there.
[23:05.160 --> 23:16.160]  We're trying to move food convoys in. Trump is moving to remove Maduro. Pence is in Columbia meeting with the individual that most people believe really won the last election.
[23:16.160 --> 23:26.160]  So the US is getting ready for regime change and it's extremely dangerous and I normally don't like it. Why go overthrow Saddam and put something in worse?
[23:26.160 --> 23:35.160]  Things like that. But with Venezuela, it's destabilizing the entire South America, Brazil, Columbia, everyone's begging the US to do something.
[23:35.160 --> 23:44.160]  Brazil's put troops on their borders. Five million people have already left the last year marching north. It's a national security crisis.
[23:44.160 --> 24:01.160]  And you know, if America was better, like some of the regime change we did in the 50s and things, where we didn't put pure evil in or didn't remove one evil and put something in just as bad, by the 60s our government supported dictators and fascist and murderers.
[24:01.160 --> 24:10.160]  We weren't doing that before, to a great extent. So I don't trust the neocons that are running this and the Democrats to have regime change because they'll put something worse in.
[24:10.160 --> 24:25.160]  I don't trust them to have real elections there because people like Marco Rubio and the neocons are just as bad as Maduro.
[24:25.160 --> 24:38.160]  I mean, you don't tweet something like that. Lamar Gaddafi, eight years before he was killed, made a deal with the US and with Obama and invested 50 plus billion dollars in the US and Europe.
[24:38.160 --> 24:47.160]  And he was giving almost all the money to the people and he was helping Africa. I've studied the situation and he really thought we were his friend after decades of him fighting with the West.
[24:47.160 --> 24:55.160]  He didn't blow up the Lockerbie Scotland plane, all that stuff. That's been confirmed to be BS. Mueller was involved covering that up.
[24:55.160 --> 25:06.160]  And so they cold-bloodedly set him up and sent Al Qaeda in to murder him and he stabilized the whole country and killed hundreds of thousands of people.
[25:06.160 --> 25:18.160]  So that's not good to have somebody that's already opened to the West, wants to build up Africa, wants to work with us and we set him up in killing and Hillary says, I came, I saw, he died.
[25:18.160 --> 25:23.160]  And then she, like a witch.
[25:23.160 --> 25:29.160]  So I get why Trump's leaning towards regime change because it's a failed regime, a thousand star of a week.
[25:29.160 --> 25:36.160]  The government makes it illegal to even talk about it. They're mowing down crowds. They're blowing up food trucks. Maduro is a joke.
[25:36.160 --> 25:44.160]  But I'll tell you this, more Russian troops are going in there. Chinese are going in there. If Trump's going to move, he's got to do it right now.
[25:44.160 --> 25:58.160]  And Marco Rubio sure shouldn't be out there sending images of Gaddafi dead and comparing it to Maduro.
[25:58.160 --> 26:08.160]  It makes me sick, makes me totally sick. I'm going to give this Chuck Todd clip in a minute, but it's two different issues.
[26:08.160 --> 26:16.160]  And I am leaning towards supporting regime change because there is no regime. It's collapsed. It's a hellhole. It's nightmarish. I want Venezuela to be free.
[26:16.160 --> 26:25.160]  It has incredible wealth and a lot of good people. But I have no faith in the globalist. If they get control, they'll make it just as bad or worse.
[26:25.160 --> 26:34.160]  So it's just a real shame you've got bloodthirsty things like this being sent out by Marco Rubio that lowers us to Maduro's level.
[26:34.160 --> 26:45.160]  And then we'll only make Maduro fight harder, send in crap like that to Maduro and his regime only will embolden them and makes us lose the moral high ground.
[26:45.160 --> 26:53.160]  You know, on Friday when we saw those food convoys get burned up, I thought maybe that's a false flag because Maduro really is an idiot.
[26:53.160 --> 27:05.160]  If he thinks he can just burn up a couple hundred trucks or whatever of aid coming in out of Columbia, then he came out and said, we blew them up, we burned them, we're not beggars, and blah, blah, blah.
[27:05.160 --> 27:18.160]  So we had the moral high ground. The Russians are sending troops, the Iranians are sending ships, the Chinese are sending weapons, we're sending food, and then Marco Rubio sends out that damn tweet.
[27:18.160 --> 27:25.160]  He's a punk, a little fake wimp, just following himself, thinks he's so damn cool.
[27:25.160 --> 27:35.160]  He's the problem. The Trotskyites were the people kicked out by Stalin. Marco Rubio is the Trotskyite darling, the Feringi ambassador.
[27:35.160 --> 27:39.160]  Gosh, I wish I would have said, oh, it's the Feringi ambassador.
[27:39.160 --> 27:53.160]  When he said, I don't know who you are. Who are you? Like, I go, oh, you don't know who I am. You're saying I don't exist. I'm being platformed. You've sent me the Phantom Zone. Oh my God, Marco, I'm a frat boy like you that goes to gay bubble parties.
[27:53.160 --> 27:59.160]  You know, I'm going to fall down and cry in the corner because I didn't get gang banged by 50 dudes at a time.
[27:59.160 --> 28:04.160]  No, I should have said, I don't know who you are. You're the Feringi ambassador.
[28:04.160 --> 28:11.160]  But anyways, let's get serious. Here is Chuck Todd. We'll go out to break with it. Talking about Trump just wants a PR victory in North Korea.
[28:11.160 --> 28:14.160]  He's already had a victory done by, here it is.
[28:14.160 --> 28:21.160]  I think the president's just looking for good press. I mean, let's just be frank. He felt like he got a good press after the last one.
[28:21.160 --> 28:29.160]  And he figures another photo op might do that, but it does look like there's really not a lot to, I mean, I think he wants to be able to say something.
[28:29.160 --> 28:35.160]  I ended the Korean War, right? That's technically not happened. Maybe he walks away from that.
[28:35.160 --> 28:40.160]  But I'll be honest, Willie, it is telling to me that the National Security Advisor, John Bolton, is not even going.
[28:40.160 --> 28:41.160]  Right.
[28:41.160 --> 28:47.160]  Now, he says he's staying back to monitor events of Venezuela. Not an insignificant thing going on there. Don't get me wrong.
[28:47.160 --> 28:52.160]  That's enough of this bull. Yeah, because he's not going because he's not in charge of that.
[28:52.160 --> 28:59.160]  He is in charge, which is unfortunate of the Venezuela situation. Stay with us. We'll be right back.
[29:22.160 --> 29:26.160]  My blood pressure has normalized. My diabetes has totally improved.
[29:26.160 --> 29:33.160]  Everyone is telling me now how much healthier I look and I'm telling everyone how much healthier I feel. I recommend heart and body extract to everyone.
[29:33.160 --> 29:52.160]  Anybody over 40 in the North American continent should be using this product as a preventative to keep their cardiovascular system healthy.
[30:03.160 --> 30:18.160]  By leaps and by bounds, the number one best-selling supplement family in the world is energy drinks and energy supplements.
[30:18.160 --> 30:28.160]  But they are riddled with dyes and toxins and synthetic caffeine and other chemicals that sure get you a quick boost but burn out in just a few hours and have terrible side effects.
[30:28.160 --> 30:37.160]  We have developed, hands down, from our research, the most powerful, healthy energy drink pre-workout and beyond system in the world.

[32:20.160 --> 32:26.160]  Leftist authoritarians like the young turds and others get so butt hurt when Trump won.
[32:26.160 --> 32:32.160]  They don't want us to have that victory. They don't want us to remember what political action did.
[32:32.160 --> 32:36.160]  And that's why the globalist Hillary and others are trying to shut InfoWars down.
[32:36.160 --> 32:43.160]  This is a fight about taking your speech away, not just my speech, about taking your very sovereignty away.
[32:43.160 --> 32:45.160]  This country is in a war.
[32:45.160 --> 32:50.160]  So again, I want to thank you for what you've done, but I want to remind you, if you don't spread the articles and videos,
[32:50.160 --> 32:55.160]  and if you don't financially get the great products we have and fund us and the 360 win, we're dead in the water.
[32:55.160 --> 33:19.160]  I'm in your hands. You're in my hands. InfoWarsStore.com. Thank you.
[33:25.160 --> 33:29.160]  This is Alex Jones.
[33:55.160 --> 34:03.160]  We're going to give up nuclear weapons so we can free his people and build some hotels and some factories.
[34:03.160 --> 34:08.160]  South Korea is the most productive country in the world.
[34:08.160 --> 34:14.160]  Per capita, their citizens are the most wealthy in the world, the most employed in the world.
[34:14.160 --> 34:17.160]  They have a lot of top statistics.
[34:17.160 --> 34:23.160]  They also follow rules and take every vaccine recommended, which is about 70 over there,
[34:23.160 --> 34:31.160]  and they have the highest rate of autism, one in 23.
[34:31.160 --> 34:38.160]  Might want to know that little fact, but there you go, ladies and gentlemen.
[34:38.160 --> 34:45.160]  Air Force One is in the air, and Chuck Todd, I don't normally play clips twice back to back,
[34:45.160 --> 34:52.160]  but let's do this one more time because Chuck Todd is beside himself, the Clinton Obama operative,
[34:52.160 --> 34:56.160]  trying to act like Trump's doing a terrible job on North Korea,
[34:56.160 --> 35:02.160]  trying to act like that this is all just a stunt.
[35:02.160 --> 35:08.160]  Trump is looking for good press, and then he says because Bolton,
[35:08.160 --> 35:14.160]  man, it looks like he has a dust broom for a mustache,
[35:14.160 --> 35:21.160]  Bolton, the neocon, is staying behind to try to get Venezuelan regime change going.
[35:21.160 --> 35:24.160]  So because Bolton's not going, this means nothing.
[35:24.160 --> 35:27.160]  We've already gotten Kim Jong-un to destroy major nuclear sites
[35:27.160 --> 35:33.160]  and did not fire missiles over Japan with Japan threatening military action.
[35:33.160 --> 35:41.160]  That's why the Japanese president has nominated Trump for the Nobel Peace Prize,
[35:41.160 --> 35:45.160]  and I think Trump does deserve one for trying and getting some success.
[35:45.160 --> 35:51.160]  I mean, especially if Obama wasn't even in office yet when he was given the Nobel Prize.
[35:51.160 --> 35:55.160]  And then, of course, Henry Kissinger got one, a warmonger.
[35:55.160 --> 35:58.160]  I mean, I think President Trump really ought to probably turn it down
[35:58.160 --> 36:01.160]  because they've turned it into a joke giving one to Al Gore, you name it.
[36:01.160 --> 36:09.160]  But finally, they could reprieve themselves being avant-garde and actually supporting someone
[36:09.160 --> 36:13.160]  who's actually trying to denuclearize the Korean Peninsula.
[36:13.160 --> 36:19.160]  But I wouldn't hold your breath, but here's Chuck Todd really having trouble getting it out
[36:19.160 --> 36:21.160]  because he knows it's such a bull.
[36:21.160 --> 36:25.160]  He knows what Trump is doing is so bold, here he is trying to invert reality.
[36:25.160 --> 36:28.160]  I think the president's just looking for good press.
[36:28.160 --> 36:30.160]  I mean, let's just be frank.
[36:30.160 --> 36:36.160]  He felt like he got a good press after the last one, and he figures another photo op might do that,
[36:36.160 --> 36:39.160]  but it does look like there's really not a lot to...
[36:39.160 --> 36:41.160]  I mean, I think he wants to be able to say something.
[36:41.160 --> 36:45.160]  I ended the Korean War, right? That's technically not happened.
[36:45.160 --> 36:48.160]  Maybe he walks away from that, but I'll be honest, Willie,
[36:48.160 --> 36:52.160]  it is telling to me that the National Security Advisor, John Bolton, is not even going.
[36:52.160 --> 36:53.160]  Right.
[36:53.160 --> 36:56.160]  Now, he says he's staying back to monitor events of Venezuela.
[36:56.160 --> 36:58.160]  Not an insignificant thing going on there.
[36:58.160 --> 36:59.160]  Don't get me wrong.
[36:59.160 --> 37:01.160]  Vice President going there to Colombia tomorrow.
[37:01.160 --> 37:06.160]  Very important for them to be monitoring that situation.
[37:06.160 --> 37:11.160]  But if something big was going to happen with North Korea, I promise you John Bolton would be there.
[37:11.160 --> 37:16.160]  Notice Chuck Todd said, let's be frank.
[37:16.160 --> 37:17.160]  We always have these little tricks.
[37:17.160 --> 37:22.160]  Let me be frank with you, which means I'm going to completely lie to you.
[37:22.160 --> 37:25.160]  Okay, there's almost too much news here for me to cover.
[37:25.160 --> 37:31.160]  One big tidbit that I'm not going to have time to air here today,
[37:31.160 --> 37:36.160]  but that I would direct you to, is infowars.com and newswars.com,
[37:36.160 --> 37:40.160]  where our great reporter and her team, Caitlin Bennett,
[37:40.160 --> 37:45.160]  have been truly on fire with two or three big viral reports a day,
[37:45.160 --> 37:49.160]  just going out and doing what Jay Walking did,
[37:49.160 --> 37:52.160]  or doing what Mark Dice did, or doing what I've done and others have done before,
[37:52.160 --> 37:56.160]  but just illustrating how out-of-control Democrats are.
[37:56.160 --> 38:00.160]  And there's a new video that's up on drugsreport.com.
[38:00.160 --> 38:05.160]  Students support concentration camps for Trump supporters.
[38:05.160 --> 38:09.160]  Almost all of them at the California University she visits.
[38:09.160 --> 38:15.160]  But there's two new videos today that are even more insane
[38:15.160 --> 38:19.160]  that I'm going to have added to that article that Drudges linked to.
[38:19.160 --> 38:21.160]  He played at the start of the show.
[38:21.160 --> 38:25.160]  She goes out and talks to, it looks like 50 people or so.
[38:25.160 --> 38:28.160]  I didn't count them up, but it's dozens and dozens and dozens.
[38:28.160 --> 38:31.160]  None of them know who the 45th president is out of 50.
[38:31.160 --> 38:34.160]  Only two of them do.
[38:34.160 --> 38:40.160]  And there's another video of standard black Israelite movement
[38:40.160 --> 38:43.160]  that she goes and interviews on the street in California.
[38:43.160 --> 38:47.160]  And I've been in Houston and I've been in Dallas and I've heard the same group
[38:47.160 --> 38:49.160]  for 20, 30 years.
[38:49.160 --> 38:51.160]  And I was in high school running under these guys.
[38:51.160 --> 38:53.160]  You'd walk out of the shopping mall and they'd say,
[38:53.160 --> 38:58.160]  it's a white devil, God will soon kill him soon.
[38:58.160 --> 39:04.160]  The devil seed, the white devil, the cave dweller.
[39:04.160 --> 39:07.160]  And when you watch this 10 minute video of them saying this to her
[39:07.160 --> 39:12.160]  that she needs to die, that she's inherently evil because her skin is pink.
[39:12.160 --> 39:19.160]  And calling her cave dweller, you have to understand this is the same religion
[39:19.160 --> 39:24.160]  or same cult that was screaming for up to 30 minutes at the Covington kids
[39:24.160 --> 39:29.160]  and they move away from where they were at the bus stop to another area
[39:29.160 --> 39:31.160]  and they come over and confront them.
[39:31.160 --> 39:36.160]  And then the media interviews the quote native elder who says,
[39:36.160 --> 39:41.160]  I saw the African American gentlemen and I wanted to protect them
[39:41.160 --> 39:43.160]  from these evil white people.
[39:43.160 --> 39:45.160]  That's a quote.
[39:45.160 --> 39:46.160]  He's aggressive.
[39:46.160 --> 39:54.160]  Meanwhile, he's on the tape with them telling him that he's going to hell
[39:54.160 --> 39:57.160]  because he's not a black Israelite.
[39:57.160 --> 40:00.160]  So they're on the tape telling the Native Americans and Mexicans
[40:00.160 --> 40:04.160]  and people out there, they suck and saying,
[40:04.160 --> 40:07.160]  we're going to kill you to the white kids.
[40:07.160 --> 40:10.160]  And the media takes that and turns them into the bad guys.
[40:10.160 --> 40:14.160]  Look, I know you already know all this.
[40:14.160 --> 40:19.160]  It's just crazy when you've actually listened to 10 minutes of them
[40:19.160 --> 40:24.160]  calling her a cave dweller and a subhuman devil and all the rest of it.
[40:24.160 --> 40:30.160]  And it just illustrates this whole epicenterology of saying whites are inherently bad.
[40:30.160 --> 40:38.160]  But we've got MSNBC hosts will play next segment saying Camilla Harris isn't black enough
[40:38.160 --> 40:43.160]  because her husband's white.
[40:43.160 --> 40:47.160]  That's like the Nazis saying, you know, well, you're not Jewish,
[40:47.160 --> 40:50.160]  but your husband is so you're both going to the concentration camp.
[40:50.160 --> 40:53.160]  The left is involved right now.
[40:53.160 --> 40:57.160]  I know you know this, but it bears repeating.
[40:57.160 --> 41:03.160]  They're literally converting to the most hardcore race based insanity I've ever seen
[41:03.160 --> 41:06.160]  and it's getting worse by the day.
[41:06.160 --> 41:09.160]  We're going to go to break and come back with all of that.
[41:09.160 --> 41:13.160]  Please remember listeners that without you supporting us, we won't be here.

[41:39.160 --> 41:40.160]  It's just not cold pressed.
[41:40.160 --> 41:43.160]  It technically is way stronger than super male vitality.
[41:43.160 --> 41:45.160]  A lot of folks still love super male vitality.
[41:45.160 --> 41:48.160]  I understand why it works really good, but Alpha Power is something really,
[41:48.160 --> 41:51.160]  really strong, really, really good for libido, energy stamina.

[41:58.160 --> 42:01.160]  Leading competitors have 3 to 5% and costs more.

[42:05.160 --> 42:09.160]  and it's got other key compounds naturally that help accelerate it into your body.

[43:03.160 --> 43:06.160]  The real drama can be found here in Leilani Estates.
[43:06.160 --> 43:09.160]  But a lot of us on the big island rely on rainwater
[43:09.160 --> 43:12.160]  and we need to be concerned about ash and acid rain.
[43:12.160 --> 43:16.160]  Volcanic ash may contain heavy metal particles.
[43:16.160 --> 43:20.160]  And acid rain could lower the pH of the water to unhealthy levels.
[43:20.160 --> 43:26.160]  To find out, we employed a series of tests for heavy metals, alkalinity, and pH.
[43:26.160 --> 43:30.160]  What we learned was that there was in fact unhealthy levels of heavy metals
[43:30.160 --> 43:32.160]  and acidity in the rainwater.
[43:32.160 --> 43:36.160]  Next, we tested the water from our Alexa pure gravity filter.
[43:36.160 --> 43:39.160]  And not only were the heavy metal levels within safe measure,
[43:39.160 --> 43:43.160]  but the pH was also restored to optimal levels.
[43:43.160 --> 43:48.160]  As it turns out, the filter on the Alexa pure raises the pH of the water.
[43:48.160 --> 43:54.160]  So what we've learned is that volcanic ash and acid rain can contaminate a rainwater supply.
[43:54.160 --> 43:59.160]  But more importantly, a good water filtration system will purify it.
[43:59.160 --> 44:02.160]  Our grandparents and great grandparents knew that they can't food.
[44:02.160 --> 44:05.160]  During the fall, they'd have it during the winter.
[44:05.160 --> 44:08.160]  And that's what I'm talking about at m4store.com.
[44:08.160 --> 44:12.160]  With m4 select, it's the full spectrum of my patriots supply
[44:12.160 --> 44:15.160]  one of the top most respected companies out there.
[44:15.160 --> 44:17.160]  But because I private label it,
[44:17.160 --> 44:20.160]  I'm able to go below cost on contracts
[44:20.160 --> 44:23.160]  that all their other distributors aren't able to do.
[44:23.160 --> 44:25.160]  But I want to be a market leader
[44:25.160 --> 44:28.160]  and I want you to have durable food so it's a total win-win.
[44:28.160 --> 44:32.160]  We have those incredible sell prices back at m4store.com

[44:36.160 --> 44:40.160]  They've got three month supplies, your supplies, weak emergency supplies.
[44:40.160 --> 44:42.160]  They've got so many great products there.
[44:42.160 --> 44:44.160]  Maybe you got a three year supply.
[44:44.160 --> 44:46.160]  If stuff happens, you can feed your whole block.
[44:46.160 --> 44:48.160]  It's up to us to be self-sufficient.
[44:48.160 --> 44:51.160]  If you're buying war bonds, bring you great products.
[44:51.160 --> 44:53.160]  And together with God's help, we are unstoppable.
[44:53.160 --> 45:02.160]  It's really hard to have the energy at the end of the day
[45:02.160 --> 45:06.160]  to still get to the gym or to go for a run or go to the park
[45:06.160 --> 45:08.160]  or heck even take your dogs for a walk.
[45:08.160 --> 45:11.160]  Believe me, I know I spend hours in front of a screen
[45:11.160 --> 45:14.160]  and then hours in front of bright lights every day.
[45:14.160 --> 45:18.160]  But thanks to supermail vitality at infowarstore.com,
[45:18.160 --> 45:20.160]  I still have that energy.
[45:20.160 --> 45:23.160]  There's no way I could have the energy at the end of a long day
[45:23.160 --> 45:26.160]  to fight back against the chemicals and the food and water
[45:26.160 --> 45:28.160]  to fight back against the modern day lifestyle
[45:28.160 --> 45:30.160]  with the screen time and the extended hours
[45:30.160 --> 45:34.160]  to still have the stamina and endurance, energy and drive
[45:34.160 --> 45:37.160]  to get to the gym, get to the park and get exercise

[47:48.160 --> 47:50.160]  We're here, the most dreaded, most demonized,
[47:50.160 --> 47:53.160]  most lied about broadcast in the world by tyrants,
[47:53.160 --> 47:56.160]  by communists, by socialists, by Hollywood trash,
[47:56.160 --> 47:59.160]  by devil worshipers, or hated by them.
[47:59.160 --> 48:02.160]  I want to get into the democratic party, though,
[48:02.160 --> 48:05.160]  and how it mirrors other authoritarian, socialist,
[48:05.160 --> 48:07.160]  and fascist and communist regimes,
[48:07.160 --> 48:09.160]  because it's always the same.
[48:09.160 --> 48:11.160]  It's a cult of power, a cult of dependence.
[48:11.160 --> 48:14.160]  They want you stupid, they want you done, done.
[48:14.160 --> 48:17.160]  Camilla Harris is in a lot of trouble for being
[48:17.160 --> 48:22.160]  a vicious prosecutor in the vein of Hillary Clinton
[48:22.160 --> 48:26.160]  who specifically, in the 1990s when they passed
[48:26.160 --> 48:30.160]  the Clinton crime bill, would give black people
[48:30.160 --> 48:32.160]  three times the sentences of white people.
[48:32.160 --> 48:34.160]  Now, Trump is reversing that,
[48:34.160 --> 48:37.160]  and the media gives him no credit for it.
[48:37.160 --> 48:42.160]  But Hillary said black people are super predators.
[48:42.160 --> 48:45.160]  They're like dogs, they must be brought to heel.
[48:45.160 --> 48:47.160]  I could play the video clip if you'd like.
[48:47.160 --> 48:49.160]  She played it many times, but she did that.
[48:49.160 --> 48:53.160]  So if you call blacks dogs, you're loved by the media,
[48:53.160 --> 48:55.160]  and then they try to keep blacks from finding that out.
[48:55.160 --> 48:57.160]  But people know about Camilla Harris,
[48:57.160 --> 49:00.160]  and a lot of folks that were out in San Francisco
[49:00.160 --> 49:03.160]  and around her have criticized her that worked with her
[49:03.160 --> 49:05.160]  and said she was a vicious authoritarian
[49:05.160 --> 49:07.160]  who really had a mainstream against black people.
[49:07.160 --> 49:10.160]  Well, her family was one of the most powerful families
[49:10.160 --> 49:15.160]  of slave owners in Jamaica.
[49:15.160 --> 49:18.160]  And you do know the first person to get a license
[49:18.160 --> 49:21.160]  in Virginia by the British government for slaves
[49:21.160 --> 49:22.160]  was a black man.
[49:22.160 --> 49:25.160]  I mean, the idea that only blacks have been slaves
[49:25.160 --> 49:27.160]  or that blacks didn't have black slaves
[49:27.160 --> 49:29.160]  is absolute horsemaner.
[49:29.160 --> 49:31.160]  You read any of the history books,
[49:31.160 --> 49:35.160]  some of the biggest plantation owners in the Caribbean,
[49:35.160 --> 49:36.160]  with sugar cane.
[49:36.160 --> 49:38.160]  That's where you really had the big black slave populations.
[49:38.160 --> 49:40.160]  Why do you think when you go to the Caribbean
[49:40.160 --> 49:42.160]  there's black people everywhere?
[49:42.160 --> 49:43.160]  Or you go to Brazil?
[49:43.160 --> 49:47.160]  Because they were brought there as slaves.
[49:47.160 --> 49:50.160]  And a lot of them were owned by black people.
[49:50.160 --> 49:55.160]  So that's what we're talking about here, ladies and gentlemen.
[49:55.160 --> 49:58.160]  And one of the most powerful families in Jamaica
[49:58.160 --> 49:59.160]  is who she comes from.
[49:59.160 --> 50:01.160]  So it's just, she's married to a white guy.
[50:01.160 --> 50:04.160]  She's a hardcore prosecutor.
[50:04.160 --> 50:09.160]  And in the age of race baiting that the left pushes,
[50:09.160 --> 50:11.160]  it's all supposed to be about optics.
[50:11.160 --> 50:13.160]  So here's an MSNBC pundit.
[50:13.160 --> 50:16.160]  Full video is up on infowars.com
[50:16.160 --> 50:19.160]  saying that, well, you know, she does have a problem
[50:19.160 --> 50:21.160]  because her husband is white.
[50:21.160 --> 50:23.160]  Here it is.
[50:23.160 --> 50:25.160]  Black men, blue collar black men,
[50:25.160 --> 50:27.160]  they're going to have a problem with her record.
[50:27.160 --> 50:29.160]  And you're right, cream, she's not the only person.
[50:29.160 --> 50:32.160]  But I will say I think the African-American community
[50:32.160 --> 50:34.160]  expects more from people who looks like us,
[50:34.160 --> 50:36.160]  particularly a candidate who wants to represent us.
[50:36.160 --> 50:39.160]  So she needs to find a strong black man advocate
[50:39.160 --> 50:42.160]  who can be in her corner at some point on the campaign,
[50:42.160 --> 50:45.160]  at some point in any space in her campaign
[50:45.160 --> 50:48.160]  that I would say that was my key advice.
[50:48.160 --> 50:50.160]  Okay.
[50:50.160 --> 50:53.160]  Now let's go to Merman,
[50:53.160 --> 50:56.160]  who is head of a major committee over banking.
[50:56.160 --> 50:58.160]  I'm sorry, not Merman.
[50:58.160 --> 51:00.160]  What's its name?
[51:00.160 --> 51:02.160]  Oh, yeah.
[51:02.160 --> 51:05.160]  Its husband got tens of millions of dollars stolen from her
[51:05.160 --> 51:07.160]  as a banker bailout.
[51:07.160 --> 51:10.160]  Maxine Waters.
[51:10.160 --> 51:13.160]  Maxine Waters says, a black woman's got the gavel.
[51:13.160 --> 51:16.160]  Look out, it's going to be heard around the world.
[51:16.160 --> 51:19.160]  Well, lady, you don't look like a black woman to me.
[51:19.160 --> 51:23.160]  I mean, you look like the creature from the black lagoon,
[51:23.160 --> 51:25.160]  but it had green skin.
[51:25.160 --> 51:31.160]  So, again, I'm not saying you're the creature
[51:31.160 --> 51:33.160]  because the black lagoon is black, it's a green creature.
[51:33.160 --> 51:35.160]  But you do look like its cousin.
[51:35.160 --> 51:38.160]  I mean, you do look like the creature from the black lagoon.
[51:38.160 --> 51:40.160]  I'm sorry, can we pull up the creature from the black lagoon
[51:40.160 --> 51:42.160]  and play it next to her?
[51:42.160 --> 51:44.160]  I mean, I'm not being mean here.
[51:44.160 --> 51:46.160]  It's just she's so crazy looking.
[51:46.160 --> 51:49.160]  Who's the famous black singer?
[51:49.160 --> 51:52.160]  Who's coming to America?
[51:52.160 --> 51:54.160]  Yeah, coast to coast.
[51:54.160 --> 51:56.160]  James Brown.
[51:56.160 --> 51:59.160]  She looks like a cross between the creature from the black lagoon
[51:59.160 --> 52:00.160]  and James Brown.
[52:00.160 --> 52:02.160]  It's a fact.
[52:02.160 --> 52:04.160]  That's what she looks like.
[52:04.160 --> 52:06.160]  I look like a sea captain.
[52:06.160 --> 52:10.160]  When somebody looks like something, there you go.
[52:10.160 --> 52:14.160]  So, let's be fair.
[52:14.160 --> 52:16.160]  She looks more like James Brown.
[52:16.160 --> 52:18.160]  But James Brown's a little more lovable.
[52:18.160 --> 52:20.160]  He was a super anti-white racist,
[52:20.160 --> 52:22.160]  but, you know, who else takes five hits LSD
[52:22.160 --> 52:25.160]  and drives 150 miles an hour and F-150 pickup?
[52:25.160 --> 52:27.160]  I mean, you kind of got to love that a little bit, don't you?
[52:27.160 --> 52:29.160]  All right, I'm digressing, and I really apologize
[52:29.160 --> 52:31.160]  for getting silly here.
[52:31.160 --> 52:35.160]  If you did put that wig on the creature from the black lagoon's head,
[52:35.160 --> 52:37.160]  it would be a spitting image.
[52:37.160 --> 52:39.160]  But here she is.
[52:39.160 --> 52:41.160]  She doesn't say the jig is up.
[52:41.160 --> 52:43.160]  She says the gig is up.
[52:43.160 --> 52:45.160]  I don't know who's more senile.
[52:45.160 --> 52:47.160]  Her or Nancy Pelosi?
[52:47.160 --> 52:49.160]  You know, Nancy Pelosi kind of looks like the creature
[52:49.160 --> 52:52.160]  from the black lagoon meets it, the clown, right?
[52:52.160 --> 52:54.160]  Sorry, I'm digressing.
[52:54.160 --> 52:56.160]  It's not what they look like. It's how they act.
[52:56.160 --> 52:58.160]  So, here she is saying, look out!
[52:58.160 --> 53:01.160]  A black woman's got the gavel.
[53:01.160 --> 53:03.160]  The gig is up.
[53:03.160 --> 53:05.160]  Today is it.
[53:05.160 --> 53:21.160]  I want this day to go down in honor of Reverend Jesse Jackson
[53:21.160 --> 53:26.160]  in ways that is described as this is a new day.
[53:26.160 --> 53:32.160]  This is a new day, and we're not simply begging.
[53:32.160 --> 53:34.160]  We're not simply pleading.
[53:34.160 --> 53:37.160]  The black woman has the gavel now.
[53:37.160 --> 53:40.160]  Yeah, I feel good.
[53:40.160 --> 53:42.160]  I got something.
[53:42.160 --> 53:44.160]  Something to tell me what to do.
[53:44.160 --> 53:46.160]  Something to tell me what it's all about.
[53:46.160 --> 53:48.160]  Experience too much.
[53:48.160 --> 53:50.160]  Struggle too hard.
[53:50.160 --> 53:52.160]  Not to use it.
[53:52.160 --> 53:57.160]  They will hear the sound of my gavel all over the world.
[53:57.160 --> 54:00.160]  So, there you go. We the bosses, we the bosses.
[54:00.160 --> 54:03.160]  I wish we had a black lady that was pro-gun, pro-free market.
[54:03.160 --> 54:05.160]  You are a monster.
[54:05.160 --> 54:08.160]  Not because you're black, but because you're a monster.
[54:08.160 --> 54:10.160]  Hitler wasn't bad because he was white.
[54:10.160 --> 54:12.160]  He was bad because he was Hitler.
[54:12.160 --> 54:15.160]  Here's another power-crazed minion saying,
[54:15.160 --> 54:17.160]  hey, I got the gavel and you don't.
[54:17.160 --> 54:19.160]  I got the microphone. I'm in charge.
[54:19.160 --> 54:21.160]  What are you going to do about that?
[54:21.160 --> 54:23.160]  Talking about AOC, baby.
[54:23.160 --> 54:26.160]  It's like, you know, it's your worst fear.
[54:26.160 --> 54:29.160]  Especially when you feel like imposter syndrome.
[54:29.160 --> 54:31.160]  It was your worst fear.
[54:31.160 --> 54:34.160]  You're feeling like someone was going to find you out as a fraud.
[54:34.160 --> 54:37.160]  And I read it and I was like, you know what?
[54:37.160 --> 54:39.160]  I don't care anymore.
[54:39.160 --> 54:41.160]  I don't care anymore.
[54:41.160 --> 54:44.160]  Because, again, I'm at least trying.
[54:44.160 --> 54:46.160]  And they're not.
[54:46.160 --> 54:50.160]  So, the power is in the person who's trying,
[54:50.160 --> 54:52.160]  regardless of the success.
[54:52.160 --> 54:55.160]  If you're trying, you've got all the power.
[54:55.160 --> 54:58.160]  You're driving the agenda. You're doing all this stuff.
[54:58.160 --> 55:01.160]  I just introduced Green New Deal two weeks ago.
[55:01.160 --> 55:04.160]  And it's creating all of this conversation.
[55:04.160 --> 55:07.160]  Why? Because no one else has even tried.
[55:07.160 --> 55:09.160]  Because no one else has even tried.
[55:09.160 --> 55:11.160]  So, people are like, oh, it's unrealistic.
[55:11.160 --> 55:15.160]  Oh, it's vague. Oh, it doesn't address this little minute thing.
[55:15.160 --> 55:17.160]  And I'm like, you try.
[55:17.160 --> 55:19.160]  You do it.
[55:19.160 --> 55:21.160]  Because you're not.
[55:21.160 --> 55:23.160]  Because you're not.
[55:23.160 --> 55:26.160]  So, until you do it, I'm the boss.
[55:26.160 --> 55:28.160]  I'm the boss. We the bosses.
[55:28.160 --> 55:30.160]  Think about that.
[55:30.160 --> 55:32.160]  We're going to get rid of airplanes.
[55:32.160 --> 55:34.160]  We don't want to work. You don't have to work.
[55:34.160 --> 55:36.160]  And then she tried to say she didn't say that.
[55:36.160 --> 55:38.160]  Or didn't write that.
[55:38.160 --> 55:40.160]  And the world's going to end in 12 months.
[55:40.160 --> 55:42.160]  And we can't have kids anymore.
[55:42.160 --> 55:44.160]  And you can't have hamburgers.
[55:44.160 --> 55:46.160]  And Cory Booker's like, listen.
[55:46.160 --> 55:48.160]  You're not going to be eating meat anymore.
[55:48.160 --> 55:50.160]  I'm telling you. Just get ready.
[55:50.160 --> 55:52.160]  You talk about control freaks.
[55:52.160 --> 55:54.160]  But that is what socials do. They take your food.
[55:54.160 --> 55:57.160]  And here's actual footage inside the Democratic Party.
[55:57.160 --> 56:02.160]  As Maxine Waters and others, like AOC, announced their takeover.
[56:02.160 --> 56:06.160]  Here's actual coup discussion footage. Here it is.
[56:11.160 --> 56:14.160]  Carlos, what are you up to?
[56:14.160 --> 56:20.160]  It's called a coup d'etat, which is a French for coup d'etat.
[56:20.160 --> 56:23.160]  But Carlos, you've been my most trusted number two for years.
[56:23.160 --> 56:26.160]  Well, guess what? I am sick of doing number two.
[56:26.160 --> 56:29.160]  It is our time for number one.
[56:29.160 --> 56:31.160]  Read your bosses now.
[56:31.160 --> 56:33.160]  Read your bosses. Read your bosses.
[56:35.160 --> 56:38.160]  Okay. I wish you were a boss that believed in
[56:38.160 --> 56:41.160]  lower taxes for the average person, less regulation.
[56:41.160 --> 56:45.160]  Oh, but China has lower taxes than us and no regulation.
[56:45.160 --> 56:47.160]  And you wonder why they're so successful.
[56:47.160 --> 56:50.160]  We've been set up. We've been sold out.
[56:50.160 --> 56:53.160]  And this woman's offering people free healthcare, free school,
[56:53.160 --> 56:55.160]  free reparations, and quote,
[56:55.160 --> 57:00.160]  if you're unable to work or don't want to work, you get a free paycheck.
[57:00.160 --> 57:03.160]  Wow. That sounds like a disaster, doesn't it?
[57:03.160 --> 57:06.160]  Oh my gosh.
[57:06.160 --> 57:09.160]  Don't worry though. She says eat fewer hamburgers
[57:09.160 --> 57:12.160]  and she's backed by people like Bloomberg.
[57:12.160 --> 57:15.160]  And yeah, a lot of us probably should eat fewer hamburgers.
[57:15.160 --> 57:17.160]  I had one for breakfast. I can't help it.
[57:17.160 --> 57:21.160]  But you know what? I don't need you, Mrs. Methmouth, to tell me
[57:21.160 --> 57:23.160]  you could eat a few more hamburgers, lady.
[57:23.160 --> 57:27.160]  You should look good. You look like a damn crack whore now.
[57:27.160 --> 57:29.160]  Get yourself together.
[57:29.160 --> 57:31.160]  We'll be right back with hour number two.
[57:31.160 --> 57:33.160]  Big guest lined up. Haven't told you about those yet.
[57:33.160 --> 57:35.160]  Summon Studio. Big surprises coming up in the next two days.
[57:35.160 --> 57:38.160]  And don't forget a bunch of big super combo deals
[57:38.160 --> 57:41.160]  at infowarstore.com. Get some t-shirts. Get some water filters.
[57:41.160 --> 57:44.160]  Support the Info War. We are fighting the globalists
[57:44.160 --> 57:46.160]  toe to toe. Without you, they're going to win.
[57:46.160 --> 57:48.160]  With your help, we all win together.
[57:58.160 --> 58:00.160]  By leaps and by bounds,
[58:00.160 --> 58:04.160]  the number one best-selling supplement family in the world
[58:04.160 --> 58:07.160]  is energy drinks and energy supplements.
[58:07.160 --> 58:10.160]  But they are riddled with dyes and toxins
[58:10.160 --> 58:12.160]  and synthetic caffeine and other chemicals
[58:12.160 --> 58:14.160]  that sure get you a quick boost
[58:14.160 --> 58:16.160]  but burn out in just a few hours
[58:16.160 --> 58:18.160]  and have terrible side effects.
[58:18.160 --> 58:20.160]  We have developed, hands down, from our research,
[58:20.160 --> 58:23.160]  the most powerful, healthy energy drink,
[58:23.160 --> 58:26.160]  pre-workout and beyond system in the world.
[58:26.160 --> 58:28.160]  There's nothing else like it.
[58:28.160 --> 58:31.160]  You must experience it. It is a total game changer.
[58:31.160 --> 58:33.160]  And it comes in easy-to-use packets
[58:33.160 --> 58:36.160]  to mix in with fruit juice or water, whatever you'd like.
[58:36.160 --> 58:38.160]  Warning, though. It's very, very strong.
[58:38.160 --> 58:41.160]  It lasts 10 hours. So take a half packet the first time you take it
[58:41.160 --> 58:46.160]  because Turboforce is named Turboforce because it will take you into overdrive.
[58:46.160 --> 59:15.160]  Turboforce and M4sLive.com
[59:16.160 --> 59:19.160]  Removing 220 plus contaminants from your water.
[59:19.160 --> 59:22.160]  It's compact in size, easy to install and maintain,
[59:22.160 --> 59:26.160]  and keeps fluoride and other dangerous toxins out of your water supply
[59:26.160 --> 59:28.160]  and away from you and your family.
[59:28.160 --> 59:31.160]  With its broad spectrum contaminant reduction,
[59:31.160 --> 59:36.160]  you'll only need this one filter for clean and refreshing water all over your home.
[59:36.160 --> 59:38.160]  Head to infowarstore.com
[59:38.160 --> 59:41.160]  and whether it's your first water filtration purchase
[59:41.160 --> 59:44.160]  or you're looking to replace your current rundown systems,
[59:44.160 --> 59:50.160]  it's time to go big and go home with the Pro Pure Hole House filtration system today.
[59:50.160 --> 1:00:19.160]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[1:00:20.160 --> 1:00:38.160]  That's Maxine Waters.
[1:00:38.160 --> 1:00:48.160]  She wants you to know she's getting close to nuclear weapons arsenal.
[1:00:48.160 --> 1:00:51.160]  Let's get serious.
[1:00:51.160 --> 1:00:55.160]  We can look at AOC, we can look at Maxine Waters, we can look at Nancy Pelosi
[1:00:55.160 --> 1:00:59.160]  and we can say what planet do people like Michael Morgan, these folks, come from
[1:00:59.160 --> 1:01:02.160]  and we know where they come from.
[1:01:02.160 --> 1:01:06.160]  Big blue toilet bowls.
[1:01:06.160 --> 1:01:11.160]  Every statistic on the planet is socialist and communist and leftist areas
[1:01:11.160 --> 1:01:15.160]  have super ultra-rich perched on top of them
[1:01:15.160 --> 1:01:23.160]  with mindless mobs of drug addicts, needles and human feces and bankruptcy all around them.
[1:01:23.160 --> 1:01:26.160]  And then I do need to go tell some of the video researchers and editors
[1:01:26.160 --> 1:01:32.160]  we've got to take that six-minute piece I never got to yesterday, a Bill Maher,
[1:01:32.160 --> 1:01:40.160]  putting down flyover country as a hellhole
[1:01:40.160 --> 1:01:46.160]  and saying that everyone in flyover country wants to live in California
[1:01:46.160 --> 1:01:50.160]  or in New York, total inversion of reality.
[1:01:50.160 --> 1:01:52.160]  Because all the statistics show the opposite.
[1:01:52.160 --> 1:01:58.160]  Everyone's fleeing from the east coast and the west coast, the northeast,
[1:01:58.160 --> 1:02:02.160]  to the south and to the Midwest and to Texas
[1:02:02.160 --> 1:02:07.160]  and everyone's fleeing from the west coast towards Texas.
[1:02:07.160 --> 1:02:11.160]  I mean, hell, they're having booms in Nebraska.
[1:02:11.160 --> 1:02:16.160]  I looked at Nebraska to visit my wife's dad
[1:02:16.160 --> 1:02:21.160]  and the people are all super nice and they've got big nice houses on lakes
[1:02:21.160 --> 1:02:24.160]  and they're just middle-class people
[1:02:24.160 --> 1:02:27.160]  and you look over and their neighbors have got a big nice house
[1:02:27.160 --> 1:02:31.160]  and they're black and other neighbors are Chinese and they're all just Americans
[1:02:31.160 --> 1:02:35.160]  and there's just highways being built and businesses and factories everywhere
[1:02:35.160 --> 1:02:45.160]  and that's all because, oh yeah, everybody's fleeing here from New Jersey, New York, California.
[1:02:45.160 --> 1:02:50.160]  And they're having a boom up there and you go other places and they're having booms
[1:02:50.160 --> 1:02:57.160]  because people are getting the hell out of California especially.
[1:02:57.160 --> 1:02:59.160]  You're like, well, California's population keeps going.
[1:02:59.160 --> 1:03:05.160]  Oh no, they're replacing it with the lowest skilled, lowest IQ people.
[1:03:05.160 --> 1:03:08.160]  There's not a brain drain happening out of Latin America.
[1:03:08.160 --> 1:03:11.160]  There's rich ruling class there, super rich people all over the place.
[1:03:11.160 --> 1:03:14.160]  I mean, you go to Mexico, you go to the nice barriers,
[1:03:14.160 --> 1:03:18.160]  there's all these rich people and they're all, you know, living better than rich people in the U.S.
[1:03:18.160 --> 1:03:23.160]  but there's a giant permanent underclass
[1:03:23.160 --> 1:03:25.160]  and that's the system we're moving into
[1:03:25.160 --> 1:03:32.160]  and so the permanent underclass is moving here.
[1:03:32.160 --> 1:03:34.160]  Or we're just purely exploited.
[1:03:34.160 --> 1:03:37.160]  You know, I mean, I talk about this a lot but it's incredible.
[1:03:37.160 --> 1:03:45.160]  For at least five years, the number one group coming to the U.S. legally is not Mexicans.
[1:03:45.160 --> 1:03:49.160]  It's Chinese women, middle class.
[1:03:49.160 --> 1:03:55.160]  Their government encourages them to fly here a month before they give birth,
[1:03:55.160 --> 1:04:01.160]  check into a hotel, they'll have the baby, have it all paid for as an anchor baby,
[1:04:01.160 --> 1:04:04.160]  say, I don't have insurance, I'm just here visiting
[1:04:04.160 --> 1:04:09.160]  and then the baby, the $30,000 births paid for on average
[1:04:09.160 --> 1:04:13.160]  and the kid is a U.S. citizen.
[1:04:13.160 --> 1:04:17.160]  And then they sign up for a bunch of welfare
[1:04:17.160 --> 1:04:20.160]  and the woman stays here
[1:04:20.160 --> 1:04:24.160]  and usually the Chinese businessman goes back and forth doing his Chinese business
[1:04:24.160 --> 1:04:29.160]  and then his house and his car and his U.S. base is all paid for
[1:04:29.160 --> 1:04:32.160]  and it's a subsidy the Chinese government has.
[1:04:32.160 --> 1:04:35.160]  Remember like six, seven years ago Walmart internal memo came out where they told employees,
[1:04:35.160 --> 1:04:38.160]  oh no, we don't pay you enough to actually be out of poverty
[1:04:38.160 --> 1:04:40.160]  because we want you to be able to get welfare too
[1:04:40.160 --> 1:04:42.160]  and they'll have a better life.
[1:04:42.160 --> 1:04:45.160]  No, Walmart subsidized by food stamps and welfare.
[1:04:45.160 --> 1:04:47.160]  It's the same crap.
[1:04:47.160 --> 1:04:50.160]  And that's why all these big billionaires are for socialism and communism
[1:04:50.160 --> 1:04:53.160]  is because they all get government incentives.
[1:04:53.160 --> 1:04:55.160]  They all get government kickbacks.
[1:04:55.160 --> 1:05:24.160]  It's all rigged.
[1:05:25.160 --> 1:05:31.160]  Simply take a packet, mix it into the indicated amount of water and enjoy.
[1:05:31.160 --> 1:05:34.160]  With 14 servings per box for a two week or more supply,
[1:05:34.160 --> 1:05:39.160]  this is the formula to stock up on whenever you need a boost.
[1:05:39.160 --> 1:05:42.160]  Perfect for work, in the car, or at home.
[1:05:42.160 --> 1:05:45.160]  Turboforce is the ultimate answer to a sluggish day.
[1:05:45.160 --> 1:05:47.160]  Don't let your day slow you down.
[1:05:47.160 --> 1:05:57.160]  Perk Up with Turboforce at infowarstore.com
[1:06:17.160 --> 1:06:30.160]  Hey little sister, what have you done?
[1:06:30.160 --> 1:06:37.160]  Hey little sister, who's the only one?
[1:06:37.160 --> 1:06:43.160]  Hey little sister, who's your Superman?
[1:06:43.160 --> 1:06:47.160]  Hey little sister, who's the one you want?
[1:06:47.160 --> 1:06:52.160]  Hey little sister, shotgun.
[1:06:52.160 --> 1:06:54.160]  Okay, here's what I want to do.
[1:06:54.160 --> 1:06:58.160]  I've got a ton of news and a bunch of clips I want to get to on this Monday,
[1:06:58.160 --> 1:07:01.160]  February 25th, 2019, global transmission.
[1:07:01.160 --> 1:07:08.160]  But I want to open the phones up specifically on Trump and the North Korea second summit.
[1:07:08.160 --> 1:07:12.160]  Do you think it's a victory for America and for Trump?
[1:07:12.160 --> 1:07:15.160]  Do you think Kim Jong-un is playing us?
[1:07:15.160 --> 1:07:19.160]  I just know the globalists have that ongoing strategy of quote, patience,
[1:07:19.160 --> 1:07:26.160]  where they want to keep the peninsula locked up, let China take control of North Korea, keep it suppressed.
[1:07:26.160 --> 1:07:31.160]  If the U.S. could cut North Korea out from the Chai comms and industrialize it
[1:07:31.160 --> 1:07:40.160]  and get their establishment to free their people and become incredibly rich in the process,
[1:07:40.160 --> 1:07:44.160]  then even a crony capitalist model like that would be light years better
[1:07:44.160 --> 1:07:51.160]  than living under a Stalinist nightmare that's 50 years in the past
[1:07:51.160 --> 1:07:55.160]  with abuse and torture and things just unprecedented.
[1:07:55.160 --> 1:08:03.160]  So I see this as a big gamble of the president and I see it as him being a troublemaker.
[1:08:03.160 --> 1:08:05.160]  But do you think it will be successful?
[1:08:05.160 --> 1:08:09.160]  He's already got him to stop firing the missiles and at least destroy some nuclear sites.
[1:08:09.160 --> 1:08:10.160]  It's a big start.
[1:08:10.160 --> 1:08:14.160]  Now we don't have the North and South shooting at each other every few days.
[1:08:14.160 --> 1:08:18.160]  So there's already been a giant de-escalation 50 plus years after the ceasefire.
[1:08:18.160 --> 1:08:23.160]  And to see Chuck Todd and others saying, oh, this is just Trump grandstanding for publicity,
[1:08:23.160 --> 1:08:28.160]  that's not true, he's taking a major risk here.
[1:08:28.160 --> 1:08:29.160]  So we'll talk about that subject.
[1:08:29.160 --> 1:08:30.160]  What do you think about Venezuela?
[1:08:30.160 --> 1:08:33.160]  That's probably even more important in the immediate future.
[1:08:33.160 --> 1:08:41.160]  Maduro has staged these elections, he's been caught, Tigo Chavez robbed the population,
[1:08:41.160 --> 1:08:42.160]  destroyed the country.
[1:08:42.160 --> 1:08:45.160]  Now you've got food convoys that Maduro took credit for.
[1:08:45.160 --> 1:08:49.160]  I thought it could have been a false flag by Columbia or something.
[1:08:49.160 --> 1:08:53.160]  Because Columbia really doesn't like, you know, it's a neighbor of Venezuela,
[1:08:53.160 --> 1:08:56.160]  flooding him with crime and refugees and all the rest of it.
[1:08:56.160 --> 1:09:02.160]  So Maduro has Russian troops, Chinese troops, Iranian ships coming in.
[1:09:02.160 --> 1:09:05.160]  This is a big escalation.
[1:09:05.160 --> 1:09:11.160]  And Maduro's taking credit saying we will not be beggars, we blew up these trucks,
[1:09:11.160 --> 1:09:15.160]  we're not taking America's food.
[1:09:15.160 --> 1:09:22.160]  So he deserves, just for that to be removed, but you've seen how regime change always goes bad,
[1:09:22.160 --> 1:09:28.160]  because the neocons who are involved in this with the Democrats, they never want to see something fixed.
[1:09:28.160 --> 1:09:31.160]  They like a strategy attention, they like to stir the pot.
[1:09:31.160 --> 1:09:38.160]  They want the crisis to continue like what they've done in the Middle East and North Africa and the whole Arab Spring.
[1:09:38.160 --> 1:09:47.160]  So I don't trust Bolton and some of these other guys that are involved.
[1:09:47.160 --> 1:09:50.160]  But regardless, Maduro is so bad.
[1:09:50.160 --> 1:10:04.160]  That's why it's a terrible thing that the Feringa ambassador, Marco Rubio, tweeted at Maduro
[1:10:04.160 --> 1:10:12.160]  and basically put out a tweet showing Gaddafi alive and then Gaddafi being tortured to death
[1:10:12.160 --> 1:10:20.160]  by the Al Qaeda forces that as a neocon he supported Hillary in sending in to blow that country up and have regime change.
[1:10:20.160 --> 1:10:24.160]  After he'd made a deal with us eight years before, invested in the West and opened himself up to the West
[1:10:24.160 --> 1:10:26.160]  and thought Obama was his friend.
[1:10:26.160 --> 1:10:30.160]  Total betrayal. That was evil. That's bad regime change.
[1:10:30.160 --> 1:10:36.160]  And so when the same people like Marco Rubio are supporting and getting rid of Maduro,
[1:10:36.160 --> 1:10:42.160]  it just makes me wonder because I want to see Maduro gone.
[1:10:42.160 --> 1:10:53.160]  Venezuela was always in first or second place in the world or in this hemisphere as the richest country in the Americas.
[1:10:53.160 --> 1:11:00.160]  From Alaska down to the tip of Chile, it was as wealthy as the U.S. or wealthier on average.
[1:11:00.160 --> 1:11:06.160]  The average person had an income higher than the people in the U.S. until the 60s.
[1:11:06.160 --> 1:11:12.160]  Same thing for Argentina, the Argentines.
[1:11:12.160 --> 1:11:18.160]  And Argentina now has been wrecked and never came out of it because the bankers come in,
[1:11:18.160 --> 1:11:22.160]  they get you in their monetary fractional reserve system, they set you up,
[1:11:22.160 --> 1:11:28.160]  they destroy middle classes to control and dominate and vertically integrate society.
[1:11:28.160 --> 1:11:34.160]  And so I want to see Maduro gone.
[1:11:34.160 --> 1:11:38.160]  It's a horrible communist regime, not just socialist.
[1:11:38.160 --> 1:11:40.160]  But I don't know.
[1:11:40.160 --> 1:11:42.160]  I don't know what's going to happen. Here's some of these headlines.
[1:11:42.160 --> 1:11:50.160]  After Venezuelan troops blockade, Maduro faces diplomatic siege.
[1:11:50.160 --> 1:11:56.160]  Shocking intel. U.S., and this is true, is massing troops and weapons in Colombia.
[1:11:56.160 --> 1:12:00.160]  That's why Mike Pence, the vice president, is there right now.
[1:12:00.160 --> 1:12:04.160]  That's just some of the situation we're facing.
[1:12:04.160 --> 1:12:10.160]  In fact, let's play it with audio in Spanish of the aid trucks being burned up, being blown up,
[1:12:10.160 --> 1:12:14.160]  and people being shot up and killed as well just a few days ago.
[1:12:14.160 --> 1:12:20.160]  And again, I held judgment until Maduro came out Sunday and said, yes, we did it, we'll do it again.
[1:12:20.160 --> 1:12:25.160]  We're not beggars. No, you just starve the people and then make them come to you.
[1:12:25.160 --> 1:12:31.160]  Venezuela has volcanic soil, all the timber, all the minerals, the oil.
[1:12:31.160 --> 1:12:36.160]  It's one of the richest countries in the world for resources.
[1:12:36.160 --> 1:12:39.160]  That's why its people were so wealthy.
[1:12:39.160 --> 1:12:42.160]  But that's all in the past now, isn't it?
[1:12:42.160 --> 1:12:46.160]  And don't worry, Maduro and all these guys in Chavez sold out to big multinationals.
[1:12:46.160 --> 1:12:49.160]  Big companies came in and extracted it all.
[1:12:49.160 --> 1:12:52.160]  They got rid of the local rich people and they brought in the multinationals.
[1:12:52.160 --> 1:12:59.160]  And they've all got their Swiss chateaus and their Luxembourg castles.
[1:12:59.160 --> 1:13:03.160]  And if Maduro makes it out of there alive, Rubio's saying he won't.
[1:13:03.160 --> 1:13:06.160]  You know, he'll run off to Switzerland.
[1:13:06.160 --> 1:13:09.160]  Just like all these other Latin American presidents who always find out,
[1:13:09.160 --> 1:13:14.160]  you know, get hundreds of millions of dollars in bribes.
[1:13:14.160 --> 1:13:17.160]  So here's some of that carnage.
[1:13:17.160 --> 1:13:24.160]  And then Maduro took credit for it.
[1:13:24.160 --> 1:13:33.160]  And then Maduro took credit for it.
[1:13:33.160 --> 1:13:46.160]  And then Maduro took credit for it.
[1:13:46.160 --> 1:13:49.160]  Maduro took credit for this.
[1:13:49.160 --> 1:13:52.160]  I don't just believe seeing it.
[1:13:52.160 --> 1:13:58.160]  I went to the Venezuelan newspapers and he took credit.
[1:13:58.160 --> 1:14:01.160]  You've got trucks with red crosses on them.
[1:14:01.160 --> 1:14:05.160]  Let's burn these up.
[1:14:05.160 --> 1:14:10.160]  You've got the truck drivers trying to get the tractors unhooked from the trailers
[1:14:10.160 --> 1:14:13.160]  before they burn up.
[1:14:13.160 --> 1:14:18.160]  And then the scenes, there's more scenes of the military shooting people.
[1:14:18.160 --> 1:14:20.160]  So yeah, this is like Celsius Romania.
[1:14:20.160 --> 1:14:28.160]  It's like Russia before its Revolution 91 under Gorbachev was a globalist puppet.
[1:14:28.160 --> 1:14:32.160]  It's like in these countries, the people deserve freedom.
[1:14:32.160 --> 1:14:34.160]  But I want to know listeners' views.
[1:14:34.160 --> 1:14:36.160]  I want to get your view on all of this.
[1:14:36.160 --> 1:14:42.160]  Yeah, show them the footage of the Venezuelan troops kicking the truck drivers out.
[1:14:42.160 --> 1:14:46.160]  And then burning them down.
[1:14:46.160 --> 1:14:54.160]  And think of the courage it would take out of Colombia to drive in to Venezuela
[1:14:54.160 --> 1:15:01.160]  knowing that the military is waiting to burn up your vehicle or shoot you.
[1:15:01.160 --> 1:15:02.160]  And you got to hand it to Venezuela.
[1:15:02.160 --> 1:15:03.160]  They didn't even steal the food.
[1:15:03.160 --> 1:15:05.160]  They just blew it up and burned it.
[1:15:05.160 --> 1:15:07.160]  There's hours of this footage.
[1:15:07.160 --> 1:15:09.160]  I want to get your take on it all.
[1:15:09.160 --> 1:15:10.160]  What do we do about Venezuela?
[1:15:10.160 --> 1:15:16.160]  I mean, it's immoral if we don't do something because it's causing the collapse of Latin America into the U.S.
[1:15:16.160 --> 1:15:21.160]  Long before globalism, we sent troops into Mexico repeatedly when it was collapsing into us.
[1:15:21.160 --> 1:15:25.160]  I don't want this to happen, but I mean, we're in an emergency here.
[1:15:25.160 --> 1:15:29.160]  But do you feel good with John Bolton and the Neocons like flying monkeys flying around up there?
[1:15:29.160 --> 1:15:30.160]  I don't feel good about it.
[1:15:30.160 --> 1:15:31.160]  I've got a bad feeling.
[1:15:31.160 --> 1:15:35.160]  800-25-99-231, because they're evil.
[1:15:35.160 --> 1:15:39.160]  And they always have to take one thing and make it worse, like the Middle East.
[1:15:39.160 --> 1:15:44.160]  800-25-99-231, 800.
[1:15:44.160 --> 1:15:45.160]  But only if they never come back.
[1:15:45.160 --> 1:15:46.160]  I'm so out of this.
[1:15:46.160 --> 1:15:47.160]  That's the old DC number.
[1:15:47.160 --> 1:15:49.160]  It's 877-789-Alex.
[1:15:49.160 --> 1:15:51.160]  877-789-Alex.
[1:15:51.160 --> 1:16:17.160]  That's the right number.
[1:16:17.160 --> 1:16:22.160]  Together we'll recapture America.
[1:16:22.160 --> 1:16:49.160]  877-789-Alex.
[1:16:49.160 --> 1:16:56.160]  877-789-Alex.
[1:17:19.160 --> 1:17:24.160]  It's the Babylonian system, and you have to escape it before it's too late.
[1:17:24.160 --> 1:17:27.160]  Haven't you ever wanted to wake up from this nightmare?

[1:20:27.160 --> 1:20:33.160]  The United States is on the verge of war with the Communist dictatorship of Venezuela.
[1:20:33.160 --> 1:20:35.160]  It's already a failed state.
[1:20:35.160 --> 1:20:39.160]  Over a thousand a week, according to Amos International, starved to death.
[1:20:39.160 --> 1:20:44.160]  Three years ago, Venezuelan dictator made it illegal to report on the starvation.
[1:20:44.160 --> 1:20:50.160]  They use starvation and lack of medicine as a tool of control and loyalty to the party.
[1:20:50.160 --> 1:20:54.160]  Now the poorest areas that were under their control have been rebelling.
[1:20:54.160 --> 1:20:59.160]  They have been torturing and shooting and killing the indigenous peoples.
[1:20:59.160 --> 1:21:02.160]  I want Maduro to be removed.
[1:21:02.160 --> 1:21:05.160]  I know they staged these elections.
[1:21:05.160 --> 1:21:13.160]  Well, there's Vice President Mike Pence just hours ago meeting with the man that many polls showed was the real winner of the last election,
[1:21:13.160 --> 1:21:18.160]  who's had to flee the country because there's a death warrant out for him by the dictator Maduro.
[1:21:18.160 --> 1:21:20.160]  So I want Maduro out.
[1:21:20.160 --> 1:21:22.160]  I hate communism.
[1:21:22.160 --> 1:21:26.160]  I can't stand people like Sean Penn coming out how great Venezuela is.
[1:21:26.160 --> 1:21:29.160]  Then go live down there, you horrible little bastard.
[1:21:29.160 --> 1:21:31.160]  You little spoiled rotten rat.
[1:21:31.160 --> 1:21:34.160]  You and AOC and the rest of you.
[1:21:34.160 --> 1:21:36.160]  Michael Moore, go to Venezuela.
[1:21:36.160 --> 1:21:37.160]  They'll probably eat you.
[1:21:37.160 --> 1:21:39.160]  You feed a family for a month.
[1:21:39.160 --> 1:21:41.160]  Land whale.
[1:21:41.160 --> 1:21:43.160]  I'm not fat shaming.
[1:21:43.160 --> 1:21:45.160]  I'm saying they're starving to death.
[1:21:45.160 --> 1:21:54.160]  I saw a UN number, which are pretty accurate on the ground, that the average Venezuelan last year lost 26 pounds.
[1:21:54.160 --> 1:21:55.160]  It's 23 or 26.
[1:21:55.160 --> 1:21:56.160]  Pull that up.
[1:21:56.160 --> 1:22:00.160]  How much weight the average Venezuelan lost in 2018?
[1:22:00.160 --> 1:22:03.160]  And man, you look at the videos of the protest.
[1:22:03.160 --> 1:22:07.160]  I mean, these are some skinny people now.
[1:22:07.160 --> 1:22:09.160]  You look at who's arriving here.
[1:22:09.160 --> 1:22:18.160]  And a lot of these caravans, they look like they didn't ever miss an all you could eat buffet three times a day.
[1:22:18.160 --> 1:22:19.160]  I went from memory.
[1:22:19.160 --> 1:22:20.160]  I said 26 or 23.
[1:22:20.160 --> 1:22:23.160]  It's 24 pounds.
[1:22:23.160 --> 1:22:29.160]  24 pounds Reuters reports from poverty studies.
[1:22:29.160 --> 1:22:31.160]  That's what communism is.
[1:22:31.160 --> 1:22:33.160]  That's what it always ends up doing.
[1:22:33.160 --> 1:22:35.160]  Always.
[1:22:35.160 --> 1:22:43.160]  But John Bolton's a neocon who helped engineer all the failures in Iraq and the Arab Spring of the Democrats.
[1:22:43.160 --> 1:22:49.160]  John Bolton's is bad with some of the policies he's pushed as people like Maduro.
[1:22:49.160 --> 1:22:52.160]  And John Bolton's not even one of the worst the neocons.
[1:22:52.160 --> 1:23:04.160]  You get into David from and you get into Max boot and you get into crystal and you get into all of these other creeperzoids.
[1:23:04.160 --> 1:23:11.160]  They're the ones involved with the Democrats running the Internet censorship and news guard and all the police state crap.
[1:23:11.160 --> 1:23:15.160]  They're the more competent group in the government of carrying out tyranny.
[1:23:15.160 --> 1:23:18.160]  They're the problem.
[1:23:18.160 --> 1:23:23.160]  And so I care about the president.
[1:23:23.160 --> 1:23:26.160]  I like Pence and I think they're a governing force over the neocons.
[1:23:26.160 --> 1:23:36.160]  Because that's who's in charge in government so they might as well co-opt the neocons, but I don't want the neocons co-opting Trump.
[1:23:36.160 --> 1:23:42.160]  And so I like what Trump said an aid package, an emergency system to go in.
[1:23:42.160 --> 1:23:48.160]  If they accept it, which Maduro has been given ultimatum, let an international peace group in.
[1:23:48.160 --> 1:23:58.160]  I don't like the UN, but it's better than a war and come in, stabilize and have a new election.
[1:23:58.160 --> 1:24:00.160]  But Maduro's not going to do that.
[1:24:00.160 --> 1:24:05.160]  And the Russian troops are pouring in.
[1:24:05.160 --> 1:24:07.160]  The Cuban troops are already there.
[1:24:07.160 --> 1:24:09.160]  The Chinese weapons are coming in.
[1:24:09.160 --> 1:24:14.160]  The Iranian gun boats are arriving and now they're in our hemisphere in our backyard.
[1:24:14.160 --> 1:24:18.160]  I know Trump, I know the Pentagon.
[1:24:18.160 --> 1:24:27.160]  I think within a week you're going to have C-130s going around with their howitzers hanging out the windows and their many guns vaporizing Maduro's people.
[1:24:27.160 --> 1:24:35.160]  And if the Russians follow their previous activity, if it's not in their hemisphere, they will probably withdraw and only be advisors.
[1:24:35.160 --> 1:24:37.160]  But a bunch of Russians are about to get killed.
[1:24:37.160 --> 1:24:39.160]  You can bet that.
[1:24:39.160 --> 1:24:43.160]  You can bet the satellites have already picked all the targets.
[1:24:43.160 --> 1:24:49.160]  But I would expect this will not go as well as removing Manuel Noriega.
[1:24:49.160 --> 1:24:56.160]  And that was done purely because he was threatening to expose CIA drug trafficking if they cut his money out.
[1:24:56.160 --> 1:25:01.160]  And they sent some women at a U.S. university, got kidnapped.
[1:25:01.160 --> 1:25:02.160]  None of it was true.
[1:25:02.160 --> 1:25:04.160]  Panama deception, it tells it all.
[1:25:04.160 --> 1:25:06.160]  I was not for the Panama War.
[1:25:06.160 --> 1:25:08.160]  This though will be different.
[1:25:08.160 --> 1:25:09.160]  There will be casualties.
[1:25:09.160 --> 1:25:12.160]  There will be U.S. troops killed.
[1:25:12.160 --> 1:25:14.160]  This will be a bloodbath.
[1:25:14.160 --> 1:25:24.160]  And it looks like the deal has been made, at least on the surface between Pence and the opposition leader who's living in exile in Columbia.
[1:25:24.160 --> 1:25:26.160]  So we'll see how all this unfolds.
[1:25:26.160 --> 1:25:29.160]  I want to get your take on it.
[1:25:29.160 --> 1:25:33.160]  When we come back on the other side, Putin has issued a warning.
[1:25:33.160 --> 1:25:36.160]  Russia TV lists nuclear targets in the U.S.
[1:25:36.160 --> 1:25:38.160]  That's after his warning on this.
[1:25:38.160 --> 1:25:42.160]  So things are deteriorating very, very, very, very quickly.
[1:25:42.160 --> 1:25:45.160]  In fact, I saw that this morning in front to cover it.
[1:25:45.160 --> 1:25:46.160]  Please print me that.
[1:25:46.160 --> 1:25:48.160]  That should be our top story at FullWars.com.
[1:25:48.160 --> 1:25:52.160]  After Putin warning, Russia TV lists nuclear targets in the U.S.
[1:25:52.160 --> 1:26:00.160]  So Russia is now broadcasting targets for nuclear war inside the U.S.
[1:26:00.160 --> 1:26:04.160]  See, we're not really just at war with Venezuela.
[1:26:04.160 --> 1:26:07.160]  Wow, that's a whole other subject right there.
[1:26:07.160 --> 1:26:08.160]  Really, Toledo.
[1:26:08.160 --> 1:26:10.160]  It's just, it's all unraveling.
[1:26:10.160 --> 1:26:16.160]  It's out of control and Trump's trying to get peace over in Vietnam while all this is unfolding.
[1:26:16.160 --> 1:26:27.160]  Then imagine the mindset of people that are starving to death and willing to stand up as soldiers with guns.
[1:26:27.160 --> 1:26:29.160]  This is just unraveling very, very quickly.
[1:26:29.160 --> 1:26:31.160]  We'll talk about when we come back.
[1:26:31.160 --> 1:26:33.160]  877-789-2539.
[1:26:33.160 --> 1:26:42.160]  And then we have joining us in studio Robert Barnes, who is the lead lawyer here in our operations now.
[1:26:42.160 --> 1:26:48.160]  Really tightening a bead on the globalist for a strategy of victory.
[1:26:48.160 --> 1:26:54.160]  And he's going to be talking to a man that he repeatedly got found not guilty.
[1:26:54.160 --> 1:26:57.160]  Joe Bannister, former Treasury agent.
[1:26:57.160 --> 1:27:00.160]  They tried to put him in prison for exposing the IRS's crimes.
[1:27:00.160 --> 1:27:06.160]  Well, liberal juries repeatedly found him not guilty thanks to Robert Barnes and the truth.
[1:27:06.160 --> 1:27:08.160]  They'll both be with us today.
[1:27:08.160 --> 1:27:13.160]  Joe via Skype, Robert Barnes in studio, then Owen Benjamin will also be joining us.
[1:27:13.160 --> 1:27:23.160]  Now, please don't forget that we're an information war and the globalists are trying as hard as they can to keep you from communicating
[1:27:23.160 --> 1:27:28.160]  and to keep you from speaking out and to keep you from involving yourself in the community.
[1:27:28.160 --> 1:27:31.160]  And there's a continuum here, kind of like choose your own adventure.
[1:27:31.160 --> 1:27:36.160]  If you want to wear a red Make America Great Again hat, you might get your lunch bought for you in red areas,
[1:27:36.160 --> 1:27:41.160]  but you might get stabbed or hit over the head with a 2x4 in blue areas.
[1:27:41.160 --> 1:27:49.160]  But if you wear a Molan lobby shirt, or a Don't California My Texas shirt, or Don't Venezuela My USA shirt,
[1:27:49.160 --> 1:27:55.160]  we've got that shirt coming in, or you get a woman's Molan lobby, you're just going to meet other patriots
[1:27:55.160 --> 1:28:01.160]  and still spread the word about basic maxims of freedom.
[1:28:01.160 --> 1:28:08.160]  Get a t-shirt today. We've got a wide spectrum of shirts, some of the best shirts we've ever had.
[1:28:08.160 --> 1:28:15.160]  An infowarstore.com, and that's one of our biggest outreaches too, are these infowars.com shirts.
[1:28:15.160 --> 1:28:22.160]  We're also going to come out with a newswars.com shirt, where again, if you don't want to get in a blue area and get stabbed or shot,
[1:28:22.160 --> 1:28:27.160]  just wear a newswars.com, the average libtard doesn't know what that is, but you still spread the word about the website
[1:28:27.160 --> 1:28:29.160]  and you still meet light-minded people.
[1:28:29.160 --> 1:28:33.160]  And we've got some other great shirts, we've got the Tiananmen Square shirt, it's one of my favorites,
[1:28:33.160 --> 1:28:37.160]  that shows the tanks of big tech rolling up against free speech.
[1:28:37.160 --> 1:28:41.160]  We've got the George Washington shirt, we've got so many great shirts,
[1:28:41.160 --> 1:28:47.160]  ball caps, infowarstore.com, infowarslive.com, or triple A-253-313.

[1:33:17.160 --> 1:33:22.160]  The current lives of the information war is Alex Jones.
[1:33:47.160 --> 1:34:02.160]  I'm Alex Jones, your host. Thank you for joining us. We're at the Midway Point, the broadcast today.
[1:34:02.160 --> 1:34:13.160]  I want to illustrate, before you go to your phone calls, just how insane all the globalists divide and conquer race-baiting is.
[1:34:13.160 --> 1:34:20.160]  It's all of our children being hit by genetically modified crops and food that on record are causing mutations and cancer.
[1:34:20.160 --> 1:34:24.160]  It's all of our children that are being bombarded by the Hollywood evil.
[1:34:24.160 --> 1:34:30.160]  It's all of our children being targeted for abortion and then sexualization if they make it out of the womb.
[1:34:30.160 --> 1:34:36.160]  It's all of our children being targeted by tainted, poisoned vaccines on record.
[1:34:36.160 --> 1:34:43.160]  It's all of our children that are threatened by nuclear holocaust that I do agree with the International Federation of Scientists
[1:34:43.160 --> 1:34:54.160]  that we're closer to the doomsday destruction on the doomsday clock than we've ever been since the Cuban Missile Crisis in 1961.
[1:34:54.160 --> 1:35:04.160]  This is out of Reuters. After Putin's warning, Russian TV lists nuclear targets in the U.S.
[1:35:04.160 --> 1:35:18.160]  So while our government's been funding the Arab Spring and Trump tried to stop that, Maduro's running around, blowing up and burning down food trucks.
[1:35:18.160 --> 1:35:23.160]  Russian state television has listed U.S. military facilities that Moscow would target in the event of a nuclear strike
[1:35:23.160 --> 1:35:33.160]  and said that hypersonic missile Russia's developing would be able to hit them in less than five minutes.
[1:35:33.160 --> 1:35:41.160]  And the media has always, Russia's got faster missiles than us, and that's when the Pentagon gets more funding. Yeah, right.
[1:35:41.160 --> 1:35:48.160]  But let's just put it to you this way. Nobody wins in this. We'll all destroy the planet.
[1:35:48.160 --> 1:35:57.160]  The U.S. has the most advanced weapons, but we should not have given even the 1970s technology we've got to the Chycoms.
[1:35:57.160 --> 1:36:08.160]  That's really stupid. And the Russians have got their own technology that is extremely deadly, and we're not going to be able to stop hardly any of it.
[1:36:08.160 --> 1:36:19.160]  Not the sea-launched cruise missiles, especially. You know, half our population lives on the eastern seaboard and the western seaboard, more than half.
[1:36:19.160 --> 1:36:37.160]  There are submarines 12 miles off the shore. Nothing's going to stop the cruise missiles. All those cities, Seattle, Portland, San Francisco, Los Angeles, San Diego, particularly, will be vaporized.
[1:36:37.160 --> 1:36:40.160]  Vaporized.
[1:36:40.160 --> 1:36:48.160]  Why don't you pull up Terminator Judgment Day that shows Los Angeles being new? That that's pretty accurate. See if you can find that on YouTube.
[1:36:48.160 --> 1:36:56.160]  Terminator 2 Judgment Day, nuke scene for TV viewers.
[1:36:56.160 --> 1:37:04.160]  And Hillary wanted all these wars, and Trump's been trying to get us out of it.
[1:37:04.160 --> 1:37:12.160]  But crisis with Russia is escalating because Trump has allowed the neocons to push troops onto the borders with Russia.
[1:37:12.160 --> 1:37:15.160]  And so Russia's like, well, we'll put troops in your backyard.
[1:37:15.160 --> 1:37:20.160]  Troops in Cuba? Cuba missile crisis.
[1:37:20.160 --> 1:37:26.160]  Troops in Venezuela? The Venezuela missile crisis.
[1:37:26.160 --> 1:37:42.160]  See, they don't need to put tube launched missile launchers in Cuba now, ladies and gentlemen. They've got sea launched cruise missiles and the equivalent of Trident intermediate range missiles.
[1:37:42.160 --> 1:37:49.160]  But the thing about a cruise missile is it flies below the radar.
[1:37:49.160 --> 1:37:53.160]  And you're not going to stop it.
[1:37:53.160 --> 1:37:57.160]  Especially if you fire, say, five of them off a sub at LA.
[1:37:57.160 --> 1:38:01.160]  One about a minute out from the last.
[1:38:01.160 --> 1:38:08.160]  And sure, they start shooting missiles, they start shooting, you know, high powered projectile weapons at it.
[1:38:08.160 --> 1:38:13.160]  All they do is detonate one to scramble all the electronics so the other cruise missiles come in right behind it.
[1:38:13.160 --> 1:38:15.160]  And that's the doctrine.
[1:38:15.160 --> 1:38:19.160]  By the way, have you ever sit at the beach and you see a nuke go off a couple miles out?
[1:38:19.160 --> 1:38:25.160]  And more nukes are coming right behind that one. That's a tactic you use is you detonate nukes ahead as you come in.
[1:38:25.160 --> 1:38:30.160]  Nothing's going to stop that. Scramble is everything.
[1:38:30.160 --> 1:38:35.160]  So if you're ever like, oh, look, looks like a missile. You see that missile shot out of the air like, oh, we stopped it.
[1:38:35.160 --> 1:38:48.160]  Four or five more coming that same direction.
[1:38:48.160 --> 1:38:52.160]  So AOC says that we don't pay Al Gore and Lord Rothschild everything.
[1:38:52.160 --> 1:38:55.160]  You know, we do carbon taxes. We're all going to hell.
[1:38:55.160 --> 1:39:01.160]  But you know what? We could see the end of the world if this ranksmanship with Russia just continues when Russia is not even our enemy.
[1:39:01.160 --> 1:39:07.160]  The chai comms are the ones encircling us. The chai comms are the ones pushing us all around.
[1:39:07.160 --> 1:39:17.160]  But because we're pushing Russia even stronger than China now, Russia is going into a militaristic posture.
[1:39:17.160 --> 1:39:26.160]  Because Russia has been invaded and attacked many times and knows that lying down only encourages an aggressor.
[1:39:26.160 --> 1:39:29.160]  So, you know, Trump thinks he's going to make his deal in the peninsula. That's great.
[1:39:29.160 --> 1:39:32.160]  How about we make the deal with Russia? You see, the neocons were smart.
[1:39:32.160 --> 1:39:34.160]  They're the ones that were running the Democrats.
[1:39:34.160 --> 1:39:45.160]  They always called Trump a Russian agent, knowing that if he ever made a deal with Russia, that would end their world government system.
[1:39:45.160 --> 1:39:56.160]  And so that's why they strategically positioned themselves that way in the media to always say if Trump even meets with Putin, he's a bad guy.
[1:39:56.160 --> 1:40:02.160]  And they're just maneuvering us towards destruction. They're crazy.
[1:40:02.160 --> 1:40:09.160]  Now, let's go ahead and play a clip of Spike Lee because, you know, nuclear war with Russia, it doesn't matter.
[1:40:09.160 --> 1:40:14.160]  You know, everything's just America and the left trying to stir black people up against white people.
[1:40:14.160 --> 1:40:22.160]  And the reason the left panicking is, numbers show more than double the number of blacks support Republicans now because they're figuring out the scam.
[1:40:22.160 --> 1:40:29.160]  So, Spike Lee, who can't even seem to read off his piece of paper, dressed up as a stupid pimp outfit.
[1:40:29.160 --> 1:40:38.160]  I mean, what a joke. I mean, what a joke worth hundreds of millions of dollars, a tool of Hollywood to create racial division.
[1:40:38.160 --> 1:40:46.160]  And he's up there talking about how, where is KKK moving? And we got to get Trump out of office here at us.
[1:40:57.160 --> 1:41:03.160]  Sometimes our computers have a little bit of a hiccup. Let's just stop it right there. It's okay. Let's stop it. Stop it.
[1:41:03.160 --> 1:41:11.160]  No, no, stop it. We're going to start it over at the beginning. Computers have hiccups. It's not a big deal.
[1:41:11.160 --> 1:41:17.160]  But once they start train wrecking, we're going to stop it. It's just going to happen the way it is.
[1:41:17.160 --> 1:41:20.160]  Let's go ahead and start it over now here, Spike Lee.
[1:41:20.160 --> 1:41:24.160]  All right.
[1:41:29.160 --> 1:41:36.160]  We're not playing it. I'm done. Terminate. Terminate. Terminate. Terminate. Terminate. Terminate. Terminate. I'm not mad.
[1:41:36.160 --> 1:41:40.160]  It's a corrupted clip. Now understand, we're not playing that clip.
[1:41:40.160 --> 1:41:45.160]  I understand. Oh, they dumped it live because he was cussing too. Well, I didn't know that.
[1:41:45.160 --> 1:41:50.160]  I saw the clip at home and it wasn't like that. So it's not a big deal, guys. The audience doesn't care
[1:41:50.160 --> 1:41:55.160]  that the clip's having a problem or that I don't understand. It's not a big deal.
[1:41:55.160 --> 1:42:00.160]  Everything's great. You have to understand they're talking to me in the air, folks. I'm not just talking to the wall here.
[1:42:00.160 --> 1:42:06.160]  They're talking to me in my air and they're not just talking to the wall here. Everything's good. We're done talking about Spike Lee.
[1:42:06.160 --> 1:42:12.160]  Everybody knows what Spike Lee said. Everybody knows what Spike Lee did. We'll fix this in post when we re-upload it
[1:42:12.160 --> 1:42:19.160]  when we're not live and we'll get to it later. My point in getting to that, though, was if you want to see some real racist
[1:42:19.160 --> 1:42:25.160]  and you want to see some really bad stuff, it's the black Israelites that were attacking the Covington kids.
[1:42:25.160 --> 1:42:30.160]  Our reporter talked to them and they say, yeah, you're a white person. You deserve to die and God's going to kill you.
[1:42:30.160 --> 1:42:37.160]  None of that's in the Bible. It's totally insane. But that's what every twisted cult group believes is that they are the master race,
[1:42:37.160 --> 1:42:42.160]  whether it's the black Israelites or the Nazis or, you know, there's extremist groups all over the place.
[1:42:42.160 --> 1:42:49.160]  But in this climate, more and more minorities are acting like this because they've been taught it's impossible for them to be racist.
[1:42:49.160 --> 1:43:07.160]  Your phone calls, I promise, are straight ahead when we come back. I'm Alex Jones.
[1:43:20.160 --> 1:43:34.160]  We have developed, hands down, from our research, the most powerful, healthy energy drink pre-workout and beyond system in the world.
[1:43:34.160 --> 1:43:39.160]  There's nothing else like it. You must experience it. It is a total game changer.
[1:43:39.160 --> 1:43:44.160]  It comes in easy to use, packaged, mixed in with fruit juice or water, whatever you'd like.
[1:43:44.160 --> 1:43:49.160]  Warning, though, it's very, very strong. It lasts up to 10 hours. So take a half pack at the first time you take it
[1:43:49.160 --> 1:43:54.160]  because TurboForce is named TurboForce because it will take you into overdrive.
[1:43:54.160 --> 1:43:57.160]  TurboForce and enforcelife.com.
[1:43:57.160 --> 1:44:05.160]  I've been doing a lot of research into Google and YouTube censorship and I've noticed that there's one type of video
[1:44:05.160 --> 1:44:15.160]  that is the most censored, the most buried, the most suppressed. And that's the videos where you saw in 2016 election night
[1:44:15.160 --> 1:44:22.160]  all the arrogant, leftist authoritarians like the young turds and others get so butt hurt when Trump won.
[1:44:22.160 --> 1:44:28.160]  They don't want us to have that victory. They don't want us to remember what political action did.
[1:44:28.160 --> 1:44:36.160]  And that's why the globalist, Hillary and others, are trying to shut InfoWars down. This is a fight about taking your speech away,

[1:47:20.160 --> 1:47:28.160]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones.
[1:47:34.160 --> 1:47:37.160]  Alright, I'm gonna go bam, bam, bam, bam through your calls.
[1:47:37.160 --> 1:47:42.160]  Okay, and we'll go right into the next hour as well with special guests joining us in studio and out.
[1:47:42.160 --> 1:47:46.160]  Robert Barnes will be in studio and of course Joe Bannister, they both know each other.
[1:47:46.160 --> 1:47:50.160]  Let's go ahead and go to your phone calls right now.
[1:47:50.160 --> 1:47:54.160]  Let's go ahead and take another call here.
[1:47:54.160 --> 1:47:57.160]  Let's talk to Pastor Sam in Texas.
[1:47:57.160 --> 1:48:02.160]  Pastor Sam, what do you think we should do about Venezuela?
[1:48:02.160 --> 1:48:06.160]  Oh my goodness, it's cracking open.
[1:48:06.160 --> 1:48:13.160]  First, I'd like to say that all of your analysis that you just shot from the hip on is 100% correct.
[1:48:13.160 --> 1:48:17.160]  I have a lot more information to support those points.
[1:48:17.160 --> 1:48:21.160]  One thing for example, we don't need the UN at all.
[1:48:21.160 --> 1:48:29.160]  The Organization of American States is already set up to go in with our Latin American allies to include Canada
[1:48:29.160 --> 1:48:35.160]  to go in and manage the reconstruction or the transition, the establishment of free elections.
[1:48:35.160 --> 1:48:38.160]  So the UN can just be cut out completely.
[1:48:38.160 --> 1:48:43.160]  That's part of the reason that the globalists are so angry about this.
[1:48:43.160 --> 1:48:46.160]  They're still trying to make their inroads.
[1:48:46.160 --> 1:48:51.160]  They're still trying to go in first with vaccinations and first with a coalition of churches.
[1:48:51.160 --> 1:48:53.160]  I'm really not for that.
[1:48:53.160 --> 1:48:59.160]  That was what was wrong with Joplin, Missouri, if anybody wonders why the hand of God came in and destroyed that
[1:48:59.160 --> 1:49:04.160]  because all the churches were united and the Roman ones were running it.
[1:49:04.160 --> 1:49:07.160]  You're absolutely correct in all of your points.
[1:49:07.160 --> 1:49:11.160]  Everything that you laid out, including your mistrust of Marco Rubio.
[1:49:11.160 --> 1:49:13.160]  I don't like Marco Rubio.
[1:49:13.160 --> 1:49:18.160]  I don't like his de facto position as the answer man for Latin America.
[1:49:18.160 --> 1:49:21.160]  It's just a good thing that we fought hard for Cruz.
[1:49:21.160 --> 1:49:27.160]  Because otherwise, Marco Rubio and Beto O'Rourke would be down tiptoeing through the tulips together
[1:49:27.160 --> 1:49:33.160]  and making sure that whatever happens in there is a globalist government.
[1:49:33.160 --> 1:49:38.160]  Sure, I don't want the UN in Venezuela, but if the UN, if Trump gets involved with the UN,
[1:49:38.160 --> 1:49:42.160]  then that'll make Russia and China stand down because it'll be done down at the UN.
[1:49:42.160 --> 1:49:44.160]  I don't like the UN. I can't stand the UN.
[1:49:44.160 --> 1:49:47.160]  And you're right, the Organization of American States would be a great way to do it.
[1:49:47.160 --> 1:49:50.160]  All I know is it's already a failed state.
[1:49:50.160 --> 1:49:52.160]  Venezuela is already a failed state.
[1:49:52.160 --> 1:49:55.160]  It's collapsing into Central America now.
[1:49:55.160 --> 1:49:57.160]  It's destabilizing the whole area.
[1:49:57.160 --> 1:49:59.160]  Actually, I don't know how the US doesn't act.
[1:49:59.160 --> 1:50:04.160]  It is in our sphere of influence and I don't know how Maduro would torch all those trucks
[1:50:04.160 --> 1:50:05.160]  and then take credit.
[1:50:05.160 --> 1:50:09.160]  I thought that's got to be a false flag by Colombia because it makes Maduro look so bad.
[1:50:09.160 --> 1:50:12.160]  No, Maduro is so disconnected from reality.
[1:50:12.160 --> 1:50:16.160]  He doesn't know how crazy he looks in those military training videos
[1:50:16.160 --> 1:50:18.160]  where the military is looking at him like he's a moron.
[1:50:18.160 --> 1:50:23.160]  I mean, Maduro literally, I think, is like a 70 IQ.
[1:50:23.160 --> 1:50:29.160]  Guaidó made the checkmate move to move the, when he put all the aid on the borders,
[1:50:29.160 --> 1:50:30.160]  that was the checkmate move.
[1:50:30.160 --> 1:50:32.160]  By the way, he is elected.
[1:50:32.160 --> 1:50:33.160]  He was elected to Congress.
[1:50:33.160 --> 1:50:37.160]  The Congress chose him to be basically the speaker of the House.
[1:50:37.160 --> 1:50:43.160]  And then there was a constitutional provision for him to take power in the event of an absence or a fraud.
[1:50:43.160 --> 1:50:44.160]  No, no, no.
[1:50:44.160 --> 1:50:48.160]  I know he got in after being the minion of Chavez,
[1:50:48.160 --> 1:50:50.160]  but since then the elections have been fraudulent.
[1:50:50.160 --> 1:50:53.160]  They've gone in, they've changed the rules in the legislature.
[1:50:53.160 --> 1:50:54.160]  I appreciate your call.
[1:50:54.160 --> 1:50:57.160]  Most evidence points towards him being a dictator.
[1:50:57.160 --> 1:50:59.160]  Hell, he's machine gunning people in the streets now.
[1:50:59.160 --> 1:51:01.160]  All I know is the place is collapsing.
[1:51:01.160 --> 1:51:02.160]  Who's up next?
[1:51:02.160 --> 1:51:03.160]  Let's talk to Alex in Michigan.
[1:51:03.160 --> 1:51:04.160]  Alex, thanks for calling.
[1:51:04.160 --> 1:51:05.160]  Go ahead.
[1:51:05.160 --> 1:51:09.160]  Alex Jones, good to talk to you again.
[1:51:09.160 --> 1:51:10.160]  Good talk to you, Alex.
[1:51:10.160 --> 1:51:13.160]  I just wanted to plug the fish oil.
[1:51:13.160 --> 1:51:15.160]  The fish oil has iodine in it.
[1:51:15.160 --> 1:51:17.160]  I don't know if you knew that.
[1:51:17.160 --> 1:51:20.160]  I know that we go out to the top firms in the country and say,
[1:51:20.160 --> 1:51:22.160]  what is the highest rated, cleanest, best fish oil?
[1:51:22.160 --> 1:51:24.160]  And then we product label it and sell it for less.
[1:51:24.160 --> 1:51:29.160]  So a lot of our products, half our products are more, are product labeled, top brands.
[1:51:29.160 --> 1:51:35.160]  That way we already get the top testing, already, you know, loved by a bunch of people.
[1:51:35.160 --> 1:51:38.160]  And so yes, all three of our fish oils are top of the line.
[1:51:38.160 --> 1:51:40.160]  Yeah, they're great products.
[1:51:40.160 --> 1:51:41.160]  InfowarsStore.com.
[1:51:41.160 --> 1:51:43.160]  Thank you, brother.
[1:51:43.160 --> 1:51:48.160]  You know, Venezuela, it's kind of a pickle here because, you know, I don't trust Bolton
[1:51:48.160 --> 1:51:51.160]  or the deep state false flaggers.
[1:51:51.160 --> 1:51:55.160]  They have, it's like the boy who cried wolf, like how can you trust these guys?
[1:51:55.160 --> 1:52:00.160]  But at the same time, Venezuela is a hellhole.
[1:52:00.160 --> 1:52:03.160]  And I think we should invade Mexico too.
[1:52:03.160 --> 1:52:05.160]  Mexico is a failed state.
[1:52:05.160 --> 1:52:10.160]  We should, you know, if we didn't have all these deep state traders running things,
[1:52:10.160 --> 1:52:16.160]  we could really liberate these people, but it's kind of, it's kind of a shame, you know,
[1:52:16.160 --> 1:52:21.160]  like you can't trust these people to actually do the job.
[1:52:21.160 --> 1:52:23.160]  That's where I'm coming from.
[1:52:23.160 --> 1:52:25.160]  Like we can't even pull out of Syria.
[1:52:25.160 --> 1:52:27.160]  I mean, exactly.
[1:52:27.160 --> 1:52:31.160]  And if we cherry picked people out of Latin America or anywhere else, they'd be great for our country.
[1:52:31.160 --> 1:52:33.160]  Instead, the UN sets up these refugee bases.
[1:52:33.160 --> 1:52:40.160]  They indoctrinate, you know, the most poor, unskilled people to come here expecting a free lunch and to be socialist.
[1:52:40.160 --> 1:52:42.160]  That's a recipe for disaster.
[1:52:42.160 --> 1:52:44.160]  It's a total recipe for disaster.
[1:52:44.160 --> 1:52:45.160]  God bless you.
[1:52:45.160 --> 1:52:46.160]  Appreciate the call.
[1:52:46.160 --> 1:52:49.160]  We're going to Carlos and Josh and a bunch of others here.
[1:52:49.160 --> 1:52:50.160]  Let's go ahead.
[1:52:50.160 --> 1:52:52.160]  Don't take a call on North Korea.
[1:52:52.160 --> 1:52:54.160]  Talk to Peter in Chicago.
[1:52:54.160 --> 1:53:00.160]  He wants to compare North Korea to Venezuela.
[1:53:00.160 --> 1:53:04.160]  You know, guys, Jones, it's an honor to be able to speak on your show.
[1:53:04.160 --> 1:53:05.160]  Honored to talk to you, sir.
[1:53:05.160 --> 1:53:06.160]  Thank you.
[1:53:06.160 --> 1:53:11.160]  I would first like to say that I've lived in both South Korea and in Northern China.
[1:53:11.160 --> 1:53:15.160]  And that is where I'm facing my observations from.
[1:53:15.160 --> 1:53:16.160]  Wow.
[1:53:16.160 --> 1:53:17.160]  In as much.
[1:53:17.160 --> 1:53:18.160]  Yeah.
[1:53:18.160 --> 1:53:19.160]  It wasn't fun.
[1:53:19.160 --> 1:53:21.160]  I was making money.
[1:53:21.160 --> 1:53:22.160]  Good enough.
[1:53:22.160 --> 1:53:25.160]  They're doing helpful that help over there.
[1:53:25.160 --> 1:53:29.160]  But when I visited both Bandung, which is on the border between China and North Korea.
[1:53:29.160 --> 1:53:32.160]  And I've seen the DMZ down in South Korea.
[1:53:32.160 --> 1:53:38.160]  What Donald Trump is doing in order to foster through capitalism, a method of bridging peace
[1:53:38.160 --> 1:53:42.160]  between North and South Korea is amazing.
[1:53:42.160 --> 1:53:48.160]  First and foremost, however, to compare this to how his political policies with Venezuela,
[1:53:48.160 --> 1:53:51.160]  it's going to have to look at it from a cultural standpoint.
[1:53:51.160 --> 1:53:55.160]  The main reason why North Korean South Korea are better off to do pieces because they have
[1:53:55.160 --> 1:53:59.160]  a shared culture that goes back thousands of years, a shared language.
[1:53:59.160 --> 1:54:05.160]  And in that regard, it incentivizes North Korea to just kind of see, look at what America
[1:54:05.160 --> 1:54:06.160]  has done for South Korea.
[1:54:06.160 --> 1:54:08.160]  You know what I mean?
[1:54:08.160 --> 1:54:09.160]  No, I agree.
[1:54:09.160 --> 1:54:14.160]  I mean, even even liberal publications that have composed say, we've got to have regime
[1:54:14.160 --> 1:54:15.160]  change in Venezuela.
[1:54:15.160 --> 1:54:18.160]  They're saying it can become the next North Korea.
[1:54:18.160 --> 1:54:19.160]  Right.
[1:54:19.160 --> 1:54:22.160]  And also because of its area, it's actual statistical.
[1:54:22.160 --> 1:54:25.160]  It's, I'm sorry, not just a statistical strategic area.
[1:54:25.160 --> 1:54:31.160]  It is similar to how Cuba could be used as a staging ground for potential warfare.
[1:54:31.160 --> 1:54:34.160]  If you think about it, you know, what, you know, when it's...
[1:54:34.160 --> 1:54:35.160]  Oh, absolutely.
[1:54:35.160 --> 1:54:39.160]  I mean, it's right there in Northeast South America surrounded by four countries.
[1:54:39.160 --> 1:54:42.160]  It's very strategic and it's very, very rich in oil.
[1:54:42.160 --> 1:54:45.160]  I mean, Venezuela's got more oil than Texas.
[1:54:45.160 --> 1:54:46.160]  Exactly.
[1:54:46.160 --> 1:54:49.160]  And if you think about it like this, it's not just Russia that's going to be interested
[1:54:49.160 --> 1:54:50.160]  in getting a foothold there.
[1:54:50.160 --> 1:54:51.160]  It's going to be China.
[1:54:51.160 --> 1:54:55.660]  China is already interested in a huge foothold in South America because of all the blast
[1:54:55.660 --> 1:54:57.160]  oil reserves off the coast of Argentina.
[1:54:57.160 --> 1:55:02.160]  You know, I forgot to add, you know, China is testing its social credit surveillance
[1:55:02.160 --> 1:55:03.160]  score.
[1:55:03.160 --> 1:55:04.160]  Oh, in Venezuela.
[1:55:04.160 --> 1:55:08.520]  I've been, I've been following you in China before you got the platform there, before
[1:55:08.520 --> 1:55:12.160]  you got a part of the ad block with Facebook and everything eight, 10 years ago.
[1:55:12.160 --> 1:55:13.160]  Wow.
[1:55:13.160 --> 1:55:15.200]  I mean, I found you out back then.
[1:55:15.200 --> 1:55:19.320]  And I loved what you had to expose with prison, planet and with info wars.
[1:55:19.320 --> 1:55:23.800]  And I want to let you know that some of the information that, that they're blocking there
[1:55:23.800 --> 1:55:27.360]  and they're testing out there with the facial recognition software, the social credit scores,
[1:55:27.360 --> 1:55:31.160]  we have something similar, but it's through the corporate crony system of the capitalist
[1:55:31.160 --> 1:55:33.480]  tech companies, obviously.
[1:55:33.480 --> 1:55:38.560]  With that being said, going back to the difference between North Korea and Venezuela is that,
[1:55:38.560 --> 1:55:41.600]  remember, North Korea is a dictatorship.
[1:55:41.600 --> 1:55:46.000]  And the thing is that Kim Jong-un is like Ocasio, he's like 35.
[1:55:46.000 --> 1:55:49.880]  And the thing is, is that he knows he can get overthrown and end up like a doffy.
[1:55:49.880 --> 1:55:54.080]  And the thing is that he understands that once he visited South Korea, he saw the high
[1:55:54.080 --> 1:55:59.040]  speed and a better than in America, the railway system, the infrastructure and all of that
[1:55:59.040 --> 1:56:02.840]  is because America has been defending and protecting South Korea and allowing them
[1:56:02.840 --> 1:56:03.840]  to embrace capitalism.
[1:56:03.840 --> 1:56:04.840]  Exactly.
[1:56:04.840 --> 1:56:05.840]  They don't have to have a defense budget.
[1:56:05.840 --> 1:56:07.340]  We pay for it all.
[1:56:07.340 --> 1:56:08.340]  Exactly.
[1:56:08.340 --> 1:56:12.720]  And with all that combined, North Korea wants to be on our, on our foothold because South
[1:56:12.720 --> 1:56:17.240]  Korea, because China right now is realizing that they're only, they're only, they're realizing
[1:56:17.240 --> 1:56:20.520]  that even if North Korea decides to start being friendly with South Korea, they're going
[1:56:20.520 --> 1:56:22.120]  to unify their culture first.
[1:56:22.120 --> 1:56:23.120]  Oh, exactly.
[1:56:23.120 --> 1:56:26.160]  And people don't know about the cultures.
[1:56:26.160 --> 1:56:28.160]  China's had all these wars with Japan.
[1:56:28.160 --> 1:56:30.920]  Japan's had all these wars with China and the Koreans.
[1:56:30.920 --> 1:56:34.880]  And the Chinese historically really have had big wars with the Koreans.
[1:56:34.880 --> 1:56:39.880]  And China has helped keep communism in charge and to make sure that there's no development
[1:56:39.880 --> 1:56:44.520]  in North Korea, the best move would be North Korea to merge with South Korea and to make
[1:56:44.520 --> 1:56:45.760]  a deal with the United States.
[1:56:45.760 --> 1:56:50.200]  But again, Kim Jong-un, as you said very astutely, because you've lived there, knows the minute
[1:56:50.200 --> 1:56:53.040]  he really tries that, the Chinese will kill his ass.
[1:56:53.040 --> 1:56:55.280]  So Trump is putting pressure on the Chinese.
[1:56:55.280 --> 1:56:57.240]  Don't do that.
[1:56:57.240 --> 1:57:00.920]  And we're going to put major pressure on you if you don't let us do this with North
[1:57:00.920 --> 1:57:01.920]  Korea.
[1:57:01.920 --> 1:57:05.400]  That's why what Trump is doing is very sophisticated, but also very hard.
[1:57:05.400 --> 1:57:07.000]  I mean, Trump is bold.
[1:57:07.000 --> 1:57:08.680]  It is a bold move.
[1:57:08.680 --> 1:57:09.960]  I think it's a beautiful move.
[1:57:09.960 --> 1:57:10.960]  It's a bold move.
[1:57:10.960 --> 1:57:14.640]  And the thing is that the difference between how Venezuela is being helped with, you got
[1:57:14.640 --> 1:57:16.320]  to look at it from a cultural standpoint.
[1:57:16.320 --> 1:57:20.640]  Colombia, the surrounding areas around it, like Brazil, these countries have a shared
[1:57:20.640 --> 1:57:23.440]  Latin American culture with Venezuela.
[1:57:23.440 --> 1:57:26.600]  And I feel that it's probably going to be more interested, even though that Brazil is
[1:57:26.600 --> 1:57:29.880]  a part of the brick of Russia, India and China.
[1:57:29.880 --> 1:57:34.240]  The fact is that they just now allowed guns in Brazil for the average person.
[1:57:34.240 --> 1:57:36.280]  They're the populist government there taking footholds.
[1:57:36.280 --> 1:57:40.160]  I guarantee you there's going to be significant arms trafficking that America is not going
[1:57:40.160 --> 1:57:43.920]  to need to do in order for the revolution to be able to take footholds there.
[1:57:43.920 --> 1:57:44.920]  All right.
[1:57:44.920 --> 1:57:45.920]  Hey, Peter, smart guy.
[1:57:45.920 --> 1:57:46.920]  Thanks for giving us all your information.
[1:57:46.920 --> 1:57:51.200]  You know, the worst part about getting old, and I'm still strong at 45, is that I won't
[1:57:51.200 --> 1:57:52.400]  be there for my children someday.
[1:57:52.400 --> 1:57:54.320]  That's why I need to make them strong now.
[1:57:54.320 --> 1:57:56.040]  Now I can be there for my children.
[1:57:56.040 --> 1:57:57.920]  Now I can make them strong.
[1:57:57.920 --> 1:57:59.520]  Now I can instruct them.
[1:57:59.520 --> 1:58:02.360]  Now I can teach them what I've learned, but not once I'm gone.
[1:58:02.360 --> 1:58:05.320]  You think of this digital age, your word's going forever, but now they're using better
[1:58:05.320 --> 1:58:07.520]  getting rid of what you said they were before.
[1:58:07.520 --> 1:58:12.200]  It's so much easier to burn video or text or languages now that we have high tech book
[1:58:12.200 --> 1:58:13.200]  burning, isn't it?
[1:58:13.200 --> 1:58:16.600]  But I have joined my will to the resistance.
[1:58:16.600 --> 1:58:20.880]  I can't be destroyed now as long as I realize I've done right and the longer the people
[1:58:20.880 --> 1:58:25.720]  know the truth and you can't be destroyed either as long as you bind yourself to something
[1:58:25.720 --> 1:58:28.640]  and commit to it and go through the fire for it.
[1:58:28.640 --> 1:58:33.360]  There is a magic that then takes place that trends in space and time when you commit be
[1:58:33.360 --> 1:58:36.920]  a word of mouth or to pray for us or to spread our articles and videos.
[1:58:36.920 --> 1:58:42.240]  That overrides everything the enemy's doing, so please now commit to support InfoWars
[1:58:42.240 --> 1:58:48.720]  however you can and realize your provision to InfoWars is your own provision.
[1:58:48.720 --> 1:58:49.720]  It's simple.
[1:58:49.720 --> 1:58:52.520]  If you want to beat the globalists, if you want to take on the new world order, I'm not
[1:58:52.520 --> 1:58:55.200]  doing Bitcoin pumping dumps with Jack Dorsey.
[1:58:55.200 --> 1:58:57.680]  I'm not sitting here selling you cancer cures.
[1:58:57.680 --> 1:59:01.320]  I'm not sitting here, you know, selling you late term abortion and all the great it is.
[1:59:01.320 --> 1:59:04.320]  I just go out and say what is the top heart pill?
[1:59:04.320 --> 1:59:08.560]  What is the top tumor is the best seller because it's anti-inflammatory and what's the best
[1:59:08.560 --> 1:59:09.560]  lab in the country?
[1:59:09.560 --> 1:59:10.560]  Okay, they're the highest rate.
[1:59:10.560 --> 1:59:12.040]  I'm like, you're only 50% curcuminoid?
[1:59:12.040 --> 1:59:16.120]  Well, yeah, they only put $5 product in the bottle, but that's still incredible, sir.
[1:59:16.120 --> 1:59:21.400]  I'm like, what's the highest you could do a month later, 90, 95% no one's ever done
[1:59:21.400 --> 1:59:22.400]  it.
[1:59:22.400 --> 1:59:24.360]  I said, how much did that cost for a bottle that costs $10?
[1:59:24.360 --> 1:59:25.760]  No one's ever done that, sir.
[1:59:25.760 --> 1:59:28.000]  The average competitor is three to 5%.
[1:59:28.000 --> 1:59:29.000]  The top brand is 50%.
[1:59:29.000 --> 1:59:31.600]  I'm like, we're going to have 95% curcuminoid.
[1:59:31.600 --> 1:59:34.920]  I mean, you understand, like that's like our information is explosive.
[1:59:34.920 --> 1:59:38.040]  Our fish oil, I go out and I get the cleanest, the best.
[1:59:38.040 --> 1:59:39.160]  My children take it.
[1:59:39.160 --> 1:59:43.480]  You think I'm going to give you fish oil that isn't the very damn best on my soul?
[1:59:43.480 --> 1:59:46.520]  You think I'm going to screw somebody over like one of these devil worshipers?
[1:59:46.520 --> 1:59:47.520]  Never.
[1:59:47.520 --> 1:59:51.520]  Enforceware.com.
[1:59:51.520 --> 2:00:05.760]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[2:00:05.760 --> 2:00:30.040]  You better believe that the US is about to move militarily against Venezuela.
[2:00:30.040 --> 2:00:35.040]  The tea leaves are very, very clear.
[2:00:35.040 --> 2:00:38.080]  And the sky is gray.
[2:00:38.080 --> 2:00:42.680]  And the Russians and the Iranians move it in there is going to elicit military taps.
[2:00:42.680 --> 2:00:49.720]  You just bet your bottom dollar it's going to happen next week, next month, maybe tomorrow.
[2:00:49.720 --> 2:00:51.720]  Like night following day.
[2:00:51.720 --> 2:00:57.440]  And I don't sit there and go, oh yeah, great, get to watch some war on TV.
[2:00:57.440 --> 2:00:59.040]  We shouldn't be in Ukraine.
[2:00:59.040 --> 2:01:00.960]  We shouldn't have overthrown their country.
[2:01:00.960 --> 2:01:05.760]  We shouldn't have moved troops in to battle Russians in areas that are 90% Russian where
[2:01:05.760 --> 2:01:07.720]  Russia was founded.
[2:01:07.720 --> 2:01:08.720]  I'm not a Russophile.
[2:01:08.720 --> 2:01:10.600]  I'm a survival file.
[2:01:10.600 --> 2:01:14.320]  And I don't like starting wars with people for no reason.
[2:01:14.320 --> 2:01:17.960]  Now I know Trump inherited all these messes and I get that he's trying to do the peace
[2:01:17.960 --> 2:01:22.720]  deal right now and it's a beautiful thing with what's happened with North Korea.
[2:01:22.720 --> 2:01:29.120]  But it's been said that more happens historically sometimes in a year that happens in the next
[2:01:29.120 --> 2:01:35.320]  50 and we're entering that zone now of everything being compressed and accelerated.
[2:01:35.320 --> 2:01:45.360]  And you can look at the body language of Godero and all the rest of it and just bottom line.
[2:01:45.360 --> 2:01:51.880]  Guido and others know that they tried the olive branch with Madero and he was dumb enough
[2:01:51.880 --> 2:01:57.760]  to have his military attack those convoys and then admitted he did it.
[2:01:57.760 --> 2:02:05.280]  That is not going to go well for him.
[2:02:05.280 --> 2:02:08.960]  And I guarantee you the U.S. has all its different operatives in there trying to get somebody
[2:02:08.960 --> 2:02:17.320]  to kill the Venezuelan leader so that a big war isn't needed.
[2:02:17.320 --> 2:02:19.960]  But regardless, it's all about to happen.
[2:02:19.960 --> 2:02:24.360]  You can just tell the body language, the whole deal, it's on in my opinion.
[2:02:24.360 --> 2:02:29.800]  Things may pull back, things may change, but currently we are about to go to war with Venezuela.
[2:02:29.800 --> 2:02:34.800]  That means with the dictatorship, with the regime that's teetering on the edge of collapse
[2:02:34.800 --> 2:02:35.800]  right now.
[2:02:35.800 --> 2:02:38.080]  I want to go to phone calls.
[2:02:38.080 --> 2:02:39.080]  We will the next hour.
[2:02:39.080 --> 2:02:40.080]  We have two guests joining us as well.
[2:02:40.080 --> 2:02:41.080]  But I'll get there.
[2:02:41.080 --> 2:02:42.080]  Everybody's on the board.
[2:02:42.080 --> 2:02:46.120]  Can we turn up audio from this raw satellite feed from Colombia again bordering Venezuela?
[2:02:46.120 --> 2:02:49.120]  Let's try to turn that up.
[2:02:49.120 --> 2:02:51.560]  Vice President Mike Pence is giving a speech.
[2:02:51.560 --> 2:03:03.080]  And again, most of this is not being talked about, this is not on U.S. television.
[2:03:03.080 --> 2:03:26.320]  The American people are proud to work with Colombia, to provide assistance, to help
[2:03:26.320 --> 2:03:44.200]  you and your families as you fled from the oppression and the deprivation that has fallen
[2:03:44.200 --> 2:03:45.200]  upon Venezuela.
[2:03:45.200 --> 2:03:52.280]  By the way, if your TV viewer, radio listeners all describe it, it's U.S. aid, that State
[2:03:52.280 --> 2:03:54.840]  Department money to the U.N.
[2:03:54.840 --> 2:03:56.600]  That's what Soros gets the money for that.
[2:03:56.600 --> 2:03:57.760]  He doesn't give his own money.
[2:03:57.760 --> 2:04:03.400]  He gets the money, because Hillary put his people in, and then he funds the caravans.
[2:04:03.400 --> 2:04:07.520]  This is Trump using U.S. aid to actually help Venezuelans, and of course, so the Communist
[2:04:07.520 --> 2:04:27.080]  government stands strong with the only legitimate President of Venezuela, President Juan Guadela.
[2:04:27.080 --> 2:04:37.800]  All right, we're going to go to break, we've got more of your calls coming up.
[2:04:37.800 --> 2:04:38.800]  Stay with us.
[2:04:38.800 --> 2:04:39.800]  So much to cover.
[2:04:39.800 --> 2:04:44.920]  If you didn't know, basically Russia is openly threatening nuclear war now for the United
[2:04:44.920 --> 2:04:50.440]  States over all this, because nuclear weapons have been moved into Ukraine to the Russian
[2:04:50.440 --> 2:04:51.440]  border and the Polish border.
[2:04:51.440 --> 2:05:05.480]  So the Russians are now escalating, we're right back.
[2:05:05.480 --> 2:05:12.200]  By leaps and by bounds, the number one best-selling supplement family in the world is energy
[2:05:12.200 --> 2:05:18.200]  drinks and energy supplements, but they are riddled with dyes and toxins and synthetic
[2:05:18.200 --> 2:05:22.480]  caffeine and other chemicals that sure get you a quick boost but burn out in just a few
[2:05:22.480 --> 2:05:24.560]  hours and have terrible side effects.
[2:05:24.560 --> 2:05:31.120]  We have developed, hands down from our research, the most powerful, healthy energy drink, pre-workout
[2:05:31.120 --> 2:05:33.360]  and beyond system in the world.
[2:05:33.360 --> 2:05:36.440]  If there's nothing else like it, you must experience it.
[2:05:36.440 --> 2:05:41.440]  It is a total game changer, and it comes in easy to use, packets to mix in with fruges
[2:05:41.440 --> 2:05:43.640]  or water, whatever you'd like.
[2:05:43.640 --> 2:05:47.240]  Warning though, it's very, very strong, it lasts up to 10 hours, so take a half packet
[2:05:47.240 --> 2:05:51.320]  the first time you take it, because TurboForce is named TurboForce because it will take you
[2:05:51.320 --> 2:05:52.320]  into overdrive.
[2:05:52.320 --> 2:05:53.320]  TurboForce and enforcelife.com.
[2:05:53.320 --> 2:05:58.320]  This is an emergency transmission from deep in the heart of Texas, the U.S. resistance
[2:05:58.320 --> 2:06:03.760]  against a global corporate combine, empowered and funded by Communist China, allied with
[2:06:03.760 --> 2:06:07.440]  the big mega banks that set up Communist China in 1949.
[2:06:07.440 --> 2:06:11.760]  The Communist Chinese have taken control of U.S. telecommunications infrastructure.
[2:06:11.760 --> 2:06:13.880]  The Communist Chinese have taken control of Hollywood.
[2:06:13.880 --> 2:06:15.960]  The Communist Chinese have taken control of the main universities.
[2:06:15.960 --> 2:06:18.520]  This is all confirmed, this is not a drill.
[2:06:18.520 --> 2:06:22.400]  Big Tech and Silicon Valley is almost completely run by the Communist Chinese government.
[2:06:22.400 --> 2:06:27.560]  They've officially become state-run, Apple 100%, Google is now making the transition
[2:06:27.560 --> 2:06:30.680]  and announcing a merger in total worldwide censorship.
[2:06:30.680 --> 2:06:35.480]  They are now beta testing using me as the straw man, a demonized version of Alex Jones
[2:06:35.480 --> 2:06:36.480]  to do that.
[2:06:36.480 --> 2:06:37.480]  This is happening.
[2:06:37.480 --> 2:06:41.560]  This is not like the other probes before that were meant to get you used to probes and censorship,
[2:06:41.560 --> 2:06:46.280]  thinking you would adapt to censorship by just putting up with it now.
[2:06:46.280 --> 2:06:50.600]  This attack is thousands and thousands and thousands of times the magnitude of all previous
[2:06:50.600 --> 2:06:51.600]  attacks.
[2:06:51.600 --> 2:06:57.200]  This is a tight-traded dose, reverse psychological warfare operation using adapt and overcome
[2:06:57.200 --> 2:06:59.200]  subversion paradigm manipulation.
[2:06:59.200 --> 2:07:04.200]  In layman's terms, they are manipulating the fact that we adapt to being oppressed.
[2:07:04.200 --> 2:07:07.720]  We adapt to being pressed with the low dosages of oppression.
[2:07:07.720 --> 2:07:13.560]  Now when the megaton hits us of the total takeover, we try to adapt to the poison infusion
[2:07:13.560 --> 2:07:18.240]  instead of not knowing it's a lethal dose if we accept the dose.
[2:07:18.240 --> 2:07:22.360]  Total Internet of Things, integration, global social score, complete command and control
[2:07:22.360 --> 2:07:23.360]  system.
[2:07:23.360 --> 2:07:28.480]  It is the virtual reality AI weapons system now attacking the United States with traders
[2:07:28.480 --> 2:07:33.280]  inside the major security agencies, blocking Trump's resistance of the program and attempting
[2:07:33.280 --> 2:07:38.280]  to stop us from removing the tentacles of the chai-coms-slash-big-tech-making-combine-emergency
[2:07:38.280 --> 2:07:39.280]  situation.
[2:07:39.280 --> 2:07:42.600]  I have been chosen for destruction because I brought you this information and have been
[2:07:42.600 --> 2:07:45.480]  battering, ramming and out as much as I can.
[2:07:45.480 --> 2:07:50.720]  They want to double-use me as they always do in any complex system of mathematical deception
[2:07:50.720 --> 2:07:54.240]  where every angle of my good is turned against us.
[2:07:54.240 --> 2:07:59.040]  So they take what I've said, being sincere, build me into an insincere person in the strawman.
[2:07:59.040 --> 2:08:03.200]  I'm a person that cares about life and children and is against these wars and so they make
[2:08:03.200 --> 2:08:04.200]  me a herder of children.
[2:08:04.200 --> 2:08:08.800]  And then they build me into this lie to then set the distraction while they're actually
[2:08:08.800 --> 2:08:12.200]  censoring all of you to make a debate about Alex Jones.
[2:08:12.200 --> 2:08:18.160]  So even if I didn't sell out to them, they now use me as an archetype to serve them by
[2:08:18.160 --> 2:08:19.960]  being the main distraction.
[2:08:19.960 --> 2:08:24.880]  I have now been captured by the enemy in the information warfare fulcrum and is being used
[2:08:24.880 --> 2:08:25.880]  against you.
[2:08:25.880 --> 2:08:30.480]  Only your full understanding of this key will break you free from this paradigm.
[2:08:30.480 --> 2:08:37.160]  I have given you the transmission, now break free!
[2:08:37.160 --> 2:08:44.400]  I have sworn upon the altar of God, eternal hostility against every form of tyranny over
[2:08:44.400 --> 2:08:49.400]  the mind of man, Thomas Jefferson.
[2:08:49.400 --> 2:08:53.400]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[2:08:53.400 --> 2:09:08.760]  Josh and Carlos and Grant and Douglas and Mitchell and Freedom and Griffin, we're all
[2:09:08.760 --> 2:09:11.880]  riding shotgun together, Owen Benjamin's in the next hour.
[2:09:11.880 --> 2:09:14.920]  We may take a little bit of that time to make sure I get even more calls in.
[2:09:14.920 --> 2:09:17.280]  In fact, we've got a bunch of calls on the board but I'm going to put the phones back
[2:09:17.280 --> 2:09:21.200]  up on any subject you want to discuss, the Robert Barnes or Joe Bannister or myself or
[2:09:21.200 --> 2:09:25.560]  Venezuela or Trump's trip to North Korea, it's a free-for-all as our good friend Ted
[2:09:25.560 --> 2:09:33.560]  Nugent would say, 877-789-2539, 877-789 Alex, we're going to go to John and Josh and Carlos
[2:09:33.560 --> 2:09:37.560]  and Grant and Douglas and Mitchell and Freedom and Griffin, I will at least get to those
[2:09:37.560 --> 2:09:38.560]  calls.
[2:09:38.560 --> 2:09:39.800]  How to do this on purpose?
[2:09:39.800 --> 2:09:45.200]  I know you guys know each other from the big legal dream team he had when they were trying
[2:09:45.200 --> 2:09:48.960]  to put him in jail for his free speech as a former treasury agent and then a San Francisco
[2:09:48.960 --> 2:09:54.960]  liberal jury said no, Joe Bannister is a patriot and that's kind of the discussion today but
[2:09:54.960 --> 2:10:00.920]  you are already going to be here in town on separate issues with what we're doing versus
[2:10:00.920 --> 2:10:01.920]  that.
[2:10:01.920 --> 2:10:04.880]  So you're not even so much here to talk about his case, he's here to talk about his case.
[2:10:04.880 --> 2:10:10.600]  His book just now came out, it's available at infowarstore.com, investigating the federal
[2:10:10.600 --> 2:10:17.200]  income tax, a report to the American people, Joseph R. Bannister, former IRS special agent
[2:10:17.200 --> 2:10:22.800]  meaning he was actually a badge and a gun and that's a whole other story but I remember
[2:10:22.800 --> 2:10:27.560]  interviewing Joe, gosh it's got to be, it feels like 20 years ago, he remembers all
[2:10:27.560 --> 2:10:32.600]  the dates as a smart CPA and former federal agent but you look at all the things he went
[2:10:32.600 --> 2:10:36.800]  through and trying to take his CPA license, trying to put him in prison, it's just been
[2:10:36.800 --> 2:10:41.720]  incredible and then contemporarily lowest learner getting away with all the persecution.
[2:10:41.720 --> 2:10:45.560]  I mean back when people were talking about IRS persecution 20 years ago when Joe was
[2:10:45.560 --> 2:10:49.240]  in prison, you were from the outside of the inside, I was like, oh is that really happening?
[2:10:49.240 --> 2:10:53.640]  Now it's just, oh yeah, we targeted tens of thousands of conservatives and Christian groups
[2:10:53.640 --> 2:10:57.720]  and MSNBC says they deserve it, they're racist.
[2:10:57.720 --> 2:11:02.320]  You know, Trump's a KKK member, Michael Cohen, he's not getting in trouble for any Russiagates
[2:11:02.320 --> 2:11:07.120]  for supposedly not paying taxes, he's put guilty to that so good to have you here with
[2:11:07.120 --> 2:11:13.240]  us in studio, Robert Barnes and of course good to have Joe Bannister here with us as
[2:11:13.240 --> 2:11:14.240]  well.
[2:11:14.240 --> 2:11:21.840]  So agentfortruthjb.webbly.com, we'll just link to it up on infowars.com, good to have
[2:11:21.840 --> 2:11:23.400]  you here with us, so much happening.
[2:11:23.400 --> 2:11:29.120]  Thanks Alex, hi Robert, it's agentfortruth.com, we'll work just fine, there's a little issue
[2:11:29.120 --> 2:11:31.560]  but if people type that in, that'll work just fine.
[2:11:31.560 --> 2:11:34.520]  Just type that in the search, it's in Joe Bannister, we'll find it.
[2:11:34.520 --> 2:11:40.080]  Yeah, great to see you, thanks for having me on, real excited about the new book.
[2:11:40.080 --> 2:11:45.640]  The original book, of course 20 years ago, just before you interviewed me when I resigned
[2:11:45.640 --> 2:11:51.200]  from the IRS was investigating the federal income tax, a preliminary report, I tend to
[2:11:51.200 --> 2:11:56.680]  be pretty humble and of course I wasn't sure at the time if maybe I had missed something,
[2:11:56.680 --> 2:12:02.600]  of course I'm not a superior court judge or a supreme court justice, but I did the best
[2:12:02.600 --> 2:12:07.740]  that I could being a CPA at the time and an IRS criminal investigator who had taken an
[2:12:07.740 --> 2:12:10.520]  oath to support and defend the Constitution.
[2:12:10.520 --> 2:12:15.240]  And so I called it a preliminary report 20 years ago and I think I've certainly reached
[2:12:15.240 --> 2:12:20.040]  the point where I can call it a report to the American people, I've been trying to tell
[2:12:20.040 --> 2:12:25.400]  the American people about this issue for 20 years and the person that's helped me get
[2:12:25.400 --> 2:12:29.160]  that message out really the best has been you Alex and of course your whole crew.
[2:12:29.160 --> 2:12:33.560]  Well I appreciate that, but Joe let's talk about your findings, we're going to go break
[2:12:33.560 --> 2:12:35.640]  in a moment, come back in a longer segment.
[2:12:35.640 --> 2:12:41.120]  What is the IRS, what is the 1913 Act, what is the Federal Reserve, in a three minute
[2:12:41.120 --> 2:12:45.560]  summation of all your deep research on the inside and the outside, what is it and what
[2:12:45.560 --> 2:12:47.360]  are they hiding?
[2:12:47.360 --> 2:12:53.000]  What the people need to know is that in 1913 both the Federal Reserve Act and the 16th
[2:12:53.000 --> 2:12:58.400]  Amendment came into existence and that wasn't a coincidence.
[2:12:58.400 --> 2:13:03.680]  The monetary system and the income tax are joined at the hip, they're married, they have
[2:13:03.680 --> 2:13:08.560]  to be because one can't really function without the other.
[2:13:08.560 --> 2:13:14.440]  So people need to understand that it's not a coincidence, 1913 some very significant
[2:13:14.440 --> 2:13:23.320]  things happened to our country and that was the start of now over 100 years of fraud and
[2:13:23.320 --> 2:13:24.320]  deceit.
[2:13:24.320 --> 2:13:28.920]  I know a lot of your listeners are well familiar with the Federal Reserve, the creation of
[2:13:28.920 --> 2:13:31.120]  fiat money.
[2:13:31.120 --> 2:13:37.280]  But the thing is our founders, they try to protect us from the dystopia that we now find
[2:13:37.280 --> 2:13:39.480]  ourselves living in.
[2:13:39.480 --> 2:13:45.440]  And so thankfully the income tax and the Federal Reserve are like these square pegs that they
[2:13:45.440 --> 2:13:49.640]  try to put into the round hole that they just don't fit.
[2:13:49.640 --> 2:13:53.200]  So of course that's why I would encourage people to check out the book, check out my
[2:13:53.200 --> 2:13:59.840]  website and look at old videos that start, unfortunately a lot of them have been banned
[2:13:59.840 --> 2:14:03.040]  right thanks to YouTube.
[2:14:03.040 --> 2:14:07.200]  Good information, truthful information gets banned and censored.
[2:14:07.200 --> 2:14:15.200]  So I mean they tried to put you in prison for your speech as a CPA and now it's just
[2:14:15.200 --> 2:14:18.920]  widespread just censorship control everywhere Robert.
[2:14:18.920 --> 2:14:19.920]  Oh, absolutely.
[2:14:19.920 --> 2:14:23.640]  I mean, in the 20 years that I've been involved in these issues of people I've represented,
[2:14:23.640 --> 2:14:27.760]  the person I've met of the most highest character, if I was in any kind of trouble, if I needed
[2:14:27.760 --> 2:14:31.720]  someone to look after my daughter, if I needed someone to look after everything related to
[2:14:31.720 --> 2:14:35.160]  me financially, if I needed anything like that, Joe Bannister would be at the top of
[2:14:35.160 --> 2:14:36.160]  that list.
[2:14:36.160 --> 2:14:40.440]  Talking about a man with an exceptional character, exceptional history, he won awards, he goes
[2:14:40.440 --> 2:14:43.560]  down to Glencoe to get training, they make him class president.
[2:14:43.560 --> 2:14:47.880]  That's who Joe Bannister is and all he did and you can tell by his demeanor and disposition,
[2:14:47.880 --> 2:14:52.960]  he's not some flamboyant person, he's not grandstanding, if anything he tends to understate.
[2:14:52.960 --> 2:14:57.000]  And what he did is he just asked some questions and people who had given him awards, given
[2:14:57.000 --> 2:15:00.080]  him honors, given him recognition, wouldn't answer those questions.
[2:15:00.080 --> 2:15:05.000]  Instead, they were so scared of the questions, they target him to take away his license,
[2:15:05.000 --> 2:15:08.680]  take away his right to practice, take away ultimately his freedom and now they're trying
[2:15:08.680 --> 2:15:10.200]  to take away his speech.
[2:15:10.200 --> 2:15:14.600]  And it's been a pattern of, there's no reason to fear the speech if the speech is obviously
[2:15:14.600 --> 2:15:15.600]  false.
[2:15:15.600 --> 2:15:17.360]  We're going to go to break, but let's separate this.
[2:15:17.360 --> 2:15:20.680]  Let's say the income tax is legal and lawful, we know it's a fraud, makes you waive your
[2:15:20.680 --> 2:15:21.960]  fourth amendment, all that.
[2:15:21.960 --> 2:15:24.400]  Let's just say for the sake of debate, okay, fine.
[2:15:24.400 --> 2:15:29.360]  Just selectively enforce, 50 CPAs give you a different answer, 50 lawyers give you a
[2:15:29.360 --> 2:15:33.320]  different answer and then now it's a group that persecutes people for their political
[2:15:33.320 --> 2:15:34.320]  views.
[2:15:34.320 --> 2:15:35.840]  Now it's over our healthcare records.
[2:15:35.840 --> 2:15:40.400]  It's like, it's the Gestapo and so we'll get Joe Bannister's take on that and more.
[2:15:40.400 --> 2:15:45.080]  His new book just came out, Investigating the Federal Income Tax, it's the report to
[2:15:45.080 --> 2:15:50.240]  American people, not the preliminary, 20 years in the works, infowarstore.com, get your copy

[2:16:56.200 --> 2:17:00.120]  I started fighting the IRS over 40 years ago when they tried to seize my mother's house.
[2:17:00.120 --> 2:17:01.680]  I sued the IRS in one.
[2:17:01.680 --> 2:17:04.640]  I beat the IRS then and I've been beating them ever since.

[2:21:21.280 --> 2:21:22.280]  going to prove them wrong.
[2:21:22.280 --> 2:21:25.760]  Those researchers ask questions, they say resign.
[2:21:25.760 --> 2:21:30.600]  Years later, he's just doing radio interviews and stuff, they indict him.
[2:21:30.600 --> 2:21:31.680]  The jury says no.
[2:21:31.680 --> 2:21:39.240]  So Joe, looking at the persecution the IRS has been involved in now, as I said before
[2:21:39.240 --> 2:21:44.360]  the break and jump in, Mr. Barnes, anytime you want, we'll go to call the next segment
[2:21:44.360 --> 2:21:52.000]  all over the map, but no, you're a smart guy, you can talk to any of these issues.
[2:21:52.000 --> 2:21:56.520]  Separate from debating whether the income taxes is constitutional or not, what about
[2:21:56.520 --> 2:22:01.720]  it being this giant arm of persecution and being above the law and admitting it's doing
[2:22:01.720 --> 2:22:05.160]  it and not getting in trouble?
[2:22:05.160 --> 2:22:06.160]  That's absolutely right.
[2:22:06.160 --> 2:22:11.320]  I mean, I don't quite get why the American people aren't more incensed about this.
[2:22:11.320 --> 2:22:18.840]  I mean, if one of their neighbors was trying to control them or even a sibling or anyone,
[2:22:18.840 --> 2:22:24.560]  people would come unglued if they knew that somebody was trying to manipulate their thinking
[2:22:24.560 --> 2:22:26.520]  and swindle them.
[2:22:26.520 --> 2:22:32.680]  And yet we have a federal government that over a span of 100 years has figured out
[2:22:32.680 --> 2:22:36.840]  a way to swindle hundreds of millions of people.
[2:22:36.840 --> 2:22:40.760]  By the way, I'm going to interrupt you because that was so profound.
[2:22:40.760 --> 2:22:45.440]  I mean, I'm sweet to my wife, she's sweet to me, but if I even joke around or she jokes
[2:22:45.440 --> 2:22:48.800]  around, hey, you're not going to tell me what to do, my kids are the same way.
[2:22:48.800 --> 2:22:52.680]  But if it's government or corrupt agencies, we just accept it.
[2:22:52.680 --> 2:22:54.240]  How is there that paradox?
[2:22:54.240 --> 2:23:02.040]  Well, like I said before, it's amazing to me that our founders knew what to protect
[2:23:02.040 --> 2:23:06.400]  against as best they could in the 1700s.
[2:23:06.400 --> 2:23:11.400]  And they gave us those protections, but of course the missing link or the variable that's
[2:23:11.400 --> 2:23:20.640]  up to us is what we do to protect and to promote, preserve what they left to us.
[2:23:20.640 --> 2:23:25.440]  And that variable hasn't been in the equation as much as it should be.
[2:23:25.440 --> 2:23:30.760]  And so it really is up to us to say, we're tired of this, we've endured it for a long
[2:23:30.760 --> 2:23:31.760]  time.
[2:23:31.760 --> 2:23:38.200]  You've often said, Alex, about how people take our demeanor, our truthfulness, our humbleness,
[2:23:38.200 --> 2:23:40.760]  humility to be a weakness.
[2:23:40.760 --> 2:23:44.560]  And I think that's the way that the federal government, especially the taxing apparatus,
[2:23:44.560 --> 2:23:46.680]  views the public.
[2:23:46.680 --> 2:23:47.680]  It's very predatory.
[2:23:47.680 --> 2:23:52.240]  So what, because America is exceptional, it was exceptional, 4% of the population had
[2:23:52.240 --> 2:23:54.520]  half the wealth in 1954.
[2:23:54.520 --> 2:23:57.840]  Now it's a lot of it's been stolen now, but it doesn't mean we're perfect, but compared
[2:23:57.840 --> 2:24:02.720]  to other nations, other systems, what was to Joe and then to Robert Barnes?
[2:24:02.720 --> 2:24:04.600]  What is the American exceptionalism?
[2:24:04.600 --> 2:24:09.600]  Because all the media and Hollywood does is tell us how much we suck, how bad we are.
[2:24:09.600 --> 2:24:10.880]  Well, they own this country.
[2:24:10.880 --> 2:24:13.360]  Why would they devalue their own product?
[2:24:13.360 --> 2:24:17.120]  Because they're threatened by something, I think it's spiritual at the end of the day.
[2:24:17.120 --> 2:24:18.120]  Robert?
[2:24:18.120 --> 2:24:19.120]  Sure.
[2:24:19.120 --> 2:24:22.600]  Well, I mean, I think at a certain core foundational level, the reason why Joe's questions raised
[2:24:22.600 --> 2:24:26.920]  such a stir was because it goes to the core of almost every political revolt and revolution
[2:24:26.920 --> 2:24:28.840]  that's ever happened in the history of the world.
[2:24:28.840 --> 2:24:33.600]  We'll start with a tax as its basis of a political revolt, that there's something that's wrong
[2:24:33.600 --> 2:24:36.000]  and usually what they're complaining about is not monetary.
[2:24:36.000 --> 2:24:38.320]  They're not saying, oh, I want X amount of money.
[2:24:38.320 --> 2:24:42.240]  For example, in Joe's case, he put money aside for the trust in case there was any tax, it
[2:24:42.240 --> 2:24:44.720]  was actually, no, it says this government doesn't represent me.
[2:24:44.720 --> 2:24:45.720]  Precisely.
[2:24:45.720 --> 2:24:46.720]  Exactly.
[2:24:46.720 --> 2:24:47.720]  It goes to a spiritual issue.
[2:24:47.720 --> 2:24:50.400]  They're objecting not because they don't want to pay a certain amount of money.
[2:24:50.400 --> 2:24:53.520]  They're objecting because they're saying what's happening here is immoral.
[2:24:53.520 --> 2:24:54.920]  What's happening here is illegal.
[2:24:54.920 --> 2:24:56.720]  What's happening here is anti-democratic.
[2:24:56.720 --> 2:24:58.320]  What's happening here is against our founding principle.
[2:24:58.320 --> 2:25:00.520]  Because people will give if they think it's for good.
[2:25:00.520 --> 2:25:01.520]  Absolutely.
[2:25:01.520 --> 2:25:02.520]  They'll be happy to.
[2:25:02.520 --> 2:25:05.520]  In fact, some of the biggest were the most charitable country in the world by far.
[2:25:05.520 --> 2:25:08.600]  Our people are the most charitable country in the world by far.
[2:25:08.600 --> 2:25:11.560]  So what they were scared of and what they're worried about is people are saying there's
[2:25:11.560 --> 2:25:15.520]  something about this system that's not being done consistent with our founding principles.
[2:25:15.520 --> 2:25:20.320]  And it's those founding, the people who have power want to have that power without restraint.
[2:25:20.320 --> 2:25:21.320]  Exactly.
[2:25:21.320 --> 2:25:25.040]  The fact that we have so much freedom gets in the way of a vertical command.
[2:25:25.040 --> 2:25:26.040]  Precisely.
[2:25:26.040 --> 2:25:30.200]  The oligarchic, monopolistic, uniform control that they want.
[2:25:30.200 --> 2:25:35.400]  And people like Joe, who just took his obligation to the Constitution seriously, took what
[2:25:35.400 --> 2:25:38.520]  his duties were to the public seriously, is the one that has to be.
[2:25:38.520 --> 2:25:39.520]  And I want to be clear.
[2:25:39.520 --> 2:25:42.520]  The Pentagon has good people, but the globalists run it.
[2:25:42.520 --> 2:25:46.160]  And if you go back to Abel Dey's or their documents, they said, we're not worried about
[2:25:46.160 --> 2:25:47.160]  bad people.
[2:25:47.160 --> 2:25:48.160]  We're about interesting people.
[2:25:48.160 --> 2:25:51.840]  And we're worried about empowered individuals that can motivate others.
[2:25:51.840 --> 2:25:53.680]  And that would be a Joe banister.
[2:25:53.680 --> 2:25:56.360]  They're worried about people that actually have a compass.
[2:25:56.360 --> 2:26:02.200]  So Barnes has given his expert view on that, and you've got an expert view on that as well.
[2:26:02.200 --> 2:26:05.440]  What is the lightning in a bottle they're so scared of?
[2:26:05.440 --> 2:26:12.560]  Well, as you've pointed out, you and Infowars, Alex have pointed out, the deep state, the
[2:26:12.560 --> 2:26:15.680]  term deep state is understood by so many more Americans.
[2:26:15.680 --> 2:26:23.280]  And I've referred to the IRS and the Department of Justice as the original deep state operations.
[2:26:23.280 --> 2:26:32.200]  As Robert pointed out, you really can't orchestrate the level of tyranny that they are attempting
[2:26:32.200 --> 2:26:38.560]  to and succeeding in orchestrating if you do not have people by the, you know what,
[2:26:38.560 --> 2:26:42.440]  and that is done with the income tax and the monetary system.
[2:26:42.440 --> 2:26:48.640]  So I hate to advocate to put this issue at the top because the priority list has-
[2:26:48.640 --> 2:26:49.640]  No, no.
[2:26:49.640 --> 2:26:52.000]  The power of the purse is the power of the tax power destroyed.
[2:26:52.000 --> 2:26:54.320]  Well, look, they give the IRS all the jobs.
[2:26:54.320 --> 2:26:58.640]  I mean, I'm not supposed to say this, we're going to fall lawsuits, but well, I'll get
[2:26:58.640 --> 2:26:59.640]  to it later.
[2:26:59.640 --> 2:27:02.080]  But no, it's the IRS that's tasked with putting on your bank account.
[2:27:02.080 --> 2:27:03.360]  You're a hater now.
[2:27:03.360 --> 2:27:07.880]  So my A++ rating went to zero and they take my bank accounts away, Joe.
[2:27:07.880 --> 2:27:12.440]  Well, Alex, and I'm glad you're at least telling people what's happening to you personally
[2:27:12.440 --> 2:27:18.080]  and to Infowars because the fact of the matter is American people better start getting more
[2:27:18.080 --> 2:27:23.960]  active soon because as we go to a cashless society, there will be no turning back.
[2:27:23.960 --> 2:27:28.120]  You will have no property that you can call your own that you have in your possession
[2:27:28.120 --> 2:27:30.520]  and they'll flick a switch and you'll be done.
[2:27:30.520 --> 2:27:35.360]  You won't even be done talking to people and exercising your first amendment, right?
[2:27:35.360 --> 2:27:38.000]  You're going to be done eating.
[2:27:38.000 --> 2:27:39.000]  That's so profound.
[2:27:39.000 --> 2:27:40.000]  I was going to bring that up today.
[2:27:40.000 --> 2:27:45.480]  As your CPA accountant or Treasury agent, your lawyer, tax expert, they're already abusing
[2:27:45.480 --> 2:27:49.320]  the cashless system, a bunch of countries are going cashless, they can already control
[2:27:49.320 --> 2:27:52.040]  what I can type on my phone.
[2:27:52.040 --> 2:27:56.320]  And so now they're going to have control at the level of your phone of what news you
[2:27:56.320 --> 2:27:57.320]  look at.
[2:27:57.320 --> 2:28:01.440]  And now they're saying, you don't play ball, we'll just, your credit card, even though
[2:28:01.440 --> 2:28:04.520]  you paid that money, you work, you put it in the bank, it's worthless.
[2:28:04.520 --> 2:28:05.520]  It's all gone.
[2:28:05.520 --> 2:28:06.520]  Precisely.
[2:28:06.520 --> 2:28:07.680]  And it relates to what Joe talks about.
[2:28:07.680 --> 2:28:11.800]  Their method of controlling speech is for the same banking financial system predicated
[2:28:11.800 --> 2:28:12.800]  upon the Federal Reserve.
[2:28:12.800 --> 2:28:16.440]  And the Federal Reserve is the banking elite, which uses the IRS as its enforcer.
[2:28:16.440 --> 2:28:19.640]  So Joe's like, I don't want to say my issue is the king of the hill.
[2:28:19.640 --> 2:28:20.640]  No, it is.
[2:28:20.640 --> 2:28:21.640]  Yeah, it is.
[2:28:21.640 --> 2:28:25.400]  Because at the core of it, there's no political, like, Noam Chomsky said this back in the 1960s.
[2:28:25.400 --> 2:28:29.920]  He said, if you seriously want to change the Vietnam War, then don't pay income tax and
[2:28:29.920 --> 2:28:32.240]  challenge how the income tax is being used for the war.
[2:28:32.240 --> 2:28:34.560]  He said, because that's the only thing that would actually be successful.
[2:28:34.560 --> 2:28:36.760]  All the war protests in the world ain't going to do nothing.
[2:28:36.760 --> 2:28:40.720]  You get 10, 20% of the people to look at the tax system as a way of war protests.
[2:28:40.720 --> 2:28:42.240]  You're going to shut down a war tomorrow.
[2:28:42.240 --> 2:28:45.040]  The tax system, the financial system is the key to everything.
[2:28:45.040 --> 2:28:48.920]  Let's talk about it with Joe Bannister and Robert Barnes right here on All Inch Shows.
[2:28:48.920 --> 2:28:49.920]  Spread this live feed.
[2:28:49.920 --> 2:28:55.120]  It's an action rebellion in FullWars.com for a slash show.

[2:29:00.200 --> 2:29:04.360]  I was 35 with two beautiful children when my life and addiction started to spiral out
[2:29:04.360 --> 2:29:05.480]  of control.
[2:29:05.480 --> 2:29:10.840]  After my divorce, I went into a depression cycle and started drinking more often and
[2:29:10.840 --> 2:29:12.680]  using prescription drugs.
[2:29:12.680 --> 2:29:16.960]  After my second DWI and arrest, my ex-husband threatened to take our children away from
[2:29:16.960 --> 2:29:17.960]  me.
[2:29:17.960 --> 2:29:20.960]  I was 17 when I became addicted to heroin and meth.
[2:29:20.960 --> 2:29:24.520]  I thought I could quit on my own, but I couldn't.
[2:29:24.520 --> 2:29:27.200]  It hit me when I was arrested.
[2:29:27.200 --> 2:29:28.680]  Get sober now.

[2:30:19.800 --> 2:30:24.000]  that sure get you a quick boost but burn out in just a few hours and have terrible side

[2:30:45.000 --> 2:30:46.500]  It lasts up to 10 hours.
[2:30:46.500 --> 2:30:50.600]  So take a half packet the first time you take it because Turbo Force is named Turbo Force

[2:30:56.360 --> 2:31:01.240]  As the years go by, it gets harder and harder to keep up with your body's nutritional needs.
[2:31:01.240 --> 2:31:05.720]  With changes in diet, unnatural ingredients and stress, you may not be able to get all

[2:32:02.560 --> 2:32:06.360]  at about $2.50 a piece.
[2:32:06.360 --> 2:32:10.120]  Comfortable bars are between $5 and $7 a piece to add whole foods.
[2:32:10.120 --> 2:32:11.520]  This is high end.
[2:32:11.520 --> 2:32:14.680]  When you get one box, you get them at basically $3.
[2:32:14.680 --> 2:32:19.480]  You get them for $2.50 or so when you get it at the current launch discount.
[2:32:19.480 --> 2:32:24.200]  This took over a year to get the top manufacturer and developer in the country to get it all
[2:32:24.200 --> 2:32:28.360]  ready and to have the manufacturing line prepared and to make this.
[2:32:28.360 --> 2:32:30.760]  It's available exclusively at InfowarsLife.com.
[2:32:30.760 --> 2:32:31.760]  It's simple.
[2:32:31.760 --> 2:32:35.800]  You get the highest quality protein bars in two different flavors and you fund the war
[2:32:35.800 --> 2:32:39.680]  against the globalist and the attempt that we're engaged in to take the country back.
[2:32:39.680 --> 2:32:40.680]  It's simple.
[2:32:40.680 --> 2:32:44.600]  Go shop with the good guys at InfowarsStore.com and break the back of the globalist and get
[2:32:44.600 --> 2:32:46.560]  high quality super discounts.
[2:32:46.560 --> 2:32:50.760]  Or keep shopping with Jeff Bezos and Amazon and keep going to Whole Foods that are actually
[2:32:50.760 --> 2:32:54.760]  funding the Washington Post and the globalist attempt to destroy this country.
[2:32:54.760 --> 2:32:55.760]  It's that simple.
[2:32:55.760 --> 2:32:56.760]  InfowarsLife.com.
[2:32:56.760 --> 2:33:07.440]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[2:33:07.440 --> 2:33:32.440]  From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[2:33:32.440 --> 2:33:49.960]  Joe Bannister, a fellow I've known for at least 20 years, former treasury agent, just
[2:33:49.960 --> 2:33:50.960]  asked questions.
[2:33:50.960 --> 2:33:51.960]  They told him design.
[2:33:51.960 --> 2:33:53.520]  He went public, spoke out about it.
[2:33:53.520 --> 2:33:54.520]  Boom.
[2:33:54.520 --> 2:33:55.800]  They tried to put it in prison repeatedly.
[2:33:55.800 --> 2:33:59.160]  One of the lawyers that worked with him on some of these cases, Robert Barnes, just
[2:33:59.160 --> 2:34:00.680]  happens to be here working on.
[2:34:00.680 --> 2:34:04.880]  So my first case is right now and doing a great job.
[2:34:04.880 --> 2:34:06.360]  I promised to go to your call.
[2:34:06.360 --> 2:34:10.160]  So we're going to keep Bannister and you guys about 15 minutes to the next hour so we can
[2:34:10.160 --> 2:34:14.960]  get more into the things that both of you guys want to get into, which is Joe Bannister
[2:34:14.960 --> 2:34:17.200]  is dealing with the deep state.
[2:34:17.200 --> 2:34:21.480]  Joe's message to President Trump and so much more in his new book, Investigating the Federal
[2:34:21.480 --> 2:34:24.120]  Income Tax, Reports to American People.
[2:34:24.120 --> 2:34:26.560]  The first issue he won 20 years ago is called a preliminary report.
[2:34:26.560 --> 2:34:27.560]  I remember that.
[2:34:27.560 --> 2:34:30.840]  So now this is the report.
[2:34:30.840 --> 2:34:31.840]  It's very, very important.
[2:34:31.840 --> 2:34:35.560]  Everybody get it enforced for.com to understand what you're dealing with.
[2:34:35.560 --> 2:34:47.280]  Now, before we go any further, speaking of the devil, which is money, we have a bigger
[2:34:47.280 --> 2:34:52.840]  audience than we've ever had when it comes to actual movers and shakers and activists,
[2:34:52.840 --> 2:34:54.360]  smart people.
[2:34:54.360 --> 2:34:59.080]  Our influence, and I don't just say the stat cool or powerful, it's actually scary.
[2:34:59.080 --> 2:35:01.800]  Our influence is greater than it's ever been.
[2:35:01.800 --> 2:35:09.480]  If I told you who the people that have called me the last week, basically threatening in
[2:35:09.480 --> 2:35:14.080]  a very loving way, I mean, it's household names beyond that.
[2:35:14.080 --> 2:35:19.160]  People I thought were on board with never backing down.
[2:35:19.160 --> 2:35:23.880]  The globalists are behind the scenes, running intelligence operations, threatening everyone
[2:35:23.880 --> 2:35:25.640]  and seeing who they can get.
[2:35:25.640 --> 2:35:29.880]  Well, if you don't want money, how about fear and you're going to lose because they're
[2:35:29.880 --> 2:35:33.560]  getting their move ready on Trump because he's shaping up the, he's shaking up the
[2:35:33.560 --> 2:35:35.880]  entire system.
[2:35:35.880 --> 2:35:40.640]  But when it comes down to financially supporting info wars, it's not critical.
[2:35:40.640 --> 2:35:42.400]  It's essential.
[2:35:42.400 --> 2:35:46.240]  So I know the vast majority of you spread the articles and tell folks about the show.
[2:35:46.240 --> 2:35:48.680]  That's great.
[2:35:48.680 --> 2:35:51.680]  But if you'll just get your toothpaste from us, if you'll just get your coffee from us,
[2:35:51.680 --> 2:35:55.840]  if you'll just get your protein bars from us, they're all the highest quality at lower
[2:35:55.840 --> 2:36:01.360]  prices and you don't get it whole foods and you just get staples from us and it funds
[2:36:01.360 --> 2:36:02.360]  the operation.
[2:36:02.360 --> 2:36:05.160]  And we have the new strength and recovery combo.
[2:36:05.160 --> 2:36:12.720]  Our turmeric bodies, ultimate tumor formula is 95% curcuminoid, leading competitors 5%.
[2:36:12.720 --> 2:36:14.040]  And people get a good result on that.
[2:36:14.040 --> 2:36:17.600]  Everybody knows about turmeric for inflammation, all of it.
[2:36:17.600 --> 2:36:23.240]  And then of course we also have alpha power that goes with it, that has all the natural
[2:36:23.240 --> 2:36:26.280]  healthy herbs for stamina, libido, energy.
[2:36:26.280 --> 2:36:30.840]  Quite frankly, I can't even take it because I actually, for my age, have a high testosterone
[2:36:30.840 --> 2:36:31.840]  level.
[2:36:31.840 --> 2:36:36.560]  I've had my blood tested and things and problem is it retrogrades and turns into, turns into
[2:36:36.560 --> 2:36:37.560]  estrogen too quickly.
[2:36:37.560 --> 2:36:38.560]  And there's things like that.
[2:36:38.560 --> 2:36:41.480]  But the point is I take alpha power, I bounce off the walls.
[2:36:41.480 --> 2:36:45.480]  The average person though has way low testosterone, all sorts of issues.
[2:36:45.480 --> 2:36:48.840]  We went out and said, what is the ultimate formula?
[2:36:48.840 --> 2:36:49.920]  And we just made it stronger.
[2:36:49.920 --> 2:36:50.920]  That's alpha power.
[2:36:50.920 --> 2:36:55.960]  They're both together 50% off and then for store.com right now today.
[2:36:55.960 --> 2:36:57.560]  And it'll blow you away.
[2:36:57.560 --> 2:37:00.640]  So take advantage of that and then for store.com.
[2:37:00.640 --> 2:37:03.880]  We're going to go to phone calls for this segment and the next, which will be all over
[2:37:03.880 --> 2:37:04.880]  the map.
[2:37:04.880 --> 2:37:05.880]  But you guys are both smart.
[2:37:05.880 --> 2:37:11.040]  You can chime in on it and then we'll get into the IRS and Banister's message to Trump
[2:37:11.040 --> 2:37:15.040]  will get your message to Trump, Robert Barnes, constitutional lawyer as well.
[2:37:15.040 --> 2:37:18.120]  But because people have been holding so long, who's been holding the longest?
[2:37:18.120 --> 2:37:21.880]  We've got Mitchell is an hour and 12 minutes.
[2:37:21.880 --> 2:37:24.320]  Freedom fighter an hour and 20 minutes.
[2:37:24.320 --> 2:37:29.320]  Josh, 121 minutes, not 101 hour, 121 minutes, I'm saying this wrong.
[2:37:29.320 --> 2:37:34.480]  Carlos Montreal, 101 hour, 121 minutes, so suddenly can't read numbers.
[2:37:34.480 --> 2:37:35.680]  So who should we go to?
[2:37:35.680 --> 2:37:36.840]  Let's go to Sean.
[2:37:36.840 --> 2:37:42.360]  Sean's only been holding 27 minutes and 41 seconds, but they disagree.
[2:37:42.360 --> 2:37:43.760]  So let's hear what Sean has to say.
[2:37:43.760 --> 2:37:45.360]  Sean, you're on the air.
[2:37:45.360 --> 2:37:46.360]  Go ahead.
[2:37:46.360 --> 2:37:47.360]  Hey, Alex McMahon.
[2:37:47.360 --> 2:37:51.560]  First of all, I want to say brain force is the best investment you can make in yourself
[2:37:51.560 --> 2:37:52.560]  in your career.
[2:37:52.560 --> 2:37:54.560]  I take it every day.
[2:37:54.560 --> 2:37:58.120]  We went out and found the top new tropic and just discounted the price, but thank you,
[2:37:58.120 --> 2:37:59.120]  sir.
[2:37:59.120 --> 2:38:00.120]  So what do you disagree with?
[2:38:00.120 --> 2:38:01.120]  Go ahead.
[2:38:01.120 --> 2:38:05.120]  What you said about Rubio earlier in the Godbeat tweet.
[2:38:05.120 --> 2:38:11.320]  I am very close to somebody who is in the media in his way about can they would be kind
[2:38:11.320 --> 2:38:16.800]  of on the entertainment side like the British are happy with, and they talk to politicians.
[2:38:16.800 --> 2:38:22.120]  They've talked to the generals, they've talked to people in the military, and they're scared
[2:38:22.120 --> 2:38:24.320]  and they could end this right now.
[2:38:24.320 --> 2:38:29.280]  They could kill Maduro in the end, but they don't think America's going to come.
[2:38:29.280 --> 2:38:34.560]  They don't think there's going to be a war, and they think this is going to go on forever.
[2:38:34.560 --> 2:38:40.040]  There's some 1% that controls all the wealth.
[2:38:40.040 --> 2:38:43.000]  So I kind of get what Rubio was doing.
[2:38:43.000 --> 2:38:47.200]  By the way, if you're listening, you know who this is, Alex, you probably know who it
[2:38:47.200 --> 2:38:54.640]  is because I've sent you videos through Showtips that they have sent me since the 23rd of last
[2:38:54.640 --> 2:38:55.640]  month.
[2:38:55.640 --> 2:39:02.320]  Gateway Pondant has published on Miami Herald, but yeah, it's pretty bad down there.
[2:39:02.320 --> 2:39:06.160]  This is about the closest you can come to the Holocaust, and whatever we're seeing in
[2:39:06.160 --> 2:39:14.480]  the news, it's even worse, and something's got to be done, and I hope Maduro gets killed
[2:39:14.480 --> 2:39:17.480]  by his own people, and if that's the green flag that Rubio put out.
[2:39:17.480 --> 2:39:22.720]  Well, the word is, it is societal collapse in the midst of volcanic soil, the best growing
[2:39:22.720 --> 2:39:26.200]  area, oil, diamonds, everything is collapsing.
[2:39:26.200 --> 2:39:28.080]  I appreciate your call.
[2:39:28.080 --> 2:39:30.320]  Let's get Joe Bannister's take on that.
[2:39:30.320 --> 2:39:35.200]  Everywhere we see socialism failing, communism failing, but that AOC is promoting it, what
[2:39:35.200 --> 2:39:38.040]  do you think should be done about Venezuela?
[2:39:38.040 --> 2:39:41.600]  Because I don't want to do regime change, because usually the neocons just make it worse,
[2:39:41.600 --> 2:39:43.200]  but what do we do about this?
[2:39:43.200 --> 2:39:52.800]  Well, I'm certainly concerned about the America's track record for intervening in other quagmires,
[2:39:52.800 --> 2:39:57.720]  and of course, I'm also concerned about the excuses that are used to bring us into those
[2:39:57.720 --> 2:40:04.720]  quagmires, and how those excuses don't generally turn out to be truthful.
[2:40:04.720 --> 2:40:12.360]  So I don't know, but as far as the socialism goes, Venezuela is certainly a good illustration
[2:40:12.360 --> 2:40:18.040]  of where it goes, and I, again, would like the American people to recognize that the
[2:40:18.040 --> 2:40:25.160]  income tax and the Federal Reserve are the mechanisms that can take a country into socialism,
[2:40:25.160 --> 2:40:26.960]  and has gone quite a ways.
[2:40:26.960 --> 2:40:27.960]  So that's the enemy.
[2:40:27.960 --> 2:40:32.600]  By the way, there's a monetary global system less than 100 years that puts in the exact
[2:40:32.600 --> 2:40:36.680]  thing as the Federal Reserve in these countries before they take them from wealthy to poor.
[2:40:36.680 --> 2:40:37.680]  Oh, precisely.
[2:40:37.680 --> 2:40:42.160]  And it's also now become the tools and the primary means and mechanism by which you can
[2:40:42.160 --> 2:40:46.320]  control speech, censor speech, shame speech, isolate speech.
[2:40:46.320 --> 2:40:49.880]  They started this out on people like Joe, where the IRS was bringing special actions
[2:40:49.880 --> 2:40:54.560]  to prevent him from being able to fundraise in his own defense.
[2:40:54.560 --> 2:40:59.560]  So they tested it out against Joe, and now they're doing it more broad scale, more wholesale,
[2:40:59.560 --> 2:41:00.560]  and what you see in Venezuela.
[2:41:00.560 --> 2:41:01.760]  By the way, you're not just saying that.
[2:41:01.760 --> 2:41:02.760]  He was a famous case.
[2:41:02.760 --> 2:41:03.760]  He was patient zero.
[2:41:03.760 --> 2:41:04.960]  Oh, absolutely.
[2:41:04.960 --> 2:41:07.240]  It was a huge privilege to represent Joe.
[2:41:07.240 --> 2:41:11.760]  And that was a liberal jury that said not guilty of all charges, period, that he didn't
[2:41:11.760 --> 2:41:14.760]  have any fraudulent intent, that he didn't have any criminal intent.
[2:41:14.760 --> 2:41:18.520]  But what the jury said was that the con was on the side of the prosecution.
[2:41:18.520 --> 2:41:22.960]  That was the closing argument that I co-wrote with Jeffrey Dixdine, which was which side
[2:41:22.960 --> 2:41:24.440]  is the con on?
[2:41:24.440 --> 2:41:28.400]  And I remember brainstorming it in the diesel hotel in Sacramento, which otherwise I don't
[2:41:28.400 --> 2:41:29.400]  recommend.
[2:41:29.400 --> 2:41:30.400]  God bless the city.
[2:41:30.400 --> 2:41:32.840]  And but basically led to that outcome.
[2:41:32.840 --> 2:41:37.080]  But the effect of that outcome stayed the government's hand and stayed the system's
[2:41:37.080 --> 2:41:40.040]  hand, but it didn't stop them from going on their ultimate path.
[2:41:40.040 --> 2:41:42.800]  And they've taken the same things they were trying to do to Joe, and they're trying to
[2:41:42.800 --> 2:41:45.080]  do it more broad scale, more wholesale.
[2:41:45.080 --> 2:41:49.760]  They're trying to use you now and info wars now as if we can blacklist info wars, if we
[2:41:49.760 --> 2:41:54.920]  can terrify people from listening to and responding and being part of the community and sharing
[2:41:54.920 --> 2:41:59.000]  in the community and being connected to the community so that the audience chooses what
[2:41:59.000 --> 2:42:03.360]  to believe, the audience chooses what news to believe, then they could have the power
[2:42:03.360 --> 2:42:04.840]  to completely suppress speech.
[2:42:04.840 --> 2:42:10.080]  So what you see in Venezuela is an extreme example of the same Chinese based big tech
[2:42:10.080 --> 2:42:15.600]  control model of free speech modulation that's using the bank and financial system here in
[2:42:15.600 --> 2:42:16.600]  the United States.
[2:42:16.600 --> 2:42:18.160]  We're just in the earlier stages of it.
[2:42:18.160 --> 2:42:22.120]  I was about to say, Venezuela 10 years ago wasn't this bad.
[2:42:22.120 --> 2:42:24.840]  It incrementally just gets worse as they need more control.
[2:42:24.840 --> 2:42:25.840]  Precisely.
[2:42:25.840 --> 2:42:28.980]  Because the other backstory here is this is really a proxy war with China.
[2:42:28.980 --> 2:42:30.640]  It's China that's deeply embedded.
[2:42:30.640 --> 2:42:35.440]  As you noted earlier, China was using Venezuela as a test case for their social media crediting
[2:42:35.440 --> 2:42:36.440]  problems policies.
[2:42:36.440 --> 2:42:38.040]  So that's what's happening.
[2:42:38.040 --> 2:42:41.920]  Venezuela was sort of like a proxy of China and the way Cuba used to be a proxy of the
[2:42:41.920 --> 2:42:42.920]  Soviet Union.
[2:42:42.920 --> 2:42:43.920]  And it looks like it's not going too well.
[2:42:43.920 --> 2:42:44.920]  Oh, no, it's completely failed.
[2:42:44.920 --> 2:42:45.920]  Don't you think it's holding?
[2:42:45.920 --> 2:42:47.920]  Oh, we'll take your credit away.
[2:42:47.920 --> 2:42:49.440]  I'll just burn everything down.
[2:42:49.440 --> 2:42:50.440]  Exactly.
[2:42:50.440 --> 2:42:51.440]  It didn't function at all.
[2:42:51.440 --> 2:42:52.440]  People are starving.
[2:42:52.440 --> 2:42:53.440]  So it doesn't ultimately...
[2:42:53.440 --> 2:42:54.440]  Hold on.
[2:42:54.440 --> 2:42:55.440]  Hold on.
[2:42:55.440 --> 2:42:56.440]  Stay there.
[2:42:56.440 --> 2:42:57.440]  We'll be right back with Joe Manos.
[2:42:57.440 --> 2:42:59.200]  There is no set stasis.
[2:42:59.200 --> 2:43:00.440]  There is no managed system.
[2:43:00.440 --> 2:43:02.000]  There is no un-continuum.
[2:43:02.000 --> 2:43:05.280]  The continuum is always launching forward in the future.
[2:43:05.280 --> 2:43:08.600]  So you support us and get creative and get fired up.
[2:43:08.600 --> 2:43:09.800]  We won't just be here a hundred years.
[2:43:09.800 --> 2:43:10.800]  We'll be here forever.
[2:43:10.800 --> 2:43:11.900]  We'll turn the whole thing around.
[2:43:11.900 --> 2:43:16.320]  Our grandchildren on Mars bases and jump bases and God knows what are going to look
[2:43:16.320 --> 2:43:18.760]  back and say, you know, we struggled here.
[2:43:18.760 --> 2:43:19.760]  We made it.
[2:43:19.760 --> 2:43:21.160]  And that's really where this goes.
[2:43:21.160 --> 2:43:23.360]  But God's got a big war for you ready.
[2:43:23.360 --> 2:43:28.000]  And so if you can't face George Soros and Hillary Clinton and Adolf Hitler and Mao Zedong,
[2:43:28.000 --> 2:43:30.560]  are you going to really be able to face the other stuff?
[2:43:30.560 --> 2:43:34.760]  Because God wants warriors that are smart and are ready to build things and are also
[2:43:34.760 --> 2:43:35.760]  ready to fight.
[2:43:35.760 --> 2:43:38.360]  You don't go to the next level without getting a big weight put on your back.
[2:43:38.360 --> 2:43:40.360]  And I mean, I don't know what's going to happen to me in the future.
[2:43:40.360 --> 2:43:44.000]  I mean, all I know is I want to go with the master built.
[2:43:44.000 --> 2:43:45.200]  I want to go to the next level.
[2:43:45.200 --> 2:43:49.800]  I want to be with the spirit that I've experienced, not these devil worshipers.
[2:43:49.800 --> 2:43:52.440]  They're cold and failed and feels like being a tomb.
[2:43:52.440 --> 2:43:53.600]  I want life.
[2:43:53.600 --> 2:43:54.600]  I want Jesus.
[2:43:54.600 --> 2:44:00.080]  I've been doing a lot of research into Google and YouTube censorship.
[2:44:00.080 --> 2:44:05.440]  And I've noticed that there's one type of video that is the most censored, the most
[2:44:05.440 --> 2:44:08.600]  buried, the most suppressed.
[2:44:08.600 --> 2:44:15.280]  And that's the videos where you saw in 2016 election night all the arrogant, leftist
[2:44:15.280 --> 2:44:20.920]  authoritarians like the young turds and others get so butt hurt when Trump won.
[2:44:20.920 --> 2:44:22.840]  They don't want us to have that victory.
[2:44:22.840 --> 2:44:25.920]  They don't want us to remember what political action did.
[2:44:25.920 --> 2:44:31.280]  And that's why the globalist Hillary and others are trying to shut in for us now.
[2:44:31.280 --> 2:44:36.360]  This is a fight about taking your speech away, not just my speech about taking your very
[2:44:36.360 --> 2:44:37.800]  sovereignty away.
[2:44:37.800 --> 2:44:40.080]  This country is in a war.
[2:44:40.080 --> 2:44:43.880]  So again, I want to thank you for what you've done, but I want to remind you if you don't
[2:44:43.880 --> 2:44:47.240]  spread the articles and videos and if you don't financially get the great products we have
[2:44:47.240 --> 2:44:50.600]  and fund us in the 360 wind, we're dead in the water.
[2:44:50.600 --> 2:44:51.600]  I'm in your hands.
[2:44:51.600 --> 2:44:52.600]  You're in my hands.

[2:47:19.760 --> 2:47:46.880]  Thank you.
[2:47:46.880 --> 2:47:48.880]  Joe Bannister is our guest.
[2:47:48.880 --> 2:47:53.280]  I want to invite him back up for a full hour in the near future, just he and I to take
[2:47:53.280 --> 2:47:58.520]  IRS questions for folks, but his new book is out investigating the federal income tax
[2:47:58.520 --> 2:48:05.240]  at InfowarsTour.com, it's also on his website, Asia for Truth, and this isn't somebody saying
[2:48:05.240 --> 2:48:10.240]  of his gold fringe on the flag that it means, and I'm not knocking people to think that.
[2:48:10.240 --> 2:48:18.840]  My point is this is not hyperbole, it's not rumors, it's not, because here's the deal.
[2:48:18.840 --> 2:48:22.840]  People want to believe, hey, the law says this, as you said last night, so government's
[2:48:22.840 --> 2:48:25.880]  breaking it, there must be a second set of law, no, they're just breaking it.
[2:48:25.880 --> 2:48:28.920]  And that's why I'm not against the QAnon thing, oh, it's great to believe there's a great
[2:48:28.920 --> 2:48:34.200]  secret group, and everything's fixed, and everything's wonderful, and BuzzFeed is outing
[2:48:34.200 --> 2:48:39.120]  some pastry maker at the president's of our logo, wanting her fired, being bullies.
[2:48:39.120 --> 2:48:42.960]  Great, QAnon, wonderful, okay, the government's all wonderful, we're going to fix it.
[2:48:42.960 --> 2:48:49.080]  The point is, is that people need to know what's really the research is, 20 years like
[2:48:49.080 --> 2:48:56.760]  Joe Bannister's done, like you've done, versus what some guy just claims, oh, this is how
[2:48:56.760 --> 2:49:01.680]  it is, just do this, you'll be fine, because nine times out of 10, you go to prison with
[2:49:01.680 --> 2:49:03.880]  the made up gold fringe flag thing.
[2:49:03.880 --> 2:49:07.920]  Correct, exactly, in fact, a lot of those ideas came into marginalized people who had
[2:49:07.920 --> 2:49:08.920]  serious and sincere questions.
[2:49:08.920 --> 2:49:12.480]  You had a lot of people who said, like, why am I waiting in my fifth amendment or fourth
[2:49:12.480 --> 2:49:13.480]  amendment?
[2:49:13.480 --> 2:49:16.400]  Exactly, I mean, why is the law written in this way, I mean, why can't you answer just
[2:49:16.400 --> 2:49:20.920]  this basic question, why can't you just respond to me, 90% of the people that are targeted
[2:49:20.920 --> 2:49:25.320]  in this area just asked questions that the IRS refused to answer, that's all, and all
[2:49:25.320 --> 2:49:28.640]  Joe did was go through and he's just sharing his experience, here's what happened, here's
[2:49:28.640 --> 2:49:33.480]  what I researched, use the techniques I have, and you draw your own conclusions, you empower
[2:49:33.480 --> 2:49:38.360]  ordinary people to make decisions, to take political action based on your political speech,
[2:49:38.360 --> 2:49:42.240]  and yet he was targeted, and they try to lock him up in prison for more than a decade.
[2:49:42.240 --> 2:49:46.000]  I mean, that was the goal and objective, and it was a liberal lefty jury who found him
[2:49:46.000 --> 2:49:47.640]  not guilty of all charges.
[2:49:47.640 --> 2:49:50.040]  They were the ones who said, this should never have happened.
[2:49:50.040 --> 2:49:53.520]  They thought our legal team actually, they thought all of us were lefties, I mean, because
[2:49:53.520 --> 2:49:57.000]  that was the nature of the case, because what we presented is they're being, Joe is being
[2:49:57.000 --> 2:49:59.380]  targeted purely for political reasons.
[2:49:59.380 --> 2:50:02.720]  No one could be around Joe and come to the conclusion that he was anything other than
[2:50:02.720 --> 2:50:03.720]  on.
[2:50:03.720 --> 2:50:06.720]  Well, as bad as the old left was, they were still for free speech and things, the new
[2:50:06.720 --> 2:50:11.280]  left, Joe Bannister, what would you call the new left and what they've kind of morphed
[2:50:11.280 --> 2:50:19.880]  into, or mutated into, and then get into why you're saying the IRS is the deep state?
[2:50:19.880 --> 2:50:27.080]  Well, yeah, the left of today is, they're just tyrants.
[2:50:27.080 --> 2:50:33.400]  You've put it very well, and I have 20 years of hindsight to look back at, and so hopefully
[2:50:33.400 --> 2:50:40.240]  people will believe me when I say that Alex Jones has been telling you this stuff since
[2:50:40.240 --> 2:50:42.160]  the very beginning.
[2:50:42.160 --> 2:50:46.680]  You've been painting the picture for the public, Alex, and that's why I'm not just
[2:50:46.680 --> 2:50:50.360]  the occasional guest on your show.
[2:50:50.360 --> 2:50:51.360]  I'm a fan.
[2:50:51.360 --> 2:50:57.760]  I mean, I'm religiously following what you guys put out, because it's important, and
[2:50:57.760 --> 2:51:03.320]  it all ties together.
[2:51:03.320 --> 2:51:09.760]  The left of today is a lot scarier than the left of 20 years ago or even 10 years ago,
[2:51:09.760 --> 2:51:18.960]  because they're not the left, but it's preaching to the choir, because you're a smart guy.
[2:51:18.960 --> 2:51:19.960]  What are they?
[2:51:19.960 --> 2:51:22.400]  They're more pro-war than Republicans now.
[2:51:22.400 --> 2:51:23.680]  They don't care they want war.
[2:51:23.680 --> 2:51:25.960]  They're anti-free speech.
[2:51:25.960 --> 2:51:30.920]  All the so-called minority groups are now led by people that sound like Nazis.
[2:51:30.920 --> 2:51:32.880]  They're so bad, I can't believe it.
[2:51:32.880 --> 2:51:33.880]  Oh, precisely.
[2:51:33.880 --> 2:51:38.840]  But really, the birth of the left was in the approach of the Stasi-style approach that
[2:51:38.840 --> 2:51:39.840]  they took to Joe.
[2:51:39.840 --> 2:51:44.320]  I mean, here are people that were his supervisors who knew his honesty, knew his character with
[2:51:44.320 --> 2:51:49.560]  Vouch for his character, and yet felt coerced to this blackmail and this campaign to try
[2:51:49.560 --> 2:51:53.520]  to blacklist him and to try to literally put him in a black hole.
[2:51:53.520 --> 2:51:56.440]  What the left is now is just media stampeding.
[2:51:56.440 --> 2:51:57.440]  It's not left.
[2:51:57.440 --> 2:51:58.440]  It's not right.
[2:51:58.440 --> 2:52:00.440]  It's like hysteria, witch-hunts, stampeding.
[2:52:00.440 --> 2:52:02.000]  It's 1920s left.
[2:52:02.000 --> 2:52:03.840]  It's 1920s communist left.
[2:52:03.840 --> 2:52:05.800]  1920s Stasi-style left.
[2:52:05.800 --> 2:52:08.800]  1920s street violence and Tifa-style left.
[2:52:08.800 --> 2:52:13.560]  The black shirts and the rest were roaming the streets with fighting people just sort
[2:52:13.560 --> 2:52:16.600]  of randomly detargeted for political purposes.
[2:52:16.600 --> 2:52:17.600]  That's who they are.
[2:52:17.600 --> 2:52:19.400]  They're the secret police left.
[2:52:19.400 --> 2:52:22.480]  They're not the free speech left, they're the secret police left.
[2:52:22.480 --> 2:52:23.480]  So they're the enforcers.
[2:52:23.480 --> 2:52:28.520]  I mean, Joe, what would you quantify, Joe Bannister, at the time we're in today in the world?
[2:52:28.520 --> 2:52:31.880]  What would you call this?
[2:52:31.880 --> 2:52:33.280]  We're on the edge of a cliff.
[2:52:33.280 --> 2:52:37.600]  I mean, I'm very grateful that President Trump was elected.
[2:52:37.600 --> 2:52:43.360]  And I think that he's not controlled in the way that presidents throughout my lifetime
[2:52:43.360 --> 2:52:48.080]  and certainly the lifetimes before that that I wasn't alive.
[2:52:48.080 --> 2:52:50.800]  So I'm really encouraged by what I see.
[2:52:50.800 --> 2:52:55.800]  But the thing I'm scared about most is that if President Trump is in for four or even
[2:52:55.800 --> 2:53:02.720]  eight years, what is the opposition got planned for us when he leaves?
[2:53:02.720 --> 2:53:08.160]  And that's why I think that this issue, as I try to lay out in my book, why it's so
[2:53:08.160 --> 2:53:14.120]  critical that we follow up on the income tax and the Federal Reserve and the cashless
[2:53:14.120 --> 2:53:18.920]  society and all these things, because even if President Trump cleans up the swamp as
[2:53:18.920 --> 2:53:25.080]  much as he thinks he can in eight years, we're done for when it comes to the cashless society
[2:53:25.080 --> 2:53:26.080]  and the way that everyone else does.
[2:53:26.080 --> 2:53:29.960]  In fact, I wanted to bring that up with you, Mike, and I'm glad you described it's not
[2:53:29.960 --> 2:53:33.520]  that we're against cashless, except then it lets them turn us off.
[2:53:33.520 --> 2:53:39.040]  We're not against technology and they're abusing tech already.
[2:53:39.040 --> 2:53:44.000]  Imagine once there's no more cash, things are all tracked, they're already coming after
[2:53:44.000 --> 2:53:45.440]  everybody's bank accounts.
[2:53:45.440 --> 2:53:46.840]  This is the total control.
[2:53:46.840 --> 2:53:52.320]  Well, as an illustration, this is anecdotal, but when you're at the coffee shop and you
[2:53:52.320 --> 2:53:58.680]  see a 20-something paying for something with their card and then it doesn't work, and
[2:53:58.680 --> 2:54:04.480]  they're like, oh, and then I'm in line behind them and I've got cash and I walk out with
[2:54:04.480 --> 2:54:05.480]  my coffee.
[2:54:05.480 --> 2:54:08.720]  So it's just people have no idea.
[2:54:08.720 --> 2:54:15.080]  It takes away the options and on your cashless, it gives total surveillance and the total push.
[2:54:15.080 --> 2:54:16.280]  You have no choice.
[2:54:16.280 --> 2:54:17.600]  Now we control you.
[2:54:17.600 --> 2:54:18.600]  Absolutely.
[2:54:18.600 --> 2:54:21.880]  So it's why they perceive threats like Bitcoin.
[2:54:21.880 --> 2:54:25.840]  The cashless society they're predicting is not a Bitcoin society, it is a society where
[2:54:25.840 --> 2:54:29.960]  the banks control the information and where the banks monopolize even more and more information
[2:54:29.960 --> 2:54:30.960]  against you.
[2:54:30.960 --> 2:54:34.680]  So it's like when the IRS started maintaining medical records, it's going to be an extension.
[2:54:34.680 --> 2:54:36.880]  The financial system is going to know your speech records.
[2:54:36.880 --> 2:54:40.880]  There was a great book years ago that Joe cited called Confessions of a Tax Collector,
[2:54:40.880 --> 2:54:44.520]  where an IRS agent just details those almost like Lord Conrad going into the heart of
[2:54:44.520 --> 2:54:45.520]  the jungle.
[2:54:45.520 --> 2:54:48.960]  And what he describes is all the intimate information about an individual he can do
[2:54:48.960 --> 2:54:50.760]  with one little pen stroke.
[2:54:50.760 --> 2:54:53.760]  That's where part of what Joe talks about in his book is that much of the tax laws have
[2:54:53.760 --> 2:54:56.320]  nothing to do with revenue raising whatsoever.
[2:54:56.320 --> 2:55:00.640]  They have to do with social control, political control, state surveillance.
[2:55:00.640 --> 2:55:05.320]  I was talking to somebody that works for a major director or the top directors or the
[2:55:05.320 --> 2:55:07.600]  top three directors.
[2:55:07.600 --> 2:55:10.160]  They kept telling the directors or business partners, well, this will make more money.
[2:55:10.160 --> 2:55:11.160]  They go, it's not about money.
[2:55:11.160 --> 2:55:13.240]  It's about power and control of perception.
[2:55:13.240 --> 2:55:15.240]  We want control of their souls.
[2:55:15.240 --> 2:55:16.560]  What do you mean?
[2:55:16.560 --> 2:55:18.160]  Well, I'll tell you later.
[2:55:18.160 --> 2:55:19.560]  But that's really what this is.
[2:55:19.560 --> 2:55:23.680]  Well, think about it as the most powerful self-confessional tool in the world.
[2:55:23.680 --> 2:55:27.360]  Your tax form discloses who are your personal relationships with?
[2:55:27.360 --> 2:55:28.840]  Who are your family members?
[2:55:28.840 --> 2:55:30.240]  What church do you go to?
[2:55:30.240 --> 2:55:32.040]  What schools are you associated with?
[2:55:32.040 --> 2:55:33.960]  What political causes do you care about?
[2:55:33.960 --> 2:55:35.360]  Who can you contribute to?
[2:55:35.360 --> 2:55:39.520]  The IRS agent pointed out he could know everything about your life by just a couple of keystrokes
[2:55:39.520 --> 2:55:41.080]  on their computer system.
[2:55:41.080 --> 2:55:44.400]  That's why there's first amendment issues with it, fourth amendment issues with it,
[2:55:44.400 --> 2:55:45.880]  fifth amendment issues with it.
[2:55:45.880 --> 2:55:46.960]  So Joe's right.
[2:55:46.960 --> 2:55:48.400]  It's the original Google.
[2:55:48.400 --> 2:55:49.400]  Absolutely.
[2:55:49.400 --> 2:55:54.120]  It's the method you're confessing to it, Joe.
[2:55:54.120 --> 2:55:55.120]  That's right.
[2:55:55.120 --> 2:55:57.920]  I've been whistling the same tune for many years.
[2:55:57.920 --> 2:56:01.800]  I mean, the first, one of the first things you do as a special agent was to order up
[2:56:01.800 --> 2:56:05.440]  all the tax returns from the people that, you know, and filed.
[2:56:05.440 --> 2:56:08.400]  And you've got all this information that they voluntarily gave you.
[2:56:08.400 --> 2:56:12.840]  And I'm not, I realize, you know, it's, it's intimidation, it's force.
[2:56:12.840 --> 2:56:16.560]  But you know, they, they volunteered all this information to you.
[2:56:16.560 --> 2:56:21.360]  And that, you know, that was back in 1993 to 1999.
[2:56:21.360 --> 2:56:23.600]  So imagine what they have today.
[2:56:23.600 --> 2:56:27.320]  And of course you've probably heard of FinCEN, F-I-M-C-E-N.
[2:56:27.320 --> 2:56:28.840]  Financial crimes enforcement.
[2:56:28.840 --> 2:56:29.840]  Yeah.
[2:56:29.840 --> 2:56:34.840]  Have, have people, have your listeners Google FinCEN to see, you know, where we stand today.
[2:56:34.840 --> 2:56:39.680]  Well, since you mentioned that, they use FinCEN outside of law to just, the Southern
[2:56:39.680 --> 2:56:40.920]  Private Law Center says you're hateful.
[2:56:40.920 --> 2:56:45.000]  You're going to have an A plus plus, no criminal record, perfect credit with banks.
[2:56:45.000 --> 2:56:48.960]  Suddenly, your bank accounts, because they put in FinCEN, hate.
[2:56:48.960 --> 2:56:52.800]  Well, precisely, you can add to that, the Michael Avenatti story.
[2:56:52.800 --> 2:56:55.200]  So some high-ranking IRS official connected to FinCEN.
[2:56:55.200 --> 2:56:58.240]  By the way, you said this months ago, it's confirmed they raided the guy.
[2:56:58.240 --> 2:56:59.240]  He gave it to Avenatti.
[2:56:59.240 --> 2:57:00.240]  Exactly.
[2:57:00.240 --> 2:57:01.240]  What happened to you?
[2:57:01.240 --> 2:57:04.960]  The high-ranking IRS agent was using access to FinCEN records to disclose all the private
[2:57:04.960 --> 2:57:07.880]  bank records of even the wrong Michael Cohen.
[2:57:07.880 --> 2:57:09.920]  And so that's the power they have.
[2:57:09.920 --> 2:57:13.000]  And so when they can leak that information, they can destroy your life overnight.
[2:57:13.000 --> 2:57:16.640]  Why is, why are the Democratic Party obsessed with President Trump's tax returns?
[2:57:16.640 --> 2:57:18.560]  Not because they think there's anything wrong on those returns.
[2:57:18.560 --> 2:57:20.200]  They want to find out his intimates.
[2:57:20.200 --> 2:57:21.200]  Exactly.
[2:57:21.200 --> 2:57:24.240]  Every little private piece of his life over the past 20 years.
[2:57:24.240 --> 2:57:25.240]  That's what they are.
[2:57:25.240 --> 2:57:27.400]  They're an infre... they're the stasi in disguise.
[2:57:27.400 --> 2:57:30.320]  And Joe's been one of the leaders at outing them for the last 20 years.
[2:57:30.320 --> 2:57:31.320]  Oh, Joe's right.
[2:57:31.320 --> 2:57:32.520]  It's the heart of the deep state.
[2:57:32.520 --> 2:57:33.520]  Correct.
[2:57:33.520 --> 2:57:34.520]  It's the nexus point.
[2:57:34.520 --> 2:57:38.000]  Let's... and it gives them legal cover to do it, because Google and Facebook and Twitter
[2:57:38.000 --> 2:57:39.000]  don't have it yet.
[2:57:39.000 --> 2:57:41.520]  We'll be right back on the side with your phone calls.
[2:57:41.520 --> 2:57:43.520]  I promise, straight ahead, stay with us.
[2:58:11.520 --> 2:58:20.240]  We have developed, hands down from our research, the most powerful, healthy energy drink, pre-workout
[2:58:20.240 --> 2:58:23.080]  and beyond system in the world.
[2:58:23.080 --> 2:58:25.480]  There's nothing else like it, you must experience it.
[2:58:25.480 --> 2:58:30.080]  It is a total game changer and it comes in easy to use, packaged, mixed in with fruit
[2:58:30.080 --> 2:58:32.720]  juice or water, whatever you'd like.
[2:58:32.720 --> 2:58:34.040]  Warning though, it's very, very strong.
[2:58:34.040 --> 2:58:38.480]  It lasts up to 10 hours, so take a half packet the first time you take it, because TurboForce
[2:58:38.480 --> 2:58:43.760]  is named TurboForce because it will take you into overdrive, TurboForce at M4sLife.com.
[2:59:38.480 --> 2:59:48.880]  We are the Renaissance and we are winning.
[2:59:48.880 --> 2:59:59.880]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[2:59:59.880 --> 3:00:10.280]  I'm going to show you how it will be.
[3:00:10.280 --> 3:00:23.800]  There's one for you, nineteen for me.
[3:00:23.800 --> 3:00:38.400]  Look at these headlines, AP News, Trump Junior feds using Stalinist tactics against his family.
[3:00:38.400 --> 3:00:39.400]  They absolutely are.
[3:00:39.400 --> 3:00:44.720]  There's a store on InfoWars.com where there's a nice lady, a pastry maker that's worked
[3:00:44.720 --> 3:00:51.120]  at Marlago for years and they found out that she's a Trump supporter and they found out
[3:00:51.120 --> 3:00:54.920]  that she's into QAnon conspiracy, well that's her right, so now they want her fired.
[3:00:54.920 --> 3:00:57.560]  I mean, that's the level.
[3:00:57.560 --> 3:01:04.240]  So Joe Bannister, it seems like they're just conditioning us to be persecuted and bullied
[3:01:04.240 --> 3:01:07.800]  by Big Tech, the IRS and the rest of it.
[3:01:07.800 --> 3:01:12.000]  Yeah, including the President of the United States and that's why I like to take this
[3:01:12.000 --> 3:01:19.840]  opportunity to just let President Trump know that I can, I know at least a couple dozen
[3:01:19.840 --> 3:01:21.440]  attorneys and experts.
[3:01:21.440 --> 3:01:25.720]  Hold on, I'm not interrupting you, but let's take a call because I want to drumbeat this
[3:01:25.720 --> 3:01:26.720]  up.
[3:01:26.720 --> 3:01:31.240]  Your message to the President, former Treasury agent, great patriot, found not guilty in
[3:01:31.240 --> 3:01:32.240]  two show trials.
[3:01:32.240 --> 3:01:35.920]  When we come back from break, it'll be your message to the President and I have a sneaky
[3:01:35.920 --> 3:01:38.120]  suspicion we might be able to get it to him.
[3:01:38.120 --> 3:01:41.480]  Carlos in Montreal, Canada, you're on the air, go ahead.
[3:01:41.480 --> 3:01:42.480]  Thank you, Alex.
[3:01:42.480 --> 3:01:43.480]  Thank you, Alex.
[3:01:43.480 --> 3:01:46.640]  It dovetails perfectly with what I was going to say.
[3:01:46.640 --> 3:01:53.880]  The Federal Reserve is effectively taking out $500 billion, as it did last year, from
[3:01:53.880 --> 3:01:56.640]  the currency, from liquidity.
[3:01:56.640 --> 3:01:57.640]  It's not helping.
[3:01:57.640 --> 3:02:05.720]  It was an instrument in 1913 that introduced banquerism over capitalism, where people
[3:02:05.720 --> 3:02:11.840]  didn't have to longer justify their credit on work, but basically it was printed out
[3:02:11.840 --> 3:02:12.840]  of thin air.
[3:02:12.840 --> 3:02:17.320]  When you have a situation like that, you have the same thing that happened in Venezuela
[3:02:17.320 --> 3:02:23.280]  in the 60s, when the people revolted against the central banking, making a few oligarchs
[3:02:23.280 --> 3:02:27.000]  very wealthy, whitish in color because they were European with credit.
[3:02:27.000 --> 3:02:31.960]  Well, the ones who were Indians were left behind to mend the environment that they were
[3:02:31.960 --> 3:02:34.760]  destroying in the oil industry.
[3:02:34.760 --> 3:02:40.760]  When you look at what I call the Chavez revolt, the rebellion of Chavez, it's coming to United
[3:02:40.760 --> 3:02:42.800]  States because it's the same principle.
[3:02:42.800 --> 3:02:47.040]  You have a bunch of oligarchs and the rest of the people are left behind, they're left
[3:02:47.040 --> 3:02:49.520]  behind with very little wealth.
[3:02:49.520 --> 3:02:55.120]  When you have this imbalance in the few and many, what happens is you have the Robin Hood
[3:02:55.120 --> 3:02:56.120]  candidates.
[3:02:56.120 --> 3:03:00.200]  You have candidates like Chavez who come out of basically a bus driver like Maduro, who
[3:03:00.200 --> 3:03:05.360]  basically come forward and offer the public free this, free that, free that because it
[3:03:05.360 --> 3:03:09.320]  is taxation with a representation effectively.
[3:03:09.320 --> 3:03:10.840]  But they've a founding father.
[3:03:10.840 --> 3:03:15.800]  Exactly, we better offer real jobs and real capitalism because either fascism or communism
[3:03:15.800 --> 3:03:21.520]  or socialism will produce a bunch of AOCs coming in, promising people free lunches,
[3:03:21.520 --> 3:03:24.360]  and then this nightmare starts.
[3:03:24.360 --> 3:03:29.720]  And there's a number one, Robin Hood, and number two is the elements that follow.
[3:03:29.720 --> 3:03:33.480]  And you know, by telling blacks that you're going to give them reparations for the very
[3:03:33.480 --> 3:03:38.320]  many years of slavery, basically you're doing what Chavez was saying to the poor, hey, forever
[3:03:38.320 --> 3:03:42.640]  reparations for many years of poverty, you know, vote for me and you will have Robin
[3:03:42.640 --> 3:03:45.920]  Hood candidate and you know, the world's your an oyster.
[3:03:45.920 --> 3:03:50.680]  And of course, those who were with credit who had oil companies that they invested in,
[3:03:50.680 --> 3:03:54.360]  those people were saying, hey, hey, listen, we put our money, our work at everything,
[3:03:54.360 --> 3:03:59.280]  but what if these people with no credit, you see, the Federal Reserve creates people with
[3:03:59.280 --> 3:04:04.120]  credit and gives them, you know, internal money, but the people with no credit, obviously
[3:04:04.120 --> 3:04:07.560]  the bankers, bankeurism doesn't give poor people money.
[3:04:07.560 --> 3:04:12.000]  So what happens is that effectively, the poor get poorer and the rich get richer, any new
[3:04:12.000 --> 3:04:13.000]  money.
[3:04:13.000 --> 3:04:14.000]  No, exactly.
[3:04:14.000 --> 3:04:17.400]  It's a predatory system where they promise them pie in the sky and they use the fact
[3:04:17.400 --> 3:04:21.640]  that real free market folks don't recognize this and block it to take over.
[3:04:21.640 --> 3:04:22.640]  Carlos, amazing points.
[3:04:22.640 --> 3:04:27.920]  We're going to come back and we're going to have Joe Bannister's message to the president.
[3:04:27.920 --> 3:04:31.040]  And then I want to get your message to the president because a lot of these messages
[3:04:31.040 --> 3:04:34.840]  to the president, they love it when we say this, it somehow gets to Trump.
[3:04:34.840 --> 3:04:38.400]  So we'll have Joe give a three minute message to the president, we'll have you give one
[3:04:38.400 --> 3:04:41.000]  and we'll take a few calls straight ahead.
[3:04:41.000 --> 3:04:47.120]  I'm Alex Jones, infowars.com, newswars.com, tomorrow's news today.
[3:04:47.120 --> 3:04:48.440]  What is it about this broadcast?
[3:04:48.440 --> 3:04:54.240]  They fight so hard to shut it down.

[3:05:48.920 --> 3:06:00.680]  at InfowarsStore.com.
[3:06:00.680 --> 3:06:10.680]  Waging war on corruption, it's Alex Jones.
[3:06:10.680 --> 3:06:19.880]  We're the bravest, full of grimace and a terrible sound, he pulls the spinning hight
[3:06:19.880 --> 3:06:31.120]  ten to a mile down, helpless people are stuck with dreams, scream like I had as he looks
[3:06:31.120 --> 3:06:32.120]  in on them.
[3:06:32.120 --> 3:06:51.160]  Robert Barnes and Joe Manister are just coming up, Owen Benjamin takes over, had a bunch
[3:06:51.160 --> 3:06:56.080]  of calls to get to him, trying my best to get to him, but Joe Manister, former treasury
[3:06:56.080 --> 3:07:00.840]  agent, whistleblower, tried to put him in prison twice for his free speech with the
[3:07:00.840 --> 3:07:05.360]  private fellow reserve, the IRS corruption, he's here and he's got a message to President
[3:07:05.360 --> 3:07:06.360]  Trump.
[3:07:06.360 --> 3:07:08.640]  So Joe, give President Trump that message.
[3:07:08.640 --> 3:07:13.400]  Well, I feel a little awkward in thinking that any message that I could give would
[3:07:13.400 --> 3:07:19.800]  be worthy of the President's ears, but here goes, I just hope that President Trump realizes
[3:07:19.800 --> 3:07:27.120]  that he's done amazing things, but please don't leave us with a leaky lifeboat when
[3:07:27.120 --> 3:07:30.000]  you finally have to leave office.
[3:07:30.000 --> 3:07:35.520]  Please build us a battleship so that we can continue the fight.
[3:07:35.520 --> 3:07:42.000]  And I can, I know of at least a couple dozen attorneys and experts who can show him where
[3:07:42.000 --> 3:07:45.520]  all the bodies are buried at the IRS.
[3:07:45.520 --> 3:07:48.280]  So just would love the opportunity.
[3:07:48.280 --> 3:07:53.720]  I know he's got a long priority list and that's my, that's my short and sweet message.
[3:07:53.720 --> 3:08:00.080]  But, but, but I mean specifically, Loris Lerner got caught, the MSNBC and others bragged, oh,
[3:08:00.080 --> 3:08:01.080]  yeah, we're targeting conservatives.
[3:08:01.080 --> 3:08:06.280]  This is way beyond anything Nixon ever dreamed of, so I think one of Trump's biggest failures
[3:08:06.280 --> 3:08:11.080]  is not going after the IRS and, and, and I know he's got a lot of things going on, but
[3:08:11.080 --> 3:08:12.080]  Oh, absolutely.
[3:08:12.080 --> 3:08:17.840]  And one of the things he has to do is not have the IRS allowed to be able to control
[3:08:17.840 --> 3:08:19.560]  people's medical records.
[3:08:19.560 --> 3:08:22.640]  So years ago, I brought one of the biggest class actions in the country that disclosed
[3:08:22.640 --> 3:08:26.920]  that the IRS was gathering people's medical records, over 60 million medical records
[3:08:26.920 --> 3:08:28.880]  of over 10 million Americans.
[3:08:28.880 --> 3:08:33.920]  This included medical records of judges, baseball players, the screen actors guild, the directors
[3:08:33.920 --> 3:08:36.120]  guild, some of the most high-profile people in the show.
[3:08:36.120 --> 3:08:40.120]  So they know if you've got HIV, they know if you've got a heart problem.
[3:08:40.120 --> 3:08:44.360]  They know if your kids in drug rehab, they know if your wife has a certain issue.
[3:08:44.360 --> 3:08:47.560]  They know if you're a baseball player, you have an undisclosed medical ailment, or maybe
[3:08:47.560 --> 3:08:51.720]  you're a prominent Hollywood actor who has medical conditions that would make you unbondable
[3:08:51.720 --> 3:08:54.120]  for films and thus uncastable.
[3:08:54.120 --> 3:08:58.120]  So they know, I mean, it's, it would be Hoover's wet dream of a black male file is what the
[3:08:58.120 --> 3:08:59.640]  IRS is gathering on every single day.
[3:08:59.640 --> 3:09:02.120]  And Obama did that how many years ago?
[3:09:02.120 --> 3:09:03.480]  It started eight years ago.
[3:09:03.480 --> 3:09:07.000]  And so what Joe is talking about, I mean, how the, in the world, did they get away with
[3:09:07.000 --> 3:09:08.000]  the IRS?
[3:09:08.000 --> 3:09:09.000]  I remember that.
[3:09:09.000 --> 3:09:10.840]  Oh, the IRS is now over your medical records.
[3:09:10.840 --> 3:09:11.840]  What?
[3:09:11.840 --> 3:09:12.840]  Exactly.
[3:09:12.840 --> 3:09:15.200]  I mean, in my suit, they folded completely because they didn't want the, it did to go
[3:09:15.200 --> 3:09:16.200]  to trial.
[3:09:16.200 --> 3:09:19.520]  So they deleted all records, destroyed all records, made certain specific promises to
[3:09:19.520 --> 3:09:20.600]  my clients.
[3:09:20.600 --> 3:09:22.860]  But that doesn't mean they're not doing it to everybody else.
[3:09:22.860 --> 3:09:26.400]  And so what Joe is talking about is critical, necessary and essential.
[3:09:26.400 --> 3:09:30.000]  And Joe's been in the leader of that and has taken a lot of hits for that.
[3:09:30.000 --> 3:09:33.560]  So that's why, you know, I think people supporting Joe is critical and essential because he's
[3:09:33.560 --> 3:09:37.800]  been a sacrificial lamb and a martyr for a cause that mostly benefits all the rest of
[3:09:37.800 --> 3:09:38.800]  us.
[3:09:38.800 --> 3:09:39.800]  Well, you're right.
[3:09:39.800 --> 3:09:42.840]  He was a patient zero because that was one of the first times, oh, we're going to indict
[3:09:42.840 --> 3:09:46.520]  you because you're a former treasury agent doing radio interviews.
[3:09:46.520 --> 3:09:50.120]  It was like in the indictment saying that it could be a fraud.
[3:09:50.120 --> 3:09:51.120]  Absolutely.
[3:09:51.120 --> 3:09:55.040]  And what happened in that case was Joe was indicted for using the IRS's own rules, the
[3:09:55.040 --> 3:10:00.240]  IRS's own procedures, the IRS's own protocols, following them to a tee, even found a special
[3:10:00.240 --> 3:10:03.360]  form that red flagged the position he was taking.
[3:10:03.360 --> 3:10:05.760]  So just, he just wanted an honest answer for his client.
[3:10:05.760 --> 3:10:06.760]  That's it.
[3:10:06.760 --> 3:10:09.240]  But what used to be the American way of advocacy, used to be...
[3:10:09.240 --> 3:10:13.040]  Well, it's like, meanwhile, Smollett just got caught staging all this, Joe.
[3:10:13.040 --> 3:10:14.840]  We have all these false flags.
[3:10:14.840 --> 3:10:15.840]  They lied to that.
[3:10:15.840 --> 3:10:16.840]  I ever said it was completely fake.
[3:10:16.840 --> 3:10:17.840]  I looked at both sides.
[3:10:17.840 --> 3:10:19.840]  I have a right to say Sandy Hook didn't happen.
[3:10:19.840 --> 3:10:20.840]  Later I looked at them.
[3:10:20.840 --> 3:10:21.840]  I said, yes, match it.
[3:10:21.840 --> 3:10:22.840]  That probably happened.
[3:10:22.840 --> 3:10:26.120]  The point is, is their idea is to take me off the air because I questioned it, which
[3:10:26.120 --> 3:10:30.680]  they admit they want to get rid of New York Times versus Sullivan and in the First Amendment.
[3:10:30.680 --> 3:10:34.360]  Clarence Thomas, God bless him, wrote a big piece last week saying, get rid of the First
[3:10:34.360 --> 3:10:35.360]  Amendment basically.
[3:10:35.360 --> 3:10:36.360]  Oh, exactly.
[3:10:36.360 --> 3:10:38.680]  And it's designed to suppress independent speech.
[3:10:38.680 --> 3:10:41.200]  They never expected Donald Trump to get elected.
[3:10:41.200 --> 3:10:47.040]  They now realize the true scope and pervasiveness of the power of independent, honest voices
[3:10:47.040 --> 3:10:48.040]  like Joe.
[3:10:48.040 --> 3:10:49.400]  Well, let me raise that to Joe.
[3:10:49.400 --> 3:10:55.400]  How big is it, though, that most of the women have admitted they made up the sexual assaults
[3:10:55.400 --> 3:10:57.400]  on Cabinon?
[3:10:57.400 --> 3:10:59.680]  The Covington kids, that was staged.
[3:10:59.680 --> 3:11:00.680]  Smollett staged.
[3:11:00.680 --> 3:11:01.680]  People are really getting now.
[3:11:01.680 --> 3:11:03.240]  I get a lot of apologies in the street.
[3:11:03.240 --> 3:11:04.240]  Wow.
[3:11:04.240 --> 3:11:05.600]  I see why you questioned things.
[3:11:05.600 --> 3:11:07.040]  And now we burst broke last week.
[3:11:07.040 --> 3:11:11.280]  The FBI is looking at people handling Smollett, telling them what to say.
[3:11:11.280 --> 3:11:17.040]  Now it's come out that the heads of the show had put out scripts of what they wanted to
[3:11:17.040 --> 3:11:18.040]  happen.
[3:11:18.040 --> 3:11:21.600]  Smollett may have got hoax attack plot from Empire creators Instagram.
[3:11:21.600 --> 3:11:27.160]  Well, that's what I was told that they're looking at the creators and others because
[3:11:27.160 --> 3:11:30.880]  they had given him scenarios they wanted to see for a raise.
[3:11:30.880 --> 3:11:32.400]  We broke that last Friday.
[3:11:32.400 --> 3:11:34.160]  This is in the news today.
[3:11:34.160 --> 3:11:41.720]  Well, as I say on my website, you know, a lie needs another lie in order to stand.
[3:11:41.720 --> 3:11:44.520]  But the truth stands by itself.
[3:11:44.520 --> 3:11:51.360]  And of course, the paper trail always kills these, these liars and their lives.
[3:11:51.360 --> 3:11:55.960]  And so I just encourage people to learn how to follow the paper trail.
[3:11:55.960 --> 3:11:58.600]  The best place to get that education is infowars.com.
[3:11:58.600 --> 3:11:59.600]  No, no, no.
[3:11:59.600 --> 3:12:02.600]  How do people, because your website's awesome, it's kind of long your own short one.
[3:12:02.600 --> 3:12:04.600]  How do people best find your website and find the book?
[3:12:04.600 --> 3:12:05.600]  They can buy it for me.
[3:12:05.600 --> 3:12:06.600]  They should buy it for me.
[3:12:06.600 --> 3:12:07.600]  I don't care either way.
[3:12:07.600 --> 3:12:10.000]  How do people find your great work, Jeff?
[3:12:10.000 --> 3:12:11.800]  Agent for truth.com.
[3:12:11.800 --> 3:12:15.280]  What's that all about is a great section to get started on.
[3:12:15.280 --> 3:12:16.280]  All right.
[3:12:16.280 --> 3:12:17.280]  Agent for truth.com.
[3:12:17.280 --> 3:12:21.600]  But you just, you just had a key point there.
[3:12:21.600 --> 3:12:25.720]  Why does the establishment, because I was always, always watch old movies where the
[3:12:25.720 --> 3:12:30.000]  villain brags and I think that's dumb, but it's true criminology.
[3:12:30.000 --> 3:12:31.760]  Villains love to tell you what they've done.
[3:12:31.760 --> 3:12:34.080]  They love to brag about it and look at the globalists.
[3:12:34.080 --> 3:12:36.240]  They've told us everything they're doing, Joe.
[3:12:36.240 --> 3:12:41.840]  Well, and as I mentioned before, you know, our founders put together an amazing framework
[3:12:41.840 --> 3:12:45.800]  unseen in human history.
[3:12:45.800 --> 3:12:50.140]  And so there are things like the Freedom of Information Act and our own constitutional
[3:12:50.140 --> 3:12:51.140]  protections.
[3:12:51.140 --> 3:12:56.000]  I mean, I lament about how corrupt our government is, but if it wasn't for my right to a jury
[3:12:56.000 --> 3:13:00.600]  trial, you know, I wouldn't, I wouldn't, I would have spent quite a few years in club
[3:13:00.600 --> 3:13:01.600]  fed.
[3:13:01.600 --> 3:13:03.720]  So we do still have rights.
[3:13:03.720 --> 3:13:09.600]  We just need to exercise them as, as frequently as possible and we can do amazing things.
[3:13:09.600 --> 3:13:14.040]  When they didn't get the convictions, you were tried twice, right?
[3:13:14.040 --> 3:13:18.320]  The second one was a criminal investigation that they terminated, which there's more information
[3:13:18.320 --> 3:13:22.720]  about that in the investigating the federal income tax book.
[3:13:22.720 --> 3:13:28.560]  But yeah, it's been nonstop, just kind of another full time job for me.
[3:13:28.560 --> 3:13:34.760]  But you know, again, the truth, the truth always comes out and deceivers get found out.
[3:13:34.760 --> 3:13:41.120]  And so I, it's my position that the IRS and the DOJ are deceivers and people say that
[3:13:41.120 --> 3:13:44.680]  I am, and I just invite people to look at both.
[3:13:44.680 --> 3:13:45.680]  Don't forget.
[3:13:45.680 --> 3:13:51.960]  How would you draw your career that was rising just to challenge all this unless you do it?
[3:13:51.960 --> 3:13:56.200]  Don't forget that America freedom to fascism is a great educational tool, right?
[3:13:56.200 --> 3:13:57.200]  Right, Alex?
[3:13:57.200 --> 3:13:58.720]  You did a great job in that film.
[3:13:58.720 --> 3:14:03.880]  Well, Joe, come back soon the next few weeks, do a whole hour and take calls on the IRS
[3:14:03.880 --> 3:14:04.880]  and what's happening.
[3:14:04.880 --> 3:14:05.880]  God bless you.
[3:14:05.880 --> 3:14:08.000]  The book is available at agentfortruth.com.
[3:14:08.000 --> 3:14:12.600]  We have an m4store.com investigating the federal income tax that reports the American
[3:14:12.600 --> 3:14:16.360]  people, Joseph R. Bannister, former IRS special agent.
[3:14:16.360 --> 3:14:17.360]  God bless you.
[3:14:17.360 --> 3:14:20.120]  Thank you, Alex.
[3:14:20.120 --> 3:14:24.480]  We've got a really smart, funny guy, Owen Benjamin, about to take over, but I promised
[3:14:24.480 --> 3:14:25.480]  I'd take all these calls.
[3:14:25.480 --> 3:14:30.000]  And, and Owen knows sometimes that I'll preempt when he's on, but I just saw a few of these
[3:14:30.000 --> 3:14:31.000]  calls.
[3:14:31.000 --> 3:14:35.080]  I can't get to everybody, but my gosh, Josh has been holding for almost two hours and
[3:14:35.080 --> 3:14:36.080]  so has Grant.
[3:14:36.080 --> 3:14:38.960]  So I'm sure Owen Benjamin is going to be okay.
[3:14:38.960 --> 3:14:42.080]  We're going to come back, hit two calls with you and then throw it to him.
[3:14:42.080 --> 3:14:43.080]  Everybody else.
[3:14:43.080 --> 3:14:44.080]  I apologize.
[3:14:44.080 --> 3:14:45.080]  I can't get to you.
[3:14:45.080 --> 3:14:46.080]  Mitchell and freedom fighter.
[3:14:46.080 --> 3:14:48.280]  The problem is we have like 20 phone lines.
[3:14:48.280 --> 3:14:51.920]  So we take like 10 calls, the rest fill up and I always feel bad hanging up on them.
[3:14:51.920 --> 3:14:52.920]  So it's kind of a catch.
[3:14:52.920 --> 3:14:57.560]  But we'll hit two of those and then Owen Benjamin was going to take over.
[3:14:57.560 --> 3:14:58.560]  Huge pianist.
[3:14:58.560 --> 3:14:59.560]  That means piano.
[3:14:59.560 --> 3:15:00.560]  Huge pianist.
[3:15:00.560 --> 3:15:03.720]  He was like six, eight.
[3:15:03.720 --> 3:15:05.120]  He's almost as tall as I am.
[3:15:05.120 --> 3:15:06.120]  I'm joking.
[3:15:06.120 --> 3:15:08.120]  He's almost as tall as our friend in Connecticut.
[3:15:08.120 --> 3:15:09.760]  So, so, so that's all coming up.
[3:15:09.760 --> 3:15:15.880]  But just listening to Joe, Robert Barnes turning it law, it's just crazy that he barely survived
[3:15:15.880 --> 3:15:16.880]  when the guy did nothing.
[3:15:16.880 --> 3:15:17.880]  Absolutely.
[3:15:17.880 --> 3:15:21.060]  I mean, this was one of the most honest, one of the most sincere people that I've ever
[3:15:21.060 --> 3:15:25.480]  met in my entire 20 years of doing this kind of legal work in these kind of cases.
[3:15:25.480 --> 3:15:28.240]  He's an extraordinary human being, a generous human being.
[3:15:28.240 --> 3:15:29.400]  He was generous with his time.
[3:15:29.400 --> 3:15:32.800]  He was generous with the risk he took for everybody else's freedom and liberty.
[3:15:32.800 --> 3:15:36.840]  He did so for their freedom and their liberty because he's one of the last true patriots.
[3:15:36.840 --> 3:15:41.480]  Most of his family members are law enforcement, but they're fire, they're fire department
[3:15:41.480 --> 3:15:43.280]  guys, they're police officers.
[3:15:43.280 --> 3:15:46.920]  He believed in the American dream and he still believed in the American dream even when the
[3:15:46.920 --> 3:15:50.600]  corrupt actors in our politicized system of justice tried to crush that American dream.
[3:15:50.600 --> 3:15:51.600]  That's right.
[3:15:51.600 --> 3:15:52.600]  We'll be back.
[3:15:52.600 --> 3:15:57.080]  Pain in my neck, back and shoulders has really gotten worse.

[3:19:50.380 --> 3:20:10.300]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[3:20:10.300 --> 3:20:14.860]  Well, one of my favorite comedians and talk show host, Owen Benjamin, is about to take
[3:20:14.860 --> 3:20:18.380]  over, and I apologize for hijacking some of his time, but he's welcome anytime to come
[3:20:18.380 --> 3:20:22.260]  and go. He's coming up and just heard a few minutes, but I promised Josh and Grant. Yeah,
[3:20:22.260 --> 3:20:26.940]  there's Owen Benjamin right there. I promised Grant and Josh we'd go to him. So Josh and
[3:20:26.940 --> 3:20:31.140]  Indiana, go ahead. You're on the air with Alex Jones and Robert Barnes.
[3:20:31.140 --> 3:20:35.380]  Alex Jones of the modern day, Paul Revere. What an honor to speak with you, sir.
[3:20:35.380 --> 3:20:38.140]  Honored to take the youth, and thanks for holding so long.
[3:20:38.140 --> 3:20:46.700]  Well, I called in about Venezuela, and I don't agree about getting involved in it. As you
[3:20:46.700 --> 3:20:58.900]  guys clearly pointed out, I think, with Mr. Banister and Mr. Barnes, we got to help you.
[3:20:58.900 --> 3:21:08.060]  We got to get together and, you know, support InfoWars. I mean, that's, you're bringing
[3:21:08.060 --> 3:21:15.060]  all this for everybody to listen to, and it just hurts my heart to see all this evil
[3:21:15.060 --> 3:21:19.140]  in the world. We got to support InfoWars.
[3:21:19.140 --> 3:21:22.500]  Well, I appreciate it, but you know, if we weren't effective, they wouldn't be trying
[3:21:22.500 --> 3:21:26.540]  that. But no, I hear you. I don't like Maduro or what's happening, but I don't trust the
[3:21:26.540 --> 3:21:28.780]  neocons in our own government to not make it worse.
[3:21:28.780 --> 3:21:32.900]  Oh, precisely. There's just a long history of our direct involvement contaminating things.
[3:21:32.900 --> 3:21:36.700]  There's already people on the ground who believe that, in fact, Maduro's gotten a second life
[3:21:36.700 --> 3:21:41.100]  because of our such public affiliation with challenging him, where he was probably on...
[3:21:41.100 --> 3:21:44.140]  Well, one argument is they sold us out the Ironman from World Bank, and we're really propping
[3:21:44.140 --> 3:21:45.140]  Maduro up.
[3:21:45.140 --> 3:21:47.980]  Yeah, exactly. There's that problem as well. And then there's the issues of doubts about
[3:21:47.980 --> 3:21:52.020]  his supposed replacement. So there's a lot of issues. I think the less direct... Let
[3:21:52.020 --> 3:21:55.580]  the people of Venezuela and give them the support necessary, but only let the people
[3:21:55.580 --> 3:21:58.460]  of Venezuela make their own decision to determine their own future.
[3:21:58.460 --> 3:22:02.300]  But what do we do about Russians and Chinese coming in? I don't like that, either.
[3:22:02.300 --> 3:22:05.540]  But what that really does is it elevates. They are a proxy for China, and there's a
[3:22:05.540 --> 3:22:09.940]  whole lot of problems with Venezuela, independent of their economic collapse. But the other
[3:22:09.940 --> 3:22:15.060]  part of that is, do we want to escalate conflict with Russia? This is where Mueller's bogus
[3:22:15.060 --> 3:22:21.860]  probe and the media's manic conspiracy theory fantasy of Russia collusion-delusion has led
[3:22:21.860 --> 3:22:22.860]  to major problems.
[3:22:22.860 --> 3:22:24.860]  Because Trump has escalated stuff with Russia.
[3:22:24.860 --> 3:22:25.860]  Correct.
[3:22:25.860 --> 3:22:30.020]  To show he's not a Rusky. It's crazy. And that's what I'm concerned about. But Josh,
[3:22:30.020 --> 3:22:33.700]  thanks for the support. God bless you. But you did have something to say about Venezuela.
[3:22:33.700 --> 3:22:37.300]  Oh, he's gone. God bless you. I wanted to hear what he had to say. Grant, real quick.
[3:22:37.300 --> 3:22:44.500]  And Owen Benjamin, who is a very famous comedian, he's also a little person. Like Hank Johnson
[3:22:44.500 --> 3:22:49.580]  says, you don't call him midgets. He's a little person. He's two foot four. But he's
[3:22:49.580 --> 3:22:54.100]  got the heart of a lion. That's why he always has a fisheye lens, very close to his face
[3:22:54.100 --> 3:22:59.220]  to look big. So he's a little jealous of my height. You know, I'm five-two. He's a little
[3:22:59.220 --> 3:23:04.940]  jealous. So Owen's taking over. Owen, I'm sorry to bring up your height. I apologize.
[3:23:04.940 --> 3:23:08.180]  Real fast, though. Grant in Iowa. You're on the air. Go ahead. Last caller.
[3:23:08.180 --> 3:23:14.220]  Grant from Iowa. Yeah. You guys have traversed a plethora of topics since I called in. But
[3:23:14.220 --> 3:23:18.820]  pretty crazy timing with Putin issuing the nuclear threats while Maduro is supposedly
[3:23:18.820 --> 3:23:25.620]  burning trucks of aid. And then the other thing I wanted to throw in is the North Koreans.
[3:23:25.620 --> 3:23:30.500]  You guys had the story on the North Koreans denouncing the Democrats for trying to sabotage
[3:23:30.500 --> 3:23:36.340]  the peace talks, which is kind of crazy when you've got a communist North Korean even siding
[3:23:36.340 --> 3:23:40.940]  against the far left Democrat Party in America. By the way, I meant Sunday. That'd be my
[3:23:40.940 --> 3:23:46.580]  lead story. Like Twilight Zone is here. North Korea decries the Democrats. Exactly. Amazing.
[3:23:46.580 --> 3:23:49.220]  I mean, here you have the president of the United States trying to achieve the greatest
[3:23:49.220 --> 3:23:53.020]  peace involving the greatest nuclear threat in the modern world today. And what's happening,
[3:23:53.020 --> 3:23:56.700]  the Democratic Party, the purported peace party is the one trying to undermine it. Now,
[3:23:56.700 --> 3:24:00.340]  if you study the Democratic Party historically, the Democratic Party is the war party. The
[3:24:00.340 --> 3:24:04.900]  quote, old Bob Dole back in the 90s. Exactly. Now, you go all the way back almost every
[3:24:04.900 --> 3:24:08.820]  war was started by a Democrat. It was often someone else who wasn't a Democrat who stopped
[3:24:08.820 --> 3:24:14.540]  Vietnam, who ended World War, who it was the Democrats who got us into World War One, World
[3:24:14.540 --> 3:24:18.980]  War Two, Korea. They were over the Civil Rights Act anyway. Exactly. So Koreans denouncing
[3:24:18.980 --> 3:24:24.180]  Democrats, what do you make of that? I mean, it's just out. Like you said, it's upside
[3:24:24.180 --> 3:24:29.060]  down world. It just goes along with everything else is backwards right now. The other thing
[3:24:29.060 --> 3:24:32.500]  I wanted to point out that you might have missed this weekend, Jesse Waters nominated
[3:24:32.500 --> 3:24:37.420]  you for the best fight with little bathhouse Marco there. I thought that was pretty hilarious.
[3:24:37.420 --> 3:24:42.060]  I was cheering you on, but they gave it to Trump. He gave the award to Trump for the
[3:24:42.060 --> 3:24:48.260]  I miss, I miss Fox News. What did Jesse Waters say? It was he just did like a little Waters
[3:24:48.260 --> 3:24:53.060]  award, you know, version of the Emmys for political Emmys and he nominated you for best
[3:24:53.060 --> 3:24:59.580]  fight. And but he gave it to Trump with the cost of things. So no, I think Trump deserves
[3:24:59.580 --> 3:25:03.100]  it. I didn't know about that, but we'll do it. God bless you, Grant. Thanks for holding.
[3:25:03.100 --> 3:25:07.540]  I apologize to Owen Benjamin and even mentioning Kim Jong-un in front of him, because like
[3:25:07.540 --> 3:25:14.180]  Kim Jong-un is like twice as tall as on Benjamin. So Owen gets really upset about that. So
[3:25:14.180 --> 3:25:20.100]  being sarcastic. Hey, Owen, thank you for being here. Tell us what's coming up. Well,
[3:25:20.100 --> 3:25:26.340]  we prefer to be called people McNuggets. So that's actually the PC term. Yeah, we're
[3:25:26.340 --> 3:25:30.380]  going to talk about the Oscars and why I didn't watch them. We're going to talk about
[3:25:30.380 --> 3:25:35.700]  a UFC being potentially homoerotic. We're going to talk about vampires, all kinds of
[3:25:35.700 --> 3:25:38.620]  stuff. It's going to be a blast. All right. Take over my friend. Thanks for being here
[3:25:38.620 --> 3:25:46.900]  with us. Nice for having me. What's up, everybody? Hi. I'm honored to be a guest hosting this,
[3:25:46.900 --> 3:25:53.980]  uh, hour of the Alex Jones, uh, show. And last night with the Oscars and everyone was
[3:25:53.980 --> 3:25:58.380]  asking me if I was going to live stream the Oscars and make fun of the Oscars and stuff.
[3:25:58.380 --> 3:26:04.860]  And I don't watch the Oscars because the Oscars are lame. I think that, uh, don't get me wrong.
[3:26:04.860 --> 3:26:11.020]  I've been a part of that many times where I have, uh, live streamed something or just
[3:26:11.020 --> 3:26:18.300]  tweeted before I got kicked off Twitter permanently for being a hilarious. Um, and I realized
[3:26:18.300 --> 3:26:23.580]  I was still engaging in it. And this is something that I'd like you guys to write to me or talk
[3:26:23.580 --> 3:26:29.180]  amongst yourselves on what you think, because as a comedian, I feel like sometimes when
[3:26:29.180 --> 3:26:36.900]  I mock something that I know I hate that isn't going to change, I'm still engaging in it
[3:26:36.900 --> 3:26:42.580]  for long periods of time. I think, uh, watching the Oscars and making fun of it at this point,
[3:26:42.580 --> 3:26:49.460]  um, is almost like watching gay porn to mock it. It's like, Oh, look at how gay these guys
[3:26:49.460 --> 3:26:55.760]  are. Oh, look at them. They're still, they're still being gay. Oh, how disgusting. Another
[3:26:55.760 --> 3:27:01.940]  guy's joining in. Oh, look, two hours deep and they're still being gay. How gross is
[3:27:01.940 --> 3:27:08.780]  that? They're so bad. Like, and, and Hollywood, I used to be an actor in Hollywood and a comedian
[3:27:08.780 --> 3:27:12.380]  in Hollywood. And I was on a sitcom for three years. I've been in a bunch of Adam Sandler
[3:27:12.380 --> 3:27:17.980]  movies. Adam Sandler is a great guy. Um, some, uh, Comedy Central specials have done, you
[3:27:17.980 --> 3:27:25.340]  know, Leno and Fallon and all those shows. So I know that I know what that is. And somewhere
[3:27:25.340 --> 3:27:29.420]  along the way, I guess it's always been this way, but I didn't see it at the time. I think
[3:27:29.420 --> 3:27:35.540]  a lot of us have probably come to these realizations because of just the tightening of the screws,
[3:27:35.540 --> 3:27:41.860]  but it's gotten intolerable to the point where every single speech is just like, I'm here
[3:27:41.860 --> 3:27:48.900]  today to stand up for the people that were oppressed by the white man. I can't, there's
[3:27:48.900 --> 3:27:54.980]  no reason to watch it. And the way these narcissists work. And by the way, uh, a lot of these
[3:27:54.980 --> 3:27:58.940]  communities, quote unquote, not that there is a black community or a gay community that
[3:27:58.940 --> 3:28:06.700]  makes no sense. Communities are geographic. It's not, or based on belief or based on culture.
[3:28:06.700 --> 3:28:11.820]  It's not based on skin color or where you put the wean. Uh, they don't, when you take
[3:28:11.820 --> 3:28:20.420]  these socialists and, um, a lot of these revolutionary types, a lot of the oligarchs, they, they
[3:28:20.420 --> 3:28:25.420]  do some, they, they use something called proxy warriors where they take these, um, these kind
[3:28:25.420 --> 3:28:29.780]  of weakened groups or these groups that are kind of all over the map and they inflate
[3:28:29.780 --> 3:28:35.060]  them to destabilize the society. And you see that with, um, homosexuals and, and black
[3:28:35.060 --> 3:28:40.420]  America. Oh, oh, we'll be back in, oh, we gotta, we gotta take a break here. I was, I was about
[3:28:40.420 --> 3:28:44.780]  to start really crushing some homers. I was about to start really just hitting the body
[3:28:44.780 --> 3:28:48.180]  and then a big hook. Uh, I'll see you guys in a second. And in the meantime, think about
[3:28:48.180 --> 3:28:52.620]  rather not watching something as being a part of it, even if you mock it. Interesting stuff.
[3:28:52.620 --> 3:28:58.580]  Pain in my neck, back and shoulders has really gotten worse. Relief for body pain is here
[3:28:58.580 --> 3:29:02.620]  with Sunny Bay Heating Pads. Well, the last thing I want is to take another pill. So what's

[3:31:53.820 --> 3:31:57.900]  You know, the worst part about getting old and I'm still strong at 45 is that I won't

[3:32:01.660 --> 3:32:06.780]  be there for my children. Now I can make them strong. Now I can instruct them. Now I can

[3:33:16.180 --> 3:33:27.660]  This is Alex Jones with Owen Benjamin. That little hook right there is DJ Shadow Midnight
[3:33:27.660 --> 3:33:33.140]  in the Perfect World. As they were just playing that, it dawned on me that I should do a whole
[3:33:33.140 --> 3:33:40.860]  music episode with you guys one day about the form of music, the logos of music, God's
[3:33:40.860 --> 3:33:48.940]  Word in music, and how it fusion jazz and John Cage and all these destructive forms
[3:33:48.940 --> 3:33:55.940]  of music. We're in an attempt to rewrite the natural order of the universe. It's pretty
[3:33:55.940 --> 3:34:00.380]  fascinating, but I'm going to stand on top of it. We're talking about the Oscars. They're
[3:34:00.380 --> 3:34:09.740]  called proxy warriors. People with real power will build up these smaller kind of, I wouldn't
[3:34:09.740 --> 3:34:15.020]  say fringe, but corruptible groups and they build up their ego and they give them lots
[3:34:15.020 --> 3:34:20.300]  of money and weapons and the weapons can be words or influence and media. And they do
[3:34:20.300 --> 3:34:27.020]  it to keep a society destabilized and to keep the family broken. And then here's the punch
[3:34:27.020 --> 3:34:33.740]  line. A lot of times in history, they then kill those guys. So as you're watching this
[3:34:33.740 --> 3:34:41.620]  increase in LGBTQ AIP and all these additions to this ridiculous satanic alphabet, and as
[3:34:41.620 --> 3:34:48.020]  you watch these Hollywood elites push these agendas and it's all about reparations for
[3:34:48.020 --> 3:34:51.980]  slavery and it's all nonsense. We know it's all nonsense. Those people aren't going to
[3:34:51.980 --> 3:34:59.300]  benefit from it. It's just to destabilize the family. I've had friends that are still
[3:34:59.300 --> 3:35:05.100]  going to these type of events like Oscars and stuff and I'm starting a farm. I have
[3:35:05.100 --> 3:35:09.180]  two children. We're working on a third. I'm out in the country. I'm not connected to that
[3:35:09.180 --> 3:35:14.700]  at all. And it's insane to me when people think that you're jealous of something that
[3:35:14.700 --> 3:35:19.060]  you couldn't, there's no amount of money you would do for. People are like, you're just
[3:35:19.060 --> 3:35:25.340]  jealous that you're not still on a TV show here in LA. That's literally like saying you're
[3:35:25.340 --> 3:35:32.380]  just jealous that you couldn't put a hot poker in your wiener hole. And let that sink in.
[3:35:32.380 --> 3:35:41.740]  Let that sink in how insane that is. To me, the whole LA idol worship and the sodomy lobby
[3:35:41.740 --> 3:35:47.420]  is so horrifying, so soul-sucking and so just, they're all on anxiety pills and depression
[3:35:47.420 --> 3:35:52.140]  pills. Half of them are just, one of my friends just hung himself last week, Brody Stevens,
[3:35:52.140 --> 3:35:59.300]  the comedian, one of the only sane right-wing comedians in LA and he tapped out. I mean,
[3:35:59.300 --> 3:36:05.020]  that's not a healthy environment. It's like, they're like, oh, you're just jealous. You're
[3:36:05.020 --> 3:36:12.340]  just making fun of Joe the Toe Rogan because you're jealous. That's literally like saying
[3:36:12.340 --> 3:36:18.100]  you would do anything to put a hot poker in your wiener hole.
[3:36:18.100 --> 3:36:25.620]  So as I'm thinking about the Oscars, Hollywood is insane. You give up everything and it's
[3:36:25.620 --> 3:36:32.060]  lured through sex mostly, sexual freedom. And that all started with, what was that guy's
[3:36:32.060 --> 3:36:37.620]  name? Foucault and all those guys in the 70s that made that satanic deal where it's like
[3:36:37.620 --> 3:36:44.900]  the left will now no longer focus on economics or ending war or any of that stuff. It's only
[3:36:44.900 --> 3:36:51.900]  about turning your, being allowed to have sexual perversion to destabilize the country.
[3:36:51.900 --> 3:36:56.300]  And Foucault of course died of AIDS in a San Francisco bathhouse because that's how that
[3:36:56.300 --> 3:37:04.540]  rolls. You know, sodomy's no joke, man. Sodomy, the reason sodomy is so powerfully evil is
[3:37:04.540 --> 3:37:09.700]  because it takes that which is fruitful and makes it sterile. The sex act is what gives
[3:37:09.700 --> 3:37:16.100]  you life. And so sodomy is taking that which gives you life and making it sterile, making
[3:37:16.100 --> 3:37:23.980]  it nothing. And in many times, that which gives you debt. It's the same with debt-based
[3:37:23.980 --> 3:37:31.100]  user recurrency. It's taking something dead and making it appear to create. And when it
[3:37:31.100 --> 3:37:36.300]  doesn't, it's same as sodomy. It's taking something that creates and making it dead.
[3:37:36.300 --> 3:37:40.420]  And I'm not one of those people that's like, you're disgusting. Look at you, you sodomite.
[3:37:40.420 --> 3:37:43.820]  You're so disgusting. Those people I think are kind of projecting. I had some priests
[3:37:43.820 --> 3:37:48.220]  growing up that were like that and they were projecting. And so a good way to tell if someone
[3:37:48.220 --> 3:37:53.420]  is actually saying what's real or if they're projecting their own inner demons that they
[3:37:53.420 --> 3:37:58.500]  haven't conquered yet is are they call, are they like really into calling you names about
[3:37:58.500 --> 3:38:04.140]  it? Don't trust those guys. When it's like, look at you, you disgusting. Look at you.
[3:38:04.140 --> 3:38:09.460]  Like those guys are usually hiding a deep secret. That's why I just focus on the act
[3:38:09.460 --> 3:38:15.940]  itself and how gross it is. And the reason it's becoming a real situation is because
[3:38:15.940 --> 3:38:22.020]  they're now making it a brave act. It's one thing if a society tolerates it. It's another
[3:38:22.020 --> 3:38:34.420]  thing if a society elevates it. And the elevation of these, these lifeless acts, it's very similar
[3:38:34.420 --> 3:38:39.340]  to vampires. I know I'm all over the map right now, but, you know, it's, it's info wars.
[3:38:39.340 --> 3:38:42.940]  It's kind of, kind of part of it. That's one reason why I like this, this channel so much
[3:38:42.940 --> 3:38:49.300]  is I'm allowed to just duck and, and throw some haymakers and then back off. Okay. Like
[3:38:49.300 --> 3:38:54.220]  a vampire is the opposite of Jesus Christ, right? So Jesus Christ spills blood to give
[3:38:54.220 --> 3:39:00.340]  life. The vampire takes blood for his eternal life. Like, all right. So Jesus gives his
[3:39:00.340 --> 3:39:06.620]  blood for our eternal life. The vampire takes blood for his eternal life. It's a mathematical
[3:39:06.620 --> 3:39:12.700]  inverse. You know, that's why there's so much logo, so much God, God's word in math,
[3:39:12.700 --> 3:39:20.660]  because it's that which is true, right? So that's why sodomy is such and just such a
[3:39:20.660 --> 3:39:25.980]  powerful act of defiance, because it takes that which creates life and makes it sterile.
[3:39:25.980 --> 3:39:33.660]  And that's what's happening with all of feminism. Because now the draft, and this is a valid,
[3:39:33.660 --> 3:39:38.580]  kind of a valid thing that they're doing. They're saying that women now have to be drafted
[3:39:38.580 --> 3:39:44.180]  in the military. I find that horrifying, obviously. But if women and men are equal and men can
[3:39:44.180 --> 3:39:48.780]  be drafted in the military, it was just in USA Today that women are now going to be drafted
[3:39:48.780 --> 3:39:54.220]  into combat positions of the military. That is the upside down. See, that's the ultimate
[3:39:54.220 --> 3:40:00.500]  trick. The trick is that Jesus is a vampire. Vampire is Jesus, right? That sodomy is brave
[3:40:00.500 --> 3:40:06.180]  and families are bad. Our death are cowardly. It's couldn't be, it couldn't be farther
[3:40:06.180 --> 3:40:10.460]  from the truth. The bravest act you can do is have a child in this world, protect that
[3:40:10.460 --> 3:40:19.060]  child, love that child, knowing what this world is. And abortion, you know, the killing
[3:40:19.060 --> 3:40:25.020]  of the woman's child is an act of strength to these people. It's all upside down. And
[3:40:25.020 --> 3:40:32.460]  when you enter that world of the upside down, it's, you can't navigate it without always
[3:40:32.460 --> 3:40:39.340]  saying what is true. And you don't fully know what is true. Like we aren't God. We don't
[3:40:39.340 --> 3:40:43.660]  know the whole plan. We can only say what we believe to be true, what we see to be true.
[3:40:43.660 --> 3:40:48.900]  And I think that's really important in this time. You know, when we are entering this
[3:40:48.900 --> 3:40:54.140]  full inversion, this subversion, this upside down where life is death and death is life.
[3:40:54.140 --> 3:41:00.420]  Black is, you know, darkness is light, light is darkness. Because the only way I, the way
[3:41:00.420 --> 3:41:07.580]  I judge another human being isn't are they Christian or Catholic or Muslim or Jewish
[3:41:07.580 --> 3:41:14.500]  or atheist is what is yes mean yes and no means no. That's the question. If you're wronged,
[3:41:14.500 --> 3:41:20.340]  you apologize. Do you see apology as apology or do you see the submission? And if those
[3:41:20.340 --> 3:41:27.900]  things are what you are, I will trust you and I'll be your friend. But if not, I won't.
[3:41:27.900 --> 3:41:32.860]  And I, I don't know how I got on this topic. So I was talking about the Oscars and Wiener
[3:41:32.860 --> 3:41:38.460]  Holtz and oh yeah, and the father has been removed and it's for a very specific reason.
[3:41:38.460 --> 3:41:44.660]  I was looking at this image of all these parenting magazines and there was no father in any of
[3:41:44.660 --> 3:41:51.580]  them. It's just single women or there was one, there's two gay guys and that's the only
[3:41:51.580 --> 3:41:57.580]  representation of males. And it's for a reason because the man is a strong father figure
[3:41:57.580 --> 3:42:04.460]  is the connection to logos, you know. And so you remove the father and you get a bunch
[3:42:04.460 --> 3:42:10.100]  of school shootings. You get a bunch of every school shooter in America has had no dad,
[3:42:10.100 --> 3:42:16.100]  no biological dad in the home. And so this, this demonizing of the male of the masculine,
[3:42:16.100 --> 3:42:22.260]  this, this cooking, this soy boy nature of the man now that's coming and happening is
[3:42:22.260 --> 3:42:27.420]  a way to create slaves because you don't have a father saying, don't do that. That's wrong.
[3:42:27.420 --> 3:42:32.660]  You know, and so these children grow up to become narcissists and slave to their own
[3:42:32.660 --> 3:42:38.620]  appetites and that's the future we have. All right, I'll be back in a little bit. I thought
[3:42:38.620 --> 3:42:42.660]  that was going to be a very cohesive segment on the Oscars and I started talking about
[3:42:42.660 --> 3:43:02.460]  Jesus and vampires, but you know, it's info wars. I'll see you guys in a little bit. Cheers.

[3:47:06.260 --> 3:47:09.460]  From the front lines of the Information War,
[3:47:09.460 --> 3:47:14.460]  it's Alex Jones with Owen Benjamin.
[3:47:17.980 --> 3:47:19.980]  Hi, everybody. I'm back.
[3:47:19.980 --> 3:47:22.980]  And so, this episode or this segment,
[3:47:22.980 --> 3:47:24.980]  I'd like to talk about, you know,
[3:47:24.980 --> 3:47:28.980]  everyone's been talking about the Jesse Smollett situation.
[3:47:28.980 --> 3:47:31.980]  And let's get to the root of it.
[3:47:31.980 --> 3:47:35.980]  My friend Stephen Crowder and I made this sketch
[3:47:35.980 --> 3:47:36.980]  over a year ago.
[3:47:36.980 --> 3:47:39.980]  It's called Hate Crime Court, I believe.
[3:47:39.980 --> 3:47:40.980]  I'll play you guys a little piece of it.
[3:47:40.980 --> 3:47:42.980]  You can watch the rest of it at YouTube.com
[3:47:42.980 --> 3:47:45.980]  slash Owen Benjamin Comedy.

[3:47:48.980 --> 3:47:51.980]  Court, the people are real.
[3:47:51.980 --> 3:47:54.980]  The case is... maybe.
[3:47:54.980 --> 3:47:55.980]  This is Razzmatazz.
[3:47:55.980 --> 3:47:58.980]  He's accusing the defendant of striking him with a baseball bat
[3:47:58.980 --> 3:48:00.980]  twice in the ribs because he's homosexual.
[3:48:00.980 --> 3:48:02.980]  This is not K. Jared.
[3:48:02.980 --> 3:48:05.980]  He claims Razzmatazz is full of shit.
[3:48:05.980 --> 3:48:08.980]  Honorable Judge Van Andel presiding, please rise.
[3:48:12.980 --> 3:48:16.980]  So, Jared, it appears you assaulted Razzmatazz
[3:48:16.980 --> 3:48:20.980]  with a baseball bat striking him twice in the rib cage.
[3:48:20.980 --> 3:48:24.980]  Now, you are being charged with assault with a deadly weapon with...
[3:48:24.980 --> 3:48:26.980]  Your Honor, as a gay man,
[3:48:26.980 --> 3:48:29.980]  I requested he gets the Hate Crime amount of years.
[3:48:29.980 --> 3:48:30.980]  Like, a lot of years.
[3:48:30.980 --> 3:48:33.980]  Not that normal amount, you give normal people.
[3:48:33.980 --> 3:48:36.980]  I want you to, you know, he hate crime me.
[3:48:36.980 --> 3:48:37.980]  Give him a hell of a judge.
[3:48:37.980 --> 3:48:39.980]  Your Honor, this man is not gay.
[3:48:39.980 --> 3:48:41.980]  I caught him having sex with my wife.
[3:48:41.980 --> 3:48:43.980]  He just wants me to go to prison.
[3:48:43.980 --> 3:48:46.980]  He hates crime, Your Honor.
[3:48:46.980 --> 3:48:49.980]  This man was motivated by pure homophobia.
[3:48:49.980 --> 3:48:51.980]  As he was striking me, he was saying stuff like,
[3:48:51.980 --> 3:48:54.980]  maybe this is a teacher from being gay and sucking off dudes.
[3:48:54.980 --> 3:48:56.980]  Give him hell, Your Honor.
[3:48:56.980 --> 3:48:58.980]  He could have just bought that wig today from Hot Top.
[3:48:58.980 --> 3:48:59.980]  I could see the tag.
[3:48:59.980 --> 3:49:01.980]  That's not a wig. It's my hair.
[3:49:01.980 --> 3:49:03.980]  I also really like my comical romance, Your Honor.
[3:49:03.980 --> 3:49:07.980]  Mr. Razzmatazz, you mean to tell me that you are a homosexual
[3:49:07.980 --> 3:49:10.980]  but we're engaging in relations with this man's wife?
[3:49:10.980 --> 3:49:12.980]  Sexuality is a very complicated thing, Your Honor.
[3:49:12.980 --> 3:49:13.980]  Yes, I'm gay.
[3:49:13.980 --> 3:49:16.980]  I prefer to exclusively have sex with women.
[3:49:16.980 --> 3:49:17.980]  Give him hell, Your Honor.
[3:49:17.980 --> 3:49:18.980]  Hate crime me.
[3:49:18.980 --> 3:49:20.980]  Well, I'm quite certain he struck you
[3:49:20.980 --> 3:49:23.980]  because you were having sex with his wife.
[3:49:25.980 --> 3:49:26.980]  Look at my shirt.
[3:49:26.980 --> 3:49:28.980]  Look at my fanny pack.
[3:49:28.980 --> 3:49:30.980]  Dude, my name's Razzmatazz.
[3:49:30.980 --> 3:49:31.980]  I'm the gayest guy alive.
[3:49:31.980 --> 3:49:33.980]  No, he changed his name on the driver's license.
[3:49:33.980 --> 3:49:34.980]  His name is Dan.
[3:49:34.980 --> 3:49:35.980]  Says you?
[3:49:35.980 --> 3:49:37.980]  I don't have a f***ing smart card, dude.
[3:49:37.980 --> 3:49:41.980]  Mr. Razzmatazz, that's not how hate crimes work.
[3:49:41.980 --> 3:49:44.980]  Sensing is required to determine motivation
[3:49:44.980 --> 3:49:47.980]  that the crime was committed because the victim is
[3:49:47.980 --> 3:49:49.980]  a part of a marginalized group.
[3:49:49.980 --> 3:49:53.980]  I just told you, he was hitting me because I'm a fairy
[3:49:53.980 --> 3:49:56.980]  and not because I was having sex with his wife.
[3:49:56.980 --> 3:49:57.980]  That never happened.
[3:49:57.980 --> 3:49:59.980]  It's true, Your Honor. I was there.
[3:49:59.980 --> 3:50:03.980]  He repeatedly beat him and called this man a f*** it
[3:50:03.980 --> 3:50:05.980]  while we were doing it.
[3:50:05.980 --> 3:50:07.980]  Thanks, man.
[3:50:07.980 --> 3:50:12.980]  All right, so the beauty of comedy, like honest comedy
[3:50:12.980 --> 3:50:15.980]  is, I think it was Tim Allen who said,
[3:50:15.980 --> 3:50:18.980]  I exaggerate to clarify.
[3:50:18.980 --> 3:50:24.980]  And that's why there's been such a horrible witch hunt
[3:50:24.980 --> 3:50:25.980]  against comedians.
[3:50:25.980 --> 3:50:29.980]  You can get my specials at HugePianist.com
[3:50:29.980 --> 3:50:31.980]  because I have to self-produce them now
[3:50:31.980 --> 3:50:34.980]  because there's a witch hunt against comedians
[3:50:34.980 --> 3:50:37.980]  because we kind of show the future.
[3:50:37.980 --> 3:50:40.980]  Because while we're wrestling with these ideas,
[3:50:40.980 --> 3:50:43.980]  it's literally, no, not literally,
[3:50:43.980 --> 3:50:46.980]  it's metaphorical time travel.
[3:50:46.980 --> 3:50:50.980]  Because what we were mocking is now a story
[3:50:50.980 --> 3:50:52.980]  that people are finally talking about,
[3:50:52.980 --> 3:50:54.980]  like what is a hate crime?
[3:50:54.980 --> 3:50:55.980]  This is ridiculous.
[3:50:55.980 --> 3:50:58.980]  That is, aren't all acts of violence motivated
[3:50:58.980 --> 3:51:00.980]  by some form of hate?
[3:51:00.980 --> 3:51:02.980]  How do you use someone's motivation
[3:51:02.980 --> 3:51:05.980]  to give them more or less years of a sentence
[3:51:05.980 --> 3:51:07.980]  based on their skin color
[3:51:07.980 --> 3:51:09.980]  or their sexual proclivities?
[3:51:09.980 --> 3:51:11.980]  How do you establish someone's gay?
[3:51:11.980 --> 3:51:14.980]  That was another one of the jokes
[3:51:14.980 --> 3:51:18.980]  that the underlying joke of that sketch was,
[3:51:18.980 --> 3:51:20.980]  how do you prove someone's gay?
[3:51:20.980 --> 3:51:23.980]  You know, Rasmataz, the character I wrote for myself,
[3:51:23.980 --> 3:51:27.980]  was saying, listen, judge, I'm a gay guy
[3:51:27.980 --> 3:51:29.980]  who only has sex with women.
[3:51:29.980 --> 3:51:31.980]  You know, hate crime him.
[3:51:31.980 --> 3:51:34.980]  It was motivated by hate, not that I was with his wife.
[3:51:34.980 --> 3:51:37.980]  And do you have to be with one guy?
[3:51:37.980 --> 3:51:39.980]  Do you have to think about guys?
[3:51:39.980 --> 3:51:43.980]  Do you have to really like the song Rainbow Connection?
[3:51:43.980 --> 3:51:48.980]  Like what qualifies someone as part of the gay community?
[3:51:48.980 --> 3:51:52.980]  You know, what if you wear a dress once a week?
[3:51:52.980 --> 3:51:55.980]  What if it's a kilt?
[3:51:55.980 --> 3:52:00.980]  What if you are a big UFC fan, but for the wrong reasons?
[3:52:00.980 --> 3:52:03.980]  And that is when you realize tyranny
[3:52:03.980 --> 3:52:06.980]  and an abandonment of truth and logos have taken over.
[3:52:06.980 --> 3:52:09.980]  And that's why I highly recommend focusing on things
[3:52:09.980 --> 3:52:12.980]  that you can control, your faith, your family, your food,
[3:52:12.980 --> 3:52:14.980]  you know, the three Fs.
[3:52:14.980 --> 3:52:17.980]  But this isn't a new situation.
[3:52:17.980 --> 3:52:19.980]  As we watched this Jesse Smollett thing,
[3:52:19.980 --> 3:52:23.980]  the whole argument over him staging this to get attention,
[3:52:23.980 --> 3:52:28.980]  all that, it's going past the entire interesting meat
[3:52:28.980 --> 3:52:32.980]  of the situation, which is what is a hate crime?
[3:52:32.980 --> 3:52:36.980]  So if someone murders someone just because they hate them,
[3:52:36.980 --> 3:52:38.980]  but let's say someone hates people named Gary.
[3:52:38.980 --> 3:52:40.980]  You're like, I hate Gary's.
[3:52:40.980 --> 3:52:42.980]  My daddy hated Gary's.
[3:52:42.980 --> 3:52:43.980]  His daddy hated Gary's.
[3:52:43.980 --> 3:52:45.980]  I'm a Gary hater.
[3:52:45.980 --> 3:52:48.980]  And you murder everyone you know named Gary.
[3:52:48.980 --> 3:52:50.980]  Is that a hate crime?
[3:52:50.980 --> 3:52:54.980]  No, because being named Gary isn't a protected class,
[3:52:54.980 --> 3:52:56.980]  which brings us full circle to the beginning
[3:52:56.980 --> 3:53:01.980]  of what we're talking about with proxy warriors,
[3:53:01.980 --> 3:53:03.980]  protected classes of people.
[3:53:03.980 --> 3:53:04.980]  It's an irony.
[3:53:04.980 --> 3:53:06.980]  It's one of Satan's punchlines.
[3:53:06.980 --> 3:53:08.980]  Not only are they not protected,
[3:53:08.980 --> 3:53:12.980]  they're set up for absolute disaster.
[3:53:12.980 --> 3:53:17.980]  Gays in this country with this protection legislation
[3:53:17.980 --> 3:53:19.980]  are not being protected.
[3:53:19.980 --> 3:53:22.980]  In fact, it is all just to subvert the family unit
[3:53:22.980 --> 3:53:26.980]  and take down the United States of America.
[3:53:26.980 --> 3:53:28.980]  It's insane.
[3:53:28.980 --> 3:53:31.980]  And you can see it now with the female draft coming up.
[3:53:31.980 --> 3:53:34.980]  Does that sound like the feminism that was preached
[3:53:34.980 --> 3:53:37.980]  by CIA operative, what was that lady's name?
[3:53:37.980 --> 3:53:38.980]  Gloria Steinem?
[3:53:38.980 --> 3:53:40.980]  Of course not.
[3:53:40.980 --> 3:53:41.980]  You know, it starts small.
[3:53:41.980 --> 3:53:45.980]  It starts with like women just want their right to wear pants.
[3:53:45.980 --> 3:53:48.980]  And then before you know it, they're cannon fodder.
[3:53:48.980 --> 3:53:52.980]  And the end game is always to destroy the family
[3:53:52.980 --> 3:53:54.980]  because the family is where you get children
[3:53:54.980 --> 3:53:57.980]  that can withstand slavery.
[3:53:57.980 --> 3:53:59.980]  Freedom comes from responsibility.
[3:53:59.980 --> 3:54:02.980]  Freedom comes responsibility that you get from your father
[3:54:02.980 --> 3:54:05.980]  in compassion and survival that you get from your mother.
[3:54:05.980 --> 3:54:08.980]  Your mother creates the life.
[3:54:08.980 --> 3:54:10.980]  You know, the mother protects the life.
[3:54:10.980 --> 3:54:14.980]  The mother shows a compassionate view of the world,
[3:54:14.980 --> 3:54:18.980]  safety, and then the father shows the harsh realities of the world,
[3:54:18.980 --> 3:54:25.980]  shows work ethic, shows perseverance, shows national identity.
[3:54:25.980 --> 3:54:29.980]  And so without that unit, you have people with no identity,
[3:54:29.980 --> 3:54:32.980]  no family, no safety, no security,
[3:54:32.980 --> 3:54:36.980]  no context, no logos, no logic, no reason,
[3:54:36.980 --> 3:54:39.980]  nothing to allow them to survive in this world,
[3:54:39.980 --> 3:54:41.980]  this world that is designed to kill you.
[3:54:41.980 --> 3:54:43.980]  It's designed to enslave you.
[3:54:43.980 --> 3:54:45.980]  It's a fallen world.
[3:54:45.980 --> 3:54:47.980]  Whether you're a Christian or not,
[3:54:47.980 --> 3:54:49.980]  you can look out the window and realize
[3:54:49.980 --> 3:54:51.980]  that the world is designed to kill you.
[3:54:51.980 --> 3:54:54.980]  And so without the family,
[3:54:54.980 --> 3:54:57.980]  not only are these not protected classes,
[3:54:57.980 --> 3:55:02.980]  we are now honoring and celebrating the broken home.
[3:55:02.980 --> 3:55:04.980]  You know, when you have a...
[3:55:04.980 --> 3:55:06.980]  I didn't watch the Oscars, but in all these award shows,
[3:55:06.980 --> 3:55:08.980]  you're like, well, I come from a single mother
[3:55:08.980 --> 3:55:11.980]  and everyone's like, yeah, no, where was the dad?
[3:55:11.980 --> 3:55:14.980]  It's like, I am gay and proud.
[3:55:14.980 --> 3:55:17.980]  It's like, no, no.
[3:55:17.980 --> 3:55:19.980]  And that isn't homophobia.
[3:55:19.980 --> 3:55:20.980]  That is insane.
[3:55:20.980 --> 3:55:21.980]  That's an insane word.
[3:55:21.980 --> 3:55:23.980]  That doesn't mean anything.
[3:55:23.980 --> 3:55:27.980]  It's one thing to be gay and have to wrestle with that lifestyle.
[3:55:27.980 --> 3:55:28.980]  It's not easy.
[3:55:28.980 --> 3:55:30.980]  And for people like me, and I'm sure a lot of you guys
[3:55:30.980 --> 3:55:34.980]  that have actually had long-term friends that are homosexual,
[3:55:34.980 --> 3:55:36.980]  it's hard.
[3:55:36.980 --> 3:55:38.980]  It's not an easy life.
[3:55:38.980 --> 3:55:41.980]  It's not an easy life.
[3:55:41.980 --> 3:55:43.980]  It's a life without a lot of stability.
[3:55:43.980 --> 3:55:49.980]  It's a life without a lot of chaos and upheaval and isolation.
[3:55:49.980 --> 3:55:52.980]  And it's not easy.
[3:55:52.980 --> 3:56:01.980]  And so to celebrate this new world of up is down and down is up,
[3:56:01.980 --> 3:56:04.980]  it has a purpose,
[3:56:04.980 --> 3:56:07.980]  and the purpose is destroy the family and to make slaves.
[3:56:07.980 --> 3:56:11.980]  Freedom of responsibility is not freedom.
[3:56:11.980 --> 3:56:12.980]  That's slavery.
[3:56:12.980 --> 3:56:15.980]  These are all inverse word tricks where you say,
[3:56:15.980 --> 3:56:17.980]  well, I am free.
[3:56:17.980 --> 3:56:24.980]  I am free to openly be like trans and nude at an elementary school.
[3:56:24.980 --> 3:56:26.980]  Because they're not teaching this to kids.
[3:56:26.980 --> 3:56:33.980]  In England, they teach LGBT, sodomy stuff to kindergartners now,
[3:56:33.980 --> 3:56:35.980]  and you can't take your children out.
[3:56:35.980 --> 3:56:36.980]  It's illegal.
[3:56:36.980 --> 3:56:39.980]  Gay and trans sex education to be taught to five-year-olds in UK
[3:56:39.980 --> 3:56:41.980]  and opting out is illegal.
[3:56:41.980 --> 3:56:42.980]  We all know that.
[3:56:42.980 --> 3:56:43.980]  That's happening in Canada.
[3:56:43.980 --> 3:56:44.980]  It's happening all over Europe.
[3:56:44.980 --> 3:56:47.980]  It's going to happen in America.
[3:56:47.980 --> 3:56:51.980]  That isn't tolerance.
[3:56:51.980 --> 3:56:53.980]  That isn't freedom.
[3:56:53.980 --> 3:56:55.980]  That's the absence of freedom.
[3:56:55.980 --> 3:56:56.980]  That's freedom from responsibility.
[3:56:56.980 --> 3:56:58.980]  And it's now finally hitting people.
[3:56:58.980 --> 3:57:02.980]  It's hitting people that were deluded into thinking that abortion is freedom.
[3:57:02.980 --> 3:57:04.980]  Now that it's 40 weeks,
[3:57:04.980 --> 3:57:07.980]  the most hardcore pro-choice people that I've ever known
[3:57:07.980 --> 3:57:09.980]  are like, yeah, this is horrifying.
[3:57:09.980 --> 3:57:11.980]  And I'm like, this is just the beginning.
[3:57:11.980 --> 3:57:14.980]  Freedom from your own appetite.
[3:57:14.980 --> 3:57:17.980]  Freedom from accountability of your own appetite is not freedom that's slavery.
[3:57:17.980 --> 3:57:20.980]  Freedom comes from discipline.
[3:57:20.980 --> 3:57:23.980]  And discipline comes from the family.
[3:57:23.980 --> 3:57:26.980]  And so the way that I fight things that I can't control
[3:57:26.980 --> 3:57:29.980]  is to have a good marriage, to raise my kids right,
