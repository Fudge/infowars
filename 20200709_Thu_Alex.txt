[00:00.000 --> 00:24.760]  Ladies and gentlemen, every broadcast is jam-packed, but this one is going to be particularly jam-packed
[00:24.760 --> 00:44.880]  on this live July 9th, 2020 worldwide broadcast. Again, we are 116 days out from the election.
[00:44.880 --> 00:51.880]  We have Roger Stone joining us with exclusive information concerning a lot of very important
[00:51.880 --> 01:01.680]  things you can probably imagine. I'll leave it up to him coming up at the bottom of the
[01:01.680 --> 01:10.840]  second hour. Now, the Supreme Court has ruled against the President at least on the surface
[01:10.840 --> 01:16.240]  about his tax returns. Rules Manhattan District attorney can obtain Trump tax returns, but
[01:16.240 --> 01:24.440]  now we'll go back down to a lower court for another fight. You keep the records private
[01:24.440 --> 01:29.120]  for now, so it's another false victory, but in precedent and in law, you're not supposed
[01:29.120 --> 01:36.680]  to do this. And we saw the Clintons and others keep so much private, including their library,
[01:36.680 --> 01:41.840]  you name it. And so this is, again, nothing but presidential harassment. They will then
[01:41.840 --> 01:46.880]  harass all of his business associates. The FBI and others have already gone over all
[01:46.880 --> 01:51.240]  his tax returns. They know there's nothing there. But the Supreme Court says, rule of
[01:51.240 --> 01:56.400]  law, president cannot block release of financial records. Trump rages at the Supreme, subpoena
[01:56.400 --> 02:03.320]  scare. Of course, it's Kavanaugh, join majority. So you see the establishment is just made
[02:03.320 --> 02:10.560]  up of a bunch of cowards. 72 Decision rocks the political landscape. Those are the headlines
[02:10.560 --> 02:20.400]  of it. Roger report.com. Roger Stone joins us coming up at the bottom of the next hour.
[02:20.400 --> 02:26.340]  And he's got big news. And it's so big that I just think I'm going to let him cover what
[02:26.340 --> 02:33.000]  he wants to cover. And I'm not even going to give you any preludes or any hints. But
[02:33.000 --> 02:37.440]  let's just say this in the next six days before he's scheduled to be sent to prison
[02:37.440 --> 02:40.920]  for a crown. He didn't commit as a political prisoner. He's going to work to make this
[02:40.920 --> 02:45.200]  the exclusive first place he comes on. Now, if he gets pardoned or gets clemency the next
[02:45.200 --> 02:50.200]  few days at six o'clock at night, and I don't answer the phone immediately. No, I can't get
[02:50.200 --> 02:55.680]  a crew down here in 20 minutes. We won't get the exclusive. That's okay. I just wanted
[02:55.680 --> 03:00.520]  to get clemency or pardon. So I told him, just make the first phone call and we can't
[03:00.520 --> 03:04.920]  get stuff fired up. You know, go ahead and go on Fox News or whatever. But he's had a
[03:04.920 --> 03:10.520]  lot of dirty tricks against him the last few days that he'll be getting into at the bottom
[03:10.520 --> 03:17.040]  of the next hour. They've had people having CNN call up and misrepresent that Roger has
[03:17.040 --> 03:21.840]  told them things when he hasn't even talked to CNN. A lot of this information. And so
[03:21.840 --> 03:27.440]  expect them to really try some criminal stuff. They are criminal organization. Also, Roger
[03:27.440 --> 03:35.040]  Stone has seen thousands of accounts. People he doesn't even know. In most cases are people
[03:35.040 --> 03:41.440]  he shook their hand at an event who post stuff about Roger saying he's innocent. Facebook
[03:41.440 --> 03:48.280]  and others Instagram are calling it in authentic activity and are banning people from supporting
[03:48.280 --> 03:54.280]  Roger and suspending or cancel their accounts. Same thing just happened to Bolsonaro. Thousands
[03:54.280 --> 04:02.320]  of Brazilians that promote his speeches. Well, they're saying, well, that's inauthentic.
[04:02.320 --> 04:05.560]  Because Facebook can go in and read of the thousands of people posting a stuff and find
[04:05.560 --> 04:10.160]  one or two where somebody from the campaign or the president's office sends an email back
[04:10.160 --> 04:15.520]  or a message saying, thank you. And so there's any contact between Bolsonaro and then that's
[04:15.520 --> 04:19.120]  called inauthentic. Even though Democrats can reach out to their millions of minions
[04:19.120 --> 04:25.160]  and activate them. Socialists can do that in Brazil. He's not even allowed to send messages
[04:25.160 --> 04:31.480]  back over his Facebook mass messages saying, thank you. That's inauthentic. So this is
[04:31.480 --> 04:35.920]  the whole Internet is a giant control grid to suppress the populations and we the people
[04:35.920 --> 04:40.200]  of America and the West of the world need to say, no, we're not accepting the Communist
[04:40.200 --> 04:45.280]  Chinese model. Now we have the biggest COVID news yet. It's seriously just gets crazier
[04:45.280 --> 04:52.560]  all coming up on the other side info wars.com news wars.com tomorrow's news today. And we
[04:52.560 --> 05:03.040]  have in the studio are Europe wars.com reporter Dan Lyman, the fourth of July 2020. We are
[05:03.040 --> 05:08.240]  here and despite all the globalist attacks, you the viewers and listeners of this transmission
[05:08.240 --> 05:13.440]  have supported us by prayer, by word of mouth and by buying the products and you have done
[05:13.440 --> 05:20.240]  all of this. So when you look at the huge effect info wars has had, I want you to understand
[05:20.240 --> 05:26.840]  that it's because of what you have done and myself and the whole crew salute you on this
[05:26.840 --> 05:32.160]  July 4th 2020. We've got a lot of our best selling products that were sold out DNA Force
[05:32.160 --> 05:39.040]  plus bodies, ultra 12 and others that have been sold out for months back in stock 50%
[05:39.040 --> 05:42.960]  off for the fourth of July. We're running a special one. I encourage you to get these
[05:42.960 --> 05:47.880]  products because they have enriched my life so much. I know they'll enrich your life.
[05:47.880 --> 05:53.160]  And regardless, it's a total 360 win because it funds the info war. The only way we fail
[05:53.160 --> 05:57.200]  is when you don't take action. I don't need to tell you that you already took action and
[05:57.200 --> 06:19.000]  I salute and thank you. 116. That's how many days to the historic election. The Democrat
[06:19.000 --> 06:24.080]  each state is openly trying to cancel. Now officially coming out the New York Times for
[06:24.080 --> 06:30.600]  their publications saying that there shouldn't even be debates or it should be remote so
[06:30.600 --> 06:37.320]  they can put teleprompter statements up to Joe Biden's. You can read off a screen and
[06:37.320 --> 06:42.800]  that the last 15, 20 minutes of the debate should be mainstream media fact checking the
[06:42.800 --> 06:48.160]  president to tell viewers he's full of crap. They are really trying to tie everybody's
[06:48.160 --> 06:53.680]  hands behind their backs, but no one more so than the president of the United States
[06:53.680 --> 06:58.560]  who has been standing up for our Republic and trying to restore American strength, jobs
[06:58.560 --> 07:10.160]  and national security. There is so much coming up today. Well, did the Supreme Court really
[07:10.160 --> 07:22.880]  rule against the president? They did in a seven to two big majority, Kavanaugh and Gorshich
[07:22.880 --> 07:31.400]  both that he nominated going against him. Seventy Decision Rocks political world. Congress
[07:31.400 --> 07:36.280]  denied for now because what they really did on a technicality was send it back. Supreme
[07:36.280 --> 07:41.320]  Court rules Manhattan, District Attorney can obtain tax returns, but it is a circuitous
[07:41.320 --> 07:48.840]  route. Court rulings keep Trump's financial records private. For now, the Supreme Court
[07:48.840 --> 07:56.120]  allows prosecutor, but not Congress to get financial records saying it's part of criminal
[07:56.120 --> 08:04.360]  investigation going on out of the Manhattan District Attorney's office. And I can tell
[08:04.360 --> 08:10.160]  you that that office has been harassing the living hell out of thousands of prominent
[08:10.160 --> 08:16.880]  Trump supporters, not just in New York, but in the United States and the Attorney General
[08:16.880 --> 08:24.920]  of New York. Leticia James ran on destroying Trump and his associates and supporters and
[08:24.920 --> 08:32.000]  was fully financed by George Soros, just like the mayor and District Attorney in Chicago,
[08:32.000 --> 08:37.200]  just a District Attorney in St. Louis, like the District Attorney in San Francisco, whose
[08:37.200 --> 08:49.000]  parents were in the weatherman underground. So that's what these frauds do. Leticia James
[08:49.000 --> 08:56.360]  know she's a liar and know she sent people that were healthy, but positive for COVID-19
[08:56.360 --> 09:02.760]  into nursing homes to get the death numbers up. She ordered the nursing homes to do that.
[09:02.760 --> 09:06.400]  And what's incredible is she put out a false statement against me as an example of the
[09:06.400 --> 09:12.120]  things they do saying we had a COVID-19 cure and stopped saying we had a cure when we said
[09:12.120 --> 09:20.920]  no such thing. But that's how these frauds operate. CNN says Trump hates all Mexicans.
[09:20.920 --> 09:26.720]  Says there's a video. There is no video even close to that. But then it's up to Trump
[09:26.720 --> 09:34.680]  to disprove a negative like when did you start raping or beating your wife? But because they
[09:34.680 --> 09:42.040]  never get held accountable, they just keep doubling down with the lies. And let's get
[09:42.040 --> 09:48.640]  into the big COVID-19 news right now. I have pointed this out for six months looking at
[09:48.640 --> 09:54.440]  the literature since this story began to arrive in January. Hard to believe it's already been
[09:54.440 --> 10:02.360]  six months. And it's said in the medical literature that in Taiwan and Hong Kong and Japan, they
[10:02.360 --> 10:07.280]  were having almost 100% success rate with people that came in with these type mnemonias
[10:07.280 --> 10:14.320]  because it was mainly an autoimmune response. And so with this particular phenomenon, giving
[10:14.320 --> 10:24.320]  them an anti-inflammatory, particularly a steroid would knock it out through a nebulizer.
[10:24.320 --> 10:30.560]  And we'll tell you about that particular drug when we come back. But now a Texas doctor
[10:30.560 --> 10:36.880]  that headed up Rick Perry's task force for the state on healthcare for seven years was
[10:36.880 --> 10:41.600]  at a conference in Dallas and was on a local TV show. And now the video has over a million
[10:41.600 --> 10:46.720]  views. And he talked about having total success rate with his emergency room patients with
[10:46.720 --> 11:04.280]  this steroid nebulized. They are now attacking him all over the news. And saying he's a bad
[11:04.280 --> 11:07.720]  guy. And they went and interviewed the patients. They said, no, it's all true. Felix's money
[11:07.720 --> 11:14.320]  was sitting on my chest until I went on this. And within a day, it went away. Others said
[11:14.320 --> 11:20.960]  within two days, they said it was almost immediate when they nebulize it into the lungs and also
[11:20.960 --> 11:27.360]  do it in an inhaler. They know this. They knew this when the NIH followed the UN directives
[11:27.360 --> 11:32.200]  to put an intubation tube into the lungs. And then the last thing you want when they're
[11:32.200 --> 11:36.600]  inflamed is to expand them because it makes the blood vessels all break and they kill
[11:36.600 --> 11:40.320]  you. That's why the majority of the deaths were either old people in nursing homes or
[11:40.320 --> 11:48.440]  people on respirators and doctors and nurses from New York to Missouri to Illinois to California
[11:48.440 --> 11:51.840]  have gone public saying, listen, the person would come and say they were coughing, having
[11:51.840 --> 11:57.680]  trouble breathing, but that we wouldn't even try a steroid. We wouldn't even try hydroxychloroquine.
[11:57.680 --> 12:05.960]  We would just put a tube down their throat and they'd die. And you better watch out because
[12:05.960 --> 12:10.840]  they're opening new testing centers, hundreds of them a week. They're opening several today
[12:10.840 --> 12:15.960]  in Austin, big ones, taxpayer paid for, and people are running into be COVID movie stars
[12:15.960 --> 12:21.720]  to get two weeks off, to be, oh, I got it. I'm so cool. Almost all the tests are false
[12:21.720 --> 12:25.960]  positive. That's mainstream news. The federal guidelines admit almost all of its false positives.
[12:25.960 --> 12:31.360]  You've ever had a flu or coronavirus the last decade, but you go in and say, oh, I'm having
[12:31.360 --> 12:36.520]  anxiety or I'm coughing or I've got the sniffles, they'll grab you, strap your ass down and
[12:36.520 --> 12:41.480]  run a tube down your throat. They keep saying, we don't know why it's in the minority areas
[12:41.480 --> 12:45.320]  that most people are dying because that's where you got the health department eugenics
[12:45.320 --> 12:51.280]  run facilities that actually have the cult members in them that are killing you. Notice
[12:51.280 --> 12:54.400]  media matters attacked me for this three months ago when I said they're killing people on
[12:54.400 --> 13:01.040]  purpose in the hospitals. It has come out that they are there is a contingent of cult
[13:01.040 --> 13:07.920]  members like the governor of Virginia that ran the organ harvesting of living babies
[13:07.920 --> 13:13.400]  that are in control of the democratic party is a literal ghoul operation of devil worshiping
[13:13.400 --> 13:18.480]  Satanist that are doing this through the medical system. Now I know that sounds insane. They
[13:18.480 --> 13:25.520]  are insane. Dying to play the governor going, we decided the woman want the baby and the
[13:25.520 --> 13:30.560]  woman don't want the baby. We call it don't resuscitate. Then we keep them comfortable
[13:30.560 --> 13:36.680]  until they die. Well, resuscitate means you've you've died or your heart stopped and we restart
[13:36.680 --> 13:40.760]  it. But we don't their term resuscitate is different in the Virginia law. They have a
[13:40.760 --> 13:46.600]  law there. So does New York that you can keep babies alive for up to two weeks to a month
[13:46.600 --> 13:51.880]  depending on the state. While you get the orders in to harvest them, then you do a procedure,
[13:51.880 --> 13:56.280]  you harvest them, you suck their blood out, their skin, all of it, every little juicy
[13:56.280 --> 14:04.080]  drop of a seven pound little ball of joy, seven pounds, six ounces week. She decided
[14:04.080 --> 14:10.240]  not to resuscitate that it legally is dead. It's not it's legally not counted as a human.
[14:10.240 --> 14:13.960]  Then it passes to the fire of Mollick and instead of having to harvest real quick and
[14:13.960 --> 14:19.960]  hope they've got orders in. They get them the fresh juices and they've tested all this
[14:19.960 --> 14:24.560]  out in communist China and now it's been brought here and there are what is it five states
[14:24.560 --> 14:29.560]  have passed laws to keep babies alive after they're dead and harvest them. And it just
[14:29.560 --> 14:35.600]  came out the lawsuit from a decade ago or just now winning where the FDA was paying across
[14:35.600 --> 14:41.280]  the nation hundreds of thousands of dollars, millions of dollars total for quote, fresh
[14:41.280 --> 14:48.440]  baby parts with still beating hearts. Berkeley in one particular filing that just came out
[14:48.440 --> 15:02.240]  last year said we want beating hearts. And so they would deliver them a baby actually
[15:02.240 --> 15:08.320]  in a box and they would butcher them right there on the spot. It's like I can pick up
[15:08.320 --> 15:13.600]  and order some hot wings or whatever. Now, now where is PETA not caring about all this?
[15:13.600 --> 15:17.480]  And by the way, if you're a new listener and you're hearing this, this is all on record.
[15:17.480 --> 15:26.840]  Just type in university ordered beating hearts of babies or FDA ordered fresh baby parts.
[15:26.840 --> 15:30.440]  That just came out last week. There's thousands of these articles. So that's who they are.
[15:30.440 --> 15:35.480]  They want to murder you and your family. And they're hiding in plain view, certain hospitals,
[15:35.480 --> 15:38.960]  certain facilities, blue states, blue cities, almost always Democrats. You got Republican
[15:38.960 --> 15:44.960]  doctors doing a great job caring. They though are naive until they brush up against them.
[15:44.960 --> 15:48.400]  My dad in Dallas brushed up against him. He told me when I was looking at my driver's
[15:48.400 --> 15:52.360]  license, don't sound the organ donor card. Some hospitals here in a car wreck will kill
[15:52.360 --> 15:57.200]  you for your organs came out later on 60 minutes. He was right about Dallas. I told
[15:57.200 --> 16:02.160]  you this five months ago and now it's official. The lockdown is directed by the United Nations
[16:02.160 --> 16:07.360]  and he is permanent. The psychological war chiefs that developed the COVID-19 mind control
[16:07.360 --> 16:12.160]  hoax knew that once they got the public for several months to wear mask and social distance,
[16:12.160 --> 16:16.960]  they would be able to permanently turn it on and off anytime they want by putting handcuffs
[16:16.960 --> 16:22.400]  on someone and then add new demands that people take force inoculations that they have contact
[16:22.400 --> 16:27.760]  tracing on their phones and that every aspect of our lives be controlled. This is all complete
[16:27.760 --> 16:32.880]  and total preparation for world government forced inoculation and complete enslavement
[16:32.880 --> 16:38.920]  of the human population. This is medical tyranny. This is the Bill and Melinda Gates UN takeover.
[16:38.920 --> 16:44.720]  This is the end of civilization. As you know it, living in denial only empowers the enemy.
[16:44.720 --> 16:49.560]  If you want to break free from this trance, there's not much time. Want everyone you know
[16:49.560 --> 16:53.440]  that it's a giant hoax? Show them the numbers. Show them the facts and explain that it's
[16:53.440 --> 16:56.520]  the end of the world as we know it if we don't wake up and resist.
[16:56.520 --> 17:03.320]  The 4th of July 2020 special has gone into high gear. We have 50% off bodies, really

[17:51.000 --> 17:55.880]  I thank you for your continued prayer, your focus and your support. Again, I salute you
[17:55.880 --> 17:59.880]  all.
[17:59.880 --> 18:09.880]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[18:09.880 --> 18:28.600]  If you just tuned in, I'm not trying to be macabre. I'm not trying to shock you. During
[18:28.600 --> 18:35.240]  the break, the crew heard me talking about it. They pulled it up. In court, CEO of abortion
[18:35.240 --> 18:42.480]  company admitted to harvesting, beating baby hearts and delivering them on video to Berkeley
[18:42.480 --> 18:51.280]  and other universities. You understand? And I can show you last week where the FDA paid
[18:51.280 --> 18:57.600]  for fresh, never-frozen baby parts. Now, here's Breitbart. China's Cultural Revolution featured
[18:57.600 --> 19:03.760]  cannibal flesh banquets. But here's Business Insider. Flesh banquets of China's Cultural
[19:03.760 --> 19:10.360]  Revolution remain unspoken. Where youth brigades went and grabbed even their parents, chopped
[19:10.360 --> 19:18.680]  them up, put them in cauldrons as an act of dominance and ate them. Flesh banquets of
[19:18.680 --> 19:24.840]  China's Cultural Revolution remain unspoken. So once you understand, the left is literally
[19:24.840 --> 19:29.600]  about death and destruction. They're not liberals. America was founded on liberal ideas. That
[19:29.600 --> 19:36.920]  means freedom. They've changed the definition. Leftist means left-hand path or the path
[19:36.920 --> 19:45.200]  of Satan, the path of the devil. And in mainline history books, the Cultural Revolution of
[19:45.200 --> 19:51.760]  the French Revolution was run by Satanists. And they had human sacrifice, drank blood,
[19:51.760 --> 19:58.800]  ate bodies, ate baby parts. This is all real. So Hollywood pushes all this but says, oh,
[19:58.800 --> 20:03.680]  Christians are nuts. This never happened. Every culture ends up degenerating and sacrificing
[20:03.680 --> 20:08.280]  men, women, and children. Every culture. I don't care. It was the ancient Mesoamericans,
[20:08.280 --> 20:16.120]  the ancient Germanics, the ancient Chinese, the ancient Africans. All over the Pacific,
[20:16.120 --> 20:21.120]  they still eat each other. It's ritualistic. The men go out and hunt each other from other
[20:21.120 --> 20:30.360]  tribes and then eat them for their essence. And so that's the Old Testament where you
[20:30.360 --> 20:37.600]  have Abraham about to sacrifice his son and then the angel comes and holds his hand and
[20:37.600 --> 20:44.800]  says, you don't need to do human sacrifice anymore. So the Old Testament very early on
[20:44.800 --> 20:50.560]  is about, let's stop sacrificing children. Anybody that does it, you need to, what does
[20:50.560 --> 20:56.080]  the Old Testament say? If your neighbors are giving their children to Moloch, kill them
[20:56.080 --> 21:02.520]  all. That's what he says in the Bible. If you are next to people that are sacrificing
[21:02.520 --> 21:09.760]  children, kill them. Wipe them out. So the history books, the archaeology, the sociology,
[21:09.760 --> 21:17.880]  the anthropology, it's all, get that murder, eat children, get that murder, eat children.
[21:17.880 --> 21:22.840]  And so we sit here in a Christian civilization in the fading light of it going, that's ridiculous.
[21:22.840 --> 21:31.040]  There's no way they're keeping babies alive. I just showed you mainline news. And the whole
[21:31.040 --> 21:35.720]  communist Chinese model is what the left admits they're operating in. Okay, let me get into
[21:35.720 --> 21:42.080]  the COVID-19 developments. They come out and say only 15 days because the hospitals are
[21:42.080 --> 21:48.000]  going to be full. There's going to be 2.2, 2.5 million dead. Just stay in for 15 days.
[21:48.000 --> 21:52.600]  And then I said, they'll never take it off. They'll loosen it a bit and then tighten it
[21:52.600 --> 21:57.400]  back up. They want this power. They want contact tracers. They want to be able to arrest you.
[21:57.400 --> 22:01.120]  You don't take force inoculations or if you leave your house. And now counties all over
[22:01.120 --> 22:05.920]  the U.S. in some states are saying you leave your house six months in jail if you, quote,
[22:05.920 --> 22:11.040]  have COVID-19 or tested positive with a false positive or whatever. And then they come out
[22:11.040 --> 22:17.280]  with a vaccine. Then they come out with a force inoculation. It's all pre-planned. So now
[22:17.280 --> 22:21.520]  the blue cities and blue states are going, well, we really don't want to have to do it,
[22:21.520 --> 22:25.240]  but it looks like we're going to have to do it again because of the spiking cases, spiking
[22:25.240 --> 22:33.240]  cases, 63,000 cases, the worst day ever. It's all caused by Republicans not staying in
[22:33.240 --> 22:38.400]  their houses, but Black Lives Matter and the left marching around everywhere, that's okay.
[22:38.400 --> 22:42.400]  So there's also suspension of common sense and of logic and of mathematics here that
[22:42.400 --> 22:48.560]  you always see when you're inside a tyranny. So we have all of that. And so you have the
[22:48.560 --> 22:53.160]  mayor of Austin, the mayor of Houston, the mayor of LA, the governor of California, and
[22:53.160 --> 22:58.360]  the governor of Texas saying, well, we don't want to do another 35-day lockdown. Don't leave
[22:58.360 --> 23:02.160]  your house, but we think we're going to have to do it. Let's see if things keep spiking.
[23:02.160 --> 23:07.480]  And they know as new testing centers open every day in every state. I mean, Austin's
[23:07.480 --> 23:12.480]  got two opening this weekend, everyone flocks to be part of the coolness, and the employers
[23:12.480 --> 23:18.320]  are told by their lawyers, well, you better just get everybody tested just to be safe.
[23:18.320 --> 23:23.720]  And then most of your staff are going to test positive because most people have had a coronavirus
[23:23.720 --> 23:29.400]  or a flu virus in the last decade, and you will show not just the antibodies, that's
[23:29.400 --> 23:34.080]  not the majority of tests, you will show the detritus of an infection. That's in the literature,
[23:34.080 --> 23:38.360]  the main line, showing you the whole reports here, governor admits it. A bunch of states
[23:38.360 --> 23:43.280]  have refused to do it saying it's a fraud, saying the tests aren't real. Those states
[23:43.280 --> 23:51.520]  have no COVID-19, basically. We have it horrible because we have testing centers everywhere.
[23:51.520 --> 23:56.120]  And to show that we're into the fear and into the falsehood, we wear the mask over our face
[23:56.120 --> 24:01.600]  that does absolutely nothing and is a total fraud, and the medical literature admits all
[24:01.600 --> 24:11.000]  of that. So here's some of the headlines. U.S. corona cases rise above 60,000, setting
[24:11.000 --> 24:16.680]  single-day record for one day. That's Reuters. Should read, as testing continues to ramp
[24:16.680 --> 24:23.200]  up to record levels, the number of positive skyrockets and most positives are fraudulent.
[24:23.200 --> 24:30.160]  But no, now it's infection rates what matters. Not that the death numbers are going down,
[24:30.160 --> 24:35.440]  but see, once the fall comes and there's regular deaths from flu and regular deaths from pneumonia
[24:35.440 --> 24:39.760]  because people don't get their sunshine and don't get their zinc and don't get their D3
[24:39.760 --> 24:45.040]  and don't get their vitamin C, they're going to put them all in the death column and it's
[24:45.040 --> 24:48.840]  going to go back up even more. And you notice it just never works. We'll never get out of
[24:48.840 --> 24:59.120]  it because it's a coronavirus and everybody's got it in them. But Dr. Birx attributes coronavirus
[24:59.120 --> 25:04.560]  case spikes to reopening too fast. We know how to stop the spread. Really? Stop using
[25:04.560 --> 25:12.800]  fake tests? Worsening U.S. outbreak prompts tough actions as new coronavirus cases hit
[25:12.800 --> 25:20.840]  record, not deaths, but new record. Los Angeles City coronavirus update. Mayor warns of possible
[25:20.840 --> 25:25.440]  a new stay-at-home order. All options on the table. We didn't want to do it. He said two
[25:25.440 --> 25:31.600]  days ago, we're not sure. Well, it's on the table. We're doing it. Sorry. Fears coronavirus
[25:31.600 --> 25:35.400]  will spark brain damage epidemic as even mild cases cause inflammation. Well, that's what
[25:35.400 --> 25:40.560]  vaccines do is cause inflammation. Oh, now you're telling us that viruses cause inflammation
[25:40.560 --> 25:46.160]  and that vaccines do it and they're a problem? Oh, they don't tell you. Take Benadryl. They
[25:46.160 --> 25:50.280]  don't tell you. Take steroids from your doctor. That's how you handle it. That's why they've
[25:50.280 --> 26:00.040]  had seven cases in places like Taiwan because they know it's all fake and they know it's
[26:00.040 --> 26:05.880]  all false positive. But for the few people that actually die that do test positive, it's
[26:05.880 --> 26:09.760]  seven. And the doctors are saying, well, it's cause they took this steroid. Well, yeah,
[26:09.760 --> 26:12.760]  because a lot of people are going to die from regular pneumonia and a lot of that is an
[26:12.760 --> 26:17.200]  autoimmune response. So of course that's what you prescribe people to test that have pneumonia
[26:17.200 --> 26:20.400]  if they can't breathe. You give them a steroid because a lot of times it's an autoimmune
[26:20.400 --> 26:24.800]  response. It's not really water in the lungs. If you x-ray somebody and there's not a bunch
[26:24.800 --> 26:29.160]  of water in there, two thirds of the way up, then you know it's an autoimmune response.
[26:29.160 --> 26:34.480]  It's why they're slowing just like one of these things and you can't breathe and you
[26:34.480 --> 26:38.920]  epi pen, baby, epi pen, but they won't tell you that because they want to get the death
[26:38.920 --> 26:44.760]  numbers up to keep everything shut down, roll out forced inoculations and the total tracking
[26:44.760 --> 26:48.880]  of everything you do with these apps on the phones. It's all a stated plan and they're
[26:48.880 --> 26:52.760]  systematically rolling it out and any government official that goes along with it is an enemy
[26:52.760 --> 26:55.760]  of America.
[26:55.760 --> 27:14.040]  The state of Texas confirms that the CDC and NIH have created a system where anyone that
[27:14.040 --> 27:21.160]  has a sore throat or a runny nose or who has been in contact with someone COVID-19 is then
[27:21.160 --> 27:26.360]  added into the database as having a case that is counted as a case of COVID-19. It's in
[27:26.360 --> 27:31.000]  the NIH documents. It's at the state level. We confirmed it in Texas. We're not confirming.
[27:31.000 --> 27:35.720]  It's in other states. This is beyond the other smoking guns of them putting people to die
[27:35.720 --> 27:41.040]  of gunshot wounds and stuff in the COVID column and the false positive test. That's all huge.
[27:41.040 --> 27:47.480]  This is beyond that mega criminal activity and we've got these different county commission
[27:47.480 --> 27:51.680]  videos where they're just freaking out over it saying what in the world is this? The full
[27:51.680 --> 27:55.160]  video is supposed to be banned on video. Get it out and expose the hoax.

[29:58.080 --> 30:18.400]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show. Waging War on Corruption. It's Alex Jones.
[30:18.400 --> 30:25.040]  If you just tuned in and you hear me telling you that there are hundreds of hospitals and
[30:25.040 --> 30:33.400]  clinics and mental institutions and facilities where mad scientist, mad doctors, mad nurses
[30:33.400 --> 30:37.040]  get away with killing people, get away with killing preemie babies, get away with euthanizing
[30:37.040 --> 30:42.960]  old people, you're just not informed. We all know the Nazis got their go ahead and their
[30:42.960 --> 30:48.240]  impetus from mad scientist in England and the United States with eugenics and Margaret
[30:48.240 --> 30:55.320]  Sanger and Planned Parenthood. That's in the Nuremberg Trials. We also know that the head
[30:55.320 --> 31:02.360]  scientist for the Nazis who ran the final solution was Dr. Joseph Mengele. We know in
[31:02.360 --> 31:08.640]  the Soviet Russia medical tyranny was one of their key suppression systems. So we think
[31:08.640 --> 31:13.960]  of doctors as just perfect angels and under Hippocrates for thousands of years and the
[31:13.960 --> 31:20.400]  Hippocratic oath, the West we said do no harm. But when you're around death and disease,
[31:20.400 --> 31:25.680]  you get very callous and a lot of people get into it because they already think of themselves
[31:25.680 --> 31:32.760]  as elitist and they get recruited by the eugenics organizations. So when you get Bayer pharmaceutical
[31:32.760 --> 31:36.640]  documents that I've talked about a lot, we're back during the 80s when the Clintons were
[31:36.640 --> 31:43.320]  governors of co-governor, I call them, but when Bill Clinton was governor of Arkansas,
[31:43.320 --> 31:50.480]  from the 80s into the early 90s, it came out in France, Australia and the U.S. in court
[31:50.480 --> 31:55.480]  that they knowingly allowed the inmates to give blood way over the level they were allowed
[31:55.480 --> 32:00.840]  to. It didn't test for HIV or hepatitis and let people with it give the blood and then
[32:00.840 --> 32:08.000]  ship it up to Canada and have it shipped out of the world to be put in hemophiliac medication,
[32:08.000 --> 32:13.600]  factor eight, clotting agent. And almost everyone that got it ended up contracting hepatitis
[32:13.600 --> 32:18.480]  and or HIV and dying. And of course it came out in those famous Bayer pharmaceutical documents
[32:18.480 --> 32:23.400]  where the regional directors are saying, well, so what? There's too many hemophiliacs. They
[32:23.400 --> 32:29.480]  put that in the minutes of their meetings with a stenographer in the room at board meetings.
[32:29.480 --> 32:34.800]  And you're at board meetings and you're just sitting around, well, we shipped out over
[32:34.800 --> 32:39.040]  two million doses just to factor eight to hit the hemophiliacs and going to kill most
[32:39.040 --> 32:46.400]  of them with hepatitis and HIV and they, so what? Too many of them. Laughter. Remember
[32:46.400 --> 32:52.800]  Larry Grathwald and the Weatherman meetings? They all had PhDs in there. They were all
[32:52.800 --> 32:57.040]  calmly talking about how they're going to shut the economy up, bankrupt everything,
[32:57.040 --> 33:01.720]  starve out Americans and kill 25 million people, put 50 million in reeducation camps. They
[33:01.720 --> 33:05.160]  were dead serious talking about it very calmly like you talk about going down to the store
[33:05.160 --> 33:12.680]  and getting a gallon of milk. You better, I better, we all better start realizing the
[33:12.680 --> 33:17.920]  enemy we're up against. They're cold-blooded. They're psychotic. They're sociopathic. They
[33:17.920 --> 33:23.480]  enjoy the power over you and your family and complying with them and groveling to them
[33:23.480 --> 33:31.600]  and going along with them will get you destroyed. The whole Rockefeller New World Order system
[33:31.600 --> 33:35.360]  is about a medical tyranny. The whole UN takeover plan is about a worldwide medical
[33:35.360 --> 33:40.080]  tyranny. They're coming with forced inoculations they admit are going to hurt you. And the
[33:40.080 --> 33:43.920]  big corporations in the blue states and the airlines aren't going to let you travel or
[33:43.920 --> 33:57.320]  live unless you comply. And that's going to be phase one. Now, I want to get into all
[33:57.320 --> 34:05.000]  the fraud of COVID-19 and a plan they have to set Trump up when we come back from break.
[34:05.000 --> 34:10.600]  But I want to air part of this special report. It's at Band-Aut Video. It's at newswars.com.
[34:10.600 --> 34:14.120]  And this doctor who, by the way, I didn't just believe him, I went and looked into who
[34:14.120 --> 34:18.280]  he was and headed up Rick Perry's task force for seven years. First was on the task force
[34:18.280 --> 34:24.160]  and headed it up for medical activity in Texas. But I didn't just believe him when I saw
[34:24.160 --> 34:31.140]  this viral video that just came out a couple of days ago. I already knew that inflammation
[34:31.140 --> 34:39.000]  drugs like Butte disonide are having basically 100% success rate. A steroid goes into the
[34:39.000 --> 34:45.040]  lungs and the body stops having the autoimmune response. But sure enough, since this got
[34:45.040 --> 34:50.920]  millions of views and went viral in the last day, now they have mainstream media coming
[34:50.920 --> 34:57.760]  out. COVID patients defend Dr. Bartlett's silver bullet medicine regime. But then they still
[34:57.760 --> 35:04.200]  go on to have, well, the NIH says only the UN is the boss and only what they say is approved.
[35:04.200 --> 35:10.560]  One of the Memorial hospitals says inhaled steroid is no silver bullet for COVID-19.
[35:10.560 --> 35:14.120]  They say there's not the UN saying it's certified, so that's not scientific. Well, what about
[35:14.120 --> 35:18.400]  it actually working? Like, do I need a science degree to know if a leg's chopped off and
[35:18.400 --> 35:22.840]  if I tie a tourniquet around it, it'll slow the blood flow? Do I need to know, without
[35:22.840 --> 35:28.040]  the UN saying so, that brushing my teeth is good or that eating my vegetables is good?
[35:28.040 --> 35:32.920]  They play this game. It's like a new Dark Ages. So here he is on the TV show, the full
[35:32.920 --> 35:36.200]  video. We've archived it, man.video, because I'm telling you, it's going to get pulled
[35:36.200 --> 35:41.760]  down. Right now, it's still posted at America Can We Talk. Dr. Richard Bartlett, here it
[35:41.760 --> 35:42.760]  is.
[35:42.760 --> 35:45.800]  So I mentioned at the start of the show, we have a guest joining us. This is kind of
[35:45.800 --> 35:49.720]  a funny thing. I'll just tell you a true story. So last night, there was a political event.
[35:49.720 --> 35:54.320]  I moderated a panel that was speaking at a political event. And afterward, I met someone
[35:54.320 --> 36:00.520]  who attended the event, is a doctor here in Texas and not in doubt in Midland, Texas.
[36:00.520 --> 36:07.200]  And he has been working also dealing with COVID-19 patients, coronavirus patients.
[36:07.200 --> 36:12.840]  The article is up again on our website, AmericaCanWeTalk.org. An article about him is called Local
[36:12.840 --> 36:17.920]  Doctor Believes He Has Found Silver Bullet for COVID-19. We had a great conversation
[36:17.920 --> 36:22.880]  after the meeting last night. And on the spot, I said, watch it, come on to my show tomorrow.
[36:22.880 --> 36:27.760]  And gratefully, he was available. So here you have, we have joined us in studio, our
[36:27.760 --> 36:30.400]  new friend, Dr. Richard Bartlett. Hello, sir.
[36:30.400 --> 36:32.360]  Hi, Debbie. I'm honored to be here. Thank you.
[36:32.360 --> 36:36.040]  I'm grateful you could be here. And I would love to just have you dive right in. Since
[36:36.040 --> 36:39.600]  I don't really know you, how do you start with telling our listeners about your medical
[36:39.600 --> 36:42.720]  background? Well, I've been practicing in Texas for 28
[36:42.720 --> 36:49.200]  years. When Governor Perry started a new task force called the Health Disparities Task Force,
[36:49.200 --> 36:54.640]  he asked me to be on that task force. And the purpose was to give him advice so that
[36:54.640 --> 36:59.840]  all Texans can have access to quality health care. And that was a two-year appointment
[36:59.840 --> 37:04.120]  after two years. He asked me, would you stay on one more year? And so that happened year
[37:04.120 --> 37:11.280]  after year for a total of seven years. And a lot of good things happened. But I also
[37:11.280 --> 37:16.160]  have been the medical expert for CBS affiliate in West Texas for over 20 years. And I do
[37:16.160 --> 37:23.960]  a regular weekly update on COVID on the talk 50, 5.50 a.m. talk radio in West Texas. And
[37:23.960 --> 37:26.200]  we've been doing that since the beginning of this drama.
[37:26.200 --> 37:31.840]  Wow. Okay. And so I'm also an author and do medical missions in other countries. And
[37:31.840 --> 37:36.960]  so I've seen a lot of disaster all over the world. But I want to say echo everything
[37:36.960 --> 37:42.920]  you said in your in your first five minutes, I agree 100%. There is, we already have an
[37:42.920 --> 37:50.280]  answer for this. And to put things in perspective, let's look around the world. You know, in
[37:50.280 --> 37:55.280]  the country of Taiwan, there's over 25 million people, they're stacked on top of each other.
[37:55.280 --> 37:59.200]  If they did social distancing, they'd be out in the ocean floating around. There's not
[37:59.200 --> 38:03.520]  enough room for them to do social distancing. But guess how many people have died to date
[38:03.520 --> 38:09.360]  during the whole pandemic in Taiwan? Seven as many people as you can stack in a minivan
[38:09.360 --> 38:15.240]  going down central expressway. And so the next time your viewers see a minivan think,
[38:15.240 --> 38:19.840]  Oh, that's how many people have died in a country of 24 million people. Now I'm going
[38:19.840 --> 38:25.000]  to tell you, yes, I'm going to tell you why that's the situation. It's the situation
[38:25.000 --> 38:31.040]  also in Japan, 121 million people in Japan. They've had less than 1000 people died during
[38:31.040 --> 38:35.920]  the whole pandemic. Singapore, only 12 people have died in the whole country during the
[38:35.920 --> 38:41.200]  whole pandemic. Iceland, well, that's not possible, according to what we're being told
[38:41.200 --> 38:45.320]  in the mainstream media. But that's reality. Anyone can look it up. You can even look at
[38:45.320 --> 38:50.680]  the Johns Hopkins COVID website and you'll see those numbers. They're hidden in there.
[38:50.680 --> 38:54.720]  But I'm pointing them out because that's key. We're going to come back next segment and
[38:54.720 --> 38:59.440]  play more where he gets into the one particular drug. But again, it's in all the literature
[38:59.440 --> 39:03.520]  that many mnemonials kill you not from the virus replicating and actually destroying
[39:03.520 --> 39:07.480]  the tissue, but your body has an autoimmune response. Those the ones you die of sometimes
[39:07.480 --> 39:14.880]  in 24, 48 hours, the lungs just expand with inflammation and you die. It's it's not not
[39:14.880 --> 39:20.400]  just the fluid. They just completely expand and shut down. And it's just mainline thousands
[39:20.400 --> 39:25.080]  of studies that when somebody's dying before they even put a ventilator on you, they will
[39:25.080 --> 39:31.320]  give you an anti inflammatory, but they don't want that discussed because they want have
[39:31.320 --> 39:35.320]  the problem never end. They want the panic, they want the fear, they want the tracking,
[39:35.320 --> 39:38.680]  they want the control to make you stay in your house, the force inoculations and the
[39:38.680 --> 39:43.200]  trillions they're going to make on the vaccines and expensive drugs that Fauci and Bill Gates
[39:43.200 --> 39:48.680]  openly are invested in with criminal conflict of interest in your face. We'll be right back
[39:48.680 --> 39:54.520]  to expose these murdering criminals. Stay with us.
[39:54.520 --> 40:01.320]  The fourth of July, 2020 special has gone into high gear. We have 50% off bodies, really

[40:52.160 --> 40:54.360]  support. Again, I salute you all.
[40:54.360 --> 41:00.200]  As we enter the critical months of July, it is very important for listeners and viewers
[41:00.200 --> 41:05.960]  to understand that all of the major storeable food companies have been sold out of food
[41:05.960 --> 41:12.120]  for months. My Patriot supply, our supplier was out to an eight week wait, not because
[41:12.120 --> 41:15.880]  they didn't have food, but because their four plants were backed up packaging and getting
[41:15.880 --> 41:22.040]  it out. Now, they are at three to four weeks right now. They've gotten over the hump. Their
[41:22.040 --> 41:27.120]  other competitors are completely sold out or selling old garbage. This is high quality
[41:27.120 --> 41:32.440]  food. I would advise everyone to do what I'm doing and buy more storeable food now before
[41:32.440 --> 41:37.640]  the next big hump comes because if you think things are about to settle down, think again.
[41:37.640 --> 41:41.680]  The world is only going to get more insane. I've been telling you this for six months.
[41:41.680 --> 41:44.440]  Ladies and gentlemen, if you don't have firearms and ammo and water filtration, you better
[41:44.440 --> 41:48.320]  get it. If you don't have storeable food, you better get it. Go to infowarstore.com to take

[42:54.560 --> 43:01.480]  2020 is a very special year to the globalist, to the occultist, to those that are into esoteric
[43:01.480 --> 43:05.360]  mysticism, and they believe this is the year they're going to totally overthrow America
[43:05.360 --> 43:11.080]  and the world and bring in their anti-God, anti-human tyranny. Well, we're here on air.
[43:11.080 --> 43:14.720]  We just ask you all to realize that we're in opposition to this evil, and that only
[43:14.720 --> 43:18.720]  your word of mouth helps us reach new people, and I want to salute you all and thank you
[43:18.720 --> 43:19.720]  for your support.

[43:59.200 --> 44:09.840]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[44:09.840 --> 44:16.240]  Waging war on corruption. It's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of
[44:16.240 --> 44:18.840]  the info war.
[44:18.840 --> 44:26.680]  So the next time your viewers see a minivan, think, oh, that's how many people have died
[44:26.680 --> 44:31.440]  in a country of 24 million people. Now I'm going to tell you, yes, I'm going to tell
[44:31.440 --> 44:38.960]  you why that's the situation. It's the situation also in Japan, 121 million people in Japan.
[44:38.960 --> 44:44.560]  They've had less than 1,000 people die during the whole pandemic. Singapore, only 12 people
[44:44.560 --> 44:49.840]  have died in the whole country during the whole pandemic. Iceland, well, that's not possible
[44:49.840 --> 44:53.760]  according to what we're being told in the mainstream media, but that's reality. Anyone
[44:53.760 --> 44:58.360]  can look it up. You can even look at the Johns Hopkins COVID website, and you'll see those
[44:58.360 --> 45:04.000]  numbers. They're hidden in there, but I'm pointing them out because the people in Texas
[45:04.000 --> 45:09.200]  need to hear good news. In Dallas, they need to hear good news, and I have good news.
[45:09.200 --> 45:13.680]  I'm sure you do. Before I'm blown away by those numbers, I gave up trying to write them
[45:13.680 --> 45:17.240]  down, but you're going to tell us somehow eventually where we get to this point that
[45:17.240 --> 45:21.720]  in these other countries, they're doing what I'm doing, Debbie. Okay, they're doing what
[45:21.720 --> 45:27.880]  I'm doing, which is not hydroxychloroquine, although that works. And so what they're doing
[45:27.880 --> 45:34.920]  is an inhaled steroid. And so my silver bullet is inhaled buidesynide. The brand name originally
[45:34.920 --> 45:39.600]  was PalmaCourt, now it's generic. It's super cheap. It's about $200 for the total treatment
[45:39.600 --> 45:44.720]  if you pay cash. With insurance, many of my patients are not even having to pay for it.
[45:44.720 --> 45:51.280]  And you use a nebulizer machine. It's an asthma medicine. It's a respiratory anti-inflammatory
[45:51.280 --> 45:58.160]  for COVID, which is a respiratory inflammatory disease. And it works 100% of my patients
[45:58.160 --> 46:04.520]  are alive. I've been treating this since March. And you use it for five minutes. So it takes
[46:04.520 --> 46:07.760]  five minutes to do a breathing treatment. You plug it in the machine, the machine in
[46:07.760 --> 46:12.440]  the wall, you put the medicine that's pre-mixed, pre-measured from the pharmacy into the little
[46:12.440 --> 46:17.200]  reservoir, you push the on button and you breathe it during five minutes. You don't
[46:17.200 --> 46:21.240]  even have to have a mask. You can use a little mouthpiece that you hold in front of you.
[46:21.240 --> 46:27.080]  Okay. And you breathe it for five minutes. And I have, let me tell you what I've heard
[46:27.080 --> 46:33.160]  from patients when I started using this. They tell me, I feel better during the first treatment.
[46:33.160 --> 46:38.480]  And so their chest pain goes away. Their shortness of breath goes away. Their fever breaks. I'll
[46:38.480 --> 46:44.800]  give you an example. I have a patient who has two kinds of cancer. She calls me after
[46:44.800 --> 46:49.600]  five days of being flat on her back in the house, in her house, in the bed, can't get
[46:49.600 --> 46:55.440]  out of bed. Fever won't break for five days. She says, I heard you on the radio. And would
[46:55.440 --> 47:00.360]  you please help me? It's on a Friday. She says, my granddaughter tested positive today.
[47:00.360 --> 47:04.920]  And I think I have it. And I said, I'm sure you do with all the symptoms you're describing.
[47:04.920 --> 47:11.480]  She is currently fighting two forms of lymphoma. She's on chemotherapy right now. She just
[47:11.480 --> 47:16.760]  had radiation a month before for the lymphoma. She should die according to what you hear
[47:16.760 --> 47:22.200]  from the CDC and World Health Organization. But I gave her that treatment that night in
[47:22.200 --> 47:26.320]  the morning. Her fever had broke. She had her first good night's sleep over the weekend.
[47:26.320 --> 47:31.760]  She recovers on Monday. She works an eight hour day. She still is fighting cancer, two
[47:31.760 --> 47:36.040]  forms of cancer, but she's cured of COVID. She's had, she's symptom free. She has her
[47:36.040 --> 47:41.360]  two consecutive negative tests. That's a cure. Okay. Can you say the name of the drug again?
[47:41.360 --> 47:47.360]  Udesanide. Udesanide. And so is it done in an inhaler? It's an inhaler. And so it does
[47:47.360 --> 47:51.360]  actually come as an inhaler, but I'm using it in a nebulizer machine. You know, you see
[47:51.360 --> 47:57.680]  pre-school kids use this. It's safe that it is so safe. It's been out for over 20 years.
[47:57.680 --> 48:03.360]  It's been used on two pound premature babies safely without batting an eye and the fragile
[48:03.360 --> 48:09.400]  elderly in nursing homes for over 20 years. There's no reservations with it. It doesn't
[48:09.400 --> 48:17.400]  cause any cardiac risk. Like the, the accusation of hydroxychloroquine is a risk of heart trouble.
[48:17.400 --> 48:22.600]  Although that's ridiculous to make that accusation. This one doesn't even have that risk. And
[48:22.600 --> 48:27.920]  so I give that an antibiotic to protect from secondary bacterial pneumonia, but let's talk
[48:27.920 --> 48:33.440]  about what COVID is. It's a respiratory virus that goes into the lungs, binds to ACE receptors
[48:33.440 --> 48:38.000]  in the lungs, and that triggers the release of inflammatory chemicals. And we call it
[48:38.000 --> 48:43.280]  a cytokine storm. That's a fancy word for inflammatory chemicals and enzymes that are
[48:43.280 --> 48:48.960]  released total body. And so with COVID, we have a killer that's never been around before.
[48:48.960 --> 48:54.920]  It is killing some people if they're not treated. And so they're for 50% of the people, they
[48:54.920 --> 48:59.840]  get it and they don't even know they had it. 50% of the people don't even know. But for
[48:59.840 --> 49:05.400]  the 20% that are at risk, there are treatments. We already have an answer. Let me tell you,
[49:05.400 --> 49:10.320]  you're right. Taiwan, 24 million people, they don't need to wait for a vaccine. They don't
[49:10.320 --> 49:14.280]  have a problem that you should vaccinate 24 million people for. They only had seven died
[49:14.280 --> 49:19.280]  during the whole pandemic. We have some treatment plans and options that are already valid and
[49:19.280 --> 49:20.280]  working.
[49:20.280 --> 49:24.840]  Okay. I, this is truly, it is great news. As you said before you went on break, great
[49:24.840 --> 49:29.600]  news. So you've been using this since early March. Roughly speaking, how many patients
[49:29.600 --> 49:37.320]  you, thank you. I'm getting calls every day. I have new five new patients today. And so
[49:37.320 --> 49:41.400]  I haven't even tallied the numbers, but every one of them is living, not dying. I'll give
[49:41.400 --> 49:47.280]  you another example. A lady who, an elderly lady who has a 50 year history of smoking
[49:47.280 --> 49:52.720]  and she had her chest cracked and had four vessel bypass surgery. She's on medicine for
[49:52.720 --> 49:57.720]  high blood pressure and thyroid disease. She calls me after five days of fever and shortness
[49:57.720 --> 50:02.240]  of breath and chest pain. She feels like she can barely get across the room. I started
[50:02.240 --> 50:06.800]  her on the treatment with the first treatment. She tells me again, something I have never
[50:06.800 --> 50:12.720]  heard with this medicine until COVID-19. She says, I feel better during the first treatment
[50:12.720 --> 50:17.480]  and she's cured with two double negatives after, after the fact. She's so grateful,
[50:17.480 --> 50:22.080]  but with this medicine that's been out for over 20 years, there's lots of research on
[50:22.080 --> 50:26.320]  it is safe. Big Pharma is not going to make a dime off it. Nobody's going to make any
[50:26.320 --> 50:34.360]  money. It's $200 for the total treatment versus the, the experimental antiviral that you have
[50:34.360 --> 50:39.680]  to be put in the hospital and then be a part of an experiment to get that costs over $3,100
[50:39.680 --> 50:40.680]  just for the medicine.
[50:40.680 --> 50:45.520]  Let's stop right there. That's with Desivir that Fauci owns part of and he did a fake
[50:45.520 --> 50:50.080]  study. Fauci study's been proving me a fraud that it helped people 8% more, but other
[50:50.080 --> 50:54.160]  studies show it kills you. That's why they don't want hydroxychloroquine because it works
[50:54.160 --> 51:08.600]  really good. But the studies with this, it's basically 100% with butycinide, B-E-W-D-E-H-S-O-N-I-D-E,
[51:08.600 --> 51:17.720]  butycinide. Now the full video is at band.video. It's the featured video. It's a mega red alert.
[51:17.720 --> 51:24.560]  I shot the video last night with the intro to it. Only has 114,000 views. Okay. It needs
[51:24.560 --> 51:29.400]  10 million views and I guarantee you it's on YouTube right now. The million views been
[51:29.400 --> 51:34.560]  up for two days. They will pull it. They've already got the Texas media attacking him.
[51:34.560 --> 51:39.140]  They went and found his patients. And one headline is doctor claims to have cured it
[51:39.140 --> 51:44.400]  after only treating five patients successfully. He said, I just treated five the other day
[51:44.400 --> 51:52.760]  in one day. Every day since March, I can't tell you how many we've helped. They turned
[51:52.760 --> 51:58.560]  that into he only helped five people. There are enemies. They're owned by big pharma.
[51:58.560 --> 52:03.040]  They're owned by the big mega banks. They're all lockstep. That's the Rockefeller plan
[52:03.040 --> 52:10.080]  called lockstep together to force evil upon us and our families and to not let us know
[52:10.080 --> 52:17.800]  about zinc or about vitamin C or about vitamin D three or vitamin K. You've got to have it
[52:17.800 --> 52:23.440]  or yourselves fall to any virus. A regular coronavirus will kill you dead in a hammer.
[52:23.440 --> 52:27.800]  If you don't have vitamin D three and zinc, you die. That's why they're called essential,
[52:27.800 --> 52:35.520]  essential. The NIH website says under vitamin D three under zinc, they're antiviral. You
[52:35.520 --> 52:39.520]  must have them for cellular operation. If you do not have them at a certain level, you
[52:39.520 --> 52:44.680]  will go deficient and you will end up dying from a viral infection. It says it on the
[52:44.680 --> 52:50.840]  NIH website and I literally have friends and family and I know lawyers and I know insurance
[52:50.840 --> 52:56.200]  sales people that go Jones. Are you claiming really vitamins will protect me? Yeah, dumb
[52:56.200 --> 53:05.160]  asses. Just like drinking water will protect you from dying of first your morons. I drove
[53:05.160 --> 53:12.280]  to work today and I'm not exaggerating. There was almost no one on the road, but idiots
[53:12.280 --> 53:16.480]  driving in the fast lane below the speed limit are at it because they think the left lane
[53:16.480 --> 53:21.880]  is an open lane. There were old people. There were black people. There were brown people.
[53:21.880 --> 53:28.560]  There were women. It was all colors of idiots. These people are idiots, idiots, idiots.
[53:28.560 --> 53:33.160]  My God, what is wrong with people? They're superstitious of knowledge. They're superstitious
[53:33.160 --> 53:38.280]  of being informed. They think I'm weird because I study stuff and no things and I've trained
[53:38.280 --> 53:44.480]  my mind to one information. Everything that Dr. saying is true and the criminal media,
[53:44.480 --> 53:49.920]  there's hundreds of articles attacking him and lying about him because they've been
[53:49.920 --> 53:57.080]  ordered to to keep people scared to keep the lockdown going forever over my dead body gates.
[53:57.080 --> 54:00.720]  I'm not taking your vaccine. I'm not putting up with your mark of the beast, your digital
[54:00.720 --> 54:06.360]  marketing. I'm just telling listeners. Tell folks about this live show. Tell them about
[54:06.360 --> 54:13.680]  the video. It's on info wars, on news wars and share it.
[54:13.680 --> 54:19.040]  Override these murdering maggots. Is that lady gone to the wrong doctor? He just shoved
[54:19.040 --> 54:23.800]  an innovator down her throat. He'd kill that old woman just like you'd run over a squirrel
[54:23.800 --> 54:28.120]  and I'd give a damn. In fact, they're the types that run into a squirrel on purpose.
[54:28.120 --> 54:34.720]  Murderers, we're going to get you. Start acting like you should with murdering criminals
[54:34.720 --> 54:40.120]  censoring you. You're not going to murder us anymore. You're going to get it. You murdering
[54:40.120 --> 54:44.600]  maggot killer.
[54:44.600 --> 54:51.400]  The fourth of July 2020 special has gone into high gear. We have 50% off bodies, really

[55:24.800 --> 55:28.160]  us. I want to invite you to take advantage of these great deals and great products that
[55:28.160 --> 55:34.320]  enrich yourself and your family's life and also fund hard core truth. Again, take action.
[55:34.320 --> 55:39.200]  Big 4th of July sales right now at infowarsstore.com. We could not have done this without you. I
[55:39.200 --> 55:43.920]  thank you for your continued prayer, your focus and your support. Again, I salute you
[55:43.920 --> 55:45.600]  all.
[55:45.600 --> 55:51.560]  We were told by the United Nations. We were told by the CDC and Fauci that two plus million
[55:51.560 --> 55:57.560]  Americans would die. That millions of Europeans would die. We did not do exactly as they said.
[55:57.560 --> 56:02.920]  And it turned out it was all frauds. The models, the testing, taking regular depths and putting
[56:02.920 --> 56:07.480]  it in the COVID-19 column. All a complete criminal fraud. But none of them are getting
[56:07.480 --> 56:11.720]  sued. None of them are getting prosecuted. None of them are getting in trouble except
[56:11.720 --> 56:16.680]  for Bill Gates, the FDA shut down his factories that are making fake COVID tests that show
[56:16.680 --> 56:22.040]  everyone is positive. And despite that, there's still testing record numbers of people creating
[56:22.040 --> 56:27.320]  hysteria and saying the numbers spiking and why it'll be 200,000 dead by the election.
[56:27.320 --> 56:32.680]  And it's all Trump's fault. And now, oh, China had 40 cases in one city. We got to lock down
[56:32.680 --> 56:37.160]  again. Everything's over. This, ladies and gentlemen, is the new order teaching us to
[56:37.160 --> 56:47.160]  be total prisoners. Either we expose the COVID hopes, we're all permanently enslaved by it. Your choice.
[56:48.440 --> 56:51.160]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[56:51.160 --> 57:11.160]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance. You're listening to Alex Jones.
[57:11.160 --> 57:23.160]  It's $200 for the total treatment versus the experimental antiviral that you have to be
[57:23.160 --> 57:28.200]  put in the hospital and then be a part of an experiment to get that costs over $3,100 just
[57:28.200 --> 57:36.120]  for the medicine. And then you pay for $15,000 at least to be in the hospital during that time.
[57:36.120 --> 57:41.080]  Unless you go to the ICU and then you'll get $30 or $40,000 bill on top of being sick.
[57:41.080 --> 57:46.040]  So this is a medication you prescribed before COVID ever came along for our patients for asthma?
[57:46.040 --> 57:52.360]  For asthma prevention. You know, there's 25 million people in America that have asthma.
[57:52.360 --> 57:59.000]  And so this medicine is used routinely for over 20 years to prevent asthma attacks. It's the first
[57:59.000 --> 58:03.800]  line preventive measure to protect people from having an asthma attack is an inhaled steroid.
[58:03.800 --> 58:07.640]  And so that's what they're doing in Japan. That's what they're doing in Taiwan.
[58:07.640 --> 58:10.920]  That's what they're doing in Singapore. So even healthy people over there?
[58:10.920 --> 58:18.120]  Yes. With COVID, they're treating with inhaled steroids if they get COVID. So,
[58:18.120 --> 58:21.640]  you know, for the 50% of the people who are going to get it and never have symptoms,
[58:21.640 --> 58:27.480]  they don't need medicine. They certainly don't need a vaccine. But for the 20% that are at risk
[58:27.480 --> 58:32.520]  of death, if they don't get treated, we have an answer. And here's what we need to do, early
[58:32.520 --> 58:38.200]  treatment, early testing, early treatment. We need to detect it early. For every disease, Debbie,
[58:40.120 --> 58:45.720]  America has the best healthcare system. And we do early detection and early treatment for cancer,
[58:45.720 --> 58:51.400]  for heart disease, for stroke, for all kinds of infections. But this is crazy that we're doing
[58:51.400 --> 58:56.040]  what Communist China is doing. And we're parroting that through the World Health Organization.
[58:56.760 --> 59:01.560]  And then the World Health Organization is praising what China did. And so
[59:01.560 --> 59:07.400]  Italy follows that, follows suit. And look what Italy, over 30,000 people died in Italy so far,
[59:07.400 --> 59:12.840]  versus seven in a country that people are stacked on top of each other, 24 million.
[59:13.400 --> 59:18.200]  And what Dr. Richard Bartlett is saying is, is all completely correct, except he's being such a
[59:18.200 --> 59:23.720]  nice guy is like, let's get early testing. But then those are false positives. So that drives
[59:23.720 --> 59:28.600]  up the fear. And then doctors that aren't informed like him or who are evil, but these evil, you
[59:28.600 --> 59:32.920]  know, big conglomerates that get $52,000 every person they end up saying as COVID and putting a
[59:32.920 --> 59:38.760]  tube down their throat, they will grab them and intubate them. And then you're going to get a
[59:38.760 --> 59:42.920]  death. So that's the one problem. Because I guarantee you, this guy's a goody-tooth shoe,
[59:43.720 --> 59:47.960]  guarantees an Eagle Scout, guaranteed you could, this guy's, you can totally trust this doctor.
[59:47.960 --> 59:52.280]  He just comes off good, decent, nice guy, like, you know, my dad is a doctor or any of these
[59:52.280 --> 59:59.240]  nice doctors. And so we then all think all the other healthcare providers are like Dr. Richard
[59:59.240 --> 1:00:07.000]  Bartlett. No, no, they're like Governor Northam. A lot of them are like Governor Northam. And so
[1:00:07.800 --> 1:00:11.800]  you notice Governor Northam's up there saying hydroxychloroquine's bad. There's no hope
[1:00:11.800 --> 1:00:16.280]  only the vaccine because they know their job with the big cartels.
[1:00:16.280 --> 1:00:22.920]  All right, I got something really powerful coming up next segment. We've got Roger Stone
[1:00:22.920 --> 1:00:26.600]  bottom of the hour. And I've got all this COVID-19 news I haven't hit. You know, they're doing door
[1:00:26.600 --> 1:00:29.880]  to door lockdowns and public housings where they'll always start with dependent people.
[1:00:30.600 --> 1:00:37.480]  And they're starting forced COVID testing. So see, then that's all you and recommended,
[1:00:37.480 --> 1:00:41.240]  that's all you and Ryan, that's what the UN called for is taking your kids away.
[1:00:41.240 --> 1:00:45.800]  If you test positive, but they don't, you're totally healthy, but we're going to take your kid
[1:00:45.800 --> 1:00:49.560]  away. This is just getting you used to contact tracers, coming to your house, taking you away.
[1:00:51.160 --> 1:00:56.360]  That is coming up as well. Yes, you just heard me. This is breaking ABC news out of Australia.
[1:00:57.400 --> 1:01:01.160]  Absolutely insane. But they put it out like it's a good thing. And then separately,
[1:01:01.160 --> 1:01:04.200]  I didn't plug last hour. I really need to. We have store wide free shipping,
[1:01:04.760 --> 1:01:10.600]  double Patriot points, but 60% off on our best sellers. The sale has to end this weekend.
[1:01:10.600 --> 1:01:13.720]  Because a lot of these things are going to sell because we got limited amounts of them because
[1:01:13.720 --> 1:01:18.680]  the supply chain's breaking down. That's what's scary. We'll be like, we want 10,000 bottles of
[1:01:18.680 --> 1:01:22.600]  bodies. Sorry of the high quality turmeric you're getting in the supply chain. We've only got enough
[1:01:22.600 --> 1:01:26.680]  for 3000 bottles. And I'm like, well, that'll sell out in a few months. We won't have it. I mean,
[1:01:26.680 --> 1:01:31.320]  that's why so many things you like to buy are gone because we just can't get them at the quality
[1:01:31.320 --> 1:01:36.200]  that we get them from the sources. We get it. I mean, this is crazy. So if you want your ultra 12,
[1:01:36.200 --> 1:01:40.040]  your bodies, you want your winter sun, you want your DNA force, your bazo beach,
[1:01:40.040 --> 1:01:44.920]  your fundamental fusion at 50 to 60% off store wide free shipping, double Patriot points.
[1:01:44.920 --> 1:01:49.480]  Now's the time to get these and support the info war. But things are breaking down folks.
[1:01:49.480 --> 1:01:52.120]  The global depression is here brought to you by the COVID folks.
[1:01:53.320 --> 1:01:59.560]  The stars are saying what I was privately saying of the crew last night. We may have just broken
[1:01:59.560 --> 1:02:04.840]  not just the biggest story in info war history, but one of the biggest stories period. The state
[1:02:04.840 --> 1:02:12.760]  of Texas confirms that the CDC and NIH have created a system where anyone that has the
[1:02:12.760 --> 1:02:19.560]  sore throat or a runny nose or who has been in contact with someone COVID-19 is then added
[1:02:19.560 --> 1:02:25.880]  into the database as having a case and is counted as a case of COVID-19. It's in the NIH documents.
[1:02:25.880 --> 1:02:30.200]  It's at the state level. We confirmed it in Texas. We're now confirming it's in other states. This
[1:02:30.200 --> 1:02:35.400]  is beyond the other smoking guns of them putting people to die gunshot wounds and stuff in the
[1:02:35.400 --> 1:02:42.920]  COVID column and the false positive test. That's all huge. This is beyond that mega criminal activity.
[1:02:43.560 --> 1:02:47.560]  And we've got these different county commission videos where they're just freaking out over it
[1:02:47.560 --> 1:03:03.480]  saying what in the world is this? The full video is supposed to be banned on video. Get it out and expose the hoax.
[1:03:11.000 --> 1:03:16.840]  Ladies and gentlemen, I just got hit about 10 minutes ago and I'm trying to process it right
[1:03:16.840 --> 1:03:21.560]  now. We'll cover the next segment. We're getting the video right now. From ABC News, that's the
[1:03:21.560 --> 1:03:27.480]  Australian Broadcasting Company, where they are doing house to house forced COVID testing.
[1:03:28.040 --> 1:03:34.440]  And just like the UN director said, if you test positive but your kids don't, we're going to take
[1:03:34.440 --> 1:03:39.880]  your kids from you. In fact, grab that clip too if you guys can. A UN official says we'll take
[1:03:39.880 --> 1:03:44.920]  your children. And you hear all this six months ago, five months ago, four months ago, three months
[1:03:44.920 --> 1:03:49.320]  ago, two months ago. This is a rollout. And they said there will need to be more lockdowns.
[1:03:50.120 --> 1:03:55.160]  You'll need to have an ID and then a tracker system on your phone that allows you to travel.
[1:03:55.160 --> 1:03:59.880]  And you're going to need to take this vaccine and others and more bad things are coming.
[1:04:01.160 --> 1:04:05.640]  So they're teaching you now that bad viruses are going to be here. You've got to be tested.
[1:04:05.640 --> 1:04:09.640]  You've got to be given all these shots. They suppress the real information about the virus.
[1:04:09.640 --> 1:04:18.440]  They over blow its severity in its numbers. They lie about the system through the test
[1:04:18.440 --> 1:04:24.760]  that show all the false positives. They send people that have pneumonia and flus into nursing homes
[1:04:24.760 --> 1:04:30.200]  in blue states and in Italy to get rid of the old people. And they admit this is about culling
[1:04:30.200 --> 1:04:33.640]  the earth. This is about lowering the carbon footprint. This is about getting rid of the
[1:04:33.640 --> 1:04:38.520]  western civilization. And they're using it to then launch the riots worldwide at the same time
[1:04:38.520 --> 1:04:47.160]  to bring down the first world, bankrupt the third world, then have the UN control the migrant flows
[1:04:47.160 --> 1:04:52.200]  taking over the west. And the UN announced this again a week ago about replacement migration.
[1:04:52.200 --> 1:04:57.480]  They said due to the COVID, hoax they created and the panic they created, the depression with
[1:04:57.480 --> 1:05:01.160]  the shutdown they created, we're going to have to open our borders to the refugees now.
[1:05:01.160 --> 1:05:06.920]  And the Democrats have put it in their platform to do just that.
[1:05:08.600 --> 1:05:15.080]  The 2020 Democrat platform. I have all those news articles. Dan Lyman of europewars.com who lives
[1:05:15.080 --> 1:05:20.280]  in Europe, works with info wars. He is here visiting while his wife visits family, while he
[1:05:20.280 --> 1:05:26.760]  visits family. And he is going to be in studio with us to chronicle replacement migration now
[1:05:26.760 --> 1:05:31.400]  officially on the Democratic Party platform. Sasha Barrack Cohen and the ADL say if you talk
[1:05:31.400 --> 1:05:38.200]  about it, you will be de-platformed and they said next phase, arrested. It's public, but the ADL says
[1:05:38.200 --> 1:05:42.200]  you will be arrested. That's why you're now hearing if you criticize Black Lives Matter,
[1:05:42.200 --> 1:05:47.880]  you'll be arrested. This is a Soviet style takeover. The communists using COVID-19 have now
[1:05:47.880 --> 1:05:52.520]  taken over Hong Kong are saying the same thing, criticize a list of things they list, you'll be
[1:05:52.520 --> 1:05:57.080]  arrested. It's not even as strong as what the left says here. So it's blue cities, blue states,
[1:05:57.080 --> 1:06:02.120]  the Democrats, big corporations all ganged up on what's left of America and the president and the
[1:06:02.120 --> 1:06:08.360]  people in the family. So it's all coming up, ladies and gentlemen. I'm just speechless right now.
[1:06:10.440 --> 1:06:15.960]  It's just unbelievable. But we also have to have a little fun in the information war, don't we?
[1:06:15.960 --> 1:06:19.800]  And reach out to people that aren't as awake. And the way to do that is with entertainment.
[1:06:19.800 --> 1:06:25.800]  And one of the most memed things is Lord of the Rings. Well, Rob Do has spent a little too much
[1:06:25.800 --> 1:06:30.760]  time on this, but it is good. I hope it goes viral. New Joe Biden campaign ad shocks the world.
[1:06:31.640 --> 1:06:37.480]  CNN will probably say, Jones said it was real, but it wasn't. It shows the Easter Bunny on its face.
[1:06:37.480 --> 1:06:42.840]  It's a joke. Share this video to fight back against internet censorship and stop the enemies of the
[1:06:42.840 --> 1:06:48.680]  republic. So Biden campaign releases their most powerful campaign message ever. You can get it
[1:06:48.680 --> 1:06:54.280]  at band.video and find it at info wars.com or news wars.com. Please tweet it, Facebook it,
[1:06:54.280 --> 1:06:59.160]  email it out, text message it out to everybody and say, check out Joe Biden's new campaign
[1:06:59.880 --> 1:07:05.160]  commercial that's shocking the world. Haha. But nevertheless, here it is. It just gets better
[1:07:05.160 --> 1:07:09.160]  and better throughout the piece. It's not really for radio. So I'll narrate some. Here it is.
[1:07:09.160 --> 1:07:16.680]  The power of Isengard is at your command.
[1:07:17.960 --> 1:07:25.880]  Ask them, warrior. Build me a army worthy of your door.
[1:07:32.360 --> 1:07:36.840]  What orders from Lord, oh my lord? What does the high command?
[1:07:36.840 --> 1:07:39.000]  What? We have work to do.
[1:07:41.800 --> 1:07:45.880]  The trees are strong, my lord. Their roots go deep.
[1:07:47.080 --> 1:07:48.360]  Rep them all, darling.
[1:07:48.360 --> 1:08:18.200]  The world is changing. Who now has the strength
[1:08:18.200 --> 1:08:23.720]  to stand against the armies of Isengard and Mordor?
[1:08:27.400 --> 1:08:31.800]  Stand against the might of Sauron and Saruman?
[1:08:31.800 --> 1:08:49.320]  Together, my lord, Sauron, we shall rule this middle of us.
[1:09:02.360 --> 1:09:10.520]  The old world will burn in the pious industry. The forests will fall.
[1:09:10.520 --> 1:09:30.040]  A new order will rise in a war with the sword and the spear and the iron fist of the Horde.
[1:09:40.520 --> 1:09:56.680]  I want them armed and ready to march within two weeks.
[1:09:56.680 --> 1:10:01.800]  But my lord, there are too many. They cannot all be armed in time. We don't have the means.
[1:10:01.800 --> 1:10:04.760]  Build a dam, block the stream, work the furnaces like day.
[1:10:05.640 --> 1:10:07.640]  We don't have enough fuel to beat the fires.
[1:10:07.640 --> 1:10:15.480]  The forest of Fungorn lies on our doorstep. Burn it.
[1:10:25.080 --> 1:10:28.200]  We need a revolution in order to overthrow this system,
[1:10:28.200 --> 1:10:34.440]  bring a whole new communist world into being that can actually ensure the rights of black and brown people.
[1:10:34.440 --> 1:10:41.320]  We must begin the work of dismantling the whole system of oppression wherever we find it.
[1:10:41.320 --> 1:10:43.560]  I'm Joe Biden and I approve this message.
[1:10:50.120 --> 1:10:55.720]  And it ends with them burning American flags all over the United States. The media saying it's good.
[1:10:55.720 --> 1:11:02.680]  New Joe Biden campaign ads shocks the world. This went live at man.video. I hope that you share it
[1:11:02.680 --> 1:11:05.080]  with everyone you know. Now, this is going to get really serious.
[1:11:05.720 --> 1:11:09.480]  You've heard a bunch of UN high-level officials and now you've heard in the U.S.
[1:11:09.480 --> 1:11:13.400]  and you've seen Democrats say this like light foot in Chicago.
[1:11:14.040 --> 1:11:18.360]  We're going to have to go into the houses door to door and test and see who has it inside.
[1:11:19.560 --> 1:11:24.120]  See, that's the next phase we're going into. And the Clinton initiative runs it
[1:11:24.120 --> 1:11:28.440]  and is reaching out to the Obama initiative and to Obama Corp.
[1:11:28.440 --> 1:11:34.440]  And all those groups will be run by the Peace Corps. And they're now going to come to your house.
[1:11:34.440 --> 1:11:37.560]  And look, we're just here to test you. We've got your name. We've got your info.
[1:11:38.120 --> 1:11:42.840]  And then the image of, you know, taking the people away to quarantine that habit,
[1:11:42.840 --> 1:11:46.600]  those that don't. And all of its false positive garbage, all of its lies.
[1:11:46.600 --> 1:11:53.160]  And then once they've got you in a facility, they're going to be like, you've got COVID.
[1:11:53.160 --> 1:11:55.400]  We're going to, they scrap you down and just, we're liberal.
[1:11:55.400 --> 1:11:59.240]  Ah, just like the Communist Chinese are known for saying you have a
[1:11:59.800 --> 1:12:03.480]  respiratory illness and they kill you by putting a tube down your throat and blowing your lungs.
[1:12:04.360 --> 1:12:08.200]  Or they'll say you haven't been eating properly. So they pump food into your stomach till it
[1:12:08.200 --> 1:12:12.840]  explodes and they're going to be good little liberals. And most of them aren't even really
[1:12:12.840 --> 1:12:16.920]  evil. They're such cult members. They're like, there's a lot of bad people that are insane
[1:12:16.920 --> 1:12:22.120]  and don't trust us. And that's why they say, be tough. Wear your mask. Come on. It's no big deal
[1:12:22.120 --> 1:12:27.880]  because that shows everyone bowing down. That shows everyone submitting. So now you'll submit
[1:12:27.880 --> 1:12:33.240]  the force testing, the forced lock downs, the forced arrest, your children being taken. It's
[1:12:33.240 --> 1:12:38.440]  all coming. And you did such a good job. You already put up with 70,000 old people in the
[1:12:38.440 --> 1:12:42.760]  nursing homes, locked down and killed. And their families unable to go see them. You already did
[1:12:42.760 --> 1:12:48.920]  a good job. So now you're going to die. They're coming. They're going to kill you. And the governor
[1:12:48.920 --> 1:12:54.680]  of Texas is going to help them. When I thank the listeners of this broadcast, I'm not patting you
[1:12:54.680 --> 1:13:01.160]  on the head. I'm like a person that's been thrown overboard who finds a life raft to get on, or
[1:13:01.160 --> 1:13:06.200]  a piece of driftwood. I am clinging to you. So when you call the show and thank me, listen,
[1:13:06.200 --> 1:13:10.760]  I'm thanking you too. We are in this together. Now I try to bring you things that I know are
[1:13:10.760 --> 1:13:14.680]  amazing that have helped me and my family. So you get a great response. You order it again.
[1:13:14.680 --> 1:13:20.120]  I treat you like I want to be treated. It's not a science. It's not a plan. It's just the way to do

[1:14:46.600 --> 1:15:13.400]  your continued prayer, your focus and your support. Again, I salute you all. Welcome back. We are
[1:15:13.400 --> 1:15:18.040]  the frontline of resisting the globalist takeover. We're in the middle of a worldwide corporate
[1:15:18.040 --> 1:15:22.440]  takeover through the United Nations. You didn't think that these big mega corporations will hit
[1:15:22.440 --> 1:15:27.000]  you with tanks and militaries. No, they know people will resist that. They hit you with medical tyranny
[1:15:27.560 --> 1:15:34.440]  and a synthetic virus they've released that will infect everyone that is a cold virus
[1:15:35.400 --> 1:15:40.360]  and that shows mainly false positives so you can become a suspect. And then as you're quote
[1:15:40.360 --> 1:15:45.160]  reinfected with new colds, they will always say you still have COVID and have to take all these
[1:15:45.160 --> 1:15:49.640]  forced inoculations, have apps that track you, all of it directed by the United Nations.
[1:15:51.080 --> 1:15:56.600]  Now, the UN director of the World Health Organization emergency programs, that means
[1:15:56.600 --> 1:16:04.760]  their takeover, their offensive general, the guy that leads the landing parties, Dr. Michael Ryan
[1:16:04.760 --> 1:16:09.240]  said months ago, but they've all been saying it. But after he said it, suddenly mayors and
[1:16:09.240 --> 1:16:15.560]  governors in blue cities, blue states began parroting it like mockingbirds that, oh, we need to go in
[1:16:15.560 --> 1:16:23.320]  your houses and forcibly test you. And then whoever's test positive in an antibody test, that
[1:16:23.320 --> 1:16:29.000]  means you're actually over it. They don't care. You get taken to a facility and it just gets you
[1:16:29.000 --> 1:16:34.440]  used to a van shows up. There's bureaucrats there with the Clinton global initiative on record runs
[1:16:34.440 --> 1:16:39.720]  it. They're paid money. The Clintons make billions. And if you don't do what they say, they get on
[1:16:39.720 --> 1:16:44.280]  the phone and here come the police. And then when they arrest you or kill you, oh, the cops did a
[1:16:44.280 --> 1:16:48.760]  good job. You want a black cop eats up a black guy or kills a black guy who didn't wear a mask.
[1:16:48.760 --> 1:16:55.640]  That's okay. Or you're a white guy, whatever. There's no police brutality was that when you
[1:16:55.640 --> 1:17:01.240]  don't want to be whisk away. So he was talking about this months ago. Now Australia is actually
[1:17:01.240 --> 1:17:06.760]  doing it. All of this is a formula. Whatever the UN says is a rollout. They had to get you first
[1:17:06.760 --> 1:17:11.560]  to say stay in 15 days. Then it was a couple months, three months. Then they got to get you
[1:17:11.560 --> 1:17:15.000]  used to wearing the mask to submit. Then it's going to be the medical ID. It's going to be the
[1:17:15.000 --> 1:17:21.000]  tracker app. All of it's been announced and then lockdowns of whole cities. Australia is
[1:17:21.000 --> 1:17:26.360]  announcing the lockdown of whole cities. And they started unannounced. The police are downstairs.
[1:17:26.360 --> 1:17:31.720]  They started with apartment towers. You may not leave. And we're forcibly testing all of you.
[1:17:32.280 --> 1:17:37.080]  So they hold you hostage under UN orders. It's all directive. It's a formula. So it's coming here.
[1:17:37.960 --> 1:17:41.560]  Just like the sun comes up, you know, the sun's up on the other side of the world at night. And
[1:17:41.560 --> 1:17:46.680]  then when it's dark over there, it comes up here. It's coming here, coming to a town near you.
[1:17:47.880 --> 1:17:52.680]  And they're going to start with the big leftist controlled apartment towers. Perfect prisons.
[1:17:52.680 --> 1:18:01.320]  They lock it down. And they say, you can come out once we come in door to door the next week.
[1:18:01.320 --> 1:18:05.720]  They've told them you're locked in for weeks. Once we get you cleared and tested,
[1:18:05.720 --> 1:18:11.160]  those that aren't clear are going to be taken away. Those that aren't clear, you can stay for now.
[1:18:13.240 --> 1:18:20.520]  And the media is like, oh, the people want more. And the article is like, we want more of this.
[1:18:20.520 --> 1:18:24.360]  Whoa. Oh, just locking me down for weeks is too much. Can you test me now?
[1:18:25.960 --> 1:18:31.880]  It's all psychologically wargamed. And these victims just, just like run into the pits.
[1:18:32.520 --> 1:18:35.320]  Like when the Nazis would shoot a group of people and then order the next group to run
[1:18:35.320 --> 1:18:38.440]  into the pit, they're like, yes, sir, let me do that. Well, I'm not doing it.
[1:18:39.560 --> 1:18:43.160]  And the good news is sheriff's departments, the police departments are waking up. A lot of states
[1:18:43.160 --> 1:18:49.800]  are waking up. Every Republican governor said no, except Santa Ana, the emperor of Texas,
[1:18:49.800 --> 1:18:54.760]  Governor Greg Abbott. Very sad to say it. He's fallen to Mordor. He's knelt to Satan.
[1:18:54.760 --> 1:19:00.840]  But here is the UN director of offensive emergency medical operations who codified the plan with
[1:19:00.840 --> 1:19:06.280]  China. Here he is telling you, we're coming to take your kids. Here it is. And at the moment,
[1:19:06.280 --> 1:19:11.720]  in most parts of the world, due to lockdown, most of the transmission that's actually happening in
[1:19:11.720 --> 1:19:17.800]  many countries now is happening in the household, at family level. In some senses, transmission
[1:19:17.800 --> 1:19:25.000]  has been taken off the streets and pushed back into family units. Now we need to go and look
[1:19:25.000 --> 1:19:31.640]  in families to find those people who may be sick and remove them and isolate them in a safe and
[1:19:31.640 --> 1:19:35.960]  dignified manner. And they went on to say, particularly children, a safe and dignified
[1:19:35.960 --> 1:19:40.440]  manner, keep them comfortable. Always get the family, always get rid of the nuclear family,
[1:19:40.440 --> 1:19:45.000]  official UN policy, that family, that family, that family, that family, that family,
[1:19:45.000 --> 1:19:49.080]  that family. What a shameful Irishman you are. Look what you've turned into, you monster.
[1:19:49.800 --> 1:19:56.200]  Let's go ahead now and go to Australia at the test site where they have become locking down the
[1:19:56.200 --> 1:20:01.720]  20 and 30 story towers. And they just roll it out like it's always just woke up and we're locked
[1:20:01.720 --> 1:20:07.880]  down until the testing. Here it is. We're in complete lockdown as in we can't go out for exercise,
[1:20:07.880 --> 1:20:14.120]  can't go out for work, we can't go get groceries and any essential either. You can see police
[1:20:14.120 --> 1:20:20.120]  presence on every access point. I haven't stepped outside not for a second. I opened my door just
[1:20:20.120 --> 1:20:24.120]  to look at some of the food that was dropped to me. You can see this is the food that has been
[1:20:25.800 --> 1:20:32.440]  came around 2 a.m. last night. No one expected for someone to go on lockdown, you know, especially
[1:20:32.440 --> 1:20:37.640]  in Australia. We didn't expect that. But you know, obviously there's members of the community who
[1:20:37.640 --> 1:20:42.520]  couldn't understand that, why is it happening to us? You know, are we different? Do we happen
[1:20:42.520 --> 1:20:47.240]  to be a different class of people? At the same time, you know, I really completely understand
[1:20:47.240 --> 1:20:53.000]  because, you know, if you look at the conditions where we live in, the size of these buildings,
[1:20:53.720 --> 1:21:00.440]  the communal corridors and lifts that we share, then you will be concerned about, you know,
[1:21:00.440 --> 1:21:05.320]  how easily coronavirus can spread in these communities. It's like this is my house,
[1:21:05.320 --> 1:21:12.600]  this is my living room. If you look down, basically, I'm high up. So, there you go. I can basically
[1:21:12.600 --> 1:21:17.800]  see all the towers. So, there's the Clementer Towers and this is the North Melbourne Towers.
[1:21:17.800 --> 1:21:21.480]  Yeah, a lot of members of our community are scared of a backlash. We're scared of racial
[1:21:21.480 --> 1:21:25.160]  profiling. We're scared of that backlash because right now, we actually look like, you know,
[1:21:25.160 --> 1:21:30.840]  we're the only people in Australia who are poor. We basically are not heeding to restrictions.
[1:21:30.840 --> 1:21:34.840]  We're spreading the virus. We don't care about anybody else. And that's far fresh
[1:21:34.840 --> 1:21:40.600]  from the truth. So, if you're going to roll out lockdowns, oh, it's the towers they built,
[1:21:40.600 --> 1:21:45.160]  just like Bloomberg and just like Bezos are building exact towers. Like, I live in a coffin
[1:21:45.160 --> 1:21:50.040]  apartment. It looked like it was 300 square feet, literally. Pull up the same room and everything.
[1:21:51.000 --> 1:21:54.840]  The corridor is so small, you can't walk through them. They're building three of those in Austin
[1:21:54.840 --> 1:22:00.680]  now that are even smaller. I talked about this yesterday. I said to herd you in. So, of course,
[1:22:00.680 --> 1:22:05.000]  now that they've done this to them, it's in the article that starting next week, it's the whole
[1:22:05.000 --> 1:22:09.720]  city. Oh, don't worry. We won't be racist. But see, first it's, oh, it's the brown people we
[1:22:09.720 --> 1:22:14.360]  shipped in to control and put in the prison. And now once we got it, they did test it on them.
[1:22:14.360 --> 1:22:19.480]  Now we're going to do it to everybody. Everyone will be locked down sector by sector and forcibly
[1:22:19.480 --> 1:22:26.040]  tested until they submit. And it's all you in run and it's all coming to you because there's
[1:22:26.040 --> 1:22:31.320]  nothing you won't put up with. Oh, just put the mask on and the next. Oh, just take the tracker
[1:22:31.320 --> 1:22:36.520]  app. Oh, just let the global Clinton initiative into your house to check. Oh, just, just take
[1:22:36.520 --> 1:22:42.120]  the inoculation. Oh, just let us have your kid to drag Queen story time with a pedophile. Oh,
[1:22:42.120 --> 1:22:46.440]  just let us teach you about Nambla. Oh, let us tell your five-year-old son. He's really a girl.
[1:22:46.440 --> 1:22:51.560]  And now he has the right at age nine to chop his testicles off. It's all here. A cult takeover
[1:22:51.560 --> 1:22:57.960]  on record. They created all to end this. It's a scientific extermination system. And I've looked
[1:22:57.960 --> 1:23:02.920]  at it up one side and down the other. And I don't go around looking for flying saucers at night,
[1:23:02.920 --> 1:23:08.360]  folks, or I don't try to conjure goblins or demons. I've studied the globalist and they behave like
[1:23:08.360 --> 1:23:13.960]  an alien species involved in a systematic dehumanization, takeover, deindustrialization,
[1:23:13.960 --> 1:23:19.080]  training us to go into cages, independence, and to set up a medical tyranny that they admit is
[1:23:19.080 --> 1:23:24.120]  here to get rid of us. Now, the globalists themselves say they're following a off-world
[1:23:24.120 --> 1:23:27.800]  entity that's given them advanced knowledge and they have to carry this out so that only they,
[1:23:27.800 --> 1:23:32.440]  the elites, give up their bodies, merge with machines. And they wrote books about it, you know,
[1:23:32.440 --> 1:23:36.840]  to condition the public childhoods in and things back in the fifties. This is their plan. Now,
[1:23:36.840 --> 1:23:39.960]  whether they're really getting off-world interdimensional transmissions or not, I don't

[1:25:47.240 --> 1:25:53.880]  One of our best selling products is Living Defense, and it's been sold out for over four months
[1:25:53.880 --> 1:25:58.040]  because it's hard to source the ingredients that are organic. We've got a limited supply right now,
[1:25:58.040 --> 1:26:01.880]  but it's selling out fast, and I want those of you that haven't experienced Living Defense
[1:26:01.880 --> 1:26:06.280]  to get it for yourself. Here's just part of one testimonial. I looked in January 2016,
[1:26:06.280 --> 1:26:10.360]  I went in the hospital, I went to VA hospital out here in Boyce, and I was in there until
[1:26:10.360 --> 1:26:15.320]  June, and one of the only things that got me through that ordeal was listening to Infowars
[1:26:15.320 --> 1:26:19.960]  three hours a day, and I kept hearing Dr. Group and all you guys talking about Living Defense.
[1:26:19.960 --> 1:26:24.600]  Let me tell you something, man. I had an internal digestive problem, and I stumbled with it for
[1:26:24.600 --> 1:26:29.160]  about five or six years, and the doctors, they tried every time. Nobody could figure out what it
[1:26:29.160 --> 1:26:32.920]  is, and then every day when I kept hearing you and Dr. Group and those commercials, I said,
[1:26:32.920 --> 1:26:36.200]  you know what, I'm going to get me some of that freaking Living Defense. Now, I wasn't supposed
[1:26:36.200 --> 1:26:39.320]  to have any nutritionals because they don't want you to have that stuff, but I ordered it,
[1:26:39.320 --> 1:26:44.280]  had it shipped to me, I got it, I hid it from the nurses, I started taking it, man. That stuff
[1:26:44.280 --> 1:26:49.000]  changed my life, it saved my life. Alex Jones and Infowars saved my life.
[1:27:15.000 --> 1:27:20.520]  Trust me, honey. Every man's gonna be all right.
[1:27:22.520 --> 1:27:30.520]  Just do like I do. There ain't nothing to it. Listen to me, baby, and if you can't do it,
[1:27:30.520 --> 1:27:34.520]  all you gotta do is just let yourself go.
[1:27:34.520 --> 1:27:43.560]  Oh, baby, don't be afraid, just relax and take it real slow. Cool it, baby.
[1:27:45.560 --> 1:27:48.840]  Cool it, baby. You ain't got no place to go.
[1:27:52.520 --> 1:27:56.520]  Just push your arms around me. Real tight. Real tight.
[1:27:56.520 --> 1:28:05.240]  You go yourself, baby. Don't fight. All you gotta do is let yourself go.
[1:28:05.240 --> 1:28:08.680]  All right. I'm not normally just gonna sing a song or wait on Roger Stone,
[1:28:08.680 --> 1:28:13.720]  having perpetual Skype issues, but he's got big breaking news with us here. He told me a lot,
[1:28:13.720 --> 1:28:19.480]  but we'll see how much he can say about what's going on. He's just six days out from his imprisonment
[1:28:20.360 --> 1:28:25.880]  for thought crime. Before we go any further, Fourth of July Super Sale continues, but it
[1:28:25.880 --> 1:28:30.600]  is officially going to end Sunday night, Monday morning, because a lot of these items that have
[1:28:30.600 --> 1:28:35.640]  been sold out have come back in, but we can only get limited amounts of them because of supply chain
[1:28:35.640 --> 1:28:40.600]  issues. And so I'm going to end the sale before a lot of these sell out so we can fund ourselves.
[1:28:41.720 --> 1:28:46.600]  And so we have store-wide free shipping, double-patriot points, but on these particular items,
[1:28:46.600 --> 1:28:51.480]  lung cleanse, 50% off after being sold out for months, vitamin mineral fusion, 50% off for
[1:28:51.480 --> 1:28:56.360]  being sold out for months. That's so good for adults and children. Vaso beats, so good for
[1:28:56.360 --> 1:29:04.360]  cardiovascular, creates key compounds that are known to be in the beat extract that are so good
[1:29:04.360 --> 1:29:09.880]  for you out of stock for months. Finally, back in stock, DNA Force Plus, the PQQ and the CoQ10
[1:29:09.880 --> 1:29:14.840]  sold out for months. And finally, back in stock, Winter Sun, 50% off, sold out for months. And
[1:29:14.840 --> 1:29:20.040]  finally, back in stock, Ultra 12 sold out for months. Now back in stock, Body's Ultimate
[1:29:20.040 --> 1:29:28.760]  Fumic formula sold out for months. Now back in stock. And here's something else with all the
[1:29:28.760 --> 1:29:33.320]  stuff that's going on. Use the lull in the store. As I told you, more lockdowns are coming. It's
[1:29:33.320 --> 1:29:41.240]  going to intensify the depression supply chain problems. They don't want to create a depression.
[1:29:41.240 --> 1:29:46.200]  It's too bad. That's why they squeeze, let off, squeeze, let off, but it's incredibly dangerous.
[1:29:46.200 --> 1:29:50.840]  You need to get high quality, storeable food. We have the best company. They have the highest quality.
[1:29:50.840 --> 1:29:54.920]  It's all packaged very, very well the last 25 years. It's something you're going to need in the
[1:29:54.920 --> 1:30:00.520]  next few years, I believe, but it's no problem because it's insurance you can eat. And with
[1:30:00.520 --> 1:30:04.280]  inflation on the horizon, I think we'll probably have quite a bit in the next five, 10 years.
[1:30:04.280 --> 1:30:08.760]  This is a great way to put something into the bank that'll taste great in a couple of years
[1:30:08.760 --> 1:30:12.840]  and save you money. So I would get your orders in now while it's three to four weeks for delivery.
[1:30:12.840 --> 1:30:16.520]  They got up that big hump, got it all delivered while you still can because I predict
[1:30:17.240 --> 1:30:21.160]  you're going to see even bigger runs on storeable food and things than we saw earlier this year.
[1:30:21.160 --> 1:30:24.280]  That's what I really think is going to happen. I think things are just going to get crazier
[1:30:24.280 --> 1:30:41.160]  from this time on out. Now, we are joined, ladies and gentlemen, by Roger Stone
[1:30:41.160 --> 1:30:47.320]  Stone with breaking information just five and a half, six days from having to report to federal
[1:30:47.880 --> 1:30:56.040]  prison. And he's also got an analysis on an unprecedented censorship. Bolsonaro is under
[1:30:56.040 --> 1:31:01.880]  the same attack saying that his fans aren't allowed to talk about him or post his speeches
[1:31:01.880 --> 1:31:07.480]  or material. Well, now Facebook has done that to Roger Stone on Facebook and Instagram,
[1:31:07.480 --> 1:31:15.560]  quote, cracks down on inauthentic activity. So ahead of his pardon or ahead of his clemency
[1:31:15.560 --> 1:31:20.040]  or ahead of him having to go to prison, if the president doesn't act, they are silencing everyone
[1:31:20.040 --> 1:31:26.200]  that might cry out against this and another giant authoritarian exercise of evil. And as I said,
[1:31:26.200 --> 1:31:31.320]  they're also doing it to Bolsonaro. Here's Reuters, the exact same thing, cracking down on
[1:31:31.320 --> 1:31:37.320]  one inauthentic information and, quote, a disinformation network. And they say Bolsonaro
[1:31:37.320 --> 1:31:43.400]  sending any Facebook messages from his campaign to fans is disinformation because the ADL
[1:31:43.400 --> 1:31:50.360]  and the UN decide what is official, not just here, but worldwide. So this is a total hijacking of
[1:31:50.360 --> 1:31:56.200]  the telecommunication system worldwide and his next generation warfare that the Pentagon and
[1:31:56.200 --> 1:32:02.200]  the president must grow up to or be totally captured by it. But we are in World War Four right now.
[1:32:02.200 --> 1:32:07.400]  It's an information war. Roger Stone, thank you for joining us. Alex, I'm great to be back with
[1:32:07.400 --> 1:32:12.440]  you. I apologize that we could get our Skype up. No problem. Let's just get right into it, my friend.
[1:32:13.000 --> 1:32:17.400]  Well, right now I'm wearing an Alex Jones did nothing wrong t-shirt that I was hoping you
[1:32:17.400 --> 1:32:22.280]  could see. But in any event, I'm glad to be with you. What do you want to get into first?
[1:32:22.280 --> 1:32:29.320]  Well, we just had developments only minutes ago in the U.S. District Court of Appeals. I'd like
[1:32:29.320 --> 1:32:36.760]  to jump into that real quick. Just as a quick review, as you know, when we learned that the
[1:32:36.760 --> 1:32:44.360]  current Department of Justice and U.S. Bureau of Prison's policy of releasing those inmates
[1:32:44.360 --> 1:32:51.880]  convicted of nonviolent crimes from prison to home confinement because of the dangers of
[1:32:51.880 --> 1:32:59.320]  COVID-19 apply for a creepy porn lawyer, Michael Alvinotti, who stole 25 million,
[1:33:02.040 --> 1:33:09.320]  Michael Cohen, the ex-Trump lawyer convicted of financial crimes who became a witness against
[1:33:09.320 --> 1:33:17.720]  the president, and Rick Gates, Paul Manafort's former bag man who got a 45-day sentence for
[1:33:17.720 --> 1:33:25.320]  multi-million-dollar tax crimes in return for false testimony against me. They are all in
[1:33:25.320 --> 1:33:32.680]  home confinement, but Roger Stone at 57 and with a long history of pulmonary problems, mostly asthma,
[1:33:33.400 --> 1:33:41.720]  must report to prison next Tuesday. So Judge Jackson ruled, despite all precedents in her
[1:33:41.720 --> 1:33:49.720]  circuit and others for compassionate release, despite the reports of outstanding tests of COVID
[1:33:49.720 --> 1:33:56.680]  at the prison where they want to send me, despite the policy of the DOJ and FOP,
[1:33:56.680 --> 1:34:03.960]  and despite extensive medical records and tests and studies supplied to her by my position,
[1:34:03.960 --> 1:34:09.960]  she ordered me to prison. We immediately appealed that order. The government did not,
[1:34:09.960 --> 1:34:14.200]  under Bill Barr, oppose the order. They didn't support it, but they did not oppose it,
[1:34:14.200 --> 1:34:21.320]  which is significant. Minutes ago, we filed an immediate appeal. The issues have not changed
[1:34:21.320 --> 1:34:26.920]  in the slightest, other than the fact that now there are confirmed cases at the prison they
[1:34:26.920 --> 1:34:33.080]  want to send to me in Georgia. But in a stunner, the government has now completely slipped,
[1:34:33.080 --> 1:34:41.960]  and now they support sending me to prison in just, I guess, five days now. Given the fact
[1:34:41.960 --> 1:34:47.800]  that none of the facts in the case have changed, other than to my benefit, because there were a
[1:34:47.800 --> 1:34:54.520]  number of outstanding COVID tests that the Bureau of Prisons still didn't have results on, I can't
[1:34:54.520 --> 1:34:59.720]  understand the government's position. I cannot understand how they justify-
[1:34:59.720 --> 1:35:03.800]  Now Harvey Weinstein only spent a few months after being convicted of brutal rape,
[1:35:04.680 --> 1:35:08.680]  how you guilty of thought crime are about to be sentenced to possible death if you believe
[1:35:08.680 --> 1:35:12.200]  they're a whole COVID situation. And it's true, eating prison food, you don't get D3,
[1:35:12.200 --> 1:35:17.480]  you don't get zinc. Also, I mean, who knows what they'll pull on you in prison. I'd be worried
[1:35:17.480 --> 1:35:22.760]  about them, you know, winding up somebody to beat you to death, like they like to do to people
[1:35:22.760 --> 1:35:28.280]  they want to get rid of, and it will be on the judge's head if you get hurt in that prison,
[1:35:28.280 --> 1:35:31.480]  because no doubt it'll be the Clintons who are doing it. I know you don't want to scare your
[1:35:31.480 --> 1:35:35.640]  wife, but now's the time, Roger, to really talk about the reality. I wouldn't be worried about
[1:35:35.640 --> 1:35:40.360]  COVID if I was you. I'd be worried about them, you know, trying to Jeffrey Epstein you because
[1:35:40.360 --> 1:35:43.720]  you're a big embarrassment to them, and they don't want you to be able to be pardoned by the
[1:35:43.720 --> 1:35:49.320]  president. He must pardon or give you clemency now. Well, I think that it's really very obvious.
[1:35:49.320 --> 1:35:55.960]  The reason they want to send me to prison now is because they cannot afford for my appeal of my
[1:35:55.960 --> 1:36:02.120]  conviction to come to hearing, which would be about a year or now, because then when we finally
[1:36:02.120 --> 1:36:07.400]  get to a courtroom that isn't controlled by Judge Jackson, all of the facts will be exposed. The
[1:36:07.400 --> 1:36:13.160]  epic corruption of my trial, the epic corruption of the jury for women, and at least one and perhaps
[1:36:13.160 --> 1:36:19.560]  two other jurors, the epic corruption of the prosecutors who defrauded the court on multiple
[1:36:19.560 --> 1:36:27.560]  occasions, and I think engaged in other misconduct. You know, my case remains under seal, so I can't
[1:36:27.560 --> 1:36:33.160]  discuss those things today, but in the proper forum, they will all be exposed, and I really
[1:36:33.160 --> 1:36:36.440]  believe that I will be exonerated. Oh, you will be. I know what you're talking about. You don't
[1:36:36.440 --> 1:36:40.520]  want to get into it because stay there, Roger. Let's come back and talk about the massive censorship.
[1:36:40.520 --> 1:36:45.560]  This is all bigger than Roger Stone. We are all Roger Stone right now, infowars.com.
[1:36:45.560 --> 1:36:55.000]  I am cutting the sad on Friday, and by Monday afternoon, we have to end this special because
[1:36:55.000 --> 1:36:59.640]  even though a lot of these items have been sold out and just came back in, we only ordered a limited
[1:36:59.640 --> 1:37:04.280]  amount of things like bodies, our ultimate turmeric formula, because quite frankly,
[1:37:04.280 --> 1:37:09.880]  the supply chain has broken down on COVID-19 and a lot of products we've been unable to even get
[1:37:09.880 --> 1:37:14.600]  back in stock because the companies we get them from are partially shut down. This is totally
[1:37:14.600 --> 1:37:20.040]  crazy. So you've got just a few days left to take advantage of the July 4th mega sale with

[1:38:49.080 --> 1:38:56.840]  Ultra 12 is already our overall number one best seller. Ultra 12 is twice as strong as Secret 12
[1:38:56.840 --> 1:39:02.840]  for an even lower price because I signed a huge multi-year contract to guarantee to buy a ton
[1:39:02.840 --> 1:39:09.320]  of it. And my bet ended up to be successful so far. Folks are ordering it in mass. They're getting
[1:39:09.320 --> 1:39:15.000]  great responses. They're giving us incredible reviews because we know what vitamin B12 of this
[1:39:15.000 --> 1:39:19.240]  type does taken under the tongue where it's more absorbable. It supports healthy nerve and brain
[1:39:19.240 --> 1:39:25.400]  cells, helps make DNA, help the body produce more energy, help produce healthy blood cells,

[1:41:10.120 --> 1:41:22.680]  Welcome back, ladies and gentlemen. I am your host, Alex Jones, and we've got Roger Stone
[1:41:23.320 --> 1:41:28.040]  on the phone with us here five days out from being sent to prison for a thought criminal,
[1:41:28.600 --> 1:41:32.040]  and Congressman Matt Gaetz came out yesterday when the media was gloating and saying,
[1:41:32.040 --> 1:41:35.400]  ah, you're going to prison, you're not going to get a pardon and said, think again, Roger Stone's
[1:41:35.400 --> 1:41:39.480]  not going to prison. And Sean Hannity and a lot of other folks that have talked to the president
[1:41:40.600 --> 1:41:44.360]  have said the same thing is about to happen, but Roger's not talked to the president while
[1:41:44.360 --> 1:41:47.960]  he doesn't know, so talk about being on the edge of his seat. Roger Stone should not
[1:41:49.080 --> 1:41:55.080]  disproportionately bear the burden of corrupt Mueller investigation. Gaetz also came out yesterday,
[1:41:55.080 --> 1:42:00.280]  it was all over the news, and said that Roger Stone is not going to be going to prison, so
[1:42:00.280 --> 1:42:06.280]  the left out there shouldn't hold their breath. I want to talk about that briefly with Roger.
[1:42:06.280 --> 1:42:11.560]  Roger, five days out, what do you think is going to happen? Well, my faith is in God.
[1:42:11.560 --> 1:42:16.200]  I mean, in all honesty, I've been very forthright about the fact that I've been able to hold up
[1:42:16.200 --> 1:42:21.560]  and fight this through. I've had the serenity and the strength to keep fighting only because I was
[1:42:21.560 --> 1:42:28.040]  reborn. I reaffirmed my belief in Jesus Christ back in January on the advice of Reverend Franklin
[1:42:28.040 --> 1:42:35.160]  Graham, and I never look back. I'm telling you, Al, I reaffirmed my faith in Christ on a Saturday.
[1:42:35.160 --> 1:42:40.120]  I confessed my sins. I decided to get right with Jesus and try to walk in his way.
[1:42:40.120 --> 1:42:45.880]  And one day morning, the story hit the fan about the jury corruption completely exposed
[1:42:45.880 --> 1:42:52.360]  in my case. It was like overnight. So God works in mysterious ways. This is in his hands,
[1:42:52.360 --> 1:42:56.680]  which is why I'm confident. I really believe that everything will be fine,
[1:42:56.680 --> 1:43:03.000]  because the Bible tells us God will never desert you. He will always protect you.
[1:43:03.000 --> 1:43:08.200]  So I feel pretty good. Now, do I have inside information? No, I don't. I'm encouraged when
[1:43:08.200 --> 1:43:13.160]  I read this from Matt Gaetz because he is a close friend and protege of the president,
[1:43:13.160 --> 1:43:18.520]  but he's not returning my call, so I couldn't tell you what it means. But it sounds pretty good,
[1:43:18.520 --> 1:43:23.800]  and it calms my wife down some. So we're just hoping for the best. I'm going to keep fighting,
[1:43:23.800 --> 1:43:28.120]  you know, no matter what. But the reason they have to silence me is so obvious.
[1:43:28.120 --> 1:43:33.400]  If I were allowed to remain out of prison pending appeal and I get to appeal, they will all be
[1:43:33.400 --> 1:43:41.400]  exposed and they know it. Well, Roger, I mean, the way they want you as the shrunken head,
[1:43:41.400 --> 1:43:45.240]  as this token of their victory, even the New York Times says about me, if you can just bankrupt
[1:43:45.240 --> 1:43:49.320]  Jones and shut him down or put him in prison, it'll be a consolation prize. But then we've
[1:43:49.320 --> 1:43:54.200]  got to get all of Trump's other supporters, even if Trump's removed, we've got to level them. We've
[1:43:54.200 --> 1:43:59.080]  got to burn them down. We've got to destroy. They're talking about America. They literally
[1:43:59.080 --> 1:44:06.120]  want to drive us into submission and dominate us. Well, I understand that. But we are, although
[1:44:06.120 --> 1:44:11.000]  we are not committed to illegal tactics, I'm just as committed to fighting them as they are to
[1:44:11.000 --> 1:44:17.800]  fighting me. It is outrageous that they're going around the country tearing down statues of George
[1:44:17.800 --> 1:44:23.560]  Washington and Thomas Jefferson and Abraham Lincoln. But when black people are pulling down
[1:44:23.560 --> 1:44:29.880]  a statue of friends of Douglas, this shows how ignorant they are. This shows how this has no
[1:44:29.880 --> 1:44:35.480]  point. It is violence for the sake of anarchy, violence for the sake of destruction. They have
[1:44:35.480 --> 1:44:41.320]  no plan for America. And I know many patriots in this country are not going to let that happen.
[1:44:42.120 --> 1:44:47.560]  They're not going to let them cancel our democracy. This next election is going to be the most
[1:44:47.560 --> 1:44:53.400]  crucial election in our lifetime. And they're going to cheat. And we're going to have to
[1:44:53.400 --> 1:44:58.440]  fight it out in the ports in the end, in my view. Thank God the president has appointed
[1:44:58.440 --> 1:45:03.400]  so many conservative jurists, fair-minded, honest, conservative jurists.
[1:45:04.520 --> 1:45:09.720]  Well, I don't know. That's the case, though, reflecting Gorsuch and Kavanaugh ruling against
[1:45:09.720 --> 1:45:13.960]  him on his tax returns today, seven to two. I know he's appointed over, what is it,
[1:45:13.960 --> 1:45:19.560]  300 judiciary now? Well, it's thousands total, but at the highest level. What do you make of that?
[1:45:20.440 --> 1:45:24.840]  Well, are they going to be disappointed when they find nothing whatsoever wrong in the president's
[1:45:24.840 --> 1:45:29.480]  tax returns? Nothing. They're going to find nothing. I mean, they're going to find that he
[1:45:29.480 --> 1:45:34.280]  paid a huge amount of taxes. They're probably going to find out that he used deductions that
[1:45:34.280 --> 1:45:39.880]  are perfectly allowable under the law to save paying taxes. But if he didn't do that, he'd be too
[1:45:39.880 --> 1:45:44.920]  stupid to be president. Well, they already got some earlier ones and went, oh, look, you know,
[1:45:44.920 --> 1:45:49.560]  he would put money in family trust. That's what every rich person does. But let's just, I mean,
[1:45:49.560 --> 1:45:53.480]  that's just standard, you know, go to accounting and do that, you know, go to a CPA or a tax lawyer,
[1:45:53.480 --> 1:45:56.600]  you've got any extra money, not even rich people, middle class folks do that.
[1:45:58.440 --> 1:46:03.640]  Speaking of making things up, they're all over the news saying you use disinformation groups
[1:46:03.640 --> 1:46:07.400]  and that you're all over Facebook and Instagram. So anyone promoting you is going to be banned.
[1:46:07.400 --> 1:46:10.440]  And it's the same group that put out Russiagate hoaxes. Tell us about that.
[1:46:11.080 --> 1:46:16.760]  Yeah, it turns out that some outfit out of New York that is financed by two Wall Street firms,
[1:46:16.760 --> 1:46:21.640]  we're digging into that as I, I just have a suspicion we're going to find Soros money sooner
[1:46:21.640 --> 1:46:28.280]  or later, put together this extraordinarily fabricated dossier, let's call it, in which they
[1:46:28.280 --> 1:46:34.920]  claim that I owned hundreds of fake Facebook accounts in the names of other people. Let's
[1:46:34.920 --> 1:46:41.400]  be clear, I've never owned one fake Facebook account in the name of another person. They,
[1:46:42.040 --> 1:46:50.920]  they suggested I set up and control the vast network of fake sites to promulgate false
[1:46:50.920 --> 1:46:57.400]  information. Now, it's clever because it winds in and out with perfectly legitimate, legal,
[1:46:57.960 --> 1:47:04.040]  fully authorized political activity. I mean, there's no question on my own Facebook pages,
[1:47:04.040 --> 1:47:08.760]  on my, which are clearly identified as mine, on my own Instagram accounts,
[1:47:08.760 --> 1:47:14.120]  I have called out reporters who promulgate the fake Russia. Sure, they're saying you
[1:47:14.120 --> 1:47:18.360]  communicating with people and then people on vacation with their dogs in Colorado,
[1:47:18.360 --> 1:47:22.760]  putting a link to it. They're claiming that's a sock puppet of you and you never met them.
[1:47:22.760 --> 1:47:27.480]  I mean, I went and looked at this, it's unbelievable how they defame that, but Bolsonaro
[1:47:28.440 --> 1:47:32.680]  Reuters reports they just did the same thing to him. They're saying if his office or campaign
[1:47:32.680 --> 1:47:38.040]  ever even sends messages out to Facebook fans telling them thank you or responding back,
[1:47:38.040 --> 1:47:43.640]  that that's disinformation. Well, you know, you're absolutely right. So in other words,
[1:47:43.640 --> 1:47:48.840]  if a person out there who has their own Facebook account, where they post about their kids and
[1:47:48.840 --> 1:47:54.360]  their grandkids in their car and music and concerts and food and so on, but they happen to put up a
[1:47:54.360 --> 1:48:00.360]  post that is favorable to Roger Stone, they got shut down yesterday despite the fact that I might
[1:48:00.360 --> 1:48:09.080]  not even know who they are. The claim that I used fake Facebook posts to post some of the
[1:48:09.080 --> 1:48:16.360]  WikiLeaks disclosures, demonstrably, provably false. So these guys in New York, Graphica,
[1:48:16.360 --> 1:48:21.080]  and this woman who did the same kind of con job for the Senate Intelligence Committee,
[1:48:21.080 --> 1:48:26.040]  they will have ample opportunity to show their proof. Because Alex, money has poured into my
[1:48:26.040 --> 1:48:32.040]  legal defense fund in the last 24 hours when I put out an appeal based on stopping the censors.
[1:48:32.040 --> 1:48:38.760]  I'm going to stew the crap out of all these people because this report is a pack of lies.
[1:48:38.760 --> 1:48:44.280]  Here's the other point. If you're a journalist, say with the Wall Street Journal, perfect example,
[1:48:44.280 --> 1:48:52.040]  and you report this as a fact without saying allegedly or may have, I'm coming after you too.
[1:48:52.040 --> 1:48:58.920]  Roger, you are absolutely right. Again, that's why when I say we're all Roger Stone,
[1:48:59.480 --> 1:49:04.360]  they're coming after everybody. I could play CNN clips, MSNBC clips, New York Times articles,
[1:49:04.360 --> 1:49:10.440]  what they say. After we get Trump and Roger Stone and Alex Jones and all of Trump's friends,
[1:49:10.440 --> 1:49:15.160]  we're going to punish all these people at every level. We're going to go after millions of people.
[1:49:15.160 --> 1:49:22.600]  I mean, these are terrorists. These are authoritarians. These are the real McCoy. These are the enemy.
[1:49:24.760 --> 1:49:30.520]  Roger, you still there? Well, that ended on a good note with Roger, so it's okay.
[1:49:31.960 --> 1:49:35.560]  His internet was cut off today. Probably an accident. He's paid his bill.
[1:49:36.520 --> 1:49:41.480]  His computers keep getting, well, he got SWAT team. He got SWAT team by 23 FBI agents that
[1:49:41.480 --> 1:49:49.000]  grabbed everything, and then they left an actual wrong hard drive with a camera footage on it.
[1:49:49.000 --> 1:49:55.240]  Roger, are you there? I've learned when to tap out, guys. I've just, I don't want to tap out.
[1:49:55.240 --> 1:49:59.800]  All right. I have my instincts. I'm ready to tap out. Roger's not there. I'm not going to,
[1:49:59.800 --> 1:50:04.760]  you know, the most amateur thing on talk radio, Howard Stern does this where he calls,
[1:50:04.760 --> 1:50:09.160]  he has prank callers, call a radio station, and then act like they're a guest or a caller,
[1:50:09.160 --> 1:50:13.240]  and then go, hello, hello, and then say a little something and then not be there. And then say a
[1:50:13.240 --> 1:50:19.160]  little, I have a pet peeve, and it's that. It's Roger's cell phones out. And so I'm not going
[1:50:19.160 --> 1:50:25.880]  to do this thing where I go back and forth and back and forth and back and forth and back. I'm
[1:50:25.880 --> 1:50:33.960]  not doing it. Anyways, the ongoing technical difficulties are fun. They are fun. And I refuse
[1:50:33.960 --> 1:50:39.480]  to wallow in them. Like, I'm going to go off air. I'm leaving. I refuse to be part of this crap.
[1:50:41.320 --> 1:50:48.120]  I'm telling you, man, because it's not that. It's doing it over and over and over and over
[1:50:48.120 --> 1:50:53.880]  and over and over again. The failure, the criminals everywhere and the devil doctors
[1:50:53.880 --> 1:50:59.080]  killing all the old people and the liars like Bill Gates and we all just sit here while they crap
[1:50:59.080 --> 1:51:10.760]  all over us. Okay, there is the UN. Well, Saucer Bear Cohen says I might want to talk about this
[1:51:10.760 --> 1:51:14.280]  while I have me arrested, but I'm going to talk about it. In fact, get Cohen, cuter. We're able
[1:51:14.280 --> 1:51:21.880]  to do that. Great crew. I'm not mad at them. I'm just, it's little amateur pet peeve things I have
[1:51:21.880 --> 1:51:29.400]  that we're done with that body. We're done. We're done. We're done, done, done, done, done, done,
[1:51:29.400 --> 1:51:34.600]  done, done, done, done, done. Ever again, ever again, ever again. All right.
[1:51:39.400 --> 1:51:43.240]  Let's go to Juan in Connecticut. You're on the air. Thanks for holding. Hello. Can you hear me?
[1:51:43.240 --> 1:51:47.800]  I sure can, sir. Thank you. Hey, Alex. Before I start, man, I just wanted to talk to you,
[1:51:47.800 --> 1:51:52.360]  bro, and it's a pleasure to be talking right now here, man. Sir, it's an honor to talk to you,
[1:51:52.360 --> 1:51:58.040]  brother. I'm from New Brink, Connecticut, and I just want to plug in. I'm a truck driver and two
[1:51:58.040 --> 1:52:04.360]  before us have changed the way I drive. Me and my brothers that drive, there's a couple of us.
[1:52:04.360 --> 1:52:11.800]  We're all Hispanics, Cubans, Puerto Ricans. We used to be on Monster and Red Bull and Rolla,
[1:52:11.800 --> 1:52:16.040]  and I have lost weight because I stopped drinking all that sugar, and I just want to thank you for
[1:52:16.040 --> 1:52:21.240]  that, man. Well, brother, we put more in this than any other long-term high-quality energy powder
[1:52:21.240 --> 1:52:25.480]  there is. So this was designed on one of the top guys in the country. He didn't want his name on it
[1:52:25.480 --> 1:52:28.680]  because obviously the political issues, but we had to pay a lot of money for this formulation
[1:52:28.680 --> 1:52:33.160]  just for the design of it. And we believe it is the best, strongest, but healthiest energy
[1:52:33.160 --> 1:52:36.520]  out there, and you're saying that it's made your life better. So that means a lot to me. Thank you
[1:52:36.520 --> 1:52:42.760]  to all your truck drivers. We love you. The fourth of July 2020 special has gone into high gear.
[1:52:42.760 --> 1:52:49.800]  We have 50% off bodies, really strong extractive turmeric formula. It's been sold out for months.

[1:53:34.840 --> 1:53:40.600]  your continued prayer, your focus, and your support. Again, I salute you all.
[1:53:42.760 --> 1:53:45.400]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[1:53:57.880 --> 1:54:02.440]  This is our country and it's very best. What an incredible achievement.
[1:54:02.440 --> 1:54:08.600]  Of course, the coverage and admiration for Mount Rushmore was business as usual for Bernie Sanders
[1:54:08.600 --> 1:54:15.160]  and later Barack Obama. CNN's Jim Acosta even referred to Barack Obama's stop at Mount Rushmore
[1:54:15.160 --> 1:54:22.600]  as a fitting stop for a presidential contender in 2008. Donald Trump chose the most grandiose
[1:54:22.600 --> 1:54:30.440]  symbol of U.S. imperialism on earth to usher in a very on-brand, star-spangled spectacle,
[1:54:30.440 --> 1:54:36.440]  complete with fireworks and military flyovers. It was Trump's predictable way of throwing red
[1:54:36.440 --> 1:54:42.040]  meat to his base. While the left triggered their petty tyrant New World Order response by claiming
[1:54:42.040 --> 1:54:48.440]  that television icon Mary Hart was flashing the white power symbol as she introduced Donald Trump.
[1:54:48.440 --> 1:54:56.440]  Thank you to you incredible audience. You have been here for hours today and it was only 125 degrees
[1:54:56.440 --> 1:55:02.280]  out here in the sun. That same group crying in their fourth of July cupcake has no comment
[1:55:02.280 --> 1:55:09.000]  when it comes to Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez spreading the same vicious KKK symbols.
[1:55:09.000 --> 1:55:13.240]  Meanwhile, President Trump gave America the best fireworks show the White House could
[1:55:13.240 --> 1:55:22.440]  muster under a tsunami of propaganda. 1776 represented the culmination of thousands of years
[1:55:22.440 --> 1:55:30.920]  of Western civilization and the triumph of not only spirit but of wisdom, philosophy, and reason.
[1:55:31.960 --> 1:55:39.000]  And yet, as we meet here tonight, there is a growing danger that threatens every blessing
[1:55:40.120 --> 1:55:49.400]  our ancestors fought so hard for, struggled, they bled to secure. Our nation is witnessing
[1:55:49.400 --> 1:55:57.880]  a merciless campaign to wipe out our history, to fame our heroes, erase our values, and indoctrinate
[1:55:57.880 --> 1:56:03.720]  our children. It sounded like a Stephen Miller speech, and that is something that appeals
[1:56:03.720 --> 1:56:08.680]  to the parts of the president's base that he really focuses on. This is wartime conservativism,
[1:56:08.680 --> 1:56:13.480]  this belief that conservatives are at war trying to protect the country from change.
[1:56:13.480 --> 1:56:17.400]  That message, I know it resonates well with the Hannity base, but I don't think this speech made
[1:56:17.400 --> 1:56:22.200]  any sense unless you had watched hundreds of hours of Fox News and you had read all of Newt
[1:56:22.200 --> 1:56:27.080]  Gingrich's books. You have to be fully plugged in to the narrative that the right wing is selling
[1:56:27.080 --> 1:56:32.760]  on radio, TV, and online, but it was in such contrast to what is the biggest cultural event,
[1:56:34.440 --> 1:56:39.160]  entertainment event this weekend. What's the biggest moment this weekend? It's the release
[1:56:39.160 --> 1:56:47.400]  of Hamilton on Disney Plus, the streaming service. Yes, this resonates with the core, but painting
[1:56:47.400 --> 1:56:53.880]  everybody who doesn't fully support the president's policies across the board as anarchists.
[1:56:53.880 --> 1:56:59.800]  Man is a coward. I say that clearly. I say it out loud. Donald Trump is a physical coward.
[1:56:59.800 --> 1:57:05.080]  Independence Day weekend. President Trump will be at Mount Rushmore, where he'll be standing in front
[1:57:05.080 --> 1:57:11.000]  of a monument of two slave owners and on land wrestled away from Native Americans told that
[1:57:11.640 --> 1:57:17.720]  be focusing on the effort to, quote, tear down our country's history. The nation's ideals and
[1:57:17.720 --> 1:57:24.840]  principles are being questioned. When you carve out, you know, four white men who were colonizers,
[1:57:24.840 --> 1:57:30.120]  who committed genocide against indigenous people, and for that to be okay in society today is
[1:57:30.120 --> 1:57:36.920]  fundamentally wrong. Tired of the American people turning against themselves in a house divided,
[1:57:36.920 --> 1:57:43.080]  making science partisan and not blaming the Chinese Communist Party for killing Americans,
[1:57:43.080 --> 1:57:47.240]  for putting us out of work and destroying trillions of dollars of our wealth. And I think
[1:57:47.240 --> 1:57:52.760]  that's a message that should be carried to the MSNBC audience, Ollie. And I just don't hear it.
[1:57:52.760 --> 1:57:57.080]  It's all about Trump this, Trump that he's the bad guy. He's the bad guy. He, you know,
[1:57:57.080 --> 1:58:01.560]  well, I can't tease the bad guy. As Trump derangement goons expressed their
[1:58:01.560 --> 1:58:06.760]  deep hatred for our country in the streets, celebrating the 4th of July by tossing the
[1:58:06.760 --> 1:58:12.520]  Columbus statue into Baltimore's inner harbor, total stupidity reigns among the disconnected
[1:58:12.520 --> 1:58:19.480]  Marxist cultural revolution brown shirt machine that is still supposedly protesting the death
[1:58:19.480 --> 1:58:25.720]  of George Floyd long after the police officers responsible have been arrested and after Minneapolis
[1:58:25.720 --> 1:58:30.120]  was declared a disaster area by the governor, John bound reporting,

[2:00:09.640 --> 2:00:14.120]  country and to see the corrupt communist chinese that oppress their own people by the hundreds of
[2:00:14.120 --> 2:00:21.160]  millions absolutely setting the standard worldwide and have the united nations be the only information
[2:00:21.160 --> 2:00:27.240]  allowed to be on us news and that medical doctors that disagree with it are shut down and now in
[2:00:27.240 --> 2:00:31.800]  australia whole apartment buildings are being locked down and the police are saying you can't

[2:04:41.800 --> 2:04:44.920]  where they say they're going to break down the third world and flood us with the third world
[2:04:44.920 --> 2:04:48.600]  because they will control them and they will brainwash them in the camps before they get
[2:04:48.600 --> 2:04:57.000]  them here in dan liman is an expert on this he lives in europe and he runs europe wars.com

[2:05:12.600 --> 2:05:17.960]  centers they're preparing they're brainwashing millions to break through like you saw in guatemala
[2:05:17.960 --> 2:05:22.120]  break through like you saw in greece break through like you saw in massedonia break through like
[2:05:22.120 --> 2:05:26.920]  they tried to do in romania and hungry with the client governments directing them and then 90
[2:05:26.920 --> 2:05:31.320]  percent years later never even have a job because they don't even let them get jobs they keep them
[2:05:32.520 --> 2:05:38.440]  in these giant compact city areas as a weapon that if the indigenous population does not submit
[2:05:38.440 --> 2:05:45.240]  to them they then unleash them in a tidal wave of attacks and macron says we're gonna replace the
[2:05:45.240 --> 2:05:52.360]  french with 230 something million africans and that the new and the new french will be african
[2:05:52.360 --> 2:05:59.800]  and they have at he v ad saying the new swede is somali the new frenchman is algerian and again
[2:05:59.800 --> 2:06:06.040]  and whites are bad it's total war the un is already in oppressed and used the third world and brought
[2:06:06.040 --> 2:06:10.040]  china into control abrica and now they turn it around as it collapses and they run the covet
[2:06:10.040 --> 2:06:16.200]  hoax and throw those people against us and they sit back just like in the old from russia we love
[2:06:16.200 --> 2:06:22.520]  james bond movie where there's three chinese fighting fish and the one goes in and kills the other
[2:06:22.520 --> 2:06:26.200]  but it's weak and then the other one comes in for the kill and that's all the globalists are doing
[2:06:26.200 --> 2:06:34.680]  is playing us all off against each other and it makes me extremely angry it makes me extremely
[2:06:34.680 --> 2:06:40.680]  frustrated it makes me come to the point and come to the level of just absolutely being
[2:06:40.680 --> 2:06:46.520]  at another point in my life just just just where where it's all 100 true it's all 100
[2:06:46.520 --> 2:06:51.240]  criminal it's all 100 lie you can prove all of it to be disinformation all of it to be
[2:06:51.240 --> 2:06:57.400]  authoritarian all of it to be predatory all of it to be absolutely wicked and diabolical and sick
[2:06:57.400 --> 2:07:01.800]  and degenerate and if you heard about a psycho doing one one billionth of this can be the greatest
[2:07:01.800 --> 2:07:06.200]  psycho on earth i mean this makes hitler look like a choir boy this makes mal look like an
[2:07:06.200 --> 2:07:10.520]  owl look like an amateur it's like Stalin look like a nincompoop compared to what they're doing it's

[2:12:43.080 --> 2:12:46.680]  have come out the fish will announce that in their platform now a replacement migration
[2:12:47.240 --> 2:12:51.960]  and to say that the un will run our open borders once trump's removed so it's all official now
[2:12:51.960 --> 2:12:55.880]  but sascha bericohm says you'll be arrested if you talk about this yeah and they've actually
[2:12:55.880 --> 2:13:00.840]  set that precedent of course in other countries such as sweden and in france if you speak poorly
[2:13:00.840 --> 2:13:05.320]  about about the migration situation there you could face prosecution you have people that get
[2:13:05.320 --> 2:13:09.960]  thrown in jail and find elderly swedes i've seen that have gotten fined and thrown in jail just
[2:13:09.960 --> 2:13:14.760]  for speaking poorly about the situation affecting them in sweden as it pertains to migration so i
[2:13:14.760 --> 2:13:18.920]  think that the precedent has already been set and we can look to other countries to see what could
[2:13:18.920 --> 2:13:23.720]  be rolled out here in the u.s. and it's all internationally run it's all un globalist plan
[2:13:24.280 --> 2:13:28.200]  in fact a bunch of democrat run cities are now announcing that they're not going to put the
[2:13:28.200 --> 2:13:33.000]  color of people up in mugshots that that's so europe's already done that for a while absolutely
[2:13:33.000 --> 2:13:38.840]  recently there were a couple days ago there was a bus driver who was he was driving bus in in bayonne
[2:13:38.840 --> 2:13:43.880]  france and he asked some of the riders to put their masks on and they refused and they ended
[2:13:43.880 --> 2:13:48.520]  up beating him into a he was brain dead now he's clinically brain dead and they haven't released
[2:13:48.520 --> 2:13:52.920]  any information about the attackers and a lot of people are wondering why haven't we seen any
[2:13:52.920 --> 2:13:57.560]  information and that's that's its scenario plays out very often in europe where you don't get very
[2:13:57.560 --> 2:14:02.600]  much information when the attack is committed by someone other than let's say a white male well just
[2:14:02.600 --> 2:14:07.720]  two days ago a big professor here in the u.s. refused to go along with fake statistics that
[2:14:07.720 --> 2:14:11.720]  whites attack blacks more often and he published you know the real fbi numbers and now he's in
[2:14:11.720 --> 2:14:17.320]  trouble exactly yeah and so that's the truth tellers are getting purged out of academia off of social
[2:14:17.320 --> 2:14:22.040]  media out of the media of course so there's only the narrative and if you don't speak the narrative
[2:14:22.040 --> 2:14:26.680]  then then you're going to get run out of town so it's not like we're becoming china we are
[2:14:26.680 --> 2:14:33.560]  like china i mean this is hard core super great 200 proof tyranny you've got dozens or not 30 or
[2:14:33.560 --> 2:14:39.160]  40 articles uh from europe wars dot com that tie all this together start getting into what's really
[2:14:39.160 --> 2:14:41.960]  happening the narrative the truth narrative they don't want to hear and then we'll get into the
[2:14:41.960 --> 2:14:46.280]  attempt and finally break our will completely and complete our journey into world government
[2:14:46.280 --> 2:14:50.120]  well sure we can talk about the issue at the moment of course that is with uh covid that is
[2:14:50.120 --> 2:14:55.320]  with the face masks that we're facing here in the u.s. that i've just now started to experience
[2:14:55.320 --> 2:15:00.120]  that things are a little bit looser in switzerland thank goodness but in other european countries
[2:15:00.120 --> 2:15:04.920]  such as spain they've gone really aggressive with the with the mask laws and the social distancing
[2:15:04.920 --> 2:15:09.720]  protocols and all that so in spain they really set the tone for what could be rolled out in the
[2:15:09.720 --> 2:15:14.360]  u.s. as well and recently they've started they just started opening the beaches there in spain
[2:15:14.360 --> 2:15:18.680]  just some people are allowed to go but they have drones patrolling the beaches they now have a
[2:15:18.680 --> 2:15:24.120]  civilian patrol force of over 3000 people where they hired people who had lost their jobs or
[2:15:24.120 --> 2:15:29.560]  unemployed people in spain they hired them on to start the civilian patrols and now they're
[2:15:29.560 --> 2:15:35.320]  walking around the beaches busting their own fellow spaniards for infractions on social distancing
[2:15:35.320 --> 2:15:40.680]  and all that so in the past week since they rolled out this new force just in the one autonomous
[2:15:40.680 --> 2:15:47.640]  region of uh let's see andalucia in spain they reported over 26 000 incidents these civilian
[2:15:47.640 --> 2:15:52.120]  patrols ratting them out to the police into the government where these people at the beach now
[2:15:52.120 --> 2:15:55.800]  maybe they weren't spread far enough apart or weren't wearing their mask and that's the contact
[2:15:55.800 --> 2:16:00.280]  tracers here remember the clinton foundation rolling out same in australia it's global absolutely
[2:16:00.280 --> 2:16:05.320]  and and it is rolling out globally so uh that's in spain and in spain uh we really look look at
[2:16:05.320 --> 2:16:09.080]  that as kind of like the test case for for what they're rolling out because they've been really
[2:16:09.080 --> 2:16:13.800]  strict there they have had uh one of the strictest lockdowns they recently said that the mask laws
[2:16:13.800 --> 2:16:19.640]  are going to stay in place until there is a cure or a vaccine for spain uh for for coronavirus so
[2:16:19.640 --> 2:16:22.680]  that's what the spaniards have then you'll have to have the medic law do you have the vaccine
[2:16:23.240 --> 2:16:28.440]  yep absolutely denmark just announced uh today that they are rolling out a covid-19 passport for
[2:16:28.440 --> 2:16:33.560]  travelers so uh if danish travelers want to go abroad they can bring this so-called passport
[2:16:33.560 --> 2:16:39.480]  with them to assure other authorities that they are coronavirus free so yeah i mean this is this
[2:16:39.480 --> 2:16:47.320]  is this is so this is so classic evil it is it is uh it's really crazy so uh i'm just back into the
[2:16:47.320 --> 2:16:52.680]  us for the first time since the coronavirus uh all hit and i'm just i'm shocked at the at the
[2:16:52.680 --> 2:16:57.880]  compliance from everyone here um i'm i find it a little disturbing the way that people are just
[2:16:57.880 --> 2:17:01.720]  rolling over to every little thing that's presented in front of them that they're supposed to do
[2:17:01.720 --> 2:17:06.440]  while at the same time people are allowed to go out and protest if it's for the uh sjw agenda
[2:17:06.440 --> 2:17:10.840]  i'll have a stack of articles when they're saying trump's responsible for the nationwide outbreak
[2:17:10.840 --> 2:17:16.040]  but 26 million marching for george soros uh black lives matter operation they're all good and have
[2:17:16.040 --> 2:17:19.800]  nothing to do with it right they're even publishing articles now saying that the black lives matter
[2:17:19.800 --> 2:17:24.840]  protest may have actually slowed the spread of coronavirus right you can't make this stuff up
[2:17:25.720 --> 2:17:31.400]  you i mean they're now saying that two plus two equals four is racist and it is please continue
[2:17:31.400 --> 2:17:35.640]  with uh what's going on dan sure sure we can get into what we've gotten into spain a bit there of
[2:17:35.640 --> 2:17:40.120]  course uh what i find so interesting is that they're able to roll out it's overnight overnight
[2:17:40.120 --> 2:17:44.680]  pretty much is a three thousand people they're able to hire to patrol the beaches of spain
[2:17:44.680 --> 2:17:50.920]  to check for people obeying these social distancing protocols however you have hundreds of migrants
[2:17:51.560 --> 2:17:56.120]  are landing on the beaches of spain that have been that has been happening now for a couple years now
[2:17:56.120 --> 2:18:01.560]  hundreds of or thousands depending on how you extrapolate right exactly so you have them landing
[2:18:01.560 --> 2:18:05.240]  on the beaches on the islands you have them actually landing on the canary islands off of
[2:18:05.240 --> 2:18:10.360]  africa but they can't seem to uh muster up any any forces to patrol the beaches for that kind of
[2:18:10.360 --> 2:18:15.400]  infraction and uh so it's amazing how they're able to to really crack down and clamp down when
[2:18:15.400 --> 2:18:19.560]  when something happens that that uh you know that they feel like they need to control but when they
[2:18:19.560 --> 2:18:22.760]  can't eat when they need to control the borders they all of a sudden can't do that and by the way
[2:18:22.760 --> 2:18:28.280]  george soros is on record with us money trump finally cut it off funding this through the u n this
[2:18:28.280 --> 2:18:33.880]  is u n paid for those zodiac boats just coming in coming in absolutely as we uncovered last year
[2:18:33.880 --> 2:18:39.400]  uh we were the first english speaking outlet if i'm not mistaken to uncover this story um we
[2:18:39.400 --> 2:18:44.200]  discovered uh based on monitoring the Croatian media that the Croatian police officers there
[2:18:44.200 --> 2:18:48.840]  were finding that migrants that were coming up through the Balkans were actually carrying um
[2:18:48.840 --> 2:18:53.880]  u n e u marked um mastercard debit cards that were preloaded with money that they were spending
[2:18:53.880 --> 2:18:58.360]  once they reached europe and uh we were actually the first outlet to report that and they denied it
[2:18:58.360 --> 2:19:03.560]  but then later admitted it exactly and actually thank goodness uh hungry really they they took
[2:19:03.560 --> 2:19:07.480]  notice of this story as it started to spread around and other outlets started carrying it
[2:19:07.480 --> 2:19:13.000]  and they actually pressured the e u into admitting that they had issued millions of these cards with
[2:19:13.000 --> 2:19:17.160]  tens or hundreds of millions of dollars worth of money loaded onto them for the migrant to spend
[2:19:17.160 --> 2:19:22.040]  as they made their journey into europe and the end game is totally way down europe collapse it
[2:19:22.040 --> 2:19:26.120]  bring in world government because only the u n can then control the borders we have to capitulate
[2:19:26.120 --> 2:19:30.760]  to u and world government or they'll keep flooding us absolutely and it's going to continue on things
[2:19:30.760 --> 2:19:36.520]  did slow down a tiny bit with a corona virus and the border shutdowns but uh they are picking up again
[2:19:36.520 --> 2:19:41.160]  as we've seen many reports that the illegal and legal migration to europe is uh on the
[2:19:41.160 --> 2:19:46.280]  upswing and we've got the articles in europe and the united states the illegal aliens the migrants
[2:19:46.280 --> 2:19:50.280]  they're exempt from all the rules so are the homeless shows i mean oh leave them alone it's
[2:19:50.280 --> 2:19:54.920]  just it's incredible it is actually uh one of the really interesting stories which we can get
[2:19:54.920 --> 2:19:59.080]  into a little bit later of course but to touch on in the uk they actually have this situation
[2:19:59.080 --> 2:20:03.480]  where we have migrants thousands and thousands of migrants are pouring across the english channel
[2:20:03.480 --> 2:20:09.320]  and naisal farage has gone from being a politician's statesman to being on the field in the field
[2:20:09.320 --> 2:20:14.440]  journalist and he's been reporting on this really and the police come after him absolutely absolutely
[2:20:14.440 --> 2:20:19.480]  and what he discovered was that few to none of the migrants are actually being tested for a corona
[2:20:19.480 --> 2:20:23.800]  virus on their way in so they're just being brought into the country and uh and then funneled right
[2:20:23.800 --> 2:20:27.480]  into the interior of the of the country because it's all just an excuse to have power grabs so
[2:20:27.480 --> 2:20:31.880]  the domestic security force forcibly inoculate us and make us take apps on our phones and track us
[2:20:31.880 --> 2:20:36.120]  it's all official and it's coming folks they're never going to stop the lockdowns till till you

[2:22:50.440 --> 2:22:56.200]  the psychological war chiefs that developed the coven 19 mind control hoax new that once they got
[2:22:56.200 --> 2:23:01.080]  the public for several months to wear masks in social distance they would be able to permanently
[2:23:01.080 --> 2:23:06.920]  turn it on and off at any time they want by putting handcuffs on someone and then add new demands
[2:23:06.920 --> 2:23:11.320]  that people take force inoculations that they have contact tracing on their phones and that
[2:23:11.320 --> 2:23:16.200]  every aspect of our lives be controlled this is all complete and total preparation for world
[2:23:16.200 --> 2:23:21.880]  government forced inoculation and complete enslavement of the human population this is
[2:23:21.880 --> 2:23:28.040]  medical tyranny this is the bill in the gates you can take over this is the end of civilization
[2:23:28.040 --> 2:23:33.880]  as you know it living in denial only empowers the enemy if you want to break free from this
[2:23:33.880 --> 2:23:38.760]  trance there's not much time warn everyone you know that it's a giant hoax show them the numbers
[2:23:38.760 --> 2:23:42.680]  show them the facts and explain that it's the end of the world as we know it if we don't wake up and
[2:23:42.680 --> 2:23:49.480]  resist you're listening to the alex jones show
[2:23:49.480 --> 2:24:00.280]  so
[2:24:05.320 --> 2:24:10.280]  waging war on corruption it's alex jones
[2:24:14.600 --> 2:24:18.200]  you can either roll over to this world government takeover that
[2:24:18.200 --> 2:24:21.400]  operates over the guise of medicine and humanitarianism where you can expose it
[2:24:23.080 --> 2:24:27.480]  the only way they've been able to get away with this far is control the dominant medium
[2:24:28.360 --> 2:24:34.840]  dumbing the public down and now censorship you look at the footage a few years ago of millions
[2:24:34.840 --> 2:24:39.160]  of people trying to slam into the Guatemalan border hundreds of thousands breaking across
[2:24:39.160 --> 2:24:48.120]  the caravans advancing that was a un test of how excuse me of how we respond in yeah absolutely
[2:24:48.120 --> 2:24:52.200]  you know we've seen a lot of the same warnings coming out from these international agencies
[2:24:52.200 --> 2:24:57.560]  basically in europe and the united states saying that the coronavirus the fallout from the coronavirus
[2:24:57.560 --> 2:25:02.840]  the economic fallout and also if there are breakouts in the camps that basically that would
[2:25:02.840 --> 2:25:09.400]  drive migration surges into both of our continents so it's it however you know they need to they
[2:25:09.400 --> 2:25:13.880]  spend this agenda to make sure that we're on the notice that there will be millions of migrants
[2:25:13.880 --> 2:25:19.000]  coming into our countries whether we like it or not oh yeah this footage this is actually i believe
[2:25:19.000 --> 2:25:24.120]  this is spain um and so they they can't find a way to patrol those beaches when they have
[2:25:24.840 --> 2:25:29.160]  hundreds of foreigners pouring in but they can find a way to to bust you you and your family if
[2:25:29.160 --> 2:25:33.800]  you're not wearing masks on the beach a lot of this is mixed in with greece who actually did
[2:25:33.800 --> 2:25:38.600]  fight for a while italy stood up for a while but then italy had a communist government put
[2:25:38.600 --> 2:25:42.760]  back in charge recently absolutely and they are starting to take far more migrants again
[2:25:42.760 --> 2:25:46.680]  and a lot of these migrants they are known to be infected with coronavirus they'll be out on
[2:25:46.680 --> 2:25:51.560]  these ships on the ngo ships out of the mediterranean and uh and and at first there'll be a little bit
[2:25:51.560 --> 2:25:55.560]  of pushback from the government so i'll say no we can't take this next boatload but then the the
[2:25:55.560 --> 2:25:59.480]  captain's on board or the or the people that are working on they'll say oh there's a bunch of migrants
[2:25:59.480 --> 2:26:03.480]  that are they're very sick or they're trying to commit suicide you have to let us in this is an
[2:26:03.480 --> 2:26:08.680]  emergency and so they always do find a way to land these boats with with hundreds of migrants and
[2:26:08.680 --> 2:26:12.840]  now it's happening across the english channel across english english channel that was the footage
[2:26:12.840 --> 2:26:16.760]  that you were just rolling there nigel farage he's been documenting this he's really been a hero
[2:26:16.760 --> 2:26:22.200]  about this we have we have already hit a record for the year i believe and we're only about halfway
[2:26:22.200 --> 2:26:26.920]  through now of course for the amount of migrants that are coming across the the channel there from
[2:26:26.920 --> 2:26:32.680]  france into the uk farage is projecting that on the current pace that they're on they might have
[2:26:32.680 --> 2:26:37.080]  seven thousand reach by the end of the year and that's just the known numbers that's just the
[2:26:37.080 --> 2:26:42.200]  ones that they record farage has also done a great job of documenting the fact that the french navy
[2:26:42.200 --> 2:26:48.360]  and the uk border force are cooperating with each other to basically guide the migrants into
[2:26:48.360 --> 2:26:53.160]  uk water and then the border force will pick them up and load them onto ships and bring them over
[2:26:53.160 --> 2:26:57.800]  to the shore and the amount of migrants coming over is so heavy at this point that they have
[2:26:57.800 --> 2:27:03.000]  charter buses big coach buses waiting for them but then when he goes to the coastline and shows it
[2:27:03.000 --> 2:27:07.640]  the police later this is on the news come to his house like he's a criminal even though journalism
[2:27:07.640 --> 2:27:12.200]  is a quote essential under their own rules right exactly all color of law so a former member of the
[2:27:12.200 --> 2:27:16.920]  uu parliament british parliament could have been the prime minister one of the top people in europe
[2:27:16.920 --> 2:27:21.160]  he doesn't have rights but the illegal aliens do exactly and that should worry everyone if
[2:27:21.160 --> 2:27:26.120]  someone as powerful as nigel farage doesn't have the ability to just go and report what the initial
[2:27:26.120 --> 2:27:30.760]  reports he was doing he was merely standing near near the ports a gentleman well spoken
[2:27:30.760 --> 2:27:35.320]  and now they're trying to the adl's trying to shut him up let's let's go over this here's the
[2:27:35.320 --> 2:27:41.320]  united nations this is in full wars two years ago paul joseph watson revealed un planned to flood
[2:27:41.320 --> 2:27:46.600]  america with 600 million migrants and then the news came out and said it was false even though
[2:27:46.600 --> 2:27:52.040]  they admit it was true they said well but they don't really mean it un migration packed crumbles
[2:27:52.040 --> 2:27:56.760]  his attention drawn to disturbing replacement migration plan here is the migration plan from
[2:27:56.760 --> 2:28:03.960]  the un's own website saying exactly what we just said um france says they want 230 million
[2:28:03.960 --> 2:28:08.120]  people that the new frenchman will quote be an african and again nothing against africans or
[2:28:08.120 --> 2:28:13.400]  anybody but you don't use the u the un as a weapon bringing people in then they put them on welfare
[2:28:13.400 --> 2:28:18.920]  to control them as a political weapon this is suicide and so let's talk about some of this
[2:28:18.920 --> 2:28:23.160]  because if you speak out against this facebook blocks you if you talk about it on twitter they
[2:28:23.160 --> 2:28:29.560]  do and that's under southern property law center and adl orders so here's sasha barrick cohen just
[2:28:29.560 --> 2:28:35.160]  last november the official spokesman for adl who lives behind the first amendment commits a lot of
[2:28:35.160 --> 2:28:38.680]  these things i think are crimes setting up innocent people to then you know put them on the news as
[2:28:38.680 --> 2:28:44.760]  criminals themselves here's this monster that hides behind the first amendment uh talking about how
[2:28:44.760 --> 2:28:51.000]  before they took facebook over that oh if you if you let one person organize something in berma or
[2:28:51.000 --> 2:28:56.040]  in here they're muramar or wherever we're going to blame the owner of it as if you did it even
[2:28:56.040 --> 2:28:59.640]  though if sasha barrick cohen you know has somebody that watches his movie and goes and commits a
[2:28:59.640 --> 2:29:03.400]  crime you know he's not to blame uh or he has a website somebody says i'm going to kill somebody
[2:29:03.400 --> 2:29:08.600]  on a message board you know he has he has that uh uh federal law that protects him but but he's
[2:29:08.600 --> 2:29:13.560]  saying let's go after zuckerberg if he doesn't submit this was in november zuckerberg has
[2:29:13.560 --> 2:29:19.240]  has now submitted and said that the adl and southern property law center now officially run
[2:29:19.240 --> 2:29:24.760]  and control what can be on facebook and now you see them banning bolson aro banning roger stone
[2:29:25.400 --> 2:29:33.320]  this is the tyranny that we now live under here it is and maybe fines are not enough maybe it's time
[2:29:34.440 --> 2:29:41.800]  to tell mark zuckerberg and the ceo's of these companies you already allowed one foreign power
[2:29:41.800 --> 2:29:50.200]  to interfere in our elections you already facilitated one genocide in meanna mar do it again and you go
[2:29:50.200 --> 2:29:58.360]  to jail there is such a thing as objective truth facts do exist it comes out of your mouth and if
[2:29:58.360 --> 2:30:04.120]  these internet companies really want to make a difference they should hire enough monitors to
[2:30:04.120 --> 2:30:12.920]  actually monitor work closely with groups like the adl and the NAACP insist on facts and purge
[2:30:12.920 --> 2:30:19.000]  these lies and conspiracies from their platforms like hitler did and i'm talking about this today
[2:30:19.000 --> 2:30:25.640]  because i believe that our pluralistic democracies are on a precipice and then the next 12 months
[2:30:25.640 --> 2:30:32.120]  and the role of social media could be determinant now british voters will go to the polls while
[2:30:32.120 --> 2:30:38.920]  online conspiracies promote the despicable theory of the great replacement that white
[2:30:38.920 --> 2:30:45.960]  christians are being deliberately replaced by muslim immigrants americans will vote for president
[2:30:45.960 --> 2:30:52.680]  while trolls and bots perpetuate the the disgusting lie of a hispanic invasion
[2:30:53.960 --> 2:30:58.280]  hispanic how about open border we can't do that mexico can't have that and then there's one more
[2:30:58.280 --> 2:31:04.520]  clip let's play the clip about the evil evil alex jones here it is and that trigger outrage and fear
[2:31:04.520 --> 2:31:11.640]  it's why youtube recommended videos by the conspiracist alex jones billions of times
[2:31:12.280 --> 2:31:19.240]  it's why fake news outperforms real news because studies show that lies spread faster than truth
[2:31:19.800 --> 2:31:25.880]  and it's no surprise that the greatest propaganda machine in history has spread the oldest conspiracy
[2:31:25.880 --> 2:31:33.960]  theory in history the lie that jews are somehow dangerous as one headline put it just think what
[2:31:33.960 --> 2:31:42.600]  gerbils could have done with facebook on the internet everything can appear equally legitimate
[2:31:42.600 --> 2:31:49.160]  bright bar resembles the bbc the fictitious protocols of the elders of zion look as valid as
[2:31:49.160 --> 2:31:55.800]  an adl report you know i i'm not talking about jews here on air i'm talking about the adl an
[2:31:55.800 --> 2:32:02.200]  organization that has their spokesperson of the radio teleprompter saying purge people arrest people
[2:32:03.080 --> 2:32:09.480]  imprison people if we don't have fact checkers trained by you you're saying if you don't let us run
[2:32:09.480 --> 2:32:18.600]  and control what you say we're gonna purge you we're gonna arrest you we're gonna imprison you
[2:32:19.800 --> 2:32:24.840]  and then you start spouting off about jews in the middle of it so you can then hide behind that
[2:32:24.840 --> 2:32:31.320]  while you're calling for communist chinese style takeover unbelievable tyranny dan liman
[2:32:32.040 --> 2:32:36.280]  this is the same uh this is the same way they try to silence anyone talking about george soros
[2:32:36.280 --> 2:32:41.400]  if you recall anytime you bring up soros they say that's anti-semitic uh which is just crazy
[2:32:41.400 --> 2:32:44.600]  no one ever i mean not not a lot of people i've never heard you say anything about that
[2:32:44.600 --> 2:32:49.320]  it's because george soros is evil it's because george soros is funding so many of these programs
[2:32:49.320 --> 2:32:52.840]  we know he's funding all of these district attorneys all over the country now that are
[2:32:52.840 --> 2:32:59.400]  allowing rioters i mean i mean he's evil and sasper collin is evil there are evil jews there
[2:32:59.400 --> 2:33:04.680]  are evil africans there are evil christians i mean the pope is bad but i mean sasper collin is a
[2:33:04.680 --> 2:33:10.840]  flaming authoritarian monster i mean he's the very definition of what is super deadly
[2:33:11.560 --> 2:33:15.800]  you can see it in his face uh you know people years ago would have just associated him with
[2:33:15.800 --> 2:33:22.360]  borat and uh this this comedic uh uh this he's a chameleon but that's the real guy right there
[2:33:22.360 --> 2:33:26.360]  right monster exactly that's that's what i was getting exactly look at him i mean if you if you
[2:33:26.360 --> 2:33:31.400]  saw like that walking on the street you wouldn't think a jew you'd think contractual right i mean
[2:33:31.400 --> 2:33:36.440]  you'd think you know runs with the hills he has a monster just look at that monster god

[2:36:49.720 --> 2:36:55.080]  not just the biggest story in info wars history but one of the biggest stories period the state of
[2:36:55.080 --> 2:37:03.640]  texas confirms that the cdc and nih have created a system where anyone that has the sore throat
[2:37:03.640 --> 2:37:10.760]  or a runny nose or who has been in contact with someone covet 19 is then added into the database
[2:37:10.760 --> 2:37:16.680]  as having a case and is counted as a case of covet 19 it's in the nih documents it's at the state
[2:37:16.680 --> 2:37:22.520]  level but in texas we're not confirming it's in other states this is beyond the other smoking
[2:37:22.520 --> 2:37:27.080]  guns of them putting people the die gun shop wounds and stuff in the covet column and the
[2:37:27.080 --> 2:37:34.440]  false positive test that's all huge this is beyond that mega criminal activity and we've got these
[2:37:34.440 --> 2:37:38.920]  ever county commission videos where they're just freaking out over it saying what in the world
[2:37:38.920 --> 2:37:48.280]  is this the full video is posted at band on video get it out expose the hoax you're listening to the
[2:37:48.280 --> 2:37:54.520]  alex jones show
[2:37:59.480 --> 2:38:03.720]  we are back live i'm your host alex jones dan lineman's with us for a few more segments
[2:38:03.720 --> 2:38:09.000]  we have a special guest host coming up i'll tell you about the moment but listen the adl has tried
[2:38:09.000 --> 2:38:16.120]  to bait me for years to come out and say that the new world order is a jewish conspiracy i don't
[2:38:16.120 --> 2:38:23.160]  believe that i don't want to make this about one religion or or a race or a group because a lot of
[2:38:23.160 --> 2:38:27.000]  the leftist globalist system even wants to get rid of israel they openly say that you know they say
[2:38:27.000 --> 2:38:32.280]  trumps and any semi the adl's come out and attack the president the adl just like big tech just like
[2:38:32.280 --> 2:38:38.760]  all these other big corporate front groups wants control of knowledge and they all know well we
[2:38:38.760 --> 2:38:43.960]  had a war with the nazis and americans you don't know those are the bad guys so if we call americans
[2:38:43.960 --> 2:38:50.040]  nazis and say america sucks we can be the boss over language that's the left in general so the
[2:38:50.040 --> 2:38:57.560]  adl wants open borders the adl you know you know uh just absolutely i see as a global organization
[2:38:58.120 --> 2:39:01.160]  but the fact that now they're front and center it used to be something for every law center
[2:39:01.720 --> 2:39:06.360]  saying we're the policemen we control and having their spokesperson say it's not just him they
[2:39:06.360 --> 2:39:11.480]  say we want to arrest you for your speech now i mean this is really dangerous authoritarianism
[2:39:11.480 --> 2:39:16.360]  and uh you know they've got a 501c deal uh that they just got a big bail out the southern
[2:39:16.360 --> 2:39:19.320]  poverty law center needs to be criminally investigated they've got hundreds of millions
[2:39:19.320 --> 2:39:23.080]  offshore these are just really un-american groups i don't care whether it's the southern
[2:39:23.080 --> 2:39:27.560]  poverty law center or what the n double acp is turned into n double acp is another as a communist
[2:39:27.560 --> 2:39:32.200]  organization nothing to do with black people dan absolutely you know that they're shutting down
[2:39:32.200 --> 2:39:37.400]  our speech and and they they use the you know these slurs against us but you know they accuse us of
[2:39:37.400 --> 2:39:41.640]  being nazis and all that but the other one's really behaving like that in that authoritarian
[2:39:41.640 --> 2:39:45.720]  uh strain where they're just silencing and crushing all this stuff about purging people
[2:39:45.720 --> 2:39:49.320]  right exactly and you know and people like us we just want we would like liberty
[2:39:49.320 --> 2:39:54.920]  an open dialogue open conversation the ability to say as we please and have peaceful conversations
[2:39:54.920 --> 2:39:59.480]  although he's trying to get people to attack jews in general that's what the adl does so
[2:39:59.480 --> 2:40:03.800]  they can be the representative and then quote milk everybody but jews are smart they've really
[2:40:03.800 --> 2:40:08.200]  woken up the adl that's why in foxman had to go they lost a bunch of lawsuits calling people
[2:40:08.200 --> 2:40:13.240]  you know any semi to try to be jewish right exactly so we'll keep going sorry no no no that's
[2:40:13.240 --> 2:40:18.440]  uh that's about a wrap so well well let's get more into all these articles and your report
[2:40:18.440 --> 2:40:23.240]  from europe about what's really happening sure uh you were mentioning about how macron has actually
[2:40:23.240 --> 2:40:28.840]  been on record saying that the future of europe and and africa are are one he says basically and he
[2:40:28.840 --> 2:40:34.840]  has talked about bringing in 200 he espoused the idea that 250 million migrants over the next 30 years
[2:40:34.840 --> 2:40:39.800]  seems pretty reasonable i said 30 i went from a lower member what's the actual articles i
[2:40:39.800 --> 2:40:45.160]  believe that it's 250 on red guys pull it up macron bringing 250 million migrants to france
[2:40:45.160 --> 2:40:51.240]  france's future is 250 million migrants from from from from africa by what 2040 i believe
[2:40:51.240 --> 2:40:58.120]  within the next 30 years so by 2050 and maybe by 2040 maybe it's 230 by 2040 so and the the sheer
[2:40:58.120 --> 2:41:02.440]  number of that i mean just if it was people from from norway bringing in 200 there's not even 100
[2:41:02.440 --> 2:41:07.160]  million in france right exactly so and what we're seeing starting to happen now in france and and
[2:41:07.160 --> 2:41:13.400]  other european countries is that the they're we're having starting to see warfare tribal warfare
[2:41:13.400 --> 2:41:18.680]  between different islamic groups and different groups of migrants so recently you had in multiple
[2:41:18.680 --> 2:41:25.560]  french cities uh this spark sparked off uh in the beginning in niece uh with african muslims fighting
[2:41:25.560 --> 2:41:31.240]  uh chetchen chetchen muslims exactly exactly so there was a dispute uh i guess there was one of
[2:41:31.240 --> 2:41:36.680]  the uh the chetchen youngsters uh 16 years old i guess was beaten by some uh some like moroccan
[2:41:36.680 --> 2:41:41.960]  north african migrants and chetchins from all around france descended on niece and they went
[2:41:41.960 --> 2:41:48.520]  for days uh all out warfare in the streets uh fully armed ak-47s they were crashing cars into
[2:41:48.520 --> 2:41:52.760]  each other and that warfare actually spread into other cities around france so they continued
[2:41:52.760 --> 2:41:57.480]  that on for a couple weeks and the police are totally unable to take care of this they had to
[2:41:57.480 --> 2:42:03.320]  send in basically uh military forces to bring that all down to to a cool but you see uh almost
[2:42:03.320 --> 2:42:08.040]  every week now it seems like there are riots in paris for different reasons but it's always
[2:42:08.040 --> 2:42:12.840]  migrants and antifa taking advantage of that chaos and the un knows this and has done it by design
[2:42:13.400 --> 2:42:18.040]  absolutely and they love to see this discord being sown in european and the vatican wants it to
[2:42:18.040 --> 2:42:22.600]  talk about evil again not against catholics when i attack the pope it's like when i attack the adl
[2:42:22.600 --> 2:42:26.840]  saying put purge everybody and arrest everybody for their speech that's not jews they don't and
[2:42:26.840 --> 2:42:30.920]  most catholics i know are great and the pope doesn't speak for them he said europe shouldn't
[2:42:30.920 --> 2:42:35.800]  have walls saying it's christian makes him nauseous we should open up but the vaticans got 200 foot
[2:42:35.800 --> 2:42:41.960]  walls right and he he's he's videos of him washing migrants feet and and spreading that
[2:42:41.960 --> 2:42:47.080]  propaganda but meanwhile of course like like you said he lives behind walls um and so kind of going
[2:42:47.080 --> 2:42:51.720]  along that whole same theme we have those those that kind of warfare spreading throughout french
[2:42:51.720 --> 2:42:56.120]  cities but we also have it moving into uh cities across europe and i think that they're taking their
[2:42:56.120 --> 2:43:00.680]  cues in many ways from what's happening in the united states and very inspired by that and basically
[2:43:00.680 --> 2:43:05.480]  this black lives matter um movement has spread across europe as well so you have the soros is
[2:43:05.480 --> 2:43:09.080]  funding it's another color revolution it's like he funded the ukrainian overthrow it's on record
[2:43:09.080 --> 2:43:13.880]  right exactly so recently we had in stuttgart they had the they said the worst riots they've seen
[2:43:13.880 --> 2:43:19.240]  uh maybe ever they had migrants and antifa running wild in the streets smashing up the
[2:43:19.240 --> 2:43:24.120]  entire downtown you have similar situations playing out in belgium netherlands it seems
[2:43:24.120 --> 2:43:28.360]  like every week there's a new city that pops up and sometimes you didn't even realize you never
[2:43:28.360 --> 2:43:31.640]  heard of the city and all of a sudden they have hundreds it's just the new normal and tens of
[2:43:31.640 --> 2:43:36.280]  thousands of years stab murdered rape and it's just no big deal exactly and and very little
[2:43:36.280 --> 2:43:40.120]  of it gets reported and when it does get reported we don't get a lot of information about who the
[2:43:40.120 --> 2:43:46.440]  culprits are when it's but more and more high-level uh former french prime minister uh high-level
[2:43:46.440 --> 2:43:51.240]  intellectuals even famous liberals are coming out saying look this is suicide europe's almost
[2:43:51.240 --> 2:43:56.920]  dead this is total collapse this is not you it's got to stop exactly you have uh ericsson more who's
[2:43:56.920 --> 2:44:01.960]  a very well-known dissident uh author and uh and journalist and he has basically said that they
[2:44:01.960 --> 2:44:06.440]  that they really need to do something about this because because france is essentially lost in many
[2:44:06.440 --> 2:44:10.200]  areas and right after he delivered one of these interviews recently he was actually attacked
[2:44:10.200 --> 2:44:14.120]  in the street by migrants so i mean it's just like the prophecy fulfilled itself
[2:44:16.280 --> 2:44:20.040]  how much will people put up with an america we're cucking just like europeans
[2:44:20.040 --> 2:44:24.680]  i think it's because we have spectators with tv and the iphone we just can't ever imagine actually
[2:44:24.680 --> 2:44:29.880]  doing something that's a good question i am really am shocked the way that that americans have rolled
[2:44:29.880 --> 2:44:35.160]  over for the the masks at this point especially some of the other places i've been in the states
[2:44:35.160 --> 2:44:39.880]  um even more aggressively uh you know these mask laws are in place and everyone is is going
[2:44:39.880 --> 2:44:43.560]  along with it without really even questioning it even if they question it at home they don't feel
[2:44:43.560 --> 2:44:47.640]  question a comfortable questioning and they need to be challenged out in the open we've been doing
[2:44:47.640 --> 2:44:52.280]  that because they need to be educated and let other people know you're accepting the the tracking
[2:44:53.000 --> 2:44:59.720]  the contact tracers the force inoculation that is the plan you must say no absolutely and another
[2:44:59.720 --> 2:45:03.160]  thing that i've noticed about what's going on with the way that they're pushing and pulling
[2:45:03.160 --> 2:45:07.320]  with the coronavirus lockdowns is it seems like they they you know they kind of give us a little
[2:45:07.320 --> 2:45:11.560]  bit more ground to give it back but then when they take back they take more more than they had
[2:45:11.560 --> 2:45:15.560]  then they had well that was always predicted it's the exact formula right exactly and uh so i think
[2:45:15.560 --> 2:45:19.160]  people need to watch out for that because people started getting complacent when things started
[2:45:19.160 --> 2:45:22.680]  getting reopened again and all of a sudden when they when they dropped the hammer again they took
[2:45:22.680 --> 2:45:26.680]  back more than they had originally in in the previous lockdown so people that's right you
[2:45:26.680 --> 2:45:32.040]  must go out and expose that it's massive testing false positives and that they're hiding things
[2:45:32.040 --> 2:45:36.040]  that for people that do have this autoimmune response because it is real the virus is real
[2:45:36.040 --> 2:45:40.520]  it's been engineered it's designed to spread really easy so everybody has it to everybody's
[2:45:40.520 --> 2:45:45.800]  suspect and then if you're really deficient in things and old it causes an autoimmune response
[2:45:45.800 --> 2:45:50.280]  in the lungs normally viruses like that do it in young people this is very weird because it doesn't
[2:45:50.280 --> 2:45:54.760]  old people it's a very strange virus we're not sure they're in-game with it but i believe it's
[2:45:54.760 --> 2:45:59.800]  a real virus in fact we know it is but we know it's very weak when it comes to killing you very
[2:45:59.800 --> 2:46:04.920]  strong and spreading the perfect thing to keep everybody scared and we do know that the testing
[2:46:04.920 --> 2:46:09.480]  even is is very strange on the cdc website which i'm sure you've covered they even say that if you
[2:46:09.480 --> 2:46:14.440]  test positive for coronavirus you don't necessarily have the covid 19 coronavirus you might have had
[2:46:14.440 --> 2:46:20.280]  a coronavirus a common cold that's almost all of it right yes and that's on the cdc website so if
[2:46:20.280 --> 2:46:24.600]  that doesn't really blow up the whole narrative just that one little passage there on the website
[2:46:24.600 --> 2:46:28.840]  i don't know what would well that's why they chose to make a genetically modified corona
[2:46:28.840 --> 2:46:32.760]  that's why they can never make a vaccine for a corona because it's so common and so it's the
[2:46:32.760 --> 2:46:37.960]  perfect thing where it never is going to end now they're going to count all deaths as corona forever
[2:46:37.960 --> 2:46:42.120]  and they've said even a vaccine won't fix it it's just it never ends we just can't let it kill us
[2:46:42.120 --> 2:46:47.320]  and it'll all but no drugs that actually cure it like that can be allowed no vitamins no minerals
[2:46:47.320 --> 2:46:53.960]  uh you know no uh steroids no nothing you can't have any of it you really have to wonder when
[2:46:53.960 --> 2:46:57.720]  when when are people going to have said this is enough is enough because i'll tell you when they
[2:46:57.720 --> 2:47:02.360]  say it no one's going to get in trouble when this hoax gets defeated we'll fight like everything it'll
[2:47:02.360 --> 2:47:07.000]  be horrible they'll get some ground we'll push them back and then they'll just do the next hoax
[2:47:07.000 --> 2:47:11.560]  the next hoax they never got in trouble for russia gate ukraine gate this race war gate you know
[2:47:11.560 --> 2:47:16.360]  this the covid 19 gate it's just never ends not only that but as soon as things seem to feel like
[2:47:16.360 --> 2:47:19.800]  they're they're calming down with the coronavirus they're already talking about the next plagues
[2:47:19.800 --> 2:47:24.440]  coming out of china exactly another pig virus it's all over and gates goes this is kind of a
[2:47:24.440 --> 2:47:29.640]  simulation he said on uh colbert but he said the big one's coming and and that's it this is event
[2:47:29.640 --> 2:47:34.840]  201 event 202 203 we're just being trained to be straight jacketed so we behave ourselves and we're
[2:47:34.840 --> 2:47:39.880]  really dying right and you even have Fauci that the on record i believe it was in 2017 saying
[2:47:39.880 --> 2:47:43.800]  that there was going to be basically a big surprise a viral surprise during the trump
[2:47:43.800 --> 2:47:47.720]  administration basically said during the coming administration there will be a surprise laughing
[2:47:47.720 --> 2:47:53.000]  us don't worry trump's got a big problem on his head they're all smiling because they're in the
[2:47:53.000 --> 2:47:57.560]  in club yeah they they knew something was coming so uh we just we have to try to stay ahead of them
[2:47:57.560 --> 2:48:02.040]  and and uh educate the public and that's why we got to stay on air we got to reach more people so
[2:48:02.040 --> 2:48:07.640]  i'm pissed folks it's because i know this is going to war i don't want to go to war i want to keep
[2:48:07.640 --> 2:48:11.800]  going out of my motorboat once a month and eating cheese enchiladas and you know hanging out with
[2:48:11.800 --> 2:48:16.440]  my wife and kids but i mean i cannot sit here while that murdering criminal that literally
[2:48:16.440 --> 2:48:21.640]  owns the vaccine companies with bill gates does this you understand Fauci you understand gates
[2:48:21.640 --> 2:48:28.280]  you're not going to get away with this you murdering trash you're our enemy i see you you will pay
[2:48:28.280 --> 2:48:36.120]  season assist now you will not pass the globalist want us to domesticate they want us inside our
[2:48:36.120 --> 2:48:41.960]  homes watching our televisions and being controlled by our quote smartphones everybody knows this
[2:48:41.960 --> 2:48:46.920]  it's their admitted goal we've had whistleblowers from facebook twitter and google go public and say
[2:48:46.920 --> 2:48:52.840]  at the highest levels their job is to make you neurotic destroy your mind and take over your life
[2:48:52.840 --> 2:48:58.040]  and now the covid hysteria is all about that i recently had a woman in the street walls with
[2:48:58.040 --> 2:49:04.360]  my youngest daughter and my daughter walked close to her and she said get away six feet and gave her
[2:49:04.360 --> 2:49:10.040]  a super ugly look this ladies and gentlemen is mental illness my daughter walking four feet
[2:49:10.040 --> 2:49:16.680]  from some old woman is not a crime the old woman's mental illness is the crime if we give in to it
[2:49:16.680 --> 2:49:24.040]  this is total and complete mind control we must expose the covid hoax now they're going to continue
[2:49:24.040 --> 2:49:28.840]  to clamp down using this it's a u n bill gates plan they've been proven to be criminal liars
[2:49:28.840 --> 2:49:38.200]  and they must be defeated they must be exposed as we enter the critical months of july it is very
[2:49:38.200 --> 2:49:43.880]  important for listeners and viewers to understand that all of the major storable food companies
[2:49:43.880 --> 2:49:51.160]  have been sold out of food for months my patriot supply our supplier was out to an eight week wait
[2:49:51.160 --> 2:49:55.160]  not because they didn't have food but because their four plants were backed up packaging and
[2:49:55.160 --> 2:50:01.800]  getting it out now they are at three to four weeks right now they've gotten over the hump their other
[2:50:01.800 --> 2:50:07.960]  competitors are completely sold out or selling old garbage this is high quality food i would advise
[2:50:07.960 --> 2:50:13.400]  everyone to do what i'm doing and buy more storable food now before the next big hump comes
[2:50:13.400 --> 2:50:18.440]  because if you think things are about to settle down think again the world is only going to get
[2:50:18.440 --> 2:50:22.040]  more insane i've been telling you this for six months ladies and gentlemen if you don't have
[2:50:22.040 --> 2:50:25.240]  firearms and ammo and water filtration you better get it you don't have storable food
[2:50:25.240 --> 2:50:29.560]  you better get it go to infowarstore.com to take care of the water filtration and to take care of
[2:50:29.560 --> 2:50:38.280]  the storable foods get your orders in now before the next big rush you're listening to the alex

[2:51:07.720 --> 2:51:13.400]  feel yeah today actually some of it's been out of control okay because as a normal human with
[2:51:13.400 --> 2:51:18.440]  normal instincts and normal in intellectual capabilities we're literally being conquered in
[2:51:18.440 --> 2:51:23.160]  a globalist war and people are running around submitting like morons there's a big article
[2:51:23.160 --> 2:51:27.960]  out from dissident voice the master's symbol of subjugation big report on bandod video dealing
[2:51:27.960 --> 2:51:31.640]  with all that dan liman will be back in her tomorrow with elin shroyer there's a good chance
[2:51:31.640 --> 2:51:35.720]  i'll be here too i've got a family thing that came up but it might not be happening now
[2:51:35.720 --> 2:51:39.800]  got a deal to help some family out but i'm going to come in here this saturday and do a special
[2:51:39.800 --> 2:51:43.160]  live report or a tape report i'm not sure which one but look for that during the afternoon
[2:51:43.160 --> 2:51:48.040]  i'll be with the sunday show always four to six p.m while we're still here remember around the
[2:51:48.040 --> 2:51:54.040]  clock the democratic party suing us black ops fake investigations you know millers had me under
[2:51:54.040 --> 2:51:58.840]  criminal investigation that's still ongoing even though he's gone uh harassment of my family and
[2:51:58.840 --> 2:52:04.600]  i'm not bitching i'm just here to tell you this is a war and you're the target you could be old
[2:52:04.600 --> 2:52:10.280]  young black white if you're intelligent you want western culture you're a christian you're the enemy
[2:52:10.280 --> 2:52:14.280]  dan liman in the four minutes three minutes we have left other key points you'd like to hit and
[2:52:14.280 --> 2:52:18.920]  solutions or other things you're doing over at your reports dot com sure you know going along
[2:52:18.920 --> 2:52:24.520]  with that point the way that they're that everything is under attack and including the progress of
[2:52:24.520 --> 2:52:29.720]  western civilization at this point so you have um everyone getting behind masks now which is just
[2:52:29.720 --> 2:52:35.000]  totally bizarre so it's very chai chai calm thing right and you know i i think it's funny that
[2:52:35.000 --> 2:52:38.840]  you know a lot of people have been worried about let's say the the advancement of the islamic
[2:52:38.840 --> 2:52:43.880]  agenda and the promotion of the hijab trying to get women into hijabs or even further into
[2:52:43.880 --> 2:52:48.840]  other islamic garb but now you have both sexes everybody hidden behind masks and so i'd say
[2:52:48.840 --> 2:52:53.880]  that in in some ways that the agenda has has superseded uh that that previous agenda with
[2:52:53.880 --> 2:52:58.280]  the masks and all that but uh going back to the point of just the way that that the way that
[2:52:58.280 --> 2:53:03.480]  progress is being rolled back um you have so many things that are being kind of pushed upon us
[2:53:04.120 --> 2:53:09.400]  and have a great example right here the berlin transit authority recently urged riders to
[2:53:09.400 --> 2:53:14.760]  forego deodorant so that it would force people who tend to wear the mask underneath the nose to get
[2:53:14.760 --> 2:53:18.680]  a little better breathing on while they're on the trains to it would force them to cover their
[2:53:18.680 --> 2:53:25.080]  entire face because the smell would be so encouraging people to harass folks exactly and also to just
[2:53:25.080 --> 2:53:29.480]  to be offensive to smell offensive to you know to look because be ugly be dirty that's young
[2:53:29.480 --> 2:53:33.240]  right exactly so and then you know that's a leftist agenda what is it about the left
[2:53:33.240 --> 2:53:37.080]  that they want people to be filthy and dirty and ugly just so no one respects themselves
[2:53:37.080 --> 2:53:41.240]  they can run over you they worship at the altar of ugliness and they i might start wearing like
[2:53:41.240 --> 2:53:45.160]  fancy suits all the time just to piss them off yeah take it all and take it in the opposite
[2:53:45.160 --> 2:53:49.560]  direction of course um yeah you know i mean all these antifa all of them everyone these people
[2:53:49.560 --> 2:53:54.440]  that are camping out in these autonomous zones quote on quote or in in the park in front of uh
[2:53:54.440 --> 2:53:58.920]  in front of um city hall in new york city this is filthy behavior if you're trying to stop the
[2:53:58.920 --> 2:54:03.160]  spread of a virus people shouldn't be sleeping in tents on the street but the news said it's helping
[2:54:03.160 --> 2:54:08.120]  fight covid that's the uh the new uh that's a tactic psychologically though they're like
[2:54:08.120 --> 2:54:12.760]  juxtapose things and have oxymorons on purpose to make you give up yeah i think they really are
[2:54:12.760 --> 2:54:16.440]  trying to drive us crazy you know one of the one of the laws in in many states now is you have to
[2:54:16.440 --> 2:54:19.880]  wear the mask into the restaurant but then you take it off when you sit at the table but then
[2:54:19.880 --> 2:54:24.680]  you put it back on when you go to the bathroom i mean this is like it creates it's all stand on top
[2:54:24.680 --> 2:54:29.800]  of your head and stick your finger in your room absolutely i mean it's just it's just or it's more
[2:54:29.800 --> 2:54:34.680]  on behavior it's it's like jump one foot in the air and slap yourself in the nose i mean it's it's
[2:54:34.680 --> 2:54:39.640]  at the it's cult programming cults have people do this and look like the marine corps is a cult
[2:54:39.640 --> 2:54:43.400]  but it was for war and it's what they have the guys do dumb stuff too just to see of the
[2:54:43.400 --> 2:54:48.600]  follow orders and but but that's for military cult for a reason this is a cult to go under
[2:54:48.600 --> 2:54:54.280]  communism they're trying to record telling you to cut your son's cock off that they're they're
[2:54:54.280 --> 2:54:58.680]  trying to break our will and to also just to break our ability to say no and to just keep us always
[2:54:58.680 --> 2:55:03.240]  on our toes keep us guessing about what comes next what's the new rule what's the old and instead
[2:55:03.240 --> 2:55:06.840]  we should you know that's the answer talk about it tomorrow when you're on what you think about
[2:55:06.840 --> 2:55:11.800]  this we need to get them off balance and stop submitting in different ways all sorts of stuff
[2:55:11.800 --> 2:55:16.440]  i think before it gets physical we've got to start going into the civil disobedience realm
[2:55:16.440 --> 2:55:21.000]  europe wars dot com you're still on twitter how do people are you still on twitter still am for

[2:56:50.520 --> 2:56:56.520]  this is j dire of j's analysis and i'm hosting the fourth hour of the alex jones show welcome back
[2:56:56.520 --> 2:57:03.400]  you know i thought today we would talk about some philosophical and spiritual topics at the same
[2:57:03.400 --> 2:57:10.920]  time i want to talk about nihilism the philosophy of our age and i'm going to tell you what nihilism
[2:57:10.920 --> 2:57:15.960]  is and we're going to talk about a book that's really good on this that's really brief but i
[2:57:15.960 --> 2:57:20.760]  remember many many years ago about 20 years ago i went to this country church out in the middle of
[2:57:20.760 --> 2:57:27.800]  nowhere i remember this preacher stood up and he's and he had that that that georgia
[2:57:27.800 --> 2:57:35.160]  judge like a southern judge drawl you know he said he said we've got a peep we've got people out here
[2:57:36.040 --> 2:57:43.400]  in the country of america god's nation and they are erecting they are erecting altars to to lucifer
[2:57:43.400 --> 2:57:49.880]  to the devil and we're going to see more of this erecting altars to and and probably even
[2:57:49.880 --> 2:57:56.200]  even woose right and it just poured out like like sap right like molasses coming out of that
[2:57:56.760 --> 2:58:03.880]  out of that whatever tree molasses comes out of the molasses tree and i remember sitting
[2:58:03.880 --> 2:58:09.480]  in the in the crowd and i was thinking this is crazy what i was you know 20 21 year old
[2:58:10.280 --> 2:58:15.400]  wild boy i thought what is this this is crazy there's not going to be altars to the devil and
[2:58:15.400 --> 2:58:23.720]  this is nonsense and then here we are what 20 years later 2020 and we've got open groups out there
[2:58:23.720 --> 2:58:32.200]  openly erecting altars to the devil in a melacle you see so i have to give props to that old country
[2:58:32.200 --> 2:58:38.440]  preacher he was actually right about some things 20 years ago but i mentioned a book this book is
[2:58:38.440 --> 2:58:46.520]  called nihilism and it's written by an orthodox philosopher and his name is uh sarah from rose
[2:58:46.520 --> 2:58:53.960]  and he wanted to analyze what he thought was the the zeitgeist okay not that goofy movie the spirit
[2:58:53.960 --> 2:59:00.840]  of the time right the zeitgeist of our era and he thought that you could trace it back to these
[2:59:00.840 --> 2:59:05.640]  kind of jacob and revolutionaries you've heard the alex mentioned you know jacob ends illuminati
[2:59:05.640 --> 2:59:12.040]  this kind of stuff and there's absolutely documented evidence approved for this when you go and read
[2:59:12.040 --> 2:59:19.400]  these philosophers actual writings i had a a professor who specialized in that in my undergrad
[2:59:19.400 --> 2:59:23.640]  and we actually went in we actually read you know a lot of these original manuscripts and texts from
[2:59:23.640 --> 2:59:28.440]  these guys the official history a lot of it's actually public too it's not like people think
[2:59:28.440 --> 2:59:34.200]  oh that's a conspiracy theory no actually there's a wealth of information in mainline scholars about
[2:59:34.200 --> 2:59:39.640]  you know the bavarian illuminati and this kind of stuff anyway it's this radical revolutionary
[2:59:39.640 --> 2:59:45.160]  philosopher uh philosophy that was even wilder you know than anything else that we saw in you
[2:59:45.160 --> 2:59:48.840]  know the american revolutionary thing like that they were like the the communists of their time and
[2:59:48.840 --> 2:59:53.960]  as i mentioned in past uh segments with alex they were influenced by plateaus republic right
[2:59:55.560 --> 3:00:01.560]  well what happens with this radical revolutionary philosophy is the idea that we don't want kings
[3:00:01.560 --> 3:00:06.920]  we don't want none of that stuff we don't want democracy who's going to run all the stuff right
[3:00:06.920 --> 3:00:11.480]  who's going to be the big boy the big chief at the top of the totem pole running things in society
[3:00:11.480 --> 3:00:18.840]  well we need philosopher kings and uh shocker who do you think plato put at the top of running
[3:00:18.840 --> 3:00:26.280]  everything the philosopher as the king right so if we have philosopher kings the idea runs
[3:00:26.280 --> 3:00:33.080]  then everything will function logically it'll be ideal right plateaus said uh what we got to do is
[3:00:33.080 --> 3:00:40.600]  is pick out elite kids from the you know guardian class which is the communist class on the platonic
[3:00:40.600 --> 3:00:45.960]  pyramid there that's the there's three three tiers to the plateau pyramid you got the proletariat
[3:00:45.960 --> 3:00:51.960]  worker masses and then you got the guardian class of communist soldiers and then at the top you got
[3:00:51.960 --> 3:00:57.880]  the the philosopher king elite and plateau thought we could draw out of the lower classes somebody
[3:00:57.880 --> 3:01:01.720]  take them stick them on a mountain for about 30 years make them do a bunch of math homework
[3:01:01.720 --> 3:01:07.480]  literally just end up they're doing math homework studying geometry and then you come down the mountain
[3:01:07.480 --> 3:01:13.400]  right plateaus not a guru in the sense of like a yogi rolling around in filth plateau thought you
[3:01:13.400 --> 3:01:19.480]  come down from the mountain and then you take all that math and you stamp it into the city state
[3:01:19.480 --> 3:01:25.880]  you force the city state into this perfect ideal republic as best you can right there's always going
[3:01:25.880 --> 3:01:31.480]  to be players hustlers right there's always going to be black ops you can never get rid of everything
[3:01:32.040 --> 3:01:35.800]  bad plateau wasn't an idealist in the sense that he thought you would actually get this
[3:01:35.800 --> 3:01:44.600]  perfect society but he did think that you could shoot for it right so this elite philosopher
[3:01:44.600 --> 3:01:51.080]  guy comes down after studying and then he's got a stamp on to society on to the city state this
[3:01:51.800 --> 3:01:59.880]  mathematical ideal now you what do you think might come out of that mathematics technique the greeks
[3:01:59.880 --> 3:02:08.040]  talked a lot about technique technocracy you see it originates in the ancient greeks right in
[3:02:08.040 --> 3:02:15.560]  platonism now on paper this sounds good right if you're uh uh got a little dose of tizm right
[3:02:15.560 --> 3:02:21.240]  got a little dose of that tism then you might think oh that's perfect why don't we all do that
[3:02:21.240 --> 3:02:26.600]  yes let's have me the king autist as the head of the society and i'll run everything perfectly
[3:02:27.480 --> 3:02:33.400]  but if you know about that you can't have a spurred society you can't have a spurred empire because
[3:02:33.400 --> 3:02:40.600]  the world doesn't work on the ideals right the world works on reality and reality is in flux
[3:02:41.400 --> 3:02:47.960]  reality is not perfect right there are ideals that we can shoot for you but every one of the
[3:02:47.960 --> 3:02:57.080]  utopian communist type societies from revolutionary france and the jacobins all the way up to any of
[3:02:57.080 --> 3:03:03.640]  the revolutions the last few centuries that tried to enact these utopias the problem is that they
[3:03:03.640 --> 3:03:09.480]  didn't take into account the real world right that you can't stamp into a world that is in the
[3:03:09.480 --> 3:03:15.800]  process of change a perfect ideal but if you're young and dumb you can convince a bunch of young
[3:03:15.800 --> 3:03:22.280]  dummies that you can do that you see right so that's the danger in this philosophy the danger is that
[3:03:22.280 --> 3:03:26.920]  it dupes young people ideal that when you're young your ideals idealistic right you think i'm going to
[3:03:26.920 --> 3:03:32.040]  change the world right i'm going to be the king spurred and i'm going to be the god emperor
[3:03:32.040 --> 3:03:38.600]  the qizah tahrirak right i'm going to be paul moidebe but it doesn't work that way because the world
[3:03:38.600 --> 3:03:45.000]  is more complex than you think when you're 1819 20 and you're brought into that kind of malice
[3:03:45.000 --> 3:03:50.600]  youth brigade type of stuff which the university absolutely teach i dealt with this for years
[3:03:50.600 --> 3:03:57.800]  when i was in the university system all these sort of crazed professors but the point here is that
[3:03:58.360 --> 3:04:04.760]  there's a philosophy that results from this attempt to constantly try to set up this perfect
[3:04:04.760 --> 3:04:13.960]  utopia and what what it leads to and ironically play though even kind of picked up on this is chaos
[3:04:13.960 --> 3:04:22.840]  anarchy right and that leads to nihilism and and and father rosa's philosophy he he actually
[3:04:22.840 --> 3:04:28.600]  assigned stages to this which i'll get into here in a minute but but basically nihilism is
[3:04:28.600 --> 3:04:33.560]  is the philosophy that there's not really any philosophy right it's it's in a way it's nichian
[3:04:33.560 --> 3:04:38.360]  niches kind of a nihilistic philosopher par excellence which is not to say that there's no
[3:04:38.360 --> 3:04:44.600]  philosophy or that there's no quote truth but it becomes a rebellion against truth and we're
[3:04:44.600 --> 3:04:49.160]  going to see some of these crazed characters of the 20th century who are nihilistic like linen
[3:04:49.960 --> 3:04:54.200]  right linen actually thought that linen would say stuff like i want to blow up the universe
[3:04:55.080 --> 3:05:01.080]  like like you thought uh uh uh you know isis or something was a terror group i mean nobody
[3:05:01.080 --> 3:05:07.320]  could talk linen linen wanted to blow up the whole damn universe right so if we think about
[3:05:07.320 --> 3:05:12.040]  these basic principles and we think about how the ideals that people wanted to set up
[3:05:13.560 --> 3:05:21.960]  when they fail they lead people to these radical crazy position nihilism now again there's a lot of
[3:05:21.960 --> 3:05:27.800]  professors and philosophers out there who who are nihilists who will say oh you're mis misinterpreting
[3:05:27.800 --> 3:05:32.360]  you know we don't think that you need to blow up everything now that's just one stage of nihilism
[3:05:32.360 --> 3:05:38.520]  that's what i'm getting at here right because there's a dark logic to these kind of atheistic
[3:05:38.520 --> 3:05:45.720]  philosophies that leads people into more and more consistency ironically i mean if you're an atheist
[3:05:45.720 --> 3:05:50.440]  nihilist materialist there's no there's not really reason why you should be consistent because you
[3:05:50.440 --> 3:05:57.400]  there's no should involved here okay should is a uh a domain of ethics right philosophy and so if
[3:05:57.400 --> 3:06:03.320]  there's no real uh universal ethical principles then you don't have to do anything there's no
[3:06:03.320 --> 3:06:08.520]  meaning in anything right i'm gonna get into more of this in the next segment but let's think about
[3:06:08.520 --> 3:06:14.120]  how this leads to what's called relativism and what is relativism relativism is the basic
[3:06:14.120 --> 3:06:18.280]  philosophical pre-substantial of the entire modern world out of all of this revolutionary
[3:06:18.280 --> 3:06:24.120]  thought and atheism which says there is no truth your truth is your truth man and my truth is my
[3:06:24.120 --> 3:06:32.440]  truth man right and whatever floats your boat right but it assumes truth to say that there's
[3:06:32.440 --> 3:06:38.680]  no truth so it's fundamentally self-refuting more on this when we come back next segment
[3:06:40.360 --> 3:06:46.280]  i am cutting the sad on friday and by monday afternoon we have to end this special because
[3:06:46.280 --> 3:06:51.000]  even though a lot of these items have been sold out and just came back in we only ordered a limited

[3:08:56.280 --> 3:09:02.680]  welcome back to the alex jones show on your guest host jay dyer daysanalysis.com
[3:09:02.680 --> 3:09:10.680]  i was going to try to have uh old sam trippley on but he was he was a little too busy so i'm just
[3:09:10.680 --> 3:09:21.000]  going to sit here and act like sam trippley i'm just kidding i love you sam trippley shout out
[3:09:21.000 --> 3:09:26.840]  to sam trippley and if you heard me talk about that dosatism that's a shout out to your boy the
[3:09:26.840 --> 3:09:35.240]  jovan out there now i was talking about the atheist approach to these things and i was talking about
[3:09:37.480 --> 3:09:42.360]  how it leads to nihilism and we were we're covering kind of has a rough outline this
[3:09:42.360 --> 3:09:49.560]  excellent book on nihilism and i remember one time when i was going to a debate many years ago
[3:09:49.560 --> 3:09:55.320]  and there was an atheist and a theist and before before the debate we're all kind of in a circle
[3:09:55.320 --> 3:10:00.280]  kind of talking and we were hashing it out with the president of i don't know atheist
[3:10:01.320 --> 3:10:06.920]  beaver beaver atheist association or whatever it was from america and he said something like
[3:10:06.920 --> 3:10:12.520]  look the reality here is that you people who believe in god you theists you're just scared
[3:10:12.520 --> 3:10:17.480]  you're just scared to admit that the entire universe cosmos ultimately is just purely
[3:10:17.480 --> 3:10:24.120]  meaningless and i sat there for a minute i said wait a minute i said so so if all the universe
[3:10:24.120 --> 3:10:29.400]  is meaningless then ultimately your life is meaningless right and that dude said yeah sure i
[3:10:29.400 --> 3:10:35.720]  don't have a problem affirming that why not so what that's what you're scared of wussy theist wuss
[3:10:36.360 --> 3:10:42.760]  and i said well if your whole life is meaningless then ultimately this debate conference thing that
[3:10:42.760 --> 3:10:50.440]  we're at is meaningless too right and he said yes dude yes exactly why can't you just own up to
[3:10:50.440 --> 3:10:54.760]  wuss and i said well if this whole debate conference is meaningless then our conversation
[3:10:54.760 --> 3:11:01.160]  right now is meaningless right and he said yes dummy and i said well if our conversation is
[3:11:01.160 --> 3:11:07.080]  meaningless then aren't also aren't your sentences and arguments meaningless and he said
[3:11:11.240 --> 3:11:17.560]  why are you playing word games exactly see see see how easy it is this stuff is built on a house
[3:11:17.560 --> 3:11:29.400]  of cards now if we notice that the atheist position that the the entire superstructure is
[3:11:29.400 --> 3:11:35.080]  built on nothing built on a house of cards then we can start to deconstruct this whole system as
[3:11:35.080 --> 3:11:39.480]  pure contradictory nonsense right before we went to the break we were talking about how
[3:11:39.480 --> 3:11:48.920]  how claiming that nothing is true is itself a self-refuting claim you see uh i only believe
[3:11:48.920 --> 3:11:55.560]  in what i can determine from my senses right we only know what comes through five cents
[3:11:55.560 --> 3:12:05.240]  empirical data many people will say really did sense data tell you that you only know
[3:12:05.240 --> 3:12:11.800]  things from sense data no it doesn't tell you look under a rock you could look in a test tube
[3:12:11.800 --> 3:12:19.320]  you look at a microscope it's never going to tell you that there are only sense datum you see
[3:12:19.320 --> 3:12:27.320]  right so that's an assumption that's not empirical it's beyond the empirical but
[3:12:27.320 --> 3:12:34.440]  the claim was claiming to claim that only sense data is what we can know so therefore it's
[3:12:34.440 --> 3:12:39.160]  fundamentally self-refuting now when you start to realize this and by the way in the first chapter
[3:12:39.160 --> 3:12:43.640]  he does the same thing what that i'm doing right here it's not that different he makes these same
[3:12:43.640 --> 3:12:47.720]  kinds of arguments and he says all these people by the way who tried to enact to these ideal
[3:12:47.720 --> 3:12:57.080]  perfect utopias they're missing some fundamental philosophical points here and when you assume
[3:12:57.080 --> 3:13:01.800]  from the outset for your worldview that there isn't a god that there's nothing higher that there's
[3:13:01.800 --> 3:13:08.040]  just sort of matter in motion anytime you then try to make truth claims and try to have ethical
[3:13:08.040 --> 3:13:14.920]  you know systems or whatever all have a secular humanist system right it doesn't work it falls
[3:13:14.920 --> 3:13:22.120]  apart why because you start to realize that there's no thing to build this on there's no
[3:13:22.120 --> 3:13:26.760]  objective truths it's all purely subjective right and so you'll hear you know atheist
[3:13:26.760 --> 3:13:30.680]  materialities kinds of people these are the people by the way who are indoctrinating everybody in
[3:13:30.680 --> 3:13:37.160]  the universities you see right now you you if you're you know working uh sally sally six pack
[3:13:37.160 --> 3:13:41.560]  and bobby soccer mom and yes i reverse that on purpose because everything's reversed now in our
[3:13:41.560 --> 3:13:45.800]  inverted world if you're working at the factory you may not interact with these uh philosopher
[3:13:45.800 --> 3:13:51.080]  philosopher creeps and weirdos but i assure you when you send your children to the universities
[3:13:51.080 --> 3:13:58.040]  they are underneath creeps and weirdos for four years straight at least okay trust me i've been
[3:13:58.040 --> 3:14:01.960]  there i try to try to tell my parents this years ago they didn't believe me they were like
[3:14:01.960 --> 3:14:06.840]  it's not that bad it's not that crazy i'm like boomer you don't even know how bad it is they
[3:14:06.840 --> 3:14:12.840]  are like i'm not i can't say i can't say on air what would would come up in college classes and
[3:14:12.840 --> 3:14:17.160]  nobody believes you until you know people film it right remember these viral videos of the last
[3:14:17.160 --> 3:14:23.800]  several years and people are like you know college is that crazy right it's it's beyond what you even
[3:14:23.800 --> 3:14:32.360]  know so even though you may not interact with these weird you know academics on the day to day
[3:14:33.160 --> 3:14:39.000]  sally six pack i assure you that at the university they are indoctrinating people consistently
[3:14:40.120 --> 3:14:45.800]  and the first thing that they do in the in the praxis of indoctrination is to try to break down
[3:14:45.800 --> 3:14:51.640]  the existing worldview framework that people came into the class with that's their first
[3:14:51.640 --> 3:14:56.200]  priority that's the first thing that the the professors do how do i break down their existing
[3:14:56.200 --> 3:15:01.080]  moral framework so the first thing that they'll try to do is indoctrinate with these kind of
[3:15:01.080 --> 3:15:06.680]  unchecked assumptions that i'm talking about like do you really know if the bible's true do you
[3:15:06.680 --> 3:15:10.600]  really know if there's anything beyond sense of data right they'll throw this stuff out there and it
[3:15:10.600 --> 3:15:15.160]  sounds kind of smart right oh well i guess science is you know done with a bunch of test tubes and
[3:15:15.160 --> 3:15:19.000]  there's blue liquids and bubbles in the tubes and i guess it's really science you there's a guy with
[3:15:19.000 --> 3:15:26.360]  a lab coat so that must be authoritative but that's the domain of natural science right that's not
[3:15:26.360 --> 3:15:30.760]  the domain of philosophy that's not the domain of the bigger questions that's the domain of the
[3:15:30.760 --> 3:15:35.720]  smaller questions i remember i had a professor one time and he wrote up on the chalkboard we only know
[3:15:36.600 --> 3:15:44.200]  what sense data tells us that was his first class the first thing was that there's an astronomy class
[3:15:44.200 --> 3:15:50.920]  and i said do you know that my sense data and i kid you know he sat there for a minute with a
[3:15:50.920 --> 3:15:55.640]  chalk up to his mouth just kind of staring off into space like space was going to give him this
[3:15:55.640 --> 3:16:01.240]  answer or something i guess if you worship space you're going to look to space right but he didn't
[3:16:01.240 --> 3:16:05.320]  have an answer and he and none of those professors ever did have an answer and that's what i'm trying
[3:16:05.320 --> 3:16:11.400]  to tell you is that it's all a house of cards you see and it's a house of cards that's intentionally
[3:16:11.400 --> 3:16:16.760]  there to make your children first atheists but atheism doesn't hold people very long right
[3:16:17.480 --> 3:16:23.160]  atheism doesn't have a hold really like it it'll last for like a phase and then the the intention
[3:16:23.160 --> 3:16:28.440]  is to take people into darker things you see and you think that's crazy when i wait a minute
[3:16:28.440 --> 3:16:33.960]  what did laurence krauss say we are you remember what laurence krauss said one of these famous
[3:16:33.960 --> 3:16:42.920]  atheist materialist physics dudes he said we're all stardust right we're all stardust what is
[3:16:42.920 --> 3:16:49.720]  what does what does ritchie dorkin say ritchie dorkin says we are all merely stardust perhaps
[3:16:49.720 --> 3:16:56.360]  in fact we are the offspring of queer aliens and we were placed here by queer pivot aliens and we
[3:16:56.360 --> 3:17:03.720]  are the dna offspring of these aliens and we must then perhaps also eat people right that's a logical
[3:17:03.720 --> 3:17:08.680]  conclusion from the dorkin's philosophy i guess he literally says that by the way he says why don't
[3:17:08.680 --> 3:17:16.760]  we speculate about eating people all right god is irrational but aliens are rational you see how
[3:17:16.760 --> 3:17:21.320]  house of cards this is that's what i'm trying to say that's what i'm trying to get across is that
[3:17:21.320 --> 3:17:27.320]  this superstructure of supposed science and these giant concrete buildings with statues of
[3:17:27.320 --> 3:17:32.200]  darwin and people out front it's erected on houses of cards that doesn't mean that scientists don't
[3:17:32.200 --> 3:17:37.800]  discover things i'm going to tell you more about that in a minute listeners are saying what i was
[3:17:37.800 --> 3:17:43.400]  privately saying the crew last night we may have just broken not just the biggest story in inforced
[3:17:43.400 --> 3:17:49.960]  history but one of the biggest stories period the state of texas confirms that the state of
[3:17:49.960 --> 3:17:58.920]  texas confirms that the cdc and nih have created a system where anyone that has a sore throat or a
[3:17:58.920 --> 3:18:06.200]  runny nose or who has been in contact with someone covet 19 is then added into the database as having
[3:18:06.200 --> 3:18:11.800]  a case that is counted as a case of covet 19 it's in the NIH documents it's at the state level we
[3:18:11.800 --> 3:18:17.240]  confirmed it texas we're not confirming it's in other states this is beyond the other smoking
[3:18:17.240 --> 3:18:21.720]  guns of them putting people to die gunshot wounds and stuff in the covet column and
[3:18:21.720 --> 3:18:28.840]  the false positive test that's all huge this is beyond that mega criminal activity and we've
[3:18:28.840 --> 3:18:33.160]  got these different county commission videos where they're just freaking out over it saying what in
[3:18:33.160 --> 3:18:37.320]  the world is this the full video is supposed to demand on video get it out expose the hoax

[3:20:58.040 --> 3:21:04.600]  welcome back to the alex jones show this is j dire and i'm dosed up on that super spurg vitality
[3:21:04.600 --> 3:21:10.120]  right now i'm hype now i was telling y'all about laurence krauss talking about star dust
[3:21:10.840 --> 3:21:16.280]  we are all made of stars now who else said that oh alistair crowley by the way said that we're all
[3:21:16.280 --> 3:21:25.160]  stardust every man is a star right did you guys ever see that interview with with ben gertzel
[3:21:25.160 --> 3:21:30.680]  when he was always a rogan man and he was like we're all just molecules man and like different
[3:21:30.680 --> 3:21:37.640]  configurations man and we're nothing else but a bunch of molecules bro like i saw this on dfd was
[3:21:37.640 --> 3:21:45.480]  right total nonsense right molecules cannot tell you anything beyond molecules and they can't even
[3:21:45.480 --> 3:21:50.600]  tell you molecules you see all of these worldviews are pure nonsense now i was talking about
[3:21:51.320 --> 3:21:56.680]  relativism i was talking about how that's kind of the basic philosophy behind
[3:21:56.680 --> 3:22:05.880]  this revolutionary atheistic philosophy that the jacobins the alumnus had right and it develops
[3:22:05.880 --> 3:22:13.160]  into these stages you've got these stages and it leads to its own dark kind of logic is what
[3:22:13.160 --> 3:22:21.400]  i'm trying to say so what do i mean by that well every worldview every systems if you study philosophy
[3:22:21.400 --> 3:22:26.520]  or systems analysis this kind of stuff you'll notice that there's a certain logic that a system has
[3:22:26.520 --> 3:22:32.440]  it it links together and connects together and every one of the parts relates in some way to the
[3:22:32.440 --> 3:22:38.680]  whole right this is true of uh computers right this is true of the different components and
[3:22:38.680 --> 3:22:45.000]  motherboard and all those terms of the screen the keys this is true of cars right a car any
[3:22:45.000 --> 3:22:49.640]  any kind of machine it's true of ecosystems and it's true of humans and it's also true of their
[3:22:49.640 --> 3:22:54.760]  schema or their worldview as we call it and philosophy that's just the view that you have of
[3:22:54.760 --> 3:22:59.720]  things right we don't have to it doesn't really matter about the fancy philosophy words that's
[3:22:59.720 --> 3:23:04.680]  not the point the point is that everybody has a worldview even if they know that word or not
[3:23:04.680 --> 3:23:11.000]  right they have some of you about ethics which is just right and wrong some view of knowledge
[3:23:11.000 --> 3:23:17.640]  can we know anything at all or not and some view of reality what exists and what doesn't exist
[3:23:18.600 --> 3:23:22.840]  now even if you're totally agnostic that's still a view right it's a view well i don't know we don't
[3:23:22.840 --> 3:23:32.600]  know nobody knows who knows but no matter what your view there's there's a something in humans
[3:23:32.600 --> 3:23:40.120]  where they over time always kind of live more and more consistent with their governing assumptions
[3:23:40.120 --> 3:23:46.760]  or their worldview and so if those assumptions are on the theistic side then you're if you
[3:23:47.400 --> 3:23:51.640]  continue with that view you're going to live more and more consistently with your theistic view if
[3:23:51.640 --> 3:23:56.520]  you're on that atheist or luciferian or whatever that darker left hand path you're going to live
[3:23:56.520 --> 3:24:00.520]  more and more consistent with that kind of view right unless you you know change or repent or
[3:24:00.520 --> 3:24:08.120]  whatever so with these two different kinds of logics or systems there's an undergirding logic
[3:24:08.120 --> 3:24:12.840]  that you will follow through with right which is just called being consistent you're going to be more
[3:24:12.840 --> 3:24:18.200]  and more consistent over time and that's why you'll see this darker and darker stuff with
[3:24:18.200 --> 3:24:22.040]  what we're seeing you know with epstein max well that kind of stuff coming out in the news
[3:24:22.040 --> 3:24:29.880]  that's just more and more degraded and degenerate versions of people living out their their worldview
[3:24:30.760 --> 3:24:37.320]  living out their governing assumptions of no god or i'm god right apotheosis that man is god or is
[3:24:37.320 --> 3:24:42.280]  his own god right self worship that's just what idolatry is is essentially worship of the self
[3:24:42.280 --> 3:24:51.000]  and so the it's not just the individual that lives this out you can also see this process in
[3:24:51.000 --> 3:24:56.600]  cultures and in civilizations right spangler he wrote famous books decline of the west where he
[3:24:56.600 --> 3:25:02.760]  talked about how entire civilizations kind of had this organic lifespan of a birth and you know
[3:25:02.760 --> 3:25:10.040]  flourishing and then death daniel the book of daniel right he has a very similar kind of analysis
[3:25:10.040 --> 3:25:16.600]  to spangler in that he saw the success of world empires these big idolatrous empires and as these
[3:25:16.600 --> 3:25:21.560]  different images at different beasts or he saw a big golden image right with these different
[3:25:21.560 --> 3:25:28.360]  sections of the image reflecting these idolatrous world empires and of course the last one was
[3:25:28.360 --> 3:25:32.680]  the roman empire under which christ was born daniel two daniel seven daniel nine
[3:25:32.680 --> 3:25:39.960]  nine that perspective shows us that there are cycles that doesn't mean all of history is purely
[3:25:39.960 --> 3:25:45.240]  cyclical right i'm not a nichian nichy thought that but there is a pattern there's a there's a
[3:25:45.240 --> 3:25:49.160]  cycle that we see in civilizations and in histories and in cultures and when we look at the west
[3:25:49.160 --> 3:25:55.240]  when we look at the post-revolutionary period and ethos of the west what we see is this movement
[3:25:55.240 --> 3:26:03.080]  towards more radical nihilistic philosophies and it started with that kind of atheistic
[3:26:03.080 --> 3:26:09.240]  jacobin type of view and it progresses over time you get these things well though so the
[3:26:09.240 --> 3:26:15.720]  naturalistic assumptions of you know evolutionary philosophy that replaces the genesis account right
[3:26:16.360 --> 3:26:23.160]  Freud comes along and Freud kind of replaces the notion of sin or violating the moral law
[3:26:23.160 --> 3:26:29.160]  with confession and you know telling your uh nasty secrets to your psychiatrist right that
[3:26:29.160 --> 3:26:35.560]  that replaces the older idea of confessing to god and then you get people like marx who
[3:26:35.560 --> 3:26:43.000]  replace the idea of what economics and human interaction is with class warfare in his day
[3:26:43.000 --> 3:26:47.960]  and then later on it becomes other kinds of identity warfare and morphs into these other
[3:26:47.960 --> 3:26:55.080]  things well eventually you get in the 20th century the rise of post modernism and the breakdown of
[3:26:55.080 --> 3:27:01.880]  all narratives because the the there's a recognition that these utopian systems these universal systems
[3:27:01.880 --> 3:27:06.920]  that people kind of cooked up and came up with doesn't matter which whether it's marxism or whatever
[3:27:06.920 --> 3:27:13.960]  they don't really work as they're classically formulated so they logically move and morph into
[3:27:13.960 --> 3:27:23.960]  the next phase or stage of their alchemical development and for the western atheist ethos
[3:27:23.960 --> 3:27:30.120]  as it adopted atheism in terms of these jacobin people i'm talking about it becomes more and more
[3:27:30.120 --> 3:27:37.080]  nihilistic great example again we look at bolshevist thinkers and philosophers so to speak
[3:27:37.080 --> 3:27:42.760]  right we think of trotskyites we think of uh uh linen as i mentioned like i want to blow up the
[3:27:42.760 --> 3:27:46.920]  universe right who comes over that what i want to blow up the universe and it's like well why
[3:27:46.920 --> 3:27:51.880]  would you want to blow it don't you want to exist no i want to fight all existence right i'm anti
[3:27:51.880 --> 3:27:58.920]  existence right and that's like the most fundamental thing to war against there was a famous author who
[3:27:58.920 --> 3:28:06.360]  i think he recently passed away umberto echo and he wrote some really fascinating fiction stories
[3:28:06.360 --> 3:28:11.720]  that are full of a lot of esoteric symbolism and whatnot a name of the rose is really good
[3:28:11.720 --> 3:28:18.600]  uh it's got like a well it's a creepy kind of setup there but this is called shone connery and he's
[3:28:18.600 --> 3:28:24.040]  there with christian slater as monks in the middle ages right name of the rose it's not that good of
[3:28:24.040 --> 3:28:29.240]  a movie but the book's really good and umberto echo puts all this esoteric stuff in his books and
[3:28:29.240 --> 3:28:33.320]  then he comes out with this famous essay i can't remember maybe it was in the new york times or
[3:28:33.320 --> 3:28:38.680]  what but there's a famous essay about meaning now you remember i was talking about atheism and
[3:28:38.680 --> 3:28:43.800]  meaning earlier right well echo writes this essay and he says look all you fellow liberals and fellow
[3:28:43.800 --> 3:28:49.720]  travelers out there he says look we gotta fight against the real quote fascism and you he says
[3:28:49.720 --> 3:28:57.480]  you think i mean uh you know dudes in boots and you know skull jackets or whatever death
[3:28:57.480 --> 3:29:04.520]  head type stuff i'm not talking about musolini ss stuff he says we need to fight against the
[3:29:04.520 --> 3:29:15.800]  real fascism get this which is truth itself now that took i mean echo had to go through a lot of
[3:29:15.800 --> 3:29:20.440]  you know processes of that left hand path and if you read his books he's very much a left hand
[3:29:20.440 --> 3:29:26.120]  path kind of person right uh who left religion left i think it was catholic left homism left all
[3:29:26.120 --> 3:29:31.880]  that stuff went into cabalism went into you know probably satanic stuff i don't know right uh and
[3:29:31.880 --> 3:29:36.680]  then he comes out of it and says you know what i see from all this we got a war against existence
[3:29:36.680 --> 3:29:42.520]  and truth itself and he cites other philosophers deloisa these different deconstructionist people
[3:29:42.520 --> 3:29:47.960]  this is what you start to notice is that as we get into the 20th century people throw off all
[3:29:47.960 --> 3:29:52.680]  grand narratives right i'm talking about at the intellectual level now on the streets the dumb
[3:29:52.680 --> 3:29:57.160]  dumb's out there like they think they're gonna set up the perfect utopia yeah but the intellectual
[3:29:57.160 --> 3:30:03.880]  class they they're beyond that they moved into the nihilistic philosophy of there are no narratives
[3:30:03.880 --> 3:30:10.280]  that we're discovering narratives are all created and since they're all created we will create the
[3:30:10.280 --> 3:30:17.400]  narrative we will create reality this is where postmodernism actually becomes magical thinking

[3:35:20.200 --> 3:35:25.560]  where you can go to my youtube channel j dire and also on twitter and instagram as well now we
[3:35:25.560 --> 3:35:32.760]  were talking about these stages of the philosophical devolution of systems and one of the things that
[3:35:33.320 --> 3:35:38.760]  rose highlights that is something from marxism is dialectics and it goes back older than you
[3:35:38.760 --> 3:35:44.440]  know marx it goes back to hagel and it goes back even to the greeks which is the idea of right back
[3:35:44.440 --> 3:35:49.880]  and forth left right black white day day and night you know all these different things can be construed
[3:35:49.880 --> 3:35:56.040]  as dialectics but in the socio-political sphere we mean dialectical opposition that's controlled and
[3:35:56.040 --> 3:36:01.800]  manipulated so the in the enlightenment period we get this outbreak and we're going to focus on
[3:36:01.800 --> 3:36:06.600]  the the jacob and stuff right the french revolutionary thinkers you know you got your
[3:36:06.600 --> 3:36:13.560]  dantons you got your rose piers you got these kind of guys uh and and marah right these are more
[3:36:13.560 --> 3:36:18.600]  radical revolutionaries they weren't all that radical in the french revolution some of the
[3:36:18.600 --> 3:36:22.920]  revolutionaries were the nobility merchant class these kinds of people so you get these two branches
[3:36:22.920 --> 3:36:29.560]  of jacobins and garondons but the really radical ones are the jacobins and they were connected to
[3:36:29.560 --> 3:36:35.080]  the illuminists right a lot of them had an illuminist philosophy that's the real illuminati
[3:36:35.720 --> 3:36:44.040]  and initially the idea was to promote just kind of a liberalism that's that that sparked off into
[3:36:44.040 --> 3:36:49.000]  the radical liberalism of the jacobins and this is like you know the total communism stuff these
[3:36:49.000 --> 3:36:56.040]  are the proto-communists back in that day and at that point you get the idea of well let's just
[3:36:56.040 --> 3:37:01.000]  demythelogize let's come up with like a new calendar let's have an atheist calendar you know
[3:37:01.000 --> 3:37:06.920]  atheist civic saints all this kind of stuff but the problem is that eventually people realize
[3:37:06.920 --> 3:37:15.080]  that there's no real undergirding like basis for any of this stuff that's being erected right so
[3:37:15.080 --> 3:37:20.760]  there's a progression where people start to doubt the atheist ideals right i mean think about the
[3:37:20.760 --> 3:37:26.680]  secular humanist manifesto this kind of stuff there's two of those i had a big debate with the
[3:37:26.680 --> 3:37:31.400]  one of the premier atheist matt dillahoney you can go watch that debate on uh on youtube and
[3:37:31.400 --> 3:37:36.440]  he's a big defender of this secular humanist thing or the manifesto but the problem is that
[3:37:36.440 --> 3:37:42.600]  eventually you realize well if atheism atheistic materialism is true right and and there's just
[3:37:42.600 --> 3:37:48.680]  matter it doesn't really matter whether you follow the secular humanist manifesto right and they'll
[3:37:48.680 --> 3:37:53.720]  say things like well but you know it would it would give everybody a better life if you just
[3:37:53.720 --> 3:38:00.200]  follow these basic ideas would it on what basis do you know what's better and especially for other
[3:38:00.200 --> 3:38:05.000]  people right i mean you're an atheist you're a subjectivist it's it's relative right so who are
[3:38:05.000 --> 3:38:11.160]  you to decide what's better maybe i want to be the god emperor right i want to be the quiz that's
[3:38:11.160 --> 3:38:16.760]  hot arrive to use the dune analogy i want to just stamp out everybody and take all of y'all's
[3:38:16.760 --> 3:38:21.640]  women to be my harem and who are you to tell me i shouldn't do that right what's true for you it's
[3:38:21.640 --> 3:38:28.120]  true for you whatever floats your boat bro i just want to be the god emperor right so you see how
[3:38:28.120 --> 3:38:35.480]  quickly that devolves it doesn't work so therefore the the secular humanist stuff is all built on
[3:38:35.480 --> 3:38:42.440]  sand and eventually the atheist materialist type people that crowd they kind of see through that
[3:38:42.440 --> 3:38:47.000]  and it moves to the next phase right and the next phase of the revolution tends to be a little more
[3:38:48.440 --> 3:38:55.800]  vicious it becomes more hardcore you get the ideas of all right now we've got to like
[3:38:55.800 --> 3:39:04.040]  uh face the reality right there's no grand narrative this is no real truth so the elite the power elite
[3:39:04.040 --> 3:39:11.560]  here we're saying they make truth quite literally uh you know we got a setup systems that will
[3:39:11.560 --> 3:39:17.640]  ultimately put the technocracy in uh we got to get rid of a lot of people uh and it's unfortunate
[3:39:17.640 --> 3:39:22.760]  but it's just the way it is right version russell has this quote where he says uh look a black death
[3:39:22.760 --> 3:39:26.600]  right we got to have a black death every few centuries why don't we have an engineered black
[3:39:26.600 --> 3:39:31.800]  death which could kind of you know trim the hedges you know what i'm saying on the human
[3:39:32.680 --> 3:39:37.480]  crowd just trim those hedges a little bit down to maybe 500 million whatever
[3:39:38.600 --> 3:39:43.720]  and it sounds bad but who cares ultimately we got a commandeer evolution we got to steer it
[3:39:43.720 --> 3:39:49.400]  he says as all of his crew said by the way and he literally says that and i think it's an impact
[3:39:49.400 --> 3:39:55.320]  of science also so yeah it is he says uh well let's have an engineered black death this kind of stuff
[3:39:56.520 --> 3:40:02.360]  now that's the the next phase where they've realized there's no grand narratives we're not
[3:40:02.360 --> 3:40:08.760]  actually going to have this utopia so we got to you know have the noble lie play does noble lie
[3:40:08.760 --> 3:40:14.040]  which is like a civic religion uh august comp you know he talks about making up a fake religion
[3:40:14.040 --> 3:40:18.520]  to satisfy the masses that's a lot of these churches are basically tools of the state
[3:40:18.520 --> 3:40:25.720]  fake religions out there fake churches he says we can have that but in the background we're you
[3:40:25.720 --> 3:40:30.760]  know we're the scientific elite we really know what's going on and it's unfortunate but we can
[3:40:30.760 --> 3:40:36.360]  still set up this kind of you know a transhumanist technocracy or whatever we can still set up this
[3:40:36.360 --> 3:40:43.800]  perfect system which will evolve to give us godhood that's the second phase of the revolution
[3:40:43.800 --> 3:40:51.400]  is this still idealistic but more realistic position than the utopian you know low iq people on the
[3:40:51.400 --> 3:40:56.760]  street types or the uh thugs or the you know the people think that they're going to set up the the
[3:40:56.760 --> 3:41:02.440]  malice the you know perfect state or whatever it's also a phase right so this next stage says well
[3:41:03.640 --> 3:41:06.920]  we got to kill everybody put the robots in let the bitch box run everything
[3:41:08.520 --> 3:41:11.880]  but then some people realize that even that doesn't really make any sense
[3:41:11.880 --> 3:41:22.360]  and so there's a darker layer level that he argues is the real operating system of the whole
[3:41:23.240 --> 3:41:29.960]  jacob and leftist left past system and he says that's a luciferian satanic nihilism
[3:41:31.080 --> 3:41:36.360]  and he argues that you know the top of that pyramid that that that glowing eyeball up there
[3:41:36.360 --> 3:41:44.600]  there that's actually satanic right and that glowing eyeball has the rest of that pyramid
[3:41:44.600 --> 3:41:49.000]  duped into thinking that at different layers they're going to get different shares they're
[3:41:49.000 --> 3:41:55.720]  going to get different pieces of the pot but even the highest layers of that are duped because at that
[3:41:55.720 --> 3:42:06.600]  top the eye hates humanity all of it and it's not going to evolve you into being a robot so that
[3:42:06.600 --> 3:42:11.560]  you can live forever you're not going to be downloaded into the cloud all this nonsense right
[3:42:12.440 --> 3:42:18.120]  by the way that's isn't that like a genie in a lamp i thought we had moved past superstition
[3:42:18.120 --> 3:42:22.360]  and now we're talking about genie worldviews like you know i'm going to download into a zip drive
[3:42:22.360 --> 3:42:27.720]  that's like a genie dude imagine you could have a lamp that's a that's a zip drive and then if you
[3:42:27.720 --> 3:42:34.200]  could download into the cloud you could literally be a genie in a lamp think about that i'm joking
[3:42:34.200 --> 3:42:42.520]  but for real if we think about how this is ultimately satanic then we realize that oh yeah
[3:42:42.520 --> 3:42:49.880]  wait a minute if i'm being told that we need to be post-human evolve past all of humanity
[3:42:49.880 --> 3:42:54.120]  and that all carbon-based life forms themselves got to go away so that we can have this new
[3:42:54.120 --> 3:42:59.400]  silicon-based life form which is what the transhumanists teach then maybe at a higher higher level
[3:43:00.040 --> 3:43:04.440]  there's actually just nothing but the destruction of the human race did you ever think about that
[3:43:05.080 --> 3:43:10.680]  what if that's really the final stage and that's kind of where uh rose goes in this book now i don't
[3:43:11.320 --> 3:43:15.800]  think he mentions transhumanism he might mention it in passing uh because this was written
[3:43:15.800 --> 3:43:20.360]  a few decades ago uh so he might have kind of been aware of it mentioned in passing he did
[3:43:20.360 --> 3:43:24.760]  mention like the Illuminati and this kind of stuff in the book he mentioned those kind of secret
[3:43:24.760 --> 3:43:30.680]  societies doing this kind of stuff in the background but what i'm getting at is what you often hear
[3:43:30.680 --> 3:43:34.760]  you know people like alex say which is that look there's higher and higher levels to this
[3:43:35.640 --> 3:43:41.160]  and some of those layers of the pyramid think that they're gonna get a share a piece of the pie
[3:43:41.160 --> 3:43:46.840]  they're going to be downloaded into the zip drive or whatever uh and that's also another level of
[3:43:46.840 --> 3:43:52.760]  deception remember albert pike said that all of the lower levels on the pyramid get deceived
[3:43:52.760 --> 3:43:57.960]  intentionally remember when he said that you think that there's not still deception even at higher levels
[3:43:59.880 --> 3:44:04.840]  i mean i've met some you know fairly prominent people people who are well studied interviewed
[3:44:04.840 --> 3:44:09.400]  some pretty prominent people who academics philosophers these kinds of people some of them
[3:44:09.400 --> 3:44:16.520]  you know smarter than me really smart people and they don't always have the full picture right you
[3:44:16.520 --> 3:44:22.440]  got to kind of get up until like a kissinger brzezinski type of level before people really
[3:44:22.440 --> 3:44:26.200]  kind of have the big picture that's what i'm trying to get out here but even that is still
[3:44:26.200 --> 3:44:31.080]  the big picture in the human domain right the geopolitical domain what i'm trying to say is
[3:44:31.080 --> 3:44:37.800]  there's a higher kind of spiritual reality that you know alex does talk about pretty consistently
[3:44:37.800 --> 3:44:42.360]  and rose talks about it in the same way where he says at that highest level the highest sort of
[3:44:43.240 --> 3:44:49.800]  initiation level you could say into the dark arts of satanism luciferianism transhumanism
[3:44:49.800 --> 3:44:58.360]  is a total anti-human anti-existence destroy this whole reality ultimately that's what i think the
[3:44:58.360 --> 3:45:04.040]  i mean satan ultimately wants that right non-being because if god is the creator author of being
[3:45:04.040 --> 3:45:10.360]  what's the highest level of rebellion against creation against god to go against being itself
[3:45:11.000 --> 3:45:16.680]  anti-being it's jay dyer from jays analysis thank you for letting me host thank you for
