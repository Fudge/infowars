[00:00.000 --> 00:19.000]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation it's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network
[00:19.000 --> 00:26.840]  Welcome to the Alex Jones Show. I'm David Knight your host here in Austin on the Sunday
[00:26.840 --> 00:33.320]  July 17th 2016 we have the news that three officers have been killed assassinated in
[00:33.320 --> 00:38.480]  Baton Rouge one suspect is dead two others are in custody we're going to be going into
[00:38.480 --> 00:44.080]  details about that the responses of various people including the head of the police union
[00:44.080 --> 00:49.080]  in Cleveland where the RNC is going to be taking place he says Obama has blood on his
[00:49.080 --> 00:53.880]  hands we're going to play you that clip and what he had to say about how Obama is pushing
[00:53.880 --> 01:00.360]  this narrative this divide and conquer this clash between different groups within our
[01:00.360 --> 01:07.120]  country turning this into as divisive a country as I've ever seen in my lifetime and the kind
[01:07.120 --> 01:10.320]  of violence that we've never seen before in our lifetime as well now we've got Alex and
[01:10.320 --> 01:14.920]  crew on their way to the RNC and transit that's why I'm here today doing the show Alex is
[01:14.920 --> 01:20.680]  on his way to Cleveland to cover the RNC we've got a report from Alex he saw none other than
[01:20.680 --> 01:27.600]  Carl Rove on his plane and they had an interesting encounter Alex went up to ask him some questions
[01:27.600 --> 01:33.640]  and you know you're not allowed to look these people our majesties are our elite in the
[01:33.640 --> 01:39.360]  eye even dare you even talk to them and so he asked him a couple of questions he's got
[01:39.360 --> 01:44.880]  the video recorder going on and Carl Rove got very frosty about it and so he turned
[01:44.880 --> 01:49.320]  it off but Carl Rove kept it going and he called the police on Alex and we'll let you
[01:49.320 --> 01:56.360]  know I'll show you that video coming up in the next segment also we have news on the
[01:56.360 --> 02:03.000]  Turkish coup we've got a lot of finger pointing going on we've got the Turkish president Erdogan
[02:03.000 --> 02:07.880]  as they put down the coup he blames the US the CIA and Fatala Gulen the Turkish Imam
[02:07.880 --> 02:12.120]  that was brought over into this country by the CIA given refuge here and they're trying
[02:12.120 --> 02:19.960]  to get him extradited of course then Syria and Gulen are kicking back against Erdogan
[02:19.960 --> 02:24.440]  saying that he faked it that it was a false flag that he just wanted to use that as an
[02:24.440 --> 02:28.520]  effort to increase the crackdown and that authoritarian regime you know he has more
[02:28.520 --> 02:33.080]  people locked up more journalists locked up than any other country in the world pretty
[02:33.080 --> 02:38.960]  much a very repressive regime a regime that he has moved from secularism to Islamification
[02:38.960 --> 02:43.680]  but we're going to take a look at the response of the United States and also most importantly
[02:43.680 --> 02:50.200]  as we look at this coup in Turkey I have to ask you are you concerned if there's an Islamic
[02:50.200 --> 02:55.680]  coup going on here in America perhaps there is perhaps it's more subtle than you ever
[02:55.680 --> 03:00.320]  imagined you know we look at the way that our education system is with common core with
[03:00.320 --> 03:05.160]  the political correctness of social justice warriors the people who come out of high school
[03:05.160 --> 03:09.360]  and college and don't know anything about the lies have been told about white privilege
[03:09.360 --> 03:13.920]  do you know where that came from of course that came from Bill Ayers and the students
[03:13.920 --> 03:17.720]  for democratic society which turned into the weather underground pushing this white skin
[03:17.720 --> 03:23.920]  privilege narrative that was invented in 1965 by another college professor but you know
[03:23.920 --> 03:27.640]  he stopped bombing buildings and he decided he would create an army of social justice
[03:27.640 --> 03:34.200]  warriors that he would take over our children we need to be very careful about who controls
[03:34.200 --> 03:40.600]  our educational system and one of the people involved perhaps in this Turkish coup certainly
[03:40.600 --> 03:45.200]  one of the figures that is there's there's Erdogan who is there and there's his former
[03:45.200 --> 03:50.640]  ally Fatala Ghulen who is now in exile in the United States they were once allies now
[03:50.640 --> 03:56.040]  they are enemies and essentially the I would say the two heads of the power interests in
[03:56.040 --> 04:01.160]  Turkey we're going to be talking to Mark Hall we've had him on once before talk to him about
[04:01.160 --> 04:07.760]  a documentary that he did killing ed killing education this is a documentary that shows
[04:07.760 --> 04:14.040]  the worst case scenario of private schools that are funded by taxpayer money we call
[04:14.040 --> 04:18.800]  those charter schools it's an open invitation to crony capitalism but he looked at something
[04:18.800 --> 04:23.160]  that was far worse in crony capitalism he looked at what's going on with the network
[04:23.160 --> 04:27.640]  of harmony schools that are tied to Fatala Ghulen here in the United States get about
[04:27.640 --> 04:32.680]  a half a billion dollars what are the values that this group is teaching us we've seen
[04:32.680 --> 04:37.520]  the results and the fruit of what Bill Ayers has done what's going to happen now as the
[04:37.520 --> 04:43.320]  Islamic people take over hundreds of our schools here in the United States teaching about 60,000
[04:43.320 --> 04:48.120]  students we're going to talk in the second hour to Mark Hall about what his research
[04:48.120 --> 04:53.440]  has uncovered and how his film has been shut down just like they shut down back at Tribeca
[04:53.440 --> 04:58.480]  his film has been shut down at film festivals all over the country we'll be right back not
[04:58.480 --> 05:02.000]  a group you develop living defense for us it took you over a year to do it why is this
[05:02.000 --> 05:06.800]  so good because people are actually waking up to the problem that pretty much scares
[05:06.800 --> 05:12.200]  me the most I mean I try to make sure that I don't put toxins from food and water and
[05:12.200 --> 05:18.160]  beverages in my system but right now we're dealing with massive parasites which is anything
[05:18.160 --> 05:22.960]  that's harmful to your body that lives off a host mechanism right now with all the refugees
[05:22.960 --> 05:28.440]  spreading disease around we have biological warfare going on everywhere these are all
[05:28.440 --> 05:31.800]  parasites tell us about all the stuff I said there's so many things that are in it you
[05:31.800 --> 05:36.720]  have the name in there you have the organic clove bud the organic wormwood I recommend
[05:36.720 --> 05:40.640]  doing a parasite cleanse at least twice a year all right well I'm glad we've got some
[05:40.640 --> 05:44.320]  back in because I'm going back on it today it just came back in yesterday living defense

[06:26.160 --> 06:29.360]  The Republican National Convention is going to be starting tomorrow in Cleveland Ohio
[06:29.360 --> 06:34.320]  Alex Jones and most of our crew on their way and we're reporting here live as Alex
[06:34.320 --> 06:39.360]  was traveling to Cleveland interestingly enough on the same plane coming out of Austin he
[06:39.360 --> 06:43.960]  saw waiting to get on the plane Carl Rove and Alex went over to talk to him here's
[06:43.960 --> 06:53.640]  a clip of what happened okay folks Carl Rove's on the same flight with us to Cleveland we're
[06:53.640 --> 07:13.840]  going to have a conversation with some friends you're filming this for your program and I
[07:13.840 --> 07:22.880]  work for fun so I'm working for fun so I'm not going to be appearing on the Alex Jones
[07:22.880 --> 07:31.560]  show and we knew that folks and normally it was a university student once again once
[07:31.560 --> 07:36.400]  again you're distorting the facts but I appreciate it and what I've told you is I'm working for
[07:36.400 --> 07:54.280]  fun so I have a if you want me to appear on your program and I know you don't think the
[07:54.280 --> 08:10.680]  conversation was great he wants to win the argument he can only win the argument was
[08:10.680 --> 08:14.400]  the controlled argument this guy's been against Trump the whole time he wants to
[08:14.400 --> 08:20.720]  siphon off the money like in 2008 and like he did in 2012 and that's what he does here
[08:20.720 --> 08:24.760]  is right here you talk to these little delegates and people the super delegates they hope they
[08:24.760 --> 08:29.720]  can get to sign off the votes we failed this guy's going as a failure to leave on the
[08:29.720 --> 08:34.360]  carnival still the election from he wouldn't talk to him for worse actually well there
[08:34.360 --> 08:38.120]  you go there'll be lots of this once we're in Cleveland we had to talk to him obviously
[08:38.120 --> 08:41.720]  and he played this whole game I thank you I waited five minutes we talked to these folks
[08:41.720 --> 08:45.520]  I knew as soon as we came over to you like these are my friends you know you're interrupting
[08:45.520 --> 08:49.720]  them while they try to talk to me well they're just my little friends this is the guy that
[08:49.720 --> 08:55.360]  supported Bush and the assault women's man this is the guy that pushed Amnesty this is
[08:55.360 --> 09:00.160]  the guy there's a global he's the people of hijacked the Republican Party the Clintons
[09:00.160 --> 09:06.720]  and the Bushes vacation together they call themselves brothers and sisters and let's
[09:06.720 --> 09:36.440]  go over and so after that he threatened to call the police on Alex
[09:36.440 --> 09:41.080]  of course he did call the police on one of our reporters info wars reporters who ask him
[09:41.080 --> 09:45.120]  questions at a public speech at the University of Texas Aaron Dykes was arrested charge
[09:45.120 --> 09:51.160]  of trespassing primarily asking a question of his majesty and of course Alex is on his
[09:51.160 --> 09:56.840]  way to the R&C it's going to be an interesting couple of days as as we see what happens of
[09:56.840 --> 10:02.080]  course we've had Roger Stone talk about the fact that he believes that Donald Trump is
[10:02.080 --> 10:08.520]  going to introduce a cabinet pick several cabinet picks at the R&C this coming week
[10:08.520 --> 10:13.080]  and of course you can't promise jobs ahead of election to somebody you get into a legal
[10:13.080 --> 10:18.160]  issue but he said it'd be perfectly legal if he were to say well I'm going to choose
[10:18.160 --> 10:22.200]  for such and such a position somebody I'm going to choose somebody exactly like this
[10:22.200 --> 10:28.040]  particular guy or somebody like him you can do that and give people an idea of what you
[10:28.040 --> 10:32.080]  want to do and of course you should be able to do that without essentially setting up
[10:32.080 --> 10:39.040]  a quid pro quo of being accused of violating the election laws now Alex also has talked
[10:39.040 --> 10:44.040]  about how dangerous this is going to be of course we know there's a lot of presence police
[10:44.040 --> 10:50.200]  presence in the area there's been a lot of assassinations today we've had another event
[10:50.200 --> 10:55.160]  where police officers were ambushed and killed we've had three officers killed in Baton Rouge
[10:55.160 --> 11:01.520]  Louisiana one suspect has been killed two others are in custody as we go to air we've
[11:01.520 --> 11:07.160]  had finally Loretta Lynch Attorney General come out and say something about this Obama
[11:07.160 --> 11:11.840]  is going to be making a speech about it but we also have the Cleveland police union had
[11:11.840 --> 11:16.120]  I want to play that clip pull that clip up and he talks and we have this up on info wars
[11:16.120 --> 11:22.400]  dot com he believes that Obama has blood on his hands because he believes as we do that
[11:22.400 --> 11:29.520]  Obama has been creating this division this narrative that black lives matter and getting
[11:29.520 --> 11:33.760]  angry if you say well white lives also matter blue lives also matter as a matter of fact
[11:33.760 --> 11:40.440]  all lives matter he doesn't want that narrative out he wants to create a victim mentality
[11:40.440 --> 11:45.640]  and us versus them mentality by singling out one group and putting it against the others
[11:45.640 --> 11:50.640]  and they've been very effective at doing that on both ends getting black people angry at
[11:50.640 --> 11:56.720]  what's happening when the police are following the training and using the weapons that the
[11:56.720 --> 12:01.040]  federal government gives them to militarize the police to act more like we have a police
[12:01.040 --> 12:05.320]  state rather than a situation where we're going to have a due process for people are
[12:05.320 --> 12:11.760]  arrested and questioned and charged now they want to have a kind of judge dread going on
[12:11.760 --> 12:17.160]  on the streets and they want this kind of pushback is by design they're escalating both sides
[12:17.160 --> 12:21.000]  and we see this happening everywhere we've seen this happening in other countries that's
[12:21.000 --> 12:23.520]  what we're going to talk about later in the broadcast we're going to talk about what's
[12:23.520 --> 12:27.840]  going on in turkey everybody's pointing fingers at everybody else everybody believes the united
[12:27.840 --> 12:35.760]  states and the CIA were behind this coup against Erdogan working with gulen these are many
[12:35.760 --> 12:41.680]  people have made that point whereas the gulen and Syria are saying no we think that it was
[12:41.680 --> 12:45.960]  a false flag done by Erdogan look the United States government has been involved on both
[12:45.960 --> 12:52.640]  sides of most conflicts and most wars in my lifetime and that's what they're doing here
[12:52.640 --> 12:57.000]  in the United States they're involved with the brutality that you see coming from the
[12:57.000 --> 13:02.320]  police they're involved with the assassinations that you see coming from black lives matter
[13:02.320 --> 13:07.160]  fermenting this even if they aren't directly running it they create the environment that
[13:07.160 --> 13:12.600]  creates the conflict and then they escalated and that's what the police union head in the
[13:12.600 --> 13:20.480]  cleveland pointed out in this clip let's play that clip this all began with a 911 compliment
[13:20.480 --> 13:25.520]  african-american mail saying that another african-american mail was pointing a gun
[13:25.520 --> 13:33.360]  at him those officers responded that mail didn't comply and tragically ended up losing his
[13:33.360 --> 13:39.320]  life life over that with a gun in his pocket this is how this began the president of the
[13:39.320 --> 13:45.480]  United States validated false narrative in the nonsense that black lives matter and the
[13:45.480 --> 13:51.320]  media are pressing out there to the public validated with his very divisive statements
[13:51.320 --> 13:57.680]  and now we see an escalation this has got to and we need some leadership in this country
[13:57.680 --> 14:03.480]  to come forward and put an end to this I don't care if it's clergy I don't care who it is
[14:03.480 --> 14:08.280]  but somebody's got to step up and put an end to this because it's the false narrative and
[14:08.280 --> 14:16.400]  very influential people that are that are politicizing the false narrative absolutely insane
[14:16.400 --> 14:20.480]  that we have a president united states and a governor of minnesota making a statement
[14:20.480 --> 14:25.880]  that they made less than one day after those police involved shootings and those police
[14:25.880 --> 14:31.720]  involved shootings make no mistake are what absolutely has triggered this this rash of
[14:31.720 --> 14:40.040]  of senseless murders of law enforcement officers across this country it is reprehensible and
[14:40.040 --> 14:44.080]  the president united states has bled on his hands and will not be able to come washed
[14:44.080 --> 14:49.880]  off the person you just heard is the police union head and Cleveland and of course that's
[14:49.880 --> 14:54.200]  where the RNC is going to be held beginning tomorrow as I mentioned our crew Alex Jones
[14:54.200 --> 15:01.280]  and our crew are on their way to the RNC we have taken out ads and we're running airplanes

[19:56.080 --> 20:12.960]  today you're listening to the alex jones show from the front lines of the information war
[20:12.960 --> 20:27.280]  it's alex jones welcome back to the alex jones show i'm david night on this sunday july 17th
[20:27.280 --> 20:30.600]  2016 alex jones and most of our crew are on their way to the republican national convention
[20:30.600 --> 20:35.880]  in cleveland and of course there's been a lot of talk about violence there cleveland
[20:35.880 --> 20:41.640]  activists say they're wary of cities plans to process thousands of arrests again of course
[20:41.640 --> 20:46.920]  when they report it from that standpoint roider roiders it looks as though they're they're
[20:46.920 --> 20:51.920]  getting aggressive and they were aggressive i mean they they're trying to confine protesters
[20:51.920 --> 20:57.640]  from both sides in a very small area to make sure there will be a fight that's what they
[20:57.640 --> 21:01.160]  were planning on doing they were successful in coming in and getting that area expanded
[21:01.160 --> 21:06.000]  but of course when you go to presidential nominating conventions the first amendment
[21:06.000 --> 21:12.760]  is confined to an area just like they did out of the bundy ranch put a little squared
[21:12.760 --> 21:18.040]  off area and said this is your first amendment area and somebody wrote a handwritten sign
[21:18.040 --> 21:24.800]  said the first amendment is not an area so the first amendment is being squashed in cleveland
[21:24.800 --> 21:28.480]  in the sense that they won't allow people to walk around freely but of course there is
[21:28.480 --> 21:32.880]  a serious threat of violence from the same people who have been attacking police and
[21:32.880 --> 21:38.200]  other people just as we had the individual who killed all those police officers in dallas
[21:38.200 --> 21:44.800]  say he wants to kill white people and police officers it's just unfocused hatred that is
[21:44.800 --> 21:50.760]  caused by the promotion of the black lives and black lives matter only movement we should
[21:50.760 --> 21:54.720]  call it black lives only matter that's really what we ought to call it so the people understand
[21:54.720 --> 21:59.600]  that we're not saying black lives don't matter but they're saying that other lives don't matter
[21:59.600 --> 22:04.880]  they're saying black lives only matter so there are death threats and alex is going
[22:04.880 --> 22:10.920]  to speak to that he has spoken to that you need to be concerned about what's going to
[22:10.920 --> 22:16.120]  happen at this convention and as I just pointed out in the wake of this most recent shooting
[22:16.120 --> 22:22.240]  today in baton rouge louisiana we had three officers killed of course that was the site
[22:22.240 --> 22:31.080]  of one of the people that was killed and live streamed on social media that individual however
[22:31.080 --> 22:38.120]  unlike the other one who had not done anything he'd been pulled over and was shot and that
[22:38.120 --> 22:44.880]  was live streamed as he died that individual had not done anything but in baton rouge there
[22:44.880 --> 22:48.520]  was a question as to what had happened they had been told that there was an individual
[22:48.520 --> 22:53.280]  with a gun as you heard that clip that we ran from the police chief in cleveland where
[22:53.280 --> 22:58.800]  the rnc is going to be taking place he said we were told there was an individual threatening
[22:58.800 --> 23:04.320]  others with a gun and so they were in heightened alert it was not a clear cut case there are
[23:04.320 --> 23:10.360]  many clear cut cases of excessive use of force by the police but they always seize on the
[23:10.360 --> 23:16.160]  ones that have a gray area aspect to it like this one did and now they have shot and killed
[23:16.160 --> 23:20.000]  three officers many others have been wounded they've killed one suspect two other people
[23:20.000 --> 23:26.080]  are in custody the police chief in cleveland has said that obama has blood on his hands
[23:26.080 --> 23:31.200]  that he will not be able to wash off let's go to this report from alex jones he talked
[23:31.200 --> 23:35.760]  about the fact that even though there are death threats against many different groups
[23:35.760 --> 23:40.920]  there including the police it's not going to stop us from going there to report at either
[23:40.920 --> 23:49.240]  of these conventions it's saturday july 16 2016 and i've had friends i've had family
[23:49.240 --> 23:56.480]  i've had former navy seals other people ask me why are you going to cleveland when it's
[23:56.480 --> 24:01.720]  so incredibly dangerous when it's an admitted terrorist target when you're doing so much
[24:01.720 --> 24:06.520]  good in the info war why are you going and it's because this is a critical year not just
[24:06.520 --> 24:12.360]  here but worldwide it's populism against globalism and there have been so many people trying
[24:12.360 --> 24:16.040]  to intimidate free speech in this country and worldwide and so many on the controlled
[24:16.040 --> 24:20.480]  left that have been trying to ban free speech and they've gotten a democratic party platform
[24:20.480 --> 24:26.280]  coming up in philadelphia in two weeks they have a plan to arrest people that deny man-made
[24:26.280 --> 24:31.600]  climate change that's people that don't want to pay the globalist carbon texas that i have
[24:31.600 --> 24:36.600]  to go out and exercise free speech when it's dangerous when it's all maligned just at a
[24:36.600 --> 24:40.680]  metaphysical level putting my skin in the game that's what i've always done and it's
[24:40.680 --> 24:44.720]  not because i have something to prove it's that i understand that sometimes you've got
[24:44.720 --> 24:50.720]  to walk along the ridge sometimes you've got to be skyline that's a military term where
[24:50.720 --> 24:54.240]  you don't want to walk on the top of a hill where the blue sky is behind your silhouette
[24:54.240 --> 25:00.320]  it's a perfect target unless you're drawing fire and i mean that again at a political
[25:00.320 --> 25:05.680]  level we have to go out and show the tyrants for who they are not just let them tell us
[25:05.680 --> 25:10.800]  how you better not show up and we're going to get you but show them it doesn't matter
[25:10.800 --> 25:15.160]  that the tree of liberty must be watered with the blood of patriots and tyrants to almost
[25:15.160 --> 25:18.880]  jefferson and my god i'm the guy that takes care of my family i'm the guy that takes care
[25:18.880 --> 25:23.760]  of my kids i mean i'm the guy that runs info wars i've got a lot of responsibilities and
[25:23.760 --> 25:33.620]  i i i know they're important but again at a spiritual level it is important to not run
[25:33.620 --> 25:39.680]  from the enemy but to confront the enemy peacefully with information because ideas are bulletproof
[25:39.680 --> 25:43.680]  and in god's plan i know it's the right thing to go to cleveland to have our crew go to
[25:43.680 --> 25:48.520]  philadelphia bill de berg and other places like bohemian grove we snuck into and you
[25:48.520 --> 25:52.960]  know going out and protesting the kkk and la rosa and mecha and other races haygrips
[25:52.960 --> 25:59.560]  it's what we do and compared to what soldiers have done in the past it's really nothing
[25:59.560 --> 26:05.240]  but let's expand on that if you look at lexington and concord where the british were coming
[26:05.240 --> 26:13.200]  and confiscating civilian and the level government's guns 1775 it's what started 1776 is what
[26:13.200 --> 26:20.040]  july 4th is they had their guys ready they're in front of the armory they're on the hill
[26:20.040 --> 26:26.240]  and they said don't fire first and but if they want a war they're gonna get one well
[26:26.240 --> 26:30.920]  i'm going on arm myself i'm going on with information the truth but the point is is
[26:30.920 --> 26:35.600]  that that was up there on the hill waiting for the british a force of four or five times
[26:35.600 --> 26:40.960]  bigger and with better weapons to to to show up and try to take their guns and they said
[26:40.960 --> 26:44.200]  look we're not turning them in well i'm not turning my free speech in so i'll be there
[26:44.200 --> 26:48.920]  on the hill that's how this works and if the globalists in george soros people like that
[26:48.920 --> 26:52.760]  want to fire the shot around the world that's their issue and if they want to you know try
[26:52.760 --> 26:56.480]  to hire some you know mentally ill twisted right winger or something to pull something
[26:56.480 --> 27:02.600]  i see that in the delays that's the way it is we have to forget the maneuvers at certain
[27:02.600 --> 27:08.720]  points and go straight down we've gotten in this position because we always try to think
[27:08.720 --> 27:13.040]  things out too far and and look at every angle instead of just doing what's right and saying
[27:13.040 --> 27:21.880]  hey justice be done may the heavens fall i'm done playing games and i'm not trying to escape
[27:21.880 --> 27:27.200]  the new world order i'm trying to seek it out and expose it and defeat it and to do that
[27:27.200 --> 27:32.480]  i have to meet it on the intellectual plane of battle we're winning the intellectual plane
[27:32.480 --> 27:37.920]  breaks it congress has a nine percent approval rating the media ap poll six percent trust
[27:37.920 --> 27:46.040]  the enemy is dying the globalist lie is collapsing the dinosaur media is already over and now
[27:46.040 --> 27:51.320]  it's time to boldly stand up and say we're not backing down we're never given in and
[27:51.320 --> 27:54.720]  they may steal this election they may engage in other frauds just like they know build
[27:54.720 --> 27:59.520]  hillary just like they said oh we're not going to charge her that made her even more unpopular
[27:59.520 --> 28:02.880]  resistance is victory but if we don't speak out if we don't take action if we don't call
[28:02.880 --> 28:07.240]  for her to be arrested or indicted then it would never even get to the point of them
[28:07.240 --> 28:11.640]  saying we're not going to indict her she's above the law that's why resistance is victory
[28:11.640 --> 28:17.440]  whether we win today or we win next year or five years from now it's that animating contest
[28:17.440 --> 28:21.480]  of liberty and it's the exactly and that you can see the rest of that report at info wars
[28:21.480 --> 28:26.200]  dot com and at our youtube channel of course as alex is going there they're talking about
[28:26.200 --> 28:30.200]  how cleveland's new park is going to find resistance wired magazine points out there's
[28:30.200 --> 28:36.320]  going to be tens of thousands of people combined into a three square mile area of the city
[28:36.320 --> 28:39.760]  all these people who are adamantly opposed to each other and they say well they're going
[28:39.760 --> 28:44.840]  to outlaw tennis balls flashlights and water guns but under ohio laws you'll be able to
[28:44.840 --> 28:50.240]  carry real guns well you know you can't defend yourself with a tennis ball a flashlight or
[28:50.240 --> 28:53.800]  a squirt gun it's going to be dangerous but it's very important that we be there stay
[28:53.800 --> 29:00.120]  with us we'll be right back let's just media outlets reacted to the devastating attack
[29:00.120 --> 29:05.440]  in the east not by blaming islam or even terrorists but by suggesting that an inanimate object
[29:05.440 --> 29:10.040]  the truck was responsible for the carnage instead of pointing our fingers at islamis
[29:10.040 --> 29:14.600]  cnn cbc in the new york times all published headlines the serve to hide the true nature
[29:14.600 --> 29:19.440]  of the attack cbc reported children feared killed in the east as truck attacks family
[29:19.440 --> 29:24.360]  events presumably the truck was somehow able to manifest artificial intelligence and plow
[29:24.360 --> 29:30.440]  itself through dozens of victims way to go mainstream media ding ding ding not to be
[29:30.440 --> 29:35.520]  all done cnn reported truck rams crowd 84 dead in east again providing a convenient
[29:35.520 --> 29:42.240]  way to avoid any mention of the ideology that inspired the driver did it rhyme with aloha
[29:42.240 --> 29:47.800]  snack bar the new york times went with truck attack on french crowd scores died again painting
[29:47.800 --> 29:52.600]  the blame on the vehicle rather than the islamist inside it you can find more reports like this

[34:44.720 --> 34:49.120]  and many other things and of course reservatrol is one of those things that has been also
[34:49.120 --> 34:55.600]  linked and studied in many different aspects in terms of helping you life extension and
[34:55.600 --> 34:59.240]  that sort of thing so take a look at and do your own research we can't connect the dots
[34:59.240 --> 35:03.240]  for you but we can direct you to the studies that you can find for yourself on the internet

[35:59.920 --> 36:06.000]  we're doing right there hillary for prison 2016 some great shots of that okay before
[36:06.000 --> 36:09.080]  we leave the rnc i just want to give you a quick update of some of the things that are
[36:09.080 --> 36:12.640]  happening there there was an interesting article from the hill talking about winners and losers
[36:12.640 --> 36:17.080]  and of course it was at the very end of last week thursday and friday they were talking
[36:17.080 --> 36:22.040]  about what was happening as the delegates were going to be coming and the convention
[36:22.040 --> 36:25.520]  is going to start tomorrow but there's a lot that's already been happening there of course
[36:25.520 --> 36:31.400]  with the platform and the rules committee meetings this is where the never trump people
[36:31.400 --> 36:37.320]  were going to try to change the rules and essentially alter the results of the election
[36:37.320 --> 36:42.760]  saying that their opinions mattered more than the opinions of the voters i could never get
[36:42.760 --> 36:47.520]  anybody from the free free the delegates movements to come on and and talk to me to be interviewed
[36:47.520 --> 36:54.360]  because it is just quite frankly well understand what it is it's a super delegate elitist fraud
[36:54.360 --> 36:58.200]  committed on the voters they go in these areas and tell everybody hey we're going to have
[36:58.200 --> 37:03.440]  an election you're going to get to pick this everybody goes does the election they have
[37:03.440 --> 37:07.640]  the elections paid for by the state and then they said no no no no we don't like the results
[37:07.640 --> 37:12.680]  and and we have a private party you know so the public when they want to be in their private
[37:12.680 --> 37:18.080]  when they want to be you know just like crony capitalism if the banks or the light rail
[37:18.080 --> 37:21.440]  systems that are coming through like we have here in texas these crony capitalists when
[37:21.440 --> 37:25.720]  they come through they get all this money from the government saying you know it's in everybody's
[37:25.720 --> 37:31.960]  best interest for us to do this so we need your your financing we need you to steal property
[37:31.960 --> 37:36.520]  using imminent domain and turn it over to us but then if they lose money guess who gets
[37:36.520 --> 37:43.040]  stuck with the bill they privatize their profits they make public their losses they socialize
[37:43.040 --> 37:48.320]  their losses and so that's what we see it's just it's not only sour grapes but it was
[37:48.320 --> 37:52.240]  an effort to say well no now we're private now we're public now we're private again now
[37:52.240 --> 37:56.120]  we're public again that all got shut down interestingly enough I'm sure it had a lot
[37:56.120 --> 38:01.200]  to do with the fact that Donald Trump picked Pence who was essentially throwing a bone
[38:01.200 --> 38:06.400]  to the GOP establishment but they're saying that Trump's positions on immigration and
[38:06.400 --> 38:12.040]  trade have now been officially put into the platform committee and you know the platform
[38:12.040 --> 38:17.080]  doesn't really make that much difference it's really the candidate is going to create his
[38:17.080 --> 38:21.400]  own platform and he's not going to be governed by the platform it has absolutely no effect
[38:21.400 --> 38:25.760]  on the candidate once they take office but it was interesting when they talked about
[38:25.760 --> 38:31.200]  how they beat back the never Trump people they said that former Virginia Attorney General
[38:31.200 --> 38:36.440]  Ken Cuccinelli who was on the rules committee was and also Ted Cruz ally was going to introduce
[38:36.440 --> 38:42.480]  a lot of proposals that were going to alter that were going to strip the RNC of its power
[38:42.480 --> 38:47.040]  over the nominating process as they were starting to do this the woman who was chairing this
[38:47.040 --> 38:52.520]  declared an emergency recess and said the printer needed to be fixed that was just a
[38:52.520 --> 38:56.480]  ruse as they point out in the hill say the break was so that previous and other top RNC
[38:56.480 --> 39:02.920]  officials could convene a private meeting to talk to Cuccinelli and tell him not to do
[39:02.920 --> 39:07.640]  this not to embarrass them not to bring this up and of course then they didn't interestingly
[39:07.640 --> 39:12.840]  enough they say that what he was really trying to do when the key things that Cuccinelli
[39:12.840 --> 39:18.800]  and others are trying to do was to make sure that future elections would not include independence
[39:18.800 --> 39:22.640]  or Democrats in other words not a lot bar independence and Democrats from voting in
[39:22.640 --> 39:31.560]  all RNC primaries well you know what I think you probably want somebody who can get independence
[39:31.560 --> 39:34.800]  that's the way you win elections you don't win election you can win a nomination easily
[39:34.800 --> 39:42.720]  enough like Ted Cruz if only the die hard Republicans are allowed to vote but you really
[39:42.720 --> 39:46.720]  want to get some you really want to find out if you're going to get a candidate who's
[39:46.720 --> 39:51.320]  going to win and of course they keep saying that well you know we we want Ted Cruz because
[39:51.320 --> 39:55.360]  we don't think that Donald Trump can win well Donald Trump beat him largely because he
[39:55.360 --> 39:58.480]  gets so many independent supporting him more independent support him than support Hillary
[39:58.480 --> 40:03.760]  Clinton they want to make sure that doesn't happen again and then they tried to say well
[40:03.760 --> 40:08.680]  we want to take control of the votes with the never Trump movement now the people who
[40:08.680 --> 40:11.680]  were going to change the rules they call it the free the delegates saying that they're
[40:11.680 --> 40:17.000]  not going to be bound by the public election they were going to just do whatever they wished
[40:17.000 --> 40:23.440]  and they couched it in terms of obeying their conscience and in terms of them having first
[40:23.440 --> 40:28.680]  amendment rights what a bunch of nonsense now they point out in this article from the
[40:28.680 --> 40:35.560]  Hill that attracted very little support with only about a dozen of 112 member panel far
[40:35.560 --> 40:40.200]  below the threshold even already low of only 28 signatures on the proposal so that it would
[40:40.200 --> 40:44.680]  come to the floor for a vote so they didn't even come close to what they needed to bring
[40:44.680 --> 40:49.680]  this release the delegates free the delegates up for a vote so it looks like that part of
[40:49.680 --> 40:55.560]  it is is not going to happen meanwhile Bob Dole is very disappointed that Jeb Bush is
[40:55.560 --> 40:59.000]  going to skip the convention and I think that Bob Dole is probably the only one who would
[40:59.000 --> 41:05.080]  notice that Jeb Bush is missing from the convention but he does call out Jeb Bush on the fact
[41:05.080 --> 41:09.560]  that hey he took a pledge and he said he would support the eventual nominee and he's not
[41:09.560 --> 41:17.040]  doing it yeah he would have betrayed us on all of the issues just as he's betrayed himself
[41:17.040 --> 41:23.360]  on that pledge meanwhile they are moving to talk about the fact that what we need to do
[41:23.360 --> 41:28.680]  with immigration is control immigration from specific countries in other words it's not
[41:28.680 --> 41:32.160]  going to be a religious test but it's going to be a geographical test you know these are
[41:32.160 --> 41:37.120]  people that we've gone into their country we've created a civil war and then we want
[41:37.120 --> 41:42.160]  to bring that civil war to America that's the policy of Obama quite frankly and that's
[41:42.160 --> 41:47.360]  what we see happening over and over again that's what I want to focus on for the rest
[41:47.360 --> 41:52.280]  of the broadcast we're going to talk about what's going on in Turkey the Turkish coup
[41:52.280 --> 41:56.520]  we also have joining us in the second hour we have Mark Hall who is a filmmaker if you
[41:56.520 --> 42:04.120]  remember the documentary film Vaxt about the connection between autism and vaccines and
[42:04.120 --> 42:10.440]  that was shut down from the Tribeca film festival and Robert De Niro who is the public face
[42:10.440 --> 42:14.960]  of the film festival is not very happy with that and he said you know I think we ought
[42:14.960 --> 42:21.440]  to have an open discussion of these ideas that's what film should be about and I think
[42:21.440 --> 42:27.520]  he truly regretted allowing the administrator and interestingly enough other filmmakers
[42:27.520 --> 42:33.640]  censor that but what we have seen with this film that Mark Hall put together looking at
[42:33.640 --> 42:39.040]  the influence of a Turkish mom that is at the center of this Turkish coup that was shut
[42:39.040 --> 42:45.360]  down by Texas film festivals South by Southwest the Lone Star film festival the Dallas International
[42:45.360 --> 42:50.240]  Film Festival they all shut it down we're going to talk to him about what he knows about
[42:50.240 --> 42:54.320]  this coup that is coming to our educational system here in the United States so let's

[46:54.920 --> 47:04.440]  for all your work sir on this great product you're listening to the alex jones show
[47:04.440 --> 47:21.240]  we are on the march the empire is on the run alex jones and the GCN radio network
[47:26.200 --> 47:30.600]  welcome back to the alex jones show I'm david night on this sunday july 17th 2016
[47:30.600 --> 47:37.400]  the next hour we're going to be talking to mark hall a film documentarian is a film killing ed
[47:38.120 --> 47:43.560]  looked at charter schools and of course the issue with charter schools one of the key issues of that
[47:43.560 --> 47:49.480]  it is these are schools that are publicly funded with taxpayer money but they're run privately
[47:49.480 --> 47:55.000]  so one of the problems that develops from that is one of crony capitalism that's something we need
[47:55.000 --> 47:59.000]  to guard against but one of the worst-case examples that he found of that is what the
[47:59.000 --> 48:05.480]  documentary really kind of centers on is a group of schools that are run by an islamic movement
[48:05.480 --> 48:09.960]  the same guy who is an exile in the united states the same guy that is being accused
[48:09.960 --> 48:15.080]  by the turkish government of being behind the coup or at least his supporters and of course
[48:15.080 --> 48:21.000]  he is one of the two individuals in turkey that is uh they're really the power bases there's uh gulan
[48:21.000 --> 48:29.160]  and urtigan both of them islamists okay there's not secularists okay and both of them with ties to
[48:29.160 --> 48:34.760]  nato and to the cia so the water is pretty murky here there's not always a good guy
[48:34.760 --> 48:39.240]  in these fights you need to understand that but we're going to talk to mark hall he knows the
[48:40.280 --> 48:44.840]  the setting here he's studied this quite a bit of course his film has been censored
[48:44.840 --> 48:49.160]  just like we saw vaxed censored talking about the connection between vaxism
[48:49.160 --> 48:57.160]  vaccines and autism this film because it talks about islam and essentially a turkish coup
[48:57.160 --> 49:02.120]  against the us educational system because it talks about that it has been shut down the
[49:02.120 --> 49:06.520]  new york times would not review it texas film festivals would not show it it has been shown
[49:06.520 --> 49:11.240]  in some film festivals i've seen it myself it's an excellent film you can get it uh it's now on
[49:11.240 --> 49:16.680]  dvd but we're going to talk to him in the next hour before we go to that there's some updates
[49:16.680 --> 49:22.040]  on what happened in nise and of course as we pointed out last week everybody we had all
[49:22.040 --> 49:27.480]  these reports from mainstream media blaming the attack on the truck it can't be the fault of
[49:27.480 --> 49:36.520]  radical islam no it was it was actually isis a guy who said that his family has shown that just
[49:36.520 --> 49:42.840]  minutes before the attack he texted to somebody bring more weapons it's good i have the equipment
[49:42.840 --> 49:50.760]  that he has also sent a great deal of money i believe it was something like 84 000 pounds
[49:50.760 --> 49:57.080]  or something to uh in in british pounds to his family in tunisia you have to ask yourself
[49:57.080 --> 50:04.680]  was this guy really put upon here was he really exploited by the europeans as we see peter bergen
[50:04.680 --> 50:10.840]  the expert so-called expert on terrorism on cnn say we've got a clip from peter bergen i want
[50:10.840 --> 50:18.440]  to play this for you because he says that actually it is a european fascism that triggered this guy
[50:18.440 --> 50:25.320]  that turned him into this monster mowing down little children with a vague 18 wheeler i mean
[50:25.320 --> 50:32.440]  that is such an insult to our intelligence and how did this guy get so much money working as a
[50:32.440 --> 50:38.120]  at a low-level manual labor jobs okay that he could send in just a few years of being there
[50:38.120 --> 50:44.200]  send the equivalent of 120 or 30 000 back to family in tunisia yeah right okay let's play
[50:44.200 --> 50:50.200]  this clip from peter bergen well i think it is you know i it is a major problem in europe and i
[50:50.200 --> 50:55.160]  mean the we have you know isis is going to be destroyed contained or choose your verb in the
[50:55.160 --> 51:00.600]  next year or so where they're going to be really on you know in a very very bad place they may lose
[51:00.600 --> 51:05.800]  mozal but the big drivers of this are a regional civil war between the sunni and the shia the
[51:05.800 --> 51:10.440]  collapse of arab governance around the middle east you know the vast ways of immigration that
[51:10.440 --> 51:15.480]  result of these two phenomenon and then the rise of european fashion fascism to be frank i mean
[51:15.480 --> 51:21.960]  in every single country including france where the nationalist front the essentially ultra nationalist
[51:21.960 --> 51:26.520]  proto fascist party is doing pretty well and i think the combination of large-scale immigration
[51:26.520 --> 51:31.800]  and the rise of european fascism is a very toxic mix and unfortunately it will continue to produce
[51:31.800 --> 51:36.440]  events like what we what we've seen uh tonight again and again and again and there's no easy
[51:36.440 --> 51:41.480]  fixes okay let's just cut this guy off because i can't stand hearing this guy continually talking
[51:41.480 --> 51:46.440]  about the rise of european fascism as if that was the trigger for this that's absolute nonsense he
[51:46.440 --> 51:50.440]  started almost say when you heard him he almost started to say european fashion yeah that's the
[51:50.440 --> 51:57.000]  fashion that's being foisted upon people by angela merkel uh by hollanda who spends three times the
[51:57.000 --> 52:03.240]  uh wages an average frenchman makes on just doing his hair okay that's the arrogance of these people
[52:03.960 --> 52:09.960]  there wasn't anybody taunting or harming this guy he had been he'd given nothing but helping hand
[52:09.960 --> 52:15.720]  by these people and yet he responded by running them down out of hate out of that hateful religion
[52:15.720 --> 52:22.440]  that he was following this is world war three this is what they're trying to do in this country
[52:22.440 --> 52:26.760]  they're deliberately trying when they talk about european fascism they're just simply talking about
[52:26.760 --> 52:31.320]  the fact that people are angry that muslims that are coming to this country that are being brought
[52:31.320 --> 52:35.800]  here by the government in massive numbers that will not assemble you know when it's the difference
[52:35.800 --> 52:40.440]  between helping somebody and having an invasion is the numbers of people that you bring in and the
[52:40.440 --> 52:44.280]  character of the people that you're bringing them in and where you're bringing them from
[52:44.280 --> 52:49.560]  they've gone to these countries they have created wars created civil wars then they bring these people
[52:49.560 --> 52:55.320]  here in mass numbers and it is a planned attack this is what alex jones was talking about when he
[52:55.320 --> 53:02.440]  said emergency the planet is close to world war three his here's his report it's saturday july 16th
[53:02.440 --> 53:15.480]  2016 alex jones here with the most dire geopolitical alert that we have ever issued in my 21 years on
[53:15.480 --> 53:23.320]  air interviewing top political scientist pentagon insiders you name it we have never issued an alert
[53:23.320 --> 53:29.080]  this serious now several times over the years we've come out and said this alert is the most
[53:29.080 --> 53:39.880]  serious as the ticking clock goes towards midnight or doomsday armageddon but out of those alerts
[53:40.520 --> 53:50.840]  in the past on this road to global war this is over the top the most dangerous time we have ever
[53:50.840 --> 53:55.320]  been and the pentagon agrees with me now i'm gonna lay out some of these facts right now and put
[53:55.320 --> 54:00.840]  some articles up on screen but this is so serious my one day off before i go to cleveland to cover
[54:00.840 --> 54:07.800]  the r and c my one day to say bye to my kids going on that dangerous mission this republic
[54:07.800 --> 54:14.760]  demands i go on i'm up here working because i understand that we don't avert what's unfolding
[54:16.040 --> 54:19.720]  my children your children don't have a future now let's walk through a few of the things that
[54:19.720 --> 54:25.320]  have happened putin has come out in the last month twice we've done reports on this and said they're
[54:25.320 --> 54:29.080]  preparing for nuclear war and the less is moving weapons up against his border and they may have
[54:29.080 --> 54:33.640]  to strike that the world is incredible danger and he can't believe western media isn't reporting this
[54:33.640 --> 54:39.000]  and beg for a global debate about it a discourse a dialogue the communist chinese who are horribly
[54:39.000 --> 54:43.160]  evil but that our government's armed and given the missiles to be able to hit the united states
[54:43.160 --> 54:49.880]  effectively has a movement of the south china sea and now as we speak for stories on info wars.com
[54:49.880 --> 54:55.880]  from mainstream news but overseas not here that major u.s and chinese fleets are lining up against
[54:55.880 --> 55:00.680]  each other and the communist chinese presidents said they're preparing for all-out war including
[55:00.680 --> 55:06.760]  possible world war three this is coming out of the communist chinese leadership's mouths they've
[55:06.760 --> 55:14.600]  never talked like this even during the korean war unprecedented then you've got the coup that
[55:14.600 --> 55:20.280]  supposedly failed in the last 24 hours in turkey the gateway to europe with all the jihadists flooding
[55:20.280 --> 55:26.440]  in urgun is backed by the jihadists and it looks like they've gotten back control you've got that
[55:26.440 --> 55:31.960]  craziness going on you've got all of these different governments going bankrupt and riots from venezuela
[55:31.960 --> 55:37.080]  to nigeria you've got the pentagon the ministry of defense in england others saying the world is
[55:37.080 --> 55:42.840]  the most dangerous position it's ever been and then you got obama coming out and saying the world's
[55:42.840 --> 55:47.240]  the safest it's ever been and our economy is the best it's ever been we have derivatives all over
[55:47.240 --> 55:52.440]  the world come and do we have deutschbank much bigger than lehmann brothers going down at stock
[55:52.440 --> 55:58.600]  plunging that crisis has already begun hundreds and hundreds and hundreds i just got intense chills
[55:58.600 --> 56:04.200]  hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of different things are coming together to create the perfect
[56:04.200 --> 56:08.440]  storm and then you've got all these historians all these geopolitical scientists all these political
[56:08.440 --> 56:16.360]  scientists all these analysts from russia england the us canada australia germany doesn't matter
[56:16.360 --> 56:22.440]  saying we have all the same political things happening that led to world war one and world
[56:22.440 --> 56:27.320]  war two wars starting all sorts of crises unfolding and historically they don't know why but
[56:27.320 --> 56:31.800]  it's just the time of the romans and the and the chinese and the japanese wrote about this too
[56:31.800 --> 56:36.120]  that it seemed when there was earth changes and volcanoes and earthquakes that was a harbinger
[56:36.120 --> 56:43.160]  of war as well and guess what record levels earthquakes record levels volcanoes ever recorded
[56:43.160 --> 56:51.800]  in modern history for whatever reason a lot of political scientists also tie it to not just the
[56:51.800 --> 56:56.360]  effects of what's happening inside our atmosphere but what's happening in our solar system that
[56:56.360 --> 57:01.400]  correlated sunspots and things like that uh to economic collapse as well we're entering that same
[57:01.400 --> 57:08.920]  cycle that's that's mr dent of of of a bane capital best-selling author top guy predicting things
[57:08.920 --> 57:13.400]  he's got charts to bring all that in and top corporations listen to him i mean there's just
[57:13.400 --> 57:19.080]  so much aligning okay that's alex jones's report emergency planet close to world war three we're
[57:19.080 --> 57:24.280]  gonna have a special report on the other side from john bound about how this is coming up

[58:57.240 --> 59:03.320]  that iodine deficiencies can devastate iq and how the government knowingly started taking iodine out
[59:03.320 --> 59:08.360]  of the food and adding fluoride the bad member of the halogen family into the water they took the
[59:08.360 --> 59:13.720]  good halogen out and put the deadly halogen in and when the Fukushima crisis worsened as it

[59:53.080 --> 1:00:08.520]  jones show from the front lines of the information war it's alex jones watch me watch me globalist
[1:00:08.520 --> 1:00:15.960]  driving us all headlong into a hell pit have to say we are most certainly at war shocking rhetoric
[1:00:15.960 --> 1:00:21.480]  if it's a world war then you have to mobilize nato you have to get all the nato countries to
[1:00:21.480 --> 1:00:28.040]  say we are going to commit forces both ground and air to wipe ices off the face of the earth
[1:00:28.040 --> 1:00:33.880]  we're supporting nato and we should at least get something out of it and getting rid of ices and
[1:00:33.880 --> 1:00:39.480]  getting rid of this cancer that we're watching all over the world that certainly would be a good thing
[1:00:39.480 --> 1:00:47.080]  western civilization is in a war we should frankly test every person from here who's who
[1:00:47.080 --> 1:00:51.880]  is of a muslim background and if they believe in sharia they should be deported and if you are
[1:00:51.880 --> 1:00:58.280]  a believing muslim you believe that no man made law which was what they consider the constitution
[1:00:58.280 --> 1:01:05.640]  no man made law can be above sterile law however globalists like french president françois oland
[1:01:05.640 --> 1:01:12.680]  and us president barack obama would have us all behave as sitting ducks just fodder for the revolving
[1:01:12.680 --> 1:01:19.320]  door of repackaged horror blaming the carnage on lone wolf attacks and controlling the narrative
[1:01:19.320 --> 1:01:25.640]  right down to the very language we are allowed to use as we all face certain doom terrorist
[1:01:25.640 --> 1:01:35.000]  because that's the event now notice over here muslims are not terrorists the holland and the
[1:01:35.000 --> 1:01:42.440]  and merkel their jizya their bride price for continuing in power under the new caliphate
[1:01:43.080 --> 1:01:49.720]  is to betray their own people to lie to their about their own people and to their own right so
[1:01:49.720 --> 1:01:54.360]  they've in fact they've had the meetings where they say you've got to give us cover for our jihad
[1:01:54.360 --> 1:01:58.520]  we want to see you let us do this just like a gang member to be initiated has got to go kill an old
[1:01:58.520 --> 1:02:03.400]  lady for no reason this is literally a gang initiation well this is a gang initiation where
[1:02:03.400 --> 1:02:08.760]  the leaders of europe are lying to their own people and they know they're lying to their own
[1:02:08.760 --> 1:02:15.640]  people this is their bride price their jizya attacks for becoming safe dimmies and keeping their
[1:02:15.640 --> 1:02:22.040]  power now some of them might just out and out say i converted long ago i'm a muslim fooled you
[1:02:22.040 --> 1:02:27.720]  or they might say as long as i keep my palace and my villa in my estate i don't really care
[1:02:27.720 --> 1:02:36.280]  but their bride price their jizya tax is to sell out their own people the narrative has to change
[1:02:36.280 --> 1:02:42.280]  or more innocent people will certainly die anthony frida writes perhaps instead of lying
[1:02:42.280 --> 1:02:47.960]  after every act of jihad and saying that islam is a religion of peace and that terrorists are
[1:02:47.960 --> 1:02:54.040]  perverting islam obama and his cohort should tell the truth and express the fact that these
[1:02:54.040 --> 1:03:01.720]  horrific acts are sanctioned by islamic dogma at least 84 dead in east france after a tunisian
[1:03:01.720 --> 1:03:07.400]  living in france rented a 19 ton refrigerated truck that he used to kill at least 84 people
[1:03:07.400 --> 1:03:13.400]  and critically injure 50 more 10 of those killed were children all of this on bastille day the
[1:03:13.400 --> 1:03:19.560]  french independence holiday the irony in this attack is probably lost on most people because
[1:03:19.560 --> 1:03:25.400]  most people can't see from the jihadist perspective the attack in these was an expression of the
[1:03:25.400 --> 1:03:34.440]  coming caliphate's own independence bad ideology beats no ideology even an evil bad cult beats
[1:03:34.440 --> 1:03:40.760]  secular nothingness and nihilism right uh you know the postmodern nihilistic uh
[1:03:40.760 --> 1:03:46.840]  uh all things are the same there's no there's no good there's no bad that means islam wins
[1:03:46.840 --> 1:03:51.000]  because don't we need a new crusade i mean the crusade's got a dirty name but we were attacked
[1:03:51.000 --> 1:03:56.040]  for 400 years before we went in there and kicked their ass and i'm sorry if they want one and at
[1:03:56.040 --> 1:04:00.360]  this time we want to attack countries that are that are moderate saudi arabia and all these
[1:04:00.360 --> 1:04:05.640]  other jihad centers they want to fight they need to really get one well the the good thing is that
[1:04:05.640 --> 1:04:12.520]  we have this constitution so we have at least a legal uh a trench line to fight in which is that
[1:04:12.520 --> 1:04:20.200]  our constitution is above sharia law and anybody who says for example hillary clinton she wants to
[1:04:20.200 --> 1:04:24.920]  to pass right and that's john bound special report wake up we are already in a war and we're going
[1:04:24.920 --> 1:04:30.520]  to talk to marco documentary filmmaker he's going to be talking to us that's so much what we're
[1:04:30.520 --> 1:04:34.840]  going to talk about the turkish coup but you have to understand there is an islamic coup that is
[1:04:34.840 --> 1:04:39.560]  underway against our own educational system here in the united states and in many countries
[1:04:39.560 --> 1:04:45.240]  all over the world we come back we'll talk to him about his film killing ed and about the gulen
[1:04:45.240 --> 1:05:00.760]  movement stay with us we'll be right back leftist media outlets reacted to the devastating
[1:05:00.760 --> 1:05:05.960]  attack in nise not by blaming islam or even terrorists but by suggesting that an inanimate
[1:05:05.960 --> 1:05:11.800]  object the truck was responsible for the carnage instead of pointing our fingers at islamis cnn cbc
[1:05:11.800 --> 1:05:16.360]  in the new york times all published headlines that served to hide the true nature of the attack
[1:05:16.360 --> 1:05:21.960]  cbc reported children feared killed in nise his truck attacks family events presumably the truck
[1:05:21.960 --> 1:05:28.040]  was somehow able to manifest artificial intelligence and plough itself through dozens of victims
[1:05:28.040 --> 1:05:34.280]  way to go mainstream media ding ding ding not to be all done cnn reported truck rams crowd 84
[1:05:34.280 --> 1:05:40.760]  dead in east again providing a convenient way to avoid any mention of the ideology that inspired
[1:05:40.760 --> 1:05:46.520]  the driver did it rhyme with aloha snack bar the new york times went with truck attack on french
[1:05:46.520 --> 1:05:51.960]  crowd scores died again painting the blame on the vehicle rather than the islamists inside it
[1:05:51.960 --> 1:06:08.040]  you can find more reports like this at info wars dot com hello ha snack bar

[1:06:38.840 --> 1:06:43.400]  as well as our youtube channel rob do was flying in the plane reporting on that's an interesting
[1:06:43.400 --> 1:06:48.920]  video uh of course they're going to be reporting this week doing live reports live broadcast from
[1:06:48.920 --> 1:06:55.480]  the republican national convention in cleveland uh the next week we will be in the uh in philadelphia
[1:06:55.480 --> 1:06:59.640]  for the democrat national convention i want to give you a quick update on this shooting of the
[1:06:59.640 --> 1:07:04.600]  police officers in baton rouge right now there's three officers killed three wounded they have
[1:07:04.600 --> 1:07:10.120]  identified the shooter that they uh say they killed uh that he's been identified the suspect
[1:07:10.120 --> 1:07:16.120]  has been identified as a black male named gavin eugene long of kansas city missouri so he came from
[1:07:16.120 --> 1:07:22.600]  missouri to go to baton rouge and shoot the police there uh he is a veteran he left the marines in
[1:07:22.600 --> 1:07:28.040]  2010 with an honorable discharge with the rank of sergeant uh that's all we're being told right now
[1:07:28.040 --> 1:07:33.880]  by uh sources official sources i want to talk about what's going on with the turkish coup and of
[1:07:33.880 --> 1:07:40.680]  course as we last had a news broadcast on friday uh it was just starting to develop sources were
[1:07:40.680 --> 1:07:46.680]  reporting that it was going to be something that was going to last quite uh possibly be a civil war
[1:07:46.680 --> 1:07:52.760]  as we pointed out in the friday broadcast the nightly news this all began to occur suspiciously
[1:07:53.800 --> 1:08:00.360]  immediately after an extradition uh notice was given to us government to try to extradite a turkish
[1:08:00.360 --> 1:08:06.520]  imam fatala gulen who is now residing in america in pennsylvania and they put together a large
[1:08:06.520 --> 1:08:12.040]  indictment for a very long time there's been a competition between fatala gulen supporters
[1:08:12.040 --> 1:08:17.640]  and president erdogan who is in charge of the government in turkey and there has been a back
[1:08:17.640 --> 1:08:22.920]  and forth they've had people arrested by the gulenists who were innocent and eventually freed
[1:08:22.920 --> 1:08:28.120]  because he has a lot of people in the judiciary as well as the police the military the bureaucracy
[1:08:28.120 --> 1:08:33.240]  the educational establishment so there's a essentially a divided government is divided
[1:08:33.240 --> 1:08:39.160]  between two people who are basically islamicists there's not really uh neither of these guys
[1:08:39.160 --> 1:08:43.960]  are about a secular government as we would understand it here in this country both of
[1:08:43.960 --> 1:08:49.800]  them have pushed very hard for islamification of turkey and if you remember back in november
[1:08:49.800 --> 1:08:57.960]  when this uh russian jet was shut down uh flying over syria invited there by the syrian government
[1:08:57.960 --> 1:09:03.240]  to try to fight isis and of course the turkish government said that they had flown over or
[1:09:03.240 --> 1:09:07.800]  too close to the border and they shot down that jet and at the time vladimir putin said well the
[1:09:07.800 --> 1:09:12.520]  problem is not the tragedy that we witnessed yesterday he said the problem is much deeper
[1:09:13.080 --> 1:09:18.280]  we see the current turkish leadership over a significant number of years has been pushing a
[1:09:18.280 --> 1:09:24.520]  deliberate policy of supporting the islamization of their country but of course if you look at
[1:09:24.520 --> 1:09:29.400]  what's going on with fatala gulen the fact that he runs about a thousand schools worldwide
[1:09:29.400 --> 1:09:35.720]  outside the united states they're all very explicitly and overtly madrasas in the united
[1:09:35.720 --> 1:09:40.120]  states they don't run them that way because they want your money your taxpayer money you know most
[1:09:40.120 --> 1:09:45.480]  of the money that you spend on taxes uh is coming in terms of property taxes that's one of our
[1:09:45.480 --> 1:09:51.240]  concerns as we look at uncontrolled immigration and the dreamers how do we afford to give everybody
[1:09:51.240 --> 1:09:56.440]  who wants to come to america a free education all the way up through college and graduate school
[1:09:56.440 --> 1:10:01.240]  in the language of their choice well the other flip side of that is that we have these things
[1:10:01.240 --> 1:10:08.360]  called charter schools where taxpayers have to uh taxpayer money is used uh and given to private
[1:10:08.360 --> 1:10:13.640]  schools is done as part of a reform movement ostensibly but you can see where it goes wrong
[1:10:13.640 --> 1:10:19.480]  and we have in the studio with us right now uh mark hall who's done a documentary talking about
[1:10:19.480 --> 1:10:24.840]  how this has gone wrong already here in the united states and of course the man who has been accused
[1:10:24.840 --> 1:10:29.240]  by the turkish government of uh starting a coup against them i believe is starting a coup in
[1:10:29.240 --> 1:10:35.880]  america against our educational system as islamifying our educational system welcome uh mark
[1:10:35.880 --> 1:10:39.960]  david thanks for having back on info wars really appreciate it well i want to get you back on
[1:10:39.960 --> 1:10:45.320]  because since we last talked your film has been finished it's premiered it ran in new york for a
[1:10:45.320 --> 1:10:50.600]  week the new york times refused to even review it you tried to get it on numerous you have
[1:10:50.600 --> 1:10:54.760]  been able to get into some film festivals they highly recommended your film as do i because i've
[1:10:54.760 --> 1:11:00.360]  seen uh the film i saw a rough cut of it i haven't seen the the finished version but i saw a nearly
[1:11:00.360 --> 1:11:05.880]  finished version of it it's a very well produced film and um you tried to get on the film festivals
[1:11:05.880 --> 1:11:10.440]  here in texas and this is a story that has a lot of texas interest in it because there are more of
[1:11:10.440 --> 1:11:16.360]  these gullinist schools here in texas there's 45 of them about a third of the schools that are here
[1:11:16.360 --> 1:11:20.840]  in the united states are here in texas this is an individual that gets about a half a billion
[1:11:20.840 --> 1:11:24.520]  dollars you know as part of this network these schools are all connected together and yet you
[1:11:24.520 --> 1:11:32.120]  couldn't get any of these film festivals here to run it yes that's correct we applied for admission
[1:11:32.120 --> 1:11:38.680]  to the four largest film festivals in texas none of them would show the film um we've had
[1:11:38.680 --> 1:11:44.200]  tremendous difficulty getting the press here in texas as well as elsewhere to cover this issue
[1:11:44.200 --> 1:11:49.080]  the connection between the gullin movement uh and the charter schools and of course as you've
[1:11:49.080 --> 1:11:54.280]  said the taxpayer funds that are supporting these charter schools and i want to add one thing too
[1:11:55.000 --> 1:12:00.840]  that it's not just our tax dollars here in texas we're funding gullin charter schools
[1:12:00.840 --> 1:12:07.400]  upwards of 200 million dollars a year of that 500 million dollars but it's also bond money
[1:12:07.400 --> 1:12:13.720]  so the gullin movement and their harmony schools in texas have raised over 300 million dollars in
[1:12:13.720 --> 1:12:20.760]  the last i guess five or six years and they've just raised 44 million dollars and of that all
[1:12:20.760 --> 1:12:27.640]  of those funds are guaranteed by the people of texas against the future taxes that we're going
[1:12:27.640 --> 1:12:34.360]  to pay absolutely and not only that those bonds are paid back by tax dollars so it's a real racket
[1:12:34.360 --> 1:12:37.800]  right mm-hmm yeah and of course when we talk about the racket one of the things that you
[1:12:37.800 --> 1:12:43.560]  point out in the documentary you've got people who were people who are teaching there as whistleblowers
[1:12:44.280 --> 1:12:49.720]  one of the issues has been brought up by people look investigating this of course it's been
[1:12:49.720 --> 1:12:54.680]  investigated by the fbi primarily because of the way they have allocated contracts you know they
[1:12:54.680 --> 1:12:59.080]  get public money and they have to put these contracts for building schools up for open
[1:12:59.080 --> 1:13:05.080]  bidding and yet uh tell us what's happened in that process well incredibly uh the gullin
[1:13:05.080 --> 1:13:10.680]  charter schools have been building new schools they've been using turkish um construction
[1:13:10.680 --> 1:13:14.280]  companies that are based here in the united states that are owned by gullin followers
[1:13:14.920 --> 1:13:18.600]  and essentially that's one of the ways that they scam millions of dollars back to their
[1:13:18.600 --> 1:13:25.000]  non-educational goals of which i believe some of that money our us tax dollars our texas tax
[1:13:25.000 --> 1:13:30.440]  dollars went to fund this coup this violent coup in turkey where almost 300 people have died
[1:13:31.080 --> 1:13:37.320]  um it's very interesting to see the money flows it's very interesting to see the people involved
[1:13:37.320 --> 1:13:43.080]  there's no doubt in my mind that this was a gullin movement initiated coup yeah let's talk about
[1:13:43.080 --> 1:13:48.040]  that because we had had a lot of interesting developments a lot of uh finger pointing as
[1:13:48.040 --> 1:13:54.120]  the coup was shut down really fairly quickly uh the initial reports made it look like this might
[1:13:54.120 --> 1:13:59.720]  break into a longer term civil war but uh the government was able to get this under control
[1:13:59.720 --> 1:14:05.720]  fairly quickly what we had in the aftermath of that was we had the turkish president erdogan
[1:14:05.720 --> 1:14:12.440]  blaming the us the cia gullin okay saying that they were behind this and we saw uh we see republican
[1:14:12.440 --> 1:14:15.720]  representatives like peter king saying well nobody in the obama administration really knew
[1:14:15.720 --> 1:14:20.840]  what was going on i think personally looking at this just my personal opinion is that uh
[1:14:20.840 --> 1:14:25.160]  they were kind of sitting on the sidelines to see who's going to come out on top before they
[1:14:25.160 --> 1:14:30.600]  jumped into anything i think they knew exactly what was going on with this and then in the
[1:14:30.600 --> 1:14:37.720]  aftermath of this you've had the turkish president uh and one of the people in his cabinet directly
[1:14:38.280 --> 1:14:44.200]  the person in his cabinet sula man soy lu i think is the way he pronounced his name his labor minister
[1:14:44.200 --> 1:14:48.840]  went farther than erdogan he suggested that the us was behind the coup and what has happened here
[1:14:48.840 --> 1:14:54.280]  of course turkey is a nato as part of nato they're trying to get into the european union
[1:14:54.280 --> 1:15:01.640]  and uh the turkish government has shut down uh any movement on a uh airbase in southern turkey
[1:15:01.640 --> 1:15:07.080]  that the that nato uses and he has implied that unless he gets his way with the extradition of
[1:15:07.080 --> 1:15:13.080]  gullin that that airbase may not be reopened and at the same time he has a foreign minister who
[1:15:13.080 --> 1:15:19.640]  accuses us of being part of that too yeah absolutely i mean let's go back a few years uh gullin has a
[1:15:19.640 --> 1:15:25.320]  green card he lives in salersburg pennsylvania he's surrounded by a hundred or so followers at his
[1:15:25.320 --> 1:15:31.560]  compound called the golden generation worship and retreat center um from that compound he's been able
[1:15:31.560 --> 1:15:39.320]  to manage his charter schools and direct his followers all across the united states um you
[1:15:39.320 --> 1:15:43.640]  mentioned insta like air force base and i think one of the things that's going on in the background
[1:15:43.640 --> 1:15:49.160]  right now is a very interesting negotiation between our state department and the foreign
[1:15:49.160 --> 1:15:52.760]  ministry there in turkey hang on we're gonna we got to take a break and we're gonna be right back
[1:15:52.760 --> 1:15:57.320]  we're talking to mark hall who has done a documentary about what's going on in turkey and the educational

[1:20:14.440 --> 1:20:24.840]  welcome back to the alex jones show on this sunday july 17th 2016 i'm david night in studio as i
[1:20:24.840 --> 1:20:31.720]  said before alex and crew are on their way to the rnc and cleveland they will be broadcasting
[1:20:31.720 --> 1:20:35.640]  live from there this week a lot of special reports we have a lot of reporters that are
[1:20:35.640 --> 1:20:40.680]  going to be at the republican national convention but of course on friday we had this coup that
[1:20:40.680 --> 1:20:45.400]  began in turkey it's now been put down we've had about 6 000 people arrested in the crackdown
[1:20:45.400 --> 1:20:49.400]  about 290 is the latest count of people that we believe have been killed
[1:20:49.400 --> 1:20:53.800]  about 2,800 soldiers are being held in prison and you can see the pictures up on the dredge
[1:20:53.800 --> 1:21:00.280]  report how erdogan is humiliating them stripping them naked and having them lay next to each other
[1:21:00.280 --> 1:21:06.920]  and on top of each other taking their picture about 2,745 judges have faced arrest we've had
[1:21:06.920 --> 1:21:11.560]  a civil war going on in turkey that hasn't really been covered by a press for quite some time
[1:21:11.560 --> 1:21:15.800]  and the two sides of that civil war i would say wouldn't you say mark and of course i have with me
[1:21:15.800 --> 1:21:21.320]  a documentary filmmaker mark hall who did the film killing ed he looked at the worst case
[1:21:21.320 --> 1:21:26.680]  scenario of charter schools and that worst case scenario that we've got going on right now is
[1:21:27.400 --> 1:21:33.560]  a school network a large charter school network that is being run by a turkish imam
[1:21:33.560 --> 1:21:41.320]  gul fatala gulen who is really kind of the polar opposite of erdogan and turkey they're the two
[1:21:41.320 --> 1:21:46.360]  power centers that are going on there there are some constitutionalists and some secularists that
[1:21:46.360 --> 1:21:51.720]  are there but of course our cia and our government has been involved with the two islamists there
[1:21:51.720 --> 1:21:57.880]  the guy who is the president erdogan and then fatala gulen who is here in america and what i'm
[1:21:57.880 --> 1:22:02.120]  most concerned about and what you're very concerned about and what your documentary killing ed talks
[1:22:02.120 --> 1:22:08.040]  about is really the coup that is taking place against the american educational system and we
[1:22:08.040 --> 1:22:15.480]  have to understand how the charter school system can be taken over not only by crony capitalists
[1:22:15.480 --> 1:22:21.240]  but also by someone who wants to come in and indoctrinate and islamify or i guess we could
[1:22:21.240 --> 1:22:27.160]  say the turkification of the american educational system talk to us a little bit about what happens
[1:22:27.160 --> 1:22:32.680]  in these schools that are sold as science and math schools here in the united states
[1:22:32.680 --> 1:22:38.840]  yeah absolutely david these schools hold themselves out is as stem academy science technology
[1:22:38.840 --> 1:22:44.520]  engineering and math specialized schools they operate in 26 different states around the country
[1:22:44.520 --> 1:22:50.760]  there's about 150 now several more will be opening in the next school year including three here in
[1:22:50.760 --> 1:22:58.200]  texas um they are generating an excess of 500 million dollars a year from different states
[1:22:58.200 --> 1:23:03.880]  through tax dollars uh when you look at the schools and we actually interview several teachers who
[1:23:03.880 --> 1:23:09.720]  have taught in gulen charter schools um there's some real questions about high test scores which
[1:23:09.720 --> 1:23:15.320]  they all claim to have as well as every child going to college one of the things we show in the film
[1:23:15.320 --> 1:23:21.000]  is that the gulen movement has actually established its own universities one of which is in houston
[1:23:21.000 --> 1:23:26.840]  called the north american college so they can say yeah all of our kids that graduate from harmony
[1:23:26.840 --> 1:23:33.160]  or magnolia in california or concept schools in the midwest they all go to college because they
[1:23:33.160 --> 1:23:39.880]  all apply to these schools where they're guaranteed to be accepted by gulen by these gulen universities
[1:23:39.880 --> 1:23:46.360]  it's very interesting and also the things that are very troubling are the mistreatment of special
[1:23:46.360 --> 1:23:51.800]  education children that we show in the film we had undercover video that was taken by teachers
[1:23:51.800 --> 1:23:59.400]  very concerned about this um discrimination against our teachers pay differences between
[1:23:59.400 --> 1:24:05.000]  the many turkish teachers that they bring in on h1b visas that are followers of futula gulen
[1:24:05.000 --> 1:24:12.280]  and also the film shows two different followers of the gulen movement that have left the movement
[1:24:12.280 --> 1:24:18.280]  to talk deeply about the corruption the immigration fraud the h1b visas that have been issued in the
[1:24:18.280 --> 1:24:24.920]  thousands to bring different followers of futula gulen to work in their schools or to work in the
[1:24:24.920 --> 1:24:32.360]  mini constellation of non-profit organizations and things like construction companies that are
[1:24:32.360 --> 1:24:39.320]  building the schools the corruption is is beyond belief many people believed they wouldn't believe it
[1:24:39.320 --> 1:24:45.160]  when we showed this film and you know it's my film six months ago when we were finishing it was
[1:24:45.160 --> 1:24:51.320]  called a conspiracy film there the only conspiracy here is the gulen conspiracy that's right factual
[1:24:51.320 --> 1:24:56.200]  we have first person point of view for many people that have been affected by this group
[1:24:56.200 --> 1:25:03.880]  negatively and it's time for our media to wake up to this i have to say uh you david were one of the
[1:25:03.880 --> 1:25:09.320]  few people to actually talk openly about the gulen movement in the united states other people like
[1:25:09.320 --> 1:25:16.440]  adam curry stephanie sol stall of 60 minutes um excuse me stephanie sol of new york times
[1:25:16.440 --> 1:25:21.640]  and leslie stall of 60 minutes were really the handful of people that reported on this i have
[1:25:21.640 --> 1:25:27.160]  to commend you for that well thank you you know when we see something like this we we don't we go
[1:25:27.160 --> 1:25:31.880]  through it and we look at it and if it's if it's true we don't no matter how crazy it sounds to
[1:25:31.880 --> 1:25:36.760]  people i mean this does sound crazy when you look at it and it is crazy but if it's true
[1:25:36.760 --> 1:25:40.360]  you've got to put this out there you know when we reported about this i did an article you're
[1:25:40.360 --> 1:25:45.320]  talking about uh getting on this i interviewed you and then shortly after that when uh the
[1:25:45.320 --> 1:25:51.400]  erdogan government began to sue the gulen network here in america i report on that lawsuit and i went
[1:25:51.400 --> 1:25:57.160]  back and and reported some on our interview that we had had when your first came out and that was
[1:25:57.160 --> 1:26:03.560]  december 14th and then within two weeks we got our site hacked and it was interesting that what
[1:26:03.560 --> 1:26:09.320]  and when they hacked our site what they put up was a story supposedly coming from me okay and i
[1:26:09.320 --> 1:26:14.120]  write very few articles here at info wars but a story coming from me saying breaking coup d'etat
[1:26:14.120 --> 1:26:18.840]  in turkey erdogan flees to us airbase and talking about how it was a military coup in turkey
[1:26:18.840 --> 1:26:24.280]  essentially predicting this seven and a half months earlier a warning to us a warning to
[1:26:24.280 --> 1:26:30.040]  erdogan i guess they thought we were erdogan's surrogate here criticizing gulen we don't see
[1:26:30.040 --> 1:26:34.440]  erdogan as a good guy either and i thought it was interesting when i saw this happening
[1:26:35.480 --> 1:26:39.400]  on friday that there was a turkish coup going on there i said oh what's happened
[1:26:39.400 --> 1:26:43.480]  with the gulen movement this week so i quickly looked to see what had happened the preceding
[1:26:43.480 --> 1:26:47.720]  week i saw there had been multiple arrests of people that had been accused of being gulenists
[1:26:47.720 --> 1:26:52.440]  that even though they had court cases before they had the largest indictment they'd ever had
[1:26:53.080 --> 1:26:58.040]  gulen himself and many others were facing multiple life sentences being with the accusations
[1:26:58.040 --> 1:27:04.200]  from the erdogan movement and that indictment had been delivered just the day or so before that
[1:27:04.200 --> 1:27:09.480]  and just two hours before the coup began they had delivered that indictment wanting an extradition
[1:27:09.480 --> 1:27:16.040]  of fatala gulen from pennsylvania back to turkey and then the coup begins okay so i kind of don't
[1:27:16.040 --> 1:27:21.560]  think that it was a false flag by erdogan i i think that all indications point to the fact
[1:27:21.560 --> 1:27:26.760]  that it is possibly this guy who is trying to take over our us educational system well what
[1:27:26.760 --> 1:27:33.000]  i was told over the last two days since the coup occurred is that this has nothing to do with
[1:27:33.000 --> 1:27:39.640]  erdogan uh you know creating his own coup um they would have asked for gulen's extradition anyway
[1:27:39.640 --> 1:27:47.160]  yeah uh those files as you say were uh finally finished uh on friday the morning before the
[1:27:47.160 --> 1:27:51.560]  coup there were some other things happening in the background in turkey as i understand it there
[1:27:51.560 --> 1:27:57.400]  were a number of uh military officers and other people that are in the turkish military that are
[1:27:57.400 --> 1:28:03.720]  followers of gulen because gulen has infiltrated the turkish military uh their judiciary their police
[1:28:03.720 --> 1:28:10.200]  force they have a lot of people in the media um in turkey but anyway these particular um men in
[1:28:10.200 --> 1:28:14.200]  the military were followers of fatala gulen and they were going to lose their commissions so this
[1:28:14.200 --> 1:28:20.440]  was a last moment attempt i believe to prevent the gulen movement from actually being completely
[1:28:20.440 --> 1:28:25.960]  eradicated from turkey but it's still our problem here in the united states that's the key thing is
[1:28:25.960 --> 1:28:31.720]  lives here in the united states he earns millions and millions of dollars from taxpayers here
[1:28:31.720 --> 1:28:36.120]  any operates our schools here many many charbots charter schools we're going to talk about that we're
[1:28:36.120 --> 1:28:41.080]  also going to talk about the leverage that erdogan has against the united states with these uh nuclear
[1:28:41.080 --> 1:28:45.080]  weapons at this airbase that they closed down they said they're not going to open up that airbase
[1:28:45.080 --> 1:28:49.640]  unless they get their extradition and of course there's a lot of nuclear weapons there we're going
[1:28:49.640 --> 1:28:54.920]  to talk about the details of that with marco killing ed is the film you can buy it at amazon.com we'll

[1:33:11.000 --> 1:33:18.840]  crashing through the lies and disinformation it's alex jones on the gcn radio network
[1:33:18.840 --> 1:33:29.320]  welcome back to the alex jones show i'm david night and i'm here with documentary filmmaker
[1:33:29.320 --> 1:33:35.800]  mark hall his film is killing ed and we're talking about not only the turkish coup and the two different
[1:33:35.800 --> 1:33:42.280]  polls and political polls in turkey we're also talking about a coup that is really coming
[1:33:43.000 --> 1:33:47.080]  at our educational system here in america through the charter school system and that's
[1:33:47.080 --> 1:33:53.080]  what his documentary film killing ed is about it is now you can get it on dvd at amazon dot com
[1:33:53.080 --> 1:33:56.600]  it's been shut down at a lot of film festivals because you know the way we do things now in the
[1:33:56.600 --> 1:34:01.480]  united states is if you don't agree with somebody on an issue you don't debate them you just make
[1:34:01.480 --> 1:34:06.600]  sure that you censor them and we see this happening with the vaxed documentary at tribeca they didn't
[1:34:06.600 --> 1:34:11.240]  like that documentary's content they didn't want the information to be out there they didn't feel
[1:34:11.240 --> 1:34:15.240]  like they could debate that we see that over and over again with the climate change debate they
[1:34:15.240 --> 1:34:24.120]  don't want to debate that they would rather shut it down and accuse people that are that disagree
[1:34:24.120 --> 1:34:28.760]  with them of being racketeering influence corrupt you know trying to come after them with a rico
[1:34:28.760 --> 1:34:34.520]  statue that's what we see now we see people trying to jail the competition but at least
[1:34:35.400 --> 1:34:41.080]  pervasively to censor a different idea than the mainstream media is trying to sell us so it's very
[1:34:41.080 --> 1:34:46.280]  important for us to get this information out i want to talk to mark now about this uh lawsuit
[1:34:46.280 --> 1:34:53.000]  that was filed by erdogan's lawyers and i understand it's erdogan yeah he corrected me in this i've
[1:34:53.000 --> 1:34:59.000]  been using the southern pronunciation here but this is a lawsuit that's been filed both in texas
[1:34:59.000 --> 1:35:06.280]  and california where there's a lot of the gulon schools in both of these states and they're looking
[1:35:06.280 --> 1:35:11.640]  at a couple of different issues one of them the h1b visa program which has gotten some discussion
[1:35:11.640 --> 1:35:16.440]  in terms of our open borders before we do real quickly i want to remind you that we have a sale
[1:35:16.440 --> 1:35:21.000]  now going on in dna force and of course that's one of our premier ingredients uh our premier
[1:35:21.000 --> 1:35:27.160]  supplements that we have uh one of the ingredients and it costs 30 000 per batch so this is a very
[1:35:27.160 --> 1:35:31.720]  expensive supplement that we have it's i think it's perhaps our most expensive supplement we have so
[1:35:31.720 --> 1:35:38.360]  this is a good time to stock up on it or to try it when it's 25 off you can look at the clinical
[1:35:38.360 --> 1:35:43.720]  studies a lot of people have done clinical studies on biopqq compound uh that's one of the key
[1:35:43.720 --> 1:35:49.000]  ingredients in this that's what makes it so expensive uh the extremely hard to secure extremely
[1:35:49.000 --> 1:35:56.840]  expensive to buy but biopqq is incredibly potent in terms of antioxidants it also has
[1:35:56.840 --> 1:36:03.720]  um coq 10 uh other digestive enzymes uh reserva trawl and many other things in that
[1:36:04.600 --> 1:36:09.080]  formulation of dna force but take a look at the studies take a look at the reviews on info wars
[1:36:09.080 --> 1:36:16.920]  dot com and uh get info uh get dna force right now while it's 25 off at info wars life dot com
[1:36:17.960 --> 1:36:21.880]  okay now mark uh let's talk a little bit about this lawsuit that's been filed uh
[1:36:21.880 --> 1:36:29.160]  uh by the lawyers for urdogan here it's uh filed with the texas educational agency talk to us about
[1:36:29.160 --> 1:36:34.200]  the issues with the h1b program and how they believe that is they alleged that's being abused
[1:36:34.920 --> 1:36:39.800]  well one of the things that's happened in the gulen charter schools is that there's been
[1:36:40.360 --> 1:36:46.600]  tremendous abuses of immigration our immigration system they brought in um not only teachers but
[1:36:46.600 --> 1:36:52.840]  they brought in um people like principals and accountants and of course these are displacing
[1:36:52.840 --> 1:36:58.120]  us workers i mean it's a real labor problem when we have so many people out of work in our country
[1:36:59.400 --> 1:37:02.840]  they bring in turkish teachers because one of the things that you find throughout
[1:37:03.480 --> 1:37:07.480]  the charter schools that are run by followers of fatoula gulen in the united states
[1:37:08.040 --> 1:37:13.480]  is that they teach a kind of turkish supremacism uh instead of teaching spanish they're teaching
[1:37:13.480 --> 1:37:19.560]  turkish language to our children here in texas that's amazing so it's really you know not a useful
[1:37:19.560 --> 1:37:24.040]  thing for those of us that are living on the border with mexico that's right um yeah you need to know
[1:37:24.040 --> 1:37:30.040]  not not mexico or spanish but you need anything about any of the countries around here or texas
[1:37:30.040 --> 1:37:33.240]  you need to know about turkey according to them and that's the amazing thing too when you talk
[1:37:33.240 --> 1:37:37.880]  about them bringing in people and they say in the lawsuit here legal counsel budget analysts human
[1:37:37.880 --> 1:37:42.840]  resource professionals principal superintendents counselors etc these are not positions for which
[1:37:42.840 --> 1:37:47.400]  they can't find americans to fill these jobs but the key thing i think people need to understand
[1:37:47.400 --> 1:37:55.240]  is that this is a school that is financed by the taxpayers so these are taxpayer paid positions
[1:37:55.240 --> 1:38:00.120]  they're bringing people in here instead of using americans to fill these positions in
[1:38:01.320 --> 1:38:06.360]  absolutely david and one of the things we show in the film uh through interviews with one of the
[1:38:06.360 --> 1:38:12.600]  former members of the gulen movement who taught at a charter school in ohio is that all teachers
[1:38:12.600 --> 1:38:19.320]  that come over on h1b visas they're followers of fatula gulen and they have sworn out an oath of
[1:38:19.320 --> 1:38:25.560]  secrecy as well as fealty let's say to fatula gulen and this islamic movement which is global in
[1:38:25.560 --> 1:38:30.920]  nature um and one of the things that they've sworn to is to kick back a certain amount of their
[1:38:30.920 --> 1:38:39.400]  income each pay period back to the gulen movement and to the compound in in uh salersburg pennsylvania
[1:38:39.400 --> 1:38:46.360]  where gulen lives um it's anywhere from between 10 and 30 of their salary it's kicked back in cash to
[1:38:46.360 --> 1:38:51.880]  a turkish administrator running these schools throughout our country and i believe that money
[1:38:51.880 --> 1:38:57.640]  is is definitely being used for non educational purposes and of course this could have gone back
[1:38:57.640 --> 1:39:03.240]  to turkey i don't want to speculate but i it would make sense to me that that money perhaps has been
[1:39:03.240 --> 1:39:09.320]  used to form in this coup yeah and of course it's not just that but it also alleges that that has
[1:39:09.320 --> 1:39:14.200]  been happening with the contractors who build the physical buildings there uh that that's one
[1:39:14.200 --> 1:39:18.280]  of the reasons why they don't put this up for competitive building is because that is filtering
[1:39:18.280 --> 1:39:23.240]  back to that organization one of the ways that they answered this statement and here's harmonies
[1:39:23.240 --> 1:39:28.840]  statement they say uh the rate of teachers under the h1b visas which are authorized and issued by
[1:39:28.840 --> 1:39:34.600]  the u.s federal government is only seven percent and decreasing each year that's why yeah exactly
[1:39:34.600 --> 1:39:38.440]  and that's what he says he said that this in response to that he says the statement is both
[1:39:38.440 --> 1:39:43.800]  misleading and false he says first of all they only talk about teachers and they exclude all these
[1:39:43.800 --> 1:39:48.760]  other issues that we're talking about in terms of lawyers human resource professionals budget
[1:39:48.760 --> 1:39:54.520]  analysts principles and so forth they exclude all that and harmony in fact identifies itself
[1:39:54.520 --> 1:39:59.880]  to the federal government as an h1b dependent which means that at least 15 percent at least 15
[1:39:59.880 --> 1:40:06.200]  percent of his workforce was hired through h1b visa program so they will reply to this
[1:40:06.200 --> 1:40:12.040]  lawsuit to the complaint to the texas education agency and say no it's only seven percent when
[1:40:12.040 --> 1:40:16.280]  they're telling the federal government that they have 15 percent or more well this is one of the
[1:40:16.280 --> 1:40:22.600]  things we can do as americans is we can petition organizations like the texas education agency
[1:40:22.600 --> 1:40:29.160]  as well as the similar agency in california that have both received these requests from the urdogan
[1:40:29.160 --> 1:40:35.560]  government of whom i do not agree with i believe both gulen and urdogan are political islam
[1:40:35.560 --> 1:40:41.080]  followers they're islamists we haven't been helping those that we really should have been helping
[1:40:41.080 --> 1:40:47.720]  in turkey and now we're facing the consequences of it this is a it's a story that is it's really
[1:40:47.720 --> 1:40:55.800]  truth is stranger than fiction but to get back to the h1b visa issue these h1b visa holders coming in
[1:40:55.800 --> 1:41:02.200]  that are gulen followers they are to be paid a prevailing wage that prevailing wage is to
[1:41:02.200 --> 1:41:07.720]  make sure that our american citizens our neighbors are not undercut by foreign labor it's a requirement
[1:41:07.720 --> 1:41:14.600]  by the department of labor what happens is the gulen members come in they may be paid 40 000
[1:41:14.600 --> 1:41:20.280]  or 44 000 a year for a position at the school for which they're not really qualified generally
[1:41:20.280 --> 1:41:24.520]  they're not certified we don't know their backgrounds and the deal is that they're
[1:41:24.520 --> 1:41:30.600]  going to kick back thousands and thousands of dollars per paycheck from that 44 000
[1:41:31.640 --> 1:41:36.360]  we interviewed a teacher at one of the schools and i've heard this over and over again
[1:41:36.360 --> 1:41:42.120]  he was paid maybe a fourth of what her turkish counterpart who had the same experience
[1:41:42.120 --> 1:41:48.280]  was paid at one of the harmony schools here in texas wow so it's a massive scam they're
[1:41:48.280 --> 1:41:53.160]  skimming money out of construction contracts and other contracts that gulen owners gulen
[1:41:53.160 --> 1:41:58.120]  follower owners are operating to service the schools to do other things here in the united
[1:41:58.120 --> 1:42:05.400]  states and it's something that our media our politicians our academicians everyone should
[1:42:05.400 --> 1:42:09.400]  be a concerned about we're talking about people not being concerned about it we've got a lot of
[1:42:09.400 --> 1:42:14.840]  officials who are given junkets to go to turkey okay it's a lot of congressmen a lot of local
[1:42:14.840 --> 1:42:22.120]  officials our police chief here they send them on junkets to turkey and push turkish culture
[1:42:22.120 --> 1:42:25.960]  and other things to them i don't know what else is going on on these junkets but you know it they
[1:42:25.960 --> 1:42:31.240]  present themselves as being schools of science and math why because so many people are fed up
[1:42:31.240 --> 1:42:36.360]  with what bill errs and his people have done to our educational system turning them into social
[1:42:36.360 --> 1:42:40.760]  justice warriors where they don't learn anything they're simply indoctrinated so they know people
[1:42:40.760 --> 1:42:47.080]  are hungry for science and math and yet only 42 percent of these turkish teachers uh teach math or
[1:42:47.080 --> 1:42:51.880]  science okay it's it's a game that they're playing here to take over our educational system stay with

[1:47:29.400 --> 1:47:35.640]  producer of killing ed you can now get this on dvd at amazon dot com you need to see this film
[1:47:35.640 --> 1:47:40.280]  because you need to understand it's not just the turkish coup that's going on but we have a coup
[1:47:40.280 --> 1:47:44.360]  going on against our educational system we're just talking about this how difficult it is for people
[1:47:44.360 --> 1:47:51.160]  to understand uh some of these things where they reach uh so far people say that that can't be
[1:47:51.160 --> 1:47:56.280]  possible i can't imagine a situation we've got a turkish mom who comes here with the help and
[1:47:56.280 --> 1:48:02.440]  the assistance of the cia and then they set up a uh a system using charter schools get a half a
[1:48:02.440 --> 1:48:09.160]  billion dollars a year to try to uh take our children towards uh islamification in this country
[1:48:09.160 --> 1:48:15.240]  not just in turkish but you know that's the reality that he shows in this documentary killing ed
[1:48:15.240 --> 1:48:20.520]  and i want to go back to what he has to tell us about the nukes at the air force base uh
[1:48:20.520 --> 1:48:25.400]  we need to take a look at what's going on with erdogan as well erdogan uh what is happening
[1:48:25.400 --> 1:48:30.040]  with his connection with nato how he is going to be blackmailing the united states to get his
[1:48:30.040 --> 1:48:35.800]  rival fatali gulen extradited i think he's going to be blackmailing them with this base which
[1:48:35.800 --> 1:48:40.680]  also as mark pointed out has a lot of nuclear weapons on it as well before we do real quickly i

[1:50:23.080 --> 1:50:31.160]  because of bio pqq 25 off right now at info wars life dot com mark let's talk a little bit about
[1:50:31.160 --> 1:50:37.080]  the connection and as we between all these different schools the various schools operate in
[1:50:37.080 --> 1:50:41.480]  different jurisdictions under different names like here in texas we have the harmony schools in
[1:50:41.480 --> 1:50:46.600]  california they go by what's the name magnolia magnolia schools okay and they say well we're not
[1:50:46.600 --> 1:50:53.640]  connected but you document how they are connected uh in your uh documentary killing ed let's take a
[1:50:53.640 --> 1:50:58.600]  real quick look at a a clip from the documentary where you show how they are connected
[1:51:02.200 --> 1:51:08.120]  gulan charter school operators will claim that their schools are unrelated they'll also will
[1:51:08.120 --> 1:51:15.480]  claim no connection to the gulan charter schools that are abroad there is um always a way to find
[1:51:15.480 --> 1:51:23.240]  out that these schools indeed are connected um they often use the same uh text in their welcome
[1:51:23.240 --> 1:51:28.840]  letters these are welcome letters that are maybe um posted at the beginning of a student handbook
[1:51:28.840 --> 1:51:35.880]  for the year so you have here the bay area technology school in oakland and the second
[1:51:35.880 --> 1:51:41.080]  paragraph says they take as a reflection of all of us all of our policies are intended to provide a
[1:51:41.080 --> 1:51:46.680]  safe and orderly environment that will be conducive to learning but then you have um the school in
[1:51:46.680 --> 1:51:52.200]  pennsylvania yscp is a reflection of us all our policies are intended to provide a safe and orderly
[1:51:52.200 --> 1:51:57.320]  environment that will be conducive to learning oklahoma discovery school of tulsa is a reflection
[1:51:57.320 --> 1:52:01.000]  of us all all of our policies are intended to provide a safe and orderly environment that
[1:52:01.000 --> 1:52:06.680]  we condo succ to learning tajikistan ditjanaabe international school is a reflection of all of
[1:52:06.680 --> 1:52:11.680]  All of our policies are intended to provide a safe and orderly environment that will be conducive to learning.
[1:52:11.680 --> 1:52:16.680]  Ethiopia, Najashi Ethio Turkish International School is a reflection of all of us.
[1:52:16.680 --> 1:52:20.680]  Hong Kong, the Rosebud Primary School, a reflection of all of us.
[1:52:20.680 --> 1:52:23.680]  The school in Korea, a reflection of all of us.
[1:52:23.680 --> 1:52:27.680]  Massachusetts, Hampton Charter School of Science is a reflection of all of us.
[1:52:27.680 --> 1:52:29.680]  Magnolia School, same sentence.
[1:52:29.680 --> 1:52:36.680]  These are all schools that will deny a connection with one another.
[1:52:36.680 --> 1:52:38.680]  So they pretend that they're all independent schools.
[1:52:38.680 --> 1:52:40.680]  They pretend that they're schools of science and math.
[1:52:40.680 --> 1:52:46.680]  And yet, as you just documented, as people just saw and heard, they are all connected.
[1:52:46.680 --> 1:52:53.680]  Yeah, generally speaking, this is just one example of the connections between the charter schools that we're paying for here in our country
[1:52:53.680 --> 1:52:59.680]  and the over a thousand other schools that the Gulen Movement operates in other countries.
[1:52:59.680 --> 1:53:06.680]  You can see Korea, Ethiopia, they're operating in Africa, essentially every continent except Antarctica.
[1:53:06.680 --> 1:53:09.680]  And that might be soon, who knows.
[1:53:09.680 --> 1:53:11.680]  But they're operating these schools.
[1:53:11.680 --> 1:53:14.680]  Certain people have called this the education jihad.
[1:53:14.680 --> 1:53:23.680]  The Gulen Movement has also been called by Daniel Pipes, jihad or Islamism 2.0,
[1:53:23.680 --> 1:53:29.680]  because they're using our system to really get their political will established.
[1:53:29.680 --> 1:53:31.680]  Well, that is always the case.
[1:53:31.680 --> 1:53:35.680]  People have to understand that when they turn their children over to the schools,
[1:53:35.680 --> 1:53:38.680]  you're turning your children over to people in many cases.
[1:53:38.680 --> 1:53:39.680]  You don't know what their background is.
[1:53:39.680 --> 1:53:40.680]  You don't know what their agenda is.
[1:53:40.680 --> 1:53:44.680]  And that's why we've looked at so many different aspects, whether it is Common Core,
[1:53:44.680 --> 1:53:50.680]  whether it is the social justice warrior indoctrination that's going on in our schools now.
[1:53:50.680 --> 1:53:56.680]  People need to understand who these people are that are setting the values for the educational system.
[1:53:56.680 --> 1:53:59.680]  They're not really concerned whether Johnny can read or write.
[1:53:59.680 --> 1:54:05.680]  They're really concerned about getting these kids and bringing them into their political point of view.
[1:54:05.680 --> 1:54:08.680]  And that's what we've seen from Plato and his Plato's Republic.
[1:54:08.680 --> 1:54:13.680]  That's what he advocated, making sure you don't know who your parents are in Plato's Republic.
[1:54:13.680 --> 1:54:15.680]  They wouldn't even know who their parents were.
[1:54:15.680 --> 1:54:16.680]  They would be raised by the state.
[1:54:16.680 --> 1:54:18.680]  The state would instill their values.
[1:54:18.680 --> 1:54:21.680]  And so we need to be very careful and understand when we look at these schools,
[1:54:21.680 --> 1:54:24.680]  these are the values that they're putting into your children.
[1:54:24.680 --> 1:54:31.680]  Well, I want to point out too that I don't believe that there's overt teaching of Islam in the schools.
[1:54:31.680 --> 1:54:33.680]  They're way too smart to teach.
[1:54:33.680 --> 1:54:35.680]  They don't want to lose that half billion dollars.
[1:54:35.680 --> 1:54:38.680]  They don't want to lose the tax money, and they understand that that would be a problem.
[1:54:38.680 --> 1:54:44.680]  However, I do believe, and I've researched this, and we could not put it in the film,
[1:54:44.680 --> 1:54:46.680]  but I do believe that there's conversions going on.
[1:54:46.680 --> 1:54:49.680]  I do believe that there's indoctrination going on.
[1:54:49.680 --> 1:54:54.680]  They generally take boys on trips, on overnight camping trips,
[1:54:54.680 --> 1:54:58.680]  that they think might be susceptible to joining the Gulen movement.
[1:54:58.680 --> 1:55:00.680]  It may be five or ten boys.
[1:55:00.680 --> 1:55:01.680]  The grooming people.
[1:55:01.680 --> 1:55:05.680]  The grooming people as a pedophile would groom them for their particular point of view
[1:55:05.680 --> 1:55:07.680]  for their religion and the sort of thing.
[1:55:07.680 --> 1:55:11.680]  That's what these trips to Turkey that they do with children with politicians
[1:55:11.680 --> 1:55:12.680]  are grooming the politicians as well.
[1:55:12.680 --> 1:55:14.680]  Well, I think you might be right.
[1:55:14.680 --> 1:55:16.680]  I mean, there's all kinds of corruption that's gone on.
[1:55:16.680 --> 1:55:21.680]  Our tax money has been used to send many thousands of children on summer trips
[1:55:21.680 --> 1:55:27.680]  from these schools to Turkey to spend time with the Turkish children at the schools there.
[1:55:27.680 --> 1:55:30.680]  They've sent many, many hundreds of our politicians.
[1:55:30.680 --> 1:55:33.680]  They've sent a congressional inquiry into this.
[1:55:33.680 --> 1:55:37.680]  People, even like Ted Poe, who's a very conservative Republican,
[1:55:37.680 --> 1:55:41.680]  went on one of these trips to Baku.
[1:55:41.680 --> 1:55:45.680]  It's just amazing to see who's been involved with this group.
[1:55:45.680 --> 1:55:48.680]  I think many of these politicians have been manipulated.
[1:55:48.680 --> 1:55:50.680]  They may not know exactly who they've been dealing with,
[1:55:50.680 --> 1:55:56.680]  but it's hundreds of politicians from the federal government all the way down to our locals.
[1:55:56.680 --> 1:56:00.680]  There's a common technique when we looked at the case of Justice Scalia dying.
[1:56:00.680 --> 1:56:05.680]  We look at situations where you'll have these people will take junkets and trips
[1:56:05.680 --> 1:56:09.680]  and then they'll use them to try to gain friendship and influence with people.
[1:56:09.680 --> 1:56:13.680]  And you can never know exactly what was going on with this.
[1:56:13.680 --> 1:56:17.680]  Was it a quid pro quo or are they just making close alliances and friendships with people?
[1:56:17.680 --> 1:56:19.680]  It's not clear, but let's talk about the other side of this.
[1:56:19.680 --> 1:56:21.680]  We're talking about Fatala Ghulain,
[1:56:21.680 --> 1:56:23.680]  who's running this network of schools here in the United States.
[1:56:23.680 --> 1:56:27.680]  He obviously had help from the CIA getting here in the United States.
[1:56:27.680 --> 1:56:30.680]  We've also got Erdogan getting help from the CIA,
[1:56:30.680 --> 1:56:34.680]  and also Erdogan helping in turn being essentially a conduit for ISIS.
[1:56:34.680 --> 1:56:42.680]  We've seen the videos showing massive convoys of trucks bringing in oil into Turkey.
[1:56:42.680 --> 1:56:49.680]  They're laundering the ISIS oil for them and also acting as a conduit for weapons.
[1:56:49.680 --> 1:56:54.680]  So you've got different groups that want to get this guy out of Turkey as well.
[1:56:54.680 --> 1:56:56.680]  But he's got this base.
[1:56:56.680 --> 1:56:58.680]  Talk about the base and talk about the nukes that are there
[1:56:58.680 --> 1:57:01.680]  and the leverage that he's going to use to both stay in power
[1:57:01.680 --> 1:57:03.680]  and to try to get Fatala Ghulain extradited.
[1:57:03.680 --> 1:57:08.680]  Well, it's been reported that there's 90 nuclear warheads at the Insular Air Force Base in Turkey.
[1:57:08.680 --> 1:57:11.680]  And I understand there's some kind of strange agreement
[1:57:11.680 --> 1:57:14.680]  that 40 of those nuclear weapons are reserved for Turkey to use
[1:57:14.680 --> 1:57:18.680]  in case there's an incursion under Article 6 of the NATO agreement.
[1:57:18.680 --> 1:57:20.680]  I don't know particularly about that,
[1:57:20.680 --> 1:57:28.680]  but it has been reported that Erdogan is not allowing NATO missions from Incirlik.
[1:57:28.680 --> 1:57:32.680]  And I believe that he's using that as a bargaining chip right now
[1:57:32.680 --> 1:57:36.680]  to get Ghulain extradited quickly back to the United States.
[1:57:36.680 --> 1:57:37.680]  And who can blame him?
[1:57:37.680 --> 1:57:38.680]  Oh yeah, yeah.
[1:57:38.680 --> 1:57:40.680]  So that's his leverage right there.
[1:57:40.680 --> 1:57:43.680]  And of course, this is going to develop as we go through the various days.
[1:57:43.680 --> 1:57:44.680]  Thank you so much.
