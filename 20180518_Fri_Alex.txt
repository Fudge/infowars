[00:00.000 --> 00:29.000]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the Resistance, it's Alex Jones.
[00:30.000 --> 00:35.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, we are live. We are broadcasting worldwide from Austin, Texas.
[00:35.000 --> 00:42.000]  Our crew is already on the road to South Texas, just south of Houston, just north of Galveston, Texas.
[00:42.000 --> 00:50.000]  We're now at least 10 people are dead, including students and reportedly faculty and one wounded, perhaps dead police officer.
[00:50.000 --> 00:54.000]  We're getting conflicting reports. Obviously our prayers go out to everybody.
[00:54.000 --> 01:04.000]  This is a gigantic, sprawling high school in a suburb of Houston.
[01:04.000 --> 01:13.000]  And of course you've got rescue helicopters, you name it there. This has really, really turned out to be a terrible event about two hours ago when it first started.
[01:13.000 --> 01:20.000]  I was watching Fox and they weren't even sure anyone had been injured for a good 30 minutes, so they cut away from coverage.
[01:20.000 --> 01:29.000]  But I talked to Pat Riley, who works with us. He's got family in the town. In fact, he's got family that works in association with the school.
[01:29.000 --> 01:35.000]  And he was saying that it was a school shooting. And so I jumped right on that immediately.
[01:35.000 --> 01:43.000]  And by then it was two dead, four dead, six dead, eight dead, 10 dead and growing a true tragedy.
[01:43.000 --> 01:48.000]  And you know the gun grabbers are going to seize on this. They're going to blame all gun owners in America.
[01:48.000 --> 01:56.000]  They're going to misrepresent what we say about it. We know that the coward of Broward County, the head school resources officer,
[01:56.000 --> 02:02.000]  he just retired officially and began receiving $8,000 plus a month.
[02:02.000 --> 02:10.000]  We saw a stand down in Sandy Hook as well. Was there a stand down here? Doesn't sound like it. One officer is down.
[02:10.000 --> 02:21.000]  But report there's only a couple of school resource officers for this gigantic 5a sprawling school, one of the biggest in the state of Texas in a bedroom community of Houston.
[02:21.000 --> 02:27.000]  Again, coward deputy who stayed outside during Parkland school shooting.
[02:27.000 --> 02:34.000]  New York Daily News reports receives $8,700 a month pension. Unbelievable.
[02:34.000 --> 02:42.000]  Now, our hearts go out to those that are wounded and those that are dead and their families. But remember, 10,000 plus die a year in swimming pools.
[02:42.000 --> 02:47.000]  Tens of thousands die falling down on wet pavement or in their bathrooms.
[02:47.000 --> 02:57.000]  56 people on average. If you average the numbers out from 1990 to now, and the numbers about flat, still too many, but the numbers still flat.
[02:57.000 --> 03:04.000]  Less than 60 people die in school shootings, period, every year. It's a terrible thing.
[03:04.000 --> 03:17.000]  But the way the media seizes on it and the issues of the kids with their hands up and the hours of waiting and not knowing what's going on, it tears the guts out of a parent.
[03:17.000 --> 03:26.000]  I know I've got four children and it just makes me know that despite the fact there's some pretty good public schools in some areas of this country,
[03:26.000 --> 03:34.000]  I would not send my children to public school because this is where the media advertises that you go kill people if you want to have death by cop.
[03:34.000 --> 03:40.000]  Or if you want to go out and be infamous, then they hype it and turn it into the number one issue in the world.
[03:40.000 --> 03:46.000]  And of course, there's going to be copycatch. You know, during the 60s and 70s, there were over 500 bombings in this country.
[03:46.000 --> 03:55.000]  But the media didn't give them attention. They covered them but didn't harp on them because it gave the terrorists the power that they wanted to terrorize.
[03:55.000 --> 04:00.000]  You're going to see the marches. You're going to see it right through as school closes.
[04:00.000 --> 04:07.000]  I felt like we were running towards a finish line. I've set this on air just this week for no school shootings in the last few weeks of school.
[04:07.000 --> 04:15.000]  And yet it's happened again. Now, statistically, your children are pretty safe in public schools from mass shootings.
[04:15.000 --> 04:25.000]  50-something a year. It's too many. But if you take a country of 330 million people, and what? Are there something like 50 million people in school or more?
[04:25.000 --> 04:33.000]  50-something out of 50-something million, that's one person out of a million in schools is going to get killed.
[04:33.000 --> 04:39.000]  And it's too many. But the whole way the media hypes it like, never one more dead person.
[04:39.000 --> 04:45.000]  We can't ever have that happen again. So when there's another school shooting, they go, see? All you gun owners are to blame.
[04:45.000 --> 04:51.000]  There are even more people dying or you're getting stabbed to death at schools, but the media doesn't cover it.
[04:51.000 --> 05:10.000]  Now, when we get back, Pelosi has made a sickening statement. Wait till you see this.
[05:21.000 --> 05:27.000]  There's a powerful probiotic supplement with 20 of the most potent clinically studied probiotic strains.
[05:27.000 --> 05:32.000]  When paired with carnivore, our incredible enzyme formula that helps you break down nutrients.

[06:21.000 --> 06:35.000]  Well, ladies and gentlemen, a couple hours ago, I was sitting there getting ready for the broadcast at home, had Fox News on,
[06:35.000 --> 06:46.000]  was on the Drudge Report, was on Info Wars, and I saw the Fox News anchors cutting away from the news of a school shooting because they couldn't confirm it had even happened.
[06:46.000 --> 06:54.000]  Well, I began to make some phone calls and checked local news, and it shows how scripted national news is, CNN, all of them.
[06:54.000 --> 06:56.000]  It took them over an hour to know what was happening.
[06:56.000 --> 07:05.000]  Texas news knew right away that there were multiple dead people, and now it's up to 10, so it's a real tragedy.
[07:05.000 --> 07:12.000]  The governor says he's on his way to Santa Fe High School. We'll be brief soon. Press conference at 1 p.m. to provide update.
[07:12.000 --> 07:27.000]  Owen Schreuer and more of our crew are loading up as we speak. I mean, I've already left. They were loading up about 15 minutes ago to beeline down to the coast, almost to the coast.
[07:27.000 --> 07:35.000]  In fact, I've driven by this hospital before. Pat Riley's got family from one of our crew members down there. He's also in contact with them.
[07:35.000 --> 07:44.000]  I am going to open the phones up for people that are in that area of South Texas.
[07:44.000 --> 07:59.000]  We have a computerized phone system. We can even check the caller ID, and we're going to have any eyewitnesses or people that have any information for us to be able to speak out because we have the same thing with the situation in Parkland.
[07:59.000 --> 08:08.000]  We had multiple students call in, later confirmed their identities. The media tried to deny it, but later had to confirm they were real, saying that the police stood down.
[08:08.000 --> 08:17.000]  That is now confirmed. I don't know if that happened here, but we know it happened in all these blue state areas, blue city areas like Sandy Hook.
[08:17.000 --> 08:23.000]  There was a stand down obviously in Parkland, in Florida. That's all been confirmed.
[08:23.000 --> 08:35.000]  I don't know if this was a stand down because you have a police officer that was shot. That's not really Texas style to stand down, but Houston and surrounding areas are now blue.
[08:35.000 --> 08:50.000]  And we don't know if they fully drummed Texas outlaw enforcement in those areas completely, like they've done in LA or Baltimore or areas like Chicago where we know they stand down and are a bunch of cowards on average.
[08:50.000 --> 08:54.000]  It's just a fact. There are some good police officers still there.
[08:54.000 --> 09:03.000]  But this ties into something Nancy Pelosi said just last night that is unbelievable.
[09:03.000 --> 09:09.000]  We're going to get to that in a moment, but first up to 10 fatalities confirmed in Texas school shooting.
[09:09.000 --> 09:14.000]  Our prayers go out for those that have lost loved ones, those that are injured.
[09:14.000 --> 09:23.000]  This is very, very serious situation. Obviously, so pray for folks at that South Texas high school.
[09:23.000 --> 09:33.000]  We will continue to break down the latest as that unfolds, but up to 10 people have been killed at a school shooting in Santa Fe, Texas.
[09:33.000 --> 09:38.000]  Police confirmed that one person is in custody and a second person has been detained.
[09:38.000 --> 09:47.000]  A police officer is among those injured. Speaking to reporters, the scene a police spokesman said there had been between eight and 10 fatalities, including and I was watching the satellite feeds.
[09:47.000 --> 09:52.000]  We have live for you and live you indeed said that including students and school staff.
[09:52.000 --> 09:58.000]  A male student has been confirmed as the shooter.
[09:58.000 --> 10:08.000]  Images from the scene show the extent of the police presence with students lined up outside the premises.
[10:08.000 --> 10:17.000]  Now, before we go any further with that, this ties into the whole MS 13 situation.
[10:17.000 --> 10:21.000]  MS 13 is a central American gang that comes all the way up into Mexico.
[10:21.000 --> 10:26.000]  It rivals any other Latin American gang for violence and evil.
[10:26.000 --> 10:33.000]  They're estimated to have killed hundreds of thousands of people in Central America, Mexico and the United States.
[10:33.000 --> 10:43.000]  They mainly feed on Hispanics and have Trump openly in a video conference that we played yesterday that we have again to play now.
[10:43.000 --> 10:52.000]  He's asked about MS 13 by some sheriff's department people and Trump says, yeah, they're absolute animals.
[10:52.000 --> 10:59.000]  I don't think that's a strong enough word. How about monsters who are into a total death cult?
[10:59.000 --> 11:08.000]  Rivaling people like ISIS and the media cut off the front of him being asked about MS 13 so they could say,
[11:08.000 --> 11:17.000]  Trump just called all border crossers animals so that people like Spike Lee can go on TV years later and say that, you know, he said all Hispanics are animals.
[11:17.000 --> 11:23.000]  Everybody goes, yeah, yeah, this is the deception. This is the garbage.
[11:23.000 --> 11:28.000]  Well, MS 13 has killed thousands and thousands of people in the U.S.
[11:28.000 --> 11:34.000]  But when they kill somebody, it hardly even makes the news or in some cases,
[11:34.000 --> 11:39.000]  juries will just let people off and kill people to virtue signal.
[11:39.000 --> 11:46.000]  Now, AP and others have had to retract because he was clearly referring to MS 13, not saying border crossers are animals.
[11:46.000 --> 11:53.000]  I saw Juan Williams on Fox News this morning saying that, well, you know, Trump does still mean this and Trump's a bad guy.
[11:53.000 --> 11:58.000]  They're going to double down, but Nancy Pelosi took the cake because all this ties together.
[11:58.000 --> 12:07.000]  You've got 10 people dead with some deranged killer probably on serotonin reuptake inhibitors, just like the last shooter in Parkland was.
[12:07.000 --> 12:12.000]  And he'd been under government custody and he'd been on a crime prevention program because it was racist.
[12:12.000 --> 12:20.000]  They said to put anybody with a Hispanic last name in jail for burglary, vandalism, death threats, saying he'd school shoot.
[12:20.000 --> 12:26.000]  He should have been in a mental institution. He'd been in government custody. He'd been in a government facility.
[12:26.000 --> 12:36.000]  Look for that again, some isolated devil worship or drughead foster care type.
[12:36.000 --> 12:46.000]  But again, school shootings in the country, only about 56 on average every year die in a mass shooting at a school.
[12:46.000 --> 12:53.000]  It's still too much. It's still horrible. It's still terrible, even though 10,000 die again in their backyard swimming pools or in the lake.
[12:53.000 --> 12:59.000]  Thousands die on boats every year crashing into jet skis, but we don't have those blown out of proportion into the world.
[12:59.000 --> 13:04.000]  They do on guns because it can be blamed on gun owners.
[13:04.000 --> 13:12.000]  So they don't magnify what MS-13 does or how many cops they kill or all the methamphetamine they dump on the streets,
[13:12.000 --> 13:17.000]  or all the torturing and murder and devil worship that's what they're involved in as a cult.
[13:17.000 --> 13:23.000]  There's no coverage of that to speak of, but when there's a school shooting, they magnify it to project guilt on everybody.
[13:23.000 --> 13:31.000]  So in essence, Nancy Pelosi coming out and saying Trump shouldn't talk bad about MS-13, we're all God's children.
[13:31.000 --> 13:38.000]  And Juan Williams said the same thing this morning. I saw him on Fox News, what a disgraceful MPR reporter.
[13:38.000 --> 13:45.000]  By extension, she's saying with shooter that killed tenacious people and the numbers growing as they fight for their lives.
[13:45.000 --> 13:51.000]  By extension, she's saying that person's God's children and we shouldn't call him an animal or a monster.
[13:51.000 --> 14:00.000]  The guy that shot these people is worse than an animal. He's a monster and a piece of garbage and probably on government-pushed psychotropic drugs
[14:00.000 --> 14:06.000]  because almost every other one of them has been. So think about that.
[14:06.000 --> 14:13.000]  Nancy Pelosi is in essence saying don't call this guy an animal or a monster because she's saying about MS-13
[14:13.000 --> 14:19.000]  thousands of times worse conservatively than this killer in the aggregate.
[14:19.000 --> 14:27.000]  She's saying don't talk bad about them and they're all acting sad because the Democratic Party uses MS-13 to kill people.
[14:27.000 --> 14:34.000]  I have confirmed this with our law enforcement and army sources. I've confirmed it with CIA sources that the Democratic Party uses MS-13
[14:34.000 --> 14:41.000]  nationwide from Chicago to Dallas, Texas from Austin, Texas to LA.
[14:41.000 --> 14:50.000]  They use them as their secret army and they know Trump's got a war going against MS-13 and has wiped thousands of them out, arrested thousands more.
[14:50.000 --> 14:57.000]  Because what else isn't in the news when MS-13 fights back? They're getting smoked by the U.S. military all over this country right now
[14:57.000 --> 15:06.000]  and this Democrat dirtbags pissed. Her meth-dealing army is in the crosshairs. You dirty old evil globalist whore selling this country out.
[15:06.000 --> 15:12.000]  You're a pimp. Sorry, not a whore. You use us as whores. Here is the monster pig.
[15:12.000 --> 15:21.000]  We believe that some of us who are attracted to the political arena, to government and public service, that we're all God's children.
[15:21.000 --> 15:31.000]  There's a spark of divinity in every person on earth and that we all have to recognize that as we respect the dignity and worth of every person
[15:31.000 --> 15:37.000]  and as we recognize our responsibilities with that spark of divinity within us.
[15:37.000 --> 15:47.000]  And so when the President of the United States says about undocumented immigrants, these aren't people. These are animals.
[15:47.000 --> 15:52.000]  You have to wonder, does he not believe in the spark of divinity?
[15:52.000 --> 15:59.000]  So he's saying MS-13 is God. There you go. MS-13 is God.
[15:59.000 --> 16:09.000]  Were you born before the year 1956? If so, did you know you could be collecting between $575 and $2,200 in tax-free income right now?
[16:09.000 --> 16:20.000]  All thanks to the FHA. Or what about this? Did you know 54 U.S. congressmen have used a special tax-free account to earn up to 35 times more on their money?
[16:20.000 --> 16:31.000]  It's true and you can do it too. These are just two of the secrets revealed inside a stunning new book from the Palm Beach Research Group and Ted Benna, the man behind the 401K.

[18:00.000 --> 18:09.000]  Alex Jones here to tell you about how you can help spread Liberty worldwide while also enjoying what I have found to be the best tasting 100% organic coffee on the planet.
[18:09.000 --> 18:18.000]  For more than a decade, my favorite coffee has come from the high mountains of southern Mexico where the Chiapas farmers grow their unique shade-grown Arabica beans.
[18:18.000 --> 18:23.000]  They have now managed to secure the sought-after beans in a highly customized blend.
[18:23.000 --> 18:30.000]  Discover and try a bag of the Patriot Blend 100% organic coffee at infowarslife.com.
[18:30.000 --> 18:37.000]  This coffee gives you a long, smooth pick-me-up for hours without the headaches and heartburn that so many other coffees give me personally.
[18:37.000 --> 18:44.000]  Hands down, this is my favorite coffee, and it's taken us years to secure connections directly to the Chiapas Mexican farmers.
[18:44.000 --> 18:48.000]  If you buy the site today, order a bag or two, and I don't think you're going to be disappointed.
[18:48.000 --> 18:58.000]  Available in original or with our immune support infusion blend, you will be supporting a free press all the while enjoying a truly great tasting cup of my favorite coffee.
[18:58.000 --> 19:18.000]  Available at infowarslife.com.
[19:18.000 --> 19:28.000]  In the 1960s, researchers in France noticed that people who ate certain quail eggs experienced less seasonal immune and inflammatory responses.
[19:28.000 --> 19:39.000]  They began studying this effect in published trials, and decades later, we now have the fruit of this research, a fast-acting, chewable tablet that helps alleviate seasonal distress symptoms.
[19:39.000 --> 19:52.000]  In fact, current research has found that it actually acts by blocking the activity of triptase, which is an enzyme that amplifies immune and inflammatory responses in the body.
[19:52.000 --> 19:55.000]  Go outside and enjoy the air you breathe.

[20:32.000 --> 20:39.000]  Live from the Infowars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[20:39.000 --> 20:55.000]  We're in information war, we're using the truth in common sense and logic against the globalist. Nancy Pelosi has come out defending MS-13 saying they're all God's children and that they have a spark of divinity in them, ripping off a line from Mahatma Gandhi.
[20:55.000 --> 21:00.000]  He said we all have the seed of the universe within us.
[21:00.000 --> 21:14.000]  That does not mean the seed sprouts, and MS-13 is one of the most vile, vicious, torturing groups that even kills women and children when that's not something that flies in Latin America until they came along.
[21:14.000 --> 21:16.000]  Torture.
[21:16.000 --> 21:18.000]  Absolute evil.
[21:18.000 --> 21:20.000]  Kidnapping.
[21:20.000 --> 21:34.000]  People's children, they rape 80% of the women that they transport into the United States. They are monsters and they've been caught as the muscle for the Democratic Party and I've had military sources on the air.
[21:34.000 --> 21:43.000]  I've got sources that have been off air. In fact, I'm going to call some of my sources and I'm going to see if I can actually get them to come on the air.
[21:43.000 --> 21:46.000]  Some of them have been on the air before but not said who they've worked for.
[21:46.000 --> 21:55.000]  Yeah, they've been in the Marines, yeah they've been in the Army, but they've also done work since Trump got in in the Central Intelligence Agency dealing with the Democrats and MS-13.
[21:55.000 --> 22:04.000]  It is a fact they shipped the guns into Mexico to ship the guns into Al Qaeda and ISIS. It's a fact Fast and Furious was about arming MS-13.
[22:04.000 --> 22:07.000]  All this has come out.
[22:07.000 --> 22:16.000]  So Paul Watson just had the big article go live on infowars.com. We're in an information war. We need to get our talking points out ahead of theirs.
[22:16.000 --> 22:23.000]  They're going to say gun owners are to blame. They're going to say the NRA is to blame. They're going to say I'm to blame.
[22:23.000 --> 22:35.000]  They're going to try to block us on the Internet again like they did a few months ago during the tragic situation in Florida, lying about what we've said and done so that people don't actually hear what we really said.
[22:35.000 --> 22:40.000]  We're saying they advertise the schools as mass shooting facilities for crazy people.
[22:40.000 --> 22:52.000]  We're saying in almost every school shooting, I can't find one where it wasn't, a mass shooting where the person wasn't on psychotropic drugs of the Prozac serotonin reuptake inhibitor class.
[22:52.000 --> 23:02.000]  I can't find a time in recent memory where they weren't in some criminal protection racket like the Promise Program because Cruz had a Hispanic last name.
[23:02.000 --> 23:17.000]  He was adopted. He wasn't even Hispanic. He was let off for four and a half years threatening to kill people, robbing, stealing, vandalizing and committing crimes reportedly on a monthly basis.
[23:17.000 --> 23:21.000]  But they would not put him in jail or a mental institution.
[23:21.000 --> 23:35.000]  Then his foster parents died, both of them in two years. He was reportedly living on the streets or with friends and he was known as school shooter man.
[23:35.000 --> 23:43.000]  People had been calling 20 plus times, please stop him. He's going to kill. The FBI had been called three times. There was a stand down.
[23:43.000 --> 23:54.000]  We first had students on that confirmed it. What it's seeing into they told YouTube, take our YouTube channel down that we said nobody died.
[23:54.000 --> 24:03.000]  So they're going to blame the Second Amendment. They're going to blame Trump, despite the fact that since 1990, the unified crime statistics are clear.
[24:03.000 --> 24:17.000]  There's an average of 56 people dying and it's flat. 56 people die in school shootings a year. Half of them or so are drug related two or three people getting shot.
[24:17.000 --> 24:26.000]  The other half are these. What you just saw 14 in Florida. It's over 10 here. Couple others.
[24:26.000 --> 24:36.000]  School year is about to close out. Will it go above 56? The average probably not. Is it a tragedy? Absolutely.
[24:36.000 --> 24:42.000]  Are people fighting with their lives? You bet. But swimming pools kill over 10,000 people a year. Look it up.
[24:42.000 --> 24:57.000]  Swimming pools and lakes. Americans. More than 10,000 fall on wet concrete or wet tile or in their bathrooms. More than that. Gun deaths. 90% of them are suicide.
[24:57.000 --> 25:13.000]  Did you know that? Look it up. Yeah, there's 15,000 gun deaths a year and 90% of them in a whole country of 330 million people.
[25:13.000 --> 25:17.000]  You got 15,000 and most of it's suicide.
[25:17.000 --> 25:29.000]  So the articles on infowars.com, it's incredible. After defending MS-13 murderers that have killed tens of thousands in the U.S. total, left blames NRA for Santa Fe school shooting.
[25:29.000 --> 25:38.000]  The NRA is a terrorist organization that Democrats can want to say. No, you are a terrorist organization.
[25:38.000 --> 25:48.000]  You get this article out to everybody and get on the offense. Infowars.com. Newswars.com. Get that article out. My live feed.
[25:48.000 --> 25:57.000]  We're on hundreds of radio stations and TV stations. Tell folks about the station you're watching or listening to so they get an alternative view of what's happening, which is reality.
[25:57.000 --> 26:06.000]  Not every gun owner is to blame. Are truck owners to blame when another ISIS person runs over people? It happens every few weeks.
[26:06.000 --> 26:17.000]  It's hardly in the news. No, the truck's not to blame. The crazed killers to blame. But still, I want to stop this. The schools are advertised as mass shooting zones.
[26:17.000 --> 26:28.000]  The schools are advertised where crazies go. Why are they always on serotonin reuptake inhibitors? Why are they always in government custody? Why are they always being protected?
[26:28.000 --> 26:38.000]  Why do the police always stand down unless it's Texas? It appears the police did not stand down here or there would have been 50 dead.
[26:38.000 --> 26:46.000]  And what happened in Vegas? That was a gun running operation gone bad. We first broke it, now confirmed. Connected to fast and furious.
[26:46.000 --> 26:57.000]  With Saudi Arabia having a military convention with more than 7,000 people there. Amazing.
[26:57.000 --> 27:08.000]  Now, the stories on infowars.com, it's critical to get out to everybody. But I want to play this one more time. This is Nancy Pelosi who just joined us.
[27:08.000 --> 27:19.000]  Yesterday, misrepresenting what Trump said when it was about MS-13. And she's saying these are all God's children. In fact, they're a divine spark of life.
[27:19.000 --> 27:27.000]  So by extension, if she's saying mass murderers are good, is she saying the killer isn't an animal from this Texas high school?
[27:27.000 --> 27:36.000]  I say he's worse than an animal. He's a piece of crap, selfish, prozac head, demon-possessed, sack of garbage, and we don't even know who he is yet.
[27:36.000 --> 27:43.000]  But I'm willing to say the guy that went and killed a bunch of innocent people is a piece of crap.
[27:43.000 --> 27:50.000]  How dare you Pelosi say MS-13 mass murderers that kill thousands of people a year in the U.S. with guns.
[27:50.000 --> 27:58.000]  They're a large percentage of the people getting killed, but we don't even know about it because the media covers up for it because we know they work for the Democrats.
[27:58.000 --> 28:02.000]  They work for this monster pig. Player. Go ahead, player.
[28:02.000 --> 28:12.000]  We believe that some of us who are attracted to the political arena, to government and public service, that we're all God's children.
[28:12.000 --> 28:22.000]  There's a spark of divinity in every person on earth, and that we all have to recognize that as we respect the dignity and worth of every person,
[28:22.000 --> 28:27.000]  and as we recognize our responsibilities with that spark of divinity within us.
[28:27.000 --> 28:37.000]  And so when the President of the United States says about undocumented immigrants, these aren't people. These are animals.
[28:37.000 --> 28:45.000]  You have to wonder, does he not believe in the spark of divinity, the dignity and worth of every person?
[28:45.000 --> 28:52.000]  These are not people. These are animals. The President of the United States.
[28:52.000 --> 28:57.000]  Every day that you think you've seen it all, along comes another.
[28:57.000 --> 29:25.000]  My sack of garbage, witch.
[29:25.000 --> 29:29.000]  Fire your flies, water. Get your bug assault today.
[29:29.000 --> 29:31.000]  You have been lied to.
[29:31.000 --> 29:41.000]  My name is Kevin Ship. I'm a former decorated CIA officer. Finally, someone has come out and written what I think is the best ex-Mose on the shadow government ever.
[29:41.000 --> 29:47.000]  We're in a constitutional crisis, and our government is now being run and ruled by a shadow government.
[29:47.000 --> 29:56.000]  We've got to get this out, because just because you're awake, folks, doesn't mean other people are. This is critical to get, to read, to give them a library, to give them a church.
[29:56.000 --> 30:00.000]  Get them right now at killingunclesambook.com.

[33:03.440 --> 33:19.920]  We're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[33:19.920 --> 33:38.160]  Alex Jones, Jr.
[33:38.160 --> 33:42.000]  Some of them want to get used by you.
[33:42.000 --> 33:45.760]  Some of them want to abuse you.
[33:45.760 --> 33:48.480]  Some of them want to be a-
[33:48.480 --> 33:55.280]  Well, our hearts and our prayers go out to the at least 10 people dead at Santa Fe High School
[33:55.280 --> 33:59.680]  between Houston and Galveston, Texas, near the Texas coast.
[33:59.680 --> 34:04.320]  An area I've driven through many, many times on my way to go fishing or on vacation at the coast.
[34:04.320 --> 34:06.960]  With my family, I've driven by the big high school,
[34:06.960 --> 34:11.200]  right there on the side of the highway. It is a gigantic hospital.
[34:11.200 --> 34:18.240]  And Trump, early on Eastern time, about two hours ago,
[34:18.240 --> 34:21.760]  said school shooting in Texas, early reports not looking good.
[34:21.760 --> 34:24.960]  God bless all. He's also made a brief statement on that.
[34:24.960 --> 34:30.880]  Well, the usual suspects, but from the Democratic Party who love to go around
[34:30.880 --> 34:34.000]  on demonizing the Second Amendment are out.
[34:34.000 --> 34:39.280]  And that's the four students picked by the Democratic Party and by the Soros group
[34:39.280 --> 34:43.760]  to go around and give anti-gun speeches after Parkland and to blame all gun owners
[34:44.800 --> 34:49.840]  instead of the psychiatric system and the police and the local government and the promise program
[34:50.400 --> 35:00.080]  that stood down for four and a half years and protected the Parkland shooter, Nicholas Cruz.
[35:00.080 --> 35:08.160]  So now Trump slammed by Parkland survivors over insensitive tweet about school shooting.
[35:08.160 --> 35:11.520]  So I thought during the break, I said, well, let me see what this insensitive tweet is.
[35:12.880 --> 35:16.560]  School shooting in Texas, early reports not looking good. God bless all.
[35:16.560 --> 35:30.080]  Because as of 10 o'clock Eastern time, as of 10 o'clock Eastern time, an hour and a half
[35:31.440 --> 35:37.840]  ago, I guess that's two hours ago, they didn't even know that anybody had been killed yet.
[35:37.840 --> 35:46.640]  We didn't know till about an hour ago. So again, they take everything the president does. That's
[35:46.640 --> 35:59.040]  incredible. They take everything he does and then they spin it knowing that hours later,
[35:59.040 --> 36:05.280]  you know, there's 10 dead. And they make it look like, oh my God, he didn't even care about that
[36:05.280 --> 36:15.040]  because they take an earlier tweet from 10 o'clock Eastern and then put it out hours later
[36:16.640 --> 36:19.360]  and say, oh, look, he's tone deaf. He didn't talk about the dead.
[36:20.640 --> 36:24.800]  I was watching television two hours ago. I talked about that when we first went on air
[36:24.800 --> 36:30.240]  36 minutes ago and I said in the first segment, I was watching and Fox News even cut away because
[36:30.240 --> 36:34.560]  they weren't even sure anyone had gotten hurt. They said one girl had a bleeding leg.
[36:34.560 --> 36:39.440]  I shot a live video and said, well, I hope that's right. I hope this isn't a big shooting.
[36:39.440 --> 36:43.440]  And that's what the president was seeing as well. And I'm not here defending the president.
[36:43.440 --> 36:48.240]  I'm defending the truth. Just like they have law enforcement say, sir, MS-13's really kill a lot
[36:48.240 --> 36:52.400]  of people and kill a lot of border agents. We want to really get more funding to deal with them.
[36:52.400 --> 36:56.400]  He says, absolutely. They're a bunch of animals. They cut the question off.
[36:56.400 --> 37:07.120]  And the Nancy Pelosi comes out and says they are angels. They are divine. They are God's children.
[37:08.880 --> 37:14.560]  And that how dare Trump talk bad about MS-13. Now, you can argue I'm doing to her what she did
[37:14.560 --> 37:18.880]  to Trump because she knew full well as of last night what Trump had really said about that.
[37:18.880 --> 37:24.240]  And then it was an edited video as usual. So she chose to imply that he was still saying
[37:24.240 --> 37:29.760]  it about everybody coming across the border. So in essence, she's saying that MS-13 are a
[37:29.760 --> 37:35.120]  bunch of angels and as pure as a driven snow, even though they're the ones raping and killing
[37:35.120 --> 37:39.040]  and torturing the people that come across and leaving them locked up in 18 wheelers,
[37:39.040 --> 37:45.840]  if people don't pay double ransoms, because they're the muscle of the Democratic Party is MS-13.
[37:46.720 --> 37:49.360]  And I have that from the highest levels.
[37:49.360 --> 37:57.600]  Well, here's the latest, at least 10 dead at Santa Fe shooting in Texas and possible explosives found.
[37:59.040 --> 38:00.320]  This out of ABC News.
[38:02.720 --> 38:06.400]  At least eight people, they're saying dead. Now they're saying 10 after a student allegedly
[38:06.400 --> 38:11.200]  opened fire at Santa Fe High School in Texas this morning, sending students fleeing for their lives.
[38:11.200 --> 38:15.680]  Harris County Sheriff Ed Gonzalez said the number of deaths could be anywhere between
[38:15.680 --> 38:21.920]  eight and 10. Majority being students Gonzalez said the shooting has been contained at the school,
[38:21.920 --> 38:26.080]  has been evacuated, but possible explosive devices have also been found at the school
[38:26.080 --> 38:30.880]  and off the campus. The school district set authorities are working to render the devices safe,
[38:31.520 --> 38:32.480]  the district said.
[38:37.680 --> 38:42.240]  Now, I'm not saying this is a false flag in that the whole thing was staged and that the
[38:42.240 --> 38:47.520]  government did it or that Michael Bloomberg get it or George Soros did it.
[38:49.040 --> 38:54.400]  I'm saying if it turns out the police stood down, like they did in many of these other
[38:54.400 --> 39:00.080]  blue state areas, and this area of Texas is blue state now, Houston surrounding areas are total
[39:00.080 --> 39:07.120]  Democrat. If that comes out, or he was on Prozac or he was in some catch and release program for
[39:07.120 --> 39:13.760]  criminals like the Promise program that Nicholas Cruz was in, then yet again, they let it happen so
[39:13.760 --> 39:18.480]  they could sit there and shake their finger at the American gun owner and tell that we're all to blame
[39:18.480 --> 39:25.840]  because that's what happened in Coward County. And the head resource officer who stood down
[39:25.840 --> 39:33.120]  while it was going on for 15 minutes, he just got his $8,000 plus dollar a month pension.
[39:33.120 --> 39:41.120]  And the county has defended the Promise program that let Nick Cruz run rampant.
[39:43.520 --> 39:52.240]  $8,700 pension. But when we come back, I'm going to lay out some other scenarios because this is
[39:52.240 --> 39:57.040]  perfect timing. We know Vegas was a false flag. We know the globalists have been caught staging
[39:57.040 --> 40:01.920]  things, winding people up, protecting them before. And who knows what narrative this could be.
[40:01.920 --> 40:07.280]  When it's an Islamic attack, like San Bernardino, they cover up that it's an Islamic attack.
[40:07.280 --> 40:12.080]  The truck attack in New York a few months ago. They said that wasn't an Islamic attack. We made it up.
[40:12.080 --> 40:15.760]  Even though it was admittedly an attack, he screamed Allah Akbar and it's pled guilty to it.
[40:15.760 --> 40:22.160]  Oh, and they supposedly have the shooter in custody. Should have added that earlier at this
[40:22.160 --> 40:27.440]  Santa Fe tragic event. So who knows what we're going to find out. But hopefully soon that we've
[40:27.440 --> 40:32.160]  got live satellite feeds there from the press conferences. We'll be carrying live today.
[40:33.360 --> 40:39.840]  We'll also, ladies and gentlemen, be on target with our reporters, Owen shroyer and others on
[40:39.840 --> 40:46.400]  the ground who should be getting there in the next few hours or by the time the war room
[40:46.400 --> 40:53.360]  starts at three o'clock central today in about three hours and 20 minutes, they should be getting
[40:53.360 --> 41:04.960]  close down there. Now, I've got a lot of other MS 13 quotes here. This had really blown up the
[41:04.960 --> 41:10.400]  Democrats face. They didn't know what to do. They were losing approval rating points reportedly every
[41:10.400 --> 41:16.480]  hour. Some polls, some flash polls show a 10% drop just after they got caught trying to claim
[41:16.480 --> 41:25.360]  the president called all Hispanics animals when he was calling MS 13 animals. And then just right
[41:25.360 --> 41:30.400]  on time like the cavalry right towards the end of the school year, another victim disarmament
[41:30.400 --> 41:34.880]  zone mass shooting and the media will hype the living daylights out of this. Maybe they can get
[41:34.880 --> 41:39.840]  another mentally deranged person to go copycat. If they work hard, maybe they can. I pray that's
[41:39.840 --> 41:44.960]  not the case. But I think if you put your children in public schools that aren't armed like some of
[41:44.960 --> 41:49.680]  these other ones are now, you're insane. By the way, I've looked up the school. This was not a
[41:49.680 --> 41:54.320]  let the teachers be armed school. So that's an angle we should also be looking at. But make no
[41:54.320 --> 41:58.240]  mistake. Right now, the talking points are being written. They're being put out to blame the Second
[41:58.240 --> 42:05.920]  Amendment to blame gun owners. Boulder, Colorado just yesterday or just on Wednesday, two days ago,
[42:05.920 --> 42:13.280]  banned shimmy automatic rifles in high capacity. So they're coming for our guns. Make no mistake.
[42:13.280 --> 42:18.960]  But whatever you do, this is an information war. You're listening on local radio station,
[42:18.960 --> 42:24.080]  watching on local TV, local cable on the internet, on Facebook, YouTube, Twitter,
[42:24.080 --> 42:30.800]  info wars.com, Ford slash show, our live feeds, share those feeds and say, Hey,
[42:30.800 --> 42:34.400]  here's live coverage from Texas of what's really going on there.
[42:35.680 --> 42:39.440]  Alex Jones is breaking it down. See what they don't want you to see.
[42:39.440 --> 42:45.120]  Tomorrow's news today. We'll find out if there's any anomalies. This may be a straight up mass
[42:45.120 --> 42:50.960]  shooting, probably be a Prozac head. Didn't get enough attention from mommy and government protection
[42:50.960 --> 42:54.320]  and some liberal program. But it could be more. We'll be watching.
[42:59.760 --> 43:06.080]  I'm so excited. The new product at info wars life.com in a glass bottle, two month servings filled
[43:06.080 --> 43:12.880]  to the brim, filled to the absolute top, the real red bill. This is a heart and brain pill,
[43:13.600 --> 43:18.480]  a new tropic that doesn't have any stimulants in it. But boy, does it stimulate because it's
[43:18.480 --> 43:25.440]  beyond that. Quite frankly, I just went off what I saw medical doctors prescribing to their patients,
[43:25.440 --> 43:31.040]  but it wasn't prescription, but they were charging people $100, $200 for the formulae.
[43:31.040 --> 43:37.280]  And I came up with our own formula working with some scientists and developers non GMO made right
[43:37.280 --> 43:43.520]  here in America, 120 capsules. And ladies and gentlemen, you add the preglin own to it,

[47:24.880 --> 47:40.240]  Welcome back. I'm Alex Jones, your host on this sad Friday edition. We've got at least 10 dad at
[47:40.240 --> 47:46.880]  Santa Fe High School near the Texas coast to south of Houston by Galveston. And we've been
[47:46.880 --> 47:54.640]  reviewing police scanner tapes and first reports of what started about three and a half hours ago,
[47:54.640 --> 48:01.040]  about three hours and 15 minutes ago. And it looks like the police responded pretty quickly.
[48:01.040 --> 48:07.680]  And one officer was shot. We're not sure if he's alive. We're not sure of the condition.
[48:08.320 --> 48:12.080]  They're saying there is also some teachers that have been shot. The majority of people that were
[48:12.080 --> 48:19.520]  shot and killed are students. Again, this is the sixth society we live in. School shootings are very
[48:19.520 --> 48:25.120]  rare, but still 56 people killed in school mass shootings a year on average is bad.
[48:27.360 --> 48:34.080]  Now, MS 13 killing thousands a year is also bad. Many people they kill are children, but the media
[48:34.080 --> 48:40.080]  always plays it down. And when Trump calls them animals, they misrepresent it to demonize him.
[48:40.080 --> 48:45.840]  And Nancy Pelosi comes out and says that they are God's children and have divine souls.
[48:47.760 --> 48:54.320]  Very, very sick. Will she say of whoever this supposed shooter is who they say they have in
[48:54.320 --> 49:03.920]  custody? Well, they say that he has this divine soul. Now, they're reportedly looking at explosives
[49:03.920 --> 49:08.800]  at this individual's home. They reportedly have somebody else in custody. They reportedly also
[49:08.800 --> 49:14.640]  found what they believe are explosives at the school. So this sounds like Columbine 2.0 from what
[49:14.640 --> 49:25.600]  we saw 19 years ago. Oh, and Shroyer and some of our crew are high tailing it down to South Texas,
[49:25.600 --> 49:33.360]  Southeast Texas. As we speak, they should be there by the time the war room kicks off today.
[49:33.360 --> 49:41.360]  So we'll have a round table of our crew, myself and others in there when he gets there to give us
[49:41.360 --> 49:54.800]  live coverage on the ground. Now, that said, this appears to not be a stand down, preliminarily,
[49:54.800 --> 50:08.240]  like we saw in Vegas, like we saw in Parkland, and like we also saw then in some of the other events
[50:08.240 --> 50:23.440]  around the country. So we will track this as it all unfolds today. I also intend to open the
[50:23.440 --> 50:31.360]  phones up in the next hour. That's only seven minutes away, specifically for people that are
[50:31.360 --> 50:37.760]  Santa Fe, Texas students. It's a huge high school who are parents or who are family members or
[50:37.760 --> 50:42.400]  witnesses that live in the town. Every time we do this, if the rest of the callers won't call,
[50:42.400 --> 50:48.880]  please, we'll be able to get them on the line. We don't usually activate it. We have a computerized
[50:48.880 --> 50:54.160]  phone system that can take thousands of calls at a time, but we have caller ID. We'll be able to
[50:54.160 --> 50:59.920]  know if you're calling from that area code. Also, in the past when we had students on, we made them
[50:59.920 --> 51:06.720]  send us their IDs. We did this with some of the students we had on during Parkland, and CNN and
[51:06.720 --> 51:12.880]  Snopes said they were actors that we had brought in. Now, days later, they retracted it and said,
[51:12.880 --> 51:18.640]  no, those are real students. So they can claim that we've got actors on, but if we even point
[51:18.640 --> 51:24.000]  out that they've gotten people from the school acting club to be the anti-gun spokespersons,
[51:24.000 --> 51:28.800]  they then try to have us, quote, kicked off the air. Again, misrepresenting. Didn't say
[51:28.800 --> 51:36.640]  they were crisis actors. Didn't say that nobody died. We had three local news reports and eyewitnesses
[51:36.640 --> 51:43.680]  on the show who said there was a police stand down now confirmed. It also came out from our sources
[51:43.680 --> 51:51.200]  that he had been in a crime prevention program, an anti-racism program, where if you are not white,
[51:51.920 --> 51:58.080]  you don't go to jail for committing crimes most times. He was part of the promise program.
[51:58.080 --> 52:02.480]  And by the way, he was white, but he was adopted by a lady that had the last name Cruz.
[52:04.320 --> 52:12.160]  Now there it is, Sun Sentinel. School program allowed people like Cruz to commit crimes and not
[52:12.160 --> 52:22.720]  get in trouble. Truly is unbelievable. They say it. They don't let it slide.
[52:25.360 --> 52:31.600]  But meanwhile, the anti-gunners are on the news saying Trump's tweet at least an hour before
[52:31.600 --> 52:36.800]  the number of dead was even known was insensitive Senate 10 Eastern.
[52:36.800 --> 52:45.600]  When it wasn't even known if anybody was dead, they said it was insensitive because Trump
[52:46.640 --> 52:51.520]  was nebulous and said school shooting in Texas. Early reports not looking good. God bless all.
[52:52.880 --> 52:57.520]  Yeah, school shooting. Early reports not looking good. God bless all. Didn't know what was happening.
[52:57.520 --> 53:01.280]  Remember the time there was a bombing and he said, oh, there's been a bombing and they said, oh,
[53:01.280 --> 53:08.080]  you were right. It was a bombing, but it wasn't confirmed when you said it shut up. So now the
[53:08.080 --> 53:15.280]  usual suspects are slamming the president. Our children are being murdered and you're treating
[53:15.280 --> 53:19.680]  this like a game. This is the 20 second school shooting just this year. Do something.
[53:21.760 --> 53:26.800]  Yeah, and most of those shootings are drug dealers shooting other drug dealers. We've had what?
[53:26.800 --> 53:32.960]  Three real mass shootings where somebody went in to kill a bunch of people. And in one case,
[53:32.960 --> 53:38.080]  the cops stopped him by the time he'd already shot just one person. So our prayers go out to
[53:38.080 --> 53:44.080]  everybody. Let's continue to be vigilant. It's now time to arm the teachers. It's now time to
[53:45.120 --> 53:47.120]  not have these places be victim to some of its own.
[53:49.600 --> 53:55.120]  I witness described shooter with a sawed off shotgun at Texas High School.
[53:55.120 --> 54:00.400]  Well, that'll be the first time they didn't use an AR 15 at the media advertisers go shoot schools.
[54:00.400 --> 54:04.880]  It's what you do if you're crazy. They're always on prozac. We'll see if this guy's on a prozac type
[54:04.880 --> 54:10.560]  drug. But here's some of the scanner audio from just minutes into it happening, where the few
[54:10.560 --> 54:14.400]  police that were there went in and were calling for backup, looking like they had a pretty good
[54:14.400 --> 54:19.440]  response time, unlike Parkland where they stood down. Here it is. A little bit more about what
[54:19.440 --> 54:26.400]  took place this morning. San Jose PD three question mutilated off shooting at the high school.
[54:26.400 --> 54:29.440]  I'm 31. We'll make an entry for that.
[54:31.440 --> 54:37.440]  City Dickens and the medic one need you to say for shooting at Santa Fe school 1600 highway
[54:37.440 --> 54:41.440]  six and each of the states per Santa Fe shooting at the school.
[54:41.440 --> 54:51.440]  Okay, so you're listening.
[54:51.440 --> 54:53.440]  Shots fired additional shots fired.
[54:55.440 --> 55:01.440]  We'll go ahead and get several shots fired possibly one or two rooms in this area that we're at.
[55:03.440 --> 55:05.440]  Still have several more shots.
[55:05.440 --> 55:11.440]  We're coming out the front doors.
[55:13.440 --> 55:19.440]  He got three shooting. He's in the art room. We've got shots fired right now guys.
[55:27.440 --> 55:34.440]  Of course, this is from the 911 tapes and the dispatch is recordings of the news grab and they show footage later after
[55:34.440 --> 55:40.440]  with the police milling around. That was not during the shooting. The police weren't milling around during the shooting.
[55:40.440 --> 55:42.440]  We're gonna come back and play more of this.
[55:42.440 --> 55:48.440]  Remember, communists have killed over 100 million people. Fascists have killed more than 40 million people.
[55:48.440 --> 55:54.440]  Government's total 261 million people according to major university studies just in the 20th century.
[55:54.440 --> 56:00.440]  School shootings less than 60 a year still too many, but they're going to hype this and blame the American gun owner.
[56:00.440 --> 56:05.440]  That's why it's critical to get the facts out and say stop blaming us for what deranged people do.
[56:05.440 --> 56:10.440]  And the fact that the media hypes up these schools as mass shooting centers separately.
[56:10.440 --> 56:18.440]  We're going to open the phones up here for folks that are in the town for people that have family in the school specifically.
[56:18.440 --> 56:29.440]  Here's the number 877-789 Alex 877-789-2539 877-789-2539 please don't forget.
[56:29.440 --> 56:34.440]  We're going to have Alan Schreuer and our crew on the ground there in the next few hours with live coverage as well.
[56:34.440 --> 56:40.440]  Please spread the live links on Twitter, Facebook, YouTube and to infowars.com of our live coverage.
[56:40.440 --> 56:48.440]  So we can counter the corporate media that's going to try to saddle the American people with this crime.
[56:48.440 --> 56:52.440]  That's authoritarianism when you say if your neighbor does something illegal you're to blame.
[56:52.440 --> 56:58.440]  Gun stop what 25 or 26 crimes for every crime they're used in.
[56:58.440 --> 57:02.440]  We know the fact it's good guys and good ladies that stop bad guys with guns.
[57:02.440 --> 57:05.440]  But they're still pushing, pushing, pushing saying never one more.
[57:05.440 --> 57:17.440]  We'll never one more car wreck, never one more miscarriage, never one more drowned child, never one more house fire, never one more stroke, never one more stabbing, never one more drug overdue.
[57:17.440 --> 57:21.440]  There's evil in the world. It's a spiritual and cultural issue.
[57:21.440 --> 57:26.440]  And because we have these bad deranged people and there is some societal breakdown happening mentally.
[57:26.440 --> 57:31.440]  We all need guns to protect ourselves. Our hearts and prayers go out to those that have been hurt.
[57:31.440 --> 57:36.440]  Whatever you do spread the live links infowars.com forward slash show.
[57:36.440 --> 57:42.440]  Let's get these articles out now's the time for maximum energy to get out front David Hogg and all these other people.

[58:08.440 --> 58:13.440]  CNN and many others are calling for info wars to be shut down taken off the web.
[58:13.440 --> 58:20.440]  Slate magazine has a professor and others saying go beyond censorship brainwash young people against info wars.
[58:20.440 --> 58:25.440]  Psychologically inoculate them with lies so they don't actually hear what we have to say.
[58:25.440 --> 58:28.440]  We are the most hated news source in the world by globalist.

[01:02:19.440 --> 01:02:27.440]  We're going to come back with Rodney eyewitness from Santa Fe says 150 children took shelter.
[01:02:27.440 --> 01:02:32.440]  So that is all unfolding right now.
[01:02:32.440 --> 01:02:43.440]  I want to go out to break here though with just a montage of Pelosi response to Trump's animal comments she knows full well it was about MS 13.
[01:02:43.440 --> 01:02:45.440]  So she's saying that they're God's children.
[01:02:45.440 --> 01:02:48.440]  I guess she means this man shooters OK to.
[01:02:48.440 --> 01:02:54.440]  And then we've also got Trump saying I will always refer to MS 13 as animals.
[01:02:54.440 --> 01:02:57.440]  Here are the clips.
[01:02:57.440 --> 01:03:05.440]  Some of us who are attracted to the political arena to government and public service that we're all God's children.
[01:03:05.440 --> 01:03:15.440]  There's a spark of divinity in every person on earth and that we all have to recognize that as we respect the dignity and worth of every person.
[01:03:15.440 --> 01:03:21.440]  And as we recognize our responsibilities with that spark of divinity within us.
[01:03:21.440 --> 01:03:28.440]  And so when the president of the United States says about undocumented immigrants these aren't people.
[01:03:28.440 --> 01:03:31.440]  These are animals.
[01:03:31.440 --> 01:03:39.440]  You have to wonder does he not believe in the spark of divinity the dignity and worth of every person.
[01:03:39.440 --> 01:03:41.440]  These are not people.
[01:03:41.440 --> 01:03:43.440]  These are animals.
[01:03:43.440 --> 01:03:46.440]  The president of the United States.
[01:03:46.440 --> 01:03:55.440]  Every day that you think you've seen it all along comes another manifestation of why their policies are so inhumane.
[01:03:55.440 --> 01:04:05.440]  And why we have to continue to debate striving for bipartisanship with openness about what is what is at stake and what the choices are.
[01:04:05.440 --> 01:04:11.440]  And to be unifying in every way possible calling people animals is not a good thing.
[01:04:11.440 --> 01:04:12.440]  Thank you.
[01:04:12.440 --> 01:04:14.440]  Bye bye.
[01:04:14.440 --> 01:04:20.440]  Can you clarify the context of your use of the word animal yesterday referring to some people?
[01:04:20.440 --> 01:04:27.440]  Well it has nothing to do with this meeting but I'm referring and you know I'm referring to the MS-13 gangs that are coming in.
[01:04:27.440 --> 01:04:33.440]  And I was talking about the MS-13 and also if you look a little bit further on in the tape you'll see that.
[01:04:33.440 --> 01:04:37.440]  So I'm actually surprised you're asking this question because most people got it right.
[01:04:37.440 --> 01:04:40.440]  But I'm saying the MS-13 you don't have that where you come from.
[01:04:40.440 --> 01:04:42.440]  MS-13 these are animals.
[01:04:42.440 --> 01:04:44.440]  They're coming into our country, we're getting them out.
[01:04:44.440 --> 01:04:46.440]  They come in again, we're getting them out.
[01:04:46.440 --> 01:04:49.440]  We need strong immigration laws.
[01:04:49.440 --> 01:04:51.440]  We have the weakest laws in the entire world.
[01:04:51.440 --> 01:05:16.440]  We have laws that are left out on immigration.
[01:05:16.440 --> 01:05:24.440]  We are funding the revolution. I mean I cannot say it any clearer and so it is essential that you purchase the products at InfoWarsStore.com.

[01:05:50.440 --> 01:06:16.440]  And that's who they are and they know we know who they are and they're coming back against us so we need your support.
[01:06:16.440 --> 01:06:22.440]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Commence Center in the heart of the Resistance.
[01:06:22.440 --> 01:06:25.440]  It's Alex Jones.
[01:06:25.440 --> 01:06:28.440]  Well the mass shooting just started three hours ago.
[01:06:28.440 --> 01:06:31.440]  An hour into it we didn't know if anybody was even hurt.
[01:06:31.440 --> 01:06:32.440]  Fox News didn't know.
[01:06:32.440 --> 01:06:35.440]  The president said, wow, you know, looks bad.
[01:06:35.440 --> 01:06:37.440]  School shooting in Texas, early reports not looking good.
[01:06:37.440 --> 01:06:38.440]  God bless.
[01:06:38.440 --> 01:06:44.440]  The anti-gun groups from Parkland funded by Soros are now slamming the president as being insensitive.
[01:06:44.440 --> 01:06:46.440]  It's just incredible.
[01:06:46.440 --> 01:06:48.440]  They're already blaming gun owners.
[01:06:48.440 --> 01:06:54.440]  They're already tweeting that we collectively are to blame that the Second Amendment must be repealed.
[01:06:54.440 --> 01:06:56.440]  Incredible.
[01:06:56.440 --> 01:07:07.440]  We have 10 dead, the reported student who's still alive burst into the art studio area and screams surprise before spraying bullets at people.
[01:07:07.440 --> 01:07:17.440]  Now remember, we have 56 people a year on average, between 46 and 56, it varies each year, but not above 60 people a year that die in mass shootings.
[01:07:17.440 --> 01:07:24.440]  And it's still too many, but thousands die in their backyard pools, thousands on jet skis, thousands falling down their bathrooms.
[01:07:24.440 --> 01:07:27.440]  But they hype it up and they blame gun owners.
[01:07:27.440 --> 01:07:31.440]  But listen, it's still way too many to have one dead student from guns.
[01:07:31.440 --> 01:07:39.440]  And the answer is what the president, what Ted Nugent and what Wayne Lompier and what other great patriots like Oliver North have called for,
[01:07:39.440 --> 01:07:40.440]  arming the teachers.
[01:07:40.440 --> 01:07:46.440]  We're in a race to do this as the MSM advertises schools where every deranged killer should go.
[01:07:46.440 --> 01:07:55.440]  And we have Ted Nugent joining us with his live expert analysis, the Motor City madman, obviously, an NRA board member.
[01:07:55.440 --> 01:07:58.440]  Thank you for coming on Ted Nugent from TedNugent.com.
[01:07:58.440 --> 01:08:04.440]  Well, thanks, Alex. Yeah, I appreciate the opportunity to speak a little bit of truth, logic and common sense.
[01:08:04.440 --> 01:08:09.440]  And of course, we are not going to stop praying for the families and the victims.
[01:08:09.440 --> 01:08:11.440]  We are not going to stop praying for America.
[01:08:11.440 --> 01:08:16.440]  We will not stop giving our thoughts and prayers for victims of such evil.
[01:08:16.440 --> 01:08:22.440]  As the left would like us to do as they scramble to worry about hardware and tools and weapons.
[01:08:22.440 --> 01:08:28.440]  When you came out here, we showed that a shotgun is far more deadly than an AR-15.
[01:08:28.440 --> 01:08:34.440]  And based on upcoming reports that I will review and I will share with you as soon as possible,
[01:08:34.440 --> 01:08:40.440]  we'll find out what the cadence of fire, what the actual firepower was, what the movement of the perpetrator and the victims were.
[01:08:40.440 --> 01:08:43.440]  But once again, this is not about hardware.
[01:08:43.440 --> 01:08:45.440]  It's about hardware.
[01:08:45.440 --> 01:08:46.440]  It's about spirit.
[01:08:46.440 --> 01:08:53.440]  This is a manifestation of a cultural deprivation and the abandonment of accountability and discipline in our world,
[01:08:53.440 --> 01:08:59.440]  where it goes right to the heart of what Nancy Pelosi and I painfully witnessed.
[01:08:59.440 --> 01:09:12.440]  Juan Williams on Fox tried to explain how calling murderers, torturers and rapists of MS-13 animals was not proper, was hurtful.
[01:09:12.440 --> 01:09:19.440]  When you can have a segment of society like Nancy Pelosi and Juan Williams and so many on the left held it,
[01:09:19.440 --> 01:09:29.440]  there were headlines that we were insensitive and we were cruel and hateful for calling rapists of MS-13 animals.
[01:09:29.440 --> 01:09:32.440]  I mean, you can't begin to explain this stuff, Alex.
[01:09:32.440 --> 01:09:36.440]  So I know that truth, logic and common sense still propels a quality of life.
[01:09:36.440 --> 01:09:43.440]  In my family, the Nugent family are independent. We carry guns. We have fire extinguishers. We have spare tires in all our vehicles.
[01:09:43.440 --> 01:09:53.440]  And if we want to stop the slaughter of innocents, one armed security guard for 1,400 students will not cut it.
[01:09:53.440 --> 01:09:56.440]  Somebody write that down.
[01:09:56.440 --> 01:10:04.440]  You have got to have armed security at our schools like we do banks in the airport and at sporting events and race tracks.
[01:10:04.440 --> 01:10:16.440]  We have to have an armed, prepared, trained security individual, preferably undercover without a uniform on, at every entrance of every school in America.
[01:10:16.440 --> 01:10:23.440]  Now, I can just hear the hate and victory all coming my way because I'm recommending more guns when in fact the statistics are inescapable.
[01:10:23.440 --> 01:10:29.440]  I happen to know you can get off-duty police officers bonded, certified for $25 an hour.
[01:10:29.440 --> 01:10:36.440]  This is very inexpensive. It needs to happen now. The left has advertised schools for lunatics to go kill people.
[01:10:36.440 --> 01:10:45.440]  And not only that, and God bless those that pursue professional training, but I know janitors and I know coaches. I know teachers.
[01:10:45.440 --> 01:10:48.440]  I know administrators in schools across this country.
[01:10:48.440 --> 01:10:57.440]  See, a lot of people don't know that the Motor City Madman was named father of the year at my children's school because I was in school with my children.
[01:10:57.440 --> 01:11:01.440]  And I was armed every time I was in the school with my children.
[01:11:01.440 --> 01:11:16.440]  And I would do Father's Day presentations and wildlife education scenarios and the discipline of marksmanship and archery and talk to the kids about how important, critical, clean and sober is to have the American dream.
[01:11:16.440 --> 01:11:30.440]  But I know there are parents and teachers and administrators and janitors and coaches out there that not only are ready, willing and able to be armed to stop evil perpetrators, but they already have concealed weapons permits,
[01:11:30.440 --> 01:11:40.440]  but they're invalid in those arenas where they're the most desperately needed. Alex, you can't begin to explain this stuff.
[01:11:40.440 --> 01:11:54.440]  We can continue to go on and on and on. And once again, we proved that it doesn't take an AR-15 and that it's not an assault weapon and if you use a van or if you use a machete or a hatchet in London,
[01:11:54.440 --> 01:12:09.440]  or you use a renaissance car in Manhattan, you can kill whoever you want to kill when people are either comfortably numb or much too relaxed and they abandon that level of awareness that is imperative for survival.
[01:12:09.440 --> 01:12:20.440]  I'm called a radical because I actually pursue a higher level of awareness and situational awareness and I have the proper tools at hand from fire extinguishers to spare tires to handguns and ammo.
[01:12:20.440 --> 01:12:34.440]  I'm called the weirdo as all the real insane people like Juan Williams and Nancy Pelosi condemn us calling MS-13 rapist murders and torturers animals. You can't get more bizarre than this.
[01:12:34.440 --> 01:12:43.440]  That's right. Ted Nugent's our guest and I've got coming up. Dale is an eyewitness, says that his son knows the suspect. We've got Rodney eyewitness.
[01:12:43.440 --> 01:12:51.440]  So they're coming up a few minutes left with Ted Nugent as we learn more as this unfolds. We'll hopefully get him back perhaps tomorrow or later this afternoon.
[01:12:51.440 --> 01:12:57.440]  But just looking at the Pelosi clip I played earlier, you're obviously aware of it. I saw Juan Williams this morning on Fox.
[01:12:57.440 --> 01:13:09.440]  You must have been watching the same show I was saying how dare Trump dehumanize all God's children. Then Pelosi said MS-13 have a spark of divinity.
[01:13:09.440 --> 01:13:26.440]  Close quote. This is next level. I was told by law enforcement and CIA people that the Democrats actually use MS-13 as muscle for them in their big blue city areas they control and that that's why they're so mad at Trump that he's rolling up MS-13.
[01:13:26.440 --> 01:13:36.440]  Well, it really is a divided nation. I just finished a documentary with a gentleman by the name of Steve West that I'll send you the link to what's coming out in major release here in the next month or so.
[01:13:36.440 --> 01:13:52.440]  It's about a divided America where you're damn right we're divided. Those of us that would condemn the MS-13 rapists and murderers and torturers, those of us that would condemn evil and that on one side and then the Nancy Pelosi and the Juan Williams and the New York Times and the MSNBC
[01:13:52.440 --> 01:14:06.440]  and the Liberal Democrats on the other side where they actually think that MS-13 has a spark of divinity. I'm telling you, I wrote Wango Tango which is the funniest, most fun song in the world.
[01:14:06.440 --> 01:14:15.440]  But I'm going to write a song about how liberals think that rapists have a spark of divinity. This is so horrific that if you don't laugh you'll cry.
[01:14:15.440 --> 01:14:25.440]  I can't even believe it. But it shows just like the liberals sided with the Arab Spring overthrowing non-radical Muslims. I mean they just have gone pure evil.
[01:14:25.440 --> 01:14:34.440]  But like you said, the Democrats have been evil for a long time but they're really showing their teeth. I know you've been pushing for initiatives to have select people like President Trump's called for.
[01:14:34.440 --> 01:14:44.440]  You've been quarterbacking that at the NRA, get select trained people in the schools armed for no additional cost. That would make these soft targets hard targets, wouldn't they?
[01:14:44.440 --> 01:14:54.440]  Well, we've proven it just in Illinois, just this last week there was an armed individual in our security guard. I don't know if he was uniformed or not, doesn't matter at this point.
[01:14:54.440 --> 01:15:05.440]  But he engaged an active shooter and number of deaths, Alex, zero. So it's not like you and I have a hunch. It's not like we have a wild guess.
[01:15:05.440 --> 01:15:17.440]  It's not like we're pulling this out of our ass. The evidence is irrefutable. If you are unarmed and helpless, you are unarmed and helpless.
[01:15:17.440 --> 01:15:27.440]  What a tragic, irresponsible, embarrassing condition to allow yourself to become. And all I'm saying is that I'm just a guitar player.
[01:15:27.440 --> 01:15:32.440]  But I've never been without a pocket knife and a handkerchief and a pistol.
[01:15:32.440 --> 01:15:41.440]  They want to domesticate you. Ted Nugent, I know you've got to go. This is a three minute break. I want to just come back with two, three more minutes with you to ask you where you think the gun grabbers are going.
[01:15:41.440 --> 01:15:46.440]  Where we need to go to stop them because you know they're going to come even more now for the repeal of the Second Amendment.
[01:15:46.440 --> 01:15:57.440]  So I want to get an update from you on that fight and then we'll let you go. And we've got eyewitnesses from the shooting right after that. Dale and Rodney, please stay right there.
[01:15:57.440 --> 01:16:02.440]  Fellow Patriots, my name is Todd Savage, founder of Black Rifle Real Estate dot com.

[01:20:09.440 --> 01:20:25.440]  All right, Dale says his son knows the suspect and Rodney is an eyewitness.
[01:20:25.440 --> 01:20:33.440]  We have a lot of obviously listeners in Texas with every tragic event, fortunately but also unfortunately we have people right there on the ground.
[01:20:33.440 --> 01:20:40.440]  And we had two students on and three different newscasts all reporting a stand down in Florida.
[01:20:40.440 --> 01:20:48.440]  And now we know on top of that that Cruz was on psychotropic, protected for years, part of a promise program that let him out of jail.
[01:20:48.440 --> 01:20:53.440]  And we're talking burglary, reportedly vandalism.
[01:20:53.440 --> 01:20:56.440]  He was known as the school shooter, threatening to kill people.
[01:20:56.440 --> 01:21:03.440]  But he was protected by Coward County, now the chief deputy that was over this and stood down that day.
[01:21:03.440 --> 01:21:07.440]  He gets $8,700 a month till he dies.
[01:21:07.440 --> 01:21:12.440]  And Ted Nugent in closing, I really appreciate your time, NRA board member.
[01:21:12.440 --> 01:21:15.440]  You nailed it earlier, you elaborate on that.
[01:21:15.440 --> 01:21:18.440]  This isn't a hardware issue, a machete, a truck, a gun.
[01:21:18.440 --> 01:21:21.440]  This is an issue of sick, twisted freaks.
[01:21:21.440 --> 01:21:31.440]  And it's so obvious and I'm not going to take the blame. I know you're not as gun owners with the millions of crimes that get stopped every year by law abiding citizens.
[01:21:31.440 --> 01:21:36.440]  I'm not or the woman in Brazil shooting the guy that's trying to kidnap the kids.
[01:21:36.440 --> 01:21:40.440]  You know, that footage from last week, this stuff never gets picked up by the media.
[01:21:40.440 --> 01:21:43.440]  But these tragic events get magnified and then blamed on us.
[01:21:43.440 --> 01:21:47.440]  If my neighbor runs over their wife with a truck, that's not my fault.
[01:21:47.440 --> 01:21:49.440]  I don't get blamed for that.
[01:21:49.440 --> 01:21:55.440]  People would get mad if a guy down the road, let's say, killed his wife with a guillotine, God forbid.
[01:21:55.440 --> 01:22:02.440]  If they came to your door and said, Mr. Nugent, you're to blame because Bill two miles away killed his wife, you'd laugh at him.
[01:22:02.440 --> 01:22:07.440]  But why don't we get more angry when they blame us for something that has nothing to do with us?
[01:22:07.440 --> 01:22:18.440]  Well, it's fascinating because after the Parkland students abandoned their grieving and their heartfelt emotion after witnessing such a tragedy there,
[01:22:18.440 --> 01:22:23.440]  they turned to hate because I termed them as mushy-brained teenagers,
[01:22:23.440 --> 01:22:27.440]  which I think Alex, we're all mushy-brained teenagers when we're that young.
[01:22:27.440 --> 01:22:29.440]  We're still absorbing it and we don't know much.
[01:22:29.440 --> 01:22:32.440]  That wasn't a mean statement. That wasn't an attack.
[01:22:32.440 --> 01:22:42.440]  Just like when the president called MS-13 animals and then the left finds fault with calling rapists animals.
[01:22:42.440 --> 01:22:47.440]  So you can't make sense out of the left propaganda ministry.
[01:22:47.440 --> 01:22:52.440]  Well, exactly. By the way, animals isn't enough. How about monsters? How about scum?
[01:22:52.440 --> 01:22:58.440]  They're pure devils. They're just pure evil. But I just tweeted, I got my band here. I'm rehearsing.
[01:22:58.440 --> 01:23:03.440]  I've got a killer gig right here in Waco, Texas at Tucker Hall on the 26th.
[01:23:03.440 --> 01:23:08.440]  The whole Nugent band is here and we're barbecuing and we're shooting guns and they're going to be surrounded.
[01:23:08.440 --> 01:23:13.440]  It's right in Waco, Texas at Tucker Hall and you're going to find the greatest people in the world.
[01:23:13.440 --> 01:23:20.440]  They're all genuine asset column Americans and they're all gun people and they all agree with the things that I'm saying right now.
[01:23:20.440 --> 01:23:29.440]  This is what I tweeted. Guns are more restricted than ever, but liberal feel-good abandonment of accountability and discipline rages on.
[01:23:29.440 --> 01:23:39.440]  Let me repeat that. Guns are more restricted than ever, but liberal feel-good abandonment of accountability and discipline rages on.
[01:23:39.440 --> 01:23:47.440]  In every instance, Alex, these murderers have been known to be psychotic, to be dangerous, to be threatening.
[01:23:47.440 --> 01:24:01.440]  In every instance, from Columbine to Virginia Tech to Luby's cafeteria to San Bernardino and the Pace nightclub in Orlando and in Parkland,
[01:24:01.440 --> 01:24:11.440]  every time the murders were known to be absolutely dangerous, I predict, and it really doesn't matter what the prediction is true or not,
[01:24:11.440 --> 01:24:19.440]  but I predict that this maniac, this evil, evil person that slaughtered innocent people today in Santa Fe, Texas,
[01:24:19.440 --> 01:24:29.440]  he will be discovered to be a known crazy person that in a feel-good liberal world, you don't identify a crazy person
[01:24:29.440 --> 01:24:33.440]  because you might hurt his feelings, and this is the result.
[01:24:33.440 --> 01:24:38.440]  Every time they're on a prozec type drug, every time they're being protected, every time there's a stand-down,
[01:24:38.440 --> 01:24:45.440]  and you know, we think of Texas as red, Houston's blue now, a lot of great people, and that area down in Galveston is now blue,
[01:24:45.440 --> 01:24:49.440]  and it's just weird that this seems to always happen in a blue area, Ted Nugent.
[01:24:49.440 --> 01:24:57.440]  Well, the uniform crime report by the Federal Bureau of Investigation, not to be confused with the gangsters like Comey
[01:24:57.440 --> 01:25:03.440]  and the thugs that run the FBI, how long would you enter a building that says,
[01:25:03.440 --> 01:25:08.440]  J. Edgar Hoover over the entrance without feeling guilty and want to change the status quo?
[01:25:08.440 --> 01:25:09.440]  But I digress.
[01:25:09.440 --> 01:25:16.440]  But the crime report from the FBI has proven that in every highest crime zone in America,
[01:25:16.440 --> 01:25:24.440]  you could map up America, it's almost all red, except for little blue, high crime Democrat smudges.
[01:25:24.440 --> 01:25:32.440]  Democrats and liberals are more dedicated to make you feel good than actually doing good,
[01:25:32.440 --> 01:25:42.440]  and it manifested itself today in Santa Fe, Texas, and what Nancy Pelosi and Juan Williams attempted to legitimize MS-13
[01:25:42.440 --> 01:25:45.440]  by condemning those of us that would call them animals.
[01:25:45.440 --> 01:25:51.440]  I mean, Rod Serling wouldn't produce a Twilight Zone episode.
[01:25:51.440 --> 01:25:54.440]  Mad Magazine wouldn't run this story.
[01:25:54.440 --> 01:25:55.440]  It's so stupid.
[01:25:55.440 --> 01:26:01.440]  But this new, I'm going to send you a copy and a link to this new Division of America documentary.
[01:26:01.440 --> 01:26:02.440]  I want to see it.
[01:26:02.440 --> 01:26:03.440]  And you know what?
[01:26:03.440 --> 01:26:05.440]  I think I may bring the family up to that great concert you're putting on.
[01:26:05.440 --> 01:26:07.440]  Ted Nugent, say hi to Shamay.
[01:26:07.440 --> 01:26:08.440]  Thank you so much for all you do.
[01:26:08.440 --> 01:26:09.440]  You bet.
[01:26:09.440 --> 01:26:11.440]  We're praying for the families down in Santa Fe, Alex.
[01:26:11.440 --> 01:26:12.440]  Absolutely.
[01:26:12.440 --> 01:26:13.440]  Pray for them.
[01:26:13.440 --> 01:26:14.440]  God bless you.
[01:26:14.440 --> 01:26:15.440]  Thank you, Ted Nugent.
[01:26:15.440 --> 01:26:16.440]  All right.
[01:26:16.440 --> 01:26:18.440]  There goes Ted Nugent, and I'm going to call him back today.
[01:26:18.440 --> 01:26:22.440]  I'll probably pop back on the other broadcasts we have with Owen Schreuer is going to be in the field.
[01:26:22.440 --> 01:26:25.440]  Now, I apologize to Dale, and I apologize to Rodney.
[01:26:25.440 --> 01:26:26.440]  I was going to go right to you.
[01:26:26.440 --> 01:26:27.440]  I sent Ted a text.
[01:26:27.440 --> 01:26:29.440]  I said, hey, can you come on the next few hours?
[01:26:29.440 --> 01:26:30.440]  And boom, he called the hotline.
[01:26:30.440 --> 01:26:31.440]  He's a man of action.
[01:26:31.440 --> 01:26:33.440]  So I was like, okay, we'll have Ted up front.
[01:26:33.440 --> 01:26:34.440]  Obviously, you know why.
[01:26:34.440 --> 01:26:41.440]  So we're going to now go to Dale, who says that he is an eyewitness down in Santa Fe.
[01:26:41.440 --> 01:26:44.440]  We're at least 10 or dead praying for those.
[01:26:44.440 --> 01:26:47.440]  Obviously, lost people praying for those, fighting for their lives.
[01:26:47.440 --> 01:26:48.440]  This is a real tragic event.
[01:26:48.440 --> 01:26:52.440]  He says his son knows the suspect, and then we'll go to Rodney after that.
[01:26:52.440 --> 01:26:53.440]  Dale, thanks for holding.
[01:26:53.440 --> 01:26:54.440]  Go ahead.
[01:26:54.440 --> 01:26:55.440]  Yes, sir.
[01:26:55.440 --> 01:26:56.440]  How are you doing, Alex?
[01:26:56.440 --> 01:27:01.440]  I'm a longtime listener, a first-time caller, second amendment supporter.
[01:27:01.440 --> 01:27:09.440]  I have a sophomore that attends Santa Fe High School at approximately five minutes to eight
[01:27:09.440 --> 01:27:10.440]  this morning.
[01:27:10.440 --> 01:27:15.440]  He called me out of breath, telling me that there was a shooter at the school, at the high
[01:27:15.440 --> 01:27:23.440]  school, and that he was running down the road to the gas station that's just south of the
[01:27:23.440 --> 01:27:25.440]  school, about a click.
[01:27:25.440 --> 01:27:32.440]  And so he told me that the fire alarm went off and they all went out of the rooms.
[01:27:32.440 --> 01:27:38.440]  They heard what they thought could have been gunshots, but then they heard two loud gunshots
[01:27:38.440 --> 01:27:40.440]  and everybody started running.
[01:27:40.440 --> 01:27:48.440]  And so he has a brother, too, that eventually met up with him there at the service station.
[01:27:48.440 --> 01:27:55.040]  And I picked him up about a mile off the highway, a mile south of the school, off the highway
[01:27:55.040 --> 01:27:58.840]  when I left work to run over and pick him up.
[01:27:58.840 --> 01:28:11.440]  And we were watching a report on CBS where the shooter was named by someone who had seen,
[01:28:11.440 --> 01:28:16.640]  been a witness to, Dmitry, I don't want to use his last name.
[01:28:16.640 --> 01:28:20.840]  I guess everybody deserves some anonymity, especially minors.
[01:28:20.840 --> 01:28:23.840]  But you're saying CBS said the name?
[01:28:23.840 --> 01:28:26.840]  CBS said the name.
[01:28:26.840 --> 01:28:27.840]  Yeah.
[01:28:27.840 --> 01:28:32.840]  And this person named Dmitry and said he was in a trench coat.
[01:28:32.840 --> 01:28:39.840]  And my son said at the house after I'd evacuated him said, I know Dmitry.
[01:28:39.840 --> 01:28:42.840]  He's always talking about guns and knives.
[01:28:42.840 --> 01:28:48.840]  And who wears the trench coat all the time into apparently his MO.
[01:28:48.840 --> 01:28:50.840]  It's the trench coat mafia devil or some stuff.
[01:28:50.840 --> 01:28:51.840]  Stay there, sir.
[01:28:51.840 --> 01:28:52.840]  This is critical.
[01:28:52.840 --> 01:28:53.840]  This is absolutely critical.
[01:28:53.840 --> 01:28:54.840]  We'll be right back.
[01:28:54.840 --> 01:28:56.840]  Let me talk to you during the break.
[01:28:56.840 --> 01:28:57.840]  Hello, patriots.

[01:29:02.840 --> 01:29:06.840]  Like you, I was a prisoner of the out left sanctuary state until one day I chose to lead
[01:29:06.840 --> 01:29:07.840]  my family to freedom.
[01:29:07.840 --> 01:29:12.840]  Today, we live on a sustainable 20 acre homestead where we shoot, hunt, garden and homeschool
[01:29:12.840 --> 01:29:15.840]  our children without the tyranny of the nanny state looking over us.

[01:31:57.240 --> 01:32:02.280]  We've taken thousands of years of known research and put it together with our own four years
[01:32:02.280 --> 01:32:07.000]  of seeking and testing to find the very best systems that God gave us through Mother Nature
[01:32:07.000 --> 01:32:12.680]  to detoxify the body. That's why I'm introducing Z-Shield, Toxic Metal and Chemical Defense
[01:32:12.680 --> 01:32:18.520]  support. It's made in the USA. It's filled with known compounds from nature that are absolutely
[01:32:18.520 --> 01:32:23.240]  associated with detoxifying the body and it supports the InfoWars. It is a classical 360
[01:32:23.240 --> 01:32:28.280]  win. This is the formula that I personally have been taking for over a year and now we believe
[01:32:28.280 --> 01:32:33.240]  we have come as close to perfection when it comes to a detoxifier as you can possibly get.

[01:32:52.280 --> 01:33:08.200]  we're changing the world. Now it's time to change our bodies with Z-Shield InfoWarsLive.com.
[01:33:08.200 --> 01:33:24.120]  The Alex Jones Show. Because there is a war on for your mind.
[01:33:27.720 --> 01:33:33.400]  My friend got shot in the art hole and as soon as the alarms went off, everybody just started
[01:33:33.400 --> 01:33:40.040]  running outside and the next thing you know, everybody looks and you hear boom, boom, boom and
[01:33:40.040 --> 01:33:46.280]  I just ran as fast as I could to the nearest forest so I could hide and I called my mom.
[01:33:48.680 --> 01:33:54.920]  Now we have Dale and Rodney and others that are eyewitnesses who live there in the town.
[01:33:55.640 --> 01:34:01.080]  This gentleman rescued his sons about a, he said a half mile or mile away from the school.
[01:34:01.080 --> 01:34:09.400]  He said, off air to us, the name of the supposed shooter, the reported shooter and now the Metro,
[01:34:09.400 --> 01:34:14.360]  one of the big papers in London, has photos of who they purport to be.
[01:34:16.360 --> 01:34:24.200]  This individual, he has a Greek class name, Demetrius Pagoritus. I'm pronouncing that correctly.
[01:34:24.200 --> 01:34:32.760]  It's phonetically broken down later in the article but part of that is broken as well.
[01:34:32.760 --> 01:34:40.600]  Demetrius Pagortis and he liked to wear t-shirts like Born to Kill
[01:34:43.080 --> 01:34:47.160]  and it looks like he was into Satanism as I predicted.
[01:34:48.600 --> 01:34:51.880]  Can you guys just give me a document cam shot on my, my article and we'll go back to the witness
[01:34:51.880 --> 01:34:56.840]  because it has it right here. He has an octopus which is a sign of international
[01:34:56.840 --> 01:35:08.200]  evil and conspiracy, a pentagram, a pocket watch and an iron cross.
[01:35:10.520 --> 01:35:17.960]  There is a communist star so it looked like he was into evil and that's what I noticed
[01:35:17.960 --> 01:35:26.840]  even though the shooters at Columbine were Jewish, at least one of them was Jewish,
[01:35:26.840 --> 01:35:30.760]  the other purported to be part Jewish, they were into Nazism because devil worshippers
[01:35:30.760 --> 01:35:35.480]  are just into whatever's evil and I predicted in the last hour that they'd probably be a
[01:35:35.480 --> 01:35:41.800]  devil worshipper on Prozac type drugs because almost every time they are, this is incredible.
[01:35:43.000 --> 01:35:46.840]  Now the father who we were just talking to said that he talked to his son
[01:35:46.840 --> 01:35:53.160]  and that that basically, that the name did check out. So this is preliminary, we're breaking this
[01:35:53.160 --> 01:35:58.840]  down live ladies and gentlemen. What happens in mainstream media is I'll cover what another paper
[01:35:58.840 --> 01:36:04.680]  covers. People won't sue that paper, they'll sue me if it's not 100% accurate. So we're reporting
[01:36:04.680 --> 01:36:12.840]  on what the Metro is reporting on and going right to Dale who picked up his sons who survived
[01:36:12.840 --> 01:36:18.360]  this tragic event that's killed at least 10 people. So Dale please continue, recap and then
[01:36:18.360 --> 01:36:24.200]  you can say the guy's full name now because it's in the news and walk through. Is this accurate?
[01:36:25.320 --> 01:36:31.640]  What the Metro was saying, please continue. Yes, it was about a five minutes to eight when my
[01:36:31.640 --> 01:36:37.880]  son called me out of breath. He told me that there was an active shooter at the school and that
[01:36:37.880 --> 01:36:43.800]  they let him out and the fire alarm went off and they let the kids out of class.
[01:36:44.440 --> 01:36:50.440]  And as they were walking, they heard some loud noises, but then they heard two distinct noises.
[01:36:50.440 --> 01:36:56.360]  Bang, bang. And they took off running and they did exactly what I told them to do. If anything
[01:36:56.360 --> 01:37:00.440]  ever happens at your school, you run away from the school, don't stay at the school,
[01:37:00.440 --> 01:37:04.920]  huddle up, don't do none of that. You get away. You're a good daddy. That's what I've told my
[01:37:04.920 --> 01:37:10.600]  children is you run, you run, you zig, you zag. Somebody tries to kidnap you, grabs you by the
[01:37:10.600 --> 01:37:14.680]  arm, you start screaming, you run. You don't put your head between your legs in case you're asked
[01:37:14.680 --> 01:37:23.240]  goodbye. Absolutely. And so his freshman son, Gerald's my sophomore. He's the one that was,
[01:37:23.240 --> 01:37:30.280]  I'm talking about there and his freshman sophomore James, brother James, met up with him at the
[01:37:30.280 --> 01:37:36.440]  store later. So they both followed dad's instructions. Well, good. I can tell your happy daddy. Well,
[01:37:36.440 --> 01:37:41.640]  you were telling us off air that your son knows the suspect. Is this description by the metro
[01:37:41.640 --> 01:37:45.960]  of somebody wearing black trench coats, weird paraphernalia? Is that accurate?
[01:37:46.760 --> 01:37:52.360]  Yeah, that is accurate. It sounds like an, uh, I can't pronounce that last name, either Pogardus
[01:37:52.360 --> 01:37:58.680]  or something of that nature, but my son played, uh, if it's the same Dimitri, played football with
[01:37:58.680 --> 01:38:03.880]  them. And he was always interested in talking about guns and knives and that sort of thing.
[01:38:04.760 --> 01:38:13.720]  And, uh, he was shocked to hear that news. Uh, and so was I quite frankly. I've also got a wife,
[01:38:14.920 --> 01:38:22.280]  Lydia, who got a text from somebody whose husband's on the job and they're saying that 11 people are
[01:38:22.280 --> 01:38:30.680]  dead. At least one of them is a teacher. And so during this whole incident, uh, that's what, uh,
[01:38:30.680 --> 01:38:36.680]  that's what she sent it over to me and I've seen it too. So this is just terrible. I'm sad to hear
[01:38:36.680 --> 01:38:41.240]  that. You know, I, I predicted because in almost every case, it's the same. The devil worships
[01:38:41.240 --> 01:38:47.480]  involved. Uh, and there he is sickeningly wearing a peace symbol on his hat, which is actually the
[01:38:47.480 --> 01:38:52.440]  Germanic rune of death. If you actually know what it means, terrible. When the arms are up, it means
[01:38:52.440 --> 01:38:58.760]  a tree living. The arms are down. It's a dead tree. Uh, he also had pentagrams, uh, Satanism,
[01:38:58.760 --> 01:39:03.320]  according to his YouTube channels, according to Facebook channels. Uh, and they're saying this
[01:39:03.320 --> 01:39:10.200]  is confirmed to be his channel. So just really, really, really sick, uh, that yet again, it's
[01:39:10.200 --> 01:39:16.280]  evil satanic people that are causing the problems. And now other satanic people like George Soros,
[01:39:16.280 --> 01:39:22.760]  are going to try to use this to take our guns. That's terrible. You know, I'll tell you, this is, uh,
[01:39:22.760 --> 01:39:27.960]  this, you know, they can say it was unexpected, but I can tell you within the past two months,
[01:39:28.680 --> 01:39:36.040]  they had a false alarm active shooter drill at the school and then they had two more drills
[01:39:36.040 --> 01:39:43.160]  since that time within the past two months. And now it finally happens. And, uh, just last week,
[01:39:43.160 --> 01:39:51.720]  UTMB hospital, thank goodness, had a math casualty drill. So, uh, I don't know if any of that's
[01:39:51.720 --> 01:39:58.760]  connected, but it doesn't sound, you know, like it, uh, it doesn't sound too good to me, uh, being a
[01:39:58.760 --> 01:40:05.240]  listener. Absolutely. Well, let me tell you the, the inside scoop on this 2020, even in report on
[01:40:05.800 --> 01:40:12.520]  in 2002. In the mid 1990s, they started death education, suicide education,
[01:40:12.520 --> 01:40:15.880]  where they'd have the kids simulate getting in coffins. They teach them about death,
[01:40:15.880 --> 01:40:21.720]  how to commit suicide, so they wouldn't do it. But they found a tripling in suicides,
[01:40:21.720 --> 01:40:27.800]  particularly by young girls that get their shoelaces and go in the bathroom with the,
[01:40:27.800 --> 01:40:31.800]  with the coat rack hanger on the back of the stall and they'd hang themselves.
[01:40:32.760 --> 01:40:38.440]  That's why most schools stopped, uh, suicide prevention because if you teach little girls,
[01:40:38.440 --> 01:40:43.000]  don't cut yourselves. If you teach little girls, don't hang yourselves. Well, 13 year old girls
[01:40:43.000 --> 01:40:46.520]  weren't thinking about that to begin with, but now you introduce it in your mind. So,
[01:40:47.880 --> 01:40:51.560]  you have the media hyping mass shootings, you have them doing the shooting drills, just like
[01:40:51.560 --> 01:40:57.480]  Parkland had shooting drills the month before as well. It puts the idea into mentally ill people
[01:40:57.480 --> 01:41:02.840]  to do it. Now, I'm not saying you shouldn't still do it now. The ball's rolling, but this is how
[01:41:02.840 --> 01:41:09.320]  you introduce it with the media and the culture. Oh my gosh, just put it out there. Yep. And it
[01:41:09.320 --> 01:41:16.520]  causes the crazies to crack. I hear you. And so yeah, it's just the same. I mean, it's, uh,
[01:41:16.520 --> 01:41:25.160]  it's the same what they're doing to us. Um, so that's, uh, really all I had to report. Um,
[01:41:26.120 --> 01:41:30.360]  I just, uh, praying for everybody and ask everybody, all your listeners to pray for
[01:41:30.360 --> 01:41:37.320]  us and these families that lost their kids. I mean, I just can't imagine. It's horrific.
[01:41:37.320 --> 01:41:40.520]  Well, take the day. I totally agree with you. Take the daily beast. They even got it right
[01:41:40.520 --> 01:41:48.200]  and said, Nick Cruz, watch the drills and learn what to do. Oh my goodness. Yeah, teach them what
[01:41:48.200 --> 01:41:53.960]  to do. Well, they know if you go back to suicides in New York, off the Brooklyn bridge or off the
[01:41:53.960 --> 01:41:57.880]  Empire States building, they learn that when one person would jump, there'd be a big cluster
[01:41:57.880 --> 01:42:03.480]  after. And so you advertise to a bunch of kids on drugs, devil worshiping, playing shoot them up
[01:42:03.480 --> 01:42:07.640]  video games all day. Yeah. The average shoot them up game doesn't make you or I killer or our kids
[01:42:07.640 --> 01:42:12.600]  killers, but you take a mentally ill devil worshiper, they simulate killing all day.
[01:42:13.320 --> 01:42:20.120]  It's always the same video game, devil worshiper into Nazis, into devil worship, into communism,
[01:42:20.120 --> 01:42:24.680]  who's been refused by girls. And then they go and try to kill a bunch of people to show people
[01:42:24.680 --> 01:42:30.120]  how powerful they are. It's pure selfish satanism. What do you think of the reported dirtbag still
[01:42:30.120 --> 01:42:38.680]  being alive? Well, um, yeah, I was looking at that while they caught him alive. 11 other people are
[01:42:38.680 --> 01:42:45.800]  dead. Uh, that's, you know, I don't know. That's kind of unusual. Usually when the cops respond and
[01:42:45.800 --> 01:42:50.680]  and Santa Fe is a pretty close knit community. We have a lot of gun supporting. Hold on. I want

[01:46:57.320 --> 01:47:21.160]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show everybody knows that the days are loaded
[01:47:21.160 --> 01:47:28.840]  and everybody rolls with caffeine. So we've got Dale whose two sons survived and got away
[01:47:28.840 --> 01:47:34.360]  thinks that their dad's a directive them following that common sense directive instead of staying
[01:47:34.360 --> 01:47:37.880]  there and putting their heads between their legs like most schools tell you to do but looks like
[01:47:37.880 --> 01:47:41.400]  this school had the fire drill and opened the doors up and said get the hell out of here
[01:47:41.400 --> 01:47:45.960]  and it looks like the police responded very very quickly so this looks like this may not
[01:47:45.960 --> 01:47:50.680]  be the case like we saw with the stand down in Parkland or other areas or this death toll
[01:47:50.680 --> 01:47:56.520]  could have been a lot bigger. Obviously Dale we've got your number I'm going to give you our number
[01:47:57.400 --> 01:48:02.520]  if you can get your son to go talk to students that were eyewitnesses and get us more intel
[01:48:02.520 --> 01:48:07.240]  that would be absolutely vital and you know if you're a pro-gun of your sons are pro-gun you
[01:48:07.240 --> 01:48:11.000]  probably want to get to the media as well. Owen Schreuer is going to be down at the high school
[01:48:11.000 --> 01:48:15.480]  today because the the left's going to be there picking through these students and going through
[01:48:15.480 --> 01:48:22.280]  their Facebooks and trying to find who's anti-gun to let them speak for you and your young sons and
[01:48:22.280 --> 01:48:26.920]  for the victims as well so can you briefly speak to that then we'll go to Rodney.
[01:48:29.880 --> 01:48:37.240]  Dale we got to get over there and voice our opinion on about the Second Amendment issue
[01:48:37.240 --> 01:48:43.400]  that they're going to try to you know they're going to try to take it over like they do everything
[01:48:43.400 --> 01:48:53.240]  right and so yeah we'll get over there see if we can track down Owen and you know if he
[01:48:54.040 --> 01:49:00.200]  wants to come over for a good dinner that'll be fine with us so we're a tight-knit community
[01:49:00.200 --> 01:49:07.160]  tight-knit community in Santa Fe and as for the shooter still being alive I think that does speak
[01:49:07.160 --> 01:49:16.760]  volumes for the fairness that our cops and emergency respondent personnel have for
[01:49:17.960 --> 01:49:24.840]  following the law man I'll tell you what if I was a policeman and I would run rushed up on that scene
[01:49:24.840 --> 01:49:28.840]  I don't know if the kid would still be alive he might have got a bullet right between us
[01:49:28.840 --> 01:49:37.960]  that's just uh I'm just speaking from the heart oh I absolutely I'm exactly I I don't know how
[01:49:37.960 --> 01:49:41.800]  you see a bunch of dead kids and don't do it but they don't know there's somebody helping him
[01:49:41.800 --> 01:49:47.080]  so it's smart if they can take him alive to do that that's a lot of restraint by the police so
[01:49:47.080 --> 01:49:51.000]  absolutely all right well thank you so much we're going to put you on hold make sure we have your
[01:49:51.000 --> 01:49:54.120]  numbers I'm going to give your number to Owen I'm going to give you Owen's numbers God bless
[01:49:54.120 --> 01:50:00.440]  you Dale thanks for calling thank you God bless you Alex I bless you and Owen Troyer and some of
[01:50:00.440 --> 01:50:03.560]  our crew are gonna be down there in the next few hours so they're gonna be on the side of that wow
[01:50:04.600 --> 01:50:07.720]  that'd be powerful too to go to take those guys out to dinner we should take them out to dinner
[01:50:07.720 --> 01:50:11.800]  and interview them or something like that um if I want more reporters if I have more reporters
[01:50:11.800 --> 01:50:16.360]  that's one of our anchors we're sitting down there so they try to hire more crew uh but uh
[01:50:16.360 --> 01:50:20.520]  I'm not complaining it's just that I'd love to be a lot I'd be able I'd love to be able to do a lot
[01:50:20.520 --> 01:50:27.800]  more I would love to be able to do a lot more Rodney thanks for holding I really appreciate

[01:50:43.800 --> 01:50:49.640]  is directly across from the high school and his wife runs it too Lori is her name and I've
[01:50:49.640 --> 01:50:54.680]  known Lori for over 25 years her her her father and I grew up together we went to school here in
[01:50:54.680 --> 01:51:00.680]  Santa Fe and uh so what I what I what I know what when I talked to her father this morning
[01:51:00.680 --> 01:51:07.640]  is that Indian Automotive housed or or sheltered uh upwards to 150 people in that uh three car
[01:51:07.640 --> 01:51:13.240]  uh automotive shop that he has there so that might be somebody she want to talk to uh you
[01:51:13.240 --> 01:51:17.480]  know get to report her over and talk to him CBS News this morning was reporting about 10
[01:51:17.480 --> 01:51:22.280]  20 this morning was reporting an officer had been shot and that's what I'd like to speak to you
[01:51:22.280 --> 01:51:27.000]  because since I've been going to school now I've lived here since 1977 and Dale's right
[01:51:27.000 --> 01:51:33.640]  we're close to me I probably know Dale but we we've always had armed security at at the school
[01:51:33.640 --> 01:51:38.280]  since the since the 70s we've had armed security at our high school and our junior high school
[01:51:38.280 --> 01:51:44.840]  so I'm wondering if that report was accurate that the that the officer uh was shot that that was
[01:51:44.840 --> 01:51:48.920]  you know the armed officer that was taking care of security at that school I'm very curious about
[01:51:48.920 --> 01:51:55.960]  that uh as of about an hour ago highway six was shut off from 1764 going from Santa Fe
[01:51:55.960 --> 01:52:01.800]  towards the high school and and and Alvin going towards the high school on highway six so I don't
[01:52:01.800 --> 01:52:06.840]  know if it's if it's cleared about an hour about an hour maybe an hour and a half ago I was out there
[01:52:06.840 --> 01:52:10.600]  uh you know coming back home because I was I was gonna put my boat in the water tomorrow Alex I've
[01:52:10.600 --> 01:52:13.960]  been working on my boat for two months straight trying to get this stupid thing ready and then
[01:52:13.960 --> 01:52:18.120]  this happened so that's out the window I'm gonna spend the rest of the day praying and and fasting
[01:52:18.120 --> 01:52:22.840]  about this situation I don't know I think my next door neighbor's daughter she goes to that high
[01:52:22.840 --> 01:52:28.040]  school uh high school I think she's okay because he's not bouncing off the walls so I think everything's
[01:52:28.040 --> 01:52:33.800]  okay as far as that goes but um so I'm curious about but please Alex I'd like to say please
[01:52:33.800 --> 01:52:38.440]  make sure that the reporting is accurate because the last thing we knew this last thing we need is
[01:52:38.440 --> 01:52:44.680]  is you know uh speculation about what happened over when he left this thing play out the officers
[01:52:44.680 --> 01:52:50.920]  responded very well um and so you know Dale no no I agree listen it's the media that said that I said
[01:52:50.920 --> 01:52:54.520]  Parkland didn't happen so they're going to try to misrepresent whatever we do we're being extra
[01:52:54.520 --> 01:52:58.520]  careful even when it's being reported by other newspapers the identity of the shooter I said
[01:52:58.520 --> 01:53:04.520]  it may not be true just because they try to twist everything we do right now I understand I understand
[01:53:04.520 --> 01:53:09.320]  Alex it's just you know how do you know how important it is so and and we do too so it's
[01:53:09.320 --> 01:53:12.680]  just really important to make sure we have the information no I totally agree here's the bottom
[01:53:12.680 --> 01:53:17.880]  line we already have hog and the rest of usual suspects blaming the second amendment blaming
[01:53:17.880 --> 01:53:22.760]  Trump so all I'm saying the parents are conservatives and christians and patriots are always very
[01:53:22.760 --> 01:53:27.000]  reserved the left's going to be out there today they're going to find their people they want to
[01:53:27.000 --> 01:53:31.880]  spokespersons it's critical that people that don't want the first amendment or second amendment
[01:53:31.880 --> 01:53:37.560]  blamed get on the news and I know that's I know people out there aren't glory pigs and you know
[01:53:37.560 --> 01:53:42.760]  aren't wanting to be on television but I guarantee you they're looking at parents in the democratic
[01:53:42.760 --> 01:53:48.120]  party they're looking at anti-gunner databases and they're calling people right now to stick them
[01:53:48.120 --> 01:53:53.000]  on CNN ABC CBS and everywhere else to demonize the second amendment so that's why I'm saying
[01:53:53.720 --> 01:53:59.000]  I agree the police responded quickly probably a real shooting you know who knows uh we're always
[01:53:59.000 --> 01:54:02.360]  going to you know sit back and look and when I say real shooting you know real the way they're
[01:54:02.360 --> 01:54:07.080]  saying it is because I guess last hour he's probably a devil worshiper and according to the news
[01:54:07.080 --> 01:54:13.080]  you know that looks like what he is yeah like I don't I'm not I'm not demonizing anyone I don't
[01:54:13.080 --> 01:54:17.880]  know this this kid from you know from Adam so I'm not not going to make any accusations there I
[01:54:17.880 --> 01:54:24.120]  don't know what he did was evil and there's no question about it but um you know when we when
[01:54:24.120 --> 01:54:28.280]  I went to high school here we used to have guns in our back windows that were trucks after school
[01:54:28.280 --> 01:54:31.720]  we'd go dove hunt you know we're like okay we're going dove hunt bring your guns we're going such
[01:54:31.720 --> 01:54:35.800]  such uh we're going to the beam field we're gonna go out there and go dove hunt okay we six or seven
[01:54:35.800 --> 01:54:39.880]  of us bring our guns to school leave them in our on our windows you know on our back windows in our
[01:54:39.880 --> 01:54:44.760]  trucks and after school we'd go dove hunt and uh so you know obviously you can't do that anymore
[01:54:44.760 --> 01:54:49.480]  but uh yeah the world is changing I'd like to say also that what if people would understand what
[01:54:49.480 --> 01:54:55.160]  they're doing to trump right now they're using the exact same tactic tactic against constitutional
[01:54:55.160 --> 01:54:59.160]  law in this country they keep trying to tell everybody that democracy it's not but they're
[01:54:59.160 --> 01:55:03.400]  using the same thing there we're a constitutional republic and they're dismantling the country just
[01:55:03.400 --> 01:55:09.160]  like he said ms-13 are animals they said that he said Hispanics are animals everything they do is
[01:55:09.160 --> 01:55:14.680]  twisting and deception Rodney if you want to leave us your number uh as a point of contact for Owen
[01:55:14.680 --> 01:55:18.360]  or if you want to talk to us I'm going to put you on hold god bless you and I appreciate your fine
[01:55:18.360 --> 01:55:23.640]  points they've got john and others that are eyewitnesses will go to them as well anything else you
[01:55:23.640 --> 01:55:29.000]  want to add Rodney no I just but we need we need we need to pray for America pray for our youth
[01:55:29.640 --> 01:55:33.960]  and uh you know stay stay close to Jesus because he's the only he's the only girl protection that
[01:55:33.960 --> 01:55:38.200]  we have anymore no I totally agree and well you heard Ted Nugent this is an evil problem
[01:55:39.400 --> 01:55:44.440]  absolutely I agree a hundred percent god bless you the only reason I said he was probably a
[01:55:44.440 --> 01:55:49.000]  devil or spirit is they're almost always where black prince codes and have pentagrams and love
[01:55:49.000 --> 01:55:53.960]  satan and play shoot them up video games and then people go oh don't blame video games they're in
[01:55:53.960 --> 01:55:57.640]  the video games I'm not saying normal person playing one of those is going to do it but if
[01:55:57.640 --> 01:56:01.240]  you're already mentally ill and you're on one of these prozac drugs I mean look he was wearing
[01:56:01.240 --> 01:56:08.920]  communist pens uh german pens world war one iron crosses pentagrams it's just whatever he could
[01:56:08.920 --> 01:56:13.160]  wear to be shocking and look powerful and evil and I guess he thought going and killing a bunch of
[01:56:13.160 --> 01:56:18.120]  innocent people would just prove how evil he was to his master I've done an hour and 58 minutes

[02:01:23.240 --> 02:01:28.280]  that what we say has power i get that and i'm not saying every mass shooting stage i don't think most
[02:01:28.280 --> 02:01:34.200]  of them are they stand down in these democrat areas they let the attacks happen the people are always on
[02:01:34.200 --> 02:01:38.600]  psychotropic drugs it's the same story they're always wearing black prince coats they're always
[02:01:38.600 --> 02:01:46.920]  into devil worship it's the mo of we know the type of evil the big octopus is the devil here folks
[02:01:48.840 --> 02:01:56.680]  so i get it when i say staged i mean that the culture has staged this he's got this hydra and
[02:01:56.680 --> 02:02:03.320]  this pentagram and communist and nazi paraphernalia and that's what i know about devil worshipers
[02:02:03.320 --> 02:02:06.680]  they're in to whatever they think is dark and bad
[02:02:11.320 --> 02:02:15.320]  you know i'll give black people this they ever once in a while are into voodoo
[02:02:15.320 --> 02:02:21.000]  but they don't think that's the devil but i don't know any black people that are in to actually
[02:02:21.000 --> 02:02:26.680]  wearing pentagrams and stuff i don't think i've ever seen one do it but i tell you whites and
[02:02:26.680 --> 02:02:34.280]  hispanics and people do it and it's the mainly white people and it's it's sick and people think
[02:02:34.280 --> 02:02:38.200]  it's powerful and i'll be honest when i see somebody wearing a big pentagram around their neck
[02:02:38.200 --> 02:02:44.680]  or something i want to punch them in the nose because statistically i know that's the group
[02:02:44.680 --> 02:02:49.960]  you got to watch right there and ms-13's into a bunch of devil worship too and i'm sick of it
[02:02:50.840 --> 02:02:55.560]  and they're worse than animals animals are nice compared to this crud i'm sick of devil

[02:03:13.960 --> 02:03:20.200]  expect there's nothing to happen there you know i don't think anybody has told you but there was
[02:03:20.200 --> 02:03:28.280]  another incident about a month or two ago at the same school with a uh oh a suspected shooter i'm
[02:03:28.280 --> 02:03:33.320]  trying to get ahold of my grandson right now who is still in lockdown at school by the way
[02:03:35.320 --> 02:03:41.320]  to get the information on that but he uh uh they still haven't let him out he's in the junior high
[02:03:41.320 --> 02:03:47.480]  they're still locked in over there another incident huh yeah there was this about two
[02:03:47.480 --> 02:03:51.880]  months ago the that's the same high school was in shutdown they they had the roads blocked off
[02:03:51.880 --> 02:03:58.920]  and everything that like i said it's been a month to go uh i i can't i was about to say
[02:03:58.920 --> 02:04:02.840]  they use these drills sometimes the school administrators do i'm not even blaming the
[02:04:02.840 --> 02:04:08.040]  police the bureaucrats do to cover up things that happen but they said they've had two drills
[02:04:08.040 --> 02:04:11.720]  that's even been on the news in the last two months perhaps that can be what you're talking about
[02:04:11.720 --> 02:04:18.360]  uh i i don't know i don't know if they i just heard the other gentleman i believe it was dale

[02:04:44.760 --> 02:04:49.480]  it all on the other side and i this is totally overshadowed the guy that went into the trump

[02:07:05.480 --> 02:07:11.160]  could be nazi couldn't be but that's that that's what i've noticed about devil warspers is that's
[02:07:11.160 --> 02:07:17.400]  just a pantheon of evil now he's the alleged shooter who's still alive and now it's being
[02:07:17.400 --> 02:07:22.680]  reported it's on info wars dot com first place we saw it about 30 minutes ago right after caller
[02:07:22.680 --> 02:07:29.960]  talked about it uh was the big metro paper uh out of london england but we're all watching info
[02:07:29.960 --> 02:07:37.080]  wars dot com and drugs report dot com also has uh excellent coverage of what's going on
[02:07:38.120 --> 02:07:41.560]  so that's just some of the news there's also been a cuban plane crash developing
[02:07:44.840 --> 02:07:49.320]  we're going to be looking at all of that it's now 10 dad in texas school shooting
[02:07:49.320 --> 02:07:54.440]  in most reports some are saying eight and other reports let's hope that uh it's it's only a
[02:07:55.400 --> 02:07:58.920]  i haven't even covered this yet and i will after we take calls i meant to open the show up with it
[02:07:58.920 --> 02:08:06.200]  man opens fire at trump miami resort spewing hate about president who is jonathan odie we will
[02:08:06.200 --> 02:08:09.800]  talk about all of that i i had that printed my stack this morning but never went to it
[02:08:11.160 --> 02:08:16.680]  i've got all these notes i've written so please get me who is jonathan jonathan odie the reported
[02:08:16.680 --> 02:08:22.440]  shooter now again how this works folks his mainstream media will link to somebody and say
[02:08:22.440 --> 02:08:27.000]  they're the shooter i'll cover it it'll be changed later than i get sued because that's
[02:08:27.000 --> 02:08:30.760]  because the democrats are targeting me so we have to put lots of provisos in here
[02:08:32.520 --> 02:08:39.240]  as it unfolds trump's coming out saying that the doj is out to frame me his approval
[02:08:39.240 --> 02:08:46.200]  ready continues to go up and up and up a lot of experts are saying obama's legacy is already
[02:08:46.200 --> 02:08:51.640]  destroyed we're going to be talking about all of that after we take some more of your phone calls
[02:08:53.000 --> 02:08:57.560]  but if you go back to info wars dot com we've got all the live feeds up there and you may say
[02:08:57.560 --> 02:09:01.640]  well alex we're already watching on local tv or already listening on local radio or we're already
[02:09:01.640 --> 02:09:07.480]  listening watching the feed on info wars dot com i know but that's how we reach more people it's
[02:09:07.480 --> 02:09:12.680]  how we get around the sensors if you'll just spread the links if you'll just spread the articles if
[02:09:12.680 --> 02:09:17.560]  you'll just do that it will bypass soros and facebook and twitter and youtube they're trying
[02:09:17.560 --> 02:09:28.680]  to physically block us and of course there's another big story here we've totally caught
[02:09:29.320 --> 02:09:35.960]  bolton it's now admitted trying to say we're going to give north korea the libya treatment
[02:09:35.960 --> 02:09:39.240]  which is exactly what they don't want so that they'd break the deal with trump
[02:09:39.240 --> 02:09:44.440]  talk about deep state sabotage and i'm sure trump knows what he's doing but he keeps bringing these
[02:09:44.440 --> 02:09:51.160]  neocons in uh that cannot be trusted and i think this is a big reason to throw bolton out on his
[02:09:51.160 --> 02:09:57.800]  face because he may think trump wasn't watching cbs news he only watches fox news when he went on
[02:09:57.800 --> 02:10:03.320]  face the nation and said all that but that is just an incredible attempt to sabotage this important
[02:10:03.320 --> 02:10:08.920]  historic peace deal all right johns and eyewitness and santa fe finishing up then we'll go to john
[02:10:08.920 --> 02:10:17.640]  who used to live in santa fe and says the city sympathizes with the kkk okay well i know east
[02:10:17.640 --> 02:10:25.240]  texas has some of that going on but i've been through santa fe it's like 70 minority but okay
[02:10:25.240 --> 02:10:30.520]  well i mean i'll i'll i'll hear that from john uh but john the eyewitness go ahead and finish
[02:10:30.520 --> 02:10:38.680]  up thanks for holding yeah the alex uh just want to confirm to you that uh i have had from good good
[02:10:38.680 --> 02:10:47.080]  sources i i do work for the x maripax uh santa fe uh he confirmed to me there are 10 dead uh
[02:10:47.080 --> 02:10:53.880]  from his his sources so that's that is 10 dead i mean not official but that's what i was told
[02:10:53.880 --> 02:10:59.000]  he gets you know he knows everybody he he rubs elbows with the current administration so
[02:10:59.000 --> 02:11:06.840]  uh but anyways i just before we get into what i saw uh i deal with this witchcraft and satanism
[02:11:06.840 --> 02:11:13.000]  on a daily basis i'm a lay preacher uh probably if you was to talk to your reporters i send them
[02:11:13.000 --> 02:11:19.640]  articles i write all the time uh they could probably confirm that i've been doing it for 25 years uh
[02:11:20.280 --> 02:11:27.400]  yeah these these people are they're they're they're just nuts and crazy and uh 15 minutes after
[02:11:27.400 --> 02:11:34.440]  that happened my daughter sent me that man's that that boy's a 17-year-old boy's facebook
[02:11:35.320 --> 02:11:40.600]  profile i've got the pictures and stuff of course they've already jerk jerk it down but i've got the
[02:11:40.600 --> 02:11:45.880]  screenshot say uh to which i will write an article this evening when i get home from work
[02:11:46.840 --> 02:11:55.240]  but uh yeah he he pentagrams man the man's a devil worshiper is what he is and uh uh my grandson
[02:11:55.240 --> 02:12:01.000]  is trying to gather some more information about him which i will write and put it in an article but
[02:12:02.280 --> 02:12:10.360]  onto what i saw uh uh probably about 10 minutes after that happened alex you would not believe i
[02:12:10.360 --> 02:12:20.760]  mean i have never in my life seen so many police cars and in first responders going i was coming
[02:12:20.760 --> 02:12:28.680]  up highway six in santa fe not too far from the high school uh when uh all the cops responded i mean
[02:12:28.680 --> 02:12:34.840]  they it's it was like cockroaches coming out of the woodwork after these being sprayed i mean it
[02:12:34.840 --> 02:12:42.200]  was it was then in for an hour afterward i mean there was there was uh police coming from
[02:12:43.560 --> 02:12:48.920]  cities five ten miles away i was about to say this is the point i meant to make
[02:12:48.920 --> 02:12:54.120]  you you've got this incredibly expensive school that looks like it probably costs 300 million
[02:12:54.120 --> 02:12:59.480]  dollars nice beautiful facility huge they just built it yes they just built it three or four years
[02:12:59.480 --> 02:13:06.520]  ago yes and it's a huge nice facility and they couldn't afford but two security guards for thousands
[02:13:06.520 --> 02:13:12.440]  and thousands and thousands of students but 10 minutes after you've got it looks like 300 police
[02:13:12.440 --> 02:13:16.120]  cars i mean like you because we're showing helicopter shots and and that's great i'm glad
[02:13:16.120 --> 02:13:22.600]  they've got those resources but why not have them stationed in place just five or six officers
[02:13:22.600 --> 02:13:28.360]  instead of 200 show up 10 minutes late and i'm not blaming them but it just doesn't make sense if
[02:13:28.360 --> 02:13:34.920]  you know the schools are the target of these devil worshipers there's 15 i think there's 1500
[02:13:34.920 --> 02:13:40.600]  students in that school system just that one right there santa fe has a couple other and they get
[02:13:40.600 --> 02:13:50.040]  they're just building another another middle school uh uh this has got to stop people got to
[02:13:50.040 --> 02:13:57.960]  quit blaming the damn guns and start putting the blame where exactly the blame needs to go it's on

[02:20:40.520 --> 02:20:46.520]  of people killing hundreds with the truck we're gonna ban trucks but that's intentional not by
[02:20:46.520 --> 02:20:55.320]  the truck by the isis member but we got 107 people perhaps dead we don't know after a Boeing 737
[02:20:55.320 --> 02:21:05.000]  airliner carrying 107 people crashes moments after takeoff a real tragedy there the plane
[02:21:05.000 --> 02:21:12.760]  reporter leap belongs to the government of cuba the domestic flight was due to last around 20 minutes
[02:21:12.760 --> 02:21:20.600]  the crash between the locality there inside cuba outside havana
[02:21:24.120 --> 02:21:27.480]  that's part of life folks there's seven and a half billion of us
[02:21:29.160 --> 02:21:33.960]  and millions are coming in every day millions are going out every day i forget the number how
[02:21:33.960 --> 02:21:39.160]  many people are born every day and how many die every day last time i checked it was like 400
[02:21:39.160 --> 02:21:45.960]  something thousand that was years ago some factoid so who knows if that's right can we look up the
[02:21:45.960 --> 02:21:53.720]  number of people estimated to be born every day versus die every day coming in coming out constantly
[02:21:53.720 --> 02:21:59.720]  checking in checking out constantly our hearts go out to those who died but you don't ban aviation
[02:22:00.680 --> 02:22:05.480]  because it happened it's still very very rare to die in a plane crash if you live in a western
[02:22:05.480 --> 02:22:09.320]  country now if you live in cuba they have a worse record than other countries because they're communist
[02:22:12.520 --> 02:22:17.960]  who is jonathan odie the man shot by cops after firing a gun at trump national
[02:22:19.160 --> 02:22:23.720]  by the way that had some of the top world championships held there until trump got
[02:22:23.720 --> 02:22:27.320]  elected and they took it away from him all things trump's been punished for he's lost
[02:22:27.320 --> 02:22:32.760]  reportedly billions of dollars for what he's done standing up for us we should never forget that
[02:22:32.760 --> 02:22:37.400]  less than a year ago south african native jonathan odie proudly posed behind the background of an
[02:22:37.400 --> 02:22:43.800]  american flag titan's citizenship god bless the usa in america he wrote but now he's an anti-trump
[02:22:43.800 --> 02:22:50.360]  person we'll cover that after we talk to the next caller jon says he used to live in san afa
[02:22:50.360 --> 02:22:58.760]  and he's got some comments go ahead jon hi alex uh first of all i live there from early 2003 until
[02:22:58.760 --> 02:23:04.680]  july of 2006 and for the record most of the people wait a minute i know jon jon's one of our
[02:23:04.680 --> 02:23:11.240]  longtime callers we even know jon ish yes sir and uh most of the people there in san afa were
[02:23:11.240 --> 02:23:19.080]  wonderful people know if sands or butts about it however there was a small cadre of kkk types
[02:23:19.080 --> 02:23:29.320]  and here's what they did first of all in around july uh june or july of 2006 they went to a young
[02:23:29.320 --> 02:23:35.880]  black woman's house now this young lady had not done anything or said anything to disparage anyone
[02:23:35.880 --> 02:23:42.120]  or to hurt anyone she was just minding her business and trying to raise her family in peace and quiet
[02:23:42.120 --> 02:23:51.800]  and they spray painted her white home with black graffiti from a spray can with vile slogans and
[02:23:51.800 --> 02:23:57.720]  garbage that you couldn't say over the air and of course the usual swastikas all over the house
[02:23:58.280 --> 02:24:05.240]  and i went before the city council and criticized the kkk and by the way at the time the jp
[02:24:05.240 --> 02:24:12.360]  was both the head of the kkk chapter and the masonic lodge chapter there in san afa i don't
[02:24:12.360 --> 02:24:20.440]  know if he still is or not but i criticized them i said here we are in 2006 and there are some
[02:24:20.440 --> 02:24:26.840]  people still living in the stone age and what happened just a couple of nights later someone
[02:24:26.840 --> 02:24:32.360]  came over to the rental property that i was renting it was on the same property as my landlords
[02:24:32.360 --> 02:24:40.200]  and they keyed my truck they scratched it up with a key and i called the police and the officer came
[02:24:40.200 --> 02:24:46.680]  down there and took the report and then the next night they did it again and i called the officer
[02:24:46.680 --> 02:24:53.240]  and he came by there and i asked the officer i said what would happen if i caught someone vandalizing
[02:24:53.240 --> 02:25:00.120]  my truck and shot him he said well then you'd go to prison i said fine what would happen if i caught
[02:25:00.120 --> 02:25:05.960]  someone vandalizing my truck and hosed him down with some pepper spray then you'd be charged with
[02:25:05.960 --> 02:25:13.000]  a salt and battery not once did that officer mention what he would do to the criminal who was
[02:25:13.000 --> 02:25:20.520]  vandalizing my truck not once then when i called the police chief to speak to him his very nice
[02:25:20.520 --> 02:25:27.400]  secretary told me john he's out of town for a few more days he's on vacation i'll have him call you
[02:25:27.400 --> 02:25:34.840]  when he gets back two weeks after he returned to town he still had not called me he made no attempt
[02:25:34.840 --> 02:25:40.680]  to call me now let me tell you about another thing that happened go back to the virginia tech shooting
[02:25:41.400 --> 02:25:47.960]  32 innocent lives were slaughtered at virginia tech and just three days after the virginia tech
[02:25:47.960 --> 02:25:55.080]  massacre i'm watching network television and they ran a commercial for a video game where they show
[02:25:55.080 --> 02:26:02.200]  this cartoon character walking into his house taking up a 1911 45 automatic screwing on a
[02:26:02.200 --> 02:26:08.840]  suppressor and then walking outside and routinely shooting innocent people who walked by his house
[02:26:08.840 --> 02:26:14.520]  no i know and there's a big video game lobby whenever i say video games are connected to mass
[02:26:14.520 --> 02:26:19.640]  murder they were developed to make troops not hesitate and pull a trigger out for vietnam had
[02:26:19.640 --> 02:26:25.320]  issues and i'm not saying ban the video games but it's absolutely a fact and they go don't censor
[02:26:25.320 --> 02:26:32.360]  our video games look i'm not censoring your video games i'm saying these are military training games
[02:26:32.920 --> 02:26:37.640]  and you put a mentally ill person on them they're going to turn into a psychotic and they're
[02:26:37.640 --> 02:26:43.320]  contributing factors to these headcases who go around because the thing you have to ask have
[02:26:43.320 --> 02:26:48.280]  hey pushes them over the edge it pushes them over the edge right now have your reporters ask the
[02:26:48.280 --> 02:26:53.560]  mainstream media types who are going to be covering this thing and santa fe asked them one question
[02:26:54.120 --> 02:27:01.240]  give us the name of one murderer rapist arm robber drug dealer gangbanger head case terrorist or
[02:27:01.240 --> 02:27:07.000]  school shooter who obeys gun laws give us their name that's i was about to say i want to have a
[02:27:07.000 --> 02:27:13.080]  press conference tonight uh in santa fe and i wanted to have olyn call some of the locals we
[02:27:13.080 --> 02:27:17.240]  talked to him pick a park or something near that school where we're going to have the press conference
[02:27:17.240 --> 02:27:22.440]  we can announce on air for all our listeners that are in that area south texas houston you name it
[02:27:22.440 --> 02:27:28.600]  to go show a big show there of people and also go out and canvas the locals and get these eyewitnesses
[02:27:28.600 --> 02:27:33.480]  because we may not get it on tape but you may shoot it on your smartphone put it on youtube
[02:27:33.480 --> 02:27:37.720]  you know of key information and again we're not saying this got staged we're not saying it's a
[02:27:37.720 --> 02:27:41.320]  false flag we're not saying it was a police stand down because we're not getting early reports of
[02:27:41.320 --> 02:27:45.480]  that looks like the police went right in what we are saying is the democrats are going to canvas
[02:27:45.480 --> 02:27:50.600]  these people they're going to pick a few anti-gun folks who will then be the spokespersons for the
[02:27:50.600 --> 02:27:59.960]  entire school we need that's the way they always did alex go back to uh early oh gosh 1983 i was
[02:27:59.960 --> 02:28:05.640]  living in houston at the time and the epa came to town and they wanted in order to reduce air
[02:28:05.640 --> 02:28:13.160]  pollution they wanted all houstonians to drive 75 fewer miles now they never said how are you
[02:28:13.160 --> 02:28:18.760]  gonna get to work or get to school or get your shopping done or anything else and then despite
[02:28:18.760 --> 02:28:25.160]  the fact that hundreds of us packed the auditorium there at the marriott in south houston they then
[02:28:25.160 --> 02:28:30.600]  picked a few people as change agents that they claim represent you one woman from the league of
[02:28:30.600 --> 02:28:38.040]  women voters and a young punk from uh the fiera club who favored the epa proposals no i know they
[02:28:38.040 --> 02:28:41.960]  go out and they act like it's called the delphi technique they have a public event they act like

[02:33:32.680 --> 02:33:38.760]  learning about a new plan the trump administration is set to propose today this is important new
[02:33:38.760 --> 02:33:43.560]  restrictions on abortion and clinics which provide them let's go back to christin welker at the
[02:33:43.560 --> 02:33:47.960]  white house has been following this closely christin what have you got significant development
[02:33:47.960 --> 02:33:54.600]  alley the trump administration expected to announce later today that it will limit federal funding
[02:33:54.600 --> 02:34:02.760]  essentially block federal funding from clinics that offer abortion services or that refer patients
[02:34:02.760 --> 02:34:09.800]  to other clinics for those purposes now why is this being done well the white house says this is a
[02:34:09.800 --> 02:34:14.040]  campaign promise made a campaign promise kept a white house official telling me donald trump
[02:34:14.040 --> 02:34:20.280]  ran as a pro-life candidate and has governed as a pro-life president another promise made
[02:34:20.280 --> 02:34:25.720]  and kept essentially saying look uh this is something that the president is following through
[02:34:25.720 --> 02:34:30.120]  with that he promised out on the campaign it's something that conservatives his base
[02:34:30.120 --> 02:34:35.320]  are cheering alley this is a move that they wanted to see take place and of course it comes
[02:34:35.320 --> 02:34:39.640]  ahead of the midterms there's a lot of concern within the republican ranks that they're going
[02:34:39.640 --> 02:34:44.120]  to lose key seats that they may even lose the house of representatives this is one more data
[02:34:44.120 --> 02:34:50.120]  point that this white house that republicans could use out on the campaign trail on the other hand
[02:34:50.120 --> 02:34:55.400]  you have a lot of opposition to this move plan parenthood the executive vice president saying
[02:34:55.400 --> 02:35:03.560]  simply this is an attempt to take away basic rights period so expect a strong backlash by those who
[02:35:03.560 --> 02:35:10.280]  say it limits the ability of places like plan parenthood which not only offer abortion services
[02:35:10.280 --> 02:35:15.720]  and counseling on abortion but that offer other women's health services and that ultimately stripping
[02:35:15.720 --> 02:35:20.360]  this type of federal funding could strip funding away from some of those other critical health
[02:35:20.360 --> 02:35:25.160]  services that go for women so this is highly contentious but a significant announcement
[02:35:25.160 --> 02:35:29.000]  that we're anticipating from the white house leader on today alley all right christin thanks
[02:35:29.000 --> 02:35:36.440]  very much 50 plus percent of black people never make it out of their mama's womb
[02:35:39.240 --> 02:35:42.440]  but liberals will attack me for not using whatever the new term is for somebody
[02:35:43.800 --> 02:35:47.960]  i literally at a spiritual level feel horrible about any child being chopped up fighting for
[02:35:47.960 --> 02:35:53.560]  its life with chemical sprayed onto it or scalpels i mean i've talked to the doctors it's been in the
[02:35:53.560 --> 02:35:59.960]  news the babies fight for their lives one of our crew members brother had a baby that died two weeks
[02:35:59.960 --> 02:36:04.440]  four term and he got a in velcro core wrapped around his neck and they said the baby had fought
[02:36:04.440 --> 02:36:10.200]  to get out of it i've got four children and you know you see spike lee shaking in hate for trump
[02:36:11.480 --> 02:36:16.600]  with made-up stuff trump never said and the new thing oh he says hispanics are animals no he said
[02:36:16.600 --> 02:36:24.120]  ms-13 are animals and it's just the pure evil of lying about trump who never claimed he was
[02:36:24.120 --> 02:36:28.680]  a goody to shoot with women or any of this but he is pro-life he is following what he said he would
[02:36:28.680 --> 02:36:33.640]  do and that's why they hate him so much folks and it's a magic moment you know i really appreciate
[02:36:33.640 --> 02:36:39.080]  reverend plinard children's coming on he's come on all the time time passes we get busy he was nice
[02:36:39.080 --> 02:36:43.400]  to let him move him back in our because of the tragic mass shooting with a devil worshiper i
[02:36:43.400 --> 02:36:47.160]  predict you'd hour one will be a devil worshiper because it always is they try to cover it up with
[02:36:47.160 --> 02:36:53.080]  this guy pentagrams devil worship shoot them up games it's always the same thing but he's the pastor
[02:36:53.080 --> 02:36:59.320]  clenard our children's author filmmaker black genocide dot org i'm not going to go over all
[02:36:59.320 --> 02:37:03.560]  his diplomas or background or what he fights with the films he's made and how he goes to congress
[02:37:03.560 --> 02:37:08.520]  and tries to get the black caucus to actually come out and you know get people to actually talk
[02:37:08.520 --> 02:37:12.520]  about the real black genocide going on it's a genocide period that's particularly targeted
[02:37:12.520 --> 02:37:17.880]  blacks the blacks are 13 percent of the population they're half last time i checked the abortions in
[02:37:17.880 --> 02:37:23.320]  this country and i'll sit there when some crazy leftist white person black persons in my face
[02:37:23.320 --> 02:37:29.560]  calling me a racist that's what trump's spinning in my face and i'll say hey don't you care they
[02:37:29.560 --> 02:37:35.480]  abort half the black people oh shut up you nazi nobody wants those babies so he's here to break
[02:37:35.480 --> 02:37:43.000]  that down to see how trump has delivered again and i just don't know how people continue to
[02:37:43.000 --> 02:37:50.280]  say that kanye west is bad uh or they could say that i'm bad or they can say that kandace owens
[02:37:50.280 --> 02:37:55.080]  is bad or they can say that anybody who supports the president is all these evil things when i
[02:37:55.080 --> 02:37:59.480]  don't know what planet they're living on are they living on the same planet as us reverend clenard
[02:37:59.480 --> 02:38:05.400]  shelbert because you're a leading expert on black genocide well no question the facts are beginning
[02:38:05.400 --> 02:38:11.320]  to come out and i really want to say thank you for all that you've done over this past year and a
[02:38:11.320 --> 02:38:18.200]  half of making sure truth gets to the forefront of discussion uh given kandace owens a very
[02:38:18.200 --> 02:38:24.920]  articulate young black woman a space to share her mind her heart who would ever think kanye west
[02:38:24.920 --> 02:38:32.040]  would make the comments he made but uh it's all coming now to a point of discussion and and they
[02:38:32.040 --> 02:38:38.200]  know they lose i'm never i never thought i would see america in this state at this present time
[02:38:38.920 --> 02:38:46.760]  the vitriol the hatred the lies the deceit they're so blatant now and it's really about power
[02:38:47.480 --> 02:38:53.240]  they realize they're about to lose power after kanye west's comments i don't know if it had
[02:38:53.240 --> 02:39:00.200]  anything to do with that of uh of kandace owens i like how she thinks um the polling for african
[02:39:00.200 --> 02:39:09.480]  americans rose up to i think amongst men 22 percent doubled in support at alex they know it's over
[02:39:09.480 --> 02:39:15.960]  if that's the case this cannot continue to grow they will do anything i'm scared for my family
[02:39:15.960 --> 02:39:23.640]  when they go out i am concerned about anyone who is speaking truth they are so desperate i never
[02:39:23.640 --> 02:39:28.520]  thought i'd see this they are so desperate to stay in power quantify that you talked about this a lot
[02:39:28.520 --> 02:39:33.960]  years ago blacks are 13 percent but they're a key tipping voting block for the democrats without
[02:39:33.960 --> 02:39:39.560]  black folks they have nothing that's it and they're realizing that now your listeners need to know
[02:39:39.560 --> 02:39:47.080]  know and you stated all the time they are utter panic right now they are going to lose their minds
[02:39:47.640 --> 02:39:54.440]  and i'm afraid to what's going to happen and even the shooting today it would not surprise me if
[02:39:54.440 --> 02:40:00.760]  there was somehow someone soup this guy's head up someone did something i don't put anything past
[02:40:00.760 --> 02:40:08.440]  them at this point trump must be stopped and now you have the Mueller investigation folding up like
[02:40:08.440 --> 02:40:15.080]  a piece of paper he's he doesn't know what basically they were hanging their hat on that and now you
[02:40:15.080 --> 02:40:22.120]  have a president who actually keeps his promise yes he ran on a pro-life program and no doubt
[02:40:22.120 --> 02:40:28.920]  african americans are hearing these facts now that uh 12.4 percent of the population but accounting
[02:40:28.920 --> 02:40:33.640]  for 36 percent of the abortions i understand it's a little lower now i'm so happy to hear that but i
[02:40:33.640 --> 02:40:39.000]  don't know if that's from either from chemical abortions because they don't have cities it's 50
[02:40:39.000 --> 02:40:46.680]  percent right well in new york city more babies are boarded than born in the african-american
[02:40:46.680 --> 02:40:54.200]  community as many philadelphia is the same way uh la and chicago so i'm glad to hear those numbers
[02:40:54.200 --> 02:40:59.480]  since we talked to you're going to start to drop some they are starting to drop it's it's programs
[02:40:59.480 --> 02:41:06.120]  like this that are beginning to take root and they know it's taking root it's amazing to me
[02:41:06.680 --> 02:41:17.320]  that unquestionably as i walk the streets now there's not this total allegiance to the party
[02:41:17.880 --> 02:41:23.560]  that is perceived to be the facilitator of the civil rights movement they're now questioning
[02:41:23.560 --> 02:41:30.280]  this is a great time for activists to be out to be in but like you said they are scared and striking
[02:41:30.280 --> 02:41:36.120]  back no i'm really fearful alex i don't know what's going to happen they have to do something in order
[02:41:36.120 --> 02:41:42.920]  to stay in power trump has to be stopped uh there has to be uh chaos in america there has to be
[02:41:42.920 --> 02:41:51.480]  confusion uh anybody in their right mind they watch a cnn msnbc can hear and see the total
[02:41:51.480 --> 02:41:59.480]  total bias uh surely there's no question that journalism is dead there's no objectivity give me
[02:41:59.480 --> 02:42:06.040]  the facts let me choose and let me then decide what i want to do we could take on any forum in the
[02:42:06.040 --> 02:42:12.040]  country as long as we're given a voice as long as we're able to present our case guess what they
[02:42:12.040 --> 02:42:19.640]  don't want that and this is scary how can berkeley censor free speech yeah i'm an old guy i remember
[02:42:19.640 --> 02:42:25.880]  berkeley being the citadel of free speech how can they then attack a conservative speaker
[02:42:25.880 --> 02:42:32.040]  we don't understand the older voice is off to have to point this this hypocrisy out without
[02:42:32.040 --> 02:42:38.760]  question but uh black genocide is becoming a forefront of discussion black genocide is now
[02:42:38.760 --> 02:42:43.400]  coming to the point where it's a discussion in the african-american community it's not where it
[02:42:43.400 --> 02:42:47.800]  should be but it's it's cool well thanks to you and others i was about to say that i watch youtube

[02:47:01.800 --> 02:47:21.800]  while you were sleeping they came and took it away the lanes in the middle
[02:47:21.800 --> 02:47:28.280]  the place is where you used to play
[02:47:34.680 --> 02:47:39.240]  we're back live folks and i i really want to ask reverend filters to come back for a full hour
[02:47:39.240 --> 02:47:42.760]  sometime next week we need to get him on every month anyway it's the great work he's done
[02:47:42.760 --> 02:47:47.640]  the books the films how he goes to congress and demands they talk about real issues and then you
[02:47:47.640 --> 02:47:52.360]  see these fake congressmen and women get up there and know they're diverting people from what they're
[02:47:52.360 --> 02:48:00.360]  really doing it's sick and this this whole agenda tag like america wasn't abolitionist or christian
[02:48:00.360 --> 02:48:03.880]  to act like the republicans didn't do the civil rights act not that they're perfect either
[02:48:04.440 --> 02:48:08.280]  and just all of it turns down the democrats as they flip everything into this whole
[02:48:08.280 --> 02:48:13.480]  race-based narrative and then the litmus test is okay well then you support
[02:48:13.480 --> 02:48:20.760]  in many cities the majority of black people never being born and it's just like and it's not like
[02:48:20.760 --> 02:48:25.880]  some virtue signaling i'm doing none of us are safe folks if they can do this to anybody and now
[02:48:25.880 --> 02:48:29.880]  trump's moving to cut the funding off to ban partial birth abortion to move it back to the
[02:48:29.880 --> 02:48:34.680]  states where it's going to be banned and this is like common is china where they sell political
[02:48:34.680 --> 02:48:38.760]  dissonance organs if we don't value our children we're not going to value old people
[02:48:38.760 --> 02:48:43.560]  right to value anybody and and and to see how conscious it is and then the wiki leaks that came
[02:48:43.560 --> 02:48:47.960]  out where there's top professors advising hillary they go we're losing control and she goes well
[02:48:47.960 --> 02:48:54.120]  what do we do she goes they go culture war that's another word for race war and you see it and it's
[02:48:54.120 --> 02:48:59.320]  and then kanye west sees through it anybody and they go oh you're just rich that's why you're he's
[02:48:59.320 --> 02:49:04.440]  like no i'm not saying stuff isn't going on but i'm transcending that and i'm not going to play into
[02:49:04.440 --> 02:49:09.080]  what they say i am in this whole game and then the one thing they can't debate is black genocide
[02:49:09.080 --> 02:49:14.600]  like i said i see all these people not even looking who are mainly really articulate smart black
[02:49:14.600 --> 02:49:20.040]  people all over youtube and stuff just laying everything out the reverend children says margaret
[02:49:20.040 --> 02:49:25.160]  sanger the whole fact and they say the litmus test is i don't want to hear about you know somebody
[02:49:25.160 --> 02:49:30.120]  being racist to me or this or that when it's some nebula seal how about this of the democratic party
[02:49:30.120 --> 02:49:34.520]  and they don't know how to deal with it so reverend children's just you've got a lot to say in the
[02:49:34.520 --> 02:49:40.040]  limited time we have a snapshot then of where you think the world is today and i agree you can see
[02:49:40.040 --> 02:49:45.720]  their full power of this global system with the china one child policy and the thing that genocide
[02:49:45.720 --> 02:49:49.560]  africa and genocide the third world and they're trying to genocide eastern europe they just are
[02:49:49.560 --> 02:49:55.160]  trying to knock everybody out soros is behind it but i think humanity is awakening and i think
[02:49:55.160 --> 02:50:01.720]  that's what scares them absolutely and they've been a stadium listeners black genocide is the key
[02:50:02.440 --> 02:50:09.560]  to overturning the ideology of this leftist liberalism marxism socialism that is coming
[02:50:09.560 --> 02:50:17.320]  to america because they need the african-american community to continually the support and sell
[02:50:17.320 --> 02:50:25.080]  out to this um and be that almost like as if the face of it because they need this to be able to
[02:50:25.080 --> 02:50:30.680]  uh perpetuate this throughout the world genocide it's it's basically social engineering that's the
[02:50:30.680 --> 02:50:37.320]  way they want to move and that's the way they want to unquestionably uh every hollywood movie every
[02:50:37.320 --> 02:50:42.680]  show is whites are killing you whites are out to get you except where the real racist globalist
[02:50:42.680 --> 02:50:52.280]  whites are actually killing you and let it be known white white supremacy is so clearly seen
[02:50:52.280 --> 02:51:01.160]  in the abortion industry now margaret sanger was a white supremacist i dare anybody in this country
[02:51:01.160 --> 02:51:08.280]  to take me on on that to have a simple debate if you're gonna break down the premise she said
[02:51:08.280 --> 02:51:15.880]  we gotta pull up the black weeds exactly was a she was a genocidalist she and she collaborated
[02:51:15.880 --> 02:51:23.800]  with the uh nazis in germany and unquestionably and do you know most of our college students
[02:51:23.800 --> 02:51:29.960]  don't know this when i'm traveling and i'm on college campuses they have no idea of this there
[02:51:29.960 --> 02:51:35.720]  has to be a grassroots it will totally tip the scale because there's one thing this generation
[02:51:35.720 --> 02:51:41.080]  that's in school and college students right now they don't want to be racist in any way for more
[02:51:41.080 --> 02:51:47.720]  fashion uh they're so afraid of the word racist but here it is and without without question this
[02:51:47.720 --> 02:51:55.480]  woman was clearly a white supremacist so how can why won't you demand her bus to be taken out of the
[02:51:55.480 --> 02:52:03.080]  smithsonian in washington dc why don't you demand the streets named after her like in new york city
[02:52:03.080 --> 02:52:09.080]  for that uh street to be renamed well let's call it for what it is because right now
[02:52:09.800 --> 02:52:16.920]  white males uh that show any sort of indifference towards african-american minorities
[02:52:16.920 --> 02:52:21.960]  are immediately called white supremacists white supremacists we're down with white supremacy
[02:52:21.960 --> 02:52:29.000]  you're a liar until margaret sanger comes down i won't even hear you i won't even recognize you
[02:52:29.000 --> 02:52:36.840]  you're hypocritical you're blatantly uh dissent deceitful margaret sanger was a white supremacist
[02:52:37.400 --> 02:52:45.160]  i want her out of our smithsonian i want her out of the public square she stood for hatred like
[02:52:45.160 --> 02:52:50.760]  you said hitler wrote public letters and said that she was his bible and they wrote each other
[02:52:50.760 --> 02:52:57.480]  letters i mean this is insane absolutely and so let's have the discussion but guess what
[02:52:57.480 --> 02:53:02.600]  they don't want that discussion that was time magazines had her what woman of the year twice
[02:53:02.600 --> 02:53:08.280]  even like a decade ago they should apologize but they won't we gotta make them i'm gonna listen
[02:53:08.280 --> 02:53:15.400]  i'm getting around resources on what they should be but i am going to confront all of them publicly
[02:53:15.400 --> 02:53:22.600]  with our signage we're gonna be out in front we want an apology why would you ever endorse and
[02:53:22.600 --> 02:53:30.040]  propagate this this woman's work in her doctrinal beliefs how can you ever hold her in high esteem
[02:53:30.040 --> 02:53:36.520]  why is she over the top 100 influential people in the country now she was but not in the in the
[02:53:36.520 --> 02:53:42.600]  vein that you're saying she was she was a brilliant strategist she was evil so here we are we want to
[02:53:42.600 --> 02:53:47.560]  call it for what it is and of course you know who funded her the rockefellers who funded they found
[02:53:47.560 --> 02:53:52.600]  her and they funded the colesprings harbour that taught the keiser velhelm institute everything i
[02:53:52.600 --> 02:53:59.560]  mean this is just a fact she the rockefellers and sanger basically created hitler yes yes and we
[02:53:59.560 --> 02:54:06.040]  need to first of all get it everybody is talking about uh they want their rights they want basically
[02:54:06.040 --> 02:54:13.560]  equality they they want diversity okay they didn't margaret sanger didn't he wanted to be
[02:54:13.560 --> 02:54:21.560]  elit them to be eliminated hitler got his ideas for concentration camps from her so uh we gotta
[02:54:21.560 --> 02:54:29.000]  understand that we have the goods now they are teetering please do not draw back they are being
[02:54:29.000 --> 02:54:35.320]  tipped over at this point politically i'm gonna be on you for probably 16 17 years i never heard
[02:54:35.320 --> 02:54:39.960]  you so positive uh but i'm not but i think you're right i think that's why they're so panicked
[02:54:39.960 --> 02:54:45.880]  is because this is all coming out it's coming out they know this is pivotal because it basically
[02:54:45.880 --> 02:54:52.440]  would say they would never back out of it that they supported this that they it's a part of their
[02:54:52.440 --> 02:54:59.240]  platform okay it's a part of their means of global control and like you said then they cover it up
[02:54:59.240 --> 02:55:02.520]  claiming they want to make everybody friendly when they're getting just average folks to fight with
[02:55:02.520 --> 02:55:07.240]  each other so they can come in with their whole agenda to be in charge and that's and that's never
[02:55:07.240 --> 02:55:13.880]  been new by the way we need to recognize that so what is happening and i think is awesome uh
[02:55:13.880 --> 02:55:20.680]  trump is keeping his promises we have to understand that we have a boss site construction forming
[02:55:20.680 --> 02:55:25.480]  as a president and that's refreshing he's not going to come forth as a presidential
[02:55:25.480 --> 02:55:32.360]  adequate that everybody wants but guess what he gets the job done let this if they give him

[03:00:02.040 --> 03:00:09.800]  be but one that might be this is not a new world it is simply an extension of what began in the old
[03:00:09.800 --> 03:00:15.560]  one it has patterned itself after every dictator who has ever planted the ripping imprint of a
[03:00:15.560 --> 03:00:22.520]  boot on the pages of history since the beginning of time it has refinements technological advances
[03:00:22.520 --> 03:00:29.000]  and a more sophisticated approach to the destruction of human freedom but like every one of the super
[03:00:29.000 --> 03:00:39.640]  states that preceded it it has one iron rule logic is an enemy and truth is a menace
[03:00:45.240 --> 03:00:53.400]  the answer to 1984 is 1776 you're listening to the alex jones show
[03:00:53.400 --> 03:01:03.320]  all right he's loaded for bear coming up to break down the whole communist globalist program
[03:01:03.320 --> 03:01:07.800]  and how that ties into it joe gilbert's got a bunch of guests lined up former communist you name it
[03:01:07.800 --> 03:01:10.680]  but finishing up the reverend shoulders someone invite back next week for full hour talk about
[03:01:10.680 --> 03:01:14.760]  what's happening get back into what happened right before the election what god told you
[03:01:14.760 --> 03:01:20.760]  and what you envisioned and now where we are today well basically if certainly we were trump
[03:01:20.760 --> 03:01:26.840]  caught everybody surprised a year prior and it came to me that this was the lord's choice i'm not
[03:01:26.840 --> 03:01:33.720]  the only person that said this and two days two or three two days before the election
[03:01:34.680 --> 03:01:42.600]  um i was praying and uh the lord said for me to uh have the church pray with you all night prayer
[03:01:42.600 --> 03:01:51.320]  for two nights that he had won that donald trump won the election but they would try to take it from
[03:01:51.320 --> 03:01:58.440]  him my naive self not having any idea what the depths of what god was saying i'm figuring okay
[03:01:58.440 --> 03:02:04.200]  they're gonna mess with the numbers that night we got to pray that that they don't take it from
[03:02:04.200 --> 03:02:07.880]  he said they're gonna try to take it from well they tried that too but you're right that after
[03:02:07.880 --> 03:02:14.680]  is when it really came right and i was just totally stunned at the revelation as i saw
[03:02:14.680 --> 03:02:22.680]  things unfolding straw page our own set brannon i mean this i i could not believe this that they
[03:02:22.680 --> 03:02:28.360]  were actually here you have a sitting president i really naively thought everybody would go to
[03:02:28.360 --> 03:02:35.240]  their respective corners they would wait his term out and basically you know there'd be resistance
[03:02:35.240 --> 03:02:42.040]  but not to the degree i didn't know there was a plan b to take him out this was crazy but
[03:02:42.040 --> 03:02:48.680]  it just fell into line to what the lord had laid on my heart and we continue to do that once a month
[03:02:48.680 --> 03:02:55.560]  to pray for him uh all night prayer and praying for him and the success of working his hands
[03:02:55.560 --> 03:03:01.240]  because what he god was basically saying okay i'll put him in but the prayers of the church
[03:03:01.240 --> 03:03:06.120]  have to keep him there that's what he was saying by the way the night i felt the same thing in my
[03:03:06.120 --> 03:03:10.280]  my gut my spirit which the older i get to learn to always go with when roger stone was right here
[03:03:10.280 --> 03:03:14.280]  and he won i said he's like why are you upset and i said they're really gonna come after us and him
[03:03:14.280 --> 03:03:19.720]  and everybody now we just began the war like they thought they were in power they're gonna flip out
[03:03:19.720 --> 03:03:24.520]  now and i just said i can feel their hatred i and i i just i just knew that it was coming
[03:03:24.520 --> 03:03:31.000]  Alex there's no question i mean you'll never receive the accolades and the rewards that
[03:03:31.800 --> 03:03:37.000]  your program has done to save america um it was just unquestionably i love the way
[03:03:37.640 --> 03:03:43.480]  that they that they try to make you to be some obscure source of relevant news and
[03:03:43.480 --> 03:03:49.480]  it proved to be something that was totally as you said uh something that the grassroots they
[03:03:49.480 --> 03:03:56.920]  were shocked at the the the power of the grassroots movement through this program and uh never
[03:03:56.920 --> 03:04:01.720]  other programs start taking your cue i've always been a supporter but i never really thought that
[03:04:01.720 --> 03:04:08.840]  the weight of the country would be on this program as well as others i thank god for no you too it's
[03:04:08.840 --> 03:04:13.160]  everybody together it's all of us together went over the edge and this is our little reprieve if

[03:05:16.760 --> 03:05:22.280]  what i saw medical doctors prescribing to their patients but it wasn't prescription but they were
[03:05:22.280 --> 03:05:28.120]  charging people a hundred two hundred dollars for the formulae and i came up with our own formula

[03:06:04.040 --> 03:06:24.200]  all right jones gilbert a documentary filmmaker author researcher he's taken over in just a
[03:06:24.200 --> 03:06:29.720]  minute or two oh and shroyer as we speak is arriving in santa fe texas a site of at least
[03:06:29.720 --> 03:06:35.080]  unfortunately 11 dead another school shooting the democrats blaming trump blaming the second
[03:06:35.080 --> 03:06:39.240]  amendment i'm not taking from their loss but thousands die every year drowning in pools
[03:06:39.240 --> 03:06:45.720]  thousands more in lakes thousands and jet ski accidents a big plane blew up crashed on takeoff
[03:06:45.720 --> 03:06:51.320]  with 109 people from cuba outside of anna it's it's there's a seven and a half billion of us
[03:06:51.320 --> 03:06:56.280]  we come in we come out of the world this guy appears to be a devil worshipper wearing a
[03:06:56.280 --> 03:07:04.520]  communist lapel pin uh we're gonna go live we're live now but in about 50 minutes with the war room
[03:07:04.520 --> 03:07:13.800]  with oh and shroyer roger stone myself oan and drew and the crew are down in south texas but coming
[03:07:13.800 --> 03:07:26.360]  up at 6 p.m if you look at a map on google earth uh of the school just two streets down towards the
[03:07:26.360 --> 03:07:32.280]  east is maple and tower and we know that that's right now where the police have things blocked
[03:07:32.280 --> 03:07:36.360]  if you get there and they're blocked out further i wouldn't expect that i'd imagine the perimeter will
[03:07:36.360 --> 03:07:41.160]  go in as they understand there's not other shooters though they say he had ied's and
[03:07:41.160 --> 03:07:48.200]  accomplishes who knows but oan shroyer at maple and tower tonight six o'clock a press conference
[03:07:48.200 --> 03:07:52.840]  and the press conference will be oan talking to the callers we already had and when we checked
[03:07:52.840 --> 03:07:59.640]  who they were from santa fe reporting on this guy being known that he was a devil worshipper
[03:07:59.640 --> 03:08:04.440]  that there was a stand down not by the police but a stand down by mental health and others just like
[03:08:04.440 --> 03:08:12.680]  we saw in parkland uh with nicholas cruz who we now know is part of this anti-racism program where
[03:08:12.680 --> 03:08:17.160]  he could commit burglaries and vandalism and threaten to kill people and he never went to jail
[03:08:17.160 --> 03:08:21.480]  because his last name was cruz even though he was adopted he was a white person adopted by
[03:08:21.480 --> 03:08:28.200]  hispanics who died before he died and before this event happened so maple and tower 6 p.m tonight
[03:08:29.240 --> 03:08:33.080]  if something happens just look you know down the street from that or up the street
[03:08:33.080 --> 03:08:40.040]  you'll find oan either up maple or up tower at the next checkpoint but right now the checkpoint's
[03:08:40.040 --> 03:08:49.560]  basically up from that so we've picked maple and tower 6 p.m if you are a parent or one of the
[03:08:49.560 --> 03:08:54.840]  surviving students or one of the victims don't wait for the democrats to show up in canvas the
[03:08:54.840 --> 03:08:58.600]  three thousand plus students big high school and pick four or five of their anti-gun to say
[03:08:58.600 --> 03:09:04.360]  they they represent you if you want a voice on info wars and a voice so fox news and others
[03:09:04.360 --> 03:09:10.440]  can see hey here's who to be interviewed to give their view that hey we don't want our guns taken
[03:09:10.440 --> 03:09:15.720]  because right now they're going to misrepresent you they're going to send in the the uh million
[03:09:15.720 --> 03:09:20.280]  mom marge the george soros groups that fund uh these current groups so they're going to take
[03:09:20.280 --> 03:09:25.960]  this over so we only just sit back here and and let them claim that they represent the people of
[03:09:25.960 --> 03:09:32.520]  santa fe and the texas down there so oan shroyer is there and we've already had more than a dozen
[03:09:32.520 --> 03:09:36.120]  parents and others say they're going to be there but if you live in houston and you've got a view

[03:11:03.480 --> 03:11:09.400]  today uh coming up we're gonna have former kgb lieutenant colonel constantan praeba jinsky
[03:11:09.400 --> 03:11:14.760]  an intelligence expert and he's gonna really explain to us the differences in the russian
[03:11:14.760 --> 03:11:20.360]  mentality uh the russians don't think like americans think they have completely different
[03:11:20.920 --> 03:11:25.560]  ideas and goals and values uh one thing he told me which we'll get into for example
[03:11:26.600 --> 03:11:32.200]  he said that when america and the world puts sanctions on russia it increases pudin's popularity
[03:11:33.080 --> 03:11:39.000]  so in the west uh teresa may of course the trump administration they think well if they poison
[03:11:39.000 --> 03:11:44.360]  somebody then we're going to put sanctions on them and that'll teach him his lesson in fact uh
[03:11:45.000 --> 03:11:51.960]  pudin gains uh popularity when these kind of things happen so we're going to talk to constantan
[03:11:51.960 --> 03:11:58.760]  he was very close to litvinenko who was poisoned and killed in in england uh he cannot go back to
[03:11:58.760 --> 03:12:04.520]  russia right now and he's going to really educate us uh there he is in my film there's no place like
[03:12:04.520 --> 03:12:08.360]  utopia he's going to give us a lot of education about how the russians think what they think of a
[03:12:08.360 --> 03:12:13.640]  lemur probe uh what they think of obama the iran deal and you're going to get a whole different
[03:12:13.640 --> 03:12:18.440]  world uh trying to understand the way well i know this guy's a high-profile guest so i'm really
[03:12:18.440 --> 03:12:23.960]  impressed you've got him coming on this is this is important information exactly so we'll have him
[03:12:23.960 --> 03:12:29.800]  up here uh he's written several books he's uh somebody that uh was inside the kgb he was a
[03:12:29.800 --> 03:12:35.320]  recruiter for the russians in japan during the cold war he would recruit chinese students
[03:12:35.320 --> 03:12:42.120]  and japanese until he was eventually caught and thrown out of japan ended up going back
[03:12:42.120 --> 03:12:47.560]  to russia and defecting to the united states in 2006 so you're going to learn things that you never
[03:12:47.560 --> 03:12:53.160]  even understood uh the way that the russian intelligence operates uh he's going to talk
[03:12:53.160 --> 03:12:59.080]  about the steel dossier uh whether that was even an intelligence document or just a big joke
[03:12:59.080 --> 03:13:04.440]  so constantan pribyzinski coming up you know alex right after the break and we look forward also to
[03:13:04.440 --> 03:13:10.280]  news night later to see what they're coming up with uh in in the school shooting uh i hope that
[03:13:10.280 --> 03:13:14.840]  oliver north who now is taking over the n r a i hope he does a much better job than this a guy uh
[03:13:16.120 --> 03:13:21.640]  lapierre always did a poor job i thought defending the n r a oliver north needs to come on and say
[03:13:21.640 --> 03:13:27.560]  listen n r a is even more important now we're about self-defense we're about gun safety and i
[03:13:27.560 --> 03:13:33.640]  hope i totally agree you know a lot of years not perfect not as good as heston but you say what you
[03:13:33.640 --> 03:13:39.000]  want about oliver north he's hardcore he says this is persecution of america attack on our
[03:13:39.000 --> 03:13:43.320]  basic rights and people trying to say get rid of our second amendment are terrorists because
[03:13:43.320 --> 03:13:47.800]  they're not engaging in free speech they're trying to repeal the bedrock of the country so
[03:13:47.800 --> 03:13:53.160]  i'm very excited about oliver north uh actually actually being there you know i used to interview
[03:13:53.160 --> 03:13:57.960]  him all the time and once got a bunch of negative questions for him and you know about about
[03:13:57.960 --> 03:14:01.480]  all the stuff that happened in central south america he said listen i'm not a traitor in my
[03:14:01.480 --> 03:14:05.560]  country i do what i was supposed to well i get that i was i was only asking hard questions but
[03:14:05.560 --> 03:14:09.640]  you know we now see the democrats had a whole plan to collapse all the way up to the us with
[03:14:09.640 --> 03:14:17.400]  communists and then collapse the us if communists have one thing they certainly think big uh they
[03:14:17.400 --> 03:14:23.240]  have an agenda which is complete it's the it represents the total domain it has so much in common with
[03:14:23.240 --> 03:14:29.880]  islamism uh islamists and leftists both have a passion for destruction they have a passion for
[03:14:29.880 --> 03:14:35.960]  taking over everything they have a passion for complete control of everyone's lives uh that's
[03:14:35.960 --> 03:14:41.960]  why we don't get the western ethos of renaissance that that explodes with productivity and success
[03:14:41.960 --> 03:14:44.840]  don't they get if you turn people loose that's what creates all the wealth
[03:14:44.840 --> 03:14:51.960]  they're still in denial they they cannot accept that their vision for the perfect world for utopia
[03:14:51.960 --> 03:14:57.640]  for making the world a better place with the government in control taking all your property
[03:14:58.520 --> 03:15:04.680]  giving out jobs and giving out money they cannot accept that their model for humanity
[03:15:05.560 --> 03:15:10.440]  is a complete disaster and they'll never go away that's why it's so important to keep educating
[03:15:10.440 --> 03:15:16.680]  people about the truth and reality of free markets versus uh this government controlled
[03:15:16.680 --> 03:15:22.040]  socialism which leads on a path to nowhere it creates a dystopia not a utopia like your film

[03:21:00.120 --> 03:21:05.320]  colonel an intelligence expert and author of several books including the spy who loved japan
[03:21:06.360 --> 03:21:13.000]  kgb new trojan horse and even a new book an american man's guide to russian women
[03:21:13.000 --> 03:21:20.440]  and uh i think if we understand russian women we can start talking about the mentality of the russians
[03:21:21.000 --> 03:21:26.440]  now some of you know constantan from his appearance in my film which is in the alex jones store also
[03:21:26.440 --> 03:21:32.280]  there's no place like utopia you know a place like utopia there he is and i think we can
[03:21:32.280 --> 03:21:40.120]  learn a lot from him uh talking to a former kgb colonel constantan zdrasovce welcome to info
[03:21:40.120 --> 03:21:46.680]  war zdrasovce nice to see you nice to see you again great to see you constantan first of all
[03:21:46.680 --> 03:21:53.080]  before we talk about the book what was your job in the kgb and uh what exactly did you do undercover
[03:21:53.080 --> 03:22:00.520]  and what was your cover in japan in japan um i was covered as the correspondent of the telegraph
[03:22:00.520 --> 03:22:07.240]  agency of the soviet union and my task was to spy on china mostly on china
[03:22:07.240 --> 03:22:13.400]  and how did you spy on china what did you do to recruit chinese students
[03:22:13.960 --> 03:22:19.800]  i just was recruiting them it was it's a great job i was looking for the chinese students
[03:22:20.680 --> 03:22:28.280]  made some personal contact with them usually i said that i need a personal tutor of chinese
[03:22:28.280 --> 03:22:37.720]  language they agreed and then they gave them uh 100 dollars for this lesson which is too much
[03:22:37.720 --> 03:22:44.360]  i the lesson took place in the restaurants luxurious restaurants at the time chinese students were
[03:22:44.360 --> 03:22:53.560]  very poor and i said mostly oh let's not do a lesson today let's postpone it for the next time
[03:22:53.560 --> 03:23:01.960]  but please take the honorarium it made our relations very just progress and then
[03:23:03.960 --> 03:23:13.160]  slowly but surely they became agents or collaborators of our intelligence it's the way
[03:23:13.160 --> 03:23:20.280]  all other intelligences are doing nothing new nothing special i see and you were eventually
[03:23:20.280 --> 03:23:26.520]  arrested and kicked out of japan is that correct what year was that yes it was 1985
[03:23:27.560 --> 03:23:39.160]  just i was going to meet just a chinese scholar whom i recruited but japanese police
[03:23:39.160 --> 03:23:48.280]  was waiting me in the place of our meeting instead of himself what occurred to him later i don't know
[03:23:48.280 --> 03:23:57.960]  i was forced to go to russia to moscow by my leadership by kgb maybe it was possible better
[03:23:57.960 --> 03:24:03.720]  to go to police and talk they explain or just hire a lawyer but in the soviet period it was
[03:24:03.720 --> 03:24:12.040]  impossible i had to surrender and fulfill what i was ordered to do okay konstantin so
[03:24:12.040 --> 03:24:17.080]  you are an expert and you've been very kind to explain to me the major differences in the
[03:24:17.080 --> 03:24:23.240]  mentality of russians versus american mentality and different ways of thinking completely on many
[03:24:23.240 --> 03:24:30.120]  issues so let's let's before we get into the politics let's take a look into the russian mind
[03:24:30.120 --> 03:24:36.360]  by talking about your book on uh an americans guide to russian women because we saw with the
[03:24:36.360 --> 03:24:42.440]  me too movement we saw for instance eric schneidermann the new york attorney general in the news
[03:24:42.440 --> 03:24:48.840]  this guy was completely corrupt he's suing climate deniers full-blown a progressive agenda
[03:24:48.840 --> 03:24:54.040]  it turns out schneidermann is a hypocrite and resigns when it's revealed that he abused women he
[03:24:54.040 --> 03:25:02.360]  dated so let's to start understanding the russian mentality let's talk about your book an americans
[03:25:02.360 --> 03:25:08.280]  guide to russian women before we talk about the politics now the first chapter is titled sexual
[03:25:08.280 --> 03:25:17.320]  harassment please explain why russian women want to be sexually harassed because their mind totally
[03:25:17.320 --> 03:25:27.880]  differs uh just in russia sexual harassment uh is following when a beat woman tried try to rape her
[03:25:27.880 --> 03:25:33.560]  leave some scars uh which can be proved that is sexual harassment in russia nothing more
[03:25:33.560 --> 03:25:43.640]  and if you give woman some pleasant addresses if you say how beautiful she is how beautiful is
[03:25:43.640 --> 03:25:50.120]  her breast uh and kisses her hand and puts her hand on her knee it's not sexual harassment at all
[03:25:50.120 --> 03:26:00.680]  it's very pleasant it's normal flirt with the woman in russia when a boss uh just uh or expresses
[03:26:00.680 --> 03:26:08.920]  some sexual interest into his female subordinate she's happy because traditionally uh there is
[03:26:08.920 --> 03:26:17.160]  lack of men in russia and women are starving for men's attention so just i would advise american
[03:26:17.160 --> 03:26:24.040]  men to marry russian women they will never accuse you of sexual harassment okay well you said also
[03:26:24.040 --> 03:26:30.600]  in the book russian women are tired of feminism why is that uh because uh in fact there is very
[03:26:30.600 --> 03:26:37.960]  few feminists in russia in russia when a woman says that she's a feminist are we laughing at her
[03:26:37.960 --> 03:26:43.000]  saying oh you're a good boyfriend get a good boyfriend and all your feminists will go out
[03:26:44.600 --> 03:26:51.080]  traditionally russian women are worshiping men uh respecting men in russia for example it is
[03:26:51.080 --> 03:26:58.680]  impossible for a wife to accuse her husband in rape so so called rape and sex there is no such
[03:26:58.680 --> 03:27:04.920]  law in russia why so because russian common vice says the following you have married your husband
[03:27:04.920 --> 03:27:12.120]  you need to give him some pleasure if you don't do this what kind of wife are you so why do you
[03:27:12.120 --> 03:27:17.000]  also said russian women actually want to be the weaker sex not equal where does that come from
[03:27:17.000 --> 03:27:24.520]  uh yes it it comes from our soviet history uh in 1917 as you know uh there was a revolution
[03:27:24.520 --> 03:27:32.440]  in the soviet union and uh according to the the ideology of newcomers the communists um men and
[03:27:32.440 --> 03:27:41.640]  women became the same were declared the same women were forced to to to do a hard man's job
[03:27:41.640 --> 03:27:49.320]  especially during the war uh second world war when many men died after the war so just when
[03:27:49.320 --> 03:27:56.680]  communist period um finished they wanted to return to what it was before the revolution
[03:27:56.680 --> 03:28:02.840]  when men were kissing women's hands when they were putting quotes on their shoulders when they were
[03:28:02.840 --> 03:28:11.880]  just go telling them go just go ahead as a lady but since the time for the hundred years the world
[03:28:11.880 --> 03:28:17.320]  world has changed in europe and the west men are not kissing hands to women anymore and not
[03:28:18.280 --> 03:28:23.400]  putting quotes on their shoulders and russian women feel very much disappointed with this
[03:28:23.400 --> 03:28:31.160]  they want to be women okay well you're starting to give us a good insight into the russian history

[03:33:42.680 --> 03:33:53.000]  questions later in the show it's going to be 1877789 alex 1877892539 uh we want to talk now with
[03:33:53.000 --> 03:34:00.680]  constantin about the sanctions against russia uh i understand alexander lid venenko was murdered in
[03:34:00.680 --> 03:34:08.920]  london in 2006 he was poisoned was he a friend of yours yes we never met but we were speaking a lot
[03:34:08.920 --> 03:34:15.640]  over the phone uh yes he was friend of mine and i was very sorry when he died yes when he was poisoned
[03:34:16.440 --> 03:34:21.960]  was he in fear that he would be killed and was he worried that the kgb was going to try to get rid
[03:34:21.960 --> 03:34:28.040]  of him yes he was telling me that he was afraid of course he uh foresaw it to some extent he told
[03:34:28.040 --> 03:34:35.160]  me that he was afraid why didn't uh pudin or the russians just forgive him and forget about him
[03:34:35.160 --> 03:34:41.480]  tell me about the mentality of the russians why wouldn't they just give up on him on him on
[03:34:41.480 --> 03:34:52.120]  lid venenko yes uh well lid venenko was very active uh in media he was talking a lot about pudin uh
[03:34:52.120 --> 03:34:59.240]  some a lot of negative information maybe he has irritated him so just at that time he was not
[03:34:59.240 --> 03:35:05.800]  keeping silence and was very very active in his public uh writings and maybe speaking
[03:35:05.800 --> 03:35:13.400]  well we just had the poisoning in england of the x5 surge skripal and that resulted in sanctions
[03:35:13.400 --> 03:35:19.960]  being placed by england united states and other allies what effect the do sanctions have on the
[03:35:19.960 --> 03:35:26.840]  russian people and on putin are they afraid of sanctions i don't know i don't know but i have
[03:35:26.840 --> 03:35:35.720]  too far from this problem but sovitin has always been living under these are those uh these are that
[03:35:35.720 --> 03:35:42.840]  kind of sanctions remember the section of skokom soldiers is something uh naturals something
[03:35:42.840 --> 03:35:51.160]  not new at all for russians uh to say afraid or not usually russians are not so much afraid of
[03:35:51.160 --> 03:35:59.080]  an exterior threat and does it make russian history does does it make putin more popular
[03:35:59.080 --> 03:36:06.040]  or less popular when they have sanctions oh i don't know but judging by russian media it makes
[03:36:06.040 --> 03:36:14.200]  more popular yes i see things the russians have does the russian does russia the russian government
[03:36:14.200 --> 03:36:20.520]  have the same concept in russia of forgiveness as we have in the west and in america would they
[03:36:20.520 --> 03:36:24.200]  forgive and forget about someone who's a traitor or do they always remember
[03:36:26.120 --> 03:36:33.800]  but i don't know about such a conception such a concept for forgiveness here i don't know
[03:36:33.800 --> 03:36:40.280]  as there's nothing to compare with so but i have no comment about this respect i don't
[03:36:40.280 --> 03:36:47.160]  know this problem at all okay let's talk about the steel dossier that i think i sent you and
[03:36:47.160 --> 03:36:52.520]  uh this is the dossier with the information that they're used against trump to obtain phisa warrants
[03:36:52.520 --> 03:36:58.920]  and spy on the trump campaign uh you told me it was just foolish speculation why wasn't this
[03:36:59.800 --> 03:37:05.480]  something that was not a uh intelligence document uh why was it taken seriously and what did you
[03:37:05.480 --> 03:37:12.280]  think about it i as far as i remember it shows me right there is only speculations no direct
[03:37:12.280 --> 03:37:20.200]  facts no direct facts no just um some secret facts only the open information so i didn't
[03:37:20.200 --> 03:37:26.040]  take it seriously it looks like speculation i was even laughing uh when i was reading it
[03:37:27.720 --> 03:37:35.720]  okay and you wrote the book called new trojan horse about uh americans of russian descent
[03:37:35.720 --> 03:37:43.000]  uh especially working in the russian orthodox church uh did the cold war actually end
[03:37:43.720 --> 03:37:49.000]  and what is the extent of russian influence in the us today i don't know what is the extent
[03:37:49.000 --> 03:37:55.000]  of russian influence today in this country because i don't know i am not just dwelling the
[03:37:55.800 --> 03:38:02.120]  life of a public person i'm not visiting press conferences and and so on uh but um
[03:38:02.120 --> 03:38:09.400]  um of course traditionally there is there always has been some influence what about russian orthodox
[03:38:09.400 --> 03:38:17.800]  church now russia is the country which is emphasizing christianity it's very characteristic
[03:38:17.800 --> 03:38:25.960]  for russian for russian mind too is christian for example um i might give you a very interesting
[03:38:25.960 --> 03:38:34.840]  episode regarding this combination ktb maybe practice ktb mind and russian orthodox valis
[03:38:34.840 --> 03:38:43.800]  whenever ktb school over 40 years ago um we were asked the following question what will you do
[03:38:43.800 --> 03:38:51.160]  if your father turns out to be a foreign spy and i said i will try to stop somehow his spying
[03:38:51.160 --> 03:38:57.160]  but i will never betray my father i will never report to the authorities about his espionage
[03:38:57.160 --> 03:39:03.320]  because parents are more important than law more important than state because law can be
[03:39:03.320 --> 03:39:12.040]  mistaken laws are taken by maybe sinful and mortal people who can be bribed deceived and so on
[03:39:12.040 --> 03:39:20.040]  but parents are given to you by lord you did not vote for you want visit parents and my answer
[03:39:20.040 --> 03:39:30.920]  did not bring any help to me so just in russia okay let's play uh let's play i want to get your
[03:39:30.920 --> 03:39:37.880]  comment on the video of obama talking to medvedev let's play that for for uh about 30 seconds this
[03:39:37.880 --> 03:39:42.760]  is obama telling medvedev that he'll be more flexible after the election and i want to know
[03:39:42.760 --> 03:40:00.600]  what's going on here a few months ago when you were asked what's the biggest geopolitical
[03:40:00.600 --> 03:40:07.160]  threat facing america you said russia not al-qaeda you said russia in the 1980s are now calling
[03:40:07.160 --> 03:40:13.400]  to ask for their foreign policy back because okay let's cut the let's cut the video that's good
[03:40:13.400 --> 03:40:20.120]  first of all what was going on here with obama talking to medvedev obama is a pro-russian voice
[03:40:20.120 --> 03:40:24.920]  in american government were there pro-russian voices and are there in the kremlin and what is
[03:40:24.920 --> 03:40:33.080]  obama up to here with medvedev and i think as a former as a former just consultant advisor
[03:40:33.080 --> 03:40:37.800]  in intelligence mostly on china but also was a speech writer to the head of our
[03:40:37.800 --> 03:40:43.160]  scientific and technical intelligence this short talk is not enough to make any conclusion
[03:40:44.200 --> 03:40:50.920]  as far as i know the situation in these high spheres is changing so quickly so drastically
[03:40:50.920 --> 03:40:56.760]  that one episode mostly doesn't mean anything we don't know the surrounding circumstances
[03:40:56.760 --> 03:41:05.000]  it's too few information just a piece of sand drop of sand of information which is not enough
[03:41:05.720 --> 03:41:13.240]  for to make any conclusions well do you have pro are there pro-american pro-american voices in the
[03:41:13.240 --> 03:41:19.000]  kremlin today like we have with obama that was pro-russia when he was in office are there pro-american
[03:41:19.000 --> 03:41:24.680]  supporters i i don't know of course but i think then today's in today's general there are no such
[03:41:24.680 --> 03:41:31.960]  people and i and yes and they were but now they are not it's politics of today's russia
[03:41:32.760 --> 03:41:38.120]  as far as i know but because i have no special information and no direct facts i have been
[03:41:38.120 --> 03:41:46.760]  separated from all that kind of reality okay what do you see in today's a democrat party in america
[03:41:46.760 --> 03:41:52.600]  where they're going more and more toward socialist and communist point of view what are they missing
[03:41:52.600 --> 03:42:01.080]  in terms of understanding the reality of socialism oh it's i don't know it either i'm just separated
[03:42:01.080 --> 03:42:07.320]  socialism uh just uh i have a feeling that socialism is now reviving the whole world
[03:42:07.320 --> 03:42:14.760]  but i don't know enough facts about it if this problem should be uh studied but as a historian
[03:42:14.760 --> 03:42:19.800]  i'm my first first profession history i am especially japanese history and language but in
[03:42:19.800 --> 03:42:27.880]  the world history too as a historian i feel that socialism is coming back the the age of democracy
[03:42:27.880 --> 03:42:35.000]  is finishing many people think so too but i have no facts to prove it so let us see let's me uh
[03:42:38.280 --> 03:42:42.360]  okay well look we'll be right back with some more you got any questions for constant it's

[03:47:36.520 --> 03:47:41.320]  welcome back to the alex jones show this is info wars i'm joel gilbert coming to you again right
[03:47:41.320 --> 03:47:47.640]  from the left coast don't forget to get my new dvd trump the art of the insult in the alex jones
[03:47:47.640 --> 03:47:52.840]  info wars store uh we're still talking with former kgb lieutenant colonel constantin pre
[03:47:52.840 --> 03:47:59.240]  bajinsky uh constantin what can you tell us about the way of thinking of latimer putin
[03:47:59.240 --> 03:48:08.360]  what are his values and how does he approach statecraft well i don't know but as he just
[03:48:08.360 --> 03:48:19.080]  of the same age with me he is only one year older and we have passed almost the same part of our
[03:48:19.080 --> 03:48:28.200]  biography i think maybe i could could understand him well just why russian people are supporting him
[03:48:28.200 --> 03:48:35.640]  because he's he's devoting himself to a national interest of russia which most of the soviet
[03:48:35.640 --> 03:48:45.400]  leaders did not do for example lenin was devoted to um the world communism Stalin yes he just uh
[03:48:45.400 --> 03:48:53.880]  was very uh just in the very patriotic and nationalistic though he was a very cruel person but still
[03:48:53.880 --> 03:49:01.000]  russian people respect him because he has done something for the soviet union uh to in order
[03:49:01.000 --> 03:49:07.960]  to make this country very strong and uh what about other leaders khrushchev he was just a weak reader
[03:49:08.680 --> 03:49:14.520]  he was also thinking about communism but not about his country the same about brezhnev uh
[03:49:14.520 --> 03:49:21.720]  the same about gorbachev uh yeltsin was a very weak um leader and he was doing nothing for his
[03:49:21.720 --> 03:49:29.000]  for his country that's why i think russian people are supporting putin is putin someone who
[03:49:29.000 --> 03:49:37.880]  supports traditional values over he is of course he has as far as i know as far as i read he has
[03:49:37.880 --> 03:49:48.680]  proclaimed the preservation of traditional family values russia's what is it about the
[03:49:48.680 --> 03:49:54.760]  russian mentality the russian political worldview that you think americans and the american government
[03:49:54.760 --> 03:50:05.160]  don't understand uh just america and russia uh fortunately unfortunately in the nation psychology
[03:50:05.160 --> 03:50:12.920]  very far from each other uh because um russia and state russia as a country was formed by russian
[03:50:12.920 --> 03:50:21.480]  orthodox church if there was no uh baptism of russia in kiv by prince vladimir uh there was no
[03:50:21.480 --> 03:50:28.120]  russia there would be no russia america uh was founded by protestants and protestants mine
[03:50:28.120 --> 03:50:35.320]  protestants mine and and orthodox minds are very far from each other for example in america if you
[03:50:35.320 --> 03:50:42.440]  have a lot of money you're respected in russia you're most disrespect like all our oligarchs
[03:50:43.320 --> 03:50:51.160]  in america if you have a lot of money people think say that oh a thing says that god loves him
[03:50:51.160 --> 03:50:57.400]  in russia in russia in the same situation uh we say oh it's devil to be a bit tempting him
[03:50:57.400 --> 03:51:05.640]  maybe this money uh will uh gained notice in the quite just way so uh so called which
[03:51:05.640 --> 03:51:14.520]  so called values are very much different and one more thing um russia has suffered a foreign
[03:51:14.520 --> 03:51:23.160]  occupation uh has suffered wars in some territory for very many times for hundreds of years america
[03:51:23.160 --> 03:51:30.120]  has never suffered enemy in its own territory it makes some it brings some nuances uh of difference
[03:51:30.120 --> 03:51:37.160]  some different nuances in understanding war by russians and americans okay i want to ask you
[03:51:37.160 --> 03:51:42.200]  about uh russia's alliance with iran let's take a quick look at an excerpt from the art of the
[03:51:42.200 --> 03:51:48.520]  insult donald trump talking about the iran deal during the uh campaign well i don't know we're
[03:51:48.520 --> 03:51:54.920]  making a deal with iran and we're fighting iran in yemen when you make the deal aren't you supposed
[03:51:54.920 --> 03:52:00.440]  to sort of solve everything i mean here's a guy goes on a bicycle to go on a bicycle race he's 73
[03:52:00.440 --> 03:52:06.200]  years old he's in a bicycle and he's got all this stuff on he's got the whole deal the company's
[03:52:06.200 --> 03:52:11.400]  the whole deal the helmet a quick spin through the swiss alps following negotiations on iran's
[03:52:11.400 --> 03:52:20.520]  nuclear policy went awry for u.s secretary of state john carrey police he falls he breaks his leg
[03:52:20.520 --> 03:52:25.960]  during the negotiation i swear to you i will never be in a bicycle race as long as i'm present
[03:52:29.400 --> 03:52:36.040]  okay konstantin what is the uh traditional relationship between uh russia and iran they've
[03:52:36.040 --> 03:52:43.400]  helped them build uh nuclear uh you know plants in in iran and they support them in the middle east
[03:52:43.400 --> 03:52:51.480]  what is the connection from the time that you were in the kgb till today uh speaking more
[03:52:51.480 --> 03:53:01.240]  generally russia and iran simply has maintained very long uh relations for a very long period
[03:53:01.240 --> 03:53:09.080]  of history maybe for south for uh thousand years while russia is existing if you go to the muslim
[03:53:09.080 --> 03:53:19.800]  kremlin to his armor chamber the museum of ancient weapons and ancient just um jubilee you will see
[03:53:19.800 --> 03:53:26.920]  the presence by iranian sharks and russian kings to russians one dating back to maybe
[03:53:26.920 --> 03:53:34.840]  11th to 11th 14th century so this the history of russian and persian iranian relations is very
[03:53:34.840 --> 03:53:43.800]  long it was not so friendly of course but what about today i don't know about his this um just
[03:53:44.600 --> 03:53:54.200]  iranian involvement in atomic weapons because i'm not informed about that but still the very
[03:53:54.200 --> 03:54:00.200]  fact that russia and iran are very very long partners long time partners it tells of course
[03:54:00.200 --> 03:54:06.840]  it brings some influence into their relations today okay and finally let's talk about the uh
[03:54:06.840 --> 03:54:13.480]  the muller probe uh investigating donald trump based on this russian influence uh dossier
[03:54:13.480 --> 03:54:20.520]  how do you think uh the kremlin putin feel about this investigation are they upset that they're
[03:54:20.520 --> 03:54:26.360]  the subject of investigation for interfering in elections or are they laughing every day when they
[03:54:26.360 --> 03:54:33.560]  see uh the american government under such siege based on this whole theory of russians getting
[03:54:33.560 --> 03:54:37.240]  involved with the trump campaign how are they looking at this from their point of view do you
[03:54:37.240 --> 03:54:42.760]  think uh of course they can only guess can only guess of course because they don't don't don't
[03:54:42.760 --> 03:54:51.240]  know anything but maybe they laugh too because uh it is normal work of just of intelligence um just
[03:54:51.240 --> 03:55:01.080]  so just um i think their reaction may be very different kinds uh but still uh one can say that
[03:55:02.760 --> 03:55:10.600]  some reaction some reflection of this reality in kremlin is very serious today kremlin and russian
[03:55:10.600 --> 03:55:19.160]  general has got very uh very skilled uh specialist in many countries i feel it it was the soviet
[03:55:19.160 --> 03:55:26.920]  unit it was not so so today specials in america uh in japan and china the russians ones are better
[03:55:26.920 --> 03:55:36.120]  than they were in the soviet period okay uh let's take one call from uh dr kelly in uh
[03:55:36.120 --> 03:55:41.720]  northern california has one question for constantin go ahead uh dr kelly hey thank you so much for
[03:55:41.720 --> 03:55:48.040]  taking my call and for all of your work um i discovered a copy of the king james bible
[03:55:48.600 --> 03:55:55.400]  translated into russian and during times of high tension over the last three or four years
[03:55:55.960 --> 03:56:03.160]  i would pray and fast and put this on and listen to it and hope that if anyone else was listening
[03:56:03.160 --> 03:56:10.600]  that they could hear it too and i really uh appreciate the efforts of our countries to
[03:56:10.600 --> 03:56:18.440]  befriend each other you know we're brothers um and that we are one nation under god indivisible
[03:56:18.440 --> 03:56:23.800]  okay thank you thank you for the call constantin is russia becoming more religious and going back
[03:56:23.800 --> 03:56:29.320]  more toward traditional values while america is becoming less traditional and more socialist
[03:56:29.320 --> 03:56:37.640]  yes russia i don't know about america because i'm not so much deep in israel but russia really
[03:56:37.640 --> 03:56:44.600]  is returning to christianity which is a great contradiction uh with europe with west in general
[03:56:45.480 --> 03:56:55.560]  so i think it's it determines the way of thinking of russians and i can feel it reading russian
[03:56:55.560 --> 03:57:04.440]  media the christian approach to the world yes it is really something vital something important
[03:57:04.440 --> 03:57:11.320]  for russians today it's almost as if the all the work during the cold war where the kgb was trying
[03:57:11.320 --> 03:57:20.200]  to infiltrate and influence the left in america to cause america to be uh more socialist worked
[03:57:20.200 --> 03:57:26.120]  and america's influence during the cold war to cause russia to be more traditional that also
[03:57:26.120 --> 03:57:31.320]  worked so we're switching roles it's very fascinating uh good no constantin prevegencki thank you so
