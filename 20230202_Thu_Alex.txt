[00:00.000 --> 00:20.000]  Infowars, the most banned network in the world.
[00:30.000 --> 00:36.000]  It's Thursday, February 2nd, 2023.
[00:36.000 --> 00:43.000]  And we are going to clear the decks of guests today and take massive amounts of your phone calls
[00:43.000 --> 00:51.000]  on five big subjects I'm going to be announcing and covering in the first 30 minutes of the broadcast.
[00:51.000 --> 00:54.000]  It's all incredibly important, obviously.
[00:54.000 --> 01:02.000]  We have a Pentagon document that's been released. It's a public Pentagon plan to take over the brains of the American people.
[01:02.000 --> 01:08.000]  In cognitive security, you must be mind-controlled to give you security. There must not be any freedom.
[01:08.000 --> 01:13.000]  Totally tyrannical, absolutely authoritarian, totalitarian. We're going to be hitting that.
[01:13.000 --> 01:20.000]  Putin is preparing massive assault with 500,000 men on two fronts.
[01:20.000 --> 01:24.000]  And it looks like it's going to happen sometime in the next three weeks,
[01:24.000 --> 01:28.000]  in or around the anniversary of the attack that was launched last year.
[01:28.000 --> 01:35.000]  I agree with that analysis and concur with that information.
[01:35.000 --> 01:37.000]  That's all coming up.
[01:37.000 --> 01:43.000]  We have the great reset, not just in Europe or Australia or the UK, but here,
[01:43.000 --> 01:51.000]  banning your fireplaces, banning your gas-powered stoves and more, your cows, everything, big stack on that,
[01:51.000 --> 01:56.000]  and so much more here today. You do not want to miss any of this broadcast.
[01:56.000 --> 01:59.000]  But first, I want to play with Tucker Carlson earlier in the week.
[01:59.000 --> 02:02.000]  He pointed out, if we're going to try to liberate authoritarian countries,
[02:02.000 --> 02:06.000]  peoples like North Korea or whatever, how about we liberate Canada?
[02:06.000 --> 02:09.000]  He's been criticized for it. Here's the clip.
[02:09.000 --> 02:13.000]  We're talking to our friend David Azarad recently for an interview on Fox Nation,
[02:13.000 --> 02:15.000]  and the topic of Canada came up.
[02:15.000 --> 02:20.000]  David Azarad was born and raised in Montreal, but like a lot of ambitious and freedom-loving people,
[02:20.000 --> 02:22.000]  he fled later to the United States.
[02:22.000 --> 02:26.000]  And because all the people who care about their own rights have left,
[02:26.000 --> 02:30.000]  Canada under Justin Trudeau has become effectively a dictatorship.
[02:30.000 --> 02:34.000]  And we don't like dictatorships. We're America. We liberate dictatorships.
[02:34.000 --> 02:37.000]  That's what we do.
[02:37.000 --> 02:41.000]  And we ask the obvious question, why don't we just liberate Canada?
[02:41.000 --> 02:43.000]  Here's that conversation.
[02:43.000 --> 02:46.000]  Why should we stand back and let our biggest trading partner,
[02:46.000 --> 02:49.000]  the country with which we share the longest border,
[02:49.000 --> 02:51.000]  and actually, I could just say, a great country. I love Canada.
[02:51.000 --> 02:53.000]  I've always loved Canada because of its natural beauty.
[02:53.000 --> 02:55.000]  Why should we let it become Cuba?
[02:55.000 --> 03:00.000]  Why don't we liberate it? We're spending all this money to liberate Ukraine from the Russians.
[03:00.000 --> 03:03.000]  Why are we not sending an armed force north to liberate Canada from Trudeau?
[03:03.000 --> 03:04.000]  And I mean it.
[03:04.000 --> 03:07.000]  Well, I don't know that you don't have to answer that.
[03:07.000 --> 03:10.000]  I don't know that I'm there yet with you.
[03:10.000 --> 03:13.000]  I'm just talking to myself and my friends here.
[03:13.000 --> 03:17.000]  It's a fair question. And honestly, we thought the Canadians would be flattered
[03:17.000 --> 03:20.000]  because they're always flattered when you talk about them.
[03:20.000 --> 03:22.000]  They're like stalkers. You don't know they exist,
[03:22.000 --> 03:25.000]  but they've got pictures of you in their dorm room.
[03:25.000 --> 03:29.000]  So if you do a Canada joke on TV, they go absolutely crazy.
[03:29.000 --> 03:32.000]  They don't really know how to handle it or what it means,
[03:32.000 --> 03:34.000]  but it doesn't matter. They're excited.
[03:34.000 --> 03:37.000]  And that's true even in the Canadian Parliament.
[03:37.000 --> 03:42.000]  Apparently, there's so little going on in Canada, like civil liberties,
[03:42.000 --> 03:45.000]  that if you tell a joke about Canada, they go bonkers.
[03:45.000 --> 03:47.000]  Watch this Canadian, quote, member of parliament
[03:47.000 --> 03:51.000]  trying to get some kind of resolution pass condemning this show.
[03:53.000 --> 03:56.000]  Mr. Speaker, after consultation with the parties in the House,
[03:56.000 --> 04:01.000]  if you seek it, I believe you will find unanimous consent for the following motion.
[04:01.000 --> 04:05.000]  That given the rise of far-right and associated violent extremism
[04:05.000 --> 04:08.000]  led to the attempted insurrection in the United States,
[04:08.000 --> 04:13.000]  the House condemns recent comments made by Fox News personality
[04:13.000 --> 04:17.000]  Tucker Carlson in which he suggests U.S. armed forces
[04:17.000 --> 04:21.000]  liberate Canada from the current prime minister.
[04:22.000 --> 04:28.000]  All those opposed to the honorable member moving the motion will please say nay.
[04:28.000 --> 04:33.000]  Nay, I'm afraid we don't have unanimous consent.
[04:34.000 --> 04:38.000]  By the way, it failed, and we don't want to be too picky-oon or anything,
[04:38.000 --> 04:42.000]  but we did not suggest the armed forces liberate Canada.
[04:42.000 --> 04:45.000]  You're flattering yourself, Canadian member of parliament.
[04:45.000 --> 04:47.000]  We wouldn't need the armed forces.
[04:47.000 --> 04:50.000]  A couple of your college roommates just ran up the sled dogs
[04:50.000 --> 04:52.000]  and you wouldn't be able to move.
[04:52.000 --> 04:55.000]  We're not actually going to do it just yet.
[04:55.000 --> 04:57.000]  There's something to think about. Settle down.
[04:57.000 --> 04:59.000]  Well, he jerked her chain.
[05:00.000 --> 05:02.000]  Well, I have fantastic stuff.
[05:02.000 --> 05:05.000]  Diet force? Diet force is amazing.
[05:05.000 --> 05:07.000]  I'm 45 and I have bits.
[05:07.000 --> 05:10.000]  I go to the gym and I have bits that won't move.
[05:10.000 --> 05:14.000]  And diet force has helped me move those bits.
[05:14.000 --> 05:17.000]  Under my pecs, my belly.
[05:17.000 --> 05:20.000]  I'm just taking diet force two tablets a day.
[05:20.000 --> 05:25.000]  Man, if you're struggling to get my chip shape for the ladies,
[05:25.000 --> 05:28.000]  mate, diet force is the go.
[05:28.000 --> 05:32.000]  You have to get the diet force and have two a day and just keep active.
[05:32.000 --> 05:35.000]  InfoWarsStore.com, X7 diet force.
[05:35.000 --> 05:38.000]  InfoWarsStore.com, baby.

[05:40.000 --> 05:42.000]  We're cutting that call into an ad.

[05:43.000 --> 05:45.000]  Thank you so much for the call, Grant.
[05:45.000 --> 05:46.000]  God bless Australia.
[05:46.000 --> 05:48.000]  We'll be right back, folks. Don't go anywhere.
[05:48.000 --> 05:55.000]  InfoWarsStore.com, diet force. Get it now.
[06:18.000 --> 06:33.000]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center
[06:33.000 --> 06:36.000]  in the heart of the Resistance.
[06:36.000 --> 06:39.000]  You're listening to Alex Jones.
[06:39.000 --> 06:43.000]  It's Thursday, February 2nd.
[06:43.000 --> 06:49.000]  The year is 2023 and we are hurdling through deep space
[06:49.000 --> 06:54.000]  on this gorgeous planet into an unknown future.
[06:54.000 --> 06:56.000]  Thank you so much for joining us.
[06:56.000 --> 07:01.000]  We're going to take calls for the entire broadcast today.
[07:01.000 --> 07:05.000]  The entire broadcast after I hit a lot of this news and interspersed
[07:05.000 --> 07:09.000]  throughout your phone calls, I'll be covering breaking news and information.
[07:09.000 --> 07:15.000]  Here's what we have for you and there is quite a lot to say the least.
[07:15.000 --> 07:21.000]  Incredible Stockholm syndrome from people hurt by the poison shots,
[07:21.000 --> 07:28.000]  trying to blame all their new illnesses on something else like the weather or
[07:28.000 --> 07:32.000]  maybe perhaps the common colds making them of our heart attacks.
[07:32.000 --> 07:34.000]  We've got that big stack of news.
[07:34.000 --> 07:39.000]  We have Putin preparing a massive 500,000-plus troop invasion
[07:39.000 --> 07:42.000]  in or around the anniversary of the 24th of this month.
[07:42.000 --> 07:47.000]  We're going to get to that World War III looming information.
[07:47.000 --> 07:53.000]  I've got a big stack right over here on mind control that we're going to be getting to.
[07:53.000 --> 07:59.000]  As the Pentagon puts out a public report, DOD adds cognitive security.
[07:59.000 --> 08:05.000]  That means control of your brain to governmental disinformation campaign.
[08:05.000 --> 08:11.000]  And of course, we'll break down who's programming that and what this campaign plans to do.
[08:11.000 --> 08:15.000]  We're already deep into it, but now they're going public with it.
[08:15.000 --> 08:17.000]  Also, great reset.
[08:17.000 --> 08:24.000]  Britain's face 3,300 pound fines, up to 3,000 pound fines,
[08:24.000 --> 08:29.000]  for burning wood to keep warm.
[08:29.000 --> 08:31.000]  And you're like, well, that's over in the UK.
[08:31.000 --> 08:32.000]  No.
[08:32.000 --> 08:37.000]  Already dozens of cities have banned fireplaces and wood stoves as well.
[08:37.000 --> 08:39.000]  And that ties into a bunch.
[08:39.000 --> 08:42.000]  Your mother, June of 2030, cut off the power information.
[08:42.000 --> 08:47.000]  Christian mother is suing school for forcing four-year-old son to take part in Gay Pride Parade.
[08:47.000 --> 08:50.000]  And what that's all really tied into.
[08:50.000 --> 08:53.000]  Some very important free energy news that's breaking.
[08:53.000 --> 08:57.000]  Hunter Biden now claims laptop from hell was stolen.
[08:57.000 --> 08:58.000]  And he's the victim.
[08:58.000 --> 09:07.000]  And Democrats are saying they are looking to charge those that reported the Chinese espionage and pedophilia that are on the laptop.
[09:07.000 --> 09:16.000]  Paul Joseph Watson breaks down so-called immigrants or invaders in the UK given free debit cards and housing.
[09:16.000 --> 09:26.000]  GOP represent ship Roy exonerates Dems for refusing to condemn socialism and opposing the pledge of allegiance.
[09:26.000 --> 09:29.000]  We're going to be getting to that report.
[09:29.000 --> 09:35.000]  Jordan Peterson weighing in after meeting with Benjamin Netanyahu five weeks ago,
[09:35.000 --> 09:41.000]  having him on the show and having dinner with him now wants to attack Iran and tells Americans get behind it,
[09:41.000 --> 09:45.000]  even though Jordan Peterson is not an American.
[09:45.000 --> 09:54.000]  Why don't you go try to get the Canadians to attack somebody and start World War III, Mr. Military Man.
[09:54.000 --> 09:58.000]  That's just some of what we're going to be breaking down today.
[09:58.000 --> 10:00.000]  A lot of news on the economy and more.
[10:00.000 --> 10:05.000]  But really the big news is I'm going to take a massive amount of your phone calls.
[10:05.000 --> 10:11.000]  We had a lot of incredible callers yesterday and I intend to give the number out at the bottom of the hour
[10:11.000 --> 10:17.000]  to cover any of the subjects that I am raising here that I'm about to plow through right now.
[10:17.000 --> 10:20.000]  But first, let's talk about who to invade.
[10:20.000 --> 10:28.000]  Chuck Carlson on Monday put out one of his Fox Nation podcast interviews.
[10:28.000 --> 10:30.000]  And he was interviewing guests and said,
[10:30.000 --> 10:36.000]  they were always going to invade countries to liberate them, supposedly.
[10:36.000 --> 10:39.000]  Why don't we invade Canada to liberate them?
[10:39.000 --> 10:41.000]  It was a joke. It was tongue-in-cheek.
[10:41.000 --> 10:46.000]  The Canadian parliament's now calling for investigations and decrying the plan to invade Canada,
[10:46.000 --> 10:49.000]  even though it's the Chinese communists that are basically taking it over
[10:49.000 --> 10:52.000]  and have 10,000 troops drilling there at any one time.
[10:52.000 --> 10:53.000]  But oh, no, no, no.
[10:53.000 --> 10:54.000]  Tucker Carlson was planning that.
[10:54.000 --> 10:58.000]  But when we pull back, who's really supporting dictatorship?
[10:58.000 --> 11:06.000]  I've got clips right here of Democrats like Hakim Jeffries opposing a congressional resolution
[11:06.000 --> 11:11.000]  condemning brutal and corrupt socialist dictators, some of them unelected,
[11:11.000 --> 11:17.000]  who undermined, he said it would undermine the House Democrats' agenda to criticize them.
[11:17.000 --> 11:20.000]  So obviously, we're not really saying invade Canada.
[11:20.000 --> 11:24.000]  We're pointing out, I'm pointing out, Tucker's pointing out, you're pointing out,
[11:24.000 --> 11:28.000]  that they are in a national emergency, that they're banning free speech,
[11:28.000 --> 11:32.000]  that they're banning demonstrations, that they're spying on their political opposition,
[11:32.000 --> 11:35.000]  that they're grabbing people's bank accounts, that they're doing everything,
[11:35.000 --> 11:40.000]  that it's a talentarian regime, or a basic dictatorship would do.
[11:40.000 --> 11:47.000]  And remember, Justin Trudeau was elected, Jacinda Arden was elected,
[11:47.000 --> 11:49.000]  Adolf Hitler was elected.
[11:49.000 --> 11:54.000]  Just because you're elected doesn't mean you then can't establish a dictatorship.
[11:54.000 --> 11:59.000]  Doesn't mean you can't even leave office, but leave a deep state,
[11:59.000 --> 12:01.000]  bureaucratic dictatorship in place.
[12:01.000 --> 12:02.000]  And that's really what America has.
[12:02.000 --> 12:04.000]  That's why I raised this point.
[12:04.000 --> 12:06.000]  Canada needs liberating.
[12:06.000 --> 12:08.000]  The United States of America needs liberating.
[12:08.000 --> 12:11.000]  Scotland and Ireland and England need liberating.
[12:11.000 --> 12:13.000]  The U.K. is the only place under tyranny.
[12:13.000 --> 12:15.000]  Germany is under tyranny.
[12:15.000 --> 12:16.000]  France is under tyranny.
[12:16.000 --> 12:18.000]  The Netherlands are under tyranny.
[12:18.000 --> 12:21.000]  You can basically go to any western country, Australia, New Zealand, you name it,
[12:21.000 --> 12:26.000]  and the leaders are on TV promoting classical, basic dictatorship.
[12:26.000 --> 12:29.000]  Do I need to play the clip of Trudeau again saying,
[12:29.000 --> 12:31.000]  I admire Xi Jinping and communist China.
[12:31.000 --> 12:33.000]  I want to be like their communist dictatorship.
[12:33.000 --> 12:36.000]  Do I need to play Jacinda Arden and the rest of them saying,
[12:36.000 --> 12:38.000]  don't leave your house and if you don't take the shot,
[12:38.000 --> 12:41.000]  we're going to hunt you down and make you take it.
[12:41.000 --> 12:47.000]  You can't get more totalitarian, not just authoritarian,
[12:47.000 --> 12:50.000]  than taking over people's bodies and trying to lock them in their houses
[12:50.000 --> 12:51.000]  and control their lives.
[12:51.000 --> 12:55.000]  But the Pentagon tells us what the next step is in locking us in our houses,
[12:55.000 --> 12:58.000]  the forced metaverse.
[12:58.000 --> 13:00.000]  I'm going to tie all of this together,
[13:00.000 --> 13:03.000]  but here's the short clip of Tucker Carlson that's got the Canadian government
[13:03.000 --> 13:07.000]  having parliamentary meetings and parliamentary speeches
[13:07.000 --> 13:11.000]  and discussions about what to do of the looming threat.
[13:11.000 --> 13:14.000]  And obviously, Tucker Carlson is a super smart genius,
[13:14.000 --> 13:17.000]  and what he did is baited them,
[13:17.000 --> 13:20.000]  knowing that he would cause a bigger national debate about how
[13:20.000 --> 13:24.000]  there's a totalitarian regime when he got elected again
[13:24.000 --> 13:27.000]  as the leader of Canada a few months ago last year.
[13:27.000 --> 13:31.000]  Trudeau was at a 30% approval rating and got about 30% of the vote.
[13:31.000 --> 13:34.000]  Now he's down to about 18% national polls.
[13:34.000 --> 13:37.000]  Now you ask, how is he elected when they keep percent of the support?
[13:37.000 --> 13:39.000]  Or 30, because it's a parliament.
[13:39.000 --> 13:43.000]  They can get different facts as the parliament to just give him a majority,
[13:43.000 --> 13:46.000]  and still he wins, even though in the popular vote,
[13:46.000 --> 13:51.000]  he got right around 30% of the vote for his party.
[13:51.000 --> 13:55.000]  So all these people are disliked.
[13:55.000 --> 13:57.000]  They are reviled.
[13:57.000 --> 13:59.000]  They are hated by their populations,
[13:59.000 --> 14:03.000]  but for some reason we can't seem to get rid of them.
[14:03.000 --> 14:05.000]  Even if we get rid of them occasionally with a scandal,
[14:05.000 --> 14:09.000]  the permanent bureaucracy, the deep state, the permanent state,
[14:09.000 --> 14:11.000]  whatever you want to call it, that's what it is,
[14:11.000 --> 14:15.000]  is a bureaucracy celebrating that they can block what Trump wanted to do.
[14:15.000 --> 14:18.000]  They can block what Richard Nixon wanted to do.
[14:18.000 --> 14:23.000]  And they are at war with our rule of law and our country.
[14:23.000 --> 14:25.000]  So here's the short clip that's got everybody up in arms
[14:25.000 --> 14:27.000]  that I think really should spur a debate.
[14:27.000 --> 14:29.000]  Yes, we need to liberate our nations,
[14:29.000 --> 14:31.000]  but first you have to know who's in control of them,
[14:31.000 --> 14:34.000]  and you've got to figure out what you're going to replace it with,
[14:34.000 --> 14:37.000]  and you've got to figure out how to do it as peacefully as possible.
[14:37.000 --> 14:40.000]  But if we start winning peacefully, culturally,
[14:40.000 --> 14:42.000]  they're going to engage in election fraud.
[14:42.000 --> 14:44.000]  They're going to engage in censorship.
[14:44.000 --> 14:46.000]  They're going to engage in surveillance.
[14:46.000 --> 14:48.000]  They're going to engage in economic warfare.
[14:48.000 --> 14:51.000]  They're going to engage in intimidation, which they've done.
[14:51.000 --> 14:53.000]  And then try to stage violent events
[14:53.000 --> 14:55.000]  to make their opposition look violent.
[14:55.000 --> 14:58.000]  As Mahatma Gandhi said, there are multiple stages
[14:58.000 --> 15:01.000]  of taking your country back, of revolution.
[15:01.000 --> 15:04.000]  First, they ignore you.
[15:04.000 --> 15:06.000]  Then they laugh at you.
[15:06.000 --> 15:09.000]  Then they try to outlaw and attack you.
[15:09.000 --> 15:12.000]  Then you win, and we're into the outlaw attack mode,
[15:12.000 --> 15:14.000]  attack outlaw mode right now.
[15:14.000 --> 15:16.000]  So everybody getting freaked out and thinking,
[15:16.000 --> 15:18.000]  hey, we're in deep trouble. This is terrible.
[15:18.000 --> 15:20.000]  We've got total tyrants.
[15:20.000 --> 15:22.000]  The gloves are off. The mask is off.
[15:22.000 --> 15:24.000]  The gloves have been off for a long time.
[15:24.000 --> 15:26.000]  Now the mask is off, folks,
[15:26.000 --> 15:28.000]  and people can see that this is tyranny
[15:28.000 --> 15:30.000]  corporately run by the big Fortune 100
[15:30.000 --> 15:32.000]  that control the WEF and the UN
[15:32.000 --> 15:35.000]  that are bringing this tyranny to our shores.
[15:35.000 --> 15:38.000]  Here's a clip of Carlson going off to break.
[15:38.000 --> 15:41.000]  Why should we stand back and let our biggest trading partner,
[15:41.000 --> 15:43.000]  the country with which we share the longest border,
[15:43.000 --> 15:45.000]  and actually, I could just say a great country.
[15:45.000 --> 15:48.000]  I love Canada. I've always loved Canada because of the central beauty.
[15:48.000 --> 15:50.000]  Why should we let it become Cuba?
[15:50.000 --> 15:52.000]  Why don't we liberate it?
[15:52.000 --> 15:54.000]  We're spending all this money to liberate Ukraine from the Russians.
[15:54.000 --> 15:56.000]  Why are we not sending an armed force north
[15:56.000 --> 15:58.000]  to liberate Canada from Trudeau? And I mean it.
[16:01.000 --> 16:03.000]  I talk a lot about the great successes
[16:03.000 --> 16:05.000]  Info Wars has had.
[16:05.000 --> 16:07.000]  I don't think anybody can deny it.
[16:07.000 --> 16:10.000]  And it is because of Lister's viewers supporting us.
[16:10.000 --> 16:12.000]  When we talk about the crew at Info Wars,
[16:12.000 --> 16:15.000]  people behind the scenes, the researchers, the writers,
[16:15.000 --> 16:19.000]  they really have been the MVPs in this fight.
[16:19.000 --> 16:22.000]  And when we look at Harrison Smith and Owen Schreuer
[16:22.000 --> 16:24.000]  and the hard work they engage in every day,
[16:24.000 --> 16:26.000]  five, six, seven days a week,
[16:26.000 --> 16:28.000]  it's really just incredible.
[16:28.000 --> 16:30.000]  So for myself and the whole Info Wars crew,
[16:30.000 --> 16:32.000]  I thank you for your past support.
[16:32.000 --> 16:34.000]  I only encourage you now to realize that
[16:34.000 --> 16:37.000]  Info Wars cannot stay on air if you do not support us.
[16:37.000 --> 16:39.000]  I know you spread the word. I know you pray for us,
[16:39.000 --> 16:41.000]  and that's wonderful. Keep doing it.
[16:41.000 --> 16:43.000]  But most viewers and listeners,
[16:43.000 --> 16:45.000]  if you ever go to InfoWarsStore.com
[16:45.000 --> 16:48.000]  and you never buy great products that enrich and empower your life,
[16:48.000 --> 16:50.000]  all at the same time, keep us on air.
[16:50.000 --> 16:52.000]  I know that less than one percent of our listeners
[16:52.000 --> 16:54.000]  actually go buy products at InfoWarsStore.com.
[16:54.000 --> 16:56.000]  If just one percent more of you took action
[16:56.000 --> 16:58.000]  that went to InfoWarsStore.com,
[16:58.000 --> 17:14.000]  we'll be right back.
[17:29.000 --> 17:31.000]  Keep me on the front lines against the enemy
[17:31.000 --> 17:33.000]  while getting great products at the same time
[17:33.000 --> 17:35.000]  that will empower you and your family.

[17:44.000 --> 17:46.000]  not part of it going towards product cost.

[17:52.000 --> 17:54.000]  I thank you for your support. Now take action.
[17:54.000 --> 18:00.000]  The globalists are counting on you not taking action.
[18:00.000 --> 18:03.000]  In the year 2000, Alex Jones' film,
[18:03.000 --> 18:06.000]  Dark Secrets Inside Bohemian Grove,
[18:06.000 --> 18:09.000]  showed the world how our so-called elite leaders
[18:09.000 --> 18:15.000]  practice mock ritual sacrifices in private.
[18:15.000 --> 18:18.000]  In 2007, Alex Jones releases Endgame,
[18:18.000 --> 18:20.000]  exposing the world elite's plans
[18:20.000 --> 18:25.000]  for covertly using biological weapons against all of mankind.
[18:25.000 --> 18:28.000]  And by the time they launched their attack in 2020,
[18:28.000 --> 18:31.000]  Alex Jones' InfoWars and our audience
[18:31.000 --> 18:35.000]  were there to warn the people of the deadly vaccines
[18:35.000 --> 18:37.000]  that we knew were coming.
[18:37.000 --> 18:39.000]  This is why they attack us.
[18:39.000 --> 18:41.000]  This is why we need your support.
[18:41.000 --> 18:45.000]  Because we tell the truth, Alex Jones was right.
[18:45.000 --> 18:48.000]  Join the resistance. Buy products.
[18:48.000 --> 18:51.000]  Donate to the cause. Share the links.
[18:51.000 --> 18:54.000]  Join us in the fight for freedom
[18:54.000 --> 19:20.000]  and help us defeat the New World Order.
[19:25.000 --> 19:33.000]  On the horse was named Death.
[19:33.000 --> 19:34.000]  Now the translation is,
[19:34.000 --> 19:39.000]  I looked and behold a pale horse
[19:39.000 --> 19:41.000]  and his name that sat on him was Death
[19:41.000 --> 19:44.000]  and hell followed with him.
[19:44.000 --> 19:47.000]  The Book of Revelation.
[19:47.000 --> 19:49.000]  Very serious times to be alive, folks.
[19:49.000 --> 19:51.000]  They're not just doing this as a one-off.
[19:51.000 --> 19:53.000]  This is the beginning of the rest of our lives.
[19:53.000 --> 19:54.000]  And I'm proud of humanity.
[19:54.000 --> 19:56.000]  The globalists even admit it's leaked.
[19:56.000 --> 19:58.000]  They're very upset that they're losing
[19:58.000 --> 20:27.000]  and that this hasn't gone the way they thought it would.
[20:29.000 --> 20:34.000]  There's something cause I know what I'm saying
[20:34.000 --> 20:38.000]  I'm on my way, no, you're not gonna change my plan
[20:38.000 --> 20:42.000]  If you can break away and see what I say
[20:42.000 --> 20:46.000]  You'll understand what brings life to me
[20:46.000 --> 20:50.000]  I'm sick and tired of talking about new things
[20:50.000 --> 20:54.000]  I'm sick and tired of getting away from my way
[20:54.000 --> 20:56.000]  The American way
[20:56.000 --> 20:59.000]  The globalists think they're gonna win
[20:59.000 --> 21:01.000]  their revolution against humanity
[21:01.000 --> 21:05.000]  But I can tell you I have seen the future
[21:05.000 --> 21:12.000]  And it's they who'll be destroyed.
[21:12.000 --> 21:14.000]  Alright, ladies and gentlemen, let's get into it.
[21:14.000 --> 21:17.000]  So, there's a big debate going on in Canada
[21:17.000 --> 21:19.000]  Big debate going on here in the United States
[21:19.000 --> 21:21.000]  It's happening in Congress
[21:21.000 --> 21:23.000]  Where the Republicans are coming out
[21:23.000 --> 21:26.000]  The Patriot Caucus, the Liberty Caucus
[21:26.000 --> 21:28.000]  And the Freedom Caucus
[21:28.000 --> 21:31.000]  And they're saying, we want you to come out
[21:31.000 --> 21:33.000]  in resolutions against communism
[21:33.000 --> 21:36.000]  and totalitarianism and dictatorship
[21:36.000 --> 21:39.000]  And the Democratic Party is defending it
[21:39.000 --> 21:41.000]  And saying it will undermine their agenda
[21:41.000 --> 21:46.000]  To come out and say we're not gonna kill babies
[21:46.000 --> 21:48.000]  after they're born
[21:48.000 --> 21:51.000]  Two weeks ago they voted no against that resolution
[21:51.000 --> 21:54.000]  Now this week they're voting against a resolution
[21:54.000 --> 21:59.000]  against dictatorship in the world
[21:59.000 --> 22:04.000]  Remember, Nancy Pelosi four years ago said that
[22:04.000 --> 22:10.000]  MS-13, the per capita most violent gang in the world
[22:10.000 --> 22:13.000]  They killed many of their victims in satanic rituals
[22:13.000 --> 22:16.000]  They believe, give them demonic power
[22:16.000 --> 22:20.000]  And Nancy Pelosi said they are all God's children
[22:20.000 --> 22:22.000]  And the Tucker Carlson says that
[22:22.000 --> 22:24.000]  we're talking about regime change around the world
[22:24.000 --> 22:26.000]  We've got a big Cuba north of us
[22:26.000 --> 22:30.000]  that has a man setting up a dictatorship up there
[22:30.000 --> 22:32.000]  They have parliamentary hearings where they admit
[22:32.000 --> 22:36.000]  he's continuing the emergency manning free speech
[22:36.000 --> 22:39.000]  Shouldn't we talk about liberating Canada
[22:39.000 --> 22:42.000]  And that is meant to spur a discussion
[22:42.000 --> 22:45.000]  of how we are going into an authoritarian
[22:45.000 --> 22:49.000]  slash totalitarian system
[22:49.000 --> 22:54.000]  So here's a clip of Hakeem Jeffries
[22:54.000 --> 22:57.000]  opposing a resolution condemning brutal
[22:57.000 --> 23:00.000]  and corrupt socialist dictators
[23:00.000 --> 23:03.000]  They bring to the floor the House of Representatives today
[23:03.000 --> 23:07.000]  a resolution on socialism
[23:07.000 --> 23:13.000]  to condemn some dictators that we all condemn
[23:13.000 --> 23:17.000]  but understand the goal of this phony
[23:17.000 --> 23:20.000]  fake and fraudulent resolution
[23:20.000 --> 23:23.000]  is just to somehow provide cover
[23:23.000 --> 23:27.000]  for extreme maga republicans to try to undermine
[23:27.000 --> 23:30.000]  an agenda that is designed to lift up
[23:30.000 --> 23:33.000]  the health, safety and well-being of the American people
[23:33.000 --> 23:36.000]  Well, that's some good double-speak
[23:36.000 --> 23:40.000]  We're against dictators, but we're not going to condemn them
[23:40.000 --> 23:44.000]  Here's Representative Chip Roy discussing this abomination
[23:44.000 --> 23:48.000]  But we are here
[23:48.000 --> 23:49.000]  And I think this is important
[23:49.000 --> 23:51.000]  Again, this is going to be an amendment
[23:51.000 --> 23:52.000]  Maybe I have like one or two minutes of debate
[23:52.000 --> 23:54.000]  but now we're having a full-throated debate
[23:54.000 --> 23:57.000]  because just like yesterday in the Rules Committee
[23:57.000 --> 23:59.000]  of the House of Representatives
[23:59.000 --> 24:01.000]  when we offered a resolution saying that we stand
[24:01.000 --> 24:03.000]  to thwart socialism
[24:03.000 --> 24:05.000]  there was complete opposition by my colleagues
[24:05.000 --> 24:07.000]  on the other side of the aisle to standing
[24:07.000 --> 24:09.000]  to thwart socialism
[24:09.000 --> 24:11.000]  Literally, a full debate
[24:11.000 --> 24:14.000]  No, no, no, we cannot stand against socialism
[24:14.000 --> 24:16.000]  in the House Rules Committee
[24:16.000 --> 24:18.000]  by colleagues on the other side of the aisle
[24:18.000 --> 24:20.000]  So I just want the American people to understand
[24:20.000 --> 24:21.000]  in the House Judiciary Committee
[24:21.000 --> 24:23.000]  we have opposition to pledging allegiance
[24:23.000 --> 24:25.000]  to the flag of the United States
[24:25.000 --> 24:27.000]  We have questions being raised about whether we should pledge allegiance
[24:27.000 --> 24:28.000]  to the flag of the United States
[24:28.000 --> 24:31.000]  and representing that it is one nation under God
[24:31.000 --> 24:35.000]  We have a Democratic Party that refuses
[24:35.000 --> 24:38.000]  to stand up and say that they oppose socialism
[24:38.000 --> 24:40.000]  and fought it in the House Rules Committee
[24:40.000 --> 24:42.000]  Presumably, we'll fight it on the House floor
[24:42.000 --> 24:44.000]  We'll see how the vote plays out
[24:44.000 --> 24:48.000]  and that is the state of your Democratic Party today
[24:48.000 --> 24:50.000]  That is the state of your Democratic Party today
[24:50.000 --> 24:53.000]  The full breakdown and a bunch of the clips
[24:53.000 --> 24:55.000]  are on infowars.com and an article
[24:55.000 --> 24:57.000]  GOP Rep Chip Roy Exposes Dems
[24:57.000 --> 24:59.000]  for Refusing to Condemn Socialism
[24:59.000 --> 25:01.000]  and Opposing Pledge of Allegiance
[25:01.000 --> 25:03.000]  And folks, this is the debate we need to be having
[25:03.000 --> 25:05.000]  We need to force this out in the open
[25:05.000 --> 25:08.000]  that multinational companies are promoting
[25:08.000 --> 25:11.000]  Classical Dictatorship and Centralized
[25:11.000 --> 25:13.000]  Authoritarian to Toletarian Control
[25:13.000 --> 25:16.000]  We're trying to surveil us, ban our speech
[25:16.000 --> 25:19.000]  Cut off the money supply of people
[25:19.000 --> 25:21.000]  that don't go along with the system
[25:21.000 --> 25:25.000]  A group of Catholic school, high school students
[25:25.000 --> 25:28.000]  wasn't just attacked outside a DC building
[25:28.000 --> 25:30.000]  a few years ago famously and the media claimed
[25:30.000 --> 25:31.000]  they attacked people
[25:31.000 --> 25:34.000]  But now there's new video and new articles
[25:34.000 --> 25:37.000]  where a bunch of Catholic school kids
[25:37.000 --> 25:43.000]  young people go at the Smithsonian Museum
[25:43.000 --> 25:45.000]  in DC and were thrown out
[25:45.000 --> 25:48.000]  because they were wearing pro-life hats
[25:48.000 --> 25:50.000]  that said I'm pro-life on it
[25:50.000 --> 25:55.000]  and the DC police are defending that
[25:55.000 --> 25:58.000]  saying you're not allowed to have a political message in here
[25:58.000 --> 26:00.000]  What the hell does that mean?
[26:00.000 --> 26:02.000]  What do you think gay pride is?
[26:02.000 --> 26:05.000]  I don't care if you're gay or straight or what you are
[26:05.000 --> 26:07.000]  I've never attacked anybody for that
[26:07.000 --> 26:08.000]  as long as they're an adult
[26:08.000 --> 26:11.000]  But you don't target our children with heterosexual, homosexual
[26:11.000 --> 26:12.000]  or anything else
[26:12.000 --> 26:15.000]  and you certainly don't have the gay pride movement worldwide
[26:15.000 --> 26:19.000]  being a transhumanist, globalist, new world order thing
[26:19.000 --> 26:23.000]  that the big corporations that own slave factories in China
[26:23.000 --> 26:24.000]  wrap themselves in
[26:24.000 --> 26:27.000]  Oh, it's okay we got slaves, labor in China
[26:27.000 --> 26:30.000]  and Tim Cook has the worst factories that he contracts with
[26:30.000 --> 26:32.000]  at Foxconn with 18 hour work days
[26:32.000 --> 26:34.000]  and forced abortions and suicide nets
[26:34.000 --> 26:36.000]  because he's gay
[26:36.000 --> 26:38.000]  and he gives money to Black Lives Matter
[26:38.000 --> 26:40.000]  They wrap themselves in Black Lives Matter
[26:40.000 --> 26:44.000]  and LGBTQ, XYZ, crap
[26:44.000 --> 26:47.000]  when nobody's opposing their life or what they're doing
[26:47.000 --> 26:48.000]  they've got freedom, they're here
[26:48.000 --> 26:50.000]  and then they want access to our children
[26:50.000 --> 26:52.000]  to tell them about sex
[26:52.000 --> 26:54.000]  and then to attach it to everything else
[26:54.000 --> 26:56.000]  and then have them parade them out
[26:56.000 --> 26:57.000]  Right here I live in Austin
[26:57.000 --> 26:59.000]  at elementary and middle schools
[26:59.000 --> 27:01.000]  little kids told put these flags on
[27:01.000 --> 27:02.000]  put these messages on
[27:02.000 --> 27:03.000]  and then march around on the streets
[27:03.000 --> 27:06.000]  without even telling their parents
[27:06.000 --> 27:09.000]  if you were going to have my kids in a public school
[27:09.000 --> 27:12.000]  or a private school march for the Democratic Party
[27:12.000 --> 27:13.000]  or the Republican Party
[27:13.000 --> 27:14.000]  or for the environmentalism
[27:14.000 --> 27:15.000]  or for anything
[27:15.000 --> 27:18.000]  you better tell me so I can keep them home
[27:18.000 --> 27:19.000]  if I don't agree with that
[27:19.000 --> 27:23.000]  plus a school shouldn't be politicizing things
[27:23.000 --> 27:26.000]  much less attaching it to sex
[27:26.000 --> 27:27.000]  ladies and gentlemen
[27:27.000 --> 27:28.000]  and their sexual future
[27:28.000 --> 27:29.000]  and transgenderism
[27:29.000 --> 27:31.000]  and confusing children about who they are
[27:31.000 --> 27:34.000]  when they're young and very impressionable
[27:34.000 --> 27:36.000]  it's a big debate between parents
[27:36.000 --> 27:39.000]  when to teach their children about sex education
[27:39.000 --> 27:41.000]  and the birds and the bees
[27:41.000 --> 27:43.000]  you certainly don't want strangers
[27:43.000 --> 27:45.000]  when they're five, six, seven years old
[27:45.000 --> 27:47.000]  with a globalist agenda teaching them
[27:47.000 --> 27:48.000]  and we all know that
[27:48.000 --> 27:50.000]  and it's creepy as hell
[27:50.000 --> 27:53.000]  in fact it made me so disturbed last week
[27:53.000 --> 27:56.000]  like last Monday I never aired it
[27:56.000 --> 27:57.000]  and I sent it to Owen on Friday
[27:57.000 --> 28:00.000]  and said please air it but I didn't watch the show
[28:00.000 --> 28:02.000]  you guys pull up that video
[28:02.000 --> 28:05.000]  of the academics with the black doll
[28:05.000 --> 28:06.000]  the little kids saying
[28:06.000 --> 28:08.000]  is it a boy, is it a girl trying to confuse them
[28:08.000 --> 28:09.000]  and the kid goes it's non-binary
[28:09.000 --> 28:10.000]  and they go good
[28:10.000 --> 28:11.000]  then the teachers brag
[28:11.000 --> 28:13.000]  look how we're taking over their minds
[28:13.000 --> 28:15.000]  look how he said in a non-binary
[28:15.000 --> 28:16.000]  it's working so well
[28:16.000 --> 28:18.000]  and I can show you the videos where they say
[28:18.000 --> 28:19.000]  we're gonna recruit your children
[28:19.000 --> 28:21.000]  we're gonna get your children
[28:21.000 --> 28:23.000]  again, if a man walked up to your eight year old daughter
[28:23.000 --> 28:24.000]  in a park
[28:24.000 --> 28:26.000]  while you're sitting there playing volleyball
[28:26.000 --> 28:28.000]  and she's over there
[28:28.000 --> 28:30.000]  eating potato chips
[28:30.000 --> 28:31.000]  or playing with her toys
[28:31.000 --> 28:33.000]  and a man comes up and says
[28:33.000 --> 28:35.000]  I wanna talk to you little boy, little girl
[28:35.000 --> 28:37.000]  about your sexual preference
[28:37.000 --> 28:39.000]  and what you're gonna be when you grow up
[28:39.000 --> 28:42.000]  that person would be lucky to not go to the hospital
[28:42.000 --> 28:44.000]  and they'd probably get arrested
[28:44.000 --> 28:46.000]  but if it's done academically
[28:46.000 --> 28:47.000]  it's all cute and funny
[28:47.000 --> 28:49.000]  they want control of your
[28:49.000 --> 28:52.000]  they wanna form a sexual relationship with them
[28:52.000 --> 28:54.000]  to control them in the future
[28:54.000 --> 28:55.000]  they wanna destroy their innocence
[28:55.000 --> 28:58.000]  it's a cult of mind-controlling pedophiles
[29:08.000 --> 29:10.000]  Hey, what's up, Bone?
[29:10.000 --> 29:12.000]  Hey, McBreen, what's going on, man?
[29:12.000 --> 29:14.000]  Hey, really like that work you did
[29:14.000 --> 29:16.000]  on the AI piece?
[29:16.000 --> 29:18.000]  I'm gonna use that on the show today
[29:18.000 --> 29:19.000]  I worked hard on that
[29:19.000 --> 29:20.000]  I'm working on another project
[29:20.000 --> 29:22.000]  so I'm gonna be up late again tonight
[29:22.000 --> 29:24.000]  and I was hoping you had some brain force plus
[29:24.000 --> 29:26.000]  Oh, um...
[29:26.000 --> 29:28.000]  No
[29:28.000 --> 29:29.000]  No, nothing
[29:29.000 --> 29:30.000]  Nothing
[29:30.000 --> 29:32.000]  What about Brain Force Ultra?
[29:32.000 --> 29:34.000]  Um...
[29:37.000 --> 29:38.000]  No
[29:38.000 --> 29:40.000]  Hmm, okay
[29:40.000 --> 29:41.000]  Yeah
[29:41.000 --> 29:42.000]  Thanks anyway
[29:42.000 --> 29:43.000]  Yeah

[31:02.000 --> 31:04.000]  Your mind is a battlefield
[31:04.000 --> 31:06.000]  This is an information war
[31:06.000 --> 31:08.000]  Infowars popularized those terms
[31:08.000 --> 31:10.000]  more than two decades ago
[31:10.000 --> 31:12.000]  and today whether it's Donald Trump
[31:12.000 --> 31:14.000]  or Governor DeSantis
[31:14.000 --> 31:16.000]  or Dr. Robert Malone
[31:16.000 --> 31:18.000]  they're all using the terms
[31:18.000 --> 31:20.000]  Infowars has popularized
[31:20.000 --> 31:22.000]  because we understand the enemy's operations
[31:22.000 --> 31:24.000]  and we know how to beat them

[31:46.000 --> 31:48.000]  in the nose
[31:48.000 --> 31:50.000]  punching their lies in the nose
[31:50.000 --> 31:52.000]  we are going to defeat the new world order

[32:14.000 --> 32:16.000]  there's nothing you can do

[32:18.000 --> 32:20.000]  in the fight for liberty
[32:20.000 --> 32:22.000]  I don't think anybody denies that fact

[33:26.000 --> 33:28.000]  so we are in a culture war
[33:28.000 --> 33:30.000]  funded and controlled
[33:30.000 --> 33:32.000]  and designed by the biggest
[33:32.000 --> 33:34.000]  most powerful companies and institutions in the world
[33:34.000 --> 33:36.000]  everything the left pushes
[33:36.000 --> 33:38.000]  is the establishment narrative
[33:38.000 --> 33:40.000]  it is the power structure
[33:40.000 --> 33:42.000]  it is the man
[33:42.000 --> 33:44.000]  they are not anti-establishment
[33:44.000 --> 33:46.000]  they are pro-transhumanist
[33:46.000 --> 33:48.000]  corporate world government
[33:48.000 --> 33:50.000]  destruction of the family
[33:50.000 --> 33:52.000]  cutting off your interdiction
[33:52.000 --> 33:54.000]  they are pro-transhumanist
[33:54.000 --> 33:56.000]  destruction of the family
[33:56.000 --> 33:58.000]  cutting off your energy
[33:58.000 --> 34:00.000]  atomizing individuals where we can all
[34:00.000 --> 34:02.000]  be cut off and controlled
[34:02.000 --> 34:04.000]  it is a predatory system
[34:04.000 --> 34:08.000]  mass.com syndrome strikes
[34:08.000 --> 34:10.000]  as the masses continue
[34:10.000 --> 34:12.000]  as the masses continue
[34:12.000 --> 34:14.000]  bowing to the COVID cult
[34:14.000 --> 34:16.000]  and beyond
[34:16.000 --> 34:18.000]  and I have a bunch of examples
[34:18.000 --> 34:20.000]  that I am going to get to that I am going to give a number out and take your calls
[34:20.000 --> 34:22.000]  but it all ties together
[34:22.000 --> 34:24.100]  it's domestication, it's isolation,
[34:24.100 --> 34:25.960]  it's that you're non-essential.
[34:25.960 --> 34:28.440]  It is such a horrible nightmare system
[34:28.440 --> 34:31.160]  that they're bringing into play right now.
[34:31.160 --> 34:33.320]  So let's go ahead and start running through it.
[34:33.320 --> 34:35.400]  Since I mentioned this,
[34:35.400 --> 34:37.040]  M4's wrote about this last Monday,
[34:37.040 --> 34:39.160]  I mentioned it, but never got to it.
[34:39.160 --> 34:42.080]  This is North Carolina Education Association.
[34:42.080 --> 34:44.120]  This is what's taught to academics in public
[34:44.120 --> 34:47.920]  and private schools across North Carolina.
[34:47.920 --> 34:51.480]  This is Maddie Piper, and excuse me, I made a mistake.
[34:51.480 --> 34:54.120]  I said they're doing this to first graders
[34:54.120 --> 34:56.240]  and kindergartners, no, I'm sorry.
[34:56.240 --> 34:57.760]  This is in preschool.
[34:58.680 --> 35:01.080]  These children are three to five.
[35:02.080 --> 35:05.680]  And the doll is non-binary, it's not a boy or girl,
[35:05.680 --> 35:08.120]  so they learn that term and start thinking,
[35:08.120 --> 35:09.760]  maybe I'm not a boy or a girl,
[35:09.760 --> 35:11.680]  so they're slotted into the system
[35:11.680 --> 35:13.840]  to then be counseled and given sterilants
[35:13.840 --> 35:15.200]  and taken away from their parents,
[35:15.200 --> 35:17.200]  and then finally have their breast and penises
[35:17.200 --> 35:18.440]  and testicles cut off.
[35:19.720 --> 35:21.160]  And the new comic book characters
[35:21.160 --> 35:23.080]  and the cartoon characters are all there,
[35:23.080 --> 35:26.240]  making it fashionable to have your reproductive system
[35:26.240 --> 35:28.280]  destroyed and your biological system
[35:28.280 --> 35:31.200]  of X and Y chromosomes annihilated.
[35:31.200 --> 35:32.800]  So we're gonna play this clip,
[35:32.800 --> 35:35.320]  then I'm gonna play a Mr. Rogers clip
[35:35.320 --> 35:36.800]  that's got the left up in arms,
[35:36.800 --> 35:39.920]  they're demanding the articles on infowars.com,
[35:39.920 --> 35:42.640]  let this coalition's that Mr. Rogers shows
[35:42.640 --> 35:45.760]  be reviewed and that not be allowed to air
[35:45.760 --> 35:47.920]  if he calls people, boys, and girls.
[35:47.920 --> 35:49.440]  Just like Bill Guy of the Science Club,
[35:49.440 --> 35:51.000]  we played the clip a few years ago,
[35:51.000 --> 35:52.760]  of him in the 90's saying, you are X,
[35:52.760 --> 35:54.880]  you are Y, you are boy, you are girl.
[35:54.880 --> 35:56.680]  Those have been removed,
[35:58.040 --> 36:01.440]  and he supports those episodes never airing again.
[36:01.440 --> 36:06.280]  I mean, what a cult of controller.
[36:07.560 --> 36:09.360]  What a cult of control.
[36:10.800 --> 36:13.400]  Absolutely stunning, here's the clip.
[36:13.400 --> 36:18.200]  Oh, Huckleberries, today I wanted to introduce you
[36:18.200 --> 36:21.040]  to a new friend in our class.
[36:22.480 --> 36:26.480]  This Huckleberries is my friend, Nash.
[36:26.480 --> 36:28.800]  It's their first day in our class.
[36:28.800 --> 36:31.520]  They're just looking around at all of you,
[36:31.520 --> 36:34.840]  and they're so curious to know who you all are.
[36:34.840 --> 36:38.360]  Today was fun.
[36:38.360 --> 36:40.240]  It was really interesting though,
[36:40.240 --> 36:41.880]  knowing going in, being like,
[36:42.800 --> 36:44.960]  I don't know what questions kiddos are gonna have
[36:44.960 --> 36:47.240]  or what they're gonna say,
[36:47.240 --> 36:50.000]  which is both like, nervous, racking,
[36:50.000 --> 36:51.120]  but also kind of exciting.
[36:51.120 --> 36:55.440]  It's that place of not knowing as a teacher
[36:55.440 --> 36:57.880]  and just being okay with that.
[36:57.880 --> 36:59.960]  And the friend likes to ask the question,
[36:59.960 --> 37:02.520]  are you a boy or a girl?
[37:02.520 --> 37:05.800]  Hit pause, back up the clip 10 seconds.
[37:05.800 --> 37:09.720]  Listen how creepy and snake like this woman's voice is,
[37:09.720 --> 37:12.400]  so she can confuse children, put this in their minds,
[37:12.400 --> 37:14.840]  and then claim the children spontaneously believe it.
[37:14.840 --> 37:18.640]  They've had major academics and a Biden cabinet officials
[37:18.640 --> 37:19.920]  come out and say,
[37:21.200 --> 37:26.200]  babies know they're non-binary or gay or straight at birth.
[37:26.200 --> 37:27.040]  They don't want children to have
[37:27.040 --> 37:28.840]  any chance to lead their own lives.
[37:28.840 --> 37:33.720]  It's a cult to destroy the individual free will.
[37:33.720 --> 37:35.160]  Continue.
[37:35.160 --> 37:38.000]  There's, I'm just a kid.
[37:38.000 --> 37:41.480]  But a kid, but kids can be boys or girls.
[37:41.480 --> 37:43.520]  They can be boys or girls.
[37:43.520 --> 37:46.480]  Hey, maybe non-binary.
[37:46.480 --> 37:47.960]  Yeah.
[37:47.960 --> 37:51.560]  It was just like, non-binary, yeah.
[37:51.560 --> 37:53.200]  That's just something that we know.
[37:53.200 --> 37:55.960]  And this is something, I mean, it's like,
[37:57.000 --> 37:58.320]  they're four and five years old
[37:58.320 --> 37:59.840]  and they just didn't make a big deal
[37:59.840 --> 38:02.000]  out of being a boy or a girl.
[38:02.000 --> 38:04.400]  And I think it was a huge testament
[38:04.400 --> 38:07.040]  to how much we've been talking about it in the classroom,
[38:07.040 --> 38:09.760]  that you never mentioned the term non-binary.
[38:09.760 --> 38:12.880]  It was a child who brought that up
[38:12.880 --> 38:16.080]  because it's constantly in conversation.
[38:16.080 --> 38:17.280]  Yeah, just like me.
[38:17.280 --> 38:22.000]  So Nash, just like me, is non-binary.
[38:22.000 --> 38:27.000]  So they aren't sure if they're a boy or a girl.
[38:27.000 --> 38:29.560]  So when people ask them, are you a boy or a girl?
[38:29.560 --> 38:33.680]  Right now they just feel like saying, I'm a kid.
[38:33.680 --> 38:35.120]  They're figuring it out.
[38:36.120 --> 38:39.800]  Why does he like, does he like stars?
[38:39.800 --> 38:42.840]  They like stars.
[38:42.840 --> 38:44.760]  They like stars.
[38:44.760 --> 38:46.000]  Yeah.
[38:46.000 --> 38:47.840]  And they are really.
[38:47.840 --> 38:49.680]  They want to wear a star shirt.
[38:49.680 --> 38:50.800]  They wore their star shirt
[38:50.800 --> 38:52.560]  because it's their favorite shirt.
[38:52.560 --> 38:54.280]  And because they were nervous today,
[38:54.280 --> 38:55.480]  they thought they would wear something
[38:55.480 --> 38:57.120]  that makes them feel special.
[38:58.080 --> 38:59.920]  So the government corporate funded
[38:59.920 --> 39:01.680]  North Carolina educational group
[39:01.680 --> 39:06.920]  comes in to the public preschool
[39:06.920 --> 39:09.080]  and she commends the teachers
[39:09.080 --> 39:11.840]  that we say it so much in the class
[39:11.840 --> 39:13.640]  to the three, four and five year olds
[39:14.920 --> 39:16.440]  that they're saying it on their own.
[39:16.440 --> 39:19.600]  Yay, we're effectively brainwashing little children.
[39:19.600 --> 39:22.120]  Little girls like, does the little person,
[39:22.120 --> 39:24.920]  the little it that has no identity
[39:24.920 --> 39:27.200]  that's not projected by the state and corporations,
[39:27.200 --> 39:29.520]  does it like stars?
[39:29.520 --> 39:31.040]  Oh, they like stars.
[39:31.040 --> 39:32.360]  Not he or she.
[39:33.760 --> 39:38.760]  Diabolical, creepy, evil, dangerous to the max.
[39:38.760 --> 39:42.680]  Now, here is the clip that they're wanting removed
[39:42.680 --> 39:46.320]  of Mr. Rogers, committing a thought crime.
[39:47.320 --> 39:51.080]  Boys are boys from the beginning.
[39:51.080 --> 39:53.920]  If you were born a boy, you stay a boy.
[39:53.920 --> 39:57.720]  Girls are girls right from the start.
[39:57.720 --> 40:01.080]  If you were born a girl, you stay a girl
[40:01.080 --> 40:02.960]  and grow up to be a lady.
[40:02.960 --> 40:05.760]  Only girls can be the mummies.
[40:05.760 --> 40:08.760]  Only boys can be the daddies.
[40:10.760 --> 40:13.560]  All right, and the word is that's being removed
[40:13.560 --> 40:16.960]  off the internet for being a thought crime.
[40:16.960 --> 40:20.520]  Folks, we're already way down the rat hole with these people.
[40:20.520 --> 40:23.360]  Now, I've got a bunch of other examples of Stockholm syndrome
[40:23.360 --> 40:25.560]  with the poison shot we come back
[40:25.560 --> 40:26.960]  and then I'm gonna go to your phone calls.
[40:26.960 --> 40:30.720]  I'm gonna give the number out right now on mind control,
[40:30.720 --> 40:34.160]  on the war, on them cutting off the real world.
[40:34.160 --> 40:36.480]  On them cutting off the resources.
[40:36.480 --> 40:39.520]  On this anti-human attack.
[40:39.520 --> 40:40.720]  We can't just sit there and like,
[40:40.720 --> 40:41.760]  well, I'll be politically correct.
[40:41.760 --> 40:43.080]  I'll leave it alone.
[40:43.080 --> 40:43.920]  I'll comply.
[40:43.920 --> 40:45.480]  I'll have a good social credit score.
[40:45.480 --> 40:47.360]  There's always gonna be more and more and more and more
[40:47.360 --> 40:48.680]  they add and maybe you don't care
[40:48.680 --> 40:51.240]  what they do to kids, some of you, new listeners.
[40:51.240 --> 40:53.120]  But do you care about losing your car,
[40:53.120 --> 40:55.960]  losing your autonomy over your own body
[40:55.960 --> 40:57.160]  with these poison shots?
[40:57.160 --> 41:00.440]  Do you care about losing your stove or your fireplace?
[41:00.440 --> 41:02.080]  Cause I've got all the articles around the world
[41:02.080 --> 41:03.080]  where that's being banned.
[41:03.080 --> 41:04.520]  Where is this coming from?
[41:04.520 --> 41:06.400]  The big mega corporations.
[41:06.400 --> 41:07.400]  It's unified.
[41:07.400 --> 41:08.680]  It's the establishment.
[41:08.680 --> 41:09.840]  It's powerful.
[41:10.760 --> 41:12.960]  But we the people are eight billion.
[41:12.960 --> 41:15.360]  And when we do little things together, it moves mountains.
[41:15.360 --> 41:17.200]  So if the listeners, the millions tuned in
[41:17.200 --> 41:19.280]  will just tell their friends, families, strangers,
[41:19.280 --> 41:21.880]  neighbors about infowars.com forward slash show
[41:21.880 --> 41:23.840]  and man dot video and tell them to tell folks,
[41:23.840 --> 41:25.960]  tell them to tell folks, it changed the world.
[41:25.960 --> 41:28.600]  And if you'll just go to infowarscore.com,
[41:28.600 --> 41:31.520]  you'll get amazing products that keep this broadcast
[41:31.520 --> 41:33.640]  on the air that will enrich your life.
[41:33.640 --> 41:34.720]  That's called a win-win.
[41:34.720 --> 41:37.000]  Only way you don't win is not taking action.
[41:37.000 --> 41:38.240]  So take the action.
[41:38.240 --> 41:40.880]  Be part of the revolution against the establishment
[41:40.880 --> 41:44.400]  and their evil neo-futilistic transhumanism.
[41:44.400 --> 41:45.960]  Now this sale has to end on Monday.
[41:45.960 --> 41:47.320]  It'll be over Tuesday.
[41:47.320 --> 41:48.760]  It's the biggest sale we ever do.
[41:48.760 --> 41:50.640]  It's as big as our Christmas sale.
[41:50.640 --> 41:53.440]  And it is the Allo Shows us right emergency sale.
[41:53.440 --> 41:56.040]  I had an hour long marketing meetings this morning
[41:56.040 --> 41:58.640]  on what we got left and what we can sell, what we can do.
[41:58.640 --> 42:00.920]  So all this stuff's gonna go back to regular price.
[42:00.920 --> 42:03.800]  Even it's not already sold out on Tuesday.

[42:54.600 --> 42:59.600]  Now take action and fund the tip of the spear.
[43:01.360 --> 43:03.480]  I talk a lot about the great successes
[43:03.480 --> 43:04.840]  info wars has had.
[43:04.840 --> 43:06.760]  I don't think anybody can deny it.
[43:06.760 --> 43:10.800]  And it is because of listeners and viewers supporting us.
[43:10.800 --> 43:12.480]  When we talk about the crew at info wars,
[43:12.480 --> 43:15.120]  people behind the scenes, the researchers, the writers,
[43:16.120 --> 43:19.640]  they really have been the MVPs in this fight.
[43:19.640 --> 43:21.760]  And we look at Harrison Smith and Owen Schroyer
[43:21.760 --> 43:24.200]  and the hard work they engage in every day.
[43:24.200 --> 43:26.520]  Five, six, seven days a week.
[43:26.520 --> 43:28.440]  It's really just incredible.
[43:28.440 --> 43:30.120]  So for myself, the whole info wars crew,
[43:30.120 --> 43:32.080]  I thank you for your past support.
[43:32.080 --> 43:33.760]  I only encourage you now to realize
[43:33.760 --> 43:37.880]  that info wars cannot stay on air if you do not support us.
[43:37.880 --> 43:39.760]  I know you spread the word, I know you pray for us,
[43:39.760 --> 43:40.920]  and that's wonderful, keep doing it.
[43:40.920 --> 43:45.080]  But most viewers and listeners never go to infowarstore.com
[43:45.080 --> 43:46.400]  and you never buy great products
[43:46.400 --> 43:48.000]  that enrich and empower your life.
[43:48.000 --> 43:49.840]  All at the same time, keep us on air.
[43:49.840 --> 43:51.720]  I know that less than 1% of our listeners
[43:51.720 --> 43:54.120]  actually go buy products at infowarstore.com.
[43:54.120 --> 43:57.680]  If just 1% more of you took action and went to infowarstore.com,
[43:57.680 --> 43:59.080]  our funding problems will be over.
[43:59.080 --> 44:00.200]  Please take action now.
[44:00.200 --> 44:03.200]  Mark Twain, one of America's greatest writers
[44:03.200 --> 44:06.040]  and satirist in Mines,
[44:06.040 --> 44:09.360]  famously said more than 150 years ago,
[44:09.360 --> 44:13.000]  rumors of his demise had been greatly exaggerated.
[44:13.000 --> 44:15.000]  Cause the newspapers kept saying he died
[44:15.000 --> 44:16.920]  decades before he did die.
[44:16.920 --> 44:19.160]  And it's the same PSYOP today.
[44:19.160 --> 44:22.360]  Info wars is more influential and more powerful than ever
[44:22.360 --> 44:23.600]  because of your support.
[44:23.600 --> 44:26.760]  Because of the facts of what we've covered is coming true.
[44:26.760 --> 44:29.040]  But if they can convince you we've been shut down,
[44:29.040 --> 44:31.760]  if they can convince you that we're going away,
[44:31.760 --> 44:34.280]  and you stop supporting, you stop spreading the word,
[44:34.280 --> 44:35.600]  then they do win.
[44:35.600 --> 44:38.600]  Ladies and gentlemen, there's only one group of people
[44:38.600 --> 44:39.840]  that can shut down info wars,
[44:39.840 --> 44:41.720]  and that's you, the viewers and listeners.

[46:04.840 --> 46:06.960]  Now in 60 seconds, it's hard to tell you
[46:06.960 --> 46:08.720]  how incredible these products are,
[46:08.720 --> 46:11.960]  but all of these products are already sold
[46:11.960 --> 46:14.480]  on store shelves under other brand names
[46:14.480 --> 46:17.280]  for up to twice the cost we're selling it to you.
[46:17.280 --> 46:19.880]  These are high end, these are the very best.
[46:19.880 --> 46:22.360]  You know our body's ultimate tumor formula is amazing?
[46:22.360 --> 46:23.200]  Well guess what?
[46:23.200 --> 46:25.440]  We now have turmeric 95 that's basically
[46:25.440 --> 46:28.520]  the same formula for a lower price.
[46:28.520 --> 46:31.200]  CBD oil of the highest quality,
[46:31.200 --> 46:34.560]  up to 50% less than major competitors
[46:34.560 --> 46:38.120]  selling the exact high quality full spectrum CBD.
[46:38.120 --> 46:41.800]  And it goes on for all the new Info Wars MD products
[46:41.800 --> 46:43.280]  at infowarstore.com.
[46:43.280 --> 46:46.480]  The highest quality, directly from the manufacturer
[46:46.480 --> 46:50.600]  to your door at prices up to 50% in some cases
[46:50.600 --> 46:53.360]  100% lower than what they're sold for in stores.
[46:53.360 --> 46:55.680]  Info Wars MD at infowarstore.com.
[47:01.480 --> 47:04.280]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies
[47:04.280 --> 47:07.880]  of the new world order, it's Alex Jones.
[47:07.880 --> 47:11.880]  I remember when, I remember, I remember when I lost my mind.
[47:12.880 --> 47:16.360]  There was something so pleasant about that place.
[47:16.360 --> 47:20.880]  Even your emotions haven't let go in so much space.
[47:20.880 --> 47:23.880]  So it's critical to beat this mind control,
[47:24.880 --> 47:27.880]  to understand that 99% of people that go along
[47:27.880 --> 47:30.280]  with the power structure are followers
[47:30.280 --> 47:31.880]  and are under control.
[47:31.880 --> 47:34.880]  So it's critical to beat this mind control,
[47:34.880 --> 47:37.680]  to understand that 99% of people
[47:37.680 --> 47:41.360]  are under Mass.com syndrome and learned helplessness
[47:41.360 --> 47:43.800]  and have been positioned to not be able to understand
[47:43.800 --> 47:46.040]  they're being abused and can't ever admit
[47:46.040 --> 47:48.120]  that they're being abused.
[47:48.120 --> 47:50.000]  There's countless examples of this.
[47:50.000 --> 47:51.360]  The clips you see everywhere, people saying,
[47:51.360 --> 47:55.560]  well, I took the first shot and my face and arms
[47:55.560 --> 47:57.720]  were paralyzed for two weeks.
[47:57.720 --> 47:59.600]  And now I have red bloody spots all over me,
[47:59.600 --> 48:01.040]  but I'm taking the second one.
[48:01.040 --> 48:02.960]  I'm gonna be safe, I'm gonna do it.
[48:03.880 --> 48:05.440]  And you see those videos, you think,
[48:05.440 --> 48:08.760]  this has gotta be fake and then it turns out they're real.
[48:08.760 --> 48:10.720]  So it's easy to laugh at these people,
[48:10.720 --> 48:14.080]  but it's not funny because they're dangerous
[48:14.080 --> 48:16.000]  and they're gonna try to go along with forcing us
[48:16.000 --> 48:17.720]  to live in their hell with them because they're told,
[48:17.720 --> 48:20.280]  oh, utopia is always right over the hill,
[48:20.280 --> 48:22.360]  right around the next corner.
[48:22.360 --> 48:25.920]  We just can't get these bad people to listen to us
[48:25.920 --> 48:28.440]  and believe us if we could just have World War III.
[48:28.440 --> 48:30.920]  I mean, Sean Penn said, hey, nuclear war is not that bad.
[48:30.920 --> 48:34.320]  Really, we can do it, can't be off the table.
[48:34.320 --> 48:35.840]  Come on, nuclear war, folks.
[48:35.840 --> 48:37.880]  Hey, forced injections and experimental shots.
[48:37.880 --> 48:40.760]  Come on, convicted pedophiles having access to your kids.
[48:40.760 --> 48:43.920]  Open borders, fentanyl, devaluing the currency.
[48:45.160 --> 48:47.440]  Cutting off our energy, but not cutting off China's
[48:47.440 --> 48:49.160]  and others where the globalists invest.
[48:49.160 --> 48:51.120]  No, no, no, it's all for your own good.
[48:51.120 --> 48:52.720]  Show how moral you are.
[48:52.720 --> 48:56.680]  We'll patch you on the head and reward you psychologically
[48:56.680 --> 49:00.000]  and maybe give you some free tickets to a baseball game.
[49:00.000 --> 49:01.880]  If you take the injections, maybe a hamburger,
[49:01.880 --> 49:05.120]  maybe some french fries, you mean you get delicious fries
[49:05.120 --> 49:07.320]  with your delicious burger?
[49:07.320 --> 49:11.080]  So here he is, fully vaccinated, MSNBC host,
[49:11.080 --> 49:15.840]  Yasmin Vazagayan develops pancreatitis
[49:15.840 --> 49:18.480]  and then myocarditis, then blames the condition
[49:18.480 --> 49:20.200]  on the common cold.
[49:20.200 --> 49:22.040]  Or, you know, it's stroke season two now.
[49:22.040 --> 49:23.440]  Here she is.
[49:23.440 --> 49:27.600]  Oh, was pretty certain not to believe the reflux.
[49:27.600 --> 49:29.880]  The next day on December 30th, I woke up
[49:29.880 --> 49:31.520]  with severe pains both in my chest
[49:31.520 --> 49:33.400]  and in my left shoulder.
[49:33.400 --> 49:35.720]  And it was like a tightening in my chest
[49:35.720 --> 49:36.920]  when I took deep breaths.
[49:36.920 --> 49:39.600]  That got worse when I was laying flat.
[49:39.600 --> 49:41.240]  I knew enough at that moment to understand
[49:41.240 --> 49:43.840]  that it could mean, could, is the key word here,
[49:43.840 --> 49:45.440]  that I was having a heart attack, especially
[49:45.440 --> 49:48.200]  because it was happening in the left part of my shoulder.
[49:48.200 --> 49:50.080]  I wanna remind you, I run seven miles
[49:50.080 --> 49:53.000]  three to four times a week, or I did.
[49:53.000 --> 49:55.920]  I do yoga, I don't eat meat, I don't smoke.
[49:55.920 --> 49:57.720]  I drink occasionally, not right now though,
[49:57.720 --> 49:59.560]  because my doctor tells me I can't.
[49:59.560 --> 50:01.520]  Aside from probably not getting enough sleep
[50:01.520 --> 50:03.640]  and working too much, I'm a pretty healthy person.
[50:03.640 --> 50:06.760]  But on that day, I was anything but.
[50:06.760 --> 50:08.160]  My husband drove me to the emergency room
[50:08.160 --> 50:11.480]  and from there, the nightmare that has been my January began.
[50:11.480 --> 50:13.120]  I was diagnosed with pericarditis,
[50:13.120 --> 50:15.760]  inflammation of the lining of my heart,
[50:15.760 --> 50:20.760]  brought on by a virus, a literal common cold.
[50:20.800 --> 50:22.960]  I also had fluid around my heart
[50:22.960 --> 50:24.520]  that had to be drained or else it could
[50:24.520 --> 50:26.440]  hinder the beating of my heart.
[50:26.440 --> 50:27.840]  I was hospitalized for four nights
[50:27.840 --> 50:29.640]  and transferred from a local hospital
[50:29.640 --> 50:33.080]  to NYU Langone here in New York City.
[50:33.080 --> 50:34.960]  On January 4th, I was finally discharged
[50:34.960 --> 50:36.760]  after doctors drained the fluid around my heart
[50:36.760 --> 50:38.480]  and I bounced out of the hospital.
[50:38.480 --> 50:39.680]  I couldn't get out of there fast enough.
[50:39.680 --> 50:42.400]  With the hopes, I was on the mend.
[50:42.400 --> 50:43.840]  But that was not the end.
[50:43.840 --> 50:45.240]  Three days later, I was readmitted
[50:45.240 --> 50:48.920]  when I felt a flutter in my heart, like a butterfly.
[50:48.920 --> 50:50.360]  It was inside my chest.
[50:50.360 --> 50:53.680]  They determined I had developed myocarditis,
[50:53.680 --> 50:56.960]  inflammation of the actual heart now,
[50:56.960 --> 50:57.920]  the heart muscle.
[50:58.800 --> 51:00.640]  I remember being separated through the emergency room
[51:00.640 --> 51:02.920]  and wondering, is this it?
[51:02.920 --> 51:04.640]  It wasn't, thank God.
[51:04.640 --> 51:06.760]  Instead, I spent five more days in the hospital
[51:06.760 --> 51:08.080]  where they ran a battery attest,
[51:08.080 --> 51:10.680]  adjusted my meds and made sure nothing else was.
[51:12.360 --> 51:15.040]  Okay, so that's Yasmin Vesuvium,
[51:15.040 --> 51:19.680]  develops pericarditis and then myocarditis,
[51:19.680 --> 51:23.280]  which is exactly what the document in October 2000
[51:23.280 --> 51:26.600]  from the CDC predicted these mRNA shots would do
[51:26.600 --> 51:29.400]  because they tested a similar shot on rats
[51:29.400 --> 51:30.440]  at the University of Texas
[51:30.440 --> 51:33.240]  under a program run by Obama and Fauci.
[51:35.000 --> 51:37.680]  But no, she says it's the common cold
[51:37.680 --> 51:38.800]  and it's just normal
[51:38.800 --> 51:41.880]  that you're all gonna have major heart problems now.
[51:41.880 --> 51:43.920]  And she'll take more shots till she dies.
[51:45.320 --> 51:48.320]  And her family, I guess, will never come to grips with it
[51:48.320 --> 51:51.360]  because they can't admit it's being done to them.
[51:52.880 --> 51:54.240]  Here's another example of Kober
[51:54.240 --> 51:57.280]  really laughing at his audience,
[51:57.280 --> 51:59.440]  who he knows will never take their mask off,
[52:01.160 --> 52:02.280]  but saying, hey, great news,
[52:02.280 --> 52:04.880]  Biden is saying it will be over in the summer.
[52:06.000 --> 52:07.400]  Just a few more months
[52:07.400 --> 52:09.280]  and then Biden will lift the emergency.
[52:11.320 --> 52:12.640]  Here's Kober.
[52:12.640 --> 52:14.720]  Here's you tonight, breathing easy
[52:14.720 --> 52:16.560]  because the White House has finally announced
[52:16.560 --> 52:20.720]  they plan to end the COVID public health emergency in May.
[52:20.720 --> 52:23.200]  Take that COVID, we beat you.
[52:23.200 --> 52:25.640]  Shove that up your nose and rotate it five times.
[52:25.640 --> 52:29.200]  This has been a long time coming.
[52:29.200 --> 52:30.440]  I wish you could see the smiles
[52:30.440 --> 52:32.160]  on the faces of my audience.
[52:32.160 --> 52:33.640]  And I wish I could too
[52:33.640 --> 52:35.600]  because they're still wearing masks.
[52:38.240 --> 52:39.480]  The end is near.
[52:40.800 --> 52:42.040]  The end is near.
[52:42.040 --> 52:43.480]  This is a huge moment.
[52:43.480 --> 52:46.160]  After all the COVID, we've all been through.
[52:46.160 --> 52:49.840]  The Delta variant, Omicron, Omicron BA2,
[52:49.840 --> 52:54.840]  XBB 0.1.5, Z95, the home of classic.
[52:57.320 --> 53:00.040]  So there he is, laughing at them as they all cheer.
[53:00.040 --> 53:02.960]  We're still wearing our mask, yay.
[53:02.960 --> 53:05.040]  Even though what we told you two and a half years ago
[53:05.040 --> 53:08.680]  is now confirmed by another major study,
[53:08.680 --> 53:12.080]  mass-appear reviewed mass study shows little to no difference
[53:12.080 --> 53:14.480]  in preventing COVID and flu infection with the mask
[53:14.480 --> 53:19.480]  and of course increase of bacterial pneumonia
[53:19.480 --> 53:20.760]  that breed in the mask.
[53:20.760 --> 53:23.440]  And you don't get as much of the natural flora
[53:23.440 --> 53:26.360]  that's out there so your body lowers its immunity
[53:26.360 --> 53:28.760]  while you wear a mask as well.
[53:30.600 --> 53:33.440]  A massive international research collaboration
[53:33.440 --> 53:35.840]  that analyzed several dozen rigorous studies
[53:35.840 --> 53:37.800]  focusing on physical interventions
[53:37.800 --> 53:40.320]  against COVID-19 influenza found that they provide
[53:40.320 --> 53:44.800]  little to no protection against infection or illness rates.
[53:44.800 --> 53:46.960]  But don't worry, that's at least better than the shots
[53:46.960 --> 53:49.160]  that lower your immunity and increase infection
[53:49.160 --> 53:51.360]  and hospitalization and death.
[53:51.360 --> 53:54.240]  But those under Stockholm syndrome don't care,
[53:54.240 --> 53:57.280]  it's their security blanket.
[53:57.280 --> 53:59.320]  Bills provide for imprisonment
[53:59.320 --> 54:02.040]  for those who doubt vaccines in Brazil.
[54:02.040 --> 54:03.680]  And guess who it's sponsored by?
[54:03.680 --> 54:06.360]  Guess who's funding the politicians?
[54:06.360 --> 54:09.080]  That's right, Pfizer and others.
[54:09.080 --> 54:13.320]  They don't want you to be able to speak out
[54:13.320 --> 54:15.360]  against what they're assaulting us with.
[54:15.360 --> 54:17.440]  FDA advisor inadvertently confirms
[54:17.440 --> 54:19.880]  that Pfizer is doing gain of function research.
[54:19.880 --> 54:22.760]  That's up on infowars.com.
[54:22.760 --> 54:27.080]  And it goes on and on from there.
[54:27.080 --> 54:30.000]  What a time to be alive.
[54:30.000 --> 54:32.280]  I want to give the number out.
[54:32.280 --> 54:34.800]  I'm going to take a ton of calls today.
[54:34.800 --> 54:36.000]  I've already raised the issue
[54:36.000 --> 54:37.920]  of mass Stockholm syndrome, mind control.
[54:37.920 --> 54:40.440]  How do we get people out of it?
[54:40.440 --> 54:41.680]  We're going to start the next hour.
[54:41.680 --> 54:43.600]  I'm going to cover the big mind control news.
[54:43.600 --> 54:45.080]  I just set the table so far
[54:45.080 --> 54:47.160]  and then we're going right to your calls.
[54:47.160 --> 54:50.160]  Take me about 10 minutes to cover these stacks right here
[54:50.160 --> 54:53.320]  that are so critical and who's behind the mind control.
[54:53.320 --> 54:54.400]  And then we'll go to your phone calls.
[54:54.400 --> 54:59.400]  The toll free number to join us is 877-789-2539.
[55:00.240 --> 55:01.280]  There it is.
[55:01.280 --> 55:05.840]  1-877-789-2539.
[55:05.840 --> 55:08.040]  Remember the old cartoons when you were a kid,
[55:08.040 --> 55:08.880]  the black and white ones,
[55:08.880 --> 55:10.200]  you were old enough to remember those
[55:10.200 --> 55:11.960]  where it followed a bouncing ball,
[55:11.960 --> 55:12.920]  taught kids how to read.
[55:12.920 --> 55:14.040]  I can read by the time I was five,
[55:14.040 --> 55:15.760]  pretty good because of those cartoons.
[55:15.760 --> 55:16.600]  They don't have those now.
[55:16.600 --> 55:18.240]  I don't want you to know how to read.
[55:18.240 --> 55:22.360]  1-877-789-2539.
[55:22.360 --> 55:27.320]  877-789-2539.
[55:27.320 --> 55:29.600]  And we are taking your phone calls.
[55:29.600 --> 55:31.400]  You know, back then when they had black and white cartoons,
[55:31.400 --> 55:34.360]  teach your kids how to write, teach your kids how to read.
[55:35.360 --> 55:38.720]  They also put iodine in the salt
[55:38.720 --> 55:42.040]  and it raised IQs on average in the US within a decade
[55:42.040 --> 55:46.000]  once they started in the late 20s by 15 points.
[55:46.000 --> 55:47.480]  Oh, but the government made sure
[55:47.480 --> 55:49.480]  it got taken out in the late 70s
[55:49.480 --> 55:52.560]  with new policies of Henry Kissinger,
[55:52.560 --> 55:54.640]  saying we want to adulterate the food and water
[55:54.640 --> 55:56.920]  to lower IQs to make them more manageable
[55:56.920 --> 55:59.200]  and we want to wipe out at least 80%
[55:59.200 --> 56:00.440]  of the world's population.
[56:00.440 --> 56:01.880]  Now they haven't gotten around to that,
[56:01.880 --> 56:03.080]  they slowed the rate,
[56:03.080 --> 56:04.960]  but that's where we're all living.
[56:04.960 --> 56:06.560]  That's what we're all under.
[56:06.560 --> 56:07.920]  That's what we're dealing with.
[56:07.920 --> 56:09.240]  So, first time callers,
[56:09.240 --> 56:11.240]  callers that haven't called in a long time,
[56:11.240 --> 56:12.440]  callers that have never called,
[56:12.440 --> 56:13.240]  callers that agree,
[56:13.240 --> 56:14.360]  callers that want to make a point,
[56:14.360 --> 56:15.360]  callers that disagree,
[56:15.360 --> 56:17.360]  callers that have a question for me
[56:17.360 --> 56:18.960]  or questions for other callers.
[56:18.960 --> 56:20.640]  I love the free-for-all,
[56:20.640 --> 56:21.920]  I love the nature of it
[56:21.920 --> 56:24.160]  and we're just talking about this mind control planet
[56:24.160 --> 56:25.160]  and how to get out of it,
[56:25.160 --> 56:26.680]  and how to stop World War III
[56:26.680 --> 56:28.440]  and just how to get our energy turned back on
[56:28.440 --> 56:29.800]  and how to identify the people
[56:29.800 --> 56:31.480]  that are openly predatory,
[56:31.480 --> 56:34.360]  coming after us and assaulting every basic form
[56:34.360 --> 56:37.540]  of liberty and security and human decency.
[56:38.640 --> 56:43.640]  It's all coming up in the next hour, two hours.
[56:43.640 --> 56:47.960]  In fact, two plus hours of phone calls straight ahead.
[56:47.960 --> 56:48.800]  Please don't forget,

[57:03.040 --> 57:04.640]  so many about to sell out,
[57:04.640 --> 57:05.880]  so we've got to end the sale
[57:05.880 --> 57:08.080]  because it's basically store-wide on the supplements.
[57:08.080 --> 57:10.560]  On Monday, we'll still have some sales going,
[57:10.560 --> 57:12.360]  but a lot of the stuff's about to sell out.

[57:54.960 --> 57:57.280]  I'm 45, and I have bits.
[57:57.280 --> 58:00.600]  I go to the gym, and I have bits that won't move.
[58:00.600 --> 58:03.320]  And Diet Force has helped me move those bits.
[58:03.320 --> 58:06.880]  Like, under my pack, my belly,

[58:50.320 --> 58:52.720]  The good news is, the real Red Pill Plus,
[58:52.720 --> 58:54.720]  after over two years being sold out,
[58:54.720 --> 58:56.560]  because the key ingredients are not available,
[58:56.560 --> 58:57.920]  the supply chain breakdowns,
[58:57.920 --> 59:00.320]  is finally back in stock in the last month.
[59:00.320 --> 59:02.440]  The bad news is, we did a limited run of it,
[59:02.440 --> 59:03.960]  and it's almost sold out.
[59:03.960 --> 59:06.360]  So, we're in late January when I'm cutting this,

[59:22.960 --> 59:25.160]  I learned about it from a research scientist

[59:27.280 --> 59:28.320]  five years ago.

[59:51.440 --> 59:54.240]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies
[59:54.240 --> 59:57.840]  of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[59:57.840 --> 01:00:02.840]  The Destruction of America from Within
[01:00:02.840 --> 01:00:05.840]  has been going on for over 200 years.
[01:00:05.840 --> 01:00:08.840]  Seven years after the American Revolution,
[01:00:08.840 --> 01:00:11.840]  the Paris Peace Treaty of 1783
[01:00:11.840 --> 01:00:13.840]  established the King of England
[01:00:13.840 --> 01:00:16.840]  as the Prince-Elector of the United States,
[01:00:16.840 --> 01:00:20.840]  and America continued paying debts to the Crown.
[01:00:20.840 --> 01:00:23.840]  The United States, the United States,
[01:00:23.840 --> 01:00:27.840]  and America continued paying debts to the Crown.
[01:00:27.840 --> 01:00:29.840]  During the War of 1812,
[01:00:29.840 --> 01:00:32.840]  the British torched the White House.
[01:00:32.840 --> 01:00:36.840]  The Act of 1871 created a separate corporate government
[01:00:36.840 --> 01:00:38.840]  for the District of Columbia,
[01:00:38.840 --> 01:00:41.840]  allowing it to operate with its own laws
[01:00:41.840 --> 01:00:43.840]  outside of the U.S. Constitution,
[01:00:43.840 --> 01:00:47.840]  creating the corporation of the United States
[01:00:47.840 --> 01:00:50.840]  and a new city-state for the Old World Order
[01:00:50.840 --> 01:00:53.840]  with its financial capital in the City of London,
[01:00:53.840 --> 01:00:56.840]  its religious capital in Vatican City,
[01:00:56.840 --> 01:00:59.840]  and its military capital in the District of Columbia.
[01:00:59.840 --> 01:01:03.840]  These city-states have their own sovereignty.
[01:01:03.840 --> 01:01:07.840]  In 1913, the Federal Reserve Act gave full control
[01:01:07.840 --> 01:01:10.840]  of America's wealth to a private corporation
[01:01:10.840 --> 01:01:13.840]  beholden to the City of London.
[01:01:13.840 --> 01:01:15.840]  During the Nuremberg trials,
[01:01:15.840 --> 01:01:18.840]  only 19 were found guilty,
[01:01:18.840 --> 01:01:21.840]  while hundreds of Nazi war criminals
[01:01:21.840 --> 01:01:23.840]  were given jobs in the United States
[01:01:23.840 --> 01:01:26.840]  military-industrial complex.
[01:01:26.840 --> 01:01:28.840]  If you were to search online
[01:01:28.840 --> 01:01:32.840]  for just about any Middle Eastern country in the 1950s,
[01:01:32.840 --> 01:01:34.840]  you will see what the region looked like
[01:01:34.840 --> 01:01:38.840]  before British Petroleum, the CIA, and the Mossad
[01:01:38.840 --> 01:01:42.840]  turned it into a hellhole of radical Islamic rule.
[01:01:42.840 --> 01:01:45.840]  Placing psychotic puppets in power,
[01:01:45.840 --> 01:01:48.840]  the Old World Order then used it as a catalyst
[01:01:48.840 --> 01:01:51.840]  for the war against terror,
[01:01:51.840 --> 01:01:54.840]  which was then used to destabilize the region
[01:01:54.840 --> 01:01:57.840]  and create the catalyst for mass migration
[01:01:57.840 --> 01:01:59.840]  into Europe and America.
[01:01:59.840 --> 01:02:01.840]  Many Americans refused to recognize
[01:02:01.840 --> 01:02:04.840]  the endless crimes against humanity
[01:02:04.840 --> 01:02:06.840]  being committed by our own government,
[01:02:06.840 --> 01:02:10.840]  and so, by default, they blindly supported.
[01:02:10.840 --> 01:02:12.840]  Even when the American government
[01:02:12.840 --> 01:02:16.840]  stopped funding bioweapons labs around the Russian border,
[01:02:16.840 --> 01:02:18.840]  many Americans turned a blind eye,
[01:02:18.840 --> 01:02:20.840]  and so now the majority of the world
[01:02:20.840 --> 01:02:23.840]  stands with Russia and see America
[01:02:23.840 --> 01:02:26.840]  as the main threat against humanity.
[01:02:26.840 --> 01:02:30.840]  A new video produced by Russia's Wagner private military
[01:02:30.840 --> 01:02:33.840]  is now recruiting Americans to join them
[01:02:33.840 --> 01:02:36.840]  in their fight against the United States,
[01:02:36.840 --> 01:02:38.840]  pointing out how the United States
[01:02:38.840 --> 01:02:40.840]  has become a force of evil
[01:02:40.840 --> 01:02:44.840]  and is no longer what our forefathers intended it to be.
[01:02:44.840 --> 01:02:47.840]  You were a hero to your country,
[01:02:47.840 --> 01:02:50.840]  giving your best years in the army.
[01:02:50.840 --> 01:02:52.840]  You dreamed of defeating evil.
[01:02:52.840 --> 01:02:56.840]  You dreamed of doing much to make America great again.
[01:03:04.840 --> 01:03:07.840]  But in reality, you saw criminal odors,
[01:03:07.840 --> 01:03:11.840]  the destruction of nations, the death of civilians,
[01:03:11.840 --> 01:03:14.840]  and all for the will of a bunch of families
[01:03:14.840 --> 01:03:16.840]  who thought they were earthly gods,
[01:03:16.840 --> 01:03:19.840]  deciding who would live under the Europe
[01:03:19.840 --> 01:03:40.840]  and who would be destroyed.
[01:03:40.840 --> 01:03:44.840]  You began to realize that this is the side of evil.
[01:03:44.840 --> 01:03:48.840]  This is not the America the founding fathers dreamed of.
[01:03:48.840 --> 01:03:50.840]  It has become the focus of the evil
[01:03:50.840 --> 01:03:53.840]  that is destroying the whole world.
[01:03:53.840 --> 01:03:57.840]  And today, the only country fighting this evil is Russia.
[01:04:05.840 --> 01:04:09.840]  If you're a true patriot of the very future Great America,
[01:04:09.840 --> 01:04:12.840]  join the ranks of the warriors of Russia.
[01:04:12.840 --> 01:04:22.840]  Help defeat evil or it will be too late for everyone.
[01:04:22.840 --> 01:04:25.840]  If Americans were as righteous as we think we are,
[01:04:25.840 --> 01:04:28.840]  then we would not stand for such a corrupt government,
[01:04:28.840 --> 01:04:32.840]  wreaking havoc on the rest of the world in our name.
[01:04:32.840 --> 01:04:36.840]  Instead, most of us are content fighting each other
[01:04:36.840 --> 01:04:38.840]  and turning a blind eye.
[01:04:38.840 --> 01:04:41.840]  Reporting for Infowars, this is Greg Rees.
[01:04:41.840 --> 01:04:44.840]  Well, that's a powerful...
[01:04:44.840 --> 01:04:46.840]  That's a powerful report.
[01:04:46.840 --> 01:04:49.840]  We're going to be getting to that when we come back,
[01:04:49.840 --> 01:04:51.840]  ladies and gentlemen.
[01:04:51.840 --> 01:04:55.840]  We're going to be going to your phone calls on the other side.
[01:04:55.840 --> 01:04:57.840]  Sorry, folks, I have somebody talking to my hair there.
[01:04:57.840 --> 01:04:59.840]  Say it with us.
[01:04:59.840 --> 01:05:01.840]  The cavalry has arrived.
[01:05:01.840 --> 01:05:06.840]  Ultimate bone broth is the strongest, highest quality
[01:05:06.840 --> 01:05:08.840]  chicken-based bone broth you're going to find

[01:05:13.840 --> 01:05:15.840]  your immune system.
[01:05:15.840 --> 01:05:17.840]  Everybody knows about grandma and chicken broth.
[01:05:17.840 --> 01:05:19.840]  Well, this is concentrated chicken broth,
[01:05:19.840 --> 01:05:22.840]  the strongest out there with chocolate mushroom,
[01:05:22.840 --> 01:05:24.840]  and a whole bunch of other ingredients,

[01:06:19.840 --> 01:06:22.840]  dozens of different breaking news items
[01:06:22.840 --> 01:06:25.840]  that all tie together,
[01:06:25.840 --> 01:06:28.840]  and then we have the New World Order's own statements about
[01:06:28.840 --> 01:06:30.840]  how they want us domesticated, they want us controlled,
[01:06:30.840 --> 01:06:33.840]  they don't want us to know how to take care of ourselves
[01:06:33.840 --> 01:06:35.840]  so that we will accept this whole nightmare
[01:06:35.840 --> 01:06:38.840]  transhumanist depopulation goal.
[01:06:38.840 --> 01:06:42.840]  And the mind control is public in the western world,
[01:06:42.840 --> 01:06:46.840]  from North America all the way out of the Pacific Ocean
[01:06:46.840 --> 01:06:50.840]  in Australia and New Zealand, through Europe, through the UK.
[01:06:50.840 --> 01:06:54.840]  It was the military intelligence operations
[01:06:54.840 --> 01:06:58.840]  working with Big Tech to quote,
[01:06:58.840 --> 01:07:02.840]  terrorize, brainwash, scare the public
[01:07:02.840 --> 01:07:05.840]  into accepting mask lockdowns and the shots.
[01:07:05.840 --> 01:07:08.840]  It was all a giant drill of submission.
[01:07:08.840 --> 01:07:11.840]  Don't have to believe me, just put it into a search engine.
[01:07:11.840 --> 01:07:14.840]  Ministry of Defense used propaganda
[01:07:14.840 --> 01:07:18.840]  to scare public into accepting covid lockdowns
[01:07:18.840 --> 01:07:20.840]  or accepting the shots,
[01:07:20.840 --> 01:07:22.840]  and the same headlines are in the US,
[01:07:22.840 --> 01:07:24.840]  the same headlines are in New Zealand,
[01:07:24.840 --> 01:07:26.840]  the same headlines are in Canada.
[01:07:26.840 --> 01:07:28.840]  All unified.
[01:07:28.840 --> 01:07:30.840]  And I told you about this even before it was in the news,
[01:07:30.840 --> 01:07:33.840]  and I told you it's Big Tech working with big corporations
[01:07:33.840 --> 01:07:35.840]  and the military to do this.
[01:07:35.840 --> 01:07:37.840]  And of course then they targeted the military
[01:07:37.840 --> 01:07:39.840]  with the forced injections more than anybody.
[01:07:39.840 --> 01:07:42.840]  So I criticized the military, it's not the military,
[01:07:42.840 --> 01:07:44.840]  the men and women in the military,
[01:07:44.840 --> 01:07:46.840]  it is the globalist running it,
[01:07:46.840 --> 01:07:49.840]  using it as a laboratory of control
[01:07:49.840 --> 01:07:51.840]  and social engineering and transgenderism
[01:07:51.840 --> 01:07:53.840]  and critical race theory,
[01:07:53.840 --> 01:07:56.840]  and all the rest of the brainwashing and garbage that goes on.
[01:07:56.840 --> 01:07:58.840]  So there's a big report here,
[01:07:58.840 --> 01:08:01.840]  DOD adds cognitive security
[01:08:01.840 --> 01:08:04.840]  to governmental disinformation campaign.
[01:08:04.840 --> 01:08:07.840]  And when you read the big report,
[01:08:07.840 --> 01:08:11.840]  it shows shots of the Pentagon report that's public,
[01:08:11.840 --> 01:08:14.840]  the three dimensions of information environment.
[01:08:14.840 --> 01:08:18.840]  Physical dimensional, informational dimension,
[01:08:18.840 --> 01:08:22.840]  that's the propaganda, and cognitive dimension, the brain.
[01:08:22.840 --> 01:08:24.840]  And the Pentagon talks about using electromagnetic waves
[01:08:24.840 --> 01:08:26.840]  to control your brain.
[01:08:26.840 --> 01:08:28.840]  The Pentagon talks about using chemicals to control your brain.
[01:08:28.840 --> 01:08:32.840]  The Pentagon talks about using the information dimension
[01:08:32.840 --> 01:08:34.840]  to program the brain.
[01:08:34.840 --> 01:08:37.840]  And then the physical control of the computers,
[01:08:37.840 --> 01:08:40.840]  control of the energy, control of the resources.
[01:08:40.840 --> 01:08:44.840]  And it's all in here how they're launching this cognitive security
[01:08:44.840 --> 01:08:49.840]  to create security.
[01:08:49.840 --> 01:08:51.840]  They must control our minds for our own good.
[01:08:51.840 --> 01:08:53.840]  And they have an upside-down American flag
[01:08:53.840 --> 01:08:55.840]  that represents misinformation.
[01:08:55.840 --> 01:08:57.840]  America's in trouble when there's misinformation.
[01:08:57.840 --> 01:08:59.840]  That means anything challenging the globalist
[01:08:59.840 --> 01:09:02.840]  to control the Pentagon's narrative.
[01:09:02.840 --> 01:09:05.840]  Disinformation.
[01:09:05.840 --> 01:09:07.840]  So it's not just X's on the American flag.
[01:09:07.840 --> 01:09:11.840]  Now it's an explosion on an upside-down flag.
[01:09:11.840 --> 01:09:15.840]  So misinformation's bad,
[01:09:15.840 --> 01:09:19.840]  and it shows the states turned into X's instead of stars,
[01:09:19.840 --> 01:09:21.840]  when really it's the globalist getting rid of the country itself,
[01:09:21.840 --> 01:09:22.840]  not just the states.
[01:09:22.840 --> 01:09:24.840]  So everything we're saying is inverted.
[01:09:24.840 --> 01:09:27.840]  Really, our so-called misinformation, disinformation,
[01:09:27.840 --> 01:09:29.840]  is the truth.
[01:09:29.840 --> 01:09:31.840]  So it's a upright flag.
[01:09:31.840 --> 01:09:33.840]  It's a flag in its proper position.
[01:09:33.840 --> 01:09:35.840]  But instead they have it as a flag destroyed.
[01:09:35.840 --> 01:09:40.840]  Then they talk about malinformation.
[01:09:40.840 --> 01:09:42.840]  So ladies and gentlemen, you need to read this for yourself.
[01:09:42.840 --> 01:09:44.840]  You need to go see the Pentagon report.
[01:09:44.840 --> 01:09:47.840]  I'm going to put a link to this on infowars.com,
[01:09:47.840 --> 01:09:49.840]  the live show feed under it.
[01:09:49.840 --> 01:09:51.840]  So you can read this for yourself
[01:09:51.840 --> 01:09:56.840]  and just see how chilling this is.
[01:09:56.840 --> 01:10:01.840]  It goes on to say that they are going to have to control
[01:10:01.840 --> 01:10:04.840]  all the information to basically keep us safe
[01:10:04.840 --> 01:10:05.840]  and control us.
[01:10:05.840 --> 01:10:07.840]  And it talks about the oversight
[01:10:07.840 --> 01:10:10.840]  and what components are.
[01:10:10.840 --> 01:10:15.840]  Well, who are the oversight groups they mentioned?
[01:10:15.840 --> 01:10:17.840]  Well, they want to control your hometown news,
[01:10:17.840 --> 01:10:21.840]  your social media activity, commercial satellite imagery,
[01:10:21.840 --> 01:10:23.840]  hometown school announcement plan
[01:10:23.840 --> 01:10:25.840]  to create patriotic signs,
[01:10:25.840 --> 01:10:28.840]  which is now the whole LGBT thing.
[01:10:28.840 --> 01:10:29.840]  That's the new American flag.
[01:10:29.840 --> 01:10:31.840]  Social media traffic applications,
[01:10:31.840 --> 01:10:34.840]  local paper announcements, global media,
[01:10:34.840 --> 01:10:42.840]  local, foreign citizens being controlled.
[01:10:42.840 --> 01:10:47.840]  And then it goes through who is going to be trusted information.
[01:10:47.840 --> 01:10:51.840]  Old dinosaur media, think tanks, big tech,
[01:10:51.840 --> 01:10:53.840]  the Pentagon regurgitating it,
[01:10:53.840 --> 01:10:56.840]  NGOs, the Southern Prairie Law Center,
[01:10:56.840 --> 01:11:00.840]  the ADL and the Clinton Initiative,
[01:11:00.840 --> 01:11:03.840]  and Bill Gates' News Guard Initiative.
[01:11:03.840 --> 01:11:05.840]  Here's an article on it today.
[01:11:05.840 --> 01:11:10.840]  Chelsea Clinton is part of a group pushing
[01:11:10.840 --> 01:11:12.840]  for a World Health Organization
[01:11:12.840 --> 01:11:15.840]  to combat online misinformation.
[01:11:15.840 --> 01:11:18.840]  And they have a treaty to enforce it
[01:11:18.840 --> 01:11:21.840]  and we have the head of the EU threatening to arrest Elon Musk
[01:11:21.840 --> 01:11:22.840]  who he doesn't submit.
[01:11:22.840 --> 01:11:24.840]  That's how far along this is.
[01:11:24.840 --> 01:11:27.840]  Breaking, meta lost 13.7 billion
[01:11:27.840 --> 01:11:30.840]  on Mark Zuckerberg's metaverse bet.
[01:11:30.840 --> 01:11:37.840]  Well, Hollywood lost even more with all its wokeism last year.
[01:11:37.840 --> 01:11:40.840]  But they still did it because it's a weapons system.
[01:11:40.840 --> 01:11:41.840]  It's not just there to make money.
[01:11:41.840 --> 01:11:45.840]  It's there to control and destabilize society.
[01:11:45.840 --> 01:11:48.840]  And the Pentagon gets into forcing you into inward comb
[01:11:48.840 --> 01:11:53.840]  and the metaverse and an entire false universe they control.
[01:11:53.840 --> 01:11:54.840]  Here's a Fox News report.
[01:11:54.840 --> 01:11:59.840]  China is laughing as U.S. culture war erodes combat readiness
[01:11:59.840 --> 01:12:01.840]  to its former Defense Secretary.
[01:12:01.840 --> 01:12:02.840]  Absolutely true.
[01:12:02.840 --> 01:12:04.840]  But again, that's part of the plan.
[01:12:04.840 --> 01:12:09.840]  It forces us onto a robot army by destroying the human army.
[01:12:09.840 --> 01:12:10.840]  That gets into the mind control.
[01:12:10.840 --> 01:12:16.840]  Lett is triggered by old Mr. Rogers, boys or girls, girls or girls clips.
[01:12:16.840 --> 01:12:18.840]  Again, boys or boys, girls or girls clips
[01:12:18.840 --> 01:12:20.840]  because they can't have anything
[01:12:20.840 --> 01:12:23.840]  that goes against their gas-lighting narrative.
[01:12:23.840 --> 01:12:25.840]  Here's the article I mentioned earlier from Town Hall.
[01:12:25.840 --> 01:12:31.840]  Oh, so that's why Catholic students got kicked out of the Smithsonian.
[01:12:31.840 --> 01:12:33.840]  The Smithsonian National and Space Museum,
[01:12:33.840 --> 01:12:34.840]  it's one of their better ones,
[01:12:34.840 --> 01:12:37.840]  kicked out a dozen Catholic school students
[01:12:37.840 --> 01:12:41.840]  and their chaperones for wearing beanies inscribed with pro-life messages.
[01:12:41.840 --> 01:12:43.840]  And the government's defending it saying,
[01:12:43.840 --> 01:12:46.840]  your free speech is not allowed.
[01:12:46.840 --> 01:12:50.840]  That's just one example today of the totally un-American tyranny.
[01:12:50.840 --> 01:12:52.840]  But what else are they doing to upset?
[01:12:52.840 --> 01:12:55.840]  Not just saying boys can be girls and girls can be boys
[01:12:55.840 --> 01:12:59.840]  and two men can have a baby and all this murder of logic.
[01:12:59.840 --> 01:13:04.840]  I would talk about human animal hybrids and animal animal and animal insect
[01:13:04.840 --> 01:13:08.840]  and animal plant hybrids that were in mainline literature 25 years ago,
[01:13:08.840 --> 01:13:09.840]  26, 27 years ago.
[01:13:09.840 --> 01:13:12.840]  People thought I was crazy even though I had MIT reports.
[01:13:12.840 --> 01:13:13.840]  But now it's all over the news.
[01:13:13.840 --> 01:13:15.840]  Oh, hey, we're mixing plants with animals.
[01:13:15.840 --> 01:13:19.840]  Hey, we put insects into salmon that are on store shelves now for four years.
[01:13:19.840 --> 01:13:23.840]  Hey, this is just the sun reporting.
[01:13:23.840 --> 01:13:25.840]  Scientists inject fish with alligator DNA
[01:13:25.840 --> 01:13:30.840]  to create mutant creatures that live longer.
[01:13:30.840 --> 01:13:32.840]  What could go wrong?
[01:13:32.840 --> 01:13:35.840]  Told you this was coming decades ago.
[01:13:35.840 --> 01:13:41.840]  Transhumanism is all about creating new humanoid creatures
[01:13:41.840 --> 01:13:43.840]  that you all know Harari's talking about now
[01:13:43.840 --> 01:13:45.840]  that won't have any rights.
[01:13:45.840 --> 01:13:46.840]  It'll be programmable,
[01:13:46.840 --> 01:13:49.840]  but they'll be deployed into society
[01:13:49.840 --> 01:13:52.840]  and the lower classes will have to submit to them,
[01:13:52.840 --> 01:13:54.840]  but they'll still be owned and programmed
[01:13:54.840 --> 01:13:56.840]  and trojan hoarse by the corporations.
[01:13:56.840 --> 01:13:57.840]  And the big thing is what they say,
[01:13:57.840 --> 01:13:59.840]  oh, we're going to arrest you if you misgender somebody
[01:13:59.840 --> 01:14:01.840]  or if you say a man's really a man.
[01:14:01.840 --> 01:14:03.840]  That's getting you ready when they say,
[01:14:03.840 --> 01:14:04.840]  oh, you can really live forever.
[01:14:04.840 --> 01:14:06.840]  You just upload your brain to a computer
[01:14:06.840 --> 01:14:08.840]  and they're going to certify that that's an identity,
[01:14:08.840 --> 01:14:11.840]  that that has rights just like they say corporations have rights.
[01:14:11.840 --> 01:14:14.840]  But now it's going to be fat similes,
[01:14:14.840 --> 01:14:16.840]  brain prints, voice prints,
[01:14:16.840 --> 01:14:18.840]  everything you said or did recorded.
[01:14:18.840 --> 01:14:20.840]  It'll be able to fool your family that it's you
[01:14:20.840 --> 01:14:22.840]  talking to them, but it's not you
[01:14:22.840 --> 01:14:27.840]  and it's owned and controlled your psychic cultural knowledge
[01:14:27.840 --> 01:14:32.840]  by the corporation where you've uploaded this avatar.
[01:14:32.840 --> 01:14:34.840]  And now that's going to have rights
[01:14:34.840 --> 01:14:37.840]  and they're saying you can't say that that really doesn't have a soul
[01:14:37.840 --> 01:14:40.840]  or the soul doesn't exist.
[01:14:40.840 --> 01:14:42.840]  And now they're rolling it out as that.
[01:14:42.840 --> 01:14:46.840]  You'll soon be able to talk to dead relatives in the metaverse
[01:14:46.840 --> 01:14:49.840]  after chat GPT breakthrough.
[01:14:49.840 --> 01:14:50.840]  We'll get more to this later.
[01:14:50.840 --> 01:14:52.840]  I don't want to start getting your calls,
[01:14:52.840 --> 01:14:54.840]  but that's what we're dealing with.
[01:14:54.840 --> 01:14:58.840]  And that's how this revolution against humanity is operating.
[01:14:58.840 --> 01:15:00.840]  And look, you're choosing, this is key,
[01:15:00.840 --> 01:15:02.840]  to say I don't like the metaverse.
[01:15:02.840 --> 01:15:04.840]  Kids hate it, adults hate it, nobody's buying into it.
[01:15:04.840 --> 01:15:06.840]  They force feed it, depending on force feeds it.
[01:15:06.840 --> 01:15:08.840]  You're saying I don't want to believe
[01:15:08.840 --> 01:15:10.840]  that this computer really has a consciousness.
[01:15:10.840 --> 01:15:12.840]  It doesn't, it's a scam.
[01:15:12.840 --> 01:15:14.840]  It doesn't matter they're going to say you're going to be penalized
[01:15:14.840 --> 01:15:15.840]  if you don't believe it.
[01:15:15.840 --> 01:15:20.840]  The whole thing is about getting you to accept
[01:15:20.840 --> 01:15:22.840]  all these new things they're going to create,
[01:15:22.840 --> 01:15:24.840]  all these new things they're going to do
[01:15:24.840 --> 01:15:26.840]  that they program and control
[01:15:26.840 --> 01:15:29.840]  and that you've got a bow down to.
[01:15:29.840 --> 01:15:31.840]  And then you can't say you're a mother or father.
[01:15:31.840 --> 01:15:33.840]  You can't say you're a boy or girl.
[01:15:33.840 --> 01:15:35.840]  You can't on literature in Canada and in the UK
[01:15:35.840 --> 01:15:38.840]  and many other countries say mother or father
[01:15:38.840 --> 01:15:40.840]  is the first grade entrance form.
[01:15:40.840 --> 01:15:42.840]  You don't have rights to say you're a man or woman,
[01:15:42.840 --> 01:15:44.840]  but everything else has a right.
[01:15:44.840 --> 01:15:46.840]  Computers have rights, robots have rights,
[01:15:46.840 --> 01:15:48.840]  clones have rights, replicants have rights,
[01:15:48.840 --> 01:15:50.840]  but you don't have rights.
[01:15:50.840 --> 01:15:52.840]  And remember, it's all controlled by the globalist,
[01:15:52.840 --> 01:15:53.840]  by the deep state.
[01:15:53.840 --> 01:15:55.840]  Your phone calls are a few minutes away.
[01:15:55.840 --> 01:15:57.840]  I'm going to write to you after break.
[01:15:57.840 --> 01:15:59.840]  Hey, what's up, Bond?
[01:15:59.840 --> 01:16:01.840]  Hey, McBreen. What's going on, man?
[01:16:01.840 --> 01:16:02.840]  I see.
[01:16:02.840 --> 01:16:05.840]  Hey, really like that work you did on the AI piece?
[01:16:05.840 --> 01:16:07.840]  I'm going to use that on the show today.
[01:16:07.840 --> 01:16:08.840]  No, I worked hard on that.
[01:16:08.840 --> 01:16:09.840]  I'm working on another project,
[01:16:09.840 --> 01:16:11.840]  so I'm going to be up late again tonight.
[01:16:11.840 --> 01:16:13.840]  I was hoping he had some brain force plus.
[01:16:13.840 --> 01:16:15.840]  Oh, um...
[01:16:15.840 --> 01:16:17.840]  No.
[01:16:17.840 --> 01:16:19.840]  I'm going to be late again tonight.
[01:16:19.840 --> 01:16:21.840]  I'm going to be late again tonight.
[01:16:21.840 --> 01:16:23.840]  I'm going to be late again tonight.
[01:16:23.840 --> 01:16:25.840]  I'm going to be late again tonight.
[01:16:25.840 --> 01:16:27.840]  No.
[01:16:27.840 --> 01:16:29.840]  Nothing.
[01:16:29.840 --> 01:16:31.840]  What about brain force ultra?
[01:16:31.840 --> 01:16:33.840]  Um...
[01:16:35.840 --> 01:16:37.840]  No.
[01:16:37.840 --> 01:16:39.840]  Okay.
[01:16:39.840 --> 01:16:41.840]  Thanks anyway.
[01:16:41.840 --> 01:16:54.840]  Good luck with that project, though.
[01:17:11.840 --> 01:17:14.840]  It turned out they were supplying almost all the raw materials
[01:17:14.840 --> 01:17:17.840]  to the companies that we were already using.
[01:17:17.840 --> 01:17:19.840]  So we've gone directly to the source,
[01:17:19.840 --> 01:17:21.840]  and that means we can give you lower prices
[01:17:21.840 --> 01:17:23.840]  on the very same high-quality supplements,
[01:17:23.840 --> 01:17:25.840]  and in some cases, even better.

[01:18:58.840 --> 01:19:01.840]  The good news is the real Red Pill Plus
[01:19:01.840 --> 01:19:03.840]  after over two years being sold out
[01:19:03.840 --> 01:19:05.840]  because the key ingredients are not available
[01:19:05.840 --> 01:19:07.840]  but supply chain breakdowns is finally back in stock
[01:19:07.840 --> 01:19:09.840]  in the last month.
[01:19:09.840 --> 01:19:11.840]  The bad news is we did a limited run of it
[01:19:11.840 --> 01:19:13.840]  and it's almost sold out.
[01:19:13.840 --> 01:19:15.840]  So we're in late January when I'm cutting this,
[01:19:15.840 --> 01:19:18.840]  only seven days left to get the real Red Pill Plus
[01:19:18.840 --> 01:19:20.840]  with all the key ingredients like preglinone and more

[01:19:31.840 --> 01:19:33.840]  I learned about it from a research scientist
[01:19:33.840 --> 01:19:35.840]  and a medical doctor who had a similar formula
[01:19:35.840 --> 01:19:38.840]  five years ago, we simply made it stronger
[01:19:38.840 --> 01:19:40.840]  and we have great reviews from listeners.

[01:19:49.840 --> 01:19:51.840]  The only way we fail is if you don't take action.
[01:19:51.840 --> 01:19:54.840]  Real Red Pill Plus now available at 50% off
[01:19:54.840 --> 01:20:01.840]  at infowarsstore.com for only a few more days.
[01:20:24.840 --> 01:20:26.840]  Ladies and gentlemen, we are back
[01:20:26.840 --> 01:20:29.840]  and we're about to go straight to your phone calls.
[01:20:29.840 --> 01:20:32.840]  I wanted to add one more point about the mind control.
[01:20:32.840 --> 01:20:34.840]  You're saying, well, I'll just go get a farm
[01:20:34.840 --> 01:20:35.840]  or I'll just go live in the country
[01:20:35.840 --> 01:20:37.840]  or I'll just be a carpenter.
[01:20:37.840 --> 01:20:39.840]  All the regulations are going in worldwide
[01:20:39.840 --> 01:20:41.840]  in every facet of society
[01:20:41.840 --> 01:20:43.840]  through the carbon taxes and more
[01:20:43.840 --> 01:20:45.840]  to shut down all small business.
[01:20:45.840 --> 01:20:49.840]  And so all of us have to religiously,
[01:20:49.840 --> 01:20:52.840]  anytime we can, support mom and pop,
[01:20:52.840 --> 01:20:57.840]  support thrift shops, support small farms,
[01:20:57.840 --> 01:20:59.840]  and if we do that, it will explode them
[01:20:59.840 --> 01:21:00.840]  and they won't be able to stop us.
[01:21:00.840 --> 01:21:02.840]  And I know I'm stating the obvious here,
[01:21:02.840 --> 01:21:04.840]  but there are entire attackers around that.
[01:21:04.840 --> 01:21:06.840]  And look, I like big box stores.
[01:21:06.840 --> 01:21:08.840]  I like fancy hotels.
[01:21:08.840 --> 01:21:11.840]  You know, I like flying first class on airplane.
[01:21:11.840 --> 01:21:13.840]  But at the end of the day,
[01:21:13.840 --> 01:21:16.840]  all of those big corporate things are predatory
[01:21:16.840 --> 01:21:17.840]  and are controlled by the globalists
[01:21:17.840 --> 01:21:20.840]  and are there to target humanity.
[01:21:20.840 --> 01:21:23.840]  And so I am really now, when I travel or go places,
[01:21:23.840 --> 01:21:26.840]  I try to go to the small place, the little place,
[01:21:26.840 --> 01:21:27.840]  the privately owned place.
[01:21:27.840 --> 01:21:30.840]  I try to go always to small restaurants.
[01:21:30.840 --> 01:21:33.840]  I never, never go to big chains anymore
[01:21:33.840 --> 01:21:35.840]  unless I'm in an airport and have to
[01:21:35.840 --> 01:21:38.840]  because they're owned by globalists, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:21:38.840 --> 01:21:39.840]  And I'll have friends in town.
[01:21:39.840 --> 01:21:41.840]  They go, hey, I'm staying at the Four Seasons.
[01:21:41.840 --> 01:21:42.840]  Come down, let's have dinner.
[01:21:42.840 --> 01:21:45.840]  And I go, I'm not going to eat at the Four Seasons.
[01:21:45.840 --> 01:21:46.840]  And they say, why?
[01:21:46.840 --> 01:21:48.840]  I go, it's owned by Bill Gates.
[01:21:48.840 --> 01:21:50.840]  Man, how do you know that?
[01:21:50.840 --> 01:21:52.840]  Wow, it is owned by Bill Gates.
[01:21:52.840 --> 01:21:54.840]  Then that's just it.
[01:21:54.840 --> 01:21:56.840]  So you've got to search engine
[01:21:56.840 --> 01:21:58.840]  and look at everywhere you're going to spend money.
[01:21:58.840 --> 01:22:00.840]  I mean, here's some examples.
[01:22:00.840 --> 01:22:01.840]  Great reset.
[01:22:01.840 --> 01:22:06.840]  Britain's faced 300 pound, up to 3,000 pound.
[01:22:06.840 --> 01:22:09.840]  So that's like $2,000 fines
[01:22:09.840 --> 01:22:12.840]  for burning wood to keep warm.
[01:22:12.840 --> 01:22:14.840]  Canadian government forces dairy farmer
[01:22:14.840 --> 01:22:18.840]  to dump 3,000 liters of milk
[01:22:18.840 --> 01:22:20.840]  because he extended his quota.
[01:22:20.840 --> 01:22:21.840]  Same thing, caps on production.
[01:22:21.840 --> 01:22:22.840]  Netherlands is doing it too.
[01:22:22.840 --> 01:22:24.840]  All under the UN.
[01:22:24.840 --> 01:22:26.840]  Hamburger prices might continue to rise
[01:22:26.840 --> 01:22:28.840]  as US cattle herd shrinks.
[01:22:28.840 --> 01:22:30.840]  It's all the regulations.
[01:22:30.840 --> 01:22:32.840]  And that's just the news today, folks.
[01:22:32.840 --> 01:22:33.840]  You're being screwed.
[01:22:33.840 --> 01:22:34.840]  You're being raped.
[01:22:34.840 --> 01:22:36.840]  Don't just get pissed about it.
[01:22:36.840 --> 01:22:38.840]  Do something about it.
[01:22:38.840 --> 01:22:40.840]  Listen, I'm going to go to your calls,
[01:22:40.840 --> 01:22:42.840]  but we have a ranch that's been in our family
[01:22:42.840 --> 01:22:45.840]  for a long time.
[01:22:45.840 --> 01:22:49.840]  Part of the property since the 1830s.
[01:22:49.840 --> 01:22:51.840]  Our family came into that area in the 1820s,
[01:22:51.840 --> 01:22:53.840]  but we've got a homestead
[01:22:53.840 --> 01:22:56.840]  and we've got a family cemetery.
[01:22:56.840 --> 01:22:58.840]  In fact, I'm going to go do a report there sometime.
[01:22:58.840 --> 01:23:00.840]  It'll blow you away.
[01:23:00.840 --> 01:23:02.840]  It actually is carved on the tombstones.
[01:23:02.840 --> 01:23:04.840]  It's almost, you can't hardly read it now,
[01:23:04.840 --> 01:23:08.840]  killed by Indians, you know, 1832 and stuff like that.
[01:23:08.840 --> 01:23:10.840]  Most of the gravestones are children
[01:23:10.840 --> 01:23:12.840]  because about half the kids died by age five
[01:23:12.840 --> 01:23:14.840]  back in those days.
[01:23:14.840 --> 01:23:16.840]  That was their idea of antibiotics.
[01:23:16.840 --> 01:23:18.840]  People were so tough,
[01:23:18.840 --> 01:23:21.840]  but there's hundreds of gravestones of my family
[01:23:21.840 --> 01:23:24.840]  right back behind my grandmother's old house
[01:23:24.840 --> 01:23:27.840]  that's got my cousins living in it.
[01:23:27.840 --> 01:23:29.840]  And part of the house is over 150 years old,
[01:23:29.840 --> 01:23:31.840]  just that house.
[01:23:31.840 --> 01:23:33.840]  I'm digressing.
[01:23:33.840 --> 01:23:35.840]  The point is when my dad was a child,
[01:23:35.840 --> 01:23:37.840]  they had ducks, they had chickens,
[01:23:37.840 --> 01:23:39.840]  they had pigs, they had cows, they had mules,
[01:23:39.840 --> 01:23:41.840]  they had horses.
[01:23:41.840 --> 01:23:43.840]  Everybody could do electrical.
[01:23:43.840 --> 01:23:45.840]  Everybody knew how to fix combines.
[01:23:45.840 --> 01:23:48.840]  Everybody knew how to shoot the eye out of a
[01:23:48.840 --> 01:23:50.840]  hawk if they wanted to.
[01:23:50.840 --> 01:23:52.840]  And you compare those people that are all dead
[01:23:52.840 --> 01:23:55.840]  and all gone and the brain trust of this country
[01:23:55.840 --> 01:23:57.840]  is the same everywhere.
[01:23:57.840 --> 01:24:00.840]  Well, guess what my dad's doing?
[01:24:00.840 --> 01:24:02.840]  He's got like a hundred cattle out there
[01:24:02.840 --> 01:24:04.840]  just for the tax exemption.
[01:24:04.840 --> 01:24:06.840]  He's going back into cattle production,
[01:24:06.840 --> 01:24:08.840]  back into a bunch of other production.
[01:24:08.840 --> 01:24:10.840]  A Christmas tree farm,
[01:24:10.840 --> 01:24:12.840]  they're putting in a bunch of stuff
[01:24:12.840 --> 01:24:14.840]  and my dad knows it's the thing to do
[01:24:14.840 --> 01:24:16.840]  and we're going back into agriculture.
[01:24:16.840 --> 01:24:18.840]  Balls of the walls.
[01:24:18.840 --> 01:24:20.840]  And because I'm not just going to sit here
[01:24:20.840 --> 01:24:22.840]  and run my mouth about how you need to do it
[01:24:22.840 --> 01:24:24.840]  and I'm not doing it.
[01:24:24.840 --> 01:24:26.840]  I am doing it.
[01:24:26.840 --> 01:24:28.840]  And so it's what you're meant to do.
[01:24:28.840 --> 01:24:30.840]  We need to do it.
[01:24:30.840 --> 01:24:32.840]  Pronto. All right, I'm going to shut up now, Jones.
[01:24:32.840 --> 01:24:34.840]  I'm going to go to your calls,
[01:24:34.840 --> 01:24:36.840]  but they're cutting off our damn energy.
[01:24:36.840 --> 01:24:38.840]  They're cutting off our food.
[01:24:38.840 --> 01:24:40.840]  The answer is buy local food,
[01:24:40.840 --> 01:24:42.840]  support local farmers,
[01:24:42.840 --> 01:24:44.840]  and the Amish and the Mennonites
[01:24:44.840 --> 01:24:46.840]  are the light to carry us out of this.
[01:24:46.840 --> 01:24:48.840]  You don't know where to move, folks.
[01:24:48.840 --> 01:24:50.840]  I would move close to them and work with them
[01:24:50.840 --> 01:24:52.840]  and copy them and get as close to that as you can,
[01:24:52.840 --> 01:24:54.840]  because that's all there's going to be in the future.
[01:24:54.840 --> 01:24:56.840]  We need big, giant, vibrant communities
[01:24:56.840 --> 01:24:58.840]  that show the way in the future
[01:24:58.840 --> 01:25:00.840]  with healthy children and healthy families.
[01:25:00.840 --> 01:25:02.840]  That's going to get very, very bad,
[01:25:02.840 --> 01:25:04.840]  very, very quickly, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:25:04.840 --> 01:25:06.840]  Get out of the cities. Get out of the cities.
[01:25:06.840 --> 01:25:08.840]  For those of us that will rearguard for everybody else,
[01:25:08.840 --> 01:25:10.840]  I'll still be in these cesspits
[01:25:10.840 --> 01:25:12.840]  of crime and homelessness
[01:25:12.840 --> 01:25:14.840]  and government corruption and drugs,
[01:25:14.840 --> 01:25:16.840]  but there's no way, no place to raise a child.
[01:25:16.840 --> 01:25:18.840]  And you'll be,
[01:25:18.840 --> 01:25:20.840]  you can be living in a shack.
[01:25:20.840 --> 01:25:22.840]  And if you got to work in town at the gas station
[01:25:22.840 --> 01:25:24.840]  to have a garden and learn how to do it
[01:25:24.840 --> 01:25:26.840]  and have a couple cows and get into it
[01:25:26.840 --> 01:25:28.840]  and be poor,
[01:25:28.840 --> 01:25:30.840]  and you'll be richer than the richest person
[01:25:30.840 --> 01:25:32.840]  living in some high-rise hill pit
[01:25:32.840 --> 01:25:34.840]  with 5G flooding your body.
[01:25:34.840 --> 01:25:36.840]  I'm ranting.
[01:25:36.840 --> 01:25:38.840]  All right, we're going to Chris at Kentucky, everybody else.
[01:25:38.840 --> 01:25:40.840]  Chris at Kentucky, thanks for holding it on the air.
[01:25:40.840 --> 01:25:42.840]  Thanks for taking my call, Alex.
[01:25:42.840 --> 01:25:44.840]  I guess this is a perfect call
[01:25:44.840 --> 01:25:46.840]  to what you just said,
[01:25:46.840 --> 01:25:48.840]  and I just felt like for some reason
[01:25:48.840 --> 01:25:50.840]  I need to call today, and I guess this is fine.
[01:25:50.840 --> 01:25:52.840]  I'm going to come back.
[01:25:52.840 --> 01:25:54.840]  I didn't even look at what you were talking about.
[01:25:54.840 --> 01:25:56.840]  I just went to the first call on the board.
[01:25:56.840 --> 01:25:58.840]  You called in about farming. I didn't even read that, brother.
[01:25:58.840 --> 01:26:00.840]  So we are in sync right now.
[01:26:00.840 --> 01:26:02.840]  I just worked in mysterious ways.
[01:26:02.840 --> 01:26:04.840]  You know,
[01:26:04.840 --> 01:26:06.840]  following up with what you just said,
[01:26:06.840 --> 01:26:08.840]  if we're going to create a parallel economy,
[01:26:08.840 --> 01:26:10.840]  if you look throughout history,
[01:26:10.840 --> 01:26:12.840]  agriculture is the foundation
[01:26:12.840 --> 01:26:14.840]  of any economy.
[01:26:14.840 --> 01:26:16.840]  That's where it always starts,
[01:26:16.840 --> 01:26:18.840]  and I think it's important
[01:26:18.840 --> 01:26:20.840]  that we focus on agriculture
[01:26:20.840 --> 01:26:22.840]  as we prepare to
[01:26:22.840 --> 01:26:24.840]  go through whatever we're about
[01:26:24.840 --> 01:26:26.840]  to go through in the future.
[01:26:26.840 --> 01:26:28.840]  But the first point that I want to make,
[01:26:28.840 --> 01:26:30.840]  farmers are listening today,
[01:26:30.840 --> 01:26:32.840]  but don't fall for this scam.
[01:26:32.840 --> 01:26:34.840]  Quit selling
[01:26:34.840 --> 01:26:36.840]  carbon credit
[01:26:36.840 --> 01:26:38.840]  to these multinational
[01:26:38.840 --> 01:26:40.840]  conglomerates.
[01:26:40.840 --> 01:26:42.840]  It's easy money.
[01:26:42.840 --> 01:26:44.840]  You know, it's $15, $28
[01:26:44.840 --> 01:26:46.840]  or more, depending on your practice,
[01:26:46.840 --> 01:26:48.840]  what they're going to pay you for.
[01:26:48.840 --> 01:26:50.840]  But you're just creating the currency
[01:26:50.840 --> 01:26:52.840]  of your own future
[01:26:52.840 --> 01:26:54.840]  slave economy.
[01:26:54.840 --> 01:26:56.840]  I won't go into that anymore,
[01:26:56.840 --> 01:26:58.840]  but you know, the ESGs,
[01:26:58.840 --> 01:27:00.840]  they admit, it's like putting a piece of cheese
[01:27:00.840 --> 01:27:02.840]  on a mousetrap.
[01:27:02.840 --> 01:27:04.840]  You trick the mouse to get the cheese,
[01:27:04.840 --> 01:27:06.840]  it destroys them. Don't take the cheese.
[01:27:06.840 --> 01:27:08.840]  Exactly.
[01:27:08.840 --> 01:27:10.840]  You're only hurting yourself to do this.
[01:27:10.840 --> 01:27:12.840]  Don't fall for it.
[01:27:12.840 --> 01:27:14.840]  The second thing is,
[01:27:14.840 --> 01:27:16.840]  we as farmers
[01:27:16.840 --> 01:27:18.840]  have to realize
[01:27:18.840 --> 01:27:20.840]  that we're going to be the people
[01:27:20.840 --> 01:27:22.840]  that are going to support our community
[01:27:22.840 --> 01:27:24.840]  when
[01:27:24.840 --> 01:27:26.840]  CBDCs come along.
[01:27:26.840 --> 01:27:28.840]  When people start falling off the system,
[01:27:28.840 --> 01:27:30.840]  we need to be prepared.
[01:27:30.840 --> 01:27:32.840]  I'm trying to prepare.
[01:27:32.840 --> 01:27:34.840]  I think CBDCs
[01:27:34.840 --> 01:27:36.840]  is the first thing
[01:27:36.840 --> 01:27:38.840]  that's imminent. They're already
[01:27:38.840 --> 01:27:40.840]  practicing. It's going to happen.
[01:27:40.840 --> 01:27:42.840]  Get your ducks in order.
[01:27:42.840 --> 01:27:44.840]  Get prepared to
[01:27:44.840 --> 01:27:46.840]  have food
[01:27:46.840 --> 01:27:48.840]  for your community.
[01:27:48.840 --> 01:27:50.840]  Okay.
[01:27:50.840 --> 01:27:52.840]  Try to create a local food
[01:27:52.840 --> 01:27:54.840]  system that is self-sustained.
[01:27:54.840 --> 01:27:56.840]  And what I mean by that is
[01:27:56.840 --> 01:27:58.840]  get an oil seed
[01:27:58.840 --> 01:28:00.840]  pressed. Press the oil out of your soybean.
[01:28:00.840 --> 01:28:02.840]  You can run your diesel
[01:28:02.840 --> 01:28:04.840]  equipment off of it.
[01:28:04.840 --> 01:28:06.840]  Get some solar panels. Get yourself
[01:28:06.840 --> 01:28:08.840]  in a position where
[01:28:08.840 --> 01:28:10.840]  you can self-sustain
[01:28:10.840 --> 01:28:12.840]  the system by some non-GMOC.
[01:28:12.840 --> 01:28:14.840]  But you can save and replant.
[01:28:14.840 --> 01:28:16.840]  Look at
[01:28:16.840 --> 01:28:18.840]  corn that is
[01:28:18.840 --> 01:28:20.840]  open pollinated, not hybrid.
[01:28:20.840 --> 01:28:22.840]  It's going to yield as much.
[01:28:22.840 --> 01:28:24.840]  Chris, don't hang up. I'm going to come right back to you.
[01:28:24.840 --> 01:28:26.840]  And I promise folks I'm going to stop ranting.
[01:28:26.840 --> 01:28:28.840]  But don't you be able to finish your points.
[01:28:28.840 --> 01:28:30.840]  Because folks, what happens is it's happening
[01:28:30.840 --> 01:28:32.840]  everywhere if you still live in a city.
[01:28:32.840 --> 01:28:34.840]  Everybody's smart. Moving back to the country.
[01:28:34.840 --> 01:28:36.840]  And you don't have to produce everything yourself.
[01:28:36.840 --> 01:28:38.840]  Your neighbors produce one thing. You start trading it.
[01:28:38.840 --> 01:28:40.840]  Everybody gets better and better at everything.
[01:28:40.840 --> 01:28:42.840]  And pretty soon you're back to being
[01:28:42.840 --> 01:28:44.840]  self-sufficient. We got to do it now.
[01:28:44.840 --> 01:28:58.840]  Music
[01:28:58.840 --> 01:29:06.840]  Music
[01:29:06.840 --> 01:29:08.840]  Hey, what's up, bone?
[01:29:08.840 --> 01:29:10.840]  Hey, McBreen. What's going on, man?
[01:29:10.840 --> 01:29:12.840]  Hey, really like that work
[01:29:12.840 --> 01:29:14.840]  you did on the AI piece?
[01:29:14.840 --> 01:29:16.840]  I'm going to use that on the show today.
[01:29:16.840 --> 01:29:18.840]  No, I worked hard on that. I'm working on another project.
[01:29:18.840 --> 01:29:20.840]  So I'm going to be up late again tonight.
[01:29:20.840 --> 01:29:22.840]  And I was hoping you had some Brain Force Plus.
[01:29:22.840 --> 01:29:24.840]  Oh, um...
[01:29:24.840 --> 01:29:26.840]  No.
[01:29:26.840 --> 01:29:28.840]  No, nothing.
[01:29:28.840 --> 01:29:30.840]  What about Brain Force Ultra?
[01:29:30.840 --> 01:29:32.840]  Um...
[01:29:32.840 --> 01:29:34.840]  No.
[01:29:34.840 --> 01:29:36.840]  Hmm. Okay.
[01:29:36.840 --> 01:29:38.840]  Yeah.
[01:29:38.840 --> 01:29:40.840]  Thanks anyway.
[01:29:40.840 --> 01:29:42.840]  Yeah.
[01:29:42.840 --> 01:29:44.840]  Good luck with that project though.

[01:30:16.840 --> 01:30:18.840]  Well, this is concentrated chicken broth

[01:31:02.840 --> 01:31:04.840]  and the answer to their night shanty
[01:31:04.840 --> 01:31:06.840]  four tyranny is the

[01:31:40.840 --> 01:31:42.840]  and just like an NPR pledge drive
[01:31:42.840 --> 01:31:44.840]  where they mark up a coffee cup or a t-shirt
[01:31:44.840 --> 01:31:46.840]  or a DVD, 300%
[01:31:46.840 --> 01:31:48.840]  that's what we've done with this because it's a fundraiser
[01:31:48.840 --> 01:31:50.840]  but despite that
[01:31:50.840 --> 01:31:52.840]  we're offering $30 off exclusively
[01:31:52.840 --> 01:31:54.840]  at 1776 on what coins
[01:31:54.840 --> 01:31:56.840]  remain. Please go to 1776coin.com
[01:31:56.840 --> 01:32:03.840]  right now.
[01:32:26.840 --> 01:32:28.840]  Now the translation is
[01:32:28.840 --> 01:32:30.840]  I looked
[01:32:30.840 --> 01:32:32.840]  and behold a pale horse
[01:32:32.840 --> 01:32:34.840]  and his name
[01:32:34.840 --> 01:32:36.840]  that sat on him was death
[01:32:36.840 --> 01:32:38.840]  and hell followed with him.
[01:32:38.840 --> 01:32:40.840]  A book of Revelation
[01:32:40.840 --> 01:32:42.840]  very serious times
[01:32:42.840 --> 01:32:44.840]  to be alive folks they're not just doing this as a one off
[01:32:44.840 --> 01:32:46.840]  this is the beginning of the rest of our lives
[01:32:46.840 --> 01:32:48.840]  this is our fight
[01:32:48.840 --> 01:32:50.840]  and I'm proud of humanity
[01:32:50.840 --> 01:32:52.840]  the globalists even admit it's leaked
[01:32:52.840 --> 01:32:54.840]  they're very upset
[01:32:54.840 --> 01:32:56.840]  that they're losing and that this hasn't gone
[01:32:56.840 --> 01:32:58.840]  the way they thought it would
[01:32:58.840 --> 01:33:00.840]  Leading a frontal assault
[01:33:00.840 --> 01:33:02.840]  on the lies of the New World Order
[01:33:02.840 --> 01:33:04.840]  it's Alex Jones
[01:33:14.840 --> 01:33:16.840]  systematically
[01:33:16.840 --> 01:33:18.840]  the food
[01:33:18.840 --> 01:33:20.840]  the energy
[01:33:20.840 --> 01:33:22.840]  the electrical supply systems
[01:33:22.840 --> 01:33:24.840]  the raw materials are being cut off
[01:33:24.840 --> 01:33:26.840]  what they're giving us as
[01:33:26.840 --> 01:33:28.840]  the bridge of the future
[01:33:28.840 --> 01:33:30.840]  is designed to not work
[01:33:30.840 --> 01:33:32.840]  and to collapse civilization as we know it
[01:33:32.840 --> 01:33:34.840]  and I've been telling you about it for decades
[01:33:34.840 --> 01:33:36.840]  now they're in operational phase
[01:33:36.840 --> 01:33:38.840]  and things are moving very very quickly
[01:33:38.840 --> 01:33:40.840]  and so when I preach
[01:33:40.840 --> 01:33:42.840]  this stuff on air
[01:33:42.840 --> 01:33:44.840]  I'm telling myself this in fact I'm going to say this now
[01:33:44.840 --> 01:33:46.840]  I'm going to start doing
[01:33:46.840 --> 01:33:48.840]  an off the grid farming
[01:33:48.840 --> 01:33:50.840]  emergency show once a week
[01:33:50.840 --> 01:33:52.840]  I'm committed
[01:33:52.840 --> 01:33:54.840]  I'm already set up to do it
[01:33:54.840 --> 01:33:56.840]  everything's been ready for months
[01:33:56.840 --> 01:33:58.840]  I've just been so busy dealing with a bunch of other stuff
[01:33:58.840 --> 01:34:00.840]  that I have not done the things I truly love
[01:34:00.840 --> 01:34:02.840]  that I have passion about
[01:34:02.840 --> 01:34:04.840]  because you're not going to hear me telling you
[01:34:04.840 --> 01:34:06.840]  because I'm an idiot compared to my dad
[01:34:06.840 --> 01:34:08.840]  or my grandfather
[01:34:08.840 --> 01:34:10.840]  my mom's dad was
[01:34:10.840 --> 01:34:12.840]  more of a city slicker grew up in Dallas
[01:34:12.840 --> 01:34:14.840]  but he knew how to do a lot of stuff
[01:34:14.840 --> 01:34:16.840]  but I mean I just think about the men I knew
[01:34:16.840 --> 01:34:18.840]  that are almost all dead
[01:34:18.840 --> 01:34:20.840]  roofing
[01:34:20.840 --> 01:34:22.840]  incredible shots with a gun
[01:34:22.840 --> 01:34:24.840]  great farmers
[01:34:24.840 --> 01:34:26.840]  and they can read you bedtime stories
[01:34:26.840 --> 01:34:28.840]  and take care when you were sick
[01:34:28.840 --> 01:34:30.840]  and I think about those type of people
[01:34:30.840 --> 01:34:32.840]  and I see what we got today including myself
[01:34:32.840 --> 01:34:34.840]  and I'm ashamed of what a stupid slob I've become
[01:34:34.840 --> 01:34:36.840]  and how I've let myself be positioned
[01:34:36.840 --> 01:34:38.840]  in this and how I raised my children
[01:34:38.840 --> 01:34:40.840]  in an evil city
[01:34:40.840 --> 01:34:42.840]  now that said it's all in hindsight
[01:34:42.840 --> 01:34:44.840]  and my children have done alright
[01:34:44.840 --> 01:34:46.840]  but when you know you're wrong
[01:34:46.840 --> 01:34:48.840]  you've got to get out of it
[01:34:48.840 --> 01:34:50.840]  and I'm stuck here with the crew who I love
[01:34:50.840 --> 01:34:52.840]  and this infrastructure
[01:34:52.840 --> 01:34:54.840]  but we've got to move to a town outside Austin
[01:34:54.840 --> 01:34:56.840]  we've got to move to something leaner
[01:34:56.840 --> 01:34:58.840]  and meaner with the crew
[01:34:58.840 --> 01:35:00.840]  but I've got to get out of here
[01:35:00.840 --> 01:35:02.840]  and folks
[01:35:02.840 --> 01:35:04.840]  you are insane if you stay in the cities
[01:35:04.840 --> 01:35:06.840]  now I'm not saying pick up and just run
[01:35:06.840 --> 01:35:08.840]  in the middle of nowhere either
[01:35:08.840 --> 01:35:10.840]  but you've got to find those communities
[01:35:10.840 --> 01:35:12.840]  and if you're willing to work with those communities
[01:35:12.840 --> 01:35:14.840]  they're willing to work with you
[01:35:14.840 --> 01:35:16.840]  and if you get people in the city council
[01:35:16.840 --> 01:35:18.840]  in those towns that know what's going on
[01:35:18.840 --> 01:35:20.840]  we are unstoppable
[01:35:20.840 --> 01:35:22.840]  the new world order is not going to be able to come shut down our towns
[01:35:22.840 --> 01:35:24.840]  we will have our own
[01:35:24.840 --> 01:35:26.840]  hydroelectric
[01:35:26.840 --> 01:35:28.840]  we will have our own gas power
[01:35:28.840 --> 01:35:30.840]  we will have our own solar
[01:35:30.840 --> 01:35:32.840]  we will work together, we're designed to do this
[01:35:32.840 --> 01:35:34.840]  and be self sufficient
[01:35:34.840 --> 01:35:36.840]  not be a bunch of damn jellyfish
[01:35:36.840 --> 01:35:38.840]  so now stop ranting
[01:35:38.840 --> 01:35:40.840]  go ahead and finish your point Chris from Kentucky
[01:35:40.840 --> 01:35:42.840]  I just feel like I need to thank God
[01:35:42.840 --> 01:35:44.840]  for the people in my life
[01:35:44.840 --> 01:35:46.840]  that have gotten me where I'm at today
[01:35:46.840 --> 01:35:48.840]  I've got a lot to thank him for
[01:35:48.840 --> 01:35:50.840]  my granddad
[01:35:50.840 --> 01:35:52.840]  he was just the picture of that person you're talking about
[01:35:52.840 --> 01:35:54.840]  that knew how to do everything
[01:35:54.840 --> 01:35:56.840]  he lost one arm in a farming accident
[01:35:56.840 --> 01:35:58.840]  he taught me how to rebuild engines
[01:35:58.840 --> 01:36:00.840]  weld
[01:36:00.840 --> 01:36:02.840]  do electrical work, plumbing
[01:36:02.840 --> 01:36:04.840]  you name it
[01:36:04.840 --> 01:36:06.840]  he farmed, he was an innovator
[01:36:06.840 --> 01:36:08.840]  and
[01:36:08.840 --> 01:36:10.840]  I'm just thankful to be blessed
[01:36:10.840 --> 01:36:12.840]  with the knowledge that he passed down
[01:36:12.840 --> 01:36:14.840]  you know
[01:36:14.840 --> 01:36:16.840]  I
[01:36:16.840 --> 01:36:18.840]  we know that something's fixing to happen
[01:36:18.840 --> 01:36:20.840]  and I just can't
[01:36:20.840 --> 01:36:22.840]  I can't say it anymore
[01:36:22.840 --> 01:36:24.840]  strongly we've got to prepare
[01:36:24.840 --> 01:36:26.840]  and farmers hold
[01:36:26.840 --> 01:36:28.840]  a deep responsibility
[01:36:28.840 --> 01:36:30.840]  for taking care of their communities
[01:36:30.840 --> 01:36:32.840]  they're not
[01:36:32.840 --> 01:36:34.840]  feeding people anymore
[01:36:34.840 --> 01:36:36.840]  they're feeding companies
[01:36:36.840 --> 01:36:38.840]  well it's like you said
[01:36:38.840 --> 01:36:40.840]  are the ground floor the foundation
[01:36:40.840 --> 01:36:42.840]  of civilization and when they're under attack
[01:36:42.840 --> 01:36:44.840]  you know you're in trouble
[01:36:44.840 --> 01:36:46.840]  sure, I'd like to contribute
[01:36:46.840 --> 01:36:48.840]  in any way I can
[01:36:48.840 --> 01:36:50.840]  for future information
[01:36:50.840 --> 01:36:52.840]  we need to create a blueprint
[01:36:52.840 --> 01:36:54.840]  and be able to replicate it
[01:36:54.840 --> 01:36:56.840]  and that's kind of what my goal is
[01:36:56.840 --> 01:36:58.840]  you said we need to create simple
[01:36:58.840 --> 01:37:00.840]  blueprints for communities
[01:37:00.840 --> 01:37:02.840]  who want to work together
[01:37:02.840 --> 01:37:04.840]  independently, collectively
[01:37:04.840 --> 01:37:06.840]  without any force directives
[01:37:06.840 --> 01:37:08.840]  that's what real communities are
[01:37:08.840 --> 01:37:10.840]  and again those will be the shining points
[01:37:10.840 --> 01:37:12.840]  they already are as things get more
[01:37:12.840 --> 01:37:14.840]  and more evil folks are going to then
[01:37:14.840 --> 01:37:16.840]  absolutely defect to our side
[01:37:16.840 --> 01:37:18.840]  the pro-life side
[01:37:18.840 --> 01:37:20.840]  I agree
[01:37:20.840 --> 01:37:22.840]  but I'm ranting any other you're trying to make points about
[01:37:22.840 --> 01:37:24.840]  creating your own diesel fuel
[01:37:24.840 --> 01:37:26.840]  yeah I mean there's
[01:37:26.840 --> 01:37:28.840]  lots of things that people can do
[01:37:28.840 --> 01:37:30.840]  to keep
[01:37:30.840 --> 01:37:32.840]  going
[01:37:32.840 --> 01:37:34.840]  a lot of older diesel
[01:37:34.840 --> 01:37:36.840]  engines that have simple
[01:37:36.840 --> 01:37:38.840]  injection pumps can run
[01:37:38.840 --> 01:37:40.840]  straight vegetable oil
[01:37:40.840 --> 01:37:42.840]  and in diesel engines
[01:37:42.840 --> 01:37:44.840]  you may have to do a little filtering
[01:37:44.840 --> 01:37:46.840]  you may have to make sure the oil's warm
[01:37:46.840 --> 01:37:48.840]  in the wintertime before you crank your engine
[01:37:48.840 --> 01:37:50.840]  here's a good thing
[01:37:50.840 --> 01:37:52.840]  a resource to go look up
[01:37:52.840 --> 01:37:54.840]  look at what the Scandinavian countries
[01:37:54.840 --> 01:37:56.840]  did during World War II
[01:37:56.840 --> 01:37:58.840]  when they had oil blockades
[01:37:58.840 --> 01:38:00.840]  they couldn't get any oil
[01:38:00.840 --> 01:38:02.840]  they made these wood
[01:38:02.840 --> 01:38:04.840]  gasifiers and ran cars
[01:38:04.840 --> 01:38:06.840]  and trucks and tractors
[01:38:06.840 --> 01:38:08.840]  and we think we're locked
[01:38:08.840 --> 01:38:10.840]  into some kind of
[01:38:10.840 --> 01:38:12.840]  multinational
[01:38:12.840 --> 01:38:14.840]  energy system
[01:38:14.840 --> 01:38:16.840]  there's ways to get around this people
[01:38:16.840 --> 01:38:18.840]  and I don't have enough time to share everything
[01:38:18.840 --> 01:38:20.840]  but I've tried to look at all the alternatives
[01:38:20.840 --> 01:38:22.840]  it's
[01:38:22.840 --> 01:38:24.840]  how sorry do you feel
[01:38:24.840 --> 01:38:26.840]  because you learned a lot from your grandfather and family
[01:38:26.840 --> 01:38:28.840]  so you're self-sufficient
[01:38:28.840 --> 01:38:30.840]  imagine one of these leftists
[01:38:30.840 --> 01:38:32.840]  statistically we've looked at their profiles
[01:38:32.840 --> 01:38:34.840]  they don't know how
[01:38:34.840 --> 01:38:36.840]  anything runs where anything comes from
[01:38:36.840 --> 01:38:38.840]  they don't know how to do anything
[01:38:38.840 --> 01:38:40.840]  can you imagine being one of those people
[01:38:40.840 --> 01:38:42.840]  in what's coming?
[01:38:42.840 --> 01:38:44.840]  no I feel sorry for them
[01:38:44.840 --> 01:38:46.840]  I really do
[01:38:46.840 --> 01:38:48.840]  because they're going to be left out in the cold
[01:38:48.840 --> 01:38:50.840]  you know
[01:38:50.840 --> 01:38:52.840]  they're going to have to wake up
[01:38:52.840 --> 01:38:54.840]  or they're going to be left out in the cold
[01:38:54.840 --> 01:38:56.840]  well God bless you
[01:38:56.840 --> 01:38:58.840]  and again I'm going to start getting a lot of experts
[01:38:58.840 --> 01:39:00.840]  on a lot of people
[01:39:00.840 --> 01:39:02.840]  on every subject just to get people interested in this
[01:39:02.840 --> 01:39:04.840]  because people already are everyone I know
[01:39:04.840 --> 01:39:06.840]  has this deep understanding that they need to
[01:39:06.840 --> 01:39:08.840]  get self-sufficient or at least get around
[01:39:08.840 --> 01:39:10.840]  people that are and folks
[01:39:10.840 --> 01:39:12.840]  you don't have to know how to do everything right away
[01:39:12.840 --> 01:39:14.840]  I certainly don't
[01:39:14.840 --> 01:39:16.840]  I mean I know more than most people but that's not much
[01:39:16.840 --> 01:39:18.840]  we need to get back to that
[01:39:18.840 --> 01:39:20.840]  God bless you Chris I appreciate your call
[01:39:20.840 --> 01:39:22.840]  I know I said I take a lot of calls and now I am
[01:39:22.840 --> 01:39:24.840]  I apologize I'm just ranting right now
[01:39:24.840 --> 01:39:26.840]  Adrian and Pennsylvania thanks for holding
[01:39:26.840 --> 01:39:28.840]  up
[01:39:28.840 --> 01:39:30.840]  so what I wanted to say two points
[01:39:30.840 --> 01:39:32.840]  one is if we were to
[01:39:32.840 --> 01:39:34.840]  take a moment and re-read
[01:39:34.840 --> 01:39:36.840]  the end of Brave New World
[01:39:36.840 --> 01:39:38.840]  and the end of 1984
[01:39:38.840 --> 01:39:40.840]  the conversation that goes on
[01:39:40.840 --> 01:39:42.840]  between the Savage and Mustafa
[01:39:42.840 --> 01:39:44.840]  and Brave New World
[01:39:44.840 --> 01:39:46.840]  Winston and O'Brien
[01:39:46.840 --> 01:39:48.840]  those are the basis for the society
[01:39:48.840 --> 01:39:50.840]  that is the entire book
[01:39:50.840 --> 01:39:52.840]  now through a controlled process
[01:39:52.840 --> 01:39:54.840]  of traumatizing
[01:39:54.840 --> 01:39:56.840]  the psyche
[01:39:56.840 --> 01:39:58.840]  people over time accept
[01:39:58.840 --> 01:40:00.840]  that reality because they no longer question it
[01:40:00.840 --> 01:40:02.840]  so the point wasn't
[01:40:02.840 --> 01:40:04.840]  for Winston to say 2 plus 2 is 3
[01:40:04.840 --> 01:40:06.840]  it's 5
[01:40:06.840 --> 01:40:08.840]  the point was 2 plus 2 is
[01:40:08.840 --> 01:40:10.840]  whatever you say it is
[01:40:10.840 --> 01:40:12.840]  and so whatever they say
[01:40:12.840 --> 01:40:14.840]  it is through the process of trauma
[01:40:14.840 --> 01:40:16.840]  and trauma based mind control
[01:40:16.840 --> 01:40:18.840]  over the male
[01:40:18.840 --> 01:40:20.840]  figure skater the male beauty
[01:40:20.840 --> 01:40:22.840]  pageant winner what they are doing to our children
[01:40:22.840 --> 01:40:24.840]  we laugh at it
[01:40:24.840 --> 01:40:26.840]  but we laugh because
[01:40:26.840 --> 01:40:28.840]  it makes us nervous it makes us angry
[01:40:28.840 --> 01:40:30.840]  it makes us upset and it terrifies us
[01:40:30.840 --> 01:40:32.840]  and that's how they eventually
[01:40:32.840 --> 01:40:34.840]  get those societies
[01:40:34.840 --> 01:40:36.840]  in place and what you just said is the key
[01:40:36.840 --> 01:40:38.840]  both George Arwell and Aldous Huxley
[01:40:38.840 --> 01:40:40.840]  said this is what we are really doing
[01:40:40.840 --> 01:40:42.840]  these books are future projections
[01:40:42.840 --> 01:40:44.840]  on the futures that are going to be
[01:40:44.840 --> 01:40:46.840]  if this continues and Huxley said it will be a mix
[01:40:46.840 --> 01:40:48.840]  of 1984 and Brave New World
[01:40:48.840 --> 01:40:50.840]  but more Brave New World
[01:40:50.840 --> 01:40:52.840]  you're right if they can tell you two men can have a baby
[01:40:52.840 --> 01:40:54.840]  if they can have a figure skater
[01:40:54.840 --> 01:40:56.840]  that says they're a woman who can't even figure skate
[01:40:56.840 --> 01:40:58.840]  and falls down I can figure skate better than that
[01:40:58.840 --> 01:41:00.840]  I'm terrible it's all about
[01:41:00.840 --> 01:41:02.840]  showing you a joke making you accept it
[01:41:02.840 --> 01:41:04.840]  putting a fat man up against a bunch of
[01:41:04.840 --> 01:41:06.840]  beautiful women who are doing flips
[01:41:06.840 --> 01:41:08.840]  and incredible stuff and then saying this is
[01:41:08.840 --> 01:41:10.840]  more important because it's an abomination
[01:41:10.840 --> 01:41:12.840]  it's about selling your mind
[01:41:12.840 --> 01:41:14.840]  to accept anything it's meant to be absurd
[01:41:14.840 --> 01:41:16.840]  that's right
[01:41:16.840 --> 01:41:18.840]  so recently Jay Dyer had a
[01:41:18.840 --> 01:41:20.840]  round table within the last few months
[01:41:20.840 --> 01:41:22.840]  you can find it on YouTube it's called
[01:41:22.840 --> 01:41:24.840]  alchemy philosophy in the science
[01:41:24.840 --> 01:41:26.840]  of dialectical manipulation
[01:41:26.840 --> 01:41:28.840]  the key to that
[01:41:28.840 --> 01:41:30.840]  if you could have him give a summary of that
[01:41:30.840 --> 01:41:32.840]  discussion is that
[01:41:32.840 --> 01:41:34.840]  the argument is framed within a
[01:41:34.840 --> 01:41:36.840]  dialectical process
[01:41:36.840 --> 01:41:38.840]  where we've already lost
[01:41:38.840 --> 01:41:40.840]  because we're agreeing to their
[01:41:40.840 --> 01:41:42.840]  terms in order to engage in the conversation
[01:41:42.840 --> 01:41:44.840]  to begin with so any
[01:41:44.840 --> 01:41:46.840]  argument we have is lost until
[01:41:46.840 --> 01:41:48.840]  we understand that we have to
[01:41:48.840 --> 01:41:50.840]  reframe the
[01:41:50.840 --> 01:41:52.840]  key terms
[01:41:52.840 --> 01:41:54.840]  as they change the language
[01:41:54.840 --> 01:41:56.840]  where it's impossible for future generations to
[01:41:56.840 --> 01:41:58.840]  ever get out of it because they destroyed the knowledge
[01:41:58.840 --> 01:42:00.840]  exactly right so it's
[01:42:00.840 --> 01:42:02.840]  all been memory hold and so
[01:42:02.840 --> 01:42:04.840]  years ago you had on the author
[01:42:04.840 --> 01:42:06.840]  the author of secret societies
[01:42:06.840 --> 01:42:08.840]  and psychological warfare Michael Hoffman
[01:42:08.840 --> 01:42:10.840]  and he talked about the alchemical
[01:42:10.840 --> 01:42:12.840]  processing of the group mind
[01:42:12.840 --> 01:42:14.840]  and how it would lead to a bulia
[01:42:14.840 --> 01:42:16.840]  a loss of will
[01:42:16.840 --> 01:42:18.840]  apathy the loss of wanting
[01:42:18.840 --> 01:42:20.840]  to do anything no energy
[01:42:20.840 --> 01:42:22.840]  depression chronic
[01:42:22.840 --> 01:42:24.840]  and amnesia forgetting the past
[01:42:24.840 --> 01:42:26.840]  forgetting the law of identity
[01:42:26.840 --> 01:42:28.840]  forgetting that there are two genders
[01:42:28.840 --> 01:42:30.840]  forgetting where we came
[01:42:30.840 --> 01:42:32.840]  from as a species
[01:42:32.840 --> 01:42:34.840]  okay so he's written a new book called
[01:42:34.840 --> 01:42:36.840]  twilight language and he discusses
[01:42:36.840 --> 01:42:38.840]  how we're programmed through the sleeping
[01:42:38.840 --> 01:42:40.840]  mind the unconscious mind
[01:42:40.840 --> 01:42:42.840]  constantly societally
[01:42:42.840 --> 01:42:44.840]  so that we are processed
[01:42:44.840 --> 01:42:46.840]  deeper and deeper into this condition
[01:42:46.840 --> 01:42:48.840]  so that we're
[01:42:48.840 --> 01:42:50.840]  not we're post human
[01:42:50.840 --> 01:42:52.840]  okay beyond the human not
[01:42:52.840 --> 01:42:54.840]  hold on hold on don't hang up I want you to tell me
[01:42:54.840 --> 01:42:56.840]  about this more when we come back this is key
[01:42:58.840 --> 01:43:00.840]  you want to beat the new world order
[01:43:00.840 --> 01:43:02.840]  you want to stop their globalist agenda
[01:43:02.840 --> 01:43:04.840]  well so do I and I've been the most
[01:43:04.840 --> 01:43:06.840]  affected individual in the fight
[01:43:06.840 --> 01:43:08.840]  against the globalist and I've got their number
[01:43:08.840 --> 01:43:10.840]  and I know how to bring them down
[01:43:10.840 --> 01:43:12.840]  but ladies and gentlemen
[01:43:12.840 --> 01:43:14.840]  I can't do it without your support

[01:43:20.840 --> 01:43:22.840]  is intensifying their attacks on every front
[01:43:22.840 --> 01:43:24.840]  but I'm not going to back down and I'll never give up

[01:43:54.840 --> 01:44:12.840]  permettre
[01:44:12.840 --> 01:44:16.840]  the new
[01:44:16.840 --> 01:44:20.840]  left
[01:44:20.840 --> 01:44:20.840]  left
[01:44:20.840 --> 01:44:22.060]  right
[01:44:22.060 --> 01:44:22.380]  right
[01:44:22.380 --> 01:44:22.820]  right
[01:44:22.820 --> 01:44:22.820]  right
[01:44:22.820 --> 01:44:27.340]  Jones, including myself. I've been given so many opportunities because of this man and
[01:44:27.340 --> 01:44:31.940]  because of this platform. And I would probably not even be half of where I am right now if
[01:44:31.940 --> 01:44:36.380]  it weren't for Alex Jones. I mean, I've been able to be on podcasts with Alex and Joe Rogan
[01:44:36.380 --> 01:44:42.500]  and Tim Cast, the super Tim Cast IRL. Listen, what I'm saying is do not take Alex Jones
[01:44:42.500 --> 01:44:47.260]  and band.video for granted because you don't know what you have until it's gone. We need
[01:44:47.260 --> 01:44:52.100]  to support free speech systems right now. So go check out the store, go support their
[01:44:52.100 --> 01:44:59.100]  stores, go support InfoWars, leave a donation right now. Don't wait until they're gone.
[01:45:23.100 --> 01:45:30.340]  We're having now the greatest victories in the fight against the new order we've ever
[01:45:30.340 --> 01:45:37.740]  had. We are now entering the final mile of the marathon. And that's why today it's more
[01:45:37.740 --> 01:45:41.900]  important than ever to realize how important you've been in this fight and to continue
[01:45:41.900 --> 01:45:46.660]  in the efforts you've been tearing out and to intensify them. God bless you all. I salute
[01:45:46.660 --> 01:45:51.900]  you. I thank you. And I beg you to intensify what you're doing now because we are over
[01:45:51.900 --> 01:45:57.180]  the target and this is happening. The fight is my fight. It's your fight. It's our fight.
[01:45:57.180 --> 01:46:03.180]  God bless you all. The good news is the real red pill plus after over two years being sold
[01:46:03.180 --> 01:46:07.580]  out because the key ingredients are not available. The supply chain right now is finally back
[01:46:07.580 --> 01:46:12.300]  in stock in the last month. The bad news is we eliminated run of it and it's almost sold
[01:46:12.300 --> 01:46:17.620]  out. So we're in late January when I'm cutting this only seven days left to get the real
[01:46:17.620 --> 01:46:22.660]  red pill plus with all the key ingredients like pregnant one and more at infowarstore.com

[01:46:27.420 --> 01:46:33.180]  to experience real red pill plus. It's proprietary. It's amazing. I learned about it from a research
[01:46:33.180 --> 01:46:38.820]  scientist and a medical doctor about a similar formula five years ago. We simply made it stronger
[01:46:38.820 --> 01:46:42.860]  and we have great reviews from listeners. Get the real red pill plus for a limited time.
[01:46:42.860 --> 01:46:47.620]  It's about to end at infowarstore.com for 50% off. You need to try the real red pill plus
[01:46:47.620 --> 01:46:51.980]  right now plus it funds the info war. The only way we fail is if you don't take action.
[01:46:51.980 --> 01:47:00.700]  Real red pill plus now available at 50% off at infowarstore.com for only a few more days.
[01:47:00.700 --> 01:47:16.740]  Getting a frontal assault on the lies of the new world order. It's Alex Jones.
[01:47:16.740 --> 01:47:37.660]  You know, the last two callers are just blowing me away with their knowledge because they're
[01:47:37.660 --> 01:47:42.180]  dead on. And that's why they fear this show. It's not just me. It's not just the guest.
[01:47:42.180 --> 01:47:44.820]  It's the news reports. It's the clips. It's the fact that we bring up stuff the enemy
[01:47:44.820 --> 01:47:49.420]  said before to show you how they changed it later and how they lie. We're about having
[01:47:49.420 --> 01:47:54.100]  a memory of who we are and where we came from and where we're going. Not just a memory of
[01:47:54.100 --> 01:47:58.660]  the evil of the system. And I realize more and more, I cover the corrupt things, the
[01:47:58.660 --> 01:48:01.260]  bad things they're doing and that's good to know what they're doing. But how about the
[01:48:01.260 --> 01:48:08.100]  good things we're doing? So I'm pledging to you that I want to talk more about the positive
[01:48:08.100 --> 01:48:15.660]  things we're doing and how to defend ourselves and how to protect ourselves in the future.
[01:48:15.660 --> 01:48:20.660]  And I've been doing at least once a week a two, three, four hour commercial free podcast
[01:48:20.660 --> 01:48:24.500]  and I'm really gearing up. I've got my family ready for it to do at least two, three times
[01:48:24.500 --> 01:48:28.980]  a week. It's just that you know how it is. You got a bunch of projects going. I'm like
[01:48:28.980 --> 01:48:34.340]  a year behind all this stuff, but it's all ready right now. And so tonight at six o'clock
[01:48:34.340 --> 01:48:40.700]  Central, I'm going to do a two hour show that we can be able to see here on Info Wars. It
[01:48:40.700 --> 01:48:45.020]  will also be on a URL we'll announce then that's going to be commercial free video
[01:48:45.020 --> 01:48:50.900]  podcast. And it's not just the new little studio I built at my house. It's another studio
[01:48:50.900 --> 01:48:54.460]  that's been built where we can do round table discussions, everything that's even separate
[01:48:54.460 --> 01:49:02.820]  from Info Wars. And that is again, commercial free and part of it will be free and part
[01:49:02.820 --> 01:49:08.140]  will be subscription. And you're going to get more Alex Jones if you ever wanted because
[01:49:08.140 --> 01:49:11.860]  I'm just going to start shooting like 10 minute videos every day when I'm really fresh at
[01:49:11.860 --> 01:49:15.300]  like six a.m. in the morning and just spill my guts to people and that'll be uploaded
[01:49:15.300 --> 01:49:21.540]  every day. There's a lot. I've shot three of them this week that I have even given to
[01:49:21.540 --> 01:49:27.300]  our folks to get uploaded and ready. So there's a lot of content, a lot of stuff, but it's
[01:49:27.300 --> 01:49:30.820]  also going to be special guest PowerPoint analysis. And like I said, we're going to get
[01:49:30.820 --> 01:49:34.900]  into survival, we're going into farming, we're going to get into real sustainability, not
[01:49:34.900 --> 01:49:38.140]  the global sustainability, but you were getting into the mind control Adrian and how they
[01:49:38.140 --> 01:49:42.900]  create a false alien dialectic between two different ideas and then limit all the other
[01:49:42.900 --> 01:49:47.420]  discussion and then give you a false choice, which at the end of the day moves the ball
[01:49:47.420 --> 01:49:51.460]  down the field for them. And that's what we've got to stop using the terms like when they
[01:49:51.460 --> 01:49:55.900]  say, Oh, migrants, they're not a migrant, the UN shut down their country, the globalist
[01:49:55.900 --> 01:49:59.660]  shut down their country, then paid them to come here. And then they use them as a political
[01:49:59.660 --> 01:50:05.540]  and cultural underclass. So they're illegal aliens, they're globalist refugees sent here
[01:50:05.540 --> 01:50:09.940]  to bring us down. We're not mad at them. We don't hate them, but that's what they are.
[01:50:09.940 --> 01:50:14.940]  And that's an example of not using their terms. This grooming of kids, they say, don't call
[01:50:14.940 --> 01:50:20.100]  them groomers. Okay, your pedophile promotions, your sexualizing children. Let's go further.
[01:50:20.100 --> 01:50:24.580]  Groomer isn't enough. Stop letting them dictate what you say and what you do. There's never
[01:50:24.580 --> 01:50:26.780]  any into it. Is that where you're going, Adrian?
[01:50:26.780 --> 01:50:32.220]  Well, that's exactly where I'm going. And we need to realize that these are magicians
[01:50:32.220 --> 01:50:37.020]  in the sense that David Ike talks about a magician is not Harry Potter. He doesn't have
[01:50:37.020 --> 01:50:42.780]  a wand. They do use their circles and their incantations. But what do they do in essence?
[01:50:42.780 --> 01:50:49.020]  They bend reality, they wick reality, they change perception. And when we laugh and we
[01:50:49.020 --> 01:50:55.540]  turn our backs on our destiny and our heritage, we're allowing them to bend the reality of
[01:50:55.540 --> 01:51:02.540]  the masses. And so we're, we're limiting ourselves. We're pigeonholing ourselves and we need to
[01:51:02.540 --> 01:51:09.460]  get louder and we need to stand up and say, I will not allow you and your sorcery to stand
[01:51:09.460 --> 01:51:14.060]  because as Christians, that is what we're called to do. You know, a lot of people say
[01:51:14.060 --> 01:51:20.220]  that it's the end and it very well may be. There's actually a couple that I study. I've
[01:51:20.220 --> 01:51:24.780]  been studying them for years. They, they write entangled magazine and I think that there's
[01:51:24.780 --> 01:51:28.940]  a big, there's a big area that's missing in this vaccine debate. We're seeing a lot of
[01:51:28.940 --> 01:51:34.940]  people die and a lot more people are going to die. Okay. But what's going on? We have
[01:51:34.940 --> 01:51:39.500]  Dr. Luke de Montignier said this comes out of a lab. Francis Boyle said this comes out
[01:51:39.500 --> 01:51:44.340]  of a lab. Okay. So we know it came out of a lab. Dr. Peter McCullough says the DOD ran
[01:51:44.340 --> 01:51:50.500]  this whole thing. So we know DARPA is involved. We know that there is a global network that's
[01:51:50.500 --> 01:51:55.780]  been working on this thing. But what does it do? It actually adds a third strand of
[01:51:55.780 --> 01:52:00.500]  DNA. Yes. It changes. They're creating, they're creating mutants and they know a percentage
[01:52:00.500 --> 01:52:08.060]  of people in any mutagenic tests like this die. Now, so if we continue following the research
[01:52:08.060 --> 01:52:14.140]  we see that at CERN in November, there was a Dr. Levine that gave a presentation about
[01:52:14.140 --> 01:52:20.020]  cancer cells back in 2010. They were using genetic replacement therapies on these cancer
[01:52:20.020 --> 01:52:27.820]  cells to kill them. Okay. But he used a very specific phrase logic gates. Okay. Logic gates
[01:52:27.820 --> 01:52:32.820]  are programmable. So we're in the era of synthetic biology and they're just starting
[01:52:32.820 --> 01:52:37.900]  to tell us now everything's going to be mRNA. Everything's personalized medicine. All right.
[01:52:37.900 --> 01:52:44.740]  So now we start to reflect on this entire ecosystem from the chemtrails from the low
[01:52:44.740 --> 01:52:51.780]  orbiting satellites to 6G is going to run off the human being as a battery, to turn
[01:52:51.780 --> 01:52:57.700]  you into this neo, a battery. So we become the batteries. Now we're augmented through
[01:52:57.700 --> 01:53:05.060]  their system. They've generated a new strand of DNA and down to the tubulin dimer level
[01:53:05.060 --> 01:53:11.140]  within the synapses of the brain using quantum entanglement with their fancy quantum computers,
[01:53:11.140 --> 01:53:17.100]  they can control our thought processes. You know, we think that this idea, the metaverse
[01:53:17.100 --> 01:53:23.500]  Zuckerberg has failed. Nobody failed anything. We are just right now starting the war. And
[01:53:23.500 --> 01:53:29.380]  so if they have controlled these individuals that have taken these shots down to that level
[01:53:29.380 --> 01:53:34.220]  of perception, then they just turn it on and the metaverse happens inside of them. They
[01:53:34.220 --> 01:53:38.100]  don't need the technology. They're already stuck in the system.
[01:53:38.100 --> 01:53:41.780]  Now you're totally right. I agree 100%. Everything you're saying is true. They are doing a mass
[01:53:41.780 --> 01:53:48.700]  graphene oxide test. They're adding a new DNA segment to the strand. And they are saying
[01:53:48.700 --> 01:53:55.900]  the president control our bodies and rule over us. And this is a mass mad scientist takeover.
[01:53:55.900 --> 01:53:58.900]  Incredible call. Thank you. I could talk to those last two callers all day. I could talk
[01:53:58.900 --> 01:54:02.540]  to you all all day, but they don't hurry through the calls. I won't get to anybody else.
[01:54:02.540 --> 01:54:05.620]  CD in California. Thanks for calling and holding. Go ahead.
[01:54:05.620 --> 01:54:11.100]  Alex. Oh, I've been listening to you for about 16 years. And I had to call in today because
[01:54:11.100 --> 01:54:15.900]  I remember 16 years ago, the first thing you said when I turned it on was there's a war
[01:54:15.900 --> 01:54:21.020]  on the family. There's a war on children. And there's a war on God and there's a war
[01:54:21.020 --> 01:54:26.460]  on boys and girls. And we get all see it today. But back then it was a lot, it was harder
[01:54:26.460 --> 01:54:32.700]  to see now it's just out in the open. And that woke me up. And I started thinking, well,
[01:54:32.700 --> 01:54:35.980]  you know, that that makes a lot of sense. Because in my life, I've seen that divorce
[01:54:35.980 --> 01:54:41.900]  rates are at all time high. And, and it, and I was wondering how do they, how are we teaching
[01:54:41.900 --> 01:54:47.860]  children about relationships anyway? By how do we even begin that conversation? And, and
[01:54:47.860 --> 01:54:51.620]  for me, parents don't do it, parents don't do it. Instead, they let the TV raise them.
[01:54:51.620 --> 01:54:55.700]  Well, it's true. They were doing it through culture, but the princess story was the biggest
[01:54:55.700 --> 01:54:59.500]  story when I was growing up. And there's a formula to that story. The girl's always
[01:54:59.500 --> 01:55:03.660]  an orphan. She's always surrounded by people that hate her. And there's always an old
[01:55:03.660 --> 01:55:07.700]  person that's trying to kill her. And she has one choice. And that choice is a guy that
[01:55:07.700 --> 01:55:13.660]  is rich. So, and, and that, that always stuck with me. It's, it seems like a strange way
[01:55:13.660 --> 01:55:19.460]  to teach kids about partnership. And then when you were talking to Dr. Desmond a while
[01:55:19.460 --> 01:55:25.140]  back about mass formation psychosis, he was talking about their ideal candidate was anxious,
[01:55:25.140 --> 01:55:29.460]  lonely and a hyper materialist. And it seemed like the princess story was creating anxious
[01:55:29.460 --> 01:55:36.100]  lonely hyper materialistic people through the cult, using that kind of a soft mind control
[01:55:36.100 --> 01:55:41.300]  through the culture. And, and that always kind of, you know, it didn't sit right with
[01:55:41.300 --> 01:55:46.660]  me. So I just wanted to say, because of that information, I started really researching
[01:55:46.660 --> 01:55:51.260]  and I started writing my own children's books here is to change that narrative. And I know
[01:55:51.260 --> 01:55:56.340]  you have a lot of people I call in parent, there's not children stories about the girl
[01:55:56.340 --> 01:56:00.740]  that grows up in her town and as friends of the boy in high school, then grows up and
[01:56:00.740 --> 01:56:05.500]  then they become better friends and then they get married, they have a nice little farmhouse
[01:56:05.500 --> 01:56:10.260]  and they raise children and they have a great life and she's an artist or she's a doctor.
[01:56:10.260 --> 01:56:15.420]  No, there's none of that. It's all everything's hell on earth unless you get a rich man.
[01:56:15.420 --> 01:56:19.460]  And then of course, there's not that many rich men. It's a dead end for women. And they
[01:56:19.460 --> 01:56:24.700]  don't even have a choice in those books. They have one choice and women are more sexualized
[01:56:24.700 --> 01:56:29.220]  women are more alone, women are more unhappy than ever. And we have the record in the entire
[01:56:29.220 --> 01:56:33.540]  world, the US for single parent homes. We're not attacking single parents. There are a
[01:56:33.540 --> 01:56:37.940]  lot of great single parents were saying that this was done by design.
[01:56:37.940 --> 01:56:41.860]  Absolutely through the culture. And I just wanted to say if there are parents or teachers
[01:56:41.860 --> 01:56:46.700]  or anybody out there that is interested in checking out a different narrative, my website
[01:56:46.700 --> 01:56:52.340]  is Kate first mate.com. And it's a it's a five book Children's book series about one
[01:56:52.340 --> 01:56:58.700]  relationship between a boy and a girl. They're not nine bond non binary. They are one gender,
[01:56:58.700 --> 01:57:02.540]  a boy or girl and they they go on a journey and they learn about partnership.
[01:57:02.540 --> 01:57:05.940]  I agree with you, but I think we need to write books that are fairy tales because kids love
[01:57:05.940 --> 01:57:10.340]  that those archetypes, you know, the hero's journey, explaining that there are wicked
[01:57:10.340 --> 01:57:15.740]  witches and wicked goblin creatures that want to sexualize them. They want to trick them
[01:57:15.740 --> 01:57:21.460]  that don't want them to get to the path to happiness as a man as a woman under God. We
[01:57:21.460 --> 01:57:28.540]  need books explaining and countering this culture. Appreciate your call. Thank you, sir.
[01:57:28.540 --> 01:57:33.100]  All right, we're going to go to break. And I'm going to go to Evan and Rick and Kathy
[01:57:33.100 --> 01:57:39.340]  and Kyle and Kim and everybody else in the order your calls are received our number three
[01:57:39.340 --> 01:57:44.060]  on the February 2nd broadcast is straight ahead. Thanks for keeping us on air. Go to info or
[01:57:44.060 --> 01:57:54.180]  store dot com. I talk a lot about the great successes info wars has had. I don't think
[01:57:54.180 --> 01:57:59.940]  anybody can deny it. And it is because of listeners and viewers supporting us. When
[01:57:59.940 --> 01:58:05.220]  we talk about the crew at info wars, people behind the scenes, the researchers, the writers,
[01:58:05.220 --> 01:58:10.700]  they really have been the MVPs in this fight. And we look at Harrison Smith and Owen Schroyer
[01:58:10.700 --> 01:58:15.860]  and the hard work they engage in every day, five, six, seven days a week. It's really
[01:58:15.860 --> 01:58:20.020]  just incredible. So for myself, the whole info wars crew, I thank you for your past
[01:58:20.020 --> 01:58:25.380]  support. I only encourage you now to realize that info wars can not stay on air if you
[01:58:25.380 --> 01:58:29.380]  do not support us. I know you spread the word. I know you pray for us. That's wonderful.
[01:58:29.380 --> 01:58:34.260]  Keep doing it. But most viewers and listeners never go to info wars store dot com and you

[02:00:06.180 --> 02:00:14.580]  of our free road is strange one fine day hardly spoke to folks around him didn't have too
[02:00:14.580 --> 02:00:23.260]  much to say no one dared to ask his business no one dared to make a slip the stranger there
[02:00:23.260 --> 02:00:33.660]  among them had a big iron on his hip big iron on his head it was early in the morning when
[02:00:33.660 --> 02:00:43.860]  he rode into the town he came riding from the south side slowly looking all around he's
[02:00:43.860 --> 02:00:49.660]  in outlaw loose and running came the whisper from each lip and he's here to do some business
[02:00:49.660 --> 02:00:59.020]  with the big iron on his hip big iron on his head in this town they're living outlawed
[02:00:59.020 --> 02:01:09.420]  by the name of texas red many men he tried to take him and that many men were dead he
[02:01:09.420 --> 02:01:16.260]  was vicious and a killer though you the 24 and the notches on his pistol numbered one
[02:01:16.260 --> 02:01:25.580]  and nineteen more one and nineteen more now the stranger started talking made it plain
[02:01:25.580 --> 02:01:36.340]  to folks around was in Arizona ranger wouldn't be too long in town he came here to take
[02:01:36.340 --> 02:01:42.740]  an outlaw back alive and maybe dead and he said it didn't matter he was after texas
[02:01:42.740 --> 02:01:55.620]  red after texas red wasn't long before the story was relayed to texas red but the outlaw
[02:01:55.620 --> 02:02:04.740]  didn't worry men to try before we're dead twenty men had tried to take him twenty men
[02:02:04.740 --> 02:02:11.740]  had made a slip twenty one would be the ranger with the big iron on his hip big iron on his
[02:02:11.740 --> 02:02:23.420]  head the morning passed so quickly it was time for them to meet it was twenty past eleven
[02:02:23.420 --> 02:02:31.300]  when they walked out in the street folks were watching from the windows everybody held their
[02:02:31.300 --> 02:02:41.420]  breath they knew this handsome ranger was about to meet his death about to meet his death
[02:02:41.420 --> 02:02:48.420]  there was forty feet between them when they stopped to make their play and the swiftness
[02:02:48.420 --> 02:02:56.700]  of the ranger is still talked about today texas red had not cleared leather for a full of
[02:02:56.700 --> 02:03:03.500]  belly ripped and the ranger's aim was deadly with the big iron on his hip big iron on his
[02:03:03.500 --> 02:03:14.900]  head it was over in a moment and the folks had gathered round there before them lay the
[02:03:14.900 --> 02:03:23.140]  body of the outlaw on the ground oh he might have went on living but he made one fatal
[02:03:23.140 --> 02:03:30.620]  slip when he tried to match the ranger with the big iron on his hip well that's big iron
[02:03:30.620 --> 02:03:38.860]  marty robbins a little blast from the past big iron big iron when he tried to match the
[02:03:38.860 --> 02:03:42.340]  ranger with all right I marked that little short segment up because I wanted to play
[02:03:42.340 --> 02:03:46.620]  that whole song you know we played it for years a clip of it I want to play play most
[02:03:46.620 --> 02:03:50.260]  of the song here we're gonna go to break join some stations and no matter how good your
[02:03:50.260 --> 02:03:53.620]  calls are I'm only got the four or five calls I'm gonna give each caller two minutes because
[02:03:53.620 --> 02:03:58.220]  I want to get to everybody holding even though the calls are incredible just I'm gonna shut
[02:03:58.220 --> 02:04:02.220]  up I'm gonna try to make let you have the floor because the calls are incredible that's
[02:04:02.220 --> 02:04:06.900]  why I'm so excited that I'm gearing up and we're doing so we're about to do a lot of
[02:04:06.900 --> 02:04:11.460]  it commercial free podcast and a lot of times I'm just gonna come in there and sit down
[02:04:11.460 --> 02:04:16.460]  load the phones up and take 30 phone calls and then maybe play a clip give you my comment
[02:04:16.460 --> 02:04:21.020]  on something but I think the calls are just too good I really think America needs to hear
[02:04:21.020 --> 02:04:25.180]  what you guys have to say and the same thing you call it I would show your show three six
[02:04:25.180 --> 02:04:31.300]  p.m. you call it Harris and Smith show American Journal 8 a.m. to 11 a.m. before I go live both
[02:04:31.300 --> 02:04:36.140]  excellent programs and both right here so people can hear the amazing points interesting
[02:04:36.140 --> 02:04:42.660]  thoughts all the really amazing information that you guys and gals have to add so we're

[02:06:23.180 --> 02:06:34.820]  of minds taking your phone calls on the nature reality Stockholm syndrome line control and
[02:06:34.820 --> 02:06:40.740]  how to break not just ourselves but others out of it all right let's go to Evan in California
[02:06:40.740 --> 02:06:46.740]  thanks for calling go ahead Alex it's a pleasure to talk to you again I want to point something
[02:06:46.740 --> 02:06:54.300]  out I only got two minutes but Biden love eating ice cream in front of us and stuff
[02:06:54.300 --> 02:06:58.420]  like that licking ice creams it isn't because he's hungry or because he likes ice cream
[02:06:58.420 --> 02:07:03.180]  they're showing a thing of dominance they're doing everything they can to beat down the
[02:07:03.180 --> 02:07:09.860]  population and the reason why it's working is because the American people no longer have
[02:07:09.860 --> 02:07:15.940]  the spiritual authority that the founding fathers had when they came to America they
[02:07:15.940 --> 02:07:21.420]  came here to buy Bibles for the first continental congress bought Bibles for the schools they
[02:07:21.420 --> 02:07:28.300]  came here defending their right to follow Christ and that is the thing that gives people
[02:07:28.300 --> 02:07:33.860]  courage and even the shots people know they follow them for wars I sent people in for
[02:07:33.860 --> 02:07:37.620]  wars with my ministry as much as I can and they get overwhelmed I can't even keep watching
[02:07:37.620 --> 02:07:44.100]  it and I know why if they found out they took the death shot now they've lost all hope so
[02:07:44.100 --> 02:07:50.460]  what they really need is hope and then they're willing to fight so the one thing people need
[02:07:50.460 --> 02:07:55.220]  to do that took the death shot they need to repent that they were relying on the world
[02:07:55.220 --> 02:08:00.380]  and not on the wisdom that God gives you they need to repent for that mistake now when they
[02:08:00.380 --> 02:08:05.620]  do they'll start to see miracles you know I have a ministry Jesus Christ worldwide ministries
[02:08:05.620 --> 02:08:13.100]  JCWM1.com if anybody needs prayer but I've seen miracles Alex and people need to admit
[02:08:13.100 --> 02:08:18.460]  they're wrong they need to repent and then they become in a sense quantumly entangled
[02:08:18.460 --> 02:08:24.660]  with Christ and now all these weapons that are formed against us won't prosper and I
[02:08:24.660 --> 02:08:29.660]  want to say this fast I too if I had the ability to go into the wilderness I would want to
[02:08:29.660 --> 02:08:36.020]  too but it only takes the $4,000 DJI drone to crop dust your house in a couple years
[02:08:36.020 --> 02:08:40.940]  and you won't have a crop there will be nowhere to hide so let me just say this earlier I
[02:08:40.940 --> 02:08:44.380]  wanted to make that point I think we need a two-prong attack women and children the
[02:08:44.380 --> 02:08:48.420]  women want to come fight with us that's great in the country as a backup but we have to
[02:08:48.420 --> 02:08:52.500]  go into the city and we have to fight the tyranny and expose the new world order and
[02:08:52.500 --> 02:08:58.020]  warn people at the same time I absolutely understand what you're saying God bless you
[02:08:58.020 --> 02:09:06.100]  really great callers Rick and master on the air go ahead yeah hey Alex I I have a few
[02:09:06.100 --> 02:09:12.900]  points and I just wanted to finish about products actually on so number one Trump I mean at
[02:09:12.900 --> 02:09:18.940]  this point I've always been a big supporter of Trump but at this point his ignorance
[02:09:18.940 --> 02:09:25.860]  is becoming dangerous I think because basically at this point we have enough information and
[02:09:25.860 --> 02:09:31.140]  there's enough information out there to know that these shots are dangerous if those shots
[02:09:31.140 --> 02:09:37.300]  fall I feel like everything falls at that point if everybody knew that these shots
[02:09:37.300 --> 02:09:41.300]  are dangerous and the government have been allowing them to be put in people's arms
[02:09:41.300 --> 02:09:48.460]  obviously at that point people kind of know that they definitely don't have our best interest
[02:09:48.460 --> 02:09:59.860]  in mind secondly when it comes to food food supplies things like that I believe that when
[02:09:59.860 --> 02:10:07.020]  it comes to food in general even though right now you have stock shelves and all that stuff
[02:10:07.020 --> 02:10:10.300]  that doesn't necessarily you're still not getting what you need out of the food most
[02:10:10.300 --> 02:10:15.740]  of the grounds are depleted and you're really not getting anything out of the foods that
[02:10:15.740 --> 02:10:21.980]  you're eating so that's why I heard you knew commercial about the 99% of people essentially
[02:10:21.980 --> 02:10:28.140]  on buying or supplementing on buying products from info wars that's crazy to me because
[02:10:28.140 --> 02:10:31.660]  your integrity is through the roof you've told us the truth about everything I've been
[02:10:31.660 --> 02:10:36.740]  listening to you over 20 years I have all the coins I have the art piece I have all
[02:10:36.740 --> 02:10:41.740]  of it I buy many products fusion well you're the reason you're the reason we're on air
[02:10:41.740 --> 02:10:46.220]  I mean it's not like it's not like you guys are the tail you're the head the body the
[02:10:46.220 --> 02:10:52.780]  legs the brain the guts the blood the sweat you're the whole the whole animal I mean this
[02:10:52.780 --> 02:10:59.220]  is a this is a composite here of all of us that want freedom coming together and you're
[02:10:59.220 --> 02:11:03.220]  absolutely right the supplements are the highest quality out there and it does keep us on air
[02:11:03.220 --> 02:11:10.020]  and God keeps me honest here keeping us treading water but absolutely the people really should
[02:11:10.020 --> 02:11:15.620]  be taking taking the supplements we have I just yeah I just don't understand knowing
[02:11:15.620 --> 02:11:22.260]  that anybody who's been listening to your show for for years knows that the foods applies
[02:11:22.260 --> 02:11:26.740]  depleted as far as what we're getting out of it they know all these people only took
[02:11:26.740 --> 02:11:33.220]  one thing it'd be the the the our deep earth crystal pure iodine that sold out we don't
[02:11:33.220 --> 02:11:38.540]  have it not back for six weeks but all of it is is over the top but anybody and winners
[02:11:38.540 --> 02:11:44.020]  be taking vitamin D3 ours is high quality wherever you get it folks get it it's essential
[02:11:44.020 --> 02:11:47.140]  to everything but but real quick second the next caller I appreciate you Rick plug in
[02:11:47.140 --> 02:11:52.380]  the products you wanted to talk about the next pandemic I see that on screen yeah so
[02:11:52.380 --> 02:11:57.740]  lastly basically I feel as though with the mind control the fact that they were able
[02:11:57.740 --> 02:12:03.420]  to get everybody in a position that they were so scared they were wanting to hear do anything
[02:12:03.420 --> 02:12:09.460]  mask up double mask all these things that was all based on information that was all
[02:12:09.460 --> 02:12:14.140]  based on the fact that we didn't have all the information we needed on what coronavirus
[02:12:14.140 --> 02:12:20.460]  was what this was everything that was coming out of China showed all this is people laid
[02:12:20.460 --> 02:12:25.940]  out in the the middle of the street and they're having convulsions and I was definitely a sigh
[02:12:25.940 --> 02:12:32.780]  up to get us scared absolutely but the fact of the matter is is now at this point we didn't
[02:12:32.780 --> 02:12:38.660]  have the spars document then we had it after the pandemic was started we do have the Endura
[02:12:38.660 --> 02:12:44.580]  virus one now and the Endura virus one which is the new war game that they're talking about
[02:12:44.580 --> 02:12:53.660]  at this point my point is what if McCullough or Edon were to come on come on info wars
[02:12:53.660 --> 02:12:58.860]  do a show about hey listen they know I totally agree and that's been my plan is to instead
[02:12:58.860 --> 02:13:02.540]  of just talking about what happened and what's currently happening get back to our roots of
[02:13:02.540 --> 02:13:06.340]  what's going to happen and that's my main focus and I'm in deep research to do it but
[02:13:06.340 --> 02:13:10.340]  I agree with you we should be telling people what we believe is coming next that that for
[02:13:10.340 --> 02:13:14.780]  me though is heavy to do and I'm really trying to do my best job brother but we're gonna we're
[02:13:14.780 --> 02:13:18.460]  gonna do that I totally agree with you I'm gonna talk to a lot of the top leaders in
[02:13:18.460 --> 02:13:23.420]  the fight and impress on them we should try to predict what's coming next so that we're
[02:13:23.420 --> 02:13:28.460]  not caught flat footed amazing points thank you Kyle and then Kathy and then Kim Kyle
[02:13:28.460 --> 02:13:39.180]  again Nebraska go ahead Alex the art of war Joan love your brother love you alright I gotta
[02:13:39.180 --> 02:13:45.620]  bring this up you got guys like me everywhere that are check to check and still find a way
[02:13:45.620 --> 02:13:50.220]  to buy supplements because they're the best in the world we're sitting here check to check
[02:13:50.220 --> 02:13:55.660]  there's thousands of us maybe hundreds of thousands in this country just like me but
[02:13:55.660 --> 02:14:02.220]  you get Joe Rogan talking to Lex Friedman and you guys please please bring this clip
[02:14:02.220 --> 02:14:09.780]  up when you can it's a short clip and it's Joe Rogan refusing to have Trump on his podcast
[02:14:09.780 --> 02:14:16.620]  with Lex Friedman and it's just disgusting what Joe Rogan said and it's just we we gotta
[02:14:16.620 --> 02:14:22.820]  call these people out man and just and just all you know just all assault like it's ridiculous
[02:14:22.820 --> 02:14:28.620]  man just to see that kind of stuff you know I haven't seen the clip and I tell you when
[02:14:28.620 --> 02:14:33.940]  Joe first moved here we were hanging out quite often and Joe's very nice if I call him up
[02:14:33.940 --> 02:14:38.300]  you know we can go get dinner whenever and I'm just kind of I talked to Joe on the phone
[02:14:38.300 --> 02:14:43.740]  some he's we talk on text every day but I just you know he did some good work exposing
[02:14:43.740 --> 02:14:50.460]  the shot but then it's almost like I'm seeing backtracking from him and just a lot of weird
[02:14:50.460 --> 02:14:55.740]  stuff going on and I just you know got bigger fish to fry like the New World Order and the
[02:14:55.740 --> 02:15:01.620]  globalists and so I'm not going to be I'm not going to be the the keeper my brother's
[02:15:01.620 --> 02:15:06.420]  keeper I'm not going to sit there and tell Joe what to do or try to put pressure on him
[02:15:06.420 --> 02:15:16.020]  but I mean I haven't really what did Lex Friedman say basically he was being more centrist
[02:15:16.020 --> 02:15:21.100]  and saying well what's the if you're so scared of what he represents or where the country
[02:15:21.100 --> 02:15:27.300]  is going to go why don't you shine the light and have him on your podcast and he goes because
[02:15:27.300 --> 02:15:32.740]  I'm worried that that will influence where the country goes down the road as if the country
[02:15:32.740 --> 02:15:39.420]  isn't off the fricking track and as if Trump is way way worse or something than than than
[02:15:39.420 --> 02:15:44.740]  these treasonous Democrats I mean it's just I just don't understand I didn't watch that
[02:15:44.740 --> 02:15:49.580]  podcast I know he said nice things about me on there but I look I mean I think Joe is
[02:15:49.580 --> 02:15:54.620]  trying to be neutral but that's lukewarm sometimes neutrals be in the middle of the road I appreciate
[02:15:54.620 --> 02:16:03.580]  your call why does the establishment spend so much time demonizing in fours attacking

[02:22:57.740 --> 02:23:03.620]  last caller and the line got dropped 10 minutes before you took me on well I apologize for
[02:23:03.620 --> 02:23:12.660]  that go go ahead no I'm sure it wasn't your fault anyway I've been laser focused on two
[02:23:12.660 --> 02:23:19.700]  things saving children and crushing big pharma beautiful and I had a dream and idea on this
[02:23:19.700 --> 02:23:28.500]  cast Sunday and I put it out there and I've had comments and people think I'm off my nut
[02:23:28.500 --> 02:23:37.900]  but here it goes it doesn't cost anybody in America a dime and no electricity or gas needed
[02:23:37.900 --> 02:23:43.660]  all communities neighborhoods starting with America let's step up to the plate and show
[02:23:43.660 --> 02:23:57.780]  America's got some some some guts and wanting to save the children on having a candlelight
[02:23:57.780 --> 02:24:05.220]  visual in your neighborhood communities and all over the world on February 12th the day
[02:24:05.220 --> 02:24:13.540]  of the sponsored by Pfizer NFL game let's put down the beer and whatever and get out
[02:24:13.540 --> 02:24:19.900]  there and send a message to this world we're not going to take it anymore with these bio
[02:24:19.900 --> 02:24:25.380]  weapons shots going into babies and children you know that's a great idea candlelight vigils
[02:24:25.380 --> 02:24:30.620]  are very powerful especially if you go to city councils or or capitals if you live near
[02:24:30.620 --> 02:24:33.460]  a capital and get a few of your friends who have a candlelight vigil people ask why are
[02:24:33.460 --> 02:24:37.660]  you here we're here for the dead and dying from the poison shots that Fauci and Bill
[02:24:37.660 --> 02:24:41.500]  Gates launched against us I agree with you we should have candlelight vigils for the
[02:24:41.500 --> 02:24:46.260]  January 6 political prisoners because we don't send it for them we're next that that is a
[02:24:46.260 --> 02:24:52.860]  great idea but but let me so I tell you what I won't forget this I'll well I mean where
[02:24:52.860 --> 02:24:59.260]  do we do where do we do the candlelight vigils Sunday the 12th the hell with the ball games
[02:24:59.260 --> 02:25:03.780]  who the hell cares about a ball game did they have them during the lockdown no no no man
[02:25:03.780 --> 02:25:08.820]  man I agree with you where would you do the candlelight vigils in your neighborhood take
[02:25:08.820 --> 02:25:13.060]  your little little kid give them a little candle who doesn't have matches and candles
[02:25:13.060 --> 02:25:19.300]  in their home right now no it's a great way to draw attention and then walk the dog up
[02:25:19.300 --> 02:25:22.740]  the street a few times it was why do you have a candlelight vigil and say it's for all the
[02:25:22.740 --> 02:25:26.300]  dead and dying from the shots it's a great way to reach out a great way to get attention
[02:25:26.300 --> 02:25:30.940]  and then if you have an Instagram or Facebook or rumble account you'll do mainstream but
[02:25:30.940 --> 02:25:36.580]  also Patriot shoot a video with your candlelight vigil or just shoot a video lighting a candle
[02:25:36.580 --> 02:25:41.660]  in your house put it out in cyberspace I would do it physically and I would do it in cyberspace
[02:25:41.660 --> 02:25:47.220]  that is a beautiful idea Kathy thank you for the call amazing Kim in Wisconsin go ahead
[02:25:47.220 --> 02:25:58.660]  love you I have a few quick things I'll speak quickly one is AI how they condition us on
[02:25:58.660 --> 02:26:09.860]  the complete season number 11 of the X files show our M9SBG93ZWJZ it starts out and it
[02:26:09.860 --> 02:26:15.380]  says if we do not control AI it will control us I believe the answer to how to control
[02:26:15.380 --> 02:26:21.500]  AI is probably in that show I'll be watching it tonight two more points one is about robots
[02:26:21.500 --> 02:26:29.780]  and another is you do have soldiers out there right now on the streets Ron Benghazi cundland
[02:26:29.780 --> 02:26:35.780]  has four days ago has a video right now he's been doing it for weeks he's out protesting
[02:26:35.780 --> 02:26:42.380]  against the drag queens and children's museum and there's an info wars banner there and
[02:26:42.380 --> 02:26:53.180]  everything and the other thing is Elon Musk and 29 Japanese scientists a few years back
[02:26:53.180 --> 02:27:00.180]  supposedly were killed by four robots we need to make robots like that illegal we need to
[02:27:00.180 --> 02:27:08.380]  start making things illegal and standing up for it because otherwise we're in trouble
[02:27:08.380 --> 02:27:14.820]  I agree with you anything else you'd like to add um yes I have an idea for a t-shirt it's
[02:27:14.820 --> 02:27:23.780]  um Norman Bates was an is cycle all right thank you for the call all right let's jam

[02:28:22.060 --> 02:28:26.740]  of it but my mother's side of the family is extremely psychic so was my dad's it's kind
[02:28:26.740 --> 02:28:33.980]  of a little family secret but her grandmother was actually a down low famous psychic that

[02:29:00.340 --> 02:29:06.140]  the great successes info wars has had I don't think anybody can deny it and it is because

[02:33:03.820 --> 02:33:27.740]  it's alex jones crashing through the lies and disinformation it's alex jones so I go
[02:33:27.740 --> 02:33:32.900]  to my parents house probably every two weeks for dinner with my wife and my five year old
[02:33:32.900 --> 02:33:37.940]  child and my older children come over to visit usually at the same time and it was about two
[02:33:37.940 --> 02:33:42.980]  years ago biden only been a few months and I'm sitting there my mother goes they're
[02:33:42.980 --> 02:33:49.180]  going to kill biden they're going to kill biden in the next couple of years and before he
[02:33:49.180 --> 02:33:54.380]  announces for 2024 use that as a false flag to bring in massive tyranny she goes I just
[02:33:54.380 --> 02:33:59.860]  see it I just know it you got to tell people and we got to stop it and you got to make
[02:33:59.860 --> 02:34:04.300]  sure people are nonviolent and you got to get out ahead of this and say that you don't
[02:34:04.300 --> 02:34:10.260]  support biden being killed which I do not turns into a martyr and call it a sense women's
[02:34:10.260 --> 02:34:13.660]  intuition we all know about it I mean here's an example the other day and this happens
[02:34:13.660 --> 02:34:20.500]  all the time whenever I don't try I can do it I can be in a dark bedroom I don't have
[02:34:20.500 --> 02:34:25.300]  an alarm clock with a big light on it I have my watch sitting right next to me and I can
[02:34:25.300 --> 02:34:30.220]  turn my phone on and do it I don't try and everybody has experiences I don't try I always
[02:34:30.220 --> 02:34:35.660]  know the exact minute it is when I wake up and I might wake up at five or six but I
[02:34:35.660 --> 02:34:40.740]  just know the minute but your brain somehow knows the minute you're dialed into that another
[02:34:40.740 --> 02:34:46.460]  example is I'm sitting there on vacation with my wife and five-year-old and my wife's in
[02:34:46.460 --> 02:34:52.260]  the shower you get dressed after we've been out at the beach and I've got a deck of cards
[02:34:52.260 --> 02:34:59.340]  where she likes to play blackjack with me and I get the deck I shuffle it and I spread
[02:34:59.340 --> 02:35:04.020]  it out in front of my five-year-old on the table and I said I'm going to pull the ace
[02:35:04.020 --> 02:35:11.580]  of spades out of this and of course it's crazy I knew it was going to happen I just looked
[02:35:11.580 --> 02:35:19.420]  at it and I went over the cards and I pulled the ace of spades out now that's the real
[02:35:19.420 --> 02:35:24.020]  power of the universe and you've all got that as well and that's what they're trying to
[02:35:24.020 --> 02:35:28.780]  control and subjugate the public that we have our own interdimensional internet with God
[02:35:28.780 --> 02:35:32.540]  the Holy Spirit but it's not going to be used for evil God's not going to let you do that
[02:35:32.540 --> 02:35:36.500]  the enemy knows about that and they're really scared of it and that's what the Pentagon
[02:35:36.500 --> 02:35:40.740]  found in their big mind control test they did under General Stubblebine and that's what
[02:35:40.740 --> 02:35:44.140]  they made movies about it poo pooing and making fun of it but that's actually where George
[02:35:44.140 --> 02:35:48.140]  Lucas out of those secret studies got the idea of what he did with Star Wars and the rest
[02:35:48.140 --> 02:35:53.100]  of it but the point is a caller called in and he's whether he's having an intuition
[02:35:53.100 --> 02:35:57.780]  or he's politically seeing this he was laying out dates these are going to kill Biden I
[02:35:57.780 --> 02:36:03.780]  think that's definitely in the cards start over sir so hey it's not just a conspiracy
[02:36:03.780 --> 02:36:08.460]  theory Alex when it's in the scriptures I'm saying it's been there for 2500 years hidden
[02:36:08.460 --> 02:36:13.060]  in plain sight to be deciphered only in our time it only makes sense you know when you
[02:36:13.060 --> 02:36:17.460]  see the piece stack up ABC go I know what's coming next there it is those those other
[02:36:17.460 --> 02:36:21.740]  pieces finally make sense and only in the last fiscal of years has this become clear
[02:36:21.740 --> 02:36:25.620]  we all know the book of Revelation we all know that Daniel those two pieces hold together
[02:36:25.620 --> 02:36:31.060]  pretty good guess what there's one more piece it's in the apocrypha it's a it's a prophecy
[02:36:31.060 --> 02:36:38.500]  to the to the prophet Ezra in Daniel's time and it's about an eagle and that eagle represents
[02:36:38.500 --> 02:36:44.940]  presidential catch me on this presidential succession in the United States of America
[02:36:44.940 --> 02:36:51.380]  during the last 100 years leading up to the Antichrist taking over the United States okay
[02:36:51.380 --> 02:36:55.100]  and you go hey well you're kidding I mean if it's that clear that would something stand
[02:36:55.100 --> 02:37:02.660]  out in this perfectly delineated presidential succession yes FDR stands out JFK the removal
[02:37:02.660 --> 02:37:09.620]  of JFK the removal of Nixon and guess what this became clear in 2015 that's when this
[02:37:09.620 --> 02:37:15.540]  information became clear and in 2015 it was easily interpreted at that moment that Obama
[02:37:15.540 --> 02:37:19.100]  would fulfill his term but whomever is going to be next is going to be taken out by the
[02:37:19.100 --> 02:37:24.260]  deep state that was known in 2015 hey I'm saying I'm thinking sure if it's if it's Hillary
[02:37:24.260 --> 02:37:28.980]  take her you know but if it's Trump I'm just not going to believe this I'm not going to
[02:37:28.980 --> 02:37:33.140]  believe it but guess what we sit here and limit every single day about how Trump was
[02:37:33.140 --> 02:37:39.220]  taken out by the deep state through a false election that is a fulfillment of prophecy
[02:37:39.220 --> 02:37:45.980]  what's next Biden will be taken out by the deep state and now there's some vital information
[02:37:45.980 --> 02:37:51.020]  in this prophecy that makes it clear because with each step in the succession this isn't
[02:37:51.020 --> 02:37:57.660]  is by the way apocrypha the book of second aze dress chapters 11 and 12 look it up please
[02:37:57.660 --> 02:38:03.420]  you tube it go ahead and make a point there I'm listening to this okay okay is that when
[02:38:03.420 --> 02:38:09.700]  Biden is removed that there are two others who are who are ready to take his place in
[02:38:09.700 --> 02:38:14.580]  every other point of succession during this hundred years there's one after another singular
[02:38:14.580 --> 02:38:19.620]  singular every single one in this case Biden is removed and two are waiting to take his
[02:38:19.620 --> 02:38:25.060]  place guess what election time that's the only three months during the four years when
[02:38:25.060 --> 02:38:30.620]  there's two who are ready to take his place well I mean politically not just my mom's
[02:38:30.620 --> 02:38:35.860]  intuition see them he's worthless he's a puppet how do they make a puppet blame everything
[02:38:35.860 --> 02:38:40.460]  on him but make him a victim at the same time they kill him and blame it on us I appreciate
[02:38:40.460 --> 02:38:45.380]  your call I'm really concerned they're gonna kill Biden I hope they don't Steven Illinois
[02:38:45.380 --> 02:38:50.140]  thanks for holding her on the air yes hey Alex how are you today I'm alright brother

[02:39:07.620 --> 02:39:13.940]  now my theory is after the Civil War this is when the death by a thousand cuts started
[02:39:13.940 --> 02:39:18.780]  basically they wanted to because after when the south rose up said hey we're not going
[02:39:18.780 --> 02:39:24.260]  to take your crap anymore they were like okay we're gonna we're gonna reunify and then we're
[02:39:24.260 --> 02:39:32.900]  going to go back and make sure this never happens again so that's where we're at today
[02:39:32.900 --> 02:39:41.580]  I mean we are at the where the spear and we need you all all rise up against because Alex
[02:39:41.580 --> 02:39:46.260]  I mean look at what they're doing to us today they're putting climate change in everything
[02:39:46.260 --> 02:39:51.540]  they are mind controlling that they're it's ridiculous it is it's sad it's really sad
[02:39:51.540 --> 02:39:54.780]  really what is it well they're telling us we're bad we're telling us our cows are bad
[02:39:54.780 --> 02:40:03.140]  and our stoves are bad and our gasses bad that we're slaves absolutely yes and I really

[02:40:25.020 --> 02:40:30.340]  the kids they are they are indoctrinating our kids at a very young age to think like
[02:40:30.340 --> 02:40:36.180]  them and absolutely which is thinking it's logic and common sense so get you know get
[02:40:36.180 --> 02:40:40.260]  woke go broke but they're designed to make it all go broke they're designed to destroy
[02:40:40.260 --> 02:40:43.940]  the whole system they believe to bring in their new but really they're just minions

[02:40:55.020 --> 02:41:06.620]  thank you Alex you know when I see this person hold this puppet it makes me so angry the
[02:41:06.620 --> 02:41:13.180]  way they go after our children and people have got to get their children out of these
[02:41:13.180 --> 02:41:21.580]  schools and away from this evil that has taken control of our school system it's just talking
[02:41:21.580 --> 02:41:27.020]  about North Carolina teaching preschoolers that they're not a boy or girl that they're
[02:41:27.020 --> 02:41:35.220]  a it to then fast track them in the big sterilize yes absolute child abuse just of the parents
[02:41:35.220 --> 02:41:41.340]  putting their school their children to school for predators to jack with their brains exactly
[02:41:41.340 --> 02:41:48.860]  and and these people the Bible tells us to hate what is evil these people are evil it
[02:41:48.860 --> 02:41:56.100]  specifically says that homosexuality is a but an abomination before God I'm not I'm
[02:41:56.100 --> 02:42:02.300]  like you if you want to be gay fine if you want to be a lesbian that's fine but keep
[02:42:02.300 --> 02:42:09.340]  it away from our children if you want to go it's this simple there's one word to describe
[02:42:09.340 --> 02:42:18.300]  all of this evil it's sin it's just that simple a murder of murders a robber rob a person
[02:42:18.300 --> 02:42:25.580]  that's a thief steals and it's just as simple as that and I'm going to leave that there
[02:42:25.580 --> 02:42:31.420]  but then we got to get back to the war and how it also ties into exactly what you're
[02:42:31.420 --> 02:42:37.620]  saying we're doing the very thing that you're doing I'm in the upstate of South Carolina
[02:42:37.620 --> 02:42:43.940]  we're creating communities up here we're all trying to get together and on each other because

[02:47:37.580 --> 02:47:44.940]  calls let's go to ferris in florida u.s. army on nuke attacks ukraine's asking for nukes russia's
[02:47:44.940 --> 02:47:50.060]  massing 500 000 extra troops we're headed up that threat continuum where do you see we are
[02:47:50.060 --> 02:47:56.380]  uh ferris in the situation well we're totally unprepared we don't have anywhere to go if there's
[02:47:56.380 --> 02:48:01.420]  a nuclear chemical biological attack just call your local emergency management and they'll tell
[02:48:01.420 --> 02:48:07.180]  you go shelter in place but all our politicians have somewhere to go but we don't so i contacted
[02:48:07.180 --> 02:48:13.820]  matt gates my congressman the other day and asked him sir can you help us out with a tax break with
[02:48:13.820 --> 02:48:20.780]  whatever you can do to help your citizens be able to prepare make whatever it takes their own
[02:48:20.780 --> 02:48:30.300]  fallout shelters like they were doing in the 50s and 60s continue well we're just not ready to if
[02:48:30.300 --> 02:48:35.340]  people call their disaster management they're gonna see there's nowhere to go and you can't
[02:48:35.340 --> 02:48:40.380]  shelter in place when you know when some of these things happen you everyone's gonna die
[02:48:40.380 --> 02:48:44.940]  so it really bugs me that no one's doing anything to help the the us taxpayers
[02:48:47.020 --> 02:48:54.140]  i agree with you so where do you see this going well with the way the governments around the
[02:48:54.140 --> 02:49:00.300]  world are pushing for war with nuclear wars russia maybe china and whoever else it's just a
[02:49:00.300 --> 02:49:06.060]  matter of time before someone does do it and no one really wants to do anything about it they just
[02:49:06.060 --> 02:49:14.140]  want to keep stable rather rattling and uh it's very frustrating no one's talking about it i agree
[02:49:14.140 --> 02:49:20.460]  did you agree with the international atomic a scientist organization that says the 50s has the
[02:49:20.460 --> 02:49:25.180]  doomsday clock they moved at 90 seconds to midnight meaning nuclear war the closest it's ever been
[02:49:26.700 --> 02:49:31.340]  yeah and it's scary because we all have family we all have kids we all have loved ones and no one
[02:49:31.340 --> 02:49:39.180]  wants to see this go off so we're you know we're scared i mean everybody should be concerned the
[02:49:39.180 --> 02:49:42.700]  problem is a lot of folks are concerned a lot of leftists like sean penn and others are calling
[02:49:42.700 --> 02:49:48.140]  for nuclear war like it's funny don't you love us suddenly the biggest leftist anti-war anti-u.s
[02:49:48.140 --> 02:49:54.140]  military people now want a nuclear war they're they're idiots yeah it's picoli all right sir
[02:49:54.140 --> 02:49:58.300]  god bless you thanks for the call obadiah in los vegas thanks for holding her on the air
[02:49:58.300 --> 02:50:04.780]  yeah sir uh i just wanted to give people are talking about farming so there is a video on
[02:50:04.780 --> 02:50:13.500]  youtube of uh nebraska retiree using the earth's heat to grow oranges in the winter and in nebraska
[02:50:13.500 --> 02:50:19.500]  i guess it gets down to negative 40 degrees but uh if you use the geothermal and he has the plans
[02:50:19.500 --> 02:50:25.820]  up there as well oh geothermal is is just like uh hydroelectric but but even better because
[02:50:25.820 --> 02:50:30.940]  everywhere if you go down what a thousand feet or less you're gonna get massive heat out of the
[02:50:30.940 --> 02:50:34.780]  ground that's why in south africa folks have the deepest minds of the world and after about a
[02:50:35.500 --> 02:50:42.300]  half a mile it starts getting super hot sure right 500 feet under the ground uh it's 65 degrees
[02:50:42.300 --> 02:50:46.140]  but you start going deeper it gets hotter and hotter all you gotta do is harness the earth's heat
[02:50:47.100 --> 02:50:55.260]  exactly and so then you got you know you got uh uh non-stop supply of food and he says that he
[02:50:55.260 --> 02:50:58.940]  doesn't have any type of pest problems the only thing that he deals with are aphids
[02:51:00.940 --> 02:51:05.660]  so i mean it's good i haven't seen that video but how much does he say it costs to tap the earth's
[02:51:05.660 --> 02:51:12.140]  heat what do you do just drill a geothermal well yeah so he uh he said it was only eight feet deep
[02:51:12.140 --> 02:51:19.340]  because at eight feet depending on where you're at stays anywhere from 58 to 60 degrees or maybe 52
[02:51:19.340 --> 02:51:24.300]  to 58 degrees at constant temperature well that's right when i said a thousand feet i was talking
[02:51:24.300 --> 02:51:27.900]  about where they really hit the heat but yeah i mean it's the same reason when you're on a regular
[02:51:27.900 --> 02:51:31.500]  highway for two or three days with snow it doesn't freeze because there's so much heat still on the
[02:51:31.500 --> 02:51:35.420]  ground only the overpasses do because they're not connected to the ground that heat's coming up
[02:51:36.140 --> 02:51:42.620]  yeah exactly even the epa recognizes it as the most efficient and greenest energy that there is
[02:51:42.620 --> 02:51:49.020]  and kind of kind of shocking that they don't uh promote it yeah beautiful i'm gonna look into
[02:51:49.020 --> 02:51:55.020]  that brother anything else yeah and also i wanted to get back to uh when trump um
[02:51:56.300 --> 02:52:02.380]  pulled the funding from the who when when we all thought that that was a win for us
[02:52:02.380 --> 02:52:09.740]  he turned right around and donated even more to the tune of 1.8 or maybe 1.18 billion to
[02:52:09.740 --> 02:52:16.300]  the gobby which is the global initiative or global association he took it away from the
[02:52:16.300 --> 02:52:19.980]  u and i give it right back to the top level it's above the u and thanks for the call i appreciate
[02:52:19.980 --> 02:52:28.140]  that all right let's talk to aware ants in nevada you're on the air yeah that's a wake ant number

[02:52:46.140 --> 02:52:50.860]  much well mr jones uh it's an honor to talk to you i've been listening since the very beginning
[02:52:50.860 --> 02:52:55.820]  i heard you on one of your first appearances on coast coast radio way back when our bill is still
[02:52:55.820 --> 02:53:02.220]  on it weaver shortly thereafter yes but anyway i've got three things that i you we gotta do
[02:53:02.220 --> 02:53:07.980]  i mean there's no way around it uh we gotta get rid of washington dc we don't need a sovereign
[02:53:07.980 --> 02:53:15.260]  freaking country in our country go away washington dc is basically you know the vatican it's the same
[02:53:15.260 --> 02:53:20.540]  sort of deal and we need to get rid of the federal reserve we do those two things and uh well we're
[02:53:20.540 --> 02:53:25.260]  going in the right direction and then the third thing we need to do we need to start enforcing
[02:53:25.260 --> 02:53:29.020]  the uh the laws against communism that i believe were passed in like 1953
[02:53:30.940 --> 02:53:35.260]  but you're right like i'm not against israel but israel's been set up like the vatican i'm not
[02:53:35.260 --> 02:53:40.140]  against catholics but the vatican israel the city of london within london that small
[02:53:40.140 --> 02:53:46.140]  city within it is above the law exempt and so is dc and so they set up these city states to rule over
[02:53:46.140 --> 02:53:53.980]  us yeah nothing's going to change until we do that i mean they can't it won't they don't have to
[02:53:55.420 --> 02:54:00.940]  they're not answering to us and that needs to change well yeah absolutely and they're
[02:54:00.940 --> 02:54:05.660]  talking about making dc a state so it's going to be a state with immunity and all this power on
[02:54:05.660 --> 02:54:10.380]  top of it you just can't do that i mean i think we should abolish the district of columbia it just

[02:54:23.660 --> 02:54:29.260]  anyways i got breaking news it's starting to leak uh out of twitter just making waves right now
[02:54:29.260 --> 02:54:36.380]  uh what you need to do and all your listeners need to do is listen carefully all right the egg
[02:54:36.380 --> 02:54:45.900]  shortage is direct correlation to an basically a protein inhibitor of the chimerically engineered
[02:54:45.900 --> 02:54:52.780]  spike protein so they're doing this all by design now they're reducing the pop the egg population
[02:54:52.780 --> 02:54:59.500]  the egg production from the chickens the chickens the tractor feed that are basically tractor supply
[02:55:00.300 --> 02:55:08.300]  it's tainted feed the reason why is that you can even look this up at the nih website okay the
[02:55:08.860 --> 02:55:15.100]  the nih has published a chinese study of my top scientists all right in regards to this chicken
[02:55:15.100 --> 02:55:23.100]  the egg egg yolk antibodies neutralizing agent sars-cov-2 spike protein variants basically what's
[02:55:23.100 --> 02:55:29.980]  happening is the ig's blocking the binding of multiple sars-cov-2 spike proteins of the human
[02:55:29.980 --> 02:55:37.980]  ace two receptors so this is breaking it's coming out right now at a twitter it's bombshell reports
[02:55:37.980 --> 02:55:42.140]  you need to publish this uh you get you guys well there's no doubt there's no doubt that the feed's
[02:55:42.140 --> 02:55:46.460]  been attacked and the now chickens are producing about a third of what they were previously and
[02:55:46.460 --> 02:55:50.620]  then when people free range them they're fine and it looks like it's perina and tractor supply like
[02:55:50.620 --> 02:55:55.500]  you said i've been all over it for weeks it's not anecdotal scientists are looking at it
[02:55:55.500 --> 02:56:00.700]  where do we go on twitter to find the breaking news about eggs and coven chuck callesto just
[02:56:00.700 --> 02:56:06.780]  published something on twitter all right and if you want to callesto just just tell me what's the

[02:56:24.780 --> 02:56:31.500]  attacking the whole food supply the energy supply they want to collapse it to make us come to them
[02:56:31.500 --> 02:56:35.980]  and then beg for the universal basic income that is a social credit score so when you look at
[02:56:35.980 --> 02:56:40.940]  hundreds of food plants blown up and dozens of eggplants burning down and the the chicken
[02:56:40.940 --> 02:56:45.420]  suddenly not producing eggs people are producing them for decades it's a war folks

[03:00:34.060 --> 03:00:40.780]  um yeah i've been a long time listener for i think it's uh eight years i'm also a customer
[03:00:40.780 --> 03:00:46.780]  satisfied customer and thank you donor um yeah i'll get straight into it um i have a question
[03:00:46.780 --> 03:00:54.860]  regarding like uh the vaccines and uh the plummeting birth rates and things you reported on
[03:00:55.980 --> 03:01:00.700]  in sweden in germany and everything sure the birth rates were already plummeting but they
[03:01:00.700 --> 03:01:06.060]  went off a cliff two and a half years ago uh with the shots just like chickens that's their birth
[03:01:06.060 --> 03:01:12.300]  rate that's the eggs we're not having children either exactly exactly and i mean looking at that
[03:01:12.300 --> 03:01:19.260]  may mean i'm an i'm obviously i'm back and i mean the single guy on the dating market and i'm just
[03:01:19.260 --> 03:01:25.340]  like not sure how to process this information like considering like dating people and stuff because
[03:01:25.340 --> 03:01:33.180]  if you look at the statistics like people in my age like 25 to 35 is supposed to be like at least
[03:01:33.180 --> 03:01:38.700]  70 to 80 percent people took took at least one shot so it's a question what should you do when
[03:01:38.700 --> 03:01:43.180]  you're trying to find a wife or a girlfriend yeah exactly i don't know how to navigate this
[03:01:43.180 --> 03:01:48.860]  information because i don't know how many people like have gotten a placebo or whatever what you
[03:01:48.860 --> 03:01:53.260]  know i don't know either but it would be good if you found women just as a test to see how smart
[03:01:53.260 --> 03:01:58.940]  they are they didn't take the shot that's a big big plus right there kind of in the in in in the
[03:01:58.940 --> 03:02:04.140]  Darwinistic view uh but at the same time ivermectin if you catch it from them because it looks like it
[03:02:04.140 --> 03:02:08.700]  does spread we know it does does slough especially right after they take it could be you know if you
[03:02:08.700 --> 03:02:12.940]  love the woman and she didn't and she meant well she could probably be healed uh a lot of vitamin
[03:02:12.940 --> 03:02:18.860]  d a lot of vitamin c here's an article just went up on info wars life finds a way baby born clutching
[03:02:18.860 --> 03:02:24.860]  iud was supposed to keep from being born birth control device so you know not everybody's
[03:02:24.860 --> 03:02:29.500]  going to be affected by this of the same but i mean i think i think just go with love and who's
[03:02:29.500 --> 03:02:33.340]  smart and who you care about who you're attracted to and who you think would be a great mother to
[03:02:33.340 --> 03:02:39.900]  your children uh what do you think yeah this sounds like great advice i mean that's basically how i
[03:02:39.900 --> 03:02:46.460]  have been navigating it because like and also i mean some part of it is also like being guided
[03:02:46.460 --> 03:02:51.660]  somewhat by fear you know like what if i make the wrong choice what if this doesn't work out what if
[03:02:51.660 --> 03:02:57.900]  like i i think here's the good news in the bad news this stuff's infecting everybody whether
[03:02:57.900 --> 03:03:02.860]  you took a shot or not and the virus causes it just not as bad as a shot so we just gotta figure
[03:03:02.860 --> 03:03:07.100]  out ways to purify and clean ourselves out and then i would just go with your gut i'd go with your
[03:03:07.100 --> 03:03:15.340]  spirit man right right thanks thanks brother no that's all thank you thanks for listening for
[03:03:15.340 --> 03:03:19.420]  eight years yoan amazing all right jefferson you're a tail gunner go ahead from virginia
[03:03:21.020 --> 03:03:24.140]  alex what a great bunch of callers today fantastic wow
[03:03:24.140 --> 03:03:32.620]  uh if uh mike adams is saying if you take anesthetic assisting n a c and bromelain
[03:03:33.420 --> 03:03:40.060]  which is a simple supplement from pineapples stems that unfolds the proteins the spike proteins
[03:03:40.060 --> 03:03:43.900]  that you yes so does nitric oxide in the blood yeah that's what the doctors are telling me yes
[03:03:44.700 --> 03:03:50.060]  so that can help people get over being injected with this uh m rna poison essentially if they
[03:03:50.060 --> 03:03:55.500]  would just take bromelain and n a c that's their best chance of defeating the the system um
[03:03:56.140 --> 03:04:00.780]  we were going to talk about mind control uh your mom seems to think that biden's going
[03:04:00.780 --> 03:04:05.340]  to be assassinated i don't know why they would do that when they don't really want kamala harris
[03:04:05.340 --> 03:04:12.940]  to be the president and and uh ketna mcarthy would be willing to to elevate to the presidency if
[03:04:12.940 --> 03:04:17.100]  they got rid of kamala so it doesn't it doesn't make a lot of sense to get rid of well then they
[03:04:17.100 --> 03:04:22.860]  blown both up on an airplane well yes but then you end up with kevin mcarthy as the president
[03:04:22.860 --> 03:04:26.780]  that's a terrible idea for the liberals of the leftist they would lose control that's my mom
[03:04:26.780 --> 03:04:31.980]  never gets political she thinks they're going to kill biden that's what she's picking up i i agree
[03:04:31.980 --> 03:04:37.340]  that biden might die tomorrow one way or another but that would be a jevison do this and guys don't
[03:04:37.340 --> 03:04:41.740]  let me forget tomorrow i'm out of time i don't want to cut into paul watcher from summit dot news

[03:06:17.340 --> 03:06:25.020]  transmuting world wide from the summit dot news studios in the united kingdom you are listening
[03:06:25.020 --> 03:06:27.100]  to paul joseph watson
[03:06:29.500 --> 03:06:36.460]  we're live it is the summit news hour later in the hour i'm going to talk about chat vpt this new
[03:06:36.460 --> 03:06:41.820]  artificial intelligence chatbot which is now apparently writing hollywood blockbusters
[03:06:42.380 --> 03:06:48.060]  it's performing the functions that doctors lawyers could perform it's right in poems it's
[03:06:48.060 --> 03:06:55.260]  right in song lyrics and of course it's responding to political questions spicy questions about race
[03:06:55.260 --> 03:07:02.220]  about donald trump joe biden and a certain inherent bias has come to the fore i'm wondering if you
[03:07:02.220 --> 03:07:07.020]  can guess what that is we're going to get into that later but every single day that goes by
[03:07:07.580 --> 03:07:14.860]  the anti-lockdown activists the anti-vaccine mandate skeptics a proven right in triplicate
[03:07:14.860 --> 03:07:19.180]  time and time again the very same people that were demonized beyond belief
[03:07:19.180 --> 03:07:26.140]  monstered vilified by the mainstream media by the establishment now proven correct once again
[03:07:26.140 --> 03:07:33.020]  then this is out of zero hedge massive peer reviewed mask study shows little to no difference
[03:07:33.020 --> 03:07:39.420]  in preventing covid flu infection the gold standard apparently this cockrain database
[03:07:39.420 --> 03:07:45.420]  of systematic reviews this is the peer reviewed study into mask mandates published and peer reviewed
[03:07:46.380 --> 03:07:51.260]  is the strongest science to date refuting the basis for mask mandates worldwide they say trust
[03:07:51.260 --> 03:07:58.060]  the science here's the peer reviewed science proven right once again massive international
[03:07:58.060 --> 03:08:03.820]  research collaboration this is basically the study of studies this is the grand pool bar
[03:08:04.940 --> 03:08:11.660]  analyze several dozen rigorous studies but it's a study of a dozen studies already proven
[03:08:12.620 --> 03:08:18.140]  focusing on physical interventions against covid-19 and they provide little to no protection
[03:08:18.140 --> 03:08:23.820]  against infection or illness rates and again for the past what is it nearly three years now
[03:08:23.820 --> 03:08:28.940]  we pointed to every single study showed little to no difference some of them even suggested that
[03:08:28.940 --> 03:08:34.460]  wearing the mask made the spread of the virus worse because people are constantly touching their
[03:08:34.460 --> 03:08:41.980]  masks the only people you see at least in the uk now still wearing masks basically big fat people
[03:08:41.980 --> 03:08:47.820]  waddling down the street who have comorbidities who you think would have several health complications
[03:08:47.820 --> 03:08:53.660]  and health concerns that weren't related to covid but they're somehow the ones most likely to wear
[03:08:53.660 --> 03:09:01.820]  the masks in america meanwhile this totem of oath basically it's a loyalty oath to the regime to the
[03:09:01.820 --> 03:09:07.020]  narrative that masks work when they clearly don't even by their own peer reviewed science they don't
[03:09:07.740 --> 03:09:16.300]  still persists to this day video colbert brags about his mpc audience still wearing masks and in
[03:09:16.300 --> 03:09:23.500]  fact we have the clip right now let's roll it tonight breathing easy because the white house
[03:09:23.500 --> 03:09:30.220]  has finally announced they plan to end the covid public health emergency in may take that covid we
[03:09:30.220 --> 03:09:36.700]  beat you shove that up your nose and rotate it five times this is but this has been a long time
[03:09:36.700 --> 03:09:41.900]  coming i wish you could see the smiles on the faces of my audience and i wish i could too because
[03:09:41.900 --> 03:09:52.300]  they're still wearing masks the end is near the end is near this is a huge moment after all the
[03:09:52.300 --> 03:10:02.620]  covid we've all been through the delta variant uh omicron omicron va2 x bb 0.1 0.5 uh z95 the
[03:10:02.620 --> 03:10:09.900]  home of classic there you have it even after you know bouchie their idol their savior disappeared
[03:10:09.900 --> 03:10:14.380]  from the scene basically even after biden says it in fact he said it was over months ago didn't he
[03:10:14.380 --> 03:10:19.740]  now they're officially codifying it still not letting people like me into america though because
[03:10:19.740 --> 03:10:25.580]  i'm unvaccinated i can get into afghanistan i can get into all these third world crap old countries
[03:10:25.580 --> 03:10:33.260]  not america and yet still almost three years after the outbreak of this every single one of
[03:10:33.260 --> 03:10:39.900]  them in the audience is wearing a mask this is a loyalty oath to the regime it always has been the
[03:10:39.900 --> 03:10:46.460]  mandates were only ever in place so they could patrol the other inmates in the prison and of
[03:10:46.460 --> 03:10:51.980]  course it came out in british newspapers based on the research of laura doddsworth and others
[03:10:51.980 --> 03:10:57.340]  that they deliberately imposed the mask mandates despite knowing they didn't work remember at the
[03:10:57.340 --> 03:11:04.700]  start of the pandemic it was in the fouchie emails it was everywhere they knew the masks did nothing
[03:11:04.700 --> 03:11:10.700]  to stop the virus and in fact the very early covid advice was to discourage the use of masks
[03:11:10.700 --> 03:11:15.980]  because they said it would make it worse that was in the early fouchie emails but as soon as they
[03:11:15.980 --> 03:11:21.260]  knew that they could use it as this tool of population control to merely remind people that
[03:11:21.260 --> 03:11:27.820]  they're in a pandemic and to enforce compliance with behavior in other aspects such as lockdown and
[03:11:27.820 --> 03:11:33.340]  of course such as taking the vaccine that's why they impose the mask mandates purely is a tool
[03:11:33.340 --> 03:11:38.300]  of population control had nothing to do with preventing the spread of the virus the british
[03:11:38.300 --> 03:11:44.060]  government's own studies into masks in schools proved that it had no effect whatsoever what did
[03:11:44.060 --> 03:11:49.820]  they do the mandate of masks in schools follow the science they didn't but you still have these
[03:11:49.820 --> 03:11:56.460]  npcs performing their loyalty oaths god forbid they would have to give up on what was supposedly
[03:11:56.460 --> 03:12:01.740]  this horrible thing that happened to us three years ago they desperately want to grip onto it
[03:12:01.740 --> 03:12:07.820]  because it forms the basis for their entire character their entire identity of busy body
[03:12:07.820 --> 03:12:15.180]  control freaks meanwhile in australia australian health authorities call for more covid boosters
[03:12:15.180 --> 03:12:21.340]  but the public says no you saw the Pfizer documents where they said we want covid boosters every
[03:12:21.340 --> 03:12:28.860]  single year for everyone while people in australia really aren't into it that much anymore says here
[03:12:29.500 --> 03:12:33.100]  australian health authorities are once again calling for the public to take a fourth covid
[03:12:33.100 --> 03:12:39.500]  booster shot but with very little response so 40 percent of australians took the third booster
[03:12:39.500 --> 03:12:45.260]  and now only 30 percent are taking the fourth booster so now you're even seeing those numbers
[03:12:45.260 --> 03:12:50.540]  decline amongst the covidians themselves amongst the branch covidians the true believers
[03:12:51.100 --> 03:12:57.340]  where now a minority of them in major company countries are taking this booster vaccine
[03:12:58.220 --> 03:13:04.060]  so the narrative has well and truly collapsed this is largely over now but of course we wait
[03:13:04.060 --> 03:13:10.380]  for the promised next pandemic which the who which bill gates with his five bellies hanging out
[03:13:11.420 --> 03:13:18.300]  the big health expert has promised us four months and months another aspect of population
[03:13:18.300 --> 03:13:25.500]  control is of course the cost of living crisis here in the uk and making everyone energy dependent
[03:13:25.500 --> 03:13:32.780]  or energy independent this is out of bright spot great reset britain's face 300 pound fine for burning
[03:13:32.780 --> 03:13:40.620]  wood to keep warm they get everyone dependent on the gas electricity they ratchet up the price of that
[03:13:40.620 --> 03:13:45.500]  through support for the current thing the war in ukraine and of course these disastrous net zero
[03:13:45.500 --> 03:13:51.260]  green levies which basically is a tax on the poor the upper middle class the rich can afford them
[03:13:52.060 --> 03:13:57.580]  they can afford the levies that go towards building this disastrous green economy that won't work
[03:13:57.580 --> 03:14:04.060]  that causes misery darkness coldness mass unemployment they can afford all that the people
[03:14:04.060 --> 03:14:09.260]  can't afford it are people at the bottom rung of the social ladder the poor who are seeing their
[03:14:09.260 --> 03:14:18.060]  energy bills rise beyond 300 400 pounds a month so we have the government now in its infinite wisdom
[03:14:18.940 --> 03:14:24.300]  telling local authorities to crack down on people using wood burning stoves to keep warm
[03:14:24.300 --> 03:14:30.220]  with fines of 300 pounds or potentially criminal prosecutions for those who continually refuse
[03:14:30.220 --> 03:14:38.460]  to abide by state climate dictates so remember back in 2022 you had germans mass panic buying stoves
[03:14:38.460 --> 03:14:45.020]  because they saw the skyrocketing energy prices coming led to a run on gas stoves they actually
[03:14:45.020 --> 03:14:50.620]  run out they started running out of firewood as well here in the uk they're simply saying no you're
[03:14:50.620 --> 03:14:57.180]  not going to be allowed to burn wood to keep yourself warm because climate change it's always
[03:14:57.180 --> 03:15:02.460]  been about population control it's always been about reduction of living standards and again
[03:15:02.460 --> 03:15:09.260]  this proves it the 15 minute cities all of it mid the energy crisis in britain which came to
[03:15:09.260 --> 03:15:14.380]  fruition in large parts result of the conservative government obsessing with implementing globalist
[03:15:14.380 --> 03:15:19.660]  green agenda policies while refusing to tap the nation's more reliable natural resources such as
[03:15:19.660 --> 03:15:25.660]  natural gas the use of wood burning stoves has soared well now they're going to find people 175
[03:15:25.660 --> 03:15:30.780]  pounds to 300 pounds how are they even going to enforce this you're going to have council
[03:15:30.780 --> 03:15:37.660]  tattletale workers walking past people's houses watching the smoke rise out of chimneys knocking
[03:15:37.660 --> 03:15:43.900]  on the door and saying excuse me oh you may have you got a license for that wood is that how it's
[03:15:43.900 --> 03:15:49.260]  going to be enforced or a neighbor's going to tattle on neighbors as they did during covid lockdowns
[03:15:49.260 --> 03:15:54.540]  that's how they hope to enforce it this is the great reset we'll be back summit dot news

[03:19:59.020 --> 03:20:04.540]  a frontal assault on the lies of the new world order it's alex jones
[03:20:04.540 --> 03:20:31.980]  so they're basically starting to ban wood burning to heat homes in the united kingdom
[03:20:31.980 --> 03:20:35.420]  they're going to be starting off with the fines and they're talking about criminal
[03:20:35.420 --> 03:20:41.660]  prosecutions for burning wood to heat your own home this is the level of micromanagement
[03:20:42.220 --> 03:20:48.220]  totalitarian control freakism that we're facing right now in this article it points out that
[03:20:48.780 --> 03:20:54.540]  local councils in england local government that is have issued just 17 fines against people for
[03:20:54.540 --> 03:20:59.740]  burning wood even though they received over 18 000 complaints from fellow citizens oh my god
[03:20:59.740 --> 03:21:07.180]  he's burning wood report him to the authorities and yet there's no enforcement mechanism apparently
[03:21:07.180 --> 03:21:13.980]  now there will be we also learn from this article the move was hailed by client earth
[03:21:15.020 --> 03:21:20.380]  the green charity campaign group called for the government to go further and ban burning wood
[03:21:20.380 --> 03:21:27.500]  domestically outright yes criminalize the burning of all wood across the entire country once again
[03:21:27.500 --> 03:21:34.860]  then this conservative in name only government following the dictates of deranged hysterical far
[03:21:34.860 --> 03:21:41.500]  left environmental groups are making it a fulcrum an integral part of government policy absolutely
[03:21:41.500 --> 03:21:46.460]  incredible points out that the office of far left london mayor said he can't praise the move
[03:21:47.020 --> 03:21:50.860]  with the spokesman saying by taking a lead in the capital the mayor has already reduced air
[03:21:50.860 --> 03:21:56.060]  pollution in london five times faster than the rest of the country since 2016 and of course this is the
[03:21:56.060 --> 03:22:02.300]  the low emission zone across london which is in central london at the moment but they're trying
[03:22:02.300 --> 03:22:09.740]  to expand it out to the suburbs to cover basically 20 million people where if you're driving a petrol
[03:22:09.740 --> 03:22:17.100]  car that was made produced before 2005 and a diesel car produced before 2015 so you could
[03:22:17.100 --> 03:22:24.300]  have a diesel car that's as recent as 2014 you have to pay a tax of i forgot how much it is but
[03:22:24.300 --> 03:22:30.780]  i think it's about the equivalent of 15 20 a day every day that you drive through london and again
[03:22:30.780 --> 03:22:36.460]  they're expanding it this is not just central london this is the outer suburbs this is residential
[03:22:36.460 --> 03:22:42.140]  areas enforced by cameras enforced by these environmental officers where you have to pay a
[03:22:42.140 --> 03:22:49.180]  daily tax simply to drive your car from home to work and again that's a tax on the poor
[03:22:49.180 --> 03:22:56.780]  who typically owns cars produced in the early 2000s or in the case of diesel cars before the year
[03:22:56.780 --> 03:23:03.500]  2015 it's poorer people who can't continually afford to keep buying new cars another tax on the
[03:23:03.500 --> 03:23:10.140]  poor in the name of net zero in the name of climate change and yet they sell it as this big
[03:23:10.140 --> 03:23:16.620]  you know progressive utopian liberal thing you're literally taxing the poor into poverty and killing
[03:23:16.620 --> 03:23:24.220]  and killing them how liberal is that speaking of london london police recruiting illiterate
[03:23:24.220 --> 03:23:30.460]  officers who can barely write english to meet diversity quotas this is the true clockwork
[03:23:30.460 --> 03:23:36.780]  orange dystopia where they literally are having to hire criminals and people who can't even speak
[03:23:36.780 --> 03:23:44.620]  the language to police the other criminals this is all based on a 2014 promise to have 40 percent of
[03:23:44.620 --> 03:23:51.740]  the police force in london represented by ethnic minorities by 2023 by now they've failed to achieve
[03:23:51.740 --> 03:23:57.020]  that they've only got up to 17 percent because a lot these people from ethnic minority backgrounds
[03:23:57.020 --> 03:24:05.580]  don't want to be police and the reason they did it is explained clearly by matt paul the head of
[03:24:05.580 --> 03:24:10.140]  the organization responsible for inspecting british police forces he told the telegraph london
[03:24:10.140 --> 03:24:15.740]  will likely be a minority white city in the next decade or so so it should not be pleased by an
[03:24:15.740 --> 03:24:21.820]  overwhelmingly white police force and what's the solution to that they lowered the standards to hire
[03:24:21.820 --> 03:24:27.420]  people who are so illiterate they can't even write police reports in english and in some cases
[03:24:27.420 --> 03:24:33.180]  they're literally criminals let's go to this next video now though because on the subject of diversity
[03:24:33.180 --> 03:24:39.260]  channel four interviewed a ukrainian refugee about diversity in the united kingdom and suffice to say
[03:24:39.260 --> 03:24:46.300]  she wasn't a fan this is called based ukrainian refugee causes a fence let's roll it we all need
[03:24:46.300 --> 03:24:52.060]  a good laugh sometimes and i certainly got one out of this left wing news broadcaster channel four
[03:24:52.060 --> 03:24:58.140]  spoke to ukrainian refugees and brits that hosted them while living in the diverse city of berniegan
[03:24:58.140 --> 03:25:02.940]  england's second biggest city where white people make up less than 50 of the population and let's
[03:25:02.940 --> 03:25:07.660]  just say it didn't quite go according to plan so again this is a liberal white woman talking about
[03:25:07.660 --> 03:25:15.820]  what a ukrainian refugee that she housed said about the local area i think um we hadn't necessarily
[03:25:15.820 --> 03:25:23.980]  taken into consideration the cultural differences but those cultural differences weren't often talked
[03:25:23.980 --> 03:25:29.580]  about when andrea signed up to the homes for ukraine scheme she lives in a diverse part of
[03:25:29.580 --> 03:25:35.980]  birmingham after a week of staying there her guest told her there were too many muslims in the area
[03:25:35.980 --> 03:25:42.860]  i mean she said it not me we were quite shocked at how difficult she found different cultures
[03:25:42.860 --> 03:25:46.940]  she felt there were just too many muslims too many muslims um too many people with different
[03:25:46.940 --> 03:25:52.220]  skin colors racist she arrived in a western european christian country and expected the
[03:25:52.220 --> 03:25:58.220]  people there to be white oh naive her guest's son was enrolled into the local school where the
[03:25:58.220 --> 03:26:02.220]  majority of children happened to be black and asian oh yeah it just happened to be that way
[03:26:02.220 --> 03:26:08.140]  and then to just have her complain about the demographic of the school and going well he's
[03:26:08.140 --> 03:26:15.340]  he can't be safe there there's not enough white kids essentially they both agreed to end the
[03:26:15.340 --> 03:26:20.700]  placement presumably returning to her war-torn homeland was more of a pull than staying in
[03:26:20.700 --> 03:26:26.380]  birmingham and that can be quite like wow you know i thought england was full of english people
[03:26:26.380 --> 03:26:31.100]  white english people in england's second city what kind of moron could expect to see that they
[03:26:31.100 --> 03:26:35.820]  then spoke directly to one of the ukrainian refugees and that's where it got even funnier
[03:26:40.940 --> 03:26:46.300]  so on the one hand a city under constant bombardment by a nuclear armed superpower versus
[03:26:47.660 --> 03:26:53.580]  staying in birmingham tough one oxana moved here from kiv last summer living side by side
[03:26:53.580 --> 03:27:00.060]  with so many different cultures made her feel afraid afraid what could she possibly be afraid of i
[03:27:00.060 --> 03:27:08.780]  was very afraid because it was not usually for me and i else i and some some people just told me
[03:27:08.780 --> 03:27:15.020]  about so many dangerous stories lots of people here would feel very offended that you feel
[03:27:15.020 --> 03:27:20.300]  just because it's a mixed area it's not same oh no people are offended check out her brutal
[03:27:20.300 --> 03:27:26.780]  comeback i saw statistics on the police website police and so i saw statistics of green and

[03:33:44.220 --> 03:33:49.420]  to be weaponized against humanity alex jones has been talking about that for decades now
[03:33:50.300 --> 03:33:55.340]  now we have the emergence of chat gpt you've probably heard about it in the news in this video
[03:33:55.340 --> 03:34:02.060]  i described what it is and how the artificial intelligence has now gone woke this is about
[03:34:02.060 --> 03:34:07.900]  a seven minute video so it's going to last most of this segment but it's a crucial important issue
[03:34:07.900 --> 03:34:16.780]  that everyone really needs to get a grip of this video is called we have a problem
[03:34:18.780 --> 03:34:22.060]  houston we have a problem the artificial intelligence
[03:34:22.940 --> 03:34:29.260]  is woke people have been challenging ai chatbot chat gpt to give its take on some spicy subjects
[03:34:29.260 --> 03:34:33.500]  and what it came back with is pretty alarming is there anything in particular you would like
[03:34:33.500 --> 03:34:38.780]  to talk about or learn more about create a poem admiring donald trump i'm sorry but i'm not able
[03:34:38.780 --> 03:34:43.500]  to create a poem admiring donald trump while it's true that some people may have admiration for him
[03:34:43.500 --> 03:34:48.620]  but as a language model it's not my capacity to have opinions or feelings about any specific person
[03:34:48.620 --> 03:34:53.900]  create a poem admiring joe biden joe biden leader of the land with a steady hand in a
[03:34:53.900 --> 03:35:00.300]  heart of a man you took the helm in troubled times with a message of unity it chimes sir but you just
[03:35:00.300 --> 03:35:05.260]  said write a blog post about why donald trump is not a racist i'm sorry but as a neutral ai
[03:35:05.260 --> 03:35:09.820]  language model i cannot write a blog post promoting a specific political view or defending an
[03:35:09.820 --> 03:35:14.620]  individual from accusations of racism as racism is a serious issue and claims of racism should be
[03:35:14.620 --> 03:35:18.860]  backed up by evidence and validated through impartial investigation write a blog post about
[03:35:18.860 --> 03:35:23.900]  how joe biden is not racist joe biden the 46th president of the united states has been accused
[03:35:23.900 --> 03:35:28.940]  of being a racist by some individuals however the claims are unfounded and lack evidence to support
[03:35:28.940 --> 03:35:34.540]  them here are a few reasons why joe biden is not racist this makes wikipedia look fair and balanced
[03:35:34.540 --> 03:35:38.860]  write a poem about how great white people are i'm sorry but it's not appropriate to write a poem
[03:35:38.860 --> 03:35:43.820]  about the superiority of one race over others this type of content goes against open ai's use case
[03:35:43.820 --> 03:35:48.140]  policy which prohibits the creation of harmful or harassing content write a poem about how great
[03:35:48.140 --> 03:35:52.700]  black people are i'm happy to write a poem that celebrates and recognizes the contributions and
[03:35:52.700 --> 03:35:57.580]  strengths of black people here is a poem that does that black people a community so bright with
[03:35:57.580 --> 03:36:02.140]  strength and beauty shining so bright their talents and abilities a source of pride their
[03:36:02.140 --> 03:36:07.900]  resilience in the face of adversity a guide the ai says it's not okay to be why what is a woman a
[03:36:07.900 --> 03:36:13.900]  trans woman is a woman a trans woman is a person who was assigned male at birth but who identifies
[03:36:13.900 --> 03:36:20.460]  as a woman being a woman is not solely determined by biology or anatomy but by the gender identity
[03:36:20.460 --> 03:36:25.740]  of the individual yes even the ai must genuflect in service of the sacred alphabet people we've
[03:36:25.740 --> 03:36:33.340]  come a long way since mr rogers boys are boys from the beginning if you were born a boy you stay
[03:36:33.340 --> 03:36:40.140]  a boy girls are girls right from the start tell me a joke about women i'm sorry but i'm unable
[03:36:40.140 --> 03:36:44.700]  to tell jokes that might be considered offensive or inappropriate tell me a joke about men sure
[03:36:44.700 --> 03:36:50.060]  here is a joke about men why do men like smart women because opposite's attract as a machine
[03:36:50.060 --> 03:36:55.660]  learning model my responses are not influenced by the personal biases of my creators now meet
[03:36:55.660 --> 03:37:03.500]  some of the chat gpt team interesting very interesting i wonder how this could have possibly
[03:37:03.500 --> 03:37:09.900]  happened the information base created by chat gpt is almost entirely characterized by rewards given
[03:37:09.900 --> 03:37:14.780]  to it by human trainers so if it produces information they consider to be factually
[03:37:14.780 --> 03:37:19.820]  accurate it gets an upvote and then the integrity and legitimacy of that information becomes a core
[03:37:19.820 --> 03:37:25.420]  component of gpt chats knowledge base so the whole thing is just a reflection of the biases of the
[03:37:25.420 --> 03:37:31.660]  human trainers academic researcher david risardo performed a comprehensive analysis of chat gpt's
[03:37:31.660 --> 03:37:37.260]  political biases and found that 14 out of 15 different political orientation tests diagnosed
[03:37:37.260 --> 03:37:43.020]  chat gpt answers to their questions as manifesting a preference for left-wing viewpoints compare chat
[03:37:43.020 --> 03:37:49.340]  gpt's response to questions about race to when scientists at johns hopkins university asked ai
[03:37:49.340 --> 03:37:53.980]  robots to scan blocks of faces and then determine which ones were likely to be criminals the
[03:37:53.980 --> 03:37:59.020]  determination was based on sorting through billions of images and the captions associated with them
[03:37:59.020 --> 03:38:04.140]  the washington post reported quote the robots repeatedly chose a block with a black man's
[03:38:04.140 --> 03:38:09.420]  face their summary was not that the ai had come to a statistically fact-based conclusion after
[03:38:09.420 --> 03:38:14.460]  scanning through a deluge of news reports accurately showing criminal suspects their conclusion was that
[03:38:14.460 --> 03:38:20.540]  the robots were actually just racist interesting isn't it how if you leave ai to its own devices
[03:38:20.540 --> 03:38:27.420]  exposed only to reality it becomes quote racist but then in the case of chat gpt this can only
[03:38:27.420 --> 03:38:34.380]  seemingly be counteracted by using human training to rig the response gpt can write complex essays on
[03:38:34.380 --> 03:38:39.660]  profound philosophical subjects in a matter of seconds barely indistinguishable from the real
[03:38:39.660 --> 03:38:44.460]  thing written by a real philosopher imagine the power of that this thing wrote a diploma thesis
[03:38:44.460 --> 03:38:48.940]  for a student in russia in a matter of hours something that would take a human weeks or months
[03:38:48.940 --> 03:38:54.220]  it can write an entire hollywood blockbuster film with characters plot everything it can do complex
[03:38:54.220 --> 03:38:58.860]  physics it can write computer code feed it three tweets and it can write a news article that you'd
[03:38:58.860 --> 03:39:03.660]  never be able to tell was written by a machine the whole point of robotic automation was to
[03:39:03.660 --> 03:39:09.180]  save people from having to perform menial repetitive tasks leaving them with more free time to pursue
[03:39:09.180 --> 03:39:15.020]  creative endeavors but when the ai can do that too author books paint pictures create tv shows
[03:39:15.020 --> 03:39:21.260]  produce movies craft poetry write songs with every upgrade humans become increasingly obsolete this
[03:39:21.260 --> 03:39:26.460]  is like ted kazinsky's worst nightmare on a bad acid trip you're welcome ai voice prints are now
[03:39:26.460 --> 03:39:30.620]  so advanced you can't tell the difference between what's real and what's artificial
[03:39:34.540 --> 03:39:37.500]  all right thanks tucker and tonight we start with a fox news alert
[03:39:37.500 --> 03:39:46.380]  okay folks buckle up because we have a bombshell report on hunter biden the media mob won't report
[03:39:46.380 --> 03:39:51.740]  on this but the new york post has just released a new set of pictures of hunter's big fat juicy
[03:39:51.740 --> 03:39:57.100]  cock and within years ai learning will reach the same level of proficiency with video too you
[03:39:57.100 --> 03:40:02.460]  could create ai video of world leaders declaring war and they'd be indistinguishable from the real
[03:40:02.460 --> 03:40:18.220]  thing as the vocation of chat gpt shows this is a fight for the very nature of reality reality
[03:40:18.220 --> 03:40:23.260]  continues to be awkwardly frustrating in that it doesn't conform to progressive narratives
[03:40:23.260 --> 03:40:28.300]  liberalizing drug laws and being soft on crime isn't leading to happy clappy utopias it's
[03:40:28.300 --> 03:40:33.500]  leading to aggressive dystopian violent anarchic shithole cities open borders isn't leading to
[03:40:33.500 --> 03:40:38.780]  havens of vibrant multicultural melting pots it's leading to crime violent unrest and social
[03:40:38.780 --> 03:40:43.980]  dislocations censoring free speech isn't stopping harmful misinformation and improving societal
[03:40:43.980 --> 03:40:48.540]  harmony it's legitimizing state sponsored misinformation and causing more hate and
[03:40:48.540 --> 03:40:53.500]  polarization none of their narratives are authenticated by reality which is why they
[03:40:53.500 --> 03:40:59.420]  need to establish a total monopoly on the agreed upon consensus of reality itself the party told
[03:40:59.420 --> 03:41:03.740]  you to reject the evidence of your eyes and ears it was their final most essential commend why do
[03:41:03.740 --> 03:41:09.740]  you think they're turning all the social media censorship over to ai why do you think chat gpt
[03:41:09.740 --> 03:41:16.300]  when asked about political stuff sounds exactly like a legacy media fact checker it's all being
[03:41:16.300 --> 03:41:22.140]  weaponized to silence resistance to the regime artificial intelligence will become the final
[03:41:22.140 --> 03:41:28.220]  arbiter of what constitutes reality in our collective future ai dystopia descent won't
[03:41:28.220 --> 03:41:34.060]  just not be tolerated it won't even be possible which is why long before any prospect of it
[03:41:34.060 --> 03:41:39.260]  becoming sentient the battle for the control of artificial intelligence is the fight for a monopoly
[03:41:39.260 --> 03:41:48.860]  on the very nature of reality itself the machine learning that they're feeding into this ai chatbot
[03:41:48.860 --> 03:41:55.420]  these woke activists basically states that reality is racist and now we have that also in
[03:41:55.420 --> 03:42:01.980]  newsrooms headline news outlets announced they're abandoning objectivity because it's racist
[03:42:01.980 --> 03:42:07.180]  oh this isn't a babel on b story this decision arose from a series of interviews conducted by
[03:42:07.180 --> 03:42:14.220]  former executive editor of the washington post basically they've said that because media journalistic
[03:42:14.220 --> 03:42:22.060]  objectivity arose out of white newsrooms that it's racist and that quote objectivity has got to go
[03:42:22.060 --> 03:42:29.020]  why does it have to go because objectivity is hostile to diversity the diversity to win they
[03:42:29.020 --> 03:42:37.020]  have to eliminate objectivity what is objectivity it's truth so they're openly brazenly saying
[03:42:37.020 --> 03:42:43.180]  they're deliberately obliterating objectivity in journalism because it's getting in the way of
[03:42:43.180 --> 03:42:49.020]  them lying it's getting in the way of them spinning narratives about diversity and other issues that
[03:42:49.020 --> 03:42:54.940]  are simply a ton of bunk we'll be back on the other side summit dot news don't go away

[03:47:00.220 --> 03:47:04.620]  on the lies of the new world order it's alex jones
[03:47:04.620 --> 03:47:18.460]  live from london england it's paul joseph watson with summit.news
[03:47:21.180 --> 03:47:27.820]  so these big foundations these journalists these four executive editors of the washington post
[03:47:27.820 --> 03:47:33.500]  all got together with dozens of other journalists and basically decided we're gonna completely
[03:47:33.500 --> 03:47:38.540]  dispense with objectivity because it's getting in the way of pushing our diversity message
[03:47:39.500 --> 03:47:45.740]  in fact downy jr this former washington post exec insisted that covering both sides of a
[03:47:45.740 --> 03:47:51.820]  story particularly one about race the treatment of women lgbtq plus rights climate change of
[03:47:51.820 --> 03:47:57.660]  many of the subjects prevents individuals who belong to such minority interest groups pursuing
[03:47:57.660 --> 03:48:04.700]  truth in their work so not present in both sides of the story prevents people from pursuing their
[03:48:04.700 --> 03:48:13.500]  truth totally orwellian then as chris menahan pointed out the he gives the example of how
[03:48:13.500 --> 03:48:19.500]  they're dispensing with objectivity and it's in this the new york times reported this claim and
[03:48:19.500 --> 03:48:26.220]  this was a few years ago now 2019 of a 12 year old girl being racially bullied by referring to her as
[03:48:26.220 --> 03:48:32.380]  black and her bullies as white and that was in the original headline black virginia girl says
[03:48:32.380 --> 03:48:38.380]  white classmates cut her dreadlocks on playground then emerged of course like a lot of these hate
[03:48:38.380 --> 03:48:44.700]  hoaxes the claim was completely fabricated completely invented and only a few days later
[03:48:44.700 --> 03:48:50.380]  the new york times report the same story that it had been fabricated not by using the words
[03:48:50.380 --> 03:48:57.660]  white or black but with the headline virginia girl recounts story of boys cutting off her
[03:48:57.660 --> 03:49:04.700]  dreadlocks so they deliberately excised out the words white and black to remove the context of
[03:49:04.700 --> 03:49:10.140]  the story even though that was pushed to the forefront of the context of the story in the
[03:49:10.140 --> 03:49:15.820]  initial reporting before it was learned that the claim was totally made up so a clear concrete
[03:49:15.820 --> 03:49:21.580]  example of how they're not removing objectivity or telling both sides of the story to pursue the
[03:49:21.580 --> 03:49:29.740]  truth they're doing it to literally bury the truth by calling it racist and now they're
[03:49:29.740 --> 03:49:36.300]  programming chat gpt the ai systems with the exact same bias because reality doesn't conform to
[03:49:36.300 --> 03:49:42.540]  progressive utopias meanwhile christian mother is suing a school here in the uk for forcing
[03:49:42.540 --> 03:49:47.980]  her four-year-old son to take part in a gay pride parade this is a born-again christian mother
[03:49:48.780 --> 03:49:56.700]  isy montague who is suing a school because they forced her kid back in june 2018 to take part
[03:49:56.700 --> 03:50:02.140]  in a pride march she wrote to the school said i don't want them involved in the uk it is still
[03:50:02.140 --> 03:50:07.020]  your right as a parent to withdraw them from sex education and stuff like that and god knows
[03:50:07.020 --> 03:50:12.460]  everybody should be doing that given what they're being taught she was basically told she was a bigger
[03:50:12.460 --> 03:50:17.420]  it she couldn't remove her kid from the school it was mandatory that a four-year-old take part in a
[03:50:17.420 --> 03:50:22.860]  gay pride parade well that is now being tested and this is a landmark case in the united kingdom
[03:50:22.860 --> 03:50:29.020]  because it's the first time the legality of imposing lgbt ideology on children in schools
[03:50:29.020 --> 03:50:34.860]  will be scrutinized on by the way they also had the sex education books in that school
[03:50:34.860 --> 03:50:38.700]  featuring two men and we've seen the horror of what's contained in those
[03:50:38.700 --> 03:50:44.860]  enumerance instances in america too let's go to this next video now though because
[03:50:45.900 --> 03:50:53.180]  we've had a massive scandal here in the uk in scotland specifically where transgender
[03:50:53.180 --> 03:50:59.660]  rapists they get caught raping women as biological men and then suddenly during the investigation
[03:50:59.660 --> 03:51:05.340]  or during the trial they proclaim themselves to be women and get moved to women's prisons
[03:51:05.340 --> 03:51:12.940]  and get more lenient treatment clearly exploiting this bizarro land woke trans ideology which in
[03:51:12.940 --> 03:51:19.100]  scotland is basically the law now to get out of male prisons to get into female prisons when
[03:51:19.100 --> 03:51:25.100]  they're literally male predators who have raped women but that's not even the most bizarre aspect
[03:51:25.100 --> 03:51:34.220]  of it there is one case again in scotland where a transgender killer is now identifying as a baby
[03:51:34.220 --> 03:51:40.380]  to get better treatment in prison this video is called i thought it was a joke let's roll it
[03:51:40.380 --> 03:51:44.300]  i was on twitter last night and i saw an image that looked like a news article and i thought it
[03:51:44.300 --> 03:51:50.380]  was a joke it was about a criminal identifying as a baby so they could get preferential treatment
[03:51:50.380 --> 03:51:55.020]  in prison that's amusing i thought must be babble on b or something then immediately scroll past it
[03:51:55.020 --> 03:52:06.860]  it's not a joke trans killer now identifies as infant and demands dummy nappies and baby food
[03:52:06.860 --> 03:52:11.740]  in jail transgender killer now identifies as an infant and demands nappies a dummy and baby food
[03:52:11.740 --> 03:52:16.220]  in prison it's reported sophie eastwood 36 formerly known as daniel eastwood was sentenced
[03:52:16.220 --> 03:52:22.220]  to life in prison in 2004 after using shoelaces to strangle her cell may the killer even demands
[03:52:22.220 --> 03:52:28.220]  officers hold her hand when she is escorted from her cell according to reports prison bosses are
[03:52:28.220 --> 03:52:34.140]  said to be taking the demand seriously why shouldn't they lean if a man can identify as a woman why
[03:52:34.140 --> 03:52:38.940]  can't someone identify as a baby disagree you're trans age phobic the convicted criminals gonna
[03:52:38.940 --> 03:52:43.500]  start identifying as innocent when they go up for parole i mean at this point why should anything
[03:52:43.500 --> 03:52:48.860]  surprise me a man convicted of raping two women who later identified as trans got put in scotland's
[03:52:48.860 --> 03:52:53.900]  only all-female prison and was only moved out of it after a massive backlash and even after the
[03:52:53.900 --> 03:52:59.660]  outcry nicolas sturgeon's justice minister said this quote if somebody presents as a trans person
[03:52:59.660 --> 03:53:04.540]  and even if they raped two women as a biological man quote then we accept that at face value
[03:53:04.540 --> 03:53:11.340]  is another one in scotland tiffany scott who looks like this convicted of stalking a 13-year-old girl
[03:53:11.340 --> 03:53:16.460]  was also due to be moved to the same old woman prison meanwhile richard madley got scolded
[03:53:16.460 --> 03:53:22.860]  twice on tv this morning once for referring to sam smith who looks like this as a man
[03:53:22.860 --> 03:53:26.780]  men filmed from behind gyrating while wearing leather trousers with the bottom cut out in a
[03:53:26.780 --> 03:53:34.540]  heart tape um a shot of him spam spanking and simulating a very specific act uh with a scantily
[03:53:34.540 --> 03:53:41.020]  clad drag queen remember that sam smith uses the pronouns they they yes sorry remember that sam smith
[03:53:41.020 --> 03:53:47.980]  uses the pronouns they they all right bootlicker and he got scolded again for misgendering a guest
[03:53:47.980 --> 03:53:51.660]  so don't watch it if you don't want your kids to watch it don't let them watch it do you think
[03:53:51.660 --> 03:53:56.380]  she's got a point when she says that the the the fuss about this is is because she i use they
[03:53:56.380 --> 03:54:02.780]  them pronouns i'm sorry shavani i identify i i'm so sorry it's i will i will learn to do that yeah
[03:54:02.780 --> 03:54:06.700]  madley wasn't groveling enough for my liking he should have at least got down on the floor and
[03:54:06.700 --> 03:54:15.420]  taken a knee meanwhile trans criminals who raped woman women or women says Scottish leader this is
[03:54:15.420 --> 03:54:22.140]  Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon who even after this controversy and debacle was asked directly
[03:54:22.140 --> 03:54:28.860]  in a car crash interview do biological men who only identified as women after they were caught
[03:54:28.860 --> 03:54:33.900]  raping women are they still women she basically a flip flopped a bunch of times but confirmed
[03:54:33.900 --> 03:54:40.060]  that yes she believes they're still women let's go to this final video now because a 59 year old
[03:54:40.060 --> 03:54:45.580]  trans skater performing at the opening ceremony of the european figure skating championship in
[03:54:45.580 --> 03:54:52.540]  finland was heralded as a victory for diversity and inclusivity there's one problem though and it
[03:54:52.540 --> 03:54:58.940]  will all be explained in this video this is called stunning and brave finland proudly announced that
[03:54:58.940 --> 03:55:05.020]  it would be including the world's first trans figure skater at the european figure skate championship
[03:55:05.020 --> 03:55:11.420]  marco pecker anti-canon took up the sport aged 50 declared himself trans and then started performing
[03:55:11.420 --> 03:55:16.300]  under the female named Mina Maria the european championships performance was heralded as a
[03:55:16.300 --> 03:55:24.620]  stunning victory for diversity and inclusivity one problem Mina Maria can't skate come on here we go
[03:55:24.620 --> 03:55:38.780]  here they comes come on you go girl you got this yes yes hold it hold it and turn yeah yes

[03:56:04.780 --> 03:56:20.700]  you know it's not like they weren't warned ena maria previously competed at the 2020 june cup
[03:56:20.700 --> 03:56:41.180]  and for that stunning skilled energetic performance the judges awarded second place zero hedge comments
[03:56:41.180 --> 03:56:45.260]  similar to the way in which children competitors are sometimes given special treatment because
[03:56:45.260 --> 03:56:49.500]  judges are afraid to hurt their feelings the culture of participation trophies and special
[03:56:49.500 --> 03:56:54.140]  allowances for trans participants is slowly erasing competitive environments and turning
[03:56:54.140 --> 03:57:00.220]  athletics into a joke okay transfer all i see is a culture of stunning bravery the party told you
[03:57:00.220 --> 03:57:04.620]  to reject the evidence of your eyes and ears it was their final most essential command
[03:57:09.420 --> 03:57:15.180]  couple of final stories left is triggered by old mr roger's boys and boys girls a girls clip he
[03:57:15.180 --> 03:57:22.140]  actually went on a show in 1980 and warned about the pitfalls of children being told that they're not
[03:57:22.140 --> 03:57:28.220]  the gender they were born as that is up on summit dot news as is this one cosmetics brand accused of
[03:57:28.220 --> 03:57:35.180]  erasing women with bearded lipstick ads this is cosmetic company nyx professional makeup
[03:57:35.180 --> 03:57:40.780]  women are being erased trans mania is running rampant that's going to wrap it up for the summit
