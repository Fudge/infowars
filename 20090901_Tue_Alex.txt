[11:34.640 --> 11:37.800]  you know that just happened at my house because we don't like to use really bad
[11:37.800 --> 11:40.640]  pesticides because we have children we don't want them to get cancer when
[11:40.640 --> 11:45.120]  they're 15 or have their livers rot they get enough pesticide in the food they
[11:45.120 --> 11:48.640]  eat you know from the vegetables it's it's in everything it's in the air we
[11:48.640 --> 11:52.600]  don't want brain damage children like everybody else has so we you know we got

[11:55.640 --> 11:59.400]  occasionally weevils and things but even though our house is super clean the
[11:59.400 --> 12:03.760]  point is that that's what we got with the government we got an infestation of
[12:03.760 --> 12:12.600]  maggots though eating our flesh screw worms the type that eat living flesh and
[12:12.600 --> 12:17.320]  we better wake up to it ladies and gentlemen because we're in trouble
[12:17.320 --> 12:21.960]  government's like a 200 pound tick on a hundred pound dog and it ain't gonna stop
[12:21.960 --> 12:26.320]  and now the dog's kind of struggling as it's figuring out it's gonna die the
[12:26.320 --> 12:29.720]  parasites is grabbing at that much harder with its stinking breath and
[12:29.720 --> 12:33.280]  sucking what's left of the blood out it doesn't care it's gonna crawl off try to
[12:33.280 --> 12:36.960]  find something else go to a new country and the new world order knows people run
[12:36.960 --> 12:41.200]  from a tether nation so the tick world government is now the tick attaching
[12:41.200 --> 12:45.960]  itself to every nation and then the tick has turned its parasitism its
[12:45.960 --> 12:50.880]  parasitic activity into a religion called eugenics to rationalize all of its
[12:50.880 --> 12:56.200]  activities now I called Paul Watson up he's got his family in town in Sheffield
[12:56.200 --> 13:04.120]  he's over in England and Paul's doing a big story about anarchist provocateurs
[13:04.120 --> 13:08.040]  trying to shut down the tea parties and trying to shut down the end the
[13:08.040 --> 13:15.160]  federales foundation bought and paid for and he's also getting me together a
[13:15.160 --> 13:22.320]  folder is because this this this HDTV interview HD net interview snuck up on
[13:22.320 --> 13:26.520]  me and so he's gonna get me a folder together and email it over because
[13:26.520 --> 13:31.280]  they're getting here about an hour and a half you know just just a few dozen or
[13:31.280 --> 13:35.640]  so there's hundreds and hundreds of German news reporting that all the major
[13:35.640 --> 13:43.080]  white supremacist groups were founded and run firebombing innocent Turkish
[13:43.080 --> 13:46.680]  immigrants again to have crackdowns on free speech in Germany and take everybody's
[13:46.680 --> 13:54.120]  rights British white supremacist and IRA on record all founded run by MI6 MI5
[13:54.120 --> 13:59.080]  Hamas founded by Israel Haritz Jerusalem Post reporting send me that
[13:59.080 --> 14:04.240]  poll Elohim City founded run by the Southern Parvy Law Center running
[14:04.240 --> 14:09.560]  McVay FBI documents just came out last year major white supremacist groups all
[14:09.560 --> 14:16.520]  over Florida up into Maryland Texas run by the Feds Miami Herald what's the other
[14:16.520 --> 14:19.400]  big article on that one I'm just pulling these up from memory there's just
[14:19.400 --> 14:25.040]  hundreds and hundreds one was a Orlando Sentinel I'd like that one the commander
[14:25.040 --> 14:30.440]  the founder FBI not just FBI infiltrating they run them all these
[14:30.440 --> 14:35.920]  black groups from Miami to Toronto supposedly gonna blow stuff up turns out
[14:35.920 --> 14:44.960]  their feds fed run Viper militia fed run Fed founded Fed run Hal Turner Fed run
[14:44.960 --> 14:49.400]  we told you that some good hackers hacked in and exposed that years ago now
[14:49.400 --> 14:54.200]  it's been confirmed in court FBI admits it but says you know he hasn't been one
[14:54.200 --> 15:00.960]  for a year yeah since we blew his cover so all of that going on and by the way
[15:00.960 --> 15:07.160]  every time I get hit by the Cointel pro feds when I say the anarchist are feds
[15:07.160 --> 15:11.880]  that doesn't mean if you're an anarchist you're a fed you have anarchist beliefs
[15:11.880 --> 15:16.440]  extreme and I do call them extreme because it isn't workable it isn't
[15:16.440 --> 15:22.080]  livable you have liberty on one end of the spectrum and you have you know
[15:22.080 --> 15:25.400]  government of four about people a republic constitutional Republic where
[15:25.400 --> 15:31.320]  the minority is protected above the majority or 51% can't gang rape the
[15:31.320 --> 15:37.680]  rights of the 49% two wolves and a sheep voting on what's for dinner as Benjamin
[15:37.680 --> 15:45.800]  Franklin said that's democracy but but I agree with about 95% of real anarchist
[15:45.800 --> 15:53.840]  methodology and ideas but I have the video the raw footage I have the newscast
[15:53.840 --> 15:59.960]  I have mainstream news but saying it's good thing that in 1999 we reported this
[15:59.960 --> 16:04.640]  six months for it happened in Oregon they were training at Ford Foundation and
[16:04.640 --> 16:11.520]  Annenberg Foundation and Soros funded compounds armies of anarchists to be
[16:11.520 --> 16:17.920]  flown all over the world to demonize anti-globalization demonstrators you
[16:17.920 --> 16:25.280]  got 60,000 clean-cut good-looking black-white old young Asian Muslim
[16:25.280 --> 16:30.240]  Christian Catholic agnostic didn't matter out there with their baby carriages and

[17:00.840 --> 17:07.040]  they came in and they attacked the police and the police were ordered to
[17:07.040 --> 17:12.440]  stand down and the national news pointed their cameras at them and said
[17:12.440 --> 17:15.120]  look the police won't do anything about the protesters and they were pulled
[17:15.120 --> 17:18.240]  back put in a government building protected by police and the peaceful
[17:18.240 --> 17:21.840]  people the next day had their collarbones broken old women stopped the

[17:52.080 --> 18:00.200]  the report put out by the Missouri Information Analysis Center which dated
[18:00.200 --> 18:05.600]  or implied that Ron Paul supporters libertarians people who display political
[18:05.600 --> 18:12.440]  bumper stickers were domestic terrorists now there was a hearing I believe it's
[18:12.440 --> 18:16.960]  the third hearing out of five took place on that last night yeah we've got a
[18:16.960 --> 18:23.080]  witness coming on the last 30 minutes today who was there also Chuck Baldwin's

[18:27.080 --> 18:31.200]  there was another witness there who was one of the organizers of one of the
[18:31.200 --> 18:36.600]  protest groups at the end the Fed rallies which took place in November last
[18:36.600 --> 18:44.040]  year and of course as it came to light in March were monitored very closely by
[18:44.040 --> 18:49.920]  the United States Army Reserve Command who put out a document before warning
[18:49.920 --> 18:54.960]  that the protest is about to take place and implying that those protesting
[18:54.960 --> 18:59.360]  against the Fed were essentially domestic terrorists don't let them know
[18:59.360 --> 19:04.000]  you're with army intelligence or they may kill you yeah exactly so they could
[19:04.000 --> 19:11.280]  be violent and so this was testimony given by a organizer of a protest group
[19:11.280 --> 19:20.800]  yesterday called CC Reagan who were told the representatives that one of the
[19:20.800 --> 19:26.720]  protests and the Fed protest there was an anarchist group who started
[19:26.720 --> 19:31.520]  canvassing and talking to all the protesters that was there trying to
[19:31.520 --> 19:35.960]  recruit them and telling them that they should commit illegal act they were
[19:35.960 --> 19:41.040]  trying to rewrite their sign so they were essentially provocaturing them and

[27:46.200 --> 27:53.040]  organizer testimony that said quote my group was at the end the Fed rally and
[27:53.040 --> 27:56.280]  there were a bunch of different groups there and there was this group of
[27:56.280 --> 28:00.480]  anarchists who started talking to us and then they tried to recruit us or have
[28:00.480 --> 28:04.840]  us join their group then they started telling us what we should write on our
[28:04.840 --> 28:09.480]  signs and insisting on letting them rewrite our signs like that we overheard
[28:09.480 --> 28:14.480]  them saying they couldn't even get us to jaywalk and the fact that they're
[28:14.480 --> 28:20.400]  trying to get them to commit petty crimes within direct contrast to the
[28:20.400 --> 28:25.080]  guidelines which were published by the end of Fed organized and it's totally
[28:25.080 --> 28:29.520]  illegal it's totally illegal to have the police out there dressed up and with
[28:29.520 --> 28:33.920]  their provocateurs saying come on let's commit crime I mean that's more than
[28:33.920 --> 28:39.040]  entreatment and I want them to go to prison you evil anti-american scum

[28:44.120 --> 28:48.720]  that's just the quote so they were out there trying to get the legitimate
[28:48.720 --> 28:52.920]  protesters to commit crimes even though it was vehemently stressed before the
[28:52.920 --> 28:57.640]  quote no blocking of pedestrian or vehicular traffic should take place
[28:57.640 --> 29:02.160]  so and remember senator menaces thing in Oregon you ought to pull that bill up
[29:02.160 --> 29:05.240]  where they said if you block traffic life in prison in a forced labor camp

[29:10.120 --> 29:16.720]  jiblet in there for folks and don't forget the SPP protesting 2007 where the
[29:16.720 --> 29:21.880]  Quebec police were caught posing as rock-wielding anarchists trying to do
[29:21.880 --> 29:26.560]  chaos and they have to admit that that was the case they were hitting cops with
[29:26.560 --> 29:30.920]  it hitting other police total criminals they just would love to line people up

[32:04.440 --> 32:09.040]  Russia and China have now penetrated our power grid even as energy experts are
[32:09.040 --> 32:12.800]  reporting that each summer we get closer and closer to the limits of our nation's
[32:12.800 --> 32:17.120]  power grid some say that this summer's demand for electrical power may finally
[32:17.120 --> 32:21.560]  push the grid over its edge creating a cascade of power outages across the
[32:21.560 --> 32:26.320]  country putting us all in the dark are you prepared for the next round of storm
[32:26.320 --> 32:30.200]  related outages or government created blackouts have you ever thought about
[32:30.200 --> 32:34.520]  taking steps to get off the grid and generate your own private supply of
[32:34.520 --> 32:38.880]  electrical power if so this will be the most important information you have ever
[32:38.880 --> 32:43.280]  heard solar powered generators are finally available they have no moving
[32:43.280 --> 32:47.880]  parts to wear out or break and require absolutely no gas whatsoever
[32:47.880 --> 32:53.120]  remember the government doesn't own the sun so go to my solar backup comm that's

[33:24.400 --> 33:29.440]  violates the Bill of Rights Constitution out in the open the police I've caught
[33:29.440 --> 33:36.840]  them in Austin Texas at the fortune 500 and what 99 I have caught them in Denver
[33:36.840 --> 33:43.280]  we have caught them in England and in Italy and in Canada and in Russia I mean
[33:43.280 --> 33:49.000]  all these governments do it I've never found a clan group or a white
[33:49.000 --> 33:53.800]  supremacist group or a black supremacist group or a Mexican supremacist group
[33:53.800 --> 33:59.840]  that isn't Ford Foundation funded one way or the other I mean it's ridiculous

[34:23.520 --> 34:29.440]  say it's not about race or party you bet it is I mean they are just obsessed
[34:29.440 --> 34:35.280]  with injecting race and making everything racial and I'm so sick of you and
[34:35.280 --> 34:40.840]  everybody's starting to see through all your race pimping every day big

[34:59.440 --> 35:03.560]  beer bottles and rocks at other cops in some cases the cops don't even know
[35:03.560 --> 35:07.080]  they'll go over and before a commander stops them we'll find out it was staged
[35:07.080 --> 35:11.640]  and then the cops complained to the media that's how we found out in Denver in
[35:11.640 --> 35:16.040]  other cases the cops are part of it but in Seattle it was police that came out
[35:16.040 --> 35:18.960]  and said yeah these people were working for the government and they allowed them
[35:18.960 --> 35:22.360]  to attack us and I'm angry about it
[35:25.760 --> 35:30.240]  again the foundations openly are the private political arms of the big private
[35:30.240 --> 35:34.040]  banks that are setting up the world dictatorship the man of the world and so
[35:34.040 --> 35:39.040]  they are the ones that openly fund the anarchist who are not anarchist every
[35:39.040 --> 35:42.880]  time you go it's like 20 year old college kids with big red stars and big
[35:42.880 --> 35:46.880]  tattoos of Mao and linen on them I mean literally like Mike Tyson with Mao's
[35:46.880 --> 35:52.720]  arm and they'll say yeah we're with the revolutionary youth brigade of Maoist
[35:52.720 --> 36:01.760]  youth brigade and then next will be one anarchy and they're there to create the
[36:01.760 --> 36:06.440]  anarchy bought and paid for I mean I've seen it where you'll have some six foot
[36:06.440 --> 36:11.240]  four huge cop with huge arms commanding a scraggly group of meth head
[36:11.240 --> 36:17.160]  pension fund kids who get flown all over the world to do this and the cops will
[36:17.160 --> 36:22.280]  step aside they'll let them march right through into a crowd they got caught in
[36:22.280 --> 36:28.680]  Denver witnesses and it later was confirmed would see vans pull up and
[36:28.680 --> 36:33.600]  U.S. Marines would get out in the park in the early morning hours they would
[36:33.600 --> 36:38.840]  then change clothes in the vans and run around stirring trouble up all day I mean
[36:38.840 --> 36:43.920]  I you know the Marine Corps the Army the Delta Force this is who they are and
[36:43.920 --> 36:48.120]  you know how they do it I could play newscast for newscast I played on what
[36:48.120 --> 36:54.080]  two weeks ago out of Maine with the flu drill just Google Maine military
[36:54.080 --> 36:58.560]  transfer flu quarantine and we've got them from South Carolina and all over the
[36:58.560 --> 37:02.080]  country where they have the Marines in the Army and regular Army and National
[37:02.080 --> 37:05.880]  Guard and the rest of it come out and quote new drills of attacking local
[37:05.880 --> 37:09.400]  police and the military and then they go out and run real checkpoints on the
[37:09.400 --> 37:12.920]  highway after and that's how they tell these young stupid usually it's very
[37:12.920 --> 37:16.080]  young Marines and Army but then commanding them will be Delta Force or
[37:16.080 --> 37:20.000]  psyops or Army intelligence they'll say yeah we're going out here to do a live
[37:20.000 --> 37:23.920]  action drill but don't don't tell the public they don't know and you're gonna
[37:23.920 --> 37:27.360]  go up and hit the police all right and you're gonna dress like this they're
[37:27.360 --> 37:35.520]  like oh kind sergeant you think it's funny let me tell you something you
[37:35.520 --> 37:38.560]  young Marines and Army people if this stuff really goes the way these
[37:38.560 --> 37:42.880]  globalists plan you have any idea what your job is gonna be like when you're
[37:42.880 --> 37:46.640]  trying to go up against the American people you stupid fools but they're
[37:46.640 --> 37:50.080]  training you just like you train an attack dog on a dummy at first and then
[37:50.080 --> 37:53.480]  a guy dressed up in an outfit that's with pads on it is meant to be able to
[37:53.480 --> 37:56.760]  take bites and that's what you're being trained on before you're really put up
[37:56.760 --> 38:01.880]  against the real bears so you're getting trained on little stuff there you think
[38:01.880 --> 38:08.320]  you're real tough you think it's real cute think it's all real funny in fact
[38:08.320 --> 38:16.400]  I've got a couple articles here out of some magazines I bought when I was in
[38:16.400 --> 38:21.800]  the airport and one of them is popular science the future of remote control
[38:21.800 --> 38:26.440]  warfare and here it is oh you know this guy was a top video game player and
[38:26.440 --> 38:30.280]  simulations and it just so happens the Pentagon designed those simulations it's
[38:30.280 --> 38:33.200]  kind of like the last starfighter but you know that that's all the predictive
[38:33.200 --> 38:36.480]  programming they put out there for people and then now he's flying predator
[38:36.480 --> 38:41.280]  and green reapers killing enemies soon the whole Air Force will be robotic then
[38:41.280 --> 38:44.240]  they're gonna get rid of the human controllers they're wargaming the
[38:44.240 --> 38:47.800]  different algorithms of human controllers and moves humans make with the big
[38:47.800 --> 38:51.120]  AI computers watching and all and soon the globalist will be able to launch
[38:51.120 --> 38:56.360]  giant wars without any human help in the first phases and then just human
[38:56.360 --> 39:00.200]  technicians over the machine factories and then that's the next phase then
[39:00.200 --> 39:05.400]  after that no humans involved and the globalists will have their mechanized
[39:05.400 --> 39:10.400]  army they'll be in control of Skynet that's in 1968 documents put out of the
[39:10.400 --> 39:17.040]  Pentagon yeah Terminator is based James Cameron's movie is based on what
[39:17.040 --> 39:20.520]  they're really planning does that mean they're gonna get to that level no but
[39:20.520 --> 39:24.440]  that's what they're trying remember the article in AP a few months ago flash
[39:24.440 --> 39:29.480]  shooting robots that feed themselves off your blood this is what they're doing
[39:29.480 --> 39:34.600]  but Skynet is in the control of a crazy computer it's in the control of the
[39:34.600 --> 39:38.920]  eugenicist it's in the control of John P. Holdren it's in the control of David
[39:38.920 --> 39:47.840]  Rockefeller that's Skynet that's what this is look I can rant and rave all
[39:47.840 --> 39:52.360]  day I'm gonna give the number out I'm gonna take calls right now one eight
[39:52.360 --> 39:56.960]  hundred two five nine ninety two thirty one one eight hundred two five nine
[39:56.960 --> 40:00.640]  ninety two thirty one and we're gonna talk to Mike Rivera about a host of
[40:00.640 --> 40:04.200]  issues but also just take your calls the entire time he's on and then I'm doing
[40:04.200 --> 40:08.760]  two hours on the demonization of the militia movement now they're taking over
[40:08.760 --> 40:22.080]  while Mark Cuban's HDTV network is here so that is coming up one eight hundred
[40:22.080 --> 40:30.120]  two five nine ninety two thirty one the phones are open and I've got this article
[40:30.120 --> 40:33.160]  out of Minnesota we're gonna get to when Rivera's here in fact guys will you
[40:33.160 --> 40:40.360]  reprint me this story she's walking the tightrope on flu it's some reason it
[40:40.360 --> 40:43.720]  didn't print the back page for me because because that's the quote it's got the
[40:43.720 --> 40:46.800]  quote about how they're gonna lock the city down and put police cars the end
[40:46.800 --> 40:50.800]  of your street and and again this will probably just come and go and kill of
[40:50.800 --> 40:54.640]  10 20,000 people less than the regular flu but they'll fear monger you and
[40:54.640 --> 40:58.960]  trying you to be a prisoner hands-off plan schools ban touching to fight H1N1
[40:58.960 --> 41:02.760]  again this is all part of the new medical tyranny
[41:04.520 --> 41:12.080]  Rasmussen had a daily poll two weekends ago at 41% they're saying 41% strongly
[41:12.080 --> 41:17.240]  disapprove of the president that's a new poll out today but then when I see it on
[41:17.240 --> 41:25.320]  CNN they keep saying Rasmussen says 45 and Zogby says 42 and I've got both
[41:25.320 --> 41:29.120]  those articles here so what they do is they look at one little demographic in
[41:29.120 --> 41:33.800]  the media and then report on his low poll numbers by using the highest
[41:33.800 --> 41:38.520]  demographic he's got but his real demographics are 41 and 42 that's the
[41:38.520 --> 41:43.040]  general poll number I wanted to get to the bottom of this last night as I was
[41:43.040 --> 41:45.640]  watching CNN while I was eating a late-night dinner up here working on
[41:45.640 --> 41:52.080]  fall the Republic Presidency of Arraquage Obama coming out October 21st and I
[41:52.080 --> 41:56.800]  saw that so that is coming up so
[42:01.160 --> 42:05.360]  oh I before I go to your calls here just a moment I do want to just let people
[42:05.360 --> 42:08.800]  know I'm getting all these emails saying is your big announcement next Tuesday
[42:08.800 --> 42:13.840]  that you're gonna be on some sky television channel that somebody leases
[42:13.840 --> 42:17.960]  and owns and this went by my desk about a month ago they want to play my
[42:17.960 --> 42:23.440]  prison planet dot TV show I told them I don't even have the staff to download
[42:23.440 --> 42:26.680]  this and give it to them they can just grab it if they want I told them I
[42:26.680 --> 42:31.240]  haven't even had time to look at the contract they've got that's how busy we
[42:31.240 --> 42:34.920]  are we don't even have personnel to give a high quality copy of this to an
[42:34.920 --> 42:40.560]  international TV network I mean I you know and I can only do what I can do I
[42:40.560 --> 42:47.040]  can only make the film do the website do the events we do have the guest on we
[42:47.040 --> 42:53.520]  have on but yes we're blowing up at every level and there's some private
[42:53.520 --> 42:57.080]  folks I want to get them on who again Lisa channel they want to put me on
[42:57.080 --> 43:01.440]  that'll be on sky all over Europe in England and I'm just been so busy I
[43:01.440 --> 43:05.400]  haven't even tracked that down so no that's not the big announcement and the
[43:05.400 --> 43:08.400]  big announcement is not that I'm a consultant on and will probably appear
[43:08.400 --> 43:11.120]  they're saying four to seven of the seven episodes either four of them or
[43:11.120 --> 43:14.480]  all seven I they don't know of the Jesse Ventura show no that's not the big
[43:14.480 --> 43:19.080]  announcement it's big though and it's coming up
[43:19.080 --> 43:24.960]  Tuesday September 8th you believe we're almost to the eighth
[43:24.960 --> 43:28.440]  anniversary of the stage terror attack and that's a whole nother issue like I
[43:28.440 --> 43:32.160]  will spend 15 minutes at the end of the show if I have time and that's a whole
[43:32.160 --> 43:36.760]  another thing I sat there while I was eating dinner last night channel
[43:36.760 --> 43:41.280]  surfing and I watched 20 minutes of news and I went to watch 20 minutes of the
[43:41.280 --> 43:50.880]  ridiculous new National Geographic now they put out an apology saying their last
[43:50.880 --> 43:54.200]  show was wrong the pancake theory is wrong because this has had to admit
[43:54.200 --> 43:58.760]  that's a fraud the feds have had to admit it this was like it was a joke like
[43:58.760 --> 44:04.360]  they were trying to make themselves look stupid they fire a missile with a pound
[44:04.360 --> 44:09.360]  of plastic explosives into a fiberglass I mean not even a half-inch thick
[44:09.360 --> 44:15.200]  chicken coop it is a chicken coop that I think they lazily went out and actually
[44:15.200 --> 44:18.000]  bought a chicken coop I've seen these fiberglass chicken coops you just didn't
[44:18.000 --> 44:23.680]  have little subdividers in it and they fire a missile into it and it blows up
[44:23.680 --> 44:26.920]  and they say see a missile would have blown up the whole Pentagon I mean this
[44:26.920 --> 44:31.560]  was like it was made for three-year-olds that have been given lobotomies it was
[44:31.560 --> 44:35.640]  it was unsp- I saw 20 minutes of it and then I came back in later when it was on
[44:35.640 --> 44:39.600]  we were recording it and watch like five minutes at the end I mean it was an
[44:39.600 --> 44:48.280]  absolute asinine joke and the people they had who were against the 9-11
[44:48.280 --> 44:52.520]  truthers were well-spoken focused they use the very clips of where they were
[44:52.520 --> 44:58.080]  authoritative and then you can tell they probably interviewed Gage and and and
[44:58.080 --> 45:03.360]  others for for days and then use the few little times that they were hesitant or
[45:03.360 --> 45:05.880]  thoughtful to make it look like they were bumbling but they still did a
[45:05.880 --> 45:11.120]  pretty good job and Stephen Jones but they use the parts where they look
[45:11.120 --> 45:15.080]  completely clueless that's why they don't really put me in those TV shows
[45:15.080 --> 45:18.360]  they'll only do it they come to public events I'm at where they can try to
[45:18.360 --> 45:30.840]  stage things but we're gonna see what goes on with that let's talk to Gary in
[45:30.840 --> 45:34.240]  Arizona Gary you're on the air
[45:36.120 --> 45:41.760]  okay Gary doesn't want to talk let him go Mike in Wyoming Mike you're on the
[45:41.760 --> 45:52.920]  air hello Alex hey hey you used to have some great sections like 9-11 and on
[45:52.920 --> 45:58.000]  Freemasonry I can't find those anymore are they are they squirreled away
[45:58.000 --> 46:02.880]  somewhere I'd be willing to set up my own website to just have those available
[46:02.880 --> 46:07.320]  as yeah now Paul Watson and others created archives if you just Google
[46:07.320 --> 46:13.480]  prison planet Freemasonry archive prison planet and 9-11 archive they're all
[46:13.480 --> 46:17.040]  there there's just tabs up at the top that link through to the older pages we
[46:17.040 --> 46:19.760]  just don't have the money and the personnel and I can turn the whole
[46:19.760 --> 46:22.720]  show into nothing but an infomercial and then there's it's just it's a catch
[46:22.720 --> 46:27.120]  22 I just people they want to see more sections and more webmasters and more
[46:27.120 --> 46:30.960]  material but I've also got to spend time managing things if I don't manage
[46:30.960 --> 46:35.120]  people around my office nothing will happen either so it just it just turns
[46:35.120 --> 46:39.600]  into a hall of mirrors and I'm not bitching I just am not a corporate
[46:39.600 --> 46:43.440]  manager I'm a filmmaker and a radio host but yes we're trying Mike yes those
[46:43.440 --> 46:48.280]  archives are up there you're the hardest-working guy I know out there so
[46:48.280 --> 46:52.680]  I'm certainly not complaining about that I just no no no no I'm complaining I'm
[46:52.680 --> 46:57.440]  complaining I mean I mean I wish we just had some benefactor where I just had
[46:57.440 --> 47:00.440]  millions of dollars and I could just pay for all this because believe me I don't
[47:00.440 --> 47:04.480]  like having to spend my time in fact I've even turned down a lot of advertising
[47:04.480 --> 47:07.480]  because I just don't want to have more things to plug and more things to cover
[47:07.480 --> 47:11.200]  because it just turns into an endless you know it's just an it's just it's just
[47:11.200 --> 47:17.360]  endless it's I don't you know sure so by Google prison planet 9-11 archives
[47:17.360 --> 47:22.760]  that should bring it up yes or info wars 9-11 archive okay all right great
[47:22.760 --> 47:28.080]  thank you anything else Mike no sir thank you good to hear from you WC in
[47:28.080 --> 47:36.920]  Texas you're on the air go ahead I'd like to point out a couple of victories
[47:36.920 --> 47:41.520]  we're having here in the Houston area I on a regular basis because I've got all
[47:41.520 --> 47:45.360]  this free time my hand now that I'm rehabbing my shoulder I've been using it
[47:45.360 --> 47:49.640]  to my advantage I call in regularly on local radio here and there's one
[47:49.640 --> 47:53.840]  specific radio station it's a clear channel station but they do come on was
[47:53.840 --> 47:58.640]  convinced now that the people over there are wide awake and they allow me to get
[47:58.640 --> 48:04.120]  on every day and talk about different issues I've got to mention things about
[48:04.120 --> 48:08.880]  swine flu squailing all kind of stuff so I think that's what's I mean let me
[48:08.880 --> 48:13.040]  explain only top editors and top individuals in key position or
[48:13.040 --> 48:16.960]  government operatives and even they're upset I've talked to some of them who
[48:16.960 --> 48:20.600]  like wink wink you know I know you're telling the truth because I'm in the
[48:20.600 --> 48:25.520]  system and we're sick of it too Alex and that's exactly what's happening is an
[48:25.520 --> 48:32.080]  illusion is what keeps everybody in line an illusion that that the system was
[48:32.080 --> 48:36.000]  telling the truth once that illusions over and once people realize that people
[48:36.000 --> 48:39.160]  that want freedom of the majority it's all over for the New World Order and
[48:39.160 --> 48:44.400]  this handful of corrupt potbellied bastard bankers
[48:44.400 --> 48:49.040]  verbal jiu-jitsu that I like to use on them because you can always hammer them
[48:49.040 --> 48:51.680]  when they're when they're sitting there lying I mean because it takes so much
[48:51.680 --> 48:55.440]  energy to remember a lot but the truth rolls right off your tongue and it
[48:55.440 --> 49:00.760]  registers and you know that but also there's a radio station here that the
[49:00.760 --> 49:06.800]  Obama worship on 90.1 in Houston is absolute audible ever cat it is sickening
[49:06.800 --> 49:11.480]  and I try to call in and be the voice in the wilderness and more folks are
[49:11.480 --> 49:16.040]  calling in too but you know I just like to hammer on the positive we are having
[49:16.040 --> 49:21.280]  victories but always keep knowing that our enemy is always changing and another
[49:21.280 --> 49:25.680]  thing that I've seen actually was this morning on Fox News the old Steve
[49:25.680 --> 49:29.760]  douchey rolling his sleeve up taking his flu shot and they said right there oh
[49:29.760 --> 49:33.320]  well it won't protect against swine flu that won't be out till next month
[49:33.320 --> 49:37.520]  everybody knows October's a matter just like they admit Gardasil doesn't
[49:37.520 --> 49:41.280]  protect girls from cancer on the drug insert but it kills a bunch of people
[49:41.280 --> 49:45.120]  and people go I don't care if it kills my daughter I'd rather be dead than get
[49:45.120 --> 49:52.880]  warts you know it's amazing sir but you know what I'm positive every day I know
[49:52.880 --> 49:58.080]  that we're doing great here I've called him before with Houston truth.org we're
[49:58.080 --> 50:01.520]  doing good things here in the community and Alex this is a huge market if we
[50:01.520 --> 50:05.520]  could get you on the radio here that I mean there is an impact market and a
[50:05.520 --> 50:10.200]  lot of folks here yeah no I know listen I hear you people always calling and say
[50:10.200 --> 50:13.560]  why aren't you on in this city why aren't you on that city how do we get you

[56:17.760 --> 56:23.440]  okay let's go ahead and go to Lauren in Ohio Lauren you're on the air go ahead
[56:23.440 --> 56:28.120]  hey Alex how are you doing good good to hear from you great um hey you were
[56:28.120 --> 56:31.680]  talking about I'll just a couple things and then I'll get to my main thing but
[56:31.680 --> 56:37.600]  baritimilitude the appearance of truth that's what we've been living under in
[56:37.600 --> 56:41.600]  this culture and that's why we're having so much trouble because we think things
[56:41.600 --> 56:45.960]  that are not real are real dominionomics men want control over other men
[56:45.960 --> 56:50.320]  that's how it's been since the very beginning it isn't going to change well
[56:50.320 --> 56:54.840]  you know what business do we have obeying men instead of obeying God well
[56:54.840 --> 56:58.880]  it's also a devilish system because if you're not a control freak and don't want
[56:58.880 --> 57:04.360]  to control other people you have to get power just to protect yourself and live
[57:04.360 --> 57:08.040]  in peace and that's what liberty is all about is having your own money your own
[57:08.040 --> 57:14.360]  liberties your own freedoms and having a mutual truce of not having aggression
[57:14.360 --> 57:18.760]  towards each other so that we can use our own resources instead of expending
[57:18.760 --> 57:22.680]  them fighting with each other and in your time it's like if somebody just kept
[57:22.680 --> 57:25.600]  coming up to your door every day saying you want me ten thousand dollars you
[57:25.600 --> 57:28.560]  want me to and you got to keep opening the door and saying no just the stealing
[57:28.560 --> 57:32.720]  of your time they're time pirates but here's the solution time pirates that's
[57:32.720 --> 57:41.280]  a great turn go ahead but so here's my solution though jobs hemp high
[57:41.280 --> 57:45.800]  employment manufacturing products they keep trying to have us living in an
[57:45.800 --> 57:50.840]  industry where there's no productivity if you look at where money is being made
[57:50.840 --> 57:54.440]  in this country none of it is producing products that's it they want a and I'm
[57:54.440 --> 57:58.880]  gonna keep you over this is key they want a zero economy one that's not just a
[57:58.880 --> 58:01.880]  zero growth that's what they publicly say more a strong and David Rockefeller
[58:01.880 --> 58:06.480]  say they want it reduced by at least 80% and that means getting rid of most of
[58:06.480 --> 58:11.920]  people though they know an industrialized nation actually causes that they just
[58:11.920 --> 58:14.880]  want the third world to actually starve to death so they actually want a larger
[58:14.880 --> 58:18.560]  population but then later just to call that larger mass stay there I want you
[58:18.560 --> 58:21.600]  to continue with the great line of reasoning you're putting out here
[58:21.600 --> 58:25.560]  Lauren we come back in T-minus 70 seconds and then eight minutes into the
[58:25.560 --> 58:28.920]  show we start the second segment we're gonna have Mike Rivera joining us for

[1:00:59.200 --> 1:01:03.640]  yes the establishment wants you to spend all your time filling out census forms
[1:01:03.640 --> 1:01:08.080]  and tax forms and they admit it's a tool of control because the globalist are
[1:01:08.080 --> 1:01:12.800]  monopoly men and they don't want a free market go ahead and so they have jobs
[1:01:12.800 --> 1:01:17.400]  managing your life now there's nothing you can sell for a buck there
[1:01:17.400 --> 1:01:20.680]  prison guards what are you what do you produce you can sell for a buck the
[1:01:20.680 --> 1:01:23.680]  prison blues and the deaths that you make in the prisons compete against the
[1:01:23.680 --> 1:01:27.880]  public sector that's trying to make a living but anyway yes it's a control
[1:01:27.880 --> 1:01:32.800]  freak the whole world is a giant control freak church where the control freaks
[1:01:32.800 --> 1:01:37.600]  set up control freak systems lesser men who are nothing but greedy wicked
[1:01:37.600 --> 1:01:41.840]  control freaks it's their system yes now here's the solution and we can just
[1:01:41.840 --> 1:01:45.200]  take it from them we don't have to vote for anybody we don't have to we can do
[1:01:45.200 --> 1:01:50.320]  this on our own here's the deal non-compliance just start saying no
[1:01:50.320 --> 1:01:56.200]  other crap it's respect for truth I'm looking at an 1888 campaign poster okay
[1:01:56.200 --> 1:02:02.280]  and what does it say protect rice corn hemp in fruit and the other thing it
[1:02:02.280 --> 1:02:07.160]  says this is 1888 an honest count and an honest vote in an honest count so we're
[1:02:07.160 --> 1:02:10.640]  dealing with the same problems but see back then they had respect for the truth
[1:02:10.640 --> 1:02:14.720]  God put rice on the planet he put corn he put fruit he put hemp it's the widest
[1:02:14.720 --> 1:02:19.240]  the most widely used fabric and material in the world but we're banned from
[1:02:19.240 --> 1:02:24.040]  that's right and 99% of the varieties have no THC but the police don't care
[1:02:24.040 --> 1:02:27.200]  they'll come to your house and swat Damian beat your brains out if you're
[1:02:27.200 --> 1:02:30.000]  caught with it because it makes it's better than cotton and you're not gonna
[1:02:30.000 --> 1:02:33.040]  grow it you're gonna wear toxic polyester and if you don't like it they'll
[1:02:33.040 --> 1:02:37.880]  murder you period and you could provide jobs from the farm all the way up through
[1:02:37.880 --> 1:02:42.280]  pole manufacturing Henry Ford had a car made completely a flax hemp and linen
[1:02:42.280 --> 1:02:47.120]  doesn't matter doesn't matter 1941 matter the chemical companies have SWAT
[1:02:47.120 --> 1:02:52.080]  teams they have SWAT teams we can make them do this just like we're making them
[1:02:52.080 --> 1:02:56.000]  we made them not let in all those illegals we made them you know in Ohio we
[1:02:56.000 --> 1:03:01.040]  made them not charge us to park in our state parks that we pay for we can make
[1:03:01.040 --> 1:03:05.240]  them do this and if we make them do this we've got everything you can provide
[1:03:05.240 --> 1:03:10.800]  food clothing shelter fuel you can provide biodegradable plastics steel 10
[1:03:10.800 --> 1:03:15.360]  times stronger than it's been feel it remember old iron sides the battleship
[1:03:15.360 --> 1:03:19.640]  they were tired last year there was 40,000 acres of hemp in there and so you
[1:03:19.640 --> 1:03:23.280]  have a government that made a video hemp for victory all patriotic farmers will
[1:03:23.280 --> 1:03:29.560]  grow this you see al-qaeda we can't keep letting them say that the truth is not
[1:03:29.560 --> 1:03:32.400]  the truth and we just go along are you kidding they're trying to they're
[1:03:32.400 --> 1:03:35.520]  trying to ma'am I I hear you and I appreciate your call they're trying to
[1:03:35.520 --> 1:03:39.400]  restrict made a lot of good points they're trying to restrict aloe vera
[1:03:39.400 --> 1:03:48.600]  now yes for some reason the ash that comes out of hemp that is confirmed
[1:03:48.600 --> 1:03:54.120]  when they burn it they create the ash or what they call the coke that they put
[1:03:54.120 --> 1:03:57.480]  into the furnaces with the iron to make the steel and yes it does it's just a
[1:03:57.480 --> 1:04:02.400]  amazing plant and very few varieties actually have THC but they don't care
[1:04:02.400 --> 1:04:07.040]  they the federal government the big foundations admittedly in the 20s and
[1:04:07.040 --> 1:04:13.960]  30s went around all the public schools and to the local school boards and the
[1:04:13.960 --> 1:04:19.320]  PTAs and said hemp is evil hemp is bad it makes you go crazy and they said
[1:04:19.320 --> 1:04:23.360]  ban it and they said absolutely ban it and so you can't grow it here in
[1:04:23.360 --> 1:04:26.200]  America but they can grow it in Canada and make tens of billions of dollars a
[1:04:26.200 --> 1:04:30.360]  year off of it and it's just another example of how they do whatever they
[1:04:30.360 --> 1:04:34.800]  want whenever they want because the government is run by absolute total
[1:04:34.800 --> 1:04:40.680]  degenerate criminals micro vero is coming up joining us from Hawaii hooked up

[1:05:02.080 --> 1:05:05.880]  reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator this summer number
[1:05:05.880 --> 1:05:09.400]  one new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill
[1:05:09.400 --> 1:05:14.080]  number two our new energies are wants to control how much power your electric
[1:05:14.080 --> 1:05:17.600]  company allows you to have it's true total government control of
[1:05:17.600 --> 1:05:21.400]  electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming number three in
[1:05:21.400 --> 1:05:25.240]  some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously overloaded especially
[1:05:25.240 --> 1:05:28.600]  with the high demand summer months ahead number four the hurricane and
[1:05:28.600 --> 1:05:32.160]  dangerous summer storm season is here again every year thousands of families
[1:05:32.160 --> 1:05:36.000]  lose their power from weather related outages number five a solar power
[1:05:36.000 --> 1:05:39.520]  generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind folks I

[1:09:02.840 --> 1:09:08.200]  guest on that's a good idea in Missouri with the hearings they've had on my
[1:09:08.200 --> 1:09:12.240]  act where the feds came in and we're teaching them that the founding fathers
[1:09:12.240 --> 1:09:16.200]  are bad actually a video that in Missouri the police being talked at by
[1:09:16.200 --> 1:09:20.800]  FEMA that the founders are bad America's bad I know this sounds crazy but this is
[1:09:20.800 --> 1:09:26.040]  really going on so that's coming up next hour but with us five minutes in the

[1:09:35.200 --> 1:09:39.680]  tv with a whole host of issues to talk about microvera good to have you here
[1:09:39.680 --> 1:09:44.000]  with us thank you for having me back on the show today it's always good to have
[1:09:44.000 --> 1:09:47.800]  you I want to take a lot of calls today when you're on with us but let's get
[1:09:47.800 --> 1:09:51.880]  into a host of subjects I want to get into bill would give president emergency
[1:09:51.880 --> 1:09:56.760]  control over the internet taking over all the private it a new private group
[1:09:56.760 --> 1:10:02.600]  of federally certified it commas ours to be over even private networks by law a
[1:10:02.600 --> 1:10:07.120]  form of indentured servitude converting the whole economy over I want to get
[1:10:07.120 --> 1:10:10.720]  into the latest flu developments they're now admitting quarantines force
[1:10:10.720 --> 1:10:13.640]  inoculations that doesn't mean they're gonna get away with it though it just
[1:10:13.640 --> 1:10:19.440]  means they're gonna try it obama's plunging approval numbers just all the
[1:10:19.440 --> 1:10:24.840]  things that are happening but Mike out of the gates I'm asking you this not
[1:10:24.840 --> 1:10:28.280]  having any idea what do you think's most important right now what is on
[1:10:28.280 --> 1:10:33.160]  micro vera's mind well I think the first topic you mentioned is definitely
[1:10:33.160 --> 1:10:37.040]  important we're seeing all this legislative push to give the government
[1:10:37.040 --> 1:10:41.800]  control of the internet in a so-called emergency we're also seeing where certain
[1:10:41.800 --> 1:10:45.760]  organizations like Wikipedia are now going to decide for you what is
[1:10:45.760 --> 1:10:49.200]  trustworthy and what is not they're gonna be little color codes we know
[1:10:49.200 --> 1:10:52.600]  there's a new web browser in development that will have built into it a
[1:10:52.600 --> 1:10:56.760]  little indicator on whether the link that is showing on your page should be
[1:10:56.760 --> 1:11:01.200]  considered trustworthy or not and this is a desperate panic attempt by the
[1:11:01.200 --> 1:11:05.440]  government and the corporate media to take us back to the 1950s and 1960s
[1:11:05.440 --> 1:11:09.880]  when we the American people would rely on government and the media to tell us
[1:11:09.880 --> 1:11:13.600]  what to think and what to believe in of course the whole point of the evolution
[1:11:13.600 --> 1:11:16.680]  of the internet and the blogs and the Alex Jones show and what really happened
[1:11:16.680 --> 1:11:20.520]  is that the American people are learning to trust their own analytical
[1:11:20.520 --> 1:11:26.000]  ability to decide what is true what is a lie what is false and the government is
[1:11:26.000 --> 1:11:30.200]  scared out of their minds about it the corporate media has lost control of the
[1:11:30.200 --> 1:11:34.400]  American public they're trying to figure some way they can convince you to give up
[1:11:34.400 --> 1:11:38.960]  trusting your own mind and go back to letting an authority figure tell you
[1:11:38.960 --> 1:11:43.160]  what is true and what is not true just last night we had another national
[1:11:43.160 --> 1:11:47.320]  geographic show out there trying to resell the idea that anybody who thinks
[1:11:47.320 --> 1:11:50.840]  there's a conspiracy about 9-11 there's just got to be something wrong about
[1:11:50.840 --> 1:11:54.160]  those people and you don't want to hang out with them and again it's the same
[1:11:54.160 --> 1:11:57.480]  stuff they have been hammering before they go right back to that no plane at
[1:11:57.480 --> 1:12:01.600]  the Pentagon thing and they use that as the primary lever to try and convince
[1:12:01.600 --> 1:12:05.320]  people that there couldn't possibly be anything incorrect about the official
[1:12:05.320 --> 1:12:09.040]  government story of 9-11 they've lost control of the American people that's
[1:12:09.040 --> 1:12:12.720]  why we're seeing this anger surface in the town hall meetings the the the
[1:12:12.720 --> 1:12:17.640]  healthcare reform is just the fuse the powder for the anger is being lied into
[1:12:17.640 --> 1:12:22.520]  war after war after war being lied to about 9-11 being lied to about TWA
[1:12:22.520 --> 1:12:27.320]  800 being lied to about Pearl Harbor torture all of it is building to a head
[1:12:27.320 --> 1:12:31.080]  right now the government knows they can't lie to us anymore with any kind of
[1:12:31.080 --> 1:12:35.760]  success they're desperate to figure out a way to reimpose that rule by lie and
[1:12:35.760 --> 1:12:40.400]  they're like and Mike you're right that before you leave I do want to talk
[1:12:40.400 --> 1:12:43.720]  some about the National Geographic show I did watch part of it last night they
[1:12:43.720 --> 1:12:50.760]  fired a missile with a pound of explosive into a chicken coop a fiberglass
[1:12:50.760 --> 1:12:55.560]  chicken coop and it blows up and they say see explosives would have blown up the
[1:12:55.560 --> 1:13:01.400]  whole Pentagon I mean that was insane the other parts I saw were insane they
[1:13:01.400 --> 1:13:04.880]  used a few clips of the quote truthers and they would put the name truth or
[1:13:04.880 --> 1:13:09.520]  all crooked down at the bottom like it was all disjointed just the way they
[1:13:09.520 --> 1:13:13.680]  shot it the way they did it the way they zoom in on a band-aid on Richard Gage's
[1:13:13.680 --> 1:13:18.160]  show or zoom in on Dylan Avery picking his mustache or whatever I mean just
[1:13:18.160 --> 1:13:22.120]  everything because I've had that before I mean I've had national media following
[1:13:22.120 --> 1:13:25.960]  around for two three days and the one time I wipe my nose I see him looking at
[1:13:25.960 --> 1:13:30.640]  me I go that's gonna be on TV you know they use every little slip-up and they
[1:13:30.640 --> 1:13:34.240]  do everything they can just this image and the camera kind of crooked when
[1:13:34.240 --> 1:13:37.720]  they're talking to you but when they talk to the debunker it's all crystal
[1:13:37.720 --> 1:13:42.280]  clear I mean they do this over and over again so I want to go over that today
[1:13:42.280 --> 1:13:49.160]  coming up Mike but but first the power to create a national no fly list we
[1:13:49.160 --> 1:13:53.800]  always said would be used to create a no gun by list it's Kafka ask you're not
[1:13:53.800 --> 1:13:57.080]  arrested you're not charged you can't find out who puts you on the list you
[1:13:57.080 --> 1:14:02.200]  can't get off the list now you can't have a job you can't get on a bus go to
[1:14:02.200 --> 1:14:07.520]  national parks you can't get on a plane you can't own a firearm if you're on
[1:14:07.520 --> 1:14:11.920]  that list and they now admit they've got over a million two hundred thousand and
[1:14:11.920 --> 1:14:15.040]  the last eight months they made the list secret so it's probably a million
[1:14:15.040 --> 1:14:19.040]  a half by now they admit they say the government and other corporations are
[1:14:19.040 --> 1:14:26.600]  working on these list where they'll say your website is not true well creating a
[1:14:26.600 --> 1:14:31.480]  list that tracks what people are saying and doing and where things are flagged
[1:14:31.480 --> 1:14:37.400]  and we know Wikipedia was the model of that where my name is spelled wrong most
[1:14:37.400 --> 1:14:42.040]  the stuff on there is a lie they won't even let me change it or anybody else
[1:14:42.040 --> 1:14:46.520]  change it I've sent them mainstream news articles showing what I'm saying is true
[1:14:46.520 --> 1:14:53.200]  and they don't care now this CIA admittedly runs Wikipedia model is now
[1:14:53.200 --> 1:14:57.080]  gonna be the whole internet where they take control they place things over your
[1:14:57.080 --> 1:15:02.000]  computer screen and that's only phase one the power to track internet is the
[1:15:02.000 --> 1:15:05.920]  power to then block you go under those sites and the Pentagon's on record under
[1:15:05.920 --> 1:15:11.400]  the cyber security act not just in the bill which a Rockefeller but in for
[1:15:11.400 --> 1:15:14.400]  those that don't know in the actual cyber security announcements and
[1:15:14.400 --> 1:15:19.080]  symposiums that we've posted the links to the video they brag that they're gonna
[1:15:19.080 --> 1:15:23.320]  quote shut down opposition to the government in the US by just shutting
[1:15:23.320 --> 1:15:29.720]  off IPs and already jonesreport.com info wars.com prisonplanet.com you can't go
[1:15:29.720 --> 1:15:34.040]  to them at most libraries and we've gotten the screenshots it says this is a
[1:15:34.040 --> 1:15:39.920]  site that teaches you criminal skills or hacking or racism and they're banning
[1:15:39.920 --> 1:15:44.120]  our YouTube videos saying racism when it's not even about race so we can see
[1:15:44.120 --> 1:15:48.440]  the new tyranny Mike Rivera will break it down you're absolutely correct here my
[1:15:48.440 --> 1:15:51.640]  own experience with Wikipedia they used to have articles about what really
[1:15:51.640 --> 1:15:55.360]  happened.com they had an article about me personally it was filled with a lot
[1:15:55.360 --> 1:15:59.880]  of distortions I went into correct it I'd go back the original lies were back
[1:15:59.880 --> 1:16:04.000]  in I'd go in and correct it again they put the lies back in I'd go back into
[1:16:04.000 --> 1:16:07.640]  correct it it was locked against editing and I would I'm not kidding you
[1:16:07.640 --> 1:16:11.520]  Wikipedia told me that I was not allowed to change the article about Michael
[1:16:11.520 --> 1:16:15.440]  Rivera because I was not a recognized authority on the subject of Michael
[1:16:15.440 --> 1:16:19.920]  Rivera when I wrote back and I said I am Michael Rivera they simply deleted the
[1:16:19.920 --> 1:16:23.400]  articles and you're absolutely right they're trying to block websites if you
[1:16:23.400 --> 1:16:28.640]  go to a US military base the the computer security there it is insane in
[1:16:28.640 --> 1:16:32.600]  fact the the computer security on military basis is so tight the
[1:16:32.600 --> 1:16:36.560]  computers are all but unusable and definitely you are not allowed to see
[1:16:36.560 --> 1:16:39.480]  any Alex Jones site you're not allowed to see what really happened they are
[1:16:39.480 --> 1:16:43.760]  terrified the word is getting out there and yes they're openly talking about
[1:16:43.760 --> 1:16:47.960]  finding some way to take the truth away from the people to forces to go back to
[1:16:47.960 --> 1:16:51.440]  living in a culture of lies and deception because that is the only way
[1:16:51.440 --> 1:16:56.400]  they know how to rule us and you know the thing with the no-fly list turning
[1:16:56.400 --> 1:17:00.440]  into a no-gun list turning into no job list this is the government using
[1:17:00.440 --> 1:17:04.360]  terror on the American people because you're terrified if you get on that
[1:17:04.360 --> 1:17:08.600]  list your life is functionally over you can't work you can't travel you can't
[1:17:08.600 --> 1:17:13.120]  have a normal life this is just like they used to do in Stalin's Russia in the
[1:17:13.120 --> 1:17:16.840]  Soviet Union if you got on the bad enemies list the government would
[1:17:16.840 --> 1:17:20.320]  destroy your life with impunity and everybody around would say oh he's on
[1:17:20.320 --> 1:17:24.080]  the list he must be a bad person now of course we recognize that that was
[1:17:24.080 --> 1:17:27.440]  definitely not the case we know in our own past history in the United States
[1:17:27.440 --> 1:17:32.240]  that the black list were very often in fact usually tools of intimidation and
[1:17:32.240 --> 1:17:36.080]  persecution and this is a hundred times a hundred times bigger and worse than the
[1:17:36.080 --> 1:17:41.680]  black list they're admitting it's gonna be a no job no travel no gun list with
[1:17:41.680 --> 1:17:48.000]  no judge jury no evidence so we're now being given the choice liberty or
[1:17:48.000 --> 1:17:53.080]  slavery freedom or tyranny if we are cowed if we let the chilling effect
[1:17:53.080 --> 1:17:58.800]  work and start self-censoring they will win but if we say look you can't pull us
[1:17:58.800 --> 1:18:04.160]  all on list you bastards they lose here's an example Mike three weeks ago a
[1:18:04.160 --> 1:18:09.520]  young man junior in high school put up several hundred posters in Florida they
[1:18:09.520 --> 1:18:13.560]  came the state Attorney General said they may arrest him when that happened
[1:18:13.560 --> 1:18:18.240]  everybody statewide every major town it was all over the news put up the Joker
[1:18:18.240 --> 1:18:23.720]  info wars.com poster then it spread all over the world that intimidation made it
[1:18:23.720 --> 1:18:27.680]  blow up a hundred times a hundred and so now they're dropping charges backing off
[1:18:27.680 --> 1:18:31.560]  saying it's okay it's okay the Washington Post came out and said don't
[1:18:31.560 --> 1:18:36.800]  censor it don't censor it free speech because the tyrants know we are going
[1:18:36.800 --> 1:18:40.560]  to win that's why I've said I want to live I don't want to die but if they
[1:18:40.560 --> 1:18:45.360]  kill me or set me up I'm doing it for my family I'm doing it for humanity I have
[1:18:45.360 --> 1:18:49.760]  just become a giant fertilizer bag to the mighty oak of liberty and if you have
[1:18:49.760 --> 1:18:55.200]  that attitude of I'm gonna fight you 110% you can't be beaten Mike they can
[1:18:55.200 --> 1:19:00.080]  beat us individually like V for Vendetta ideas though are bulletproof and I just
[1:19:00.080 --> 1:19:03.640]  thank God I know people like you Mike and I thank God we're part of the 21st
[1:19:03.640 --> 1:19:09.720]  century 1776. Well my personal opinion is that the US government is going to go
[1:19:09.720 --> 1:19:13.800]  the way of the former Soviet Union it is on the verge of collapse economically it
[1:19:13.800 --> 1:19:17.680]  has lost the trust of the American people it literally cannot function
[1:19:17.680 --> 1:19:21.440]  because the only way it could control the American people was to lie we now
[1:19:21.440 --> 1:19:25.560]  know about the lies we're not going to go back to being led by lies willingly
[1:19:25.560 --> 1:19:30.200]  and as a result I'm convinced this government is doomed and there is no
[1:19:30.200 --> 1:19:34.440]  way to save it and there we're seeing a lot of panic on their on their on their
[1:19:34.440 --> 1:19:38.280]  part right now but in the end I think it is going to collapse and we're at the
[1:19:38.280 --> 1:19:41.120]  point where we have to start thinking what do we want to bring on to replace
[1:19:41.120 --> 1:19:45.600]  it all right by the way provocateurs and in the fed rally article is up I'm

[1:24:07.440 --> 1:24:17.840]  information war continues it's alex jones and the GCN radio network
[1:24:17.840 --> 1:24:20.560]  all right mike i want to start going to calls the next segment then get into the
[1:24:20.560 --> 1:24:24.320]  whole 9-11 situation coming up with you maybe a little bit in the next hour but
[1:24:24.320 --> 1:24:27.120]  i gotta get into this overall militia demonization
[1:24:27.120 --> 1:24:32.320]  that's going on speaking of that it's come out in state testimony and i've
[1:24:32.320 --> 1:24:35.760]  talked to people involved at the state hearing we're working on getting some
[1:24:35.760 --> 1:24:38.720]  of them on the next few days including state representatives
[1:24:38.720 --> 1:24:43.040]  and and and state police were censured did get in trouble
[1:24:43.040 --> 1:24:46.960]  by the state attorney general over this
[1:24:47.040 --> 1:24:50.560]  and the deputy lieutenant governor also exposed what was happening but it
[1:24:50.560 --> 1:24:54.080]  turns out you look at these guys classic MO
[1:24:54.080 --> 1:24:56.960]  their cops they're wearing these yellow bands
[1:24:56.960 --> 1:25:00.960]  they're wearing the same outfits they have the cop build but the state's also
[1:25:00.960 --> 1:25:04.640]  reporting that they were there saying let's do illegal things let's attack
[1:25:04.640 --> 1:25:08.080]  and we said this in denver we said this in auto well we've been right every time
[1:25:08.080 --> 1:25:11.680]  when you look at them you can instantly tell a cop you know they they normally
[1:25:11.680 --> 1:25:14.800]  only put cops they think and take care of themselves in these situations
[1:25:14.800 --> 1:25:20.640]  they're normally about six two to six five big arms it's the steroid type cops
[1:25:20.640 --> 1:25:24.480]  the intelligence units these are probably feds a lot of times they command
[1:25:24.480 --> 1:25:29.360]  squads though of meth heads that are under them the
[1:25:29.360 --> 1:25:32.800]  local foundation drug addicts and they've been caught
[1:25:32.800 --> 1:25:36.000]  and they have anarchist sites that attack me we know they're feds as well
[1:25:36.000 --> 1:25:40.480]  they've been caught getting federal money but but the state's reporting they
[1:25:40.480 --> 1:25:43.360]  think this was provocative I agree looking at them
[1:25:43.360 --> 1:25:46.560]  we'll put the image up on screen it's up on prisonplanet.com
[1:25:46.560 --> 1:25:50.720]  provocative it in the fed rally these are cops bottom line I can I can look at
[1:25:50.720 --> 1:25:54.960]  you I can tell you these are cops go ahead Mike Rivera
[1:25:54.960 --> 1:25:58.800]  well first of all I want to start off by saying that I know everyone talks about
[1:25:58.800 --> 1:26:01.760]  revolution and guns and militias and the rest of it
[1:26:01.760 --> 1:26:05.040]  but the reality is this revolution is already underway and it's going to be
[1:26:05.040 --> 1:26:08.320]  one with keyboards not with firearms it's going to be one with microphones
[1:26:08.320 --> 1:26:12.160]  it's going to be one with computers and so forth and so on but the government
[1:26:12.160 --> 1:26:16.320]  is desperate to recast the image of the opposition
[1:26:16.320 --> 1:26:20.880]  into that of a villain because it all comes down to public support
[1:26:20.880 --> 1:26:23.840]  the side with the most public support is going to win
[1:26:23.840 --> 1:26:27.120]  when the founding fathers wanted to start a new nation and kick the old
[1:26:27.120 --> 1:26:31.200]  government out they needed support of the general public so those of us who
[1:26:31.200 --> 1:26:33.200]  want to affect change in this country
[1:26:33.200 --> 1:26:36.480]  we need the support of the general public we need them out there marching
[1:26:36.480 --> 1:26:39.360]  with us protesting with us signing petitions with us
[1:26:39.360 --> 1:26:43.200]  urging change what the government wants to do is put out a bunch of these
[1:26:43.200 --> 1:26:46.560]  agent provocateurs to pretend to be part of our group
[1:26:46.560 --> 1:26:49.840]  and then behave in a way that will destroy public sympathy for us
[1:26:49.840 --> 1:26:53.200]  I think the classic example of that happened back in the
[1:26:53.200 --> 1:26:57.920]  Vietnam War where the FBI operating under orders from the Nixon White House
[1:26:57.920 --> 1:27:01.440]  used their undercover college informants and they're still on there today any
[1:27:01.440 --> 1:27:04.080]  students listening to this show you need to be aware of that
[1:27:04.080 --> 1:27:07.760]  and they use their undercover college informants to organize a multi-campus
[1:27:07.760 --> 1:27:11.120]  anti-war demonstration in front of the disneyland theme park in
[1:27:11.120 --> 1:27:14.720]  anaheim california once they were there the undercover
[1:27:14.720 --> 1:27:18.480]  agents provocateurs led the protest inside the park and started
[1:27:18.480 --> 1:27:21.600]  causing a lot of property damage the newspaper photos show
[1:27:21.600 --> 1:27:25.440]  photographers showed up took pictures the national guard showed up the next day
[1:27:25.440 --> 1:27:29.840]  it was on every newspaper in america and in that one headline
[1:27:29.840 --> 1:27:33.360]  of those so-called peace activists beating up on mickey mouse
[1:27:33.360 --> 1:27:37.120]  they completely discredited the anti-war movement which allowed the vietnam war
[1:27:37.120 --> 1:27:40.960]  to continue for another two years and then later came out in the senator
[1:27:40.960 --> 1:27:45.360]  church committee this is all confirmed that they did this and now it's coming
[1:27:45.360 --> 1:27:48.960]  out we fingered years ago howl turner is FBI
[1:27:48.960 --> 1:27:53.440]  then now it's admitted he is yeah they're using that as his defense in court
[1:27:53.440 --> 1:27:56.320]  that he was only doing what the federal government told him to do
[1:27:56.320 --> 1:28:00.480]  i mean the government survives by creating the very enemies were supposed
[1:28:00.480 --> 1:28:03.520]  to be afraid of the sim b&e's liberation army
[1:28:03.520 --> 1:28:07.280]  was manufactured by the fbi they kidnapped petty hearst to guarantee
[1:28:07.280 --> 1:28:10.240]  themselves newspaper coverage and that and by the way
[1:28:10.240 --> 1:28:13.920]  that's now been declassified that it was all staged with her
[1:28:13.920 --> 1:28:17.600]  stage with the hearst family that's popular mechanics
[1:28:17.600 --> 1:28:21.440]  you know the the father of yellow journalism all staged
[1:28:21.440 --> 1:28:25.520]  all staged and now we've got the british
[1:28:25.520 --> 1:28:29.600]  secret service has declassified documents the whole hijacking that led to the
[1:28:29.600 --> 1:28:34.400]  radon and tebby was also staged it was done to destroy popular support for the
[1:28:34.400 --> 1:28:36.880]  palestinians who had nothing to do with it
[1:28:36.880 --> 1:28:40.160]  and so when you're out there and you're seeing these groups that are saying
[1:28:40.160 --> 1:28:43.040]  we're opposed to the government and they're acting in a way
[1:28:43.040 --> 1:28:47.680]  to that is just going to scare you they're probably government plants
[1:28:47.680 --> 1:28:50.720]  because that is the only way the government can destroy sympathy for
[1:28:50.720 --> 1:28:53.840]  those of us who want to restore this country to the freedoms that we used
[1:28:53.840 --> 1:28:56.400]  to have they're out there trying to convince you
[1:28:56.400 --> 1:28:59.760]  that terrorism which is made by the government is the justification to
[1:28:59.760 --> 1:29:03.040]  surrender your personal freedoms and rights that's all they can think of
[1:29:03.040 --> 1:29:05.360]  selling you because as long as you have freedom of
[1:29:05.360 --> 1:29:08.560]  speech and you have the freedom to go out on the neck and find information for
[1:29:08.560 --> 1:29:11.760]  yourself the government is doomed because they've survived so
[1:29:11.760 --> 1:29:14.320]  long on lies they don't have anything else to hold them up
[1:29:14.320 --> 1:29:18.480]  well my pure right this is a two plus two equals four equation
[1:29:18.480 --> 1:29:23.360]  if the whole economy is being converted to police and military and anti-terror
[1:29:23.360 --> 1:29:26.240]  and private groups are making all the money off of it
[1:29:26.240 --> 1:29:31.040]  uh who stands to gain to have terrorism kibono who benefits motive and then you
[1:29:31.040 --> 1:29:35.360]  go look at the evidence it's them and so they're gonna stage attacks they're
[1:29:35.360 --> 1:29:38.000]  gonna shoot people they're gonna do all this they're
[1:29:38.000 --> 1:29:42.080]  gonna do another oklahoma city i see that in the cards unless we get the word
[1:29:42.080 --> 1:29:45.520]  out but even if they do it we just expose that event
[1:29:45.520 --> 1:29:51.040]  they want it to be violent that tells you you shouldn't be violent
[1:29:51.040 --> 1:29:54.880]  we're on the march the empire's on the run

[1:35:34.240 --> 1:35:36.560]  here it is
[1:35:36.560 --> 1:35:44.800]  the elites have said that they want to have a
[1:35:44.800 --> 1:35:48.960]  final revolution that they know the public's going to revolt against them
[1:35:48.960 --> 1:35:52.240]  so that's why they've scientifically set up the surveillance grid
[1:35:52.240 --> 1:35:56.000]  the casual society this whole continuity of government system
[1:35:56.000 --> 1:36:02.880]  is designed to suppress and control the people of america
[1:36:02.880 --> 1:36:11.040]  my name is samozaki i'm a native born american citizen los angeles california
[1:36:11.040 --> 1:36:17.280]  when franklin delano rosevelt signed executive order 9066 we were all
[1:36:17.280 --> 1:36:22.960]  rounded up like cattle and placed into america's concentration camps
[1:36:22.960 --> 1:36:28.400]  in may 2007 president bush signed a national security presidential directive 51
[1:36:28.400 --> 1:36:32.400]  most americans would agree that it would be prudent
[1:36:32.400 --> 1:36:35.360]  to have a plan to provide for the continuity of government
[1:36:35.360 --> 1:36:40.240]  they have such a plan they introduced a little sketchy public version that's
[1:36:40.240 --> 1:36:44.240]  clearly inadequate but they said don't worry there's a detailed classified
[1:36:44.240 --> 1:36:53.840]  version army regulation 210-35 now this was set up in 1986 secretly
[1:36:53.840 --> 1:37:01.840]  and for 10 plus years it was secret and in 1997 bill clinton declassified this
[1:37:01.840 --> 1:37:04.960]  and we were the first major radio show to come
[1:37:04.960 --> 1:37:12.720]  since then it's been expanded this list 12 camps to hold american citizens
[1:37:12.720 --> 1:37:16.320]  that have been built by the united states
[1:37:16.320 --> 1:37:21.120]  army beginning in october the army plans to
[1:37:21.120 --> 1:37:24.560]  station an active unit inside the united states
[1:37:24.560 --> 1:37:28.480]  under north kong and under the new homeland brigade
[1:37:28.480 --> 1:37:32.720]  it was first going to be 3 000 and then 20 000 and then 40 000
[1:37:32.720 --> 1:37:36.800]  the third infantry divisions first brigade combat team has spent 35 of
[1:37:36.800 --> 1:37:40.960]  last 60 months in iraq combat hardened troops who've been
[1:37:40.960 --> 1:37:45.680]  running camps and centers in iraq are now coming back to the united
[1:37:45.680 --> 1:37:48.960]  states to quote carry out law enforcement actions
[1:37:48.960 --> 1:37:54.240]  army unit may be called upon to help with civil unrest and crowd control
[1:37:54.240 --> 1:37:58.800]  the primary purposes for us to provide help we've uh
[1:37:58.800 --> 1:38:02.240]  we've got the rest of the trailer up on info wars dot com if you want to go
[1:38:02.240 --> 1:38:04.880]  you'll see i don't want to go back to mike revero but
[1:38:04.880 --> 1:38:08.640]  mike i mean we understand they're hiring provocateurs we understand they're
[1:38:08.640 --> 1:38:12.000]  hiring white supremacists we understand they're doing all this
[1:38:12.000 --> 1:38:15.840]  ford foundation funds la raza that means for our race everything for those
[1:38:15.840 --> 1:38:19.920]  outside our race nothing they had the former austin mayor when he was mayor
[1:38:19.920 --> 1:38:23.760]  get up and give a proclamation that hispanics are the master race
[1:38:23.760 --> 1:38:28.160]  i mean i have the video of this it's insane uh so they want us all fighting
[1:38:28.160 --> 1:38:31.440]  with each other and they're just gonna i guess
[1:38:31.440 --> 1:38:36.800]  continue to do it i think the key here is we need citizens
[1:38:36.800 --> 1:38:40.160]  to go stake out these protestant in the fed events
[1:38:40.160 --> 1:38:45.040]  and follow the troublemakers home and put them under full surveillance and
[1:38:45.040 --> 1:38:48.640]  shoot video of them and show that their cops or that their informants and
[1:38:48.640 --> 1:38:52.320]  follow them to the police station follow them when they meet their handler
[1:38:52.320 --> 1:38:55.280]  and then put it up on youtube do a report and then
[1:38:55.280 --> 1:38:59.120]  i we need to start arresting these people i mean don't the denver cops that
[1:38:59.120 --> 1:39:02.560]  attack the other denver cops to try to blame it on the protesters last year
[1:39:02.560 --> 1:39:06.320]  denver post admits the police admit i mean shouldn't they go to jail
[1:39:06.320 --> 1:39:11.120]  shouldn't all these cops that do this go to jail mike they they don't seem to i
[1:39:11.120 --> 1:39:14.160]  mean we see cops committing these kind of provocations and
[1:39:14.160 --> 1:39:17.280]  somebody says oh this is for the good of the nation and national security and
[1:39:17.280 --> 1:39:20.400]  it serves a higher purpose and all of a sudden the court system turns a blind
[1:39:20.400 --> 1:39:23.200]  eye uh you know i think anybody who still
[1:39:23.200 --> 1:39:26.960]  expects a fair administration of justice from the american
[1:39:26.960 --> 1:39:30.880]  legal system is living in a dream world because the american legal system is to
[1:39:30.880 --> 1:39:35.200]  basically keep the people down to extract wealth from them to justify
[1:39:35.200 --> 1:39:38.640]  corporate theft and government persecution and anybody who commits a
[1:39:38.640 --> 1:39:42.480]  crime in the name of the government uh basically they're allowed to get away
[1:39:42.480 --> 1:39:45.440]  with it i mean look at the free pass that's been given to all the people who
[1:39:45.440 --> 1:39:48.960]  were carrying out torture and other war crimes in iraq
[1:39:48.960 --> 1:39:51.440]  and nothing's going to happen to them it's very obvious they're going to be
[1:39:51.440 --> 1:39:53.600]  protected we've got dick cheney out there saying
[1:39:53.600 --> 1:39:56.560]  yeah we were out there doing all this stuff what are you going to do about it
[1:39:56.560 --> 1:40:00.720]  and that really is their attitude and you're absolutely correct right now the
[1:40:00.720 --> 1:40:04.720]  government is trying to create the illusion that those of us who want
[1:40:04.720 --> 1:40:08.640]  freedom are the bad guys that there's something wrong with us
[1:40:08.640 --> 1:40:13.040]  that we don't trust big daddy government to look after our every single
[1:40:13.040 --> 1:40:18.320]  uh you know need and uh and want and no we don't want that from the government
[1:40:18.320 --> 1:40:21.280]  i want to be left alone i want the government to go away and bother somebody
[1:40:21.280 --> 1:40:23.680]  else and just leave me alone to live out my life
[1:40:23.680 --> 1:40:27.520]  in peace and we can't seem to get that government
[1:40:27.520 --> 1:40:31.920]  seems to view it as its holy mission handed down from whatever gods are up
[1:40:31.920 --> 1:40:34.320]  there in in the sky or under the ground
[1:40:34.320 --> 1:40:38.480]  that they're supposed to always expand and manage more and more of your life
[1:40:38.480 --> 1:40:42.000]  and that is really the danger government never stops growing
[1:40:42.000 --> 1:40:45.840]  there's always an unending supply of nieces and nephews who need a job
[1:40:45.840 --> 1:40:49.600]  and so government will invent one more regulatory compliance
[1:40:49.600 --> 1:40:53.120]  that we're all until everything collapses and then they will literally put us
[1:40:53.120 --> 1:40:57.040]  in slave camps absolutely i was watching a show about
[1:40:57.040 --> 1:41:01.040]  russia last night where the the the surf system
[1:41:01.040 --> 1:41:04.640]  was literally created by imperial decree to
[1:41:04.640 --> 1:41:08.480]  counter the fact that peasants were starting to leave the lands held by the
[1:41:08.480 --> 1:41:11.280]  nobles and go to cities try and find jobs and
[1:41:11.280 --> 1:41:15.120]  and try and improve their life how dare the the serfs improve their lives we're
[1:41:15.120 --> 1:41:18.080]  going to lock them on the land they become the property of the of the
[1:41:18.080 --> 1:41:21.040]  nobility and that created the surf system in russia which of
[1:41:21.040 --> 1:41:24.880]  course ultimately led to the the communist revolution and by the way
[1:41:24.880 --> 1:41:28.560]  and the bankers knew the the serfs were going to rebel so they created a false
[1:41:28.560 --> 1:41:32.720]  vow that's all been declassified admitted as well that bank of england
[1:41:32.720 --> 1:41:37.600]  jp morgan chase goldman sacks same companies all funded the bolsheviks
[1:41:37.600 --> 1:41:42.000]  it was just a takeover from one group of thugs to another the british cousins
[1:41:42.000 --> 1:41:45.600]  knocked off their cousins when you read the club of rome david rockefeller
[1:41:45.600 --> 1:41:49.920]  their own books like the memoir he wrote in 2004 they admit
[1:41:49.920 --> 1:41:54.320]  they want in their own words a neo feudal surf system
[1:41:54.320 --> 1:41:58.000]  that's what they want and they're going to license how many kids we have and
[1:41:58.000 --> 1:42:02.640]  having these these people are sick and until people start saying no it's only
[1:42:02.640 --> 1:42:06.320]  going to get worse well the problem with people who
[1:42:06.320 --> 1:42:10.800]  feel that there should be leaders in the world as they often see themselves as
[1:42:10.800 --> 1:42:13.840]  the leaders and inevitably they think they should
[1:42:13.840 --> 1:42:17.040]  be in charge of absolutely everything because they know better
[1:42:17.040 --> 1:42:19.920]  the people who aspire to high positions of power
[1:42:19.920 --> 1:42:23.760]  will justify their criminal actions and their abuse of people
[1:42:23.760 --> 1:42:27.440]  by saying it serves a higher and nobler purpose which is embodied
[1:42:27.440 --> 1:42:31.680]  through them that ultimately they are the hope for a better world of tomorrow i
[1:42:31.680 --> 1:42:34.880]  mean even adolf hitler thought that so did stalin
[1:42:34.880 --> 1:42:39.200]  so did alexander the great obviously they were wrong but you can't convince
[1:42:39.200 --> 1:42:42.800]  them of that with facts logic and law it has to finally be settled
[1:42:42.800 --> 1:42:46.800]  with a crash of whatever the ruling body is and then they say well maybe that
[1:42:46.800 --> 1:42:49.120]  wasn't the best way to do it the problem is
[1:42:49.120 --> 1:42:53.440]  those self-elected rulers of the world every time there's a new revolution and
[1:42:53.440 --> 1:42:56.640]  a new change in history they say okay we won't make that
[1:42:56.640 --> 1:43:00.080]  mistake again so they're always learning i mean for 2000 years
[1:43:00.080 --> 1:43:04.560]  they have been developing the skills and means to control the population
[1:43:04.560 --> 1:43:08.640]  the arrival of the internet completely derailed all of that that's why you've
[1:43:08.640 --> 1:43:11.920]  got j rockefeller out there saying he wish it had never been invented
[1:43:11.920 --> 1:43:15.280]  because they had gotten used to being able to use the corporate media
[1:43:15.280 --> 1:43:17.920]  to lie us into whatever direction they wanted to go
[1:43:17.920 --> 1:43:21.520]  we need to invade iraq we'll tell them about weapons of mass destruction
[1:43:21.520 --> 1:43:24.960]  we need to invade these people we'll tell them about biological weapons we need
[1:43:24.960 --> 1:43:28.320]  to invade these people over here we'll do a concocted story about stolen
[1:43:28.320 --> 1:43:31.920]  incubators and dead premature babies they were used to doing that because
[1:43:31.920 --> 1:43:36.080]  during the 1950s and 60s it worked we believed everything the corporate
[1:43:36.080 --> 1:43:39.760]  media and government told us about those gosh darn commies
[1:43:39.760 --> 1:43:43.200]  and we fell for it and we paid trillions of dollars
[1:43:43.200 --> 1:43:47.200]  for the world's largest nuclear arsenal for the only country on earth to
[1:43:47.200 --> 1:43:49.520]  actually use nuclear weapons on another country
[1:43:49.520 --> 1:43:52.640]  the united states of america and meanwhile it turned out
[1:43:52.640 --> 1:43:56.800]  that the whole time the big industries here were supplying the russians
[1:43:56.800 --> 1:44:02.000]  with everything the whole lindley's program the whole weaponized program it
[1:44:02.000 --> 1:44:06.960]  it never ended the ford and chevy trucks were being shipped over
[1:44:06.960 --> 1:44:11.040]  to then be shipped to vietnam to fight because the globalists made money on
[1:44:11.040 --> 1:44:15.600]  both ends and the sooner we realize that paradigm
[1:44:15.600 --> 1:44:19.040]  the better it'll be for all of us i i want to go to some calls because i want
[1:44:19.040 --> 1:44:22.080]  to spend some time getting into the whole 9-11 hit piece
[1:44:22.080 --> 1:44:25.680]  last night because i take it mike you saw the whole thing
[1:44:25.680 --> 1:44:29.120]  i saw part of it i kind of got sick of it partway through and change channels
[1:44:29.120 --> 1:44:32.240]  yeah yeah i couldn't watch it i mean i mean i literally saw him shoot a
[1:44:32.240 --> 1:44:37.040]  missile into a chicken coop i mean it was a fiberglass chicken coop that thick
[1:44:37.040 --> 1:44:40.720]  and they put then and then they put a pound of plastic explosive in the
[1:44:40.720 --> 1:44:44.000]  chicken coop and blow it up and say see a missile
[1:44:44.000 --> 1:44:47.600]  would have blown the whole pentagon up i mean regardless what you think about
[1:44:47.600 --> 1:44:53.840]  the pentagon i mean this debunking is now i mean i've seen
[1:44:53.840 --> 1:44:57.600]  thermite reactions on tv were a cup of real thermite
[1:44:57.600 --> 1:45:01.120]  eats straight through a big block engine
[1:45:01.120 --> 1:45:04.960]  they supposedly put hundreds of pounds of thermite around a column
[1:45:04.960 --> 1:45:11.520]  set it on fire and nothing happens total crap i mean just just just in in
[1:45:11.520 --> 1:45:14.320]  fact we can make the video i don't have the time i'm busy
[1:45:14.320 --> 1:45:17.760]  doing all this other stuff but it's all over therm in fact google
[1:45:17.760 --> 1:45:21.680]  thermite reaction on youtube just a search engine the term thermite
[1:45:21.680 --> 1:45:25.680]  thermite on engine a small cup of it on engine
[1:45:25.680 --> 1:45:29.840]  eats through the whole engine in seconds but then you look at
[1:45:29.840 --> 1:45:33.200]  you look at this show they dump giant amount but they admit it's thermite
[1:45:33.200 --> 1:45:37.680]  they made they made so they made some fake thermite
[1:45:37.680 --> 1:45:42.400]  i mean these shows are just they're blowing up chicken coops now mike
[1:45:42.400 --> 1:45:45.920]  well one of the ones that i did see is they went in and they did a control
[1:45:45.920 --> 1:45:48.800]  demolition on a building and then they walk back through and they said see if
[1:45:48.800 --> 1:45:52.000]  there'd been a control demolition we would see all this pieces of
[1:45:52.000 --> 1:45:56.480]  debt cord all over the place and that's utter nonsense because debt cord
[1:45:56.480 --> 1:45:59.680]  when it fires off it completely consumes itself
[1:45:59.680 --> 1:46:03.120]  and there's these scraps of unused debt cord in the ruins of this building and
[1:46:03.120 --> 1:46:06.000]  they're saying see this proves there couldn't have been a control demolition
[1:46:06.000 --> 1:46:10.160]  it was an expression of panic it was an expression of panic i don't think it
[1:46:10.160 --> 1:46:14.080]  convinced anybody in fact they were so obvious and heavy handed about the
[1:46:14.080 --> 1:46:17.280]  cover-up i think if anything it's probably convinced a lot more people
[1:46:17.280 --> 1:46:21.200]  that something is like don't tell them like mike we want them to continue the
[1:46:21.200 --> 1:46:24.560]  hit pieces please don't let them in on the secret but this is only helping us
[1:46:24.560 --> 1:46:27.920]  wake everybody up i know i was watching it and i was like
[1:46:27.920 --> 1:46:31.440]  is this a joke and that woman's voice and she would go
[1:46:31.440 --> 1:46:35.920]  the truth there's literally that truth there is like
[1:46:35.920 --> 1:46:40.640]  the aliens the you know the demons the vampires
[1:46:40.640 --> 1:46:45.280]  it was really a pathetic show it was it was and they know it's all about
[1:46:45.280 --> 1:46:48.640]  presentation they would have the names of the good guys that believe the
[1:46:48.640 --> 1:46:51.920]  government real small concise exact then what truth
[1:46:51.920 --> 1:46:55.200]  there it all be crooked and off the side and messed up
[1:46:55.200 --> 1:46:59.200]  knowing that if names are messed up that makes people not like it
[1:46:59.200 --> 1:47:05.120]  i mean just basic tricks they used the language of film
[1:47:05.680 --> 1:47:08.560]  yeah i mean they take film students that couldn't get a job and i guess these
[1:47:08.560 --> 1:47:11.280]  guys want to make a couple hundred thousand a year so they would
[1:47:11.280 --> 1:47:15.040]  sell their mother out for it i mean that jfk thing they did where it shows the
[1:47:15.040 --> 1:47:18.560]  green jelly and shooting the head and it's from totally different spots the
[1:47:18.560 --> 1:47:21.520]  where the shooters were at and it's totally fake
[1:47:21.520 --> 1:47:25.760]  i mean there's no i mean listen though mike i've never seen
[1:47:25.760 --> 1:47:31.040]  a hit piece this flimsy i almost thought like they were secretly on our side
[1:47:31.040 --> 1:47:34.960]  and trying to screw themselves up
[1:47:36.160 --> 1:47:39.520]  just lost revero with our connection to hawaii
[1:47:39.520 --> 1:47:42.640]  let's start going to calls while we're getting mike back on with us
[1:47:42.640 --> 1:47:48.560]  joanne in california doine you're on the air hey alex good to talk to you again i
[1:47:48.560 --> 1:47:51.840]  was uh i didn't realize i didn't see that hit piece last night
[1:47:51.840 --> 1:47:55.520]  but um i've done a lot of research on a 9-11 project
[1:47:55.520 --> 1:47:59.520]  wait and and uh information on concentration and theme camps
[1:47:59.520 --> 1:48:03.840]  even prior to 2000 election with george w bush
[1:48:03.840 --> 1:48:07.760]  and uh i saw i had a lot of information i was researching at that time got a lot
[1:48:07.760 --> 1:48:11.920]  of it off of your website in fact one thing i didn't mention last time i
[1:48:11.920 --> 1:48:14.960]  called about the uh when you're talking about the swine flu
[1:48:14.960 --> 1:48:18.400]  vaccinations that uh when i took that vaccination
[1:48:18.400 --> 1:48:25.600]  in 1976 i was a linguist with the u.s army i was part of the army and army
[1:48:25.600 --> 1:48:29.920]  security agency which i later found out was a division of the national
[1:48:29.920 --> 1:48:33.280]  security agency so that was kind of an eye
[1:48:33.280 --> 1:48:36.880]  opener and in addition i have seen a lot of
[1:48:36.880 --> 1:48:41.120]  things on your website and other places that have
[1:48:41.120 --> 1:48:45.840]  opened my eyes to so much that the the government is trying to
[1:48:45.840 --> 1:48:53.600]  to blind us to or make us believers of that it's all of all a false paradigm
[1:48:53.600 --> 1:48:58.880]  so yeah i was listening to mike rebaro and i agree with a lot that he said
[1:48:58.880 --> 1:49:02.400]  uh steven jones in particular i was watching some of his
[1:49:02.400 --> 1:49:09.120]  information some of from your website uh about the 9-11 attacks and how
[1:49:09.120 --> 1:49:12.800]  how the thermite reaction brought down the twin towers because i don't i never
[1:49:12.800 --> 1:49:16.000]  believed that it could fall straight down like that unless there was some
[1:49:16.000 --> 1:49:20.560]  sort of thermite reaction well i mean here's an example here's
[1:49:20.560 --> 1:49:25.680]  the progressive the ap also reported it the pentagon wants authority to post
[1:49:25.680 --> 1:49:29.360]  almost 400 000 military personnel in the u.s for emergencies and homeland
[1:49:29.360 --> 1:49:33.440]  security the dhs own internal reports that we released
[1:49:33.440 --> 1:49:40.400]  say that their main battle force uh is designed and is set up
[1:49:40.400 --> 1:49:46.000]  to engage the american people in combat operations and for civil unrest
[1:49:46.000 --> 1:49:52.000]  and then they try to run around and deny
[1:49:52.000 --> 1:49:55.920]  that this even exists or is real let's bring mike rebaro back up who's with us
[1:49:55.920 --> 1:50:00.000]  mike i mean how long is this going to work it's kind of like
[1:50:00.000 --> 1:50:05.680]  all these big soros uh rockefeller foundation
[1:50:05.680 --> 1:50:12.400]  uh groups media matters and others are saying i'm a liar there's no plan for
[1:50:12.400 --> 1:50:16.000]  national compulsory service when he's given speeches the president
[1:50:16.000 --> 1:50:18.880]  the chief of staff and they've introduced the bills
[1:50:18.880 --> 1:50:23.440]  i mean how long can they just ball face lie and get away with it mike
[1:50:23.440 --> 1:50:26.880]  well that's a two-part question they're going to go online because they don't
[1:50:26.880 --> 1:50:30.240]  know other way to operate right now they've been doing it for so long how
[1:50:30.240 --> 1:50:32.640]  long can they get away with it i don't think they're getting away with it
[1:50:32.640 --> 1:50:35.920]  right now i mean that's certainly the sense i get from the people who write
[1:50:35.920 --> 1:50:40.080]  into my website who listen to your show i think most americans do know they're
[1:50:40.080 --> 1:50:42.720]  being lied to on a pretty much continuing basis
[1:50:42.720 --> 1:50:46.320]  uh i think most americans have come to understand we're the most lied to people
[1:50:46.320 --> 1:50:49.360]  on the face of the earth i think the reason the government is in
[1:50:49.360 --> 1:50:54.640]  panic mode is they understand the lies don't work anymore but they don't know
[1:50:54.640 --> 1:50:58.320]  what to do they can't start telling the truth they've told way too many lies
[1:50:58.320 --> 1:51:01.520]  yeah stay there stay there

[1:54:35.520 --> 1:54:59.840]  oh i'm late getting into my chair here i apologize to everyone
[1:54:59.840 --> 1:55:02.880]  so much going on behind the scenes during the breaks
[1:55:02.880 --> 1:55:05.840]  people coming into the office micro vero with us for a little bit in the next
[1:55:05.840 --> 1:55:08.640]  hour then i'm going to launch into how they're
[1:55:08.640 --> 1:55:12.640]  demonizing the militia and everybody else in fact here's an example
[1:55:12.640 --> 1:55:16.240]  colorado g.o.p calls for an apology for democratic
[1:55:16.240 --> 1:55:21.440]  office vandalism turns out someone who worked for the democratic party went and
[1:55:21.440 --> 1:55:26.080]  attacked the democratic offices
[1:55:26.080 --> 1:55:29.680]  i mean that's i haven't seen a case where a
[1:55:29.680 --> 1:55:34.880]  political office gets vandalized or where a swastika gets painted on the door
[1:55:34.880 --> 1:55:37.840]  where it isn't someone doing it for attention
[1:55:37.840 --> 1:55:41.440]  whether they're black or jewish or the democratic party
[1:55:41.440 --> 1:55:46.480]  i mean i i mean this just doesn't exist i i mean i've never seen it
[1:55:46.480 --> 1:55:51.120]  micro vero i mean have you it's like finding a tooth fairy or a
[1:55:51.120 --> 1:55:56.560]  unicorn to actually find a real attack on the democratic party
[1:55:56.560 --> 1:56:00.160]  von brun clearly was working for them he'd been in federal custody and mental
[1:56:00.160 --> 1:56:02.800]  institution for years with that other fake mental
[1:56:02.800 --> 1:56:06.400]  institution event with the dynamite he did at the fellow deserve an 88
[1:56:06.400 --> 1:56:10.720]  i mean i've never seen a case but here it is denver post
[1:56:10.720 --> 1:56:16.400]  totally staged mic micro vero well i have come to the conclusion i mean
[1:56:16.400 --> 1:56:21.120]  the few times they actually catch the perpetrators of hate crimes i mean 99
[1:56:21.120 --> 1:56:23.680]  percent of the time it turns out to be a hoax to
[1:56:23.680 --> 1:56:27.040]  generate political sympathy or to build political support for a particular
[1:56:27.040 --> 1:56:29.920]  agenda i am rapidly coming to the conclusion
[1:56:29.920 --> 1:56:34.400]  that there may not be any real genuine acts of terror in the world
[1:56:34.400 --> 1:56:37.120]  because when somebody wants to affect a change
[1:56:37.120 --> 1:56:41.120]  they need public support and acts of terror destroy public support
[1:56:41.120 --> 1:56:45.200]  for whoever is blamed on them so just like we had israel that staged the
[1:56:45.200 --> 1:56:48.160]  hijacking and the raid on antebite antebite
[1:56:48.160 --> 1:56:52.160]  to destroy sympathy for the palestinians i'm starting to reach the point where i
[1:56:52.160 --> 1:56:54.880]  think anytime there's a hate crime or an act of terror
[1:56:54.880 --> 1:56:58.720]  it's more than likely going to be a fraud somebody's being framed
[1:56:58.720 --> 1:57:02.320]  in order to make them look bad i mean just as we're seeing the government
[1:57:02.320 --> 1:57:05.440]  plant agent provocateurs within protests and the
[1:57:05.440 --> 1:57:08.800]  anti-war movement and the truther movement in order to make us look bad
[1:57:08.800 --> 1:57:13.280]  it's all a hoax it's government by deception well they're stealing trillions
[1:57:13.280 --> 1:57:16.160]  of dollars a month they're going to have to commit crimes
[1:57:16.160 --> 1:57:20.000]  to blame them on us so they can use their force against us
[1:57:20.000 --> 1:57:24.560]  they build a military force up they've got a stage military attacks to say
[1:57:24.560 --> 1:57:29.040]  we're a military enemy so they can have the rules of engagement
[1:57:29.040 --> 1:57:31.760]  to go up against us you know i thought about the film what five days in
[1:57:31.760 --> 1:57:36.240]  september won an academy award about the hostage crisis
[1:57:36.240 --> 1:57:41.440]  uh at the munit games and at the end of the film they have the head of german
[1:57:41.440 --> 1:57:46.240]  intelligence just come out and admit oh yeah we staged all this
[1:57:46.240 --> 1:57:50.960]  and then to let the palestinians go we staged a hijacking of a jet to let them
[1:57:50.960 --> 1:57:56.000]  go and they just admit it like it's no big deal
[1:57:56.000 --> 1:57:59.600]  that they i mean it's and no one gets in trouble it's like
[1:57:59.600 --> 1:58:05.760]  yeah we staged it all haha it's funny yeah it is it's it's all image
[1:58:05.760 --> 1:58:09.120]  manipulation it's all manipulation of the people using the press

[1:58:20.160 --> 1:58:24.640]  hoax it is all government by deception and here's the
[1:58:24.640 --> 1:58:28.560]  situation the analogy i like to use is the internet is the modern
[1:58:28.560 --> 1:58:32.160]  equivalent of guttenberg's movable type printing if you go back and you look
[1:58:32.160 --> 1:58:36.720]  at the social upheaval that attended the publication of inexpensive easy to
[1:58:36.720 --> 1:58:42.240]  afford books they went to stay there we got a finish on the other side

[1:59:00.240 --> 1:59:04.320]  they found that over 260 chemicals in pollutants are present in municipal
[1:59:04.320 --> 1:59:07.600]  drinking water many of these chemicals are directly linked to cancer
[1:59:07.600 --> 1:59:10.640]  reproductive immune and developmental system diseases

[1:59:53.520 --> 2:00:00.640]  waging war on corruption alex jones on the gcm radio networks
[2:00:00.640 --> 2:00:11.600]  big brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers
[2:00:11.600 --> 2:00:19.360]  well so does he he's alex jones on the gcm radio network and now live from austin
[2:00:19.360 --> 2:00:23.440]  texas alex jones
[2:00:23.440 --> 2:00:29.840]  micro vero be with us for another 20 minutes and i'm going to play
[2:00:29.840 --> 2:00:36.320]  most of this 13 minute video internal fbi training video and how it ties in to
[2:00:36.320 --> 2:00:40.240]  the provocateurs the police state the stasi
[2:00:40.240 --> 2:00:44.240]  tattletale system that's coming up we're continuing with your calls
[2:00:44.240 --> 2:00:47.520]  mike you were trying to talk about the guttenberg printable type
[2:00:47.520 --> 2:00:51.280]  they tried to suppress it 500 years ago didn't work
[2:00:51.280 --> 2:00:53.840]  i would say the internet's a bigger development from that you know we know
[2:00:53.840 --> 2:01:00.080]  what the nsa and darpas said back in the 70s they called it worldwide wiretap
[2:01:00.080 --> 2:01:03.600]  ww dot was the joke because they were going to track trace
[2:01:03.600 --> 2:01:06.960]  have global commerce controlled by it and they're still using it as that
[2:01:06.960 --> 2:01:11.440]  double edged sword over confidently we hope they continue to be over confident
[2:01:11.440 --> 2:01:14.320]  so they don't shut it down too quickly because we know they're moving towards
[2:01:14.320 --> 2:01:17.440]  it regardless but now they're starting to lose their
[2:01:17.440 --> 2:01:20.400]  arrogance which means they're more on their game that's dangerous i like the
[2:01:20.400 --> 2:01:22.960]  arrogance i like the imperial hubris but
[2:01:22.960 --> 2:01:27.600]  you can speak to that well basically in a nutshell
[2:01:27.600 --> 2:01:31.760]  they have discovered that there is simply too much going on on the net
[2:01:31.760 --> 2:01:34.640]  they can't track at all they can't monitor at all
[2:01:34.640 --> 2:01:38.480]  yes they could probably keep an eye on certain individuals like you or i
[2:01:38.480 --> 2:01:42.240]  but they just can't keep track of everything going on and their concern
[2:01:42.240 --> 2:01:46.800]  now is not with anyone individual because the anger and disenfranchisement
[2:01:46.800 --> 2:01:50.000]  with the american people has reached the point where the number of people who
[2:01:50.000 --> 2:01:52.720]  are unhappy with the government numbers and the hundreds of millions
[2:01:52.720 --> 2:01:56.080]  they can't watch them all they can't store it all
[2:01:56.080 --> 2:02:00.000]  more importantly they can't correlate the data the analysis of the tools to
[2:02:00.000 --> 2:02:03.360]  analyze the intercepts and and everything simply
[2:02:03.360 --> 2:02:07.360]  are not adequate to the task it's like coming home and having 20 000 voicemails
[2:02:07.360 --> 2:02:10.880]  even the stuff that gets flagged per operative it's in the tens of thousands
[2:02:10.880 --> 2:02:14.320]  it's got to be if you look at all the evidence now
[2:02:14.320 --> 2:02:18.320]  i hope the establishment doesn't try to stage terror attacks or stage rioting
[2:02:18.320 --> 2:02:21.360]  because i think it's just going to get out of control and the cops are just
[2:02:21.360 --> 2:02:25.440]  going to stand down i think the cops more and more on our side might
[2:02:25.440 --> 2:02:28.960]  i would tend to agree with you that's the sense i'm getting from a lot of the
[2:02:28.960 --> 2:02:32.080]  reader emails here the bottom line is i think everybody's getting
[2:02:32.080 --> 2:02:34.880]  disenfranchised with the federal government they don't trust them
[2:02:34.880 --> 2:02:38.240]  they don't know what's going on they've seen too many double crosses
[2:02:38.240 --> 2:02:40.880]  and i think one of the reasons the government is getting very nervous is
[2:02:40.880 --> 2:02:44.240]  they're no longer certain of being able to win a confrontation against the
[2:02:44.240 --> 2:02:49.920]  american people i agree now i have all these macho
[2:02:49.920 --> 2:02:53.040]  guys constantly on my website guaranteed their feds and provocateurs or
[2:02:53.040 --> 2:02:56.000]  they'd be arrested for what they're doing the feds would send me a subpoena and
[2:02:56.000 --> 2:02:58.400]  you know fbi would show up if they were real
[2:02:58.400 --> 2:03:01.520]  go you're a wimp alex you're not calling for violence you
[2:03:01.520 --> 2:03:05.040]  you know is there something wrong with you you're a bad guy
[2:03:05.040 --> 2:03:10.400]  and uh that's you get that too and then these are total tough guy feds or
[2:03:10.400 --> 2:03:13.840]  their idiots being handled by the feds and i'm not buying another crap i mean
[2:03:13.840 --> 2:03:17.360]  here's the Denver post with democratic party workers
[2:03:17.360 --> 2:03:21.280]  attacking their own facility to blame it on enemies of obama care
[2:03:21.280 --> 2:03:25.520]  this is false flag terror and i've got a whole stack here of mainstream news
[2:03:25.520 --> 2:03:30.240]  about all the neo-nazis every group or feds southern parvy law center running
[2:03:30.240 --> 2:03:34.480]  elaheem city in the white supremacist hal turner the top nazi
[2:03:34.480 --> 2:03:40.560]  a uh a fed i mean you're just all feds and we're going to expose you
[2:03:40.560 --> 2:03:44.800]  the government has to create the enemies that it uses to scarce into obedience
[2:03:44.800 --> 2:03:49.120]  if there were no enemies if they're you know after the soviet union fell is
[2:03:49.120 --> 2:03:51.520]  really when trust and blind faith in the american
[2:03:51.520 --> 2:03:55.040]  government began to erode because we were expecting a peace dividend
[2:03:55.040 --> 2:03:58.640]  and no we couldn't have a peace dividend we've got to have more war war on
[2:03:58.640 --> 2:04:02.160]  poverty or war on terror or war on global warming or whatever
[2:04:02.160 --> 2:04:05.920]  and those of us who've been around long enough in students of history understood
[2:04:05.920 --> 2:04:09.680]  that at the end of world war two when we were expecting a peace dividend
[2:04:09.680 --> 2:04:12.880]  that's when the cold war against the commies was fanned up
[2:04:12.880 --> 2:04:17.200]  to keep the money flowing to the defense contractors to keep up the fear
[2:04:17.200 --> 2:04:20.880]  to keep us slaves to our fear to benefit the government
[2:04:20.880 --> 2:04:24.080]  well we're tired of being afraid a government that uses fear to control its
[2:04:24.080 --> 2:04:27.840]  people it once the fear burns itself out and fear is very
[2:04:27.840 --> 2:04:30.560]  exhausting and we stop being afraid and we start
[2:04:30.560 --> 2:04:34.400]  thinking it all starts unraveling i personally think this process
[2:04:34.400 --> 2:04:38.240]  is well underway i don't think it can be diverted i don't think it can be stopped
[2:04:38.240 --> 2:04:42.400]  i think the future of the u.s government is definitely very limited it's just a
[2:04:42.400 --> 2:04:45.760]  question of when and there's also this whole line
[2:04:45.760 --> 2:04:50.880]  put out by them uh that everything will fall apart if we don't have this corrupt
[2:04:50.880 --> 2:04:54.000]  system no this is a parasitic system that's
[2:04:54.000 --> 2:04:57.360]  waging war against reality against the free market against

[2:09:02.880 --> 2:09:06.960]  hey gentlemen good to hear you i'm just reading on the internet from various
[2:09:06.960 --> 2:09:11.760]  sources here that we need to i see that they're
[2:09:11.760 --> 2:09:16.400]  trying to divide and conquer possibly us but the the people themselves from
[2:09:16.400 --> 2:09:20.240]  getting the real news it says senators j rockefeller
[2:09:20.240 --> 2:09:24.160]  feller and olympia snow have reintroduced
[2:09:24.160 --> 2:09:30.560]  bill s 773 to give obama clear cut abilities to shut down the internet
[2:09:30.560 --> 2:09:34.320]  your thoughts tell you what do do do me a big favor and turn your radio off
[2:09:34.320 --> 2:09:37.200]  number one so i can actually hear what you're saying
[2:09:37.200 --> 2:09:40.800]  you prefaced that with trying to divide us
[2:09:40.800 --> 2:09:45.440]  and i i get these nonsensical emails every day why aren't you covering the
[2:09:45.440 --> 2:09:49.120]  cyber security act we're really the first to be covering
[2:09:49.120 --> 2:09:52.800]  in the last couple years since i saw the pentagon proposing it
[2:09:52.800 --> 2:09:57.200]  and it's actually in my last obama film and we just covered it last hour
[2:09:57.200 --> 2:10:00.960]  you're asking what i thought of that did you just do an interest
[2:10:00.960 --> 2:10:04.800]  um well yeah because i'm sorry i had my speaker phone on so
[2:10:04.800 --> 2:10:08.000]  i apologize for that no that's okay but you i'm trying to understand the
[2:10:08.000 --> 2:10:10.960]  question you prefaced it with them trying to divide us
[2:10:10.960 --> 2:10:16.080]  yes um most of the attacks we get are just nonsensical it's like
[2:10:16.080 --> 2:10:19.680]  why don't you expose masons we do why don't you expose corruption the
[2:10:19.680 --> 2:10:22.320]  catholic church we do why don't you expose corruption the pros and
[2:10:22.320 --> 2:10:25.840]  church we do why don't you expose corruption israel we do
[2:10:25.840 --> 2:10:29.920]  uh why are you covering up 9 11 why are you not covering it
[2:10:29.920 --> 2:10:33.040]  we are the progenitors of it of exposing it
[2:10:33.040 --> 2:10:37.120]  so yes but i mean really people should ignore that the establishment just

[2:11:03.040 --> 2:11:05.760]  about how they're drugging the water and want to take our children at birth and
[2:11:05.760 --> 2:11:08.800]  eradicate the family and put implantable chips in us
[2:11:08.800 --> 2:11:11.840]  hey do you know the wall street journals reporting that they want to

[2:11:32.160 --> 2:11:35.200]  government is out there trying to keep us fighting amongst each other it's
[2:11:35.200 --> 2:11:38.400]  called divide and conquer whether it's the young gets the old men against women
[2:11:38.400 --> 2:11:41.760]  black against white rich against poor 9 11 truth or against government
[2:11:41.760 --> 2:11:45.200]  supporter the idea is that we're kept in little tiny
[2:11:45.200 --> 2:11:49.600]  fragments of society squabbling amongst each other what the government is most
[2:11:49.600 --> 2:11:54.160]  terrified of right now is that we the american people are waking up to the
[2:11:54.160 --> 2:11:59.280]  fact that we are just one american people and if we actually come
[2:11:59.280 --> 2:12:02.640]  together with a single idea in mind which is that the
[2:12:02.640 --> 2:12:06.640]  government is the source of all of our problems then the government knows it's
[2:12:06.640 --> 2:12:09.520]  going to be finished and they're trying to find some way to prevent that from
[2:12:09.520 --> 2:12:12.240]  happening and the government plan is to make
[2:12:12.240 --> 2:12:15.680]  government so big destroy the free market destroy private property
[2:12:15.680 --> 2:12:19.600]  destroy self-sufficiency so bad that they'll have a giant hundred million
[2:12:19.600 --> 2:12:23.920]  person army of total moron tv watching welfare check
[2:12:23.920 --> 2:12:28.240]  cashing fluoride heads that they can point as a weapon
[2:12:28.240 --> 2:12:31.280]  at anyone that doesn't serve them and they plan to employ
[2:12:31.280 --> 2:12:35.120]  all this scum and all this weak-minded people to serve them
[2:12:35.120 --> 2:12:39.760]  but you know i have a higher view of the american people than the elite do
[2:12:39.760 --> 2:12:43.920]  i think folks are waking up across the board and i just don't see it working
[2:12:43.920 --> 2:12:49.040]  i see them staging terror attacks a new oklahoma city to try to blame on us
[2:12:49.040 --> 2:12:52.960]  but this isn't 1995 isn't mike that isn't gonna work isn't
[2:12:52.960 --> 2:12:57.360]  no it isn't at the the old methods just don't work they're not getting it that
[2:12:57.360 --> 2:13:00.640]  is our biggest hope for the future is the people who are in charge of the
[2:13:00.640 --> 2:13:04.720]  government the intelligence agencies really are a bunch of old cold war
[2:13:04.720 --> 2:13:08.800]  fossils they're just like j rockefeller they wish the internet would go away
[2:13:08.800 --> 2:13:12.160]  but they don't know how to deal with it they don't understand
[2:13:12.160 --> 2:13:15.920]  that the world in which governments could lie to their people on such a scale
[2:13:15.920 --> 2:13:20.000]  simply does not exist anymore and if they persist in playing
[2:13:20.000 --> 2:13:23.760]  the game as if it does sooner or later they're going to commit an
[2:13:23.760 --> 2:13:28.160]  error a lie or an act so great they will not be able to quell the public
[2:13:28.160 --> 2:13:32.320]  backlash well i mean 84 percent of new york times
[2:13:32.320 --> 2:13:35.760]  probably they're being lied to about 9 11 so
[2:13:35.760 --> 2:13:38.720]  everybody knows about gulfa tonkin they know about ajax
[2:13:38.720 --> 2:13:42.480]  they know about all this now the army field manuals how to stage terror attacks
[2:13:42.480 --> 2:13:45.520]  are public i mean it's over for them and they may
[2:13:45.520 --> 2:13:50.400]  buy some time staging terror attacks but it's only going to make it worse
[2:13:50.400 --> 2:13:54.560]  and if i was a fed and wasn't part of this i wouldn't put my kids in federal
[2:13:54.560 --> 2:13:58.480]  daycare centers because the feds will target daycare centers they want
[2:13:58.480 --> 2:14:04.000]  the image of bloody children and so to the feds out there they kill your kid
[2:14:04.000 --> 2:14:10.000]  i'm your friend i tried to warn you okay uh let's go absolutely go ahead mike
[2:14:10.000 --> 2:14:13.440]  no i said you're absolutely right the government has no loyalty
[2:14:13.440 --> 2:14:17.200]  they will kill their own to make a point they always have
[2:14:17.200 --> 2:14:22.320]  well that's that's simple chess that's simple using a pawn in a sacrifice
[2:14:22.320 --> 2:14:25.600]  101 at west point is how to send in a group that you know is going to get
[2:14:25.600 --> 2:14:28.880]  wiped out to draw out the enemy that's just military terminology
[2:14:28.880 --> 2:14:32.480]  and the public needs to get their mind around how the world really works
[2:14:32.480 --> 2:14:36.160]  instead of living at a third grade level
[2:14:37.840 --> 2:14:40.960]  let's go ahead and take another call here let's talk to richard and rhoda

[2:15:11.200 --> 2:15:18.720]  on there are here in rhoda island that i saw them that i this was weird because
[2:15:18.720 --> 2:15:22.240]  school is not in all right and i saw them
[2:15:22.240 --> 2:15:25.680]  at a high school here in providence let's be clear you saw
[2:15:25.680 --> 2:15:33.280]  you saw youth brigades yes yes approximately probably 25 to 50 of them
[2:15:33.280 --> 2:15:36.960]  and i thought it was weird because they they're at hope classical high school
[2:15:36.960 --> 2:15:40.640]  and rhoda island here and they were they were on the football field doing
[2:15:40.640 --> 2:15:44.400]  calisthenics and they all had those green shirts on
[2:15:44.400 --> 2:15:50.400]  that said yes we can and i know i mean i mean they've got these people
[2:15:50.400 --> 2:15:54.160]  knocking out windows in denver of the democrats to blame it on republicans
[2:15:54.160 --> 2:15:57.760]  they've got them going and banging on doors asking to you support obama
[2:15:57.760 --> 2:16:00.880]  they've got them shouting people down at town halls and punching people on the
[2:16:00.880 --> 2:16:05.120]  face being ordered to and then media matters run by
[2:16:05.120 --> 2:16:09.280]  george soros comes out and attacks me and says obama
[2:16:09.280 --> 2:16:14.880]  never called for youth brigades when they passed the bill to set up the federal
[2:16:14.880 --> 2:16:18.800]  body to do it i mean it says compulsory service
[2:16:18.800 --> 2:16:22.160]  and they're sad i mean mike what's going to happen when everybody hears them
[2:16:22.160 --> 2:16:25.920]  deny they're doing this and then they see video clips of rama manual
[2:16:25.920 --> 2:16:30.560]  and obama and then see the youth brigades well the people who are willing
[2:16:30.560 --> 2:16:33.200]  to accept the fact that the government is lying will just see it as a
[2:16:33.200 --> 2:16:36.560]  confirmation that they're on the right path we still have that segment of the
[2:16:36.560 --> 2:16:40.320]  society that is so afraid of the government they will not let them see
[2:16:40.320 --> 2:16:43.600]  the signs of obvious deception and uh... and lies
[2:16:43.600 --> 2:16:46.480]  because they don't want to face the choice of what to do about it
[2:16:46.480 --> 2:16:49.760]  but it will convince more of the fence centers and over time
[2:16:49.760 --> 2:16:52.880]  we're seeing more and more people come over to our side
[2:16:52.880 --> 2:16:56.000]  they want to know the truth they're ready to deal with the truth they're ready
[2:16:56.000 --> 2:16:59.280]  to deal with the consequences of knowing the truth it is an inevitable
[2:16:59.280 --> 2:17:03.840]  process right now admiral yama moto used to say the american people are a sleeping
[2:17:03.840 --> 2:17:07.840]  giant slow to arouse slow to anger and slow to forgive and he's

[2:17:47.920 --> 2:17:53.040]  on the history channel and on the discovery channel these shows
[2:17:53.040 --> 2:17:56.640]  and because last night i was watching them and i'm like making a connection

[2:17:59.840 --> 2:18:03.280]  shows that are planet earth planet earth planet earth
[2:18:03.280 --> 2:18:05.840]  everything about earth and the animals and they're all
[2:18:05.840 --> 2:18:09.040]  frolicking about and then on history you have
[2:18:09.040 --> 2:18:14.560]  life after people and shows like uh... the colony were people
[2:18:14.560 --> 2:18:17.680]  small colonies of people after a big disaster

[2:19:00.800 --> 2:19:05.600]  propaganda it's been that way ever since jay agarhoover and charlie chaplin
[2:19:05.600 --> 2:19:08.800]  uh... we're fighting with each other over how chaplin should show government
[2:19:08.800 --> 2:19:12.560]  officials in his movies and uh... you know we saw that during the the
[2:19:12.560 --> 2:19:15.520]  mccarthy hearings uh... the the communist witch hunts in
[2:19:15.520 --> 2:19:18.960]  hollywood what they were really doing was scrubbing out anybody who wasn't
[2:19:18.960 --> 2:19:21.280]  willing to make films bashing on the communist
[2:19:21.280 --> 2:19:24.560]  to start the cold war and we we're seeing it now
[2:19:24.560 --> 2:19:28.080]  there are channels like national geographic last night heavily propagandistic
[2:19:28.080 --> 2:19:30.800]  about nine eleven history channels going that way
[2:19:30.800 --> 2:19:34.160]  i used to be a big fan of history channel now i've seen so many shows that
[2:19:34.160 --> 2:19:37.760]  are very obviously trying to sell the official government story on stuff i
[2:19:37.760 --> 2:19:40.960]  don't watch them anymore i'm pretty much i'm watching smithsonian channel

[2:24:17.680 --> 2:24:22.160]  i wanted to first go over this fbi internal quantico
[2:24:22.160 --> 2:24:26.400]  training video they also distribute to police uh and to the now
[2:24:26.400 --> 2:24:31.920]  400 000 strong domestic army force that is being reported on by the
[2:24:31.920 --> 2:24:36.960]  progressive and the hill newspaper in fact i'll show that again to everybody
[2:24:36.960 --> 2:24:40.640]  here on tv who's watching us at prisonplanet.tv
[2:24:40.640 --> 2:24:44.240]  if you're a radio listener just google the term the pentagon wants authority
[2:24:44.240 --> 2:24:48.400]  to post almost 400 000 military personnel in the u.s
[2:24:48.400 --> 2:24:52.560]  for domestic operations to quote engage the american people
[2:24:52.560 --> 2:24:55.200]  and the army times first reported this last year
[2:24:55.200 --> 2:25:00.480]  as 20 000 well first 4 000 then 20 000 now 400 000
[2:25:00.480 --> 2:25:03.680]  and we cover this in the upcoming film camp fema
[2:25:03.680 --> 2:25:08.000]  so uh this is happening and when we broke the
[2:25:08.000 --> 2:25:11.680]  homeland security report and the mic report the reason the police and a
[2:25:11.680 --> 2:25:14.480]  federal marshal in the other case sent it to us is they were so upset
[2:25:14.480 --> 2:25:18.160]  they teach them in there the number one threat is gun owners and veterans
[2:25:18.160 --> 2:25:21.840]  and that's true you're not going to accept 80 plus percent taxes you're not
[2:25:21.840 --> 2:25:25.600]  going to accept all this tyranny and so they knew they would sell you on
[2:25:25.600 --> 2:25:29.120]  homeland security in the name of foreigners or brown people using
[2:25:29.120 --> 2:25:32.800]  racism but but the whole time with the john warren defense
[2:25:32.800 --> 2:25:37.520]  authorization act all of it even under bush it was all set up
[2:25:37.520 --> 2:25:41.280]  and the training manuals we've been breaking these for years
[2:25:41.280 --> 2:25:44.960]  we're all about gun owners conservatives landowners
[2:25:44.960 --> 2:25:48.560]  uh people that won't go along with this so
[2:25:48.560 --> 2:25:51.680]  you wonder why when you go through the tsa while you take your shoes off why
[2:25:51.680 --> 2:25:55.360]  they only have liquids it's an act of submission
[2:25:55.360 --> 2:25:58.720]  make you take your shoes off a act of supplication
[2:25:58.720 --> 2:26:02.080]  an act of answering questions people who've never been asked questions people
[2:26:02.080 --> 2:26:06.160]  who don't see themselves as criminals this is teaching you you are a criminal
[2:26:06.160 --> 2:26:08.880]  and in england they now have squads that ask you questions on the side of the
[2:26:08.880 --> 2:26:12.160]  road it's happened to me it's happened to the watson brothers who work for us who
[2:26:12.160 --> 2:26:14.640]  live in england uh it happened to all street journal
[2:26:14.640 --> 2:26:18.160]  writer sarah mcbride who was here she repeatedly had him come up and ask her
[2:26:18.160 --> 2:26:22.000]  you know if she was bad this is about letting you know that you
[2:26:22.000 --> 2:26:27.200]  live in east germany so we have all of that going on
[2:26:27.200 --> 2:26:30.560]  but i want to just play this tape and go through how it creates this atmosphere
[2:26:30.560 --> 2:26:33.360]  of fear you know the one lady they talk to she's
[2:26:33.360 --> 2:26:39.440]  photographing a dam she's a terrorist uh she's got scuba gear it turns out she's
[2:26:39.440 --> 2:26:44.320]  guilty but they're going to let her go and put her in the terrorist database
[2:26:44.320 --> 2:26:48.640]  okay and this local officer is going under federal control in this video
[2:26:48.640 --> 2:26:51.760]  he's now part of this federal slash global inter poll
[2:26:51.760 --> 2:26:55.520]  system so there's all these different layers
[2:26:55.520 --> 2:27:01.760]  to this and now you wonder why you i mean i've been in dc i challenge anybody
[2:27:01.760 --> 2:27:05.440]  you go to dc you're 200 yards away from the washington monument videotaping it
[2:27:05.440 --> 2:27:08.160]  they come over and say turn your cameras off there's no law we just think you
[2:27:08.160 --> 2:27:12.400]  might be a terrorist and they harass boy scout troops and tourists
[2:27:12.400 --> 2:27:17.280]  it's about letting you know that you're a slave it's about breaking your back
[2:27:17.280 --> 2:27:20.640]  it's about letting you know you're dominated it's about letting you know
[2:27:20.640 --> 2:27:24.320]  you live in a police state local san antonio news tried to go down to the
[2:27:24.320 --> 2:27:29.040]  new nsa base taking over the internet quote killing the internet to save the
[2:27:29.040 --> 2:27:32.800]  internet and the feds come off base and threaten
[2:27:32.800 --> 2:27:36.400]  to arrest them and grab their camera this is the new america
[2:27:36.400 --> 2:27:40.240]  where the military runs your life just like guatemala or nazi germany
[2:27:40.240 --> 2:27:44.160]  bill would give presidency emergency control over the internet and create a
[2:27:44.160 --> 2:27:47.600]  new group of private it officials that work for the government
[2:27:47.600 --> 2:27:50.960]  just like under infraguard with the fbi recruiting 55 000
[2:27:50.960 --> 2:27:55.040]  executives will shoot to kill orders over their employees
[2:27:55.040 --> 2:27:58.880]  and they now are going to control the private networks and so you can't
[2:27:58.880 --> 2:28:03.840]  have a network unless the imperium the commissariat the political police
[2:28:03.840 --> 2:28:08.800]  give you the authorization and all this national news has been calling for my
[2:28:08.800 --> 2:28:11.040]  arrest and and for people putting up
[2:28:11.040 --> 2:28:15.760]  obama posters saying fascist or socialist
[2:28:15.760 --> 2:28:19.440]  here's the local paper outside austin freedom of hate speech
[2:28:19.440 --> 2:28:22.480]  and they say there's not a law against putting these up in haste county
[2:28:22.480 --> 2:28:28.480]  but there should be alex is evil see this is the new sovietization
[2:28:28.480 --> 2:28:31.600]  so we're going to go to break and come back and play most of this little 13
[2:28:31.600 --> 2:28:33.920]  minute training video i'm going to stop and make a few
[2:28:33.920 --> 2:28:38.400]  comments during it then i'm going to get into a full breakdown
[2:28:38.400 --> 2:28:41.360]  of how the feds operate how the globalist operate
[2:28:41.360 --> 2:28:45.920]  how they're demonizing militias how they're infiltrating militias
[2:28:45.920 --> 2:28:51.760]  how they're creating militias which then the feds direct to do violent things
[2:28:51.760 --> 2:28:55.120]  they find unstable people we're going to explain the
[2:28:55.120 --> 2:28:58.800]  mo of purely provocateur staged events by the feds
[2:28:58.800 --> 2:29:02.160]  and private mercenary groups we know they're using and foreign governments
[2:29:02.160 --> 2:29:05.200]  are also here in the u.s israelian british intelligence have been caught
[2:29:05.200 --> 2:29:07.680]  involved we told you years ago cheney had private
[2:29:07.680 --> 2:29:10.720]  hit teams in the u.s now it's been declassified
[2:29:10.720 --> 2:29:14.240]  because this current ci director i want to go to prison for it
[2:29:14.240 --> 2:29:17.280]  and we're going to walk through how we in every case
[2:29:17.280 --> 2:29:21.840]  when they find out that an entire clan group is founded and run by the feds
[2:29:21.840 --> 2:29:24.720]  every white supremacist group run and founded by the feds
[2:29:24.720 --> 2:29:29.440]  this is to radicalize political discourse inside the united states
[2:29:29.440 --> 2:29:33.200]  and to get us all in fighting with each other and i want to warn the feds that
[2:29:33.200 --> 2:29:37.120]  are part of this and the private mercenary groups that are part of this
[2:29:37.120 --> 2:29:40.800]  you're going to be hung out to drive by your bosses just like howl turner
[2:29:40.800 --> 2:29:44.160]  who they admit was their informant but now they're sending him to prison
[2:29:44.160 --> 2:29:47.680]  for making the threats too loud and too bold
[2:29:47.680 --> 2:29:51.360]  they will set you up just like leahar's the oswald and tim mcvey
[2:29:51.360 --> 2:29:55.200]  we're on the march the empire's on the run

[2:35:10.400 --> 2:35:12.800]  piece and they came back and said change it change it again they said you know
[2:35:12.800 --> 2:35:15.120]  what we're not giving alex jones any attention
[2:35:15.120 --> 2:35:18.720]  because the mainstream media has figured out even if they lie or spin or attack
[2:35:18.720 --> 2:35:21.680]  us because the piece really wasn't a very friendly piece it wasn't a negative
[2:35:21.680 --> 2:35:25.520]  piece but it was it was fair as they call it they had some negative things in it
[2:35:25.520 --> 2:35:28.800]  uh even negative stuff just people actually find out what we're really
[2:35:28.800 --> 2:35:31.520]  doing instead of what fake image was put out
[2:35:31.520 --> 2:35:34.400]  because the mainstream media has so little credibility in my experience of
[2:35:34.400 --> 2:35:37.680]  the big dominant channels but that's why i did do the interview because i know
[2:35:37.680 --> 2:35:41.280]  mark cuban according to the new york times i knew about it behind the scenes
[2:35:41.280 --> 2:35:44.480]  but had just heard a little bit talking to charlie sheen at the time
[2:35:44.480 --> 2:35:47.840]  he was going to put out the loose change final cut and suddenly he was getting
[2:35:47.840 --> 2:35:51.280]  threats from the securities exchange commission phone calls emails saying
[2:35:51.280 --> 2:35:54.720]  we're going to put you in jail for this loose change thing so then they dug up
[2:35:54.720 --> 2:35:57.600]  that he'd sold a tiny amount of stock or something
[2:35:57.600 --> 2:36:01.360]  and and indicted him and he said i'm not going to go along with this
[2:36:01.360 --> 2:36:05.040]  i'm going to fight you this is political and then he released the emails
[2:36:05.040 --> 2:36:08.320]  of them threatening him and i think the people that did that should go to jail
[2:36:08.320 --> 2:36:12.800]  so i'm saying that's that's why i mean i'm sure it'll be a 5050 piece i know
[2:36:12.800 --> 2:36:15.840]  mark does all court signs of stuff and he doesn't control what all his people do
[2:36:15.840 --> 2:36:19.200]  but my point is i'm doing it because it is hd net just to see what happens but
[2:36:19.200 --> 2:36:23.360]  yes we do turn down a lot of tv because we can have a minute for 10 hours
[2:36:23.360 --> 2:36:26.960]  and they'll just show the one time i you know rub my nose or something
[2:36:26.960 --> 2:36:30.880]  or or they'll zoom in on a coffee stain on the carpet or something i mean you
[2:36:30.880 --> 2:36:34.400]  know that kind of theater of the mind thing they do the language of film
[2:36:34.400 --> 2:36:37.200]  and so that's what's going on but instead of me ranting at you i do want to
[2:36:37.200 --> 2:36:40.400]  get into the militia analysis carol anything you want to say to the audience
[2:36:40.400 --> 2:36:43.520]  out there uh well we're doing a story on the
[2:36:43.520 --> 2:36:46.720]  resurgence of the militia and i haven't found yet that that's really
[2:36:46.720 --> 2:36:49.760]  happening i mean we we know that on the internet i'm seeing a lot more on the
[2:36:49.760 --> 2:36:52.640]  internet so you're our first interview
[2:36:52.640 --> 2:36:56.000]  and we're one of michigan in two weeks and and so right now i'm just
[2:36:56.000 --> 2:36:57.760]  gathering as much information as i can
[2:36:57.760 --> 2:37:01.360]  michigan's good but it's a giant nest of federal operations
[2:37:01.360 --> 2:37:05.360]  i mean you're probably going to be talking to i would say nine out of ten
[2:37:05.360 --> 2:37:08.000]  people they're going to come out and want to talk to you are going to be either
[2:37:08.000 --> 2:37:10.880]  federal informants or special forces operators oh really
[2:37:10.880 --> 2:37:14.800]  oh yeah so we should watch out no no i mean i mean they're going to
[2:37:14.800 --> 2:37:18.800]  act like clowns for you so i mean oh i see
[2:37:18.800 --> 2:37:23.200]  yeah so i mean i mean no that this is all theater of the mind so
[2:37:23.200 --> 2:37:26.880]  i'm just saying michigan is was where they ran their main operation in the
[2:37:26.880 --> 2:37:30.320]  nineties pre-demonization before the fed
[2:37:30.320 --> 2:37:34.240]  staged oklahoma city do you think that do you think
[2:37:34.240 --> 2:37:38.160]  that more and more people in america are turning to militias because they're
[2:37:38.160 --> 2:37:41.440]  unhappy with the way the government's being run now do you think that's true
[2:37:41.440 --> 2:37:46.560]  the people see the illegitimate actions of the government they see the 23.7
[2:37:46.560 --> 2:37:51.760]  trillion stolen in 10 months more than double the gdp
[2:37:51.760 --> 2:37:55.760]  they see the government doing unconstitutional things across the
[2:37:55.760 --> 2:37:58.640]  board while amassing paramilitary forces
[2:37:58.640 --> 2:38:02.960]  announcing 400 000 combat troops to be deployed the government saying gun
[2:38:02.960 --> 2:38:05.200]  owners are terrorist veterans are terrorists
[2:38:05.200 --> 2:38:08.560]  ron paul supporters are the you know the big threat
[2:38:08.560 --> 2:38:12.640]  and so yes we've seen all-time records for a solid year
[2:38:12.640 --> 2:38:17.200]  gun buying and purchasing and the real militias aren't going to talk to you
[2:38:17.200 --> 2:38:20.080]  you're never going to see them and they're everywhere and usually it's
[2:38:20.080 --> 2:38:24.560]  four or five good friends former military who had a little shooting club
[2:38:24.560 --> 2:38:29.600]  and they uh in fact print me off the gadston flag quote again
[2:38:29.600 --> 2:38:32.960]  i think that's good to describe the real militia
[2:38:32.960 --> 2:38:36.160]  the what what what benjamin franklin said about it
[2:38:36.160 --> 2:38:39.520]  why our original symbol is not the eagle it was the rattlesnake
[2:38:39.520 --> 2:38:43.200]  and the marine course first symbol was not the anchors
[2:38:43.200 --> 2:38:46.400]  but the rattlesnake because it's not looking for trouble
[2:38:46.400 --> 2:38:48.880]  but its eyes are never blinking it's always got it you know it's always
[2:38:48.880 --> 2:38:51.840]  watching and it rattles its tail and says don't
[2:38:51.840 --> 2:38:55.440]  tread on me and so the people are arming up in mass
[2:38:55.440 --> 2:38:58.320]  and they're aware of the fema camps they're aware of the entire agenda
[2:38:58.320 --> 2:39:01.520]  and they're ready to defend the republic and but they're not looking for
[2:39:01.520 --> 2:39:04.720]  trouble it's defensive they're not out to attack and they
[2:39:04.720 --> 2:39:08.880]  understand the provocateurs they understand whoever shoots first loses
[2:39:08.880 --> 2:39:12.480]  but they're also ready that as the tyranny pushes them into a corner
[2:39:12.480 --> 2:39:16.480]  like lexington and concord they're going to stand up for their rights
[2:39:16.480 --> 2:39:20.240]  and then the establishment who are bullies will probably fire the first
[2:39:20.240 --> 2:39:23.120]  shot in the second american revolution and then all hell's going to break
[2:39:23.120 --> 2:39:24.640]  loose but do you think that's going to happen
[2:39:24.640 --> 2:39:28.720]  soon i would say it's 50 50 that in the next uh
[2:39:28.720 --> 2:39:32.720]  two years you will see the start of a real revolution in the united states
[2:39:32.720 --> 2:39:37.200]  uh a violent revolution in response to people being attacked
[2:39:37.200 --> 2:39:41.840]  well and pregnant mothers being tasered in cps kidnapping people's children
[2:39:41.840 --> 2:39:45.120]  and the whole prison economy just squeezing and pushing and pushing and
[2:39:45.120 --> 2:39:49.440]  never stopping but i'm fighting to stop that and to reach out to military and
[2:39:49.440 --> 2:39:52.640]  police and others you know ron paul got more contributions than any other
[2:39:52.640 --> 2:39:55.360]  presidential candidate in both parties from the military
[2:39:55.360 --> 2:40:00.640]  70 plus percent so the truth is uh these offshore banks that have hijacked our
[2:40:00.640 --> 2:40:03.680]  government and want to use the military and north com against us
[2:40:03.680 --> 2:40:08.240]  it's going to fail so you so what do you think that
[2:40:08.240 --> 2:40:11.840]  that the real militias as you as you call them the ones where they've got the
[2:40:11.840 --> 2:40:14.320]  four or five friends who go out and they practice what what are they
[2:40:14.320 --> 2:40:17.920]  preparing for what is it that they're not going to quarantines they're not
[2:40:17.920 --> 2:40:21.600]  letting anybody take their children they're not taking forced inoculations
[2:40:21.600 --> 2:40:24.880]  they're not going to uh be forced on government welfare and as the
[2:40:24.880 --> 2:40:28.160]  establishment shuts the economy down by design
[2:40:28.160 --> 2:40:32.080]  and enforces people under cc they're advertising the camps
[2:40:32.080 --> 2:40:34.960]  as if they're a good thing they're advertising it as if it's going to be a
[2:40:34.960 --> 2:40:37.280]  community center just like hitler did or just like
[2:40:37.280 --> 2:40:40.400]  stalling it but let me just read you before i play this fbi video and then
[2:40:40.400 --> 2:40:43.440]  we'll come back and i'll do a whole rant you can ask any questions you want on
[2:40:43.440 --> 2:40:47.120]  air if that's what you that's what you'd like
[2:40:47.120 --> 2:40:51.520]  the gadston flag is a historical american flag with a yellow field depicting a
[2:40:51.520 --> 2:40:55.360]  rattlesnake coiled and ready to strike position below
[2:40:55.360 --> 2:41:00.080]  the snake is the legend don't tread on me the flag was designed and is named after
[2:41:00.080 --> 2:41:05.520]  American general and statesman christopher gadston it was also used by
[2:41:05.520 --> 2:41:09.680]  the united states marine corps as early
[2:41:09.680 --> 2:41:12.720]  don't forget her mic guys
[2:41:12.960 --> 2:41:16.720]  the flag was designed and it's named after american general
[2:41:16.720 --> 2:41:21.360]  and statesman christopher gadston it was also used by the united states marine
[2:41:21.360 --> 2:41:25.280]  corps as an early motto flag
[2:41:25.280 --> 2:41:29.000]  So it must be bad. And then this is the flag that Homeland Security in the report says
[2:41:29.000 --> 2:41:32.960]  it's so deadly, so evil, so horrible, even though the army and the Marine Corps, everybody
[2:41:32.960 --> 2:41:33.960]  else uses it.
[2:41:33.960 --> 2:41:39.240]  So I thought people should actually find out what it means. As the American Revolution
[2:41:39.240 --> 2:41:44.360]  grew closer, the snake began to see more use as a symbol of the colonies. In 1774, Paul
[2:41:44.360 --> 2:41:49.740]  Revere added it to the title of his paper, The Massachusetts Spy, as a snake joined to
[2:41:49.740 --> 2:41:54.720]  fight the British dragon. In December of 1775, Benjamin Franklin published an essay in the
[2:41:54.720 --> 2:42:00.600]  Pennsylvania Journal under the pseudonym American Gosser, in which he suggested that the rattlesnake
[2:42:00.600 --> 2:42:08.120]  was a good symbol for the American spirit. I recollect that her eyes excelled in brightness
[2:42:08.120 --> 2:42:12.760]  than that of any other animal, and that she has no eyelids. She may therefore be esteemed
[2:42:12.760 --> 2:42:21.420]  as an emblem of vigilance. She never begins an attack, nor, when once engaged, ever surrenders.
[2:42:21.420 --> 2:42:26.800]  She is therefore an emblem of magnanimity and true courage, as if anxious to prevent
[2:42:26.800 --> 2:42:32.560]  all pretensions of quarreling with her, the weapon which nature has furnished her, she
[2:42:32.560 --> 2:42:37.920]  conceals in the roof of her mouth, so that to those who are unacquainted with her, she
[2:42:37.920 --> 2:42:43.480]  appears to be most defenseless animal. And even when those weapons are shown and extended
[2:42:43.480 --> 2:42:51.360]  for her defense, they appear weak and contemptible. But their wounds, however small, are decisive,
[2:42:51.360 --> 2:42:58.680]  and fatal. Conscious of this, she never wounds till she has generously given notice, even
[2:42:58.680 --> 2:43:04.160]  to her enemy, and cautioned him against the danger of treading on her. Was I wrong, sir,
[2:43:04.160 --> 2:43:08.880]  in thinking that this is a strong picture of the temper of American conduct? So that
[2:43:08.880 --> 2:43:15.920]  is what the terrorist, Benjamin Franklin, had to say about the Gadsden flag. And why
[2:43:15.920 --> 2:43:25.360]  do I say terrorist? I have FEMA on video from 2000 shot by a firefighter in Kansas City.
[2:43:25.360 --> 2:43:28.640]  In the training seminar, and we've seen the training manual itself, this is the only time
[2:43:28.640 --> 2:43:34.080]  we were sent it being taught, said that the founding fathers are terrorists, George Washington,
[2:43:34.080 --> 2:43:41.320]  Thomas Jefferson, they're terrorists, America's bad, these are the enemies of the federal government.
[2:43:41.320 --> 2:43:46.560]  And so we broke that as well. But a world exclusive right now, this was sent to us,
[2:43:46.560 --> 2:43:53.960]  this is a 2006, Quantico terrorist training video. This was sent to us by someone saying
[2:43:53.960 --> 2:43:59.160]  they were the FBI. We've called the FBI, confirmed this is one of their training videos, but
[2:43:59.160 --> 2:44:04.200]  this is not on the web. First time it's ever been seen. Your taxpayer money paid for this,
[2:44:04.200 --> 2:44:09.120]  paranoia, this induced schizophrenia to show police, military, they're now involved in
[2:44:09.120 --> 2:44:13.960]  law enforcement illegally and the FBI, that everyone's a terrorist. And that's why when
[2:44:13.960 --> 2:44:18.840]  you're with your family, photographing the Washington Monument, police come over and
[2:44:18.840 --> 2:44:24.560]  ask why you're doing it. As if terrorists, real terrorists that weren't CIA or MI6 wouldn't
[2:44:24.560 --> 2:44:28.640]  go and just look at Google Earth or have a hidden camera. It's ridiculous. It's about
[2:44:28.640 --> 2:44:33.440]  training you that you're a terrorist. And the FBI is now saying they want to put TSA
[2:44:33.440 --> 2:44:37.360]  screeners in shopping malls and metal detectors, and they want to have them on street corners
[2:44:37.360 --> 2:44:41.960]  and viper teams with the federal marshals are out running checkpoints in Houston and
[2:44:41.960 --> 2:44:46.800]  Boston and New York and searching all the subway bags. The Amtrak trains were being
[2:44:46.800 --> 2:44:52.280]  trained to be prisoners. This is all part of a process of enslavement here in the managed
[2:44:52.280 --> 2:44:57.880]  economy. So here it is the next two segments. Let's just go ahead and play this Orwellian
[2:44:57.880 --> 2:45:04.000]  FBI internal training video, which is federalizing local police. Here it is. Important information
[2:45:04.000 --> 2:45:10.280]  on terrorists and their allies and a terrorist screening center stands ready to help you.
[2:45:10.280 --> 2:45:15.720]  Before TSC was created in December 2003, the cop on the street had no way of knowing if
[2:45:15.720 --> 2:45:22.360]  someone he'd stopped was associated with terrorism. But now TSC consolidates the terrorist lists
[2:45:22.360 --> 2:45:29.960]  of many agencies and you connect to them automatically through NCIC. Whenever you run an NCIC name
[2:45:29.960 --> 2:45:34.760]  checked, you connect with TSC and running any name that's on our watch list will automatically
[2:45:34.760 --> 2:45:38.800]  give you a hit and some specific instructions on how to handle that person.
[2:45:38.800 --> 2:45:41.800]  Alright, and call us right there.
[2:45:41.800 --> 2:45:48.640]  Okay, now this is meant to, again, get the police not into responding to crime when
[2:45:48.640 --> 2:45:52.000]  it's happened, because the police will tell you it's not their job to protect you. They
[2:45:52.000 --> 2:45:56.040]  have no liability. They're going to respond and enforce the law because they're elected
[2:45:56.040 --> 2:46:00.760]  by the municipal governments that are chartered for the local people under state law. But
[2:46:00.760 --> 2:46:03.920]  this is about the police thinking everybody's a terrorist. That's why everybody that gets
[2:46:03.920 --> 2:46:10.080]  pulled over now, including my dad, you know, a 60-year-old doctor, gets asked, where you
[2:46:10.080 --> 2:46:16.160]  going? Are you a terrorist? Because the police have now been turned into these proactive commasars
[2:46:16.160 --> 2:46:19.600]  and now they're told, pull you over if you've got a Ron Paul sticker. My dad got pulled
[2:46:19.600 --> 2:46:25.200]  over and he's Texas driving back from visiting family and they walked over and they said,
[2:46:25.200 --> 2:46:30.240]  you come up in the watch list, you're the father of Alex Jones. And they're now dialing
[2:46:30.240 --> 2:46:34.160]  in to these databases. This was about a year and a half ago. And he said, how do you know
[2:46:34.160 --> 2:46:38.240]  this? He said, well, we have a Reuters system, Alexis Nexus. It all goes through this federal
[2:46:38.240 --> 2:46:44.000]  system. And the guy went ahead and told my dad he was a fan of the show, but just that
[2:46:44.000 --> 2:46:48.440]  the cameras, the feds have put in in their town, read his license plate and flagged it.
[2:46:48.440 --> 2:46:52.400]  Remember six years ago, every car that goes through Florida town has plates run. That's
[2:46:52.400 --> 2:46:56.280]  already nationwide. And as they bring in these threat integration centers, all your local
[2:46:56.280 --> 2:47:00.840]  police are now being told they have this. Also, I saw a story in 2004, it's in my film
[2:47:00.840 --> 2:47:05.520]  Matrix of Evil, an article in the Green Bay news with the governor saying, oh, look, the
[2:47:05.520 --> 2:47:10.360]  feds just put in the new system in our threat integration center where we, if we want to
[2:47:10.360 --> 2:47:13.840]  look for somebody, we type up the name of their cell phone, their number and it pops up in
[2:47:13.840 --> 2:47:19.480]  real time tracking them. Now they admit that the telecommunications act of 96 by law, October
[2:47:19.480 --> 2:47:24.800]  1st, 2001, passed in 96, all phones are GPS triangulated off the cell towers, tracked in
[2:47:24.800 --> 2:47:29.560]  real time. Now the local departments are phasing it in under federal control. They type in,
[2:47:29.560 --> 2:47:33.520]  they pull you up, they hit another key, turns the mic on on your phone. They're reducing
[2:47:33.520 --> 2:47:40.120]  into the slaves right now, the fluoride heads out there as, oh, if a child's lost, the police
[2:47:40.120 --> 2:47:45.160]  can dial in and listen. So they're also conditioning the police. So that's what this video is about.
[2:47:45.160 --> 2:47:50.240]  This is the feds fully turning the local police into secret police for the non-existent threat
[2:47:50.240 --> 2:47:55.200]  of terror when Oklahoma City 9-11 and every other major terror event, Gulf of Tonkin,
[2:47:55.200 --> 2:48:00.600]  Operation Ajax, Operation Northwoods, many of them declassified is staged terror. Declassified
[2:48:00.600 --> 2:48:05.440]  2004 Army Training Manual. We'll pull that up and show it to the media. Teaches the Army
[2:48:05.440 --> 2:48:10.120]  how to stage false flag terror attacks. Army captains and above are taught how to stage
[2:48:10.120 --> 2:48:16.680]  terror attacks in America. This is like canteen M16 terror attack manual. Carry out the terror.
[2:48:16.680 --> 2:48:22.320]  Oorah, let's go, bring down America. Now let's go back to the video of the real terrorist.
[2:48:22.320 --> 2:48:30.160]  Nated, what you should do ranges from clappin' in irons to let him walk. Category one is
[2:48:30.160 --> 2:48:35.240]  for the baddest of the bad. This is someone you should arrest immediately, just like you
[2:48:35.240 --> 2:48:42.000]  handle any other one. Then call TSC. Odds are you won't see any of these guys. Category
[2:48:42.000 --> 2:48:46.800]  two is for the people who may have died. I just can't help it. Odds are you won't see
[2:48:46.800 --> 2:48:53.320]  one. No kidding. It's now been declassified. We knew this five years ago when she was on
[2:48:53.320 --> 2:48:58.200]  the show, Sybil Edmonds, but under federal gag order she couldn't go fully public. FBI
[2:48:58.200 --> 2:49:03.440]  translator of NSA intercepts. And she said, look, drug running, child kidnapping, it's
[2:49:03.440 --> 2:49:08.160]  all CIA, all Al-Qaeda. Bin Laden works for us. That's all I can tell you. She told Congress
[2:49:08.160 --> 2:49:13.200]  this and was gagged. She now went and broke the federal gag order two weeks ago and said
[2:49:13.200 --> 2:49:19.560]  Al-Qaeda was under full U.S. control till 9-11. This is the intercept she's hearing.
[2:49:19.560 --> 2:49:24.200]  Wayne Madsen, investigative journalist, is now confirmed that they've got a whole NSA
[2:49:24.200 --> 2:49:29.200]  group just watching 9-11 whistleblowers in the government. So see again, of course you're
[2:49:29.200 --> 2:49:35.000]  not going to see level one. Clap them and irons immediately.
[2:49:35.000 --> 2:49:39.600]  Member Springman, the head of the Jeddah Embassy of Saudi Arabia, we had on, was also
[2:49:39.600 --> 2:49:43.960]  in the Toronto Star. He wouldn't let Mohammed Atta and others back from that Malaysian terror
[2:49:43.960 --> 2:49:50.120]  zone as they were flying back through the Middle East from Asia. And they told him, don't
[2:49:50.120 --> 2:49:54.640]  worry, their terror names are just their CIA covers. And then you had the head of the
[2:49:54.640 --> 2:50:00.680]  embassy in Canada also went public, not just in Saudi Arabia. And then Colonel Stephen
[2:50:00.680 --> 2:50:04.920]  Butler, the head of the Defense Language School went public in the San Jose Mercury
[2:50:04.920 --> 2:50:08.520]  News in AP and said, look, the government did this. They let this happen. These guys
[2:50:08.520 --> 2:50:15.520]  were trained at bases. I'm the dean of the school. I called him up and he said his life
[2:50:15.520 --> 2:50:19.200]  was being threatened. He couldn't talk. But the point is they started a court marshal until
[2:50:19.200 --> 2:50:23.040]  he agreed to shut up. This is all staged, ladies and gentlemen. I'm sorry. I said I
[2:50:23.040 --> 2:50:27.040]  get to the video quicker than this. It's just, it's so amazing. And then I'm going to go
[2:50:27.040 --> 2:50:32.320]  through this folder how the whole deal is staged. Just clan group, white supremacists,
[2:50:32.320 --> 2:50:39.000]  militias, all of it. It's staged. Any violent group. It's now coming out in congressional
[2:50:39.000 --> 2:50:44.160]  testimony about this. It's coming out in mainstream news in Colorado. Missouri's having state
[2:50:44.160 --> 2:50:49.640]  hearings about it. I mean, look at these cops dressed up like anarchists. Just look at them
[2:50:49.640 --> 2:50:54.240]  out there trying to get people to do illegal things in Missouri at the end of the Fed protest.
[2:50:54.240 --> 2:51:02.360]  We're on to you. We've caught you. It's over criminals.

[2:52:02.000 --> 2:52:06.080]  Our beloved republic is on her knees. The forces of globalism are destroying national
[2:52:06.080 --> 2:52:10.920]  sovereignty worldwide, but in liberty's darkest hour there is hope. The first time in modern
[2:52:10.920 --> 2:52:15.800]  history the people are beginning to wake up. It is essential that patriots worldwide accelerate
[2:52:15.800 --> 2:52:19.440]  their fellow man's understanding of the new world order master plan. We have a short
[2:52:19.440 --> 2:52:23.200]  time frame to fully awaken and energize the people to meet this threat.

[2:53:02.640 --> 2:53:06.400]  For years doctors and researchers have known that one of the major pathways to better health

[2:54:01.040 --> 2:54:10.480]  Okay, I said I was going to play this video and I'm just stopping it every five seconds
[2:54:10.480 --> 2:54:15.360]  because it's all such incredible propaganda. But this is the federalization, this is the
[2:54:15.360 --> 2:54:19.960]  takeover. Continue with the internal FBI training video that they also give to local
[2:54:19.960 --> 2:54:24.040]  police to brainwash and federalize them. Here it is.
[2:54:24.040 --> 2:54:29.640]  You should call TSC right away and you may be asked to detain them for a reasonable time.
[2:54:29.640 --> 2:54:33.280]  You probably won't see any of these people either.
[2:54:33.280 --> 2:54:39.680]  Category 3. If you get a hit, it'll most likely be a Category 3. These are people that may
[2:54:39.680 --> 2:54:45.920]  have ties to terrorism but don't know that we know and we want to keep it that way.
[2:54:45.920 --> 2:54:48.000]  So don't let them know that they're on a watch.
[2:54:48.000 --> 2:54:52.040]  See this is really training the local police to go out and be secret police. They don't
[2:54:52.040 --> 2:54:57.680]  want to make the public mad and know they've all been turned into secret police. Okay,
[2:54:57.680 --> 2:55:02.080]  and so again when they're harassing you and asking you questions, I mean I was sitting
[2:55:02.080 --> 2:55:07.320]  there paying a taxi cab to the airport and a TSA guy just came over and asked where I
[2:55:07.320 --> 2:55:11.320]  was from and how I was doing and it was all right out of this. And one time I was at the
[2:55:11.320 --> 2:55:14.680]  Austin airport and a guy was reading a book, looked like it was out of 1984 with a black
[2:55:14.680 --> 2:55:18.520]  and white cover saying how someone becomes a terrorist.
[2:55:18.520 --> 2:55:23.440]  See it's all part of the mental illness like the American people are now the Ruskies and
[2:55:23.440 --> 2:55:28.260]  it's the red terror and they're going to have to deal with this and we're hiding under
[2:55:28.260 --> 2:55:32.960]  every table and Al Qaeda is going to get us and there's white Al Qaeda. Remember years
[2:55:32.960 --> 2:55:36.320]  ago I told you they would announce white Al Qaeda when they were getting ready to focus
[2:55:36.320 --> 2:55:40.320]  Homeland Security on the American people, what it was built and designed and set up for
[2:55:40.320 --> 2:55:45.440]  and now they say there's between four and six thousand white Al Qaeda and the grandson
[2:55:45.440 --> 2:55:50.400]  of the ADL head, Adam Gadan who got a resident for beating up Muslims at Mosque. He suddenly
[2:55:50.400 --> 2:55:56.680]  is on TV, Allah Akbar and they upload his videos in the same video format and with the
[2:55:56.680 --> 2:56:02.400]  Intel Center bug in the same Al Qaeda bug in the same video layer and then it turns
[2:56:02.400 --> 2:56:09.240]  out the head of the Intel Center was the adjunct to Psyops at the CIA and works for Rumsfeld.
[2:56:09.240 --> 2:56:16.280]  Oh, I mean could it get more obvious? Let's continue with the video. Here it is.
[2:56:16.280 --> 2:56:22.360]  First order that you're calling TSC and don't let them hear the call. Basically you want
[2:56:22.360 --> 2:56:27.200]  to deal with them as you normally would without the hit. But ask probing questions to get
[2:56:27.200 --> 2:56:32.760]  positive ID. Obviously someone might have the same name as a guy on the list without
[2:56:32.760 --> 2:56:38.680]  actually being that guy. Category 4 is for other people who may have ties to terrorism
[2:56:38.680 --> 2:56:43.840]  but the connection is not a sure. So we want you to get positive ID info on them and then
[2:56:43.840 --> 2:56:47.360]  call TSC if you think they should be investigated for terrorist activity.
[2:56:47.360 --> 2:56:54.320]  Alright, pause right there. Level 4 is the only truthful designation. We have no evidence.
[2:56:54.320 --> 2:56:59.080]  We have no proof. No due process. They just might know somebody who knew somebody who
[2:56:59.080 --> 2:57:05.720]  one time knew somebody who might have fought and imagined in a dream about a terrorist.
[2:57:05.720 --> 2:57:10.880]  That's what all the other categories are too. But see by saying, oh, this is an unsubstantiated
[2:57:10.880 --> 2:57:18.080]  level 4, now that legitimizes level 1, 2, and 3. It's all quackery. Like they're saying,
[2:57:18.080 --> 2:57:23.000]  oh, if you're on the no fly list, 25,000 people a month added over 1.2 million since they
[2:57:23.000 --> 2:57:28.240]  made the list secret 8 months ago. If you're on that list, you can't fly and you can't
[2:57:28.240 --> 2:57:31.280]  own a gun and you're not going to be able to have a job, they're saying. And if you
[2:57:31.280 --> 2:57:34.760]  have bad credit, you're going to be on the no fly list. That's been announced. So it's
[2:57:34.760 --> 2:57:40.360]  this new no judge, no jury. You're just, your rights are over now. It's like Germany. They
[2:57:40.360 --> 2:57:44.200]  would just say, you got to have this mark on your papers saying you're a bad person.
[2:57:44.200 --> 2:57:48.200]  But now it's the mark of your face scan, your thumb print, your biometrics with the face
[2:57:48.200 --> 2:57:53.360]  scanning cameras, the license plate scanning cameras, your cell phone by federal law tracking
[2:57:53.360 --> 2:57:58.320]  everywhere you go. They can dial in even when it's off and listen to you all admit it. All
[2:57:58.320 --> 2:58:02.760]  admit it. This is the total Soviet Union of America. Let's take it out to break with
[2:58:02.760 --> 2:58:28.760]  more of the clip.
[2:58:28.760 --> 2:58:55.120]  This is Alex Jones. Have you heard of the millionaire patriot? Well, you should. He
[2:58:55.120 --> 2:59:00.440]  has a free handgun and five days of firearms training waiting for you. That's right. You
[2:59:00.440 --> 2:59:06.200]  can attend five days of world class gun training at front site firearms training Institute
[2:59:06.200 --> 2:59:10.880]  and secure a 30 state concealed weapons permit all for pennies on the dollar. Plus if you
[2:59:10.880 --> 2:59:16.080]  act fast, the millionaire patriot will give you a free Springfield Armory XD pistol in
[2:59:16.080 --> 2:59:19.880]  the caliber of your choice. I believe now is the time that you and your family need
[2:59:19.880 --> 2:59:24.800]  to be armed and trained to levels that exceed law enforcement and military standards. Front
[2:59:24.800 --> 2:59:30.280]  site provides such training without any boot camp mentality or drill instructor attitudes.
[2:59:30.280 --> 2:59:36.840]  This is real. Don't miss out. Secure a front site defensive handgun course plus a 30 state
[2:59:36.840 --> 2:59:41.920]  concealed weapons permit for pennies on the dollar and get your free handgun. Go to front
[2:59:41.920 --> 2:59:59.200]  site dot com today. That's f r o n t s i g h t dot com. Go to front site dot com for
[2:59:59.200 --> 3:00:25.200]  pennies. Ladies and gentlemen, just a heads up. We have a really huge guest. I'm just
[3:00:25.200 --> 3:00:29.640]  going to let you know that huge announcement Tuesday on the show. We're also getting Ron
[3:00:29.640 --> 3:00:35.760]  Paul next week. Talk about more evidence of these provocateurs. The feds and local police
[3:00:35.760 --> 3:00:40.720]  posing as anarchists come out and demonize in the Federal Reserve rallies. The private
[3:00:40.720 --> 3:00:45.760]  banks that control this country are really getting desperate. Holes show in Gallup 75
[3:00:45.760 --> 3:00:51.480]  percent growing. Want the Fed audited or abolished. So look for the feds to do a self
[3:00:51.480 --> 3:00:57.040]  inflicted wound. That's why if you see a federal building or the Federal Reserve, which isn't
[3:00:57.040 --> 3:01:01.560]  federal bond or something, start videotaping immediately. Get those feds on tape. We could
[3:01:01.560 --> 3:01:06.560]  bring them down with this. Follow these provocateurs. Go to end the Fed events. We got a lot of
[3:01:06.560 --> 3:01:11.520]  private investigators volunteering now. Go stake it out. Videotape the troublemakers.
[3:01:11.520 --> 3:01:15.960]  Follow them back to the police station. Follow them back to their handlers. Burn them good.
[3:01:15.960 --> 3:01:18.960]  We're burning them everywhere. We're going to continue to burn them. We're going to
[3:01:18.960 --> 3:01:25.560]  expose their terrorist activities, their false flag events. That is a staged terror attack.
[3:01:25.560 --> 3:01:29.800]  When the police attack other police and blame it on the good protesters as a way to shut
[3:01:29.800 --> 3:01:34.560]  down free speech in America. The beta test was Seattle 99. They do it over and over again
[3:01:34.560 --> 3:01:39.400]  worldwide. We blew their cover then. We're going to blow their cover now. You are the
[3:01:39.400 --> 3:01:44.360]  front line against the terrorist. You are the front line to expose the Army and Pentagon's
[3:01:44.360 --> 3:01:48.920]  black ops against this nation. We have people in the FBI. We have people in every other
[3:01:48.920 --> 3:01:53.560]  agency in the military. 70 plus percent of the donations for president went to Ron Paul
[3:01:53.560 --> 3:01:59.680]  from the military. We know you're good. These compartments that are carrying out the terror,
[3:01:59.680 --> 3:02:03.720]  they're going to do it under the guise of a federal drill. They always do. In case you
[3:02:03.720 --> 3:02:08.520]  catch them, they're going to say it's part of the drill. Play along. They'll kill you
[3:02:08.520 --> 3:02:14.400]  if they think you're about to expose their terror attack. So get the information, get
[3:02:14.400 --> 3:02:18.840]  out, get it out on YouTube, get it out on Google before they can kill you. If you don't
[3:02:18.840 --> 3:02:23.080]  do that, you're dead. This is how we defeat the new world order. This is how we bring
[3:02:23.080 --> 3:02:27.800]  their crimes to justice. We will not be stopped. These techniques of liberty and truth will
[3:02:27.800 --> 3:02:33.000]  defeat them. Back to the FBI, federalizing local police, turning them into secret police,
[3:02:33.000 --> 3:02:36.520]  teaching them that the American people are terrorists, that Ron Paul is a terrorist, that
[3:02:36.520 --> 3:02:40.160]  the founding fathers are terrorists. That's what the training manuals they give them with
[3:02:40.160 --> 3:02:46.840]  this video say. Here it is. This officer has just stopped this driver for driving 55 in
[3:02:46.840 --> 3:02:51.560]  a 40 mile an hour zone. He ran the car's plate before approaching, then got the driver's
[3:02:51.560 --> 3:02:56.640]  license and car registration. When he ran them through NCIC, the driver's name gave
[3:02:56.640 --> 3:03:02.400]  a category three hit from TSC saying he might be connected to terrorism. So how does our
[3:03:02.400 --> 3:03:07.240]  officer handle the news? The way you should watch.
[3:03:07.240 --> 3:03:11.560]  Is this the terrorist screening center?
[3:03:11.560 --> 3:03:12.560]  Good pause.
[3:03:12.560 --> 3:03:19.080]  That little psychological thing they do is to make it look like it's interactive. You
[3:03:19.080 --> 3:03:23.200]  know, to CNN and Fox are going to this computer internet look now as if you're interactive
[3:03:23.200 --> 3:03:27.600]  because their studies and focus groups have shown that your psychological algorithm likes
[3:03:27.600 --> 3:03:31.320]  surfing the web more. They realize it's all going to that. So they want to put you in
[3:03:31.320 --> 3:03:37.640]  a passive web psychology. So by turning up the volume, it makes you feel like you're
[3:03:37.640 --> 3:03:44.000]  in control. Okay, because the experience psychologically of being in control is better with the internet.
[3:03:44.000 --> 3:03:48.120]  So they're trying to mimic that and also make it look like at a primitive level like this
[3:03:48.120 --> 3:03:51.720]  guy's a witch doctor. Your subconscious mind sees it that way, that he knows how to do
[3:03:51.720 --> 3:03:57.720]  something real cool like turn the audio up. Again, all psychological warfare by these
[3:03:57.720 --> 3:04:02.880]  psychops engineers. Once you understand their operation can totally defeat them. We'll go
[3:04:02.880 --> 3:04:05.240]  out to break with more of the video. Here it is.
[3:04:05.240 --> 3:04:10.880]  Driver's name gave a category three hit through NCIC. I was advised to call you.
[3:04:10.880 --> 3:04:16.320]  And that's the name of that song. Call TSC. The screeners there can help you know for
[3:04:16.320 --> 3:04:21.360]  sure if the guy you stopped is really the guy on the list. And even if he's an exact
[3:04:21.360 --> 3:04:26.440]  match, he may not be a terrorist. Some of the people we're interested in are associates
[3:04:26.440 --> 3:04:30.800]  or supporters under investigation because they're affiliated with terrorism.
[3:04:30.800 --> 3:04:31.880]  Hit pause.
[3:04:31.880 --> 3:04:33.480]  Since this is a category.
[3:04:33.480 --> 3:04:37.840]  Did you hear that? That is the absolute key to all of this. When you look at all these
[3:04:37.840 --> 3:04:44.120]  federal reports about environmental activists, anti-war activists, the army spying domestically
[3:04:44.120 --> 3:04:52.560]  illegally on mainline anti-war pro life pro choice groups, everybody gets spied on by
[3:04:52.560 --> 3:04:57.840]  this corrupt system. And they're saying you're all affiliated with terrorists. Gun owners,
[3:04:57.840 --> 3:05:01.640]  veterans, everybody's a terrorist. Well, they're right back.
[3:05:01.640 --> 3:05:06.200]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions. If you're going into a battle and
[3:05:06.200 --> 3:05:10.840]  they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want? My answer would be

[3:05:21.240 --> 3:05:25.840]  When will you need it? Can you buy it without proper identification? Will there be any food?
[3:05:25.840 --> 3:05:29.880]  Will it make your children sick? If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself,
[3:05:29.880 --> 3:05:34.160]  will you go to the gathering center and be immunized? You wipe out all these problems

[3:05:39.360 --> 3:05:44.160]  life. How much will you need? We don't know. How much do you want? All you can get. I'm

[3:06:09.320 --> 3:06:14.400]  that makes you sick? Go to the doctor and buy their drugs? You don't have to cooperate.

[3:08:02.320 --> 3:08:20.000]  Please the T-Rex of political talk. Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[3:08:20.000 --> 3:08:25.960]  Okay folks, we're now going to go back to the video and here is the key. I know Kurt
[3:08:25.960 --> 3:08:29.600]  Nemo and Paul Watts and everybody's gonna write articles on this and I really think
[3:08:29.600 --> 3:08:41.480]  the headline should be, you know, restricted FBI training video, shows, police being indoctrinated
[3:08:41.480 --> 3:08:47.560]  that general public are terrorist or some similar headline because they're saying here,
[3:08:47.560 --> 3:08:50.880]  oh, go ahead and pull people over, ask them questions, why are there millions of people
[3:08:50.880 --> 3:08:51.880]  on the list?
[3:08:51.880 --> 3:08:55.680]  Well, they might know a terrorist or be supporters of terrorists and what have they said? They
[3:08:55.680 --> 3:09:02.000]  said if you are anti-war, remember the deputy attorney general back in 2003, I'll never
[3:09:02.000 --> 3:09:09.320]  forget this, his last name was Calhoun, was in the Oakland Tribune and this was quotes
[3:09:09.320 --> 3:09:16.040]  from a press conference and he said, all protesting is banned in California against the war because
[3:09:16.040 --> 3:09:23.400]  the war, and he was a Democrat, that was the mind control Bush had at that time. He said
[3:09:23.400 --> 3:09:28.920]  because the war is against al-Qaeda and so protesting the war is aiding al-Qaeda and
[3:09:28.920 --> 3:09:36.160]  that's why when it came out that people protesting Halliburton in Houston had army intelligence
[3:09:36.160 --> 3:09:41.360]  and groups assigned to the NSA and CIA spying on them and these were groups that went out
[3:09:41.360 --> 3:09:48.920]  front, Halliburton and handed out cookies to workers. So groups with no criminal records.
[3:09:48.920 --> 3:09:55.840]  In fact, it came out in New York that the CIA was advising the FBI on critical mass,
[3:09:55.840 --> 3:10:00.720]  the bike riding group. See, the CIA does revolutions all over the world and companies it wants
[3:10:00.720 --> 3:10:01.720]  to overthrow.
[3:10:01.720 --> 3:10:05.760]  So it recognizes, my God, there's people saying bikes have rights and they're getting together
[3:10:05.760 --> 3:10:11.000]  and it's spreading, set them up, beat them up. So the FBI advised the CIA all over the
[3:10:11.000 --> 3:10:15.320]  East Coast, you've seen the videos online, would just come up and tackle and order the
[3:10:15.320 --> 3:10:20.920]  police to beat up women and teenagers and people and just arrest them for riding their
[3:10:20.920 --> 3:10:21.920]  bikes.
[3:10:21.920 --> 3:10:26.800]  That people won't believe us. Just Google critical mass beat up, shows cops just T-boning, tackling
[3:10:26.800 --> 3:10:31.200]  people, slamming heads in concrete, blood all over the place. All CIA run because they
[3:10:31.200 --> 3:10:34.120]  were scared, they're like, my God, people are getting together riding bikes, beat the
[3:10:34.120 --> 3:10:38.240]  hell out of them right now. Because again, they engineer fake revolutions and they know
[3:10:38.240 --> 3:10:41.920]  a real one when they see it. So how are they going to demonize that? They're going to stage
[3:10:41.920 --> 3:10:44.680]  terror attacks, they're going to say militias did it, they're going to create fake militia
[3:10:44.680 --> 3:10:48.720]  groups, they're going to provocateur and go find unstable people to carry out terror
[3:10:48.720 --> 3:10:52.760]  or carry out shootings. They are going to radicalize and we're going to go over that
[3:10:52.760 --> 3:10:53.760]  evidence coming up.
[3:10:53.760 --> 3:10:58.120]  But let's go back to the video where he's saying people are on the terror watch list
[3:10:58.120 --> 3:11:05.160]  because they're supporters of terrorist and they're now saying if you are anti-war in
[3:11:05.160 --> 3:11:10.120]  any way, you're not going to fly, you're not going to own a gun, no fly, no buy, that's
[3:11:10.120 --> 3:11:14.280]  the new bill. The attorney general says he doesn't care if it doesn't pass. Eric Holder
[3:11:14.280 --> 3:11:18.160]  is just going to say you can't own guns and suddenly people I talk to, veterans, people
[3:11:18.160 --> 3:11:21.720]  with no criminal record, retired cops can't get guns. They go, sorry, I can't tell you
[3:11:21.720 --> 3:11:28.320]  why you're on the list. No judge, no jury, total tyranny overnight. Here's the video.
[3:11:28.320 --> 3:11:32.400]  So how does our officer handle the news? The way you should. Watch.
[3:11:32.400 --> 3:11:41.640]  Is this the terror screening center? Yeah, I just made a traffic stop and the driver's
[3:11:41.640 --> 3:11:47.320]  name gave a category three hit through NCIC. I was advised to call you. And that's the
[3:11:47.320 --> 3:11:53.120]  name of that song. Call TSC. The screeners there can help you know for sure if the guy
[3:11:53.120 --> 3:11:58.240]  you stopped is really the guy on the list. And even if he's an exact match, he may not
[3:11:58.240 --> 3:12:04.760]  be a terrorist. Some of the people we're interested in are associates or supporters under investigation
[3:12:04.760 --> 3:12:10.800]  because they're affiliated with terrorism. Since this is a category three hit, the officer
[3:12:10.800 --> 3:12:15.320]  should collect information on both these people, but not let them know that law enforcement
[3:12:15.320 --> 3:12:23.080]  is interested in them for terrorism. So where are you coming from? Our home. Is that your
[3:12:23.080 --> 3:12:41.960]  wife? Uh, girlfriend. Ma'am, can I see some ID, please? Thank you. Next step, run the
[3:12:41.960 --> 3:12:50.000]  passenger's name. Name check on Kovac, Kilo Oscar Victor, Alpha Charlie Kilo, Karen Common
[3:12:50.000 --> 3:12:58.120]  Spelling, D.O.B. 1983, 0409. With category three or four hits, you won't make any arrest
[3:12:58.120 --> 3:13:08.400]  that you wouldn't have otherwise. 217, no wants, no warrants. 217, 10-4. Since the results
[3:13:08.400 --> 3:13:12.400]  for the passenger were negative, the officer finishes his normal business for the traffic
[3:13:12.400 --> 3:13:18.120]  stop. Your signature is not an admission of guilt. It just certifies that your mailing
[3:13:18.120 --> 3:13:22.880]  address is correct. All the other instructions are on the form. Of course, he's going to
[3:13:22.880 --> 3:13:27.400]  keep his eyes open for anything interesting or unusual in the car. That would include
[3:13:27.400 --> 3:13:33.600]  cameras, binoculars, video equipment, GPS, maybe things like sleeping bags that suggest
[3:13:33.600 --> 3:13:37.560]  we're going to have to go. All right, let's stop right there. Remember all the articles
[3:13:37.560 --> 3:13:41.920]  where it said a road almond acts a sign of terror? The Texas report put out by the feds.
[3:13:41.920 --> 3:13:45.840]  The feds right at the state puts it out said wearing blue jeans, having a cell phone. In
[3:13:45.840 --> 3:13:50.000]  New York, it was a woman with a baby and a baby carriage. A man is a priest. The message
[3:13:50.000 --> 3:13:55.000]  is everyone's a terrorist. All this done in the name of fighting 19 guys directed from
[3:13:55.000 --> 3:13:59.400]  a cave in Afghanistan. Now they admit, no, North common homeland security is for the
[3:13:59.400 --> 3:14:05.320]  American people. Their own reports. See overnight, it's you, you're the terrorist. And they're
[3:14:05.320 --> 3:14:10.680]  saying sleeping bags, binoculars, anybody on a road trip. And see, then they say that's
[3:14:10.680 --> 3:14:16.840]  now probable cause to search your car. I mean, this is all just training you to be a slave
[3:14:16.840 --> 3:14:21.720]  and then teaching these cops that these are all excuses to go after you. And then of course
[3:14:21.720 --> 3:14:25.920]  in the video, then later, you know, the people that are have suspicious stuff are guilty.
[3:14:25.920 --> 3:14:29.720]  So it also creates the false perception that people are guilty. Let's continue with the
[3:14:29.720 --> 3:14:38.360]  brainwashing with the stop concluded and the suspects on their way and the suspects on
[3:14:38.360 --> 3:14:45.480]  their way. The officer will talk to the terrorist screening center once again. This time, this
[3:14:45.480 --> 3:14:55.680]  time, you'll give them all the info we gathered on the car and the two people and TSC may
[3:14:55.680 --> 3:15:02.880]  connect them with CT watch as well. And with that, he's done. Now let's take a look at
[3:15:02.880 --> 3:15:10.600]  another call where you might meet someone on the list. The suspicious person call. See
[3:15:10.600 --> 3:15:17.920]  way down there. There's a woman taking photos of the dam. Someone called 911 and reported
[3:15:17.920 --> 3:15:32.440]  a suspicious person. Our officer took the call and is just arriving on the scene. 217.
[3:15:32.440 --> 3:15:36.680]  I'm at the Smith Lake Dam. I have a white female in her twenties taking photos near
[3:15:36.680 --> 3:15:48.320]  the spillway. All of you know how to interview someone. So let's fast forward. We'll pick
[3:15:48.320 --> 3:15:57.360]  it up after he's heard her story and gotten her ID. Lima Alpha November, Alpha Tango Alpha,
[3:15:57.360 --> 3:16:07.880]  just named Maria. Middle initial a D. O. B. 1977 07 13 1977 07 13. As you guessed, she's
[3:16:07.880 --> 3:16:12.440]  gonna be a category three hit. And since it's very important that we don't let her know
[3:16:12.440 --> 3:16:17.600]  that we know both the dispatcher and the officer need to make sure she doesn't hear the radio
[3:16:17.600 --> 3:16:35.800]  traffic. I can ask you to wait right here, please. What our young lady won't be able
[3:16:35.800 --> 3:16:41.720]  to hear is the dispatcher telling the officer that she may be associated with terrorism
[3:16:41.720 --> 3:16:46.680]  and that he should get information to make a positive match. Dispatch is also giving
[3:16:46.680 --> 3:16:53.280]  him the number to call for the terrorist screening center. Would you say you were taking those
[3:16:53.280 --> 3:16:58.800]  photo classes at Stafford Community College to get anybody's permission to shoot here?
[3:16:58.800 --> 3:17:03.560]  I didn't think I'd need anyone's permission to take a couple of photographs. Please wait
[3:17:03.560 --> 3:17:09.640]  right here and don't take any more photographs. Hit pause for a minute. We notice how he keeps
[3:17:09.640 --> 3:17:15.160]  his eye on her and backs away like she's a 800 foot cobra dripping acid out of its fangs.
[3:17:15.160 --> 3:17:18.960]  So all of this goes on and that's why anywhere you are in the country cops come over while
[3:17:18.960 --> 3:17:22.400]  you're taking pictures of your kids and say don't take photos. It's about hin pecking
[3:17:22.400 --> 3:17:26.480]  us, letting us know we're slaves. While they put cameras on us, surveil everything we're
[3:17:26.480 --> 3:17:33.000]  doing, micromanage our lives. Again, this is about turning the military industrial complex
[3:17:33.000 --> 3:17:38.680]  loose on us, teaching the police and military we are the enemy because their business is
[3:17:38.680 --> 3:17:44.040]  war. Their business is control. No more free market, no more car manufacturing, no more
[3:17:44.040 --> 3:17:51.560]  semiconductor manufacturing. The tuition that's being paid for, the grants people are getting,
[3:17:51.560 --> 3:17:59.080]  the scholarships, it's all about spying and data mining and when you rent a car, buy food,
[3:17:59.080 --> 3:18:03.320]  everything's being looked at, everything's being tracked. It's disgusting. It's a giant
[3:18:03.320 --> 3:18:08.520]  panopticon prison grid. Back to the federal brainwashing video. Because of course it turns
[3:18:08.520 --> 3:18:09.520]  out he's a terrorist.
[3:18:09.520 --> 3:18:18.520]  Get a TSC on his cell phone and talk to one of the screeners there who will determine if this woman is really the one we're interested in or just someone else with the same name.
[3:18:18.520 --> 3:18:29.520]  Get pause there. See the feds know that a lot of people are listening with scanners, though with federal grants they're going to radio systems that scanners can't pick up, that are scrambled, descramblers, scramble, descramblers.
[3:18:29.520 --> 3:18:38.520]  So notice they tell the slave, the minion who's sledding his own family's throat going with the foreign bankers, they tell the cops be sure to use a cell phone when you call it into the feds.
[3:18:38.520 --> 3:18:53.520]  You know, don't use any of the other lines. Don't use the radio. Don't relay it through the dispatcher. Use your cell. Don't talk to your locals. Get a relationship with the feds going. You don't talk to dispatch anymore. You work for the feds.
[3:18:53.520 --> 3:19:19.520]  If you're a good officer, we'll teach you how to ship heroin and cocaine in. Let's continue with the video.
[3:19:19.520 --> 3:19:47.520]  We've got 40 minutes left. I want to take a few phone calls. I also want to go through some of the history of provocateurs and government staging terror and what's happening with the militia movement right now.
[3:19:47.520 --> 3:20:01.520]  The establishment is desperate to provocateurs and violent action. That's all coming up after this quick break in the final 40 minutes. Infowars.com is the website.
[3:20:01.520 --> 3:20:17.520]  On September 11th, 2001, along with hundreds of my fellow troops, I went to grounds here and we knew what to do. At least we thought we did.
[3:20:17.520 --> 3:20:26.520]  Whitman, EPA director on the 18th made a statement that the air was safe to breathe.
[3:20:26.520 --> 3:20:33.520]  This film follows the growing momentum of 9-Eleven Truth as brave souls throughout the world take action against their global masters.
[3:20:33.520 --> 3:20:42.520]  He had his hand over the radio while he was getting a countdown. He takes his hand off in year three, two, one, and it was boom, boom, boom, boom, boom.
[3:20:42.520 --> 3:21:00.520]  This is an emergency transmission worldwide. Download Truth Rising at prisonplanet.tv and aggressively spread it worldwide or order the DVD at infowars.com. If we don't expose the government-sponsored terror, they're going to commit more acts and bring in martial law.
[3:21:00.520 --> 3:21:15.520]  Good day. Jim Newcomer from Minus Resources. September 1st, 2009. Gold opened this morning at 9.51.10. A one-ounce gold coin can be purchased for 9.78.28, 4.89.14 for a half ounce, or 2.44.57 for a quarter ounce.
[3:21:15.520 --> 3:21:20.520]  That's 9.78.28, 4.89.14, or 2.44.57.
[3:21:20.520 --> 3:21:34.520]  How is it that we, the people, grow the cotton, weave it into fabric, engrave the ink, embed the strips and fibers that protect it from counterfeit, then cart the money off to a privately owned bank to have it lent back to us at interest, forcing us to pay taxes to service the debt?
[3:21:34.520 --> 3:21:43.520]  Is this capitalism, or was Jefferson correct when he said, a central bank issuing a public currency is a greater menace to the liberties of the people than a standing army?
[3:21:43.520 --> 3:21:52.520]  Hi, Ted Anderson. I'm placing a silver dollar inside of a book that explains how the monetary system works. Call for your copy 1-800-686-2237.
[3:21:52.520 --> 3:22:00.520]  Isn't it time to understand the system? Call 800-686-2237. That's 800-686-2237.

[3:23:00.520 --> 3:23:17.520]  There's a guy named MZ in Santa Cruz, California who owns one of our affiliate radio stations. He got laid off from a job he loved many years ago. He was devastated, but it taught him a lesson very early in life that even when you do a great job for someone and your boss tells you how much he appreciates you every day, there is no job security.
[3:23:17.520 --> 3:23:36.520]  You are always in danger of losing your job unless you take charge of your livelihood and own your own business. Since you are the boss, nobody can fire you. So MZ has been his own boss for over 37 years and he is passionate about turning other people on to the joys and benefits of working for themselves and not for others.
[3:23:36.520 --> 3:23:47.520]  MZ wants to tell you about a low-cost home business opportunity involving the marketing of helpful dark chocolate that can help people lose weight and set you up with an impressive compounding monthly income.
[3:23:47.520 --> 3:24:14.520]  Visit chocolate.ownmyself.com and check out the opportunity. That's chocolate.ownmyself.com. It takes very little money and if you're interested, MZ wants to talk to you. Remember chocolate.ownmyself.com.
[3:24:14.520 --> 3:24:24.520]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, we are live. Thank you so much for joining us. I want to take a few calls right now and then I'm going to get back into the history of government provocaturing.
[3:24:24.520 --> 3:24:45.520]  How the government does it just provocateur, they create and they command the white supremacists, the black supremacists, the Mecha, the Laraza, which means for our race, everything, those outside the race, nothing, the race. To get everybody fighting with each other, all the big offshore banks basically rule over us and play us off against each other.
[3:24:45.520 --> 3:24:56.520]  But we had a police officer send us some info. He gives us his name, but I don't want to give it on air. I'll make it him to pop in in a minute. I'm a Lieutenant and a large sheriff's office in Florida.
[3:24:56.520 --> 3:25:07.520]  I had to show that video to all my roll calls approximately two months ago. Good job of bringing it out. Mark. And let's see if we can get Mark on a line without using his full name just to pop in.
[3:25:07.520 --> 3:25:19.520]  We do have some other police officers calling in and former police officers, but let's talk to Steven New York quickly saying an officer gave him in game my film about the world population reduction plan from their own words.
[3:25:19.520 --> 3:25:31.520]  So again, the police were getting reports confirmed to them handing out my films everywhere. So we don't want to be enemies with the police. They're starting to wake up to what's happening and the Hitlers that run this country are in a lot of trouble.
[3:25:31.520 --> 3:25:38.520]  Kirk in London will get to you after we talk to Steven Hollis. Okay, Steven New York, you're on the air. Go ahead.
[3:25:38.520 --> 3:25:50.520]  Yes, hello, sir. I met an ESU officer in New York. It's an emergency service unit. He's the epitome of a jackboothed thug, as we'd say.
[3:25:50.520 --> 3:26:04.520]  And I met him and I was going to give him a copy of the bomb deception. He's my friend and my father-in-law and I'm talking to him and he had copies of Endgame and all your movies in his pocket and all of his team.
[3:26:04.520 --> 3:26:12.520]  This was the elite unit in New York City police and he's high up there and they all are on board, which I was like very ecstatic about.
[3:26:12.520 --> 3:26:18.520]  So you're saying you're saying one of the most elite teams in New York City and folks.
[3:26:18.520 --> 3:26:22.520]  Emergency services unit. You can look it up.
[3:26:22.520 --> 3:26:32.520]  Well, when I would, just to back this up, when I would go to 9-11 events five, six years ago, we'd have cops trying to trip us, firemen yelling at us, maybe half of them.
[3:26:32.520 --> 3:26:40.520]  The other half saying, good job, good job. Now, when I go to 9-11 events in the last two years, the cops are buying us food. They're slapping us on the back.
[3:26:40.520 --> 3:26:45.520]  Commanders are going like you, Alex Jones. We've even got a few clips of this and they'll go, I don't want to be on camera.
[3:26:45.520 --> 3:26:52.520]  I mean, were the cops basically almost carrying us on their shoulders in New York because we show them all the footage of the police saying, get back.
[3:26:52.520 --> 3:26:55.520]  The government's going to blow up Building 7 and that's their own officers.
[3:26:55.520 --> 3:27:01.520]  We interview the cops that say they blow up the towers. So the other cops found out about this and then instantly they're all waking up.
[3:27:01.520 --> 3:27:07.520]  So you're saying he was totally on board with the New World Order and now he has all the films.
[3:27:07.520 --> 3:27:11.520]  These are the guys in the black uniforms. That's what I'm saying. These are the guys in the black uniforms.
[3:27:11.520 --> 3:27:15.520]  The Hercules teams. Yes, yes.
[3:27:15.520 --> 3:27:18.520]  And so what were they saying? What were they saying?
[3:27:18.520 --> 3:27:22.520]  They were saying, well, I'm talking to one individual.
[3:27:22.520 --> 3:27:25.520]  I mean, you were saying that he was saying the whole unit's alive.
[3:27:25.520 --> 3:27:36.520]  He's a high ranking officer in that unit, that's what I'm saying, but his team is on board and I tried to approach him very softly because I didn't know how he came out.
[3:27:36.520 --> 3:27:42.520]  So give him like Papa Obama section. He's got Endgame. He's got wrote the tear in his pocket. He's giving it to me.
[3:27:42.520 --> 3:27:46.520]  And he said, hey, buddy, I don't need that video. I got Alex Jones videos right here.
[3:27:46.520 --> 3:27:51.520]  And to give me Endgame, I already saw Endgame. You know, I try to open them up a little bit, you know, when I meet somebody.
[3:27:51.520 --> 3:27:56.520]  It's unbelievable. We're making history. Thanks to people like you out there. Anything else, Steve?
[3:27:56.520 --> 3:27:59.520]  Uh, some better docs.
[3:27:59.520 --> 3:28:03.520]  Good to hear from you. Hollis is a former SWAT team member from Indiana.
[3:28:03.520 --> 3:28:07.520]  We're just taking random calls here and we've got the folks calling in about this.
[3:28:07.520 --> 3:28:10.520]  Hollis, what's your point today, sir?
[3:28:10.520 --> 3:28:15.520]  Yes, sir. I just wanted to say I've been listening to you for years since 2001.
[3:28:15.520 --> 3:28:25.520]  I actually found out about you through David Ike and I was a former SWAT team member here in Indiana and you guys woke me up.
[3:28:25.520 --> 3:28:39.520]  You woke me up. I became conscious and I was one of those guys that, like I heard an actor say in a movie, I would have jumped a speeding motorcycle over a train for any kind of, you know, that kind of stuff.
[3:28:39.520 --> 3:28:48.520]  And I woke up. I found out that there is a cabal in this country that has taken over our country.
[3:28:48.520 --> 3:28:58.520]  And I have turned several offices onto your information. They weren't aware of what's going on in this country.
[3:28:58.520 --> 3:29:12.520]  And it's unbelievable. The country I grew up in that we're supposed to look out for people's rights and we're doing the exact opposite.
[3:29:12.520 --> 3:29:18.520]  Well, then people hoped, landed a free, you know.
[3:29:18.520 --> 3:29:25.520]  Absolutely. Well, people hoped that Obama would fix that. Now they're finding out people hoped Bush would fix what Clinton did and they hoped Obama would fix what Bush is doing.
[3:29:25.520 --> 3:29:34.520]  They're just front men's and puppets. And what did you think of the last guy calling in about that unit of police waking up?
[3:29:34.520 --> 3:29:46.520]  Yes. Yes, it's a few officers I've spoken to. And like I said, they're waking up and recently with this flu vaccine thing.
[3:29:46.520 --> 3:29:51.520]  Stay there. I want to hear about that. I want to hear about that when we get back. We are really fighting the new world order.
[3:29:51.520 --> 3:30:00.520]  We're on the march. The Empire's on the run. Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[3:30:00.520 --> 3:30:06.520]  Hello, friends. This is Alex Jones and I want each of you to ask yourself this question. Do you really know what's in your tap water?
[3:30:06.520 --> 3:30:15.520]  In a recent study conducted by a major environmental auditor, they found that over 260 chemicals in pollutants are present in municipal drinking water.
[3:30:15.520 --> 3:30:22.520]  Many of these chemicals are directly linked to cancer, reproductive, immune and developmental system diseases. Now what are you going to do about it?
[3:30:22.520 --> 3:30:40.520]  The Acola Blue Atmospheric Water Generator is a low-cost way to take back control of you and your family's drinking water.

[3:33:20.520 --> 3:33:24.520]  Okay, ladies and gentlemen, we are back live continuing with your phone calls.
[3:33:24.520 --> 3:33:36.520]  Hollis and Indiana former SWAT team members since we woke him up in 2001, you're trying to make a point about the police really waking up now that you know because of the flu shot, the talk of quarantine, the talk of locking down cities.
[3:33:36.520 --> 3:33:39.080]  Now, we're not saying that's going to happen.
[3:33:39.080 --> 3:33:44.280]  The feds are saying under level six, under UN directorate, they may do it.
[3:33:44.280 --> 3:33:46.440]  And they're kind of doing a trial balloon right now.
[3:33:46.440 --> 3:33:48.600]  I don't think it's going to be successful.
[3:33:48.600 --> 3:33:53.560]  Just like they tried to model state's health emergency powers act in 2002, 2003, tried
[3:33:53.560 --> 3:33:59.480]  to force smallpox shots on 14 million first responders, doctors, nurses, firemen, police,
[3:33:59.480 --> 3:34:04.720]  city workers, county workers, federal workers, and the LA Times reported 99 plus percent
[3:34:04.720 --> 3:34:05.720]  said no.
[3:34:05.720 --> 3:34:10.520]  Only 4,000 said yes to the smallpox shot, and it caused some autoimmune response in
[3:34:10.520 --> 3:34:14.240]  people's heart valves and a bunch of people died of heart attacks.
[3:34:14.240 --> 3:34:15.240]  So they stopped it.
[3:34:15.240 --> 3:34:21.000]  Remember when Tommy Thompson, head of health and human services, wouldn't take the shot
[3:34:21.000 --> 3:34:22.900]  himself and the whole program fell apart?
[3:34:22.900 --> 3:34:25.320]  So they're going to try again and try the next time.
[3:34:25.320 --> 3:34:30.440]  And there are some fools, sucker born every minute, as PT Barnum said, lined up getting
[3:34:30.440 --> 3:34:33.040]  the old last year's flu shot.
[3:34:33.040 --> 3:34:38.200]  Give you no protection from this year's normal flu or the supposed dreaded swine flu, but
[3:34:38.200 --> 3:34:39.200]  they don't care.
[3:34:39.200 --> 3:34:43.920]  They're lined just like they admit Gardasil doesn't protect little girls from the human
[3:34:43.920 --> 3:34:44.920]  papillomavirus.
[3:34:44.920 --> 3:34:46.320]  It says it on the insert.
[3:34:46.320 --> 3:34:47.320]  They still take it.
[3:34:47.320 --> 3:34:50.520]  In fact, people search engine, go to start page dot com.
[3:34:50.520 --> 3:34:54.400]  That's good search engine or Google dot com and just type in Gardasil deaths.
[3:34:54.400 --> 3:34:56.920]  Let's do that for people right now on screen.
[3:34:56.920 --> 3:35:01.440]  And you can just read all about all the deaths, but people don't care.
[3:35:01.440 --> 3:35:04.720]  And it's so sad because they just buy into the nanny government wants to take care of
[3:35:04.720 --> 3:35:05.720]  them.
[3:35:05.720 --> 3:35:10.440]  No, the White House science czar says they want to use vaccines to sterilize you and
[3:35:10.440 --> 3:35:14.200]  put sterilants in the water to sterilize you and have a planetary government to carry
[3:35:14.200 --> 3:35:20.360]  out the orderly extermination of 80% of the world's population.
[3:35:20.360 --> 3:35:21.360]  Eco science.
[3:35:21.360 --> 3:35:23.920]  They read it for yourself.
[3:35:23.920 --> 3:35:25.520]  People say, Oh, well, he wrote this decades ago.
[3:35:25.520 --> 3:35:26.520]  Oh, really?
[3:35:26.520 --> 3:35:29.160]  We have him saying this stuff in 96.
[3:35:29.160 --> 3:35:31.960]  It's all coming up in the new film.
[3:35:31.960 --> 3:35:35.200]  Death toll linked to Gardasil vaccines rises.
[3:35:35.200 --> 3:35:40.720]  Companies include shock, phoning at the mouth, convulsions and coma.
[3:35:40.720 --> 3:35:41.720]  That's world net daily.
[3:35:41.720 --> 3:35:48.800]  But you can click to judicial watch has it was also CBS news right there for you.
[3:35:48.800 --> 3:35:52.800]  But see, when I was reading the trials three years ago and the large percentage of deaths
[3:35:52.800 --> 3:35:58.400]  and coma and odd is like a bowl of blood starts pouring out of every orifice, the corners
[3:35:58.400 --> 3:36:00.240]  of the eyes, the ears, the mouth.
[3:36:00.240 --> 3:36:05.080]  I mean, it's just we've shown video that we've had mothers on whose daughters are now in
[3:36:05.080 --> 3:36:06.080]  wheelchairs.
[3:36:06.080 --> 3:36:11.040]  I mean, and they give them one shot and they have a convulsion second shot a month later,
[3:36:11.040 --> 3:36:12.720]  bloody welts and they go, give them the third.
[3:36:12.720 --> 3:36:14.200]  We promise it's not the shot.
[3:36:14.200 --> 3:36:15.200]  Give them the shot.
[3:36:15.200 --> 3:36:16.200]  Dad.
[3:36:16.200 --> 3:36:21.240]  And they, they go, Hey, Gardasil's got a federal liability protection.
[3:36:21.240 --> 3:36:25.640]  Your daughter's dead and there's nothing they're going to do about it.
[3:36:25.640 --> 3:36:29.040]  It's all real funny when you're a eugenicist.
[3:36:29.040 --> 3:36:34.040]  And again, that's all covered in my film in game blueprint for global enslavement, nerve
[3:36:34.040 --> 3:36:40.400]  gassing our own troops, sterilizing children, sterilizing women, marching troops into chambers
[3:36:40.400 --> 3:36:43.640]  and nerve gassing them, radiating foster children to death.
[3:36:43.640 --> 3:36:48.040]  It's all in my film in game blueprint for global enslavement free on YouTube and Google.
[3:36:48.040 --> 3:36:51.240]  Or if you want the DVD, get it at info wars.com.
[3:36:51.240 --> 3:36:52.240]  That's how you support us.
[3:36:52.240 --> 3:36:57.320]  If you want to point out, you can pre-order camp FEMA, proving all the FEMA camps, all
[3:36:57.320 --> 3:37:02.400]  the programs, congressmen, FEMA camp survivors, civilian and labor camp program, where the
[3:37:02.400 --> 3:37:06.280]  camps are, how they're operating, how they're being set up, how they're going to roll them
[3:37:06.280 --> 3:37:12.360]  out as emergency relocation community centers, the mobile vans, the youth cores, that film
[3:37:12.360 --> 3:37:16.440]  I consulted on and then I'm in and pre-order it right now at info wars.com.
[3:37:16.440 --> 3:37:21.360]  And going back to Hollis, Hollis in Indiana, you were going to finish what you were saying
[3:37:21.360 --> 3:37:24.040]  about the flu shot before I went into a five minute rant.
[3:37:24.040 --> 3:37:25.040]  Yes.
[3:37:25.040 --> 3:37:30.800]  It was just that I advised several of the officers not to take that shot because I told
[3:37:30.800 --> 3:37:36.200]  them it will kill you or seriously injure you.
[3:37:36.200 --> 3:37:37.760]  And a lot of them weren't aware of it.
[3:37:37.760 --> 3:37:42.080]  They weren't aware of the squalene and the mercury and the thimerosal and everything
[3:37:42.080 --> 3:37:46.160]  else in those shots.
[3:37:46.160 --> 3:37:53.720]  And also, I was one of the ones that wouldn't allow my child to get the HPV shot, the cervical
[3:37:53.720 --> 3:37:54.720]  cancer shot.
[3:37:54.720 --> 3:37:59.880]  You know, I went through the medical exemption thing and I remember the nurse looking at
[3:37:59.880 --> 3:38:05.600]  me like I wasn't supposed to know that, you know, but it was through shows like yours
[3:38:05.600 --> 3:38:09.040]  that let me know that that's what's going on, you know.
[3:38:09.040 --> 3:38:12.680]  Well, that's when you know it's tyranny is when you see on the news every year when school
[3:38:12.680 --> 3:38:14.440]  starts, you must take all the shots.
[3:38:14.440 --> 3:38:18.680]  Now it's 60 something, just 20 something a decade ago, and it's the law and there's
[3:38:18.680 --> 3:38:19.680]  no exemption.
[3:38:19.680 --> 3:38:24.320]  And a lot of schools get, well, all of them get the bonus money if they get like 97% depends
[3:38:24.320 --> 3:38:26.280]  on the formula vaccinated.
[3:38:26.280 --> 3:38:29.600]  And so the nurses and people are told, you lose your job if you don't do this.
[3:38:29.600 --> 3:38:32.520]  So they'll lie and say, there is no exemption for you, you'll go, well, you have to give
[3:38:32.520 --> 3:38:33.520]  it to me.
[3:38:33.520 --> 3:38:34.520]  It's law.
[3:38:34.520 --> 3:38:35.520]  No, there isn't.
[3:38:35.520 --> 3:38:36.520]  There isn't one.
[3:38:36.520 --> 3:38:37.520]  Then you got to go to the health department and get it.
[3:38:37.520 --> 3:38:41.440]  But you know you're in tyranny when they've turned the nurse and the principal into Nazi
[3:38:41.440 --> 3:38:43.880]  thugs and they're lying going, you must take the shot.
[3:38:43.880 --> 3:38:44.880]  You know, there's no exemption.
[3:38:44.880 --> 3:38:49.400]  They've got it right there behind them and they're going, I get that bonus if I lie.
[3:38:49.400 --> 3:38:50.680]  I want to take that trip to Cancun.
[3:38:50.680 --> 3:38:51.880]  No, you got to take the shot.
[3:38:51.880 --> 3:38:54.520]  Then your daughter dies or has convulsions and is brain damaged.
[3:38:54.520 --> 3:38:55.520]  And they just laugh at you.
[3:38:55.520 --> 3:39:00.040]  And if you go get in their face at school, they pick the phone up and go, get a SWAT team
[3:39:00.040 --> 3:39:01.600]  in here immediately.
[3:39:01.600 --> 3:39:02.600]  Exactly.
[3:39:02.600 --> 3:39:03.600]  Yeah.
[3:39:03.600 --> 3:39:04.600]  Yeah.
[3:39:04.600 --> 3:39:10.520]  It's, it's, it's sometimes you have to, uh, you gotta laugh at it to keep from crying
[3:39:10.520 --> 3:39:14.080]  because it's, it's, it's, it's absolutely ridiculous.
[3:39:14.080 --> 3:39:19.440]  And I said a year ago to my wife that, uh, that when, when the, when the stuff hit the
[3:39:19.440 --> 3:39:23.520]  fan, there's going to be a mass run for the exits and we're not going to be able to leave.
[3:39:23.520 --> 3:39:28.520]  And sure enough, they're coming out with all these things like the, uh, or where you
[3:39:28.520 --> 3:39:31.280]  put us all kind of watch list and everything else.
[3:39:31.280 --> 3:39:36.080]  And, and, and like I said, I'm a police officer and I believe in, even though I'm a police
[3:39:36.080 --> 3:39:39.720]  officer, I believe in people's civil rights, you know, and
[3:39:39.720 --> 3:39:40.760]  well, that's your rights.
[3:39:40.760 --> 3:39:43.120]  That's your children's rights.
[3:39:43.120 --> 3:39:48.120]  My, my children, my grandchildren, they're going to be the next generation that's going
[3:39:48.120 --> 3:39:53.800]  to be coming up and I don't want them to be living in a, in a blade runner kind of world.
[3:39:53.800 --> 3:39:55.600]  It's going to be worse than that.
[3:39:55.600 --> 3:39:56.600]  God bless you, sir.
[3:39:56.600 --> 3:39:57.600]  Yeah.
[3:39:57.600 --> 3:39:58.600]  Yeah.
[3:39:58.600 --> 3:39:59.600]  It's going to be worse.
[3:39:59.600 --> 3:40:04.520]  It's like, like I said, I, and I have a, I see things that a lot of people don't see
[3:40:04.520 --> 3:40:07.120]  and sometimes it's so maddening to me.
[3:40:07.120 --> 3:40:12.480]  I have to sometimes step back away from it and, uh, just to, uh, uh, cool off from it.
[3:40:12.480 --> 3:40:18.400]  You know, it's a, and I, I, I, I have a, uh, uh, uh, officer, a friend, uh, also he's
[3:40:18.400 --> 3:40:22.240]  a pastor and he actually said, he actually had to step away from the church.
[3:40:22.240 --> 3:40:25.600]  He said, either I was crazy or I knew what I was talking about.
[3:40:25.600 --> 3:40:29.000]  So I told him, I said, look, just, just go investigate it yourself.
[3:40:29.000 --> 3:40:30.480]  Don't take my word for it.
[3:40:30.480 --> 3:40:33.600]  Check into it yourself.
[3:40:33.600 --> 3:40:34.600]  And what happened to him?
[3:40:34.600 --> 3:40:38.200]  He, he stepped away from the church and he said, he found out what I was saying was all
[3:40:38.200 --> 3:40:39.200]  true.
[3:40:39.200 --> 3:40:44.800]  And, uh, he stepped back and he went back to his church and he started telling everybody
[3:40:44.800 --> 3:40:48.400]  in his church, what's going on, you know, God bless you, sir.
[3:40:48.400 --> 3:40:49.400]  Good to hear from you.
[3:40:49.400 --> 3:40:50.400]  Keep calling.
[3:40:50.400 --> 3:40:51.400]  Yeah.
[3:40:51.400 --> 3:40:52.400]  I mean, that's the thing that's happening here.
[3:40:52.400 --> 3:40:57.320]  Remember three years ago when we broke on this network, Pastor Butch Paul, actually
[3:40:57.320 --> 3:41:01.280]  the one that broke it, then I separately had another pastor send me the info and I had
[3:41:01.280 --> 3:41:06.760]  them both on and that's when it got big hundreds of pages of secret FEMA documents about how
[3:41:06.760 --> 3:41:12.400]  they'd already covertly trained 13,000 pastors of major churches to tell their flocks, go
[3:41:12.400 --> 3:41:19.040]  to FEMA camps, take shots, uh, turn in your guns, uh, go along with socialism or, or you're
[3:41:19.040 --> 3:41:21.240]  not Christian.
[3:41:21.240 --> 3:41:24.920]  And we broke this and people thought the documents were fake.
[3:41:24.920 --> 3:41:29.000]  And then the feds went and check phone records and tracked and we were already under surveillance
[3:41:29.000 --> 3:41:34.960]  and tracked back the preacher and went and threatened him and then a year and a half
[3:41:34.960 --> 3:41:40.120]  later it came out on the news that clergy response teams, just Google the term clergy
[3:41:40.120 --> 3:41:45.800]  response teams and you can watch saying, Oh yes, the preachers, Romans 13 do what government
[3:41:45.800 --> 3:41:50.320]  says it's of God's submit, which is what Hitler's favorite quote, Romans 13.
[3:41:50.320 --> 3:41:51.320]  He used that on the Germans.
[3:41:51.320 --> 3:41:52.320]  That was the main reason they did it.
[3:41:52.320 --> 3:41:54.680]  And he said, it's of Jesus to do what I say.
[3:41:54.680 --> 3:42:00.120]  And they went and literally went off the edge of the cliff with him.
[3:42:00.120 --> 3:42:03.000]  And so that happened.
[3:42:03.000 --> 3:42:06.640]  And then, and then now the last documents we got were in 2008.
[3:42:06.640 --> 3:42:12.160]  They hadn't doubled the clergy response to 30 to 26,000 in regard.
[3:42:12.160 --> 3:42:18.480]  The last numbers we got were 2008 was 55,000 executives are now armed national security
[3:42:18.480 --> 3:42:26.080]  spies with 007 licensed to kill their employees during martial law.
[3:42:26.080 --> 3:42:27.600]  And that's mainstream news.
[3:42:27.600 --> 3:42:35.040]  I mean, they're, they just got spies all over the place and, and now we suddenly see preachers
[3:42:35.040 --> 3:42:38.400]  on TV going, take the shot, turn in your guns.
[3:42:38.400 --> 3:42:39.880]  It's of the Lord.
[3:42:39.880 --> 3:42:41.480]  Don't criticize government.
[3:42:41.480 --> 3:42:44.680]  Jesus says support what the government says.
[3:42:44.680 --> 3:42:49.880]  And it just goes on and on and on and on and on and on.
[3:42:49.880 --> 3:42:55.640]  I mean, this country is being taken over by scientific corporate offshore banks.
[3:42:55.640 --> 3:43:00.960]  And they mean business briefly because I want to get into these documents.
[3:43:00.960 --> 3:43:06.080]  But Mark, I don't want you to say your full name or where you're calling from, but you're
[3:43:06.080 --> 3:43:12.480]  saying that you as a current police officer as a lieutenant that you're forced to show
[3:43:12.480 --> 3:43:16.840]  your roll call or the police officers at the start of the shift, the video that you just
[3:43:16.840 --> 3:43:18.840]  heard us air.
[3:43:18.840 --> 3:43:27.200]  Yes, they provide a DVD and we were to show it to each of the roll calls, which we did.
[3:43:27.200 --> 3:43:31.200]  And there's a sign up sheet that each officer has to sign that says that he watched the
[3:43:31.200 --> 3:43:34.000]  video.
[3:43:34.000 --> 3:43:35.600]  Did the officers buy it?
[3:43:35.600 --> 3:43:40.400]  I mean, do they now think that every young lady is a murdering terrorist?
[3:43:40.400 --> 3:43:45.840]  You know, there wasn't a whole lot of discussion over it.
[3:43:45.840 --> 3:43:50.120]  I think they just just watched it and they went on there.
[3:43:50.120 --> 3:43:56.640]  There wasn't a discussion with me and they may have discussed it themselves, but I don't
[3:43:56.640 --> 3:43:57.640]  I don't know.
[3:43:57.640 --> 3:44:01.040]  But I mean, do they believe that they're just terrorist under every table?
[3:44:01.040 --> 3:44:03.640]  No, I don't think so.
[3:44:03.640 --> 3:44:04.640]  No.
[3:44:04.640 --> 3:44:06.560]  I mean, you heard my analysis of it.
[3:44:06.560 --> 3:44:12.120]  But then if you sent us an email during the transmission of this video and audio, I mean,
[3:44:12.120 --> 3:44:15.160]  did you see the same manipulation in the video I saw?
[3:44:15.160 --> 3:44:17.160]  Yes, I did.
[3:44:17.160 --> 3:44:20.600]  But that's because I'm I'm woken up to the whole thing.
[3:44:20.600 --> 3:44:24.480]  And there's a lot of a lot of deputies that have not as many as I'd like.
[3:44:24.480 --> 3:44:25.480]  But yeah, I saw.
[3:44:25.480 --> 3:44:30.720]  But as a matter of fact, I wanted to run my own name through there because of my internet
[3:44:30.720 --> 3:44:31.720]  activity and stuff.
[3:44:31.720 --> 3:44:36.800]  I figured they even had me on there, be honest with you, you know, you're right.
[3:44:36.800 --> 3:44:39.680]  And if we give into this chilling effect, it's over.
[3:44:39.680 --> 3:44:41.040]  People ask me why I'm not worried about it.
[3:44:41.040 --> 3:44:45.120]  Look, my children have no future and I love people's other people's kids as much as I
[3:44:45.120 --> 3:44:46.120]  love mine.
[3:44:46.120 --> 3:44:47.120]  I love their innocence.
[3:44:47.120 --> 3:44:48.120]  I love the sparkle in their eyes.
[3:44:48.120 --> 3:44:49.320]  I love how good they are.
[3:44:49.320 --> 3:44:54.440]  And over my dead body, am I going to let a bunch of offshore banks study all the scientific
[3:44:54.440 --> 3:44:58.480]  tyrannies of the last hundred years and then perfect it?
[3:44:58.480 --> 3:45:01.080]  They call it the final revolution.
[3:45:01.080 --> 3:45:03.360]  They call it the ultimate tyranny.
[3:45:03.360 --> 3:45:04.960]  And they think it's cute and funny.
[3:45:04.960 --> 3:45:07.200]  It's not cute and funny to me.
[3:45:07.200 --> 3:45:11.320]  And I know that they've played police and the people off against each other at a primitive
[3:45:11.320 --> 3:45:12.320]  level.
[3:45:12.320 --> 3:45:13.320]  I've bought into that.
[3:45:13.320 --> 3:45:16.240]  But you notice, if you've been listening, I've kind of woken up to that that really
[3:45:16.240 --> 3:45:19.560]  the police, I'm beginning to realize are greatest ally because they're really getting
[3:45:19.560 --> 3:45:23.120]  it because they're on the inside of this and know I'm telling the truth.
[3:45:23.120 --> 3:45:28.760]  If the police will just look at what I'm saying, they're going to have my same level of desperation
[3:45:28.760 --> 3:45:33.120]  to warn people because this is real tyranny.
[3:45:33.120 --> 3:45:34.400]  This isn't boss hog corruption.
[3:45:34.400 --> 3:45:38.520]  If this was just boss hog corruption, I would fight it, but I'd work eight hours a day and
[3:45:38.520 --> 3:45:39.640]  it wouldn't be that big of a deal.
[3:45:39.640 --> 3:45:40.960]  This isn't boss hog corruption.
[3:45:40.960 --> 3:45:42.800]  This is what Hitler came out of.
[3:45:42.800 --> 3:45:47.640]  But worse, Hitler thanked American eugenicists in Mein Kampf.
[3:45:47.640 --> 3:45:49.640]  He thanked them in his speeches.
[3:45:49.640 --> 3:45:55.120]  He thanked the people that the White House science are quotes as his idols.
[3:45:55.120 --> 3:46:00.160]  So we're in a crisis and everybody's under effect of this.
[3:46:00.160 --> 3:46:01.840]  They are chemtrailing us.
[3:46:01.840 --> 3:46:03.040]  They are poisoning the water.
[3:46:03.040 --> 3:46:04.840]  It is on record.
[3:46:04.840 --> 3:46:06.640]  And this is the big kahuna.
[3:46:06.640 --> 3:46:08.400]  Do people have the will to face the truth?
[3:46:08.400 --> 3:46:09.400]  I don't know.
[3:46:09.400 --> 3:46:11.400]  All I know is it's real.
[3:46:11.400 --> 3:46:13.760]  As for me, I'm standing up to it.
[3:46:13.760 --> 3:46:16.000]  Anything else you'd like to add, sir?
[3:46:16.000 --> 3:46:20.120]  Law enforcement is just like the everyday guy.
[3:46:20.120 --> 3:46:21.760]  They realize something's wrong.
[3:46:21.760 --> 3:46:23.480]  A lot of them can't put their finger on it.
[3:46:23.480 --> 3:46:28.160]  They don't know, but as more and more comes to light, I think they're seeing it.
[3:46:28.160 --> 3:46:29.560]  I agree with you.
[3:46:29.560 --> 3:46:33.560]  They're in law enforcement closer to it than anybody else.
[3:46:33.560 --> 3:46:35.560]  And so they're going to see it, I think, a little bit quicker.
[3:46:35.560 --> 3:46:40.040]  But I do have a question for you that I've been bugging me and I've actually wanted to
[3:46:40.040 --> 3:46:42.480]  bounce off of you if you've got a minute.
[3:46:42.480 --> 3:46:43.480]  Sure.
[3:46:43.480 --> 3:46:44.480]  Go ahead.
[3:46:44.480 --> 3:46:52.360]  At our agency, our sheriff has hired two federal law enforcement officers who he has given
[3:46:52.360 --> 3:46:59.960]  positions at the office above me, majors and colonels.
[3:46:59.960 --> 3:47:05.440]  And I was just wondering if that was a trend among other agencies, that the local sheriffs
[3:47:05.440 --> 3:47:12.160]  are hiring federal law enforcement officers for high positions in local, you know, law
[3:47:12.160 --> 3:47:13.160]  enforcement.
[3:47:13.160 --> 3:47:17.880]  That's a Pentagon national security classified directive.
[3:47:17.880 --> 3:47:20.920]  And they've been doing it for at least 15 years.
[3:47:20.920 --> 3:47:25.760]  They had a, the first they did it to secure drug corridors for heroin and cocaine coming
[3:47:25.760 --> 3:47:30.120]  into the United States without other cops, other lower level officers busting them.
[3:47:30.120 --> 3:47:34.840]  The problem is the local police kept busting CIA routes, you know, tractor trailers full
[3:47:34.840 --> 3:47:35.840]  of cocaine.
[3:47:35.840 --> 3:47:39.800]  The FBI would come into Texas in one case and, you know, take the three tons and disappear
[3:47:39.800 --> 3:47:40.800]  with it.
[3:47:40.800 --> 3:47:43.600]  So the excuse was they started with corrupt police.
[3:47:43.600 --> 3:47:49.960]  Then they came in and you can look all this up, then they came in and federalized with
[3:47:49.960 --> 3:47:53.440]  federal grants and Homeland security money.
[3:47:53.440 --> 3:48:00.560]  And they, they would also use local political slush funds to run former FBI, former DEA,
[3:48:00.560 --> 3:48:09.160]  former special forces, former defense intelligence, former army security agency, former Navy security
[3:48:09.160 --> 3:48:11.440]  agency, former naval intelligence.
[3:48:11.440 --> 3:48:16.920]  And if you'll look more than half of your sheriffs and people and even mayors now are
[3:48:16.920 --> 3:48:20.600]  spooks, they're operatives.
[3:48:20.600 --> 3:48:21.600]  This has come out.
[3:48:21.600 --> 3:48:25.560]  I mean, it goes way back to the sixties and LA is completely CIA run and the Vikings and
[3:48:25.560 --> 3:48:30.040]  all those sub police groups that are really a mafia.
[3:48:30.040 --> 3:48:33.880]  So, so all of that is going on.
[3:48:33.880 --> 3:48:39.100]  And so now Google this, local police departments everywhere getting money to put regular army
[3:48:39.100 --> 3:48:43.920]  and Marine Corps liaisons in their intelligence unit.
[3:48:43.920 --> 3:48:47.200]  And so not just, first it started in places near bases.
[3:48:47.200 --> 3:48:48.920]  Now it's everywhere.
[3:48:48.920 --> 3:48:54.800]  And so they're fully unionizing is the term or federalizing you.
[3:48:54.800 --> 3:49:00.160]  And through the threat integration fusion centers as the cover name, oh, we got a free
[3:49:00.160 --> 3:49:01.160]  national guard armoring.
[3:49:01.160 --> 3:49:03.200]  This is going to be the new threat fusion center.
[3:49:03.200 --> 3:49:07.600]  You get a nice big office, Lieutenant, and you're going to have Colonel Johnson over
[3:49:07.600 --> 3:49:08.600]  you.
[3:49:08.600 --> 3:49:11.120]  By the way, we're going to be doing a gun confiscation drill this week.
[3:49:11.120 --> 3:49:16.960]  Oh, the Marines want to drop by and do a DWI checkpoint.
[3:49:16.960 --> 3:49:17.960]  They want to help you.
[3:49:17.960 --> 3:49:21.360]  And then if you say no, you get demoted or frozen.
[3:49:21.360 --> 3:49:25.840]  If you say yes, you go to the top and then, oh, North Carolina is going to work with
[3:49:25.840 --> 3:49:34.920]  black water or, oh, San Diego, Orange County is going to have a black water or XZ worldwide
[3:49:34.920 --> 3:49:36.760]  is going to be helping do marijuana raids.
[3:49:36.760 --> 3:49:38.880]  You know, that's confirmed LA times.
[3:49:38.880 --> 3:49:40.280]  So do you see what's happening?
[3:49:40.280 --> 3:49:41.280]  Oh, absolutely.
[3:49:41.280 --> 3:49:42.280]  Yeah.
[3:49:42.280 --> 3:49:48.160]  Well, our sheriff, I went to high school with, so I know he doesn't have that background,
[3:49:48.160 --> 3:49:53.000]  but maybe they've got him, made him, he's very politically oriented, just like every
[3:49:53.000 --> 3:49:54.000]  sheriff.
[3:49:54.000 --> 3:49:58.960]  So I guess they've probably gotten to him, you know, well, yeah, a lot of these are good
[3:49:58.960 --> 3:50:04.720]  old boys that are like, listen, we can give you some federal help here and you will help
[3:50:04.720 --> 3:50:10.040]  help you run for state office if you do good sheriff.
[3:50:10.040 --> 3:50:14.480]  But a lot of these guys are just boss hog types and they just whore themselves out and
[3:50:14.480 --> 3:50:19.040]  it's just easy and they go to lunch and drive around and play golf and they look the other
[3:50:19.040 --> 3:50:23.320]  way on the drug shipments and, you know, get a couple hundred grand in cash a year and
[3:50:23.320 --> 3:50:28.080]  they visit the hookers and you know, it's just life's good.
[3:50:28.080 --> 3:50:31.360]  You know, meanwhile, that's how this pure evil is working.
[3:50:31.360 --> 3:50:33.360]  But good to hear from you, sir.
[3:50:33.360 --> 3:50:34.720]  Thank you for the update.
[3:50:34.720 --> 3:50:35.720]  Anything else comes in?
[3:50:35.720 --> 3:50:36.720]  Let us know.
[3:50:36.720 --> 3:50:37.720]  God bless you for defending the Republic.
[3:50:37.720 --> 3:50:38.720]  Thank you.
[3:50:38.720 --> 3:50:39.720]  You bet.
[3:50:39.720 --> 3:50:43.720]  You know, I'm tempted to do 10 minutes of overdrive today because I promise to get to
[3:50:43.720 --> 3:50:48.680]  all these documents and we're, you know what, 10 minutes of overdrive, we're going to do
[3:50:48.680 --> 3:50:52.320]  10 minutes overdrive in my interview with the TV network, but I'm going to do 10 minutes
[3:50:52.320 --> 3:50:53.320]  overdrive.
[3:50:53.320 --> 3:50:54.320]  It'll be internet only.
[3:50:54.320 --> 3:50:59.400]  The final segment on AM and FM is coming up after this quick segment info wars.com.
[3:50:59.400 --> 3:51:00.400]  Stay with us.
[3:51:00.400 --> 3:51:03.880]  This is Alex Jones with important news.
[3:51:03.880 --> 3:51:07.800]  I want to warn you about a deadly storm that's fast approaching a storm that will affect
[3:51:07.800 --> 3:51:09.200]  you and everybody you know.
[3:51:09.200 --> 3:51:10.200]  Here's the story.
[3:51:10.200 --> 3:51:13.680]  The current administration is committed to nationalizing healthcare, giving 40 million
[3:51:13.680 --> 3:51:14.920]  new people free care.
[3:51:14.920 --> 3:51:16.160]  Now here's the bad news.
[3:51:16.160 --> 3:51:19.800]  The current system will almost be immediately overwhelmed by these new demands for free
[3:51:19.800 --> 3:51:21.560]  services and procedures.
[3:51:21.560 --> 3:51:23.440]  Medicare and Medicaid are already bankrupt.
[3:51:23.440 --> 3:51:27.960]  Many doctors are now leaving their practices frightened by the prospect of forced procedures.
[3:51:27.960 --> 3:51:32.120]  All this is creating a perfect storm, which could create unimaginable shortages in the
[3:51:32.120 --> 3:51:33.120]  healthcare services.
[3:51:33.120 --> 3:51:35.680]  Folks, it's time to be prepared for the worst.
[3:51:35.680 --> 3:51:39.480]  Our friends at Solutions from Science have recently come up with an emergency preparedness
[3:51:39.480 --> 3:51:44.360]  course that reveals how you can make powerful herbal medicines in the privacy of your own
[3:51:44.360 --> 3:51:45.360]  home.
[3:51:45.360 --> 3:51:48.960]  It's called Herbal Preparations and Natural Therapies and is flat out the best course
[3:51:48.960 --> 3:51:49.960]  of its kind.
[3:51:49.960 --> 3:51:54.080]  I recommend you visit this important new website at makeherbalmedicines.com.
[3:51:54.080 --> 3:52:02.000]  That's makeherbalmedicines.com or call toll free 877-327-0365.
[3:52:02.000 --> 3:52:07.280]  In the new world order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[3:52:07.280 --> 3:52:13.440]  We've got to have a civilian national security force that's just as powerful, just as strong,
[3:52:13.440 --> 3:52:15.400]  just as well funded.
[3:52:15.400 --> 3:52:20.560]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest
[3:52:20.560 --> 3:52:21.560]  of the American people.
[3:52:21.560 --> 3:52:26.440]  While Obama's already fudging, he's fudged since day one in this election.
[3:52:26.440 --> 3:52:31.560]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing
[3:52:31.560 --> 3:52:38.040]  the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascism.
[3:52:38.040 --> 3:52:41.600]  It's not about left or right, it's about a one world government.
[3:52:41.600 --> 3:52:48.520]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.
[3:52:48.520 --> 3:52:54.120]  Get your copy of the Obama deception today at infowars.com or download it in super high

[3:53:08.080 --> 3:53:10.960]  But with the help of Dan Pilla, you can get your problem solved.

[3:53:30.280 --> 3:53:33.360]  on what the IRS will consider to be taxable income.

[3:54:11.400 --> 3:54:20.160]  I'm going to do 10, 15 minutes of overdrive and our guest in the studio here, the lovely
[3:54:20.160 --> 3:54:31.600]  Carol with HDTV, Mark Cuban's network TV channel on cable, satellite, they're doing
[3:54:31.600 --> 3:54:38.000]  a 25 minute, 30 minute show, 25 minutes of programming on his network coming up in late
[3:54:38.000 --> 3:54:43.680]  September and she wants to hear from militias, real militias and I know there are a lot of
[3:54:43.680 --> 3:54:49.120]  real militias, call yourselves military study groups out there, if you want to call in with
[3:54:49.120 --> 3:54:53.000]  a quick comment, quick statement to her about why you're doing what you're doing, what you
[3:54:53.000 --> 3:55:02.760]  stand for, I'm going to give you this number to call, it's 888-201-2244, only militia people
[3:55:02.760 --> 3:55:13.280]  call, 888-201-2244, 888-201-2244, the official show ends in 5 minutes, we are then going
[3:55:13.280 --> 3:55:17.480]  to come back after a 1 minute break when the official show ends and do 15 minutes of phone
[3:55:17.480 --> 3:55:20.600]  calls.
[3:55:20.600 --> 3:55:25.680]  I did a bunch of research today, had my guys print up a bunch of research to go over this
[3:55:25.680 --> 3:55:32.520]  for you, so I do want to cover this in the interview we do afterwards because so many
[3:55:32.520 --> 3:55:40.960]  facets to this, there is the militia, I mean until the turn of the last century or 105
[3:55:40.960 --> 3:55:46.800]  years ago roughly, because it started in 1903, 1906, we officially got the National Guard,
[3:55:46.800 --> 3:55:51.160]  it was known the militia was armed men and that the sheriff or the governor would call
[3:55:51.160 --> 3:55:56.520]  them out, county level sheriff, city level the mayor or his police chief, it was civil
[3:55:56.520 --> 3:56:00.560]  defense, so when they say oh there's no militia in the second amendment or the militia means
[3:56:00.560 --> 3:56:04.920]  the military, no clearly the founding fathers, the federalist papers, that's clear, so you
[3:56:04.920 --> 3:56:10.200]  have the media demonizing and trying to say it doesn't exist, trying to say there's no
[3:56:10.200 --> 3:56:16.120]  right for people to keep and bear arms that the citizen militia itself is a fraud, isn't
[3:56:16.120 --> 3:56:21.720]  legitimate, that's a lie, clearly historically, but then you have the other attack starting
[3:56:21.720 --> 3:56:26.240]  in the early 90s when there was a huge anti-UN, anti-world government, anti-big government
[3:56:26.240 --> 3:56:32.720]  movement where the fed systematically from Indiana to Florida to Michigan to Texas would
[3:56:32.720 --> 3:56:39.640]  go in and radicalize groups and would try to link them to white supremacists, so what
[3:56:39.640 --> 3:56:43.360]  you do is you have white supremacists that are bad and the media always and the government
[3:56:43.360 --> 3:56:48.160]  tries to link them then to militias to demonize that and then they demonize second amendment
[3:56:48.160 --> 3:56:52.560]  groups by linking them to militias, so see gun groups are linked to militias, they're
[3:56:52.560 --> 3:56:58.320]  linked to white supremacists and that's how they then demonize the militia movement and
[3:56:58.320 --> 3:57:03.800]  they try to say it's right wing when really it's past parties, it understands we have
[3:57:03.800 --> 3:57:09.920]  a corporate dictatorship and there were militia hearings in the early 1990s and mid-90s where
[3:57:09.920 --> 3:57:14.440]  there were black commanders in there saying, I'm tired of the oppressive force of government
[3:57:14.440 --> 3:57:19.960]  being built up against me and the balance of power being so out of whack with Waco and
[3:57:19.960 --> 3:57:23.960]  what the army did there and the training at Fort Hood and what happened at Ruby Ridge,
[3:57:23.960 --> 3:57:27.640]  hundreds of troops for this man, they shoot his woman in the head with the baby in her
[3:57:27.640 --> 3:57:33.160]  arms, they shoot the 14-year-old in the back, Sam Weaver, so that was a response to people
[3:57:33.160 --> 3:57:38.240]  just like a dog if you corner it, it'll start growling to seeing mainly military veterans
[3:57:38.240 --> 3:57:42.320]  who'd been in third world countries, been in communist countries, they recognized tyranny
[3:57:42.320 --> 3:57:46.280]  and said, this is tyranny, I'm going to buy guns, I'm going to start training to defend
[3:57:46.280 --> 3:57:52.240]  myself, that's in the Bill of Rights and Constitution and so then you got some cooks
[3:57:52.240 --> 3:57:56.480]  and weirdos that the media would pay attention to that were legitimately strange and guys
[3:57:56.480 --> 3:58:01.200]  that wanted to wear uniforms or had a bass boat and wanted to say they were admirals,
[3:58:01.200 --> 3:58:03.880]  but that's a minority.
[3:58:03.880 --> 3:58:08.960]  Mainly you had feds coming in trying to create militias, radicalize them to set people up
[3:58:08.960 --> 3:58:14.560]  to demonize the movement overall and so that's the key and I have the proof here in this
[3:58:14.560 --> 3:58:17.960]  stack that we're going to cover for five minutes in overdrive, then we're going to the phone
[3:58:17.960 --> 3:58:22.480]  calls straight ahead for militia people or militia supporters or people that were in
[3:58:22.480 --> 3:58:26.680]  it in the 90s and got out of it or just gun owners, people buying guns, why are you buying
[3:58:26.680 --> 3:58:33.040]  guns, why did you feel like you need to go out and buy guns and then get training, 888-201-2244,
[3:58:33.040 --> 3:58:39.080]  888-201-2244, will only be at infowars.com on the audio streams and prisonplanet.tv,
[3:58:39.080 --> 3:58:41.200]  internet only in T-minus 70 seconds.
[3:58:41.200 --> 3:58:51.480]  Thank you for listening to GCN, be sure to visit GCNLive.com today.
[3:58:51.480 --> 3:58:55.920]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator
[3:58:55.920 --> 3:58:56.920]  this summer.
[3:58:56.920 --> 3:59:00.800]  Number one, new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[3:59:00.800 --> 3:59:05.360]  Number two, our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company
[3:59:05.360 --> 3:59:06.360]  allows you to have.
[3:59:06.360 --> 3:59:11.000]  It's true, total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology has
[3:59:11.000 --> 3:59:12.000]  coming.
[3:59:12.000 --> 3:59:15.800]  Number three, in some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously overloaded,
[3:59:15.800 --> 3:59:18.280]  especially with the high demand summer months ahead.
[3:59:18.280 --> 3:59:21.840]  Number four, the hurricane and dangerous summer storm season is here again.
[3:59:21.840 --> 3:59:25.520]  Every year thousands of families lose their power from weather related outages.
[3:59:25.520 --> 3:59:30.080]  Number five, a solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind.
[3:59:30.080 --> 3:59:34.200]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science,
[3:59:34.200 --> 3:59:35.880]  a long time sponsor of ours.
[3:59:35.880 --> 3:59:43.440]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com, that's mysolarbackup.com, remember the government
[3:59:43.440 --> 3:59:51.560]  doesn't own the sun yet, so go to mysolarbackup.com or call toll free 877-327-0365.
[3:59:51.560 --> 4:00:17.120]  Direct to you and in your face, you're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network.
[4:00:21.560 --> 4:00:32.720]  Well, it is Tuesday, the first day of September 2009, eight year anniversary of the false
[4:00:32.720 --> 4:00:41.040]  flag terror attacks operation Northwood's part two that we know is the September 11 tragedy
[4:00:41.040 --> 4:00:49.920]  and I have Mark Cuban's HD network here and Mark really is a maverick, pun intended and
[4:00:49.920 --> 4:00:54.440]  every sense of the word, he puts out a loss if I disagree with, some stuff I agree with,
[4:00:54.440 --> 4:01:00.280]  but I remember hearing behind the scenes from Charlie Sheen and other people that Mark was
[4:01:00.280 --> 4:01:05.200]  getting threats and things when we were going to put out loose change final cut with Charlie
[4:01:05.200 --> 4:01:13.320]  Sheen in it and I never got the tails, you know, I was there when there were some conversations
[4:01:13.320 --> 4:01:18.920]  on the phone with him, but I went on the line and sitting around the table there and overlooking
[4:01:18.920 --> 4:01:22.960]  California and area that's now on fire years ago and then later it came out in the New
[4:01:22.960 --> 4:01:28.400]  York Times that the Securities and Exchange Commission called Mark Cuban and emailed
[4:01:28.400 --> 4:01:32.800]  him and said, we don't like you in that 9-11 film, you bastard, we're going to send you
[4:01:32.800 --> 4:01:34.800]  to prison, you watch.
[4:01:34.800 --> 4:01:36.320]  Mark's like, my God.
[4:01:36.320 --> 4:01:39.160]  And suddenly he was saying he was going to put the film out, suddenly he said, you know
[4:01:39.160 --> 4:01:42.920]  what, I'm not going to do this now, I don't blame him, you know, he's like this is getting
[4:01:42.920 --> 4:01:46.920]  crazy and Bill O'Reilly was like, you'll be found in the East River, Charlie Sheen and
[4:01:46.920 --> 4:01:47.920]  Mark Cuban.
[4:01:47.920 --> 4:01:53.920]  And he was like mafia threats, don't do this, I'm telling you, it's over, it's full years.
[4:01:53.920 --> 4:01:54.920]  And what a bully.
[4:01:54.920 --> 4:02:00.560]  I mean, this was like crazy how scared the establishment was of one movie.
[4:02:00.560 --> 4:02:01.560]  They were idiots.
[4:02:01.560 --> 4:02:05.440]  All it made was the film go more viral on the Internet, conservatively that film that's
[4:02:05.440 --> 4:02:10.640]  three variants has probably had a hundred million views, just that film alone.
[4:02:10.640 --> 4:02:16.480]  But the point is, you know, one view alone on Google three years ago when it had been
[4:02:16.480 --> 4:02:20.600]  out for a year, Matty Fair called Google and said, what's that one video got?
[4:02:20.600 --> 4:02:24.520]  And they said, 10 million plus, and there's just hundreds of versions of it's just, there's
[4:02:24.520 --> 4:02:28.600]  no way to even calculate it, but they're just morons.
[4:02:28.600 --> 4:02:32.440]  I mean, some theatrical release, even it was big would have reached one hundredth of that,
[4:02:32.440 --> 4:02:38.480]  you know, but again, that's why these dinosaurs only think and that's why it's so good.
[4:02:38.480 --> 4:02:42.040]  There's these Cold War dinosaurs that are like 85 still running things.
[4:02:42.040 --> 4:02:45.800]  We're in trouble when the younger ones get in that starting to already happen and the
[4:02:45.800 --> 4:02:48.560]  younger ones are telling them, you just got to shut the web off, no matter you got a stage
[4:02:48.560 --> 4:02:52.600]  of false terror attack on it, say it's dead and Obama's like, yeah, put in the cybersecurity
[4:02:52.600 --> 4:02:54.760]  command to kill the web to save it.
[4:02:54.760 --> 4:02:56.480]  So they're moving right now on that front.
[4:02:56.480 --> 4:02:57.640]  It's already too late.
[4:02:57.640 --> 4:02:58.640]  Even that attempt's going to fail.
[4:02:58.640 --> 4:03:03.040]  Again, you can kill me, but ideas are bulletproof.
[4:03:03.040 --> 4:03:06.800]  As was said in V for Vendetta, ideas are eternal.
[4:03:06.800 --> 4:03:08.720]  And so there's no stopping this now.
[4:03:08.720 --> 4:03:12.400]  You might as well come in for the big win for the Republic, bring the bankers of justice,
[4:03:12.400 --> 4:03:16.080]  press the federal reserve board for their crimes, have them indicted as Ron Paul has
[4:03:16.080 --> 4:03:17.400]  called for on this show.
[4:03:17.400 --> 4:03:21.280]  Clearly all the crimes they've committed, the insider trading, the rigging, all of it.
[4:03:21.280 --> 4:03:26.960]  I'm going to go to your calls, Charles, Mike, Rick, Casey and Jim, militia members and get
[4:03:26.960 --> 4:03:31.320]  their quick comments here in a moment, but I wanted to just go over this evidence.
[4:03:31.320 --> 4:03:35.360]  We have a new story out on prismplanet.com, provocateurs that end the Fed rally, court
[4:03:35.360 --> 4:03:39.280]  of testimony given at a Missouri House representatives meeting yesterday, anarchists attempted to
[4:03:39.280 --> 4:03:44.280]  get other protesters to commit criminal acts during the end the Fed protests last year
[4:03:44.280 --> 4:03:49.280]  in what was possible attempt in instigate chaos to justify a harsh crackdown on behalf
[4:03:49.280 --> 4:03:50.280]  of the authorities.
[4:03:50.280 --> 4:03:53.080]  And then it goes into all the history of this happening.
[4:03:53.080 --> 4:03:56.240]  In March it came to light that the end the Fed protests, which took place at banks and
[4:03:56.240 --> 4:04:00.160]  regional federal reserve branches across the country on November 22nd, it's happened
[4:04:00.160 --> 4:04:04.160]  since then, were being monitored closely by the United States Army Reserve Command.
[4:04:04.160 --> 4:04:09.000]  We have a link to the secret document we broke right there who implied that those protesting
[4:04:09.000 --> 4:04:12.640]  against the Fed and the banks for bailout were terrorist.
[4:04:12.640 --> 4:04:17.760]  On November 22nd, 2008, Alex Jones led a rally at the Federal Reserve Bank in Dallas, Texas.
[4:04:17.760 --> 4:04:21.340]  The Dallas protestors specifically mentioned the official army document Ron Paul's brother
[4:04:21.340 --> 4:04:25.960]  was also in attendance during testimony given in response to the infamous Missouri information
[4:04:25.960 --> 4:04:26.960]  analysis.
[4:04:26.960 --> 4:04:30.480]  My report, a document authored by Missouri Highway Patrol and distributed was really
[4:04:30.480 --> 4:04:31.480]  written by the feds.
[4:04:31.480 --> 4:04:34.640]  It was just a federal version to follow law enforcement agencies that characterizes Ron
[4:04:34.640 --> 4:04:38.120]  Paul supporters, libertarians, people who display political bumper stickers, people
[4:04:38.120 --> 4:04:42.640]  who own gold, or even people who fly the U.S. flag as potential domestic terrorists.
[4:04:42.640 --> 4:04:46.800]  One of the organizers who attended the protest said that anarchists attempted to recruit
[4:04:46.800 --> 4:04:49.120]  followers and encourage them to commit illegal acts.
[4:04:49.120 --> 4:04:52.680]  Yeah, and then you look at the video in the photos, I've seen this in Austin.
[4:04:52.680 --> 4:04:56.560]  The Fortune 599, or was it 2000, I forget.
[4:04:56.560 --> 4:05:00.200]  And there's these big giant six foot four guys pushing people starting fights going,
[4:05:00.200 --> 4:05:01.200]  let's riot.
[4:05:01.200 --> 4:05:06.600]  And I'm like, you're cops, you're not some little foundation, you know, funded, I mean
[4:05:06.600 --> 4:05:11.640]  you're foundation funded, but not the normal little anarchist, meth head, trust fund kid
[4:05:11.640 --> 4:05:13.680]  with snot running down their nose.
[4:05:13.680 --> 4:05:17.600]  You are cops, and I started going, they're cops, they're cops, and going, I'm arresting
[4:05:17.600 --> 4:05:18.600]  you, citizens arrest.
[4:05:18.600 --> 4:05:21.960]  And this video was somewhere around the office, I've aired on Access TV back in the day many
[4:05:21.960 --> 4:05:26.280]  times, and cops run across the street going, stop it, Jones, those are our officers.
[4:05:26.280 --> 4:05:29.360]  And they uninsert those two and insert two more.
[4:05:29.360 --> 4:05:35.160]  These giant, royed head cops in bandanas going, ooh, trying to, and I, you know, they really
[4:05:35.160 --> 4:05:36.160]  get mad.
[4:05:36.160 --> 4:05:40.600]  And remember Denver last year, came out the Denver post, they had cops, attack cops.
[4:05:40.600 --> 4:05:47.920]  That was confirmed during testimony, given a response, the information, infamous Missouri
[4:05:47.920 --> 4:05:52.320]  information analysis center, the document authored by Missouri highway patrols already
[4:05:52.320 --> 4:05:53.400]  went over that.
[4:05:53.400 --> 4:05:57.480]  My group was at the end of the Fed rally, this is the testimony in legislature, my group
[4:05:57.480 --> 4:06:02.640]  was at the end of the Fed rally, and there were a bunch of different groups there.
[4:06:02.640 --> 4:06:07.360]  Just as he's bargain told Missouri house representatives on Monday, and there was a group of anarchists
[4:06:07.360 --> 4:06:13.840]  who started talking to us, and then they tried to recruit us or have us join their group.
[4:06:13.840 --> 4:06:17.320]  And you look at the video, it's, you've seen these cops once, you've seen them a million
[4:06:17.320 --> 4:06:18.320]  times.
[4:06:18.320 --> 4:06:25.480]  Then they started telling us that we should write on our signs and instructing us to letter
[4:06:25.480 --> 4:06:27.160]  them, rewrite some of our signs.
[4:06:27.160 --> 4:06:31.840]  Later we overheard them saying they couldn't even get us to J walk.
[4:06:31.840 --> 4:06:35.240]  So they're like, damn, we can't get them to even J walk and it's big old giant cops.
[4:06:35.240 --> 4:06:39.920]  I mean, it's just, because they, you know, the cops that they were smart would put in
[4:06:39.920 --> 4:06:44.320]  smaller cops, but they're so afraid of protesters that they put their biggest, toughest guys
[4:06:44.320 --> 4:06:48.360]  like, it's a deadly mission, men, you're going to go commit crimes and try to stir up people
[4:06:48.360 --> 4:06:50.760]  to commit crimes so we can violate the First Amendment.
[4:06:50.760 --> 4:06:54.400]  Are you willing to go in with these grandmas and people that are against foreign banking
[4:06:54.400 --> 4:06:55.400]  domination?
[4:06:55.400 --> 4:06:58.720]  Oh my God, we better send our biggest men in there.
[4:06:58.720 --> 4:07:05.560]  They're so deadly, it's just ridiculous and these guys will be scared of you when they
[4:07:05.560 --> 4:07:08.240]  saddle up to you at an event and say, Hey, you want to blow something up?
[4:07:08.240 --> 4:07:11.280]  They're kind of like, you'll see them kind of shaking when they're like, dude, I'm not
[4:07:11.280 --> 4:07:12.280]  scary here.
[4:07:12.280 --> 4:07:13.280]  I'm an American.
[4:07:13.280 --> 4:07:20.080]  I know you're a little criminal and all, but anyways, it goes on during the April 2009
[4:07:20.080 --> 4:07:21.080]  G 20 summit in London.
[4:07:21.080 --> 4:07:25.640]  Police stood back and watch anarchist attack banks, other buildings in an incident that
[4:07:25.640 --> 4:07:28.640]  had all the hallmarks of a staged event.
[4:07:28.640 --> 4:07:32.400]  Some of the SPP protests in Canada, Quebec provincial authorities were forced to admit
[4:07:32.400 --> 4:07:38.480]  that the three rock-wielding black mask wearing anarchists were in fact police infiltrators
[4:07:38.480 --> 4:07:42.720]  used to gather information on protesters that they staged a fake arrest.
[4:07:42.720 --> 4:07:46.680]  And then it just goes into police state to the takeover where I document the police admitting
[4:07:46.680 --> 4:07:52.720]  that the major foundations brought in anarchists and the Delta force commanded them.
[4:07:52.720 --> 4:07:54.880]  That was in all three Seattle newspapers.
[4:07:54.880 --> 4:07:57.360]  I mean, folks, it just goes on and on.
[4:07:57.360 --> 4:08:03.880]  Now let me briefly get into some of this call Colorado, GOP Colorado, GOP calls for apology
[4:08:03.880 --> 4:08:06.040]  after democratic office vandalism.
[4:08:06.040 --> 4:08:08.720]  This is out of Fox news.
[4:08:08.720 --> 4:08:11.680]  Also have one here out of the Denver Post, the chairman of the Colorado Republican Party
[4:08:11.680 --> 4:08:14.640]  is calling on the Democratic counterpart to apologize.
[4:08:14.640 --> 4:08:19.080]  Following comments, he claims connects an active vandalism to opposition of President Barack
[4:08:19.080 --> 4:08:22.040]  Obama's healthcare reform.
[4:08:22.040 --> 4:08:27.920]  And then it turns out that it was a staff worker of the DNC there in Denver that supposedly
[4:08:27.920 --> 4:08:31.800]  did all this.
[4:08:31.800 --> 4:08:35.920]  So again, every time I see it in the news where somebody puts a swastika on their dorm
[4:08:35.920 --> 4:08:41.480]  or burns down the black church, it's always one of the church members of the dorm member
[4:08:41.480 --> 4:08:44.360]  or I mean, it just never ends.
[4:08:44.360 --> 4:08:47.560]  I mean, I've never seen a modern case.
[4:08:47.560 --> 4:08:53.560]  And then even the Klan bombing black churches in Alabama and in places in Louisiana, it
[4:08:53.560 --> 4:08:56.960]  came out where FBI informants doing it.
[4:08:56.960 --> 4:08:59.400]  I mean, it never ends.
[4:08:59.400 --> 4:09:01.840]  So we've got that report.
[4:09:01.840 --> 4:09:09.520]  Neo Nazi rally was organized by FBI informant Orlando sent in it Orlando sentinel I start
[4:09:09.520 --> 4:09:10.520]  messing up when I go too fast.
[4:09:10.520 --> 4:09:11.520]  I'm going to take my time.
[4:09:11.520 --> 4:09:15.240]  We're going to go to your calls a minute Orlando sentinel, Neo Nazi rally was organized
[4:09:15.240 --> 4:09:18.360]  by FBI informant and he set it up.
[4:09:18.360 --> 4:09:23.760]  He ran the whole thing folks up into the Nazi rallies here in Austin to protest him, you
[4:09:23.760 --> 4:09:27.440]  know, going bullhorn the Klan and the Nazis and you're looking at them.
[4:09:27.440 --> 4:09:31.960]  And I mean, these aren't even white people that are dressed up like Nazis.
[4:09:31.960 --> 4:09:37.320]  I mean, they can't even, I guess, get ADL workers or Southern probably law center people
[4:09:37.320 --> 4:09:38.480]  to get up there and do it.
[4:09:38.480 --> 4:09:40.720]  I mean, I mean, it's ridiculous.
[4:09:40.720 --> 4:09:43.960]  I mean, it's totally fake.
[4:09:43.960 --> 4:09:47.760]  Just like the grand son of the head of the ADL is the spokesman for al-Qaeda.
[4:09:47.760 --> 4:09:53.880]  I mean, and they've done the video layers off the al-Qaeda watermark and the Intel center
[4:09:53.880 --> 4:09:56.520]  logo and it's the same video layer.
[4:09:56.520 --> 4:09:57.520]  They're producing these.
[4:09:57.520 --> 4:09:58.520]  These are fake.
[4:09:58.520 --> 4:09:59.520]  Okay.
[4:09:59.520 --> 4:10:04.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, of course, we broke that and then wired magazine months later reported
[4:10:04.000 --> 4:10:05.000]  on it.
[4:10:05.000 --> 4:10:08.880]  Then he got threats and said, well, it looks like it was the same video layer.
[4:10:08.880 --> 4:10:12.840]  Well, it's, we can look in here in our primitive computers and blow it up and see it's in the
[4:10:12.840 --> 4:10:17.000]  same layer.
[4:10:17.000 --> 4:10:20.080]  Neo-Nazi rally was organized by FBI informants.
[4:10:20.080 --> 4:10:21.840]  So that's Orlando Sentinel.
[4:10:21.840 --> 4:10:22.840]  Here's a London telegraph.
[4:10:22.840 --> 4:10:26.760]  Germany's top neo-Nazi spied for ministry.
[4:10:26.760 --> 4:10:31.120]  Then it goes into admitting that they actually staged fire bombings and attacks under German
[4:10:31.120 --> 4:10:33.000]  intelligence orders.
[4:10:33.000 --> 4:10:34.000]  Here's another one.
[4:10:34.000 --> 4:10:37.640]  White power rally leader was FBI snitch law center reports.
[4:10:37.640 --> 4:10:41.840]  The FBI says, yes, he did work for us, but not when he made the latest threats that shows
[4:10:41.840 --> 4:10:45.200]  how they burn their own people.
[4:10:45.200 --> 4:10:47.280]  Hal Turner and Mitzi work for the FBI.
[4:10:47.280 --> 4:10:48.280]  That's another one.
[4:10:48.280 --> 4:10:52.040]  Canadian Jewish Congress organized Nazi party.
[4:10:52.040 --> 4:11:00.240]  And this actually came out in the Ottawa newspaper, the Ottawa citizen.
[4:11:00.240 --> 4:11:05.760]  Neo-Nazi leader was MI6 agent, London guardian again, commanding it, running the attacks.
[4:11:05.760 --> 4:11:10.160]  Here, let's continue Fox News ministers, police destroyed clan records.
[4:11:10.160 --> 4:11:14.800]  And then it comes out because the clan was working for the police carrying out the attacks.
[4:11:14.800 --> 4:11:16.320]  Fox News, AP.
[4:11:16.320 --> 4:11:19.920]  Why did the Jewish Congress build up the Nazi party?
[4:11:19.920 --> 4:11:22.680]  That's Ezra Levitt's website.
[4:11:22.680 --> 4:11:23.680]  Here's another one.
[4:11:23.680 --> 4:11:28.040]  New OKC revelation, spotlight, FBI involvement in bombing.
[4:11:28.040 --> 4:11:32.240]  And this came out in the Salt Lake City Tribune, southern poverty law center involved with
[4:11:32.240 --> 4:11:33.240]  informants inside.
[4:11:33.240 --> 4:11:36.360]  That's why I'm their number one target because I expose them.
[4:11:36.360 --> 4:11:41.600]  Again, how did the British intelligence control India when there was one Brit in many areas
[4:11:41.600 --> 4:11:43.200]  for every thousand Indians?
[4:11:43.200 --> 4:11:47.200]  They would play tribal groups off against each other, religious groups off against each
[4:11:47.200 --> 4:11:48.200]  other.
[4:11:48.200 --> 4:11:53.800]  It's called the great game or divide and conquer.
[4:11:53.800 --> 4:11:58.960]  And here's that actual Salt Lake City affidavit McVeigh had high level help working for Army
[4:11:58.960 --> 4:12:00.120]  intelligence.
[4:12:00.120 --> 4:12:03.520]  Again, southern poverty law center.
[4:12:03.520 --> 4:12:11.080]  Attorney, sealed documents indicate OKC inside bombing, FBI defense team files identify government
[4:12:11.080 --> 4:12:12.600]  informants directing McVeigh.
[4:12:12.600 --> 4:12:15.520]  Oh, I can go on for hours here.
[4:12:15.520 --> 4:12:17.000]  This is not a game or not a joke.
[4:12:17.000 --> 4:12:22.280]  And that's why I tell good old boys a certain macho type that we've assessed who tend to
[4:12:22.280 --> 4:12:25.520]  have their father was in the military or their brother was.
[4:12:25.520 --> 4:12:26.520]  They weren't.
[4:12:26.520 --> 4:12:29.080]  They like Rambo movies.
[4:12:29.080 --> 4:12:33.720]  I've actually gone out several times just to assess these groups myself.
[4:12:33.720 --> 4:12:35.880]  And you'll see there'll be a fed in the group of 10 guys.
[4:12:35.880 --> 4:12:37.960]  He's trying to get them to do violent stuff.
[4:12:37.960 --> 4:12:41.200]  And the other guys will be putting bandanas on and crawling around in the bushes.
[4:12:41.200 --> 4:12:47.800]  And they think everybody's out to get them and they want to have some big battle with
[4:12:47.800 --> 4:12:48.800]  the government.
[4:12:48.800 --> 4:12:50.960]  And they're always being led by feds.
[4:12:50.960 --> 4:12:51.960]  This is the M.O.
[4:12:51.960 --> 4:12:56.240]  I mean, take the Republic of Texas poll show over half of Texans want us to see from the
[4:12:56.240 --> 4:12:59.240]  union, whether that's good or not.
[4:12:59.240 --> 4:13:02.800]  So they went out and found literally poor people living in trailers.
[4:13:02.800 --> 4:13:06.240]  They said, I am the president and they would have a guy with a bass boat who would wear
[4:13:06.240 --> 4:13:07.240]  admiral outfits.
[4:13:07.240 --> 4:13:09.040]  I mean, you can't make this up.
[4:13:09.040 --> 4:13:12.240]  And then the cops went in there and just gunned them all down.
[4:13:12.240 --> 4:13:14.680]  And so they were dangerous terrorists.
[4:13:14.680 --> 4:13:15.680]  And then they have other groups.
[4:13:15.680 --> 4:13:23.280]  They hired look like clowns to discredit any true secession movement down the road.
[4:13:23.280 --> 4:13:25.040]  It's very simple.
[4:13:25.040 --> 4:13:29.720]  So if you're going to be in a militia, realize it's constitutional, it's good.
[4:13:29.720 --> 4:13:33.840]  Realize that you only act in defense of the Republic and realize anybody that tells you
[4:13:33.840 --> 4:13:34.840]  you got to be secretive.
[4:13:34.840 --> 4:13:36.040]  You got to hide in the bushes.
[4:13:36.040 --> 4:13:37.560]  Oh, let's make pipe bombs.
[4:13:37.560 --> 4:13:40.600]  Oh, let's make our guns go full auto.
[4:13:40.600 --> 4:13:46.040]  If you'll just follow that person home, their FBI, their defense intelligence, their army
[4:13:46.040 --> 4:13:48.040]  special forces.
[4:13:48.040 --> 4:13:52.000]  I mean, I've one time I went and tried to cover Brooksville, Florida and an army takeover
[4:13:52.000 --> 4:13:53.000]  drill of the town.
[4:13:53.000 --> 4:14:02.880]  And I get there and locals are running around when I get to Brooksville, I'm walking through
[4:14:02.880 --> 4:14:03.880]  the town.
[4:14:03.880 --> 4:14:04.880]  This is a big town.
[4:14:04.880 --> 4:14:06.720]  And I'm people are coming out going, you're Alex Jones.
[4:14:06.720 --> 4:14:08.640]  The army came to my door and said, don't talk to you.
[4:14:08.640 --> 4:14:09.640]  You're crazy.
[4:14:09.640 --> 4:14:12.600]  This was all a style of how to take over the town.
[4:14:12.600 --> 4:14:15.000]  And then all of a sudden this guy had seen it wake up in other places.
[4:14:15.000 --> 4:14:19.600]  It was clearly, and I knew instantly what was special forces, you know, totally, you
[4:14:19.600 --> 4:14:23.560]  know, but serious and he was always, and he's like, oh, let's set fires that while we're
[4:14:23.560 --> 4:14:24.560]  here in Brooksville.
[4:14:24.560 --> 4:14:27.440]  I'm like, I had to literally grab him and throw him down the ground and go, look, I
[4:14:27.440 --> 4:14:28.440]  know you're fed.
[4:14:28.440 --> 4:14:29.720]  I'm about to kick your ass.
[4:14:29.720 --> 4:14:33.120]  I don't care how tough you think you are, quit following us around.
[4:14:33.120 --> 4:14:36.920]  We're just trying to videotape them setting up checkpoints in the town.
[4:14:36.920 --> 4:14:40.960]  And I had to literally grab this guy and just go, listen, because once he started trying
[4:14:40.960 --> 4:14:43.800]  to light stuff on fire and I grabbed him and I had to show him down and said, I know you
[4:14:43.800 --> 4:14:44.800]  think you're tough.
[4:14:44.800 --> 4:14:47.440]  I'm about to kick the living hell out of you.
[4:14:47.440 --> 4:14:49.800]  You understand me, you federal piece of crap.
[4:14:49.800 --> 4:14:50.800]  I said a lot more than that.
[4:14:50.800 --> 4:14:54.320]  And I said, I'm going to stomp your guts out.
[4:14:54.320 --> 4:14:59.280]  Now that's the type of crap that I deal with with these criminals and I am sick of it.
[4:14:59.280 --> 4:15:04.960]  And I declare war on your criminal activity, period.
[4:15:04.960 --> 4:15:08.640]  So I'm going to tell people who are involved in this militia stuff, you better keep your
[4:15:08.640 --> 4:15:11.280]  nose clean because the feds want to set you up.
[4:15:11.280 --> 4:15:12.680]  Let's go to Charles in Rhode Island.
[4:15:12.680 --> 4:15:14.680]  Charles, are you in a militia?
[4:15:14.680 --> 4:15:17.680]  Yes, I am.
[4:15:17.680 --> 4:15:20.680]  What's on your mind?
[4:15:20.680 --> 4:15:25.680]  Well, basically, Rhode Island is a very small state, it's a two by four of a state.
[4:15:25.680 --> 4:15:30.440]  So it would be extremely hard to be infiltrated into militia because of the fact that we would
[4:15:30.440 --> 4:15:36.920]  know you 12 ways by 12 ways very easily to contact there, get you to assemble.
[4:15:36.920 --> 4:15:42.120]  So basically I've been the representative of the militia down at the state house for
[4:15:42.120 --> 4:15:45.200]  the past 25 years here in the state of Rhode Island.
[4:15:45.200 --> 4:15:50.800]  Well, God bless you, you're in the great tradition of General Green from Rhode Island.
[4:15:50.800 --> 4:15:51.800]  Exactly.
[4:15:51.800 --> 4:15:56.480]  And we're here to help the people who own the government, not the people in government,
[4:15:56.480 --> 4:15:59.480]  but who collect the checks from the government that can work.
[4:15:59.480 --> 4:16:00.480]  Okay?
[4:16:00.480 --> 4:16:05.520]  So, by the time you're after the government collapses, we're trying to maintain the sanity
[4:16:05.520 --> 4:16:13.360]  that the government is taking away for a matter of seconds to the laws and all, all the crazy
[4:16:13.360 --> 4:16:17.840]  laws that we're getting inoculated with.
[4:16:17.840 --> 4:16:24.640]  Well, for people that, I mean, give us your view, I mean, do you agree with my statement
[4:16:24.640 --> 4:16:29.200]  that people see a massive tyranny building up, just like people internally tried to fight
[4:16:29.200 --> 4:16:34.160]  back against Hitler and were called traitors, I mean, you see a huge tyranny being constructed
[4:16:34.160 --> 4:16:36.840]  that people go, well, we better revive the militia.
[4:16:36.840 --> 4:16:41.240]  I mean, it's federal law that we all be part of it, 18 to 44 anyways.
[4:16:41.240 --> 4:16:45.000]  Well, absolutely, I agree with you.
[4:16:45.000 --> 4:16:50.520]  And this is the part, as I was overeducated, I understand exactly what happened in Nazi
[4:16:50.520 --> 4:16:56.560]  Germany after the Red Star Fire, 1933 and 1934, and the laws are all being repeated
[4:16:56.560 --> 4:16:58.840]  right here in America, right at this moment.
[4:16:58.840 --> 4:17:04.320]  And my grandfather told me in 1966, he said, by the time I get to be his age, not to get
[4:17:04.320 --> 4:17:08.280]  the social security number, because by the time I get to be his age, there would be no
[4:17:08.280 --> 4:17:12.160]  money for me to collect because the government will have successfully stolen every penny.
[4:17:12.160 --> 4:17:16.760]  Well, he had no idea the fear that credit money system that was going to unfold, but
[4:17:16.760 --> 4:17:20.880]  because of what he told me, and I follow his directions, I have no social security, I've
[4:17:20.880 --> 4:17:25.000]  never paid any of the tax, the federal federal, and I don't believe in any of that, I don't
[4:17:25.000 --> 4:17:29.880]  understand why we're doing those things at all, tapping up the government to make up
[4:17:29.880 --> 4:17:33.520]  those ways, it doesn't make any sense to me.
[4:17:33.520 --> 4:17:36.200]  God bless you, sir, good to hear from you.
[4:17:36.200 --> 4:17:37.200]  Long live the Republic.
[4:17:37.200 --> 4:17:40.760]  Mike in South Carolina, you're on the air, go ahead, Mike.
[4:17:40.760 --> 4:17:43.280]  Hello Alex, thank you for your show.
[4:17:43.280 --> 4:17:44.280]  Thank you.
[4:17:44.280 --> 4:17:49.080]  Okay, you've got the international media here, tell them why you're in the militia.
[4:17:49.080 --> 4:17:54.800]  Well, because it's not an option, by definition, every able-bodied male is the militia to
[4:17:54.800 --> 4:18:00.880]  be ever ready to be the number one primary deterrent against tyranny.
[4:18:00.880 --> 4:18:09.800]  And having said that, many are ignorant and many are AWOL, but nevertheless, they are
[4:18:09.800 --> 4:18:10.800]  the militia.
[4:18:10.800 --> 4:18:17.240]  And remember what our founder said, when the government fears the people, you have freedom.
[4:18:17.240 --> 4:18:20.920]  When the people fear the government, you have tyranny.
[4:18:20.920 --> 4:18:26.840]  So it's up to each and every individual to judge where we are in that continuum and
[4:18:26.840 --> 4:18:33.720]  to be ready for action when we get to that point.
[4:18:33.720 --> 4:18:36.800]  Well sir, I agree with you, you've got the floor, continue with any other points you'd
[4:18:36.800 --> 4:18:37.800]  like to make.
[4:18:37.800 --> 4:18:43.200]  Well, just like to remind everybody, like you said, agree with you 100%, anything more
[4:18:43.200 --> 4:18:52.200]  than probably two, maybe three, organized, is going to be infiltrated eventually.
[4:18:52.200 --> 4:18:58.680]  So the bottom line is, the militia is like the biblical militia, God's army.
[4:18:58.680 --> 4:19:03.520]  They go about their everyday business, but they're ever ready, each individual responsible
[4:19:03.520 --> 4:19:07.680]  to have a quality rifle, ample supply of ammunition, be proficient in its use.
[4:19:07.680 --> 4:19:13.320]  Exactly, that's the model is that, I see these militia guys that are federally handled
[4:19:13.320 --> 4:19:18.120]  in the camo, running around bragging with their chest stuck out, real militias in a
[4:19:18.120 --> 4:19:22.440]  suit and tie at city council, and then they're in their backyard wearing a t-shirt doing gardening
[4:19:22.440 --> 4:19:26.560]  and they're lovingly rocking their baby at night, but they're also going to the shooting
[4:19:26.560 --> 4:19:31.120]  range, getting ready, committing to how they're going to defend the republic against this
[4:19:31.120 --> 4:19:34.800]  globalist takeover if they start trying to put us in FEMA camps.
[4:19:34.800 --> 4:19:39.600]  I mean, it's that simple, and that's the real army, and the system knows that.
[4:19:39.600 --> 4:19:44.520]  That's why they staged the attacks in the 90s to demonize the militia, so the real men
[4:19:44.520 --> 4:19:47.800]  who saw the threat to the country would be scared away from it.
[4:19:47.800 --> 4:19:48.800]  It hasn't worked.
[4:19:48.800 --> 4:19:53.200]  The feds doing that in the mid-90s only made the real militia go underground, and it's
[4:19:53.200 --> 4:20:01.080]  just this giant army that is just to use the Frank Herbert analogy of like the Fremen.
[4:20:01.080 --> 4:20:02.080]  It's just gigantic.
[4:20:02.080 --> 4:20:08.120]  Absolutely correct, and that's the ones they're afraid of, and I'm here to tell you that I'm
[4:20:08.120 --> 4:20:13.800]  convinced, God willing, we will be the majority when we're called about the Holy Spirit.
[4:20:13.800 --> 4:20:19.220]  They call us lone wolves because we're not out there playing GI Joe.
[4:20:19.220 --> 4:20:25.040]  We are out there working, earning a living, taking care of our families, voting.
[4:20:25.040 --> 4:20:26.880]  We're going to town hall meetings.
[4:20:26.880 --> 4:20:30.800]  We're screaming to the top of our lungs at these boneheads in Washington, these town
[4:20:30.800 --> 4:20:35.080]  hall meetings, but the bottom line is we practice on our own.
[4:20:35.080 --> 4:20:36.080]  We train.
[4:20:36.080 --> 4:20:37.720]  We're very, very proficient.
[4:20:37.720 --> 4:20:41.320]  We don't get together and brag about this and have some kind of party and club and talk
[4:20:41.320 --> 4:20:43.160]  about how wonderful we are.
[4:20:43.160 --> 4:20:49.840]  We understand the position that's God-given and enumerated by our founders, and we're
[4:20:49.840 --> 4:20:53.720]  prepared for the day when it happens, and remember, there's over 100 million gun owners
[4:20:53.720 --> 4:20:59.760]  in this country, over 300 million farms, and remember throughout all of history, freedom
[4:20:59.760 --> 4:21:02.680]  has been born on the shoulder of about 10%.
[4:21:02.680 --> 4:21:10.800]  The other 90% even was split, 45% pro-king, 45% didn't care, so 10% of 100 million gun
[4:21:10.800 --> 4:21:14.720]  owners, 10 million, there's no army in the world can stand up to that, and that's reason
[4:21:14.720 --> 4:21:18.800]  the Japanese didn't invade us because they know virtually all Americans are not only
[4:21:18.800 --> 4:21:22.640]  armed but well-armed and willing to do what they have to do to defend them.
[4:21:22.640 --> 4:21:23.640]  That's right.
[4:21:23.640 --> 4:21:24.640]  That's right.
[4:21:24.640 --> 4:21:27.560]  Admiral Yamamoto didn't just say, I fear we have woken a sleeping giant.
[4:21:27.560 --> 4:21:32.400]  He also said we can't invade the mainland because there'd be a rifle barrel behind every
[4:21:32.400 --> 4:21:35.760]  blade of grass, and that's what the foreign bankers need to know.
[4:21:35.760 --> 4:21:41.120]  We've identified the Federal Reserve as the outside enemy engaging in the criminal activity,
[4:21:41.120 --> 4:21:42.800]  the implosion of the economy by design.
[4:21:42.800 --> 4:21:48.120]  We are peacefully saying, stop raping us, stop abusing us, don't tread on us.
[4:21:48.120 --> 4:21:50.000]  We're trying everything peaceable we can.
[4:21:50.000 --> 4:21:51.000]  The enemy is arrogant.
[4:21:51.000 --> 4:21:55.880]  They're going to strike against us, and then everybody knows who the enemy is.
[4:21:55.880 --> 4:21:58.920]  We have a question here for you from the TV network.
[4:21:58.920 --> 4:21:59.920]  Go ahead.
[4:21:59.920 --> 4:22:04.320]  Mike, do you train publicly, or have you gone underground?
[4:22:04.320 --> 4:22:06.720]  I'm not underground whatsoever.
[4:22:06.720 --> 4:22:11.640]  I'm probably on every list in the country, but proudly so.
[4:22:11.640 --> 4:22:16.720]  I emulate what my founders did, and the founders said that we either stick together or we'll
[4:22:16.720 --> 4:22:17.720]  hang separately.
[4:22:17.720 --> 4:22:22.040]  We'll hang together, hang separately, and I utilize public ranges.
[4:22:22.040 --> 4:22:24.920]  I train on a regular basis.
[4:22:24.920 --> 4:22:29.840]  Yeah, by underground, the mainstream media underground means he doesn't go join a federal
[4:22:29.840 --> 4:22:35.520]  group with a big, fat FBI agent going, I don't like black people, I don't like these,
[4:22:35.520 --> 4:22:37.800]  machine guns, we're going to kill.
[4:22:37.800 --> 4:22:38.800]  That's a big, fat fed.
[4:22:38.800 --> 4:22:42.520]  I mean, I just, I can give you hundreds of articles.
[4:22:42.520 --> 4:22:47.400]  In the court cases, the feds go and bury pipe bombs on their member's property.
[4:22:47.400 --> 4:22:51.160]  I mean, these are, the BATF is just scum you can't even imagine.
[4:22:51.160 --> 4:22:54.160]  I mean, these are mafia people.
[4:22:54.160 --> 4:22:59.000]  So Mike, who do you, who are you training to, to eventually fight then?
[4:22:59.000 --> 4:23:00.000]  Who's your enemy?
[4:23:00.000 --> 4:23:07.400]  You'll know who your enemy is, and I'll say this, 26 years, military service, and a decade
[4:23:07.400 --> 4:23:13.800]  as a peace officer, and you will clearly know who your enemy is because they'll be shooting
[4:23:13.800 --> 4:23:14.800]  at you.
[4:23:14.800 --> 4:23:18.800]  If they kick your door down, or they stick a gun in your face, they're your enemy.
[4:23:18.800 --> 4:23:24.360]  And it's just the bottom line, and the bottom line, it sums everything up, the line in the
[4:23:24.360 --> 4:23:27.240]  stand is the firearms.
[4:23:27.240 --> 4:23:31.960]  The powers that be, the international bankers, like Alex was talking about, be it the federal
[4:23:31.960 --> 4:23:38.120]  government, be it the BATF, be it the lawmakers in Washington, they know, they're not stupid.
[4:23:38.120 --> 4:23:39.280]  They've studied history.
[4:23:39.280 --> 4:23:45.800]  They know that they have to get the firearms before they can enact their final plan.
[4:23:45.800 --> 4:23:51.200]  And that's 1775, they came for the guns then, and when they want their war, they're going
[4:23:51.200 --> 4:23:52.200]  to get it.
[4:23:52.200 --> 4:23:53.600]  But they're the aggressor.
[4:23:53.600 --> 4:23:55.080]  We're in the right.
[4:23:55.080 --> 4:23:57.720]  And hopefully they'll get more than they bargained for.
[4:23:57.720 --> 4:23:59.920]  So it's your idea that you won't shoot first?
[4:23:59.920 --> 4:24:00.920]  Oh, absolutely not.
[4:24:00.920 --> 4:24:01.920]  It's strictly defensive.
[4:24:01.920 --> 4:24:08.640]  It's the preparation, it's the ultimate preparation to be, to be defensive, but in 1776, like Alex
[4:24:08.640 --> 4:24:11.240]  brought up, we didn't shoot first either.
[4:24:11.240 --> 4:24:13.320]  They come over to get the guns, and they stuck guns in our face.
[4:24:13.320 --> 4:24:18.040]  They come marching down the road, and that's how you know who your enemy is.
[4:24:18.040 --> 4:24:20.280]  All right, good to hear from you, sir.
[4:24:20.280 --> 4:24:21.280]  God bless you.
[4:24:21.280 --> 4:24:23.000]  Rick in Texas, we've got to go quick here now.
[4:24:23.000 --> 4:24:26.280]  I've got a long way to go and a short time to get there.
[4:24:26.280 --> 4:24:27.880]  Rick in Texas, you're on the air.
[4:24:27.880 --> 4:24:29.840]  Hey, thank you a lot.
[4:24:29.840 --> 4:24:38.240]  Alex, like the other caller just said, this is an inherent right that Americans have,
[4:24:38.240 --> 4:24:40.760]  and they basically lost touch with it.
[4:24:40.760 --> 4:24:47.840]  Our second amendment was to give the people the ultimate power and a voice over government
[4:24:47.840 --> 4:24:48.840]  at all times.
[4:24:48.840 --> 4:24:49.840]  It's the Trump time.
[4:24:49.840 --> 4:24:50.840]  Pardon?
[4:24:50.840 --> 4:24:53.840]  It's the teeth of the Constitution.
[4:24:53.840 --> 4:24:54.840]  Correct.
[4:24:54.840 --> 4:24:57.840]  And what you said is correct.
[4:24:57.840 --> 4:25:03.400]  This is a constitutional thing, it's a legal thing.
[4:25:03.400 --> 4:25:10.040]  Anybody that doesn't go along with, oh, what you say, doing it in a peaceable professional
[4:25:10.040 --> 4:25:11.040]  manner?
[4:25:11.040 --> 4:25:14.920]  Well, we need to look the other way there, because you're absolutely right.
[4:25:14.920 --> 4:25:19.040]  They're in there causing trouble for the reason they've only got one entity out there to cause
[4:25:19.040 --> 4:25:20.040]  a problem.
[4:25:20.040 --> 4:25:25.360]  That's the feds, or the federal government, or elected officials.
[4:25:25.360 --> 4:25:32.360]  I myself have always stood out front, never been embarrassed about where I stood with
[4:25:32.360 --> 4:25:33.360]  our second amendment.
[4:25:33.360 --> 4:25:41.280]  Yes, see, the establishment runs from the real militia, who's a well-spoken, handsome,
[4:25:41.280 --> 4:25:42.600]  serious, focused person.
[4:25:42.600 --> 4:25:45.440]  They go to the clowns, and the clowns are feds.
[4:25:45.440 --> 4:25:48.720]  It's a make-believe.
[4:25:48.720 --> 4:25:52.880]  And then the feds, sometimes you'll have 14, 15 feds with two or three idiots.
[4:25:52.880 --> 4:25:53.880]  They find it bars.
[4:25:53.880 --> 4:25:57.160]  And they'll give you, I'll give you 10,000 to wear the uniform, Bill.
[4:25:57.160 --> 4:26:00.000]  Bill, we could take over the Capitol, we could be kings.
[4:26:00.000 --> 4:26:04.440]  I mean, this came out in Texas monthly when they created a fake Klan grit.
[4:26:04.440 --> 4:26:07.600]  And they gave them tens of thousands of dollars, and said, I'll give you more money if you'll
[4:26:07.600 --> 4:26:12.200]  build a black powder bomb, and the guy was so drunk he didn't know how, so the FBI made
[4:26:12.200 --> 4:26:18.520]  the bomb and videoed and put it on the news, deadly white supremacist Klan militia.
[4:26:18.520 --> 4:26:20.480]  They demonized the militia by using that term.
[4:26:20.480 --> 4:26:22.840]  It was all just made up.
[4:26:22.840 --> 4:26:25.040]  It was white trash welfare heads.
[4:26:25.040 --> 4:26:26.240]  It's just all fake.
[4:26:26.240 --> 4:26:27.360]  It's fake.
[4:26:27.360 --> 4:26:28.360]  It's fake.
[4:26:28.360 --> 4:26:33.280]  And they go find toothless ne'er-do-wells that they can burn and put in a supermax
[4:26:33.280 --> 4:26:34.280]  prison.
[4:26:34.280 --> 4:26:36.200]  I mean, that's it.
[4:26:36.200 --> 4:26:38.600]  Everybody else is just above board.
[4:26:38.600 --> 4:26:42.640]  And you got public people, like the folks that are calling in, you have all those that
[4:26:42.640 --> 4:26:43.640]  are quiet.
[4:26:43.640 --> 4:26:47.800]  But a lot of people calling in, I would imagine, are leaders in their local area, and that's
[4:26:47.800 --> 4:26:49.840]  kind of their function.
[4:26:49.840 --> 4:26:50.840]  Am I guessing right, Rick?
[4:26:50.840 --> 4:26:51.840]  Yeah, you're absolutely correct.
[4:26:51.840 --> 4:26:56.960]  Some of us have absolutely took it a completely different direction.
[4:26:56.960 --> 4:27:02.400]  And I've actually created a website that educates all Americans on the Second Amendment.
[4:27:02.400 --> 4:27:07.200]  And here we go, busting the race card down the middle, if you was to go look at my website.
[4:27:07.200 --> 4:27:08.880]  It's every American.
[4:27:08.880 --> 4:27:13.560]  It's not just white folks, it's not black folks, it's not, it's all of us.
[4:27:13.560 --> 4:27:15.560]  Give the website out.
[4:27:15.560 --> 4:27:26.560]  It's called the Well-Regulated American Militias, and it can be found at httpmilitias.name.com.
[4:27:26.560 --> 4:27:27.560]  All right.
[4:27:27.560 --> 4:27:28.560]  Thank you, sir.
[4:27:28.560 --> 4:27:29.560]  I appreciate the call, Rick.
[4:27:29.560 --> 4:27:31.080]  I'm going to take four more calls.
[4:27:31.080 --> 4:27:33.080]  Casey in California, you're on the air.
[4:27:33.080 --> 4:27:34.080]  How you doing, Alex?
[4:27:34.080 --> 4:27:35.080]  How are you doing?
[4:27:35.080 --> 4:27:36.080]  Good.
[4:27:36.080 --> 4:27:37.080]  God bless you 100%.
[4:27:37.080 --> 4:27:38.480]  I'm behind you a thousand percent.
[4:27:38.480 --> 4:27:44.360]  Real quick on your theory of basically earlier talking with Carol, and Carol, this is for
[4:27:44.360 --> 4:27:46.360]  you as well.
[4:27:46.360 --> 4:27:50.040]  I know there's lots of militias, but I think it's more along the lines of what Alex has
[4:27:50.040 --> 4:27:56.520]  in terms of about five or six guys or friends that go out and do their own training.
[4:27:56.520 --> 4:28:02.320]  Or whatever they do, to get together and, you know, when time comes, they're somewhat
[4:28:02.320 --> 4:28:04.320]  ready as opposed to, you know, a whole lot of work.
[4:28:04.320 --> 4:28:06.080]  Yeah, this is only done.
[4:28:06.080 --> 4:28:10.600]  This is done so if society breaks down, or they're trying to take people to FEMA camps,
[4:28:10.600 --> 4:28:13.720]  so they're doing this, that you got people to watch your back.
[4:28:13.720 --> 4:28:18.040]  I mean, this is people who are serious going, man, this government looks like Nazi Germany
[4:28:18.040 --> 4:28:23.000]  mixed with Stalin and Mao, and Pol Pot, an old sprinkling of Fidel Castro.
[4:28:23.000 --> 4:28:24.520]  We better protect our families.
[4:28:24.520 --> 4:28:29.320]  I mean, for anybody that has any history, any education, that's why there's so many
[4:28:29.320 --> 4:28:33.120]  military people and police in this, because they know what they're looking at.
[4:28:33.120 --> 4:28:35.160]  I mean, this walks like a duck, quacks like a duck.
[4:28:35.160 --> 4:28:36.160]  It's a duck.
[4:28:36.160 --> 4:28:37.160]  Anything else, sir?
[4:28:37.160 --> 4:28:38.160]  Yes.
[4:28:38.160 --> 4:28:39.160]  Yes.
[4:28:39.160 --> 4:28:40.160]  A couple things.
[4:28:40.160 --> 4:28:45.240]  I will say that there's got to be others out there like me.
[4:28:45.240 --> 4:28:47.440]  I'm married, have kids, and I'm with you 100% on the kids.
[4:28:47.440 --> 4:28:48.440]  I love everybody's kids.
[4:28:48.440 --> 4:28:52.400]  And that is one of the reasons why, you know, you're going to be fighting for the cause
[4:28:52.400 --> 4:28:59.280]  or whatever, but the public can't so brainwash my spouse being one of them.
[4:28:59.280 --> 4:29:03.480]  It's hard to get through to them in terms of what is really going on.
[4:29:03.480 --> 4:29:06.960]  Everything you say, everything you do is a conspiracy theory or this or that, and it
[4:29:06.960 --> 4:29:13.160]  just goes to show how dumbed down, how validated, how brainwashed they really are.
[4:29:13.160 --> 4:29:19.760]  Well, look how far we've come, though, where huge amounts of people are waking up now.
[4:29:19.760 --> 4:29:20.760]  But God bless you.
[4:29:20.760 --> 4:29:21.760]  Good to hear from you, Casey.
[4:29:21.760 --> 4:29:22.800]  I love Jim and Utah.
[4:29:22.800 --> 4:29:23.800]  Jim, you're on the air.
[4:29:23.800 --> 4:29:24.800]  Yes, sir.
[4:29:24.800 --> 4:29:30.200]  First of all, I would like to say I appreciate the way you handled the call a couple of weeks
[4:29:30.200 --> 4:29:32.300]  from the little 13-year-old boy.
[4:29:32.300 --> 4:29:34.920]  I think that was very professional.
[4:29:34.920 --> 4:29:36.680]  And kudos to you for that.
[4:29:36.680 --> 4:29:44.080]  And, two, I'm not an active member of the militia, but I have informed people in my town and city
[4:29:44.080 --> 4:29:50.520]  council members and the pharmacists, and they are not going along with any program that
[4:29:50.520 --> 4:29:57.000]  government's god for them? Yeah, I mean really saying you're with the militia is saying you're
[4:29:57.000 --> 4:30:03.080]  going to defend the Bill of Rights and Constitution. When I had the idea seven years ago on air
[4:30:04.200 --> 4:30:09.320]  and it's our great listeners really deserve the credit for this, I said let's get groups together
[4:30:10.760 --> 4:30:16.520]  to write up city, county, and state ordinances in law saying here we protect the Bill of Rights
[4:30:16.520 --> 4:30:20.920]  and Constitution. They have their free speech zones sequestering our free speech. How about we
[4:30:20.920 --> 4:30:25.160]  say the city of Austin and the county of Travis County and the state of Texas and every other
[4:30:25.160 --> 4:30:30.840]  county, city, and state. Here the Bill of Rights and Constitution is honored. Here America is a
[4:30:30.840 --> 4:30:36.840]  good word, not a dirty word. Here George Washington is a good word, not a dirty word. Here the Gadsden
[4:30:36.840 --> 4:30:41.400]  flag is a symbol of liberty and freedom and eternal vigilance, not a symbol of bogeymen and
[4:30:41.400 --> 4:30:50.200]  something scary. And that is now, all these years later, close to 800 cities, five states,
[4:30:50.200 --> 4:30:55.320]  past laws saying we will not follow the Unconstitutional Patriot Act. And that's all we're
[4:30:55.320 --> 4:31:00.440]  saying now is look, you're not getting our guns, we're waking up, we see you arming against us,
[4:31:00.440 --> 4:31:04.440]  we see the government circling, the illegitimate government building up military force,
[4:31:04.440 --> 4:31:08.600]  circling around us, building these great armies, just like the Declaration of Independence talked
[4:31:08.600 --> 4:31:14.040]  about, stationing these paramilitary forces here. And we see what you're gearing up for and we see
[4:31:14.040 --> 4:31:20.840]  what your own documents state. And it's just like when a bully is sitting there punching
[4:31:20.840 --> 4:31:24.120]  you in the face and you go, look, you better stop, you better stop. People that have a
[4:31:24.120 --> 4:31:30.760]  long fuse, you better stop. And finally, you're just like, look, don't punch me again. And the
[4:31:30.760 --> 4:31:35.880]  line's in the sand. And if they try another Waco or Ruby Ridge or the feds blow up another
[4:31:35.880 --> 4:31:41.080]  Oklahoma city and try to blame it on us, it's not going to work. And the bankers need to know that
[4:31:41.080 --> 4:31:47.320]  they don't have mind control over us anymore. And it's over. It's over. I'm sorry, you don't get to
[4:31:47.320 --> 4:31:51.800]  have a Soviet red terror and butcher a bunch of us. You don't have, you know, you don't get to have
[4:31:51.800 --> 4:31:58.520]  your way with us. Anything else, Jim? Yes, sir. I'd like to say that the way I got your message out
[4:31:58.520 --> 4:32:06.840]  mostly because of the people here is I have a PA system with about 400 watts. And I just run my
[4:32:06.840 --> 4:32:12.600]  computer through it and I have jammed it for the last three months every day, peaceably and lawably,
[4:32:12.600 --> 4:32:18.760]  but to the effect where people has come to me and watched the puppet gov videos. And, you know,
[4:32:18.760 --> 4:32:23.960]  they're pissed. They are getting pissed. And they're not just going to come in this little town where
[4:32:23.960 --> 4:32:30.760]  I'm at and have their way. The raping days are over. So what you're saying is you blare from your
[4:32:30.760 --> 4:32:38.440]  house or your car, my radio show? I'll say I run your radio show through my PA system like a band
[4:32:38.440 --> 4:32:47.000]  would use and everybody around me from about 10 a.m. to about where your show ends. That's what
[4:32:47.000 --> 4:32:54.920]  they hear. I'd like to tell you that eFood Direct is really good. Thank you. God bless you. They
[4:32:54.920 --> 4:32:58.680]  are good sponsors. That's why that's the storeable foods company I use. So that's, that's who I
[4:32:58.680 --> 4:33:03.560]  promote. I don't promote anything I don't believe in. Thank you, Jim. Jason in Florida, then Robert
[4:33:03.560 --> 4:33:08.840]  in Kentucky, and we're going to shut this thing down. Go ahead, Jason. Hey, Alex, I'm a member of
[4:33:08.840 --> 4:33:14.760]  the Unorganized Militia. Welcome. How you doing? Just like your previous caller said,
[4:33:14.760 --> 4:33:19.800]  I don't see as much of a choice. I mean, everyone defined the federalist papers between
[4:33:19.800 --> 4:33:25.480]  able-bodied between 1845 is a, is a member of the Unorganized Militia. And that philosophically,
[4:33:25.480 --> 4:33:30.360]  that's because you cannot delegate your safety and security to somebody else. Can't be done.
[4:33:31.400 --> 4:33:35.880]  Well said. Anytime you delegate your authority, that'd be like if you had a business and you
[4:33:35.880 --> 4:33:41.080]  left it to somebody for 20 years, you'd come back, the blocks would be changed, and they'd say,
[4:33:41.080 --> 4:33:45.640]  get out of here. This is my business. And that's what government has said. And, and, and there,
[4:33:45.640 --> 4:33:51.000]  and people are tired of being pushed around and abused by it. And it's over. It's over. Let me
[4:33:51.000 --> 4:33:55.560]  give the establishment the message. It's over. That's why they put Obama in because, you know,
[4:33:55.560 --> 4:34:00.040]  we were criticizing Bush. He's just a puppet so they can invoke the race card and try to make
[4:34:00.040 --> 4:34:04.040]  it racial. And, you know, oh, if you say the government's socialists are too big, that's code
[4:34:04.040 --> 4:34:08.920]  for the N word. They're injecting race. They want to get everybody at each other's throats.
[4:34:08.920 --> 4:34:12.840]  But let me tell you, it's not working, folks. It's not working. People are coming together,
[4:34:12.840 --> 4:34:17.240]  black, white, old, young. It doesn't matter. And it's just beautiful and wonderful to see.
[4:34:17.240 --> 4:34:22.760]  And I'm just so honored to be involved in it. Thank you, Carol, for doing your own independent
[4:34:22.760 --> 4:34:27.400]  research into the militia. I think you might be surprised if you had any preconceived notions coming
[4:34:27.400 --> 4:34:34.040]  in about who might comprise the militia. Well, I did have preconceived notions because of what
[4:34:34.040 --> 4:34:39.800]  I saw in the 90s. And when I saw that there was a resurgence, I decided to take a look at it.
[4:34:39.800 --> 4:34:43.480]  Are you finding more and more people interested in what you're doing? Do you think there are more
[4:34:43.480 --> 4:34:48.920]  and more people doing this? Oh, yeah. Over the last couple of years, there's a lot more people.
[4:34:48.920 --> 4:34:53.320]  And they're ordinary people. You know, they're trade people. They're just like the stunts of
[4:34:53.320 --> 4:35:00.360]  liberty were. It's just the same thing. How do you think the media has portrayed you or whoever,
[4:35:00.360 --> 4:35:04.520]  the media or the government or whomever? How do you think you've been portrayed in the past?
[4:35:04.520 --> 4:35:10.280]  And is it wrong and why? Well, I don't take it personally. I mean, I think that's just a
[4:35:10.280 --> 4:35:16.280]  stigma that they perpetuate for a political reason. It's just black ops. It's just military.
[4:35:16.280 --> 4:35:21.160]  I mean, I mean, they lie and say there's no bills to have national compulsory service
[4:35:21.160 --> 4:35:24.680]  when the bills are introduced to Obama's given speeches for it. They'll,
[4:35:24.680 --> 4:35:30.040]  they want to make all this racial, too, so they can play groups off against each other
[4:35:31.080 --> 4:35:36.120]  and make it a racial issue when it's not. See, but that's not going to work. I mean,
[4:35:36.120 --> 4:35:42.360]  the more asinine the government, the media get, the more, I mean, the media keeps wondering
[4:35:42.360 --> 4:35:47.080]  why they're losing ratings, losing viewers and why nobody believes in anything they say now.
[4:35:47.080 --> 4:35:51.400]  And it's because everybody knows that the majority of what comes out of the mainstream
[4:35:51.400 --> 4:35:57.800]  media is a crock of baloney. It's over. I mean, I don't think the establishment realizes
[4:35:58.360 --> 4:36:02.040]  this is the beginning of the end. They're going to be able to kill a bunch of us and do a lot
[4:36:02.040 --> 4:36:06.120]  of horrible stuff and stage terror attacks on the military and say we did it and we've already
[4:36:06.120 --> 4:36:11.000]  caught them doing drills for it. It didn't going to work. It's over. This is a war they're going
[4:36:11.000 --> 4:36:17.080]  to lose. The people, the spirit of liberty has been ignited. The spirit of 1776 has risen and
[4:36:17.080 --> 4:36:23.480]  it's over. It's over. The new order is defeated. So do you think we're going to see Americans
[4:36:23.480 --> 4:36:27.160]  fighting Americans? Is that what's going to happen? You're going to see, you're going to see
[4:36:27.160 --> 4:36:31.960]  the feds try to march the military and police up against the American people and you're going to see,
[4:36:33.160 --> 4:36:38.120]  you're going to see the amazing things happen unless we're able to just get the word out and
[4:36:38.120 --> 4:36:42.520]  the establishment does the calculations and decides to back off. The smartest thing for the
[4:36:42.520 --> 4:36:48.040]  new order to do is to back off. And the worldly side of me would like things to not become tumultuous
[4:36:48.040 --> 4:36:52.360]  and would like things to stay smooth, but sometimes stagnation leads to total destruction.
[4:36:53.400 --> 4:36:59.160]  And so if I was the new order, I would back off and not escalate this, but they can't help their
[4:36:59.160 --> 4:37:04.280]  nature up in their ivory towers and their macho minions want to march off against the republic.
[4:37:04.280 --> 4:37:09.000]  And I'm just telling you, they were destined from the foundations of this country for this
[4:37:09.000 --> 4:37:13.640]  second revolution to happen and they will fail. Just like they failed with the Shays Rebellion,
[4:37:13.640 --> 4:37:16.600]  just like they failed every other time, just like they failed with Andrew Jackson.
[4:37:17.320 --> 4:37:21.800]  We're praying for peace, preparing for war.
[4:37:25.160 --> 4:37:31.800]  So Jason, do you go out and train then? Sure. Oh yeah. Well, who's the target?
[4:37:32.920 --> 4:37:36.520]  When you do that, who's the, who's the, the imagined target? The attacker.
[4:37:36.520 --> 4:37:38.760]  I don't have a target.
[4:37:41.640 --> 4:37:46.280]  Who in your mind are you, are you training preparing for?
[4:37:48.040 --> 4:37:50.040]  Domestic or foreign enemies of the constitution.
[4:37:51.400 --> 4:37:54.440]  So in other words, domestic, then you're talking in the federal government?
[4:37:55.240 --> 4:38:00.280]  Anyone who is domestic or foreign, any domestic or foreign enemy?
[4:38:02.200 --> 4:38:05.160]  Because you swear in oath to protect and defend the constitution
[4:38:05.160 --> 4:38:09.160]  from all enemies, foreign and domestic. But you're actually afraid for your life and your
[4:38:09.160 --> 4:38:15.800]  family's lives? Governments killed 200 million people last century alone. We better be.
[4:38:15.800 --> 4:38:17.880]  Number one cause of unnatural deaths, government.
[4:38:20.520 --> 4:38:26.360]  Okay, I'm learning. I'm learning. I mean, I, I mean, have you seen Operation Valkyrie
[4:38:26.360 --> 4:38:31.720]  with Tom Cruise? It's very accurate, historical. You know, we have a Hitlerian government
[4:38:31.720 --> 4:38:36.600]  forming, but it's not in the personage of, of, of one dictator. It's a system. So we're trying
[4:38:36.600 --> 4:38:40.920]  in the information war to peacefully counter that, but the system wants to use force.
[4:38:40.920 --> 4:38:45.000]  They want to start a war. They stage attacks against themselves. Have you read Operation
[4:38:45.000 --> 4:38:50.040]  Northwood's US government plan to terrorize its own cities as a pretext to crack down on enemies?
[4:38:50.040 --> 4:38:58.040]  No. We're fighting to stop that. We are working for peace every day, but we're saying we're not
[4:38:58.040 --> 4:39:03.640]  your slaves. We're not going to be taken to your forced labor camp and they are setting up forced
[4:39:03.640 --> 4:39:11.160]  labor camps where the civilian inmate labor camp program, the FEMA legislation, the gulag
[4:39:11.160 --> 4:39:19.880]  archipelago that's been set up in this country. Anything else, sir? Yeah, I think that, you know,
[4:39:19.880 --> 4:39:24.280]  the reason that these elite people are very successful is because they simply just have a goal
[4:39:24.280 --> 4:39:27.400]  and they get together and they talk about their goal and they talk about how they're going to
[4:39:27.400 --> 4:39:31.400]  achieve it and then they do it. And, you know, I wondered, you're, you're, you're the fit
[4:39:31.400 --> 4:39:35.880]  with fear, Alex. I'm sorry to, you know, you know that and I know that. I've never thought about
[4:39:35.880 --> 4:39:41.800]  articulating a goal and having a meeting and then talking about it and, and getting it.
[4:39:41.800 --> 4:39:46.040]  I guess you do a lot of that right on the radio show, but you ever considered having a meeting?
[4:39:46.040 --> 4:39:50.600]  Well, look at what we did with the posters. Everything I do has to be asymmetrical,
[4:39:50.600 --> 4:39:55.320]  where it's about everybody having power, everybody being a leader, leaderless resistance,
[4:39:55.320 --> 4:40:02.120]  a creed, an idea, a constitution, a manifesto. And so from Tokyo, Japan to London, England,
[4:40:02.120 --> 4:40:08.840]  Austin, Texas to, you know, the Toronto Star reporting every major road has Obama info wars.com
[4:40:08.840 --> 4:40:15.240]  posters or Obama tyrant posters everywhere. That was an example of just our listeners taking action
[4:40:15.240 --> 4:40:19.720]  to see how even if they shut the web off, we can still go out and effectively counter them.
[4:40:19.720 --> 4:40:26.120]  And I'm knocking on heaven's door. The more I become a leader and the more I do try to organize
[4:40:26.120 --> 4:40:32.760]  people, I do want to stay in the game and I'm not, I don't want to be, you know, killed by these
[4:40:32.760 --> 4:40:37.240]  people. And there's civilian I make labor camp program, army regulation 210 dash 35 operating
[4:40:37.240 --> 4:40:43.720]  right now with us citizens in them. So, but it's all done in a legalese. Oh, we take state and
[4:40:43.720 --> 4:40:48.440]  federal prisoners and put them on basis that the army runs and they took the old military basis
[4:40:48.440 --> 4:40:53.160]  as the old timers said in the 90s. Now that's in the new congressional bills are already built
[4:40:53.160 --> 4:40:56.440]  and set up. They go, we're going to be a community center of the camp. You'll need to go there
[4:40:56.440 --> 4:40:59.800]  because you're homeless. You're not allowed to be homeless anymore in California. You must go
[4:40:59.800 --> 4:41:05.240]  to the camp. We've sent cameras there and oh, we frisk you and oh, there's a brig and oh,
[4:41:05.880 --> 4:41:10.840]  you see, oh, you want to be in the camp because the economy's bad. Remember Germany and what the
[4:41:10.840 --> 4:41:15.400]  Soviets did. Oh, you need to come here and you got to work while you're here. We can't just feed
[4:41:15.400 --> 4:41:19.880]  you for free. Things are tough in America. We got to pay those tens of trillions back to those
[4:41:19.880 --> 4:41:25.480]  private banks. And again, as we're successful stopping all this happening, then the media say,
[4:41:25.480 --> 4:41:29.320]  Oh, look, it didn't happen because we're there fighting. But these bills are all there. The
[4:41:29.320 --> 4:41:34.840]  legislation's all there. It's all real. So do you think homeless shelters or camps as well?
[4:41:34.840 --> 4:41:39.480]  Well, that's how they're setting them up at old bases. Yes, I've been to military drills where
[4:41:39.480 --> 4:41:44.760]  they practice put putting up camps and minutes at sports stadiums and operation top off and
[4:41:44.760 --> 4:41:48.760]  in L.E. organized. Why can't it just be people helping other people to get back on their feet?
[4:41:48.760 --> 4:41:52.520]  No, no, no, no, no, no, no. I'm telling you that they say the FEMA camps
[4:41:54.040 --> 4:41:59.080]  are going to have prisoners on them. But then also they when they're psychologically conditioning
[4:41:59.080 --> 4:42:04.200]  the troops, they have it where role players scream I want in the camp. And then they frisk
[4:42:04.200 --> 4:42:08.520]  you and take your kids when you're in the camp. So so that's how they roll the camps out.
[4:42:08.520 --> 4:42:12.760]  Hitler didn't say I'm going to send you to camps and kill you. This was a community center for
[4:42:12.760 --> 4:42:18.600]  you and your family. I mean, they're just trying to help homeless people because they had their
[4:42:18.600 --> 4:42:22.920]  economy shut down with a no work list, which they now have the no fly list will be a no gun
[4:42:22.920 --> 4:42:28.760]  by list and a no work list. Those bills have been introduced. Your card, no work, you not have job.
[4:42:29.640 --> 4:42:33.720]  No more. They're going to send they're sending feds out a new federal regulations to try to
[4:42:33.720 --> 4:42:37.640]  shut down the ebay accounts that are private. They're trying to shut down the garage sales.
[4:42:37.640 --> 4:42:41.480]  They're arresting Amish people selling eggs on the side of the road. They have the animal ID,
[4:42:41.480 --> 4:42:46.440]  the premises ID to take over the farms and ranches. It's all happening. He has erected
[4:42:46.440 --> 4:42:53.400]  swarms of new agencies and sent forth his agents to eat out our substance. Anything else caller?
[4:42:54.760 --> 4:42:59.000]  No, thanks, Alex. You're a brilliant investigative journalist. All right. God bless you, Jason.
[4:42:59.000 --> 4:43:05.320]  Robert in Kentucky. Robert, you're on the air. Thank you, Alex. I appreciate talking to you and
[4:43:05.320 --> 4:43:12.440]  Carol. I got out of Marine Corps in 1991. I knew something was wrong, but I couldn't put my finger
[4:43:12.440 --> 4:43:19.560]  on it after just the countless things that I had seen while I was in the Marine Corps. I got out,
[4:43:19.560 --> 4:43:25.400]  went to join the Kentucky militia. A month later, the president shot two state troopers. I thought
[4:43:25.400 --> 4:43:31.720]  of it that now, you know, I don't know what this is, but I want no part of it. You're saying the
[4:43:31.720 --> 4:43:40.360]  president of your militia shot two state troopers. Yes. And I backed off, you know, no, didn't want
[4:43:40.360 --> 4:43:47.960]  any part of it. Later on after I woke up, you know, I decided there was a need for something,
[4:43:47.960 --> 4:43:57.240]  but big organized militias. I just didn't feel that was right. So I found four or five buddies.
[4:43:57.240 --> 4:44:03.080]  We all think the same. We all believe the same. We're all gun owners. We're all proud Americans,
[4:44:03.080 --> 4:44:09.160]  you know, behind together. Yeah, really. I want you to finish up your last caller, but what we
[4:44:09.160 --> 4:44:14.440]  see is people that are just going to watch each other's backs. These are like a mutual covenant
[4:44:14.440 --> 4:44:21.880]  to come to each other's aid, which is a normal human thing to do. It's abnormal that we're not
[4:44:21.880 --> 4:44:25.960]  close to the land. It's abnormal. People don't question where power comes from for a light bulb
[4:44:25.960 --> 4:44:30.920]  or where meat comes from or where vegetables come from. So I think it's really people
[4:44:33.320 --> 4:44:37.400]  at a fundamental level, just getting back to their roots of being human beings. But
[4:44:38.200 --> 4:44:45.640]  do you concur with that, Robert? Yes, I do. I mean, every day there is a video of, you know,
[4:44:45.640 --> 4:44:50.280]  police running rampant. I know a lot of them are good guys, but every day there's a new video.
[4:44:50.280 --> 4:44:56.280]  Two cases within the last three months of a bank-making mistake and people being forced out
[4:44:56.280 --> 4:45:03.960]  of homes that are paid for, you know, simply when it all it would take was one hour a day to get the
[4:45:03.960 --> 4:45:09.480]  two corresponding banks together and get this fund figured out. But no, they immediately send in the
[4:45:09.480 --> 4:45:15.800]  Sheriff's Department's watchings who immediately follow orders as if no big deal and there's no
[4:45:15.800 --> 4:45:22.120]  recourse. You just busted in someone's private property, made them leave, tore their furniture up,
[4:45:22.120 --> 4:45:28.680]  and it was all paid for it. Oops, it was a mistake. Well, not a house. No. I'm sorry. Go ahead.
[4:45:31.960 --> 4:45:37.800]  I talked to Avery. What are you saying about your house? I said, not going to happen at my house.
[4:45:37.800 --> 4:45:43.320]  Not going to happen at my buddy's house. You know, somebody makes a computer mistake. That's fine.
[4:45:43.320 --> 4:45:49.160]  But if a house is bought and paid for, mistake or not, nobody has the right to come in at gunpoint.
[4:45:49.160 --> 4:45:53.880]  I don't care if they have a badge. Yeah, I saw that on CNN. They're taking houses now that are
[4:45:53.880 --> 4:46:03.000]  paid for. I mean, just all sorts of chicanery going on and... Chippewa. She does not live on
[4:46:03.000 --> 4:46:09.160]  the reservation, but if there is one people who know how tyrannical American government can be,
[4:46:09.160 --> 4:46:15.320]  it is the Native Americans. And believe you me, she's a strong supporter of everything we do.
[4:46:17.160 --> 4:46:21.720]  The first act of terrorism was not the World Trade Center. It was called Wounded Me,
[4:46:21.720 --> 4:46:28.280]  and it was committed by American troops. Well, the people wonder about biological weapons. I have
[4:46:29.000 --> 4:46:37.400]  early 1724, I believe. You can pull it up online. It's famous. The British officers manuals about
[4:46:37.400 --> 4:46:41.560]  take the blankets that your sick men have been on, give it to them quickly because
[4:46:42.600 --> 4:46:49.640]  the disease seems to only last for a day, and give it to the natives. I mean, there's stuff with
[4:46:50.440 --> 4:46:56.360]  the Mongols catapulting plague bodies over Chinese walls, you know, thousands of years ago.
[4:46:56.360 --> 4:47:03.560]  But I mean, the cold bloodedness of this and... But go ahead and finish your point, sir.
[4:47:03.560 --> 4:47:10.360]  You know, my point is, I have four or five friends. We are a tight unit, and to tell you the truth,
[4:47:10.360 --> 4:47:14.920]  after I got out of the Marine Corps, I started reading some of Michael Carly's work. I don't
[4:47:14.920 --> 4:47:20.840]  really support... I'm going to say Tether's activity, but if there was one group who stood against
[4:47:20.840 --> 4:47:26.600]  the Roth government, the opposition government, it was the IRA. You have four or five people in
[4:47:26.600 --> 4:47:32.360]  the cell. You take care of each other. Period. All right. I appreciate your call. I appreciate
[4:47:32.360 --> 4:47:37.560]  you calling in. That's a place to end it. Go ahead and take us out of here. I would just add in
[4:47:37.560 --> 4:47:42.280]  closing, look at the schools. The children are being trained how to live as prisoners. They're
[4:47:42.280 --> 4:47:46.920]  taking DNA tests for 36 years secretly from everybody who's born. I was told that by Congress
[4:47:46.920 --> 4:47:52.280]  about a decade ago. It's now been declassified. They've got cameras in the school bathrooms.
[4:47:52.280 --> 4:47:56.920]  They're training the kids to tattle on their parents. They're setting up all these Stasi groups.
[4:47:56.920 --> 4:48:01.480]  They tell locals, come to an FBI meeting. We're going to teach you how to fight al-Qaeda. You get
[4:48:01.480 --> 4:48:06.280]  there. They spend 15 minutes on al-Qaeda. The rest of the meeting is about spying on your neighbors.
[4:48:06.280 --> 4:48:10.120]  Are they spanking their kids? Do they have marijuana plants? I mean, the government has
